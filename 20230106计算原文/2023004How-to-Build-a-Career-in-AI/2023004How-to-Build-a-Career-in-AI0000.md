## Introduction: Coding AI Is the New Literacy

Today we take it for granted that many people know how to read and write. Someday, I hope, it will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.

Several hundred years ago, society didn’t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small number of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and writing. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.

Words enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-tomachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication becomes ever more important.

Traditional software engineering — writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences of steps to execute — has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming classes use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, and data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This technology offers an even better pathway to coding.

Many Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman behind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own website software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).

But AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might enable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant’s staffing and supply chain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza — my favorite! — so he could make more Hawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.

Uses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data. Thus, a wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived insights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding even more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness data to make their lives richer.

I hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic traditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this new form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.

编码人工智能是新的文化

今天，我们想当然地认为，许多人知道如何阅读和写作。我希望有一天，人们知道如何编写代码，特别是为人工智能编写代码，会变得同样普遍。

几百年前，社会并不认为语言素养是一项必要的技能。少数人学会了阅读和写作，其他人都让他们做阅读和写作。识字花了几个世纪才传播开来，现在社会因此变得更加富裕。

文字使人与人之间的交流更深入。代码是人机交流的最深层形式。随着机器在日常生活中变得越来越重要，这种交流变得越来越重要。

传统的软件工程 —— 编写程序，明确告诉计算机要执行的步骤序列 —— 一直是代码素养的主要途径。许多入门编程课程以创建视频游戏或建立网站为例。但人工智能、机器学习和数据科学提供了计算机从数据中提取知识的新范式。这项技术提供了一条更好的编码途径。

很多星期天，我都会从附近的披萨店买一片披萨。柜台后面的绅士几乎没有理由学习如何构建视频游戏或编写自己的网站软件（除了个人成长和获得新技能的乐趣）。

但人工智能和数据科学即使对披萨制造商来说也有很大的价值。线性回归模型可能使他能够更好地估计需求，从而优化餐厅的人员配备和供应链。他可以更好地预测夏威夷披萨的销售 —— 我的最爱！这样他就可以提前做更多的夏威夷馅饼，减少顾客等待的时间。

人工智能和数据科学的使用几乎可以在任何产生数据的情况下找到。因此，与传统软件工程相比，各种各样的职业将发现定制人工智能应用程序和数据衍生见解的更多用途。这使得面向人工智能的编码比传统编码更有价值。它可以让无数个人利用数据让他们的生活更加丰富。

我希望构建基本人工智能应用程序的承诺，甚至比构建基本传统软件的承诺更能鼓励更多的人学习如何编码。如果社会接受这种新形式的读写能力，我们都会受益。
