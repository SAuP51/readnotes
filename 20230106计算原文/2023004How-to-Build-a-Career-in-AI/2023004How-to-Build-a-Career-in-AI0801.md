## 0801. Using Informational Interviews to Find the Right Job

If you’re preparing to switch roles (say, taking a job as a machine learning engineer for the first time) or industries (say, working in an AI tech company for the first time), there’s a lot about your target job that you probably don’t know. A technique known as informational interviewing is a great way to learn.

An informational interview involves finding someone in a company or role you’d like to know more about and informally interviewing them about their work. Such conversations are separate from searching for a job. In fact, it’s helpful to interview people who hold positions that align with your interests well before you’re ready to kick off a job search.

✓ Informational interviews are particularly relevant to AI. Because the field is evolving, many companies use job titles in inconsistent ways. In one company, data scientists might be expected mainly to analyze business data and present conclusions on a slide deck. In another, they might write and maintain production code. An informational interview can help you sort out what the AI people in a particular company actually do.

✓ With the rapid expansion of opportunities in AI, many people will be taking on an AI job for the first time. In this case, an informational interview can be invaluable for learning what happens and what skills are needed to do the job well. For example, you can learn what algorithms, deployment processes, and software stacks a particular company uses. You may be surprised — if you’re not already familiar with the data-centric AI movement — to learn how much time most machine learning engineers spend iteratively cleaning datasets.

Prepare for informational interviews by researching the interviewee and company in advance, so you can arrive with thoughtful questions. You might ask:

✓ What do you do in a typical week or day?

✓ What are the most important tasks in this role?

✓ What skills are most important for success?

✓ How does your team work together to accomplish its goals?

✓ What is the hiring process?

✓ Considering candidates who stood out in the past, what enabled them to shine?

Finding someone to interview isn’t always easy, but many people who are in senior positions today received help when they were new from those who had entered the field ahead of them, and many are eager to pay it forward. If you can reach out to someone who’s already in your network perhaps a friend who made the transition ahead of you or someone who attended the same school as you — that’s great! Meetups such as Pie & AI can also help you build your network.

Finally, be polite and professional, and thank the people you’ve interviewed. And when you get a chance, please pay it forward as well and help someone coming up after you. If you receive a request for an informational interview from someone in the DeepLearning.AI community, I hope you’ll lean in to help them take a step up! If you’re interested in learning more about informational interviews, I recommend this article from the UC Berkeley Career Center.

I’ve mentioned a few times the importance of your network and community. People you’ve met, beyond providing valuable information, can also play an invaluable role by referring you to potential employers.

利用信息面试找到合适的工作

如果你正准备转换角色（比如说，第一次接受机器学习工程师的工作）或行业（比如说，第一次在人工智能科技公司工作），关于你的目标工作，有很多你可能不知道的东西。一种被称为信息面试的技术是一种很好的学习方式。

信息面试包括在一家公司或某个职位上找到你想更多了解的人，并就他们的工作进行非正式面试。这样的对话和找工作是分开的。事实上，在你准备开始找工作之前，面试那些职位与你兴趣相符的人是很有帮助的。

信息面试与人工智能尤其相关。因为这个领域在不断发展，许多公司使用职称的方式不一致。在一家公司，数据科学家可能主要是分析业务数据并在幻灯片上展示结论。在另一种情况下，他们可能编写和维护生产代码。信息面试可以帮助你理清特定公司的人工智能人员实际上在做什么。

随着人工智能领域机会的迅速扩大，许多人将第一次从事人工智能工作。在这种情况下，一个信息性的面试对于学习什么是非常宝贵的以及做好这项工作需要什么技能。例如，您可以了解特定公司使用什么算法、部署流程和软件堆栈。如果你还不熟悉以数据为中心的人工智能运动，你可能会惊讶地发现大多数机器学习工程师花了多少时间迭代清理数据集。

提前调查受访者和公司，为信息面试做准备，这样你就可以带着深思熟虑的问题来。你可能会问：

你一周或一天都做些什么？

这个角色最重要的任务是什么？

什么技能对成功最重要？

你的团队如何合作来实现目标？

招聘流程是怎样的？

考虑到过去脱颖而出的候选人，是什么让他们大放异彩？

找人面试并不总是容易的，但今天许多身居高位的人在刚入职时从那些在他们之前进入该领域的人那里得到了帮助，许多人渴望向前支付。如果你能联系到已经在你人际网络中的人 —— 也许是比你先转型的朋友，或者是和你上同一所学校的人 —— 那太好了！像 Pie&AI 这样的聚会也可以帮助你建立你的人际网络。

最后，要有礼貌和专业，感谢你面试过的人。当你有机会的时候，请也向前支付，并帮助紧随你之后的人。如果你收到 DeepLearning.AI 社区中某人的信息面试请求，我希望你能帮助他们更上一层楼！如果你有兴趣了解更多关于信息面试的知识，我推荐这篇来自加州大学伯克利分校职业中心的文章。

我已经提到过几次你的人际网络和社区的重要性。你见过的人，除了提供有价值的信息，也可以通过把你介绍给潜在的雇主来发挥宝贵的作用。
