## 1001. Keys to Building a Career in AI

The path to career success in AI is more complex than what I can cover in one short eBook.

Hopefully the previous chapters will give you momentum to move forward.

Here are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success:

1 Teamwork:

When we tackle large projects, we succeed better by working in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate with, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. Thus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. (I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)

2 Networking:

I hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party to smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity that borders on horrific. I’d much rather stay home and read a book. Nonetheless, I’m fortunate to have found many genuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for and who I count on as well. No person is an island, and having a strong professional network can help propel you forward in the moments when you need help or advice. In lieu of networking, I’ve found it more helpful to think about building up a community. So instead of trying to build up my personal network, I focus instead on building up the communities that I’m part of. This has the side effect of helping me meet more people and make friends as well.

3 Job search

Of all the steps in building a career, this one tends to receive the most attention. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad advice about this on the internet. (For example, many articles urge taking an adversarial attitude toward potential employers, which I don’t think is helpful.) Although it may seem like finding a job is the ultimate goal, it’s just one small step in the long journey of a career.

4 Personal discipline

Few people will know whether you spend your weekends learning, or binge watching TV — but they will notice the difference over time. Many successful people develop good habits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal relationships, work, learning, and self-care. Such habits help them move forward while staying healthy.

5 Altruism

I find that people who aim to lift others during every step of their own journey often achieve better outcomes for themselves. How can we help others even as we build an exciting career for ourselves?

人工智能职业生涯的关键

人工智能职业成功之路比我在一本简短的电子书中所能涵盖的要复杂得多。希望前面的章节能给你前进的动力。在你规划成功之路时，还需要考虑以下几点：

1、团队合作：当我们处理大型项目时，团队合作比单独合作更能成功。与他人合作、影响他人和被他人影响的能力至关重要。因此，人际交往和沟通技巧真的很重要。（顺便说一句，我过去很不善于沟通。）

2、网络：我讨厌网络！作为一个内向的人，不得不去参加一个聚会，微笑着和尽可能多的人握手，这是一件近乎可怕的事情。我宁愿呆在家里看书。尽管如此，我很幸运在人工智能中找到了许多真正的朋友；我很乐意为之奋斗的人，也是我所依靠的人。没有人是一座孤岛，拥有强大的职业关系网可以在你需要帮助或建议的时候帮助你前进。我发现考虑建立一个社区比建立关系网更有帮助。因此，我没有试图建立我的个人关系网，而是专注于建立我所在的社区。这有帮助我认识更多的人和交朋友的副作用。

3、求职。在建立职业生涯的所有步骤中，这一步往往最受关注。不幸的是，网上有很多关于这个的坏建议。（例如，许多文章敦促对潜在雇主采取敌对态度，我认为这是没有帮助的。）虽然看起来找工作是最终目标，但这只是职业生涯漫长旅程中的一小步。

4、个人纪律。很少有人会知道你周末是在学习，还是在狂看电视 —— 但随着时间的推移，他们会注意到不同之处。许多成功人士在饮食、锻炼、睡眠、人际关系、工作、学习和自我保健方面养成了良好的习惯。这样的习惯帮助他们在保持健康的同时前进 。

5、利他主义。我发现，那些在自己旅程的每一步都以提升他人为目标的人，往往会为自己取得更好的结果。即使我们为自己建立了一个令人兴奋的职业生涯，我们如何帮助他人？
