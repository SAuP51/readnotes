## 1101. Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

Before we dive into the final chapter of this book, I’d like to address the serious matter of newcomers to AI sometimes experiencing imposter syndrome, where someone — regardless of their success in the field — wonders if they’re a fraud and really belong in the AI community. I want to make sure this doesn’t discourage you or anyone else from growing in AI.

Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI community, then I welcome you with open arms. If you want to join us, you fully belong with us!

An estimated 70 percent of people experience some form of imposter syndrome at some point. Many talented people have spoken publicly about this experience, including former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and Atlassian co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes. It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you’ve never experienced this yourself, that’s great! I hope you’ll join me in encouraging and welcoming everyone who wants to join our community.

AI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is easy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you’ve succeeded at sucking at AI — congratulations, you’re on your way!

I once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when logistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my implementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging to read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter (that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).

So if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it’s okay. We’ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone who has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.

Here are some things that can help.

✓ Do you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don’t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, use discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don’t support your growth, find ones who do. I’m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community and hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.

✓ No one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well. If what you do well is understand and explain to your friends one-tenth of the articles in The Batch, then you’re on your way! Let’s work on getting you to understand two-tenths of the articles.

My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my one-year-old son. No matter how far along you are — if you’re at least as knowledgeable as a three-year-old — you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too, as others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. When you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any doubts that you are already one of us.

AI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it to feel at home as a member of our community. Let’s work together to make it happen.

Final Thoughts

Make Every Day Count

Every year on my birthday, I get to thinking about the days behind and those that may lie ahead.

Maybe you’re good at math; I’m sure you’ll be able to answer the following question via a quick calculation. But let me ask you a question, and please answer from your gut, without calculating.

How many days is a typical human lifespan?

20,000 days

100,000 days

1 million days

5 million days

When I ask friends, many choose a number in the hundreds of thousands. (Many others can’t resist calculating the answer, to my annoyance!)

When I was a grad student, I remember plugging my statistics into a mortality calculator to figure out my life expectancy. The calculator said I could expect to live a total of 27,649 days. It struck me how small this number is. I printed it in a large font and pasted it on my office wall as a daily reminder.

That’s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn, build for the future, and help others. Whatever you’re doing today, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?

克服冒名顶替综合症

在我们进入本书的最后一章之前，我想解决人工智能新手有时会经历冒名顶替综合症的严重问题，即有人 —— 不管他们在该领域是否成功 —— 怀疑他们是否是骗子，是否真的属于人工智能社区。我想确保这不会阻碍你或其他任何人在人工智能领域的成长。

让我明确一点：如果你想成为 AI 社区的一员，那么我张开双臂欢迎你。如果你想加入我们，你完全属于我们！

据估计，70% 的人在某个时候经历过某种形式的冒名顶替综合症。许多有才华的人都公开谈论过这段经历，包括前脸书首席运营官雪莉·桑德伯格、美国第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马、演员汤姆·汉克斯和 Atlassian 联合首席执行官迈克·坎农 —— 布鲁克斯。它发生在我们的社区，甚至发生在有成就的人中间。如果你自己从来没有经历过这些，那太好了！我希望你能和我一起鼓励和欢迎每一个想加入我们社区的人。

人工智能在技术上是复杂的，它有相当一部分聪明和高度能干的人。但是人们很容易忘记，要变得擅长任何事情，第一步是吮吸它。如果你已经成功地吮吸了人工智能 —— 恭喜你，你已经上路了！

我曾经努力理解线性回归背后的数学原理。当逻辑回归在我的数据上表现奇怪时，我感到很困惑，我花了几天时间才在我的基本神经网络实现中找到一个错误。今天，我仍然发现许多研究论文很难阅读，我最近在调整神经网络超参数时犯了一个明显的错误（幸运的是，一位工程师同事发现并修复了这个错误）。

因此，如果你也觉得人工智能的某些部分具有挑战性，没关系。我们都经历过。我保证，每个发表过开创性人工智能论文的人都曾在某个时候遇到过类似的技术挑战。

这里有一些事情可以帮助。

你有支持你的导师或同龄人吗？如果你还没有，参加 Pie&AI 或其他活动，使用讨论板，并努力找到一些。如果你的导师或经理不支持你的成长，找到那些有成长的人。我还在研究如何发展一个支持性的人工智能社区，并希望让每个人都更容易找到并给予支持。

没有人是所有事情的专家。认识到你擅长什么。如果你做得很好的是理解并向你的朋友解释这一批文章中的十分之一，那么你就是在路上！让我们努力让你理解十分之二的文章。

我三岁的女儿（她几乎数不到 12）经常试着教我一岁的儿子一些东西。不管你走了多远 —— 如果你至少和一个三岁的孩子一样有知识 —— 你可以鼓励和鼓舞你身后的人。这样做也会对你有所帮助，因为你身后的其他人会认可你的专长，并鼓励你不断发展。当你邀请其他人加入 AI 社区时，我希望你会这样做，这也减少了你已经是我们中的一员的任何怀疑。

人工智能是我们世界如此重要的一部分，我希望每个想成为其中一部分的人都能作为我们社区的一员有宾至如归的感觉。让我们一起努力实现它。

最后的想法

让每一天都有意义

每年生日那天，我都会思考过去的日子和未来的日子。

也许你擅长数学；我相信你通过快速计算就能回答下面的问题。但是让我问你一个问题，请从你的直觉，没有计算。

典型的人类寿命是多少天？

20,000 天

100,000 天

100 万天

500 万天

当我问朋友时，许多人选择几十万中的一个数字。（让我恼火的是，很多人都忍不住要计算答案！）

当我还是研究生的时候，我记得把我的统计数据输入死亡率计算器来计算我的预期寿命。计算器显示我总共可以活 27,649 天 。我突然意识到这个数字有多小。我把它用大字体打印出来，贴在办公室的墙上，作为日常提醒。

这就是我们必须和所爱的人一起度过的所有日子，学习，建设未来，帮助他人。无论你今天在做什么，它值你生命的 1/3 万吗？
