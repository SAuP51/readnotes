## 0901. Finding the Right AI Job for You

In this chapter, I’d like to discuss some fine points of finding a job.

The typical job search follows a fairly predictable path.

✓ Research roles and companies online or by talking to friends.

✓ Optionally, arrange informal informational interviews with people in companies that appeal to you. ✓ Either apply directly or, if you can, get a referral from someone on the inside.

✓ Interview with companies that give you an invitation.

✓ Receive one or more offers and pick one. Or, if you don’t receive an offer, ask for feedback

from the interviewers, human resources staff, online discussion boards, or anyone in your

network who can help you plot your next move.

Although the process may be familiar, every job search is different. Here are some tips to increase the odds you’ll find a position that supports your thriving career and enables you to keep growing.

Pay attention to the fundamentals. A compelling resume, portfolio of technical projects, and a strong interview performance will unlock doors. Even if you have a referral from someone in a company, a resume and portfolio will be your first contact with many people who don’t already know about you. Update your resume and make sure it clearly presents your education and experience relevant to the role you want. Customize your communications with each company to explain why you’re a good fit. Before an interview, ask the recruiter what to expect. Take time to review and practice answers to common interview questions, brush up key skills, and study technical materials to make sure they are fresh in your mind. Afterward, take notes to help you remember what was said.

Proceed respectfully and responsibly. Approach interviews and offer negotiations with a win-win mindset. Outrage spreads faster than reasonableness on social media, so a story about how an employer underpaid someone gets amplified, whereas stories about how an employer treated someone fairly do not. The vast majority of employers are ethical and fair, so don’t let stories about the small fraction of mistreated individuals sway your approach. If you’re leaving a job, exit gracefully. Give your employer ample notice, give your full effort through your last hour on the job, transition unfinished business as best you can, and leave in a way that honors the responsibilities you were entrusted with.

Choose who to work with. It’s tempting to take a position because of the projects you’ll work on. But the teammates you’ll work with are at least equally important. We’re influenced by people around us, so your colleagues will make a big difference. For example, if your friends smoke, the odds increase that you, too, will smoke. I don’t know of a study that shows this, but I’m pretty sure that if most of your colleagues work hard, learn continuously, and build AI to benefit all people, you’re likely to do the same. (By the way, some large companies won’t tell you who your teammates will be until you’ve accepted an offer. In this case, be persistent and keep pushing to identify and speak with potential teammates. Strict policies may make it impossible to accommodate you, but in my mind, that increases the risk of accepting the offer, as it increases the odds you’ll end up with a manager or teammates who aren’t a good fit.)

Get help from your community. Most of us go job hunting only a small number of times in our careers, so few of us get much practice at doing it well. Collectively, though, people in your immediate community probably have a lot of experience. Don’t be shy about calling on them. Friends and associates can provide advice, share inside knowledge, and refer you to others who may help. I got a lot of help from supportive friends and mentors when I applied for my first faculty position, and many of the tips they gave me were very helpful.

I know that the job-search process can be intimidating. Instead of viewing it as a great leap, consider an incremental approach. Start by identifying possible roles and conducting a handful of informational interviews. If these conversations tell you that you have more learning to do before you’re ready to apply, that’s great! At least you have a clear path forward. The most important part of any journey is to take the first step, and that step can be a small one.

找到适合你的人工智能工作

在这一章中，我想讨论一些找工作的要点。

典型的求职遵循一条相当可预测的路径。

在网上或通过与朋友交谈来研究角色和公司。

或者，安排与你感兴趣的公司的人进行非正式的信息面试。

要么直接申请，要么，如果可以的话，从内部人士那里获得推荐。

面试给你邀请的公司。

收到一个或多个报价并选择一个。或者，如果你没有收到工作邀请，请你提供反馈来自面试官、人力资源人员、在线讨论板，或者你人际网络中任何能帮你策划下一步行动的人。

虽然过程可能很熟悉，但每次找工作都不一样。这里有一些建议，可以增加你找到一份支持你蓬勃发展的职业生涯并让你不断成长的工作的几率。

注意基本面。一份引人注目的简历、技术项目组合和出色的面试表现将会打开大门。即使你有一个推荐人在公司、简历和作品集将是你与许多还不了解你的人的第一次接触。更新你的简历，确保它清楚地展示了你的教育和与你想要的角色相关的经历。定制你与每家公司的沟通，解释为什么你很适合。面试前，问问招聘人员会有什么期待。花点时间复习和练习常见面试问题的答案，温习关键技能，学习技术材料，确保它们在你的脑海中记忆犹新。之后，做笔记来帮助你记住所说的话。

尊重并负责任地进行。以双赢的心态进行面试和谈判。愤怒比理性在社交媒体上传播得更快，所以一个关于雇主如何少付某人工资会被放大，而关于雇主如何公平对待某人的故事不会被放大。绝大多数雇主都是道德和公平的，所以不要让一小部分被虐待的人的故事动摇你的方法。如果你要离职，优雅地离开。给你的雇主充分的通知，在工作的最后一个小时全力以赴，尽你所能完成未完成的事情，以一种尊重你被赋予的责任的方式离开。

选择和谁一起工作。因为你将要从事的项目，接受一个职位是很有诱惑力的。但是和你一起工作的队友至少同样重要。我们受我们周围的人，所以你的同事会有很大的不同。例如，如果你的朋友吸烟，你也吸烟的几率就会增加。我不知道有研究表明这一点，但我很确定，如果你的大多数同事努力工作，不断学习，并建立人工智能来造福所有人，你很可能也会这样做。（顺便说一句，有些大公司在你接受邀请之前不会告诉你谁是你的队友。在这种情况下，要坚持不懈，不断努力寻找潜在的队友并与之交流。严格的政策可能会让你无法适应，但在我看来，这增加了接受邀请的风险，因为这增加了你最终与不合适的经理或队友在一起的可能性。）

从你的社区获得帮助。我们大多数人在职业生涯中只去找工作几次，所以很少有人能做好工作。但是，总的来说，你的直接社区可能有很多经验。不要羞于拜访他们。朋友和同事可以提供建议，分享内部知识，并把你介绍给其他可能有所帮助的人。当我申请我的第一个教师职位时，我从支持我的朋友和导师那里得到了很多帮助，他们给我的许多建议都很有帮助。

我知道找工作的过程可能会令人生畏。不要把它看作是一个巨大的飞跃，而是考虑一种渐进的方法 。首先确定可能的角色，并进行一些信息面试。如果这些对话告诉你，在你准备申请之前，你还有更多的东西要学，那太好了！至少你有一条清晰的前进道路。任何旅程中最重要的部分是迈出第一步，这一步可以是很小的一步。
