## 0101. Three Steps to Career Growth

The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting careers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward. Over many years, I’ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in companies large and small, navigate careers in AI.

Here’s a framework for charting your own course.

Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to deepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job. These steps stack on top of each other:

LEARNING

Initially, you focus on learning foundational skills. Chapters with the cover topics about learning foundational technical skills.

PROJECTS

After having gained foundational technical skills, you will begin working on projects. During this period, you’ll also keep learning. Chapters with the focus on projects.

JOB

Later, you will work on finding a job. Throughout this process, you’ll continue to learn and work on meaningful projects. Chapters with the focus on a job search.

These phases apply in a wide range of professions, but AI involves unique elements. For example:

LEARNING

Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:

AI is nascent, and many technologies are still evolving. While the foundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing and coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these foundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more important in AI than fields that are more mature.

PROJECTS

Working on projects often means collaborating with stakeholders who lack expertise in AI:

This can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s timeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the highly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project management: How can you come up with a plan for building a system when you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target accuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may be necessary to address post-deployment drift.

JOB

Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles:

While searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in other sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are still trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people who have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different than anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to educate potential employers about some elements of your work.

As you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and allies who can help you — and who you strive to help — makes the path easier. This is true whether you’re taking your first steps or you’ve been on the journey for years.

职业发展的三个步骤

人工智能的快速崛起导致了人工智能工作的快速崛起，许多人正在这个领域建立令人兴奋的职业生涯。职业生涯是一个长达几十年的旅程，道路并不平坦。多年来，我有幸看到成千上万的学生，以及大大小小公司的工程师，在人工智能领域导航职业生涯。

这里有一个规划你自己路线的框架。

职业发展的三个关键步骤是学习基本技能、参与项目（深化你的技能、建立投资组合和创造影响） 和找工作。这些步骤相互堆叠：

学习

最初，你专注于学习基本技能。涵盖学习基本技术技能主题的章节。

项目

获得基本技术技能后，您将开始做项目。在此期间，你也会不断学习。以项目为重点的章节。

工作

以后，你会努力找工作。在整个过程中过程中，你将继续学习和从事有意义的项目。以找工作为重点的章节。

这些阶段适用于广泛的职业，但人工智能涉及独特的元素。例如：

学习基本技能是一个终生的过程： 人工智能刚刚起步，许多技术仍在发展。虽然机器学习和深度学习的基础正在成熟 —— 课程是掌握它们的有效方式 —— 但除了这些基础，跟上不断变化的技术在人工智能中比更成熟的领域更重要。

从事项目工作通常意味着与缺乏人工智能专业知识的利益相关者合作： 这使得寻找合适的项目、估计项目的时间表和投资回报以及设定期望值变

得具有挑战性。此外，人工智能项目的高度迭代性质导致了项目管理中的特殊挑战：当你事先不知道需要多长时间才能达到目标准确性时，你如何才能提出构建系统的计划？即使在系统达到目标之后，也可能需要进一步的迭代来解决部署后的漂移。

关于人工智能技能和工作角色的不一致意见： 虽然在人工智能领域找工作可能与在其他领域找工作类似，但也有重要的区别。许多公司仍在试图弄清楚他们需要哪些人工智能技能，以及如何雇用拥有这些技能的人。你做过的事情可能与面试官见过的任何事情都有很大不同，你更有可能需要向潜在雇主介绍你工作中的一些元素。

当你经历每一步时，你也应该建立一个支持性的社区。拥有可以帮助你的朋友和盟友 —— 以及你努力帮助的人 —— 会让道路变得更容易。无论你是迈出第一步，还是已经走了多年，这都是事实。
