第一部分 古典风格的原理

1.0 导语

讲古典风格之前，我们要先了解什么是风格，以及一些常见风格与古典风格的区别。如果只能感觉一篇文章有风格，却不知道什么决定了风格，或者误以为调整字词就能形成风格，那么写好文章恐怕只是凭运气罢了。本书第一部分将带领大家认识不同风格，培养写作中的风格意识，选用一种比你的默认风格更实用、更自然的风格来进人写作的秘境。

结语：风格不是写作规范

本书希望成为一本古典风格学习指南，可以说对它的主题做了全面的分析。虽然本书默认读者的书写语言是英文，但这种风格不局限于某一门具体的语言。它是修昔底德等古希腊作家使用的风格，是十七世纪法国一批杰出作家使用的风格，尽管他们大多数人不会古希腊语；它是十八世纪法国化学家安托万·拉瓦锡使用的风格，是二十世纪美国的记者兼新闻评论员李伯龄使用的风格。本书讨论的原则是一种关于风格元素的立场，而不是一种或多种英语变体用法手册的依据。任何具备语言能力的人都能学古典风格，因为古典风格的原则像适用于英语一样，同样适用于日语或孟加拉语。

写作的概念比风格要广泛得多，我们已经尽力区分两者，但美国人常常混淆它们：写作的风格和英语的写作。大多数美国人在英语课上学写作，不少调查表明大多数美国人理解的英语无外乎拼写和用法（选择表达「可能」的情态动词用 can 还是 may，affect 与 effect 都能指「影响」，但前一个是动词后一个是名词，imply 和 infer 都能表达「暗示」但场景不同，等等，类似的例子不胜枚举）。

除了一些谈基本写作问题的书以外，还有大量且越来越多的相当于规范手册的书讨论惯用法和其他表面特征，这些都源于一种默认的假设：一个人只要掌握所有这些规范要点，就能写「英语」。形成这种假设的依据是了解事物就是了解它的表面细节。

有些人就常基于这种假设奚落别人，听起来无人可反驳。「X 怎么可能知道认识论（epistemology）？他连这个词都拼不出来！」口头语言也会有同样的轻视：「Y 怎么可能知道德加（Degas）？她连他的名字都念不出来！」这些话说出来几乎总是言之凿凿，虽然没一句有道理。任何一个人想说什么事物时，即使不会拼或不会念，完全有可能了解很多，这很普遍。

精通一本规范手册，掌握现在惯用的拼写规则，明确区分「allusion」（暗指）与「illusion」（幻想）和所有其他常用混淆词，不能说一定学不会标准英语。但这是最不可能学会的方式，就像马尔科姆·X（Malcolm X）想通过背诵字典来获得读写能力一样。问题是任何人想通过规范手册学会写作（字典也是语言规范手册的一种，就永远只是被动地接受建议；它们没有提供一组原则，让一个人理解这些原则后就可以不看手册。比如，一个会讲英语的人从不会写错句子顺序：他不太可能不确定是说「递给我糖浆」（Pass me the molasses）还是「我糖浆递给」（Me molasses pass the），还是这个人，但他可能会不确定「糖浆」（molasses）的正确拼写，即使他成为一家报纸的总编辑或一名英语教授。

作者要掌握一种风格，光做到准确还不够；即使一篇文章、一封书信、一则报道或是一本书完全「准确」，还是有可能表达不清；可能压根没有写出作者原本要表达的东西。这种表达，如果只是准确无误，哪怕有用，也只是一时的用处，时间久了就很难理解。夏尔·戴高乐（Charles de Gaulle）有一次去莫斯科进行国事访问时，用准确易懂的俄语发表演讲，让莫斯科人很吃惊。在那之前，没人知道他会讲俄语。这令一些国家的情报部门很难堪，以为是情报工作出了明显的纰漏，竟然不知道戴高乐会说什么语言，后来他们才发现没有弄错。戴高乐的确不会说俄语，他只是接受了训练，通过背诵录音正确读出俄语单词，并用一种显然是周密思考过的方式把它们组合一起，再用同样的方式抑扬顿挫地讲出来。这是一个演员娴熟运用技巧的表现。戴高乐的表现是轰动的，但这并没让他学会说俄语，他仍然对俄语一窍不通。

这本小书不是某种捷径，无法帮助你实现学写英语或任何其他语言这类不现实的目标。本书的目标不是教你怎么提升技巧怎么写英语这样模糊又泛泛无边的问题。本书有一个切实可行的目标，如何充分理解一个更具体的领域：古典风格，包括它在英语上的具体应用。第一个目标，「写英语」，和绝不会拼错单词一样不现实；第二个目标，写古典文章，就像写对语序一样能学会。如果你记不住「effect」和「affect」之间的差别，本书也帮不了你，笔者也不会赢得拼写比赛的冠军；如果我们以为学会写作就是学一种语言表面的偶然因素，没人能成为一个好作者。世上有哪个英语行家可以把《牛津英语词典》或《韦氏词典》中每一个单词都读出来、拼出来并用对呢？这能说明没有真正会说英语的人吗？一位有能力的作者完全可以掌握一种风格的原则，任何风格都不会是一组死板的规则。一旦理解这些原则并娴熟地运用起来，作者就能主动使用这种风格，这种风格会成为作者灵活运用的能力之一，就像轻松写对句子顺序一样。即使这种风格有它的限制，但创造和发现的空间是无限的；就像英语语序有它的限制，但形成意义和表达的空间是无限的；因为掌握一种写作风格就像掌握基本的语言能力一样，是一种需灵活运用的活动，不是某种死记硬背的表演。

### 1.1 The Concept of Style

「Style」is a word everybody uses, but almost no one can explain what it means. It is often understood as the inessential or even disreputable member of a two-term set: style and substance. This set of terms is elastic but in all its many applications, style is the subordinate term and, in the traditional American idiom, there is a persistent suggestion that we would be better off without it. Style is, at best, a harmless if unnecessary bit of window dressing. At worst, it is a polite name for fraud. There used to be a cigar company whose motto was「All Quality. No Style.」

When style is considered the opposite of substance, it seems optional and incidental, even when it is admired. In this way of framing things, substantive thought and meaning can be prior to style and completely separable from it. The identical thought or the identical meaning, it is suggested, can be expressed in many styles — or even in none at all, as when just plain integrity or the unvarnished truth is offered as an alternative to the adornments of style. Style, conceived this way, is something fancy that distracts us from what is essential; it is the varnish that makes the truth at least a little harder to see.

The notion that style is something completely separate from substance, so that substance can be offered「straight,」lies behind both the motto of the cigar company and William Butler Yeats's description of Bernard Shaw's writing, but in the second case the poet puts a high value on style and views writing in no style, while possible, to be something monstrously mechanical. Yeats apparently thought of his own characteristic poetic voice as「style.」It was a voice so compelling that attempts to imitate it have ruined quite a number of aspiring poets. Shaw's voice was not poetic in Yeats's sense, so Yeats considered Shaw to be a writer「without style.」Because he held the view that style is optional, Yeats could simultaneously view Shaw as「the most formidable man in modern letters,」able to write「with great effect,」and yet view Shaw's writing as「without music, without style, either good or bad.」He described Shaw as a nightmare sewing machine that clicked, shone, and smiled,「smiled perpetually.」

Whether style is viewed as spiritual, fraudulent, or something in between, any concept of style that treats it as optional is inadequate not only to writing but to any human action. Nothing we do can be done「simply」and in no style, because style is something inherent in action, not something added to it. In this respect, style is like the typeface in which a text is printed. We may overlook it, and frequently do, but it is always there. The styles we acquire unconsciously remain invisible to us as a rule, and routine actions can seem to be done in no style at all, even though their styles are obvious to experienced observers. A printer, a proofreader, or a type designer cannot fail to notice the type in which a text is printed, but for most of us, that typeface will have to be laid down beside a contrasting face before we even notice it exists. We thought we were looking at words pure and simple and did not notice that they are printed in a specific typeface.

When we do something in a default style acquired unconsciously, we do not notice the style of our activity. In such cases, we have an abstract concept of action that leaves style out of account. We can have a concept of lying without being aware — as a good investigative reporter is — that, in practice, we must have a style of lying. We can have a concept of quarreling without being aware — as a good marriage counselor is — that, in practice, we must have a style of quarreling.

Despite a lifetime of speaking, we can remain unaware of having a style of speaking. Yankees in Maine or Good ol' Boys in Louisiana think that people from Brooklyn talk funny. WASPS in the Chicago suburbs think that Poles or Lithuanians in Chicago speak English with an accent, as if the suburban WASPS, the Yankees, and the Good ol' Boys speak just plain American English with no accent. Coastal Californians think — just as the ancient Greeks did — that everybody else sounds barbarous. A moment's reflection will convince anyone that it is impossible to speak without an accent. But people who feel they set the local tone do not consider their own accents to be accents. It is hard to think of a child who is just learning to speak wanting to learn a style of speaking. The style is folded into the activity as it is learned: we think that we have learned to speak a language, not that we have learned a regional dialect. Children in Maine do not think they are learning to speak English with a Yankee accent; they think they are learning to speak English.

Although there are certainly a lot of English accents to be heard, even if we restrict the field to America, only a few people consciously choose theirs. Professional broadcasters, of course, do; sometimes people interested in acting careers do. Many politicians with degrees from prestigious universities have learned to speak with one accent in the capitals where they make laws and policy and quite a different one back home where they campaign for office. Senator Fulbright was a Rhodes scholar with an Oxford education. Before he went to the Senate, he had been the dean of a law school and the president of a university. His background was perfectly congruent with what he sounded like in action as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee conducting hearings on the Vietnam War, but when he campaigned in rural Arkansas, where he got his votes, there was no hint of Oxford, or even Fayetteville. On the stump, he sounded completely down home. After the election, that sound dissipated with every mile he got closer to Washington until he was sworn in for a new term and reassumed both the seat of power and the music of policy.

Senator Fulbright could maintain two dramatically distinct styles of speech in his personal repertory because he was aware of both as styles and consequently did not mistake either of them for just plain English. His awareness of his own styles allowed him to switch back and forth between them and fit them to circumstances. Everyone does this to some extent, but not everyone is aware of doing so. Speakers who are not consciously aware of their styles run into problems when none of their habitual styles fits a particular circumstance very well. We are trapped by our unconscious styles if we cannot recognize them as styles. When all of our styles are effectively default styles, we choose without knowing we are choosing and so cannot recognize the practical possibility of alternative styles.

People who unconsciously have acquired a full complement of routine conversational styles can deliberately and consciously add a new style of conversation to their collection, a style invented for new purposes and situations, once they have an operating concept of style. A novice receptionist at the headquarters of a large corporation consciously acquires the standard impersonal business style of conversation. The receptionist already possesses an underlying competence in conversation; he consciously acquires a new style meant for a special and unusually well-defined purpose.

Because writing is an activity, it too must be done in a style. But the domain of writing, like the domain of conversation, is enormous, not limited by just a handful of occasions or purposes. Consequently, there are many styles of writing. Common wisdom to the contrary, no one can master writing because writing is too large to be encompassed. It is not one skill; it is not even a small bundle of routine skills. A single style of writing invented for particular purposes, however, can be like a receptionist's conversation, something small enough to be walked around. It is possible to see where it begins and where it ends, what its purposes and occasions are, and how it selects its themes. These styles of writing can be acquired consciously as styles. Classic style is one of them.

Although nearly anybody who can read a newspaper can write, the styles we acquired unconsciously do not always serve our needs. Most of us have no unconscious writing style available to use when, after becoming engaged in a problem, we have thought it through, reached confident conclusions, and want to make our thought accessible to a permanent but unspecified audience. Even the best-educated members of our society commonly lack a routine style for presenting the result of their own engagement with a problem to people outside their own profession. Writers with a need to address such readers invented classic style. It is not a routine style in our culture, and unlike most of the writing styles we acquire, it is unlikely to be picked up without deliberate effort.

Classic style was not invented by one person or even by a small group working together. It was not invented just once, nor is it specific to one culture or one language. It was used with notable skill and effect by some of the outstanding French writers of the seventeenth century, and their achievements have left an echo in French culture that has no direct English or American equivalent. The seventeenth-century French masters of classic style, for one reason or another, conceived of themselves as addressing an intelligent but nonspecialist reader. They were all writers who had no doubt about the general importance of what they had to say. They shared the idea that truth about something is, in some sense, truth about everything, and they adopted the view that it is always possible to present a really significant conclusion to a general audience.

Classic style is focused and assured. Its virtues are clarity and simplicity; in a sense, so are its vices. It declines to acknowledge ambiguities, unessential qualifications, doubts, or other styles. It declines to acknowledge that it is a style. It makes its hard choices silently and out of the reader's sight. Once made, those hard choices are not acknowledged to be choices at all; they are presented as if they were inevitable because classic style is, above all, a style of presentation with claims to transparency.

To write without a chosen and consistent style is to write without a tacit concept of what writing can do, what its limits are, who its audience is, and what the writer's goals are. In the absence of settled decisions about these things, writing can be torture. While there is no single correct view of these matters, every well-defined style must take a stand on them. Classic style is neither shy nor ambiguous about fundamentals. The style rests on the assumptions that it is possible to think disinterestedly, to know the results of disinterested thought, and to present them without fundamental distortion. In this view, thought precedes writing. All of these assumptions may be wrong, but they help to define a style whose usefulness is manifest.

The attitudes that define classic style — the attitudes that define any style — are a set of enabling conventions. Some of the originators of classic style may have believed its enabling conventions — such as that truth can be known — but writing in this style requires no commitment to a set of beliefs, only a willingness to adopt a role for a limited time and a specific purpose.

The role is severely limited because classic prose is pure, fearless, cool, and relentless. It asks no quarter and gives no quarter to anyone, including the writer. While the role can be necessary, true, and useful, as well as wonderfully thrilling, it can hardly be permanent. For better or worse, human beings are not pure, fearless, cool, or relentless, even if we may find it convenient for certain purposes to pretend that we are. The human condition does not, in general, allow the degree of autonomy and certainty that the classic writer pretends to have. It does not sustain the classic writer's claim to disinterested expression of unconditional truth. It does not allow the writer indefinitely to maintain the posture required by classic style. But classic style simply does not acknowledge the human condition. The insouciance required to ignore what everyone knows and to carry the reader along in this style cannot be maintained very long, and the masters of the style always know its limits. The classic distance is a sprint.

0101 风格与古典风格

1.1 风格的概念

「风格」是每个人都会用的词，但几乎没人可以解释它的含义。「风格」与「内容」是一组词，但「风格」通常被认为不必要，甚至略带贬义。这组词使用灵活，但在多数用法中，风格是次要的一项，而且美国传统习语一直暗含这样的意思：没有风格我们会更好。往好说，风格可以装点门面，虽无必要但也无害；往坏说，这只是弄虚作假的委婉表达。过去有一家雪茄公司的标语就是「只要质量，无须风格」（AⅡ Quality, No Style.）。

即使人们欣赏风格，但风格被当作内容的对立面时，看起来只是一条可选的附加项。按照这种说法，内容上的思想和意义是先于风格产生的，且两者完全独立。也就是说，同样的思想或同样的意义可以用多种风格表达 —— 甚至什么风格都不用，我们可以选择某种风格来修饰，也可以直白坦率地、不加修饰地陈述。这样看，风格只是一种妨碍我们看到事物本来面目的装饰物；它好比给真相涂上一层清漆，至少看得不那么清晰了。

风格与内容完全独立，所以内容可以「直接」表达出来，这不是雪茄公司广告标语独有的理念，诗人威廉·巴特勒·叶芝在描述萧伯纳的作品时也持有同样的观点，不同的是，叶芝认为风格很重要，没有风格的作品即便存在，也是极其机械的东西。显然，叶芝把自己作品中独特的诗意音韵看作「风格」。它是一种迷人的音韵，吸引众多雄心勃勃的诗人竞相模仿，结果反倒毁了这些诗人的名声。在叶芝看来，萧伯纳的音韵毫无诗意可言，所以他认为萧伯纳是一位「没有风格」的作家。因为秉持风格可以选择这种观点，叶芝认为萧伯纳是「现代文学中最可怕的人」1，文章「影响深远」，但又觉得萧伯纳写的东西「没有音乐，没有风格，说不上好也说不上坏」。叶芝将萧伯纳描述为一台噩梦般的缝纫机，咔嗒咔嗒，闪耀着，微笑着，「永不消逝的微笑」。

无论风格是一种精神追求，还是徒有其表、华而不实，或两者兼而有之，凡是认为风格是可以选择的，不光写不好文章，也做不好任何其他事。没有哪一件事可以不用任何风格「简单」地做，因为风格是行为本身含有的，不是附加其上的。就这点而言，风格就像文本的字体。我们可能会忽略它，也确实经常忽略，但它一直在那里。我们通常注意不到无意识使用的风格，习以为常的行为好像什么风格也没有，但有经验的人很容易看到这些风格。印刷工、校对员或字体设计师不会注意不到文本的字体，但对于大多数人来说，要把那种字体和截然不同的字体放在一起才会看出差别。我们以为看的是纯粹简单的文字，没有注意到它们用了某种特定的字体。

我们做事自带某种无意识学到的风格时，不会注意到自己的行事风格。这个时候我们对行为只有抽象的概念，不会考虑到风格。我们有撒谎的概念，但不会像一位称职的调查记者一样，意识到我们实际上肯定会用某种撒谎风格：我们有争吵的概念，但不会像一位称职的婚烟顾向一样，意识到我们实际上肯定会用某种争吵风格。

尽管我们一生都在说话，但可能一直都未意识到我们有一种说话风格。美国缅因州的洋基人或路易斯安那州的南方乡村白人，觉得布鲁克林的人说话很好玩。芝加哥郊区的盎格鲁-撒克逊白人清教徒认为芝加哥的波兰人或立陶宛人说英语有口音，好像郊区的盎格鲁-撒克白人清教徒、洋基人和南方乡村白人说的是无口音的纯正美国英语一样。沿海的加州人认为 —— 就和古希腊人认为的那样 —— 所有其他人说的话听起来都很野蛮。细想一下就会明白，说话不可能没口音。但那些自认为说着本土正宗腔调的人，不会把自己的口音当口音。很难想象一个牙牙学语的孩子，会想着学习某种说话风格。学语言自然会学它自带的风格：我们自以为学了一门语言，而不是学了某个地区的方言。缅因州的孩子不会觉得他们学的是带洋基人口音的英语，他们觉得他们学的就是英语。

我们一定听过很多不同的英语口音，尽管只考虑美国这一个国家，也只有少数人会有意识地选择说话的口音。职业播音员当然会用口音；有时候对演艺事业感兴趣的人也会用口音。许多毕业于名牌大学的政治家会在不同场合用不同口音，比如在制定法律和政策的首都说一种口音，回家乡竞选公职时用完全不同的口音。参议员富布菜特是一名罗德学者，有牛津大学教育背景。去参议院之前，他曾担任法学院院长和大学校长。作为参议院外交关系委员会主席，他举行越战听证会时说话的口音完全符合他的背景；但当他在阿肯色州乡村竞选赢取选票时，听不出来一点牛津口音，甚至连费耶特维尔乡音都没有。做巡回演说时，他听起来是土生土长的本地人。选举结束回华盛顿的路上，离华盛顿越近，那种口音就越弱，直到他宣誓连任重新执掌政权时，操一口政客腔。

参议员富布赖特在巡演时能保持两种截然不同的演说风格，因为他知道两种演说都有各自的风格，所以不会把其中一种误当作纯正英语。知道自己使用的风格，他就能自如切换风格以适应不同场合。在某种程度上，每个人都会这样做，但并不是每个人都能意识到这点。那些不会特意注意自己说话风格的人，碰到某个场合不适用默认风格时，就会遇到问题。如果我们认不出自己的风格，就会困在自己的无意识风格中。当我们使用的风格实际上全都是默认风格时，我们做了选择却不自知，也就不知道可以选用更合适的风格。

无意识中掌握了整套日常会话风格的人，如果有运用风格的概念，可以为新的目的和情境再特意学一种会话风格。一位刚入职某家大公司总部的接待员，特意学会了不带个人情感色彩的标准商务会话风格。该接待员已经具备一种潜在的会话能力；为某个具体的特别目的，他特意学了一种新风格。

写作是一项活动，必然也是带着某种风格的。但是，写作和对话一样，范畴很广，不限于个别几种场合或目的。因此写作风格有很多种。和人们通常认为的不一样，没有人能掌握写作，因为写作的范围广到难以涵盖。它不是某一项技巧，也不是某几项技巧的组合。但我们很容易学会专为某种特定目的发明的写作风格，就像接待员学习会话一样。我们能看出它从哪里开始，到哪里结束，目的是什么，场景是什么，怎么选择主题。可以通过专门的学习学会这些写作风格。古典风格是这些风格中的一种。

一个人只要会阅读，基本上就会写作，但我们无意识学会的风格有些时候并不顶用。当我们在某个问题上冥思苦想得出自信的结论，想向一群固定的读者表达我们的想法，但又不知道这些读者是谁时，我们大多数人无意识学会的风格都用不上。即使是我们这个社会上学识最好的人，也很难用自己惯用的风格向外行人说明他们在某个问题上的研究成果。一些需要面向这类读者的作家发明了古典风格。它不是我们文化中的惯用风格，也不像我们大多数人学到的写作风格，它需要刻意去学才能学会。

古典风格不是某个人或某个一起工作的小团体发明出来的。它不是一次就发明出来的，也不是专为某种文化或某种语言发明出来的。古典风格被十七世纪杰出的法国作家运用得出神入化，他们的成就在法国文化中留下了英美文化不曾出现的回响。十七世纪法国的古典风格大师，因为某些原因，把自己的读者定位为聪明的外行人。他们是一群自信的作家，认定自己的话对每个读者都很重要。他们认同 —— 从某种意义上来说 —— 某件事的真相可以是所有事的真相，他们相信始终有可能向广大读者呈现真正重要的结论。

古典风格是明确的、肯定的。它的优点是清晰简单，但从某种意义上来说，这也是它的缺点。古典风格不接受模糊的表述、不必要的附加条件、支支吾吾或其他做派。它拒不承认它是一种风格。它暗自做出困难的选择，不让读者察觉。一旦决定，这些困难的选择压根不被看成是选择；它们的呈现好像非此不可一样，因为古典风格的首要特点是透明、无痕的呈现型风格。

没有确定一致风格的写作，自然不会考虑到写作能做什么，它的局限在哪，它的读者是谁，作者的目标是什么。若不对这些问题做出确切的选择，写作会很痛苦。虽然这些问题的观点不是唯一的，但每一种明确的风格必须采取一种立场。古典风格对基本问题既不会回避，也不会模棱两可。古典风格依存的假设是，人可以客观地思考，能知道客观思考的结果，呈现出来也不会有所偏倚。从这点来看，思想形成于写作之前。所有这些假设可能是错的，但它们可以帮助确立一种风格，这种风格的作用也很明显。

那些决定古典风格的态度 —— 决定任何一种风格的态度 —— 由一组基础规约构成。最开始使用古典风格的一些人，可能一直都信奉它的基础规约 —— 比如真相可知 —— 但是用这种风格写作，不需要作者信奉一组信念，只要作者愿意出于某种特定目的在一定时间内扮演一种角色即可。

这种角色受到严格的约束，因为古典风格的文章纯粹、无畏、冷静、无情。它不寻求怜悯，也不怜悯任何人，包括作者本人。尽管这样的角色必要、真实、有用，也令人激动不已，但很难长久。不管是好是坏，人类做不到纯粹、无畏、冷静或无情，即使为了达到某些目的而假装成这样很方便。以人类的条件，通常无法让古典风格作者表现出他希望的那种自主和笃定，也无法满足古典风格作者客观表达无条件真相的要求。它无法让作者一直维持古典风格要求的姿态。但古典风格就是不承认人类的实际情况。它要求漠视人人知道的事情，把读者带入这种风格中，这种漠视无法维持很长时间，而古典风格大师总能把握它的局限。古典风格是一场限时冲刺短跑。

### 1.2 Recognizing Classic Style

Classic style never became the standard for English prose that it has been at various times for French. The most admired prose writers in English have never been as successful in creating any dominant style as the most admired French prose writers of the seventeenth century were in making classic style a cultural norm. The reasons are many and defy simple summary, but they probably include the existence of an exceptionally influential line of verse writers in English — a line with no French counterpart; the profound influence of the King James translation of the Bible on English prose style; the great diversity of styles among admired English prose writers; and the fact that English prose before the eighteenth century cannot serve as a direct model for later writing. Seventeenth-century English prose seems archaic to later English readers; seventeenth-century French prose is perfectly normal even to a contemporary French reader.

Certain classic French writers — Descartes, Pascal, the duc de La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Lafayette, the Cardinal de Retz, Madame de Sévigné, and La Bruyère — have been taken as models of French prose practically from their day to ours. Indeed, for many, their French is French. Those who admire it rarely fail to single out for praise its clarity, suppleness, and elegance.

Propagandists, in the course of promoting the use of French as an international diplomatic language, attributed these marks of style to something inherent in the French language. Antoine Rivarol is the author of the best-known version of this primitive excursion into salesmanship as essentialist linguistics. Language, Professor Rivarol observes, is clear when it follows the order of reason, and unclear when it follows the movements and order of our experience. But, behold, French has a unique privilege among languages: its natural order is the order of reason. It is, therefore, necessarily clear where Greek, Latin, Italian, and English are not. In the absence of the uniquely French syntax of reason, writing in other languages is heir to all the fog and filthy air that passion and sensation impart. Rivarol won a prize for a disquisition based on these observations in the eighteenth century; today both his argument and his conclusion sound like a parody of alchemy. In the age of Derrida and Lacan, French prose has triumphantly displayed its capacity to be as incomprehensible, elephantine, and turgid as double-Dutch.

The almost transparent silliness of attributing marks of style to the inherent qualities of particular languages has not discouraged the practice even among accomplished writers who ought to know better. T. S. Eliot, in observing that English writers at no time looked to a common standard, attributes this fact to what he takes to be an inherent characteristic of the language.「The English language,」he pronounces,「is one which offers a wide scope for legitimate divergences of style; it seems to be such that no one age, and certainly no one writer, can establish a norm.」

It seems superfluous to argue that classic style does not issue from French or from any other language as such. All we have to do is look at its history. French classic style was invented by drawing together and refining attitudes and practices found in antiquity among writers of Greek and Latin, and the invaluable instrument that resulted has long been employed by classic stylists in English, although no English philosopher with the cultural standing of Descartes consistently employs it, nor was there ever such a remarkable group of classic writers in English at any one time as there was in the French grand siècle.

Consider, as an example of classic style, the following passage from La Rochefoucauld:

Madame de Chevreuse had sparkling intelligence, ambition, and beauty in plenty; she was flirtatious, lively, bold, enterprising; she used all her charms to push her projects to success, and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way.

Mme de Chevreuse avait beaucoup d'esprit, d'ambition et de beauté; elle était galante, vive, hardie, entreprenante; elle se servait de tous ses charmes pour réussir dans ses desseins, et elle a presque toujours porté malheur aux personnes qu'elle y a engagées.

This passage displays truth according to an order that has nothing to do with the process by which the writer came to know it. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge. This pose implies that the writer has wide and textured experience; otherwise he would not be able to make such an observation. But none of that personal history, personal experience, or personal psychology enters into the expression. Instead the sentence crystallizes the writer's experience into a timeless and absolute sequence, as if it were a geometric proof. The sentence has a clear direction and a goal. It leads us to that goal, which coincides with its final phrase; it is constructed to telegraph its direction. We know that it will bring us to its goal, and stop cleanly when it has done so.

By contrast, consider the opening sentence of Samuel Johnson's「Preface to Shakespeare,」which is a master's recital piece, but is not classic:

That praises are without reason lavished on the dead, and that the honours due only to excellence are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time.

This sentence does not telegraph its structure from the opening. We must follow it through complex and unexpected paths. In La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence, the last section is the conclusion of all that has gone before it; the beginning of the sentence exists for the end, and the sentence is constructed so that we can anticipate arriving at such a conclusion. In Johnson's sentence, by contrast, the final phrase,「flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time,」is not a conclusion upon which the rest of the sentence depends. It might have come in the middle of the sentence. The end of the sentence might have been「be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox.」This does not make the sentence inadequate in any way, but it is characteristically unclassic. The classic sentence, once written, seems to have been inevitable.

La Rochefoucauld's sentence was of course difficult to write, but it looks easy. The writer hides all the effort. Johnson's sentence was clearly difficult to write, and its writer wants to display it as if it were a trophy won through his personal effort.

La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence pretends that it could be said. It would take a true master of speech to construct such a sentence spontaneously. In fact we sense that the rhythm is too perfect to be spontaneous. Still, it sounds like ideally efficient and precise speech. If angels spoke French, it would sound like this. Johnson's sentence, by contrast, can only be writing that took effort. In its rhythms, we do not hear someone speaking spontaneously. One could memorize it and repeat it in speech, but even then it would sound like memorized writing, not like speech. In the theology behind Johnson's sentence, writing is hard and noble, because truth is the reward of effort and cannot be captured in spontaneous speech. In the theology behind La Rochefoucauld's sentence, writing should look easy even as it looks masterful. Truth is a grace that flees from earnest effort. The language of truth is ideally graceful speech.

La Rochefoucauld's sentence is a prototype of classic style. The conceptual and linguistic environment associated with classic style is extremely rich and complex. No classic text — not even a prototype — incorporates all of it. Any list of criteria would be misconceived: some texts lack central attributes of classic style and yet are obviously classic; other texts are faintly classic throughout; still others have isolated parts that are strongly classic; some texts incorporate only a few elements of classic style; some clearly unclassic texts contain marks of classic style; some texts have the verbal marks of classic style but none of its theology; some texts lie between classic style and another style.

Consider the gradient between plain style and classic style.「The truth is pure and simple」is plain style.「The truth is rarely pure, and never simple」is classic style. The plain version contains many elements of classic style without being classic; the classic version contains all of the plain version without being plain.

The concept of classic style assumes that plain style already exists. The classic version introduces a refinement, a qualification, a meditation on the plain version that makes it classic. Classic style takes the attitude that it is superior to plain style because classic style presents intelligence as it should be presented: as a sparkling display, not weighed down by grinding earnestness. The classic writer wants to be distinguished from others because she assumes that truth, though potentially available to all, is not the common property of common people, and that it is not to be perceived or expressed through common means unrefined. The classic writer sees common sense as only an approximation which, left untested and unrefined, can turn out to be false. The plain writer wants to be common because she assumes that truth is the common property of common people, directly perceived and expressed through common means. For the plain writer, common sense is truth. Unlike plain style, classic style is aristocratic, which is not to say artificially restricted, since anyone can become an aristocrat by learning classic style. Anyone who wants to can attain classic style, but classic style views itself as an intellectual achievement, not a natural endowment.

There are many features of classic style besides a simple and elegant shape and the introduction of some refinement in the thought. Behind these features is a complicated, polished, and fascinating view of truth and language, writers and readers. The rest of this essay is an attempt to lay out the features of classic style and their underlying conceptual stand.

1.2 辨识古典风格

古典风格从来不是英语散文的典范，但曾在不同的时代被尊为法语散文的典范。十七世纪最负盛名的法语散文作家把古典风格推为一种文化规范，历代才华出众的英语散文作家在创造任何一种主流风格上从未取得如此成就。其原因有很多，并非三言两语可以概括，但很可能有以下几个原因：1）历史上有一大批影响深远的英语诗歌创作者，其数量之多非法语作家能比拟；2）钦定版圣经（KJV）对英语散文风格产生了深刻影响；3）杰出的英语散文作家创造了非常多元化的写作风格；4）十八世纪以前的英语散文很难成为后世直接模仿的典范。十七世纪的英语散文对后来的英文读者来说似乎过时了，而十七世纪的法语散文甚至在当代法语读者看来也极为日常。

一些古典风格法语作家 —— 笛卡儿（Descartes）、帕斯卡（Pascal）、弗朗索瓦·德·拉罗什福科（the duc de La Rochefoucauld）、拉法耶特夫人（Madame de Lafayette）、莱兹（the Cardinal de Retz）、塞维涅夫人（Madame de Sevigne）及拉布吕耶尔（La Bruyere）—— 几乎自他们的时代起直至今天，一直都是法语散文作家的模范。事实上，对多数人而言，他们的法语才是真正的法语。欣赏法语散文的人，说起它的优点很少不提到它清晰、灵活与优雅的特点。

法语宣扬者在推行法语作为国际外交用语时，把这些风格特征归于法语固有的一些东西。安托万·里瓦罗尔（Antoine de Rivarol）2 是早期本质主义语言学著作写得最好的作者。里瓦罗尔观察到，语言遵循推理顺序时很清晰，遵循我们体验的活动及顺序时则不清晰。但要注意的是，在众多语言中，法语有一个独特的优势，即它固有的顺序正好就是推理顺序。因此，那些希腊语、拉丁语、意大利语和英语说不明白的地方，用法语就能讲明白。因为其他语言没有法语特有的推理句法，写出来的文章承袭的是激情和感受散发出来的所有迷雾和浊气。十八世纪，里瓦罗尔根据这些观察结果写过专题论述，还获得了表彰。今天看来，他的论证过程及结论，听起来像模仿拙劣的炼金术。德里达（Derrida）及拉康（Lacan）的时代，写出来的法语文章如「天书」一般晦涩难懂、臃肿乏味。

2『第一次知道法语的一个特点：其固有的顺序正好是推理顺序。做一张任意卡片。（2022-03-05）』—— 已完成

即使是才华横溢的作家也未能幸免，他们本应见多识广，却也犯下这般显而易见的错误，认为风格特征是特定语言固有的优势。TS. 艾略特 (TS. Eio）注意到英语作家从不参照共同标准，但他把这个事实归咎于所谓的英语固有特征。他说：「英语语言，为合理多样化的风格提供了广阔的空间，似乎没有哪一段时期，当然也没有哪一位作家，能建立某种范式。」3

古典风格并非发源于法语或任何其他语言，说这话似乎有些多余。

我们回看古典风格的历史就知道了。古典风格源自对古代希腊语作家和拉丁语作家的态度及实践的总结提炼，英语古典风格作家长期以来一直受用于这种宝贵经验，只是说没有哪位资深的英语哲学家像笛卡儿那样一以贯之地使用这种风格，也没有哪个时期像法国「大世纪」时期一样涌现出一批杰出的英语古典风格作家。

我们举一段拉罗什福科的话作为古典风格的例子：

选段 1-1

谢弗勒兹夫人光芒四射，集智慧、抱负和美丽于一身；她风情万千、活泼大胆、勇于开拓：她动用她全部的魅力，争取把事情办成功，在这过程中她几乎总是给那些她碰到的人带来灾难。4

这段话展示真相的顺序和作者实际认识真相的过程无关。作者是以一种全知的姿态，这种姿态暗示作者有细致入微的丰富体验，不然他无法做出这样的观察。但他的表达没有混杂任何个人历史、个人经历或个人心理。相反，这句话将作者的经历凝结成一组永恒且绝对的序列，就像这种经历是一个几何证明题。这个句子有清晰的方向和目标。它把我们引向那个目标，与它末尾的短语交汇；句子组织起来是为了指明它的方向。我们知道它会把我们引向它的目标，一旦做到即刻终止。

我们再看看一个对比的例子，出自塞缪尔·约翰逊（Samuel Johnson）《莎士比亚戏剧集序言》（Preface to Shakespeare）的开头几句，这是大师的独奏曲，但不是古典风格：

我们可能永远听到有人抱怨说我们对于死人妄加赞扬，说我们对古人怀着他们不应得到的尊敬，这种尊敬只有真正优秀的作家才配享受。什么人常说这样的抱怨话呢？他们可能是这样一种人：虽然他们的话不能算是真理，他们却想靠着发表似是而非的谬论而出名：他们也可能是另一类的人：这些人由于不得志而不得不设法安慰自己，因此希望他们在当代所不能获得的名誉地位，后代的人会送给他们，因此他们妄想他们由于妒忌而受不到重视，最后时间会给他们带来人们对他们的重视。5

我们无法从这句话的开头看出它的结构。要理解它，我们必须穿过复杂难料的小径。在拉罗什福科的古典句子中，最后部分是前面所有内容的总结，句子开头是为了结尾而存在，句子组织起来就是让我们能够预料这样的结论。相反，在约翰逊的句子中，最后一句「因此他们妄想他们由于妒忌而受不到重视，最后时间会给他们带来人们对他们的重视」，并不是句子前面部分依存的结论。它可能应该出现在句子中间。用作结尾的句子可能是「虽然他们的话不能算是真理，他们却想靠着发表似是而非的谬论而出名」。不是说这样的句子不完整，但它显然不是古典的。古典句子一旦写出来，似乎就非此不可了。

拉罗什福科的句子当然不好写，但看起来简单。作者隐藏了所有努力。约翰逊的句子显然也很难写，但它的作者将这种困难展现出来，好像举着认可个人努力的奖杯一样。

拉罗什福科的古典句子可以当作口头说出来的。只有真正的演讲大家才能即兴造出这样的句子。事实上我们感觉到，节奏如此完美的句子不可能随口说出。但它听起来是完美精炼的。如果天使说法语，听起来大概就是这样。相比之下，约翰逊的句子只能是费脑筋的写作。从它的节奏，我们听不出是某人的即兴发言。人们可以先记住这句话，然后口头上复述出来，就算这样，听着还是像背诵书面文字，而不像讲话。约翰逊的句子背后的观念是，写作是一件既困难又崇高的事情，因为真相是作者煞费苦心获得的奖励，无法在即兴发言中捕捉到。而拉罗什福科的句子背后的观念是，即使写得精彩，也应该看起来简单。真相是苦心经营后仅存的一丝优雅。表达真相的语言是完美优雅的。

拉罗什福科的句子是古典风格的典范之作。与古典风格相关的概念环境和语言环境纷繁复杂。没有一篇古典文本能涵盖全部要素，典范之作也做不到。列出任何一条标准都无法全面涵盖：有些文本虽不具备古典风格的核心特征但显然是古典风格；另一些文本通篇没有明显的古典风格痕迹；有些文本的个别片段是明显的古典风格；有些文本只包含古典风格的少许要素；有些明显不是古典风格的文本却具备古典风格的特征；有些文本的语言特征是古典风格，背后的观念跟古典风格一点关系都没有；有些文本介于古典风格和其他风格之间。

看看平实风格和古典风格之间的过渡界限。「真相纯粹且简单」（The truth is pure and simple）是平实风格。「真相很少纯粹，也绝不简单」6（The truth is rarely pure, and never simple）是古典风格。平实风格的句子包含许多古典风格元素，却不是古典风格；古典风格的句子包含平实风格的全部元素，却不是平实风格。

古典风格认定平实风格是前提条件。平实风格的句子经过提炼、限定和琢磨，可以变成古典风格。古典风格的态度是它优于平实风格，因为古典风格以展示智慧的方式展示智慧：机智风趣地闪现，而非束手束脚地一本正经。古典风格作者想区别于他人，因为他认为尽管人人都可能知道真相，但真相不是普通大众共同享有的财富，也无法通过不经提炼的一般方式观察或表达。古典风格作者认为常识只是一种粗略认识，这种认识未经检验和提炼，可能是错的。平实风格作者希望大众化，因为他认为真相是大众的共同财富，可以用一般方式直接观察和表达。对平实风格作者来说，常识就是真相。与平实风格不同，古典风格是贵族风格，这不是说要人为限制，因为任何人都可以通过学习古典风格成为贵族的一员。只要想学，任何人都能学会古典风格，但古典风格本身是一种脑力成果，而不是一种天赋异禀。

2『这一节开始设计本书的核心概念「古典风格」了，古典风格做一张主题卡片。（2022-03-05）』—— 已完成

除了句子简单优雅、思想精炼，古典风格还有很多其他特征。这些特征源自对真相和语言、作者和读者的立场，这种立场复杂、优雅又迷人。在本篇，我们会尝试阐明古典风格的特征及其隐含的概念立场。

### 1.3 The Elements of Style

Elementary does not always mean easy. It often means fundamental. Euclid's mathematical classic is called The Elements of Geometry. If we ask what Euclid means by「elements,」we will discover that they consist of a short list of twenty-three definitions, such as「a line is breadthless length,」five postulates, such as「all right angles are equal to one another,」and five common notions, such as「if equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.」From these elements, all of Euclid's geometry follows. For a mathematical genius like Sir Isaac Newton, the book is really over once these elements are laid out, since everything else is implicit within them. The Elements of Geometry, the most successful textbook in history, establishes a set of expectations for other textbooks that present the structure of a field. So, when we look into a book called The Elements of Accounting or The Elements of Boatbuilding or the elements of anything — every field has at least half a dozen books with such a title — we expect what we find in Euclid: a small number of starting points at a high level of generality from which all the details of the subject follow.

In the eighteenth century, when chemistry was separated from alchemy, the field came to be structured around the concept of chemical elements, only a handful of which were known. Chemical elements, like Euclid's elements, are the fundamental starting points of their domain; unlike Euclid's elements, they are also elemental in constituting everything more complex. The origin of this concept of chemical elements is often attributed to Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794), whose presentation in Traité élémentaire de chemie, presenté dans un ordre nouveau et d'après les découvertes modernes (1789) was embraced by almost everyone who read it, partly because he wrote in classic style; other books on the subject were written in styles too complicated to be widely understood.

The concept of chemical elements is similar to Euclid's concept of elements, inasmuch as everything in the domain of chemistry can be said to be implicit in them. Even today, when there are 118 elements instead of the handful known to Lavoisier, it is possible to put them all on a chart inside the cover of a chemistry textbook or on the wall of a classroom. The concept that all matter is a combination of elements is fundamental to the science of chemistry; but some of these elements are less central as constituents than others. Oxygen, for example, is central; unnamed elements that are known to exist but have not been isolated experimentally are peripheral. The physical world, unlike geometry, is not invented. There are a multitude of geometries that derive from a multitude of starting points. There is only one physical world, whose starting point is not a human invention. So while the concept「elemental atom」is fundamental and distinct, the actual table of these elements has slightly fuzzy margins. New elements have been added or created within the past fifty years, but they are all exotic and have little to do with our understanding of the fundamental nature of the chemical world.

The periodic table of chemical elements is implicitly modeled on the alphabet. The chemical elements are a kind of alphabet of the physical world. The Roman alphabet, used to write English and most European languages, is itself a set of elements. With just twenty-six letters, we can write every word in these languages, even words that are obsolete, even tomorrow's words that have not yet been coined. When the letters of this alphabet are arranged on a typewriter keyboard, we can see that while they are not all equally important — we would miss the z if it were broken a lot less than the e — they exist like Euclid's axioms on the same level of generality; they are all fundamental: no one of them derives from any other. When the original typewriter keyboard became the more complex computer keyboard, it was expanded. It added exotic function keys, all of which are convenient, none of which is elementary in the sense that the letters of the alphabet are elementary. The computer keyboard, like the table of chemical elements, acknowledges in its spatial layout the marginal nature of the exotic additions.

Elements in all of these cases are definite and few and are the starting points of everything in their domain. We should expect the same limits to apply to the elements of prose style. These elements cannot be an indefinite and miscellaneous list of surface features and mechanical rules. The authors of this book think the elements of style legitimately can be expressed as a short series of questions concerning a set of relationships among truth, presentation, writer, reader, thought, and language. These questions are addressed to fundamental issues that must be answered deliberately or by default before we can write at all. The issues are all on the same fundamental level. None concerns a surface phenomenon — like sentence length — and however closely related they are, none derives from another.

These questions concern a series of relationships: What can be known? What can be put into words? What is the relationship between thought and language? Who is the writer addressing and why? What is the implied relationship between writer and reader? What are the implied conditions of discourse? In any given style, positions will be assigned to truth, language, the writer, and the reader. Classic style is a group of closely related decisions. It defines roles and creates a distinctive network of relationships; it takes a consistent stand on the elements of style. Other stands constitute other styles.

The concept that a style follows from a set of fundamental decisions is commonplace in musicology and art history. For example, when Charles Rosen describes the origins of the classical style in music, he begins by describing what he calls「needs」that the existing high baroque style was incapable of meeting. In Rosen's analysis, high baroque style was invented to present static states: it rendered sentiment or a theatrical moment of crisis. Classical style was invented to present dynamic action. Handel, a master of high baroque style, juxtaposed different emotions. Mozart, a master of classical style, represents a single character passing from one emotion to another in a sequence. In Rosen's formula,「Dramatic sentiment was replaced by dramatic action.」Classical style differs from the style of the high baroque because it has made different decisions about the object of presentation. Although it is possible to catalogue surface differences between high baroque style and classical style, the motive and character of the change cannot be understood as a replacement of one set of surface features by another. For Rosen, the first significant examples of the capacity of the classical style to represent dramatic sequence are to be found in the harpsichord sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti. Scarlatti made classical decisions about fundamental questions although he lacked many of the surface features of the style:「the changes of texture in his sonatas are the dramatic events, clearly set off and outlined, that were to become central to the style of the generations that came after him.」「Although there is little sign in his works of the classical technique of transition from one kind of rhythm to another, there is already an attempt to make a real dramatic clash in the changes of key. . . .」

In art history as well, there is normally an awareness that style follows from fundamental decisions rather than surface features. Émile Mâle, in his analysis of the iconographic sources of religious art in Western Europe, for example, notes that theologians of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries share a conception of the world as a「vast symbol.」But while this theological concept of the world as an integrated symbolic form is the source of the stylistic decisions of the thirteenth century, it has no such role in the style of religious art of the fifteenth century. In Mâle's words,「A profound symbolism had governed the arrangement of the sculptured figures on the portals of . . . thirteenth-century churches,」so that「the statues of Chartres formed a perfectly coherent system of ideas.」

By contrast, the fifteenth-century façade of Saint-Vulfran at Abbéville, which Mâle describes as magnificent and compares for its beauty and the richness of its decoration to the great achievements of the thirteenth century, is stylistically a world away from the thirteenth-century conception of a church as a learned encyclopedia. The style of the sculptural program of Saint-Vulfran is not informed by any such governing plan because, in common with the other great achievements in religious art of its century, it does not derive from a symbolic conception of the universe. The symbolism of the thirteenth century that was the foundation of a style of iconography has yielded to a less learned, less literary style of iconography in the fifteenth. Sentiment and emotion have replaced symbol and encyclopedic organization.

The thesis that a style follows from a set of fundamental decisions and not from a catalogue of surface features is far less common in books about style in writing. Almost every book about writing contains the word「style」in its title or as a significant section heading, and many magazines and journals include a style sheet defining their house style. Let us consider a selection of these: The Chicago Manual of Style, the MLA Style Manual, the final section (「Style」) of The Harvest Reader, chapter 6 (「Style」) of Kate Turabian's Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, and Joseph M. Williams's summary of his collaboration with Gregory Colomb, Style: Toward Clarity and Grace.

The word「style」does not mean the same thing to the writers of these guides, textbooks, and manuals. In The Chicago Manual of Style,「style」refers to those arbitrary decisions that must be made for consistency's sake in copy text, but have no consequence for intellectual content or conceptual organization. For example, with respect to intellectual content or conceptual organization, it makes no difference how a date is written — 「March 24, 1954」or「24 March 1954」 — but it is desirable that dates be written in a consistent manner throughout a text, and The Chicago Manual of Style gives a standard, arbitrary way to achieve consistency.「Style」here means necessary but arbitrary decisions about surface features of copy text.

Joseph Williams's Style, by contrast, views surface features of copy text as peripheral to its project, which is to explain how to revise「pointed」prose so that it can be easily parsed.

Yet all six of our selections, which stand for an indefinite number of others, characterize「style」as something external to the core decisions that define style in the sense that Rosen and Mâle have discussed it.

The MLA Style Manual is just a shorter and arbitrarily different version of The Chicago Manual of Style. Kate Turabian offers rules — many of them「adapted from The Chicago Manual of Style, 13th edition」 — suitable for term papers. The final section (「Style」) in The Harvest Reader implies that style is a decorative element that comes after all the serious work has been completed, like paint on a house.

Even Strunk and White's famous textbook The Elements of Style — whose title might lead you to expect a writer's equivalent to Euclid's Elements of Geometry — treats style as composed of distinguishing surface marks. If you open Euclid's Elements to the first page, you see a few fundamental definitions and axioms. If you open Strunk and White's Elements to the first page, you see:

1 Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding's.

Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,

Charles's friend

Burns's poems

the witch's malice.

Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in -es and -is, the possessive Jesus', and such forms as for conscience' sake, for righteousness' sake.

If you look at chapter 5,「An Approach to Style,」where the authors propose to treat「style in its broader meaning,」you will find a discussion not of core decisions but rather of「what is distinguished and distinguishing」about the surface of language:「When we speak of Fitzgerald's style, . . . we mean the sound his words make on paper.」

In Strunk and White, all style is finally said to be a「high mystery」because it cannot be learned from a catalogue of the only elements of style that they consider, the surface elements.「Who knows why certain notes in music are capable of stirring the listener deeply, though the same notes slightly rearranged are impotent?」Charles Rosen, working from the core decisions that define a musical style, rather than from individual notes, sees an intelligible historical process instead of high mystery.

Joseph Williams's book, Style, is completely free of high mystery and intelligently suspicious of rules of usage. Even his final chapter,「Usage,」which treats basic rules, regards points of usage as peripheral to writing. Style is entirely invulnerable to any accusation that it offers a mechanical approach to writing since it is quite explicit that it is not a guide to writing at all but rather a guide to solving a problem in writing: if the writer has finished the intellectual work of writing and has written a draft, but finds that his text frustrates his reader's attempt to understand it, then Style will show the writer ways to change the structure of expression so as to accommodate the reader's routines. To this extent, Williams's approach to style is distinguished from that of everyone else on our list. His book is not meant as a guide to arbitrary conventions or matters of taste but rather as a model of how people read what Williams calls「pointed discourse」 — which includes arguments, instructions, memos, and so on. Knowing this model allows a writer to shape his discourse to fit the expectations of his readers. Williams's book is effective and helpful as a guide to higher mechanics. But it presents itself as concerned with revision — an activity independent of decisions on the fundamental questions of truth, language, reader, and writer. In this way, Williams inadvertently and inevitably presents himself as describing style, rather than a style. There is a consistent set of decisions on fundamental matters lying behind the style Williams treats, but he does not acknowledge them or acknowledge that there are alternatives.

For every item on our list that treats prose style, there is an assumption made at the beginning that is linked to a mistake that comes at the end. If you start off with the view of style as a list of surface mechanical elements at any level, then you can end up with the correct list and present it as constituting style, rather than a style.

In music and in painting, different fundamental decisions define different styles. In geometry or logic, different fundamental axioms define different systems. In writing, different stands on the elements of style define different families of prose styles. A failure to view style as a fundamental stand on central issues entails a failure to see the possibility of other stands that constitute other styles.

The domain of style is what can be chosen. A fundamental stand is a choice open to the writer. By contrast, to know a language is to know a great range of things that are not open to choice: it is not open to every writer, for example, to decide that sentences shall begin with a period and end with a capital letter, that the word「dog」shall refer to cats, that predicates shall not agree in number and person with their subjects, or that six fine brick houses shall be called「brick fine houses six.」You can, however, decide whether to call a certain dog a「dog」or a「hound,」to say「Sally devoured the roast beef」rather than「The roast beef was devoured by Sally,」to write in sentences that are short and clipped rather than baroque and periodic, or to write「24 March 1954」rather than「March 24, 1954,」but these are surface features. Books that talk about style in writing treat these moments of choice at the surface level but typically ignore the elements of style, which is to say, the fundamental choices from which surface features derive.

We propose to describe the fundamental questions that are the elements of style in writing, and the answers to these questions that define classic style. The elements come under five topical headings: truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language.

0201 风格要素与古典立场

1.3 风格的要素 ①

① 标题及正文中的「要素」与正文《几何原本》《会计学基础》中的「原本」和「基础」均对应同一个英文单词 Elements —— 译者注

基础（Elementary）并不总是意味着简单。它常有不可或缺之意。欧几里得的数学经典被称为《几何原本》（The Elements of Geometry），如果我们问欧几里得「原本」（elements）指什么，我们会发现，它们被列成二十三条定义（如「线只有长度而没有宽度」）、五大公设（如「凡是直角都相等」）和五大公理（如「等量加等量，其和相等」）。这些要素是欧几里得整个几何体系发展的基础。对于艾萨克·牛顿爵士这样的数学天才来说，这本书把这些要素逐一列出来也就结束了，因为所有其他含义都隐含其中。《几何原本》是历史上最成功的教科书，在阐述领域体系上为其他教科书树立了一组标杆。因此，当我们查看一本《会计学基础》（The Elements of Accounting）或《造船术基础》（The Elements of Boatbuilding）或任一领域基础的书时，我们想看的是欧几里得那样的书：从一小部分高度概括的基础定理延伸出科学的所有细节。

十八世纪，化学从炼金术中独立出来，开始围绕化学元素的概念构建体系，当时为人所知的化学元素只有很少一部分。化学元素，像欧几里得的几何要素，是所在领域的核心基点，不同的是，它们也是构成所有更复杂事物的基础。化学元素这个概念一般来说是安托万·拉瓦锡（Antoine Lavoiser, 1743-1794）的首创，读过他的《化学基础论》（Traitelementaire de chemie, presente dans un ordre noveau etdapresles decouvertes modernes,1789）的人几乎没有不喜欢的，部分原因是这本书的写作风格正是古典风格；该主题的其他书因写作风格太复杂，未能被广泛普及。

1-3『看到拉瓦锡以及他「化学基础论」好亲切，之前研读过，而且拉瓦锡（1743-1794）之前记录进牛人卡片里，而且知道他是法国大革命时被砍的头，因之前是个官员，拉格朗日为其惋惜。（2022-03-06）』

化学元素的概念可以类比欧几里得几何要素的概念，在化学学科中，一切事物都隐含在化学元素中。即使现在发现的 118 种化学元素远超过拉瓦锡当时知道的数量，也全都能收录在化学教材封面内侧或者教室墙上的元素周期表中。所有物质都由化学元素组合而成，这个概念是化学学科的基础；但是有些化学元素作为组成成分，不如其他元素重要。比如，氧元素很重要，但未命名的元素 —— 即使知道它们的存在 —— 因没有通过实验分离出来所以不那么重要。

跟几何体系不一样，自然世界不是发明出来的。根据几何的众多基点，该学科可以划分成不同分支。而自然世界只有一个，它的学科基点并非人类发明。因此，尽管「基础原子」这个概念很重要也很明晰，但这些元素实际所处的列表仍有些许模糊和空白。过去五十年新添加或新发明的元素，都是新异元素，与我们以识化学世界的基本性质没有太大关系。

化学元素周期表完全是模仿字母表。化学元素是物质世界的一种字母组合。作为英语及大部分欧洲语言的书写字母，罗马字母本身是一组元素。我们可以用二十六个字母写出这些语言的每个单词，甚至那些过时的单词，又甚至尚未造出来的新词。当把这些字母排列组合在打字机键盘上时，我们可以看到，虽然这些字母不是同等重要 —— E 键的缺失会比 Z 键的缺失更让人想念 —— 但它们像欧几里得定理一样普遍；它们都不可替代：没有哪个是从另一个派生而来的。当原先的打字机键盘变成更复杂的计算机键盘时，键盘也跟着扩增。它增加了新异功能键，它们都很方便，但不像字母表中的字母一样基础。计算机键盘与化学元素周期表一样，在空间布局上考虑了新异元素的边缘性质。

这些例子中的要素都很确定且数量不多，是各自领域一切事物的基点。文本风格的要素也应该具备类似条件。这些要素不可能是五花八门、模棱两可的表面特征和死板规则。笔者认为，风格要素可以表达为对一组关系提出的系列问题 —— 真相、呈现、作者、读者、思想和语言，以及它们两两之间的关系。这些基础问题在我们写作之前必须有意识或无意识地回答出来。这些问题都是同等基础的问题。没有哪个关注表面现象 —— 比如句子的长短 —— 也没有哪一个由另一个派生而来，不论相互关系多么紧密。

这些问题问的是一系列关系：什么是可知的？什么可以用言语表达？思想和语言的关系是什么？作者对话的读者是谁？为什么是他们？作者与读者之间的内在关系是什么？言语交流的隐含条件是什么？任何一种确定的风格，都会对真相、语言、作者及读者采取一种立场。古典风格是一组密切相关的决定。它确立了角色，而且创建出一种独特的关系网络；它对风格要素采取一致的立场。采取的立场不同，形成的风格也不同。

风格源于一组基本立场（Fundamental Decisions），这种概念在音乐学和艺术史上很常见。比如，查尔斯·罗森（Charles Rosen）说到古典风格音乐的起源时，首先讲的是当时巴洛克盛期风格无法满足的他称为「需求」的东西。罗森分析，巴洛克盛期风格是为了表现静止状态：表达情绪或某个戏剧性的危急时刻。古典风格是为了表现动态行为。巴洛克盛期风格大师亨德尔（Handel）会同时表现不同的情绪。古典风格大师莫扎特表现的是某个场景中的个体人物从一种情绪进入另一种情绪。按罗森的话说，「戏剧性行为取代了戏剧性情绪」。古典风格不同于巴洛克盛期风格是因为它对事物的呈现做出了不同的决定。虽然可以列出古典风格和吧洛克盛期风格的表面差异，但不能把这种变化的根源和特点理解为一组表面特征替换了另一组表面特征。罗森认为，多梅尼科·斯卡拉蒂（Domenico Scarlatti）的羽管键琴奏鸣曲是古典风格表现戏剧性场景的首批重要代表作。斯卡拉蒂的作品尽管缺乏古典风格的许多表面特征，但在基本问题上采取的是古典风格立场：「其奏鸣曲的格调变化表现为戏剧性事件，有明确的起点和发展脉络，对后代音乐家的风格产生了重要影响。」「虽然他的作品没有表现出从一种韵律过渡到另一种韵律的古典风格技巧，但在音调变化上，他已经表达出了真正的戏剧性冲突......」1

艺木史领域也有这种普遍的认识，风格源于基本立场而不是表面特征。比如，埃米尔·马勒（Emile Male）分析西欧宗教艺术图像的起源时指出，十三至十五世纪的神学家都把世界看成一个「巨大的图形符号」。这种把世界当作统一符号形式的概念是十三世纪的宗教艺术风格确立的基础，但在十五世纪的宗教艺术风格中并不是这样的。马勒写道，「深邃的象征主义主导了十三世纪教堂…...门廊雕像的排列」，因此「沙特尔大教堂的雕像形成了一种浑然天成的思想体系」。26

相比之下，十五世纪法国阿布维尔的圣乌勒弗兰大教堂（Saint-Vulfran）的正门 —— 马勒称其宏伟壮观，并把它的华美与丰富装饰与十三世纪的杰出作品相比 —— 与十三世纪百科全书式的教学风格有天壤之别。圣乌勒弗兰大教堂的雕塑项目没有受到任何此类风格理念的影响，因为它与同世纪其他杰出宗教艺术作品一样，并不把世界看成符号。作为符号风格基础的十三世纪象征主义，发展到十五世纪后少了深奥和书卷气。情感和情绪取代了图形符号和百科全书式结构。风格源于一组基本立场而不是一系列表面特征，这种论点很少出现在谈论写作风格的书中。几乎每一本关于写作的书都会在书名或者某个重要章节标题上用到「风格」这个词，很多杂志期刊还会专门出一页格式须知规定出版样式。

我们可以举其中几个例子：《芝加哥风格手册》（The Chicago Manual of Style）①、《MLA 风格手册》（MLA Style Manual）、《丰收的读者》（The Harvest Reader）最后一章「风格」、凯特·杜拉宾（KateTb）《芝加哥大学论文写作指南》（Manual for writers for Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations）第六章「风格」、斯特伦克（Strunk）和怀特（White）合著的《风格的要素》（The Elements of Style）及约瑟夫·M. 威廉姆斯（Joseph M. Williams）为他与格雷戈里·卡洛姆（Gregory Colomb）的合作写的摘要《风格：清晰、优雅的写作》（Syle: Toward Clarity and Grace）①。

① 此书有经济新潮社出版的繁体中文版《英文写作的魅力》，陈佳伶译。—— 译者注

这些指南、教材和手册所说的「风格」不是同一回事。《芝加哥风格手册》中的「风格」是一种必要的随机决定，以保证印刷文本的统一，但对思想内容或概念组织来说则无关紧要。比如就思想内容或概念组织而言，日期 1954 年 3 月 24 日是写成「March24, 1954」还是「24 March 1954」没有区别，但一篇文章中的日期应按统一格式书写，而《芝加哥风格手册》用一种随即标准保持统一。这里的「风格」是对印刷文本表面特征随机做出的必要决定。

与之相反，约瑟夫·M 威廉姆斯的《风格：清晰、优雅的写作》一书认为印刷文本的表面特征对他所说的风格无关紧要，他的风格是为了说明如何改进「观点文本」（Pointed prose）以便读者理解。

而我们上面试举出的六种风格只是管中窥豹（类似的例子不胜枚举），它们讨论的「风格」不涉及罗森和马勒所说的那种能定义风格的核心立场。

《MLA 风格手册》只是《芝加哥风格手册》的缩略版，两者的差异随机而定。凯特·杜拉宾的格式要求有很多「从《芝加哥风格手册》第 13 版改编过来」，适用于学期论文。而《丰收的读者》（The Harvest Reader）的最后一章「风格」表明风格是完成全部重要工作之后的一种装饰性元素，就像刷房子的油漆。

甚至斯特伦克和怀特的著名教科书《风格的要素》认为风格由明显的表面特征构成，书名也许会让你联想到欧几里得的《几何原本》。如果翻到《几何原本》第一页，你会看到一些基础的定义和公理，但翻到《风格的要素》第一页，你看到的是：

单数名词构成所有格加「's」

不管单数名词以什么辅音字母结尾，必须遵守这条规则。例如：

Charles's friend（查理的朋友）

Burns's poems（彭斯的诗）

the witch's malice（妖妇的毒心）

例外的情况也是有的，是指一些以 -es 或 -is 结尾的古代专有名词或古代习用词组，其所有格仅需加「'」。例如 Jesus'（耶稣的），for conscience' sake（为了良心），for righteousness' sake（为了正义）① 。

① 汉译文出自陈一鸣翻译版本，本书其他《风格的要素》选段均出自该版本，该版本书名汉译文为《英文写作指南》。—— 译者注

假如你看第五章「认识风格」，作者意在探讨「更广义的风格」，你会发现作者谈的不是核心决定，而是类似如何区分「distinguishing」和「distinguished」的显著语言表面特征：「当我们谈及菲茨杰拉德的风格时…...我们说的是他的文字在纸上发出的声音。」

斯特伦克和怀特把整个风格说成一种「高深莫测的东西」，因为仅仅学会一条条唯一要素（他们认为的表面要素），无法学会风格。「谁知道一些触动人心的音符为什么稍稍重组就不再动人了呢？」查尔斯·罗森考虑的是确立音乐风格的核心决定，而不是单个音符，他眼中的风格是一种可理解的历史进程，而不是高深莫测的东西。

约瑟夫·威廉姆斯的《风格》一书，不说高深莫测的东西，而是明智地怀疑用法规则。即便最后一章「用法」讨论了基本规则，也只是把这些用法知识点当成写作的次要技巧。没人会指责《风格》给出了一种技巧性的写作方法，因为它明确指出它不会指导你怎么写，而是指导你如何解决写作遇到的问题：假如作者已经想好了要写什么，也拟好了草稿，但是发现他的文本不能被读者理解，这时候《风格》就会告诉作者如何改变表达结构以适应读者的阅读习惯。这就是威廉姆斯的方法与我们前述所有其他人的方法的不同之处。威廉姆斯的书不是指导随机惯用表达或个人喜好的手册，而是示范如何阅读他说的「应用文」—— 包括议论文、说明文和备忘录等。了解这种范文格式后，作者就能调整论文，以便符合读者的预期。咸廉姆斯的书作为一本高等技巧指导书效果显著。但它表现的是一种修改活动 —— 与真相、语言、读者和作者这些基本问题的决定无关。从这点来说，威廉姆斯论述的是笼统的风格，不是具体某种风格。威廉姆斯所述风格已然对基本问题做出一组统一的决定，但他没有承认这些决定或承认它们可供选择。

我们列出的每本谈论风格的书，一开始提出的假设注定了最终的错误。如果一开始你就认为风格无论怎么看都是一组表面的技巧性要素清单，那你有可能学会这份清单，表现出风格，但不是特定某种风格。

在音乐和绘画领域，基本立场不同则风格不同。在几何学或逻辑学领域，基本公理不同则体系不同。在写作上，对风格要素采取的立场不同则文本风格的类型不同。只有把风格看作对核心问题采取的一种基本立场，才可能看到由其他立场构成的其他风格。

风格可以自主选择。基本立场可以由作者自主选择。相反，了解一门语言却要掌握很多不能自主选择的东西，比如每个作者都不能自由决定句子开头应用句号，最后一个字母应大写，「狗」这个词应指代猫，谓语不应与主语的单复数和人称一致，六座漂亮的砖房应说成「砖漂亮的房六座」。但你可以选择用「狗」还是「猎狗」来称呼某只狗，说「萨利大口吃着烤牛肉」而不说「烤牛肉被萨利大口吃着」，用小短句而不是巴洛克风格的华丽辞藻和长圆周句；或者把日期 1954 年 3 月 24 日写成「24 March 1954」，而不是「March 24, 1954」，但这些都是表面特征。谈论写作风格的书只是从表面上决定这些选择，一般都忽略了风格的要素 —— 表面特征的基本选择。

我们接下来会逐一介绍这些基本问题，即风格的要素，以及古典风格对这些问题的回答。这些要素分别是真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言。

### 1.4 The Classic Stand on the Elements of Style

1.4 古典风格的立场

#### 1.4.1 Truth

René Descartes provides a kind of philosophic patronage for classic style in its seventeenth-century French expression. Because the fundamental problem he addresses and the solution he offers commanded attention throughout Europe, he helped to make the attitudes that define the style, as well as the style itself, widely plausible and attractive. Although classic style does not itself depend upon specifically Cartesian assumptions or conclusions, some of Descartes's characteristic attitudes and emphases are fundamental to the style. Not least among these attitudes is Descartes's conception of his audience's access to truth. In his view, the most important issues in philosophy are of general human concern and can be understood by nonspecialist readers. One expression of this attitude is the very fact that Descartes's most famous book, usually called (misleadingly) in English Discourse on Method (1637), is written in French, not in Latin, the conventional language of advanced study and erudition at the time.

A philosophic treatise called Discourse on Method might lead its reader to expect an abstract discussion about method in general rather than a book about a particular method for doing one thing. Descartes was not, however, interested in discussing method in general, and his original title, while long, was not misleading: DISCOURSE ON THE METHOD of rightly directing one's Reason and of seeking Truth in the Sciences. There is a remarkable and attractive freshness to this book, which in little more than fifty pages of disarming narrative offers a method for separating a few certain truths from the morass of uncertain opinions and simple prejudices that everyone manages unconsciously to acquire. He presents his subject according to the order of reason, represented — not coincidentally, for the supremely rational classic mind — as identical to the order of discovery. Assimilating intellectual experience to the order of reason is a matter of course in classic style.

Descartes's little book is among the most accessible of recognized philosophic classics in the Western tradition. It is not a book by an erudite addressed to other erudites. Descartes explicitly devalues erudition. His thesis is that everybody has what is essential for identifying truth — natural reason — whether or not that person has any special educational formation. Failure to identify truth comes either from directing natural reason to the wrong objects — which can include the recondite lore of erudition — or from uncritically accepting opinion and custom.

Descartes frames his Discourse as a personal account of what he himself did and suggests that anyone who wants to do what he did can. At least ostensibly, he is not arguing a case; he is merely trying to place the reader where he himself stood in order to make his subsequent actions intelligible. His method of expression mirrors his contention that once we clear away received opinion, custom, and prejudice, what is certainly true is immediately apparent because of its distinctness and clarity. Everyone who has cleared away the normal mental impediments is equally capable of perceiving what is certainly true and can personally stand behind his perception. What is certainly true can be personally verified by each individual — whether that individual has mastered Latin and the liberal arts or speaks only low Breton and has spent his life farming — and without the need of any outside authority.

From one point of view, classic style can been seen as a version of Descartes's approach to truth in which the domain of truth has been expanded to include, first, conventional information, and then those very opinions and customs that Descartes filtered out. For Descartes, there are very few certain truths, but everybody has a natural endowment that, once purified, gives access to them. Classic style treats all its objects as if they were equally available to every observer and as if every reader has whatever may be necessary to verify what the writer presents. What is a natural endowment in Descartes becomes a kind of cultural competence in classic style. The certain truths Descartes perceived are internal and essentially timeless. To verify them we need to return to a sort of state of nature as it was before we had acquired any local conventions. Classic style treats external objects, contingent facts, and even opinions as if they too are beyond doubt or discussion. To verify them we need to acquire local conventions so widespread within the relevant culture that the style treats them as if they were natural endowments.

To see how this attitude about verification applies in practice, suppose someone wants to know the color of a house two blocks away. The competence needed to check and report back is so widespread that we might think it pedantic to object to the claim that「anyone」could do it. Let us leave to the fine print all the qualifications: anyone old enough to know his colors, anyone with normal vision, anyone we can trust not to lie, anyone with a normal memory, anyone who will not just wander off after he has checked the house, and so on. If the information needed includes the street address, the pool of people competent to check it is slightly smaller, but as in the case of checking the color, it seems to be possible to ascertain the address with certainty, and again, anyone who knows a simple convention can just look at the numbers attached to the house and report back. Almost anyone whose eyes are pointed in the right direction can certainly get it right. Let us consider a few other bits of information that can be treated as routine to the point of being universally accessible and certain even though each one actually requires a slightly more specific competence based on a human convention that must be learned. Finding a bibliographic citation is like checking a special kind of address: anyone who knows how to use a library and knows the conventional form of a bibliographic entry can just look it up. Finding the citation for a painting in a museum is slightly more specialized, but like the previous examples, it is something that anyone who knows a few simple conventions can certainly look up and get straight. None of these tasks involves argument or reasoning, although they each require something more than a universally shared natural endowment. It seems plausible that the correct color, the correct address, the correct bibliographic citation, the correct catalogue number for a painting can certainly be known by just about anyone in a particular culture over the age of about ten who happens to be standing in the right place.

It is common enough to simplify matters and treat these bits of knowledge as if they were certainties equally accessible to anyone. Classic style expands the domain of truth to include anything that might require not merely the knowledge of a convention but even the ability to make a judgment.

In classic style, opinions stated clearly and distinctly are treated as if they can be verified by simple observation. The writer does not typically attempt to persuade by argument. The writer merely puts the reader in a position to see whatever is being presented and suggests that the reader will be able to verify it because the style treats whatever conventions or even prejudices it operates from as if these were, like natural reason, shared by everyone. It is a style of disguised assertion. A. J. Liebling writes,「The prize fighter is as reluctant as the next artist to recognize his disintegration.」What is at stake here includes the claim that boxing is an art. The point is not argued or even asserted. It is referred to as if it were a fact that the reader, because she shares the competence that Liebling himself has, will recognize as true once it is presented. And that competence itself, Liebling implies, is a convention. The list of the arts, as we all know, includes music, painting, ballet, boxing.

If a writer in this style wants her readers to think that a certain restaurant has a great cellar, a certain book is beautifully written, or a certain time and place attained the summits of civilization, these complex matters of judgment, open to endless qualification and debate, are presented as if they were as obvious as the Library of Congress call number for the first edition of War and Peace in the Maude translation, and as easy to check as that number is for somebody who happens to be in the Library of Congress. The classic writer prototypically neither argues nor asserts what is true because it is part of the definition of the style that anybody in a position to see truth can recognize it for herself.

Truth Can Be Known

There is probably nothing more fundamental to the attitude that defines classic style than the enabling convention that truth can be known. People tend to deceive themselves; they want to make exceptions for reasons of sentimentality or friendship, vanity or interest. They want to avoid knowing truth when truth is painful, to distort truth when truth is inconvenient. But there is no doubt, in the classic attitude, that truth can be known. Knowing truth is as much a part of the equipment of a classic writer as knowing how to play the violin is part of the equipment of a concert violinist. Is it possible to play the violin? can that question occur to a concert violinist? Could there be such a thing as a concert violinist if it were not possible to play the violin? Could there be such a thing as a classic writer if it were not possible to know truth?

Truth Is Not Contingent

The concept of truth that grounds classic style does not depend on what might be called「point of view」or「angle of vision.」The truth of things can be perceived by attentive people of any age or condition. Human experience reveals the same conflicts, the same needs and desires, the same weaknesses and virtues. To pay close attention to personal experience is to see through it to truths that run through all such experience.

Thucydides, writing in Greece in the fifth century B.C., assumes that anything true he says about human conflicts and human institutions in The Peloponnesian War will be verified by the sense of recognition he will elicit from readers who will live through other wars in other times or other places because what is thoroughly local is thoroughly universal, if properly perceived. As Thucydides himself puts it, he seeks「an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it.」

An experience that is uniquely personal and must therefore be accepted on faith is not a suitable subject for classic style. The reader cannot verify it from his own experience and cannot even check it against earlier testimonies of experience, such as Thucydides'. In the classic view, what cannot be universally verified cannot be true.

The classic attitude is thus both foundationalist and universalist — local events, properly observed, will always disclose universal truths as their foundations. This is an enabling convention. Just as the enabling convention「truth can be known」contradicts the view of the radical skeptic, so the enabling convention「truth is eternal」contradicts the views of the romantic, the relativist, and the ironist for whom truth is contingent. Classic style assumes that truths exist prior to an individual's experience but that knowledge of what is true is achieved through individual experience. Universal truths are eternal and will always be verified by normal experience. They are eternal in two senses: they are discovered, not created, and future experience will always corroborate past testimony. An individual discovers hypocrisy through his experience, but hypocrisy well observed and well described in one time and place will be recognized across cultures and across centuries, since to observe well and describe well in classic style is always to transcend contingent situations. Circumstances change; truth abides.

Truth Is Pure

Truth, in the classic attitude, is a standard for measuring human virtue. As such, it demonstrates an eternal human deficiency, since human virtue exists only in particular human actions, and human actions inevitably involve complex motives, contradictory emotions, and distracting sensations. These things are murky and fluid; they induce moral vertigo in all normal people. The resulting confusion can be temporarily and unsatisfactorily stabilized by deception, irony, and pretense. It can never be escaped.

Truth, on the other hand, has no feelings, no emotions, no motives. It exists always without seeking for anything. It is complete in a way that no person ever is. People feel their inadequacies and desires; they have ambitions. Their hungers cannot be permanently satisfied, merely temporarily assuaged. Truth, eternal and immutable, always remains available to the disciplined writer as a model and a standard, but classic prose is a refinement of human experience. It is what can be known; it is not what can be lived.

Alone with a piece of paper, a writer can submit to the discipline of classic style, prune away ambition and pretense, and achieve the clarity and suppleness that truth confers. But such moments are temporary accomplishments, not permanent possessions.

The classic attitude, especially in its origins, acknowledges human inadequacies: we are victims of our ambitions; fully accurate self-knowledge is unavailable; self-interest leads to self-deception; we are inconsistent, unreliable, impure. Yet the classic attitude is never despairing: these inadequacies are like an unfortunate layer of corruption over a fundamental soundness. We are not impotent, merely weak, and we can grow stronger. We recognize truth when we see it, even though the encounter with truth is brief and difficult to sustain. In the classic view, we can not only aspire to what is fundamentally true and valuable, we can even — and at the key moments — succeed in these aspirations. In Descartes, in parts of Pascal, and in certain American traditions influenced by classic style, encouragement constitutes the principal tone. For La Rochefoucauld, the classic attitude is a consolation for our failures. For Jefferson, it is rather more like the means to success.

The Motive Is Truth

The classic writer is licensed, so to speak, by the truth of what he says, not by his social position, political power, or technical knowledge. Classic writing is animated by a common motive, regardless of its local subject or local purpose

In classic style, the reader and writer are brought together by a common recognition of truth. The writer is never merely indulging personal interests. As a result, a complementary relationship is created between writer and reader: the writer presents truth, and the reader recognizes it. Of course, the classic writer may in fact serve personal interests through his writing, but the attitude adopted in classic prose is that the writer's governing motive is to present truth. To the extent that a work of classic prose has obvious practical purposes, the classic attitude takes the position that they are merely accidental.

One consequence of this attitude for classic prose is that the aphoristic quality of classic prose concerns observation (「No one is ever so happy or unhappy as he thinks」), not morality (「Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones」), or behavior (「Look before you leap」), although it tacitly conveys its expectations about both. The classic writer presents himself not as a guide to morals or behavior, but as an observer of truth.

Even when the classic writer's motive is persuasion, he is reluctant to admit it overtly, and even when he admits it, he does so conditionally, noting that persuasion can never take priority over the abiding motive of presenting truth. Local or practical motives are always constrained to respect this governing motive.

The classic writer presents truth, and typically takes the position that of course the reader will recognize truth. The classic writer rarely writes as if he is pressing claims and presenting arguments, but rather pretends that he is presenting subjects and conducting analyses. When, on rare occasions, the classic writer adopts the stance that the reader will not believe what is being presented, he never concedes that the reader's disposition should influence what he says. A writer who wishes to persuade is constrained from ever telling the audience something it is unwilling to believe, and this is a compromise unacceptable in the classic attitude. The classic attitude compels writers, in extreme cases, to express truth and leave the audience to its folly. In that case — as always — the writer's explicit motive is not hope of persuasion but rather respect for truth. It is the choice Socrates makes in the Apology.

1.4.1 真相

勒内·笛卡儿以一本法语哲学著作助推了十七世纪古典风格的发展。因为他思考的基本问题及为此提供的解决办法吸引了全欧洲的关注，他使这种决定风格的态度及这种风格本身广泛流传。虽然笛卡儿的假设或结论不是古典风格的直接依据，但笛卡儿的一些标志性态度和侧重点是古典风格的基础。最主要的一条是笛卡儿认为读者有权知道真相。在他看来，哲学上最重要的问题都是人类普遍关注的问题，非专业读者也能理解。这种态度可以从笛卡儿最著名的书使用的语言看出来，这本书通常被误称作《谈谈方法》（1637），书写语言是法语，而不是做高深学问常用的拉丁语。

一本名为《谈谈方法》的哲学论著，也许会让读者以为这本书是对一般方法的抽象讨论，而不是某种具体的做事方法。然而，笛卡儿对探讨一般性方法不感兴趣，他原来的书名尽管长，但不至于让人误解：《谈谈正确运用自己的理性在各门学问里寻求真理的方法》。这本小书新颖别致，在五十多页的篇幅里指出了每个人无意中都会陷进去的思想泥潭 —— 模糊观点和简单偏见，并告诉读者如何把它们和少数已确定的真相区分开来。他阐述主题遵照的是推理顺序，与发现顺序完全一样。对笛卡儿这种十分理性的古典思维来说，这不是巧合。他将思想活动按照推理顺序展开，这在古典风格中很常见。

历数西方传统的哲学经典名著，笛卡儿这本小书属于最通俗易懂的。它不是一本学究写给学究看的书。笛卡儿明确反对把学问做得深奥难懂。他认为每个人都有识别真相的必要能力 —— 推理本能 —— 无论他是否具备特殊教育背景。如果识别不出真相，要么是推理本能用错了对象，如晦涩难懂的学问，要么是对观点和习惯不加批判地全盘照收。

笛卡儿认为《谈谈方法》这本书描述的是他个人的亲身经历，还暗示他做过的这些事情任谁想做就都能做到。至少表面上，他没去争辩什么；他只是试着把读者放到他自己所在的位置，方便读者理解他接下来要做什么。他的表达方式传达了他的主张：只要我们消除成见、习惯及偏见，真相的明显和清晰的特点会使它立即显露出来。只要消除常规的思想障碍，每个人都能看到明显的真相，而且可以亲自佐证自己的观察。每个个体都能自已验证真相 —— 无论这个人学过拉丁语和历史文学，还是一辈子从事农耕只会说低等的布列塔尼语 —— 而且不用依赖任何外界权威。

从某种角度看，古典风格可以看作笛卡儿真相观的扩充，其中既有传统信息，也有那些被笛卡儿摒弃的观点和习惯。笛卡儿认为，确定的真相少之又少，但每个人都有一种本能：一旦净化思想，就能看清真相。古典风格无论谈论什么，好像每个观察者都能看到，好像每位读者都具备必要的能力验证作者所述。笛卡儿所说的本能，在古典风格中是一种文化能力。笛卡儿观察到的是一种内在的、永恒的真相。要验证它们，我们需要回到某种自然状态，这种状态就好像我们从未习得过任何某时某地的规约。古典风格把外在事物、有条件的事实甚至观点都当作确凿无疑的东西。要验证它们，我们需要学习某时某地的规约，这些规约根植于所在的文化，在古典风格看来相当于与生俱来的本能。

要看这种验证态度如何运用到现实中，可以假设某人想知道两个街区以外的一幢房子是什么颜色。查看并反映情况是一种普遍的能力，如果咬文嚼字反对「任何人」能做到就有点迂腐了。我们可以附注一列「任何人」的条件：年龄大到可以认识颜色，视力正常，绝不说谎，有正常记忆力，看完房子后不会到处闲逛，等等。如果还要确认房子所在的街道地址，在这个能力范围内的人就少了些。能确认颜色，似乎也就能肯定地确认地址，同样，任何人只要知道一条简单的规约，也能确认房子上挂的门牌号并反映这个情况。任何人只要看的方向没问题，几乎都不会错。让我们看看一些别的信息，这些信息可以看作那种人人都能获取和确认的普通信息，虽然每条信息实际上都要求学会某条人类规约以掌握更具特点的能力。查找文献引文就像确认一种特殊地址：只要知道怎么运用图书馆功能，知道文献条目的常规形式，任何人都能查到。在一座博物馆找到一幅画的出处是更专业一点的任务，但和前面的例子一样，任何人只要知道一些简单规约，肯定能查并能查到。这些任务没有什么需要争辩或理论的地方，虽然要求的能力超出人普遍具有的原始本能，可以说，十岁以上的任何人，只要知道特定文化背景，所在的地方也适当，都能获取正确的颜色、正确的地址、正确的文献引文、正确的画作条目编号。

简化事物，把各种知识当作任何人都能获取的确切之物，这很常见。古典风格把真相的范围从规约性知识扩至形成观点的能力。

在古典风格中，清晰明确的观点被当作经简单观察即可验证的确切事物。作者通常不会用论证来说服读者。作者只是把读者放在某个位置上，让他们去看所呈现的内容，并暗示读者可以验证它，因为古典风格把它依据的任何规约甚至偏见当作推理本能一样的东西，人所共享。它是一种不易察觉的断言。李伯龄（A. J. Liebling）写道：「优秀的拳击手像任何一位艺术家一样，不愿意承认自己大不如前。」（The prize fighter is as reluctant as the next artist to recognize his disintegration）4 这句话的关键信息包括「拳击是一门艺术」这个论点。这个论点没有论证，甚至也没有断言。作者提及这点就好像它是一个事实，只要说出来，读者就知道是真的，因为读者也有李伯龄那样的能力。这种能力本身，从李伯龄的暗示可以看出，是一种规约。正如我们都知道的，艺术名单有音乐、绘画、芭蕾和拳击。

一位古典风格作者如果想向读者表达某家餐厅有一个很棒的地窖，某本书写得很精彩，某时某处达到了人类文明巅峰，经他的呈现，这些容易帮致设完没了的解释和争论的复杂观点，就跟去关国国会图书馆状《战争与和平》第一版莫德英译本的素取号一样显而易见，就好像让一位刚好在美国国会图书馆的人找这本书的索取号一样轻而易举。古典风格作者通常不去论证，也不去断言什么是真相，因为在古典风格的定义中，任何人处于观察真相的位置都能自己认出真相。

真相是可知的

对定义古典风格的态度，最重要的莫不如「真相是可知的」这条基础规约。人容易自我欺骗；因为感伤或友情、虚荣或利益，他们想获得特别待遇。真相带来痛苦时，他们想屏蔽真相，真相带来麻烦时，他们想歪曲真相。在古典风格的态度中，真相是可知的这点毋庸置疑。知道真相是古典风格作者的必备能力之一，就像知道如何演奏小提琴是音乐会小提琴手的必备能力之一。小提琴能用来演奏乐曲吗？这问题是否会发生在一名音乐会小提琴手身上？如果小提琴不能演奏，会有音乐会小提琴手吗？如果真相不可知，会有古典风格作者吗？

真相不是偶然的

古典风格的真相观不是某种被称为「视点」或「视角」的东西。无论处于什么年龄和状态，一个人只要细致观察，就能看到事物的真相。人类经验揭示的是同样的冲突，同样的需求和欲望，同样的缺点和优点。仔细观察个体经验，有助于认识贯穿所有这类经验的真相。

公元前五世纪的希腊作家修昔底德（Thucydides），在《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》（History of the Peloponnesian War）中说到人类冲突和人类制度，他认为凡是他说对了的，都能在读者那里找到认同和验证。尽答这些读者经历的战争不同，所在的时代和地区也不同，只要用正确的方式观察，某时某地的个别情况可以代表普遍情况。正如修昔底德自己所言，他希望「正确认识过去以帮助解释未来，两者在人类事物的进程中如不能相互映照，也必定相似」。5

纯属个人的经验只能照单全收，不适合用作古典风格的主题。读者无法用自己的经验进行验证，甚至无法根据前人的事例（如修昔底德的经验）加以核实。对古典风格来说，不能被广泛验证的不可能是真相。

因此，古典风格的态度既是基础主义也是普遍主义一个别事件，只要正确地观察，总能揭示出作为共同基础的普遍真相。这是一条基础规约。「真相可知」与激进怀疑论者的观点对立，同样，「真相永恒」这条基础规约与浪漫主义者、相对主义者和反讽者的观点对立，因为后者认为真相是偶然的。古典风格认为，真相先于个体经验而存在，但只能通过个体经验认识真相。普遍的真相是永恒的，而且总能被普通经验验证。这里的真相永恒有两重含义：真相只能发现不能被创造；未来的经验总会证实过去的事实。个体通过自身经验发现的虚伪，只要根据此时此地的情况准确地观察和描述，即使跨越不同文化不同世纪也能传达出来，因为准确观察和准确描述超越了偶然情境。时移世易，真相常驻。

真相是纯粹的

在古典风格的态度中，真相是一把衡量人类美德的标尺。它本身展示的是一种永恒的人类缺陷，因为人类美德只存在于特定的人类行为中，而人类行为总会涉及复杂的动机、矛盾的情绪和困惑的感受。这些东西混沌不明、变幻不定，会引发所有普通人道德上的犹疑。这种困惑可以通过一时的欺骗、讽刺或伪装勉强安抚，但永远无法逃避。

但另一方面，真相无关感觉、情绪和动机。它存在不是为了谋求什么。它这种完美无人可及。人们知道自己的缺陷和欲望，他们又怀有野心。满足人们的渴望无法一劳永逸，只能暂时安抚。真相永恒不变，总能被训练有素的作者获取，成为一种模范、一种标准，但古典文章是对人类经验去其糟粕取其精华的结果。真相可以被知道，但无法成为一种生活方式。

只要动手写，作者就会信守古典风格的戒律，撒下野心和伪装，做到真相赋予的清晰和灵活。但这只维持得了一时，无法永久拥有。

古典风格的态度，尤其在发展之初，承认人类的缺陷：我们是自己的野心的受害者；自我认识不可能完全正确；寻求自身利益的结果是自我欺骗；不能始终如一、不可靠、不纯洁是我们的本性。但是，古典风格的态度从无绝望：这些缺陷只是腐坏其外，内核仍坚实完好。我们并非无能，只是羸弱，而且我们可以变得更强大。只要看到真相，我们就能认出来，尽管与真相只是擦肩而过。在古典风格看来，追求真正有价值的真相不仅是一种希望，甚至可以在必要之时成为现实。笛卡儿的作品、帕斯卡的部分作品，以及一些受古典风格影响的美国传统作品的主基调都是鼓舞。拉罗什福科认为古典风格的态度是对我们自身不足的一种慰藉。杰弗逊认为它更像通向成功的方法。

动机是真相

可以说古典风格作者之所以被认可，不是因为他的社会地位、政治权力或技术知识，而是因为他说的是真相。古典写作可以有各自的主题和目的，但都源于同一个动机。

在古典风格中，对真相的共同认识使读者与作者彼此靠近。作者从不会只想着个人利益。因此作者与读者之间存在一种互补关系：作者呈现真相，读者识别真相。当然，古典风格作者实际上可能会利用写作服务个人利益，但古典文章的态度是，作者的首要动机是呈现真相。即使一篇古典文章有明显的实用目的，古典态度只是将其视为偶然。

因为这种态度，古典文章的格言侧重观察，而非道德或行为，尽管暗含了后面两层期望。比如，古典文章会说「人们总是夸大自己的幸福或不幸」（No one is ever so happy or unhappy as he thinks），但不会说「自身有弱点，勿揭他人短」（Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones）或「三思而后行」（Look before you leap）。古典风格作者的姿态不是道德或行为导师，而是观察真相的人。

就算古典风格作者的动机是说服，他也不愿公开承认，就算他承认了这点，他也是有条件地承认，指出说服永远不会超越呈现真相成为首要动机。个别的或实用的动机总是服从这个首要动机。

古典风格作者呈现真相，通常默认读者当然会认出真相。古典风格作者很少为了推行主张和展开论证而写作，表现出来的只是呈现和分析主题。在某些少数场合，古典风格作者觉得读者不会相信呈现的内容时，他也不会退让到按读者的喜好决定怎么说话。作者为了让读者信服，对读者不愿相信的东西闭口不提，这种妥协不是古典态度。古典态度强制古典风格作者在极端的情况下坚持表达真相，读者信不信是读者自己的事。那样的情况下 —— 自始至终 —— 古典风格作者的动机明显不是为了说服，而是尊重真相。这是苏格拉底在《苏格拉底的申辩》里所做的选择。

#### 1.4.2 Presentation

Prose Is a Window

In the classic attitude, writing serves to present something else: its subject. The subject is conceived of as a「thing」distinct from the writing, something that exists in the world and is independent of any presentation. Clarity is the central virtue of classic prose because the classic writer's defining task is to present something he has previously perceived. Self-evident truths, Madame de Chevreuse's character, the power of well-ordered thoughts, the food of France are conceived as「things」with their proper characteristics, existing「in the world」and completely independent of their presentation. The language of classic prose serves these things and should never draw attention to itself. Naturally, when we read La Rochefoucauld's passage on Madame de Chevreuse, we are looking at words; we cannot look through them to Madame de Chevreuse herself, nor could we possibly know what La Rochefoucauld wants to tell us even if we could see her. Nevertheless, classic style operates on the premise that La Rochefoucauld's experience of Madame de Chevreuse is a「thing」that he wants to present through a medium that will, at its best, be transparent, as if the reader were looking at something through a perfectly clean and undistorting window; the window should not draw attention to itself, and will not unless it is obviously defective in some way.

Classic writers speak with conviction. That conviction, they imply, comes from knowledge or experience of something that exists before the writing and is completely independent of it. Their prose is conceived of as a perfectly efficient instrument: it neither invents nor distorts. It is as if the language they use had no characteristics of its own and therefore could not be considered a「thing.」Classic prose does not ask the reader to observe it as if it too is a thing; it invites the reader to look through it to what it presents. It draws attention to itself only when there is something wrong with it.

Consider Jefferson's phrase「that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.」Jefferson is an accomplished writer, but that is taken for granted and not something he wants his readers even to notice. If someone read the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and found the writing itself to be the most memorable thing about it, there would be something wrong with it.

Contrast Jefferson's style with that of Jeremy Bentham on the fallacy of begging the question:

Having, without the form, the force of an assumption — and having for its object, and but too commonly for its effect, a like assumption on the part of the hearer or reader, — the sort of allegation in question, how ill-grounded soever, is, when thus masked, apt to be more persuasive than when expressed simply and in its own proper form: especially where, to the character of a censorial adding the quality and tendency of an impassioned allegation, it tends to propagate, as it were by contagion, the passion by which it was suggested.

Bentham is talking about a fallacy here; he has no reason to want to place his own writing in the foreground, but whatever he may be saying about begging the question, what is likely to make the strongest impression on anybody who reads him is his manner of presentation. It is as if we expect to find a window and encounter a fun-house mirror. Bentham's sentence can be puzzled out. We can determine what he means to say. We could rewrite it in classic style. But classic prose never has to be puzzled out. We never have to rework the expression in order to see what it means to present.

Classic Prose Is Perfect Performance

When a jazz master improvises, perhaps the most impressive aspect of the performance is its appearance of impromptu perfection. Although improvised, the performance has no mistake, false step, or deficiency. It looks inevitable, as if it could have been done in no other way, as if every stage were known to the performer from the beginning.

Paradoxically, we know that if the same jazz master performed the improvisation again, it would be entirely different, but it would still appear as if it could have been done in no other way, as if it were inevitable.

This same characterization might apply to a knock-out sequence in a boxing match, a lethal volley at Wimbledon, a winning stretch move in a horse race, or an ingenious screen pass in football. It is perfect, and we confront a paradox. We know that the performance is not just a rare example of everything going right, because the masters of these arts can give similar performances repeatedly. The performance therefore had to be prepared, because no performance can be routinely perfect without preparation. Yet it is difficult to imagine just what such preparation might have been. The performances are not canned. They are fresh and spontaneous even though we know that they are the result of practice and effort. The basketball player who sinks the ball amid a chaotic field of play without looking at the basket can do that because she has memorized a certain spot on the floor to the point where she no longer even needs to see the basket to hit it. But the preparation is hidden, and the performance looks like magic.

Classic style is perfect performance, with no hesitation, revision, or backtracking. Its essential fiction is that this perfection happens at the first try. Classic style does not acknowledge process or stages of discovery, does not acknowledge revision or successive refinements. The performance suggests that to write this way, one can never hesitate, grope, or struggle, whether in thought or in language. This is part of the performance, and when it succeeds it does not seem to be a performance at all. Its corollary fiction is that the performance cannot be prepared because it has no parts that could be worked on separately or in stages. It is seamless. The writer appears simply to have been born with an ability that the rest of us lack. To someone attempting to learn classic style, these fictions can be intimidating. In learning this style, it is helpful to remember that these are fictions.

Because classic style presents fully refined thought in inevitable prose, it is final. This finality excludes two kinds of hedges, which we will call hedges of process and hedges of liability. Hedges of process are hesitations and uncertainties that arise because one is in the middle of thought. For example, one may say something, then think better of it, and then add a disclaimer or a qualifier. But in the model of classic prose, the thought is final, so hedges of process are rare.

Hedges of liability are insurance against the possibility of having overlooked something or being ignorant of something that would change the writer's views or conclusions. For example, a writer may say that in her limited experience, such and such is true. This hedges the writer against contradiction by experience she has not had. But in the model of classic prose, the thought is fully refined, so hedges of liability are rare. The classic writer does not say,「As far as I know, there was never a more gallant court than that of Henri II,」but rather,「There was never a more gallant court than that of Henri II.」

There is a third sort of hedge that classic prose omits, which we will call hedges of worth. The classic writer spends no time justifying her project. The classic writer does not compare its worth to the worth of other projects. A classic writer will write about milk, for example, with no indication that there can be a question about the worth of writing about milk, no indication that the reader could entertain any doubt about the worth of writing about milk. A classic writer might begin an essay on milk with the claim,「In spite of its liquid state, milk must always be considered as a food and not as a beverage.」A classic writer might begin an essay on a little-known species of bird with the observation,「Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage.」Classic writers do not distract readers with questions of the worth of the project. There is no hierarchy of importance of subjects in classic writing. Everything is in close focus.

Every Word Counts

It is possible to skim certain styles. Most after-dinner speeches are presented in styles that claim only part of our attention. Many textbooks and news articles are written in styles that allow us to bounce over words and phrases and still feel that we have extracted the sense accurately.

Browsing is different from skimming. In browsing, we look from thing to thing, deciding what to choose. Classic style allows browsing but not skimming. We may turn to just one paragraph, say, in an essay, or even to one sentence, and focus on just that. But once we focus on a unit in classic style, and intend to understand it, then we must pay attention to every detail. Writer and reader assume that every word counts. If the reader skips a single word or phrase or sentence, the sense of the unit may be lost. Classic style contains crucial nuances, which can be lost in skimming.

Clarity Everywhere Is Not Accuracy Everywhere

Fine, accurate distinctions and subtle nuance are among the most typical features of classic style. But classic style has a clear hierarchy of goals; what is subordinate to the main issue can never be allowed to obscure that issue or distract attention from it. When accuracy in the sense of being exhaustively correct involves complicated qualifications of no consequence to the main issue, classic writers do not hesitate to simplify. In this frame, accuracy becomes pedantry if it is indulged for its own sake. A classic writer will phrase a subordinate point precisely but without the promise that it is technically accurate. The convention between writer and reader is that the writer is not to be challenged on these points because they are merely scaffolding.

Waverley Root begins The Food of France,「As far back as the records go, the people of the land now known of as France have thought of food in terms of its taste more often than in terms of its nutritive qualities.」Root wants to indicate that the culinary traditions he treats are immemorial, but the actual documentary history or demographic realities of France are not at issue. It would be silly to question whether Vercingetorix the Gaul really thought about food more often in terms of taste or nutritive qualities. The subordinate point is stated with care and precision, but without a tortured accuracy that would bury the essential distinction between nutrition and taste under a ton of scholarly documentation.

1.4.2 呈现

文章即窗户

在古典风格的态度中，写作是为了呈现写作之外的东西：它的主题。主题被看作一种不同于写作的「事物」，在这个世上实实在在地存在，与用什么方式呈现无关。古典文章的主要特点是清晰，因为古典风格作者的首要任务是呈现先前已观察过的事物。不言自明的真相、谢弗勒兹夫人的个性、条分缕晰的力量、法国美食，都被看作「事物」，有着各自专有的特征，「在世上」存在，完全独立于它们的呈现方式。古典文章的语言服务于这些事物，但不应让人过分关注语言本身。当我们阅读拉罗什福科描述谢弗勒兹夫人的段落时，我们看的自然是文字；我们不可能通过文字看到谢弗勒兹夫人本人，即使我们能见到她，我们也不可能知道拉罗什福科想告诉我们什么。不过古典风格依据的前提是拉罗什福科限中的谢弗勒兹夫人是一种「事物」，他用来呈现的媒介最好是透明的，就像一面极其干净又不会失真的窗户：这扇窗本身不该引人注目，也不会这样，除非某方面的问题太明显。

古典风格作者说话语气坚定。这种坚定源自对事物的认识和体验在写作之前就已发生且完全独立于写作。他们的文章被当作一种十分高效的媒介：不编造也不歪曲。好像他们用的语言没有自己的特征，算不上一件「事物」。古典文章不会让读者把文章本身也看成一件事物；它让读者通过它看到它呈现的东西。只有文章有问题时，文章本身才会引人注目。

看看杰弗逊的这句话「人人生而平等；人人都享有上帝赋予的某些不可转让的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。」① 杰弗逊是一位杰出的作者，但这是理所当然的事情，他都没想到让读者关注这点。假如有谁读了 1776 年的《独立宣言》，记得最深刻的是文章本身，那文章可能就有问题。

① 汉译文出自（世界各国法律大典美国法典（宪法行政法卷）》吴新平翻泽版本，本书其他《独立宣言》选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

比较一下杰弗逊的风格与杰里米·边沁（Jeremy Bentham）论述「循环论证自证谬论」的风格：

选段 2-1

它有（虽无假设的形式）假设的力量 —— 以及（就目标及过于普遍的效果而言）在听者或读者心中构建的类似假设这类未经证实的断言，无论多么站不住脚，经过这般粉饰之后，往往比用一种简单、适合它的方式表达更有说服力：尤其是赋予假定的判断不容置疑的激昂论调后，它往往会大肆宣扬它所暗示的激昂，如传染一般。6

边沁在这里讲的是一种谬误，没理由突显自己的写作，但不管他谈到循环论证哪些方面，任何人读完后印象最深刻的可能都是他的呈现方式。这就像我们本来想找一扇窗户，却遇到了一面哈哈镜。边沁的句子多琢磨几遍也能懂。我们可以判断他要说什么。我们可以用古典风格改写它。但古典文章从来都不需要过多琢磨。我们从来不用改写之后才清楚它想呈现什么。

完美表演

当一位爵士大师即兴表演时，也许最让人惊叹的是，表演看起来即兴又完美。虽然即兴而作，但表演没有失误，没有出错的舞步，没有瑕疵。看起来非此不可，好像用别的任何方式都不行，好像一开始表演者就对每一段都了然于心。

相悖的是，我们知道，如果让同一位爵士乐大师还原前面的即兴表高，将是完全不同的表演，但看起来好像仍然没有更好的方式，非此不可。

我们可以用上面同样的方式描述拳击比赛的一次击倒绝杀，温布尔登网球此赛的一记致命截击，赛马比赛冲喇终点的制胜一跃，或者美式足球比赛的一次掩护短传。这都很完美，而我们面对的是一个悖论。我们知道，表演不出现任何失误的情况并不少见，因为精通这些艺术的人可以重复类似表演。因此表演要预先做好准备，因为没有准备的表演不可能总是完美的。不过这种准备该是什么样，很难想象得到。表演不是预先录制好的。它们是临场发挥的即兴表演，虽然我们知道它们是长期训练和努力的结果。篮球运动员在混乱的赛场上投篮，不看篮筐就能投进，因为他已经对球场上的某个位置熟稔于心。但是，赛前准备是私下进行的，表演看起来就像魔术一样。

古典风格是完美的表演，不会有犹豫、修正或回溯。这种一次就成功的完美虽是假象，但必不可少。古典风格不承认发现的过程和步骤，不承认需要修正和反复推敲。这种表演暗示，按照这种方式写作，无论思想还是语言，都绝不能犹豫、摸寻或挣扎。这也是表演的一部分，做到这点后，就看不出一点表演痕迹。这自然产生一种假象，这种表演无法事先准备，因为它不能分成不同部分，单独或分步练习，它浑然天成。作者看上去生来就有一种我们其他人没有的天赋。对想试着学习古夹风格的人来说，这些假象让人望而生畏。记住这些只是假象，会有助于学习古典风格。

因为古典风格用非此不可的语言呈现充分斟酌的思想，所以它是终局性表达。这种终局排除了两种防范态度，我们称为过程防范和责任防范。过程防范源自边写边思考的犹豫与不确定。比如，一个人可能说了什么，又想到更好的表达，就又加了个免责声明或限定条件。但按古典文章的模式，思想是终局性思考，所以很少出现过程防范。

责任防范是用来防止疏忽或者漏掉什么的，以免影响作者的观点或结论的正确性。比如，作者可能会说就他有限的经验来看，什么跟什么是正确的。这就避免了作者因经验不足而导致观点有误。但是按照古典风格的模式，思想是充分斟酌过的，所以很少出现责任防范。古典风格作者不会说：「据我所知，没有哪个时期的宫廷比亨利二世时期的宫廷更勇猛的了」，但他会说，「没有哪个宫廷比亨利二世时期的宫廷更勇猛的了」。

还有第三种防范是古典风格拒绝的，我们称为价值防范。古典风格作者不会花时间讨论这个主题值不值得写。古典风格作者不会把该主题的价值与其他主题的价值相提并论。比如，古典风格作者要写与牛奶相关的主题，就不会怀疑牛奶是否值得写，也不会担心读者会怀疑牛奶值不值得写。古典风格作者可能在文章开头这样描述牛奶：「尽管是液态，牛奶一向被看作食物而不是饮料。」7 古典风格作者介绍一种不常见的鸟，可能从观察开始写，「与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用喙捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆枝或铁丝网上储存起来」。古典风格作者不会用某个主题是否值得讨论这类问题干扰读者。古典写作的主题没有大小或主次之分。每件事物都值得细细观察。

一字不落

有些风格可以略读。大多数饭后闲谈所用的风格只需要部分注意力。很多教材和时事新闻的写作风格允许跳过某些字词，且不影响正确理解要旨。

浏览不同于略读。浏览时，我们逐条搜寻，决定选择什么信息。古典风格可以浏览但不可以略读。比如，我们看一篇论文，可能看到某个段落，或者甚至某句话，专注在那里。一旦我们专注古典风格的某个单元，要想弄懂它，我们必须关注每个细节。作者和读者假定每个字都很重要。如果读者略过某个字、词或句子，这个单元的语义可能会缺失。

古典风格有很多细微但重要的字词，略读容易漏掉。

处处清晰不是处处较真

古典风格最典型的特征包括细微差异和微妙变化。但古典风格有一个清晰的目标层级，不能因为细枝末节的问题埋没主要问题或抢占注意力。若为了精确，要详尽无遗地列出复杂的限定条件，却无助于表达主要问题，古典风格作者会毫不犹豫地简化。为了精确而精确是迂腐。古典风格作者会准确地表述某个子观点，但不保证严格意义上的精确。作者和读者默守着一条规约：作者不会在这些问题上受到挑战，因为它们只是搭建脚手架的组件。

维瓦利·鲁特（Waverley Root）在《法国美食》（The Food ofFramnce）这本书的开头写道，「早在有书面记载以前，法国这片土地早期的居民想到食物时，想的多是口味而不是营养价值。」9 鲁特想表明，他讲述的烹饪传统自古就有，但法国实际有记载的历史或人口现实不是他要讨论的问题。如果去问高卢人首领维钦托利（Vercingetorix the Gaul）想到食物时想的是味道还是营养，就显得愚蠢了。作者审慎准确地陈述子观点，但不会字字较真，把营养与味道这条主要差异埋没在一堆学术文献中。

#### 1.4.3 Scene

The Model Is One Person Speaking to Another

The idiom of classic style is the voice of conversation. The writer adopts the pose of a speaker of near-perfect efficiency whose sentences are the product of the voice rather than some instrument of writing. Johnson's sentence about Shakespeare is prototypically unclassic because it could never be taken for speech. Classic style models itself on speech and can be read aloud properly the first time.

In speech, an expression is gone the moment it is spoken, and has only that one instant to enter the mind and attain its place in memory. Since classic writing pretends to be speech, it never requires the reader to look forward or backward; it never admits that the reader is in a situation to do so. Each phrase is presented as if it has only one chance — now — to do its job. Of course, a reader may in fact go over a passage of classic prose many times. But the classic writer never acknowledges that possibility either explicitly or by implication.

The ideal speech of classic style appears to be spontaneous and motivated by the need to inform a listener about something. It has just occurred to the speaker to tell someone about this, and so he has begun to do so. Or perhaps he is talking to someone else and is overheard. What he has to say is not a set piece. He has not labored over it beforehand, systematically refining and arranging various thoughts, editing their expression, and then speaking the polished whole aloud. Something occurs to him and he says it. He takes another moment's brief but perfect thought and says the next thing. As a consequence, the rhythm of the writing is a series of movements, each one brief and crisp, with an obvious beginning and end. Of course, in retrospect, we may see that these movements are organized into a flawless global structure, but the pretense is that this global organization is the natural product of the writer's orderly mind. It comes out that way the first time without special effort. The global organization is never referred to; its existence is not even acknowledged. The classic writer thus banishes from his vocabulary phrases like「as we shall see,」「three paragraphs ago,」「before I move to my next point I must introduce a new term,」「the third part of our four-part argument is,」and all other「metadiscourse」that proclaims itself as writing rather than speech.

Pascal's Lettres provinciales are the prototype of this appearance. They are a defense of Jansenism, written in the form of letters from someone in Paris to someone in the provinces. The presentation is informal; the writer is just describing events in the capital. They do not suggest deliberate strategy. It is almost as if the writer had nothing better to do; it occurs to the writer to tell his provincial friend about something everyone in Paris is excited about. It could even be that the writer corresponds with this friend routinely, and that the controversy over Jansenism is merely this season's news. The letters give the appearance of spontaneity: the writer has not sketched out in advance how many letters there will be or what he will write about in each letter. He has not even sketched out the one letter he is writing. The letters do not suggest that they have been edited, either. In this way, classic style has something in common with dramatic performances of talk and conversation. The playwright or screenwriter has edited out everything that is dispensable, but the result is not supposed to sound edited.

The prototypical scene in classic writing is an individual speaking intimately to another individual. What the classic writer has to say is directed entirely to that one individual. But it can be overheard. The reader is sometimes cast in the role of the individual addressed, sometimes cast in the role of eavesdropper. The role of the reader in the Lettres provinciales, for example, is someone who has come across these letters accidentally. These letters imply the participation of their original recipient in a conversation. There is even one short answering letter.

In fact, classic prose is meant to be overheard, because although it is directed entirely toward one individual it never needs to be bent to fit that individual. It is fine if it is overheard, because what it has to say and the way it says it are not contingent upon the audience. It is never dishonorable or problematic. The classic writer does not appear to have written things in a way she would not had she known others were listening.

Classic style is not a style for oratory — in the first place because its model scene is so different from the model scene of oratory. In oratory, the implied author is a rhetor, an actor, adopting a role to speak to an implied audience consisting of a group. The classic writer is not speaking to a group, and although she is of course also an actor, her act is to play at presenting herself. She takes the pose of authenticity. This acting, when good, makes the writer look vulnerable, in the sense that she is exposing what she cares about.

Paradoxically, classic style thus requires a strong revelation of personality even as it subordinates what is merely personal. The classic writer is not interested in mirroring the personal processes of her thought; certainly she is not interested in mirroring her personal sensations or emotions. Yet, since her only motive for speaking is the felt importance of what she has to say, she reveals herself through the topics she chooses and what she says about them.

The model scene of classic prose — an individual speaking to another individual — is not always followed literally from beginning to end. Some texts that appear ostensibly to be based on a different model turn out, on closer inspection, to have been based on the classic model. Let us take as an example the Declaration of Independence. Its beginning and end do not look classic. Its ending is a formulaic speech act, an official declaration of independence with all the appropriate legalistic phrases:

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown. . . .

Speech acts occur between two people informally and intimately all the time, as in「Can you open the door?,」but formal versions of speech acts, like those in the Declaration or「I hereby promise to pay you the amount owed,」are usually reserved for situations where the public audience serves as a witness that the act has been performed. There are no official witnesses to classic prose and no audience with institutional expectations, such as a theater audience, the audience at an inauguration, or the audience at the opening of a bridge.

The ending of the Declaration of Independence is unclassic in another way: its last sentence is a bit of inflated oratory:

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

The beginning of the Declaration of Independence is not classic, either. It announces a scene explicitly removed from the model scene of classic style: it pretends that it is an announcement from a people — the citizens of the colonies — to the whole world:

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

But between the opening and the closing sections of the Declaration, its voice is the voice of one person talking, observing injuries. You can almost see the expression on the face of the speaker, and see his hand gestures as he speaks these words. The speaker wishes to present something to you: the state of things in the colonies, or more specifically in his own life, and why the colonies and he must go their own way. The language is clear and direct and memorable. It is written so as to be understood the first time it is heard. Here are a few examples:

The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. . . .

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. . . .

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

The Declaration of Independence is not one person speaking to another, but in its body it never gets away from that model. The case is similar for sermons, technical reports, lectures, and business memos: the actual scene is not the model scene of classic style, but the writing can be formed upon the classic scene. In fact, not even the prototypical texts of classic style are literally one individual spontaneously speaking to another.

If classic prose is ideal speech, just between us, spontaneous, it follows that its occasions are informal. On the other hand, Johnson on Shakespeare assumes an imaginary protocol between writer and audience in which the occasion is the formal presentation of the writer's labors. It is something like the Mass, whose observers know that its occasion is formal and planned. The protocol of classic prose, by contrast, is spontaneity. It just occurred to the speaker to say this. The informality of the occasion overlaps with the pose of authenticity.

The sense of informality is truer of seventeenth-century French classic style than of its English or American versions. French classic style was at heart a style for memoirs or private reflections. Other occasions — governmental, military, religious, bureaucratic, political — already had their sophisticated protocols, which classic style could not supplant. To some extent in England and to a far greater extent in the United States in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the styles of sermons, political speeches, and other formal presentations were not so immutably established. Classic style in America consequently had the opportunity to take on a use in formal presentations — such as the Declaration of Independence — that it could not have had in its French version.

We can contrast a political text like the Declaration of Independence — whose model scene though not its actual scene is one individual talking to another — with unclassic political speeches such as the typical State of the Union address to Congress or the typical inaugural speech by a governor. There is always a jolt of passion behind the real classic writer, a little excitement because there is a personal conviction and commitment that is often completely missing from a plain statement of what politicians say when they have no intention of acting on it. In the typical State of the Union address, the president of the United States not only can but must speak pieties clearly inconsistent with his actions. Who believes what he is saying? Who thinks he means anything related to action when he says it? In the course of reading the Lettres provinciales, it is possible to believe Pascal is wrong, but it is not possible to believe he is saying something he does not really believe, something he would not act on himself. The classic speaker of the Declaration of Independence is certainly going to act on what he is saying. In fact, his speech is an action, and he is putting his life and fortune at risk by that action. The classic writer is an individual, not the organ of a bureaucracy, and so he says what he believes rather than what a committee has decided it can live with. Classic writers are independent, not concerned to protect members of a bureaucracy. They are not controlled by policy, interests, or an organization, or at least they give no appearance of being controlled in such a fashion. Rid of this baggage, they have a freshness that no utterance cobbled together by committee can ever have. The typical political speech, such as a State of the Union address, cannot say much because it has so many constituencies to worry about. It cannot be written by any individual. It is always the product of a committee, so when it is said or read by the pope or the president or the secretary of lies, it does not sound like an individual speaking. It sounds like what it is: the rumble of bureaucracy.

The classic writer is an individual; his model audience is an individual. The classic writer, therefore, does not make distinctions between members of the audience, saying, for example, that some of them will be better prepared to understand what he has to say than will others, or that some will be interested in the first part and others in the second part. Of course, since he implicitly claims to be talking without having mapped out the global organization, he usually avoids any reference to parts. He also avoids raising any questions about whether the reader is interested in what he has to present, with the result that usually it does not occur to the reader to doubt his own interest.

Prose Is Efficient but Not Rushed

The efficiency of classic style is really a luxury. There are no pressures upon the classic writer. There is the absolute need to present truth about something, but that need, however strongly felt by the classic writer, is not an imposed need. Nothing external manipulates the classic writer, whose motive is neither gain nor reputation. Neither profit nor fear spurs the classic writer's efforts. Nor is there any internal anxiety or ambition. Certainly the clock has no effect upon the classic writer.

We think of efficiency as a weapon against time or as an instrument of productivity. The efficiency expert's job is conceived of as saving money by saving time. Efficiency in these contexts is a competitive trick.

The efficiency of the classic writer is purely a matter of mind. Efficiency in thought is the companion of grace and accuracy, indeed makes them possible. The efficiency of classic prose is the natural product of the classic writer's focused and orderly mind. The classic writer has the luxury of thinking without distraction or pressure. Nothing has the power to hurry the classic writer. Classic prose is thus free of disclaimers that the writer does not have time to do a proper job, or that abbreviations must be made in the interest of time, or that he must skip over something. Indeed, the classic writer seems almost to dwell over a sentence for the slightest moment after it ends, as if to savor it or allow its full impact, before going on to the next sentence.

Classic Style Is Energetic but Not Anxious

Students of martial arts explain that a muscle tensed before performance performs badly, because the tension interferes with the impulse to move. Classic style gives the impression that all of the writer's considerable energy is communicated directly to the writing, with none lost collaterally to anxiety or apprehension. The end of a particularly classic phrase seems to leave its writer in a state of repose out of which the next absolutely efficient movement will come.

If we think of a relaxed state as one free of needless tension but nonetheless fully attentive, then we can say that classic style is relaxed even as it performs, in the way a champion racehorse or sprinter is relaxed even at greatest speed. Inefficient effort is the mark of a neophyte.

1.4.3 场景

一对一说话

古典风格的精髓在于对话有声。古典风格作者采取的姿态是，他说出的话高效得近乎完美，句子声落即定，而不是边写边琢磨。约翰逊写莎士比亚的句子是典型的非古典风格，因为口头说不出来这样的话。古典风格模仿说话场景，一遍就可以准确地大声说出来。

口头的话刚说出来就消失了，只能在那个瞬间被大脑理解和记忆。因为古典风格把写作当说话，从不要求读者来回读；也从不承认读者需要来回读。它假定每次表达只有一次机会一此刻一才能被读到。当然，事实上读者可能会反复翻阅一篇古典文章。但古典风格作者不会声明，也不会默认这种可能性。

理想的古典风格对话看起来是即兴的，因为需要告诉听者什么事情。说话的人刚好想起来要跟某人说这个，于是就说了起来。或者也许是他和别人正说着话，无意中被听到。他不是酝酿着说。他无须事先费心思，先有章法地提炼和组织各种想法，斟酌好措辞，再一语惊人。一些事情浮入脑海，他就说了出来。很快跳入另一个完美的想法，他接着说出下一句。因此，写作的节奏是一系列动作，每个动作干脆利落，有明显的开始和结束。

当然，事后回想，我们会发现这些动作其实是组织得完美无瑕的完整结构，却假装是作者思想有序的自然结果。一想到就是那样，无须多想。作者不会说出这种完整的构思，甚至也不会承认。因此古典风格作者的用词不会出现「正如我们将看到的」「上面三个段落之前」「讲下一个要点之前，我要先介绍一个新词」「我们四段论的第三部分是」等写作才有而非说话必需的「元话语」。

帕斯卡的《致外省人信札》是典型的「假装说话」。这部作品借助一位巴黎人给外省人写信的方式捍卫詹森主义。这是一种非正式的呈现；作者只是描绘都城里发生的事情，看不出来是精心谋划的。就像作者没有别的更好的事情可以做，刚好想到跟一位外省的朋友讲讲每个巴黎人都喜闻乐见的事情一样。甚至可能是作者经常跟这位朋友通信，这季谈到的新闻恰好是对詹森主义的争论而已。这些信看起来是随兴写的，作者先前也没估算过要写多少封信，每封信写什么内容。就连他现在正在写的信，也没事先想好写什么。也看不出来这些信是编辑过的。这样看，古典风格与戏剧表演中的说话和对话有共通之处。剧作家或者编剧已经删掉所有可有可无的内容，但不会让人发现删减痕迹。

古典写作的典型场景是一个人与另一个人亲密交谈。古典风格作者要说的话完全是说给那一个人听的。但别人可能会无意中听到。读者的角色有时是参与对话的人，有时是偷听者。比如《致外省人信札》的读者角色是无意读到这些信的人。这些信暗示最初的收信人参与了对话。甚至附过一封简短的回信。

事实上，古典文章没有提防着被偷听，因为尽管它只对一个人说，也无须迎合那个人。有人偷听也不要紧，因为无论读者是谁，它讲述的内容和方式都不会变。它没有什么不光彩的或难办的。古典风格作者不会表现出这样的态度：要知道还有别人在听，他就不这么写了。

古典风格不适合用来演说 —— 首先，因为古典风格的典型场景跟演说风格的典型场景差别很大。演说风格默认作者擅长修辞和表演，默认听众对象是一群人。古典风格作者不是跟一群人讲话，虽然他自己当然也是一位演员，但他表演的是呈现自己。他的姿态是事实就是如此。这种表演，若演得好，会让作者看起来处于弱势，因为他在暴露自己关心的东西。

因此古典风格要求坦露自己的个性，但自相矛盾的是，个性纯属个人化的特质。古典风格作者的兴趣不在于表现他个人的思路过程；当然，也不在于表现他个人的感受和情绪。因为他说话的唯一动机是他觉得他要说的话很重要，所以他选择的话题和讲的内容揭露了自己。

① 此处的第三人称代词原为 she，本书多处用表示女性的「she」泛指作者或读者，但也有用表示男性的「he」泛指作者或读者，根据目前的通行程度，汉译文均统一为「他」，泛指作者或读者。—— 译者注

古典文章的典型场景 —— 一个人与另一个人说话 —— 并非总是从头到尾贯穿整篇文章。一些文本表面上看是别的风格，仔细看原来是古典风格。以《独立宣言》为例，它的开头和结尾看不出来是古典风格。它的结构是一种程式化言语行为，用恰当的法律用语发表官方独立宣言：

因此，我们这些在国会集会的美利坚合众国的代表们，吁请世界的最高裁判来判断我们这些意图的正义性。我们以这些殖民地的善良人民的名义并根据他们的授权，庄严地公告和宣布：这些联合殖民地现在是，并且按照法律应该是自由和独立的国家：他们解除了对英国王室的一切效忠…...

两个人的交谈总是非正式的亲密行为，比如「你能开门吗？」，但正式的言语行为，如《独立宣言》中的句子或「我在此承诺向你足额支付欠款」，一般专用于特定的场合，而听众作为见证人见证该行为被执行。古典文章没有官方见证人，也没有带着世俗期望的观众，比如，剧院、就职典礼或大桥落成仪式上的观众。

《独立宣言》的结尾不是古典风格还表现在：它的最后一句话有种演说的高调。

为了拥护本宣言，我们怀着对神圣上帝保佑之坚定信心，谨以我们的生命、财产和神圣的名誉互相发誓。

《独立宣言》的开头也不是古典风格。它表现的场景明显不属于古典风格的典型场景：它假装这是一个民族 —— 殖民地全体公民 —— 向全世界的宣告。

在人类事件的进程中，当一个民族有必要解除一直把它与另一个民族连接起来的政治桎梏，并且在世界列国中确认由自然的法律和自然的上帝的法律所赋予他们的独立平等地位时，对人类公意的真诚尊重要求他们宣布迫使他们独立的理由。

但是在宣言开头与结尾之间的部分，它的声音是一个人观察伤口时说话的声音。你几乎可以看到演讲者脸上的表情，看到他说这些话时做的手势。演讲者希望向你展示一些东西：殖民地事务的现状，或者具体到他个人生活事务的现状，以及为什么殖民地和他个人必须找到各自的发展道路。所用语言清晰、直接、易记，读者听一遍就能懂。比如下面几个例子：

当今大不列颜国王的历史，就是一部怙恶不悛、倒行逆施的历史。他的一切行为的直接目的，就是在我们这些殖民地建立一种绝对的专制统治…...

他把各州的立法团体召集到特别的、不便利的和远离政府档案库的地方去开会，因为其唯一的目的，就是使那些立法机关疲于奔命，以服从他的指使…...

他掠夺我们的海上船舶，骚扰我们的沿海地区，焚毁我们的城市，残害我们人民的生命。

他强迫我们那些在公海被俘的同胞武装起来反对自己的国家，充当屠杀其兄弟和朋友的剑子手，或者死于其兄弟和朋友之手。

《独立宣言》不是一个人与另一个人对话，但它的中间部分从未脱离这种模式。这种场合与布道、技术报告、讲座和商业备忘录的场合类似：实际场景不是古典风格的典型场景，但写作可以构建在古典场景上。事实上，甚至典型的古典风格文本，也不完全是一个人与另一个人的即兴对话。

如果古典文章是理想对话，仅是你和我之间即兴的交流，那么它的场合是非正式的。不同的是，约翰逊写莎士比亚戏剧集序言时，假定作者与读者之间存在一种假想协议：这是正式场合，要呈现作者的苦心弧指。它类似做弥散，它的观察者知道它是精心安排的正式场合。相反，古典文章的协议是即兴。作者想到就说了。这种场合的非正式性与此乃事实的姿态有共通之处。

相比英美的古典风格，这种非正式感在十七世纪法国的古典风格中尤为明显。法国古典风格本质上是一种回忆录或个人回忆的风格。别的一些场合，比如政府、军事、宗教、官僚、政治上的场合，已经有各自成熟的协议，非古典风格能取代。某种程度上对十七、十八世纪的英国来说，尤其是对美国，布道、政治讲话及其他正式陈述的风格还未建立不可撼动的地位。因此在美国，古典风格有机会用于正式发言 —— 比如《独立宣言》—— 但在法国不可能出现类似的古典风格宣言。

我们可以比较古典风格与非古典风格的政治文本，前者以《独立宣言》为例，典型场景（虽不是实际场景）是一个人与另一个人的对话，后者以典型的国会国情咨文讲话或典型的州长就职演讲为例。真正的古典风格作者总是藏着一股激情，透露些许兴奋，因为他们怀着个人的信念和承诺，这些情感在光说不做的政治家那里是缺失的。在典型的国情咨文演讲中，美国总统会说一些明显言行不一的大话，而且是必须要说的。谁相信他说的话？谁认为他会有心践行他说的话？读《致外省人信札》的过程中，你可能认为帕斯卡错了，但不会认为他说的话，是他自己都无法相信也无法践行的。

《独立宣言》的古典风格发言人当然会践行他自己说的话。事实上，他的演讲就是一种行动，这种行动将他的生命和命运置于危险之中。古典风格作者代表的是个人，而不是官僚机构，所以他说的是自己相信的，而不是委员会一致决定折中的事情。古典风格作者是独立的个人，不必担心要保护官僚机构的人。他们不会受政策、利益或组织的摆布，或者至少不会表现出受了某种方式摆布。因为不用背负这种压力，所以他们说话有一种即兴的热情，委员会东拼西凑的发言不可能有这样的热情。典型的政治演讲，比如国情咨文演讲，不能讲太多，因为要照顾到不同选区。任何个人写不出来这样的文章。它总是某个委员会共同权衡出来的结果，所以当教皇或总统或满口谎言的秘书说或读的时候，听起来不像个体发言，而像它本来的样子 —— 官僚机构的低声议论。

古典风格作者是独立的个体；他的典型读者也是独立的个体。所以古典风格作者不会划分不同的读者，比如有些读者比别人更愿意理解他说的话，或者一些读者对第一部分感兴趣，另一些读者对第二部分更感兴趣。当然，因为他默认的主张是，说话不会提前酝酿完整的结构，所以一般他不提某些单独的部分。他也不会问读者是否对他说的话感兴趣，通常读者也没想到自己是否感兴趣。

高效但不仓促

古典风格的效率确实是一种奢侈。古典风格作者没有压力。毋庸置疑，呈现事情真相是一种绝对的必要，但无论古典风格作者觉得多么急迫，这都不会是一种强制要求。没有什么外在的东西可以操控古典风格作者，他的动机非名亦非利。利益和恐惧都不能激发古典风格作者的创作。他也没有什么内在的焦虑或野心。自然，古典风格作者也不受时间限制。

我们把效率看作抢夺时间的武器，或是提高生产力的工具。效率专家的工作是省时省钱。这类效率是一种竞争手段。

古典风格作者的效率只是思想问题。思想的效率与优雅、准确并行，效率达不到，也很难达到优雅、准确。古典风格作者的思想专注而清晰，自然能写出高效的古典文章。古典风格作者可以随兴思考，没有干扰，没有压力。没有什么东西能催促古典风格作者。因此，古典文章没有免责声明，比如作者有充分的时间可以做得更好，或者因为时间有限只好缩减或只能略掉某些内容。其实古典风格作者写完一句话后会稍做停留，就好像要细品这句话的余韵，接着才写下一句。

专注但不紧张

武术表演的学生说，表演前如果肌肉太紧张，就发挥不好，因为紧张就无法蓄势而发。古典风格给人的印象是，作者的绝大部分能量直接用于写作，不会消耗任何能量在焦虑或恐惧上。古典风格作者写完一句非常古典的话后，会沉浸到一种安宁的状态，由此开始下一个绝对高效的动作。

如果我们将放松的状态理解为不过度紧张但仍全神贯注，那么我们可以说，古典风格在表演时也是放松的，就像一流的赛马或短跑运动员在一种放松的状态中全速奔跑。低效努力是初学者的标志。

#### 1.4.4 Cast

Elite Is Not Exclusive

Classic style rests on an implied view of human nature that finds echoes in many religious traditions: left to themselves, people are sure to get things wrong; but with effort and discipline anyone can get the essential things right. Are the saints an elite? Of course. But sanctity, unlike, say, noble birth, is accessible to anyone who is willing to make the effort. So it is with classic style. The elitism of classic style is not the result of natural endowment. It is the result of effort and discipline ending in achievement. No one willing to make the effort is excluded from joining this elite.

The elitism of classic style has nothing to do with the object of presentation, which can range from fine wines to deep sewer tunnels. It has nothing to do with the connoisseurship of the writer either. The writer may speak with a technical mastery not possessed by the reader, but his attitude is always that the reader lacks this mastery only accidentally. You could know what he knows, and you would if you were standing where he stands, which is where the classic writer is trying to place you.

Classic Style Is for Everybody

Imagine someone sitting down to study the works of Marcel Proust, or Ezra Pound, or Walt Whitman with a view to learning to write as they did. It seems absurd, the ambition of a crackpot who does not have the first clue about style. Imagine trying to learn to write like Coleridge, Poe, Faulkner, or Baudelaire. These writers' styles are so suffused with their personalities and have been forged in pursuit of such specific and idiosyncratic goals that no one can acquire their styles short of becoming the writers in question and adopting their goals. The attempt obviously cannot succeed and if pursued to the end results in grotesque impersonation expressed as unconscious parody.

Classic style, by contrast, was assembled out of attitudes and techniques that are available to everybody and independent of any specific subject. There is a definite and knowable path to learning classic style, and you can acquire it fully. When you do, it is yours. The classic writer is impersonating no one. On the contrary, although the classic writer has learned a style instead of having invented one, his attitudes and techniques are authentic to himself. The writer is not appropriated by the style. It is possible to distinguish at a glance between Pascal, Descartes, and La Rochefoucauld. But unlike idiosyncratic styles, classic style is not shaped by the details of a writer's personality or the details of his subject. Neither is it a medium specifically designed to receive the imprint of a whole personality in all of its mysterious individuality. The project of a writer such as Proust, inseparable as it is from the details of his personality, is not a classic project. One consequence of his success in creating a style that answers his needs so well is that his style cannot usefully be adopted to anyone else's.

The Reader Is Competent

Classic style is modeled not merely on speech but on the core concept of conversation — conversation between equals. There is an implicit symmetry in the relationship between the writer and the reader. The model assumes that the reader could take the next turn in the conversation.

Those who have made the effort to acquire classic style comprise, then, a complementary cast of competent writers and competent readers. Becoming competent in this sense consists in being dispassionate enough to see things straight and to present what you have seen without the special pleading of someone whose interests affect her judgments. Such「competence」will seem illusory to many. Can anyone ever see things straight? Can anyone present what she has seen without her interests affecting her judgments? Classic style rests on the enabling assumption that the answers to these questions are yes and yes. When doubt about whether anyone can actually see anything straight and doubt about whether anyone can present what she sees without the distortion of special pleading suffuses a writer's style, that style cannot be classic.

The writer and the reader achieve their competence in the same way. The writer may know something that the reader does not, but the reader has access, in principle, to the same source of knowledge that serves the writer. There is a tacit reference to a shared standard that creates a symmetrical relationship between the writer and the reader. The duc de La Rochefoucauld's description of Madame de Chevreuse rests on this sort of tacit reference. La Rochefoucauld knew her; his readers do not, yet there is an almost irresistible conviction to his description. That conviction rests on the unspoken premise that if we knew her, we would notice what the writer noticed. The writer takes no credit for noticing just these things, and contrasting them in just this way. His unspoken claim is that it would be altogether peculiar not to notice these things and contrast them in this way.

We can see something of this deep conviction that all competent people observe the same things in a passage from Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennet and her sister Jane are discussing Charlotte Lucas's marriage to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth says that she is scandalized at her friend Charlotte's marriage to a man for whom no right-thinking woman could possibly have any regard. Jane replies that, in forming this judgment, Elizabeth has not「made allowance enough for difference in situation and temper.」Here is part of Elizabeth's answer

[W]ere I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.

If Elizabeth thought that situation and temper could make a difference in how someone judges Mr. Collins, it would destroy her ability to talk freely to Jane. She would be obliged to hold back her judgments, and that would necessarily alter the whole style of their relationship. Charlotte's decision to marry Mr. Collins has altered forever her relationship to Elizabeth because they can no longer be open and truthful to one another. Jane has seen the same things Elizabeth has seen and they judge Mr. Collins by the same standards, so in the absence of incompetence or special pleading, they must reach the same conclusions.

This assumed symmetry between writer and reader saves the prototypical classic writer from appearing to stoop to mere grinding persuasion. The classic writer does not have to persuade the reader. All he has to do is offer the reader an unobstructed view, and of course the reader will see. This is the stance, for example, of the Declaration of Independence and of Pascal's Lettres provinciales: any reasonable person not corrupted by interest would have to agree; their writers are not arguing, they are presenting. As the Declaration puts it,「To prove [that the King is a Tyrant], let Facts be submitted to a candid world.」The Declaration then lists facts, as if the conclusion to be drawn from them is evident to anyone who has「a proper way of thinking.」

The relationship between writer and reader in classic style is based on an unspecified set of perceptions and values held in common. When a writer makes a decision, it is presented as if it is a decision that the reader is equally capable of making. The silent convention is that a competent reader who had seen the evidence would have made the same decision. The reader does not have to regard the writer as having superior judgment or having access to information not independently available to the reader.

Here is the New Testament scholar C. H. Dodd explaining why he has rejected the idea of rearranging the textual materials of the Fourth Gospel before undertaking a detailed interpretation of the text:

Many attempts have been made to improve the work by rearrangement of its material. Some of these have been (as it were) canonized by being adopted in large and important editions of the Fourth Gospel, and in modern translations. I have examined several of these rearrangements, and cannot sufficiently admire the patience and endless ingenuity which have gone into their making. It is of course impossible to deny that the work may have suffered dislocation, and plausible grounds may be alleged for lifting certain passages out of their setting, where there seems to be some prima facie breach of continuity. Unfortunately, when once the gospel has been taken to pieces, its reassemblage is liable to be affected by individual preferences, preconceptions and even prejudices. Meanwhile the work lies before us in an order which (apart from insignificant details) does not vary in the textual tradition, traceable to an early period. I conceive it to be the duty of an interpreter at least to see what can be done with the document as it has come down to us before attempting to improve upon it. This is what I shall try to do. I shall assume as a provisional working hypothesis that the present order is not fortuitous, but deliberately devised by somebody — even if it were only a scribe doing his best — and that the person in question (whether the author or another) had some design in mind, and was not necessarily irresponsible or unintelligent. If the attempt to discover any intelligible thread of argument should fail, then we may be compelled to confess that we do not know how the work was originally intended to run. If on the other hand it should appear that the structure of the gospel as we have it has been shaped in most of its details by the ideas which seem to dominate the author's thoughts, then it would appear not improbable that we have his work before us substantially in the form which he designed.

In making his decision, Dodd takes the position that the reader, once the essential evidence has been assembled, will see precisely what he does. Even though scholarly editors of「large and important editions of the Fourth Gospel」have made a different decision, it requires only a disinterested review of evidence that is in principle accessible to anyone who might care to examine it to allow the reader to see not merely why Dodd has chosen not to rearrange the textual materials of the gospel but why anyone not positively perverse or whose judgment is not affected by personal preferences, preoccupations, or prejudice would do the same thing. In his presentation, his decision is not the product of his exceptional insight, or special knowledge, or personal experience. It has nothing to do with his situation or temper. Provided he is right when he says that the work「(apart from insignificant details) does not vary in the textual tradition, traceable to an early period」 — something that can presumably be verified — his decision can be confirmed by anyone who wishes to undertake the investigation he has. There is a silent assumption that part of the reader's competence consists in his agreeing with the writer about what can serve as a proper investigation of this point. It does not affect this attitude in the least if the reader of this passage has, let us say, no knowledge of Hellenistic Greek, no experience with textual materials of this sort, and has never even heard of the large and important editions of the Fourth Gospel that have patiently and ingeniously rearranged the text. All this is merely information, which, in principle, anyone can acquire in just the same way Dodd himself acquired it.

This sense of shared competence is characteristic of the relationship between writer and reader in classic style. There is always a tacit appeal to a standard of perception and judgment that is assumed to be general, rather than special. There is no need for the writer to make appeals to his sincerity, for example, or to some special insight or competence, to arcane or technical knowledge, or to a lifetime of experience obviously not available to everyone else.

Consider how different this attitude is from one in which the author speaks to the reader from an assumed position of superiority.「Reader, you think that high unemployment is bad for an economy because you don't know the first thing about economics; you think that light makes the retina transmit signals because you can't tell the difference between old wives' tales and biochemistry; you think that authors write texts because you don't know the difference between literature and textual modes of domination; you think marriage is normal because you've been taken in by a repressive society. You're lucky you picked up this book, my friend, because you need help. You need it bad.」The classic symmetry between writer and reader is broken whenever the writer presents distinctions as if they are the product of her own exceptional insight or temper, distinctions the reader could not have been trusted to see on his own in the right circumstances.

It is broken in a different but complementary way when the writer speaks as if from a knowledge of facts that is, in principle, private. The narrator of Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu breaks the classic symmetry between writer and reader in just this way. He dips a kind of cookie called a madeleine into a cup of tea, tastes it, and has his past come flooding into his memory in hallucinatory detail. The reader of this passage normally has no inclination to doubt the truth of what the narrator says, but neither can the reader verify it by furnishing himself with tea and madeleines of his own. There are all sorts of rhetorical inducements to believe the narrator, but then, you just have to believe him. You cannot see what he sees, and your exclusion is not accidental, as it is when a writer presents events he saw in the 1930s or conversation she heard at the court of Henri IV. Instead, you are in principle excluded from ever being able to verify the narrator's experience.

In「What Is an Author?」Michel Foucault defines a relationship between writer and reader that is asymmetric in both ways: he appeals tacitly to both his own superior judgment and private evidence. In his essay, Foucault observes that before Mallarmé, the concept「literary work」has a kind of validity that it does not have afterward because it is supplanted by「textual modes of domination.」There may be reasons to accept what Foucault says, but it is not presented as the sort of observation that a reader can confirm by examining evidence that is, in principle, accessible to anyone who cares to look at it. It is extraordinary really that no one before Foucault seems to have noticed this remarkable rupture in the history of literature. Foucault does not address the point, but if a reader were to pursue it and ask how it came about that something so fundamental had never before been noticed, the answer has two related but distinct parts. First, Foucault's ability to see what others have not is a consequence of his superior competence. Second, that superior competence defines the relevant evidence. That is why Foucault cannot point his reader to the evidence on which he has reached his conclusion in the way Dodd can. The competence needed to confirm Dodd by reviewing his evidence would take most of a lifetime to acquire — the linguistic, historical, and technical knowledge needed to conduct an investigation of the manuscript tradition of the Fourth Gospel and a critical review of the decisions made by its modern editors — but hundreds of people have acquired such competence and anyone who wants to is, in principle, free to do so. Foucault's evidence is difficult of access not merely because it requires competence that most people do not have and in practice cannot acquire; on the contrary, it is, in principle, private. You would need Foucault's superior insight even to realize that his evidence is evidence: it is, after all, exactly what everyone else since Mallarmé has been looking at without being able to realize that it is evidence for a historical discontinuity between literary works and textual modes of domination.

A reader can accept the idea that Foucault has superior competence, but the reader does not and cannot share that superior competence and, as a result, cannot share his perception either. He can merely be told about it. In classic prose, the relationship between writer and reader is never asymmetrical in this way because classic style appeals to a standard of perception and of judgment assumed to be general, rather than special.

The Writer Is Authentic

The classic writer stands fully behind what she has to say because she has thought it out independently. It may be that in thinking something out independently she has come to a common conclusion, but in expressing it she is neither joining a chorus nor embracing a platitude. Her conclusion is the product of her own thought. As a consequence, even when a classic writer reaches a common conclusion, it has the freshness of discovery. It does not come from camaraderie or conformity. She does not expect its common acceptance to be the evidence that causes it to be believed. It is possible to repeat clichés or say what you think you must to get people to believe you, but the classic stylist appears to have nothing to do with these activities.

It is not the accumulated acceptance of other people — even if these other people are right — that gives force to classic writing. It is the writer's conviction that she has earned a conclusion. To convince another competent person of what is being said does not involve appeals to authority or traditional wisdom or anything other than a simple presentation of the order of reason leading to that conclusion, so that someone else can also reach it independently.

This sort of thing happens every day. When a high school geometry student proves the Pythagorean theorem, she is not breaking new ground in mathematics. But if she has actually worked out the proof herself, she — not Pythagoras — stands behind the theorem. She can respond to any possible challenge by presenting her authentically personal — even if quite common — proof. Someone who copies the identical proof without understanding it cannot stand behind it. Under challenge, the inauthentic geometer has nothing better to offer than lame appeals to widespread acceptance:「Every geometry book since Euclid says this theorem is true, so it must be.」

The Writer Is Sufficient

The classic writer perceives truth and, as a corollary, enjoys a uniquely open and incomparably full communication with the society of other people who perceive truth. It would be inaccurate to say that there is absolutely nothing the writer wants from the reader, because the writer does indeed want the reader to belong to that society as well, so much so that he treats the reader as someone who is already a member.

But there is nothing else the classic writer wants from the reader, and nothing at all that the classic writer needs from the reader: the classic writer will present truth without distortion or special pleading even if there is, in fact, no competent reader available.

Above all, the classic writer never appears to be pursuing self-interest. There is nothing the classic writer needs, and so there is nothing the classic writer is trying to get from the reader.

The Writer Is Competent

It is paralyzing to think of how many things can go wrong in an attempt to present something clearly and accurately. Perhaps you cannot see straight. Perhaps you cannot express what you see. Perhaps your conceptual instruments are dull. You might have disabling gaps in your knowledge. You might be lying to yourself.

The situation is not much better even if you have no fears about these potential sources of impotence, because the reader might have doubts, and then you have a different problem: how do you deal with the doubts of the reader?

It is enough to stop some people from writing. Even worse, from the classic point of view, it is enough to convince some people that they should allow their doubts about their own problematic situation as writers to supplant all other subjects, since these doubts are the only things that seem certain.

Classic style frees writers from anxiety or silence by making the enabling assumption that the writer is competent. Truth, which is available to all, can be seen and presented by this writer. Such a competence is no more impossible or problematic than the competence of quite ordinary high school students to prove the Pythagorean theorem. A writer does not have to be omniscient; he just needs an everyday form of competence — the competence of knowing what he needs to know for this talk. His mind is in order and his facts are straight.

The result of this enabling convention is prose that is unclotted and that stays on track. In reality, all the doubts surrounding any writer's situation remain. Both writer and reader know them, so it is merely tedious to rehearse them. There is something at least mildly fraudulent about offering to present a subject and then substituting for it the problematic nature of the presentation.「Let me tell you how to make bread pudding. My God, have you any idea of how impossible it is actually to explain how to cook in writing? I can make bread pudding myself — done it a hundred times — but it's impossible to put into words how to know when you've got the right consistency. . . .」

The enabling convention that the writer is competent goes hand in hand with the absence of hedges in classic prose. There are styles of academic, legal, and business prose in which the motive is to ensure that no challenge can be raised that has not already been acknowledged by the writer, so that the writer is「covered.」Some of these challenges concern the activities of thinking and presenting. Writers in these styles typically work hard to demonstrate that they have anticipated challenges: Could the writer have been deluded by his prejudices? Could there be crucial missing facts? Could the writer's language be radically and irresolvably ambiguous, even self-defeating?

These anticipations are largely pointless, because it is usually impossible to prove a negative (「No, it is in principle impossible that I could be deluded by prejudice,」「No, there could be no crucial missing fact,」「No, there could be no reader, however perverse, able to misunderstand what I am saying」). Classic style sees nothing to be accomplished by rehearsing these questions, and so eliminates them from the outset.

This enabling convention is made to save writer and reader from spinning their wheels on uncertain ground to no possible effect, but it is not made to constrain the reader's belief. The writer speaks with confidence, and this can be compelling; but the reader will bring his full competence to bear and will make his own judgment about whether the writer is right or wrong. The reader may conclude that a text is masterful, classic, and completely wrong. In classic prose, the writer takes the pose of competence so as not to waste our time with distractions as he presents those things that allow us to decide whether he really is competent.

The Writer Does All the Work Invisibly

Suggestion is powerful, since people believe a conclusion more readily if they think they have helped to reach it or have reached it themselves.

A catalogue of styles of suggestion would be long and varied. It would range from subliminal suggestion, in which the writer tries to give the reader all the credit by hiding the suggestion, to what we will call domestic moral suggestion, which consists of posing a problem, garnished with appropriate facts, as if you cannot see what to do, in the hope that the slow-witted spouse, sibling, child, or parent addressed will recognize his duty and get on with it. There are poetic styles of suggestion, as in haiku, in which luminous details are juxtaposed so as to launch the reader toward a perception that is never stated. There are mystic styles, which view truth as something that can be hinted at but never grasped intellectually or expressed accurately. There is participatory suggestion, in which the speaker as if by chance arrays all the right details and begins to grope toward a conclusion but has difficulty and turns to the reader to work out the rest. There is lotus-eater suggestion, which consists of some ill-formed attempts, combined with a few gestures, and closed off with the lame,「You know what I mean.」

Classic style is not a style of suggestion. All necessary refinements have been made and are accurately expressed.

There are other styles in which the writer does all the work, but he does it under the reader's nose:「And now I think I need some decorative ornament with which to finish this off, a finial of some sort, so to make that I will have to fire up the lathe, and get the right piece of wood; let's see, this one won't do, it has a crack; we need one that has just the right grain; yes, here, now we mount this on the lathe. . . .」The classic writer, by contrast, does all the work invisibly. She pulls the finished finial out of her pocket. The classic writer is not like a television cook showing you how to mix mustard and balsamic vinegar. She is like a chef whose work is presented to you at table but whose labor you are never allowed to see, a labor the chef certainly does not expect you to share. There are no salt and pepper shakers on your table.

1.4.4 角色

人人可成为精英

与许多宗教传统不谋而合，古典风格基于一条没有言明的人性观点：放任不管，人肯定会犯错，但经过努力和训练，任何人都能做对基础的事情。圣人是精英吗？当然。但神圣跟生来高贵不同，只要愿意努力，任何人都可以成为圣人。古典风格也是如此。古典风格的精英主义并非出于本能，而是努力与训练终有所得的结果。一个愿意努力的人，不会被古典风格精英拒之门外。

古典风格的精英主义与呈现什么无关，从精致的葡萄酒到阴森的下水道都可以呈现。这与作者的鉴赏力也无关。作者讲述的口吻可能是他掌握了读者不会的专业知识，但他的态度始终是，读者只是因为偶然原因才没有掌握。你可以知道他知道的，而且自然会知道，只要你站在他所在的位置，这正是古典风格作者努力让你身处其中的地方。

人人可学会古典风格

想象一个人坐下来研究马尔塞·普鲁特斯（Marcel Proust）或者埃兹拉·庞德（Ezra Pound）或者沃尔特·惠特曼（Walt Whitman）的作品，为了学习像他们一样写作。这看起来很荒谬，像一个完全不懂风格的人幻想着成为大师。想象一下，尝试学着像柯勒律治（coleridge）、爱伦坡（Poe）、福克纳（Faulkner）或波德莱尔（Baudelaire）一样写作。这些作家的风格个性鲜明，由于追求一些特别且怪诞的目标形成了独特的风格，没人能学会他们的风格，除非成为他们那样的作家，并设立他们那样的目标。这种尝试显然不会成功，如果非要坚持，模仿怪诞不成，还变成一种无意识的滑稽。

相比之下，古典风格的技能和态度，每个人都能学会，且与主题无关。学习古典风格有确切可知的路径，而且你完全可以掌握这种风格。只要你学会了，它就是你自己的风格。古典风格作者不用模仿任何人。相反，虽然古典风格作者是学会一种风格，而不是发明一种风格，但他的态度和技巧仍属于他自己。作者不会隐没于古典风格之下。帕斯卡、笛卡儿和拉罗什福科的文章一眼就能区分出来。与怪诞风格不同，古典风格不是由作者的人格特征或它的主题细节决定的。它也不是专为表达作者的神秘个性及其背后的完整人格的某种媒介。像普鲁斯特这类作家的作品，因为与他的个性特点密不可分，不属于古典风格。他创造的风格如此独到，以至于只能满足自己的需要，而无法适用于任何其他人。

读者可以胜任

古典风格不仅模仿说话的方式，而且模仿对话的核心理念 —— 平等对话。作者和读者之间有一种隐含的对等关系。这种模式假定对话时读者可以应答。

那些努力追求古典风格的人，可以说由一组互补角色构成，即胜任的作者和胜任的读者。这里的胜任在于能够客观公正地看清事物、呈现事物，不受任何人的利益影响。这种「胜任」对许多人来说似乎不切实际。人真的能够看清事物吗？人真的能不受利益驱使客观地呈现所见之物吗？对两个问题的肯定回答是古典风格依存的基础假设。如果一位作者的风格总是怀疑人是否真的能看清事物，以及人是否能放下一己私利客观呈现所见之物，那肯定不是古典风格。

作者和读者胜任古典风格的方式是一样的。作者可能知道读者不知道的东西，但原则上，为作者所用的知识来源可以同样为读者所用。默认参照的是共同标准，这种标准为作者与读者建立起一种对等关系。拉罗什福科描述谢弗勒兹夫人就有这种默认参照。拉罗什福科知道她，他的读者不知道。但他的描述有一种几乎不容置疑的坚定。这种坚定源于一条隐含前提：如果我们知道她，作者注意到的我们也会注意到。虽然作者注意到这些东西并用这种方式对比，但他没有归为自己的功劳。他的潜台词是，没注意到这些东西、没用这样的方式对比，才令人奇怪。

我们可以从《傲慢与偏见》的一段话中看到这种坚定，即所有胜任的人都能观察到同样的事物。伊丽莎白·班纳特和她的妹妹简正在讨论夏洛特·卢卡斯嫁给柯林斯先生这件事。伊丽莎白说，她很气愤，她没想到她的朋友夏洛特会嫁给一个这样的男人，凡是头脑正常的女人都不会看得起的男人。简回应说，伊丽莎白做出这一判断时没有「充分考虑到处境和性情的差别」。伊丽莎白对此的部分回答如下：

假如让我相信夏洛特当真爱上了柯林斯，那我就觉得她不仅没有情感，而且还缺乏理智。亲爱的简，柯林斯先生是个自高自大、心胸狭窄的蠢汉，这一点你跟我一样清楚。你还会跟我一样感到，哪个女人肯嫁给他，一定是头脑糊涂。虽说这个女人就是夏洛特·卢卡斯，你也不要为她辩护。你不能为了某一个人而改变原则和准绳，也不要试图说服我或你自己，认为自私自利就是谨慎，胆大妄为就能确保幸福。① 10

① 汉语翻译选自孙致礼译本。—— 译者注

如果伊丽莎白认为这种处境和性情会影响一个人对柯林斯先生的评价，她就无法与简自由交流。她只会对自己的看法闭口不谈，这必定会改变她俩关系的整体风格。夏洛特嫁给柯林斯先生的决定永远改变了她与伊丽莎白的关系，因为她们再也不能坦诚相待。伊丽莎白看到的事情简同样看到了，她们评判柯林斯先生的标准也一样，所以如果不是无法胜任，也不是受了一己私利的蒙蔽，她们肯定会得出同样的结论。

因为作者与读者这种假定的对等关系，典型的古典风格作者不至于看起来据理力争。古典风格作者不必说服读者。他只需为读者提供一处没有障碍的视角，读者自然会看到。这就是《独立宣言》和帕斯卡的《致外省人信札》的立场：任何理智的、未被利欲熏心的人都会认同；它们的作者不辩解，只呈现。正如《独立宣言》中的一句话，「为了证明这一点（大不列颠国王是暴君），特向公正的世人陈述以下事实。」接着《独立宣言》列出事实，好像结论是显然的，凡能「正确思考」的人都看得出来。

古典风格中作者与读者之间的关系，基于他们都具备某些洞察力和价值观。当作者做出某个决定时，就好像读者也有能力做出同样的决定。不成文的规定是，一位胜任的读者如果看到证据会做出同样的决定。读者不用觉得，作者的判断高人一等，或掌握着读者无法获取的信息。

新约学者 C. H. 多德（C.H.Dodd）这样解释为什么没做文本解读时不会考虑重新编排第四部福音书的文本材料：

为改善第四部福音书的文本，人们已经做了很多重新编排工作。有一些（可以说是）已经奉为经典，被用作第四部福音书的重大版本和现代翻译版本。我查过几个重新编排的版本，由衷敬佩他们编排时的耐心和无尽才思。当然无法否认，编排工作会出现错乱，某个位置的内容，乍看起来破坏了原文的连贯性，移到别的位置或许看起来有它的道理。不幸的是，一旦福音书被拆解得支离破碎，重新编排很容易受个人偏好、先入之见甚至偏见影响。对比之下，我们前人编排福音书的顺序（除了不重要的细节外）沿袭了同样的文本传统，可以追溯到早期。我认为这是解读者的职责：试着改善原文本之前，至少先看看这些传承至今的材料能怎么用。这是我会努力做的事情。我会先假定一个初步设想，现在的顺序不是随意编排的，而是有人用心构思过 —— 哪怕只是一个抄写员尽自已的职责 —— 而且负责编排的人（无论作者还是其他人）心里有自己的设计，并不一定就是不负责或不聪明。如果我们没有找到论述的脉络，我们就不得不承认我们不知道原作最初的意图是什么。另一方面，如果现行版福音书的结构编排在大部分细节上尽量靠近作者的主要思想，他的作品延续至今仍大体上保持他最初的设计形式也不无可能。11

多德做出这项决定的立场是，读者一旦收集到必要的证据，就会确切地看到他做的事情。虽然一些博学的编辑在编排第四部福音书「重大版本」上做了不同的决定，但只要读者客观地复查证据 —— 原则上任何有心核查证据的人都能查到 —— 不仅会明白为什么多德选择拒绝重新编排福音书的文本材料，也会明白凡是不故意违背常理的人，凡是不让个人偏好、先入之见或偏见影响自己判断的人，都会做出同样的选择。正如他讲的，他的决定并非源自他过人的远见、特殊的学识，或个人的经验。这与他的处境或性情没有关系。假设下面这句话他说对了，「（除了不重要的细节外）沿袭了同样的文本传统，可以追溯到早期」—— 想必这是可以验证的信息 —— 任何愿意做他那样调查研究的人都会做出同样的决定。这里隐含着一种假设：读者的部分能力表现在，像作者一样知道什么样的调查研究够分量。哪怕这篇文章的读者，比如不懂古希腊语，没有处理这类文本材料的经验，甚至都没听说过第四部福音书有一个经过耐心而巧妙的重新编排的重大版本。所有这些都只是信息，原则上，任何人都可以用多德那样的方式获取这些信息。

同等胜任感是古典风格作者与读者的关系特点。一直以来，观察和判断默认诉诸普遍标准而非特殊标准。作者没必要诉诸一些别人无法求证的东西，比如他的虔诚、某些特别的洞见或能力、晦涩或专业的知识或毕生的经验。

想想与作者的自我优越感相比，这两种态度多么不同。「读者，你认为失业率太高对经济不利，因为你不懂经济的利害关系；你认为光线使视网膜传输信号，因为你分不清什么是老妇人的离奇故事，什么是生物化学；你认为作者的工作是写文字材料，因为你不知道文学和主要文本形式之间的区别；你认为缔结婚姻很正常，因为你受了专制社会的蒙骗。你能遇到这本书是你的幸运，我的朋友，因为你需要帮助，太需要了。」一旦作者表现得好像只有具备他那样超凡脱俗的洞见或性情，才能发现这些区别，而读者不管在什么样的位置都不可能自己看到，作者与读者之间的古典对等关系就会被打破。

另一种不同但互补的方式，也会破坏这种关系，那就是作者说的事实依据基本上源于个人。普鲁斯特《追忆似水年华》（A la recherche du temps perdu）这本书中的叙述者就是用这种方式破坏了作者与读者的古典对等关系。他用一种马德琳（madeleines）饼干蘸茶吃时，过往的记忆像潮水般涌出，虚幻又真切。读这篇文章的人一般想不到要怀疑叙述者所言是真是假，也不能自己用马德琳饼干蘸茶吃来验证。叙述者可以借用各种修辞手法诱使别人相信他，但那样，你也只能相信他而已。你看不见他看到的东西，这不是偶然，因为他说的好像是，他在 20 世纪 30 年代看到的事情，或者他在亨利四世的宫廷听到的对话。事实上，你完全被排除在外，不可能验证叙述者的经历。

米歇尔·福科（Michel Foucault）在《作者是什么》（What Is an Author）这篇文章 12 指出作者与读者之间的不对等关系表现在两个方面：作者默认依据的是优越的判断力和非公开证据。福柯在他的文章中写到，在马拉美（Mallarme）之前，「文学作品」（Literary work）这个概念有更广泛的效力，因为后来被「主要文本形式」（textual modes of domination）取代了。福柯所言或许自有依据，但呈现出来的不是那种可以经读者自行验证的观察，原则上只要愿意，任何人都能查到证据验证真伪。确实奇怪，福柯之前似乎没人注意过文学史上出现过这种显著的断层。福柯没有回答这点，但如果读者追间为什么这么基本的问题以前从未注意过，答案可以分为两个部分，彼此相关又互不相同。一是，福柯有超乎常人的能力，能看到别人看不到的东西。二是，超乎常人意味着思考的依据也不同寻常。这就是为什么福柯不能像多德那样向读者指出结论的依据。要想验证多德的话，我们可能需要花费大半生的时间获得 —— 研究第四部福音书手稿传统需要的语言知识、历史知识和专业知识，以及现代编辑批判性审查的决策力 —— 但已有数百人获得了这些能力，原则上任何有意愿的人都可以这样做。福柯的证据很难获得，这种能力不仅大多数人没有，而且实际上无法获得；相反，他的证据基本都是个人的。甚至你需要具备福柯那样超乎常人的洞察力，才能意识到他的证据是证据：毕竟，这是自马拉美以来所有人都能看到却没意识到的事实，是文学作品与主要文本形式之间存在历史断层的证据。

读者可以这么认为，福柯拥有过人的能力，但读者没有，所以理解不了他那种过人能力，自然不能像他那样观察事物。他只能从作者那里知道。在古典文章中，作者与读者不会发生这种不对等关系，因为在古典风格中，观察和判断依据的是普遍标准而不是特殊标准。

作者真实可信

古典风格作者能佐证自己说的话，因为这是他独立思考出来的。尽管独立思考得出的是普通结论，但他的表达不是拾人牙慧或人云亦云。他的结论是自己的思考成果。因此，尽管古典风格作者得出的是普通结论，对他来说也是一种新奇发现。这种新奇不是因为有相同体验或与别人一致。他不希望结论因为是人所共知的才被相信。说别人说过的话，说让人相信你的话，并不是古典风格作者的作风。

不是越来越多的人的认同 —— 哪怕这些人是对的 —— 赋予古典文章力量。而是因为作者的笃定，他自己得出了结论。要让一位胜任古典风格的人相信作者说的话，不用依靠权威或传统智慧或任何其他方式，只要呈现如何得出结论的推理顺序，这样其他人也能独立推理出结论。

这种事情每天都发生。一名高中生在几何课上证明了毕达哥拉斯定理，不代表他在数学上做出新突破。但如果是他自己推导出来的，而不是毕达哥拉斯，那么面对任何质疑，他都能举出真正属于自己的证明，尽管有可能很普通。但如果未经理解只是照抄推导过程，就无法提供直接证明。没有亲自推导几何定理的人面对质疑，只会无力附和公认如此：「自欧几里得以来所有几何书都这么写，那它肯定是对的。」

作者自得其乐

古典风格作者观察真相，自然也乐意与其他观察真相的群体坦率、充分地交流。要说作者对读者毫无所求也不完全对，因为作者确实希望读者能加入这个群体，他的希望如此真切以至默认读者早就是其中的一员了。

但除此之外，古典风格作者对读者别无所求，也不需要读者回馈什么：古典风格作者不会为了一己私利歪曲真相，即使实际上没有能胜任的读者。

最重要的是，古典风格作者不会表现出一副为己谋私的样子。古典风格作者什么也不需要，所以也不会想着从读者那里获得什么。

作者可以胜任

一想到清晰准确地呈现事物会遇到多少阻碍，就已经让人不敢动笔。也许你无法看清事物。也许你无法表达你看到的事物。也许你的脑子迟钝缓慢。你可能缺乏必要的知识。你可能会对自己撒谎。

就算你不担心这些会让你无能为力的潜在问题，情况也不会好到哪去，因为读者可能有疑虑，新问题来了：你如何消除读者的疑虑？

这足以让一些人放弃写作。更糟的是，从古典风格的角度来看，这足以让一些人陷入对自身作者身份所处困境的怀疑，以至放弃可能的各种主题，因为只有这些怀疑看起来确定无疑。

为避免作者陷入焦虑与沉默中，古典风格假定作者可以胜任。真相人人都能看到，作者能看到，也有能力呈现出来。这种能力相当于普通中学生证明毕达哥拉斯定理的能力，没有什么不可能，也不会太难。作者不需要无所不知，他只要具备日常所需的能力一知道自己要知道什么才能说清楚。思考有序，所言事实自然有条理。

有了这条基本规约，写文章就不会动不了笔，而是直入正题。实际上作者心中的疑虑都还在。作者知道，读者也知道，翻来覆去地说也没意思。要是呈现某个事物，一直讲呈现它怎么怎么难，多少让人觉得受骗了。「我会告诉你们如何做面包布丁。我的天，你知道用文字表述烹饪过程有多难吗？我自己会做面包布丁 —— 做过一百次了 —— 但不可能用文字说清楚合适的黏稠度是什么样的。」

古典文章中，作者能胜任这条基本规约，与不闪烁其词是相辅相成的。学术、法律和商业类文章都有各自的写作风格，它们的动机是「掩护」作者，防止别人提出作者还没确认的质疑。其中一些质疑是思想和呈现层面的。这类风格的作者费尽心思证明自己已经预见了各种质疑：作者会受自己的偏见蒙蔽吗？是否遗漏重要事实？作者的用语会不会含混不清、难以理解，甚至自相矛盾？

这些预防大都没有意义，因为否定回答一般无法验证（「不会，原则上我不可能受偏见蒙蔽」「不会，不可能遗漏重要事实」「不会，读者再怎么不近情理也不至于误解我的话」）。古典风格认为，反复说这些问题毫无意义，所以从一开始就不去考虑它们。

这条基本规约是为了避免作者和读者把时间浪费在不确定且没有结果的事情上，但并不是要限制读者的想法。作者说话笃定，才会让人信服；但读者会竭尽所能，对作者的对错做出自己的判断。读者的结论可能是：文章水准高、有古典风范、错得离谱。古典文章的作者要写出能胜任的姿态，而不是说些主题之外的事物浪费我们的时间，因为我们可以根据他呈现的事物判断他是否真能胜任。

作者私下做好全部工作

暗示的力量很强大，因为人们更愿意相信经他们参与得出或完全自己得出的结论。

暗示有不同风格，且种类繁多。从潜意识暗示到家庭寓意暗示不一而足，比如作者隐藏暗示让读者自己领会；比如你要跟反应慢的配偶、兄弟姐妹、孩子或者父母讲道理，指出问题时你会讲一些适当的事例，好像你不知道怎么做，等着他们认识到自己的职责，主动解决问题。有诗歌风格暗示，如俳句，只把鲜明的细节并列在一起，让读者自己观察和发现其中隐含的意思；有神秘风格暗示，这种风格认为真相只可意会，但不能条分缕析或准确表达出来；有参与类暗示，作者好像碰巧知道所有正确细节，但试着推理结论时遇到因难，于是让读者解决剩余的问题：有懒人风格（lotus-eater）暗示，要说又说不出来的样子，比画着手势，一句「你懂的」结束话题。

古典风格不是暗示型风格。它会完成所有必要的推敲，并准确表达出结论。

也有其他风格的作者会自己做好全部工作，但是在读者眼皮底下进行：「现在我想我需要一个装饰物来点缀收尾，可以用某种尖顶饰，做这个我需要启动车床，再找块合适的木头；我们来看看，这个不行，有裂缝；我们要找块有合适纹理的；这个可以，就它了，现在我们把它装到车床上…...」相反，古典风格作者会私下做好全部工作。他从口袋里掏出做好的尖顶饰。古典风格作者不像电视节目里的厨师，向你展示如何混合芥末和葡萄醋。他像一位主厨，他的工作是把菜端到你面前的餐桌上，但他辛苦的过程不会让你看到，他必定也不想你看到。你的桌上不会有盐瓶和胡椒瓶。

#### 1.4.5 Thought and Language

The Thought Can Stand Alone

In the classic stand on the elements of style, writing is neither a way of thinking something out nor an art that exists for its own sake. Writing is an instrument for presenting what the writer has already thought. It is a record of that thought only to the extent that the intellectual experience is indistinguishable from the order of reason. The text is not a document that implies an individual process of thought; it is not a text that refers primarily to other texts; it is a transparent way of presenting a separate reality. Classic style always implies that there is value in what it presents. Characteristically this implied value is twofold: what is presented is important and it is independently intelligible rather than valuable as part of something larger. The independently intelligible thought often carries an implicit appeal to a refined and clarified version of common experience. Classic writing is never「notes toward」a thought that might, if developed further, stand on its own, nor is it the fifth part of a systematic inquiry that is unintelligible to someone unfamiliar with the previous four parts.

Classic expression cannot justify itself in advance. It presumes upon the reader's attention as its right. To justify its presumption, it must offer something important, complete, self-contained, and intelligible. Descartes's Discourse, for example, historically considered, is a response to Montaigne's skepticism. But Montaigne is never mentioned there. Descartes's thought is offered as a freestanding fable of the writer's own experience, not as a reexamination of philosophic issues full of cross-references to the history of philosophy. Such a citational presentation could only indicate to the nonprofessional that the book cannot be read independently. In Descartes, and in many other classic writers, the style implies that anything requiring erudition, anything intelligible only to a professional or an erudite is fundamentally unimportant. The importance and intelligibility of classic expression do not depend upon special knowledge; they depend upon the reader's clear and focused mind. There is a tacit contract between writer and reader: the reader's closely focused intelligence will be repaid with something valuable and self-contained. Classic expression has the distinctive character and the neat finality of a Bach partita, which begins by breaking a silence and ends by returning to silence, leaving nothing unresolved.

One of Wallace Stevens's poems is called「The Poem That Took the Place of the Mountain.」The mountain existed before the poem and is independent of it. To a geologist, a mountain may be unintelligible by itself since it is an incident in the natural history of the earth, but it has a visual and nominal distinction and is, in common experience, an independent, distinct, and arresting object. The poem may require a dense network of concepts and conventions to be independently intelligible, but since these are widely shared within the culture in which it is written, the poem can be thought of as independently intelligible too. If we accept the idea that somehow a poem can「word for word」take the place of a mountain, we have a little emblem of classic style in which writing presents thought, nuance for nuance, in a distinct and intelligible frame.

Abstractions Can Be Clear and Exact

From the classic viewpoint, the distinction between abstract and concrete has no consequence. A writing instructor or consultant who advises us to write concretely and avoid abstractions offers shallow and impractical advice because the distinction is simpleminded. What matters is not the ontological category of the subject but rather the style in which it is conceived.

In romantic style, a tree could be conceived as if only the writer can see it for what it is. Its truth, then, has no existence independent of the writer; it depends upon the writer; to conceive of it as clear and exact would be to obliterate the writer's fragile and elusive insight, gained in a transporting moment of superior vision that language cannot express. In romantic style, there is no symmetry between writer and reader. That a tree itself is concrete does not impede a romantic writer from conceiving it in a manner unavailable to other observers, vaguely and indistinctly, as he might conceive the human soul.

By contrast, in classic style, the human soul can be conceived as clearly and exactly as the tree in front of your face. When a classic stylist presents an abstraction — cultural reality, heroism, historical causation, the nature of representation, taste — it is first conceived as independent of the writer, exhaustively definite at all levels of detail, visible to anyone competent who is standing in a position to see it, immediately recognizable, and capable of being expressed in direct and simple language.

Abstractions are not in themselves bad, vague, or inexact. They are only so in certain styles of conceiving them. When a classic writer deals in abstractions, it takes an effort to remind ourselves that she is not talking about a stone, a leaf, a statue. A classic writer presents the concrete diamond and its aesthetic beauty as if both are visible, clear, and exact.

Thought Precedes Speech

In the classic view, writing is not thinking. This runs counter to an extremely powerful and pervasive connection between a concept of writing and a concept of mind. Records are understood as a sort of external memory, and memory as internal records. Writing is thinking on paper, and thought is writing in the mind. The author's mind is an endless paper on which he writes, making mind internal writing; and the book he writes is external mind, the external form of that writing. The author is the self thinking. The self is the author writing in the mind. (Hamlet says,「Within the book and volume of my brain.」) Sometimes, the self is an author who records the process of his thinking on paper.

Classic style takes an entirely different view. Since it is a presentational style, this kind of writing, at least, depends upon a prior process of thought. It is having a thought that is the very motive for writing. The kind of thinking a classic writer does, inasmuch as he is a writer, is limited to strategic thinking about presentation and is never explicit. Thinking is not writing; even more important, writing is not thinking. This does not mean that in classic style all of the thinking precedes all of the writing, but rather that the classic writer does not write as he is thinking something out and does not think by writing something out. Between the period of one sentence and the beginning of the next, there is space for the flash of perfect thought, which is all the classic writer needs. The sentence begins only after the thought it expresses has been completed. To the classic writer, the difference between thinking and writing is as wide as the difference between cooking and serving. In every great restaurant there is a kitchen, where the work is done, and a dining room, where the result is presented. The dining room is serene, and the presentation suggests that perfection is routine and effortless, no matter how hectic things get in the kitchen. Naturally the kitchen and the dining room are in constant and intimate contact, but it is part of the protocol of a great restaurant to treat them as if they existed on different planets. The cooks do not sit down and relax in the dining room and the guests do not observe the work of the kitchen.

Seeing something is not the same as presenting something. We can present only what we have already seen and recognized. In classic style, thinking is seeing, or more generally, recognizing; writing is presenting what the writer has seen so the reader can see it, too. The classic writer seems to be trying to place something before your eyes or trying to put you where he is so you can see what he sees.

The Language Is Sufficient

There are styles of writing that suggest that while words are inadequate, there is nothing else available, so writers do the best they can without expecting their language to do more than approximate their thought. Classic style takes the opposite stand. There are not merely better and worse ways of expressing particular thoughts, there is a best way. Everything that can be known can be said. Moreover, it is always possible to achieve a perfect fit between a thought and its expression just as it is always possible to achieve a perfect solution to a problem in elementary algebra.

A few years ago, The Wall Street Journal ran a short article about a dispute between a French government agency and a group of French research scientists. The scientists were publishing a journal in English; the government agency objected on the plausible grounds that the results of scientific research done by French scientists and supported by the French government ought to be published in French. The scientists retorted that English had become, for most purposes, the international language of science, so if scientists want their research reports to be read, they simply have to be published in English. The point was given summary expression in the following sentence:「To shun English is to court isolation.」

This seven-word sentence has an economy, a symmetry, and a fit between thought and expression that suggest perfection, not compromise or approximation, and it is the sort of perfection that, once achieved, seems natural, not labored. It is something like tapping a golf ball with just enough force to sink it. It is a convention of classic style that every thought has a perfect expression; writers can fail to fit language to thought, but that is merely a failure of craftsmanship, not a limitation of the craftsman's material.

When we talk about a「way of putting」something, we suggest that there are many ways of expressing the same thought, each with its strengths and inescapable limitations. Any particular way of putting something is then just one way, necessarily incomplete and insufficient, so the price of putting a thought into any particular set of words is compromise.

The classic stand adopts as an enabling convention the opposite view: language is sufficient to any thought. Imperfect expression is the fault of limited writers, not limited language. It is not merely that the classic writer is a master of language; many writers in many styles are manifest masters of language. The classic writer works with the additional convention that the language he masters is sufficient to any thought. The classic writer must not make the language appear to struggle, giving the impression that the language is in over its head, fighting to survive. The classic writer does not use language to suggest a truth he cannot formulate. Suggestive language is merely imperfect use of language. Classic style avoids colloquialisms, neologisms, periphrases, and slang because it does not need them: the language is sufficient without them. New thoughts do not require new language.

Classic Thought and Classic Language Match

There are two kinds of fit between thought and language in classic style. The first — which makes the writer's language sufficient to his thought — is lexical: there are already expressions in the language to fit any thought.

The second — which makes the writer's language an image of his thought — is structural. Thought comes with a structure and a direction. Its structure is built upon skeletal images that underlie our everyday experience. We have a skeletal image, or image schema, of moving toward an object. We have an image schema of adding one thing to another. We have an image schema of a path that leads from a source to a goal. We have many image schemas, of hesitation and advance, of movement from a center to a periphery, of entering or leaving, of enclosing or extracting, of rising or falling, of stopping or penetrating. These image schemas are not exclusively visual. We have an image schema of a rising pitch, of increasing pressure, of a jab to the skin, and so on. Many of our most important and useful image schemas have to do with the way we structure space and interact with space. We use these spatial image schemas to make sense of abstract things that are not themselves spatial. We think of time as linear or circular. We think of solving a problem as「moving toward」a goal along a path. We think of the reasoning mind as a body moving in space, which「comes upon」ideas,「looks them over,」「picks them up」for examination,「drops」them to look「further afield,」and so on. A great deal of our reasoning consists of metaphoric projections of these bodily and spatial image schemas onto abstract concepts. We think of events, which have no shape, as having a shape: open ended or closed, discrete or continuous, cyclic or linear.

In the classic view, the prototype of truth is a thought that comes structured by one of these basic image schemas or some recognizable combination or extension of them.

But these same image schemas structure expression as well. Expressions are forms, and these forms can have image-schematic structure. A sentence, for example, can be thought of as linear, as moving, as approaching a point. A classic thought that has the image-schematic structure of moving along a path to stop sharply at an end for which the path exists will be mirrored in a sentence that has the image-schematic structure of moving along a path to stop smartly at an end for which the preceding part of the sentence exists. Here is an example from Clifford Geertz.「[I]f you want to understand what a science is, you should look in the first instance not at its theories or its findings, and certainly not at what its apologists say about it; you should look at what the practitioners of it do.」

It is possible for thought and language to be misaligned in one of three ways. First, you can write a sentence that cannot be grasped through any basic image schema. This is unusual, since most writers align their sentences with basic image schemas automatically and unconsciously. Occasionally, however, writers with an advanced knowledge of prose style become self-conscious and defensive about their own writing and begin to misalign sentences. The result is both difficult to read and impossible to correct by making local revisions. Here is an example:「The fact is that the subtlety and control which philologists were willing to attribute to earlier writers' spellings and word-groupings as registers of distinctive features in phonology and morphology by and large stopped there.」

Second, you can write a sentence that evokes an image schema but then fails to fulfill it or complete it. Suppose Geertz had written,「If you want to understand what a science is, you should look in the first instance not at its theories but you should instead, putting aside its findings, concentrate your attention on its practice entirely, taking care not to be distracted by anything its apologists might say about that.」The first half of this sentence, to the word「theories,」sets the reader to expect a crisp opposition. But the second half of the sentence frustrates the expectation.

Third, you can have a thought that is structured by an image schema but express it in a sentence structured by a different image schema. Suppose Geertz had written,「If you want to understand what a science is, and you look at its theories and its findings and its representations by apologists, you will find that you must set all this aside to look at what its practitioners do, which is where you should have directed your attention in the first instance.」The image schema of Geertz's original thought consists of rejecting several things in order to select a different one. The image schema of his original sentence is compatible with the image schema of his thought. But the revision of his sentence is structured by an image schema of attending to various things and then returning to the beginning to attend to something different. The image schema that structures the revised sentence is common, but it is incompatible with the image schema that structured the thought it was meant to mirror.

Perhaps the most common image schema used in structuring expression is movement along a directed path from a source to a goal. In this image schema, the end of the sentence seems to be the goal of the sentence, what it is trying to get to. In consequence, there is a phenomenon in English known as the stress position: whatever you put at the end of the sentence will be taken, absent direction to the contrary, to be the most important part of the sentence, as it is in Geertz's sentence:「you should look at what the practitioners of [the science] do.」

Classic style respects the stress position. La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence about Madame de Chevreuse — like Geertz's — puts the point of the thought at the end of the sentence:「and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way.」The end of the sentence seems to be the reason the sentence is written; everything leads to it; and the sentence stops confidently when it reaches that end because the image schema of both thought and expression is complete. The use of the stress position in classic style is often quite subtle, but the classic writer frequently plays on it, as in this description of the northern shrike:「Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage.」Rearranging this sentence in any way diminishes it.

A common perceptual image schema is focusing-and-then-inspecting. First we locate the object or domain of interest, and then we inspect its details. This image schema is not restricted to visual perception; it operates equally well in tactile, auditory, and kinesthetic perception. Classic thought frequently follows this fundamental image schema, focusing on a subject and then inspecting its details, and classic expression of this thought shares the same image schema, first presenting the subject and then presenting details.

Many of the most familiar image schemas have to do with forces — impinging, pushing, pressuring, stopping, overcoming — especially when these forces are applied by agents in action. A classic thought is often structured by an image schema of action. Its classic expression mirrors this structure. The structure of the expression conforms to the structure of the action: the subject is an agent and the verb is the action performed by the agent.

Classic style is compelling often exactly because it exploits such common image schemas. Truth comes with basic image-schematic structure. We expect its expression to come with the same structure. Consequently, when a sentence has a clear image-schematic structure, it seems plausible that what the sentence expresses is true.

This is a psychological tactic of persuasion, founded upon our readiness to accept whatever has the same form as what we have already accepted. Consider roles, such as president, pope, professor, policeman. We accept new holders of these roles largely because they adopt an institutional form we have already accepted. The new president operates in known and accepted forms such as formal messages to Congress and press conferences in the Rose Garden. Presidential primaries are largely a test of who can best pick up the established forms. The new pope is accepted partly because he dresses in the same anachronistic fashion as the old pope, and uses the same ambiguous language of indirection. For centuries, visual representations of scholars have included a case of books in the background, and this form abides tenaciously even now, when scholarly work is as likely to involve brains in vats or electronic texts.

In the classic view, truth comes with a structure that we already know and accept. Adopting a new truth does not mean adopting a new form. In classic style, a new truth will be expressed in old words structured in a reassuringly familiar form.

The observation that expression mirrors thought by inheriting its image-schematic structure is both ancient and common in the history of rhetoric. Longinus views many rhetorical figures as linguistic instruments for achieving this alignment. For example, repeated physical striking has an image-schematic structure; it can be mirrored in expression through linguistic anaphora, as in:「By his manner, his looks, his voice, when he strikes you with insult, when he strikes you like an enemy, when he strikes you with his knuckles, when he strikes you like a slave.」Demetrius talks of linguistic constructions being「rounded,」「disjointed,」「hastening towards a definite goal as runners do when they leave the starting-place,」「circular,」「tense,」「periodic,」and so on. He remarks that thought comes with part-whole structure that can be mirrored in the linguistic construction, and that we experience syntactic constructions image-schematically:「Long journeys are shortened by a succession of inns, while desolate paths, even when the distances are short, give the impression of length. Precisely the same principle will apply also in the case of members [linguistic constructions].」

Classic style typically aligns the image schemas structuring thought and its expression, but in a fashion that escapes notice. There are other, contrasting styles that intend to raise this correspondence to the level of the remarkable, to show the skillful labor of the writer, as does Longinus's example of anaphora. The role of image schemas in the alignment of thought and language, once treated in ancient rhetoric, has resurfaced as a topic in contemporary philosophy, cognitive science, and linguistics.

1.4.5 思想和语言

思想可独立存在

在古典风格对风格元素的立场中，写作不是思考问题的工具，也不是为了写而写的纯粹艺术。写作只是把作者考虑成熟的东西呈现出来。它记录思想，仅限于把思想活动呈现为某种推理顺序。记录下来的文本不是一份包含个体思想过程的文件；也不是一份专门回应其他文本的文本；它是一种透明的媒介，用以呈现独立存在的现实。古典风格总是默认呈现有价值的事物。本质上，这种默认的价值有两重含义：呈现的事物很重要；可以独立理解而非某物的一部分。能被独立理解的思想通常基于共同经验，这种经验经过提炼后变得清晰。古典写作从来都不是某种思想的「注解」，进一步发展才有可能独立存在；也不是某个系统调查的第五部分，必须先了解前面四部分才能看懂后面。

古典表达的魅力无法在阅读之前展现出来，它把读者的高度关注假定为自己的权利。要使这种假定名副其实，它讲述的东西必须重要、完整、独立且容易理解。比如笛卡儿的《谈谈方法》，历史上是对蒙田的怀疑论的回应。但书中从未提及蒙田。笛卡儿的思想，是以独立的故事讲述作者的个人经验，而不是重新验证充满了交叉参照的哲学历史的哲学问题。这种引述式呈现只会向非专业人士暗示这本书不能单独阅读。从笛卡儿及许多其他古典风格作者的风格中可以看出，非博学不能通的内容，非专才通才不能理解的东西，基本都不重要。古典表达是否重要和能否理解，不在于有多少专业知识，而在于读者能否清晰、专注地思考。作者和读者墨守的约定是：作者应提供有价值且独立完整的内容，以回馈读者的高度关注与敏锐思考。古典表达可比作巴赫变奏曲，与众不同，干净利落，从起初划破沉寂到最后回归沉寂，不留任何悬而未决的东西。

华菜士·斯蒂文斯（Wallace Stevens）有一首诗叫《一首诗取代了一座高山》（The Poem That Took the Place of the Mountain）。这首诗写出来之前。这座山就已经存在，且独立于这首诗存在。对于地质学家来说，一座山本身很难理解，因为它是地球自然史中的事件，但它可见可指称，而且在大众经验中是一个独立、清晰又醒目的物体。要独立理解这首诗，可能需要先理解某个复杂网络中的概念和规约，但是因为这些在本诗所属的文化中已广为人知，所以可以认为这首诗能被独立理解。如果我们认同一首诗可以「逐字逐句地」取代一座山，我们也可以以此类此古典风格：在一个清晰且容易理解的框架之中，写作可以经由一个个细节呈现思想。

抽象可清晰准确

站在古典风格的立场看，用抽象和具体区分事物没有意义。有些写作讲师或顾问可能建议写作要具体、避免抽象，这种建议肤浅且不实用，因为把二者的区别想得太简单了。问题不在于事物的本体论归属，而在于构思事物的风格。

在浪漫风格中，作者能把一棵树看成好像只有他才能看到它本来的样子。这样的一棵树无法独立于作者而存在；它取决于作者；若是把它看成清晰具体的东西，就会抹灭作者灵光一现的洞见，这种洞见脆弱又难以捉摸，无法用语言描述。在浪漫风格中，作者与读者不是对等关系。树本身具体可见，但不影响浪漫作者用一种其他人无法观察的方式设想，就像他想象人类灵魂一样模糊不定。

古典风格与之相反，人类灵魂可以想得像你眼前的树一样清晰具体。古典风格作者呈现的抽象事物 —— 文化现实、英雄主义、历史因果、再现性的本质、味道 —— 独立于作者存在，各个层次的细节巨细无遗，任何有能力的人站在合适位置都会看到，很容易辨认，而且可以用简单直接的语言表达。

并不是抽象本身不好、模糊或不明确。只是用了某些风格思考时才这样。古典风格作者谈论抽象事物时，如果我们不刻意提醒自己，还以为他说的是一块石头、一片树叶、一座雕像。无论具体的钻石还是它的艺术美学，古典风格作者的呈现就好像两者都是清晰具体的有形事物。

思想先于表达

古典风格认为，写作不是思考。与之相反的是一个广为人知的观点：写作与大脑是一组密切相关的概念。记录被看成一种外在记忆，记忆被看成一种内在记录。写作是纸上的思考，思想是大脑的写作。作者的大脑相当于一张不会写完的纸，作者写在上面，把思想变成内在写作；他写的书是外在的思想，是大脑写作的外在形式。作者是正在思考的自我，自我是进行大脑写作的作者。（哈姆雷特说，「在我头脑的书卷之中。」）有时候，自我是将他的思考过程记于纸上的作者。

古典风格的态度完全不同。因为它是一种呈现型风格，至少是先有思考然后写出来。它形成的想法，就是写作的动机。古典风格作者的这种思考，考虑到他是作者，仅限于呈现的战略型思考，而且不太清晰。

思考不是写作；更重要的是，写作不是思考。不是说古典风格在开始写之前就要把所有问题都想好，而是古典风格作者不会边想边写，也不会以写代替思考。作者只用在一句话结束后、另一句话开始前闪现完美的思想。刚想好要表达什么，句子随之写出来。对古典风格作者而言，思考于写作就如烹饪于上菜，是完全不同的东西。每家正规餐馆都有一间用于准备食物的厨房，和一间用于呈上食物的餐厅。无论厨房里多么忙乱，餐厅总是一片安静祥和，呈现的菜品让人觉得，完美是一项轻而易举的普通工作。厨房和餐厅之间自然是密切相关、频繁往来，但一家正规餐馆的规范之一就是，当它们在不同的星球上。厨师不会坐在餐厅休息，客人不会去厨房参观。

看见不等同于呈现。我们只能呈现我们看见并认出来的东西。在古典风格中，思考是观看，或者更广泛地讲，思考是辨认；写作是呈现作者所见，让读者也能看到。古典风格作者似乎尽力把东西放在你眼前，或者尽力让你站在他的位置上，这样你就能看到他看到的。

语言足以表达

有些写作风格表示，语言不足以表达时再也没有别的方式可以表达，所以作者只不过是尽其所能让语言贴近思想。古典风格的立场怡恰相反。对特定思想的表达不仅有好有坏，而且有最优表达。凡是可知的事物就能被人们表达出来。而且，每种思想都有完美的表达，就像初等代数中每个问题都有完美的求解。

几年前，《华尔街日报》刊登了一篇短文，讲述某法国政府机构和一群法国研究科学家之间的争议。这些科学家准备用英语发表一篇报告；该政府机构对此表示反对，反对理由看起来很充分：这些科学研究是法国科学家的成果，而且由法国政府支持，应该用法语发表。科学家们反驳道，英语已经成为科学领域大多数场合的国际通用语言，如果科学家希望他们的科研报告被阅读，只能用英语发表。有句话总结了这种观点：「回避英语就是自行隔离」（To shun English is to court isolation）。13

这句话共七个单词，思想与表达之间有一种简练的对称和契合，这是一种不会妥协也绝非近似的完美，一旦达到，看起来就会自然而然、轻而易举。这像打高尔夫球时挥杆的力度刚够进球。古典风格的规约是每种思想都有完美的表达；作者可能没找到契合思想的语言，但这只是作者水准欠佳，而不是作者用的材料不行。

当我们谈论某物的「表述方式」时，意味着有多种方式表达同一种想法，每种表达各有优势，但不可避免也有局限。每种具体的表述方式只是其中一种，肯定有不完整和不充分的地方。因此一种思想选用任何一组特定词句表达，都要付出妥协的代价。

古典立场的基础规约与之相反：语言足以表达任何想法。表达不完美是作者水平有限，而不是语言有限。不是说只有古典风格作者精通语言，许多其他风格的作者显然也精通语言。古典风格作者秉持的另一条规约是，他掌握的语言足以表达任何思想。古典风格作者不能表达得很费力，给读者一种语言无法胜任表达的感觉。古典风格作者不会用语言暗示他无法确切说明的真相。暗示性语言是没有完美运用语言的表现。古典风格不会用俗语、新造词、遁词和俚语，因为不需要用到它们：没有它们，语言也足够表达。表达新的想法不需要用新的语言。

古典语言可贴合古典思想

古典风格中，思想和语言的契合表现为两个层面。第一种是词汇上的契合，作者的语言足够表达他的思想，因为语言中已经存在适合任何想法的表达。

第二种是结构上的契合，结构使作者的语言成为反映思想的意象。思想有它的结构和方向。它的结构基于我们日常经历的基本意象。临近某个物体是一种基本意象，或者说意象图式（image schema）。往某物上添加东西是一种意象图式。一条从起点到终点的路径是一种意象图式。还有很多意象图式：踌躇和前进、从中心到两边、进入或离开、包围或提取、上升或下降、停止或蔓延。这些意象图式并非只有视觉意象，还有音调上升、压力增加、扎刺皮肤等意象。许多最重要、最有用的意象图式与我们的空间构建方式和空间交互方式有关。这些空间意象图式可以帮助我们理解本身不是空间结构的抽象事物。我们把时间理解成线状或环状。我们认为解决问题是沿着某条路径「达到」（moving toward）目标。我们把推理的大脑看作空间中移动的身体，「发现」（comes upon）想法，「朝上看」（looks them over）「举起来「(picks them up），「放下」（drops）它们「往远」（further afield）看，等等。我们很多的推理判断都是用这些人体及空间意象图式比拟抽象的概念。事件本没有形状，但我们把它理解成某种形状：开放式或封闭式，离散型或连续型，周期性或线性。

古典风格认为，真相的原型依存的思想结构是这些基本意象图式，也可以是相互组合或延伸后新组的可识别形式。

但是这些相同的意象图式也能构建表达。不同表达即不同形式，而这些形式具备意象图式的结构。比如，一个句子可以看作线型、前进、正靠近某个点。如果某种古典思想的意象图式结构是沿着一条路径向前移动，在这条路径为之存在的终点突然结束，这种意象图式结构表现在句子中仍是沿着一条路径向前移动，在句子前面部分为之存在的末尾利落结束。比如克利福德·格尔茨（Clifford Geertz）这个例子：「假如你想了解什么是科学，首先要做的不是看它的理论或成果，当然也不是看它的辩护者说了什么；你应该看看它的从业者在做什么。」4

思想和语言不一致，有三种可能。

第一，你写的句子无法用任何基本意象图式来理解。这很少见，因为大多数作者会不自觉地用基本意象图式调整他们的句子。但有时候，作者学习了文章风格的进阶知识后，对他们自己的写作会带有自我意识和防卫心理，导致句子偏离基本意象图式。结果，写出来的东西不仅很难读下去，也无法通过局部修订来调整。以这句话为例：「事实是，这种微妙和克制 —— 语言学家愿意归因于早期作家在拼写和词组上选择了有鲜明的音韵和词法特征的语体风格 —— 大体上自那之后就没有了。」15

第二，你写的句子唤起了某个意象图式，但没有履行或完成它。假设格尔茨这样写：「假如你想了解什么是科学，首先要做的不是看它的理论，而是应该先把它的成果放一边，把注意力全部放在它的实践上，注意不要被它的辩护者说的任何话干扰。」这句话的前半部分说到「理论」这个词，引起读者预期与之截然相反的东西。但句子的后半部分却没有回应这种预期。

第三，你用了某种意象图式构建你的想法，但表达成句子时用的是另一种不同的意象图式。假设格尔茨这样写：「如果你想了解什么是科学，并看了它的理论和成果及它的辩护者说了什么，你会发现必须把所有这些放到一边，看看它的从业者在做什么，这是你一开始就应关注的地方。」格尔茨原本的思想的意象图式是依次拒绝若干东西，选出一项不同的东西。他本人的句子的意象图式，与他的思想的意象图式相吻合。修改后的句子的意象图式是先做几件事，再回到开头做不同的事情。改后的句子的意象图式很常见，但不符合它要反映的思想的意象图式。

也许构建表达最常用的意象图式是，沿着一条路前进，从起点直到终点。在这种意象图式中，句子的结尾似乎是句子的目标，它努力要抵达的地方。因此，英语中有一种现象叫焦点位置：无论你在句子结尾放什么内容（除非句子的方向是反的），都会被当作句子最重要的部分，就像格尔茨的句子结尾是：「你应该看看（科学）从业者在做什么。」

古典风格遵行焦点位置。拉罗什福科描述谢弗勒兹夫人的古典句子 —— 与格尔茨一样 —— 将思想要点放在句末：「她几乎总是给那些她碰到的人带来灾难。」句子的结尾似乎是作者写出这句话的原因；每件事情都指向这个结尾；句子来到末尾时干脆地结束了，因为思想和表达这两者的意象图式都已完成。焦点位置在古典风格中通常用得相当微妙，但古典风格作者经常利用这一点，比如这句描述灰伯劳的话：「与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用喙捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆棘或铁丝网上储存起来」。用任何方式重组这句话，都比不上原来的表达。

常见的知觉意象图式是先关注后观察（focusing-and-then-inspecting）。

首先我们找到感兴趣的事物或领域，然后观察它的细节。这种意象图式不局限于视觉；触觉、听觉和动觉也同样适用。古典思想经常引用这种基本意象图式，关注某个主题，然后观察它的细节。表达这种思想的古典句子遵循同样的意象图式，先呈现主题，然后呈现细节。

许多最常见的意象图式都与力量有关 —— 撞击、推动、施压、停止或压倒 —— 尤其当主体通过行动施加这些力量时。古典思想常用行动意象图式构建。它这种结构会反映在相应的古典句子中。表达的结构跟行动的结构一致：主语是行为主体，而动词是行为主体实施的行动。

古典风格容易令人信服，恰恰是因为它利用了这些常见的意象图式。真相有基本的意象图式结构。我们期望它的表达具有相同的结构。因此，当句子表现出清晰的意象图式结构时，更容易让人相信句子表达的是真相。

这是一种说服式的，心理策略，当我们已经接受什么后，我们很容易接受任何与之相同的形式。想想总统、教授和警察这类角色。我们接受这些角色的新上任者，很大程度上是因为他们采用了我们已经熟悉的体制形式。新总统遵循的是公众已熟悉和认可的做法，如向国会发布正式信息，在玫瑰园举行新闻发布会。总统大选初选主要考验谁最可能沿袭既定做法。几个世纪以来，我们看到学者出现的背景都是一排排书籍，这种做法一直沿袭至今，尽管学术工作很可能只是涉及缸中之脑类的脑力工作或电子文本。

古典风格认为，真相以一种我们熟知的结构为我们所接受。接受新的真相，并不意味着要接受新的形式。在古典风格中，用已有的词汇表达、用熟悉易理解的形式构建新的真相。

表达能反映思想是因为沿袭了思想的意象图式结构，这是修辞史上早就有的普遍观点。朗吉弩斯（Longinus）把修辞手法看作实现这种匹配的语言工具。例如，重复的物理打击是一种意象图式结构。这种重复在语言表达中表现为首语重复，比如：「当他用辱骂打击你，当他像敌人一样打击你，当他用他的指关节打击你，当他像对待奴隶一样打击你，他的态度、他的神色、他的声音无不在实施打击。」（By his manner,, hiS looks, his voce, when he strikes youith nutwhen he strikes you like anmy, when he strikes you with his knuckles, when he strikes you like a slave.）16

德米特里（Demetrus）说语言结构是「完整的」「不连贯的」「像跑步运动员一样从起点冲向终点」「循环往复的」「紧绷的」「周期性的」等 17。他说思想的「部分整体」结构会反映在语言结构上，而我们以意象图式感受句法结构：「长途旅行因为有一个又一个旅馆而使人不觉得漫长，而荒凉的短途，距离虽短，却让人觉得漫长。同样的原则刚好也适用于语言结构。」18

古典风格通常用意象图式结构校正思想和表达是否一致，但用的是一种读者不易察觉的方式。有些风格截然不同，会有意彰显这种对应关系，以显示作者的用心和才能，如朗吉弩斯首语重复的例子。意象图式在匹配语言和思想方面的作用，早在古代修辞中就讨论过，如今又重新成为哲学、认知科学和语言学探讨的话题。
