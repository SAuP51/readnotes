致力于挖掘体系的构建，而非某个算法！对于刚入门数据挖掘的人来说，这书绝对会让你感觉自己是个折翼的天使。因为一开始就各种各样的理论扑面而来，而对于那些经典的算法却只是做一个感性的介绍，并没有那种流程图式的清晰解说。总之就是，不易上手。但是在这种不面善的情况，为什么该书却被国内外奉为经典，而作者也备受各方专家推崇呢？而纠结一段时间，在注意到一个问题后也就开始领悟了。在目前的挖掘领域最难的并不是那些个算法，就跟当年数据库理论刚出来一样，算法与运用设想上可谓是热闹非凡，但是在商界却并没有真正的将其实践化，为什么？！就因为那些个理论都忘记了关键的一点，数据库要怎么做！只知道做好了可以怎样那就相当于是纸上谈兵。于是乎，在这种虚空的「狂热」过了很久，直到 1976 年 —— Peter P.S Chen 博士提出的关系型数据库才真正使这些领先于潮流者得以实现。

而无独有偶，现在数据挖掘貌似面临着相似的问题。各类挖掘算法和畅想的著述可谓是汗牛充栋，但却都不自觉地在回避两个问题：1）每一门学科都肯定尤其综述谱系，而对于数据挖掘，尤其是面对各种新型挖掘的出现，这个谱该怎么弄，又是什么？2）为什么数据挖掘喊了这么多年的口号，其推广却并没有像宣传的那样给科技带来很多实质性的改变？

我想，这本书也正是在致力于解决这两个问题吧。作者参照历史经验，结合自己的认识将整个挖掘理论进行系统化的整理。这是件很了不起但确实「巧合」的事，因为想做的人不一定能被别人认可，而能做的又不一定有时间，而韩也算是刚好赶上了。正如其所言，做研究就要去尝试发现蓝海，那样才能有大收获，才能有绝对的话语权。我想这句话的另一层理解可以是，就算他不去做，也早晚会有人去弄的。

还有就是数据挖掘的实质推广性了。先不说其网站上的各种科研实践课题，但就其认识与分析整个挖掘发展的瓶颈与趋势来看，这是其他书所不能及的。该书并没有沉溺于各种算法间不可自拔，也就没有画出流程图，作者只是在试图讲清算法原理的情况，更注重对各种算法的产生原因 —— 问题进行详述，让读者读完之后不会陷入各种纠结的算法步骤中，而是能够对整个挖掘进行深刻的认识。

任何事情都是双面的，而也没有一本书能够适用于所有人，这书也就不例外。对于初学者，其虽然有系统的论述，但是还是得花一番气力来细读的。而对于实践者，当涉及到某个具体算法的实现时，这书也不适合，因为毫无实现的提示，只能算是给出了一个解决方法概述。当然如果真需要的话，还是可以按他的推荐来寻找更详细的说明的。翻译的很差劲，看不出教授的水平。

一本引导你入门的书，知识深浅都涵盖，描述广泛但不详实易懂。前几个 chapter 屁话较多，但 OLAP 的概念是有用的。随后的 cluster，association 的分析解释还是涵盖的很好，但都是点到为止，颇具教科书的味道，其实被来就是一本教科书。剩下的章节就不能看了。6 年前就通读此书（2007 年），觉得很深，随后几年翻翻，发现的一个缺点是应用性不强。比如 association 分析，如何更好应用于行业，是值得思考的。

### 14

这本书是刚上研究生的时候开始看的，这本书介绍的数据挖掘基本上是从数据库的概念出发的，对各种算法都有提及，但是很多算法基本上是语焉不详，对于刚开始学习数据挖掘和机器学习的学生来说，能对数据挖掘的基本概念有所了解，对算法也只能了解个大概了。如果不是纯搞数据仓库 + 挖掘，个人更推荐刘兵的《WEB Data Mining》。Bishop 大神的《Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning》。

### 15

很高兴看到这本书的作者之一 Jiawei Han 是中国人，先自豪一下。这本书最大的特点就是概念性强（相对于《数据挖掘中的实用机器学习工具及技术》），从数据仓库到关联规则，从聚类到神经网络，最后几个章节还有数据挖掘技术的热门应用介绍。总的来说，作者希望覆盖数据挖掘技术的方方面面的应用，也尽量将概念讲的详细。这个目标算是基本上达到了。但是这本书不能算是一本经典的数据挖掘介绍书籍。为什么呢？首先，过分的追求「全」就会让人分散注意力，比如书中关于 outlier detection 讲解了很多算法，但是都不详细，不过还好在书后的引用中找到相关论文。另外，这本书中规中矩，而让我感觉出彩的方面不多（或许是我要求太高？我不知道）。

数据挖掘还在迅猛发展，所以打算写本好书的家伙们好好考虑一下吧！PS：说点不太相关的，谁能推荐一本关于模式识别的书？请不要推荐 Bishop 的《机器学习和模式识别》以及《模式分类》，我希望书籍跟读者的距离更近点，《模式分类》还没怎么看，不过 Bishop 大神的书数学公式实在太多。

数据挖掘功能包括发现概念 / 类描述、关联、分类、预测、聚类、趋势分析、偏差分析和类似性分析。特征化和区分是数据汇总的形式。数据分类 (data classification) 是一个两步过程：1）建立一个模型，描述预定的数据类集或概念集。通过分析由属性描述的数据库元组来构造模型。2）使用模型进行分类。「预测和分类有何不同？」预测（prediction）是构造和使用模型评估无标号样本类，或评估给定样本可能具有的属性值或值区间。在这种观点下，分类和回归是两类主要预测问题，其中分类是预测离散或标称值，而回归用于预测连续或有序值。然而，我们的观点是：用预测法预测类标号为分类，用预测法预测连续值（例如使用回归方法）为预测。这种观点在数据挖掘界被广泛接受。

chp7 用判断树归纳分类。判断树（decision tree）是一个类似流程图的树结构，气质每个内部节点表示在一个属性上的测试，每个分支代表一个测试输出，而每个树叶节点代表类或者类分布。chp8 聚类分析。将物理或抽象对象的集合分组成为由类似的对象组成的多个类的过程被称为聚类。聚类的方法有：1）划分方法 partitioning method；2) 层次方法 hierarchical method；3) 基于密度的方法 density-based method；4）基于网格的方法 grid-based method；5）基于模型的方法 model-based method。

## Foreword

The problem then becomes how to analyze the data. This is exactly the focus of this Third Edition of the book. Jiawei, Micheline, and Jian give encyclopedic coverage of all the related methods, from the classic topics of clustering and classification, to database methods (e.g., association rules, data cubes) to more recent and advanced topics (e.g., SVD/PCA, wavelets, support vector machines).

The exposition is extremely accessible to beginners and advanced readers alike. The book gives the fundamental material first and the more advanced material in follow-up chapters. It also has numerous rhetorical questions, which I found extremely helpful for maintaining focus.

We have used the first two editions as textbooks in data mining courses at Carnegie Mellon and plan to continue to do so with this Third Edition. The new version has significant additions: Notably, it has more than 100 citations to works from 2006 onward, focusing on more recent material such as graphs and social networks, sensor networks, and outlier detection. This book has a new section for visualization, has expanded outlier detection into a whole chapter, and has separate chapters for advanced methods — for example, pattern mining with top-k patterns and more and clustering methods with biclustering and graph clustering. Overall, it is an excellent book on classic and modern data mining methods, and it is ideal not only for teaching but also as a reference book.

We are deluged by data — scientific data, medical data, demographic data, financial data, and marketing data. People have no time to look at this data. Human attention has become the precious resource. So, we must find ways to automatically analyze the data, to automatically classify it, to automatically summarize it, to automatically discover and characterize trends in it, and to automatically flag anomalies. This is one of the most active and exciting areas of the database research community. Researchers in areas including statistics, visualization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are contributing to this field. The breadth of the field makes it difficult to grasp the extraordinary progress over the last few decades.

1『automatically flag anomalies 自动标记异常。』

The field has matured with many new and improved algorithms, and has broadened to include many more datatypes: streams, sequences, graphs, time-series, geospatial, audio, images, and video. We are certainly not at the end of the golden age — indeed research and commercial interest in data mining continues to grow — but we are all fortunate to have this modern compendium.

The book gives quick introductions to database and data mining concepts with particular emphasis on data analysis. It then covers in a chapter-by-chapter tour the concepts and techniques that underlie classification, prediction, association, and clustering. These topics are presented with examples, a tour of the best algorithms for each problem class, and with pragmatic rules of thumb about when to apply each technique. The Socratic presentation style is both very readable and very informative.

## Preface

The computerization of our society has substantially enhanced our capabilities for both generating and collecting data from diverse sources. A tremendous amount of data has flooded almost every aspect of our lives. This explosive growth in stored or transient data has generated an urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can intelligently assist us in transforming the vast amounts of data into useful information and knowledge. This has led to the generation of a promising and flourishing frontier in computer science called data mining, and its various applications. Data mining, also popularly referred to as knowledge discovery from data (KDD), is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored or captured in large databases, data warehouses, the Web, other massive information repositories, or data streams.

1『上面最后一行信息是对「数据挖掘」的定义。』

This book explores the concepts and techniques of knowledge discovery and data mining. As a multidisciplinary field, data mining draws on work from areas including statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, database technology, information retrieval, network science, knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and data visualization. We focus on issues relating to the feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability of techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets. As a result, this book is not intended as an introduction to statistics, machine learning, database systems, or other such areas, although we do provide some background knowledge to facilitate the reader's comprehension of their respective roles in data mining. Rather, the book is a comprehensive introduction to data mining.

1『information retrieval 信息检索；数据挖掘的核心是发现模式 patterns。』

Data mining emerged during the late 1980s, made great strides during the 1990s, and continues to flourish into the new millennium. This book presents an overall picture of the field, introducing interesting data mining techniques and systems and discussing applications and research directions. An important motivation for writing this book was the need to build an organized framework for the study of data mining — a challenging task, owing to the extensive multidisciplinary nature of this fast-developing field. We hope that this book will encourage people with different backgrounds and experiences to exchange their views regarding data mining so as to contribute toward the further promotion and shaping of this exciting and dynamic field.

Organization of the Book. Since the publication of the first two editions of this book, great progress has been made in the field of data mining. Many new data mining methodologies, systems, and applications have been developed, especially for handling new kinds of data, including information networks, graphs, complex structures, and data streams, as well as text, Web, multimedia, time-series, and spatiotemporal data. Such fast development and rich, new technical contents make it difficult to cover the full spectrum of the field in a single book. Instead of continuously expanding the coverage of this book, we have decided to cover the core material in sufficient scope and depth, and leave the handling of complex data types to a separate forthcoming book.

1『spatiotemporal data 时间空间数据。』

The core technical material, which handles mining on general data types, is expanded and substantially enhanced. Several individual chapters for topics from the second edition (e.g., data preprocessing, frequent pattern mining, classification, and clustering) are now augmented and each split into two chapters for this new edition. For these topics, one chapter encapsulates the basic concepts and techniques while the other presents advanced concepts and methods.

Chapters from the second edition on mining complex data types (e.g., stream data, sequence data, graph-structured data, social network data, and multirelational data, as well as text, Web, multimedia, and spatiotemporal data) are now reserved for a new book that will be dedicated to advanced topics in data mining. Still, to support readers in learning such advanced topics, we have placed an electronic version of the relevant chapters from the second edition onto the book's web site as companion material for the third edition. The chapters of the third edition are described briefly as follows, with emphasis on the new material.

Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the multidisciplinary field of data mining. It discusses the evolutionary path of information technology, which has led to the need for data mining, and the importance of its applications. It examines the data types to be mined, including relational, transactional, and data warehouse data, as well as complex data types such as time-series, sequences, data streams, spatiotemporal data, multimedia data, text data, graphs, social networks, and Web data. The chapter presents a general classification of data mining tasks, based on the kinds of knowledge to be mined, the kinds of technologies used, and the kinds of applications that are targeted. Finally, major challenges in the field are discussed.

Chapter 2 introduces the general data features. It first discusses data objects and attribute types and then introduces typical measures for basic statistical data descriptions. It overviews data visualization techniques for various kinds of data. In addition to methods of numeric data visualization, methods for visualizing text, tags, graphs, and multidimensional data are introduced. Chapter 2 also introduces ways to measure similarity and dissimilarity for various kinds of data.

Chapter 3 introduces techniques for data preprocessing. It first introduces the concept of data quality and then discusses methods for data cleaning, data integration, data reduction, data transformation, and data discretization.

1『data discretization 数据离散化。』

Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 provide a solid introduction to data warehouses, OLAP (online analytical processing), and data cube technology. Chapter 4 introduces the basic concepts, modeling, design architectures, and general implementations of data warehouses and OLAP, as well as the relationship between data warehousing and other data generalization methods. Chapter 5 takes an in-depth look at data cube technology, presenting a detailed study of methods of data cube computation, including Star-Cubing and high-dimensional OLAP methods. Further explorations of data cube and OLAP technologies are discussed, such as sampling cubes, ranking cubes, prediction cubes, multifeature cubes for complex analysis queries, and discovery-driven cube exploration.

Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 present methods for mining frequent patterns, associations, and correlations in large data sets. Chapter 6 introduces fundamental concepts, such as market basket analysis, with many techniques for frequent itemset mining presented in an organized way. These range from the basic Apriori algorithm and its variations to more advanced methods that improve efficiency, including the frequent pattern growth approach, frequent pattern mining with vertical data format, and mining closed and max frequent itemsets. The chapter also discusses pattern evaluation methods and introduces measures for mining correlated patterns. Chapter 7 is on advanced pattern mining methods. It discusses methods for pattern mining in multilevel and multidimensional space, mining rare and negative patterns, mining colossal patterns and high-dimensional data, constraint-based pattern mining, and mining compressed or approximate patterns. It also introduces methods for pattern exploration and application, including semantic annotation of frequent patterns.

Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 describe methods for data classification. Due to the importance and diversity of classification methods, the contents are partitioned into two chapters. Chapter 8 introduces basic concepts and methods for classification, including decision tree induction, Bayes classification, and rule-based classification. It also discusses model evaluation and selection methods and methods for improving classification accuracy, including ensemble methods and how to handle imbalanced data. Chapter 9 discusses advanced methods for classification, including Bayesian belief networks, the neural network technique of backpropagation, support vector machines, classification using frequent patterns, k-nearest-neighbor classifiers, case-based reasoning, genetic algorithms, rough set theory, and fuzzy set approaches. Additional topics include multiclass classification, semi-supervised classification, active learning, and transfer learning.

Cluster analysis forms the topic of Chapter 10 and Chapter 11. Chapter 10 introduces the basic concepts and methods for data clustering, including an overview of basic cluster analysis methods, partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods, and grid-based methods. It also introduces methods for the evaluation of clustering. Chapter 11 discusses advanced methods for clustering, including probabilistic model-based clustering, clustering high-dimensional data, clustering graph and network data, and clustering with constraints.

Chapter 12 is dedicated to outlier detection. It introduces the basic concepts of outliers and outlier analysis and discusses various outlier detection methods from the view of degree of supervision (i.e., supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods), as well as from the view of approaches (i.e., statistical methods, proximity-based methods, clustering-based methods, and classification-based methods). It also discusses methods for mining contextual and collective outliers, and for outlier detection in high-dimensional data.

Finally, in Chapter 13, we discuss trends, applications, and research frontiers in data mining. We briefly cover mining complex data types, including mining sequence data (e.g., time series, symbolic sequences, and biological sequences), mining graphs and networks, and mining spatial, multimedia, text, and Web data. In-depth treatment of data mining methods for such data is left to a book on advanced topics in data mining, the writing of which is in progress. The chapter then moves ahead to cover other data mining methodologies, including statistical data mining, foundations of data mining, visual and audio data mining, as well as data mining applications. It discusses data mining for financial data analysis, for industries like retail and telecommunication, for use in science and engineering, and for intrusion detection and prevention. It also discusses the relationship between data mining and recommender systems. Because data mining is present in many aspects of daily life, we discuss issues regarding data mining and society, including ubiquitous and invisible data mining, as well as privacy, security, and the social impacts of data mining. We conclude our study by looking at data mining trends.

This book has several strong features that set it apart from other texts on data mining. It presents a very broad yet in-depth coverage of the principles of data mining. The chapters are written to be as self-contained as possible, so they may be read in order of interest by the reader. Advanced chapters offer a larger-scale view and may be considered optional for interested readers. All of the major methods of data mining are presented. The book presents important topics in data mining regarding multidimensional OLAP analysis, which is often overlooked or minimally treated in other data mining books. The book also maintains web sites with a number of online resources to aid instructors, students, and professionals in the field. These are described further in the following.

To the Student. We hope that this textbook will spark your interest in the young yet fast-evolving field of data mining. We have attempted to present the material in a clear manner, with careful explanation of the topics covered. Each chapter ends with a summary describing the main points. We have included many figures and illustrations throughout the text to make the book more enjoyable and reader-friendly. Although this book was designed as a textbook, we have tried to organize it so that it will also be useful to you as a reference book or handbook, should you later decide to perform in-depth research in the related fields or pursue a career in data mining. What do you need to know to read this book?

■ You should have some knowledge of the concepts and terminology associated with statistics, database systems, and machine learning. However, we do try to provide enough background of the basics, so that if you are not so familiar with these fields or your memory is a bit rusty, you will not have trouble following the discussions in the book.

■ You should have some programming experience. In particular, you should be able to read pseudocode and understand simple data structures such as multidimensional arrays.

To the Professional. This book was designed to cover a wide range of topics in the data mining field. As a result, it is an excellent handbook on the subject. Because each chapter is designed to be as standalone as possible, you can focus on the topics that most interest you. The book can be used by application programmers and information service managers who wish to learn about the key ideas of data mining on their own. The book would also be useful for technical data analysis staff in banking, insurance, medicine, and retailing industries who are interested in applying data mining solutions to their businesses. Moreover, the book may serve as a comprehensive survey of the data mining field, which may also benefit researchers who would like to advance the state-of-the-art in data mining and extend the scope of data mining applications.

The techniques and algorithms presented are of practical utility. Rather than selecting algorithms that perform well on small「toy」data sets, the algorithms described in the book are geared for the discovery of patterns and knowledge hidden in large, real data sets. Algorithms presented in the book are illustrated in pseudocode. The pseudocode is similar to the C programming language, yet is designed so that it should be easy to follow by programmers unfamiliar with C or C++. If you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you should find the translation of our pseudocode into the programming language of your choice to be a fairly straightforward task.

## 01. Introduction

### Summary

■ Necessity is the mother of invention. With the mounting growth of data in every application, data mining meets the imminent need for effective, scalable, and flexible data analysis in our society. Data mining can be considered as a natural evolution of information technology and a confluence of several related disciplines and application domains.





■ Data mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of data. As a knowledge discovery process, it typically involves data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, pattern discovery, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation.

■ A pattern is interesting if it is valid on test data with some degree of certainty, novel, potentially useful (e.g., can be acted on or validates a hunch about which the user was curious), and easily understood by humans. Interesting patterns represent knowledge. Measures of pattern interestingness, either objective or subjective, can be used to guide the discovery process.

■ We present a multidimensional view of data mining. The major dimensions are data, knowledge, technologies, and applications.

■ Data mining can be conducted on any kind of data as long as the data are meaningful for a target application, such as database data, data warehouse data, transactional data, and advanced data types. Advanced data types include time-related or sequence data, data streams, spatial and spatiotemporal data, text and multimedia data, graph and networked data, and Web data.

■ A data warehouse is a repository for long-term storage of data from multiple sources, organized so as to facilitate management decision making. The data are stored under a unified schema and are typically summarized. Data warehouse systems provide multidimensional data analysis capabilities, collectively referred to as online analytical processing.

■ Multidimensional data mining (also called exploratory multidimensional data mining) integrates core data mining techniques with OLAP-based multidimensional analysis. It searches for interesting patterns among multiple combinations of dimensions (attributes) at varying levels of abstraction, thereby exploring multidimensional data space.

■ Data mining functionalities are used to specify the kinds of patterns or knowledge to be found in data mining tasks. The functionalities include characterization and discrimination; the mining of frequent patterns, associations, and correlations; classification and regression; cluster analysis; and outlier detection. As new types of data, new applications, and new analysis demands continue to emerge, there is no doubt we will see more and more novel data mining tasks in the future.

■ Data mining, as a highly application-driven domain, has incorporated technologies from many other domains. These include statistics, machine learning, database and data warehouse systems, and information retrieval. The interdisciplinary nature of data mining research and development contributes significantly to the success of data mining and its extensive applications.

■ Data mining has many successful applications, such as business intelligence, Web search, bioinformatics, health informatics, finance, digital libraries, and digital governments.

■ There are many challenging issues in data mining research. Areas include mining methodology, user interaction, efficiency and scalability, and dealing with diverse data types. Data mining research has strongly impacted society and will continue to do so in the future.

This book is an introduction to the young and fast-growing field of data mining (also known as knowledge discovery from data, or KDD for short). The book focuses on fundamental data mining concepts and techniques for discovering interesting patterns from data in various applications. In particular, we emphasize prominent techniques for developing effective, efficient, and scalable data mining tools.

This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, you will learn why data mining is in high demand and how it is part of the natural evolution of information technology. Section 1.2 defines data mining with respect to the knowledge discovery process. Next, you will learn about data mining from many aspects, such as the kinds of data that can be mined (Section 1.3), the kinds of knowledge to be mined (Section 1.4), the kinds of technologies to be used (Section 1.5), and targeted applications (Section 1.6). In this way, you will gain a multidimensional view of data mining. Finally, Section 1.7 outlines major data mining research and development issues.
