## Author's Note

This book grew out of a puzzle I couldn’t solve.

In the spring of 2008, Joe Graedon, a host of the National Public Radio program The People’s Pharmacy, contacted me. In my decade reporting on the drug industry, I’d been a guest on his radio program a number of times. But this time he wanted my help. Patients had been calling and writing in to his program with serious complaints about generic drugs that either didn’t work or caused devastating side effects. The drugs, though made by different manufacturers and for a range of conditions from depression to heart disease, were all generic—less expensive versions of brand-name drugs, made legally after the patents on those medications lapsed.

Graedon had forwarded the patients’ complaints to top officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but they insisted that generics were equivalent to the brand and the patients’ reactions were subjective. Their response struck Graedon as more defensive than scientific. Generic drugs had become essential to balancing budgets across America. Without them, every large-scale government health program—the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part D, the Veterans Health Administration, charitable programs for Africa and the developing world—would be unaffordable. Graedon himself had long advocated making generic drugs more widely available. But the complaints were compelling and similar in nature. He felt that something significant was wrong with the drugs, but didn’t know what. He wanted someone with「investigative firepower」to look into the patients’ claims.

For years I’d reported on pharmaceuticals and public health as an investigative journalist. I had broken stories about brand-name drug companies, including efforts by opioid makers to increase sales by concealing addiction risks. In my first book, Dangerous Doses, I exposed how a shadowy gray market allowed pharmaceutical wholesalers to sell and resell our drugs, a practice that obscured their origin and opened the door to drug counterfeiters. To the extent that I’d thought about generic drugs, I knew they made up more than 60 percent of our drug supply (90 percent today) and were an essential counterweight to the ever-rising prices of brand-name drugs.

I began exactly where Graedon pointed me: with the patients. In June 2009, I published an article in Self magazine that documented how patients who had previously been stabilized on brand-name drugs relapsed when switched to certain generics. Their doctors had little data and no significant comparative studies to explain these reactions. Although the FDA reviewed data from the generic drug companies and inspected manufacturing plants, it was not systematically testing the drugs. As Dr. Nada Stotland, a psychiatrist in Chicago and then the president of the American Psychiatric Association, told me,「The FDA is satisfied that generics are okay. My question is, are we satisfied?」

Even as I worked on the article, I recognized its limits. Proving that patients were harmed might tell me that something was wrong with the drugs. But what? And even if I proved there was something wrong, why was that so? The answer to those questions almost certainly lay in the laboratories, manufacturing plants, and corporate boardrooms of the drug-making companies, many of which operated overseas. Roughly 40 percent of our generic drugs are manufactured in India. A full 80 percent of the active ingredients in all our drugs, whether brand-name or generic, are made in India and China. As one drug-ingredient importer told me,「Without products from overseas, not a single drug could be made.」

Ultimately, my effort to answer a single question—what is wrong with the drugs?—launched me into a decade-long reporting odyssey on four continents as I delved into how globalization had impacted the drugs we need to survive. In India, I sought out reluctant whistleblowers, visited manufacturing plants, and interviewed government officials. In China, as I endeavored to meet with sources, the government followed me, hacked my cell phone, and sent a photo of a security official sitting in my hotel lobby, holding up an English-language newspaper, to my phone’s home screen. It was an unmistakable warning: We are watching you. In a bar in Mexico City, a whistleblower slipped me stacks of internal communications from a generic drug company’s manufacturing plant. Doctors and scientists in Ghana met with me in hospitals and laboratories. In a manufacturing plant in Cork, Ireland, I watched as one of America’s most popular drugs, Lipitor, was manufactured.

I followed the trail of certain drugs around the world, trying to connect the dots. What had patients complained of? What had FDA investigators found? What actions had regulators taken? What had companies claimed? What had CEOs decided? What had criminal investigators turned up? I mined thousands of internal company documents, law enforcement records, FDA inspection records, and internal FDA communications, stacks of which piled up in my office.

My reporting led me into a maze of global deception. In 2013, I published a 10,000-word article on Fortune magazine’s U.S. website about fraud at India’s largest generic drug company. It detailed how the company had deceived regulators around the world by submitting fraudulent data that made its drugs appear bioequivalent to brand-name drugs. That article, however, left me with unanswered questions. Was that company an outlier or the tip of the iceberg? Did its conduct reflect a one-off scandal or an industry norm?

In my reporting, some important sources helped me answer that question. A generic drug executive contacted me anonymously under the pseudonym「4 Dollar Refill.」He explained that there was a gulf between what the regulations required of generic drug companies and how those companies behaved. To minimize costs and maximize profit, companies circumvented regulations and resorted to fraud: manipulating tests to achieve positive results and concealing or altering data to cover their tracks. By making the drugs cheaply without the required safeguards and then selling them into regulated and more costly Western markets, claiming that they had followed all the necessary regulations, companies could reap enormous profits.

An FDA consultant who had spent considerable time in overseas factories also contacted me. She was an expert at examining the cultural「data points,」or situational forces, that drive corporate behavior. One factor is company culture—the tone set by executives, the admonitions or slogans that hang on office or manufacturing-plant walls, the training that workers receive. If a company’s culture permits small lapses in safety regulations, catastrophic failure is all the more likely. As a pharmaceutical manufacturing executive put it,「When I get on a plane and there are cup stains on the tray table, you wonder if they’re taking care of the engine.」

But company culture is also affected by country culture, the FDA consultant explained: Is a society hierarchical or collaborative? Does it encourage dissent or demand deference to authority? These factors, though seemingly unrelated, can impact manufacturing quality and lead to variance between certain generics and brand-name drugs, as well as between generics that are supposedly interchangeable with one another, the consultant posited.

Before I embarked on this project, I had always assumed that a drug is a drug—that Lipitor, for example, or a generic version, is the same for any market in the world. And since generic drugs are required to be bioequivalent to the brand and to create a similar effect in the body, I assumed that there isn’t necessarily variation between different generic versions. I was wrong. Cheaply made pharmaceuticals hold up no better than cheap clothes or cheap electronics that are made swiftly in overseas sweatshops. Drugs reach the consumer「at a very low dollar price,」said the FDA consultant,「but perhaps at the expense of other principles for which it is difficult to measure a dollar value.」

Consumers understand that cheddar isn’t simply cheese, said the consultant. There’s「artisanal cheddar, Cabot cheddar, Velveeta, or a plastic block painted to look like cheese.」Unwittingly, patients face similar choices about quality every time they go to a drugstore. Yet because they have no idea such distinctions exist, they have no way to request one drug that is better than the next. Patients implicitly trust the FDA to ensure the high quality of their medicine. As a result, most patients do more due diligence when they change their cell-phone provider or buy a car, yet will walk into CVS「and not think for one second about what they put in their mouth that could kill them,」a lawyer who represented a pharmaceutical whistleblower told me.

We are dependent on distant drug manufacturers, yet have little visibility into their methods. In the factories where my reporting led, the FDA’s investigators are an infrequent presence and pressure for profits is intense. The result is a facade of compliance that papers over a darker reality.「It’s like it was at the turn of the twentieth century,」a Dutch pharmaceutical executive, who encountered a frog infestation at a manufacturing plant in China, told me.「It’s like The Jungle,」he said, referring to the book by Upton Sinclair that exposed gruesome conditions in America’s meatpacking plants.

There is no disputing the benefit of well-made generic drugs. When generics work perfectly, and many do, the results can be miraculous.「Basically, the ability of India and other countries to produce generic medicine at a fraction of the cost of the patented drugs saved the lives of millions of people in developing countries,」said Emi MacLean, formerly the U.S. director of the Access to Essential Medicines Campaign at Doctors Without Borders. The plunge in prices has also made medicine affordable and treatment possible for millions of Americans who have no alternative to generics without significant price regulation of brand-name drugs.

Generic drugs are essential to our health care system, and their quality is critical to us all. Nonetheless, in my effort to answer the question that Joe Graedon posed ten years ago—what is wrong with the drugs?—I uncovered the labyrinthine story of how the world’s greatest public health innovation also became one of its greatest swindles.

本书源于我无法解答的一个困惑。

2008 年春天，国家公共广播电台《人民药房》（The People' s Pharmacy）节目的主持人乔·格菜登（Joe Graedon）联系了我。我在报道制药业的 10 年里，曾多次到他的节目做客。但这一次，他是来求我帮忙的。他说不断有患者给他的节目打电话或写信，对仿制药提出强烈的投诉，他们说这些药要么没用，要么会引起极严重的不良反应。这些药物由不同的厂家生产，治疗从抑郁症到心脏病的各种疾病，共同之处在于它们都是仿制药，也就是在品牌药的专利过期之后，合法仿制出来的廉价版本。

格莱登将这些患者的投诉信转发给了美国食品药品管理局（US. Food and  Drug Administration，缩写 FDA，以下简称为美国药监局）的高层官员。但那些官员坚称仿制药和品牌药的效果完全相同，患者的反应太主观了。在格菜登看来，他们更像是在辩解，没有拿出实事求是的科学态度。在美国，仿制药在平衡预算方面功不可没。如果没有它们，任何一个大规模的政府卫生项目，比如平价医疗法案、联邦医疗保险处方药计划、退伍军人健康管理局以及各种援助非洲和发展中国家的慈善项目，都将变得难以负担。格莱登本人直在提倡扩大仿制药的适用范围，但是这些投诉不容忽视，而且性质都相似。他感觉这些药物出现了什么重大问题，但他也不知道问题是什么。他希望找一个拥有调研实力的人去査一査那些患者的投诉。

多年来，我一直在对药物和公共卫生问题进行调查报道。我曾揭露过品牌制药公司的不良行径，比如生产阿片类药物的厂家为了增加销量而隐瞒成瘾的风险。在我的第一本书《危险剂量》（Dangerous Doses）中，我揭露了在隐蔽的灰市上，药物批发商们如何对我们的药物一再转售，以此隐藏药物的源头，为假药制造者敞开了方便之门。说起仿制药，我只知道它们在我们的药物供应中占比超过六成（现在已占到九成），对价格不断上涨的品牌药起到了必不可少的平衡作用。

我顺着格登指示的方向开始了调査：患者。2009 年 6 月，我在《自我》杂志上发表了一篇文章，记录了一些患者使用品牌药时情况稳定，却在改用某些仿制药后病情复发的情况。他们的医生没有掌握多少数据，也缺乏有效的比较研究，因此无法解释这些反应。虽然美国药监局审核了那些仿制药公司提供的数据，也视察了他们的生产工厂，但是并没有系统性地检测那些药物。就像芝加哥的精神病医生、时任美国精神病学会主席的纳达·斯多特兰（Nada Stotland）对我说的那样：「美国药监局对结果很满意，觉得仿制药没问题。但问题是，我们觉得满意吗？」

我还在撰写那篇文章时，就已经认识到了这些审查的局限性。证明患者受到了危害或许能说明那些药物有问题，但那到底是什么问题呢？还有，即使我能证明那些药真有问题，又是什么原因造成的？这些问题的答案十有八九要到实验室、生产工厂和制药公司的会议室里去找，而其中许多都在海外运营。我们的仿制药，有大约 40% 在印度生产。无论是品牌药还是仿制药，我们所有的药物中足有 80% 的有效成分是在印度等国生产的。正如一个药品原料进口商告诉我的那样：「没有了这些海外产品，我们一种药都做不出来」。

我努力弄清一个问题的答案：我们的药出了什么问题？这最终使我踏上了一次为期 10 年的报道远征，我走访了四个大洲，去探访全球化如何影响了我们赖以生存的药物。在印度，我找到了几位不愿露面的举报人，参观了若干生产厂家，并采访了多名政府官员。在墨西哥城的一家酒吧，一位举报人偷偷递给我几沓纸，那都是一家仿制药公司厂房里的内部通讯录。在加纳，医生和科学家与我在医院和实验室会面。在爱尔兰科克郡的一家工厂里，我目睹在美国极受欢迎的一种药物 一一 立普妥的生产过程。我追踪了几种药物在全世界的踪迹，尝试从证据中理出头绪。患者投诉了什么？美国药监局的调査员又找到了什么？监管者采取了什么行动？制药公司又是怎么说的？公司的高管们做了什么决策？刑事调查员们又査出了什么？我在几千份公司内部文件、执法记录、美国药监局视察记录和内部通讯录中发掘，这些文档堆满了我的办公室。

这次报道过程领着我走进一场错综复杂的全球性骗局。2013 年，我在《财富》杂志的美国网站上发表了一篇万字长文，揭露印度最大的仿制药公司的欺骗行为。文中详述了这家公司是如何欺骗全世界监管者的：提交虚假数据，谎称其药物与品牌药具有生物等效性。然而这篇文章并没有完全解答我的疑惑：这家公司究竟是个例外，抑或只是冰山一角？其行径是一桩偶然的丑闻，还是已经成了行业的常态？其报道期间，一些重要的线人帮助我回答了这些问题。一位仿制药公司的高管化名「四美元加满」主动联系了我。他告诉我，监管机构对仿制药公司的要求和这些企业的实际行为之间隔着一道深渊。为了将成本降至最低、利润增至最大，这些企业会规避监管，诉诸诈骗：它们操纵检测以取得正面结果，隐瞒、篡改数据以掩盖形迹。这些企业在没有必要的安全保障的情况下生产低成本的药物，然后将这些药物销售到监管严格、价格较高的西方市场，他们宣称自己遵守了所有必要的规章，由此获得巨额利润。

还有一位曾在海外工厂待过很长时间的美国药监局顾问也联系了我。她的专长是研究文化性的「数据点」，或者说情境性的力量，正是这些力量驱动着企业的行为。其中一个要素是公司文化，包括高管设定的基调、悬挂在办公室或工厂墙壁上的警示语或者口号以及工人所受的培训。如果一家公司的文化允许轻度违反安全规章的行为存在，它就特别容易发生灾难性事故。正如一位在药厂负责生产的高管所说：「当我登上一架飞机，发现小餐桌板上有咖啡渍，我就会怀疑他们没有保养过引擎。」

不过，公司文化也受到国家文化的影响，那位美国药监局顾问做了解释：某个社会是层级性的还是合作性的，是鼓励异见还是要求服从权威，这些因素表面上和制药无关，其实可能会影响生产品质，并造成某些仿制药和品牌药之间的差异以及本可以互换的不同仿制药之间的差异，那位顾问如此猜想。

在我开始这次报道之前，我一直以为药就是药，像立普妥这样的药物，无论是不是仿制的，在全世界的任何一个市场都应该是一样的。既然按要求仿制药应该和品牌药具有生物等效性并且在人体内产生相似的作用，我想当然地认为不同版本的仿制药之间不该有任何差别。但是我错了。廉价生产的药物，在品质上并不比那些在海外的血汗工厂里赶制出来的便宜衣服或电子产品更可靠。那位美国药监局的顾问表示，药物卖到消费者手上确实「只要很少的几美元」，然而「其代价或许是其他一些难以估价的原则的沦丧」。

那位顾问说，消费者知道切达干酪不只是切达干酪，其中还有「工艺性切达、卡博特切达、加工奶酪，或者涂成了奶酪样子的塑料块」。但患者们不知道的是，每次他们走进一家药店，也在面临相似的选择。但因为他们不知道有这样的差别，所以无法选购一种品质较好的药物。患者打心底里相信美国药监局会确保药物的品质。就这样，大多数患者在更换手机服务商或购买汽车时还会细心调查一番，可是当他们走进药店时，「他们完全想不到自己塞进嘴里的东西可能致命」，一位代理药物举报人的律师这样对我说道。

我们的健康依赖于远方的制药厂，但我们很少知道他们的生产方式。我在报道中走访的那些工厂，美国药监局的调査员很少到访，盈利的压力异常强大。结果就是，在遵守规范的表面之下，还隐藏着一个黑暗的世界。荷兰的一位药企主管告诉我说：「就像是 20 世纪初的情況。」他曾在一家制药厂里见过一大群青蛙。「如同《屠宰场》（The Jungle）中所写的。」他指的是厄普顿·辛克菜（Upton Sinclair）揭露美国肉类加工厂可怕环境的名著。

那些优质仿制药带来的好处是谁也无法否认的。当仿制药具有理想的疗效（许多仿制药也确实如此），结果就如同奇迹。曾在无国界医生组织担任基本药物推广运动美国区主任的艾米·麦克菜恩（Emi Maclean）指出：「印度和其他国家生产的仿制药成本只有专利药的一个零头，这拯救了发展中国家数百万人的生命。」这种价格的落差也使几百万美国人买得起药，看得起病，由于美国对品牌药缺乏有效的价格管制，他们除了选择仿制药别无他法。

仿制药对于我们的医疗体系不可或缺，它们的品质对我们所有人都至关重要。然而，当我尝试回答乔·格菜登 10 年前提出的那个问题，即「我们的药出了什么问题」时，我揭示的却是一个错综复杂的故事，它讲述了这项世界最伟大的公共卫生创举是如何演变成一场举世少有的骗局的。

## About the Reporting

This book, including all the scenes, dialogue, and assertions in it, is based on extensive interviews, firsthand reporting, and documentation. I interviewed over 240 people, a number of them multiple times, including regulators, drug investigators, criminal investigators, diplomats, prosecutors, scientists, lawyers, public-health experts, doctors, patients, company executives, consultants, and whistleblowers. Primary reporting for this book took place between January 2014 and November 2018, and included on-the-ground reporting trips to India, China, Ghana, England, Ireland, and Mexico and travel throughout the United States. The book also includes material I gathered from 2008 to 2013, while reporting a series of articles about generic drugs in both Self and Fortune magazines.

In every scene with dialogue, I have reconstructed quotes from the recollections of participants as well as documentation, including meeting minutes, handwritten notes, and memoranda of interviews by criminal investigators. The quotes I use from emails and other documents are verbatim, and I have not corrected spelling errors. No names of characters have been changed.

In the course of reporting, I obtained a significant number of confidential documents. These include roughly 20,000 internal documents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including emails, memorandum, meeting minutes, reports, and data; thousands of internal government records related to the investigation of the generic drug company Ranbaxy; and thousands of internal corporate records from several generic drug companies, including emails, reports, strategy documents, correspondence, and sealed court records.

Documentation also came from sixteen Freedom of Information Act requests that I filed with the FDA, as well as from a lawsuit I filed to obtain calendar and meeting records for an FDA official. I also read through years of publicly available FDA inspection records.

Wherever an individual or company has chosen to respond to questions or allegations, relevant portions of their statements can be found incorporated into the book’s endnotes or main text. The endnotes are intended to guide readers to publicly available resources and documentation or to offer more detail on certain topic areas.

## Prologue

MARCH 18, 2013

Waluj

Aurangabad, India

Peter Baker, a drug investigator for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, traveled two hundred miles east of Mumbai, along a highway choked by truck traffic and down a road with meandering cows, to get to his assignment. Behind a metal fence lay a massive biotech park, run by the Indian generic drug company Wockhardt Ltd. Amid the dozens of buildings, Baker’s job was to inspect a particular area of the plant—Plot H-14/2—to ensure that it could safely make a sterile injectable drug used by American cancer patients.

Baker, thirty-three, had arrived lightly provisioned. He had just a few items in his backpack: a camera, a gel-ink pen, a green U.S. government–issued notebook, and his FDA identification. He had a graduate degree in analytical chemistry and a command of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, the rules that governed drug manufacturing. But more importantly, he had his instincts: a strong sense of what to check and where to look, after completing eighty-one inspections over four and a half years at the FDA.

At 9:00 a.m., the sun already burning, Baker and his colleague, an FDA microbiologist, showed their identification to guards at the gate and were ushered into the plant, where the vice president of manufacturing and other company officials waited anxiously to greet them. In a world of drab auditors toiling with checklists, Baker stood out. He was handsome and energetic. He wore his brownish-blond hair in a buzz cut. On one bicep, he sported the oversized tattooed initials of his motorcycle group. As the officials began their opening presentation, he interrupted with a staccato burst of questions. Was there any other manufacturing area on-site that made sterile drugs for the U.S. market, aside from Plot H-14/2? he asked repeatedly. No, the officials assured him.

Baker’s job—part science and part detective work—had been transformed by the forces of globalization. From 2001 to 2008, the number of drug products imported into the United States had doubled. By 2005, the FDA had more drug plants to inspect abroad than it did within U.S. borders. Baker had been dispatched to Wockhardt, in an industrial area of Aurangabad, because of a global deal that had evolved over more than a decade. Drug makers in India and other countries gained entry to the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the world’s largest and most profitable. In return, the American public got access to affordable versions of lifesaving drugs. But this boon came with a serious caveat: foreign drug manufacturers had to comply with the intensive U.S. regulations known as「current good manufacturing practices」(cGMP) and submit to regular inspections. If everything went according to plan, the result was a win-win for foreign drug makers and American consumers alike.

Though few Americans knew Wockhardt by name, many took its medicine. The company manufactured about 110 different generic drug products for the American market, including a beta blocker—metoprolol succinate—to treat hypertension, which reached about a quarter of U.S. patients taking a generic version of the drug. Because the Aurangabad plant manufactured sterile injectable medicine, the regulations it had to follow were particularly strict.

Every detail mattered. Every digit of data had to be preserved in its original form. As one moved closer to the plant’s sterile core, where vials of medicine sat exposed, the rules became even more restrictive. Employees there had to move slowly and deliberately, so as not to disturb the unidirectional air flow. Even to take notes, FDA investigators had to use sterile, lint-free paper. There was a good reason for these rules. One small slip—a failure to filter air properly, a misreading of bacterial samples, the exposed wrist of a technician—could result in a contaminated product that would kill instead of cure.

Given the high stakes—lives on one side, and profits on the other—fear governed the inspection. Baker feared that he would miss something that would endanger the lives of U.S. patients. Wockhardt officials feared that he would find something that would restrict the company’s access to the U.S. market. They needed every advantage to survive the FDA’s inspection. Here, Wockhardt had several things stacked in its favor. The plant was massive, roughly the size of a small city. Baker and his colleague had just one week to inspect the site. With only five working days, how much could they find?

But Wockhardt had an even bigger advantage. Company executives had known for weeks that Baker was coming to inspect their factory. In the United States, FDA investigators simply showed up unannounced and stayed as long as was needed. But for overseas inspections—due to the complex logistics of getting visas and ensuring access to the plant—the FDA had chosen a different approach: to announce its inspections in advance. As was typical, Wockhardt had「invited」the FDA to inspect and the agency had accepted. Plant officials served as hosts and Baker was their guest—albeit one whose arrival they dreaded.

Given weeks of lead time, the officials worked feverishly to prepare for Baker’s arrival. They polished floors, cleaned equipment, and combed through files to rid them of anomalies. They warned their employees to remain polite but silent, and to let their supervisors answer questions. They had fixed everything in every place where investigators were likely to look, a drill they’d endured fifteen months earlier when a different inspection team had arrived from the FDA.

On that visit, the investigators had found some troubling shortcomings: live bugs in a water storage tank, flooring in disrepair, ineffective cleaning procedures. But the investigators had recommended, not demanded, that the plant make corrections. In the FDA’s coding system, they had given the plant a passing grade, one known as「Voluntary Action Indicated」(VAI). This meant that the Wockhardt operation had survived the inspection with no restriction to its most lucrative franchise—the sale of drugs to the United States.

This time, though company officials had planned for an inspection, they had not planned for Peter Baker. Unlike so many other FDA investigators, he was hard to prepare for—and control. He wouldn’t tolerate an opening slide show or a guided tour, which were typical ways for plant officials to run down the clock. He seemed to be everywhere at once. He studied the employees for signs of evasion as he questioned them repeatedly. Company officials quickly ascertained that his visit posed a serious threat, one that would require drastic action on their part if the plant was to emerge unscathed.

On the second day of his inspection, Baker and his colleague entered a hallway far from the sensitive areas of the facility. It was a place where he could let down his guard. But as he looked down the long, gleaming corridor, he noticed a man at the far end who was walking toward him just a little too quickly. The man, a plant employee, had a furtive demeanor. In one hand, he carried a clear garbage bag full of papers and assorted refuse, making his hurried walk seem even stranger. As the man glanced up, he noticed Baker and momentarily froze. The two men locked eyes.

Abruptly, the man pivoted and returned the way he had come. Baker followed him, quickening his pace. The employee sped up, too, until the two men were engaged in a low-speed chase beneath the fluorescent lights.

「Stop!」yelled Baker’s colleague, the microbiologist. The man broke into an open run. As he bolted, the investigators gave chase until the employee flung open a side door, careened from the hallway, and hurled the bag onto a pile of garbage in a dim storage area beneath a stairwell, then scrambled up a flight of stairs and vanished into the building’s concrete maze.

Baker, close behind, retrieved the bag. Inside, he discovered roughly seventy-five manufacturing records for the company’s insulin products. They had been hastily torn in half, but he was able to piece some together. As he did, his concern grew. They revealed that many of the vials contained black particles, potentially deadly contaminants, and had failed visual inspection.

Under good manufacturing practices, every record created at the plant had to be made available to regulators. But these documents were marked「for internal dept. use only.」Baker suspected that the records were secret for a reason. The testing results were so bad that, had they been disclosed, the plant would have had to launch a costly internal investigation and likely reject every batch it produced.

Over the next three days, Baker demanded that Wockhardt officials open their computers, as was his right, and he began scouring records. One by one, he uncovered the company’s deceptions. As he suspected, the records from the garbage bag had not been logged into the company’s official system. The drugs flagged in the records had been released to patients in India and the Middle East. Baker discovered that the drugs had been manufactured in a secret formulation area that the FDA had never known about or inspected. Once he arrived there, he learned that Wockhardt had used the same defective equipment, in the same secret area, to make medicine for the U.S. market—including the injectable drug adenosine, which treated irregular heartbeat.

The result was a disaster for Wockhardt. Two months after Baker’s inspection, the FDA restricted the import of drugs from the Waluj plant into the United States, a potential $100 million loss in sales for the company. The next day, Wockhardt’s CEO held an emergency conference call with anxious investors to assure them that the company would bring the plant into compliance「in a month or two months maximum.」

At a glance, the plant appeared perfectly run, the equipment shiny and new, its procedures meticulous and compliant. But the torn records Baker had uncovered led him beneath the plant’s impeccable surface and into a labyrinth of lies, where nothing was what it appeared to be. The records were false. Drugs were manufactured in a secret area. Some of them contained visible contaminants that endangered patients. Baker, who had pieced all this together over the course of five punishing days, was left to wonder: if so much inside this plant was fake, what, if anything, was real?

2013 年 3 月 18 日

瓦鲁吉奥兰加巴德，印度

彼得·贝克（Peter Baker）是美国药监局的一名药物调查员，他从孟买出发向东行 200 英里，先是经过一条挤满卡车的高速公路，再经过一条有奶牛漫步的小路，才到达他的任务地点。他的目的地位于一道金属栅栏后面，那里有一片巨大的生物科技园区，经营它的是印度仿制药公司沃克哈特有限公司。在那几十座建筑中间，贝克的工作是检查一个专门的工厂区域 —— H-142 地块，以确保它能安全地生产一种无菌注射剂，供美国的癌症患者使用。

贝克今年 33 岁，到这里时一身轻装。他的背包里只有几件装备：一部相机、一支中性墨水笔、一本美国政府发的绿色笔记本，还有他的美国药监局证件。他拥有分析化学硕学位，精通专门规范药物生产的美国《联邦法规汇编》第 21 篇（以下简称「CFR21」）。但是最重要的是，他带上了他的直觉：他在美国药监局工作了四年半，共完成了 81 次视察，对于该查什么去哪里查，他已经有了灵敏的直觉。

早上 9 点已经赤日炎炎，贝克和他的同事位美国药监局的微生物学家，在园区门口向保安亮明了身份，随即被领进工厂。在那里，负责生产总裁和其他公司干部正焦急地准备迎接他们。在一个审计员吭哧吭哧地核对清单的乏味世界里，贝克显得卓尔不群。他相貌俊朗，精力充沛，泛褐色的金发剪成寸头，还在一侧二头肌上用大大的字刺着他那个摩托车俱乐部的首字母。当公司的干部们开始介绍时，他不时进出一串问题打断对方。他反复问道，除了 H-142 地块，这里还有没有别的区域在为美国市场生产无菌药？没有了，部们向他保证。

贝克的工作是科研和侦探的结合，这已经为全球化的力量所改变。从 2001 年到 2008 年，进口到美国的药物制品翻了一番。到 2005 年，美国药监局在海外视察的药厂数量已经超过美国境内 [2]。贝克会被派到位于奥兰加巴德工业区的沃克哈特公司，是因为过去 10 多年中形成的一项全球协议。根据那项协议，印度和其他国家的制药公司得以进入美国药品市场，也就是全世界规模最大、利润最高的药品市场。而美国民众则获得了负担得起的救命药。但这项福利也附带了一项限制条件：国外制药公司必须遵循美国制定的名为「现行良好生产规范」（current Good Manufacturing Practice，缩写 cGMP）的严格规范，并且定期接受视察。如果一切按照计划进行，那就会形成外国药企和美国消费者双赢的局面。

1『这里算是稍微了解到 GMP 的由来，上面的这段信息做一张任意卡片。』——已完成

虽然「沃克哈特」这个名字很少有美国人知道，但许多人都用过它的药。这家公司为美国市场生产大约 110 种不同的仿制药物，包括一种治疗高血压的 B 受体阻滞剂 一一 琥珀酸美托洛尔（metoprolol succinate）。在使用这种药物的仿制版的美国患者中，有大约四分之一用的是沃克哈特的产品。奥兰加巴德的这家药厂生产的是无菌注射剂，因此它必须遵守特别严格的规章。

在这里，每一个细节都很要紧。每一项数据都必须用原来的格式保存。走入厂房的无菌核心区，越接近那个摆放着敞口药剂瓶的区域，规章也变得越严格。员工们必须缓慢移动，小心翼翼，以免扰动单向的气流。就连记笔记时，美国药监局的调查员也必须使用无菌且不起毛的纸张。制定这些规章是有充分理由的：在这个地方只要稍有闪失，比如没能正确地过滤空气，读错了细菌样本，或是技术员露出了手腕，都可能造成污染，使原来救人的产品变成杀人的产品。

因为极高的风险（一边是生命，一边是利润），这次视察的各方都被恐惧所笼罩。贝克害怕会看漏什么，由此危害美国患者的性命。沃克哈特的干部们害怕他会发现什么，由此限制公司进入美国市场。他们需要充分的优势，才能过这次美国药监局视察的关。但是沃克哈特已经具备了几项优势：他们的工厂够大，规模接近一座小城，而贝克和同事的视察时间只有一周。短短五个工作日内，谅他们能发现多少问题？

沃克哈特还有一项更大的优势：早在几周之前，公司的高管们就知道贝克要来视察工厂了。在美国，美国药监局的调查员可以不打招呼就到工厂视察，需要待多久就待多久。然而海外视察不同，因为申请签证和联系进入厂区都要经过复杂的环节，美国药监局采取了另一种做法：提前宣布。根据常规程序，沃克哈特公司先「邀请」美国药监局前去视察，美国药监局再接受邀请。工厂的干部们是主人，而贝克是宾客 —— 虽说这位宾客的光临很令他们害怕。

在之前的几周里，这些干部加倍努力地为贝克的到来做准备。他们擦亮地板，清设备，梳理文件，排查反常的地方。他们提醒员工要保持礼貌而沉默的态度，把问题交给主管来回答。在调查员可能查看的地方，他们把切都安排妥当了，这都是他们在 15 个月前练出来的本事，当时曾有另一支美国药监局队伍来厂里视察。

在那次视察中，调査员们发现了几个令人担忧的问题：一个储水罐里有活虫，地板破损失修，清洁程序也失效。但调员们没有强下命令，只是建议工厂改进。在美国药监局的编码系统中，他们给工厂打了一个及格分，即「自主行动指示」（Voluntary Action Indicated，缩写 VA）。也就是说，沃克哈特公司的运营通过了视察，其最赚钱的业务一向美国出售药品，不会受到限制了。

虽然这一次干部们也为视察做了准备，但他们没有料到来的是彼得·贝克。不像别的许多美国药监局调查员，贝克这个人很难防备，也很难对付。他不会容忍工厂一上来就给他放幻灯片，或是带着他参观一圈，而那都是工厂干部们拖延时间的典型做法。他在工厂里显得神出鬼没。他会反复盘问员工，同时在他们的言行中寻找闪避的迹象。公司干部们很快就认定他的到来会造成严重威胁，要想保全工厂，就得用激烈的手段应对。

视察第二天，贝克和同事走进一条远离工厂敏感区域的过道。在这个地方他可以暂时放松警惕了。可是当他顺着长长的、锃亮的走廊望过去时，却发现彼端有个男人正朝这个方向走来，脚步似乎有些匆忙。那个男人是工厂的一名员工，一副鬼鬼祟祟的样子。他的一只手里提着一个透明垃圾袋，里面塞满纸张和各种废弃物，这使他匆忙的脚步显得更可疑了。男子抬头望向这边看到贝克就立刻僵住了。两人的眼神交会在了一起。

突然，男人转身沿着来路走去。贝克加快脚步跟了上去。那名员工也加快了速度。荧光灯下，两个男人展开了一场竞走比赛。「站住！」贝克的同事 —— 那位微生物学家喊了一声。男子撒腿就跑。两名调查员也奔跑着追了上去。男子猛地推开一扇侧门，神到走廊外面，把垃圾袋往楼梯井下一扔，它掉在了一个昏暗的储藏区里的一堆垃圾上。然后男子手脚并用爬上一段楼梯，消失在了建筑物的混凝土迷宫里。

紧跟在后面的贝克寻回了袋子。他从中发现了公司大约 5 页的胰岛素产品生产记录。它们都被匆忙撕成了两半，但还是可以拼成原样。拼着拼着，贝克的担忧越来越重了。这些记录显示，许多药瓶里面都出现了黑色颗粒，是可能致命的污染物，它们没有通过目视检测。

按照良好生产规范，工厂做的每一页记录都要交给监管者过目。但眼前的这批文件却标着「仅供内部使用」。贝克猜想，对这些记录保密是有原因的。它们说明药物的检测结果极其糟糕，一旦被披露，工厂就必须开展一次昂贵的内部调查，可能还要将所有批次都列为次品。

接下来的三天，贝克行使了自己的权威，他要求沃克哈特的干部们打开各自的电脑，让他搜查其中的记录。一个接着一个，他发现了公司的骗局。正如他所怀疑的那样，那个垃圾袋里的记录没有录入公司的正式系统。而记录中标记的药物已经卖给了印度和中东的患者。贝克发现这些药物是在一个隐秘的配方区生产的，美国药监局根本不知道有这么个地方，也从来没有视察过。贝克去了那里，发现沃克哈特公司曾经在同样的秘密区域、用同样残破的设备为美国市场生产药物，包括治疗心律不齐的注射药物 一一 腺苷（adenosine）。

这次视察使沃克哈特公司倒了大霉。两个月后，美国药监局宣布限制从瓦鲁吉工厂进口药物 [6]，这对公司的销售额造成了 1 亿美元的潜在损失。第二天，沃克哈特的 CEO 就召开了一场紧急电话会议，他向焦虑的投资者们保证，公司会在「一个月、最多两个月后」使工厂符合美国药监局的规章。

表面上看，这家工厂运营完善，设备崭新发亮，流程一丝不苟，符合章程。但是贝克发现的那些被撕碎的记录，却领着他潜入工厂无可挑别的表象之下，进入了一座谎言的迷官，在这里，一切都不是表面看到的样子。记录是假的。药物是在秘密区域生产的。有的药物包含肉眼可见的污染物，会威胁患者的生命。贝克用了五天时间，费尽心力调查出这一切。这个结果让他不禁疑惑：如果这家工厂里有这么多东西是假的，那什么又是真的？还有真的吗？
