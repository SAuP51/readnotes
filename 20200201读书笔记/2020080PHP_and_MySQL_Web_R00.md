### 02

为了备战面试：我没有考上理想的研究院，就业的压力再一次摆在了我的面前。记得当初做毕业设计使用的 asp.net2.0 技术，发现网上已经开始使用 3.0+ 了。而且又在网上看到，说用 .net 做网站的程序员挣不了多少钱。再加上，我也不太喜欢 visual studio（我讨厌自动生成模板，就像《程序员修炼之道》中‘邪恶的向导’所提到的一样）。这时，我想到了另一种语言 php（大学没接触 jsp 或是什么别的语言了）。那是距离我规定的找工作时间还有一个多月，我又一次拿出了这本书，开始从头看起。书的内容不用说自然是一本好书，从最简单的 php 标记开始讲起，然后的变量，逻辑，操作符，读写文件，使用数组，正则表达式，处理字符串，最后的面向对象的基本支持。讲完 php 后开始教授 mysql，然后是一些我认为的废话（电子商务与安全性），再然后的一些进阶的 php 知识，包括文件上传，网络函数，日期管理，创建图片，会话控制等，最后是一大堆的实例。因为时间的关系，我实现了购物车功能的那个实例（当时看到了 500 页）就急匆匆的开始投简历去了。

小小的打击： 记得当时面试 ZOL 时我还特意拿着这本书，面试官看我没有任何的工作经验，就把我叫到了一旁，问我：你虽然没有工作经验，但公司很喜欢你身上那种精神，你和另外两位已经进入了最后一轮面试。当时真没想到自己会这么幸运。我们三个人进入了一个小小的房间，面试官是 cto。在几个试探性的问题后，他看出了我的技术经验不足，从他的眼神中我看到，他想给我机会，但是我还不能达到他的目标。他看了我一眼，说：好吧，我问大家最后一个问题。如果我想用 mysql 降序排列一组数据，我该如何办？ 他手指指向我，让我第一个回答，显然这个问题对于另外两个人实在是太简单了。他希望通过我回答出这个问题，给我一次在这里工作的机会。我想了一下，说： 用 select top 然后跟。。。。他打断了我，并让另外两个人回答。显然我的答案是错的。就这样我的第一次面试失败了。出来后我翻遍了一整本书都没有找到为什么不能用 top（我把 mysql 和 sqlserver 记混了）。这件事情告诉我，学习任何技术一定要踏实，在去尝试新技术之前，应该熟练掌握已学习的知识。让他们变得更加的扎实！

遗忘： 我运气好，没经过太多波折就找到了一份工作，在那里干了二年三个月的时间。工作的压力让我淡忘了自己对 php 基础知识的不足。更多的时间拖入到跟框架有关的工作中，也没有在意自己的底子是不是扎实。那时候就想说，把工作任务先完成，书以后再学。就这样，两年的时间一下子就过去了。

重逢： 当我再次拿起他的时候，已经是我决定要离开第一家公司的时候。我希望可以去更加有发展的公司，但我也想起了第一次面试留给我的惨痛的经验教训。我现在应该把基础打牢！ 所以我再一次从书柜里面拿出了他。再一次从第一页开始读起，不管内容多么简单，我也认真的学习。虽然现在看来，后面的实例已经显得不那么实用，传授的知识也是很基础的，但是每当我翻开他的时候，看到的不仅仅是一个个知识点，更多的是当时学习 php 时的自己的模样。

[PHP和MySQL Web应用开发核心技术](https://book.douban.com/subject/1824542/)

上面这个链接的书名字叫《PHP 和 MySQL Web 应用开发核心技术》（以后我们简称「web 核心」），不管是名字还是书皮都跟这本书非常像，如果你都读过的话，会感觉里面的章节安排也是非常像的。我评论的这本书（以后简称「web 开发」，和「web 核心」区分开）由于被他的「圣经」光环所笼罩，所以当我拿到「web 核心」这本书的时候，感觉他其实就是在抄袭「web 开发」，不值得去阅读，但是当我有一次无意读了他其中的某些章节的时候，我感觉「web 核心」比「web 开发」更胜一筹，具体哪里更好，我现在已经无法细数了，现在只是留有印象：前者比后者讲的更清楚明白，项目开发中的经验讲的更多，新技术新思想也涉及的更多等等。

如果还要深入研究的话，上面两本书都不够，推荐下面这本书，PHP 5 权威编程：[PHP 5权威编程](https://book.douban.com/subject/2981954/)。里面的代码优化和扩展开发部分对想深入学习的人非常有用！

《PHP 和 MySQL Web 开发》（SAMS）风格类似散文，精髓就是形散神不散，牢牢抓住「web 开发」的主旨，粗看前两篇（记得是 1-14 章）会让人感觉「东一榔头西一棒」，提了下显示动态内容，即刻就带到使用函数。这粗看让人觉得有些乱，但实际上这种写作风格却更好的体现了本书作者的思想，他把实践看的很重，所以几乎每篇每节都是围绕一个实例在做诠释，而因此本书的精髓则在后三篇。但正如上面一位老师说的，它没有详细的函数说明。

《PHP 与 MySQL 5 程序设计》（Apress）则是「说明文」，详细严谨的逐步解释每个概念，本书的读者能够了解并熟悉 php 和 mysql 技术中的各个细节，这非常适合刚入门的初学者，甚至你无需了解更多的相关内容（如 asp，c 语言）就能够看懂本书。而讲到的各个细节，则是说本书对函数做了大篇幅的说明，这是本书的一个特色。

## 前言

Welcome to PHP and MySQL Web Development. Within its pages, you will find distilled knowledge from our experiences using PHP and MySQL, two of the most important and widely used web development tools around. Key topics covered in this introduction include: 1) Why you should read this book. 2) What you will be able to achieve using this book. 3) What PHP and MySQL are and why they’re great. 4) What’s changed in the latest versions of PHP and MySQL. 5) How this book is organized.

Why You Should Read This Book. This book will teach you how to create interactive web applications from the simplest order form through to complex, secure web applications. What’s more, you’ll learn how to do it using open-source technologies. We wrote the first edition of this book because we were tired of finding PHP books that were basically function references. These books are useful, but they don’t help when your boss or client has said,「Go build me a shopping cart.」In this book, we have done our best to make every example useful. You can use many of the code samples directly in your website, and you can use many others with only minor modifications.

What You Will Learn from This Book. Reading this book will enable you to build real-world, dynamic web applications. If you’ve built websites using plain HTML, you realize the limitations of this approach. Static content from a pure HTML website is just that — static. It stays the same unless you physically update it. Your users can’t interact with the site in any meaningful fashion. Using a language such as PHP and a database such as MySQL allows you to make your sites dynamic: to have them be customizable and contain real-time information.

1『使用「PHP and a database」可以实现动态网页。』

We have deliberately focused this book on real-world applications, even in the introductory chapters. We begin by looking at simple systems and work our way through the various parts of PHP and MySQL. We then discuss aspects of security and authentication as they relate to building a real-world website and show you how to implement these aspects in PHP and MySQL. We also introduce you to integrating front-end and back-end technologies by discussing JavaScript and the role it can play in your application development.

1『前端和后端技术的英文名找到了，「front-end」和「back-end」。』

In the final part of this book, we describe how to approach real-world projects and take you through the design, planning, and building of the following projects: 1) User authentication and personalization. 2) Web-based email. 3) Social media integration.

You should be able to use any of these projects as is, or you can modify them to suit your needs. We chose them because we believe they represent some the most common web  applications built by programmers. If your needs are different, this book should help you along the way to achieving your goals.

What Is PHP? PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for the web. Within an HTML page, you can embed PHP code that will be executed each time the page is visited. Your PHP code is interpreted at the web server and generates HTML or other output that the visitor will see.

1『PHP 是服务端的脚本语言，其代码是在服务器端解释完成的，然后以 HTML 的格式返回给客户端，比如浏览器。PHP 是开源的。』

PHP was conceived in 1994 and was originally the work of one man, Rasmus Lerdorf. It was adopted by other talented people and has gone through several major rewrites to bring us the broad, mature product we see today. According to Google’s Greg Michillie in May 2013, PHP ran more than three quarters of the world’s websites, and that number had grown to over 82% by July 2016. PHP is an open-source project, which means you have access to the source code and have the freedom to use, alter, and redistribute it. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page but was changed in line with the GNU recursive naming convention (GNU = Gnu’s Not Unix) and now stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor.

The current major version of PHP is 7. This version saw a complete rewrite of the underlying Zend engine and some major improvements to the language. All of the code in this book has been tested and validated against the most recent release of PHP 7 at the time of writing, as well as the latest version in the PHP 5.6 family of releases, which is still officially supported.

What Is MySQL? MySQL (pronounced My-Ess-Que-Ell) is a very fast, robust, relational database management system (RDBMS). A database enables you to efficiently store, search, sort, and retrieve data. The MySQL server controls access to your data to ensure that multiple users can work with it concurrently, to provide fast access to it, and to ensure that only authorized users can obtain access. Hence, MySQL is a multiuser, multithreaded server. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL), the standard database query language. MySQL has been publicly available since 1996 but has a development history going back to 1979. It is the world’s most popular open-source database and has won the Linux Journal Readers’ Choice Award on a number of occasions.

1『1）数据库可以让我们非常有效的存储、搜索、排序和提取数据。2）数据能让很多人同访问数据，而且可以给让问的人设置不同的权限。』

Why Use PHP and MySQL? When setting out to build a website, you could use many different products. You need to choose the following: 1) Where to run your web servers: the cloud, virtual private servers, or actual hardware. 2) An operating system. 3) Web server software. 4) A database management system or other datastore. 5) A programming or scripting language.

You may end up with a hybrid architecture with multiple datastores. Some of these choices are dependent on the others. For example, not all operating systems run on all hardware, not all web servers support all programming languages, and so on. In this book, we do not pay much attention to hardware, operating systems, or web server software. We don’t need to. One of the best features of both PHP and MySQL is that they work with any major operating system and many of the minor ones.

The majority of PHP code can be written to be portable between operating systems and web servers. There are some PHP functions that specifically relate to the filesystem that are operating system dependent, but these are clearly marked as such in the manual and in this book. Whatever hardware, operating system, and web server you choose, we believe you should seriously consider using PHP and MySQL.

Some of PHP’s Strengths. Some of PHP’s main competitors are Python, Ruby (on Rails or otherwise), Node.js, Perl, Microsoft .NET, and Java. In comparison to these products, PHP has many strengths, including the following:

1) Performance. PHP is very fast. Using a single inexpensive server, you can serve millions of hits per day. It scales down to the smallest email form and up to sites such as Facebook and Etsy. 2) Scalability. PHP has what Rasmus Lerdorf frequently refers to as a「shared-nothing」architecture. This means that you can effectively and cheaply implement horizontal scaling with large numbers of commodity servers. 3) Database Integration. PHP has native connections available to many database systems. In addition to MySQL, you can directly connect to PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and MSSQL, among others. PHP 5 and PHP 7 also have a built-in SQL interface to flat files, called SQLite. Using the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) standard, you can connect to any database that provides an ODBC driver. This includes Microsoft products and many others. In addition to native libraries, PHP comes with a database access abstraction layer called PHP Database Objects (PDOs), which allows consistent access and promotes secure coding practices.

4) Built-in Libraries. Because PHP was designed for use on the Web, it has many built-in functions for performing many useful web-related tasks. You can generate images on the fly, connect to web services and other network services, parse XML, send email, work with cookies, and generate PDF documents, all with just a few lines of code. 5) Cost. PHP is free. You can download the latest version at any time from http://www.php.net for no charge. 6) Ease of Learning PHP. The syntax of PHP is based on other programming languages, primarily C and Perl. If you already know C or Perl, or a C-like language such as C++ or Java, you will be productive using PHP almost immediately.

1『由于是针对 web 开发的语言，它内置的很多函数跟 web 相关，所以做这些任务就很方便，比如生成图片、连接网络服务、解析 XML、发送邮件、cookies 相关、生成 pdf 等。』

7) Object-Oriented Support. PHP version 5 had well-designed object-oriented features, which continued to be refined and improved in PHP version 7. If you learned to program in Java or C++, you will find the features (and generally the syntax) that you expect, such as inheritance, private and protected attributes and methods, abstract classes and methods, interfaces, constructors, and destructors. You will even find some less common features such as iterators and traits. 8) Portability. PHP is available for many different operating systems. You can write PHP code on free UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and FreeBSD, commercial UNIX versions, OS X, or on different versions of Microsoft Windows. Well-written code will usually work without modification on a different system running PHP. 9) Flexibility of Development Approach. PHP allows you to implement simple tasks simply, and equally easily adapts to implementing large applications using a framework based on design patterns such as Model-View-Controller (MVC).

10) Source Code. You have access to PHP’s source code. With PHP, unlike commercial, closed-source products, if you want to modify something or add to the language, you are free to do so. You do not need to wait for the manufacturer to release patches. You also don’t need to worry about the manufacturer going out of business or deciding to stop supporting a product. 11) Availability of Support and Documentation. Zend Technologies ([Enterprise PHP | Zend by Perforce](https://www.zend.com/)), the company behind the engine that powers PHP, funds its PHP development by offering support and related software on a commercial basis. The PHP documentation and community are mature and rich resources with a wealth of information to share.

Key Features of PHP 7. In December 2015, the long-awaited PHP 7 release was made available to the public. As mentioned in this introduction, the book covers both PHP 5.6 and PHP 7, which might lead you to ask「what happened to PHP 6?」The short answer is: there is no PHP 6 and never was for the general public. There was a development effort around a codebase that was referred to as「PHP 6」but it never came to fruition; there were many ambitious plans and subsequent complications that made it difficult for the team to continue to pursue. PHP 7 is not PHP 6 and doesn’t include the features and code from that development effort; PHP 7 is its own release with its own focus — specifically a focus on performance.

Under the hood, PHP 7 includes a refactor of the Zend Engine that powers it, which resulted in a significant performance boost to many web applications — sometimes upwards of 100%! While increased performance and decreased memory use were key to the release of PHP 7, so was backward-compatibility. In fact, relatively few backward-incompatible language changes were introduced. These are discussed contextually throughout this book so that the chapters remain usable with PHP 5.6 or PHP 7, as widespread adoption of PHP 7 has not yet occurred by commercial web-hosting providers.

Some of MySQL’s Strengths. MySQL’s main competitors in the relational database space are PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle. There is also a growing trend in the web application world toward use of NoSQL/non-relational databases such as MongoDB. Let’s take a look at why MySQL is still a good choice in many cases. MySQL has many strengths, including the following:

1『非关系数据库的代表是 MongoDB。』

1) Performance. MySQL is undeniably fast. You can see the developers’ benchmark page at http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/benchmarks/. 2) Low Cost. MySQL is available at no cost under an open-source license or at low cost under a commercial license. You need a license if you want to redistribute MySQL as part of an application and do not want to license your application under an open-source license. If you do not intend to distribute your application — typical for most web applications — or are working on free or open-source software, you do not need to buy a license. 3) Ease of Use. Most modern databases use SQL. If you have used another RDBMS, you should have no trouble adapting to this one. MySQL is also easier to set up and tune than many similar products.

4) Portability. MySQL can be used on many different UNIX systems as well as under Microsoft Windows. 5) Source Code. As with PHP, you can obtain and modify the source code for MySQL. This point is not important to most users most of the time, but it provides you with excellent peace of mind, ensuring future continuity and giving you options in an emergency. In fact, there are now several forks and drop-in replacements for MySQL that you may consider using, including MariaDB, written by the original authors of MySQL, including Michael ‘Monty’ Widenius (https://mariadb.org). 6) Availability of Support. Not all open-source products have a parent company offering support, training, consulting, and certification, but you can get all of these benefits from Oracle (who acquired MySQL with their acquisition of Sun Microsystems, who had previously acquired the founding company, MySQL AB).

1『之前在书籍「2019025Learning_MySQL_and_MariaDB」里看到 MySQL 好像被谁收购了，怕会被限制商用，所以 Michael 开发了 MariaDB。』

What Is New in MySQL (5.x)? At the time of writing, the current version of MySQL was 5.7. Features added to MySQL in the last few releases include.

How Is This Book Organized? This book is divided into five main parts:

Part I,「Using PHP,」provides an overview of the main parts of the PHP language with examples. Each example is a real-world example used in building an e-commerce site rather than「toy」code. We kick off this section with Chapter 1,「PHP Crash Course.」If you’ve already used PHP, you can whiz through this chapter. If you are new to PHP or new to programming, you might want to spend a little more time on it.

Part II,「Using MySQL,」discusses the concepts and design involved in using relational database systems such as MySQL, using SQL, connecting your MySQL database to the world with PHP, and advanced MySQL topics, such as security and optimization.

Part III,「Web Application Security,」covers some of the general issues involved in developing a web application using any language. We then discuss how you can use PHP and MySQL to authenticate your users and securely gather, transmit, and store data.

Part IV,「Advanced PHP Techniques,」offers detailed coverage of some of the major built-in functions in PHP. We have selected groups of functions that are likely to be useful when building a web application. You will learn about interaction with the server, interaction with the network, image generation, date and time manipulation, and session handling.

Part V,「Building Practical PHP and MySQL Projects,」is our favorite section. It deals with practical real-world issues such as managing large projects and debugging, and provides sample projects that demonstrate the power and versatility of PHP and MySQL.

Finally. We hope you enjoy this book and enjoy learning about PHP and MySQL as much as we did when we first began using these products. They are really a pleasure to use. Soon, you’ll be able to join the many thousands of web developers who use these robust, powerful tools to easily build dynamic, real-time web applications.

## 01. PHP Crash Course

This chapter gives you a quick overview of PHP syntax and language constructs. In this book, you’ll learn how to use PHP by working through lots of real-world examples taken from our experiences building real websites. Often, programming textbooks teach basic syntax with very simple examples. We have chosen not to do that. We recognize that what you do is get something up and running, and understand how the language is used, instead of plowing through yet another syntax and function reference that’s no better than the online manual.

Try the examples. Type them in or download them from the website, change them, break them, and learn how to fix them again. This chapter begins with the example of an online product order form to show how  variables, operators, and expressions are used in PHP. It also covers variable types and operator  precedence. You will learn how to access form variables and manipulate them by working out the total and tax on a customer order. You will then develop the online order form example by using a PHP script to validate the input data. You’ll examine the concept of Boolean values and look at examples using if, else, the ?: operator, and the switch statement. Finally, you’ll explore looping by writing some PHP to generate repetitive HTML tables.

### 02. Creating a Sample Application: Bob’s Auto Parts

One of the most common applications of any server-side scripting language is processing HTML forms. You’ll start learning PHP by implementing an order form for Bob’s Auto Parts, a fictional spare parts company. You can find all the code for the examples used in this chapter in the directory called chapter01 on the CD-ROM.

Creating the Order FormBob’s. HTML programmer has set up an order form for the parts that Bob sells. This relatively simple order form, shown in Figure 1.1, is similar to many you have probably seen while surfing. Bob would like to be able to know what his customers ordered, work out the total prices of their orders, and determine how much sales tax is payable on the orders.

Notice that the form’s action is set to the name of the PHP script that will process the customer’s order. (You’ll write this script next.) In general, the value of the action attribute is the URL that will be loaded when the user clicks the Submit button. The data the user has typed in the form will be sent to this URL via the HTTP method specified in the method attribute, either get (appended to the end of the URL) or post (sent as a separate message).

    <form action="processorder.php" method="post">

Also note the names of the form fields: tireqty, oilqty, and sparkqty. You’ll use these names again in the PHP script. Because the names will be reused, it’s important to give your form fields meaningful names that you can easily remember when you begin writing the PHP script. Some HTML editors generate field names like field23 by default. They are difficult to remember. Your life as a PHP programmer will be easier if the names you use reflect the data typed into the field.

You should consider adopting a coding standard for field names so that all field names throughout your site use the same format. This way, you can more easily remember whether, for example, you abbreviated a word in a field name or put in underscores as spaces.

1『form 即表单；get (appended to the end of the URL) or post (sent as a separate message)；』

3『

[\<tr> - HTML（超文本标记语言） | MDN](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)

源码里的 \<tr> 和 \<td> 元素，都是表格元素里的。\<tr> 元素定义表格中的行。 Those can be a mix of \<td> and \<th> elements. \<td> 元素定义了一个包含数据的表格单元格。

』

To process the form, you need to create the script mentioned in the action attribute of the form tag called processorder.php. Open your text editor and create this file. Then type in the following code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bob's Auto Parts - Order Results</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Bob's Auto Parts</h1>
    <h2>Order Results</h2> 
  </body>
</html>
```

Embedding PHP in HTML. Under the \<h2> heading in your file, add the following lines:

    <?php  echo '<p>Order processed.</p>';?>

Save the file and load it in your browser by filling out Bob’s form and clicking the Submit Order button. You should see something similar to the output shown in Figure 1.2. Notice how the PHP code you wrote was embedded inside a normal-looking HTML file. Try viewing the source from your browser. You should see this code \<!DOCTYPE html>

None of the raw PHP is visible because the PHP interpreter has run through the script and replaced it with the output from the script. This means that from PHP you can produce clean HTML viewable with any browser; in other words, the user’s browser does not need to understand PHP. This example illustrates the concept of server-side scripting in a nutshell. The PHP has been interpreted and executed on the web server, as distinct from JavaScript and other client-side technologies interpreted and executed within a web browser on a user’s machine.

3『例子解释了服务端脚本的概念，浏览器不需要理解 PHP 这种服务端脚本，那么联想到，浏览器需要理解 JavaScript 这种客户端脚本。』

The code that you now have in this file consists of four types of text: 1) HTML. 2) PHP tags. 3) PHP statements. 3) Whitespace. You can also add comments. Most of the lines in the example are just plain HTML.

PHP Tags. The PHP code in the preceding example began with \<?php and ended with ?>. This is similar to all HTML tags because they all begin with a less than (\<) symbol and end with a greater than (>) symbol. These symbols (\<?php and ?>) are called PHP tags. They tell the web server where the PHP code starts and finishes. Any text between the tags is interpreted as PHP. Any text outside these tags is treated as normal HTML. The PHP tags allow you to escape from HTML.

There are actually two styles of PHP tags; each of the following fragments of code is equivalent:

 ■ XML style

    <?php echo '<p>Order processed.</p>'; ?>

This is the tag style that we use in this book; it is the preferred PHP tag style. The server administrator cannot turn it off, so you can guarantee it will be available on all servers, which is especially important if you are writing applications that may be used on different installations. This tag style can be used with Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents. In general, we recommend you use this tag style.

 ■ Short style

    <? echo '<p>Order processed.</p>'; ?>

This tag style is the simplest and follows the style of a Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) processing instruction. To use this type of tag — which is the shortest to type — you either need to enable the short_open_tag setting in your conﬁgﬁle or  compile PHP with short tags enabled. You can ﬁnd more information on how to use this tag style in Appendix A. The use of this style is not recommended for use in code you plan to distribute. It will not work in many environments as it is no longer enabled by default.

PHP Statements. You tell the PHP interpreter what to do by including PHP statements between your opening and closing tags. The preceding example used only one type of statement:

    echo '<p>Order processed.</p>';

As you have probably guessed, using the echo construct has a very simple result: It prints (or echoes) the string passed to it to the browser. In Figure 1.2, you can see the result is that the text Order processed. appears in the browser window. Notice that there is a semicolon at the end of the echo statement. Semicolons separate statements in PHP much like periods separate sentences in English. If you have programmed in C or Java before, you will be familiar with using the semicolon in this way. Leaving off the semicolon is a common syntax error that is easily made. However, it’s equally easy to find and to correct.

Whitespace. Spacing characters such as newlines (carriage returns), spaces, and tabs are known as whitespace. As you probably already know, browsers ignore whitespace in HTML, and so does the PHP engine. Consider these two HTML fragments:

    <h1>Welcome to Bob's Auto Parts!</h1><p>What would you like to order today?</p>

and

```
<h1>Welcome             to Bob's
Auto Parts!</h1>
<p>What would you like
to order today?</p>
```

These two snippets of HTML code produce identical output because they appear the same to the browser. However, you can and are encouraged to use whitespace sensibly in your HTML as an aid to humans — to enhance the readability of your HTML code. The same is true for PHP. You don’t need to have any whitespace between PHP statements, but it makes the code much easier to read if you put each statement on a separate line. For example,

    echo 'hello ';
    echo 'world';

and

    echo 'hello ';echo 'world';

are equivalent, but the first version is easier to read.

1『PHP 忽略 whitespace，whitespace 的概念：Spacing characters such as newlines (carriage returns), spaces, and tabs.』

Comments are exactly that: Comments in code act as notes to people reading the code. Comments can be used to explain the purpose of the script, who wrote it, why they wrote it the way they did, when it was last modified, and so on. You generally find comments in all but the simplest PHP scripts. The PHP interpreter ignores any text in comments. Essentially, the PHP parser skips over the comments, making them equivalent to whitespace.

PHP supports C, C++, and shell script–style comments. The following is a C-style, multiline comment that might appear at the start of a PHP script:

```
/* Author: Bob Smith   
Last modified: April 10   
This script processes the customer orders.
*/
```

Multiline comments should begin with a /* and end with */. As in C, multiline comments cannot be nested. You can also use single-line comments, either in the C++ style:

    echo '<p>Order processed.</p>'; // Start printing order

or in the shell script style:

    echo '<p>Order processed.</p>'; # Start printing order

With both of these styles, everything after the comment symbol (# or //) is a comment until you reach the end of the line or the ending PHP tag, whichever comes first. In the following line of code, the text before the closing tag, here is a comment, is part of a comment. The text after the closing tag, here is not, will be treated as HTML because it is outside the closing tag:

    // here is a comment ?> here is not
