## 04. Advanced Features

You have already seen how class type hinting and access control give you more control over a class’s interface. In this chapter, I will delve deeper into PHP’s object-oriented features.

This chapter will cover several subjects: 1) Static methods and properties: Accessing data and functionality through classes rather than objects. 2) Abstract classes and interfaces: Separating design from implementation. 3) Traits: Sharing implementation between class hierarchies. 4) Error handling: Introducing exceptions. 5) Final classes and methods: Limiting inheritance. 6) Destructor methods: Cleaning up after your objects. 7) Interceptor methods: Automating delegation. 8) Cloning objects: Making object copies. 9) Resolving objects to strings: Creating a summary method. 10) Callbacks: Adding functionality to components with anonymous functions and classes.

In this chapter, we came to grips with PHP’s advanced object-oriented features. Some of these will become familiar as you work through the book. In particular, I will return frequently to abstract classes, exceptions, and static methods. In the next chapter, I take a step back from built-in object features and look at classes and functions designed to help you work with objects.
