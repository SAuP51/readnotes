## 0601. Composing Widgets with Vue.js Components

Components are becoming an essential aspect of frontend development, and are a feature in most modern frontend frameworks, including Vue, React, Angular, Polymer, and so on. Components are even becoming native to the web through a new standard called Web Components.

In this chapter, we will use components to create an image carousel for Vuebnb, which allows users to peruse the different photos of a room listing. We'll also refactor Vuebnb to conform to a component-based architecture. Topics covered in this chapter: 1) What components are and how to create them with Vue.js. 2) Component communication through props and events. 3) Single-file components-one of Vue's most useful features. 4) Adding custom content to a component with slots. 5) The benefit of architecting apps entirely from components. 6) How render functions can be used to skip the template compiler. 7) Using the runtime-only build of Vue to lighten the bundle size.

### Summary

In this chapter, we saw how components are used to create reusable custom elements. We then registered our first Vue.js components, defining them with template strings. Next, we looked at component communication with props and custom events. We used this knowledge to build an image carousel within the listing page modal window.

In the second half of the chapter, we got an introduction to single-file components, which we used to refactor Vuebnb into a component-based architecture. We then learned how slots can help us make more versatile components by combining parent and child content. Finally, we saw how the runtime-only build can be used to give a Vue app a smaller size. In the next chapter, we will make Vuebnb a multi-page app by building a home page, and using Vue Router to allow navigation between pages without reloading.
