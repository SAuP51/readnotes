#### 02. 贡献及经历

Richard Eugene Nisbett is an American social psychologist and writer. Nisbett's research interests are in social cognition, culture, social class, and aging. 

Perhaps his most influential publication is "Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes" (with T. D. Wilson, 1977, Psychological Review, 84, 231–259), one of the most often cited psychology articles published, with over 13,000 citations. This article was the first comprehensive, empirically based argument that a variety of mental processes responsible for preferences, choices, and emotions are inaccessible to conscious awareness. Nisbett and Wilson contended that introspective reports can provide only an account of "what people think about how they think," but not "how they really think." Some cognitive psychologists disputed this claim, with Ericsson and Simon (1980) offering an alternative perspective.

Nisbett's book The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently... And Why (Free Press; 2003) contends that "human cognition is not everywhere the same," that Asians and Westerners "have maintained very different systems of thought for thousands of years," and that these differences are scientifically measurable. 

Nisbett's book Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count (2009) argues that environmental factors dominate genetic factors in determining intelligence. The book reviewed extensive favorable attention in the press and from some fellow academics; for example, University of Pennsylvania psychologist Daniel Osherson wrote that the book was a "hugely important analysis of the determinants of IQ". On the other hand, more critical reviewers argued that the book failed to grapple with the strongest evidence for genetic factors in individual and group intelligence differences.

With Edward E. Jones, he named the actor–observer bias, the phenomenon where people acting and people observing use different explanations for why a behavior occurs. This is an important concept in attribution theory, and refers to the tendency to attribute one's own behaviour to situational factors, other people's behaviour to their disposition. Jones and Nisbett's own explanation for this was that our attention is focussed on the situation when we are actors, but on the person when we are observers, although other explanations have been advanced for the actor-observer bias.

The Geography of Thought. Free Press. 2003. ISBN 978-0743216463.《思维版图》

Description:

Everyone knows that while different cultures may think about the world differently, they use the same equipment for doing their thinking. Everyone knows that whatever the skin color, nationality, or religion, every human being uses the same tools for perception, for memory, and for reasoning. Everyone knows that a logically true statement is true in English, German, or Hindi. Everyone knows that when a Chinese and an American look at the same painting, they see the same painting. But what if everyone is wrong? 

When psychologist Richard E. Nisbett showed an animated underwater scene to his American students, they zeroed in on a big fish swimming among smaller fish. Japanese subjects, on the other hand, made observations about the background environment -- and the different "seeings" are a clue to profound underlying cognitive differences between Westerners and East Asians. 

For, as Professor Nisbett shows in The Geography of Thought, people actually think about -- and even see -- the world differently because of differing ecologies, social structures, philosophies, and educational systems that date back to ancient Greece and China and that have survived into the modern world. 

As a result, East Asian thought is "holistic" -- drawn to the perceptual field as a whole and to relations among objects and events within that field. By comparison to Western modes of reasoning, East Asian thought relies far less on categories or on formal logic; it is fundamentally dialectic, seeking a "middle way" between opposing thoughts. By contrast, Westerners focus on salient objects or people, use attributes to assign them to catergories, and apply rules of formal logic to understand their behavior. 

The Geography of Thought documents Professor Nisbett's groundbreaking international research in cultural psychology, a series of comparative studies both persuasive in their rigor and startling in their conclusions, addressing questions such as: 

Why did the ancient Chinese excel at algebra and arithmetic, but not geometry, the brilliant achievement of such Greeks as Euclid? 

Why do East Asians find it so difficult to disentangle an object from its surroundings? 

Why do Western infants learn nouns more rapidly than verbs, when it is the other way around in East Asia? 

What are the implications of these cognitive differences for the future of international politics? 

Do they support a Fukuyamaesque "end of history" scenario or a Huntingtonian "clash of civilizations"? 

From feng shui to metaphysics, from comparative linguistics to economic history, a gulf separates the children of Aristotle from the descendants of Confucius. At a moment in history when the need for cross-cultural understanding and collaboration have never been more important, The Geography of Thought offers both a map to that gulf and a blueprint for a bridge that might be able to span it.

Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count (Norton, 2009)《认知升级》

Description:

A bold refutation of the belief that genes determine intelligence. Who are smarter, Asians or Westerners? Are there genetic explanations for racial differences in test scores? What makes some nationalities excel in engineering and others in music? Will math and science remain a largely male preserve. 

From the damning research of The Bell Curve to the more recent controversy surrounding geneticist James Watson's statements, one factor has been consistently left out of the equation: culture. In the tradition of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould, world-class social psychologist Richard E. Nisbett takes on the idea of intelligence as something that is biologically determined and impervious to culture--with vast implications for the role of education as it relates to social and economic development. 

Intelligence and How to Get It asserts that intellect is not primarily genetic but is principally determined by societal influences. Nisbett's commanding argument, superb marshaling of evidence, and fearless discussions of the controversial carve out new and exciting terrain in this hotly debated field.

Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking (FSG, 2015)《逻辑思维》

Description:

"The most influential thinker, in my life, has been the psychologist Richard Nisbett. He basically gave me my view of the world." -Malcolm Gladwell, New York Times Book Review

Scientific and philosophical concepts can change the way we solve problems by helping us to think more effectively about our behavior and our world. Surprisingly, despite their utility, many of these tools remain unknown to most of us.

In Mindware, the world-renowned psychologist Richard E. Nisbett presents these ideas in clear and accessible detail. Nisbett has made a distinguished career of studying and teaching such powerful problem-solving concepts as the law of large numbers, statistical regression, cost-benefit analysis, sunk costs and opportunity costs, and causation and correlation, probing the best methods for teaching others how to use them effectively in their daily lives. 

In this groundbreaking book, Nisbett shows us how to frame common problems in such a way that these scientific and statistical principles can be applied to them. The result is an enlightening and practical guide to the most essential tools of reasoning ever developed-tools that can easily be used to make better professional, business, and personal decisions.

## 20191002. 术语卡——卡片大法
> 摘自公号008开智学堂「20190922极简四步走快速掌握卡片大法.md」

术语卡：阅读中出现过的学术术语或者作者特定黑话；人名卡：阅读中出现过的人名，以及他的个人简介如何；反常识卡：阅读此章，有什么理论模型/推断证据/故事/行动，挑战了你的既有常识；金句卡：收集性感的句子；行动卡：写下你可以执行的行动；技巧卡：积累你学到的技巧；任意卡：此处自行发挥；其中，最重要的是术语卡，人名卡以及反常识卡，保持最小输出。

术语：双盲实验。

印象：双盲是科学方法的一种，目的是避免研究结果受安慰剂效应或观察者偏向所影响。在各种科学研究领域中，从医学、食品、心理到社会科学及法证都有使用双盲方法进行实验。

例子：警察可能会对证人作出有意或无意的影响，因此警察局内的认人手续是一个对证人记忆的单盲测试。现在的执法机构倾向在认人过程中使用双盲测试，负责认人过程的警员事先不能知道被认的人当中谁是嫌疑犯，以免影响证人。比如我喜欢的电影「某某某」中提到了。

出处：双盲 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书。

注意点：印象是指对术语的定义、解释，例子是支撑你这种印象的证据、例子或原始引文；尽量用「自己的话」而非直接照搬来撰写印象、例子，以加深理解或便于记忆；尽量寻找一手出处，或参考维基百科而非国内的百科。

人名：道金斯（Clinton Richard Dawkins，1941年3月26日－）。

印象：著名科普作家。

例子：1976 年出版名著《自私的基因》，引起了广泛关注。在书中他阐述了以基因为核心的进化论思想，将一切生物类比为基因的生存机器，并引入了「模因」这一概念。后来又出版了《延伸的表现型》、《盲眼钟表匠》、《上帝错觉》等书，宣扬演化论，反对神创论。被称之为「新无神论的四骑士」之一。

出处：理查德·道金斯 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书。

注意点：人名尽量写上英文，便于查找；人物所在的时代很重要，能够帮你厘清很多线索，因此务必查找人物的生日；印象写你对该人印象最深刻的一点，比如他最突出的成就。

常识：伟大的创新往往依赖多数人的判定！

反常识：伟大的创新竟然依赖少数人的判定！

发现者：Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

发现记录：

- 原文：从专业化的角度来看，学界存在着巨大的差异。对于一些领域来说，学界的广度类似于社会的广度。美国的全部人口决定了可口可乐的新配方是否是一个值得保持的创新。在另一方面，据说世界上最初只有四五个人理解爱因斯坦的相对论，但他们意见的分量足以使爱因斯坦的名字变得家喻户晓。不过，即使在这种情况下，更广泛的团体在决定爱因斯坦的成果是否配得上文化的中心位置方面也具有发言权。

例子：程乐华老师发明了心理套娃，在心理咨询界获得认同，他的著作《心理套娃》受心理咨询师的欢迎，却不是畅销书。对于学习可供性的新手来说，这本书却是入门宝典。

启示：与其追求大部分人的认同，不如追求小部分人的肯定。

注意点：书名，加上出版年份，页码；出处：撰写原始出处；例子：支撑该反常识成立的例子；启发：附上它给自己带来的行动启发。

在撰写这些卡片时，你需要格外注意：

时间线索：比如撰写「人名卡」，你需要注意他哪个时代出生的人物，又如撰写「术语卡」，你需要注意这个理论诞生的时间。一旦你意识到多元智能理论是上个世纪八十年代初出现，认知神经科学是上个八九十年代诞生的。基于学科产生的时间，你就不会盲目地去推崇多元智能了。它毕竟是在认知神经科学诞生之前的假设。

信息源头：你需要找到最原始的论文或者资料，知道是谁第一个提出这个术语，比如「元认知」、「自主心智」、「心智程序」等是谁提出来的，一旦养成这种习惯，就会增强你的独立思考能力。

反常识证据：每个时代的「常识」都是帮助人类降低认知负荷，提高社会运转效率，但是恰恰是这些「常识」也妨碍了你的认知。因此，你需要时不时借助鲜活证据来拓展认知边界。假设你是一名古人，你能明白如何通过当时的一些实验证据来证明地球是圆的，那么你就是一个时代的杰出英才。
