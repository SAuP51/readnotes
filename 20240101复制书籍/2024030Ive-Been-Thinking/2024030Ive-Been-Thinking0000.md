## Prologue: Lucky Dan

I've been lucky all my life, it almost makes me believe in the stars.

— Tom Stoppard, 1986, in a letter to his mother

I've never thought of myself as lucky, I'm a coward. That's why I can't be a gambler. But I work very hard. The harder I work, the luckier I get!

— Alex Bird (famed British "punter," or gambler), Sunday Observer (London), April 24, 1983

O N O CTOBER 24, 2006, I WAS RUSHED BY AMBULANCE from my office at Tufts University to the emergency room at Lahey Clinic, where doctors discovered the problem: the inner and outer layers of my aorta had come apart—an aortic dissection —and I could die at any moment if the blood from my heart burst out into my chest cavity. The day before I had been in Mackerel Cove on Swan's Island in Maine on my sailboat, Xanthippe . This was the last cruise of the season, joined by my Swedish friend Bo Dahlbom and his son Fredrik, and as I slowly pulled on the heavy anchor line I felt a slight pain in my chest, reminding me of the pain I had felt seven years earlier when I'd had a "silent heart attack" that had led to a triple-bypass operation. We sailed back to Blue Hill in a stiff headwind, moored the boat, took off the heavy sails, put the inflatable dinghy on the roof of my car, and went back to the farm, before I made a quick trip to the local hospital, where I was told I had not had a heart attack but should see my cardiologist as soon as I could. The next day we drove to Tufts, where I asked the department secretary if she had any Tylenol, and she wisely called the ambulance instead.

One of the little-known side effects of open-heart surgery is ministrokes caused by debris from the operation clogging up the capillaries in the brain, and my cardiologist explicitly warned the surgical team that since my mind was my life, they should strive to avoid turning me into a "pumphead"—the ugly term heart surgeons use in private for those whose brains are damaged by the heart-lung machine. After the operation, before they removed me from the machine, they reversed the flow of blood to my brain , sending it into the veins and out of the arteries, hoping to flush out any debris that was about to disable my res cogitans , my thinking thing (my brain, not, as Descartes would have it, a distinct and immaterial substance). So I've been brainwashed, quite literally. Did it work? As soon as I could sit up in my hospital bed after the operation I got out my trusty laptop and wrote a short piece to see if I still had my marbles. It was put on Edge.org, where it attracted a lot of attention. What do you think?

Thank Goodness! (November 2, 2006)

There are no atheists in foxholes, according to an old but dubious saying, and there is at least a little anecdotal evidence in favor of it in the notorious cases of famous atheists who have emerged from near-death experiences to announce to the world that they have changed their minds. The British philosopher Sir A. J. Ayer, who died in 1989, is a fairly recent example. Here is another anecdote to ponder.

Two weeks ago, I was rushed by ambulance to a hospital where it was determined by c-t scan that I had a "dissection of the aorta"—the lining of the main output vessel carrying blood from my heart had been torn up, creating a two-channel pipe where there should only be one. Fortunately for me, the fact that I'd had a coronary artery bypass graft seven years ago probably saved my life, since the tangle of scar tissue that had grown like ivy around my heart in the intervening years reinforced the aorta, preventing catastrophic leakage from the tear in the aorta itself. After a nine-hour surgery, in which my heart was stopped entirely and my body and brain were chilled down to about 45 degrees to prevent brain damage from lack of oxygen until they could get the heart-lung machine pumping, I am now the proud possessor of a new aorta up to the aortic arch, made of strong Dacron fabric tubing sewn into shape on the spot by the surgeon, attached to my heart along with a carbon-fiber valve that makes a reassuring little click every time my heart beats.

As I now enter a gentle period of recuperation, I have much to reflect on, about the harrowing experience itself and even more about the flood of supporting messages I've received since word got out about my latest adventure. Friends were anxious to learn if I had had a near-death experience, and if so, what effect it had had on my longstanding public atheism. Had I had an epiphany? Was I going to follow in the footsteps of Ayer (who recovered his aplomb and insisted a few days later "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief"), or was my atheism still intact and unchanged?

Yes, I did have an epiphany. I saw with greater clarity than ever before in my life that when I say "Thank goodness!" this is not merely a euphemism for "Thank God!" (We atheists don't believe that there is any God to thank.) I really do mean thank goodness! There is a lot of goodness in this world, and more goodness every day, and this fantastic human-made fabric of excellence is genuinely responsible for the fact that I am alive today. It is a worthy recipient of the gratitude I feel today, and I want to celebrate that fact here and now.

To whom, then, do I owe a debt of gratitude? To the cardiologist who has kept me alive and ticking for years, and who swiftly and confidently rejected the original diagnosis of nothing worse than pneumonia. To the surgeons, neurologists, anesthesiologists, and the perfusionist, who kept my systems going for many hours under daunting circumstances. To the dozen or so physician assistants, and to nurses and physical therapists and x-ray technicians and a small army of phlebotomists so deft that you hardly know they are drawing your blood, and the people who brought the meals, kept my room clean, did the mountains of laundry generated by such a messy case, wheel-chaired me to x-ray, and so forth. These people came from Uganda, Kenya, Liberia, Haiti, the Philippines, Croatia, Russia, China, Korea, India—and the United States, of course—and I have never seen more impressive mutual respect, as they helped each other out and checked each other's work. But for all their teamwork, this local gang could not have done their jobs without the huge background of contributions from others. I remember with gratitude my late friend and Tufts colleague, physicist Allan Cormack, who shared the Nobel Prize for his invention of the c-t scanner. Allan—you have posthumously saved yet another life, but who's counting? The world is better for the work you did. Thank goodness. Then there is the whole system of medicine, both the science and the technology, without which the best-intentioned efforts of individuals would be roughly useless. So I am grateful to the editorial boards and referees, past and present, of Science , Nature , Journal of the American Medical Association , Lancet , and all the other institutions of science and medicine that keep churning out improvements, detecting and correcting flaws.

Do I worship modern medicine? Is science my religion? Not at all; there is no aspect of modern medicine or science that I would exempt from the most rigorous scrutiny, and I can readily identify a host of serious problems that still need to be fixed. That's easy to do, of course, because the worlds of medicine and science are already engaged in the most obsessive, intensive, and humble self-assessments yet known to human institutions, and they regularly make public the results of their self-examinations. Moreover, this open-ended rational criticism, imperfect as it is, is the secret of the astounding success of these human enterprises. There are measurable improvements every day. Had I had my blasted aorta a decade ago, there would have been no prayer of saving me. It's hardly routine today, but the odds of my survival were actually not so bad (these days, roughly 33 percent of aortic dissection patients die in the first twenty-four hours after onset without treatment, and the odds get worse by the hour thereafter).

One thing in particular struck me when I compared the medical world on which my life now depended with the religious institutions I have been studying so intensively in recent years. One of the gentler, more supportive themes to be found in every religion (so far as I know) is the idea that what really matters is what is in your heart: if you have good intentions, and are trying to do what (God says) is right, that is all anyone can ask. Not so in medicine! If you are wrong—especially if you should have known better—your good intentions count for almost nothing. And whereas taking a leap of faith and acting without further scrutiny of one's options is often celebrated by religions, it is considered a grave sin in medicine. A doctor whose devout faith in his personal revelations about how to treat aortic aneurysm led him to engage in untested trials with human patients would be severely reprimanded if not driven out of medicine altogether. There are exceptions, of course. A few swashbuckling, risk-taking pioneers are tolerated and (if they prove to be right) eventually honored, but they can exist only as rare exceptions to the ideal of the methodical investigator who scrupulously rules out alternative theories before putting his own into practice. Good intentions and inspiration are simply not enough.

In other words, whereas religions may serve a benign purpose by letting many people feel comfortable with the level of morality they themselves can attain, no religion holds its members to the high standards of moral responsibility that the secular world of science and medicine does! And I'm not just talking about the standards "at the top"—among the surgeons and doctors who make life or death decisions every day. I'm talking about the standards of conscientiousness endorsed by the lab technicians and meal preparers, too. This tradition puts its faith in the unlimited application of reason and empirical inquiry, checking and re-checking, and getting in the habit of asking "What if I'm wrong?" Appeals to faith or membership are never tolerated. Imagine the reception a scientist would get if he tried to suggest that others couldn't replicate his results because they just didn't share the faith of the people in his lab! And, to return to my main point, it is the goodness of this tradition of reason and open inquiry that I thank for my being alive today.

What, though, do I say to those of my religious friends (and yes, I have quite a few religious friends) who have had the courage and honesty to tell me that they have been praying for me? I have gladly forgiven them, for there are few circumstances more frustrating than not being able to help a loved one in any more direct way. I confess to regretting that I could not pray (sincerely) for my friends and family in time of need, so I appreciate the urge, however clearly I recognize its futility. I translate my religious friends' remarks readily enough into one version or another of what my fellow brights [an attempt by me and others to popularize a new term for unbelievers; see chapter 27 ] have been telling me: "I've been thinking about you, and wishing with all my heart [another ineffective but irresistible self-indulgence] that you come through this OK." The fact that these dear friends have been thinking of me in this way, and have taken an effort to let me know, is in itself, without any need for a supernatural supplement, a wonderful tonic. These messages from my family and from friends around the world have been literally heart-warming in my case, and I am grateful for the boost in morale (to truly manic heights, I fear!) that it has produced in me. But I am not joking when I say that I have had to forgive my friends who said that they were pray ing for me. I have resisted the temptation to respond "Thanks, I appreciate it, but did you also sacrifice a goat?" I feel about this the same way I would feel if one of them said "I just paid a voodoo doctor to cast a spell for your health." What a gullible waste of money that could have been spent on more important projects! Don't expect me to be grateful, or even indifferent. I do appreciate the affection and generosity of spirit that motivated you, but wish you had found a more reasonable way of expressing it.

But isn't this awfully harsh? Surely it does the world no harm if those who can honestly do so pray for me! No, I'm not at all sure about that. For one thing, if they really wanted to do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about. For another, we now have quite solid grounds (e.g., the recently released Benson study at Harvard) for believing that intercessory prayer simply doesn't work. Anybody whose practice shrugs off that research is subtly undermining respect for the very goodness I am thanking. If you insist on keeping the myth of the effectiveness of prayer alive, you owe the rest of us a justification in the face of the evidence. Pending such a justification, I will excuse you for indulging in your tradition; I know how comforting tradition can be. But I want you to recognize that what you are doing is morally problematic at best. If you would even consider filing a malpractice suit against a doctor who made a mistake in treating you, or suing a pharmaceutical company that didn't conduct all the proper control tests before selling you a drug that harmed you, you must acknowledge your tacit appreciation of the high standards of rational inquiry to which the medical world holds itself, and yet you continue to indulge in a practice for which there is no known rational justification at all, and take yourself to be actually making a contribution. (Try to imagine your outrage if a pharmaceutical company responded to your suit by blithely replying "But we prayed good and hard for the success of the drug! What more do you want?")

The best thing about saying thank goodness in place of thank God is that there really are lots of ways of repaying your debt to goodness—by setting out to create more of it, for the benefit of those to come. Goodness comes in many forms, not just medicine and science. Thank goodness for the music of, say, Randy Newman, which could not exist without all those wonderful pianos and recording studios, to say nothing of the musical contributions of every great composer from Bach through Wagner to Scott Joplin and the Beatles. Thank goodness for fresh drinking water in the tap, and food on our table. Thank goodness for fair elections and truthful journalism. If you want to express your gratitude to goodness, you can plant a tree, feed an orphan, buy books for schoolgirls in the Islamic world, or contribute in thousands of other ways to the manifest improvement of life on this planet now and in the near future.

Or you can thank God—but the very idea of repaying God is ludicrous. What could an omniscient, omnipotent Being (the Man Who Has Everything?) do with any paltry repayments from you? (And besides, according to the Christian tradition God has already redeemed the debt for all time, by sacrificing his own son. Try to repay that loan!) Yes, I know, those themes are not to be understood literally; they are symbolic. I grant it, but then the idea that by thanking God you are actually doing some good has got to be understood to be just symbolic, too. I prefer real good to symbolic good.

Still, I excuse those who pray for me. I see them as like tenacious scientists who resist the evidence for theories they don't like long after a graceful concession would have been the appropriate response. I applaud you for your loyalty to your own position—but remember: loyalty to tradition is not enough. You've got to keep asking yourself: What if I'm wrong? In the long run, I think religious people can be asked to live up to the same moral standards as secular people in science and medicine.

I've published seven books and dozens of articles in the sixteen years since that operation, and packed a lifetime of adventures around the world into that supplement of time granted by the goodness of those around me. How lucky can anybody get?

I once participated in a weekend gathering in Seattle of very smart high school kids, designed to inspire them to great achievements. There was an all-star cast, with several Nobel laureates, the novelist Amy Tan, the Google boys Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the glass sculptor Dale Chihuly, and other notables. What struck me about the fifteen-minute talks each of us gave to these attentive youngsters was that most of us focused on the role of luck: we had just happened to be in the right place at the right time, found the right mentors, made a few lucky stabs in the dark. This intense modesty was meant to put them at ease, but wouldn't it have an unintended side effect? "Don't think there's a reliable path to greatness. Just wing it, and if you're lucky you'll end up like us!" Were we just a convention of lottery winners telling others that there was no secret to our success?

I recently received an email from Peter Godfrey-Smith, the great philosopher/scuba diver/octopus researcher:

Hi Dan,

I am reading a stack of Mike Levin's work [my Tufts colleague with whom I had recently coauthored a paper].

How is it that you always pick up the ultra-interesting stuff so quickly??

Been doing it for a lot of decades.

Best wishes, Peter

As it happens, I'd just been mulling over a version of the same question while composing this memoir. Luck, of course, does play a big role, especially at the outset, when part of the luck includes hitting on a good way to parlay the early luck into more luck—the rich get richer, as one says. Peter's question—luckily for me—suggested an answer I've only recently come to appreciate fully: he doesn't ask how I came up with the ultra-interesting stuff; he asks how I picked it up so quickly. I'm a pack rat, a magpie, always on the lookout for a useful tidbit. "This might come in handy someday," I think, as I add a discarded gear or connecting rod or other piece of machinery to my ever-expanding collection of thingamabobs, gadgets, and tools in my home workshop. My thinking machine—my brain—is similarly provisioned with lots of useful stuff I've picked up. I presented a gallery of over six dozen of my favorites in Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking (2013). I love to fix things with whatever might serve, and for all these decades, I've always wanted to know how "the magic" works. I like to quote a passage in Lee Siegel's excellent book on Indian street magic, Net of Magic: Wonders and Deceptions in India (1991):

"I'm writing a book on magic," I explain, and I'm asked, "Real magic?" By real magic people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers. "No," I answer: "Conjuring tricks, not real magic." Real magic, in other words, refers to the magic that is not real, while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic. (p. 425)

Many people are eager to protect "real magic" in one way or another, and many of them find philosophy to be the ideal profession for this campaign. I'd say it is the distinguishing characteristic of one kind of philosopher. But then there are the antiphilosophers, who look at the mess made by the others and say to themselves, "Fie! I'm going to try to clear this all up!" My guides and heroes have been the folks—scientists and philosophers—who have hunches about how the tricks are done, how the illusions are generated. They are not just skeptics and debunkers but constructive explainers, groping for models or theories to replace the armchair verities of the philosophers with testable ideas.

Way back in my dissertation in 1965 I saw that the best—the only—way of making sense of the mind and consciousness is through evolution by natural selection on many levels, and I began sketching an open-ended framework for how that might run. And I kept philosophical phisticuffs in the background. My approach struck a chord in researchers in several different disciplines. They got it in one way or another and saw how they could add a few pieces to my emerging picture and fix a few flaws in their own work. They invited me to be a friendly interlocutor. I didn't have to go to them, philosopher's hat in hand, and ask if I could kibitz; they sought me out.

I somehow managed to create (or, more accurately, preside over the emergence of) an intellectual magnet that just kept bringing supersmart people into my orbit . I got used to being surrounded by people who knew a whole lot more than I did, and I was always happy to be tutored, especially when I disagreed with them. Some of my favorite arguments and examples have been forged in heated disputes with thinkers whose positions I largely reject, for reasons I now understand better than when I first confronted them. The physicist Wolfgang Pauli famously dismissed another physicist's ideas as "not even wrong," and I have opportunistically tried to fix some of the wrong ideas presented by physicist Roger Penrose, linguist Noam Chomsky, neuroscientist Christof Koch, and evolutionary biologists Stephen Jay Gould and David Sloan Wilson, among others. Then there were my long-standing battles with my fellow philosophers Thomas Nagel, Jerry Fodor, John Searle, and David Chalmers. Where would I be without all these brilliant mistakes to correct, with the help of my thinking tools? (For instance, I harnessed John Horton Conway's delicious Game of Life to find a middle ground between Fodor's unappealing "industrial-strength realism" and the equally unpersuasive "eliminativism" of Paul Churchland, in "Real Patterns" [1991], one of my most influential papers.) I won't have room to dwell on all the important details, but the endnotes provide links for those who want to check out my repairs and decide for themselves.

I have (so far) led a remarkably adventurous and fulfilling life, way beyond the most extravagant fantasies of my youth—and I was a cocksure young man with vaulting ambition. How did it happen? Was it all just luck, or "connections," or may I claim some credit for getting myself into my current happy state? Do I in any sense deserve the benefits I now enjoy?

I believe in free will, in a nonmagical sense that really matters. I think those who do good in the world deserve praise and rewards and those who do evil deserve to be punished, if they are competent self-controlling adults. I also believe that this kind of free will is not threatened by determinism, and have devoted three books and dozens of articles to defending this initially counterintuitive claim. Determinism is the claim that "there is at any instant exactly one possible future ," but this does not imply inevitability . We, and other autonomous agents, avoid things every day. Determinism doesn't "tie your hands," nor does it prevent you from making and then reconsidering decisions, turning over a new leaf, learning from your mistakes. Determinism is not a puppeteer controlling you. If you're a normal adult, you have enough self-control to maintain your autonomy, and hence responsibility, in a world full of seductions and distractions. But even if I'm right that determinism is no threat to responsibility or autonomy, this wouldn't settle the question of whether or not I'm just a preternaturally lucky person who has made the most of the good fortune that has been my lot.

Actually, I haven't made the most of it. Somebody with a stronger character could have done much more. I have a lazy streak, I'm an undisciplined reader who is easily distracted, and I have an insatiable appetite for time wasters such as the comics in the newspaper, crossword puzzles, Scrabble (and better: Frigate Bird, an intense game played with Scrabble tiles but no board), sudoku, and Rubik's Cube. A brilliant childhood friend of mine became so addicted to playing bridge that he flunked out of college, and I could have done the same had I found a good partner at just the wrong time. I almost made the mistake at Harvard of not signing up for a course that would inter fere with my late-morning game of pool at the Hasty Pudding Club! What was I thinking?

When I reflect on my narrow escapes from dissolution, I credit that very reflectiveness, which has often saved me in the nick of time. That and my willingness, when confronting a difficult moral decision, to ask—and take —the advice of friends, chief among them Susan, my wife of sixty years.

There are lessons to be learned from how I handled my own education and how I became such a good thinker . (The philosopher Don Ross once said of me, "Dan believes modesty is a virtue to be reserved for special occasions.") I wouldn't be writing this book if I didn't think I had something I could usefully impart to readers—the secrets of my success, my good tricks and policies, my ways of dealing with people and problems. There are many philosophers who are more clever, much better scholars, quicker in argument, vastly better at the technical moves philosophers make than I am. They will tell you so, and I will agree with them. But as Gilbert Ryle, my thesis supervisor at Oxford, told a colleague of mine over a few beers in Salzburg back in the '60s, "There are much cleverer chaps than Dennett, but he has a fire in his belly." I've gratefully leaned on that crutch now for more than half a century.

As you can see, I am not modest, but I am not overconfident either, like some thinkers I know. John Searle, one of my most aggressive critics, is actually a lot like me: sure of himself, impatient with nitpicking philosophers, willing to brand respected trains of thought as nonsense. When he encounters a philosophical argument or position that is difficult for him to comprehend, he rephrases it in his own terms—in terms that he understands. That's just what I do too. But when Searle's digest of the difficult idea strikes him as absurd, he thereupon says so, vehemently. I don't. I reserve judgment. I reflect: these people defending this view don't seem to be fools; maybe I've misconstrued them. I go back to their work to see if I can find a better version of their view. Sometimes I can't, and then I can be as tough a critic as Searle. But sometimes—in fact, usually—I can find a better version of the challenging idea, and then I've learned something. Searle's world is full of philosophical nincompoops; mine is full of philosophers who are learned, intelligent, hard-working but often self-defeating presenters of their best ideas. Why would anybody want to be a philosopher if philosophers in general were as stupid as Searle seems to think? (Sir Karl Popper is another philosopher whose low opinion of those who disagreed with him has made me wonder how he could stand being a philosopher.)

I wasn't always as confident as I am today about the topics I work on. In fact, I had long, scary periods when I wondered if I was cut out for this work at all and seriously considered abandoning philosophy and pursuing sculpture as more than a hobby. I'll say more about those doldrums later. Now, before I turn to the tale of my progress through academia, I want to make two generalizations about philosophers: Anybody who becomes a philosopher and never has any serious doubts about whether this is a wise life choice is not a very good philosopher. Anybody who never doubts their own abilities as a philosopher is not a very good philosopher. Yes, there are dozens, hundreds, of "distinguished" philosophers who show no signs (to me) of having harbored these insecurities, but I think their work is in general superficial and meretricious—dazzling footwork on issues of no real importance. I call it working out "the higher-order truths of chmess." "Chmess" is my name for a variation on chess in which the king can move two squares in any direction. It's probably never been played or ever been worth playing, and it's not worth finding out. Proving truths about chmess is no doubt as challenging as proving truths about chess, but much less important. Nobody cares or should care. The neuropsychologist Donald Hebb once observed, "If it's not worth doing, it's not worth doing well." Many dusty corners of academia—not just philosophy—would be depopulated if Hebb's rule were applied vigorously, but I strongly support the idea that nobody is qualified to judge which intellectual pursuits are not worth tolerating and even funding, so it is best to acknowledge that academia is in some measure a strikingly luxurious enterprise, keeping alive thousands of projects that will never "pay for themselves" in any recognizable way. We mustn't allow academia to become just another training ground for whatever workers seem to be required in the near future. Let a thousand flowers bloom, but remember that most of them will wilt or die.

序章：幸运的丹

我的一生似乎总是好运相伴，这几乎让我相信了命运的安排。

—— 汤姆·斯托帕德，1986 年，在给母亲的信中写道我从不认为自己是个幸运儿，我是个胆小鬼。这就是为什么我无法成为一名赌徒。但我非常勤奋。我越努力，似乎幸运就越眷顾我！

—— 亚历克斯·伯德（著名的英国赌徒），《星期日观察家报》（伦敦），1983 年 4 月 24 日

2006 年 10 月 24 日，我因突发状况被紧急送往拉伊诊所的急诊室。医生诊断出我的主动脉发生了严重的病变：主动脉夹层。这是一种危及生命的状况，主动脉的内层和外层分离，一旦心脏的血液冲破这层薄弱的屏障，涌入胸腔，我随时可能丧命。

就在前一天，我还在缅因州斯旺岛的鲭鱼湾，与我的瑞典朋友 Bo Dahlbom 和他的儿子 Fredrik 一起，驾驶着我的帆船 Xanthippe 进行本季的最后一次巡航。在拉动沉重的锚线时，我突然感到胸口一阵疼痛，这让我回想起七年前的那次「无声心脏病发作」。那次发作后，我不得不接受了三重搭桥手术。

尽管疼痛，我们还是顶着逆风航行回到了蓝山，安全停泊了帆船，卸下了沉重的帆，将充气艇安置在我的车顶上，然后返回了农场。我尽快去了当地医院，医生告诉我并没有再次心脏病发作，但建议我尽快咨询我的心脏病专家。

第二天，我们驱车前往塔夫茨大学。在那里，我向系秘书询问是否有泰诺止痛药，她意识到情况可能不妙，果断地叫来了救护车。

在心脏手术中，一个鲜为人知的副作用是微小中风，这是由于手术过程中产生的碎片堵塞了大脑中的微小血管所导致的。我的心脏病专家特别提醒手术团队，因为我的思维能力对我至关重要，他们应该尽量避免让我变成一个「泵头」—— 这是心脏外科医生私下里对那些因心肺机而脑部受损的人的俗称。手术后，在他们将我移除心肺机之前，他们采取了措施，逆转了我大脑中的血液流向，使其从静脉流出而不是动脉，希望这样能够清除任何可能损害我的「思考之物」（即我的大脑，而不是笛卡尔所认为的独立非物质实体）的碎片。所以，我经历了一次非常字面意义上的「洗脑」过程。这个方法有效吗？手术后，我一能坐起来，就拿出我的笔记本电脑，写了一篇短文，看看我是否还保持着我的思维能力。这篇文章被放在了 Edge.org 上，引起了很大的关注。你怎么看？

谢天谢地！（2006 年 11 月 2 日）

根据一个古老但可疑的说法，战壕里的士兵在面对死亡威胁时往往会寻求宗教的慰藉，因此没有无神论者。在一些著名的案例中，有证据表明，一些原本坚定的无神论者在经历了濒死体验后改变了他们的信仰。1989 年去世的英国哲学家 A.J. 艾耶尔爵士就是一个例子。这里还有一个值得深思的轶事。

两周前，我因突发状况被紧急送往医院。经过 CT 扫描，医生发现我的主动脉 —— 连接心脏的主要血管 —— 发生了严重的撕裂，形成了不应该存在的双层结构。幸运的是，七年前我做过一次心脏搭桥手术，手术后形成的疤痕组织加强了主动脉，避免了撕裂导致的致命泄漏。经过长达九小时的手术，我的心脏被暂时停止，身体和大脑被冷却以保护脑部不受缺氧伤害，直到心肺机接管血液循环。手术后，我拥有了一条由坚固的 Dacron 材料制成的新主动脉，以及一个每次心跳都会发出轻微响声的碳纤维心脏瓣膜。

现在我正处于恢复期，我有时间去思考这次惊险的经历，以及我收到的众多支持信息。朋友们好奇我是否经历了濒死体验，以及这是否影响了我的无神论观点。我是否有了宗教上的觉悟？我会像哲学家艾尔那样，在经历濒死体验后仍然坚持自己的无神论立场吗？我的无神论是否依然坚定不移？

是的，我经历了一次顿悟。我比以往任何时候都更加清晰地认识到，当我喊出「感谢上天！」时，这并不只是对「感谢上帝！」的委婉替代（我们无神论者并不认为有上帝可以感谢）。我真正想要表达的是对这个世界上的美好表示感激！这个世界充满了美好，而且每天都在增添新的美好，这些由人类创造的卓越成就正是我今天能够活着的原因。它们值得我今天所感受到的深深感激，我想要在这里和现在庆祝这一事实。

那么，我应该向谁表达我的感激之情呢？我要感谢那位心脏病专家，多年来他一直守护着我的生命，迅速而坚定地推翻了最初仅是肺炎的误诊。感谢那些在极端困难的情况下，让我的生命维持系统持续运作数小时的手术医生、神经科医生、麻醉师和体外循环师。感谢那些医师助理、护士、物理治疗师、X 光技师，以及那些抽血技术高超到几乎让你感觉不到疼痛的采血师，还有那些送餐、打扫房间、处理大量洗衣、用轮椅推我去 X 光室等的工作人员。这些人来自世界各地，包括乌干达、肯尼亚、利比里亚、海地、菲律宾、克罗地亚、俄罗斯、中国、韩国、印度，当然还有美国。我从未见过如此令人钦佩的相互尊重，他们互相协助，互相检查工作。然而，如果没有来自其他人的巨大贡献，这个本地团队也无法完成他们的工作。我怀着深深的感激回忆起我已故的朋友和塔夫茨大学的同事，物理学家艾伦·科马克，他与他人共同获得了诺贝尔奖，因为他发明了 CT 扫描仪。艾伦 —— 你的发明再次拯救了生命，这已经无法用数字来衡量。你的工作让世界变得更加美好。感谢这一切。此外，我还要感谢整个医学体系，包括科学和技术，没有这些，个人的最好意图也将无济于事。因此，我感谢《科学》、《自然》、《美国医学会杂志》、《柳叶刀》以及其他所有科学和医学机构的编辑委员会和审稿人，过去和现在，他们不断推动医学进步，发现并纠正错误。

我并不盲目崇拜现代医学，科学也不是我的信仰。我对现代医学和科学的每一个领域都持批判态度，并且我能够指出许多亟待解决的重大问题。这并不难，因为医学和科学界正在进行前所未有的深入、细致和谦逊的自我审视，并且他们公开分享自我评估的结果。正是这种持续的、尽管不完美的理性批评，成为了这些人类事业取得惊人成就的关键。每天都有实质性的进步，如果我在十年前遭遇了主动脉破裂，我几乎没有生还的可能。如今，虽然这仍不是常规治疗，但我的生存几率已经大大提高（目前，大约 33% 的主动脉夹层患者在发病后 24 小时内未经治疗死亡，而且随着时间的推移，死亡率会逐渐上升。）

当我比较我生命所依赖的医疗领域与我近年来深入研究的宗教机构时，我注意到了一个显著的差异。在各种宗教中，一个普遍且温和的主题是，真正重要的是内心的善意：如果你怀有良好的意愿，并努力遵循（上帝的教导）去做正确的事情，这就足够了。然而，在医学领域，情况并非如此。如果你犯了错误 —— 尤其是如果你本应知道得更好 —— 你的良好意愿几乎没有任何分量。在宗教中，人们常常赞扬那些基于信仰而采取行动、不加审视就做出选择的行为，但在医学中，这种行为被视为严重的过失。例如，如果一位医生因为坚信自己对治疗主动脉瘤的独特见解，而在患者身上进行未经证实的试验，他可能会受到严厉的批评，甚至被逐出医学界。当然，也有例外。一些敢于冒险的先驱者被容忍，如果他们最终证明自己是正确的，甚至会受到尊敬。然而，这些先驱者只是例外，医学界的理想是那些严谨的研究者，他们在将自己的理论应用于实践之前，会严格排除其他可能性。在医学中，仅仅有良好的意愿和灵感是远远不够的。

换言之，虽然宗教可能通过让许多人对自己能够达到的道德水平感到满意而发挥着积极作用，但没有任何宗教能够像科学和医学领域那样，对其成员施加如此高的道德责任标准！这不仅包括那些每天都在做生死决策的顶尖医生和外科医生，还包括那些实验室技术人员和餐食准备者所秉持的尽职尽责的标准。这一传统坚信理性和经验探究的无限应用，不断进行检查和复核，并习惯性地问自己「如果我错了怎么办？」在科学领域，基于信仰或成员资格的论点是不被接受的。试想，如果一个科学家声称他人无法复制他的实验结果，是因为他们缺乏他实验室成员的信仰，这样的言论会遭到怎样的反应！归根结底，正是这种理性和开放探究的传统，让我感激今天我还能活着。

对于那些勇敢而诚实地告诉我他们一直在为我祈祷的宗教朋友们，我该如何回应呢？（是的，我有很多宗教朋友。）我理解并原谅了他们，因为没有什么比无法以更直接的方式帮助所爱之人更令人沮丧的了。我承认，我遗憾自己不能在朋友和家人需要时真诚地为他们祈祷，所以我理解这种冲动，尽管我清楚地认识到它的无效性。我很容易将我的宗教朋友的话翻译成我那些「明理人」（我和其他人试图推广的一个新词，用来指代不信教者；见第 27 章）对我说的话的一种版本：「我一直在想你，全心全意地希望你能平安度过。」这些亲爱的朋友以这种方式想到我，并努力让我知道，这本身就是一种美妙的慰藉，无需任何超自然的补充。来自世界各地家人和朋友的信息对我来说确实是暖心之举，我感谢它给我的士气带来的提升（我担心真的到了狂热的程度！）。但当我说我不得不原谅那些说他们为我祈祷的朋友时，我并不是在开玩笑。我抵制了回应「谢谢，我很感激，但你有没有牺牲一只山羊？」的诱惑。我对这件事的感觉就像如果他们中的一个人说「我刚刚付钱给一个巫毒医生为你的健康施咒」一样。多么容易上当受骗，浪费了本可以用于更重要项目的钱！不要期望我感激，甚至漠不关心。我确实欣赏你们出于爱和慷慨的精神所做的努力，但希望你们能找到一种更合理的方式来表达它。

这难道不是过于苛刻吗？如果那些真诚地能够做到的人为我祈祷，这肯定不会对世界造成任何伤害！然而，我对此并不完全确定。首先，如果他们真的想做一些有用的事情，他们可以将祈祷的时间和精力投入到一些他们能够有所作为的紧迫项目中。其次，我们现在有相当坚实的基础（例如，最近在哈佛发布的本森研究）来相信代祷祈祷根本不起作用。任何忽视这一研究的人都在不知不觉中削弱了对我的感激之情的尊重。

如果你坚持保持祈祷有效的神话，你欠我们其他人一个面对证据的正当理由。在等待这样的正当理由时，我会原谅你沉溺于你的传统；我知道传统可以多么安慰人。但我希望你认识到，你正在做的事情在道德上至少是有问题的。如果你甚至考虑对一个在治疗你时犯错的医生提起医疗事故诉讼，或者起诉一家在销售给你有害药物之前没有进行所有适当控制测试的制药公司，你必须承认你对医学界对自己保持的高标准理性探究的默许欣赏，然而你继续沉溺于一个完全没有已知理性理由的实践中，并认为自己实际上是在做出贡献。（试着想象一下，如果一家制药公司对你的诉讼轻率地回答「但我们为药物的成功祈祷得很努力！你还想要什么？」你会感到多么愤怒。）

感谢善良而非感谢上帝的好处在于，实际上有很多方式可以回报善良 —— 通过努力创造更多的善良，造福后来者。善良以多种形式存在，不仅仅是医学和科学。感谢兰迪·纽曼的音乐，这些音乐的存在离不开那些美妙的钢琴和录音室，更不用说从巴赫到瓦格纳，再到斯科特·乔普林和披头士的每一位伟大作曲家的音乐贡献。感谢水龙头里的新鲜饮用水，以及我们餐桌上的食物。感谢公正的选举和真实的报道。如果你想表达对善良的感激，你可以种一棵树，喂养一个孤儿，为伊斯兰世界的学龄女孩购买书籍，或者以成千上万种其他方式为这个星球上现在和不久的将来的生活明显改善做出贡献。

或者你可以感谢上帝 —— 但是偿还上帝的想法是荒谬的。一个无所不知、无所不能的存在（拥有一切的人？）能用你微不足道的偿还做什么呢？（而且，根据基督教传统，上帝已经通过牺牲自己的儿子永远地偿还了债务。试着偿还那笔贷款！）是的，我知道，这些主题不应该被理解为字面意思；它们是象征性的。我承认这一点，但是，那么，通过感谢上帝，你实际上在做一些好事的想法也必须被理解为仅仅是象征性的。我更喜欢真实的善良，而不是象征性的善良。

尽管如此，我理解那些为我祈祷的人。他们就像那些顽强的科学家，即使在他们不喜欢的理论面前，优雅地让步之后很久，仍然坚持自己的立场。我赞赏你们对自己信念的忠诚 —— 但请记住：仅仅忠诚于传统是不够的。你必须不断自问：如果我错了怎么办？从长远来看，我认为宗教人士应当以与世俗人士在科学和医学领域相同的道德标准来要求自己。

在那次手术后的十六年里，我出版了七本书和数十篇文章，并在周围人的善意所赋予的额外时间里，将一生的冒险经历装进了环游世界的旅程中。这是何等的幸运啊！

我曾经参加过在西雅图举行的一个周末聚会，旨在激励非常聪明的中学生取得伟大成就。那里有一群明星阵容，包括几位诺贝尔奖获得者、小说家艾米·谭、谷歌的谢尔盖·布林和拉里·佩奇、玻璃雕塑家戴尔·奇胡利以及其他知名人士。我们每个人给这些专注的年轻人做的十五分钟演讲中，最让我印象深刻的是，我们大多数人都在强调运气的作用：我们恰好出现在正确的时间和地点，找到了正确的导师，在黑暗中做出了几次幸运的尝试。这种强烈的谦逊是为了让他们感到轻松，但这会不会产生意想不到的副作用呢？「不要认为有一条可靠的通往伟大的道路。只是随意尝试，如果你幸运，你会像我们一样成功！」我们是不是只是一群彩票中奖者，告诉别人我们的成功没有秘密？

我最近收到了伟大的哲学家 / 潜水员 / 章鱼研究者彼得·戈弗雷 - 史密斯的电子邮件：

嗨，丹，

我正在阅读一堆迈克·莱文的著作（我的塔夫茨同事，我最近与他合著了一篇论文）。

你是如何总是这么快就抓住这些极其有趣的东西的？

已经做了很多年了。

最好的祝福，彼得

实际上，我在撰写这本回忆录时，恰好也在思考类似的问题。毫无疑问，运气在许多时候都起到了关键作用，尤其是在起步阶段，那时找到一种将初步的好运转化为更多好运的方法尤为重要 —— 这就是所谓的「富人越富」。彼得的问题，对我来说，幸运地启发了一个我最近才深刻领悟的答案：他并没有问我如何创造出那些极其有趣的内容；而是问我如何如此迅速地掌握它们。我就像一个收藏家，总是四处搜寻有用的信息碎片。每当发现一些看似不起眼的知识时，我总会想：「这可能在未来的某一天会大有用处。」于是，我便将这些知识如同收集的齿轮、连杆或其他机械零件一样，存放在我那不断扩充的家庭工作室中。我的大脑，这台思维的机器，也同样装满了这些我从各处搜集来的有用信息。我在《直觉泵和其他思维工具》（2013）一书中，分享了超过六打我最珍视的思维工具。我热衷于用各种可能的工具来解决问题，并且几十年来，我一直渴望了解「魔法」背后的原理。我常常引用李·西格尔在其杰作《魔网：印度的奇迹与欺骗》（1991）中的一段话：

「我正在写一本关于魔术的书，」我解释道，然后被问到，「真正的魔术？」人们所说的真正魔术，指的是那些超乎寻常的奇迹、法术和超自然力量。「不，」我回答：「我指的是那些可以通过技巧实现的魔术，而非真正的魔法。」换句话说，真正的魔法，指的是那些现实中不存在的魔法，而那些现实中可以实现的魔术，却并不被视为真正的魔法。（第 425 页）

许多人渴望保护他们心中的「真正魔法」，他们认为哲学是实现这一愿望的理想途径。这成为了一类哲学家的独特标志。然而，也有反哲学家，他们面对其他哲学家造成的混乱，决心要清理这些纷扰。我所敬仰的人 —— 科学家和哲学家 —— 他们拥有洞察魔术和幻觉背后机制的直觉。他们不仅仅是怀疑论者和揭穿者，更是建设性的解释者，他们试图构建能够取代传统哲学观点的可验证理论。

早在 1965 年我的博士论文中，我就坚信，理解心灵和意识的关键在于多层次的自然选择进化，我着手构建一个灵活的框架来探索这一理论。我始终将哲学争论置于次要位置。我的观点在多个学科的研究者中引起了共鸣。他们以各自的方式理解了我的观点，并看到了如何为我的理论框架添砖加瓦，同时也修正了他们自己研究中的不足。他们邀请我参与学术交流，成为一名积极的对话者。我无需主动寻求他们的认可，他们已经主动向我伸出了合作之手。

我似乎无意中创造了一个智慧的磁场，它不断吸引着那些智力超群的人进入我的生活圈。我习惯了身边围绕着比我知识渊博的人，我总是乐于向他们学习，尤其是在我与他们意见不合时。我最喜欢的一些争论和例子，是在与那些我大部分都持反对意见的思想家激烈辩论中形成的，我现在对他们的立场理解得比初次接触时更加深刻。物理学家沃尔夫冈·泡利曾批评另一位物理学家的观点「甚至都不算错」，而我则趁机试图修正物理学家罗杰·彭罗斯、语言学家诺姆·乔姆斯基、神经科学家克里斯托夫·科赫以及进化生物学家斯蒂芬·杰伊·古尔德和大卫·斯隆·威尔逊等人的一些错误观点。此外，我与哲学家托马斯·内格尔、杰里·福多、约翰·塞尔和大卫·查默斯等人的长期争论也是我思考的源泉。如果没有这些卓越的错误需要纠正，借助我的思考工具，我会在哪里呢？（例如，我利用约翰·霍顿·康威的生命游戏，找到了福多的「工业强度现实主义」和保罗·丘奇兰德的「消除主义」之间的平衡点，在《真实模式》[1991] 中，这是我最有影响力的论文之一。）我没有足够的篇幅详细讨论所有重要细节，但尾注提供了链接，供那些想要检查我的修正并自行决定的人参考。

到目前为止，我过着一种极其冒险和充实的生活，远远超出了我年轻时最奢侈的幻想 —— 而我是一个自信满满的年轻人，有着雄心壮志。这是怎么发生的？这一切都只是运气，还是「关系」，或者我可以为自己达到目前的幸福状态而获得一些赞誉？我在任何意义上都配得上我现在享受的好处吗？

我相信自由意志，不是那种超自然的魔法，而是实实在在的。我认为，那些在世界上行善的人应该得到赞扬和奖赏，而那些做恶的人，如果是能够自我控制的成年人，则应该受到惩罚。我坚信自由意志并不受决定论的威胁，为此我写了三本书和许多文章来捍卫这一看似矛盾的观点。决定论认为「在任何时刻，只有一个可能的未来」，但这并不意味着一切都是注定的。我们和其他自主的个体每天都在避免一些事情的发生。决定论并没有束缚我们的行动，它不会阻止我们做出选择，然后重新思考，改变方向，从错误中吸取教训。决定论不是操纵我们的幕后黑手。如果你是一个正常的成年人，你有足够的自制力来保持你的自主性，从而承担起责任，在充满诱惑和干扰的世界中。但即使我正确地认为决定论并不威胁到责任或自主性，这也不意味着我就是一个异常幸运的人，能够充分利用我所拥有的好运。

实际上，我并没有充分利用我的幸运。如果我的性格更坚强，我本可以做得更多。我有些懒惰，是一个容易分心的不守纪律的读者，我对那些浪费时间的东西有着无法满足的欲望，比如报纸上的漫画、填字游戏、拼字游戏（更好的是：军舰鸟，一种用拼字游戏牌但没有棋盘玩的激烈游戏）、数独和魔方。我有一个聪明的朋友，他小时候对桥牌上瘾，以至于他大学辍学了，如果我在错误的时间找到了一个好的搭档，我本可以做同样的事情。我在哈佛差点犯了一个错误，没有报名参加一门会干扰我在哈斯蒂布丁俱乐部上午晚些时候的台球游戏的课程！我当时在想什么？

当我回想起那些险些让我失败的逃脱时，我深信是那种及时的自我反省，经常在关键时刻挽救了我。此外，在面对艰难的道德抉择时，我总是愿意向朋友寻求并接受他们的建议，尤其是我的妻子苏珊，我们已相伴六十年。

从我如何规划自己的教育和如何成为一个优秀的思考者中，我们可以汲取许多宝贵的教训。（哲学家唐·罗斯曾这样评价我：「丹认为谦虚是一种应该保留给特殊场合的美德。」）如果我不认为我有可以有益地传授给读者的东西 —— 我的成功秘诀，我的好技巧和策略，我处理人际关系和问题的方式 —— 我就不会写这本书。确实，有许多哲学家比我更聪明，是更好的学者，在辩论中更快，比我更擅长哲学家的技术动作。他们会告诉你这一点，我也会同意他们。但正如我在牛津的论文导师吉尔伯特·赖尔在 60 年代在萨尔茨堡与我的同事畅饮时所说的那样，「虽然有比丹尼特更聪明的人，但他内心燃烧着热情。」这份热情，我已经依赖了超过半个世纪。

正如你所见，我既不自谦，也不像我所知的某些思想家那样过于自信。约翰·塞尔，我最激烈的批评者之一，实际上与我有很多相似之处：他自信满满，对那些琐碎的哲学争论不耐烦，愿意将一些受人尊敬的思想流派视为无稽之谈。当他遇到一个难以理解的哲学论点或立场时，他会用自己的话重新表述 —— 用他自己理解的方式。这正是我也做的事情。但是，当塞尔对一个困难想法的解读在他看来是荒谬的时候，他会强烈地表达出来。我不会这样做。我保留判断。我反思：这些捍卫这种观点的人似乎不是傻瓜；也许我误解了他们。我回到他们的工作中，看看我是否能找到他们观点的更好版本。有时我找不到，那时我可以像塞尔一样成为一个严厉的批评者。但有时 —— 实际上通常 —— 我能找到一个更好的版本，那时我就学到了一些东西。塞尔的世界充满了他认为的哲学上的笨蛋；而我的世界充满了博学、聪明、勤奋但往往自我挫败的哲学家，他们展示了自己最好的想法。如果哲学家普遍像塞尔似乎认为的那样愚蠢，那么为什么还有人想成为哲学家呢？（卡尔·波普尔爵士是另一位哲学家，他对那些与他意见相左的人的低评价让我想知道他怎么能忍受成为哲学家。）

我并非始终对自己研究的话题充满信心。实际上，我曾陷入漫长而令人恐惧的低谷，怀疑自己是否适合从事哲学工作，甚至考虑过放弃哲学，将雕塑作为职业而非业余爱好。稍后我会详细讲述那些艰难时期。现在，在我讲述自己在学术界的成长历程之前，我想对哲学家做出两个概括：任何成为哲学家的人，如果从未对选择哲学作为人生道路产生过严重怀疑，那么他可能不是一个优秀的哲学家。同样，如果一个人从未对自己的哲学能力产生过怀疑，他也不太可能是一个优秀的哲学家。确实，有众多「杰出的」哲学家似乎从未表现出这些不安全感，但我认为他们的工作往往流于表面，只是在无关紧要的问题上展示技巧。我称这种行为为「高阶的 chmess 真理」。所谓「Chmess」，是我创造的一个国际象棋变体，其中国王可以向任何方向移动两个方格。这个游戏可能从未被玩过，也从未值得玩过，而且不值得去探究。证明关于 chmess 的真理虽然与证明关于国际象棋的真理一样具有挑战性，但重要性却大打折扣。没有人关心，也不应该关心。神经心理学家唐纳德·赫布曾说：「如果不值得做，那就不值得做好。」如果严格遵循这一原则，许多学术领域的尘封角落 —— 不仅仅是哲学 —— 将会被清空。但我坚信，没有人有资格评判哪些智力追求不值得支持，因此我们应当承认，学术界在某种程度上是一个奢侈的事业，维持着无数可能永远不会「自负盈亏」的项目。我们绝不能让学术界沦为仅仅是培养未来工人的场所。让各种思想自由绽放，但要记住，大多数最终都会凋谢。
