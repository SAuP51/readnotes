Aphorism 

### 001

Man is Nature's agent and interpreter; he does and understands only as much as he has observed of the order of nature in fact or by inference; he does not know and cannot do more.

人类是自然的代理和解释者；他的所作所为和理解的知识仅限于他对自然秩序的实际观察或推理所及；超出这个范围，他便不知道，也无法做到。

### 002

Neither the bare hand nor the unaided intellect has much power; the work is done by tools and assistance, and the intellect needs them as much as the hand. As the hand's tools either prompt or guide its motions, so the mind's tools either prompt or warn the intellect.

仅凭裸手或单靠未受辅助的智力，力量有限；完成工作需要工具和帮助，智力对此的需求不亚于手部。正如手部工具促进或指导手的动作一样，心智工具也能促进或提醒智力。

### 003

Human knowledge and human power come to the same thing, because ignorance of cause frustrates eﬀect. For Nature is conquered only by obedience; and that which in thought is a cause, is like a rule in practice.

人类的知识和力量本质上是同一事物，因为对原因的无知会妨碍效果的发生。因为只有顺从自然，才能征服自然；在思考中作为原因的，在实践中就像是规则。

### 004

All man can do to achieve results1 is to bring natural bodies together and take them apart; Nature does the rest internally.

人类为了获得成果所能做的一切，就是将自然界的物体组合起来并拆分开；自然本身会在内部完成剩余的部分。

[1] opus, opera: widely used throughout The New Organon in a variety of senses, this word has been translated, according to context, as ‘results' or ‘eﬀects' or ‘work'. The related operatio is usually given as ‘operation' or ‘practice', and operativus as ‘practical' or ‘applied' (as in pars operativa).

### 005

Mechanic, mathematician, physician, alchemist and magician do meddle with nature (for results); but all, as things are, to little eﬀect and with slender success.

机械师、数学家、医生、炼金术士和魔法师都在干预自然（以求成果）；但在目前的情况下，他们的效果甚微，成功寥寥。

### 006

There is something insane and self-contradictory in supposing that things that have never yet been done can be done except by means never tried.

认为从未完成过的事情可以通过从未尝试过的方法完成，这种想法是疯狂且自相矛盾的。

### 007

The creations of mind and hand look quite proliﬁc in books and manufac-

tures. But all that varied production consists in extreme subtlety and in

deductions from a few things that have become known, not in the number

of Axioms.

### 008

Even the results which have been discovered already are due more to

chance and experience than to sciences; for the sciences we now have are

no more than elegant arrangements of things previously discovered, not

methods of discovery or pointers to new results.

### 009

The cause and root of nearly all the deﬁciencies of the sciences is just this:

that while we mistakenly admire and praise the powers of the human mind,

we do not seek its true supports.

### 010

The subtlety of nature far surpasses the subtlety of sense and intellect, so

that men's ﬁne2 meditations, speculations and endless discussions are quite

insane, except that there is no one who notices.

2 Pulcher seems always to be used ironically in The New Organon.

### 011

As the sciences in their present state are useless for the discovery of works,

so logic in its present state is useless for the discovery of sciences.

### 012

Current logic is good for establishing and ﬁxing errors (which are them-

selves based on common notions) rather than for inquiring into truth;

hence it is not useful, it is positively harmful.

### 013

The syllogism is not applied to the principles of the sciences, and is applied

in vain to the middle axioms, since it is by no means equal to the subtlety

of nature. It therefore compels assent without reference to things.3

### 014

The syllogism consists of propositions, propositions consist of words, and

words are counters for notions. Hence if the notions themselves (this is the

basis of the matter) are confused and abstracted from things without care,

there is nothing sound in what is built on them. The only hope is true

induction.

### 015

There is nothing sound in the notions of logic and physics: neither sub-

stance, nor quality, nor action and passion, nor being itself are good notions;

much less heavy, light, dense, rare, wet, dry, generation, corruption, attraction,

repulsion, element, matter, form and so on; all fanciful and ill deﬁned.4

### 016

The notions of the lowest species, man, dog, dove, and of the immediate per-

ceptions of sense, hot, cold, white, black, do not much mislead, though, from

4 I owe ‘all fanciful and ill deﬁned' to Kitchin's translation.

The New Organon

the ﬂux of matter and the conﬂict of things, they are sometimes confused;

all the others (that men have so far made use of) are aberrations, not being

drawn and abstracted from things in the proper ways.

### 017

Passion and aberration occur no less in forming axioms than in abstracting

notions, even in the principles that depend on ordinary induction. But this

is much more the case with the lower axioms and propositions which the

syllogism generates.

### 018

The things that have hitherto been discovered in the sciences all ﬁt nicely

into common notions; in order to penetrate to the more inward and remote

parts of nature, both notions and axioms must be abstracted from things in

a more certain, better-grounded way; and a more certain and altogether

better intellectual procedure must come into use.

### 019

There are, and can be, only two ways to investigate and discover truth. The

one leaps from sense and particulars to the most general axioms, and from

these principles and their settled truth, determines and discovers inter-

mediate axioms; this is the current way. The other elicits axioms from sense

and particulars, rising in a gradual and unbroken ascent to arrive at last at

the most general axioms; this is the true way, but it has not been tried.

### 020

Left to itself the intellect goes the same way as it does when it follows the

order of dialectic (i.e. the ﬁrst of the two ways above). The mind loves to

leap to generalities, so that it can rest; it only takes it a little while to get

tired of experience. These faults have simply been magniﬁed by dialectic,

for ostentatious disputes.



Book I

XXI

In a sober, grave and patient character the intellect left to itself (especially

if unimpeded by received doctrines) makes some attempt on that other way,

which is the right way, but with little success; since without guidance and

assistance it is a thing inadequate and altogether incompetent to overcome

the obscurity of things.

XXII

Both ways start from sense and particulars, and come to rest in the most

general; but they are vastly diﬀerent. For one merely brushes experience

and particulars in passing, the other deals fully and properly with them;

one forms certain abstract and useless generalities from the beginning, the

other rises step by step to what is truly better known by nature.

XXIII

There is a great distance between the illusions5 of the human mind and the

ideas of the divine mind; that is, between what are no more than empty

opinions and what we discover are the true prints and signatures made on

the creation.

XXIV

Axioms formed by argumentation cannot be good at all for the discovery

of new results, because the subtlety of nature far surpasses the subtlety of

argumentation. But arguments duly and properly abstracted from partic-

ulars readily indicate and suggest new particulars; this is what makes the

sciences practical.

XXV

The axioms currently in use have come from limited and common experi-

ence and the few particulars that occur most often, and are more or less

made and stretched to ﬁt them; so that it is no surprise if they do not lead

5 idola. See further note on ..



The New Organon

to new particulars. And if it happens that a new instance turns up which

was not previously noticed or known, the axiom is saved by some frivolous

distinction when it would be more truthful to amend the axiom.

XXVI

For the purposes of teaching, we have chosen to call the reasoning which

men usually apply to nature anticipations of nature (because it is a risky,

hasty business), and to call the reasoning which is elicited from things in

proper ways interpretation of nature.

XXVII

Anticipations are quite strong enough to induce agreement, since even if

men were mad in one common way together, they could agree among

themselves well enough.

XXVIII

In fact anticipations are much more powerful in winning assent than inter-

pretations; they are gathered from just a few instances, especially those

which are common and familiar, which merely brush past the intellect and

ﬁll the imagination. Interpretations by contrast are gathered piece by piece

from things which are quite various and widely scattered, and cannot

suddenly strike the intellect. So that, to common opinion, they cannot help

seeming hard and incongruous, almost like mysteries of faith.

XXIX

In sciences which are based on opinions and accepted views, the use of

anticipations and dialectic is acceptable where the need is to compel assent

without reference to things.

XXX

Even if all the minds of all the ages should come together and pool their

labours and communicate their thoughts, there will be no great progress

made in sciences by means of anticipations, because errors which are radical



Book I

and lie in the fundamental organisation of the mind are not put right by

subsequent eﬀorts and remedies, however brilliant.

XXXI

It is futile to expect a great advancement in the sciences from overlaying6

and implanting new things on the old; a new beginning7 has to be made

from the lowest foundations, unless one is content to go round in circles

for ever, with meagre, almost negligible, progress.

XXXII

The honour of the ancient authors stands ﬁrm, and so does everyone's

honour; we are not introducing a comparison of minds or talents but a

comparison of ways; and we are not taking the role of a judge but of a

guide.

XXXIII

No judgement can rightly be made of our way (one must say frankly), nor

of the discoveries made by it, by means of anticipations (i.e. the reasoning

currently in use); for one must not require it to be approved by the judge-

ment of the very thing which is itself being judged.

XXXIV

There is no easy way of teaching or explaining what we are introducing;

because anything new will still be understood by analogy with the old.

XXXV

Borgia said of the expedition of the French into Italy that they had come

with chalk in their hands to mark their billets, not with arms to force their

way through. Likewise it is our design for our teaching to ﬁnd its way into

suitable, capable minds; there is no room for refutations when we disagree

about principles and notions themselves and even about the forms of proof.

The New Organon

XXXVI

There remains one simple way of getting our teaching across, namely to

introduce men to actual particulars and their sequences and orders, and for

men in their turn to pledge to abstain for a while from notions, and begin

to get used to actual things.

XXXVII

In its initial positions our way agrees to some extent with the method of the

supporters of lack of conviction;8 but in the end our ways are far apart and

strongly opposed. They assert simply that nothing can be known; but we

say that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use.

They thereupon proceed to destroy the authority of sense and intellect; but

we devise and provide assistance to them.

XXXVIII

The illusions and false notions which have got a hold on men's intellects in

the past and are now profoundly rooted in them, not only block their minds

so that it is diﬃcult for truth to gain access, but even when access has been

granted and allowed, they will once again, in the very renewal of the

sciences, oﬀer resistance and do mischief unless men are forewarned and

arm themselves against them as much as possible.

XXXIX

There are four kinds of illusions which block men's minds. For instruction's

sake, we have given them the following names: the ﬁrst kind are called idols

of the tribe; the second idols of the cave; the third idols of the marketplace; the

fourth idols of the theatre.9

8 Bacon uses the Greek term acatalepsia, the mark of ancient Sceptics. At . he distinguishes them

from what he regards as Pyrrho's more radical school of ancient Sceptics, whom he calls Ephectici,

‘those who suspend judgement'.

9 It has seemed better to accept the time-honoured translations of the four classes of idola, as given in

this aphorism. We have however sometimes chosen to translate idola itself, apart from these four

phrases, as ‘illusions'.



Book I

XL

Formation of notions and axioms by means of true induction is certainly an

appropriate way to banish idols and get rid of them; but it is also very use-

ful to identify the idols. Instruction about idols has the same relation to the

interpretation of nature as teaching the sophistic refutations has to ordinary

logic.

XLI

The idols of the tribe are founded in human nature itself and in the very tribe

or race of mankind. The assertion that the human senses are the measure

of things is false; to the contrary, all perceptions, both of sense and mind,

are relative to man, not to the universe. The human understanding is like

an uneven mirror receiving rays from things and merging its own nature

with the nature of things, which thus distorts and corrupts it.

XLII

The idols of the cave are the illusions of the individual man. For (apart from

the aberrations of human nature in general) each man has a kind of

individual cave or cavern which fragments and distorts the light of nature.

This may happen either because of the unique and particular nature of each

man; or because of his upbringing and the company he keeps; or because

of his reading of books and the authority of those whom he respects and

admires; or because of the diﬀerent impressions things make on diﬀerent

minds, preoccupied and prejudiced perhaps, or calm and detached, and

so on. The evident consequence is that the human spirit (in its diﬀerent

dispositions in diﬀerent men) is a variable thing, quite irregular, almost

haphazard. Heraclitus10 well said that men seek knowledge in lesser,

private worlds, not in the great or common world.

XLIII

There are also illusions which seem to arise by agreement and from men's

association with each other, which we call idols of the marketplace; we take

10 Heraclitus, fr. . A Greek philosopher of the late sixth century, Heraclitus of Ephesus is one of the

early Greek philosophers whom as a group Bacon much admired. See ..



The New Organon

the name from human exchange and community. Men associate through

talk; and words are chosen to suit the understanding of the common

people. And thus a poor and unskilful code of words incredibly obstructs

the understanding. The deﬁnitions and explanations with which learned

men have been accustomed to protect and in some way liberate themselves,

do not restore the situation at all. Plainly words do violence to the under-

standing, and confuse everything; and betray men into countless empty

disputes and ﬁctions.

XLIV

Finally there are the illusions which have made their homes in men's minds

from the various dogmas of diﬀerent philosophies, and even from mistaken

rules of demonstration. These I call idols of the theatre, for all the philoso-

phies that men have learned or devised are, in our opinion, so many plays

produced and performed which have created false and ﬁctitious worlds. We

are not speaking only of the philosophies and sects now in vogue or even of

the ancient ones; many other such plays could be composed and concocted,

seeing that the causes of their very diﬀerent errors have a great deal in

common. And we do not mean this only of the universal philosophies, but

also of many principles and axioms of the sciences which have grown strong

from tradition, belief and inertia. But we must speak at greater length and

separately of each diﬀerent kind of idol, to give warning to the human

understanding.

XLV

The human understanding from its own peculiar nature willingly supposes

a greater order and regularity in things than it ﬁnds, and though there are

many things in nature which are unique and full of disparities, it invents

parallels and correspondences and non-existent connections. Hence those

false notions that in the heavens all things move in perfect circles and the total

rejection of spiral lines and dragons (except in name). Hence the element

of ﬁre and its orbit have been introduced to make a quaternion with the

other three elements, which are accessible to the senses. Also a ratio of ten

to one is arbitrarily imposed on the elements (as they call them), which is

the ratio of their respective rarities; and other such nonsense. This vanity

prevails not only in dogmas but also in simple notions.



Book I

XLVI

Once a man's understanding has settled on something (either because it is

an accepted belief or because it pleases him), it draws everything else also

to support and agree with it. And if it encounters a larger number of more

powerful countervailing examples, it either fails to notice them, or dis-

regards them, or makes ﬁne distinctions to dismiss and reject them, and all

this with much dangerous prejudice, to preserve the authority of its ﬁrst

conceptions. So when someone was shown a votive tablet in a temple

dedicated, in fulﬁlment of a vow, by some men who had escaped the

danger of shipwreck, and was pressed to say whether he would now recog-

nise the divinity of the gods, he made a good reply when he retorted:

‘Where are the oﬀerings of those who made vows and perished?'11 The

same method is found perhaps in every superstition, like astrology, dreams,

omens, divine judgements and so on: people who take pleasure in such

vanities notice the results when they are fulﬁlled, but ignore and overlook

them when they fail, though they do fail more often than not. This failing

ﬁnds its way into the sciences and philosophies in a much more subtle way,

in that once something has been settled, it infects everything else (even

things that are much more certain and powerful), and brings them under

its control. And even apart from the pleasure and vanity we mentioned, it

is an innate and constant mistake in the human understanding to be much

more moved and excited by aﬃrmatives than by negatives, when rightly

and properly it should make itself equally open to both; and in fact, to the

contrary, in the formation of any true axiom, there is superior force in a

negative instance.

XLVII

The human understanding is most aﬀected by things which have the ability

to strike and enter the mind all at once and suddenly, and to ﬁll and expand

the imagination. It pretends and supposes that in some admittedly imper-

ceptible way, everything else is just like the few things that took the mind by

storm. The understanding is very slow and ill adapted to make the long

journey to those remote and heterogeneous instances which test axioms as in

a ﬁre, unless it is made to do so by harsh rules and the force of authority.

11 This story is told of Diagoras the Atheist at Cicero, On the Nature of the Gods, ., and of Diogenes

the Cynic at Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, ..



The New Organon

XLVIII

The human understanding is ceaselessly active, and cannot stop or rest,

and seeks to go further; but in vain. Therefore it is unthinkable that there

is some boundary or farthest point of the world; it always appears, almost

by necessity, that there is something beyond. Again it cannot be conceived

how eternity has come down to this day; since the distinction which is com-

monly accepted that there is an inﬁnity of the past and an inﬁnity of the future

can no way stand, because it would follow that there is one inﬁnity which

is greater than another inﬁnity, and that inﬁnity is being consumed and

tends towards the ﬁnite. There is a similar subtlety about ever divisible

lines, from thought's lack of restraint. This indiscipline of the mind works

with greater damage on the discovery of causes: for though the most

universal things in nature must be brute facts,12 which are just as they are

found, and are not themselves truly causable, the human understanding,

not knowing how to rest, still seeks things better known.13 And then as it

strives to go further, it falls back on things that are more familiar, namely

ﬁnal causes, which are plainly derived from the nature of man rather than

of the universe, and from this origin have wonderfully corrupted philosophy.

It is as much a mark of an inept and superﬁcial thinker to look for a cause

in the most universal cases as not to feel the need of a cause in subordinate

and derivative cases.

XLIX

The human understanding is not composed of dry light,14 but is subject to

inﬂuence from the will and the emotions, a fact that creates fanciful knowl-

edge; man prefers to believe what he wants to be true. He rejects what is

diﬃcult because he is too impatient to make the investigation; he rejects

sensible ideas, because they limit his hopes; he rejects the deeper truths of

nature because of superstition; he rejects the light of experience, because

he is arrogant and fastidious, believing that the mind should not be seen to

be spending its time on mean, unstable things; and he rejects anything

unorthodox because of common opinion. In short, emotion marks and

brute facts'.

Book I

stains the understanding in countless ways which are sometimes impossible

to perceive.

L

But much the greatest obstacle and distortion of human understanding

comes from the dullness, limitations and deceptions of the senses; so that

things that strike the senses have greater inﬂuence than even powerful

things which do not directly strike the senses. And therefore thought

virtually stops at sight; so that there is little or no notice taken of things that

cannot be seen. And so all operation of spirits enclosed in tangible bodies

remains hidden and escapes men's notice. And all the more subtle structural

change15 in the parts of dense objects (which is commonly called alteration,

although in truth it is movement of particles) is similarly hidden. Yet unless

the two things mentioned are investigated and brought to the light, nothing

important can be done in nature as far as results are concerned. Again, the

very nature of the common air and of all the bodies which surpass air in

rarity (of which there are many) is virtually unknown. For by itself sense is

weak and prone to error, nor do instruments for amplifying and sharpen-

ing the senses do very much. And yet every interpretation of nature which

has a chance to be true is achieved by instances, and suitable and relevant

experiments, in which sense only gives a judgement on the experiment,

while the experiment gives a judgement on nature and the thing itself.

LI

The human understanding is carried away to abstractions by its own

nature, and pretends that things which are in ﬂux are unchanging. But it

is better to dissect nature than to abstract; as the school of Democritus16

did, which penetrated more deeply into nature than the others. We

should study matter, and its structure (schematismus), and structural

change (meta-schematismus), and pure act, and the law of act or motion; for

forms are ﬁgments of the human mind, unless one chooses to give the name

of forms to these laws of act.

LII

Such then are the illusions that we call idols of the tribe, which have their

origin either in the regularity of the substance of the human spirit; or in

its prejudices; or in its limitations; or in its restless movement; or in the

inﬂuence of the emotions; or in the limited powers of the senses; or in the

mode of impression.

LIII

Idols of the cave have their origin in the individual nature of each man's

mind and body; and also in his education, way of life and chance events.

This category is varied and complex, and we shall enumerate the cases in

which there is the greatest danger and which do most to spoil the clarity of

the understanding.

LIV

Men fall in love with particular pieces of knowledge and thoughts: either

because they believe themselves to be their authors and inventors; or because

they have put a great deal of labour into them, and have got very used to them.

If such men betake themselves to philosophy and universal speculation, they

distort and corrupt them to suit their prior fancies. This is seen most con-

spicuously in Aristotle,17 who utterly enslaved his natural philosophy to his

logic, and made it a matter of disputation and almost useless. Chemists as

a group have built up a fantastic philosophy out of a few experiments at

the furnace, which has a very limited range; and Gilbert18 too, after his

strenuous researches on the magnet, immediately concocted a philosophy

in conformity with the thing that had the dominating inﬂuence over him.

LV

The biggest, and radical, diﬀerence between minds as far as philosophy

and the sciences is concerned, is this: that some minds are more eﬀective

and more suited to noticing the diﬀerences between things, others to

noticing their similarities. For sharp and steady minds can ﬁx their

attention, and concentrate for long periods on every subtle diﬀerence; but

sublime and discursive minds discern even the slightest and most general

similarities in things, and bring them into relationship; both minds easily

go to extremes by grasping at degrees of things or at shadows.

LVI

There are some minds which are devoted to admiration for antiquity,

others to the love and embrace of novelty, and few have the temperament

to keep to the mean without criticising the true achievements of the

ancients or despising the real contributions of the moderns. This is a great

loss to the sciences and to philosophy, since these are not judgements but

enthusiasm for antiquity or modernity; and truth is not to be sought from

the felicity of a particular time, which is a variable thing, but from the light

of nature, which is eternal. We must reject these enthusiasms, and ensure

that the understanding is not diverted into compliance with them.

LVII

Observation of nature and of bodies in their simple parts fractures and

diminishes the understanding; observation of nature and of bodies in their

composition and complex structure stupeﬁes and confounds the under-

standing. This is best seen in a comparison of the school of Leucippus

and Democritus19 with the other philosophies. It is so concerned with the

particles of things that it almost forgets their structures; while the others

are so astonished by beholding the structures that they do not penetrate to

the simple parts of nature. These kinds of observation therefore need to be

alternated and taken in turn, so that the understanding may be rendered

both penetrating and comprehensive; and the defects we mentioned

avoided, with the illusions they generate.

LVIII

Let such be the care in observation which will banish and get rid of idols

of the cave, which mostly have their origin in a dominance or excess of

19 Greek atomists. See n.  above.



The New Organon

composition and division, or in partiality for historical periods, or in the

large and minute objects. And in general every student of nature must hold

in suspicion whatever most captures and holds his understanding; and this

warning needs to be all the more applied in issues of this kind, to keep the

understanding clear and balanced.

LIX

But the idols of the marketplace20 are the biggest nuisance of all, because they

have stolen into the understanding from the covenant21 on words and

names. For men believe that their reason controls words. But it is also true

that words retort and turn their force back upon the understanding; and

this has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistic and unproductive.

And words are mostly bestowed to suit the capacity of the common man,

and they dissect things along the lines most obvious to the common under-

standing. And when a sharper understanding, or more careful observation,

attempts to draw those lines more in accordance with nature, words resist.

Hence it happens that the great and solemn controversies of learned men

often end in disputes about words and names. But it would be wiser (in the

prudent manner of the mathematicians) to begin with them, and to reduce

them to order by means of deﬁnitions. However, in the things of nature and

matter, these deﬁnitions cannot cure this fault. For the deﬁnitions them-

selves consist of words, and words beget words, so that it is necessary to

have recourse to particular instances and their sequences and orders; as we

shall explain soon when we deal with the method and manner of forming

notions and axioms.

LX

The illusions which are imposed on the understanding by words are of

two kinds. They are either names of things that do not exist (for as

there are things that lack names because they have not been observed,

so there are also names that lack things because they have been imagina-

tively assumed), or they are the names of things which exist but are

20 We have retained the traditional translation of this phrase because it is so familiar. However,

‘marketplace' has quite the wrong connotation in suggesting some economic notion. A better

rendering of ‘forum' would be ‘townsquare'; it is the place where men meet and talk and reinforce

each others' ‘idols', or ‘illusions'. On ‘idols' see ‘Plan of the Work', n. .

21 foedus: for agreement as the origin of the meaning of words, see above, ..

confused and badly deﬁned, being abstracted from things rashly and

unevenly. Of the former sort are fortune, the ﬁrst mover, the orbs of

the planets, the element of ﬁre and ﬁctions of that kind, which owe their

origin to false and groundless theories. Idols of this kind are easily got

rid of; they can be eradicated by constantly rejecting and outdating the

theories.

But the other kind of idol is complex and deep-seated, being caused by

poor and unskilful abstraction. For example, let us take a word (‘wet' if

you like) and see how the things signiﬁed by this word go together; it will

be found that the word ‘wet' is simply an undiscriminating token for

diﬀerent actions which have no constancy or common denominator. For

it signiﬁes both what is easily poured around another object; and what

is without its own boundaries and unstable; and what easily gives way

all round; and what easily divides and disperses; and what easily combines

and comes together; and what easily ﬂows and is set in motion; and what

easily adheres to another body and makes it wet; and what is easily reduced

to a liquid, or liqueﬁes, from a previous solid state. Hence when it comes

to predicating and applying this word, if you take it one way, a ﬂame is

wet; if in another, air is not wet; if in another, a speck of dust is wet; if in

another, glass is wet; it is easily seen that this notion has been rashly

abstracted from water and common and ordinary liquids only, without any

proper veriﬁcation.

There are various degrees of deﬁciency and error in words. Least faulty

is the class of names of particular substances, especially the lowest, well-

derived species (e.g. the notions of chalk and mud are good, of earth bad);

next is the class of names of actions, such as ‘generate', ‘corrupt', ‘alter';

the faultiest class is of the names of qualities (with the exception of direct

objects of sense), such as ‘heavy', ‘light', ‘rare', ‘dense' etc.; but in all

classes, inevitably, some notions are a little better than others, depending

on the number of each that come to the notice of the human senses.

Idols of the theatre are not innate or stealthily slipped into the understand-

ing; they are openly introduced and accepted on the basis of fairytale

theories and mistaken rules of proof. It is not at all consistent with our

argument to attempt or undertake to refute them.

There is no possibility of argument, since we do not agree either about



The New Organon

the principles or about the proofs.22 It is a happy consequence that the

ancients may keep their reputation. I take nothing from them, since the

question is simply about the way. As the saying goes, a lame man on the

right road beats the runner who misses his way. It is absolutely clear that if

you run the wrong way, the better and faster you are, the more you go

astray.

Our method of discovery in the sciences is designed not to leave much

to the sharpness and strength of the individual talent; it more or less

equalises talents and intellects. In drawing a straight line or a perfect circle,

a good deal depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand, but little

or nothing if a ruler or a compass is used. Our method is exactly the same.

But though there is no point in speciﬁc refutations, something must be said

about the sects and kinds of such theories; and then of the external signs

that the situation is bad; and lastly of the reasons for so much failure, and

such persistent and general agreement in error; so that there may be easier

access to true things, and the human understanding may be more willing

to cleanse itself and dismiss its idols.

LXII

There are many idols of the theatre, or theories, and there could be many

more, and perhaps one day there will be. For if men's minds had not been

preoccupied for so many centuries now with religion and theology, and if

also civil governments (especially monarchies) had not been hostile to such

novelties even in thought, so that men could not get involved in them with-

out danger and damage to their fortunes, and would not only be deprived

of reward but exposed to contempt and envy, without doubt a number of

other philosophical and theoretical sects would have been introduced, like

those which once ﬂourished in great variety in ancient Greece. For just as

several accounts of the heavens can be fashioned from the phenomena of the

air, so, and much more, various dogmas can be based and constructed upon

the phenomena of philosophy. And the stories of this kind of theatre have

something else in common with the dramatist's theatre, that narratives

made up for the stage are neater and more elegant than true stories from

history, and are the sort of thing people prefer.

In general, for the content of philosophy, either much is made of little or

22 This is a legal maxim which Bacon adapts to his method.



Book I

little is made of much, so that in both cases philosophy is built upon an

excessively narrow basis of experience and natural history, and bases its

statements on fewer instances than is proper. Philosophers of the rational

type are diverted from experience by the variety of common phenomena,

which have not been certainly understood or carefully examined and con-

sidered; they depend for the rest on reﬂection and intellectual exercise.

There are also philosophers of another type who have laboured carefully

and faithfully over a few experiments, and have had the temerity to tease

out their philosophies from them and build them up; the rest they twist to

ﬁt that pattern in wonderful ways.

There is also a third type, who from faith and respect mingle theology

and traditions; some of them have been unfortunately misled by vanity to

try to derive sciences from Spirits and Genii. And so the root of errors and

false philosophy is of three kinds: Sophistic, Empirical and Superstitious.

LXIII

The most obvious example of the ﬁrst type is Aristotle, who spoils natural

philosophy with his dialectic. He constructed the world of categories; he

attributed to the human soul the noblest substance, a genus based on words

of second intention; he transformed the interaction of dense and rare, by

which bodies occupy greater and smaller dimensions or spaces, into the

unilluminating distinction between act and potentiality; he insisted that

each individual body has a unique and speciﬁc motion, and if they partici-

pate in some other motion, that motion is due to a diﬀerent reason; and he

imposed innumerable other things on nature at his own whim. He was

always more concerned with how one might explain oneself in replying,

and to giving some positive response in words, than of the internal truth of

things; and this shows up best if we compare his philosophy with other

philosophies in repute among the Greeks. The ‘similar substances'23 of

Anaxagoras, the atoms of Leucippus and Democritus, the earth and sky of

Parmenides, the strife and friendship of Empedocles, the dissolution of

bodies into the undiﬀerentiated nature of ﬁre and their return to solidity

in Heraclitus, all have something of natural philosophy in them, and have

the feel of nature and experience and bodies;24 whereas Aristotle's physics

too often sound like mere terms of dialectic, which he rehashed under a

23 homoiomera

24 These are all pre-Socratic Greek philosophers of the late sixth and the ﬁfth centuries .



The New Organon

more solemn name in his metaphysics, claiming to be more of a realist, not

a nominalist. And no one should be impressed because in his books On

Animals and in his Problems and other treatises there is often discussion of

experiments. He had in fact made up his mind beforehand, and did not

properly consult experience as the basis of his decisions and axioms; after

making his decisions arbitrarily, he parades experience around, distorted

to suit his opinions, a captive. Hence on this ground too he is guiltier

than his modern followers (the scholastic philosophers) who have wholly

abandoned experience.

LXIV

The empirical brand of philosophy generates more deformed and freakish

dogmas than the sophistic or rational kind, because it is not founded on

the light of common notions (which though weak and superﬁcial, is some-

how universal and relevant to many things) but on the narrow and un-

illuminating basis of a handful of experiments. Such a philosophy seems

probable and almost certain to those who are engaged every day in experi-

ments of this kind and have corrupted their imagination with them; to

others it seems unbelievable and empty. There is a notable example of this

among the chemists and their dogmas; otherwise it scarcely exists at this

time, except perhaps in the philosophy of Gilbert. However, we should not

fail to give a warning about such philosophies. We already conceive and

foresee that, if ever men take heed of our advice and seriously devote them-

selves to experience (having said goodbye to the sophistic doctrines),

then this philosophy will at last be genuinely dangerous, because of the

mind's premature and precipitate haste, and its leaping or ﬂying to general

statements and the principles of things; even now we should be facing this

problem.

LXV

The corruption of philosophy from superstition and a dash of theology is

much more widely evident, and causes a very great deal of harm either to

entire philosophies or to their parts. For the human mind is no less liable

to the impressions of fantasy than to impressions from common notions.

The disputatious and sophistical kind of philosophy catches the under-

standing in a trap, but the other kind, the fantastic, high-blown, semi-



Book I

poetical philosophy, seduces it. There is in man a kind of ambition of

the intellect no less than of the will, especially in lofty, high-minded

characters.

A conspicuous example of this occurs among the Greeks in Pythagoras,

where it is combined with a rather crass and cumbrous superstition, and in

a more perilous and subtle form in Plato and his school. This kind of evil

also occurs in parts of other philosophies by the introduction of abstract

forms and ﬁnal causes and ﬁrst causes, and by frequent omission of inter-

mediate causes and so on. We must give the strongest warning here. For

the worst thing is the apotheosis of error; respect for foolish notions has to

be regarded as a disease of the intellect. Some of the moderns have, with

extreme frivolity, been so lenient to such foolishness that they have tried to

base natural philosophy on Genesis and the Book of Job and other sacred

Scriptures, seeking the dead among the living.25 This folly needs to be

checked and stiﬂed all the more vigorously because heretical religion as

well as fanciful philosophy derives from the unhealthy mingling of divine

and human. And therefore it is very salutary, in all sobriety, to give to faith

only what belongs to faith.

LXVI

So much for the poor authority of philosophies founded on common notions

or few experiments or superstition. We must next speak of poor material for

reﬂection, especially in natural philosophy. The human mind is misled by

looking at what is done in the mechanical arts, in which bodies are entirely

changed by composition and separation, into supposing that something

similar also happens in the universal nature of things. This is the source of

the ﬁction of the elements and of their collision to form natural bodies.

Again, when a man contemplates the liberty of nature, he comes upon the

species of things - animals, plants and minerals; and from there he slides

easily into the thought that there are in nature certain primary forms of

things, which nature is struggling to bring out, and that all the rest of her

variety comes from the obstacles and errors of nature in completing her

task, or from conﬂict between the diﬀerent species. The ﬁrst thought gave

us the ﬁrst elementary qualities, the second occult properties and speciﬁc

virtues; both notions belong to the category of meaningless summaries of

25 Luke :.



The New Organon

observations, in which the mind acquiesces and is diverted from sounder

ideas. Physicians have more success when they use the secondary qualities

of things and the operations of attraction, repulsion, rarefaction, conden-

sation, dilation, contraction, dissipation, maturation and so on. They

would have made even better progress if from the summary notions I have

spoken of (i.e. elementary qualities and speciﬁc virtues) they did not

corrupt the others (which have been rightly noted), by reducing them to

ﬁrst qualities and subtle, incommensurable mixtures of things, or by not

extending them to third and fourth qualities by further, more careful

observation; they broke oﬀ their observations too early. We should look for

such virtues (I do not say the same but similar) not only in the medicines

for the human body, but also in the factors which modify other natural

bodies.

It is a much more serious problem that they observe and investigate the

principles of things at rest from which things come into being, and not the

moving things through which things come into being. The former relate to

discussion, the latter to results. And there is no value in the usual diﬀerences

of motion noted in traditional natural philosophy – generation, corruption,

growth, decrease, alteration and movement. For this is all they mean: if a body,

otherwise unchanged, moves spatially, this is movement;26 if while place and

species remain the same, it changes in quality, this is alteration; and if as a

result of that change, the mass itself and quantity of the body do not remain

the same, this is the motion of growth and decrease; if they alter to the extent

that they change the very species and substance, and become other things,

that is generation and corruption. But these are merely popular notions, and

do not pierce into the nature at all; and they are measures and periods only,

not species of motion. For they indicate only how far? and not how, or from

what source. They tell us nothing of the appetite of bodies, or of the process

of their parts; they merely guess at a division when a motion shows the

senses in an obvious manner that an object is otherwise than it was before.

And when they want to explain something of the causes of motions, and to

set up a division of them, they introduce a distinction between natural and

violent motion, a supremely idle move, since this distinction comes straight

from the common notion. For every violent motion is in truth also a natural

motion, i.e. when an external cause sets a nature in motion in a diﬀerent

manner than it was in before.

26 latio



Book I

But leave all this aside; if anyone (for the sake of example) has observed

that there is in bodies an appetite for mutual contact, so that they do not

suﬀer the unity of nature to be completely pulled and torn apart, and

thereby have a vacuum; if anyone has observed that there is in bodies an

appetite for withdrawing to their own natural size or tension, so that if they

are compressed or stretched more or less than this, they instantly strive to

recover and retrieve their former sphere and extension; or if anyone has

observed that there is in bodies an appetite to assemble with masses of

things of their own kind, i.e. an appetite in dense things for the earth, of

thin and rare things for the circuit of the sky: these things and things like

them are truly physical kinds of motion. But those others are simply

theoretical and scholastic, as is manifestly clear from this comparison

between them.

It is no less of a problem that in their philosophies and observations they

waste their eﬀorts on investigating and treating the principles of things and

the ultimate causes of nature (ultimatibus naturae), since all utility and

opportunity for application lies in the intermediate causes (in mediis). This

is why men do not cease to abstract nature until they reach potential and

unformed matter, nor again do they cease to dissect nature till they come

to the atom. Even if these things were true, they can do little to improve

men's fortunes.

LXVII

The understanding needs also to be cautioned against the intemperance of

philosophies in giving or refusing assent; such intemperance seems to ﬁx

idols and somehow prolong their life, so that there is no possibility of

getting rid of them.

There are two kinds of excess: one is that of those who readily make pro-

nouncements, and make the sciences lay down the law in a magisterial man-

ner; the other is the excess of those who have introduced lack of conviction

(acatalepsia) and an aimless and endless questioning. The ﬁrst of these

represses the understanding, the second robs it of strength. For after the

philosophy of Aristotle had (in the manner of the Ottomans towards their

brothers) slaughtered the other philosophies with vicious disputations, it

made pronouncements on every single question; and he himself formulates

objections at his own whim, and then deals with them, so that everything

is certain and settled; and this is still the way with his successors.



The New Organon

The school of Plato introduced lack of conviction, at ﬁrst apparently in

jest and irony, from resentment against the old sophists, Protagoras,

Hippias and the others, who feared nothing so much as to be seen to be

hesitating about anything.27 The New Academy made lack of conviction a

dogma, and held it as a tenet.28 It is a more honest method than a licence to

make pronouncements, since they claim for themselves that they do not

subvert inquiry, as Pyrrho and the Ephectici29 did, but have something to

follow as probable, though nothing to hold as true. Nevertheless, after the

human mind has once despaired of ﬁnding truth, everything becomes very

much feebler; and the result is that they turn men aside to agreeable dis-

cussions and discourses, and a kind of ambling around things, rather than

sustain them in the severe path of inquiry. As we have said from the begin-

ning, and constantly maintain, we must not detract from the authority of

the human senses and the human understanding and their deﬁciencies, but

must ﬁnd assistance for them.

LXVIII

So much for the individual kinds of idols and their trappings; all of which

must be rejected and renounced and the mind totally liberated and

cleansed of them, so that there will be only one entrance into the kingdom

of man, which is based upon the sciences, as there is into the kingdom of

heaven, ‘into which, except as an infant, there is no way to enter'.30

LXIX

Bad demonstrations are the defences and fortresses of the idols; and the

demonstrations which we have in dialectic do no more than addict and

enslave the world wholly to human thoughts and thoughts to words.

Demonstrations are, potentially, philosophies and sciences themselves.

For as they are, and as they are well or badly devised, philosophies and

27 This refers to the sceptical side of the Platonic legacy, which arose from the questioning dialectic of

Socrates. Protagoras and Hippias are two of the best-known names of the ﬁfth-century Sophistic

movement; they prided themselves, as teachers of rhetoric, on their ability to speak eloquently and

positively on any question.

became head in the mid second century .

his followers.

reﬂection follow. And the demonstrations which we employ in the univer-

sal process which leads from the senses and things to axioms and con-

clusions fail us and are incompetent. This process has four aspects, and

four faults. First, the impressions of the senses themselves are faulty; for

the senses fail and deceive. There need to be substitutions for the failures

and corrections for the errors. Secondly, notions are poorly abstracted from

sense impressions, and are indeterminate and confused where they should

be determinate and sharply deﬁned. Thirdly, induction is poor if it reaches

the principles of the sciences by simple enumeration without making use

of exclusions and dissolutions, or proper analyses of nature. Finally, the

method of discovery and proof, which ﬁrst sets up the most general

principles, and then compares and tests the intermediate axioms by the

general principles, is the mother of errors and the annihilation of all the

sciences. We are now just touching on these things in passing; we will

discuss them at greater length when we explain the true way of interpret-

ing nature, after we have ﬁnished these cleansings and purgings of the

mind.

LXX

But the best demonstration by far is experience, provided it stays close

to the experience itself. For it is a fallacy to pass on to other things which

are supposed to be similar, unless the inference is made duly and in order.

But the method of experiment31 which men now use is blind and stupid.

Consequently, as they stray and wander in no clear path, just taking their

lead from the things they come across, they go round and about and make

little headway; sometimes elated and sometimes distracted, they are always

ﬁnding something else to go on to. Almost always men take their experi-

ences lightly, as if it were a game, making small variations on experiments

already known; if the thing does not succeed, they get tired of it, and give

up. Even if they take a more serious attitude towards their experiments,

more resolute and prepared for hard work, they still devote their eﬀorts to

revealing some one experience, as Gilbert did with the magnet and the

Chemists with gold. Men act like this because their practice is not merely

frivolous but also unintelligent. No search for the nature of a thing is going

31 Or ‘experience'. Experientia and experimentum are used indiﬀerently by Bacon both for the unforced

observation which we might call experience and for the contrived experience which we might call

an experiment.



The New Organon

to be successful if conﬁned to the thing itself; the inquiry needs to be

widened to include more general issues.

If on the basis of their experiments they do construct some kind of

science and dogmas, still they nearly always give in to a hasty and premature

urge to turn to practical application: not only for the use and proﬁt they

may get from such application, but in order to ﬁnd assurance in the form

of a new result that they will not be wasting their time in their future work,

and also to advertise themselves to others, in order to increase their repu-

tation in the ﬁeld of their activities. The result is that, like Atalanta, they

go out of their way to pick up the golden apple, and interrupt their run-

ning, and let victory slip from their grasp. But in following the true course

of experience and directing it towards new results, we should simply take

the divine wisdom and order as our example. On the ﬁrst day of creation

God made only the light, and devoted the whole day to this work, and made

no material thing that day. We too need ﬁrst to elicit the discovery of true

causes and axioms from every kind of experience: and we must look for

illuminating, not proﬁtable, experiments. Once axioms have been rightly

discovered and rightly formed, they oﬀer massive assistance to practice. We

shall speak later of ways of experiencing which, no less than ways of judge-

ment, have been barred and blocked oﬀ; so far we have only said that

common experience is a poor demonstration. Now the order of things

requires us to say something more about the signs I mentioned earlier,

which indicate that the philosophies and observations now in use are

inadequate, and on the reasons for a thing which is at ﬁrst sight so surpris-

ing and incredible. Notice of the signs encourages assent; explanation of

the reasons removes surprise. These two things greatly assist a swift but

gentle purgation of idols from the understanding.

LXXI

Nearly all the sciences we have come from the Greeks. Additions by

Roman, Arabic or more recent writers are few and of no great signiﬁcance;

such as they are, they rest on a foundation of Greek discovery. However,

the wisdom of the Greeks was rhetorical and prone to disputation, a genus

inimical to the search for truth. And so the term ‘Sophists', which was

rejected by those who wanted to be regarded as philosophers and applied

with contempt to the orators - Gorgias, Protagoras, Hippias, Polus – is

also applicable to the whole tribe - Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus,



Book I

Theophrastus and their successors, Chrysippus, Carneades and the rest.32

The only diﬀerence was that the former were itinerant and mercenary,

travelling around the cities, making a display of their wisdom and requir-

ing fees; the others were more digniﬁed and more liberal, in that they had

ﬁxed abodes, opened schools and taught philosophy without charge. But

(though diﬀerent in other ways) both were rhetorical, and made it a matter

of disputations, and set up philosophical sects and schools, and fought for

them. Consequently, their teachings were more or less what Dionysius

aptly said against Plato - ‘the words of idle old men to callow youths'.33 But

the older Greeks34 - Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippus, Democritus,

Parmenides, Heraclitus, Xenophanes, Philolaus and the others (but not the

superstitious Pythagoras) - did not, so far as we know, open schools, but

gave themselves to the search for truth more quietly, more seriously and

more simply, that is with less aﬀectation and display. And therefore, as we

suppose, they succeeded better, except that their works have been over-

whelmed in the passage of time by those lighter works which are better

suited to please the capacity and taste of the crowd; time (like a river) has

brought down to us the lighter, more inﬂated works and sunk the solid and

weightier. And yet not even they were completely exempt from the typical

vice of their people: they too were too susceptible to the ambition and

vanity of founding a sect and winning popular favour. There is no hope for

the search for truth when it is sidetracked into these trivialities. And we

should not forget, I think, the judgement, or rather prophecy, of an

Egyptian priest about the Greeks: ‘that they were always children, and

had no antiquity of knowledge, nor knowledge of antiquity'.35 They

certainly do have a characteristic of the child: the readiness to talk, with the

inability to produce anything; for their wisdom seems wordy and barren of

works. And therefore the signs that we gather from the birthplace and

family of the philosophy now in use are not good.

32 Gorgias, Protagoras, Hippias and Polus are sophists of the ﬁfth century . The rest are a roll-call

of the great names of Greek philosophy. Zeno founded the Stoic school in the late fourth century,

and Chrysippus, the third head of the school, is its ‘second founder'. Epicurus founded the

Epicurean school in the late fourth century. Theophrastus succeeded Aristotle as head of the

Lyceum. Carneades converted Plato's Academy to Scepticism when he became its head in the mid

second century .

Nor are the signs which can be gathered from the nature of the time

and of the age much better than those from the nature of the place and of

the people. Throughout that period knowledge of time and of the world

was narrow and limited; and that is a very bad thing indeed, especially

for those who stake everything on experience. For they did not have a

thousand-year history that deserved the name of history, but fables and

rumours of antiquity. They knew only a fraction of the parts and regions

of the world, since they called all northern peoples Scythians and all

western peoples Celts indiscriminately, knew nothing in Africa beyond

the nearest part of Ethiopia, nothing of Asia beyond the Ganges, much

less the territories of the New World, even by report or consistent and

believable rumour. In fact most climates and zones, in which uncounted

nations live and breathe, were declared uninhabitable; and the travels of

Democritus, Plato and Pythagoras, which certainly did not take them far

from home, were celebrated as major undertakings. But in our time

large parts of the New World and the farthest parts of the Old are becoming

known everywhere, and the store of experiences has grown immeasurably.

Hence if (like astrologers) we are to gather signs from the time of nativity

or conception, nothing signiﬁcant seems to be forecast for those

philosophies.

LXXIII

None of the signs is more certain or more worth noticing than that from

products. For the discovery of products and results is like a warranty or

guarantee of the truth of a philosophy. From these Greek philosophies and

the specialised sciences derived from them, hardly a single experience can

be cited after the passage of so many years which tends to ease and improve

the human condition, and which can be truly credited to the doctrines of

the philosophy. Celsus admits it frankly and sensibly: ﬁrst the experiences

of medicine were discovered, and then men philosophised about them and

sought and assigned causes; it did not happen the other way round, that the

experiences were discovered or suggested by philosophy and a knowledge

of causes. And so it was no wonder that there were more images of animals

than of men among the Egyptians (the Egyptians gave divinity and deiﬁca-

tion to inventors of things); the reason was that animals have made many



Book I

discoveries by natural instinct, whereas men have little or none to show as

the result of disputation and rational deduction.

But the hard work of the chemists had some results, though more or less

by chance and incidentally, or by some variation of the experiments (such

as mechanics make), not on the basis of an art or theory; for the ﬁctions they

have produced confuse rather than assist experiments. There are few dis-

coveries from those who have worked in so-called natural magic, and they

are slight and more like imposture. In religion we are taught that faith is

shown by works; and the same principle is well applied to a philosophy, that

it be judged by its fruits and, if sterile, held useless; the more so if instead

of the fruits of the vine and the olive, it produces the thistles and thorns of

disputes and controversy.

LXXIV

Signs should also be gathered from the growth and progress of philoso-

phies and sciences. Those that are founded in nature grow and increase;

those founded in opinion change but do not grow. Hence if those doctrines

were not completely uprooted like a plant, but were connected to the womb

of nature and nourished by her, what we see has been happening now for

two thousand years would not have happened: the sciences stand still in

their own footsteps and remain in practically the same state; they have

made no notable progress; in fact they reached their peak in their earliest

author, and have been on the decline ever since. We see the opposite

evolution in the mechanical arts, which are founded in nature and the light

of experience; as long as they are in fashion, they constantly quicken and

grow as if ﬁlled with spirit; at ﬁrst crude, then adequate, later reﬁned, and

always progressing.

LXXV

There is another sign also that we should notice (if the term ‘sign' properly

belongs to it, since it is rather testimony, indeed the most convincing

testimony of all); it is the actual confession of the authors whom men now

follow. For even those who pronounce on things with such conﬁdence

still from time to time, when they come down to earth, resort to complaints

about the subtlety of nature, the obscurity of things and the weakness

of human understanding. If this was all they did, it might perhaps deter



The New Organon

some timid minds from further inquiry, and stimulate and incite men of

a sharper and more conﬁdent turn of mind to further progress. But it is

not enough for them to confess for themselves, but they regard everything

that is unknown or untouched by themselves or their masters as beyond

the bounds of the possible, and declare, on the authority of their art, that it

is impossible for it to be known or done; and so, with supreme arrogance,

they turn the weakness of their own discoveries into an insult against

nature itself and a vote of non-conﬁdence in other men. Hence the school

of the New Academy, which maintained a profession of lack of conviction

(acatalepsia),36 and condemned men to eternal darkness. Hence the

opinion that Forms or the true diﬀerences of things (which are in truth the

laws of pure act) are impossible to discover and are beyond man. Hence

those opinions in the active and operative part of science: that the heat of

the sun and the heat of ﬁre are totally diﬀerent; the fear is of course

that men would imagine that through the operations of ﬁre they could

extract and form something similar to things that exist in nature. Hence

the view that mere composition is a work of man, but mixture is the work

of nature alone: in case men should expect from art the generation or

transformation of natural bodies. And therefore men will easily allow

themselves to be persuaded by this sign not to involve their labours and

their fortunes in tenets which are not merely desperate but doomed to

despair.

LXXVI

Here is another sign that we must not forget, that there has been so

much disagreement among philosophers and such a variety of schools.

This reveals clearly enough that the road from the senses to the intellect

has not been well built, since the same material of philosophy (namely

the nature of things) has been taken and used to construct so many

paths of error. And though in our time disagreements and diﬀerences

of opinion about actual principles and systematic philosophies have

been all but extinguished, there still remain countless questions and

controversies about the parts of philosophy; thus it is obvious that there is

nothing certain or sound in the philosophies themselves or in the modes of

demonstration.

36 See .n.



LXXVII

A view exists that there is at least a great consensus around the philosophy

of Aristotle, since after its publication the philosophies of the older

philosophers allegedly fell into disuse and were forgotten, and in the later

period nothing better was discovered; so that it seems to have been so well

founded and so well established that it monopolised both periods. But ﬁrst,

the common view of the neglect of ancient philosophy after the publication

of the works of Aristotle is not true; long afterwards right down to the time

of Cicero and the following centuries the works of the older philosophers

survived. It was only in subsequent centuries, when human learning

suﬀered shipwreck, so to speak, from the ﬂood of barbarians that poured

into the Roman empire, that the philosophies of Aristotle and Plato were

saved by ﬂoating on the waves of the times like planks of rather lighter, less

solid material. The matter of consensus also is deceptive if one takes a

closer look at it. A true consensus is one which (after examination of the

matter) consists in liberty of judgement converging on the same point. But

the great majority of those who have accepted the philosophy of Aristotle

have enslaved themselves to it from prejudice and the authority of others;

so that it is rather discipleship and party unity than a consensus. Even if it

had been a true, widespread consensus, so mistaken is it that a consensus

should be taken for true and sound authority that it implies a strong

presumption to the contrary. Worst of all is to take an indication from

consensus in intellectual matters, except in divine matters and political

matters, where there is a right to vote. For nothing pleases a large number

of people unless it strikes the imagination, or conﬁnes the mind in the

coils of common notions, as was said above. So it is very appropriate to

apply Phocion's remark about morals to intellectual matters: men should

immediately ask themselves seriously what errors or mistakes they have

made if the crowd agrees and applauds.37 This sign therefore is among

the most dangerous. And now we have completed our explanation that

the signs of truth and soundness in the philosophies and sciences, as they

are now, are poor, whether we gather them from their origins, from their

products, from their progress, from their authors' own admissions or from

consensus.

And now we must come to the causes of errors, and the reasons why men

have so persistently stuck to them through so many centuries. These causes

are many and immensely powerful, so that no one should be surprised that

our new approach should have escaped men's notice and remained hidden

until now, but rather that they could now at last occur to a man or enter

someone's mind. Which is the result more of a kind of good fortune than

of any intellectual excellence, and should rather be regarded as a birth of

time than an oﬀspring of intelligence.

For, ﬁrst, if you look at the matter properly, this large number of

centuries is reduced to some very short stretches. Of twenty-ﬁve centuries

in which human memory and learning is more or less in evidence, scarcely

six can be picked out and isolated as fertile in sciences or favourable to their

progress. There are deserts and wastes of time no less than of regions. We

can only count three periods which were high points of learning: one

among the Greeks; a second among the Romans; the last among us, the

western nations of Europe; and barely two centuries can properly be given

to each of them. The middle times of the world were unsuccessful in

producing a large or rich crop of sciences. And there is no reason to

mention the Arabs or the scholastics, whose numerous treatises in the

intervening years rather wore the sciences down than increased their

weight. Thus the ﬁrst reason for such pathetically small progress in the

sciences is rightly and properly ascribed to the small amounts of time that

have favoured them.

LXXIX

In second place we ﬁnd a reason which is certainly of great importance

throughout, namely that in the periods when human intelligence and

letters ﬂourished to a high or even modest degree, natural philosophy

occupied a very small part of their eﬀorts. Yet natural philosophy has to be

regarded as the great mother of the sciences. For all arts and sciences, torn

from this root, may perhaps be polished and fashioned for practical use;

but absolutely do not grow. It is clear that after the Christian faith was

accepted and grew strong, most of the outstanding intellects applied them-

selves to theology; and the greatest prizes were oﬀered for this subject,

and aids of every kind were copiously provided. This zeal for theology



Book I

particularly occupied the third part or period of time among us Western

Europeans; all the more so as at about the same time letters began to

ﬂourish and religious controversies multiplied. In the previous age, while

our second period lasted, the period of the Romans, the dominant concerns

and labours of the philosophers were engaged and absorbed in moral

philosophy (which took the place of theology for the pagans). Also in those

times the greatest minds applied themselves for the most part to politics,

because of the greatness of the Roman empire, which needed the services

of very large numbers of men. The age in which natural philosophy seemed

to ﬂourish most among the Greeks was not a great stretch of time, since in

the early period the so-called Seven Sages all (except Thales) devoted

themselves to moral philosophy and politics; and in the later period, after

Socrates had brought philosophy down from heaven to earth, moral

philosophy grew still stronger, and turned men's minds away from natural

philosophy.

And the very period of time in which the investigation of nature ﬂourished

was spoiled and rendered useless by verbal disputes and rivalry in making

new dogmas. Thus through these three periods natural philosophy was

neglected or obstructed to a pretty large extent, so it is no wonder if men

made little progress in the subject, as they were doing something quite

diﬀerent.

LXXX

The next reason is that natural philosophy has scarcely found, even among

those who have practised it, anyone to devote his whole time to it, especially

in recent times, unless perhaps one might give the example of a monk in

his cell or a nobleman at his place in the country ‘burning the midnight oil'.

Natural philosophy has in fact been treated as a kind of passage or bridge

to other things.

That great mother of the sciences with wonderful indignity has been

pressed to perform the services of a maid, to minister to the needs of medi-

cine or mathematics, or to wash the immature minds of the young and

impregnate them with a kind of ﬁrst dye, so that later they may absorb some

other tincture with greater ease and success. In any case no one should expect

great progress in the sciences (especially in their practical part) unless

natural philosophy is extended to the particular sciences, and the particular

sciences in turn brought back to natural philosophy. This is why astronomy,



The New Organon

optics, music, most of the mechanical arts and medicine itself, also (and per-

haps more surprisingly) moral and civil philosophy and the sciences of logic,

do not reach down to the bottom of things, but simply glide over the variety

of things on the surface. For after they have been divided and constituted as

particular sciences, they are no longer fed by natural philosophy, which could

have lent them new strength and increase from the source, and from true

observations of motions, rays and sounds, of the texture and structure of

bodies, and of the passions and intellectual processes. It is no wonder that the

sciences do not grow when they are cut oﬀ from their roots.

LXXXI

And now another important and powerful reason why the sciences have

made little progress reveals itself. It is this: it is not possible to get around

a racecourse properly if the ﬁnishing line is not properly set and ﬁxed. The

true and legitimate goal of the sciences is to endow human life with new

discoveries and resources. The overwhelming majority of ordinary people

have no notion of this, and are concerned only with wages and professional

matters; perhaps, occasionally, some unusually intelligent craftsman, seek-

ing to achieve a reputation, devotes himself to making some new invention,

usually at his own expense. But in most cases men are so far from setting

themselves to augment the sum of sciences and skills that they neither

take nor seek more from the sum available than what they can turn to

professional use, proﬁt, reputation or similar advantage. And if from so

many there is someone who pursues knowledge with genuine love and for

its own sake, even he will be found to be pursuing a whole variety of

thoughts and doctrines rather than a strict, undeviating investigation of

truth. And if there is another perhaps who is a stricter investigator of truth,

yet he too will set before himself an account of truth which will satisfy the

mind and understanding in providing causes for things already known, not

one which will bring results and the new light of axioms. And thus if no

one has yet properly set out the end of the sciences, it is no wonder that the

consequence in matters subordinate to the end is constant error.

LXXXII

Now just as the end and goal of the sciences is poorly deﬁned among men,

so also even if it had been well deﬁned, yet the road which men have



Book I

chosen for themselves is totally erroneous and impassable. It would strike

the mind dumb with amazement, if one thought about it properly, that it

has been no one's care or concern that a regular, well-built road should be

opened and constructed for the human understanding from sense and

experience; but everything has been left to the darkness of traditions, or to

the eddy and whirl38 of arguments, or to the waves and windings of chance

and casual, unregulated experience. Let anyone think soberly and carefully

about the kind of path men have commonly used in the investigation

and discovery of anything. And ﬁrst he will surely note the simple, non-

scientiﬁc method of discovery which is most familiar to men. This is

simply that in preparing and equipping himself to ﬁnd something out, any-

one ﬁrst researches and reads what others have written on the subject; then

adds his own thoughts, and with much mental agitation interrogates his

own spirit and calls upon it to open its oracles to him. This procedure has

absolutely no foundation and simply spins around on opinions.

Another person, to aid discovery, might call logic in, which belongs to

the subject under discussion only as far as its name is concerned. For a dis-

covery of logic is not a discovery of the leading principles and axioms in

which the arts consist, but only of those which seem to be in agreement

with them. For the more inquisitive and insistent questioners, those who

take the trouble to accost her with demands for proofs and discoveries of

principles or of the ﬁrst axioms, are met by logic with a very well-known

response which throws them back on faith and the oath of allegiance (so to

speak) which anyone must give to any art.

There remains mere experience: which is chance, if it comes by itself;

experiment, if sought. This kind of experience is like a brush without a

head (as they say), mere groping, such as men use in the dark, trying every-

thing in case they may be lucky enough to stumble into the right path. It

would be much better and more sensible to wait for day or light a lamp,

and then to start the journey. The true order of experience, on the other

hand, ﬁrst lights the lamp, then shows the way by its light, beginning with

experience digested and ordered, not backwards or random, and from that

it infers axioms, and then new experiments on the basis of the axioms so

formed; since even the divine word did not operate on the mass of things

without order.

Therefore let men cease to wonder that the sciences have not ﬁnished

38 ‘eddy and whirl' (Kitchin)



The New Organon

the course, since they have wholly lost their way; they have altogether

deserted and abandoned experience, or trapped themselves in it (as in a

maze) and gone round in circles; since a properly organised order takes one

through the woods of experience by a steady path to the open country of

axioms.

LXXXIII

The problem has been wonderfully compounded by a certain opinion or

judgement, which is deeply ingrained but arrogant and harmful, namely

that the majesty of the human mind is diminished if it is too long and too

deeply involved with experiments, and with particular things which are

subject to the senses and bounded by matter: especially as such things

tend to be laborious to investigate, ignoble to think about, crude to speak

of, illiberal in practice, inﬁnite in number and short on subtlety. And so it

has come at last to this, that the true road is not only deserted but also

barred and closed oﬀ; experience is badly managed, or despised and even

abandoned.

LXXXIV

Again, men have been hindered from making progress in the sciences by

the spell (I may say) of reverence for antiquity, and by the authority of men

who have a great reputation in philosophy and by the consensus which

derives from them. I have spoken above of consensus.39

But for antiquity, the opinion which men cherish of it is quite careless,

and barely suits the meaning of the word. For true antiquity should mean

the oldness and great age of the world, which should be attributed to our

times, not to a younger period of the world such as the time of the ancients.

True, that age is ancient and older in relation to us, but with respect to the

world itself, it was new and younger. We expect from an old man greater

knowledge of things human and a more mature judgement than from a

young man, both because of his experience and because of the store and

variety of things which he has seen and heard and thought about. And truly

in the same way it is reasonable that greater things be expected from our

age than from old times (if it only knew its strength and was willing to try

39 See ..



Book I

it and exert it); seeing that our age is the older age of the world, enriched

and stocked with countless experiences and observations.

We should also take into account that many things in nature have come

to light and been discovered as a result of long voyages and travels (which

have been more frequent in our time), and they are capable of shedding new

light in philosophy. Indeed it would be a disgrace to mankind if wide areas

of the physical globe, of land, sea and stars, have been opened up and

explored in our time while the boundaries of the intellectual globe were

conﬁned to the discoveries and narrow limits of the ancients.

With regard to authors, it is a mark of supreme cowardice to give un-

limited credit to authors and to deny its rights to Time, the author of

authors and thus of all authority. For truth is rightly called the daughter

of time and not of authority.40 Therefore it is no wonder if the spell of

antiquity, of authors and of consent has so shackled men's courage that (as

if bewitched) they have been unable to get close to things themselves.

LXXXV

It is not only admiration for antiquity, authority and consensus which has

compelled men's eﬀorts to remain content with things which have already

been discovered; but also admiration for the abundance of actual works

which have already been provided for the human race. When a man sets

before his eyes the variety of objects and the splendid equipment which the

mechanical arts have assembled and contributed to human civilisation, he

will certainly be more disposed to admire man's wealth than to feel for his

poverty; not noticing that men's earliest observations and the operations of

nature (which are like the soul and ﬁrst stirrings of all that variety) are

neither many nor profound, and that the rest is due simply to patience and

the subtle, ordered movement of hand and tool. The construction of clocks

(for example) is certainly a subtle and precise thing that seems to imitate

the celestial bodies in its wheels, and the heartbeat of animals in its

constant, ordered motion; and yet it depends upon just one or two axioms

of nature.

40 Bacon presumably saw the inscription Veritas temporis ﬁlia (Truth the daughter of time) on the groats

of Queen Mary (–). The phrase is also available at Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, ..

(References from Thomas Fowler (ed.), Bacon's Novum Organum, edited with introduction, notes

etc. by Thomas Fowler (Oxford, Clarendon Press, ). The present translation was made from

this edition, which is a critical edition of Bacon's original text published in .)



The New Organon

Again, one might contemplate the subtlety which belongs to the liberal

arts, or that involved in the preparation of natural bodies by the mechanical

arts, and wonder at such things as the discovery of celestial motions in

astronomy, of harmonies in music, of the letters of the alphabet in grammar

(not yet in use even now in the kingdom of China); or, again in mechanics,

the discovery of the products of Bacchus and Ceres, that is, the making of

wine and beer, loaves of bread, or the delicacies of the table and distillation,

and so on. One might reﬂect and notice how many centuries it took for

these things to be brought to the state of development which we now enjoy,

since all of them, except distillation, were ancient, and (as we said of clocks)

how little they owe to observations and axioms of nature, and how easily,

by ready opportunities and casual observations, they have been discovered.

And thus, I say, he will easily free himself from all wonder, and rather pity

the human condition, that through so many centuries there has been such

a lack, such a dearth of objects and discoveries. And these discoveries which

we have just mentioned are older than philosophy and the arts of under-

standing, so that (if the truth be told) since such rational and dogmatic

sciences came into being, the discovery of useful works has ceased.

Anyone who has turned his attention from workshops to libraries and

conceived an admiration for the immense variety of books we see around

us will surely experience a stupendous change of mind once he has given

the matter and content of the books themselves a careful examination and

inspection. Having observed that there is no end to repetitions, and how

men keep on doing and saying the same things, he will pass from admira-

tion of variety to amazement at the poverty and paucity of the things which

until now have held and occupied the minds of men.

Anyone who lowers himself to contemplate those matters which are

thought to be more curious than sensible, and looks deeply into the works

of alchemists and magicians, will perhaps be unsure whether they more

deserve laughter or tears. The alchemist cherishes an eternal hope, and

when a thing does not succeed, he holds his own mistakes responsible. He

accuses himself of not properly understanding the words of the art or of the

authors, and so proceeds to give his attention to traditions and underground

reports; or of making a slip in the weights or timing of his procedure, and

so proceeds to repeat the experiment indeﬁnitely; and in the meantime

when among the hazards of his experiments he chances upon something

new in appearance or usefully worth saving; he feeds his spirit on such

promises, and exaggerates and advertises them: for the rest he lives in hope.



Book I

And yet it must not be denied that alchemists have discovered quite a few

things, and given men useful discoveries. They ﬁt quite well in the story

of the old man who left his daughters some gold buried in a vineyard and

pretended not to know the exact spot; as a result of which they set them-

selves to dig diligently in that vineyard; and no gold was found, but the

harvest was richer for the cultivation.

But the devotees of natural magic, who deal with everything by the sym-

pathies and antipathies of things, have ascribed wonderful powers and

eﬀects to things on the basis of idle, lazy conjectures; and any results they

have shown are good only for surprise and novelty, not proﬁt and usefulness.

In superstitious magic (if we must speak of this too) we should particu-

larly notice that among all nations and religions in all times, it is only in

subjects of a certain limited kind that the curious and superstitious arts

have done, or seem to have done, anything; so let us dismiss them. To sum

up, it is not surprising that our belief that we have a lot has been a cause of

our having so little.

LXXXVI

Men's wonder at learning and the arts, which is simple enough in itself and

almost like the wonder of children, has been reinforced by the cunning and

artiﬁce of those who have practised and taught the sciences. They bring

them forward with much show and aﬀectation, and put them before the

public in a misleading and disguised fashion, in order to give the impres-

sion that they are quite ﬁnished and honed to the last degree of perfection.

For if you look at their method and their divisions, they appear to embrace

and include absolutely everything that can come under that subject. True,

the subdivisions are empty, like bookshelves without books, but to the

common mind they have the form and organisation of a complete science.

But the earliest and most ancient investigators of truth, with better credit

and success,41 used to cast the knowledge which they set themselves to

gather from the contemplation of things and to store for use, into the form

of aphorisms, or short, unconnected sentences, not methodically arranged;

and did not pretend or profess to possess a universal art. But as things are

done now, it is no wonder at all if men do not look any further into subjects

that are taught as complete and long perfected in all their parts.

The New Organon

LXXXVII

The old ideas have also received a big boost to their reputation and credit

from the slick and empty claims made by supporters of the new, especially

in the practical and applied part of natural philosophy. There have been

plenty of glib, fanciful talkers who have showered the human race with

promises, partly from credulity and partly from imposture: promising and

advertising longer life, postponement of old age, relief from pain, healing

of natural defects, temptations for the senses, enchantment and excitement

of the passions, stimulation and enlightenment of the intellectual faculties,

transmutation of substances, unlimited power and variety of movement,

impressions and alterations of air, drawing and control of celestial inﬂu-

ences, divination of future things, representation of distant things, revela-

tion of hidden things and much more of the same. The right verdict on

these false benefactors is that in philosophical teaching there is just as much

diﬀerence between their empty promises and the true arts as there is, in the

narratives of history, between the achievements of Julius Caesar or

Alexander the Great and the deeds of Amadis of Gaul or Arthur of Britain.42

Those famous generals are found to have actually done greater things

than those ﬁctitious heroes are even feigned to have done; and in ways and

manners of action which are not at all fabulous and marvellous. Nor is it

reasonable that the credit of true memory should be diminished because it

has sometimes been damaged and violated by fables. But in any case it is no

wonder that the impostors who have tried such things have raised a great

prejudice against new proposals (especially when they are said to have

practical eﬀects), since their excessive vanity and contempt even in our day

has destroyed all belief in eﬀorts of that kind.

LXXXVIII

Much greater harm has been done to the sciences by lack of ambition and

by the pettiness and poverty of the projects that human industry has set

itself. And, worst of all, this lack of ambition is accompanied by arrogance

and contempt.

42 Julius Caesar (?– ), Roman politician, general and dictator, conqueror of Gaul. Alexander

of Macedon (– ), conqueror of the Persian empire. Amadis of Gaul, ﬁctional hero of the

medieval romance of that name, which was popular down to Bacon's own time. Arthur of Britain:

legendary hero of the Arthurian cycle of stories.



Book I

First there is the excuse that has become familiar in all the arts whereby

authors turn the feebleness of their art into a false accusation against

nature; and what their art fails to achieve, they declare, on the basis of the

same art, to be impossible in nature. And certainly an art cannot be con-

demned if it is its own judge. Even the philosophy which is now current

cherishes some positions or doctrines in its bosom which (if you look care-

fully) they want everyone to accept without question: that nothing should

be expected from art or the work of man which is diﬃcult or masterful or

strong against nature; as we said above about the diﬀerence in kind between

the heat of a star and the heat of ﬁre, and about mixture. If you look at it

carefully, this is wholly due to a wilful limiting of human power, and to an

artiﬁcially manufactured desperation, which not only dims any visions of

hope, but also blights all the incentives and nerves of industry, and rejects

the hazards of experience itself. They only care that their art should be

thought to be perfect; and they make the vainest and most damaging

pretense that whatever has not yet been discovered and understood cannot

be expected to be found or understood in the future. If however someone

does try to devote himself to things and to ﬁnd something new, he will

simply decide to set himself to make a thorough and detailed investigation

of some one discovery (and no more): the nature of the magnet, for example,

the ebb and ﬂow of the tides, the system of the sky, and so on, which seem

to hold some secret and so far have been treated with little success. It is a

mark of the highest incompetence to make a thorough investigation of the

nature of some one thing by itself, seeing that the same nature which seems

to be latent and hidden in some things is manifest and graspable in others,

and is a cause of wonder in the ﬁrst case but in the latter does not even draw

attention. This is the case with the nature of consistency, which in wood

or rock is not particularly noted but casually referred to as solid, without

further inquiry about their refusal of separation or dissolution of their

continuity; but in the case of bubbles of water the same thing seems to be

subtle and ingenious, because they wrap themselves in little ﬁlms, curiously

shaped in the form of a hemisphere, so that for a moment of time they avoid

dissolution of their continuity.

Moreover, even things which are thought to be secret have an open and

public nature in other cases; which will never allow itself to be seen, if

men's experiments or thoughts are only concerned with the things them-

selves. And it is generally and commonly taken to be a new discovery in

mechanical eﬀects if one puts a subtler ﬁnish on things discovered long



The New Organon

before or dresses them out more elegantly, or puts things together and

uniﬁes them, or ties them more conveniently to their use, or presents an

eﬀect with a greater or even a smaller amount or volume than it was

accustomed to have, and so on.

Therefore it is no wonder that no remarkable discoveries worthy of the

human race have been brought into the light, since men have been happy

and content with such little, childish tasks; and in fact have supposed that

in them they were pursuing or achieving something important.

LXXXIX

Nor should we fail to mention that in every age natural philosophy has had

a troublesome and diﬃcult adversary, namely superstition and the blind,

immoderate zeal of religion. One may see among the Greeks that those who

ﬁrst proposed natural explanations for lightning and storms to men who

had never heard of such a thing were found guilty of impiety against the

gods. Not much better treatment was given by some of the ancient fathers

of the Christian religion to those who on the basis of most evident proofs

(which today no sane man would contradict) took the position that the

earth is round, and in consequence asserted that the antipodes exist.

Furthermore, as things are now, the situation for discussions of nature

has been made much harder and more dangerous by the Summaries and

Methodical Treatises of the scholastic theologians, who when they reduced

theology to order (as much as they could) and fashioned it in the form of

an art, also succeeded in mixing the prickly and contentious philosophy of

Aristotle more thoroughly into the body of religion than was appropriate.

The same tendency is shown (though in a diﬀerent manner) by the

treatises of those who have not been afraid to deduce and conﬁrm the truth

of the Christian religion from the principles and authority of philosophers.

With much pomp and ceremony they celebrate the marriage of faith and

sense as a legitimate union, and charm men's minds with a pleasing

variety of things, but at the same time mix things human with things divine,

an unequal union. Such mixtures of theology and philosophy ﬁnd room

only for what is currently acceptable in philosophy; new things, though a

change for the better, are all but dismissed and excluded.

Finally you will ﬁnd that some theologians in their ignorance completely

block access to any philosophy, however much emended. Some are simply

anxious that a closer investigation of nature may penetrate beyond the



Book I

permitted boundaries of sound opinion; they misinterpret what the holy

Scriptures, in talking of divine mysteries, have to say against prying into

God's secrets, and wrongly apply it to the hidden things of nature, which

are not forbidden by any prohibition. Others, more cunningly, conjecture

and imagine that if the intermediate causes of things are unknown,

individual events can more easily be attributed to the hand and rod of God

(which is, as they suppose, very much in the interest of religion); this is

simply an attempt ‘to please God by a lie'.43 Others fear from example that

movements and changes in philosophy will invade religion and settle

there. Others, ﬁnally, seem anxious that something might be found in the

investigation of nature which would undermine or at least weaken religion

(especially among the uneducated). These two latter fears seem to us to

smell too much of carnal wisdom, as if men had no conﬁdence and felt

doubt in the depths of their mind and in their secret thoughts about the

strength of religion and the dominion of faith over the senses; and were

therefore afraid and felt threatened by the investigation of truth in natural

matters. But truly, if one thinks about it, natural philosophy, after the word

of God, is the strongest remedy for superstition and the most proven food

of faith. Therefore it has deservedly been granted to religion as its most

faithful handmaid; for one manifests the will of God, the other his power.

He was not mistaken who said: ‘ye do err, not knowing the scriptures and

the power of God',44 mixing and uniting the revelation of his will and the

thought of his power in an indivisible bond. No wonder the growth of

natural philosophy has been inhibited, since religion, which has the most

enormous power over men's minds, has been kidnapped by the ignorance

and reckless zeal of certain persons, and made to join the side of the enemy.

XC

Again, in the manners and customs of the schools, universities, colleges and

similar institutions, which are intended to house scholars and cultivate

learning, everything is found to be inimical to the progress of the sciences.

For the readings and exercises are so designed that it would hardly occur

to anyone to think or consider anything out of the ordinary. And if perhaps

someone should have the courage to use his liberty of judgement, he would

be taking the task on himself alone; he will get no useful help from his

43 Cf. Job :.

44 Matthew :.



The New Organon

colleagues. And if he puts up with this too, he will ﬁnd that in pursuing

his career his industry and largeness of view will be no small obstacle to

him. For men's studies in such places are conﬁned and imprisoned in the

writings of certain authors; anyone who disagrees with them is instantly

attacked as a troublemaker and revolutionary. But there is certainly a great

diﬀerence between political matters and the arts: there is not the same

danger from a new movement and a new light. In political matters even a

change for the better is suspected as subversive, since politics rests upon

authority, consent, reputation and opinion, not on demonstration. But in

the arts and sciences, as in a mine, everything should hum with new works

and further progress. This is how things are according to right reason, but

it is not how things actually are; the administration and policy towards

learning which we have discussed has long had a gravely suppressive eﬀect

on the advancement of the sciences.

XCI

Furthermore, even if this jealous opposition stopped, it is still enough

to check the growth of the sciences that such eﬀorts and labours are with-

out reward. For the cultivation of the sciences and reward are not in the

same hands. For the growth of the sciences comes inevitably from great

intellects; but the prizes and rewards of the sciences are in the hands of

the vulgar or of princes, who (with very rare exceptions) are barely even

moderately learned. In fact such advances fail to obtain not only rewards

and goodwill from men but even popular praise. For they are beyond the

understanding of the majority of men, and are easily overwhelmed and

extinguished by the winds of popular opinion. No wonder that a thing

which has not been honoured has not prospered.

XCII

But much the greatest obstacle to the progress of the sciences and to open-

ing up new tasks and provinces within them lies in men's lack of hope and

in the assumption that it is impossible. For grave and prudent men tend to

be quite without conﬁdence in such things, reﬂecting in themselves on the

obscurity of nature, the shortness of life, the defects of the senses, the weak-

ness of judgement, the diﬃculties of experiments, and so on. And so they

suppose that there is a kind of ebb and ﬂow of knowledge, through the



Book I

turnings of time and the ages of the world; since in some periods they grow

and ﬂourish, in others decline and fall: and always under this law, that when

they have reached a certain level and condition, they can go no further.

Therefore, if anyone believes or promises more, they think it is a sign of

an immoderate and immature mind; and believe that in such eﬀorts the

beginning is happy, the middle is diﬃcult and the end confusion. And since

such thoughts are those which readily occur to serious men of superior

judgement, we must truly be careful not to be captivated by our love for the

best and most beautiful thing, and relax or lessen the severity of our judge-

ment. We must carefully consider what hope appears and from what direc-

tion it comes; we must reject the lighter breezes of hope, and thoroughly

analyse and weigh those which seem most sound. We also need to call in

political prudence to give advice, and we must make use of it; it is distrust-

ful by its nature, and takes a dim view of human aﬀairs. And so we must

now speak of hope; especially as we do not make rash promises nor do

violence to men's judgments, nor lay snares for them, but lead them by the

hand and with their own consent. By far the most powerful remedy for

impressing hope would be to lead men to particulars, especially as digested

and arranged in our tables of discovery (these belong partly to the Second

but mostly to the Fourth Part of our Renewal), since this is not mere hope

but the thing itself. Yet to do all gently, we must proceed in our plan of

preparing men's minds; and the display of hope is no small part of that

preparation. For without hope, the rest of it tends to make men sad (i.e. it

gives men a worse and lower opinion than they had of things as they are

now, and sharpens their perceptions and feelings about the poverty of their

condition) rather than lend them any eagerness or sharpen their keenness

to experiment. And therefore we should reveal and publish our conjec-

tures, which make it reasonable to have hope: just as Columbus did, before

his wonderful voyage across the Atlantic Sea, when he gave reasons why

he was conﬁdent that new lands and continents, beyond those previously

known, could be found; reasons which were at ﬁrst rejected but were after-

wards proven by experience, and have been the causes and beginnings of

great things.

XCIII

We must begin from God, since our work, because of the supreme element

of good in it, is manifestly from God, who is the author of good and the



The New Organon

father of lights.45 And in the operations of God, the beginnings, however

slender, have a sure end. What is said of spiritual things, ‘the kingdom of

God does not come with watching'46 is also found to be true in all the

greater works of providence; so that all things move smoothly without

sound or commotion, and the thing is wholly done before men realise or

notice that it is under way. Nor should we omit the prophecy of Daniel on

the last times of the world: ‘Many shall pass through, and knowledge will

be increased',47 which obviously signiﬁes enigmatically that it is in the

fates, that is, in providence, that the circumnavigation of the world (which

after so many long voyages now seems quite complete or on the way to

completion) and the increase of the sciences should come to pass in the

same age.

XCIV

Now comes the reason which most of all gives grounds for hope: namely

from the errors of past times and of the ways so far tried. There is a very

ﬁne reproach about the poor handling of a political situation which some-

one expressed in these words: ‘What is worst in the past should seem the

best for the future. For if you had done everything which belongs to your

duty, and your aﬀairs were in no better shape, there would be no hope left

that they could take a turn for the better. But since your aﬀairs are bad, not

through force of the situation but by your own mistakes, it is to be hoped

that when those mistakes are put aside or corrected, a great change for the

better may be made in your aﬀairs'.48 In a similar way, if through so many

periods of years men had kept to the true way of discovering and develop-

ing the sciences, and had not been able to progress further than they have,

it would certainly be a bold and rash opinion that the thing could advance

any further. But if they had mistaken the way, and men's eﬀorts were spent

on things on which they should not have been spent, it follows that the

source of the diﬃculty is not in the things themselves, which are not in our

power, but in the human understanding, and its use and application; and

that is susceptible of remedy and cure. Therefore the best thing would be

to set out these errors: for every error that has been an obstacle in the past

Book I

is an argument of hope for the future. Though these obstacles have been

lightly touched on in what we said above, still it has also seemed good to

present them brieﬂy now in plain and simple words.

XCV

Those who have treated of the sciences have been either empiricists or

dogmatists. Empiricists, like ants, simply accumulate and use; Rationalists,

like spiders, spin webs from themselves; the way of the bee is in between:

it takes material from the ﬂowers of the garden and the ﬁeld; but it has the

ability to convert and digest them. This is not unlike the true working of

philosophy; which does not rely solely or mainly on mental power, and

does not store the material provided by natural history and mechanical

experiments in its memory untouched but altered and adapted in the

intellect. Therefore much is to be hoped from a closer and more binding

alliance (which has never yet been made) between these faculties (i.e. the

experimental and the rational).

XCVI

Natural philosophy is not yet found in a pure state, but contaminated and

corrupted: in the school of Aristotle by logic, in the school of Plato by

natural theology; in Plato's second school, that of Proclus and others, by

mathematics, which should only give limits to natural philosophy, not

generate or beget it. Better things are to be hoped from natural philosophy

pure and unadulterated.

XCVII

There is no one yet found of such constancy and intellectual rigour that he

has deliberately set himself to do completely without common theories

and common notions, and apply afresh to particulars a scoured and level

intellect. And thus the human reason which we now have is a heap of

jumble built up from many beliefs and many stray events as well as from

childish notions which we absorbed in our earliest years.

But if someone of mature age, with faculties unimpaired and mind

cleansed of prejudice, applies himself afresh to experience and particulars,

better is to be hoped of him. And in this task we promise ourselves the



The New Organon

fortune of Alexander the Great; and let no one accuse us of vanity before

he sees the result of the thing, which aims to uproot all vanity.

For of Alexander and his achievement Aeschines spoke as follows: ‘we

certainly do not live a mortal life; but we were born for this, that posterity

should say and proclaim marvels of us':49 exactly as if he regarded

Alexander's achievements as miraculous.

In later times Titus Livy considered the matter and saw more deeply into

it, and spoke somewhat as follows about Alexander:50 ‘that he simply had

the courage to despise vanities'. And we think that the same judgement will

be made of us in future times: ‘that we did nothing great, but simply put

less value on things which are held to be great'. But meanwhile (as we have

said already) there is no hope except in the renewal of the sciences, i.e. that

they may be raised up in a sure order from experience and founded anew;

which no one (we think) would aﬃrm has yet been done or contemplated.

XCVIII

The foundations of experience (since we absolutely must get down to this)

have been non-existent or very weak; nor has a collection or store of

particulars yet been sought or made, able or in any way adequate, either in

number, kind or certainty, to inform the intellect. To the contrary, learned

men (admittedly idle fellows and easy-going) have accepted in the forma-

tion or conﬁrmation of their philosophy some reports, or rather rumours

and whispers, of experience, and have given them the weight of legitimate

testimony. Imagine a kingdom or state basing its counsels and business

not on letters and reports from ambassadors and messengers worthy of

credence, but on the gossip of men about town and trivialities; this is just

the kind of administration that has been brought into philosophy, as far as

experience goes. Natural history contains nothing that has been researched

in the proper ways, nothing veriﬁed, nothing counted, nothing weighed,

nothing measured. But what is indeﬁnite and vague in observation is

deceiving and unreliable as information. And if this seems to anyone a

strange thing to say and an unjustiﬁed complaint, since Aristotle, so great

a man himself and supported by the resources of so great a king, achieved

such an accurate history of animals, and others with greater diligence (but

of Macedon and political opponent of Demosthenes.

Book I

less noise) have made many additions, and others again have composed

copious histories and narratives of plants, of metals and of fossils, he seems

not to be paying proper attention and seeing what is at stake here. The

method of a natural history which is made for itself is one thing; quite other

is the method of natural history which is gathered to inform the under-

standing in order to found a philosophy. These two histories diﬀer in many

ways, but especially in this, that the ﬁrst of them contains a variety of

natural species, not experiments of the mechanical arts. For just as in

politics each man's character and the hidden set of his mind and passions

is better brought out when he is in a troubled state than at other times, in

the same way also the secrets of nature reveal themselves better through

harassments applied by the arts than when they go on in their own way.

And so we have our best hope of natural philosophy once natural history

(which is its base and foundation) has been better organised; but not before.

XCIX

And again the very wealth of mechanical experiments reveals the supreme

poverty of the things which most help and assist the information of the

understanding. For a mechanic, who is by no means anxious about the

investigation of truth, does not direct his mind or stretch his hand to any-

thing but what is useful for his task. But the hope of further progress in the

sciences will be well founded only when natural history shall acquire and

accumulate many experiments which in themselves are of no use, but

which simply help towards the discovery of causes and axioms; these we

have been accustomed to call illuminating experiments as distinct from

proﬁtable experiments. And they have in themselves a wonderful power and

provision, namely that they never deceive or disappoint. For since they are

used not to make a product but to reveal the natural cause in something,

they equally answer to their intention, however they turn out; since they

put an end to the question.

C

Thus we must seek to acquire a greater stock of experiments, and experi-

ments of a diﬀerent kind than we have yet done; and we must also introduce

a quite diﬀerent method, order and process of connecting and advancing

experience. For casual experience which follows only itself (as we said above)



The New Organon

is merely groping in the dark, and rather bemuses men than informs them.

But when experience shall proceed by sure rules,51 serially and continuously,

something better may be expected from the sciences.

CI

But even when you have available and ready the stock and material of natural

history and experience that is necessary to the work of the intellect, or

philosophic work, the intellect is still quite unable to work on the material

on its own and by memory; as if one expected to be able to memorise and

master the calculations of an account book. Yet up to now the role of

thought has been more prominent than that of writing in the work of

discovery; no written experience has yet been developed, though we should

not approve any discovery unless it is in writing. When it shall come into

use, we may expect more from experience ﬁnally made literate.

CII

Moreover, since there are so vastly many particulars (a whole host of

particulars), and since they are so scattered and diﬀuse that they distract

and confound the understanding, we should not expect much from its

casual and undirected motions and cursory movements unless we intro-

duce arrangement and coordination by appropriate, well-organised and

living (so to speak) tables of discovery of things relevant to the subject of

the investigation, and apply our minds to the organised summaries of facts

which these tables provide.

CIII

But after a store of particulars has been put before us in the due and proper

order, we should not go straight on to investigate and discover new par-

ticulars or eﬀects, or if we do, we must not stop there. For after all the

experiments of all the arts have been collected and digested and have been

brought before the notice and judgement of one man, we do not deny that

from the actual transfer of experiments from one art to another, many new

things may be found which will be useful for human life and its condition,

51 lege certa



Book I

by means of the experience which we call written experience. And yet only

small things may be hoped from it; the more important are to be expected

from the new light of axioms drawn by a sure method and rule from

particulars, which may in turn indicate and point to new particulars. For

the road is not ﬂat, but goes up and down - up ﬁrst to the axioms, then down

to the eﬀects.

CIV

But we must not allow the understanding to leap and ﬂy from particulars

to remote and highly general axioms (such as the so-called principles of arts

and things), and on the basis of their unshakable truth, demonstrate and

explicate the intermediate axioms, as is still done, since the mind's natural

bent is prone to do this, and is even trained to it and made familiar with it

by the example of syllogistic demonstration. But one may only expect any-

thing from the sciences when the ascent is made on a genuine ladder, by

regular steps, without gaps or breaks, from particulars to lesser axioms and

then to intermediate axioms, one above the other, and only at the end to the

most general. For the lowest axioms are not far from bare experience. And

the highest axioms (as now conceived) are conceptual and abstract, and

have no solidity. It is the intermediate axioms which are the true, sound,

living axioms on which human aﬀairs and human fortunes rest; and also

the axioms above them, the most general axioms themselves, are not

abstract but are given boundaries by these intermediate axioms.

Therefore we do not need to give men's understanding wings, but rather

lead and weights, to check every leap and ﬂight. And this has not been done

before; but when it shall be done, we may have better hope of the sciences.

CV

In forming an axiom we need to work out a diﬀerent form of induction

from the one now in use; not only to demonstrate and prove so-called

principles, but also lesser and intermediate axioms, in fact all axioms. For

the induction which proceeds by simple enumeration is a childish thing,

its conclusions are precarious, and it is exposed to the danger of the con-

trary instance; it normally bases its judgement on fewer instances than is

appropriate, and merely on available instances. But the induction which

will be useful for the discovery and proof of sciences and arts should



The New Organon

separate out a nature, by appropriate rejections and exclusions; and then,

after as many negatives as are required, conclude on the aﬃrmatives. This

has not yet been done, nor even certainly tried except only by Plato, who

certainly makes use of this form of induction to some extent in settling on

deﬁnitions and ideas. But any number of things need to be included in a

true, legitimate account of this kind of induction or demonstration, which

have never occurred to anyone to think about, so that more eﬀort needs to

be put into this than has ever been spent on the syllogism. It is this kind of

induction whose help we must have not only to discover axioms but also to

deﬁne concepts. And we may certainly have the greatest hopes for this kind

of induction.

CVI

In forming axioms by this kind of induction we need also to conduct an

examination and trial as to whether the axiom being formed is only ﬁtted

and made to the measure of the particulars from which it is drawn, or

whether it has a larger or wider scope. If it is larger and wider in scope, we

must see whether, like a kind of surety, it gives conﬁrmation of its scope and

breadth by pointing to new particulars; so that we do not just stick to things

that are known, nor on the other hand extend our reach too far and grasp

at abstract forms and shadows, not at solid things clearly deﬁned in the

material. When these axioms come into use, then at last a well-founded

hope will truly have appeared.

CVII

And here we must also repeat what we said above about the enlargement of

natural philosophy and the relation52 of the particular sciences to it, so that

there will be no division and dismemberment of the sciences; without this,

little progress may be expected.

CVIII

And now we have ﬁnished speaking about the abolition of despair and the

acquisition of hope by dismissing or correcting the errors of the past. We

52 ., .



Book I

must now see if there are any other things that give hope. And this comes

to mind: if many useful things have been found by lucky accident or happy

opportunity when men were not looking for them but engaged on some-

thing else, no one can doubt that when they do look and attend to this thing

and not something else, and when they do so with method and order, not

impulsively and desultorily, many more things are bound to be uncovered.

For though it may happen now and again that someone may fall by pure

luck upon something which had evaded him before, when he was making

a great eﬀort and putting a lot of work into investigating it, nevertheless in

general the opposite is undoubtedly the case. Therefore many more things,

better things, and at more frequent intervals, are to be hoped from human

reason, hard work, direction and concentration than from chance, animal

instinct and so on, which are what up to now have been the origin of dis-

coveries.

CIX

This too might be cited as ground for hope, that some of the things dis-

covered in the past were such as no one would be likely to have any inkling

of before they were discovered; anyone would have ﬂatly rejected them as

impossible. For men are accustomed to divine the new by the example of

the old, and by an imagination schooled and stained by the old; which is

the most deceptive kind of thinking, seeing that much that is drawn from

the sources of things does not ﬂow through the usual channels.

If before the discovery of the cannon one had described the thing by its

eﬀects, and said something like this: ‘a discovery has been made, by which

the biggest walls and fortiﬁcations may be smashed and thrown down from

a great distance', men would surely have been likely to have many diﬀerent

ideas about increasing the force of catapults and siege-engines by means of

weights and wheels and similar mechanisms for battering and striking. But

a ﬁery wind so suddenly and violently expanding and exploding would have

been unlikely to occur to anyone's imagination or fancy; since he would not

have seen an example of these at ﬁrst hand, except perhaps in an earthquake

or thunderbolt, which men would immediately have been likely to reject as

monstrous forces of nature not imitable by human beings.

In the same manner, if before the discovery of the silkworm's thread

someone had remarked: ‘a kind of thread has been discovered which can be

used for clothes and furnishings, which is much ﬁner than linen or wool



The New Organon

thread and yet stronger, as well as softer and more lustrous', men's ﬁrst

thoughts would have been about some silken plant, or the delicate coat of

an animal, or bird feathers or down; but the web of a little worm and one

which is so productive and renews itself every year - they would surely

never come up with that. And if anyone had suggested a worm, he would

certainly have been made fun of for dreaming of a new kind of cobweb.

Similarly, if before the invention of the mariner's compass anyone had

remarked that an instrument has been invented by which the poles and the

points of the sky may be taken and distinguished with precision, men

would have got their imaginations to work on it and started talking about

the more precise construction of astronomical instruments in many

diﬀerent ways, but it would have seemed altogether incredible that

anything would be found whose motion agreed so well with the heavenly

bodies, not being itself a heavenly body but only a stone or metal substance.

Yet this and similar things through so many ages of the world have

been hidden from men, and were not discovered by philosophy or the

mechanical arts but by chance and accident; and they are of such a kind (as

we said before) that they are completely diﬀerent and remote from things

previously known, so that no prior conception53 would ever have led to

them.

Therefore it is very much to be expected that many exceedingly useful

things are still hidden in the bosom of nature which have no kinship or

analogy with things already discovered, but lie altogether outside the

paths of the imagination; which however have not yet been discovered;

but without a doubt will appear sometime, through the many twists

and turnings of the centuries, just as the discoveries mentioned above

appeared. However, if we follow the way we are now discussing, they may

be exhibited and anticipated speedily, suddenly and at once.

CX

Other discoveries too are seen to conﬁrm that the human race can miss and

ignore remarkable discoveries even when they are lying at their feet. For

though the inventions of gunpowder, silk from the silkworm, the mariner's

compass, or sugar or paper or similar things may seem to depend upon

certain properties of things and nature, yet the technique of printing

53 praenotio: Case refers to Greek prolepsis (a Stoic notion) and suggests ‘preconception'.



Book I

certainly contains nothing which is not open and almost obvious. And yet

men went without this magniﬁcent invention (which does so much for the

spread of learning) for so many centuries, because they did not notice that

though it is obviously more diﬃcult to place letter types than to write

letters by movements of the hand, it has the advantage that once letter types

are placed they are good for an inﬁnite number of printings, whereas

letters set down by hand are good only for the one script; or perhaps

because they did not notice that ink can be thickened so that it marks with-

out running, especially if the letters are face up and the impression is made

from above.

In this course of discovery the human mind is so often accustomed to be

awkward and unskilful that at ﬁrst it lacks conﬁdence and soon comes to

despise itself; and at ﬁrst it seems incredible to it that such-and-such a

thing can be discovered, but after it has been discovered, it again seems

incredible that it could elude men for so long. And this itself is rightly given

as grounds for hope, namely that a great store of inventions remains to be

found which may be brought out by what we call written experience, not

only by unearthing unknown operations but also by transferring,

compounding and applying operations already known,

CXI

Nor should we omit the following as a reason for hope. Think (if you will)

of the inﬁnite expenditure of talent, time and resources which men invest

in things and pursuits of much less use and value. If even a fraction were

turned to solid and sensible subjects, any diﬃculty could be overcome. The

reason why we decided to add this is that we plainly confess that such a

collection of experimental and natural history as we see in our mind's eye

and as it should be, is a great work, I may say a royal work, and a work of

much eﬀort and expense.

CXII

Let no one be frightened of the sheer number of particulars; in fact this

very thing should restore his hope. For the particular phenomena of the

arts and nature are a mere handful in comparison with the mind's ﬁctions

when they are abstracted and lose their connection with the evidence of

things. And the end of this route is plain, and almost in the vicinity; the



The New Organon

other has no end, it is an unending maze. For men have not yet spent much

time on experience, they have only grazed it lightly, but they have wasted

an inﬁnite time on cogitation and intellectual gymnastics. If there were any-

one present among us who would answer interrogatories about the facts of

nature, it would take only a few years to discover all causes and all sciences.

CXIII

We also think that men might take some encouragement from our example;

and we do not say this to boast, but because saying it is useful. Anyone who

is diﬃdent should see how I have (as I think) advanced the subject to some

degree, though I am the busiest man of my age in political aﬀairs, not in

very good health (which wastes a great deal of time), and a genuine pioneer

in this domain,54 not following in anyone's footsteps, nor sharing these

thoughts with any other human being, and yet constantly walking in the

true way and submitting my mind to nature. Then let them see from these

tokens we give what may be expected from men who have abundance

of leisure, and from cooperative labours and from the passage of time;

especially on a road which may be travelled not only by individuals (as

is the case in the way of reason), but where men's labours and eﬀorts

(particularly in the acquisition of experience) may be distributed in the

most suitable way and then reunited. For men will begin to know their own

strength when we no longer have countless men all doing the same thing,

but each man making a diﬀerent contribution.

CXIV

Lastly, even if the breeze of hope blew much more weakly and faintly from

this New Continent, still we believe that the attempt has to be made (unless

we want to be utterly despicable). For the danger of not trying and the

danger of not succeeding are not equal, since the former risks the loss of a

great good, the latter of a little human eﬀort. But from what we have said

and from other things which we have not said, it has seemed to us that we

have abundance of hope, whether we are men who press forward to meet

new experiences, or whether we are careful and slow to believe.

54 ‘pioneer': Bacon uses protopirus, a transliteration of an unusual Greek word which he might possi-

bly have found in Polybius, .., through Polybius' editor, Casaubon, whom Bacon invited to

England and spent time with.



Book I

CXV

And now we have ﬁnished speaking of the removal of despair, which has

been among the most powerful causes which have delayed and retarded the

progress of the sciences. And we have completed our discussion of the signs

and causes of error and of the prevailing inertia and ignorance; its subtler

causes, beyond the scope of popular judgement or observation, should be

related to what has been said about the Idols of the mind.

This is also the end of the destructive part of our Instauration. It has

consisted of three Rebuttals: the rebuttal of Native Human Reason left to

itself; the rebuttal of Demonstrations; and the rebuttal of Theories, or the

received philosophies and commonly accepted doctrines. Our rebuttal of

them has been such as it could be, namely by signs and the evidence of

causes; this is the only form of refutation available to us (since we disagree

with others about principles and forms of proof).

And therefore it is time for us to approach the actual art and norm of

Interpreting Nature; and yet a preliminary note still needs to be made. For

our purpose in this ﬁrst book of Aphorisms has been to prepare men's

minds both to understand and to accept what follows; now that the

platform55 of the mind has been scraped and made level, the next step is to

set it in a good position, with a favourable view towards what we shall

exhibit. For in a new business prejudice may be caused not only by the

inﬂuence of a powerful old belief, but also by a false preconception or

unwarranted image of the new thing being oﬀered. And therefore we shall

try to ensure that good and true opinions are held about the things we

are introducing, even if they are only for the time being, like an interest

payment, until the thing itself may be seen more clearly.

CXVI

First then it seems we must ask men not to suppose that we are trying to

found a new sect in philosophy, in imitation of the style of the ancient

Greeks or of certain moderns, such as Telesio, Patrizzi or Severinus.56 This

55 ‘platform' (Kitchin)

56 Bernardino Telesio (-), author of De rerum natura juxta propria principia [On the nature of

things according to their proper principles] (–), anti-Aristotelian; Francesco Patrizzi

(–), ‘the most systematic of the opponents of the Aristotelian philosophy in general' (Fowler,

‘Introduction', p. ), author of Discussiones peripateticae [Peripatetic discussions]; ‘Severinus' may

be either Petrus Severinus (–) or M. A. Severinus (–).



The New Organon

is not what we are doing, and we do not believe that it makes much

diﬀerence to men's fortunes what sort of abstract opinions anyone has

about the nature and principles of things. There is no doubt that many such

old opinions might be revived and new ones introduced, just as we may

entertain several hypotheses about the heavens which are more or less

compatible with the phenomena but incompatible with each other.

We are not working on such matters of opinion, useless things. On the

contrary, our design is to discover whether in truth we can lay ﬁrmer foun-

dations for human power and human greatness, and extend their limits

more widely. Here and there, in some special subjects, we have much truer,

more certain foundations (we believe) which are also more proﬁtable than

those which men now use (and we have collected them in the ﬁfth part of

our Renewal); nevertheless we are not proposing any universal or complete

theory. This does not seem to be the time for that. Moreover, we do not

expect to live long enough to complete the sixth part of our Renewal (which

is dedicated to the discovery of philosophy through the legitimate inter-

pretation of nature). We are content if we conduct ourselves soberly and

usefully in the middle parts, and scatter throughout the seeds of more

complete truth for posterity, and not falter at the commencement of great

things.57

CXVII

Thus we are not founders of a sect; nor are we benefactors or promisers

of particular results. But one might make this request, that we who so

often speak of results, and relate everything to that end, would also give

some samples of them. But our way and method (as we have often said

clearly, and are happy to say again) is not to draw results from results or

experiments from experiments (as the empirics do), but (as true

Interpreters of Nature) from both results and experiments to draw causes

and axioms, and from causes and axioms in turn to draw new results and

experiments.

It is true that in our tables of discovery (which is the content of the

fourth book of the Instauration), in the examples of particular things

which we have given in the second part, and also in our observations on

history, described in the third part, even a person of average insight and

57 Bacon did not live to complete any of these projected parts of The Great Renewal, though some

surviving short pieces were probably intended to be included in the great work.



Book I

intelligence will see here and there indications and pointers to several

remarkable results; but we openly admit that the natural history which

we have at this day, either from books or from personal examination, is not

so full and so properly veriﬁed that it can satisfy or serve legitimate

Interpretation.

Hence we give leave and permission to anyone who is better suited to

mechanical things, and better trained, and ingenious in deriving results

from mere acquaintance with experiments, to undertake the diﬃcult task

of gathering a good crop from our history and from our tables as he passes

by, taking an interest payment for the time being until the capital can be

had. But we have a larger goal, and condemn all untimely and premature

activity of this kind as balls of Atalanta (as we like to call them). We do not

grasp at golden apples like a child; but stake the whole race on the victory

of art over nature; we are in no hurry to collect moss or cut the green corn;

we wait for the harvest to be ready.

CXVIII

It will undoubtedly also occur to someone, after he has read our history

itself and the tables of invention, that there is some uncertainty, if not actual

falsehood, in the experiments themselves, and for that reason he will per-

haps think that our discoveries rest upon false and doubtful foundations

and principles. But this is nothing; such things are bound to happen at the

beginning. It is as if in writing or printing one or two letters happen to be

poorly formed or badly placed, it does not usually bother the reader very

much, since they are easily corrected by the sense itself. So men should

realise that many experiments in natural history may be wrongly believed

and accepted which a little while later are easily deleted and excluded from

the discovery of causes and axioms. It is true however that if many mistakes

are frequently and repeatedly made in natural history and experiments,

they cannot be corrected or emended by any successful exercise of intelli-

gence or art. If then there remain any faults or errors in particulars in our

natural history, which has been so diligently, strictly and even religiously

examined and collected, what may one say of the usual natural history,

which in comparison with ours is so careless and easy-going, or about the

philosophy and sciences built upon such sands (sinking sands, I would

say)? Thus what we have said should bother no one.



The New Organon

CXIX

In our history and experiments there will also be many things which are

trivial and common, many that are low and illiberal, many that are exces-

sively subtle, merely speculative and apparently useless: the kind of thing

that might turn people oﬀ and alienate their support.

Men should recognise that, with regard to ordinary things, they are

very liable simply to relate and adapt the causes of rare events to things

that happen frequently, but not to investigate the causes of the things that

happen frequently themselves; they take them as given and admitted.

And so they do not look for the causes of weight, of the rotation of the

heavenly bodies, of heat, cold, light, hard, soft, rare, dense, liquid, solid,

animate, inanimate, similar, dissimilar, or of the organic; they do however

argue and give judgements about other things which do not occur so fre-

quently and are not so familiar.

But we who know well enough that no judgement can be made of rare

or remarkable things, much less new things brought to light, without

investigation and discovery of the causes of common things and the causes

of their causes, we are necessarily forced to admit the commonest things

into our history. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the greatest obstacle to the

progress of philosophy has been that familiar things of frequent occurrence

do not arrest and hold men's contemplation; they are barely noticed in

passing, and no inquiry made as to their causes. We more often need to

pay attention to known things than to get information about unknown

things.

CXX

As for mean or even foul objects for which (as Pliny says) we have to

apologise, they have to be admitted to natural history no less than the most

elegant and valuable objects. Natural history is not polluted by them: the

sun enters palaces and drains indiﬀerently, and is not polluted. We are not

building or dedicating a Capitol or a Pyramid to men's pride, but are lay-

ing the foundations in the human intellect of a holy temple on the model

of the world. And so we follow the model. For whatever is worthy of being

is worthy also of knowledge, which is the image of being. And mean things

exist as well as elegant things. Moreover, just as the best perfumes are

sometimes made from smelly things like musk and civet, so excellent light

Book I

and information emerge from mean and dirty things. Enough of this; such

delicacy is altogether childish and eﬀeminate.

CXXI

But we must certainly take a more careful look at the objection that to the

common understanding, or any understanding accustomed to present

things, much in our history will seem to have a kind of curious and useless

subtlety. This needs to be discussed before anything, and has been dis-

cussed; and this is the point: that now as we begin, and for some time to

come, we are looking only for experiments that are enlightening, not

productive experiments. Our model is God's creation, as we have often

said, which on the ﬁrst day brought forth only light, and devoted the whole

day only to this, and made no work of matter on that day.

So anyone who thinks such things are useless thinks like one who

believes that light is useless because it is not a solid or material thing. And

in truth it must be said that a careful, well-sifted knowledge of simple

natures is like light, which aﬀords access to the universal secrets of eﬀects,

and has a kind of power to grasp and bring with it whole legions and

squadrons of eﬀects and the sources of the most remarkable axioms; but in

itself it is not very useful. Just so the letters of the alphabet by themselves

and separately from one another mean nothing and are no use, and yet are

like the ﬁrst matter for the composition and equipping of all discourse.

Seeds of things are strong in power, but (except in their own process) quite

useless. Dispersed rays of light itself impart no beneﬁt unless they come

together.

But if anyone is oﬀended by speculative subtleties, what should be said

of the scholastics and their massive indulgence in subtleties? Their

subtleties were spent on words or (which comes to the same thing) on

common notions, not on things or on nature; they were quite useless in

their origin and in their consequences; and were not the sort of subtleties

which have no usefulness for the present but inﬁnite utility in the conse-

quence, as are these of which we speak. Men should take it for certain that

all subtlety in disputation and reﬂection which is brought to bear only after

axioms have been discovered is tardy and too late. The true and proper time

for subtlety, or at least the best time, is in weighing experience and in form-

ing axioms from it. The other kind of subtlety grabs and touches nature,

but never grasps or catches it. The common saying about opportunity or



The New Organon

fortune is surely very true when applied to nature: ‘it is long-haired at the

front, but bald at the back'.58

A last remark on the contempt in natural history for things that are

common or mean, or too subtle and useless in their beginning: the retort

of the little woman to the pompous prince ought to be taken as an oracle;

he had refused to hear her petition as too petty for him and unworthy of

his majesty: ‘Cease then to be king', she said.59 For it is quite certain

that empire over nature can be neither gained nor exercised if one is un-

willing to attend to such things because they are too petty and too

small.

CXXII

It will60 also be objected that it is an incredibly brutal proceeding to do away

with all sciences and all authors instantaneously in one sudden attack, and

not to take anything from the ancients for our help and support, but to rely

on our own strength.

But we know that if we had been willing to act with less than complete

good honesty, it would not have been diﬃcult for us to attribute our pro-

posals either to the ancient centuries before the times of the Greeks (when

perhaps the sciences of nature were ﬂourishing more fully though in deeper

silence, without the beneﬁt of Greek pipes and trumpets) or even (for

part of it) to some of the Greeks themselves, and to seek the assurance

and honour that comes from that; like parvenus devising a fabricated

nobility for themselves from some ancient lineage by means of genealogies.

But we rely on the evidence of things, and reject even the suspicion of

ﬁction and imposture. We do not think that it is any more relevant to the

present subject whether the discoveries to come were once known to the

ancients, and have been dying and recurring in the revolutions of things

through the centuries, than it should matter to men whether the New

World is the famous island Atlantis which the ancient world knew or a

new land now discovered for the ﬁrst time. For the discovery of things is

to be taken from the light of nature, not recovered from the shadows of

antiquity.

As for my general criticism of past sciences, that is surely both more

Book I

plausible, on a true view, and more modest than a partial criticism. For if

the mistakes had not been rooted in ﬁrst notions, true discoveries would

have been bound to correct erroneous discoveries. But when there have

been fundamental mistakes, such that men have missed and ignored things

rather than made a bad or incorrect judgement of them, it is not at all

surprising that they have not got what they did not attempt, and have not

reached a goal which they had not set or ﬁxed, and have not completed a

race which they had neither entered nor run.

With regard to the insolence of the thing: certainly if someone claims

for himself that he can draw a straighter line or a more perfect circle than

anyone else by steadiness of hand and sharpness of eye, he is obviously

inviting a contest of abilities. But if anyone asserts that he can draw a

straighter line or a more perfect circle with the aid of a rule or pair of com-

passes than anyone else can with his unaided eye and hand, he is surely not

bragging at all. And what we say applies not only to our ﬁrst, preliminary

eﬀort, but is also applicable to those who devote themselves to this subject

in the future. For our method of discovery in the sciences more or less

equalises intellects, and leaves little opportunity for superiority, since it

achieves everything by most certain rules and forms of proof. Thus our

present work (as we have often said) is rather due to a kind of good luck

than to ability, and is a birth of time rather than of intellect. For there is

certainly an element of chance in men's thoughts no less than in their works

and deeds.

CXXIII

Therefore we must apply to ourselves the old story, especially as it cuts to

the heart of the matter: ‘when one man drinks water and the other wine, it

is impossible for them to think alike'. All other men, ancient and modern

alike, have in the sciences drunk a simple drink like water, either running

spontaneously from the understanding, or drawn up by dialectic as by

pulleys from a well. But we drink and make our toasts in a liquor which is

made61 from great numbers of grapes, ripe grapes, ready for the vintage,

gathered and cut from the stem in selected bunches, then crushed in the

winepress, then reﬁned and strained in a vessel. And so it is no surprise if

we do not agree with other people.

CXXIV

Here is another objection that will certainly come up: that (despite our

criticisms of others) we ourselves have not ﬁrst declared the true and best

goal or purpose of the sciences. For the contemplation of truth is worthier

and higher than any utility or power in eﬀects; but the long and anxious

time spent in experience and matter and in the ebb and ﬂow of particular

things keeps the mind ﬁxed on the ground, or rather sinks it in a Tartarus

of confusion and turmoil, and bars and obstructs its way to the serenity and

tranquillity of detached wisdom (a much more godlike condition). We

willingly assent to this argument; it is precisely this thing which they hint

and ﬁnd preferable which we are chieﬂy and above all engaged on. For

we are laying the foundations in the human understanding of a true model

of the world, as it is and not as any man's own reason tells him it is. But this

can be done only by performing a most careful dissection and anatomy of

the world. We declare that the inept models of the world (like imitations by

apes), which men's fancies have constructed in philosophies, have to be

smashed. And so men should be aware (as we said above)62 how great is

the distance between the illusions of men's minds and the ideas of God's

mind. The former are simply fanciful abstractions; the latter are the true

marks of the Creator on his creatures as they are impressed and printed

on matter in true and meticulous lines. Therefore truth and usefulness

are (in this kind) the very same things,63 and the works themselves are

of greater value as pledges of truth than for the beneﬁts they bring to

human life.

CXXV

It will also perhaps be objected that we are doing something that has

already been done, that the ancients themselves went the same way as we

do. And so one will think it likely that after so much eﬀort and commotion,

we too will settle at last on one of the philosophies which prevailed among

the ancients. For they too in commencing their reﬂections laid in an

immense stock of examples and particulars, and arranged them in treatises

by section and title, and built their philosophies and systems from them,

and afterwards, having got some information on the subject, gave their

62 ..

63 ipsissimae res: for the sentiment, cf. ..



Book I

judgements and added occasional examples to win credence and illustrate

their teaching, but thought it a waste of time and trouble to publish their

notes on particulars, and their notebooks and treatises; and thus did what

men do in building, namely after completion of the building, remove the

scaﬀolding and ladders from sight. That is certainly the process one should

think occurred. But one will easily meet this objection (or rather scruple)

if one has not completely forgotten what we said above. For we too64 admit

there was a form of inquiry and discovery among the ancients, and their

writings make clear what it was. It was simply that from some examples

and particulars (with the addition of common notions, and perhaps a dose

of the most popular received opinions) they leapt to the most general con-

clusions or principles of the sciences, by whose ﬁxed and immovable truth

they might deduce and demonstrate lesser conclusions by intermediate

steps; and from these they formed their system. Then ﬁnally if new

particulars and examples were proposed and adduced which ran contrary

to their views, they cleverly brought them into line by means of distinctions

or explanations of their own rules, or in the last analysis got rid of them

altogether by making exceptions; but they laboriously and obstinately

adapted to their principles the cases of particular things which were not

contrary. But that was not natural history and experience as it should have

been (far from it), and their hasty ﬂight to the most general principles

destroyed everything.

CXXVI

Here is another objection: that in our hesitation to make pronouncements

and to lay down ﬁxed principles until we duly arrive by way of intermediate

steps at the most general principles, we maintain a kind of suspension of

judgement, and bring the thing down to Lack of Conviction (Acatalepsia).

But what we have in mind and propose is not Acatalepsia but Eucatalepsia

(Sound Conviction): for we do not detract from the senses, but assist them;

we do not discredit the understanding, but regulate it. And it is better to

know as much as we need to know, and yet think that we do not know every-

thing, than to think that we know everything, and yet know none of the

things which we need to know.

It may also be doubted (rather than objected) whether we are speaking of

perfecting only Natural Philosophy by our method or also the other

sciences, Logic, Ethics and Politics. We certainly mean all that we have said

to apply to all of them; and just as common logic, which governs things by

means of the syllogism, is applicable not only to the natural sciences but to

all the sciences, so also our science, which proceeds by induction, covers all.

For we are making a history and tables of discovery about anger, fear, shame

and so on; and also about instances of political aﬀairs; and equally about the

mental motions of memory, composition and division, of judgement

and the rest, no less than of heat and cold, or light, or vegetative growth,

and so on. However, since our method of interpretation, after a history has

been collected and organised, looks not only at the motions and activities

of the mind (as the common logic does), but also at the nature of things we

so govern the mind that it may apply itself to the nature of things, in

ways that are suitable to all things. And therefore we give many diﬀerent

instructions in our teaching of interpretation which in some degree adapt

the method of discovery to the quality and condition of the subject of

inquiry.

CXXVIII

But it would be wrong even to entertain a doubt about whether we desire

to destroy and abolish the philosophy, the arts and the sciences which we

use; on the contrary, we happily embrace their use, their cultivation and

their rewards. We do not in any way discourage these traditional subjects

from generating disputations, enlivening discourse and being widely

applied to professional use and the beneﬁt of civil life, and from being

accepted by general agreement as a kind of currency. Furthermore, we

freely admit that our new proposals will not be very useful for those

purposes, since there is no way that they can be brought down to the

common understanding, except through their results and eﬀects. But our

published writings (and especially the books On the Advancement of

Learning) testify how sincerely we mean what we say of our aﬀection and

goodwill towards the accepted sciences. And so we shall not try further to

convince with words. In the meantime we give this constant and explicit

warning: no great progress can be made in the doctrines and thinking



Book I

of the sciences, nor can they be applied to a wide range of works, by the

methods commonly in use.

CXXIX

It remains to say a few things about the excellence of the Purpose. If we had

said these things before, they would have seemed like mere wishes, but now

that hope has been given, and unwarranted prejudices removed, they will

perhaps have more weight. And if we had completed and quite ﬁnished the

whole thing, if we were not inviting others to play a part from now on and

take a share in our labours, then too we would have refrained from words

of this kind, in case they should be taken as a proclamation of our own

merit. But since we have to excite the industry of others and stir their hearts

and set them on ﬁre, it is appropriate to recall certain things to men's

minds.

First therefore, the introduction of remarkable discoveries holds by far

the ﬁrst place among human actions; as the ancients judged. For they

ascribed divine honours to discoverers of things; but to those who had

made great achievements in political matters (such as founders of cities and

empires, legislators, liberators of their countries from long-standing evils,

conquerors of tyrants and so on) they decreed only the honours of heroes.

And anyone who duly compares them will ﬁnd this judgement of antiquity

correct. For the beneﬁts of discoveries may extend to the whole human

race, political beneﬁts only to speciﬁc areas; and political beneﬁts last

no more than a few years, the beneﬁts of discoveries for virtually all time.

The improvement of a political condition usually entails violence and

disturbance; but discoveries make men happy, and bring beneﬁt without

hurt or sorrow to anyone.

Again, discoveries are like new creations, and imitations of divine works;

as the poet well said:

Athens, of glorious name, was once the ﬁrst to give fruitful crops to men in their

misery, and  their life, and made them laws.65

And it seems worthy of note in Solomon, that though he abounded in

power, gold, magniﬁcent works, courtiers, servants, in naval power too, and

65 Lucretius, On the Nature of Things, .-. In the edition of Cyril Bailey (Oxford Classical Texts,

nd edn, Oxford, ) the lines are printed as ‘Primae frugiparos fetus mortalibus aegris/

dididerunt quondam praeclaro nomine Athenae/et recreaverunt vitam legesque rogarunt.'

The New Organon

the fame of his name and unparalleled human admiration, yet he selected

none of these things as his glory, but declared as follows: ‘the glory of God

is to conceal a thing; the glory of a king is to ﬁnd out a thing'.66

Again (if you please), let anyone reﬂect how great is the diﬀerence

between the life of men in any of the most civilised provinces of Europe and

in the most savage and barbarous region of New India; and he will judge

that they diﬀer so much that deservedly it may be said that ‘man is a God

to man',67 not only for help and beneﬁt, but also in the contrast between

their conditions. And this is due not to soil, climate or bodily qualities, but

to Arts.

Again, it helps to notice the force, power and consequences of dis-

coveries, which appear at their clearest in three things that were unknown

to antiquity, and whose origins, though recent, are obscure and unsung:

namely the art of printing, gunpowder and the nautical compass. In fact

these three things have changed the face and condition of things all over

the globe: the ﬁrst in literature; the second in the art of war; the third in

navigation; and innumerable changes have followed; so that no empire or

sect or star seems to have exercised a greater power and inﬂuence on human

aﬀairs than those mechanical things.

And it would not be irrelevant to distinguish three kinds and degrees of

human ambition. The ﬁrst is the ambition of those who are greedy to

increase their personal power in their own country; which is common and

base. The second is the ambition of those who strive to extend the power

and empire of their country among the human race; this surely has more

dignity, but no less greed. But if anyone attempts to renew and extend the

power and empire of the human race itself over the universe of things, his

ambition (if it should so be called) is without a doubt both more sensible

and more majestic than the others'. And the empire of man over things lies

solely in the arts and sciences. For one does not have empire over nature

except by obeying her.

Besides, if the usefulness of any one particular discovery has moved men

to regard anyone who could confer such a beneﬁt on the whole human race

as more than a man, how much nobler will it appear to make a discovery

which may speedily lead to the discovery of all other things? And yet

(simply to tell the truth) just as we owe much gratitude to light, because we

in turn can see by it to ﬁnd our way, practise the arts, read and recognise

66 Proverbs :.

67 A saying attributed to Caecilius Comicus.



Book I

each other, and yet the actual seeing of light is a more excellent and ﬁner

thing than its many uses, so surely the very contemplation of things as they

are, without superstition or deceit, error or confusion, is more valuable in

itself than all the fruits of discoveries.

Finally, if anyone objects that the sciences and arts have been perverted

to evil and luxury and such like, the objection should convince no one. The

same may be said of all earthly goods, intelligence, courage, strength,

beauty, wealth, the light itself and all the rest. Just let man recover the right

over nature which belongs to him by God's gift, and give it scope; right

reason and sound religion will govern its use.

CXXX

And now it is time to lay out the actual art of Interpreting Nature. Though

we believe that what we teach here is what is truest and most useful, still

we do not say that it is absolutely essential (as if nothing could be done

without it) or even totally complete. For it is our opinion that men could

hit upon our form of interpretation simply by their own native force of

intelligence, without any other art, if they had available a good history of

nature and experience, and worked carefully on it, and were able to give

themselves two commands: one, to lay aside received opinions and notions;

the other, to restrain their minds for the time being from the most general

principles and the next most general. For interpretation is the true and

natural work of the mind once the obstacles are removed; but still every-

thing will certainly be more in readiness because of our instructions, and

much more secure.

Yet we are not claiming that nothing could be added to them. On the

contrary, we who look at the mind not only in its own native ability, but also

in its union with things, must take the position that the art of discovery may

improve with discoveries.
