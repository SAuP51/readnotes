## Book II

Aphorism 

### 01

The task and purpose of human Power is to generate and superinduce on

a given body a new nature or new natures. The task and purpose of human

Science is to ﬁnd for a given nature its Form, or true diﬀerence, or causative

nature or the source of its coming-to-be (these are the words we have that

come closest to describing the thing). Subordinate to these primary tasks

are two other tasks which are secondary and of less importance: to the ﬁrst

is subordinate the transformation of concrete bodies from one thing into

another within the bounds of the Possible; to the latter is subordinate the

discovery, in every generation and motion, of the continuous hidden process

from the manifest Eﬃcient cause and the observable matter to the acquired

Form; and similarly, the discovery, in bodies at rest and not in motion, of

the latent structure.

II

The sorry state of current human knowledge is clear even from common

expressions. It is right to lay down: ‘to know truly is to know by causes'. It

is also not bad to distinguish four causes: Material, Formal, Eﬃcient

and Final. But of these the Final is a long way from being useful; in fact it

actually distorts the sciences except in the case of human actions. Discovery

of Form is regarded as hopeless. And the Eﬃcient and Material causes (as

they are commonly sought and accepted, i.e. in themselves and apart from

the latent process which leads to the Form) are perfunctory, superﬁcial

things, of almost no value for true, active knowledge. Nor have we forgot-



Book II

ten that earlier we criticised and corrected the error of the human mind in

assigning to Forms the principal role in being.1 For though nothing exists

in nature except individual bodies which exhibit pure individual acts

in accordance with law, in philosophical doctrine, that law itself, and the

investigation, discovery and explanation of it, are taken as the foundation

both of knowing and doing. It is this law and its clauses2 which we under-

stand by the term Forms, especially as this word has become established

and is in common use.

III

He who knows the cause of a nature (as of white or of heat) only in certain

subjects has an imperfect Knowledge of it; and he who can produce an

eﬀect only on some of the susceptible materials has a Power which is

equally imperfect. And he who knows only the Eﬃcient and Material

causes (causes which are variable, and merely vehicles and capable of

conveying forms in some things only) may achieve new discoveries in

material which is fairly similar and previously prepared, but does not touch

the deeply rooted ends of things. But he who knows forms comprehends

the unity of nature in very diﬀerent materials. And so he can uncover and

bring forth things which have never been achieved, such as neither the

vicissitudes of nature nor experimental eﬀorts nor even chance have ever

brought into being and which were unlikely ever to enter men's minds.

Hence true Thought and free Operation result from the discovery of

Forms.

IV

Although the road to human knowledge and the road to human power are

very close and almost the same, yet because of the destructive and inveterate

habit of losing oneself in abstraction, it is altogether safer to raise the

sciences from the beginning on foundations which have an active tendency,

and let the active tendency itself mark and set bounds to the contemplative

part. And therefore when we think about generating and superinducing a

nature on a given body, we must consider what sort of instruction and what

1 primas essentiae: cf. . and ..

2 Bacon seems to have in mind the analogy of statute law, which was structured as a single (very long)

sentence with paragraph-shaped clauses.



The New Organon

sort of direction or guidance one would most want; and we should do it in

simple, not abstruse, language.

For example: if one wants to superinduce on silver the tawny colour of

gold, or an increase of weight (with respect for the laws of the substance),

or transparency on non-transparent stone, or strength on glass, or the

ability to grow on something which is not vegetable, one must consider

(I say) what sort of instruction or guidance a person would most wish to be

given. And in the ﬁrst place, he will certainly want to be shown something

which would not fail in eﬀect or disappoint in experiment. Secondly, he

will desire to be prescribed something which would not force and conﬁne

him to certain ways and means of operating. For perhaps he will not

have these particular means, and not have the opportunity of easily getting

and procuring them. If there are other means and other ways (apart

from this instruction) of producing such a nature, perhaps they will be

within the power of the operator, but he will be prevented from using

them because his instructions are too narrow, and he will get no results.

Thirdly, he will want to be shown something which is not as diﬃcult as

the operation which he is investigating, but which comes closer to

practice.

This then will have to be our declaration on the true and perfect precept

of operation: it should be certain, free and favourable to, or tending towards,

action. And this is the same as the discovery of true Form. For the form of

a nature is such that if it is there, the given nature inevitably follows. Hence

it is always present when the nature is present; it universally aﬃrms it, and

is in the whole of it. The same form is such that when it is taken away,

the given nature inevitably disappears. And therefore it is always absent

when that nature is absent, and its absence always implies the absence of

that nature, and it exists only in that nature. Finally, a true form is such that

it derives a given nature from the source of an essence which exists in

several subjects, and which is better known to nature (as they say)3 than

the Form itself. And so our declaration and precept about the true and

perfect axiom of knowledge is this: ﬁnd another nature that is convertible with

a given nature, and yet is a limitation of a better-known nature, as of a true

genus. These two pronouncements, the active and the contemplative,

are one and the same; and what is most useful in operating is truest in

knowing.

for example, ..

V

The precept or axiom of the transformation of bodies is of two kinds. The

ﬁrst looks at the body as a company or combination of simple natures. For

example, the following things are all found together in gold; it is tawny-

coloured; it is heavy with a certain weight; it is malleable or ductile to a

certain degree; it is not volatile, and loses none of its quantity in ﬁre; it

melts with a certain ﬂuidity; it is separated and dissolved in certain ways;

and so on for the rest of the natures which are found together in gold. Thus

this kind of axiom derives the object from the forms of simple natures. For

he who knows the forms and methods of superinducing tawny colour,

weight, ductility, stability, melting, solution and so on, and their degrees

and manners, will take pains to try to unite them in some body, and from

this follows the transformation into gold. This kind of operation is a

primary action. For it is the same method to generate some one simple

nature as several, except that there is more constraint and restriction in

operating if several are required, because of the diﬃculty of uniting so

many natures, which are not easily brought together except by the common,

ordinary ways of nature. It must in any case be said however that this mode

of operation (which looks at simple natures, albeit in a compound body)

proceeds from what is constant, eternal and universal in nature, and aﬀords

vast opportunities to human power, such as human thought (as things are

now) can scarcely conceive or imagine.

But the second kind of axiom (which depends on the discovery of the

latent process) does not proceed by simple natures, but by compound bodies

as they are found in nature in the ordinary course of things. This is so, for

example, in the case where one is investigating the origins, means and

process by which gold or any other metal or stone is generated from their

base substances or elements to the perfect mineral; or similarly the process

by which plants are generated, from the ﬁrst solidifying of the sap in the

soil, or from seeds, up to the formed plant, with constant succession of

motion, and with diverse yet continuous eﬀorts of nature; likewise, of the

orderly progress of the generation of animals from conception to birth; and

similarly of other bodies.

For this investigation looks not only at the generation of bodies, but also

at other movements and workings of nature. For example, it looks at the

case where the inquiry is about the universal process and continuous action

of nutrition, from the ﬁrst ingestion of food to its perfect assimilation; or



The New Organon

similarly, about voluntary motion in animals, from the ﬁrst impression on

the imagination and the continued eﬀorts of the spirit right up to the ﬂex-

ing and moving of the limbs; or [about the process] from the unfolding of

the tongue, the lips and the other organs to the uttering of articulate

sounds. For these too are concerned with compound natures, or natures

which are joint members of a structure; and they have regard to special and

particular habits of nature, not the fundamental and common laws which

constitute Forms. Nevertheless, one must fully admit that this method

looks easier and more available, and oﬀers more hope, than the primary

one.

Likewise the operative function which corresponds to this contempla-

tive function extends the operation and moves it on from things ordinarily

found in nature to things close to them or not too remote. But deeper,

radical operations on nature depend altogether on primary axioms.

Furthermore, where man has not been granted the right to operate but

only to know, as in the case of celestial objects (for man is not permitted to

operate on celestial things or to alter or transform them), still investigation

of the fact itself or of the truth of the matter, no less than knowledge of

causes and agreements, takes one back to the primary, universal axioms

about simple natures (as about the nature of spontaneous rotation, about

attraction or magnetic force, and about several other things which are more

common than the celestial things themselves). One cannot expect to settle

the question whether the earth or heaven really turns in daily motion with-

out ﬁrst understanding the nature of spontaneous rotation.

VI

The latent process of which we speak is a very diﬀerent thing from anything

that will readily occur to men's minds (given present preconceptions). For

we do not mean actual measures, signs or stages of a process which are

visible in bodies, but a wholly continuous process which for the most part

escapes the senses.

Example: in every case of generation and transformation of a body we

have to ask what is lost and disappears; what remains and what accrues;

what expands and what contracts; what is combined, what is separated;

what is continuous, what interrupted; what impels, what obstructs; what

prevails, what submits; and several other questions.

Nor are these questions to be asked only in cases of generation and trans-



Book II

formation of bodies. In the case of all other modiﬁcations and motions we

must similarly ask what precedes, what succeeds; what is more pressing,

what more relaxed; what furnishes motion and what guides it; and so on.

All these things are unknown and unbroached by the sciences (which are

currently practised by the dullest and most unsuitable persons). For since

every natural action is transacted by means of the smallest particles, or at

least by things too small to make an impression on the senses, no one should

expect to master or modify nature without taking the appropriate means to

grasp and take note of them.

VII

Similarly, the investigation and discovery of the latent structure in bodies

is a new thing, no less than the discovery of latent process and form. We

are clearly still hovering about the anterooms of nature and are not

achieving entrance to her inner chambers. But no one can endow a given

body with a new nature or successfully and appropriately transmute it into

a new body without possessing a good knowledge of modiﬁcation or trans-

formation of body. He will ﬁnd himself using useless methods, or at least

diﬃcult and cumbersome methods unsuitable for the nature of the body

on which he is working. Thus here too the road needs to be opened and

constructed.

It is surely right and useful to spend eﬀort on the anatomy of organic

bodies (as of man and of the animals), and it seems to be a subtle thing

and a good search of nature. This kind of anatomy is perceptible and

open to the senses and appropriate only in the case of organic bodies. But

it is an obvious and easily available thing compared with the true anatomy

of latent structure in bodies regarded as similar; especially in things of the

same species and their parts, as iron and stone; and in the similar parts

of a plant or animal; as the root, the leaf, ﬂower, ﬂesh, blood, bone etc.

But even in this case human industry has not wholly failed; this is actually

the tendency of distillations and other methods of solution, that the dis-

similarity of a compound should appear through the gathering together of

homogeneous parts. And this is useful, and helps towards what we are

looking for, though often enough the thing is deceptive, because several

natures are assigned and attributed to the separated substance as if they had

subsisted previously in the compound, whereas in truth ﬁre and heat and

the other agents of opening it up give and superinduce them for the ﬁrst



The New Organon

time. But this too is a small part of the work of discovering the true struc-

ture in the compound; this structure is a much more subtle and precise

thing, and is rather obscured by the eﬀects of ﬁre than revealed and

illuminated.

Therefore separation and dissolution of bodies is certainly not to be

achieved through ﬁre, but by reason and true induction, with auxiliary

experiments; and by comparison with other bodies, and the reduction to

simple natures and their forms which assemble and unite in the compound;

one must make a clean break with Vulcan, and move to the side of Minerva,

if one wants to bring into the light the true textures and structures of

bodies (and every hidden and, as they say, speciﬁc property and power

in things depends upon this; and also therefore every rule for eﬀective

modiﬁcation and transformation derives from it).

Example: one must ask of every body how much spirit there is in it, and

how much tangible essence; and of the spirit itself ask whether it is

abundant and swelling, or weak and sparse; thinner or denser; tending to

air or ﬁre; sharp or sluggish; feeble or robust; advancing or retreating;

broken or continuous; at home or at odds with the surrounding environ-

ment, etc. Likewise the tangible essence (which allows as many diﬀerences

as spirit), with its hairs and ﬁbres and textures of every kind, is subject to

the same inquiry, and so is the distribution of the spirit through the bodily

mass, and its pores, passages, veins and cells, and the rudiments or ﬁrst

attempts at organic body. True, clear light is shed on these too, and thus

on every discovery of latent structure, by the primary axioms, which surely

dispel all darkness and every subtlety.

VIII

However, we will not end up with the atom, which presupposes a vacuum

and unmoving matter (both of which are false), but to true particles as they

are found to be. But there is no reason why anyone should shy away from

this subtlety as inexplicable; on the contrary, the more the inquiry moves

towards simple natures, the more all things will be in a plain, transparent

light; as the procedure passes from the multiple to the simple, from the

incommensurable to the commensurable, from the random to the calculable,

and from the inﬁnite and undeﬁned to the deﬁnite and certain; as it is with

the letters in writing and the notes in chords. Natural inquiry succeeds best

when the physical ends in the mathematical. And no one should be afraid



Book II

of multiplicity or of fractions. For in numerical calculations one would as

easily posit or think of a thousand as of one, or of a thousandth part as

easily as of a whole.

IX

A true division of philosophy and the sciences arises from the two kinds of

axioms which have been given above, if we translate the normal words

(which come closest to indicating the thing) into our own terms. The

inquiry after forms, which are (at least by reason and their law) eternal and

unmoving, would constitute metaphysics; the inquiry after the eﬃcient and

material causes, the latent process and latent structure (all of which are

concerned with the common and ordinary course of nature, not the

fundamental, eternal laws) would constitute physics; subordinate to these

in the same manner are two practical arts: mechanics to physics; and magic

to metaphysics (in its reformed sense), because of its broad ways and

superior command over nature.

X

Having laid down the scope of our teaching, we proceed to precepts; and

in the least awkward and unnatural order. Directions for the interpretation

of nature comprehend in general terms two parts: the ﬁrst for drawing

axioms from experience; the second on deducing or deriving new experi-

ments from axioms. The former is divided three ways, i.e. into three kinds

of service: service to the senses, service to the memory and service to the

mind or reason.

First we must compile a good, adequate natural and experimental history.

This is the foundation of the matter. We must not invent or imagine what

nature does or suﬀers; we must discover it.

A natural and experimental history is so diverse and disconnected that it

confounds and confuses the understanding unless it is stopped short, and

presented in an appropriate order. So tables must be drawn up and a co-

ordination of instances made, in such a way and with such organisation that

the mind may be able to act upon them.

Even with these, the mind, left to itself and moving of its own accord, is

incompetent and unequal to the formation of axioms unless it is governed

and directed. And therefore, in the third place, a true and proper induction



The New Organon

must be supplied, which is the very key of interpretation. And one must

begin at the end and move backwards to the rest.

XI

The investigation of forms proceeds as follows: ﬁrst, for any given nature

one must make a presentation4 to the intellect of all known instances which

meet in the same nature, however disparate the materials may be. A

collection of this kind has to be made historically, without premature

reﬂection or any great subtlety. Here is an example in the inquiry into the

form of heat.

[Table 1]

Instances meeting in the nature of heat

. the sun's rays, especially in summer and at noon

. the sun's rays reﬂected and concentrated, as between mountains or

through walls, and particularly in burning glasses

. ﬂaming meteors

. lightning that sets ﬁres

. eruptions of ﬂame from hollows in mountains etc.

. any ﬂame

. solids on ﬁre

. natural hot baths

. heated or boiling liquids

. steam and hot smoke, and air itself, which is capable of a powerful,

furious heat if compressed, as in reverse furnaces5

. some spells of weather which are clear and bright through the actual

constitution of the air without regard to the time of the year

. air shut up underground in some caverns, especially in winter

. all ﬁbrous fabrics, such as wool, animal hides and plumage, have some

. all bodies, solid and liquid, thick and thin (like the air itself) brought

court. ‘Presentation of instances' is intended to preserve something of the legal analogy.

5 ‘「Reverbatories」are furnaces constructed with two chambers; an outer one, which has no chimney,

but has a passage connecting it with an inner one which has a chimney' (Kitchin).



Book II

. sparks from ﬂint and steel sharply struck

. any body forcefully rubbed, as stone, wood, cloth etc.; so that yoke-

beams and wheel axles sometimes catch ﬁre; and the Western Indians

have a way of making ﬁre by rubbing

. green, wet plants conﬁned and compressed, like roses, peas in baskets;

so that hay often catches ﬁre if it is stored wet

. quicklime sprinkled with water

. iron as it is dissolved by aqua fortis in a glass without any use of ﬁre;

and likewise tin etc., but not so intensely

. animals, especially internally, where they are constantly hot, though in

insects the heat is not perceptible to the touch because they are so small

. horse shit, and similar animal excrement, when fresh

. strong oil of sulphur and of vitriol give the eﬀect of heat in scorching

linen

gums

. oil of marjoram and suchlike give the eﬀect of heat when they burn the

. strong distilled spirit of wine gives the eﬀect of heat; so that if the white

of an egg is dipped in it, it solidiﬁes and goes white, almost like a

cooked eggwhite; and bread dipped in it dries up and goes crusty like

toast

. spices and hot plants, like dracunculus, old nasturtium6 etc., though

they are not hot to the hand (neither whole nor powdered), but with a

little bit of chewing are felt as hot to the tongue and palate, and almost

burning

. strong vinegar and all acids cause a pain which is not much diﬀerent

from the pain of heat if applied to a skinless part of the body, like the

eye or the tongue, or any other part where there is a wound and the skin

has been wounded and the skin has been broken

. even sharp, intense cold induces a kind of burning sensation: for ‘the

penetrating cold of the North Wind burns'7

. other things.

We call this the table of existence and presence.

Secondly, we must make a presentation8 to the intellect of instances which

are devoid of a given nature; because (as has been said) the form ought no

less to be absent when a given nature is absent than present when it is

present. But this would be inﬁnite if we took them all.

And therefore we should attach negatives to our aﬃrmatives, and investi-

gate absences only in subjects which are closely related to others in which

a given nature exists and appears. This we have chosen to call the table of

divergence, or of closely related absences.

[Table 2]

Closely related instances which are devoid of the nature of heat

. the ﬁrst negative or attached instance to the ﬁrst aﬃrmative instance.9 The

moon's rays and those of the stars and comets are not found to be hot to the

touch; moreover, the sharpest frosts are normally observed at the full

moon. But the larger ﬁxed stars are thought to increase and intensify the

heat of the sun when it goes under them or approaches them; as happens

when the sun is in Leo and in the dog days.

. negative to the second aﬃrmative instance. The sun's rays do not give oﬀ

heat in the middle region of the air (as they call it); the common explana-

tion of this is quite good, that that region does not come close enough to

the body of the sun, from which the rays emanate, nor to the earth, by

which they are reﬂected. This is clear from the tops of mountains (unless

they are particularly high) where the snows are perpetual. On the other

hand some travellers have remarked that at the summit of the Peak of

Tenerife10 and also on the Peruvian Andes, the actual peaks of the moun-

tains are destitute of snow; the snow lies only on the lower slopes. And also

on the actual summits the air is observed not to be cold but thin and sharp;

so that in the Andes its excessive sharpness stings and hurts the eyes, and

also stings the mouth of the stomach and causes vomiting. It was also

noticed by writers in antiquity that the air at the top of Olympus11 was so

Book II

thin that those who made the ascent had to take sponges soaked in vinegar

and water and apply them from time to time to mouth and nostrils, because

the thinness of the air made it inadequate for breathing. It was also said of

that peak that it was so calm and undisturbed by rain and snow that letters

traced with their ﬁngers by the celebrants in the ashes on the altar of Jupiter

remained there undisturbed till the following year. And even today those

who ascend to the top of the Peak of Tenerife do so at night and not in the

day; and soon after sunrise are advised and prompted by their guides to

make their descent quickly because of the danger (it seems) from the thin-

ness of the air that it will interfere with their breathing and choke them.

. to the second. In the regions near the polar circles, the reﬂection of the

sun's rays is found to be very weak and unproductive of heat. And so the

Dutch who wintered in Novaya Zemlya,12 waiting for their ship to be freed

and released by the pack ice which was holding it fast, gave up hope about

the beginning of July, and had to take to the longboats. So the direct rays

of the sun seem to have little power even on ﬂat terrain; nor do reﬂected

rays, unless they are multiplied and combined, as happens when the sun

approaches the perpendicular. The reason is that at that time the incidence

of the rays forms quite acute angles, so that their lines are closer together;

by contrast, when the inclinations are high, the angles are very obtuse, and

consequently the lines of the rays further apart. However, one should note

that there may be many ways in which the sun's rays may work, as well as

from the nature of heat, which are not suited to our touch, so that they do

not cause heat for us but do produce the eﬀects of heat for some other

bodies.

. to the second. Try this experiment: take a lens made the opposite way

from a burning-glass, and place it between the hand and the sun's rays; and

observe whether it diminishes the heat of the sun as a burning-glass

increases and intensiﬁes it. For it is clear in the case of optical rays that the

images appear wider or narrower, according to the thickness of the lens at

the centre and the edges respectively. The same thing should be studied

with regard to heat.

. to the second. Carefully try an experiment whether by means of the

strongest and best-made burning-glasses the rays of the moon can be

caught and combined to produce even the smallest degree of heat. If

perhaps the degree of heat is too subtle and weak to be perceptible and

ing the North-East Passage.



The New Organon

observable to the touch we shall have to try the glasses13 which indicate the

hot or cold constitution of the air. Let the rays of the moon fall through the

burning-glass and be cast on the top of a glass of this kind; and take note

whether a depression of the water occurs due to heat.

. to the second. Train a burning-glass on a hot body which is not radiant

or luminous, e.g. iron and stone which is heated but not on ﬁre, or boiling

water, and so on; and note whether an increase and intensiﬁcation of heat

occurs, as with the sun's rays.

. to the second. Train a burning-glass on an ordinary ﬂame.

. to the third. Comets (if we may regard them as a kind of meteor14)

are not found to have a regular or obvious eﬀect in increasing seasonal

temperatures, though dry spells have often been noticed to follow them.

Moreover, beams and columns and gulfs of light15 and such things appear

more often in the winter than in the summer; and especially in very intense

cold spells, which are also dry spells. But forked lightning and sheet light-

ning and thunder rarely occur in winter; rather at the time of the greatest

heats. But the so-called falling stars are commonly thought to consist of

some viscous material which is shining and burning, rather than to be of a

powerful ﬁery nature. But this needs further inquiry.

. to the fourth. There is some sheet lightning which gives light but does

not burn; it always occurs without thunder.

. to the ﬁfth. Outbursts and eruptions of ﬂame are found in cold, no

less than in hot, regions, e.g. in Iceland and Greenland; just as trees too are

sometimes more inﬂammable - more pitchy and resinous - in cold than in

hot regions; as is the case with e.g. the ﬁr, the pine and so on. But there has

not been enough inquiry into what sort of situation and kind of terrain such

eruptions normally occur in, to enable us to append a negative to the

aﬃrmative.

. to the sixth. All ﬂame is more or less hot, and there is no negative

attached; however, they do say that the so-called ignis fatuus, which even

sometimes settles on a wall, does not have much heat, perhaps like the ﬂame

of spirit of wine, which is gentle and weak. The ﬂame which is found

appearing around the heads and hair of boys and girls in some serious,

reliable histories seems to be still weaker; it did not burn the hair at all

but softly ﬂickered around it. It is also quite certain that a kind of gleam

13 Thermometers

14 Or perhaps ‘heavenly body'.

15 This seems to be a reference to the aurora borealis.



Book II

without obvious heat has appeared around a horse sweating as it travelled

at night in clear weather. A few years ago a notable incident occurred which

was almost taken for a miracle: a girl's girdle ﬂashed when it was moved or

rubbed a little; this may have been caused by the alum or salts with which

the girdle had been soaked forming a thick coat on it which became

crusted, and being broken by the rubbing. It is also certain that all sugar,

whether reﬁned (as they say) or raw, provided it is quite hard, sparkles

when broken or scraped with a knife in the dark. Similarly salt seawater is

sometimes found to sparkle at night when forcefully struck by oars. And in

storms highly agitated sea foam gives oﬀ a ﬂash; the Spanish call this ﬂash

the lung of the sea. There has not been enough investigation of how much

heat is given oﬀ by the ﬂame which sailors in the ancient world called Castor

and Pollux and today is called St Elmo's Fire.

. to the th. Everything which has been burned so that it turns to a ﬁery

red is always hot even without ﬂame, and no negative is attached to this

aﬃrmative. The closest thing [to a negative instance] seems to be rotten

wood, which shines at night but is not found to be hot, and the rotting

scales of ﬁsh, which also shine at night but are not found to be hot to the

touch. Nor is the body of the glow-worm or of the ﬂy which they call ‘ﬁre-

ﬂy' found to be hot to the touch.

. to the th. There has not been enough investigation of the locations

and nature of the earth from which hot springs ﬂow; so no negative is

attached.

. to the th. The negative attached to hot liquids is liquid itself in its

own nature. For no tangible liquid is found which is hot in its nature and

constantly stays hot; rather heat is superinduced for a time only as an

adventitious nature. Hence liquids that are the hottest in their power and

operation, like spirit of wine, chemical oil of spices, and oil of vitriol and

of sulphur, and suchlike, which quickly cause burning, are cold at ﬁrst

touch. And when water from hot springs is collected in a pitcher and taken

away from the springs, it cools down, just like water heated by ﬁre. Oily

substances, it is true, are less cold to the touch than watery substances, as

oil is less cold than water and silk less cold than linen. But this belongs to

the table of Degrees of Cold.

. to the th. Similarly the negative attached to hot steam is the nature

of steam itself as we experience it. Emissions from oily substances, though

readily inﬂammable, are not found to be hot unless just emitted from a hot

body.



The New Organon

. to the th. Just so the negative attached to hot air is the nature of air

itself. For we do not experience air as hot unless it has been conﬁned or sub-

jected to friction or obviously heated by the sun's ﬁre or some other hot body.

. to the th. The negative attached is periods which are colder than

normal at that season, which occur among us when the East or the North

winds are blowing; just as the opposite kind of weather occurs when the

South and West winds are blowing. A tendency to rain (especially in

winter) goes along with warm weather, and frost with cold weather.

. to the th. The attached negative instance is air conﬁned in caves in

summertime. But an altogether more thorough investigation is needed of

conﬁned air. For ﬁrst there is a reasonable doubt as to the nature of air in

relation to heat and cold in its own proper nature. For air obviously receives

heat from the inﬂuence of the heavenly bodies; and cold perhaps by

emission from the earth; and in what they call the middle region of the air,

from cold fogs and snow; so that no judgement can be made of the nature

of air from air which is outside and in the open, but might be made more

accurately from conﬁned air. And it also necessary for the air to be conﬁned

in a jar and in material which neither aﬀects the air with heat or cold of its

own, nor easily admits the inﬂuence of air from outside. Let the experiment

be made therefore with an earthenware jar wrapped in several layers of

leather to protect it from the outside air, sealing it well and keeping the air

in it for three or four days; take the reading after opening the jar, either by

hand or by carefully applying a thermometer.

. to the th. Similarly, there is some doubt whether the heat in wool,

skins, feathers and so on comes from a feeble heat inhering in them because

they have been stripped from animals; or also because of a certain fattiness

and oiliness, which is of a nature akin to warmth; or simply because air

is conﬁned and cut oﬀ, as described in the preceding paragraph. For all

air cut oﬀ from contact with the outside air seems to have some warmth.

So let an experiment be made on ﬁbrous material made from ﬂax, not on

wool, feathers or silk, which are stripped from animals. Notice too

that every kind of dust (which obviously traps air) is less cold than the

corresponding whole bodies from which the dust came; just as we also

suppose that spray of any kind (since it contains air) is less cold than the

actual liquid.

. to the th. This has no negative attached. For we ﬁnd nothing either

tangible or spirituous which does not take on heat when brought close to

ﬁre. These things do however diﬀer from each other in that some absorb



Book II

heat quickly, like air, oil and water, while others do so more slowly, like

stone and metals. But this belongs to the Table of Degrees.

. to the th. There is only one negative attached here: notice that

sparks are only struck from ﬂint, steel or any other hard substance when

minute fragments of stone or metal are struck oﬀ from the substance itself,

and air subjected to friction never generates sparks of itself, as is commonly

thought. Moreover the sparks themselves shoot downwards rather than up,

because of the weight of the body ignited, and when extinguished turn back

into a sooty substance.

. to the th. We believe there is no negative attached to this instance.

For we ﬁnd no tangible body which does not manifestly grow warm by

rubbing; so that the ancients imagined that there was no other means or

virtue of heating in the heavenly bodies than from the friction of the air by

rapid and intense rotation. We must ask a further question on this subject:

do bodies ejected from machines (as balls from cannons) acquire some

heat from the blast itself; so that they are found to be quite hot when they

fall? Air in motion rather cools than heats, as in winds, bellows and the

expulsion of air through pursed lips. But motion of this kind is not rapid

enough to cause heat, and acts according to the whole, not by particles, so

that it is no wonder if it does not generate heat.

. to the th. A more careful inquiry needs to be made of this instance.

For herbs and vegetables when green and moist seem to have some hidden

heat in themselves. This heat is so slight that it is not perceptible to touch in

an individual instance. But when they have been put together and conﬁned,

so that their spirit does not escape into the air but nurtures itself, then indeed

a noticeable heat arises, and sometimes a ﬁre if the material is suitable.

. to the th. We must also make a more thorough investigation of this

instance. For quicklime sprinkled with water seems to generate heat either

because of the concentration of heat previously dispersed (as we said above

about stored herbs), or because the ﬁery spirit is irritated and angered by

the water, and some kind of struggle and rejection of the contrary nature

takes place16. It will readily be apparent which of these it is if we use oil

instead of water; for the oil will have the same eﬀect as water in forming a

union with the enclosed spirit, but not in irritating it. Wider experiment

should also be made with the ashes and limes of diﬀerent bodies as well as

by dropping diﬀerent liquids on them.

16 For antiperistasis (rejection of the contrary nature) see . (towards the end).



The New Organon

. to the th. Attached to this instance is the negative instance of other

metals which are softer and more soluble. For goldleaf dissolved into a

liquid by means of aqua regis oﬀers no heat to the touch in its dissolving;

nor likewise does lead in aqua fortis, nor quicksilver either (as I recall). But

silver itself causes a little heat and so does copper (as I recall), and so more

obviously do tin and, particularly, iron and steel, which give oﬀ not only a

ﬁerce heat on dissolving but also violent bubbling. Therefore the heat

seems to be caused by the conﬂict when the strong waters penetrate, pit

and disintegrate the parts of the body, and the bodies themselves resist. But

when the bodies easily give in, hardly any heat is generated.

. to the th. There is no negative attached to the heat of animals,

except of insects (as remarked) because of the small size of their bodies. For

in ﬁsh, as compared with land animals, it is more a matter of degree of

heat than of its absence. In vegetables and plants no degree of heat is per-

ceptible to the touch, neither in their resin nor in uncovered pith. But in

animals a great range of heat is found, both in their parts (for the amounts

of heat around the heart, in the brain and around the external parts are all

diﬀerent), and in their occasional states, as in violent exercise and fevers.

. to the st. There is hardly any negative to this instance. Even animal

excrement which is not fresh has potential heat, as is seen by its fertilisa-

tion of the soil.

. to the nd and rd. Liquids (whether denominated waters or oils)

which have a high and intense acidity act like heat in tearing bodies apart

and eventually burning them, but they are not hot to the touch of a hand

at the beginning. They operate by aﬃnity and according to the porosity of

the body to which they are attached. For aqua regis dissolves gold, but not

silver; on the other hand aqua fortis dissolves silver, but not gold; and

neither dissolves glass. And so with the rest.

. to the th. Make an experiment with spirit of wine on wood and also

on butter, wax or pitch, to see whether it dissolves them by its heat.

Instance  shows its power of imitating heat in producing incrustations.

Let a similar experiment be made for liquefactions. Also experiment with

a thermometer or calendar glass17 shaped into a hollow bowl at the top;

pour into the hollow bowl some well-distilled spirit of wine, put a lid on it

to help keep its heat in; and note whether it makes the water go down by its

heat.

17 vitrum graduum sive calendare. (The term ‘calendar glass' is borrowed from Ellis.)



Book II

. to the th. Spices and herbs which are bitter to the palate, and even

sharper when swallowed, feel hot. We must therefore see in what other

materials they have the eﬀect of heat. Sailors tell us that when heaps and

piles of spices are suddenly opened after being long shut up, there is a

danger to those who ﬁrst disturb them and take them out, from fevers and

inﬂammations of the spirit. Similarly, an experiment can be made whether

the powders from spices or herbs of this kind do not dry bacon and meat

hung over them like the smoke from a ﬁre.

. to the th. There is a biting and penetrative power both in cold

things, such as vinegar and oil of vitriol, and in hot things such as oil of

marjoram and suchlike. And they equally cause pain in living things, and

non-living things they pull to pieces and eat away. There is no attached

negative instance. In animate beings there is no feeling of pain without a

sensation of heat.

. to the th. Several actions of heat and cold are the same, though they

work in a quite diﬀerent way. For snow too seems to burn the hands of boys

quite quickly; and cold keeps meat from going oﬀ no less than ﬁre; and heat

contracts bodies as cold also does. But it is more appropriate to deal with

these and similar questions in the Investigation of Cold.

XIII

Thirdly, we must make a presentation to the intellect of instances in which

the nature under investigation exists to a certain degree. This may be done

by comparing the increase and decrease in the same subject, or by com-

paring diﬀerent subjects with another. For the form of a thing is the very

thing itself; and a thing does not diﬀer from its form other than as apparent

and actual diﬀer, or exterior and interior, or the way it appears to us and the

way it is in reality; and therefore it quite surely follows that a nature is not

accepted as a true form unless it always decreases when the nature itself

decreases, and likewise always increases when the nature itself increases.

We have chosen to call such a table a Table of Degrees or Table of Comparison.

[Table 3]

Table of Degrees or Comparison on Heat

First then we will speak of things which have absolutely no degree of heat

to the touch, but seem to have only a kind of potential heat, a disposition



The New Organon

towards heat, or susceptibility to heat. Then we will move to things which

are actually hot or hot to the touch, and their strengths and degrees.

. Among solid and tangible bodies none is found that is hot in its nature

originally. No stone, metal, sulphur, fossil, wood, water or animal corpse

is found to be hot. The hot waters in natural baths seem to be heated by

accident, whether by an underground ﬂame or ﬁre such as spews out of

Etna and a number of other mountains, or from conﬂict between bodies in

the way heat is produced in the solution of iron and tin. And so to the

human touch, the degree of heat in inanimate objects is nil; and yet they do

diﬀer in degree of cold; for wood and metal are not equally cold. But this

belongs to the Table of Degrees on Cold.

. Nevertheless so far as potential heat and readiness to take ﬁre is

concerned, quite a few inanimate things are found which are extremely

susceptible to heat, such as sulphur, naphtha and petroleum.

. Things that have been hot before retain some latent relics of their

former heat, as horse dung retains the heat of the animal, and lime, or

perhaps ash or soot, the heat of the ﬁre. Thus bodies buried in horse

dung exude certain ﬂuids and disintegrate, and heat is roused in lime by

sprinkling water on it, as I have explained before.

. Among vegetables no plant or part of a plant ( as resin or pith) is found

which is hot to human touch. Nevertheless (as said above) stored green

herbs do grow warm; and some vegetables are found to be hot, others cold,

to the interior touch, e.g. to the palate or stomach, or even to exterior parts

after a certain time (as in the case of poultices and ointments).

. Nothing hot to human touch is found in the parts of animals after they

have died or been separated from the body. Even horse dung loses its heat

unless shut in and buried. However, all dung seems to have potential heat,

as in fertilising the ﬁelds. And similarly corpses of animals have a latent and

potential heat of this kind; so that in cemeteries where burials occur every

day, the earth acquires a kind of hidden heat which consumes a recently

buried body much more quickly than fresh earth. There is a story that

a kind of ﬁne, soft cloth is found among Orientals which is made from

the plumage of birds, and has an innate power to dissolve and liquefy the

butter which is loosely wrapped in it.

. Things which fertilise the ﬁelds, as dung of all kinds, chalk, sand from

the sea, salt and suchlike have some inclination to heat.

. All rotting has some traces of a weak heat in it, though not to the extent

that it can be felt by touch. For things like ﬂesh and cheese, which rot and



Book II

dissolve into little creatures, are not felt as hot to the touch; nor is rotten

wood that shines at night, found to be hot to the touch. However, heat in

rotting things sometimes shows itself by strong, vile smells.

. Thus the ﬁrst degree of heat, from things which are felt as hot to

human touch, seems to be that of animals, which has quite a wide range of

degrees. For the lowest degree (as in insects) is barely perceptible to touch;

the highest degree scarcely reaches the degree of heat of the sun's rays in

the hottest regions and seasons, and is not too ﬁerce to be tolerated by the

hand. And yet they say of Constantius and of some others who were of very

dry constitution and bodily condition, that when they were in the grip of

highly acute fevers, they almost seemed to burn the hand that touched

them.

. Animals increase in heat from movement and exercise, from wine and

eating, from sex, from burning fevers and from pain.

. At the onset of intermittent fevers, animals at ﬁrst are seized by cold

and shivering, but soon become exceedingly hot; as they also do right from

the beginning in the case of burning and pestilential fevers.

. We should make further investigation of the comparative heat in

diﬀerent animals, as in ﬁsh, quadrupeds, snakes and birds; and also by

species, as lion, kite, man etc.; for in the common belief ﬁsh are quite cool

internally, whereas birds are very hot, especially doves, hawks and sparrows.

. We should make further investigation of comparative heat in the

same animal, in its diﬀerent organs and limbs. For milk, blood, sperm and

eggs are found to be moderately warm, and less so than the exterior ﬂesh

of the animal when it is moving or agitated. Likewise no one has yet

inquired into the degree of heat in the brain, stomach, heart and so on.

. In winter and cold weather all animals are cold externally; but inter-

nally they are thought to be even warmer than usual.

. Even in the hottest part of the world and at the hottest times of the

year and the day, the heat of the heavenly bodies does not reach a suﬃcient

level to burn or scorch the driest wood or straw or even tinder, unless it is

intensiﬁed by burning-glasses; and yet it can raise a steam from damp

matter.

. The received wisdom of the astronomers makes some stars hotter

and some cooler. Mars is said to be the hottest after the sun, then Jupiter,

then Venus; the moon is said to be cold and Saturn coldest of all. Among

the ﬁxed stars Sirius is said to be hottest, then the Heart of the Lion, or

Regulus, then the Dog-star, etc.



The New Organon

. The sun has more warming power the nearer it approaches the

perpendicular, or Zenith, as we should also expect of the other planets in

their diﬀerent degrees of heat; for example, that Jupiter is more warming

for us when it lies beneath the Crab or the Lion than when it is beneath

Capricorn or Aquarius.

. We should also expect that the sun itself and the other planets have

more warming power at their perigees, because of their proximity to the

earth, than at their apogees. And if it should happen that in any region the

sun was both at its perigee and close to the perpendicular at the same time,

it would necessarily have more warming power than in a region where it

was at its perigee but shining more obliquely. Hence we need to make a

comparative study of the heights of the planets with regard to their close-

ness to the perpendicular and their obliquity, for each diﬀerent region.

. The sun, and the other planets likewise, are also thought to have

more warming power when they are in proximity to the major ﬁxed stars;

as when the sun lies in Leo it is nearer to the Cor Leonis, the Cauda Leonis,

the Spica Virginis and Sirius and the Dog-star, than when it lies in Cancer,

where however it is more towards the perpendicular. And we have to

believe that some parts of the sky give oﬀ more heat (though imperceptible

to touch) because they are furnished with more stars, particularly the larger

ones.

. In general the heat of heavenly bodies is increased in three ways: viz.

by perpendicularity, from propinquity or perigee, and from a constellation

or company of stars.

. In general the heat of animals and also of the heavenly rays (as they

reach us) is very diﬀerent from even the gentlest ﬂame or burning objects,

and also from liquids or air itself when strongly heated by ﬁre. For the ﬂame

of spirit of wine, even in a natural, unfocused form, is still able to set ﬁre to

straw or linen or paper; which the heat of an animal or of the sun will never

do without burning-glasses.

. In ﬂames and burning objects there are very many degrees of

strength and weakness of heat, but no careful inquiry has been made about

them, and so we must deal with them superﬁcially. The ﬂame from spirit

of wine seems to be the gentlest of ﬂames; unless perhaps ignis fatuus or

ﬂames or ﬂashes from the sweat of animals are gentler. We believe that the

next ﬂame is that from light and porous plant matter, like straw, rushes and

dry leaves, and the ﬂame from hairs or feathers is not much diﬀerent. Next

perhaps is the ﬂame from wood, especially the kinds of wood without much



Book II

resin or pitch, bearing in mind that the ﬂame from less hefty sticks (which

are usually bound into bundles) is smoother than that from trunks and

roots of trees. This may be commonly experienced in furnaces that smelt

iron, in which the ﬁre from ﬁrewood and branches of trees is not very

useful. Next comes (as we think) the ﬂame from oil, tallow, wax and

similar fatty substances which do not have much bite. The most powerful

heat is found in pitch and resin, and still more in sulphur, camphor,

naphtha, saltpetre and salts (after the crude matter has blown away), and

in their compounds, like gunpowder, Greek ﬁre (which is commonly called

wildﬁre) and its diﬀerent kinds, whose heat is so stubborn it is not easily

extinguished by water.

. We also think that the ﬂame which comes from some imperfect

metals is very strong and ﬁerce. But all these things need further inquiry.

. The ﬂame of forked lightning seems to surpass all these ﬂames; so

that it has sometimes melted wrought iron itself into drops, which those

other ﬂames cannot do.

. There are diﬀerent degrees of heat also in bodies that have been set

on ﬁre. No careful investigation has been made of this either. We believe

that the weakest is given oﬀ by burning tinder, such as we use to start a ﬁre;

and the same for the ﬂame from the porous wood or dry cords which are

used for ﬁring cannon. Next to this is burning coal from logs and coal, and

also from ﬁred bricks and suchlike. Of ﬁred substances we think that ﬁred

metals (iron, copper and so on) have the ﬁercest heat. But this too needs

further investigation.

. Some ﬁred things are found to be far hotter than some ﬂames. For

example, ﬁred iron is much hotter and more destructive than the ﬂame of

spirit of wine.

. Many things too which without being on ﬁre are simply heated by

ﬁre, like boiling water and air conﬁned in reverse furnaces, are found to

surpass in heat many kinds of ﬂame and burning substances.

. Motion increases heat, as one can see in the case of bellows and blasts

of breath; so that the harder metals are not dissolved or melted by a dead

or quiet ﬁre but only if it is rekindled by blowing.

. Try an experiment with burning-glasses in which (as I recall) the

following happens: if a burning-glass is placed (for example) at a distance

of a span18 from a combustible object, it does not burn or consume as much

18 A span is nine inches.



The New Organon

as if it is placed at a distance of (for example) a half-span, and is slowly and

by degrees withdrawn to the distance of a span. The cone and the focus of

the rays are the same, but the actual motion intensiﬁes the eﬀect of the heat.

. Fires occurring when a strong wind is blowing are thought to

advance further against the wind than with the wind; this is because the

ﬂame leaps back with a swifter motion when the wind drops than it

advances when the wind is pushing it forward.

. A ﬂame does not shoot out or start up unless there is an empty space

in which it may move and play; except in the blasting ﬂames of gunpowder

and suchlike, where the compression and conﬁnement of the ﬂame intensi-

ﬁes its fury.

. The anvil is much heated by the hammer; so that if an anvil were

made of a thinnish sheet of metal, we would think it could be made to glow

like ﬁred iron under continued blows from a hammer; but the experiment

should be tried.

. In burning porous substances in which there is space for the ﬁre to

move, it is instantly extinguished if its motion is suppressed by strong com-

pression, as when tinder or the burning wick of a candle or lamp or even a

burning coal or lump of charcoal is snuﬀed out with an extinguisher or

ground under foot, or suchlike, the activity of the ﬁre immediately stops.

. Being brought close to a warm body increases heat according to the

degree of closeness; this also happens in the case of light; the closer an

object is brought to light the more visible it is.

. A combination of diﬀerent heats increases heat unless there is a

mixture of substances; for a big ﬁre and a small ﬁre in the same place

increase each other's heat to some degree; but warm water poured into

boiling water cools.

. The duration of a hot body increases heat. For heat is constantly

coming out and passing over and mixing with the preexisting heat, so that

it multiplies the heat. A ﬁre does not warm a room as much in half an hour

as it does in the course of a whole day. This is not the case with light, for a

lamp or a candle in a given spot gives no more light after a long time than

it did right at the beginning.

. Irritation by ambient cold increases heat; as one may see in the case

of ﬁres in bitter cold. We think that this occurs not so much because the

heat is conﬁned and contracted (which is a kind of union), but because it is

exasperated, as when air or a cane is violently compressed or bent, it does

not spring back to its former point but goes beyond it to the other side.



Book II

Make a careful experiment with a cane or something like that; put it into a

ﬂame, and see whether it is not burned more rapidly at the edge of the ﬂame

than in the centre.

. There are several degrees of susceptibility to heat. First of all, note

how even a little, weak heat alters and slightly warms things that are the

least susceptible to heat. Even the heat of the hand gives some warmth

to a small ball of lead or any metal held for just a short time. So easily is

heat transmitted and aroused, and it happens in all substances without

apparent change to any of them.

. The readiest of all substances in our experience to take up and to lose

heat is air. This is best seen in thermometers.19 You make them as follows.

Take a glass bottle with a rounded belly and a narrow, elongated neck; turn

such a bottle upside down and insert it, mouth down, belly up, in another

glass vessel which contains water, allowing the bottom of the receiving

vessel to just touch the rim of the inserted bottle, and let the neck of the

inserted bottle lie on the mouth of the receiving vessel and be supported by

it; to do this more easily, place a little wax on the mouth of the receiving

vessel; but do not completely seal up the mouth, lest a lack of incoming air

should impede the movement we are to speak of; for it is a very light and

delicate movement.

The upturned bottle, before being inserted in the other, should be

warmed at a ﬂame from above, i.e. on its belly. After the bottle has been

placed there, as we said, the air (which had expanded because it was

warmed) will withdraw and contract after the time it takes for the applied

heat to be lost, to the extension or dimension which the ambient or outside

air had at the time when the bottle was inserted, and will draw the water

up to this extent. A long, narrow paper should be attached, marked with

degrees (as many as you like). You will also observe, as the temperature of

the day rises or falls, that the air contracts into a smaller space because of

cold and expands into a wider area because of heat. This will be shown by

the water rising when the air contracts and going down, or being forced

down, when the air expands. The sensitivity of the air to cold and heat is

so subtle and sensitive that it far surpasses the sensitivity of human touch;

and a ray of sun or the warmth of a breath, to say nothing of the heat of a

hand, placed over the top of the bottle, instantly sends the water down in a

noticeable manner. We believe that animal spirit has a still more exquisite

19 vitrum calendare



The New Organon

sense of heat and cold, but is dulled and obstructed by the mass of the

body.

. Most sensitive to heat after air, we think, are bodies which have been

newly altered and compressed by cold, like snow and ice; for they begin to

melt and thaw with just a gentle heat. After them, perhaps, quicksilver.

Then come fatty substances, like oil, butter and so on; then wood; then

water; ﬁnally stones and metals which are not easily warmed, especially

internally. Once they have taken heat, however, they do retain it for a very

long time; so that brick, stone or iron, once ﬁred up and plunged and sub-

merged in a basin of cold water, retains so much heat that it cannot be

touched for (more or less) a quarter of an hour.

. The less the mass of a body, the more quickly it warms up when

placed next to a warm body; this shows that all heat in our experience is

somehow opposed to tangible body.

. To the senses and to human touch heat is a variable and relative

thing; so that tepid water feels hot to a hand in the grip of cold, but if the

hand warms up, it feels cold.

XIV

Anyone may easily see how poor our history is, since we are often com-

pelled to make use in the above tables of the words ‘do an experiment', or

‘investigate further'; to say nothing of the fact that in place of proven

history and reliable instances we insert traditions and tales (though not

without noting their dubious authenticity and authority).

XV

We have chosen to call the task and function of these three tables the

Presentation of instances to the intellect. After the presentation has been made,

induction itself has to be put to work. For in addition to the presentation of

each and every instance, we have to discover which nature appears con-

stantly with a given nature or not, which grows with it or decreases with it;

and which is a limitation (as we said above) of a more general nature. If the

mind attempts to do this aﬃrmatively from the beginning20 (as it always

does if left to itself), fancies will arise and conjectures and poorly deﬁned

20 Cf. ., .



Book II

notions and axioms needing daily correction, unless one chooses (in the

manner of the Schoolmen) to defend the indefensible. And they will doubt-

less be better or worse according to the ability and strength of the intellect

at work. And yet it belongs to God alone (the creator and artiﬁcer of forms),

or perhaps to angels and intelligences, to have direct knowledge of forms

by aﬃrmation, and from the outset of their thought. It is certainly beyond

man, who may proceed at ﬁrst only through negatives and, after making

every kind of exclusion, may arrive at aﬃrmatives only at the end.

XVI

Therefore we must make a complete analysis and separation of a nature,

not by ﬁre but with the mind, which is a kind of divine ﬁre. The ﬁrst task

of true induction is the rejection or exclusion of singular natures which are

not found in an instance in which the given nature is present; or which are

found in an instance where the given nature is missing; or are found to

increase in an instance where the given nature decreases; or to decrease

when the given nature increases. Only when the rejection and exclusion has

been performed in proper fashion will there remain (at the bottom of the

ﬂask, so to speak) an aﬃrmative form, solid, true and well-deﬁned (the

volatile opinions having now vanished into smoke). This takes no time to

say, but there are many twists and turns before one gets there. But we will

hopefully leave out nothing that leads to this end.

XVII

When we seem to assign such an important role to forms, we must care-

fully caution and constantly warn, in case what we say is wrongly taken as

referring to the kind of forms which have hitherto been familiar to men's

thoughts and contemplations.21

First, we are not speaking at present of composite forms, which are

(as we said) conjunctions of simple natures, in the common way of things,

like lion, eagle, rose, gold and so on. It will be appropriate to deal with

them when we get to latent processes and latent structures, and the un-

covering of them as they are found in substances (so-called) or compound

natures.

21 Cf. ., .



The New Organon

Again, what we have said should not be understood (even as far as

simple natures are concerned) of abstract forms and ideas, which are

not deﬁned in matter or poorly deﬁned. When we speak of forms, we

mean simply those laws and limitations of pure act which organise and

constitute a simple nature, like heat, light or weight, in every kind of

susceptible material and subject. The form of heat therefore or the form of

light is the same thing as the law of heat or the law of light, and we never

abstract or withdraw from things themselves and the operative side. And

so when we say (for example) in the inquiry into the form of heat, Reject

rarity, or, rarity is not of the form of heat, it is the same as if we said, Man can

superinduce heat on a dense body, or on the other hand, Man can take away

heat or bar it from a rare body.

Our forms too may seem to someone to have something abstract about

them, because they mix and combine heterogeneous elements (for the heat

of heavenly bodies and the heat of ﬁre seem to be very heterogeneous; the

redness in a rose or such like is very diﬀerent from that appearing in a

rainbow or in the rays of an opal or diamond; and so are death by drown-

ing, by burning, by a sword thrust, by a stroke and by starvation, and yet

they are similar in having the nature of heat, redness and death). Anyone

who thinks so should realise that his mind is captive and in thrall to habit,

the surface appearance of things, and to opinions. For it is quite certain that

however heterogeneous and foreign, they are similar in the form or law

which deﬁnes heat or redness or death; and human power cannot be freed

and liberated from the common course of nature, and opened up and raised

to new eﬀectiveness and new ways of operating, except by the uncovering

and discovery of such forms. After this union of nature, which is absolutely

the principal thing, we will speak later, in their place, of the divisions and

veins of nature, both the ordinary divisions and those which are internal

and more true.

XVIII

And now we must give an example of the exclusion or rejection of natures

which are found by the tables of presentation not to belong to the form of

heat; remarking in passing that not only are individual tables suﬃcient to

reject a nature, but so is every one of the individual instances contained in

them. For it is obvious from what I have said that every contradictory

instance destroys a conjecture about a form. We do sometimes however



Book II

provide two or three instances of an exclusion, for the sake of clarity, and

to show more fully how the tables are to be used.

Example of exclusion or rejection of natures from the form of heat:

. By the rays of the sun, reject elemental nature.

. By ordinary ﬁre, and particularly underground ﬁres (which are

furthest away and least aﬀected by rays from the heavens), reject heavenly

nature.

. By the fact that bodies of all kinds (i.e. of minerals, vegetables, the

external parts of animals, of water, oil, air and so on) are warmed by simply

getting near to a ﬁre or other warm body, reject variation or more or less

subtle textures in bodies.

. By heated iron and metals, which warm other bodies but are no way

diminished in weight or substance, reject the attachment or admixture of

the substance of another hot body.

. By boiling water and air, and also by metals and other solids which

have been warmed but not to the point of catching ﬁre or redness, reject

light and brightness.

. By the rays of the moon and other stars (except the sun), again reject

light and brightness.

. By comparison with burning iron and the ﬂame of spirit of wine (of

which heated iron has more heat and less light, the ﬂame of spirit of wine

has more light and less heat), once again reject brightness and light.

. By heated gold and other metals, which have the densest mass in the

whole, reject rarity.

rarity.

. By air, which remains rare, however cold it gets, once more reject

. By heated iron, which does not increase in size, but keeps the same

visible dimension, reject local or expansive movement in the whole.

. By the swelling of air in thermometers and the like, which moves in

space and obviously in an expanding manner, and yet does not acquire

obvious increase in heat, once again reject local movement or expansive

movement in the whole.

. By the easy warming of all bodies without any destruction or notice-

able alteration, reject destructive nature or the violent addition of any new

nature.

. By the agreement and conformity of similar eﬀects displayed by

both heat and cold, reject both expanding and contracting motion in the

whole.



The New Organon

. By the generation of heat from rubbing bodies together, reject

fundamental nature. By fundamental nature we mean one which is found

existing in a nature and is not caused by a preceding nature.

There are also other natures; we are not composing complete tables, but

only examples.

Not a single one of the natures listed comes from the form of heat. One

need not be concerned with any of the natures listed in an operation on

heat.

XIX

True induction is founded on exclusion, but is not completed until it reaches

an aﬃrmation. In fact an exclusion itself is not in any way complete, and

cannot be so at the beginning. For exclusion, quite obviously, is the rejection

of simple natures. But if we do not yet have good, true notions of simple

natures, how can an exclusion be justiﬁed? Some of the notions we have

mentioned are vague and poorly deﬁned (e.g. the notion of an elementary

nature, the notion of a heavenly nature, the notion of rarity). We recognise

and always keep in mind how large a task we are undertaking (to make the

human intellect equal to things and to nature) and therefore do not stop at

the present stage of our teaching. We go further, and devise and provide

more powerful aids for the use of the intellect; and these we now set out. In

the interpretation of nature, surely, the mind has to be formed and prepared

to be content with an appropriate degree of certainty, and yet to recognise

(especially at the beginning) that what is before us depends heavily on what

is to come.

XX

And yet because truth emerges more quickly from error than from con-

fusion, we believe it is useful to give the intellect permission, after it has

compiled and considered three tables of ﬁrst presentation (as we have done),

to get ready to try an interpretation of nature in the aﬃrmative on the basis

of the instances in the tables and of instances occurring elsewhere. We have

chosen to call such a ﬁrst attempt an authorisation of the intellect, or a ﬁrst

approach to an interpretation, or a ﬁrst harvest.



Book II

A ﬁrst harvest of the form of heat

Notice (as is quite clear from what I have said) that the form of a thing is in

each and every one of the instances in which the thing itself is; otherwise it

would not be a form: and therefore there can be absolutely no contradictory

instance. And yet the form is much more obvious and evident in some

instances than in others, namely in the instances where the nature of the

form is less checked, obstructed and limited by other natures. We have

chosen to call such instances conspicuous or revealing instances.22 Let us

proceed then to the actual ﬁrst harvest of the form of heat.

In each and every instance, the nature of which heat is a limitation

seems to be motion. This is most apparent in a ﬂame, which is always

in motion; and in boiling or bubbling liquids, which are also always in

motion. It appears also in the intensifying or increase of heat produced

by motion; as by bellows and winds (see Instances  of Table ). And

similarly with motion of other kinds (see Instance  and  of Table ).

It is apparent once more in the extinction of ﬁre and heat by any power-

ful compression which puts the brake on motion and makes it cease

(see Instances  and  of Table ). It is also apparent in the fact that

every body is destroyed or at least signiﬁcantly altered by any ﬁre or

strong and powerful heat; hence it is quite obvious that in the internal

parts of a body, heat causes tumult, agitation and ﬁerce motion which

gradually brings it to dissolution.

What we have said about motion (i.e. that it is like a genus in relation to

heat) should not be taken to mean that heat generates motion or that

motion generates heat (though both are true in some cases), but that actual

heat itself, or the quiddity of heat, is motion and nothing else; limited how-

ever by the diﬀerences which we shall lay out shortly, after adding some

caveats to avoid ambiguity.

Heat as felt is a relative thing, and is not universal but relative to each

individual; and it is rightly regarded as merely the eﬀect of heat on the

animal spirit. Further it is in itself a variable thing, since the same object

gives rise to a perception of both heat and cold (according to the condition

of the senses), as is clear from Instance  of Table .

The form of heat should not be confused with the communication of

22 See ..



The New Organon

heat or its conductive nature, by which one body is warmed by contact with

another body which is hot. Heat is diﬀerent from warming. Heat is produced

by a movement of rubbing without any preceding heat, and this excludes

warming from the form of heat. Even when heat is produced by closeness

to heat, the eﬀect is not due to the form of heat but depends wholly on

a higher and more common nature, viz. on the nature of assimilation or

multiplication, which requires a separate investigation.

Fire is a popular notion without value: it is made up of a union of heat

and light in a body, as in an ordinary ﬂame, and in bodies heated till they

are red.

Having removed all ambiguity, we must now come at last to the true

diﬀerences which limit motion and constitute it as the form of heat.

The ﬁrst diﬀerence is that heat is an expansive motion, by which a body

seeks to dilate and move into a larger sphere or dimension than it had

previously occupied. This diﬀerence is most obvious in a ﬂame; here the

smoke or cloudy exhalation visibly broadens and opens out into a ﬂame.

It is also apparent in all boiling liquids, which visibly swell and rise

and give oﬀ bubbles; and it pursues the process of its own expansion

until it turns into a body which is far more extensive and broadened

than the liquid itself, i.e. into steam or smoke or air.

It is also apparent in wood and every kind of combustible thing,

where there is sometimes sweating and always evaporation.

It is also apparent in the melting of metals, which (being of highly

compact substance) do not easily swell and dilate; their spirit ﬁrst

dilates in itself and so conceives a desire for still greater dilation, then

visibly thrusts and forces the more solid parts into liquid form. If the

heat is still further intensiﬁed, it dissolves and turns much of it into a

volatile substance.

It is apparent also in iron or rocks; although they do not melt, they

are not fused, but they are softened. This also happens with sticks of

wood; they become ﬂexible when gently warmed in hot ashes.

But this motion is best seen in air, which under the inﬂuence of a

little heat dilates itself immediately and perceptibly; as by Instance 

of Table .

It is also apparent in the contrary nature, that of cold. For cold

contracts every substance and forcibly narrows it; so that in spells of

intense cold nails fall out of walls, bronze objects split, and glass which



Book II

has been warmed and then suddenly plunged into cold cracks

and breaks. Air similarly withdraws into a smaller space under the

inﬂuence of a little cooling; as by Instance  of Table . But we will

speak more fully of this in the inquiry on cold.

And it is no wonder if heat and cold exhibit several similar actions

(on which see Instance  of Table ), since two of the following

diﬀerences (of which we are about to speak) belong to both natures;

though in this diﬀerence (of which we are now speaking) the actions are

diametrically opposite. For heat gives an expansive, dilating motion,

and cold gives a contracting, shrinking movement.

The second diﬀerence is a variation of the ﬁrst; namely that heat is

an expansive motion, or motion towards a circumference, under the

condition that the body rises with it. For there is no doubt that there

are many mixed motions. For example, an arrow or a javelin rotates as

it ﬂies and ﬂies in rotating. Similarly too the motion of heat is both an

expansion and a movement upwards.

This diﬀerence is apparent in a pair of tongs or an iron poker put in

the ﬁre: because if you put it in upright holding it with your hand from

above, it quickly burns your hand; but if you put it in from the side or

from below, it is much slower to burn the hand.

It is conspicuous also in distillation by means of a retort, which is

used for delicate ﬂowers which easily lose their scent. Trial and error

has found that one should place the ﬂame above rather than beneath,

so as to burn less. For all heat, and not just a ﬂame, rises.

On this subject try an experiment with the contrary nature of cold,

as to whether cold does not contract a body by descending downwards

just as heat dilates a body by ascending upwards. Take two iron rods

or two glass tubes (in other respects equal) and heat them somewhat;

place a sponge full of cold water or snow under one and over the other.

Our view is that the cooling at its ends will be quicker in the rod with

the snow above it than in that with the snow beneath it; contrary to

what happens in the case of heat.

The third diﬀerence is that heat is a motion which is not uniformly

expansive throughout the whole of a body, but expansive through its

smaller particles, and is at once checked and repelled and bounced

about, so that it takes on a back-and-forth motion, always scurrying

about, and straining and struggling, angry at the beating it takes; hence

the fury of ﬁre and heat.



The New Organon

This diﬀerence is most apparent in a ﬂame and in boiling liquids;

which are incessantly agitated, swelling in small spots and subsiding

again.

It is also apparent in bodies which are so tough and compact that

they do not swell or gain in mass when they are heated or ﬁred; like

heated iron, in which the heat is very ﬁerce.

It is apparent also in a hearth ﬁre burning brightest in the coldest

weather.

It is also apparent in the fact that no heat is observable when air

expands in a calendar glass without obstacle or counter-pressure, i.e.

uniformly and equally. And no particular heat is observable in the

case of winds which have been shut up and then burst forth with

great violence; that is because the motion is of the whole without a

back-and-forth motion in the parts. Try an experiment on this,

whether a ﬂame does not burn more ﬁercely towards the edges than in

the middle.

It is apparent also in the fact that all burning passes through the

minute pores of the body on ﬁre; so that the burning pits, penetrates,

stabs and pricks like a thousand needle points. This is also the reason

why all strong waters (if akin to the body in which they act) have the

eﬀect of ﬁre because of their corrosive, piercing nature.

The diﬀerence of which we are now speaking is shared with the

nature of cold: in cold the contractive motion is checked by the

contrary pressure to expand, while in heat the expansive motion is

checked by the contrary pressure to contract.

Therefore whether they penetrate the parts of the body towards the

interior or towards the exterior, the explanation is the same, though their

strength is quite diﬀerent in the two cases. For we do not experience

on the surface of the earth anything exceedingly cold. See Instance 

of Table .

The fourth diﬀerence is a variation of the previous one. It is that

the motion of pricking and penetration must be quite rapid, not slow,

and takes place at the level of the particles, minute as they are; and

yet not the very smallest particles, but those which are somewhat

larger.

This diﬀerence is apparent from a comparison of the eﬀects which

ﬁre gives with those made by time or age. For age or time withers, con-

sumes, subverts and turns to dust no less than ﬁre; or rather much



Book II

more subtly. But because such motion is very slow and by very tiny

particles, no heat is observable.

It is apparent also in the comparison between the dissolution of iron

and of gold. Gold is dissolved without arousing heat, but iron with a

violent arousal of heat, though in a quite similar length of time. The

reason is that in gold the entrance of the separating liquid is gentle and

discreet, and the particles of gold yield easily; but in iron the entry is

rough and forcible and the particles of iron are more stubborn.

It is apparent also to some extent in some gangrenes and ﬂesh

rotting, which cause little heat or pain because the putrefaction is

delicate.

And this is the ﬁrst harvest or preliminary interpretation of the form of heat,

made by the leave given to the intellect.

On the basis of this ﬁrst harvest, the true form or deﬁnition of heat (of

heat as a universal notion, not relative merely to sense) is, in a nutshell, as

follows: heat is an expansive motion which is checked and struggling through

the particles. And expansion is qualiﬁed: while expanding in all directions

it has some tendency to rise. And the struggle through the particles is thus

qualiﬁed: it is not completely sluggish, but excited and with some force.

The thing is the same as far as operation is concerned. This is the sum

of it: If in any natural body you can arouse a motion to dilate or expand; and

if you can check that motion and turn it back on itself so that the dilation does

not proceed equally but partly succeeds and is partly checked, you will certainly

generate heat. It is irrelevant whether the body is elementary (so-called) or

imbued with heavenly substances; whether luminous or opaque; whether

rare or dense; whether spatially expanded or contained within the bounds of

its ﬁrst size; whether tending toward dissolution or in a steady state; whether

animal, vegetable or mineral, or water, oil or air, or any other substance

whatsoever which is capable of the motion described. Heat to the senses is

the same thing; but with the analogy that belongs to our senses. But now

we must proceed to other aids.

XXI

After the Tables of ﬁrst presentation, after rejection or exclusion, and after

making the ﬁrst harvest on the basis of them, we must proceed to the other

aids to the intellect in the interpretation of nature and in true and complete



The New Organon

induction. In setting them out we shall continue to use heat and cold when

we need tables, but where we want just a few examples, we shall make use

of any other examples, so that we may give a wider scope to our teaching

without confusing the inquiry.

We shall speak then in the ﬁrst place of privileged instances;23 secondly

of supports for induction; third of the reﬁnement of induction; fourth of the

adaptation of the investigation to the nature of the subject; ﬁfth of natures

which are privileged so far as investigation is concerned, or of which

inquiries we should make ﬁrst and which ones later; sixth of the limits of

investigation, or of a summary of all natures universally; seventh of deduc-

tion to practice, or of how it relates to man; eighth of preparations for investi-

gation; and ﬁnally of the ascending and descending scale of axioms.

XXII

Among privileged instances we shall ﬁrst bring forward solitary instances.24

Solitary instances are those which exhibit the nature under investigation in

subjects which have nothing in common with other subjects but that very

nature; or again which do not exhibit the nature under investigation, in

subjects which are similar in all things to other subjects except in that

nature. It is evident that instances of this kind cut out the rambling, and are

a quick route to conﬁrming an exclusion, so that a few of them are as good

as many.

For example: in an investigation of the nature of colour, prisms and

crystals, and also dew and such things, which make colours in themselves

and throw them outside themselves onto a wall, are solitary instances. For

they have nothing in common with the inherent colours in ﬂowers,

coloured gems, metals, woods etc., except colour itself. Hence it is easy

to infer that colour is nothing other than the modiﬁcation of a ray of

light admitted and received, in the ﬁrst case through diﬀerent degrees of

incidence, in the second through various textures and structures of body.

And these are solitary instances concerned with resemblance.

Again, in the same inquiry, distinct veins of black and white in marble,

and variations of colour in ﬂowers of the same species, are solitary instances.

23 praerogativae instantiarum: so named from the centuria praerogativa, the aristocratic section of the

comitia centuriata at Rome, which had the privilege of voting ﬁrst at meetings and of announcing its

vote before the other ‘centuries' voted; it thus indicated to the others which way to vote.

24 instantiae solitariae



Book II

For the white and the black in marble and the patches of red and white in

carnations agree in almost everything except the colour itself. Hence

the easy conclusion that colour does not have much in common with the

intrinsic natures of a body but lies only in the grosser, quasi-mechanical

positioning of the parts. And these are solitary instances concerned with

diﬀerence. We have chosen to call both kinds solitary instances; or wild

ones,25 a term taken from the astronomers.

XXIII

The privileged instances which we will put second are instances of transition.26

These are the instances in which the nature which we are looking for, if

previously non-existent, is in transition to being, and if already existing,

towards non-being. And therefore in both these opposite movements such

instances are always double; or rather it is one instance prolonged in its

motion or passage to the opposite point of the circle. Such instances are not

only a quick way to conﬁrm an exclusion, but also pin down the aﬃrmation,

or actual form, to a small area. For the form has to be something which is

introduced by one kind of transition or on the other hand removed and

annihilated by another kind. And though every exclusion encourages

an aﬃrmation, this is still achieved more directly in the same subject

than in diﬀerent subjects. And the form (as is abundantly clear from my

discussion) which reveals itself in the one case leads us on to all of them.

The simpler the transition, the more highly we should value the instance.

Again instances of transition are quite useful for the operative function; for

when they exhibit the form combined with the cause that makes it so

or prevents it from being so, they turn a bright light on an activity in

some things, from which it is also an easy transition to the next thing.

But there is a danger in them which requires a caution; they may bring

the form too close to the eﬃcient cause, and may soak, or at least dip, the

intellect in a false view of the form in relation to the eﬃcient cause. The

eﬃcient cause is always deﬁned as nothing other than the vehicle or bearer

of the form. There is an easy remedy to this problem in a properly

conducted exclusion.

We should now give an example of an instance of transition. Let the nature

to be sought be White or Whiteness; an instance in transition to produce

25 Reading ferales, as Ellis proposes.

26 instantiae migrantes



The New Organon

it is unbroken glass and powdered glass; also plain water and water stirred

to a foam. For unbroken glass and plain water are transparent, not white;

but powdered glass and foaming water are white, not transparent. And

so one has to ask what happened to the glass or the water as a result of the

transition. For it is obvious that the form of whiteness is imported and

introduced by the pounding of the glass and the stirring of the water.

Nothing else is found to have occurred but the fragmentation of the glass

and the water into little bits and the introduction of air. And it was no small

step towards the discovery of the form of whiteness that two bodies which

are in themselves transparent more or less (namely air and water, or air and

glass) exhibit whiteness as soon as they are made into minute fragments,

because of the unequal refraction of rays of light.

But on this question one should also give an example of the danger and

of the caution we mentioned. No doubt a mind which has been led astray

by that sort of eﬃcient cause will too easily conclude that air is always

necessary to the form of whiteness, or that whiteness is only generated by

transparent bodies; which are all completely false, and proven to be so by

many exclusions. In fact it will rather be apparent (setting aside air and

suchlike) that bodies which are quite even (in the parts of them that aﬀect

vision) yield transparency, while bodies which are unequal and of simple

texture yield whiteness; bodies which are unequal and of compound but

regular structure yield other colours except black; and bodies which are

unequal and of compound but altogether irregular and disorderly structure

yield black. And so an example has been given of an instance of transition

towards the generation of whiteness in a nature under investigation. An

instance of transition towards non-being in the same nature of whiteness is

disintegrating foam or melted snow. Water sheds whiteness and takes on

transparency after becoming whole without air.

Nor should we in any way fail to include among instances of transition not

only instances moving towards generation and passing away but also those

tending towards increase and diminution; since these too tend to reveal a

form, as is abundantly clear from the deﬁnition of a form given above and

the table of degrees. And thus there is an explanation analogous to that in

the instances given above, why paper, which when dry is white, is less white

when wetted (because of the exclusion of air and the reception of water)

and tends more towards transparency.



Book II

XXIV

As third of the privileged instances we shall put revealing instances,27 which

we have mentioned already in the ﬁrst harvest on Heat;28 we also call them

conspicuous instances or liberated or dominant instances. They are instances

which reveal the nature under investigation naked and independent, and

also at its height and in the supreme degree of its power; that is, liberated

and free of impediments, or at least prevailing over them by the strength of

its virtue, and suppressing and restraining them. Every body is susceptible

of many forms of combination and compounding of natures they dull,

depress, break and bind each other; and the individual forms are obscured.

But some subjects are found in which the nature under investigation stands

out from the others in its vigour, either because there are no obstacles or

because its virtue is dominant. Such instances are particularly revealing of

form. But even in these instances caution is necessary, and we have to

restrain the intellect's hastiness. We should be suspicious of anything that

obtrudes a form on us, and makes it leap out at us, so that it seems simply

to spring to mind; we must insist on a strict and careful exclusion.

For example: suppose the nature is heat. The revealing instance of

the motion of expansion, which (as I said above) is a thermometer of air.

While a ﬂame clearly shows expansion, it does not reveal the progress of

expansion, because of its immediate extinction. Boiling water also does not

reveal the expansion of water so well in its own body, because of the quick

conversion of water into steam and air. And red-hot iron and suchlike are

very far from revealing a progress; on the contrary, the suppression and

fragmentation of the spirit by its dense and compacted particles (which

tame and bridle the expansion) prevent the actual expansion from being

fully apparent to the senses. But a thermometer clearly reveals expansion

in air, and reveals it as conspicuous, progressive, enduring and not

transient.

For another example, suppose the sought nature is weight. The reveal-

ing instance of weight is quicksilver. It far exceeds everything in weight

except gold, which is slightly heavier. Quicksilver is a better instance than

gold for revealing weight; because gold is solid and compact, which seems

to be due to its density, whereas quicksilver is liquid and swelling with

spirit, and yet far exceeds diamond in weight and things which are taken

27 instantiae ostensivae

28 At ..



The New Organon

to be the most solid. This reveals that the form of heaviness or weight is

governed simply the amount of matter and not by how compact it is.

XXV

As ﬁfth of the privileged instances we put concealed instances,29 which we have

also chosen to call instances of the twilight. They are almost the opposite to

revealing instances. For they exhibit the nature under investigation at its

lowest strength, as if in its origins or earliest eﬀorts, tentative and trying

itself out, but concealed beneath a contrary nature and subdued by it. Yet

such instances are of the utmost importance for discovering forms, because

like revealing instances they easily lead to diﬀerences, so concealed instances

are the best guides to genera, that is, to those common natures of which the

natures under investigation are simply the limitations.

For example: suppose the sought nature under investigation is solidity or

the determinate, the opposite of which is the liquid or the ﬂuid. Concealed

instances are those which exhibit a very low and weak degree of solidity in

a ﬂuid, a bubble of water, for example, which is like a kind of solid and

determinate skin made of the substance of water. Similarly with dripping

water: if the water keeps on coming, it forms a thin thread so that the stream

of water is unbroken; but if there is not enough water to keep on coming, it

falls in round drops, which is the shape which best sustains the water against

breakup. But at the actual moment when it ceases to be a thread of water and

begins to fall in drops, the water itself leaps back up to avoid breaking. In

metals which in the molten state are liquid but very viscous, the molten

drops often leap back up and stay there. Much the same is true of children's

mirrors, which small children make from spittle on reeds; here too one sees

a solid ﬁlm of water. But this is exhibited much better in the other children's

game where they take water, make it a bit more viscous with soap and blow

it up through a hollow straw, and thus make the water into something like a

reservoir of bubbles; and through the admixture with air it takes on30 such

solidity that it may be tossed some distance into the air without breaking up.

This is best seen in foam and snow, which take on such solidity that they can

almost be cut; and yet both bodies are formed from air and water, which are

both liquids. All of which quite clearly indicates that liquid and solid

are mere vulgar notions adapted to the senses; that in reality there is in all

29 instantiae clandestinae

30 Reading induit for inducit.



Book II

bodies a tendency to avoid and evade breaking up; that this is weak and

feeble in homogeneous substances (which liquids are) but more lively and

powerful in bodies compounded of heterogeneous substances; the reason is

that the addition of heterogeneity unites bodies, while the entrance of the

homogeneous dissolves and disbands them.

Another example: suppose the nature under investigation is Attraction,

or the or the coming together of bodies. The most remarkable revealing

instance of its form is the magnet. The nature contrary to the attracting

nature is the non-attracting nature, even in the same substance. Iron, for

example, which does not attract iron, just as lead does not attract lead, nor

wood wood, nor water water. A concealed secret is a magnet armed with

iron, or rather iron in an armed magnet. Its nature is such that an armed

magnet does not attract iron at a distance more powerfully than an

unarmed magnet. But if the iron is brought near enough to touch the iron

in the armed magnet, then the armed magnet holds a much greater weight

of iron than a simple unarmed magnet, because of the similarity of substance,

iron against iron; this activity was completely concealed and latent in the

iron before the magnet approached. And thus it is clear that the form of

coming together is something which is lively and strong in the magnet,

weak and latent in the iron. Likewise it has been remarked that small

wooden arrows without iron tips shot from large carbines penetrate

wooden objects (e.g. the sides of ships, or suchlike) more deeply than the

same arrows tipped with iron, because of the similarity of the substances

(wood on wood), though this was previously hidden in the wood. Likewise,

though whole bodies of air do not obviously attract air or water water, yet

a bubble which touches another bubble more easily dissolves it than if there

were no second bubble, because of the inclination that water has to come

together with water, and air with air. Such Concealed Instances (which are

remarkably useful, as I have said) give the best glimpse of themselves in

small portions of substances. For larger masses of things follow more

universal and general forms, as will be explained in due course.

XXVI

As ﬁfth of the privileged instances we shall put constitutive instances;31 which

we have also chosen to call bundled instances. These are instances which

31 instantiae constitutivae



The New Organon

constitute one species of a nature under investigation as a Lesser Form.

Genuine forms (which are always convertible with the natures under

investigation) are hidden in the depths and not easily discovered, and

therefore the thing itself and the feebleness of human understanding

require that we should not neglect but carefully observe particular forms

which group certain bundles of instances (though by no means all) together

into a common notion. For whatever unites a nature, even imperfectly,

opens a way to the discovery of forms. And therefore instances which are

useful for this purpose have considerable value but no privilege.

However, one must use the greatest caution here lest the human

intellect, after ﬁnding a few of these particular forms and making partitions

or divisions of the nature under investigation, rest in them altogether and

not prepare itself for the true discovery of the great Form, but assume that

the nature is radically multiple and divided, and spurn and reject any

further unity in the nature as a thing of superﬂuous subtlety which verges

on the merely abstract.

For example: suppose the nature under investigation is memory, or that

which provokes and assists memory. The constitutive instances are order or

arrangement, which clearly helps memory; and also in artiﬁcial memory

the constitutive instances are ‘places'.32 ‘Places' may be either places in the

literal sense, such as a door, a corner, a window and so on, or familiar and

well-known persons, or may be anything at all (provided they are put in

a certain order), such as animals or herbs; also words, letters, characters,

historical persons etc., though some of these are more suitable than others.

Such ‘places' give remarkable assistance to the memory, and lift it well

above its natural powers. Likewise poetry stays more easily in the mind

and is more easily learned than prose. And one species of assistance to the

memory is constituted from this bundle of three instances, i.e. order, the

artiﬁcial memory of ‘places' and verses. This species may rightly be called

curtailment of the unlimited. For when one attempts to recall something

or bring it to mind, if he has no prior notion or conception of what he is

looking for, he is surely looking, struggling and running about here and

there in a seemingly unlimited space. But if he has a deﬁnite notion, the

ulimited is immediately curtailed and the range of the memory is kept

within bounds. And there is a clear and deﬁnite notion in the three

instances given above. In the ﬁrst there should be something which agrees

32 Loci = the Greek, topoi, as in the ‘commonplaces' of rhetoric.



Book II

with order; in the second there should be an image which has some

relation or congruence with those speciﬁc ‘places'; in the third, there

should be words which have the rhythm of the verse. Thus the unlimited

is curtailed. Other instances will yield another species: anything that makes

an intellectual notion strike the senses assists the memory (this is the most

prevalent method in artiﬁcial memory). Other instances will yield another

species: the memory is assisted by anything that makes an impression on a

powerful passion, inspiring fear, for example, or wonder shame or joy.

Other instances will yield another species: things which are imprinted on33

a mind which is clear and uncluttered either before or after, for example

what we learn in childhood or what we think of before we go to sleep, or the

ﬁrst experience of a thing, are more likely to remain in the memory. Other

instances yield this next species: a large variety of circumstances or devices

help the memory, e.g. breaking a text up into sections, or reading or

reciting aloud. Other instances, lastly, will yield this ﬁnal species: things

which are expected and attract attention stay better than those which just

slip by. Hence if you read a piece of text through twenty times, you will not

learn it by heart so easily as if you read it ten times while attempting to

recite it from time to time and consulting the text when your memory fails.

Thus there are about six Lesser Forms of things which help the memory:

namely curtailment of the unlimited; reduction of the intellectual to the

sensual; impression on a strong passion; impression on a clear mind; a large

variety of devices; and anticipation.

Another similar example: suppose the nature under investigation is

taste or a tasting. The instances which follow are constitutive: namely,

people who cannot smell and are bereft of that sense by nature fail to notice

or distinguish by taste rancid or rotten food, or on the other hand food

cooked in garlic or rosewater, or suchlike. People whose nostrils are

accidentally blocked by phlegm running down through them fail to notice

or distinguish anything which is oﬀ or rancid or sprinkled with rosewater.

But if they are aﬄicted with such phlegm and give their nose a good blow

at the actual moment when they have the rancid or perfumed thing in their

mouths or on their palate, they have at that moment a clear perception of

the rancidity or perfume. These instances will yield and constitute this

species, or rather this part, of taste; so that the sensation of tasting is in part

simply an interior smelling, which passes down from the higher nasal tubes

33 Reading in for a.



The New Organon

to the mouth and palate. On the other hand, all salty tastes, and sweet,

sharp, acid, sour and bitter tastes, and so on, give the same sensation to

one whose sense of smell is absent or blocked as to anyone else. Hence it is

clear that the sense of taste is a composite of interior smell and a kind of

exquisitely sensitive touch; but this is not the place to discuss that.

Another similar example: suppose the nature under investigation is the

passage of a quality without mixture of substance. The instance of light will

yield or constitute one kind of passage; heat and magnetism another. For

the passage of light is virtually instantaneous, and dies directly the source

light is removed. But heat and magnetic power are transmitted or rather

aroused in another body, and then stay and persists for quite a long time

after the source is removed.

Finally, the privilege of constitutive instances is very great indeed, in that

they contribute most to forming both deﬁnitions (especially particular

deﬁnitions) and divisions or partitions of natures. Plato put it rather well:

the man who knows well how to deﬁne and divide should be regarded as a god.

XXVII

As the sixth of the privileged instances we will put instances of resemblance34

or analogous instances, which we have also chosen to call parallels, or physical

similarities. They are instances which reveal similarities and connections

between things, not in the lesser forms (which is the role of constitutive

instances), but in the actual, concrete object. Thus they are like the ﬁrst and

lowest steps towards the unity of a nature. They do not establish any axiom

directly from the beginning, but only indicate and point to some agreement

between bodies. But though they do not contribute much towards the

discovery of forms, they are extremely useful in uncovering the structure

of parts of a whole, and perform a kind of dissection upon its members;

accordingly they sometimes bring us step by step to sublime and noble

axioms, particularly axioms relating to the structure of the world rather

than to simple forms and natures.

Some examples of instances of resemblance are the eye and a mirror, the

structure of the ear and echoing places. Apart from the actual observation

of the likeness, which has several uses in itself, it is a simple matter to

produce and form the following axiom from this resemblance: that the

34 instantiae conformes



Book II

organs of sense are of a similar nature to bodies which give oﬀ reﬂections

to the senses. Taking its cue from this fact, the understanding in its turn

rises without diﬃculty to a loftier and nobler axiom: namely that agree-

ments or sympathies between bodies endowed with sense and between

inanimate objects without sense diﬀer only in the fact that in the former

case an animal spirit is present in a body equipped to receive it, but is lack-

ing in the latter. Consequently there might be as many senses in animals as

there are agreements in inanimate bodies, if there were perforations in the

animate body for the diﬀusion of animal spirit into a duly prepared limb,

as into a suitable organ. And there undoubtedly are as many motions in an

inanimate body without animal spirit, as there are senses in animals, though

there have to be more motions in inanimate bodies than senses in animate

bodies, because there are so few organs of sense. An obvious and ready

example of this is pain. Though there are many kinds of pain in animals,

with diﬀerent characteristics (the pains of burning, of intense cold, of

pricking, pressing, stretching and so on, are quite diﬀerent from one

another), it is quite certain that, so far as they are motion, they all occur in

inanimate bodies; as in wood or rock when it is burned or contracted by

cold, or bored, cut, bent or crushed; and so for other things; though the

senses do not come into it because of the absence of animal spirits.

Likewise the roots and branches of plants (odd as it may be to say so) are

instances of resemblance. For everything which is vegetable swells and puts

out limbs into its environment both upwards and downwards. The only

diﬀerence between roots and branches is that the root is shut in the earth

and the branches are exposed to air and sun. Take a tender, living shoot of

a tree and bend it over and stick it into a clump of earth, even if it is not

attached to the ground itself, and it will immediately produce a root not a

branch. If on the other hand a plant is covered with earth but so obstructed

by a rock or hard substance that it is prevented from developing foliage on

top, it will put out branches in the air below.

Tree resins and most rock gems are also instances of resemblance. For both

are simply exudations and percolations of juices: in the ﬁrst case of juices

from trees, in the second from rocks; so that both are made clear and lustrous

by close, careful percolation. This is also the reason why the hide of

animals is not so pretty and highly coloured as the plumage of many birds,

because juices do not percolate so delicately through skin as they do

through quills.

Other instances of resemblance are the scrotum in males and the womb in



The New Organon

females. Hence that remarkable structure which diﬀerentiates the sexes (so

far as land animals are concerned) appears to be a matter of outside and

inside; because the greater force of heat in the masculine sex forces the

genitals outside, whereas in females the heat is too weak to do this, with the

result that they remain inside.

Likewise the ﬁns of ﬁsh and the feet of quadrupeds or the feet and wings

of birds, are resembling instances; and Aristotle added the four undulations in

the motion of snakes. And thus in the general structure of things the motion

of living creatures often seems to depend on sets of four joints or bends.

Likewise teeth in land animals and birds' beaks are instances of resemblance;

from which it is clear that in all ﬁnished animals a kind of hard substance

gathers at the mouth.

Likewise it is not absurd that there should be similarity and resemblance

between a man and an inverted plant. For the head is the root of the nerves

and faculties of animals; and the seed parts are at the bottom (ignoring the

extremities of legs and arms), whereas in a plant the root (which is like the

head) is regularly located at the bottom, and the seeds are at the top.

Finally, we much absolutely insist and often recall that men's attention

in the research and compilation of natural history has to be completely

diﬀerent from now on, and transformed to the opposite of the current

practice. Up to now men have put a great deal of hard and careful work into

noting the variety of things and minutely explaining the distinctive features

of animals, herbs and fossils; most of which are more sports of nature than

real diﬀerences of any use to the sciences. Such things certainly give

pleasure and even sometimes have practical use, but contribute little or

nothing to an intimate view of nature. And so we must turn all our attention

to seeking and noting the resemblances and analogies of things, both in

wholes and in parts. For those are the things which unite nature, and begin

to constitute sciences.

But in all this one has to be strict, and very cautious, and accept as

resembling and analogous only those instances which denote physical

similarities (as we have said from the beginning); that is, real and substantial

similarities which are founded in nature, not accidental and apparent

similarities; much less the sort of superstitious or curious resemblances

constantly featured by writers on natural magic (light-minded men and

hardly worth mentioning in such serious matters as we are now discussing)

when with much vanity and foolishness they describe, and even sometimes

invent, empty similarities and sympathies in things.



Book II

These things aside, instances of resemblance should not be ignored in bigger

matters, even in the actual conﬁguration of the earth; such as Africa and

the Peruvian region with the coastline extending to the Strait of Magellan.

For both regions have similar isthmuses and similar promontories, and that

does not happen without a reason.

Likewise the New and the Old World: in the fact that both worlds are

immensely wide towards the North and narrow and pointed towards the

South.

Quite remarkable instances of resemblance are the intense cold in what

they call the middle region of the air, and the very ﬁerce ﬁres which are

often seen to erupt from places under the earth; two things which are

ultimates and extremes: the extremes of the nature of cold towards the

circuit of the sky and of the nature of heat towards the bowels of the earth;

by opposition, or rejection of the contrary nature.

Finally, resemblance of instances in the axioms of science deserves notice.

The rhetorical trope called contrary to expectation resembles the musical

figure known as avoidance of the cadence. Similarly, the mathematical postu-

late that ‘things which are equal to a third thing are also equal to each

other', corresponds with the structure of the syllogism in logic, which joins

things which agree in a middle term. Finally, it is very useful that as many

people as possible should have a keen sense for tracing and tracking

physical similarities and resemblances.

XXVIII

Seventh among the privileged instances we shall put unique instances;35

which we have also chosen to call irregular or heteroclite instances (borrow-

ing a term from the grammarians). These are instances which reveal in

concrete form bodies which seem to be extraordinary and isolated in

nature, having very little in common with other things of the same kind.

For instances of resemblance are like one another, but unique instances are

sui generis. The use of unique instances is like the use of concealed instances,

i.e. to raise and unite nature for the purpose of discovering kinds or com-

mon natures, which are afterwards to be limited by means of genuine

diﬀerentiae. The inquiry should proceed until the properties and qualities

found in things which can be regarded as wonders of nature are reduced

35 instantiae monodicae



The New Organon

and comprehended under some speciﬁc form or law. Thus every irregu-

larity or peculiarity will be found to depend on some common form; and

the wonder at last lies merely in the minute diﬀerentiae, and in the degree

and the unusual combination, not in the species itself; whereas now men's

reasoning gets no further than to call these things secrets of nature or

monstrosities, things without cause and exceptions to the general rules.

Examples of unique instances are the sun and the moon among the stars;

the magnet among stones; quicksilver among metals; the elephant among

quadrupeds; the sensation of sex among kinds of touch; keenness of scent

in dogs among kinds of smell. Also the letter S is taken as unique by

grammarians, because of the easy way in which it combines with conso-

nants, sometimes two, sometimes three; as no other letter does. Such

instances should be prized, because they sharpen and quicken inquiry,

refreshing a mind staled by habit and by the usual course of things.

XXIX

Eighth among privileged instances we shall put deviant instances,36 that is

errors of nature, freaks and monsters, where nature deﬂects and declines

from its usual course. Errors of nature diﬀer from unique instances in the

fact that unique instances are wonders of species, whereas errors of nature

are wonders of individuals. But their use is pretty much the same, because

they fortify the intellect in the face of the commonplace, and reveal common

forms. Here too we must pursue the inquiry until the cause of the deviation

is discovered. However, the cause does not succeed in becoming a form,

merely a latent process on the way to a form. He who knows the ways of

nature will also more easily recognise the deviations. And conversely he

who recognises the deviations will more accurately describe the ways.

They also diﬀer from unique instances in the fact that they much better

prepare the way to practice and application. For it would be very diﬃcult

to create new species; but less diﬃcult to vary known species and thus to

develop many rare and unusual things. It is an easy transition from the

wonders of nature to the wonders of art. For once a nature has been

observed in its variation, and the reason for it made clear, it will be an easy

matter to bring that nature by art to the point it reached by chance. And

not just to that point but to other ends too; for errors in one direction

36 instantiae deviantes



Book II

show and point the way to errors in and deviations in all directions. Here

there is no need of examples, because there are so many. We must make a

collection or particular natural history of all the monsters and prodigious

products of nature, of every novelty, rarity or abnormality in nature. But

this must be done with the greatest discretion, to maintain credibility. We

shall especially suspect things that depend in any way on religion, like the

prodigies in Livy; as well as what we ﬁnd in writers on natural magic or

alchemy or men of that sort who have a passion for fables. Facts should be

taken from serious and credible history and from reliable reports.

XXX

Ninth among privileged instance we shall put borderline instances,37 which we

have also chosen to call instances of sharing.38 They are instances which

exhibit species of body which seem to be compounded of two species, or

elements, that lie between one species and another. These instances may

rightly be regarded as unique or heteroclite instances, since they are rare or

extraordinary in the overall scheme of things. Nevertheless, they should be

classed and discussed separately because of their value: they are excellent

indicators of the composition and structure of things, they point to the

reasons for the number and quality of regular species in the world, and they

lead the intellect from what is to what can be regarded as unique or hetero-

clite instances, since, in the whole of nature, they are rare and extraordinary.

Examples are: moss, which is between putrefaction and plant; some

comets, between stars and blazing meteors; ﬂying ﬁsh, between birds and

ﬁsh; bats, between birds and quadrupeds; also ‘the ape, repulsive creature,

how like us';39 and mongrel animal oﬀspring, as well as mixtures of

diﬀerent species; and the like.

XXXI

As tenth of the privileged instances we shall put instances of power,40 or of the

sceptre (to borrow a word from the emblems of government), which we have

37 instantiniae limitaneae

38 Participia continues the grammatical analogy found in the names for some of the other instances,

e.g. ‘irregular' or ‘heteroclite' for the seventh set of instances. A participium is a participle, so called

because participles ‘share' the nature of both nouns and adjectives.

39 Ennius, quoted by Cicero, On the Nature of the Gods, ..

40 instantiae potestatis



The New Organon

also chosen to call man's contrivances or tools. They are the noblest and most

perfect works, the ﬁnished products of every art. For as the chief thing is

that nature should contribute to human aﬀairs and human advantage, the

ﬁrst step towards this end is to note and enumerate the works that are

already within man's power (the provinces already occupied and subdued);

particularly the most reﬁned and ﬁnished works, because they provide the

easiest and quickest route to new things not yet discovered. If one were to

reﬂect carefully on them and then make a keen and persistent eﬀort to

develop the design, he would surely either improve it in some way, or

modify it to something closely related, or even apply and transfer it to a still

nobler purpose.

This is not the end of it. As rare and unusual works of nature arouse and

stimulate the intellect to seek and discover forms capacious enough to con-

tain them, so too do outstanding and admirable works of art; and more so,

because the way of eﬀecting and achieving such wonders of art is mostly

quite plain, whereas in the wonders of nature it is often quite obscure. But

here too we must be very careful not to hold down the mind and tether it

to the ground.

For there is a danger that such works of art, which seem like the peaks

and high points of human endeavour, may stun the intellect, bind it, and

cast their own particular spell on it so that it becomes incapable of further

knowledge, because it thinks that nothing of that kind can be done except

in the same way as those things were done, with just a little more work and

more careful preparation.

To the contrary, it must be regarded as certain that the ways and means

so far discovered and reported for eﬀecting things and developing

products are mostly rather petty aﬀairs; all major power is dependent on

the forms, and derived in order from them; they are the sources, and none

of them has yet been discovered.

And therefore (we have said elsewhere) no one reﬂecting on the

machines and battering rams of the ancients would come up with the

invention of the cannon operating by means of gunpowder, however

persistently he worked at it, even if he spent his life on it. Nor again would

anyone who ﬁxed his thoughts and observations on wool-working and

plant-derived threads41 ever have discovered by this means the nature of

the silkworm or of the silk derived from it.

41 Presumably linen or cotton



Book II

And so (when you think about it) all that can be regarded as the more

remarkable inventions have come to light quite by chance, and not through

little reﬁnements and extensions of arts. Nothing exhibits them more

quickly,42 moves faster, than chance (whose way of achievement takes

centuries), except the discovery of forms.

There is no need to give particular examples of such instances, because

there are so many of them. What is absolutely needed is to do a thorough

survey and examination of all the mechanical arts, and of the liberal arts too

(so far as they may result in works), and then to make a compilation or

particular history of the great accomplishments, the magisterial achieve-

ments and ﬁnished works, in each art, together with their modes of work-

ing or operation.

We do not however limit the hard work which needs to be done in making

a compilation of this kind to rehearsing the acknowledged masterpieces

and secrets of an art which arouse our wonder. For wonder is the child of

rarity; since rare things cause wonder even though they are in their kind of

common natures.

On the other hand, things which are truly wonderful because of

their diﬀerence in kind compared with other species are barely noticed

if they are in common use around us. We should take note of unique

instances of art, as well as unique phenomena of nature, as we have said

before. Just as we included the sun, the moon, the magnet and so on

among the unique instances of nature, though they are very ordinary albeit

of almost unique nature, so we should do the same for the unique instances

of art.

For example: paper is a unique instance of art; a common enough thing.

But look at the matter carefully. Artiﬁcial materials are either simply woven

from upright and horizontal threads, like cloth made of silk, wool, linen

etc.; or made of dried liquids, such as brick, or earthenware, or glass, or

enamel, or porcelain, and so on; they shine if closely compacted; if not, they

harden but do not shine. Now everything made of dried liquids is fragile,

and not in the least tacky or tenacious. Paper however is a tenacious

substance which can be cut and torn; so that it imitates and almost rivals

the skin or membrane of an animal, or the foliage of a vegetable, and such

natural products. It is not fragile like glass nor woven like cloth; it certainly

has ﬁbres, but not distinct threads, altogether like natural materials. And

42 repraesentat: ef. . ad ﬁn.



The New Organon

so it is found to have hardly any similarity with other artiﬁcial materials

but to be absolutely unique. The better kinds of artiﬁcial materials are

surely those which either most closely imitate nature, or on the other hand

masterfully rule her and change her completely.

Again, among the contrivances and tools of man, we should not condemn

tricks and toys out of hand. Their applications are trivial and frivolous, but

some of them may be useful for information.

Finally, we must not altogether ignore superstition and (as long as the

word is taken in its common sense) magic. Such things are deeply buried

under great heaps of fables and lies, but one should still look into them a

little to see whether perhaps some natural operation lives a latent life in any

of them; as in spells, the fortiﬁcation of the imagination, agreement

between distant objects, the transmission of impressions from spirit to

spirit no less than from body to body, and so on.

XXXII

It is obvious from what has been said that instances of the last ﬁve kinds

discussed (that is, instances of resemblance, unique instances, deviant instances,

borderline instances and instances of power) should not be kept back until we

are investigating a particular nature, in the way in which we should keep

back the instances we listed ﬁrst and some of the following ones. Rather we

should make a collection of them, a kind of particular history, right at the

start; so that they may organise what enters the intellect, and improve the

intellect's own feeble condition, which simply cannot avoid being

impressed and coloured, and in the end twisted and distorted, by the

constant assault of everyday impressions.

We should employ these instances as a preliminary training, to correct

and cleanse the intellect. Anything that draws the intellect away from

common things smooths and polishes its surface for the reception of the

clear, dry light of true ideas.

Such instances also lay and pave the road that leads to practical applica-

tion, as we shall argue at the appropriate point when we discuss deduction

to practice.43

43 Bacon never wrote this proposed section of The New Organon.



Book II

XXXIII

As the eleventh of the privileged instances we shall put instances of association

and of aversion,44 which we have also chosen to call instances of unchanging

propositions. These are the instances which exhibit a substance or concrete

thing, in which the nature under investigation either inevitably follows, like

an indivisible companion, or on the other hand always turns and ﬂees and

is excluded from association, like an enemy and an alien. On the basis of

such instances we form sure, universal propositions, either aﬃrmative or

negative, in which the subject will be a particular body in concrete form,

and the predicate the sought nature. For particular propositions are not

unchanging at all; they are propositions where the sought nature is found to

be ﬂuid and unstable in a concrete object; i.e. it is a nature which is

approaching or acquired, or on the other hand departing or shed. Thus

particular propositions have no great privilege, except only in the case

of transition which we discussed above.45 Nevertheless, even particular

propositions are valuable when collated and compared with universal

propositions, as we shall argue at the appropriate point. But even in

universal propositions we do not require total or absolute aﬃrmation or

negation. It is adequate for the purpose if they admit some unique or rare

exception.

Thus the function of instances of association is to narrow the scope of the

aﬃrmative of a form. In instances of transition the aﬃrmative of a form is

narrowed down, so that we have to understand the form of the thing as

something which is accepted or rejected by the act of transition. Similarly

in instances of association the aﬃrmative of a form is narrowed down, so that

we are compelled to recognise the form of the thing as something which

enters into the composition of such a body, or on the other hand refuses

to do so; so that anyone who becomes familiar with the structure or ﬁgure

of such a body is close to bringing the form of the sought nature into the

light.

For example: suppose the sought nature is heat. The associated instance

is ﬂame. For in water, air, stone, metal and most other things heat is mobile,

and can come and go; but all ﬂame is hot, so that heat is always associated

with the formation of ﬂame. No instance of aversion to heat occurs in our

experience. We have no sense experience of the bowels of the earth; but

44 instantiae comitatus, atque hostiles

45 ..



The New Organon

there is no concretion of bodies known to us which is not susceptible of

heat.

Or suppose that the sought nature is Solidity. An averse instance is air.

Metal may be molten or solid; so may glass; even water can be solid, when

it freezes: but it is impossible for air ever to solidify, or lose its ﬂuidity.

There remain two cautions about instances of unchanging propositions rel-

evant to our discussion. First if there is no absolute universal, aﬃrmative

or negative, we should carefully note that fact itself as non-existent, just as

we did in the case of heat, where the universal negative (so far as entities

within our experience are concerned) is lacking in nature. Similarly, if

the nature under investigation is eternal or incorruptible, the aﬃrmative

universal is not available in our experience. For eternal or incorruptible

cannot be predicated of any substance beneath the heavens, or above the

interior of the earth. The second caution is that universal propositions,

both negative and positive, about a concrete thing have concrete things

attached to them which seem to approach the non-existent. In the case of

heat, very gentle, barely burning ﬂames; in the case of incorruptibility,

gold, which is the nearest thing to it. All these things point to the natural

boundaries between being and non-being; and help to deﬁne the limits

of forms, so that they do not swell and stray beyond the conditions of

matter.

XXXIV

Twelfth among privileged instances we shall put those accessory46

instances47 of which we spoke in the previous aphorism; which we have also

chosen to call instances of the end or terminal instances. Such instances

are not only useful when attached to unchanging propositions, but also

in themselves and of their own nature. For they clearly mark the true

divisions of nature, the measures of things, the vital how far a nature can

do or suﬀer anything, and the transition from one nature to another. Such

are, in weight, gold; in hardness, iron; the whale in animal size; the dog in

smell; the lighting of gunpowder in swiftness of expansion; and so on. They

show the ﬁnal degrees at the bottom of the scale no less than at the top;

as spirit of wine in weight; silk in softness; skin grubs in animal size; and

so on.

46 Subjunctiva resumes the grammatical analogy: ‘subjunctive' mood.

47 instantiae subjunctivae

XXXV

Thirteenth among privileged instances we shall put instances of alliance or of

union.48 They are instances which fuse and unite natures thought to be

heterogeneous, and are noted and marked as such in the accepted distinc-

tions.

Instances of alliance reveal that the operations and eﬀects which are

classed as belonging to one heterogeneous nature also belong to other

heterogeneous natures; and this proves that the supposed heterogeneity is

not genuine or essential, but simply a modiﬁcation of a common nature.

They are therefore of the highest value in lifting and raising the mind

from diﬀerences to genera, and for getting rid of the phantoms and false

images49 of things as they come forward to meet us in disguise in concrete

substances.

For example: suppose the nature under investigation is Heat. There

seems to be a quite usual and authentic distinction between three kinds of

heat, viz. the heat of the heavenly bodies, the heat of animals and the heat of

ﬁre; and these heats (especially one of them compared to the other two) are

diﬀerent and quite heterogeneous in their actual essence and species, or in

their speciﬁc nature; for the heat of heavenly bodies and of animals creates

and nourishes, whereas the heat of ﬁre corrupts and destroys. An instance of

alliance therefore is the quite common experience of bringing a vine branch

into a house where a ﬁre is kept burning on the hearth, so that the grapes

ripen as much as a month earlier than outside; so that one can speed the

ripening of the fruit, even when it is hanging on the tree, by using a ﬁre,

though this seems to be the proper function of the sun. From this beginning

the mind rejects essential heterogeneity, and readily rises to inquire what

real diﬀerences are found between the heat of the sun and ﬁre which make

their operations so dissimilar, despite their sharing a common nature.

The diﬀerences will be found to be four: ﬁrst, the heat of the sun by com-

parison with the heat of ﬁre is much gentler and softer in degree. Secondly

(particularly as it reaches us through the air), it is much more humid in

quality. Thirdly (and this is the main diﬀerence), it is supremely incon-

stant, now approaching and increasing and then receding and diminishing,

which is what most contributes to the generation of bodies. For Aristotle

rightly asserted that the principal cause why things come to be and pass

48 instantiae foederis sive unionis

49 ‘phantoms and false images' (Ellis)



The New Organon

away, here on the surface of the earth, is the oblique path of the sun through

the zodiac; as a result of which the sun's heat is actually amazingly incon-

stant, partly by the alternation of day and night and partly by the succes-

sion of summers and winters. Yet Aristotle never fails immediately to twist

and distort what he had truly discovered. For in his habitual role as arbiter

of nature he magisterially determines that the approach of the sun is the

cause of coming-to-be and its recession the cause of passing away; whereas

both things (i.e. the sun's approach and the sun's recession) are a reason for

both coming-to-be and passing away indiﬀerently, not respectively, since

inequality of heat causes things to be born and to pass away, while equality

of heat favours only preservation. There is also a fourth diﬀerence between

the heat of the sun and the heat of ﬁre, a diﬀerence of immense signiﬁcance:

viz. that the sun deploys its operations through long spaces of time,

whereas the operations of ﬁre (under pressure from man's impatience) are

brought to a result in a relatively brief period. However, one might take

constant care to control the heat of a ﬁre and reduce it to a mild and

moderate temperature (there are many ways to do this), and one might also

sprinkle and mingle moisture with it, and in particular one might imitate

the inconstancy of the sun, and ﬁnally be patient and accept the time it

takes (this would certainly not be a period like that of the works of the sun,

but still a longer time than men normally take in operations with ﬁre). If

one does all this, he will easily dismiss the [notion of] the heterogeneity of

heat, and will with the heat of a ﬁre either approach or equal or in some

cases surpass the operations of the sun. A similar instance of alliance is the

resuscitation, with a little warmth from a ﬁre, of butterﬂies stunned and

half-killed by cold; by which you may easily see that ﬁre is no more barred

from reviving animals than from ripening vegetables. Also Fracastoro's50

famous invention of the highly heated pan with which doctors cup the

heads of stroke victims whose lives are despaired of, obviously expands the

animal spirits which are suppressed and almost extinguished by humours

and obstructions of the brain; and stirs them into activity; it works as ﬁre

works on water or air, and yet it has the eﬀect of restoring life. Eggs too are

sometimes hatched by the heat of a ﬁre, in direct imitation of animal heat;

there are several other such instances; so that no one can doubt that the

heat of ﬁre can, in many subjects, be tempered to be an image of the heat

of heavenly bodies and animals.

Similarly, suppose the sought natures are motion and rest. There seems

to be a common division, which is also drawn from the heart of philosophy,

that natural bodies either rotate, or move in a straight line, or stand and stay

at rest. For there is either motion without end, or rest at an end, or move-

ment towards an end. Perpetual motion of rotation seems to be peculiar to

heavenly bodies; staying or rest seems to belong to the globe of the earth

itself; but other bodies, which they call heavy and light, that is bodies which

are outside their natural places, move in a straight line towards masses or

accumulations of things like themselves: light things upwards towards the

circuit of heaven, heavy things downwards towards the earth. These are

ﬁne things to say.

A low comet is an instance of alliance; though it is far below the heaven,

it rotates. And the ﬁction of Aristotle about a comet's attachment to or

pursuit of a particular star has long been discredited; not only because the

explanation of it is not probable, but because of the observed fact of the

wandering and irregular movement of comets through the diﬀerent areas

of the sky.

Again another instance of alliance in this subject is the motion of air;

which seems itself to revolve from east to west between the tropics (where

the circles of rotation are greater).

Yet another instance would be the ebb and ﬂow of the sea, provided that

the waters themselves were seen to move with a motion of rotation (albeit

slow and diﬃcult to observe) from east to west; but in such a way that

they are driven back twice a day. If that is the case, it is obvious that the

motion of rotation is not conﬁned to the heavens but is shared with air and

water.

The ability of light objects to move upwards varies somewhat. Take a

bubble of water as an instance of alliance in this case. Air under water

ascends rapidly towards the surface because of the motion of a ‘blow' (as

Democritus51 calls it) by which descending water strikes and raises the air

up, and not by struggle or striving on the part of the air itself. On reaching

the water's surface, the air is prevented from rising further by the light

resistance which it ﬁnds in the water not immediately allowing itself to be

parted; and thus the air's own tendency upwards is very slight.

Likewise suppose the sought nature is weight. It is a very well-accepted

distinction that dense and solid objects tend towards the centre of the earth,

51 For Democritus see note on ..



The New Organon

while light and rare objects tend towards the circuit of the sky, as towards

their own places. And as regards places, it is quite silly and childish to think

(though thoughts of this kind are prevalent in the schools) that place has

any inﬂuence at all. Hence philosophers talk nonsense when they say that

if a hole were made through the earth, heavy bodies would stop when they

came to the earth's centre. For it would surely be a wonderfully powerful

and eﬀective kind of nothing or mathematical point which had an eﬀect on

other things and which other things would seek; for body is acted on only

by body. But the tendency to move up and down is either in the structure

of the moving body or in a sympathy or agreement with another body. If

any body is found which is dense and solid but which nevertheless does

not tend towards the ground, such a distinction is shattered. If Gilbert's

opinion52 is accepted that the magnetic force of the earth to attract heavy

objects does not extend beyond the circle of its own power (which operates

always up to a certain distance and not beyond it), and this is veriﬁed by

some instance, it will in fact be an instance of alliance in this subject.

However, no certain and obvious instance on this point has come to notice

up to now. The nearest thing to it seems to be the waterspouts which are

often seen on voyages through the Atlantic Ocean to either Indies. So great

apparently is the mass and force of water suddenly released by such water-

spouts that there seems to have been a prior accumulation of water which

has stalled and stayed in these places, and then been thrown and forced

down by some violent cause, rather than to have fallen by the natural

motion of its weight. Hence it may be conjectured that a dense and com-

pact physical mass at a great distance from the earth will hang in suspense

like the earth itself; and will not fall unless thrown down. But we claim no

certainty here. And in this and many other cases, it will easily be seen how

poor we are in natural history, since we are sometimes compelled to adduce

suppositions instead of certain instances.

Likewise suppose the sought nature is the discursive movement of the

mind. It seems to be quite correct to make a distinction between human

reason and the cleverness of animals. And yet there are some instances of

actions done by animals which suggest that animals do seem to go through

a chain of reasoning: the story is told of a crow almost dead of thirst in a

great drought, who caught a glimpse of some water in the hollow trunk of

a tree, and since the trunk was too narrow to get into, it dropped in pebbles

52 For GiIbert see note on ..



Book II

one after the other so that the water level would rise for it to drink: this

became proverbial.53

Likewise suppose the sought nature is the visible. There seems to be a

perfectly true and certain distinction between light, which is the original

visible and the primary source of sight, and colour, which is a secondary

visible and is not seen without light, so that it seems to be nothing other

than an image or modiﬁcation of light. And yet there appear to be instances

of alliance on this on both sides: i.e. snow in large quantities and a sulphur

ﬂame; in one of which there appears to be a colour just becoming light, and

in the other light verging on colour.

XXXVI

In the fourteenth place among privileged instances we place crucial

instances;54 we take the term from the signposts which are erected at forks in

the road to indicate and mark where the diﬀerent roads go.55 We have also

chosen to call them decisive instances and instances of verdicts, and in some

cases oracular and commanding instances. This is how they work. Sometimes

in the search for a nature the intellect is poised in equilibrium and cannot

decide to which of two or (occasionally) more natures it should attribute or

assign the cause of the nature under investigation, because many natures

habitually occur close together; in these circumstances crucial instances

reveal that the fellowship of one of the natures with the nature under

investigation is constant and indissoluble, while that of the other is ﬁtful

and occasional. This ends the search as the former nature is taken as the

cause and the other dismissed and rejected. Thus instances of this kind give

the greatest light and the greatest authority; so that a course of interpreta-

tion sometimes ends in them and is completed through them. Sometimes

crucial instances simply occur, being found among instances long familiar,

but for the most part they are new and deliberately and speciﬁcally devised

and applied; it takes keen and constant diligence to unearth them.

For example, suppose the nature under investigation is the ebb and ﬂow

of the sea, repeated twice a day, six hours for each incoming and outgoing

tide, with some diﬀerence which corresponds to the motions of the moon.

The fork of the road in this nature is as follows.

The New Organon

This motion has to be caused either by a forward-and-backward move-

ment of the waters, like water sloshing back and forth in a basin, which

leaves one side of the basin when it covers the other, or by the waters

rising and subsiding from the depths, like water boiling up and then sub-

siding. But one is in doubt to which of the two causes to attribute the ebb

and ﬂow. If the ﬁrst account is accepted, then when there is a high tide in

the sea on one side, there has to be a low tide in the sea at the same time

elsewhere. And so this is the form the investigation will take. And yet

Acosta56 and many others have observed (after careful investigation) that

there are high tides at the same time on the shores of Florida and on the

opposite shores of Spain and Africa, and likewise low tides at the same

times, and not the contrary, that when it is high tide on the shores of

Florida, it is low tide on the shores of Spain and Africa. However, if one

looks at it still more carefully, this does not prove a rising motion and refute

a forward motion. For it can happen that waters move forward, while ﬂood-

ing both shores of a stretch of water at the same time, i.e. if those waters are

subjected to force and pressure from another direction, as happens in

rivers, where the ebb and ﬂow on both shores occurs at the same time, even

though the motion is clearly motion forward, the motion of waters enter-

ing the river mouth from the sea. And so it may be similarly that waters

coming in a great mass from the East Indian Ocean are driven and thrust

into the basin of the Atlantic Sea, and thus ﬂood both sides at the same

time. We must therefore ask whether there is another basin through which

the waters can at the same time ebb and ﬂow back. And there is, the

Southern Sea, which is not smaller than the Atlantic, but rather wider and

vaster, and would be adequate for this purpose.

And so we have reached the crucial instance on this subject. Here it is: if

it is found for certain that when it is high tide on the opposing shores of

both Florida and Spain in the Atlantic Sea, there is at the same time high

tide on the shores of Peru and near the mainland of China in the Southern

Sea; then by this decisive instance we must certainly reject the assertion that

the ebb and ﬂow of the sea (the subject of the inquiry) occurs by a forward

motion; there is no other sea or place remaining where there could be a

retreat or ebb at the same time. This could most conveniently be known if

inquiry were made of the inhabitants of Panama and Lima (where the two

Oceans, the Atlantic and the Southern, are separated by a small Isthmus)

56 Jose de Acosta (c. –), Spanish Jesuit missionary to Peru. Published The Natural and Moral

History of the Indies (; translated into English ).



Book II

whether the ebb and ﬂow of the sea on the two sides of the Isthmus occur

at the same time or not. Now this verdict or deﬁnitive rejection seems

certain if we posit that the earth is unmoving. However, if the earth rotates,

it may perhaps be that the earth and the waters of the sea rotate unequally

(unequal in speed or force), the consequence of which would be violent

pressure forcing the waters up into a heap, which is the high tide, and a sub-

sequent dropping of the waters (when they can no longer stay heaped up),

which is the ebb. This needs a separate inquiry. But on this supposition also

it remains equally true that there has to be an ebb of the sea somewhere at

the same time as there are high tides elsewhere.

Likewise suppose the nature under investigation is the latter of the two

motions which we ﬁrst assumed, viz. arising and subsiding motion of the

sea if, after careful examination, we do in fact reject the other motion we

mentioned, the forward motion. There will then be a three-way fork in the

road: the motion by which waters rise and fall in their ebbs and ﬂows, with-

out the addition of other waters ﬂowing into them, has to occur in one of

three ways. It may be because a great mass of water wells up from the

interior of the earth and then sinks back into it; or because there is not a

larger amount of water, but the same waters (with no increase of quantity)

are stretched or thinned out so that they occupy a greater space and dimen-

sion, and then contract; or because the quantity and extension are no

greater, but the same waters (same both in quantity and in density and rarity)

rise and fall through some magnetic force above which attracts and draws

them up, through agreement.57 Let us leave aside the ﬁrst two motions and

narrow the inquiry (if you please) to this last [possibility]; and let inquiry be

made whether there is any such raising by agreement or magnetic force.

And ﬁrst it is evident that all the waters, as they lie in the trench or bed of

the sea, cannot be raised together at the same time, because there would be

nothing to take their place at the bottom; hence if the waters had any such

tendency to rise, it would be broken and restrained by the bonds of nature,

or (as they commonly say) to prevent the occurrence of a vacuum. The only

explanation left is that the waters rise in one place and, for that reason, fall

and recede in another place. In fact, it will necessarily follow that since the

magnetic force cannot operate over the whole, it operates most intensely

over the centre, so that it lifts the waters in the middle, and when they are

raised, they move away for the sides and leave them bare and uncovered.

57 ‘Agreement' = consensus. Bacon contrasts consensus with sympathia (a term he rejects) at .().



The New Organon

And thus at last we have reached the crucial instance on this subject. It is

this: if it is found that in the ebbs of the sea the surface of the waters in the

sea is more arched and rounded as the waters rise in the middle of the sea

and fall away at the edges, which are the shores; and in the ﬂows the same

surface is planer and ﬂatter when the waters return to their former position;

then by this decisive instance we can certainly accept raising by magnetic

force; otherwise it has to be totally rejected. And this is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd

out by making use of sounding lines in straits; i.e. to ﬁnd out whether

towards the centre of the sea the water is higher or deeper in ebbs than in

ﬂows. And we must note that if this is so, the fact (contrary to belief) is that

the waters rise in ebbs, and fall only in ﬂows, so as to cover and ﬂood the

beaches.

Similarly, suppose the nature under investigation is the spontaneous

motion of rotation, and particularly whether the diurnal motion by which

the sun and the stars rise and fall to our view is a true motion of rotation in

the heavens, or an apparent motion in the heavens but a true one in the

earth. A crucial instance on this subject would be as follows. If we ﬁnd in the

ocean a motion from east to west, however feeble and sluggish; if we ﬁnd

the same motion a little more rapid in the air, especially within the tropics,

where it is easier to detect because of the larger circumference; if we ﬁnd

the same motion in the lower comets, now in a strong and lively form; if we

ﬁnd the same motion in the planets, yet so apportioned and graduated that

the shorter the distance from the earth, the slower it is, the further the

faster, and at its swiftest in the heaven of the stars: then we should certainly

acknowledge the truth of diurnal motion in the heavens, and must deny the

motion of the earth; because it will be clear that the motion from east to

west goes throughout the cosmos, and is based on the agreement of the

whole universe, and is at its most rapid in the heights of heaven, and grows

faint by degrees, and ﬁnally languishes and fails at the unmoving point,

namely the earth.

Similarly, let the nature under investigation be the other motion of rota-

tion which the astronomers often cite, which resists and runs contrary to

the diurnal motion, namely motion from west to east; which the old

astronomers attribute to the planets and to the heaven of the stars as well,

but Copernicus58 and his disciples attribute also to the earth; and let it be

asked whether any such motion is found in nature, or whether it is rather

58 Nicolaus Copernicus (–) published De Revolutionibus orbium coelestium in . It includes

a heliocentric account of the solar system.



Book II

a ﬁction and a supposition to speed and shorten calculations, and to

support that pretty theory which explains the heavenly motions by perfect

circles. For this motion is certainly not shown to be a true and real motion

in the heavens either by the fact that a planet fails to return to the same

point of the starry heaven in its daily motion, or by the diﬀerence between

the poles of the zodiac and the poles of the earth; which are the two things

that have encouraged the idea of this motion. For the ﬁrst phenomenon is

best saved by precedence and dereliction;59 and the second by spiral lines;

so that the inequality of return and the decline towards the tropics may be

rather modiﬁcations of the one true diurnal motion than resistant motions

or motions around diﬀerent poles. And it is quite certain, if we take the

view for the moment of the common man (dismissing the ﬁctions of

astronomers and schoolmen, who have the habit of making unwarranted

assaults on common sense, and preferring obscurities), that to the senses

the motion is such as we have described it; whose image we once repre-

sented (as in a machine) by iron wires.

But a crucial instance in this subject could be as follows. If we found in

an account worthy of belief; that there had been a comet, either higher or

lower, which did not rotate in evident agreement (even if rather irregular)

with the diurnal motion, but rather rotated against the direction of the

heavens; then certainly this much has to be allowed, that there may be some

such motion in nature. But if we ﬁnd nothing of the kind, we must regard

it as suspect, and have recourse to other crucial instances on the point.

Similarly, suppose the nature under investigation is weight or heaviness.

The fork in the road on this nature is as follows. Heavy and weighty things

must necessarily either tend of their own nature towards the centre of the

earth because of their own structure; or be attracted and drawn by the

physical mass of the earth itself as by an agglomeration of connatural bodies,

borne towards it by agreement. But if the latter is the reason, it follows that

the closer heavy things get to the earth, the more powerfully they are borne

towards it, and the greater their impetus; the further they are from it, the

more feebly and slowly (as is the case with magnetic attraction); and that

this occurs within a certain space; so that if they are so distant from the

earth that its power cannot act on them, they will remain in suspense, like

the earth itself; and will never fall.

And therefore a crucial instance on this matter could be as follows. Take

59 ‘by supposing that the ﬁxed stars outrun the planets, and leave them behind' (Ellis)



The New Organon

one of those clocks which move by lead weights, and one of those which

move by a compressed iron spring; and let them be accurately tested, so

that neither of them is faster or slower than the other; then let the clock that

moves by weights be placed on the top of a very high church, the other kept

below; and let it be noted whether the higher clock moves more slowly than

it did because the weights have less power. Let the same experiment be

done at the bottom of mines deep below the earth, to see whether a clock

of this kind does not move faster than it did, because the weights have

increased power. If it is found that the power of the weights decreases at a

height and increases under the earth, attraction from the physical mass of

the earth may be taken as the cause of weight.

Similarly, let the nature under investigation be the polarity of an iron

needle touched by a magnet. The fork in the road for such a nature will be

as follows. The touch of a magnet must necessarily either confer polarity

towards north and south on the needle of itself; or merely excite the iron

and make it ready, the motion being conferred by the presence of the earth,

as Gilbert thinks and tries so hard to prove. And thus all the cases which

he has collected with perceptive diligence come down to this: namely that

an iron nail, which has long lain in a north–south position, gathers polarity

by the long lapse of time, without being touched by a magnet; as if the earth

itself; which works weakly because of the distance (for the surface or outer

crust of the earth is without magnetic virtue, according to him), does

nevertheless, given enough time, act like the touch of a magnet, and excite

the iron and conform it to itself in its excited state and turn it. Again, his

work shows that if a piece of iron, heated red-hot,60 lay, as it went cold, in

a north–south position, it too would gather polarity without the touch of a

magnet: as if 61 the parts of the iron which were set in motion by being

heated and afterwards contracted in the very moment of their getting cold,

were more susceptible and sensitive to the force emanating from the earth

than at other times, and hence were as it were excited. But though these

things are well observed, they do not prove quite what he claims.

A crucial instance on this subject would be as follows: take a magnetic

compass and mark its poles; and let the poles of the compass be placed

east–west, not north–south; and let them so lie; then place an untouched

iron needle on it and allow it to remain for six or seven days. While the

needle remains over the magnet (of this there is no doubt) it will ignore

60 Reading candens for cadens. Kitchin clearly did the same, translating ‘ignited and red-hot'.

61 Reading ac for sc.



Book II

the poles of the earth and align itself with the poles of the magnet; and thus

as long as it remains like this, it is turned towards the east and west of the

world. But when we remove the needle from the magnet and set it on a

pivot, if we ﬁnd it immediately turning north–south, or even moving

gradually in that direction, then we must accept the presence of the earth

as the cause. But if it either turns (as it did before) to the east and west or

loses its polarity, we must treat that reason as suspect, and make further

inquiry.

Similarly, let the nature sought be the physical substance of the moon:

whether it is light, ﬁery or airy, as most of the old philosophers believed, or

solid and dense, as Gilbert and many of the moderns hold, together with

some of the ancients. The reasons for the latter view are based especially

on the fact that the moon reﬂects the rays of the sun; and it seems that

reﬂection of light occurs only from solids.

And thus the crucial instances on this subject will be those (if there are

any) which show reﬂection from a light body, such as ﬂame so long as it is

suﬃciently dense. Certainly one cause of twilight, among others, is the

reﬂection of the rays of the sun from the upper part of the air. We also

sometimes see the rays of the sun reﬂected, on ﬁne evenings, from wisps of

rosy cloud, with no less brightness, in fact with a clearer and more glorious

brightness than that given oﬀ by the body of the moon; but it is not estab-

lished that those clouds have formed into a dense body of water. We also

see at night that dark air reﬂects the light of a candle in a window as well as

a dense body would. The experiment should be tried of letting the rays of

the sun pierce through a hole on to a dusky blue ﬂame. Certainly when the

rays of the full sun fall on not very bright ﬂames, they seem to kill them, so

that they look more like white smoke than ﬂames. These are the things that

occur to me as examples of crucial instances in this matter; and probably

better ones can be found. But one must always bear in mind that no reﬂec-

tion is to be expected from a ﬂame unless the ﬂame has a certain depth;

otherwise it verges on the transparent. But what should be regarded as

certain is that light on an even body is always either taken and passed

through, or reﬂected.

Similarly, let the nature under investigation be the motion through the

air of missiles, e.g. javelins, arrows, balls. The School (in its usual manner)

deals with this very carelessly, being satisﬁed to distinguish it under the

name of violent motion from what they call natural motion; and as for the

ﬁrst blow or thrust, is content with saying ‘that two bodies cannot be in one



The New Organon

place, lest there be a penetration of dimensions', and takes no account of

the further progress of this motion. But the fork of the road in this matter

is as follows: the motion is caused either because the air carries the body

which is being propelled, and gathers behind it, as a river does to a boat or

a wind to straws; or because the parts of the body itself do not resist the

blow, but run forward one after the other to get away from it. Fracastoro62

accepts the ﬁrst view, and so do nearly all those who have made more than

a cursory investigation of this motion; and there is no doubt that the air

plays some role in this; but the other motion is undoubtedly the true one,

as an inﬁnite number of experiments prove. One crucial instance among

others on this subject is as follows: ﬂex a sheet of iron or a strong piece of

iron wire, or a reed or quill pen sliced down the middle, and bend it

between ﬁnger and thumb, and it will spring away. It is obvious that this

cannot be attributed to the air gathering behind the body, because the

source of motion is in the middle of the sheet or reed, not at the ends.

Similarly, let the nature under investigation be the rapid, powerful

expansive motion of gunpowder into ﬂame, which destroys such massive

objects and shoots such immense weights as we see in mines and cannon.

The fork in this nature is as follows. Either the motion is initiated by the

simple tendency of the expanding body when it is set on ﬁre, or in addition

by the tendency of the crude spirit, which rapidly ﬂees the ﬁre, and as it

pours around it, breaks violently away, like a horse from the starting gate.

But the School and common opinion deal only with the ﬁrst tendency. For

men think that it is a ﬁne piece of reasoning to assert that, because of the

form of its element, a ﬂame is endowed with a kind of necessity to occupy

a larger space than the same body had ﬁlled when in the form of powder,

and that is why the motion follows. However, they fail to notice that though

this is true (since the ﬂame is actually generated), still its generation may

be prevented by a mass of stuﬀ stiﬂing and suﬀocating it, so that the process

does not reach the necessity they speak of. For they are right in thinking

that if ﬂame is generated, expansion must occur and emission or ejection

of the body obstructing it must follow. But that necessity is obviously

averted if the solid mass suppressed the ﬂame before it was generated. And

we see that a ﬂame, especially at its ﬁrst generation, is soft and gentle, and

requires a space in which it can try itself out and play. And therefore we

cannot ascribe so much force to the thing in itself. But this is true: the

62 For Fracastoro see n.  above.



Book II

generation of these blasting ﬂames and ﬁery winds happens as the result of

a struggle between two substances whose natures are totally contradictory

to each other. One is highly inﬂammable, the nature which ﬂourishes in

sulphur; the other abhorring ﬁre, as does the crude spirit in nitre. The

result is a marvellous conﬂict as the sulphur ﬁres itself so much as it can

(for the third substance, namely willow charcoal, does little more than join

the other two substances and properly unite them), and the spirit of nitre

breaks out, so far as it can, and at the same time expands (for air too and all

crude substances, as well as water, react to heat by expanding), and as it

ﬂees and bursts out, it blows the ﬂame of sulphur in all directions, like a

hidden bellows.

There could be two kinds of crucial instances in this subject. The one

consists of substances which are most inﬂammable, such as sulphur,

camphor, naphtha and so on, with their mixtures; which take ﬁre more

swiftly and easily than gunpowder if they are not obstructed; and this

makes it clear that it is not the simple tendency to catch ﬁre in itself which

has that stupendous eﬀect. The other consists of substances which avoid

ﬁre and shrink from it, such as all the salts. For we see that if they are

thrown into a ﬁre, a watery spirit breaks out, with a crackling noise, before

ﬁre starts; and this also happens in a gentler way even with leaves if they

are a little bit resistant, as the watery part breaks out before the oily part

catches ﬁre. But it is seen best in quicksilver, which is well called mineral

water. For apart from catching ﬁre, it almost equals the power of gunpowder

in sheer eruption and expansion; and when it is mixed with gunpowder it

is said to compound its strength.

Similarly, let the nature under investigation be the transitory nature of

ﬂame and its instant extinction. For the nature of ﬂame does not appear to

be ﬁxed and stable here on earth, but to be generated at every moment and

directly extinguished. For it is evident that in the case of ﬂames, in our

experience, which last and endure, their duration is not that of the same

ﬂame as an individual, but is maintained by a succession of new ﬂames

constantly generated, and the numerically identical ﬂame lasts only a

very short while; and this is easily seen from the fact that the ﬂame dies as

soon as you take away its fuel or nourishment. The fork in this matter is as

follows. The momentary nature occurs either because the cause which ﬁrst

generated it lets up, as in the case of light, sounds and the so-called violent

motions; or because the ﬂame could in its nature endure here on earth, but

suﬀers violence from contrary natures around it, and is destroyed.



The New Organon

Therefore a crucial instance on this matter may be as follows. In great

ﬁres we see how high ﬂames leap. For the wider the base of the ﬂame, the

higher the top. And so it seems that extinction begins to occur at the edges,

where the ﬂame is oppressed by air and is feeble. But the central parts of

the ﬂame, which the air does not touch and which is surrounded by other

ﬂame on all sides, remain numerically the same and are not extinguished

until they are squeezed in bit by bit by the air around the edges. And that

is why all ﬂame is pyramidal, wider at the base near the fuel and more

pointed at the top (where the air threatens it and the fuel cannot keep it

supplied). Smoke, the other hand, which is narrower at the base, gets wider

as it rises, and becomes like an inverted pyramid; that is because air accepts

smoke, and compresses ﬂame (nor should anyone imagine that air is burn-

ing ﬂame, since they are completely heterogeneous substances).

There could be a more precisely appropriate crucial instance on this

matter if the thing could by chance be exhibited through two-coloured

ﬂames. So let a small metal candle-holder be taken, and a small lighted wax

candle ﬁxed in it; let the candle-holder be placed in a broad shallow bowl,

and a moderate amount of spirit of wine be poured around it, but not

enough to reach the lip of the candle-holder; then light the spirit of wine.

The spirit of wine will give a bluish ﬂame, while the candle lamp gives a

yellower one. Notice then whether the lamp ﬂame (which it is easy to

distinguish from the ﬂame of the spirit of wine by the colour; for ﬂames,

like liquids, do not mingle instantly) remains pyramidal, or whether rather

it tends more to the shape of a globe, since there is nothing there to destroy

or compress it. And if the latter occurs, it is to be laid down as certain that

the ﬂame remains numerically identical so long as it is wrapped up in the

other ﬂame.

And so much for crucial instances. We have deliberately taken quite a long

time to deal with them, so that men may gradually learn the habit of form-

ing judgements of a nature by crucial instances and illuminating experi-

ments, and not by probable reasoning.

XXXVII

As ﬁfteenth of the privileged instances I will put instances of divergence63

which indicate separations of natures which most commonly occur.64 They

63 instantiae divortii

64 or possibly ‘occur together'



Book II

diﬀer from the instances appended to the instances of association65 because

they declare the separation of a nature from a concrete object with which

it is normally found, while the latter point to the separation of one nature

from another. They are also diﬀerent from crucial instances; because they

settle nothing, but merely point to a separation of one nature from another.

Their value lies in showing up false forms, and in making short work of

hasty reﬂections inspired by passing objects; so that, we may say, they add

lead and weights to the intellect.66

For example: let the natures under investigation be the four natures

which Telesio67 regards as house companions and, one might say, from the

same room, viz. heat, brightness, subtlety, mobility or readiness for motion.

Many, many instances of separation are found among them. For air is

subtle and apt to move, but not hot or bright; the moon is bright, without

heat; boiling water hot, without light; the motion of the iron needle on a

pivot is quivering and agile, though in a substance which is cold, dense and

opaque; there are quite a few other examples.

Similarly, let the natures under investigation be physical body and

natural action. Natural action seems only to occur when existing in a body.

Even so there might perhaps be an instance of divergence in this matter. This

is the magnetic action by which iron is drawn towards a magnet, heavy

objects towards the globe of the earth. We might add some other operations

at a distance. For such action happens both in time, at intervals and not at

one point of time, and in space, by degrees and through distances. There

is therefore some moment of time and some interval of space in which the

force or action hangs in the midst between the two bodies which are causing

the motion. Hence our reﬂection is focused on this question: whether the

bodies which are the terminals of the motion aﬀect or alter the bodies

between, so that the force moves from one terminal to the other by succes-

sion and true contact, and for a time subsists in the body between; or is

there nothing there but bodies and forces and spaces? And in optical rays

and sounds and heat and some other things that work at a distance, it is

probable that the bodies in between are aﬀected and altered: the more so as

this requires a medium suited to carrying such an operation. But magnetic

or connective force is indiﬀerent as to medium, and the force is not

impeded in any kind of medium. But if the force or action has nothing in

The New Organon

common with the intervening body, it follows that it is a natural force or

action subsisting for some time in some space without a body, since it is not

subsisting either in the terminals or in the medium. And thus magnetic

action may be an instance of divergence in a physical substance and a natural

action. Something should be added to this as a corollary or beneﬁt not to

be missed: that even in philosophising on the basis of the senses, one may

have proof that there are separate and incorporeal entities and substances.

For if the natural force and action which emanate from a body could subsist

in some time and place wholly without a body, it is also close to being able

to emanate in its origin from an incorporeal substance. For physical

substance seems no less required for sustaining and carrying natural action

than for initiating or generating it.

XXXVIII

There follow ﬁve sets of instances which we have chosen to call in one

general word instances of the lamp or of ﬁrst information. They are those

which assist the senses. Since all interpretation of nature begins from the

senses, and runs by a straight, even, well-made road from perceptions of

the senses to perceptions of the intellect, which are true notions and

axioms, it is necessary that the fuller and more exact the presentations or

exhibits of the senses themselves are, the more easily and successfully

everything will go.

Of these ﬁve instances of the lamp, the ﬁrst set strengthen, enlarge and

correct the immediate actions of sense; the second make the non-sensible

sensible; the third point to continuous processes or series of things and

motions which (in general) are only noticed at their departure or in their

high points; the fourth provide a substitute for the senses where the senses

can do nothing at all; the ﬁfth attract the attention and observation of the

senses, and at the same time limit the subtlety of things. And now we must

speak of each one individually.

XXXIX

As sixteenth of the privileged instances we shall place instances that open

doors or gates;68 this is the name we give to those instances that assist direct

68 instantiae januae sive portae



Book II

actions of sense. It is evident that sight holds ﬁrst place among the senses,

as far as information is concerned; and so this is the sense for which we

must ﬁrst ﬁnd aids. There appear to be three kinds of aids: either to see

what has not been seen; or to see further; or to see more accurately and

distinctly.

Apart from spectacles and such things, whose function is simply to

correct and alleviate the weakness of impaired vision, and so provide no

new information, an instance of the ﬁrst kind are microscopes, lately

invented, which (by remarkably increasing the size of the specimens) reveal

the hidden, invisible small parts of bodies, and their latent structures and

motions. By their means the exact shape and features of the body in the ﬂea,

the ﬂy and worms are viewed, as well as colours and motions not previously

visible, to our great amazement. Furthermore, they say that a straight line

drawn by a pen or pencil is seen through such magnifying glasses to be very

uneven and wavy; evidently, because neither the movements of the hand,

even when assisted by a ruler, nor the impression of the ink or of the colour

are really true, though the irregularities are so small that they cannot be

seen without the aid of such microscopes. In this matter too men have

provided a kind of superstitious commentary (as usual with new and

strange matters), viz. that such microscopes illustrate works of nature but

discredit works of art. But this is simply because natural textures are much

more subtle than artiﬁcial textures. For this microscope is only good for

tiny things; if Democritus had seen a magnifying glass, he would perhaps

have jumped for joy, thinking a means of viewing the atom (which he

aﬃrmed was quite unseeable) had been invented. But the inadequacy of

such microscopes except for tiny things (and not for tiny things if they are

in a larger body) destroys the use of the thing. For if the invention could be

extended to larger bodies, or small bits of larger bodies, so that we could

see the texture of linen cloth as a net, and in this way make out the tiny,

hidden features and irregularities of gems, liquids, urine, blood, wounds

and many other things, we could undoubtedly derive great beneﬁts from

this invention.

Of the second kind is the other magnifying glass, Galileo's great achieve-

ment,69 telescope, with whose help we may open up and practise a closer

approach to the stars, as if by ferries or dinghies. For it establishes that the

galaxy is a knot or heap of small stars, which are plainly separate and distinct,

69 Galileo Galilei (–) of Padua. Bacon gives him the credit for the invention of the telescope;

Galileo presented one to the doge of Venice in .



The New Organon

of which the ancients had only a suspicion. It also appears to demonstrate

that the spaces between the so-called orbits of the planets are not wholly

empty of other stars, but that the heaven begins to be starry before you get

to the starry heaven itself; though with smaller stars than can be seen with-

out this telescope. With it one may view the choirs of small stars around

the planet Jupiter (and may conjecture from this that there is more than

one centre in the motions of the stars). With it the irregularities in the light

and dark areas of the moon are more distinctly seen and located; so that a

kind of map of the moon may be made. With it one may see the spots in the

sun, and things of that kind: all certainly noble discoveries, so far as one

may safely credit such demonstrations. But we are very suspicious of such

things, because experience stops with these few things, and not many other

things which equally deserve investigation have been discovered by the

same means.

Of the third kind are rods for measuring the earth, astrolabes and so on,

which do not enlarge the sense of sight, but correct and focus it. If there

are other instances which assist the other senses in their direct, individual

actions, still they do not contribute to our project unless they are such as to

add to the actual stock of information which we now have. And so I have

not mentioned them.

XL

In the seventeenth place among the privileged instances we shall put

summoning instances,70 a word we take from the civil courts, because they

summon things to present themselves which have not previously done so;

we have also chosen to call them citing instances. They make sensible the

non-sensible.

Things escape the senses either because the object is placed at a distance,

or because the senses are obstructed by bodies between themselves and the

object, or because the objects are not capable of making an impression on

the senses, or because the quantity of the object is not suﬃcient to strike

the senses, or because the time is insuﬃcient to activate the senses, or

because the senses cannot stand the eﬀect of the object, or because an object

has previously ﬁlled and possessed the senses so that there is no room for

another motion. These factors pertain primarily to sight, and secondly to

70 instantiae citantes



Book II

touch. These two senses are informative in a broad way about ordinary

objects; whereas the other three barely give any information except directly

and about objects peculiar to each sense.

() In the ﬁrst case, a thing is conveyed to the senses only if the object

that cannot be seen has something added or substituted for it which can

alert and impress the senses from a distance: such as in carrying news by

means of ﬁres, bells and so on.

() In the second case, conveyance takes place when things which are

kept hidden by the obstruction of a body, and cannot be easily exhibited,

are brought before the senses by things which are on the surface, or which

come out from inside: as the condition of a human body is revealed by the

pulse, the urine and so on.

(, ) Conveyances of the third and fourth kinds apply to many objects;

in the inquiry into nature we must always be alert for them. Here are some

examples. It is evident that air and spirit and things of that kind which are

tenuous and subtle throughout cannot be seen or touched. It is absolutely

necessary to make use of conveyances in investigating such substances.

Suppose the nature under investigation is the action and motion of spirit

enclosed in a tangible body. For every tangible body on earth contains an

invisible and intangible spirit; the body envelops and clothes it. This is

the powerful source of three eﬀects, the marvellous process of spirit in a

tangible body: when the spirit within a tangible thing is released, it contracts

and dries up the body; when it is kept in, it softens and melts them; and

when it is neither completely released nor wholly kept in, it shapes them,

gives them limbs, absorbs, consumes, organises, and so on. All this is

conveyed to the senses by the visible eﬀects.

For in every tangible and inanimate body, enclosed spirit ﬁrst multiplies

and feeds on the tangible parts which are most ready and available, and

digests and dissolves them, and turns them into spirit, and then they escape

together. This multiplication and dissolution by spirit is conveyed to the

senses by loss of weight. For when anything dries up, something is lost from

its quantity; and the loss is not so much from the spirit which was previously

in it, but from the substance which formerly was tangible and has just been

converted; for spirit has no weight. The exit or release of spirit is conveyed

to sense in the rusting of metals and other kinds of decomposition which

stop before they reach the rudiments of life; for the latter belong to the

third type of process. For in compact substances the spirit ﬁnds no pores

or pathways to get out by, and is therefore compelled to force tangible parts



The New Organon

out and push them before it, so that they come out with it; and that is how

rust and such things occur. Contraction of tangible parts after release of

some part of the spirit (which is followed by drying up) is conveyed to the

sense by an increase in the hardness of the thing, but much more by the

consequent splitting, shrinking, wrinkling and folding in bodies. Bits

of wood shrivel and shrink; skins wrinkle; and not only that, but (after a

sudden release of spirit by the heat of a ﬁre) they are so keen to contract

that they wind around themselves and curl up.

By contrast, when the spirit is kept in while being expanded and stimu-

lated by heat or something analogous (as in the case of substances which

are quite solid or tenacious), then the bodies are softened, like red-hot iron;

they ﬂow, like metals; they liquefy, like gums, wax and so on. Thus the

contrary eﬀects of heat (some things being hardened by it, others liqueﬁed)

are easily explained; in the former case the spirit is released, in the latter it

is stimulated but kept in. The latter is the action of the heat and spirit

themselves; the former is the action of the tangible parts, the release of the

spirit being merely the occasion.

But when spirit is neither wholly kept in nor wholly released, but only

struggles and strives71 within its bounds, and has possession of tangible

parts which are obedient and tractable, so that where spirit leads, they

immediately follow, the result is the formation of an organic body, the

development of limbs and other activities of life, in both vegetables and

animals. These things are best conveyed to the senses by careful observa-

tions of the earliest beginnings and rudiments or attempts at life in the tiny

creatures which are born from putrefaction: as ants' eggs, worms, ﬂies,

frogs after rain, etc. For life to occur there has to be gentle heat and a

pliant body, so that the spirit may not break out in a hurry, nor be prevented

by the resistance of the parts from folding and fashioning them like wax.

Again, a great many instances of conveyance bring before our eyes the

most remarkable and most wide-ranging of the distinctions between spirits:

isolated spirit, simply branching spirit, and spirit which is both branching

and cellular; of which the ﬁrst is the spirit of all inanimate bodies, the

second that of vegetables, the third that of animals.

It is likewise obvious that the more subtle structures and ﬁgures of things

are not perceived or touched, though the bodies are completely visible

or tangible. And therefore in these cases too information gets through by

71 ‘struggles and strives' (Kitchin)



Book II

conveyance. But the most radical and primary diﬀerence between struc-

tures depends on the greater or lesser amount of matter occupying the

same space or dimension. All other ﬁgures (which are attributable to the

particular features of the parts contained in the same body, and their

relative places and positions) are secondary to this one.

Suppose the nature under investigation is expansion or contraction of

matter in bodies respectively: viz. how much matter ﬁlls what dimension

in individual things. For nothing is truer in nature than the double propo-

sition that ‘nothing comes from nothing', nor ‘is anything reduced to

nothing',72 but a given quantity of matter or the total amount is constant,

and neither increases nor diminishes. It is no less true, that ‘from a given

quantity of matter more or less is contained within the same spaces

and dimensions, in accordance with the diﬀerences between bodies'; for

example, there is more in water and less in air. Hence to claim that a given

volume of water can be turned into an equal volume of air is like saying that

something can be reduced to nothing; and on the other hand to claim that

a given volume of air can be turned into an equal volume of water is like

saying that something can come from nothing. And the notions of density

and rarity, which are loosely taken in various ways, should properly be

derived from the larger and smaller amount of matter. We should also take

up a third claim which is also quite certain, that the amount of matter

which we say is in this or that substance can be reduced (by comparison) to

numbers, to exact or nearly exact measurements. For example, it would not

be wrong to say that in a given quantity of gold there is such an accumula-

tion of matter that spirit of wine needs twenty-one times as much space as

the gold ﬁlls, to equal that quantity of matter.

Now the accumulation of matter and its measures are conveyed to sense

by weight. For weight corresponds to the amount of matter, so far as the

tangible parts of it are concerned, and spirit, and its material quantity, do

not come into the computation as weight; for it lightens the weight rather

than increases it. We have made a quite accurate table of this thing, in which

we have put down the weights and spaces of each metal, of the principal

stones, woods, liquids, oils, and most other bodies, both natural and artiﬁ-

cial: a thing of many uses,73 both to provide illuminating information and

to give a guide for operation; and which reveals much that is quite contrary

to expectation. It is also valuable in demonstrating that the full range of

72 Bacon is here paraphrasing well-known scholastic axioms.

The New Organon

tangible bodies known to us (meaning compact bodies, not highly porous

bodies, hollow and largely ﬁlled with air) does not exceed the ratio of :;

so limited is nature, or at least that part of it which is most relevant to our

experience.

We have also thought it worth our while to see whether we could perhaps

determine the ratio of intangible bodies to tangible bodies. We attempted

this with the following contrivance. We took a small glass bottle, which

could hold perhaps one ounce (we used a small vessel so that the conse-

quent evaporation could be achieved with less heat). We ﬁlled this bottle

with spirit of wine almost to the brim; selecting spirit of wine because we

observed by means of an earlier table74 that it is the rarest of the tangible

bodies (which are continuous, not porous), and contains the least matter

for its dimensions. Then we accurately noted the weight of the liquid75 with

the bottle itself. Next we took a bladder which would hold about two pints.

We expelled all the air from it, so far as possible, to the point that the sides

of the bladder were touching each other; we had also previously smeared

the bladder with a grease, rubbing it gently in so that it would be more

eﬀectively closed, its porosity, if there was any, being sealed by the oil. We

tied this bladder tightly around the mouth of the bottle, with its mouth

inside the mouth of the bladder, lightly waxing the thread so that it would

stick better and bind more tightly. Finally we placed the bottle above burn-

ing coals in a brazier. Very soon a steam or breath of spirit of wine,

expanded by heat and turned into gaseous form, gradually inﬂated the

bladder, and stretched the whole thing in every direction like a sail. As soon

as this happened, we removed the glass from the ﬁre, and placed it on a rug

so that it would not be cracked by the cold; we also immediately made a

hole in the top of the bladder, so that when the heat ceased, the steam would

not return to liquid form and run down and spoil the measurement. Then

we lifted up the bladder itself and again took the weight of the spirit of wine

which remained. Then we calculated how much had been used up as

steam or gas; and making a comparison as to how much place or space that

substance had ﬁlled in the bottle when it was spirit of wine, and then how

much space it ﬁlled after it had become gas in the bladder, we calculated the

ratio; and it was absolutely clear that the substance thus converted and

changed had achieved a hundredfold expansion over its previous state.

Similarly, suppose the nature under investigation is heat or cold in

75 Translating aquae (water), but presumably ‘spirit of wine' is intended.

Book II

degrees too weak to be perceived by the senses. These are conveyed to sense

by a thermometer, such as we described above. For heat and cold are not

perceptible to touch in themselves, but heat expands air and cold contracts

it. And in turn it is not the expansion or contraction of the air which is

perceptible to sight, but expanded air forces the water down, contracted air

raises it; conveyance to the sight occurs only at that point, not before and

not in any other way.

Similarly, suppose the nature under investigation is mixture of sub-

stances: i.e. what watery substance they contain, what oily substance, what

spirit, ash, salt and so on; or (to take a case) what milk contains of butter,

curds, whey and so on. These are conveyed to the sense by skilfully con-

trived separations, so far as their tangible elements are concerned. The

nature of the spirit in them is not directly perceived, but detected in the

various movements and tendencies which the tangible substances exhibit

in the very act and process of their separation, and also in the bitterness,

bite and diﬀerent colours, smells and tastes of the same substances after

the separation. And in this task men have surely made vigorous eﬀorts, by

distillations and contrived separations, but with no more success than in

their usual manner of experimentation: groping methods, blind ways, more

eﬀort than intelligence, and (what is worst) no imitation or emulation of

nature, but destruction (by high heat or excessively strong forces) of all the

more subtle structure in which the hidden powers of things and their

agreements chieﬂy lie. And the other caution we have given elsewhere76

never troubles their thoughts or observations in such separations, that in

the violent operations they perform on bodies, whether by ﬁre or in other

ways, many qualities are caused by the ﬁre itself and by the substances

used to make the analysis which were not in the compound before. Hence

amazing errors. For instance, not all the steam which is released from water

by ﬁre was either steam or air previously in the substance of the water, but

was formed for the most part by the expansion of the water by the heat of

the ﬁre.

Similarly, in general, this is the place to bring in all the reﬁned ways of

testing substances, whether natural or artiﬁcial, by which the true is

distinguished from the adulterated, good quality from poor; for they

convey the non-sensible to the sensible. They should therefore be sought

everywhere with care and industry.

76 ..

() As for the ﬁfth way in which things hide themselves, it is obvious that

the action of the senses occurs as motion, and motion occurs in time. If the

motion of a body is either so slow or so fast that it is too slow or too fast to

suit the speed at which the action of the senses takes place, the object is not

perceived at all; as in the motion of the hand of a clock, or the movement of

a bullet. The movement which is not seen because it is too slow is easily, and

commonly, conveyed to the senses by the sum of its motions; motions which

are too fast have not been able to be measured properly up to our time; how-

ever, the investigation of nature requires us to do this in some cases.

() The sixth case, where the sense is stymied by the object's power,

achieves conveyance either by moving the object further away from the

senses, or by dulling its eﬀect by putting some barrier in front of it such as

would weaken it without destroying it; or by admitting and receiving a

reﬂection of it when the force of a direct strike would be too strong, like the

reﬂection of the sun in a bowl of water.

() The seventh case in which an object fails to show up is the case where

the sense is so oppressed by an object that there is no opportunity for any

other object to make itself felt; this is more or less conﬁned to smells and

odours, and is not very relevant to the discussion. So much for the ways in

which the non-sensible is conveyed to the sensible.

Sometimes a conveyance is made not to a man's sense, but to the sense

of some other animal, which in some cases surpasses the human senses. For

example, the conveyance of some smells to the sense of a dog; and of the

light which exists latently in air which is not illuminated from outside itself,

to the sense of a cat, an owl and other animals which see at night. Telesius

rightly noted that there is indeed a kind of original light in the air itself,

though weak and feeble and for the most part no use to the eyes of men or

of most animals, because the animals whose senses are adapted to this kind

of light see at night; and it is scarcely credible that this happens without

light or by an internal light.

In any case, note that we are dealing here only with the defects of the

senses and their remedies. For the errors of the senses should be assigned

to the actual investigations of sense and the sensible; with the exception of

the great error of the senses, that they set the outlines of things by the

pattern of man, not of the universe;77 which can only be corrected by

universal reason and a universal philosophy.

In eighteenth place among the privileged instances we shall set instances of

the road ,78 which we have also chosen to call travelling instances and jointed

instances. They are instances which indicate discretely continuous motions

in nature. This kind of instance rather avoids observation than sense. Men

are wonderfully inattentive here. In fact they observe nature only in a

desultory and casual manner and after bodies are ﬁnished and complete,

and not in its working. If you wanted to see the skills of a craftsman and

observe his work, you would not only want to view the unformed materials

of his craft, but also be there when he was at work himself and shaping

his product. One must do something like that with regard to nature. For

example, anyone investigating the growth of plants must observe it from

the sowing of the seed on (this can easily be done by taking up, more or less

every day, seeds which have been in the ground for two days, three days,

four days and so on, and by carefully studying them); he must observe how

and when the seed begins to bulge, swell and be ﬁlled with spirit (so to

speak); and then how it begins to break the husk and put out shoots, at

the same time pushing its way upwards a little bit unless the soil is very

heavy; and how it also puts out shoots, some downwards for the roots, and

some upwards as stems, and sometimes creeps sideways if it can ﬁnd

open and easier soil in that direction; and there are several other things

he should observe. One should do the same for the hatching of eggs,

where the process of life beginning and taking shape easily oﬀers itself to

view, and what and which parts come from the yolk, and what comes from

the white of the egg, and so on. Animals from putrefaction oﬀer a similar

method. It would be inhuman to make such investigations of well-formed

animals ready for birth by cutting the foetuses out of the womb, except for

accidental abortions and in hunting and so on. And therefore one should

keep a kind of round-the-clock watch on nature, since it oﬀers itself for

inspection better at night than in the day. For these observations might be

regarded as nocturnal, because the lamp is so small yet everlit.

The same thing should be tried in the case of inanimate things, as we did

in investigating the expansion of liquids through ﬁre.79 For there is one

mode of expansion in water, another in wine, another in vinegar, another

in the juice of grapes, and a very diﬀerent one in milk, oil and so on. This

would be easy to see by boiling them in a glass vessel on a slow ﬁre, where

everything could be clearly seen. We are simply skimming this subject; we

will discuss it more precisely and at greater length when we reach the

discovery of the latent process of things. For we must always bear in mind

that we are not dealing with the things themselves here, but only giving

examples.

XLII

In the nineteenth place among the privileged instances we shall put instances

of supplement or substitution,80 which we have also chosen to call instances of

last resort. They are the instances which supply information when the

senses draw a total blank, and therefore we resort to them when we have

been unable to get proper instances. This substitution happens in two

ways; either by degrees or through analogies. For example: there is no

medium found which completely stops the operation of a magnet in

moving iron; you cannot do it by putting gold or silver between them, or

stone or glass, or wood, water, oil, cloth or ﬁbrous materials, or air or ﬂame,

and so on. And yet some medium might perhaps be found, by careful test-

ing, which could dull its power more than anything else, relatively and in

some degree: for instance, one might discover that a magnet does not draw

iron through such a thickness of gold as it does through an equal distance

of air; or through so much heated silver as cold silver; and so on in like

cases. We have not made experiments with these; we simply include them

as examples. Similarly, no body is found in human experience which does

not take heat when brought near a ﬁre. But air takes heat much more

quickly than stone. Such is the substitution by degrees.

Substitution by analogy is certainly useful but less sure, and therefore

must be used with some discretion. It occurs when a non-sensible thing

is brought before the senses, not by sensible activity on the part of the

insensible substance itself, but by observation of a related sensible body; for

example, if in an investigation of a mixture of spirits, which are non-

visible bodies, some kind of relationship is apparent between the bodies and

their fuel or nourishment. The fuel of ﬂames seems to be oil and fatty

substances; of air, water and watery substances; for ﬂames intensify over

oil fumes, and air feeds on water vapour. We should therefore study the

80 instantiae supplementi, sive substitutionis



Book II

mixture of water and oil, which is accessible to the senses, because a mix-

ture of air and ﬁre escapes the senses. But oil and water mix with each other

very imperfectly when combined or stirred, but in grass, blood and the

parts of animals the same things mix fully and smoothly. And therefore

something similar could be the case in a mixture of ﬁery and airy parts in

spirits: things which do not easily hold a mixture when simply poured

together seem to mix in the spirits of plants and animals, especially as every

living spirit takes in both kinds of moisture, the watery and the fatty, as

fuel.

Similarly, we may be investigating not a relatively complete mixture

of spirits, but a mere combination, that is whether spirits are readily

incorporated into each other, or whether (for example) there are some

winds and vapours or other spirituous bodies which do not mix with

ordinary air, but only hang and ﬂoat in it, in globules and drops, and are

smashed and shattered by air, not welcomed and incorporated. This is not

perceptible to the senses in ordinary air and other spirituous bodies,

because they are too subtle; however, a kind of image of the thing, so far

as it happens, may be drawn from the liquids quicksilver, oil and water;

and also from the breakup of air when it is dispersed and rises through

water in small particles; also in thick smoke; and ﬁnally in disturbed dust

ﬂoating in the air; in all of which there is no incorporation. The presenta-

tion we made on this subject is not bad, provided a careful inquiry is ﬁrst

made whether there can be such heterogeneity among spirits as is found

among liquids; for in that case substituting these images by analogy will

not be inappropriate.

We have said that information may be got from these supplemental

instances as a last resort when direct instances are lacking. But we also want

to make it clear that they are also very useful when direct instances are

available, for conﬁrming the information along with the direct instances.

But we will explain them more exactly when the regular course of our

discussion brings us to a treatment of the supports of induction.

In the twentieth place among the privileged instances we shall put cleaving

instances,81 which we have also chosen to call plucking instances, but for a

81 instantiae persecantes

diﬀerent reason. We call them plucking instances because they pluck at

the mind, cleaving because they cleave nature apart; so too we sometimes

call them instances of Democritus.82 They are instances which remind the

intellect of the exquisite subtlety of nature, so that it is excited and

prompted to give nature the attention, observation and scrutiny it deserves.

For example: that a little drop of ink can make so many letters or lines; that

a piece of silver, gilded only on the outside, makes such a length of gilt wire;

that a tiny little worm such as is found in the skin contains spirit and a

distinct structure of parts; that a little saﬀron stains and colours a whole

barrel of water; that a little civet or perfume ﬁlls a far greater quantity of

air with its smell; that a little fumigant makes such a cloud of smoke; that

the precise discriminations of sound articulated by voices speaking are

somehow carried through the air, and penetrate even the passages and

pores of wood and water (though in diminished form), and indeed are

echoed back so swiftly and distinctly; that light and colour rapidly permeate,

even at a great distance, the solid substance of glass and water, and ﬁll it

with such an exquisite variety of images, and are also refracted and

reﬂected; that a magnet is eﬀective through every kind of body, even the

most solid. More wonderfully still, in all these things, the action of one of

them in a neutral medium such as air does not greatly impede another;

so that at the same time the spaces of the air carry so many images of

visible things, so many resonations of voices speaking, and so many distinct

perfumes, as of the violet and the rose; also heat and cold and magnetic

powers; all (I repeat) at the same time, and without obstructing each other,

as if each one had its own ways and private paths apart, and none touched

or crossed any other.

But there is a useful appendix to add to cleaving instances, and that is

what we call the limits of dissection; that in the things we have spoken of, an

action does not impede or disturb a diﬀerent kind of action, but may sub-

due and extinguish another action of the same kind: as the light of the sun

does to the light of a candle; the sound of a bomb to the voice; or as a

stronger odour overcomes a more delicate one; and intenser heat a lesser

heat; and sheets of iron put between a magnet and another piece of iron

impedes the operation of the magnet. The proper place to deal with these

will also be among the supports of induction.

We have now dealt with the instances which aid the senses, which are of

particular value for the informative part of our enterprise. For information

starts from sense. But the enterprise as a whole ends in works; this is the

end of the thing, as information is the beginning. Instances therefore will

follow which are of particular value for the applied part. They are of two

kinds, and there are seven of them. We have chosen to give all of them the

general name of practical instances. There are two faults in the operative

part, and the same number of leading instances in general. For either an

operation fails or causes too much labour. The major reason why an

operation fails (especially if there has been a careful search for the natures)

is that the strengths and actions of the bodies have not been properly

determined and measured. The strengths and actions of bodies are

described and measured by dimensions of space, or by moments of time,

or by units of quantity, or by the dominance of a power;83 if these four

factors are not honestly and carefully measured, it will perhaps make a

pretty, speculative science, but it will be empty of results. Likewise we

give the four instances which correspond to these the single name of

mathematical instances, and instances of measurement.

Practice becomes laborious, either because of a clutter of useless subjects

or an excessive number of instruments, or because of the mass of matter

and substances which happen to be required for some task. Therefore we

should value instances which either direct the operative function to things

of most value for men, or which keep down the number of instruments, or

which economise on material or equipment. The three instances which

belong here we call by the one name of propitious or benevolent instances.

And therefore we shall now speak of these seven instances one by one; and

with them we shall close this part of the privileged or leading instances.

XLV

In the twenty-ﬁrst place among the privileged instances we shall put instances

of the rod or of the ruler,84 which we have also chosen to call instances of range

or furthest limit. For the powers and motions of things work and have eﬀect

at distances which are not indeﬁnite and a matter of chance, but are ﬁxed

83 These subjects are dealt with in ., ,  and , respectively.

84 instantiae virgae, sive radii

and deﬁnite. It is of great practical value to observe and note them in

each nature we seek, not only to avoid error in practice but also to improve

practice and extend its power. For there is sometimes the opportunity to

enlarge powers and draw distances closer, as in the case of magnifying

glasses.85

Most powers operate and have an eﬀect on other things only by open

contact, as in the case of the collision of bodies, when one body does not

move the other without the striking body actually touching the body

struck. Also medicines applied from the exterior, like ointments and plasters,

only exercise their powers by bodily contact. The objects of the senses of

touch and taste aﬀect them only when they are close to the organs.

There are other powers which work at a distance, albeit a very small dis-

tance. Few have yet been noted, though there are more than men imagine.

For instance (to take examples from common objects), amber or jet attracts

straws, a bubble bursts another bubble when it gets close to it, certain

purgatives draw down rheum, and so on. And the magnetic power which

draws iron to a magnet or draws magnets to each other works within a

certain range of power, though a small one; whereas if there is a magnetic

power proceeding from the earth itself (evidently just below the surface)

on to an iron needle and aﬀecting its polarity, the eﬀect would be working

at a great distance.

Again, if there is any magnetic force operating by agreement between

the globe of the earth and heavy things, or between the globe of the moon

and the waters of the sea (which seems very likely in the high and low tides

twice a month), or between the starry heaven and the planets, by which

they are called up and raised to their apogees; all these things would be

operating at very great distances. There are also some cases of ﬁres start-

ing or breaking out in some materials at quite large distances, as they report

of the naphtha at Babylon. For heat travels vast distances, and so does cold:

the inhabitants of Canada feel from far away the cold given oﬀ by the

masses or bulks of ice which break oﬀ and ﬂoat through the northern ocean

and move down through the Atlantic towards their shores. Odours too

are eﬀective at remarkable distances (though there seems to be also some

physical emission in their case), as noted by sailors along the coasts of

Florida or some parts of Spain, where there are whole forests of lemon

trees, orange trees and such fragrant plants, or stands of rosemary,

85 See ..



Book II

marjoram and so on. Finally, light radiation and sound impressions work

at considerable distances.

But whether the distance at which they work is great or small, all these

things certainly work at distances which are ﬁxed and known to nature, so

that there is a kind of No Further which is in proportion to the mass or

quantity of the bodies; or to the vigour or weakness of their powers; or to

the assistance or resistance of the surrounding medium; all of which should

come into the calculation and be noted. Furthermore we should also note

the measures of the so-called violent motions, as of missiles, cannon,

wheels and so on, since they clearly have their ﬁxed limits also.

There are also certain motions and powers which are contrary to those

which operate on contact and not at a distance: i.e. those which operate at

a distance and not by contact, and those which operate weakly at a short

distance and more strongly at a greater distance. Vision for instance is not

communicated well by contact but needs a medium and a distance. But I

do remember having heard a story from someone who deserved to be

believed, that when he had the cataracts on his eyes treated (the treatment

was to insert a little silver needle under the ﬁrst membrane of the eye, to

remove the ﬁlm of the cataract and push it into the corner of the eye) he

saw the needle moving over the actual pupil very clearly. However true this

may be, it is obvious that larger objects are not well or clearly seen except

at the point of a cone, where the rays from the object meet at some distance.

Furthermore, in old people the eye sees better when the object is placed a

little further away than nearer. And in the case of missiles it is certain that

the impact is not so great at a very short distance as it is a little way away.

These and similar things are what we should note in measuring motions

with regard to distance.

There is also another kind of spatial measurement of motion which

should not be ignored. This belongs not to linear motions but to spherical

motions, i.e. to the expansion of bodies into a larger sphere, or their con-

traction into a smaller. Among these measurements of motion we must ask

how much compression or expansion bodies easily and freely allow (in

accordance with their natures), and at what point they begin to resist, so

that at the extreme they bear it No Further; as when an inﬂated bladder is

compressed, it tolerates some compression of the air, but after a point it can

bear it no longer, and the bladder bursts.

We have tested this more precisely with a subtle experiment. We took a

small metal bell, quite thin and light, like a saltcellar, and sank it in a basin



The New Organon

of water, so that it took with it to the bottom of the basin the air held in its

cavity. We had ﬁrst placed a little ball on the bottom of the basin on which

to set the bell. The result was that if the ball was quite small (in relation to

the cavity) the air retreated into a smaller area, and was simply compressed

and not expelled. But if it was too large for the air to give way freely, then

the air could not tolerate the greater pressure but partially lifted the little

bell and came up in bubbles.

To ﬁnd out what extension (no less than compression) air would permit,

we did the following experiment. We took a glass egg with a little hole at

one end of it. We drew the air through the hole by strong suction, and

immediately blocked the hole with a ﬁnger, and immersed the egg in water,

and then removed the ﬁnger. The air was put under pressure by the tension

induced by the suction, and swollen beyond its own nature, and in striving

to draw back and contract (so that if the egg had not been immersed in

water, it would have drawn air itself in with a whistle) it drew in a suﬃcient

quantity of water for the air to recover its former sphere or dimension.

It is also certain that the more tenuous bodies (like air) permit some

noticeable contraction, as has been said; but tangible substances (like water)

permit compression with much more reluctance and to a lesser degree.

How much it permits was the object of this experiment.

We had a hollow globe made of lead, to hold about two vintners' pints,

and with sides thick enough to bear considerable force. We put water into

it through a hole made in it; and after the globe ﬁlled with water, we sealed

the hole with liquid lead, so that it became a completely solid globe. Then

we ﬂattened the globe on two opposite sides with a heavy hammer; as a

result of which the water had to be contracted into a smaller space, since a

sphere is the most capacious of shapes. Then when hammering could do

no more, as the water was resisting retreat, we used a mill or screw press;

so that at last the water could tolerate no more pressure, and distilled

through the solid surface of the lead (like a light dew). Then we calculated

how much the space had been reduced by the compression; and inferred

that the water (but only when submitted to so much force) had suﬀered

that amount of compression.

More solid, dry or compact materials, such as stone and wood, and also

metals, tolerate much less compression or extension; in fact, it is almost

imperceptible; they free themselves by breaking, by moving, or other

manoeuvres, as appears in bending wood or metal, in clocks that move by

the winding of a spring, in projectiles, in hammering and in countless other



Book II

motions. All these things with their measurements should be noted and

tested in the hunt for nature, either in their own exact form, or by estimate,

or by comparison, as opportunity arises.

XLVI

In the twenty-second place among privileged instances we shall put running

instances,86 which I have also chosen to call instances of water, taking the

term from the water clocks of the ancients, which were ﬁlled with water

rather than sand. They measure nature by moments of time, as instances of

the rod measure them by units of space. For every natural motion or action

passes in time, one more swiftly, another more slowly, yet all at moments

which are certain and known to nature. Even actions which seem to

happen instantly and in the twinkling of an eye (as we say) are found to

involve more or less of time.

First then we see that the revolutions of the heavenly bodies take place

at calculable intervals, and so do the ebb and ﬂow of the sea. The move-

ment of heavy things towards the earth and of light things towards the

circuit of the sky occupies certain moments determined by the body which

is moving and the medium through which it moves. The paths of ships, the

movements of animals, the courses of missiles, all likewise occupy lengths

of time which may be reckoned (in round terms). As far as heat goes, we

see boys wash their hands in ﬂames in winter and yet not be burned, and

jugglers make smooth, agile movements to turn jars full of wine or water

upside down and right way up again without spilling a drop; and much

of the same kind. Equally, the compression, expansion and eruption of

bodies happen quickly or slowly depending on the type of body and the

motion, but all take a certain amount of time. Further, in the explosion of

several cannon at the same time, which may sometimes be heard up to

thirty miles away, those who are near the spot where the sound occurred

hear it before those who are further away. And in sight (whose action is very

swift) it is also clear that certain moments of time are needed for it to act;

that is proved by things which are too swift to be seen, as by the path of a

bullet from a gun. For the bullet ﬂies past too fast for an impression of its

species to reach the eye.

This and other things have sometimes given us a quite fantastic doubt

86 instantiae curriculi



The New Organon

as to whether we see the face of the serene and starry heaven at the same

time as it truly exists, or some time later; and whether (so far as the sight

of heavenly bodies is concerned) there is both a true time and a perceived

time, as in the case of parallaxes, where astronomers have remarked that

there is a true place and a perceived place. So incredible did it seem to us

that the species or rays of celestial bodies could pass instantly to the sight

through such immense distances of miles, rather than travel in some

noticeable length of time. But that doubt (as to some appreciable interval

of time between the true time and the perceived time) later completely

vanished as we reﬂected on the inﬁnite loss and decrease of quantity, so far

as appearance goes, between the true body of the star and the image per-

ceived, which is caused by the distance; and noted also at what a distance

(a minimum of sixty miles) bodies which are merely white are instantly

seen here on earth, since there is no doubt that the light of the heavenly

bodies many times exceeds, in vigour of radiation, not only the brightness

of white, but also the light of every ﬂame known to us here on earth. Also

the immense velocity of the body itself as seen in its daily motion (which

has so amazed even serious thinkers that they would prefer to believe in the

motion of the earth) makes the motion of ray emission (marvellously fast,

as we said) more credible. But the most convincing point is that if some

noticeable interval of time were put between the reality and the sighting,

the species would frequently be intercepted and muddled by clouds

arising in the meantime and similar disturbances in the medium. So much

for simple measurements of time.

But we should investigate the measurement of motions and actions not

only in themselves but, much more, comparatively; this is supremely use-

ful and for many purposes. We see that the ﬂash of a gun ﬁring is seen more

quickly than the sound is heard, though the ball must have hit the air before

the ﬂame behind it could get out; and this must happen because of the

swifter passage of the motion of light than of the motion of sound. We see

also that visible images are taken up by sight more quickly than they are

discarded; which is why violin strings plucked with a ﬁnger are doubled or

tripled in appearance, because a new image is received before the old one

is discarded; hence rotating rings look like a globe, and a burning torch

carried swiftly at night seems to have a tail. On this foundation of the

unequal speed of motions Galileo built his conception of the ebb and ﬂow

of the sea: the earth rotates more swiftly, and water less swiftly, and so the

waters heap up and then in turn fall down again, as is displayed in a vase of



Book II

water moved rapidly. He achieved this ﬁction by granting himself the

ungrantable (namely that the earth moves), and without being well

informed on the six-hourly motion of the ocean.

We are discussing the comparative measure of motions, both in itself and

in its eminent utility (of which we spoke just now). A remarkable example

occurs in mines laid beneath the earth and ﬁlled with gunpowder; in which

a tiny quantity of gunpowder undermines and throws into the air immense

masses of earth, buildings and so on. The cause of it is certainly that the

expansive motion of the powder, which is the impelling force, is many times

swifter than the motion of gravity by which some resistance could be made;

so that the ﬁrst movement has ﬁnished its task before the contrary motion

begins; hence at the beginning there is an absence of resistance. This is also

the reason why in every missile, the blow, which is not so strong as it is

sharp and swift, has a very high projectile power. And the only reason

why a small quantity of animal spirits in animals, especially in such large-

bodied animals as whales or elephants, could steer and control such an

immense bodily mass is that spirit motion is very fast, and physical motion

is slow to exert resistance.

Finally, this is one of the main foundations of magic experiments, which

we shall discuss later, namely when a small amount of matter masters a

much larger amount and regulates it; this, I say, occurs if the one forestalls

the other with its speed of motion before the other gets moving.

One more thing: the before and after should be noted in every natural

action. For instance, in an infusion of rhubarb, the purgative force comes

out ﬁrst, and then the astringent; we have seen something similar in an

infusion of violets in vinegar, where the sweet, delicate scent of the ﬂower

is noticed ﬁrst and then the more earthy part of the ﬂower, which over-

whelms the scent. Hence if violets are infused for a whole day, the scent is

much weaker to notice; but if they are infused only for a quarter of an hour,

and then taken out, and (because there is little scented spirit within a violet)

new, fresh violets are infused, for a quarter of an hour each, six times; then

at last the infusion is made so strong that, though the violets are only in it

(one bunch at a time) for a total period of an hour and a half, still a very

pleasing scent, as good as the real violet's, lasts for a whole year. However,

one should note that the scent does not reach its full strength till a month

after the infusion. And in a distillation of aromatic spices soaked in spirit

of wine, it is evident that at ﬁrst a useless, watery ﬂuid develops, then water

with more spirit of wine in it, and only after that, water with more scent. A



The New Organon

great many such things are found in distillations and deserve to be noticed.

But this will be enough to give examples.

XLVII

In the twenty-third place among the privileged instances we shall put

instances of quantity,87 which we have also chosen to call doses of nature

(borrowing a term from medicine). These are the instances which measure

powers by the quantities of bodies, and indicate what quantity of a body

results in a certain amount of power. And ﬁrst there are some powers which

exist only in cosmic quantity, i.e. in a quantity which is consistent with the

shape and structure of the universe. For the earth stands, its parts fall.

Water in the sea ebbs and ﬂows, but not water in the rivers, except as the

sea ﬂows into them. Again, the eﬀect of almost all the powers depends on

whether there is a lot or a little of the substance. Large bodies of water are

not easily polluted, small ones quickly. Wine and beer mature and become

drinkable much more quickly in small leather bags than in large casks. If a

herb is placed in a larger amount of liquid, the herb is infused, and the

liquor is not absorbed; if in a smaller amount, there is no infusion and the

liquid is absorbed. In its eﬀect on the human body, a bath is one thing, a

light sprinkling another. Light dews in the air never fall; they are dissipated

and incorporated into the air. Breathing on a jewel, one may see that little

bit of moisture instantly dissolved, like a small cloud blown away by the

wind. Also a fragment of magnet does not attract so much iron as a whole

magnet. There are also powers in which a small quantity has the greater

eﬀect, as in making holes a sharp point pierces more quickly than a blunt

one, a pointed diamond engraves on glass, and so on.

But we should not linger too long on this; we have also to investigate the

proportion of quantity of body to amount of power. It would be natural to

think that the proportions of quantity equal the proportions of power; so

that if a lead ball weighing an ounce took a certain amount of time to fall, a

ball of two ounces should fall twice as quickly, which is quite wrong. Nor

do the same proportions hold in all the diﬀerent kinds of powers, but very

diﬀerent ones. And therefore we must look for these measures in the things

themselves, not on the basis of likelihood or conjecture.

And last, in every inquisition of nature we must note how much of a body

87 instantiae quanti



Book II

is needed for each particular eﬀect; and keep slipping in warnings about too

much and too little.

XLVIII

Twenty-fourth among the privileged instances we shall put instances of

struggle,88 which we have also chosen to call instances of dominance. They

point to alternating dominance and submission of powers, and indicate

which of them is stronger and prevails, and which is weaker and succumbs.

For the motions and exertions of bodies are compounded, decompounded

and combined with each other no less than the bodies themselves. We shall

therefore ﬁrst give an account of the main kinds of motion or active power,

in order to oﬀer a clearer comparison of their respective strengths, and on

that basis to exhibit and demarcate instances of struggle and dominance.

() Let the ﬁrst motion be the motion of the indestructibility of matter,

which exists in every little part of it, by which it utterly refuses to be

annihilated; so that no ﬁre, no weight, no pressure or violence, nor age nor

length of time, can reduce even the smallest particle of matter to nothing;

but it always is something and occupies some space, and (under any

necessity) either frees itself by changing its shape or place, or (if it has no

chance to do so) it remains as it is, and never gets to the point of being

nothing or nowhere. This motion the School (which nearly always names

and deﬁnes things rather by their eﬀects and negative consequences than by

their inner causes) either denotes by the axiom that ‘two bodies cannot be

in one place; or calls it the motion not to permit penetration of dimensions'.

We need not give examples of this motion: it is in every substance.

() Let the second motion be the motion we call bonding; by which bodies

refuse to be torn in any part of themselves from contact with another body,

as if they enjoy mutual bonding and contact. This motion the School calls

the motion to avoid a vacuum; as when water is drawn up by suction or

through a syringe, or ﬂesh by cupping-glasses; or when water stands and

fails to run out through a hole in a water pot unless the mouth of the jar is

opened to let in air; and innumerable such things.

() Let the third motion be the motion of liberty (as we call it); by which

bodies strive to free themselves from unnatural pressure or tension and to

restore themselves to the dimensions that suit their body. There are count-

88 instantiae luctae



The New Organon

less examples of this motion: as (for liberation from pressure) the example

of water in swimming, of the air in ﬂying; of water in rowing, of air in blasts

of wind; of the spring in clocks. The motion of compressed air shows itself

rather neatly in children's popguns, when they hollow out a length of alder

or some similar thing, and stop up both ends with a piece of some pulpy

root, or something of that kind; then with a ramrod they stuﬀ a root or some

such wad in at one end; the root at the other end is forced out and ejected

with an audible noise before being touched by the root or wad at the nearer

end, or with the ramrod. As for escape from tension, this motion shows

itself in the air which remains in glass eggs after extraction, and in strings,

leather and cloth which resume their shape when the stretching is ﬁnished,

unless it has lasted long enough to become permanent, etc. This motion

the School refers to under the name of motion from the form of the element:

ignorantly enough, since this motion has to do not only with air, water or

ﬁre, but with the whole spectrum of solid bodies, as wood, iron, lead, cloth,

parchment etc., in which each body has a limit of its own characteristic

dimension, and is with diﬃculty forced out of it to any noticeable extent.

But as the motion of liberation is the most evident of them, and has an

inﬁnite number of forms, it would be advisable to make some good, clear

distinctions. For some men carelessly confuse this motion with the dual

motion of indestructibility and bonding; i.e. they confuse liberation from

pressure with the motion of indestructibility, and liberation from tension

with the motion of bonding; as if bodies under compression submitted or

expanded to avoid penetration of dimensions, and bodies under tension

recoiled and contracted to avoid a vacuum. However, if compressed air

attempted to contract to the density of water, or wood to the density of

stone, there would be no need of penetration of dimensions, and yet it would

be a much greater compression of them than they in any way allow. In the

same way, if water tried to expand and achieve the rarity if air, or stone the

rarity of wood, there would be no need of a vacuum, yet there would be a

much greater extension of them than they in any way allow. Therefore this

is not a matter of penetration of dimensions and vacuum, except in the last

stages of condensation and rarefaction. These motions stay and stop long

before those stages are reached, and are simply the eﬀorts of bodies to keep

their own consistencies (or, if they89 prefer, their own forms) and not to lose

them suddenly unless they are altered by gentle means and with their own

89 ‘They' refers to the scholastics.



Book II

consent. But it is much more essential (because of the many consequences)

to impress upon men that violent motion (which we call mechanical, and

Democritus, who in explaining his ﬁrst motions is to be ranked even below

mediocre philosophers, called the motion of the blow) is simply a motion of

liberty, i.e. from compression to relaxation. For whether it is a simple

impulsion or a ﬂight through the air, there is no displacement or spatial

movement until parts of the body suﬀer unnaturally by compression by the

impellent. Then as each part pushes another one after the other, the whole

body moves; not only going forward but also rotating at the same time; so

that in this manner the parts too may be able to escape or share the burden

more equally. Enough on this motion.

() Let the fourth motion be the motion to which we have given the

name of matter.90 This motion is in some way the converse of the motion

of liberty just discussed. For in the motion of liberty bodies abhor, reject

and avoid a new dimension or a new sphere or a new expansion or con-

traction (these various words mean the same thing), and strive with all their

might to rebound and regain their old consistency. By contrast, in this

motion of matter bodies seek a new sphere or dimension, and seek it freely,

eagerly and sometimes with the most powerful eﬀort (as in the case of gun-

powder). The instruments of this motion, not the only ones to be sure but

the most powerful or at least the most frequent, are heat and cold. For

example: if air is expanded by tension (as by suction in glass eggs), it makes

great eﬀorts to restore itself. But if heat is applied, it has on the contrary a

positive desire to expand, it covets91 a new sphere, it passes and crosses over

to it freely as into a new form (as people call it); and after some expansion

it no longer cares to return unless provoked to do so by the application of

cold; which is not a return but a second transformation. In the same

manner too, if water is constricted by compression it rebounds, and tries to

be what it was, namely more diﬀuse. But if intense, continual cold sets in,

it changes itself freely and voluntarily into the dense matter of ice; and

if the cold continues without a break, uninterrupted by a warm spell (as

happens in caves and caverns of any depth), it turns to crystal, or a similar

substance, and never reverts.

() Let the ﬁfth motion be the motion of cohesion. We do not mean

simple primary cohesion with another body (that is the motion of bonding),

90 ‘Matter' translates hyle.

91 Reading concupiscit with the second edition (Amsterdam, ) for the concupiscet of the ﬁrst edition

().



The New Organon

but self-cohesion in a single body. It is quite certain that bodies abhor the

dissolution of their cohesion, some more, some less, but all to some degree.

In hard bodies (like steel or glass) the resistance to dissolution is very strong

and vigorous, but also in liquids, where this motion seems to be lacking or

at least very weak, still it is not found to be completely absent, but is clearly

in them in a very low degree, and reveals itself in many experiences, for

instance in bubbles, in the roundness of drops, in ﬁne threads of water

running from a roof, in the stickiness of viscous bodies, and so on. This

tendency shows itself best if one attempts to break something up too small.

For the pestle can do no more in a mortar after the substance has been

crushed to a certain point; water does not get into the ﬁnest cracks; and

even air, despite the subtlety of its own body, does not instantly pass

through the pores of reasonably solid containers, but only by long seepage.

() Let the sixth motion be what we call the motion for gain, or the

motion of want. This is the motion by which, when bodies are involved

with things which are completely diﬀerent in kind from themselves and

almost hostile to them, if they get the chance and the opportunity to avoid

those unsympathetic bodies and to attach themselves to more congenial

things (even though these congenial things have no close agreement with

themselves), still they instantly embrace them, and prefer them as better.

They seem to regard it as a gain (and hence the word we have chosen) as if

they were in want of such bodies. For example: gold leaf, like other metals

in leaf form, does not enjoy being surrounded by air. Hence if it can get

hold of a thick, tangible body (ﬁnger, paper, whatever), it instantly attaches

to it, and is not easily got oﬀ. Also paper or cloth and things of that kind are

not happy with air entering them and mingling in their pores. And there-

fore they gladly soak up water or liquid, and exclude the air. Also lumps

of sugar or sponges soaked in water or wine gradually and by degrees

draw the water or wine up, even if they stick out a long way above the

surface.

Hence we get the best rule for opening and dissolving bodies. Apart from

corrosives and acids, which have their own ways of opening, if an appro-

priate body can be found which is more agreeable and akin to some solid

body than the one with which it is forcibly united, the body instantly opens

up and relaxes, and takes it into itself, rejecting and excluding the other.

This motion for gain does not operate or have eﬀect only on contact. For the

electrical operation (on which Gilbert and others after him have spread

such stories) is simply the appetite of a body excited by a light friction,



Book II

which does not tolerate air and prefers whatever other tangible body it can

ﬁnd close by.

() Let the seventh motion be the motion of major aggregation (as we call

it), by which a body is drawn towards a mass of bodies of similar nature: heavy

substances to the globe of the earth, light things to the circuit of the sky. The

School has marked this with the name of natural motion, for the trivial

reason, apparently, that there was nothing visible from the outside to start

that motion (and so it must, they thought, be innate and inborn in the things

themselves); or perhaps because it never stops. And no wonder: because

heaven and earth are always there; whereas by contrast the causes and

origins of most of the other motions are sometimes present and sometimes

absent. And therefore the School deﬁned this motion as native and perpetual,

and the rest as artiﬁcial, because it is not intermittent but instantly starts as

soon as the others pause. But in truth this motion is quite weak and feeble,

since (except where there is a large mass of a body) it gives way and succumbs

to the other motions. And though this motion has so ﬁlled men's thoughts

that it has thrown other motions into the shadow, still there is little that men

know of it, but they are involved in many errors about it.

() Let the eighth motion be the motion of minor aggregation, by which

the homogeneous parts in a body separate from heterogeneous parts and

coalesce among themselves; by which also whole bodies join and embrace

each other because their substance is similar, and sometimes drift together

from a distance, are attracted and unite: as when cream gradually comes to

the top of the milk, and the lees and dregs of wine sink to the bottom. These

things are not caused so much by weight or lightness, so that some parts

make for the top, while others tend to the bottom, but much more through

the desire of homogeneous things to come together and combine with each

other. This motion diﬀers from the motion of want in two ways. One, that

in the motion of want the major stimulus is that of an evil, contrary nature,

but in this motion (provided there are no obstacles and bonds) the parts

unite through friendship, even though there is no foreign nature to cause

conﬂict; secondly, that the union is closer and more a matter of choice. For

in the motion of want, bodies which are not closely related combine, merely

avoiding foreign bodies, whereas in this motion there is a union of bodies

which are bound by a fully kindred likeness, and are fused into one. This

motion takes place in all compound bodies and would be easy to observe in

each one if it were not bound and bridled by the other tendencies and

necessities of bodies which disturb the union.



The New Organon

This motion is inhibited usually in three ways: by the sluggishness of

bodies, by the constraint of a dominant body and by an external motion. As

for sluggishness: it is certain that there is in tangible bodies a kind of sloth

to a greater or lesser degree, and an aversion to spatial motion, so that

unless stimulated, they would be content with their own state (whatever it

may be) rather than go to the trouble to get into a better state. This kind

of sluggishness is thrown oﬀ in three diﬀerent ways: by heat, or by the

superior power of a related body, or by a lively and powerful motion. And

ﬁrst for the assistance of heat: this is the reason why heat has been said to

be what separates heterogeneous things and unites homogeneous things. Gilbert

has rightly rejected this deﬁnition of the Peripatetics92 with contempt. It is

as if, he says, one were to claim and deﬁne man as a thing that sows wheat

and plants vines; for it is a deﬁnition merely by eﬀects, and particular

eﬀects at that. But the deﬁnition is yet more vulnerable, because those

eﬀects (whatever they may be) do not come from the property of heat

except accidentally (for cold has the same eﬀect, as we shall argue later);

they come from the desire of homogeneous parts to combine, where heat

merely helps to shake oﬀ the sluggishness, which was what had previously

checked the desire. As for the help of a power oﬀered by a related substance:

there is a wonderful illustration of this in the armed magnet, which excites

in iron the virtue of retaining iron because their substance is similar; the

sluggishness of the iron is shaken oﬀ by the power of the magnet. As for the

assistance of motion, this is best seen in wooden arrows which also have

wooden tips; after the swift motion has shaken oﬀ the sluggishness of wood,

they penetrate more deeply into other pieces of wood than if they had been

armed with iron because the substance is the same. We also discussed these

two experiments in the aphorism on concealed instances.93

The constraint on the motion of minor aggregation which is caused by

restraint from a dominant substance is seen in the dissolution of blood and

urine by cold. As long as those substances are ﬁlled by an active spirit,

which is master of the whole and regulates and restrains their individual

parts of every kind, for so long the diﬀerent parts do not coalesce, because

they have this check on them. But when the spirit has evaporated, or has

been suﬀocated by the cold, then the parts are released from restraint and

follow their natural desire to combine. This is why all bodies which

contain a sharp spirit (like salts, and things of that kind) are not dissolved

92 Aristotle and his school.

93 ..



Book II

but endure, because of the permanent and durable restraint of the

dominant and ruling spirit.

But constraint on the motion of minor aggregation caused by an external

motion is best seen in the disturbance of bodies which prevents putrefac-

tion. For all putrefaction is based on a combination of homogeneous parts;

as a result of which the former nature (as they call it) is gradually corrupted

and a new one generated. For the putrefaction which paves the way to the

generation of new forms is generally preceded by the dissolution of the

old forms, and is itself a combination to create homogeneity. If it is

not impeded, a simple dissolution takes place; if obstructions of various

kinds occur, putrefactions follow which are the beginnings of a new

generation. However, if there is frequent disturbance from an external

movement (which is our present concern), then the motion of combination

(which is delicate and sensitive and needs protection from external move-

ments) is disturbed and ceases. We see this happen in innumerable cases:

as when daily stirring or discharge of water prevents putrefaction; winds

prevent air pestilence; grain in granaries remains pure if it is turned and

stirred; in fact, anything that is disturbed from outside does not easily rot

inside.

It remains to deal with the combination of the parts of bodies which is

the chief cause of hardening and drying out. For in a porous body (wood,

bone, parchment etc.), after the spirit or the moisture which has turned

into spirit has evaporated, then the denser parts contract and combine with

greater force, and the result is hardening and drying out. This happens, we

think, not so much by a motion of bonding to avoid a vacuum as by a

motion of friendship and union.

As for combination at a distance, it is uncommon and rare, but occurs in

more cases than is recognised. Here are some likenesses of it: when one

bubble dissolves another; when medicines draw out humours because their

substance is similar; when a string in one stringed instrument causes a

string in another to make the same sound, and so on. We also think that this

motion is vigorous in animal spirits, though this goes completely unrecog-

nised. It is certainly evident in the magnet and in magnetised iron. However,

when we speak of magnetic movements, we have to make a sharp distinc-

tion. For there are four powers or operations in a magnet, which should not

be confused but kept distinct; though men's wonder and bewilderment

have mixed them up. One is the union of magnet with magnet, or of iron

with magnet, or of magnetised iron with iron. The second is its north–



The New Organon

south polarity and deviation from that. The third is its penetration through

gold, glass, stone, everything. The fourth is the communication of power

from the stone to iron and from iron to iron without communication of

substance. Here we are speaking only of its ﬁrst power, that of combina-

tion. Remarkable too is the combining motion of quicksilver and gold; so

that gold attracts quicksilver, even when made up into ointments; and men

who work among quicksilver vapours have a habit of holding a piece of gold

in their mouths to collect the emissions from the quicksilver, which would

otherwise attack their heads and bones; whence too the piece of gold soon

turns white. So much for the motion of minor aggregation.

() Let the ninth motion be the magnetic motion; it is in general a motion

of minor aggregation, but if it operates at great distances and on great masses

of things, it deserves a separate investigation, especially if it does not start

from contact as most motions do, nor continue the action till contact

occurs, as all aggregating movements do, but only lifts bodies or makes

them swell, and nothing further. For if the moon raises the waters, or makes

moist things swell or expand; if the heaven of stars draws the planets

towards their apogees; or the sun keeps the stars of Venus and Mercury at

a certain distance from its body and no further, it does not seem appropriate

to list these motions as major or minor aggregations. They seem to be

intermediate and imperfect forms of aggregation, and should therefore

form their own kind.

() Let the tenth motion be the motion of avoidance, a motion that is

contrary to the motion of minor aggregation. In the motion of avoidance

bodies ﬂee out of antipathy and scatter hostile bodies, and separate them-

selves from them, and refuse to mingle with them. This motion may seem

in some ways to be only a motion accidentally and consequentially, para-

sitic on the motion of minor aggregation, because homogeneous things

cannot coalesce without excluding and getting rid of heterogeneous things.

But it must be classiﬁed as a motion in itself and made a species, because in

many things the desire for avoidance is seen to override the appetite for

combination.

This desire is remarkably prominent in the case of animals' excretions,

and no less so in objects oﬀensive to some of the senses, especially smell and

taste. For a fetid odour is so ﬁercely rejected by the sense of smell that it

even induces, by agreement, a motion of expulsion in the mouth of the

stomach; and a nasty, bitter taste is so ﬁercely rejected by the palate or the

throat that by agreement it causes a shaking of the head and a shiver. This



Book II

motion also takes place in other things. It is observed in some oppositions,94

as in the middle region of the air, whose cold seems to be an exclusion of

the nature of cold from the conﬁnes of the heavenly bodies; just as those

great burning heats and ﬁres that are found in subterranean regions are

exclusions of the nature of heat from the interior of the earth. For heat and

cold, in small quantities, mutually exterminate each other; but if they occur

in larger masses, in full force so to speak, then indeed they struggle to

exclude and eject each other from places. They also say that cinnamon and

sweet-smelling things retain their smell longer when placed next to latrines

and malodorous spots, because they refuse to come out and mix with the

ﬁlthy odours. Certainly quicksilver is prevented from returning to its

whole form, as it would otherwise do, by human saliva, or axle-grease,95 or

turpentine, and suchlike, which prevent its parts from uniting because of

their lack of agreement with bodies of this kind. When surrounded by

them, they withdraw; and thus their avoidance of the intervening sub-

stances is stronger than their desire to unite with the parts that are like

them; this is what they call the mortiﬁcation of quicksilver. The fact that

oil does not mix with water is not only because of the diﬀerence of weight,

but also because there is little agreement between them; as may be seen

from spirit of wine, which is lighter than oil but mixes well with water.

Most remarkable of all is the motion of avoidance in nitre, and such crude

bodies, which have a horror of ﬁre; as in gunpowder, quicksilver and also

gold. However, iron's avoidance of one pole of the magnet is well remarked

by Gilbert not to be avoidance in the proper sense, but conformity and

acceptance of a more suitable position.

() Let the eleventh motion be the motion of assimilation, or of self-

multiplication, or simple generation. By simple generation we do not mean the

generation of whole bodies, as in plants and animals, but of similar bodies.

By this motion similar bodies change other bodies which are akin to them,

or at least sympathetic and prepared, into their own substance and nature:

like ﬂame, which multiplies on vapours and oily substances, and generates

new ﬂame; air, which multiplies over water and watery substances, and

generates new air; vegetable and animal spirit, which multiplies over

the more delicate parts of both watery and oily substances in food, and

generates new spirit; the solid parts of plants and animals, like leaves,

ﬂowers, ﬂesh, bone and so on, each of which assimilates and generates new

94 antiperistasis; cf. . () and ..

The New Organon

substance every day from the juices of their food. No one should be pleased

to share Paracelsus' wild talk; he was clearly fuddled by his own distillations

when he attempted to maintain that nutrition occurs only by separation;

and that the eye, the nose, the brain and the liver are latent in bread, and

roots, leaves and ﬂowers in the moisture of the earth. For just as a crafts-

man brings out from a crude block of stone or wood leaf, ﬂower, eye, nose,

hand, foot and so on by separating oﬀ and rejecting what he does not need,

so, he claims, Archaeus, the Craftsman within bodies, brings out individual

limbs and parts by separation and rejection. But joking apart, it is quite

certain that the individual parts, both similar and organic, in vegetables and

animals, ﬁrst take in, with some selection, the juices of their foods in

almost the same form as each other or with very little diﬀerence, and then

each assimilates them and turns them into its own nature. Nor does this

assimilation or simple generation occur only in animate bodies, but inanimate

bodies also share this process, as has been said of ﬂame and air. Moreover,

the non-living spirit, which is contained in every tangible, animate body, is

constantly active to digest the heavier parts and turn them into spirit,

which would then escape, and that results in loss of weight and drying

out, as we have said elsewhere. And in assimilation we should also include

accretion, which is usually distinguished from nourishment; as when the

mud between stones hardens, and turns into a stony material; scale around

teeth turns into a substance no less hard than the teeth themselves, etc. For

we are of the opinion that there is in all bodies a desire of assimilation, no

less than of uniting with homogeneous substances; but this power is

constrained, just as the other is, though not in the same ways. We should

investigate those ways with all diligence, as well as their dissolution,

because they are relevant to the reinvigoration of old age. Finally, it seems

to deserve remark that in the other nine motions of which we have

spoken,96 bodies seem only to desire the conservation of their own nature;

but in this tenth one their reproduction.

() Let the twelfth motion be the motion of stimulation; this motion

seems to be of the same kind as assimilation, and we sometimes give it that

name without distinction. It is a motion which is diﬀusive, communicative,

transitive and multiplying, as that is; and they are the same (for the most

part) in their eﬀect, though diﬀerent in manner of producing it and in their

subject. For the movement of assimilation proceeds as if with power and

96 There are nine motions if the ﬁrst ‘motion' ‘common to all matter' is excluded.



Book II

authority; it commands and compels the assimilated substance to turn and

change into the substance which assimilates it. But the motion of stimula-

tion proceeds as by art and insinuation, and with stealth; and merely

attracts and adapts the aroused substance to the nature of the substance

which arouses it. Also the motion of assimilation multiplies and utterly

transforms bodies and substances; so there is more ﬂame produced, more

air, more spirit, more ﬂesh. But in the motion of stimulation only the virtues

multiply and pass; and there is more heat produced, more magnetism,

more putrefaction. This motion is particularly prominent in heat and cold.

For heat does not communicate itself in the process of heating by sharing

its primary heat, but only by stimulating the parts of the body to that

motion which is the Form of Heat; of which we spoke in the ﬁrst harvest of

the nature of heat. And therefore heat is excited in stone or metal much

more slowly and with greater diﬃculty than in air, because these bodies are

not adapted and susceptible to that motion. Hence it is likely that there may

be inside towards the bowels of the earth materials which altogether refuse

to be heated; because on account of their great density they are destitute of

the spirit by which that motion is stimulated. Similarly, a magnet imbues

iron with a new arrangement of its parts and with a conforming motion,

but loses none of its own power. Similarly, leaven, yeast, rennet and some

poisons stimulate and excite a successive and continuous motion in a mass

of dough, beer, cheese, or in the human body; not so much because of the

power of the stimulating body as from the readiness and easy compliance

of the body stimulated.

() Let the thirteenth motion be the motion of impression: this motion

too is a kind of assimilation, and is the most subtle of the diﬀusive motions.

We have decided to make it a distinct species because of its marked

diﬀerence from the other two. The simple motion of assimilation trans-

forms the actual bodies; so that if you remove the source of the motion, it

makes no diﬀerence to what follows. For neither the ﬁrst bursting into

ﬂame or the ﬁrst turning into air has any eﬀect on the ﬂame or air that is

subsequently generated. Similarly, the motion of stimulation lasts in its full

form for a very long time after the source of the motion is taken away; as in

a heated body when the source of heat is removed, in aroused iron when

the magnet is taken away; and in a mass of dough when the leaven is

removed. But though the motion of impression is diﬀusive and transitive, it

still seems to depend for ever on the source of its motion; so that if it is

taken away or ceases, the motion instantly fails and dies; and therefore it



The New Organon

has its eﬀect in a moment even, or at least in a very short time. And so we

have chosen to call the motions of assimilation and stimulation, motions of

the generation of Jupiter, because the generation persists; and the latter the

motion of the generation of Saturn, because no sooner is it born than it is

devoured and swallowed. This motion shows itself in three things: in rays

of light, in the striking of sounds and in magnetism so far as its communi-

cation is concerned. For as soon as light is taken away, colours and its other

images perish; and sound dies very soon after the original stroke and the

bodily vibration it causes are ﬁnished. For although sounds are buﬀeted in

their ﬂight by the winds as though by waves, still one must carefully note

that a sound does not last as long as its reverberation does. For when a bell

is struck, the sound seems to continue for a good long time: hence one

easily falls into the error of thinking that the sound as it were stays ﬂoating

in the air all that time; which is absolutely false. For the reverberation is not

numerically the same sound but is a repetition. This is made clear by

suppressing or stopping the body which was struck. For if the bell stops

and is held ﬁrmly and doesn't move, the sound immediately stops, and it

does not reverberate any more; and if after plucking a string, you touch it

again (with a ﬁnger in the case of a lute, with a jack in the case of a spinnet),

the resonation immediately stops. And if you take away a magnet, the iron

instantly falls. But the moon cannot be taken away from the sea, nor the

earth from a heavy weight falling. Thus there can be no experiments with

them; but it is the same principle.

() Let the fourteenth motion be the motion of conﬁguration or position,

by which bodies seem to desire not combination or separation, but position,

and situation and conﬁguration with others. This motion is very obscure,

and not well investigated. In some things it seems to be without a cause,

though in truth (we think) it is not. For if it is asked why the heaven

revolves from east to west rather than from west to east; or why it turns on

poles near the Bears rather than on Orion, or some other part of the sky:

the question seems to be quite out of order, since those things should be

accepted on the basis of experience and as brute facts. And indeed there

surely are some things in nature which are ultimate and uncausable; how-

ever, this does not seem to be one of them. For we think that the reason for

it is a certain harmony and agreement in the universe which has still not

yet come under observation. The same questions remain if we accepted

that the motion of the earth is from west to east. For it too moves about

some poles. And why in the end should those poles be set where they are



Book II

rather than anywhere else? Likewise, the polarity, direction and deviation

of the compass are attributed to this motion. There are also found in

both natural and artiﬁcial bodies, especially if they are solid and not ﬂuid,

a certain collocation and positioning of parts and what we might call hairs

and ﬁbres which need to be carefully investigated, since if we do not ﬁnd

out about them, those bodies cannot be properly discussed or controlled.

The motion of liberty however is the right place to include those currents

in liquids by which, under pressure, they relieve one another in order to

distribute the burden equally, until they can free themselves.

() Let the ﬁfteenth motion be the motion of passage, or the motion

according to the pathways, by which the powers of bodies are more or less

impeded or promoted by the media they are in, in accordance with the

nature of the bodies and their active powers, as well as of the medium. For

one medium is suited to light, another to sound, another to heat and cold,

another to magnetic powers, and others to other powers.

() Let the sixteenth motion be the royal (as we call it) or political motion,

by which the dominant and governing parts of a body restrain the other

parts, tame, subdue, regulate and compel them to unite, separate, stand,

move and take their places in relation to each other, not by their own desires,

but with a view to, and in the interests of, the wellbeing of the governing

part; so that there is a kind of government and polity which the ruling part

exercises over the subject parts. This motion is most prominent in animal

spirit, which tempers all the motions of the other parts so long as it has its

strength. It is found also in a lesser degree in other bodies; as has been said

of blood and urine which are not dissolved until the spirit which mixed and

held their parts together has been expelled or stiﬂed. Nor is this motion

simply conﬁned to spirits, though in most bodies spirits dominate because

of their swift motion and penetration. However, in dense bodies which are

not ﬁlled with a strong and lively spirit (such as is found in quicksilver and

vitriol), the thicker parts are dominant, so that there is no hope of any new

transformation of such bodies unless this curb or yoke is struck oﬀ by some

art. No one should imagine that we have forgotten the subject under

discussion on the ground that (since the sole purpose of this descriptive

catalogue of motions is a better investigation, through instances of struggle,

of their dominance) we are now including dominance among the motions

themselves. For in the description of the royal motion, we are not treating of

the dominance of motions or powers, but of the dominance of parts in bodies.

This is the dominance which forms this particular species of motion.



The New Organon

() Let the seventeenth motion be the spontaneous motion of rotation, by

which bodies which rejoice in motion and are in a good position take

pleasure in their own natures; they pursue only themselves, not other

bodies, and try to embrace themselves. Such bodies seem either to move

without an end; or to be utterly still; or to move towards an end where,

according to their nature, they either rotate or stand still. Bodies in good

position which rejoice in motion move in a circle, i.e. in an eternal and

inﬁnite motion. Bodies in good position which hate motion, simply rest.

Bodies which are not in good position move in a straight line (as the shortest

path) to the company of bodies of the same nature. The motion of rotation

has nine diﬀerent elements. First, the centre, around which the bodies

move; second the poles, upon which they move; third, their circumference

or orbit, according to their distance from the centre; fourth, their speed, as

they move more swiftly or more slowly; ﬁfth, the direction of their motion,

as from east to west or west to east; sixth, their variance from the perfect

circle, in spirals which are more or less distant from their centre; seventh,

their variance from the perfect circle, in spirals which are more or less

distant from their poles; eighth, the shorter or longer distance of their

spirals from each other; ninth and last, the variation of the poles them-

selves, if they are movable; this last has nothing to do with rotation unless

it is circular. By a common and ancient belief, this motion is held to be the

proper motion of the heavenly bodies. But there is a serious dispute about

this motion among some moderns as well as some ancients, who have

attributed rotation to the earth. But there is another controversy, which is

perhaps much more reasonable (if it is not altogether beyond controversy),

as to whether (granted that the earth stands still) this motion is conﬁned to

the territory of heaven, or whether it comes down and is imparted to the

air and the waters. The motion of rotation in missiles, however, and in

spears, arrows, bullets and so on, we attribute wholly to the motion of

liberty.

() Let the eighteenth motion be the motion of trembling. We do not

give much credence to this motion, in the astronomers' version of it. But

it does come in useful when we make a comprehensive investigation of the

appetites of natural bodies; and it seems we should make it a species. It is

like a motion of eternal captivity, so to speak. That is, when bodies are not

in the position that best suits their nature, and yet are not in a desperate

situation, they tremble perpetually, and live in restlessness, neither content

with their place, nor daring to go forward. Such a motion is found in the



Book II

heart and pulse of animals; and it must exist in all bodies which live thus in

an uncertain state between good and bad; under stress they try to free

themselves, but then accept defeat, and then renew the attempt again and

again.

() Let the nineteenth and ﬁnal motion be the motion to which the

name of motion scarcely applies, and yet it really is a motion. We may call

it the motion of rest or the motion of horror of motion. By this motion the earth

stands in its own mass, while its extremes move towards the centre; not

towards an imaginary centre, but towards union. This is also the appetite

by which all highly condensed bodies reject motion; their only appetite

is not to move; and though they may be irritated and provoked to move

in inﬁnite diﬀerent ways, they still preserve their nature (so far as they

can). And if they are forced to move, they seem to do so simply in order

to recover their rest and their position, and not to move again. In this

process they show themselves ﬂexible, and they make quite speedy and

rapid exertions (as if they were thoroughly fed up, and impatient of

any delay). We can only get a partial view of this appetite, because here on

earth tangible things are not condensed to the highest degree and are also

mixed with some spirit through the warming inﬂuence of the heavenly

bodies.

And now we have laid out the principles or simple elements of the

motions, appetites and active powers which are most widespread in nature.

And a good deal of natural science has been outlined in them. We do not

claim that no other species could be added; and the divisions themselves

might be modiﬁed to suit the true lines of things better, and might be

reduced to a smaller number. But we do not mean that this is a merely

abstract division: as if one were to say that bodies desire their own preser-

vation or growth or reproduction or the enjoyment of their own natures;

or that the motions of things tend to preservation and the good, either of

the whole, like indestructibility and bonding; or of the great units, like the

motion of major aggregation, rotation and horror of motion; or of particular

forms, like the others. For though these things are true, still unless their

matter and structure are deﬁned along true lines, they are speculative, and

not much use. However, for the time being they will be adequate, and very

useful for weighing dominances of powers, and for investigating instances of

struggle; which is our present subject.

For some of the motions which we have proposed are completely

invincible; some are stronger than others and can bind, bridle and control



The New Organon

them; some project further than others; some surpass others in time and

speed; some nourish others and strengthen, swell and quicken them.

The motion of indestructibility is utterly adamantine and invincible. We

are still uncertain whether the motion of bonding is invincible. And we have

not stated for certain that there is a vacuum, whether in empty space or

mingled with matter. But we are certain that the reason why the vacuum

was introduced by Leucippus and Democritus (namely because without it

the same bodies could not enclose and ﬁll spaces of varying size) is false.

For matter is like a coil which winds and folds through space, within ﬁxed

limits, without the intervention of a vacuum; and there is not two thousand

times more vacuum in air than there is in gold (as there would have to be).

This is clear enough to us from the powerful virtues of pneumatic bodies

(which otherwise would swim in a vacuum like tiny specks of dust), and

from many other demonstrations. The other motions rule and are ruled in

turn, in proportion to their vigour, quantity, speed and projection, as well

as to the assistance or resistance which they meet.

For example: an armed magnet holds and suspends iron sixty times its

own weight; so much does the motion of minor aggregation prevail over the

motion of major aggregation; but if the weight is more than that, it gives way.

A lever of a certain strength will raise so much weight; to that point the

motion of liberty prevails over the motion of major aggregation; but if the

weight is greater, it gives way. Leather stretched to a certain point does

not break; to that point the motion of cohesion prevails over the motion of

tension; but if the tension be greater, the leather breaks, and the motion

of cohesion gives way. Water runs out through a crack of a certain size;

to that point the motion of major aggregation prevails over the motion of

cohesion; but if the crack is too small, it gives way, and the motion of

cohesion prevails. If you put simple sulphur powder into a gun with a ball,

and apply ﬁre, the ball is not ﬁred; in this case the motion of major

aggregation overcomes the motion of matter. But if you put gunpowder in,

the motion of matter in the sulphur prevails, assisted by the motions of

matter and avoidance in the nitre. And so with the rest. For instances of

struggle (which indicate the dominance of powers, and in what amounts and

proportions they dominate or give way) are to be sought with keen and

constant diligence everywhere.

We also need to make a vigorous investigation of the ways and reasons

why motions give way. Do they for example totally cease, or do they

struggle to a certain point and then are held in check? For in bodies here



Book II

on earth there is no true rest, either in wholes or in parts, but only the

appearance of it. This apparent rest is caused either by equilibrium or by the

absolute dominance of motions. By equilibrium in the case of scales, which

stand at rest if the weights are equal. By dominance in the case of perforated

pots,97 where the water stays in place and is prevented from falling by the

dominance of the motion of bonding. However, one should note (as I have

said) how far the yielding motions struggle. If a man is pinned down in a

ﬁght, stretched out on the ground with arms and legs tied, or otherwise

restrained; and yet tries with all his strength to get up, his struggle is no

less though he does not succeed. The true situation here (i.e. whether the

yielding motion is annihilated by the dominance or whether the struggle

continues, though not visible) is hidden in conﬂicts, but will perhaps appear

through comparisons. For example: do an experiment with guns to see

whether a gun, over the distance that it shoots a ball in a straight line or

(as they say) at point-blank range,98 strikes with less force when shot

upward, where the motion of the blow is simple, than it does when shot

downwards, where the motion of gravity adds to the force of the blow.

We should also collect the rules of dominance which we ﬁnd: for example

that the commoner the good sought, the stronger the motion. Thus the

motion of bonding involved in the union of the universe is stronger than the

motion of gravity involved in the union of dense bodies. Another example

is that the appetites which are private goods do not generally prevail against

appetites which are more for the public good, except in small quantities. If

only this were the case in civil aﬀairs!

In the twenty-ﬁfth place among the privileged instances we shall put sugges-

tive99 instances, i.e. instances which suggest or point to human beneﬁts. For

being able to and knowing extend human nature in themselves, but do not

make it happy. And therefore from the entirety of things we must pick those

which do most for human life. But it will be more appropriate to speak of this

when we discuss practical implications. Moreover in the actual task of inter-

preting individual subjects, we always make room for the human chart, or the

wish list. For both to inquire and to wish appropriately are a part of science.

In the twenty-sixth place among privileged instances we put multipurpose

instances.100 They are instances which are relevant to various topics and

come up quite often, and thus save a lot of work and new proofs. There will

be a better place to speak of instruments themselves and devices when we

discuss applications to practice and methods of experimenting; and those

which are already known and in use will be described in the particular

histories of individual arts. At present we shall make some general remarks

about them simply as examples of multipurposiveness.

Man works on natural bodies (apart from simple application and removal)

in seven particular ways: by exclusion of obstructive or disturbing objects;

by compressing, stretching, shaking and so on; by heat and cold; by keep-

ing a thing in a suitable place; by checking and controlling motion; by

special agreements; or by a timely and appropriate alternation, and by a

series and succession, of some or all of the above.

() For the ﬁrst: much disturbance is caused by the common air which

is all around us and exerting pressure, and by the rays of the heavenly

bodies. Devices that seek to exclude them may properly be called multi-

purpose. This is the function of the material and thickness of the vessels in

which we place bodies ready to be worked on; also perfect methods of

closing vessels, by making them solid and stopping them up with what the

chemists call ‘putty of wisdom'. A very useful thing is a sealant made by

pouring a liquid over a surface, as when they pour oil on wine or herb

juices; it spreads over the top like a cover and keeps it well protected from

the air. Powders are also quite good; though they have some air in them,

they still keep out the force of the open, surrounding air, as when grapes

and fruit are preserved in sand and ﬂour. Wax, too, honey, pitch and such

viscous substances are properly used as covers and make quite a good seal

and keep out air and celestial inﬂuences. We have also sometimes tried the

experiment of placing a vessel and other bodies within quicksilver, which

is by far the densest of all the substances that can be poured around things.

Caves and underground cavities are very useful to prevent exposure to the

sun and the ravages of the open air; the inhabitants of North Germany use

them as granaries. This is also the purpose of keeping things under water;

I remember I heard something about someone letting wineskins down into

100 instantiae polychrestae



Book II

a deep well (to keep them cool), but then forgetting them and leaving them

there, and they stayed there for many years, and when he took them out,

the wine had not gone ﬂat or lifeless but was much ﬁner on the palate

because (apparently) of a more thorough mixture of its own parts. If the

situation requires bodies to be submerged in a depth of water, a river

perhaps or the sea, but not to have contact with the water, and not to be

shut up in sealed vessels but to be just surrounded by air, very useful is the

vessel which is sometimes used to work under the water on sunken ships,

which enables divers to stay under water longer and to take breaths in turn

from time to time. It was like this. A concave metal barrel was constructed,

and was let down evenly into the water, its mouth parallel to the surface; in

this way it carried all the air it contained with it to the bottom of the sea. It

stood on three feet (like a tripod) which were a little shorter than a man, so

that when a diver ran out of breath, he could put his head into the hollow

of the jar, take a breath, and then continue with his work. We have heard

that a device has just been invented like a small ship or boat, which can

carry men under water for a certain distance. Under the kind of jar we

mentioned above, certain bodies could easily be suspended; that is why we

adduced this experiment.

There is another use of a careful, ﬂawless closure of bodies: namely not

merely to prevent the entrance of air from outside (which we have just been

discussing), but also to prevent the escape of the spirit of a body which is

the subject of an operation inside. For anyone working with natural bodies

needs to be certain of his amounts, i.e. be certain that nothing has evaporated

or leaked out. For profound alterations occur in bodies when nature

prevents annihilation and art also prevents loss or evaporation of any part.

On this matter a false belief has become current (and if it were true, there

would be virtually no hope of the conservation of a speciﬁc amount with-

out loss), i.e. that spirits of substances and air which has been thinned by a

high degree of heat cannot be held by any sealant, but seep through the tiny

pores in the vessels. Men have been brought to think this by the common

experiment of the glass inverted over water with a candle or burning paper

inside, as a result of which the water is drawn upwards; and similarly by the

experiment of cupping-glasses, which draw up the ﬂesh when warmed over

a ﬂame. They think that in both experiments the thinned air is expelled and

hence the quantity of it is decreased, and therefore the water or the ﬂesh

follows by bonding. But this is very wrong. For the air is not diminished in

quantity, but contracted in space; and the consequent movement of the



The New Organon

water or ﬂesh only begins with the extinction of the ﬂame or the cooling

of the air; so that doctors place sponges soaked in cold water101 on the

cupping-glasses. And therefore there is no reason to be much afraid of

an easy escape of air or spirits. For though it is true that even the solidest

bodies have their pores, still air or spirit scarcely allows itself to be thinned

so ﬁne, just as water refuses to escape through a tiny chink.

() Of the second of the seven methods listed, note especially that com-

pressions and such violent forces certainly have the strength to cause

motion in space in the most powerful fashion, as in machines and missiles;

even to the point of destroying organic body and the virtues which consist

wholly in motion. For compressions destroy every kind of life and even

every ﬂame and ﬁre, and damage and disable every kind of machine. They

also have the power to destroy virtues which consist in arrangement and in

a crude diﬀerence between elements, as in colours (a bruised ﬂower does

not have the same colour as an intact ﬂower, nor crushed amber as whole

amber), and in tastes (an unripe pear does not have the same taste as a pear

which has been squeezed and worked in the hand, which makes it noticeably

sweeter). But these violent forces do not have much eﬀect on the more

notable transformations and alterations of similar bodies; because they do

not cause bodies to acquire a new solidity that is stable and quiescent but

a temporary solidity that is always tending to get free and return to its

original form. However, it would not be unproﬁtable to make some careful

experiments in this line, to see whether the condensation or rarefaction of

a similar body (such as air, water, oil and so on) when similarly eﬀected by

force, could be made stable and ﬁxed, and almost changed in nature. This

should ﬁrst be veriﬁed simply by giving it time, and then by the use of

instruments and agreements. This would have been easy to do (if I had only

thought of it) when I compressed water by hammer and press (as I reported

elsewhere),102 before it burst out. I should have left the ﬂattened sphere for

a few days before I let out the water, to ﬁnd out by experiment whether it

would immediately ﬁll the same volume as it had before condensation. If it

did not do so, either immediately or shortly after, the condensation could

have been clearly seen to be stable; if it did, it would have been apparent

that restoration had occurred, and the compression had been temporary. A

similar thing should have been done with the air in the glass eggs.103 I

101 Reading frigida for frigidas, following Fowler.

103 Cf. ..



Book II

should have put a ﬁrm seal on them immediately after the strong suction;

then the eggs should have stayed sealed for some days; and only after that

should I have tried to see whether air was drawn through the open hole with

a hiss, or whether the same quantity of water would have been drawn in on

immersion as there would have been in the beginning if there had been no

waiting period. This is probable, or at least worth testing, whether it could

and can happen, given that a period of time has similar eﬀects in bodies

which are rather more dissimilar. A stick bent by compression fails after a

certain time to spring back; this should not be attributed to any loss in the

quantity of wood in that time, for the same will happen to a strip of steel

(after a longer period), which does not evaporate. But if the experiment

does not succeed through simple passage of time, do not abandon the

project, but try using some aids. For it is of considerable use if ﬁxed, stable

natures can be imposed on bodies by violent forces. In this way air could

be changed into water by condensation, and many other such things could

be done. For man is more the master of forceful movements than of the

others.

() The third of the seven methods relates to that great instrument of

the operations of nature and of art, that is heat and cold. In this subject

human power is plainly lame in one foot. We have the heat of ﬁre, which is

inﬁnitely more powerful and more intense than the heat of the sun (as it

reaches us) and the heat of animals. But we lack cold, except what can be

had in winter or in caves or by packing things in snow and ice, which by

comparison can perhaps be equated with the heat of the midday sun in

some southern region in the torrid zone when it is intensiﬁed by beating

oﬀ mountains and walls; such heat and cold can be borne by animals at

least for a short time. But they are as nothing compared with the heat of a

blazing furnace, or the corresponding degree of cold. Therefore all things

here among us tend to rarefaction, drying and exhaustion, almost nothing

to condensation and thickening except by means of mixtures and artiﬁcial

methods. And so we must use all diligence to gather instances of cold: such

as seem to occur in the exposure of bodies on towers in the bitter cold; in

caverns beneath the earth; in packing with ice and snow in deep places dug

out for this purpose; in lowering bodies into wells; in covering them in

quicksilver and metals; in immersing them in liquids which turn wood into

stone; in burying them in the earth (which is said to be the way the Chinese

make porcelain, where masses of material suitable for this purpose are said

to remain under the earth for forty or ﬁfty years, and to be bequeathed to



The New Organon

heirs, like a kind of artiﬁcial mineral); and so on. We should also investigate

the condensations which occur in nature which are caused by cold, so that

when we have learned their causes, we may apply them to arts: such as we

see in the sweating of marble and stones; in the condensation on glass on

the inside of windows towards dawn after the cold of the night; in the

origin and gathering of mists into subterranean waters, which bubble up as

springs; and anything else of this kind.

There are other things that have a cold eﬀect besides things that are cold

to the touch; these too have a condensing eﬀect, but seem to work only on

the bodies of animals, and hardly on anything else. Many medicines and

plasters turn out to be like this. Some condense ﬂesh and tangible parts, for

example astringent medicines and congealing medicines; others condense

spirits, best seen in sleeping pills. There are two ways of condensing

spirits by sleeping pills, or sleep-inducing drugs: one acts by sedation of

movement, the other by expulsion of spirits. Violet, dry rose, lettuce and

gentle and kindly substances work by means of their friendly and gently

cooling vapours to invite the spirits to unite and compose their ﬁerce and

anxious motion. Likewise, rosewater placed under the nostrils in cases of

fainting refreshes spirits which are too slack and languid, and gives them

nourishment. Opiates however and related substances totally expel the

spirits by their malign, hostile quality. Hence if they are applied to an

external part, the spirits immediately leave that part, and do not easily ﬂow

back to it, and if they are taken internally, their vapours rise to the head and

completely scatter the spirits contained in the ventricles of the brain; and

as the spirits retreat and ﬁnd no place to escape to, they unite and condense,

and are sometimes totally extinguished and smothered. However, these

same opiates in moderate doses, by a secondary eﬀect (i.e. the condensation

that follows the union), strengthen the spirits and make them more vigorous,

and repress their useless, inﬂammatory motions, as a result of which they

contribute a good deal to the cure of diseases and the prolongation of life.

We should also deal with the preparation of substances to receive cold:

for example, slightly warm water will freeze more easily than water which

is altogether cold, and so on.

Besides, as nature supplies cold so infrequently, we must do as the

apothecaries do. When some simple cannot be had, they take a substitute

for it, a quid pro quo, as they call it: as wood of aloes for balsam, and cassia

for cinnamon. In a similar way, we must carefully inquire whether there are

any substitutes for cold; i.e. in what ways condensation can be induced in



Book II

substances other than by cold, which causes them as its own proper eﬀect.

There seem to be only four such condensations (so far as is yet clear). The

ﬁrst seems to occur through simple compression, which has little eﬀect on

the constant density (for bodies bounce back), but can still be helpful. The

second occurs through contraction of the denser parts in a body after the

evaporation or escape of the ﬁner parts, as happens when things are

hardened by ﬁre or when metals are repeatedly quenched, and so on. The

third happens by the coition of homogeneous parts, the most solid parts in

any body, which had previously been separated and mingled with less solid

parts: as in the restoration of sublimated mercury, which occupies much

more space in the form of powder than simple mercury, and likewise in all

cleansing of metals from dross. The fourth occurs through agreements, by

application of things which cause condensation by a hidden force of the

body. Such agreements are as yet barely discernible, which is not surpris-

ing since not much is to be expected from an inquiry into agreements until

the discovery of forms and structures makes progress. As far as the bodies

of animals are concerned, there is no doubt that there are several medicines,

taken internally as well as externally, which cause condensation as if by

agreement, as we said above. But in inanimate things this kind of eﬀect is

rare. Admittedly, there has been quite a noise, both in writing and in

rumour, about the story of the tree in one of the islands of the Azores or

Canaries (I do not remember which) which drips perpetually, and so gives

some supply of water to the inhabitants. And Paracelsus says that a herb

called Sun-Dew is ﬁlled with dew at midday when the sun is hot and the

other grasses around it are dry. We think that both stories are fables, though

they would obviously be most remarkably useful, and very well worth

investigation, if they were true. Similarly for the sweet dews, like manna,

which are found on oakleaves in May: we do not believe that they are caused

and condensed by an agreement or property of the oakleaf. Since they also

fall on other leaves, they are evidently held and preserved on oakleaves

because oakleaves are close knit and not porous, as most other leaves are.

As for heat, man clearly has a wonderful supply abundantly available,

and great power over it, but observation and investigation are lacking in

some quite vital matters, however the alchemists may boast. For operations

involving very intense heat are sought and observed; but those giving

gentler heat, which come closest to the ways of nature, are not tried,

and therefore escape notice. Hence we see in those furnaces which are most

valued that the spirits of bodies are highly excited, as in strong waters



The New Organon

and some other chemical oils; tangible parts are hardened, and sometimes

ﬁxed, when the volatile element escapes; homogeneous parts are separated;

heterogeneous bodies too are incorporated wholesale and merged; and

above all the bonds of compound bodies and the subtle structures are

confounded and destroyed. They should have tried operations involving

a gentler ﬁre and investigated them. More subtle mixtures and orderly

structures could be created and derived, on the model of nature and in

imitation of the eﬀects of the sun, of the sort of which we sketched some

examples in the Aphorism on instances of alliance.104 For the operations of

nature are performed with much smaller portions and more precise and

discriminating arrangements than in the operations of ﬁre as now applied.

Man would truly be seen to increase his authority if by heat and artiﬁcial

forces operations of nature could be copied in kind, perfected in power and

varied in number; to which should be added that they could be speeded up.

Rust takes a long time to work on iron, but the eﬀect of sesquioxide appears

instantly; similarly with verdigris and white lead. Crystal takes a long time

to grow to perfection, but glass is blown in a moment. Rocks take years to

form, but bricks are quickly baked, and so on. Therefore (to return to our

point) all the diﬀerent varieties of heat with their respective eﬀects should

be diligently and industriously gathered from every source and investigated:

celestial heat through rays, direct, reﬂected, refracted and concentrated in

burning-glasses; the heat of lightning, ﬂame, coalﬁre; ﬁre of diﬀerent

materials; open ﬁre, closed ﬁre, forced ﬁre, raging ﬁre; ﬁre modiﬁed by

diﬀerent furnace materials; ﬁre excited by blowing, ﬁre simmering and

unstirred; ﬁre at diﬀerent distances; ﬁre making its way through various

media; damp heats, like Mary's baths, dung, the external heat of animals,

the internal heat of animals and hay stored in a close place; dry heats, like

ashes, lime, warm sand; in fact, every kind of heat with their degrees.

Above all we must attempt to investigate and uncover the eﬀects and

operations of the approach and withdrawal of heat by degrees, gradually,

regularly, periodically and at speciﬁc distances and periods of time. This

orderly inequality is truly the daughter of heaven and the mother of

generation; no great eﬀect can be expected from violent, sudden or in-

consistent heat. This is very obvious even in the case of vegetables; in the

wombs of animals too there is great inequality of heat, from the movement,

sleep, eating and passions of the females carrying the foetus; ﬁnally, in the

104 ..



Book II

earth's own wombs, the wombs in which metals and fossils are formed, this

inequality has its place and power. All the more reason to remark the inept-

ness of some alchemists of the reformed school, who have thought to

achieve their ambitions by means of the constant heat of lamps and such

things burning at a steady rate. So much for the operations and eﬀects of

heat. This is not the place for a deeper scrutiny before the forms of things

and the structures of bodies are further investigated, and come into the

light. Once we have ﬁrm knowledge of the exemplars, it will be time to seek,

devise and adapt instruments.

() The fourth mode of operation is through the passage of time, which

is the storekeeper and steward of nature, and in a manner the treasurer. We

call it passage of time when a body is left to itself for a considerable period,

guarded and protected throughout from all external force. For internal

motions reveal and perfect themselves when external and adventitious

motions cease. The works of age are much more subtle than those of ﬁre.

There could not be such a clariﬁcation of wine by ﬁre as there is through

passage of time; and even incinerations made by ﬁre are less thorough than

the dissolution and destruction of the centuries. Instant incorporation and

mixing precipitated by ﬁre is much inferior to that eﬀected by the passage

of time. The variety of diﬀerent structures which bodies try through the

passage of time (e.g. varieties of putrefaction) are destroyed by ﬁre or a

moderately strong heat. It would not therefore be irrelevant to remark that

the motions of bodies which have been closely conﬁned have something of

violence in them. For the imprisonment impedes the body's spontaneous

movements. Therefore the passage of time in an open vessel promotes

separation; in a fully closed vessel mixture, in a more or less closed vessel

which allows a little air, putrefaction. In any case, instances of the works

and eﬀects of the passage of time should be diligently sought from every

quarter.

() Direction of motion (which is the ﬁfth of the modes of operation) also

has great eﬀect. We call it direction of motion when an intervening body

impedes, repels, permits and directs the spontaneous movement of another

body. It usually consists in the shapes and position of vessels. An upright

cone assists the condensation of vapours in alembics; but an inverted cone

helps the reﬁning of sugar in receivers.105 Sometimes bending is required,

and narrowing and widening by turns, and so on. It is also the principle in

105 in vasis resupinatis, ‘receivers' (Ellis)



The New Organon

percolation: an intervening body lets through one element in a substance

and holds back another element of it. Percolation or other direction of

motion is not always done from outside, but can also be done by means of

a body within a body: as when pebbles are put into water to collect the

slime; syrups are clariﬁed with the whites of eggs, so that the thicker parts

stick to it and may afterwards be separated. Telesio even attributed the

shapes of animals to this direction of motion; they were due, he claimed, to

the channels and folds of the womb, a gauche and superﬁcial observation.

He should have been able to notice a similar formation inside the shells of

eggs, where there are no wrinkles or inequality. But it is true that a regula-

tion of motion achieves formation in the case of models and moulds for

casting.106

() Operations by agreements and aversions (which is the sixth mode)

are often hidden in the depth. For those so-called occult and speciﬁc

properties and sympathies and antipathies are to a great extent corruptions

of philosophy. We cannot expect much from discovering the agreements

of things before the discovery of the forms and simple structures. For

agreement is nothing other than a reciprocal symmetry of forms and

structures.

However, the larger and more universal agreements of things are not

wholly obscure. And so we must begin from them. Their ﬁrst and highest

distinction is this: certain bodies are quite diﬀerent from each other in the

abundance and rarity of their matter, but agree in structure; others on the

other hand agree in abundance and rarity of material, but diﬀer in structure.

For it has been well observed by the chemists, in their triad of principles,

that sulphur and mercury pervade virtually everything. (Their reasoning

about salt is inept and introduced in order to include earthly, dry and ﬁxed

bodies.) But in those two at any rate there seems to be visible a kind of

natural agreement of the most universal kind. The agreements of sulphur

are: oil and fatty vapour; ﬂame; and perhaps star substance. In the other case

there is agreement between mercury and water and watery vapours; air;

and perhaps the pure interstellar ether. And yet these twin quaternions,107

or great tribes of things (each within its order), diﬀer immensely in amount

of matter and density, but agree closely in structure, as is apparent in many

things. On the other hand, diﬀerent metals agree well in the their

abundance and density (especially in comparison with vegetables etc.), but

106 in modulis et proplasticis

107 Two sets of four.



Book II

diﬀer in many diﬀerent ways in structure; and similarly diﬀerent vegetable

and animals vary almost inﬁnitely in structure, but are only a few degrees

apart in amount of matter or density.

The next most universal agreement is that of the principal bodies and

their sustenance, i.e. the base substances and their nourishment. And so

one must inquire in what climates, in what terrain and at what depth

individual metals are generated; and similarly of gems, be their origin from

rocks or among minerals; in what kind of soil the diﬀerent trees, bushes and

plants grow best and prosper; together with the enrichments which are

most helpful, whether manure of various kinds or chalk, seasand, ash etc.;

and which of these are most suitable and helpful in which kind of soil. Also

heavily dependent on agreement are the planting and grafting of trees and

plants, and their various methods, i.e. which plants are most successfully

engrafted on which, etc. On this subject it would be a pleasing experiment,

which we heard has been recently tried, to engraft forest trees (up to now

it has usually been done only with garden trees); the result is that the leaves

and nuts are much increased, and the trees give more shade. Similarly, what

animals eat should be noted respectively for each kind, and with their

negatives. For meateaters cannot survive if fed on herbs; and this is also the

reason why (even though the human will has more power over its body than

that of the other animals) the Order of the Feuillans108 almost disappeared

after trying the experiment (as is reported), as if human nature could not

bear it. We should also note the diﬀerent materials of putrefaction, from

which tiny creatures are generated.

The agreements of principal bodies with their subordinates (for the

things we have mentioned may be regarded as such) are quite evident. We

may add the agreements of the senses with their objects. Since these agree-

ments are very obvious and well noted and sharply scrutinised, they may

throw much light on other, hidden agreements.

The interior agreements and aversions of bodies, or friendships and con-

ﬂicts (for I am quite tired of the words ‘sympathies' and ‘antipathies'

because of superstitions and stupidities), are falsely associated, or tainted

with fables, or little known because ignored. For if anyone asserts that there

is conﬂict between the vine and the cabbage because when planted next to

each other they do not do very well, the reason is obvious: both plants are

108 Folitani: apparently the Feuillans, French Cistercian monks at the Abbey of Feuillans, who in 

began to adopt an exceedingly rigorous rule of life, which led to a number of deaths among them

before it was moderated.



The New Organon

aggressive suckers, and rob each other. If anyone asserts that there is agree-

ment and friendship between corn and the cornﬂower or the wild poppy

because these plants grow almost exclusively in cultivated ﬁelds, he ought

rather to say that there is a conﬂict between them, because both poppy and

cornﬂower spring and grow from some juice in the soil which the corn has

left and rejected; hence the sowing of corn prepares the earth for their

growth. There is a great number of such false associations. As for fables,

they should be completely exterminated. There remains a very slender

store of agreements which have been proved by certain experiment, such

as magnet and iron, gold and quicksilver, and so on. Some other note-

worthy cases are found in chemical experiments to do with minerals. The

commonest of them (such a small number anyway) are found in some

medicines, which from their occult and speciﬁc properties (as they call

them) have a relationship with limbs or humours or diseases or sometimes

with individual natures. And we should not omit the agreements between

the motions and phases of the moon and the conditions of lower bodies,

according as they can be gathered and accepted from experiments in

agriculture, navigation and medicine, or from elsewhere with a strict,

honest selection. But universal instances of more hidden agreements, the

more infrequent they are, the more care is needed for the inquiry by means

of reports and faithful and honest narratives, provided this is done with-

out folly or credulity, but with scrupulous and almost sceptical faithfulness.

There remains the agreement of bodies which is not artiﬁcial in its mode

of operation but multipurpose in its application, which we should certainly

not neglect but investigate with careful observation. This is the coition or

union of bodies, which may be easy or diﬃcult, by compounding or by

simple juxtaposition. For some bodies easily and freely mix and incorporate

with each other, but others with diﬃculty and reluctance; for example,

powders are best incorporated with waters; limes and ashes with oils; and

so on. And we should not only collect instances of bodies' tendency or

aversion to being mixed, but also instances of the arrangement of their

parts, and of distribution and digestion after they are mixed, and ﬁnally also

of dominance once the mixing has been completed.

() There remains in the last place the seventh and last of the seven

modes of operation, i.e. operation in which the other six alternate and take

turns. But before we make a deeper inquiry into each one, it would not be

appropriate to give examples. It is a thing diﬃcult in thought yet potent in

practical eﬀects, to elaborate a series or chain of this kind of alternation as



Book II

it applies to individual eﬀects. A supreme impatience possesses and holds

men in this kind of thing, both in inquiry and practice; yet it is the thread

of the labyrinth as far as major results are concerned. But let this suﬃce as

an example of multipurposiveness.

LI

In the twenty-seventh and last place among privileged instances we shall put

magical instances.109 By this name we mean instances in which the matter

or the eﬃcient cause is slight or small in comparison with the eﬀect or

result which follows. So that even if they are common, they are still like a

miracle, some at ﬁrst glance, others even after attentive observation. Nature

supplies these herself sparingly; it will appear in future times what she will

do when her lap is shaken out, after the discovery of forms, processes and

structures. But (so far as we conjecture in our time) these magical eﬀects

happen in three ways. They happen ﬁrst by self-multiplication, as in ﬁre,

and the so-called speciﬁc poisons, and also in movement communicated

and strengthened from one wheel to another. Or they happen by excite-

ment or attraction in another object, as in a magnet which excites a large

number of needles without losing or lessening any of its own virtues, and

in yeast and such things. They happen thirdly by anticipation of a motion,

as noted in the case of gunpowder, cannon and mines. The ﬁrst two means

require an investigation of agreements, the third the measuring of motions.

We have as yet no sound indications whether there is any way of changing

bodies through their smallest parts, or ‘minima' (as they call them),110 and

of transforming the subtler structures of matter (which occurs in every

kind of transformation of matter, so that art may do in a short time what

nature achieves through many windings). And as we aim in what is solid

and true to achieve our ﬁnal and highest goals, so we consistently despise

the vain and presumptuous, and do our best to get rid of it.

So much for privileged instances, or ﬁrst-class instances. I should add the

reminder that in this Organon of ours we are dealing with logic, not

philosophy. But our logic instructs the understanding and trains it, not (as

The New Organon

common logic does) to grope and clutch at abstracts with feeble mental

tendrils, but to dissect nature truly, and to discover the powers and actions

of bodies and their laws limned in matter. Hence this science takes its

origin not only from the nature of the mind but from the nature of things;

and therefore it is no wonder if it is strewn and illustrated throughout with

observations and experiments of nature as samples of our art. The privileged

instances (as is clear from our account) are twenty-seven in number; and are:

solitary instances; instances of transition; revealing instances; concealed

instances; constitutive instances; instances of resemblance; unique instances;

deviant instances; borderline instances; instances of power; instances of associ-

ation and aversion; accessory instances; instances of alliance; crucial instances;

instances of divergence; instances that open doors or gates; summoning instances;

instances of the road; instances of supplement; cleaving instances; instances of

the rod; running instances; doses of nature; instances of struggle; suggestive

instances; multipurpose instances; magical instances. The use of these instances,

in which they surpass ordinary instances, tends in general either in the

direction of information or in the direction of operation, or in both. In the

informative aspect they assist either the senses or the understanding. In the

case of the ﬁve instances of the lamp, for example, they assist the senses.111

They assist the understanding either by speeding the exclusion of a form,

as solitary instances do; or by narrowing and closely delimiting the

aﬃrmation of a form, as do instances of transition, revealing instances and

instances of association, as well as accessory instances; or by raising the under-

standing and guiding it to general and common natures: which they do

either directly, as do concealed and unique instances and instances of alliance;

or in a high degree, as do constitutive instances; or only slightly, as do

instances of resemblance; or by correcting the understanding from its habitual

channels, as do deviant instances; or by guiding it to the great form or struc-

ture of the whole, as do borderline instances; or by warning of false forms

and causes, as do crucial instances and instances of divergence. As for the

practical aspect, privileged instances either designate, measure or facilitate

practice. They designate either by pointing to where we should begin so as

not to repeat what has already been done, as do instances of power; or what

we should aim at if we have the opportunity, as do suggestive instances; the

four mathematical instances measure;112 the facilitating instances are the

multipurpose instances and the magical.

111 The ﬁve types of instance described in .– are introduced in . as ‘instances of the lamp'.

112 The four ‘mathematical instances' are nos. – in .–.

Again, we should make a collection of some of the twenty-seven

instances now at the beginning (as we said above of some of them), and not

wait for a special inquiry into natures. Such are the instance of resemblance,

the unique, the deviant and the borderline instances, the instances of power, the

instances that open doors or gates, the suggestive, the multipurpose and the

magical instances. For these either help or heal the understanding and the

senses, or assist practice in general. The rest should be sought when we

draw up tables of presentation for the purpose of interpreting a particular

nature. For instances endowed and distinguished by these privileges are like

the soul among the ordinary instances of presentation; and as we said at the

beginning, a few of them are as good as many; hence when we make tables,

we should investigate them with great vigour, and put them in tables. We

shall also have to speak of them in what follows, and that is why we had to

put their treatment ﬁrst.

And now we must proceed to the aids and corrections of induction, and

after that to concrete things, and to latent processes and latent structures, and

the other things which we set out in due order in Aphorism . We intend

at the end (like honest and faithful guardians) to hand men their fortunes

when their understanding is freed from tutelage and comes of age, from

which an improvement of the human condition must follow, and greater

power over nature. For by the Fall man declined from the state of innocence

and from his kingdom over the creatures. Both things can be repaired even

in this life to some extent, the former by religion and faith, the latter by the

arts and sciences. For the Curse did not make the creation an utter and

irrevocable outlaw. In virtue of the sentence ‘In the sweat of thy face shalt

thou eat bread',113 man, by manifold labours (and not by disputations,

certainly, or by useless magical ceremonies), compels the creation, in time

and in part, to provide him with bread, that is to serve the purposes of

human life.
