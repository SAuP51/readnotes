The main objective of Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy is to expand the range, variety and quality of texts in the history of philosophy which are available in English. The series includes texts by familiar names (such as Descartes and Kant) and also by less well-known authors. Wherever possible, texts are published in complete and unabridged form, and translations are specially commissioned for the series. Each volume contains a critical introduction together with a guide to further reading and any necessary glossaries and textual apparatus. The volumes are designed for student use at undergraduate and postgraduate level and will be of interest not only to students of philosophy, but also to a wider audience of readers in the history of science, the history of theology and the history of ideas.

For a list of titles published in the series, please see end of book.

## Preface

My thinking about Francis Bacon's philosophical works has been enormously inﬂuenced, and altered in signiﬁcant ways, by the work I have done over the past ﬁve years, leading up to the co-authored biography of Bacon, Hostage to Fortune: The Troubled Life of Francis Bacon (1998). That biography was in every sense a collaboration; both the research and the actual writing were conducted as a vigorous partnership between myself and Dr Alan Stewart of Birkbeck College. Accordingly, I acknowledge with deep gratitude here the important part Alan Stewart's research, wisdom and friendship have played in the production of this piece of work.

## Introduction

Francis Bacon was born in 1561, the ﬁfth and last surviving son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper to Queen Elizabeth I, the second surviving child of his second wife. Left a widower in 1552, with six children under twelve to bring up, Nicholas had rapidly married Anne Cooke, one of ﬁve highly educated daughters of Edward VI's tutor, Sir Anthony Cooke, celebrated, like their father, for their learning and piety. All made extremely advantageous marriages: Margaret to a prominent goldsmith; Elizabeth to Sir Thomas Hoby and then to the son of the earl of Bedford; Katherine to Sir Henry Killigrew. Most signiﬁcantly, Mildred became the second wife of William Cecil, later Queen Elizabeth's Principal Secretary of State. Thus Francis was kin to some of the most powerful and inﬂuential ﬁgures of his time.

This was just as well, since he had to contend, throughout his life, with the fact that his father left him inadequately provided for ﬁnancially. Sir Nicholas was in the process of making suitable long-term purchases of land for Francis and his elder brother Anthony when he died unexpectedly in 1579. Had that settlement been complete, Bacon later claimed, he would have been able to devote his entire life to study, and his grand plan for an entirely new system of learning might have reached completion in his lifetime. As it was, he was obliged to pursue a civil career, practising law at Gray's Inn in London from the 1580s. Around 1590 Francis and Anthony sought to ballast their ﬁnancial prospects by entering the service of the earl of Essex as scholarly secretaries and collectors of intelligence.

Given his volatile relationship with the queen, Essex was a poor choice of backer, and in the aftermath of the Essex rebellion (following which Essex was beheaded), Francis was lucky to survive politically. But then, Bacon was never a good judge of the men in his life. Under the next monarch, James I, he made an equally unwise choice when he threw in his lot with the duke of Buckingham just prior to his disgrace. Bacon's mother complained frequently that he indulged his male servants and turned a blind eye to their petty thieving.

At the time the ﬁrst edition of The New Organon appeared in 1620, as part of a volume publicly presenting in full for the ﬁrst time the ambitious plan for Bacon's ‘Great Instauration', or ‘Renewal', of learning, its author was at the high point of his political career. After a series of unsuccessful bids for oﬃce under Queen Elizabeth, Bacon's fortunes had slowly improved with the accession of King James in 1603. After 1616, when he became a Privy Councillor and close conﬁdant of the king, his career ﬁnally took oﬀ. He was made Lord Keeper in 1617 (an oﬃce his father had held under Queen Elizabeth), then Lord Chancellor and Baron Verulam in 1618. According to contemporaries, his lifestyle quickly grew in grandeur to match his high oﬃce. He kept a vast retinue, dressed his servants and himself with an ostentation verging on the unseemly, and entertained prodigiously and lavishly. [1]

With hindsight, we, of course, know that by the middle of 1621 Bacon had lost everything – impeached, disgraced, brieﬂy imprisoned in the Tower, then banished permanently to the enforced leisure of his country home. But at court and in the intellectual community at large The New Organon must have seemed, in October 1620, like the culminating achievement of one of the brightest stars in England's political ﬁrmament.

The work's ambitiousness matched that of its author; nor did Bacon separate this bid for worldwide intellectual recognition from his more parochial aspirations at the English court. It would, he hoped, further cement the king's personal commitment to him. In a private letter to James accompanying the presentation copy, Bacon ﬂattered him with the suggestion that he was the person at whom the entire ‘Great Instauration' was directed:

The work, in what colours soever it may be set forth, is no more than a new logic, teaching to invent and judge by induction (as ﬁnding syllogism incompetent for sciences of nature), and thereby to make philosophy and sciences both more true and more active. This, tending to enlarge the bounds of Reason and endow man's estate with new value, was no improper oblation to your Majesty, who, of men, is the greatest master of reason, and author of beneﬁcence.

弗朗西斯·培根（Francis Bacon）于 1561 年出生，是尼古拉斯·培根爵士（Sir Nicholas Bacon）—— 伊丽莎白一世女王的大法官 —— 的第五个也是最小的幸存儿子，同时是他第二任妻子的第二个幸存子嗣。尼古拉斯在 1552 年守寡后，带着六个不满十二岁的孩子，很快娶了安妮·库克（Anne Cooke），她是爱德华六世的导师安东尼·库克爵士（Sir Anthony Cooke）五个受过良好教育的女儿之一。这些女儿都与她们的父亲一样以学识和虔诚著称，并且都结了极为有利的婚姻。最重要的是，米尔德雷德成为了后来成为伊丽莎白女王首席国务秘书的威廉·塞西尔的第二任妻子。因此，弗朗西斯与当时的一些最有权势和影响力的人物有亲属关系。

这对他来说非常重要，因为他一生都在努力应对父亲留下的经济不足问题。尼古拉斯爵士在意外去世（1579 年）时，正计划为弗朗西斯及其哥哥安东尼购买合适的长期土地。培根后来声称，如果这项安排完成，他本可以将一生都投入到研究中，他关于全新学习系统的宏伟计划可能就能在他有生之年实现。然而，他不得不追求一份公职生涯，在 1580 年代起在伦敦的格雷法学院（Gray's Inn）从事法律工作。大约在 1590 年，弗朗西斯和安东尼为了稳固他们的财务前景，加入了埃塞克斯伯爵的服务，担任学术秘书和情报搜集员。

鉴于他与女王的关系多变，选择埃塞克斯作为支持者是个错误的决定。在埃塞克斯叛乱之后（埃塞克斯被处决），弗朗西斯在政治上幸存下来。但培根一直不擅长判断生命中的男性。在下一位国王詹姆斯一世（James I）统治下，他同样做出了愚蠢的选择，当他在自己的耻辱之前与白金汉公爵结盟。培根的母亲经常抱怨他溺爱他的男仆，并对他们的小偷小摸视而不见。

《新工具》（The New Organon）的首版于 1620 年出版，作为首次公开全面展示弗朗西斯·培根「大复兴」（Great Instauration）或学术「更新」（Renewal）宏伟计划的一部分，其作者正处于他政治生涯的巅峰。经历了在伊丽莎白女王统治下多次竞选官职失败后，培根的命运在 1603 年詹姆斯国王即位后逐渐好转。1616 年，当他成为枢密顾问和国王的密友后，他的职业生涯终于起飞。1617 年，他被任命为大法官（这是他父亲在伊丽莎白女王时期所担任的职位），随后在 1618 年被封为贵族和维鲁拉姆男爵（Baron Verulam）。据当时人描述，他的生活方式迅速变得奢华，以匹配他的高级职位。他保留了庞大的随从队伍，以近乎不体面的豪华装扮自己和仆人，并且举办极其奢侈的宴会。[1]

事后看来，我们当然知道，到了 1621 年中期，培根已经失去了一切 —— 被弹劾、遭受耻辱、短暂被关押在伦敦塔中，随后永远被流放到他的乡村家中。但在 1620 年 10 月，对于宫廷和整个知识界来说，《新工具》似乎是英格兰政坛中最耀眼的明星之一的顶峰成就。

这部作品的雄心壮志与其作者相匹配；培根也没有将这一争取全球知识界认可的努力与他在英格兰宫廷的更地方性的抱负分开。他希望，这将进一步巩固国王对他的个人承诺。在递交给国王的致礼副本的私人信中，培根以建议国王是整个「大复兴」计划的指向对象来奉承他：

这部作品，无论以何种颜色展现，不过是一种新的逻辑，教导通过归纳来发明和判断（因为发现三段论不适用于自然科学），从而使哲学和科学变得更真实和更活跃。这旨在扩大理性的界限，并赋予人类命运新的价值，对于贵国陛下来说，这并不是一份不合适的奉献，因为在众人中，陛下是理性的最伟大的大师，也是恩惠的创造者。[2]

### 01. A history of experiments

A ‘Great Renewal' of learning written by the Lord Chancellor was guaranteed a serious reception as a work of philosophy. In December 1620, just two months after its oﬃcial publication date, the English diplomat Henry Wotton, on a mission to Vienna, wrote to Bacon to acknowledge safe receipt of three copies of The New Organon.

He was not yet in a position to comment on the philosophical work, Wotton apologised, ‘having yet read only the ﬁrst Book thereof, and a few Aphorismes of the second'. For the time being, therefore, he would instead make a modest practical contribution to the Lord Chancellor's grand scientiﬁc project, for which The New Organon was to provide the method-ological infrastructure. Wotton had apparently agreed to send Bacon reports of interesting scientiﬁc matters he encountered in the course of his embassy: ‘I owe your Lordship even by promise (which you are pleased to remember, thereby doubly binding me) some trouble this way: I mean by the commerce of Philosophical experiments, which surely, of all other, is the most ingenious Traﬃck.'

Wotton went on to tell Bacon that he had just returned from a visit to the home of the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler. He had, indeed, decided to present Kepler with one of the copies of The New Organon sent by Bacon, ‘that he may see that we have some of our own that can honour our King, as well as he hath done with his Harmonice Mundi'. In Kepler's study Wotton had seen a most remarkable piece of scientiﬁc apparatus in action:

He hath a little black tent, exactly close and dark, save at one hole, about an inch and an half in the Diameter, to which he applies a long perspective-tube, with the convex glasse ﬁtted to the said hole, and the concave taken out at the other end, through which the visible radiations of all the objects without are intromitted falling upon a paper, which is accommodated to receive them. And so he traceth them with his Pen in their natural appearance, turning his little Tent round by degrees till he hath designed the whole aspect of the ﬁeld. [3]

Here, clearly, was a device with a whole range of possible applications. Kepler's ‘little black tent' was a reﬁned version of a favourite piece of seventeenth-century European new technology, the camera obscura. It would, Wotton pointed out, be a particularly useful technical tool for covertly drawing accurate maps and harbour plans.

Wotton's letter (which Bacon's nineteenth-century editor Spedding omitted from his deﬁnitive edition)4 shows how Bacon's political status at home allowed him unusually direct access to emerging seventeenth-century science on the mainland of Europe. It belongs alongside two letters sent by Bacon's friend Toby Matthew from Italy, the ﬁrst written in 1616 (also omitted from the Works by Spedding) and reporting Galileo's support for Copernican astronomy, the second informing Bacon that Galileo had produced a written response to Bacon's own paper on the ebb and ﬂow of tides. Together they conﬁrm that Bacon did not simply comment on, but took an active part in, what stands today as cutting-edge European scientiﬁc thought of his day.

Although Wotton had barely begun reading the second book of The New Organon when he wrote to Bacon, he was correct in anticipating that the camera obscura was not mentioned among the examples of new technology in the ‘privileged instances' section of the book. Bacon did, however, there discuss a related piece of lens technology, the microscope, , in some detail.

Among the ‘privileged instances' which specially advance the investigation of nature, Bacon lists ‘instances that open doors or gates' – instances which ‘assist direct actions of the sense'. The microscope falls within this category of valuable aids to the senses:

Apart from spectacles and such things, whose function is simply to correct and alleviate the weakness of impaired vision, and so provide no new information, [such] an instance … are microscopes, lately invented, which (by remarkably increasing the size of the specimens) reveal the hidden, invisible small parts of bodies, and their latent structure and motions. By their means the exact shape and features of the body in the ﬂea, the ﬂy and worms are viewed, as well as colours and motions not previously visible, to our great amazement. (II.39)

Bacon's information on the moving parts of tiny organisms made visible by the microscope came from closer to hand than the written reports he received of Continental scientiﬁc activity. William Harvey (of circulation-of-the-blood fame) recorded in his landmark work On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals, published originally in Latin as De motu cordis, two years after Bacon's death, in 1628:

In bees, ﬂies, hornets, and the like, we can perceive something pulsating with the help of a lens; in pediculi [little lice], also, the same thing may be seen, and as the body is transparent, the passage of the food through the intestines, like a black spot or stain, may be perceived by the aid of the same magnifying lens. [5]

For Harvey the value of such observations was as ‘ocular' conﬁrmation that the heart acts as a pneumatic pump, driving the blood in a perpetual circuit around the body of an animal, whatever its size. The anatomical investigations which clinched his revolutionary discovery were, of course, conducted on much larger-scale organisms. As Physician Extraordinary to James I (and later to his son Charles), Harvey had access to a wide and exotic range of animals on whose living and dead bodies he could experiment. By 1616, when he ﬁrst outlined the theory of blood circulation in the Lumleian Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians, he had dissected not only human cadavers but innumerable royal deer and an ostrich from the king's menagerie; he had also conducted simple vivisectional experiments on domestic animals and excised the hearts of live vipers. [6]

Bacon was at one time one of Harvey's aristocratic patients (in 1619 both Bacon and the king suﬀered extended bouts of the stone). [7] According to John Aubrey, Harvey recalled that Bacon had the cold hazel eyes of the vipers on his dissection table. It was also Harvey who observed to Aubrey of Bacon that ‘he writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor' – which comment, Aubrey adds, was meant ‘in derision'. In The New Atlantis, it is the Royal Physician's anatomical dissections which Bacon has in mind when he describes how his ideal scientists in the imaginary land of Bensalem kept ‘inclosures of all sorts of beasts and birds, which [they] use not only for view or rareness, but like-wise for dissections and trials; that thereby [they] may take light what may be wrought upon the body of man'.8 In The New Organon, it is Harvey to whom Bacon also alludes when he remarks, in the context of observing the natural processes of generation and growth in animals:

It would be inhuman to make such investigations of well-formed animals ready for birth, by cutting the foetuses out of the womb, except for accidental abortions and in hunting, and so on. (II.41)

To understand The New Organon in the spirit in which it was written, we need to be clear that it is driven by a strong commitment to new technical scientiﬁc instruments and the increasing variety of experiments on nature they made possible. The New Organon belongs to an early-seventeenth-century English intellectual milieu which included William Gilbert's work with magnetism and Harvey's on the circulation of the blood, which took into account technological innovation on the Continent, and which looked forward to Robert Boyle's and Robert Hooke's experiments with air-pumps in the 1650s. It is an extraordinary attempt to give formal shape to a rapidly emerging (but hitherto largely problem-driven and ad hoc) new experimentally based science.

[4] Spedding keeps Bacon's ‘life' (of which his letters are obviously a crucial part) separate from his ‘works' (his published science and philosophy). He therefore consistently excludes letters which refer directly to Bacon's scientiﬁc practice. See L. Jardine and A.

由大法官撰写的关于学问「大更新」的作品自然会作为一部哲学著作受到严肃的接待。在 1620 年 12 月，即正式出版日期后仅两个月，英国外交官亨利·沃顿在前往维也纳执行任务时，写信给培根，确认已经安全收到了《新工具论》的三份副本。

沃顿道歉表示，他还未能对这部哲学作品发表评论，因为「他只读了其中的第一本书，以及第二本书的一些格言」。因此，暂时他将为大法官宏大的科学项目做出一些实际的贡献，《新工具论》将为此提供方法论基础。沃顿显然同意向培根报告他在使馆工作中遇到的有趣科学事项：「我欠阁下一个承诺（您愿意记住这一点，因此使我双重受约束），在这方面给您带来一些麻烦：我指的是通过哲学实验的交流，这无疑是所有其他交易中最具创新性的一种。」

沃顿接着告诉培根，他刚从著名天文学家约翰内斯·开普勒的家中回来。实际上，他决定将培根寄来的《新工具论》的一份副本赠送给开普勒，「让他看看我们也有人能像他用他的《世界和谐》一样为我们的国王增光添彩」。在开普勒的书房里，沃顿看到了一个极为引人注目的科学装置正在运作：

他有一个小黑帐篷，完全密闭且一片漆黑，除了一个大约一英寸半直径的孔。他把一个长的望远镜管对准这个孔，凸透镜适配于该孔，而凹透镜则安装在另一端，通过它，外部所有物体的可见辐射被引入，落在一张适合接收它们的纸上。他用笔在纸上按它们的自然外观描绘它们，逐渐转动他的小帐篷，直到绘制出整个田野的全景。

显然，这是一个具有广泛可能应用的装置。开普勒的「小黑帐篷」是 17 世纪欧洲新技术 —— 暗箱 —— 的精致版本。沃顿指出，这将是一个特别有用的技术工具，用于秘密绘制精确的地图和港口规划。

沃顿的信件（培根 19 世纪的编辑斯佩丁在其权威版中省略了这封信）4 显示了培根在国内的政治地位使他能够异常直接地接触到欧洲大陆新兴的 17 世纪科学。这封信与培根的朋友托比·马修从意大利发来的两封信并列，第一封写于 1616 年（也被斯佩丁从作品中省略），报告了伽利略对哥白尼天文学的支持，第二封通知培根，伽利略已经对培根关于潮汐涨落的论文做出了书面回应。这些一起证实了培根不仅仅是对当时欧洲尖端科学思想发表评论，而且还积极参与其中。

尽管沃顿在写信给培根时刚刚开始阅读《新工具论》的第二本书，但他正确地预见到暗箱并没有在书中「特权实例」部分提及的新技术例子中被提到。然而，培根确实在那里详细讨论了一个相关的镜头技术 —— 显微镜。

在特别推进自然研究的「特权实例」中，培根列举了「打开门或大门的实例」—— 这些实例「帮助感官直接行动」。显微镜属于这类对感官有价值的辅助工具：

除了眼镜等，其功能仅仅是纠正和减轻视力受损的弱点，因此不提供新信息外，[这样的] 实例... 是近来发明的显微镜，它们（通过显著增大样本的大小）揭示了身体隐藏的、看不见的小部分，以及它们的潜在结构和运动。通过它们，我们可以观察到跳蚤、苍蝇和蠕虫体内确切的形状和特征，以及之前看不见的颜色和运动，令我们大为惊奇。

贝肯对显微镜下微小生物的运动部分的了解，不仅来自他收到的有关欧洲大陆科学活动的书面报告，更多的是来自近距离的观察。著名的哈维医生（因发现血液循环而闻名）在他的开创性著作《动物的心脏和血液运动》中，这本书最初用拉丁文《De motu cordis》发表，在贝肯去世两年后的 1628 年出版，记载了以下内容：

我们可以用透镜观察到蜜蜂、苍蝇、黄蜂等昆虫的某种跳动；在小虱子（pediculi）身上也能看到相似现象。由于它们身体透明，我们甚至可以看到食物如同黑点或污渍般穿过肠道。【5】

对哈维来说，这些观察是眼见为实的证据，证明心脏像一个气动泵一样，推动血液在动物体内不断循环，无论体型大小。哈维革命性的发现，是通过在大型生物身上进行的解剖学研究得到证实的。作为詹姆斯一世（及其儿子查尔斯）的御用医师，哈维有机会接触到各种奇特的动物，对它们的活体和尸体进行实验。1616 年，在皇家医学院 Lumleian 讲座上首次提出血液循环理论时，他不仅解剖了人类遗体，还解剖了大量皇家鹿和国王动物园的鸵鸟；他还在家养动物身上进行了简单的活体解剖实验，并取出了活蝰蛇的心脏。

贝肯曾经是哈维的贵族病人之一，在 1619 年，贝肯和国王都经历了长期的结石疾病。【7】根据历史学家约翰·奥布里的记载，哈维曾回忆起贝肯有着类似于他解剖台上蝰蛇的冷漠榛色眼睛。哈维还对奥布里说过，贝肯写哲学「像一位大法官」，奥布里补充说这是出于嘲讽。在《新亚特兰蒂斯》一书中，贝肯脑海中的是皇家医师进行的解剖学研究，他描述了在想象中的班撒伦国，科学家们养有各种动物和鸟类，不仅是为了观赏或稀奇，而且用于解剖和试验，以此来探索对人体可能产生的影响。【8】在《新工具书》中，贝肯在讨论动物的自然生长和繁殖过程时，也提到了哈维的观点：

贝肯认为，除了偶然的流产和狩猎等情况外，从子宫中割出即将出生的完整动物胎儿进行研究是不人道的。（II.41）

要真正理解《新工具书》的写作精神，我们需要知道它是基于对新技术科学仪器的强烈承诺，以及它们使得可能的自然实验的日益增加。《新工具书》是 17 世纪早期英国智识环境的产物，包括威廉·吉尔伯特在磁学上的研究、哈维关于血液循环的研究，这些研究考虑到了欧洲大陆的技术创新，并预见到了罗伯特·波伊尔和罗伯特·胡克在 1650 年代使用空气泵进行的实验。这是一次对迅速出现但之前多基于问题驱动和临时的基于实验的新科学进行形式化尝试的非凡举措。

### 02. The new scientiﬁc method

Bacon's Novum Organum, or The New Organon, takes its title from Aristotle's work on logic, the ‘Organon' or ‘Instrument for Rational Thinking'. Bacon argued vigorously in his Advancement of Learning that Aristotle's logic was entirely unsuitable for the pursuit of knowledge in the ‘modern' age. Accordingly, The New Organon propounds a system of reasoning to supersede Aristotle's, suitable for the pursuit of knowledge in the age of science. Where Aristotle's inferential system based on syllogisms could reliably derive conclusions which were logically consistent with an argument's premises, Bacon's system was designed to investigate the fundamental premises themselves. Aristotle's logic proposed certainty, based on incontrovertible premises accepted unquestioningly as true; Bacon proposed an inductive inference, based upon a return to the raw evidence of the natural world. From painstakingly collected assemblages of data (‘natural histories') the scientiﬁc investigator would use The New Organon to nudge his way gradually towards higher levels of probability. [9]

The New Organon was the second part of the six-part programme of scientiﬁc inquiry assembled under the title The Great Instauration, or ‘Great Renewal', of learning. As Bacon explains in the published introduction to the The New Organon volume, the ﬁrst part was to consist of ‘the divisions of the sciences', comprising ‘a Summary or general description of the science or learning which the human race currently possesses' (‘Plan of the Work'). Since this part of the enterprise remained incomplete in 1620 (as indeed it did at Bacon's death), the title page to The New Organon explains that some account of them will be found in the Second Book of The Advancement of Learning.




Beyond the second part of The Great Instauration as presented in The New Organon, all further parts remained, on Bacon's own admission, woefully incomplete. The third part was to be a comprehensive compilation of ‘the Phenomena of the Universe, that is, every kind of experience, and the sort of natural history which can establish the foundations of philosophy' (‘Plan'). Such a comprehensive collection of natural-historical data would include not simply all natural phenomena (‘a history of the bodies of heaven and the sky, of land and sea, of minerals, plants and animals'), but also compilations of the material in all existing academic disciplines, and histories of crafts, trades and other examples of nature ‘pressured and moulded' (ibid.). In several places in his works and letters, Bacon stresses that this project is a massive collaborative one, requiring the ﬁnancial and organisational backing of a ‘King or Pope'. [10]

Using the material from this databank, the fourth part was to be a collection of disparate and preliminary worked examples of the ‘method' of The New Organon in action. This is the vaguest of Bacon's sections, and our understanding of it is based on a single paragraph in the ‘Plan', together with some equally sketchy remarks in a letter written shortly before his death. There Bacon describes Part Four as ‘an intellectual machinery' comprising ‘axioms and higher level observations' of a kind already to be found in his own fragmentary Histories, but ‘better adjusted to the rules of the inductive method'.11 Presumably it would be a series of ‘systems', of limited explanatory force – like Gilbert's based on the principle of magnetism or Bacon's own based on his principle of motion. Ultimately such partial explanations would all be subsumed under the totalising explanatory system of the sixth part, where ‘the philosophy which is derived and formed from the kind of correct, pure, strict inquiry … already framed' is brought to completion (‘Plan'). This would ﬁnally allow mankind unlimited power to control the natural world not by coercion but by complete understanding:




For man is nature's agent and interpreter; he does and understands only as much as he has observed of the order of Nature in work or by inference; he does not know and cannot do more. No strength exists that can interrupt or break the chain of causes; and nature is conquered only by obedience. (Ibid.)

Completing the sixth part of The Great Instauration himself is, Bacon confesses, a thing both ‘beyond our ability and beyond our expectation'. For the time being, the ﬁfth part will consist of provisional discoveries, of the kind made by Bacon himself. These would ultimately be made obsolete by the grand design, but in the meantime would provide encouragement for those looking for tangible results.

Bacon's metaphor of such results being like interest payable upon a capital sum invested, which keep the investor going until the capital itself is redeemed, indicates the strenuously pragmatic thinking behind his philosophical undertaking. The kinds of investors he seeks for his Great Instauration need to know they can expect to make a rapid proﬁt. In the long term they may be prepared to indulge the Lord Chancellor in his pursuit of a single overarching system to explain the entire natural world. In the short term, they will need to see immediate pay-oﬀ in the form of enhanced procedures in traditional trade and manufacture. It was certainly this aspect of the Baconian project which Charles II, returning in 1660 to a ﬁnancially weakened England after the Commonwealth period, found particularly attractive when he agreed to give his name and political backing to the Bacon-inspired Royal Society (the ‘Royal Society of London, for Improving of Natural Knowledge', to give it its full title). [12]




[9] Bacon reminds his reader a number of times in The New Organon that his method bears a resemblance to that adopted by the ancients' ‘weak scepticism'. On weak scepticism as understood in the Renaissance see L. Jardine, ‘Lorenzo Valla: Academic Skepticism and the New Humanist Dialectic' in M. Burnyeat (ed.), The Skeptical Tradition (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1983), ch. 10, 253–86.

### 03. Observation and experiment

In spite of its reputation as a single-mindedly theoretical work of scientiﬁc epistemology, over half of Bacon's New Organon is taken up with examples from applied science which can be traced to contemporary experimental work in a broad range of emerging ﬁelds. [13]

What distinguishes the new Baconian view of science (as presented most

clearly in The New Organon ) from that of his predecessors is, indeed, his

clear commitment to the role of observation and experiment as a pre-

requisite for the construction of scientiﬁc theory itself. Earlier scientists

(and scientiﬁc near-contemporaries elsewhere in Europe) had thought of

observation and experiment as demonstrating a conclusion anticipated by

systematic deductive reasoning, or as determining a detail or ﬁlling in a

gap, as required to extend an existing theory. Thus, for instance, Robert

Boyle (a keen follower of Bacon) was quick to point out that Blaise Pascal's

‘experiments' in hydrostatics, adduced in support of his theoretical

principles, are clearly impossible-to-perform ‘thought experiments' whose

proposed outcomes are calculated to conﬁrm an already decided theory.

Bacon, by contrast, regarded observation and experiment – particularly

experiments designed to test how nature would behave under previously

unobserved circumstances – as the very foundation of science and its

generalised methodology. He expected that the process itself of organising

the mass of data collected into natural and experimental histories would

lead to an entirely new and largely unforeseen scientiﬁc theory.14

Among such groundbreaking experiments included in The New

Organon are a number which Bacon had clearly carried out himself, mostly

experiments in chemistry and mechanics (he may, however, like Boyle, have

had laboratory assistants who actually performed the experiments, while

he himself simply observed, as beﬁtted a gentleman). For example, in

Bacon's discussion of speciﬁc gravity, under ‘privileged instances' we ﬁnd

the following description of an experiment using equipment familiar to the

seventeenth-century alchemist or chemist:

We took a small glass bottle, which could hold perhaps one ounce (we used a small

vessel so that the consequent evaporation could be achieved with less heat). We

Frank, Harvey and the Oxford Physiologists, and S. Shapin and S. Schaﬀer, Leviathan and the

Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life (Princeton, , Princeton University Press, ).

It has recently been pointed out that Bacon was relatively cut oﬀfrom a speciﬁcally Continental tradition

in published natural history. See P. Findlen, ‘Francis Bacon and the Reform of Natural History in the

Seventeenth Century' in D. Kelley (ed.), History and the Disciplines: The Reclassiﬁcation of Knowledge in

Early Modern Europe (Rochester, , University of Rochester Press, ), –.

Introduction

ﬁlled this bottle with spirit of wine almost to the brim; selecting spirit of wine

because we observed by means of an earlier table that it is the rarest of the tangible

bodies (which are continuous, not porous), and contains the least matter for its

dimensions. Then we accurately noted the weight of the liquid with the bottle

itself. Next we took a bladder which would hold about two pints. We expelled all

the air from it, so far as possible, to the point that the sides of the bladder were

touching each other; we had also previously smeared the bladder with grease,

rubbing it gently in so that it would be more eﬀectively closed, its porosity, if there

was any, being sealed by the oil. We tied this bladder tightly around the mouth of

the bottle, with its mouth inside the mouth of the bladder, lightly waxing the

thread so that it would stick better and bind more tightly. Finally we placed the

bottle above burning coals in a brazier.

Bacon goes on to describe the carefully observed and quantiﬁed outcome

of the experiment:

Very soon a steam or breath of spirit of wine, expanded by heat and turned into

gaseous form, gradually inﬂated the bladder, and stretched the whole thing in

every direction like a sail. As soon as this happened, we removed the glass from the

ﬁre, and placed it on a rug so that it would not be cracked by the cold; we also

immediately made a hole in the top of the bladder, so that when the heat ceased,

the steam would not return to liquid form and run down and spoil the measure-

ment. Then we lifted up the bladder itself and again took the weight of the spirit

of wine which remained. Then we calculated how much had been used up as steam

or gas; and making a comparison as to how much place or space that substance had

ﬁlled in the bottle when it was spirit of wine, and then how much space it ﬁlled

after it had become gas in the bladder, we calculated the ratio; and it was absolutely

clear that the substance thus converted and changed had achieved a hundredfold

expansion over its previous state. (. (, ))

This is a perfectly respectable experiment in expansion of gases, of the kind

Robert Boyle would be performing in Oxford by the s. It involves

calibration and quantiﬁcation: spirit of wine, or brandy, is chosen because

it vaporises at low temperatures; the quantity of brandy vaporised is

calculated by weighing the container before and after heating; the volume

to which the vaporised brandy expanded is calculated by calculating the

volume of the bladder. The ﬁnding was that the vaporised brandy ‘had

achieved a hundredfold expansion over its previous state'.

Bacon lets his reader know clearly, by the formal locutions he uses, when

it is he who has conducted experiments and when he has merely ‘heard tell'

or read about them at second hand. In another of his own experiments,

described under ‘privileged instances' of ‘range or furthest limit', he tested

xvi

Introduction

‘how much compression or expansion bodies easily and freely allow (in

accordance with their natures), and at what point they begin to resist, so

that at the extreme they bear it No Further [ne plus ultra]':

as when an inﬂated bladder is compressed, it tolerates some compression of the air,

but after a point it can bear it no longer, and the bladder bursts.

We tested this more precisely with a subtle experiment. We took a small metal

bell, quite thin and light, like a saltcellar, and sank it in a basin of water, so that it

took with it to the bottom of the basin the air held in its cavity. We had ﬁrst placed

a little ball on the bottom of the basin on which to set the bell. The result was that

if the ball was quite small (in relation to the cavity) the air retreated into a smaller

area, and was simply compressed and not expelled. But if it was too large for

the air to give way freely, then the air could not tolerate the greater pressure but

partially lifted the little bell and came up in bubbles. (.)

This kind of experiment with bells is related to contemporary practical

experiments with diving-bells. Sure enough, under ‘multi-purpose

instances' Bacon refers directly to the technology of diving-bells for

salvage operations:

If the situation requires bodies to be submerged in a depth of water, a river perhaps

or the sea, but not to have contact with the water, and not to be shut up in sealed

vessels but to be just surrounded by air, very useful is the vessel which is some-

times used to work under the water on sunken ships, which enables divers to stay

under water longer and to take breaths in turn from time to time. It was like this.

A concave metal barrel [bell] was constructed, and was let down evenly into the

water, its mouth parallel to the surface; in this way it carried all the air it contained

with it to the bottom of the sea. It stood on three feet (like a tripod) which were a

little shorter than a man, so that when a diver ran out of breath, he could put his

head into the hollow of the jar, take a breath, and then continue with his work. We

have heard that a device has just been invented like a small ship or boat, which can

carry men under water for a certain distance. Under the kind of jar we mentioned

above, certain bodies could easily be suspended; that is why we adduced this

experiment. (. ())

At the end of this passage we have evidence that Bacon was aware of a

celebrated English demonstration of Cornelis Drebbel's ‘submarine' (‘we

have heard that …') and that he anticipated the kinds of experiments in an

evacuated chamber carried out forty years later using Boyle's air-pump.

The coherence of Bacon's new scientiﬁc method, upon which his ‘Great

Renewal' of learning rests, depends upon a close relationship between

experimental practice and methodical processing of results. This was

xvii

Introduction

clearly understood by the early Royal Society in London, for whom the

great Verulam (Sir Francis Bacon) was ﬁgurehead, patron saint and ‘Father

of Modern Science'. Early Restoration scientists like Royal Society

Curator of Experiments Robert Hooke took The Great Instauration entirely

seriously and modelled their own programmes for an experimentally based

science directly on Bacon's writings on methodology.15

By the end of the nineteenth century, however, attention had become

focused almost exclusively upon the formal validity of the inductive

method of The New Organon, and its adequacy as a substitute for the

logico-deductive epistemology which it supposedly superseded.16 In most

modern accounts of Baconian method, the groundbreaking originality of

Bacon's direct engagement with contemporary applied science and tech-

nology, leading to his attempt to devise an epistemology which reﬂected

the intimate relationship in science between ideas and practice, has been

lost from sight.17

### 04. Baconian induction

The New Organon is laid out in two books of ‘aphorisms'. These are

relatively concise, unembellished statements designed to indicate that this

is ‘work in progress', susceptible of improvement and reﬁnement, rather

than a ﬁnished and coherent ‘Organon'. The aphoristic ‘method of delivery'

ensures that the reader understands that the work is incomplete, and also

reveals clearly the competence of the author. As Bacon explained three

years later, in the expanded Latin version of the Advancement of Learning:

Delivery by aphorisms . . . tries the writer, whether he be light and superﬁcial in

his knowledge or solid. For aphorisms, not to be ridiculous, must be made out of

the pith and heart of sciences … A man will not be equal to writing in aphorisms,

nor indeed will he think of doing so, unless he feels that he is amply and solidly

furnished for the work.18

of Bacon's Scientiﬁc Method' in W. Sessions (ed.), Francis Bacon's Legacy of Texts (New York, AMS

Press, ), –.

Introduction

Aphorisms have the further advantage that they encourage collaborative

pursuit of knowledge and ‘invite others to contribute and add something

in their turn'.

Book One of The New Organon clears away the intellectual debris of

existing assumptions which distort the perceptions and cloud the judge-

ment of the would-be philosopher. Bacon urges readers not to place their

trust in existing authorities, nor to rush to fashionable new systems of

knowledge. ‘A new beginning [to learning] has to be made from the lowest

foundations, unless one is content to go round in circles for ever' (.).

To this end, Bacon ﬁrst discards the cornerstone of traditional logic, the

syllogism, because anyone using it can only arrive at conclusions consistent

with existing, given premises. These premises themselves – the assertions

on which the whole process of reasoning is based – must be taken on trust

as true and incontrovertible. The syllogism ‘is not applied to the principles

of the sciences, and is applied in vain to the middle axioms, since it is by no

means equal to the subtlety of nature' (.). Thus the entire current system

of reasoning, in Bacon's view, fails. Instead Bacon gives notice that his own

logic will be an induction or gradual ascent from sense data to generalisa-

tions, though not the ‘ordinary induction' of the logic handbooks.19

A signiﬁcant portion of Book One of The New Organon is taken up with

discussion of what Bacon names the ‘Idols', or ‘Illusions' – impediments

of various kinds which interfere with the processes of clear human reason-

ing. These so-called Idols are of four kinds: Idols of the Tribe, Idols of the

Cave, Idols of the Marketplace and Idols of the Theatre.

The Idols of the Tribe are errors in perception itself, caused by the lim-

itations of the human senses which give access to the data of nature. The

Idols of the Cave, by contrast, are errors introduced by each individual's

personal prejudices and attachment to particular styles or modes of expla-

nation – as in his fellow-courtier (and personal physician to Elizabeth I)

William Gilbert's trying to account for all natural phenomena in terms of

magnetism.20

19 On induction in the logic manuals see L. Jardine, ‘Humanistic Logic' in C. B. Schmitt, E. Kessler and

Q. R. D. Skinner (eds.), The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy (Cambridge, Cambridge

University Press, ), -. On Bacon's rejection of the syllogism see L. Jardine, Francis Bacon:

Discovery and the Art of Discourse (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, ), –.

20 William Gilbert (c. –), personal physician to Elizabeth I, is known for his early studies on

electricity and magnetism. He received his .. in  from Cambridge University, where he had

been made a Fellow of St John's College in ; in  he was elected President of the Royal

College of Physicians. In the same year he published De magnete, in which he propounded the

theory that the earth was a giant lodestone with north and south magnetic poles.

xix

Introduction

The Idols of the Marketplace arise directly from shared use of language

and from commerce between people. At the most basic level, the ascription

of names to things, in ordinary language usage, fails to discriminate

properly between distinctive phenomena, or names abstract entities

‘vaguely', so as to give rise to false beliefs about them.

Finally, Idols of the Theatre are the misleading consequences for human

knowledge of the systems of philosophy and rules of demonstration

(reliable proof) currently in place. These Bacon insists are ‘so many plays

produced and performed which have created false and ﬁctitious worlds'

(.). It is here that Bacon expounds his antipathy towards existing

philosophies, most notably the Aristotelian system which exercised a

virtual stranglehold on contemporary thought, but extending also to

Platonism and the methods of philosophical doubt of the Sceptics.21

The ﬁnal aphorisms of Book One deal with the characteristics of a

scientiﬁc method which will be adequate to handle the proliferation of

innovation in practical science, and to process the ‘stock and material

of natural history and experience' (.). It will be based on improved

natural histories (to be described in the third part of The Great Instauration),

and it will employ an entirely new form of induction (the subject of Book

Two of The New Organon). Used together, these will revolutionise learn-

ing and ﬁnally give mankind that power over nature of which early scientists

such as the alchemists could only dream.

Book One of The New Organon contains some shrewd insights,

particularly into the shortcomings of burgeoning science as currently

practised. Bacon points out, for instance, that the alchemist, attempting to

transmute base metal into gold, commits himself to performing a single

chain of experimental operations according to secret instructions. When

this does not succeed, the practitioner does not discard the recipe; rather

‘He accuses himself of not properly understanding the words of the art

or of the authors … or of making a slip in the weights or timing of his

procedure, and so proceeds to repeat the experiment indeﬁnitely' (.).22

Not only is this a perceptive description of seventeenth-century chemical

procedures, it also suggests that Bacon had himself observed contemporary

proto-chemists at work in the laboratory.23

21 For Bacon's disdainful attitude to ancient philosophies see Advancement of Learning, Book One.

22 For the accuracy of this account of alchemical practice, compare L. M. Principe, The Aspiring Adept:

Robert Boyle and his Alchemical Quest (Princeton, , Princeton University Press, ).

23 Bacon's observation of the alchemist's practice anticipates Thomas Kuhn's recognition that the

scientist does not generally discard a ‘paradigm' or model for scientiﬁc practice merely because he

is unable to replicate predicted outcomes. See T. S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions

(Chicago, University of Chicago, ).

Introduction

The goal of Bacon's inductive method is the ‘forms', or essential deﬁn-

itions, of what he terms ‘simple natures' – the fundamental building blocks

out of which all compound bodies are, in his view, constructed. The pro-

cedure for ﬁnding the form of a simple nature is clearly set out at the begin-

ning of Book Two of The New Organon. The investigator starts by collect-

ing into a History all available occurrences of the nature selected (Bacon

chooses the simple nature ‘heat' for his worked example). From among

these he selects those which provide as clear as possible a picture of the

nature's production. These are organised, tabulated and collated and any

gaps ﬁlled in with examples drawn from specially designed experiments.

Together they form a ‘table of presence'.

A second table is now drawn up, in which the instances of presence of the

selected nature are matched as closely as possible by ones from which it is

absent (if the rays of the sun are an instance of presence of heat, the rays of

the moon are an instance of absence). These two tables are supplemented by

one which lists instances where the increase or decrease of the nature is

accompanied by increase or decrease of other properties present, indicating

that these may be essential concomitants of the nature under investigation.

Bacon's ‘induction' is carried out by eliminating extraneous and redundant

material between the three tables, to yield an essential physical description of

the simple nature – its ‘form'. This simple elimination is the unique legiti-

mate use of formal inference in the entire interpretation of nature.24

All further steps in the process of reﬁning the ‘simple natures' and their

essential ‘forms' depend directly on the observed outcomes of carefully

classiﬁed experiments. There will, Bacon makes clear, inevitably be such

further stages, until at some yet-to-be-determined date in the distant

future a single overarching explanatory theory is arrived at (by years of

assiduous practice and experiment).

In the meantime, of the ﬁfty-two aphorisms in Book Two of The New

Organon only the ﬁrst twenty are taken up with the inductive method. The

remaining aphorisms compile a collection of ‘privileged instances' under

various categories. These are types of experimental set-up which provide

particularly powerful kinds of tool for investigating nature.

### 05. Privileged instances

At this stage in the presentation of his ‘new instrument' for the interpre-

tation of nature, Bacon asks us, with characteristic intellectual candour, to

24 For a full account of Baconian method see Jardine, Francis Bacon, esp. ch. .

xxi

Introduction

adopt a vigorously pragmatic approach to achieving a ‘true and complete

induction'. The process of assembling tables of presence, absence and

variation for instances of any given nature and eliminating between them

will yield only a ‘ﬁrst harvest', or preliminary interpretation. What follows

is a series of types of ‘support' for the understanding. It is these ‘privileged

instances' which will extend and reﬁne the preliminary ﬁndings into a valid

‘form'. There are a number of types of instance of occurrence of any given

simple nature which reveal aspects of that nature with striking clarity. Such

instances allow the investigator to move decisively and particularly swiftly

towards identifying the fundamental characteristics which make up the

‘form' of the nature.

According to Bacon, what makes the twenty-seven types of ‘privileged

instances' of such signiﬁcance is that they allow the investigator to guide

the later stages of induction by using ‘the nature of things' themselves:

Our logic instructs the understanding and trains it, not (as common logic does) to

grope and clutch at abstracts with feeble mental tendrils, but to dissect nature

truly, and to discover the powers and actions of bodies and their laws limned in

matter. Hence this science takes its origin not only from the nature of the mind but

from the nature of things. (.)

A preliminary attempt at inductive solution begins the process. Privileged

instances direct and steer the investigation further in the right direction.

Those who have looked to Bacon for a genuinely new logic of scientiﬁc

inquiry have generally ignored the ‘privileged instances', since their

procedures, and the guidance they yield towards forms of simple natures,

are, on Bacon's own admission, observation- and experiment-led and

ad hoc. Besides, they reach their supplementary conclusions by conven-

tional deduction rather than by any kind of induction. Their relationship

to the preliminary ‘ﬁrst harvest' most closely resembles the way individual

cases at law are used to reﬁne legal precept in English case law: a broadly

applicable rule is agreed upon, and its impact is reﬁned by using the detail

of successive cases for clariﬁcation.25

In the light of developments in natural science later in the seventeenth

century and the so-called scientiﬁc revolution, however, the ‘privileged

instances' of The New Organon deserve particular attention for the

Bacon (Stanford, , Stanford University Press, ).

Introduction

evidence they provide of Bacon's being abreast of hotly debated issues in

contemporary science, and for his clear sense that they provide proper

guidance in a generalised methodology for the sciences. Under ‘instances

of alliance' (ones which determine whether phenomena which tend to

occur together do so as cause and eﬀect or accidentally) he discusses

Gilbert's contention that all dense and solid bodies are magnets which

move towards the earth (itself a magnet) by attraction as long as they are

within the ‘circle of its own power' (.). The giant waterspouts observed

en route to the East and West Indies might suggest that at suﬃcient height

above the earth water escapes from its attractive force. Later, under

‘instances of range or furthest limit', Bacon returns to the same topic. Iron

within a certain distance of a magnet is drawn towards it, but not beyond.

If the earth is a giant magnet, its powers will extend to a great distance;

similarly for the moon's attractive force on the waters of the sea, which

causes high and low tides:

But whether the distance at which they work is great or small, all these things

certainly work at distances which are ﬁxed and known to nature, so that there is a

kind of No Further which is in proportion to the mass or quantity of the bodies; or

to the vigour or weakness of their powers; or to the assistance or resistance of the

surrounding medium; all of which should come into the calculation [be calculated]

and be noted. (.)

Scattered through the ‘privileged instances', observations like these reveal

Bacon's clear sense of what it would take methodologically to conﬁrm or

disprove a proposed theory.

Certain of Bacon's categories of ‘privileged instance' stand out as fore-

runners of later standard scientiﬁc procedures. His ‘crucial instances' (the

fourteenth of his types) list a selection of carefully designed experimental

set-ups on the basis of which the scientist can decide between alternative

views concerning the phenomena under investigation. These Bacon also

characterises as ‘decisive instances', ‘instances of verdicts' and ‘command-

ing instances':

Sometimes in the search for a nature the intellect is poised in equilibrium and can-

not decide to which of two or (occasionally) more natures it should attribute

or assign the cause of the nature under investigation … in these circumstances

crucial instances reveal that the fellowship of one of the natures with the nature

under investigation is constant and indissoluble, while that of the other is ﬁtful and

occasional. This ends the search as the former nature is taken as the cause and the

other dismissed and rejected. (.36)

xxiii

Introduction

It is here that Bacon discusses the nature of the ebb and ﬂow of tides at

length, incorporating his exchanges with Galileo and proposing several

decisive tests for competing contemporary conjectures.

The systematic guidance aﬀorded by procedures like those itemised

under his ‘privileged instances' belongs to what Bacon terms experientia

literata – ‘experience made literate'. Experientia literata allows the investi-

gator to organise the material gathered together in a given History so as to

extend the History itself (to yield a more precise deﬁnition of the ‘form'

under investigation). Experientia literata also throws up practical applica-

tions and scientiﬁc innovations (for trade and commercial beneﬁt) in

advance. In both cases, the process of reasoning which leads from particular

experiment or instance to generalisation is, according to Bacon, guided by

connections intrinsic to nature itself rather than connections imagined

by the human mind. Experientia literata thus binds together the stages in

ratiocination laid down for the ‘new instrument' and the material world to

which it is to be applied.

Beneﬁts derived during the process of systematic investigation are, how-

ever, Bacon stresses, still only provisional. In the end, experientia literata is

merely a stage on the way to ‘forms':

For although I do not deny that when all the experiments of all the arts shall

have been collected and digested, and brought within one man's knowledge and

judgment, the mere transferring of the experiments of one art to others may

lead, by means of that experience which I term ‘literate', to the discovery of

many new things of service to the life and state of man, yet it is no great matter

that can be hoped from that; but from the new light of axioms [generalisations],

which having been educed from those particulars by a certain method and rule,

shall in their turn point out the way again to new particulars, greater things may

be looked for.26

We look in vain for clear guidance in The New Organon as to how the

methodological derivation of ‘forms' and the axioms and rules which con-

nect them will eventually be brought to completion. Towards its close,

Book Two becomes a checklist of yet-to-be-investigated possibilities for

sharpening the outcome of Bacon's inductive method – a collection of Lord

Chancellor's jottings towards a future enlarged project. Like the ‘Plan'

which precedes The New Organon in the ﬁrst printed edition, and the

inventory of ‘Natural and Experimental Histories' which follows it, the

Introduction

philosophical method of the ‘new instrument' is itself (as the presentation

in aphoristic form is supposed to indicate) unﬁnished.

In many respects Baconian methodology has little relevance to the kinds

of debate around epistemology which preoccupy philosophers of science

today. Nevertheless, The New Organon remains a work of extraordinary

intellectual daring – a challenge to the entire ediﬁce of contemporary

philosophy and learning. It has left its mark on all subsequent philosophical

discussions of scientiﬁc method and has shaped accounts of the develop-

ment, from the seventeenth century onwards, of so-called English empiri-

cism. Bacon's symbolic role as a philosophical founding father, based on

his groundbreaking inductive method, is still aptly summed up in the

celebratory ode with which Abraham Cowley prefaced Thomas Sprat's

early History of the Royal Society ():

From these and all long Errors of the way,

In which our wandring Praedecessors went …

Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last,

The barren Wilderness he past,

Did on the very Border stand

Of the blest promis'd Land,

And from the Mountain Top of his Exalted Wit,

Saw it himself, and shewed us it.

### 06. Science and politics

Sprat gives us the heroic, intellectually uncompromising Francis Bacon. In

the end, however, Sir Francis Bacon, Earl Verulam, arch-pragmatist in

aﬀairs of state, was prepared to compromise even the intellectual rigour of

his New Organon for political expediency.

In theory, all existing philosophical systems must be abandoned to make

way for the one true inductive method. Still, Bacon relented when it came

to the kinds of gentlemanly debates on intellectual matters in which he and

his court friends engaged:

We do not in any way discourage these traditional subjects from generating dis-

putations, enlivening discourse and being widely applied to professional use and

the beneﬁt of civil life, and from being accepted by general agreement as a kind of

currency. Furthermore, we freely admit that our new proposals will not be very

useful for those purposes, since there is no way that they can be brought down to

the common understanding, except through their results and eﬀects. But our

xxv

Introduction

published writings (and especially the books On the Advancement of Learning)

testify how sincerely we mean what we say of our aﬀection and goodwill towards

the accepted sciences. (.)

Perhaps this is what William Harvey had in mind as philosophy practised

with the political tact of a Lord Chancellor. Here Bacon gives in to those

old friends of his, including Henry Wotton and Toby Matthew, on whose

support and informed comment on his philosophical writings he relied,

but who were deeply sceptical of his desire to start the whole enterprise of

science again from ﬁrst principles.

In , for instance, Bacon's long-time associate and amanuensis

Thomas Bodley wrote a detailed set of notes for Bacon on his Cogitata

et visa – early notes towards The New Organon. Bodley expressed broad

scepticism at the idea that knowledge grounded in worldwide ‘experience',

or observed reality, could be a substitute (rather than a supplement) for that

accumulated down through the ages. Suppose, he argued, we were ‘ﬁrst to

condemn our present knowledge of doubts and incertitude, and disclaim

all our axioms, maxims, and general assertions that are left by tradition

from our elders unto us, which (as it is to be intended) have passed all

probations of the sharpest wits that ever were'. Suppose we were to return,

as Bacon suggested, to an alphabet of nature, to rebuild science from ﬁrst

principles – a task which would inevitably take centuries. Then, Bodley

concluded, we would be likely to ﬁnd we had gone in a complete circle and

arrived back with the very science passed down to us by the ancients.27

The reader of The New Organon whom Bacon was keenest not to oﬀend,

and for whose sake he was willing to make as many intellectual compro-

mises as necessary, was of course the king himself. James prided himself on

being familiar with fashionable scientiﬁc debate. He responded in person

to Bacon's dedications (both printed and private ones), graciously

acknowledging receipt of the presentation copy of The New Organon. He

intended to participate fully in the further reﬁnement of the ‘new instru-

ment'. He was resolved, he wrote,

ﬁrst, to read it through with care and attention, though I should steal some hours

from my sleep; having otherwise as little spare time to read it as you had to write it.

And then to use the liberty of a true friend, in not sparing to ask you the question

in any point whereof I shall stand in doubt: as, on the other part, I will willingly

and in the general, I have already observed, that you jump with me, in keeping the

midway between the two extremes; as also in some particulars I have found that

you agree fully with my opinion.28

In his response, Bacon was understandably at pains to indicate that he

took the king's oﬀer entirely seriously. This would be a collaborative under-

taking between the sovereign and his Lord Chancellor. And even though

the guide to the inductive method was supposed to be sensory experience

alone, Bacon would stretch a point and allow a special place for the intel-

lectual observations of the king himself:

I cannot express how much comfort I received by your last letter of your own

royal hand … Your Majesty shall not only do to myself a singular favour, but to the

business a material help, if you will be graciously pleased to open yourself to me in

those things, wherein you may be unsatisﬁed. For though this work, as by position

and principle, doth disclaim to be tried by anything but by experience, and the

resultats of experience in a true way; yet the sharpness and profoundness of

your Majesty's judgment ought to be an exception to this general rule; and your

questions, observations, and admonishments, may do inﬁnite good.

Besides, if the king was to assist with framing the new logic itself, perhaps

he might be persuaded to put some ﬁnancial backing behind the ‘natural

and experimental histories' which were ultimately to underpin the whole

work:

This comfortable beginning makes me hope further, that your Majesty will be aid-

ing to me, in setting men on work for the collecting of a natural and experimental

history; which is basis totius negotii [grounds for the whole enterprise]; a thing

which I assure myself will be from time to time an excellent recreation unto you;

I say, to that admirable spirit of yours, that delighteth in light; and I hope well that

even in your times many noble inventions may be discovered for man's use. For

who can tell, now this mine of Truth is once opened, how the veins go, and what

lieth higher and what lieth lower?29

No doubt James was suitably ﬂattered at the idea that he might be

competent to suggest reﬁnements and modiﬁcations to the ‘Great

Instauration'. In private, however, he admitted candidly that Bacon's latest

Introduction

eﬀort was quite beyond his comprehension: ‘His last book is like the peace

of God, that passeth all understanding.' And as with so many of Bacon's

projects, the hoped-for funding, the investment which would make the

whole grand scientiﬁc enterprise possible, was not in the end forthcoming.

James Spedding, Bacon's devoted nineteenth-century editor and

defender of his reputation, was at great pains to separate Bacon the

philosopher and thinker from Bacon the political wheeler-dealer and time-

server. In his authoritative edition, contextual material has been as far as

possible removed from the philosophical and scientiﬁc works and is printed

at a distance, in the Letters and Life volumes.30 Within The New Organon

we can, nevertheless, trace the inevitable interconnectedness of the two,

and in the process arrive at a fuller understanding of Bacon's ground-

breaking philosophy.

## Preface

Those who have presumed to make pronouncements about nature as if it were a closed subject, whether they were speaking from simple conﬁdence or from motives of ambition and academical habits, have done very great damage to philosophy and the sciences. They have been successful in getting themselves believed and eﬀective in terminating and extinguishing investigation. They have not done so much good by their own abilities as they have done harm by spoiling and wasting the abilities of others. Those who have gone the opposite way and claimed that nothing at all can be known, whether they have reached this opinion from dislike of the ancient sophists or through a habit of vacillation or from a kind of surfeit of learning, have certainly brought good arguments to support their position. Yet they have not drawn their view from true starting points, but have been carried away by a kind of enthusiasm and artiﬁcial passion, and have gone beyond all measure. The earlier Greeks however (whose writings have perished) took a more judicious stance between the ostentation of dogmatic pronouncements and the despair of lack of conviction (acatalepsia);[20] and though they frequently complained and indignantly deplored the diﬃculty of investigation and the obscurity of things, like horses champing at the bit they kept on pursuing their design and engaging with nature; thinking it appropriate (it seems) not to argue the point (whether anything can be known), but to try it by experience. And yet they too, relying only on the impulse of the intellect, failed to apply rules, and staked everything on the mind's endless and aimless activity.

Our method, though diﬃcult to practise, is easy to formulate. It is to establish degrees of certainty, to preserve sensation by putting a kind of restraint on it, but to reject in general the work of the mind that follows sensation; and rather to open and construct a new and certain road for the mind from the actual perceptions of the senses. This was certainly seen also by those who have given such an important role to logic. Clearly they sought assistance for the understanding and distrusted natural and spontaneous movements of the mind. But this remedy was applied too late, when the situation was quite hopeless, after daily habits of life had let the mind be hooked by hearsay and debased doctrine, and occupied by thoroughly empty illusions. [21] And so the art of logic took its precautions too late, and altogether failed to restore the situation; and has had the eﬀect of ﬁxing errors rather than of revealing truth. There remains one hope of salvation, one way to good health: that the entire work of the mind be started over again; and from the very start the mind should not be left to itself, but be constantly controlled; and the business done (if I may put it this way) by machines. If men had tackled mechanical tasks with their bare hands and without the help and power of tools, as they have not hesitated to handle intellectual tasks with little but the bare force of their intellects, there would surely be very few things indeed which they could move and overcome, no matter how strenuous and united their eﬀorts. And if we might pause for a moment and look at an example, as if we were looking into a mirror, we might (if you please) ask the following: if an exceptionally heavy obelisk had to be moved to decorate a triumph or some such magniﬁcent show, and men tackled it with their bare hands, would not a sensible spectator regard it as an act of utter lunacy? And all the more so if they increased the number of workers thinking that that would do it? Would he not say they were still more seriously demented if they proceeded to make a selection, and set aside the weaker men and took only the young and the strong, and expected to achieve their ambition that way? And if not satisﬁed even with this, they decided to have recourse to the art of athletics, and gave orders that everyone should turn up with hands, arms and muscles properly oiled and massaged according to the rules of the art, would he not protest that what they were doing was simply a systematic and methodical act of insanity? And yet in intellectual tasks men are motivated by a similarly insane impulse and an equally ineﬀective enterprise when they expect much from either a cooperation of many minds or simple brilliance and high intelligence, or even when they improve the force of their minds with logic (which may be thought of as a kind of athletic art); and all the time, however much eﬀort and energy they put into it (if one looks at it from a proper perspective), they are using nothing but the naked intellect. Yet it is utterly obvious that in any major work that the human hand undertakes, the strength of individuals cannot be increased nor the forces of all united without the aid of tools and machines.

From the premises given, we conclude that there are two things which we should like to bring to men's attention, so that they do not escape them or pass unnoticed. The ﬁrst is this: by a happy chance (as we suppose) that tends to deﬂect and extinguish conceit and the spirit of contradiction, it is the case that we may carry out our design without touching or diminishing the honour and reverence due to the ancients, and still gather the fruit of our modesty. For if we maintained that we achieve better results than the ancients while following the same road as they, we should not by any skill with words be able to avoid setting up a comparison or contest in intellectual capacity or excellence. This by itself might not be wrong or unprecedented; for why might we not in our own right (which is the same right that everyone has) criticise or condemn anything which they have observed or assumed wrongly? And yet however justiﬁed or legitimate, the contest itself would still have been unequal because of the limitations of our resources. But since our concern is to open up a completely diﬀerent way to the intellect, unknown and untried by the ancients, the situation is quite diﬀerent; parties and partisanship are out; our role is merely that of a guide, and this surely carries little authority, and depends on fortune rather than on ability and excellence. And this kind of remark applies to persons; the following one to things themselves.

We have no intention of dethroning the prevailing philosophy, or any other now or in the future that may be more correct or complete. Nor do we want to stop this accepted philosophy and others of its kind from fuelling disputations, adorning discourses and being successfully employed in academic instruction and handbooks of civil life. In fact we frankly admit and declare that the philosophy which we are introducing will be quite useless for those purposes. It is not easy to get hold of, it cannot be picked up in passing, it does not ﬂatter intellectual prejudices, it will not adapt itself to the common understanding except in its utility and eﬀects.

Let there be two sources of learning therefore, and two means of dissemination (and may this be good and fortunate for both of them). Let there likewise be two clans or families of thinkers or philosophers; and let them not be hostile or alienated from each other, but allies bound together by ties of mutual assistance. And above all let there be one method for cultivating the sciences and a diﬀerent method for discovering them.

Those to whom the ﬁrst method is preferable and more acceptable, whether because of their haste or for reasons of civil life, or because they lack the intellectual capacity to grasp and master the other method, we pray that their activities go well for them and as they desire, and that they get what they are after. But any man whose care and concern is not merely to be content with what has been discovered and make use of it, but to penetrate further; and not to defeat an opponent in argument but to conquer nature by action; and not to have nice, plausible opinions about things but sure, demonstrable knowledge; let such men (if they please), as true sons of the sciences, join with me, so that we may pass the ante-chambers of nature which innumerable others have trod, and eventually open up access to the inner rooms. For better understanding, and to make what we mean more familiar by assigning names, we have chosen to call the one way or method the Anticipation of the Mind [22] and the other the Interpretation of Nature.

There is also a request which it seems we must make. We have thought hard and taken care that our proposals should not only be true but should enter men's minds easily and smoothly (occupied and blocked as they are in diﬀerent ways). But it is reasonable for us to request (especially in such a renewal of learning and the sciences) that no one who wishes to judge or reﬂect upon these our thoughts, whether of his own sense or with a host of authorities or by the forms of demonstration (which have the authority at present of judicial rules), should expect to be able to do this casually or while he is about something else, but should get to know the subject properly; should himself try a little the road which we are designing and building; should get used to the subtlety of things which experience suggests; should ﬁnally correct, within a fair and reasonable time, the bad mental habits which are so deeply ingrained; and then and only then (if he so please), after he has grown up and become his own master, let him use his own judgement.

那些认为自然是一个已封闭的领域而发表断言的人，不管他们是出于简单的自信还是出于野心和学术习惯，都对哲学和科学造成了巨大的损害。他们成功地让人们信服他们的观点，并有效地终止了进一步的调查研究。与他们自身的能力所做的贡献相比，他们更多地通过破坏和浪费他人的才能造成了伤害。而那些持相反观点，声称根本无法知晓任何事物的人，不论他们是因为厌恶古代诡辩家，还是因为习惯上的优柔寡断，或是因为知识的过饱和，他们的确为自己的立场提供了有力的论据。然而，他们并没有从真正的出发点出发，而是被一种热情和人为的激情所驱使，走得过远。然而，早期的希腊人（他们的著作已不存）在狂妄的教条式宣称和信念缺失的绝望（acatalepsia）之间采取了更明智的立场；[20] 虽然他们经常抱怨并愤慨地谴责调查的困难和事物的晦涩，但就像被勒住的马一样，他们坚持追求他们的目标，与自然互动；他们认为不应该讨论这个问题（是否可以知晓任何事物），而是应该通过实验来尝试。但即便如此，他们也只是依靠智力的冲动，没有运用规则，将一切赌注都放在了心智无休止且无目的的活动上。

我们的方法虽然实践起来困难，但表述却相对简单。其核心是建立确定性的程度，通过对感知加以一定的限制来保留感觉，但通常要拒绝心智在感知之后的加工；而是要为心智从感官的实际感知中开辟并构建一条新的、确定的道路。这一点也被那些给予逻辑重要地位的人所认识到。显然，他们在寻求理解的帮助时，不信任心智的自然和自发运动。但这种补救措施来得太晚，在日常生活的习惯已让心智被传闻和低劣教条所困扰，被完全空洞的幻觉所占据的时候，局势已经无可挽回。[21] 因此，逻辑的艺术采取的预防措施来得太晚，完全无法恢复局面；其效果更多的是固定错误，而非揭示真相。唯一的希望，通往健康之路，是重新开始整个心智的工作；并且从一开始就应该不断控制心智，而不是任其自由发展；工作应该（如果可以这样说）由机器来完成。如果人们在处理机械任务时只用赤手空拳，没有工具的帮助和力量，就像他们在处理智力任务时几乎只依赖赤裸的智力那样，他们真正能够移动和克服的事物将非常有限，无论他们的努力多么坚韧和团结。如果我们暂停片刻，以一个例子作为镜子，我们可以问这样一个问题：如果要移动一个特别重的方尖碑来装饰凯旋或类似的盛大展览，而人们只用赤手空拳去做，一个明智的观众不会认为这是彻头彻尾的疯狂吗？更何况，如果他们增加工人数量，以为那样就能成功，岂不是更加荒唐？他会不会说，如果他们进一步筛选，只留下年轻和强壮的人，排除了较弱的人，并期望以此实现他们的抱负，他们的疯狂程度不是更加严重了？如果连这样都不满足，他们决定求助于体育艺术，要求每个人都按照体育艺术的规则适当地涂油和按摩手、手臂和肌肉，他不会抗议他们所做的只不过是有系统和有方法的疯狂行为吗？然而，在处理智力任务时，人们被类似疯狂的冲动和同样无效的企图所驱动，当他们从许多头脑的合作、简单的才华和高智力中寄予厚望，甚至用逻辑（可以被视为一种体育艺术）来增强他们的智力时，尽管他们投入了大量努力和精力（从适当的角度看），他们实际上使用的只是赤裸的智力。显而易见的是，在任何重大的人类手工劳动中，如果没有工具和机器的帮助，无论个人的力量如何，也无法增强，所有人的力量也无法统一。

基于这些前提，我们得出了两个结论，我们希望人们注意这些，以免他们忽视或忽略。第一个是：通过一个幸运的机会（我们这样认为）倾向于偏离和消除自负和矛盾精神，我们可以实现我们的设计，而不损害或减少对古人应有的荣誉和敬意，同时还能收获我们谦逊的成果。因为如果我们坚持认为，在遵循他们的道路时我们比古人取得了更好的成果，我们将无法避免在智力能力或卓越性上进行比较或竞争。这本身可能不是错误的或没有先例的；为什么我们不能以自己的权利（这是每个人都有的权利）批评或谴责他们所观察或错误地假设的任何事物？然而，无论多么正当或合法，竞赛本身仍然会因为我们资源的限制而不平等。但由于我们的关注点是为智力开辟一条完全不同的道路，这条路未被古人所知或尝试，情况就完全不同了；党派和偏见不存在；我们的角色仅仅是作为引路者，这自然没有多大权威性，更多地取决于运气而非能力和卓越性。而这种评论是针对人的；下一条评论则是针对事物本身的。

我们无意推翻当前的哲学，或任何现在或将来可能更正确或更完整的哲学。我们也不打算阻止这种被普遍接受的哲学和其它类似的哲学继续促进辩论、美化话语，或在学术教学和民事生活手册中成功应用。实际上，我们坦率地承认并声明，我们引入的这种哲学对于上述目的将是完全无用的。它并不容易掌握，不能随意学习，它不迎合智力偏见，在其实用性和效果以外，它不会适应普通理解。

因此，让我们有两个学习的来源和两种传播的方式（愿这对他们俩都是好的和幸运的）。同样地，让思想家或哲学家分为两个氏族或家族；让他们不是相互敌对或疏远，而是通过相互帮助的纽带结成联盟。最重要的是，让培养科学有一种方法，发现它们有另一种方法。

对于那些更倾向于并更接受第一种方法的人，无论是因为他们的急切，还是因为民事生活的需求，或是因为他们缺乏掌握另一种方法的智力能力，我们祈愿他们的活动顺利，如他们所愿，并且实现他们的追求。但对于那些不仅仅满足于利用已被发现的知识，而是要进一步深入探索；不是为了在辩论中战胜对手，而是通过行动征服自然；不是为了对事物有美妙、似是而非的观点，而是要有确定、可证实的知识的人；让这些人（如果他们愿意的话），作为真正的科学之子，与我一起，以便我们可以越过自然的前厅，这是无数人踏过的地方，并最终打开通往内部房间的通道。为了更好的理解，并通过赋予名称使我们的意图更加清晰，我们选择称其中一种方式或方法为心智的预期（Anticipation of the Mind）[22]，另一种为自然的解释（Interpretation of Nature）。

我们还有一个必须提出的请求。我们经过深思熟虑，并努力确保我们的建议不仅真实，而且能够轻松顺畅地进入人们（他们的思维以各种方式被占据和阻碍）的心灵。但在这样一次学习和科学的更新中，我们合理地请求：任何想要评价或反思我们这些思想的人，无论是凭借自己的感觉、依靠众多权威，还是通过目前具有司法规则般权威的论证方式，都不应期望能够在做其他事情的同时偶然地做到这一点，而应该适当地了解这个主题；他应该亲自尝试一下我们正在设计和构建的道路；习惯于经验所启示的事物的微妙之处；最后，在合理的时间内纠正那些根深蒂固的不良心理习惯；然后，仅当他成熟并成为自己的主人后（如果他愿意的话），再运用自己的判断力。

## Further reading

The standard edition of Bacon's works is J. Spedding, R. L. Ellis and D. D.

Heath (eds.), Works ( vols., London, Longman et al., –). This

contains Latin and English original texts and English translations of the

major works. Spedding was concerned to separate from the works any

possible taint derived from Bacon's infamous reputation as a politician and

betrayer of friendship. He therefore allocated writings with any political or

personal content to a separate ‘Letters and Life', J. Spedding (ed.), Letters

and Life ( vols., London, Longman, Green, Longman & Roberts, –),

which he prefaced with a lengthy apologia designed to exonerate Bacon.

Many pieces in the Letters and Life belong more properly with the Works.

For a full understanding of Bacon's writings it is necessary to use the two

together. For English translations of additional minor works (the Temporis

partus masculus, Cogitata et visa and Redargutio philosophiarum) see B.

Farrington, The Philosophy of Francis Bacon: An Essay on Its Development

## The Great Renewal

The New Organon

These are

the thoughts of

Francis Verulam,

and this is the

he believed

method which he designed for himself:

that present and future generations

would be better oﬀ

if he made it known to them.

He became aware that the human intellect is the source of its own problems,

and makes no sensible and appropriate use of the very real aids which are

within man's power; the consequence is a deeply layered ignorance of

nature, and as a result of this ignorance, innumerable deprivations. He

therefore judged that he must make every eﬀort to ﬁnd a way by which the

relation between the mind and nature could be wholly restored or at least

considerably improved. But there was simply no hope that errors which

have grown powerful with age and which are likely to remain powerful for

ever would (if the mind were left to itself) correct themselves of their own

accord one by one, either from the native force of the understanding or with

the help and assistance of logic. The reason is that the ﬁrst notions of things

which the mind accepts, keeps and accumulates (and which are the source

of everything else), are faulty and confused and abstracted from things

without care; and in its secondary and other notions there is no less passion

and inconsistency. The consequence is that the general human reason

which we bring to bear on the inquiry into nature is not well founded and

properly constructed; it is like a magniﬁcent palace without a foundation.

Men admire and celebrate the false powers of the mind, but miss and lose

the real powers they could have (if the proper assistance were used and if

the mind itself were more compliant towards nature and did not recklessly

insult it). The only course remaining was to try the thing again from the

start with better means, and make a general Renewal of the sciences and

arts and of all human learning, beginning from correct foundations. This

might seem, on approach, to be something illimitably vast and beyond

mortal strength, and yet in the treatment, will be found to be sane and

sensible, more so than what has been done in the past. For one can see an

end to it. Whereas in what is currently done in the sciences, there is a kind

of giddiness, a perpetual agitation and going in a circle. He is also very


aware of the solitude in which this experiment moves, and how hard, how

unbelievably diﬃcult, it is to get people to believe in it. Nevertheless he felt

that he should not fail himself or abandon his subject without attempting

to travel the only road open to the human mind. For it is better to make a

beginning of a thing which has a chance of an end, than to get caught up in

things which have no end, in perpetual struggle and exertion. These ways

of thought are analogous in some way to the two legendary paths of action:

the one is steep and diﬃcult at the beginning but ends in the open; the

other, at ﬁrst glance easy and downhill, leads to impassable, precipitous

places.1 He could not be sure when such things would occur to anyone

again in the future; he was particularly moved by the argument that he had

not so far found anyone who had applied his mind to similar thoughts; and

therefore he decided to give to the public the ﬁrst parts that he had been

able to complete. His haste was not due to ambition but to anxiety; if in the

human way of things, anything should happen to him, there would still be

extant an outline and plan of the thing which he had conceived in his mind;

there would still exist also some indication of his genuine concern for the

good of the human race. Certainly he regarded every other ambition as

lower than the work that he had in hand. For either the matter in question

is nothing, or it is so important that it should rightly be content with itself

and not seek any external reward.

To our most serene

and powerful

Prince and Lord,

James

by the Grace of God

King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,

Defender of the Faith, etc.2

Most serene and powerful King,

Your Majesty may perhaps charge me with theft for stealing from your

aﬀairs the time I needed for this work. I have no answer. One cannot restore

time; unless perhaps the time which I took from your aﬀairs may redound

to the memory of your name and the honour of your age, if this work has

any value. It is certainly quite new; a totally new kind of thing; though

drawn from a very old model, namely the world itself, and the nature

of things and of the mind. Certainly I myself (I frankly confess) am

accustomed to regard this work as a birth of time rather than of intelligence.

The only wonder is that the beginning of the thing and such a powerful

suspicion of opinions so long prevalent could have entered anyone's mind.

The rest follows freely. But undoubtedly chance (as we say) and a certain

fortuitous element plays a role in what men think no less than in what they

do or say. By this chance of which I speak, I mean that if there is any good

in these things which I bring, it will be imputed to the immense mercy and

goodness of God and to the happiness of your times: as I have served you

in my life with the sincerest devotion, so after my death I may perhaps

ensure that your age will shine to posterity, by the lighting of this new torch

in the dark days of philosophy. And this Regeneration and Renewal of the

sciences is rightly due to the times of the wisest and most learned of all

kings. I would add a petition, not unworthy of your Majesty, and most

closely related to our present subject. It is that as you rival Solomon3 in so

many things, in gravity of judgement, in the peace of your kingdom, in the

largeness of your heart, and ﬁnally in the remarkable variety of books which

you have composed, you would emulate that same king in another way,

by taking steps to ensure that a Natural and Experimental History be

built up and completed: the true, strict history (without philological

questions) which is the path to the foundation of philosophy, and which we

shall describe in its place. So that at last, after so many ages of the world,

philosophy and the sciences may no longer ﬂoat in the air, but rest upon the

solid foundations of every kind of experience properly considered. I have

supplied the Instrument;4 but the material must be sought in things them-

selves. May the Great and Good God long preserve your Majesty from

The Great Renewal

Preface

On the state of the sciences, that it is neither prosperous nor far advanced;

and that a quite diﬀerent way must be opened up for the human

intellect than men have known in the past, and

new aids devised, so that

the mind may exercise

its right over nature.

Men seem to me to have no good sense of either their resources or their

power; but to exaggerate the former and underrate the latter. Hence, either

they put an insane value on the arts which they already have and look no

further or, undervaluing themselves, they waste their power on triﬂes and

fail to try it out on things which go to the heart of the matter. And so they

are like fatal pillars of Hercules5 to the sciences; for they are not stirred by

the desire or the hope of going further. Belief in abundance is among the

greatest causes of poverty; because of conﬁdence in the present, real aids

for the future are neglected. It is therefore not merely useful but quite

essential that at the very outset of our work (without hesitation or pretence)

we rid ourselves of this excess of veneration and regard, with a useful warn-

ing that men should not exaggerate or celebrate their abundance and its

usefulness. For if you look closely at the wide range of books which are

the boast of the arts and sciences, you will frequently ﬁnd innumerable

repetitions of the same thing, diﬀerent in manner of treatment but antici-

pated in content, so that things which at ﬁrst glance seem to be numerous

are found on examination to be few. One must also speak plainly about use-

fulness, and say that the wisdom which we have drawn in particular from

the Greeks seems to be a kind of childish stage of science, and to have

the child's characteristic of being all too ready to talk, but too weak and

immature to produce anything. For it is fertile in controversies, and feeble

in results. The story of Scylla seems to ﬁt the current state of letters exactly:

she showed the face and visage of a virgin, but barking monsters clothed

5 Columnae (pillars) seems to allude to the engraving on the title page of the edition of , and to

refer to the Pillars of Hercules, beyond which men had not dared to sail hitherto. Cf. Plato, Timaeus

Preface to ‘The Great Renewal'

and clung to her loins.6 Similarly, the sciences to which we are accustomed

have certain bland and specious generalities, but when we get to particulars

(which are like the generative parts), so that they may bring forth fruit and

works from themselves, disputes and scrappy controversies start up, and

that is where it ends and that is all the fruit they have to show. Besides, if

such sciences were not a completely dead thing, it seems very unlikely that

we would have the situation we have had for many centuries, that the

sciences are almost stopped in their tracks, and show no developments

worthy of the human race. Very often indeed not only does an assertion

remain a mere assertion but a question remains a mere question, not

resolved by discussion, but ﬁxed and augmented; and the whole tradition

of the disciplines presents us with a series of masters and pupils, not a

succession of discoverers and disciples who make notable improvements to

the discoveries. In the mechanical arts we see the opposite situation. They

grow and improve every day as if they breathed some vital breeze. In their

ﬁrst authors they usually appear crude, clumsy almost, and ungainly, but

later they acquire new powers and a kind of elegance, to the point that

men's desires and ambitions change and fail more swiftly than these arts

reach their peak of perfection. By contrast, philosophy and the intellectual

sciences are, like statues, admired and venerated but not improved.

Moreover they are sometimes at their best in their earliest author and then

decline. For after men have joined a sect and committed themselves (like

obsequious courtiers) to one man's opinion, they add no distinction to the

sciences themselves, but act like servants in courting and adorning their

authors. Let no one maintain that the sciences have grown little by little

and now have reached a certain condition, and now at last (like runners who

have ﬁnished the race) have found their ﬁnal homes in the works of a few

authors, and now that nothing better can be discovered, it remains only to

adorn and cultivate what has already been discovered. We could wish that

it were so. But a more correct and truthful account of the matter is that

these appropriations of the sciences7 are simply a result of the conﬁdence

of a few men and the idleness and inertia of the rest. For after the sciences

had been perhaps carefully cultivated and developed in some areas, by

chance there arose a person, daring in character, who was accepted and

followed because he had a summary kind of method; in appearance he

gave the art a form, but in reality he corrupted the labours of the older

6 For this portrait of Scylla see Ovid, Metamorphoses, .–.

investigators. Yet it is a delight to posterity, because of the handy useful-

ness of his work and their disgust and impatience with new inquiry. And if

anyone is attracted by ancient consensus and the judgement of time (so to

speak), he should realise that he is relying on a very deceptive and feeble

method. For we are mostly ignorant of what has become known and been

published in the sciences and arts in diﬀerent centuries and other places,

and much more ignorant of what has been tried by individuals and dis-

cussed in private. So neither the births nor the abortions of time are extant

in the public record. Nor should we attach much value to consensus itself

and its longevity. There may be many kinds of political state, but there is

only one state of the sciences, and it is a popular state and always will be.

And among the people the kinds of learning which are most popular are

those which are either controversial and combative or attractive and empty,

that is, those which ensnare and those which seduce assent. This is surely

why the greatest geniuses in every age have suﬀered violence; while men of

uncommon intellect and understanding, simply to preserve their reputa-

tion, have submitted themselves to the judgement of time and the multi-

tude. For this reason, if profound thoughts have occasionally ﬂared up, they

have soon been blown on by the winds of common opinion and put out.

The result is that Time like a river has brought down to us the light things

that ﬂoat on the surface, and has sunk what is weighty and solid. Even those

authors who have assumed a kind of dictatorship in the sciences and make

pronouncements about things with so much conﬁdence, take to complain-

ing when they recover their senses from time to time about the subtlety of

nature, the depths of truth, the obscurity of things, the complexity of

causes, and the weakness of human understanding; yet they are no more

modest in this, since they prefer to blame the common condition of man

and nature rather than admit their own incapacity. In fact their usual habit,

when some art fails to deliver something, is to declare the thing impossible

on the basis of the same art. An art cannot be condemned when it is itself

both the advocate and the judge; and so the issue is to save ignorance from

disgrace. This then, more or less, is the condition of the traditional and

received kinds of learning: barren of results, full of questions; slow and

feeble in improvement; claiming perfection in the whole, but very imperfect

in the parts; popular in choice and suspect to the authors themselves, and

therefore wrapped up and presented with a variety of devices. Even those

who have set out to learn for themselves and to commit themselves to the

sciences and extend their limits, have not dared to abandon the received



Preface to ‘The Great Renewal'

sciences completely or to seek the sources of things. They think they have

achieved something important if they insert and add something of their

own, prudently reﬂecting that in assenting they preserve their modesty and

in adding they keep their freedom. But in being respectful of opinions and

habits, these middle ways that people praise result in great losses for the

sciences. For you can hardly admire an author and at the same time go

beyond him. It is like water; it ascends no higher than its starting point.

And so such men make some emendations but little progress; they improve

existing learning but do not progress to anything new. There have also been

men who with greater daring have thought that everything was new with

them, and have relied on the strength of their genius to ﬂatten and destroy

everything that went before, and so made room for themselves and their

opinions. They have not achieved much for all their noise; for what they

tried to do was not to augment philosophy and the arts in fact and eﬀect,

but only to cause a change in belief and transfer the leadership of opinion

to themselves; with very little proﬁt, since among opposite errors, the

causes of erring are almost the same. Those who have had suﬃcient spirit

to want other men to join their inquiries, because they were not enslaved to

their own or to other people's dogmas but favoured freedom, have doubt-

less been honest in intention, but they have been ineﬀective in practice. For

they seem to have followed only probable reasoning, and are carried round

and round in a whirlpool of arguments, and take all the power out of their

investigation by their undisciplined licence in raising questions. There has

been no one who has spent an adequate amount of time on things them-

selves and on experience. And some again who have committed themselves

to the waves of experience, making themselves almost mechanics, still

practise a kind of aimless investigation in experience itself, since even they

do not work by ﬁxed rules. In fact most of them have set themselves some

petty tasks, thinking it a great achievement to make a single discovery;

a design as inept as it is modest. It is impossible to make a thorough and

successful inquiry into the nature of a thing in the thing itself; after a

tedious variety of experiments he ﬁnds no end but only further lines of

investigation. Then again, one should particularly notice that every eﬀort

expended on experience right from the beginning has sought to obtain

certain speciﬁc results and to get them fast and directly; it has sought

(I repeat) proﬁtable, not illuminating, experiments; failing to imitate God's

order, who on the ﬁrst day created only light, and devoted a whole day to

it; and produced on that day no material eﬀects, moving on to these only



The New Organon

on subsequent days. But those who have assigned the highest functions

to logic and have thought to fashion the most powerful assistants to the

sciences out of logic, have well and truly seen that the unaided human

understanding really has to be distrusted. However, the medicine is much

worse than the disease; and not without its own problems. For the logic

now in use, though very properly applied to civil questions and the

arts which consist of discussion and opinion, still falls a long way short of

the subtlety of nature; and in grasping at what it cannot hold, has

succeeded in establishing and ﬁxing errors rather than in opening up the

way to truth.

And so, to summarise what I have said, neither a man's own eﬀorts nor

his trust in another's seems so far to have worked for men in the sciences;

especially as there is little help to be got from the demonstrations and

experiments so far known. The fabric of the universe, its structure, to the

mind observing it, is like a labyrinth, where on all sides the path is so often

uncertain, the resemblance of a thing or a sign is deceptive, and the twists

and turns of natures are so oblique and intricate. One must travel always

through the forests of experience and particular things, in the uncertain

light of the senses, which is sometimes shining and sometimes hidden.

Moreover those who oﬀer to guide one on the way are also lost in the

labyrinth and simply add to the number who have gone astray. In such

diﬃcult circumstances, one cannot count on the unaided power of men's

judgement; one cannot count on succeeding by chance. Even supreme

intelligence or unlimited throws of the dice could not overcome the

diﬃculties. We need a thread to guide our steps; and the whole road, right

from the ﬁrst perceptions of sense, has to be made with a sure method. This

should not be taken to imply that nothing at all has been achieved in so many

centuries, with so much eﬀort. Nor do we complain of the discoveries that

have been made. Certainly in the things that were within the range of their

intelligence and abstract thinking, the ancients acquitted themselves

admirably. But just as in previous centuries when men set their course

in sailing simply by observations of the stars, they were certainly able to

follow the shores of the old continent and cross some relatively small inland

seas, but before the ocean could be crossed and the territories of the new

world revealed, it was necessary to have a knowledge of the nautical com-

pass as a more reliable and certain guide. By the same reasoning exactly, the

discoveries that have so far been made in the arts and sciences are of the

kind that could be found out by use, thought, observation and argument,



Preface to ‘The Great Renewal'

in that they are closely connected with the senses and common notions; but

before one can sail to the more remote and secret places of nature, it

is absolutely essential to introduce a better and more perfect use and

application of the mind and understanding.

For ourselves, swayed by the eternal love of truth, we have committed

ourselves to uncertain, rough and solitary ways, and relying and resting

on God's help, we have fortiﬁed our mind against violent attacks from

the armed forces of opinion, and against our own internal hesitations and

scruples, the dark mists and clouds and fantasies of things ﬂying all around

us; so that at the end we may be able to provide more reliable and secure

directions8 for present and future generations. If we have had any success

in this, the method that opened the way for us was certainly a true and

proper humiliation of the human spirit. For all those before us who have

devoted themselves to the discovery of arts have simply cast a brief glance

at things and examples and experience, and then called on their own

spirits to give them oracles, as if discovery were no more than conjuring up

a new idea. But we stay faithfully and constantly with things, and abstract

our minds no further from them than is necessary for the images and rays

of things to come into focus (as in the case of sight), and therefore little is

left to the power and excellence of the intelligence. And as we use humility

in discovery, we have followed it also in teaching. And we do not attempt

to claim or impose a spurious dignity on our discoveries either by triumphs

in refutation or by appeals to antiquity or by any usurpation of authority

or even by taking refuge in obscurity; it would not be diﬃcult to do this

kind of thing if one were trying to glorify his own name rather than

enlighten the minds of others. We have not planned (I say) or laid any attack

or ambush for men's judgements; we bring them into the presence of things

themselves and their connections, so that they may see what they have,

what they may question, and what they may add and contribute to the

common stock. If we have too readily believed anything, if we have fallen

asleep or not paid enough attention, or given up on the way and stopped

the inquiry too soon, we still present things plainly and clearly. Hence our

mistakes may be noted and removed before they infect the body of science

too deeply; and anyone else may easily and readily take over our labours.

In this way we believe that we have made for ever a true and lawful

interpretatione naturae, i.e. ‘The New Instrument, or True Directions for the Interpretation of

Nature'.



The New Organon

marriage between the empirical and the rational faculties (whose sad and

unhappy divorce and separation have caused all the trouble in the human

family).

And therefore, since these things are not under our control, at the out-

set of our work we oﬀer the most humble and fervent prayers to God the

Father, God the Word and God the Spirit, that mindful of the aﬄictions of

mankind and of the pilgrimage of life in which we pass few days and evil,

they may deign to endow the human family through our hands with new

mercies. We also humbly pray that the human may not overshadow the

divine, and that from the revelation of the ways of sense and the brighter

burning of the natural light, the darkness of unbelief in the face of the

mysteries of God may not arise in our hearts. Rather we pray that from a

clear understanding, purged of fantasy and vanity, yet subject still to the

oracles of God and wholly committed to them, we may give to faith all that

belongs to faith. And ﬁnally we pray that when we have extracted from

knowledge the poison infused by the serpent which swells and inﬂates the

human mind, we may not be wise with too high or too great a wisdom, but

may cultivate the truth in all charity.

Our prayers done, we turn to men and oﬀer some salutary advice and

make some reasonable requests. First we advise (as we have prayed) that

men may restrain their sense within their duty, so far as the things of God

are concerned. For sense (like the sun) opens up the face of the terrestrial

globe and closes and obscures the globe of heaven. And then we warn

men not to err in the opposite direction as they avoid this evil; which will

certainly happen if they believe that any part of the inquiry into nature is

forbidden by an interdict. The pure and immaculate natural knowledge

by which Adam assigned appropriate names to things did not give oppor-

tunity or occasion for the Fall. The method and mode of temptation in fact

was the ambitious and demanding desire for moral knowledge, by which to

discriminate good from evil, to the end that Man might turn away from

God and give laws to himself. About the sciences which observe nature the

sacred philosopher declares that ‘the Glory of God is to conceal a thing, but

the glory of a king is to ﬁnd out a thing',9 just as if the divine nature

delighted in the innocent and amusing children's game in which they hide

themselves purposely in order to be found; and has coopted the human

mind to join this game in his kindness and goodness towards men. Finally,

9 Proverbs :; the phrase is quoted again at New Organon, ., in a slightly diﬀerent form.



Preface to ‘The Great Renewal'

we want all and everyone to be advised to reﬂect on the true ends of knowl-

edge:10 not to seek it for amusement or for dispute, or to look down on

others, or for proﬁt or for fame or for power or any such inferior ends, but

for the uses and beneﬁts of life, and to improve and conduct it in charity.

For the angels fell because of an appetite for power; and men fell because

of an appetite for knowledge; but charity knows no bounds; and has never

brought angel or man into danger.

The requests we make are as follows. Nothing for ourselves personally,

but about what we are doing, we ask that men think of it not as an opinion

but as a work, and hold it for certain that we are laying the foundations not

of a sect or of a dogma, but of human progress and empowerment. And

then that they would give their own real interests a chance, and put oﬀ the

zeal and prejudice of beliefs and think of the common good; then, freed

from obstacles and mistaken notions of the way, and equipped with our

helps and assistance, we would ask them to undertake their share of the

labours that remain. And we ask them to be of good hope; and not imagine

or conceive of our Renewal as something inﬁnite and superhuman, when

in fact it is the end of unending error, and the right goal, and accepts the

limitations of mortality and humanity, since it does not expect that the

thing can be completely ﬁnished in the course of one lifetime, but provides

for successors; and ﬁnally that it seeks knowledge not (arrogantly) in the

tiny cells of human intelligence but humbly in the wider world. For the

most part empty things are very big, solid things are very dense and take

up little space. Finally, it seems, we must also request (just in case anyone

means to be unfair to us, which would imperil the project itself) that men

determine how far, on the basis of what we are compelled to say (if we are

to be consistent), they may believe they have the right to have an opinion

or to express a view about our teachings; for we reject (in an inquiry into

nature) all that hasty human reasoning, based on preconceptions,11 which

abstracts from things carelessly and more quickly than it should, as a vague,

unstable procedure, badly devised. And I cannot be arraigned to stand trial

under a procedure which is itself on trial.

## The plan of the work

It consists of six Parts:

First, The Divisions of the Sciences.

Second, The New Organon, or Directions for the Interpretation of Nature.

Third, Phenomena of the Universe, or A Natural and Experimental History

towards the foundation of Philosophy.

Fourth, The Ladder of the Intellect.

Fifth, Forerunners, or Anticipations of Second Philosophy.

Sixth, Second Philosophy, or Practical Science.

### The outlines of each Part

It is a part of our plan to set everything out as openly and clearly as possible.

For a naked mind is the companion of innocence and simplicity, as once

upon a time the naked body was. And therefore we must ﬁrst lay out the

order and plan of our work. It consists of six parts.

The ﬁrst part gives a Summary or general description of the science or

learning which the human race currently possesses. It seemed good to us

to spend some time on what is presently accepted, thinking that this would

help the perfection of the old and the approach to the new. We are almost

equally eager to develop the old and to acquire the new. This also gives us

credibility, according to the saying that ‘an ignorant man will not believe

words of knowledge until you have told him what he has in his heart'.

Hence we shall not neglect to sail along the shores of the accepted sciences

and arts, importing some useful items into them, in our passage.

However the divisions of the sciences which we employ include not only



Plan of ‘The Great Renewal'

things which have been noticed and discovered but also things that until

now have been missed but should be there. For in the intellectual as in the

physical world, there are deserts as well as cultivated places. And so it is

not surprising if we sometimes depart from the customary divisions. An

addition not only changes the whole, but necessarily also alters the parts

and sections; and the accepted divisions merely reﬂect the currently

accepted outline of the sciences.

In matters which we shall note as missing, we shall be sure to do more

than simply suggest a bare title and an outline account of what is needed.

For if we report among things missing anything (of some value) whose

method seems so obscure that we are justiﬁed in suspecting that men will

not easily understand what we mean, or what is the task which we imagine

and conceive in our mind, we will always take the trouble either to add

instructions for carrying out the task or a report of our own performance

of a part of it, as an example of the whole; so that we may give some help in

each case either by advice or in practice. We feel that our own reputation,

as well as the interest of others, requires that no one should suppose that

some superﬁcial notions on these matters have simply entered in our heads,

and that the things we desiderate and try to grasp are mere wishes. They

are such that they are clearly within men's power (unless men fail them-

selves), and I do have a ﬁrm and explicit conception of them. I have under-

taken not merely to survey these regions in my mind, like an augur taking

the auspices, but to enter them like a general, with a strong will to claim

possession. And this is the ﬁrst part of the work.

After coasting by the ancient arts, we will next equip the human under-

standing to set out on the ocean. We plan therefore, for our second part, an

account of a better and more perfect use of reason in the investigation of

things and of the true aids of the intellect, so that (despite our humanity

and subjection to death) the understanding may be raised and enlarged in

its ability to overcome the diﬃcult and dark things of nature. And the art

which we apply (which we have chosen to call Interpretation of Nature ) is

an art of logic, though with a great diﬀerence, indeed a vast diﬀerence. It is

true that ordinary logic also claims to devise and prepare assistants and

supports for the intellect; in this they are the same. But it diﬀers altogether

from ordinary logic in three particular ways: viz., in its end, in its order of

demonstration, and in the starting points of its inquiry.

For the end we propose for our science is the discovery of arts, not of



arguments, of principles and not of inferences from principles, of signs

and indications of works and not probable reasonings. Diﬀerent results

follow from our diﬀerent design. They defeat and conquer their adversary

by disputation; we conquer nature12 by work.

The nature and order of our demonstrations agree with such an end. For

in ordinary logic almost all eﬀort is concentrated on the syllogism. The

logicians seem scarcely to have thought about induction. They pass it by

with barely a mention, and hurry on to their formulae for disputation. But

we reject proof by syllogism, because it operates in confusion and lets

nature slip out of our hands. For although no one could doubt that things

which agree in a middle term, agree also with each other (which has a kind

of mathematical certainty), nevertheless there is a kind of underlying fraud

here, in that a syllogism consists of propositions, and propositions consist

of words, and words are counters and signs of notions. And therefore if the

very notions of the mind (which are like the soul of words, and the basis of

every such structure and fabric) are badly or carelessly abstracted from

things, and are vague and not deﬁned with suﬃciently clear outlines, and

thus deﬁcient in many ways, everything falls to pieces. And therefore we

reject the syllogism; and not only so far as principles are concerned (they

do not use it for that either) but also for intermediate propositions, which

the syllogism admittedly deduces and generates in a certain fashion, but

without eﬀects, quite divorced from practice and completely irrelevant to

the active part of the sciences. For even if we leave to the syllogism and

similar celebrated but notorious kinds of demonstration jurisdiction over

the popular arts which are based on opinion (for we have no ambitions in

this area), still for the nature of things we use induction throughout, and

as much for the minor propositions as for the major ones. For we regard

induction as the form of demonstration which respects the senses, stays

close to nature, fosters results and is almost involved in them itself.

And so the order of demonstration also is completely reversed. For the

way the thing has normally been done until now is to leap immediately

from sense and particulars to the most general propositions, as to ﬁxed

poles around which disputations may revolve; then to derive everything

else from them by means of intermediate propositions; which is certainly

tion presupposes. (See The Novum Organum; or, A True Guide to the Interpretation of Nature, by



Plan of ‘The Great Renewal'

a short route, but dangerously steep, inaccessible to nature and inherently

prone to disputations. By contrast, by our method, axioms are gradually

elicited step by step, so that we reach the most general axioms only at the

very end; and the most general axioms come out not as notional, but as well

deﬁned, and such as nature acknowledges as truly known to her, and which

live in the heart of things.

By far the biggest question we raise is as to the actual form of induction,

and of the judgement made on the basis of induction. For the form of

induction which the logicians speak of, which proceeds by simple

enumeration, is a childish thing, which jumps to conclusions, is exposed to

the danger of instant contradiction, observes only familiar things and

reaches no result.

What the sciences need is a form of induction which takes experience

apart and analyses it, and forms necessary conclusions on the basis of

appropriate exclusions and rejections. And if the logicians' usual form of

judgement has been so diﬃcult and required so much intellectual exertion,

how much more eﬀort should we expend on this other judgement, which

is drawn not only from the depths of the mind but from the bowels of

nature.

And this is not all. For we place the foundations of the sciences deeper

and lay them lower, and set our starting points further back than men have

ever done before, subjecting them to examination, while ordinary logic

accepts them on the basis of others' belief. For logicians borrow (if I may

put it this way) the principles of the sciences from the particular sciences

themselves; then they pay respect to the ﬁrst notions of the mind; ﬁnally

they are happy with the immediate perceptions of healthy senses. But

our position is that true logic should enter the provinces of the individual

sciences with greater authority than is in their own principles, and compel

those supposed principles themselves to give an account as to what extent

they are ﬁrmly established. As for the ﬁrst notions of the intellect: not one

of the things which the intellect has accumulated by itself escapes our

suspicion, and we do not conﬁrm them without submitting them to a new

trial and a verdict given in accordance with it. Furthermore, we have many

ways of scrutinising the information of the senses themselves. For the

senses often deceive, but they also give evidence of their own errors; how-

ever the errors are to hand, the evidence is far to seek.

The senses are defective in two ways: they may fail us altogether or

they may deceive. First, there are many things which escape the senses



The New Organon

even when they are healthy and quite unimpeded; either because of the

rarity of the whole body or by the extremely small size of its parts, or by

distance, or by its slowness or speed, or because the object is too familiar,

or for other reasons. And even when the senses do grasp an object, their

apprehensions of it are not always reliable. For the evidence and informa-

tion given by the senses is always based on the analogy of man not of the

universe; it is a very great error to assert that the senses are the measure of

things.

So to meet these defects, we have sought and gathered from every side,

with great and faithful devotion, assistants to the senses, so as to provide

substitutes in the case of total failure and correction in the case of dis-

tortion. We do this not so much with instruments as with experiments.

For the subtlety of experiments is far greater than that of the senses them-

selves even when assisted by carefully designed instruments; we speak of

experiments which have been devised and applied speciﬁcally for the

question under investigation with skill and good technique. And therefore

we do not rely very much on the immediate and proper perception of the

senses, but we bring the matter to the point that the senses judge only of

the experiment, the experiment judges of the thing. Hence we believe that

we have made the senses (from which, if we prefer not to be insane we must

derive everything in natural things) sacred high priests of nature and

skilled interpreters of its oracles; while others merely seem to respect and

honour the senses, we do so in actual fact. Such are the preparations which

we make for the light of nature and its kindling and application; and they

would be suﬃcient in themselves if men's understandings were unbiased,

a blank slate. But as men's minds have been occupied in so many strange

ways that they have no even, polished surface available to receive the true

rays of things, it is essential for us to realise that we need to ﬁnd a remedy

for this too.

The Idols13 by which the mind is occupied are either artiﬁcial or innate.

The artiﬁcial idols have entered men's minds either from the doctrines and

sects of philosophers or from perverse rules of proof. The innate idols are

inherent in the nature of the intellect itself, which is found to be much more

prone to error than the senses. For however much men may ﬂatter them-

selves and run into admiration and almost veneration of the human mind,

13 ‘Idols' is the usual translation of Bacon's famous idola. We too have used it on most occasions, but

the meaning of some passages seemed to be better conveyed by the translation ‘illusion'. See also

.n.



Plan of ‘The Great Renewal'

it is quite certain that, just as an uneven mirror alters the rays of things

from their proper shape and ﬁgure, so also the mind, when it is aﬀected by

things through the senses, does not faithfully preserve them, but inserts

and mingles its own nature with the nature of things as it forms and devises

its own notions.

The ﬁrst two kinds of idols can be eliminated, with some diﬃculty, but

the last in no way. The only strategy remaining is, on the one hand, to indict

them, and to expose and condemn the mind's insidious force, in case after

the destruction of the old, new shoots of error should grow and multiply

from the poor structure of the mind itself, and the result would be that

errors would not be quashed but simply altered; and on the other hand, to

ﬁx and establish for ever the truth that the intellect can make no judgement

except by induction in its legitimate form. Hence the teaching which

cleanses the mind to make it receptive to truth consists of three refutations:

a refutation of philosophies; a refutation of proofs; and a refutation of

natural human reason. When we have dealt with these, and clariﬁed the

part played by the nature of things and the part played by the nature of the

mind, we believe that, with the help of God's goodness, we will have

furnished and adorned the bedchamber for the marriage of the mind and

the universe. In the wedding hymn we should pray that men may see born

from this union the assistants that they need and a lineage of discoveries

which may in some part conquer and subdue the misery and poverty of

man. And this is the second part of the work.

But we plan not only to show the way and build the roads, but also to enter

upon them. And therefore the third part of our work deals with the

Phenomena of the Universe, that is, every kind of experience, and the sort

of natural history which can establish the foundations of philosophy.

A superior method of proof or form of interpreting nature may defend and

protect the mind from error and mistake, but it cannot supply or provide

material for knowledge. But those who are determined not to guess and

take omens but to discover and know, and not to make up fairytales and

stories about worlds, but to inspect and analyse the nature of this real

world, must seek everything from things themselves. No substitute or

alternative in the way of intelligence, thought or argument can take the

place of hard work and investigation and the visitation of the world, not

even if all the genius of all the world worked together. This then we must

unfailingly do or abandon the business for ever. But to this very day men



The New Organon

have acted so foolishly that it is no wonder that nature does not give them

access to her.

For in the ﬁrst place, the information of the senses themselves is defec-

tive and deceiving; observation is lazy, uneven and casual; teaching is

empty and based on hearsay; practice is slavishly bent on results; experi-

mental initiative is blind, unintelligent, hasty and erratic; and natural

history is shallow and superﬁcial. Between them they have accumulated

very poor material for the intellect to construct philosophy and the

sciences.

And the tendency to introduce subtle and intricate disputation prema-

turely comes too late to remedy a situation which is utterly desperate, and

does nothing to move on the enterprise or remove error. Thus there is no

hope of major development or progress except in a renewal of the sciences.

Its beginnings must come from a natural history, and a natural history

of a new kind with a new organisation. It would be pointless to polish the

mirror if there were no images; and clearly we must get suitable material

for the intellect, as well as making reliable instruments. And our history

(like our logic) diﬀers from that now in use in many ways: in its purpose or

task, in its actual extent and composition, in its subtlety, and also in the

selection and arrangement of it in relation to the next stage.

First we propose a natural history which does not so much amuse by

the variety of its contents or give immediate proﬁt from its experiments,

as shed light on the discovery of causes and provide a ﬁrst breast to feed

philosophy. For although our ultimate aim is works and the active part of

science, still we wait for harvest time and do not try to reap moss and the

crop while it is still green. We know very well that axioms properly dis-

covered bring whole companies of works with them, revealing them not

singly but in quantity. But we utterly condemn and reject the childish

desire to take some pledges prematurely, in the form of new works, like an

apple of Atalanta which slows the race.14 Such is the task of our Natural

History.

And as for its composition, we are making a history not only of nature

free and unconstrained (when nature goes its own way and does its own

work), such as a history of the bodies of heaven and the sky, of land and sea,

of minerals, plants and animals; but much more of nature conﬁned and

harassed, when it is forced from its own condition by art and human

14 This was one of the golden balls (or apples) which Milanion threw in front of Atalanta while he was

racing her, so that he could win the race and her hand in marriage.



Plan of ‘The Great Renewal'

agency, and pressured and moulded. And therefore we give a full descrip-

tion of all the experiments of the mechanical arts, all the experiments of the

applied part of the liberal arts, and all the experiments of several practical

arts which have not yet formed a speciﬁc art of their own (so far as we have

had an opportunity to investigate and they are relevant to our purpose).

Moreover (to be plain) we put much more eﬀort and many more resources

into this part than into the other, and pay no attention to men's disgust or

what they ﬁnd attractive, since nature reveals herself more through the

harassment of art than in her own proper freedom.

And we do not give a history of bodies only; we felt that we should also

take the trouble to make a separate history of the powers themselves (we

mean those which could be considered as central powers in nature, and

which plainly constitute the originals of nature, since they are the material

for the ﬁrst passions and desires, viz., Dense, Rare, Hot, Cold, Solid, Liquid,

Heavy, Light and many others).

As for subtlety, we are certainly looking for a kind of experience which

is far more subtle and simple than those which simply happen. For we

bring and draw many things out of obscurity which no one would ever have

thought to investigate if he were not following the sure and steady path to

the discovery of causes. For in themselves they are of no great use, so that

it is quite clear that they have not been sought for themselves. Rather they

are to things and works exactly like the letters of the alphabet to speech

and words: though useless in themselves, they are still the elements of all

discourse.

And in the choice of narratives and experiences we think that we have

served men better than those who have dealt with natural history in the

past. For we use the evidence of our own eyes, or at least of our own

perception, in everything, and apply the strictest criteria in accepting

things; so that we exaggerate nothing in our reports for the sake of sensa-

tion, and our narrations are free and untouched by fable and foolishness.

We also speciﬁcally proscribe and condemn many widely accepted false-

hoods (which have prevailed for many centuries by a kind of neglect and

are deeply ingrained), so that they may not trouble the sciences any more.

For as someone wisely remarked that the stories and superstitions and

triﬂes which nurses instil into children also seriously deprave their minds,15

by the same reasoning we feel we must be careful, and even anxious, that

15 Perhaps a reference to Plato, Republic , 8, Laws ﬀ, and elsewhere.



The New Organon

philosophy should not at the start get into the habit of any kind of foolish-

ness as we foster and nurture its infancy in the form of natural history. In

every experiment which is new and even the least bit subtle, even if (as it

seems to us) it is sure and proven, we give a frank account of the method of

the experiment we used; so that after we have revealed every move we

made, men may see any hidden error attached to it, and may be prompted

to ﬁnd more reliable, more meticulous proofs (if any exist); and ﬁnally we

sprinkle warnings, reservations and cautions in all directions, with the

religious scruple of an exorcist casting out and banishing every kind of

fantasy.

Finally, since we have seen how much experience and history distort the

sight of the human mind, and how diﬃcult it is (especially for tender or

prejudiced minds) at ﬁrst to get used to nature, we often add our own

observations, which are like the ﬁrst turn or move of history towards

philosophy (perhaps one might say, the ﬁrst glance). They are intended to

be like a pledge to men that they will not be forever ﬂoundering in the

waves of history, and that when we come to the work of the understanding,

everything will be more ready for action. By such a Natural History (as we

have outlined) we believe that men may make a safe, convenient approach

to nature and supply good, prepared material to the understanding.

After16 we have surrounded the intellect with the most trustworthy aides

and bodyguards, and have used the most stringent selection to build a ﬁne

army of divine works, it may seem that nothing remains to be done but to

approach philosophy itself. But in such a diﬃcult and doubtful task there

are certain points which it seems necessary to introduce ﬁrst, partly for

instruction and partly for their immediate usefulness.

The ﬁrst point is to give examples of investigation and discovery by our

way and method, as exhibited in certain subjects. We particularly choose

subjects which are both the most notable of things under investigation and

the most diﬀerent from each other; so that in every genus we may have an

example. We are not speaking of examples added to individual precepts and

rules for illustration (these we have given in abundance in our second part);

we simply mean types and variations, which may bring before our eyes the

whole procedure of the mind and the seamless fabric and order of its

discovery of things, in certain subjects, which will be diverse and striking.

16 This is the beginning of the fourth part.



Plan of ‘The Great Renewal'

The analogy that suggests itself is that in mathematics demonstration is

easy and clear when the machine is used, whereas without this convenience

everything seems complicated and more subtle than it really is. And so we

devote the fourth part of our work to such examples, and thus it is truly and

simply a particular and detailed application of the second part.

The ﬁfth part is useful only for a time until the rest is completed; and is

given as a kind of interest until we can get the capital. We are not driving

blindly towards our goal and ignoring the useful things that come up on the

way. For this reason the ﬁfth part of our work consists of things which we

have either discovered, demonstrated or added, not on the basis of our

methods and instructions for interpretation, but from the same intellectual

habits as other people generally employ in investigation and discovery. For

while we expect, from our constant converse with nature, greater things

from our reﬂections than our intellectual capacity might suggest, these

temporary results may in the meantime serve as shelters built along the

road for the mind to rest in for a while as it presses on towards more

certain things. However, we insist in the meantime that we do not wish to

be held to these results themselves, because they have not been discovered

or demonstrated by the true form of interpretation. One should not be

frightened of such a suspension of judgement in a doctrine which does not

assert simply that nothing can be known, but that nothing can be known

except in a certain order and by a certain method; and meanwhile it has set

up some degrees of certitude for use and comfort until the mind reaches

its goal of explanation of causes. Nor were the schools of philosophers

who simply maintained lack of conviction17 inferior to those who claimed

a freedom to make pronouncements. Yet the former did not provide

assistance to the sense and understanding, as we have done, but totally

undermined belief and authority; which is a very diﬀerent thing and almost

the opposite.

[] Finally the sixth part of our work (which the rest supports and serves)

at last reveals and expounds the philosophy which is derived and formed

from the kind of correct, pure, strict inquiry which we have already framed

and explained. It is beyond our ability and beyond our expectation to

achieve this ﬁnal part and bring it to completion. We have made a start on

17 Bacon uses the Greek word acatalepsia, the mark of the ancient Sceptics. See ..



The New Organon

the task, a start which we hope is not despicable; the end will come from

the fortune of mankind, such an end perhaps as in the present condition of

things and the present state of thought men cannot easily grasp or guess.

It is not merely success in speculation which is in question, but the human

situation, human fortune and the whole potential of works. For man is

nature's agent and interpreter; he does and understands only as much as

he has observed of the order of Nature in work or by inference; he does not

know and cannot do more.18 No strength exists that can interrupt or break

the chain of causes; and nature is conquered only by obedience. Therefore

those two goals of man, knowledge and power, a pair of twins, are really come

to the same thing, and works are chieﬂy frustrated by ignorance of causes.

The whole secret is never to let the mind's eyes stray from things them-

selves, and to take in images exactly as they are. May God never allow us

to publish a dream of our imagination as a model of the world, but rather

graciously grant us the power to describe the true appearance and revela-

tion of the prints and traces of the Creator in his creatures.

And therefore, Father, you who have given visible light as the ﬁrst fruits

of creation and, at the summit of your works, have breathed intellectual

light into the face of man, protect and govern this work, which began in

your goodness and returns to your glory. After you had turned to view the

works which your hands had made, you saw that all things were very good,

and you rested. But man, turning to the works which his hands have made,

saw that all things were vanity and vexation of spirit,19 and has had no rest.

Wherefore if we labour in your works, you will make us to share in your

vision and in your sabbath. We humbly beseech that this mind may remain

in us; and that you may be pleased to bless the human family with new mer-

cies, through our hands and the hands of those others to whom you will

give the same mind.

## Outline of a Natural and Experimental History

Outline of a Natural and Experimental History,

adequate to serve as

the basis and foundation of

True Philosophy

The reason why we are publishing our Renewal in parts is that some of it may

be put out of danger. For the same reason we are prompted to append a small

section of the work at this point and to publish it with what we have com-

pleted above. This is the outline and sketch of a Natural and Experimental

History such as is appropriate for grounding a philosophy; it contains an

abundance of good material, which is digested for the work of the interpreter

which follows it. The proper place for this would be when we duly reached

the Preparations of Investigation. But we think it advisable to anticipate, and

not wait for the proper place; because the kind of history we have in mind

and are about to describe is a massive thing which would take great pains and

expense to complete; it requires the eﬀorts of many men, and as we have said

before, is in some sense a royal task. It occurs to me therefore that it would

be appropriate to see whether there may be others able to take up this

challenge, so that while we complete the whole work according to plan, this

complex and time-consuming part may be built and made available (if it shall

please the divine majesty) even in our lifetime, by the cooperation of others

working steadily along with us, especially as our own resources without help

would hardly be adequate for such a great province. We shall perhaps

succeed in completing by our own eﬀorts the part which relates to the actual

work of the understanding. But the materials for the understanding are so

widely scattered that we need to have agents and merchants (so to speak)

seeking and collecting them from every corner. And in fact it is rather below

the dignity of our enterprise to waste our own time on such a thing as any

industrious person may do. We will now present the main point of the

matter ourselves, and give a careful and exact account of the method and out-

line of a such a history as will be adequate to our design, so that men may be

instructed, and not continue to be guided by the example of the currently

available natural histories, and stray far from our design. Meanwhile we

should stress here what we have often said elsewhere, that if the whole human

race had dedicated itself and its eﬀorts to philosophy, and the whole earth

had been, or should become, absolutely ﬁlled with universities and colleges

and schools of learned men, they could not have made, and cannot make, any

progress in philosophy and the sciences worthy of the human race without

such a Natural and Experimental History as we shall now prescribe. On the

other hand, when such a history has been developed and built up well, with

the ancillary and illuminating experiments which will occur or will have to

be devised in the actual process of interpretation, the investigation of nature

and the sciences will be the work of a few years. This is what has to be done,

or the enterprise abandoned. It is the one and only method by which a true

and practical philosophy can be established; and men will then perceive, as

if awakening from a deep sleep, what is the diﬀerence between the opinions

and ﬁctions of the mind and a true and practical philosophy, and just what it

is to consult nature herself about nature.

Therefore we shall ﬁrst give general instructions for compiling such

a history; then we shall set before men's eyes its particular form, with

occasional remarks on the purpose to which the inquiry has to be ﬁtted and

adapted as well as its subject, so that when the scope of the thing is properly

understood and envisaged, it may bring other things into men's minds

which perhaps we have missed. We have chosen to call this history the

Primary History or Mother History.

Aphorisms

On Compiling a Primary History

Aphorism I

Nature exists in three states and accepts three kinds of regime. She is either

free and unfolding in her own ordinary course, or driven from her state by

the vicious and insolent assaults of matter and by the force of obstructions,



The New Organon

or constrained and shaped by human art and agency. The ﬁrst state refers

to the species of things, the second to prodigies, the third to artiﬁcial things.

For in artiﬁcial things nature accepts the yoke from the empire of man; for

these things would never have been done without man. A completely new

face is given to bodies by human eﬀort and agency, a diﬀerent universe of

things, a diﬀerent theatre. There are, consequently, three forms of natural

history. It deals either with the Freedom of nature or with the Errors of

nature or with the Bonds of nature; so that a good division we might make

would be a history of Births, a history of Prodigious Births, and a history of

Arts; the last of which we have also often called the Mechanical and the

Experimental Art. But we are not prescribing that the three should be

treated separately. Why may not the histories of prodigies in particular

species be rightly joined with the history of the species themselves?

Artiﬁcial things too are sometimes rightly joined with species, and some-

times better separated. It will be best therefore to decide this in each indi-

vidual case. For excess of method and lack of method equally give rise to

repetitions and prolixity.

II

Natural history, as we have said, has three subjects, but two uses. It is used

either for knowledge of the things which are committed to the history, or

it is used as the ﬁrst matter of philosophy and the stuﬀ and material of true

induction. The latter use is now under discussion; now, I say, and never

ever before this. For neither Aristotle nor Theophrastus nor Dioscorides

nor Caius Plinius,2 much less the moderns, ever suggested this purpose (of

which we speak) for natural philosophy. The main point is that those who

take on the role of writing history hereafter should constantly reﬂect and

bear in mind that they are not to serve the pleasure of the reader nor the

immediate advantage which can be got from reports, but must ﬁnd and

build a store of things suﬃciently large and varied to formulate true axioms.

If they keep this in mind, they will prescribe for themselves the means of

such a history. For the end governs the means.

2 Aristotle (–), Greek philosopher and investigator of nature, founded the Lyceum as a school

of philosophy and research; Theophrastus (c. – ) succeeded him as head of the Lyceum and

is particularly known for his History of Plants. Dioscorides (a physician of the st century ) wrote

a Herbal which remained standard for centuries. C. Plinius (= ‘Pliny the Elder',  c. –) wrote

Historia naturalis, an encyclopedia of the natural science of his day, and famously died while attempt-

ing to study the eruption of Vesuvius in  .

But the more eﬀort and labour this enterprise entails, the less appropriate

it is to load it down with irrelevancies. Men need to be clearly warned

against putting too much eﬀort into three things which enormously

increase the amount of work, but add little or nothing to its quality.

First, then, they must do without antiquities and citations of authors and

authorities; also disputes, controversies and dissenting opinions – in a word,

philology. Do not cite an author except in a matter of doubtful credit; do not

introduce a controversy except in a case of great importance. Reject every-

thing that makes for ornament of speech, and similes, and the whole reper-

toire of eloquence, and such vanities. State all the things you accept brieﬂy

and summarily, so that there may be no more words than there are things.

For no one who collects and stores materials for buildings or ships or such

structures places them prettily (like window-dressers) and shows them oﬀ

to please, but only makes sure that they are good and sound, and take up the

least space in the warehouse. That is just the way it should be done here.

Secondly, there is little point in natural histories, indulging in numerous

descriptions and pictures of species and in minute varieties of the same

things. Such petty variations are nothing more than nature's fun and

games, and are quite close to the nature of an individual. They oﬀer a kind

of ramble through the things themselves which is attractive and delightful,

but give little information for the sciences, and what they do give is more

or less superﬂuous.

Thirdly, we have to bid a stern farewell to all superstitious stories (I do

not say stories of prodigies when the memory of them is reliable and

probable, but superstitious stories), and experiments of ritual magic. We do

not want the infancy of philosophy, which gets its ﬁrst breast from natural

history, to become used to old women's stories. There will perhaps be time

(after we have penetrated a little more deeply into the investigation of

nature) for skimming through them, so that if there is any natural virtue in

those dung-heaps, it may be extracted and put to use. Meanwhile they

should be kept away. Also experiments of natural magic should be carefully

checked and severely critiqued before being accepted, especially those

which are commonly derived from vulgar sympathies and antipathies, a

very idle practice that depends on a combination of facile credulity and

imaginative invention.

We have already achieved a good deal by ridding natural history of these



The New Organon

three superﬂuous things (just mentioned), which otherwise would have

filled volumes. But this is not the end. In a great work it is equally necessary

to describe what is accepted succinctly as it is to cut out superﬂuities,

though it is evident that such purity and brevity will give much less

pleasure to reader and writer alike. We must constantly repeat the point

that we are merely building a warehouse or storage space; not a place in

which one is to stay or live with pleasure, but which one enters only when

necessary, when something has to be taken out for use in the work of the

Interpreter which follows.

IV

In the history which we seek and intend, we must be sure above all that it

is extensive and made to the measure of the universe. The world must not

be contracted to the narrow limits of the understanding (as it has been

heretofore), but the understanding must be liberated and expanded to take

in the image of the world as it is found to be. The habit of looking only at a

few things and of giving a judgement on the basis of a few things has ruined

everything. And so we take up the division of natural history which we

made just now (of Births, Prodigious Births and Arts), and assign ﬁve parts

to the history of births. The ﬁrst will be of the ether and the heavens. The

second, of the sky3 and the regions (as they call them) of the air. The third,

of earth and sea. The fourth, of the elements (as they call them) of ﬂame or

ﬁre, air, water and earth. We want elements to be understood in the sense

not of the prime qualities of things, but of the major constituents of natural

bodies. For the nature of things is so distributed that the quantity or mass

of certain bodies is very great, because their structure requires the texture

of an easy and common material; such are the four substances which I

mentioned. But the quantity of certain other bodies in the universe is small

and occurs rarely, because the texture of their matter is very diﬀerent, very

subtle and for the most part delimited and organic; such are the species of

natural things, metals, plants, animals. For this reason we have chosen to

call bodies of the ﬁrst kind major associations, and the latter minor associations.

The major associations come into the fourth part of history, under the

name of elements, as we have said. I am not confusing the fourth part with

the second or third parts simply because in each of them I have mentioned

3 Meteora, a Greek word, refers, in Bacon, both to the regions of the sky below the heavens and to the

bodies in the sky (some of which are meteors in our sense).

Outline of a natural and experimental history

air, water and earth. For in the second and third parts I have given the

histories of them as integral parts of the world and so far as they contribute

to the fabric and structure of the universe; but the fourth contains the

history of their substance and nature, which ﬂourishes in the similar parts

of each of them, but does not relate to the whole. Finally, the ﬁfth part of

the history contains the minor associations or species, with which natural

history to this point has been particularly concerned.

As far as concerns the history of Prodigious Births, we have already said

that it goes best with the history of Births; we are referring to history which

is natural as well as prodigious. For we insist on relegating the superstitious

history of miracles (of whatever kind) to a special treatise of its own; nor

should it be started right at the beginning, but a little later, when we have

penetrated more deeply into the investigation of nature.

We establish three kinds of history of Arts and of nature changed and

altered by man, or Experimental history. Either it is drawn from the

Mechanical Arts; or from the practical part of the liberal sciences; or from

several practices and experiments which do not form an art of their own,

and which in fact sometimes occur as the result of the lowest kind of

experience and do not aspire to form an art.

And so once a history has been compiled from all the sources that I have

mentioned, Generation, Prodigies, Arts and Experiments, nothing is

omitted which may equip the senses to give information to the under-

standing. And we shall no longer be leaping around in little circles (like

dervishes), but in our progress we shall walk the boundaries of the world.

V

The most useful of the parts of history which we have mentioned is the

history of arts; it shows things in motion, and leads more directly to practice.

It also lifts the mask and veil from natural things, often hidden and

obscured by a variety of shapes. And the manipulations of art are like the

bonds and shackles of Proteus, which reveal the ultimate strivings and

struggles of matter. For bodies refuse to be destroyed or annihilated, but

shift into various other shapes. Therefore we must put aside our arrogance

and scorn, and give our full attention to this history, despite the fact that it

is a mechanics' art (as it may seem), illiberal and mean.

The preferable arts are those which present, alter and prepare natural

bodies and the materials of things, like agriculture, cookery, chemistry, dye-



The New Organon

ing, the manufacture of glass, enamel, sugar, gunpowder, ﬁreworks, paper

and suchlike. Of less value are things which essentially consist in the

subtle motion of hands and tools, such as weaving, carpentry and metal-

work, building, the manufacture of mill-wheels, clocks and so on; though

they are certainly not to be ignored either, both because many things occur

in them which relate to the alterations of natural bodies, and because they

give accurate information about local motion, which is of the highest

importance for many things.

In the whole body of this history of the Arts, one piece of advice above

all needs to be given and taken to heart: we must accept not only experiments

which are relevant to the purpose of the art, but any experiments which

happen to come up. For example, locusts or crabs when cooked turn red

(before cooking they have the colour of mud); this has nothing to do with

preparing a meal; but it is quite a good instance for the investigation of

redness, since the same thing happens in baked bricks. Similarly, meat is

more quickly salted in winter than in summer; this not only warns the cook

to preserve his foods properly and as much as required, but is also a good

instance for indicating the nature and eﬀect of cold. For this reason it is

a cardinal error (to use an expression) to think that our plan is being

followed if experiments of art are collected with the sole aim of improving

the individual arts. For although in many cases we do not altogether con-

demn this, our plan however actually is that the streams of all mechanical

experiments should run from all directions into the sea of philosophy. It is

on the basis of the privileged instances that we should select the more

signiﬁcant instances in every kind (and we must seek them out and track

them down with every care and eﬀort).

VI

We should also summarise here what we treated at greater length in

Aphorisms ,  and  of the First Book. Here it may be enough to

give a brief command in the form of an instruction: accept into this history,

ﬁrst, the commonest things which one might think it superﬂuous to put

into writing because they are so familiar; then mean things, illiberal, dis-

gusting (for all things are pure to the pure, and if the tax receipts from urine4

4 The emperor Vespasian placed a tax on urine. When his son Titus protested, Vespasian held a coin

derived from this tax before his nose and asked him if it smelt. Titus had to admit that it did not. ‘And

yet it comes from piss', said Vespasian (Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, ‘Life of Vespasian', ).



Outline of a natural and experimental history

smelt good, much more so is the light and information we may get from

any source); also, trivial, childish things (and no wonder, for we must

become again as children, utterly);5 ﬁnally, things which seem to be exces-

sively subtle, because they are of no use in themselves. For (as I have said)

the things we have exhibited in this history have been collected for their

own sakes; and therefore it is not fair to measure their dignity in them-

selves, but so far as they can be transferred to other things, and contribute

to philosophy.

VII

We also prescribe that all things in both natural bodies and natural powers

be (as far as possible) numbered, weighed, measured and determined. For

we are planning works, not speculations. And a proper combination of

physics and mathematics yields practical results. For this reason we must

investigate and we must describe, in the history of heavenly things, the

exact returnings and distances of the planets; in the history of land and sea,

the extent of land and how much of the surface it occupies compared with

waters; in the history of air, how much compression it permits without

powerful resistance; in the history of metals, how much heavier one

metal is than another; and countless other things of this kind. When exact

measurements are not to be had, then we must certainly have recourse to

unspeciﬁed estimates and comparisons: for example, if perhaps we lack

conﬁdence in the astronomers' calculations of distances, that the moon is

within the shadow of the earth, that Mercury is above the moon, and so on.

And when we cannot make intermediate measurements, we should set out

the measurements at the limit: for example, that a fairly weak magnet lifts

iron to a certain weight, in relation to the weight of the stone itself; and that

the most powerful magnet raises as much as sixty times its own weight; as

we have seen happen in the case of a very small armed magnet. We know

well enough that these determinate instances do not often or easily occur,

but need to be sought out as aids (when the situation most demands it) in

the actual course of investigation. If however they should occur by chance,

they should be included in the natural history if they do not too much delay

the process of completing it.

VIII

As for the reliability of what should be accepted into a history: they are

necessarily either absolutely reliable, dubiously reliable or not reliable at

all. Things of the ﬁrst kind we should simply report; things of the second

kind we record with a remark, i.e. with the words ‘it is reported, or they

say, or I have heard from a reliable source', and so on. It would be too

tedious to include the arguments on both sides, and will certainly hold

the writer up too long. And it makes little diﬀerence to the question under

discussion, since (as we said in Aphorism  of Book I) the false experi-

ments, if not too prevalent, will soon be shown up by true axioms. However,

if the instance is very notable, either in the use itself or because many

other things may depend on it, then one certainly has to give the name

of the author, and not just his name, but with a remark as to whether his

statement is based on a report or description (as is nearly always the case

in the writings of Caius Plinius) or on his own knowledge; also whether

the thing happened in his own time or in the past; and whether it was the

sort of thing that requires many witnesses to be true; ﬁnally, whether

the author has shown himself to be boastful and frivolous or strict and

sober; and similar points which go to the question of reliability. Finally,

there are things which are completely unreliable and yet widely and popu-

larly believed, things which have stayed current for centuries, partly

through neglect and partly through the use of analogies (e.g. that a

diamond binds a magnet, garlic takes away its power, amber attracts every-

thing except basil, and so on); it is not appropriate simply to ignore these;

we have to ban their use in so many words, so that they will no longer

trouble the sciences.

It would also be useful to note the origin of any foolish or credulous

belief if one should come across it, the belief, for example, that the herb

savory has the power of exciting desire for the simple reason that its root

has the shape of testicles. The truth is that it has this shape because a new

bulb is made every year while the previous year's bulb is still in place, and

that is why it is double. This is evident from the fact that the new root is

found to be solid and juicy, while the old one is withered and spongy. So

it is not surprising that one sinks in water while the other ﬂoats; yet this

is thought to be a marvel, and has given credence to the herb's other

powers.

IX

There are some useful additions to a natural history which may make it

more ﬁt and helpful to the subsequent work of an interpreter. They are ﬁve.

First, questions (not of causes but of fact) should be added, to encourage

and provoke further investigation; for example, in the history of land and

sea, whether the Caspian sea has tides, and at what intervals; whether there

is a Southern continent, or only islands; and so on.

Secondly, in any new experiment of any subtlety, we should append the

actual method used in the experiment, so that men may have the opportu-

nity to judge whether the information it produced is reliable or deceptive,

and also to encourage men to apply themselves to look for more accurate

methods (if there are any).

Thirdly, if there is anything doubtful or questionable in any account, we

are wholly against suppression or silence about it; a full and clear note

should be attached as a remark or warning. We want the ﬁrst history to be

composed with utter scrupulousness, as if an oath had been taken about the

truth of every detail; for it is the volume of the works of God, and (so far as

one may compare the majesty of the divine with the humble things of the

earth) like a second Scripture.

Fourth, it would not be out of place to insert occasional observations (as

C. Plinius did); for example, in the history of land and sea, that the shape

of the lands (so far known) in relation to the seas is narrow and almost

pointed to the south, wide and broad to the north; the shape of the seas is

the opposite; and the great oceans cut through the lands in channels that

run north–south rather than east–west, except perhaps in the furthest

polar regions. Also it is a good thing to add canons (which are simply

general and universal observations); for example, in the history of heavenly

bodies, that Venus is never more than  degrees from the sun, Mercury,

; and that the planets which lie above the sun move very slowly, since

they are furthest from earth and the planets below the sun very fast.

Another kind of observation to make, which has never yet been used,

despite its importance, is this: to append to an account of what is a

mention of what is not. For example, in the history of heavenly things, that

no star is found to be oblong or triangular, but that every star is globular:

either simply globular like the moon, or spiky in appearance but globular

at the centre, like the other stars, or apparently shaggy but globular at the

centre, like the sun; or that the stars are scattered about in no order at all,



The New Organon

so that there is no such thing among them as a quincunx or a quadrangle

or any other perfect ﬁgure (despite the names they have been given, like

delta, crown, cross, chariot etc.); hardly even a straight line, except perhaps

in the belt and dagger of Orion.

Fifthly, something which quite depresses and destroys a believer will

perhaps help an investigator: namely to survey in a brief and summary

form of words the currently accepted opinions in all the variety of the

diﬀerent schools; enough to wake up the intellect and no more.

X

This is enough for general precepts. If they are carefully observed, the

historical task will go straight towards its purpose, and will not get too big.

But if it seems to some faint-hearted person to be an immense task, even in

this circumscribed and limited form, let him turn his eyes to the libraries;

and among other things, let him look on one side at the texts of the civil and

canon law, and on the other at the commentaries of the doctors and the

jurists on them; and let him see the diﬀerence between them with regard

to bulk and volume. Brevity suits us; like faithful scribes, we pick up and

write down the very laws of nature, and nothing else; brevity is almost

imposed by things themselves. Opinions, dogmas and speculations, how-

ever, are innumerable; there is no end to them.

In the Plan of our Work we mentioned the cardinal powers in nature,

and that one must compose their history before approaching the task

of interpretation. We have not forgotten this, but have kept it for ourselves

to do, since we dare not rely fully on other men's labour in this area

until they have begun to develop a rather closer familiarity with nature.

Now therefore we should move on to an outline account of Particular

Histories.

But as we are now distracted by business, we have only the time to

append a Catalogue of titles of Particular Histories. As soon as we have the

leisure for the task, we plan to give detailed instructions by putting the

questions that most need to be investigated and written up in each history

because they help to fulﬁl our purpose, like certain particular Topics. Or

rather (to use the language of civil procedure) we intend, in this Great Suit

or Trial, given and granted by the goodness and providence of God (by

which the human race seeks to recover its right over nature), to cross-

examine nature herself and the arts on the articles of the case.

those which contribute to constructing Philosophy. But these things will

be best decided for each case.
