## 0601. Exploration Techniques

New ideas, and the combination of old ideas in new ways, are essential elements of effective analysis. Some structured techniques are specifically intended for the purpose of exploring concepts and eliciting ideas at various stages of a project, and they are the topic of this chapter. Exploration Techniques help analysts create new approaches and transform existing ideas, knowledge, and insights into something novel but meaningful. They help analysts identify potential new sources of information or reveal gaps in data or thinking and provide a fresh perspective on long-standing issues.

Imagination is more important than knowledge. For while knowledge defines all we currently know and understand, imagination points to all we might yet discover and create.

—Albert Einstein

A continuing debate in the field of intelligence analysis is who makes the "best" analyst: an individual with subject-matter expertise or a creative generalist with good critical thinking skills. The reality is that both do, but specialists with deep knowledge of a given subject tend to focus primarily on their domain, and generalists, who often move from one subject to another throughout their careers, can come across as "facile." Yet both types of analysts are called upon to generate new or different thoughts, create new processes and procedures, and help clients avoid surprise.

In one sense, all Structured Analytic Techniques are Exploration Techniques when used in collaborative group processes. A structured process helps identify and explore differences in perspective and different assumptions among team or group members, and thus stimulates learning and new ideas. A group or team using a Structured Analytic Technique is almost always more effective than a single individual in generating new ideas and in synthesizing divergent ideas.

All the Exploration Techniques embrace brainstorming as part of their process. The goal of brainstorming is to be innovative and generate new ideas, but even this avowedly creative process requires structure to be effective. People sometimes say they are brainstorming when they sit with a few colleagues and try to come up with new ideas, but such a freewheeling process rarely generates the creative breakthroughs the group is seeking. Brainstorming is most effective when it is structured. Experience has shown that analysts should follow eight basic rules to optimize the value of a brainstorming session:

Be specific about the purpose and the topic of the brainstorming session. Announce the topic beforehand and ask participants to come to the session with some ideas or to forward them to the facilitator before the session. Begin the session by writing down everyone's initial inputs on a whiteboard or easel. Never criticize an idea, no matter how weird, unconventional, or improbable it might sound. Instead, try to figure out how the idea might be applied to the task at hand. Allow only one conversation at a time; ensure that everyone has an opportunity to speak. Allocate enough time to complete the brainstorming session. It often takes one hour to set the rules of the game, get the group comfortable, and exhaust the conventional wisdom on the topic. Only then do truly creative ideas begin to emerge. Engage all participants in the discussion; sometimes this might require "silent brainstorming" techniques, such as asking everyone to be quiet for a few minutes to write down their key ideas and then discuss as a group what everyone wrote down. Include one or more "outsiders" in the group to avoid Groupthink and stimulate divergent thinking. One practical definition of an "outsider" is someone who is not processing the same information or information from the same generic sources as the members of the core group. Write it down! Track the discussion for everyone to see by using a whiteboard, an easel, or self-stick notes. Summarize key findings. Ask the participants to write down their key takeaway or the most important thing they learned on an index card as they depart the session. Then prepare a short summary and distribute the list to the participants (who may add items to the list) and to others interested in the topic (including supervisors and those who could not attend).

Exploration Techniques are helpful in combating many cognitive biases, which Daniel Kahneman says occur when analysts lack precision while making continuous assessments to supply quick answers to difficult problems. 1 They are particularly effective in countering the impulse to answer complicated questions rapidly (Mental Shotgun) and to select the first answer that seems adequate (Satisficing), as distinct from assessing multiple options to find the optimal or best answer. The term Satisficing was coined by Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon by combining the words satisfy and suffice . 2 The "satisficer" who does seek out additional information may look only for information that supports the initial answer. A better course of action is to use structured techniques to look broadly at all the possibilities.

Exploration Techniques help analysts avoid the intuitive traps of assuming the same dynamic is in play when something appears to be in accord with past experiences (Projecting Past Experiences). They also help guard against failing to factor something into the analysis because the analyst lacks an appropriate category or "bin" for that item of information (Lacking Sufficient Bins).

Overview of Techniques

Simple Brainstorming is one of the most widely used analytic techniques. It is usually conducted in small groups but can also be done as an individual exercise.

Cluster Brainstorming is a form of silent brainstorming that uses self-stick notes, follows specific rules and procedures, and requires a facilitator. It is often used to develop a comprehensive picture or map of all the forces, factors, events, and players that relate to a given topic or issue. It requires little training, and it is one of the most frequently used structured techniques in the U.S. Intelligence Community.

Nominal Group Technique serves much the same function as Cluster Brainstorming but uses a quite different approach. It is the preferred technique when there is concern that a senior member or outspoken member of the group may dominate the meeting, that junior members may be reluctant to speak up, or that the meeting may lead to heated debate. Nominal Group Technique encourages equal participation by requiring participants to present ideas one at a time in round-robin fashion until all participants feel that they have run out of ideas.

Circleboarding™ is a method for capturing the journalist's list of Who, What, How, When, Where, and Why to develop a comprehensive picture of a topic. The technique adds a final question, So What, to spur analysts to assess the impact of the development and implications for the client.

Starbursting is a form of brainstorming that focuses on generating questions rather than answers. To help in defining the parameters of a research project, use Starbursting to identify the questions that need to be answered. Questions start with the words Who, What, How, When, Where, and Why. Brainstorm each of these words, one at a time, to generate as many questions as possible about the research topic.

Venn Analysis is a visual technique that helps analysts explore the logic of arguments and illustrate sets of relationships in analytic arguments. It is a powerful tool for showing the relative significance of change over time and for illustrating large volumes of data in an easily digested format.

Network Analysis is used to illustrate associations among individuals, groups, businesses, or other entities; the meaning of those associations to the people involved; and the degrees and ways in which those associations can be strengthened or weakened. It has been highly effective in helping analysts identify and understand patterns of organization, authority, communication, travel, and financial transactions.

6.1 Simple Brainstorming

Simple Brainstorming is an individual or group process designed to generate new ideas and concepts. A brainstorming session usually exposes an analyst to a greater range of ideas and perspectives than the analyst could generate alone. This broadening of views typically results in a better analytic product. To be successful, brainstorming must focus on a specific issue and the results captured in a final written product.

When to Use It

Analysts most often use Simple Brainstorming at the beginning of a project to identify a list of relevant variables, key drivers, alternative scenarios, key players or stakeholders, available evidence or sources of information, possible solutions to a problem, potential outcomes or scenarios, or all the forces and factors relevant to a given situation. Later in the process, it can be used to help break the team out of an analytic rut, stimulate new investigative leads, generate new research or collection requirements, and design new lines of argument or theories of a case. In most instances, a brainstorming session can be followed with Cross-Impact Analysis to examine the relationship between each of the variables, players, or other factors identified by the brainstorming.

Value Added

The goal of any type of brainstorming session is to generate as many ideas as possible to expand the range of ideas and perspectives to consider. Brainstorming can involve any number of processes designed to enhance creativity but is most productive when it is structured. Intelligence analysts have found brainstorming particularly effective in helping mitigate the intuitive traps of giving too much weight to first impressions, lacking an appropriate category or bin for an item of information, allowing firsthand information to have too much impact, and expecting change to be only marginal or incremental.

The Method

Brainstorming is conducted in many different ways (see Figure 6.1 for an example of one technique). The facilitator or group leader should present the focal question, explain and enforce the ground rules, keep the meeting on track, stimulate discussion by asking questions, record the ideas, and summarize the key findings. Participants should be encouraged to express every idea that pops into their heads. Even ideas that are outside the realm of the possible may stimulate other ideas that are more feasible. The group should have at least four and no more than twelve participants. Five to seven is an optimal number; if there are more than twelve people, the group should be split into two sections to conduct parallel brainstorming exercises. The following discussion describes several techniques you can use to engage in individual or group brainstorming.

Word or Visual Storming.

This method consists of selecting a random word or picture—related to the issue or not—and using that word or visual to "trigger" thoughts. Ideally, settle on a word or picture not related to the topic or issue because the "word" may force you to stretch your mind. An easy way to select a word is to open a dictionary or magazine and point your finger at the open page. Where your finger lands, that's the word, or the picture on the page you opened; you could also pick a word or picture on the previous or next page. After you select a word or picture, answer the following questions:

What is the meaning of the word or what words come to mind when you look at the picture? What is the word or picture associated with? What is happening in the picture? How is the word used or what is a synonym for the word?

Figure 6.1 Engaging All Participants Using the Index Card Technique

Ask yourself how the word or picture could be related to the issue or problem. For example, when considering who a newly-elected prime minister or president might appoint to a particularly tough Cabinet job, the word "basketball" or a picture of a basketball court might generate ideas such as team game, team player, assigned position, coaching, player development, winning, hoops and balls, time outs, periods of play, or winners and losers. Each of those terms could trigger subsequent ideas about the type of official who would be "ideal" for the job.

A freewheeling, informal group discussion session will often generate new ideas, but a structured group process is more likely to succeed in helping analysts overcome existing mindsets, "empty the bottom of the barrel of the obvious," and come up with fresh insights and ideas.

Paper Recording.

Paper Recording is a silent technique that is a variant of Nominal Group Technique (discussed later in this chapter). This group method requires each participant to write down one to four ideas on the topic on a piece of paper initially distributed by the facilitator or organizer.

After jotting down their ideas, participants place their papers in a central "pick-up point." They select a piece of paper (not their own) from the "pick-up point" and add to the ideas on the paper. The process continues until participants run out of ideas. Participants can hold up or "play" a colored card to note when they have exhausted their ideas. A facilitator harvests and records the ideas.

Relationship to Other Techniques

Any form of brainstorming is commonly combined with a wide variety of other techniques. It is often an early step in analytic projects used to identify ideas, variables, evidence, possible outcomes, suspects, or hypotheses that are then processed by using other structured techniques. Other forms of brainstorming described in this chapter include Nominal Group Technique, Circleboarding™, Mind Maps, and Venn Analysis.

Origins of This Technique

Brainstorming was a creativity technique used by advertising agencies in the 1940s. It was popularized in a book by advertising manager Alex Osborn, Applied Imagination: Principles and Procedures of Creative Problem Solving (New York: Scribner's, 1953). There are many versions of brainstorming. The techniques described in this book are a combination of information in the Handbook of Analytic Tools and Techniques, 5th ed. (Tysons, VA: Pherson Associates, LLC, 2019) and training materials used throughout the global intelligence community.

6.2 Cluster Brainstorming

Cluster Brainstorming is a systematic, multistep process for conducting group brainstorming that employs silent brainstorming and self-stick notes. It allows group members to alternate between divergent and convergent ideas, generating comprehensive lists of new ideas. Cluster Brainstorming requires a facilitator, in part because participants cannot talk during the brainstorming session.

In previous editions of this book, Cluster Brainstorming was referred to as Structured Brainstorming. The authors chose to change the name of the technique for this edition because all forms of brainstorming—ranging from Simple Brainstorming to Mind Maps to Outside-In Thinking—require structure to be effective.

When to Use It

Cluster Brainstorming is used widely in the intelligence community and increasingly in the private sector at the beginning of a project. Many will also employ it later in the analytic process to pull the team out of an analytic rut and to stimulate new thinking.

Value Added

The stimulus for creativity comes from two or more analysts bouncing ideas off each other. A Cluster Brainstorming session usually exposes an analyst to a greater range of ideas and perspectives than the analyst could generate alone, and this broadening of views typically results in a better analytic product. The technique can help mitigate the impact of Groupthink, Premature Closure, and accepting evidence as true because it helps create a coherent picture (Evidence Acceptance Bias).

In addition, analysts have found it effective in helping them overcome the intuitive traps of failing to factor something into the analysis because the analyst lacks an appropriate category or "bin" for that item of information (Lacking Sufficient Bins), focusing on a narrow range of alternatives representing only modest change (Expecting Marginal Change), and continuing to hold to a judgment when confronted with a mounting list of contradictory evidence (Rejecting Evidence).

The Method

Many versions of Cluster Brainstorming are in common usage. The following process has worked well in intelligence and law enforcement communities to generate key drivers for Multiple Scenarios Generation, a set of alternative hypotheses when investigating a situation, or a list of key factors to explain a behavior. The process is divided into two phases: a divergent thinking (creative) phase when ideas are presented, and a convergent thinking (analytic) phase when these ideas are evaluated.

Pass out self-stick notes and marker-type pens to all participants. A group of ten to twelve contributors works best. Tell those present that no one can speak except the facilitator during the initial collection phase of the exercise. Write the question you are brainstorming on a whiteboard or easel. The objective is to make the question as open-ended as possible. For example, Cluster Brainstorming focal questions often begin with "What are all the (things/forces and factors/circumstances) that would help explain . . .?" Ask the participants to write down their responses to the question on self-stick notes. Participants are asked to capture the concept with a few key words that will fit on the self-stick note. The facilitator then collects the self-stick notes from the participants. After an initial quiet time of two minutes, the facilitator begins to read the self-stick notes out loud. The quiet time allows participants time to reflect and process before the facilitator starts talking again. The facilitator puts all the self-stick notes on the wall or a whiteboard as he/she reads them aloud (see Figure 6.2 ). All ideas are treated the same. Participants are urged to listen to and build on one another's ideas. Usually there is an initial spurt of ideas followed by pauses as participants contemplate the question. After five or ten minutes, expect a long pause of a minute or so. This slowing down suggests that the group has "emptied the barrel of the obvious" and is now on the verge of coming up with some fresh insights and ideas. Facilitators should not talk during this pause, even if the silence is uncomfortable. After a couple of long pauses, facilitators conclude this divergent stage of the brainstorming process. They then ask a subset of the group to go up to the board and silently arrange the self-stick notes into affinity groups (basically grouping the ideas by like concept). The group should arrange the self-stick notes in clusters, not in rows or columns. The group should avoid putting the self-stick notes into obvious groups like "economic" or "political." Group members cannot talk while they are doing this. If one self-stick note seems to "belong" in more than one group, make a copy and place one self-stick note in each affinity group. If the group has many members, those who are not involved in arranging the self-stick notes should be asked to perform a different task. For example, the facilitator could make copies of several of the self-stick notes that were considered outliers because the group at the board has not fit them into any obvious group or the items evoked laughter when read aloud. One of these outliers is given to each table or to each smaller group of participants, who then are asked to explain how that outlier relates to the primary task. When the group at the board seems to slow down organizing the notes, ask a second small group to go to the board and review how the first group arranged the self-stick notes. The second group cannot speak, but members are encouraged to continue to rearrange the notes into more coherent groups. Usually the exercise should generate five to ten affinity groupings on the board. When all the self-stick notes have been arranged, members of the group at the board can converse among themselves to pick a word or phrase that best describes each affinity grouping. Pay attention to outliers or self-stick notes that do not belong in a particular group. Such an outlier could either be useless noise or, more likely, contain a gem of an idea that deserves further elaboration as a theme. If outlier self-stick notes were distributed earlier in the exercise, ask each group to explain how that outlier is relevant to the issue. To identify the potentially most useful ideas, the facilitator or group leader should establish up to five criteria for judging the value or importance of the ideas. If so desired, then use the Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing technique, described in chapter 5 , for voting on or ranking or prioritizing ideas. Another option is to give each participant ten votes. Tell them to come up to the whiteboard or easel with a marker and place their votes. They can place ten votes on a single self-stick note or affinity group label, one vote each on ten self-stick notes or affinity group labels, or any combination in between. Tabulate the votes. Assess what you have accomplished and what areas will need more work or more brainstorming. Then ask the group, "What do you see now that you did not see before?" Review the key ideas or concepts as well as new areas that need more work or further brainstorming. Set priorities based on the voting results, decide on the next steps for analysis, and develop an action plan.

Relationship to Other Techniques

Cluster Brainstorming is also called Structured Brainstorming and Divergent/Convergent Thinking. The authors prefer the term Cluster Brainstorming because any brainstorming technique should be structured to be effective.

Origins of This Technique

The description of Cluster Brainstorming is taken from the discussion of "Cluster Brainstorming," in Handbook of Analytic Tools and Techniques , 5th ed. (Tysons, VA: Pherson Associates, LLC, 2019), and training materials used throughout the global intelligence community.

6.3 Nominal Group Technique

Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is a process for generating and evaluating ideas. It is a form of brainstorming, but NGT has always had its own identity as a separate technique. The goals of Nominal Group Technique and other forms of brainstorming are the same—the generation of good, innovative, and viable ideas. NGT, however, differs from Simple Brainstorming in several ways. Most importantly, ideas are presented one at a time in round-robin fashion.

When to Use It

NGT prevents the domination of a discussion by a single person. Use it whenever concerns arise that a senior officer or executive or an outspoken member of the group or perhaps even experts in the field will control the direction of the meeting by speaking before anyone else. It is also appropriate to use NGT rather than other structured brainstorming techniques if there is concern that some members may not speak up, or the issue under discussion is controversial and may provoke a heated debate. The index card technique is another way to accomplish these objectives.

NGT is also effective when coordinating the initial conceptualization of a problem before the research and writing stages begin. Like brainstorming, NGT is commonly used to identify ideas (assumptions, hypotheses, drivers, causes, variables, important players) that can then be incorporated into other methods.

Value Added

NGT can be used both to generate ideas and to provide backup support in a decision-making process where all participants are asked to rank or prioritize the ideas generated. If it seems desirable, all ideas and votes can be anonymous. Compared with Simple Brainstorming, which usually seeks to generate the greatest possible number of ideas—no matter how far out they may be—NGT may focus on a limited list of carefully considered opinions.

The technique allows participants to focus on each idea as it is presented, rather than having to think simultaneously about preparing their own ideas and listening to what others are proposing—a situation that often happens with Simple or Cluster Brainstorming. NGT encourages piggybacking on ideas that have already been presented—in other words, combining, modifying, and expanding others' ideas.

The Method

An NGT session starts with the facilitator asking an open-ended question such as "What factors will influence . . . ?" "How can we learn if . . . ?" "In what circumstances might . . . happen?" "What should be included or not included in this research project?" The facilitator answers any questions and then gives participants a few minutes to work privately to jot down their initial responses to the focal question on index cards. The process then proceeds according to these steps:

The facilitator calls on one person at a time to present one idea. As each participant presents his or her idea, the facilitator writes a summary description on a flip chart or whiteboard. This process continues in a round-robin fashion until all ideas have been exhausted. If individuals have run out of ideas, they "pass" when called upon for an idea, but they can participate again later if they have another idea when their turn comes up again. The facilitator can also be an active participant, announcing and then writing down his or her own ideas. There is no discussion until all ideas are presented; however, the facilitator can clarify ideas to avoid duplication. When no new ideas are forthcoming, the facilitator initiates a group discussion to ensure there is a common understanding of what each idea means. The facilitator asks about each idea, one at a time, in the order presented, but does not allow any argument for or against the idea. At this time, the participants can expand or combine ideas, but no change can be made to an idea without the approval of the original presenter of the idea. Voting to rank or prioritize the ideas as discussed in chapter 5 is optional, depending upon the purpose of the meeting. If adopted, voting is best done by secret ballot, although various voting procedures may be used depending upon the number of ideas and the number of participants. It usually works best to employ a ratio of one vote for every three ideas presented. For example, if the facilitator lists twelve ideas, each participant has four votes. The group can also decide to let participants give one idea more than one vote. In this case, someone could give three votes to one idea and another idea only one vote. An alternative procedure is for each participant to write what he or she considers the best four ideas on an index card. One might rank the four ideas by giving 4 points for the best idea, 3 points for the next best, 2 points for the next best, and 1 point for the least favored idea. The cards are then passed to the facilitator for tabulation and announcement of the scores. In such circumstances, a second round of voting may be needed to rank the top ideas.

Relationship to Other Techniques

Analysts should consider other forms of brainstorming as well as Nominal Group Technique to determine which technique is most appropriate for the conditions in which it will be used.

Origins of This Technique

Nominal Group Technique was developed by A. L. Delbecq and A. H. Van de Ven and first described in "A Group Process Model for Problem Identification and Program Planning," Journal of Applied Behavioral Science VII (July–August, 1971): 466–491. The discussion of NGT here is a synthesis of several sources: James M. Higgins, 101 Creative Problem Solving Techniques: The Handbook of New Ideas for Business, rev. ed. (Winter Park, FL: New Management Publishing Company, 2006); "What Is Nominal Group Technique?" American Society for Quality, http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/idea-creation-tools/overview/nominal-group.html ; "Nominal Group Technique," http://syque.com/quality_tools/toolbook/NGT/ngt.htm ; and "Nominal Group Technique," www.mycoted.com/Nominal_Group_Technique .

6.4 Circleboarding™

Circleboarding™ captures the Who, What, How, When, Where, Why, and So What of a topic. It visually depicts the known information about differing aspects of a topic of concern or interest. Circleboarding™ focuses on exploring the answers to the journalist's classic five W's and H but adds a final question: So What? The So What? question spurs the analyst to consider the impact of the event or the implications of the topic and helps focus on the key message to deliver to the client.

When to Use it

Use Circleboarding™ at the start of a project to gain a thorough, group-wide understanding of a topic. After deciding on the topic, assemble all researchers, investigators, or analytic contributors and use Circleboarding™ to determine what is already known about each aspect of the subject. A facilitator must marshal the group through the process.

Circleboarding ™ is also effective in generating indicators or a set of scenarios. Questions to consider when creating indicators include

Who could potentially emit an indicator? What indicator would they emit? How would this indicator manifest? How might we miss it? When would we be most likely to see this indicator? Where would we be most likely to see this indicator? Why is this indicator important? What do we want the indicators to tell us as a set?

Value Added

Circleboarding™ provides a systematic overview of a topic or issue. The brainstorming process helps promote widespread, collaborative understanding of the topic for all those involved in the project, regardless of their specific area of research focus. The cooperative approach of Circleboarding™ also encourages investigators to combine ideas in new or different ways to imbue the analysis with increased rigor.

The technique can stimulate discussion beyond just consolidating known information by identifying gaps or weak points in the group's knowledge and encouraging discussion of stated and unstated assumptions and what further collection and research is needed to fill the gaps. Circleboarding™ can be a powerful tool for mitigating the impact of misapplied heuristics, including the tendency to provide quick and easy answers to difficult questions (Mental Shotgun), predict rare events based on weak evidence or evidence that easily comes to mind (Associative Memory), and select the first answer that appears "good enough" (Satisficing). Use of the technique can also diminish the impact of intuitive traps, such as Overinterpreting Small Samples, Ignoring the Absence of Information, and Projecting Past Experiences.

Circleboarding™ promotes thorough investigation of a topic and well-informed analysis. Detailed graphics can present the results of an exhaustive investigation in a crisp and easily digestible format.

The Method

Setup. Draw a circle and write the following words around the circle: Who, What, How, When, Where, and Why (see Figure 6.4 ). The order follows how a declarative sentence is written in English (who did what, for what reason). The What and the How are next to each other because they often overlap conceptually. In the middle of the circle, write "So What?" Define the Topic. Begin by asking the group to validate the discussion topic and agree on the objectives of the session. Seek Answers. Systematically work through each question asking the group to "shout out" what they know about the topic as it relates to each question. Write down the answers.

Figure 6.4 The Circleboarding™ Technique Reflect. After going around the circle, ask the group to reflect on their responses and suggest which of the questions appears most important to the analysis. Prioritize Results. In some cases, highlight or prioritize the responses to the most important questions. So What? Initiate a final discussion to explore the So What? question in the center of the circle. Final Product. Capture all the input on a single graphic and distribute it to participants and others interested in the topic for comment.

Relationship to Other Techniques

Circleboarding™ is a simpler version of Starbursting (presented next in this chapter) that focuses on exploring the answers to—rather than generating questions related to—the journalist's classic list of queries: Who, What, How, When, Where, and Why. Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing ( chapter 5 ) can be helpful in prioritizing the clusters of answers that result.

Origins of This Technique

Circleboarding™ was developed by Pherson Associates as an alternative to Starbursting. The technique can be particularly helpful for analysts working in law enforcement, medicine, and financial intelligence investigating money laundering, who focus mostly on generating tactical analytic products and are often pressed for time.

6.5 Starbursting

Starbursting is a form of brainstorming that focuses on generating questions rather than eliciting ideas or answers. It uses the six questions commonly asked by journalists: Who? What? How? When? Where? and Why?

When to Use It

Use Starbursting to help define your research requirements and identify information gaps. After deciding on the idea, topic, or issue to be analyzed, brainstorm to identify the questions that need to be answered by the research. Asking the right questions is a common prerequisite to finding the right answer.

Value Added

Starbursting uses questions commonly asked by journalists (Who, What, How, When, Where, and Why) to spur analysts and analytic teams to ask the questions that will inevitably arise as they present their findings or brief their clients. In thinking about the questions, analysts will often discover new and different ways of combining ideas.

Starbursting is useful in combating cognitive limitations analysts often experience, including focusing attention on a vivid scenario while ignoring other possibilities (Vividness Bias), the tendency to provide quick and easy answers to difficult questions (Mental Shotgun), and predicting rare events based on weak evidence or evidence that easily comes to mind (Availability Heuristic). It also can help analysts reduce the effect of several intuitive traps, including Relying on First Impressions, Assuming a Single Solution, and Projecting Past Experiences.

The Method

The term "Starbursting" comes from the image of a six-pointed star. To create a Starburst diagram, begin by writing one of the following six words at each point of the star: Who, What, How, When, Where, and Why. Then start the brainstorming session, using one of these words at a time to generate questions about the topic. Usually it is best to discuss each question in the order provided, in part because the order also approximates how English sentences are constructed. The What and the How are next to each other because they often overlap conceptually.

Often only three or four of the words are directly relevant to the intelligence question. In cyber analysis, the Who is often difficult to define. For some words (for example, When or Where), the answer may be a given and not require further exploration.

Do not try to answer the questions as they are identified; just focus on developing as many questions as possible. After generating questions that start with each of the six words, ask the group either to prioritize the questions to be answered or to sort the questions into logical categories. Figure 6.5 is an example of a Starbursting diagram. It identifies questions to be asked about a terrorist group that launched a biological attack in a subway.

Relationship to Other Techniques

This Who, What, How, When, Where, and Why approach can be combined effectively with the Issue Redefinition and Getting Started Checklist methods mentioned in the introduction to chapter 5 and described more fully in Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence . 3 Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing ( chapter 5 ) is helpful in prioritizing the questions to be worked on. Starbursting is also directly related to several Diagnostic Techniques discussed in chapter 7 , such as the Key Assumptions Check. In addition, it can be used to order the analytic process used in Indicators Validation in chapter 9 .

Origins of This Technique

Starbursting is one of many techniques developed to stimulate creativity. The basic idea for the design of Figure 6.5 comes from the MindTools website: www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT_91.htm .

6.6 Mind Maps and Concept Maps

Mind Maps and Concept Maps are visual representations of how an individual or a group thinks about a topic of interest. Such a diagram has two basic elements: the ideas that are judged relevant to whatever topic one is thinking about, and the lines that show and briefly describe the connections among these ideas. The two dominant approaches to creating such diagrams are Mind Mapping and Concept Mapping (see Figures 6.6a and 6.6b ). Other approaches include cognitive, causal, and influence mapping as well as idea mapping. There are many commercial and freely available software products that create meaningful diagrams used by diverse groups within the intelligence community. 4

When to Use It

Whenever analysts think about a problem, develop a plan, or consider making even a simple decision, they are putting a series of thoughts together. That series of thoughts can be represented visually with words or images connected by lines that represent the nature of the relationships among them. Any type of thinking, whether about a personal decision or analysis of an intelligence issue, can be diagrammed in this manner. Such mapping is usually done for either of two purposes:

By an individual or a group to help sort out ideas and achieve a shared understanding of key concepts. By getting the ideas down on paper or a computer screen, the individual or group is better able to remember, critique, and modify them. To facilitate the communication to others of a complex set of relationships. Examples are an intelligence report, a briefing or graphic prepared by an analyst for prosecutors to use in a jury trial, or notes jotted while in class.

Mind Maps can help analysts brainstorm the various elements or key players involved in an issue and how they might be connected. The technique stimulates analysts to ask questions such as, Are there additional categories or "branches on the tree" that we have not considered? Are there elements of this process or applications of this technique that we have failed to capture? Does the Mind Map suggest a different context for understanding the problem?

Analysts and students find that Mind Maps and Concept Maps are useful tools for taking notes during an oral briefing or lecture. By developing a map as the lecture proceeds, the analyst or student can chart the train of logic and capture all the data presented in a coherent map with all key elements on a single page. The map also provides a useful vehicle for explaining to someone else in an organized way what was presented in the briefing or lecture.

Concept Maps are also frequently used as teaching tools. Most recently, they have been effective in developing "knowledge models," in which large sets of complex Concept Maps are created and hyperlinked together to represent analyses of complex domains or problems.

Value Added

Mapping facilitates the presentation or discussion of a complex body of information. It is useful because it presents a considerable amount of information that can generally be seen at a glance. Creating a visual picture of the basic structure of a complex problem helps analysts be as clear as possible in stating precisely what they want to express. Diagramming skills enable analysts to stretch their analytic capabilities.

Mind Maps and Concept Maps vary greatly in size and complexity depending on how and why they are used. When used for structured analysis, a Mind Map or a Concept Map is typically larger, sometimes much larger, than the examples shown in this chapter.

Like any model, such a map is a simplification of reality. It does not necessarily try to capture all the nuances of a complex system of relationships. Instead, it provides an outline picture of the overall structure of a system of variables, showing which variables are relevant to a given problem or issue and how they are related to one another. Once you have this information, you are well on the way toward knowing what further research needs to be done and perhaps even how to organize the written report. For some projects, the diagram can be the analytical product or a key part of it.

When a group creates a Mind Map or Concept Map, its principal value may be the process the group went through to construct the map, not the map itself. When a group gets together to identify all the parts of a complex system and figure out how the parts relate to one another, the process often elicits new ideas, clarifies concepts, identifies relevant bodies of knowledge, and brings to the surface—and often resolves—differences of opinion at an early stage of a project before anything is put in writing. Although such a map may be a bare skeleton, the discussion will have revealed a great deal more information than can be shown in a single map.

The mapping process gives the group a shared experience and a common basis for further discussion. Creating a map ensures that the initial effort reflects the group's definition of the problem, not something done by one member of the group and then presented after the fact for coordination by the others. Some mapping software supports virtual collaboration so that analysts at different locations can work on a map simultaneously and see one another's work as it progresses. 5

After having defined the problem, the group should be better able to identify what further research needs to be done and able to parcel out additional work among the best-qualified members of the group. The group should also be better able to prepare a report that represents as fully as possible the collective wisdom of the group.

Mind Maps and Concept Maps help mitigate the impact of several cognitive biases and misapplied heuristics, including the tendency to provide quick and easy answers to difficult questions (Mental Shotgun), to predict rare events based on weak evidence or evidence that easily comes to mind (Associative Memory), and to select the first answer that appears "good enough" (Satisficing). They can also provide an antidote to intuitive traps such as Overinterpreting Small Samples, Ignoring the Absence of Information, Confusing Causality and Correlation, and overrating the role of individual behavior and underestimating the importance of structural factors (Overestimating Behavioral Factors).

The Method

Start a Mind Map or Concept Map with an inclusive question that focuses on defining the issue or problem. Then follow these steps:

Make a list of concepts that relate in some way to the focal question. Starting with the first dozen or so concepts, sort them into groupings within the diagram space in some logical manner. These groups may be based on things they have in common or on their status as either direct or indirect causes of the matter being analyzed. Begin making links among related concepts, starting with the most general concepts. Use lines with arrows to show the direction of the relationship. The arrows may go in either direction or in both directions. Choose the most appropriate words for describing the nature of each relationship. The lines might be labeled with words such as "causes," "influences," "leads to," "results in," "is required by," or "contributes to." Selecting good linking phrases is often the most difficult step. While building all the links among the concepts and the focal question, look for and enter cross-links among concepts. Don't be surprised if, as the map develops, you discover that you are now diagramming on a different focus question from the one with which you started. This can be a good thing. The purpose of a focus question is not to lock down the topic but to get the process going. Finally, reposition, refine, and expand the map structure as appropriate.

Mind Mapping and Concept Mapping can be done manually, but mapping software makes movement of concepts and creation of links much easier and faster. Many different software programs are available for various types of mapping, and each has strengths and weaknesses. These products are usually variations of the main contenders: Mind Mapping and Concept Mapping. The two leading techniques differ in the following ways:

Mind Mapping has only one main or central idea, and all other ideas branch off from it radially in all directions. The central idea is preferably shown as an image rather than in words, and images are used throughout the map. Around the central word, draw the five or ten main ideas that relate to that word. Then take each of these first-level words and again draw the five or ten second-level ideas that relate to each of the first-level words. 6 A Concept Map has a more flexible form. It can have multiple hubs and clusters. It can also be designed around a central idea, but it does not have to be and often is not designed that way. It does not normally use images. A Concept Map is usually shown as a network, although it too can be shown as a hierarchical structure like Mind Mapping when that is appropriate. Concept Maps can be very complex and are often meant to be viewed on a large-format screen.

Relationship to Other Techniques

Mind and Concept Mapping can be used to present visually the results generated by other techniques, especially the various types of brainstorming and/or Cross-Impact Analysis, described in chapters 6 and 7 .

Origins of This Technique

Mind Mapping was originally developed as a fast and efficient way to take notes during briefings and lectures. Concept Mapping was originally developed as a means of mapping students' emerging knowledge about science; it has a foundation in the constructivist theory of learning, which emphasizes that "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures." 7

Mind Maps and Concept Maps have been given new life by the development of software that makes them more useful and easier to use. For information on Mind Mapping, see Tony and Barry Buzan, The Mind Map Book (Essex, England: BBC Active, 2006). Information on Concept Mapping is available at http://cmap.ihmc.us/conceptmap.html .

6.7 Venn Analysis

Venn Analysis is a visual technique that analysts can use to explore the logic of arguments. Venn diagrams consist of overlapping circles and are commonly used to teach set theory in mathematics. Each circle encompasses a set of objects; objects that fall within the intersection of circles are members of both sets. A simple Venn diagram typically shows the overlap between two sets. Circles can also be nested within one another, showing that one thing is a subset of another in a hierarchy. Figure 6.7a is an example of a Venn diagram. It describes the various components of critical thinking and how they combine to produce synthesis and analysis.

Venn diagrams can illustrate simple sets of relationships in analytic arguments; we call this process Venn Analysis. When applied to argumentation, it can reveal invalid reasoning. For example, in Figure 6.7b , the first diagram shows the flaw in the following argument: Cats are mammals, dogs are mammals; therefore, dogs are cats. As the diagram shows, dogs are not subsets of cats, nor are any cats subsets of dogs; therefore, they are distinct subsets, but both belong to the larger set of mammals. Venn Analysis can also validate the soundness of an argument. For example, the second diagram in Figure 6.7b shows that the argument that cats are mammals, tigers are cats, and therefore tigers are mammals is true.

Description Figure 6.7A Venn Diagram of Components of Critical Thinking

Description Figure 6.7B Venn Diagram of Invalid and Valid Arguments

When to Use It

Intelligence analysts use this technique to organize their thinking, look for gaps in logic or data, and examine the quality of an argument. The tool is also effective in determining how to satisfy a narrow set of conditions when multiple variables must be considered—for example, in determining the best time to launch a satellite. Venn Analysis is also useful when an argument involves a portion of something that is being compared with other portions or subsets.

One other application is to use Venn Analysis as a brainstorming tool to see if new ideas or concepts are needed to occupy every subset in the diagram. The technique can be done individually but works better when done in groups.

Value Added

Venn Analysis helps analysts determine if they have put like things in the right groups and correctly identified what belongs in each subset. The technique makes it easier to visualize arguments, often revealing flaws in reasoning or spurring analysts to examine their assumptions by making assumptions explicit when constructing the diagram. Examining the relationships between the overlapping areas of a Venn diagram helps put things in perspective and often prompts new research or deeper inquiry. Care should be taken, however, not to make the diagrams too complex by adding levels of precision that may not be justifiable.

Venn Analysis protects analysts against seeing patterns in random events as systematic and part of a coherent world (Desire for Coherence and Uncertainty Reduction), accepting data as true because the data help create a more coherent story (Evidence Acceptance Bias), and offering quick and easy answers to difficult questions (Mental Shotgun). Venn Analysis also helps mitigate the impact of several intuitive traps, particularly Ignoring Inconsistent Evidence, Presuming Patterns, and failing to factor something into the analysis because the analyst lacks an appropriate category or "bin" for that item of information (Lacking Sufficient Bins).

The Method

Venn Analysis is an agile tool that can be applied in various ways. It is a simple process but can spark prolonged debate. The following steps show how Venn Analysis is useful when examining the validity of an argument:

Represent the elements of a statement or argument as circles. Use large circles for large concepts or quantities. Examine the boundaries of the circles. Are they well defined or "fuzzy"? How are these things determined, measured, or counted? Consider the impact of time. Are the circles growing or shrinking? This is especially important when looking at trends. Check the relative size and relationships between the circles. Are any assumptions being made? Ask whether there are elements within the circles that should be added. Examine and compare overlapping areas. What is found in each zone? What is significant about the size of each zone? Are these sizes likely to change over time?

Example

Consider this analytic judgment: "The substantial investments state-owned companies in the fictional country of Zambria are making in U.S. port infrastructure projects pose a threat to U.S. national security."

Using Venn Analysis, the analyst would first draw a large circle to represent the autocratic state of Zambria, a smaller circle within it representing state-owned enterprises, and small circles within that circle to represent individual state-owned companies. A mapping of all Zambrian corporations would include more circles to represent other private-sector companies as well as a few that are partially state-owned (see Figure 6.7c ). Simply constructing this diagram raises several questions, such as What percentage of companies are state-owned, partially state-owned, or privately owned? Do the percentages correspond to the size of the circles? What is the definition of "state-owned"? What does "state-owned" imply politically and economically in a nondemocratic state like Zambria? Do these distinctions even matter? The answer to this last question would determine whether Zambrian companies should be represented by one, two, or three circles.

The diagram should prompt the analyst to examine several assumptions implicit in the questions:

Does state-owned equate to state-controlled? Should we assume that state-owned enterprises would act contrary to U.S. interests? Would private-sector companies be less hostile or even supportive of free enterprise and U.S. interests?

Figure 6.7C Venn Diagram of Zambrian Corporations

Each of these assumptions, made explicit by the Venn diagram, can now be challenged. For example, the original statement may have oversimplified the problem. Perhaps the threat may be broader than just state-owned enterprises. Could Zambria exert influence through its private companies or private-public partnerships?

The original statement refers to investment in U.S. port infrastructure projects by companies in Zambria. The overlap in the two circles in Figure 6.7d depicts which of these companies are investing in U.S. port infrastructure projects. The Venn diagram shows that only private Zambrian companies and one private-public partnership are investing in U.S. port infrastructure projects. Additional circles could be added showing the level of investment in U.S. port infrastructure improvement projects by companies from other countries. The large circle enveloping all the smaller circles would represent the entirety of foreign investment in all U.S. infrastructure projects. By including this large circle, readers get a sense of what percentage of total foreign investment in U.S. infrastructure is targeted on port improvement projects.

Figure 6.7d , however, raises several additional questions:

Can we assume Zambrian investors are the biggest investors in U.S. port infrastructure projects? Who would be their strongest competitors? How much influence does their share of the investment pie give them? Can we estimate the overall amount of Zambrian investment in infrastructure projects and where it is directed? If Zambrian state-owned companies are investing in other U.S. projects, are the investments related only to companies doing work in the United States or also overseas? Do we know the relative size of current port infrastructure improvement projects in the United States as a proportion of all port improvement investments being made globally? What percentage of foreign companies are working largely overseas in projects to improve port infrastructure or critical infrastructure as more broadly defined? What percentage of these companies are functioning as global enterprises or as state-owned or state-controlled companies?

Many analytic arguments highlight differences and trends, but it is important to put these differences into perspective before becoming too engaged in the argument. By using Venn Analysis to examine the relationships between the overlapping areas of the Venn diagram, analysts have a more rigorous base from which to organize and develop their arguments. In this case, if the relative proportions are correct, the Venn Analysis would reveal a more important national security concern: Zambria's position as an investor in U.S. port infrastructure improvement projects could give it significant economic as well as military advantage.

Figure 6.7D Zambrian Investments in Global Port Infrastructure Projects

Relationship to Other Techniques

Venn Analysis is like other decomposition and visualization techniques discussed in chapter 5 . It is also useful as a graphical way to conduct a Key Assumptions Check or assess whether alternative hypotheses are mutually exclusive—two techniques described in chapter 7 .

Origins of This Technique

This application of Venn diagrams as a tool for intelligence analysis was developed by John Pyrik for the Government of Canada. The materials are used with the permission of the Canadian government. For more discussion of this concept, see Peter Suber, Earlham College, "Symbolic Logic," at http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/log/loghome.htm ; and Lee Archie, Lander University, "Introduction to Logic," at http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic .

6.8 Network Analysis

Network Analysis is the review, compilation, and interpretation of data to determine the presence of associations among individuals, groups, businesses, or other entities; the meaning of those associations to the people involved; and the degrees and ways in which those associations can be strengthened or weakened. 8 It is the best method available to help analysts understand and identify opportunities to influence the behavior of a set of actors about whom information is sparse. In the fields of law enforcement and national security, information used in Network Analysis usually comes from informants or from physical or technical surveillance. These networks are most often clandestine and therefore not visible to open source collectors. Although software has been developed to help collect, sort, and map data, it is not essential to many of these analytic tasks. Social Network Analysis, which involves measuring associations, does require software.

Analysis of networks is broken down into three stages, and analysts can stop at the stage that answers their questions:

Network Charting is the process of and associated techniques for identifying people, groups, things, places, and events of interest (nodes) and drawing connecting lines (links) between them according to various types of association. The product is often referred to as a Link Chart. Network Analysis is the process and techniques that strive to make sense of the data represented by the chart by grouping associations (sorting) and identifying patterns in and among those groups. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is the mathematical measuring of variables related to the distance between nodes and the types of associations to derive even more meaning from the chart, especially about the degree and type of influence one node has on another.

When to Use It

Network Analysis is used extensively in law enforcement, counterterrorism analysis, and analysis of transnational issues, such as narcotics and weapons proliferation, to identify and monitor individuals who may be involved in illegal activity. It is often the first step in an analysis as it helps the analyst map who is involved in an issue, how much each individual matters, and how individuals relate to one another. Network Charting (or Link Charting) is used literally to "connect the dots" between people, groups, or other entities of intelligence or criminal interest. Network Analysis puts these dots in context, and Social Network Analysis helps identify hidden associations and degrees of influence between the dots.

Value Added

Network Analysis is effective in helping analysts identify and understand patterns of organization, authority, communication, travel, financial transactions, or other interactions among people or groups that are not apparent from isolated pieces of information. It often identifies key leaders, information brokers, or sources of funding. It can identify additional individuals or groups who need to be investigated. If done over time, it can help spot change within the network. Indicators monitored over time may signal preparations for offensive action by the network or may reveal opportunities for disrupting the network.

SNA software helps analysts accomplish these tasks by facilitating the retrieval, charting, and storage of large amounts of information. Software is not necessary for this task, but it is enormously helpful. The Social Network Analysis software included in many Network Analysis packages is essential for measuring associations.

The Method

Analysis of networks attempts to answer the question, "Who is related to whom and what is the nature of their relationship and role in the network?" The basic Network Analysis software identifies key nodes and shows the links between them. SNA software measures the frequency of flow between links and explores the significance of key attributes of the nodes. We know of no software that does the intermediate task of grouping nodes into meaningful clusters, though algorithms do exist and are used by individual analysts. In all cases, however, you must interpret what is represented, looking at the chart to see how it reflects organizational structure, modes of operation, and patterns of behavior.

Network Charting.

The key to good Network Analysis is to begin with a good chart. An example of such a chart is Figure 6.8a , which shows the terrorist network behind the attacks of September 11, 2001. It was compiled by networks researcher Valdis E. Krebs using data available from news sources on the internet in early 2002.

Several tried and true methods for making good charts will help the analyst to save time, avoid unnecessary confusion, and arrive more quickly at insights. Network charting usually involves the following steps:

Identify at least one reliable source or stream of data to serve as a beginning point. Identify, combine, or separate nodes within this reporting. List each node in a database, association matrix, or software program.

Description Figure 6.8A Social Network Analysis: The September 11 Hijackers Source: Valdis Krebs, "Connecting the Dots: Tracking Two Identified Terrorists," Figure 3, Orgnet.com, last modified 2008, www.orgnet.com/tnet.html . Reproduced with permission of the author. Identify interactions among individuals or groups. List interactions by type in a database, association matrix, or software program. Identify each node and interaction by some criterion that is meaningful to your analysis. These criteria often include frequency of contact, type of contact, type of activity, and source of information. Draw the connections between nodes—connect the dots—on a chart by hand, using a computer drawing tool, or using Network Analysis software. If you are not using software, begin with the nodes that are central to your intelligence question. Make the map more informative by presenting each criterion in a different color or style or by using icons or pictures. A complex chart may use all these elements on the same link or node. The need for additional elements often happens when the intelligence question is murky (for example, when "I know something bad is going on, but I don't know what"); when the chart is being used to answer multiple questions; or when a chart is maintained over a long period of time. Work out from the central nodes, adding links and nodes until you run out of information from the good sources. Add nodes and links from other sources, constantly checking them against the information you already have. Follow all leads, whether they are people, groups, things, or events, regardless of source. Make note of the sources. Stop in these cases: When you run out of information, when all the new links are dead ends, when all the new links begin to turn in and start connecting with one another like a spider's web, or when you run out of time. Update the chart and supporting documents regularly as new information becomes available, or as you have time. Just a few minutes a day will pay enormous dividends. Rearrange the nodes and links so that the links cross over one another as little as possible. This is easier if you are using software. Many software packages can rearrange the nodes and links in various ways. Cluster the nodes. Do this by looking for "dense" areas of the chart and relatively "empty" areas. Draw shapes around the dense areas. Use a variety of shapes, colors, and line styles to denote different types of clusters, your relative confidence in the cluster, or any other criterion you deem important. "Cluster the clusters," if you can, using the same method. Label each cluster according to the common denominator among the nodes it contains. In doing this, you will identify groups, events, activities, and/or key locations. If you have in mind a model for groups or activities, you may be able to identify gaps in the chart by what is or is not present that relates to the model. Look for "cliques"—a group of nodes in which every node is connected to every other node in the group, though not to many nodes outside the group. These groupings often look like stars or pentagons. In the intelligence world, they often turn out to be clandestine cells. Look in the empty spaces for nodes or links that connect two clusters. Highlight these nodes with shapes or colors. These nodes are brokers, facilitators, leaders, advisers, media, or some other key connection that bears watching. They also point where the network is susceptible to disruption. Chart the flow of activities between nodes and clusters. You may want to use arrows and time stamps. Some software applications will allow you to display dynamically how the chart has changed over time. Analyze this flow. Does it always go in one direction or in multiple directions? Are the same or different nodes involved? How many different flows are there? What are the pathways? By asking these questions, you can often identify activities, including indications of preparation for offensive action and lines of authority. You can also use this knowledge to assess the resiliency of the network. If one node or pathway were removed, would there be alternatives already built in? Continually update and revise as nodes or links change.

Network Analysis.

Figure 6.8b is a modified version of the 9/11 hijacker network depicted in Figure 6.8a . It identifies the different types of clusters and nodes discussed under Network Analysis. Cells are star-like or pentagon-like line configurations, potential cells with star-like or pentagon-like line configurations are circled, and the large diamond surrounds a cluster of cells. Brokers are shown as nodes overlaid with small hexagons. Note the broker in the center. This node has connections to all but one of the other brokers. This is a senior leader: Al-Qaeda's former head of operations in Europe, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas.

Social Network Analysis.

Social Network Analysis requires a specialized software application. It is important, however, for analysts to familiarize themselves with the basic process and measures and the specialized vocabulary used to describe position and function within the network. The following three types of centrality are illustrated in Figure 6.8c :

Degree centrality: This is measured by the number of direct connections that a node has with other nodes. In the network depicted in Figure 6.8c , Deborah has the most direct connections. She is a "connector" or a "hub" in this network. Betweenness centrality: Helen has fewer direct connections than does Deborah, but she plays a vital role as a "broker" in the network. Without her, Ira and Janice would be cut off from the rest of the network. A node with high "betweenness" has great influence over what flows—or does not flow—through the network. Closeness centrality: Frank and Gary have fewer connections than does Deborah, yet the pattern of their direct and indirect ties allows them to access all the nodes in the network more quickly than anyone else. They are in the best position to monitor all the information that flows through the network.

Potential Pitfalls

This method is extremely dependent upon having at least one good source of information. It is hard to know when information may be missing, and the boundaries of the network may be fuzzy and constantly changing, in which case it is difficult to determine whom to include. The constantly changing nature of networks over time can cause information to become outdated. You can be misled if you do not constantly question the data being entered, update the chart regularly, and look for gaps and consider their potential significance.

You should never rely blindly on the SNA software but strive to understand how the application works. As is the case with any software, different applications measure different things in different ways, and the devil is always in the details.

Mind maps are used in learning, meetings, education, problem, planning, presentations, and education. Learning: Recall, such as reviewing and summarizing. Noting, such as lectures, books, entertainment, and in media such as television, radio, newspapers, and computers. Meetings: Negotiations. 1 on 1s. Groups. Chairing. Summaries, such as disagreements, minutes, actions, and agreements. Education: Relationships. Place, such as year, term, and lessons. Exploration. Lecturing, such as preparing and delivering. Problem: Definition. Identification. Solving individually, in a group, and brainstorming. Planning: Creativity. Time. Personal activities, such as holidays and parties. Organization of knowledge, such as study and integrate, and projects. Presentation: Preparations. Written, such as reports, essays, articles, exams, and projects. Oral, such as informal, formal, talks, speeches, debates, seminars, and selling.

Concept maps were invented by Joseph Novak's research team, and represent organized knowledge, beliefs, and feelings. They differ from rote memorization, and are expressed in the terms of concepts and propositions. They are context dependent, and are necessary for effective teaching, effective learning, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. Concepts are defined as perceived regularities in objects and events, and are given as labels, that can be words, such as risk, hypothesis, and motive, and symbols, such as 57 percent. Propositions may be cross-links to show interrelations. They are structured in a hierarchical morphology. Interrelations and hierarchical morphology facilitate creativity, which is needed to see interrelations. Hierarchical morphology arranges context and major concepts at the top, and detailed knowledge at the bottom.

The Venn diagram consists of three intersecting ellipses, labeled logic, data and evidence, and issue and customer identification. The intersection of logic, and issue and customer identification is framing and argumentation. The intersection of logic, and data and evidence is gaps and assumptions. The intersection of data and evidence, and issue and customer identification is source credibility. The intersection of all the ellipses is synthesis and analysis.
