## 0501. Getting Organized

A significant challenge analysts face is managing the large volume of data that must be processed and evaluated to develop an analytic line and generate a well-sourced, high-quality product. Most people can keep only a limited amount of information in the forefront of their minds. Imagine that a person must make a difficult decision, such as what car to buy or where to go on vacation. A good first step is to make a list of all the relevant information and arguments for or against taking an action. When it comes time to make the decision, however, the list may be so long that weighing all the pros against the cons at the same time becomes a daunting task. As a result, the person is likely to vacillate, focusing first on the pros and then on the cons, favoring first one decision and then the other. Suppose how much more difficult it would be for an analyst to think through a complex intelligence problem with large volumes of data and many interacting variables. The limitations of human thought make it difficult, if not impossible, to do error-free analysis without the support of some external representation of the parts of the problem at hand.

Two common approaches for coping with this limitation of our working memory are as follows:

Decomposition , which is breaking down the problem or issue into its component parts so that each part can be considered separately Visualization , which is capturing all the parts of the problem or issue in some organized manner, often a visual representation, that is designed to facilitate understanding how the various parts interrelate

All Structured Analytic Techniques employ these approaches, as the externalization of one's thinking is part of the definition of structured analysis. For some of the simpler techniques, however, decomposing an issue to present the data in an organized manner is the principal contribution they make to producing more effective analysis.

The use of a simple checklist can be extremely productive in getting organized at the start of a project. 1 In Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence , Pherson and Pherson discuss how the use of checklists and critical-thinking mnemonics such as the Knowing Your Client Checklist, Getting Started Checklist, AIMS ( A udience, I ssue, M essage, and S toryline), and Issue Redefinition can aid the process. 2 These techniques can be combined to help analysts conceptualize and launch a new project. Critical time can be saved if an analyst can start off in the right direction and avoid having to change course later.

In this chapter, we describe five basic approaches to organizing your data and getting started with your analysis.

Analysis is breaking information down into its component parts. Anything that has parts also has a structure that relates these parts to each other. One of the first steps in doing analysis is to determine an appropriate structure for the analytic problem, so that one can then identify the various parts and begin assembling information on them. Because there are many different kinds of analytic problems, there are also many different ways to structure analysis.

—Richards J. Heuer Jr., Psychology of Intelligence Analysis (1999)

Overview of Techniques

Sorting is a basic technique for organizing data in a manner that often yields new insights. It is particularly effective during initial data gathering and hypothesis generation.

Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing techniques are used to organize items on any list according to the item's importance, desirability, priority, value, or probability of happening.

Matrices are generic analytic tools for sorting and organizing data in a manner that facilitates comparison and analysis. They are used to analyze the relationships among any two sets of variables or the interrelationships among a single set of variables. A matrix consists of a grid with as many cells as needed for the problem under study. Matrices are used so frequently to analyze a problem that we have included several distinct techniques in this book.

Process Maps are used to identify and diagram each step in a complex process. Many different versions exist, including Event Flow Charts, Activity Flow Charts, and Value Stream Maps. Analysts can use the techniques to track the progress of plans or projects undertaken by a business competitor, foreign government, a criminal or terrorist group, or any other non-state actor.

Gantt Charts are a specific type of Process Map that uses a matrix to chart the progression of a multifaceted process over a specific time period. Process Maps and Gantt Charts were developed primarily for use in business and the military, but they are also useful to intelligence analysts.

Other comparable techniques for organizing and presenting data include various types of graphs, diagrams, and trees. We did not discuss them in this book because they are well covered in other works, and it was necessary to draw a line on the number of techniques included here.

5.1 Sorting

Sorting is a basic technique for organizing a large body of data in a manner that often yields new insights.

When to Use It

Sorting is effective when information elements can be broken out into categories or subcategories for comparison with one another, most often by using a computer program, such as a spreadsheet. This technique is particularly useful during the initial data-gathering and hypothesis-generation phases of analysis.

Value Added

Sorting large amounts of data into relevant categories that are compared with one another can provide analysts with insights into trends, similarities, differences, or abnormalities that otherwise would go unnoticed. When you are dealing with transactional data in particular (for example, geospatial information or transfers of goods or money), it is helpful—if not essential—to sort the data first.

The Method

Follow these steps:

Review the categories of information to determine which category or combination of categories might show trends or abnormalities that would provide insight into the problem you are studying. Use a structured brainstorming technique, such as Cluster Brainstorming or Outside-In Thinking, to ensure you have generated a comprehensive list of categories. Place the data into a spreadsheet or a database using as many fields (columns) as necessary to differentiate among the data types (dates, times, locations, people, activities, amounts, etc.). List each of the facts, pieces of information, or hypotheses involved in the problem that are relevant to your sorting schema. (Use paper, whiteboard, movable self-stick notes, or other means for this.) Review the listed facts, information, or hypotheses in the database or spreadsheet to identify key fields that may allow you to uncover possible patterns or groupings. Those patterns or groupings then illustrate the schema categories that deserve the most attention. For example, if an examination of terrorist activity shows that most attacks occur in hotels and restaurants but that the time of day of the attack varies, "Location" and "Time of Day" become key categories. Choose a category and sort the data within that category. Look for any insights, trends, or oddities. Good analysts notice trends; great analysts notice anomalies. Review (or ask others to review) the sorted facts, information, or hypotheses to see if there are alternative ways to sort them. List any alternative sorting schema for your problem. One of the most useful applications for this technique is to sort according to multiple schemas and examine results for correlations between data and categories. But remember that correlation is not the same as causation.

Examples

Example 1: Are a foreign adversary's military leaders pro-United States, anti-United States, or neutral on their attitudes toward U.S. policy in the Middle East? To answer this question, analysts sort the leaders by various factors that might give insight into the issue, such as birthplace, native language, religion, level of professional education, foreign military or civilian/university exchange training (where/when), field/command assignments by parent service, political influences in life, and political decisions made. Then analysts review the information to see if any parallels exist among the categories.

Example 2: Analysts review the data from cell-phone communications among five conspirators to determine the frequency of calls, patterns that show who is calling whom, changes in patterns of frequency of calls prior to a planned activity, dates and times of calls, and subjects discussed.

Example 3: Analysts are reviewing all information related to an adversary's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. Electronic intelligence reporting shows more than 300,000 emitter transmissions were collected over the past year alone. The analysts' sorting of the data by type of emitter, dates of emission, and location shows varying increases and decreases of emitter activity with some minor trends identifiable. The analysts filter out all collections except those related to air defense. The unfiltered information is sorted by type of air defense system, location, and dates of activity.

Of note is a period when there is an unexpectedly large increase of activity in the air defense surveillance and early warning systems. The analysts review relevant external events and find that a major opposition movement outside the country held a news conference where it detailed the adversary's WMD activities, including locations of the activity within the country. The air defense emitters for all suspected locations of WMD activity, including several not included in the press conference, increased to a war level of surveillance within four hours of the press conference. The analysts reviewed all air defense activity locations that showed the increase assumed to be related to the press conference and the WMD program and found two locations showing increased activity but not previously listed as WMD-related. These new locations were added to collection planning to determine what relationship, if any, they had to the WMD program.

Potential Pitfalls

Improper sorting can hide valuable insights as easily as it can illuminate them. Standardizing the data being sorted is imperative. Working with an analyst who has experience in sorting can help you avoid this pitfall.

Origins of This Technique

Sorting is a long-established procedure for organizing data. The description in this chapter is from Military Intelligence training materials.

5.2 Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing

This section provides guidance for using three different ranking techniques—Ranked Voting, Paired Comparison, and Weighted Ranking. Combining an Exploration Technique, such as Cluster Brainstorming, with a ranking technique is an effective way for an analyst to start a new project. Brainstorming techniques are helpful in developing lists of driving forces, variables for consideration, indicators, possible scenarios, important players, historical precedents, sources of information, questions to be answered, and so forth. Such lists are even more useful once they are ranked, scored, or prioritized to determine which items are most important, most useful, most likely, or should be at the top of the priority list.

When to Use It

A ranking technique is often the next step following the use of a structured brainstorming technique, such as Cluster Brainstorming, Mind Maps, or Nominal Group Technique (see chapter 6 ). A ranking technique is appropriate whenever there are too many items to rank easily just by looking at the list, the ranking has significant consequences and must be done as accurately as possible, or it is useful to aggregate the opinions of a group of analysts.

Value Added

A Getting Organized technique is often used to develop lists of critical events, key factors, variables to be considered, or important players. By ranking, scoring, and prioritizing such lists, analysts can determine which items are most important, most useful, most probable, and require immediate action. Combining a brainstorming technique with a ranking technique is an excellent way for an analyst to provide a foundation for collaboration within or external to an office.

The Method

Of the three methods discussed here, Ranked Voting is the easiest and quickest to use, and it is often good enough. However, it is not as accurate after you get past the top two or three ranked items, because the group usually has not thought as much (and may not care as much) about the lower-ranked items. Ranked Voting also provides less information than either Paired Comparison or Weighted Ranking. Ranked Voting shows only that one item is ranked higher or lower than another; it does not show how much higher or lower. Paired Comparison does provide this information; Weighted Ranking provides even more information. It specifies the criteria used in making the ranking, and weights are assigned to those criteria for each of the items in the list.

5.2.1 The Method: Ranked Voting

In a Ranked Voting exercise, members of the group individually rank each item in order according to the member's preference or what the member regards as the item's importance. Depending upon the number of items or the specific analytic needs, the group can decide to rank all the items or only the top three to five. The group leader or facilitator passes out simple ballots listing all the items to be voted on. Each member votes his or her order of preference. If a member views two items as being of equal preference, the votes can be split between them. For example, if two items are tied for second place, each receives a 2.5 ranking (by taking the average of 2 and 3). Any items that are not voted on fall to the bottom of the ranking list. After members of the group have voted, the votes are added up. The item with the lowest number is ranked number 1.

5.2.2 The Method: Paired Comparison

Paired Comparison compares each item against every other item, and the analyst can assign a score to show how much more important, preferable, or probable one item is than the others. This technique provides more than a simple ranking, as it shows the degree of importance or preference for each item. The list of items can then be ordered along a dimension, such as importance or preference, using an interval-type scale.

Follow these steps to use the technique:

List the items to be compared. Assign a letter to each item. Create a table with the letters across the top and down the left side, as in Figure 5.2a . The results of the comparison of each pair of items are marked in the cells of this table. Note the diagonal line of darker-colored cells. These cells are not used, as each item is never compared with itself. The cells below this diagonal line are not used because they would duplicate a comparison in the cells above the diagonal line. If you are working in a group, distribute a blank copy of this table to each participant. Looking at the cells above the diagonal row of darkened cells, compare the item in the row with the one in the column. For each cell, decide which of the two items is more important (or preferable or probable). Write the letter of the winner of this comparison in the cell, and score the degree of difference on a scale from 0 (no difference) to 3 (major difference), as in Figure 5.2a .

Description Figure 5.2A Paired Comparison Matrix Consolidate the results by adding up the total of all the values for each letter and put this number in the "Score" column. For example, in Figure 5.2a , item B has one 3 in the first row, plus one 2 and two 1s in the second row, for a score of 7. Finally, it may be desirable to convert these values into a percentage of the total score. To do this, divide the total number of scores (20 in the example) by the score for each individual item. Item B, with a score of 7, is ranked most important or most preferred. Item B received a score of 35 percent (7 divided by 20), as compared with 25 percent for item D and only 5 percent each for items C and E, which received only one vote each. This example shows how Paired Comparison captures the degree of difference between each ranking. To aggregate rankings received from a group of analysts, simply add the individual scores for each analyst.

5.2.3 The Method: Weighted Ranking

In Weighted Ranking, a specified set of criteria is used to rank items. The analyst creates a table with items to be ranked listed across the top row and criteria for ranking these items listed down the far-left column (see Figure 5.2b ). There are a variety of valid ways to conduct this ranking. We have chosen to present a simple version of Weighted Ranking here because analysts usually are making subjective judgments rather than dealing with hard numbers. As you read the following steps, refer to Figure 5.2b :

Create a table with one column for each item. At the head of each column, write the name of an item or assign it a letter to save space. Add two more blank columns on the left side of this table. Count the number of selection criteria, and then adjust the table so that it has that number of rows plus three more, one at the top to list the items and two at the bottom to show the raw scores and percentages for each item. In the first column on the left side, starting with the second row, write in all the selection criteria down the left side of the table. There is some value in listing the criteria roughly in order of importance, but that is not critical. Leave the bottom two rows blank for the scores and percentages. Now work down the second column, assigning weights to the selection criteria based on their relative importance for judging the ranking of the items. Depending on how many criteria are listed, take either 10 points or 100 points and divide these points among the selection criteria based on what the analysts believe to be their relative importance in ranking the items. In other words, decide what percentage of the decision should be based on each of these criteria. Be sure that the weights for all the selection criteria combined add up to either 10 or 100, whichever is selected. The criteria should be phrased in such a way that a higher weight is more desirable. For example, a proper phrase would be "ability to adapt to changing conditions," and an improper phrase would be "sensitivity to changing conditions," which does not indicate whether the entity reacts well or poorly. Work across the rows to write the criterion weight in the left side of each cell. Next, work across the matrix one row (selection criterion) at a time to evaluate the relative ability of each of the items to satisfy that selection criteria. Use a ten-point rating scale, where 1 = low and 10 = high, to rate each item separately. (Do not spread the ten points proportionately across all the items as was done to assign weights to the criteria.) Write this rating number after the criterion weight in the cell for each item. Again, work across the matrix one row at a time to multiply the criterion weight by the item rating for that criterion, and enter this number for each cell, as shown in Figure 5.2b .

Figure 5.2B Weighted Ranking Matrix Now add the columns for all the items. The result will be a ranking of the items from highest to lowest score. To gain a better understanding of the relative ranking of one item as compared with another, convert these raw scores to percentages. To do this, first add together all the scores in the "Totals" row to get a total number. Then divide the score for each item by this total score to get a percentage ranking for each item. All the percentages together must add up to 100 percent. In Figure 5.2b , it is apparent that item B has the number one ranking (with 20.3 percent), while item E has the lowest (with 13.2 percent).

Potential Pitfalls

When any of these techniques is used to aggregate the opinions of a group of analysts, the rankings provided by each group member are totaled and averaged. This means that the opinions of the outliers, whose views are quite different from the others, are blended into the average. As a result, the ranking does not show the range of different opinions that might be present in a group. In some cases, the identification of outliers with a minority opinion can be of great value. Further research might show that the outliers are correct.

Relationship to Other Techniques

Some form of ranking, scoring, or prioritizing is commonly used with Cluster Brainstorming, Mind Mapping, Nominal Group Technique, and the Decision Matrix, all of which generate ideas that should be evaluated or prioritized. Applications of the Delphi Method may also generate ideas from outside experts that need to be evaluated or prioritized.

Origins of This Technique

Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing are common analytic processes in many fields. All three forms of ranking described here are based largely on internet sources. For Ranked Voting, we referred to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system ; for Paired Comparison, http://www.mindtools.com ; and for Weighted Ranking, www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/dstools/choosing/criter.html .

5.3 Matrices

A matrix is an analytic tool for sorting and organizing data in a manner that facilitates comparison and analysis. It consists of a simple grid with as many cells as needed for the problem being analyzed.

Some analytic topics or problems that use a matrix occur so frequently that they are handled in this book as separate techniques. For example:

Gantt Charts (this chapter) use a matrix to analyze the relationships between tasks to be accomplished and the time period for those tasks. Paired Comparisons (this chapter) uses a matrix to record the relationships between pairs of items. Weighted Ranking (this chapter) uses a matrix to analyze the relationships between specific items and criteria for judging those items. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses and the Inconsistencies Finder™ ( chapter 7 ) use a matrix to analyze the relationships between relevant information and hypotheses. Cross-Impact Matrix ( chapter 7 ) uses a matrix to analyze the interactions among variables or driving forces that will determine an outcome. Such a Cross-Impact Matrix is part of Complexity Manager ( chapter 10 ). Indicators Evaluation ( chapter 9 ) uses a matrix to evaluate the uniqueness or diagnostic power of indicators when compared across scenarios. Opportunities Incubator™ ( chapter 10 ) uses a matrix to inform decision makers of which actions would be most effective in preventing a negative scenario from occurring or fostering the emergence of a good scenario. Decision Matrix ( chapter 10 ) uses a matrix to analyze the relationships between goals or preferences and decision options. The Impact Matrix ( chapter 10 ) uses a matrix to chart the impact a new policy or decision is likely to have on key players and how best to manage that impact.

When to Use It

Matrices are used to analyze the relationships between any two sets of variables or the interrelationships between a single set of variables. Among other things, matrices enable analysts to

compare one type of information with another, compare pieces of information of the same type, categorize information by type, identify patterns in the information, separate elements of a problem.

A matrix is such an easy and flexible tool to use that it should be one of the first tools analysts think of when dealing with a large body of data. One limiting factor in the use of matrices is that information must be organized along only two dimensions.

Value Added

Matrices provide a visual representation of a complex set of data. By presenting information visually, a matrix enables analysts to deal effectively with more data than they could manage by juggling various pieces of information in their head. The analytic problem is broken down into component parts so that each part (that is, each cell in the matrix) can be analyzed separately, while ideally maintaining the context of the problem in its entirety.

A matrix can also help establish an analytic framework for understanding a problem, to suggest a more rigorous structure for explaining a phenomenon, or to generate a more comprehensive set of alternatives.

The Method

A matrix can be used in many different ways and for many different purposes. What matrices have in common is that each has a grid with columns and rows for entering two sets of data for comparison. Organize the category headings for each set of data in some logical sequence before entering the headings for one set of data in the top row and the headings for the other set in the far-left column. Then enter the data in the appropriate cells.

Figure 5.3 , "Rethinking the Concept of National Security: A New Ecology," is an example of a complex matrix that not only organizes data but also tells its own analytic story. 3 It shows how the concept of national security has evolved over recent decades and suggests that the way we define national security will continue to expand in the coming years. In this matrix, threats to national security are arrayed along the vertical axis, beginning at the top with the most traditional actor, the nation-state. At the bottom end of the spectrum are systemic threats, such as infectious diseases or threats that "have no face." The top row of the matrix presents the three primary mechanisms for dealing with threats: military force, policing and monitoring, and collaboration. The cells in the matrix provide historic examples of how the three different mechanisms of engagement have dealt with the five different sources of threats. The top-left cell (dark color) presents the classic case of using military force to resolve nation-state differences. In contrast, at the bottom-right corner, various actors deal with systemic threats, such as the outbreak of a pandemic, by collaborating with one another.

Description Figure 5.3 Rethinking the Concept of National Security: A New Ecology Source: Pherson Associates, LLC, 2019.

Classic definitions of national security focus on the potential for conflicts involving nation-states. The top-left cell lists three military operations. In recent decades, the threat has expanded to include threats posed by subnational actors as well as terrorist and other criminal organizations. Similarly, the use of peacekeeping and international policing has become more common than in the past. This shift to a broader use of the term "national security" is represented by the other five cells (medium color) in the top left of the matrix. The remaining cells (light color) to the right and at the bottom of the matrix represent how the concept of national security is continuing to expand as the world becomes increasingly globalized.

By using a matrix to present the expanding concept of national security in this way, one sees that patterns relating to how key players collect intelligence and share information vary along the two primary dimensions. In the upper left of Figure 5.3 , the practice of nation-states is to seek intelligence on their adversaries, classify it, and protect it. As one moves diagonally across the matrix to the lower right, this practice reverses. In the lower right of this figure, information is usually available from unclassified sources and the imperative is to disseminate it to everyone as soon as possible. This dynamic can create serious tensions at the midpoint, for example, when those working in the homeland security arena must find ways to share sensitive national security information with state and local law enforcement officers.

Origins of This Technique

The description of this basic and widely used technique is from Pherson Associates, LLC, training materials. The national security matrix was developed by Randolph H. Pherson.

5.4 Process Maps

Process Mapping is an umbrella term that covers a variety of procedures for identifying and depicting the steps in a complex procedure. It includes Flow Charts of various types (Activity Flow Charts, Commodity Flow Charts, Causal Flow Charts), Relationship Maps, and Value Stream Maps commonly used to assess and plan improvements for business and industrial processes. Process Maps or Flow Charts are diagrams that analysts use to track the step-by-step movement of events or commodities to identify key pathways and relationships involved in a complex system or activity. They usually contain various types of boxes connected by lines. The boxes are connected by arrows to illustrate the flow direction of a process.

When to Use It

Flow Charts can track the flow of money and other commodities, the movement of goods through production and delivery, the sequencing of events, or a decision-making process. They help analysts document, study, plan, and communicate complex processes with simple, easy-to-understand diagrams. In law enforcement and intelligence, they are used widely to map criminal and terrorist activity.

Value Added

Flow Charts can identify critical pathways and choke points and discover unknown relationships. In law enforcement, they help analysts probe the meaning of various activities, identify alternative ways a task can be accomplished, better understand how events are related to one another, and focus attention on the most critical elements of the process under study or investigation.

The Method

The process is straightforward.

Compile a list of specific activities, steps, or events related to the event under study. Determine which must precede others, which must follow others, and which can operate independently. Draw a chart using circles or boxes to show activities and arrows to illustrate sequencing.

Different shapes of boxes can designate different types of activities. For example, activities are often represented by a rectangular box, decisions by a diamond, and input/output by a parallelogram. 4 The thickness of the arrows can illustrate the volume of information moving from one activity to another.

In a Process Map, the steps in the process are diagrammed sequentially with various symbols. Diagrams can be created with readily available software such as Microsoft Visio. When constructing or evaluating a Flow Chart, ask yourself whether it makes complex issues easier to understand, is valid and appropriately sourced, and provides titles and labels that are accurate and clear.

Example

Figure 5.4 shows the process that drug traffickers use to launder their profits from the drugs they distribute. The drug network leader provides the $1 million he receives from users to a drug mule who deposits it in an offshore bank account. The money is deposited in the bank account of a foreign corporation, which takes its 15 percent cut for laundering the money. The remaining $850,000 then is transmitted back to the drug network leader.

Figure 5.4 Commodity Flow Chart of Laundering Drug Money

Origins of This Technique

The first-known "flow process charts" were presented to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1921. 5 They quickly became a tool of industrial engineering and were adopted by computer programmers beginning in the mid-century to describe computer algorithms. Information on how to use various types of Process Mapping is available in Richard Damelio, The Basics of Process Mapping (Florence, KY: Productivity Press, 2006).

5.5 Gantt Charts

A Gantt Chart is a specific type of Process Map that was developed to facilitate the planning, scheduling, and management of complex industrial projects.

When to Use It

Intelligence analysts use Gantt Charts to track, understand, and monitor the progress of activities of intelligence interest undertaken by a foreign government, a criminal or terrorist group, or any other non-state actor. For example, a Gantt Chart can be used for the following:

Monitor progress in developing a new weapons system, preparations for a major military action, or the execution of any other major plan that involves a sequence of observable steps. Identify and describe the modus operandi of a criminal or terrorist group, including the preparatory steps that such a group typically takes prior to a major action. Describe and monitor the process of radicalization by which a normal youth may be transformed over time into a terrorist. Trace how information or a report flows through an intelligence community's collection and processing system until it arrives at the desk of the analyst—and how it might have been corrupted by a bad translation or an overgeneralization when the actual event or initial statement was inaccurately summarized along the way.

Value Added

The process of constructing a Gantt Chart helps analysts think clearly about what someone else needs to do to complete a complex project. When an adversary's plan or process is understood well enough to be diagrammed or charted, analysts can then answer questions such as the following: What are they doing? How far along are they? What do they still need to do? What resources will they need to do it? How much time do we have before they have this capability? Is there any vulnerable point in this process for stopping or slowing activity?

The Gantt Chart is a visual aid for communicating this information to the client. If there is sufficient information, the analyst's understanding of the process will lead to a set of indicators that can be used to monitor the status of an ongoing plan or project.

The Method

A Gantt Chart is a matrix that lists tasks in a project or steps in a process down the far-left column, with the estimated time period for accomplishing these tasks or steps in weeks, months, or years across the top row. For each task or step, a horizontal line or bar shows the beginning and ending of the time period for that task or step. Professionals working with Gantt Charts use tools such as Microsoft Project to draw the chart. Gantt Charts can also be made with Microsoft Excel or by hand on graph paper.

Detailed guidance on creating a Gantt Chart is readily available from the sources described under "Origins of This Technique."

Example

The U.S. Intelligence Community has considerable experience monitoring terrorist groups. This example describes how an analyst would create a Gantt Chart of a generic terrorist attack–planning process (see Figure 5.5 ). The analyst starts by making a list of all the tasks that terrorists must complete, estimating the schedule for when each task will start and finish, and determining what resources are needed for each task. Some tasks need to be performed in a sequence, with each task somewhat completed before the next activity can begin. These are called sequential, or linear, activities. Other activities are not dependent upon completion of any other tasks. These may be done at any time before or after a stage occurs. These are called nondependent, or parallel, tasks.

Note whether each terrorist task is sequential or parallel. It is this sequencing of dependent and nondependent activities that is critical in determining how long a project or process will take. The more activities worked in parallel, the greater the chances of a project being completed on time. The more tasks done sequentially, the greater the chances of a single bottleneck delaying the entire project.

When entering tasks into the Gantt Chart, enter the sequential tasks first in the required sequence. Ensure that those tasks don't start until the tasks on which they depend are completed. Then enter the parallel tasks in an appropriate time frame toward the bottom of the matrix so that they do not interfere with the sequential tasks on the critical path to completion of the project.

Gantt Charts that map a generic process can also track data about a more specific process as it is received. For example, the Gantt Chart depicted in Figure 5.5 can be used as a template over which new information about a specific group's activities could be layered using a different color or line type. Layering in the specific data allows an analyst to compare what is expected with the actual data. The chart can then identify and narrow gaps or anomalies in the data and even identify and challenge assumptions about what is expected or what is happening. The analytic significance of considering such possibilities can mean the difference between anticipating an attack and wrongly assuming a lack of activity means a lack of intent. The matrix illuminates the gap and prompts the analyst to consider various explanations.

Origins of This Technique

The first Gantt Chart was devised in the mid-1890s by Karol Adamiecki, a Polish engineer who ran a steelworks in southern Poland. 6 Some fifteen years later, Henry Gantt, an American engineer and project management consultant, created his own version of the chart. His chart soon became popular in Western countries, and Henry Gantt's name became associated with this type of chart. Gantt Charts were a revolutionary advance in the early 1900s. During the period of industrial development, they were used to plan industrial processes and still are in common use today. Information on how to create and use Gantt Charts is available at www.ganttchart.com and https://www.projectmanager.com/gantt-chart .

The mechanisms of engagement, ranging from conflict to cooperation are use of military force, policing or monitoring, and collaboration. Use of military force: Threat or use of military force to impose or to defend the national interest. Policing or monitoring: Peacekeeping treaties etcetera that maintain order with penalties for noncompliance. Collaboration: Self-enforcing agreements, voluntary standards. The source of threat, ranging from nation states to non-state actors are nation stations, subnational actors, organizations, informal networks, and systematic challenges. Nation States: Countries, alliances, and ad hoc coalitions. Subnational actors: Ethnic groups, guerrilla groups, and refugees. Organizations: Transnational criminal organization, terrorist groups, international businesses, and NGOs. Informal networks: Antiglobalization protestors, currency speculators, computer hackers, and migrants. Systematic Challenges: Infectious diseases, natural disasters, and global warming.

Use of military force by nation states: Iraq in 1990 and 2003, Afghanistan in 2002, and Somalia antipiracy operations. Use of military force by subnational actors: Kosovo in 1998, Afghanistan in 2009, and noncombatant evacuation operations. Use of military force by organizations: Afghanistan drug eradication, Mexican and Colombian drug wars, and Osama bin laden in Pakistan. Use of military force by informal networks: Information warfare, and U.S. maritime interception of Haitian and Cuban immigrants. Use of military force by systematic challenges: Asteroid tracking, and Guam Brown Tree Snake quarantine.

Policing and monitoring by nation states: EU peacekeeping in Bosnia, UN peacekeeping operations, and nonproliferation treaties. Policing and monitoring by subnational actors: Congo refugees, Somalia, and Gaza. Policing and monitoring by organizations: INTERPOL, security at Olympics, and World Trade Organization. Policing and monitoring by informal networks: International currency, exchange protocols, and international criminal court. Policing and monitoring by systematic challenges: Montreal Protocol on CFCs, World Health Organizations, and Kyoto Protocols.

Collaboration by nation states: G-8 and G-20 summits, CSCE Istanbul Summit in 1999, and bio weapons convention. Collaboration by subnational actors: Irish peace resolution and implementation, and US state department relief web. Collaboration by organization: INTERPOL information technology working parties and international relief such as Red Cross. Collaboration by informal networks: Global internet virus monitoring, international standards for genetic research, and internet domain names. Collaboration by systematic challenges: H1N1 pandemic monitoring in 2009, HIV AIDS suppression, and volcano monitoring.

A spectrum ranges from collecting and protecting intelligence secrets by nation states, to collecting information and disseminating broadly by collaboration. Use of military force by nation states is a classic concept of national security. Use of military force by subnational actors and organization, and policing and monitoring by nation states, subnational actors, and organization are in enlarged focus of the past two decades. The rest are gaining importance in globalizing world.

The gantt chart shows bars across different time periods before the day of attack for different activities. Intent, such as conceiving the idea, meetings, and deciding to act, takes place two years before attack. Planning, such as gathering information, surveilling, recruiting, and making bombs, takes place between two years to one year before the day of attack. The time period for various activities associated with preparation is as follows. Training: One year to six months before the day of attack. Surveilling: Six months before the day of attack to the day. Assembling the material: Six months to eight to four weeks before the day of attack. Issuing attack order: On the day of attack. Attack, such as positioning and detonating the bomb, takes place on the day of the attack. The aftermath, such as fleeing the scene and claiming credit, takes place on the day of the attack or on the day after.
