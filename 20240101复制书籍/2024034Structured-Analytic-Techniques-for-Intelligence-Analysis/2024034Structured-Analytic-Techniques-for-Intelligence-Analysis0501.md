## 0501. Getting Organized

A significant challenge analysts face is managing the large volume of data that must be processed and evaluated to develop an analytic line and generate a well-sourced, high-quality product. Most people can keep only a limited amount of information in the forefront of their minds. Imagine that a person must make a difficult decision, such as what car to buy or where to go on vacation. A good first step is to make a list of all the relevant information and arguments for or against taking an action. When it comes time to make the decision, however, the list may be so long that weighing all the pros against the cons at the same time becomes a daunting task. As a result, the person is likely to vacillate, focusing first on the pros and then on the cons, favoring first one decision and then the other. Suppose how much more difficult it would be for an analyst to think through a complex intelligence problem with large volumes of data and many interacting variables. The limitations of human thought make it difficult, if not impossible, to do error-free analysis without the support of some external representation of the parts of the problem at hand.

Two common approaches for coping with this limitation of our working memory are as follows:

Decomposition , which is breaking down the problem or issue into its component parts so that each part can be considered separately Visualization , which is capturing all the parts of the problem or issue in some organized manner, often a visual representation, that is designed to facilitate understanding how the various parts interrelate

All Structured Analytic Techniques employ these approaches, as the externalization of one's thinking is part of the definition of structured analysis. For some of the simpler techniques, however, decomposing an issue to present the data in an organized manner is the principal contribution they make to producing more effective analysis.

The use of a simple checklist can be extremely productive in getting organized at the start of a project. 1 In Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence , Pherson and Pherson discuss how the use of checklists and critical-thinking mnemonics such as the Knowing Your Client Checklist, Getting Started Checklist, AIMS ( A udience, I ssue, M essage, and S toryline), and Issue Redefinition can aid the process. 2 These techniques can be combined to help analysts conceptualize and launch a new project. Critical time can be saved if an analyst can start off in the right direction and avoid having to change course later.

In this chapter, we describe five basic approaches to organizing your data and getting started with your analysis.

Analysis is breaking information down into its component parts. Anything that has parts also has a structure that relates these parts to each other. One of the first steps in doing analysis is to determine an appropriate structure for the analytic problem, so that one can then identify the various parts and begin assembling information on them. Because there are many different kinds of analytic problems, there are also many different ways to structure analysis.

Overview of Techniques

Sorting is a basic technique for organizing data in a manner that often yields new insights. It is particularly effective during initial data gathering and hypothesis generation.

Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing techniques are used to organize items on any list according to the item's importance, desirability, priority, value, or probability of happening.

Matrices are generic analytic tools for sorting and organizing data in a manner that facilitates comparison and analysis. They are used to analyze the relationships among any two sets of variables or the interrelationships among a single set of variables. A matrix consists of a grid with as many cells as needed for the problem under study. Matrices are used so frequently to analyze a problem that we have included several distinct techniques in this book.

Process Maps are used to identify and diagram each step in a complex process. Many different versions exist, including Event Flow Charts, Activity Flow Charts, and Value Stream Maps. Analysts can use the techniques to track the progress of plans or projects undertaken by a business competitor, foreign government, a criminal or terrorist group, or any other non-state actor.

Gantt Charts are a specific type of Process Map that uses a matrix to chart the progression of a multifaceted process over a specific time period. Process Maps and Gantt Charts were developed primarily for use in business and the military, but they are also useful to intelligence analysts.

Other comparable techniques for organizing and presenting data include various types of graphs, diagrams, and trees. We did not discuss them in this book because they are well covered in other works, and it was necessary to draw a line on the number of techniques included here.

5.1 Sorting

Sorting is a basic technique for organizing a large body of data in a manner that often yields new insights.

When to Use It

Sorting is effective when information elements can be broken out into categories or subcategories for comparison with one another, most often by using a computer program, such as a spreadsheet. This technique is particularly useful during the initial data-gathering and hypothesis-generation phases of analysis.

Value Added

Sorting large amounts of data into relevant categories that are compared with one another can provide analysts with insights into trends, similarities, differences, or abnormalities that otherwise would go unnoticed. When you are dealing with transactional data in particular (for example, geospatial information or transfers of goods or money), it is helpful—if not essential—to sort the data first.

The Method

Follow these steps:

Review the categories of information to determine which category or combination of categories might show trends or abnormalities that would provide insight into the problem you are studying. Use a structured brainstorming technique, such as Cluster Brainstorming or Outside-In Thinking, to ensure you have generated a comprehensive list of categories. Place the data into a spreadsheet or a database using as many fields (columns) as necessary to differentiate among the data types (dates, times, locations, people, activities, amounts, etc.). List each of the facts, pieces of information, or hypotheses involved in the problem that are relevant to your sorting schema. (Use paper, whiteboard, movable self-stick notes, or other means for this.) Review the listed facts, information, or hypotheses in the database or spreadsheet to identify key fields that may allow you to uncover possible patterns or groupings. Those patterns or groupings then illustrate the schema categories that deserve the most attention. For example, if an examination of terrorist activity shows that most attacks occur in hotels and restaurants but that the time of day of the attack varies, "Location" and "Time of Day" become key categories. Choose a category and sort the data within that category. Look for any insights, trends, or oddities. Good analysts notice trends; great analysts notice anomalies. Review (or ask others to review) the sorted facts, information, or hypotheses to see if there are alternative ways to sort them. List any alternative sorting schema for your problem. One of the most useful applications for this technique is to sort according to multiple schemas and examine results for correlations between data and categories. But remember that correlation is not the same as causation.

Examples

Example 1: Are a foreign adversary's military leaders pro-United States, anti-United States, or neutral on their attitudes toward U.S. policy in the Middle East? To answer this question, analysts sort the leaders by various factors that might give insight into the issue, such as birthplace, native language, religion, level of professional education, foreign military or civilian/university exchange training (where/when), field/command assignments by parent service, political influences in life, and political decisions made. Then analysts review the information to see if any parallels exist among the categories.

Example 2: Analysts review the data from cell-phone communications among five conspirators to determine the frequency of calls, patterns that show who is calling whom, changes in patterns of frequency of calls prior to a planned activity, dates and times of calls, and subjects discussed.

Example 3: Analysts are reviewing all information related to an adversary's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. Electronic intelligence reporting shows more than 300,000 emitter transmissions were collected over the past year alone. The analysts' sorting of the data by type of emitter, dates of emission, and location shows varying increases and decreases of emitter activity with some minor trends identifiable. The analysts filter out all collections except those related to air defense. The unfiltered information is sorted by type of air defense system, location, and dates of activity.

Of note is a period when there is an unexpectedly large increase of activity in the air defense surveillance and early warning systems. The analysts review relevant external events and find that a major opposition movement outside the country held a news conference where it detailed the adversary's WMD activities, including locations of the activity within the country. The air defense emitters for all suspected locations of WMD activity, including several not included in the press conference, increased to a war level of surveillance within four hours of the press conference. The analysts reviewed all air defense activity locations that showed the increase assumed to be related to the press conference and the WMD program and found two locations showing increased activity but not previously listed as WMD-related. These new locations were added to collection planning to determine what relationship, if any, they had to the WMD program.

Potential Pitfalls

Improper sorting can hide valuable insights as easily as it can illuminate them. Standardizing the data being sorted is imperative. Working with an analyst who has experience in sorting can help you avoid this pitfall.

Origins of This Technique

Sorting is a long-established procedure for organizing data. The description in this chapter is from Military Intelligence training materials.

5.2 Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing

This section provides guidance for using three different ranking techniques—Ranked Voting, Paired Comparison, and Weighted Ranking. Combining an Exploration Technique, such as Cluster Brainstorming, with a ranking technique is an effective way for an analyst to start a new project. Brainstorming techniques are helpful in developing lists of driving forces, variables for consideration, indicators, possible scenarios, important players, historical precedents, sources of information, questions to be answered, and so forth. Such lists are even more useful once they are ranked, scored, or prioritized to determine which items are most important, most useful, most likely, or should be at the top of the priority list.

When to Use It

A ranking technique is often the next step following the use of a structured brainstorming technique, such as Cluster Brainstorming, Mind Maps, or Nominal Group Technique (see chapter 6 ). A ranking technique is appropriate whenever there are too many items to rank easily just by looking at the list, the ranking has significant consequences and must be done as accurately as possible, or it is useful to aggregate the opinions of a group of analysts.

Value Added

A Getting Organized technique is often used to develop lists of critical events, key factors, variables to be considered, or important players. By ranking, scoring, and prioritizing such lists, analysts can determine which items are most important, most useful, most probable, and require immediate action. Combining a brainstorming technique with a ranking technique is an excellent way for an analyst to provide a foundation for collaboration within or external to an office.

The Method

Of the three methods discussed here, Ranked Voting is the easiest and quickest to use, and it is often good enough. However, it is not as accurate after you get past the top two or three ranked items, because the group usually has not thought as much (and may not care as much) about the lower-ranked items. Ranked Voting also provides less information than either Paired Comparison or Weighted Ranking. Ranked Voting shows only that one item is ranked higher or lower than another; it does not show how much higher or lower. Paired Comparison does provide this information; Weighted Ranking provides even more information. It specifies the criteria used in making the ranking, and weights are assigned to those criteria for each of the items in the list.

5.2.1 The Method: Ranked Voting

In a Ranked Voting exercise, members of the group individually rank each item in order according to the member's preference or what the member regards as the item's importance. Depending upon the number of items or the specific analytic needs, the group can decide to rank all the items or only the top three to five. The group leader or facilitator passes out simple ballots listing all the items to be voted on. Each member votes his or her order of preference. If a member views two items as being of equal preference, the votes can be split between them. For example, if two items are tied for second place, each receives a 2.5 ranking (by taking the average of 2 and 3). Any items that are not voted on fall to the bottom of the ranking list. After members of the group have voted, the votes are added up. The item with the lowest number is ranked number 1.

5.2.2 The Method: Paired Comparison

Paired Comparison compares each item against every other item, and the analyst can assign a score to show how much more important, preferable, or probable one item is than the others. This technique provides more than a simple ranking, as it shows the degree of importance or preference for each item. The list of items can then be ordered along a dimension, such as importance or preference, using an interval-type scale.

Follow these steps to use the technique:

List the items to be compared. Assign a letter to each item. Create a table with the letters across the top and down the left side, as in Figure 5.2a . The results of the comparison of each pair of items are marked in the cells of this table. Note the diagonal line of darker-colored cells. These cells are not used, as each item is never compared with itself. The cells below this diagonal line are not used because they would duplicate a comparison in the cells above the diagonal line. If you are working in a group, distribute a blank copy of this table to each participant. Looking at the cells above the diagonal row of darkened cells, compare the item in the row with the one in the column. For each cell, decide which of the two items is more important (or preferable or probable). Write the letter of the winner of this comparison in the cell, and score the degree of difference on a scale from 0 (no difference) to 3 (major difference), as in Figure 5.2a .

Description Figure 5.2A Paired Comparison Matrix Consolidate the results by adding up the total of all the values for each letter and put this number in the "Score" column. For example, in Figure 5.2a , item B has one 3 in the first row, plus one 2 and two 1s in the second row, for a score of 7. Finally, it may be desirable to convert these values into a percentage of the total score. To do this, divide the total number of scores (20 in the example) by the score for each individual item. Item B, with a score of 7, is ranked most important or most preferred. Item B received a score of 35 percent (7 divided by 20), as compared with 25 percent for item D and only 5 percent each for items C and E, which received only one vote each. This example shows how Paired Comparison captures the degree of difference between each ranking. To aggregate rankings received from a group of analysts, simply add the individual scores for each analyst.

5.2.3 The Method: Weighted Ranking

In Weighted Ranking, a specified set of criteria is used to rank items. The analyst creates a table with items to be ranked listed across the top row and criteria for ranking these items listed down the far-left column (see Figure 5.2b ). There are a variety of valid ways to conduct this ranking. We have chosen to present a simple version of Weighted Ranking here because analysts usually are making subjective judgments rather than dealing with hard numbers. As you read the following steps, refer to Figure 5.2b :

Create a table with one column for each item. At the head of each column, write the name of an item or assign it a letter to save space. Add two more blank columns on the left side of this table. Count the number of selection criteria, and then adjust the table so that it has that number of rows plus three more, one at the top to list the items and two at the bottom to show the raw scores and percentages for each item. In the first column on the left side, starting with the second row, write in all the selection criteria down the left side of the table. There is some value in listing the criteria roughly in order of importance, but that is not critical. Leave the bottom two rows blank for the scores and percentages. Now work down the second column, assigning weights to the selection criteria based on their relative importance for judging the ranking of the items. Depending on how many criteria are listed, take either 10 points or 100 points and divide these points among the selection criteria based on what the analysts believe to be their relative importance in ranking the items. In other words, decide what percentage of the decision should be based on each of these criteria. Be sure that the weights for all the selection criteria combined add up to either 10 or 100, whichever is selected. The criteria should be phrased in such a way that a higher weight is more desirable. For example, a proper phrase would be "ability to adapt to changing conditions," and an improper phrase would be "sensitivity to changing conditions," which does not indicate whether the entity reacts well or poorly. Work across the rows to write the criterion weight in the left side of each cell. Next, work across the matrix one row (selection criterion) at a time to evaluate the relative ability of each of the items to satisfy that selection criteria. Use a ten-point rating scale, where 1 = low and 10 = high, to rate each item separately. (Do not spread the ten points proportionately across all the items as was done to assign weights to the criteria.) Write this rating number after the criterion weight in the cell for each item. Again, work across the matrix one row at a time to multiply the criterion weight by the item rating for that criterion, and enter this number for each cell, as shown in Figure 5.2b .

Figure 5.2B Weighted Ranking Matrix Now add the columns for all the items. The result will be a ranking of the items from highest to lowest score. To gain a better understanding of the relative ranking of one item as compared with another, convert these raw scores to percentages. To do this, first add together all the scores in the "Totals" row to get a total number. Then divide the score for each item by this total score to get a percentage ranking for each item. All the percentages together must add up to 100 percent. In Figure 5.2b , it is apparent that item B has the number one ranking (with 20.3 percent), while item E has the lowest (with 13.2 percent).

Potential Pitfalls

When any of these techniques is used to aggregate the opinions of a group of analysts, the rankings provided by each group member are totaled and averaged. This means that the opinions of the outliers, whose views are quite different from the others, are blended into the average. As a result, the ranking does not show the range of different opinions that might be present in a group. In some cases, the identification of outliers with a minority opinion can be of great value. Further research might show that the outliers are correct.

Relationship to Other Techniques

Some form of ranking, scoring, or prioritizing is commonly used with Cluster Brainstorming, Mind Mapping, Nominal Group Technique, and the Decision Matrix, all of which generate ideas that should be evaluated or prioritized. Applications of the Delphi Method may also generate ideas from outside experts that need to be evaluated or prioritized.

Origins of This Technique

Ranking, Scoring, and Prioritizing are common analytic processes in many fields. All three forms of ranking described here are based largely on internet sources. For Ranked Voting, we referred to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system ; for Paired Comparison, http://www.mindtools.com ; and for Weighted Ranking, www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/dstools/choosing/criter.html .

5.3 Matrices

A matrix is an analytic tool for sorting and organizing data in a manner that facilitates comparison and analysis. It consists of a simple grid with as many cells as needed for the problem being analyzed.

Some analytic topics or problems that use a matrix occur so frequently that they are handled in this book as separate techniques. For example:

Gantt Charts (this chapter) use a matrix to analyze the relationships between tasks to be accomplished and the time period for those tasks. Paired Comparisons (this chapter) uses a matrix to record the relationships between pairs of items. Weighted Ranking (this chapter) uses a matrix to analyze the relationships between specific items and criteria for judging those items. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses and the Inconsistencies Finder™ ( chapter 7 ) use a matrix to analyze the relationships between relevant information and hypotheses. Cross-Impact Matrix ( chapter 7 ) uses a matrix to analyze the interactions among variables or driving forces that will determine an outcome. Such a Cross-Impact Matrix is part of Complexity Manager ( chapter 10 ). Indicators Evaluation ( chapter 9 ) uses a matrix to evaluate the uniqueness or diagnostic power of indicators when compared across scenarios. Opportunities Incubator™ ( chapter 10 ) uses a matrix to inform decision makers of which actions would be most effective in preventing a negative scenario from occurring or fostering the emergence of a good scenario. Decision Matrix ( chapter 10 ) uses a matrix to analyze the relationships between goals or preferences and decision options. The Impact Matrix ( chapter 10 ) uses a matrix to chart the impact a new policy or decision is likely to have on key players and how best to manage that impact.

When to Use It

Matrices are used to analyze the relationships between any two sets of variables or the interrelationships between a single set of variables. Among other things, matrices enable analysts to

compare one type of information with another, compare pieces of information of the same type, categorize information by type, identify patterns in the information, separate elements of a problem.

A matrix is such an easy and flexible tool to use that it should be one of the first tools analysts think of when dealing with a large body of data. One limiting factor in the use of matrices is that information must be organized along only two dimensions.

Value Added

Matrices provide a visual representation of a complex set of data. By presenting information visually, a matrix enables analysts to deal effectively with more data than they could manage by juggling various pieces of information in their head. The analytic problem is broken down into component parts so that each part (that is, each cell in the matrix) can be analyzed separately, while ideally maintaining the context of the problem in its entirety.

A matrix can also help establish an analytic framework for understanding a problem, to suggest a more rigorous structure for explaining a phenomenon, or to generate a more comprehensive set of alternatives.

The Method

A matrix can be used in many different ways and for many different purposes. What matrices have in common is that each has a grid with columns and rows for entering two sets of data for comparison. Organize the category headings for each set of data in some logical sequence before entering the headings for one set of data in the top row and the headings for the other set in the far-left column. Then enter the data in the appropriate cells.

Figure 5.3 , "Rethinking the Concept of National Security: A New Ecology," is an example of a complex matrix that not only organizes data but also tells its own analytic story. 3 It shows how the concept of national security has evolved over recent decades and suggests that the way we define national security will continue to expand in the coming years. In this matrix, threats to national security are arrayed along the vertical axis, beginning at the top with the most traditional actor, the nation-state. At the bottom end of the spectrum are systemic threats, such as infectious diseases or threats that "have no face." The top row of the matrix presents the three primary mechanisms for dealing with threats: military force, policing and monitoring, and collaboration. The cells in the matrix provide historic examples of how the three different mechanisms of engagement have dealt with the five different sources of threats. The top-left cell (dark color) presents the classic case of using military force to resolve nation-state differences. In contrast, at the bottom-right corner, various actors deal with systemic threats, such as the outbreak of a pandemic, by collaborating with one another.

Description Figure 5.3 Rethinking the Concept of National Security: A New Ecology Source: Pherson Associates, LLC, 2019.

Classic definitions of national security focus on the potential for conflicts involving nation-states. The top-left cell lists three military operations. In recent decades, the threat has expanded to include threats posed by subnational actors as well as terrorist and other criminal organizations. Similarly, the use of peacekeeping and international policing has become more common than in the past. This shift to a broader use of the term "national security" is represented by the other five cells (medium color) in the top left of the matrix. The remaining cells (light color) to the right and at the bottom of the matrix represent how the concept of national security is continuing to expand as the world becomes increasingly globalized.

By using a matrix to present the expanding concept of national security in this way, one sees that patterns relating to how key players collect intelligence and share information vary along the two primary dimensions. In the upper left of Figure 5.3 , the practice of nation-states is to seek intelligence on their adversaries, classify it, and protect it. As one moves diagonally across the matrix to the lower right, this practice reverses. In the lower right of this figure, information is usually available from unclassified sources and the imperative is to disseminate it to everyone as soon as possible. This dynamic can create serious tensions at the midpoint, for example, when those working in the homeland security arena must find ways to share sensitive national security information with state and local law enforcement officers.

Origins of This Technique

The description of this basic and widely used technique is from Pherson Associates, LLC, training materials. The national security matrix was developed by Randolph H. Pherson.

5.4 Process Maps

Process Mapping is an umbrella term that covers a variety of procedures for identifying and depicting the steps in a complex procedure. It includes Flow Charts of various types (Activity Flow Charts, Commodity Flow Charts, Causal Flow Charts), Relationship Maps, and Value Stream Maps commonly used to assess and plan improvements for business and industrial processes. Process Maps or Flow Charts are diagrams that analysts use to track the step-by-step movement of events or commodities to identify key pathways and relationships involved in a complex system or activity. They usually contain various types of boxes connected by lines. The boxes are connected by arrows to illustrate the flow direction of a process.

When to Use It

Flow Charts can track the flow of money and other commodities, the movement of goods through production and delivery, the sequencing of events, or a decision-making process. They help analysts document, study, plan, and communicate complex processes with simple, easy-to-understand diagrams. In law enforcement and intelligence, they are used widely to map criminal and terrorist activity.

Value Added

Flow Charts can identify critical pathways and choke points and discover unknown relationships. In law enforcement, they help analysts probe the meaning of various activities, identify alternative ways a task can be accomplished, better understand how events are related to one another, and focus attention on the most critical elements of the process under study or investigation.

The Method

The process is straightforward.

Compile a list of specific activities, steps, or events related to the event under study. Determine which must precede others, which must follow others, and which can operate independently. Draw a chart using circles or boxes to show activities and arrows to illustrate sequencing.

Different shapes of boxes can designate different types of activities. For example, activities are often represented by a rectangular box, decisions by a diamond, and input/output by a parallelogram. 4 The thickness of the arrows can illustrate the volume of information moving from one activity to another.

In a Process Map, the steps in the process are diagrammed sequentially with various symbols. Diagrams can be created with readily available software such as Microsoft Visio. When constructing or evaluating a Flow Chart, ask yourself whether it makes complex issues easier to understand, is valid and appropriately sourced, and provides titles and labels that are accurate and clear.

Example

Figure 5.4 shows the process that drug traffickers use to launder their profits from the drugs they distribute. The drug network leader provides the $1 million he receives from users to a drug mule who deposits it in an offshore bank account. The money is deposited in the bank account of a foreign corporation, which takes its 15 percent cut for laundering the money. The remaining $850,000 then is transmitted back to the drug network leader.

Figure 5.4 Commodity Flow Chart of Laundering Drug Money

Origins of This Technique

The first-known "flow process charts" were presented to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1921. 5 They quickly became a tool of industrial engineering and were adopted by computer programmers beginning in the mid-century to describe computer algorithms. Information on how to use various types of Process Mapping is available in Richard Damelio, The Basics of Process Mapping (Florence, KY: Productivity Press, 2006).

5.5 Gantt Charts

A Gantt Chart is a specific type of Process Map that was developed to facilitate the planning, scheduling, and management of complex industrial projects.

When to Use It

Intelligence analysts use Gantt Charts to track, understand, and monitor the progress of activities of intelligence interest undertaken by a foreign government, a criminal or terrorist group, or any other non-state actor. For example, a Gantt Chart can be used for the following:

Monitor progress in developing a new weapons system, preparations for a major military action, or the execution of any other major plan that involves a sequence of observable steps. Identify and describe the modus operandi of a criminal or terrorist group, including the preparatory steps that such a group typically takes prior to a major action. Describe and monitor the process of radicalization by which a normal youth may be transformed over time into a terrorist. Trace how information or a report flows through an intelligence community's collection and processing system until it arrives at the desk of the analyst—and how it might have been corrupted by a bad translation or an overgeneralization when the actual event or initial statement was inaccurately summarized along the way.

Value Added

The process of constructing a Gantt Chart helps analysts think clearly about what someone else needs to do to complete a complex project. When an adversary's plan or process is understood well enough to be diagrammed or charted, analysts can then answer questions such as the following: What are they doing? How far along are they? What do they still need to do? What resources will they need to do it? How much time do we have before they have this capability? Is there any vulnerable point in this process for stopping or slowing activity?

The Gantt Chart is a visual aid for communicating this information to the client. If there is sufficient information, the analyst's understanding of the process will lead to a set of indicators that can be used to monitor the status of an ongoing plan or project.

The Method

A Gantt Chart is a matrix that lists tasks in a project or steps in a process down the far-left column, with the estimated time period for accomplishing these tasks or steps in weeks, months, or years across the top row. For each task or step, a horizontal line or bar shows the beginning and ending of the time period for that task or step. Professionals working with Gantt Charts use tools such as Microsoft Project to draw the chart. Gantt Charts can also be made with Microsoft Excel or by hand on graph paper.

Detailed guidance on creating a Gantt Chart is readily available from the sources described under "Origins of This Technique."

Example

The U.S. Intelligence Community has considerable experience monitoring terrorist groups. This example describes how an analyst would create a Gantt Chart of a generic terrorist attack–planning process (see Figure 5.5 ). The analyst starts by making a list of all the tasks that terrorists must complete, estimating the schedule for when each task will start and finish, and determining what resources are needed for each task. Some tasks need to be performed in a sequence, with each task somewhat completed before the next activity can begin. These are called sequential, or linear, activities. Other activities are not dependent upon completion of any other tasks. These may be done at any time before or after a stage occurs. These are called nondependent, or parallel, tasks.

Note whether each terrorist task is sequential or parallel. It is this sequencing of dependent and nondependent activities that is critical in determining how long a project or process will take. The more activities worked in parallel, the greater the chances of a project being completed on time. The more tasks done sequentially, the greater the chances of a single bottleneck delaying the entire project.

When entering tasks into the Gantt Chart, enter the sequential tasks first in the required sequence. Ensure that those tasks don't start until the tasks on which they depend are completed. Then enter the parallel tasks in an appropriate time frame toward the bottom of the matrix so that they do not interfere with the sequential tasks on the critical path to completion of the project.

Gantt Charts that map a generic process can also track data about a more specific process as it is received. For example, the Gantt Chart depicted in Figure 5.5 can be used as a template over which new information about a specific group's activities could be layered using a different color or line type. Layering in the specific data allows an analyst to compare what is expected with the actual data. The chart can then identify and narrow gaps or anomalies in the data and even identify and challenge assumptions about what is expected or what is happening. The analytic significance of considering such possibilities can mean the difference between anticipating an attack and wrongly assuming a lack of activity means a lack of intent. The matrix illuminates the gap and prompts the analyst to consider various explanations.

Origins of This Technique

The first Gantt Chart was devised in the mid-1890s by Karol Adamiecki, a Polish engineer who ran a steelworks in southern Poland. 6 Some fifteen years later, Henry Gantt, an American engineer and project management consultant, created his own version of the chart. His chart soon became popular in Western countries, and Henry Gantt's name became associated with this type of chart. Gantt Charts were a revolutionary advance in the early 1900s. During the period of industrial development, they were used to plan industrial processes and still are in common use today. Information on how to create and use Gantt Charts is available at www.ganttchart.com and https://www.projectmanager.com/gantt-chart .

The mechanisms of engagement, ranging from conflict to cooperation are use of military force, policing or monitoring, and collaboration. Use of military force: Threat or use of military force to impose or to defend the national interest. Policing or monitoring: Peacekeeping treaties etcetera that maintain order with penalties for noncompliance. Collaboration: Self-enforcing agreements, voluntary standards. The source of threat, ranging from nation states to non-state actors are nation stations, subnational actors, organizations, informal networks, and systematic challenges. Nation States: Countries, alliances, and ad hoc coalitions. Subnational actors: Ethnic groups, guerrilla groups, and refugees. Organizations: Transnational criminal organization, terrorist groups, international businesses, and NGOs. Informal networks: Antiglobalization protestors, currency speculators, computer hackers, and migrants. Systematic Challenges: Infectious diseases, natural disasters, and global warming.

Use of military force by nation states: Iraq in 1990 and 2003, Afghanistan in 2002, and Somalia antipiracy operations. Use of military force by subnational actors: Kosovo in 1998, Afghanistan in 2009, and noncombatant evacuation operations. Use of military force by organizations: Afghanistan drug eradication, Mexican and Colombian drug wars, and Osama bin laden in Pakistan. Use of military force by informal networks: Information warfare, and U.S. maritime interception of Haitian and Cuban immigrants. Use of military force by systematic challenges: Asteroid tracking, and Guam Brown Tree Snake quarantine.

Policing and monitoring by nation states: EU peacekeeping in Bosnia, UN peacekeeping operations, and nonproliferation treaties. Policing and monitoring by subnational actors: Congo refugees, Somalia, and Gaza. Policing and monitoring by organizations: INTERPOL, security at Olympics, and World Trade Organization. Policing and monitoring by informal networks: International currency, exchange protocols, and international criminal court. Policing and monitoring by systematic challenges: Montreal Protocol on CFCs, World Health Organizations, and Kyoto Protocols.

Collaboration by nation states: G-8 and G-20 summits, CSCE Istanbul Summit in 1999, and bio weapons convention. Collaboration by subnational actors: Irish peace resolution and implementation, and US state department relief web. Collaboration by organization: INTERPOL information technology working parties and international relief such as Red Cross. Collaboration by informal networks: Global internet virus monitoring, international standards for genetic research, and internet domain names. Collaboration by systematic challenges: H1N1 pandemic monitoring in 2009, HIV AIDS suppression, and volcano monitoring.

A spectrum ranges from collecting and protecting intelligence secrets by nation states, to collecting information and disseminating broadly by collaboration. Use of military force by nation states is a classic concept of national security. Use of military force by subnational actors and organization, and policing and monitoring by nation states, subnational actors, and organization are in enlarged focus of the past two decades. The rest are gaining importance in globalizing world.

The gantt chart shows bars across different time periods before the day of attack for different activities. Intent, such as conceiving the idea, meetings, and deciding to act, takes place two years before attack. Planning, such as gathering information, surveilling, recruiting, and making bombs, takes place between two years to one year before the day of attack. The time period for various activities associated with preparation is as follows. Training: One year to six months before the day of attack. Surveilling: Six months before the day of attack to the day. Assembling the material: Six months to eight to four weeks before the day of attack. Issuing attack order: On the day of attack. Attack, such as positioning and detonating the bomb, takes place on the day of the attack. The aftermath, such as fleeing the scene and claiming credit, takes place on the day of the attack or on the day after.

0501 组织管理

分析师面临的一大挑战是如何处理和评估大量数据，以便制定分析策略并产出有充分依据、高质量的分析报告。人类的思维能力有限，难以同时处理大量信息。设想一个人在做出重要决策时，比如选择购买哪款汽车或规划度假目的地，首先会列出所有相关信息和正反两方面的论点。然而，当面对长长的决策清单时，同时权衡所有利弊变得异常困难，导致决策者犹豫不决，时而倾向于一个选项，时而又改变主意。对于分析师而言，面对复杂的情报问题，涉及海量数据和众多相互作用的变量，这种挑战更为严峻。人类思维的局限性意味着，没有外部工具辅助，要进行无误的分析几乎是不可能的。

为了克服工作记忆的这一局限，通常采用以下两种方法：

分解：将复杂问题拆分为多个小部分，逐一进行单独分析。
可视化：通过图表等形式，将问题的各个部分有序地展示出来，帮助理解各部分之间的相互关系。

所有的结构化分析技术都运用了这些方法，因为它们有助于将分析思路具象化，这是结构化分析的核心。对于一些较为简单的分析技术，通过分解问题来有序地呈现数据，是它们提升分析效果的关键所在。

在项目启动之初，运用简明的检查清单能够显著提升组织工作的效率。在《战略情报中的批判性思维》一书中，Pherson 和 Pherson 探讨了如何通过检查清单和批判性思维的助记工具，例如了解客户检查清单、启动检查清单、AIMS（受众、议题、信息和叙事线）以及议题重定义，来辅助这一过程。这些工具和技术相互结合，能够帮助分析师构思并启动新的项目。如果分析师能够从一开始就走上正确的轨道，避免后续的调整，那么将能够节省宝贵的时间。

在本章中，我们将介绍五种基本的组织数据和启动分析的方法。

分析是将信息分解成其基本组成部分的过程。任何包含多个部分的事物都具有一个结构，这个结构将这些部分相互联系起来。进行分析的首要步骤之一是确定分析问题的合适结构，这样我们就可以识别出各个组成部分，并开始收集与之相关的信息。由于分析问题种类繁多，因此也存在着多种不同的分析结构方法。

—— 理查兹·J·霍耶尔，《情报分析心理学》（1999）

技术概览排序是一种基础的数据组织技术，它常常能够揭示新的见解。在初步的数据收集和假设构建阶段，排序尤其有效。

排名、评分和优先级排序技术则是用来根据项目的重要性、吸引力、优先程度、价值或发生的可能性来组织列表中的项目。

直译矩阵是一种通用的分析工具，用于以促进比较和分析的方式对数据进行排序和组织。它们用于分析两个变量集之间的关系或单个变量集的相互关系。矩阵由一个网格组成，该网格具有研究问题所需的尽可能多的单元格。矩阵被如此频繁地用于分析问题，以至于我们在本书中包含了几个不同的技术。

过程映射用于识别和绘制复杂过程中的每个步骤。存在许多不同的版本，包括事件流程图、活动流程图和价值流图。分析师可以使用这些技术来跟踪商业竞争对手、外国政府、犯罪或恐怖组织或其他任何非国家行为者所采取的计划或项目的进展。

甘特图是一种特定类型的过程映射，它使用矩阵来绘制多方面过程在特定时间段内的进展。过程映射和甘特图主要为商业和军事用途而开发，但它们对情报分析师也很有用。

其他用于组织和展示数据的类似技术包括各种类型的图表、图表和树状图。我们没有在本书中讨论它们，因为它们在其他作品中得到了很好的覆盖，并且有必要在这里划定所包含技术的数量。

5.1 排序排序是一种基本的组织大量数据的技术，通常能够产生新的见解。

何时使用当信息元素可以被分解成类别或子类别以相互比较时，排序是有效的，通常使用计算机程序，如电子表格。这项技术在分析的初始数据收集和假设生成阶段特别有用。

附加价值

排序与分析大量数据的重要性将大量数据按照相关类别进行排序和比较，能够帮助分析师发现潜在的趋势、相似性、差异或异常情况，这些信息如果不经过系统的分析可能会被忽视。特别是在处理交易数据时，这些数据往往涉及地理空间信息或货物、资金的转移，对数据进行排序不仅是辅助性的，很多时候是分析工作的基础。

分析方法遵循以下步骤进行数据分析：

1. ** 确定数据集 **：明确包含您所需分析的交易数据的数据集。
2. ** 数据清洗 **：确保数据集中的数据是干净和准确的，剔除任何不完整或不一致的记录。
3. ** 数据分类 **：根据特定的属性或标准，如地理位置、交易类型或交易金额，对数据进行分类。
4. ** 数据比较 **：在分类的基础上，对不同类别之间的数据进行比较，以识别潜在的模式或异常。
5. ** 分析结果 **：运用统计分析工具或数据可视化技术来深入分析比较结果，揭示数据背后的趋势、相似性、差异或异常。
6. ** 报告发现 **：将分析结果整理成易于理解的报告，为决策提供依据。

为了找出哪些信息类别或类别组合能够揭示研究问题的趋势或异常，我们需要对信息类别进行仔细审查。采用结构化头脑风暴方法，比如集群头脑风暴或从外向内思考，确保我们能够全面地列出所有可能的类别。将收集到的数据整理进电子表格或数据库，根据需要设置多个字段（列），以便区分不同的数据类型，如日期、时间、地点、人员、活动、数量等。详细列出与问题相关的事实、信息或假设，并使用纸张、白板或便签等工具进行记录。

在数据库或电子表格中仔细检查这些信息，找出能够揭示潜在模式或分组的关键字段。这些模式或分组将帮助我们确定哪些类别最值得关注。例如，分析恐怖活动时发现，多数袭击发生在酒店和餐馆，但袭击的具体时间各不相同，因此「地点」和「时间」成为关键的分析类别。

选择一个类别，对数据进行排序，并寻找可能的洞察、趋势或异常现象。优秀的分析师能够识别出趋势，而卓越的分析师则能够发现异常。请他人对排序后的信息进行审查，看看是否存在其他的排序方式。列出所有可能的排序模式，这对于分析问题非常有帮助。通过多种排序模式分析数据，可以发现数据与类别之间的相关性。但要注意，相关性并不直接等同于因果关系。

示例 1：
外国对手的军事领导人对美国在中东的政策持何种态度？为了解答这一问题，分析人员根据可能揭示问题本质的各种因素对领导人进行分类，如出生地、母语、宗教信仰、专业教育程度、国外军事或学术交流经历（地点 / 时间）、所属军事单位的领域 / 指挥任务、生活中的政治影响以及政治决策。随后，分析人员对这些信息进行审查，以探寻各分类间是否存在共通之处。

示例 2：
分析人员审查五个共谋者之间的手机通信数据，旨在揭示通话频率、通话模式、计划活动前通话频率的变化、通话的具体日期和时间以及通话内容。

示例 3：
分析人员正在全面审查与对手的大规模杀伤性武器（WMD）计划相关的所有信息。电子情报数据显示，仅在过去一年内就监测到超过 300,000 次发射器信号。分析人员对这些数据进行分类整理，依据发射器类型、发射日期和地理位置，发现发射器活动呈现出波动性，并能识别出一些细微的趋势。分析人员进一步筛选数据，仅保留与防空系统相关的信息，并对这些信息按防空系统类型、地理位置和活动日期进行分类。

意译值得注意的是，防空监视和早期预警系统经历了一段异常活跃的时期。分析人员调查了相关的外部事件，发现该国境外的一个主要反对派组织举行了一次新闻发布会，揭露了对手的大规模杀伤性武器（WMD）活动，并指出了国内的具体活动地点。新闻发布会后不到四小时，所有被怀疑与 WMD 活动有关的地点，包括一些未在发布会上提及的地点，其防空监视级别均提升至战时状态。分析人员对所有显示活动增加的防空地点进行了审查，这些活动被认为与新闻发布会和 WMD 计划有关，并发现了两个之前未被认定为与 WMD 相关的地点也出现了活动增加。这些新发现的地点被纳入收集计划，以便进一步调查它们与 WMD 计划的可能联系。

潜在陷阱不恰当的排序可能会掩盖重要的信息，就像它可能会揭示信息一样。因此，对数据进行标准化处理至关重要。与经验丰富的分析人员合作，可以帮助你规避这一陷阱。

这种技术的起源排序作为一种数据组织方法，历史悠久。本章所描述的排序方法源自军事情报培训材料。

5.2 排名、评分和优先排序

使用指南本节介绍了三种排名方法 —— 排名投票、配对比较和加权排名，为分析师提供了实用的操作指南。结合探索技术，如集群头脑风暴，与排名技术相结合，是启动新项目的有效策略。头脑风暴技术能够帮助我们产生一系列的驱动因素、关键变量、指标、潜在情景、关键人物、历史案例、信息来源以及待解决的问题等。这些列表经过排名、评分和优先排序后，能够清晰地展示出哪些项目最为关键、最有价值、最有可能发生，以及哪些应优先处理。

何时应用排名技术通常是在进行结构化头脑风暴之后的重要步骤，例如在集群头脑风暴、思维导图或名义小组技术（详见第 6 章）之后。当面对大量项目需要排名，且排名结果具有重大影响，需要尽可能精确时，或者需要综合多位分析师的意见时，排名技术显得尤为重要。

价值提升组织技术常用于整理关键事件、核心因素、需考虑的变量或关键人物的列表。通过排名、评分和优先排序这些列表，分析师能够识别出哪些项目最为关键、最有价值、最有可能发生，并迅速采取行动。将头脑风暴技术与排名技术相结合，是分析师为办公室内外协作奠定基础的有效途径。

方法

5.2.1 排名投票方法在排名投票的过程中，小组成员根据个人的偏好或认为的物品重要性，独立地对每个物品进行排序。根据物品的数量或特定的分析需求，小组可以决定对所有物品进行排序，或者只对前三到五个进行排序。小组领导或协调者会分发列有所有待投票物品的简单选票。每个成员根据自己的偏好顺序投票。如果成员认为两个物品同等重要，可以给它们分配相同的排名。例如，如果两个物品并列第二，每个物品将获得 2.5 的排名（通过取 2 和 3 的平均值）。未投票的物品将排在排名列表的底部。小组成员投票后，将票数相加。票数最少的物品排名第一。

5.2.2 配对比较方法在这里讨论的三种方法中，排名投票是最简单和最快速的，通常已经足够好。然而，当你超过排名前两三个物品后，它的准确性就不那么高了，因为小组通常对较低排名的物品思考得不多（可能也不那么关心）。排名投票提供的信息也比配对比较或加权排名少。排名投票只显示一个物品的排名高于或低于另一个物品；它不显示高多少或低多少。配对比较确实提供了这些信息；加权排名提供了更多的信息。它指定了用于排名的标准，并为列表中每个物品的这些标准分配了权重。

配对比较法是一种将每个项目与其他所有项目进行比较的方法，分析人员可以为每次比较分配一个分数，以表明一个项目相对于其他项目的重要性、偏好或概率有多大。这种方法不仅提供了一个简单的排名，还显示了每个项目的重要性或偏好的程度。然后，可以使用间隔型量表将项目列表沿重要性或偏好等维度进行排序。

使用该技术的步骤如下：

1. 列出要比较的项目，并为每个项目指定一个代号。
2. 创建一个表格，顶部和左侧都有代号，如图 5.2a 所示。每对项目的比较结果记录在此表格的单元格中。注意较暗颜色的对角线单元格，这些单元格不使用，因为每个项目永远不会与自身进行比较。对角线下方的单元格不使用，因为它们会复制对角线上方单元格中的比较。
3. 如果你在一个小组中工作，请为每个参与者发放此表格的空白副本。
4. 查看对角线上方的单元格，比较行中的项目与列中的项目。
5. 对于每个单元格，判断两个项目中哪一个更重要（或更可取或更可能）。
6. 在单元格中记录这次比较的获胜者的代号，并根据 0（没有差异）到 3（主要差异）的量表为差异的程度打分，如图 5.2a 所示。

图 5.2A 的描述：配对比较矩阵。通过将每个字母的所有值相加来汇总结果，并将这个数字放入「分数」列。例如，在图 5.2a 中，项目 B 在第一行有一个 3，在第二行有一个 2 和两个 1，总分为 7。最后，可能希望将这些值转换为总分的百分比。为此，将总分数（在本例中为 20）除以每个单独项目的分数。项目 B 以 7 分排名最重要或最受欢迎。项目 B 获得了 35% 的分数（7 除以 20），相比之下，项目 D 为 25%，而项目 C 和 E 各只有 5%，它们各自只获得了一票。这个例子展示了配对比较如何捕捉每个排名之间的差异程度。要汇总一组分析师收到的排名，只需将每个分析师的个别分数相加。

5.2.3 方法：加权排名在加权排名中，使用一组指定的标准来对项目进行排名。分析师创建一个表格，将待排名的项目列在表格的顶部，将排名的标准列在左侧（参见图 5.2b）。进行排名有多种有效的方法。我们在这里选择展示加权排名的简单版本，因为分析师通常是在做出主观判断而不是处理硬性数字。在阅读以下步骤时，请参考图 5.2b：

未找到意译内容

图 5.2B 加权排名矩阵现在为所有项目添加列。结果将是一个从最高分到最低分的项目排名。为了更清晰地比较项目间的排名，将这些原始分数转换为百分比。为此，首先将「总计」行中的所有分数相加以得到一个总分数。然后，将每个项目的分数除以这个总分数，得到每个项目的百分比排名。所有百分比加在一起必须等于 100%。在图 5.2b 中，很明显项目 B 排名第一（占 20.3%），而项目 E 排名最低（占 13.2%）。

潜在陷阱当使用这些技术中的任何一种来汇总一组分析师的意见时，每个小组成员提供的排名被总计并平均。这意味着那些观点与其他人截然不同的离群者的意见被混合到平均值中。因此，排名并没有显示出可能存在于一组中的不同意见的范围。在某些情况下，识别持有少数派意见的离群者可能具有重要价值。进一步的研究可能会证实离群者的观点是正确的。

与其他技术的关联某种形式的排名、评分或优先排序通常与集群头脑风暴、思维导图、名义小组技术以及决策矩阵一起使用，所有这些都产生了应该被评估或优先排序的想法。德尔菲方法的应用也可能从外部专家那里产生需要评估或优先排序的想法。

这项技术的起源

排名、评分和优先级排序是多个领域中常用的分析方法，它们帮助我们根据不同标准对事物进行排序和决策。这些方法的原理和应用广泛，本文主要基于网络资源进行介绍。例如，排名投票是一种通过投票来确定事物顺序的方法，我们参考了维基百科上的投票系统页面（http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system）来了解其详细机制。配对比较则是一种通过两两比较来确定优劣的方法，我们参考了 Mind Tools 网站（http://www.mindtools.com）上的相关内容。加权排名则是一种根据不同权重对事物进行排序的方法，我们参考了剑桥大学工程系网站上的决策工具页面（www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/dstools/choosing/criter.html）来了解其应用。

5.3 矩阵矩阵是一种强大的分析工具，它通过构建一个由行和列组成的网格，帮助我们对数据进行有序的排列和组织，从而便于进行比较和深入分析。矩阵的每个单元格可以填入特定的数据或信息，使得复杂的数据结构化，便于理解和处理。

在本书中，一些经常使用矩阵进行分析的主题或问题被特别提出来，作为独立的分析技术进行详细讨论。这些技术利用矩阵的特性，帮助我们更有效地解决特定类型的分析问题。

本章介绍的甘特图通过矩阵分析任务间的关联性及其时间安排。配对比较法则利用矩阵记录两两项目间的相互关系。加权排名通过矩阵评估特定项目与其评价标准之间的联系。竞争性假设分析和矛盾发现器™（第 7 章）运用矩阵探讨信息与假设之间的对应关系。交叉影响矩阵（第 7 章）通过矩阵揭示影响结果的变量或驱动力之间的互动。交叉影响矩阵是复杂性管理者（第 10 章）的组成部分。指标评估（第 9 章）通过矩阵衡量指标在不同情境下的独特性或诊断价值。机会孵化器™（第 10 章）通过矩阵指导决策者选择最有效的行动方案，以预防不利情况或促进有利情况的发生。决策矩阵（第 10 章）通过矩阵探讨目标或偏好与决策选项之间的联系。影响矩阵（第 10 章）通过矩阵展示新政策或决策对关键利益相关者的潜在影响，并探讨最佳的管理策略。

何时应用矩阵矩阵用于探究两组变量间的关系或一组变量内部的相互作用。矩阵帮助分析人员实现以下目标：

- 比较不同类型的信息
- 比较同类型信息的不同部分
- 按类型对信息进行分类
- 识别信息中的模式
- 分解问题的组成部分

矩阵作为一种简单且灵活的工具，是分析师在处理大量数据时的首选。然而，矩阵的一个局限性在于，信息必须仅沿着两个维度进行组织。

增值矩阵为复杂的数据集提供了一种视觉化的展示方式，使得分析师能够更直观地理解和处理大量数据。通过将分析问题分解成各个部分，每个部分（即矩阵中的每个单元格）可以单独进行分析，同时保持问题的整体上下文，从而提高了分析的效率和深度。

此外，矩阵还能帮助建立一个分析框架，为理解问题提供更严谨的结构，或者生成一个更全面的替代方案集合，从而增强了解释现象的能力。

方法矩阵的使用方法多样，但它们都有一个共同点：每个矩阵都有一个网格，用于输入两组数据进行比较的列和行。在开始输入数据之前，应先以某种逻辑顺序组织每组数据的类别标题，将一组数据的标题放在顶行，另一组的标题放在最左边的列中。然后，在适当的单元格中输入数据，以便进行有效的比较和分析。

图 5.3，「重新思考国家安全概念：一种新生态」，展示了一个复杂的矩阵，它不仅有效地组织了数据，还通过数据呈现了一个分析性的叙事。这个矩阵揭示了国家安全概念在近几十年的演变，并预示着我们对国家安全的理解将继续扩展。在这个矩阵中，国家安全的各种威胁沿着垂直轴排列，最顶端是传统的威胁源 —— 国家本身。而在轴的下端，则是更为抽象的系统性威胁，比如传染病或无形的全球性威胁。矩阵的顶行列出了应对威胁的三种主要手段：军事力量、警务与监控、以及国际合作。矩阵中的每个单元格都通过历史案例，展示了这三种手段如何针对五种不同的威胁来源进行应对。例如，左上角的深色单元格展示了使用军事力量解决国家间冲突的经典案例。而在右下角，则展示了在面对如大流行病这样的系统性威胁时，各方如何通过合作来共同应对。

描述图 5.3 重新思考国家安全概念：一种新生态来源：Pherson Associates, LLC, 2019。

经典的国家安全定义主要关注国家间可能发生的冲突。矩阵的左上角列出了三种军事行动。然而，近几十年来，国家安全的威胁范围已经扩大，包括了次国家行为者、恐怖组织和其他犯罪团体所构成的威胁。与此同时，维和行动和国际警察的使用也比以往更加频繁。这种对「国家安全」概念的扩展体现在矩阵左上角的其他五个单元格（中等颜色）中。而矩阵右侧和底部的剩余单元格（浅色）则展示了随着全球化进程的加深，国家安全概念的进一步扩展。

通过这种矩阵展示方式，我们可以观察到关键参与者在情报收集和信息共享方面的行为模式，这些模式沿着两个主要维度发生变化。在图 5.3 的左上角，国家的行为是针对对手收集情报，对其进行分类，并加以保护。然而，当沿着矩阵对角线移动到右下角时，这种做法发生了转变。在图的右下角，信息通常来源于未分类的公开来源，而首要任务是尽快将这些信息传播给所有人。这种变化在中间点可能会导致严重的紧张关系，例如，国土安全领域的从业者需要找到有效的方法，与州和地方执法官员共享敏感的国家安全信息。

这项技术的起源这种基本且广泛使用的技术的描述来源于 Pherson Associates, LLC 的培训材料。国家安全矩阵是由 Randolph H. Pherson 开发的。

5.4 过程地图

流程图绘制是一种广泛的方法，用于识别和展示复杂过程中的各个步骤。它包括多种流程图，如活动流程图、商品流程图和因果流程图，以及关系图和价值流图，这些工具常用于商业和工业过程中，以评估和规划改进措施。流程图，也称为流程图，是分析人员用来追踪事件或商品在复杂系统中的逐步流动的图表，帮助识别关键流程和相互关系。这些图表通常由不同类型的方框组成，通过箭头连接，以展示流程的流向。

在何时使用流程图流程图可以用来追踪资金和其他商品的流动，监控商品从生产到交付的整个过程，排列事件的顺序，或是展示决策过程。它们是分析人员用来记录、研究、规划和向他人传达复杂过程的强大工具。在执法和情报分析中，流程图被广泛用于描绘犯罪和恐怖活动的网络。

流程图的价值通过流程图，分析人员可以识别出过程中的关键路径和潜在瓶颈，以及发现之前未被注意到的关系。在执法领域，流程图帮助分析人员深入理解各种活动的含义，探索完成任务的不同方法，更好地把握事件之间的联系，并将注意力集中在研究和调查中最为关键的环节上。

绘制流程图的方法绘制流程图的过程并不复杂。首先，列出与研究事件相关的所有具体活动、步骤或事件。然后，确定这些活动之间的先后顺序，哪些必须先发生，哪些必须后发生，哪些可以同时进行。最后，使用圆圈或方框来表示这些活动，用箭头来表示它们的顺序，绘制出一张清晰的流程图。

未找到意译内容

直译情报分析师利用甘特图来追踪、理解和监督外国政府、犯罪或恐怖组织或其他非国家行为者所进行的与情报相关的活动进展。例如，甘特图可用于以下方面：

- 监控新型武器系统的研发进度、重大军事行动的筹备情况，或是任何涉及一系列可观察步骤的重大计划的执行情况。
- 识别并描述犯罪或恐怖组织的作案手法，包括这些组织在实施重大行动前通常会进行的准备工作。
- 描述并监控激进化过程，即一个普通青年如何随着时间的推移转变为恐怖分子的过程。
- 追踪信息或报告如何在情报机构的收集和处理系统中流动，直至到达分析师的桌面 —— 以及在这一过程中，信息可能如何因错误的翻译或过度概括而被曲解，导致实际事件或最初声明的准确性受损。

增值构建甘特图的过程有助于分析师清晰地思考他人完成复杂项目所需的具体步骤。一旦对手的计划或过程被充分理解，以至于可以被图表化，分析师便能回答以下问题：他们在进行什么活动？他们的进展如何？他们还需要完成哪些任务？他们将需要哪些资源来完成这些任务？在他们获得这种能力之前，我们还有多少时间？在这个过程中是否存在任何可以用来阻止或减缓活动的脆弱点？

甘特图作为一种可视化工具，用于向客户传达这些信息。如果信息充足，分析师对过程的深入理解将产生一系列指标，这些指标可用于监控正在进行中的计划或项目的状态。

方法

甘特图是一种用于规划和跟踪项目进度的工具，它通过一个矩阵来展示项目中的各项任务及其时间安排。在这个矩阵中，最左侧的列列出了项目的所有任务或过程中的步骤，而顶部的行则展示了完成这些任务所需的预计时间，通常以周、月或年为单位。每个任务都用一条水平线或条形图来表示，这条线或图的起止点代表了该任务的开始和结束时间。专业人士通常使用 Microsoft Project 等软件来绘制甘特图，但也可以使用 Excel 或手工在图纸上制作。

关于如何创建甘特图的详细指南，可以从相关的专业资源中找到。

举个例子，美国情报界的分析师在监控恐怖组织方面有着丰富的经验。假设一名分析师需要创建一个关于恐怖袭击规划过程的甘特图。他首先会列出恐怖分子必须完成的所有任务，并为每个任务估计一个时间表，同时确定完成任务所需的资源。在这个过程中，有些任务必须按照特定的顺序执行，即前一个任务必须完成到一定程度后，下一个任务才能开始，这些任务被称为顺序任务或线性任务。而另一些任务则可以在任何时间点开始，不依赖于其他任务的完成，这些被称为并行任务或非依赖任务。

在创建甘特图时，分析师需要明确每个任务是顺序的还是并行的。这种任务之间的依赖关系对于预测项目或过程的总时长至关重要。并行任务越多，项目按时完成的可能性就越大；而顺序任务越多，整个项目因单一瓶颈而延误的风险就越高。

在输入任务到甘特图时，首先按照顺序输入任务，并确保这些任务只有在它们依赖的任务完成后才会开始。接着，将并行任务安排在矩阵下方的合适时间段内，以避免它们干扰到项目关键路径上的顺序任务。

通用过程的甘特图不仅可以映射过程，还可以随着数据的接收，跟踪更具体的过程信息。例如，图 5.5 所示的甘特图可以作为模板，在其上用不同的颜色或线型叠加特定团队活动的详细信息。通过叠加具体数据，分析师可以比较预期与实际数据。这样的图表能够识别并分析数据中的差距或异常，甚至能够揭示并质疑关于预期或实际情况的假设。考虑这些可能性的分析意义重大，它可能决定了我们是能够预测攻击，还是错误地认为缺乏活动就意味着缺乏意图。矩阵揭示了这些差距，并促使分析师探索各种可能的解释。

这项技术的起源可以追溯到 19 世纪 90 年代中期，当时波兰工程师卡罗尔·阿达米茨基设计了第一个甘特图，他在波兰南部经营一家钢铁厂。大约 15 年后，美国工程师和项目管理顾问亨利·甘特创造了他的图表版本。亨利·甘特的图表很快在西方国家流行起来，他的名字也因此与这种类型的图表联系在一起。甘特图在 20 世纪初是一项革命性的进步，在工业发展时期，它们被用于规划工业过程，至今仍然被广泛使用。关于如何创建和使用甘特图的信息可以在 www.ganttchart.com 和 https://www.projectmanager.com/gantt-chart 上找到。
