## 0101. Introduction and Overview

A nalysis as practiced in the intelligence, law enforcement, and business communities is steadily evolving from a mental activity done predominantly by a sole analyst to a collaborative team or group activity. 1 The driving forces behind this transition include the following:

The growing complexity of international issues and the consequent requirement for multidisciplinary input to most analytic products. 2 The need to share more information quickly across organizational boundaries. The dispersion of expertise, especially as the boundaries between analysts, collectors, operators, and decision makers become blurred. The need to identify and evaluate the validity of alternative mental models. The need to counter the use of social media to distribute Digital Disinformation or fake news.

This transition is being enabled by advances in technology, such as new collaborative networks, artificial intelligence, and blockchain as well as the mushrooming growth of social networking practices among the upcoming generation of analysts. The use of Structured Analytic Techniques facilitates the transition by guiding the exchange of information and reasoning among analysts in ways that identify and eliminate a wide range of cognitive biases and other shortfalls of intuitive judgment.

0101 引言与概览

在情报、执法和商业领域，分析工作正经历一场变革，从以往由单个分析师独立思考的模式，逐渐演变为团队协作的形式。这一变革的背后，有以下几个关键因素在推动：

- 国际问题的复杂性不断增加，要求分析工作必须整合多学科的知识和视角。

- 信息共享的需求日益迫切，尤其是在不同组织之间。

- 专业知识的分布更加广泛，分析师、信息收集者、执行者和决策者之间的界限变得模糊。

- 需要对不同的心理模型进行识别和评估，以确保分析的全面性。

- 面对社交媒体上泛滥的数字虚假信息或假新闻，需要采取有效的分析手段进行应对。

技术的进步使得这一转变成为可能，包括新型的协作网络、人工智能、区块链等技术的应用，以及新一代分析师在社交网络实践中的活跃。结构化分析技术在这一过程中发挥着关键作用，它帮助分析师们在交流和推理时，识别并克服各种认知偏差，提高分析的质量。

### 1.1 Our Vision

This book defines the role and scope of Structured Analytic Techniques as a distinct analytic approach that provides a step-by-step process for dealing with the kinds of incomplete, ambiguous, and sometimes deceptive information with which analysts must work. Structured analysis is a mechanism by which internal thought processes are externalized in a systematic and transparent manner so that they can be shared, built on, and easily critiqued by others. Each technique leaves a trail that other analysts and managers can follow to see the basis for an analytic judgment. These techniques are used by individual analysts but are perhaps best utilized in a collaborative team effort in which each step of the analytic process exposes participants to divergent or conflicting perspectives. This transparency helps ensure that differences of opinion among analysts are heard and seriously considered early in the analytic process. Analysts tell us that this is one of the most valuable benefits of any structured technique.

Structured analysis helps analysts ensure that their analytic framework—the foundation upon which they form their analytic judgments—is as solid as possible. By helping break down a specific analytic problem into its component parts and specifying a step-by-step process for handling these parts, Structured Analytic Techniques help organize the amorphous mass of data with which most analysts must contend. Such techniques make our thinking more open and available for review and critique by ourselves as well as by others. This transparency enables the effective communication at the working level that is essential for intraoffice and interagency collaboration.

We call the various approaches described in this book "techniques" because they usually guide the analyst in thinking about a problem rather than provide the analyst with a definitive answer, as one might expect from a predictive tool. Structured techniques help analysts think more rigorously about a problem; they do not solve it. Structured Analytic Techniques, however, do form a methodology—a set of principles and procedures for qualitative analysis of the kinds of uncertainties that many analysts must deal with daily.

1.1 我们的愿景

本书阐述了结构化分析技术的作用和应用领域，将其作为一种特殊的分析手段，提供了一套处理分析师日常工作中遇到的不完整、模糊甚至带有误导性的信息的系统化方法。结构化分析是一种将内在思考过程以有条理且透明的方式展现出来的机制，使得这些思考可以被共享、进一步发展，并且容易受到他人的评价和批评。每种分析技术都会留下可供追踪的痕迹，让其他分析师和管理者能够理解分析判断的依据。这些技术虽然可以由个人分析师独立使用，但在团队协作中发挥最佳效果，因为在团队中，分析过程的每一步都能让成员接触到不同的或对立的观点。这种透明度确保了分析师之间的不同意见能够被及时听取并在分析过程的早期得到认真考虑。分析师们认为，这是结构化分析技术带来的最重要的好处之一。

结构化分析帮助分析师构建一个坚固的分析框架 —— 这是他们做出分析判断的基础。通过将特定的分析问题分解成各个部分，并制定出处理这些部分的详细步骤，结构化分析技术帮助分析师整理和处理他们面对的大量数据。这些技术让我们的思考更加公开，便于自我反思和他人的审查与批评。这种透明度促进了工作层面的有效沟通，这对于办公室内部和不同机构之间的合作至关重要。

我们称本书中描述的各种方法为「技术」，因为它们通常引导分析师深入思考问题，而不是直接提供一个确定的答案。这些结构化技术帮助分析师以更加严谨的方式思考问题，但它们并不直接解决问题。结构化分析技术实际上是一种方法论，它提供了一套原则和程序，用于定性分析许多分析师在日常工作中必须面对的不确定性。

### 1.2 Role of Structured Analytic Techniques

Structured Analytic Techniques are debiasing techniques. They do not replace intuitive judgment. Their role is to question intuitive judgments by identifying a wider range of options for analysts to consider. For example, a Key Assumptions Check requires the identification and consideration of additional assumptions. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses requires identification of alternative hypotheses, a focus on refuting rather than confirming hypotheses, and a more systematic analysis of the evidence. All structured techniques described in this book have a "Value Added" section that describes how this technique contributes to better analysis. Structured Analytic Techniques help mitigate cognitive biases, misapplied heuristics, and intuitive traps that analysts often fall victim to when relying only on expert-aided judgment. For many techniques, the benefit is self-evident. None purports to always give the correct answer; instead, they identify alternatives that merit serious consideration.

No formula exists, of course, for always getting it right, but the use of structured techniques can reduce the frequency and severity of error. These techniques can help analysts deal with proven cognitive limitations, sidestep some of the known analytic biases, and explicitly confront the problems associated with unquestioned mental models or mindsets. They help analysts think more rigorously about an analytic problem and ensure that preconceptions and assumptions are explicitly examined and, when possible, tested. 3

The most common criticism of Structured Analytic Techniques is "I don't have enough time to use them." The experience of many analysts shows that this criticism is not justified. All the techniques will save an analyst time, on balance, when considering the entire arc of the analytic production schedule. Anything new does take time to learn; however, once learned, the incorporation of Structured Analytic Techniques into the analytic process saves analysts time over time. They enable individual analysts to work more efficiently, especially at the start of a project, when the analyst may otherwise flounder trying to figure out how to proceed. Structured techniques also aid group processes by improving communication as well as enhancing the collection and interpretation of evidence. And, in the end, use of a structured technique results in a product in which the reasoning behind the conclusions is more transparent and more readily accepted than one derived from other methods. Transparent reasoning expedites review by supervisors and editors while also compressing the coordination process. 4

Analytic methods are important, but method alone is far from sufficient to ensure analytic accuracy or value. Method must be combined with substantive expertise and an inquiring and imaginative mind. And these, in turn, must be supported and motivated by the organizational environment in which the analysis is done.

1.2 结构化分析技术的作用

结构化分析技术是一种旨在减少偏见的技术。它们并不取代分析师的直觉判断，而是通过提供更广泛的选择来挑战这些直觉判断。例如，关键假设检查要求分析师识别并考虑额外的假设。竞争假设分析则要求识别不同的假设，专注于反驳而非简单确认假设，以及对证据进行更为系统的分析。本书中介绍的每种结构化技术都有一个「增值」部分，这部分详细说明了该技术如何帮助提升分析的质量。结构化分析技术有助于减少认知偏差、避免启发式方法的误用，以及规避那些分析师在仅依赖直觉判断时容易陷入的陷阱。对于许多技术而言，其益处是显而易见的。这些技术并不保证总是给出正确答案，而是帮助识别那些值得深入考虑的替代方案。

当然，没有一种万能的公式能够保证分析总是正确无误，但采用结构化技术可以显著降低错误的发生率和影响。这些技术能够帮助分析师应对已知的认知局限，避免一些常见的分析偏差，并且明确地挑战那些未经检验的心理模型或思维定势。它们促使分析师对分析问题进行更为严谨的思考，确保所有的预设和假设都得到明确的审视，并在可能的情况下进行验证。3

最常听到的对结构化分析技术的批评是「我没有足够的时间去应用它们」。然而，众多分析师的实践经验表明，这种批评并不成立。实际上，从长远来看，所有这些技术在分析生产的整个周期中，总体上都会为分析师节省时间。学习任何新技术都需要投入时间，但一旦掌握了结构化分析技术，将其融入日常分析工作中，分析师将随着时间的推移而节省出更多的时间。这些技术尤其在项目初期，当分析师可能还在摸索如何开展工作时，能够提高工作效率。结构化技术还能通过提升沟通效率和加强证据的收集与解读，来优化团队合作过程。最终，采用结构化技术所产出的分析成果，其推理过程更为清晰，因此比使用其他方法得出的结论更易于被接受。清晰的推理不仅加速了上级和编辑的审核流程，也简化了协调过程。4

分析方法固然重要，但仅凭方法本身远远不足以保证分析的准确性和价值。方法必须与深厚的专业知识、探究精神和创造性思维相结合。而这些要素又需要在一个支持性和激励性的组织环境中得到滋养和发展。

### 1.3 History of Structured Analytic Techniques

The term "structured analytic techniques" was first used in the U.S. Intelligence Community in 2005. The concept originated in the 1980s, when the eminent teacher of intelligence analysis, Jack Davis, first began teaching and writing about what he called "alternative analysis." 5 The term referred to the evaluation of alternative explanations or hypotheses, better understanding of other cultures, and analysis of events from the other country's point of view rather than by Mirror Imaging. In the mid-1980s, some initial efforts were made to initiate the use of more alternative analytic techniques in the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Intelligence. Under the direction of Robert Gates, then CIA Deputy Director for Intelligence, analysts employed several new techniques to generate scenarios of dramatic political change, track political instability, and anticipate military coups. Douglas MacEachin, Deputy Director for Intelligence from 1993 to 1996, supported new standards for systematic and transparent analysis that helped pave the path to further change. 6

The term "alternative analysis" became widely used in the late 1990s after (1) Adm. David Jeremiah's postmortem analysis of the U.S. Intelligence Community's failure to foresee India's 1998 nuclear test, (2) a U.S. congressional commission's review of the Intelligence Community's global missile forecast in 1998, and (3) a report from the CIA Inspector General that focused higher-level attention on the state of the Directorate of Intelligence's analytic tradecraft. The Jeremiah report specifically encouraged increased use of what it called "red team analysis."

The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms.

— Socrates, Greek philosopher

When the Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis at the CIA was created in 2000 to improve the effectiveness of intelligence analysis, John McLaughlin, then Deputy Director for Intelligence, tasked the school to consolidate techniques for doing what was then referred to as "alternative analysis." In response to McLaughlin's tasking, the Kent School developed a compilation of techniques that the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence started teaching in a course that later evolved into the Advanced Analytic Tools and Techniques Workshop. The Kent School subsequently opened the class to analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency and other elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community.

The various investigative commissions that followed the surprise terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as the erroneous analysis of Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction, cranked up pressure for more rigorous approaches to intelligence analysis. For example, the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 assigned to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) "responsibility for ensuring that, as appropriate, elements of the intelligence community conduct alternative analysis (commonly referred to as ‘red-team' analysis) of the information and conclusions in intelligence analysis."

Over time, analysts who misunderstood, or resisted the call for more rigor, interpreted alternative analysis as simply meaning an alternative to the normal way that analysis is done. For them the term implied that alternative procedures were needed only in exceptional circumstances when an analysis is of critical importance. Kent School instructors countered that the techniques were not alternatives to traditional analysis but were central to good analysis and should become routine—instilling rigor and structure into the analysts' everyday work process.

In 2004, when the Kent School decided to update its training materials based on lessons learned during the previous several years and publish A Tradecraft Primer , 7 Randolph H. Pherson and Roger Z. George were the primary drafters. As George observed at the time, "There was a sense that the name ‘alternative analysis' was too limiting and not descriptive enough. At least a dozen different analytic techniques were all rolled into one term, so we decided to find a name that was more encompassing and suited this broad array of approaches to analysis." 8 Randy Pherson credits his wife, Kathy, with creating the name "Structured Analytic Techniques" during a dinner table conversation. George organized the techniques into three categories: diagnostic techniques, contrarian techniques, and imagination techniques. The term "Structured Analytic Techniques" became official in June 2005, when the Kent School formally approved the updated training materials.

The use of the term "alternative analysis," however, persists in official directives. The DNI is tasked under the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 with ensuring that elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community conduct alternative analysis, which it now describes as the inclusion of alternative outcomes and hypotheses in analytic products. We view "alternative analysis" as covering only a subset of what now is regarded as Structured Analytic Techniques and recommend avoiding use of the term "alternative analysis" to forestall any confusion. We strongly endorse, however, the "analysis of alternatives"—be they hypotheses or scenarios—as an essential component of good analysis.

1.3 结构化分析技术的历史

「结构化分析技术」这一术语在 2005 年首次被美国情报界采用。这一概念的根源可以追溯到 20 世纪 80 年代，当时杰出的情报分析教育家杰克·戴维斯开始传授并撰写关于他所倡导的「替代分析」方法。这种方法强调对多种解释或假设的评估，深入理解不同文化，并从其他国家的视角而非简单地以自我为中心来分析事件。在 20 世纪 80 年代中期，中央情报局情报局在罗伯特·盖茨的领导下，当时的副局长，开始尝试引入更多创新的分析技术，以构建政治剧变的情景，监测政治不稳定，并预测潜在的军事政变。道格拉斯·麦克英泰因在 1993 年至 1996 年担任副局长期间，推动了更为系统和透明的分析标准，为分析方法的进一步革新奠定了基础。

「替代分析」这一术语在 20 世纪 90 年代末期得到了广泛应用，这主要得益于以下几个事件：（1）海军上将大卫·杰拉姆对美国情报界未能预见印度 1998 年核试验的深刻反思；（2）美国国会委员会对情报界全球导弹预测的严格审查；以及（3）中央情报局监察长的一份报告，该报告引起了对情报局分析技术现状的高度关注。杰拉姆的报告特别强调了增加使用「红队分析」的重要性。

智慧的起点在于对术语的精确界定。

— 苏格拉底，古希腊哲学家

2000 年，中央情报局（CIA）成立了谢尔曼肯特情报分析学院，目的是为了提高情报分析的效率。当时的情报副总监约翰·麦克劳克林给学院下达了一个任务，要求他们将当时所谓的「替代分析」技术进行整合。为了完成这个任务，肯特学院开发了一系列的技术集合，中央情报局的情报总监开始在一门课程中教授这些技术，这门课程后来发展成了高级分析工具和技术研讨会。之后，肯特学院将这门课程向国防情报局和美国情报界的其他部门的分析师开放。

2001 年 9 月 11 日恐怖袭击事件后，各种调查委员会的成立，以及对伊拉克拥有大规模杀伤性武器的错误分析，都加大了对情报分析方法更加严格的要求。例如，2004 年的《情报改革法》赋予了国家情报总监（DNI）一个责任，即确保情报界的各个成员在适当的情况下进行替代分析（通常称为「红队」分析），以对情报分析中的信息和结论进行审查。

随着时间的推移，一些分析师误解了或反对了对于分析更加严格的要求，他们将替代分析理解为仅仅是传统分析方法的另一种选择。对他们来说，这个术语意味着只有在分析具有极端重要性的特殊情况下才需要使用替代程序。肯特学院的讲师们对此进行了反驳，他们认为这些技术并不是传统分析的替代品，而是良好分析的核心要素，应该成为常规做法 —— 将严谨性和结构融入到分析师的日常工作流程中。

在 2004 年，肯特学校为了根据过去几年积累的经验更新培训材料，决定出版《贸易技巧入门》一书，7 伦道夫·H·菲舍尔和罗杰·Z·乔治是该书的主要起草人。乔治当时指出，「‘替代分析'这一名称给人的感觉过于局限且不够描述性。至少有十几种不同的分析技术都被归入这一术语，因此我们决定寻找一个更全面、更适合这一广泛分析方法的名称。」8 兰迪·菲舍尔的妻子凯西在一次餐桌谈话中提出了‘结构化分析技术'这一名称，兰迪对此表示赞赏。乔治将这些技术组织成三个类别：诊断技术、对立技术、和想象力技术。2005 年 6 月，「结构化分析技术」这一术语正式成为官方术语，当时肯特学校正式批准了更新的培训材料。

尽管如此，‘替代分析'这一术语仍在官方指令中被使用。根据 2004 年的《情报改革法》，国家情报总监有责任确保美国情报界的各个部门进行替代分析，现在将其定义为在分析产品中纳入替代结果和假设。我们将「替代分析」视为现在被认为是结构化分析技术的一个子集，并建议避免使用「替代分析」这一术语，以防止任何混淆。然而，我们强烈支持「分析替代方案」—— 无论是假设还是情景 —— 作为良好分析的一个基本组成部分。

### 1.4 The Expanding Use of Structured Analytic Techniques

Intelligence community analysts in the United States and in foreign intelligence services have used structured techniques for over a decade, but the general use of these techniques by the typical analyst is a relatively new phenomenon. Most analysts using the techniques today were not exposed to them when they were college students. The driving forces behind the development and use of these techniques in the intelligence profession, and increasingly in the private sector, are (1) an increased appreciation of cognitive limitations that make intelligence analysis so difficult, (2) prominent intelligence failures that have prompted reexamination of how intelligence analysis is generated, (3) increased policy support and technical support for intraoffice and interagency collaboration, and (4) a desire by policymakers to make analytic conclusions more transparent.

In the early 2000s, the Directorate of Intelligence's senior management, which strongly supported using Structured Analytic Techniques, created Tradecraft Cells in its analytic units to mentor analysts in how to use structured techniques and to facilitate the integration of the techniques into ongoing projects. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were the next agencies to incorporate structured techniques formally into their training programs followed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Structured techniques are now used throughout the entire U.S. Intelligence Community.

The U.S. Intelligence Community's adoption of structured techniques spurred many academic institutions to incorporate training in the techniques into their homeland security and intelligence studies programs, which were quickly propagating across the United States. Foreign universities also incorporated instruction on structured techniques into their undergraduate and master's degree programs, including institutions in Spain, Canada, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and Australia, followed by other universities on six continents.

Publication of the first edition of this book in 2011, followed by an expanded second edition in 2015, and discussions of their utility in various annual international conferences helped propagate the use of Structured Analytic Techniques initially in the intelligence services of the Five Eyes countries (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand). Use of this book and the techniques has expanded over the years to almost all European intelligence services and other services around the world. The book is now being used by analysts in intelligence services, businesses, universities, and nongovernmental organizations in at least two dozen countries. 9

Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis has been translated into Spanish, Chinese, and Korean. The publisher has received inquiries about translations into several other languages. A companion volume, Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence , has also been translated into Chinese and Polish.

1.4 结构化分析技术的扩展使用

美国的情报共同体分析师以及外国情报机构的分析师们已经使用结构化技术（structured techniques）超过十年，但这些技术在普通分析师中的广泛应用是一个相对较新的现象。今天使用这些技术的绝大多数分析师在大学时期并未接触过这些技术。推动这些技术在情报职业中发展并广泛应用，以及在私营部门中日益增长的高数据量，主要有以下四个原因：（1）对认知局限性（cognitive limitations）的认识增强，这些局限性使得情报分析变得如此困难；（2）一些重大的情报失误（prominent intelligence failures）促使人们重新审视情报分析的生成方式；（3）对内部办公室和跨机构合作（intraoffice and interagency collaboration）的政策和技术支持增加；（4）政策制定者希望使分析结论（analytic conclusions）更加透明。

在 21 世纪初，情报总监办公室的高级管理层强烈支持使用结构化分析技术，并在其分析单位中创建了「工艺细胞」（Tradecraft Cells），这些细胞的目的是指导分析师如何使用结构化技术，并促进这些技术融入正在进行的项目中。联邦调查局（FBI）、国防情报局（DIA）和国土安全部（DHS）是接下来正式将结构化技术纳入其培训计划的机构，随后是国家安全局（NSA）、国家地理空间情报局（NGA）和海军情报办公室（ONI）。现在，结构化技术在整个美国情报界中得到了广泛应用。

美国情报界对结构化技术的采纳，激发了众多学术机构在其国土安全和情报研究课程中引入这些技术的培训，这些课程迅速在美国各地普及开来。国外的大学也不甘落后，将结构化技术的教学融入到本科和硕士学位课程中，涉及的国家包括西班牙、加拿大、英国、丹麦、德国和澳大利亚，随后六大洲的其他大学也纷纷跟进。

本书自 2011 年首版问世，到 2015 年推出内容更为丰富的第二版，以及在多个国际年度会议上对其应用价值的讨论，这些都促进了结构化分析技术在五眼国家（即美国、加拿大、英国、澳大利亚和新西兰）情报机构中的初步应用。随着时间的推移，这本书及其介绍的技术已经广泛应用于欧洲几乎所有的情报机构，以及全球其他地区的情报机构。目前，这本书已成为至少 24 个国家的情报分析师、企业、高校和非政府组织的重要参考资料。

《结构化分析技术在情报分析中的应用》一书已被翻译成西班牙语、中文和韩语，出版商还收到了关于翻译成其他语言的询问。此外，配套书籍《战略情报的批判性思维》也已被翻译成中文和波兰语。

### 1.5 Selection of Techniques for This Book

The techniques described in this book are limited to those that meet our definition of Structured Analytic Techniques, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Although the focus is on techniques for strategic intelligence analysis, many of the techniques described in this book have wide applicability to tactical military analysis, law enforcement intelligence analysis, homeland security, business consulting, the medical profession, financial planning, cyber analysis, and complex decision making in any field. The book focuses on techniques that can be used by a single analyst working alone or, preferably, with a small group or team of analysts. We excluded techniques that require sophisticated computing or complex projects of the type usually sent to an outside expert or company. Several promising techniques recommended to us were not included for this reason.

From the several hundred techniques that might have been included in this book, we selected a core group of sixty-six techniques that appear to be most useful for the intelligence profession as well as analytic pursuits in government, academia, and the private sector. 10 We omitted techniques that tend to be used exclusively for a single type of analysis in fields such as law enforcement or business consulting.

This list is not static, and we expect it to increase and decrease as new techniques are identified and others are tested and found wanting. In the second edition, we dropped two techniques and added five new ones. In this edition, Devil's Advocacy, Red Team Analysis, Role Playing, and Virtual Brainstorming were dropped for reasons explained in later chapters. A suite of techniques that relate more to analytic production—Getting Started Checklist, Client Checklist, AIMS ( A udience, I ssue, M essage, and S toryline), and Issue Redefinition—were also dropped because they are described fully in Pherson and Pherson's Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence . Nine new techniques were added: Inconsistencies Finder™, Key Uncertainties Finder™, Key Drivers Generation™, Reversing Assumptions, Analysis by Contrasting Narratives, Counterfactual Reasoning, Opportunities Incubator™, Bowtie Analysis, and Critical Path Analysis.

Some training programs may have a need to boil down the list of techniques to the essentials required for a given type of analysis. No one list will meet everyone's needs. However, we hope that having one reasonably comprehensive list and lexicon of common terminology available to the growing community of analysts now employing Structured Analytic Techniques will help to facilitate discussion and use of these techniques in projects involving collaboration across organizational boundaries.

This collection of techniques builds on work previously done in the U.S. Intelligence Community. We also have included several techniques developed and used by our British, Canadian, Spanish, Dutch, and Australian colleagues. To select the most appropriate techniques for the initial edition of this book, Richards J. Heuer Jr. reviewed a large number of books and websites dealing with intelligence analysis methodology, qualitative methods in general, decision making, problem solving, competitive intelligence, law enforcement intelligence, strategic foresight or futures research, and social science research in general. In preparation for writing the third edition, Pherson interviewed managers of intelligence programs in over a dozen agencies and foreign intelligence services to identify which techniques could be dropped and which should be added. Given the immensity of this literature, there can be no guarantee that nothing was missed.

Almost half of the techniques described in this edition have become "standard fare" in training materials used by the CIA, DIA, Office of Intelligence and Analysis in the DHS, or other intelligence agencies. Over half were newly created or adapted to the needs of intelligence analysts by Richards J. Heuer Jr. or Randolph H. Pherson to fill perceived gaps. Several of the techniques that were originally created by Randolph H. Pherson, while teaching structured techniques to intelligence analysts, students, and private-sector clients, have since been revised, reflecting lessons learned when applying the techniques to current issues.

Specific guidance is provided on how to use each technique, but this guidance is not written in stone. Many of the techniques can be implemented in more than one way, and some techniques have several different names. An experienced government analyst told one of the authors that he seldom uses a technique the same way twice. He adapts techniques to the requirements of the specific problem, and his ability to do that effectively is a measure of his experience.

In the popular literature, the names of some techniques are normally capitalized, but many are not. We have chosen to capitalize the names of all techniques for consistency's sake and to make them stand out.

1.5 本书技术选择的理由

本书所介绍的技术，仅限于符合我们之前在本章中定义的结构化分析技术范畴。尽管本书主要关注战略情报分析的技术，但书中所述的许多技术同样适用于战术军事分析、执法情报分析、国土安全、商业咨询、医疗行业、财务规划、网络分析以及任何领域的复杂决策。本书专注于那些单个分析师可以独立运用，或者更佳地，与一小群分析师协作使用的技术。我们排除了那些需要高级计算能力或通常由外部专家或公司承担的复杂项目的技术。因此，一些被推荐的有潜力的技术并未被纳入本书。

在众多可能被收录的技术中，我们精选了六十六种，这些技术对于情报行业以及政府、学术界和私营部门的分析工作尤为有用。我们没有包含那些仅用于特定领域如法律执法或商业咨询中的单一分析类型的技术。

这个列表是动态的，随着新技术的发现和旧技术的淘汰，它会不断更新。在第二版中，我们删减了两种技术，并引入了五种新技术。在这一版中，出于后文将详细说明的原因，我们移除了魔鬼代言人、红队分析、角色扮演和虚拟头脑风暴等技术。同时，一些与分析过程紧密相关的工具 —— 如启动检查表、客户检查表、AIMS（包含受众、问题、信息和叙事）和问题重定义 —— 也被移除，因为它们在 Pherson 和 Pherson 的《战略情报的批判性思维》一书中已有详尽阐述。我们新增了九种新技术，包括不一致查找器™、关键不确定性查找器™、关键驱动因素生成™、逆向假设、通过对比叙事进行分析、反事实推理、机会孵化器™、蝴蝶结分析和关键路径分析。

某些培训项目可能需要将这些技术精简至特定分析类型所需的核心技术。我们理解，没有一个列表能够满足所有人的需求。尽管如此，我们仍希望提供一个相对全面的列表和术语词汇，以便为日益增长的客户群体在使用结构化分析技术时提供支持，特别是在那些需要跨组织协作的项目中，促进这些技术的交流与应用。

这一系列技术是在美国情报界先前工作的基础上构建的，并融合了英国、加拿大、西班牙、荷兰和澳大利亚等国同事开发和使用的技术。为了挑选出本书初版中最合适的技术，理查兹·J·霍尔（Richards J. Heuer Jr.）广泛审查了涉及情报分析方法、定性研究、决策制定、问题解决、竞争情报、执法情报、战略预测以及社会科学研究等领域的书籍和网站。在准备第三版时，Pherson 对十多个机构和外国情报服务部门的情报项目经理进行了采访，以决定哪些技术应被淘汰，哪些应被引入。由于相关文献极为丰富，我们无法确保没有遗漏任何重要内容。

本版中介绍的技术中，近半数已成为中央情报局（CIA）、国防情报局（DIA）、国土安全部（DHS）情报与分析办公室等机构的培训材料中的常规内容。超过一半的技术是由理查兹·J·霍尔（Richards J. Heuer Jr.）或伦道夫·H·Pherson（Randolph H. Pherson）为填补现有空白而新创或改编的。最初由伦道夫·H·Pherson 在教授情报分析师、学生和私营部门客户结构化技术时开发的几项技术，后来根据实际应用中的经验进行了修订。

具体指导提供了如何使用每种技术的说明，但这些指导并非一成不变。许多技术可以有多种实施方式，有些技术甚至有多个不同的名称。一位资深政府分析师曾向作者透露，他很少两次使用同一种技术的方式完全相同。他根据具体问题的需求灵活运用技术，这种能力是他经验的体现。

在流行文献中，一些技术的名称通常以大写字母表示，但并非所有技术都如此。为了保持一致性和突出重点，我们选择将所有技术的名称大写。

### 1.6 Quick Overview of Chapters

Chapter 2 ("The Role of Structured Techniques") defines the domain of Structured Analytic Techniques by describing how it differs from three other major categories of intelligence analysis methodology. It presents a taxonomy with six distinct categories or families of Structured Analytic Techniques. The families are based on how each set of techniques contributes to a different phase of analytic tasks in the intelligence production process. The chapter discusses how structured techniques can help analysts avoid, overcome, or at least mitigate the cognitive biases, misapplied heuristics, and intuitive traps they fall prey to every day. It concludes with a discussion of how perpetrators of Digital Disinformation leverage these cognitive limitations to promote their agendas and how structured techniques can help counter this phenomenon.

Chapter 3 ("Choosing the Right Technique") describes the criteria we used for selecting techniques, discusses which techniques might be learned first and used the most, and provides a guide for matching techniques to analysts' needs. The guide asks twelve questions about what the analyst wants or needs to do. An affirmative answer to any question directs the analyst to the appropriate chapter(s), where the analyst can quickly zero in on the most applicable technique(s). It concludes with a description of the value of instilling five core habits of thinking into the analytic process.

Chapter 4 ("Practitioner's Guide to Collaboration") builds on our earlier observation that analysis done across the global intelligence community is in a transitional stage from a mental activity performed predominantly by a sole analyst to a collaborative team or group activity. The chapter discusses, among other things, how to expand the analytic process to include rapidly growing social networks of area and functional specialists who often work from several different geographic locations. It proposes that most analysis be done in two phases: a divergent analysis or creative phase with broad participation by a social network, followed by a convergent analysis phase and final report done by a small analytic team.

Chapters 5 through 10 each describe a different family of structured techniques, which taken together cover sixty-six structured techniques (see Figure 1.6 ). 11 Each of these chapters starts with a description of the specific family and how techniques in that family help to mitigate known cognitive biases, misapplied heuristics, or intuitive traps. A brief overview of each technique is followed by a detailed discussion of each, including when to use it, the value added, description of the method, potential pitfalls when noteworthy, relationship to other techniques, and origins of the technique.

Readers who go through these six chapters of techniques from start to finish may perceive some overlap. This repetition is for the convenience of those who use this book as a reference guide and seek out individual sections or chapters. The reader seeking only an overview of the techniques can save time by reading the introduction to each family of techniques, the brief overview of each technique, and the full descriptions of only those specific techniques that pique the reader's interest.

Highlights of the six chapters of techniques are as follows:

Chapter 5 : Getting Organized. The eight techniques cover the basics, such as checklists, sorting, ranking, and organizing your data. Chapter 6 : Exploration Techniques. The nine techniques include several types of brainstorming, including Circleboarding ™ , Starbursting, and Cluster Brainstorming, which was called Structured Brainstorming in previous editions. The Nominal Group Technique is a form of brainstorming that is appropriate when there is concern that a brainstorming session might be dominated by a particularly aggressive analyst or constrained by the presence of a senior officer. It also introduces several mapping techniques, Venn Analysis, and Network Analysis. Chapter 7 : Diagnostic Techniques . The eleven techniques covered in this chapter include the widely used Key Assumptions Check and Chronologies and Timelines. The Cross-Impact Matrix supports group learning about relationships in a complex system. Several techniques fall in the domain of hypothesis generation and testing (Multiple Hypothesis Generation, Diagnostic Reasoning, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses [ACH], Argument Mapping, and Deception Detection), including a new technique called the Inconsistencies Finder ™ , which is a simplified version of ACH. Chapter 8 : Reframing Techniques . The sixteen techniques in this family help analysts break away from established mental models by using Outside-In Thinking, Structured Analogies, Red Hat Analysis, Quadrant Crunching ™ , and the Delphi Method to reframe an issue or imagine a situation from a different perspective. What If? Analysis and High Impact/Low Probability Analysis are tactful ways to suggest that the conventional wisdom could be wrong. Two important techniques developed by the authors, Premortem Analysis and Structured Self-Critique, give analytic teams viable ways to imagine how their own analysis might be wrong. The chapter concludes with a description of a subset of six techniques grouped under the umbrella of Adversarial Collaboration and an original approach to Structured Debate. Chapter 9 : Foresight Techniques . This family of twelve techniques includes four new techniques for identifying key drivers, analyzing contrasting narratives, and engaging in Counterfactual Reasoning. The chapter also describes five methods for developing scenarios and expands the discussion of Indicators Validation and Evaluation by presenting several new techniques for generating indicators. Chapter 10 : Decision Support Techniques . The ten techniques in this family include three new Decision Support Techniques: Opportunities Incubator ™ , Bowtie Analysis, and Critical Path Analysis. The chapter also describes six classic Decision Support Techniques, including Decision Matrix, Force Field Analysis, and Pros-Cons-Faults-and-Fixes, all of which help managers, commanders, planners, and policymakers make choices or trade-offs between competing goals, values, or preferences. The chapter concludes with a description of the Complexity Manager, which was developed by Richards J. Heuer Jr.

How can we know that the use of Structured Analytic Techniques does, in fact, improve the overall quality of the analytic product? Chapter 11 ("The Future of Structured Analytic Techniques") begins with a discussion of two approaches to answer this question: logical reasoning and empirical research. The chapter then employs one of the techniques in this book, Complexity Manager, to assess the prospects for continued growth in the use of Structured Analytic Techniques. It asks the reader to imagine it is 2030 and answer the following questions based on an analysis of ten variables that could support or hinder the growth of Structured Analytic Techniques during this time period: Will structured techniques gain traction and be used with greater frequency by intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and the business sector? What forces are spurring the increased use of structured analysis? What obstacles are hindering its expansion?

1.6 章节快速概览

第 2 章（「结构化技术的作用」）通过描述它与情报分析方法学的其他三个主要类别的不同之处，定义了结构化分析技术的应用范围。本章提出了一种包含六个不同类别或家族的分类法，这些家族反映了结构化分析技术在情报生产过程中分析任务的不同阶段所起的作用。本章还探讨了结构化技术如何帮助分析师避免、克服或至少减轻他们日常工作中可能遇到的认知偏差、启发式误用和直觉陷阱。最后，本章讨论了数字虚假信息制造者如何利用人们的认知局限来推动其议程，以及结构化技术如何成为对抗这种现象的有效工具。

第 3 章（「挑选合适的技术方法」）阐述了我们选择技术方法的依据，探讨了哪些技术方法可能首先被掌握并频繁应用，并提供了一个指南，帮助分析师根据自身需求选择合适的技术方法。该指南提出了关于分析师工作目标和需求的十二个问题。对任何一个问题的肯定回答都会指引分析师前往相应的章节，以便快速定位到最合适的技术方法。本章最后强调了在分析过程中培养五种核心思维习惯的重要性。

第 4 章（「协作实践指南」）基于我们之前的观察，即全球情报界的分析工作正从主要由单个分析师独立完成转向团队或群体协作的模式。本章探讨了如何将分析过程拓展至包括来自不同地域的区域和功能专家，这些专家通常通过日益扩大的社会网络进行合作。本章提出，大多数分析工作应分为两个阶段：首先是广泛参与的社会网络进行的发散性分析或创新阶段，随后是由小型分析团队进行的收敛性分析阶段，最终形成报告。

第 5 至 10 章分别介绍了不同的结构化分析技术家族，总计涵盖了六十六种结构化技术（参见图 1.6）。每个章节首先介绍该技术家族的特点，以及这些技术如何帮助克服已知的认知偏差、启发式误用或直觉陷阱。随后是对每种技术的详细讨论，包括适用场景、带来的价值、方法描述、潜在的风险、与其他技术的关系以及技术的起源。
