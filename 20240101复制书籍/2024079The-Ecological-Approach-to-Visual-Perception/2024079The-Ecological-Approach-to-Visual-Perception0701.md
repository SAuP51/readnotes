## 0701. The Optical Information for Self-Perception

It has frequently been assumed in previous chapters that the point of observation for an ambient optic array is not occupied. The point has been thought of as a position at which observation could be made, a position that could be occupied but need not be. Such a position could just as well be occupied by another observer and, since all positions can be occupied by any observer, the invariants of the array under locomotion can be shared by all observers. It was important to establish this principle that the point of observation is public, not private, but now we must consider the other side of the coin. When a point of observation is occupied, there is also optical information to specify the observer himself, and this information cannot be shared by other observers. For the body of the animal who is observing temporarily conceals some portion of the environment in a way that is unique to that animal. I call this information propriospecific as distinguished from exterospecific, meaning that it specifies the self as distinguished from the environment.

自我感知的视觉信息

在前几章中，我们常常假设环境中的视觉信息场（ambient optic array）的观察点是空闲的。这个观察点被视为一个可以进行观察的位置，它可以被占据，但不一定非要被占据。任何观察者都可以占据这样的位置，因此，当观察者移动时，视觉信息场中保持不变的特征可以被所有观察者共享。确立「观察点是公共的，而非私人的」这一原则很重要，但现在我们需要考虑问题的另一面。

当一个观察点被占据时，也会产生一些特殊的视觉信息，这些信息能够指示观察者自身，而且不能被其他观察者共享。这是因为正在观察的动物的身体会暂时遮挡环境的某些部分，而这种遮挡方式对每个动物来说都是独特的。我将这种信息称为「本体特异性信息」（propriospecific information)，以区别于「外部特异性信息」（exterospecific information)。前者指的是与自我相关的信息，后者则是与环境相关的信息。

### 7.1 The Specifying of the Self by the Field of View

The field of view of an animal, as I will use the term, is the solid angle of the ambient light that can be registered by its ocular system. The field of view, unlike the ambient array, is bounded; it is a sort of sample of the whole sphere. The angular scope of the field of view depends on the placement of the eyes in the head, some animals having lateral eyes and a nearly panoramic field of view and others having frontal eyes and a roughly hemispherical field of view (Walls, 1942，Ch. 10). Horses belong to the first group and humans to the second. In both ocular systems, the separate fields of view of the two eyes overlap in front, but the amount of overlap is very much greater in humans than it is in animals with semipanoramic vision. By the field of view, I mean the combined fields of view of the two eyes.

An attempt is made in Figure 7.1 to show a cross-section of the field of view of the left orbit of a human observer. If the reader will put his or her left eve close to the page, one gets an approximation of the sample of the ambient light that the illustrator could see with his head still and his right eye closed. The illustrator was reclining, with his feet up, facing the corner of a room. His nose, lips, and cheek and part of his left arm are represented. The drawing is an updating of one made by Ernst Mach in the 1880s that he entitled "The Visual Ego." What is being illustrated here is the stationary field of view of an eye socket with the head fixed and the eye mobile, not the shifting field of view with a fixed eve and a turning head: the latter is different and will be described later. For this drawing, the artist had to turn his eye in order to see clearly the peripheral details in the field of view.

视野如何定义我们的自我

在这里，我们谈到的「动物的视野」，是指动物的眼睛系统能够捕捉到的周围环境中的光线范围。与我们周围全方位的光信息不同，视野是有限的，就像是从整个球形空间中截取的一个样本。视野的范围主要取决于动物眼睛在头部的位置。有些动物，比如马，眼睛位于头部两侧，拥有接近 360 度的全景视野。而人类等动物的眼睛位于前方，视野范围大约是半球形的（Walls，1942，第 10 章)。虽然这两类动物的双眼视野都在前方有重叠，但人类的重叠程度要远大于那些拥有半全景视觉（semipanoramic vision）的动物。这里我们所说的视野，是指两只眼睛 combined fields of view 的整体视野。

图 7.1 展示了人类左眼视野的横截面。读者可以将左眼靠近页面，这样就能大致体验到插画家在保持头部不动、闭上右眼的情况下所能看到的景象。画面中，插画家正斜躺着，抬起双脚，面对房间的一个角落。我们能看到他的鼻子、嘴唇、脸颊和部分左臂。这幅图是对 Ernst Mach 在 1880 年代绘制的一幅名为「视觉自我」（The Visual Ego）的著名图画的现代诠释。

需要注意的是，这幅图展示的是头部固定但眼球可以移动时的静止视野，而不是眼球固定但头部可以转动时的移动视野。这两种情况是不同的，我们将在后面详细讨论。为了绘制这幅图，艺术家需要转动眼球才能清楚地看到视野边缘的细节。

通过这幅图，我们可以直观地理解到，我们的视野不仅包含了外部世界的信息，也包含了我们自身身体的一部分。这种独特的视角为我们提供了一个重要的参考点，帮助我们定义和感知自我与环境的关系。

A field of view is a large visual solid angle, with an envelope. The important fact about a field of view is its boundaries. vague and indefinite boundaries. to be sure, but still boundaries. They are in some ways like occluding edges, the occluding edges of a window. The edges of the field of view hide the environment behind them. as those of a window do. and when the field moves there is an accretion of optical structure at the leading edge with deletion of structure at the trailing edge, as in the cabin of a steam shovel with a wide front window and controls that enable the operator to turn the cabin to the right or the left. But the edges of the field of view are unlike the edges of a window inasmuch as, for the window, a foreground hides the background whereas, for the field of view, the head of the observer hides the background. Ask yourself what it is that you see hiding the surroundings as you look out upon the world-not darkness surely, not air, not nothing, but the ego! The illustration of course is misleading in this respect.

Whenever a point of observation is occupied by a human, about half of the surrounding world is revealed to the eyes and the remainder is concealed by the head. What is concealed is occluded not by a surface, a projected surface of the sort described when the laws of occluding and occluded surfaces were formulated, but by a unique entity. It is not a part of the world, but it does conform to the principle of reversible occlusion, by which those surfaces that go out of sight with one movement come back into sight with the opposite movement. The head turns. and whatever was in back of the head at one time will be in front of the head at another and vice versa. This fact is fundamental for the theory of perception to be proposed. The purpose of vision, I shall argue, is to be aware of the surroundings, the ambient environment, not merely of the field in front of the eyes. The ambient information is always available to any observer who turns his or her head. Visual perception is panoramic and, over time, the panorama is registered.

There are other remarkable features of the field of view besides its oval boundaries. Still other occluding edges appear within it, those of the nose, the body, the limbs, and the extremities, some of which can be seen in the drawing. The edges of the eye socket, the eyebrows, the nose and cheek bones are only the nearest: the edges of the arms. legs. hands. and feet are more distant. but they still occlude the surfaces of the "outer"environment. The hands and feet behave more like the occluding edges of an object than like the occluding edges of a window; they are actually protrusions into the field of view from below. They are therefore attached objects in the present terminology, but they are attached to the observer, not to the ground, and they are elastic. When these semiobjects move, there is deletion of optical structure at the leading edge and accretion at the trailing edge, just as with objects in the world.

视野：我们看世界的窗口

想象一下，你的视野就像是一个巨大的、形状不规则的窗口，通过它你观察这个世界。这个「窗口」的边缘虽然模糊不清，但确实存在。这些边缘在某种程度上类似于真实窗户的边框，它们遮挡了窗外的景象。当我们转动头部时，视野边缘的景象会发生变化：新的景象会从一侧出现，而另一侧的景象则会消失。这种体验有点像坐在一台带有宽大前窗的挖掘机驾驶舱里，操作员可以左右转动驾驶舱，从而改变视野。

然而，视野的边缘与真实窗户的边框有一个关键区别：窗户边框之外是我们能看到的景象，而视野边缘之外则是被我们的头部遮挡的部分。想象一下，当你环顾四周时，是什么在遮挡周围的环境？不是黑暗，不是空气，也不是虚无，而是你自己！这就是为什么我们的视野总是包含了「自我」的元素。

每当我们观察周围环境时，大约有一半的世界呈现在我们眼前，而另一半则被我们的头部遮挡。这种遮挡不同于普通物体对其他物体的遮挡，因为我们的头部是一个独特的实体。它虽然不是我们所观察的世界的一部分，但它遵循一个有趣的原则：当我们转动头部时，原本被遮挡的部分会重新出现在视野中，而原本可见的部分则会被遮挡。这个现象对于我们理解视觉感知非常重要。

我认为，视觉的主要目的是让我们意识到整个周围环境，而不仅仅是眼前的景象。通过转动头部，我们可以获取全方位的环境信息。随着时间的推移，我们的大脑会将这些片段信息整合成一个完整的全景图像。

除了视野的整体边界外，我们的视野中还存在其他有趣的「遮挡者」。比如我们的鼻子、身体、四肢等。在图中，我们可以看到最接近的遮挡者包括眼窝边缘、眉毛、鼻子和颧骨。稍远一些的是我们的手臂、腿、手和脚，它们同样会遮挡部分外部环境。

有趣的是，我们的手和脚在视野中的表现更像是独立的物体，而不是固定的边框。它们就像是从视野下方伸出的突起物。在我们当前的讨论中，我们可以将它们视为「附属物体」—— 它们附属于观察者（也就是我们自己），而不是附属于地面，并且它们是可以弯曲移动的。当这些身体部位移动时，我们会看到它们遮挡和露出背景的过程，就像我们观察外部世界中的物体移动一样。

通过理解我们的视野及其特性，我们可以更好地认识到我们是如何感知这个世界的，以及我们的身体如何影响这种感知。这不仅帮助我们理解视觉系统的工作原理，也让我们更深入地认识到「自我」在我们世界观中的独特地位。

图 7.1 左眼视角下的自我

这幅图展示了观察者左眼的视野。它来自 James Jerome Gibson 的《视觉世界的感知》一书，经 Greenwood Press，Inc. 授权使用。

Information exists in a normal ambient array, therefore, to specify the near- ness of the parts of the self to the point of observation-first the head, then the body, the limbs, and the extremities. The experience of a central self in the head and a peripheral self in the body is not therefore a mysterious intuition or a philosophical abstraction but has a basis in optical information.

I have described this information for perceiving the self in terms applicable to a human observer, but the description could be applied to an animal without too much change. In all bilaterally symmetrical animals, the eyes are in the head, the head is attached to a body, and (for terrestrial animals) the body is supported by the ground. But the horse and the human look out upon the world in different ways. They have radically different fields of view; their noses are different, and their legs are different, entering and leaving the field of view in different ways. Each species sees a different self from every other. Each indi- vidual sees a different self. Each person gets information about his or her body that differs from that obtained by any other person.

我们周围的视觉环境为我们提供了丰富的信息，让我们能够感知自身各部分与我们观察位置的远近关系。最接近的是我们的头部，然后是身体、四肢，最后是手脚等末端部位。这就解释了为什么我们会感觉到「中心的自我」位于头部，而「外围的自我」分布在身体各处。这种感觉并非神秘的直觉或抽象的哲学概念，而是基于我们接收到的视觉信息。

虽然我主要从人类的角度描述了这种自我感知的过程，但这个概念同样适用于动物，只需稍作调整。所有左右对称的动物（如狗、猫、马等）都有一些共同点：眼睛位于头部，头部连接着身体，而对于陆地动物来说，身体由地面支撑。

然而，不同动物看待世界的方式也存在显著差异。以人和马为例：

1. 视野范围：人的视野较窄但更集中，而马的视野更广阔，几乎可以看到身体两侧的情况。

2. 鼻子：人的鼻子在视野中只占很小一部分，而马的大鼻子在它们的视野中更为突出。

3. 腿：人的腿通常只在视野底部可见，而马的腿因为更长，在它们的视野中可能更显眼，尤其是在低头时。

这些差异意味着每个物种，甚至每个个体，都会看到独特的「自我」。例如，一个高个子和一个矮个子看到的「自我」会有所不同 —— 高个子可能会看到更多的身体，而矮个子的视野中可能会有更多头顶上方的环境。

同样，每个人获得的关于自己身体的视觉信息都是独一无二的。想象一下，一个芭蕾舞者和一个举重运动员看到的自己的手臂和腿会有多么不同！

理解这一点有助于我们认识到，我们每个人都通过独特的「窗口」来观察世界，这个「窗口」不仅展示了外部世界，也呈现了我们自己。这种独特的视角塑造了我们对自我和周围环境的认知，影响着我们与世界互动的方式。

THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FIELD OF VIEW AND THE VISUAL FIELD

The field of view being described here should not be confused with the visual field. As I used the term, the visual field means a kind of introspective experience contrasted with the naive experience of the visual world (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 3). It is the momentary patchwork of visual sensations. But the field of view is a fact of ecological optics.

Actually, there are always two fields of view available to any animal with two eyes. That is, there are two ambient optic arrays at two different points of observation, each of which is sampled by one eye. Since the points of observation are separated by the interocular distance, the optic arrays are different. I term this difference disparity, by analogy with the retinal disparity studied so intensively by physiological image optics.

The difference between the disparity of two array samples and the disparity of two retinal images is considerable. The difference between a theory of disparity as information and the traditional theory of the "fusion" of disparate images is radical. There will be more of this later, especially in Chapters 11 and 12.

视野与视场的区别

这里所描述的视野（field of view）不应与视场（visual field）混淆。按照我的定义，视场是指一种内省经验，与我们日常感知到的视觉世界有所不同（Gibson，1950b，第 3 章)。它可以被理解为我们在某一时刻所感知到的视觉信息的集合。而视野则是生态光学（ecological optics，研究生物与其视觉环境之间相互作用的学科）中的一个客观现象。

实际上，任何拥有两只眼睛的动物都同时拥有两个视野。这意味着在两个不同的观察点上存在两个环境光学信息集合，每只眼睛都会采集其中一个。由于两只眼睛之间存在一定距离，因此这两个光学信息集合是有差异的。我将这种差异称为视差（disparity)，这个概念类似于在生理光学研究中广泛探讨的视网膜视差。

两个光学信息集合样本之间的视差与两个视网膜图像之间的视差有很大不同。将视差视为一种信息的理论与传统的视差图像「融合」理论有着根本的区别。关于这一点，我们将在后面，特别是在第 11 章和第 12 章中进行更详细的讨论。

### 7.2 Nonvisual Information about The self

It is obvious, of course, that perceptual systems other than the visual system are active and that the body is a source of stimulus information for these other so-called senses as well as for vision. Proprioception is either taken to be one of the senses by sensory physiologists or taken to be several related senses, as conceived by Sir Charles Sherrington. A deep theoretical muddle is connected with proprioception. I tried to clear it up in my book on the perceptual systems (Gibson, 1966b) by reformulating the whole meaning of the term sense. In my view, proprioception can be understood as egoreception, as sensitivity to the self, not as one special channel of sensations or as several of them. I maintain that all the perceptual systems are propriosensitive as well as exterosensitive, for they all provide information in their various ways about the observer's activ- ities. The observer's movements usually produce sights and sounds and impres- sions on the skin along with stimulation of the muscles, the joints, and the inner ear. Accordingly, information that is specific to the self is picked up as such, no matter what sensory nerve is delivering impulses to the brain. The point I wish to make is that information about the self is multiple and that all kinds are picked up concurrently. An individual not only sees himself, he hears his foot- steps and his voice, he touches the floor and his tools, and when he touches his own skin he feels both his hand and his skin at the same time. He feels his head turning, his muscles flexing, and his joints bending. He has his own aches, the pressures of his own clothing, the look of his own eyeglasses-in fact, he lives within his own skin.

This theory of information for self-perception, it should be noted, contra- dicts one of the most deep-seated assumptions of traditional sensory physi- ology-the doctrine that a neural input can be specific only to the receptor that initiated it, that is, the doctrine of the specific qualities of the nerves, or specific "nerve energies" as Johannes Müller called them. According to this doctrine, proprioception is ascribed to specialized proprioceptors. But I have rejected this theory of specificity and substituted another that is quite radically different.

关于自我的非视觉信息

显然，除了视觉系统外，其他感知系统也在不断工作，而身体则是为这些所谓的其他感官以及视觉提供刺激信息的源头。在感觉生理学领域，本体感受（proprioception）要么被视为一种感官，要么按照 Sir Charles Sherrington 的观点，被认为是几种相关的感官。然而，围绕本体感受的理论存在着深层次的混乱。在我关于感知系统的著作中（Gibson，1966b），我试图通过重新定义「感官」这个术语来厘清这一混乱。我认为，本体感受可以被理解为自我感受（egoreception），是对自我的一种敏感性，而不是某个特定的感觉通道或几个感觉通道的组合。

我主张，所有的感知系统既能感知自身，也能感知外界，因为它们都以各自的方式提供关于观察者活动的信息。观察者的动作通常会产生视觉和听觉刺激，以及皮肤上的触感，同时还会刺激肌肉、关节和内耳。因此，无论是哪个感觉神经向大脑传递信号，与自我相关的信息都会被准确捕捉。我想强调的是，关于自我的信息是多方面的，而且所有类型的信息都是同时被感知的。一个人不仅能看到自己，还能听到自己的脚步声和说话声，能触摸到地面和手中的工具，当他触摸自己的皮肤时，能同时感受到手和被触摸的皮肤。他能感觉到头部的转动，肌肉的收缩，关节的弯曲。他能感受到自己的疼痛，衣服的压力，眼镜的存在 —— 事实上，他生活在自己的皮肤之中。

值得注意的是，这种关于自我感知信息的理论与传统感觉生理学中一个最根深蒂固的假设相矛盾。这个假设就是 Johannes Müller 所称的神经特异性学说或特定「神经能量」学说，即神经输入只能对应于激活它的特定受体。根据这一学说，本体感受被认为源于专门的本体感受器。然而，我已经否定了这种特异性理论，并提出了一种完全不同的新理论。

### 7.3 Egoreception and Exteroception are Inseparable

The optical information to specify the self, including the head, body, arms, and hands, accompanies the optical information to specify the environment. The two sources of information coexist. The one could not exist without the other. When a man sees the world, he sees his nose at the same time; or rather, the world and his nose are both specified and his awareness can shift. Which of the two he notices depends on his attitude; what needs emphasis now is that information is available for both.

The supposedly separate realms of the subjective and the objective are actually only poles of attention. The dualism of observer and environment is unnecessary. The Optical Information for Self-Perception 109 The information for the perception of "here"is of the same kind as the inform- ation for the perception of "there,"and a continuous layout of surfaces extends from one to the other. This fact can be noted in Figure 7.1. What I called gradients in 1950，the gradients of increasing density of texture, of increasing binocular disparity, and of decreasing motility that specify increasing distance all the way from the observer's nose out to the horizon, are actually variables between two limits, implying just this complementarity of proprioception and exteroception in perception. Self-perception and environment perception go together.

自我感知与外部感知密不可分

用于识别自我（包括头部、身体、手臂和手）的视觉信息与用于识别环境的视觉信息是同时存在的。这两种信息源相互依存，缺一不可。当一个人观察世界时，他同时也能看到自己的鼻子；更准确地说，世界和他的鼻子都呈现在他的视野中，而他的注意力可以在两者之间切换。他关注哪一个取决于他当时的心态；我们现在需要强调的是，这两种信息都是可以被感知到的。

所谓分离的主观和客观领域实际上只是我们注意力关注的两个极端。我们不需要将观察者和环境截然分开。自我感知的视觉信息与环境感知的视觉信息是同一类型的，从「此处」到「彼处」存在着一个连续的表面布局。这一点可以在图 7.1 中得到体现。我在 1950 年提出的梯度概念，包括指示从观察者鼻子到地平线不断增加距离的纹理密度增加梯度、双眼视差增加梯度和运动性减少梯度，实际上是两个极限之间的变量。这恰恰说明了在感知过程中，本体感受（对自身的感知）和外部感受（对环境的感知）是相互补充的。自我感知和环境感知是同时进行的。

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE HEAD IS TILTED?

In a chapter entitled "The Problem of the Stable and Boundless Visual World" (Gibson, 1950), I put the question of why, when one tilts the head, the world does not appear to tilt but remains visibly upright. Is it now clear that the question was misconceived? It has long been a puzzle for theories of visual perception based on the input from the retina. No satisfactory answer has been agreed upon. (Psychology is plagued with efforts to find answers to the wrong questions!)

What happens when your head is tilted is simply that you are aware of it. The change of retinal stimulation is exactly concomitant with changes in the stimulation coming from muscles and joints and from the inner ear, and these all specify the same fact. The tilt of the retina behind the normal retinal image is observed, whereas the tilt of a hypothetical pattern of input relative to the receptor mosaic is not noticed. Why should it be? Curious anomalies will arise, to be sure, if the information got by the visual system is discrepant with that obtained by the muscle-joint system, or the vestibular system, for then the observer is uncertain what to mean by the word tilt; he is confused, and the results of the experiment are open to many interpretations.

Efforts to answer the question of why the world looks upright, stable, and unbounded despite all the vicissitudes of the retinal input are still going on. Up-to-date knowledge of this research can be obtained by reading Stability and Constancy in Visual Perception (Epstein, 1977). This is an admirable book if you accept its premises.

头部倾斜时我们的感知会发生什么变化？

在我的著作《视觉世界的稳定性和无限性问题》（Gibson，1950）中，我提出了这样一个问题：为什么当我们倾斜头部时，我们看到的世界并不会倾斜，而是保持竖直？现在我们是否可以认识到，这个问题本身可能就是错误的？长期以来，这个问题一直困扰着那些基于视网膜接收信息的视觉感知理论。至今我们仍未找到一个令人满意的答案。（心理学经常陷入为错误的问题寻找答案的困境！）

实际上，当你倾斜头部时发生的事情很简单：你意识到了这个动作。视网膜接收到的刺激变化与来自肌肉、关节和内耳（前庭系统）的刺激变化是同步的，它们都传达了同一个信息。我们能够感知到正常视网膜图像背后的视网膜倾斜，而不会注意到相对于感光细胞排列的假设输入模式的倾斜。为什么要注意后者呢？当然，如果视觉系统获得的信息与肌肉-关节系统或前庭系统（负责平衡感的内耳系统）获得的信息不一致，就会出现一些奇怪的现象。在这种情况下，观察者会对「倾斜」这个概念感到困惑，实验结果也可能有多种解释。

尽管视网膜接收的信息不断变化，但关于为什么我们看到的世界始终是竖直的、稳定的和无边界的，这个问题的研究仍在继续。如果你想了解这方面研究的最新进展，可以阅读《视觉感知的稳定性和恒常性》(Epstein，1977）。如果你接受该书的基本假设，你会发现这是一本非常有价值的著作。

### 7.4 The Information for the Perceiving of Distance

The problem of how distance can be perceived is very old. If it is taken to be the distance of an object in space, then it is "a line endwise to the eye," as Bishop Berkeley pointed out in 1709, and it projects only one point on the retina. Hence, distance of itselfis invisible and, if so, a whole set of perplexities arise that have never been resolved. Distance may be thought of, however, as extending along the ground instead of through the air, and then it is not invisible. It is projected as a gradient of the decreasing optical size and increasing optical density of the features of the ground, as I argued in 1950. But this gradient of forms getting smaller and finer and more closely packed together has a limit at the horizon of the earth where, according to the laws of natural perspective, all visual solid angles shrink to zero. The gradient is also anchored at another limit, by the forms projected from the nose, body, and limbs. The nose projects at the maximum of nearness just as the horizon projects at the maximum of farness.

Distance therefore is not a line endwise to the eye as Bishop Berkeley thought. To think so is to confuse abstract geometrical space with the living space of the environment. It is to confuse the Z-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system with the number of paces along the ground to a fixed object.

The nose is here. It projects the largest possible visual solid angle in the optic array. Not only that, it provides the maximum of crossed double imagery or crossed disparity in the dual array, for it is the farthest possible edge to the right in the left eye's field of view and the farthest possible edge to the left in the right eye's field of view. This also says that to look at the nose one must converge the two eyes maximally. Finally, the so-called motion parallax of the nose is an absolute maximum, which is to say that, of all the occluding edges in the world, the edge of the nose sweeps across the surfaces behind it at the greatest rate whenever the observer moves or turns his head. For each of the three kinds of optical gradient that I proposed as "stimuli" for seeing depth in The Perception of the Visual World (Gibson, 19506)-size perspective, disparity perspective, and motion perspective- the nose provides an absolute base line, the absolute zero of distance-from-here.

我们如何感知距离？

人类如何感知距离一直是一个古老的问题。如果我们将距离理解为空间中物体到观察者的距离，那么正如 Bishop Berkeley 在 1709 年指出的，它就像「一条朝向眼睛的线」，在视网膜上只形成一个点。因此，距离本身是不可见的。如果真是这样，就会产生一系列至今未解的困惑。然而，如果我们将距离理解为沿地面延伸而不是穿过空气，那么它就不是不可见的。正如我在 1950 年所论述的，它在视觉上表现为地面特征的大小逐渐减小和密度逐渐增加的渐变。但这种形式逐渐变小、变细、变密的渐变在地球的地平线处达到极限，根据自然透视原理，所有的视觉角度在那里都缩小到零。这个渐变的另一个极限则是由我们的鼻子、身体和四肢所形成的。鼻子代表了最近的距离，就像地平线代表了最远的距离一样。

因此，距离并不是 Bishop Berkeley 所认为的朝向眼睛的一条线。这种想法混淆了抽象的几何空间和我们生活的实际环境空间。这相当于把笛卡尔坐标系的 Z 轴和实际行走到某个物体所需的步数混为一谈。

我们的鼻子就在眼前。在我们的视野中，它占据了最大的视角。不仅如此，它在我们的双眼视野中提供了最大的交叉双重影像或交叉视差，因为它在左眼视野中是最右边的边缘，在右眼视野中是最左边的边缘。这也意味着要看到鼻子，我们必须将两眼聚焦到最近的距离。最后，鼻子的运动视差（物体相对背景的视觉移动）是最大的，这意味着，在所有可能遮挡视线的物体边缘中，每当我们移动或转动头部时，鼻子的边缘相对于背后的物体移动得最快。

在我的著作《视觉世界的感知》(Gibson，1950b）中，我提出了三种用于感知深度的视觉线索：大小透视（物体看起来随距离变小）、视差透视（两眼看到的图像差异）和运动透视（移动时物体相对背景的视觉变化）。对于这三种线索，鼻子都提供了一个绝对的参考点，即距离的绝对零点。

### 7.5 The Specifying of Head Turning

The head can be turned as well as displaced. Turning the head is looking around; displacing it is locomotion. The head can be turned on a vertical axis as in looking from side to side, on a horizontal axis as in looking up and down, and even on a sagittal axis as in tilting the head. The sky will always enter the field in looking up, and the ground will always enter the field in looking down. Three pairs of semicircular canals in the vestibule of the inner ear, set in place relative to the three axes, register these turns and specify the degree of head rotation. This fact is well known and has been widely studied. What is not so familiar is the fact that these turns of the head are also registered by vision. They are specified by what I have called the sweeping of the field of view over the ambient array during head turns and the wheeling of the field over the array during head tilts. The sweeping and wheeling of this window with its special private occluding edges are not simply "motions" but deletions and accretions of optical structure. To say only that the field of view "moves"over the world as the head moves is inexact and insufficient; the world is revealed and concealed as the head moves, in ways that specify exactly how the head moves. Whatever goes out of sight as the head turns right comes into sight as the head turns left; whatever goes out of sight as the head is lifted comes into sight as the head is lowered. The optical texture that is deleted is subsequently accreted. It is invariant under this reversible optical change. It conforms to the principle of reversible occlusion.

The temporary field of view of an eye socket is a sample of the ambient optic array, and the head is continually sampling the array. Each sample is a segment that overlaps with earlier and later segments. Moreover, it is a changing segment with elements being progressively included and excluded at the margins. And in a sufficiently long sequence of these segments, the whole structure of the array is specified.

The combined field of view of two eye sockets (and all higher animals have two eyes) consists of two samples of the ambient array. They overlap more or less, more in humans than in horses, and thus the same structure is included in both segments. But it is not quite the same structure, because the two points of observation are slightly separated and there is a resulting disparity of the two structures. This disparity, or mismatch, is at a maximum for the contour projected from the edge of the animal's nose, as I pointed out above. The edge of the nose is the left-hand edge of what the right eye sees but the right-hand edge of what the left eye sees, and this maximum mismatch constitutes inform- ation for the zero of distance, that is, for the awareness of oneself at the center of a layout of surfaces receding from here. The minimum of mismatch is at the horizon. There will be more about disparity later.

头部运动如何帮助我们感知世界

我们的头部可以转动，也可以移动位置。转动头部让我们能够环顾四周，而移动位置则是我们在空间中的运动。头部可以在不同方向上转动：左右转动（如从一侧看到另一侧），上下转动（如仰望天空或低头看地），甚至可以侧倾。当我们抬头时，天空就会进入视野；当我们低头时，地面就会出现在视野中。在我们的内耳中，有三对半圆形管道（称为半规管）分别对应这三个转动方向，它们能够感知并记录头部的转动。这一点已经被广泛研究和认知。

然而，较少为人所知的是，我们的视觉系统也能感知这些头部运动。当我们转动头部时，视野会在周围环境中扫过；当我们倾斜头部时，视野则会在环境中旋转。这种视野的变化不仅仅是简单的「运动」，而是我们所看到的景象的消失和出现。仅仅说视野随着头部移动而「移动」是不够准确的。事实上，随着头部的移动，世界在我们眼中被揭示和隐藏，而这种变化恰恰反映了头部是如何移动的。当头部向右转时消失的景象，在头部向左转时就会重新出现；当抬头时消失的景象，在低头时又会重新进入视野。这种视觉信息的消失和出现是可逆的，符合我们称之为「可逆遮挡原理」的规律。

我们的每只眼睛在任何时刻看到的景象都是周围环境的一个样本。随着头部的不断移动，我们在持续地采集这些样本。每个新的视野样本都与之前和之后的样本有所重叠。而且，这个样本是不断变化的，边缘处的景象在不断地进入和离开我们的视野。通过一系列足够长的这种采样，我们就能构建出整个周围环境的完整图像。

对于大多数高等动物（包括人类）来说，我们有两只眼睛，因此同时获得了环境的两个样本。这两个样本有很大程度的重叠，人类的重叠程度比马等动物更大。虽然两只眼睛看到的大致是相同的景象，但由于两只眼睛的位置稍有不同，它们看到的图像也略有差异。这种差异我们称之为「视差」。视差在我们鼻子的边缘处最为明显：右眼看到鼻子的左侧边缘，而左眼看到的是右侧边缘。这种最大的差异为我们提供了一个重要的信息：它定义了距离的零点，让我们意识到自己处于周围环境的中心。而在远处的地平线，这种视差差异最小。关于视差的更多内容，我们稍后会详细讨论。

FIGURE 7.2 A sequence of overlapping fields of view obtained by turning the head to the right (continued overleaf).

This is the same room and the same man as in Figure 7.1, except that his feet are now lined up with the window instead of with the corner of the room. The head turns through an angle of about 90°. His nose is always at the right-hand edge of the field. The field of view is a sliding sample of the ambient array.

### 7.6 The Specifying of Limb Movements

Consider in more detail the protrusions into the field of view of those complex shapes with deforming outlines that are the projections of the limbs and extremities of the observer's body. They normally enter and leave the field at its lower edge, or else the field sweeps down to reveal them. They are almost never at rest. They specify objects in some ways, but of course they are only semiob- jects. I am tempted to call them subjective objects, and this paradox would emphasize the fact that no line can be drawn between the subjective and the objective. In the primate and the human, the five-pronged shapes that specify the hands are especially meaningful. Their deforming contours and the under- lying invariants make possible what psychologists have called, very inad- equately, eye-hand coordination. More exactly, they are the basis of the visual control of manipulation. And when an object grasped by the hand is used as a tool, it becomes a sort of extension of the hand, almost a part of the body.

Infants, both monkey and human, practice looking at their hands for hours, as well they should, for the disturbances of optical structure that specify the niceties of prehension have to be distinguished. All manipulations, from the crudest act of grasping by the infant to the finest act of assembly by the watch- maker, must be guided by optical disturbances if they are to be successful. Some kinds of transformations and occlusions were listed in the last chapter.

The optical minification of the squirming silhouette of the hand specifies extension of the arm, reaching out, while optical magnification specifies flection of the arm, pulling in. A hand occludes progressively less of the environment as it recedes and progressively more of the environment as it approaches. A certain nonsymmetrical magnification of the hand will bring it to the mouth, as every baby learns. A symmetrical magnification of the hand will cause it to cover the eyes so that nothing can be seen. But then, of course, one can peek through the fingers, which is not only pleasurable but a lesson in practical optics.

我们如何感知自身的四肢运动

让我们仔细考虑一下，当我们的四肢和身体末端进入视野时，它们在视觉上呈现出怎样的特征。这些部位通常从视野的下方边缘进入或离开，或者当我们低头看时才能看到。它们几乎总是在运动中。在某些方面，它们像是物体，但又不完全是物体。我倾向于称它们为「主观物体」，这个看似矛盾的说法强调了主观和客观之间界限的模糊性。对于灵长类动物和人类来说，手的形状尤其重要。手的形状变化和某些不变的特征使得我们所说的「眼手协调」成为可能。更准确地说，这些视觉信息是我们用视觉控制手部动作的基础。当我们用手握住一个物体并将其作为工具使用时，这个物体就仿佛成了手的延伸，几乎成为身体的一部分。

猴子和人类的婴儿都会花很长时间看着自己的手，这是很有必要的。因为要学会精确控制手的动作，就必须能够辨别手部运动带来的视觉变化。从婴儿粗糙的抓握动作到钟表匠精细的组装工作，所有的操作如果要成功，都必须依靠视觉反馈来引导。在上一章中，我们列举了一些视觉变化和遮挡的类型。

当我们的手在视野中变小时，这表示我们的手臂正在伸展，向外伸出；当手在视野中变大时，这表示我们的手臂正在弯曲，向内收回。当手远离我们时，它遮挡的背景逐渐减少；当手接近我们时，它遮挡的背景逐渐增多。婴儿会学会如何通过视觉判断手的位置，比如，当手以某种特定方式在视野中变大时，这意味着手正在接近嘴巴。如果手对称地在视野中变大，最后可能会完全遮住视线，什么也看不见。但是，我们当然可以从手指间偷看，这不仅有趣，还是一堂生动的实用光学课。

The visual solid angle of the hand cannot be reduced below a certain minimum: the visual solid angle of a detached obiect like a ball can be made very small by throwing it. These ranges of magnification and minification between limits link up the extremes of here and out there. the body and the world, and constitute another bridge between the subjective and the objective.

You might think that contact of the hand or foot with a surface during extension of the limb is specified by a mechanical impression on the skin, by touch, and that there would be no use for an optical specification as well. Nevertheless, there is such optical specification. When the decreasing occlusion of the surface by the extremity ceases, and when there is no accretion or deletion of surface texture by the occluding edges of the hand or foot, then the extremity is in contact with the surface and not sliding over it. This specifies, for example, that the foot is on the ground. Terrestrial animals are accustomed to have their feet on the ground and to have both cutaneous and optical information for this state of affairs. This explains why an invisible glass floor high above the real floor supplies mechanical support but not optical support, and why it is that human infants and other terrestrial animals show distress, flinching and behaving as if falling, when placed on such a transparent floor (Chapter 9).

These are a few examples of the rules that make visual egoreception so useful. The surfaces of the hands, of the tools held by the hands, and the working surfaces that they alter are all given as a changing layout of the nearby environment, the information for which is contained in the changing structure of the optic arrays at the two eyes.

手的视觉立体角（visual solid angle）无法缩小到某个最小值以下：而像球这样的独立物体的视觉立体角可以通过投掷变得非常小。这种在一定范围内的放大和缩小效果，连接了「此处」和「彼处」的极端，也就是身体和世界，构成了主观和客观之间的另一座桥梁。

你可能会认为，当手或脚在伸展过程中与表面接触时，这种接触是通过皮肤上的机械压力来感知的，也就是通过触觉，似乎不需要视觉感知。然而，事实上确实存在视觉感知。当身体末端（如手或脚）对表面的遮挡减少到停止时，如果手或脚的边缘没有造成表面纹理的增加或消失，那么就意味着身体末端与表面接触，而不是在表面上滑动。这种视觉感知可以告诉我们，比如说，脚已经踏在地面上了。陆地动物习惯于将脚放在地面上，并通过皮肤和视觉两种方式获取这种状态的信息。这就解释了为什么在真实地板上方高处的透明玻璃地板虽然提供了物理支撑，但却没有提供视觉上的支撑。这也解释了为什么人类婴儿和其他陆地动物被放在这样的透明地板上时会表现出痛苦，畏缩，仿佛在坠落（详见第 9 章）。

以上只是一些使视觉自我感知（visual egoreception）如此有用的规则示例。手的表面、手持工具的表面以及它们作用的工作表面都被视为近距离环境中不断变化的布局，这些信息都包含在两只眼睛接收到的不断变化的光学阵列（optic arrays）结构中。

### 7.7 The Specifying of Locomotion

At a moving point of observation no less than a stationary point of observation, the ambient array is sampled by the observer, who can look around the world while moving as well as while stationary. The edges of the observer's field of view will sweep over the flowing ambient array in the same way that they sweep over the frozen ambient array. A person can face backward while riding in a vehicle, or walk backward for that matter, and observe how the array flows inward. instead of outward as it does when one faces forward.

If we consider for the present an open environment, one that is not cluttered, locomotion is specified by flow of the array and rest by nonflow. The flow is a change in perspective structure, a change in the perspectives of the ground if outdoors and of the floor, walls, and ceiling if indoors. There is not only a static perspective of the array but also a motion perspective, as I once called it (Gibson, Olum, and Rosenblatt, 1955). This will be described, along with experiments, in Chapter 9. The main law of flowing perspective is that it is centrifugal in half the array and centripetal in the other half, but these two hemispheres are not invariant. They shift around and thus are not to be confused with the permanent hemispheres of earth and sky. More particularly, a focus of centrifugal outflow is always accompanied by another focus of centripetal inflow at the opposite pole of the sphere. This axis is the line of the displacement of the observer. Hence, the focus of expansion is the direction in which one is going, and the focus of contraction is the direction from which one is coming. This direction may change during locomotion, of course, relative to the permanent environment of earth and sky, and the two foci of inflow and outflow may change correspondingly relative to other invariants of the ambient array.

I have distinguished between invariant structure and perspective structure in Chapter 5. The invariant structure of the array that specifies the persisting world underlies the changing perspective structure. The pattern of outflow and inflow is superposed, as it were, on the nonchanging features of the array. One of these non-changing features is the earth-sky contrast at the horizon, and another is the texture of the earth. The flow pattern shifts as the observer changes direction, now in one direction and then another, and reverses when the direction is reversed, but the invariants of structure and texture never shift. They specify the unmoving terrain, whereas the flow pattern specifies the observer's locomotion with reference to the terrain.

运动的感知

无论是在移动还是静止的观察点，观察者都能感知周围的光学阵列（ambient array）。观察者可以在移动和静止时环顾四周，视野边缘会扫过流动的光学阵列，就像扫过静止的光学阵列一样。一个人可以在乘车时面向后方，或者倒着走，观察光学阵列如何向内流动，而不是像面向前方时那样向外流动。

暂且考虑一个开放、整洁的环境。在这种环境中，运动是由光学阵列的流动来指示的，而静止则由光学阵列的不流动来指示。这种流动体现为透视结构（perspective structure）的变化，户外时表现为地面透视的变化，室内则表现为地板、墙壁和天花板透视的变化。除了静态透视，还存在我曾称之为运动透视（motion perspective）的现象（Gibson，Olum，and Rosenblatt，1955）。这将在第 9 章中与相关实验一起详细描述。

流动透视的主要规律是，它在光学阵列的一半呈现离心流动，在另一半呈现向心流动，但这两个半球并非固定不变。它们会随观察者的运动而移动，因此不应与永恒的地球和天空半球混淆。更具体地说，离心外流的焦点总是伴随着球体对侧的向心内流焦点。这个轴线代表了观察者移动的方向。因此，扩张焦点（focus of expansion）指示了一个人前进的方向，而收缩焦点（focus of contraction）则指示了一个人来时的方向。当然，这个方向在运动过程中可能会相对于地球和天空的永久环境而改变，内流和外流的两个焦点也可能会相应地相对于周围光学阵列的其他不变特征而改变。

我在第 5 章中区分了不变结构（invariant structure）和透视结构。指示持续存在的世界的光学阵列的不变结构是变化的透视结构的基础。外流和内流的模式可以说是叠加在光学阵列的不变特征上的。这些不变特征之一是地平线处的地球-天空对比，另一个是地球表面的纹理。当观察者改变方向时，流动模式会随之变化，可能先是一个方向，然后是另一个方向，当方向反转时流动也会反转，但结构和纹理的不变特征永远不会改变。这些不变特征指示了静止的地形，而流动模式则指示了观察者相对于地形的运动。

How do we see where we are going? We guide or steer our locomotion, when we are in control of it, by locating those invariant features of the array that specify a destination, whatever it may be, and then keeping the focus of optical outflow centered on that item. In short, we magnify the form that specifies the goal. A child runs to his mother by enlarging her image to the limit, that is, to the largest possible solid angle; a bee flies to a flower by precisely the same rule. The rule is related to the principle of what I have called the "symmetricalizing"of stimulation (Gibson, 1966b, pp. 72 ff.). We shall return to this problem in Part III, where we will also consider the control of locomotion to a hidden destination.

The centrifugal outflow of the array that specifies locomotion does not interfere with the information that specifies surface layout; the invariants are all the better for the transformation. The moving self and the unmoving world are reciprocal aspects of the same perception. To say that one perceives an outflow of the world ahead and an inflow of the world behind as one moves forward in the environment would be quite false. One experiences a rigid world and a flowing array. The optical flow of the ambient array is almost never perceived as motion; it is simply experienced as kinesthesis, that is egolocomotion (Warren, 1976).

Consider, finally, an environment with hidden surfaces. An open environment projects a continuous flow pattern to the eye of a moving observer, but a cluttered environment does not. The existence of occluding edges brings about the revealing and concealing of surfaces and the incrementing and decre- menting of the corresponding optical textures. This kind of change is not a flow or a transformation, because the units of the array, some of them, do not map from preceding to succeeding arrays. The invariants that specify the layout of the real environment, then, are not simply invariants under projective trans- formations. There will be more of this in Part III.

How is this optical flow related to classical kinesthesis, which is supposed to be the sense of movement? A person who walks or runs or rides a bicycle does get sensations from the muscles and joints that specify movement. All I propose is that visual kinesthesis should be recognized along with muscle-joint kines- thesis. The latter does not function during passive locomotion in a vehicle. Visual kinesthesis yields the only reliable information about displacement. The classical sense of movement is not trustworthy, for a fish in a stream and a bird in a wind have to exercise their muscles and joints strenuously merely to stay in the same place. The animal is moving in one meaning but not in another. Locomotion with respect to the earth, active or passive, is registered by vision (this will be elaborated in Chapter 10), but supplementary information about the movement of a limb relative to the body is picked up by the haptic system (Gibson, 1966b, Ch.4).

我们如何看到自己要去的方向？当我们能控制自己的运动时，我们通过定位那些指示目的地的光学阵列（optical array）不变特征来引导或操控我们的运动。无论目的地是什么，我们都会保持光学外流的焦点集中在目标上。简而言之，我们放大指示目标的视觉形态。例如，一个孩子跑向他的母亲时，会将母亲的影像放大到极限，也就是最大可能的视角（solid angle)；一只蜜蜂飞向一朵花时，也遵循完全相同的规则。这个规则与我所称的视觉刺激「对称化」（symmetricalizing）原则有关（Gibson，1966b，pp. 72 ff.）。我们将在第三部分进一步探讨这个问题，包括如何控制运动到隐藏的目的地。

指示运动的光学阵列的离心外流不会干扰指示表面布局的信息；相反，这种变换使得不变特征更加明显。移动的自我和静止的世界是同一感知的互补方面。认为一个人在环境中向前移动时感知到前方世界的外流和后方世界的内流是完全错误的。实际上，一个人体验到的是一个稳定的世界和一个流动的光学阵列。周围光学阵列的流动几乎从未被感知为运动；它只是被体验为动觉（kinesthesis），即自我运动感（egolocomotion)（Warren，1976）。

最后，让我们考虑一个有隐藏表面的环境。一个开放的环境会向移动观察者的眼睛投射连续的流动模式，但杂乱的环境则不会。遮挡边缘（occluding edges）的存在会导致表面的显露和隐藏，以及相应光学纹理的增加和减少。这种变化不是简单的流动或转换，因为光学阵列的某些部分不会从前一个状态直接映射到后续状态。因此，指示真实环境布局的不变特征不仅仅是投射变换（projective transformations）下的不变量。我们将在第三部分更详细地讨论这个问题。

那么，这种光学流动与传统认知中的动觉（被认为是运动感）有何关系？走路、跑步或骑自行车的人确实会从肌肉和关节获得指示运动的感觉。我提出的观点是，视觉动觉应该与肌肉-关节动觉一起被认可。后者在车辆中的被动运动中不起作用，而视觉动觉提供了关于位移的唯一可靠信息。传统的运动感并不总是可靠的，例如，溪流中的鱼和风中的鸟必须努力地运动肌肉和关节，仅仅是为了停留在原地。在这种情况下，动物在一种意义上在移动，但在另一种意义上却没有移动。相对于地球的运动，无论是主动还是被动，都主要由视觉系统感知（这将在第 10 章详细阐述）。而关于肢体相对于身体移动的补充信息则是由触觉系统（haptic system）获取的（Gibson，1966b，Ch.4）。

The flow velocities are plotted exactly in Figure 13.1.

值得注意的是，我们通过触觉系统来感知身体相对于肢体的运动（Gibson，1966b，第 4 章）。

### Summary

Information about the self accompanies information about the environment, and the two are inseparable. Egoreception accompanies exteroception, like the other side of a coin. Perception has two poles, the subjective and the objective, and information is available to specify both. One perceives the environment and coperceives oneself.

The edges of the field of view occlude the outer environment, and, as the head turns, the occlusion changes, revealing what was concealed and concealing what was revealed. The same thing happens with locomotion as with head turning. The rule is, whatever goes out of sight comes into sight, and whatever comes into sight goes out of sight. Thus it is that a stationary and permanent environment is specified along with a moving observer, one who looks around, moves about, and does things with his hands and feet.

Three types of movement have been distinguished —— head turning relative to the body, limb movement relative to the body, and locomotion relative to the environment. Each has a unique type of optical information to specify it: the sweeping of the field of view over the ambient array in the case of head turning; the protrusion of special shapes into the field of view in the case of limb movement (especially manipulation); and the flow of the ambient array in the case oflocomotion. The pickup of this information, I propose, should in all cases be called visual kinesthesis. 

关于自我的信息与关于环境的信息是密不可分的，就像硬币的两面。自我感知（egoreception）总是伴随着外部感知（exteroception）。感知包含主观和客观两个方面，而我们可以获取到与这两个方面相关的信息。换句话说，当我们感知环境时，也在同时感知自己。

我们的视野边缘会遮挡部分外部环境。当我们转动头部时，这种遮挡会发生变化：原本被遮挡的部分会显露出来，而原本可见的部分则会被遮挡。同样的现象也发生在我们移动身体时。简单来说，当某些东西从视野中消失时，其他东西就会进入视野；当某些东西进入视野时，其他东西就会从视野中消失。这种现象使我们能够感知到静止不变的环境，以及在环境中移动的自己 —— 一个可以环顾四周、四处走动、用手脚做事的观察者。

我们可以将运动分为三种类型：头部相对于身体的转动、肢体相对于身体的运动，以及身体相对于环境的运动（即位移）。每种运动都有其独特的视觉信息特征：

1. 头部转动时，我们的视野会在环境中扫描；

2. 肢体运动（尤其是手部操作）时，特定形状会突然进入视野；

3. 身体位移时，我们会感受到环境视觉信息的整体流动。

我建议将这些视觉信息的获取过程统称为「视觉动觉」（visual kinesthesis)。这个概念强调了视觉在感知自身运动中的重要作用。
