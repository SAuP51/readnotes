## 14. The Theory of Information Pickup and Its Consequences



In this book the traditional theories of perception have been abandoned. The perennial doctrine that two-dimensional images are restored to three- dimensional reality by a process called depth perception will not do. Neither will the doctrine that the images are transformed by the cues for distance and slant so as to yield constancy of size and shape in the perception of objects. The deep-seated notion of the retinal image as a still picture has been abandoned.

The simple assumption that perceptions of the world are caused by stimuli from the world will not do. The more sophisticated assumption that perceptions of the world are caused when sensations triggered by stimuli are supplemented by memories will not do either. Not even the assumption that a sequence of stimuli is converted into a phenomenal scene by memory will do. The very notion of stimulation as typically composed of discrete stimuli has been abandoned.

The established theory that exteroception and proprioception arise when exteroceptors and proprioceptors are stimulated will not do. The doctrine of special channels of sensation corresponding to specific nerve bundles has been abandoned.

The belief of empiricists that the perceived meanings and values of things are supplied from the past experience of the observer will not do. But even worse is the belief of nativists that meanings and values are supplied from the past experience of the race by way of innate ideas. The theory that meaning is attached to experience or imposed on it has been abandoned.

Not even the current theory that the inputs of the sensory channels are subject to "cognitive processing"will do. The inputs are described in terms of inform- ation theory, but the processes are described in terms of old-fashioned mental acts: recognition, interpretation, inference, concepts, ideas, and storage and retrieval ofideas. These are still the operations of the mind upon the deliverances 228 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

of the senses, and there are too many perplexities entailed in this theory. It will not do, and the approach should be abandoned.

What sort of theory, then, will explain perception? Nothing less than one based on the pickup of information. To this theory, even in its undeveloped state, we should now turn.

Let us remember once again that it is the perception of the environment that we wish to explain. If we were content to explain only the perception of forms or pictures on a surface, of nonsense figures to which meanings must be attached, of discrete stimuli imposed on an observer willy-nilly, in short, the items most often presented to an observer in the laboratory, the traditional theories might prove to be adequate and would not have to be abandoned. But we should not be content with that limited aim. It leaves out of account the eventful world and the perceiver's awareness of being in the world. The labor- atory does not have to be limited to simple stimuli, so-called. The experiments reported in Chapters 9 and 10 showed that information can be displayed.

What is New About the Pickup of Information?

The theory of information pickup differs radically from the traditional theories of perception. First, it involves a new notion of perception, not just a new theory of the process. Second, it involves a new assumption about what there is to be perceived. Third, it involves a new conception of the information for perception, with two kinds always available, one about the environment and another about the self. Fourth, it requires the new assumption of perceptual systems with overlapping functions, each having outputs to adjustable organs as well as inputs from organs. We are especially concerned with vision, but none of the systems, listening, touching, smelling, or tasting, is a channel of sense. Finally, fifth, optical information pickup entails an activity of the system not heretofore imagined by any visual scientist, the concurrent registering of both persistence and change in the flow of structured stimulation. This is the crux of the theory but the hardest part to explicate, because it can be phrased in different ways and a terminology has to be invented.

Consider these five novelties in order, ending with the problem of detecting variants and invariants or change and nonchange.

A Redefinition of Perception

Perceiving is an achievement of the individual, not an appearance in the theater of his consciousness. It is a keeping-in-touch with the world, an experiencing of things rather than a having of experiences. It involves awareness-of instead of just awareness. It may be awareness of something in the environment or something in the observer or both at once, but there is no content of awareness independent of that of which one is aware. This is close to the act psychology of The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 229 the nineteenth century except that perception is not a mental act. Neither is it a bodily act. Perceiving is a psychosomatic act, not of the mind or of the body but of a living observer.

The act of picking up information, moreover, is a continuous act, an activity that is ceaseless and unbroken. The sea of energy in which we live flows and changes without sharp breaks. Even the tiny fraction of this energy that affects the receptors in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin is a flux, not a sequence. The exploring, orienting, and adjusting of these organs sink to a minimum during sleep but do not stop dead. Hence, perceiving is a stream, and William James's description of the stream of consciousness (1890, Ch. 9)applies to it. Discrete percepts, like discrete ideas, are "as mythical as the Jack of Spades."

The continuous act of perceiving involves the coperceiving of the self. At least, that is one way to put it. The very term perception must be redefined to allow for this fact, and the word proprioception must be given a different meaning than it was given by Sherrington.

A New Assertion About What is Perceived

My description of the environment (Chapters 1-3) and of the changes that can occur in it (Chapter 6) implies that places, attached objects, objects, and substances are what are mainly perceived, together with events, which are changes of these things. To see these things is to perceive what they afford. This is very different from the accepted categories of what there is to perceive as described in the textbooks. Color, form, location, space, time, and motion- these are the chapter headings that have been handed down through the centuries, but they are not what is perceived.

Places

A place is one of many adjacent places that make up the habitat and, beyond that. the whole environment. But smaller places are nested within larger places. They do not have boundaries, unless artificial boundaries are imposed by surveyors (my piece of land, my town, my country, my state). A place at one level is what you can see from here or hereabouts, and locomotion consists of going from place to place in this sense (Chapter 11). A very important kind of learning for animals and children is place-learning-learning the affordances of places and learning to distinguish among them-and way-finding, which culminate in the state of being oriented to the whole habitat and knowing where one is in the environment.

A place persists in some respects and changes in others. In one respect, it cannot be changed at all-in its location relative to other places. A place cannot be displaced like an object. That is, the adjacent order of places cannot be permuted; they cannot be shuffled. The sleeping places, eating places, meeting 230 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

places, hiding places, and falling-off places of the habitat are immobile. Place- learning is therefore different from other kinds.

Attached Objects

I defined an object in Chapter 3 as a substance partially or wholly surrounded by the medium. An object attached to a place is only partly surrounded. It is a protuberance. It cannot be displaced without becoming detached. Nevertheless, it has a surface and enough of a natural boundary to constitute a unit. Attached objects can thus be counted. Animals and children learn what such objects are good for and how to distinguish them. But they cannot be separated from the places where they are found.

Detached Objects

A fully detached object can be displaced or, in some cases, can displace itself. Learning to perceive it thus has a different character from learning to perceive places and attached objects. Its affordances are different. It can be put side by side with another object and compared. It can therefore be grouped or classed by the manipulation of sorting. Such objects when grouped can be rearranged, that is, permuted. And this means not only that they can be counted but that an abstract number can be assigned to the group.

It is probably harder for a child to perceive "same object in a different place" than it is to perceive "same object in the same place." The former requires that the information for persistence-despite-displacement should have been noticed, whereas the latter does not.

Inanimate detached objects, rigid or nonrigid, natural or manufactured, can be said to have features that distinguish them. The features are probably not denumerable, unlike the objects themselves. But if they are compounded to specify affordances, as I argued they must be, only the relevant compounds need to be distinguished. So when it comes to the natural, nonrigid, animate objects of the world whose dimensions of difference are overwhelmingly rich and complex, we pay attention only to what the animal or person affords (Chapter 8).

Persisting Substances

A substance is that of which places and objects are composed. It can be vaporous, liquid, plastic, viscous, or rigid, that is, increasingly "substantial."A substance, together with what it affords, is fairly well specified by the color and texture of its surface. Smoke, milk, clay, bread, and wood are polymorphic in layout but invariant in color-texture. Substances, of course, can be smelled and tasted and palpated as well as seen. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 231

The animal or child who begins to perceive substances, therefore, does so in a different way than one who begins to perceive places, attached objects, and detached objects. Substances are formless and cannot be counted. The number of substances, natural compositions, or mixtures is not fixed. (The number of chemical elements is fixed, but that is a different matter.) We discriminate among surface colors and textures, but we cannot group them as we do detached objects and we cannot order them as we do places.

We also, of course, perceive changes in otherwise persisting substances, the ripening of fruit, and the results of boiling and baking, or of mixing and hardening. But these are a kind of event.

Events

As I used the term, an event is any change of a substance, place, or object, chem- ical, mechanical, or biophysical. The change may be slow or fast, reversible or nonreversible, repeating or nonrepeating. Events include what happens to objects in general, plus what the animate objects make happen. Events are nested within superordinate events. The motion of a detached object is not the proto- type of an event that we have been led to think it was. Events of different sorts are perceived as such and are not, surely, reducible to elementary motions.

The Information for Perception

Information, as the term is used in this book (but not in other books), refers to specification of the observer's environment, not to specification of the observ- er's receptors or sense organs. The qualities of objects are specified by inform- ation; the qualities of the receptors and nerves are specified by sensations. Information about the world cuts right across the qualities of sense.

The term information cannot have its familiar dictionary meaning of know- ledge communicated to a receiver. This is unfortunate, and I would use another term if I could. The only recourse is to ask the reader to remember that picking up information is not to be thought of as a case of communicating. The world does not speak to the observer. Animals and humans communicate with cries, gestures, speech, pictures, writing, and television, but we cannot hope to understand perception in terms of these channels; it is quite the other way around. Words and pictures convey information, carry it, or transmit it, but the information in the sea of energy around each of us, luminous or mechanical or chemical energy, is not conveyed. It is simply there. The assumption that information can be transmitted and the assumption that it can be stored are appropriate for the theory of communication, not for the theory of perception.

The vast area of speculation about the so-called media of communication had a certain discipline imposed on it some years ago by a mathematical theory of communication (Shannon and Weaver, 1949). A useful measure of information 232 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

transmitted was formulated, in terms of "bits."A sender and receiver, a channel, and a finite number of possible signals were assumed. The result was a genuine discipline of communications engineering. But, although psychologists promptly tried to apply it to the senses and neuropsychologists began thinking of nerve impulses in terms of bits and the brain in terms of a computer, the applications did not work. Shannon's concept of information applies to telephone hookups and radio broadcasting in elegant ways but not, I think, to the firsthand percep- tion of being in-the-world, to what the baby gets when first it opens its eyes. The information for perception, unhappily, cannot be defined and measured as Claude Shannon's information can be.

The information in ambient light, along with sound, odor, touches, and natural chemicals, is inexhaustible. A perceiver can keep on noticing facts about the world she lives in to the end of her life without ever reaching a limit. There is no threshold for information comparable to a stimulus threshold. Information is not lost to the environment when gained by the individual; it is not conserved like energy.

Information is not specific to the banks of photoreceptors, mechanore- ceptors, and chemoreceptors that lie within the sense organs. Sensations are specific to receptors and thus, normally, to the kinds of stimulus energy that touch them off. But information is not energy-specific. Stimuli are not always imposed on a passive subject. In life one obtains stimulation in order to extract the information (Gibson, 19666, Ch. 2). The information can be the same, despite a radical change in the stimulation obtained.

Finally, a concept of information is required that admits of the possibility of illusion. Illusions are a theoretical perplexity in any approach to the study of perception. Is information always valid and illusion simply a failure to pick it up? Or is the information picked up sometimes impoverished, masked, ambiguous, equivocal, contradictory, even false? The puzzle is especially critical in vision.

In Chapter 14 of The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966b) and again in this book I have tried to come to terms with the problem of misperception. I am only sure of this: it is not one problem but a complex of different problems. Consider, first, the mirage of palm trees in the desert sky, or the straight stick that looks bent because it is partly immersed in water. These illusions, together with the illusion of Narcissus, arise from the regular reflection or refraction of light, that is, from exceptions to the ecological optics of the scatter-reflecting surface and the perfectly homogeneous medium. Then consider, second, the misperception in the case of the shark under the calm water or the electric shock hidden in the radio cabinet. Failure to perceive the danger is not then blamed on the perceiver. Consider, third, the sheet of glass mistaken for an open doorway or the horizontal sheet of glass (the optical cliff) mistaken for a void. A fourth case is the room composed of trapezoidal surfaces or the trapezoidal window, which look normally rectangular so long as the observer does not open both eyes and walk around. Optical misinformation The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 233 enters into each of these cases in a different way. But in the last analysis, are they explained by misinformation? Or is it a matter of failure to pick up all the avail- able information, the inexhaustible reservoir that lies open to further scrutiny?

The misperceiving of affordances is a serious matter. As I noted in Chapter 8, a wildcat may look like a cat. (But does he look just like a cat?) A malevolent man may act like a benevolent one. (But does he exactly?) The line between the pickup of misinformation and the failure to pick up information is hard to draw.

Consider the human habit of picture-making, which I take to be the devising and displaying of opticalinformation for perception by others. It is thus a means of communication, giving rise to mediated apprehension, but it is more like direct pickup than word-making is. Depiction and its consequences are deferred until later, but it can be pointed out here that picture-makers have been exper- imenting on us for centuries with artificial displays of information in a special form. They enrich or impoverish it, mask or clarify it, ambiguate or disambig- uate it. They often try to produce a discrepancy of information, an equivoca- tion or contradiction, in the same display. Painters invented the cues for depth in the first place, and psychologists looked at their paintings and began to talk about cues. The notions of counterbalanced cues, of figure-ground reversals, of equivocal perspectives, of different perspectives on the same object, of "impos- sible"objects-all these come from artists who were simply experimenting with frozen optical information.

An important fact to be noted about any pictorial display of optical inform- ation is that, in contrast with the inexhaustible reservoir of information in an illuminated medium, it cannot be looked at close up. Information to specify the display as such, the canvas, the surface, the screen, can always be picked up by an observer who walks around and looks closely.

The Concept of a Perceptual System

The theory of information pickup requires perceptual systems, not senses. Some years ago I tried to prove that a perceptual system was radically different from a sense (Gibson, 1966b), the one being active and the other passive. People said, "Well, what I mean by a sense is an active sense."But it turned out that they still meant the passive inputs of a sensory nerve, the activity being what occurs in the brain when the inputs get there. That was not what I meant by a percep- tual system. I meant the activities of looking, listening, touching, tasting, or sniffing. People then said, "Well, but those are responses to sights, sounds, touches, tastes, or smells, that is, motor acts resulting from sensory inputs. What you call a perceptual system is nothing but a case of feedback." I was discour- aged. People did not understand.

I shall here make another attempt to show that the senses considered as special senses cannot be reconciled with the senses considered as perceptual systems. The five perceptual systems correspond to five modes of overt attention. They 234 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

have overlapping functions, and they are all more or less subordinated to an overall orienting system. A system has organs, whereas a sense has receptors. A system can orient, explore, investigate, adjust, optimize, resonate, extract, and come to an equilibrium, whereas a sense cannot. The characteristic activities of the visual system have been described in Chapter 12 of this book. The charac- teristic activities of the auditory system, the haptic system, and the two related parts of what I called the "chemical value system"were described in Chapters 5-8 of my earlier book (Gibson, 1966b). Five fundamental differences between a sense and a perceptual system are given below.

1. A special sense is defined by a bank of receptors or receptive units that are connected with a so-called projection center in the brain. Local stimuli at the sensory surface will cause local firing of neurons in the center. The adjust- ments of the organ in which the receptors are incorporated are not included within the definition of a sense.

A perceptual system is defined by an organ and its adjustments at a given level of functioning, subordinate or superordinate. At any level, the incoming and outgoing nerve fibers are considered together so as to make a continuous loop.

The organs of the visual system, for example, from lower to higher are roughly as follows. First, the lens, pupil, chamber, and retina comprise an organ. Second, the eye with its muscles in the orbit comprise an organ that is both stabilized and mobile. Third, the two eyes in the head comprise a binocular organ. Fourth, the eyes in a mobile head that can turn comprise an organ for the pickup of ambient information. Fifth, the eyes in a head on a body constitute a superordinate organ for information pickup over paths of locomotion. The adjustments of accommodation, intensity modulation, and dark adaptation go with the first level. The movements of compensation, fixation, and scanning go with the second level. The movements of vergence and the pickup of disparity go with the third level. The movements of the head, and of the body as a whole. go with the fourth and fifth levels. All of them serve the pickup of information.

2. In the case of a special sense, the receptors can only receive stimuli, pass- ively, whereas in the case of a perceptual system the input-output loop can be supposed to obtain information, actively. Even when the theory of the special senses is liberalized by the modern hypothesis of receptive units, the latter are supposed to be triggered by complex stimuli or modulated in some passive fashion.

3. The inputs of a special sense constitute a repertory of innate sensations, whereas the achievements of a perceptual system are susceptible to maturation and learning. Sensations of one modality can be combined with those of another in accordance with the laws of association: they can be organized or fused or supplemented or selected, but no new sensations can be learned. The information that is picked up, on the other hand, becomes more and more subtle, elaborate, and precise with practice. One can keep on learning to perceive as long as life goes on. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 235

4. The inputs of the special senses have the qualities of the receptors being stimulated, whereas the achievements of the perceptual systems are specific to the qualities of things in the world, especially their affordances. The recogni- tion of this limitation of the senses was forced upon us by Johannes Müller with his doctrine of specific "nerve energies."He understood clearly, if reluctantly, the implication that, because we can never know the external causes of our sensations, we cannot know the outer world. Strenuous efforts have to be made if one is to avoid this shocking conclusion. Helmholtz argued that we must deduce the causes of our sensations because we cannot detect them. The hypo- thesis that sensations provide clues or cues for perception of the world is similar. The popular formula that we can interpret sensory signals is a variant of it. But it seems to me that all such arguments come down to this: we can perceive the world only if we already know what there is to be perceived. And that, of course, is circular. I shall come back to this point again.

The alternative is to assume that sensations triggered by light, sound, pres- sure, and chemicals are merely incidental, that information is available to a perceptual system, and that the qualities of the world in relation to the needs of the observer are experienced directly.

5. In the case of a special sense the process of attention occurs at centers within the nervous system, whereas in the case of a perceptual system attention pervades the whole input-output loop. In the first case attention is a conscious- ness that can be focused; in the second case it is a skill that can be educated. In the first case physiological metaphors are used, such as the filtering of nervous impulses or the switching of impulses from one path to another. In the second case the metaphors used can be terms such as resonating, extracting, optimizing, or symmetricalizing and such acts as orienting, exploring, investigating, or adjusting.

I suggested in Chapter 12 that a normal act of visual attention consists of scanning a whole feature of the ambient array, not of fixating a single detail of the array. We are tempted to think of attention as strictly a narrowing-down and holding-still, but actually this is rare. The invariants of structure in an optic array that constitute information are more likely to be gradients than small details, and they are scanned over wide angles.

The Registering of Both Persistence and Change

The theory of information pickup requires that the visual system be able to detect both persistence and change-the persistence of places, objects, and substances along with whatever changes they undergo. Everything in the world persists in some respects and changes in some respects. So also does the observer himself. And some things persist for long intervals, others for short.

The perceiving of persistence and change (instead of color, form, space, time, and motion) can be stated in various ways. We can say that the perceiver separates the change from the nonchange, notices what stays the same and what 236 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

does not, or sees the continuing identity of things along with the events in which they participate. The question, of course, is how he does so. What is the information for persistence and change? The answer must be of this sort: The perceiver extracts the invariants of structure from the flux of stimulation while still noticing the flux. For the visual system in particular, he tunes in on the invariant structure of the ambient optic array that underlies the changing perspective structure caused by his movements.

The hypothesis that invariance under optical transformation constitutes information for the perception of a rigid persisting object goes back to the moving- shadow experiment (Gibson and Gibson, 1957). The outcome of that experiment was paradoxical; it seemed at the time that a changing form elicited the perception of a constant form with a changing slant. The solution was to postulate invariants of optical structure for the persisting object, "formless"invariants, and a particular disturbance of optical structure for the motion of the object, a perspective trans- formation. Separate terms needed to be devised for physical motions and for the optical motions that specified them, for events in the world and for events in the array, for geometry did not provide the terms. Similarly, different terms need to be invented to describe invariants of the changing world and invariants of the changing array; the geometrical word form will not do. Perhaps the best policy is to use the terms persistence and change to refer to the environment but preservation and disturbance of structure to refer to the optic array.

The stimulus-sequence theory of perception, based on a succession of discrete eye fixations, can assume only that the way to apprehend persistence is by an act of comparison and judgment. The perception of what-it-is-now is compared with the memory of what-it-was-then, and they are judged same. The continuous pickup theory of perception can assume that the apprehension of persistence is a simple act of invariance detection. Similarly, the snapshot theory must assume that the way to apprehend change is to compare what-it- is-now with what-it-was-then and judge different, whereas the pickup theory can assume an awareness of transformation. The congruence of the array with itself or the disparity of the array with itself, as the case may be, is picked up.

The perception of the persisting identity of things is fundamental to other kinds of perception. Consider an example, the persisting identity of another person. How does a child come to apprehend the identity of the mother? You might say that when the mother-figure, or the face, is continually fixated by the child the persistence of the sensation is supported by the continuing stimulus. So it is when the child clings to the mother. But what if the mother-figure is scanned? What if the figure leaves and returns to the field of view? What if the figure goes away and comes back? What is perceived when it emerges from the distance or from darkness, when its back is turned, when its clothing is changed, when its emotional state is altered, when it comes back into sight after a long interval? In short, how is it that the phenomenal identity of a person agrees so well with the biological identity, despite all the vicissitudes of the figure in the optic array and all the events in which the person participates? The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 237

The same questions can be asked about inanimate objects, attached objects, places, and substances. The features of a person are invariant to a considerable degree (the eyes, nose, mouth, style of gesture, and voice). But so are the analogous features of other things, the child's blanket, the kitchen stove, the bedroom, and the bread on the table. All have to be identified as continuing, as persisting, as maintaining existence. And this is not explained by the constructing of a concept for each.

We are accustomed to assuming that successive stimuli from the same entity, sensory encounters with it, are united by an act of recognition. We have assumed that perception ceases and memory takes over when sensation stops. Hence, every fresh glimpse of anything requires the act of linking it up with the memories of that thing instead of some other thing. The judgment, "I have seen this before," is required for the apprehension of "same thing,"even when the observer has only turned away, or has only glanced away for an instant. The classical theory of sense perception is reduced to an absurdity by this require- ment. The alternative is to accept the theory of invariance detection.

THE EFFECT OF PERSISTING STIMULATION

ON PERCEPTION

We have assumed that perception stops when sensation stops and that

sensation stops when stimulation stops, or very soon thereafter. Hence, a

persisting stimulus is required for the perception of a persisting object. The

fact is, however, that a truly persisting stimulus on the retina or the skin

specifies only that the observer does not or cannot move his eye or his limb,

and the sense perception soon fades out by sensory adaptation (Chapter 4).

The persistence of an object is specified by invariants of structure, not by the

persistence of stimulation.

The seeing of persistence considered as the picking up of invariants under

change resolves an old puzzle: the phenomenal identity of the spots of a

retinal pattern when the image is transposed over the retina stroboscopically.

The experiments of Josef Ternus first made this puzzle evident. See Gibson

(1950, pp. 56 ff.) for a discussion and references.

I used to think that the aftereffects of persisting stimulation of the retina

obtained by the prolonged fixation of a display could be very revealing.

Besides ordinary afterimages there are all sorts of perceptual aftereffects, some

of which I discovered. But I no longer believe that experiments on so-called

perceptual adaptation are revealing, and I have given up theorizing about

them. The aftereffects of prolonged scrutiny are of many sorts. Until we know

more about information pickup, this field of investigation will be incoherent. 238 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The quality of familiarity that can go with the perception of a place, object, or person, as distinguished from the quality of unfamiliarity, is a fact of experi- ence. But is familiarity a result of the percept making contact with the traces of past percepts of the same thing? Is unfamiliarity a result of not making such contact? I think not. There is a circularity in the reasoning, and it is a bad theory. The quality of familiarity simply accompanies the perception of persistence.

The perception of the persisting identity of places and objects is more funda- mental than the perception of the differences among them. We are told that to perceive something is to categorize it, to distinguish it from the other types of things that it might have been. The essence of perceiving is discriminating. Things differ among themselves, along dimensions of difference. But this leaves out of account the simple fact that the substance, place, object, person, or what- ever has to last long enough to be distinguished from other substances, places, objects, or persons. The detecting of the invariant features of a persisting thing should not be confused with the detecting of the invariant features that make different things similar. Invariants over time and invariants over entities are not grasped in the same way.

In the case of the persisting thing, I suggest, the perceptual system simply extracts the invariants from the flowing array; it resonates to the invariant struc- ture or is attuned to it. In the case of substantially distinct things, I venture, the perceptual system must abstract the invariants. The former process seems to be simpler than the latter, more nearly automatic. The latter process has been interpreted to imply an intellectual act of lifting out something that is mental from a collection of objects that are physical, of forming an abstract concept from concrete percepts, but that is very dubious. Abstraction is invariance detection across objects. But the invariant is only a similarity, not a persistence. Summary of the Theory of Pickup

According to the theory being proposed, perceiving is a registering of certain definite dimensions of invariance in the stimulus flux together with definite parameters of disturbance. The invariants are invariants of structure, and the disturbances are disturbances of structure. The structure, for vision, is that of the ambient optic array.

The invariants specify the persistence of the environment and of oneself. The disturbances specify the changes in the environment and of oneself. A perceiver is aware of her existence in a persisting environment and is also aware of her movements relative to the environment, along with the motions of objects and nonrigid surfaces relative to the environment. The term awareness is used to imply a direct pickup of the information, not necessarily to imply consciousness.

There are many dimensions of invariance in an ambient optic array over time, that is, for paths of observation. One invariant, for example, is caused by The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 239 the occluding edge of the nose, and it specifies the self. Another is the gradient of optical texture caused by the material texture of the substratum, and it spec- ifies the basic environment. Equally, there are many parameters of disturbance of an ambient optic array. One, for example, is caused by the sweeping of the nose over the ambient optic array, and it specifies head turning. Another is the deletion and accretion of texture at the edges of a form in the array, and it specifies the motion of an object over the ground.

For different kinds of events in the world there are different parameters of optical disturbance, not only accretion-deletion but also polar outflow-inflow, compression, transformation, substitution, and others. Hence, the same object can be seen undergoing different events, and different objects can be seen undergoing the same event. For example, an apple may ripen, fall, collide, roll, or be eaten, and eating may happen to an apple, carrot, egg, biscuit, or lamb chop. If the parameter of optical disturbance is distinguished, the event will be perceived. Note how radically different this is from saying that if stimulus- event A is invariably followed by stimulus-event B we will come to expect B whenever we experience A. The latter is classical association theory (or condi- tioning theory, or expectancy theory). It rests on the stimulus-sequence doctrine. It implies that falling, colliding, rolling, or eating are not units but sequences. It implies, with David Hume, that even if B has followed Aa thou- sand times there is no certainty that it will follow A in the future. An event is only known by a conjunction of atomic sensations, a contingency. If this recur- rent sequence is experienced again and again, the observer will begin to anti- cipate, or have faith, or learn by induction, but that is the best he can do.

The process of pickup is postulated to depend on the input-output loop of a perceptual system. For this reason, the information that is picked up cannot be the familiar kind that is transmitted from one person to another and that can be stored. According to pickup theory, information does not have to be stored in memory because it is always available.

The process of pickup is postulated to be very susceptible to development and learning. The opportunities for educating attention, for exploring and adjusting, for extracting and abstracting are unlimited. The increasing capacity of a perceptual system to pick up information, however, does not in itself constitute information. The ability to perceive does not imply, necessarily, the having of an idea of what can be perceived. The having of ideas is a fact, but it is not a prerequisite of perceiving. Perhaps it is a kind of extended perceiving. The Traditional Theories of Perception: Input Processing

The theory of information pickup purports to be an alternative to the tradi- tional theories of perception. It differs from all of them, I venture to suggest, in rejecting the assumption that perception is the processing of inputs. Inputs mean sensory or afferent nerve impulses to the brain. 240 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Adherents to the traditional theories of perception have recently been making the claim that what they assume is the processing of information in a modern sense of the term, not sensations, and that therefore they are not bound by the traditional theories of perception. But it seems to me that all they are doing is climbing on the latest bandwagon, the computer bandwagon, without reappraising the traditional assumption that perceiving is the processing of inputs. I refuse to let them pre-empt the term information. As I use the term, it is not something that has to be processed. The inputs of the receptors have to be processed, of course, because they in themselves do not specify anything more than the anatomical units that are triggered.

All kinds of metaphors have been suggested to describe the ways in which sensory inputs are processed to yield perceptions. It is supposed that sensation occurs first, perception occurs next, and knowledge occurs last, a progression from the lower to the higher mental processes. One process is the filtering of sensory inputs. Another is the organizing of sensory inputs, the grouping of elements into a spatial pattern. The integrating of elements into a temporal pattern may or may not be included in the organizing process. After that, the processes become highly speculative. Some theorists propose mental opera- tions. Others argue for semilogical processes or problem-solving. Many theor- ists are in favor of a process analogous to the decoding of signals. All theorists seem to agree that past experience is brought to bear on the sensory inputs, which means that memories are somehow applied to them. Apart from filtering and organizing, the processes suggested are cognitive. Consider some of them. Mental Operations on the Sensory Inputs

The a priori categories of understanding possessed by the perceived, according to Kant

The perceiver's presuppositions about what is being perceived

Innate ideas about the world

Semilogical Operations on the Sensory Inputs

Unconscious inferences about the outer causes of the sensory inputs, according to Helmholtz (the outer world is deduced)

Estimates of the probable character of the "distant"objects based on the proximal"stimuli, according to Egon Brunswik (1956), said to be a quasira- tional, not a fully rational, process

Decoding Operations on the Sensory Inputs

The interpreting of the inputs considered as signals (a very popular analogy with many variants) The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 241 The decoding of sensory messages

The utilizing of sensory cues

The understanding of signs, or indicators, or even clues, in the manner of a police detective

The Application of Memories to the Sensory Inputs

The"accrual"of a context of memory images and feelings to the core of sensa- tions, according to E. B. Titchener's theory of perception (1924).

This last hypothetical process is perhaps the most widely accepted of all, and the most elaborated. Perceptual learning is supposed to be a matter of enriching the input, not of differentiating the information (Gibson and Gibson, 1955). But the process of combining memories with inputs turns out to be not at all simple when analyzed. The appropriate memories have to be retrieved from storage, that is, aroused or summoned; an image does not simply accrue. The sensory input must fuse in some fashion with the stored images; or the sensory input is assimilated to a composite memory image, or, if this will not do, it is said to be assimilated to a class, a type, a schema, or a concept. Each new sensory input must be categorized- assigned to its class, matched to its type, fitted to its schema, and so on. Note that categories cannot become established until enough items have been classified but that items cannot be classified until categories have been established. It is this diffi- culty, for one, that compels some theorists to suppose that classification is a priori and that people and animals have innate or instinctive knowledge of the world.

The error lies, it seems to me, in assuming that either innate ideas or acquired ideas must be applied to bare sensory inputs for perceiving to occur. The fallacy is to assume that because inputs convey no knowledge they can somehow be made to yield knowledge by "processing"them. Knowledge of the world must come from somewhere; the debate is over whether it comes from stored know- ledge, from innate knowledge, or from reason. But all three doctrines beg the question. Knowledge of the world cannot be explained by supposing that knowledge of the world already exists. All forms of cognitive processing imply cognition so as to account for cognition.

All this should be treated as ancient history. Knowledge of the environment, surely, develops as perception develops, extends as the observers travel, gets finer as they learn to scrutinize, gets longer as they apprehend more events, gets fuller as they see more objects, and gets richer as they notice more affordances. Knowledge of this sort does not "come from" anywhere; it is got by looking, along with listening, feeling, smelling, and tasting. The child also, of course, begins to acquire knowledge that comes from parents, teachers, pictures, and books. But this is a different kind of knowledge.

The False Dichotomy between Present and Past Experience

The division between present experience and past experience may seem to be self-evident. How could anyone deny it? Yet it is denied in supposing that we can experience both change and nonchange. The difference between present and past blurs, and the clarity of the distinction slips away. The stream of exper- ience does not consist of an instantaneous present and a linear past receding into the distance; it is not a "traveling razor's edge" dividing the past from the future. Perhaps the present has a certain duration. If so, it should be possible to find out when perceiving stops and remembering begins. But it has not been possible. There are attempts to talk about a "conscious"present, or a "specious"present, or a "span" of present perception, or a span of "immediate memory," but they all founder on the simple fact that there is no dividing line between the present and the past, between perceiving and remembering. A special sense impression clearly ceases when the sensory excitation ends, but a perception does not. It does not become a memory after a certain length of time. A perception, in fact. does not have an end. Perceiving goes on.

Perhaps the force of the dichotomy between present and past experience comes from language, where we are not allowed to say anything intermediate between "I see you" and "I saw you" or "I am seeing you"and "I was seeing you." Verbs can take the present tense or the past tense. We have no words to describe my continuing awareness of you, whether you are in sight or out of sight. Language is categorical. Because we are led to separate the present from the past, we find ourselves involved in what I have called the "muddle of memory" (Gibson, 1966a). We think that the past ceases to exist unless it is"preserved"in memory. We assume that memory is the bridge between the past and the present. We assume that memories accumulate and are stored somewhere; that they are images, or pictures, or representations of the past; or that memory is actually physiological, not mental, consisting of engrams or traces; or that it actually consists of neural connections. not engrams: that memory is the basis of all learning; that memory is the basis of habit; that memories live on in the uncon- scious: that heredity is a form of memory: that cultural heredity is another form of memory; that any effect of the past on the present is memory, including hyster- esis. If we cannot do any better than this, we should stop using the word. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 243

The traditional theories of perception take it for granted that what we see now, present experience, is the sensory basis of our perception of the environment and that what we have seen up to now, past experience, is added to it. We can only understand the present in terms of the past. But what we see now (when it is carefully analyzed) turns out to be at most a peculiar set of surfaces that happen to come within the field of view and face the point of observation (Chapter 11). It does not comprise what we see. It could not possibly be the basis of our perception of the environment. What we see now refers to the self, not the environment. The perspective appearance of the world at a given moment of time is simply what specifies to the observer where he is at that moment. The perceptual process does not begin with this peculiar projection, this momentary pattern. The perceiving of the world begins with the pickup of invariants.

Evidently the theory of information pickup does not need memory. It does not have to have as a basic postulate the effect of past experience on present experience by way of memory. It needs to explain learning, that is, the improve- ment of perceiving with practice and the education of attention, but not by an appeal to the catch-all of past experience or to the muddle of memory.

The state of a perceptual system is altered when it is attuned to information of a certain sort. The system has become sensitized. Differences are noticed that were previously not noticed. Features become distinctive that were formerly vague. But this altered state need not be thought of as depending on a memory, an image, an engram, or a trace. An image of the past, if experienced at all, would be only an incidental symptom of the altered state.

This is not to deny that reminiscence, expectation, imagination, fantasy, and dreaming actually occur. It is only to deny that they have an essential role to play in perceiving. They are kinds of visual awareness other than perceptual. Let us now consider them in their own right.

A New Approach to Nonperceptual Awareness

The redefinition of perception implies a redefinition of the so-called higher mental processes. In the old mentalistic psychology, they stood above the lower mental processes, the sensory and reflex processes, which could be understood in terms of the physiology of receptors and nerves. These higher processes were vaguely supposed to be intellectual processes, inasmuch as the intellect was contrasted with the senses. They occurred in the brain. They were operations of the mind. No list of them was ever agreed upon, but remembering, thinking, conceiving, infer- ring, judging, expecting, and, above all, knowing were the words used. Imagining, dreaming, rationalizing, and wishful thinking were also recognized, but it was not clear that they were higher processes in the intellectual sense. I am convinced that none of them can ever be understood as an operation of the mind. They will never be understood as reactions of the body, either. But perhaps if they are 244 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

reconsidered in relation to ecological perceiving they will begin to sort them- selves out in a new and reasonable way that fits with the evidence.

To perceive is to be aware of the surfaces of the environment and of oneself in it. The interchange between hidden and unhidden surfaces is essential to this awareness. These are existing surfaces; they are specified at some points of observation. Perceiving gets wider and finer and longer and richer and fuller as the observer explores the environment. The full awareness of surfaces includes their layout, their substances, their events, and their affordances. Note how this definition includes within perception a part of memory, expectation, know- ledge, and meaning-some part but not all of those mental processes in each case.

One kind of remembering, then, would be an awareness of surfaces that have ceased to exist or events that will not recur, such as items in the story of one's own life. There is no point of observation at which such an item will come into sight.

To expect, anticipate, plan, or imagine creatively is to be aware of surfaces that do not exist or events that do not occur but that could arise or be fabricated within what we call the limits of possibility.

To daydream, dream, or imagine wishfully (or fearfully) is to be aware of surfaces or events that do not exist or occur and that are outside the limits of possibility.

These three kinds of nonperceptual awareness are not explained, I think, by the traditional hypothesis of mental imagery. They are better explained by some such hypothesis as this: a perceptual system that has become sensitized to certain invariants and can extract them from the stimulus flux can also operate without the constraints of the stimulus flux. Information becomes further detached from stimulation. The adjustment loops for looking around, looking at, scanning, and focusing are then inoperative. The visual system visualizes. But this is still an activity of the system, not an appearance in the theater of consciousness.

Besides these, other kinds of cognitive awareness occur that are not strictly perceptual. Before considering them, however, I must clarify what I mean by imaginary or unreal.

The Relationship between Imagining and Perceiving

I assume that a normal observer is well aware of the difference between surfaces that exist and surfaces that do not. (Those that do not have ceased to exist, or have not begun to, or have not and will not. How can this be so? What is the information for existence? What are the criteria? It is widely believed that young children are not aware of the differences, and neither are adults suffering from hallucinations. They do not distinguish between what is "real"and what is "imaginary" because perception and mental imagery cannot be separated. This doctrine rests on the assumption that, because a percept and an image both The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 245 occur in the brain, the one can pass over into the other by gradual steps. The only "tests for reality"are intellectual. A percept cannot validate itself.

We have been told ever since John Locke that an image is a"faint copy"of a percept. We are told by Titchener(1924) that an image is "easily confused with a sensation"(p. 198). His devoted student, C. W. Perky, managed to show that a faint optical picture secretly projected from behind on a translucent screen is sometimes not identified as such when an observer is imagining an object of the same sort on the screen(Perky, 1910). We are told by a famous neurosurgeon that electrical stimulation of the surface of the brain in a conscious patient "has the force" of an actual perception (Penfield, 1958). It is said that when a feeling of reality accompanies a content of consciousness it is marked as a percept and when it does not it is marked as an image. All these assertions are extremely dubious

I suggest that perfectly reliable and automatic tests for reality are involved in the working of a perceptual system. They do not have to be intellectual. A surface is seen with more or less definition as the accommodation of the lens changes; an image is not. A surface becomes clearer when fixated: an image does not. A surface can be scanned; an image cannot. When the eyes converge on an object in the world, the sensation of crossed diplopia disappears, and when the eyes diverge, the "double image"reappears; this does not happen for an image in the space of the mind. An object can be scrutinized with the whole repertory of optimizing adjustments described in Chapter 11. No image can be scrutinized- not an afterimage, not a so-called eidetic image, not the image in a dream, and not even a hallucination. An imaginary object can undergo an imaginary scrutiny, no doubt, but you are not going to discover a new and surprising feature of the object this way. For it is the very features of the object that your perceptual system has already picked up that constitute your ability to visualize it. The most decisive test for reality is whether you can discover new features and details by the act of scrutiny. Can you obtain new stimulation and extract new information from it? Is the information inexhaustible? Is there more to be seen? The imaginary scrutiny of an imaginary entity cannot pass this test.

A related criterion for the existence of a thing is reversible occlusion. Whatever goes out of sight as you move your head and comes into sight as you move back is a persisting surface. Whatever comes into sight when you move your head is a preexisting surface. That is to say, it exists. The present, past, or future tense of the verb see is irrelevant: the fact is perceived without words. Hence, a criterion for real versus imaginary is what happens when you turn and move. When the infant turns her head and creeps about and brings her hands in and out of her field of view, she perceives what is real. The assumption that children cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is imaginary until the intellect develops is mentalistic nonsense. As the child grows up, she apprehends more reality as she visits more places of her habitat.

Nevertheless, it is argued that dreams sometimes have the "feeling" of reality, that some drugs can induce hallucinations, and that a true hallucination in 246 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

psychosis is proof that a mental image can be the same as a percept, for the patient acts as ifhe were perceiving and thinks he is perceiving. I remain dubious (Gibson, 1970). The dreamer is asleep and cannot make the ordinary tests for reality. The drug-taker is hoping for a vision and does not want to make tests for reality. There are many possible reasons why the hallucinating patient does not scrutinize what he says he sees, does not walk around it or take another look at it or test it.

There is a popular fallacy to the effect that if you can touch what you see it is real. The sense of touch is supposed to be more trustworthy than the sense of sight, and Bishop Berkeley's theory of vision was based on this idea. But it is surely wrong. Tactual hallucinations can occur as well as visual. And if the senses are actually perceptual systems, the haptic system as I described it (Gibson, 1966b) has its own exploratory adjustments and its own automatic tests for reality. One perceptual system does not validate another. Seeing and touching are two ways of getting much the same information about the world. A New Approach to Knowing

The theory of information pickup makes a clear-cut separation between perception and fantasy, but it closes the supposed gap between perception and knowledge. The extracting and abstracting of invariants are what happens in both perceiving and knowing. To perceive the environment and to conceive it are different in degree but not in kind. One is continuous with the other. Our reasons for supposing that seeing something is quite unlike knowing something come from the old doctrine that seeing is having temporary sensations one after another at the passing moment of present time, whereas knowing is having permanent concepts stored in memory. It should now be clear that perceptual seeing is an awareness of persisting structure.

Knowing is an extension of perceiving. The child becomes aware of the world by looking around and looking at, by listening, feeling, smelling, and tasting, but then she begins to be made aware of the world as well. She is shown things, and told things, and given models and pictures of things, and then instruments and tools and books, and finally rules and short cuts for finding out more things. Toys, pictures, and words are aids to perceiving, provided by parents and teachers. They transmit to the next generation the tricks of the human trade. The labors of the first perceivers are spared their descendants. The extracting and abstracting of the invariants that specify the environment are made vastly easier with these aids to comprehension. But they are not in themselves knowledge, as we are tempted to think. All they can do is facilitate knowing by the young.

These extended or aided modes of apprehension are all cases of information pickup from a stimulus flux. The learner has to hear the speech in order to pick up the message; to see the model, the picture, or the writing; to manipulate the instrument in order to extract the information. But the information itself is largely independent of the stimulus flux. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 247

What are the kinds of culturally transmitted knowledge? I am uncertain, for they have not been considered at this level of description. Present-day discussions of the "media of communication" seem to me glib and superficial. I suspect that there are many kinds merging into one another, of great complexity. But I can think of three obvious ways to facilitate knowing, to aid perceiving, or to extend the limits of comprehension: the use of instruments, the use of verbal descriptions, and the use of pictures. Words and pictures work in a different way than do instruments, for the information is obtained at second hand. Consider them separately.

Knowing Mediated by Instruments

Surfaces and events that are too small or too far away cannot be perceived. You can of course increase the visual solid angle if you approach the item and put your eye close to it, but that procedure has its limits. You cannot approach the moon by walking, and you cannot get your eye close enough to a drop of pond water to see the little animals swimming in it. What can be done is to enlarge the visual solid angle from the moon or the water drop. You can convert a tiny sample of the ambient optic array at a point of observation into a magnified sample by means of a telescope or a microscope. The structure of the sample is only a little distorted. The surfaces perceived when the eye is placed at the eyepiece are "virtual" instead of "real," but only in the special sense that they are very much closer to the observer. The invariants of structure are nearly the same when a visual angle with its nested components is magnified. This descrip- tion of magnification comes from ecological optics. For designing the lens system of the instrument, a different optics is needed.

The discovery of these instruments in the seventeenth century enabled men to know much more about very large bodies and very small bodies than they had before. But this new knowledge was almost like seeing. The mountains of the moon and the motions of a living cell could be observed with adjustments of the instrument not unlike those of the head and eyes. The guarantees of reality were similar. You did not have to take another person's word for what he had seen. You might have to learn to use the instrument, but you did not have to learn to interpret the information. Nor did you have to judge whether or not the other person was telling the truth. With a telescope or a microscope you could look for yourself.

THE UNAIDED PERCEIVING OF OBJECTS IN THE SKY

Objects in the sky are very different from objects on the ground. The heav-

enly bodies do not come to rest on the ground as ordinary objects do. The 248 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

rainbow and the clouds are transient, forming and dissipating like mists on

earth. But the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars seem permanent,

appearing to revolve around the stationary earth in perfect cycles and

continuing to exist while out of sight. They are immortal and mysterious.

They cannot be scrutinized.

Optical information for direct perception of these bodies with the unaided

eye is lacking. Their size and distance are indeterminate except that they rise

and set from behind the distant horizon and are thus very far away. Their

motions are very different from those of ordinary objects. The character of

their surfaces is indefinite, and of what substances they are composed is not

clear. The sun is fiery by day, and the others are fiery at night, unlike the

textured reflecting surfaces of most terrestrial objects. What they afford is not

visible to the eye. Lights in the sky used to look like gods. Nowadays they

look like flying saucers.

All sorts of instruments have been devised for mediating apprehension. Some optical instruments merely enhance the information that vision is ready to pick up; others-a spectroscope, for example-require some inference; still others, like the Wilson cloud chamber, demand a complex chain of inferences.

Some measuring instruments are closer to perception than others. The measuring stick for counting units of distance, the gravity balance for counting units of mass, and the hourglass for time are easy to understand. But the complex magnitudes of physical science are another matter. The voltmeters, accelero- meters, and photometers are hard to understand. The child can see the pointer and the scale well enough but has to learn to "read" the instrument, as we say. The direct perception of a distance is in terms of whether one can jump it. The direct perception of a mass is in terms of whether one can lift it. Indirect know- ledge of the metric dimensions of the world is a far extreme from direct percep- tion of the affordance dimensions of the environment. Nevertheless, they are both cut from the same cloth.

Knowing Mediated by Descriptions: Explicit Knowledge

The principal way in which we save our children the trouble of finding out everything for themselves is by describing things for them. We transmit inform- ation and convey knowledge. Wisdom is handed down. Parents and teachers and books give the children knowledge of the world at second hand. Instead of having to be extracted by the child from the stimulus flux, this knowledge is communicated to the child.

It is surely true that speech and language convey information of a certain sort from person to person and from parent to child. Written language can even be stored so that it accumulates in libraries. But we should never forget that this The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 249 is information that has been put into words. It is not the limitless information available in a flowing stimulus array.

Knowledge that has been put into words can be said to be explicit instead of tacit. The human observer can verbalize his awareness, and the result is to make it communicable. But my hypothesis is that there has to be an awareness of the world before it can be put into words. You have to see it before you can say it. Perceiving precedes predicating.

In the course of development the young child first hears talk about what she is perceiving. Then she begins herself to talk about what she perceives. Then she begins to talk to herself about what she knows--when she is alone in her crib, for example. And, finally, her verbal system probably begins to verbalize silently, in much the same way that the visual system begins to visualize, without the constraints of stimulation or muscular action but within the limits of the invari- ants to which the system is attuned. But no matter how much the child puts knowledge into words all of it cannot be put into words. However skilled an explicator one may become one will always, I believe, see more than one can say.

Consider an adult, a philosopher, for example, who sees the cat on the mat. He knows that the cat is on the mat and believes the proposition and can say it, but all the time he plainly sees all sorts of wordless facts-the mat extending without interruption behind the cat, the far side of the cat, the cat hiding part of the mat, the edges of the cat, the cat being supported by the mat, or resting on it, the horizontal rigidity of the floor under the mat, and so on. The so-called concepts of extension, of far and near, gravity, rigidity, horizontal, and so on, are nothing but partial abstractions from a rich but unitary perception of cat- on-mat. The parts of it he can name are called concepts, but they are not all of what he can see.

Fact and Fiction in Words and Pictures

Information about the environment that has been put into words has this disad- vantage: The reality testing that accompanies the pickup of naturalinformation is missing. Descriptions, spoken or written, do not permit the flowing stimulus array to be scrutinized. The invariants have already been extracted. You have to trust the original perceiver; you must "take his word for it,"as we say. What he presents may be fact, or it may be fiction. The same is true of a depiction as of a description.

The child, as I argued above, has no difficulty in contrasting real and imaginary, and the two do not merge. But the factual and the fictional may do so. In storytelling, adults do not always distinguish between true stories and fairy stories. The child herself does not always separate the giving of an account from the telling of a story. Tigers and dragons are both fascinating beasts, and the child will not learn the difference until she perceives that the zoo contains the former but not the latter. 250 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Fictions are not necessarily fantasies. They do not automatically lead one astray, as hallucinations do. They can promote creative plans. They can permit vicarious learning when the child identifies with a fictional character who solves problems and makes errors. The "comic"characters of childhood, the funny and the foolish, the strong and the weak, the clever and the stupid, occupy a great part of children's cognitive awareness, but this does not interfere in the least with their realism when it comes to perceiving.

The difference between the real and the imaginary is specified by two different modes of operation of a perceptual system. But the difference between the factual and the fictional depends on the social system of communication and brings in complicated questions. Verbal descriptions can be true or false as predications. Visual depictions can be correct or incorrect in a wholly different way. A picture cannot be true in the sense that a proposition is true, but it may or may not be true to life.

Knowing and Imagining Mediated by Pictures

Perceiving, knowing, recalling, expecting, and imagining can all be induced by pictures, perhaps even more readily than by words. Picture-making and picture- perceiving have been going on for twenty or thirty thousand years of human life, and this achievement, like language, is ours alone. The image makers can arouse in us an awareness of what they have seen, of what they have noticed, of what they recall, expect, or imagine, and they do so without converting the inform- ation into a different mode. The description puts the optical invariants into words. The depiction, however, captures and displays them in an optic array,where they are more or less the same as they would be in the case of direct perception. So I will argue, at least. The justification of this theory is obviously not a simple matter, and it is deferred to the last chapters of this book, Part IV.

The reality-testing that accompanies unmediated perceiving and that is partly retained in perceiving with instruments is obviously lost in the kind of perceiving that is mediated by pictures. Nevertheless, pictures give us a kind of grasp on the rich complexities of the natural environment that words could never do. Pictures do not stereotype our experience in the same way and to the same degree. We can learn from pictures with less effort than it takes to learn from words. It is not like perceiving at first hand, but it is more like perceiving than any verbal description can be.

The child who has learned to talk about things and events can, metaphoric- ally, talk to himself silently about things and events, so it is supposed. He is said to have "internalized"his speech, whatever that might mean. By analogy with this theory, a child who has learned to draw might be supposed to picture to himself things and events without movement of his hands, to have "internal- ized"his picturemaking. A theory of internal language and internal images might be based on this theory. But it seems to me very dubious. Whether or not The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 251 it is plausible is best decided after we have considered picturemaking in its own right.

Summary

When vision is thought of as a perceptual system instead of as a channel for inputs to the brain, a new theory of perception considered as information pickup becomes possible. Information is conceived as available in the ambient energy flux, not as signals in a bundle of nerve fibers. It is information about both the persisting and the changing features of the environment together. Moreover, information about the observer and his movements is available, so that self-awareness accompanies perceptual awareness.

The qualities of visual experience that are specific to the receptors stimu- lated are not relevant to information pickup but incidental to it. Excitation and transmission are facts of physiology at the cellular level.

The process of pickup involves not only overt movements that can be meas- ured, such as orienting, exploring, and adjusting, but also more general activ- ities, such as optimizing, resonating, and extracting invariants, that cannot so easily be measured.

The ecological theory of direct perception cannot stand by itself. It implies a new theory of cognition in general. In turn, that implies a new theory of noncog- nitive kinds of awareness-fictions, fantasies, dreams, and hallucinations.

Perceiving is the simplest and best kind of knowing. But there are other kinds, of which three were suggested. Knowing by means of instruments extends perceiving into the realm of the very distant and the very small; it also allows of metric knowledge. Knowing by means of language makes knowing explicit instead of tacit. Language permits descriptions and pools the accumu- lated observations of our ancestors. Knowing by means of pictures also extends perceiving and consolidates the gains of perceiving.

The awareness of imaginary entities and events might be ascribed to the operation of the perceptual system with a suspension of reality-testing. Imagination, as well as knowledge and perception, can be aroused by another person who uses language or makes pictures.

These tentative proposals are offered as a substitute for the outworn theory of past experience, memory, and mental images. This page intentionally left blank PART IV
