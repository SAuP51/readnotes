James J. Gibson.(1979.2014).2024079The-Ecological-Approach-to-Visual-Perception.Psychology Press => Preface

This book, first published in 1979, is about how we see: the environment around us (its surfaces, their layout, and their colors and textures); where we are in the environment; whether or not we are moving and, if we are, where we are going; what things are good for; how to do things (to thread a needle or drive an automobile); or why things look as they do.

The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -and what this book is about.

James J. Gibson (1904-1979) is one of the most important psychologists of the 20th Century, best known for his work on visual perception. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University and his first major work was The Perception of the Visual World(1950)in which he rejected behaviorism for a view based on his own experimental work.

In his later works, including The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception (1979), Gibson became more philosophical and criticized cognitivism in the same way he had attacked behaviorism before, arguing strongly in favor of direct perception and direct realism, as opposed to cognitivist indirect realism. He termed his new approach "ecological psychology".

Gibson's legacy is increasingly influential on many contemporary movements in psychology, particularly those considered to be post-cognitivist.

这本书首次出版于 1979 年，主要探讨了人类视觉感知的各个方面。它涵盖了我们如何感知周围的环境，包括环境的表面、布局、色彩和纹理；我们如何定位自己在环境中的位置；我们是否在移动，如果是，我们要去往何处；我们如何理解物体的功能；我们如何执行各种任务（例如像穿针或开车这样的日常活动）；以及为什么我们所看到的事物会呈现出特定的样子。

人们通常认为，视觉主要依赖于与大脑相连的眼睛。然而，作者提出了一个更全面的观点：自然视觉其实是一个复杂的系统，包括了我们的眼睛、头部、身体，以及我们所站立的地面。在这个系统中，大脑虽然重要，但只是整个视觉系统的核心处理器，而非全部。想象一下，当我们的视觉不受任何限制时，我们会怎么做？我们会自由地环顾四周，被有趣的东西吸引后走上前去，绕着它转圈观察每个细节，然后又被新的景象吸引，转而探索新的事物。这种自由自在、充满好奇的观察方式，就是作者所说的「自然视觉」。本书将深入探讨这种自然视觉的奥秘，帮助我们理解我们是如何真正地「看」这个世界的。

James J. Gibson（1904-1979）是 20 世纪最具影响力的心理学家之一，他在视觉感知研究领域做出了卓越贡献。Gibson 在普林斯顿大学获得博士学位后，于 1950 年出版了他的第一部重要著作《视觉世界的感知》（The Perception of the Visual World）。在这本书中，他突破性地摒弃了当时盛行的行为主义理论，转而提出了基于自身实验研究的全新观点。

随着研究的深入，Gibson 的思想逐渐向哲学层面延伸。在他 1979 年出版的《视觉感知的生态学方法》（The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception）等后期著作中，他开始批评认知主义，就像他早年批评行为主义一样。Gibson 强烈倡导直接感知（direct perception）和直接现实主义（direct realism）的观点，与认知主义者所持的间接现实主义（indirect realism）理论形成鲜明对比。他将这种新的研究方法命名为「生态心理学」（ecological psychology），开创了心理学研究的新范式。

Gibson 的学术思想对当代心理学的许多流派产生了越来越大的影响，尤其是对那些被视为后认知主义（post-cognitivist）的流派。

## Preface

Vision is a strange and wonderful business. I have been puzzling over its perplexities for 50 years. I used to suppose that the way to understand it was to learn what is accepted as true about the physics of light and the retinal image, to master the anatomy and physiology of the eye and the brain, and then to put it together into a theory of perception that could be tested by experiments. But the more I learned about physics, optics, anatomy, and visual physiology, the deeper the puzzles got. The experts in these sciences seemed confident that they could clear up the mysteries of vision eventually but only, I decided, because they had no real grasp of the perplexities.

Optical scientists, it appeared, knew about light as radiation but not about light considered as illumination. Anatomists knew about the eye as an organ but not about what it can do. Physiologists knew about the nerve cells in the retina and how they work but not how the visual system works. What they knew did not seem to be relevant. They could create holograms, prescribe spectacles, and cure diseases of the eye, and these are splendid accomplishments, but they could not explain vision.

Physics, optics, anatomy, and physiology describe facts, but not facts at a level appropriate for the study of perception. In this book I attempt a new level of description. It will be unfamiliar, and it is not fully developed, but it provides a fresh approach where the old perplexities do not block the way.

What are its antecedents? I am aware of my debt to the Gestalt psychologists, especially to Kurt Koffka. I have extended many of his ideas. I owe a great deal to the functionalists in American psychology, William James and E. B. Holt, for example. I was influenced in the thirties by Edward Tolman on the one hand, and by Leonard Troland on the other. The doctrine of stimuli and responses seems to me false, but I do not on that account reject behaviorism. Its influence is on the wane, no doubt, but a regression to mentalism would be worse. Why must we seek explanation in either Body or Mind? It is a false dichotomy. As for introspection, so-called, it can be done in the style of David Katz or Albert Michotte without falling into the error of elementarism.

I have learned a great deal from my contemporaries, Robert MacLeod, Ulric Neisser, Julian Hochberg, Ivo Kohler, Fabio Metelli, Hans Wallach, Ernst Gombrich, and especially Gunnar Johansson. My students, too, are my teachers, and since the listing in my last book, the principal influences are from James Farber, Thomas Lombardo, Harold Sedgewick, and Anthony Barrand. I also had a very early student who has become a contemporary as the years pass, Mary Henle. I thank all of them from the bottom of my heart.

There are several friends and colleagues who are pushing ahead with the ecological approach to psychology without having been my students. It would seem that they believe in it without persuasion. Robert Shaw, William Mace, Michael Turvey, and David Lee are scrambling through the underbrush along with me, and I am grateful for their company. So are Edward Reed and Rebecca Jones, who compiled the index.

This book has been written and revised in pieces over a period of ten years. So many helpful persons have read and criticized these pieces that I can only thank them as a group. But I am especially indebted to William Mace, Trinity College, Jacob Beck, University of Oregon, and Michael Turvey, University of Connecticut, for their criticisms of the final manuscript.

Above all there is the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Psychology at Cornell who worked very hard on this book, even if she did not write it. She is married to me, and we share responsibility for important decisions. Any errors in this book that remain are her fault as much as mine.

前言

视觉是一个奇妙而神秘的领域。五十年来，我一直在探索其中的奥秘。我曾经认为，要理解视觉，需要学习光的物理性质和视网膜图像的相关知识，掌握眼睛和大脑的解剖学和生理学，然后将这些知识整合成一个可以通过实验检验的感知理论。然而，我对物理学、光学、解剖学和视觉生理学了解越多，问题就变得越复杂。这些领域的专家们似乎很有信心最终能解开视觉的谜团，但我认为，他们之所以有这种信心，只是因为他们并没有真正理解这些问题的难点。

光学科学家了解光作为辐射的性质，但对光作为照明的理解不足。解剖学家了解眼睛的结构，但不清楚它的功能。生理学家了解视网膜中的神经细胞及其工作原理，但不了解整个视觉系统的运作。他们的知识虽然丰富，但似乎和解释视觉的问题关系不大。他们可以制作全息图，配眼镜，治愈眼疾，这些都是非凡的成就，但他们仍然无法解释视觉的本质。

物理学、光学、解剖学和生理学虽然描述了许多事实，但这些事实还不足以用于研究人类感知。在本书中，我尝试了一种新的描述方法。虽然这种方法尚不成熟，且可能会显得陌生，但它提供了一种新的视角，使得以往的困惑不再成为障碍。

这方法的起源是什么呢？我深知自己受到了格式塔心理学家的影响，特别是 Kurt Koffka。我扩展了他的许多想法。此外，我还非常感谢美国心理学中的功能主义者，比如 William James 和 E. B. Holt。在三十年代，Edward Tolman 和 Leonard Troland 对我也有很大的影响。我认为刺激-反应学说是错误的，但这并不意味着我要完全抛弃行为主义。尽管行为主义的影响正在减弱，但回归到心理主义会更糟。为什么我们必须在身体或心灵中寻找解释？这是一个错误的二分法。至于内省，它可以像 David Katz 或 Albert Michotte 那样进行，而不会陷入元素主义的错误。

我从许多同时代的学者中学到了很多，比如 Robert MacLeod、Ulric Neisser、Julian Hochberg、Ivo Kohler、Fabio Metelli、Hans Wallach、Ernst Gombrich，特别是 Gunnar Johansson。我的学生们也是我的老师，自从我上一本书出版以来，James Farber、Thomas Lombardo、Harold Sedgewick 和 Anthony Barrand 对我有很大的启发。我还有一位非常早期的学生，随着岁月的流逝，她已经成为我的同行，她是 Mary Henle。我从心底感谢他们所有人。

一些朋友和同事虽然不是我的学生，但也在积极推进生态心理学的研究。他们似乎无需说服就认同了这种方法。Robert Shaw、William Mace、Michael Turvey 和 David Lee 正在和我一起在这片未知的领域中探索，我非常感激他们的陪伴。Edward Reed 和 Rebecca Jones 也在其中，他们还编制了本书的索引。

这本书在过去的十年间逐步写成并多次修改。许多热心人士阅读并提出了宝贵的意见，我只能对他们一并表示感谢。但我特别要感谢 Trinity College 的 William Mace、University of Oregon 的 Jacob Beck 和 University of Connecticut 的 Michael Turvey 对最终稿的批评。

特别感谢 Cornell 大学的 Susan Linn Sage 心理学教授，她为这本书付出了大量努力，尽管她没有亲自撰写。她是我的妻子，我们共同做出了许多重要决策。书中如果仍有错误，那也是我们两人的责任。

## Introduction

This is a book about how we see. How do we see the environment around us? How do we see its surfaces, their layout, and their colors and textures? How do we see where we are in the environment? How do we see whether or not we are moving and, if we are, where we are going? How do we see what things are good for? How do we see how to do things, to thread a needle or drive an auto- mobile? Why do things look as they do?

This book is a sequel to The Perception of the Visual World, which came out in 1950. It is rather different, however, because my explanation of vision was then based on the retinal image, whereas it is now based on what I call the ambient optic array. I now believe we must take an ecological approach to the problems of perception.

We are told that vision depends on the eye, which is connected to the brain. I shall suggest that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system.

When no constraints are put on the visual system, we look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision, and that is what this book is about.

The textbooks and handbooks assume that vision is simplest when the eye is held still, as a camera has to be, so that a picture is formed that can be transmitted to the brain. Vision is studied by first requiring the subject to fixate a point and then exposing momentarily a stimulus or a pattern of stimuli around the fixation point. I call this snapshot vision. If the exposure period is made longer, the eye will scan the pattern to which it is exposed, fixating the parts in succession, unless the subject is prohibited from doing so. I call this aperture vision, for it is a little like looking at the environment through a knothole in a fence. The investigator assumes that each fixation of the eye is analogous to an exposure of the film in a camera, so that what the brain gets is something like a sequence of snapshots.

The headrest of the laboratory prevents the observer from turning his head and looking around, which provides what I will call ambient vision. It also, of course, prevents him from getting up and walking around, which provides ambulatory vision. Are these forms of vision? I suggest they are; in fact, they are the kind of vision we need in life, not just pictorial depth perception. We need to see all the way around at a given point of observation and to take different points of observation. The crux of the matter is whether or not natural vision is compounded of units like the snapshot. I very much doubt that vision is simplest when the experimenter tries to make the eye work as if it were a photographic camera, even the kind that takes pictures in rapid succession.

Looking around and getting around do not fit into the standard idea of what visual perception is. But note that if an animal has eyes at all it swivels its head around and it goes from place to place. The single, frozen field of view provides only impoverished information about the world. The visual system did not evolve for this. The evidence suggests that visual awareness is in fact panoramic and does in fact persist during long acts of locomotion.

Part I of this book is about the environment to be perceived. Part II is about the information for perception. Part III is about the activity of perception. Finally, Part IV is about pictures and the special kinds of awareness that go with looking at them. Picture vision comes last because it can be understood only after we are clear about ambient vision and ambulatory vision.

First, the environment must be described, since what there is to be perceived has to be stipulated before one can even talk about perceiving it. This is not the world of physics but the world at the level of ecology. Second, the information available for perception in an illuminated medium must be described. This is not just light for stimulating receptors but the information in the light that can activate the system. Ecological optics is required instead of classical optics. Third (and only here do we come to what is called psychology proper),the process of perception must be described. This is not the processing of sensory inputs, however, but the extracting of invariants from the stimulus flux. The old idea that sensory inputs are converted into perceptions by operations of the mind is rejected. A radically new way of thinking about perception is proposed.

The ecological approach to perception was adopted in my book The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems, which came out in 1966. Actually, it is a new approach to the whole field of psychology, for it involves rejecting the stimu- lus-response formula. This notion, borrowed from the so-called hard science of physiology, helped to get rid of the doctrine of the soul in psychology, but it never really worked. Neither mentalism on the one hand nor conditioned- response behaviorism on the other is good enough. What psychology needs is the kind of thinking that is beginning to be attempted in what is loosely called systems theory.

Environmentalism is a powerful movement nowadays, but in psychology it has generated more enthusiasm than discipline. There is no central core of theoretical concepts on which to base it. The right conceptual level has not yet been found. This book makes an effort to find the right level. A few psycholo- gists, such as E. Brunswik (1956)and R. G. Barker (1968), have moved in this direction, but none has ended with the sort of theory being put forward here.

The great virtue of the headrest, the bite-board, the exposure device, the tachistoscope, the darkroom with its points of light, and the laboratory with its carefully drawn pictorial stimuli was that they made it possible to study vision experimentally. The only way to be sure an observer sees what he says he does is to set up an experimental situation and check him out. Experimental verifica- tion can be trusted. These controls, however, made it seem as if snapshot vision and aperture vision were the whole of it, or at least the only vision that could be studied. But, on the contrary, natural vision can be studied experimentally. The experiments to be reported in Part III on perception involve the providing of optical information instead of the imposing of optical stimulation. It is not true that "the laboratory can never be like life." The laboratory must be like life!

It has to be admitted that the controlled displaying of information is vastly more difficult than the controlled applying of stimulation. Experimenters are just beginning to learn how to display information in a few scattered laborat- ories, at Cornell, Uppsala, the University of Connecticut, and Edinburgh. The experiments I will report in Part III are mostly my own, and the evidence, therefore, is scanty. Other students of information-based perception are at work, but the facts have not yet been accumulated. The vast quantity of exper- imental research in the textbooks and handbooks is concerned with snapshot vision, fixed-eye vision, or aperture vision, and it is not relevant. I do assure my readers that I know this body of research. I have even contributed to it. But they will have to take my word for it.

I am also asking the reader to suppose that the concept of space has nothing to do with perception. Geometrical space is a pure abstraction. Outer space can be visualized but cannot be seen. The cues for depth refer only to paintings, nothing more. The visual third dimension is a misapplication of Descartes's notion of three axes for a coordinate system.

The doctrine that we could not perceive the world around us unless we already had the concept of space is nonsense. It is quite the other way around: We could not conceive of empty space unless we could see the ground under our feet and the sky above. Space is a myth, a ghost, a fiction for geometers. All that sounds very strange, no doubt, but I urge the reader to entertain the hypothesis. For if you agree to abandon the dogma that "percepts without concepts are blind,"as Kant put it, a deep theoretical mess, a genuine quagmire, will dry up. This is one of the main themes of the chapters that follow.

A whole set of interesting facts about retinal photographic vision will not be described in this book--facts about vision with a fixed eye or vision with a shutter; such facts as the blind spot, the entoptic phenomena, the gaps in the visual field (scotomas), the afterimages of prolonged fixation, the tests for so-called acuity, the examining of the retina with an ophthalmoscope, the symptoms of eye disease, and the prescribing of corrective spectacles. These are the facts of ophthalmology and optometry and the psychophysiology of vision at the level of cells.

These facts all depend on the subject's being willing to hold his eye fixed like a camera. They are perfectly good facts, and they have their place. They are much better known than the facts with which this book is concerned, and their scientific status is such that those persons who specialize in them assume with confidence that physical and physiological optics provide the only basis for visual perception. But those persons have no conception of the perplexities to which their assumption leads. And there is a better basis for visual perception, as I shall try to show. 

简介

这是一本关于我们如何看见世界的书。我们是如何看见周围环境的？我们如何感知它们的表面、布局、颜色和纹理？我们如何知道自己在环境中的位置？我们如何判断自己是否在移动，如果在移动，又该去向何方？我们如何了解事物的用途？我们如何掌握做事的方法，比如穿针或驾驶汽车？为什么事物看起来是这个样子？

这本书是 1950 年出版的《视觉世界的感知》的续集。然而，它与前作有很大不同，因为我当时是基于视网膜图像来解释视觉，而现在我基于所谓的环境光学阵列。我现在认为，我们必须采取生态的方法来解决感知的问题。

通常我们认为视觉依赖于连接大脑的眼睛。但我认为自然视觉依赖于头部上的眼睛，而头部是由身体支撑在地面上的，大脑只是一个完整视觉系统的中心器官。

当视觉系统不受限制时，我们会环顾四周，走向有趣的事物，围绕它移动以从各个角度观察，并从一个景观移到另一个景观。这就是自然视觉，也是这本书的主题。

教科书和手册假设，当眼睛保持静止时，视觉是最简单的，就像相机需要保持静止一样，以便形成能够传输到大脑的图像。研究视觉的方法是首先要求受试者注视一个点，然后在注视点周围瞬间暴露一个刺激或一组刺激。我称之为快照视觉。如果曝光时间更长，眼睛将扫描暴露出的模式，逐一注视各个部分，除非禁止受试者这样做。我称之为孔径视觉，因为这有点像通过围栏上的一个小孔看环境。研究者假设每次眼睛的注视类似于相机胶片的曝光，因此大脑获取的东西有点像一系列快照。

实验室的头托防止观察者转动头部和环顾四周，这提供了我称之为环境视觉。当然，它也防止他起身走动，这提供了步行视觉。这些是视觉形式吗？我建议它们是；实际上，它们是我们生活中所需的那种视觉，而不仅仅是图像深度感知。我们需要在一个观察点看到周围的一切，并且需要从不同的观察点观察。问题的关键在于自然视觉是否由类似快照的单位组成。我非常怀疑当实验者试图让眼睛像照相机一样工作时，视觉是最简单的，即使是那种快速连续拍照的相机。

环顾四周和四处走动并不符合传统的视觉感知概念。但请注意，如果动物有眼睛，它会转动头部并在各处移动。单一、固定的视野只能提供有限的世界信息。视觉系统并不是为了这种情况而进化的。证据表明，视觉意识实际上是全景式的，并且在长时间移动过程中也会持续存在。

本书的第一部分讨论的是感知的环境。第二部分探讨感知的信息。第三部分介绍感知的活动。最后，第四部分则是关于图片以及与观察图片相关的特殊感知类型。最后讨论图片视觉是因为只有在理解了环境视觉和行走视觉之后，才能更好地理解它。

首先，需要描述环境，因为在讨论感知之前，必须明确要感知的对象。这不是物理学的世界，而是生态学层面的世界。其次，需要描述在光照媒介中可用于感知的信息。这不仅仅是光刺激受体，而是光中能够激活系统的信息。因此需要的是生态光学，而不是经典光学。第三（这里才真正进入心理学的范畴），需要描述感知过程。这并不是处理感官输入，而是从刺激流中提取不变性。旧的观点认为感官输入通过心理操作转化为感知，这种观点被否定了。提出了一种全新的感知思维方式。

我在 1966 年出版的《作为感知系统的感觉》一书中采用了生态学的感知方法。实际上，这是一种全新的心理学方法，因为它拒绝了传统的刺激-反应公式。这一公式源于所谓的生理学硬科学，虽然帮助我们摆脱了心理学中的灵魂学说，但并未真正奏效。无论是精神主义还是条件反应行为主义都不够完善。心理学需要的是一种类似于系统理论的新思维方式。

如今，环境主义是一股强大的潮流，但在心理学中，它带来的热情多于严谨。我们还没有找到一个可以作为基础的核心理论概念，也没有找到合适的概念层次。本书尝试寻找这样的层次。一些心理学家，如 E. Brunswik（1956）和 R. G. Barker（1968）已经朝这个方向迈进，但没有提出本书所探讨的这种理论。

头靠、咬板、曝光设备、视诊器、有光点的暗室以及精心绘制的视觉刺激实验室的一个巨大优点在于，它们使得实验性地研究视觉成为可能。要确保观察者看到的确实是他所说的东西，唯一的方法就是建立一个实验情境并进行检查。实验验证是可靠的。然而，这些控制措施使人们误以为快照视觉和孔径视觉就是全部，或至少是唯一可以研究的视觉。实际上，自然视觉也是可以通过实验研究的。在第三部分中，我们将报告一些关于感知的实验，这些实验侧重于提供光学信息，而不是强加光学刺激。说「实验室永远不能像生活」是不对的。实验室必须像生活一样！

不得不承认，控制信息显示比控制刺激施加要困难得多。实验者们刚刚在康奈尔大学、乌普萨拉大学、康涅狄格大学和爱丁堡大学的几个实验室中开始学习如何有效地显示信息。我将在第三部分介绍的大多数实验都是我自己的，因此证据还很有限。其他研究信息感知的学者也在进行相关工作，但目前数据尚未积累。教科书和手册中大量的实验研究主要涉及快照视觉、固定眼视觉或孔视野，这些都不相关。我向读者保证，我了解这些研究，甚至也有所贡献。但请相信我的判断。

我还希望读者假设空间概念与感知无关。几何空间只是纯粹的抽象概念。外部空间可以被想象，但无法直接看到。深度线索只适用于绘画，仅此而已。视觉上的第三维度是对笛卡尔三轴坐标系统概念的误用。

认为我们无法感知周围世界，除非先有空间概念的学说是不合理的。实际上恰恰相反：只有当我们能看到脚下的地面和头顶的天空时，我们才能想象出空旷的空间。空间对于几何学家来说是一个神话，一个虚构的概念。这听起来可能很奇怪，但我鼓励读者接受这个假设。如果你同意放弃康德所说的「没有概念的感知是盲目的」这一观点，一个深刻的理论困境将会迎刃而解。这也是接下来章节中的主要主题之一。

本书不会描述一系列关于视网膜摄影视觉的有趣事实 —— 如固定眼睛或快门视觉的现象；包括盲点、内眼现象、视野中的空白（暗点)、长时间凝视后的残像、视力测试、用眼底镜检查视网膜、眼病症状以及配戴矫正眼镜的相关知识。这些内容属于眼科、验光学及细胞层面的视觉心理生理学范畴。

这些现象都依赖于受试者能够像相机一样固定住眼睛。它们完全是正确的事实，并且具有其重要性。相比之下，它们比本书所讨论的内容更为人熟知，这些领域的专家也自信地认为，物理和生理光学提供了视觉感知的唯一基础。然而，他们并没有意识到这种假设所带来的困惑。而实际上，还有一种更好的视觉感知基础，正如我将在书中展示的那样。

## Introduction to the Classic Edition 

William M. Mace

The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception has been available in English for 35 years (as of this writing in 2014). It has captured a substantial audience, including those reading it in German and Japanese. A Polish translation currently is being planned. As befits a classic, it is still possible to promise new readers that they will find "something completely different"here and to assure those who have read it before that it's worth reading again.

This book marked the culmination of the development of James J. Gibson's thought, not because his thoughts were completed but because he died of pancreatic cancer at the end of 1979, the same year the book was published. See Neisser(1981), Pick, Pick, Jones and Reed (1982), and Hochberg (1994)for memorial remarks. Officially, this was Gibson's third book. Unofficially it could be called the fourth because his 1950 book included much from a book length Army Air Corps report (Gibson, 1947). Gibson's first reformulation of the main topics in visual perception was in The Perception of the Visual World (Gibson, 1950). This book was followed by a reconceptualization of all the "senses"in The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966) and then finally, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception, which started out as a revi- sion of the 1950 book but became much more than that.

Gibson's publishing career began in 1929. He was an honored (for his exper- imental work)senior figure in experimental psychology by the time the first book appeared. It was 16 years until the publication of the second book [although his chapter for the Koch series (Gibson, 1959)was a major state- ment], and another 13 years to the last one. Gibson was continuously at work throughout his career, and he stayed remarkably focused on the same issues from his work in World War II until his death. His books are like progress reports summarizing his thinking up to the final editing. By the time a book was published, he had already started to extend and revise the work until it crystallized into the next book.

Gibson developed his thinking through relentless revisions of his own published work. His personal copies of the first two books were densely marked with annotations beginning with phrases like "Egads! How could I have believed this?"or, more temperately, "Here is what I should have said"followed by a positive statement. Preliminary versions of his ideas began as short memos prepared for this perpetual Thursday afternoon seminar at Cornell. At these meetings, Gibson would distribute a one-page document (sometimes longer). These papers might state a thesis and outline an argument. Sometimes they were a list of provocative questions, sometimes a tentative classification. Copies of these short pieces also were sent to colleagues on his mailing list. Because they were reproduced in a "ditto" process that printed in aromatic purple, students came to call these "purple perils."1

The chapters in his second two books developed in this stepwise fashion- from notes in book margins to "purple perils"to published papers or lectures to more formal statements. Chapter 8 in this 1979 book, "The Theory of Affordances,"is one example of this method of work. There were multiple "purple perils"on affordances and a small section on affordances in the 1966 book. Gibson gave lectures on affordances, including one lecture at a 1973 conference that was revised and published in 1977 (Shaw Bransford, 1977) Chapter 8 here is a further revision of that 1977 chapter. Gibson had completed drafts of nearly all of the chapters for this final book by the spring of 1977 and circulated them to colleagues. Therefore final versions of most chapters in this book are the product of multiple revisions based on Gibson's own self-criticism and his reflections on remarks from colleagues.

经典版序言

William M. Mace

《视觉感知的生态学方法》自 35 年前（截至 2014 年）以英语出版以来，已经吸引了大量读者，包括那些阅读德语和日语版本的读者。目前，波兰语翻译也在计划中。作为一本经典之作，仍然可以向新读者承诺，他们将在这里找到「完全不同的东西」，并向那些以前读过的人保证，这本书值得再读一遍。

这本书代表了 James J. Gibson 思想发展的巅峰，不是因为他的思想已经完成，而是因为他在 1979 年底因胰腺癌去世，而这本书也是在同年出版的。参见 Neisser（1981)、Pick、Pick、Jones 和 Reed（1982）及 Hochberg（1994）的纪念文章。官方来说，这是 Gibson 的第三本书。但非正式地，可以认为这是他的第四本书，因为他 1950 年的书中包含了大量来自 1947 年他为陆军航空队撰写的报告的内容。Gibson 首次对视觉感知的主要主题进行了重新表述，这体现在他 1950 年出版的《视觉世界的感知》中。随后，他对所有感官进行了重新定义，发表了《作为感知系统的感官》(1966)，最后则是《视觉感知的生态学方法》。这本书最初只是 1950 年书的修订版，但最终超越了原来的内容。

Gibson 的出版生涯始于 1929 年。当他出版第一本书时，他已经因其实验工作而成为备受尊敬的实验心理学家。从第一本书到第二本书之间隔了 16 年【尽管他在 1959 年为 Koch 系列撰写的章节是一个重要声明】，再到最后一本书又过了 13 年。Gibson 在其职业生涯中一直在研究，并且从二战时期的工作开始直到去世，他始终专注于同样的问题。他的书就像是进度报告，概述了他在最终定稿前的思考。每当一本书出版时，他已经开始扩展和修订工作，直到这些工作结晶为下一本书。

Gibson 通过不断修改自己发表的作品来完善他的思想。他自己保留的前两本书的副本上密密麻麻地写满了注释，通常开头是这样的句子：「天哪！我怎么会相信这种东西？」或者更温和地说，「这是我应该说的」，后面跟着一个肯定的陈述。他的初步想法最早是为康奈尔大学每周四下午的研讨会准备的简短备忘录。在这些会议上，Gibson 会分发一页纸的文件（有时更长）。这些文件可能会陈述一个论点并概述一个论据。有时它们是一系列挑衅性的问题，有时是一个初步的分类。这些短文的副本也会发送给他邮寄名单上的同事。由于它们是通过一种带有芳香紫色打印油墨的「复写」过程复制的，学生们称之为「紫色警报」。

他后两本书中的章节就是这样逐步发展起来的 —— 从书页边缘的笔记，到「紫色警报」，再到发表的论文或讲座，最终形成更正式的陈述。1979 年这本书的第 8 章「可供性理论」就是这种工作方法的一个例子。有许多关于可供性的「紫色警报」，并且 1966 年的书中有一小部分内容也是关于可供性的。Gibson 就可供性发表了多次讲座，包括在 1973 年的一次会议上的讲座，该讲座经过修改并于 1977 年发表（Shaw Bransford, 1977）。这里的第 8 章是 1977 年章节的进一步修订。到 1977 年春天，Gibson 已经完成了几乎所有章节的草稿，并将它们分发给同事。因此，本书中大多数章节的最终版本都是基于 Gibson 自我批评和同事评论的多次修订的产物。

The Perception of the Visual World - 1950

Gibson's 1950 book was his "airplane landing" book, the legacy of his World War II research on the use of film to teach flying to pilots (Gibson, 1947). This featured the role of the ground, the surface of the earth. When a pilot is in the clouds there is nothing to see outside the plane, and it can be very disorienting. When the pilot comes out of the clouds and sees the ground and sky meeting at the horizon, the pilot can orient. Vision is clear and useful again. Gibson proposed that the extended earth, something real that can be seen, played the role of "space" in vision. Rather than positing an empty, mental coordinate space as a framework for vision, Gibson was advocating a "filled"space--which really was not a "space"at all but a plenum. He called this "ground"theory and contrasted it with "air" theory, which is what he called the traditional ideas about space from Newton, Berkeley, and Kant. Gibson recognized that the patterning of surfaces, beginning with the ground, was a gradient of surface textures. A texture gradient, Gibson showed, could specify the slant of a surface. Gibson then reformulated classic topics in vision around these texture gradients, such as size constancy. This problem of size constancy arises from the fact that the projected size of an object on the retina changes as the object's distance from the perceiver changes. With the notion of texture gradients in hand, he pointed out that the projective geometry of the receding ground to the eye is the same as that of obiects on the ground as they recede into the distance. As a consequence. an object resting on the ground hides or occludes the same number of ground texture units regardless of its distance from the observer. This relation of object to supporting ground surface then remains the same from near to far. Gibson proposed that perceiving other constant object properties, such as shape, would make more sense if, in a case like this, something detectable actually was constant. In the present case, even though the projective size of an object gets smaller with increasing distance from a point of observation, there is a visible relation that is invariant and hence can be the basis for size constancy.

What was of lasting importance in this work was Gibson's showing, first, that what counted as the "stimulus"for vision could be an obiect of research and, second, that it was feasible to find a correspondence between optical patterns and properties of the world if one matched the right optical pattern with the right environmental property. Questioning what could count as a unit for vision was commonplace for Gestalt psychologists, and Gibson was explicit about the debt he owed to Kurt Koffka, with whom he shared a seminar in their years together at Smith College. The Gestalt psychologists, however, thought of the organization in experience as resulting from brain processes. Gibson argued that organization, such as the object-background invariant, was in the world and that the program of trying to find characterizations of pattern that corresponded to aspects of the world was both feasible and necessary.

Between the 1950 book and the 1966 book, Gibson moved from thinking about what patterns could act as stimuli to rethinking the concept of the stim- ulus itself, ultimately rejecting "stimulus" in favor of his version of "informa- tion."In a paper that is a classic in its own right, Gibson (1960) carefully surveyed the patchwork of meanings of the term"stimulus"that could be found in the literature. He concluded that the optical (or acoustic, or haptic etc.) patterning that would best correspond to actual perceiving in the world no longer seemed like a"stimulus"at all in any proper sense. Instead, he proposed a common-sense usage of the term"information"(as opposed to the technical usage of Shannon) which was fairly well developed by the time he published his next book. By information. Gibson meant structured energy that was informa- tion about environmental sources, in contrast to information as structure in an information theoretical sense which implies a sender and a receiver. Gibson's information is specific to its environmental sources though not a replica or a copy It certainly is not a stimulus in the sense of energy that triggers a response.

Gibson's information does not come to the animal. The animal goes to it, actively obtaining the information. Part 2 of this 1979 volume develops this concept of information and is at the heart of Gibson's theory.

《视觉世界的感知》 - 1950

Gibson 在 1950 年出版了一本书，被称为他的「飞机降落」书，这是他二战期间通过电影教授飞行员飞行研究的成果（Gibson, 1947）。这本书强调了地面的作用，即地球的表面。当飞行员在云层中飞行时，外面什么也看不见，容易迷失方向。而当飞行员飞出云层，看到地面和天空在地平线相接时，就能重新定向，视野也变得清晰有用。Gibson 提出了地球的延伸，即可见的真实事物在视觉中扮演了「空间」的角色。他并不认同将一个空的、心理的坐标空间作为视觉的框架，而是倡导一个充实的空间 —— 实际上这并不是一个「空间」，而是一个充满的实体。他称之为「地面」理论，并将其与他称之为「空气」理论的传统空间观点（源自 Newton、Berkeley 和 Kant）进行对比。Gibson 认识到，从地面开始的表面模式是表面纹理的梯度。Gibson 证明，纹理梯度可以指示表面的倾斜度。随后，他围绕这些纹理梯度重新解释了视觉中的经典主题，例如大小恒常性。大小恒常性的问题在于物体在视网膜上的投影大小会随着物体距离观察者的远近而变化。掌握了纹理梯度的概念后，Gibson 指出，后退的地面到眼睛的投影几何与地面上物体随着距离增加而变小的投影几何是相同的。因此，无论物体与观察者的距离如何，地面上的物体都会遮挡相同数量的地面纹理单位。这样，物体与支撑它的地面表面的关系在远近之间保持不变。Gibson 提出，感知其他恒定的物体属性（如形状）会更有意义，因为在这种情况下，有些可检测的东西实际上是恒定的。在这种情况下，虽然物体的投影大小会随着观察点距离的增加而变小，但存在一个不变的可见关系，因此可以成为大小恒常性的基础。

Gibson 的这项工作之所以重要，主要有两点：首先，他证明视觉中的「刺激」是可以进行研究的；其次，通过将合适的光学模式与环境特性相匹配，可以找到它们之间的对应关系。格式塔心理学家们常常探讨什么可以作为视觉的基本单位，Gibson 也表示他受到了 Kurt Koffka 的影响，他们曾在 Smith College 一起上过研讨课。然而，格式塔心理学家认为，体验中的组织是由大脑过程决定的。Gibson 则认为，诸如物体和背景的不变关系这样的组织存在于现实世界中，因此，寻找与世界特性相对应的模式特征是既可行又必要的。

在 1950 年的书和 1966 年的书之间，Gibson 从思考什么样的模式可以作为刺激物，转而重新审视刺激物的概念，最终放弃了「刺激物」，采用了他自己定义的「信息」概念。在一篇经典论文中，Gibson（1960）仔细研究了文献中「刺激物」一词的各种含义。他得出结论，最能反映实际感知的光学（或声学、触觉等）模式在严格意义上已经不再像「刺激物」。相反，他提出了一种常识性的「信息」用法（与 Shannon 的技术用法不同），这种用法在他出版下一本书时已经相当成熟。Gibson 所说的信息是关于环境源的结构化能量，而不是信息理论意义上的结构，这种结构通常意味着有发送者和接收者。Gibson 的信息是特定于环境源的，尽管它并不是环境源的复制品或副本。它显然不是那种能触发反应的能量刺激物。

Gibson 的信息不会主动到达动物那里，而是动物主动去获取信息。这本 1979 年的书的第 2 部分详细阐述了这一信息概念，这是 Gibson 理论的核心。

The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems - 1966

The 1966 book presented the results of Gibson's re-thinking of the concept of "stimulus"as applied not only to vision, but to each of the classic "senses."He showed that if one re-thinks what a stimulus is, and how stimulation (now information)is informative about the world, there are necessary consequences for how a scientist conceptualizes the systems that are sensitive to this inform- ation. From this starting point, he offered his thoroughly functional view of how physiology would be conceived in light of his new ideas about the stim- ulus. What was featured was Gibson's novel notion of a perceptual system. He contrasted "imposed" with "obtained" information, emphasizing the latter. With "obtained"information, the animal goes to it, as it were, rather than the stimulation coming to or being merely impressed on the animal's receptors. Sensing was not simply whatever was delivered by the anatomical structure of sense organs. Sense organs did not deliver sensations to the brain or mind. subsequently to be made meaningful perception by cognitive processes. For Gibson, perception was not constructed from the building blocks of sensations. Rather, there were perceptual functions, activities of an intentional animal for the purpose of detecting information specific to itself and to the environment. In a reciprocal loop, action leads to the detection of information, and informa- tion plays a vital role in controlling action.

Perceptual systems, in contrast to the senses as channels of sensation, are whole body activities devoted to actively extracting, isolating, or clarifying informative structure in the world. For Gibson, there is structure specific to both an animal's own movements and properties of the environment in every system. Besides the "basic orienting system", Gibson examined the auditory, haptic-somatic, tasting and smelling, and visual systems from the perceptual systems point of view. The "basic orienting"system is where Gibson treats the vestibular system and its evolution. His unique and consistent treatment of animal"sensory"systems in animal physiology is well illustrated here, emphas- izing the role of the system in detecting environmental information used for the active control of behavior. Orienting, of course, is a broad functional activity supported by all of the perceptual systems, separately and together. Thus the controlled environmental adjustments Gibson associates with this "basic orienting"system are elaborated in his treatment of the other perceptual systems. As I have noted elsewhere (Mace, 1977), a good illustration of the contrast between a perceptual system and a traditional sense is what happens when an animal wants to get a close look at something far away. A Gibsonian perceptual system, here the visual system, involves the eyes moving relative to the head, the head moving relative to the body, and the body moving in the environment in the activity of clarifying structure specific to the object. The animal has to get closer, and to do that might locomote. That is, it uses its legs in the interest of seeing more clearly. The legs are operating as part of the visual perceptual system The activity of the visual system does not begin at the moment of being "stimulated" by the distant object. Rather, it is operating continuously in the service of detecting information in the reflected light that specifies the object. Gibson stressed the capacity of animals to actively control what they can see, hear, smell, and feel in their normal habitat. That level of controlled activity in the environment surely must involve the whole body in these perceptual activities.

《作为感知系统的感觉》- 1966

1966 年，Gibson 在书中重新审视了「刺激」这一概念，认为它不仅适用于视觉，还涉及到所有经典的「感官」。他指出，如果我们重新定义刺激，并理解刺激（即信息）如何传递世界的信息，那么科学家在理解对这些信息敏感的系统时，就必须重新构思。从这个起点出发，Gibson 提出了一个全新的生理学观点，基于他对刺激的新理念。

Gibson 的核心观点是知觉系统的概念。他区分了「强加的」信息和「获取的」信息，强调了后者。对于「获取的」信息，动物主动去获取，而不是被动地接受刺激。感觉不仅仅是由感觉器官的结构传递的，感觉器官不会简单地把感觉传递给大脑或心灵，再通过认知过程使其成为有意义的知觉。对于 Gibson 来说，知觉不是由感觉的碎片拼凑而成的。相反，知觉是有目的的动物为了检测特定于自身和环境的信息而进行的活动。行动和信息检测之间形成了一个循环，信息在控制行动中起着至关重要的作用。

感知系统与仅作为感觉通道的感官不同，它是全身参与的活动，旨在主动提取、分离或澄清世界中的信息结构。Gibson 认为，每个系统中都包含特定于动物自身运动和环境特性的结构。除了「基本定向系统」外，Gibson 还从感知系统的角度研究了听觉、触觉-体感、味觉和嗅觉以及视觉系统。「基本定向」系统是 Gibson 研究前庭系统及其进化的领域。他在动物生理学中独特而一致地处理动物「感觉」系统，强调了这些系统在检测用于行为主动控制的环境信息中的作用。

定向是一种由所有感知系统共同支持的广泛功能活动。因此，Gibson 在处理其他感知系统时，详细阐述了与「基本定向」系统相关的受控环境调整。正如我在其他地方（Mace, 1977）指出的，一个感知系统与传统感官之间对比的好例子是，当动物想要近距离观察远处的物体时。Gibson 的感知系统 —— 在这里是指视觉系统 —— 包括眼睛相对于头部的移动，头部相对于身体的移动，以及身体在环境中的移动，以便澄清特定于物体的结构。动物需要靠近目标，为此可能需要移动，也就是说，它使用腿来更清楚地看到。腿在这里作为视觉感知系统的一部分在工作。视觉系统的活动并不是在被远处物体「刺激」时才开始的，而是持续运作的，以检测反射光中提供的物体信息。Gibson 强调动物在其正常栖息地中主动控制它们所能看到、听到、闻到和感觉到的能力。这种在环境中受控的活动水平无疑需要全身参与这些感知活动。

The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception - 1979

The overall structure of The Ecological Approach is in 4 parts- Significantly, Part I is about what the environment consists of and Part IV is about the perceiving of representations of the environment, such as still pictures. This order inverts the standard analysis of vision. Standard analyses flow from the presumption that what is "given"is a pair of flat retinal images. With this starting point, the analysis of visual perception is akin to considering how one perceives pictures. But this seemingly innocent step introduces difficulties from the outset. When we perceive the world visually, the world is not flat. Nor is the visual world doubled and nor is there a hole at the blind spot. Gibson avoided these dilemmas by beginning with an analysis of the environment that an animal sees (Part I) and the way that environment structures light (Part II). In other words, he begins by considering "what is there to be perceived." After all, perceiving processes have emerged over phylogenesis in relation to organ- isms'econiche. An analysis of vision must begin with the task at hand, that of guiding action and detecting environmental properties. We should bear in mind that different "solutions"have been arrived at over time, chambered mammalian eyes with retinal images, being but one. Framing the analysis of perceiving in this way brings to the forefront a concern for the nature of the perceived environment ("what is perceived")before considering the anatom- ical structure of the eye. What ensues is Gibson's treatment of the structure of reflected light in the ambient optical array. Part III examines the process of picking up the informative structure carried in the ambient array and here the notion of perceptual systems is reintroduced. Also presented in this part of the book is a summary of empirical research that revealed some of the information that can be detected by a moving perceiver. Placing the topics of depiction (pictures and film) at the end of the book (Part IV) highlights Gibson's view that these are higher order phenomena that depend first on how perceiving in the real environment works. Pictures, especially for Gibson, are derivative, not foundational. Hence the topic goes at the end of the book, not the beginning.

An especially noteworthy chapter in Part III concerns Gibson's and his student George Kaplan's "discovery of the occluding edge." When surface texture is gradually revealed (accretion) or occluded (deletion) over time at the edge of another surface, there is unambiguous evidence that the former surface is farther away from the perceiver then the latter surface. Typically, occluding edges are revealed with movements of the perceiver, and relative movements of environmental features. There are several significant implications of this phenomenon. First, the occluding edge of closer surface is only visible over time. Second, for this reason, the occluding edge is a relational property of the environment-organism processes. In the absence of movement, the occluding edge is not present. Gibson is pointing to the often overlooked ontology of rela- tional properties, which comes to play a foundational role in the proposed ecological approach. Third, perceiving an occluding edge includes an aware- ness of the now-hidden surface and to-be-revealed surface of the farther object. In other words, perceiving has both retrospectivity and prospectivity; it is past- oriented and future-oriented. As William James pointed out, the notion of the present is "specious"from the stance of an active organism-which constitutes yet another challenge to the "picture theory of vision.'

After presenting the major features of his theory and the supporting evid- ence in the first 13 chapters, Gibson lists the highlights of his position in Chapter 14, "The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences."He states that "The theory of information pickup differs radically from the tradi- tional theories of perception" and follows with several distinctive features of the theory. These features include: "a new notion of perception, not just a new theory of the process; ""a new assumption about what there is to be perceived;" "a new conception of the information for perception, with two kinds always available, one about the environment and another about the self:""the new assumption of perceptual systems; and optical information pickup [that] entails an activity of the system not heretofore imagined by any visual scientist, the concurrent registering of both persistence and change in the flow of structured stimulation." With respect to the later, he notes that "this is the crux of the theory."

Each of these distinctive qualities of Gibson's theory is discussed extensively in the book. I will stress the first point here and leave the others for the reader. I stress the first one because, in my experience, it has not been as widely appreciated as some of the others,.

Succinct expressions of the "new notion of perception" can be found in the next subsection of Chapter 14, "A redefinition of perception," and later in the same chapter in the Section called "A new approach to nonperceptual aware- ness"where he again characterizes what he means by perception in order to show that it forces a re-thinking of other putative processes like memory. thinking, and imagining. Under "A redefinition of perception"he writes, "Perceiving is an achievement of the individual, not an experience in the theatre of consciousness. It is a keeping-in-touch with the world, an experiencing of things rather than a having of experiences. "The act of picking up informa- tion, moreover, is a continuous act, an activity that is ceaseless and unbroken. 'The continuous act of perceiving involves the coperceiving of the self."

Then, later in the chapter, he writes, "To perceive is to be aware of the surfaces of the environment and of oneself in it. The interchange between hidden and unhidden surfaces is essential to this awareness. These are existing surfaces; they are specified at some points of observation. Perceiving gets wider and finer and longer and richer and fuller as the observer explores the environ- ment. The full awareness of surfaces includes their layout, their substances, their events. and their affordances. Note how this definition includes within perception a part of memory, expectation, knowledge, and meaning-some part but not all of those mental processes in each case."

Being in direct perceptual contact with the environment is contrasted with being in direct perceptual contact with something that mediates between the animal and environment. As Gibson says at the beginning of Chapter 9, "Direct perception is what one gets from seeing Niagara Falls, say, as distinguished from seeing a picture of it." Sometimes it is asserted that in Gibson's sense of direct perception, perceiving is accurate. While true in a sense, it also can be misleading. The environment is indefinitely rich. No animal can perceive beyond a small fraction of it, so "perceiving the environment"cannot possibly mean perceiving all of it. Thus Gibson said that "Perceiving gets wider and finer and longer and richer and fuller as the observer explores the environment." Being "in touch with" or "aware of" means being able to guide one's activity to formulate goals and accomplish them.

In the section, "The relationship between imagining and perceiving" in Chapter 14. Gibson lists perceptual tests for reality. These are crucial to under- standing Gibson's claims for the fidelity of optical structure. He illustrates by showing the difference between the optical structure of an image and the optical structure of substantial, persisting, surfaces in the world. First, consider accom- modation of the lens in a mammalian eye. Accommodation clarifies texture on real surfaces, not images. Second, surfaces become clearer with fixation. Third. a surface can be scanned (as opposed to an image). Fourth, an object can be scrutinized. Indeed, Gibson says, "The most decisive test for reality is whether you can discover new features and details by the act of scrutiny. Can you obtain new stimulation and extract new information from it? Is the information inex- haustible? Is there more to be seen? The imaginary scrutiny of an imaginary entity cannot pass the test."He adds, "A related criterion for the existence of a thing is reversible occlusion. Whatever goes out of sight as you move your head and comes into sight as you move back is a persisting surface."

Thus, perception of the environment consisting of substantial surfaces, as opposed to any surrogate, can be direct because the change and associated non- change is distinct from anything non-real.

The last point I want to make about this book is the persistent contact with research findings. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 are set aside to review relevant research findings. Because Gibson offered a broad, comprehensive theory, comment- ators have sometimes neglected the degree to which Gibson was concerned with accounting for research results. He often claimed to have formulated or changed an idea because of findings he was trying to understand A good example comes from prism studies. He was always challenged to interpret che results of people like Stratton and Ivo Kohler whose observers adjusted to extraordinary optical transformations over periods of hours, days, and weeks. Stratton's apparatus had people looking at the world "upside down." Where many psychologists draw the lesson of brain plasticity from such studies, Gibson asked what it was that prism wearers (for example) were adjusting to. He realized at some level of abstraction that there had to be information for the stability of the environment there all along. Thus, instead of emphasizing the plasticity of the eye-brain-body system, Gibson emphasized what had to be true about the world for the perceptual system to arrive at an equilibrium. I urge the reader to appreciate the importance to Gibson of those chapters about experiments.

《视觉知觉的生态学方法》 - 1979

《生态学的方法》整体结构分为四部分。第一部分讲述环境的组成，第四部分探讨如何感知环境的表征，例如静态图片。这种编排顺序与传统的视觉分析方法相反。传统方法认为「给定」的是两张平面的视网膜图像，从这个角度出发，视觉感知的分析就像是研究如何看图片。然而，这种看似简单的假设从一开始就带来了问题。我们用眼睛感知的世界并不是平面的，也不是双重的，也没有盲点的孔洞。Gibson 通过从动物所看到的环境分析（第一部分）和环境如何形成光（第二部分）开始，避开了这些难题。换句话说，他首先关注「有什么可以被感知」。毕竟，感知过程是在生物进化中与生物生态位相关的。视觉分析必须从实际任务出发，即如何指导行动和检测环境特征。我们要注意的是，随着时间推移，不同的「解决方案」已经被提出，例如拥有视网膜图像的哺乳动物眼睛。以这种方式进行感知分析，强调了对感知环境特征（什么是被感知的）的重视，然后再考虑眼睛的解剖结构。接下来，Gibson 讨论了环境光阵列中反射光的结构。第三部分探讨了如何获取环境光阵列中携带的信息结构，并重新介绍了感知系统的概念。本书这一部分还总结了实证研究，揭示了移动感知者可以检测到的一些信息。Gibson 把描绘（如图片和电影）的讨论放在书的结尾（第四部分），强调了这些现象是基于我们如何在真实环境中感知的高级现象。对于 Gibson 来说，图片是派生的，而非基础。因此，这个主题放在书的结尾，而不是开头。

在第 III 部分中，有一章特别值得关注，讨论了 Gibson 和他的学生 George Kaplan 发现的「遮挡边缘」现象。当一个表面的纹理逐渐显现（积累）或被另一个表面的边缘遮住（删除）时，这说明前一个表面比后一个表面离观察者更远。通常，随着观察者的移动和环境的变化，遮挡边缘会显露出来。这一现象有几个重要的启示。首先，较近表面的遮挡边缘只有随着时间的推移才能看到。其次，因此遮挡边缘是环境和有机体之间交互的特性，在静止时并不存在。Gibson 强调，这种关系特性常常被忽视，但在他提出的生态学方法中却是基础性的。第三，感知遮挡边缘时，人们会意识到被隐藏的表面和即将显现的更远物体的表面。换句话说，感知过程既包含对过去的回顾，也包含对未来的展望。正如 William James 所说，从一个活跃的有机体的角度来看，「现在」是一个「虚幻」的概念，这对「视觉图像理论」提出了挑战。





Gibson 在前 13 章介绍了他的理论的主要特征和支持证据后，在第 14 章「信息获取理论及其后果」中列出了他立场的要点。他指出，「信息获取理论与传统的感知理论有根本的不同」，并接着列出了该理论的几个独特特征。这些特征包括：「一种新的感知概念，不仅仅是一个关于过程的新理论；」「关于可感知对象的新假设；」「对感知信息的新概念，总是有两种信息可用，一种关于环境，另一种关于自我；」「感知系统的新假设；」以及「光学信息获取需要系统进行一种以前任何视觉科学家都未曾想象过的活动，同时记录结构化刺激流中的持久性和变化。」关于光学信息获取，他指出，「这是理论的关键。」

Gibson 理论的每一个独特特质在书中都有详细讨论。我将在这里强调第一个要点，并将其他要点留给读者自行探索。我之所以强调第一个要点，是因为根据我的经验，它没有像其他一些要点那样广泛被认可。

「新知觉概念的简洁表达」可以在第 14 章的下一个小节「知觉的重新定义」中找到，稍后在同一章的「非知觉意识的新方法」一节中，他再次描述了他所指的知觉，以展示它如何迫使我们重新思考诸如记忆、思考和想象等其他所谓的过程。在「知觉的重新定义」中，他写道：「知觉是个体的成就，而不是意识剧场中的一种体验。它是一种与世界保持联系的方式，是对事物的体验而不是拥有体验。」此外，获取信息的行为是一个连续不断的活动。「连续的知觉行为涉及自我的共同知觉。」

然后，在本章的后面，他写道：「知觉是对环境表面和自身表面的意识。隐藏和显露表面之间的交替对于这种意识是至关重要的。这些表面是存在的；它们在某些观察点被具体化。随着观察者探索环境，知觉变得更广泛、更细致、更长久、更丰富和更完整。对表面的全面意识包括它们的布局、它们的物质、它们的事件和它们的可供性。注意，这一定义在知觉中包含了部分记忆、期望、知识和意义 —— 在每种情况下都有一部分，但不包括所有这些心理过程。」

与直接感知环境相比，感知某种介于动物与环境之间的中介是有所不同的。正如 Gibson 在第 9 章开头提到的那样，「直接感知是指从看到尼亚加拉瀑布中获得的感知，而不是从看到它的图片中获得的感知。」有时有人认为，在 Gibson 所说的直接感知意义上，感知是准确的。虽然这种说法在某种程度上是对的，但也可能会产生误导。环境是无限丰富的，没有动物能够感知到环境中的大部分。因此，Gibson 说，「随着观察者探索环境，感知变得更广泛、更精细、更深入、更丰富和更完整。」所谓「接触」或「意识到」，是指能够根据感知来指导自己的活动，制定目标并实现它们。

在第十四章的「想象与感知之间的关系」部分，Gibson 列出了几种用于测试现实感知的方法。这些方法对于理解他对光学结构真实性的观点非常重要。Gibson 通过展示图像的光学结构与现实世界中实在且持久的表面光学结构之间的差异来进行说明。首先，考虑哺乳动物眼睛的镜头调节。镜头调节能让真实表面的纹理变得清晰，但对图像无效。其次，凝视某个表面会使其变得更清晰。第三，表面可以被扫描（图像则不能）。第四，可以仔细检查一个物体。实际上，Gibson 说：「对现实最具决定性的测试是你是否能够通过仔细检查发现新的特征和细节。你能否从中获得新的刺激并提取新的信息？信息是否取之不尽？是否有更多可以观察到的东西？对虚构实体的虚拟检查无法通过这个测试。」他补充道：「另一个判断事物存在的标准是可逆遮挡。任何随着你头部移动而消失并在你移回时重新出现的东西，都是一个持久存在的表面。」

因此，对于由实在表面构成的环境的感知，可以是直接的，因为这种变化及其相关的不变性与任何不真实的东西是截然不同的。

我对这本书的最后一个评论是它与研究发现的密切联系。第 9、10 和 11 章专门回顾了相关的研究成果。由于 Gibson 提出了一个广泛而全面的理论，一些评论者有时忽视了他对研究结果的重视。Gibson 经常表示，他的想法是基于他试图理解的研究发现而提出或修改的。一个很好的例子是棱镜研究。Gibson 总是面临解释 Stratton 和 Ivo Kohler 等人的研究结果的挑战，这些研究者的被试在数小时、数天甚至数周的时间内适应了非同寻常的光学变换。Stratton 的装置让人们看到一个颠倒的世界。许多心理学家从这些研究中看到了大脑的可塑性，而 Gibson 则在思考棱镜佩戴者究竟在适应什么。他在某种抽象层次上意识到，环境的稳定性信息一直存在。因此，Gibson 强调的不是眼-脑-身体系统的可塑性，而是世界的某些真实性质，使得知觉系统能够达到平衡。我建议读者重视那些关于实验的章节，因为它们对 Gibson 来说非常重要。

What happened after the 1979 book was published?

First Reviews

Even though there were groups of people studying Gibson's ideas seriously by 1979, there were not all that many. That did not affect Gibson very much, of course. Serious perception scholars knew about him and his work, but even in his area, few examined his work carefully, and professional journals were as likely as not to ask that authors remove the theory discussion when Gibson- inspired research was submitted for publication. Given that, the first major review of the book, by Frank Restle, was rather surprising because Restle had no special connection to Gibson's ideas or research. Nevertheless, he seemed to appreciate the promise that was there and dubbed Gibson the "Seer of Ithaca."

Restle (1980)caught much of the significance of the book rather nicely here, "The main body of perceptual research bears little, if at all, on how a moving person or animal uses vision. If vision research were assigned the job of helping design a suitable prosthesis for the blind, or buildings that help visitors find their way, or highways and roads that lead drivers to their destinations and away from accidents, or machines that are easy to use, Gibson's thinking would at once be seen to be relevant, practical, and highly advanced. Vision research limited to perception of gratings, color patches, block letters, and bad line drawings would seem to be of little value"(p. 293).

Ralph Norman (1980)wrote the review of Gibson's book in Science. He praised the analysis of the environment and the real world emphasis in the book, but thought that the process of pickup is missing, claiming that Gibson thinks optical structure is automatically picked up if it's there. This has been a common complaint. Gibson rarely did anything to ameliorate such misunder- standings (to the extent that they are misunderstandings). The question of psychological process has to be backed up more than Haber acknowledged, however. That is, a person asking for a psychological processing account needs to consider that goal such a process is meant to perform. Gibson thought that in the end, even though not always admitting it, what people wanted was a "mechanism"to convert a sensation to a perception, and for him, there was no such job to be done. This is so because perceiving involves the detection of information that specifies functionally meaningful properties of the environment (affordances), rather than the conversion of meaningless sensations into a meaningful percept.

1979 年这本书出版后发生了什么？

第一次评论

尽管到 1979 年，已经有一些人在认真研究 Gibson 的思想，但人数并不多。当然，这对 Gibson 影响不大。严肃的感知学者了解他和他的工作，但即使在他的领域内，仔细研究他作品的人也不多，专业期刊甚至可能会要求作者在投稿时删除与 Gibson 理论相关的讨论。因此，Frank Restle 对这本书的首次重要评论相当令人惊讶，因为 Restle 并没有特别关注 Gibson 的思想或研究。然而，他似乎看到了其中的潜力，并称 Gibson 为「伊萨卡的先知」。

Restle（1980）很好地捕捉到了这本书的重要性，「大多数感知研究几乎没有涉及一个移动的人或动物如何使用视觉。如果视觉研究的任务是帮助设计适合盲人的假肢、帮助访客找到路的建筑、引导司机到达目的地并避免事故的公路，或者设计易于使用的机器，那么 Gibson 的思想将立即显得相关、实用且高度先进。仅限于研究条纹、色块、方块字母和糟糕线条图的感知研究似乎没有多大价值」（第 293 页）。

Ralph Norman（1980）在《Science》杂志上撰写了对 Gibson 书籍的评论。他赞扬了书中对环境和现实世界的分析，但批评书中缺少对信息获取过程的描述。他声称 Gibson 认为只要光学结构存在，人们就能自动获取。这种批评是常见的。Gibson 很少采取措施来缓解这些误解（如果它们真的是误解的话）。心理过程的问题需要比 Haber 所说的更详细的支持。也就是说，提出心理处理需求的人需要考虑这种处理过程的目标。Gibson 认为，尽管他并不总是承认，人们真正想要的是一种将感觉转换为知觉的「机制」，而他认为这种机制根本不存在。因为在他看来，知觉是通过检测环境中功能性有意义的属性（affordances）来实现的，而不是将无意义的感觉转换为有意义的知觉。

Subsequent Ripples Through the Scholarly World

Cornell Ph.D.'s, Herbert and Anne Pick, had brought knowledge of Gibson to the University of Minnesota even before publication of Gibson's 1966 book. They invited both Gibsons for visits to Minnesota. This exposure led Robert Shaw to go to Cornell for a year in 1970, at the same time as David N. Lee was visiting. Shaw returned to Minnesota to develop his Gibson-inspired studies and Lee went to the University of Edinburgh. In 1975, Shaw joined Michael Turvey at the University of Connecticut. See Shaw (2002) for some autobio- graphy, and Reed (1988) for a description of the spread of Gibson's influence. Alan Costall in the UK and Harry Heft in the U.S. were inspired by the implic- ations of Gibson's work as it applied to the social, cultural and developmental spheres.

In 1980 and 1981, major critiques of Gibson's claims about direct perception appeared: Ullman (1980)and Fodor Pylyshyn (1981). The Ullman critique appeared in Behavioral and Brain Sciences and therefore was answered by various commentators at the time. Turvey, Shaw, Reed Mace (1981) answered Fodor and Pylyshyn in the following issue of Cognition. Claire Michaels and Claudia Carello (1981) gave the title, Direct Perception to their popular account of Gibson's ideas.

A decade, and then two, after 1979, enough time had passed for there to be several book length studies of Gibson's ideas-Lombardo (1987) described Gibson's ideas in the context of a comprehensive history of the study of vision, Reed (1988) provided an authoritative intellectual biography of Gibson, and Heft (2001)focused on understanding Gibson through the lens of the radical empiricism of William James.

There is an International Society for Ecological Psychology which has met every two years since 1981. It has fostered the development of a world-wide community of researchers who visit one another's labs and often share students. The professional journal, Ecological Psychology, has been publishing for more than 25 years. Articles with Gibsonian concepts at their core are now published not only throughout experimental psychology, but also in social, develop- mental, and applied psychology as well as a wider range of fields to be mentioned below. This is not to say that Gibson's ideas dominate any part of mainstream psychology, but they seep in occasionally. See Szokolszky (2013) for Ulric Neisser's assessment in 1997.

Without question, Gibson's widest impact has been through his concept of "affordance." He had already identified relational properties, in the case of occluding edge phenomena, and he here explores a second class of such prop- erties that are "neither objective nor subjective."For example, in order to loco- mote, animals need a stable supporting surface. Where such surfaces exist, the surfaces can be said to support locomotion by the appropriate animals. 'Supportability"exists by virtue both of the material nature and arrangement of environmental surfaces as well as the size and capability of specific animals. That is, the surface affords locomotion relative to a specific animal. For example, the surface of water affords locomotion to spiders of the dolomedes genus but not to humans. Likewise, "graspability"exists by virtue of animals with limbs that can grasp and environmental surfaces of a size, shape, and rigidity that allow grasping. These entities "point both ways"-to the "objective"environ- ment and to the "subject" animal. They are real, well-defined, and not spooky in a subjective mentalistic sense; but not objective in the common sense view of the physical world either. Since 1979, the concept of affordance has "gone viral," to use internet jargon. This is largely attributable to the promotion of Donald Norman (1988) whose work has been influential in the interactive design (computers) community. Norman somewhat skewed the meaning of affordance, but he and other writers about design and human factors have offered clarifications and are quick to acknowledge Gibson's priority as well as their own departures from his original meaning.

Soon after the publication of The Ecological Approach, it was common for people to wonder how one would do research on affordances. That question was answered with a steady stream of research. William H. Warren, Ir. (1984) conducted an elegant set of studies on stair climbing-the perception of"climb- ability"and the measurement of actual "climbability"by tall people compared to short people. Interestingly, the maxmium step height that was judged to by climb-on-able 50% of the time for both groups corresponded to the same rela- tional value (the ratio of leg length to step riser height). This finding points to specifiable and perceivable relational property scaled relative to the individual perceiver. This research led to a very large number of studies in many labs. Karen Adolph, a student of Eleanor J. Gibson's, James Gibson's equally famous- wife, followed up her mentor's well known work with babies on a "visual cliff." Adolph has now made numerous important contributions to our understanding of the development of infant locomotion and the perception of affordances (e.g., Adolph Kretch, 2012).

Another important contribution stemming from Gibson's earlier work is that of David N. Lee (see Pepping Grealy, 2007)who used his mathematical quantities, tau and tau dot, to guide much research on the perceptual guidance of movement. Tau captures time-to-collision'by a moving perceiver, and it is another "higher order,"relation originating in the Gibson program.

Given that Gibson began his core enterprise working on the practical prob- lems of flying airplanes, it should not be surprising that his work frequently has been embraced by people working in "applied"areas. The division between oure science and applied science is pervasive. As pure theory about real settings. Gibson's work has proven to be uniquely situated to cut across both domains. Also, considering his writings on art, including exchanges with friend the art historian, E. H. Gombrich, it should not be surprising that many people in both the scholarship and practice of visual arts have shown an interest in Gibson. Gibson's student, John M. Kennedy, pursued research on pictures, and drawing in the blind. at Harvard (where he had contact with rudolf Arnheim) and then Scarborough College at Toronto. Finally, given that perception is a staple of philosophy, and that Gibson claimed to have something to say about ontology as well as epistemology (and phenomenology), it is not surprising to find philosophers studying Gibson.

Some of the other influences and alliances were not as easy to foresee in 1979. Gibson's stress on the fundamental nature of motor activity in perceiving (one must perceive in order to act and act in order to perceive)has led to many connections to human movement researchers. The Russian researcher. Nikolai Bernstein (see Latash Turvev. 1996). studied skilled movement in ways that were compatible with Gibson. The book series, Resources for Ecological Psychology, was dedicated jointly to Gibson and Bernstein. Accordingly, Gibson is studied in some quarters of kinesiology, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.

Also, over the past 15 years, significant alliances have been developed between ecological psychologists and dynamical systems theorists and researchers. Especially noteworthy here are the contributions of Esther Thelen and her colleagues to the development of perception, action, and cognition.

The following list mentions names in order to avoid being too vague. With internet search engines, information about any of them should be easy to find. While I think this is good for the sake of clarity, it is dangerous from the stand- point of omission. Important people will be left out. Here, then, are areas (with example people)that have found Gibson's work of interest: Within psychology, I've already mentioned the developmental psychology of Karen Adolph. Then there is social psychology (Reuben Baron, Leslie Zebrowitz, Kerry Marsh). psychology of language (Carol Fowler) organizational psychology (Fred and Merrelyn Emery), and environmental psychology (Harry Heft). Beyond psycho- logy I can list anthropology (Tim Ingold), archeology (David L. Webster at Durham. UK). architecture (Arakawa. Madeline Gins. Michael Benedikt).

complex systems (Scott Kelso, Arthur Iberall), design (Naoto Fukasawa), etho- logy (Gilbert Gottlieb followers), film (Joe Anderson, Barbara Anderson, David Bordwell), musical performance (Marilyn Nonken), musical appreciation (Eric Clarke, Oxford, UK), philosophy (John Searle, Jack Sanders, Ruth Millikan), and sociology (Ian Hutchby, UK). See, I told you someone would be left out.

Gibson's work has stirred the pot in many scholarly disciplines. The mix has not even begun to settle. Hence this work should repay continued attention for years to come. Isn't that what a classic should do?

学术界的后续影响

在 Gibson 的书于 1966 年出版之前，Cornell 大学的博士 Herbert 和 Anne Pick 已经将 Gibson 的理论带到了明尼苏达大学。他们邀请了 Gibson 夫妇访问明尼苏达。这次访问促使 Robert Shaw 在 1970 年去了 Cornell 大学待了一年，与此同时，David N. Lee 也在访学。Shaw 回到明尼苏达后继续进行受 Gibson 启发的研究，而 Lee 则去了爱丁堡大学。1975 年，Shaw 加入了康涅狄格大学的 Michael Turvey。可以参见 Shaw（2002）的自传和 Reed（1988）对 Gibson 影响传播的描述。Alan Costall 在英国和 Harry Heft 在美国从 Gibson 的理论中获得了对社会、文化和发展领域应用的启发。

1980 年和 1981 年，Gibson 关于直接感知的主张受到了主要批评：Ullman（1980）和 Fodor Pylyshyn（1981)。Ullman 的批评发表在《行为与脑科学》上，因此当时得到了各种评论员的回应。Turvey、Shaw、Reed 和 Mace（1981）在《认知》的下一期中回应了 Fodor 和 Pylyshyn。Claire Michaels 和 Claudia Carello（1981）将他们对 Gibson 思想的通俗解释命名为《直接感知》。

1979 年之后的十年到二十年间，已经有足够的时间来出版几本关于 Gibson 思想的专著 ——Lombardo（1987）在全面描述视觉研究历史的背景下介绍了 Gibson 的思想，Reed（1988）提供了 Gibson 的权威智力传记，而 Heft（2001）则从威廉·詹姆斯的激进经验主义视角来解读 Gibson。

自 1981 年以来，每两年召开一次的国际生态心理学会促进了全球研究者社区的发展，研究者们互访实验室并经常共享学生。专业期刊《生态心理学》已出版超过 25 年。以 Gibsonian 概念为核心的文章现在不仅在实验心理学中发表，还在社会、发展和应用心理学以及其他更广泛的领域中出现。这并不是说 Gibson 的思想在主流心理学中占据主导地位，但它们偶尔会渗透进来。参见 Szokolszky（2013）对 Ulric Neisser 在 1997 年的评估。

毫无疑问，Gibson 对学术界最大的影响是通过他的「可供性（affordance)」概念。他曾在研究遮蔽边缘现象时识别出了一种关系属性，这次他探讨了另一类「既非客观也非主观」的属性。例如，为了移动，动物需要一个稳定的支撑面。如果存在这样的表面，可以说这些表面支持适当的动物移动。「可支持性」既取决于环境表面的材料性质和排列，又取决于特定动物的大小和能力。也就是说，表面相对于特定动物提供了移动的可能性。例如，水面可以让属于 dolomedes 属的蜘蛛在上面移动，但人类却无法在上面移动。同样，「可抓性」取决于动物是否有可以抓握的肢体，以及环境表面的大小、形状和刚性是否允许抓握。这些属性既指向「客观」的环境，又指向「主观」的动物。它们是真实且定义明确的，并非主观心理学意义上的神秘存在；但也不是物理世界常识中的客观存在。自 1979 年以来，「可供性」概念已经像病毒一样传播开来。这在很大程度上归功于 Donald Norman（1988）的推广，他的工作在交互设计（computers）社区中产生了很大的影响。尽管 Norman 对「可供性」的含义进行了某些修改，但他和其他关于设计和人类因素的作者也进行了澄清，并迅速承认了 Gibson 的优先权以及他们自己对其原意的偏离。

在《生态学方法》发表后不久，人们常常好奇如何进行可供性（affordances）的研究。这个问题通过一系列持续的研究得到了回答。William H. Warren, Jr.（1984）进行了关于楼梯攀爬的优雅研究 —— 研究了「可攀爬性」的感知以及高个子和矮个子实际「可攀爬性」的测量。有趣的是，对于这两组人来说，被判断为 50% 时间可攀爬的最大台阶高度与相同的关系值（腿长与台阶高度的比例）一致。这一发现表明，相对于个体感知者，可以明确和感知的关系属性。这项研究在许多实验室中引发了大量后续研究。Eleanor J. Gibson 的学生 Karen Adolph 跟进了她导师关于婴儿「视觉悬崖」的著名研究。Adolph 现在对我们理解婴儿运动发育和可供性的感知做出了许多重要贡献（例如，Adolph Kretch, 2012）。

另一个源于 Gibson 早期工作的重大贡献来自 David N. Lee（参见 Pepping Grealy, 2007）的研究，他利用自己的数学量 tau 和 tau dot 来指导大量关于运动感知引导的研究。Tau 表示移动感知者的「碰撞时间」，这是 Gibson 计划中另一个「高阶」关系。

鉴于 Gibson 的核心工作是解决飞机飞行中的实际问题，他的研究成果被应用领域的研究人员广泛接受也就不足为奇了。纯科学和应用科学之间的划分是普遍存在的，而 Gibson 的理论能够跨越这两个领域。此外，考虑到他在艺术方面的著作，包括与他的朋友、艺术史学家 E. H. Gombrich 的交流，因此，许多从事视觉艺术研究和实践的人对 Gibson 表现出了兴趣。Gibson 的学生 John M. Kennedy 曾在哈佛大学（在那里他与 Rudolf Arnheim 有接触）和多伦多的 Scarborough 学院研究图片和盲人绘画。最后，由于知觉是哲学中的一个重要主题，而 Gibson 也声称对本体论、认识论（和现象学）有独到见解，哲学家们研究 Gibson 也就不足为奇了。

1979 年，一些其他的影响和联盟并不那么容易预见。Gibson 强调运动在知觉中的基本作用（必须感知才能行动，必须行动才能感知）导致了他与人类运动研究人员之间的许多联系。俄罗斯研究员 Nikolai Bernstein（参见 Latash Turvev, 1996）以与 Gibson 理论兼容的方式研究技能运动。书籍系列《生态心理学资源》共同献给 Gibson 和 Bernstein。因此，Gibson 的研究在运动学、物理治疗和职业治疗的某些领域中也得到了关注。

此外，在过去的 15 年中，生态心理学家与动态系统理论家和研究人员之间建立了重要的联盟。尤其值得注意的是 Esther Thelen 及其同事在知觉、行动和认知发展方面的贡献。

以下列表中提到了一些名字，以避免内容过于笼统。通过互联网搜索引擎，可以轻松找到他们的相关信息。尽管这有助于更清晰地理解，但也有遗漏的风险，一些重要人物可能没有被提到。因此，这里列出了一些对 Gibson 的作品感兴趣的领域及示例人物：在心理学领域，有 Karen Adolph 的发展心理学，还有社会心理学（Reuben Baron，Leslie Zebrowitz，Kerry Marsh），语言心理学（Carol Fowler），组织心理学（Fred 和 Merrelyn Emery），以及环境心理学（Harry Heft）。在心理学之外，还有人类学（Tim Ingold），考古学（David L. Webster，英国杜伦大学），建筑学（Arakawa，Madeline Gins，Michael Benedikt）。

其他领域包括复杂系统（Scott Kelso，Arthur Iberall），设计（Naoto Fukasawa），动物行为学（Gilbert Gottlieb 的追随者），电影（Joe Anderson，Barbara Anderson，David Bordwell），音乐表演（Marilyn Nonken），音乐欣赏（Eric Clarke，英国牛津大学），哲学（John Searle，Jack Sanders，Ruth Millikan），以及社会学（Ian Hutchby，英国）。如我所说，还是会有一些人被遗漏。

Gibson 的作品在许多学术领域引起了热烈讨论。这种影响还远未平息。因此，这项工作在未来几年内仍将值得关注。这不正是经典作品的特质吗？

## Conclusion

In the first pages of this book, I promised to give an account of natural vision, not just snapshot vision but vision that is ambient and ambulatory. Ambient vision is what you get from looking around at the scenery. Ambulatory vision is what you get from walking through the countryside.

The standard approach to vision begins with the eye fixed and exposed to a momentary pattern of stimuli. It then goes on to consider vision with the head fixed and the eye allowed to explore the pattern by scanning it, that is, by looking at parts in succession. Each fixation is a glimpse of the pattern comparable to a momentary exposure and is thus supposed to be analogous to a photographic snapshot taken by a camera with a shutter. Each successive snapshot is assumed to be transmitted to the brain. The result of all this is aperture vision, a sequence of snapshots.

The standard approach never gets around to ambient vision with head turning, and it does not even consider ambulatory vision. The. process of perception is supposed to be localized in the head, not in the muscles, and it begins after the sensory input reaches the visual projection area of the cerebral cortex. The mind is in the brain.

The ecological approach to visual perception works from the opposite end. It begins with the flowing array of the observer who walks from one vista to another, moves around an object of interest, and can approach it for scrutiny, thus extracting the invariants that underlie the changing perspective structure and seeing the connections between hidden and unhidden surfaces. This approach next considers the fact of ambient awareness and explains it by the invariance of the sliding samples of the 360° array. Only then is the awareness of a single scene considered, the surfaces seen with the head fixed and the array frozen. The classical puzzles that arise with this kind of vision are resolved by recognizing that the invariants are weaker and the ambiguities stronger when the point of observation is motionless. Finally, the kind of visual awareness obtained with the eye fixed and the retina either briefly exposed or made to stay fixed is considered for what it is, a peculiar result of trying to make the eye work as if it were a camera at the end of a nerve cable. The visual system continues to operate at this photographic level, but the constraints imposed on it are so severe that very little information can be picked up. The level is that of cellular physiology, the photochemistry of retinal cells, the anatomy of the nerves and tracts, and the firing of nerve impulses.

The artificially produced glimpse is an abnormal kind of vision, not the simplest kind on which normal vision is based. It is a poor sort of awarenesss. But it has seemed to be fundamental for hitherto persuasive reasons: it results from an image; it comes from a stimulus; it is a sensory input; it is what the nerve transmits. But if this is so, how could the series of glimpses be integrated? How could the sequence, as I put it, be converted into a scene?

If perception of the environment is truly based on glimpses, it has to be a process of construction. If the data are insufficient, the observer must go beyond the data. How? Some of the greatest minds in history have undertaken to answer this question without success.

I suggested in Chapter 14 that explanations of perception based on sensory inputs fail because they all come down to this: In order to perceive the world, one must already have ideas about it. Knowledge of the world is explained by assuming that knowledge of the world exists. Whether the ideas are learned or innate makes no difference; the fallacy lies in the circular reasoning.

But if, on other hand, perception of the environment is not based on a sequence of snapshots but on invariant-extraction from a flux, one does not need to have ideas about the environment in order to perceive it. Another puzzle is resolved at the same time, the awareness of oneself in the environ- ment. The young child does not need to have ideas of space in order to see the surfaces around him; he need pay no attention to the cues for depth if he can see the layout: he need not compensate for the small retinal image of a distant surface if he never notices the image but only extracts the invariant.

Such is the ecological approach to perception. It promises to simplify psycho- logy by making old puzzles disappear. Especially do all the genuinely mischief- making puzzles connected with the concept of an image become irrelevant. How can one see an upright world with an inverted retinal image? Why doesn't the object change when its retinal image is transposed over the retina? Where is the little man who looks at the image? If the two eyes yield a double image of a single object under some conditions, why not under all?

The very notion of an image as a flattened-out object, a sort of pancake of a solid body, is shown to be misleading. It begins to appear that most of what has been written about pictures and images over the centuries is misleading, or hopelessly vague. We should forget it all and start fresh. The information for the perception of an object is not its image. The information in light to specify something does not have to resemble it, or copy it, or be a simulacrum or even an exact projection. Nothing is copied in the light to the eye of an observer, not the shape of a thing, not the surface of it, not its substance, not its color, and certainly not its motion. But all these things are specified in the light.

What is the future of this approach? It needs to be tested experimentally, it needs to be clarified further, and its implications need to be followed up. It already has adherents, and their work is beginning to appear. Robert Shaw has been thinking along the same lines for some time, and he is developing the theory of invariants (Shaw and McIntyre, 1974) and the implications for epistemology (Shaw and Bransford, 1977). William Mace has been expounding and elaborating the approach (Mace, 1974，1977). Michael Turvey has been considering how to unify visual perception and action (Turvey, 1977). David Lee has been experimenting with visual kinesthesis (Lishman and Lee, 1973; Lee, 1974), and so has Rik Warren (1976). Above all, Eleanor Gibson has published a treatise on the development of perception from an ecological point of view (1969) and is carrying out experiments with infants on their discrim- ination of optical transformations (1978). Even the leading exponent of cognitive psychology, Ulric Neisser, has been sufficiently impressed with the advantages of this approach to describe it sympathetically in his new book (Neisser, 1976).

Nevertheless, as I pointed out in the Introduction, experimental studies that display optical information are not so easy to perform as the old-fashioned experiments that expose a stimulus to a fixed eye. The experimenter cannot simply apply a stimulus that he varies systematically, the "independent variable" of the scientific experiment. Instead, he must make available an optical invariant that he expects will specify something about the world on grounds of ecological optics. This takes ingenuity. Only a few experimenters have learned to do it as yet. But it can be done.

The experimenter should not hope, and does not need, to display all the information in an ambient optic array, let alone all the information in a trans- forming ambient optic array. He is not trying to simulate reality. He could not create the illusion of looking around and walking through the countryside in any case, for he would have to create the countryside. He should not want to deceive the observer. The observer who begins to be fooled should be allowed to make the standard tests for reality, such as getting up and looking behind the screen of the display. The information for a certain dimension of perception or proprioception can be displayed without interference from the accompanying information to specify the display. That is the lesson of research on pictures and motion pictures. What is required is only that the essential invariant be isolated and set forth.

The experimental psychologist should realize that he cannot truly control the perception of an observer, for the reason that it is not caused by stimuli. Only snapshot vision is triggered so that it can be touched off by imposing a stimulus on the receptor, and even then one has to have the agreement of the subject to look into the tachistoscope. Perception cannot be studied by the so-called psychophysical experiment if that refers to physical stimuli and corresponding mental sensations. The theory of psychophysical parallelism that assumes that the dimensions of consciousness are in correspondence with the dimensions of physics and that the equations of such correspondence can be established is an expression of Cartesian dualism. Perceivers are not aware of the dimensions of physics. They are aware of the dimensions of the information in the flowing array of stimulation that are relevant to their lives.

在这本书的前几页，我承诺要讲述自然视觉，不仅仅是快照式的视觉，还包括环境视觉和步行视觉。环境视觉是指你环顾四周时所看到的风景。步行视觉是指你在乡间漫步时所体验到的视觉。

标准的视觉研究方法是从眼睛固定并暴露于瞬间的刺激开始。接下来，它会考虑在头部固定的情况下，眼睛通过扫描来探索图案，也就是依次查看图案的各个部分。每次固定都是对图案的一瞥，类似于相机快门拍摄的瞬间曝光，因此类似于快照。假设每个连续的快照都被传送到大脑。所有这些形成了孔视力，即一系列快照。

标准方法从未涉及到随着头部转动的环境视觉，甚至不考虑步行视觉。感知过程被认为是局限在头部，而不是在肌肉中，并且在感官输入到达大脑皮层的视觉投射区之后才开始。心智在大脑中。

生态视觉感知的方法是从反方向开始的。它从观察者的流动视野开始，观察者从一个视角走到另一个视角，围绕感兴趣的物体移动，并靠近物体进行仔细观察，从而提取出在变化的视角结构下的恒定因素，并看到隐藏和未隐藏表面之间的联系。接下来，这种方法考虑到环境感知，并通过解释 360° 视野中滑动样本的恒定性来说明这一点。只有在这种情况下，才会考虑单一场景的感知，即在头部固定和视野冻结的情况下看到的表面。通过认识到当观察点静止时，恒定性较弱、模糊性较强，可以解决这种视觉方式下出现的经典难题。最后，考虑到固定眼睛和短暂暴露或保持固定的视网膜获得的视觉感知，这实际上是试图让眼睛像一个连接在神经末端的相机那样工作的奇特结果。视觉系统继续在这种「摄影」模式下运作，但由于受到极大限制，能获取的信息非常少。这一级别涉及细胞生理学、视网膜细胞的光化学、神经和神经通路的解剖学以及神经冲动的传递。

这种人为产生的短暂视野是一种异常的视觉方式，而不是正常视觉所依赖的最基本形式。这是一种较差的感知。但是，由于一些长期以来被认为有说服力的原因，它似乎是基本的：它来源于图像；它是由刺激引起的；它是一种感觉输入；它是神经传递的内容。但是，如果是这样，如何将一系列的短暂视野整合起来呢？如何将这些片段转化为一个完整的场景？

如果对环境的感知确实是基于片段的，那么这个过程必然是构建性的。如果数据不足，观察者必须超越这些数据。如何超越？历史上一些最伟大的头脑都曾试图回答这个问题，但都未能成功。

我在第 14 章中提到，基于感觉输入的感知解释之所以失败，是因为它们都归结为一个问题：要感知世界，一个人必须已经对世界有了某种看法。对世界的知识被解释为已经存在的知识。无论这些想法是通过学习得来的还是天生的，这种循环推理都是谬误。

但如果对环境的感知不是基于一系列的快照，而是从持续变化中提取不变性，那么一个人不需要对环境有任何预设的看法也能感知它。同时，另一个问题也得到了回答：个体对自己在环境中的意识。小孩子不需要有空间的概念就能看到周围的表面；如果他能够看到整体布局，就不需要关注深度线索；如果他不关注视网膜上的图像，而只是提取不变性，就不需要为远处物体的小视网膜图像进行补偿。

这就是生态感知方法。它有望通过消除旧谜题来简化心理学。特别是那些与图像概念相关的难题变得不再重要。如何用倒置的视网膜图像看到正立的世界？为什么物体的视网膜图像在视网膜上移位时，物体不会改变？谁在看这些图像？为什么在某些条件下两只眼睛看到的单个物体会产生双重图像，而不是在所有条件下？

认为图像是一个平面化的物体，就像一个固体的煎饼，这种概念实际上是误导性的。几百年来，关于图像和照片的许多论述都是不准确的，甚至是模糊不清的。我们应该抛开这些旧观念，重新出发。感知物体所需的信息并不是它的图像。光中的信息用来指示某物，不需要与它相似，不需要复制它，也不需要成为它的模拟或精确投影。观察者的眼睛并没有在光中复制任何东西，无论是物体的形状、表面、物质、颜色，还是运动，但所有这些信息都在光中得到了体现。

这种新方法的未来如何？它需要通过实验来验证，需要进一步澄清其理论，并且需要研究其影响。目前已经有一些支持者在进行相关工作。Robert Shaw 一直在研究不变理论（Shaw and McIntyre, 1974）及其对认识论的影响（Shaw and Bransford, 1977)。William Mace 也在详细阐述这种方法（Mace, 1974，1977)。Michael Turvey 正在研究如何统一视觉感知和行动（Turvey, 1977)。David Lee 和 Rik Warren 分别在进行视觉动觉方面的实验（Lishman and Lee, 1973; Lee, 1974; Warren, 1976)。最重要的是，Eleanor Gibson 发表了一篇关于从生态角度研究感知发展的论著（1969)，并且正在进行婴儿对光学变形辨别的实验（1978)。甚至认知心理学的主要代表 Ulric Neisser 也在他的新书中提到并支持这种方法（Neisser, 1976)。

尽管如此，如我在介绍中提到的，显示光学信息的实验并不像传统的固定视角实验那样容易进行。实验者不能简单地应用系统变化的刺激作为「独立变量」。相反，他需要提供一种光学不变量，希望这种不变量能根据生态光学解释世界。这需要一定的创造力。目前，只有少数实验者能做到这一点，但这是可行的。

实验者不需要，也不应期望展示环境光学阵列中的所有信息，更不用说变换后的环境光学阵列中的所有信息了。他并不是在模拟现实。即使他想，也无法创造出环顾四周和穿越乡村的幻觉，因为这需要实际创造出乡村。他不应该试图欺骗观察者。观察者若感到被愚弄，应允许他们进行现实测试，例如起身查看显示屏幕后面。某些感知或本体感觉维度的信息可以在不干扰其他信息的情况下显示。这是图片和电影研究的经验教训。关键是要将核心的不变量隔离并展示出来。

实验心理学家应该明白，他无法真正控制观察者的感知，因为感知并不是由刺激引起的。只有快照视觉是通过在感受器上施加刺激来触发的，而且这还需要受试者同意使用速示器。如果所谓的心理物理实验指的是物理刺激和相应的心理感觉，那么这种实验无法研究感知。假设意识的维度与物理维度相对应，并且这种对应关系可以通过方程来描述的心理物理平行理论，其实是笛卡尔二元论的表达。感知者并未意识到物理的维度。他们意识到的是与自己生活相关的刺激流中的信息维度。
