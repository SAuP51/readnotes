THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

STIMULATION AND STIMULUS

INFORMATION

Having described the environment, I shall now describe the information avail- able to observers for perceiving the environment. Only then will we be prepared to consider how they perceive, what the activity of perception consists of, and how they can control behavior in the environment.

For visual perception, the information is obviously in light. But the term light means different things in different sciences, and we shall have to sort out the different meanings to avoid confusion. Most of us are confused, including the scientists themselves. The science of light is called optics. But the science of vision is also called optics, and the textbooks are not at all clear about the differ- ence. Let us try to distinguish light as physical energy, light as a stimulus for vision, and light as information for perception.

What I call ecological optics is concerned with the available information for perception and differs from physical optics, from geometrical optics, and also from physiological optics. Ecological optics cuts across the boundaries of these existing disciplines, borrowing from all but going beyond them.

Ecological optics rests on several distinctions that are not basic in physical optics: the distinction between luminous bodies and nonluminous bodies; the difference between light as radiation and light as illumination; and the differ- ence between radiant light, propagating outward from a source, and ambient light, coming to a point in a medium where an eye might be stationed. Since these differences are fundamental, they should be stated at the beginning. Why they are so important will become clear. 42 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The Distinction Between Luminous and Illuminated Bodies

Some material bodies emit light, and others do not. Light comes from sources such as the sun in the sky and from other sources close at hand such as fires or lamps on the earth. They "give" light, as we say, whereas ordinary objects do not. Nonluminous objects only reflect some part of the light that falls on them from a source. And yet we can see the nonluminous bodies along with the luminous ones. In fact, most of the things that need to be seen are nonluminous; they are only seen "by the light of" the source. The question is, how are they seen? For they do not stimulate the eye with light in the same way that luminous bodies do. The intermediate case of luminescent bodies is exceptional.

A terrestrial surface that gives light is usually, although not always, distin- guishable from one that does not; it is visibly luminous, as distinct from being visibly illuminated. In physical optics, the case of reflected light is reduced to the re-emission of light by the atoms of the reflecting surface. But in ecological optics, the difference between a luminous and an illuminated surface is crucial. Where a reflecting surface in physical optics is treated as if it were a dense set of tiny luminous bodies, in ecological optics a reflecting surface is treated as if it were a true surface having a texture. There will be more of this later.

The Distinction Between Radiation and lllumination

Radiant energy as studied in physics is propagated through empty space at enormous velocity. Such energy can be treated either as particles or as waves (and this is a great puzzle, even to physicists), but it travels in straight lines, or rays. The paths of photons are straight lines, and the perpendiculars to the wave fronts are straight lines. Moreover, light comes from atoms and returns to atoms. They give off and take in energy in quantal units. Matter and energy interact. There are elegant laws of this radiation, both at the size-level of atoms and on the grand scale of the universe. But at the ecological level of substances, surfaces, and the medium, we need be concerned only with some of these laws, chiefly scattering, reflection, and absorption.

WHY ECOLOGICAL OPTICS?

The term ecological optics first appeared in print in an article with that title

in Vision Research (Gibson, 1961). It seemed to me that the study of light,

over the centuries, had not produced a coherent discipline. The science

of radiant energy in physics, the science of optical instruments, and the

science of the eye were quite different. The textbooks and journals of

optics gave the impression of monolithic authority, but there were deep

contradictions between the assumptions of the various branches of optics. The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information 43

When I discovered that even an occasional physicist recognized these

cracks in the foundations of the optical establishment (Ronchi, 1957),

I ventured to suggest that optics at the level appropriate for perception

should have a new name.

In daylight, part of the radiant light of the sun reaches the earth in parallel rays, but another part is scattered by being transmitted through an atmosphere that is never perfectly transparent. This light is even more thoroughly scattered when it strikes the textured ground, by what can be called scatter reflection. (This is not to be confused with mirror reflection, which is governed by the simple law of equal angles of the incident ray and the reflected ray. Mirror reflection seldom happens, for there are no mirrors on the ground, and even water surfaces, which could act as mirrors, are usually rippled.) The scatter-reflected light is in turn reflected back from the sky. Each new reflection further disperses

the incident rays. The light thus finds its way into shelters that are not open to the sun, or even to the sky. In semienclosed spaces the light continues to bounce back and forth at 186,000 miles per second. It finds its way through chinks and crevices and into caverns, until the energy is finally absorbed. This light can hardly be thought of as radiation now; it is illumination.

Illumination is a fact of higher order than radiation. In physical optics, experimenters try to avoid what they call stray light in the dark room. But in ecological optics, this light that has gone astray is just what interests us.The opticist works with rays of light, rays that diverge in all directions from their source and never converge to a point unless they are focused by a lens. But an organism has to work with light that converges from all directions and, more- over, has different intensities in different directions.

Many-times reflected light in a medium has a number of consequences that, although important for vision, have not been recognized by students of optics. Chief among them is the fact of ambient light, that is, light that surrounds a point, any point, in the space where an observer could be stationed.

The Distinction Between Radiant Light and Ambient Light

Radiation becomes illumination by reverberating between the earth and the sky and between surfaces that face one another. But that term, referring as it does to sound, does not do justice to the unimaginable quickness of the flux or to the uncountable multiplicity of the reflections back and forth or to their unlimited scattering. If the illumination is conceived as a manifold of rays, one can imagine every point on every surface of any environment as radiating rays outward from that point, as physicists do. Every such radiating pencil is completely "dense." One could think of the rays as completely filling the air and think of each point in the air as a point of intersection of rays coming from FIGURE 4.2 Radiant light from a point source and ambient light to a point in the medium.

A creature with eyes is shown at the point in the air, but it need not be occupied. The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information 45 all directions. It would follow that light is ambient at every point. Light would come to every point; it would surround every point; it would be environing at every point. This is one way of conceiving ambient light.

Such an omnidirectional flux of light could not exist in empty space but only in an environment of reflecting surfaces. In any ordinary terrestrial space, the illumination reaches an equilibrium, that is, it achieves what is called a steady state. The input of energy from the sun is just balanced by the absorption of energy at the surfaces. With any change in the source, a new steady state is immediately reached, as when the sun goes down or is hidden by a cloud. No matter how abrupt the rise or fall of intensity of the light coming from a lamp, the rise or fall of illumination in the room is just as abrupt. The system is said to be open rather than closed inasmuch as addition of energy to the airspace and subtraction of energy from it are going on all the time, but the structure of the reverberation remains the same and does not change. What could this structure be? It is possible to conceive a nested set of solid angles at each point in the medium, as distinguished from a dense set of intersecting lines. The set of solid angles would be the same whatever the intensity of illumination might be (there will be more about this later). They are angles of intercept, based on the environment. The flow of energy is relevant to the stimulation of a retina, but the set of solid angles considered as projections is more relevant to stimulus information.

Consider the differences between radiant light and ambient light that have so far been stated or implied. Radiant light causes illumination; ambient light is the result of illumination. Radiant light diverges from an energy source; ambient light converges to a point of observation. Radiant light must consist of an infinitely dense set of rays; ambient light can be thought of as a set of solid angles having a common apex. Radiant light from a point source is not different in different directions; ambient light at a point is different in different direc- tions. Radiant light has no structure; ambient light has structure. Radiant light is propagated; ambient light is not, it is simply there. Radiant light comes from atoms and returns to atoms; ambient light depends upon an environment of surfaces. Radiant light is energy; ambient light can be information.

The Structuring of Ambient Light

Only insofar as ambient light has structure does it specify the environment. I mean by this that the light at the point of observation has to be different in different directions (or there have to be differences in different directions) in order for it to contain any information. The differences are principally differences of intensity. The term that will be used to describe ambient light with structure is an ambient optic array. This implies an arrangement of some sort, that is, a pattern, a texture, or a configuration. The array has to have parts. The ambient light cannot be homogeneous or blank. (See the illustrations in Chapter 5.) 46 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

What would be the limiting case of ambient light without structure? It would arise if the air were filled with such a dense fog that the light could not rever- berate between surfaces but only between the droplets or particles in the medium. The air would then be translucent but not transparent. Multiple reflection would occur only between closely packed microsurfaces, yielding a sort of microillumination of things too small to see. At any point of observation there would be radiation, but without differences in different directions, without transitions or gradations of intensity, there would be no structure and no array. Similarly, homogeneous ambient light would occur inside a translu- cent shell of some strongly diffusing substance that was illuminated from outside. The shell would transmit light but not structure.

In the case of unstructured ambient light, an environment is not specified and no information about an environment is available. Since the light is undif- ferentiated, it cannot be discriminated, and there is no information in any meaning of that term. The ambient light in this respect is no different from ambient darkness. An environment could exist behind the fog or the darkness. or nothing could exist; either alternative is possible. In the case of ambient light that is unstructured in one part and structured in an adjacent part, such as the blue sky above the horizon and the textured region below it, the former speci- fies a void and the latter a surface. Similarly, the homogeneous area between clouds specifies emptiness, and the heterogeneous areas specify clouds.

The structuring of ambient light by surfaces, especially by their pigmentation and their layout, will be described in the next chapter. Chiefly, it is the opaque surfaces of the world that reflect light, but we must also consider the luminous surfaces that emit light and the semitransparent surfaces that transmit light. As far as the evidence goes, we will describe how the light specifies these surfaces, their composition, texture, color, and layout, their gross properties, not their atomic properties. And this specifying of them is useful information about them. Stimulation and Stimulus Information

In order to stimulate a photoreceptor, that is, to excite it and make it "fire," light energy must be absorbed by it, and this energy must exceed a certain char- acteristic amount known as the threshold of the receptor. Energy must be trans- duced, as the physiologist likes to put it, from one form to another. The rule is supposed to hold for each of a whole bank of photoreceptors, such as is found in the retina. Hence, if an eye were to be stationed at some point where there is ambient light, part of the light would enter the pupil, be absorbed, and act as stimulation. If no eye or any other body that absorbs light is stationed at that point, the flying photons in the air (or the wave fronts) would simply pass through the point without interfering with one another. Only potential stimu- lation exists at such a point. Actual stimulation depends on the presence of photoreceptors. The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information 47

Consider an observer with an eye at a point in a fog-filled medium. The receptors in the retina would be stimulated, and there would consequently be impulses in the fibers of the optic nerve. But the light entering the pupil of the eye would not be different in different directions: it would be unfocus- able, and no image could be formed on the retina. There could be no retinal image because the light on the retina would be just as homogeneous as the ambient light outside the eye. The possessor of the eye could not fix it on anything, and the eye would drift aimlessly. He could not look from one item to another, for no items would be present. If he turned the eye, the experience would be just what it was before. If he moved the eye forward in space, nothing in the field of view would change. Nothing he could do would make any difference in what he could experience, with this single exception: if he closed the eye, an experience that he might call brightness would give way to one he might call darkness. He could distinguish between stimulation of his photoreceptors and nonstimulation of them. But as far as perceiving goes, his eye would be just as blind when light entered it as it would be when light did not.

This hypothetical case demonstrates the difference between the retina and the eye, that is, the difference between receptors and a perceptual organ. Receptors are stimulated, whereas an organ is activated. There can be stimulation of a retina by light without any activation of the eye by stimulus information. Actually, the eye is part of a dual organ, one of a pair of mobile eyes, and they are set in a head that can turn, attached to a body that can move from place to place. These organs make a hierarchy and constitute what I have called a perceptual system (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 3). Such a system is never simply stimu- lated but instead can go into activity in the presence of stimulus information. The characteristic activities of the visual system will be described in Chapter 12 of this book.

The distinction between stimulation for receptors and stimulus information for the visual system is crucial for what is to follow. Receptors are passive, elementary, anatomical components of an eye that, in turn, is only an organ of the complete system (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 2). The traditional conception of a sense is almost wholly abandoned in this new approach. Stimulation by light and corresponding sensations of brightness are traditionally supposed to be the basis of visual perception. The inputs of the nerves are supposed to be the data on which the perceptual processes in the brain operate. But I make a quite different assumption, because the evidence suggests that stimuli as such contain no information, that brightness sensations are not elements of perception, and that inputs of the retina are not sensory elements on which the brain operates.

Visual perception can fail not only for lack of stimulation but also for lack of stimulus information. In homogeneous ambient darkness, vision fails for lack of stimulation. In homogeneous ambient light, vision fails for lack of information, even with adequate stimulation and corresponding sensations. 48 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Do we Ever See Light as Such?

The difference between stimulation and stimulus information can be shown in another way, by considering two contradictory assertions: (1) nothing can be seen, properly speaking, but light; and (2)light, properly speaking, can never be seen. At least one of these assertions must be wrong.

Classical optics, comparing the eye to a camera, has taught that nothing can possibly get into the eye but light in the form of rays or wave fronts. The only alternative to this doctrine seemed to be the naive theory that little copies of objects got into the eye. If all that can ever reach the retina is light in this form, then it would follow that all we can ever see is this light. Sensations of light are the fundamental basis of visual perception, the data, or what is given. This line of reasoning has seemed unassailable up to the present. It leads to what I have called the sensation-based theories of perception (Gibson, 1966b). We cannot see surfaces or objects or the environment directly; we only see them indirectly. All we ever see directly is what stimulates the eye, light. The verb to see, prop- erly used, means to have one or more sensations of light.

What about the opposite assertion that we never see light? It may at first sound unreasonable, or perhaps false, but let us examine the statement carefully. Of all the possible things that can be seen, is light one of them?

A single point of light in an otherwise dark field is not "light"; it specifies either a very distant source of light or a very small source, a luminous object. A single instant or "flash" of such a point specifies a brief event at the source, that is, the on and the off. A fire with coals or flames, a lamp with a wick or filament, a sun or a moon-all these are quite specific objects and are so specified; no one sees merely light. What about a luminous field, such as the sky? To me it seems that I see the sky. not the luminosity as such. What about a beam of light in the air? But this is not seeing light, because the beam is only visible if there are illu- minated particles in the medium. The same is true of the shafts of sunlight seen in clouds under certain conditions.

One can perceive a rainbow, to be sure, a spectrum, but even so that is not the seeing of light. Halos, highlights on water, and scintillations of various kinds are all manifestations of light, not light as such. The only way we see illumination, I believe, is by way of that which is illuminated, the surface on which the beam falls, the cloud, or the particles that are lighted. We do not see the light that is in the air, or that fills the air. If all this is correct, it becomes quite reasonable to assert that all we ever see is the environment or facts about the environment, never photons or waves or radiant energy.

What about the sensation of being dazzled by looking at the sun, or the sensation of glare that one gets from looking at glossy surfaces that reflect an intense source? Are these not sensations of light as such, and do we not then see pure physical energy? Even in this case, I would argue that the answer is no; we are perceiving a state of the eye akin to pain, arising from excessive stimulation. The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information

We perceive a fact about the body as distinguished from a fact about the world, the fact of overstimulation but not the light that caused it. And the experien- cing of facts about the body is not the basis of experiencing facts about the world.

If light in the exact sense of the term is never seen as such, it follows that seeing the environment cannot be based on seeing light as such. The stimulation of the receptors in the retina cannot be seen, paradoxical as this may sound. The supposed sensations resulting from this stimulation are not the data for perception. Stimulation may be a necessary condition for seeing, but it is not sufficient. There has to be stimulus information available to the perceptual system, not just stimulation of the receptors.

In ordinary speech we say that vision depends on light, and we do not need to know physics to be able to say it with confidence. All of us, including every child, know what it is like to be "in the dark." We cannot see anything, not even our own bodies. Approaching dangers and collisions ahead cannot be foreseen, and this is, with some reason, alarming. But what we mean when we say that vision depends on light is that it depends on illumination and on sources of illumination. We do not necessarily mean that we have to see light or have sensations of light in order to see anything else.

Just as the stimulation of the receptors in the retina cannot be seen, so the mechanical stimulation of the receptors in the skin cannot be felt, and the stim- ulation of the hair cells in the inner ear cannot be heard. So also the chemical stimulation of the receptors in the tongue cannot be tasted, and the stimulation of the receptors in the nasal membrane cannot be smelled. We do not perceive stimuli.

The Concept of the Stimulus as an Application of Energy

The explicit assumption that only the receptors of observers are stimulated and that their sense organs are not stimulated but activated is in disagreement with what most psychologists take for granted. They blithely use the verb stimulate and the noun stimulus in various ways not consistent with one another. It is convenient and easy to do so, but if the words are slippery and if we allow ourselves to slide from one meaning to another unawares, we are confused without knowing it. I once examined the writings of modern psychology and found eight separate ways in which the use of the term stimulus was equivocal (Gibson, 1960a).

The concept of the stimulus comes from physiology, where it first meant whatever application of energy fires a nerve cell or touches off a receptor or excites a reflex response. It was taken over by psychology, because it seemed that a stimulus explained not only the arousal of a sensation but the arousal of a response, including responses much more elaborate than reflexes. If all behavior consisted of responses to stimuli, it looked as if a truly scientific psychology 50 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

could be founded. This was the stimulus-response formula. It was indeed promising. Both stimuli and responses could be measured. But a great variety of environmental facts had to be called stimuli because a variety of things can be responded to. If anything in the world can be called a stimulus, the concept has got out of hand and its original meaning has been lost. I suggest that we go back to its meaning in physiology. In this book I shall use the term strictly. For I now wish to make the clearest possible contrast between stimulus energy and stimulus information.

Note that a stimulus, strictly speaking in the physiologist's sense, is anything that touches off a receptor or causes a response; it is the effective stimulus, and whatever application of energy touches off the receptor is effective. The photoreceptors in the eye are usually triggered by light but not necessarily; they are also triggered by mechanical or electrical energy. The mechanoreceptors of the skin and the chemoreceptors of the mouth and nose are more or less special- ized for mechanical and chemical energy respectively but not completely so; they are just especially "sensitive" to those kinds of energy. A stimulus in this strict meaning carries no information about its source in the world; that is, it does not specify its source. Only stimulation that comes in a structured array and that changes over time specifies its external source.

Note also that a stimulus, strictly speaking, is temporary. There is nothing lasting about it, as there is about a persisting object of the environment. A stim- ulus must begin and end. If it persists, the response of the receptor tapers off and ceases; the term for this is sensory adaptation. Hence, a permanent object cannot possibly be specified by a stimulus. The stimulus information for an object would have to reside in something persisting during an otherwise changing fHlow of stimulation. And note above all that an object cannot be a stimulus, although current thinking carelessly takes for granted that it is one.

An application of stimulus energy exceeding the threshold can be said to cause a response of the sensory mechanism, and the response is an effect. But the presence of stimulus information cannot be said to cause perception. Perception is not a response to a stimulus but an act of information pickup. Perception may or may not occur in the presence of information. Perceptual awareness, unlike sensory awareness, does not have any discoverable stimulus threshold. It depends on the age of the perceiver, how well he has learned to perceive, and how strongly he is motivated to perceive. If perceptions are based on sensations and sensations have thresholds, then perceptions should have thresholds. But they do not, and the reason for this, I believe, is that perceptions are not based on sensations. There are magnitudes for applied stimuli above which sensations occur and below which they do not. But there is no magnitude of information above which perceiving occurs and below which it does not.

When stimulus energy is transformed into nervous impulses, they are said to be transmitted to the brain. But stimulus information is not anything that could possibly be sent up a nerve bundle and delivered to the brain, inasmuch as it has The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information 51 to be isolated and extracted from the ambient energy. Information as here conceived is not transmitted or conveyed, does not consist of signals or messages, and does not entail a sender and a receiver. This will be elaborated later.

When a small packet of stimulus energy is absorbed by a receptor, what is lost to the environment is gained by the living cells. The amount of energy may be as low as a few quanta, but nevertheless energy is conserved. In contrast to this fact, stimulus information is not lost from the environment when it is gained by the observer. There is no such thing as conservation of information. It is not limited in amount. The available information in ambient light, vibra- tion, contact, and chemical action is inexhaustible.

A stimulus, then, carries some of the meaning that the word had in Latin, a goad stuck into the skin of an ox. It is a brief and discrete application of energy to a sensitive surface. As such, it specifies little beyond itself; it contains no information. But a flowing array of stimulation is a different matter entirely. Ambient Energy as Available Stimulation

The environment of an observer was said to consist of substances, the medium, and surfaces. Gravity, heat, light, sound, and volatile substances fill the medium. Chemical and mechanical contacts and vibrations impinge on the observer's body. The observer is immersed as it were in a sea of physical energy. It is a Howing sea, for it changes and undergoes cycles of change, especially of temper- ature and illumination. The observer, being an organism, exchanges energy with the environment by respiration, food consumption, and behavior. A very small fraction of this ambient sea of energy constitutes stimulation and provides information. The fraction is small, for only the ambient odor entering the nose is effective for smelling, only the train of air vibrations impinging on the eardrums is effective for hearing, and only the ambient light at the entrance pupil of an eye is effective for vision. But this tiny portion of the sea of energy is crucial for survival, because it contains information for things at a distance.

It should be obvious by now that this minute inflow of stimulus energy does not consist of discrete inputs-that stimulation does not consist of stimuli. The flow is continuous. There are, of course, episodes in the flow, but these are nested within one another and cannot be cut up into elementary units. Stimulation is not momentary.

Radiant energy of all wavelengths falls on an individual, that is, impinges on the skin. The infrared radiation will give warmth, and the ultraviolet will cause sunburn, but the narrow band of radiation in between, light, is the only kind that will excite the photoreceptors in the eye after entering the pupil. An eye, or at least a vertebrate chambered eye as distinguished from the faceted eye of an insect, usually takes in something less than a hemisphere of the ambient light, according to G. L. Walls (1942). A pair of eyes like those of a rabbit, pointing in opposite directions, takes in nearly the whole of the ambient 52 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

light at the same time. Ambient light is structured, as we have seen. And the purpose of a dual ocular system is to register this structure or, more exactly, the invariants of its changing structure. Ambient light is usually very rich in what we call pattern and change. The retinal images register both. And a retinal image involves stimulation of its receptive surface but not, as often supposed, a set or a sequence of stimuli.

The Orthodox Theory of the Retinal Image

The generally accepted theory of the eye does not acknowledge that it registers the invariant structure of ambient light but asserts that it forms an image of an object on the back of the eye. The object, of course, is in the outer world, and the back of the eye is a photoreceptive surface attached to a nerve bundle. What is the difference between these theories?

The theory of image formation in a dark chamber like the eye goes back more than 350 years to Johannes Kepler. The germ of the theory as stated by him was that everything visible radiates, more particularly that every point on a body can emit rays in all directions. An opaque reflecting surface, to be sure, receives radiation from a source and then re-emits it, but in effect it becomes a collection of radiating point sources. If an eye is present, a small cone of diver- ging rays enters the pupil from each point source and is caused by the lens to converge to another point on the retina. The diverging and converging rays make what is called a focused pencil of rays. The dense set of focus points on the retina constitutes the retinal image. There is a one-to-one projective corres- pondence between radiating points and focus points.

A focused pencil of rays consists of two parts, the diverging cone of radiant light and the converging cone of rays refracted by the lens, one cone with its vertex on the object and the other with its vertex in the image. This pencil is chen repeated for every point on the object. Thus, there is a limitless set of rays in each pencil and a limitless set of pencils for each object. The history of optics suggests that Kepler was mainly responsible for this extraordinary intellectual invention. It involved difficult ideas, but it was and still is the unchallenged foundation of the theory of image formation. The notion of an object composed of points has proved over the centuries to be sympathetic to physicists, because most of them assume that an object really consists of its atoms. And later, in the nineteenth century, the notion of a retinal image consisting of sharp points of focused light did not seem strange to physiologists because they were familiar with punctate stimuli, for example, on the skin.

This theory of point-to-point correspondence between an object and its image lends itself to mathematical analysis. It can be abstracted to the concepts of projective geometry and can be applied with great success to the design of cameras and projectors, that is, to the making of pictures with light, photo- graphy. The theory permits lenses to be made with smaller"aberrations,"that The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information 53 is, with finer points in the point-to-point correspondence. It works beautifully, in short, for the images that fall on screens or surfaces and that are intended to be looked at. But this success makes it tempting to believe that the image on the retina falls on a kind of screen and is itself something intended to be looked at, that is, a picture. It leads to one of the most seductive fallacies in the history of psychology-that the retinal image is something to be seen. I call this the "little man in the brain"theory of the retinal image (Gibson, 1966b, p. 226)ï¼which conceives the eye as a camera at the end of a nerve cable that transmits the image to the brain. Then there has to be a little man, a homunculus, seated in the brain who looks at this physiological image. The little man would have to have an eye to see it with, of course, a little eye with a little retinal image connected to a little brain, and so we have explained nothing by this theory. We are in fact worse off than before, since we are confronted with the paradox of an infinite series of little men, each within the other and each looking at the brain of the next bigger man.

If the retinal image is not transmitted to the brain as a whole, the only alternative has seemed to be that it is transmitted to the brain element by element, that is, by signals in the fibers of the optic nerve. There would then be an element-to-element correspondence between image and brain analogous to the

point-to-point correspondence between object and image. This seems to avoid the fallacy of the little man in the brain who looks at an image, but it entails all the difficulties of what I have called the sensation-based theories of perception. The correspondence between the spots of light on the retina and the spots of sensation in the brain can only be a correspondence of intensity to brightness and of wavelength to color. If so, the brain is faced with the tremendous task of constructing a phenomenal environment out of spots differing in brightness and color. If these are what is seen directly, what is given for perception, if these are the data of sense, then the fact of perception is almost miraculous.

JAMES MILL ON VISUAL SENSATION, 1829

"When I lift my eyes from the paper on which I am writing, I see from my

window trees and meadows, and horses and oxen, and distant hills. I see

each of its proper size, of its proper form, and at its proper distance; and

these particulars appear as immediate informations of the eye as the colors

which I see by means of it. Yet philosophy has ascertained that we derive

nothing from the eye whatever but sensations of color.. How then, is it

that we receive accurate information by the eye of size and shape and

distance? By association merely"(Mill, Analysis of the Phenomena of the

Human Mind, 1829).

How is it indeed! Mill answered, by association. But others answered, by

innate ideas of space or by rational inference from the sensations or by interpret-

ation of the data. Still others have said, by spontaneous organization of sensory

inputs to the brain. The current fashionable answer is, by computerlike activities

of the brain on neural signals. We have empiricism, nativism, rationalism,

Gestalt theory, and now information-processing theory. Their adherents

would go on debating forever if we did not make a fresh start. Has philo-

sophy ascertained that "we derive nothing from the eye whatever but sensa-

tions of color"? No. "Sensations of color" meant dabs or spots of color, as if

in a painting. Perception does not begin that way.

Even the more sophisticated theory that the retinal image is transmitted as signals in the fibers of the optic nerve has the lurking implication of a little man in the brain. For these signals must be in code and therefore have to be decoded; signals are messages, and messages have to be interpreted. In both theories the eye sends, the nerve transmits, and a mind or spirit receives. Both theories carry the implication of a mind that is separate from a body.

It is not necessary to assume that anything whatever is transmitted along the optic nerve in the activity of perception. We need not believe that either an inverted picture or a set of messages is delivered to the brain. We can think of The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information 55 vision as a perceptual system, the brain being simply part of the system. The eye is also part of the system, since retinal inputs lead to ocular adjustments and then to altered retinal inputs, and so on. The process is circular, not a one-way transmission. The eye-head-brain-body system registers the invariants in the structure of ambient light. The eye is not a camera that forms and delivers an image, nor is the retina simply a keyboard that can be struck by fingers of light. A Demonstration that the Retinal Image is not Necessary for Vision We are apt to forget that an eye is not necessarily a dark chamber, on the back surface of which an inverted image is formed by a lens in the manner described by Kepler. Although the eyes of vertebrates and mollusks are of this sort, the eyes of arthropods are not. They have what is called a compound eye, with no chamber, no lens, and no sensory surface but with a closely packed set of receptive tubes called ommatidia. Each tube points in a different direction from every other tube, and presumably the organ can thus register differences of intensity in different directions. It is therefore part of a system that registers the structure of ambient light.

In a chapter on the evolutionary development of visual systems (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 9), I described the chambered eye and the compound eye as two different ways of accepting an array of light coming from an environment (pp. 163 ff.). The camera eye has a concave mosaic of photoreceptors, a retina. The compound eye has a convex packet of photoreceptive light tubes. The former accepts an infinite number of pencils of light, each focused to a point and combining to make a continuous image. The latter accepts a finite number of samples of ambient light, without focusing them and without forming an optical image. But if several thousand tubes are packed together, as in the eye of a dragonfly, visual perception is quite good. There is nothing behind a dragonfly's eye that could possibly be seen by you, no image on a surface, no picture. But nevertheless the dragonfly sees its environment.

Zoologists who study insect vision are so respectful of optics as taught in physics textbooks that they are constrained to think of a sort of upright image as being formed in the insect eye. But this notion is both vague and self-contra- dictory. There is no screen on which an image could be formed. The concept of an ambient optic array, even if not recognized in optics, is a better founda- tion for the understanding of vision in general than the concept of the retinal image. The registering of differences of intensity in different directions is necessary for visual perception; the formation of a retinal image is not.

The Concept of Optical Information

The concept of information with which we are most familiar is derived from our experiences of communicating with other people and being communicated 56 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

with, not from our experience of perceiving the environment directly. We tend to think of information primarily as being sent and received, and we assume that some intermediate kind of transmission has to occur, a "medium"of communication or a "channel" along which the information is said to flow. Information in this sense consists of messages, signs, and signals. In early times messages, which could be oral, written, or pictorial, had to be sent by runner or by horseman. Then the semaphore system was invented, and then the electrical telegraph, wireless telegraphy, the telephone, television, and so on at an acceler- ated rate of development.

THE FALLACY OF THE IMAGE IN THE EYE

Ever since someone peeled off the back of the excised eye of a slaughtered

ox and, holding it up in front of a scene, observed a tiny, colored, inverted

image of the scene on the transparent retina, we have been tempted to draw

a false conclusion. We think of the image as something to be seen, a picture

on a screen. You can see it if you take out the ox's eye, so why shouldn't the

ox see it? The fallacy ought to be evident.

The question of how we can see the world as upright when the retinal

image is inverted arises because of this false conclusion. All the experiments

on this famous question have come to nothing. The reginal image is not

anything that can be seen. The famous experiment of G. M. Stratton (1897)

on reinverting the retinal image gave unintelligible results because it was

misconceived.

We also communicate with others by making a picture on a surface (clay tablet, papyrus, paper, wall, canvas, or screen)and by making a sculpture, a model, or a solid image. In the history of image-making, the chief technolo- gical revolution was brought about by the invention of photography, that is, of a photosensitive surface that could be placed at the back of a darkened chamber with a lens in front. This kind of communication, which we call graphic or plastic, does not consist of signs or signals and is not so obviously a message from one person to another. It is not so obviously transmitted or conveyed. Pictures and sculptures are apt to be displayed, and thus they contain informa- tion and make it available for anyone who looks. They nevertheless are, like the spoken and written words of language, man-made. They provide information that, like the information conveyed by words, is mediated by the perception of the first observer. They do not permit firsthand experience-only experience at second hand.

The ambient stimulus information available in the sea of energy around us is quite different. The information for perception is not transmitted, does not The Relationship Between Stimulation and Stimulus Information 57 consist of signals, and does not entail a sender and a receiver. The environment does not communicate with the observers who inhabit it. Why should the world speak to us? The concept of stimuli as signals to be interpreted implies some such nonsense as a world-soul trying to get through to us. The world is specified in the structure of the light that reaches us, but it is entirely up to us to perceive it. The secrets of nature are not to be understood by the breaking of its code.

Optical information, the information that can be extracted from a flowing optic array, is a concept with which we are not at all familiar. Being intellectu- ally lazy, we try to understand perception in the same way we understand communication, in terms of the familiar. There is a vast literature nowadays of speculation about the media of communication. Much of it is undisciplined and vague. The concept of information most of us have comes from that literature. But this is not the concept that will be adopted in this book. For we cannot explain perception in terms of communication; it is quite the other way around. We cannot convey information about the world to others unless we have perceived the world. And the available information for our perception is radically different from the information we convey.

Summary

Ecological optics is concerned with many-times-reflected light in the medium, that is, illumination. Physical optics is concerned with electromagnetic energy, that is, radiation.

Ambient light coming to a point in the air is profoundly different from radiant light leaving a point source. The ambient light has structure, whereas the radiant light does not. Hence, ambient light makes available information about reflecting surfaces, whereas radiant light can at most transmit informa- tion about the atoms from which it comes.

If the ambient light were unstructured or undifferentiated, it would provide no information about an environment, although it would stimulate the photore- ceptors of an eye. Thus, there is a clear distinction between stimulus informa- tion and stimulation. We do not have sensations of light triggered by stimuli under normal conditions. The doctrine of discrete stimuli does not apply to ordinary vision.

The orthodox theory of the formation of an image on a screen, based on the correspondence between radiating points and focus points, is rejected as the basis for an explanation of ecological vision. This theory applies to the design of optical instruments and cameras, but it is a seductive fallacy to conceive the ocular system in this way. One of the worst results of the fallacy is the inference that the retinal image is transmitted to the brain.

The information that can be extracted from ambient light is not the kind of information that is transmitted over a channel. There is no sender outside the head and no receiver inside the head.
