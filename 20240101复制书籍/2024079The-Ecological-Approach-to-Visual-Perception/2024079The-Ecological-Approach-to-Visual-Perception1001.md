## 10. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self

Evidence for direct visual perception of the persisting layout of the environ- ment was presented in the last chapter. Persistence, however, is only the comple- ment of change. Is there evidence to suggest that the perception of changing layout is also direct?

The Perception of Changing Surface Layout

Along with the traditional assumption that form perception in the frontal plane is basic and simpler to understand goes the assumption that motion perception in the frontal plane is also basic and simpler to understand. The fallacy of the retinal image and the cues for depth underlies the second assumption as much as the first. But the concept of retinal motion as a"scratching of the retina with pencils of light," as I put it (Gibson, 1968b), is so deep-lying that it is even harder to get rid of than the concept of retinal form. (The retina is a skin for stimuli; a point of light can prod the retina and a moving point of light will scratch the retina.) Only gradually and reluctantly did I give it up, and only when forced to do so by experiments. My present hypothesis is that the perception of events depends upon nothing less than disturbances of structure in the ambient array. I described and listed them in Chapter 6. Disturbances of structure can specify events without being similar to them.

Apparatus for the Study of Motion in the Frontal Plane

In order to study a kind of perception, an experimenter must devise an apparatus that will display the information for that kind of perception. Until recently, the principal types of apparatus devised for the perception of motion were as follows. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 163 The Stroboscope and Its Variants

The stroboscope is a device that exposes or flashes different stationary patterns in succession. Cinematography developed from this device (but not television). Since each successive "stimulus"was motionless and the retina was thus never "stimulated"by motion, the motion perceived was said to be only "apparent," not "real." But this assertion is an example of the muddled thinking to which the theory of stimuli can lead. The stimulus information for motion is the change of pattern, and the information is the same for an intermittent change as for a continuous change. The stroboscope demonstrates only that the motion of an object in the world from one place to another does not have to be copied by a corresponding motion of an image on the retina from one point to another in order for the event to be perceived. But we should never have supposed in the first place that the motion did have to be copied on the retina.

The Moving Endless Belt

A striped or textured surface behind a window in the frontal plane can be made to move continuously in a certain direction and at any chosen speed. Many experiments were carried out with this device before I realized what was wrong. The results for speed and velocity, far from being simple, were complex and puzzling. The just-noticeable speed, for example, could not be determined, although if motion on the retina were a stimulus this variable should have an absolute threshold. Eventually I came to suspect that what the eye was picking up was not the"motion"of the surface relative to the window but the progressive revealing and concealing of the elements of the surface at the occluding edges of the window(Gibson, 1968b).

The Rotating Disk Apparatus

If a color wheel is made to rotate slowly instead of rapidly, the motion of the surface of the disk can be seen. The disk can be displayed either behind a circular window or in front of a background. If the observer fixates the center of the disk, no eye movements occur to complicate the retinal image, which is a circle and its surroundings. But does this retinal change constitute a motion, as the term is understood in physics, a rotary spin measured in terms of degrees of arc per second of time? No, it does not. I finally came to understand that the wheeling of the circle in its surrounding is actually a shearing of the texture of the array at the contour of the circle.

A disk of this sort can also be used as a turntable for a blank circular sheet of paper on which forms are drawn. With rotation of the disk the forms undergo orbital motions, and sometimes very curious perceptions result. 164 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The Disk-and-Slot Apparatus

If a spiral line is drawn on such a disk instead of a texture, a perception of expan- sion (or contraction) is induced when the disk is rotated slowly. And if it is screened except for a slot, the perception of a thing moving along the slot will occur. A. Michotte (1963) has used this device to study the perception of one thing bumping another, for example. In these cases, the optical motions in the array of light from the display are radically different from the mechanical motions of the apparatus that produced them. This radical difference has seemed very puzzling to believers in retinal image optics; it becomes intelligible only with the acceptance of ecological optics. The perception of what might be called slot-motion with Michotte's apparatus is particularly interesting, for it seems to depend on what happens optically at the edges of an aperture or window. The Method of Shadow Projection

Beginning with the Chinese shadow plays of antiquity, moving shadows have been cast on a screen to induce the perception of moving objects or persons. The light source must be either very small or very distant to make the contour of the silhouette sharp. The opaque object, the shadow caster, is properly said to be projected on the screen by radiant light, that is, by rectilinear rays. (Note parenthetically that the light from the screen to the point of observation should not be said to be projected, strictly speaking, since it is ambient light and its array consists of visual solid angles, not rays. But I have not conformed to this strict usage. Projection from a very small, near source is polar in that the rays diverge from a point. Projection from a very distant source like the sun is parallel inasmuch as the rays do not diverge.

With an opaque screen, the radiant light and the ambient array are on the same side of the screen and the observer can see the shadow caster. With a translucent screen, however, the light to the screen and the array from the screen can be on opposite sides, and the observer cannot see the shadow caster. The visual solid angle of the shadow surrounded by light constitutes informa- tion for perceiving an object on an empty background, that is, a virtual object seen as if against the sky.

The shadow caster, an opaque surface or object, can be mounted on a trans- parent sheet and caused to move by the experimenter. Or the mount can be treated so as to be opaque in some parts and transparent in others, or to vary from opaque to transparent. The latter case is essentially that of the photo- graphic lantern slide. The projection of photographic pictures, either singly or in sequence, is in principle no more than the casting of shadows on a screen corresponding to the varying opacity of the film.

The motion of the virtual object that an observer sees behind the screen corresponds to the motion of the shadow caster, but with certain inverse Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 165 relationships. Motion away from the observer corresponds to motion away from the point source of light. But the "motion" of the shadow itself on the screen (if it can be called that) is a size change, a minification.

Shadow projection is vastly more flexible and powerful than the other methods for studying the perception of motion. But how to use it for studies of event perception is only now beginning to become clear. The art and techno- logy of the "picture show," as the man in the street calls it, have become fully and elaborately developed in modern times, but without any scientific discipline on which to base them. The production of moving displays with "animated" film, and by means of computer-controlled motions of a cathode ray beam on the screen of an oscilloscope, are both complex elaborations of this method of projection (e.g., Green, 1961ï¼› Braunstein, 1962a and b). I will return to the problem of the displaying of optical motions in the last chapter of this book.

Experiments on the Kinetic Depth Effect, or Stereokinesis

C. L. Musatti(1924)demonstrated many years ago that a drawing composed of circles or ellipses that looked flat when stationary would go into depth when it underwent an orbital motion on a turntable. Everybody knew that a pair of flat forms having binocular disparity would go into depth when they were looked at in a stereoscope, but the idea of flat drawing being given depth by motion was surprising. Musatti called it the stereokinetic phenomenon.

The fact seemed to be that certain motions in the frontal plane could generate a perception of motion in depth. The idea was that elementary motions on the retina could combine to give the experience of a real motion in space, the latter being of an entirely different sort from the former. Ten years later, W. Metzger (1934)reported what he called "appearances of depth in moving fields," and much later H. Wallach described what he called the "kinetic depth effect" (Wallach and O'Connell, 1953). No one imagined that a moving volume could be perceived directly, the motion and the volume at the same time, for they assumed that retinal sensations were the necessary basis of perception.

Wallach's kinetic depth effect is obtained when the shadow of a configuartion made of bent wire is projected on a translucent screen and observed from the other side. Without motion the lines appear flat, as if drawn on the screen. But when the wire object is turned the disposition of the wires in space becomes evident. The shift from a flat picture to a moving bent wire is very striking. Why should this occur? Wallach's formula was that the flat pattern went into depth when the lines on the screen changed in both direction and length concurrently (Wallach and O'Connell, 1953).

This formula is not very illuminating. A better one was being worked out at about that time by G. Johansson (1950), to the effect that if a set of several separate motions in the frontal plane can be resolved into some single motion of a rigid volume, then this rigid motion will be perceived in depth. This formula 166 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

is reminiscent of one of Wertheimer's laws of the supposed organization of sensory elements in the brain, the law of "common fate," which says that a collection of spots will be grouped to form a gestalt if they move in the same way. But Wertheimer never said exactly what he meant by "the same way."

Johansson's experiments were carried out at first with moving spots or lines projected on a translucent screen. But he later used a set of luminous elements on the screen of a cathode ray tube, which could be programmed to move in any direction, up, down, right, and left. He used vector analysis to determine the "common motion"in the cluster of elements. Ifthe motions were "coherent," or if the cluster were coherent under motion, the elements would be perceived as an object in depth instead of a mere frontal pattern. They would appear to be a rigidly connected set of elements, like a three-dimensional lattice in space or a polyhedron of solid geometry.

The hypothesis that individual sensory elements are grouped or made to cohere in the process of perception is an axiom of Gestalt theory, which assumes that sensations are the necessary basis of perception. If it were not for the process of organization, the individual sensations of motion would yield individual perceptions of object motion in the frontal plane. The theory of organization with reference to motion is adopted by Metzger (1953)as well as by Johansson (1950). But there is another theoretical possibility, namely, that an optical trans- formation that is already coherent does not have to be made coherent in the process of perception; it is simply picked up. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 167 Experiments with Progressive Magnification or Minification

The first results that began to suggest a direct perception of motion in depth were those of W. Schiff, J. A. Caviness, and J. J. Gibson in 1962. A point-source shadow projector is used with a large translucent screen six feet square and with the point of observation close to the screen. A small, dark silhouette at the center of the screen can be magnified over an interval of several seconds until it fills the screen. The observer sees an indefinite obiect coming at him and coming up to his face. He gets an experience that might justly be called visual collision. Without any mechanical contact, the information for optical contact has been provided. The observer has no sensation of touch, but he blinks his eyes and may duck or dodge involuntarily. It seemed to me that this optical change, whatever it was. should be considered a "stimulus" for the blink reflex as much as a puff of air to the cornea of the eye should be (Gibson, 1957). But it was surely not a stimulus in the ordinary meaning of the term. It was an optical expansion or magnification of an intercept angle toward its theoretical limit of 180Â°. This is the visual solid angle of natural perspective.

Experiments showed that the size and the distance of the virtual object were indefinite but that its approach was perfectly definite. After the shadow filled the screen, the virtual obiect seemed to be "here," at zero distance. It did not look like a shadow on the screen but looked like an object. The object in fact came out of the screen. This was only to be expected, for, by the laws of natural perspective, the closer an object comes to the point of observation, the closer its solid angle will come to a hemisphere of the ambient array.

There seemed to be a direct perception of an event that could be described as approach-of-something. This perception was not based on a sensation of expan- sion or enlargement. Observers reported that the object did not seem to get larger, as a rubber balloon does, and that they did not notice the increasing size of the shadow as such unless the magnification was quite slow. The object appeared to be rigid, not elastic.

The magnification of the visual solid angle of an obiect normally accelerates as it approaches the limit of a hemispheric angle, as the object comes up to the eye. The accelerated portion of this sequence was called "looming"by Schiff, Caviness, and Gibson (1962). It specifies impending collision, and the rate of magnification is proportional to the imminence of the collision. Schiff (1965)adapted the looming apparatus to test the behavior of animals. He used monkeys, kittens, chicks, frogs, and fiddler crabs. All of them showed avoidance behavior or withdrawal analogous to the ducking or dodging of the human observer. As a control, the animals were presented with minification of the shadow, the temporal reverse of magnification. The animals showed either no response or one that could be interpreted as curiosity. Presumably, what they saw was something going away in the distance but nothing that threatened collision. When the screen was simply darkened (or lightened), the animals did 168 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

not respond. And, of course, the unchanging silhouette on the screen caused no response.

The flinching of the human observer in this experiment usually extin- guished after a few repetitions, but that of the animals mostly did not. However, although the human behavior changed, the human perception did not, that is, the awareness of something approaching did not extinguish with repetition. The perception evidently did not depend on the learning of a conditioned with- drawal response reinforced by mechanical collision.

In other experiments it was established that when the magnification of the shadow was not symmetrical but skewed, the animal (a crab) dodged appropri- ately to the left or right, as the path of the virtual object moved to the right or left of the animal's position (Schiff, 1965, pp. 16-18). Human observers see some- thing approaching but approaching a position off to one side instead of the point of observation being occupied, and they can judge how far the ghostly object would pass by on the right or left. Presumably it is this sort of optical information that one uses in dodging a thrown rock, or catching a thrown ball, for that matter. There will be more about magnification in Chapter 13 on locomotion

The fact that a fiddler crab behaved as if it perceived the same event as the vertebrate animals and the human observers was very suggestive. The crab does not have a camera eye or a retinal image, and retinal image optics cannot be applied to it. But ecological optics works very well for the compound eye, for it is constructed of tubes pointing in different directions (Gibson, 1966b, p. 164). Experiments with Progressive Transformations

In geometry the magnification or minification of a form is sometimes called a size transformation (or a similarity transformation). But the ordinary meaning of the term is change of form, and the most familiar transformation is a perspective transformation. In the theory of perspective drawing, artificial perspective, it is called foreshortening. It is the parameter of transformation that converts a rect- angle into a trapezoid when the rectangular surface is slanted away from the frontal plane. If a progressive transformation was a "stimulus"for space percep- tion, as I thought (Gibson, 1957), then it was more fundamental than the kinetic depth effect and I should carry out a proper psychophysical experiment with this slant transformation. I was still thinking of slant as a basic variable in the perception of layout, and I still had in mind all the experiments that had been done on the perceiving of a constant form with varying slant, the puzzle of form constancy. I was still assuming vaguely that the perceiving of "forms," whatever they were, was basic to other kinds of perceiving.

So my wife and I collaborated in an investigation of what people see with a systematic variation of the amount of foreshortening, using the shadow projec- tion apparatus (Gibson and Gibson, 1957). The shadow projected on the screen was either a regular form (a square), a regular texture (a square of squares), an Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 169 irregular form (ameboid shape), or an irregular texture (a potato-shaped group of small ameboid shapes). Each of these silhouettes underwent cycles of trans- formation, the shadow caster being turned back and forth through an angle that varied from 15Â° to 70Â°. The observer had to indicate the amount of change of slant he perceived, using an adjustable protractor.

All subjects without exception perceived the changing slant of an unchanging rigid surface. It was not an object, to be sure, only the face of an object, a sheet, but its shape was definite and it was not in the least elastic. It simply turned back and forth. If one paid attention to it, one could say that the shadow on the screen was squeezed or compressed, but not the sheet. There was no difference between the regular and the irregular silhouettes in this respect. The angle of the change of slant could be judged with considerable accuracy. The regular patterns, however, did not show more accuracy than the irregular, and there was no difference between what I called the forms and the textures.

These results did not fit with the traditional concepts of form and depth percep- tion. They were upsetting. They seemed to imply that a certain change of form could yield a constant form with a change of slant, but this surely involves a muddle of thought. Evidently, the meaning of the term form is slippery and, if so, it is nonsense to talk about form perception (Gibson, 1951). What emerged over time during the cycles of change was a distinctive object. The hypothesis that began to suggest itself was that an object is specified by invariants under transformation. Far

from being forms, these invariants are quite "formless"; they are invariants of structure. Presumably, the four different surfaces in this experiment were specified by different invariants under foreshortening, and the different changes of slant were specified at the same time by different amounts of foreshortening.

An optical transformation, then, was not a set of discrete optical motions. nor was it a cause of depth perception. It was a single, global, lawful change in the array that specified both an unchanging object and its changing position, both at the same time.

The Puzzle of Phenomenal Rigidity

It began to be clear that the heart of the problem lay in the perception of rigidity and the information to specify rigidity, not in the perception of form and depth. Could it be that certain definable transformations in the optic array were specific to rigid motions and that others specified nonrigid motions? More precisely, the hypothesis would be that certain invariants specified rigidity and that other invariants specified elasticity. This line of thinking had great promise. The elastic bending of a sheet or stick preserves connectivity but not proportion- ality. So does the stretching of a sheet or stick. But the breaking of it does not even preserve connectivity, except in the broken parts. And the crumbling of a surface does not even preserve the surface, which, by disintegrating, ceases to exist. The invariants in this hierarchy are linked both to the meaningful substances of the environment and to abstract mathematics.

What experiments were possible? It was not easy to think of a way to isolate and control an invariant. K. von Fieandt and J. J. Gibson (1959) did a more modest experiment. They presented observers with the transformation of compressing followed by its inverse, and then the transformation of foreshort- ening followed by its inverse, to see if observers would spontaneously notice the difference and perceive an elastic event in the first case and a rigid event in the second case. They defined stretching as change in one dimension only, width or height but not both, as exemplified by square-into-rectangle. Foreshortening was exemplified by square-into-trapezoid, as in the Gibson and Gibson experiment described above (1957).

The experimenters projected on the translucent screen the shadow of an irregular elastic fishnet, which was stretched on a frame mounted between the point source and the screen. One end of the frame could be made to slide inward and outward, or the whole frame could be turned back and forth. The frame was invisible, and the texture filled the screen. The motions of the elements on the screen were very similar in the two cases. But observers had no difficulty in distinguishing between the virtual surface in the two cases, elastic in the first and rigid in the second.

Johansson (1964)studied the effects of changing the height and width of a rectangle in a highly ingenious way. He generated a luminous figure on an Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 171 oscilloscope screen with independent control of its height and width. He could stretch and then compress either dimension in repeated cycles. When both dimensions were increased or decreased at the same time, he got magnification and minification, which yielded clear perception of a rigid object approaching and then receding. But he was interested in elastic motion. So he made the cycles of changing height and width out of phase. But he did not then obtain perceptions of the elastic motions of a variable rectangle as one might expect. Instead, there was a strong tendency to see a virtual rectangular object with three parameters of rigid motion, not two, an object turning on a vertical axis, turning on a horizontal axis, and moving forward and backward, all at the same time in different cycles.

We do not yet know the exact basis for the perception of rigidity-elasticity, although research is progressing at both Uppsala in Sweden and at Cornell in the U.S.A. These experiments are curious and interesting and have already produced some surprising discoveries.

An Experiment on the Perception of Separation in Depth

What information specifies the connectedness of an object, its unbroken char- acter? The gestalt theorists had emphasized the unity or coherence of the parts of a form, but it began to be evident that the unity or coherence of a substance was a more basic fact. How do we see the singleness of a detached object? A single object has a topologically closed surface; it is a substance completely surrounded by the medium or, in mathematical terms, a surface that returns upon itself. The detached obiect can be moved without breaking its surface. Its substance is separated from adjacent substances by air. One object becomes two only when its substance has been ruptured. How do we see this unbroken connectedness?

The first experiment to suggest that this basic fact might be specified optic- ally was supposed to be an experiment on motion parallax and depth percep- tion but turned out to be an experiment on the perception of separation in depth(E. J. Gibson, Gibson, Smith, and Flock, 1959). The point-source shadow projector was set up to throw on the screen two random textures intermixed and filling the screen Actually, there were two transparent sheets of glass, each sprinkled with talcum powder. This kind of texture yields the perception of a surface but not one whose elements are geometrical forms. The phenomenal surface is coherent and continuous but without lines, contours, or definite spots. It looks like the surface of a plaster wall or a cloud.

The two shadow casters could be either motionless or moving. When they were both motionless or moving across the window at the same speed, only one virtual surface was perceived. But when there was a difference in speed between the two optical textures, a splitting of the surface in two, a separation in depth, resulted. The perception was of twoness instead of oneness but not of two forms. It was as if the formerly coherent surface had become layered. The striking fact 172 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

This is a view from above. The two textured sheets of glass are indicated by the parallel dashed lines. They move together on the same carriage, but their separation can be increased from zero. In a unit of time, the shadow at the center of one sheet sweeps through a certain angle, and the corresponding shadow on the other sheet sweeps through a different angle, as shown. The ratio of the lesser to the greater visual angle is the inverse of the ratio of the distances of their respective sheets from the point source.

was that although this separation was "in depth"the difference in depth was equivocal. The faster motion was not necessarily seen in front of the other, as the law of motion parallax would predict. The surface in front had to appear semitransparent, of course, but every now and then the front-back relation between the two surfaces would spontaneously be reversed.

Wherein lay the information for this splitting? One half of the interspersed elements of texture all moved with one velocity, and the other half all moved with another velocity. Hence, there was a permutation of the adjacent order of the texture elements. When some caught up with and passed others, the adjacent order was destroyed. The permutation was not complete, to be sure, for each set of elements preserved adjacent order, but the original connectivity had been destroyed. Hence, the phenomenal continuity of the original surface gave way to the perception of two continuous surfaces, the nearest being transparent (E. J. Gibson, Gibson, Smith, and Flock, 1959, pp. 45 ff.). Thus, the available information in an optic array for continuity could be described as the preserva- tion of adjacent order, which is to say, the absence of its permutation. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 173

A permutation of adjacent order is a more radical change than a transformation that leaves adjacent order invariant. A size transformation and the rigid trans- formation of foreshortening, as well as the nonrigid transformation of stretching, leave order invariant. A still more radical change than permutation is possible, however, and this was suggested by another experiment. It is a change that subtracts elements of the array on one side of a contour or adds them on. I have called this change progressive deletion or accretion of structure. But this belongs in the next chapter. Experiments on the Perception of Collision

In Chapter 6 the kind of mechanical event called a collision was described. In the simplest case, a collision may be one elastic object such as a billiard ball bumping another and causing it to move. Michotte (1963)used the disk-and-slot appar- atus to study the optical and temporal conditions for this perception. He found, contrary to the assertion of David Hume, that the actual "launching" of one object by another can be seen, not just the succession of two discrete motions. In other words, one gets a direct causal perception over and above the kinetic sensations when the time intervals fall within certain limits.

Michotte was concerned with the phenomenology of the causal impression. He did not consider the hypothesis that there could be a display of optical inform- ation for the perception of one object launching another. His results are consistent with that hypothesis, however. S. Runeson (1977) has based a series of experi- ments on it. He has studied the perception of two-body linear collisions that vary from elastic to damped. In a real collision, the relative velocity difference between the motions before and after contact is invariant and specifies the nature of the substances. This is what he varied. In his experiments, not only was the collision perceived as such, but the hardness or softness of the objects themselves were also. Yet, all the observer could ever"see"was a pair of moving patches on the screen of an oscilloscope.

Runeson had studied ecological dynamics. He had discovered an inform- ative invariant and had controlled it in his display. We shall begin to understand event perception if we follow this lead.

The Coperception of One's Own Movement

So far we have been considering the perception of motion in the world. We now come to the problem of the perceiver's awareness of his own motion in the world, that is, the awareness of locomotion.

The Discovery of Visual Kinesthesis

In the 1940s, great numbers of students were being trained to fly military airplanes, and considerable numbers were failing. It seemed sensible to try and 174 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

find out whether a student could see what was necessary in order to land a plane before taking him up and trying to teach him to land it without crashing. One thing he had to see was the aiming point of a landing glide, the direction in which he was going. A test was devised consisting of a series of motion picture shots with a camera dollying down toward a model runway (Gibson, 1947ï¼ŒCh. 9). The testee had to say whether he was aiming at spot A, B, C, or D, all marked on the runway. This was a test of "landing judgment," and it was the beginning of an inquiry that went on for years.

It turns out that the aiming point of any locomotion is the center of the cent- rifugal flow of the ambient optic array. Whatever object or spot on the ground is specified at that null point is the object or spot you are approaching. This is an exact statement. But since I could not conceive of the ambient optic array in 1947, only the retinal image, I first tried to state the flow in terms of retinal motion and gradients of retinal velocity. Such a statement cannot be made exact and leads to contradictions. Not until later were the principles of the two foci of radial outflow and inflow in the whole array at a moving point of observation described precisely (Gibson, Olum, and Rosenblatt, 1955).

In the 1955 paper, the authors gave a mathematical description of "motion perspective"in the optic array, for any direction of locomotion relative to a flat earth. All optical flow vanishes at the horizon and also at the two centers that specify going toward and coming from. Motion perspective was much more than the cue"of motion parallax. As this had been formulated by Helmholtz, it was no more than a rule for "drawing conclusions" about the distance of an object, and in any case the rule did not hold for an object on the line of locomotion. Motion perspective did not refer to "apparent"motions of objects but referred to the layout of the earth. And it "told"the observer not only about the earth but also about himself, the fact of his locomotion and the direction of it. The focus of outflow (or the center of optical expansion) is not a sensory cue but an optical invariant, a nonchange in the midst of change. The focus is formless and is the same for any kind of structure, for grass, trees, a brick wall, or the surface of a cloud.

Student pilots see where they are going on the basis of this invariant and get better with practice. Drivers of cars see where they are going, if they pay atten- tion. Viewers of a Cinerama screen see where they are going in the represented environment. A bee that lands on a flower must see where it is going. And all of them at the same time see the layout of the environment through which they are going. This is a fact with extremely radical implications for psychology, for it is difficult to understand how a train of signals coming in over the optic nerve could explain it. How could signals have two meanings at once, a subjective meaning and an objective one? How could signals yield an experi- ence of self-movement and an experience of the external world at the same time? How could visual motion sensations get converted into a stationary environment and a moving self? The doctrine of the special senses and the theory of sensory channels come into question. A perceptual system must be at Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 175

work that extracts invariants. Exteroception and proprioception must be

complementary.

There are various ways of putting this discovery, although old words must

be used in new ways since age-old doctrines are being contradicted. I suggested

that vision is kinesthetic in that it registers movements of the body just as much

as does the muscle-joint-skin system and the inner ear system. Vision picks up

both movements of the whole body relative to the ground and movement of a

member of the body relative to the whole. Visual kinesthesis goes along with

muscular kinesthesis. The doctrine that vision is exteroceptive, that it obtains

"external"information only, is simply false. Vision obtains information about

both the environment and the self. In fact, all the senses do so when they are

considered as perceptual systems (Gibson, 1966b).

Vision, of course, is also statesthetic, if one wants to be precise about words, in that

it picks up nonmovement of the body and its members. But since nonmovement is

actually only a limiting case of movement, the term kinesthesis will do for both. The

point is that a flowing and an arrested optic array specify respectively an observer in

locomotion and an observer at rest, relative to a fixed environment. Motion and rest

are in fact what an observer experiences with flow and nonflow of the array.

Optical motion perspective is not the same as visual kinesthesis. Motion

perspective is an abstract way of describing the information in an ambient array

at a moving point of observation. If the information is picked up, both visual

layout perception and visual kinesthesis will occur. But motion perspective is

analyzed for an ambient array at an unoccupied point of observation. In visual

kinesthesis, on the other hand, the nose and the body are visible. There is

information for coperceiving the self as well as for perceiving the layout.

Another preliminary point should be made. It is most important not to

confuse visual kinesthesis with visual feedback, a term that has currency in

psychology and physiology today but is not very clear. The term is used with

reference to voluntary movement in connection with the control of purposive

action. If a movement is caused by a command in the brain, the efferent impulses

in motor nerves are followed by afferent impulses in sensory nerves that are

actually reafferent, that is, impulses that are fed back into the brain. Feedback,

therefore, comes with an active movement. But not all movements are active:

some are passive, as when a bird is moved in the wind or a person is moved in

a vehicle. Visual kinesthesis is the same for a passive as for an active movement,

but visual feedback is absent with a passive movement. The problem of the

information for a given movement should not be confounded with the additional

problem of the control of movement. Visual kinesthesis is important in the

control of locomotion but is not the same thing. It is true that we often need to

see how we have just moved in order to decide how to move next. But the first

question is, how do we see how we have just moved?

The current confusion between kinesthesis and feedback helps to explain

why visual kinesthesis is not recognized as a fact of psychology. But it is a fact, 176 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

shown by the following experiments on the inducing of the experience of passive movement.

Experiments with Visual Kinesthesis

Until recently, most of the evidence about induced ego movement had to come from motion pictures, or simulators for training, or amusement park devices. The flow of the optic array in a glide path can be represented, more or less, in a motion picture (Gibson, 1947, pp. 230 ff.); the observer will see himself moving down toward a pseudoairfield, however much he is still aware of being seated in a room and looking at a screen. With a Cinerama screen, the virtual window may sample as much as 160Â° of the ambient array, instead of the mere 20Â° or 30Â° of the usual movie theater, and the illusion of locomotion may then be compelling, uncomfortably so. Training devices with a panoramic curved screen of 200Â° from side to side have been used; for example, one such device simulates flight in a helicopter, and the experience of rising, flying, banking, and landing is so vivid that the illusion of reality is almost complete, although the observer's body is always anchored to the floor. Attempts have also been made to simulate automobile driving.

In the best of these displays, the laws of both natural angular perspective and motion perspective have been observed. The virtual world, the layout of earth and objects, appears to be stationary and rigid. Only the observer moves. But if the projection system or the lens system that creates the display is imperfect, stretching or rubbery motions of the layout will be seen. Then the nonrigid appearance of the environment is not only disconcerting but also often leads to nausea.

The laws of motion perspective for flight over the earth with its horizon can even be set into a computer, which then generates a display on a television screen that simulates any desired maneuver. But all these experiments, if they can be called that, have been done in the interests of the aviation industry rather than those of understanding perception, and the reports are found only in the technical engineering literature.

The reader may have observed that what is called a dolly shot in cinemato- graphy will give the viewer the experience of being a spectator following behind or moving ahead of a character who is walking along. The arrangement of the surfaces and other persons in the scene is more vividly given than it is in a stationary shot. The dolly shot is to be distinguished from the panning shot, where the viewer gets the experience not of locomotion but of turning the head while keeping the same point of observation.

The Gliding Room Experiment

Recently, a laboratory apparatus has been constructed for the stated purpose of investigating visual kinesthesis during locomotion and separating it from the Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 177 kinesthesis of the muscle-joint-skin system and the vestibular system (Lishman and Lee, 1973). The flow of the ambient array is produced by a moving enclosure, a room of sorts with walls and ceilings that can be made to glide over the real floor since it is hung by its corners from a great height barely above the Hoor. I am tempted to call it an invisibly moving room because, except for the floor, there is no information for the room's motion relative to the earth. It is a pseudoenvironment. If contact of the feet with the surface of support is obscured and if the floor is hidden, the illusion of being moved forward and backward in the room is compelling. This is accomplished by what Lishman and Lee call a trolley, in which the observer stands (cf. also Lee, 1974).

Rotations of the Body: Swinging, Tilting, Turning

Besides the linear locomotions of the body, there are the movements of rota- tion, which can occur on a lateral axis, a front-back axis, or a head-foot axis. The movement of a child in a swing has a component of rotation on a lateral axis, like a somersault. The movement of tilting sideways is a rotation on a front-back axis. The movement of being turned in a swivel chair or of turning the head is rotation on a head-foot axis. Pure visual kinesthesis of all these rota- tions can be induced with an invisibly moving room, that is, by putting the observer in an enclosure, supporting him on an inconspicuous surface attached to the earth, and then rotating the enclosure.

An amusement park device called the Haunted Swing used to be popular. A couple entered what appeared to be an ordinary room and were seated in a swing hanging from a bar running horizontally across the room. The room, not the seat, then began to swing on the shaft from which the seat was suspended. When the room eventually made a complete revolution, the occupants felt themselves go head over heels. What a sensation! It should be noted that the illusion vanished if the eyes were shut, as would be expected with visual kines- thesis. An account of the experience and the original reference are given by Gibson and Mowrer (1938).

An experimental room can be made to tilt on a front-back axis, with an observer in an upright seat. Tilting rooms of this sort have been built in labor- atories, and they produced a large literature some twenty years ago(for example, Witkin, 1949). As the room invisibly rotates. both one's body and the chair seem to rotate in the room. Some part of the experienced body tilt usually remains even after the room has become stationary. This latter fact, the feeling of one's posture as dependent on both the visual sense and the bodily senses, was what aroused the greatest interest of experimenters. The arguments in terms of sensations were inconclusive, however. For a discussion of the "phenomenal vertical"in terms of stimuli and cues, see Gibson (1952).

Finally, an experimental room can be made to rotate on a vertical axis. This is a common apparatus in many laboratories, going under the name of an optokinetic 178 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

drum. (See, for example, Smith and Bojar, 1938). It has usually been thought of as a device for studying the eye movements of animals instead of visual kinesthesis, but it can be adapted for the human observer. A textured enclosure, usually a vertically striped cylinder, is rotated around the animal, whose head-eye system then shows the same compensatory movements that it would if the animal were really being turned. Optically, although not inertially, it is being turned. Human subjects usually say that they feel themselves being turned. There must be a real surface of support, however, and, in my experiments, the illusion seemed to depend on not seeing it, or not paying attention to the floor under one's feet. You could anchor yourself to that, if you tried, and then you become aware of the hidden environment outside the room.

What is picked up in these three cases of swinging, tilting, and turning must be a relation between the ambient optic array specifying the world and the edges of the field of view specifying the self. As already suggested, the upper and lower edges of the field of view sweep over the ambient array in swinging; the field of view wheels over the array in tilting; and the lateral edges of the field sweep across the array in turning. These three kinds of information were described in Chapter 7.

It should be noted that, insofar as the three rotations of the body occur without locomotion through the environment, motion perspective does not arise and the ambient array does not flow. The information for the perception of layout is thus minimal.

To speak of the environment being rotated relative to the observer in these cases (instead of the body being rotated relative to the environment) would be simply nonsense. The environment, in the sense of the persisting environment, is that with reference to which objects move, animals move, and surfaces deform. There has to be an underlying nonchange if change is to be specified. The prin- ciple of the relativity of motion cannot be applied to rotation of the body.

Visual Kinesthesis of the Limbs and Hands

Chapter 7, on the optical information for perceiving one's body and its movements, contained a section on the limbs and hands. Certain shapes protrude into the field of view, or else the field sweeps down to reveal them. If they squirm restlessly and are five-pronged, they specify hands. Every manip- ulation is specified by a corresponding change in the five-pronged silhouette. Reaching, grasping, letting go, plucking, and twisting are controlled by the ongoing optical motions that specify them, as I shall emphasize in Chapter 13.

There are no experiments, however, on this kind of visual kinesthesis. Only so-called eye-hand coordination has been recognized, as if sensations from the eye and the hand had to be associated and that were the end of it. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 179 Summary

Evidence for the direct perception of changing layout in the environment and evidence for the direct perception of the movement of the self relative to the environment have been summarized. The awareness of the world and the awareness of the self in the world seemed to be concurrent. Both event motion in the world and locomotion of the self can be given by vision, the former by a local change in the perspective structure and the latter by a global change of the perspective structure of the ambient optic array.

The visual perception of motion in general has been taken to depend on a set of discrete motions of stimuli over the retina. If this is so, an explanation is required of how they are made to cohere in the process of perception. Experiments on the "grouping" of spot motions are inspired by this requirement, as are theories of so-called kinetic depth. But if a change in the optic array is already coherent, its elements do not have to be made coherent.

Experiments with progressive magnification and experiments with progressive transformation suggested that a coherent change in the optic array could be picked up by the visual system. The first kind yielded a direct perception of an approaching object and the second kind that of a turning surface. The perception of these two events was vivid and precise. The imminence of collision and the angular degree of turning could be judged correctly.

The virtual object in these experiments did not change size or shape. It was rigid. The changing perspective shadows on the screen were not noticed.

The distinguishing of nonrigid motions such as stretching, bending, and twisting seems to be possible along with the perception of approaching and turning. The Uppsala experiments show this clearly.

The perception of the rupturing of a surface by separation in depth seems to be possible along with the perception of its displacement. This experiment suggests that the optical information for "surfaciness" is not just the proximity of the units in the array, as was implied in the last chapter, but is the nonper- mutation of the adjacent order of these persisting units over time.

Experiments on visual kinesthesis are even harder to set up in the laboratory than experiments on visual event perception. One needs a panoramic motion picture screen, or a pseudoenvironment like the invisibly moving room, to produce the full illusion of passive locomotion. And there is danger of falling into epistemological confusion about the real environment. But the evidence is enough to show that the theory of motion perspective in the ambient array applies to the awareness of locomotion.

Moreover, the awareness of swinging, tilting, and turning of the observer's body can be induced if an enclosure, a pseudoenvironment, is rotated around the observer on the appropriate axis.
