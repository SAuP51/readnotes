## 12. Looking with the Head and Eyes

We modern, civilized, indoors adults are so accustomed to looking at a page or a picture, or through a window, that we often lose the feeling of being surrounded by the environment, our sense of the ambient array of light. Even when outdoors under the sky, one is apt to be driving an automobile and looking only through the windshield, or traveling in a vehicle where the window to the outside world is constricted to a small angle. We do not look around.

We live boxed-up lives. Our ancestors were always looking around. They surveyed the environment, for they needed to know where they were and what there was in all directions. Children pay attention to their surroundings when allowed to do so. Animals must do so. But we adults spend most of our time looking at instead of looking around. In order to look around, of course, one must turn one's head.

Looking Around and Looking At

The reason why humans must turn their heads in order to look around is that their eyes are set in the front of their heads instead of on either side, as they are in horses or rabbits. The orbits in the human skull are frontal, not lateral. The horse can see most of its surroundings (but not all) without having to turn its head; it can see around fairly well without having to look around. Thus, an enemy can sneak up on a person from behind, sometimes, but the hunter cannot sneak up on a rabbit. It has been suggested that animals who are preyed upon need a more panoramic field of view, whereas predatory animals such as cats can afford to have eyes in the front of the head (Walls, 1942). It has also been argued that the frontal eyes of primates living in the trees afford better "depth perception,"but this argument presupposes the entrenched fallacy of depth 194 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

perception that this book has been at such pains to destroy. Even if depth were perceived, it would be another error to assume that the only kind of depth perception is"binocular," that is, the kind that rests on binocular disparity.

With lateral eyes, the blind region behind the animal is minimal, but the overlap of the fields of view ahead of the animal is sacrificed. With frontal eyes. the overlap of the fields of view ahead is maximal, but the scope of the field of view is sacrificed and the blind region is large. Complete simultaneous ambi- ence of perception is impossible. There has to be some gap in the combined field of view simply because the body of the animal itself is there, that is, its body is bound to hide some of the surfaces of the surrounding environment. Simultaneous ambience of perception is unnecessary in any case if the animal can always turn its head. There is no need to perceive everything at once if everything can be perceived in succession.

The gap in the combined field of view of the eyes is that portion of the ambient optic array filled by the head and body of the observer himself. It is a visual solid angle with a closed envelope, a closed boundary in the array that specifies the body. It has a meaning, and it carries information. I have already made this point at some length in Chapter 7 on the self. The portion of the environmental layout that is hidden by the body is continually interchanging with the unhidden remainder as the head turns and the body moves.

The difference between the way a horse perceives its environment and the way a human does is therefore not so profound as you might assume. The blind region caused by the head and body of the horse is a small part of the ambient array, whereas the blind region caused by the head of a human is a large part, in fact, a visual solid angle of about 180°, approximating a hemisphere of the array But it is not actually a blind region, of course; it is the head. A small turn of the head enables the horse to see what is behind, and a large turn of the head enables a person to see what is behind, but in both cases the observer sees himself in the middle of an environment. Are you doubtful that a horse can see itself? Why shouldn't the horse see itself just as much as the human does, if vision yields proprioception as well as exteroception? The horse's blind area is differently shaped than the human's-the boundaries of its field of view are different-but the blind area means the same thing to the horse as it does to the human. Egoreception and exteroception are inseparable kinds of experience. The seeing of oneself is not a complex intellectual experience but a simple primitive one. The orthodox dogma that no animal but the human animal has self-consciousness is surely false.

With What Does One See the World?

We human observers take it for granted that one sees the environment with one's eyes. The eyes are the organs of vision just as the ears are the organs of hearing, the nose is the organ of smelling, the mouth is the organ of tasting, and Looking with the Head and Eyes 195

the skin is the organ of touching. The eye is considered to be an instrument of the mind, or an organ of the brain. But the truth is that each eye is positioned in a head that is in turn positioned on a trunk that is positioned on legs that maintain the posture of the trunk, head, and eyes relative to the surface of support. Vision is a whole perceptual system, not a channel of sense (Gibson, 19666). One sees the environment not with the eyes but with the eyes-in-the- head-on-the-body-resting-on-the-ground. Vision does not have a seat in the body in the way that the mind has been thought to be seated in the brain.The perceptual capacities of the organism do not lie in discrete anatomical parts of the body but lie in systems with nested functions.

Even so, it might be argued, one surely looks with the eyes even if one does not see with the eyes. But looking with the eyes alone is mere looking at, not looking around. It is the scanning of an object, a page of print, or a picture. One also looks with the head, not just with the eyes, more exactly with the head-eye system, as I said at the outset.

The exclusive concern with eye turning to the neglect of head turning is one of the deep errors of the snapshot theory of vision and goes back at least a century. Helmholtz asserted in Physiological Optics that"the intent of vision is to see as distinctly as possible various objects or parts of an object in succession. This is accomplished by so pointing the eyes that an image of the given object is projected on the fovea of each retina. The governing of the ocular move- ments is wholly subordinated to this end; both eyes are adjusted and accom- modated together so as to permit this light absorptive pointing. Any...eye 196 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

movement not having for its end the attaining of distinct imaging of an object cannot be performed"(Helmholtz, trans. 1925，p. 56). He assumed that objects and parts of objects are what we perceive and that these are limited to obiects in the fixed field of view. He would be astonished at the assertion that a man perceives his surroundings, including the environment behind his head, for that is not "the intent of vision."

The Awareness of the Environment and the Ego

Despite what Helmholtz said, some psychologists have insisted that a man is aware of the environment behind his head. Koffka was one who did so. Phenomenal space, he said, extends to the sides; yonder is the wall of the room and there are walls to the right and left, but phenomenal space also extends behind. You would be vividly aware of the space behind if the edge of a cliff were there. "Behavioral space does not confront me but encloses me." What is it that lies between the "in front" and the "behind"? It is, he says, "just that phenom- enal object we call the Ego." It is a segregated object, like others in phenomenal space (Koffka, 1935, p. 322). It is only a step from this description to the theory that the head and body of the observer hide the surfaces of the world that are outside the occluding edges of the field of view. Koffka made no reference to head turning and failed to recognize the interchange of the hidden and the unhidden, and that is an important step, but he did recognize a fact of perception.

When I distinguished, years ago, between the visual field as one kind of experience and the visual world as a radically different kind (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 3), I was elaborating on Koffka. The visual field, I suggested, consists of a patchwork of colors something like a picture, whereas the visual world consists of familiar surfaces and obiects one behind another. The visual field has bound- aries, roughly oval in shape, and it extends about 180 from side to side and about 140° up and down. The boundaries are not sharp, but they are easily observed when attended to. The visual world, however, has no such boundaries; it is unbounded, like the surface of a sphere extending all the way around me. The visual field is clear in the center and vague in the periphery-that is, less definite toward the boundaries-but the visual world has no such center of definition and is everywhere clear. The oval boundaries of the visual field sweep across the array whenever I turn my head and wheel over the array whenever I tilt my head, but the visual world is perfectly stationary and always upright. The patchwork of the visual field deforms as I move and, in particular, Hows outward from a center when I move in the direction of that center. but the phenomenal surfaces of the world are always perfectly rigid.

The visual field is a special kind of experience that can arise from a sample of the ambient array taken with the head and eyes fixed. In its purest form, the visual field arises with a single fixed eye. The visual world is the kind of exper- ience that arises naturally from the whole ambient array when one is looking Looking with the Head and Eyes 197

around and looking with two eyes at two slightly different points of observa- tion. The field of view of the two eyes is a sort of mixed cross-section of the overlapping solid angles registered by the eyes. The field of one eye would correspond to a plane picture cutting the solid angle for that eye. It would correspond in the sense that a faithful picture could be substituted for the angular sample so as to yield almost the same phenomenal experience. But the visual world is a kind of experience that does not correspond to anything, not any possible picture, not any motion picture, and not even any "panoramic"motion picture. The visual world is not a projection of the ecological world. How could it be? The visual world is the outcome of the picking up of invariant informa- tion in an ambient optic array by an exploring visual system, and the awareness of the observer's own body in the world is a part of the experience.

The awareness of "out there" and of "here" are complementary. The occluding boundary of the field of view constitutes "here." The content and details of the field of view are "out there,"and the smaller the detail the farther away it is.

The Visual Ego

Ecological optics distinguishes between an unoccupied point of observation in the medium and an occupied point (Chapter 7). The former is a position where an observer might be situated and the latter is a position where an observer is situated. The ambient optic array is then altered, for it includes a solid angle filled by the observer, having a boundary that is unique to the observer's partic- ular anatomy. It is called the blind region in physiological optics. But it is blind only for exteroception, not for proprioception. It looks like oneself. Its shape depends on the shape of one's nose, the shape of one's head, and the shape of one's limbs. It is altered when a person puts on eyeglasses or when a horse is made to wear blinders. Thus, whenever a point of observation is occupied, the occupier is uniquely specified, whether adult or child, monkey or dog.

TERMINOLOGICAL NOTE

I should never have entitled my 1950 book The Perception of the Visual World,

for it has promoted confusion. A better title would have been The Visual

Perception of the World. The term visual world should be reserved for the

awareness of the environment obtained by vision.

An observer perceives the position of here relative to the environment and also his body as being here. His limbs protrude into the field of view, and even his nose is a sort of protuberance into the field. Undoubtedly, the length of a 198 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

man's nose determines how he sees himself. (Consider the ego of a baboon in this respect, and think what the ego of an elephant would be!) For us, the nose is the leftward edge of the right eye's field of view and the rightward edge of the left eye's field of view. Hence, it yields a kind of subjective sensation called a double image in the theory of binocular vision, in fact, the maximum limit of crossed diplopia. It would therefore be a theoretical zero for the dimension of distance from here.

Since the occupied point of observation is normally a moving position, not a stationary one, the animal sees its body moving relative to the ground. It sees that part of the environment toward which it is moving; it sees the movements of its feet, relative to its body and also over the ground. When it looks around during locomotion, it sees the turning of its head. These are all cases of visual kinesthesis.

The Persisting Environment: Persistence, Coexistence,

and Concurrence

To say that one is aware of the environment behind one's head is to say that one is aware of the persistence of the environment. Things go out of sight and come into sight as the head turns in looking around, but they persist while out of sight. Whatever leaves the field as one turns to the right re-enters the field as one turns to the left. The structure that is deleted is later accreted; this is a reversible transition, and therefore the structure can be said to be invariant under the transition. To pick up the invariant is to perceive the persistence of a surface, so my argument runs. If this is true, there is no need to appeal to a concept of "object permanence" or to any theory of how the concept might develop.

THE INFORMATION FOR PERSISTENCE

The perceiving of the persistence of the environment is not, of course, an

achievement of the visual system alone. It is a nonmodal form of perception,

cutting across the perceptual systems and transcending the "senses."Touching

and listening accompany looking. The young child who goes for a walk and

looks around at the strange wide world can cling to the mother's hand,

confirming her persistence while she is temporarily out of sight. Similarly, the

persistence of the mother when she goes around the corner, or goes out of

sight in the dark, is confirmed by hearing her voice. The information to specify

the continued existence of something may be carried by touch or sound as

well as by light. Incessant stimulation is not necessary for the perceiving of

persistence. Looking with the Head and Eyes 199

To perceive the persistence of surfaces that are out of sight is also to perceive their coexistence with those that are in sight. In short, the hidden is continuous with the unhidden; they are connected.

Separated places and objects are perceived to coexist. This means that separ- ated events at these places are perceived to be concurrent. What happens at one end of a corridor is seen to co-occur with what happens at the other end, even though one must look back and forth between the two. Different concurrent events, thus, can be sampled in succession without destroying their concur- rence, just as different coexisting places can be sampled in succession without destroying their coexistence.

How Does the Eye-Head System Work? Outline of a New Theory Looking-around and looking-at are acts that naturally go together, but they can be studied separately. In fact, looking-at has been studied almost exclusively by visual physiologists. What they have recorded and measured are so-called eye movements, that is, movements of the eyes relative to the head. The head is usually fixed in an apparatus. The eyes are then allowed to scan a display of some sort within the field of view of the stationary head, a pattern of luminous points in the dark, or a line of print on a page, or a picture. The eyes rotate in rapid jumps from one fixation to another, and these are called saccadic movements. In terms of the retinal image theory, the fovea of each retina is moved so that an image of the particular "object of interest" falls on the retinal point of highest acuity where the photoreceptors, the cones, are most densely packed together. The anatomical fovea corresponds to the psychological "center of clearest vision." The fine details of the optical image are said to be best "resolved"at the fovea. All this is implied in the quotation from Helmholtz, above.

The Recognized Types of Eye Movement

There are other kinds of ocular movements besides scanning, however, and the accepted classification goes back to R. Dodge (1903), who was the first invest- igator to record and measure them by photography. They have since been studied with ever-increasing ingenuity and precision, but Dodge's list has never been challenged by physiologists. He never doubted the eye-camera analogy; he only forced us to consider that the eyes were movable cameras at the ends of fHlexible cables leading to the brain. The list is approximately as given below.

1. Fixation: Not strictly a"movement,"fixation is nevertheless an important kind of ocular behavior. It should be called a posture of the eye, a pointing at.

2. Saccadic movement: A saccadic movement is a rapid rotation of the eyeball from one fixation to another. It has long been taken for granted that the move- ment is a response of the eye muscles to a stimulus at the periphery of the retina 200 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

such as to bring that stimulus to the center of the retina, the fovea. But I shall challenge this assumption.

3. Pursuit movement: This kind of movement is said to be fixation of the eye on a moving object in the world, often nowadays called tracking. It is much slower than a saccadic movement.

4. Convergence and divergence: Convergence is the inward rotation of each eye so as to permit both eyes to fixate on the same near object. Divergence is the opposite, a return of the ocular axes to parallel so as to permit both eyes to fixate on the same distant object. In retinal image optics, it is assumed that these movements occur so that the two similar but more or less disparate images of the object can be "fused" in the brain to yield a single phenomenal object with depth. They are said to be governed by what is called a fusion reflex, but this is not consistent with the notion of a reflex as a response to a stimulus. Note that in both saccadic and pursuit movements the two eyes fixate together and rotate together as if they were linked. They are said to be conjugated. But they rotate in opposite directions during the vergence movements. All three types of movement, however, can be said to work in the interest of fixation.

5. Compensatory movement: This movement is quite different from the others. Like them, it is a rotation of each eye in the head but in precisely the opposite direction from that of the head, and to exactly the same degree. It compensates for the turning of the head. Thus, it is a nonmotion of the eyes relative to the environ- ment, a posture, like fixation. Anyone can note how exact this compensation normally is by looking at one eye in his mirror image and then moving his head around, left and right, up and down; the eye never swerves from its fixed orient- ation in space. It is as if anchored to the environment. When the head starts, the eye starts; when the head stops, the eye stops.

If the head turns through an angle too great for compensation, the eye jumps rapidly to a new orientation and holds it. Thus, a man on a mountaintop who turns around completely, taking several seconds for the act, keeps his eyes anchored to the dual ambient array for the whole period except for a small part of the time, totaling only a fraction of a second, during which the jumps have occurred. This is what happens in "looking around," and the result is a vivid perception of the whole environment. This is the natural exploratory activity of the visual system.

What experimenters do, however, is to put the subject in a rotating chair and turn him passively. In this unnatural situation a reflex response of the eyes is aroused to the stimulus of acceleration in the semicircular canals of the inner ear. It is called nystagmus. The compensatory turning of the eyes then has a certain latency; it does not begin with the turning of the head as does the compensatory turning of the eyes with an active head movement. The latter is not a reflex to a stimulus but a coordination. The head turning and the eye turning are concurrent movements of a single act. The active turning of the head involves the opposite turning of the eyes in much the same way that the Looking with the Head and Eyes 201

contracting of the extensor muscles of a limb involves the relaxing of the flexor muscles. The neck muscles and the eye muscles are innervated at the same time, reciprocally. But the passive movement of the eyes in response to a passive movement of the head has received by far the most attention from experi- menters. Physiologists are preoccupied with reflexes to stimuli, probably because they assume that reflexes are basic for behavior.

Experiments on ocular nystagmus with passive rotation often bring about a kind of disorientation of the eyes to the environment called vertigo. After stopping such rotation, the eyes will compensate for a nonexistent turning of the head. The experimenter has overstrained the capacity of the system. The observer reports that the world seems to be going around and usually that he feels as if his body were also being rotated. These two experiences are inconsistent. He usually just says that he is dizzy. He is at any rate disoriented to the environment: he cannot point to things, he will stagger, and somtimes fall down. I have described the limitations of the vestibular apparatus in my chapter on the basic orienting system(Gibson, 19666, Ch. 4.). The study of dizziness, however interesting and important for neurology, tells us nothing about the normal working of the eye- head system. I would explain it by saying that the normal complementarity of exteroception and proprioception has broken down.

A Reconsideration of Eye Movements

Ecological optics as distinguished from eyeball optics calls for a re-examination of the traditional eye movements. We must consider how the visual system works, not just how the eyes move. Eyeball optics is appropriate for visual physiology and the prescribing of eyeglasses but not for the psychology of visual perception. Fixation

The prolonged fixing of the eyes on an "object or part of an object,"the bringing of its image to the fovea and keeping it there, does not occur in life. It is a laboratory artifice, brought about when an experimenter tells an observer to stare at a "fixation point"that is usually of no interest to her. No one stares at a fixed point in the world for long unless she is so preoccupied that she is actually not seeing what she looks at. Seeming exceptions arise in the aiming of a rifle or the threading of a needle, but these are actually cases where different objects are aligned, not where a single object is fixated. The eyes normally search, explore, or scan, and there are seldom fewer than several saccadic jumps per second. They look at but do not fixate.

Even when fixation is artificially prolonged in the laboratory, it turns out not to be pure fixation, a steady posture. The eye is never literally fixed. It undergoes a series of miniature movements or microsaccades. The recording of such eye movements has become very precise in recent years, and the evidence now 202 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

suggests that looking at a tiny thing consists of making tiny movements. If so, looking is always exploring, even so-called fixating. On the smallest scale, the eyes could never be perfectly steady, for the eye muscles that control their posture undergo tremor and the eyes tremble in the same way that the hand does when you hold it out. There does not seem to be any clear separation between large saccades, small saccades, microsaccades, and tremor. Perhaps the general conclu- sion should be that an eye-posture is nothing but movements that are very small.

This conclusion is consistent with my conception of the ambient optic array. It consists of adjacent visual solid angles that are nested, each solid angle having its base in a feature or face or facet of the environmental layout, the features being themselves nested in superordinate and subordinate units. The eyes can explore the large details of large solid angles. And the eye-head system can explore the hemispheric solid angles of the sky and the earth or of the mountains to the east and the valley to the west. We perceive a large mural painting with sweeps of the eyes. We perceive a page of print with small saccades. And one puts a thread into the eye of a needle with the tiniest saccades of all.

Saccadic Movement

The jump of the eyeball from one fixation to another, it seems, can vary from an angle of many degrees to one of a few minutes of arc or less. So, just as there is no pure fixation, there is also no pure movement. There are postures of the eyes that are relatively stable and movements of the eyes from one such posture to another, but they grade into each other. Moving and fixating are comple- mentary. They combine in the act of scanning.

It is certainly a fallacy to assume that a saccadic movement is a response to a "stimulus"on the periphery of the retina that brings it to the fovea. There are no stimuli in an optic array. That assumption comes from experiments in which a point of light is flashed on in utter darkness; the eyes then turn so as to foveate it, but this experimental situation does not apply to everyday vision. Visual physiologists, however, presuppose an array of stimuli and assume that a localizing movement, a "fixation reflex," tends to occur for each retinal point when it is stimulated.

It is also a fallacy, if a little more plausible, to assume that a series of fixations is a series of acts of selective attention to the different objects in the world. Each fixation would then be a centering of foveal attention on one object to the exclusion of other objects. Each saccade must then be a movement of attention from one object to another. But the truth is that attention is not only selective, it is also integrative. Attention can be distributed as well as being concentrated. The awareness of details is not inconsistent with the awareness of wholes. Each in fact implies the other. One can perfectly well pay attention to some aspect of the environment that extends over a large angle of the ambient array, such as Looking with the Head and Eyes 203

the gradient of the ground that goes all the way from one's feet out to the horizon. Hence, a whole series of fixations can be a single act of attention.

Pursuit Movement

Not just a fixation of the eyes on a moving object in the world, pursuit move- ment is also, and usually, an adjustment of the ocular system to the flowing ambient array during locomotion of the observer. The centrifugal outflow of the optic array from the direction in which one is traveling must be attended to in order to see where one is going, and in order to control one's locomotion. The eyes are pointed at one element of the flowing array so that all the other elements of the flow pattern that fall into lawful relationships to it can be picked up. This is what happens when you drive your car down the road: your eyes fix on a piece of the layout and track it downward, then jump ahead to a new piece. These drifts and jumps are somewhat similar to the compensatory nystagmus with head turning, but the drifts during locomotion are not the same as the drifts during compensation.

Convergence and Divergence

Retinal image optics assumes that if one object in space has an image in each of the two eyes the two images have to be fused into one picture in the brain. It further assumes that convergence or divergence of the eyes somehow works in the interests of this fusion process. If the physiological images were not combined or unified, we should see two objects instead of one. Ecological optics makes no such assumptions, rejecting the very idea of a physiological image transmitted to the brain. It supposes that two eyes have no more difficulty in perceiving one object than two hands do in feeling one object, or than two ears do in perceiving one event. The dual ocular system registers both the matching of structure between the optic arrays at the different points of observation of the two eyes and the perspective mismatch of their structure, both the congruence and the disparity, at the same time. The two eyes are not two channels of sensation but a single system. The converging and diverging of the eyes presumably work in the interests of picking up the congruity/disparity information.

Note that two arrays could not possibly be fused in the sense of being united in one location. Neither could two optical images be mixed or combined. They do not need to be. The fallacy of the traditional theory comes from supposing that two physiological images have to be fused in the brain, as if one picture were picked up and superposed on the other and then compared, in the manner of a photographer who puts one transparent film on top of another and looks to see if they match. The error is to assume that a unitary mental image can only arise from a unitary brain image, a process in the brain that occurs in one locus. 204 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The human binocular system extracts the similarities of structure between two arrays, I suggest, just as each eye extracts the invariants of structure in its own array. Varying convergence of the binocular system is a kind of exploration, like the varying fixation of each monocular system. The dual array is available for exploration just as much as the single array is. The difference in perspective structure between two arrays is the same as the change in perspective structure of one array when one eye moves sideways through the interocular distance. This disparity is neither identity at one extreme nor discrepancy at the other. If the structures were completely identical, nothing would be specified but a hypothetical and ecologically impossible surface called a horopter. If the structures were completely discrepant, another kind of impossibility would be specified, and this discrepancy can actually be imposed on the binocular system with a device called a haploscope. For example, the array to one eye may consist of vertical stripes and the array to the other of horizontal stripes. In this case the binocular system fails, and the use of one eye is suppressed. The system becomes monocular. Typically, the suppression shifts from one eye to the other, and the result is called binocular rivalry. You see horizontal stripes or vertical stripes, or horizontal in one part of the field and vertical in the other, but never horizontal stripes and vertical stripes in the same place at the same time.

This kind of contradiction is very interesting. It is not logical contradiction of the sort that philosophers have studied since Aristotle. It might be called ecological contradiction. It is a discrepancy of information. There will be more about this in Chapter 14 on depiction.

ON BINOCULAR DISPARITY

The idea of disparity between two arrays is quite new. It is not the same as

the old idea of disparity between two retinal images defined by noncorres-

ponding points on two retinas considered as receptive mosaics. Array

disparity rests on ecological optics instead of on physiological optics.

The application of the new optics to binocular disparity has been worked

out by Barrand (1978). Although anticipated by the gestalt theorists in the

assumption that binocular disparity was "relational," it is a departure from

the classical theory of stereopsis. It can handle the neglected fact of occluding

edges in stereopsis, for example, which the classical theory cannot.

Compensatory Movement

When we consider the ambient optic array at the point of observation occupied by an eye instead of the retinal image of an object formed in the eye by light rays, we begin to understand the purpose of the compensatory eye-head Looking with the Head and Eyes 205

FIGURE 12.2 The turning of the eyes in the head to compensate for the turning of the head in the world.

As the head turns to the right, the eyes turn to the left through the same angle. In this diagram the eyes are converged. (From The Perception of the Visual World by James Jerome Gibson and used with the agreement of the reprint publisher, Greenwood Press, Inc.)

coordination. Its purpose is to keep the eye oriented to the unchanging features of the environment for as much of the time as possible while the observer looks around and gets about. It prevents both eyes from wandering or drifting aimlessly. They are linked to the layout of the surfaces. Only if they are stable relative to the world can they look at the world. The eyes do tend to drift or wander when the ambient light is homogeneous, as it is in the presence of an unstructured total field like the blue sky or a dense fog or in ambient darkness. The compensation is automatic, but it is not a reflex response to a stimulus. If the eyes were not anchored, the phenomenal world would "swing"instead of being the fixed frame of reference it is. Indeed, the experience of vertigo does arise whenever the coordinate compensation breaks down after the stopping of prolonged passive rotation in a swivel chair.

The so-called swinging of the scene can be artificially induced in another way when the structure of the field of view of the eye is distorted or reversed by a prism or lens attached to the head by a spectacle frame. The field of view no longer sweeps over the ambient array in the normal manner when the head turns. Thus, the compensatory eye movements no longer serve their purpose, for the sampling of the array by head turning has been disturbed. The eyes are no longer anchored to the environment. The results of experiments on percep- tion when distorting spectacles are worn can only be understood in the light of this fact (Kohler, 1964). 206 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Other Adjustments of The Visual System

The movements and postures of the eye-head system have now been described. But vision is a highly tuned and elaborate mode of perception, and several other kinds of adjustment occur in the activity of looking. The eyes blink, the tear glands secrete, the pupils enlarge or contract, the lens accommodates, and the retina adjusts for either daytime or nighttime illumination. All these adjust- ments subserve the pickup of information.

Eye-blinking

The eyelids close and reopen at intervals during waking hours to keep the transparent surface of the cornea washed clean and prevent it from drying out. The retina is of course deprived of stimulation during these brief moments of eye-closing, but the interesting fact is that no sensation of darkening is noticed, although even the briefest dimming of the illumination when the electric light falters is noticed. The explanation, perhaps, is simply that this particular kind of flicker is propriospecific. A dimming obtained with an eye-blink is experi- enced as an eye-blink; a dimming imposed by the illumination is experienced as coming from the world.

The ordinary eye-blink is not a triggered reflex. It may sometimes be stim- ulated by a puff of air or a cinder on the cornea, but it usually operates to prevent stimulation, not to respond to it. Like the closing of the eyes during sleep, it is an adjustment.

The eyelids work in cooperation with the tear glands. The reason for keeping the surface of the cornea clear is (by analogy with a windshield wiper)that dirt or foreign particles reduce its transparency. The structure of the optic array when the air is clear can be extremely fine, and these very small solid angles specify both the small-scale structure of the near environment and the large- scale structure of the far environment. A dirty cornea still admits light to the eye but degrades the information in the array of light.

The Accommodation of the Lens

The combined cornea and lens of the eye constitute a lens system that is said to focus an image of an object on the retina, in accordance with the classical theory formulated by Johannes Kepler. To each radiating point on the near surface of the object there corresponds, ideally, one focus point in the retinal image. The function of the lens is to make it a true point instead of a "blur circle,"whatever the distance of the object. The lens accommodates for distance and minimizes the blur (Chapter 4).

The theory of ambient light and its structure is not consistent with this, or at least I do not now understand how it could be made consistent. The notion Looking with the Head and Eyes 207

of nested solid angles based on a nested layout of surfaces, the solid angles being ever changing and never frozen, is of a different order from the notion of radi- ation from the atoms of a surface and the bringing to a focus of a pencil of these rays from each point of the surface. I do not understand how the former notion could be reduced to the latter, for they are in different realms of discourse

The focusing of the lens of a photographic camera for a given distance or range of distances is not as similar to the accommodating of the lens of an eye as we have been taught. There is just enough similarity to make optometry and the prescribing of eyeglasses a useful technology. But the eye's lens works as part of the exploratory mechanism of the visual system, along with fixation and conver- gence, and nothing in the photographic camera is comparable to this. Photographic film does not scan, or look at, or pick up disparity. We are so accustomed to think of deficiencies in accommodation in terms of an acuity chart that we tend to forget this fact. Distinct vision with a fixated eye is not the only test for good visual perception, but that is all the optometrist tries to measure.

The function of the retina is to register invariants of structure, not the points of an image. The point-to-point correspondence of the theory of image formation does not apply. Ecological optics will have to explain the action of the ocular lens in a different way than does classical geometrical optics. The explanation is not simple.

The Adjustment of the Pupil

In Chapter 4, I distinguished carefully between stimulus energy and stimulus information, between ambient light and the ambient array. Light as energy is necessary if the photochemicals in the photoreceptors of the retina are to react, but light as a structural array is necessary if the visual system is to pick up information about the world. Although a clear distinction should be made, it must not be forgotten that stimulus information is carried by stimulus energy. There is no information in utter darkness. And, at the other extreme, percep- tion fails in blazing illumination. The photoreceptors are then swamped by the intense light, and the information cannot be extracted by the perceptual system. We describe the accompanying sensation as dazzle, and it is propriospecific. The contracting of the pupil of the eye is an adjustment that reduces the tend- ency of the photoreceptors to be overwhelmed by excessive stimulation.

Physiological optics, concerned with receptors and stimulus energy, is adequate to explain the pupillary adjustment. Ecological optics, concerned with perceptual organs and the information in light, is not required. The different levels of optics correspond to different levels of activity in the visual system. It should nevertheless be noted that the contraction of the pupil in strong illumin- ation and its enlargement in weak illumination work in the interests of inform- ation pickup. And the continuous adjustment of pupil size to light intensity is not a series of responses to stimuli but an optimizing process. 208 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The Dark Adaptation of the Retina

One kind of adjustment of the retina to the level of illumination involves no movement at all. This is a shift between the functioning of one set of photore- ceptors and another set containining different photochemicals and with a different level of sensitivity. We have what is called a duplex retina, and the duplicity theory of the retina is one of the triumphs of the study of vision at the cellular level. The cones provide for daylight vision and the rods for night vision. The shift of function from cones to rods and the reverse is supple- mentary to the adjustment of the pupil, which by itself is insufficient for the million-to-one intensity difference between daylight and nightlight.

I have described the advantages of a night retina, a day retina, and a duplex retina in the chapter on the evolution of the visual system in The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 9). Animals of our sort are able to perceive well enough in either a brightly or a dimly lighted environ- ment and thus do not have to make a choice between a diurnal and a nocturnal way of life.

Conclusion: The Functions of the Visual System

The anatomical parts of the visual system are, approximately, the body, the head, the eyes, the appurtenances of an eye (eyelid, pupil, and lens), and finally the retina of an eye, which is composed of photocells and nerve cells. The body includes all the other parts, and the cell includes none of the others. All these components are connected with the nervous system, and all are active. All are necessary for visual perception. Both the parts and their activities form a hier- archy of organs. At the top is the body, then the head, and then the eyes. Being equipped with muscles, the parts can move, each in its own way-the eyes relative to the head, the head relative to the body. and the body relative to the environment. Hence, all move relative to the environment, and I suggested that their purpose is perceptual exploration. At the level of the single eye, the eylid wipes, the lens accommodates, and the pupil adjusts. Muscles are also required for these activities, but they are not bodily movements in the sense used above. At the bottom level, the retina and its cells adapt to external conditions but the activity of the retina does not depend on muscles. At all levels the activities are adjustments of the system instead of reflex reactions to stimuli, or "motor'" responses, or responses of any kind, for that matter.

The body explores the surrounding environment by locomotion; the head explores the ambient array by turning; and the eyes explore the two samples of the array, the fields of view, by eye movements. These might be called explor- atory adjustments. At the lower levels, eyelid, lens, pupil, and retinal cells make what might be called optimizing adjustments. Both the global structure and the fine structure of an array constitute information. The observer needs to look Looking with the Head and Eyes 209

around, to look at, to focus sharply, and to neglect the amount of light. Perception needs to be both comprehensive and clear. The visual system hunts for comprehension and clarity. It does not rest until the invariants are extracted. Exploring and optimizing seem to be the functions of the system.

The Fallacy of the Stimulus Sequence Theory

The traditional assumption has been that we perceive the world by means of a sequence of stimuli. When we look at the scene in front of us, we see it in a succes- sion of glimpses analogous to snapshots, each glimpse corresponding to a pure fixation. Similarly, when we look around at the whole environment, we perceive it as a sequence of visual fields analogous to pictures, each field corresponding to a posture of the head. Both the glimpses and the pictures of the world have been vaguely identified with retinal images. But this assumption that we perceive in a sequence of pictures, either glimpses or fields, is quite false.

THE LORGNETTE TACHISTOSCOPE

I once devised a sort of test of what perception would be like if it really

consisted of a sequence of snapshots. I mounted the shutter of a camera on

a handle so that it could be held close to one eye and triggered with a finger,

giving a wide-angle glimpse of the environment for a fifth of a second or less.

The other eye was covered. The subject was led up to a table on which was

a collection of familiar objects and told to keep looking until he knew what

was there. Because he couldn't scan the table with his eye, he had to scan

with his head and trigger the shutter for each new fixation.

Perception was seriously disturbed, and the task was extremely difficult.

What took only a few seconds with normal looking required many fixations

with the lorgnette tachistoscope, and there were many errors. I now begin to

understand why.

A visual fixation is not at all comparable to a snapshot, that is, a momentary exposure. The eye has no shutter. The eye scans over the field. The fovea is transposed over the sample of the array, and the structure of the array remains invariant. Not even a visual field at a head-posture is comparable to a picture in a sequence of pictures (although I used to think it was). The field sweeps over the ambient array with progressive gain and loss at its leading and trailing edges, and the ambient structure remains invariant. No succession of discrete images occurs, either in scanning or in looking around.

The transposition of the fovea over the sample of the array and the sweeping of the edges of the field of view over the ambient array are propriospecific; they 210 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

specify eye turning and head turning respectively, which is precisely what they should do. The former is visual kinesthesis for an eve movement, and the latter is visual kinesthesis for a head movement.

The formula of visual kinesthesis for the exploratory movements of the eyes, and of the head and eyes together, resolves a number of long-standing puzzles concerning visual sensations. It cuts a Gordian knot. The century-old problem of why the world does not seem to move when the eyes move and the analogous problem of why the room does not appear to go around when one looks around are unnecessary. They only arise from the assumption that visual stimuli and visual sensations are the elements of visual perception. If the visual system is assumed instead to detect its own movements along with extracting the inform- ation about the world from the ambient light, the puzzles disappear. I shall have more to say about this later.

The false problems stem from the false analogy between photography and visual perception that everyone has taken for granted. A photograph is an arrested moment of a changing array. The film has to be exposed, and the so-called latent image must be developed, fixed, and printed before it becomes a picture. But there is nothing even faintly comparable to a latent image in the retina. It is misleading enough to compare the eye with a camera, but it is even worse to compare the retina with a photographic film.

The stimulus-sequence theory of perception underlies much of modern thought, not only the thinking of philosophers, psychologists, and physiologists but that of the man in the street. It is reinforced by comic strips and cartoons and news photographs, and the movies above all. As children we do learn much about the world at second hand from picture sequences, so much that we are strongly tempted to interpret firsthand experience in the same way. Everybody knows what pictures are, and textbooks tell us that retinal images are pictures. I said so myself in my book on the visual world, and the only problem that bothered me was how a sequence of images could be converted into a scene (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 8，pp. 158 ff.). I did realize that something was wrong with this assertion, but it took me years to detect the fallacy.

The Theory of the Conversion of a Sequence into a Scene

It sounds plausible to assert that a sequence of images is converted into a scene. "At the circus, for example, you may watch the tightrope walker, then look at the performing seals, pause to observe a clown, and return to the tightrope walker. Although you have had a succession of impressions the events are perceived as coexisting"(Gibson, 1950b, p. 158). You are aware of three concur- rent events in three different places, all going on at the same time, but you are not aware of the successive order in which they have been fixated. An adjacent order of places, a whole scene, must have been obtained from a successive order of sensory inputs, a sequence, by some sort of conversion. The sequence of smaller Looking with the Head and Eyes 211

fixations with which you observe the tightrope walker in his smaller situation is noticed even less. You look back and forth between his feet and his hands, say, but what you see is the whole act.

The hypothesis of conversion is consistent with the traditional theory that successive inputs of a sensory nerve are processed, that a series of signals is inter- preted, or that the incoming data of sense are operated on by the mind. Sensations are converted into perceptions, and the question is, how does this come about? In the case of successive retinal images, the process is supposed to be that of memory. It may be called short-term or primary memory, or immediate memory as distinguished from long-term memory, but the basic assumption is that each image has to be held over, or stored in some sense, in order for the sequence to be integrated, that is, combined into a unit. The present percept is nothing without past percepts, but past percepts cannot combine with the present except as memories. Every item of experience has to be carried forward into the present in order to make possible perception in the present. Memories have to accumulate. This is the traditional theory of memory made explicit. It is full of difficulties, but it has seemed to provide the only explanation of how images could be integrated.

The error was to suppose in the first place that perception of the environment is based on a sequence of discrete images. If it is based instead on invariance in a flow of stimulation, the problem of integration does not arise. There is no need to unify or combine different pictures if the scene is in the sequence, is specified by the invariant structure that underlies the samples of the ambient array.

The problem of explaining the experience of what I once called the unbounded visual world (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 8) or what I would now call the surrounding environment is a false problem. The retinal image is bounded, to be sure, and the foveal image has even smaller bounds, but the ambient array is unbounded. If the stimulation of the retina, or that of the fovea, is accepted as basic, another problem arises as well, how to explain the experience of a stable visual world. The stimulation of the retina is continually shifting, but this is also a false problem, for the structure of the ambient array is quite stable.

Summary

One sees the environment not just with the eyes but with the eyes in the head on the shoulders of a body that gets about. We look at details with the eyes, but we also look around with the mobile head, and we go-and-look with the mobile body.

A theory of how the eye-head system works has been formulated in this chapter. A theory of how the system works during locomotion was formulated in the last chapter. The exploratory adjustments of the eye-head system (fixa- tion, saccadic movements, pursuit movements, convergence-divergence, and compensatory movements)are easier to understand. Even the optimizing 212 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

adjustments of the lens, the pupil, and the photoreceptors are more intelligible when we consider optical information instead of stimuli.

The flow of optical stimulation is not a sequence of stimuli or a series of discrete snapshots. If it were, the sequence would have to be converted into a scene. The flow is sampled by the visual system. And the persistence of the environment together with the coexistence of its parts and the concurrence of its events are all perceived together.
