## 0601. Events and the Information for Perceiving Events

So far, little has been said about change in the environment. The point of observation could change and the source of illumination could change, but the streams did not flow, the pebbles did not roll, the leaves did not fall, and the animals did not scurry about. The environment has been described as shaped and textured and colored, as well as illuminated by a moving sun, but as if frozen. Let us now bring the environment to life. We need to consider a world in which events can happen.

Ecological events, as distinguished from microphysical and astronomical events, occur at the level of substances and the surfaces that separate them from the medium. Substances differ in rigidity and thus in the degree to which their surfaces resist deformation. Between the surfaces of clouds at one extreme and of solid rock at the other are liquids, viscous substances, viscoelastic substances, and granular substances whose surfaces are intermediate between these extremes in their resistance to deformation. The reshaping of a surface requires force, the amount of force depending on the substance.

It will also be remembered that substances differ in chemical inertness, or the degree to which they resist reactions with agents like oxygen in the medium. The more inert a substance is, the more its surface and its composition will tend to persist. Substances also differ in their readiness to evaporate or sublimate, and this too affects the persistence of their surfaces.

The distinction between objects that are attached to the ground and those that are not should also be remembered in connection with ecological events. The detached object can be moved without breaking the continuity of its surface with another surface, but the attached object cannot. Note that an object can be resting on a surface of support, in contact with it, without being attached to it. These distinctions will be used in discussing motions as ecological events.

The laws of motion for bodies in space as formulated by Isaac Newton apply only to idealized detached objects. The falling apple that, according to legend, hit Newton on the head and led him to conceive the law of universal gravity was only an incident in a sequence of ecological events: as the seasons changed, the apple had to grow and ripen before it could fall, collide, and finally decay.

The surface of a substance is where a mechanical action like collision is located, where chemical reactions take place, where vaporization occurs, or solution, or diffusion into the medium. All these are ecological events.

Just what are we to mean by an ecological event? Is it possible to define and classify events? It ought to be attempted. For only if we know what we mean by an event can we describe the change in the ambient optic array that specifies it, and only then can we begin to study the perceiving of it. A good many psychologists have tried to experiment with the perception of what they vaguely call motion. A few, including the writer, have begun to do experiments on the perception of what they call events, but none has yet made a systematic ecolo- gical approach to the problem. Most of the existing experiments have been based on the assumption that the perception of motion depends on the motion of a spot of light across the retina, a sensation of motion, and the experimenters are preoccupied with the deep contradictions to which this assumption gives rise (Gibson, 1968b).

事件及其感知信息

到目前为止，我们对环境变化的讨论还很有限。虽然我们提到了观察点和光源可能发生变化，但我们描述的世界似乎是静止的 —— 溪流不流动，鹅卵石不滚动，树叶不飘落，动物也不四处奔走。我们描述了环境的形状、纹理和颜色，以及阳光如何照耀其上，但这个世界仿佛被定格了。现在，让我们为这个世界注入生机，考虑一个充满变化和事件的环境。

生态事件 (ecological events) 不同于微观物理现象或宏观天文现象，它们发生在物质表面以及物质与周围介质 (如空气或水) 的交界处。不同物质的硬度各异，因此它们的表面抵抗变形的能力也不同。从易变形的云层到坚硬的岩石，中间还有液体、粘性物质、粘弹性物质和颗粒状物质，它们的表面抗变形能力各不相同。要改变一个物体的表面形状，需要施加力，而所需的力取决于物质的性质。

此外，物质在化学稳定性上也有差异，也就是它们抵抗与环境中物质（如氧气）发生反应的能力不同。化学性质越稳定的物质，其表面和成分就越不容易发生变化。物质蒸发或升华的倾向也会影响其表面的持久性。

在讨论生态事件时，我们还需要区分固定在地面上的物体和可移动的物体。可移动的物体能够在不破坏其表面完整性的情况下被移动，而固定的物体则不能。值得注意的是，一个物体可以静置在支撑面上，与之接触，但并不一定固定在上面。这些区别在我们讨论运动作为生态事件时会很有用。

艾萨克·牛顿提出的运动定律只适用于理想化的独立物体。传说中启发牛顿发现万有引力定律的那个落在他头上的苹果，实际上只是一系列生态事件中的一个片段：随着季节更替，苹果需要经历生长、成熟，然后才能落下、碰撞，最后腐烂。

物质的表面是各种生态事件发生的场所，比如机械碰撞、化学反应、蒸发、溶解，或向周围介质扩散等。

那么，我们究竟该如何定义生态事件呢？是否可能对事件进行分类？这是一个值得探索的问题。只有当我们明确了事件的定义，我们才能描述指示该事件的环境光学信息的变化，进而研究人类如何感知这些事件。许多心理学家已经尝试研究他们笼统称之为「运动」的感知。一些研究者，包括本文作者，已经开始探索所谓「事件」的感知，但还没有人从系统的生态学角度来研究这个问题。现有的大多数实验都基于这样一个假设：运动感知取决于视网膜上光点的移动，即一种运动的感觉。然而，这个假设带来了许多深层次的矛盾，让研究者们倍感困扰 (Gibson, 1968b)。

### 6.1 A Classification of Terrestrial Events

The events we are concerned with are "external," so a displacement of the point of observation will be excluded, because it refers to the locomotion of a potential observer, not to the motion of a surface. The change of occlusion that usually goes with a displacement of the point of observation is a very peculiar optical event, because it has both objective reference and subjective reference at the same time. That is, the revealing and concealing of a surface depend on both the location of the surface and the location of the point of observation.

The events we are concerned with are mainly terrestrial, so the motion of the sun across the sky will be put aside, together with the peculiar motions of shadows that depend on it. We are now interested in events that occur quite independently of where the observer is and where the sun is.

What kinds of events can be said to occur, after these exclusions? Tentatively, it would seem that they can be divided into three main varieties: change in the layout of surfaces, change in the color and texture of surfaces, and change in the existence of surfaces. Change of layout is caused by forces; change of color and texture is caused by change in the composition of the substance; and change in the existence of a surface is caused by a change in the state of the substance. Consider them one by one.

地球事件的分类

在我们探讨的事件中，我们主要关注发生在我们周围环境中的「外部」变化，而不包括观察者自身位置的改变。这是因为观察者的移动虽然会改变他所看到的景象，但并不属于环境本身的变化。有趣的是，当观察者移动时，某些物体可能被遮挡或显露，这种现象既取决于物体的位置，也取决于观察者的位置，因此它同时具有客观和主观的特性。

我们主要关注地球上发生的事件，所以暂且不考虑太阳在天空中的运动，以及由此产生的阴影变化。我们现在要探讨的是那些不受观察者位置或太阳位置影响的事件。

排除了这些因素后，我们可以将地球上的事件大致分为三类：

1. 表面布局的变化
2. 表面颜色和纹理的变化
3. 表面存在与否的变化

表面布局的变化通常是由各种力的作用引起的；颜色和纹理的变化往往是物质成分改变的结果；而表面存在与否的变化则可能是由物质状态的转变导致的。让我们逐一深入探讨这些变化。

### 6.2 Change of Layout due to Complex Forces

A change of layout due to complex forces refers to any alteration of the shape of the surfaces of the environment, including the repositioning of detached objects by displacement. Among all the entities that make up the furniture of the earth, some are mobile and some are not. What we are most inclined to call motions are translations and rotations of detached objects —— the falling weight, the spinning top, the rolling ball, and the hurled missile. We learn about these from studying mechanics. But there are many other changes in the layout of surfaces that are even more significant: the flexible deformations of the surface of another animal, the rippling and pouring of water, the elastic and plastic changes of rubber and clay, and the breaking or rupturing of a surface. We are somewhat less inclined to call these changes motions, but they are nonetheless mechanical events caused by forces. They do not have the elegant simplicity of the motions of celestial bodies under the influence of the force of gravity, but they are lawful and they have a kind of higher-order simplicity at their proper level of analysis.

由复杂力引起的布局变化

当我们谈到由复杂力引起的布局变化时，我们指的是环境中物体表面形状的任何改变，包括可移动物体位置的变化。在我们身边的世界里，有些物体是可以移动的，而有些则是固定不变的。

我们最容易注意到的运动通常是那些独立物体的平移和旋转。比如：
- 苹果从树上掉落
- 陀螺在桌面上旋转
- 足球在草地上滚动
- 飞机在天空中飞行

这些运动形式是物理学，特别是力学研究的基础。

然而，还有许多其他类型的表面变化同样重要，甚至更加引人注目：
- 动物身体的柔软变形，如猫伸懒腰时肌肉的舒展
- 水面的波动和流水的奔涌，如海浪拍打岸边
- 橡皮筋的伸缩或粘土被捏塑时的形变
- 玻璃杯跌落地面时的碎裂

虽然我们可能不太倾向于将这些变化称为「运动」，但它们同样是由各种力引起的物理现象。这些变化虽然没有天体运动那样简单优雅的规律，但在适当的分析层面上，它们仍然遵循着一定的规律，展现出一种更高层次的和谐。理解这些复杂的变化，对我们认识周围的世界至关重要。

The above tabulation, although incomplete, is suggestive. It has to do with what might be called ecological mechanics, which is rather different from either celestial mechanics on the one hand or particle mechanics on the other, including thermodynamics. Carpenters and builders are familiar with this branch of physics, although it is not taught in school. The displacements and turns of detached objects can be classed as changes of layout because they are rearrangements of the furniture of the earth, not pure translations and rotations along and around the three axes of Cartesian coordinate space. The earth is the background of these motions. The terrestrial substratum is an absolute frame of reference for them, since it is itself never displaced or turned. The world does not move, not at this level of analysis. On this account the contemporaries of Copernicus were quite justifiably shocked when he tried to convince them that the world did move.

At this level of analysis, the deformations and disruptions of a surface are not reduced to the motions of elementary particles of matter, either. Stretching- relaxing, for example, is an event in its own right, not a set of events; it is not reduced to a set of interrelated displacements of the elements of a surface.

The subvarieties of events in the above table may, of course, occur in combination; animal locomotion, for example, consists of displacements and turns relative to the ground, but it is accomplished by deformations of the animal-object, such as the flexing and extending of its parts. A collision may occur between two elastic objects or between an elastic object and the ground, so that one displacement is immediately followed by another and a train of events arises. Or, in the case of a machine with moving parts, a configuration of concurrent events is established. Man has invented a great number of mechanical moving parts, each with its characteristic motion-the wheel, roller, crank, and gear; the lever, rocker, pendulum, and hinge; the piston, slide, pinion, escapement, and screw. Thus, when a complex machine is running there is a sort of hierarchy of concurrent events. But note that a machine is assembled from such parts, each of which is a detached object in present terminology. A living organism, in contrast, is not assembled from parts, and its members, although they move, constitute a different sort of hierarchy.

上面的分类虽然不够完整，但却给了我们很多启发。它涉及到一个我们可以称之为「生态力学」的领域，这个领域与我们熟知的天体力学和微观粒子力学（包括热力学）都有所不同。虽然这门学问并不在学校课程中，但木匠和建筑工人在日常工作中却经常运用到这方面的知识。在生态力学的视角下，我们周围物体的移动和旋转都可以被视为环境布局的变化。这里的「环境」就像是地球上的一个大舞台，而物体则是舞台上的道具。这些物体的运动并不是在一个抽象的三维空间中发生的，而是以地球作为背景。在这个层面上，地球就像是一个绝对静止的参照系，因为它本身并不会移动或旋转。这可能听起来有点奇怪，但在我们日常生活的尺度上，这种观点是很有道理的。这也解释了为什么当哥白尼提出地球是运动的时候，他的同时代人会感到如此震惊。

在生态力学的观点中，我们不需要把物体表面的变形或破坏简化为原子级别的运动。比如，当你看到一个气球被吹起又放气时，我们可以直接把这个「膨胀-收缩」过程作为一个整体来研究，而不需要去考虑气球表面每个微小部分的运动。

生态力学中的各种事件常常是相互关联的。举个例子，当一只猫在移动时，它不仅在地面上位移和转向，同时它的身体也在不断地变形 —— 肌肉的伸展和收缩，关节的弯曲和伸直。再比如，当两个弹性物体相撞时，一个物体的运动会立即引起另一个物体的运动，形成一连串的事件。在人造机器中，我们能看到更复杂的运动组合。人类发明了许多具有特定运动方式的机械部件，比如：
- 旋转类：轮子、滚筒、曲柄、齿轮
- 往复类：杠杆、摇杆、钟摆、铰链
- 直线运动类：活塞、滑块
- 特殊运动类：小齿轮、擒纵机构、螺丝

当一台复杂的机器在运转时，这些部件的运动形成了一个有序的层级结构。

然而，机器和生物之间有一个根本的区别。机器是由这些独立的部件组装而成的，每个部件都可以单独存在。而生物则不同，它的各个部分虽然也会运动，但它们从一开始就是作为一个整体而存在的，构成了一种完全不同的层级结构。这种差异反映了生命的独特性和复杂性，也是为什么我们在研究生物运动时需要采用不同于机械研究的方法。

理解这些概念不仅能帮助我们更好地认识周围的世界，还能启发我们在工程设计、生物学研究等领域的创新。生态力学为我们提供了一个新的视角，让我们能够从更宏观、更整体的角度来理解和描述自然界中的各种变化和运动。

THE SUBSTRATUM

The earth considered as a substratum is not only that with respect to which anything moves, it is also that with respect to which anything is right side up, or tilted, or inverted. That is to say, it extends from horizon to horizon; it is horizontal. Gravity is absolute, not relative, at the ecological level.

The puzzling psychological problems of the uprightness of a picture relative to its frame, of a pattern relative to a page, and of an image relative to a retina are not primary problems but derivative.

地球：我们的绝对参照系

在我们日常生活中，地球不仅仅是一个我们生活其上的星球，它还扮演着一个非常重要的角色 —— 它是我们判断一切事物位置和状态的基准。想象一下，当我们说一个物体在「移动」时，我们其实是在说它相对于地球在改变位置。同样，当我们说一个物体是「正的」、「倾斜的」或「倒置的」时，我们也是以地球为参照。从地平线到地平线，地球为我们提供了一个水平的参考面。在这个层面上，重力不是相对的，而是绝对的。

这个概念可能看起来很简单，但它实际上解决了许多看似复杂的问题。比如，为什么我们能立即判断一幅挂歪了的画？为什么我们能轻易分辨出一个倒置的文字？这些问题的答案都源于我们以地球为基准的感知方式。

Note that displacements and turns and deformations, even wave motions and the flow of a stream, may occur without breaking the continuity of any surface. Rupture occurs when the continuity fails, and this is a highly signi- ficant ecological event. For the cracked ground, as in an earthquake, cannot be walked upon, and a torn roof does not afford shelter. The broken pot no longer holds water, and the broken skin of the animal constitutes an injury. The maximum of disruption can be thought of as disintegration. The surface "falls to pieces," as we say, which means a complete failure of continuity. In that case, the event passes from a change in layout to a change in existence; the surface ceases to exist because the substance has changed its"state."

Finally, let us note another very interesting fact about these events: some are reversible in time and some are not. Displacements and turns, together with locomotions, can go backward as well as forward. Locomotion, as I emphasized earlier, entails both going and coming, and this is why hidden surfaces become unhidden and unhidden surfaces become hidden. Similarly, lighted surfaces become shadowed and shadowed surfaces become lighted. Any rigid motion of a body in physical mechanics has an equivalent motion in the opposite direction. This reversibility holds for certain nonrigid deformations, although not all, but it does not hold for the disruption of a surface. More exactly, the change from integral to broken is not the reverse of the change from broken to integral; the process of going to pieces is not the opposite of the process of repairing. At the extreme case, when a surface disintegrates, it is not reciprocal to the aggregating and connecting of parts so as to yield a whole surface. The difference between the two processes can be observed by making a motion picture sequence of a surface being broken, or a fabric being torn, and then comparing the film run forward with the film run backward (Gibson and Kaushall, 1973).

需要注意的是，位移、旋转和变形，甚至是波动和流水，都可能在不破坏任何表面连续性的情况下发生。然而，当连续性失效时，就会发生破裂，这是一个具有重要生态学意义的事件。因为地震造成的地面裂缝无法行走，破损的屋顶无法遮风挡雨。同样，破碎的容器无法盛水，动物皮肤的破损则意味着受伤。破坏的极致可以被视为完全的解体。我们常说表面「四分五裂」，这意味着连续性的彻底失效。在这种情况下，事件从单纯的布局改变演变为存在状态的改变；由于物质改变了它的「状态」，表面也随之消失。

最后，让我们注意到这些事件的另一个非常有趣的特点：有些是可逆的，有些则不是。位移和旋转，以及运动，都可以向前或向后进行。正如我之前强调的，运动包括离开和返回两个过程，这就解释了为什么隐藏的表面会变得可见，而可见的表面又会被隐藏。同样，被照亮的表面会变得阴暗，阴暗的表面又会重新被照亮。在物理力学中，刚体的任何运动都有一个方向相反的等效运动。这种可逆性适用于某些非刚性变形（尽管不是全部)，但它并不适用于表面的破坏。更准确地说，从完整到破碎的过程与从破碎到完整的过程并不是简单的逆转关系；物体破碎的过程与修复的过程并不是对立的。在极端情况下，当一个表面完全解体时，这个过程与将碎片重新聚合和连接成一个完整表面的过程并不是相互对应的。我们可以通过制作一个表面被破坏或织物被撕裂的视频序列，然后比较正向播放和倒放的效果，来观察这两个过程之间的差异（Gibson and Kaushall，1973)。

### 6.3 Change of Color and Texture due to Change in Composition

Theoretically, a surface can change color without changing shape and change shape without changing color. These are often supposed to be independent "qualities"of an object, and much has been made of the supposed difference between the "secondary" qualities of an object and its "primary"qualities. Actually, color and shape are oversimplified qualities, for texture merges with color and yet is a kind of shape at the level of small-scale layout. We shall here speak of color and texture in combination, since they are specific to the compos- ition of the substance. When the substance is altered by a chemical reaction, the surface is altered. It changes in achromatic color and in chromatic color, and it also usually changes texture, inasmuch as the fine structure goes from, say, crystalline to amorphous. Animals need to perceive the affordances of substances, their chemical values or utilities, in advance of making contact with their surfaces, as I have pointed out before (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 8) and will return to again in this book. A change in affordance is thus signified by the natural chemical changes of greening, ripening, flowering, and fading. They are important ecological events, as are the physiological reactions of animals that bring about alterations of plumage or fur or skin.

物质组成变化导致的颜色和纹理改变

理论上，一个物体的表面可以在保持形状不变的情况下改变颜色，也可以在颜色不变的情况下改变形状。这些通常被认为是物体独立的「属性」，人们经常强调物体所谓的「次要」属性（如颜色、味道）和「主要」属性（如形状、大小）之间的差异。然而实际上，颜色和形状这两个概念过于简单化了。因为纹理与颜色密切相关，但在微观结构层面上又可以被视为一种形状。因此，我们这里将同时讨论颜色和纹理，因为它们都是物质组成的具体表现。

当物质发生化学反应时，其表面也会随之改变。它不仅会在明暗度（即亮度）和色调上发生变化，通常纹理也会改变，因为物质的微观结构可能会从晶体状变为非晶体状。动物需要在接触物质表面之前就能感知物质的可供性（affordances，指物质所能提供的行为机会)，也就是它们的化学价值或用途。我之前曾提到过这一点（Gibson，1966b，第 8 章)，在本书中我还会再次讨论这个话题。

因此，可供性的变化往往通过一系列自然的化学变化过程来表现，比如植物的嫩芽变绿、果实成熟、花朵绽放和凋谢。这些都是极其重要的生态事件，就像动物因生理反应而引起的羽毛、毛发或皮肤的变化一样，都反映了生物与环境之间复杂的相互作用。

CHANGES OF COLOR AND TEXTURE

Plant Surfaces
Greening (increase in chlorophyll)
Fading (decrease in chlorophyll)
Ripening (increase in sugar)
Flowering (presence of nectar)

Animal Surfaces
Coloration of skin (sexual receptivity, as in the baboon)
Change of plumage (maturity)
Change of fur (onset of winter)

Terrestrial Surfaces
Weathering of rock (oxidation)
Blackening of wood(fire)
Reddening of iron (rusting)

颜色和纹理的变化

植物表面
- 变绿（叶绿素增加）
- 褪色（叶绿素减少）
- 成熟（糖分增加）
- 开花（出现花蜜）

动物表面
- 皮肤着色（性接受度，如在狒狒中）
- 羽毛变化（成熟）
- 皮毛变化（冬季来临）

陆地表面
- 岩石风化（氧化）
- 木材变黑（火灾）
- 铁变红（生锈）

The tabulation above presents a few examples of significant surface changes that do not involve gross changes of layout or shape. Commonly, of course, these changes are correlated. Leaves wither and fall as well as turn color when winter approaches. The several varieties of environmental events combine to yield a multiple guarantee of information. A fire with flames, considered as an ecological event instead of an abstract chemical event, consists of complex motions and deformations, fluctuating luminous surfaces, reddening and black- ening of the opaque surfaces, billowing smoke, and finally a disappearance of the solid surfaces. A fire is even specified to the skin, the ears, and the nose as well as to the eyes.

Chemical events at the ecological level involve colored and textured surfaces, whereas chemical events at the molecular and atomic level do not. Molecules and atoms are not colored, and this is an old puzzle for color percep- tion. There is no information in an optic array about radiating atoms, but there is good information about the composition of the substance relative to other substances.

Chemical reactions considered as molecular conversions in test tubes are very often reversible, and this fact can be expressed in chemical equations with double arrows pointing in both directions. But let us note that chemical changes at the ecologicallevel are not reversible in time. Ripening, rusting, and burning do not go backward. There are balanced cycles of ecological change, to be sure, as, for example, the carbon dioxide cycle, but they are progressive in time, I think, not reversible.

前文提到的一些重要表面变化并不涉及整体布局或形状的剧烈改变。当然，在自然界中，这些变化通常是相互关联的。例如，当冬天来临时，树叶不仅会变色，还会枯萎凋落。环境中的多种变化相互叠加，为我们提供了丰富的信息。

让我们以火灾为例来说明这种复杂的生态事件。从生态学的角度来看，一场火灾不仅仅是简单的化学反应，它包含了多种复杂的变化：火焰的跃动和变形，发光表面的闪烁，物体表面的变红和变黑，滚滚升起的浓烟，最后是固体物质的消失。有趣的是，火不仅能被我们的眼睛看到，还能被皮肤感受到温度，被耳朵听到噼啪声，被鼻子闻到烟味，这种多感官的体验为我们提供了全面的环境信息。

在生态层面上，化学事件表现为有颜色和纹理的表面变化。这与分子和原子层面的化学事件有很大不同，后者并不涉及颜色。分子和原子本身是无色的，这一点一直是色彩感知研究中的一个难题。尽管我们无法直接从光线中获取关于原子辐射的信息，但我们可以获得物质相对于其他物质的组成信息。

在实验室的试管中，许多化学反应是可逆的，我们用双向箭头的化学方程式来表示这一点。然而，在生态层面上，化学变化往往是不可逆的。比如，水果的成熟、金属的生锈、物体的燃烧，这些过程都是单向的，不会自发地逆转。虽然自然界中确实存在一些平衡的生态循环，如二氧化碳循环，但这些循环仍然是随时间推进的，而不是简单的来回往复。

### 6.4 Waxing and Waning of a Surface due to Change in the State of Matter

A surface is the interface between a substance and the medium. Substances, however complex, can be classed as solid, viscous, viscoelastic, liquid, and particulate. A gas is not a substance although it is, of course, matter. When a substance goes into the gaseous state it becomes merely a compnent of the medium, and its surface ceases to exist. It has not been dematerialized, but it has been desubstantialized. It no longer reflects light, and it is therefore not specified in any ambient array at any point of observation. It has not merely gone out of sight; it has gone out of existence (Chapter 5). Some of the ways in which surfaces are nullified or destroyed or demolished are listed in the left-hand column of the table below.

Surfaces also, of course, come into existence from the gaseous state, or change from liquid to solid, and examples of these events are given in the right-hand column.

物质状态变化引起的表面变化

表面是物质与其周围环境（通常是空气或水）的交界面。物质可以有多种状态，如固体、粘性物质、粘弹性物质、液体和颗粒状物质。气体虽然也是物质，但它不具有固定的表面。当一种物质变成气态时，它就融入了周围的环境中，失去了明确的表面。这个过程并非物质的消失，而是物质形态的改变。气态物质不再反射光线，因此在任何角度观察时都无法看到明确的表面。这不仅仅是视觉上的消失，而是表面本身的消失。

下面的表格列出了一些导致表面消失或形成的方式。左栏是表面消失的例子，右栏是表面形成的例子。

When ice or snow melts, a surface is so radically altered that it can be consid- ered to be destroyed, and when a puddle of water evaporates, the surface is certainly destroyed. When the reflecting surface of a cloud dissipates, it is anni- hilated although it was semitransparent and barely substantial to begin with, being nothing but a mass of droplets. When a surface disintegrates or an organism dies, the substances are scattered and the surface ceases. Ecological surface destruction is fairly obvious, but ecological surface creation is not, except for the slow growth of animals and plants.

当冰或雪融化时，其表面发生如此剧烈的变化，以至于可以认为这个表面已经被破坏了。同样，当一滩水蒸发时，其表面无疑也消失了。云朵的反射表面看似虚无缥缈，本质上不过是一团水滴构成的半透明体，当它消散时，这个表面也就不复存在了。当一个物体的表面分解或者一个生物体死亡时，构成它们的物质会四散分离，表面随之消失。

在自然界中，表面的破坏过程通常是显而易见的。相比之下，表面的形成过程则不那么明显，除了我们能观察到动植物的缓慢生长之外。这种生态表面的创造过程往往不如破坏过程那样引人注目。

SURFACE THEORY AND ATOMIC THEORY

The fact that surfaces go out of and come into existence is little recognized in physics, as noted in Chapter 1. The atomic theory is emphasized instead. Beginning with Parmenides and Democritus, the theory asserts that nothing is ever created or destroyed; only the atoms, themselves unchanging, are rearranged. Aristotle disagreed. He insisted that there was an actual genesis of things in the world and a passing away of them. At the ecological level Aristotle was quite right. And it is at this level, the level of surfaces, that we perceive the world. At the level of atoms we do not (Randall, 1960).

表面理论和原子理论

正如第一章所提到的，物理学界很少关注表面消失和出现这一现象。相反，物理学家们更倾向于强调原子理论。这一理论可以追溯到古希腊哲学家巴门尼德和德谟克利特，他们认为世间万物既不会凭空产生，也不会彻底消失，只是由不变的原子以不同方式重新组合而已。然而，亚里士多德对此持不同看法。他坚持认为，世界上的事物确实会经历实际的产生和消亡过程。从生态学的角度来看，亚里士多德的观点是正确的。事实上，我们正是在这个层面 —— 即表面的层面 —— 感知和理解周围的世界。而在原子层面，我们则无法直接观察到这些现象 (Randall, 1960)。

In the above table I have tried to show the best possible case for the opposi- tion of these processes, but it seems clear that they are not reversible in time. Evaporation and condensation are opposite at a certain level, but a water surface is not created as the reverse of the process by which it is destroyed. In none of these event pairs, I think, is the one simply a going backward of the other, such that if a film of one event were reversed, it would represent the other, as I noted above (Gibson and Kaushall, 1973).

虽然我们可以尝试将这些过程描述为相互对立的关系，但很显然，它们在时间上并非完全可逆。比如说，蒸发和凝结在某种程度上可以看作是相反的过程，但是水面的形成并不能简单地视为水面消失过程的逆转。我认为，在这些成对出现的现象中，没有哪一个可以被简单地视为另一个的完全逆过程。换句话说，如果我们将记录其中一个过程的影片倒着播放，它并不能准确地表现出另一个过程，这一点我在先前的研究中也有提及 (Gibson and Kaushall, 1973)。

### 6.5 Summary: What Shall we Take as an Event?

The foregoing classification is a kind of preliminary survey only. Ecological events are various and difficult to formalize. But when we attempt to reduce them to elementary physical events, they become impossibly complex, and physical complexity then blinds us to ecological simplicity. For there are regu- larities to be found at the higher level, regularities that cannot now be encom- passed by the simple equations of mechanics and physics. The movements of animals, for example, are lawful in ways that cannot yet be derived from the laws of orthodox mechanics, and perhaps never can be. A too strict adherence to mechanics has hampered the study of terrestrial events.

概要：我们应该如何定义事件？

前面的分类只是一种初步的探索。生态事件（ecological events）种类繁多，难以用固定的形式来描述。当我们试图将它们简化为基本的物理事件时，却发现它们变得极其复杂。这种物理层面的复杂性反而使我们忽视了生态层面的简单性。因为在更高层次上，我们可以发现一些规律，而这些规律目前还无法用力学和物理学的简单方程来完全描述。例如，动物的运动是有规律的，但这些规律目前还无法从经典力学定律中推导出来，也许永远无法推导出来。过于严格地坚持力学原理反而阻碍了我们对地球上各种现象的研究。

Events as Primary Realities

In the first place, the flow of ecological events is distinct from the abstract passage of time assumed in physics. The stream of events is heterogeneous and differentiated into parts, whereas the passage of time is supposed to be homo- geneous and linear. Isaac Newton asserted that "absolute, true, and mathemat- ical time, of itself and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external."But this is a convenient myth. It assumes that events occur "in"time and that time is empty unless"filled." This habitual way of thinking puts the cart before the horse. We should begin thinking of events as the primary realities and of time as an abstraction from them-a concept derived mainly from regular repeating events, such as the ticking of clocks. Events are perceived, but time is not (Gibson, 1975).

It is the same with space as with time. Objects do not fill space, for there was no such thing as empty space to begin with. The persisting surfaces of the environment are what provide the framework of reality. The world was never a void. As for the medium, the region in which motion and locomotion can occur, where light can reverberate and surfaces can be illuminated, this might be called room but it is not space. Surfaces and their layout are perceived, but space is not, as I have long been arguing (Gibson, 1950).

It might be said, without going as far as I have done above, that time consists of the events filling it and that space consists of the objects filling it. But I will argue that this formula still perpetuates the fallacy. The metaphor of filling is wrong. Time and space are not empty receptacles to be filled; instead, they are simply the ghosts of events and surfaces.

Time is not another dimension of space, a fourth dimension, as modern physics assumes for reasons of mathematical convenience. The reality under- lying the dimension of time is the sequential order of events, and the reality underlying the dimensions of space is the adjacent order of objects or surface parts. Sequential order is not comparable to adjacent order; it is not even analogous to adjacent order. For the order of events cannot be permuted, whereas the order of parts can. You can reshuffle the parts but not the events, as you can rearrange the furniture in a room but not the happenings that occur in it.

事件是主要的现实

首先，生态事件的流动与物理学中假设的抽象时间流逝是不同的。事件流是多样化的，可以分为不同的部分，而时间的流逝则被认为是均匀和线性的。牛顿曾断言，「绝对的、真实的和数学的时间，本身和从其本质上，均匀流动，与任何外部事物无关。」但这只是一个便于理解的假设。它假设事件发生「在」时间中，而时间本身是空的，除非被「填满」。这种习惯性的思维方式本末倒置了。我们应该开始将事件视为主要的现实，而时间则是从事件中抽象出来的概念 —— 主要源于规律重复的事件，如时钟的滴答声。我们可以感知事件，但无法直接感知时间（Gibson，1975)。

空间的概念与时间类似。物体并不是填充空间，因为一开始就不存在所谓的空空间。环境中持续存在的表面提供了现实的框架。世界从来就不是一片虚无。至于我们活动的环境，即运动可以发生的区域，光可以反射和表面可以被照亮的地方，这可以称为空间，但它不是抽象的空间概念。我们可以感知表面及其布局，但无法直接感知空间，这是我长期以来一直在论证的观点（Gibson，1950)。

有人可能会说，不必像我上面那样极端，可以认为时间由填充它的事件组成，空间由填充它的物体组成。但我认为，这种说法仍然延续了一个误解。「填充」这个比喻是不恰当的。时间和空间不是需要被填满的空容器；相反，它们只是事件和表面的抽象映射。

时间不是空间的另一个维度，不是所谓的第四维度，尽管现代物理学出于数学便利性的考虑做出了这样的假设。时间维度背后的现实是事件的先后顺序，而空间维度背后的现实是物体或表面部分的相邻关系。这两种顺序是不能相互比较的；它们甚至不是类似的。因为事件的顺序是不能随意调换的，而物体部分的顺序可以。你可以重新排列物体的部分，但不能重新安排已经发生的事件，就像你可以重新布置房间里的家具，但不能改变在房间里已经发生的事情。

Recurrence and Nonrecurrence

There is always some degree of recurrence and some degree of nonrecurrence in the flow of ecological events. That is, there are cases of pure repetition, such as the stepping motions of the escapement of a clock and the rotations of its hands, and cases of nonrepetition or novelty, such as cloud formations and the shifting sandbars of a river. Each new sunrise is like the previous one and yet unlike it, and so is each new day. An organism, similarly, is never quite the same as it was before, although it has rhythms. This rule for events is consistent with the general formula of nonchange underlying change.

重复性和非重复性

在生态事件（ecological events）的发展过程中，总是存在某种程度的重复和非重复。有些事件是纯粹重复的，比如钟表内部齿轮的周期性运动和指针的旋转；而有些事件则是不重复或全新的，如云朵的形成和河流沙洲的变迁。每一次日出都与前一次相似，却又各不相同，每一天也是如此。同样地，生物虽然有其生理节奏，但也在不断变化，从未与之前的自己完全相同。这种既有重复又有变化的特性，符合「变化中存在不变」的普遍规律。

Reversible and Nonreversible events

Some ecological events are reversible sequences, whereas others are nonreversible. Change of position can go backward, but change of state cannot. More exactly, the sequential order of the short events that make up a long event, beginning to end, cannot be turned around, end to beginning, without violating certain laws of ecological physics. Breaking is not reciprocal to mending, and when it is made to seem so the event is magical. This fact is in contrast to events governed by the formal laws of physics where, except for thermodynamics, events could as well go backward as forward. The variable of time in these equations "has no arrow." This suggests then that the so-called irreversibility of time is actually the irrevers- ibility of some, but not all, ecological events. It is simply not true that the only way of specifying the direction of time is by increase of entropy.

可逆和不可逆事件

生态事件中，有些是可逆的，而有些则是不可逆的。比如，位置的改变可以往复，但状态的改变往往是单向的。更具体地说，构成一个长期事件的一系列短期事件，它们的发生顺序是不能随意颠倒的，否则就会违反某些自然规律。例如，一个花瓶打碎了，这个过程是不可逆的 —— 你不能简单地将碎片拼回去就让花瓶恢复原状。如果在魔术表演中看到这样的「逆转」，那只是一种幻觉。

这一特性与传统物理学中的事件有所不同。在物理方程中（除了热力学），事件理论上可以向前或向后发展，时间变量没有固定的方向。这意味着，所谓的「时间不可逆性」实际上是指某些（但不是全部）生态事件的不可逆性。因此，认为时间方向只能通过熵增来确定是不正确的。生态事件为我们提供了另一种理解时间方向的视角。

The Nesting of Events

The flow of ecological events consists of natural units that are nested within one another-episodes within episodes, subordinate ones and superordinate ones. What we take to be a unitary episode is therefore a matter of choice and depends on the beginning and the end that are appropriate, not on the units of measurement. The number of espisodes in a sequence cannot be counted unless the unit episode has been decided upon. Episodes, like surfaces, are structured at various levels. Years and days are natural units of sequential structure; hours, minutes, and seconds are arbitrary and artificial units. Some of the best exam- ples of a nested hierarchy of sequential events are found in the behavior of animals, and most obviously in the human production of events such as speech, music, and the theater. If we can understand these nested sequences, it may be possible to understand how it could be that in some cases the outcome of an event sequence is implicit at the outset-how the end is present at the beginning-so that it is possible to foresee the end when an observer sees the beginning.

事件的嵌套结构

生态事件（ecological events）的发展过程由一系列相互嵌套的自然单位组成 —— 就像一个大事件中包含许多小事件，既有下级事件，也有上级事件。因此，我们如何定义一个「统一事件」，实际上取决于我们如何选择其适当的开始和结束点，而不是依赖于固定的测量单位。如果不先确定什么是一个基本事件单位，我们就无法计算一个序列中包含多少个事件。事件，就像物体的表面一样，具有多层次的结构。年和日是自然形成的时间单位，而小时、分钟和秒则是人为规定的单位。

事件嵌套结构的最佳例子可以在动物行为中找到，特别是在人类的各种活动中，如言语、音乐和戏剧表演。如果我们能够理解这些嵌套的事件序列，就可能解释为什么在某些情况下，一个事件序列的结果在一开始就已经隐含其中 —— 也就是说，结束在开始时就已经存在。这就是为什么有时候，当我们看到一个事件的开始，就能预见它的结束。

The Affordances of Events

Finally, it should be emphasized that some natural events demand or invite appropriate behaviors. Some have what I called affordances for animals, just as do places, objects, and other animals, and others involve a change in the affordance of the place, object, or other animal. A fire affords warmth on a cold night; it also affords being burnt. An approaching object affords either contact without colli- sion or contact with collision; a tossed apple is one thing, but a missile is another. For one of our early ancestors, an approaching rabbit afforded eating whereas an approaching tiger afforded being eaten. These events are not stimuli, and it is preposterous for psychologists to call them that. The question is: what informa- tion is available in the light by means of which these events can be perceived?

事件的可供性

最后，我们需要强调的是，某些自然事件会要求或引导适当的行为。有些事件对动物来说具有我所称的可供性（affordances)，就像地点、物体和其他动物一样，而其他事件则涉及地点、物体或其他动物可供性的变化。例如，在寒冷的夜晚，火焰提供了取暖的可供性；但它同时也提供了被烧伤的可供性。一个接近中的物体可能提供无碰撞的接触，也可能提供碰撞式的接触；一个被抛出的苹果是一回事，而一枚飞来的导弹则是另一回事。对我们的远古祖先而言，一只接近的兔子提供了「可以食用」的可供性，而一只接近的老虎则提供了「可能被吃」的可供性。这些事件并非简单的刺激，心理学家将它们称为刺激是不恰当的。我们真正需要探讨的问题是：光线中包含了什么信息，使我们能够感知这些事件？

### 6.6 The Optical Information for Perceiving Events

We can now ask what happens in the ambient optic array when there is an event in the environment. What specifies the event? In general terms, the answer must be that there is a disturbance in the invariant structure of the array. Presumably there are different kinds of disturbances for different kinds of events.

Once again, let us remind ourselves that events in the world should not be confused with the information in light corresponding to them. Just as there are no material objects in an array but only the invariants to specify objects, so there are no material events in an array but only the information to specify events. No object in the world is literally replicated in ambient light by a copy or simulacrum. And as for what happens in the world, it could not possibly be replicated or copied in the light. We ought to realize this, but nevertheless there has been a strong temptation to assume that the motions of bodies in the world are copied by motions of elements in the light, or at least that motions in two dimensions are copied, although not motions in depth. But I shall try to show that this assumption is quite mistaken since the two kinds of "motion,"physical and optical, have nothing in common and probably should not even have the same term applied to them. The beginning and the end of the disturbance in the light correspond to the beginning and the end of the event in the world, but that is about as far as the correspondence goes.

感知事件的光学信息

我们现在可以探讨，当环境中发生事件时，周围的光学信息场会发生什么变化。什么样的变化能够表征这个事件呢？总的来说，答案是光学信息场的不变结构中会出现某种扰动。可以推测，不同类型的事件会导致不同类型的扰动。

在此，我们需要再次强调，环境中发生的事件不应与光学信息中对应的信息相混淆。就像光学信息场中不存在实际的物体，而只有表征物体的不变特征一样，光学信息场中也不存在实际的事件，而只有表征事件的信息。环境中的任何物体都不会在周围的光学信息中被完全复制或模拟。同样，环境中发生的事情也不可能在光学信息中被完全复制或模拟。

尽管我们应该意识到这一点，但人们仍然很容易误以为环境中物体的运动会被光学信息中元素的「运动」所复制。有些人甚至认为，至少二维平面上的运动可以被复制，即使深度方向的运动无法被复制。但我将试图说明，这种假设是完全错误的。因为这两种「运动」—— 物理运动和光学运动 —— 实际上毫无共同之处，甚至可能不应该使用同一个术语来描述它们。

光学信息中扰动的开始和结束确实对应着环境中事件的开始和结束，但这大概就是它们之间对应关系的全部了。换句话说，光学信息的变化方式与实际物理事件的发生方式是完全不同的，我们不能简单地认为一个是另一个的「复制」。

### 6.7 Mechanical Events

With respect to mechanical events, consider first the case of a rigid translation where the distance of the object from the point of observation remains constant. As the object is displaced relative to the environment, you might think that the corresponding visual solid angle would simply be displaced relative to the sphere of ambient light. The visual form would not change; the "figure"would simply move over the "ground."But this is wrong, however plausible it sounds. The visual solid angle for the object is only one of an array of solid angles. The array is filled; it is mathematically dense. A given patch cannot move in the way that a body can move in space, for it has no space to move in. What happens is nothing simpler than a disturbance of structure. At one border of the visual solid angle, progressive deletion occurs, while at the opposite border progressive accretion occurs. The former corresponds to the leading edge of the object and the latter to the trailing edge. Or, if the background of the translating object is not textured, as happens with an object moving in a large, empty gap such as the sky, then the interspaces between the edges of the object and the nearest edges constitute patches that are decremented and incremented. This decre-menting and incrementing is similar to the deletion and accretion of textural units. What I am saying is that even a motion in the sky is a change in the sky- form, that even a displacement within the frame of a window is a change of structure and not simply a motion.

物理事件

在讨论物理事件时，让我们首先考虑一种特殊情况：物体的刚性平移，即物体与观察者的距离保持不变的移动。当物体相对于环境移动时，你可能会认为我们看到的物体的视觉形象只是简单地在视野中移动，就像一幅画中的图形在背景上滑动一样。然而，尽管这种想法听起来很合理，但实际上是错误的。

为什么这种直观的理解是错误的呢？这是因为我们看到的物体只是整个视觉场景中的一部分。整个视觉场景是完整且连续的，就像数学中的稠密集合一样，没有空隙。因此，物体的视觉形象并不能像实体在物理空间中那样「移动」，因为它在视觉场景中没有可以移动的空间。

那么，当物体移动时，我们的视觉体验实际上是怎样的呢？发生的是一种更复杂的结构变化。在物体移动方向的前方（即物体的前缘），我们会看到原本被物体遮挡的背景逐渐显露出来；而在物体移动方向的后方（即物体的尾缘），我们会看到背景逐渐被物体遮挡。这种变化类似于在视觉场景中删除和添加纹理单元。

即使是看似简单的情况，比如物体在晴朗的天空中移动，也不仅仅是「运动」，而是整个天空视觉形态的变化。同样，即使是物体在窗框内的移动，也是整个视觉结构的变化，而不仅仅是单纯的位置变化。

The above case of rigid translation is special; the object neither approaches nor recedes from the point of observation, and no change occurs within the contour corresponding to the object. Normally there is magnification or mini- fication of the contour. Magnification is accompanied by progressive deletion of the optical structure outside the contour and minification by its opposite, progressive accretion. This says that an object hides more and more of the environment as it comes closer to the point of observation, and less and less as it goes farther away. Magnification of a form in the array means the approach of something, and minification means the recession of something. When a visual solid angle of the ambient array approaches a hemisphere, the ultimate limit that a solid angle can reach, an angle 180° in width, an event of great significance is specified, that is, an object in contact with the point of observation. This is a general law of natural perspective. The actual pickup of this information by an animal having eyes is a psychological problem of great interest. The behavior of animals when an impending contact or collision is specified by this "looming" of the form has been studied by W. Schiff (1965). What happens when the observer approaches an object or an aperture is different and will be described in Chapter 12.

上述讨论的是一种特殊情况，即物体与观察者的距离保持不变的移动。在现实世界中，物体通常会靠近或远离观察者，这时我们会看到物体视觉形象的放大或缩小。当物体靠近时，它的视觉形象变大，同时遮挡了更多的背景；当物体远离时，它的视觉形象变小，遮挡的背景也减少了。

这种视觉形象的放大和缩小为我们提供了重要的信息。形象的放大意味着物体正在接近，而缩小则意味着物体正在远离。当一个物体的视觉形象扩大到占据我们整个视野的一半时（即 180 度宽的视角），这表明物体已经接触到了观察者 —— 这是一个极其重要的事件。

这些视觉变化的规律被称为自然透视法则。动物如何利用这些视觉信息来感知和反应，是一个非常有趣的心理学问题。例如，W. Schiff 在 1965 年研究了当动物看到物体的视觉形象急剧放大（暗示即将发生碰撞）时的行为反应。

值得注意的是，当观察者主动接近物体或开口时，情况会有所不同。这个有趣的话题我们将在第 12 章详细讨论。

These optical disturbances are clearly not copies of the corresponding motions of objects, as everyone would agree. But what about the case of the pure rotation of an object on its axis, a Newtonian spin? There need be little or no progressive incrementing and decrementing of the background in this case. If the object is a sphere, disk, or wheel that rotates on an axis that is on the line of sight to the point of observation, you might say that the rotation of the circular form in the array is a copy of the rotation of the circular object in the world, point for point. But this would be a misconception, even for this special case. What happens optically is a sort of shearing or slippage of the texture at the contour as the object rotates in front of its background, although nothing is taken from or added to the array. This is a disturbance in the continuity of the array. Another way of putting it is to say that the align- ments of textural units, the radii of the circle, for instance, are shifted at the contour. Apart from this special case, all other rotations of objects, and all noncircular objects, will cause progressive loss and gain of optical texture by foreshortening to the limit at one border and inverse foreshortening from the limit at the other border; that is to say, faces of the object will go out of and come into sight. In short, objects in general cannot rotate without causing a change of occlusion.

当我们观察运动的物体时，我们看到的视觉变化并不总是物体实际运动的直接复制。这一点在大多数情况下是显而易见的。但是，让我们考虑一个特殊的情况：物体绕自身轴心旋转，也就是物理学中所说的 "自旋"。在这种情况下，我们看到的景象似乎没有太大变化，特别是当背景保持不变时。

想象一个球体或圆盘，它的旋转轴正对着你的视线。你可能会认为，你所看到的圆形图像的旋转完全复制了实际物体的旋转，就像一一对应的关系。但事实上，即使在这种看似简单的情况下，我们的视觉体验也与实际发生的情况有所不同。

从光学角度来看，当物体在背景前旋转时，我们观察到的是物体轮廓处纹理的一种 "剪切" 或 "滑移" 现象。虽然整体图像中没有增加或减少任何元素，但是纹理的连续性在轮廓处被打断了。举个例子，如果你仔细观察一个旋转的圆盘，你会发现圆盘边缘处的纹理线条（比如半径）似乎在发生位移。

对于更复杂的情况，比如非圆形物体的旋转，或者从其他角度观察的旋转，视觉效果会更加复杂。我们会看到物体的某些部分逐渐消失在视野中，而其他部分则逐渐出现。这种现象在光学上表现为纹理的逐渐损失和增加。简而言之，当物体旋转时，总会导致我们视野中遮挡关系的变化。

What happens in the array when a surface in the world is deformed? It is plausible in that case to suppose that the deformation of the optical texture is a copy of the deformation of the substantial texture, since the optical units are projections of the substantial units, by natural perspective, and are in one-to-one correspondence with them. It would seem that the uneven flow of the surface of water in a river-the bubbles and flecks of the surface-has a corresponding flow of the optical texture in the array. But this does not hold for the ripples or waves over the surface, because the ripples do not move in the same way the textured surface does. The fluctuation of light and shade does not correspond to the surface. And, of course, if the crests of the waves are high they will begin to hide the troughs, and the occluding edges will spoil the projective correspondence.



那么，当我们观察一个变形的表面时，情况又如何呢？比如说，一条流动的河流。乍一看，我们可能会认为水面上气泡和涟漪的运动直接对应于我们看到的视觉变化。毕竟，表面的每个点似乎都有一个对应的光学投影点。然而，实际情况要复杂得多。

以水面的波纹为例。波纹的运动方式与水面实际的运动并不完全一致。我们看到的光影变化并不直接对应于水面的起伏。更不用说，如果波浪较高，波峰会遮挡波谷，进一步打破了这种表面与视觉之间的简单对应关系。

这些例子说明，我们的视觉体验是一个复杂的过程，不能简单地视为现实世界的直接复制。理解这一点对于我们更好地解释我们所看到的世界，以及在科技领域（如计算机图形学和机器视觉）中模拟真实世界的视觉效果都具有重要意义。


What happens in the array when a surface is ruptured or broken? The math-ematical continuity of the surface texture fails, and so does the mathematical continuity of the optical texture. As the crack in the surface becomes a gap, occluding edges appear where there were none previously. As the gap widens, a new surface is revealed. A different optical texture fills the gap and is added to the array. This emergence of new structure in the gap is perhaps the crucial information. A precise decription is needed, but this may prove to be difficult. Mathematicians do not seem to have been successful with the problem of discontinuity.

With respect to mechanical events of all sorts, then, it is a serious mistake to assume that "an optical motion is a projection in two dimensions of a physical motion in three dimensions"(Gibson, 1957，p. 289)，as I myself once wrote in a paper on what I called "optical motions and transformations." The notion of point-to-point correspondence in projective geometry, simple and powerful as it is, does not apply to the optics of events any more than it applies to the optics of opaque surfaces. For it leaves occlusion out of account. The fallacy lies deep in our conception of empty space, especially the so-called third dimension of space. Whatever the perception of space may be, if there is any such thing, it is not simply the perception of the dimension of depth.

当我们观察一个表面破裂或断裂的过程时，我们的视觉体验会发生一系列有趣的变化。首先，我们需要理解，任何表面都有其独特的纹理模式，这种模式在数学上可以被描述为连续的。当表面完好无损时，我们看到的视觉纹理（也就是光线反射给我们的图像）也是连续的。

然而，当表面开始破裂时，这种连续性被打破了。想象一下，当你看着一块木板慢慢裂开的过程：

1. 最初，你会看到一条细线出现在表面上，这就是裂缝的开始。

2. 随着裂缝变宽，你会注意到裂缝的边缘开始遮挡住裂缝内部，这些边缘我们称之为 "遮挡边缘"。

3. 当裂缝继续扩大，你会发现裂缝内部露出了新的表面，这个新表面有着与原表面不同的纹理。

这个过程中最关键的信息可能就是新结构（新表面）的出现。虽然我们日常生活中经常看到这种现象，但要精确地描述这个过程却并不容易。有趣的是，即使是数学家们也常常难以用数学语言准确描述这种不连续性。

这个例子说明，我们看到的视觉变化并不仅仅是物理世界的简单投影。我曾经在一篇关于 "光学运动和变换" 的论文中写道："光学运动是三维物理运动在二维上的投影"（Gibson，1957，p. 289）。但现在我认识到，这种说法是有问题的。

在几何学中，我们常用点对点的对应关系来描述投影。这种方法虽然简单有效，但它无法完全描述我们实际看到的世界。因为在现实世界中，物体会相互遮挡，而这种遮挡关系在简单的投影模型中是无法体现的。

这个问题揭示了我们对空间概念理解的局限性，特别是对所谓 "第三维度"（即深度）的理解。虽然我们常说自己生活在三维空间中，但我们对空间的感知远比简单地感知 "深度" 要复杂得多。

总的来说，这个讨论提醒我们，在研究视觉感知时，我们需要超越简单的几何模型，考虑更多复杂的因素，如表面的破裂、新表面的出现、以及物体间的遮挡关系等。只有这样，我们才能更好地理解和描述我们所看到的丰富多彩的视觉世界。




Chemical Events

What happens in the optic array when the composition of a surface in the multicolored layout of surfaces is altered? The green plant flowers, and the green fruit ripens; the rock weathers, and the wood blackens. The change in composition is almost always specified by a change in reflectance, both unse- lective and selective, both achromatic and chromatic. A substance is necessarily a colorant in the general sense of the term, if not a pigment.

The reflectances of surfaces tend to persist insofar as the substances are chemically inert, as I pointed out, and this persistence is a source of invariant structure in the ambient optical array. But they do not persist when the substances are not inert, and the surfaces of organisms especially are chemically active. Plants and animals change their color and texture with the seasons of the year.

But, unhappily, we do not know what happens in the optic array when one of the surfaces of the environment changes color. There is a "disturbance,"no doubt, of the underlying invariant structure, but that is vague. The difficulty is that we do not know what invariant in an array specifies a persistent surface color in the world, let alone a changing surface color. We do not know what specifies composition. We do not know how black and white are specified separately from shaded and lighted. I suggested that the moving source of illumination was basic to the problem, but I have not developed the theory.

It is easier to say what happens in the optic array when one of the surfaces of the environment changes texture. The pigment texture of a flat, conglomerate surface is projected in the array, and the quality, density, and regularity of the pigment texture are specified in the optical texture despite all kinds of perspective transformations. These "forms"of texture are also invariant under changing direction of illumination and changing amount of illumination. Perhaps the composition of the substance is given in this way and, since that is what counts for animals, the pure abstract reflectance of the surface is of lesser importance than we are apt to suppose.

Destruction and Creation of Surfaces

Finally, we ask what information is in an optic array for the coming into and going out of existence of surfaces caused by changes in the state of matter. The reader will recall that whenever ambient light is structured in one part and unstructured in an adjacent part a surface is specified in the former and a void in the latter. Thus, the textured region below the horizon specifies the solid earth, and the homogeneous region above it specifies the empty sky. Similarly, the heterogeneous areas in the sky specify surfaces, even if only clouds, and the homogeneous areas between clouds specify the absence of a surface. The leafy canopy in a forest provides an overhead texture; the holes in the canopy are textureless, and it is into these holes that the birds fly. So long as any visual solid angle in the array remains unstructured it specifies a hole; it can be magnified to the hemispherical limit, and the bird will not collide with any surface but will fly through the hole.

In the upper hemisphere of the ambient array, cloud surfaces dissipate, and we say they vanish. The optical texture is supplanted by the absence of texture. Cloud surfaces also form in the sky, and we say that they have material- ized. The absence of texture is supplanted by texture. In the lower hemisphere of the array, the optical transitions are more complex, for there is always a background texture. With evaporation of a liquid surface, or the sublimation of a solid surface, or the dissolving of it, the optical texture is supplanted by that of whatever lay behind it. As one structure is nullified, another takes its place. Sometimes the substance of the object becomes transparent during the transition, which means that one surface is specified behind another. This information is displayed in what the motion picture technician calls a dissolve, whereby one layout goes out of sight as another comes into sight in precisely the same place. There is a "fade-out" and a "fade-in."both of which occur at the same time.

THE THEORY OF SPIRITS

These our actors
Are melted into air, into thin air:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind.

Shakespeare, The Tempest

The optical transitions that specify dissipation, evaporation, sublima- tion, dissolution, disintegration, and decay seem to be complex variants of the substitution of one texture for another. No systematic study of them has ever been made. But children notice them, are fascinated, and look closely at the regions of the optic array where such substitutions occur. Presumably they learn to distinguish among these substitutions and to perceive what they mean.

The difference between the loss of optical texture from an array by progressive substitution and the loss of optical texture from an array by progressive deletion on one side of a contour has been illustrated in preliminary fashion by a motion picture film (Gibson, 1968a). The loss by substitution should specify a surface that goes out of existence. The loss by deletion should specify a surface that goes out of sight at an occluding edge, as described in the last section. These radically different happenings are, in fact, seen, or so people say when they watch the film.

The Kinds of Disturbance of Optical Structuce

I said that the most general term for what happens in the optic array when something happens in the world is a disturbance of its structure. There is no existing terminology for describing optical changes (or physical changes, for that matter), so one has to grope for the best terms. I have spoken of optical trans- formations and of permutations. I talked about fluctuations in connection with changing light and shade. I have referred to optical transitions. I argued that one should not speak of motions in the array. The best general term seems to be disturbances. Consider the kinds that have been described:

1. Progressive deletion and accretion of units on one side of a contour (displacement of an object against a background)

2. Progressive decrementing and incrementing of gaps (displacement of an object against the sky)

3. Shearing or slippage of optical texture at a contour (rotation of a disk)

4. Perspective transformation by foreshortening and its opposite (turning of the face of an object)

5. Magnification to the limit and minification (approach and recession of an object)

6. Deformation (fluid, viscous, and elastic events)

7. Emergence of new structure (rupturing)

8. Nullification of texture (dissipation in the sky)

9. Substitution of new texture for old (dissipation on earth)

10. Change of "color structure"(chemical events)

What a strange list of phenomena! They are not easy to describe or to under- stand. Yet these optical happenings or something like them occur all the time in the array of light to the eye. Even if no one sees them as such, they carry the information about events in the environment. In the changing array from a motion picture screen, an array that is saturated with meaning, these must be the "motions"of the motion picture that convey the meaning. They are surely lawful, and they deserve to be studied in their own right, from a fresh point of view, and without the accumulated prejudices that the theory of light stimuli has fostered.

Can these disturbances of structure be treated mathematically? They surely cannot all be treated with the same mathematical method, for some of them do not conform to the assumptions of the theory of sets. Some of the above changes do not preserve a one-to-one mapping of units over time, inasmuch as the array gains or loses units in time. Accretion or deletion of texture during occlusion is one such case. Foreshortening or compression of texture preserves one-to-one mapping only until it reaches its limit, after which texture is lost. The emer- gence of new texture with rupturing of a surface, the nullification of texture with dissipation of a surface, and the substitution of new texture for old are still other cases of the failure of one-to-one mapping, or projective correspondence. In all of these cases it is not the fact that each unit of the ambient array at one time goes into a corresponding unit of the array at a later time. The case of an optic array that undergoes "fashing" or scintillation of its units is another example, and so is what I called fluctuation in connection with changing light and shade.

On the other hand, some of these optical disturbances do seem to preserve one-to-one correspondence of units over time, namely, the perspective trans- formations, the deformations or topological transformations, and even the shearing or slippage of optical texture at a contour. In the case of a partial permutation of a spot-texture, or a radical permutation such as the random displacements called Brownian movement, there is still a persistence of units without gain or loss. The invariants under transformation, the ratios and proportions and relations among units, are richest for the disturbances at the beginning of the above list and poorest for the permutations at the end, but invariants are discoverable throughout. A disturbance of connectedness or adja- cent order is more serious than a mere disturbance of form. A complete scram- bling of the adjacent order of units is still more serious. But a mathematical theory of invariants may be possible for all these disturbances of structure with persistence. What is lacking is a theory of the invariants that are preserved under disturbances with nonpersistence of units.

THE OPTICAL MAGNIFICATION OF NESTED FORMS

If a surface is composed of units nested within larger units, its optic array is composed of solid angles nested within larger solid angles. As a point of observation approaches a surface, all angles are magnified toward the limit of a whole angle (180°), even those whose units were too small to see at a distance. The closer a surface, the more its subordinate units become visible. Does this progress have an end?

These disturbances in the optic array are not similar to the events in the environment that they specify. The superficial likenesses are misleading. Even if the optical disturbances could be reduced to the motions of spots, they would not be like the motions of bodies or particles in space. Optical spots have no mass and no inertia, they cannot collide, and in fact, because they are usually not spots at all but forms nested within one another, they cannot even move. This is why I suggested that a so-called optical motion had so little in common with a physical motion that it should not even be called a motion.

In what way, if any, does an optical disturbance correspond to the event in the environment that it specifies? It corresponds in sequential order. The begin- ning and the end of the disturbance in the array are concurrent with the begin- ning and the end of the event in the environment, and there is no latency or delay. If events are simultaneous, the disturbances are simultaneous. If an event consists of subordinate events, then the disturbance will consist of subordinate disturbances, as when a ball rolls downstairs in a sequence of bounces. If an event is gradual, the disturbance is gradual (a balloon being blow up), and if an event is abrupt, the disturbance is abrupt (the balloon bursting). If an event is unitary (a ball rolling behind a screen and then out again), the disturbance is unitary-deletion and then accretion at the occluding edges. Or so, at least, I suggested.

If a series of repeated events occurs in the environment, a series of repeated disturbances occurs in the ambient optic array. When the events are mechanical, these optical disturbances are usually accompanied by sounds, as in the colliding of objects and the rupturing or cracking of surfaces. The chains of optical and acoustical disturbances run in parallel. And the sequential order of this inform- ation flow cannot be tampered with. Unlike the adjacent order of a series of objects, the sequential order of a series of events cannot be rearranged. Some of the individual events that compose the grand sequence of a day can go backward, displacements for example, but the sequential order of their occurrence is immutable. This is why "time"is said to have an "arrow,"I believe, and this is why "time travel" is a myth.

The Causation of Events

A special kind of mechanical event involving two detached objects and two successive displacements is a collision, in which the first displacement causes the second. It is a superordinate event with two subordinate events. The"bumping" of one elastic object by another is perhaps the most obvious example of a causal sequence that we have.

For an inanimate object, collision may cause breaking, bending, chipping, deformation, and so on, as well as displacement. For the animate object, it may cause injury and all sorts of complex reactions. Philosophers and psychologists since Hume have been debating the question of whether or not such causation could be perceived. Hume asserted that although the motions of the two objects could be sensed, one after the other, it was quite impossible to see the one motion causing the other. Only succession can be perceived, not causation, he believed.

A. Michotte (1963)has attempted to refute Hume. In Chapter 10 we shall consider his evidence. Can one truly perceive a dynamic event as such? Is there information to specify it? Recent experiments at Uppsala suggest there is (Runeson, 1977).

### Summary

A preliminary classification of ecological events was attempted. Only if we have decided what to take as an event can we describe the change in the optic array that results from it. And only after that can we begin to do experiments on the perception of an event. The assumption that a motion in the world brings about a motion in the optic array is quite wrong, although it is often taken for granted.

Three varieties of events were distinguished: changes of surface layout, changes of surface color or texture, and changes in the existence of a surface. Examples of the first variety are translations and rotations of an object, colli- sions, deformations, and disruptions. Examples of the second are the often nameless but significant alterations of the surfaces of plants and animals. Examples of the third are the transitions of evaporation, dissipation, melting, dissolving, and decay. Although some of these events are reversible, many are not.

Ecological events, it was concluded, are nested within longer events, are sometimes recurrent and sometimes novel, are meaningful, and do not flow evenly in the manner of Newton's "absolute mathematical time."

The optical information for distinguishing the various events can only be various disturbances of the local structure of the optic array. A very tentative description was given of certain types of optical disturbance: deletion-accretion, shearing, transformation, magnification-minification, deformation, nullification, and substitution. These disturbances have only begun to be studied, and the mathematical analysis of them has scarcely been attempted. Nevertheless, strange to say, they are what we are visually most sensitive to, all of us, animals, babies, men, women, and moviegoers.

研究者们尝试对生态事件（ecological events）进行初步分类。要研究事件的感知，我们首先需要确定什么可以被视为一个事件，然后才能描述这个事件如何改变我们看到的视觉信息。人们常常认为，现实世界中的运动必然会导致我们视野中的变化，但这个假设其实是错误的。

研究者将事件分为三类：

1. 物体表面布局的变化，例如物体的移动、旋转、碰撞、变形和破碎等。

2. 物体表面颜色或纹理的变化，比如植物和动物表面的各种微妙变化，虽然我们可能无法准确命名，但这些变化往往很重要。

3. 物体表面存在状态的变化，如蒸发、消散、融化、溶解和腐烂等过程。值得注意的是，有些变化是可逆的，但 many are not。

研究发现，生态事件通常具有以下特点：它们往往嵌套在更长的事件过程中；有些会重复发生，有些则是全新的；它们都是有意义的；并且它们的发展过程并不像牛顿所说的「绝对数学时间」那样均匀流动。

要区分这些不同类型的事件，我们需要观察视觉信息（optic array）局部结构的各种变化。研究者初步总结了几种光学变化类型：消失-出现、剪切、变换、放大-缩小、变形、消失和替换。这些变化类型目前研究得还不多，相关的数学分析也几乎还是空白。然而，有趣的是，这些正是我们视觉系统最敏感的内容，无论是动物、婴儿、成年人，还是电影观众，都对这些变化极为敏感。
