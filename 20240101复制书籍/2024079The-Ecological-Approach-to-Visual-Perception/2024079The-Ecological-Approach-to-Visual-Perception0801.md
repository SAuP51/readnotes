## 0801. The Theory of Affordances

I have described the environment as the surfaces that separate substances from the medium in which the animals live. But I have also described what the environment affords animals, mentioning the terrain, shelters, water, fire, objects, tools, other animals, and human displays. How do we go from surfaces to affordances? And if there is information in light for the perception of surfaces, is there information for the perception of what they afford? Perhaps the composition and layout of surfaces constitute what they afford. If so, to perceive them is to perceive what they afford. This is a radical hypothesis, for it implies that the "values" and "meanings" of things in the environment can be directly perceived. Moreover, it would explain the sense in which values and meanings are external to the perceiver.

The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. The verb to afford is found in the dictionary, but the noun affordance is not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment. The antecedents of the term and the history of the concept will be treated later; for the present, let us consider examples of an affordance.

If a terrestrial surface is nearly horizontal (instead of slanted), nearly flat (instead of convex or concave), and sufficiently extended (relative to the size of the animal) and if its substance is rigid (relative to the weight of the animal), then the surface affords support. It is a surface of support, and we call it a substratum, ground, or floor. It is stand-on-able, permitting an upright posture for quadrupeds and bipeds. It is therefore walk-on-able and run-over-able. It is not sink-into-able like a surface of water or a swamp, that is, not for heavy terrestrial animals. Support for water bugs is different.

Note that the four properties listed-horizontal, flat, extended, and rigid- would be physical properties of a surface if they were measured with the scales and standard units used in physics. As an affordance of support for a species of animal, however, they have to be measured relative to the animal. They are unique for that animal. They are not just abstract physical properties. They have unity relative to the posture and behavior of the animal being considered. So an affordance cannot be measured as we measure in physics.

Terrestrial surfaces, of course, are also climb-on-able or fall-off-able or get-underneath-able or bump-into-able relative to the animal. Different layouts afford different behaviors for different animals, and different mechanical encounters. The human species in some cultures has the habit of sitting as distinguished from kneeling or squatting. If a surface of support with the four properties is also knee-high above the ground, it affords sitting on. We call it a seat in general, or a stool, bench, chair, and so on, in particular. It may be natural like a ledge or artificial like a couch. It may have various shapes, as long as its functional layout is that of a seat. The color and texture of the surface are irrelevant. Knee-high for a child is not the same as knee-high for an adult, so the affordance is relative to the size of the individual. But if a surface is horizontal, flat, extended, rigid, and knee-high relative to a perceiver, it can in fact be sat upon. If it can be discriminated as having just these properties, it should look sit-on-able. If it does, the affordance is perceived visually. If the surface properties are seen relative to the body surfaces, the self, they constitute a seat and have meaning.

There could be other examples. The different substances of the environment have different affordances for nutrition and for manufacture. The different objects of the environment have different affordances for manipulation. The other animals afford, above all, a rich and complex set of interactions, sexual, predatory, nurturing, fighting, playing, cooperating, and communicating. What other persons afford, comprises the whole realm of social significance for human beings. We pay the closest attention to the optical and acoustic information that specifies what the other person is, invites, threatens, and does.

可供性理论

我之前提到过，环境是物质与动物生活的介质之间的分界面。同时，我还描述了环境为动物提供的各种条件，比如地形、庇护所、水源、火源、物体、工具、其他动物和人类展示等。那么，我们是如何从这些分界面理解到环境的可供性的呢？如果光线中的信息能让我们感知到这些表面，那么是否也能让我们感知到它们的用途呢？或许表面的组成和布局就代表了它们的可供性。如果真是这样，感知这些表面就意味着感知它们的可供性。这一假设很大胆，因为它暗示环境中事物的「价值」和「意义」可以被直接感知。此外，这还解释了这些价值和意义为何是外在于感知者的。

环境的可供性指的是它为动物提供的条件，无论是好是坏。虽然「提供」这个动词在字典中可以找到，但「可供性」这个名词是我创造的。我用这个词来描述一种既包含环境又包含动物的关系，现有的术语无法准确表达。这意味着动物与环境之间是互补的。关于这个术语的来源和概念历史，我们稍后再讨论；现在，让我们先看一个可供性的例子。

如果地表是几乎水平的（而不是倾斜的）、几乎平坦的（而不是凸起或凹陷的），并且相对于动物的体型来说足够宽广，并且其材质对动物的重量来说是刚性的，那么这个地表就能提供支撑。它就是一个支撑面，我们称之为地基、地面或地板。它能够让四足动物和两足动物保持直立姿势，也就是说，它可以行走和奔跑。它不像水面或沼泽那样会下沉，至少对于重的陆地动物来说是这样的。而水生昆虫的支撑情况则不同。

需要注意的是，这四个特性 —— 水平、平坦、宽广和刚性 —— 如果用物理学中的标准单位来测量，它们是表面的物理属性。然而，作为支撑某种动物的能力，它们必须相对于动物来测量。对于该动物来说，这些特性是独特的，不仅仅是抽象的物理属性。它们相对于该动物的姿势和行为具有整体性。因此，支撑能力不能像我们在物理学中那样测量。

陆地表面对于动物来说，可以攀爬、跌落、钻到下面或撞到。不同的地形布局会导致不同动物的行为和机械接触。人类在某些文化中习惯坐着，而不是跪着或蹲着。如果一个支撑面既水平又平坦、延展、坚硬，并且高度适合膝盖，那它就适合坐。我们称这种支撑面为座位，具体可以是凳子、长椅、椅子等。它可能是天然的，如岩架，也可能是人造的，如沙发。只要它的功能布局是座位，形状和表面颜色、质地都无关紧要。对孩子来说的膝盖高度和对成年人来说的膝盖高度不同，因此座位的适用性也因个体大小而异。如果一个表面具有这些特性，并且看起来适合坐，那么它就可以通过视觉感知成为座位，并具有意义。

还有其他例子。环境中的不同物质对营养和制造有不同的用途。环境中的不同物体对操作有不同的功能。其他动物提供了丰富而复杂的互动，包括性行为、捕食、养育、战斗、玩耍、合作和交流。其他人提供的互动构成了人类社会的全部意义。我们最关注的是光学和声学信息，这些信息告诉我们其他人是谁、在做什么、邀请什么或威胁什么。

### 8.1 The Niches of the Environment

Ecologists have the concept of a niche. A species of animal is said to utilize or occupy a certain niche in the environment. This is not quite the same as the habitat of the species; a niche refers more to how an animal lives than to where it lives. I suggest that a niche is a set of affordances.

The natural environment offers many ways of life, and different animals have different ways of life. The niche implies a kind of animal, and the animal implies a kind of niche. Note the complementarity of the two. But note also that the environment as a whole with its unlimited possibilities existed prior to animals. The physical, chemical, meteorological, and geological conditions of the surface of the earth and the pre-existence of plant life are what make animal life possible. They had to be invariant for animals to evolve.

There are all kinds of nutrients in the world and all sorts of ways of getting food; all sorts of shelters or hiding places, such as holes, crevices, and caves; all sorts of materials for making shelters, nests, mounds, huts; all kinds of loco- motion that the environment makes possible, such as swimming, crawling, walking, climbing, flying. These offerings have been taken advantage of; the niches have been occupied. But, for all we know, there may be many offerings of the environment that have not been taken advantage of, that is, niches not yet occupied.

In architecture a niche is a place that is suitable for a piece of statuary, a place into which the object fits. In ecology a niche is a setting of environmental features that are suitable for an animal, into which it fits metaphorically.

An important fact about the affordances of the environment is that they are in a sense objective, real, and physical, unlike values and meanings, which are often supposed to be subjective, phenomenal, and mental. But, actually, an affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior. It is both physical and psychical, yet neither. An affordance points both ways, to the environment and to the observer.

The niche for a certain species should not be confused with what some animal psychologists have called the phenomenal environment of the species. This can be taken erroneously to be the "private world" in which the species is supposed to live, the "subjective world," or the world of "consciousness."The behavior of observers depends on their perception of the environment, surely enough, but this does not mean that their behavior depends on a so-called private or subjective or conscious environment. The organism depends on its environment for its life, but the environment does not depend on the organism for its existence.

环境的生态位

生态学家提出了「生态位」的概念。一个动物物种被认为占据了环境中的某个生态位。生态位不同于栖息地；它更多指的是动物的生活方式，而不是它们生活的地点。我认为，生态位可以看作是一组环境提供的机遇。

自然环境提供了多种多样的生活方式，不同的动物有各自不同的生活方式。生态位和动物之间存在互补关系：一种动物意味着一种生态位，一种生态位也意味着一种动物。但需要注意的是，地球上的物理、化学、气象和地质条件，以及植物生命的存在，早在动物出现之前就已经存在，并且这些条件在动物进化过程中是相对不变的。

地球上有各种营养物质和获取食物的方式；各种避难所或藏身之处，如洞穴、裂缝和山洞；各种建造避难所、巢穴、土丘和小屋的材料；环境还提供了各种运动方式，如游泳、爬行、行走、攀爬和飞行。这些资源被动物们充分利用，生态位也因此被占据。然而，环境中可能还存在许多未被利用的资源，即尚未被占据的生态位。

在建筑学中，生态位指的是适合放置雕像的位置，一个物体能够恰好适应的地方。在生态学中，生态位则是指适合某种动物的环境特点，动物能够在其中找到适合自己的生存方式。

一个关于环境可供性（affordance）的重要事实是，它们在某种意义上是客观、真实和物理的，而不像价值和意义那样被认为是主观的、现象的和精神的。实际上，可供性既不是单纯的客观属性，也不是单纯的主观属性；或者可以说，它是两者兼具的。可供性打破了主观和客观的对立，帮助我们理解这种对立的不足。它既是环境的事实，也是行为的事实。既有物理属性，也有心理属性，但又不完全是其中任何一种。可供性同时指向环境和观察者。

某个物种的生态位不应与一些动物心理学家所称的物种的现象环境混淆。后者可能被错误地理解为物种所生活的「私人世界」、「主观世界」或「意识世界」。尽管观察者的行为确实依赖于他们对环境的感知，但这并不意味着他们的行为依赖于所谓的私人、主观或意识环境。生物体依赖环境生存，但环境的存在并不依赖于生物体。

### 8.2 Man's Alteration of the Natural Environment

In the last few thousand years, as everybody now realizes, the very face of the earth has been modified by man. The layout of surfaces has been changed, by cutting, clearing, leveling, paving, and building. Natural deserts and moun- tains, swamps and rivers, forests and plains still exist, but they are being encroached upon and reshaped by man-made layouts. Moreover, the substances of the environment have been partly converted from the natural materials of the earth into various kinds of artificial materials such as bronze, iron, concrete, and bread. Even the medium of the environment-the air for us and the water for fish-is becoming slowly altered despite the restorative cycles that yielded a steady state for millions of years prior to man.

Why has man changed the shapes and substances of his environment? To change what it affords him. He has made more available what benefits him and less pressing what injures him. In making life easier for himself, of course, he has made life harder for most of the other animals. Over the millennia, he has made it easier for himself to get food, easier to keep warm, easier to see at night, easier to get about, and easier to train his offspring.

This is not a new environment-an artificial environment distinct from the natural environment-but the same old environment modified by man. It is a mistake to separate the natural from the artificial as if there were two environments; artifacts have to be manufactured from natural substances. It is also a mistake to separate the cultural environment from the natural environment, as if there were a world of mental products distinct from the world of material products. There is only one world, however diverse, and all animals live in it, although we human animals have altered it to suit ourselves. We have done so wastefully, thoughtlessly, and, if we do not mend our ways, fatally.

The fundamentals of the environment--the substances, the medium, and the surfaces-are the same for all animals. No matter how powerful men become they are not going to alter the fact of earth, air, and water-the litho- sphere, the atmosphere, and the hydrosphere, together with the interfaces that separate them. For terrestrial animals like us, the earth and the sky are a basic structure on which all lesser structures depend. We cannot change it. We all fit into the substructures of the environment in our various ways, for we were all, in fact, formed by them. We were created by the world we live in.

人类对自然环境的改变

在过去的几千年里，地球的面貌在不断地被人类改变。通过切割、清理、平整、铺设和建筑，人类改变了地球的地表布局。尽管自然的沙漠、山脉、沼泽、河流、森林和平原依然存在，但它们正逐渐被人工布局侵蚀和改造。此外，环境中的物质也部分从天然材料转变为人造材料，如青铜、铁、混凝土和面包。甚至环境的介质 —— 对我们来说是空气，对鱼来说是水 —— 也在慢慢改变，尽管在人类出现之前的几百万年里，恢复循环曾经使环境保持稳定。

为什么人类要改变环境的形状和物质？为了改变环境对他的供给。他让对自己有利的资源变得更容易获取，减少了对自己有害的因素。当然，这使得其他大多数动物的生活变得更加艰难。几千年来，人类让自己更容易获得食物、更容易保暖、更容易在夜间看见、更容易行动、更容易教育后代。

这并不是一个全新的环境 —— 一个与自然环境截然不同的人工环境 —— 而是同一个被人类改造过的旧环境。将自然和人工环境分开是错误的，因为人工制品必须由天然物质制作。同样，将文化环境和自然环境分开也是错误的，因为精神产品和物质产品并无本质区别。无论多么多样化，这个世界只有一个，所有动物都生活在其中，尽管我们人类已经为适应自己而改变了它。我们这样做既浪费又轻率，如果不改变我们的方式，后果将是致命的。

环境的基本要素 —— 物质、介质和表面 —— 对所有动物来说都是相同的。无论人类多么强大，他们都无法改变地球、大气和水 —— 也就是岩石圈、大气圈和水圈，以及将它们分隔开的界面。对于我们这样的陆地动物来说，地球和天空是所有其他结构赖以存在的基础。我们无法改变这一点。我们都以不同的方式适应环境的各种子结构，因为我们实际上都是由它们塑造的。我们是由我们生活的世界创造的。

### 8.3 Some Affordances of the Terrestrial Environment

Let us consider the affordances of the medium, of substances, of surfaces and their layout, of objects, of animals and persons, and finally a case of special interest for ecological optics, the affording of concealmeant by the occluding edges of the environment (Chapter 5).

陆地环境的一些可供性

让我们考虑一下介质、物质、表面及其布局、物体、动物和人，以及一个对生态光学特别感兴趣的案例，即环境的遮蔽边缘提供的隐藏能力（第五章）。

The Medium

Air affords breathing, more exactly, respiration. It also affords unimpeded loco- motion relative to the ground, which affords support. When illuminated and fog-free, it affords visual perception. It also affords the perception of vibratory events by means of sound fields and the perception of volatile sources by means of odor fields. The airspaces between obstacles and objects are the paths and the places where behavior occurs.

The optical information to specify air when it is clear and transparent is not obvious. The problem came up in Chapter 4, and the experimental evidence about the seeing of "nothing" will be described in the next chapter.

介质

空气提供呼吸，更确切地说，是呼吸作用。它还提供了相对于地面的自由运动，地面则提供了支撑。当空气被照亮且无雾时，它提供了视觉感知。空气还通过声场传递振动事件，通过气味场传递挥发性物质的感知。障碍物和物体之间的空气空间是行为发生的路径和场所。

在空气清晰和透明时，识别空气的光学信息并不明显。这个问题在第四章中提出，关于「看不见的东西」的实验证据将在下一章中描述。

The Substances

Water is more substantial than air and always has a surface with air. It does not afford respiration for us. It affords drinking. Being fluid, it affords pouring from a container. Being a solvent, it affords washing and bathing. Its surface does not afford support for large animals with dense tissues. The optical information for water is well specified by the characteristics of its surface, especially the unique fluctuations caused by rippling (Chapter 5).

Solid substances, more substantial than water, have characteristic surfaces (Chapter 2). Depending on the animal species, some afford nutrition and some do not. A few are toxic. Fruits and berries, for example, have more food value when they are ripe, and this is specified by the color of the surface. But the food values of substances are often misperceived.

Solids also afford various kinds of manufacture, depending on the kind of solid state. Some, such as flint, can be chipped; others, such as clay, can be molded; still others recover their original shape after deformation; and some resist deformation strongly. Note that manufacture, as the term implies, was originally a form of manual behavior like manipulation. Things were fabric- ated by hand. To identify the substance in such cases is to perceive what can be done with it, what it is good for, its utility; and the hands are involved.

物质

水比空气更具实质性，并且总是有一个与空气接触的表面。虽然它不能供我们呼吸，但它能供我们饮用。作为流体，它可以从容器中倒出；作为溶剂，它可以用来洗涤和沐浴。然而，其表面无法支撑体型较大、组织密度高的动物。水的光学特性主要由其表面特征决定，尤其是由于波纹引起的独特波动（第 5 章）。

比水更具实质性的固体物质有其特征性表面（第 2 章）。对于不同的动物物种，有些固体物质能提供营养，而有些则不能，甚至有些是有毒的。例如，水果和浆果在成熟时的食物价值更高，这可以通过表面的颜色来判断。然而，人们常常误解物质的实际食物价值。

固体物质还可以根据其种类提供不同的制造方式。有些，如燧石，可以被切割；有些，如粘土，可以被塑造；还有一些在变形后可以恢复原状；而有些则非常抗变形。需要注意的是，「制造」一词最初指的是手工操作。识别物质在这种情况下意味着理解它可以做什么，有什么用处，这其中手的作用是不可忽视的。

The Surfaces and their Layouts

I have already said that a horizontal, flat, extended, rigid surface affords support. It permits equilibrium and the maintaining of a posture with respect to gravity, this being a force perpendicular to the surface. The animal does not fall or slide as it would on a steep hillside. Equilibrium and posture are prerequisite to other behaviors, such as locomotion and manipulation. There will be more about this in Chapter 12, and more evidence about the perception of the ground in Chapter 9. The ground is quite literally the basis of the behavior of land animals. And it is also the basis of their visual perception, their so- called space perception. Geometry began with the study of the earth as abstracted by Euclid, not with the study of the axes of empty space as abstracted by Descartes. The affording of support and the geometry of a horizontal plane are therefore not in different realms of discourse; they are not as separate as we have supposed.

The flat earth, of course, lies beneath the attached and detached objects on it. The earth has"furniture," or as I have said, it is cluttered. The solid, level, flat surface extends behind the clutter and, in fact, extends all the way out to the horizon. This is not, of course, the earth of Copernicus; it is the earth at the scale of the human animal, and on that scale it is flat, not round. Wherever one goes, the earth is separated from the sky by a horizon that, although it may be hidden by the clutter, is always there. There will be evidence to show that the horizon can always be seen, in the sense that it can be visualized, and that it can always be felt, in the sense that any surface one touches is experienced in relation to the horizontal plane.

Of course, a horizontal, flat, extended surface that is nonrigid, a stream or lake, does not afford support for standing, or for walking and running. There is no footing, as we say. It may afford floating or swimming, but you have to be equipped for that, by nature or by learning.

A vertical, flat, extended, and rigid surface such as a wall or a cliff face is a barrier to pedestrian locomotion. Slopes between vertical and horizontal afford walking, if easy, but only climbing, if steep, and in the latter case the surface cannot be flat; there must be "holds"for the hands and feet. Similarly, a slope downward affords falling if steep; the brink of a cliff is a falling-off place. It is dangerous and looks dangerous. The affordance of a certain layout is perceived if the layout is perceived.

Civilized people have altered the steep slopes of their habitat by building stairways so as to afford ascent and descent. What we call the steps afford stepping, up or down, relative to the size of the person's legs. We are still capable of getting around in an arboreal layout of surfaces, tree branches, and we have ladders that afford this kind of locomotion, but most of us leave that to our children.

A cliff face, a wall, a chasm, and a stream are barriers; they do not afford pedestrian locomotion unless there is a door, a gate, or a bridge. A tree or a rock is an obstacle. Ordinarily, there are paths between obstacles, and these openings are visible. The progress of locomotion is guided by the perception of barriers and obstacles, that is, by the act of steering into the openings and away from the surfaces that afford injury. I have tried to describe the optical information for the control of locomotion (Gibson, 1958), and it will be further elaborated in Chapter 13. The imminence of collision with a surface during loco- motion is specified in a particularly simple way, by an explosive rate of magnification of the optical texture. This has been called looming (e.g., Schiff, 1965). It should not be confused, however, with the magnification of an opening between obstacles, the opening up of a vista such as occurs in the approach to a doorway.

表面及其布局

我曾提到，水平、平坦、扩展且坚固的表面可以提供支撑。它使得物体在重力作用下能够保持平衡和姿态，因为重力是垂直于表面的力。动物不会像在陡峭的山坡上那样摔倒或滑动。平衡和姿态是其他行为（如移动和操作）的前提条件。第 12 章会详细讨论这个问题，第 9 章则会提供更多关于地面感知的证据。地面确实是陆地动物行为的基础，也是它们视觉感知或所谓空间感知的基础。几何学起源于欧几里得对地球的抽象研究，而不是笛卡尔对空旷空间轴线的抽象。因此，支撑的提供和水平面的几何学并不是不同的讨论领域；它们并不像我们想象的那样分离。

当然，平坦的地面在其上的附着和分离的物体之下。地面上有各种「家具」，也可以说是杂乱无章的。这些坚固、平坦的表面延伸到杂物的背后，并一直延伸到地平线。当然，这不是哥白尼所描述的地球，而是以人类尺度来看，它是平的而不是圆的。无论走到哪里，地面总是被地平线与天空分隔开来，尽管地平线可能被杂物遮挡，但它始终存在。有证据表明，地平线总是可以被看到的，不仅可以在视觉上想象到它，还可以通过触觉感知到，因为任何你触摸的表面都与水平面有关系。

当然，像溪流或湖泊这样水平、平坦但非刚性的表面，并不能支撑站立、行走或奔跑。它们没有立足点，如我们所说。但它们可以提供漂浮或游泳的机会，不过这需要你天生具备或通过学习获得这种能力。

垂直的、平坦的、延伸的刚性表面，比如墙壁或悬崖，则会阻碍行走。介于垂直与水平之间的斜坡，如果平缓，可以行走；如果陡峭，只能攀爬，而且此时表面必须有手脚可以抓住的「握点」。同样，向下的陡坡会导致摔倒，悬崖边缘是一个危险的掉落点，看着就让人害怕。如果我们能够感知到某种地形布局，就能感知到它提供的行动可能性。

为了方便上坡和下坡，文明社会的人们通过建造楼梯来改造陡坡。台阶的高度和人的腿长相适应，提供了上下行走的可能性。我们仍然能够在树枝等表面上移动，并且有梯子辅助这种移动方式，但大多数人把这种活动留给了孩子们。

悬崖、墙壁、深渊和溪流是行人无法通过的障碍，除非有门、栅栏或桥梁。树木或岩石则是行进中的障碍物。通常情况下，障碍物之间都有可见的路径。人们通过感知这些障碍和障碍物，选择合适的开口来前进，避免碰到可能导致受伤的表面。我曾尝试描述控制行进的光学信息（Gibson, 1958)，并将在第 13 章详细说明。当行进中即将碰到某个表面时，这种紧迫感可以通过光学纹理的迅速放大来感知，这被称为「逼近」（例如，Schiff, 1965）。但这与障碍物之间开口的放大不同，比如接近门口时视野开阔的感觉。

The Objects

The affordances of what we loosely call objects are extremely various. It will be recalled that my use of the terms is restricted and that I distinguish between attached objects and detached objects. We are not dealing with Newtonian objects in space, all of which are detached, but with the furniture of the earth, some items of which are attached to it and cannot be moved without breakage.

Detached objects must be comparable in size to the animal under consider- ation if they are to afford behavior. But those that are comparable afford an astonishing variety of behaviors, especially to animals with hands. Objects can be manufactured and manipulated. Some are portable in that they afford lifting and carrying, while others are not. Some are graspable and other not. To be graspable, an object must have opposite surfaces separated by a distance less than the span of the hand. A five-inch cube can be grasped, but a ten-inch cube cannot (Gibson, 1966b, p. 119). A large object needs a "handle" to afford grasping. Note that the size of an object that constitutes a graspable size is specified in the optic array. If this is true, it is not true that a tactual sensation of size has to become associated with the visual sensation of size in order for the affordance to be perceived.

Sheets, sticks, fibers, containers, clothing, and tools are detached objects that afford manipulation (Chapter 3). Additional examples are given below.

1. An elongated object of moderate size and weight affords wielding. If used to hit or strike, it is a club or hammer. If used by a chimpanzee behind bars to pull in a banana beyond its reach, it is a sort of rake. In either case, it is an extension of the arm. A rigid staff also affords leverage and in that use is a lever. A pointed elongated object affords piercing--if large it is is a spear, if small a needle or awl.

2. A rigid object with a sharp dihedral angle, an edge, affords cutting and scraping; it is a knife. It may be designed for both striking and cutting, and then it is an axe.

3. A graspable rigid object of moderate size and weight affords throwing. It may be a missile or only an object for play, a ball. The launching of missiles by supplementary tools other than the hands alone-the sling, the bow, the cata- pult, the gun, and so on-is one of the behaviors that makes the human animal a nasty, dangerous species.

4. An elongated elastic object, such as a fiber, thread, thong, or rope, affords knotting, binding, lashing, knitting, and weaving. These are kinds of behavior where manipulation leads to manufacture.

5. A hand-held tool of enormous importance is one that, when applied to a surface, leaves traces and thus affords trace-making. The tool may be a stylus, brush, crayon, pen, or pencil, but if it marks the surface it can be used to depict and to write, to represent scenes and to specify words.

We have thousands of names for such objects, and we classify them in many ways: pliers and wrenches are tools; pots and pans are utensils; swords and pistols are weapons. They can all be said to have properties or qualities: color, texture, composition, size, shape and features of shape, mass, elasticity, rigidity, and mobility. Orthodox psychology asserts that we perceive these objects insofar as we discriminate their properties or qualities. Psychologists carry out elegant experiments in the laboratory to find out how and how well these qualities are discrimin- ated. The psychologists assume that objects are composed of their qualities. But I now suggest that what we perceive when we look at objects are their afford- ances, not their qualities. We can discriminate the dimensions of difference if required to do so in an experiment, but what the object affords us is what we normally pay attention to. The special combination of qualities into which an object can be analyzed is ordinarily not noticed.

If this is true for the adult, what about the young child? There is much evid- ence to show that the infant does not begin by first discriminating the qualities of objects and then learning the combinations of qualities that specify them. Phenomenal objects are not built up of qualities; it is the other way around. The affordance of an object is what the infant begins by noticing. The meaning is observed before the substance and surface, the color and form, are seen as such. An affordance is an invariant combination of variables, and one might guess that it is easier to perceive such an invariant unit than it is to perceive all the variables separately. It is never necessary to distinguish all the features of an object and, in fact, it would be impossible to do so. Perception is economical. "Those features of a thing are noticed which distinguish it from other things that it is not-but not all the features that distinguish it from everything that it is not"(Gibson, 1966b, p. 286).

物体

所谓物体的利用性质非常多样。我使用这些术语时有严格的限定，并区分了附着物体和分离物体。这里我们讨论的不是牛顿物理中的独立物体，而是地球上的家具，其中一些是固定在地面上的，不能随意移动。

如果要让分离的物体能够被动物使用，其大小必须与动物的大小相当。但这些相当大小的物体，特别是对于有手的动物来说，可以带来各种各样的行为。物体可以被制造和操控。有些物体是便携的，可以被提起和携带，而有些则不是。有些物体可以被抓握，而有些则不能。要能够被抓握，物体必须有两个相对的表面，且它们之间的距离小于手的跨度。例如，一个五英寸的立方体可以被抓握，而一个十英寸的立方体则不行（Gibson, 1966b, p. 119)。较大的物体需要一个「把手」才能被抓握。注意，一个物体是否具备可抓握的尺寸是在视觉阵列中确定的。如果这是真的，那么触觉的大小感受不必与视觉的大小感受联系起来，就能感知到这种行为机会。

薄片、棍子、纤维、容器、衣物和工具是提供操作机会的分离物体（第 3 章）。以下是更多的例子。

1、一个中等大小和重量的细长物体可以被挥动。如果用来击打，它是一个棍棒或锤子。如果被笼子里的黑猩猩用来拉进超出其范围的香蕉，它是一种耙子。在任何情况下，它都是手臂的延伸。一根坚硬的杆子也可以用作杠杆。一个尖的细长物体可以用来刺穿 —— 如果大，它是矛，如果小则是针或锥子。

2、一个具有尖锐二面角和边缘的坚硬物体可以用来切割和刮擦；它是一把刀。它可以被设计成既能击打又能切割，然后它就是一把斧头。

3、一个中等大小和重量的可抓握坚硬物体可以被投掷。它可以是一个导弹或只是一个玩具，比如一个球。通过手以外的辅助工具发射导弹 —— 如弹弓、弓、投石机、枪等等 —— 是人类成为一种危险物种的行为之一。

4、细长的弹性物体，例如纤维、线、皮带或绳子，可以用来打结、捆绑、捆扎、编织和编织。这些行为通过操作来实现制造目的。

5、一种非常重要的手持工具是能够在表面留下痕迹的工具，例如触笔、刷子、蜡笔、钢笔或铅笔。这些工具可以用来描绘和书写，表示场景和文字。

我们有成千上万的名称来命名这些物体，并且以多种方式对它们进行分类：钳子和扳手是工具；锅和锅是器皿；剑和手枪是武器。这些物体都有自身的属性或特点：颜色、纹理、成分、尺寸、形状及其特征、质量、弹性、刚性和移动性。传统心理学认为，我们之所以感知到这些物体，是因为我们能够区分它们的属性或特点。心理学家在实验室中进行精细的实验，以探明这些属性如何以及多大程度上被区分。心理学家认为，物体是由这些属性组成的。但我现在建议，当我们观察物体时，感知到的是它们的功能，而不是它们的属性。在实验中我们可以区分这些差异的维度，但在日常生活中，我们通常关注的是物体的功能，而不是它们的具体属性组合。

如果这是成年人感知世界的方式，那么幼儿是怎样的呢？大量证据表明，婴儿不是先区分物体的各种属性，然后再学习这些属性的组合。相反，婴儿首先注意到的是物体的可供性（affordance)。在看到物体的物质、表面、颜色和形状之前，婴儿已经理解了它的意义。可供性是一种不变的变量组合，人们可以猜测，感知这种不变的单元比分别感知所有变量要容易得多。实际上，区分一个物体的所有特征既没有必要，也是不可能的。感知是经济的，正如 Gibson 所说：「我们注意到的特征是将一个物体与其他不同事物区分开的特征，但不包括所有可能的区别特征」(Gibson, 1966b, p. 286)。

TO PERCEIVE AN AFFORDANCE IS NOT TO CLASSIFY AN OBJECT

The fact that a stone is a missile does not imply that it cannot be other things as well. It can be a paperweight, a bookend, a hammer, or a pendulum bob. It can be piled on another rock to make a cairn or a stone wall. These affordances are all consistent with one another. The differences between them are not clear-cut, and the arbitrary names by which they are called do not count for perception. If you know what can be done with a graspable detached object, what it can be used for, you can call it whatever you please.

The theory of affordances rescues us from the philosophical muddle of assuming fixed classes of objects, each defined by its common features and then given a name. As Ludwig Wittgenstein knew, you cannot specify the necessary and sufficient features of the class of things to which a name is given. They have only a "family resemblance." But this does not mean you cannot learn how to use things and perceive their uses. You do not have to classify and label things in order to perceive what they afford.

感知一个物体的可供性并不等同于对它进行分类

一个石头可以作为投掷物，但这并不意味着它不能有其他用途。它可以用作镇纸、书挡、锤子，甚至是钟摆。它还能堆在另一块石头上形成石堆或石墙。这些不同的用途都是一致的，它们之间的界限并不明显，而且这些名称对于感知来说并不重要。如果你知道某个可抓取的物体可以用来做什么，你可以随意称呼它。

物的可供性理论（theory of affordances）解救了我们，使我们摆脱了假设固定的物体类别的哲学困境，这些类别通常是通过其共同特征来定义并给予名称的。正如 Ludwig Wittgenstein 所言，你无法指定给予某个名称的物品类别的必要和充分特征。它们只有一种「家族相似性」(family resemblance)。但这并不意味着你不能学会如何使用物品并感知它们的用途。你不需要对物品进行分类和标记才能感知它们的可供性。

Other Persons and Animals

The richest and most elaborate affordances of the environment are provided by other animals and, for us, other people. These are, of course, detached objects with topologically closed surfaces, but they change the shape of their surfaces while yet retaining the same fundamental shape. They move from place to place, changing the postures of their bodies, ingesting and emitting certain substances, and doing all this spontaneously, initiating their own movements, which is to say that their movements are animate. These bodies are subject to the laws of mechanics and yet not subject to the laws of mechanics, for they are not governed by these laws. They are so different from ordinary objects that infants learn almost immediately to distinguish them from plants and nonliving things. When touched they touch back, when struck they strike back; in short, they interact with the observer and with one another. Behavior affords behavior, and the whole subject matter of psychology and of the social sciences can be thought of as an elaboration of this basic fact. Sexual behavior, nurturing behavior, fighting behavior, cooperative behavior, economic behavior, political behavior-all depend on the perceiving of what another person or other persons afford, or sometimes on the misperceiving of it.

What the male affords the female is reciprocal to what the female affords the male; what the infant affords the mother is reciprocal to what the mother affords the infant; what the prey affords the predator goes along with what the predator affords the prey; what the buyer affords the seller cannot be separated from what the seller affords the buyer, and so on. The perceiving of these mutual affordances is enormously complex, but it is nonetheless lawful, and it is based on the pickup of the information in touch, sound, odor, taste, and ambient light. It is just as much based on stimulus information as is the simpler perception of the support that is offered by the ground under one's feet. For other animals and other persons can only give off information about themselves insofar as they are tangible, audible, odorous, tastable, or visible.

The other person, the generalized other, the alter as opposed to the ego, is an ecological object with a skin, even if clothed. It is an object, although it is not merely an object, and we do right to speak of he or she instead of it. But the other person has a surface that reflects light, and the information to specify what he or she is, invites, promises, threatens, or does can be found in the light.

其他人和动物

环境中最丰富和复杂的互动是由其他动物和我们人类提供的。尽管这些生物有着封闭的表面，但它们可以改变表面形状，同时保持基本形态。它们会移动位置，改变身体姿势，摄取和排放物质，并自发地进行这些活动，这意味着它们的运动是有生命的。这些生物虽然遵循力学定律，但又不完全受其约束，因为它们的行为并不完全由这些定律支配。它们与普通的物体截然不同，婴儿几乎立即能够将它们与植物和非生物区分开来。当你触摸它们时，它们会有所反应；当你打击它们时，它们会反击。总之，它们能够与观察者和彼此互动。行为引发行为，心理学和社会科学的研究内容可以看作是对这一基本事实的详细探讨。性行为、养育行为、攻击行为、合作行为、经济行为和政治行为都依赖于对他人行为的感知，或者有时是对其的误解。

雄性与雌性之间，婴儿与母亲之间，猎物与捕食者之间，买方与卖方之间的相互关系都是互惠的。这些互惠关系虽然复杂，但遵循一定的规律，并且基于触觉、声音、气味、味道和环境光中的信息获取。这与我们感知脚下地面的支撑一样，都是基于刺激信息。因为动物和人只有在它们是可以触摸、听见、闻到、尝到或看到的情况下，才能提供关于它们自己的信息。

他人，与自我相对的他人，是一个有皮肤的生态对象，即使穿着衣服。虽然他人不仅仅是一个对象，因此我们用「他」或「她」来称呼，而不是「它」。他人的表面反射光线，通过光线我们可以获得关于他或她的身份、邀请、承诺、威胁或行为的信息。

Places and Hiding Places

The habitat of a given animal contains places. A place is not an object with definite boundaries but a region (Chapter 3). The different places of a habitat may have different affordances. Some are places where food is usually found and others where it is not. There are places of danger, such as the brink of a cliff and the regions where predators lurk. There are places of refuge from predators. Among these is the place where mate and young are, the home, which is usually a partial enclosure. Animals are skilled at what the psychologist calls place-learning. They can find their way to significant places.

An important kind of place, made intelligible by the ecological approach to visual perception, is a place that affords concealment, a hiding place. Note that it involves social perception and raises questions of epistemology. The concealing of oneself from other observers and the hiding of a detached object from other observers have different kinds of motivation. As every child discovers, a good hiding place for one's body is not necessarily a good hiding place for a treasure. A detached object can be concealed both from other observers and from the observer himself. The observer's body can be concealed from other observers but not from himself, as the last chapter emphasized. Animals as well as children hide themselves and also hide objects such as food.

One of the laws of the ambient optic array (Chapter 5)is that at any fixed point of observation some parts of the environment are revealed and the remaining parts are concealed. The reciprocal of this law is that the observer himself, his body considered as part of the environment, is revealed at some fixed points of observation and concealed at the remaining points. An observer can perceive not only that other observers are unhidden or hidden from him but also that he is hidden or unhidden from other observers. Surely, babies playing peek-a-boo and children playing hide-and-seek are practicing this kind of apprehension. To hide is to position one's body at a place that is concealed at the points of observation of other observers. A"good" hiding place is one that is concealed at nearly all points of observation.

All of these facts and many more depend on the principle of occluding edges at a point of observation, the law of reversible occlusion, and the facts of opaque and nonopaque substances. What we call privacy in the design of housing, for example, is the providing of opaque enclosures. A high degree of concealment is afforded by an enclosure, and complete concealment is afforded by a complete enclosure. But note that there are peepholes and screens that permit seeing without being seen. A transparent sheet of glass in a window transmits both illumination and information, whereas a translucent sheet transmits illumination but not information. There will be more of this in Chapter 11.

Note also that a glass wall affords seeing through but not walking through, whereas a cloth curtain affords going through but not seeing through. Architects and designers know such facts, but they lack a theory of affordances to encom-pass them in a system.

地点与藏身处

动物的栖息地包括许多地点。地点不是有明确边界的物体，而是一个区域（第 3 章）。不同地点可能提供不同的功能。有些地方通常有食物，有些地方则没有。有些地方存在危险，比如悬崖边缘和捕食者潜伏的区域。也有些地方是避难所，可以躲避捕食者，其中包括伴侣和幼崽所在的家，通常是部分封闭的。动物在「地点学习」方面非常熟练，它们可以找到通往重要地点的路。

一种重要的地方，通过生态视觉感知方法可以理解的是一个提供隐蔽的地方，一个藏身之处。需要注意的是，这涉及到社会感知并提出了认识论的问题。将自己隐藏起来和将一个独立的物体隐藏起来有不同的动机。每个孩子都会发现，一个适合藏身的地方并不一定适合藏宝物。一个独立的物体可以对其他观察者和自己隐藏，而观察者的身体只能对其他观察者隐藏，不能对自己隐藏，正如上一章所强调的。动物和孩子一样，既会隐藏自己也会隐藏物体如食物。

根据环境光学数组的定律（第 5 章)，在任何固定的观察点，一些部分是显露的，而其他部分则是隐藏的。这个定律的逆命题是，观察者自己作为环境的一部分，在一些固定的观察点上是显露的，而在其余的点上是隐藏的。观察者不仅可以感知到其他观察者是否能看到自己，还能感知到自己是否能看到其他观察者。显然，玩躲猫猫的婴儿和玩捉迷藏的孩子们正在练习这种理解。隐藏就是将自己的身体放在其他观察者看不到的地方。「好」的藏身之处是在几乎所有观察点上都是隐藏的地方。

所有这些事实以及更多的内容都依赖于观察点上的遮挡边缘原理、可逆遮挡法则以及不透明和透明物质的特性。例如，我们在住宅设计中提到的隐私，其实就是通过设置不透明的围挡来实现的。围挡可以提供高度的隐蔽，而完全封闭的围挡则可以完全遮挡视线。但要注意，有些窥视孔和屏幕可以让人看到外面，而自己不被看到。窗户上的透明玻璃既传递光线也传递信息，而半透明玻璃只传递光线却不传递信息。这些内容将在第 11 章中进一步讨论。

还要注意，玻璃墙可以让人看到外面，但不能穿过；而布帘可以穿过，却看不到外面。建筑师和设计师了解这些事实，但他们缺乏一个系统的可供性理论来涵盖这些内容。

Summary: Positive and Negative Affordances

The foregoing examples of the affordances of the environment are enough to show how general and powerful the concept is. Substances have biochemical offerings and afford manufacture. Surfaces afford posture, locomotion, collision, manipulation, and in general behavior. Special forms of layout afford shelter and concealment. Fires afford warming and burning. Detached objects- tools, utensils, weapons-afford special types of behavior to primates and humans. The other animal and the other person provide mutual and reciprocal affordances at extremely high levels of behavioral complexity. At the highest level, when vocalization becomes speech and manufactured displays become images, pictures, and writing, the affordances of human behavior are stag- gering. No more of that will be considered at this stage except to point out that speech, pictures, and writing still have to be perceived.

At all these levels, we can now observe that some offerings of the environ- ment are beneficial and some are injurious. These are slippery terms that should only be used with great care, but if their meanings are pinned down to biolo- gical and behavioral facts the danger of confusion can be minimized. First, consider substances that afford ingestion. Some afford nutrition for a given animal, some afford poisoning, and some are neutral. As I pointed out before, these facts are quite distinct from the affording of pleasure and displeasure in eating, for the experiences do not necessarily correlate with the biological effects. Second, consider the brink of a cliff. On the one side it affords walking along, locomotion, whereas on the other it affords falling off, injury. Third, consider a detached object with a sharp edge, a knife. It affords cutting if manipulated in one manner, but it affords being cut if manipulated in another manner. Similarly, but at a different level of complexity, a middle-sized metallic object affords grasping, but if charged with current it affords electric shock. And fourth, consider the other person. The animate object can give caresses or blows, contact comfort or contact injury, reward or punishment, and it is not always easy to perceive which will be provided. Note that all these benefits and injuries, these safeties and dangers, these positive and negative affordances are properties of things taken with reference to an observer but not properties of the experiences of the observer. They are not subjective values; they are not feelings of pleasure or pain added to neutral perceptions.

There has been endless debate among philosophers and psychologists as to whether values are physical or phenomenal, in the world of matter or only in the world of mind. For affordances as distinguished from values, the debate does not apply. Affordances are neither in the one world or the other inasmuch as the theory of two worlds is rejected. There is only one environment, although it contains many observers with limitless opportunities for them to live in it.

总结：可供性的正面和负面

上述环境可供性的例子已经足够显示这个概念的普遍性和强大性。物质具有生化特性，可用于制造。表面可以提供姿势、移动、碰撞、操作等行为。特定的布局形式可以提供庇护和隐藏。火可以提供取暖和燃烧。独立的物体 —— 如工具、器具和武器 —— 可以为灵长类动物和人类提供特定类型的行为。其他动物和人类能够在高度复杂的行为中提供相互和互惠的可供性。在最高层次上，当发声变成言语，制造的展示变成图像、图片和文字时，人类行为的可供性是非常惊人的。在这一阶段，我们不再深入探讨这些内容，只是要指出，言语、图片和文字仍然需要被感知。

在不同层次上，我们可以看到环境中的一些事物对我们有益，而另一些则有害。这些术语比较模糊，需要谨慎使用，但如果将其意义限定在生物和行为事实中，可以减少混淆的风险。首先，考虑一下可以摄取的物质。有些物质对特定动物有营养，有些则有毒，还有一些是中性的。正如我之前提到的，这些事实和进食时的愉悦感无关，因为这些体验不一定和生物效应对应。其次，看看悬崖的边缘。一边可以行走，而另一边则可能跌落受伤。再来，考虑一个锋利的独立物体，比如一把刀。如果以某种方式使用，它可以切割；但如果以另一种方式使用，它可能割伤自己。同样地，一个中等大小的金属物体可以握住，但如果带电，它可能会电击你。最后，考虑另一个人。这个有生命的对象可能会给你爱抚或打击，接触时感到舒适或受伤，给予奖励或惩罚，而且我们不总是能预见到会发生什么。需要注意的是，所有这些益处和伤害、安全和危险、正面和负面的提供物都是基于观察者的物体特性，而不是观察者的体验特性。它们不是主观的价值，也不是附加在中性感知上的愉悦或痛苦。

哲学家和心理学家一直在争论价值是物理存在还是精神存在，究竟在物质世界还是仅在心灵世界。但对于可供性（affordances）来说，这个争论并不适用。因为两世界理论被否定了，我们只有一个环境，尽管这个环境中有许多观察者，他们有无尽的机会在其中生活。

### 8.4 The Origin of the Concept of Affordances: A Recent History

The gestalt psychologists recognized that the meaning or the value of a thing seems to be perceived just as immediately as its color. The value is clear on the face of it, as we say, and thus it has a physiognomic quality in the way that the emotions of a man appear on his face. To quote from the Principles of Gestalt Psychology (Koffka, 1935), "Each thing says what it is a fruit says 'Eat me'; water says 'Drink me'; thunder says 'Fear me'; and woman says 'Love me (p. 7). These values are vivid and essential features of the experience itself.

Koffka did not believe that a meaning of this sort could be explained as a pale context of memory images or an unconscious set of response tendencies. The postbox "invites"the mailing of a letter, the handle "wants to be grasped,"and things "tell us what to do with them"(p. 353). Hence, they have what Koffka called "demand character."

Kurt Lewin coined the term Aufforderungscharakter, which has been translated as invitation character (by J. F. Brown in 1929) and as valence (by D. K. Adams in 1931; cf. Marrow, 1969，p. 56，for the history of these translations). The latter term came into general use. Valences for Lewin had corresponding vectors, which could be represented as arrows pushing the observer toward or away from the object. What explanation could be given for these valences, the characters of objects that invited or demanded behavior? No one, not even the gestalt theor- ists, could think of them as physical and, indeed, they do not fall within the province of ordinary physics. They must therefore be phenomenal, given the assumption of dualism. If there were two objects, and if the valence could not belong to the physical object, it must belong to the phenomenal object-to what Koffka called the "behavioral" object but not to the "geographical" object. The valence of an object was bestowed upon it in experience, and bestowed by a need of the observer. Thus, Koffka argued that the postbox has a demand character only when the observer needs to mail a letter. He is attracted to it when he has a letter to post, not otherwise. The value of something was assumed to change as the need of the observer changed.

The concept of affordance is derived from these concepts of valence, invita- tion, and demand but with a crucial difference. The affordance of something does not change as the need of the observer changes. The observer may or may not perceive or attend to the affordance, according to his needs, but the afford- ance, being invariant, is always there to be perceived. An affordance is not bestowed upon an object by a need of an observer and his act of perceiving it. The object offers what it does because it is what it is. To be sure, we define what it is in terms of ecological physics instead of physical physics, and it therefore possesses meaning and value to begin with. But this is meaning and value of a new sort.

For Koffka it was the phenomenal postbox that invited letter-mailing, not the physical postbox. But this duality is pernicious. I prefer to say that the real postbox (the only one)affords letter-mailing to a letter-writing human in a community with a postal system. This fact is perceived when the postbox is identified as such, and it is apprehended whether the postbox is in sight or out of sight. To feel a special attraction to it when one has a letter to mail is not surprising, but the main fact is that it is perceived as part of the environment as an item of the neighborhood in which we live. Everyone above the age of six knows what it is for and where the nearest one is. The perception of its afford- ance should therefore not be confused with the temporary special attraction it may have.

FIGURE 8.1 The changing perspective structure of a postbox during approach by an observer.

As one reduces the distance to the object to one-third, the visual solid angle of the object increases three times. Actually this is only a detail near the center of an outflowing optic array. (From The Perception of the Visual World by James Jerome Gibson and used with the agreement of the reprint publisher, Greenwood Press, Inc.)

The gestalt psychologists explained the directness and immediacy of the experience of valences by postulating that the ego is an object in experience and that a "tension"may arise between a phenomenal object and the phenom- enal ego. When the object is in "a dynamic relation with the ego"said Koffka, it has a demand character. Note that the "tension," the "relation," or the "vector"must arise in the"field," that is, in the field of phenomenal experience. Although many psychologists find this theory intelligible, I do not. There is an easier way of explaining why the values of things seem to be perceived imme- diately and directly. It is because the affordances of things for an observer are specified in stimulus information. They seem to be perceived directly because they are perceived directly.

The accepted theories of perception, to which the gestalt theorists were objecting, implied that no experiences were direct except sensations and that sensations mediated all other kinds of experience. Bare sensations had to be clothed with meaning. The seeming directness of meaningful perception was therefore an embarrassment to the orthodox theories, and the Gestaltists did right to emphasize it. They began to undermine the sensation-based theories. But their own explanations of why it is that a fruit says "Eat me" and a woman says "Love me"are strained. The gestalt psychologists objected to the accepted theories of perception, but they never managed to go beyond them.

可供性概念的起源：近期历史

格式塔心理学家发现，事物的意义或价值似乎和它们的颜色一样，能被立即感知。这种价值显而易见，正如我们常说的那样，它具有人脸特征，就像人的情感会表现在脸上一样。引用《格式塔心理学原理》(Koffka, 1935）中的描述，「每样东西都在告诉你它是什么：水果说‘吃我'，水说‘喝我'，雷声说‘怕我'，女人说‘爱我'(p. 7)。」这些价值是体验中生动且基本的部分。

Koffka 认为，这种意义无法简单地通过记忆图像的背景或无意识的反应解释。邮筒「邀请」你投递信件，手柄「希望」被抓住，事物都在「告诉」我们如何使用它们（p. 353)。因此，它们具有 Koffka 所称的「需求特性」。

Kurt Lewin 创造了一个术语 Aufforderungscharakter，这个词在 1929 年被 J. F. Brown 翻译为「邀请特征」，在 1931 年被 D. K. Adams 翻译为「效价」（参见 Marrow，1969，第 56 页，了解这些翻译的历史）。后者被广泛采用。对于 Lewin 来说，效价有相应的向量，可以用箭头表示，推拉观察者靠近或远离对象。那么，如何解释这些效价，即对象邀请或要求行为的特征呢？没有人，包括格式塔理论家，能将它们看作是物理现象，实际上，它们确实不属于普通物理学的范畴。因此，根据二元论的假设，它们必须是现象性的。如果有两个对象，并且效价不属于物理对象，那么它必须属于现象对象 —— 即 Koffka 所称的「行为对象」，而不是「地理对象」。对象的效价是在体验中赋予它的，由观察者的需求决定。因此，Koffka 认为，只有当观察者需要寄信时，邮筒才具有需求特征。当他有信要寄时，他才会被邮筒吸引。某物的价值被认为会随着观察者需求的变化而变化。

可供性（Affordance）这个概念源于效价、邀请和需求，但有一个关键区别。某物的可供性不会随着观察者需求的变化而改变。观察者可以根据自己的需求去感知或关注可供性，但可供性本身是恒定的，总是存在的。可供性不是由观察者的需求和感知行为赋予物体的。物体提供什么，是因为它本身的特性决定的。当然，我们用生态物理学（Ecological Physics）来定义它，而不是传统的物理学，因此它从一开始就具有新的意义和价值。

对于 Koffka 来说，是现象中的邮筒邀请了寄信，而不是实际的邮筒。但这种区分是有害的。我更倾向于说，真实的邮筒（唯一的邮筒）在有邮政系统的社区中，为写信的人提供了寄信的机会。当邮筒被识别出来时，这一事实就被感知到了，无论邮筒是否在视线范围内。当有信需要寄时，对邮筒感到特别吸引力并不奇怪，但更重要的是，它被感知为我们生活社区的一部分。每个六岁以上的人都知道它的用途和最近的邮筒在哪里。因此，对邮筒可供性的感知不应与它可能具有的暂时特殊吸引力混淆。

图 8.1 观察者接近时邮筒的视角结构变化。

当一个人将与物体的距离减少到三分之一时，物体的视觉立体角增加三倍。实际上，这只是流出光学阵列中心附近的一个细节。（摘自 James Jerome Gibson 的《视觉世界的感知》，经重印出版社 Greenwood Press, Inc. 许可使用。）

格式塔心理学家通过假设自我是经验中的一个对象，并且在现象对象和现象自我之间可能产生「紧张」来解释效价体验的直接性和即时性。Koffka 说，当对象与自我处于「动态关系」时，它具有需求特征。需要注意的是，这种「紧张」、「关系」或「向量」必须在「场」中产生，即现象体验的场中。虽然许多心理学家认为这个理论可以理解，但我不这么认为。其实有一种更简单的方式来解释为什么我们会直接感知到事物的价值。这是因为物体对观察者的潜在用途（affordances）在刺激信息中已经被明确。它们看起来是直接被感知到的，因为它们确实是直接被感知到的。

格式塔心理学家反对的传统感知理论认为，除了感觉之外，没有任何体验是直接的，所有其他类型的体验都需要通过感觉来中介。纯粹的感觉必须被赋予意义。因此，有意义的感知的表面直接性对传统理论来说是一个难题，而格式塔心理学家强调这一点是正确的。他们开始动摇基于感觉的理论。但他们对为什么水果会「告诉」我们「吃我」和女人会「告诉」我们「爱我」的解释却牵强附会。格式塔心理学家反对传统感知理论，但他们从未能超越这些理论。

### 8.5 The Optical Information for Perceiving Affordances

The theory of affordances is a radical departure from existing theories of value and meaning. It begins with a new definition of what value and meaning are. The perceiving of an affordance is not a process of perceiving a value-free physical object to which meaning is somehow added in a way that no one has been able to agree upon; it is a process of perceiving a value-rich ecological object. Any substance, any surface, any layout has some affordance for benefit or injury to someone. Physics may be value-free, but ecology is not.

The central question for the theory of affordances is not whether they exist and are real but whether information is available in ambient light for perceiving them. The skeptic may now be convinced that there is information in light for some properties of a surface but not for such a property as being good to eat. The taste of a thing, he will say, is not specified in light; you can see its form and color and texture but not its palatability; you have to taste it for that. The skeptic understands the stimulus variables that specify the dimensions of visual sensation; he knows from psychophysics that brightness corresponds to intensity and color to wavelength of light. He may concede the invariants of structured stimulation that specify surfaces and how they are laid out and what they are made of. But he may boggle at invariant combinations of invariants that specify the affordances of the environment for an observer. The skeptic familiar with the experimental control of stimulus variables has enough trouble understanding the invariant variables I have been proposing without being asked to accept invariants of invariants.

Nevertheless, a unique combination of invariants, a compound invariant, is just another invariant. It is a unit, and the components do not have to be combined or associated. Only if percepts were combinations of sensations would they have to be associated. Even in the classical terminology, it could be argued that when a number of stimuli are completely covariant, when they always go together, they constitute a single "stimulus." If the visual system is capable of extracting invariants from a changing optic array, there is no reason why it should not extract invariants that seem to us highly complex.

The trouble with the assumption that high-order optical invariants specify high-order affordances is that experimenters, accustomed to working in the laboratory with low-order stimulus variables, cannot think of a way to measure them. How can they hope to isolate and control an invariant of optical struc- ture so as to apply it to an observer if they cannot quantify it? The answer comes in two parts, I think. First, they should not hope to apply an invariant to an observer, only to make it available, for it is not a stimulus. And, second, they do not have to quantify an invariant, to apply numbers to it, but only to give it an exact mathematical description so that other experimenters can make it available to their observers. The virtue of the psychophysical experiment is simply that it is disciplined, not that it relates the psychical to the physical by a metric formula.

An affordance, as I said, points two ways, to the environment and to the observer. So does the information to specify an affordance. But this does not in the least imply separate realms of consciousness and matter, a psychophysical dualism. It says only that the information to specify the utilities of the environment is accompanied by information to specify the observer himself, his body, legs, hands, and mouth. This is only to reemphasize that exteroception is accom- panied by proprioception-that to perceive the world is to coperceive oneself. This is wholly inconsistent with dualism in any form, either mind-matter dualism or mind-body dualism. The awareness of the world and of one's complementary relations to the world are not separable.

The child begins, no doubt, by perceiving the affordances of things for her, for her own personal behavior. She walks and sits and grasps relative to her own legs and body and hands. But she must learn to perceive the affordances of things for other observers as well as for herself. An affordance is often valid for all the animals of a species, as when it is part of a niche. I have described the invariants that enable a child to perceive the same solid shape at different points of observation and that likewise enable two or more children to perceive the same shape at different points of observation. These are the invariants that enable two children to perceive the common affordance of the solid shape despite the different perspectives, the affordance of a toy, for example. Only when each child perceives the values of things for others as well as for herself does she begin to be socialized.

感知可供性的光学信息

可供性理论（theory of affordances）是对现有价值和意义理论的重大突破。它从重新定义价值和意义出发。感知可供性，不是通过感知一个没有价值的物理对象，再以某种方式添加意义；而是直接感知一个充满价值的生态对象。任何物质、表面或布局都对某个人具有某种有益或有害的可供性。物理学可能是中立的，但生态学不是。

可供性理论的核心问题不是它们是否存在，而是环境光中是否有信息可以用来感知它们。怀疑论者可能承认光中有一些关于表面属性的信息，但不会认为光中包含诸如「可食性」这样的信息。他会说，味道不能通过光来感知；你可以看到物体的形状、颜色和质地，但不能知道它是否美味，必须品尝才能确定。怀疑论者理解那些指定视觉感知维度的刺激变量；他知道心理物理学中亮度对应于光的强度，颜色对应于光的波长。他可能会承认那些指定表面及其布局和构成的不变性。但是，当涉及到指定环境可供性的不变性组合时，他可能会犹豫不决。熟悉实验控制的怀疑论者已经很难理解我提出的不变变量了，更不用说接受这些不变性的组合了。

尽管如此，所谓的复合不变量，其实也只是另一种不变量。它是一个整体，不需要将其组成部分特别组合或关联。只有当感知是多种感觉的组合时，才需要进行关联。即使按照经典的说法，当许多刺激完全协变并总是一起出现时，它们就可以被视为一个「刺激」。如果视觉系统能够从不断变化的光学环境中提取不变量，那么它也能提取那些看起来非常复杂的不变量。

假设高级光学不变量可以指示高级可供性，这一假设的问题在于，习惯于在实验室中处理低级刺激变量的实验者，无法找到方法来测量这些高级不变量。如果他们无法量化这些不变量，又如何能够隔离和控制这些光学结构的不变量并将其应用于观察者呢？我认为可以从两个方面来回答。首先，他们不应该试图将不变量直接应用于观察者，而应该只是使其可用，因为不变量并不是刺激。其次，他们不必量化不变量，只需对其进行精确的数学描述，这样其他实验者就可以使其对观察者可用。心理物理实验的优点在于其严谨性，而不是通过度量公式将心理现象和物理现象联系起来。

可供性（affordance）指的既是环境，也涵盖了观察者。用于描述可供性的信息同样如此。但这并不意味着存在意识和物质的分离，即心理物理二元论。这仅仅说明，用于描述环境实用性的信息同时也包含了观察者自身的信息，比如他的身体、腿、手和嘴。这强调了外部感知（exteroception）和内部感知（proprioception）是同步进行的 —— 感知世界的同时也在感知自己。这与任何形式的二元论完全不符，无论是心-物二元论还是心-身二元论。对世界的认知和对与世界关系的认知是不可分割的。

孩子一开始肯定是通过感知物体对她自身行为的影响来认识事物的。她会根据自己的腿、身体和手来走路、坐下和抓握。但她还需要学习如何感知物体对其他观察者的影响，而不仅仅是对她自己的。一个可供性通常对一个物种的所有动物都有效，比如作为生态位的一部分。我描述了那些让孩子在不同观察点感知到相同固体形状的不变因素，这同样让两个或更多的孩子在不同观察点感知到相同的形状。这些不变因素帮助两个孩子在不同视角下感知到同一个玩具的可供性。只有当每个孩子不仅感知到事物对自己，还感知到对他人的价值时，她才开始社会化。

### 8.6 Misinformation for Affordances

If there is information in the ambient light for the affordances of things, can there also be misinformation? According to the thoery being developed, if information is picked up perception results; if misinformation is picked up misperception results.

The brink of a cliff affords falling off; it is in fact dangerous and it looks dangerous to us. It seems to look dangerous to many other terrestrial animals besides ourselves, including infant animals. Experimental studies have been made of this fact. If a sturdy sheet of plate glass is extended out over the edge it no longer affords falling and in fact is not dangerous, but it may still look dangerous. The optical information to specify depth-downward-at-an-edge is still present in the ambient light; for this reason the device was called a visual cliffby E. J. Gibson and R. D. Walk (1960). Haptic information was available to specify an adequate surface of support, but this was contradictory to the optical information. When human infants at the crawling stage of locomotion were tested with this apparatus, many of them would pat the glass with their hands but would not venture out on the surface. The babies misperceived the afford- ance of a transparent surface for support, and this result is not surprising.

Similarly, an adult can misperceive the affordance of a sheet of glass by mistaking a closed glass door for an open doorway and attempting to walk through it. He then crashes into the barrier and is injured. The affordance of collision was not specified by the outflow of optical texture in the array, or it was insufficiently specified. He mistook glass for air. The occluding edges of the doorway were specified and the empty visual solid angle opened up symmetrically in the normal manner as he approached, so his behavior was properly controlled, but the imminence of collision was not noticed. A little dirt on the surface, or highlights, would have saved him.

These two cases are instructive. In the first a surface of support was mistaken for air because the optic array specified air. In the second case a barrier was mistaken for air for the same reason. Air downward affords falling and is dangerous. Air forward affords passage and is safe. The mistaken perceptions led to inappropriate actions.

Errors in the perception of the surface of support are serious for a terrestrial animal. If quicksand is mistaken for sand, the perceiver is in deep trouble. If a covered pitfall is taken for solid ground, the animal is trapped. A danger is sometimes hidden-the shark under the calm water and the electric shock in the radio cabinet. In the natural environment, poison ivy is frequently mistaken for ivy. In the artificial environment, acid can be mistaken for water.

可供性的信息误导

如果环境光中包含物体可供性的信息，那么是否也会包含误导信息？根据正在发展的理论，如果获取到正确信息就会产生正确的感知；如果获取到误导信息就会产生错误的感知。

悬崖边缘会让人掉下去，这不仅实际上很危险，而且看起来也很危险。不仅仅是我们，许多陆地动物，包括幼年动物，也会觉得悬崖边缘很危险。对此，科学家们进行了实验研究。如果在悬崖边缘放置一块坚固的玻璃板，虽然实际已经没有危险，但它看起来仍然会让人觉得很危险。周围的光线仍然提供了边缘向下的深度信息；因此，这个装置被 E. J. Gibson 和 R. D. Walk （1960）称为「视觉悬崖」。触觉信息可以让人感觉到有一个足够的支撑面，但这与视觉信息相矛盾。当科学家用这个装置测试处于爬行阶段的婴儿时，很多婴儿会用手拍打玻璃，但不会爬上去。婴儿误解了透明表面的支撑能力，这个结果并不奇怪。

同样地，成年人也可能会误解玻璃的特性，把关着的玻璃门当成敞开的门，试图穿过去，结果撞到玻璃受伤。由于光学纹理的流动没有充分显示出碰撞的可能性，或者显示得不够明显，他把玻璃误认为空气。门口的遮挡边缘和空旷的视觉角度在他靠近时正常地对称展开，所以他的行为是正确的，但他没有注意到即将发生的碰撞。一点点污垢或者反光就能避免这种情况发生。

这两个案例很有启发性。第一个案例中，由于光学阵列显示的是空气，一个支撑面被误认为是空气。第二个案例中，同样的原因导致一个障碍物被误认为是空气。向下的空气意味着跌落，具有危险性；向前的空气意味着通行，具有安全性。这些错误感知导致了错误的行为。

对于陆地动物来说，错误感知支撑面是非常危险的。如果把流沙误认为是普通沙子，感知者会陷入困境。如果把覆盖的陷阱误认为是坚实的地面，动物会被困住。有些危险是隐藏的 —— 例如，平静水面下的鲨鱼和收音机柜中的电击。在自然环境中，毒常春藤常被误认为是普通常春藤；在人造环境中，酸可能被误认为是水。

THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT THEY ARE

If the affordances of a thing are perceived correctly, we say that it looks like what it is. But we must, of course, learn to see what things really are - for example, that the innocent-looking leaf is really a nettle or that the helpful-sounding politician is really a demagogue. And this can be very difficult.

看起来像它们本身的事物

如果正确感知到一个事物的可供性，我们说它看起来像它本身。但我们需要学会识别事物的真实面貌 —— 例如，看似无害的叶子可能是荨麻，表面上和善的政治家可能是个煽动者。这往往非常困难。

A wildcat may be hard to distinguish from a cat, and a thief may look like an honest person. When Koffka asserted that "each thing says what it is," he failed to mention that it may lie. More exactly, a thing may not look like what it is.

Nevertheless, however true all this may be, the basic affordances of the environment are perceivable and are usually perceivable directly, without an excessive amount of learning. The basic properties of the environment that make an affordance are specified in the structure of ambient light, and hence the affordance itself is specified in ambient light. Moreover, an invariant variable that is commensurate with the body of the observer himself is more easily picked up than one not commensurate with his body.

野猫和家猫很难区分，窃贼可能看起来像个诚实的人。Koffka 说「每件东西都在说它是什么」，但他忽略了这些东西可能会欺骗我们。更确切地说，有些事物看起来并不像它们实际是什么。

尽管如此，环境的基本可供性通常是可以直接感知的，不需要太多学习。环境中决定可供性的基本性质在环境光的结构中得到体现，因此可供性本身由环境光来指示。此外，与观察者自身身体相称的不变量比那些不相称的更容易被感知。

### Summary

The medium, substances, surfaces, objects, places, and other animals have affordances for a given animal. They offer benefit or injury, life or death. This is why they need to be perceived.

The possibilities of the environment and the way of life of the animal go together inseparably. The environment constrains what the animal can do, and the concept of a niche in ecology reflects this fact. Within limits, the human animal can alter the affordances of the environment but is still the creature of his or her situation.

There is information in stimulation for the physical properties of things, and presumably there is information for the environmental properties. The doctrine that says we must distinguish among the variables of things before we can learn their meanings is questionable. Affordances are properties taken with reference to the observer. They are neither physical nor phenomenal.

The hypothesis of information in ambient light to specify affordances is the culmination of ecological optics. The notion of invariants that are related at one extreme to the motives and needs of an observer and at the other extreme to the substances and surfaces of a world provides a new approach to psychology.

总结

媒介、物质、表面、物体、地点以及其他动物对于某种动物来说具有「可供性」(Affordances)。这些可供性可能带来好处或伤害，决定生死存亡。因此，动物需要感知这些可供性。

环境与动物的生活方式密不可分。环境限制了动物的行为，这也是生态学中「生态位」概念的体现。虽然在一定程度上，人类可以改变环境的可供性，但人类仍然受制于其所处的环境。

事物的物理属性中包含信息，环境属性中也同样蕴含信息。认为我们必须先区分事物的变量才能理解其意义的观点是值得怀疑的。可供性是基于观察者的属性，既不是纯粹的物理属性，也不是单纯的现象。

在环境光中的信息可以用来确定可供性，这一假说是生态光学的核心思想。从与观察者的动机和需求相关，到与世界的物质和表面相关的「不变性」概念，为心理学提供了一种全新的研究方法。
