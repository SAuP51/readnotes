地面事件的分类

我们关注的是「外部」事件，因此不讨论观察点的位移，因为这涉及到潜在观察者的移动，而不是表面的运动。观察点位移通常带来的遮挡变化是一种很特殊的光学现象，因为它同时具有客观和主观的参考，也就是说，表面的显露和隐藏取决于表面和观察点的位置。

我们主要关注的是地面上的事件，因此不考虑太阳在天空中的移动及其引起的阴影变化。我们感兴趣的是那些完全独立于观察者和太阳位置的事件。

那么，排除这些因素后，哪些事件可以说是发生了的呢？初步来看，它们可以分为三大类：表面布局的变化、表面颜色和纹理的变化以及表面存在的变化。布局的变化是由力引起的；颜色和纹理的变化是由物质成分的变化引起的；表面存在的变化是由物质状态的变化引起的。我们将逐一分析这些变化。

由于复杂力引起的布局变化

由于复杂的力作用而导致的布局变化，指的是环境表面形状的任何改变，包括通过移动重新定位脱离的物体。在地球上的各种事物中，有些是可以移动的，而有些则不能。我们通常所说的运动是脱离物体的平移和旋转，如下落的物体、旋转的陀螺、滚动的球和被投掷的导弹。我们通过学习力学来了解这些现象。然而，还有许多其他表面布局的变化同样重要：例如动物表面的柔性变形、水的波动和流动、橡胶和粘土的弹性和塑性变化，以及表面的破裂或断裂。尽管我们不常将这些变化称为运动，但它们依然是由力引起的机械现象。虽然这些变化没有天体在引力作用下运动的简洁优雅，但它们仍然遵循一定的规律，并且在适当的分析水平上具有某种更高层次的简洁性。

布局变化刚性物体的平移和旋转位移（下落的物体、飞行的箭）
转动（开门）
组合（滚动的球）

物体的碰撞有反弹和无反弹非刚性物体的变形无生命的（液滴、粘土块）
有生命的（动物的姿势变化）

表面变形波浪流动弹性或塑性变化表面破坏破裂、开裂解体爆炸

上面的表格虽然不完整，但已经提供了一些启示。它涉及所谓的生态力学，这与天体力学或粒子力学（包括热力学）有很大不同。木匠和建筑工人对这门物理学分支很熟悉，尽管它不在学校教授。分离物体的位移和转动可以看作是布局的变化，因为它们是地球上物体的重新排列，而不是简单的沿着笛卡尔坐标空间的三个轴进行平移和旋转。地球是这些运动的背景，其地表是这些运动的绝对参考系，因为地球本身是固定不动的。在这个分析层面上，世界是静止的。因此，当哥白尼试图说服当时的人们地球在运动时，他们的震惊是可以理解的。

在这个分析层面上，表面的变形和破坏也不是简化为物质基本粒子的运动。例如，伸展和松弛是一个独立的事件，而不是一系列事件的集合；它不能被简化为表面元素相互关联的位移。

上表中列出的事件类型可以组合出现。例如，动物运动包括相对于地面的位移和转向，这是通过动物身体的变形来实现的，比如身体部分的弯曲和伸展。碰撞可能发生在两个弹性物体之间，或者在弹性物体与地面之间，因此一个位移紧接着另一个位移，形成一系列事件。在拥有运动部件的机器中，会有一系列同时发生的事件。人类发明了许多机械运动部件，每个都有其特定的运动方式，如轮子、滚筒、曲柄和齿轮；杠杆、摇杆、钟摆和铰链；活塞、滑块、小齿轮、擒纵机构和螺丝。因此，当一台复杂的机器运行时，会出现一层层的同时发生的事件。不过需要注意的是，机器是由这些独立部件组装而成的，每个部件在当前术语中都是独立的对象。而生物体则不同，它们并不是由独立部件组装而成的，尽管它们的部分会移动，但它们构成了另一种层级结构。

** 基底 **

地球作为基底，不仅是所有物体移动的参考点，也是所有物体正立、倾斜或倒置的参考点。也就是说，地球从地平线延伸到地平线，是水平的。在生态层面上，重力是绝对的，而不是相对的。

关于图片相对于框架的正立性、图案相对于页面的正立性以及图像相对于视网膜的正立性的心理学问题并不是主要问题，而是派生问题。

需要注意的是，位移、转动、变形，甚至波动和水流，都可以在不破坏表面连续性的情况下发生。而当连续性失效时，破裂就会发生，这是一种非常重要的生态事件。比如，地震中裂开的地面无法行走，破裂的屋顶无法提供庇护。破碎的罐子无法再装水，动物的皮肤破裂则会造成伤害。最大程度的破坏可以被称为解体。我们通常说的表面「分崩离析」，实际上是指完全的连续性失效。在这种情况下，事件从布局的变化转变为存在的变化；因为物质的状态发生了改变，表面也随之消失。

最后，我们注意到这些事件中有一个非常有趣的现象：有些事件是可逆的，而有些则不是。位移、转动以及运动都可以前后进行。正如我之前强调的那样，运动包含了前进和后退，因此隐藏的表面可以变得显露，而显露的表面也可以变得隐藏。类似地，光照的表面会变成阴影，而阴影的表面会变得光照。在物理力学中，任何刚体的运动在相反方向上都有对应的等效运动。这种可逆性适用于某些非刚性变形，尽管不是所有的非刚性变形都适用，但它不适用于表面破裂。更具体地说，从完整到破裂的变化并不是从破裂到完整的逆过程；破裂的过程并不是修复的反向过程。在极端情况下，当一个表面解体时，这个过程并不能通过聚集和连接部分来恢复成一个完整的表面。通过制作一个表面破裂或织物撕裂的电影序列，然后比较正放和倒放的影片，可以观察到这两个过程的区别（Gibson 和 Kaushall, 1973）。

成分变化引起的颜色和纹理变化

理论上，一个表面可以在不改变形状的情况下改变颜色，也可以在不改变颜色的情况下改变形状。人们通常认为这些是物体的独立「性质」，并且对「次要」性质和「主要」性质之间的差异进行了大量研究。实际上，颜色和形状的性质过于简化，因为纹理与颜色融合，而在小尺度上，纹理也是一种形状。本文将一起讨论颜色和纹理，因为它们是物质组成的特定属性。当物质通过化学反应发生变化时，表面也会随之改变。这种变化不仅会影响无色和有色，还会改变表面的纹理，因为细微结构可能会从晶态变为非晶态。动物需要在接触物质表面之前，提前感知物质的可供性（affordance），即它们的化学特性或用途，正如我之前提到的（Gibson, 1966b, 第 8 章)，并将在本书中再次讨论。因此，自然界中化学变化如变绿、成熟、开花和褪色，都会引起可供性的变化。这些都是重要的生态事件，就像动物的生理反应导致的羽毛、皮毛或皮肤的变化一样。

颜色和纹理的变化植物表面
- 变绿（叶绿素增加）
- 褪色（叶绿素减少）
- 成熟（糖分增加）
- 开花（出现花蜜）

动物表面
- 皮肤着色（性接受度，如在狒狒中）
- 羽毛变化（成熟）
- 皮毛变化（冬季来临）

陆地表面
- 岩石风化（氧化）
- 木材变黑（火灾）
- 铁变红（生锈）

上述表格展示了一些显著的表面变化示例，这些变化并不涉及布局或形状的显著改变。通常，这些变化是相关联的。例如，冬季来临时，树叶不仅会枯萎和掉落，还会变色。多种环境事件结合在一起，提供了丰富的信息保障。

从生态学角度看，火灾是一种复杂的现象，包括火焰的运动和变形、发光表面的波动、不透明表面的变红和变黑、滚滚浓烟，最终固体表面的消失。火灾不仅能被视觉感知，还能通过皮肤、耳朵和鼻子感知。

生态层面的化学事件涉及颜色和纹理的变化，而在分子和原子层面则没有颜色。这是色觉研究中的一个古老难题。光学阵列中没有关于辐射原子的任何信息，但可以提供物质成分的相关信息。

试管中的化学反应通常是可逆的，这可以用双向箭头的化学方程式来表示。然而，生态层面的化学变化在时间上是不可逆的。例如，成熟、生锈和燃烧都不会逆向发生。虽然生态变化中存在平衡循环，例如二氧化碳循环，但这些变化在时间上是前进的，不是可逆的。

物质状态变化引起的表面增减

表面是物质与介质之间的界面。无论多么复杂的物质，都可以归类为固体、粘性、粘弹性、液体和颗粒状。气体虽然是物质的一种形态，但并不被认为是「物质」。当物质转变为气态时，它成为介质的一部分，其表面就不复存在。它并没有消失，只是失去了物质的特性，因此不再反射光，在任何观察点都不会被检测到。这不仅仅是消失，而是彻底不存在了（第 5 章）。下表左栏列出了一些表面消失或被破坏的方式。

当然，表面也可以从气态形成，或从液态变为固态，右栏中列出了这些事件的示例。

表面存在的变化液体转变为气体（蒸发、沸腾）
气体转变为液体（冷凝、降雨）
固体转变为气体（升华）
气体转变为固体？
云转变为气体（消散）
气体转变为云（形成）
固体转变为液体（熔化）
液体转变为固体（冻结）
固体溶解（溶解）
溶液转变为固体（结晶、沉淀）

分解聚集生物衰变生物生长破坏建设当冰或雪融化时，表面发生了如此彻底的变化，以至于可以认为它被破坏了；而当一滩水蒸发时，表面也肯定被破坏了。当云的反射表面消散时，它被完全消灭了，尽管它最初是半透明的，仅由一团液滴组成。当表面解体或有机物死亡时，物质被分散，表面消失。生态表面的破坏是显而易见的，但生态表面的创造却不容易被察觉，除了动物和植物的缓慢生长外。

表面理论和原子理论

在第 1 章中提到，在物理学中，表面出现和消失这一事实很少被认识到。相反，原子理论被强调。自巴门尼德和德谟克利特开始，这一理论主张，任何事物都不会被创造或消灭；原子本身是不变的，只是重新排列。亚里士多德对此持不同意见。他认为，世界上的事物确实有生成和消逝。在生态层面上，亚里士多德是对的。我们感知世界的层面正是表面层面，而不是原子层面（Randall, 1960)。

在上表中，我试图展示这些过程对立的最佳情况，但它们显然在时间上是不可逆的。在某种程度上，蒸发和凝结是相反的，但水面不是通过反向过程创造的。在这些事件对中，没有一个是简单的反向过程。如果将一个事件的影片倒放，它不会表现出另一个事件的过程（Gibson and Kaushall, 1973)。

总结：我们应该把什么当作事件？

上述分类仅是初步的研究。生态事件是多样且难以形式化的。但当我们试图将其简化为基本的物理事件时，它们变得复杂无比，而物理的复杂性使我们无法理解生态的简单性。因为在更高层次上存在规律性，这些规律无法被简单的力学和物理学方程所涵盖。例如，动物的运动是有规律的，但这些规律无法从传统力学定律中推导出来，可能永远无法推导出来。对力学过于严格的遵循阻碍了对地面事件的研究。

事件作为主要现实

首先，生态事件的流动与物理学中假设的时间流逝是不同的。事件的流动是多样的，被区分成不同的部分，而时间的流逝被认为是均匀且线性的。Isaac Newton 曾断言，「绝对的、真实的和数学的时间，其本质上是均匀流动的，与任何外部事物无关。」但这其实是一个便捷的神话。它假定事件发生在「时间」中，且时间是空的，除非被「填满」。这种思维方式是本末倒置的。我们应该把事件看作是基本的现实，而时间则是从这些事件中抽象出来的概念 —— 主要是从像钟表滴答声这样有规律重复的事件中得来的。事件是可以被感知的，但时间则不是（Gibson，1975）。

空间的情况与时间相同。物体并没有填满空间，因为一开始就没有所谓的空空间。环境中持久的表面才提供了现实的框架。这个世界从来都不是一片虚无。至于媒介，即运动和移动可以发生的区域，光可以反射和表面可以被照亮的地方，这或许可以称为房间，但它不是空间。表面及其布局是可以被感知的，但空间则不是，正如我长期以来一直主张的那样（Gibson，1950）。

即使不如我上面所说的那么极端，也有人可能会说，时间由填满它的事件构成，空间由填满它的物体构成。但我认为，这种说法依然延续了错误的观念。填充的比喻是错误的。时间和空间不是需要被填满的空容器；相反，它们只是事件和表面的幻影。

时间并不是空间的另一维度，即所谓的第四维度。现代物理学为了数学上的方便而这样假定。实际上，时间维度背后的本质是事件的顺序，而空间维度背后的本质是物体或表面部分的邻近顺序。顺序和邻近顺序是不可比拟的，它们甚至没有可比性。因为事件的顺序不能被改变，而物体部分的顺序是可以改变的。比如，你可以重新排列物体的部分，但不能重新排列事件的顺序，就像你可以重新布置房间里的家具，但不能重新改变发生在房间里的事情。

重复和不重复在生态事件的流动中，总是有一定程度的重复和不重复。例如，时钟擒纵机构的步进动作和指针的旋转是纯粹的重复。而云的形成和河流中沙洲的移动则是新颖的、不重复的现象。每一次新的日出都像前一次一样，但又不完全一样，每一天也是如此。同样，一个生物体即使有其节奏，也永远不会完全相同。这种关于事件的规律与变化背后的不变公式是一致的。

可逆和不可逆事件

有些生态事件是可以逆转的，而有些则是不可逆的。位置的变化可以回到原点，但状态的变化却无法逆转。更具体地说，构成一个长事件的一系列短事件，其顺序从头到尾是不能颠倒的，否则会违反某些生态物理学的定律。破坏和修复并不是对等的，当它们看起来像是对等时，就显得有些神奇了。这与受形式物理定律支配的事件不同，除了热力学外，这些事件既可以向前也可以向后。这些方程中的时间变量是没有方向的。这表明，时间的不可逆性实际上是某些生态事件的不可逆性，而不是所有事件的不可逆性。仅用熵的增加来定义时间的方向是不正确的。

事件的嵌套

生态事件的流动由嵌套在一起的自然单元组成 —— 情节中还有情节，分级情节和总情节。因此，选择一个单一情节取决于适当的开始和结束，而不是测量单位。在确定情节单元之前，无法计算序列中的情节数量。情节就像表面一样，具有不同层次的结构。年和天是自然的时间单位；而小时、分钟和秒则是人为的单位。动物行为中有很多嵌套层次结构的例子，最明显的是在人类的言语、音乐和戏剧等活动中。如果我们能理解这些嵌套的序列，可能就能理解在某些情况下，事件的结果在一开始就已经隐含其中 —— 即在开始时就能预见结束。

事件的可供性最后，需要强调的是，一些自然事件会要求或引导适当的行为。有些事件对动物有可供性（affordance)，就像地方、物体和其他动物一样，其他事件则会改变地方、物体或其他动物的可供性。火在寒冷的夜晚提供温暖，但也会带来被烧伤的风险。一个接近的物体可能带来接触但不碰撞，或者碰撞的结果；一个被抛出的苹果和一个导弹是完全不同的情况。对于我们的早期祖先，一个接近的兔子意味着食物，而一个接近的老虎则意味着危险。这些事件不是刺激，称其为刺激是错误的。问题是：通过光线能提供哪些信息来帮助我们感知这些事件？

感知事件的光学信息

我们现在可以问，当环境中发生事件时，周围光学阵列中会发生什么。什么指定了事件的发生？一般来说，答案应是阵列的不变结构中出现了扰动。据推测，不同类型的事件会引起不同类型的扰动。

再次提醒自己，世界上的事件不应与光中相应的信息混淆。就像阵列中没有物质对象，只有指定对象的不变量一样，阵列中也没有物质事件，只有指定事件的信息。世界上的任何对象都不会在周围光中被字面复制或模拟。而对于世界上发生的事情，它不可能在光中被复制。我们应该意识到这一点，但仍然有一种强烈的诱惑认为，世界中物体的运动被光中元素的运动复制，或者至少是二维中的运动被复制，尽管不是深度中的运动。但我将尝试表明这种假设是完全错误的，因为这两种「运动」—— 物理和光学，毫无共同之处，甚至可能不应该使用相同的术语。光中的扰动的开始和结束对应于世界中事件的开始和结束，但这就是它们对应的全部。

机械事件

关于机械运动事件，首先考虑刚体平移的情况，此时物体与观察点的距离保持不变。当物体相对于环境发生位移时，你可能会认为视固角只是相对于环境光球发生位移。视觉形式不会改变，‘图形'只是移动在‘背景'上。虽然听起来合理，但这是错误的。物体的视固角只是固角阵列中的一个，这个阵列在数学上是密集的。给定的视角补丁不能像物体在空间中那样移动，因为它没有空间移动。发生的只是结构的扰动。视固角的一边发生渐进的删除，而相对的一边发生渐进的增加。前者对应于物体的前缘，后者对应于物体的后缘。或者，如果平移物体的背景没有纹理，例如在天空中移动的物体，则物体边缘与最近边缘之间的间隙构成了减少和增加的视角补丁。这种减少和增加类似于纹理单元的删除和增加。我的意思是，即使在天空中的运动也是天空形式的变化，即使在窗口中的位移也是结构的变化，而不仅仅是运动。

上述刚性平移的情况是特殊的；物体既不靠近也不远离观察点，其轮廓也没有变化。通常情况下，物体的轮廓会被放大或缩小。放大意味着轮廓外的光学结构逐渐消失，而缩小则相反，意味着逐渐增加。这表示，当物体靠近观察点时，它会遮挡越来越多的环境，而当它远离时，遮挡的环境会越来越少。阵列中形状的放大表示某物体在靠近，而缩小表示某物体在远离。当环境阵列的视觉立体角接近半球时，即达到 180° 的宽度，这是立体角的极限，表明物体与观察点接触。这是自然透视的一般规律。动物通过眼睛获取这些信息是一个非常有趣的心理学问题。W. Schiff（1965）研究了当物体「逼近」引发即将接触或碰撞时动物的行为。当观察者靠近一个物体或孔洞时，情况有所不同，这将在第 12 章中描述。

这些光学干扰显然不是物体运动的直接复制，这一点大家都会同意。那么物体在其轴上的纯旋转（牛顿旋转）又如何呢？在这种情况下，背景的变化可能很小甚至没有。如果物体是一个球体、圆盘或车轮，并且沿观察点视线的轴旋转，你可能会认为数组中圆形的旋转就是世界中圆形物体的旋转的复制。但是，即使在这种特殊情况下，这也是一种误解。实际上，光学上发生的是，当物体在背景前旋转时，轮廓处的纹理会发生剪切或滑动，尽管数组中没有任何东西被添加或删除。这种现象打破了数组的连续性。换句话说，纹理单元的对齐，例如圆的半径，在轮廓处发生了位移。除了这种特殊情况，所有其他物体的旋转，以及所有非圆形物体的旋转，都会导致光学纹理的逐渐损失和增加，这种变化是由于在一个边界处的缩短和在另一个边界处的反向缩短引起的；也就是说，物体的面会进入和退出视野。简而言之，物体通常不能旋转而不引起遮挡的变化。

当世界中的一个表面发生变形时，阵列中会有什么变化？在这种情况下，假设光学纹理的变形是实质纹理变形的副本是合理的，因为光学单元是实质单元的投影，通过自然透视，并且与它们一一对应。似乎河流中水表面的不均匀流动 —— 表面的气泡和斑点 —— 在阵列中具有相应的光学纹理流动。但这不适用于表面的涟漪或波浪，因为涟漪的运动方式与纹理表面的运动方式不同。光影的波动与表面不对应。当然，如果波浪的波峰很高，它们会开始隐藏波谷，遮挡边缘会破坏投影对应关系。

当一个表面破裂或断裂时，阵列中会发生什么变化？表面纹理的数学连续性消失，光学纹理的数学连续性也随之消失。随着表面裂缝变成间隙，先前不存在的遮挡边缘出现了。随着间隙扩大，新的表面显现出来。不同的光学纹理填充了间隙并被添加到阵列中。这种在间隙中出现的新结构可能是关键信息。需要精确的描述，但这可能很困难。数学家似乎未能成功解决不连续性问题。

关于各种机械事件，认为「光学运动是三维物理运动在二维中的投影」（Gibson，1957，p. 289）是一个严重的错误。我曾在一篇关于「光学运动和变换」的论文中也提到过这一点。尽管投影几何中的点对点对应概念既简单又强大，但它不适用于事件的光学，就像它不适用于不透明表面的光学一样，因为它忽略了遮挡问题。这一错误深深植根于我们对空旷空间，特别是所谓空间第三维度的概念中。无论我们对空间的感知是什么，它并不仅仅是对深度维度的感知。

化学事件当多彩表面的组成发生变化时，光学阵列中会发生什么变化？比如绿色植物开花，绿色水果成熟；岩石风化，木材变黑。这些组成的变化几乎总是通过反射率的变化来表现，无论是非选择性还是选择性，无论是无色还是有色的。在广义上，一个物质必然是一种着色剂，即便它不是颜料。

正如我所指出的，只要物质是化学惰性的，表面的反射率就会保持不变，这种稳定性是环境光学阵列中不变结构的来源。但当物质不是惰性时，它们的反射率就不会保持不变，特别是生物体的表面是化学活跃的。植物和动物会随着季节变化改变它们的颜色和纹理。

但是，不幸的是，当环境中的一个表面改变颜色时，我们并不清楚视光阵列中会发生什么变化。可以肯定的是，这会对基础的不变结构产生「扰动」，但这种描述过于模糊。问题在于，我们不知道视光阵列中的哪个不变量能确定世界中恒定的表面颜色，更不用说变化的表面颜色了。我们也不清楚如何定义组成。我们不知道如何将黑色和白色与阴影和光照区分开来。我认为移动的光源是这个问题的关键，但我还没有发展出具体的理论。

相比之下，当环境中的一个表面改变纹理时，说明视光阵列中的变化就容易多了。平坦的、集合的表面的颜料纹理会被投射到视光阵列中，尽管存在各种透视变换，颜料纹理的质量、密度和规则性在光学纹理中都能被识别出来。这些纹理的「形式」在光照方向和光照量变化时也保持不变。也许物质的组成就是通过这种方式被识别出来的，因为这对动物来说是至关重要的，所以我们认为表面的纯粹抽象反射率并没有那么重要。

表面破坏与创造

最后，我们探讨光学阵列中关于由于物质状态变化而导致的表面出现和消失的信息。读者可能还记得，当环境光在某一区域是结构化的，而在相邻区域是非结构化的时，前者对应一个表面，后者对应一个空隙。例如，地平线下方的有纹理区域表示坚实的大地，而地平线以上的均匀区域表示空旷的天空。同样，天空中的不均匀区域表示存在表面，即使这些表面只是云，而云之间的均匀区域表示没有表面。森林中的树冠形成了头顶上的纹理，而树冠中的孔洞则是无纹理的，鸟类会飞入这些孔洞。只要光学阵列中的任何视觉固体角保持非结构化，它就表示一个孔洞；即使放大到半球极限，鸟类也不会撞上任何表面，而是会穿过孔洞飞行。

在环境阵列的上半球中，云层表面会消散，我们称之为「消失」。光学纹理被替换成了没有纹理的状态。同样，云层表面也会在天空中形成，我们称之为「物质化」。无纹理状态则被纹理所替代。在阵列的下半球，光学过渡更为复杂，因为总是有一个背景纹理。随着液体表面的蒸发、固体表面的升华或溶解，光学纹理被其背后的任何物体的纹理所取代。当一个结构消失时，另一个结构取而代之。有时物体在过渡过程中会变得透明，这意味着一个表面会显示在另一个表面后面。这种现象在电影技术中称为「溶解」，即一个画面逐渐消失，而另一个画面在同一位置逐渐出现。这就是所谓的「淡出」和「淡入」，两者同时发生。

** 灵魂的理论 **

这些演员融化成空气，成稀薄的空气：
就像这个幻觉的无基之物，
云顶塔楼，华丽的宫殿，
庄严的寺庙，整个地球本身是的，所有这些继承者，都将消失就像这个无实体的盛宴褪去，
不留痕迹。

莎士比亚，《暴风雨》

描述消散、蒸发、升华、溶解、瓦解和腐烂的光学过渡，似乎是用一种纹理替代另一种纹理的复杂变体。关于它们的系统研究从未进行过。但孩子们会注意到这些现象，被其吸引，并仔细观察这些纹理替代发生的区域。他们可能还学会了区分这些替代，并理解它们的意义。

通过逐步替换和在轮廓一侧逐步删除的方式，光学纹理的丧失在光学阵列中的差异已被一部电影初步展示（Gibson, 1968a)。逐步替换会使一个表面消失，而逐步删除则会使一个表面在遮挡边缘消失，如上一节所述。事实上，人们在观看这部电影时确实能看到这些截然不同的现象。

光学结构的扰动类型我曾说过，当世界上发生某些事情时，光学阵列中最普遍的变化是其结构发生扰动。由于没有现成的术语来描述光学变化（或物理变化)，我们需要探索最合适的表达。我曾提到光学变换和排列，也讨论了光影变化中的波动，还提到了光学过渡。我认为不应该用「运动」来描述阵列中的变化，「扰动」是最佳的通用术语。以下是一些已描述的扰动类型：

1. 在轮廓一侧逐步删除和增加单位（物体相对于背景的位移)

2. 缝隙的逐步减少和增加（物体相对于天空的位移)

3. 轮廓处光学纹理的剪切或滑移（盘旋转)

4. 透视变换通过缩短及其相反（物体表面的转动)

5. 极限放大和缩小（物体的接近和远离)

6. 变形（流体、粘性和弹性事件)

7. 新结构的出现（破裂)

8. 纹理的消失（在天空中消散)

9. 新纹理替代旧纹理（在地面上消散)

10.「颜色结构」的变化（化学事件)

这些现象真是奇怪！它们既难以描述，也难以理解。然而，这些光学现象或者类似的情况在光的阵列中经常发生，即使没有人直接察觉到，它们也携带了有关环境事件的信息。在电影屏幕上不断变化的光阵列中，这些现象一定是传递意义的「运动」。它们肯定是有规律的，值得从一个新的角度进行研究，而不受传统光刺激理论的偏见影响。

这些结构的变化可以用数学方法处理吗？显然不能用同一种数学方法处理所有情况，因为有些现象不符合集合论的假设。上述一些变化没有保持单位随时间的一对一映射，因为阵列在时间推移中会增加或减少单位。遮挡过程中纹理的增加或删除就是一个例子。纹理的缩短或压缩仅在达到极限前保持一对一映射，之后纹理就会消失。表面破裂带来的新纹理、表面消散导致的纹理消失以及新旧纹理的替换，都是一对一映射或投影对应失败的其他例子。在这些情况下，环境阵列中的每个单位不会在不同时间点保持对应关系。光学阵列中单位的「闪烁」现象也是一个例子，与光影变化相关的波动同样如此。

另一方面，有些光学干扰确实能在时间上保持单位的对应关系，比如透视变换、形变或拓扑变换，甚至是轮廓处光学纹理的剪切或滑动。在局部置换点纹理的情况下，或者像布朗运动那样的随机位移，单位仍然保持不变，没有增减。变换中的不变性，即单位之间的比例和关系，在上述首要干扰中最为明显，而在后面的置换中最少，但在所有情况下都能找到不变性。相较于形式的干扰，连接性或相邻顺序的混乱影响更大。完全打乱单位的相邻顺序更为严重。不过，可能存在一个数学理论可以解释这些持久性结构干扰的变换。我们缺少的是在单位不持久的干扰下保持的不变性理论。

嵌套结构的光学放大如果一个表面由嵌套在更大单位中的小单位组成，那么它的光学阵列就是由嵌套在更大视角中的小视角组成。当观察点靠近表面时，所有视角都会放大到一个极限角度（180°），即使是那些在远处看不见的小单位也会变得清晰。表面越近，其内部的小单位就越清晰。这种放大过程有终点吗？

视网膜中的这些扰动与它们所代表的环境事件并不相同。表面上的相似性是误导性的。即使将光学扰动简化为斑点的移动，它们依然不像空间中物体或粒子的运动。光学斑点没有质量和惯性，无法碰撞。而且，事实上，这些斑点通常并不是独立存在的，而是嵌套在一起的形式，因此它们根本无法移动。这就是为什么我认为所谓的光学运动与物理运动有很大区别，甚至不应该称之为运动。

那么，光学扰动在什么方面与环境事件相对应呢？它们在时间顺序上是对应的。视网膜数组中扰动的开始和结束与环境事件的开始和结束是同步的，没有延迟。如果事件同时发生，扰动也是同步的。如果一个事件由多个子事件组成，那么扰动也会包含多个子扰动，就像一个球在一系列弹跳中滚下楼梯一样。如果一个事件是逐渐发生的，扰动也是逐渐的（比如一个气球被吹起）；如果事件是突然发生的，扰动也是突然的（比如气球爆炸）。如果事件是单一的（比如一个球滚过屏幕后又滚出来），扰动也是单一的 —— 在遮挡的边缘处先消失后出现。至少，这是我的建议。

如果环境中发生一系列重复的事件，那么周围的光学阵列也会出现相应的重复扰动。当这些事件是机械性的，比如物体碰撞或表面破裂时，这些光学扰动通常会伴随着声音。光学扰动和声学扰动是同时发生的，并且它们的信息流顺序是固定的。与一系列物体的相邻顺序不同，一系列事件的发生顺序是不可更改的。一天中的某些事件，比如位移，可以逆向发生，但它们的发生顺序是不可改变的。这就是为什么我们说「时间」有一个「箭头」，也是为什么「时间旅行」是一个神话。

事件的因果关系一种特殊的机械事件涉及两个独立的物体和两个连续的位移，这就是碰撞，其中第一个位移导致了第二个位移。这是一个包含两个子事件的上级事件。一个弹性物体被另一个弹性物体撞击，可能是我们所能看到的最明显的因果序列的例子。

对于无生命的物体，碰撞可能导致破裂、弯曲、碎裂、变形等现象，并伴随位移。对于有生命的物体，碰撞可能导致受伤和各种复杂的反应。自从 Hume 以来，哲学家和心理学家一直在争论这种因果关系是否可以被感知。Hume 认为，虽然我们可以依次感知到两个物体的运动，但不能看到一个运动导致另一个运动。他认为我们只能感知到事件的继起，而不能感知到因果关系。

A. Michotte（1963）试图反驳 Hume 的观点。在第 10 章中，我们将探讨他的证据。人们真的能够感知到一个动态事件吗？是否有信息可以明确指示这种因果关系？最近在 Uppsala 的实验表明确实如此（Runeson, 1977）。

总结

尝试对生态事件进行了初步分类。只有当我们确定什么是事件时，才能描述由此引起的光学阵列变化。而且只有这样，我们才能开始研究事件的感知。认为世界中的运动会引起光学阵列运动的假设是完全错误的，尽管这种观点常常被默认。

我们将事件大致分为三类：表面布局的变化、表面颜色或纹理的变化，以及表面存在性的变化。第一类包括物体的平移和旋转、碰撞、变形和破坏。第二类包括植物和动物表面发生的各种无名但重要的变化。第三类则包括蒸发、消散、熔化、溶解和腐烂等转变。虽然其中一些事件是可逆的，但许多却不是。

我们得出的结论是，生态事件嵌套在更长的事件中，有时是重复的，有时是新的，具有意义，并且不像牛顿所说的「绝对数学时间」那样均匀流动。

## 09. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception

Persisting Layout

Direct perception is what one gets from seeing Niagara Falls, say, as distin- guished from seeing a picture of it. The latter kind of perception is mediated. So when I assert that perception of the environment is direct, I mean that it is not mediated by retinal pictures, neural pictures, or mental pictures. Direct perception is the activity of getting information from the ambient array of light. I call this a process of information pickup that involves the exploratory activity of looking around, getting around, and looking at things. This is quite different from the supposed activity of getting information from the inputs of the optic nerves, whatever they may prove to be.

The evidence for direct visual perception has accumulated slowly, over many years. The very idea had to be developed, the results of old experiments had to be reinterpreted, and new experiments had to be carried out. The next two chapters are devoted to the experimental evidence.

The experiments will be considered under three main headings: first, the direct perception of surface layout; second, the direct perception of changing surface layout; and third, the direct perception of the movements of the self. This chapter is devoted to the direct perception of surface layout.

Evidence for the Direct Perception of Surface Layout

Some thirty years ago, during World War II, psychologists were trying to apply the theory of depth perception to the problems of aviation, especially the problem of how a flier lands an airplane. Pilots were given tests for depth perception, and there was controversy as to whether depth perception was learned or innate. The same tests are still being given, and the same disagree- ment continues. 140 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The theory of depth perception assumes that the third dimension of space is lost in the two-dimensional retinal image. Perception must begin with form perception, the flat patchwork of colors in the visual field. But there are suppos- edly cues for depth, which, if they are utilized, will add a third dimension to the flat visual field. A list of the cues for depth is given in most psychology textbooks: linear perspective, apparent size, superposition, light and shade, relative motion, aerial perspective, accommodation (the monocular cues), along with binocular disparity and convergence (the binocular cues). You might suppose that adequate tests could be made of a prospective flier's ability to use these cues and that exper- iments could be devised to find out whether or not they were learned.

The trouble was that none of the tests based on the cues for depth predicted the success or failure of a student pilot, and none of the proposals for improving depth perception by training made it any easier to learn to fly. I was deeply puzzled by this fact. The accepted theory of depth perception did not work. It did not apply to problems where one might expect it to apply. I began to suspect that the traditional list of cues for depth was inadequate. And in the end I came to believe that the whole theory of depth perception was false.

I suggested a new theory in a book on what I called the visual world (Gibson. 1950b). I considered "the possibility that there is literally no such thing as a perception of space without the perception of a continuous background surface" (p. 6). I called this a ground theory of space perception to distinguish it from the air theory that seemed to underlie the old approach. The idea was that the world consisted of a basic surface with adjoining surfaces, not of bodies in empty air. The character of the visual world was given not by objects but by the back- ground of the objects. Even the space of the airplane pilot, I said, was determ- ined by the ground and the horizon of the earth, not by the air through which he flies. The notion of space of three dimensions with three axes for Cartesian coordinates was a great convenience for mathematics, I suggested, but an abstraction that had very little to do with actual perception.

I would now describe the ground theory as a theory of the layout of surfaces. By layout, I mean the relations of surfaces to the ground and to one another, their arrangement. The layout includes both places and objects, together with other features. The theory asserts that the perception of surface layout is direct. This means that perception does not begin with two-dimensional form perception. Hence, there is no special kind of perception called depth perception, and the third dimension is not lost in the retinal image since it was never in the environ- ment to begin with. It is a loose term. If depth means the dimension of an object that goes with height and width, there is nothing special about it. Height becomes depth when the object is seen from the top, and width becomes depth when the object is seen from the side. If depth means distance from here, then it involves self-perception and is continually changing as the observer moves about. The theory of depth perception is based on confusion and perpetuated by the fallacy of the retinal picture. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 141

I now say that there is information in ambient light for the perception of the layout of surfaces but not that there are cues or clues for the perception of depth. The traditional list of cues is worthless if perception does not begin with a flat picture. I tried to reformulate the list in 1950 as "gradients and steps of retinal stimulation"(Gibson, 1950b, pp. 137 ff.). The hypothesis of gradients was a good beginning, but the reformulation failed. It had the great handicap of being based on physiological optics and the retinal image instead of ecological optics and the ambient array.

Such is the hypothesis of the direct perception of surface layout. What is the evidence to support it? Some experiments had been carried out even before 1950, outdoor experiments in the open air instead of laboratory experiments with spots of light in a darkroom, but they were only a beginning (Gibson, 1947). Much more experimental evidence has accumulated in the last twenty- five years.

The Psychophysics of Space and Form Perception

The studies to be described were thought of as psychophysical experiments at the time they were performed. There was to be a new psychophysics of percep- tion as well as the old psychophysics of sensation. For I thought I had discovered that there were stimuli for perceptions in much the same way that there were known to be stimuli for sensations. This now seems to me a mistake. I failed to distinguish between stimulation proper and stimulus information, between what happens at passive receptors and what is available to active perceptual systems. Traditional psychophysics is a laboratory discipline in which physical stimuli are applied to an observer. He is prodded with controlled and systemat- ically varied bits of energy so as to discover how his experience varies corres- pondingly. This procedure makes it difficult or impossible for the observer to extract invariants over time. Stimulus prods do not ordinarily carry informa- tion about the environment.

What I had in mind by a psychophysics of perception was simply the emphasis on perception as direct instead of indirect. I wanted to exclude an extra process of inference or construction. I meant (or should have meant) that animals and people sense the environment, not in the meaning of having sensations but in the meaning of detecting. When I asserted that a gradient in the retinal image was a stimulus for perception, I meant only that it was sensed as a unit; it was not a collection of points whose separate sensations had to be put together in the brain. But the concept of the stimulus was not clear to me. I should have asserted that a gradient is stimulus information. For it is first of all an invariant property of an optic array. I should not have implied that a percept was an automatic response to a stimulus, as a sense impression is supposed to be. For even then I realized that perceiving is an act, not a response, an act of attention, not a trig- gered impression, an achievement, not a reflex. 142 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

So what I should have meant by a "psychophysical"theory of perception in 1950 and by perception as a "function of stimulation"in the essay I wrote in 1959 (Gibson, 1959) was the hypothesis of a one-stage process for the percep- tion of surface layout instead of a two-stage process of first perceiving flat forms and then interpreting the cues for depth.

I now believe that there is no such thing as flat-form perception, just as there is no such thing as depth perception. (There are drawings and pictures, to be sure, but these are not "forms," as I will explain in Part IV. The theory of form perception in psychology is no less confused than the theory of depth percep- tion.) But this was not clear when I wrote my book in 1950, where I promised not only a psychophysics of space perception in Chapter 5 but also a psychophys- ical approach to form perception in Chapter 10. This sounded promising and progressive. Visual outline forms, I suggested, are not unique entities. "They could be arranged in a systematic way such that each form would differ only gradually and continuously from all others" (Gibson, 1950b, p. 193). What counts is not the form as such but the dimensions of variation of form. And psychophys- ical experiments could be carried out if these dimensions were isolated.

Here was the germ of the modern hypothesis of the distinctive features of graphic symbols. It also carries the faint suggestion of a much more radical hypothesis, that what the eye picks up is a sequential transformation, not a form. The study of form discrimination by psychophysical methods has flour- ished in the last thirty years. W. R. Garner, Julian Hochberg, Fred Attneave, and others have achieved the systematic variation of outline forms and patterns in elegant ways(e.g., Garner, 1974). My objection to this research is that it tells us nothing about perceiving the environment. It still assumes that vision is simplest when there is a form on the retina that copies a form on a surface facing the retina. It perpetuates the fallacy that form perception is basic. It holds back the study of invariants in a changing array. But the hypothesis that forms are directly perceived does not upset the orthodoxies of visual theory as does the hypothesis that invariants are directly perceived, and hence it is widely accepted.

The psychophysical approach to surface perception is much more radical than the psychophysical approach to form perception, and it has not been widely accepted over the last twenty-five years. Has its promise been fulfilled? Some experiments can be summarized, and the evidence should be pulled together. Experiments on the Perception of a Surface as Distinguished

from Nothing

Metzger's Experiment

Is tridimensional space perception based on bidimensional sensations to which the third dimension is added, or is it based on surface perception? The first experiment bearing on this issue is that of W. Metzger in 1930. He faced the Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 143 eyes of his observer with a large, dimly lighted plaster wall, which rendered the light coming to the visual system unfocusable. Neither eye could accommodate, and probably the eyes could not converge. The total field (Ganzfeld) was, as he put it, homogeneous. Under high illumination, the observer simply perceived the wall, and the outcome was so obvious as to be uninteresting. But under low illumination, the fine-grained texture of the surface was no longer registered by a human eye, and the observer reported seeing what he called a fog or haze or mist of light. He certainly did not see a surface in two dimensions, and therefore Metzger was tempted to conclude that he saw something in three dimensions; that is, he was perceiving "space."

But I did not see depth in the "mist of light." Another way to get a homo- geneous field is to confront the eyes with a hemisphere of diffusing glass highly illuminated from the outside (Gibson and Dibble, 1952). A better way is to cover each eye with a fitted cap of strongly diffusing translucent material worn like a pair of goggles (Gibson and Waddell, 1952). The structure of the entering light, the optical texture, can thus be eliminated at any level of intensity. What my observers and I saw under these conditions could better be described as "nothing"in the sense of "no thing."It was like looking at the sky. There was no surface and no object at any distance. Depth was not present in the experi- ence but missing from it. What the observer saw, as I would now put it, was an empty medium.

The essence of Metzger's experiment and its subsequent repetitions is not the plaster wall or the panoramic surface or the diffusing glass globe or the eye- caps. The experiment provides discontinuities in the light to an eye at one extreme and eliminates them at the other. The purpose of the experiment is to control and vary the projective capacity oflight. This must be isolated from the stimulating capacity of light. Metzger's experiment points to the distinction between an optic array with structure and a nonarray without structure. To the extent that the array has structure it specifies an environment.

A number of experiments using a panoramic surface under low illumination have been carried out, although the experimenters did not always realize what they were doing. But all the experiments involved more or less faint discon- tinuities in the light to the eye. What the observers said they saw is complex and hard to describe. One attempt was made by W. Cohen in 1957, and the other experiments have been surveyed by L. L. Avant (1965). It is fair to say that there are intermediate perceptions between seeing nothing and seeing something as the discontinuities become stronger. These are the polar opposites of perception that are implied by Metzger's experiment, not the false opposites of seeing in two dimensions and seeing in three dimensions.

The confusion over whether there is or is not "depth"in Metzger's luminous fog is what led me to think that the whole theory of depth, distance, the third dimension, and space is misconceived. The important result is the neglected one that a surface is seen when the array has structure, that is, differences in 144 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

different directions. A perfectly flat surface in front of the eyes is still a layout, that is, a wall. And that is all that "seeing in two dimensions" can possibly mean.

The Experiment with Translucent Eye-Caps

Eliminating optical texture from the light entering the eye by means of trans- lucent diffusing goggles is an experiment that has been repeated many times. The observer is blind, not to light, for the photoreceptors are still stimulated, but to the environment, for the ocular system is inactivated; its adjustments are frustrated. The observer cannot look at or look around, and I shall devote a chapter to this activity later. The eye-caps have also been adapted for experi- ments on the development of vision in young animals. It was known that when diurnal animals such as primates were reared from birth in complete darkness they were blind by certain criteria when brought into an illuminated environ- ment (although this was not true of nocturnal animals whose ancestors were used to getting around in the dark). Now it was discovered that animals deprived of optical structure but not of optical stimulation were also partly blind when the eye-caps were removed. Crudely speaking, they could not use their eyes properly. Anatomical degeneration of the photoreceptors had not occurred, as with the animals reared in the dark, but the exploratory adjust- ments of the visual system had not developed normally. The experiments are described in Chapter 12 of Perceptual Learning and Development by Eleanor J. Gibson(1969).

Experiments with a Sheet of Glass

It is fairly well known that a clean sheet of plate glass that projects no reflections or highlights to the observer's eye is, as we say, invisible. This fact is not self- explanatory, but it is very interesting. It means that one perceives air where a material surface exists, because air is specified by the optic array. I have seen people try to walk through plate-glass doors to their great discomfiture and deer try to jump through plate-glass windows with fatal results.

A perfectly clear sheet of glass transmits both light considered as energy and an array of light considered as information. A frosted or pebbled sheet of glass transmits optical energy but not optical information. The clear sheet can be seen through, as we say, but the frosted sheet cannot. The latter can be seen, but the former cannot. An imperceptible sheet of glass can be made increasingly perceptible by letting dust or powder fall on it or by spattering it. Even the faintest specks can specify the surface. In this intermediate case, the sheet trans- mits both the array from the layout behind the glass and the array from the glass itself. We say that we see the farther surface through the glass surface. The optical structure of one is mixed or interspersed with the optical structure of the other. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 145 The transparency of the near surface, more properly its semitransparency, is then perceived (Gibson, 1976). One sees two surfaces, separated in depth, in the same direction from here or, better, within the same visual solid angle of the ambient array. At least one sees them separated if the interspersed structures are different, or if the elements of one move relative to the elements of the other (E. J. Gibson, Gibson, Smith, and Flock, 1959).

Many of the above assertions are based on informal experiments that have not been published. But the reader can check them for himself with little trouble. I conclude that a surface is experienced when the structural informa- tion to specify it is picked up.

Experiments with a Pseudotunnel

In the case of a sheet of glass, a surface may exist and go unperceived if it is not specified. In the next experiment, a surface may be nonexistent but may be perceived if it is specified. The pseudosurface in this case was not flat and frontal but was a semienclosure, a cylindrical tunnel viewed from one end. I called it an optical tunnel to suggest that the surface was not material or substan- tial but was produced by the light to the eye. Another way of describing it would be to say that it was a virtual but not a real tunnel.

The purpose of the experiment was to provide information for the percep- tion of the inside surface of a cylinder without the ordinary source of this information, the inside surface of a cylinder. I would now call this a display. The fact that the perception was illusory is incidental. I wanted to elicit a synthetic perception, and I, therefore, had to synthesize the information. It was an exper- iment in perceptual psychophysics, more exactly, psycho-optics. The observers were fooled, to be sure, but that was irrelevant. There was no information in the array to specify that it was a display. This situation, I shall argue, is very rare.

My collaborators and I (Gibson, Purdy, and Lawrence, 1955)generated a visual solid angle of about 30° at the point of observation. This array consisted of alternating dark and light rings nested within one another, separated by abrupt circular contours. The number of rings and contours from the periphery to the center of the array could be varied. At one extreme there were thirty-six contours, and at the other seven.

Thus the mean density of the contrasts in the array was varied from fine to coarse. The gradient of this density could also be varied; normally the density increased from the periphery toward the center.

The source of this display, the apparatus, was a set of large, very thin, plastic sheets, each hiding the next, with a one-foot hole cut in the center of each. They were indirectly illuminated from above or below. The contours in the array were caused by the edges of the sheets. The texture of the plastic was so fine as to be invisible. Black and white sheets could be hung in alternation one behind another. or. as a control. all-black or all-white surfaces could be 146 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.1 The optic array coming to the eye from the optical tunnel.

There are nine contrasts in this cross-section of the array, that is, nine transitions of luminous intensity. The next figure shows a longitudinal section. The point of obser- vation for the figure on the left is centered with the tunnel, whereas the point of obser- vation for the figure on the right is to the right of center. (From J. J. Gibson, J. Purdy, and L. Lawrence: "A Method of Controlling Stimulation for the Study of Space Perception: The Optical Tunnel,"Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1955, 50, 1-14.

FIGURE 9.2 A longitudinal section of the optical tunnel shown in Figure 9.1.

Nine plastic sheets are shown, black and white alternating, with the cut edges of the nine holes aligned. The increase in the density of the contrasts from the peri- phery to the center of the array is evident. (From J. J. Gibson, J. Purdy, and L. Lawrence: "A Method of Controlling Stimulation for the Study of Space Perception: The Optical Tunnel," Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1955，50，1-14. Copyright 1955 by the American Psychological Association. Reprinted by permission.) Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 147 displayed. The observers looked into these holes from a booth, and extreme precautions were taken to prevent them from having any preconception of what they would see.

The principal result was as follows. When all-black or all-white surfaces were used, the observers saw nothing; the area within the first hole was described as a hazy or misty fog, a dark or light film, without obvious depth. At the other extreme, when thirty-six dark and light rings were displayed, all observers saw a continuous striped cylindrical surface, a solid tunnel. No edges were seen, and "a ball could be rolled from the far end to the entrance."

When nineteen contrasts were displayed, two-thirds of the observers described a solid tunnel. When thirteen contrasts were displayed, half did so: and when seven contrasts were displayed, only one-third did so. In each case, the remainder said they saw either segments of surface with air in between or a series of circular edges (which was, of course, correct). With fewer contrasts, the experience became progressively less continuous and substantial. The prox- imity of these contours had proved to be crucial. Surfaciness depended on their mean density in the array.

What about the cylindrical shape of the surface, the receding layout of the tunnel? This could be altered in a striking way and the tunnel converted into a flat surface like an archery target with rings around a bull's-eye simply by rearranging the sheets in the way illustrated. The gradient of increasing prox- imity toward the center of the array gives way to an equal proximity. But the target surface instead of the tunnel surface appeared only if the observer's head was fixed and one eye was covered, that is, if the array was frozen and single. If the head was moved or the other eye used, the tunnel shape was again seen. The frozen array specified a flat target, but the dual or transforming array specified a receding tunnel. This is only one of many experiments in which perception with monocular fixed vision is exceptional.

Conclusion

These experiments with a dimly lighted wall, with translucent eye-caps, with a sheet of glass, and with a pseudotunnel seem to show that the perception of surfaciness depends on the proximity to one another of discontinuities in the optic array. A surface is the interface between matter in the gaseous state and matter in the liquid or solid state. A surface comes to exist as the matter on one side of the interface becomes more substantial (Chapter 2). The medium is insubstantial. Mists, clouds, water, and solids are increasingly substantial. These substances are also increasingly opaque, except for a substance like glass, which is rare in nature. What these experiments have done is to vary systematically the optical information for the perception of substantiality and opacity. (But see the next chapter on the perception of coherence.) 148 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.3 An arrangement that provides an array with a constant density of contrasts from periphery to center.

Only the first seven apertures are shown. The observer does not see a tunnel with this display but a flat surface with concentric rings, something like an archery target, so long as the head is immobile and one eye is covered. (From J. J. Gibson, J. Purdy, and L. Lawrence: "A Method of Controlling Stimulation for the Study ofSpace Perception: The Optical Tunnel," Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1955，50，1-14. Copyright 1955 by the American Psychological Association. Reprinted by permission.)

The experiment with the pseudotunnel also seems to show that the percep- tion of a surface as such entails the perception of its layout, such as the front- facing layout of a wall or the slanting layout of a tunnel. Both are kinds of layout, and the traditional distinction between two-dimensional and three- dimensional vision is a myth.

Experiments on the Perception of the Surface of Support

The ground outdoors or the floor indoors is the main surface of support. Animals have to be supported against gravity. If the layout of surfaces is to be substituted for space in the theory of perception, this fundamental surface should get first consideration. How is it perceived? Animals like us can always feel the surface of support except when falling freely. But we can also see the surface of support under our feet if we are, in fact, supported. The ground is always specified in the lower portion of the ambient array. The standing infant can always see it and can always see her feet hiding parts of it. This is a law of ecological optics.

The Glass Floor

A floor can be experimentally modified. When the "visual cliff" was being constructed for experiments with young animals by E. J. Gibson and R. D. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 149 Walk (1960), observations were made with a large sheet of glass that was hori- zontal instead of vertical, a glass floor instead of a glass wall. The animal or child can be put down on this surface under two conditions: when it is visible, by virtue of textured paper placed just under the glass, and when it is invisible, with the paper placed far below the glass. The glass affords support under both conditions but provides optical information for support only under the first. There is mechanical contact with the feet in both cases but optical information for contact with the feet only in the first.

The animals or babies tested in this experiment would walk or crawl normally when they could both see and feel the surface but would not do so when they could only feel the surface; in the latter case, they froze, crouched, and showed signs of discomfort. Some animals even adopted the posture they would have when falling (E. J. Gibson and Walk, 1960, pp. 65-66). The conclusion seems to be that some animals require optical information for support along with the inertial and tactual information in order to walk normally. For my part, I should feel very uncomfortable if I had to stand on a large observation platform with a transparent floor through which the ground was seen far below.

The optical information in this experiment, I believe, is contradictory to the haptic information. One sees oneself as being up in the air, but one feels oneself in contact with a surface of support and, of course, one feels the normal pull of gravity in the vestibular organ. In such cases of contradictory or conflicting information, the psychologist cannot predict which will be picked up.The perceptual outcome is uncertain.

Note that the perception of the ground and the coperception of the self are inseparable in this situation. One's body in relation to the ground is what gets attention. Perception and proprioception are complementary. But the commonly accepted theories of space perception do not bring out this fact.

The Visual Cliff

The visual cliff experiments of E. J. Gibson, R. D. Walk, and subsequently others are very well known. They represented a new approach to the ancient puzzle of depth perception, and the results obtained with newborn or dark- reared animals were surprising because they suggested that depth perception was innate. But the sight of a cliff is not a case of perceiving the third dimension. One perceives the affordance of its edge. A cliff is a feature of the terrain, a highly significant, special kind of dihedral angle in ecological geometry, a falling-off place. The edge at the top of a cliff is dangerous. It is an occluding edge. But is has the special character of being an edge of the surface of support, unlike the edge of a wall. One can safely walk around the edge of a wall but not off the edge of a cliff. To perceive a cliffis to detect a layout but, more than that, it is to detect an affordance, a negative affordance for locomotion, a place where the surface of support ends. 150 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

An affordance is for a species of animal, a layout relative to the animal and commensurate with its body. A cliff is a drop-off that is large relative to the size of the animal, and a step is a drop-off that is small relative to its size. A falling-off edge is dangerous, but a stepping-down edge is not. What animals need to perceive is not layout as such but the affordances of the layout, as emphasized in the last chapter. Consider the difference between the edge of a horizontal surface and the edge of a vertical surface, the edge of a floor and the edge of a wall. You go over the former whereas you can go around the latter. Both are dihedral angles, and both are occluding edges. But the meanings of the two kinds of "depth"are entirely different.

Gibson and Walk (1960; Walk and Gibson, 1961) constructed a virtual cliff with the glass-floor apparatus. They tested animals and babies to determine whether or not they would go forward over the virtual cliff. Actually, they provided two edges on either side of a narrow platform, one a falling-off edge and the other a stepping-down edge appropriate to the species of animal being tested. The animals' choices were recorded. Nearly all terrestrial animals chose the shallow edge instead of the deep one.

The results have usually been discussed in terms of depth perception and the traditional cues for depth. But they are more intelligible in terms of the percep- tion of layout and affordances. The separation in depth at an edge of the surface of support is not at all the same thing as the depth dimension of abstract space.

The real object is held up in the air by a hidden rod attached to a heavy base. The virtual object appears to be resting on the ground where the bottom edge of the real object hides the ground, so long as vision is monocular and frozen. One sees a concave corner, not an occluding edge. Because the virtual object is at twice the distance of the real object, it is seen as twice the size. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 151 As for innate versus learned perception, it is much more sensible to assume an innate capacity to notice falling-off places in terrestrial animals than it is to assume that they have innate ideas or mental concepts of geometry.

An Object Resting on the Ground

I suggested that one sees the contact of his feet with the ground. This is equally true for other objects than feet. We see whether an object is on the ground or up in the air. How is this contact with or separation from the ground perceived? The answer is suggested by an informal experiment described in my book on the visual world (Gibson, 1950b, Fig. 72，pp. 178 ff.), which might be called the invisibly-supported-object experiment. I did not clearly understand it at the time, but the optics of occluding edges now makes it more intelligible.

A detached object can be attached to a long rod that is hidden to the observer. The rod can be lowered by the experimenter so that the obiect rests on the ground or raised so that it stands up in the air. The object can be a cardboard rectangle or trapezoid or a ball, but it must be large enough to hide the rod and its base. An observer who stands at the proper position and looks with two eyes, or with one eye and a normally moving head, perceives a resting object as resting on the surface of support and a raised object as raised above the surface of support. The size and distance of the object are seen correctly. But an observer who looks with one eye and a fixed head, through a peephole or with a biting board, gets an entirely different perception. A resting object is seen correctly, but a raised object is also seen to be resting on the surface. It is seen at the place where its edge hides the texture of the surface. It appears farther away and larger than it really is.

This illusion is very interesting. It appears only with monocular arrested vision-a rare and unnatural kind of vision. The increments and decrements of the texture of the ground at the edges of the object have been eliminated, both those of one eye relative to the other and those that are progressive in time at each eye. In traditional theory, the cues of binocular and motion parallax are absent. But it is just these increments and decrements of the ground texture that specify the separation of object from ground. The absence of this accretion/dele- tion specifies contact of the object with the ground. A surface is perceived to "stand up"or "stand out"from the surface that extends behind it only to the extent that the gap is specified. And this depends on seeing from different points of observation, either two points of observation at the same time or different points of observation at different times.

A flat surface that "goes back to" or "lies flat on" the ground will seem to have a different size, shape, and even reflectance than it has when it stands forth in the air. This feature of the illusion is also very interesting, and I have demon- strated it many times. The first published study of it is that of J. E. Hochberg and J. Beck (1954). 152 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Experiments with the Ground as Background

Investigators in the tradition of space perception and the cues for depth have

usually done experiments with a background in the frontal plane, that is, a

surface facing the observer, a wall, a screen, or a sheet of paper. A form in this

plane is most similar to a form on the retina, and extension in this plane might

be seen as a simple sensation. This follows from retinal image optics. But invest-

igators of environment perception do experiments with the ground as back-

ground, studying surfaces instead of forms, and using ecological optics. Instead

of studying distance in the air, they study recession along the ground. Distance

as such cannot be seen directly but can only be inferred or computed. Recession

along the ground can be seen directly.

Distance and Size Perception on the Ground

Although the linear perspective of a street in a painting had been known since

the Renaissance, and the converging appearance of a parallel alley of trees in a

landscape had been discussed since the eighteenth century, no one had ever

studied the perception of a naturally textured ground. Linear perspective was

an obvious cue for distance, but the gradient of density or proximity of the

texture of the ground was not so obvious. E. G. Boring has described the old

experiments with artificial alleys (1942，pp. 290-296)，but the first experiment

with an ordinary textured field outdoors, I believe, was published at the end of

World War II (Gibson, 1947). A plowed field without furrows receding almost

to the horizon was used. No straight edges were visible. This original experi-

ment required the judgment of the height of a stake planted in the field at some

distance up to half a mile. At such a distance the optical size of the elements of

texture and the optical size of the stake itself were extremely small.

Up until that time the unanimous conclusion of observers had been that

parallel lines were seen to converge and that objects were seen to be smaller"in

the distance." There was a tendency toward "size constancy"of objects, to be

sure, but it was usually incomplete. The assumption had always been that size

constancy must "break down." It was supposed that an object will cease to be

even visible at some eventual distance and that presumably it ceases to be visible

by way of becoming smaller. (See Gibson, 1950b, p. 183, for a statement of this

line of reasoning.) With the naive observers in the open field experiment,

however, the judgments of the size of the stake did not decrease, even when it

was a ten-minute walk away and becoming hard to make out. The judgments

became more variable with distance but not smaller. Size constancy did not break

down. The size of the object only became less definite with distance, not smaller. The implication of this result, I now believe, is that certain invariant ratios were

picked up unawares by the observers and that the size of the retinal image went

unnoticed. No matter how far away the object was, it intercepted or occluded the Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 153 same number of texture elements of the ground. This is an invariant ratio. For any distance the proportion of the stake extending above the horizon to that extending below the horizon was invariant. This is another invariant ratio. These invariants are not cues but information for direct size perception. The observers in this experiment were aviation trainees and were not interested in the perspective appearance of the terrain and the objects. They could not care less for the patch- work of colors in the visual field that had long fascinated painters and psycholo- gists. They were set to pick up information that would permit a size-match between the distant stake and one of a set of nearby stakes. The perception of the size and distance of an object on the ground had proved to be unlike the percep- tion of the size and distance of an object in the sky. The invariants are missing in the latter case. The silhouette of an airplane might be a fifty-foot fighter at a one- mile altitude or a hundred-foot bomber at a two-mile altitude. Airplane spotters could be trained to estimate altitude, but only by the method of recognizing the shape, knowing the size by having memorized the wingspan, and inferring the distance from the angular size. Errors were considerable at best. This kind of infer- ential knowledge is not characteristic of ordinary perception. Baron von Helmholtz called it "unconscious"inference even in the ordinary case, but I am skeptical.

Comparison of Stretches of Distance Along the Ground

The size of an object on the ground is not entirely separable from the sizes of the objects that compose the ground. The terrain is made of clods and particles of earth, or rocks and pebbles, or grass clumps and grass blades. These nested objects might have size constancy just as much as orthodox objects. In the next set of experiments on ground perception, the very distinction between size and distance breaks down. What had to be compared were not stakes or obiects but stretches of the ground itself, distances between markers placed by the experi- menter. In this case distances between here and there could be compared with distances between there and there. These open-field experiments were conducted by Eleanor J. Gibson (Gibson and Bergman, 1954; Gibson, Bergman, and Purdy, 1955; Purdy and Gibson, 1955).

Markers could be set down and moved anywhere in a level field of grass up to 350 yards away. The most interesting experiment of the series required the observer to bisect a stretch of distance. which could extend either from his feet to a marker or from one marker to another (Purdy and Gibson, 1955). A mobile marker on wheels had to be stopped by the observer at the halfway point. The ability to bisect a length had been tested in the laboratory with an adjustable stick called a Galton bar but not with a piece of ground on which the observer stood.

All observers could bisect a stretch of distance without difficulty and with some accuracy. The farther stretch could be matched to the nearer one, although the visual angles did not match. The farther visual angle was compressed 154 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

relative to the nearer, and its surface was, to use a vague term, foreshortened. But no constant error was evident. A stretch from here to there could be equated with a stretch from there to there. The conclusion must be that observers were not paying attention to the visual angles; they must have been noticing inform- ation. They might have been detecting, without knowing it, the amount of texture in a visual angle. The number of grass clumps projected in the farther half of a stretch of distance is exactly the same as the number projected in the nearer half. It is true that the optical texture of the grass becomes denser and more vertically compressed as the ground recedes from the observer, but the rule of equal amounts of texture for equal amounts of terrain remains invariant.

This is a powerful invariant. It holds for either dimension of the terrain, for width as well as for depth. In fact, it holds for any regularly textured surface whatever, that is, any surface of the same substance. And it holds for walls and ceilings as well as for floors. To say that a surface is regularly textured is only to assume that bits of the substance tend to be evenly spaced. They do not have to be perfectly regular like crystals in a lattice but only "stochastically"regular.

The implications of this experiment on fractionating a stretch of the ground are radical and far-reaching. The world consists not only of distances from here, my world, but also of distances from there, the world of another person. These intervals seem to be strikingly equivalent.

The rule of equal amounts of texture for equal amounts of terrain suggests that both size and distance are perceived directly. The old theory that the perceiver allows for the distance in perceiving the size of something is unneces- sary. The assumption that the cues for distance compensate for the sensed small- ness of the retinal image is no longer persuasive. Note that the pickup of the amount of texture in a visual solid angle of the optic array is not a matter of counting units, that is, of measuring with an arbitrary unit. The other experi- ments of this open-field series required the observers to make absolute judg- ments, so-called, of distances in terms of yards. They could learn to do so readily enough (E. J. Gibson and Bergman, 1954； E. J. Gibson, Bergman, and Purdy, 1955), but it was clear that one had to see the distance before one could apply a number to it.

Observations of the Ground and the horizon

When the terrain is flat and open, the horizon is in the ambient optic array. It is a great circle between the upper and the lower hemisphere separating the sky and the earth. But this is a limiting case. The farther stretches of the ground are usually hidden by frontal surfaces such as hills, trees, and walls. Even in an enclosure, however, there has to be a surface of support, a textured floor. The maximum coarseness of its optical texture is straight down, where the feet are, and the density increases outward from this center. These radial gradients projected from the surface of support increase with increasing size of the floor. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 155 The densities of texture do not become infinite except when there is an infin- itely distant horizon. Only at this limit is the optical structure of the array wholly compressed. But the gradients of density specify where the outdoors horizon would be, even in an enclosure. That is, there exists an implicit horizon even when the earth-sky horizon is hidden.

EVEN SPACING

The fact that the parts of the terrestrial environment tend to be "evenly

spaced"was noted in my early book on the visual world (Gibson, 1950b,

pp. 77-78). This is equivalent to the rule of equal amounts of texture for

equal amounts of terrain. The fact can be stated in various ways. However

stated, it seems to be a fact that can be seen, not necessarily an intellectual

concept of abstract space including numbers and magnitudes. Ecological

geometry does not have to be learned from textbooks.

The concept of a vanishing point comes from artificial perspective, conver- ging parallels, and the theory of the picture plane. The vanishing limit of optical structure at the horizon comes from natural perspective, ecological optics, and the theory of the ambient optic array. The two kinds of perspective should not be confused, although they have many principles in common (Chapter 5).

The terrestrial horizon is thus an invariant feature of terrestrial vision, an invariant of any and all ambient arrays, at any and all points of observation. The horizon never moves, even when every other structure in the light is changing. This stationary great circle is, in fact, that to which all optical motions have reference. It is neither subjective nor objective; it expresses the reciprocity of observer and environment; it is an invariant of ecological optics.

The horizon is the same as the skyline only in the case of the open ground or the open ocean. The earth-sky contrast may differ from the true horizon because of hills or mountains. The horizon is perpendicular to the pull of gravity and to the two poles of the ambient array at the centers of the two hemi- spheres; in short, the horizon is horizontal. With reference to this invariant, all other objects, edges, and layouts in the environment are judged to be either upright or tilted. In fact, the observer perceives himself to be in an upright or tilted posture relative to this invariant. (For an early and more complex discussion of visual uprightness and tilt in terms of the retinal image, see Gibson, 1952, on the "phenomenal vertical.")

The facts about the terrestrial horizon are scarcely mentioned in traditional optics. The only empirical study of it is one by H. A. Sedgwick (1973)based on ecological optics. He shows how the horizon is an important source of invariant information for the perception of all kinds of objects. All terrestrial objects, for 156 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.5 The base of each pillar covers the same amount of the texture of the ground.

The width of each pillar is that of one paving stone. The pillars will be seen to have the same width if this information is picked up. The height of each pillar is specified by a similar invariant, the "horizon-ratio"relation, described later.

example, of the same height are cut by the horizon in the same ratio, no matter what the angular size of the object may be. This is the "horizon ratio relation" in its simplest form. Any two trees or poles bisected by the horizon are the same height, and they are also precisely twice my eye-height. More complex ratios specify more complex layouts. Sedgwick showed that judgments of the sizes of objects represented in pictures were actually determined by these ratios.

The perceiving of what might be called eye level on the walls, windows, trees, poles, and buildings of the environment is another case of the comple- mentarity between seeing the layout of the environment and seeing oneself in the environment. The horizon is at eye level relative to the furniture of the earth. But this is my eye level, and it goes up and down as I stand and sit. If I want my eye level, the horizon, to rise above all the clutter of the environment, I must climb up to a high place. The perception of here and the perception of infinitely distant from here are linked.

Experiments on the Perception of Slant

Experiments on the direct perception of layout began in 1950. From the begin- ning, the crucial importance of the density of optical texture was evident. How could it be varied systematically in an experiment? Along with the outdoor experiments, I wanted to try indoor experiments in the laboratory. I did not Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 157 then understand ambient light but only the retinal image, and this led me to experiment with texture density in a window or picture. The density could be increased upward in the display (or downward or rightward or leftward), and the virtual surface would then be expected to slant upward (or downward or whatever). The surface should slant away in the direction of increasing texture density; it should be inclined from the frontal plane at a certain angle that corresponded to the rate of change of density, the gradient of density. Every piece of surface in the world, I thought, had this quality of slant (Gibson, 1950a). The slant of the apparent surface behind the apparent window could be judged by putting the palm of the hand at the same inclination from the frontal plane and recording it with an adjustable "palm board." This appeared to be a neat psychophysical experiment, for it isolated a variable, the gradient of density.

The first experiment (Gibson 1950a) showed that with a uniform density over the display the phenomenal slant is zero and that with increases of density in a given direction one perceives increasing slant in that direction. But the apparent slant was not proportional to the geometrically predicted slant. It was less than it should be theoretically. The experiment has been repeated with modifications by Gibson and J. Cornsweet (1952)，J. Beck and J. J. Gibson (1955)，R. Bergman and J. J. Gibson (1959), and many other investigators. It is not a neat psychophysical experiment. Phenomenal slant does not simply correspond to the gradient. The complexities of the results are described by H. R. Flock (1964, 1965)and by R. B. Freeman (1965).

What was wrong with these experiments? In consideration of the theory of layout, we can now understand it. The kind of slant studied was optical, not geographical, as noted by Gibson and Cornsweet (1952). It was relative to the frontal plane perpendicular to the line of sight, not relative to the surface of the earth, and was thus merely a new kind of depth, a quality added to each of the flat forms in the patchwork of the visual field. I had made the mistake of thinking that the experience of the layout of the environment could be compounded of all the optical slants of each piece of surface. I was thinking of slant as an absolute quality, whereas it is always relative. Convexities and concav- ities are not made up of elementary impressions of slant but are instead unitary features of the layout.

The impression of slant cannot be isolated by displaying a texture inside a window, for the perception of the occluding edge of the window will affect it; the surface is slanted relative to the surface that has the window in it. The separation of these surfaces is underestimated, as the experimental results showed.

The supposedly absolute judgment of the slant of a surface behind a window becomes more accurate when a graded decrease of velocity of the texture across the display is substituted for a graded increase of density of the texture, as demon- strated by Flock (1964). The virtual surface "stands back" from the virtual window. It slants away in the direction of decreasing flow of the texture but is 158 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.6 The invariant horizon ratio for terrestrial objects.

The telephone poles in this display are all cut by the horizon in the same ratio. The proportion differs for objects of different heights. The line where the horizon cuts the tree is just as high above the ground as the point of observation, that is, the height of the observer's eye. Hence everyone can see his own eye-height on the standing objects of the terrain.

perceived to be a rigidly moving surface if the flow gradient is mathematically appropriate. But this experiment belongs not with experiments on surface layout but with those on changing surface layout, and these experiments will be described later.

Is There Evidence Against the Direct Perception of

Surface Layout?

There are experiments, of course, that seem to go against the theory of a direct perception of layout and to support the opposite theory of a mediated perception of layout. The latter theory is more familiar. It asserts that perception is medi- ated by assumptions, preconceptions, expectations, mental images, or any of a dozen other hypothetical mediators. The demonstrations of Adelbert Ames, once very popular, are well known for being interpreted in this way, especially the Distorted Room and the Rotating Trapezoidal Window.

These demonstrations are inspired by the argument from equivalent configura- tions. A diagram illustrating equivalent configurations is given in Figure 9.7. The argument is that many possible objects can give rise to one retinal image and that hence a retinal image cannot specify the object that gave rise to it. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 159 But the image, according to the argument, is all one has for information. The perception of an object, therefore, requires an assumption about which of the many possible objects that could exist gave rise to the present image (or to the visual solid angle corresponding to it). The argument is supposed to apply to each of a collection of objects in space.

A distorted room with trapezoidal surfaces can be built so as to give rise to a visual solid angle at the point of observation identical with the solid angle from a normal rectangular room. Or a trapezoidal window with trapezoids for windowpanes can be built and made to rotate so that its changing visual solid angle is identical with the changing solid angle from a rectangular window slanted 45° away from the real distorted window. The window is always one- eighth of a rotation behind itself, as it were. A single and stationary point of observation is taken for granted. An observer who looks with one eye and a stationary head misperceives the trapezoidal surfaces and has the experience of a set of rectangular surfaces, a "virtual" form or window, instead of the actual plywood construction invented by the experimenter. Anomalies of perception result that are striking and curious. The eye has been fooled.

The explanation is that, in the absence of information, the observer has presup- posed (assumed, expected, or whatever) the existence of rectangular surfaces causing the solid angles at the eye. That is reasonable, but it is then concluded that presuppositions are necessary for perception in general, since a visual solid angle cannot specify its object. There will always be equivalent configurations for any solid angle or any set of solid angles at a point of observation.

The main fallacy in this conclusion, as the reader will recognize, is the generalization from peephole observation to ordinary observation, the assump- tion that because the perspective structure of an optic array does not specify the surface layout nothing in the array can specify the layout. The hypothesis of invariant structure that underlies the perspective structure and emerges clearly when there is a shift in the point of observation goes unrecognized. The fact is that when an observer uses two eyes and certainly when one looks from various points of view the abnormal room and the abnormal window are perceived for what they are, and the anomalies cease.

The demonstrations do not prove, therefore, that the perception of layout cannot be direct and must be mediated by preconceptions, as Adelbert Ames and his followers wanted to believe (Ittelson, 1952). Neither do the many other demonstrations that, over the centuries, have purported to prove it.

The diagram of equivalent configurations illustrates one of the perplexities inherent to the retinal image theory of perception: if many different objects can give rise to the same stimulus, how do we ever perceive an object? The other half of the puzzle is this: if the same object can give rise to many different stimuli, how can we perceive the object? (Note that the second question implies a moving object but that neither question admits the fact of a moving observer. Koffka was perplexed by this dual puzzle (1935，pp. 228 ff) and many other experimenters have tried to 160 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.7 Equivalent configurations within the same visual solid angle.

This perspective drawing shows a rectangle and three transparent trapezoids, all of which fit within the envelope of the same visual solid angle. Thus all four quadrangles are theoretically equivalent for a single eye at a fixed point of observation. They are, however, ghosts, not surfaces.

resolve it, but without success (e.g., Beck and Gibson, 1955). The only way out, I now believe, is to abandon the dogma that a retinal stimulus exists in the form of a picture. What specifies an object are invariants that are themselves "formless."

Summary

The experiment of providing either structure or no structure in the light to an eye results in the perception of a surface or no surface. The difference is not between seeing in two dimensions and seeing in three dimensions, as earlier investigators supposed.

The closer together the discontinuities in an experimentally induced optic array, the greater is the "surfaciness"of the perception. This was true, at least, for a 30° array having seven contours at one extreme and thirty-six at the other.

Optical contact of one's body with the surface of support as well as mechan- ical contact seem to be necessary for some terrestrial animals if they are to stand and walk normally.

Perceiving the meaning of an edge in the surface of support, either a falling-off edge or a stepping-down edge, seems to be a capability that animals develop. This is not abstract depth perception but affordance perception.

Experiments on the perception of distance along the ground instead of distance through the air suggest that such perception is based on invariants in the array instead of cues. The rule of equal amounts of texture for equal amounts of terrain is one such invariant, and the horizon ratio relation is another. On this basis, the dimensions of things on the ground are perceived Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 161 directly, and the old puzzle of the constancy of perceived size at different distances does not arise.

The fact of the terrestrial horizon in the ambient array should not be confused with the vanishing point of linear perspective in pictorial optics.

A series of experiments on the perception of the slant of a surface relative to the line of sight did not confirm the absolute gradient hypothesis. The implic- ation was that the slants of surfaces relative to one another and to the ground, the depth-shapes of the layout, are what get perceived.

Experiments based on the argument from equivalent configurations do not prove the need to have presuppositions in order to perceive the environment, since they leave out of account the fact that an observer normally moves about. 

## 10. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self


Evidence for direct visual perception of the persisting layout of the environ- ment was presented in the last chapter. Persistence, however, is only the comple- ment of change. Is there evidence to suggest that the perception of changing layout is also direct?

The Perception of Changing Surface Layout

Along with the traditional assumption that form perception in the frontal plane is basic and simpler to understand goes the assumption that motion perception in the frontal plane is also basic and simpler to understand. The fallacy of the retinal image and the cues for depth underlies the second assumption as much as the first. But the concept of retinal motion as a"scratching of the retina with pencils of light," as I put it (Gibson, 1968b), is so deep-lying that it is even harder to get rid of than the concept of retinal form. (The retina is a skin for stimuli; a point of light can prod the retina and a moving point of light will scratch the retina.) Only gradually and reluctantly did I give it up, and only when forced to do so by experiments. My present hypothesis is that the perception of events depends upon nothing less than disturbances of structure in the ambient array. I described and listed them in Chapter 6. Disturbances of structure can specify events without being similar to them.

Apparatus for the Study of Motion in the Frontal Plane

In order to study a kind of perception, an experimenter must devise an apparatus that will display the information for that kind of perception. Until recently, the principal types of apparatus devised for the perception of motion were as follows. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 163 The Stroboscope and Its Variants

The stroboscope is a device that exposes or flashes different stationary patterns in succession. Cinematography developed from this device (but not television). Since each successive "stimulus"was motionless and the retina was thus never "stimulated"by motion, the motion perceived was said to be only "apparent," not "real." But this assertion is an example of the muddled thinking to which the theory of stimuli can lead. The stimulus information for motion is the change of pattern, and the information is the same for an intermittent change as for a continuous change. The stroboscope demonstrates only that the motion of an object in the world from one place to another does not have to be copied by a corresponding motion of an image on the retina from one point to another in order for the event to be perceived. But we should never have supposed in the first place that the motion did have to be copied on the retina.

The Moving Endless Belt

A striped or textured surface behind a window in the frontal plane can be made to move continuously in a certain direction and at any chosen speed. Many experiments were carried out with this device before I realized what was wrong. The results for speed and velocity, far from being simple, were complex and puzzling. The just-noticeable speed, for example, could not be determined, although if motion on the retina were a stimulus this variable should have an absolute threshold. Eventually I came to suspect that what the eye was picking up was not the"motion"of the surface relative to the window but the progressive revealing and concealing of the elements of the surface at the occluding edges of the window(Gibson, 1968b).

The Rotating Disk Apparatus

If a color wheel is made to rotate slowly instead of rapidly, the motion of the surface of the disk can be seen. The disk can be displayed either behind a circular window or in front of a background. If the observer fixates the center of the disk, no eye movements occur to complicate the retinal image, which is a circle and its surroundings. But does this retinal change constitute a motion, as the term is understood in physics, a rotary spin measured in terms of degrees of arc per second of time? No, it does not. I finally came to understand that the wheeling of the circle in its surrounding is actually a shearing of the texture of the array at the contour of the circle.

A disk of this sort can also be used as a turntable for a blank circular sheet of paper on which forms are drawn. With rotation of the disk the forms undergo orbital motions, and sometimes very curious perceptions result. 164 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The Disk-and-Slot Apparatus

If a spiral line is drawn on such a disk instead of a texture, a perception of expan- sion (or contraction) is induced when the disk is rotated slowly. And if it is screened except for a slot, the perception of a thing moving along the slot will occur. A. Michotte (1963) has used this device to study the perception of one thing bumping another, for example. In these cases, the optical motions in the array of light from the display are radically different from the mechanical motions of the apparatus that produced them. This radical difference has seemed very puzzling to believers in retinal image optics; it becomes intelligible only with the acceptance of ecological optics. The perception of what might be called slot-motion with Michotte's apparatus is particularly interesting, for it seems to depend on what happens optically at the edges of an aperture or window. The Method of Shadow Projection

Beginning with the Chinese shadow plays of antiquity, moving shadows have been cast on a screen to induce the perception of moving objects or persons. The light source must be either very small or very distant to make the contour of the silhouette sharp. The opaque object, the shadow caster, is properly said to be projected on the screen by radiant light, that is, by rectilinear rays. (Note parenthetically that the light from the screen to the point of observation should not be said to be projected, strictly speaking, since it is ambient light and its array consists of visual solid angles, not rays. But I have not conformed to this strict usage. Projection from a very small, near source is polar in that the rays diverge from a point. Projection from a very distant source like the sun is parallel inasmuch as the rays do not diverge.

With an opaque screen, the radiant light and the ambient array are on the same side of the screen and the observer can see the shadow caster. With a translucent screen, however, the light to the screen and the array from the screen can be on opposite sides, and the observer cannot see the shadow caster. The visual solid angle of the shadow surrounded by light constitutes informa- tion for perceiving an object on an empty background, that is, a virtual object seen as if against the sky.

The shadow caster, an opaque surface or object, can be mounted on a trans- parent sheet and caused to move by the experimenter. Or the mount can be treated so as to be opaque in some parts and transparent in others, or to vary from opaque to transparent. The latter case is essentially that of the photo- graphic lantern slide. The projection of photographic pictures, either singly or in sequence, is in principle no more than the casting of shadows on a screen corresponding to the varying opacity of the film.

The motion of the virtual object that an observer sees behind the screen corresponds to the motion of the shadow caster, but with certain inverse Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 165 relationships. Motion away from the observer corresponds to motion away from the point source of light. But the "motion" of the shadow itself on the screen (if it can be called that) is a size change, a minification.

Shadow projection is vastly more flexible and powerful than the other methods for studying the perception of motion. But how to use it for studies of event perception is only now beginning to become clear. The art and techno- logy of the "picture show," as the man in the street calls it, have become fully and elaborately developed in modern times, but without any scientific discipline on which to base them. The production of moving displays with "animated" film, and by means of computer-controlled motions of a cathode ray beam on the screen of an oscilloscope, are both complex elaborations of this method of projection (e.g., Green, 1961； Braunstein, 1962a and b). I will return to the problem of the displaying of optical motions in the last chapter of this book.

Experiments on the Kinetic Depth Effect, or Stereokinesis

C. L. Musatti(1924)demonstrated many years ago that a drawing composed of circles or ellipses that looked flat when stationary would go into depth when it underwent an orbital motion on a turntable. Everybody knew that a pair of flat forms having binocular disparity would go into depth when they were looked at in a stereoscope, but the idea of flat drawing being given depth by motion was surprising. Musatti called it the stereokinetic phenomenon.

The fact seemed to be that certain motions in the frontal plane could generate a perception of motion in depth. The idea was that elementary motions on the retina could combine to give the experience of a real motion in space, the latter being of an entirely different sort from the former. Ten years later, W. Metzger (1934)reported what he called "appearances of depth in moving fields," and much later H. Wallach described what he called the "kinetic depth effect" (Wallach and O'Connell, 1953). No one imagined that a moving volume could be perceived directly, the motion and the volume at the same time, for they assumed that retinal sensations were the necessary basis of perception.

Wallach's kinetic depth effect is obtained when the shadow of a configuartion made of bent wire is projected on a translucent screen and observed from the other side. Without motion the lines appear flat, as if drawn on the screen. But when the wire object is turned the disposition of the wires in space becomes evident. The shift from a flat picture to a moving bent wire is very striking. Why should this occur? Wallach's formula was that the flat pattern went into depth when the lines on the screen changed in both direction and length concurrently (Wallach and O'Connell, 1953).

This formula is not very illuminating. A better one was being worked out at about that time by G. Johansson (1950), to the effect that if a set of several separate motions in the frontal plane can be resolved into some single motion of a rigid volume, then this rigid motion will be perceived in depth. This formula 166 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

is reminiscent of one of Wertheimer's laws of the supposed organization of sensory elements in the brain, the law of "common fate," which says that a collection of spots will be grouped to form a gestalt if they move in the same way. But Wertheimer never said exactly what he meant by "the same way."

Johansson's experiments were carried out at first with moving spots or lines projected on a translucent screen. But he later used a set of luminous elements on the screen of a cathode ray tube, which could be programmed to move in any direction, up, down, right, and left. He used vector analysis to determine the "common motion"in the cluster of elements. Ifthe motions were "coherent," or if the cluster were coherent under motion, the elements would be perceived as an object in depth instead of a mere frontal pattern. They would appear to be a rigidly connected set of elements, like a three-dimensional lattice in space or a polyhedron of solid geometry.

The hypothesis that individual sensory elements are grouped or made to cohere in the process of perception is an axiom of Gestalt theory, which assumes that sensations are the necessary basis of perception. If it were not for the process of organization, the individual sensations of motion would yield individual perceptions of object motion in the frontal plane. The theory of organization with reference to motion is adopted by Metzger (1953)as well as by Johansson (1950). But there is another theoretical possibility, namely, that an optical trans- formation that is already coherent does not have to be made coherent in the process of perception; it is simply picked up. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 167 Experiments with Progressive Magnification or Minification

The first results that began to suggest a direct perception of motion in depth were those of W. Schiff, J. A. Caviness, and J. J. Gibson in 1962. A point-source shadow projector is used with a large translucent screen six feet square and with the point of observation close to the screen. A small, dark silhouette at the center of the screen can be magnified over an interval of several seconds until it fills the screen. The observer sees an indefinite obiect coming at him and coming up to his face. He gets an experience that might justly be called visual collision. Without any mechanical contact, the information for optical contact has been provided. The observer has no sensation of touch, but he blinks his eyes and may duck or dodge involuntarily. It seemed to me that this optical change, whatever it was. should be considered a "stimulus" for the blink reflex as much as a puff of air to the cornea of the eye should be (Gibson, 1957). But it was surely not a stimulus in the ordinary meaning of the term. It was an optical expansion or magnification of an intercept angle toward its theoretical limit of 180°. This is the visual solid angle of natural perspective.

Experiments showed that the size and the distance of the virtual object were indefinite but that its approach was perfectly definite. After the shadow filled the screen, the virtual obiect seemed to be "here," at zero distance. It did not look like a shadow on the screen but looked like an object. The object in fact came out of the screen. This was only to be expected, for, by the laws of natural perspective, the closer an object comes to the point of observation, the closer its solid angle will come to a hemisphere of the ambient array.

There seemed to be a direct perception of an event that could be described as approach-of-something. This perception was not based on a sensation of expan- sion or enlargement. Observers reported that the object did not seem to get larger, as a rubber balloon does, and that they did not notice the increasing size of the shadow as such unless the magnification was quite slow. The object appeared to be rigid, not elastic.

The magnification of the visual solid angle of an obiect normally accelerates as it approaches the limit of a hemispheric angle, as the object comes up to the eye. The accelerated portion of this sequence was called "looming"by Schiff, Caviness, and Gibson (1962). It specifies impending collision, and the rate of magnification is proportional to the imminence of the collision. Schiff (1965)adapted the looming apparatus to test the behavior of animals. He used monkeys, kittens, chicks, frogs, and fiddler crabs. All of them showed avoidance behavior or withdrawal analogous to the ducking or dodging of the human observer. As a control, the animals were presented with minification of the shadow, the temporal reverse of magnification. The animals showed either no response or one that could be interpreted as curiosity. Presumably, what they saw was something going away in the distance but nothing that threatened collision. When the screen was simply darkened (or lightened), the animals did 168 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

not respond. And, of course, the unchanging silhouette on the screen caused no response.

The flinching of the human observer in this experiment usually extin- guished after a few repetitions, but that of the animals mostly did not. However, although the human behavior changed, the human perception did not, that is, the awareness of something approaching did not extinguish with repetition. The perception evidently did not depend on the learning of a conditioned with- drawal response reinforced by mechanical collision.

In other experiments it was established that when the magnification of the shadow was not symmetrical but skewed, the animal (a crab) dodged appropri- ately to the left or right, as the path of the virtual object moved to the right or left of the animal's position (Schiff, 1965, pp. 16-18). Human observers see some- thing approaching but approaching a position off to one side instead of the point of observation being occupied, and they can judge how far the ghostly object would pass by on the right or left. Presumably it is this sort of optical information that one uses in dodging a thrown rock, or catching a thrown ball, for that matter. There will be more about magnification in Chapter 13 on locomotion

The fact that a fiddler crab behaved as if it perceived the same event as the vertebrate animals and the human observers was very suggestive. The crab does not have a camera eye or a retinal image, and retinal image optics cannot be applied to it. But ecological optics works very well for the compound eye, for it is constructed of tubes pointing in different directions (Gibson, 1966b, p. 164). Experiments with Progressive Transformations

In geometry the magnification or minification of a form is sometimes called a size transformation (or a similarity transformation). But the ordinary meaning of the term is change of form, and the most familiar transformation is a perspective transformation. In the theory of perspective drawing, artificial perspective, it is called foreshortening. It is the parameter of transformation that converts a rect- angle into a trapezoid when the rectangular surface is slanted away from the frontal plane. If a progressive transformation was a "stimulus"for space percep- tion, as I thought (Gibson, 1957), then it was more fundamental than the kinetic depth effect and I should carry out a proper psychophysical experiment with this slant transformation. I was still thinking of slant as a basic variable in the perception of layout, and I still had in mind all the experiments that had been done on the perceiving of a constant form with varying slant, the puzzle of form constancy. I was still assuming vaguely that the perceiving of "forms," whatever they were, was basic to other kinds of perceiving.

So my wife and I collaborated in an investigation of what people see with a systematic variation of the amount of foreshortening, using the shadow projec- tion apparatus (Gibson and Gibson, 1957). The shadow projected on the screen was either a regular form (a square), a regular texture (a square of squares), an Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 169 irregular form (ameboid shape), or an irregular texture (a potato-shaped group of small ameboid shapes). Each of these silhouettes underwent cycles of trans- formation, the shadow caster being turned back and forth through an angle that varied from 15° to 70°. The observer had to indicate the amount of change of slant he perceived, using an adjustable protractor.

All subjects without exception perceived the changing slant of an unchanging rigid surface. It was not an object, to be sure, only the face of an object, a sheet, but its shape was definite and it was not in the least elastic. It simply turned back and forth. If one paid attention to it, one could say that the shadow on the screen was squeezed or compressed, but not the sheet. There was no difference between the regular and the irregular silhouettes in this respect. The angle of the change of slant could be judged with considerable accuracy. The regular patterns, however, did not show more accuracy than the irregular, and there was no difference between what I called the forms and the textures.

These results did not fit with the traditional concepts of form and depth percep- tion. They were upsetting. They seemed to imply that a certain change of form could yield a constant form with a change of slant, but this surely involves a muddle of thought. Evidently, the meaning of the term form is slippery and, if so, it is nonsense to talk about form perception (Gibson, 1951). What emerged over time during the cycles of change was a distinctive object. The hypothesis that began to suggest itself was that an object is specified by invariants under transformation. Far

from being forms, these invariants are quite "formless"; they are invariants of structure. Presumably, the four different surfaces in this experiment were specified by different invariants under foreshortening, and the different changes of slant were specified at the same time by different amounts of foreshortening.

An optical transformation, then, was not a set of discrete optical motions. nor was it a cause of depth perception. It was a single, global, lawful change in the array that specified both an unchanging object and its changing position, both at the same time.

The Puzzle of Phenomenal Rigidity

It began to be clear that the heart of the problem lay in the perception of rigidity and the information to specify rigidity, not in the perception of form and depth. Could it be that certain definable transformations in the optic array were specific to rigid motions and that others specified nonrigid motions? More precisely, the hypothesis would be that certain invariants specified rigidity and that other invariants specified elasticity. This line of thinking had great promise. The elastic bending of a sheet or stick preserves connectivity but not proportion- ality. So does the stretching of a sheet or stick. But the breaking of it does not even preserve connectivity, except in the broken parts. And the crumbling of a surface does not even preserve the surface, which, by disintegrating, ceases to exist. The invariants in this hierarchy are linked both to the meaningful substances of the environment and to abstract mathematics.

What experiments were possible? It was not easy to think of a way to isolate and control an invariant. K. von Fieandt and J. J. Gibson (1959) did a more modest experiment. They presented observers with the transformation of compressing followed by its inverse, and then the transformation of foreshort- ening followed by its inverse, to see if observers would spontaneously notice the difference and perceive an elastic event in the first case and a rigid event in the second case. They defined stretching as change in one dimension only, width or height but not both, as exemplified by square-into-rectangle. Foreshortening was exemplified by square-into-trapezoid, as in the Gibson and Gibson experiment described above (1957).

The experimenters projected on the translucent screen the shadow of an irregular elastic fishnet, which was stretched on a frame mounted between the point source and the screen. One end of the frame could be made to slide inward and outward, or the whole frame could be turned back and forth. The frame was invisible, and the texture filled the screen. The motions of the elements on the screen were very similar in the two cases. But observers had no difficulty in distinguishing between the virtual surface in the two cases, elastic in the first and rigid in the second.

Johansson (1964)studied the effects of changing the height and width of a rectangle in a highly ingenious way. He generated a luminous figure on an Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 171 oscilloscope screen with independent control of its height and width. He could stretch and then compress either dimension in repeated cycles. When both dimensions were increased or decreased at the same time, he got magnification and minification, which yielded clear perception of a rigid object approaching and then receding. But he was interested in elastic motion. So he made the cycles of changing height and width out of phase. But he did not then obtain perceptions of the elastic motions of a variable rectangle as one might expect. Instead, there was a strong tendency to see a virtual rectangular object with three parameters of rigid motion, not two, an object turning on a vertical axis, turning on a horizontal axis, and moving forward and backward, all at the same time in different cycles.

We do not yet know the exact basis for the perception of rigidity-elasticity, although research is progressing at both Uppsala in Sweden and at Cornell in the U.S.A. These experiments are curious and interesting and have already produced some surprising discoveries.

An Experiment on the Perception of Separation in Depth

What information specifies the connectedness of an object, its unbroken char- acter? The gestalt theorists had emphasized the unity or coherence of the parts of a form, but it began to be evident that the unity or coherence of a substance was a more basic fact. How do we see the singleness of a detached object? A single object has a topologically closed surface; it is a substance completely surrounded by the medium or, in mathematical terms, a surface that returns upon itself. The detached obiect can be moved without breaking its surface. Its substance is separated from adjacent substances by air. One object becomes two only when its substance has been ruptured. How do we see this unbroken connectedness?

The first experiment to suggest that this basic fact might be specified optic- ally was supposed to be an experiment on motion parallax and depth percep- tion but turned out to be an experiment on the perception of separation in depth(E. J. Gibson, Gibson, Smith, and Flock, 1959). The point-source shadow projector was set up to throw on the screen two random textures intermixed and filling the screen Actually, there were two transparent sheets of glass, each sprinkled with talcum powder. This kind of texture yields the perception of a surface but not one whose elements are geometrical forms. The phenomenal surface is coherent and continuous but without lines, contours, or definite spots. It looks like the surface of a plaster wall or a cloud.

The two shadow casters could be either motionless or moving. When they were both motionless or moving across the window at the same speed, only one virtual surface was perceived. But when there was a difference in speed between the two optical textures, a splitting of the surface in two, a separation in depth, resulted. The perception was of twoness instead of oneness but not of two forms. It was as if the formerly coherent surface had become layered. The striking fact 172 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

This is a view from above. The two textured sheets of glass are indicated by the parallel dashed lines. They move together on the same carriage, but their separation can be increased from zero. In a unit of time, the shadow at the center of one sheet sweeps through a certain angle, and the corresponding shadow on the other sheet sweeps through a different angle, as shown. The ratio of the lesser to the greater visual angle is the inverse of the ratio of the distances of their respective sheets from the point source.

was that although this separation was "in depth"the difference in depth was equivocal. The faster motion was not necessarily seen in front of the other, as the law of motion parallax would predict. The surface in front had to appear semitransparent, of course, but every now and then the front-back relation between the two surfaces would spontaneously be reversed.

Wherein lay the information for this splitting? One half of the interspersed elements of texture all moved with one velocity, and the other half all moved with another velocity. Hence, there was a permutation of the adjacent order of the texture elements. When some caught up with and passed others, the adjacent order was destroyed. The permutation was not complete, to be sure, for each set of elements preserved adjacent order, but the original connectivity had been destroyed. Hence, the phenomenal continuity of the original surface gave way to the perception of two continuous surfaces, the nearest being transparent (E. J. Gibson, Gibson, Smith, and Flock, 1959, pp. 45 ff.). Thus, the available information in an optic array for continuity could be described as the preserva- tion of adjacent order, which is to say, the absence of its permutation. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 173

A permutation of adjacent order is a more radical change than a transformation that leaves adjacent order invariant. A size transformation and the rigid trans- formation of foreshortening, as well as the nonrigid transformation of stretching, leave order invariant. A still more radical change than permutation is possible, however, and this was suggested by another experiment. It is a change that subtracts elements of the array on one side of a contour or adds them on. I have called this change progressive deletion or accretion of structure. But this belongs in the next chapter. Experiments on the Perception of Collision

In Chapter 6 the kind of mechanical event called a collision was described. In the simplest case, a collision may be one elastic object such as a billiard ball bumping another and causing it to move. Michotte (1963)used the disk-and-slot appar- atus to study the optical and temporal conditions for this perception. He found, contrary to the assertion of David Hume, that the actual "launching" of one object by another can be seen, not just the succession of two discrete motions. In other words, one gets a direct causal perception over and above the kinetic sensations when the time intervals fall within certain limits.

Michotte was concerned with the phenomenology of the causal impression. He did not consider the hypothesis that there could be a display of optical inform- ation for the perception of one object launching another. His results are consistent with that hypothesis, however. S. Runeson (1977) has based a series of experi- ments on it. He has studied the perception of two-body linear collisions that vary from elastic to damped. In a real collision, the relative velocity difference between the motions before and after contact is invariant and specifies the nature of the substances. This is what he varied. In his experiments, not only was the collision perceived as such, but the hardness or softness of the objects themselves were also. Yet, all the observer could ever"see"was a pair of moving patches on the screen of an oscilloscope.

Runeson had studied ecological dynamics. He had discovered an inform- ative invariant and had controlled it in his display. We shall begin to understand event perception if we follow this lead.

The Coperception of One's Own Movement

So far we have been considering the perception of motion in the world. We now come to the problem of the perceiver's awareness of his own motion in the world, that is, the awareness of locomotion.

The Discovery of Visual Kinesthesis

In the 1940s, great numbers of students were being trained to fly military airplanes, and considerable numbers were failing. It seemed sensible to try and 174 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

find out whether a student could see what was necessary in order to land a plane before taking him up and trying to teach him to land it without crashing. One thing he had to see was the aiming point of a landing glide, the direction in which he was going. A test was devised consisting of a series of motion picture shots with a camera dollying down toward a model runway (Gibson, 1947，Ch. 9). The testee had to say whether he was aiming at spot A, B, C, or D, all marked on the runway. This was a test of "landing judgment," and it was the beginning of an inquiry that went on for years.

It turns out that the aiming point of any locomotion is the center of the cent- rifugal flow of the ambient optic array. Whatever object or spot on the ground is specified at that null point is the object or spot you are approaching. This is an exact statement. But since I could not conceive of the ambient optic array in 1947, only the retinal image, I first tried to state the flow in terms of retinal motion and gradients of retinal velocity. Such a statement cannot be made exact and leads to contradictions. Not until later were the principles of the two foci of radial outflow and inflow in the whole array at a moving point of observation described precisely (Gibson, Olum, and Rosenblatt, 1955).

In the 1955 paper, the authors gave a mathematical description of "motion perspective"in the optic array, for any direction of locomotion relative to a flat earth. All optical flow vanishes at the horizon and also at the two centers that specify going toward and coming from. Motion perspective was much more than the cue"of motion parallax. As this had been formulated by Helmholtz, it was no more than a rule for "drawing conclusions" about the distance of an object, and in any case the rule did not hold for an object on the line of locomotion. Motion perspective did not refer to "apparent"motions of objects but referred to the layout of the earth. And it "told"the observer not only about the earth but also about himself, the fact of his locomotion and the direction of it. The focus of outflow (or the center of optical expansion) is not a sensory cue but an optical invariant, a nonchange in the midst of change. The focus is formless and is the same for any kind of structure, for grass, trees, a brick wall, or the surface of a cloud.

Student pilots see where they are going on the basis of this invariant and get better with practice. Drivers of cars see where they are going, if they pay atten- tion. Viewers of a Cinerama screen see where they are going in the represented environment. A bee that lands on a flower must see where it is going. And all of them at the same time see the layout of the environment through which they are going. This is a fact with extremely radical implications for psychology, for it is difficult to understand how a train of signals coming in over the optic nerve could explain it. How could signals have two meanings at once, a subjective meaning and an objective one? How could signals yield an experi- ence of self-movement and an experience of the external world at the same time? How could visual motion sensations get converted into a stationary environment and a moving self? The doctrine of the special senses and the theory of sensory channels come into question. A perceptual system must be at Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 175

work that extracts invariants. Exteroception and proprioception must be

complementary.

There are various ways of putting this discovery, although old words must

be used in new ways since age-old doctrines are being contradicted. I suggested

that vision is kinesthetic in that it registers movements of the body just as much

as does the muscle-joint-skin system and the inner ear system. Vision picks up

both movements of the whole body relative to the ground and movement of a

member of the body relative to the whole. Visual kinesthesis goes along with

muscular kinesthesis. The doctrine that vision is exteroceptive, that it obtains

"external"information only, is simply false. Vision obtains information about

both the environment and the self. In fact, all the senses do so when they are

considered as perceptual systems (Gibson, 1966b).

Vision, of course, is also statesthetic, if one wants to be precise about words, in that

it picks up nonmovement of the body and its members. But since nonmovement is

actually only a limiting case of movement, the term kinesthesis will do for both. The

point is that a flowing and an arrested optic array specify respectively an observer in

locomotion and an observer at rest, relative to a fixed environment. Motion and rest

are in fact what an observer experiences with flow and nonflow of the array.

Optical motion perspective is not the same as visual kinesthesis. Motion

perspective is an abstract way of describing the information in an ambient array

at a moving point of observation. If the information is picked up, both visual

layout perception and visual kinesthesis will occur. But motion perspective is

analyzed for an ambient array at an unoccupied point of observation. In visual

kinesthesis, on the other hand, the nose and the body are visible. There is

information for coperceiving the self as well as for perceiving the layout.

Another preliminary point should be made. It is most important not to

confuse visual kinesthesis with visual feedback, a term that has currency in

psychology and physiology today but is not very clear. The term is used with

reference to voluntary movement in connection with the control of purposive

action. If a movement is caused by a command in the brain, the efferent impulses

in motor nerves are followed by afferent impulses in sensory nerves that are

actually reafferent, that is, impulses that are fed back into the brain. Feedback,

therefore, comes with an active movement. But not all movements are active:

some are passive, as when a bird is moved in the wind or a person is moved in

a vehicle. Visual kinesthesis is the same for a passive as for an active movement,

but visual feedback is absent with a passive movement. The problem of the

information for a given movement should not be confounded with the additional

problem of the control of movement. Visual kinesthesis is important in the

control of locomotion but is not the same thing. It is true that we often need to

see how we have just moved in order to decide how to move next. But the first

question is, how do we see how we have just moved?

The current confusion between kinesthesis and feedback helps to explain

why visual kinesthesis is not recognized as a fact of psychology. But it is a fact, 176 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

shown by the following experiments on the inducing of the experience of passive movement.

Experiments with Visual Kinesthesis

Until recently, most of the evidence about induced ego movement had to come from motion pictures, or simulators for training, or amusement park devices. The flow of the optic array in a glide path can be represented, more or less, in a motion picture (Gibson, 1947, pp. 230 ff.); the observer will see himself moving down toward a pseudoairfield, however much he is still aware of being seated in a room and looking at a screen. With a Cinerama screen, the virtual window may sample as much as 160° of the ambient array, instead of the mere 20° or 30° of the usual movie theater, and the illusion of locomotion may then be compelling, uncomfortably so. Training devices with a panoramic curved screen of 200° from side to side have been used; for example, one such device simulates flight in a helicopter, and the experience of rising, flying, banking, and landing is so vivid that the illusion of reality is almost complete, although the observer's body is always anchored to the floor. Attempts have also been made to simulate automobile driving.

In the best of these displays, the laws of both natural angular perspective and motion perspective have been observed. The virtual world, the layout of earth and objects, appears to be stationary and rigid. Only the observer moves. But if the projection system or the lens system that creates the display is imperfect, stretching or rubbery motions of the layout will be seen. Then the nonrigid appearance of the environment is not only disconcerting but also often leads to nausea.

The laws of motion perspective for flight over the earth with its horizon can even be set into a computer, which then generates a display on a television screen that simulates any desired maneuver. But all these experiments, if they can be called that, have been done in the interests of the aviation industry rather than those of understanding perception, and the reports are found only in the technical engineering literature.

The reader may have observed that what is called a dolly shot in cinemato- graphy will give the viewer the experience of being a spectator following behind or moving ahead of a character who is walking along. The arrangement of the surfaces and other persons in the scene is more vividly given than it is in a stationary shot. The dolly shot is to be distinguished from the panning shot, where the viewer gets the experience not of locomotion but of turning the head while keeping the same point of observation.

The Gliding Room Experiment

Recently, a laboratory apparatus has been constructed for the stated purpose of investigating visual kinesthesis during locomotion and separating it from the Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 177 kinesthesis of the muscle-joint-skin system and the vestibular system (Lishman and Lee, 1973). The flow of the ambient array is produced by a moving enclosure, a room of sorts with walls and ceilings that can be made to glide over the real floor since it is hung by its corners from a great height barely above the Hoor. I am tempted to call it an invisibly moving room because, except for the floor, there is no information for the room's motion relative to the earth. It is a pseudoenvironment. If contact of the feet with the surface of support is obscured and if the floor is hidden, the illusion of being moved forward and backward in the room is compelling. This is accomplished by what Lishman and Lee call a trolley, in which the observer stands (cf. also Lee, 1974).

Rotations of the Body: Swinging, Tilting, Turning

Besides the linear locomotions of the body, there are the movements of rota- tion, which can occur on a lateral axis, a front-back axis, or a head-foot axis. The movement of a child in a swing has a component of rotation on a lateral axis, like a somersault. The movement of tilting sideways is a rotation on a front-back axis. The movement of being turned in a swivel chair or of turning the head is rotation on a head-foot axis. Pure visual kinesthesis of all these rota- tions can be induced with an invisibly moving room, that is, by putting the observer in an enclosure, supporting him on an inconspicuous surface attached to the earth, and then rotating the enclosure.

An amusement park device called the Haunted Swing used to be popular. A couple entered what appeared to be an ordinary room and were seated in a swing hanging from a bar running horizontally across the room. The room, not the seat, then began to swing on the shaft from which the seat was suspended. When the room eventually made a complete revolution, the occupants felt themselves go head over heels. What a sensation! It should be noted that the illusion vanished if the eyes were shut, as would be expected with visual kines- thesis. An account of the experience and the original reference are given by Gibson and Mowrer (1938).

An experimental room can be made to tilt on a front-back axis, with an observer in an upright seat. Tilting rooms of this sort have been built in labor- atories, and they produced a large literature some twenty years ago(for example, Witkin, 1949). As the room invisibly rotates. both one's body and the chair seem to rotate in the room. Some part of the experienced body tilt usually remains even after the room has become stationary. This latter fact, the feeling of one's posture as dependent on both the visual sense and the bodily senses, was what aroused the greatest interest of experimenters. The arguments in terms of sensations were inconclusive, however. For a discussion of the "phenomenal vertical"in terms of stimuli and cues, see Gibson (1952).

Finally, an experimental room can be made to rotate on a vertical axis. This is a common apparatus in many laboratories, going under the name of an optokinetic 178 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

drum. (See, for example, Smith and Bojar, 1938). It has usually been thought of as a device for studying the eye movements of animals instead of visual kinesthesis, but it can be adapted for the human observer. A textured enclosure, usually a vertically striped cylinder, is rotated around the animal, whose head-eye system then shows the same compensatory movements that it would if the animal were really being turned. Optically, although not inertially, it is being turned. Human subjects usually say that they feel themselves being turned. There must be a real surface of support, however, and, in my experiments, the illusion seemed to depend on not seeing it, or not paying attention to the floor under one's feet. You could anchor yourself to that, if you tried, and then you become aware of the hidden environment outside the room.

What is picked up in these three cases of swinging, tilting, and turning must be a relation between the ambient optic array specifying the world and the edges of the field of view specifying the self. As already suggested, the upper and lower edges of the field of view sweep over the ambient array in swinging; the field of view wheels over the array in tilting; and the lateral edges of the field sweep across the array in turning. These three kinds of information were described in Chapter 7.

It should be noted that, insofar as the three rotations of the body occur without locomotion through the environment, motion perspective does not arise and the ambient array does not flow. The information for the perception of layout is thus minimal.

To speak of the environment being rotated relative to the observer in these cases (instead of the body being rotated relative to the environment) would be simply nonsense. The environment, in the sense of the persisting environment, is that with reference to which objects move, animals move, and surfaces deform. There has to be an underlying nonchange if change is to be specified. The prin- ciple of the relativity of motion cannot be applied to rotation of the body.

Visual Kinesthesis of the Limbs and Hands

Chapter 7, on the optical information for perceiving one's body and its movements, contained a section on the limbs and hands. Certain shapes protrude into the field of view, or else the field sweeps down to reveal them. If they squirm restlessly and are five-pronged, they specify hands. Every manip- ulation is specified by a corresponding change in the five-pronged silhouette. Reaching, grasping, letting go, plucking, and twisting are controlled by the ongoing optical motions that specify them, as I shall emphasize in Chapter 13.

There are no experiments, however, on this kind of visual kinesthesis. Only so-called eye-hand coordination has been recognized, as if sensations from the eye and the hand had to be associated and that were the end of it. Experiments on the Perception of Motion in the World and Movement of the Self 179 Summary

Evidence for the direct perception of changing layout in the environment and evidence for the direct perception of the movement of the self relative to the environment have been summarized. The awareness of the world and the awareness of the self in the world seemed to be concurrent. Both event motion in the world and locomotion of the self can be given by vision, the former by a local change in the perspective structure and the latter by a global change of the perspective structure of the ambient optic array.

The visual perception of motion in general has been taken to depend on a set of discrete motions of stimuli over the retina. If this is so, an explanation is required of how they are made to cohere in the process of perception. Experiments on the "grouping" of spot motions are inspired by this requirement, as are theories of so-called kinetic depth. But if a change in the optic array is already coherent, its elements do not have to be made coherent.

Experiments with progressive magnification and experiments with progressive transformation suggested that a coherent change in the optic array could be picked up by the visual system. The first kind yielded a direct perception of an approaching object and the second kind that of a turning surface. The perception of these two events was vivid and precise. The imminence of collision and the angular degree of turning could be judged correctly.

The virtual object in these experiments did not change size or shape. It was rigid. The changing perspective shadows on the screen were not noticed.

The distinguishing of nonrigid motions such as stretching, bending, and twisting seems to be possible along with the perception of approaching and turning. The Uppsala experiments show this clearly.

The perception of the rupturing of a surface by separation in depth seems to be possible along with the perception of its displacement. This experiment suggests that the optical information for "surfaciness" is not just the proximity of the units in the array, as was implied in the last chapter, but is the nonper- mutation of the adjacent order of these persisting units over time.

Experiments on visual kinesthesis are even harder to set up in the laboratory than experiments on visual event perception. One needs a panoramic motion picture screen, or a pseudoenvironment like the invisibly moving room, to produce the full illusion of passive locomotion. And there is danger of falling into epistemological confusion about the real environment. But the evidence is enough to show that the theory of motion perspective in the ambient array applies to the awareness of locomotion.

Moreover, the awareness of swinging, tilting, and turning of the observer's body can be induced if an enclosure, a pseudoenvironment, is rotated around the observer on the appropriate axis. 

## 11. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and Its Implications for Perception

The facts of occlusion have been described in Chapter 5. They are part of ecological optics. But they were not recognized as facts until observations and experiments made them compelling. The experiments described in the last two chapters about surfaces, layout, change, and kinesthesis were radical enough, but they culminated in the most radical of all, in what I can only call the discovery of the occluding edge. This discovery is radical for the following reason. If it is true that there are places where opaque surfaces are seen one behind another, ifit is true that one can perceive a hidden surface, a paradox arises. For we are not now allowed to say that a hidden surface is perceived; we can only say that it is remembered. To be perceived, a thing must be "present to the senses"; it must be stimulating receptors. If it is not, it can only be experienced by means of an image; it can be recalled, imagined, conceived, or perhaps known, but not perceived. Such is the accepted doctrine, the theory of sensation-based percep- tion. If an occluded surface is perceived, the doctrine is upset.

Kaplan's Experiment

The crucial experiment, which was performed by G. A. Kaplan (1969)，involved kinetic, not static, displays of information. Each display was a motion picture shot of a random texture filling the screen, with a progressive deletion (or accre- tion)of the optical structure on one side of a contour and preservation of the structure on the other side. Photographs of a randomly textured paper were taken frame by frame, and successive frames were modified by careful paper- cutting. No contour was ever visible on any single frame, but progressive decre- ments of the texture were produced on one side of the invisible line by cutting off thin slices of paper in succession. Progressive increments of the texture could The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 181 be obtained by reversing the film. This particular kind of decrementing or incrementing of structure had not previously been achieved in a visual display.

In effect, a reversible disturbance of structure in a sample of the optic array had been isolated and controlled, a reversible transition. It is called a transition, not a transformation, since elements of structure were lost or gained and one- to-one correspondence was not preserved. What was perceived?

All observers, without exception, saw one surface going behind another (or coming from behind another) that was always concealing (or revealing) the first. Deletion always caused the perception of covering, and accretion always caused the perception of uncovering. The surface going out of sight was never seen to go out of existence, and the surface coming into sight was never seen to come into existence. In short, one surface was seen in a legitimate sense behind another at an occluding edge.

When the array was arrested by stopping the film, the edge perception ceased and a wholly continuous surface replaced it; when the optical transition was resumed, the edge perception began. The "motion"of the display as such, however, had nothing to do with the occluding edge; what counted was accre- tion or deletion and whether it was on one side or the other.

These results were striking. There were no uncertainties of judgment, no guessing as in the usual psychophysical experiment. What the observers saw was an edge, a cut edge, the edge of a sheet, and another surface behind it. But this depended on an array changing in time.

The surface that was being covered was seen to persist after being concealed, and the surface that was being uncovered was seen to pre-exist before being revealed. The hidden surface could not be described as remembered in one case or expected in the other. A better description would be that it was perceived retrospectively and prospectively. It is certainly reasonable to describe percep- tion as extending into the past and the future, but note that to do so violates the accepted doctrine that perception is confined to the present.

The crucial paper by Kaplan (1969) was published along with a motion picture film called The Change from Visible to Invisible: A Study of Optical Transitions Gibson, 1968)and an article having the same title by Gibson, Kaplan, Reynolds. and Wheeler (1969). A sharp distinction was made between going out of sight and going out of existence, and it was proposed that there is information to specify the two cases. I have described the information in Chapters 5 and 6. The former is a reversing transition, but the latter is not.

Anticipations of the Occluding Edge

The important result of Kaplan's experiment was not the perceiving of depth at the occluding edge but the perceiving of the persistence of the occluded surface. Depth perception requires no departure from traditional theories, but persistence perception is radically inconsistent with them. Only in the experimental work of 182 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Michotte had anything like persistence perception ever been hinted at (Michotte, Thinès, and Crabbé, 1964). He discovered what he called the "tunnel phenom- enon" or the "tunnel effect," the perception of a moving object during the interval between going into a tunnel and coming out of it. He ascribed it, however, not to progressive deletion and accretion of structure for going in and coming out but to a tendency for perception to be completed across a gap, in the style of gestalt theorizing. He did not realize how universal occlusion is during locomotion of the observer. But he was very much aware of the paradox of asserting that an object could be seen during an interval when there was no sensory basis for seeing it. The "screening"or "covering" of an object, he real- ized, was a fact of visual perception. But he could only suppose that the percep- tion of an object must somehow persist after the sensory input ends; he did not entertain the more radical hypothesis that the persistence of the object is perceived as a fact in its own right. There is a vast difference between the persistence of a percept and the perception of persistence.

It had long been recognized that in pictures, or other displays with a frozen array, the appearance of superposition could be obtained. Likewise, Rubin's discovery that a closed contour or figure in a display involved the appearance of a ground that seemed to extend without interruption behind the figure was well known. But these demonstrations were concerned with the seeing of contours and lines and the perceiving of forms, not with the perceiving of the occluding edges of surfaces in a cluttered terrestrial environment. They showed that what might be called depth-by-superposition could be induced by a picture but not that an occluded surface is seen to persist.

The occluding edge seems to have escaped notice in both physics and psychology. In truth, it is not a fact of physics or a fact of psychology as these disciplines have been taught. It depends on the combined facts of a surface layout and a point of observation.

The Theory of Reversible Occlusion

The theory of reversible occlusion was formulated in Chapter 5 in terms of what I called projected and unprojected surfaces for an ambient optic array at a given time. Reversible occlusion was said to be a consequence of the reversibility of locomotions and motions in the medium, and this was contrasted in Chapter 6 with the unreversibility of changes such as disintegration, dissolution, and the change from a solid to a liquid or a gas. These changes, I said, were not such that the waning of a surface was the temporal inverse of waxing, not such that if a film of one event were run backward it would represent the opposite event (Gibson and Kaushall, 1973).

Then, in Chapter 7 on the self, the principle of reversible occlusion was extended to the head turning of the observer, and the margins of the field of view were compared to the occluding edges of a window. The principle is The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 183 widely applicable. It would be useful to bring together all this theorizing and to summarize it in a list of propositions.

Terminology

The reader should be reminded again that many pairs of terms can be used to denote what I have called occlusion. In what follows, the words hidden and unhidden are chosen to have a general meaning (although they have the unwanted flavor of buried treasure!). Unprojected and projected, the terms used in Chapter 5, are all right except for the implication of throwing an image on a screen, which gives precisely the wrong emphasis. Covered and uncovered are possible terms, or screened and unscreened, and these were employed by Michotte. Other possibilities are concealed and revealed, or undisclosed and disclosed. All these terms refer to various kinds of occlusion. The most general terms are out of sight and in sight, which contrast with out of existence and in existence. It should be kept in mind that all these terms refer to reversible transitions, that is, to becoming hidden or unhidden, to going out of sight or coming into sight. Terms that should not be employed are disappear and appear. Although in common use, these words are ambiguous and promote sloppy thinking about the psychology of percep- tion. The same is true of the words visible and invisible.

There seem to be a number of different ways of going out of sight, some not by occlusion and some by occlusion. The latter always involves an occluding edge with progressive deletion on one side of a contour, but the former does not. I can think of three kinds of going out of sight not by occlusion: first, going into the distance by minification of the solid angle to a so-called vanishing point in the sky or on the horizon; second, going out of sight in "the dark"by reduc- tion of illumination; and third, going out of sight by closure or covering of the eyes. Perhaps going out of sight in fog or mist is another kind, but it is similar to loss of structure by darkness (Chapter 4). I can also think of three kinds of occlusion other than self-occlusion (Chapter 5): first, at the edge of an opaque covering surface; second, at the edge of the field of view of an observer: and third, for celestial bodies, at the horizon of the earth. As for the going out of existence of a surface, there seem to be many kinds of destruction, so many that only a list of examples could be given in Chapter 6 on ecological events.

Locomotion in a Cluttered Environment

The following seven statements about reversible occlusion are taken from Chapters 1 to 5.

1. The substances of the environment differ in the degree to which they persist, some resisting dissolution, disintegration, or vaporization more than others. 184 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

2. The surfaces of the environment, similarly, differ in the degree to which they persist, some being transitory and others being relatively permanent. A surface goes out of existence when its substance dissolves, disintegrates, or evaporates.

3. Given an illuminated medium, a surface is unhidden at a fixed point of observation if it has a visual solid angle in the ambient optic array at that point. If it does not (but has at another point of observation), it is hidden.

4. For any fixed point of observation, the persisting layout of the environ- ment is divided into hidden and unhidden surfaces. Conversely, for every persisting surface, the possible points of observation are divided into those at which it is hidden and those at which it is not.

5. A surface that has no visual solid angle at any point of observation is neither hidden nor unhidden. It is out of existence, not out of sight.

6. Any movement of a point of observation that hides previously unhidden surfaces has an opposite movement that reveals them. Thus, the hidden and the unhidden interchange. This is the law of reversible occlusion for locomotion in a cluttered habitat. It implies that after a sufficient sequence of reversible loco- motions all surfaces will have been both hidden and unhidden.

7. The loci of occlusion are those places at which the hidden and unhidden surfaces into which a layout is temporarily divided are separated at occluding edges, there being two sorts, apical and curved. They are also the places where the hidden and unhidden surfaces are joined at occluding edges. Thus, to perceive an occluding edge of an object, even a fixed occluding edge at a fixed point of observation, is to perceive both the separation and the junction of its far and near surfaces.

The Motions of Detached Objects

Three more statements about reversible occlusion follow; they are taken from Chapter 5.

8. For any opaque object, the near surface, the temporary "front,"hides the far surface, the temporary "back," at a fixed point of observation. The two interchange, however, when the object is rotated. The near surface also hides the background of the object, if present, but when the object is displaced the parts that go behind at one edge come from behind at the other. These facts can be observed in the film entitled The Change from Visible to Invisible: A Study of Optical Transitions (Gibson, 1968).

9. For both solidity and superposition, any motion of an object that conceals a surface has a reverse motion that reveals it.

10. To the extent that the objects of the environment have moved or been moved, the near and far sides of every object will have interchanged many times. This holds true over and above the extent to which the observer has moved around. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 185 Head Turning

Following is the theorem about reversible occlusion when the observer looks around by turning her head. It is now assumed that the point of observation is occupied (Chapter 7).

11. For any fixed posture of the head, surfaces of the surrounding layout are divided into those inside the boundaries of the field of view and those outside the boundaries of the field. But with every turn of the head surfaces come into sight at the leading edge of the field of view and go out of sight at the trailing edge. The observer who looks around can thus see undivided surround- ings and see herself in the middle of them.

Nonpersisting Surfaces

The next theorem is about the unreversing destruction and creation of surfaces and the unreversing optical transitions that accompany them (Chapter 6).

12. The going out of existence of a surface is not the reverse of its coming into existence, nor is the disturbance of optical structure that specifies one the reverse of the disturbance of structure that specifies the other. Hence, the disap- pearance of a surface by, say, dissolution can be distinguished from its disap- pearance by occlusion if the observer has learned to see the difference between the optical transitions. Such evidence as there is suggests that the two kinds of disappearance are usually distinguished (Gibson, Kaplan, Reynolds, and Wheeler, 1969). This is not to say that infants notice the difference, or even that adults always notice the difference. The difference may sometimes be hard to notice, as when a conjurer is playing tricks with one's perception. It is only to say that anyone can learn to see the difference.

The occlusion of a surface can be nullified, whereas the destruction of a surface cannot. Occlusion can be canceled by a movement of the body, head, or limbs in the opposite direction. Destruction, although it can sometimes be remedied, cannot simply be canceled by an opposite movement. It seems to me that young children must notice the optical transitions that can be thus nullified and those that cannot. How could they fail to pay attention to them? They play peek-a-boo, turn their heads, and watch their hands, all cases of reversible occlusion, and they also spill the milk, break the glass, and knock down the tower of blocks, things that cannot be reversed. But this hypothesis has not been tested with babies, because the only experiments carried out are in the spirit of rationalism promoted by J. Piaget, which asserts that children must form a concept of persistence or permanence and emphasizes what the children believe instead of what they see (for example, Bower, 1974, Ch. 7). 186 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

What is Seen at this Moment from this Position does not

Comprise What is Seen

The old approach to perception took the central problem to be how one could see into the distance and never asked how one could see into the past and the future. These were not problems for perception. The past was remembered, and the future was imagined. Perception was of the present. But this theory has never worked. No one could decide how long the present lasted, or what distin- guished memory from imagination, or when percepts began to be stored, or which got stored, or any other question to which this doctrine led. The new approach to perception, admitting the coperception of the self to equal status with the perception of the environment, suggests that the latter is timeless and that present-past-future distinctions are relevant only to the awareness of the self.

The environment seen-at-this-moment does not constitute the environ- ment that is seen. Neither does the environment seen-from-this-point consti- tute the environment that is seen. The seen-now and the seen-from-here specify the self, not the environment. Consider them separately.

What is seen now is a very restricted sample of the surfaces of the world, limited to those that are inside the boundaries of the field of view at this head- posture. It is even limited to that surface being fixated at this eye-posture, if by seen one means clearly seen. This is at most less than half of the world and perhaps only a detail of that.

What is seen from here is at most the optically uncovered surfaces of the world at this point of observation, that is, the near sides of objects, the unhidden portions of the ground, the walls, and the bits that project through windows and doors.

The fact is that, although one can become aware of the seen-now and the seen-from-here if one takes the attitude of introspection, what one perceives is an environment that surrounds one, that is everywhere equally clear, that is in-the-round or solid, and that is all-of-a-piece. This is the experience of what I once called the visual world (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 3). It has vistas that are connected and places that adjoin, with a continuous ground beneath every- thing, below the clutter, receding into the distance, out to the horizon.

The surface being fixated now at this momentary eye-posture is not a depth- less patch of color, and the surfaces inside the field of view seen now at this head-posture are not a depthless patchwork of colors, for they have the quality that I called slant in the last chapter. The seen-at-this-moment is not the same. therefore, as the supposedly flat visual field analogous to the colors laid on a canvas by a painter that the old theory of color sensations asserted. I once believed that you could with training come to see the world as a picture, or almost do so, but I now have doubts about it. That comes close to saying that you can almost see your retinal image, which is a ridiculous assertion. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 187 FIGURE 11.1 The surfaces viewed now from here by an observer seated in a room. At this temporary eye posture and this temporary head posture, the surfaces projected into the retinal image are indicated by solid lines and the remaining surfaces by dashed lines. The awareness of the here-and-now surfaces might be called viewing the room as distinguished from seeing the room. This is a vertical section of the observer and his monocular field of view.

The seen-from-here, from this stationary point of observation, is also not the supposedly flat visual field of tradition, for it is ambient. But it might justly be called viewing the world in perspective, or noticing the perspectives of things. This means the natural perspective of ancient optics, not the artificial perspective of the Renaissance; it refers to the set of surfaces that create visual solid angles in a frozen ambient optic array. This is a very small sample of the whole world, however, and what we perceive is the world.

Perception Over Time from Paths of Observation

It is obvious that a motionless observer can see the world from a single fixed point of observation and can thus notice the perspectives of things. It is not so obvious but it is true that an observer who is moving about sees the world at no point of observation and thus, strictly speaking, cannot notice the perspectives of things. The implications are radical. Seeing the world at a traveling point of observation, over a long enough time for a sufficiently extended set of paths, 188 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

begins to be perceiving the world at all points of observation, as if one could be everywhere at once. To be everywhere at once with nothing hidden is to be all-seeing, like God. Each object is seen from all sides, and each place is seen as connected to its neighbor. The world is not viewed in perspective. The under- lying invariant structure has emerged from the changing perspective structure, as I put it in Chapter 5.

Animals and people do in fact see the environment during locomotion, not just in the pauses between movements. They probably see better when moving than when stationary. The arrested image is only necessary for a photographic camera. An observer who is getting around in the course of daily life sees from what I will call a path of observation. A path does not have to be treated as an infinite set of adjacent points at an infinite set of successive instants; it can be thought of as a unitary movement, an excursion, a trip, or a voyage. A path of observation is the normal case, short paths for short periods of observation and long paths for hours, days, and years of observation. The medium can be thought of as composed not so much of points as of paths.

It sounds very strange to say that one can perceive an object or a whole habitat at no fixed point of observation, for it contradicts the picture theory of perception and the retinal image doctrine on which it is based. But it has to be true if it is acknowledged that one can perceive the environment during locomotion. The perception of the environment is understood to accompany the visual proprio- ception of the locomotion, of course, and the hypothesis of invariant structure underlying the changing perspective structure is required for this to be intelli- gible. These are unfamiliar notions. But the notion of ambulatory vision is not more difficult, surely, than the notion of successive snapshots of the flowing optic array taken by the eye and shown in the dark projection room of the skull. The Problem of Orientation

Animals and humans are capable of being oriented to the habitat. This state is the opposite of being disoriented or "lost." The rat who can find its way directly to the goal box of a maze is said to be oriented to the goal. If there are many paths to the goal, the animal is capable of taking the shortest path. A person, similarly, can learn the way to work, to the post office, to the grocery store, and back home again through the passageways of his town. When he can do so in an unfa- miliar town, he has become oriented in the new habitat. Both animals and humans are capable of homing. More generally, they are capable of way-finding. Or, in still other terms, they can do place-learning. Observers can go to the places in their environment that have affordances for them. If they are human observers, moreover, they may be able to point to these places, that is, to indicate their direction from here through the walls or other surfaces that hide them.

Two current explanations of how animals learn to find their way to hidden places are the theory of response chains and the theory of cognitive maps. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 189 Neither is adequate. Way-finding is surely not a sequence of turning responses conditioned to stimuli. But neither is it the consulting of an internal map of the maze, for who is the internal perceiver to look at the map? The theory of reversible occlusion can provide a better explanation.

An alley in a maze, a room in a house, a street in a town, and a valley in a countryside each constitutes a place, and a place often constitutes a vista(Gibson, 1966b, p. 206)，a semienclosure, a set of unhidden surfaces. A vista is what is seen from here, with the proviso that "here" is not a point but an extended region. Vistas are serially connected since at the end of an alley the next alley opens up; at the edge of the doorway the next room opens up; at the corner of the street the next street opens up; at the brow of the hill the next valley opens up. To go from one place to another involves the opening up of the vista ahead and closing in of the vista behind. A maze or a cluttered environment provides a choice of vistas. And thus, to find the way to a hidden place, one needs to see which vista has to be opened up next, or which occluding edge hides the goal. One vista leads to another in a continuous set of reversible transitions. Note that in a terrestrial environment of semienclosed places each vista is unique, unlike the featureless passageways of a maze. Each vista is thus its own "land- mark"inasmuch as the habitat never duplicates itself.

When the vistas have been put in order by exploratory locomotion, the invariant structure of the house, the town, or the whole habitat will be appre- hended. The hidden and the unhidden become one environment. One can then perceive the ground below the clutter out to the horizon, and at the same time perceive the clutter. One is oriented to the environment. It is not so much having a bird's-eye view of the terrain as it is being everywhere at once. The getting of a bird's-eye view is helpful in becoming oriented, and the explorer will look down from a high place if possible. Homing pigeons are better at orientation than we are. But orientation to goals behind the walls, beyond the trees, and over the hill is not just a looking-down-on, and it is certainly not the having of a map, not even a "cognitive"map supposed to exist in the mind instead of on paper. A map is a useful artifact when the hiker is lost, but it is a mistake to confuse the artifact with the psychological state the artifact promotes.

Note that the perception of places and the perception of detached objects are quite different. Places cannot be displaced, whereas objects can be, and animate objects displace themselves. Places merge into adjacent places, whereas objects have boundaries. Orientation to hidden places with their attached objects can be learned once and for all, whereas orientation to movable objects has to be relearned continually. I know where the kitchen sink is. I think I know where the ski boots are stored, but I don't always know where my child is. One can only go to the last known locus of a detached object. Hidden objects can be moved without that event being perceived, and the unhappy state of the man whose car keys are seldom where he left them is notorious. 190 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 11.2 The opening up of a vista at an occluding edge, as seen from above.

This is a plan view of a passageway that opens on a courtyard from which another passageway leads. As an observer moves along the corridor, the surfaces behind his head progressively go out of sight, and surfaces in front progessively come into sight at one occluding edge and then the other. The hidden portions of the ground are indicated by hatching. The hidden portions of the walls are indicated by dashed lines. The position of the observer is indicated by a black dot.

In the pages above I have formulated a theory of orientation to the places of the habitat. The perceiving of the world entails the coperceiving of where one is in the world and of being in the world at that place. This is a neglected fact that is neither subjective nor objective. To the extent that one has moved from place to place, from vista to vista, one can stand still in one place and see where one is, which means where one is relative to where one might be. One does not need a map with a circle on it labeled, "You are here." I suggest that this consti- tutes the state of being oriented.

The Problem of Public Knowledge

The hypothesis of reversible optical transformations and occlusions resolves the puzzle of how, although the perspective appearances of the world are different for different observers, they nevertheless perceive the same world. Perspective appearances are not the necessary basis of perception.

It is true that there is a different optic array for each point of observation and that different observers must occupy different points at any one time. But The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 191 observers move, and the same path may be traveled by any observer. If a set of observers move around, the same invariants under optical transformations and occlusions will be available to all. To the extent that the invariants are detected, all observers will perceive the same world. Each will also be aware that his or her place in the world is different here and now from that of any other.

Points, of course, are geometrical concepts, whereas places are ecological layouts, but the above theory can also be put geometrically: although at a given instant some points of observation are occupied and the remainder unoccupied, the one set can go into the other.

The theory asserts that an observer can perceive the persisting layout from other places than the one occupied at rest. This means that the layout can be perceived from the position of another observer. The common assertion, then. that "I can put myself in your position" has meaning in ecological optics and is not a mere figure of speech. To adopt the point of view of another person is not an advanced achievement of conceptual thought. It means, I can perceive surfaces hidden at my point of view but unhidden at yours. This means, I can perceive a surface that is behind another. And if so, we can both perceive the same world.

The Puzzle of Egocentric Awareness

Psychologists often talk about egocentric perception. An egocentric perceiver is supposed to be one who can see the world only from his own point of view, and this habit is sometimes thought to characterize an egocentric person. Egoism is thought to come naturally to humans because they are innately aware of their private experiences and do not easily learn to adopt the point of view of others. This line of thinking now seems mistaken. Perception and proprioception are not alternatives or opposing tendencies of experience but complementary experiences.

The sensation-based theories of perception assume that the perspective appearances of the world are all that a newborn infant is given. They are the data for perception. Hence, the young child is necessarily egocentric, and cognitive development is a matter of progressing from subjective sensations to objective perceptions. The child's ego encompasses the world, and at the same time she is supposed to be confined to the awareness of her fleeting sensations. But there is a reason to be suspicious of all these speculations. The evidence about the earliest visual experiences of infants does not suggest that they are confined to surfaces seen-now-from-here, and the evidence definitely contradicts the doctrine that what they see is a flat patchwork of color sensations. I therefore suspect that the supposed egocentricity of the young child is a myth.

Hiding, Peeking, and Privacy

In Chapter 8 on affordances, I described how some of the places of an environ- ment are hiding places. That is, they afford the hiding of oneself or of one's 192 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

property from the sight of other observers. The phenomenon of seeing without being seen illustrates the application of optical occlusion to social psychology. The passage on hiding places in Chapter 8 should be reread.

The perceiving of occluded places and objects does occur and can be shared with other perceivers. To this extent, we all perceive the same world. But there is also ignorance of occluded things, and if you hide from me your private property, your hideaway in the hills, your secret lover, or the birthmark on your buttocks, then you and I do not perceive quite the same world. Public knowledge is possible, but so is its reciprocal, private knowledge.

Not only do babies like to play peek-a-boo and children to play hide-and- seek, but animals who are preyed upon hide from the predator, and the pred- ator may hide from the prey in ambush. One observer often wants to spy upon others, to see without being seen. He peers through a peephole or peeks around the occluding edge of a corner. In opposition to this is the striving not to be seen by others, the need for privacy. Burrows, caves, huts, and houses afford not only shelter from wind, cold, and rain but also the state of being out of sight, or out of the "public eye."

The human habit of covering the body with clothing whenever one is in sight of others is a matter of hiding some skin surfaces but not others, depending on the conventions of the culture. To display the usually covered surfaces is improper or immodest. The providing of some information for the layout of these hidden surfaces, however, is the aim of skillful clothing designers. And the careful manipulation of the occluding edges of clothing with progressive revealing of skin is a form of the theatrical art called stripping.

Summary

The demonstration that reversible occlusion is a fact of visual perception has far-reaching implications. It implies that an occluding edge is seen as such, that the persistence of a hidden surface is seen, and that the connection of the hidden with the unhidden is perceived. This awareness of what-is-behind, and of the togetherness of the far side and the near side of any object, puts many of the problems of psychology in a new light.

The doctrine that all awareness is memory except that of the present moment of time must be abandoned. So must the theory of depth perception. The importance of the fixed point of view in vision is reduced. But a new theory of orientation, of way-finding, and of place-learning in the environment becomes possible. And the puzzles of public knowledge, of egocentricity, and of privacy begin to be intelligible. 

## 12. Looking with the Head and Eyes

We modern, civilized, indoors adults are so accustomed to looking at a page or a picture, or through a window, that we often lose the feeling of being surrounded by the environment, our sense of the ambient array of light. Even when outdoors under the sky, one is apt to be driving an automobile and looking only through the windshield, or traveling in a vehicle where the window to the outside world is constricted to a small angle. We do not look around.

We live boxed-up lives. Our ancestors were always looking around. They surveyed the environment, for they needed to know where they were and what there was in all directions. Children pay attention to their surroundings when allowed to do so. Animals must do so. But we adults spend most of our time looking at instead of looking around. In order to look around, of course, one must turn one's head.

Looking Around and Looking At

The reason why humans must turn their heads in order to look around is that their eyes are set in the front of their heads instead of on either side, as they are in horses or rabbits. The orbits in the human skull are frontal, not lateral. The horse can see most of its surroundings (but not all) without having to turn its head; it can see around fairly well without having to look around. Thus, an enemy can sneak up on a person from behind, sometimes, but the hunter cannot sneak up on a rabbit. It has been suggested that animals who are preyed upon need a more panoramic field of view, whereas predatory animals such as cats can afford to have eyes in the front of the head (Walls, 1942). It has also been argued that the frontal eyes of primates living in the trees afford better "depth perception,"but this argument presupposes the entrenched fallacy of depth 194 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

perception that this book has been at such pains to destroy. Even if depth were perceived, it would be another error to assume that the only kind of depth perception is"binocular," that is, the kind that rests on binocular disparity.

With lateral eyes, the blind region behind the animal is minimal, but the overlap of the fields of view ahead of the animal is sacrificed. With frontal eyes. the overlap of the fields of view ahead is maximal, but the scope of the field of view is sacrificed and the blind region is large. Complete simultaneous ambi- ence of perception is impossible. There has to be some gap in the combined field of view simply because the body of the animal itself is there, that is, its body is bound to hide some of the surfaces of the surrounding environment. Simultaneous ambience of perception is unnecessary in any case if the animal can always turn its head. There is no need to perceive everything at once if everything can be perceived in succession.

The gap in the combined field of view of the eyes is that portion of the ambient optic array filled by the head and body of the observer himself. It is a visual solid angle with a closed envelope, a closed boundary in the array that specifies the body. It has a meaning, and it carries information. I have already made this point at some length in Chapter 7 on the self. The portion of the environmental layout that is hidden by the body is continually interchanging with the unhidden remainder as the head turns and the body moves.

The difference between the way a horse perceives its environment and the way a human does is therefore not so profound as you might assume. The blind region caused by the head and body of the horse is a small part of the ambient array, whereas the blind region caused by the head of a human is a large part, in fact, a visual solid angle of about 180°, approximating a hemisphere of the array But it is not actually a blind region, of course; it is the head. A small turn of the head enables the horse to see what is behind, and a large turn of the head enables a person to see what is behind, but in both cases the observer sees himself in the middle of an environment. Are you doubtful that a horse can see itself? Why shouldn't the horse see itself just as much as the human does, if vision yields proprioception as well as exteroception? The horse's blind area is differently shaped than the human's-the boundaries of its field of view are different-but the blind area means the same thing to the horse as it does to the human. Egoreception and exteroception are inseparable kinds of experience. The seeing of oneself is not a complex intellectual experience but a simple primitive one. The orthodox dogma that no animal but the human animal has self-consciousness is surely false.

With What Does One See the World?

We human observers take it for granted that one sees the environment with one's eyes. The eyes are the organs of vision just as the ears are the organs of hearing, the nose is the organ of smelling, the mouth is the organ of tasting, and Looking with the Head and Eyes 195

the skin is the organ of touching. The eye is considered to be an instrument of the mind, or an organ of the brain. But the truth is that each eye is positioned in a head that is in turn positioned on a trunk that is positioned on legs that maintain the posture of the trunk, head, and eyes relative to the surface of support. Vision is a whole perceptual system, not a channel of sense (Gibson, 19666). One sees the environment not with the eyes but with the eyes-in-the- head-on-the-body-resting-on-the-ground. Vision does not have a seat in the body in the way that the mind has been thought to be seated in the brain.The perceptual capacities of the organism do not lie in discrete anatomical parts of the body but lie in systems with nested functions.

Even so, it might be argued, one surely looks with the eyes even if one does not see with the eyes. But looking with the eyes alone is mere looking at, not looking around. It is the scanning of an object, a page of print, or a picture. One also looks with the head, not just with the eyes, more exactly with the head-eye system, as I said at the outset.

The exclusive concern with eye turning to the neglect of head turning is one of the deep errors of the snapshot theory of vision and goes back at least a century. Helmholtz asserted in Physiological Optics that"the intent of vision is to see as distinctly as possible various objects or parts of an object in succession. This is accomplished by so pointing the eyes that an image of the given object is projected on the fovea of each retina. The governing of the ocular move- ments is wholly subordinated to this end; both eyes are adjusted and accom- modated together so as to permit this light absorptive pointing. Any...eye 196 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

movement not having for its end the attaining of distinct imaging of an object cannot be performed"(Helmholtz, trans. 1925，p. 56). He assumed that objects and parts of objects are what we perceive and that these are limited to obiects in the fixed field of view. He would be astonished at the assertion that a man perceives his surroundings, including the environment behind his head, for that is not "the intent of vision."

The Awareness of the Environment and the Ego

Despite what Helmholtz said, some psychologists have insisted that a man is aware of the environment behind his head. Koffka was one who did so. Phenomenal space, he said, extends to the sides; yonder is the wall of the room and there are walls to the right and left, but phenomenal space also extends behind. You would be vividly aware of the space behind if the edge of a cliff were there. "Behavioral space does not confront me but encloses me." What is it that lies between the "in front" and the "behind"? It is, he says, "just that phenom- enal object we call the Ego." It is a segregated object, like others in phenomenal space (Koffka, 1935, p. 322). It is only a step from this description to the theory that the head and body of the observer hide the surfaces of the world that are outside the occluding edges of the field of view. Koffka made no reference to head turning and failed to recognize the interchange of the hidden and the unhidden, and that is an important step, but he did recognize a fact of perception.

When I distinguished, years ago, between the visual field as one kind of experience and the visual world as a radically different kind (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 3), I was elaborating on Koffka. The visual field, I suggested, consists of a patchwork of colors something like a picture, whereas the visual world consists of familiar surfaces and obiects one behind another. The visual field has bound- aries, roughly oval in shape, and it extends about 180 from side to side and about 140° up and down. The boundaries are not sharp, but they are easily observed when attended to. The visual world, however, has no such boundaries; it is unbounded, like the surface of a sphere extending all the way around me. The visual field is clear in the center and vague in the periphery-that is, less definite toward the boundaries-but the visual world has no such center of definition and is everywhere clear. The oval boundaries of the visual field sweep across the array whenever I turn my head and wheel over the array whenever I tilt my head, but the visual world is perfectly stationary and always upright. The patchwork of the visual field deforms as I move and, in particular, Hows outward from a center when I move in the direction of that center. but the phenomenal surfaces of the world are always perfectly rigid.

The visual field is a special kind of experience that can arise from a sample of the ambient array taken with the head and eyes fixed. In its purest form, the visual field arises with a single fixed eye. The visual world is the kind of exper- ience that arises naturally from the whole ambient array when one is looking Looking with the Head and Eyes 197

around and looking with two eyes at two slightly different points of observa- tion. The field of view of the two eyes is a sort of mixed cross-section of the overlapping solid angles registered by the eyes. The field of one eye would correspond to a plane picture cutting the solid angle for that eye. It would correspond in the sense that a faithful picture could be substituted for the angular sample so as to yield almost the same phenomenal experience. But the visual world is a kind of experience that does not correspond to anything, not any possible picture, not any motion picture, and not even any "panoramic"motion picture. The visual world is not a projection of the ecological world. How could it be? The visual world is the outcome of the picking up of invariant informa- tion in an ambient optic array by an exploring visual system, and the awareness of the observer's own body in the world is a part of the experience.

The awareness of "out there" and of "here" are complementary. The occluding boundary of the field of view constitutes "here." The content and details of the field of view are "out there,"and the smaller the detail the farther away it is.

The Visual Ego

Ecological optics distinguishes between an unoccupied point of observation in the medium and an occupied point (Chapter 7). The former is a position where an observer might be situated and the latter is a position where an observer is situated. The ambient optic array is then altered, for it includes a solid angle filled by the observer, having a boundary that is unique to the observer's partic- ular anatomy. It is called the blind region in physiological optics. But it is blind only for exteroception, not for proprioception. It looks like oneself. Its shape depends on the shape of one's nose, the shape of one's head, and the shape of one's limbs. It is altered when a person puts on eyeglasses or when a horse is made to wear blinders. Thus, whenever a point of observation is occupied, the occupier is uniquely specified, whether adult or child, monkey or dog.

TERMINOLOGICAL NOTE

I should never have entitled my 1950 book The Perception of the Visual World,

for it has promoted confusion. A better title would have been The Visual

Perception of the World. The term visual world should be reserved for the

awareness of the environment obtained by vision.

An observer perceives the position of here relative to the environment and also his body as being here. His limbs protrude into the field of view, and even his nose is a sort of protuberance into the field. Undoubtedly, the length of a 198 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

man's nose determines how he sees himself. (Consider the ego of a baboon in this respect, and think what the ego of an elephant would be!) For us, the nose is the leftward edge of the right eye's field of view and the rightward edge of the left eye's field of view. Hence, it yields a kind of subjective sensation called a double image in the theory of binocular vision, in fact, the maximum limit of crossed diplopia. It would therefore be a theoretical zero for the dimension of distance from here.

Since the occupied point of observation is normally a moving position, not a stationary one, the animal sees its body moving relative to the ground. It sees that part of the environment toward which it is moving; it sees the movements of its feet, relative to its body and also over the ground. When it looks around during locomotion, it sees the turning of its head. These are all cases of visual kinesthesis.

The Persisting Environment: Persistence, Coexistence,

and Concurrence

To say that one is aware of the environment behind one's head is to say that one is aware of the persistence of the environment. Things go out of sight and come into sight as the head turns in looking around, but they persist while out of sight. Whatever leaves the field as one turns to the right re-enters the field as one turns to the left. The structure that is deleted is later accreted; this is a reversible transition, and therefore the structure can be said to be invariant under the transition. To pick up the invariant is to perceive the persistence of a surface, so my argument runs. If this is true, there is no need to appeal to a concept of "object permanence" or to any theory of how the concept might develop.

THE INFORMATION FOR PERSISTENCE

The perceiving of the persistence of the environment is not, of course, an

achievement of the visual system alone. It is a nonmodal form of perception,

cutting across the perceptual systems and transcending the "senses."Touching

and listening accompany looking. The young child who goes for a walk and

looks around at the strange wide world can cling to the mother's hand,

confirming her persistence while she is temporarily out of sight. Similarly, the

persistence of the mother when she goes around the corner, or goes out of

sight in the dark, is confirmed by hearing her voice. The information to specify

the continued existence of something may be carried by touch or sound as

well as by light. Incessant stimulation is not necessary for the perceiving of

persistence. Looking with the Head and Eyes 199

To perceive the persistence of surfaces that are out of sight is also to perceive their coexistence with those that are in sight. In short, the hidden is continuous with the unhidden; they are connected.

Separated places and objects are perceived to coexist. This means that separ- ated events at these places are perceived to be concurrent. What happens at one end of a corridor is seen to co-occur with what happens at the other end, even though one must look back and forth between the two. Different concurrent events, thus, can be sampled in succession without destroying their concur- rence, just as different coexisting places can be sampled in succession without destroying their coexistence.

How Does the Eye-Head System Work? Outline of a New Theory Looking-around and looking-at are acts that naturally go together, but they can be studied separately. In fact, looking-at has been studied almost exclusively by visual physiologists. What they have recorded and measured are so-called eye movements, that is, movements of the eyes relative to the head. The head is usually fixed in an apparatus. The eyes are then allowed to scan a display of some sort within the field of view of the stationary head, a pattern of luminous points in the dark, or a line of print on a page, or a picture. The eyes rotate in rapid jumps from one fixation to another, and these are called saccadic movements. In terms of the retinal image theory, the fovea of each retina is moved so that an image of the particular "object of interest" falls on the retinal point of highest acuity where the photoreceptors, the cones, are most densely packed together. The anatomical fovea corresponds to the psychological "center of clearest vision." The fine details of the optical image are said to be best "resolved"at the fovea. All this is implied in the quotation from Helmholtz, above.

The Recognized Types of Eye Movement

There are other kinds of ocular movements besides scanning, however, and the accepted classification goes back to R. Dodge (1903), who was the first invest- igator to record and measure them by photography. They have since been studied with ever-increasing ingenuity and precision, but Dodge's list has never been challenged by physiologists. He never doubted the eye-camera analogy; he only forced us to consider that the eyes were movable cameras at the ends of fHlexible cables leading to the brain. The list is approximately as given below.

1. Fixation: Not strictly a"movement,"fixation is nevertheless an important kind of ocular behavior. It should be called a posture of the eye, a pointing at.

2. Saccadic movement: A saccadic movement is a rapid rotation of the eyeball from one fixation to another. It has long been taken for granted that the move- ment is a response of the eye muscles to a stimulus at the periphery of the retina 200 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

such as to bring that stimulus to the center of the retina, the fovea. But I shall challenge this assumption.

3. Pursuit movement: This kind of movement is said to be fixation of the eye on a moving object in the world, often nowadays called tracking. It is much slower than a saccadic movement.

4. Convergence and divergence: Convergence is the inward rotation of each eye so as to permit both eyes to fixate on the same near object. Divergence is the opposite, a return of the ocular axes to parallel so as to permit both eyes to fixate on the same distant object. In retinal image optics, it is assumed that these movements occur so that the two similar but more or less disparate images of the object can be "fused" in the brain to yield a single phenomenal object with depth. They are said to be governed by what is called a fusion reflex, but this is not consistent with the notion of a reflex as a response to a stimulus. Note that in both saccadic and pursuit movements the two eyes fixate together and rotate together as if they were linked. They are said to be conjugated. But they rotate in opposite directions during the vergence movements. All three types of movement, however, can be said to work in the interest of fixation.

5. Compensatory movement: This movement is quite different from the others. Like them, it is a rotation of each eye in the head but in precisely the opposite direction from that of the head, and to exactly the same degree. It compensates for the turning of the head. Thus, it is a nonmotion of the eyes relative to the environ- ment, a posture, like fixation. Anyone can note how exact this compensation normally is by looking at one eye in his mirror image and then moving his head around, left and right, up and down; the eye never swerves from its fixed orient- ation in space. It is as if anchored to the environment. When the head starts, the eye starts; when the head stops, the eye stops.

If the head turns through an angle too great for compensation, the eye jumps rapidly to a new orientation and holds it. Thus, a man on a mountaintop who turns around completely, taking several seconds for the act, keeps his eyes anchored to the dual ambient array for the whole period except for a small part of the time, totaling only a fraction of a second, during which the jumps have occurred. This is what happens in "looking around," and the result is a vivid perception of the whole environment. This is the natural exploratory activity of the visual system.

What experimenters do, however, is to put the subject in a rotating chair and turn him passively. In this unnatural situation a reflex response of the eyes is aroused to the stimulus of acceleration in the semicircular canals of the inner ear. It is called nystagmus. The compensatory turning of the eyes then has a certain latency; it does not begin with the turning of the head as does the compensatory turning of the eyes with an active head movement. The latter is not a reflex to a stimulus but a coordination. The head turning and the eye turning are concurrent movements of a single act. The active turning of the head involves the opposite turning of the eyes in much the same way that the Looking with the Head and Eyes 201

contracting of the extensor muscles of a limb involves the relaxing of the flexor muscles. The neck muscles and the eye muscles are innervated at the same time, reciprocally. But the passive movement of the eyes in response to a passive movement of the head has received by far the most attention from experi- menters. Physiologists are preoccupied with reflexes to stimuli, probably because they assume that reflexes are basic for behavior.

Experiments on ocular nystagmus with passive rotation often bring about a kind of disorientation of the eyes to the environment called vertigo. After stopping such rotation, the eyes will compensate for a nonexistent turning of the head. The experimenter has overstrained the capacity of the system. The observer reports that the world seems to be going around and usually that he feels as if his body were also being rotated. These two experiences are inconsistent. He usually just says that he is dizzy. He is at any rate disoriented to the environment: he cannot point to things, he will stagger, and somtimes fall down. I have described the limitations of the vestibular apparatus in my chapter on the basic orienting system(Gibson, 19666, Ch. 4.). The study of dizziness, however interesting and important for neurology, tells us nothing about the normal working of the eye- head system. I would explain it by saying that the normal complementarity of exteroception and proprioception has broken down.

A Reconsideration of Eye Movements

Ecological optics as distinguished from eyeball optics calls for a re-examination of the traditional eye movements. We must consider how the visual system works, not just how the eyes move. Eyeball optics is appropriate for visual physiology and the prescribing of eyeglasses but not for the psychology of visual perception. Fixation

The prolonged fixing of the eyes on an "object or part of an object,"the bringing of its image to the fovea and keeping it there, does not occur in life. It is a laboratory artifice, brought about when an experimenter tells an observer to stare at a "fixation point"that is usually of no interest to her. No one stares at a fixed point in the world for long unless she is so preoccupied that she is actually not seeing what she looks at. Seeming exceptions arise in the aiming of a rifle or the threading of a needle, but these are actually cases where different objects are aligned, not where a single object is fixated. The eyes normally search, explore, or scan, and there are seldom fewer than several saccadic jumps per second. They look at but do not fixate.

Even when fixation is artificially prolonged in the laboratory, it turns out not to be pure fixation, a steady posture. The eye is never literally fixed. It undergoes a series of miniature movements or microsaccades. The recording of such eye movements has become very precise in recent years, and the evidence now 202 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

suggests that looking at a tiny thing consists of making tiny movements. If so, looking is always exploring, even so-called fixating. On the smallest scale, the eyes could never be perfectly steady, for the eye muscles that control their posture undergo tremor and the eyes tremble in the same way that the hand does when you hold it out. There does not seem to be any clear separation between large saccades, small saccades, microsaccades, and tremor. Perhaps the general conclu- sion should be that an eye-posture is nothing but movements that are very small.

This conclusion is consistent with my conception of the ambient optic array. It consists of adjacent visual solid angles that are nested, each solid angle having its base in a feature or face or facet of the environmental layout, the features being themselves nested in superordinate and subordinate units. The eyes can explore the large details of large solid angles. And the eye-head system can explore the hemispheric solid angles of the sky and the earth or of the mountains to the east and the valley to the west. We perceive a large mural painting with sweeps of the eyes. We perceive a page of print with small saccades. And one puts a thread into the eye of a needle with the tiniest saccades of all.

Saccadic Movement

The jump of the eyeball from one fixation to another, it seems, can vary from an angle of many degrees to one of a few minutes of arc or less. So, just as there is no pure fixation, there is also no pure movement. There are postures of the eyes that are relatively stable and movements of the eyes from one such posture to another, but they grade into each other. Moving and fixating are comple- mentary. They combine in the act of scanning.

It is certainly a fallacy to assume that a saccadic movement is a response to a "stimulus"on the periphery of the retina that brings it to the fovea. There are no stimuli in an optic array. That assumption comes from experiments in which a point of light is flashed on in utter darkness; the eyes then turn so as to foveate it, but this experimental situation does not apply to everyday vision. Visual physiologists, however, presuppose an array of stimuli and assume that a localizing movement, a "fixation reflex," tends to occur for each retinal point when it is stimulated.

It is also a fallacy, if a little more plausible, to assume that a series of fixations is a series of acts of selective attention to the different objects in the world. Each fixation would then be a centering of foveal attention on one object to the exclusion of other objects. Each saccade must then be a movement of attention from one object to another. But the truth is that attention is not only selective, it is also integrative. Attention can be distributed as well as being concentrated. The awareness of details is not inconsistent with the awareness of wholes. Each in fact implies the other. One can perfectly well pay attention to some aspect of the environment that extends over a large angle of the ambient array, such as Looking with the Head and Eyes 203

the gradient of the ground that goes all the way from one's feet out to the horizon. Hence, a whole series of fixations can be a single act of attention.

Pursuit Movement

Not just a fixation of the eyes on a moving object in the world, pursuit move- ment is also, and usually, an adjustment of the ocular system to the flowing ambient array during locomotion of the observer. The centrifugal outflow of the optic array from the direction in which one is traveling must be attended to in order to see where one is going, and in order to control one's locomotion. The eyes are pointed at one element of the flowing array so that all the other elements of the flow pattern that fall into lawful relationships to it can be picked up. This is what happens when you drive your car down the road: your eyes fix on a piece of the layout and track it downward, then jump ahead to a new piece. These drifts and jumps are somewhat similar to the compensatory nystagmus with head turning, but the drifts during locomotion are not the same as the drifts during compensation.

Convergence and Divergence

Retinal image optics assumes that if one object in space has an image in each of the two eyes the two images have to be fused into one picture in the brain. It further assumes that convergence or divergence of the eyes somehow works in the interests of this fusion process. If the physiological images were not combined or unified, we should see two objects instead of one. Ecological optics makes no such assumptions, rejecting the very idea of a physiological image transmitted to the brain. It supposes that two eyes have no more difficulty in perceiving one object than two hands do in feeling one object, or than two ears do in perceiving one event. The dual ocular system registers both the matching of structure between the optic arrays at the different points of observation of the two eyes and the perspective mismatch of their structure, both the congruence and the disparity, at the same time. The two eyes are not two channels of sensation but a single system. The converging and diverging of the eyes presumably work in the interests of picking up the congruity/disparity information.

Note that two arrays could not possibly be fused in the sense of being united in one location. Neither could two optical images be mixed or combined. They do not need to be. The fallacy of the traditional theory comes from supposing that two physiological images have to be fused in the brain, as if one picture were picked up and superposed on the other and then compared, in the manner of a photographer who puts one transparent film on top of another and looks to see if they match. The error is to assume that a unitary mental image can only arise from a unitary brain image, a process in the brain that occurs in one locus. 204 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The human binocular system extracts the similarities of structure between two arrays, I suggest, just as each eye extracts the invariants of structure in its own array. Varying convergence of the binocular system is a kind of exploration, like the varying fixation of each monocular system. The dual array is available for exploration just as much as the single array is. The difference in perspective structure between two arrays is the same as the change in perspective structure of one array when one eye moves sideways through the interocular distance. This disparity is neither identity at one extreme nor discrepancy at the other. If the structures were completely identical, nothing would be specified but a hypothetical and ecologically impossible surface called a horopter. If the structures were completely discrepant, another kind of impossibility would be specified, and this discrepancy can actually be imposed on the binocular system with a device called a haploscope. For example, the array to one eye may consist of vertical stripes and the array to the other of horizontal stripes. In this case the binocular system fails, and the use of one eye is suppressed. The system becomes monocular. Typically, the suppression shifts from one eye to the other, and the result is called binocular rivalry. You see horizontal stripes or vertical stripes, or horizontal in one part of the field and vertical in the other, but never horizontal stripes and vertical stripes in the same place at the same time.

This kind of contradiction is very interesting. It is not logical contradiction of the sort that philosophers have studied since Aristotle. It might be called ecological contradiction. It is a discrepancy of information. There will be more about this in Chapter 14 on depiction.

ON BINOCULAR DISPARITY

The idea of disparity between two arrays is quite new. It is not the same as

the old idea of disparity between two retinal images defined by noncorres-

ponding points on two retinas considered as receptive mosaics. Array

disparity rests on ecological optics instead of on physiological optics.

The application of the new optics to binocular disparity has been worked

out by Barrand (1978). Although anticipated by the gestalt theorists in the

assumption that binocular disparity was "relational," it is a departure from

the classical theory of stereopsis. It can handle the neglected fact of occluding

edges in stereopsis, for example, which the classical theory cannot.

Compensatory Movement

When we consider the ambient optic array at the point of observation occupied by an eye instead of the retinal image of an object formed in the eye by light rays, we begin to understand the purpose of the compensatory eye-head Looking with the Head and Eyes 205

FIGURE 12.2 The turning of the eyes in the head to compensate for the turning of the head in the world.

As the head turns to the right, the eyes turn to the left through the same angle. In this diagram the eyes are converged. (From The Perception of the Visual World by James Jerome Gibson and used with the agreement of the reprint publisher, Greenwood Press, Inc.)

coordination. Its purpose is to keep the eye oriented to the unchanging features of the environment for as much of the time as possible while the observer looks around and gets about. It prevents both eyes from wandering or drifting aimlessly. They are linked to the layout of the surfaces. Only if they are stable relative to the world can they look at the world. The eyes do tend to drift or wander when the ambient light is homogeneous, as it is in the presence of an unstructured total field like the blue sky or a dense fog or in ambient darkness. The compensation is automatic, but it is not a reflex response to a stimulus. If the eyes were not anchored, the phenomenal world would "swing"instead of being the fixed frame of reference it is. Indeed, the experience of vertigo does arise whenever the coordinate compensation breaks down after the stopping of prolonged passive rotation in a swivel chair.

The so-called swinging of the scene can be artificially induced in another way when the structure of the field of view of the eye is distorted or reversed by a prism or lens attached to the head by a spectacle frame. The field of view no longer sweeps over the ambient array in the normal manner when the head turns. Thus, the compensatory eye movements no longer serve their purpose, for the sampling of the array by head turning has been disturbed. The eyes are no longer anchored to the environment. The results of experiments on percep- tion when distorting spectacles are worn can only be understood in the light of this fact (Kohler, 1964). 206 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Other Adjustments of The Visual System

The movements and postures of the eye-head system have now been described. But vision is a highly tuned and elaborate mode of perception, and several other kinds of adjustment occur in the activity of looking. The eyes blink, the tear glands secrete, the pupils enlarge or contract, the lens accommodates, and the retina adjusts for either daytime or nighttime illumination. All these adjust- ments subserve the pickup of information.

Eye-blinking

The eyelids close and reopen at intervals during waking hours to keep the transparent surface of the cornea washed clean and prevent it from drying out. The retina is of course deprived of stimulation during these brief moments of eye-closing, but the interesting fact is that no sensation of darkening is noticed, although even the briefest dimming of the illumination when the electric light falters is noticed. The explanation, perhaps, is simply that this particular kind of flicker is propriospecific. A dimming obtained with an eye-blink is experi- enced as an eye-blink; a dimming imposed by the illumination is experienced as coming from the world.

The ordinary eye-blink is not a triggered reflex. It may sometimes be stim- ulated by a puff of air or a cinder on the cornea, but it usually operates to prevent stimulation, not to respond to it. Like the closing of the eyes during sleep, it is an adjustment.

The eyelids work in cooperation with the tear glands. The reason for keeping the surface of the cornea clear is (by analogy with a windshield wiper)that dirt or foreign particles reduce its transparency. The structure of the optic array when the air is clear can be extremely fine, and these very small solid angles specify both the small-scale structure of the near environment and the large- scale structure of the far environment. A dirty cornea still admits light to the eye but degrades the information in the array of light.

The Accommodation of the Lens

The combined cornea and lens of the eye constitute a lens system that is said to focus an image of an object on the retina, in accordance with the classical theory formulated by Johannes Kepler. To each radiating point on the near surface of the object there corresponds, ideally, one focus point in the retinal image. The function of the lens is to make it a true point instead of a "blur circle,"whatever the distance of the object. The lens accommodates for distance and minimizes the blur (Chapter 4).

The theory of ambient light and its structure is not consistent with this, or at least I do not now understand how it could be made consistent. The notion Looking with the Head and Eyes 207

of nested solid angles based on a nested layout of surfaces, the solid angles being ever changing and never frozen, is of a different order from the notion of radi- ation from the atoms of a surface and the bringing to a focus of a pencil of these rays from each point of the surface. I do not understand how the former notion could be reduced to the latter, for they are in different realms of discourse

The focusing of the lens of a photographic camera for a given distance or range of distances is not as similar to the accommodating of the lens of an eye as we have been taught. There is just enough similarity to make optometry and the prescribing of eyeglasses a useful technology. But the eye's lens works as part of the exploratory mechanism of the visual system, along with fixation and conver- gence, and nothing in the photographic camera is comparable to this. Photographic film does not scan, or look at, or pick up disparity. We are so accustomed to think of deficiencies in accommodation in terms of an acuity chart that we tend to forget this fact. Distinct vision with a fixated eye is not the only test for good visual perception, but that is all the optometrist tries to measure.

The function of the retina is to register invariants of structure, not the points of an image. The point-to-point correspondence of the theory of image formation does not apply. Ecological optics will have to explain the action of the ocular lens in a different way than does classical geometrical optics. The explanation is not simple.

The Adjustment of the Pupil

In Chapter 4, I distinguished carefully between stimulus energy and stimulus information, between ambient light and the ambient array. Light as energy is necessary if the photochemicals in the photoreceptors of the retina are to react, but light as a structural array is necessary if the visual system is to pick up information about the world. Although a clear distinction should be made, it must not be forgotten that stimulus information is carried by stimulus energy. There is no information in utter darkness. And, at the other extreme, percep- tion fails in blazing illumination. The photoreceptors are then swamped by the intense light, and the information cannot be extracted by the perceptual system. We describe the accompanying sensation as dazzle, and it is propriospecific. The contracting of the pupil of the eye is an adjustment that reduces the tend- ency of the photoreceptors to be overwhelmed by excessive stimulation.

Physiological optics, concerned with receptors and stimulus energy, is adequate to explain the pupillary adjustment. Ecological optics, concerned with perceptual organs and the information in light, is not required. The different levels of optics correspond to different levels of activity in the visual system. It should nevertheless be noted that the contraction of the pupil in strong illumin- ation and its enlargement in weak illumination work in the interests of inform- ation pickup. And the continuous adjustment of pupil size to light intensity is not a series of responses to stimuli but an optimizing process. 208 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The Dark Adaptation of the Retina

One kind of adjustment of the retina to the level of illumination involves no movement at all. This is a shift between the functioning of one set of photore- ceptors and another set containining different photochemicals and with a different level of sensitivity. We have what is called a duplex retina, and the duplicity theory of the retina is one of the triumphs of the study of vision at the cellular level. The cones provide for daylight vision and the rods for night vision. The shift of function from cones to rods and the reverse is supple- mentary to the adjustment of the pupil, which by itself is insufficient for the million-to-one intensity difference between daylight and nightlight.

I have described the advantages of a night retina, a day retina, and a duplex retina in the chapter on the evolution of the visual system in The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 9). Animals of our sort are able to perceive well enough in either a brightly or a dimly lighted environ- ment and thus do not have to make a choice between a diurnal and a nocturnal way of life.

Conclusion: The Functions of the Visual System

The anatomical parts of the visual system are, approximately, the body, the head, the eyes, the appurtenances of an eye (eyelid, pupil, and lens), and finally the retina of an eye, which is composed of photocells and nerve cells. The body includes all the other parts, and the cell includes none of the others. All these components are connected with the nervous system, and all are active. All are necessary for visual perception. Both the parts and their activities form a hier- archy of organs. At the top is the body, then the head, and then the eyes. Being equipped with muscles, the parts can move, each in its own way-the eyes relative to the head, the head relative to the body. and the body relative to the environment. Hence, all move relative to the environment, and I suggested that their purpose is perceptual exploration. At the level of the single eye, the eylid wipes, the lens accommodates, and the pupil adjusts. Muscles are also required for these activities, but they are not bodily movements in the sense used above. At the bottom level, the retina and its cells adapt to external conditions but the activity of the retina does not depend on muscles. At all levels the activities are adjustments of the system instead of reflex reactions to stimuli, or "motor'" responses, or responses of any kind, for that matter.

The body explores the surrounding environment by locomotion; the head explores the ambient array by turning; and the eyes explore the two samples of the array, the fields of view, by eye movements. These might be called explor- atory adjustments. At the lower levels, eyelid, lens, pupil, and retinal cells make what might be called optimizing adjustments. Both the global structure and the fine structure of an array constitute information. The observer needs to look Looking with the Head and Eyes 209

around, to look at, to focus sharply, and to neglect the amount of light. Perception needs to be both comprehensive and clear. The visual system hunts for comprehension and clarity. It does not rest until the invariants are extracted. Exploring and optimizing seem to be the functions of the system.

The Fallacy of the Stimulus Sequence Theory

The traditional assumption has been that we perceive the world by means of a sequence of stimuli. When we look at the scene in front of us, we see it in a succes- sion of glimpses analogous to snapshots, each glimpse corresponding to a pure fixation. Similarly, when we look around at the whole environment, we perceive it as a sequence of visual fields analogous to pictures, each field corresponding to a posture of the head. Both the glimpses and the pictures of the world have been vaguely identified with retinal images. But this assumption that we perceive in a sequence of pictures, either glimpses or fields, is quite false.

THE LORGNETTE TACHISTOSCOPE

I once devised a sort of test of what perception would be like if it really

consisted of a sequence of snapshots. I mounted the shutter of a camera on

a handle so that it could be held close to one eye and triggered with a finger,

giving a wide-angle glimpse of the environment for a fifth of a second or less.

The other eye was covered. The subject was led up to a table on which was

a collection of familiar objects and told to keep looking until he knew what

was there. Because he couldn't scan the table with his eye, he had to scan

with his head and trigger the shutter for each new fixation.

Perception was seriously disturbed, and the task was extremely difficult.

What took only a few seconds with normal looking required many fixations

with the lorgnette tachistoscope, and there were many errors. I now begin to

understand why.

A visual fixation is not at all comparable to a snapshot, that is, a momentary exposure. The eye has no shutter. The eye scans over the field. The fovea is transposed over the sample of the array, and the structure of the array remains invariant. Not even a visual field at a head-posture is comparable to a picture in a sequence of pictures (although I used to think it was). The field sweeps over the ambient array with progressive gain and loss at its leading and trailing edges, and the ambient structure remains invariant. No succession of discrete images occurs, either in scanning or in looking around.

The transposition of the fovea over the sample of the array and the sweeping of the edges of the field of view over the ambient array are propriospecific; they 210 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

specify eye turning and head turning respectively, which is precisely what they should do. The former is visual kinesthesis for an eve movement, and the latter is visual kinesthesis for a head movement.

The formula of visual kinesthesis for the exploratory movements of the eyes, and of the head and eyes together, resolves a number of long-standing puzzles concerning visual sensations. It cuts a Gordian knot. The century-old problem of why the world does not seem to move when the eyes move and the analogous problem of why the room does not appear to go around when one looks around are unnecessary. They only arise from the assumption that visual stimuli and visual sensations are the elements of visual perception. If the visual system is assumed instead to detect its own movements along with extracting the inform- ation about the world from the ambient light, the puzzles disappear. I shall have more to say about this later.

The false problems stem from the false analogy between photography and visual perception that everyone has taken for granted. A photograph is an arrested moment of a changing array. The film has to be exposed, and the so-called latent image must be developed, fixed, and printed before it becomes a picture. But there is nothing even faintly comparable to a latent image in the retina. It is misleading enough to compare the eye with a camera, but it is even worse to compare the retina with a photographic film.

The stimulus-sequence theory of perception underlies much of modern thought, not only the thinking of philosophers, psychologists, and physiologists but that of the man in the street. It is reinforced by comic strips and cartoons and news photographs, and the movies above all. As children we do learn much about the world at second hand from picture sequences, so much that we are strongly tempted to interpret firsthand experience in the same way. Everybody knows what pictures are, and textbooks tell us that retinal images are pictures. I said so myself in my book on the visual world, and the only problem that bothered me was how a sequence of images could be converted into a scene (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 8，pp. 158 ff.). I did realize that something was wrong with this assertion, but it took me years to detect the fallacy.

The Theory of the Conversion of a Sequence into a Scene

It sounds plausible to assert that a sequence of images is converted into a scene. "At the circus, for example, you may watch the tightrope walker, then look at the performing seals, pause to observe a clown, and return to the tightrope walker. Although you have had a succession of impressions the events are perceived as coexisting"(Gibson, 1950b, p. 158). You are aware of three concur- rent events in three different places, all going on at the same time, but you are not aware of the successive order in which they have been fixated. An adjacent order of places, a whole scene, must have been obtained from a successive order of sensory inputs, a sequence, by some sort of conversion. The sequence of smaller Looking with the Head and Eyes 211

fixations with which you observe the tightrope walker in his smaller situation is noticed even less. You look back and forth between his feet and his hands, say, but what you see is the whole act.

The hypothesis of conversion is consistent with the traditional theory that successive inputs of a sensory nerve are processed, that a series of signals is inter- preted, or that the incoming data of sense are operated on by the mind. Sensations are converted into perceptions, and the question is, how does this come about? In the case of successive retinal images, the process is supposed to be that of memory. It may be called short-term or primary memory, or immediate memory as distinguished from long-term memory, but the basic assumption is that each image has to be held over, or stored in some sense, in order for the sequence to be integrated, that is, combined into a unit. The present percept is nothing without past percepts, but past percepts cannot combine with the present except as memories. Every item of experience has to be carried forward into the present in order to make possible perception in the present. Memories have to accumulate. This is the traditional theory of memory made explicit. It is full of difficulties, but it has seemed to provide the only explanation of how images could be integrated.

The error was to suppose in the first place that perception of the environment is based on a sequence of discrete images. If it is based instead on invariance in a flow of stimulation, the problem of integration does not arise. There is no need to unify or combine different pictures if the scene is in the sequence, is specified by the invariant structure that underlies the samples of the ambient array.

The problem of explaining the experience of what I once called the unbounded visual world (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 8) or what I would now call the surrounding environment is a false problem. The retinal image is bounded, to be sure, and the foveal image has even smaller bounds, but the ambient array is unbounded. If the stimulation of the retina, or that of the fovea, is accepted as basic, another problem arises as well, how to explain the experience of a stable visual world. The stimulation of the retina is continually shifting, but this is also a false problem, for the structure of the ambient array is quite stable.

Summary

One sees the environment not just with the eyes but with the eyes in the head on the shoulders of a body that gets about. We look at details with the eyes, but we also look around with the mobile head, and we go-and-look with the mobile body.

A theory of how the eye-head system works has been formulated in this chapter. A theory of how the system works during locomotion was formulated in the last chapter. The exploratory adjustments of the eye-head system (fixa- tion, saccadic movements, pursuit movements, convergence-divergence, and compensatory movements)are easier to understand. Even the optimizing 212 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

adjustments of the lens, the pupil, and the photoreceptors are more intelligible when we consider optical information instead of stimuli.

The flow of optical stimulation is not a sequence of stimuli or a series of discrete snapshots. If it were, the sequence would have to be converted into a scene. The flow is sampled by the visual system. And the persistence of the environment together with the coexistence of its parts and the concurrence of its events are all perceived together. 

## 13. Locomotion and Manipulation

The theory of affordances implies that to see things is to see how to get about among them and what to do or not do with them. If this is true, visual percep- tion serves behavior, and behavior is controlled by perception. The observer who does not move but only stands and looks is not behaving at the moment, it is true, but he cannot help seeing the affordances for behavior in whatever he looks at.

Moving from place to place is supposed to be"physical"whereas perceiving is supposed to be "mental,"but this dichotomy is misleading. Locomotion is guided by visual perception. Not only does it depend on perception but percep- tion depends on locomotion inasmuch as a moving point of observation is necessary for any adequate acquaintance with the environment. So we must perceive in order to move, but we must also move in order to perceive.

Manipulation is another kind of behavior that depends on perception and also facilitates perception. Let us consider in this chapter how vision enters into these two kinds of behavior.

The Evolution of Locomotion and Manipulation

Support

Animals, no less than other bodies, are pulled downward by the force of gravity. They fall unless supported. In water the animal is supported by the medium, which has about the same density as its body. But in air the animal must have a substantial surface below if it is not to become a Newtonian falling body.

Locomotion has evolved from swimming in the sea to crawling and walking on land to clinging and climbing on the protuberances that clutter up the land 214 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

and, finally, to flying through the air, the most rapid kind of locomotion but the most risky. Fish are supported by the medium, terrestrial animals by a substan- tial surface on the underside, and birds (when they are not at rest) by airflow, the aerodynamic force called lift. Zoologists sometimes classify animals as aquatic, terrestrial, or aerial, having in mind the different ways of getting about in water, on land, or in the air.

Visual Perception of Support

A terrestrial animal must have a surface that pushes up on its feet, or its underside. The experiments reported in Chapter 4 with the glass floor appar- atus suggest that many terrestrial animals cannot maintain normal posture unless they can see their feet on the ground. With optical information to specify their feet off the ground, they act as if they were falling freely, crouching and showing signs of fear. But when a textured surface is brought up under the glass floor, the animals stand and walk normally (E. J. Gibson, 1969, pp.267-270).

This result implies that contact of the feet with the surface of support as against separation of the feet from the surface is specified optically, at the occluding edges of the feet. The animal who moves its head or uses two eyes can perceive either no separation in depth between its feet and the floor or the kind of separation it would see if it were suspended in air. Contact is specified both optically and mechanically

Note that a rigid surface of earth can be distinguished from a nonrigid surface of water by its color, texture, and the absence or presence of ripples. A surface of water does not afford support for chicks, but it does for ducklings. The latter take to the water immediately after hatching; the former do not.

Manipulation

Manipulation presumably evolved in primates, along with bipedal locomotion and the upright posture, by the conversion of the forelimbs from legs into arms and of the forepaws into what we call hands. Walking on two legs, it is some- times said, leaves the hands free for other acts. The hands are specified by "five- pronged squirming protrusions"into the field of view from below (Chapter 7). They belong to the self, but they are constantly touching the objects of the outer world by reaching and grasping. The shapes and sizes of objects, in fact, are perceived in relation to the hands, as graspable or not graspable, in terms of their affordances for manipulation. Infant primates learn to see objects and their hands in conjunction. The perception is constrained by manipulation, and the manipulation is constrained by perception. Locomotion and Manipulation 215

The Control of Locomotion and Manipulation

Locomotion and manipulation, like the movements of the eyes described in the last chapter, are kinds of behavior that cannot be reduced to responses. The persistent effort to do so by physiologists and psychologists has come to a dead end. But the ancient Cartesian doctrine still hangs on, that animals are reflex mahines and that humans are the same except for a soul that rules the body by switching impulses at the center of the brain. The doctrine will not do. Locomotion and manipulation are not triggered by stimuli from outside the body, nor are they initiated by commands from inside the brain. Even the clas- sification of incoming impulses in nerves as sensory and outgoing impulses as motor is based on the old doctrine of mental sensations and physical movements. Neurophysiologists, most of them, are still under the influence of dualism, however much they deny philosophizing. They still assume that the brain is the seat of the mind. To say, in modem parlance, that it is a computer with a program, either inherited or acquired, that plans a voluntary action and then commands the muscles to move is only a little better than Descartes's theory, for to say this is still to remain confined within the doctrine of responses.

Locomotion and manipulation are neither triggered nor commanded but controlled. They are constrained, guided, or steered, and only in this sense are they ruled or governed. And they are controlled not by the brain but by information, that is, by seeing oneself in the world. Control lies in the animal- environment system. Control is by the animal in its world, the animal itself having subsystems for perceiving the environment and concurrently for getting about in it and manipulating it. The rules that govern behavior are not like laws enforced by an authority or decisions made by a commander; behavior is regular without being regulated. The question is how this can be.

WHAT HAPPENS TO INFANT PRIMATES DEPRIVED OF

THE SIGHT OF THEIR HANDS?

Monkeys reared from birth in a device that kept them from seeing the hands

and body but not from feeling them move and touching things were very

abnormal monkeys. When freed from the device, they acted at first as if they

could not reach for and grasp an object but must grope for it. An opaque

shield with a cloth bib fitted tightly around the monkey's neck had elimin-

ated visual kinesthesis and had thus prevented the development of visual

control of reaching and grasping. So I interpret the results of an experiment

by R. Held and J. A. Bauer (1974). See my discussion of the optical informa-

tion for hand movement in Chapter 7. 216 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The medium Contains the Information for Control

It should be kept in mind that animals live in a medium that, being insubstan- tial, permits them to move about, if supported. We are tempted to call the medium"space,"but the temptation should be resisted. For the medium, unlike space, permits a steady state of reverberating illumination to become estab- lished such that it contains information about surfaces and their substances. That is, there is an array at every point of observation and a changing array at every moving point of observation. The medium, as distinguished from space, allows compression waves from a mechanical event, sound, to reach all points of observation and also allows the diffusion field from a volatile substance, odor, to reach them (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 1). The odor is specific to the volatile substance, the sound is specific to the event, and the visual solid angle is the most specific of all, containing all sorts of structured invariants for perceiving the affordance of the object. This is why to perceive something is also to perceive how to approach it and what to do about it.

Information in a medium is not propagated as signals are propagated but is contained. Wherever one goes, one can see, hear, and smell. Hence, perception in the medium accompanies locomotion in the medium.

Visual Kinesthesis and Control

Before getting into the problem of control, we should be clear about the differ- ence between active and passive movement, a difference that is especially important in the case of locomotion. For animal locomotion may be uncon- trolled; the animal may be simply transported. This can happen in various ways. A flow of the medium can transport the animal, as happens to the bird in a wind and the fish in a stream. Or an individual may be transported by another animal, as happens to a monkey clinging to its mother or a baby carried in a cradleboard. Or the observer may be a passenger in a vehicle. In all these cases, the animal can see its locomotion without initiating, governing, or steering it. The animal has the information for transportation but cannot regulate it. In my terminology, the observer has visual kinesthesis but no visual control of the movement. This distinction is essential to an understanding of the problem of control. The traditional theory of the senses is incapable of making it, however, and followers of the traditional theory become mired in the conceptual confu- sion arising from the slippery notion of feedback.

Visual kinesthesis specifies locomotion relative to the environment, whereas the other kinds of kinesthesis may or may not do so. The control oflocomotion in the environment must therefore be visual. Walking, bicycling, and driving involve very different kinds of classical kinesthesis but the same visual kines- thesis. The muscle movements must be governed by vision. If you want to go somewhere, or to know where you are going, you can only trust your eyes. The Locomotion and Manipulation 217

bird in a wind even has to fly in order to stay in the same place. To prevent

being carried away, it must arrest the flow of the ambient array.

Before we can hope to understand controlled locomotion, therefore, we

must answer several preliminary questions about the information in ambient

light. I can think of four. What specifies locomotion or stasis? What specifies

an obstacle or an opening? What specifies imminent contact with a surface?

What specifies the benefit or the injury that lies ahead? These questions must

be answered before we can begin to ask what the rules are for starting and stop-

ping, for approaching and retreating, for going this way or that way, and so on.

The Optical Information Necessary for Control of Locomotion

For each of the four questions above, I shall list a number of assertions about

optical information. I will try to put together what the previous chapters have

established.

What Specifies Locomotion or Stasis?

1. Flow of the ambient array specifies locomotion, and nonflow specifies stasis. By

flow is meant the change analyzed as motion perspective (Gibson, Olum, and

Rosenblatt, 1955)for the abstract case of an uncluttered environment and a

moving point of observation. A better term would be flow perspective, or streaming

perspective. It yields the"melon-shaped family of curves"illustrated in Figure 13.1

and is based on rays of light from particles of the terrain, not on solid angles from

features of the terrain. Thus, it has the great advantages of geometrical analysis

but also has its disadvantages. Nevertheless, the flow as such specifies locomotion

and the invariants specify the layout of surfaces in which locomotion occurs.

2. Outflow specifies approach to and inflow specifies retreat from. An invariant

feature of the ambient flow is that one hemisphere is centrifugal and the other

centripetal. Outflow entails magnification, and inflow entails minification.

There is always both a going-to and a coming-from during locomotion. A

creature with semipanoramic vision can register both the outflow and the

inflow at the same time, but human creatures can sample only one or the other,

by looking "ahead" or by looking "behind."Note that a reversal of the flow

pattern specifies a reversal of locomotion.

3. The focus or center of outflow specifies the direction of locomotion in the environ-

ment. More exactly, that visual solid angle at the center of outflow specifies the

surface in the environment, or the object, or the opening, toward which the

animal is moving. This statement is not analytical. Because the overall flow is

radial in both hemispheres, the two foci are implicit in any sufficiently large

sample of the ambient array, and even humans can thus see where they are going

without having to look where they are going. The "melon-shaped family of

curves"continues outside the edges of the temporary field of view. 218 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The vectors are plotted in angular coordinates, and all vectors vanish at the horizon. This drawing should be compared with Figure 7.3 showing the motion perspective to a flying bird. (From Gibson, Olum, and Rosenblatt, 1955. C 1955 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Reprinted by permission of the University of Illinois Press.)

4. A shift of the center of outflow from one visual solid angle to another specifies a change in the direction of locomotion, a turn, and a remaining of the center within the same solid angle specifies no change in direction. The ambient optic array is here supposed to consist of nested solid angles, not of a bundle of lines. The direc- tion of locomotion is thus anchored to the layout, not to a coordinate system. The flow of the ambient array can be transposed over the invariant structure of the array, so that where one is going is seen relative to the surrounding layout. This unfamiliar notion of invariant structure underlying the changing perspective structure is one that I tried to make explicit in Chapter 5; here is a good example of it. The illustrations in Chapter 7 showing arrows superposed on a picture of Locomotion and Manipulation 219

the terrain were supposed to suggest this invariance under change but, of course, it cannot be pictured.

5. Flow of the textured ambient array just behind certain occluding protrusions into the field of view specifies locomotion by an animal with feet. If you lower your head while walking, a pair of moving protrusions enters the field of view from its lower edge (Chapter 7), and these protrusions move up and down alternately. A cat sees the same thing except that what it sees are front feet. The extremities are in optical contact with the flowing array at the locus of maximal flow and maximally coarse texture. They occlude parts of the surface, but it is seen to extend behind them. Convexities and concavities in the surface will affect the timing of contact, and therefore you and the cat must place your feet with regard to the footing.

What Specifies an Obstacle or an Opening?

I distinguish two general cases for the affording of locomotion, which I will call obstacle and opening. An obstacle is a rigid object, detached or attached, a surface with occluding edges. An opening is an aperture, hole, or gap in a surface, also with occluding edges. An obstacle affords collision. An opening affords passage. Both have a closed or nearly closed contour in the optic array, but the edge of the obstacle is inside the contour, whereas the edge of the opening is outside the contour. A round object hides in one direction, and a round opening hides in the opposite direction. The way to tell the difference between an obstacle and an opening, therefore, is as follows.

ON LOOKING AT THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING

It must be admitted that when I turn around while driving our car and reply

to my wife's protests that I can perfectly well see where I am going without

having to look where I am going because the focus of outflow is implicit, she

is not reassured.

6. Loss (or gain) of structure outside a closed contour during approach (or retreat) specifies an obstacle. Gain (or loss) of structure inside a closed contour during approach or retreat) specifies an opening. This is the only absolutely trustworthy way to tell the difference between an obstacle and an opening. In both cases the visual solid angle goes to a hemisphere as you approach it, but you collide with the obstacle and enter the opening. Magnification of the form as such, the outline, does not distinguish them. But as you come up to the obstacle it hides more and more of the vista, and as you come up to the opening it reveals more and more of the vista. Deletion outside the occluding edge and accretion inside the occluding 220 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

edge will distinguish the two. Psychologists and artists alike have been confused about the difference between things and holes, surfaces and apertures. The figure-ground phenomenon that so impressed the gestalt psychologists and that is still taken to be a prototype of perception is misleading. A closed contour as such in the optic array does not specify an object in the environment.

What specifies the near edge of an opening in the ground, a hole or gap in the surface of support? This is very important information for a terrestrial animal.

7. Gain of structure above a horizontal contour in the ambient array during approach specifies a brink in the surface of support. A brink is a drop-off in the ground, a step, or the edge of a perch. It is the essential feature of the experiments on the visual cliff that were described in Chapter 9(for example, E. J. Gibson and Walk, 1960). It is depth downward at an occluding edge, and depending on the amount of depth relative to the size of the animal, it affords stepping-down or falling-off. The rat, chick, or human infant who sees its feet close to such an occluding edge needs to take care. The experimental evidence suggests that the changing occlusion at the edge, not the abrupt increase in the density of optical texture, is the effective information for the animal.

This formula applies to a horizontal contour in the array coming from the ground. What about a vertical contour in the array coming from a wall?

8. Gain of structure on one side of a vertical contour in the ambient array during approach specifies the occluding edge of a barrier, and the side on which gain occurs is the side of the edge that affords passage. This is the edge of a house, the end of a wall, or the vertical edge of a doorway, often loosely called a corner. On one side of the edge the vista beyond is hidden, and on the other side it is revealed; on one side there is potential collision, and on the other potential passage. The trunk of a tree has two such curved edges not far apart. To "go around the corner"is to reveal the surfaces of the new vista. Rats do it in mazes, and people do it in cities. To find one's way in a cluttered environment is to go around a series of occluding edges, and the problem is to choose the correct edges to go around (see Figure 11.2).

What Specifies Imminent Contact with a Surface?

In an early essay on the visual control of locomotion (Gibson, 1958)，I wrote:

Approach to a solid surface is specified by a centrifugal flow of the texture

of the optic array. Approach to an object is specified by a magnification

of the closed contour in the array corresponding to the edges of the

object. A uniform rate of approach is accompanied by an accelerated rate of

magnification. At the theoretical point where the eye touches the object,

the latter will intercept a visual angle of 180°. The magnification reaches

an explosive rate in the last moments before contact. This accelerated

expansion... specifies imminent collision. Locomotion and Manipulation 221

This was true enough as far as it went. I was thinking of the problem of how a pilot lands on a field or how a bee lands on a flower. The explosive magnific- ation, the "looming" as I called it, has to be canceled if a"soft"landing is to be achieved. I never thought of the entirely different problem of steering through an opening. The optical information provided by various kinds of magnifica- tion is evidently not as simple as I thought in 1958.

The complexities were not clarified by the empirical studies of Schiff, Caviness, and Gibson (1962) and Schiff (1965)，who provided the optical information for the approach of an object in space instead of the information for approach to a surface in the environment. They displayed an expanding dark silhouette in the center of a luminous translucent screen, as described in Chapter 10. No one saw himself being transposed; everyone saw something indefinite coming toward them, as if it were in the sky. The display consisted of an expanding single form, a shadow or silhouette, not the magnifying of a nested structure of subordinate forms that characterizes approach to a real surface. The magnifying of detail without limit was missing from the display.

9. The magnification of a nested structure in which progressively finer details keep emerging at the center specifies approach of an observer to a surface in the environment. This formula emphasizes the facets within the faces of a substantial surface, such as that of an obstacle, an object, an animate object, or a surface of rest that the observer might encounter. In order to achieve contact without collision. the nested magnification must be made to cease at the appropriate level instead of continuing to its limit. There seems to be an optimal degree of magnifica- tion for contact with a surface, depending on what it affords. For food one moves up to eating distance; for manipulating one moves up to reaching distance; for print one moves up to reading distance.

What Specifies the Benefit or Injury that Lies Ahead?

Bishop Berkeley suggested in 1709 that the chief end of vision was for animals "to foresee the benefit or injury which is like to ensue upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance." What the philo- sopher called foresight is what I call the perception of the affordance. To see at a distance what the object affords on contact is "necessary for the preservation of an animal."

I differ from Bishop Berkeley in assuming that information is available in the light to the animal for what an encounter with the object affords. But I agree with him about the utility of vision.

10. Affordances for the individual upon encountering an object are specified in the optic array from the object by invariants and invariant combinations. Tools, food, shelter, mates, and amiable animals are distinguished from poisons, fires, weapons, and hostile animals by their shapes, colors, textures, and deformations. The positive and negative affordances of things in the environment are what makes locomotion through 222 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

the medium such a fundamental kind of behavior for animals. Unlike a plant, the animal can go to the beneficial and stay away from the injurious. But it must be able to perceive the affordances from afar. A rule for the visual control of locomotion might be this: so move as to obtain beneficial encounters with objects and places and to prevent injurious encounters.

Rules for the Visual Control of Locomotion

I suggested at the beginning that behavior was controlled by information about the world and the self conjointly. The information has now been described. What about the control?

I asserted that behavior was controlled by rules. Surely, however, they are not rules enforced by an authority. The rules are not commands from a brain; they emerge from the animal-environment system. But the only way to describe rules is in words, and a rule expressed in words is a command. I am faced with a paradox. The rules for the control of locomotion will sound like commands, although they are not intended to. I can only suggest that the reader should interpret them as rules not formulated in words.

The rules that follow are for visual control, not muscular, articular, vestibular. or cutaneous control. The visual system normally supersedes the haptic system for locomotion and manipulation, as I tried to explain in The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966b). This means that the rules for locomotion will be the same for crawling on all fours, walking, running, or driving an automobile. The particular muscles involved do not matter. Any group of muscles will suffice if it brings about the relation of the animal to its environ- ment stated in the rule.

Standing. The basic rule for a pedestrian animal is stand up; that is, keep the feet in contact with a surface of support. It is also well to keep the oval bound- aries of the field of view normal with the implicit horizon of the ambient array; if the head is upright the rest of the body follows.

Starting, stopping, going back. To start, make the array flow. To stop, cancel the flow. To go back, make the flow reverse. According to the first two formulas listed in the previous pages, to cause outflow is to get closer and to cause inflow is to get farther away.

Steering. To turn, shift the center of outflow from one patch in the optic array to another, according to thethe third and fourth formulas. Steering requires that openings be distinguished from barriers, obstacles, and brinks. The rule is: To steer, keep the center of outflow outside the patches of the array that specify barriers, obstacles, and brinks and within a patch that specifies an opening (sixth, seventh, and eighth formulas). Following this rule will avert collisions and prevent falling off.

Approaching. To approach is to magnify a patch in the array, but magnification is complicated (formulas two and six). There are many rules involving magni- fication. Here are a few. To permit scrutiny, magnify the patch in the array to such a Locomotion and Manipulation 223

degree that the details can be looked at. To manipulate something graspable, magnify the patch to such a degree that the object is within reach. To bite something, magnify the patch to such an angle that the mouth can grasp it. To kiss someone, magnify the face-form, if the facial expression is amiable, so as almost to fill the field of view. (It is absolutely essential for one to keep one's eyes open so as to avoid collision. It is also wise to learn to discriminate those subtle invariants that specify amiability.) To read something, magnify the patch to such a degree that the letters become distinguishable. The most general rule for approach is this: To realize the positive affordances of something, magnify its optical structure to that degree necessary for the behavioral encounter.

Entering enclosures. An enclosure such as a burrow, cave, nest, or hut affords various benefits upon entry. It is a place of warmth, a shelter from rain and wind, and a place for sleep. It is often a home, the place where mate and offspring are. It is also a place of safety, a hiding place affording both conceal- ment from enemies and a barrier to their locomotion. An enclosure must have an opening to permit entry, and the opening must be identified. The rule seems to be as follows: to enter an enclosure, magnify the angle of its opening to 180° and open up the vista. Make sure that there is gain of structure inside the contour and not loss outside, or else you will collide with an obstacle (formulas six and nine).

Keeping a safe distance. The opposite of approach is retreat. Psychologists have sometimes assumed that the alternative to approach is retreat. Kurt Lewin's theory of behavior, for example, was based on approach to an object with a positive "valence" and retreat from an object with a negative "valence." This fits with a theory of conflict between approach and retreat, and a compromise between opposite tendencies. But it is wrong to assume that approach and retreat are alternatives. There is no need to flee from an obstacle, a barbed-wire fence, the edge of a river, the edge of a cliff, or a fire. The only need is to maintain a safe distance, a "margin of safety,"since these things do not pursue the observer. A ferocious tiger has a negative valence, but a cliff does not. The rule is this, I think: To prevent an injurious encounter, keep the optical structure of the surface from magnifying to the degree that specifies an encounter (formulas two and ten).

For moving predators and enemies, flight is an appropriate form of action since they can approach. The rule for flight is, so move as to minify the dangerous form and to make the surrounding optic array flow inward. If, despite flight, the form magnifies, the enemy is catching up; if it minifies, one is getting away. At the predator's point of observation, of course, the rule is opposite to that for the prey: so move as to magnify the succulent form by making the surrounding array flow outward until it reaches the proper angular size for capturing.

Rules for the Visual Control of Manipulation

The rules for the visual control of the movements of the hands are more complex than those for the control of locomotion. But the human infant who 224 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

watches these squirming protuberances into his field of view is not formulating rules and, in any case, complexity does not seem to cause trouble for the nervous system. I am unable to formulate the rules in words except for a few easy cases.

Locomotor approach often terminates in reaching and grasping. Reaching is an elongation of the arm-shape and a minification of the five-pronged hand- shape until contact occurs. If the object is hand-size, it is graspable; if too large or too small, it is not. Children learn to see sizes in terms of prehension: they see the span of their grasp and the diameter of a ball at the same time (Gibson, 1966b, fig. 7.1，p. 119). Long before the child can discriminate one inch, or two, or three, he can see the fit of the object to the pincerlike action of the opposable thumb. The child learns his scale of sizes as commensurate with his body, not with a measuring stick.

The affordance of an elongated object for pounding and striking is easily learned. The skill of hammering or striking a target requires visual control, however. It involves what we vaguely call aiming. I will not try to state the rules for aiming except to suggest that it entails a kind of centering or symmetrical- izing of a diminishing form on a fixed form.

Throwing as such is easy. Simply cause the visual angle of the object you have in your hand to shrink, and it will"zoom"in a highly interesting manner. You have to let go, of course, and this is a matter of haptic control, not visual control. Aimed throwing is much harder, as ballplayers know. It is a sort of reciprocal of steered locomotion.

Tool-using in general is rule governed. The rule for pliers is analogous to that for prehending, the tool being metaphorically an extension of the hand. The use of a stick as a rake for getting a banana outside the cage was one of the achievements of a famous chimpanzee (Köhler, 1925).

Knives, axes, and pointed objects afford the cutting and piercing of other objects and surfaces, including other animals. But the manipulation must be carefully controlled, for the observer's own skin can be cut or pierced as well as the other surface. The tool must be grasped by the handle, not the point; that is, the rule for reaching and the rules for maintaining the margin of safety must both be followed. Visual contact with one part of the surface is beneficial but with another part is injurious, and the "sharp"part is not always easy to discrim- inate. The case is similar to that of walking along a cliff edge in this respect: one must steer the movement so as to skirt the danger.

The uses of the hands are almost unlimited. And manipulation subserves many other forms of behavior of which it is only a part, eating, drinking, trans- porting, nursing, caressing, gesturing, and the acts of trace-making, depicting, and writing, which will concern us in Part IV.

The point to remember is that the visual control of the hands is inseparably connected with the visual perception of objects. The act of throwing comple- ments the perception of a throwable object. The transporting of things is part and parcel of seeing them as portable or not. Locomotion and Manipulation 225

Conclusion about manipulation. One thing should be evident. The movements

of the hands do not consist of responses to stimuli. Manipulation cannot be

understood in those terms. Is the only alternative to think of the hands as

instruments of the mind? Piaget, for example, sometimes seems to imply that

the hands are tools of a child's intelligence. But this is like saying that the hand

is a tool of an inner child in more or less the same way that an object is a tool

for a child with hands. This is surely an error. The alternative is not a return to

mentalism. We should think of the hands as neither triggered nor commanded

but controlled.

Manipulation and the Perceiving of Interior Surfaces

Finally, it should be noted that a great deal of manipulation occurs for the sake of

perceiving hidden surfaces. I can think of three kinds of such manipulation:

opening up, uncovering, and taking apart. Each of these has an opposite, as one would

expect from the law of reversible occlusion: closing, covering, and putting together.

Opening and closing apply to the lids and covers of hollow objects and also to

drawers, compartments, cabinets, and other enclosures. Children are fascinated

by the act of opening so as to reveal the interior and closing so as to conceal it.

They then come to perceive the continuity between the inner and the outer

surfaces. The closed box and the covered pot are then seen to have an inside as

well as an outside.

Covering and uncovering apply to a cloth, or a child's blanket, or to revealing

and concealing by an opaque substance, as in a sandbox. The movement of the

hand that conceals the object is not always so clearly the reverse of the move-

ment that reveals it as it is in the case of closing-opening, however. The

perceiving of hidden surfaces may well be more difficult in this case.

Taking apart and putting together apply to an object composed of smaller objects, that is, a composite that can be disassembled and assembled. There are toys of this

sort. Blocks that can be fitted together make such a composite object. Taking apart

is usually a simpler act of manipulation than putting together. Children need to see

what is inside these compound objects, and it is only to be expected that they

should take them apart, or break them apart if need be. After such visual-manual

cooperation, they can perceive the interior surfaces of the object together with the

cracks, joins, and apertures that separate them. This is the way children come to apprehend a mechanism such as a clock or an internal combustion engine.

Summary

Active locomotor behavior, as contrasted with passive transportation, is under

the continuous control of the observer. The dominant level of such control is

visual. But this could not occur without what I have called visual kinesthesis, the

awareness of movement or stasis, of starting or stopping, of approaching or 226 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

retreating, of going in one direction or another, and of the imminence of an encounter. Such awarenesses are necessary for control.

Also necessary is an awareness of the affordance of the encounter that will terminate the locomotor act and of the affordances of the openings and obstacles, the brinks and barriers, and the corners on the way (actually the occluding edges).

When locomotion is thus visually controlled, it is regular without being a chain of responses and is purposive without being commanded from within.

Manipulation, like active locomotion, is visually controlled. It is thus dependent on an awareness of both the hands as such and the affordances for handling. But its regularities are not so easy to formulate. 

## 14. The Theory of Information Pickup and Its Consequences



In this book the traditional theories of perception have been abandoned. The perennial doctrine that two-dimensional images are restored to three- dimensional reality by a process called depth perception will not do. Neither will the doctrine that the images are transformed by the cues for distance and slant so as to yield constancy of size and shape in the perception of objects. The deep-seated notion of the retinal image as a still picture has been abandoned.

The simple assumption that perceptions of the world are caused by stimuli from the world will not do. The more sophisticated assumption that perceptions of the world are caused when sensations triggered by stimuli are supplemented by memories will not do either. Not even the assumption that a sequence of stimuli is converted into a phenomenal scene by memory will do. The very notion of stimulation as typically composed of discrete stimuli has been abandoned.

The established theory that exteroception and proprioception arise when exteroceptors and proprioceptors are stimulated will not do. The doctrine of special channels of sensation corresponding to specific nerve bundles has been abandoned.

The belief of empiricists that the perceived meanings and values of things are supplied from the past experience of the observer will not do. But even worse is the belief of nativists that meanings and values are supplied from the past experience of the race by way of innate ideas. The theory that meaning is attached to experience or imposed on it has been abandoned.

Not even the current theory that the inputs of the sensory channels are subject to "cognitive processing"will do. The inputs are described in terms of inform- ation theory, but the processes are described in terms of old-fashioned mental acts: recognition, interpretation, inference, concepts, ideas, and storage and retrieval ofideas. These are still the operations of the mind upon the deliverances 228 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

of the senses, and there are too many perplexities entailed in this theory. It will not do, and the approach should be abandoned.

What sort of theory, then, will explain perception? Nothing less than one based on the pickup of information. To this theory, even in its undeveloped state, we should now turn.

Let us remember once again that it is the perception of the environment that we wish to explain. If we were content to explain only the perception of forms or pictures on a surface, of nonsense figures to which meanings must be attached, of discrete stimuli imposed on an observer willy-nilly, in short, the items most often presented to an observer in the laboratory, the traditional theories might prove to be adequate and would not have to be abandoned. But we should not be content with that limited aim. It leaves out of account the eventful world and the perceiver's awareness of being in the world. The labor- atory does not have to be limited to simple stimuli, so-called. The experiments reported in Chapters 9 and 10 showed that information can be displayed.

What is New About the Pickup of Information?

The theory of information pickup differs radically from the traditional theories of perception. First, it involves a new notion of perception, not just a new theory of the process. Second, it involves a new assumption about what there is to be perceived. Third, it involves a new conception of the information for perception, with two kinds always available, one about the environment and another about the self. Fourth, it requires the new assumption of perceptual systems with overlapping functions, each having outputs to adjustable organs as well as inputs from organs. We are especially concerned with vision, but none of the systems, listening, touching, smelling, or tasting, is a channel of sense. Finally, fifth, optical information pickup entails an activity of the system not heretofore imagined by any visual scientist, the concurrent registering of both persistence and change in the flow of structured stimulation. This is the crux of the theory but the hardest part to explicate, because it can be phrased in different ways and a terminology has to be invented.

Consider these five novelties in order, ending with the problem of detecting variants and invariants or change and nonchange.

A Redefinition of Perception

Perceiving is an achievement of the individual, not an appearance in the theater of his consciousness. It is a keeping-in-touch with the world, an experiencing of things rather than a having of experiences. It involves awareness-of instead of just awareness. It may be awareness of something in the environment or something in the observer or both at once, but there is no content of awareness independent of that of which one is aware. This is close to the act psychology of The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 229 the nineteenth century except that perception is not a mental act. Neither is it a bodily act. Perceiving is a psychosomatic act, not of the mind or of the body but of a living observer.

The act of picking up information, moreover, is a continuous act, an activity that is ceaseless and unbroken. The sea of energy in which we live flows and changes without sharp breaks. Even the tiny fraction of this energy that affects the receptors in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin is a flux, not a sequence. The exploring, orienting, and adjusting of these organs sink to a minimum during sleep but do not stop dead. Hence, perceiving is a stream, and William James's description of the stream of consciousness (1890, Ch. 9)applies to it. Discrete percepts, like discrete ideas, are "as mythical as the Jack of Spades."

The continuous act of perceiving involves the coperceiving of the self. At least, that is one way to put it. The very term perception must be redefined to allow for this fact, and the word proprioception must be given a different meaning than it was given by Sherrington.

A New Assertion About What is Perceived

My description of the environment (Chapters 1-3) and of the changes that can occur in it (Chapter 6) implies that places, attached objects, objects, and substances are what are mainly perceived, together with events, which are changes of these things. To see these things is to perceive what they afford. This is very different from the accepted categories of what there is to perceive as described in the textbooks. Color, form, location, space, time, and motion- these are the chapter headings that have been handed down through the centuries, but they are not what is perceived.

Places

A place is one of many adjacent places that make up the habitat and, beyond that. the whole environment. But smaller places are nested within larger places. They do not have boundaries, unless artificial boundaries are imposed by surveyors (my piece of land, my town, my country, my state). A place at one level is what you can see from here or hereabouts, and locomotion consists of going from place to place in this sense (Chapter 11). A very important kind of learning for animals and children is place-learning-learning the affordances of places and learning to distinguish among them-and way-finding, which culminate in the state of being oriented to the whole habitat and knowing where one is in the environment.

A place persists in some respects and changes in others. In one respect, it cannot be changed at all-in its location relative to other places. A place cannot be displaced like an object. That is, the adjacent order of places cannot be permuted; they cannot be shuffled. The sleeping places, eating places, meeting 230 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

places, hiding places, and falling-off places of the habitat are immobile. Place- learning is therefore different from other kinds.

Attached Objects

I defined an object in Chapter 3 as a substance partially or wholly surrounded by the medium. An object attached to a place is only partly surrounded. It is a protuberance. It cannot be displaced without becoming detached. Nevertheless, it has a surface and enough of a natural boundary to constitute a unit. Attached objects can thus be counted. Animals and children learn what such objects are good for and how to distinguish them. But they cannot be separated from the places where they are found.

Detached Objects

A fully detached object can be displaced or, in some cases, can displace itself. Learning to perceive it thus has a different character from learning to perceive places and attached objects. Its affordances are different. It can be put side by side with another object and compared. It can therefore be grouped or classed by the manipulation of sorting. Such objects when grouped can be rearranged, that is, permuted. And this means not only that they can be counted but that an abstract number can be assigned to the group.

It is probably harder for a child to perceive "same object in a different place" than it is to perceive "same object in the same place." The former requires that the information for persistence-despite-displacement should have been noticed, whereas the latter does not.

Inanimate detached objects, rigid or nonrigid, natural or manufactured, can be said to have features that distinguish them. The features are probably not denumerable, unlike the objects themselves. But if they are compounded to specify affordances, as I argued they must be, only the relevant compounds need to be distinguished. So when it comes to the natural, nonrigid, animate objects of the world whose dimensions of difference are overwhelmingly rich and complex, we pay attention only to what the animal or person affords (Chapter 8).

Persisting Substances

A substance is that of which places and objects are composed. It can be vaporous, liquid, plastic, viscous, or rigid, that is, increasingly "substantial."A substance, together with what it affords, is fairly well specified by the color and texture of its surface. Smoke, milk, clay, bread, and wood are polymorphic in layout but invariant in color-texture. Substances, of course, can be smelled and tasted and palpated as well as seen. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 231

The animal or child who begins to perceive substances, therefore, does so in a different way than one who begins to perceive places, attached objects, and detached objects. Substances are formless and cannot be counted. The number of substances, natural compositions, or mixtures is not fixed. (The number of chemical elements is fixed, but that is a different matter.) We discriminate among surface colors and textures, but we cannot group them as we do detached objects and we cannot order them as we do places.

We also, of course, perceive changes in otherwise persisting substances, the ripening of fruit, and the results of boiling and baking, or of mixing and hardening. But these are a kind of event.

Events

As I used the term, an event is any change of a substance, place, or object, chem- ical, mechanical, or biophysical. The change may be slow or fast, reversible or nonreversible, repeating or nonrepeating. Events include what happens to objects in general, plus what the animate objects make happen. Events are nested within superordinate events. The motion of a detached object is not the proto- type of an event that we have been led to think it was. Events of different sorts are perceived as such and are not, surely, reducible to elementary motions.

The Information for Perception

Information, as the term is used in this book (but not in other books), refers to specification of the observer's environment, not to specification of the observ- er's receptors or sense organs. The qualities of objects are specified by inform- ation; the qualities of the receptors and nerves are specified by sensations. Information about the world cuts right across the qualities of sense.

The term information cannot have its familiar dictionary meaning of know- ledge communicated to a receiver. This is unfortunate, and I would use another term if I could. The only recourse is to ask the reader to remember that picking up information is not to be thought of as a case of communicating. The world does not speak to the observer. Animals and humans communicate with cries, gestures, speech, pictures, writing, and television, but we cannot hope to understand perception in terms of these channels; it is quite the other way around. Words and pictures convey information, carry it, or transmit it, but the information in the sea of energy around each of us, luminous or mechanical or chemical energy, is not conveyed. It is simply there. The assumption that information can be transmitted and the assumption that it can be stored are appropriate for the theory of communication, not for the theory of perception.

The vast area of speculation about the so-called media of communication had a certain discipline imposed on it some years ago by a mathematical theory of communication (Shannon and Weaver, 1949). A useful measure of information 232 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

transmitted was formulated, in terms of "bits."A sender and receiver, a channel, and a finite number of possible signals were assumed. The result was a genuine discipline of communications engineering. But, although psychologists promptly tried to apply it to the senses and neuropsychologists began thinking of nerve impulses in terms of bits and the brain in terms of a computer, the applications did not work. Shannon's concept of information applies to telephone hookups and radio broadcasting in elegant ways but not, I think, to the firsthand percep- tion of being in-the-world, to what the baby gets when first it opens its eyes. The information for perception, unhappily, cannot be defined and measured as Claude Shannon's information can be.

The information in ambient light, along with sound, odor, touches, and natural chemicals, is inexhaustible. A perceiver can keep on noticing facts about the world she lives in to the end of her life without ever reaching a limit. There is no threshold for information comparable to a stimulus threshold. Information is not lost to the environment when gained by the individual; it is not conserved like energy.

Information is not specific to the banks of photoreceptors, mechanore- ceptors, and chemoreceptors that lie within the sense organs. Sensations are specific to receptors and thus, normally, to the kinds of stimulus energy that touch them off. But information is not energy-specific. Stimuli are not always imposed on a passive subject. In life one obtains stimulation in order to extract the information (Gibson, 19666, Ch. 2). The information can be the same, despite a radical change in the stimulation obtained.

Finally, a concept of information is required that admits of the possibility of illusion. Illusions are a theoretical perplexity in any approach to the study of perception. Is information always valid and illusion simply a failure to pick it up? Or is the information picked up sometimes impoverished, masked, ambiguous, equivocal, contradictory, even false? The puzzle is especially critical in vision.

In Chapter 14 of The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966b) and again in this book I have tried to come to terms with the problem of misperception. I am only sure of this: it is not one problem but a complex of different problems. Consider, first, the mirage of palm trees in the desert sky, or the straight stick that looks bent because it is partly immersed in water. These illusions, together with the illusion of Narcissus, arise from the regular reflection or refraction of light, that is, from exceptions to the ecological optics of the scatter-reflecting surface and the perfectly homogeneous medium. Then consider, second, the misperception in the case of the shark under the calm water or the electric shock hidden in the radio cabinet. Failure to perceive the danger is not then blamed on the perceiver. Consider, third, the sheet of glass mistaken for an open doorway or the horizontal sheet of glass (the optical cliff) mistaken for a void. A fourth case is the room composed of trapezoidal surfaces or the trapezoidal window, which look normally rectangular so long as the observer does not open both eyes and walk around. Optical misinformation The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 233 enters into each of these cases in a different way. But in the last analysis, are they explained by misinformation? Or is it a matter of failure to pick up all the avail- able information, the inexhaustible reservoir that lies open to further scrutiny?

The misperceiving of affordances is a serious matter. As I noted in Chapter 8, a wildcat may look like a cat. (But does he look just like a cat?) A malevolent man may act like a benevolent one. (But does he exactly?) The line between the pickup of misinformation and the failure to pick up information is hard to draw.

Consider the human habit of picture-making, which I take to be the devising and displaying of opticalinformation for perception by others. It is thus a means of communication, giving rise to mediated apprehension, but it is more like direct pickup than word-making is. Depiction and its consequences are deferred until later, but it can be pointed out here that picture-makers have been exper- imenting on us for centuries with artificial displays of information in a special form. They enrich or impoverish it, mask or clarify it, ambiguate or disambig- uate it. They often try to produce a discrepancy of information, an equivoca- tion or contradiction, in the same display. Painters invented the cues for depth in the first place, and psychologists looked at their paintings and began to talk about cues. The notions of counterbalanced cues, of figure-ground reversals, of equivocal perspectives, of different perspectives on the same object, of "impos- sible"objects-all these come from artists who were simply experimenting with frozen optical information.

An important fact to be noted about any pictorial display of optical inform- ation is that, in contrast with the inexhaustible reservoir of information in an illuminated medium, it cannot be looked at close up. Information to specify the display as such, the canvas, the surface, the screen, can always be picked up by an observer who walks around and looks closely.

The Concept of a Perceptual System

The theory of information pickup requires perceptual systems, not senses. Some years ago I tried to prove that a perceptual system was radically different from a sense (Gibson, 1966b), the one being active and the other passive. People said, "Well, what I mean by a sense is an active sense."But it turned out that they still meant the passive inputs of a sensory nerve, the activity being what occurs in the brain when the inputs get there. That was not what I meant by a percep- tual system. I meant the activities of looking, listening, touching, tasting, or sniffing. People then said, "Well, but those are responses to sights, sounds, touches, tastes, or smells, that is, motor acts resulting from sensory inputs. What you call a perceptual system is nothing but a case of feedback." I was discour- aged. People did not understand.

I shall here make another attempt to show that the senses considered as special senses cannot be reconciled with the senses considered as perceptual systems. The five perceptual systems correspond to five modes of overt attention. They 234 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

have overlapping functions, and they are all more or less subordinated to an overall orienting system. A system has organs, whereas a sense has receptors. A system can orient, explore, investigate, adjust, optimize, resonate, extract, and come to an equilibrium, whereas a sense cannot. The characteristic activities of the visual system have been described in Chapter 12 of this book. The charac- teristic activities of the auditory system, the haptic system, and the two related parts of what I called the "chemical value system"were described in Chapters 5-8 of my earlier book (Gibson, 1966b). Five fundamental differences between a sense and a perceptual system are given below.

1. A special sense is defined by a bank of receptors or receptive units that are connected with a so-called projection center in the brain. Local stimuli at the sensory surface will cause local firing of neurons in the center. The adjust- ments of the organ in which the receptors are incorporated are not included within the definition of a sense.

A perceptual system is defined by an organ and its adjustments at a given level of functioning, subordinate or superordinate. At any level, the incoming and outgoing nerve fibers are considered together so as to make a continuous loop.

The organs of the visual system, for example, from lower to higher are roughly as follows. First, the lens, pupil, chamber, and retina comprise an organ. Second, the eye with its muscles in the orbit comprise an organ that is both stabilized and mobile. Third, the two eyes in the head comprise a binocular organ. Fourth, the eyes in a mobile head that can turn comprise an organ for the pickup of ambient information. Fifth, the eyes in a head on a body constitute a superordinate organ for information pickup over paths of locomotion. The adjustments of accommodation, intensity modulation, and dark adaptation go with the first level. The movements of compensation, fixation, and scanning go with the second level. The movements of vergence and the pickup of disparity go with the third level. The movements of the head, and of the body as a whole. go with the fourth and fifth levels. All of them serve the pickup of information.

2. In the case of a special sense, the receptors can only receive stimuli, pass- ively, whereas in the case of a perceptual system the input-output loop can be supposed to obtain information, actively. Even when the theory of the special senses is liberalized by the modern hypothesis of receptive units, the latter are supposed to be triggered by complex stimuli or modulated in some passive fashion.

3. The inputs of a special sense constitute a repertory of innate sensations, whereas the achievements of a perceptual system are susceptible to maturation and learning. Sensations of one modality can be combined with those of another in accordance with the laws of association: they can be organized or fused or supplemented or selected, but no new sensations can be learned. The information that is picked up, on the other hand, becomes more and more subtle, elaborate, and precise with practice. One can keep on learning to perceive as long as life goes on. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 235

4. The inputs of the special senses have the qualities of the receptors being stimulated, whereas the achievements of the perceptual systems are specific to the qualities of things in the world, especially their affordances. The recogni- tion of this limitation of the senses was forced upon us by Johannes Müller with his doctrine of specific "nerve energies."He understood clearly, if reluctantly, the implication that, because we can never know the external causes of our sensations, we cannot know the outer world. Strenuous efforts have to be made if one is to avoid this shocking conclusion. Helmholtz argued that we must deduce the causes of our sensations because we cannot detect them. The hypo- thesis that sensations provide clues or cues for perception of the world is similar. The popular formula that we can interpret sensory signals is a variant of it. But it seems to me that all such arguments come down to this: we can perceive the world only if we already know what there is to be perceived. And that, of course, is circular. I shall come back to this point again.

The alternative is to assume that sensations triggered by light, sound, pres- sure, and chemicals are merely incidental, that information is available to a perceptual system, and that the qualities of the world in relation to the needs of the observer are experienced directly.

5. In the case of a special sense the process of attention occurs at centers within the nervous system, whereas in the case of a perceptual system attention pervades the whole input-output loop. In the first case attention is a conscious- ness that can be focused; in the second case it is a skill that can be educated. In the first case physiological metaphors are used, such as the filtering of nervous impulses or the switching of impulses from one path to another. In the second case the metaphors used can be terms such as resonating, extracting, optimizing, or symmetricalizing and such acts as orienting, exploring, investigating, or adjusting.

I suggested in Chapter 12 that a normal act of visual attention consists of scanning a whole feature of the ambient array, not of fixating a single detail of the array. We are tempted to think of attention as strictly a narrowing-down and holding-still, but actually this is rare. The invariants of structure in an optic array that constitute information are more likely to be gradients than small details, and they are scanned over wide angles.

The Registering of Both Persistence and Change

The theory of information pickup requires that the visual system be able to detect both persistence and change-the persistence of places, objects, and substances along with whatever changes they undergo. Everything in the world persists in some respects and changes in some respects. So also does the observer himself. And some things persist for long intervals, others for short.

The perceiving of persistence and change (instead of color, form, space, time, and motion) can be stated in various ways. We can say that the perceiver separates the change from the nonchange, notices what stays the same and what 236 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

does not, or sees the continuing identity of things along with the events in which they participate. The question, of course, is how he does so. What is the information for persistence and change? The answer must be of this sort: The perceiver extracts the invariants of structure from the flux of stimulation while still noticing the flux. For the visual system in particular, he tunes in on the invariant structure of the ambient optic array that underlies the changing perspective structure caused by his movements.

The hypothesis that invariance under optical transformation constitutes information for the perception of a rigid persisting object goes back to the moving- shadow experiment (Gibson and Gibson, 1957). The outcome of that experiment was paradoxical; it seemed at the time that a changing form elicited the perception of a constant form with a changing slant. The solution was to postulate invariants of optical structure for the persisting object, "formless"invariants, and a particular disturbance of optical structure for the motion of the object, a perspective trans- formation. Separate terms needed to be devised for physical motions and for the optical motions that specified them, for events in the world and for events in the array, for geometry did not provide the terms. Similarly, different terms need to be invented to describe invariants of the changing world and invariants of the changing array; the geometrical word form will not do. Perhaps the best policy is to use the terms persistence and change to refer to the environment but preservation and disturbance of structure to refer to the optic array.

The stimulus-sequence theory of perception, based on a succession of discrete eye fixations, can assume only that the way to apprehend persistence is by an act of comparison and judgment. The perception of what-it-is-now is compared with the memory of what-it-was-then, and they are judged same. The continuous pickup theory of perception can assume that the apprehension of persistence is a simple act of invariance detection. Similarly, the snapshot theory must assume that the way to apprehend change is to compare what-it- is-now with what-it-was-then and judge different, whereas the pickup theory can assume an awareness of transformation. The congruence of the array with itself or the disparity of the array with itself, as the case may be, is picked up.

The perception of the persisting identity of things is fundamental to other kinds of perception. Consider an example, the persisting identity of another person. How does a child come to apprehend the identity of the mother? You might say that when the mother-figure, or the face, is continually fixated by the child the persistence of the sensation is supported by the continuing stimulus. So it is when the child clings to the mother. But what if the mother-figure is scanned? What if the figure leaves and returns to the field of view? What if the figure goes away and comes back? What is perceived when it emerges from the distance or from darkness, when its back is turned, when its clothing is changed, when its emotional state is altered, when it comes back into sight after a long interval? In short, how is it that the phenomenal identity of a person agrees so well with the biological identity, despite all the vicissitudes of the figure in the optic array and all the events in which the person participates? The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 237

The same questions can be asked about inanimate objects, attached objects, places, and substances. The features of a person are invariant to a considerable degree (the eyes, nose, mouth, style of gesture, and voice). But so are the analogous features of other things, the child's blanket, the kitchen stove, the bedroom, and the bread on the table. All have to be identified as continuing, as persisting, as maintaining existence. And this is not explained by the constructing of a concept for each.

We are accustomed to assuming that successive stimuli from the same entity, sensory encounters with it, are united by an act of recognition. We have assumed that perception ceases and memory takes over when sensation stops. Hence, every fresh glimpse of anything requires the act of linking it up with the memories of that thing instead of some other thing. The judgment, "I have seen this before," is required for the apprehension of "same thing,"even when the observer has only turned away, or has only glanced away for an instant. The classical theory of sense perception is reduced to an absurdity by this require- ment. The alternative is to accept the theory of invariance detection.

THE EFFECT OF PERSISTING STIMULATION

ON PERCEPTION

We have assumed that perception stops when sensation stops and that

sensation stops when stimulation stops, or very soon thereafter. Hence, a

persisting stimulus is required for the perception of a persisting object. The

fact is, however, that a truly persisting stimulus on the retina or the skin

specifies only that the observer does not or cannot move his eye or his limb,

and the sense perception soon fades out by sensory adaptation (Chapter 4).

The persistence of an object is specified by invariants of structure, not by the

persistence of stimulation.

The seeing of persistence considered as the picking up of invariants under

change resolves an old puzzle: the phenomenal identity of the spots of a

retinal pattern when the image is transposed over the retina stroboscopically.

The experiments of Josef Ternus first made this puzzle evident. See Gibson

(1950, pp. 56 ff.) for a discussion and references.

I used to think that the aftereffects of persisting stimulation of the retina

obtained by the prolonged fixation of a display could be very revealing.

Besides ordinary afterimages there are all sorts of perceptual aftereffects, some

of which I discovered. But I no longer believe that experiments on so-called

perceptual adaptation are revealing, and I have given up theorizing about

them. The aftereffects of prolonged scrutiny are of many sorts. Until we know

more about information pickup, this field of investigation will be incoherent. 238 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The quality of familiarity that can go with the perception of a place, object, or person, as distinguished from the quality of unfamiliarity, is a fact of experi- ence. But is familiarity a result of the percept making contact with the traces of past percepts of the same thing? Is unfamiliarity a result of not making such contact? I think not. There is a circularity in the reasoning, and it is a bad theory. The quality of familiarity simply accompanies the perception of persistence.

The perception of the persisting identity of places and objects is more funda- mental than the perception of the differences among them. We are told that to perceive something is to categorize it, to distinguish it from the other types of things that it might have been. The essence of perceiving is discriminating. Things differ among themselves, along dimensions of difference. But this leaves out of account the simple fact that the substance, place, object, person, or what- ever has to last long enough to be distinguished from other substances, places, objects, or persons. The detecting of the invariant features of a persisting thing should not be confused with the detecting of the invariant features that make different things similar. Invariants over time and invariants over entities are not grasped in the same way.

In the case of the persisting thing, I suggest, the perceptual system simply extracts the invariants from the flowing array; it resonates to the invariant struc- ture or is attuned to it. In the case of substantially distinct things, I venture, the perceptual system must abstract the invariants. The former process seems to be simpler than the latter, more nearly automatic. The latter process has been interpreted to imply an intellectual act of lifting out something that is mental from a collection of objects that are physical, of forming an abstract concept from concrete percepts, but that is very dubious. Abstraction is invariance detection across objects. But the invariant is only a similarity, not a persistence. Summary of the Theory of Pickup

According to the theory being proposed, perceiving is a registering of certain definite dimensions of invariance in the stimulus flux together with definite parameters of disturbance. The invariants are invariants of structure, and the disturbances are disturbances of structure. The structure, for vision, is that of the ambient optic array.

The invariants specify the persistence of the environment and of oneself. The disturbances specify the changes in the environment and of oneself. A perceiver is aware of her existence in a persisting environment and is also aware of her movements relative to the environment, along with the motions of objects and nonrigid surfaces relative to the environment. The term awareness is used to imply a direct pickup of the information, not necessarily to imply consciousness.

There are many dimensions of invariance in an ambient optic array over time, that is, for paths of observation. One invariant, for example, is caused by The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 239 the occluding edge of the nose, and it specifies the self. Another is the gradient of optical texture caused by the material texture of the substratum, and it spec- ifies the basic environment. Equally, there are many parameters of disturbance of an ambient optic array. One, for example, is caused by the sweeping of the nose over the ambient optic array, and it specifies head turning. Another is the deletion and accretion of texture at the edges of a form in the array, and it specifies the motion of an object over the ground.

For different kinds of events in the world there are different parameters of optical disturbance, not only accretion-deletion but also polar outflow-inflow, compression, transformation, substitution, and others. Hence, the same object can be seen undergoing different events, and different objects can be seen undergoing the same event. For example, an apple may ripen, fall, collide, roll, or be eaten, and eating may happen to an apple, carrot, egg, biscuit, or lamb chop. If the parameter of optical disturbance is distinguished, the event will be perceived. Note how radically different this is from saying that if stimulus- event A is invariably followed by stimulus-event B we will come to expect B whenever we experience A. The latter is classical association theory (or condi- tioning theory, or expectancy theory). It rests on the stimulus-sequence doctrine. It implies that falling, colliding, rolling, or eating are not units but sequences. It implies, with David Hume, that even if B has followed Aa thou- sand times there is no certainty that it will follow A in the future. An event is only known by a conjunction of atomic sensations, a contingency. If this recur- rent sequence is experienced again and again, the observer will begin to anti- cipate, or have faith, or learn by induction, but that is the best he can do.

The process of pickup is postulated to depend on the input-output loop of a perceptual system. For this reason, the information that is picked up cannot be the familiar kind that is transmitted from one person to another and that can be stored. According to pickup theory, information does not have to be stored in memory because it is always available.

The process of pickup is postulated to be very susceptible to development and learning. The opportunities for educating attention, for exploring and adjusting, for extracting and abstracting are unlimited. The increasing capacity of a perceptual system to pick up information, however, does not in itself constitute information. The ability to perceive does not imply, necessarily, the having of an idea of what can be perceived. The having of ideas is a fact, but it is not a prerequisite of perceiving. Perhaps it is a kind of extended perceiving. The Traditional Theories of Perception: Input Processing

The theory of information pickup purports to be an alternative to the tradi- tional theories of perception. It differs from all of them, I venture to suggest, in rejecting the assumption that perception is the processing of inputs. Inputs mean sensory or afferent nerve impulses to the brain. 240 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Adherents to the traditional theories of perception have recently been making the claim that what they assume is the processing of information in a modern sense of the term, not sensations, and that therefore they are not bound by the traditional theories of perception. But it seems to me that all they are doing is climbing on the latest bandwagon, the computer bandwagon, without reappraising the traditional assumption that perceiving is the processing of inputs. I refuse to let them pre-empt the term information. As I use the term, it is not something that has to be processed. The inputs of the receptors have to be processed, of course, because they in themselves do not specify anything more than the anatomical units that are triggered.

All kinds of metaphors have been suggested to describe the ways in which sensory inputs are processed to yield perceptions. It is supposed that sensation occurs first, perception occurs next, and knowledge occurs last, a progression from the lower to the higher mental processes. One process is the filtering of sensory inputs. Another is the organizing of sensory inputs, the grouping of elements into a spatial pattern. The integrating of elements into a temporal pattern may or may not be included in the organizing process. After that, the processes become highly speculative. Some theorists propose mental opera- tions. Others argue for semilogical processes or problem-solving. Many theor- ists are in favor of a process analogous to the decoding of signals. All theorists seem to agree that past experience is brought to bear on the sensory inputs, which means that memories are somehow applied to them. Apart from filtering and organizing, the processes suggested are cognitive. Consider some of them. Mental Operations on the Sensory Inputs

The a priori categories of understanding possessed by the perceived, according to Kant

The perceiver's presuppositions about what is being perceived

Innate ideas about the world

Semilogical Operations on the Sensory Inputs

Unconscious inferences about the outer causes of the sensory inputs, according to Helmholtz (the outer world is deduced)

Estimates of the probable character of the "distant"objects based on the proximal"stimuli, according to Egon Brunswik (1956), said to be a quasira- tional, not a fully rational, process

Decoding Operations on the Sensory Inputs

The interpreting of the inputs considered as signals (a very popular analogy with many variants) The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 241 The decoding of sensory messages

The utilizing of sensory cues

The understanding of signs, or indicators, or even clues, in the manner of a police detective

The Application of Memories to the Sensory Inputs

The"accrual"of a context of memory images and feelings to the core of sensa- tions, according to E. B. Titchener's theory of perception (1924).

This last hypothetical process is perhaps the most widely accepted of all, and the most elaborated. Perceptual learning is supposed to be a matter of enriching the input, not of differentiating the information (Gibson and Gibson, 1955). But the process of combining memories with inputs turns out to be not at all simple when analyzed. The appropriate memories have to be retrieved from storage, that is, aroused or summoned; an image does not simply accrue. The sensory input must fuse in some fashion with the stored images; or the sensory input is assimilated to a composite memory image, or, if this will not do, it is said to be assimilated to a class, a type, a schema, or a concept. Each new sensory input must be categorized- assigned to its class, matched to its type, fitted to its schema, and so on. Note that categories cannot become established until enough items have been classified but that items cannot be classified until categories have been established. It is this diffi- culty, for one, that compels some theorists to suppose that classification is a priori and that people and animals have innate or instinctive knowledge of the world.

The error lies, it seems to me, in assuming that either innate ideas or acquired ideas must be applied to bare sensory inputs for perceiving to occur. The fallacy is to assume that because inputs convey no knowledge they can somehow be made to yield knowledge by "processing"them. Knowledge of the world must come from somewhere; the debate is over whether it comes from stored know- ledge, from innate knowledge, or from reason. But all three doctrines beg the question. Knowledge of the world cannot be explained by supposing that knowledge of the world already exists. All forms of cognitive processing imply cognition so as to account for cognition.

All this should be treated as ancient history. Knowledge of the environment, surely, develops as perception develops, extends as the observers travel, gets finer as they learn to scrutinize, gets longer as they apprehend more events, gets fuller as they see more objects, and gets richer as they notice more affordances. Knowledge of this sort does not "come from" anywhere; it is got by looking, along with listening, feeling, smelling, and tasting. The child also, of course, begins to acquire knowledge that comes from parents, teachers, pictures, and books. But this is a different kind of knowledge.

The False Dichotomy between Present and Past Experience

The division between present experience and past experience may seem to be self-evident. How could anyone deny it? Yet it is denied in supposing that we can experience both change and nonchange. The difference between present and past blurs, and the clarity of the distinction slips away. The stream of exper- ience does not consist of an instantaneous present and a linear past receding into the distance; it is not a "traveling razor's edge" dividing the past from the future. Perhaps the present has a certain duration. If so, it should be possible to find out when perceiving stops and remembering begins. But it has not been possible. There are attempts to talk about a "conscious"present, or a "specious"present, or a "span" of present perception, or a span of "immediate memory," but they all founder on the simple fact that there is no dividing line between the present and the past, between perceiving and remembering. A special sense impression clearly ceases when the sensory excitation ends, but a perception does not. It does not become a memory after a certain length of time. A perception, in fact. does not have an end. Perceiving goes on.

Perhaps the force of the dichotomy between present and past experience comes from language, where we are not allowed to say anything intermediate between "I see you" and "I saw you" or "I am seeing you"and "I was seeing you." Verbs can take the present tense or the past tense. We have no words to describe my continuing awareness of you, whether you are in sight or out of sight. Language is categorical. Because we are led to separate the present from the past, we find ourselves involved in what I have called the "muddle of memory" (Gibson, 1966a). We think that the past ceases to exist unless it is"preserved"in memory. We assume that memory is the bridge between the past and the present. We assume that memories accumulate and are stored somewhere; that they are images, or pictures, or representations of the past; or that memory is actually physiological, not mental, consisting of engrams or traces; or that it actually consists of neural connections. not engrams: that memory is the basis of all learning; that memory is the basis of habit; that memories live on in the uncon- scious: that heredity is a form of memory: that cultural heredity is another form of memory; that any effect of the past on the present is memory, including hyster- esis. If we cannot do any better than this, we should stop using the word. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 243

The traditional theories of perception take it for granted that what we see now, present experience, is the sensory basis of our perception of the environment and that what we have seen up to now, past experience, is added to it. We can only understand the present in terms of the past. But what we see now (when it is carefully analyzed) turns out to be at most a peculiar set of surfaces that happen to come within the field of view and face the point of observation (Chapter 11). It does not comprise what we see. It could not possibly be the basis of our perception of the environment. What we see now refers to the self, not the environment. The perspective appearance of the world at a given moment of time is simply what specifies to the observer where he is at that moment. The perceptual process does not begin with this peculiar projection, this momentary pattern. The perceiving of the world begins with the pickup of invariants.

Evidently the theory of information pickup does not need memory. It does not have to have as a basic postulate the effect of past experience on present experience by way of memory. It needs to explain learning, that is, the improve- ment of perceiving with practice and the education of attention, but not by an appeal to the catch-all of past experience or to the muddle of memory.

The state of a perceptual system is altered when it is attuned to information of a certain sort. The system has become sensitized. Differences are noticed that were previously not noticed. Features become distinctive that were formerly vague. But this altered state need not be thought of as depending on a memory, an image, an engram, or a trace. An image of the past, if experienced at all, would be only an incidental symptom of the altered state.

This is not to deny that reminiscence, expectation, imagination, fantasy, and dreaming actually occur. It is only to deny that they have an essential role to play in perceiving. They are kinds of visual awareness other than perceptual. Let us now consider them in their own right.

A New Approach to Nonperceptual Awareness

The redefinition of perception implies a redefinition of the so-called higher mental processes. In the old mentalistic psychology, they stood above the lower mental processes, the sensory and reflex processes, which could be understood in terms of the physiology of receptors and nerves. These higher processes were vaguely supposed to be intellectual processes, inasmuch as the intellect was contrasted with the senses. They occurred in the brain. They were operations of the mind. No list of them was ever agreed upon, but remembering, thinking, conceiving, infer- ring, judging, expecting, and, above all, knowing were the words used. Imagining, dreaming, rationalizing, and wishful thinking were also recognized, but it was not clear that they were higher processes in the intellectual sense. I am convinced that none of them can ever be understood as an operation of the mind. They will never be understood as reactions of the body, either. But perhaps if they are 244 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

reconsidered in relation to ecological perceiving they will begin to sort them- selves out in a new and reasonable way that fits with the evidence.

To perceive is to be aware of the surfaces of the environment and of oneself in it. The interchange between hidden and unhidden surfaces is essential to this awareness. These are existing surfaces; they are specified at some points of observation. Perceiving gets wider and finer and longer and richer and fuller as the observer explores the environment. The full awareness of surfaces includes their layout, their substances, their events, and their affordances. Note how this definition includes within perception a part of memory, expectation, know- ledge, and meaning-some part but not all of those mental processes in each case.

One kind of remembering, then, would be an awareness of surfaces that have ceased to exist or events that will not recur, such as items in the story of one's own life. There is no point of observation at which such an item will come into sight.

To expect, anticipate, plan, or imagine creatively is to be aware of surfaces that do not exist or events that do not occur but that could arise or be fabricated within what we call the limits of possibility.

To daydream, dream, or imagine wishfully (or fearfully) is to be aware of surfaces or events that do not exist or occur and that are outside the limits of possibility.

These three kinds of nonperceptual awareness are not explained, I think, by the traditional hypothesis of mental imagery. They are better explained by some such hypothesis as this: a perceptual system that has become sensitized to certain invariants and can extract them from the stimulus flux can also operate without the constraints of the stimulus flux. Information becomes further detached from stimulation. The adjustment loops for looking around, looking at, scanning, and focusing are then inoperative. The visual system visualizes. But this is still an activity of the system, not an appearance in the theater of consciousness.

Besides these, other kinds of cognitive awareness occur that are not strictly perceptual. Before considering them, however, I must clarify what I mean by imaginary or unreal.

The Relationship between Imagining and Perceiving

I assume that a normal observer is well aware of the difference between surfaces that exist and surfaces that do not. (Those that do not have ceased to exist, or have not begun to, or have not and will not. How can this be so? What is the information for existence? What are the criteria? It is widely believed that young children are not aware of the differences, and neither are adults suffering from hallucinations. They do not distinguish between what is "real"and what is "imaginary" because perception and mental imagery cannot be separated. This doctrine rests on the assumption that, because a percept and an image both The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 245 occur in the brain, the one can pass over into the other by gradual steps. The only "tests for reality"are intellectual. A percept cannot validate itself.

We have been told ever since John Locke that an image is a"faint copy"of a percept. We are told by Titchener(1924) that an image is "easily confused with a sensation"(p. 198). His devoted student, C. W. Perky, managed to show that a faint optical picture secretly projected from behind on a translucent screen is sometimes not identified as such when an observer is imagining an object of the same sort on the screen(Perky, 1910). We are told by a famous neurosurgeon that electrical stimulation of the surface of the brain in a conscious patient "has the force" of an actual perception (Penfield, 1958). It is said that when a feeling of reality accompanies a content of consciousness it is marked as a percept and when it does not it is marked as an image. All these assertions are extremely dubious

I suggest that perfectly reliable and automatic tests for reality are involved in the working of a perceptual system. They do not have to be intellectual. A surface is seen with more or less definition as the accommodation of the lens changes; an image is not. A surface becomes clearer when fixated: an image does not. A surface can be scanned; an image cannot. When the eyes converge on an object in the world, the sensation of crossed diplopia disappears, and when the eyes diverge, the "double image"reappears; this does not happen for an image in the space of the mind. An object can be scrutinized with the whole repertory of optimizing adjustments described in Chapter 11. No image can be scrutinized- not an afterimage, not a so-called eidetic image, not the image in a dream, and not even a hallucination. An imaginary object can undergo an imaginary scrutiny, no doubt, but you are not going to discover a new and surprising feature of the object this way. For it is the very features of the object that your perceptual system has already picked up that constitute your ability to visualize it. The most decisive test for reality is whether you can discover new features and details by the act of scrutiny. Can you obtain new stimulation and extract new information from it? Is the information inexhaustible? Is there more to be seen? The imaginary scrutiny of an imaginary entity cannot pass this test.

A related criterion for the existence of a thing is reversible occlusion. Whatever goes out of sight as you move your head and comes into sight as you move back is a persisting surface. Whatever comes into sight when you move your head is a preexisting surface. That is to say, it exists. The present, past, or future tense of the verb see is irrelevant: the fact is perceived without words. Hence, a criterion for real versus imaginary is what happens when you turn and move. When the infant turns her head and creeps about and brings her hands in and out of her field of view, she perceives what is real. The assumption that children cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is imaginary until the intellect develops is mentalistic nonsense. As the child grows up, she apprehends more reality as she visits more places of her habitat.

Nevertheless, it is argued that dreams sometimes have the "feeling" of reality, that some drugs can induce hallucinations, and that a true hallucination in 246 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

psychosis is proof that a mental image can be the same as a percept, for the patient acts as ifhe were perceiving and thinks he is perceiving. I remain dubious (Gibson, 1970). The dreamer is asleep and cannot make the ordinary tests for reality. The drug-taker is hoping for a vision and does not want to make tests for reality. There are many possible reasons why the hallucinating patient does not scrutinize what he says he sees, does not walk around it or take another look at it or test it.

There is a popular fallacy to the effect that if you can touch what you see it is real. The sense of touch is supposed to be more trustworthy than the sense of sight, and Bishop Berkeley's theory of vision was based on this idea. But it is surely wrong. Tactual hallucinations can occur as well as visual. And if the senses are actually perceptual systems, the haptic system as I described it (Gibson, 1966b) has its own exploratory adjustments and its own automatic tests for reality. One perceptual system does not validate another. Seeing and touching are two ways of getting much the same information about the world. A New Approach to Knowing

The theory of information pickup makes a clear-cut separation between perception and fantasy, but it closes the supposed gap between perception and knowledge. The extracting and abstracting of invariants are what happens in both perceiving and knowing. To perceive the environment and to conceive it are different in degree but not in kind. One is continuous with the other. Our reasons for supposing that seeing something is quite unlike knowing something come from the old doctrine that seeing is having temporary sensations one after another at the passing moment of present time, whereas knowing is having permanent concepts stored in memory. It should now be clear that perceptual seeing is an awareness of persisting structure.

Knowing is an extension of perceiving. The child becomes aware of the world by looking around and looking at, by listening, feeling, smelling, and tasting, but then she begins to be made aware of the world as well. She is shown things, and told things, and given models and pictures of things, and then instruments and tools and books, and finally rules and short cuts for finding out more things. Toys, pictures, and words are aids to perceiving, provided by parents and teachers. They transmit to the next generation the tricks of the human trade. The labors of the first perceivers are spared their descendants. The extracting and abstracting of the invariants that specify the environment are made vastly easier with these aids to comprehension. But they are not in themselves knowledge, as we are tempted to think. All they can do is facilitate knowing by the young.

These extended or aided modes of apprehension are all cases of information pickup from a stimulus flux. The learner has to hear the speech in order to pick up the message; to see the model, the picture, or the writing; to manipulate the instrument in order to extract the information. But the information itself is largely independent of the stimulus flux. The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 247

What are the kinds of culturally transmitted knowledge? I am uncertain, for they have not been considered at this level of description. Present-day discussions of the "media of communication" seem to me glib and superficial. I suspect that there are many kinds merging into one another, of great complexity. But I can think of three obvious ways to facilitate knowing, to aid perceiving, or to extend the limits of comprehension: the use of instruments, the use of verbal descriptions, and the use of pictures. Words and pictures work in a different way than do instruments, for the information is obtained at second hand. Consider them separately.

Knowing Mediated by Instruments

Surfaces and events that are too small or too far away cannot be perceived. You can of course increase the visual solid angle if you approach the item and put your eye close to it, but that procedure has its limits. You cannot approach the moon by walking, and you cannot get your eye close enough to a drop of pond water to see the little animals swimming in it. What can be done is to enlarge the visual solid angle from the moon or the water drop. You can convert a tiny sample of the ambient optic array at a point of observation into a magnified sample by means of a telescope or a microscope. The structure of the sample is only a little distorted. The surfaces perceived when the eye is placed at the eyepiece are "virtual" instead of "real," but only in the special sense that they are very much closer to the observer. The invariants of structure are nearly the same when a visual angle with its nested components is magnified. This descrip- tion of magnification comes from ecological optics. For designing the lens system of the instrument, a different optics is needed.

The discovery of these instruments in the seventeenth century enabled men to know much more about very large bodies and very small bodies than they had before. But this new knowledge was almost like seeing. The mountains of the moon and the motions of a living cell could be observed with adjustments of the instrument not unlike those of the head and eyes. The guarantees of reality were similar. You did not have to take another person's word for what he had seen. You might have to learn to use the instrument, but you did not have to learn to interpret the information. Nor did you have to judge whether or not the other person was telling the truth. With a telescope or a microscope you could look for yourself.

THE UNAIDED PERCEIVING OF OBJECTS IN THE SKY

Objects in the sky are very different from objects on the ground. The heav-

enly bodies do not come to rest on the ground as ordinary objects do. The 248 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

rainbow and the clouds are transient, forming and dissipating like mists on

earth. But the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars seem permanent,

appearing to revolve around the stationary earth in perfect cycles and

continuing to exist while out of sight. They are immortal and mysterious.

They cannot be scrutinized.

Optical information for direct perception of these bodies with the unaided

eye is lacking. Their size and distance are indeterminate except that they rise

and set from behind the distant horizon and are thus very far away. Their

motions are very different from those of ordinary objects. The character of

their surfaces is indefinite, and of what substances they are composed is not

clear. The sun is fiery by day, and the others are fiery at night, unlike the

textured reflecting surfaces of most terrestrial objects. What they afford is not

visible to the eye. Lights in the sky used to look like gods. Nowadays they

look like flying saucers.

All sorts of instruments have been devised for mediating apprehension. Some optical instruments merely enhance the information that vision is ready to pick up; others-a spectroscope, for example-require some inference; still others, like the Wilson cloud chamber, demand a complex chain of inferences.

Some measuring instruments are closer to perception than others. The measuring stick for counting units of distance, the gravity balance for counting units of mass, and the hourglass for time are easy to understand. But the complex magnitudes of physical science are another matter. The voltmeters, accelero- meters, and photometers are hard to understand. The child can see the pointer and the scale well enough but has to learn to "read" the instrument, as we say. The direct perception of a distance is in terms of whether one can jump it. The direct perception of a mass is in terms of whether one can lift it. Indirect know- ledge of the metric dimensions of the world is a far extreme from direct percep- tion of the affordance dimensions of the environment. Nevertheless, they are both cut from the same cloth.

Knowing Mediated by Descriptions: Explicit Knowledge

The principal way in which we save our children the trouble of finding out everything for themselves is by describing things for them. We transmit inform- ation and convey knowledge. Wisdom is handed down. Parents and teachers and books give the children knowledge of the world at second hand. Instead of having to be extracted by the child from the stimulus flux, this knowledge is communicated to the child.

It is surely true that speech and language convey information of a certain sort from person to person and from parent to child. Written language can even be stored so that it accumulates in libraries. But we should never forget that this The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 249 is information that has been put into words. It is not the limitless information available in a flowing stimulus array.

Knowledge that has been put into words can be said to be explicit instead of tacit. The human observer can verbalize his awareness, and the result is to make it communicable. But my hypothesis is that there has to be an awareness of the world before it can be put into words. You have to see it before you can say it. Perceiving precedes predicating.

In the course of development the young child first hears talk about what she is perceiving. Then she begins herself to talk about what she perceives. Then she begins to talk to herself about what she knows--when she is alone in her crib, for example. And, finally, her verbal system probably begins to verbalize silently, in much the same way that the visual system begins to visualize, without the constraints of stimulation or muscular action but within the limits of the invari- ants to which the system is attuned. But no matter how much the child puts knowledge into words all of it cannot be put into words. However skilled an explicator one may become one will always, I believe, see more than one can say.

Consider an adult, a philosopher, for example, who sees the cat on the mat. He knows that the cat is on the mat and believes the proposition and can say it, but all the time he plainly sees all sorts of wordless facts-the mat extending without interruption behind the cat, the far side of the cat, the cat hiding part of the mat, the edges of the cat, the cat being supported by the mat, or resting on it, the horizontal rigidity of the floor under the mat, and so on. The so-called concepts of extension, of far and near, gravity, rigidity, horizontal, and so on, are nothing but partial abstractions from a rich but unitary perception of cat- on-mat. The parts of it he can name are called concepts, but they are not all of what he can see.

Fact and Fiction in Words and Pictures

Information about the environment that has been put into words has this disad- vantage: The reality testing that accompanies the pickup of naturalinformation is missing. Descriptions, spoken or written, do not permit the flowing stimulus array to be scrutinized. The invariants have already been extracted. You have to trust the original perceiver; you must "take his word for it,"as we say. What he presents may be fact, or it may be fiction. The same is true of a depiction as of a description.

The child, as I argued above, has no difficulty in contrasting real and imaginary, and the two do not merge. But the factual and the fictional may do so. In storytelling, adults do not always distinguish between true stories and fairy stories. The child herself does not always separate the giving of an account from the telling of a story. Tigers and dragons are both fascinating beasts, and the child will not learn the difference until she perceives that the zoo contains the former but not the latter. 250 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Fictions are not necessarily fantasies. They do not automatically lead one astray, as hallucinations do. They can promote creative plans. They can permit vicarious learning when the child identifies with a fictional character who solves problems and makes errors. The "comic"characters of childhood, the funny and the foolish, the strong and the weak, the clever and the stupid, occupy a great part of children's cognitive awareness, but this does not interfere in the least with their realism when it comes to perceiving.

The difference between the real and the imaginary is specified by two different modes of operation of a perceptual system. But the difference between the factual and the fictional depends on the social system of communication and brings in complicated questions. Verbal descriptions can be true or false as predications. Visual depictions can be correct or incorrect in a wholly different way. A picture cannot be true in the sense that a proposition is true, but it may or may not be true to life.

Knowing and Imagining Mediated by Pictures

Perceiving, knowing, recalling, expecting, and imagining can all be induced by pictures, perhaps even more readily than by words. Picture-making and picture- perceiving have been going on for twenty or thirty thousand years of human life, and this achievement, like language, is ours alone. The image makers can arouse in us an awareness of what they have seen, of what they have noticed, of what they recall, expect, or imagine, and they do so without converting the inform- ation into a different mode. The description puts the optical invariants into words. The depiction, however, captures and displays them in an optic array,where they are more or less the same as they would be in the case of direct perception. So I will argue, at least. The justification of this theory is obviously not a simple matter, and it is deferred to the last chapters of this book, Part IV.

The reality-testing that accompanies unmediated perceiving and that is partly retained in perceiving with instruments is obviously lost in the kind of perceiving that is mediated by pictures. Nevertheless, pictures give us a kind of grasp on the rich complexities of the natural environment that words could never do. Pictures do not stereotype our experience in the same way and to the same degree. We can learn from pictures with less effort than it takes to learn from words. It is not like perceiving at first hand, but it is more like perceiving than any verbal description can be.

The child who has learned to talk about things and events can, metaphoric- ally, talk to himself silently about things and events, so it is supposed. He is said to have "internalized"his speech, whatever that might mean. By analogy with this theory, a child who has learned to draw might be supposed to picture to himself things and events without movement of his hands, to have "internal- ized"his picturemaking. A theory of internal language and internal images might be based on this theory. But it seems to me very dubious. Whether or not The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences 251 it is plausible is best decided after we have considered picturemaking in its own right.

Summary

When vision is thought of as a perceptual system instead of as a channel for inputs to the brain, a new theory of perception considered as information pickup becomes possible. Information is conceived as available in the ambient energy flux, not as signals in a bundle of nerve fibers. It is information about both the persisting and the changing features of the environment together. Moreover, information about the observer and his movements is available, so that self-awareness accompanies perceptual awareness.

The qualities of visual experience that are specific to the receptors stimu- lated are not relevant to information pickup but incidental to it. Excitation and transmission are facts of physiology at the cellular level.

The process of pickup involves not only overt movements that can be meas- ured, such as orienting, exploring, and adjusting, but also more general activ- ities, such as optimizing, resonating, and extracting invariants, that cannot so easily be measured.

The ecological theory of direct perception cannot stand by itself. It implies a new theory of cognition in general. In turn, that implies a new theory of noncog- nitive kinds of awareness-fictions, fantasies, dreams, and hallucinations.

Perceiving is the simplest and best kind of knowing. But there are other kinds, of which three were suggested. Knowing by means of instruments extends perceiving into the realm of the very distant and the very small; it also allows of metric knowledge. Knowing by means of language makes knowing explicit instead of tacit. Language permits descriptions and pools the accumu- lated observations of our ancestors. Knowing by means of pictures also extends perceiving and consolidates the gains of perceiving.

The awareness of imaginary entities and events might be ascribed to the operation of the perceptual system with a suspension of reality-testing. Imagination, as well as knowledge and perception, can be aroused by another person who uses language or makes pictures.

These tentative proposals are offered as a substitute for the outworn theory of past experience, memory, and mental images. This page intentionally left blank PART IV

## 15. Pictures and Visual Awareness



Having rejected the picture theory of natural perception, we can make a start on picture perception. To see the environment is to extract information from the ambient array of light. What is it, then, to see a picture of something? The information in ambient light consists not of forms and colors but of invariants. Is it implied that the information in a picture does not consist of forms and colors but consists of invariants likewise? That sounds very odd, for we suppose that a picture is entirely composed of forms and colors.

The kind of vision we get from pictures is harder to understand than the kind we get from ambient light, not easier. It should be considered at the end of a treatise on perception, not at the beginning. It cannot be omitted, for pictures are as essential a part of human life as words. They are deeply puzzling and endlessly interesting. What are pictures, and what do they do for us? There are obviously two kinds: still pictures and motion pictures. This chapter is concerned with the first and the following chapter with the second. The motion picture is more like natural vision than the still picture, for the latter is an arrested image. The pictorial array is frozen in time and fixed at a single, unmoving point of observation. The cinematic array can display not only the information for seeing events but also that for a moving observer. It is techno- logically complex, however, and we had better treat it later.

The Showing of Drawings and the Study of Perception

For countless centuries, certainly since the cavemen, artists have been making drawings, showing them to their neighbors, and asking what they saw. Sometime around a century ago, psychologists thought of presenting drawings to observers under controlled conditions and finding out what was perceived 256 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

with systematic variation of the drawings. This made the procedure an exper- iment with an independent variable and a dependent variable consisting of the verbal (or other) response. But actually the artist as much as the psychologist, was experimenting with perception all along, even if not formally.

This ancient procedure is easy to carry out, but it is not a good way to begin the study of perception, for the observer is never quite sure how to answer the question, "What do you see?"A drawing does not have ecological validity. I use drawing in a general sense that includes a scribble, a form, or a pattern as well as a picture. It is the procedure that perceptionists use, however, on the assumption that a form on the retina is the basic stimulus and that form perception is the primary kind. A drawn form on paper is also said to be a stimulus, loosely speaking, and thus an experimenter can "apply" it to an animal or a baby as well as an adult. But is this a good way to begin the study of perception?

My own first effort in psychology was an experiment on the perception of drawings (Gibson, 1929)，and I have been puzzling about such experiments ever since. My subjects had to reproduce the figures shown, but one could have them recognized, or matched, or described in words, or completed from a part. One could present line drawings or silhouettes, closed outlines or open, nonsense figures or meaningful ones, regular or irregular forms, simple or complex forms, scribbles or depictions, nameless blobs or specific representa- tions, hen tracks or alphabetic characters, cursive or printed letters, upright or inverted forms, "good" forms or "bad"forms. All these variations and many others have been tried out. The results are disappointing. After hundreds of experiments, nothing decisive has emerged about visual perception, only perplexities. Wherein lies the meaning? Does a drawing have an intrinsic meaning or only an arbitrary meaning? Are there laws of organization that apply or only laws of association? Are there significant forms as such or only forms that represent objects? Can forms represent solid objects or only flat objects, and if the former, how?

Meanwhile, of course. modem artists of various schools have also been experimenting. Their drawings and paintings are said to be nonrepresentative, or nonobjective, or nonfigurative, or sometimes abstract; but the question is, what do we see? The artists, who do not have to worry about explicitness, have tried out a wider range of variations than the psychologists, and we now have a crowd of professional art critics trying to make them explicit. The critics, too, it seems to me, have not made any significant discoveries about visual perception. The old perplexities are unresolved.

The showing of drawings is thought to be a good way to begin the study of perception, because vision is supposed to be simplest when there is a form on the retina that is a copy of a form on a surface facing the retina. The retinal form is then in point-to-point correspondence with the drawn form, although inverted. But this is not the simplest case of vision, as the foregoing chapters Pictures and Visual Awareness 257

have proved. Visual awareness of the surroundings cannot be explained on this supposition. Not even visual awareness of an object in space can be explained by it, because for any given form there exists an infinite set of possible objects in space and for any given solid object that moves there exists an infinite set of possible forms. A frozen form does not specify the solid shape of an object, only some of the invariant features that a solid object must have, as I explained in Chapter 9. And, in any case, we never see just a form; we see a sample of the ambient optic array. If I am right, most of the experiments by psychologists, including the gestalt psychologists, have been irrelevant.

As for the nonobjective painters, they scorn to represent domestic objects, animals, persons, gods, interiors, or landscapes in the old-fashioned way, but they claim that the forms and colors they put on canvas yield a direct experi- ence of "space." What can be meant by that overworked term in this connec- tion? The assertion that a still picture can yield an experience of "motion"is another paradox. Those terms are surely inappropriate in their physicomathem- atical meanings, but is there some truth in the claims?

Vision is simplest when it fulfills its function, not when it meets the criterion of one-to-one projective correspondence in geometry. Its function is to help the observer cope with the environment.

FIGURE 15.1 Projective correspondence. The correspondence of a geometrical form on one plane to a geometrical form on another.

The pencil of so-called rays that connect the two forms point-to-point is indicated only by four lines. In this diagram the common point of intersection of the rays in the pencil is between the planes, and one of the forms is therefore inverted relative to the other. One form is a congruent copy of the other when the two planes are parallel and equidistant from the point, or when they are parallel and the point is at infinity. In the latter case there is no inversion. Note that a pencil of geometrical rays as shown here, a sheaf or bundle of lines, is not the same as a focused pencil of radiating rays as shown in Figure 4.3. Geometrical optics and physical optics are not consistent in this respect. 258 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

What is a Picture?

The science of language is well established, but nothing even approximating a science of depiction exists. What artists, critics, and philosophers of art have to say about pictures has little in common with what photographers, opticists, and geometers have to say about them. They do not seem to be talking about the same topic. No one seems to know what a picture is.

Besides showing pictures to people, I have been trying to formulate a defin- ition of a picture for years, but I have had to change it repeatedly as my optics shifted and my theory of perception developed. Perhaps the abandoned defini- tions will prove interesting as history. They can be found in four essays, only the last of which I would stand by (Gibson, 1954, 1960b, 19666 [Ch. 11], and 1971). The Picture as an Array

All along I have maintained that a picture is a surface so treated that it makes available a limited optic array of some sort at a point of observation. But an array of what? That was the difficulty. My first answer was, an array of pencils of light rays. My second was, an array of visual solid angles, which become nested solid angles after a little thought. My third answer was, an array considered as a structure. And the final answer was, an arrangement of invariants of structure.

1. An array of pencils of light coming to the pupil of an eye such that each corres- ponds in brightness (and hue, if any) to its radiating element of the picture surface. This formula was my early attempt to apply classical optics to a picture. (A pencil of light rays to the pupil is illustrated in Chapter 4, Figure 4.3.) Because each pencil could be reduced to a single line from an element of the picture to the nodal point of the eye, I called the array a "sheaf of rays," as in projective geometry, which was confusing. (See the controversy about this in the Handbook of Perception, Boynton, 1974； Gibson, 1974.) There are many objections to this definition. For one thing, the supposed correspondence of brightness and color between elements of the array and elements of the picture is a great mystery. I was thinking of paintings and photographs that had what I called fidelity to the scene depicted, and the only kind of fidelity I could think of was of elements.

2. An array of nested visual solid angles at the station point determined by steps or contrasts of intensity and spectral composition of the ambient light. This definition is better, because it emphasizes the relations between genuine parts of an array instead of an abstract sheaf of lines intersecting at the eye, each with its point-sensation. The forms on the picture surface are unique and are included within larger forms. The solid angles coming from a picture to its station point are analogous to the solid angles coming from the faces and facets of a layout to a point of observation.

3. An array considered as a stationary structure. This definition is still better, because structure includes gradients, discontinuities, and textures as well as Pictures and Visual Awareness 259

simple contrasts. It begins to be information about an environment, not just stim- ulation. There are relations between relations, for which there are no names and no mathematical expressions. Gradual transitions in the array can specify shadows and curvatures in the world over and beyond the faces and facets of surfaces.

4. An array of persisting invariants of structure that are nameless and formless. This definition is the most general of all. It assumes that some of the invariants of an array can be separated from its perspective structure, not only when the perspective keeps changing, as in life, but also when it is arrested, as in a still picture. This says that formless invariants can be detected in a picture that seems to consist entirely of forms. Ordinarily, these invariants underlie the transformations and emerge most clearly when the persisting properties separate off from the changing properties, but they can also be distinguished in the limiting case of an unchanging structure.

The four essays on picture perception referred to above culminated in a fifth paper devoted to the concept of formless invariants (Gibson, 1973). Despite the argument that because a still picture presents no transformation it can display no invariants under transformation, I ventured to suggest that it did display invariants, even if weaker than those that emerged from a motion picture.

If it is true that the perception of a detached object is not compounded from a series of discrete forms of that obiect but depends instead on the invariant features of that family of forms over time, it follows that an arrested member of that unique family will have at least some of those invariants. If object percep- tion depends on invariant detection instead of form perception, then form perception itself must entail some invariant detection.

This says that when the young child sees the family cat at play the front view, side view, rear view, top view, and so on are not seen, and what gets perceived is the invariant cat. The child does not notice the aspects of perspectives of the cat until he is much older; he just sees the cat rolling over. Hence, when the child first sees a picture of a cat he is prepared to pick up the invariants, and he pays no atten- tion to the frozen perspective of the picture, drawing, photograph, or cartoon. It is not that he sees an abstract cat, or a conceptual cat, or the common features of the class of cats, as some philosophers would have us believe; what he gets is the information for the persistence of that peculiar, furry, mobile layout of surfaces.

When the young child sees the cat run away, he does not notice the small image but sees the far-off cat. Thus, when he sees two adjacent pictures of Felix in the comic book, a large Felix at the bottom of its picture and another small Felix higher up in its picture, he is prepared to perceive the latter as farther off. When he sees the cat half-hidden by the chair, he perceives a partly hidden cat, not a half-cat, and therefore he is prepared to see the same thing in a drawing.

The child never sees a man as a silhouette, or as a cutout like a paper doll, but probably sees a sort of head-body-arms-legs invariant. Consequently, any outline drawing with this invariant is recognized as a man, and the outlines 260 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

tend to be seen as the occluding edges of a man with interchangeable near and far sides. Even when the outlines give way to line segments, as in so-called stick figures, the invariant may still be displayed and the man perceived.

The perceiving of the cat-on-the-mat contains invariants that are not explicit, as I pointed out in the last chapter. But they can be pictured. The gradient of size and the gradient of density of texture are invariants; the horizon considered as the line where sizes and textures diminish to zero is an invariant. There are many kinds of invariants.

To summarize, a picture is a surface so treated that it makes available an optic array of arrested structures with underlying invariants of structure. The cross-sections of the visual angles of the array are forms, but the invariants are formless. The array is delimited, not ambient. The array is arrested in time. except for the case of the motion picture, which will be considered in the next chapter. The surface can be treated in many ways so as to make the array avail- able: by painting or drawing or depositing pigment on it so as to modify its reflectance or its transmittance; by engraving or indenting it so as to make shadows and give relief; or by casting light and shade on it so as to produce a temporary picture, in which case we call the surface a screen and the shadow caster a projector. These fundamental ways of creating an artificial array were discussed in Chapter 11 of my earlier book on perception (Gibson, 1966b). Whatever the artist may do, however, he cannot avoid showing his surface in the midst of other surfaces of an environment. A picture can only be seen in a context of other nonpictorial surfaces.

The enormously complex technologies of picture-making fall into two different types, the photographic methods that are only a hundred and fifty years old and what I like to call the chirographic methods (Gibson, 1954，p. 21) that have been practiced for at least twenty thousand years. The former involve a camera with accessory equipment for the hand-eye system of a human observer, and the latter involve a graphic tool of some sort for the hand-eye system. The invariants made available by these two ways of treating a surface have much in common but are not equivalent, as will be evident in the next section. The photographic picture has a unique, fixed station point in front of the surface. The chirographic picture may or may not have a unique station point, depending on whether or not it was drawn in so-called correct perspective. The actual point of observation will usually not coincide with the unique station point, however, since a rule for viewing a picture cannot be enforced in practice. (See the "prescriptions"of artificial perspective and the misunderstandings to which they have led, discussed later in this chapter.)

Note that treatment of a surface to display invariants excludes the case of treat- ment that modifies the surface as such. The surface can be ornamented. decor- ated, embellished: its reflectance can be altered: its texture can be changed-all without causing it to specify something other than what it is, a surface. No doubt there are true mixtures of decoration and description, especially in architecture and pottery, Pictures and Visual Awareness 261

but the extremes are distinct. The painter who is a decorator and the painter who is a depictor are different people and should not be confused. Aesthetics, in my opinion, has nothing to do with it. We can distinguish between a surface as an aesthetic object and a surface as a display of information. The surface that displays information may also be an aesthetic object, but the cases are different. A picture is a surface that always specifies something other than what it is.

The Picture as a Record

The above definition is not sufficient. To say that a picture yields an array of optical information clears up a welter of confusion, I think, but it does not say enough. A picture is also a record. It enables the invariants that have been extracted by an observer-at least, some of them-to be stored, saved, put away and retrieved, or exchanged. Pictures are like writing inasmuch as they can be looked at again and again by the same observer and looked at by many observers. They allow the original observer to communicate in a fashion with unborn generations of other observers. Art museums, like libraries, are storehouses of knowledge, and they permit knowledge to accumulate. Pictures convey know- ledge at second hand and thus are efficient methods of teaching the young. But the knowledge they convey is not explicit. It is not put into words. Most of the formless invariants in the array from a picture could not be put into words anyway. They can be captured by an artist but not described.

PICTURES FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING

I became interested in pictures and films during the war as a psychologist

concerned with training young men to fly airplanes. In 1940-1946 a million

Americans were learning this quite unnatural skill. I was impressed by the

possibilities of visual education, inadequately so-called. You cannot tell

students how to fly; you cannot let them learn by trial and error. You

can have them learn by imitation, but that is expensive; you should try

to show them how to fly. If the stimulus situation could be simulated, they

would learn without danger of crashing. But just how did a picture, still or

moving, simulate the real situation that the student would later face? How

did pictures in general prepare the young for life? The literature of visual

education proved to be worthless. I wrote an essay entitled "Pictures as

Substitutes for Visual Realities"(Gibson, 1947, Ch. 8), and then "A Theory of

Pictorial Perception"(Gibson, 1954)，abandoning one definition of a picture

after another for twenty years, as noted above. A student of mine has written

a book called A Psychology of Picture Perception (Kennedy, 1974)which makes

a beginning but still does not get to the heart of the problem. 262 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

This is the problem of the picture as a provider of secondhand perception.

It becomes even more difficult if extended to the picture as a source of

secondhand fantasy, a provider of fictions, of creative imagination, of

aesthetic enjoyment, or the picture as a way in which its maker can think

without words (Arnheim, 1969).

What exactly is a picture a record of? I used to think that it was a record of perception, of what the picture maker was seeing at the time she made the picture at the point of observation she then occupied. It can be a record of perception, to be sure, and a photographic picture is such a record, but the chirographic picture need not be. I tried to describe several kinds of nonperceptual experiences in the last chapter, and the artist can make a record of these just as well as she can of what she perceives. She can record imaginary things, from the probable and possible all the way to the most fantastic of her dreams and hallucinations. She can paint her recollection of something that no longer exists. She can paint fictions. And even when she is perceiving she is seeing into the past and the future to some extent, so that she captures more than the surfaces projected at the instantaneous present.

Even a photograph records a field of view, a sample of the ambient light, and is thus analogous to looking with the head. It is a record of what the photo- grapher selected for attention. A chirograph is even more selective. Any picture, then, preserves what its creator has noticed and considers worth noticing. Even when she paints a fiction or a fantasy, she does it with invariants that have been noticed in the course of learning to perceive.

A Theory of Drawing and its Development in the Child

Let us consider this remarkable business of preserving what one is aware of; let us try to understand it. Cro-Magnon man drew pictures of what interested him on the walls of caves, and people of all cultures have been drawing pictures ever since. All of us can draw, even those who never learned to write. Writing was not invented until our ancestors learned to record their words on a surface, and that is harder to learn than recording an awareness. Ideographs and syllabaries and alphabets would never have been devised if people had not already been drawing for thousands of years. But what is drawing?

The lore and literature of drawing masters and schools of art provide no help in answering this question. The manuals on how to draw are thoroughly confusing, for there has never been a coherent theory of the cooperation of the eye and the hand. Courses in mechanical or geometrical drawing using a ruler and compass do not answer the question. Neither do courses in architectural drawing. The courses in so-called graphics that I am familiar with are full of inexcusable contradictions, glossed over for the sake of covering up ignorance. The courses in so-called basic Pictures and Visual Awareness 263

design are equally sloppy. Do we now have a coherent theory of the cooperation of eye and hand? Not yet, but perhaps the assumptions of Chapter 12 on the visual control of manipulation will give us at least a beginning.

The Fundamental Graphic Act

In the child, both drawing and writing develop from what I call the fundamental graphic act, the making of traces on a surface that constitute a progressive record of movement (Gibson, 19666, Ch. 11). Presumably our primitive ancestors had also been making and observing traces long before the first artist discovered that by means of lines one could delineate something. The first man to make a mammoth appear on the wall of a cave was, I am confident, amazed by what he had done. The chimpanzee can make scribbles and do finger painting, but he cannot draw anything.

The words we have for this fundamental graphic act describe it badly and belittle it-scribbling, dabbling, doodling, daubing, scratching, and so on. But we should study it carefully and not belittle it. Of all the hand-held tools that have been invented, the sort that makes traces on a surface is especially note- worthy-the stylus, brush, pen, pencil, crayon, or marker. The movement of the tool over the surface is both felt and seen. The muscle-joint-skin kinesthesis is emphasized by orthodox sensory psychology, and the visual kinesthesis is emphasized by my perceptual psychology. But these are transient awarenesses. The seeing of a progressive record of the movement of the tool is lasting. There is a track or trail of the movement, like the afterimage of a firebrand whirled in the darkness, except that it is permanent-a stroke, a stripe, or a streak, in short a trace. This emphasizes lines and pointed tools, but the same principles hold for patches and brushlike tools.

The young child practices the fundamental graphic act in sand, mud, or a plate of food, to the dismay of his parents. When given a tracing tool, the child uses it on approved surfaces as soon as he can hold the tool, beginning at around sixteen months of age. The permanent trace is what interests the child. Gibson and Yonas (1968) found that one-and-a-half to three-year-olds who scribbled zealously with a pencil would stop when a nontracing pencil that provided everything but the trace was secretly substituted. Moreover, three-year-old scribblers in a nursery school refused to "draw a picture in the air"on request and asked for paper on which they could draw a "real picture."

Now consider what the child will begin to notice as he sees the accumu- lating traces on a surface, and if he sees them frequently. He has no words for what is there; in fact, there are no adequate terms for it.

The quality called straight looks different from that called curved, and there are opposite curves.

The trace can begin and end, or it can be continuous. 264 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

A continuous trace can change direction with a jerk, a zigzag (although terms such as angle and apex will not be learned for years).

A line can be made between existing marks to connect them, and marks can be lined up.

A continuous trace can come back to where it began, whereupon a peculiar feature emerges that we call closure.

A continuous trace is apt to produce an invariant called intersection. It makes connections.

Traces that do not intersect are very peculiar, and some have the quality of being parallel.

It will become evident that a new trace that exactly follows an old one adds nothing to the display (although the term coincide has yet to be learned).

It may be noticed that a trace on one sheet of paper can be fitted over a trace on another sheet, in the same way that a child's block can be fitted into an aperture (the template, or so-called form board). This is preparation for the axiom of congruence in Euclidean geometry.

All of these features in the scribbles of childhood are invariants. While they are being noticed in the child's own trace-making, they are surely also being noticed in the pictures that are shown him in the nursery, and eventually some of the natural invariants that appeared in the ambient array from the outset will begin to be identified with the graphic invariants.

Replicating or Copying

Copying is fundamentally the act of making traces on a surface that coincide with the traces on another surface, either one surface overlaid on another or one that could be overlaid on another. The child can "trace over"an existing trace, or he can "trace"an existing pattern on a transparent or semitransparent overlay so as to replicate it. He can thus perceive the congruence of the two patterns. He learns how to match traces and to see the match, or the mismatch, of separated traces. Eventually he will learn other methods of printing and template matching, but the graphic method, I suspect, comes first.

To copy by comparison is harder than to copy by coincidence-tracing. The ability to copy freehand a diamond-shaped form is not achieved by the average child until age seven, according to the Binet test norms. What we call freehand trace-making refers also to the fact that the movement of the tool is not constrained by a ruler, a compass, a scale, or any other drawing instrument. But it is controlled by something. I suggest that it is controlled by invariants of the sort listed.

Making a perspective drawing of a scene on a sheet of glass is a special case of coincidence-tracing. This was the method of artificial perspective discov- ered by the painters of the Renaissance and recommended by Leonardo da Vinci. It involves setting up the glass as if it were a window and then, with one Pictures and Visual Awareness 265

FIGURE 15.2 The perspective projection on a picture plane of square units of the ground out to the horizon.

This drawing shows the main invariants of artificial perspective as distinguished from those of natural perspective, which were shown in Figure 5.1. The parallel edges of a track or a pavement project to straight lines that converge to a point, the vanishing point. The squares of the track correspond to trapezoids on the picture plane, diminishing as a function of distance. No one who studies this drawing could fail to be impressed by the elegance of the principles of pictorial perspective. eye exactly fixed in front of the window, drawing lines on the surface to coin- cide with the projections of the occluding edges of the layout, the edges and corners of the layout (the dihedrals), and the fissures, sticks, fibers, and pigment borders Chapter 3). The penumbras of shadows or the shading of curved surfaces cannot be traced, however, and the method is not as easy as it is made to sound. Actually, it is not a practicable method but a sort of demonstration of how to visualize the surface of the canvas as if it were a transparent picture plane. The implication is that something like freehand copying is possible for a scene as well as for another drawing. But this, I believe, is false.

The terms copy, replica, duplicate, and image, however familiar, are vague and slippery. The ghostly copy of an ideal form on a transparent plane was illus- trated in Figure 15.1, but the making of substantial copies on surfaces and sheets with ink or pigment is another matter entirely.

Drawing Proper

By gradual stages human children begin to draw in the full meaning of the term-to draw a man or a woman, a house, a flower, or the sun in the sky. The child is still making lines on a surface that record the movements of the tool in his hand, but he is now also recording an awareness in terms of the invariants he has picked up. He delineates for himself and others something he has appre- hended or experienced. The traces he leaves on the paper are not just lines, or the outlines of forms, but the distinguishing features of the environment. 266 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

While drawing, he may be looking at something real, or thinking about some- thing real, or thinking about something wholly imaginary; in any case, the invariants of his visual system are resonating. The same is true of the artist as of the child. The invariants are not abstractions or concepts. They are not know- ledge; they are simply invariants.

Let us contrast this theory of drawing with the traditional theory. The latter assumes that drawing is either from "life," from "memory,"or from "imagina- tion."Drawing is always copying. The copying of a perceptual image is drawing from life. The copying of a stored image in the mind is drawing from memory. The copying of an image constructed from other memory images is drawing from imagination. This theory of drawing is consistent with the mentalistic doctrine that assumes an optical image on the retina, a physiological image in the receptors, a transmitted image in the nerve, a cerebral image in the brain, and finally a mental image in the mind that is subject to all sorts of creative transformations.

How is the copying of an image supposed to occur? An ancient metaphor is often appealed to, the projection of an image outward from the eye. Many persons ignorant of vision find this easy to accept. The notion is lent a false plausibility by the fact that the aftersensation caused by overstimulating the retinal receptors with a strong light is called an afterimage and is visible on any surface looked at as long as the eye is fixed. If a physiological afterimage impressed on the retina can thus be thrown outward, why not a mental afterimage imposed on the brain? So the reasoning goes. Drawing from life would consist of looking at the model and getting an image, looking at the drawing pad, and then just tracing around the outline of the projected image. Drawing from memory or imagination would differ only in that the artist has to "consult"her memory and "summon"an image. If she cannot trace around the projected mental image, at least she can copy it freehand. Perhaps drawing is not exactly like this, they say, but something like this. Otherwise, what could it be? The projecting of a mental image outward upon an existing drawing is even supposed to explain one's perception of the drawing, as E. H. Gombrich (1960), for example, maintained at one time.

I insist that what the draftsman, beginner or expert, actually does is not to replicate, to print, or to copy in any sense of the term but to mark the surface in such a way as to display invariants and record an awareness. Drawing is never copying. It is impossible to copy a piece of the environment. Only another drawing can be copied. We have been misled for too long by the fallacy that a picture is similar to what it depicts, a likeness, or an imitation of it. A picture supplies some of the information for what it depicts, but that does not imply that it is in projective correspondence with what it depicts.

The Muddle of Representation

If this new theory is correct, the term representation is misleading. There is no such thing as a literal re-presentation of an earlier optic array. The scene Pictures and Visual Awareness 267

cannot be reestablished; the array cannot be reconstituted. Some of its invari- ants can be preserved, but that is all. Even a photograph, a color photograph at its technological best, cannot preserve all the information at a point of observa- tion in a natural environment, for that information is unlimited. As for re-presenting the stimulation in the sense of reimposing an old pattern of light energies on the retina, that is quite impossible. The full range of energies and wavelengths in light cannot be preserved on film. Some of the ratios, the contrasts or relations in the light, can be captured but not the sensations of brightness and color.

THE CONCEPT OF PROJECTION

Ever since it was first realized that an image of a solid object in the sense of

its form or figure could be "thrown" upon a surface by a source of light such

as the sun or a candle flame, the relation of the object to its shadow and the

nature of this projection have provided food for thought. Art and geometry,

philosophy, psychology, physiology, optics, and mathematics have borrowed

the concept. Plato used it in the parable of the cave, whose dwellers could

never perceive real objects but only their shadows cast upon the wall before

them. The notion of projective correspondence in geometry came from this

concept. The shadow plays came from it. The throwing of lantern slides on a

screen by a projector came from it. The projecting outward of a mental

image on a surface comes from it and I will have more to say about this later.

But this is not consistent with the projecting inward of the form of an object

onto the retinal surface and thence into the mind. Nevertheless, despite this

contradiction, both kinds of projection, outward and inward, are accepted

by those who believe that perception involves both a retinal image and a

mental image.

The efforts made by philosophers and psychologists to clarify what is meant by a representation have failed, it seems to me, because the concept is wrong. A picture is not an imitation of past seeing. It is not a substitute for going back and looking again. What it records, registers, or consolidates is information, not sense data.

What About the Illusion of Reality? The Duality of

Picture Perception

A picture is not like perceiving. Nevertheless, a picture is somehow more like perceiving an object, place, or person than is a verbal description. The illusion of reality is said to be possible. Painting can reach a degree of perfection, we are 268 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

told, such that viewers cannot tell whether what they see is a canvas treated with pigments or the real surfaces that the painter saw, viewed as if through a window. In his monumental study of pictorial representation, Gombrich(1960, p. 206)repeats the story of the Greek painter who had imitated grapes so perfectly that the birds came to peck at them, and the story of his rival who bested him by painting a curtain so deceptively that the painter himself tried to lift it from the panel. The tradition of "fooling the eye" is very ancient. The assumption that a false perception of real surfaces can be induced in the art gallery or the psychological laboratory is widely believed. If the artificial array is the same as the natural array, it will yield the same perception. There will arise an illusion of reality without a genuine reality. The perception of a solid cylindrical tunnel can be brought about by a mere display of light and dark rings, according to the experiment I described in Chapter 9. The eye is easily deceived, and our faith in the reality of what we see is therefore precarious. For two millenniums we have been told so.

The purveyors of this doctrine disregard certain facts. The deception is possible only for a single eye at a fixed point of observation with a constricted field of view, for what I called aperture vision. This is not genuine vision, not as conceived in this book. Only the eye considered as a fixed camera can be deceived. The actual binocular visual system cannot. A viewer can always tell whether he is looking at a picture or at a real scene through a window. I do not FIGURE 15.3 Drawing by Alain. (C 1955 The New Yorker Magazine, Inc.) Pictures and Visual Awareness 269

believe the stories about birds and painters being fooled, any more than I believe that Pygmalion really fell in love with his statue. The illusion of reality is a myth. The same automatic tests for reality that distinguish between a percep- tion and a mental image, as described in the last chapter, will also distinguish between a perception and a physical image. We go on believing the myth only because it fits with what the authorities tell us about perception, with retinal image optics.

A picture, photographic or chirographic, is always a treated surface, and it is always seen in a context of other nonpictorial surfaces. Along with the invari- ants for the depicted layout of surfaces, there are invariants for the surface as such. It is a plaster wall, or a sheet of canvas, a panel, a screen, or a piece of paper. The glass, texture, edges, or frame of the picture surface are given in the array, and they are perceived. The information displayed is dual. The picture is both a scene and a surface, and the scene is paradoxically behind the surface. This duality of the information is the reason the observer is never quite sure how to answer the question, "What do you see?"For he can perfectly well answer that he sees a wall or a piece of paper. It is this duality in the optic array from a picture that makes the drawing a bad way to begin the study of perception.

I have in my time, like many perceptionists, arranged for a display ofinform- ation to be seen through a peephole, that is, to be viewed through an aperture close to the eye. This is supposed to minimize the information for the surface as such and enhance the illusion of reality. I find, however, that, far from being a simple expedient, it complicates the act of perception. Keeping the observer from making tests for reality does not increase the impression of reality.

No painter and no photographer should ever strive to give viewers the feeling that they are looking at a real place, object, person, or event. There is no need to do so. In any case, the effort is bound to be a failure.

A picture is both a surface in its own right and a display of information about something else. The viewer cannot help but see both, yet this is a paradox, for the two kinds of awareness are discrepant. We distinguish between the surface of the picture and the surfaces in the picture. In such paintings as those of the impressionists, we can see the difference between the illumination of the picture and the illumination in the picture. The two sets of surfaces are not comparable, and the two kinds of illumination are not commensurable.

I once took a good, sharp photograph of a lawn with trees and a paved walk and had it enlarged about twenty times so that it could be mounted on a six- foot panel. The observer stood at a point where the visual angle of the picture at his eye was the same as the visual angle of the array admitted to the camera. He was told to estimate distances in terms of the number of paces needed. To the question, "How far away from you is the elm tree?"he would visualize himself walking up to it and reply, "Thirty paces." But to the question, "How far away from you is the picture?"he would pause and reply, "Oh, that's four paces."For the latter estimate he had to shift the operation of his visual system

270 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

so as to pick up quite different invariants. The lawn in the picture was not connected with the floor of the room.

Consider next the kind of picture that stands at a far extreme from the photomural above. Psychologists have long been showing inkblots to their subjects and asking what they saw. A set of such random blobs on cards devised by Hermann Rorschach has now been standardized and is in use by clinical psychologists. Faced with a card, a sensible patient might very well say simply that she saw a blot, but she seldom does. She attends to the nameless squiggles, contours, textures, and colors and says, "A bleeding heart"or "A pair of dancing bears,"allowing the psychologist to diagnose her fantasy life. I have argued that a Rorschach blot is a picture of sorts containing information not only for bleeding hearts and dancing bears but for dozens of other events (Gibson, 1956). It is different from a regular picture in that the invariants are all mixed up together and are mutually discrepant instead of being mutually consistent or redundant. It is rather like a mass of scribbles for a child in this respect.

The old mentalistic explanation of perceiving objects in clouds and inkblots. incidentally, is projection, the projecting outward of fantasy images from the unconscious mind as if by a mental magic lantern. Hence, the Rorschach is called a"projective"test. This is mischievous nonsense. But the dogma of two different contributions to perception, one objective and one subjective, one coming from the world and the other coming from the mind, is so strong that the notion of a picture being thrown outward to mix with a picture being thrown inward is widely believed.

What are we to call the tree in the photograph, or the bleeding heart in the inkblot? Neither is an object in my terminology. I am tempted to call them virtual objects. They are not perceived, and yet they are perceived. The duality of the information in the array is what causes the dual experience. We need to understand the apprehension of virtual objects and, of course, virtual places, events, and persons. We can only do so in connection with the perceiving of the real surfaces of the environment, including the picture surfaces. Note that our distinction between virtual and real will have to be independent of the distinction in classical optics between virtual and real images, which is swamped in epistemological confusion.

I conclude that a picture always requires two kinds of apprehension that go on at the same time, one direct and the other indirect. There is a direct perceiving of the picture surface along with an indirect awareness of virtual surface-a perceiving, knowing, or imagining, as the case may be.

The Power of Perspective in Painting

If it is not true that a picture in perspective represents reality and a picture not in perspective fails to represent reality, what is true? My answer is that if a picture displays the perspective of a scene it puts the viewer into the scene, but Pictures and Visual Awareness 271

that is all. It does not enhance the reality of the scene. The seeing of oneself is not negligible, but it is not the sole aim of depiction. The advocates of perspective representation are mistaken, but those who reject perspective as a mere conven- tion are also mistaken. There is complete confusion on all sides. The terms in which that debate has proceeded are thoroughly misleading.

The dogma that linear perspective adds depth to a picture along with the other kinds of perspective that are "cues"for depth is a source of endless confusion. The term perspective is generally misunderstood. The theory of projection on a trans- parent picture plane to a stationpoint is a Renaissance discovery that is properly called artificial perspective. The theory of the ambient optic array from an environ- ment to a point of observation should be called natural perspective and is not at all the same thing. Artificial perspective leads to a set of prescriptions for producing virtual streets, buildings, and interiors seen from a fixed position and a corollary requiring that the painting be viewed with one eye at a unique station point. Natural perspective leads to ecological optics and the concept of the invariant structure in a changing optic array. On the one hand, painters are inclined to reject the prescriptions of artificial perspective but are then tempted to disbelieve in any kind of perspective. On the other hand, scientists who are impressed with classical optics and the elegance of projective geometry are tempted to disbelieve in the efforts of modern painters. Each side is talking past the other.

What they need to understand in order to find a common ground, I think. is how it is possible for an observer to see something from no point of observa- tion as well as from a given point of observation, that is, from a path of obser- vation as well as a position. What modern painters are trying to do, if they only knew it, is paint invariants. What should interest them is not abstractions, not concepts, not space, not motion, but invariants.

The separation of invariant structure from perspective structure is the heart of the problem. The invariants display a world with nobody in it, and the perspective displays where the observer is in that world. One can depict without a fixed point of observation, just as one can visualize without a point of observation, although it is not easy to understand how. But depiction with a point of observation is the more natural sort, and the photographic picture is necessarily of this sort.

There are metaphors to describe the powerful experience aroused by the picture that locates the observer in a virtual environment: one is taken out of oneself; one is transported; one is set down in a far place. The place may be a distant part of the real environment or another world. Travel pictures take one to where the traveler has been. Battle pictures take one into the heart of the melee. Historical pictures take one to the forum of ancient Rome. Religious pictures take one straight to heaven, or hell. The viewer sees himself in the environment, for it extends out beyond the frame of the picture.

What is induced in these pictures is not an illusion of reality but an awareness of being in the world. This is no illusion. It is a legitimate goal of depiction, if not the only one. 272 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Is Depiction a form of Description?

It is troublesome for a painter to follow the prescriptions of artificial perspective, as any serious work on the subject clearly shows (e.g., Ware, 1900). Even when the prescriptions are followed it is impossible to enforce the rule for the beholder, for no viewer could be expected to maintain one eye at the proper station point in the air in front of the picture, even if the art gallery provided a bite-board or headrest to specify the viewpoint for each painting hung. But that is the only way to prevent distortions of the virtual layout, as students of perspective have long known and as the book by M. H. Pirenne (1970) has fully explained. The distortions themselves are not all that serious. Perspective was not worth the trouble, painters thought. The photographer could make an exact perspective picture automatically, so why bother to master all that geom- etry? It was a complicated and controversial business in any case. Visual scient- ists with all their theorizing know little about the actual art of painting. A fine art should not be subject to rules and regulations. This is the attitude of many modern painters and most schools of art.

The theory that artificial perspective is no more than a convention of Western art is a way of justifying this attitude. E. Panofsky (1924-1925) asserted that perspective is "symbolic."G. Kepes(1944) has written about the "language"of vision. R. Arnheim (1954)believes that we will learn to see what is represented by abstract painters even if we now cannot. And N. Goodman (1968) in Languages of Art assumes that depiction is fundamentally description, that we learn to read a picture as we learn a language, and that linear perspective could just as well be reversed from the way we have become accustomed to interpret it.

Now it is one thing to argue that the use of perspective is not necessary for a painting, but it is quite another to say that perspective is a language. That says that both the perspective and the invariants of a picture must be analogous to words and that, just as we can learn a new vocabulary, so we can learn a new mode of perception. If a language of words can be invented such as Esperanto, why not a language of art? But the essence of a picture is just that its information is not explicit. The invariants cannot be put into words or symbols. The depiction captures an awareness without describing it. The record has not been forced into predications and propositions. There is no way of describing the awareness of being in the environment at a certain place. Novelists attempt it, of course, but they cannot put you in the picture in anything like the way the painter can.

The Consciousness of the Visual Field

The doctrine of flat visual sensations together with the theories of sensation- based perception, of the cues for depth, and of how the cues get interpreted developed in close connection with the rise of perspective painting from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century. A picture was obviously a patchwork of Pictures and Visual Awareness 273

pigments on a surface. By analogy the picture in the eye was a patchwork of colored light on the retinal surface. Hence, the deliverance of the eye to the mind was a corresponding patchwork of visual sensations. This was supposed to be what the infant saw at birth, and what a person born blind but given sight by the removal of a cataract saw when the bandage was first removed (Senden, 1960). The patchwork was the innate basis of visual perception, the product of untutored vision, unprejudiced by learning. The duty of a painter, said John Ruskin, was to recover the innocent eye ofinfancy in depicting nature (Gombrich, 1960, p. 296). All psychologists accepted the doctrine of two-dimensional sensations; they disagreed only in that some believed the cues for depth to be wholly learned and others supposed that concepts of space were innate.

It has been generally believed that even adults can become conscious of their visual sensations if they try. You have to take an introspective attitude, or analyze your experience into its elements, or pay attention to the data of your perception, or stare at something persistently until the meaning fades away. I once believed it myself. I suggested that the "visual field" could be attended to, as distinguished from the "visual world," and that it was almost a flat patchwork of colors, like a painting on a plane surface facing the eye (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 3). The awareness of depth in the scene could not be wholly eliminated, I thought, but it could be reduced. The similarity to a painting could be enhanced by not rotating the head and not displacing it, by closing one eye, and by avoiding any scene with motion. I recognized even then that the normal field of view of an ocular orbit is continu- ally changing and that an arrested pattern is exceptional.

My comparison of the visual field to a perspective painting, although guarded, now seems to me a serious mistake. No one ever saw the world as a fHlat patchwork of colors-no infant, no cataract patient, and not even Bishop Berkeley or Baron von Helmholtz, who believed firmly that the cues for depth were learned. The notion of a patchwork of colors comes from the art of painting, not from any unbiased description of visual experience. What one becomes aware of by holding still, closing one eye, and observing a frozen scene are not visual sensations but only the surfaces of the world that are viewed now from here. They are not flat or depthless but simply unhidden. One's attention is called to the fact of occlusion, not to the pseudofact of the third dimension. I notice the surfaces that face me, and what I face, and thus where I am. The atti- tude might be called introspective or subjective, but it is actually a reciprocal, two-way attitude, not a looking inward. The surfaces viewed now from here were illustrated in Figure 11.1.

What is it to see in Perspective? Patchwork Perspective vs.

Edge Perspective

One can learn to view an object in perspective, or a whole vista, but that does not imply learning to see it as if it were a picture. One does not flatten out the 274 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

object or the scene as if painting it on a picture plane; all one does is separate the hidden from the unhidden surfaces and observe the occluding edges. The natural perspective of visual solid angles is what counts here, not the artificial perspective of pigment patches.

Drawing in perspective does depend on viewing in perspective, it is true, but this only means that drawing requires the learner to notice the edges of the layout confronting him, especially the occluding edges. He must also notice other invariants, of course, but the edges are the fundamental basis for his picture. What we loosely call an outline in a picture refers to the outer edges of the face of an object. The surfaces need to be specified first in a picture; the colors, textures, shadows, and illumination can be rendered later. I am saying that edge perspective is a fact, whereas patchwork perspective is a myth. One can learn to view the former but not to see the latter.

The young child learning to draw has long interested both psychologists and artists. When he first draws a man or a truck or a table, I suggest, he depicts the invariants that he has learned to notice. He does not draw in patchwork perspective, for he never had the experience of a patchwork. He may not yet draw in edge perspective because he has not noticed it. Hence, he may draw a table with a rectangular top and four legs at the corners because those are the invariant features of the table he has noticed. This is a better explanation than saying he draws what he knows about the table, his concept, instead of what he sees of the table, his sensation. The fatal flaw of the latter explanation is that it ought to be the other way around. The child should begin by drawing sensa- tions and progress to drawing concepts.

The Principles of Line Drawing

To the extent that the natural optic array is composed of visual solid angles, and only to that extent, the information in the array can be captured by a line drawing. The envelopes of the solid angles, being discontinuous, must corres- pond to discontinuities in the environment instead of gradual transitions. More precisely, a line drawing can specify the following invariants of surface layout: a corner (the apex of a concave dihedral), an edge (the apex of a convex dihedral), an occluding edge (either apical or curved), a wire (fiber), a fissure (crack in a surface), and a skyline (division between earth and sky). A line drawing cannot specify the following invariants: the shading on a curved surface, the penumbra of a cast shadow, the texture of a surface, or the reflectance (color)of a surface, although it can specify an abrupt discontinuity of shading, of texture, and of color. The features of a terrestrial layout that can be shown by lines are illustrated in Figure 15.4.

The lines of a line drawing must connect with one another. They divide the picture into superordinate and subordinate areas in a lawful way. There must be visual solid angles at the station point of the picture analogous to visual solid Pictures and Visual Awareness 275

FIGURE 15.4 Some of the possible meanings of a line: corner, edge, occluding edge, wire, fissure, skyline, horizon, margin.

Can you find all these things in the picture?

angles at the point of observation of a natural optic array, those coming from the faces of surfaces, from the openings between surfaces, and from the patches of sky. The lines that separate areas on the picture plane should therefore not be called outlines, for this term implies detached objects in empty space and the fallacy that figure-on-ground is the prototype of perception. The term refers mainly to the occluding edge of a detached object but not to that of an aperture. A line in a line drawing can occlude either inward or outward depending on its connection with other lines. And a convex or concave dihedral, the junction of two planar surfaces, is given by a line, but this is not an "outline." The term outline drawing should be confined to the unusual and misleading case of a line with closure, one that returns upon itself, a form, and this kind of display contains only the weakest sort of information about anything, as I pointed out at the beginning of this chapter. It does not even specify the solid shape of a detached object.

The information in a line drawing is evidently carried by the connections of the lines, not by lines as such. To put it another way, the invariants are found in the ways that the areas are nested, not in the forms of these areas. These ways are difficult to describe in words. The connections, junctions, and intersections of lines remain invariant under a changing perspective of the surfaces.

A line segment in a drawing connected at one end in one way and at the other end in an incompatible way may specify a discrepancy in the layout of surfaces. This is the basis, I think, of the depictions of "impossible objects"that have recently gained popularity. The best known is perhaps the three-pronged tuning fork. At one end it is two rectangular bars, but at the other it is three cylindrical bars. How can this be? 276 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

In Figure 15.5, line 1 and line 6 are so connected at both ends that they specify occluding edges, although they are curved occluding edges on the left and apical occluding edges on the right. Line 2 is connected so as to specify a curved occluding edge on the left but a convex dihedral edge on the right. So is line 5. Line 3 produces a genuine shock to the visual system, for it occludes the background on its lower side at the left end but occludes the background on its upper side at the right end. Line 4 does the same, but inversely. The reversal of the direction in which the virtual edge hides or conceals is disconcerting. It involves what I will call an ecological contradiction as distinguished from a verbal contradiction. The transition from surface to air cannot possibly reverse in this way. The discrepancy of information is clearly to be found in the different connections of the line segment at its two ends, as is evident if one covers up one end and then the other.

These anomalies of depiction can be combined in very elaborate ways, as the drawings of the Dutch graphic artist Escher have demonstrated. Far from proving that the beholder creates the world he perceives in a picture, however, they suggest the existence of laws of optical information that are general and exact.

One thing at least should be clear: the "lines" of line drawings and the "lines"of geometry are entirely different. The depicting of surfaces should not be confused with the ghosts of abstract geometry. We are taught in geometry that a line is derived from points, a plane from lines, and a space from planes. We learn the three axes of Descartes's coordinate geometry and the concept of space as a sort of boxlike container of points and lines that combine to make planes and solids, conceived for the benefit of abstract physics.Hence,the modern artist is constrained to assume what Paul Klee asserted, namely, that the graphic elements available to the painter are "points, lines, planes, and volumes."

The connections of the lines in a drawing convey the information, not the lines as such. What differs in these drawings is the information for perceiving occlusion, not for perceiving depth. The information displayed in the third drawing is contra- dictory. The information displayed in the fourth is ambiguous, because either of two positions of the cube is possible, and the perception therefore fluctuates.

When the artist works to capture invariants, all that he knows to say about what he is doing is that he depicts "space." But this is misleading.

J. M. Kennedy (1974)has described many of the characteristics of line draw- ings in much the same spirit that has been adopted in this chapter. But his conception of optical information is imprecise, it seems to me, since it is not based on ecological optics.

The capturing of optical invariants by line drawings is a fascinating exercise. It has seemed to be both familiar and mysterious. It is not, however, funda- mental. Much of the information in a natural optic array is lost in a drawing inasmuch as the array cannot be reduced to nested solid angles. The invariants under changing illumination and those under the changing direction of the prevailing illumination (Chapter 5)are lost. So are the invariant relations that specify the textures and colors of surfaces. Some of these are captured by painters who use a variety of tools other than the pen or pencil. But mostly what is lost in a picture, drawing, painting, or photograph is the information that can be extracted only from the changing perspective structure of the ambient optic array of a moving observer.

Summary

The perplexities connected with the making and seeing of pictures are problems in their own right, independent of the problems of direct visual perception.

It is a fallacy to assume that perception is simplest when there is a form on the retina that is a copy of a form on a surface facing the retina, that is, in point- to-point correspondence with it. 278 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The information in the optic array from a picture to a point of observation

consists of invariants, not of forms and colors.

A picture requires two kinds of apprehension, a direct perceiving of the

picture surface along with an indirect awareness of what it depicts. This dual

apprehension is inescapable under normal conditions of observation. The

"fooling of the eye," the illusion of reality, does not then occur.

When young children learn to draw, they certainly do not begin by drawing

their sensations in patchwork perspective and then progress to the stage of

drawing their concepts. But neither do they begin by drawing their concepts

and then progress to the stage of drawing their sensations. They simply draw

the invariants they have learned to notice.

A picture is a record of what its creator has seen or imagined, made available

for others to see or imagine.

Depicting should be distinguished from the decorating, ornamenting,

embellishing, or beautifying of a surface considered as such. The problems of

aesthetics exist in their own right. 

## 16. Motion Pictures and Visual Awareness



I suggested in the last chapter that a picture is a surface so treated as to make available an arrested optic array, of limited scope, with information about other things than the surface itself. What, then, is a motion picture? There is a treated surface, but the treatment has to consist of throwing shadows on the surface by projection instead of depositing traces or pigments on it. An optic array of limited scope is delivered, and it contains information about other things than just the surface itself. The main difference is that the array is not arrested. Its structure undergoes change, disturbance, or transformation. It is not frozen in time. And that is what we need to understand about it.

This definition of the motion picture is broad enough to include not only the kind made with photographic film that uses the stroboscopic principle in the projector and camera but also the kind made with a modulated scanning beam as in television, and the kind made with shadow's projected on a translu- cent screen as in a shadow play, and the various kinds made with the optical gadgets now being tried out experimentally by kinetic artists.

The technology of cinema and television has reached the very highest level of applied science. The psychology of the awareness provided by a motion picture, however, is nonexistent, apart from an essay by J. Hochberg and V. Brooks (1978), to whom I am indebted for much good talk about the problems of the film. There are no experts on this form of perception. Muddles and misconceptions prevail. We are led to conceive a sort of apparatus inside the head that is similar to the apparatus for making a picture show outside the head. We have been taught that a picture is sent from the eye up to the brain, and so we conclude that a series of pictures can be sent up to the brain. We all know what a snapshot is, and we know that a film is a series of snapshots. If we are told that a movie presents us with a sequence of retinal snapshots joined by what is called the "persistence of 280 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

vision." we believe it. But we are misled. Nevertheless. this is what we are told by movie commentators who have read physiological optics and believed it.

The motion picture camera and projector do not comprise the only method that can be used to produce a changing optic array. Nor is the stroboscopic prin- ciple the only principle that can be applied. There are other ways of doing it, and the inventors of the nineteenth century tried out dozens of gadgets with names such as kinescopes and kinegraphs, vitascopes and vitagraphs, that have now been mostly forgotten. It is not even always true that the motion in a chan- ging array is "apparent"and not "real." The important thing is not the apparatus devised for the motion picture but the information it provides for our vision.

The Changing Optic Array

Let us recall once again that the arrested optic array is an unusual case of the chan- ging array; it is obtained in a frozen world by an observer who holds still and uses one eye. The eye continues to work, but it is not what the organ evolved for. Optical rest is a special case of optical motion, not the other way around. The eye developed to register change and transformation. The retinal image is seldom an arrested image in life. Accordingly, we ought to treat the motion picture as the basic form of depiction and the painting or photograph as a special form ofit. What a strange idea! It goes counter to all we have been told about optics. But it follows directly from ecological optics. Moviemakers are closer to life than picture makers. The Progressive Picture

Unfortunately, we have no adequate term to describe what I will call the progressive picture as contrasted with the arrested picture. The term motion picture implies that motion has been added to a still picture. Cinematography, or cinema, is no better. The term photoplay is not right. Film sounds neutral, but live tele- vision does not use film. What gets depicted is a flow of events. What gets displayed are disturbances of structure in the array, with underlying invariants of structure. These are what the visual system picks up.

The progressive picture displays transformations and magnifications and nullifications and substitutions of structure along with deletions and accretions and slippage of texture. These are the "motions" of the motion picture, as I put it in Chapter 6. They are thoroughly saturated with meaning. They are lawful, even if not described by geometry. They can show people, animals, objects, places, and events with the utmost precision and elaboration. They need to be studied by experimental psychologists on the one hand and by experimental moviemakers on the other. They cannot be usefully studied by taking the para- meters of"motion"and plodding through the systematic variations of the tradi- tional experiment. But on the other hand, neither can they be understood by playing around with aesthetic intuitions. Motion Pictures and Visual Awareness 281

The progressive picture can also of course depict the movement of the observer himself in the environment as well as the motions of objects: it can arouse visual kinesthesis as well as visual event perception. This fact was pointed out in Chapter 10 and will be further discussed later in this chapter.

The progressive picture can turn into an arrested picture if a"stop-action" shot is inserted in the sequence. This is much used in film and television nowa- days. The differences between the two kinds of depiction become clearly evident, along with the similarities between them.

The Arrested Picture

If it is true that a drawing, painting, or photograph is actually an arrest of the normally changing array, we shall have to revise our thinking. The arrest has to be artificial, for no event can be stopped in midflight. It is an abrupt noncontinuation of the event, with a continuing nontransformation of the array. The picture is not, as we have supposed, the optic array at an instant, a single moment of time, but an unnatural stopping of the flow. The painter of a quiet landscape, to be sure, arrests only the very slowest of the changes and emphas- izes what is invariant in the scene but nevertheless stops action.

We can now understand, I think, why painters stubbornly continue to insist that they can portray "motion" in a still picture. This is one of the paradoxes mentioned in the last chapter. Painters cannot display or represent motion, but they can certainly specify an event. The stopped event may contain the inform- ation for perceiving it. The wind in the trees can be depicted if the painter selects the right form in the transformation. So can the smile of a sitter for a portrait. The act of dancing can be conveyed by a photographer because the invariants are different from those of standing or walking. There are event- invariants as well as formless object-invariants.

The arrested picture can specify a progressive event. What the progressive picture can do is to specify it more completely. As for the formless invariants, they are stronger in a changing picture than they are in a changeless picture, but they are still present.

What Can the Movies Make Available?

The film, like the photograph and the painting, makes possible not only percep- tual awareness but also several kinds of nonperceptual awareness. I refer to the edited film made with a motion picture camera or its television equivalent. The perception or imagination is vicarious, an awareness at second hand. Consider the possibilities.

A film can depict situations and problems that you will have to face at a later time, we call this an educational film. It can depict vistas of distant scenic places to which you may never go and the connections between vistas, a travel film. It 282 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

may show events that happened only yesterday, a news film. It may depict ways of life, histories, adventures, encounters with wondrous persons, prophetic events, fictions, and fantasies; we call these documentary films, historical films, adventure films, and wish-fulfillment films. They are usually full of what their producers call "action." We are addicted to them, all of us, children and adults. The beholder is apt to identify himself with a protagonist to whom he feels sympathy, and this means he puts himself at the point of observation of the protagonist in the way I have described. He thus gets perception, knowledge, imagination, and pleasure at second hand. He even gets rewarded or punished at second hand. A very intense empathy is aroused in the film viewer, an aware- ness of being in the place and situation depicted. But this awareness is dual. The beholder is helpless to intervene. He can find out nothing for himself. He feels himself moving and looking around in a certain fashion, attending now to this and now to that, but at the will of the film maker. He has visual kinesthesis and visual self-awareness, but it is passive, not active.

To behold a motion picture is thus similar in important ways to observing the ordinary happenings of life. But it is also radically dissimilar in other ways that are just as important. Both need to be understood. In the case of the film, one's movements of approaching to scrutinize or retreating to get a fuller view are controlled by the film maker. In the case of the real environment, one is free to move as one pleases, that is, as one "wills."But note that the scanning of fine details in the array sample is free and unconstrained in both cases. The film maker cannot interfere with your eye movements. He can control only your head movements and your locomotion.

What does a verbal Narration Make available?

A narration or description can also of course give one the kinds of awareness at second hand that the film can. And the reader is controlled by the writer as much as the film viewer is controlled by the film maker. Neither can look for herself, or visualize for herself, or imagine for herself. She is at the mercy of the artificer, the artist, the maker, the one-who-shows. But let us not confuse the kind of information that has been put into words with the kind that has been simply displayed. Film is not a language with a grammar, as some film makers like to believe. A graphic depiction is not an explicit description and, similarly, a motion picture is not a verbal narration.

A Theory of Filming and Film-Editing

The ecological theory of perceiving advanced in this book has implications for filmmaking. Film-viewing, I said, is both similar and dissimilar to natural observing. Let us follow up this suggestion. Motion Pictures and Visual Awareness 283

The Composition of a Film

A motion picture is composed of virtual events joined tegether. One kind of junction is obtained by turning the camera from one event to another during a continuous run of film (panning)or rolling the camera stand from one location to another during a run of film (dollying). But another kind of junction is obtained by splicing together strips of film, each being the result of a single run called a take or a shot. These junctions, the transitions between the events 284 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

displayed, are crucial for film-making. Events have to be nested in a coherent way if the superordinate events are to be intelligible.

Note that the cameraman or motion picture photographer is the person who moves the camera and changes the lenses, whereas the editor or cutter is supposed to be the one who puts together the shots, using either splices called cuts or other optical transitions called fades, wipes, dissolves, and the like that are made by photographic special effects. But both functions ought to be performed by the same person, or at least under the direction of the same person for, if I am right, the cameraman and the editor are doing the same thing. Camera movement and film-splicing are not separate kinds of composition.

The Camera and the Head of the Viewer

The motion picture camera occupies a point of observation in a studio set or on a real location, just as the head of an observer does in an ambient environment. The camera can turn, look up or down, and undergo locomotion, more or less as the head does. The field of view of the camera is analogous to the combined field of view of the eyes in the head in the sense that both fields are bounded by occluding edges, although the visual solid angle sampled by the camera is much smaller than the visual solid angle sampled by the head, which is nearly a hemi- sphere. Note that the light entering an eye and forming a retinal image is emphatically not analogous to the light entering a camera, as photographers assume.

In this analogy, the camera, film, projector, and screen are all components of the same device, a way of providing information to a seated viewer. The field of view of the camera becomes the optic array to the viewer, even when he is not placed so as to get the same-sized angular field of view that the camera got. The screen picture functions as a mobile window hiding most of the environ- ment being filmed, and the edges of the picture can sweep over the ambient array of the environment in the way described in Chapter 12, with gain and loss at the leading and trailing edges of the picture. The seated viewer never actu- ally turns his head, of course, but he gets the essential optical information for doing so. And thus, he becomes aware of a whole new world behind the magic window.

The window can turn sideways quite naturally. This is called panning, on the intuitive belief that the awareness becomes "panoramic" during such a shot. It does in a way, but not because the picture is panoramic. The window can also look up or down. Theoretically it could also tilt, although this is seldom done in practice. The edges of the window can also go forward or backward, or travel sideways, when the camera is moved on a dolly, truck, or crane. The dolly shot is a well-known way of moving close up so that an item of interest fills the window or far back so that a whole array of items is included. The use of a zoom lens that alters the field of view from wide angle to narrow angle or Motion Pictures and Visual Awareness 285

the reverse is now common as a substitute for the dolly shot. It too gives the feeling of approach or retreat, but the dolly shot is preferable when it is possible, for the zoom shot cannot display the deletion or accretion that occurs at occluding edges.

The modes of camera movement that are analogous to the natural move- ments of the head-body system are, in this theory, a first-order guide to the composing of a film. The moving camera, not just the movement in the picture, is the reason for the empathy that grips us in the cinema. We are onlookers in the situation, to be sure, not participants, but we are in it, we are oriented to it, and we can adopt points of observation within its space. The illusion of participation can be enhanced by having the camera occupy the point of obser- vation of one of the protagonists in the story. This has been done commercially only once to my knowledge, in The Lady in the Lake, a Hollywood murder mystery in which Robert Montgomery played the hero but was scarcely visible since his acts of locomotion and exploration, his adventures, and his encounters with the woman and the villain were carried out by the camera. It was the camera that was punched in the face and kissed by the woman. The so-called subjective camera does not deserve the neglect in which it is now held by film producers.

Films for training and education can profit by having the camera occupy the point of observation of the learner. A student can be shown what it is like to land an airplane or operate the controls of an earthmover or tie knots. But because a theory of visual kinesthesis and control has been lacking (Chapter 13), the method has not been exploited.

The Psychology of Film-Splicing

We have been talking about the filming of natural movements; what about the joining of shots? It seems plausible to me that the various kinds of cutting that a film editor can perform also have analogues in perception and that the inser- tion of fades, wipes, dissolves, and other special effects is at least an attempt to create transitions with psychological meaning. Composers of film are guided only by their feeling for what works. Some film theorists, as we shall note, try to take lessons from painters, but the lessons to be learned are not clear.

A cut represents a displacement of the camera between shots. The most intel- ligible cuts, I suggest, are those between shots that have some invariant struc- ture in common. A displacement of the camera forward or backward yields a structure that is magnified or minified, and one sees the same layout afterward as before. Such a displacement is the same as a dolly shot or a zoom, except that it is discontinuous. The familiar sequence-long shot, medium shot, close- up-has a common structure at the center of the picture. A rotary displacement of the camera yields a shot that overlaps its predecessor unless the angle is greater than the camera's field of view. It is thus the same as a pan. 286 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Next, there are cuts in which the viewer is displaced on a circular path around the event being filmed. He sees the lovers, say, from the north where the man's face is in sight and then from the south where the woman's face is in sight. Such differing vantage points, revealing different surfaces, seem to be called "camera angles," but it is not a good term. If underlying invariants are shared, the viewer will perceive the same two persons as before and be aware that he has been instantly transported to another viewpoint, not that the lovers are different persons or that they have been rotated.

Instant transportation of the onlooker can be attempted from one room to another in the same house or from one neighborhood to another in the same countryside-in short, from place to place. Intelligibility depends on whether the viewer has been previously oriented to the environment being portrayed, that is, whether the nesting of places has been established. This can be done with establishing shots, and it can also be done by connecting the major vistas of the environment with dolly shots. Orientation is crucial for comprehension.

Cutting back and forth between distant places, as in scenes of the heroine tied to the railroad tracks and the hero riding to the rescue, ought to suggest that the hero is getting closer, not farther away. The events are concurrent, but at what places? Chase sequences have a similar problem. There is no overlap of structure between such alternating shots, but there must be some common invariants. What are they?

The split screen provides a way of depicting concurrent events at widely separated places without cutting back and forth. Instant transportation of the onlooker is avoided, but the ecological paradox of being in two places at once is introduced.

Instant transportation in time is attempted by the so-called flashback. Characters who have already been depicted in later events are depicted as involved in earlier events, often in the same place. But the jump in sequence, like the jump from place to place, must be made intelligible. Aristotle had a psychological point when he argued that drama should maintain the "unities" of time and space.

The cut is abrupt. Gradual transitions are possible, such as the fade-out, the fade-in, and the combining of the two in a dissolve that superimposes the structures of the two shots so that a perception of transparency is induced and one layout of surfaces is gradually converted into another layout by way of becoming insub- stantial, by passing into "thin air"and out again. Another gradual transition is the wipe, where a line something like an occluding edge (but not optically the same) passes across the screen, concealing one vista and revealing another. The psycho- logical meaning of these transitions has never been studied experimentally by either film editors or perceptionists, but the ecological approach to vision suggests how they might do so. Cuts, fades, dissolves, and wipes are not pure conventions the meaning of which can be arbitrarily decided by film makers and taught to us. The practice of jump-cutting in films and television seems to me ill founded. Motion Pictures and Visual Awareness 287

The Theory of Montage

A quite different theory of the nature of filmic transitions seems to be widely accepted by directors and critics. This theory is based on the assumption that any juxtaposition of shots, however disparate, will form a unified "image"with a new meaning. The combination is more than the sum of the parts. The doctrine is identified with a book translated as The Film Sense (Eisenstein, 1942). The author, a famous Russian director, is celebrated for the boldness with which he combined shots of events that did not ordinarily occur together.

Montage, in this sense of the term, is related to collage. The latter was invented by painters who tried composing a work of art by pasting items on the canvas instead of painting forms on it. The associating of scraps, pieces, pictures, or forms not previously associated was thought to yield a fresh insight, or an unexpected gestalt. The word collage means a paste-up. The creation could be photographed and displayed. Similarly, strips of film could be spliced together. "The juxtaposition of two separate shots resembles not so much a simple sum of one shot plus another shot as it does a creation"(Eisenstein, 1942，p. 7). The vague aesthetic optimism of this movement stands in contrast to the theory of natural underlying invariants of structure. But it had and has a considerable influence on both graphic artists and film artists.

The composing of a film, however, is not comparable to the composing of a painting. The film is composed of events and superordinate events, of episodes, happenings, and history. The linkages must be made with care, and the continuity must be preserved. At the end all the minor events should constitute a comprehensive major event.

I have said nothing in this treatment of the motion picture about the flow of sound that accompanies the flow of the optic array, the sound track that paral- lels the picture track. I have been discussing the silent film, for purposes of theoretical simplicity. The sequence of events in life is given by the acoustic flow of information as well as the optical flow, and accordingly, in film, the sound track is exactly synchronized with the picture track (with the exception of music). This helps to maintain the continuity of the viewer's awareness in the face of jump-cutting. But the theory of the invariants under auditory change and their relation to invariants under visual change is another matter entirely. They are not the same for the flow of environmental sounds as they are for the flow of speech sounds (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 5).

Depiction by Film

If the foregoing approach is correct, there is such a thing as filmic depiction that is distinct from ordinary depiction. Its aim is to produce in the viewer the awareness of a train of events, and of the causal structure of these events. They are virtual instead of real events, to be sure, and no one is ever wholly deceived, 288 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

as when having a hallucination, but the feeling of being present in the world behind the magic window is very strong.

This awareness of events is achieved by segmenting the flow of the pictorial optic array so that it specifies the same kinds of subordinate and superordinate happenings that are specified in a natural optic array. Persons, animals, places, objects, and substances are depicted along with the events. The segments of the optical flow are crucial, that is, the transients between parts as well as the parts themselves. Simply to call them "motions"is not to do justice to them

Filmic depiction shares with verbal narration, storytelling, the capability of showing what happens if so-and-so happens, the predictable causal sequences of the world, along with the accidental happenings, the unpredictable sequences. But it shares with ordinary depiction, perspective pictures, the capability of putting the observer into the scene.

Summary

What we call the motion picture as distinguished from the still picture might better be called the progressive picture as distinguished from the arrested picture. It is not characterized by "motion"so much as by change of structure in the optic array. And the ordinary picture is not so much "still"as it is stopped.

The progressive picture yields something closer to natural visual perception than does the arrested picture. The nameless transformations that constitute it and that are so hard to describe are actually easier to perceive than the familiar frozen forms of the painting or photograph.

It provides a changing optic array of limited scope to a point of observation in front of the picture, an array that makes information available to a viewer at the point of observation. This delimited array is analogous to the temporary field of view of a human observer in a natural environment surrounding the observer.

The information in the display can specify the turning of one's head, the act of approaching or withdrawing, and the adopting of a new point of observa- tion, although one is all the time aware of holding still and looking at a screen from a fixed position in a room. This is over and above the information in the display for an awareness of events and the places at which the events are happening, along with an awareness of the objects, persons, or creatures of the imagination to which the events are happening. The invariants to specify the places, objects, and persons emerge more clearly in the transforming array than they would in a frozen array.

The art of film-editing should be guided by knowledge of how events and the progress of events are naturally perceived. The composing of a film is not analogous to the composing of a painting. The sequential nesting of subordinate events into superordinate events is crucial. The transitions should be psycholo- gically meaningful, and the sequential order of happenings should be intelli- gible. But the picture theory of vision and the stimulus sequence theory of Motion Pictures and Visual Awareness 289

perception are very poor guides to moviemaking. The theory of ecological perception, of perception while moving around and looking around the envir- onment, is better. The various kinds of filmic transition-zoom, dolly, pan, cut, fade, wipe, dissolve, and split-screen shot-could usefully be evaluated in the light of ecological optics instead of the snapshot optics that is currently accepted. 

## APPENDIX 1

The Principal Terms Used in Ecological Optics

The environment of animals, as distinguished from the physical world, consists of a medium, substances, and the surfaces that separate the substances from the medium.

The medium for terrestrial animals is air. Air is insubstantial and thus permits locomotion. Locomotion is controlled by the information in the medium.

Information is provided by sound-fields, by odor-fields, and above all by illu- mination. Information, in this terminology, is not transmitted but is simply available.

Illumination is the steady state of reverberating radiant energy such that light is ambient at all points in the medium.

Substances are solids and liquids that vary in composition, and in resistance to change. Different substances have different affordances. Substances are gener- ally opaque, that is, they reflect and absorb but do not transmit.

The surface of a substance has a characteristic texture, reflectance, and layout. The ambient light at any point in the medium is structured by the light reflected from surfaces so that these characteristics are specified.

Surfaces, substances, and the medium manifest both persistence and change, persisting in some respects and changing in others. The changes are environ- mental events. Animals need to perceive what persists and what changes. A surface goes out of existence when its substance evaporates or disintegrates; a surface comes into existence when its substance condenses or crystallizes.

Layout refers to the persisting arrangement of surfaces relative to one another and to the ground. Different layouts have different affordances for animals. The perception of layout takes the place of the perception of depth or space in traditional terminology. Appendixes 295

The ground is the basic persisting surface of the environment. It is the surface of support, the terrain, the earth extending out to the horizon. It is normally cluttered.

Clutter of the environment refers to objects or surfaces that occlude parts of the ground and divide the habitat into semi-enclosures. Semi-enclosures provide vistas.

A detached object is a substance with a surface that is topologically closed and is capable of displacement. Animals are detached objects.

An attached object is a substance with a surface that is not wholly closed and is continuous with another surface, usually the ground. It cannot be displaced without breaking the surface.

An edge is the junction of two surfaces that make a convex dihedral angle.

A corner is the junction of two surfaces that make a concave dihedral angle.

An occluding edge is an edge taken with reference to a point of observation. It both separates and connects the hidden and the unhidden surface, both divides and unites them. The same can be said of the far side and the near side of an object. As the point of observation moves in the medium, or as the object moves, the hidden and the unhidden interchange, or the far side becomes the near side and the reverse. For curved surfaces and tangential occluding edges, instead of flat surfaces and apical occluding edges, the rule is the same.

A point of observation is a position in the medium that can be occupied by an animal. It is stationary only as a limit. A moving point of observation entails a path of observation. Different observers can perceive on the same path of obser- vation. The point of observation in ecological optics should not be confused with the station point of a picture in discussions of artificial perspective.

Occlusion is one of the three main types of going out of sight. A surface can go out of sight at an occluding edge, at a great distance, or in the dark. In all three cases coming into sight is the reverse of going out of sight, and thus is unlike coming into existence which is not the reverse of going out of existence. All displace- ments and turns of an observer's body, or of an object, bring about a change of occlusion. There are two kinds, self-occlusion and superposition.

Going out of sight at an occluding edge is specified by progressive decrements of structure on one side of a contour in the optic array. Coming into sight at an edge is specified by progressive increments of structure on one side of the contour. Going out of sight in the distance is specified by optical minification of struc- ture to the limit. Going out of sight in darkness is specified by reduction of illumination to the limit.

The optic array at a moving point of observation is disturbed by what we call changing "perspective" and changing "parallax,"which have never been care- fully analyzed. Nevertheless, there is reason to suppose that invariants of the array underlie these changes: ratios, gradients, discontinuities, and other rela- tions in the ambient light that owe their existence to the persisting features of the environment. (The structure of the array is also disturbed by motions and 296 Appendixes

deformations of parts of the environment and by movement of the sun in the sky, but invariants are presumed to underlie these changes also.)

An arrested optic array at a fixed point of observation has a kind of structure that is somewhat easier to understand. It can be described in terms of visual solid angles that are both densely packed and "nested"up to the hemispheric solid angle of the earth and the spherical angle of the whole ambient array. The envelope of each solid angle intercepts a face of the layout projected to that point, or a facet, or an aperture. Although this description of optical structure is superior to that in terms of rays and pencils of rays, it still cannot cope with shading and transparency, or surface color. But it does emphasize the fact that there is a unique optic array for every fixed point of observation in the envir- onment; no two are identical.

Disturbance of structure is a general term that will encompass all kinds of change in the optic array. Different disturbances specify different happenings. The term motion, borrowed from mechanics, does not apply to an optic array, and the term transformation, taken from geometry, is not suitable either, because it does not cover a gain or loss of structure.

Successive overlapping samples of the ambient optic array are picked up by an observer during head movements. The field of view of the head is a sliding sample of the array as the head turns, gaining structure at the leading edge and losing structure at the trailing edge. The field of view of the head consists of the combined fields of view of the two eye-sockets. The amount of simultaneous overlap of the two fields of view differs, being large in the human and small in the horse, but successive overlap is common to all animals. Simultaneous disparity of the overlapping binocular fields has been overemphasized in physiological optics. Note that samples of the ambient array take the place of retinal images in physiological optics.

Scanning of the field of view is the successive foveating of details of its sample by each eye. The exploratory scanning of a field should not be confused with the exploratory sampling of the ambient array. Some animals do not have foveated eyes and do not scan.

The visual system is distinguished from the visual sense, from the modality of visual experience, and from the channel of visual inputs. It is a hierarchy of organs and functions, the retina and its neurons, the eye with its muscles and adjustments, the dual eyes that move in the head, the head that turns on the shoulders, and the body that moves around the habitat. The nerves, tracts, and centers of the brain that are necessary for vision are not thought of as the "seat" of vision. APPENDIX 2

The Concept of Invariants in Ecological Optics

The theory of the concurrent awareness of persistence and change requires the

assumption of invariants that underlie change of the optic array. Four kinds of

invariants have been postulated: those that underlie change of illumination,

those that underlie change of the point of observation, those that underlie overlap-

ping samples, and those that underlie a local disturbance of structure.

It would simplify matters if all these kinds of change in the optic array could

be understood as transformations in the sense of mappings, borrowing the term

from projective geometry and topology. The invariants under transformation

have been worked out. Moreover it is easy to visualize a form being transposed,

inverted, reversed, enlarged, reduced, or foreshortened by slant, and we can

imagine it being deformed in various ways. But, unhappily, some of these

changes cannot be understood as one-to-one mappings, either projective or

topological (Chapter 6). Consider the four kinds.

1. Invariants of optical structure under changing illumination. Sunlight, moon-

light, and lamplight can fluctuate in intensity, alter the direction from which

they come to the layout, and differ in color. Hence the illumination can change

in amount, in direction, and in spectral composition. Some features of any optic array

in the medium will change accordingly. There must be invariants for perceiving

the surfaces, their relative layout, and their relative reflectances. They are not

yet known, but they almost certainly involve ratios of intensity and color

among parts of the array (Chapter 5).

2. Invariants of optical structure under change of the point of observation. Note that

a different point of observation is occupied by one eye of the human observer

relative to the other, but that the invariants over this so-called disparity are the

same as those under a change caused by a displacement of the head. A change 298 Appendixes

and a difference are closely related. Some of the changes in the optic array are

transformations of its nested forms, but the major changes are gain and loss of

form, that is, increments and decrements of structure, as surfaces undergo

occlusion. Proportions and crossratios underlie the transformations, however,

and extrapolations, interpolations, gradients, and horizon-ratios underlie the

increments and decrements. In short, the flow of the array does not destroy the

structure beneath the flow (Chapters 5 and 13).

3. Invariants across the sampling of the ambient optic array. What I called looking

around involves the reversible sweeping of the field of view over the whole array,

back and forth, with continuous successive overlap. There is presumably a

common structure in the sliding sample, and this may be thought of as invariant

(Chapters 7 and 12).

4. Local invariants of the ambient array under local disturbances of its structure.

Besides the motions of the sun, the observer, and the observer's head, there are

local events. These include not only displacements and rotations of rigid

detached objects, but also deformations of rubbery surfaces-in fact all sorts of

events from a rolling ball to rippling water, and from a growing infant to a

smiling face. Each produces a specific disturbance of optical structure. But the

surface, the ball, the water, and the face are seen to be continuations of them-

selves by virtue of certain non-disturbances of optical structure (Chapter 6).

These four kinds of invariants are optical. There are also surely invariants in

the flow of acoustic, mechanical, and perhaps chemical stimulation, and they

may prove to be closely related to the optical, but I leave them for the reader's

speculation. The study of invariants is just beginning.

The theory of the extracting of invariants by a visual system takes the place

of theories of "constancy" in perception, that is, explanations of how an

observer might perceive the true color, size, shape, motion, and direction-

from-here of objects despite the wildly fluctuating sensory impressions on

which the perceptions are based. With invariants there is no need for theories

of constancy. The reader, however, may consult a recent survey (Epstein, 1977)

for the view that invariance-detection is only one more theory of perceptual

constancy.

These terms and concepts are subject to revision as the ecological approach

to perception becomes clear. May they never shackle thought as the old terms

and concepts have! BIBLIOGRAPHY
