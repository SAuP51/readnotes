Medium, Substances, Surfaces

According to classical physics, the universe consists of bodies in space. We are

tempted to assume, therefore, that we live in a physical world consisting of

bodies in space and that what we perceive consists of objects in space. But this is

very dubious. The terrestrial environment is better described in terms of a

medium, substances, and the surfaces that separate them.

The Medium

Let us begin by noting that our planet consists mainly of earth, water, and

air-a solid, a liquid, and a gas. The earth forms a substratum; the water is

formed by the substratum into oceans, lakes, and streams; and the formless

gases of the air make a layer of atmosphere above the earth and the water. The

interface between any two of these three states of matter-solid, liquid, and

gas-constitutes a surface. The earth-water interface at the bottom of a lake is

one such, the water-air interface at the top is another, and the earth-air inter-

face is a third-the most important of all surfaces for terrestrial animals. This is

the ground. It is the ground of their perception and behavior, both literally and

figuratively. It is their surface of support.

One characteristic of a gas or a liquid as contrasted with a solid is the fact that

a detached solid body can move through it without resistance. Air is "insub-

stantial"and so is water, more or less. It thus affords locomotion to an animate

body. A gas or a liquid, then, is a medium for animal locomotion. Air is a better

medium for locomotion than water because it offers less resistance. It does not

require the streamlined anatomy needed by a fish for rapid movements.

Another characteristic of a gas or liquid medium is that it is generally trans-

parent, transmitting light, whereas a solid is generally opaque, absorbing or Medium, Substances, Surfaces 13

reflecting light. A homogeneous medium thus affords vision. The way in which it does so will be described in Part II. For the present it is sufficient to observe that a terrestrial medium is a region in which light not only is transmitted but also reverberates, that is, bounces back and forth between surfaces at enormous velocity and reaches a sort of steady state. The light has to be continually replenished from a source of illumination because some of it is absorbed by the substances of the environment, but the reverberating flux of light brings about the condition we call illumination. Illumination "fills"the medium in the sense that there is ambient light at any point, that is, light coming to the point from all directions. Ambient light, as we shall see, is not to be confused with radiant light.

A third characteristic of air or water is that it transmits vibrations or pressure waves outward from a mechanical event, a source of sound waves. It thus makes possible hearing what we call the sound; more exactly, it permits listening to the vibratory event. (The solid earth also transmits pressure waves, to be sure, but we do not ordinarily call them sound waves unless we are thinking in terms of physics. In physics a medium is any substance, including solids, that transmits waves.)

A fourth characteristic is the fact that a medium of air or water allows rapid chemical diffusion whereas the earth does not. Specifically, it permits mole- cules of a foreign substance to diffuse or dissolve outward from a source when- ever it is volatile or soluble. In this way, the medium affords "smelling"of the source, by which I mean detecting of the substance at a distance.

Let us next observe that animal locomotion is not usually aimless but is guided or controlled-by light if the animal can see, by sound if the animal can hear, and by odor if the animal can smell. Because of illumination the animal can see things; because of sound it can hear things; because of diffusion it can smell things. The medium thus contains information about things that reflect light, vibrate, or are volatile. By detecting this information, the animal guides and controls locomotion.

If we understand the notion of medium, I suggest, we come to an entirely new way of thinking about perception and behavior. The medium in which animals can move about (and in which objects can be moved about) is at the same time the medium for light, sound, and odor coming from sources in the environment. An enclosed medium can be "filled" with light, with sound, and even with odor. Any point in the medium is a possible point of observation for any observer who can look, listen, or sniff. And these points of observation are continuously connected to one another by paths of possible locomotion. Instead of geometrical points and lines, then, we have points of observation and lines of locomotion. As the observer moves from point to point, the optical inform- ation, the acoustic information, and the chemical information change accord- ingly. Each potential point of observation in the medium is unique in this respect. The notion of a medium, therefore, is not the same as the concept of 14 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

space inasmuch as the points in space are not unique but equivalent to one another.

All these facts about moving bodies and about the transmission of light, sound, and odor in a medium are consistent with physics, mechanics, optics, acoustics, and chemistry, but they are facts of higher order that have never been made explicit by those sciences and have gone unrecognized. The science of the environment has its own facts.

Another important characteristic of a medium, it should now be noted, is that it contains oxygen and permits breathing. The principles of respiration are the same in the water as in the air; oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide is emitted after the burning of fuel in the tissues. This ceaseless chemical exchange of substance is truly the "flame of life." The animal must breathe, whether by gills or by lungs. It must breathe all the time and everywhere it goes. Thus, the medium needs to be relatively constant and relatively homogeneous.

Both the air and the water do afford breathing. The amount of oxygen in the air has not departed much from 21 percent in countless ages. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, although variable, tends to be sufficient. Animals have been able to rely on oxygen, and this is why evolution could proceed. Similarly, both the air and the water tend to be homogeneous, although fresh water differs from salt water. From place to place, the composition of air changes very little and the composition of water changes very gradually, for the temporary gradients that arise are dissipated by winds and currents. There are no sharp transitions in a medium, no boundaries between one volume and another, that is to say, no surfaces. This homogeneity is crucial. It is what permits light waves and sound waves to travel outward from a source in spherical wave fronts. Indeed, it is what makes a chemical emanation from a source foreign to the medium itself, and thus capable of being smelled.

Finally, a sixth characteristic of a medium for animal life is that it has an intrinsic polarity of up and down. Gravity pulls downward, not upward. Radiant light comes from above, not below, from the sky, not the substratum, and this is as true in the water as in the atmosphere. Because of gravity, water pressure and air pressure increase downward and decrease upward. The medium is not isotropic, as the physicist says, along this dimension. Hence it is that a medium has an absolute axis of reference, the vertical axis. Even the two horizontal axes of reference are not wholly arbitrary, for they depend on sunrise and sunset. This fact reveals another difference between medium and space, for in space the three reference axes are arbitrary and can be chosen at will.

The Properties of the Atmosphere

To sum up, the characteristics of an environmental medium are that it affords respiration or breathing; it permits locomotion; it can be filled with illumina- tion so as to permit vision; it allows detection of vibrations and detection of Medium, Substances, Surfaces 15

diffusing emanations; it is homogeneous; and finally, it has an absolute axis of reference, up and down. All these offerings of nature, these possibilities or opportunities, these affordances as I will call them, are invariant. They have been strikingly constant throughout the whole evolution of animal life.

Events in the Atmosphere

The atmospheric medium, unlike the underwater medium, is subject to certain kinds of change that we call weather. Sometimes there are drops or droplets of water in the air, rain or fog. Annually, in some latitudes of the earth, the air becomes cold and the water turns to ice. Occasionally the air currents flow strongly, as in storms and hurricanes. Rain, wind, snow, and cold, the latter increasing toward the poles of the earth, prevent the air from being perfectly homogeneous, uniform, and unchanging. The changes are rarely so extreme as to kill off the animals, but they do necessitate various kinds of adaptation and all sorts of behavioral adjustments, such as hibernation, migration, shelter- building, and clothes-wearing.

Substances

Consider next the portion of the environment that does not freely transmit light or odor and that does not permit the motion of bodies and the locomotion of animals. Matter in the solid or semisolid state is said to be substantial, whereas matter in the gaseous state is insubstantial, and matter in the liquid state is in between these extremes. Substances in this meaning of the term are more or less rigid. That is, they are more or less resistant to deformation, more or less impen- etrable by solid bodies, and more or less permanent in shape. They are usually opaque to light. And the substantial portion of the environment is heterogen- eous unlike the medium, which tends to be homogeneous.

The substances of the environment differ in chemical composition. As every- body knows, there is a limited set of chemical elements, ninety or a hundred, and a much larger set of chemical compounds. More important for our purposes is the fact that there is an unlimited set of mixtures of elements and compounds, some being homogeneous mixtures and some not. The latter, the heterogen- eous mixtures, may be called aggregates. The air is a homogeneous mixture of oxygen and nitrogen with carbon dioxide; the water is a homogeneous mixture of H,O with dissolved oxygen and salts. But the earth, together with the "furni- ture"of the earth, is a heterogeneous aggregate of different substances.

Rock, soil, sand, mud, clay, oil, tar, wood, minerals, metal, and above all, the various tissues of plants and animals are examples of environmental substances. Each of these has a more or less specific composition, but almost none is a chem- ical compound, a pure chemical of the sort that is found on the shelves of chem- istry laboratories. A few substances such as clay are amorphous, that is, lacking in 16 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

structural components, but most of them are geometrical aggregates, that is, they are made of crystals and clumps, of cells and organs, of structures within struc- tures. These substances rather than chemicals are important for animals, for they must distinguish these in order to live.

What a substance is composed of can be analyzed at various levels. There is the compounding of chemical elements, but there are also the mixing of compounds and the complex aggregating of mixtures. When we talk about the composition of a substance, what it is made of, we must keep in mind the level of analysis that is appropriate to the problem being considered.

Why animals need to distinguish among the different substances of the environment is obvious. The substances have different biochemical, physiolo- gical, and behavioral effects on the animal. Some are nutritive, some are nonnu- tritive, and some are toxic. And it is very useful for a hungry animal to be able to distinguish the edible from the inedible substances at a distance, by vision or smell, rather than relying only on contact sensitivity, taste or touch.

Substances differ in all sorts of ways. They differ in hardness or rigidity. They differ in viscosity, which is technically defined as resistance to flow. They differ in density, defined as mass per unit volume. They differ in cohesiveness or strength, that is, resistance to breaking. They differ in elasticity, the tendency to regain the previous shape after deformation. They differ in plasticity, the tend- ency to hold the subsequent shape after deformation. Presumably all these properties of substances are explainable by the microphysical forces of attrac- tion among molecules, but they do not have to be analyzed at this level in order to be facts. Flint and clay were distinguishable substances for our primitive, tool-making ancestors long before men understood chemistry. So were wood, bone, and fiber.

Substances considered as compounds differ in their susceptibility to chem- ical reactions, in their degree of solubility in water, in their degree of volatility in air, and thus in their chemical stability or resistance to chemical transforma- tion. And they also differ, as will be emphasized later, in the degree to which they absorb light; a substance such as coal absorbs most of the light falling on it, whereas chalk, for example, absorbs very little of the light falling on it.

The substances of the environment change, of course, both structurally and chemically. Some solids dissolve, and their surfaces cease to exist. Leaves shrivel, and plants decompose. Animals decay and return their substances to the envir- onment. Metal rusts, and even the hardest rock eventually disintegrates into soil. The cycles of such changes are studied in ecology. Their causes at the molecular level of analysis are chemical and physical; they are governed by microphysical forces and by chemical reactions of the sort that chemists isolate and control in test tubes. But these changes also occur at a molar level of analysis as contrasted with the molecular level, and then they are environmental events, not simply physicochemical events. Large-scale chemical reactions are visible. The event we call combustion or fire is large-scale rapid oxidation. This is of Medium, Substances, Surfaces 17

enormous importance to animals, and they look out for it. But other forms of oxidation are too slow to be easily observed, the rusting of iron, for example.

A great many substances of the environment, of course, do not change either structurally or chemically, and the nonchange is even more important than the change. It is chiefly on this account that the environment is persistent. But also, even when substances change, they are often restored by processes of growth, compensation, and restitution so that an equilibrium or steady state arises and there is invariance despite change-an invariance of higher order than mere physicochemical persistence.

The Status of Water: Medium or Substance?

We must decide how we are to consider water. It is the medium for aquatic animals, not a substance, but it is a substance for terrestrial animals, not the medium. It is insubstantial when taken with reference to the aquatic environ- ment but substantial when taken with reference to the terrestrial environment. This difficulty, however, does not invalidate the distinction but only makes it depend on the kind of animal being considered. The animal and its environ- ment, remember, are reciprocal terms. The mediums of water and air have much in common, but they are sufficiently different to make it necessary here- after to concentrate on the environment of terrestrial animals like ourselves. For us, water falls into the category of substances, not medium.

The underwater medium is bounded both above and below, by a surface of water-to-air and a surface of water-to-mud. The atmospheric medium is bounded only below, by a surface of air-to-earth (or air-to-water), and it has no definite upper boundary. The fish is buoyed up by its medium and needs no surface of support. Our kind of animal must hold itself up off the ground with effort, working to maintain posture and equilibrium. The fish is cradled in the water and is never in any danger of falling down or falling off. We are always in such danger. The fish need never make contact with the bottom. But we cannot for long avoid contact with the earth, and only upon the earth can we come to rest. All animals-in the water, on the ground, or in the air-must orient to gravity in order to behave, that is, they must keep right side up (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 4), but this basic orienting activity is different in the fish, the quadruped, and the bird.

Some animals, to be sure, can get about in both water and air: the amphi- bians. They live an interesting life, and how they can perceive in either envir- onment is a problem very much worth study. The interface between air and water is not the barrier for them that it is for us. Humans can temporarily wear aqualungs, but not for long. We are terrestrial animals. Hereafter, I will concen- trate on the terrestrial environment of animals like ourselves.

We will also leave out of account very small animals that live in the soil. Earthworms and microorganisms actually get about in the spaces between solid 18 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

particles that contain both air and water, so they do not constitute exceptions to the general rule relating medium and substances.

Conclusions About Substances

To summarize what has been said about substances, they differ in both chemical and physical composition. They are compounded and aggregated in extremely complicated ways and thus do not tend toward homogeneity, as the medium does. They are structured in a hierarchy of nested units. And these different components have very different possibilities for the behavior of animals, for eating, for resisting locomotion, for manipulation, and for manufacture.

Surfaces and the Ecological Laws of Surfaces

For describing the environment, we have now established the triad of medium, substances, and surfaces, allowing for both persistence and change. The medium is separated from the substances of the environment by surfaces. Insofar as substances persist, their surfaces persist. All surfaces have a certain layout, as I will call it, and the layout also tends to persist. The persistence of the layout depends on the resistance of the substance to change. If a substance is changed into the gaseous state, it is no longer substantial and the surface together with its layout ceases to exist. These statements provide a new way of describing the environment.

For our purposes, this description is superior to the accepted description in terms of space, time, matter and material bodies, the forms of these bodies, and their motions. It is novel, but only in the sense that it has never been explicitly stated. Everything in the above paragraph has long been known implicitly by practical men-the surveyors of the earth, the builders, and the designers of the environment. It is tacit knowledge (Polanyi, 1966). This description is superior because it is appropriate to the study of the perception and behavior of animals and men as a function of what the environment affords, that is, to psychology.

The above description, to be complete, should include the reverberating flux of light in the medium. The way in which light is absorbed and reflected at surfaces and the way this action depends on the composition of the substances should also be considered. At the ecological level of size, surfaces soak up or throw back the illumination falling upon them, although at the atomic level of size, matter and light energy are said to interact. Substances are substantial with respect to light as much as they are substantial with respect to force. They resist the penet- ration of light as they resist the penetration of a moving body. And substances differ among themselves in the former respect as much as they do in the latter.

In our concern with surfaces and their purely geometrical layout, we must not forget that the air is filled with sunlight during the day and that some illumination always remains, even during the night. This fact, too, is an invariant Medium, Substances, Surfaces 19

of nature. Light comes from the sky and becomes ambient in the air. This is what makes persisting surfaces potentially visible as well as potentially tangible. How they are actually seen by animals with eyes is the problem of this book (although admittedly we are arriving at the problem only by slow stages). A potentially visible surface is one that could be looked at from some place in the medium where an animal might be. Nothing is implied about the actual stimulation of an eye, not yet. And no slightest reference is made to sensations of vision.

No mention has yet been made of luminous surfaces such as very hot bodies that emit light, or of flat surfaces of transparent substances such as glass that transmit light with refraction, or of polished flat surfaces such as mirrors that reflect light "regularly."Emission, absorption, transmission, refraction, and

diffraction refer to abstract laws of physical and geometrical optics. It may be possible to combine them in complex ways to explain the gross facts of illumin- ated terrestrial surfaces, but that possibility is something to be considered later.

Why, in the triad of medium, substances, and surfaces, are surfaces so important? The surface is where most of the action is. The surface is where light is reflected or absorbed, not the interior of the substance. The surface is what touches the animal, not the interior. The surface is where chemical reaction mostly takes place. The surface is where vaporization or diffusion of substances into the medium occurs. And the surface is where vibrations of the substances are transmitted into the medium.

A formulation of what might be called the ecological laws of surfaces would be useful. The following laws are proposed, without any claim of completeness. The list will serve, however, to focus the discussion, and it also provides an outline of what is to follow. The laws are not independent of one another and must be considered in combination.

1. All persisting substances have surfaces, and all surfaces have a layout.

2. Any surface has resistance to deformation, depending on the viscosity of the

substance.

3. Any surface has resistance to disintegration, depending on the cohesion of

the substance.

4. Any surface has a characteristic texture, depending on the composition of the

substance. It generally has both a layout texture and a pigment texture. 5. Any surface has a characteristic shape, or large-scale layout.

6. A surface may be strongly or weakly illuminated, in light or in shade.

7. An illuminated surface may absorb either much or little of the illumination

falling on it.

8. A surface has a characteristic reflectance, depending on the substance.

9. A surface has a characteristic distribution of the reflectance ratios of the

different wavelengths of the light, depending on the substance. This prop-

erty is what I will call its color, in the sense that different distributions

constitute different colors. 20 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Substance, Surface, Layout, and Persistence

The first law above merely summarizes what has been emphasized repeatedly about the substantial persisting surfaces of the environment. Combined with the second law, it explains why the level terrestrial surface, the ground, offers support for animals. They can crawl on the earth as a lizard or a human infant does, or they can walk or run on it because it is solid. But the law of layout also applies to surfaces like walls and obstacles that are barriers to locomotion- surfaces with which they will collide unless they stop short. A surface can be laid out parallel to gravity as well as perpendicular to it, so that surfaces can surround them as well as support them. A surface can even be held up by walls so as to be above them, that is, there can be a roof over their heads as well as a floor under their feet. A medium can be more or less enclosed by surfaces, and a cave, or a burrow, or a house is such an enclosure.

Resistance to Deformation

The second law allows for variation in the solidity of surfaces. It says that substances vary in the degree to which they resist deformation, from rigid to plastic to semisolid to liquid. When measured in terms of resistance to flow, this variable is called viscosity. The more fluid or flowing the substance, the more penetrable the surface, and the more changeable (less permanent) the layout. This law implies that the bog or swamp offers practically no support for standing or walking to heavy animals, and that the pond or lake offers no support. There will be more about the perception of a surface of support by terrestrial animals in Chapter 9.

With respect to obstacles, the second law implies that the surfaces of flexible substances are yielding or can be pushed aside, whereas the surfaces of rigid substances cannot. With respect to fluid substances, this law implies that fluid surfaces are polymorphic in the extreme; they can be poured, spilled, and splashed, and they can be smeared, painted, and dabbled in. The human infant explores these possibilities with great zest; the adult artisan has learned to perceive and take advantage of them.

Resistance to Disintegration

The third law allows for variation in the degree to which surfaces are breakable or go to pieces. The surface of a viscoelastic substance will stretch and remain continuous under the application of a force, whereas the surface of a rigid substance may be disrupted and become discontinuous. This distinction, incid- entally, is fundamental to topology, the branch of mathematics sometimes called "rubber sheet geometry,"in which it is assumed that a plane (actually a surface) can be bent or curved or stretched or compressed but cannot be torn. Medium, Substances, Surfaces 21

The second and third laws explain why clay can be pressed into the shape of a pot, whereas flint has to be chipped into the shape of an axe. And they explain why the pot and the axe become useless when broken. These laws imply that a house of glass is a poor place to live and the person who lives in one should certainly not throw stones.

Characteristic Texture

The fourth law concerns what I call texture, which might be thought of as the structure of a surface, as distinguished from the structure of the substance underlying the surface. We are talking about the relatively fine structure of the environment at the size-level around centimeters and millimeters. Surfaces of rock, or of plowed soil, or of grass are aggregated of different units-crystals, clumps, and grass blades, respectively-but these units are nested within larger units.

The texture of a surface arises from two main facts: first, a natural substance is seldom homogeneous but is more or less aggregated of different homogeneous substances; and second, it is seldom amorphous but is more or less aggregated of crystals and chunks and pieces of the same stuff. Hence, the surface of a natural substance is also neither homogeneous nor amorphous but has both a chemical and a physical texture; it is generally both conglomerated and corrugated. It has what I will call a pigment texture and a layout texture. It is generally both speckled and rough.

This says that a perfectly homogeneous and perfectly smooth surface is an abstract limiting case. A polished surface of glass approximates to it, but it has to be manufactured. Mirrors are rare in nature (although the still surface of the pool into which Narcissus gazed is a natural mirror).

When the chemical and geometrical units of a surface are relatively small, the texture is fine; when they are relatively large, the texture is coarse. If the units are sufficiently distinct to be counted, the density of the texture can be measured as the number of units in an arbitrary unit of area, a square centimeter or meter. But this is often very hard to do because units of texture are generally nested within one another at different levels of size. The texture of commercial sandpapaer can be graded from fine to coarse, but the textures of vegetation cannot. Moreover, the units of texture vary in form, and there are forms within forms, so that the "form"of a texture escapes measurement. The ideal pigment texture of a checkerboard and the ideal layout texture of a tessellated surface are rare.

The law says that rock, shale, soil, and humus have different textures and that mud, clay, sand, ice, and snow have different textures. It says that the bark and the leaf and the fruit of a tree are differently textured and that the surfaces of animals are differently textured, by fur, feathers, or skin. The surfaces of the substances from which primitive men fashioned tools have different textures- 22 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

flint, clay, wood, bone, and fiber. The surfaces of the artificial environment- plywood, paper, fabric, plaster, brick-have different textures. The surfaces with which man is beginning almost to carpet the earth are differently textured-the pavements of concrete, asphalt, and other aggregates. The texture FIGURE 2.1 The characteristic textures of the surfaces of various substances.

FIGURE 2.1 Continued

in each case specifies what the substance is, what the surface is made of, its composition. And that, as noted above, is something of great importance. The relations between the layout texture of a surface, the pigment texture, and the shadow texture are complex; they will be considered below and in Chapter 5.

It is important to understand the determinants of surface texture, so that we will later be able to understand what I call optical texture when this notion is 24 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

introduced in Part II. The two are not at all the same thing. It is enough to observe now that surfaces are homogeneous only as a limiting case-for example, the plaster wall behind a stage setting that looks like the sky from a distance-and that surfaces are smooth only as a limiting case, such as a sheet of plate glass and a mirror. Under certain conditions a homogeneous, very smooth, flat, large surface is not visible to a person or animal with ordinary eyesight.

Characteristic Shape

The fifth law has to do with the layout of the environment on a scale that is relatively large-its coarse structure or macrostructure. A surface can often be analyzed into facets, and a layout can often be analyzed into faces. This termin- ology refers to facing, that is, facing or not facing the source of illumination and facing or not facing the point of observation. For the present, let us take a surface to mean a flat surface, a face, and a layout of adjoining surfaces to mean a set of faces meeting at dihedral angles, that is, edges and corners. These terms will be defined later.

The law has to do with surface layout at the size-level of environmental enclos- ures and environmental objects. It asserts that enclosures and objects have charac- teristic shapes. Enclosures differ in shape as, for example, a cave, a tunnel, and a room differ. Objects differ in shape as, for example, the polyhedrons of solid geometry differ (the tetrahedron, pyramid, cube, octahedron, and so on) and in all the ways that the irregular polyhedrons differ. These geometrical solids, so-called, progress toward enormous complexity, but they can all be analyzed in terms of three components called faces, edges, and vertices. These components have meaning for environmental objects because, for example, the edge is character- istic of a cutting tool and the vertex is characteristic of a piercing tool.

Obviously, differently shaped enclosures afford different possibilities of inhabiting them. And differently shaped solids afford different possibilities for behavior and manipulation. Man, the great manipulator, exploits these latter possibilities to the utmost degree.

High and Low Illumination

The sixth law says that the light falling on a surface, the incident light, may be high or low, intense or dim, but that generally there is some illumination even at night. The completely dark room of the vision laboratory, like the deep inte- rior of a cave, is a limiting case.

The amount of sunlight falling on a terrestrial surface depends on the condi- tion of the atmosphere, clear or cloudy; but it also depends on two other factors that combine: the position of the sun in the sky and the orientation of the surface relative to the sky. It should be remembered that light comes from the Medium, Substances, Surfaces 25

whole sky as well as from the sun, and from other reflecting surfaces as well. Light reverberates between the sky and the earth and between surfaces. Direct illumination from a source is always mixed with indirect illumination. The incident light is never unidirectional, as it would be in empty space, but more or less omnidirectional. Nevertheless, there is always a"prevailing"illumina- tion, a direction at which the incident light is strongest.

A surface facing the prevailing illumination will be more highly illuminated than a surface not facing it. This seems to be a general principle relating illu- mination to surface layout. This principle means that the different adjacent faces of the environment will be differently illuminated at any given time of day. But it also means that the faces under high illumination early in the day will be under low illumination late in the day and vice versa because of the motion of the sun across the sky. This daily exchange between the lighted state and the shaded state of a given surface is an important but little noted fact about the environment. It will be further elaborated in Chapter 5.

High and Low Absorption of Light

The seventh law says that, of the illumination falling on a surface, more or less will be absorbed by it depending on the chemical composition of the substance. Certain substances like pure carbon absorb much, and others like chalk absorb little. This is why carbon is black and chalk is white.

In optics there are two alternatives to the absorption of light by a surface, transmission and reflection. For present purposes, only reflection will be emphasized, because most surfaces are not transparent like optical glass and pure water but are opaque. And in any case no substance is perfectly transmit- ting. Only the medium itself ever approximates to perfect transmission. A surface that transmitted all the light falling on it would not be a surface but would be the mere ghost of a surface, like the insubstantial fiction of a geomet- rical plane. Sheets of polished glass and surfaces of still water only transmit enough of the incident light to be called transparent.

Characteristic Reflectance

The eighth law is a corollary of the seventh. It says that the amount of light bounced back into the medium, instead of being soaked up by the surface, is a characteristic of the substance. That is, the ratio of light reflected to light incident is a constant for any given compound or any homogeneous mixture. This ratio is the reflectance of a surface.

Coal has a low reflectance (about 5 percent), and snow has a high reflectance (about 80 percent). When substances of this sort are conglomerated, the surface will have what I called a pigment texture; it will be speckled. Granite and marble are substances whose surfaces are mottled or variegated in this way. 26 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Characteristic Spectral Reflectance

The ninth law of ecological surfaces asserts that a surface has a characteristic distribution of the reflectance ratios of the different wavelengths of the incident light and that these different distributions constitute different colors. The word color here means hue, or chromatic color as distinguished from achromatic color, the variation of black, gray, and white.

For animals and humans, the colors of surfaces as defined above are more important than the colors of sunsets, rainbows, and flames. They specify the ripeness or unripeness of fruit and distinguish the leaf from the flower. Along with the textures of those surfaces, the colors help to distinguish feathers and fur and skin. Surface color is inseparably connected with surface texture, for colors often go with textures, and colored objects are apt to be particolored. The color and texture of a surface together specify the composition of the substance, what it is made of, and this is important, as noted above.

The Qualities of Substantial Surfaces

A tentative classification of surfaces is now possible. First, there are luminous surfaces as distinguished from illuminated surfaces, those that emit light and those that do not. Second, there are more illuminated and less illuminated surfaces, those we call lighted and shaded. Third, there are the surfaces of volumes as distinguished from the surfaces of sheets and films. Fourth, there are opaque surfaces as distinguished from semitransparent and translucent surfaces; these forms of nonopaqueness will be further analyzed in Part II. Fifth, there are smooth surfaces and rough surfaces, the former being of two kinds, glossy and matte, and the latter having a great variety of forms of roughness. The distinction between smooth and rough is not as simple as it sounds but, in general, implies the mirror-reflecting of light at one extreme and the scatter- reflecting of light at the other. Sixth, there are homogeneous and conglomerated surfaces, the former being monocolored and the latter particolored; the "color" of a surface or of any bit of a surface refers to both its overall reflectance (black. gray, or white) and its spectral reflectance (hue). Finally, seventh, there are hard, intermediate, and soft surfaces, depending on the substance that underlies the surface.

These seven modes or qualities take the place of the so-called modes of appearance of color (Beck, 1972). And, when surface layout is also considered, they take the place of the so-called qualities of objects, color on the one hand and "form, size, position, solidity, duration, and motion"on the other. These latter are John Locke's "primary"qualities, those that were supposed to be"in the objects"instead of merely "in us." This distinction between primary and secondary qualities is quite unnecessary and is wholly rejected in the above description. Medium, Substances, Surfaces 27

Summary

We live in an environment consisting of substances that are more or less substan- tial; of a medium, the gaseous atmosphere; and of the surfaces that separate the substances from the medium. We do not live in"space."

The medium permits unimpeded locomotion from place to place, and it also permits the seeing, smelling, and hearing of the substances at all places. Locomotion and behavior are continually controlled by the activities of seeing, smelling, and hearing, together with touching.

The substances of the environment need to be distinguished. A powerful way of doing so is by seeing their surfaces.

A surface has characteristic properties that can persist or change, such as its layout, its texture, the property of being lighted or shaded, and the property of reflecting a certain fraction of the illumination falling on it.
