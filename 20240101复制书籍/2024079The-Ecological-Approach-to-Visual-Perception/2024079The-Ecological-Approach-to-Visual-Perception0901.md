## 09. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception

Persisting Layout

Direct perception is what one gets from seeing Niagara Falls, say, as distin- guished from seeing a picture of it. The latter kind of perception is mediated. So when I assert that perception of the environment is direct, I mean that it is not mediated by retinal pictures, neural pictures, or mental pictures. Direct perception is the activity of getting information from the ambient array of light. I call this a process of information pickup that involves the exploratory activity of looking around, getting around, and looking at things. This is quite different from the supposed activity of getting information from the inputs of the optic nerves, whatever they may prove to be.

The evidence for direct visual perception has accumulated slowly, over many years. The very idea had to be developed, the results of old experiments had to be reinterpreted, and new experiments had to be carried out. The next two chapters are devoted to the experimental evidence.

The experiments will be considered under three main headings: first, the direct perception of surface layout; second, the direct perception of changing surface layout; and third, the direct perception of the movements of the self. This chapter is devoted to the direct perception of surface layout.

Evidence for the Direct Perception of Surface Layout

Some thirty years ago, during World War II, psychologists were trying to apply the theory of depth perception to the problems of aviation, especially the problem of how a flier lands an airplane. Pilots were given tests for depth perception, and there was controversy as to whether depth perception was learned or innate. The same tests are still being given, and the same disagree- ment continues. 140 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The theory of depth perception assumes that the third dimension of space is lost in the two-dimensional retinal image. Perception must begin with form perception, the flat patchwork of colors in the visual field. But there are suppos- edly cues for depth, which, if they are utilized, will add a third dimension to the flat visual field. A list of the cues for depth is given in most psychology textbooks: linear perspective, apparent size, superposition, light and shade, relative motion, aerial perspective, accommodation (the monocular cues), along with binocular disparity and convergence (the binocular cues). You might suppose that adequate tests could be made of a prospective flier's ability to use these cues and that exper- iments could be devised to find out whether or not they were learned.

The trouble was that none of the tests based on the cues for depth predicted the success or failure of a student pilot, and none of the proposals for improving depth perception by training made it any easier to learn to fly. I was deeply puzzled by this fact. The accepted theory of depth perception did not work. It did not apply to problems where one might expect it to apply. I began to suspect that the traditional list of cues for depth was inadequate. And in the end I came to believe that the whole theory of depth perception was false.

I suggested a new theory in a book on what I called the visual world (Gibson. 1950b). I considered "the possibility that there is literally no such thing as a perception of space without the perception of a continuous background surface" (p. 6). I called this a ground theory of space perception to distinguish it from the air theory that seemed to underlie the old approach. The idea was that the world consisted of a basic surface with adjoining surfaces, not of bodies in empty air. The character of the visual world was given not by objects but by the back- ground of the objects. Even the space of the airplane pilot, I said, was determ- ined by the ground and the horizon of the earth, not by the air through which he flies. The notion of space of three dimensions with three axes for Cartesian coordinates was a great convenience for mathematics, I suggested, but an abstraction that had very little to do with actual perception.

I would now describe the ground theory as a theory of the layout of surfaces. By layout, I mean the relations of surfaces to the ground and to one another, their arrangement. The layout includes both places and objects, together with other features. The theory asserts that the perception of surface layout is direct. This means that perception does not begin with two-dimensional form perception. Hence, there is no special kind of perception called depth perception, and the third dimension is not lost in the retinal image since it was never in the environ- ment to begin with. It is a loose term. If depth means the dimension of an object that goes with height and width, there is nothing special about it. Height becomes depth when the object is seen from the top, and width becomes depth when the object is seen from the side. If depth means distance from here, then it involves self-perception and is continually changing as the observer moves about. The theory of depth perception is based on confusion and perpetuated by the fallacy of the retinal picture. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 141

I now say that there is information in ambient light for the perception of the layout of surfaces but not that there are cues or clues for the perception of depth. The traditional list of cues is worthless if perception does not begin with a flat picture. I tried to reformulate the list in 1950 as "gradients and steps of retinal stimulation"(Gibson, 1950b, pp. 137 ff.). The hypothesis of gradients was a good beginning, but the reformulation failed. It had the great handicap of being based on physiological optics and the retinal image instead of ecological optics and the ambient array.

Such is the hypothesis of the direct perception of surface layout. What is the evidence to support it? Some experiments had been carried out even before 1950, outdoor experiments in the open air instead of laboratory experiments with spots of light in a darkroom, but they were only a beginning (Gibson, 1947). Much more experimental evidence has accumulated in the last twenty- five years.

The Psychophysics of Space and Form Perception

The studies to be described were thought of as psychophysical experiments at the time they were performed. There was to be a new psychophysics of percep- tion as well as the old psychophysics of sensation. For I thought I had discovered that there were stimuli for perceptions in much the same way that there were known to be stimuli for sensations. This now seems to me a mistake. I failed to distinguish between stimulation proper and stimulus information, between what happens at passive receptors and what is available to active perceptual systems. Traditional psychophysics is a laboratory discipline in which physical stimuli are applied to an observer. He is prodded with controlled and systemat- ically varied bits of energy so as to discover how his experience varies corres- pondingly. This procedure makes it difficult or impossible for the observer to extract invariants over time. Stimulus prods do not ordinarily carry informa- tion about the environment.

What I had in mind by a psychophysics of perception was simply the emphasis on perception as direct instead of indirect. I wanted to exclude an extra process of inference or construction. I meant (or should have meant) that animals and people sense the environment, not in the meaning of having sensations but in the meaning of detecting. When I asserted that a gradient in the retinal image was a stimulus for perception, I meant only that it was sensed as a unit; it was not a collection of points whose separate sensations had to be put together in the brain. But the concept of the stimulus was not clear to me. I should have asserted that a gradient is stimulus information. For it is first of all an invariant property of an optic array. I should not have implied that a percept was an automatic response to a stimulus, as a sense impression is supposed to be. For even then I realized that perceiving is an act, not a response, an act of attention, not a trig- gered impression, an achievement, not a reflex. 142 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

So what I should have meant by a "psychophysical"theory of perception in 1950 and by perception as a "function of stimulation"in the essay I wrote in 1959 (Gibson, 1959) was the hypothesis of a one-stage process for the percep- tion of surface layout instead of a two-stage process of first perceiving flat forms and then interpreting the cues for depth.

I now believe that there is no such thing as flat-form perception, just as there is no such thing as depth perception. (There are drawings and pictures, to be sure, but these are not "forms," as I will explain in Part IV. The theory of form perception in psychology is no less confused than the theory of depth percep- tion.) But this was not clear when I wrote my book in 1950, where I promised not only a psychophysics of space perception in Chapter 5 but also a psychophys- ical approach to form perception in Chapter 10. This sounded promising and progressive. Visual outline forms, I suggested, are not unique entities. "They could be arranged in a systematic way such that each form would differ only gradually and continuously from all others" (Gibson, 1950b, p. 193). What counts is not the form as such but the dimensions of variation of form. And psychophys- ical experiments could be carried out if these dimensions were isolated.

Here was the germ of the modern hypothesis of the distinctive features of graphic symbols. It also carries the faint suggestion of a much more radical hypothesis, that what the eye picks up is a sequential transformation, not a form. The study of form discrimination by psychophysical methods has flour- ished in the last thirty years. W. R. Garner, Julian Hochberg, Fred Attneave, and others have achieved the systematic variation of outline forms and patterns in elegant ways(e.g., Garner, 1974). My objection to this research is that it tells us nothing about perceiving the environment. It still assumes that vision is simplest when there is a form on the retina that copies a form on a surface facing the retina. It perpetuates the fallacy that form perception is basic. It holds back the study of invariants in a changing array. But the hypothesis that forms are directly perceived does not upset the orthodoxies of visual theory as does the hypothesis that invariants are directly perceived, and hence it is widely accepted.

The psychophysical approach to surface perception is much more radical than the psychophysical approach to form perception, and it has not been widely accepted over the last twenty-five years. Has its promise been fulfilled? Some experiments can be summarized, and the evidence should be pulled together. Experiments on the Perception of a Surface as Distinguished

from Nothing

Metzger's Experiment

Is tridimensional space perception based on bidimensional sensations to which the third dimension is added, or is it based on surface perception? The first experiment bearing on this issue is that of W. Metzger in 1930. He faced the Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 143 eyes of his observer with a large, dimly lighted plaster wall, which rendered the light coming to the visual system unfocusable. Neither eye could accommodate, and probably the eyes could not converge. The total field (Ganzfeld) was, as he put it, homogeneous. Under high illumination, the observer simply perceived the wall, and the outcome was so obvious as to be uninteresting. But under low illumination, the fine-grained texture of the surface was no longer registered by a human eye, and the observer reported seeing what he called a fog or haze or mist of light. He certainly did not see a surface in two dimensions, and therefore Metzger was tempted to conclude that he saw something in three dimensions; that is, he was perceiving "space."

But I did not see depth in the "mist of light." Another way to get a homo- geneous field is to confront the eyes with a hemisphere of diffusing glass highly illuminated from the outside (Gibson and Dibble, 1952). A better way is to cover each eye with a fitted cap of strongly diffusing translucent material worn like a pair of goggles (Gibson and Waddell, 1952). The structure of the entering light, the optical texture, can thus be eliminated at any level of intensity. What my observers and I saw under these conditions could better be described as "nothing"in the sense of "no thing."It was like looking at the sky. There was no surface and no object at any distance. Depth was not present in the experi- ence but missing from it. What the observer saw, as I would now put it, was an empty medium.

The essence of Metzger's experiment and its subsequent repetitions is not the plaster wall or the panoramic surface or the diffusing glass globe or the eye- caps. The experiment provides discontinuities in the light to an eye at one extreme and eliminates them at the other. The purpose of the experiment is to control and vary the projective capacity oflight. This must be isolated from the stimulating capacity of light. Metzger's experiment points to the distinction between an optic array with structure and a nonarray without structure. To the extent that the array has structure it specifies an environment.

A number of experiments using a panoramic surface under low illumination have been carried out, although the experimenters did not always realize what they were doing. But all the experiments involved more or less faint discon- tinuities in the light to the eye. What the observers said they saw is complex and hard to describe. One attempt was made by W. Cohen in 1957, and the other experiments have been surveyed by L. L. Avant (1965). It is fair to say that there are intermediate perceptions between seeing nothing and seeing something as the discontinuities become stronger. These are the polar opposites of perception that are implied by Metzger's experiment, not the false opposites of seeing in two dimensions and seeing in three dimensions.

The confusion over whether there is or is not "depth"in Metzger's luminous fog is what led me to think that the whole theory of depth, distance, the third dimension, and space is misconceived. The important result is the neglected one that a surface is seen when the array has structure, that is, differences in 144 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

different directions. A perfectly flat surface in front of the eyes is still a layout, that is, a wall. And that is all that "seeing in two dimensions" can possibly mean.

The Experiment with Translucent Eye-Caps

Eliminating optical texture from the light entering the eye by means of trans- lucent diffusing goggles is an experiment that has been repeated many times. The observer is blind, not to light, for the photoreceptors are still stimulated, but to the environment, for the ocular system is inactivated; its adjustments are frustrated. The observer cannot look at or look around, and I shall devote a chapter to this activity later. The eye-caps have also been adapted for experi- ments on the development of vision in young animals. It was known that when diurnal animals such as primates were reared from birth in complete darkness they were blind by certain criteria when brought into an illuminated environ- ment (although this was not true of nocturnal animals whose ancestors were used to getting around in the dark). Now it was discovered that animals deprived of optical structure but not of optical stimulation were also partly blind when the eye-caps were removed. Crudely speaking, they could not use their eyes properly. Anatomical degeneration of the photoreceptors had not occurred, as with the animals reared in the dark, but the exploratory adjust- ments of the visual system had not developed normally. The experiments are described in Chapter 12 of Perceptual Learning and Development by Eleanor J. Gibson(1969).

Experiments with a Sheet of Glass

It is fairly well known that a clean sheet of plate glass that projects no reflections or highlights to the observer's eye is, as we say, invisible. This fact is not self- explanatory, but it is very interesting. It means that one perceives air where a material surface exists, because air is specified by the optic array. I have seen people try to walk through plate-glass doors to their great discomfiture and deer try to jump through plate-glass windows with fatal results.

A perfectly clear sheet of glass transmits both light considered as energy and an array of light considered as information. A frosted or pebbled sheet of glass transmits optical energy but not optical information. The clear sheet can be seen through, as we say, but the frosted sheet cannot. The latter can be seen, but the former cannot. An imperceptible sheet of glass can be made increasingly perceptible by letting dust or powder fall on it or by spattering it. Even the faintest specks can specify the surface. In this intermediate case, the sheet trans- mits both the array from the layout behind the glass and the array from the glass itself. We say that we see the farther surface through the glass surface. The optical structure of one is mixed or interspersed with the optical structure of the other. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 145 The transparency of the near surface, more properly its semitransparency, is then perceived (Gibson, 1976). One sees two surfaces, separated in depth, in the same direction from here or, better, within the same visual solid angle of the ambient array. At least one sees them separated if the interspersed structures are different, or if the elements of one move relative to the elements of the other (E. J. Gibson, Gibson, Smith, and Flock, 1959).

Many of the above assertions are based on informal experiments that have not been published. But the reader can check them for himself with little trouble. I conclude that a surface is experienced when the structural informa- tion to specify it is picked up.

Experiments with a Pseudotunnel

In the case of a sheet of glass, a surface may exist and go unperceived if it is not specified. In the next experiment, a surface may be nonexistent but may be perceived if it is specified. The pseudosurface in this case was not flat and frontal but was a semienclosure, a cylindrical tunnel viewed from one end. I called it an optical tunnel to suggest that the surface was not material or substan- tial but was produced by the light to the eye. Another way of describing it would be to say that it was a virtual but not a real tunnel.

The purpose of the experiment was to provide information for the percep- tion of the inside surface of a cylinder without the ordinary source of this information, the inside surface of a cylinder. I would now call this a display. The fact that the perception was illusory is incidental. I wanted to elicit a synthetic perception, and I, therefore, had to synthesize the information. It was an exper- iment in perceptual psychophysics, more exactly, psycho-optics. The observers were fooled, to be sure, but that was irrelevant. There was no information in the array to specify that it was a display. This situation, I shall argue, is very rare.

My collaborators and I (Gibson, Purdy, and Lawrence, 1955)generated a visual solid angle of about 30° at the point of observation. This array consisted of alternating dark and light rings nested within one another, separated by abrupt circular contours. The number of rings and contours from the periphery to the center of the array could be varied. At one extreme there were thirty-six contours, and at the other seven.

Thus the mean density of the contrasts in the array was varied from fine to coarse. The gradient of this density could also be varied; normally the density increased from the periphery toward the center.

The source of this display, the apparatus, was a set of large, very thin, plastic sheets, each hiding the next, with a one-foot hole cut in the center of each. They were indirectly illuminated from above or below. The contours in the array were caused by the edges of the sheets. The texture of the plastic was so fine as to be invisible. Black and white sheets could be hung in alternation one behind another. or. as a control. all-black or all-white surfaces could be 146 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.1 The optic array coming to the eye from the optical tunnel.

There are nine contrasts in this cross-section of the array, that is, nine transitions of luminous intensity. The next figure shows a longitudinal section. The point of obser- vation for the figure on the left is centered with the tunnel, whereas the point of obser- vation for the figure on the right is to the right of center. (From J. J. Gibson, J. Purdy, and L. Lawrence: "A Method of Controlling Stimulation for the Study of Space Perception: The Optical Tunnel,"Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1955, 50, 1-14.

FIGURE 9.2 A longitudinal section of the optical tunnel shown in Figure 9.1.

Nine plastic sheets are shown, black and white alternating, with the cut edges of the nine holes aligned. The increase in the density of the contrasts from the peri- phery to the center of the array is evident. (From J. J. Gibson, J. Purdy, and L. Lawrence: "A Method of Controlling Stimulation for the Study of Space Perception: The Optical Tunnel," Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1955，50，1-14. Copyright 1955 by the American Psychological Association. Reprinted by permission.) Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 147 displayed. The observers looked into these holes from a booth, and extreme precautions were taken to prevent them from having any preconception of what they would see.

The principal result was as follows. When all-black or all-white surfaces were used, the observers saw nothing; the area within the first hole was described as a hazy or misty fog, a dark or light film, without obvious depth. At the other extreme, when thirty-six dark and light rings were displayed, all observers saw a continuous striped cylindrical surface, a solid tunnel. No edges were seen, and "a ball could be rolled from the far end to the entrance."

When nineteen contrasts were displayed, two-thirds of the observers described a solid tunnel. When thirteen contrasts were displayed, half did so: and when seven contrasts were displayed, only one-third did so. In each case, the remainder said they saw either segments of surface with air in between or a series of circular edges (which was, of course, correct). With fewer contrasts, the experience became progressively less continuous and substantial. The prox- imity of these contours had proved to be crucial. Surfaciness depended on their mean density in the array.

What about the cylindrical shape of the surface, the receding layout of the tunnel? This could be altered in a striking way and the tunnel converted into a flat surface like an archery target with rings around a bull's-eye simply by rearranging the sheets in the way illustrated. The gradient of increasing prox- imity toward the center of the array gives way to an equal proximity. But the target surface instead of the tunnel surface appeared only if the observer's head was fixed and one eye was covered, that is, if the array was frozen and single. If the head was moved or the other eye used, the tunnel shape was again seen. The frozen array specified a flat target, but the dual or transforming array specified a receding tunnel. This is only one of many experiments in which perception with monocular fixed vision is exceptional.

Conclusion

These experiments with a dimly lighted wall, with translucent eye-caps, with a sheet of glass, and with a pseudotunnel seem to show that the perception of surfaciness depends on the proximity to one another of discontinuities in the optic array. A surface is the interface between matter in the gaseous state and matter in the liquid or solid state. A surface comes to exist as the matter on one side of the interface becomes more substantial (Chapter 2). The medium is insubstantial. Mists, clouds, water, and solids are increasingly substantial. These substances are also increasingly opaque, except for a substance like glass, which is rare in nature. What these experiments have done is to vary systematically the optical information for the perception of substantiality and opacity. (But see the next chapter on the perception of coherence.) 148 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.3 An arrangement that provides an array with a constant density of contrasts from periphery to center.

Only the first seven apertures are shown. The observer does not see a tunnel with this display but a flat surface with concentric rings, something like an archery target, so long as the head is immobile and one eye is covered. (From J. J. Gibson, J. Purdy, and L. Lawrence: "A Method of Controlling Stimulation for the Study ofSpace Perception: The Optical Tunnel," Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1955，50，1-14. Copyright 1955 by the American Psychological Association. Reprinted by permission.)

The experiment with the pseudotunnel also seems to show that the percep- tion of a surface as such entails the perception of its layout, such as the front- facing layout of a wall or the slanting layout of a tunnel. Both are kinds of layout, and the traditional distinction between two-dimensional and three- dimensional vision is a myth.

Experiments on the Perception of the Surface of Support

The ground outdoors or the floor indoors is the main surface of support. Animals have to be supported against gravity. If the layout of surfaces is to be substituted for space in the theory of perception, this fundamental surface should get first consideration. How is it perceived? Animals like us can always feel the surface of support except when falling freely. But we can also see the surface of support under our feet if we are, in fact, supported. The ground is always specified in the lower portion of the ambient array. The standing infant can always see it and can always see her feet hiding parts of it. This is a law of ecological optics.

The Glass Floor

A floor can be experimentally modified. When the "visual cliff" was being constructed for experiments with young animals by E. J. Gibson and R. D. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 149 Walk (1960), observations were made with a large sheet of glass that was hori- zontal instead of vertical, a glass floor instead of a glass wall. The animal or child can be put down on this surface under two conditions: when it is visible, by virtue of textured paper placed just under the glass, and when it is invisible, with the paper placed far below the glass. The glass affords support under both conditions but provides optical information for support only under the first. There is mechanical contact with the feet in both cases but optical information for contact with the feet only in the first.

The animals or babies tested in this experiment would walk or crawl normally when they could both see and feel the surface but would not do so when they could only feel the surface; in the latter case, they froze, crouched, and showed signs of discomfort. Some animals even adopted the posture they would have when falling (E. J. Gibson and Walk, 1960, pp. 65-66). The conclusion seems to be that some animals require optical information for support along with the inertial and tactual information in order to walk normally. For my part, I should feel very uncomfortable if I had to stand on a large observation platform with a transparent floor through which the ground was seen far below.

The optical information in this experiment, I believe, is contradictory to the haptic information. One sees oneself as being up in the air, but one feels oneself in contact with a surface of support and, of course, one feels the normal pull of gravity in the vestibular organ. In such cases of contradictory or conflicting information, the psychologist cannot predict which will be picked up.The perceptual outcome is uncertain.

Note that the perception of the ground and the coperception of the self are inseparable in this situation. One's body in relation to the ground is what gets attention. Perception and proprioception are complementary. But the commonly accepted theories of space perception do not bring out this fact.

The Visual Cliff

The visual cliff experiments of E. J. Gibson, R. D. Walk, and subsequently others are very well known. They represented a new approach to the ancient puzzle of depth perception, and the results obtained with newborn or dark- reared animals were surprising because they suggested that depth perception was innate. But the sight of a cliff is not a case of perceiving the third dimension. One perceives the affordance of its edge. A cliff is a feature of the terrain, a highly significant, special kind of dihedral angle in ecological geometry, a falling-off place. The edge at the top of a cliff is dangerous. It is an occluding edge. But is has the special character of being an edge of the surface of support, unlike the edge of a wall. One can safely walk around the edge of a wall but not off the edge of a cliff. To perceive a cliffis to detect a layout but, more than that, it is to detect an affordance, a negative affordance for locomotion, a place where the surface of support ends. 150 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

An affordance is for a species of animal, a layout relative to the animal and commensurate with its body. A cliff is a drop-off that is large relative to the size of the animal, and a step is a drop-off that is small relative to its size. A falling-off edge is dangerous, but a stepping-down edge is not. What animals need to perceive is not layout as such but the affordances of the layout, as emphasized in the last chapter. Consider the difference between the edge of a horizontal surface and the edge of a vertical surface, the edge of a floor and the edge of a wall. You go over the former whereas you can go around the latter. Both are dihedral angles, and both are occluding edges. But the meanings of the two kinds of "depth"are entirely different.

Gibson and Walk (1960; Walk and Gibson, 1961) constructed a virtual cliff with the glass-floor apparatus. They tested animals and babies to determine whether or not they would go forward over the virtual cliff. Actually, they provided two edges on either side of a narrow platform, one a falling-off edge and the other a stepping-down edge appropriate to the species of animal being tested. The animals' choices were recorded. Nearly all terrestrial animals chose the shallow edge instead of the deep one.

The results have usually been discussed in terms of depth perception and the traditional cues for depth. But they are more intelligible in terms of the percep- tion of layout and affordances. The separation in depth at an edge of the surface of support is not at all the same thing as the depth dimension of abstract space.

The real object is held up in the air by a hidden rod attached to a heavy base. The virtual object appears to be resting on the ground where the bottom edge of the real object hides the ground, so long as vision is monocular and frozen. One sees a concave corner, not an occluding edge. Because the virtual object is at twice the distance of the real object, it is seen as twice the size. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 151 As for innate versus learned perception, it is much more sensible to assume an innate capacity to notice falling-off places in terrestrial animals than it is to assume that they have innate ideas or mental concepts of geometry.

An Object Resting on the Ground

I suggested that one sees the contact of his feet with the ground. This is equally true for other objects than feet. We see whether an object is on the ground or up in the air. How is this contact with or separation from the ground perceived? The answer is suggested by an informal experiment described in my book on the visual world (Gibson, 1950b, Fig. 72，pp. 178 ff.), which might be called the invisibly-supported-object experiment. I did not clearly understand it at the time, but the optics of occluding edges now makes it more intelligible.

A detached object can be attached to a long rod that is hidden to the observer. The rod can be lowered by the experimenter so that the obiect rests on the ground or raised so that it stands up in the air. The object can be a cardboard rectangle or trapezoid or a ball, but it must be large enough to hide the rod and its base. An observer who stands at the proper position and looks with two eyes, or with one eye and a normally moving head, perceives a resting object as resting on the surface of support and a raised object as raised above the surface of support. The size and distance of the object are seen correctly. But an observer who looks with one eye and a fixed head, through a peephole or with a biting board, gets an entirely different perception. A resting object is seen correctly, but a raised object is also seen to be resting on the surface. It is seen at the place where its edge hides the texture of the surface. It appears farther away and larger than it really is.

This illusion is very interesting. It appears only with monocular arrested vision-a rare and unnatural kind of vision. The increments and decrements of the texture of the ground at the edges of the object have been eliminated, both those of one eye relative to the other and those that are progressive in time at each eye. In traditional theory, the cues of binocular and motion parallax are absent. But it is just these increments and decrements of the ground texture that specify the separation of object from ground. The absence of this accretion/dele- tion specifies contact of the object with the ground. A surface is perceived to "stand up"or "stand out"from the surface that extends behind it only to the extent that the gap is specified. And this depends on seeing from different points of observation, either two points of observation at the same time or different points of observation at different times.

A flat surface that "goes back to" or "lies flat on" the ground will seem to have a different size, shape, and even reflectance than it has when it stands forth in the air. This feature of the illusion is also very interesting, and I have demon- strated it many times. The first published study of it is that of J. E. Hochberg and J. Beck (1954). 152 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Experiments with the Ground as Background

Investigators in the tradition of space perception and the cues for depth have

usually done experiments with a background in the frontal plane, that is, a

surface facing the observer, a wall, a screen, or a sheet of paper. A form in this

plane is most similar to a form on the retina, and extension in this plane might

be seen as a simple sensation. This follows from retinal image optics. But invest-

igators of environment perception do experiments with the ground as back-

ground, studying surfaces instead of forms, and using ecological optics. Instead

of studying distance in the air, they study recession along the ground. Distance

as such cannot be seen directly but can only be inferred or computed. Recession

along the ground can be seen directly.

Distance and Size Perception on the Ground

Although the linear perspective of a street in a painting had been known since

the Renaissance, and the converging appearance of a parallel alley of trees in a

landscape had been discussed since the eighteenth century, no one had ever

studied the perception of a naturally textured ground. Linear perspective was

an obvious cue for distance, but the gradient of density or proximity of the

texture of the ground was not so obvious. E. G. Boring has described the old

experiments with artificial alleys (1942，pp. 290-296)，but the first experiment

with an ordinary textured field outdoors, I believe, was published at the end of

World War II (Gibson, 1947). A plowed field without furrows receding almost

to the horizon was used. No straight edges were visible. This original experi-

ment required the judgment of the height of a stake planted in the field at some

distance up to half a mile. At such a distance the optical size of the elements of

texture and the optical size of the stake itself were extremely small.

Up until that time the unanimous conclusion of observers had been that

parallel lines were seen to converge and that objects were seen to be smaller"in

the distance." There was a tendency toward "size constancy"of objects, to be

sure, but it was usually incomplete. The assumption had always been that size

constancy must "break down." It was supposed that an object will cease to be

even visible at some eventual distance and that presumably it ceases to be visible

by way of becoming smaller. (See Gibson, 1950b, p. 183, for a statement of this

line of reasoning.) With the naive observers in the open field experiment,

however, the judgments of the size of the stake did not decrease, even when it

was a ten-minute walk away and becoming hard to make out. The judgments

became more variable with distance but not smaller. Size constancy did not break

down. The size of the object only became less definite with distance, not smaller. The implication of this result, I now believe, is that certain invariant ratios were

picked up unawares by the observers and that the size of the retinal image went

unnoticed. No matter how far away the object was, it intercepted or occluded the Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 153 same number of texture elements of the ground. This is an invariant ratio. For any distance the proportion of the stake extending above the horizon to that extending below the horizon was invariant. This is another invariant ratio. These invariants are not cues but information for direct size perception. The observers in this experiment were aviation trainees and were not interested in the perspective appearance of the terrain and the objects. They could not care less for the patch- work of colors in the visual field that had long fascinated painters and psycholo- gists. They were set to pick up information that would permit a size-match between the distant stake and one of a set of nearby stakes. The perception of the size and distance of an object on the ground had proved to be unlike the percep- tion of the size and distance of an object in the sky. The invariants are missing in the latter case. The silhouette of an airplane might be a fifty-foot fighter at a one- mile altitude or a hundred-foot bomber at a two-mile altitude. Airplane spotters could be trained to estimate altitude, but only by the method of recognizing the shape, knowing the size by having memorized the wingspan, and inferring the distance from the angular size. Errors were considerable at best. This kind of infer- ential knowledge is not characteristic of ordinary perception. Baron von Helmholtz called it "unconscious"inference even in the ordinary case, but I am skeptical.

Comparison of Stretches of Distance Along the Ground

The size of an object on the ground is not entirely separable from the sizes of the objects that compose the ground. The terrain is made of clods and particles of earth, or rocks and pebbles, or grass clumps and grass blades. These nested objects might have size constancy just as much as orthodox objects. In the next set of experiments on ground perception, the very distinction between size and distance breaks down. What had to be compared were not stakes or obiects but stretches of the ground itself, distances between markers placed by the experi- menter. In this case distances between here and there could be compared with distances between there and there. These open-field experiments were conducted by Eleanor J. Gibson (Gibson and Bergman, 1954; Gibson, Bergman, and Purdy, 1955; Purdy and Gibson, 1955).

Markers could be set down and moved anywhere in a level field of grass up to 350 yards away. The most interesting experiment of the series required the observer to bisect a stretch of distance. which could extend either from his feet to a marker or from one marker to another (Purdy and Gibson, 1955). A mobile marker on wheels had to be stopped by the observer at the halfway point. The ability to bisect a length had been tested in the laboratory with an adjustable stick called a Galton bar but not with a piece of ground on which the observer stood.

All observers could bisect a stretch of distance without difficulty and with some accuracy. The farther stretch could be matched to the nearer one, although the visual angles did not match. The farther visual angle was compressed 154 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

relative to the nearer, and its surface was, to use a vague term, foreshortened. But no constant error was evident. A stretch from here to there could be equated with a stretch from there to there. The conclusion must be that observers were not paying attention to the visual angles; they must have been noticing inform- ation. They might have been detecting, without knowing it, the amount of texture in a visual angle. The number of grass clumps projected in the farther half of a stretch of distance is exactly the same as the number projected in the nearer half. It is true that the optical texture of the grass becomes denser and more vertically compressed as the ground recedes from the observer, but the rule of equal amounts of texture for equal amounts of terrain remains invariant.

This is a powerful invariant. It holds for either dimension of the terrain, for width as well as for depth. In fact, it holds for any regularly textured surface whatever, that is, any surface of the same substance. And it holds for walls and ceilings as well as for floors. To say that a surface is regularly textured is only to assume that bits of the substance tend to be evenly spaced. They do not have to be perfectly regular like crystals in a lattice but only "stochastically"regular.

The implications of this experiment on fractionating a stretch of the ground are radical and far-reaching. The world consists not only of distances from here, my world, but also of distances from there, the world of another person. These intervals seem to be strikingly equivalent.

The rule of equal amounts of texture for equal amounts of terrain suggests that both size and distance are perceived directly. The old theory that the perceiver allows for the distance in perceiving the size of something is unneces- sary. The assumption that the cues for distance compensate for the sensed small- ness of the retinal image is no longer persuasive. Note that the pickup of the amount of texture in a visual solid angle of the optic array is not a matter of counting units, that is, of measuring with an arbitrary unit. The other experi- ments of this open-field series required the observers to make absolute judg- ments, so-called, of distances in terms of yards. They could learn to do so readily enough (E. J. Gibson and Bergman, 1954； E. J. Gibson, Bergman, and Purdy, 1955), but it was clear that one had to see the distance before one could apply a number to it.

Observations of the Ground and the horizon

When the terrain is flat and open, the horizon is in the ambient optic array. It is a great circle between the upper and the lower hemisphere separating the sky and the earth. But this is a limiting case. The farther stretches of the ground are usually hidden by frontal surfaces such as hills, trees, and walls. Even in an enclosure, however, there has to be a surface of support, a textured floor. The maximum coarseness of its optical texture is straight down, where the feet are, and the density increases outward from this center. These radial gradients projected from the surface of support increase with increasing size of the floor. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 155 The densities of texture do not become infinite except when there is an infin- itely distant horizon. Only at this limit is the optical structure of the array wholly compressed. But the gradients of density specify where the outdoors horizon would be, even in an enclosure. That is, there exists an implicit horizon even when the earth-sky horizon is hidden.

EVEN SPACING

The fact that the parts of the terrestrial environment tend to be "evenly

spaced"was noted in my early book on the visual world (Gibson, 1950b,

pp. 77-78). This is equivalent to the rule of equal amounts of texture for

equal amounts of terrain. The fact can be stated in various ways. However

stated, it seems to be a fact that can be seen, not necessarily an intellectual

concept of abstract space including numbers and magnitudes. Ecological

geometry does not have to be learned from textbooks.

The concept of a vanishing point comes from artificial perspective, conver- ging parallels, and the theory of the picture plane. The vanishing limit of optical structure at the horizon comes from natural perspective, ecological optics, and the theory of the ambient optic array. The two kinds of perspective should not be confused, although they have many principles in common (Chapter 5).

The terrestrial horizon is thus an invariant feature of terrestrial vision, an invariant of any and all ambient arrays, at any and all points of observation. The horizon never moves, even when every other structure in the light is changing. This stationary great circle is, in fact, that to which all optical motions have reference. It is neither subjective nor objective; it expresses the reciprocity of observer and environment; it is an invariant of ecological optics.

The horizon is the same as the skyline only in the case of the open ground or the open ocean. The earth-sky contrast may differ from the true horizon because of hills or mountains. The horizon is perpendicular to the pull of gravity and to the two poles of the ambient array at the centers of the two hemi- spheres; in short, the horizon is horizontal. With reference to this invariant, all other objects, edges, and layouts in the environment are judged to be either upright or tilted. In fact, the observer perceives himself to be in an upright or tilted posture relative to this invariant. (For an early and more complex discussion of visual uprightness and tilt in terms of the retinal image, see Gibson, 1952, on the "phenomenal vertical.")

The facts about the terrestrial horizon are scarcely mentioned in traditional optics. The only empirical study of it is one by H. A. Sedgwick (1973)based on ecological optics. He shows how the horizon is an important source of invariant information for the perception of all kinds of objects. All terrestrial objects, for 156 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.5 The base of each pillar covers the same amount of the texture of the ground.

The width of each pillar is that of one paving stone. The pillars will be seen to have the same width if this information is picked up. The height of each pillar is specified by a similar invariant, the "horizon-ratio"relation, described later.

example, of the same height are cut by the horizon in the same ratio, no matter what the angular size of the object may be. This is the "horizon ratio relation" in its simplest form. Any two trees or poles bisected by the horizon are the same height, and they are also precisely twice my eye-height. More complex ratios specify more complex layouts. Sedgwick showed that judgments of the sizes of objects represented in pictures were actually determined by these ratios.

The perceiving of what might be called eye level on the walls, windows, trees, poles, and buildings of the environment is another case of the comple- mentarity between seeing the layout of the environment and seeing oneself in the environment. The horizon is at eye level relative to the furniture of the earth. But this is my eye level, and it goes up and down as I stand and sit. If I want my eye level, the horizon, to rise above all the clutter of the environment, I must climb up to a high place. The perception of here and the perception of infinitely distant from here are linked.

Experiments on the Perception of Slant

Experiments on the direct perception of layout began in 1950. From the begin- ning, the crucial importance of the density of optical texture was evident. How could it be varied systematically in an experiment? Along with the outdoor experiments, I wanted to try indoor experiments in the laboratory. I did not Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 157 then understand ambient light but only the retinal image, and this led me to experiment with texture density in a window or picture. The density could be increased upward in the display (or downward or rightward or leftward), and the virtual surface would then be expected to slant upward (or downward or whatever). The surface should slant away in the direction of increasing texture density; it should be inclined from the frontal plane at a certain angle that corresponded to the rate of change of density, the gradient of density. Every piece of surface in the world, I thought, had this quality of slant (Gibson, 1950a). The slant of the apparent surface behind the apparent window could be judged by putting the palm of the hand at the same inclination from the frontal plane and recording it with an adjustable "palm board." This appeared to be a neat psychophysical experiment, for it isolated a variable, the gradient of density.

The first experiment (Gibson 1950a) showed that with a uniform density over the display the phenomenal slant is zero and that with increases of density in a given direction one perceives increasing slant in that direction. But the apparent slant was not proportional to the geometrically predicted slant. It was less than it should be theoretically. The experiment has been repeated with modifications by Gibson and J. Cornsweet (1952)，J. Beck and J. J. Gibson (1955)，R. Bergman and J. J. Gibson (1959), and many other investigators. It is not a neat psychophysical experiment. Phenomenal slant does not simply correspond to the gradient. The complexities of the results are described by H. R. Flock (1964, 1965)and by R. B. Freeman (1965).

What was wrong with these experiments? In consideration of the theory of layout, we can now understand it. The kind of slant studied was optical, not geographical, as noted by Gibson and Cornsweet (1952). It was relative to the frontal plane perpendicular to the line of sight, not relative to the surface of the earth, and was thus merely a new kind of depth, a quality added to each of the flat forms in the patchwork of the visual field. I had made the mistake of thinking that the experience of the layout of the environment could be compounded of all the optical slants of each piece of surface. I was thinking of slant as an absolute quality, whereas it is always relative. Convexities and concav- ities are not made up of elementary impressions of slant but are instead unitary features of the layout.

The impression of slant cannot be isolated by displaying a texture inside a window, for the perception of the occluding edge of the window will affect it; the surface is slanted relative to the surface that has the window in it. The separation of these surfaces is underestimated, as the experimental results showed.

The supposedly absolute judgment of the slant of a surface behind a window becomes more accurate when a graded decrease of velocity of the texture across the display is substituted for a graded increase of density of the texture, as demon- strated by Flock (1964). The virtual surface "stands back" from the virtual window. It slants away in the direction of decreasing flow of the texture but is 158 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.6 The invariant horizon ratio for terrestrial objects.

The telephone poles in this display are all cut by the horizon in the same ratio. The proportion differs for objects of different heights. The line where the horizon cuts the tree is just as high above the ground as the point of observation, that is, the height of the observer's eye. Hence everyone can see his own eye-height on the standing objects of the terrain.

perceived to be a rigidly moving surface if the flow gradient is mathematically appropriate. But this experiment belongs not with experiments on surface layout but with those on changing surface layout, and these experiments will be described later.

Is There Evidence Against the Direct Perception of

Surface Layout?

There are experiments, of course, that seem to go against the theory of a direct perception of layout and to support the opposite theory of a mediated perception of layout. The latter theory is more familiar. It asserts that perception is medi- ated by assumptions, preconceptions, expectations, mental images, or any of a dozen other hypothetical mediators. The demonstrations of Adelbert Ames, once very popular, are well known for being interpreted in this way, especially the Distorted Room and the Rotating Trapezoidal Window.

These demonstrations are inspired by the argument from equivalent configura- tions. A diagram illustrating equivalent configurations is given in Figure 9.7. The argument is that many possible objects can give rise to one retinal image and that hence a retinal image cannot specify the object that gave rise to it. Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 159 But the image, according to the argument, is all one has for information. The perception of an object, therefore, requires an assumption about which of the many possible objects that could exist gave rise to the present image (or to the visual solid angle corresponding to it). The argument is supposed to apply to each of a collection of objects in space.

A distorted room with trapezoidal surfaces can be built so as to give rise to a visual solid angle at the point of observation identical with the solid angle from a normal rectangular room. Or a trapezoidal window with trapezoids for windowpanes can be built and made to rotate so that its changing visual solid angle is identical with the changing solid angle from a rectangular window slanted 45° away from the real distorted window. The window is always one- eighth of a rotation behind itself, as it were. A single and stationary point of observation is taken for granted. An observer who looks with one eye and a stationary head misperceives the trapezoidal surfaces and has the experience of a set of rectangular surfaces, a "virtual" form or window, instead of the actual plywood construction invented by the experimenter. Anomalies of perception result that are striking and curious. The eye has been fooled.

The explanation is that, in the absence of information, the observer has presup- posed (assumed, expected, or whatever) the existence of rectangular surfaces causing the solid angles at the eye. That is reasonable, but it is then concluded that presuppositions are necessary for perception in general, since a visual solid angle cannot specify its object. There will always be equivalent configurations for any solid angle or any set of solid angles at a point of observation.

The main fallacy in this conclusion, as the reader will recognize, is the generalization from peephole observation to ordinary observation, the assump- tion that because the perspective structure of an optic array does not specify the surface layout nothing in the array can specify the layout. The hypothesis of invariant structure that underlies the perspective structure and emerges clearly when there is a shift in the point of observation goes unrecognized. The fact is that when an observer uses two eyes and certainly when one looks from various points of view the abnormal room and the abnormal window are perceived for what they are, and the anomalies cease.

The demonstrations do not prove, therefore, that the perception of layout cannot be direct and must be mediated by preconceptions, as Adelbert Ames and his followers wanted to believe (Ittelson, 1952). Neither do the many other demonstrations that, over the centuries, have purported to prove it.

The diagram of equivalent configurations illustrates one of the perplexities inherent to the retinal image theory of perception: if many different objects can give rise to the same stimulus, how do we ever perceive an object? The other half of the puzzle is this: if the same object can give rise to many different stimuli, how can we perceive the object? (Note that the second question implies a moving object but that neither question admits the fact of a moving observer. Koffka was perplexed by this dual puzzle (1935，pp. 228 ff) and many other experimenters have tried to 160 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 9.7 Equivalent configurations within the same visual solid angle.

This perspective drawing shows a rectangle and three transparent trapezoids, all of which fit within the envelope of the same visual solid angle. Thus all four quadrangles are theoretically equivalent for a single eye at a fixed point of observation. They are, however, ghosts, not surfaces.

resolve it, but without success (e.g., Beck and Gibson, 1955). The only way out, I now believe, is to abandon the dogma that a retinal stimulus exists in the form of a picture. What specifies an object are invariants that are themselves "formless."

Summary

The experiment of providing either structure or no structure in the light to an eye results in the perception of a surface or no surface. The difference is not between seeing in two dimensions and seeing in three dimensions, as earlier investigators supposed.

The closer together the discontinuities in an experimentally induced optic array, the greater is the "surfaciness"of the perception. This was true, at least, for a 30° array having seven contours at one extreme and thirty-six at the other.

Optical contact of one's body with the surface of support as well as mechan- ical contact seem to be necessary for some terrestrial animals if they are to stand and walk normally.

Perceiving the meaning of an edge in the surface of support, either a falling-off edge or a stepping-down edge, seems to be a capability that animals develop. This is not abstract depth perception but affordance perception.

Experiments on the perception of distance along the ground instead of distance through the air suggest that such perception is based on invariants in the array instead of cues. The rule of equal amounts of texture for equal amounts of terrain is one such invariant, and the horizon ratio relation is another. On this basis, the dimensions of things on the ground are perceived Experimental Evidence for Direct Perception 161 directly, and the old puzzle of the constancy of perceived size at different distances does not arise.

The fact of the terrestrial horizon in the ambient array should not be confused with the vanishing point of linear perspective in pictorial optics.

A series of experiments on the perception of the slant of a surface relative to the line of sight did not confirm the absolute gradient hypothesis. The implic- ation was that the slants of surfaces relative to one another and to the ground, the depth-shapes of the layout, are what get perceived.

Experiments based on the argument from equivalent configurations do not prove the need to have presuppositions in order to perceive the environment, since they leave out of account the fact that an observer normally moves about.
