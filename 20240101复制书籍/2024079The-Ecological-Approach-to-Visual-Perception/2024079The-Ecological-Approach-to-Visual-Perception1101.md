## 11. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and Its Implications for Perception

The facts of occlusion have been described in Chapter 5. They are part of ecological optics. But they were not recognized as facts until observations and experiments made them compelling. The experiments described in the last two chapters about surfaces, layout, change, and kinesthesis were radical enough, but they culminated in the most radical of all, in what I can only call the discovery of the occluding edge. This discovery is radical for the following reason. If it is true that there are places where opaque surfaces are seen one behind another, ifit is true that one can perceive a hidden surface, a paradox arises. For we are not now allowed to say that a hidden surface is perceived; we can only say that it is remembered. To be perceived, a thing must be "present to the senses"; it must be stimulating receptors. If it is not, it can only be experienced by means of an image; it can be recalled, imagined, conceived, or perhaps known, but not perceived. Such is the accepted doctrine, the theory of sensation-based percep- tion. If an occluded surface is perceived, the doctrine is upset.

Kaplan's Experiment

The crucial experiment, which was performed by G. A. Kaplan (1969)，involved kinetic, not static, displays of information. Each display was a motion picture shot of a random texture filling the screen, with a progressive deletion (or accre- tion)of the optical structure on one side of a contour and preservation of the structure on the other side. Photographs of a randomly textured paper were taken frame by frame, and successive frames were modified by careful paper- cutting. No contour was ever visible on any single frame, but progressive decre- ments of the texture were produced on one side of the invisible line by cutting off thin slices of paper in succession. Progressive increments of the texture could The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 181 be obtained by reversing the film. This particular kind of decrementing or incrementing of structure had not previously been achieved in a visual display.

In effect, a reversible disturbance of structure in a sample of the optic array had been isolated and controlled, a reversible transition. It is called a transition, not a transformation, since elements of structure were lost or gained and one- to-one correspondence was not preserved. What was perceived?

All observers, without exception, saw one surface going behind another (or coming from behind another) that was always concealing (or revealing) the first. Deletion always caused the perception of covering, and accretion always caused the perception of uncovering. The surface going out of sight was never seen to go out of existence, and the surface coming into sight was never seen to come into existence. In short, one surface was seen in a legitimate sense behind another at an occluding edge.

When the array was arrested by stopping the film, the edge perception ceased and a wholly continuous surface replaced it; when the optical transition was resumed, the edge perception began. The "motion"of the display as such, however, had nothing to do with the occluding edge; what counted was accre- tion or deletion and whether it was on one side or the other.

These results were striking. There were no uncertainties of judgment, no guessing as in the usual psychophysical experiment. What the observers saw was an edge, a cut edge, the edge of a sheet, and another surface behind it. But this depended on an array changing in time.

The surface that was being covered was seen to persist after being concealed, and the surface that was being uncovered was seen to pre-exist before being revealed. The hidden surface could not be described as remembered in one case or expected in the other. A better description would be that it was perceived retrospectively and prospectively. It is certainly reasonable to describe percep- tion as extending into the past and the future, but note that to do so violates the accepted doctrine that perception is confined to the present.

The crucial paper by Kaplan (1969) was published along with a motion picture film called The Change from Visible to Invisible: A Study of Optical Transitions Gibson, 1968)and an article having the same title by Gibson, Kaplan, Reynolds. and Wheeler (1969). A sharp distinction was made between going out of sight and going out of existence, and it was proposed that there is information to specify the two cases. I have described the information in Chapters 5 and 6. The former is a reversing transition, but the latter is not.

Anticipations of the Occluding Edge

The important result of Kaplan's experiment was not the perceiving of depth at the occluding edge but the perceiving of the persistence of the occluded surface. Depth perception requires no departure from traditional theories, but persistence perception is radically inconsistent with them. Only in the experimental work of 182 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Michotte had anything like persistence perception ever been hinted at (Michotte, Thinès, and Crabbé, 1964). He discovered what he called the "tunnel phenom- enon" or the "tunnel effect," the perception of a moving object during the interval between going into a tunnel and coming out of it. He ascribed it, however, not to progressive deletion and accretion of structure for going in and coming out but to a tendency for perception to be completed across a gap, in the style of gestalt theorizing. He did not realize how universal occlusion is during locomotion of the observer. But he was very much aware of the paradox of asserting that an object could be seen during an interval when there was no sensory basis for seeing it. The "screening"or "covering" of an object, he real- ized, was a fact of visual perception. But he could only suppose that the percep- tion of an object must somehow persist after the sensory input ends; he did not entertain the more radical hypothesis that the persistence of the object is perceived as a fact in its own right. There is a vast difference between the persistence of a percept and the perception of persistence.

It had long been recognized that in pictures, or other displays with a frozen array, the appearance of superposition could be obtained. Likewise, Rubin's discovery that a closed contour or figure in a display involved the appearance of a ground that seemed to extend without interruption behind the figure was well known. But these demonstrations were concerned with the seeing of contours and lines and the perceiving of forms, not with the perceiving of the occluding edges of surfaces in a cluttered terrestrial environment. They showed that what might be called depth-by-superposition could be induced by a picture but not that an occluded surface is seen to persist.

The occluding edge seems to have escaped notice in both physics and psychology. In truth, it is not a fact of physics or a fact of psychology as these disciplines have been taught. It depends on the combined facts of a surface layout and a point of observation.

The Theory of Reversible Occlusion

The theory of reversible occlusion was formulated in Chapter 5 in terms of what I called projected and unprojected surfaces for an ambient optic array at a given time. Reversible occlusion was said to be a consequence of the reversibility of locomotions and motions in the medium, and this was contrasted in Chapter 6 with the unreversibility of changes such as disintegration, dissolution, and the change from a solid to a liquid or a gas. These changes, I said, were not such that the waning of a surface was the temporal inverse of waxing, not such that if a film of one event were run backward it would represent the opposite event (Gibson and Kaushall, 1973).

Then, in Chapter 7 on the self, the principle of reversible occlusion was extended to the head turning of the observer, and the margins of the field of view were compared to the occluding edges of a window. The principle is The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 183 widely applicable. It would be useful to bring together all this theorizing and to summarize it in a list of propositions.

Terminology

The reader should be reminded again that many pairs of terms can be used to denote what I have called occlusion. In what follows, the words hidden and unhidden are chosen to have a general meaning (although they have the unwanted flavor of buried treasure!). Unprojected and projected, the terms used in Chapter 5, are all right except for the implication of throwing an image on a screen, which gives precisely the wrong emphasis. Covered and uncovered are possible terms, or screened and unscreened, and these were employed by Michotte. Other possibilities are concealed and revealed, or undisclosed and disclosed. All these terms refer to various kinds of occlusion. The most general terms are out of sight and in sight, which contrast with out of existence and in existence. It should be kept in mind that all these terms refer to reversible transitions, that is, to becoming hidden or unhidden, to going out of sight or coming into sight. Terms that should not be employed are disappear and appear. Although in common use, these words are ambiguous and promote sloppy thinking about the psychology of percep- tion. The same is true of the words visible and invisible.

There seem to be a number of different ways of going out of sight, some not by occlusion and some by occlusion. The latter always involves an occluding edge with progressive deletion on one side of a contour, but the former does not. I can think of three kinds of going out of sight not by occlusion: first, going into the distance by minification of the solid angle to a so-called vanishing point in the sky or on the horizon; second, going out of sight in "the dark"by reduc- tion of illumination; and third, going out of sight by closure or covering of the eyes. Perhaps going out of sight in fog or mist is another kind, but it is similar to loss of structure by darkness (Chapter 4). I can also think of three kinds of occlusion other than self-occlusion (Chapter 5): first, at the edge of an opaque covering surface; second, at the edge of the field of view of an observer: and third, for celestial bodies, at the horizon of the earth. As for the going out of existence of a surface, there seem to be many kinds of destruction, so many that only a list of examples could be given in Chapter 6 on ecological events.

Locomotion in a Cluttered Environment

The following seven statements about reversible occlusion are taken from Chapters 1 to 5.

1. The substances of the environment differ in the degree to which they persist, some resisting dissolution, disintegration, or vaporization more than others. 184 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

2. The surfaces of the environment, similarly, differ in the degree to which they persist, some being transitory and others being relatively permanent. A surface goes out of existence when its substance dissolves, disintegrates, or evaporates.

3. Given an illuminated medium, a surface is unhidden at a fixed point of observation if it has a visual solid angle in the ambient optic array at that point. If it does not (but has at another point of observation), it is hidden.

4. For any fixed point of observation, the persisting layout of the environ- ment is divided into hidden and unhidden surfaces. Conversely, for every persisting surface, the possible points of observation are divided into those at which it is hidden and those at which it is not.

5. A surface that has no visual solid angle at any point of observation is neither hidden nor unhidden. It is out of existence, not out of sight.

6. Any movement of a point of observation that hides previously unhidden surfaces has an opposite movement that reveals them. Thus, the hidden and the unhidden interchange. This is the law of reversible occlusion for locomotion in a cluttered habitat. It implies that after a sufficient sequence of reversible loco- motions all surfaces will have been both hidden and unhidden.

7. The loci of occlusion are those places at which the hidden and unhidden surfaces into which a layout is temporarily divided are separated at occluding edges, there being two sorts, apical and curved. They are also the places where the hidden and unhidden surfaces are joined at occluding edges. Thus, to perceive an occluding edge of an object, even a fixed occluding edge at a fixed point of observation, is to perceive both the separation and the junction of its far and near surfaces.

The Motions of Detached Objects

Three more statements about reversible occlusion follow; they are taken from Chapter 5.

8. For any opaque object, the near surface, the temporary "front,"hides the far surface, the temporary "back," at a fixed point of observation. The two interchange, however, when the object is rotated. The near surface also hides the background of the object, if present, but when the object is displaced the parts that go behind at one edge come from behind at the other. These facts can be observed in the film entitled The Change from Visible to Invisible: A Study of Optical Transitions (Gibson, 1968).

9. For both solidity and superposition, any motion of an object that conceals a surface has a reverse motion that reveals it.

10. To the extent that the objects of the environment have moved or been moved, the near and far sides of every object will have interchanged many times. This holds true over and above the extent to which the observer has moved around. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 185 Head Turning

Following is the theorem about reversible occlusion when the observer looks around by turning her head. It is now assumed that the point of observation is occupied (Chapter 7).

11. For any fixed posture of the head, surfaces of the surrounding layout are divided into those inside the boundaries of the field of view and those outside the boundaries of the field. But with every turn of the head surfaces come into sight at the leading edge of the field of view and go out of sight at the trailing edge. The observer who looks around can thus see undivided surround- ings and see herself in the middle of them.

Nonpersisting Surfaces

The next theorem is about the unreversing destruction and creation of surfaces and the unreversing optical transitions that accompany them (Chapter 6).

12. The going out of existence of a surface is not the reverse of its coming into existence, nor is the disturbance of optical structure that specifies one the reverse of the disturbance of structure that specifies the other. Hence, the disap- pearance of a surface by, say, dissolution can be distinguished from its disap- pearance by occlusion if the observer has learned to see the difference between the optical transitions. Such evidence as there is suggests that the two kinds of disappearance are usually distinguished (Gibson, Kaplan, Reynolds, and Wheeler, 1969). This is not to say that infants notice the difference, or even that adults always notice the difference. The difference may sometimes be hard to notice, as when a conjurer is playing tricks with one's perception. It is only to say that anyone can learn to see the difference.

The occlusion of a surface can be nullified, whereas the destruction of a surface cannot. Occlusion can be canceled by a movement of the body, head, or limbs in the opposite direction. Destruction, although it can sometimes be remedied, cannot simply be canceled by an opposite movement. It seems to me that young children must notice the optical transitions that can be thus nullified and those that cannot. How could they fail to pay attention to them? They play peek-a-boo, turn their heads, and watch their hands, all cases of reversible occlusion, and they also spill the milk, break the glass, and knock down the tower of blocks, things that cannot be reversed. But this hypothesis has not been tested with babies, because the only experiments carried out are in the spirit of rationalism promoted by J. Piaget, which asserts that children must form a concept of persistence or permanence and emphasizes what the children believe instead of what they see (for example, Bower, 1974, Ch. 7). 186 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

What is Seen at this Moment from this Position does not

Comprise What is Seen

The old approach to perception took the central problem to be how one could see into the distance and never asked how one could see into the past and the future. These were not problems for perception. The past was remembered, and the future was imagined. Perception was of the present. But this theory has never worked. No one could decide how long the present lasted, or what distin- guished memory from imagination, or when percepts began to be stored, or which got stored, or any other question to which this doctrine led. The new approach to perception, admitting the coperception of the self to equal status with the perception of the environment, suggests that the latter is timeless and that present-past-future distinctions are relevant only to the awareness of the self.

The environment seen-at-this-moment does not constitute the environ- ment that is seen. Neither does the environment seen-from-this-point consti- tute the environment that is seen. The seen-now and the seen-from-here specify the self, not the environment. Consider them separately.

What is seen now is a very restricted sample of the surfaces of the world, limited to those that are inside the boundaries of the field of view at this head- posture. It is even limited to that surface being fixated at this eye-posture, if by seen one means clearly seen. This is at most less than half of the world and perhaps only a detail of that.

What is seen from here is at most the optically uncovered surfaces of the world at this point of observation, that is, the near sides of objects, the unhidden portions of the ground, the walls, and the bits that project through windows and doors.

The fact is that, although one can become aware of the seen-now and the seen-from-here if one takes the attitude of introspection, what one perceives is an environment that surrounds one, that is everywhere equally clear, that is in-the-round or solid, and that is all-of-a-piece. This is the experience of what I once called the visual world (Gibson, 1950b, Ch. 3). It has vistas that are connected and places that adjoin, with a continuous ground beneath every- thing, below the clutter, receding into the distance, out to the horizon.

The surface being fixated now at this momentary eye-posture is not a depth- less patch of color, and the surfaces inside the field of view seen now at this head-posture are not a depthless patchwork of colors, for they have the quality that I called slant in the last chapter. The seen-at-this-moment is not the same. therefore, as the supposedly flat visual field analogous to the colors laid on a canvas by a painter that the old theory of color sensations asserted. I once believed that you could with training come to see the world as a picture, or almost do so, but I now have doubts about it. That comes close to saying that you can almost see your retinal image, which is a ridiculous assertion. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 187 FIGURE 11.1 The surfaces viewed now from here by an observer seated in a room. At this temporary eye posture and this temporary head posture, the surfaces projected into the retinal image are indicated by solid lines and the remaining surfaces by dashed lines. The awareness of the here-and-now surfaces might be called viewing the room as distinguished from seeing the room. This is a vertical section of the observer and his monocular field of view.

The seen-from-here, from this stationary point of observation, is also not the supposedly flat visual field of tradition, for it is ambient. But it might justly be called viewing the world in perspective, or noticing the perspectives of things. This means the natural perspective of ancient optics, not the artificial perspective of the Renaissance; it refers to the set of surfaces that create visual solid angles in a frozen ambient optic array. This is a very small sample of the whole world, however, and what we perceive is the world.

Perception Over Time from Paths of Observation

It is obvious that a motionless observer can see the world from a single fixed point of observation and can thus notice the perspectives of things. It is not so obvious but it is true that an observer who is moving about sees the world at no point of observation and thus, strictly speaking, cannot notice the perspectives of things. The implications are radical. Seeing the world at a traveling point of observation, over a long enough time for a sufficiently extended set of paths, 188 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

begins to be perceiving the world at all points of observation, as if one could be everywhere at once. To be everywhere at once with nothing hidden is to be all-seeing, like God. Each object is seen from all sides, and each place is seen as connected to its neighbor. The world is not viewed in perspective. The under- lying invariant structure has emerged from the changing perspective structure, as I put it in Chapter 5.

Animals and people do in fact see the environment during locomotion, not just in the pauses between movements. They probably see better when moving than when stationary. The arrested image is only necessary for a photographic camera. An observer who is getting around in the course of daily life sees from what I will call a path of observation. A path does not have to be treated as an infinite set of adjacent points at an infinite set of successive instants; it can be thought of as a unitary movement, an excursion, a trip, or a voyage. A path of observation is the normal case, short paths for short periods of observation and long paths for hours, days, and years of observation. The medium can be thought of as composed not so much of points as of paths.

It sounds very strange to say that one can perceive an object or a whole habitat at no fixed point of observation, for it contradicts the picture theory of perception and the retinal image doctrine on which it is based. But it has to be true if it is acknowledged that one can perceive the environment during locomotion. The perception of the environment is understood to accompany the visual proprio- ception of the locomotion, of course, and the hypothesis of invariant structure underlying the changing perspective structure is required for this to be intelli- gible. These are unfamiliar notions. But the notion of ambulatory vision is not more difficult, surely, than the notion of successive snapshots of the flowing optic array taken by the eye and shown in the dark projection room of the skull. The Problem of Orientation

Animals and humans are capable of being oriented to the habitat. This state is the opposite of being disoriented or "lost." The rat who can find its way directly to the goal box of a maze is said to be oriented to the goal. If there are many paths to the goal, the animal is capable of taking the shortest path. A person, similarly, can learn the way to work, to the post office, to the grocery store, and back home again through the passageways of his town. When he can do so in an unfa- miliar town, he has become oriented in the new habitat. Both animals and humans are capable of homing. More generally, they are capable of way-finding. Or, in still other terms, they can do place-learning. Observers can go to the places in their environment that have affordances for them. If they are human observers, moreover, they may be able to point to these places, that is, to indicate their direction from here through the walls or other surfaces that hide them.

Two current explanations of how animals learn to find their way to hidden places are the theory of response chains and the theory of cognitive maps. The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 189 Neither is adequate. Way-finding is surely not a sequence of turning responses conditioned to stimuli. But neither is it the consulting of an internal map of the maze, for who is the internal perceiver to look at the map? The theory of reversible occlusion can provide a better explanation.

An alley in a maze, a room in a house, a street in a town, and a valley in a countryside each constitutes a place, and a place often constitutes a vista(Gibson, 1966b, p. 206)，a semienclosure, a set of unhidden surfaces. A vista is what is seen from here, with the proviso that "here" is not a point but an extended region. Vistas are serially connected since at the end of an alley the next alley opens up; at the edge of the doorway the next room opens up; at the corner of the street the next street opens up; at the brow of the hill the next valley opens up. To go from one place to another involves the opening up of the vista ahead and closing in of the vista behind. A maze or a cluttered environment provides a choice of vistas. And thus, to find the way to a hidden place, one needs to see which vista has to be opened up next, or which occluding edge hides the goal. One vista leads to another in a continuous set of reversible transitions. Note that in a terrestrial environment of semienclosed places each vista is unique, unlike the featureless passageways of a maze. Each vista is thus its own "land- mark"inasmuch as the habitat never duplicates itself.

When the vistas have been put in order by exploratory locomotion, the invariant structure of the house, the town, or the whole habitat will be appre- hended. The hidden and the unhidden become one environment. One can then perceive the ground below the clutter out to the horizon, and at the same time perceive the clutter. One is oriented to the environment. It is not so much having a bird's-eye view of the terrain as it is being everywhere at once. The getting of a bird's-eye view is helpful in becoming oriented, and the explorer will look down from a high place if possible. Homing pigeons are better at orientation than we are. But orientation to goals behind the walls, beyond the trees, and over the hill is not just a looking-down-on, and it is certainly not the having of a map, not even a "cognitive"map supposed to exist in the mind instead of on paper. A map is a useful artifact when the hiker is lost, but it is a mistake to confuse the artifact with the psychological state the artifact promotes.

Note that the perception of places and the perception of detached objects are quite different. Places cannot be displaced, whereas objects can be, and animate objects displace themselves. Places merge into adjacent places, whereas objects have boundaries. Orientation to hidden places with their attached objects can be learned once and for all, whereas orientation to movable objects has to be relearned continually. I know where the kitchen sink is. I think I know where the ski boots are stored, but I don't always know where my child is. One can only go to the last known locus of a detached object. Hidden objects can be moved without that event being perceived, and the unhappy state of the man whose car keys are seldom where he left them is notorious. 190 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

FIGURE 11.2 The opening up of a vista at an occluding edge, as seen from above.

This is a plan view of a passageway that opens on a courtyard from which another passageway leads. As an observer moves along the corridor, the surfaces behind his head progressively go out of sight, and surfaces in front progessively come into sight at one occluding edge and then the other. The hidden portions of the ground are indicated by hatching. The hidden portions of the walls are indicated by dashed lines. The position of the observer is indicated by a black dot.

In the pages above I have formulated a theory of orientation to the places of the habitat. The perceiving of the world entails the coperceiving of where one is in the world and of being in the world at that place. This is a neglected fact that is neither subjective nor objective. To the extent that one has moved from place to place, from vista to vista, one can stand still in one place and see where one is, which means where one is relative to where one might be. One does not need a map with a circle on it labeled, "You are here." I suggest that this consti- tutes the state of being oriented.

The Problem of Public Knowledge

The hypothesis of reversible optical transformations and occlusions resolves the puzzle of how, although the perspective appearances of the world are different for different observers, they nevertheless perceive the same world. Perspective appearances are not the necessary basis of perception.

It is true that there is a different optic array for each point of observation and that different observers must occupy different points at any one time. But The Discovery of the Occluding Edge and its Implications for Perception 191 observers move, and the same path may be traveled by any observer. If a set of observers move around, the same invariants under optical transformations and occlusions will be available to all. To the extent that the invariants are detected, all observers will perceive the same world. Each will also be aware that his or her place in the world is different here and now from that of any other.

Points, of course, are geometrical concepts, whereas places are ecological layouts, but the above theory can also be put geometrically: although at a given instant some points of observation are occupied and the remainder unoccupied, the one set can go into the other.

The theory asserts that an observer can perceive the persisting layout from other places than the one occupied at rest. This means that the layout can be perceived from the position of another observer. The common assertion, then. that "I can put myself in your position" has meaning in ecological optics and is not a mere figure of speech. To adopt the point of view of another person is not an advanced achievement of conceptual thought. It means, I can perceive surfaces hidden at my point of view but unhidden at yours. This means, I can perceive a surface that is behind another. And if so, we can both perceive the same world.

The Puzzle of Egocentric Awareness

Psychologists often talk about egocentric perception. An egocentric perceiver is supposed to be one who can see the world only from his own point of view, and this habit is sometimes thought to characterize an egocentric person. Egoism is thought to come naturally to humans because they are innately aware of their private experiences and do not easily learn to adopt the point of view of others. This line of thinking now seems mistaken. Perception and proprioception are not alternatives or opposing tendencies of experience but complementary experiences.

The sensation-based theories of perception assume that the perspective appearances of the world are all that a newborn infant is given. They are the data for perception. Hence, the young child is necessarily egocentric, and cognitive development is a matter of progressing from subjective sensations to objective perceptions. The child's ego encompasses the world, and at the same time she is supposed to be confined to the awareness of her fleeting sensations. But there is a reason to be suspicious of all these speculations. The evidence about the earliest visual experiences of infants does not suggest that they are confined to surfaces seen-now-from-here, and the evidence definitely contradicts the doctrine that what they see is a flat patchwork of color sensations. I therefore suspect that the supposed egocentricity of the young child is a myth.

Hiding, Peeking, and Privacy

In Chapter 8 on affordances, I described how some of the places of an environ- ment are hiding places. That is, they afford the hiding of oneself or of one's 192 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

property from the sight of other observers. The phenomenon of seeing without being seen illustrates the application of optical occlusion to social psychology. The passage on hiding places in Chapter 8 should be reread.

The perceiving of occluded places and objects does occur and can be shared with other perceivers. To this extent, we all perceive the same world. But there is also ignorance of occluded things, and if you hide from me your private property, your hideaway in the hills, your secret lover, or the birthmark on your buttocks, then you and I do not perceive quite the same world. Public knowledge is possible, but so is its reciprocal, private knowledge.

Not only do babies like to play peek-a-boo and children to play hide-and- seek, but animals who are preyed upon hide from the predator, and the pred- ator may hide from the prey in ambush. One observer often wants to spy upon others, to see without being seen. He peers through a peephole or peeks around the occluding edge of a corner. In opposition to this is the striving not to be seen by others, the need for privacy. Burrows, caves, huts, and houses afford not only shelter from wind, cold, and rain but also the state of being out of sight, or out of the "public eye."

The human habit of covering the body with clothing whenever one is in sight of others is a matter of hiding some skin surfaces but not others, depending on the conventions of the culture. To display the usually covered surfaces is improper or immodest. The providing of some information for the layout of these hidden surfaces, however, is the aim of skillful clothing designers. And the careful manipulation of the occluding edges of clothing with progressive revealing of skin is a form of the theatrical art called stripping.

Summary

The demonstration that reversible occlusion is a fact of visual perception has far-reaching implications. It implies that an occluding edge is seen as such, that the persistence of a hidden surface is seen, and that the connection of the hidden with the unhidden is perceived. This awareness of what-is-behind, and of the togetherness of the far side and the near side of any object, puts many of the problems of psychology in a new light.

The doctrine that all awareness is memory except that of the present moment of time must be abandoned. So must the theory of depth perception. The importance of the fixed point of view in vision is reduced. But a new theory of orientation, of way-finding, and of place-learning in the environment becomes possible. And the puzzles of public knowledge, of egocentricity, and of privacy begin to be intelligible.
