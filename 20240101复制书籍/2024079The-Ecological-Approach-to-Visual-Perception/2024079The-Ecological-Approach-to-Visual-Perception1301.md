## 13. Locomotion and Manipulation

The theory of affordances implies that to see things is to see how to get about among them and what to do or not do with them. If this is true, visual percep- tion serves behavior, and behavior is controlled by perception. The observer who does not move but only stands and looks is not behaving at the moment, it is true, but he cannot help seeing the affordances for behavior in whatever he looks at.

Moving from place to place is supposed to be"physical"whereas perceiving is supposed to be "mental,"but this dichotomy is misleading. Locomotion is guided by visual perception. Not only does it depend on perception but percep- tion depends on locomotion inasmuch as a moving point of observation is necessary for any adequate acquaintance with the environment. So we must perceive in order to move, but we must also move in order to perceive.

Manipulation is another kind of behavior that depends on perception and also facilitates perception. Let us consider in this chapter how vision enters into these two kinds of behavior.

The Evolution of Locomotion and Manipulation

Support

Animals, no less than other bodies, are pulled downward by the force of gravity. They fall unless supported. In water the animal is supported by the medium, which has about the same density as its body. But in air the animal must have a substantial surface below if it is not to become a Newtonian falling body.

Locomotion has evolved from swimming in the sea to crawling and walking on land to clinging and climbing on the protuberances that clutter up the land 214 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

and, finally, to flying through the air, the most rapid kind of locomotion but the most risky. Fish are supported by the medium, terrestrial animals by a substan- tial surface on the underside, and birds (when they are not at rest) by airflow, the aerodynamic force called lift. Zoologists sometimes classify animals as aquatic, terrestrial, or aerial, having in mind the different ways of getting about in water, on land, or in the air.

Visual Perception of Support

A terrestrial animal must have a surface that pushes up on its feet, or its underside. The experiments reported in Chapter 4 with the glass floor appar- atus suggest that many terrestrial animals cannot maintain normal posture unless they can see their feet on the ground. With optical information to specify their feet off the ground, they act as if they were falling freely, crouching and showing signs of fear. But when a textured surface is brought up under the glass floor, the animals stand and walk normally (E. J. Gibson, 1969, pp.267-270).

This result implies that contact of the feet with the surface of support as against separation of the feet from the surface is specified optically, at the occluding edges of the feet. The animal who moves its head or uses two eyes can perceive either no separation in depth between its feet and the floor or the kind of separation it would see if it were suspended in air. Contact is specified both optically and mechanically

Note that a rigid surface of earth can be distinguished from a nonrigid surface of water by its color, texture, and the absence or presence of ripples. A surface of water does not afford support for chicks, but it does for ducklings. The latter take to the water immediately after hatching; the former do not.

Manipulation

Manipulation presumably evolved in primates, along with bipedal locomotion and the upright posture, by the conversion of the forelimbs from legs into arms and of the forepaws into what we call hands. Walking on two legs, it is some- times said, leaves the hands free for other acts. The hands are specified by "five- pronged squirming protrusions"into the field of view from below (Chapter 7). They belong to the self, but they are constantly touching the objects of the outer world by reaching and grasping. The shapes and sizes of objects, in fact, are perceived in relation to the hands, as graspable or not graspable, in terms of their affordances for manipulation. Infant primates learn to see objects and their hands in conjunction. The perception is constrained by manipulation, and the manipulation is constrained by perception. Locomotion and Manipulation 215

The Control of Locomotion and Manipulation

Locomotion and manipulation, like the movements of the eyes described in the last chapter, are kinds of behavior that cannot be reduced to responses. The persistent effort to do so by physiologists and psychologists has come to a dead end. But the ancient Cartesian doctrine still hangs on, that animals are reflex mahines and that humans are the same except for a soul that rules the body by switching impulses at the center of the brain. The doctrine will not do. Locomotion and manipulation are not triggered by stimuli from outside the body, nor are they initiated by commands from inside the brain. Even the clas- sification of incoming impulses in nerves as sensory and outgoing impulses as motor is based on the old doctrine of mental sensations and physical movements. Neurophysiologists, most of them, are still under the influence of dualism, however much they deny philosophizing. They still assume that the brain is the seat of the mind. To say, in modem parlance, that it is a computer with a program, either inherited or acquired, that plans a voluntary action and then commands the muscles to move is only a little better than Descartes's theory, for to say this is still to remain confined within the doctrine of responses.

Locomotion and manipulation are neither triggered nor commanded but controlled. They are constrained, guided, or steered, and only in this sense are they ruled or governed. And they are controlled not by the brain but by information, that is, by seeing oneself in the world. Control lies in the animal- environment system. Control is by the animal in its world, the animal itself having subsystems for perceiving the environment and concurrently for getting about in it and manipulating it. The rules that govern behavior are not like laws enforced by an authority or decisions made by a commander; behavior is regular without being regulated. The question is how this can be.

WHAT HAPPENS TO INFANT PRIMATES DEPRIVED OF

THE SIGHT OF THEIR HANDS?

Monkeys reared from birth in a device that kept them from seeing the hands

and body but not from feeling them move and touching things were very

abnormal monkeys. When freed from the device, they acted at first as if they

could not reach for and grasp an object but must grope for it. An opaque

shield with a cloth bib fitted tightly around the monkey's neck had elimin-

ated visual kinesthesis and had thus prevented the development of visual

control of reaching and grasping. So I interpret the results of an experiment

by R. Held and J. A. Bauer (1974). See my discussion of the optical informa-

tion for hand movement in Chapter 7. 216 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The medium Contains the Information for Control

It should be kept in mind that animals live in a medium that, being insubstan- tial, permits them to move about, if supported. We are tempted to call the medium"space,"but the temptation should be resisted. For the medium, unlike space, permits a steady state of reverberating illumination to become estab- lished such that it contains information about surfaces and their substances. That is, there is an array at every point of observation and a changing array at every moving point of observation. The medium, as distinguished from space, allows compression waves from a mechanical event, sound, to reach all points of observation and also allows the diffusion field from a volatile substance, odor, to reach them (Gibson, 1966b, Ch. 1). The odor is specific to the volatile substance, the sound is specific to the event, and the visual solid angle is the most specific of all, containing all sorts of structured invariants for perceiving the affordance of the object. This is why to perceive something is also to perceive how to approach it and what to do about it.

Information in a medium is not propagated as signals are propagated but is contained. Wherever one goes, one can see, hear, and smell. Hence, perception in the medium accompanies locomotion in the medium.

Visual Kinesthesis and Control

Before getting into the problem of control, we should be clear about the differ- ence between active and passive movement, a difference that is especially important in the case of locomotion. For animal locomotion may be uncon- trolled; the animal may be simply transported. This can happen in various ways. A flow of the medium can transport the animal, as happens to the bird in a wind and the fish in a stream. Or an individual may be transported by another animal, as happens to a monkey clinging to its mother or a baby carried in a cradleboard. Or the observer may be a passenger in a vehicle. In all these cases, the animal can see its locomotion without initiating, governing, or steering it. The animal has the information for transportation but cannot regulate it. In my terminology, the observer has visual kinesthesis but no visual control of the movement. This distinction is essential to an understanding of the problem of control. The traditional theory of the senses is incapable of making it, however, and followers of the traditional theory become mired in the conceptual confu- sion arising from the slippery notion of feedback.

Visual kinesthesis specifies locomotion relative to the environment, whereas the other kinds of kinesthesis may or may not do so. The control oflocomotion in the environment must therefore be visual. Walking, bicycling, and driving involve very different kinds of classical kinesthesis but the same visual kines- thesis. The muscle movements must be governed by vision. If you want to go somewhere, or to know where you are going, you can only trust your eyes. The Locomotion and Manipulation 217

bird in a wind even has to fly in order to stay in the same place. To prevent

being carried away, it must arrest the flow of the ambient array.

Before we can hope to understand controlled locomotion, therefore, we

must answer several preliminary questions about the information in ambient

light. I can think of four. What specifies locomotion or stasis? What specifies

an obstacle or an opening? What specifies imminent contact with a surface?

What specifies the benefit or the injury that lies ahead? These questions must

be answered before we can begin to ask what the rules are for starting and stop-

ping, for approaching and retreating, for going this way or that way, and so on.

The Optical Information Necessary for Control of Locomotion

For each of the four questions above, I shall list a number of assertions about

optical information. I will try to put together what the previous chapters have

established.

What Specifies Locomotion or Stasis?

1. Flow of the ambient array specifies locomotion, and nonflow specifies stasis. By

flow is meant the change analyzed as motion perspective (Gibson, Olum, and

Rosenblatt, 1955)for the abstract case of an uncluttered environment and a

moving point of observation. A better term would be flow perspective, or streaming

perspective. It yields the"melon-shaped family of curves"illustrated in Figure 13.1

and is based on rays of light from particles of the terrain, not on solid angles from

features of the terrain. Thus, it has the great advantages of geometrical analysis

but also has its disadvantages. Nevertheless, the flow as such specifies locomotion

and the invariants specify the layout of surfaces in which locomotion occurs.

2. Outflow specifies approach to and inflow specifies retreat from. An invariant

feature of the ambient flow is that one hemisphere is centrifugal and the other

centripetal. Outflow entails magnification, and inflow entails minification.

There is always both a going-to and a coming-from during locomotion. A

creature with semipanoramic vision can register both the outflow and the

inflow at the same time, but human creatures can sample only one or the other,

by looking "ahead" or by looking "behind."Note that a reversal of the flow

pattern specifies a reversal of locomotion.

3. The focus or center of outflow specifies the direction of locomotion in the environ-

ment. More exactly, that visual solid angle at the center of outflow specifies the

surface in the environment, or the object, or the opening, toward which the

animal is moving. This statement is not analytical. Because the overall flow is

radial in both hemispheres, the two foci are implicit in any sufficiently large

sample of the ambient array, and even humans can thus see where they are going

without having to look where they are going. The "melon-shaped family of

curves"continues outside the edges of the temporary field of view. 218 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

The vectors are plotted in angular coordinates, and all vectors vanish at the horizon. This drawing should be compared with Figure 7.3 showing the motion perspective to a flying bird. (From Gibson, Olum, and Rosenblatt, 1955. C 1955 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Reprinted by permission of the University of Illinois Press.)

4. A shift of the center of outflow from one visual solid angle to another specifies a change in the direction of locomotion, a turn, and a remaining of the center within the same solid angle specifies no change in direction. The ambient optic array is here supposed to consist of nested solid angles, not of a bundle of lines. The direc- tion of locomotion is thus anchored to the layout, not to a coordinate system. The flow of the ambient array can be transposed over the invariant structure of the array, so that where one is going is seen relative to the surrounding layout. This unfamiliar notion of invariant structure underlying the changing perspective structure is one that I tried to make explicit in Chapter 5; here is a good example of it. The illustrations in Chapter 7 showing arrows superposed on a picture of Locomotion and Manipulation 219

the terrain were supposed to suggest this invariance under change but, of course, it cannot be pictured.

5. Flow of the textured ambient array just behind certain occluding protrusions into the field of view specifies locomotion by an animal with feet. If you lower your head while walking, a pair of moving protrusions enters the field of view from its lower edge (Chapter 7), and these protrusions move up and down alternately. A cat sees the same thing except that what it sees are front feet. The extremities are in optical contact with the flowing array at the locus of maximal flow and maximally coarse texture. They occlude parts of the surface, but it is seen to extend behind them. Convexities and concavities in the surface will affect the timing of contact, and therefore you and the cat must place your feet with regard to the footing.

What Specifies an Obstacle or an Opening?

I distinguish two general cases for the affording of locomotion, which I will call obstacle and opening. An obstacle is a rigid object, detached or attached, a surface with occluding edges. An opening is an aperture, hole, or gap in a surface, also with occluding edges. An obstacle affords collision. An opening affords passage. Both have a closed or nearly closed contour in the optic array, but the edge of the obstacle is inside the contour, whereas the edge of the opening is outside the contour. A round object hides in one direction, and a round opening hides in the opposite direction. The way to tell the difference between an obstacle and an opening, therefore, is as follows.

ON LOOKING AT THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING

It must be admitted that when I turn around while driving our car and reply

to my wife's protests that I can perfectly well see where I am going without

having to look where I am going because the focus of outflow is implicit, she

is not reassured.

6. Loss (or gain) of structure outside a closed contour during approach (or retreat) specifies an obstacle. Gain (or loss) of structure inside a closed contour during approach or retreat) specifies an opening. This is the only absolutely trustworthy way to tell the difference between an obstacle and an opening. In both cases the visual solid angle goes to a hemisphere as you approach it, but you collide with the obstacle and enter the opening. Magnification of the form as such, the outline, does not distinguish them. But as you come up to the obstacle it hides more and more of the vista, and as you come up to the opening it reveals more and more of the vista. Deletion outside the occluding edge and accretion inside the occluding 220 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

edge will distinguish the two. Psychologists and artists alike have been confused about the difference between things and holes, surfaces and apertures. The figure-ground phenomenon that so impressed the gestalt psychologists and that is still taken to be a prototype of perception is misleading. A closed contour as such in the optic array does not specify an object in the environment.

What specifies the near edge of an opening in the ground, a hole or gap in the surface of support? This is very important information for a terrestrial animal.

7. Gain of structure above a horizontal contour in the ambient array during approach specifies a brink in the surface of support. A brink is a drop-off in the ground, a step, or the edge of a perch. It is the essential feature of the experiments on the visual cliff that were described in Chapter 9(for example, E. J. Gibson and Walk, 1960). It is depth downward at an occluding edge, and depending on the amount of depth relative to the size of the animal, it affords stepping-down or falling-off. The rat, chick, or human infant who sees its feet close to such an occluding edge needs to take care. The experimental evidence suggests that the changing occlusion at the edge, not the abrupt increase in the density of optical texture, is the effective information for the animal.

This formula applies to a horizontal contour in the array coming from the ground. What about a vertical contour in the array coming from a wall?

8. Gain of structure on one side of a vertical contour in the ambient array during approach specifies the occluding edge of a barrier, and the side on which gain occurs is the side of the edge that affords passage. This is the edge of a house, the end of a wall, or the vertical edge of a doorway, often loosely called a corner. On one side of the edge the vista beyond is hidden, and on the other side it is revealed; on one side there is potential collision, and on the other potential passage. The trunk of a tree has two such curved edges not far apart. To "go around the corner"is to reveal the surfaces of the new vista. Rats do it in mazes, and people do it in cities. To find one's way in a cluttered environment is to go around a series of occluding edges, and the problem is to choose the correct edges to go around (see Figure 11.2).

What Specifies Imminent Contact with a Surface?

In an early essay on the visual control of locomotion (Gibson, 1958)，I wrote:

Approach to a solid surface is specified by a centrifugal flow of the texture

of the optic array. Approach to an object is specified by a magnification

of the closed contour in the array corresponding to the edges of the

object. A uniform rate of approach is accompanied by an accelerated rate of

magnification. At the theoretical point where the eye touches the object,

the latter will intercept a visual angle of 180°. The magnification reaches

an explosive rate in the last moments before contact. This accelerated

expansion... specifies imminent collision. Locomotion and Manipulation 221

This was true enough as far as it went. I was thinking of the problem of how a pilot lands on a field or how a bee lands on a flower. The explosive magnific- ation, the "looming" as I called it, has to be canceled if a"soft"landing is to be achieved. I never thought of the entirely different problem of steering through an opening. The optical information provided by various kinds of magnifica- tion is evidently not as simple as I thought in 1958.

The complexities were not clarified by the empirical studies of Schiff, Caviness, and Gibson (1962) and Schiff (1965)，who provided the optical information for the approach of an object in space instead of the information for approach to a surface in the environment. They displayed an expanding dark silhouette in the center of a luminous translucent screen, as described in Chapter 10. No one saw himself being transposed; everyone saw something indefinite coming toward them, as if it were in the sky. The display consisted of an expanding single form, a shadow or silhouette, not the magnifying of a nested structure of subordinate forms that characterizes approach to a real surface. The magnifying of detail without limit was missing from the display.

9. The magnification of a nested structure in which progressively finer details keep emerging at the center specifies approach of an observer to a surface in the environment. This formula emphasizes the facets within the faces of a substantial surface, such as that of an obstacle, an object, an animate object, or a surface of rest that the observer might encounter. In order to achieve contact without collision. the nested magnification must be made to cease at the appropriate level instead of continuing to its limit. There seems to be an optimal degree of magnifica- tion for contact with a surface, depending on what it affords. For food one moves up to eating distance; for manipulating one moves up to reaching distance; for print one moves up to reading distance.

What Specifies the Benefit or Injury that Lies Ahead?

Bishop Berkeley suggested in 1709 that the chief end of vision was for animals "to foresee the benefit or injury which is like to ensue upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance." What the philo- sopher called foresight is what I call the perception of the affordance. To see at a distance what the object affords on contact is "necessary for the preservation of an animal."

I differ from Bishop Berkeley in assuming that information is available in the light to the animal for what an encounter with the object affords. But I agree with him about the utility of vision.

10. Affordances for the individual upon encountering an object are specified in the optic array from the object by invariants and invariant combinations. Tools, food, shelter, mates, and amiable animals are distinguished from poisons, fires, weapons, and hostile animals by their shapes, colors, textures, and deformations. The positive and negative affordances of things in the environment are what makes locomotion through 222 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

the medium such a fundamental kind of behavior for animals. Unlike a plant, the animal can go to the beneficial and stay away from the injurious. But it must be able to perceive the affordances from afar. A rule for the visual control of locomotion might be this: so move as to obtain beneficial encounters with objects and places and to prevent injurious encounters.

Rules for the Visual Control of Locomotion

I suggested at the beginning that behavior was controlled by information about the world and the self conjointly. The information has now been described. What about the control?

I asserted that behavior was controlled by rules. Surely, however, they are not rules enforced by an authority. The rules are not commands from a brain; they emerge from the animal-environment system. But the only way to describe rules is in words, and a rule expressed in words is a command. I am faced with a paradox. The rules for the control of locomotion will sound like commands, although they are not intended to. I can only suggest that the reader should interpret them as rules not formulated in words.

The rules that follow are for visual control, not muscular, articular, vestibular. or cutaneous control. The visual system normally supersedes the haptic system for locomotion and manipulation, as I tried to explain in The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966b). This means that the rules for locomotion will be the same for crawling on all fours, walking, running, or driving an automobile. The particular muscles involved do not matter. Any group of muscles will suffice if it brings about the relation of the animal to its environ- ment stated in the rule.

Standing. The basic rule for a pedestrian animal is stand up; that is, keep the feet in contact with a surface of support. It is also well to keep the oval bound- aries of the field of view normal with the implicit horizon of the ambient array; if the head is upright the rest of the body follows.

Starting, stopping, going back. To start, make the array flow. To stop, cancel the flow. To go back, make the flow reverse. According to the first two formulas listed in the previous pages, to cause outflow is to get closer and to cause inflow is to get farther away.

Steering. To turn, shift the center of outflow from one patch in the optic array to another, according to thethe third and fourth formulas. Steering requires that openings be distinguished from barriers, obstacles, and brinks. The rule is: To steer, keep the center of outflow outside the patches of the array that specify barriers, obstacles, and brinks and within a patch that specifies an opening (sixth, seventh, and eighth formulas). Following this rule will avert collisions and prevent falling off.

Approaching. To approach is to magnify a patch in the array, but magnification is complicated (formulas two and six). There are many rules involving magni- fication. Here are a few. To permit scrutiny, magnify the patch in the array to such a Locomotion and Manipulation 223

degree that the details can be looked at. To manipulate something graspable, magnify the patch to such a degree that the object is within reach. To bite something, magnify the patch to such an angle that the mouth can grasp it. To kiss someone, magnify the face-form, if the facial expression is amiable, so as almost to fill the field of view. (It is absolutely essential for one to keep one's eyes open so as to avoid collision. It is also wise to learn to discriminate those subtle invariants that specify amiability.) To read something, magnify the patch to such a degree that the letters become distinguishable. The most general rule for approach is this: To realize the positive affordances of something, magnify its optical structure to that degree necessary for the behavioral encounter.

Entering enclosures. An enclosure such as a burrow, cave, nest, or hut affords various benefits upon entry. It is a place of warmth, a shelter from rain and wind, and a place for sleep. It is often a home, the place where mate and offspring are. It is also a place of safety, a hiding place affording both conceal- ment from enemies and a barrier to their locomotion. An enclosure must have an opening to permit entry, and the opening must be identified. The rule seems to be as follows: to enter an enclosure, magnify the angle of its opening to 180° and open up the vista. Make sure that there is gain of structure inside the contour and not loss outside, or else you will collide with an obstacle (formulas six and nine).

Keeping a safe distance. The opposite of approach is retreat. Psychologists have sometimes assumed that the alternative to approach is retreat. Kurt Lewin's theory of behavior, for example, was based on approach to an object with a positive "valence" and retreat from an object with a negative "valence." This fits with a theory of conflict between approach and retreat, and a compromise between opposite tendencies. But it is wrong to assume that approach and retreat are alternatives. There is no need to flee from an obstacle, a barbed-wire fence, the edge of a river, the edge of a cliff, or a fire. The only need is to maintain a safe distance, a "margin of safety,"since these things do not pursue the observer. A ferocious tiger has a negative valence, but a cliff does not. The rule is this, I think: To prevent an injurious encounter, keep the optical structure of the surface from magnifying to the degree that specifies an encounter (formulas two and ten).

For moving predators and enemies, flight is an appropriate form of action since they can approach. The rule for flight is, so move as to minify the dangerous form and to make the surrounding optic array flow inward. If, despite flight, the form magnifies, the enemy is catching up; if it minifies, one is getting away. At the predator's point of observation, of course, the rule is opposite to that for the prey: so move as to magnify the succulent form by making the surrounding array flow outward until it reaches the proper angular size for capturing.

Rules for the Visual Control of Manipulation

The rules for the visual control of the movements of the hands are more complex than those for the control of locomotion. But the human infant who 224 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

watches these squirming protuberances into his field of view is not formulating rules and, in any case, complexity does not seem to cause trouble for the nervous system. I am unable to formulate the rules in words except for a few easy cases.

Locomotor approach often terminates in reaching and grasping. Reaching is an elongation of the arm-shape and a minification of the five-pronged hand- shape until contact occurs. If the object is hand-size, it is graspable; if too large or too small, it is not. Children learn to see sizes in terms of prehension: they see the span of their grasp and the diameter of a ball at the same time (Gibson, 1966b, fig. 7.1，p. 119). Long before the child can discriminate one inch, or two, or three, he can see the fit of the object to the pincerlike action of the opposable thumb. The child learns his scale of sizes as commensurate with his body, not with a measuring stick.

The affordance of an elongated object for pounding and striking is easily learned. The skill of hammering or striking a target requires visual control, however. It involves what we vaguely call aiming. I will not try to state the rules for aiming except to suggest that it entails a kind of centering or symmetrical- izing of a diminishing form on a fixed form.

Throwing as such is easy. Simply cause the visual angle of the object you have in your hand to shrink, and it will"zoom"in a highly interesting manner. You have to let go, of course, and this is a matter of haptic control, not visual control. Aimed throwing is much harder, as ballplayers know. It is a sort of reciprocal of steered locomotion.

Tool-using in general is rule governed. The rule for pliers is analogous to that for prehending, the tool being metaphorically an extension of the hand. The use of a stick as a rake for getting a banana outside the cage was one of the achievements of a famous chimpanzee (Köhler, 1925).

Knives, axes, and pointed objects afford the cutting and piercing of other objects and surfaces, including other animals. But the manipulation must be carefully controlled, for the observer's own skin can be cut or pierced as well as the other surface. The tool must be grasped by the handle, not the point; that is, the rule for reaching and the rules for maintaining the margin of safety must both be followed. Visual contact with one part of the surface is beneficial but with another part is injurious, and the "sharp"part is not always easy to discrim- inate. The case is similar to that of walking along a cliff edge in this respect: one must steer the movement so as to skirt the danger.

The uses of the hands are almost unlimited. And manipulation subserves many other forms of behavior of which it is only a part, eating, drinking, trans- porting, nursing, caressing, gesturing, and the acts of trace-making, depicting, and writing, which will concern us in Part IV.

The point to remember is that the visual control of the hands is inseparably connected with the visual perception of objects. The act of throwing comple- ments the perception of a throwable object. The transporting of things is part and parcel of seeing them as portable or not. Locomotion and Manipulation 225

Conclusion about manipulation. One thing should be evident. The movements

of the hands do not consist of responses to stimuli. Manipulation cannot be

understood in those terms. Is the only alternative to think of the hands as

instruments of the mind? Piaget, for example, sometimes seems to imply that

the hands are tools of a child's intelligence. But this is like saying that the hand

is a tool of an inner child in more or less the same way that an object is a tool

for a child with hands. This is surely an error. The alternative is not a return to

mentalism. We should think of the hands as neither triggered nor commanded

but controlled.

Manipulation and the Perceiving of Interior Surfaces

Finally, it should be noted that a great deal of manipulation occurs for the sake of

perceiving hidden surfaces. I can think of three kinds of such manipulation:

opening up, uncovering, and taking apart. Each of these has an opposite, as one would

expect from the law of reversible occlusion: closing, covering, and putting together.

Opening and closing apply to the lids and covers of hollow objects and also to

drawers, compartments, cabinets, and other enclosures. Children are fascinated

by the act of opening so as to reveal the interior and closing so as to conceal it.

They then come to perceive the continuity between the inner and the outer

surfaces. The closed box and the covered pot are then seen to have an inside as

well as an outside.

Covering and uncovering apply to a cloth, or a child's blanket, or to revealing

and concealing by an opaque substance, as in a sandbox. The movement of the

hand that conceals the object is not always so clearly the reverse of the move-

ment that reveals it as it is in the case of closing-opening, however. The

perceiving of hidden surfaces may well be more difficult in this case.

Taking apart and putting together apply to an object composed of smaller objects, that is, a composite that can be disassembled and assembled. There are toys of this

sort. Blocks that can be fitted together make such a composite object. Taking apart

is usually a simpler act of manipulation than putting together. Children need to see

what is inside these compound objects, and it is only to be expected that they

should take them apart, or break them apart if need be. After such visual-manual

cooperation, they can perceive the interior surfaces of the object together with the

cracks, joins, and apertures that separate them. This is the way children come to apprehend a mechanism such as a clock or an internal combustion engine.

Summary

Active locomotor behavior, as contrasted with passive transportation, is under

the continuous control of the observer. The dominant level of such control is

visual. But this could not occur without what I have called visual kinesthesis, the

awareness of movement or stasis, of starting or stopping, of approaching or 226 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

retreating, of going in one direction or another, and of the imminence of an encounter. Such awarenesses are necessary for control.

Also necessary is an awareness of the affordance of the encounter that will terminate the locomotor act and of the affordances of the openings and obstacles, the brinks and barriers, and the corners on the way (actually the occluding edges).

When locomotion is thus visually controlled, it is regular without being a chain of responses and is purposive without being commanded from within.

Manipulation, like active locomotion, is visually controlled. It is thus dependent on an awareness of both the hands as such and the affordances for handling. But its regularities are not so easy to formulate.
