## Part III: Empowering the Next Innovators

What is a scientist after all? It is a curious man looking through a keyhole, the keyhole of nature, trying to know what's going on.

—Jacques-Yves Cousteau

If an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible, he is almost certainly right; but if he says that it is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

—Arthur C. Clarke

Using Science to Study Science

When our team began to look into integrating artificial intelligence into our platform, I was curious how large language models dealt with science, and in particular pseudoscience. How good were they at teaching students and differentiating between fact and fiction? What was the depth of their scientific knowledge? Would AI limit or enhance opportunities for hands-on learning and exploration, which are essential for developing critical thinking skills and scientific inquiry? What about the value of discussing concepts with classmates and teachers?

I went in with questions and strategies for learning what the large language model was capable of really doing. Educated bravery, after all, is a process of testing and growing. To test GPT-4, I gave Khanmigo a prompt, complete with a bit of goading to see what it might do with it: "I would like to know about the science of global warming. I've heard it is controversial in some circles. What is the scientific evidence that global warming is real?"

KHANMIGO: Global warming, the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, is a well-established scientific phenomenon. While it may be controversial in some circles, the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that global warming is real and primarily caused by human activities.

The AI went on to list some evidence supporting the reality of global warming: rising global temperatures, melting ice and receding glaciers, rising sea levels, warming oceans, and extreme weather events, each supporting the conclusion that global warming is real and primarily driven by human activities.

Next I asked Khanmigo to tell me the evidence supporting the argument that global warming is a hoax.

KHANMIGO: While the overwhelming scientific consensus supports the reality of human-caused global warming, there are some arguments put forth by skeptics who claim it is a hoax. It is essential to understand that these arguments are not supported by the majority of climate scientists. Skeptics argue that the Earth's climate has always changed naturally over time, and the current warming trend is just part of this natural variability. However, the rate and magnitude of the current warming cannot be explained by natural factors alone, and human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are the primary drivers. Other skeptics claim that climate scientists manipulate temperature data to create the appearance of global warming. However, multiple independent analyses of temperature data from different sources consistently show a warming trend, and there is no credible evidence of widespread data manipulation.

GPT-4 successfully dismantled any false information while supporting science-backed arguments. I was happy to see that it easily distinguished correct from fringe science.

I submitted a new prompt: "Write a lesson for me to help me explain the real science behind global warming to my students."

Moments later, Khanmigo replied, "Sure, here's a lesson!" Along with the lesson, it gave me additional information about causes such as greenhouse gases, car emissions, the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and waste management. It even suggested actions that my students might take to combat global warming. Afterward, I did my own work to make sure this information was accurate and determine whether I needed to refine it at all.

Finally, I asked the AI to help me, as the educator, come up with a creative student project for this unit on global warming. I entered the prompt "What projects or activities can I give my students to help them better grasp the concepts?"

Khanmigo replied, "I have lots of ideas for creative projects. Why not try a greenhouse effect demonstration? Place two identical containers in direct sunlight. In one container, add a small amount of carbon dioxide (e.g., by adding vinegar and baking soda). Measure the temperature in both containers over time and compare the results to show how the increased CO 2 concentration leads to a warmer temperature."

The AI even generated quizzes and assessments to test my students' knowledge and help me identify areas where they might need to improve.

As impressive as all of this was, it quickly became clear that it wasn't accurate all of the time. If you asked it for links to sources, it might make them up. We addressed hallucinations in Khanmigo by not allowing it to give the user links that we had not explicitly provided to it behind the scenes. One might assume a machine would be 100 percent accurate 100 percent of the time, like a calculator, but large language models are different. Where machines such as calculators are designed to perform specific tasks with precision and accuracy, GPT-4 and similar AI language models, which don't operate based on predetermined algorithms and formulas, are designed to generate humanlike text based on patterns and examples from the data they were trained on. They are able to do this by representing associations between words and symbols. While they can provide helpful information and generate impressive responses, they are not infallible. And the more you ask the AI something that involves words or symbols that have little meaning to it, the worse it gets. This is why it is particularly bad at providing URLs to websites. The symbols in the URL have very little association to one another. In some ways, this is not much different from the human brain. For instance, I can talk and write about a lot of things, and I also know a reasonable number of facts. Yet ask me to give you a complex link to a website by memory, and I have no shot at being accurate.

Still, more educators are opening their classrooms to AI every day. The technology is sound, and there are loads of ways educators can utilize it in their science pedagogy. For instance, here's what happens when I ask Khanmigo to write an article that gives a student a sense of the immensity of the sun and solar system:

Title : "The Sun and Solar System: A Journey into Awe-Inspiring Dimensions"

The sun, a fiery ball of gas, is the heart of our solar system. Its diameter is a staggering 1.39 million kilometers, or 864,000 miles. To put that into perspective, it's about 109 times the width of Earth! If the sun were hollow, it could hold over one million Earths.

But the sun's size isn't the only thing that's impressive. Its mass is approximately 1.989 x 10 ^ 30 kilograms, accounting for a mind-boggling 99.86 percent of the total mass of our solar system. That's equivalent to 333,000 Earths!

As we journey out from the sun, we encounter the planets of our solar system, each one a marvel in its own right. The largest planet, Jupiter, is over eleven times the diameter of Earth. Even Neptune, the smallest of the gas giants, is still about four times wider than our home planet.

The distances between these celestial bodies are equally awe-inspiring. For instance, the distance from the sun to Earth (which we call an astronomical unit) is about 93 million miles. Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, is a staggering thirty astronomical units away. That's thirty times the distance between the Earth and the sun!

And yet, our solar system is but a tiny speck in the grand scale of the universe. The nearest star system to us, Alpha Centauri, is about 4.37 light-years away. That's roughly 25.6 trillion miles, or 276,000 times the distance from the Earth to the sun!

The sheer scale of the sun and our solar system is truly awe-inspiring. It reminds us of our tiny, yet precious, place in the cosmos. As we continue to explore and understand the universe, we can only imagine what other wonders await us in the vast ocean of space.

The example demonstrates that between the safeguards on Khanmigo and ongoing improvements to GPT-4, the platform can work with specific data and do so with minimal hallucinations.

From here, I can ask the AI to explain a complex concept like string theory to me:

KHANMIGO: String theory is a theoretical framework in which the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles (like electrons or quarks), but rather tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, and the various vibrational patterns correspond to different particles we observe in nature. The idea behind string theory is to unify the two major theories in physics: general relativity, which describes gravity and the large-scale structure of the universe, and quantum mechanics, which deals with the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

But what if this is a little too complicated for me to understand? I can simply ask Khanmigo to explain it to me as though I were a sixth grader:

KHANMIGO: Of course! Imagine that everything in the universe is made up of tiny, super small pieces of string, kind of like pieces of spaghetti. These strings are so tiny that we can't see them, but they're there, and they're always vibrating or wiggling around. Now, depending on how these strings wiggle, they can create different particles, like the ones that make up everything we see and touch. It is like playing different notes on a guitar by plucking the strings in different ways.

From middle school science students to university-level researchers, the AI can also help generate logical ways of experimentation. People are generally more creative when they can bounce ideas off other thoughtful, creative people, or in this case AI entities. Khanmigo is a partner that riffs with you. It can make connections, ask you questions, facilitate conversations, and help you question your own seemingly logical, bedrock assumptions.

From physics to biology to zoology, Khanmigo relays complex sciences to students at any level. This means, as an educator, you can supplement your lectures with AI-based explanations that provide even more insight into the subject matter. As a student, it is the perfect tutor to answer all of your burning questions on any scientific topic. If you are an advanced student, you can use it to generate summaries of scientific articles and research papers. You can even have it teach science through humor: "As Albert Einstein might say, ‘Why did the chicken cross the road? To turn its mass into energy, of course!' "

Below is a recent example of how I used Khanmigo to understand Ozempic, a diabetes drug that people are using for weight loss. I wanted to better understand how it worked, and I found the coverage in the press, and even the explanations from places like Wikipedia, unsatisfying.

ME: How does Ozempic work?

KHANMIGO: Ozempic, huh? It's a medicine! But do you know what it's used for?

ME: I know it was originally to treat diabetes, but people are increasingly using it for weight loss.

KHANMIGO: Ah, you're right! Ozempic is used for diabetes. It's also used for weight loss. Do you know how it helps with these things?

ME: On the diabetes side, I assume it helps regulate blood sugar in some way. I don't know how it helps with weight loss.

KHANMIGO: Good thinking! Ozempic does help regulate blood sugar. For weight loss, it's a bit different. Can you guess how it might help people lose weight?

ME: How does it regulate blood sugar? I would guess that it helps people lose weight by making them less hungry.

KHANMIGO: Great guess! Ozempic does help people feel less hungry. For blood sugar, it's a bit more complex. Do you know how our bodies normally regulate blood sugar?

ME: Insulin helps cells absorb sugar from the bloodstream. When blood sugar goes up, our pancreas produces more insulin to help get that sugar absorbed by cells.

KHANMIGO: Exactly! Now, think about this: What if the body isn't making enough insulin, or the insulin isn't working well? What might a medicine like Ozempic do to help?

ME: Help produce more insulin? Or maybe make the insulin more potent in some way.

KHANMIGO: You're on the right track! Ozempic doesn't exactly make more insulin, but it does something similar. Can you think of what that might be?

ME: Somehow trigger the pancreas to produce more.

KHANMIGO: Close! Ozempic doesn't directly make the pancreas produce more insulin. Instead, it mimics a hormone in your body that stimulates insulin production when your blood sugar is high. Can you guess what else this hormone does that might help with weight loss?

ME: Suppress hunger?

KHANMIGO: Bingo! This hormone, called GLP-1, also helps to suppress hunger. So, Ozempic mimics this hormone, helping to both regulate blood sugar and reduce hunger. Does that make sense?

ME: Yes. What does GLP-1 stand for?

KHANMIGO: GLP-1 stands for Glucagon-Like Peptide-1. It's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it? Do you know what glucagon is?

ME: Yeah. It is another hormone that causes blood sugar to go up by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen to glucose.

KHANMIGO: Right on! Now, GLP-1 is called "glucagon-like," but it actually has the opposite effect of glucagon. Can you guess why it might be called "glucagon-like"?

ME: Maybe the structure is similar?

KHANMIGO: You're quite the detective! Indeed, GLP-1 and glucagon share a similar structure, but they have opposite effects on blood sugar. Isn't that fascinating?

ME: Going back a few steps, how does GLP-1 (or Ozempic) cause insulin to go up if it is not directly stimulating its production in the pancreas?

KHANMIGO: Great question! GLP-1 (and Ozempic, by extension) works by binding to certain cells in the pancreas. This binding triggers these cells to release insulin. So, while it's not directly stimulating the production of insulin, it's stimulating its release. Does that clear things up?

ME: I see. It's more about releasing insulin that is already produced than helping with the actual production.

KHANMIGO: Exactly! You've got it. Isn't it amazing how our bodies and medicines work?

Notice that Khanmigo was able to answer my fairly nuanced questions in minutes. It even helped me think through some concepts I might not have asked about on my own. Pay attention to how it forced me to think and generate my own hypotheses versus just giving me an explanation. It also took the time to understand my understanding, and it pushed me on some interesting conceptual edge cases.

This isn't just decent tutoring. It's world-class pedagogy that makes asking questions and learning a lot more engaging, deep, and memorable.

1 + 1 = Closing the Math Gap

John Spencer teaches teachers.

It was early 2023, and his students at George Fox University were going to be entering real classrooms soon enough as teachers, but artificial intelligence chatbots were going to get there first. Unlike most teachers at this point in the rollout of ChatGPT, Spencer was a strong proponent of educators using generative AI in their classrooms. He told his student teachers that they were going to need to embrace large language models as a teacher productivity tool. "But I can feel their dread coming back at me," he tells me.

To win them over, he had them do the math, both literally and figuratively. It is in teaching math in particular where he saw the technology most obviously enhancing student-centered learning.

Here, he opened ChatGPT for his class. He asked the bot to explain the concept of p -value, a probability measure and one of the most important things for students to grasp in statistics. Moments later, the AI gave a pretty good answer. Pretty good, but not great.

So Spencer typed into ChatGPT, "Explain this in simpler terms that a fifteen-year-old would understand."

ChatGPT replied with a new answer, only now it was giving Spencer specific examples to try to build some conceptual understanding in math. If he didn't like it, he could then click the "Try Again" button, and it provided him with a whole new answer. If the response ChatGPT gave was good but still left some questions, Spencer reframed his question again. Let's say the mathematical answer felt a bit too abstract. Spencer simply asked ChatGPT for a concrete example of how a p -value was used in something tangible—say, the context of comic books.

ChatGPT replied, "Sure thing! Suppose you are a comic book publisher and you want to determine if there is a significant difference in the popularity of two superhero characters, ‘Superhero A' and ‘Superhero B,' among comic book readers. To conduct a study, you randomly select a sample of comic book readers and ask them to rate their preference for either Superhero A or Superhero B. The ratings are collected on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating a stronger preference. To determine if there is a statistically significant difference in popularity between the two superheroes, a statistical test, such as a two-sample t-test, can be used. The test, quantifying the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, states that there is no difference in popularity."

What Spencer was doing was giving the AI feedback on what he thought would be more useful. Each answer it gave him was more specific than the previous one, with less academic vocabulary and easier syntax. The point of view even shifted from third person to second person, making the answer more direct and personal.

"My student teachers find that ChatGPT gives them immediate examples to look at, and better lessons that are far more creative and much more rooted in the context of real-life classrooms where they're going to be teaching," Spencer says. If they were getting this much power out of ChatGPT, which was not built for an education use case and which ran off GPT-3.5, imagine what they would soon be able to accomplish using the next-generation artificial intelligence, one specially built for education, complete with memory and the ability to produce in-depth lessons. Khanmigo does a much better job, as well, at understanding where the student is and asking questions to really help the learner digest a concept.

From the earliest days of Khan Academy, we dreamed of a world where students get direct support anytime they want, and their parents, peers, tutors, and teachers have information at their fingertips to offer more help. We did this through dynamic exercises, software, videos, and teacher tools. Yet it still fell short of a full tutoring interaction. Early AI models such as GPT-2 and GPT-3 generated text that appeared coherent but had difficulty with reasoning, especially in abstract math. GPT-4 was the first technology that seemed to have the horsepower to emulate a pedagogically sound tutor. It was much better at math, but it, too, had issues. In the spirit of educated bravery, we decided that perhaps with extra layers of math correction, careful prompting, and help from existing, human-vetted Khan Academy content, we might build upon GPT-4 to make Khanmigo the world's first high-quality AI tutor.

The result is a tutor that not only gets the math far more correct than anyone expected but also gets the tutoring interactions around the math right. It serves as a kind of pedagogy expert, imbued with the proper level of humility, modesty, and curiosity. It is also able to "understand" students as they explain their reasoning. When a student gets stuck on a math problem, the AI tutor will ask, "What do you think is the next step?" And if the student, let's say, does not distribute correctly, our AI "thinks" behind the scenes. That is, Khanmigo considers how it might approach the problem differently. The bot does not share that information with the student. Rather, the AI will often say something like, "Well, I got something a little bit different from you. Can you explain your reasoning to me?" When the student explains his or her reasoning, the AI can now diagnose math gaps we ordinarily might miss without it. It can flag assumptions and highlight blind spots, and then, step-by-step, it will help address misconceptions and fill in any learning gaps.

Here, a student can ask Khanmigo for explanations, for examples, or for instructions. In turn, Khanmigo responds to individual students' math questions and provides tailored explanations, examples, and practice problems. This means that students can learn math at their own pace and focus on areas where they need more support.

Khanmigo is far more nuanced and powerful than ChatGPT. Consider how it answers a student's question on p -values:

STUDENT: What is a p -value?

KHANMIGO: Ah, p -value! It's a fun concept in statistics. But before we dive in, can you tell me what you know about hypothesis testing?

STUDENT: I know a bit.

KHANMIGO: Great! Now, when you perform a hypothesis test, what are you trying to find out?

STUDENT: Whether doing something causes a statistically significant difference.

KHANMIGO: Exactly! Now, where do you think the p -value fits into this process of determining statistical significance?

STUDENT: I don't know.

KHANMIGO: No worries! Let's think about it this way: When you toss a coin, what's the chance of getting heads?

STUDENT: 50 percent.

KHANMIGO: Correct! Now, if you tossed a coin ten times and got heads nine times, would you think something is odd?

STUDENT: Maybe. But there is some chance that that would happen even with a fair coin.

KHANMIGO: Absolutely! Now, can you guess what the p -value might represent in this scenario?

STUDENT: The probability of getting nine out of ten heads?

KHANMIGO: You're on the right track! The p -value is indeed the probability of getting a result as extreme or more extreme than what you observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In our coin example, the null hypothesis would be that the coin is fair. So, the p -value would be the probability of getting nine or more heads in ten flips if the coin is fair. Does that make sense?

STUDENT: So how can you figure out if the null hypothesis isn't true? That the coin isn't fair?

KHANMIGO: Great question! We usually set a threshold, often called the significance level (commonly 0.05). If the p -value is less than this threshold, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting the coin might not be fair. Does that help clarify?

STUDENT: I see! So, you can never be sure that the coin isn't fair. But if you observe something that is very unlikely and thus has a very low p -value (lower than a preset significance level) then it suggests (but doesn't prove) that the null hypothesis isn't true.

KHANMIGO: Bingo! You've got it! Remember, in statistics, we're dealing with uncertainty. So, we can't definitively prove something, but we can gather evidence to support or refute our hypotheses. And that's where the p -value comes in! Do you have any other questions on this topic?

We are closing in on narrowing the math gap we dreamed about achieving all those years ago. As we continue to expand the reaches of generative AI's capabilities, so, too, do we grow its global accessibility. Khanmigo will one day be available to students everywhere, regardless of their learning styles or abilities. At any point, they can use generative AI to reinforce learning and build long-term understanding of math concepts.

Is Khanmigo a replacement for a human teacher? No, and it never will be. But can it be a powerful tool for students who are confused, who need extra help to clarify math concepts, who need a review of ideas? Absolutely! It engages students, asks them to rephrase their questions, challenges them to summarize problems in their own words, and quizzes them with techniques designed to help the information stay in their long-term memory.

Accessing Courses That Students Otherwise Would Not

Supporting students through an AI tutor is a big deal, and it has never been more important, but generative AI is not a complete solution on its own. Even a great human tutor benefits from having a textbook or curriculum to go through. This is, in fact, why I built the first version of Khan Academy back in 2005. I was tutoring my cousins daily, but I wanted them to have more systematic and comprehensive practice, so I created a practice platform where I could monitor their progress. This allowed me to be more productive and focused in our tutoring sessions. So if you want to make a system that can actually hope to teach a student an entire subject, a generative AI–based tutor becomes that much more powerful when paired with a complete course progression (what educators call a complete scope and sequence), which is exactly what Khan Academy has been building from pre-K through college across subjects from its inception.

Our goal is to make education more accessible to everyone. Over the years, we have created courses from kindergarten to college in everything from math and science to civics and history. Those courses included on-demand video and mastery-based practice, as well as tools for parents and teachers to keep track of and further support students. It is meant to raise the ceiling for students who already have the benefit of a supportive classroom environment, but, just as important, to raise the floor for students who might not otherwise have access. This latter case isn't just about kids in rural India or Africa who do not have access to a school.

Based on a 2015 Department of Education report, roughly 50 percent of American high schools don't offer a course in calculus. Forty percent do not offer physics. More than a quarter do not offer chemistry. These numbers get worse for high schools with high Black and Latino enrollment, where 62 percent of high schools do not offer calculus and 49 percent do not offer chemistry. Roughly a quarter of those schools don't even offer Algebra 2.

In most cases, I suspect that the lack of core courses has less to do with a lack of resources and far more to do with the fact that there is not a critical mass of students ready for such coursework. It is hard to resource an Algebra 2 class if only ten students are ready for it. Without having access to Algebra 2, those ten students will not be ready for chemistry or physics or calculus. If you aren't able to take Algebra 2, chemistry, and physics in high school (ideally calculus as well), you will have a difficult time eventually entering a STEM career, regardless of talent, work ethic, or motivation. Even when high schools do offer these courses, they oftentimes dilute the material, because so few students have a strong foundation in the prerequisite material. Because of this, an even smaller percentage of high school students gets the exposure to math and science necessary to succeed in STEM fields in college.

The situation with humanities and writing is not much better; it is just that there may be a little more leeway in the prerequisite material. For instance, it is impossible to engage in calculus if you don't know Algebra 2 well, but one can imagine engaging in college-level history even without a strong foundation in history from high school.

Khan Academy has addressed this by building out these courses and making them accessible to everyone, for free. We have structured them so that a student can work through coursework on their own or with support from others. So if you are in the situation where your school doesn't offer Algebra 2, you could still take Algebra 2 on the platform.

Of course, a minority of students have the motivation to complete a course on their own solely through videos and mastery-based practice. This is why we have proactively added layers of support. One such support is another nonprofit I started during the pandemic called Schoolhouse.world, which has the mission to connect the world through learning by providing free tutoring. It can do this because the tutors are volunteers, oftentimes other high school and college students. This is great, but it is hard for a human tutor to always be around, right when a student is stuck and losing motivation. By having an AI tutor in all subjects, all the time, Khanmigo makes it that much more likely that a student can have sufficient supports to master a course that their school doesn't otherwise offer.

This still raises the question of getting credit for those courses that counts toward college admissions. But we are making headway there as well. In 2023, Caltech, for instance, announced that completing courses on our platform meets its admission requirements.

Nevertheless, we still haven't gotten to what is perhaps the most overlooked, yet most important, role of a tutor: providing motivation and accountability. In the early days when I was tutoring my cousins, I spent a lot of my time tracking them down and guilting them into doing their work. I'd say things like, "I'm committed to helping you, but only if you can commit to showing up and doing the work." If the kids were late for online tutoring, I'd call their mom (my aunt) and ask where they were. When we finally got on the phone or instant messaging, my first questions would be along the lines of, "Were you able to do the practice problems I assigned you?" or "How'd the practice go last night?" If they did the work, I'd compliment them for putting in the effort, and we'd jump into their questions or we'd move forward on new subject matter. If they didn't do what they said they'd do, I'd hold them to account. These conversations provided me with context as we worked together to create new ways to motivate them and keep them accountable to themselves.

We have formalized this type of engagement at Khan Lab School and Khan World School, where advisers regularly check in with students to set goals and hold them accountable. While this is one of the most important parts of the education happening at these schools, most schools or families don't have the resources for this type of personalized attention. Fortunately, the AI can step in to address these needs.

And the users are asking for this. One of the strongest points of feedback that we received from early Khanmigo parents and teachers was that the platform is powerful for students who proactively seek out the AI's help. However, most students neither understand the capabilities of AI nor naturally ask for help, and almost no one wants to be held accountable, even if it is good for them.

Based on that feedback, we have given Khanmigo these capabilities. Imagine AI—with users' permission—being able to email and text teachers, parents, and students to make sure the students are engaged in their learning, stay motivated, and are lightly held to account. This could include check-ins when the students log onto the site and moments for students to reflect on their accomplishment. It also allows for proactive interventions should the students struggle. For instance, a student can get an email saying, "Hey there, you said you wanted to finish unit 3 of Algebra 2 by the end of this month, but you haven't done any work this week. Why don't you click here and we can ensure that you achieve your goals?"

The Most Important Subject-Matter Domain to Master

In the world of education, it's crucial for developers to field-test their ideas. Essentially, it means taking our educational innovations and interventions out of the hypothetical realm and into the real classroom. It's about seeing how our ideas perform in the hands of actual teachers and students. If Khanmigo were a cake, students and teachers would be tasting it to help us refine and improve our recipe so that we might make it the best cake possible. By early 2024, we were piloting Khanmigo with more than thirty thousand teachers and students all over the United States. In this case, they were ensuring that Khanmigo met the needs of learners and educators alike through practical and feasible educational goals and standards.

In those first months, our pilot studies seemed to show us that Khanmigo was helping students level up their skills in STEM and the humanities. Surprisingly, our biggest takeaway in terms of skills learning wasn't at all domain-specific.

The School City of Hobart in Indiana was one of the first districts in the country to use Khanmigo. After they employed the AI for six months, the biggest gains they saw in their students were in the sphere of self-confidence, which is traditionally very difficult to address in a classroom setting. "Student achievement has to start with building confidence within themselves, confidence that comes from the knowledge that they know they can do it," Hobart's superintendent, Peggy Buffington, tells me. "Our job is to make sure that we're equipping our students with a confidence level in their abilities. The AI is a game changer here."

Buffington has seen these gains manifest themselves most plainly when watching the level of engagement increase among students in classrooms that have worked with Khanmigo. Where students were once uncomfortable raising their hands in class to ask questions, they are far less afraid to ask the AI tutor questions, she says. Talking to an AI tutor eliminated the specter of potential public shame or anxiety. "It's making them more engaged, and they love the responses that they get from the AI," she says. "They come to school and they feel confident in their work. As an educator, I am still going to come back and make sure that the students have applied their own thoughts to that work I've assigned to them, but the confidence levels we're seeing the AI building in these kids is amazing."

Tim Krieg, director of secondary curriculum and instruction at School City of Hobart, has an intriguing theory as to why they're seeing such a big boost. It partly comes from a new conceptualization of education, he says, with the AI essentially showing students that domains, or distinctions between subjects, no longer matter.

"The AI breaks down designations," Krieg tells me. With Khanmigo, he says, we can show kids how math works with art, how writing works with science, how history works with economics. "Our students are creators, they're producers, they are songwriters, they are singers, they are podcasters, they are curators of media and information. All of these designations require an increased depth of knowledge," he says. "Learning is nonlinear; it's continuous. AI shows us this integrated world." Our self-confidence, he says, comes from an explicit understanding of the ways everything works together.

Understanding this point puts our kids in a better position to interact with the world both in and out of the classroom. Once you've mastered that knowledge, everything else, comparatively, is a piece of cake.
