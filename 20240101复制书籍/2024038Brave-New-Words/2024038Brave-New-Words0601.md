### 6.1 How AI Will Supercharge Teachers and Teaching

In 2017, a slim man took the stage at the British Science Festival, one of the oldest science festivals in the world. Gazing out on a sea of leading researchers from around the globe, Sir Anthony Seldon, a renowned educator and historian, stated that by 2027 teachers will be AI rather than humans. The coming technology, he said, will force teachers to take a classroom assistant role while technology will be the conveyor of knowledge. Soon, he said, everyone was going to have the very best teacher and a completely personalized educational experience. The software was going to be with you throughout your education journey and was going to move at the speed of every individual learner.

"This is beyond anything that we've seen in the Industrial Revolution, or since, with any other new technology," he said to the audience. "These are adaptive machines that adapt to individuals. They will listen to the voices of the learners, read their faces, and study them in the way gifted teachers study their students."

I agree with Seldon that personalization in learning is an aspiration that we should strive for and that AI is going to play a big role in getting us there. However, I completely disagree with his prediction that this technology will somehow minimize the importance of the human teacher. If anything, it's going to do the opposite.

Teaching is an art form. It is something that takes years of practice and dedication to master. It is natural that some teachers feel nervous about using a tool like generative AI to help them in their teaching. It is natural to worry that by relying too heavily on technology, we might diminish the importance of human interaction and personal relationships between teachers and students. Were this to happen, it could lead to more impersonal learning experiences that would ultimately harm a student's ability to learn and grow. With these AI tools, some might fear students will be able to get answers to their questions without ever needing to interact with an instructor, be it a human teacher, tutor, or helpful parent. The fear is that this will lead to a scenario where teachers feel as if they were no longer needed in the classroom—a scary thought for those who have dedicated their lives to teaching. Teaching is an essential profession, and the demand for capable and impassioned teachers has never diminished. At the end of the day, the biggest fear from educators is the world that Seldon envisions, a world where artificial intelligence reduces demand for teachers.

This dichotomy between useful and harmful technology goes back to the early 1960s and the work of Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist probably best known for his work creating the computer mouse. Others know him for his pioneering efforts on interactive computing and computer networking. Engelbart believed that people were going to use technology to augment their abilities the same way that a tractor augments the work of a farmer to produce food. We'd use these machines, he predicted, to help us work faster, smarter, and better. With large language models catching up to both Engelbart's and Seldon's predictions, will we use artificial intelligence to augment our abilities or will it replace people and make them feel irrelevant?

Let me just say it outright again: there's no job that is safer in the large-language-model world than teaching. Not only are teachers irreplaceable, but AI is going to support teachers so that they can do more of what they enjoy, from deepening personal connections with their students to developing enriching and creative lessons. Like Seldon, I am optimistic about AI's role in education. Where I disagree with him, however, is in the exact role of AI in the classroom. I do not believe machines are going to relegate the teacher to the role of the teaching assistant. Rather, the AI is the teaching assistant.

Still, I feel it's only natural to remain a bit cautious about new technology. Generative AI is going to bring about some major changes, from the nature of student work to the way that teachers teach. Moving through these changes requires employing a bit of educated bravery. How should teachers move past that fear and embrace what's coming to the profession?

"There are basically three things that teachers are going to have to do now as a result of generative AI," says Wharton's Ethan Mollick. He tells me that first teachers are just going to have to expect more from students. "In terms of teaching, you are going to have to adjust in different ways, and that adjustment is going to be different for every teacher. Some teachers are going to change how they go about making writing assignments, perhaps having their students write in class to limit cheating. Others will have students use generative AI to do far more involved projects that classes would not have otherwise assigned without the resource of large language models to draw from. In either case, a teacher's expectations for student work are now much higher than they were before."

When students use generative AI to write papers, for instance, their quality is going to go up, akin to the advent of the word processor leading teachers to expect that their students now create beautifully typed, formatted, well-thought-out essays in ways that the typewriter did not allow.

The second adjustment for teachers, he says, might seem a bit counterintuitive. He encourages teachers to further integrate AI into class assignments. "The AI becomes a teammate with the student," he says. Mollick requires his students to use generative AI to review and critique their work with actionable feedback. Students have to do a pre-mortem with their work before they turn it in for their grade. Projects succeed better when you imagine how they might fail first, allowing students to work backward and solve these problems long before Mollick sees their work.

As for the third teaching adjustment—the biggest—it involves flipping all classrooms.

"Lectures do not make as much sense when I've got tools like ChatGPT that can do truly amazing training, all remotely," he says.

I know a thing or two about the flipped classroom. In my 2011 TED Talk, I mentioned how, even then, teachers around the world were emailing me, telling me that because of the existence of Khan Academy videos, they did not feel that lectures were a good use of class time anymore. If kids could get microlessons in the form of on-demand video, at their own time and pace, class time could be used for Socratic dialogue, collaborative assignments, and supported student work. Essentially, lectures were now happening at home, and "homework" could now happen in a much more interactive classroom environment.

"A lot of stuff just got blown up by ChatGPT, and some of that was good stuff," Mollick tells me. "There are ways we have taught students for two thousand years that made a lot of sense. We have gotten good at lectures, and we have gotten good at giving essays and assignments to do at home. The thing to remember," he says, "is that generative AI also makes a teacher's life easier."

Let's explore how.

AI 如何助力教师和教学

2017 年，在世界上历史最悠久的英国科学节上，著名教育家和历史学家 Sir Anthony Seldon 登台演讲。面对来自全球的顶尖研究人员，他预言到 2027 年，教师将由 AI 取代。他指出，新技术将使教师成为课堂助手，而技术则会成为主要的知识传递者。他提到，不久之后，每个人都将拥有最优秀的教师和完全个性化的教育体验。AI 软件将在整个教育过程中陪伴学习者，并能根据每个学习者的节奏调整。

「这超越了工业革命以来我们见过的任何新技术，」他对观众说道。「这些是能够适应个体的智能机器。它们不仅能倾听学习者的声音，还能读取他们的面部表情，像天才教师那样研究他们。」

我同意 Seldon 的观点，即个性化学习是我们应该追求的目标，而 AI 将在实现这一目标中起到关键作用。然而，我完全不同意他认为这种技术会削弱人类教师的重要性。相反，AI 的发展将使教师的作用更加重要。

教学是一门艺术，需要多年的实践和奉献才能掌握。一些教师对使用生成式 AI（Generative AI）这样的工具感到紧张，这是很正常的。担心过度依赖技术会削弱教师和学生之间的重要互动和关系也是可以理解的。如果真是这样，可能会让学习变得不那么个性化，最终影响学生的学习和成长。有些人担心，学生使用这些 AI 工具后，不再需要与老师、导师或家长互动，就能找到答案。这让一些教师觉得自己在课堂上可能不再被需要，这对那些一生致力于教学的人来说是一个可怕的念头。教学是一项重要的职业，对有能力和热情的教师的需求从未减少。教育者最大的担忧是 Seldon 设想的那种人工智能减少教师需求的世界。

有用和有害技术之间的争论可以追溯到 20 世纪 60 年代早期，计算机科学家 Doug Engelbart 的工作。他可能因创造了计算机鼠标而最为人知，也因其在互动计算和计算机网络方面的开创性努力而备受尊敬。Engelbart 认为，人们会像使用拖拉机提高农民生产力一样，利用技术增强自身能力。他预测，我们会使用这些机器，使我们的工作变得更快、更聪明、更好。随着大语言模型（Large Language Model）逐步实现 Engelbart 和 Seldon 的预言，我们会使用人工智能来增强我们的能力，还是它会取代人们，让他们感到无关紧要？

我再重复一遍：在大语言模型时代，没有比教学更安全的职业。老师不仅不可替代，而且 AI 还将帮助老师，让他们更多地从事自己喜欢的工作，例如加深与学生的个人联系和设计丰富且有创意的课程。和 Seldon 一样，我对 AI 在教育中的作用持乐观态度。不过，我与他的不同意见在于 AI 在课堂中的具体角色。我不认为机器会把老师降级为助教。相反，AI 应该是助教。

尽管如此，我觉得对新技术保持一些谨慎是自然的。生成式 AI 会带来一些重大变化，从学生作业的形式到教师的教学方法。面对这些变化需要一点有教育背景的勇气。教师应该如何克服这种恐惧，迎接职业上的新变化呢？

「生成式 AI 的出现，教师现在需要做三件事，」沃顿商学院的 Ethan Mollick 说。他告诉我，首先，教师需要对学生有更高的期望。「在教学上，你需要用不同的方式进行调整，而这种调整对每个教师来说都是不同的。有些教师可能会改变布置写作作业的方式，可能会让学生在课堂上完成写作以减少作弊。另一些教师可能会让学生使用生成式 AI 完成更复杂的项目，这些项目如果没有大语言模型的支持是不会布置的。不管是哪种情况，教师现在对学生作业的期望比以前高得多。」

当学生使用生成式 AI 写论文时，论文质量会提高，这就像文字处理器的出现使教师期望学生能够创作出格式精美、内容深思熟虑的文章，而这在打字机时代是无法实现的。

他说，第二个教学调整对教师来说可能有些反常。他鼓励教师进一步将 AI 整合到课堂作业中。「AI 会成为学生的队友，」他说。Mollick 要求他的学生使用生成式 AI 审查和批评他们的作业，并提供可操作的反馈。学生必须在提交作业前对其进行预评估。项目在预想可能失败的情况下反而更容易成功，这样学生可以提前解决这些问题，而不是等到 Mollick 看到他们的作业时再解决。

至于第三个也是最大的教学调整，它涉及翻转所有课堂。

「当我有像 ChatGPT 这样的工具可以进行真正惊人的远程训练时，讲座的意义就不大了，」他说。

我对翻转课堂有所了解。在我 2011 年的 TED 演讲中，我提到，世界各地的教师当时已经在给我发邮件，告诉我由于 Khan Academy 视频的存在，他们不再觉得课堂讲座是最好的时间利用。如果孩子们可以通过按需视频在自己的时间和节奏中学习微型课程，那么课堂时间就可以用于苏格拉底式对话、协作任务和辅导学生的工作。本质上，讲座现在在家中进行，而「家庭作业」则在一个更具互动性的课堂环境中进行。

「ChatGPT 确实改变了很多东西，有些改变是好的，」Mollick 告诉我。「我们用了两千年的时间来教学生，很多方法都很有意义。我们已经擅长于讲课，也擅长布置家庭作业和写作任务。需要记住的是，」他说，「生成式 AI（Generative AI）也能让教师的生活变得更轻松。」

让我们来看看如何实现这一点。

### 6.2 Dawn of the AI Teaching Assistant

We have a crisis in teaching. Alongside emergency response workers, police officers, and air traffic controllers, teachers have one of the highest rates of professional exhaustion. As a result, the United States is currently facing a massive teacher shortage. We're talking about a deficit of three hundred thousand teachers, with almost 90 percent of school districts across the country reporting teacher shortages year after year. One of the primary reasons behind this shortage is the lack of support and resources for educators. It probably comes as no surprise that our demands on teachers are huge. Overworked and overstretched, their emotional and mental exhaustion is untenable, with the average teacher working fifty-four hours a week—and as little as 49 percent of that time is spent interacting with students, according to a 2022 study by the EdWeek Research Center. Even after the classroom empties, teachers continue to work late into the night, preparing lesson plans and grading papers. It is no wonder that disillusionment sets in quickly. In the United States, the average teacher turnover rate is only five years, and a quarter of all teachers are thinking about leaving the profession.

Having integrated AI teaching assistants into our platform, our team has learned that large language models can actually make teaching a more sustainable profession. Imagine the local school district suddenly discovering hundreds of millions of dollars and using it to offer every teacher the support of three bright assistants for their classrooms. These assistants would help create lesson plans and rubrics, grade papers, write progress reports, riff with teachers, and support their students. Every teacher on the planet would jump at this opportunity. These assistants do not threaten teaching jobs, but they would actually make teaching jobs sustainable. They would make the work more joyous. Most important, they'd help accelerate learning outcomes for millions of students, making them more prepared for college, careers, and life.

Unfortunately, society does not have the resources to give every teacher three human assistants. The good news, however, is that we are now able to offer educators the AI equivalent. In some ways, this will be even more powerful than what human teaching assistants can do. These AI assistants are available around the clock and work one-on-one with every student in the classroom. They can also proactively engage students and hold them softly accountable. Even more, they can do all the grunt work involved in teaching—writing rubrics, giving students feedback on their essays, and drafting student narrative progress reports for parents.

Generative AI can provide educators with new best practices, teaching techniques, and insights into their students' learning gaps. It's not difficult for the AI teaching assistant to identify a problem area for a group of students and offer corresponding lesson plans for the teacher to use, or for the AI teaching assistant to monitor a student's performance in class and send real-time progress updates to teachers. It even has the capacity to act as a counselor for teachers struggling with burnout. These functions are becoming more common and, with the proper guardrails, can be quite powerful.

For decades, future teachers have been taught that one of the best practices in education is differentiation and active learning. Differentiation is the idea that different students need different things. When Seldon and I talk about personalization, this is what we are referring to. Active learning is the notion that students don't learn best when sitting passively, pretending to pay attention to a lecture, but instead do so when they are actively engaged in discussion, games, projects, and problem-solving. Many new teachers aspire to this but quickly discover that these ideals are difficult to meet in a thirty-person class. The few teachers who can pull this off do so by spending countless hours tweaking lesson plans and creating personalized problem sets. Generative AI tutors support students by answering nuanced questions more fully. At the same time, perhaps the biggest game changer from the teacher perspective is that AI can now help craft lesson plans in minutes.

By freeing educators from the administrative work that so often mires their days, artificial intelligence unlocks time and the resources for teachers. A teacher can go to Khanmigo and type the prompt "Create a ninth-grade lesson plan for teaching World War II." Within seconds, it creates a classroom objective and a six-period lesson plan that includes discussions of major events and battles, an introduction to significant figures who played pivotal roles during World War II, and their ideologies, strategies, and contributions to the war effort, while examining their repercussions and legacies.

From there, a teacher could add to the rough draft of the lesson plan or ask the AI to make the lesson plan more exciting by requesting it to begin the class with a quick poll:

AI TEACHING ASSISTANT: Of course! A quick poll is a great way to engage your students and assess their prior knowledge. Here's a suggestion for a poll question: What do you think was the most significant cause of World War II?

Treaty of Versailles

Rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party

Expansionist policies of Axis Powers

Failure of the League of Nations

If a novice teacher needs some additional information or context, all it takes is a simple new prompt: "Can you write a script for me for the section on historic repercussions of the Treaty of Versailles after World War I?" Moments later, the platform replies with a script. It even provides the teacher with tips to make the lesson more interactive for the students, such as adding more details, examples, and anecdotes.

Let's say the hometown team just won the World Series and that's all the students can think about that day. One prompt from the teacher to Khanmigo—"Can you make this lesson plan related to baseball?"—and the bot will produce in seconds what might take a teacher many hours to create. Khanmigo replies, "Certainly! Here's an updated version of the ninth-grade lesson plan on World War II that incorporates baseball!" The new objective includes exploring the role of baseball during the war. The new lesson plan includes introducing the concept of morale and the role of sports during the war, and discussions about how baseball was affected and the formation of military baseball leagues. It suggests articles that explore the experiences of baseball players who served in the military, such as Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. It also recommends learning about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League portrayed in the Geena Davis movie A League of Their Own .

Perhaps a teacher needs a tangible example to help explain the complexity of the economics that led to World War II. Either the teacher can spend an hour or two looking it up in the library or online or they can simply ask the AI teaching assistant for help. Within seconds of receiving a prompt, Khanmigo responds, "Here's a tangible example using a baseball analogy."

AI TEACHING ASSISTANT: Try this! Imagine a scenario where two baseball teams, Team A and Team B, are competing against each other. Both teams rely on equipment and resources to play the game effectively. Team A produces high-quality baseball bats, while Team B specializes in manufacturing baseball gloves. Before the game, the teams engage in trade to exchange bats and gloves, ensuring that each team has the necessary equipment. However, at some point, Team A decides to impose heavy tariffs on the gloves imported from Team B. This means that Team B's gloves become much more expensive for Team A to purchase. As a result, Team B's economy suffers.

By using this baseball analogy, a teacher can now easily illustrate how trade imbalances, protectionist policies, and economic conflicts disrupted relations between nations, ultimately leading to more significant geopolitical conflicts, much like the complex economics that contributed to World War II.

With each back-and-forth with the AI, the stronger and more precise the lesson becomes. A teacher can push the AI further still and ask it to help come up with a creative student project based on the lesson. The AI teaching assistant replies, "Here are some ideas: Create or find an interactive timeline that highlights key events, leaders, and battles of the war. This will give students a visual representation of the chronology and the global impact of the conflict. Or provide students with primary source materials like speeches, letters, and photographs to analyze and interpret. This will help them develop critical thinking skills and gain a deeper understanding of the historical context."

The benefits for teachers go beyond the planning and administrative work of writing, creating, and crafting lessons; grading papers; and communicating with parents. AIs will be able to eventually facilitate classroom breakouts between students, give teachers real-time help and feedback on ways to better engage students, and let teachers know which students likely need their attention the most.

Seldon had us thinking that robots might take over teaching, but the reality is far cooler than the stuff of science fiction. The future of AI in education is about teaming up with technology to make education even better. In other words, AI is not here to steal the show from teachers; it's here to help teachers steal the show. It's the trusty wingman that tackles the boring stuff, sparks creativity, supercharges lessons, and helps educators craft unforgettable learning experiences that light up students' minds.

Done well, not only will this make students' experiences great, but it will bring back joy to so many of those in the teaching profession. I'm not claiming that technology will solve recruitment and burnout issues on its own. There are many other issues that need to be considered, including teacher pay. But we have an obligation to pursue anything that makes teachers' lives easier.

At the end of the day, we find that what really matters to students is not technology so much as having human-to-human connection in the classroom. Remove the teacher and you remove the critical element foundational to all learning. Unlike Seldon's prediction, teachers will always be in command of their classes, and thank goodness for that.

AI 教学助手的崛起

教学领域正面临一场危机。和应急响应人员、警察以及空中交通管制员一样，教师也是职业倦怠率最高的职业之一。因此，美国目前正面临严重的教师短缺问题。我们谈的是三十万教师的缺口，全国近 90% 的学区每年都报告教师短缺问题。造成这种短缺的主要原因之一是对教育工作者支持和资源的不足。我们对教师的要求非常高，这可能并不令人意外。由于工作量大和压力大，他们的情绪和精神上的疲惫难以承受。根据 EdWeek 研究中心 2022 年的一项研究，平均每位教师每周工作 54 小时，而其中只有 49% 的时间是与学生互动的。即使在教室空无一人之后，教师们仍然要工作到深夜，准备课程计划和批改作业。难怪他们很快就会感到失望和疲惫。在美国，教师的平均在职时间只有五年，四分之一的教师正在考虑离开这个职业。

将 AI 教学助理引入我们的平台后，我们发现，大语言模型能让教学这份职业变得更加可持续。试想一下，如果当地学区突然获得数亿美元的资金，并用这些钱为每位教师配备三位聪明的助教，这些助教可以帮助制定课程计划和评分标准、批改作业、撰写进度报告，与教师互动，并支持学生的学习。每位教师都会乐于接受这样的机会。这些助教不仅不会威胁教师的工作，反而会让教学工作变得更加可持续和愉快。最重要的是，他们能加速数百万学生的学习成果，让他们更好地为大学、职业和生活做好准备。

遗憾的是，社会并没有资源为每一位教师提供三名人类助教。不过，令人欣喜的是，我们现在可以为教育工作者提供等效的 AI 助理。在某些方面，这些 AI 助理甚至比人类助教更强大。它们全天候可用，并能与每位学生进行一对一的互动，还能主动激励学生并温和地督促他们完成任务。更重要的是，它们可以完成教学中所有繁琐的工作，如编写评分标准、为学生的作文提供反馈以及为家长撰写学生的进度报告。

生成式 AI（Generative AI）可以为教育工作者带来全新的最佳实践、教学技巧和对学生学习差距的洞见。AI 教学助手能够轻松地识别一组学生的问题区域，并为教师提供相应的课程计划；它还可以在课堂上监控学生表现，实时向教师发送进度更新。甚至，它还能作为教师的顾问，帮助他们应对职业倦怠。这些功能变得越来越普遍，并且在适当的防范措施下，能发挥巨大的作用。

几十年来，教育领域一直强调差异化教学和主动学习。差异化教学的理念是，不同的学生需要不同的教育方式。当 Seldon 和我谈论个性化教育时，指的就是这个。主动学习则认为，学生在被动听讲时效果不佳，只有在积极参与讨论、游戏、项目和问题解决时，才能学得更好。许多新教师都希望实现这些目标，但很快发现，在一个三十人的班级里很难做到。少数能够实现的教师，通常是通过花费大量时间调整课程计划和创建个性化问题集来完成的。生成式 AI 家教能通过更详细地回答复杂问题来支持学生。而对于教师来说，最大的改变可能是 AI 现在能够在几分钟内帮助制定课程计划。

通过让教育工作者摆脱那些常常困扰他们的行政工作，人工智能为教师节省了时间和资源。教师可以打开 Khanmigo 并输入提示「创建一个九年级的二战教学计划」。几秒钟内，系统就会生成一个教学目标和六节课的教学计划，包括讨论主要事件和战斗，介绍在二战期间扮演关键角色的重要人物及其意识形态、策略和对战争的贡献，同时研究其影响和遗产。

在此基础上，教师可以在教学计划草稿上进行补充，或者让 AI 使教学计划更加有趣，比如请求它以快速投票开始课程：

AI TEACHING ASSISTANT：当然！快速投票是吸引学生和评估他们先前知识的好方法。这里有一个投票问题的建议：你认为二战最重要的原因是什么？

凡尔赛条约阿道夫·希特勒和纳粹党的崛起轴心国的扩张政策国联的失败如果一位新手教师需要一些额外的信息或背景，只需一个简单的新提示：「你能为我写一个关于凡尔赛条约在一战后的历史影响部分的脚本吗？」片刻之后，平台会生成一个脚本。它甚至还会提供一些提示，帮助教师使课程更加生动有趣，比如添加更多细节、例子和轶事。

假设家乡球队刚刚赢得了世界大赛，学生们整天都在谈论这件事。教师只需向 Khanmigo 提出一个请求 ——「你能把这个课程计划和棒球联系起来吗？」——AI 辅助教学工具就能在几秒钟内生成一个可能需要教师花费数小时才能完成的课程计划。Khanmigo 回答道：「当然可以！这是一个结合了棒球元素的九年级世界大战课程计划更新版！」新的课程目标包括探讨棒球在战争期间的作用。更新后的课程计划包括介绍士气的概念以及体育在战争中的意义，并讨论棒球如何受到影响和军事棒球联盟的形成。它建议学生阅读一些关于服役棒球运动员经历的文章，例如 Ted Williams 和 Joe DiMaggio。它还推荐学习由 Geena Davis 主演的电影《红粉联盟》中描绘的全美女子职业棒球联盟。

可能教师需要一个具体的例子来帮助解释导致第二次世界大战的经济复杂性。教师可以花费一到两个小时在图书馆或网上查找，或者他们可以直接向 AI 教学助手寻求帮助。在收到请求的几秒钟内，Khanmigo 回应道：「这里有一个使用棒球类比的具体例子。」

AI 教学助手：试试这个！想象一个场景，两个棒球队，球队 A 和球队 B，正在相互竞争。两支球队都依赖设备和资源来有效地进行比赛。球队 A 生产高质量的棒球棒，而球队 B 专门制造棒球手套。比赛前，双方通过贸易交换棒球棒和手套，确保每支球队都有所需的设备。然而，在某个时刻，球队 A 决定对从球队 B 进口的手套征收高额关税。这意味着球队 B 的手套对球队 A 来说变得更加昂贵。结果，球队 B 的经济因此受到了影响。

通过这个棒球类比，教师可以更容易地解释贸易失衡、保护主义政策和经济冲突如何破坏国家间关系，最终引发更严重的地缘政治冲突，就像复杂的经济因素促成了第二次世界大战一样。

每次与 AI 互动，课程变得越来越完善和精准。教师还可以进一步利用 AI，设计基于课程的创意学生项目。AI 教学助手建议说：「你可以创建或找到一个互动时间线，展示战争的关键事件、领导人和战役。这将为学生提供直观的时间顺序和全球影响展示。或者，提供演讲、信件和照片等原始资料，让学生进行分析和解释。这将帮助他们培养批判性思维，并更深入地理解历史背景。」

对于教师来说，AI 的好处不仅限于编写、创建和制作课程的规划和行政工作，批改作业，以及与家长沟通。AI 还可以在课堂上促进学生分组讨论，为教师提供实时的帮助和反馈，帮助他们更好地吸引学生，并提醒哪些学生需要更多关注。

Seldon 曾让我们以为机器人会接管教学，但现实比科幻小说更令人兴奋。AI 在教育中的未来是与技术合作，共同提升教育质量。换句话说，AI 不是来抢教师的风头，而是来帮助教师更好地发挥作用。它是可靠的助手，处理繁琐的工作，激发创造力，增强课程效果，帮助教育者打造难忘的学习体验，让学生的思维焕发光彩。

如果做得好，这不仅能让学生的学习体验更加愉快，还能让许多教师重新找回工作的乐趣。我并不是说技术能够单独解决教师招聘和职业倦怠的问题。还有诸如教师工资等其他问题需要解决。但我们有责任去追求任何能让教师工作更轻松的方法。

最终，我们发现对学生来说，真正重要的不是技术，而是课堂上的人际互动。如果没有老师，学习的关键要素就会缺失。与 Seldon 的预测相反，教师将永远掌控他们的课堂，这真是一件值得庆幸的事。

### 6.3 Helping Build Alternative Education Models

Today, roughly three million parents are homeschooling their kids in the United States, and the number is only rising. People homeschool for different reasons, but often they feel that traditional school models don't adequately meet their child's individual needs and interests. It might be fear that fixed-pace instruction will leave their child with more and more gaps that get harder to fix and can undermine a student's confidence. It could be that their child is ready to accelerate or go much deeper than traditional schools may allow.

Still, homeschooling comes with its own set of concerns. Will the child have opportunities for socialization with young people their own age? Do the parents have enough subject matter expertise to support their children in a broad range of subjects? Do the parents have the time, flexibility, and financial resources to properly support their children's learning and development? How does a homeschooled student prove to colleges that they have mastery of material (especially when their parents are doing a lot of the grading)?

Even before considering AI, we and others have been creating comprehensive courses that students can work through in their own time and at their own pace in nearly all core academic subjects, from pre-K through college. These platforms have teacher and parent tools to monitor student progress and make assignments. Parents and teachers can also use these platforms to refresh their own knowledge. The most efficacious platforms are also transparent and free.

New modalities are starting to come online for human-to-human support. For example, Schoolhouse.world provides free, live, small-group tutoring. Not only does that supply rich academic support, it allows young people from all over the world to safely learn alongside one another over Zoom, which provides some socialization. Many of the best Schoolhouse.world volunteer tutors are, in fact, high school students, so it even provides an outlet for service and leadership beyond the walls of the home school.

Students in nontraditional academic environments can leverage these platforms for credit and college admissions. The University of Chicago, MIT, CalTech, Brown, Yale, Georgia Tech, Ohio State, USC, Columbia, and many other universities already consider Schoolhouse.world transcripts for admissions. These transcripts show a mastery of topics based on peer-reviewed recordings of the student getting over 90 percent correct on Khan Academy assessments. They also showcase the quantity and quality of help the student has provided to others on the platform. CalTech, in fact, accepts this transcript to meet its high school course requirements. In other words, if you master all the required subjects on Khan Academy and prove it for the Schoolhouse.world transcript, CalTech will consider you even if you never took those courses from a traditional school.

Even though platforms such as these were not purpose-built for homeschoolers, they have increasingly become go-to resources for that community. They save homeschoolers countless hours (and dollars) that would have otherwise been used to kludge together coursework, support their students in a personalized way, and then prove to colleges that the students have actually learned the material.

Generative AI can now take this to another level. Like students in more traditional schools, homeschooled students can leverage AI tutors like Khanmigo to unblock them academically. They can also use the AI to engage in a debate or simulation. Rather than facilitate cheating, the AI can give real-time feedback and support on how to write better. The AI can act as a coach or guidance counselor to help the student navigate college admissions and career choices that their parents might not have expertise in. Homeschooled students arguably have more time and flexibility to pursue their unique passions. Now they can work with generative AI to create music, movies, and games that a decade ago would cost thousands (or millions) of dollars to produce.

This technology can also help parents. The AI can report back to them exactly what their children have been up to and where they need more support. It can act as a coach or tutor to the parents themselves as they try to refresh their own knowledge or problem-solve how to support their children better.

And all of this isn't just for homeschoolers. Anyone looking for academic alternatives can view these kinds of platforms as building blocks without having to reinvent everything from scratch. "Pod schoolers," a group of families pooling resources together to collectively educate their children, can use this. Anyone looking to start a new school no longer has to reinvent all of these courses, tools, and supports. Even traditional schools can use pieces of this à la carte to give families more options and flexibility.

Just as I don't think one-size-fits-all is great for setting the pace in an academic environment, I also don't think that one type of schooling is better or worse for all families. There are many students who thrive in traditional schools. There are families who value the flexibility and independence of homeschooling. A lot of people exist in between. Until recently, however, many families felt limited in their options for lack of time, money, or know-how. The world of online platforms and generative AI is going to help break down some of these barriers and give more folks the agency to find options that work for them.

如今，美国有大约三百万家长选择在家教育他们的孩子，而且这个数字还在不断增长。人们选择家庭教育的原因各不相同，但通常是因为他们认为传统学校模式无法充分满足孩子的个性化需求和兴趣。家长们可能担心固定进度的教学会导致孩子出现越来越多的知识空白，从而影响孩子的自信心。也可能是因为他们的孩子准备加速学习或深入探究，而传统学校无法提供这样的机会。

然而，家庭教育也面临一些挑战。孩子是否有机会与同龄人社交？家长是否具备足够的学科知识来支持孩子在各个领域的学习？家长是否有时间、灵活性和经济能力来全面支持孩子的学习和成长？家庭教育的学生如何向大学证明他们掌握了教材，尤其是当评分工作主要由家长完成时？

即便在考虑 AI 之前，我们和其他人已经开发了一系列全面的课程，几乎涵盖所有核心学科，从学前班到大学。这些课程允许学生在自己的时间和节奏中完成。平台还提供教师和家长工具来监控学生进度和布置作业，家长和教师也可以用这些平台来复习自己的知识。最有效的平台通常都是透明且免费的。

现在，一些新模式开始上线，提供人对人的支持。例如，Schoolhouse.world 提供免费、实时的小组辅导，不仅能提供丰富的学术支持，还允许来自世界各地的年轻人通过 Zoom 安全地一起学习，增加社交机会。事实上，许多优秀的 Schoolhouse.world 志愿导师本身就是高中生，这也为他们提供了一个展示服务和领导力的平台。

非传统学术环境的学生可以利用这些平台获得学分和大学录取。芝加哥大学、麻省理工学院、加州理工学院、布朗大学、耶鲁大学、乔治亚理工学院、俄亥俄州立大学、南加州大学、哥伦比亚大学等许多大学已经接受 Schoolhouse.world 的成绩单。这些成绩单显示学生通过 Khan Academy 评估测试获得超过 90% 正确率，并记录了学生在平台上帮助他人的数量和质量。事实上，加州理工学院已经将这些成绩单作为满足其高中课程要求的一部分。换句话说，如果你在 Khan Academy 上掌握了所有必需科目并在 Schoolhouse.world 的成绩单中证明这一点，加州理工学院会考虑录取你，即使你没有在传统学校上过这些课程。

尽管这些平台最初并非为家庭学校（homeschoolers）设计，但它们已经逐渐成为该社区的首选资源。这些平台为家庭学校节省了大量的时间和金钱，避免了他们需要自己拼凑课程、个性化支持学生，并向大学证明学生确实掌握了所学内容的麻烦。

生成式 AI（Generative AI）现在可以将这一切提升到新的高度。就像传统学校的学生一样，家庭学校的学生可以利用像 Khanmigo 这样的 AI 导师来解决他们在学术上的困难。他们还可以使用 AI 进行辩论或模拟。AI 不仅不会助长作弊，还可以提供实时反馈和支持，帮助学生提高写作水平。AI 可以充当教练或指导顾问，帮助学生在大学招生和职业选择上做出明智的决策，这些方面可能是他们的父母不擅长的。可以说，家庭学校的学生有更多的时间和灵活性来追求他们独特的兴趣。现在，他们可以与生成式 AI 一起创作音乐、电影和游戏，这些在十年前可能需要花费数千甚至数百万美元来制作。

这种技术还可以帮助父母。AI 可以向他们报告孩子的具体活动以及需要更多支持的地方。它还可以作为教练或导师，帮助父母刷新知识或解决如何更好地支持孩子的问题。

这一切不仅仅是为家庭学校的学生准备的。任何寻找学术替代方案的人都可以将这些平台视为构建块，而无需从头开始重新发明一切。「Pod schoolers」，即那些将资源集中在一起共同教育孩子的家庭群体，可以利用这一点。任何想要开设新学校的人也不需要重新开发所有这些课程、工具和支持。甚至传统学校也可以按需使用这些资源，为家庭提供更多的选择和灵活性。

正如在学术环境中不应采取一刀切的方式来设定进度一样，我也不认为某种教育模式对所有家庭来说都是最佳选择。很多学生在传统学校表现得很好，而有些家庭则更看重家庭教育的灵活性和独立性。其实，大多数人在这两者之间。然而，直到最近，许多家庭因为时间、金钱或知识的限制，选择上感到很受限。如今，在线平台和生成式 AI（Generative AI）的发展将帮助打破这些障碍，让更多人有机会找到适合自己的教育方式。

### 6.4 Fixing Cheating in College

Every dynamic that makes AI challenging and transformative in secondary education becomes more pronounced in higher education, where students are given more independence. Writing term papers, for instance, can be part of a rigorous high school experience, but in some liberal arts college programs, papers make up the bulk of what a student does in their four years. If ChatGPT-generated writing is a problem in high school, it is an even bigger problem in college. This issue isn't limited to humanities classes but a pplies to any course in which colleges expect students to design or produce original work.

One solution is for universities to simply trust students. Honor codes have been in place for decades at many institutions. Under these policies, students are left to do assignments on their own, from writing papers to taking tests in dorm rooms. At Stanford, for example, until recently professors weren't allowed to proctor in-class exams even if they wanted to.

Unfortunately, by most accounts, honor codes can actually create dishonorable environments where those who play by the rules feel that they are at a clear disadvantage to those who cheat, oftentimes openly. Worse, honor codes put the burden on students to police one another, even though social pressures make it unlikely that they will report on their fellow classmates. And when students do report cheating, it often becomes one person's word against another's.

Students are more comfortable cheating in college than you might expect. According to a 2021 Inside Higher Ed Student Voice survey, 47 percent of respondents found it "somewhat or very acceptable" to use "websites to find answers to test or homework questions." Another Inside Higher Ed report quotes a fourth-year Stanford graduate student saying that cheating has become "part of the fabric of the university . . . no one respects the honor code in its current form—not graduate students, not faculty, not undergraduates."

While I can understand why students might want to seek out help with homework, the pervasiveness of students thinking it's acceptable to get answers for test questions shows an incredible breakdown in academic integrity. Add to this mix the sudden ubiquity of AI tools and a bad situation becomes even worse.

Stanford is not an anomaly here. According to a 2023 survey at Middlebury College, nearly two-thirds of students responded that they have broken the school's honor code, while 32 percent say they have cheated on a test, and 15 percent say that they had "unauthorized use of AI tools/ChatGPT."

These trends are why, in the 2023–2024 school year, Stanford reversed its policy on proctoring, so that professors are now allowed to be in the room when students take an exam. According to Debra Satz, the dean of the School of Humanities and Science, "The undergrads have themselves also pulled out of the contract by the lack of taking responsibility. I don't blame them . . . I think we're seeing an unraveling of a culture where students who don't want to cheat are in an environment where they feel like everybody else is cheating."

Of course, cheating impacted college essays and term papers long before the existence of ChatGPT. In 2019—more than three years before ChatGPT was publicly released— The New York Times profiled college graduates in places like Nigeria and Kenya making a living writing essays for college students in America and other wealthy countries. They are given this work through online intermediaries, and even a quick web search for "write my research paper for me cheaply" shows how ubiquitous these services remain today.

In other words, generative AI is putting a spotlight on an issue that has existed for years. Colleges have either been blissfully ignorant of the situation or just haven't known what to do about it. Regardless, this is a problem that needs to be addressed, otherwise it will undermine the value of a college degree and perpetuate rewarding young people with integrity problems. We know that today's low-integrity college students are tomorrow's low-integrity leaders in business and government.

The good news is that there are solutions. For example, having students work on their writing and papers in class allows them to get support from both the professor and other students. It makes class time more active. Longer essays can be done over multiple class periods. Indeed, this is a variation on the flipped classroom that we have advocated for in math and science; students should do what used to be homework in class and watch recorded lectures on their own time.

Of course, there are important benefits to having students write essays independently, such as developing their ability to plan and not procrastinate, both of which are skills arguably as useful as learning to write. To address this, some professors have attempted to police cheating by having students show more of their process along the way, from outline to first draft to final paper. Unfortunately, it isn't hard to outsource an outline or a first draft to an overseas writer for nine dollars a page or to ChatGPT.

But what if we could go one step further and have the AI actually support the student while making the process transparent to the professor? In Khanmigo, we are developing the ability for a professor to create both an assignment and a grading rubric with the AI and then prompt students to complete tasks through the application. The professor can decide how much support the AI should provide. This could entail basic proctoring in which the application takes periodic snapshots of the paper as the student is writing it, or it could act like a full-fledged writing coach, riffing with the student on possible thesis topics, giving them feedback on their outline, and then providing initial feedback on the essay. This feedback could look at everything from grammar to vetting the quality of the references to estimating what grade the student will likely receive. Then, when the student is ready to submit the essay, the AI could send a report to the professor:

KHANMIGO: Sal and I worked on the essay for about five hours total. He had a little trouble deciding on a thesis statement, but I helped nudge him to pick one. I gave some light feedback on the outline, asking him to make his argument on states' rights stronger. I also think the reference he initially chose for that argument was the most legitimate one. Based on the rubric we created, I'd give the paper a B+ in its current form. If you agree with that assessment, I can work with him to improve it further. Click on the following link to view the entire transcript of our interaction. Overall, I am confident that he did this paper with me and didn't cheat. Not only did the interaction seem authentic, but Sal's writing style and level seemed consistent with the writing that he has been doing inside the classroom.

If the student completed the assignment using an essay-writing farm or ChatGPT and copied and pasted it into the assignment, Khanmigo could report it to the professor:

KHANMIGO: We worked together on this paper for five minutes. For the most part, the paper just seemed to be prewritten somewhere else and pasted in. The writing level is also significantly more advanced than what Sal has done in his classwork. It is very possible that Sal used inappropriate help in creating it. Click on the following link to view the entire transcript of our interaction.

This type of transparency addresses many issues at once. It focuses on the process, helping the student while mitigating cheating. And even if a student enlists a friend (or AI) to try to engage with Khanmigo on their behalf, the final product would likely be inconsistent with the student's in-class, proctored writing samples. Teachers will receive a preliminary assessment, cutting down grading time, which allows them to devote more energy for themselves and their students. Last, but not least, students will get much more timely feedback and support to improve their writing.

Dwelling a bit on the value of providing rapid feedback, it would be very hard to get better at basketball free throws if you didn't know whether or not you made the basket for several days or weeks. As ridiculous as this sounds, this is exactly what happens with writing practice. Before generative AI came on the scene, it could take days or weeks before students got feedback on their papers. By that point, they may have forgotten much of what they had written, and there wouldn't be a chance for them to refine their work. Contrast this to the vision in which students receive immediate feedback on every dimension of their writing from the AI. They will have the chance to practice, iterate, and improve much faster.

This applies to any type of independent student work, not just writing. We can see that, done well, generative AI can not only address long-standing issues with cheating, but it can bring about a richer and more productive learning experience for students. Best of all, by thoughtfully embracing the technology, colleges will better prepare their students for the world that they will be graduating into.

解决大学里的作弊问题

在高等教育中，AI 带来的挑战和变化更加明显，因为大学生享有更多的独立性。比如，写学期论文可能是高中严格学习的一部分，但在一些文科大学课程中，论文几乎占据了学生四年学习的大部分内容。如果 ChatGPT 生成的文章在高中是个问题，那么在大学里问题更严重。这不仅是人文学科的问题，而是所有需要学生设计或创作原创作品的课程都会遇到的问题。

一个解决办法是大学要信任学生。许多大学多年来一直实行荣誉守则。在这些制度下，学生必须独立完成作业，从写论文到在宿舍里参加考试。例如，在斯坦福大学，直到最近，即使教授想要，也不能在课堂上监考。

不幸的是，据大多数人的看法，荣誉准则实际上可能会导致不光彩的环境，那些遵守规则的学生会觉得自己明显处于公开作弊的同学的劣势。更糟糕的是，荣誉准则让学生有责任监督彼此，但社交压力往往使他们难以举报同学。而当学生举报作弊时，通常会变成一人对一人的说法之争。

学生在大学里作弊的情况比你想象的更普遍。根据 2021 年《Inside Higher Ed》的一项学生调查，47% 的受访者认为「使用网站查找考试或作业问题答案」是「有点或非常可接受的」。另一份《Inside Higher Ed》的报告引用了一位斯坦福大学四年级研究生的话，他说作弊已经成为「大学的一部分…… 没有人尊重现行的荣誉准则 —— 无论是研究生、教师还是本科生。」

虽然我可以理解学生为何会寻求作业帮助，但认为获取考试答案是可以接受的这种普遍现象显示了学术诚信的严重破裂。加上 AI 工具的突然普及，情况变得更加糟糕。

斯坦福大学并非特例。根据 2023 年米德尔伯里学院的一项调查，近三分之二的学生表示他们违反了学校的荣誉准则，32% 的学生表示他们在考试中作弊，15% 的学生承认「未经授权使用 AI 工具或 ChatGPT」。

这些趋势导致斯坦福大学在 2023-2024 学年改变了监考政策，现在教授可以在学生考试时在场。人文与科学学院院长 Debra Satz 表示：「由于缺乏责任感，本科生们自己也放弃了契约。我不责怪他们…… 我认为我们正在目睹一种文化的崩溃，在这种文化中，不想作弊的学生觉得周围的人都在作弊。」

实际上，早在 ChatGPT 出现之前，作弊就已经影响了大学的作文和学期论文。2019 年，《纽约时报》曾报道，来自尼日利亚和肯尼亚的大学毕业生通过为美国和其他富裕国家的大学生代写论文来谋生。他们通过在线中介获得工作，甚至只需在网上搜索「便宜的代写研究论文」就能发现这些服务今天依然非常普遍。

换句话说，生成式 AI（Generative AI）只是让一个存在多年的问题更加显眼。大学要么对此视而不见，要么不知道该如何应对。不管怎样，这个问题必须得到解决，否则将会削弱大学学位的价值，并继续让那些有诚信问题的年轻人受益。我们知道，今天缺乏诚信的大学生就是明天商业和政府中缺乏诚信的领导者。

好消息是，有一些解决方案。例如，让学生在课堂上完成写作和论文，这样他们可以得到教授和同学的帮助，使课堂更加活跃。较长的论文可以分多节课完成。实际上，这类似于我们在数学和科学中提倡的翻转课堂；学生在课堂上完成原本的作业任务，在课外时间观看录制的讲座。

当然，让学生独立写作也有重要的好处，比如培养他们的计划能力和避免拖延的习惯，这些技能和学习写作一样重要。为了解决这个问题，一些教授尝试通过让学生展示从大纲到初稿再到最终论文的整个过程来防止作弊。然而，将大纲或初稿外包给海外写手每页九美元或使用 ChatGPT 并不难。

但如果我们更进一步，利用 AI 来支持学生，同时让教授能够透明地了解整个过程呢？在 Khanmigo 中，我们正在开发一种功能，让教授可以与 AI 一起创建作业和评分标准，并通过应用程序提示学生完成任务。教授可以决定 AI 提供的支持程度。这可能包括基本的监考功能，应用程序会在学生写作时定期拍摄论文的快照，或者作为一个全方位的写作教练，与学生讨论可能的论题，提供大纲反馈，并对论文提供初步意见。这些反馈可以涵盖从语法检查到参考文献质量审核，再到预测学生可能获得的分数。然后，当学生准备提交论文时，AI 可以向教授发送一份报告：

KHANMIGO：Sal 和我总共花了大约五个小时写这篇文章。他在决定论文主题句时遇到了一些困难，但我帮他做了决定。我对大纲给了一些简单的反馈，建议他加强关于州权的论点。我也认为他最初选择的参考文献是最合理的。根据我们创建的评分标准，目前这篇文章我会给 B+ 的评分。如果你同意这个评估，我可以继续帮助他改进。点击以下链接查看我们互动的完整记录。总的来说，我相信这篇文章是他和我一起完成的，没有作弊。互动不仅显得很真实，而且 Sal 的写作风格和水平也与他在课堂上的表现一致。

如果学生使用了代写服务或 ChatGPT 完成作业并直接复制粘贴到作业中，Khanmigo 可以向教授报告：

KHANMIGO：我们在这篇文章上只合作了五分钟。大多数情况下，这篇文章看起来像是从其他地方预先写好的然后粘贴进来的。写作水平也明显比 Sal 在课堂上的作业高出很多。很有可能 Sal 在写作过程中使用了不适当的帮助。点击以下链接查看我们互动的完整记录。

这种透明度可以同时解决多个问题。它注重过程，帮助学生的同时减少作弊行为。即使学生找朋友（或 AI）代替他们与 Khanmigo 互动，最终的作品也可能与学生在课堂上监考下完成的写作样本不一致。教师将收到初步评估，减少评分时间，从而可以投入更多精力给自己和学生。最后但同样重要的是，学生将获得更及时的反馈和支持以改进他们的写作。

谈到快速反馈的重要性，想象一下如果你在投篮后几天甚至几周都不知道自己是否投中了球，那要提高篮球罚球技术就会非常困难。虽然这听起来很荒谬，但这正是以前写作练习中的情况。在生成式 AI（Generative AI）出现之前，学生们常常要等几天或几周才能得到论文反馈。到那时，他们可能已经忘记了自己写了什么，也没有机会改进作品。相比之下，想象一下学生们在写作的每个方面都能立即从 AI 获得反馈。他们将能够更快地练习、迭代和提升。

这种情况不仅限于写作，任何类型的独立学生工作都是如此。可以看到，如果使用得当，生成式 AI 不仅能解决长期存在的作弊问题，还能为学生带来更丰富、更高效的学习体验。最重要的是，通过合理地接受这项技术，大学能够更好地为学生准备他们即将进入的社会。
