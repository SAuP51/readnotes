## Part VI: Teaching in the Age of AI

I am indebted to my father for living, but to my teacher for living well.

—Alexander the Great

A teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron.

How AI Will Supercharge Teachers and Teaching

In 2017, a slim man took the stage at the British Science Festival, one of the oldest science festivals in the world. Gazing out on a sea of leading researchers from around the globe, Sir Anthony Seldon, a renowned educator and historian, stated that by 2027 teachers will be AI rather than humans. The coming technology, he said, will force teachers to take a classroom assistant role while technology will be the conveyor of knowledge. Soon, he said, everyone was going to have the very best teacher and a completely personalized educational experience. The software was going to be with you throughout your education journey and was going to move at the speed of every individual learner.

"This is beyond anything that we've seen in the Industrial Revolution, or since, with any other new technology," he said to the audience. "These are adaptive machines that adapt to individuals. They will listen to the voices of the learners, read their faces, and study them in the way gifted teachers study their students."

I agree with Seldon that personalization in learning is an aspiration that we should strive for and that AI is going to play a big role in getting us there. However, I completely disagree with his prediction that this technology will somehow minimize the importance of the human teacher. If anything, it's going to do the opposite.

Teaching is an art form. It is something that takes years of practice and dedication to master. It is natural that some teachers feel nervous about using a tool like generative AI to help them in their teaching. It is natural to worry that by relying too heavily on technology, we might diminish the importance of human interaction and personal relationships between teachers and students. Were this to happen, it could lead to more impersonal learning experiences that would ultimately harm a student's ability to learn and grow. With these AI tools, some might fear students will be able to get answers to their questions without ever needing to interact with an instructor, be it a human teacher, tutor, or helpful parent. The fear is that this will lead to a scenario where teachers feel as if they were no longer needed in the classroom—a scary thought for those who have dedicated their lives to teaching. Teaching is an essential profession, and the demand for capable and impassioned teachers has never diminished. At the end of the day, the biggest fear from educators is the world that Seldon envisions, a world where artificial intelligence reduces demand for teachers.

This dichotomy between useful and harmful technology goes back to the early 1960s and the work of Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist probably best known for his work creating the computer mouse. Others know him for his pioneering efforts on interactive computing and computer networking. Engelbart believed that people were going to use technology to augment their abilities the same way that a tractor augments the work of a farmer to produce food. We'd use these machines, he predicted, to help us work faster, smarter, and better. With large language models catching up to both Engelbart's and Seldon's predictions, will we use artificial intelligence to augment our abilities or will it replace people and make them feel irrelevant?

Let me just say it outright again: there's no job that is safer in the large-language-model world than teaching. Not only are teachers irreplaceable, but AI is going to support teachers so that they can do more of what they enjoy, from deepening personal connections with their students to developing enriching and creative lessons. Like Seldon, I am optimistic about AI's role in education. Where I disagree with him, however, is in the exact role of AI in the classroom. I do not believe machines are going to relegate the teacher to the role of the teaching assistant. Rather, the AI is the teaching assistant.

Still, I feel it's only natural to remain a bit cautious about new technology. Generative AI is going to bring about some major changes, from the nature of student work to the way that teachers teach. Moving through these changes requires employing a bit of educated bravery. How should teachers move past that fear and embrace what's coming to the profession?

"There are basically three things that teachers are going to have to do now as a result of generative AI," says Wharton's Ethan Mollick. He tells me that first teachers are just going to have to expect more from students. "In terms of teaching, you are going to have to adjust in different ways, and that adjustment is going to be different for every teacher. Some teachers are going to change how they go about making writing assignments, perhaps having their students write in class to limit cheating. Others will have students use generative AI to do far more involved projects that classes would not have otherwise assigned without the resource of large language models to draw from. In either case, a teacher's expectations for student work are now much higher than they were before."

When students use generative AI to write papers, for instance, their quality is going to go up, akin to the advent of the word processor leading teachers to expect that their students now create beautifully typed, formatted, well-thought-out essays in ways that the typewriter did not allow.

The second adjustment for teachers, he says, might seem a bit counterintuitive. He encourages teachers to further integrate AI into class assignments. "The AI becomes a teammate with the student," he says. Mollick requires his students to use generative AI to review and critique their work with actionable feedback. Students have to do a pre-mortem with their work before they turn it in for their grade. Projects succeed better when you imagine how they might fail first, allowing students to work backward and solve these problems long before Mollick sees their work.

As for the third teaching adjustment—the biggest—it involves flipping all classrooms.

"Lectures do not make as much sense when I've got tools like ChatGPT that can do truly amazing training, all remotely," he says.

I know a thing or two about the flipped classroom. In my 2011 TED Talk, I mentioned how, even then, teachers around the world were emailing me, telling me that because of the existence of Khan Academy videos, they did not feel that lectures were a good use of class time anymore. If kids could get microlessons in the form of on-demand video, at their own time and pace, class time could be used for Socratic dialogue, collaborative assignments, and supported student work. Essentially, lectures were now happening at home, and "homework" could now happen in a much more interactive classroom environment.

"A lot of stuff just got blown up by ChatGPT, and some of that was good stuff," Mollick tells me. "There are ways we have taught students for two thousand years that made a lot of sense. We have gotten good at lectures, and we have gotten good at giving essays and assignments to do at home. The thing to remember," he says, "is that generative AI also makes a teacher's life easier."

Let's explore how.

Dawn of the AI Teaching Assistant

We have a crisis in teaching. Alongside emergency response workers, police officers, and air traffic controllers, teachers have one of the highest rates of professional exhaustion. As a result, the United States is currently facing a massive teacher shortage. We're talking about a deficit of three hundred thousand teachers, with almost 90 percent of school districts across the country reporting teacher shortages year after year. One of the primary reasons behind this shortage is the lack of support and resources for educators. It probably comes as no surprise that our demands on teachers are huge. Overworked and overstretched, their emotional and mental exhaustion is untenable, with the average teacher working fifty-four hours a week—and as little as 49 percent of that time is spent interacting with students, according to a 2022 study by the EdWeek Research Center. Even after the classroom empties, teachers continue to work late into the night, preparing lesson plans and grading papers. It is no wonder that disillusionment sets in quickly. In the United States, the average teacher turnover rate is only five years, and a quarter of all teachers are thinking about leaving the profession.

Having integrated AI teaching assistants into our platform, our team has learned that large language models can actually make teaching a more sustainable profession. Imagine the local school district suddenly discovering hundreds of millions of dollars and using it to offer every teacher the support of three bright assistants for their classrooms. These assistants would help create lesson plans and rubrics, grade papers, write progress reports, riff with teachers, and support their students. Every teacher on the planet would jump at this opportunity. These assistants do not threaten teaching jobs, but they would actually make teaching jobs sustainable. They would make the work more joyous. Most important, they'd help accelerate learning outcomes for millions of students, making them more prepared for college, careers, and life.

Unfortunately, society does not have the resources to give every teacher three human assistants. The good news, however, is that we are now able to offer educators the AI equivalent. In some ways, this will be even more powerful than what human teaching assistants can do. These AI assistants are available around the clock and work one-on-one with every student in the classroom. They can also proactively engage students and hold them softly accountable. Even more, they can do all the grunt work involved in teaching—writing rubrics, giving students feedback on their essays, and drafting student narrative progress reports for parents.

Generative AI can provide educators with new best practices, teaching techniques, and insights into their students' learning gaps. It's not difficult for the AI teaching assistant to identify a problem area for a group of students and offer corresponding lesson plans for the teacher to use, or for the AI teaching assistant to monitor a student's performance in class and send real-time progress updates to teachers. It even has the capacity to act as a counselor for teachers struggling with burnout. These functions are becoming more common and, with the proper guardrails, can be quite powerful.

For decades, future teachers have been taught that one of the best practices in education is differentiation and active learning. Differentiation is the idea that different students need different things. When Seldon and I talk about personalization, this is what we are referring to. Active learning is the notion that students don't learn best when sitting passively, pretending to pay attention to a lecture, but instead do so when they are actively engaged in discussion, games, projects, and problem-solving. Many new teachers aspire to this but quickly discover that these ideals are difficult to meet in a thirty-person class. The few teachers who can pull this off do so by spending countless hours tweaking lesson plans and creating personalized problem sets. Generative AI tutors support students by answering nuanced questions more fully. At the same time, perhaps the biggest game changer from the teacher perspective is that AI can now help craft lesson plans in minutes.

By freeing educators from the administrative work that so often mires their days, artificial intelligence unlocks time and the resources for teachers. A teacher can go to Khanmigo and type the prompt "Create a ninth-grade lesson plan for teaching World War II." Within seconds, it creates a classroom objective and a six-period lesson plan that includes discussions of major events and battles, an introduction to significant figures who played pivotal roles during World War II, and their ideologies, strategies, and contributions to the war effort, while examining their repercussions and legacies.

From there, a teacher could add to the rough draft of the lesson plan or ask the AI to make the lesson plan more exciting by requesting it to begin the class with a quick poll:

AI TEACHING ASSISTANT: Of course! A quick poll is a great way to engage your students and assess their prior knowledge. Here's a suggestion for a poll question: What do you think was the most significant cause of World War II?

Treaty of Versailles

Rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party

Expansionist policies of Axis Powers

Failure of the League of Nations

If a novice teacher needs some additional information or context, all it takes is a simple new prompt: "Can you write a script for me for the section on historic repercussions of the Treaty of Versailles after World War I?" Moments later, the platform replies with a script. It even provides the teacher with tips to make the lesson more interactive for the students, such as adding more details, examples, and anecdotes.

Let's say the hometown team just won the World Series and that's all the students can think about that day. One prompt from the teacher to Khanmigo—"Can you make this lesson plan related to baseball?"—and the bot will produce in seconds what might take a teacher many hours to create. Khanmigo replies, "Certainly! Here's an updated version of the ninth-grade lesson plan on World War II that incorporates baseball!" The new objective includes exploring the role of baseball during the war. The new lesson plan includes introducing the concept of morale and the role of sports during the war, and discussions about how baseball was affected and the formation of military baseball leagues. It suggests articles that explore the experiences of baseball players who served in the military, such as Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. It also recommends learning about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League portrayed in the Geena Davis movie A League of Their Own .

Perhaps a teacher needs a tangible example to help explain the complexity of the economics that led to World War II. Either the teacher can spend an hour or two looking it up in the library or online or they can simply ask the AI teaching assistant for help. Within seconds of receiving a prompt, Khanmigo responds, "Here's a tangible example using a baseball analogy."

AI TEACHING ASSISTANT: Try this! Imagine a scenario where two baseball teams, Team A and Team B, are competing against each other. Both teams rely on equipment and resources to play the game effectively. Team A produces high-quality baseball bats, while Team B specializes in manufacturing baseball gloves. Before the game, the teams engage in trade to exchange bats and gloves, ensuring that each team has the necessary equipment. However, at some point, Team A decides to impose heavy tariffs on the gloves imported from Team B. This means that Team B's gloves become much more expensive for Team A to purchase. As a result, Team B's economy suffers.

By using this baseball analogy, a teacher can now easily illustrate how trade imbalances, protectionist policies, and economic conflicts disrupted relations between nations, ultimately leading to more significant geopolitical conflicts, much like the complex economics that contributed to World War II.

With each back-and-forth with the AI, the stronger and more precise the lesson becomes. A teacher can push the AI further still and ask it to help come up with a creative student project based on the lesson. The AI teaching assistant replies, "Here are some ideas: Create or find an interactive timeline that highlights key events, leaders, and battles of the war. This will give students a visual representation of the chronology and the global impact of the conflict. Or provide students with primary source materials like speeches, letters, and photographs to analyze and interpret. This will help them develop critical thinking skills and gain a deeper understanding of the historical context."

The benefits for teachers go beyond the planning and administrative work of writing, creating, and crafting lessons; grading papers; and communicating with parents. AIs will be able to eventually facilitate classroom breakouts between students, give teachers real-time help and feedback on ways to better engage students, and let teachers know which students likely need their attention the most.

Seldon had us thinking that robots might take over teaching, but the reality is far cooler than the stuff of science fiction. The future of AI in education is about teaming up with technology to make education even better. In other words, AI is not here to steal the show from teachers; it's here to help teachers steal the show. It's the trusty wingman that tackles the boring stuff, sparks creativity, supercharges lessons, and helps educators craft unforgettable learning experiences that light up students' minds.

Done well, not only will this make students' experiences great, but it will bring back joy to so many of those in the teaching profession. I'm not claiming that technology will solve recruitment and burnout issues on its own. There are many other issues that need to be considered, including teacher pay. But we have an obligation to pursue anything that makes teachers' lives easier.

At the end of the day, we find that what really matters to students is not technology so much as having human-to-human connection in the classroom. Remove the teacher and you remove the critical element foundational to all learning. Unlike Seldon's prediction, teachers will always be in command of their classes, and thank goodness for that.

Helping Build Alternative Education Models

Today, roughly three million parents are homeschooling their kids in the United States, and the number is only rising. People homeschool for different reasons, but often they feel that traditional school models don't adequately meet their child's individual needs and interests. It might be fear that fixed-pace instruction will leave their child with more and more gaps that get harder to fix and can undermine a student's confidence. It could be that their child is ready to accelerate or go much deeper than traditional schools may allow.

Still, homeschooling comes with its own set of concerns. Will the child have opportunities for socialization with young people their own age? Do the parents have enough subject matter expertise to support their children in a broad range of subjects? Do the parents have the time, flexibility, and financial resources to properly support their children's learning and development? How does a homeschooled student prove to colleges that they have mastery of material (especially when their parents are doing a lot of the grading)?

Even before considering AI, we and others have been creating comprehensive courses that students can work through in their own time and at their own pace in nearly all core academic subjects, from pre-K through college. These platforms have teacher and parent tools to monitor student progress and make assignments. Parents and teachers can also use these platforms to refresh their own knowledge. The most efficacious platforms are also transparent and free.

New modalities are starting to come online for human-to-human support. For example, Schoolhouse.world provides free, live, small-group tutoring. Not only does that supply rich academic support, it allows young people from all over the world to safely learn alongside one another over Zoom, which provides some socialization. Many of the best Schoolhouse.world volunteer tutors are, in fact, high school students, so it even provides an outlet for service and leadership beyond the walls of the home school.

Students in nontraditional academic environments can leverage these platforms for credit and college admissions. The University of Chicago, MIT, CalTech, Brown, Yale, Georgia Tech, Ohio State, USC, Columbia, and many other universities already consider Schoolhouse.world transcripts for admissions. These transcripts show a mastery of topics based on peer-reviewed recordings of the student getting over 90 percent correct on Khan Academy assessments. They also showcase the quantity and quality of help the student has provided to others on the platform. CalTech, in fact, accepts this transcript to meet its high school course requirements. In other words, if you master all the required subjects on Khan Academy and prove it for the Schoolhouse.world transcript, CalTech will consider you even if you never took those courses from a traditional school.

Even though platforms such as these were not purpose-built for homeschoolers, they have increasingly become go-to resources for that community. They save homeschoolers countless hours (and dollars) that would have otherwise been used to kludge together coursework, support their students in a personalized way, and then prove to colleges that the students have actually learned the material.

Generative AI can now take this to another level. Like students in more traditional schools, homeschooled students can leverage AI tutors like Khanmigo to unblock them academically. They can also use the AI to engage in a debate or simulation. Rather than facilitate cheating, the AI can give real-time feedback and support on how to write better. The AI can act as a coach or guidance counselor to help the student navigate college admissions and career choices that their parents might not have expertise in. Homeschooled students arguably have more time and flexibility to pursue their unique passions. Now they can work with generative AI to create music, movies, and games that a decade ago would cost thousands (or millions) of dollars to produce.

This technology can also help parents. The AI can report back to them exactly what their children have been up to and where they need more support. It can act as a coach or tutor to the parents themselves as they try to refresh their own knowledge or problem-solve how to support their children better.

And all of this isn't just for homeschoolers. Anyone looking for academic alternatives can view these kinds of platforms as building blocks without having to reinvent everything from scratch. "Pod schoolers," a group of families pooling resources together to collectively educate their children, can use this. Anyone looking to start a new school no longer has to reinvent all of these courses, tools, and supports. Even traditional schools can use pieces of this à la carte to give families more options and flexibility.

Just as I don't think one-size-fits-all is great for setting the pace in an academic environment, I also don't think that one type of schooling is better or worse for all families. There are many students who thrive in traditional schools. There are families who value the flexibility and independence of homeschooling. A lot of people exist in between. Until recently, however, many families felt limited in their options for lack of time, money, or know-how. The world of online platforms and generative AI is going to help break down some of these barriers and give more folks the agency to find options that work for them.

Fixing Cheating in College

Every dynamic that makes AI challenging and transformative in secondary education becomes more pronounced in higher education, where students are given more independence. Writing term papers, for instance, can be part of a rigorous high school experience, but in some liberal arts college programs, papers make up the bulk of what a student does in their four years. If ChatGPT-generated writing is a problem in high school, it is an even bigger problem in college. This issue isn't limited to humanities classes but a pplies to any course in which colleges expect students to design or produce original work.

One solution is for universities to simply trust students. Honor codes have been in place for decades at many institutions. Under these policies, students are left to do assignments on their own, from writing papers to taking tests in dorm rooms. At Stanford, for example, until recently professors weren't allowed to proctor in-class exams even if they wanted to.

Unfortunately, by most accounts, honor codes can actually create dishonorable environments where those who play by the rules feel that they are at a clear disadvantage to those who cheat, oftentimes openly. Worse, honor codes put the burden on students to police one another, even though social pressures make it unlikely that they will report on their fellow classmates. And when students do report cheating, it often becomes one person's word against another's.

Students are more comfortable cheating in college than you might expect. According to a 2021 Inside Higher Ed Student Voice survey, 47 percent of respondents found it "somewhat or very acceptable" to use "websites to find answers to test or homework questions." Another Inside Higher Ed report quotes a fourth-year Stanford graduate student saying that cheating has become "part of the fabric of the university . . . no one respects the honor code in its current form—not graduate students, not faculty, not undergraduates."

While I can understand why students might want to seek out help with homework, the pervasiveness of students thinking it's acceptable to get answers for test questions shows an incredible breakdown in academic integrity. Add to this mix the sudden ubiquity of AI tools and a bad situation becomes even worse.

Stanford is not an anomaly here. According to a 2023 survey at Middlebury College, nearly two-thirds of students responded that they have broken the school's honor code, while 32 percent say they have cheated on a test, and 15 percent say that they had "unauthorized use of AI tools/ChatGPT."

These trends are why, in the 2023–2024 school year, Stanford reversed its policy on proctoring, so that professors are now allowed to be in the room when students take an exam. According to Debra Satz, the dean of the School of Humanities and Science, "The undergrads have themselves also pulled out of the contract by the lack of taking responsibility. I don't blame them . . . I think we're seeing an unraveling of a culture where students who don't want to cheat are in an environment where they feel like everybody else is cheating."

Of course, cheating impacted college essays and term papers long before the existence of ChatGPT. In 2019—more than three years before ChatGPT was publicly released— The New York Times profiled college graduates in places like Nigeria and Kenya making a living writing essays for college students in America and other wealthy countries. They are given this work through online intermediaries, and even a quick web search for "write my research paper for me cheaply" shows how ubiquitous these services remain today.

In other words, generative AI is putting a spotlight on an issue that has existed for years. Colleges have either been blissfully ignorant of the situation or just haven't known what to do about it. Regardless, this is a problem that needs to be addressed, otherwise it will undermine the value of a college degree and perpetuate rewarding young people with integrity problems. We know that today's low-integrity college students are tomorrow's low-integrity leaders in business and government.

The good news is that there are solutions. For example, having students work on their writing and papers in class allows them to get support from both the professor and other students. It makes class time more active. Longer essays can be done over multiple class periods. Indeed, this is a variation on the flipped classroom that we have advocated for in math and science; students should do what used to be homework in class and watch recorded lectures on their own time.

Of course, there are important benefits to having students write essays independently, such as developing their ability to plan and not procrastinate, both of which are skills arguably as useful as learning to write. To address this, some professors have attempted to police cheating by having students show more of their process along the way, from outline to first draft to final paper. Unfortunately, it isn't hard to outsource an outline or a first draft to an overseas writer for nine dollars a page or to ChatGPT.

But what if we could go one step further and have the AI actually support the student while making the process transparent to the professor? In Khanmigo, we are developing the ability for a professor to create both an assignment and a grading rubric with the AI and then prompt students to complete tasks through the application. The professor can decide how much support the AI should provide. This could entail basic proctoring in which the application takes periodic snapshots of the paper as the student is writing it, or it could act like a full-fledged writing coach, riffing with the student on possible thesis topics, giving them feedback on their outline, and then providing initial feedback on the essay. This feedback could look at everything from grammar to vetting the quality of the references to estimating what grade the student will likely receive. Then, when the student is ready to submit the essay, the AI could send a report to the professor:

KHANMIGO: Sal and I worked on the essay for about five hours total. He had a little trouble deciding on a thesis statement, but I helped nudge him to pick one. I gave some light feedback on the outline, asking him to make his argument on states' rights stronger. I also think the reference he initially chose for that argument was the most legitimate one. Based on the rubric we created, I'd give the paper a B+ in its current form. If you agree with that assessment, I can work with him to improve it further. Click on the following link to view the entire transcript of our interaction. Overall, I am confident that he did this paper with me and didn't cheat. Not only did the interaction seem authentic, but Sal's writing style and level seemed consistent with the writing that he has been doing inside the classroom.

If the student completed the assignment using an essay-writing farm or ChatGPT and copied and pasted it into the assignment, Khanmigo could report it to the professor:

KHANMIGO: We worked together on this paper for five minutes. For the most part, the paper just seemed to be prewritten somewhere else and pasted in. The writing level is also significantly more advanced than what Sal has done in his classwork. It is very possible that Sal used inappropriate help in creating it. Click on the following link to view the entire transcript of our interaction.

This type of transparency addresses many issues at once. It focuses on the process, helping the student while mitigating cheating. And even if a student enlists a friend (or AI) to try to engage with Khanmigo on their behalf, the final product would likely be inconsistent with the student's in-class, proctored writing samples. Teachers will receive a preliminary assessment, cutting down grading time, which allows them to devote more energy for themselves and their students. Last, but not least, students will get much more timely feedback and support to improve their writing.

Dwelling a bit on the value of providing rapid feedback, it would be very hard to get better at basketball free throws if you didn't know whether or not you made the basket for several days or weeks. As ridiculous as this sounds, this is exactly what happens with writing practice. Before generative AI came on the scene, it could take days or weeks before students got feedback on their papers. By that point, they may have forgotten much of what they had written, and there wouldn't be a chance for them to refine their work. Contrast this to the vision in which students receive immediate feedback on every dimension of their writing from the AI. They will have the chance to practice, iterate, and improve much faster.

This applies to any type of independent student work, not just writing. We can see that, done well, generative AI can not only address long-standing issues with cheating, but it can bring about a richer and more productive learning experience for students. Best of all, by thoughtfully embracing the technology, colleges will better prepare their students for the world that they will be graduating into.
