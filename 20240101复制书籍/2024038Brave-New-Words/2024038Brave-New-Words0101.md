## 0101. Rise of the AI Tutor

A great teacher can teach calculus with a paper clip and literature in an empty field. Technology is just another tool, not a destination.

— Unknown

In your Primer you have a resource that will make you highly educated, but it will never make you intelligent. That comes from life. Your life up to this point has given you all the experience you need to be intelligent, but you have to think about those experiences. If you don't think about them, you'll be psychologically unwell. If you do think about them, you will become not merely educated but intelligent.

— Neal Stephenson, The Diamond Age

第一部分：AI 教师的崛起

一位优秀的老师可以用一根回形针教微积分，也可以在空地上教授文学。技术只是工具，而不是最终目标。

—— 未知

在你的入门手册里，有一种资源可以让你获得高等教育，但它无法让你变得聪明。聪明是从生活中得来的。到目前为止，你的生活经历已经给了你成为聪明人的所有经验，但你需要反思这些经历。如果不反思，你可能会在心理上出现问题。如果你反思了，不仅会受过教育，还会变得聪明。

—— Neal Stephenson，《钻石时代》

### 1.1 Throwing Away the Bottle

The genie was out of the bottle. As quickly as ChatGPT seemed to spread to all reaches of the globe, the application faced widespread bans and resistance.

OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, had introduced a broad tool that allows for conversations and research assistance on a wide range of topics, but also for what many people consider cheating on student assignments and exams. In early 2023, the Los Angeles Unified School District became the first major school system to ban it. Seattle Public Schools were next, prohibiting generative AI on all campus devices. The district said it did not allow cheating and required original thought and work from students. From there, New York City Public Schools, the largest school district in the country, temporarily banned ChatGPT over the fear that students were using it to write essays and fill in answers to homework for them. Besides, it said, the tool did not help build critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Then Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia banned it, followed by Alabama's Montgomery County.

OpenAI's artificial intelligence chatbot had been released to the public the previous November, and in less than a week it had surpassed one million users. People were using it for things like answering questions, creating code, and writing essays, touting it as the next leap in technological innovation. Two months later, schools everywhere, from France to India to Australia, had outlawed the bot. Some equated the spread of the technology to COVID and pronounced it the death of education for our kids as we knew it. " Today we are facing a new sort of plague, one that threatens our minds more than our bodies. ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chat bot that can write college-level essays, is going viral," said one Inside Higher Ed opinion piece. "To their shock and dismay, [teachers] will find that their classroom has tested positive for GPT."

Frankly, as both a father and an educator, I understood this distrust. The last thing I wanted was for a new technology to come and strip our students of agency, creativity, socialization skills, and collaborative learning opportunities. Student exposure to generative AI is inevitable at this point, so it is natural to worry about the implications it will have on learning and development. Some say kids get enough screen time as it is, and we fear ChatGPT and other AI-based applications will only mean more screen time. We fear large language models will worsen instances of students not doing their own work. We fear that the potential effect on student writing skills will be catastrophic, with generative AI able to generate text quickly and efficiently for them. We fear that because GPT-generated text pulls from millions of online sources full of biased language and viewpoints, the information it lays out in its final form will be biased as well.

These are all reasonable fears. However, I have always said that when it comes to technology and education, it is not that technology is good or bad, it is how you use it that matters. Yes, technology can suck you into unhealthy habits. It can make you pay more attention to notifications on your phone than to the people in the room with you. You can easily lose a few hours to social media, only to feel more insecure or triggered as a result. It is not hard to find very dark and disturbing content if you accidentally type the wrong word into search (and sometimes even the right word). That very same technology, though, also allows you to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether editing video or writing or coding, it can be a boon for your creativity and a powerful means of self-expression. And, closest to my heart, it can be a means to learn and improve yourself. Ideally, we use technology in the education space to enhance social connections, emotional development, and character.

We know that the most recent generation of AI can be incredibly powerful. In medicine, AI can assist in diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical records, and providing personalized treatment recommendations. Businesses are using large language models to streamline content generation and automate work flows. In legal and compliance spheres, large language models assist in contract analysis and legal research, generating documents, and ensuring adherence to regulations. From developing technical documentation, to writing user manuals, to creating grant proposals to coding, employing this technology is far more productive than avoiding it. The meme circulating on the internet that reads "You won't be replaced by an AI, but you might be replaced by someone using AI" has some real truth to it.

The most successful students will be those who use AI to help make conceptual connections for developing ideas. Students who learn to use AI ethically and productively may learn not only at an exponentially higher rate than others but also in a way that allows them to remain competitive throughout their careers. They will have a deeper understanding of the given subject matter, because they will know how to get their questions answered. Rather than atrophying, their curiosity muscle will be strengthened.

All these skills will directly translate into the workplace too. Those who can steer AI to partner with them, and know what great writing entails, will be those who get the best output from the technology. Those who feed their curiosity will be the most likely to see around corners in the marketplace. Those who can brainstorm with the AI and their colleagues will appear more creative than those who don't use AI or those who completely outsource their work to it. Workers will need to learn how to use large language models to automate almost any traditional white-collar process, too, from collating information to doing analysis on spreadsheets.

I am not going to say that there are no issues that come with this new tool. Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president who first demoed GPT-4 to me in the summer of 2022, believes that the challenge of identifying and tackling these issues comes down to putting safety measures in place. "From the start, when OpenAI developed GPT-1, safety was the most important problem to solve. As we push this technology forward, we want it to be beneficial and we want it to be safe," he says. The company has invested significant resources in implementing safeguards to prevent misuse of the tool, from mechanisms that prevent the AI from sharing knowledge about illegal activities, to blocking disallowed content, to personal data safety. When it comes to artificial intelligence and merging it with our kids' education, these types of guardrails are even more important. The work involved can be labor intensive, but the cause is well worth it, he says. "Fundamentally, signing up to make the most important technology that humans will ever create, and applying it to education, is something to get behind."

More significantly, he says, the technology is something not to fear but to use. Engagement with generative AI can potentially benefit students by providing new ways for them to learn the material, enhancing collaborative learning, stoking creativity, promoting socialization, and even helping kids through mental health issues, as well as offering new ways for parents and teachers to engage more thoroughly with their children's education. Rather than pushing our kids to avoid AI, Brockman says, we can help them learn smarter .

The genie is out of the bottle. It is time to throw the bottle away and our fear of generative AI along with it.

放飞瓶中的精灵

瓶中的精灵已经被释放。随着 ChatGPT 迅速传播到全球各地，这个应用也面临着广泛的禁令和抵制。

开发 ChatGPT 的公司 OpenAI 推出了一种广泛的工具，能够在各种主题上进行对话和研究协助，但也被许多人视为学生作业和考试作弊的工具。2023 年初，洛杉矶联合学区成为第一个禁止使用 ChatGPT 的大型学校系统。紧接着是西雅图公立学校，它们禁止在所有校园设备上使用生成式 AI。该学区表示，学校不允许作弊，要求学生进行原创思考和创作。随后，美国最大的学校系统纽约市公立学校也暂时禁止了 ChatGPT，因为担心学生利用它写作文和完成作业。此外，该学区表示，这个工具并没有帮助学生培养批判性思维和解决问题的能力。接着，弗吉尼亚州的费尔法克斯县公立学校和阿拉巴马州的蒙哥马利县也相继禁止了 ChatGPT 的使用。

OpenAI 的人工智能聊天机器人于去年十一月向公众开放，不到一周时间用户数就突破了一百万。人们用它来回答问题、编写代码和撰写文章，称它是技术创新的下一次飞跃。两个月后，从法国到印度再到澳大利亚的学校都禁止了这个机器人。一些人将这种技术的传播比作 COVID，并认为这是我们所知的教育的终结。「今天我们面临一种新的瘟疫，一种比身体疾病更威胁我们心灵的瘟疫。ChatGPT，这个可以写出大学水平论文的人工智能聊天机器人，正在迅速传播，」一篇 Inside Higher Ed 的观点文章写道。「令他们震惊和沮丧的是，老师们会发现他们的课堂已经被 GPT 入侵。」

坦白说，作为一名父亲和教育者，我理解这种不信任。我最担心的是新技术的出现会剥夺学生的自主性、创造力、社交技能和合作学习的机会。学生接触生成式 AI 是不可避免的，因此担心它对学习和发展的影响也是合情合理的。一些人认为孩子们已经有足够的屏幕时间，我们担心 ChatGPT 和其他基于 AI 的应用只会增加这种时间。我们害怕大语言模型会导致学生不做自己的作业。我们还担心生成式 AI 能够快速高效地生成文本，对学生的写作技能会产生灾难性的影响。由于 GPT 生成的文本来源于数百万个充满偏见的在线资源，我们担心它最终呈现的信息也会带有偏见。

这些担忧都是可以理解的。然而，我一直认为，当涉及到技术和教育时，关键不是技术本身的好坏，而在于如何使用它。的确，技术可能会让你养成不健康的习惯，比如更关注手机上的通知而忽视身边的人。你可能会在社交媒体上浪费几个小时，结果反而让自己感到更不安或受到刺激。如果不小心输入了错误的搜索词（有时即使是正确的词），也可能找到非常黑暗和令人不安的内容。然而，同样的技术也能帮助你与朋友和家人保持联系。无论是编辑视频、写作还是编程，技术都可以成为你创意的福音和自我表达的强大工具。对我来说，它最宝贵的是可以用于学习和自我提升。理想情况下，我们在教育领域利用技术来增强社会连接、促进情感发展和培养品格。

我们知道，最新一代的 AI 非常强大。在医学领域，AI 可以帮助诊断疾病、分析医疗记录，并提供个性化的治疗建议。企业正在利用大语言模型来简化内容生成和自动化工作流程。在法律和合规领域，大语言模型帮助进行合同分析和法律研究，生成文件，并确保遵守法规。从编写技术文档、用户手册、创建资助提案到编程，使用这项技术要比避开它更高效。互联网上流传的那句「你不会被 AI 取代，但你可能会被使用 AI 的人取代」确实有一定道理。

最成功的学生将是那些使用 AI 来帮助建立概念联系、发展创意的学生。学会道德且高效地使用 AI 的学生，不仅可以比其他人更快地学习，还能够在整个职业生涯中保持竞争力。他们会对所学科目有更深入的理解，因为他们知道如何找到问题的答案。他们的好奇心不会减弱，反而会增强。

这些技能也会直接应用到工作中。能够引导 AI 与自己合作，并且懂得优秀写作的人，能从技术中获得最佳成果。充满好奇心的人最有可能在市场中发现新的机会。那些能与 AI 和同事一起头脑风暴的人，会显得比不使用 AI 或完全依赖 AI 的人更有创造力。员工还需要学习如何使用大语言模型来自动化几乎所有传统的白领工作流程，从信息汇总到在电子表格上进行分析。

我并不是说这种新工具没有问题。OpenAI 的总裁 Greg Brockman 在 2022 年夏天首次向我演示 GPT-4 时表示，识别和解决这些问题的关键在于采取安全措施。「从开发 GPT-1 开始，安全始终是最重要的问题。随着我们推进这项技术，我们希望它既有益又安全，」他说。公司投入了大量资源来防止工具被滥用，包括阻止 AI 分享非法活动信息、屏蔽不允许的内容以及保护个人数据安全。当涉及将人工智能与孩子的教育结合时，这些保护措施尤为重要。他说，这项工作可能很费力，但非常值得。「从根本上来说，致力于开发人类有史以来最重要的技术并将其应用于教育，是值得支持的。」

更重要的是，他说，这项技术不是要害怕的，而是要利用的。与生成式 AI（Generative AI）的互动可以为学生提供新的学习方式，增强协作学习，激发创造力，促进社交，甚至帮助孩子们解决心理健康问题，同时也为家长和老师提供更多与孩子教育深入互动的新途径。Brockman 说，我们应帮助孩子们更聪明地学习，而不是避开 AI。

精灵已经出瓶。是时候把瓶子和对生成式 AI 的恐惧一起抛开了。

### 1.2 How to Teach Everything to Everyone

When a hot new technology like GPT-4 comes out, it is important to not use it simply because it is "cool." We have to think about what important problems this technology might be able to help solve. Could it help close learning gaps or provide access to quality education regardless of geographic constraints, economic limitations, or social circumstances? Could it help meet the diverse needs and learning styles of each student where they are instead of the typical one-size-fits-all approach? Could it help address the limited availability of high-quality resources in education systems globally, especially in underserved or remote areas, or help with problems of student retention of learned material? Could it help save teachers time and support them better, preventing overwork and attrition in the process?

What might it be like if every student on the planet had access to an artificially intelligent personal tutor: an AI capable of writing alongside the student; an AI that students could debate any topic with; an AI that fine-tuned a student's inherent strengths and augmented any gaps in learning; an AI that engaged students in new and powerful ways of understanding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; an AI that gave students new ways of experiencing art and unlocking their own creativity; an AI that allowed for students to engage with history and literature like never before?

The ideas that emerged from the hack-AI-thon became the starting point for an evolution in our thinking of what is possible in education. Our user research teams, product designers, and engineers set out to design a new kind of AI tutor, powered by GPT technology, that works alongside learners as they practice concepts in every subject, along with an AI assistant for teachers too.

In late 2022 and early 2023, Khan Academy began planning to be the first education platform to incorporate GPT-4 in advance of its launch. But more important than getting to market first, we wanted to ensure that the experience was magical, effective, and safe. To do so, we needed to get to know the technology by better understanding its capabilities and its limits. It was pretty clear that stand-alone GPT-4 was really good at answering questions, albeit with a smattering of factual and math errors (although far fewer errors than GPT 3.5, which powered the initial ChatGPT). We pushed its boundaries, tried to break it, and spent countless hours attempting to fix it through better prompts and infrastructure, including anchoring it on content from Khan Academy. For our primary student use case of becoming a tutor, answering questions wasn't sufficient. What we needed to do was invert the interaction so that it was asking questions of us, like a good tutor. We spent hours iterating prompts, asking the AI to act as a Socratic tutor to nudge students forward with leading questions but not give away the answer. This is not an easy needle to thread, even for human tutors.

One of the noteworthy properties of GPT-4 is its "steerability," especially compared with GPT-3.5 and other earlier large language models. This is the ability for us to modulate the technology to do what we want it to do. For example, we tried to prompt GPT-3.5 to act like a tutor. But no matter how much we told it to not give answers, it often did, and not always correct ones. GPT-4, on the other hand, was able to take on roles or personas fairly well, even through simple prompting like "You will be a Socratic tutor. I will be your student. Don't give me answers."

That gave us the initial confidence that it could have the power to emulate a tutor. Of course, there is a big difference between something that can kind of behave like a tutor after giving it three sentences' worth of prompts and something that you could put in front of millions of learners. We diligently tweaked prompts to anticipate the edge cases that an AI tutor would likely encounter at scale, especially when dealing with mischievous middle school students. We needed to ensure that it wouldn't engage in inappropriate conversations, and we developed a distinct tone and voice for the platform. We were on a tight deadline. OpenAI wanted to launch GPT-4 in March 2023, and Khan Academy's goal was to launch our AI tutor and teaching assistant the same day to show the socially positive power of the technology. More important than the deadline, it was paramount that we felt we were offering something that was substantive, thoughtful, engaging, and safe.

On March 15, 2023, when we launched our AI assistant, by this point called Khanmigo—a play on the Spanish phrase conmigo , meaning "with me"—we introduced learners, parents, and teachers the world over to the artificial intelligence assistant now integrated into everything that Khan Academy does. The platform offers every person an opportunity to engage deeply in the education process in entirely new ways. Among other things, it provides a personalized and patient tutor that focuses on the learner's interests or struggles and empowers educators to better understand how they can fully support their students.

As powerful as I believe the initial launch was, we were only just beginning to scratch the surface. Not only could the platform serve as a tutor, but it could also emulate literary and historical figures. It could engage students in debate. It could act as a guidance counselor and career coach. With the power of memory, it could have long-lasting connections with learners, not just supporting them academically, but also checking in with them, helping them set goals, and then gently holding them accountable to meet those goals. It could potentially facilitate interactions among multiple students as well. In the near future, we could have AI practice and assessments based on simulations driven by Khanmigo. Every hour we brainstormed, we realized the technology could enhance and enrich every learning domain—including writing, comprehension, math, science, coding, and art—in ways no other tool can or does.

如何教所有人所有事

当 GPT-4 这样的新兴技术出现时，重要的是不要仅仅因为它「酷」而使用它。我们必须考虑这项技术可能解决哪些重要问题。它能否弥合学习差距，提供优质教育，无论地理位置、经济条件或社会环境如何？它能否满足每个学生的多样化需求和学习方式，而不是采用典型的「一刀切」方法？它能否解决全球教育系统中高质量资源有限的问题，尤其是在服务不足或偏远地区，或者帮助解决学生对已学材料的保留问题？它能否节省教师的时间，更好地支持他们，防止过度工作和流失？

如果每个学生都能拥有一个人工智能私人导师会怎样：一个可以与学生共同写作的 AI；一个学生可以与之辩论任何话题的 AI；一个能优化学生优势并弥补学习差距的 AI；一个以全新而强大的方式吸引学生理解科学、技术、工程和数学的 AI；一个为学生提供全新体验艺术和释放创造力方式的 AI；一个让学生以前所未有的方式参与历史和文学的 AI？

黑客马拉松中涌现的想法成为我们重新思考教育可能性的起点。我们的用户研究团队、产品设计师和工程师开始设计一种由 GPT 技术驱动的新型 AI 导师，它不仅在各个学科中与学习者一起练习概念，还能为教师提供一个 AI 助手。

在 2022 年底至 2023 年初，Khan Academy 开始计划成为第一个整合 GPT-4 的教育平台。但比抢先推出更重要的是，我们希望确保体验既奇妙又有效且安全。为此，我们需要深入了解这项技术的能力和局限性。显然，独立的 GPT-4 在回答问题方面表现非常出色，虽然偶尔会出现一些事实和数学错误（但比驱动初版 ChatGPT 的 GPT-3.5 错误少得多）。我们不断挑战其极限，尝试找出问题，并花费大量时间通过更好的提示和基础设施来修复，包括将其内容锚定在 Khan Academy 上。对于我们的主要学生使用场景 —— 成为一名导师，单纯回答问题是不够的。我们需要反转这种互动方式，让它像一个优秀的导师一样向我们提问。我们花了很多时间迭代提示，要求 AI 充当苏格拉底式的导师，通过引导性问题推动学生思考，而不直接给出答案。即使是人类导师，这也是一个很难掌握的技巧。

GPT-4 的一个显著特性是其「可引导性」，尤其是与 GPT-3.5 和其他早期的大语言模型相比。这意味着我们可以调控这项技术来实现我们的需求。例如，我们曾试图提示 GPT-3.5 扮演导师角色，但无论我们如何强调不让它给出答案，它经常还是会给出答案，而且并不总是正确的。而 GPT-4 则能通过简单的提示，如「你将是一个苏格拉底式的导师。我将是你的学生。不要给我答案。」来很好地扮演不同角色。

这让我们初步相信，它可能具备模拟导师的能力。当然，能够在短短三句话的提示后表现得像导师，和能够面对成千上万学习者的实际使用是有很大区别的。我们仔细调整了提示词，以预见 AI 导师在大规模应用时可能遇到的各种极端情况，尤其是面对淘气的中学生时。我们需要确保它不会参与不适当的对话，同时为平台开发了独特的语气和风格。时间非常紧迫。OpenAI 希望在 2023 年 3 月推出 GPT-4，而 Khan Academy 的目标是在同一天推出我们的 AI 导师和教学助手，以展示这项技术的社会积极影响。比起截止日期，更重要的是我们要确保提供的服务是有深度、周到、有吸引力且安全的。

在 2023 年 3 月 15 日，我们推出了名为 Khanmigo 的 AI 助手，这个名字取自西班牙语短语 conmigo，意思是「和我一起」。我们向全球的学习者、家长和教师介绍了这个整合到 Khan Academy 各项功能中的人工智能助手。这个平台为每个人提供了全新方式深入参与教育过程的机会。它不仅是一个个性化且耐心的导师，专注于学习者的兴趣和困难，还能帮助教育者更好地理解如何全面支持他们的学生。

尽管我认为初次发布已经非常强大，但我们只是刚刚开始探索其潜力。这个平台不仅可以作为导师，还可以模拟文学和历史人物，与学生进行辩论，充当指导顾问和职业教练。它可以利用记忆功能与学习者建立持久的联系，不仅在学术上支持他们，还能定期检查他们的进展，帮助设定目标，并温和地督促他们实现目标。它还可以促进多名学生之间的互动。在不久的将来，我们可能会有由 Khanmigo 驱动的模拟练习和评估。每当我们进行头脑风暴时，我们都意识到，这项技术可以以其他工具无法做到的方式增强和丰富包括写作、理解、数学、科学、编码和艺术在内的各个学习领域。

### 1.3 Rise of the AI Tutor

Educators have known for millennia that one-on-one instruction—tutoring that works with students at their own time and pace—is the best way for people to learn. It is what Alexander the Great had with his teacher, Aristotle. If Alexander was having trouble with a concept, I can imagine Aristotle slowing down for him. If Alexander had a knack for understanding military tactics, I am sure Aristotle would have sped up his instruction or gone deeper. By having this one-on-one attention, the student never feels stuck or bored. This isn't just something that happened in the deep past. Today, top athletes and musicians, for instance, continue to learn through one-on-one coaching. However, without the support of teaching assistants or technology, it's hard to imagine an individual teacher getting anywhere near this level of growth with a single coach and thirty students all at the same time.

In the eighteenth century, we began to have the utopian idea of offering mass public education to everyone. We didn't have the resources to give every student a personal tutor, so instead we batched them together in groups of thirty or so, and we applied standardized processes to them, usually in the form of lectures and periodic assessments. While not perfect, that system dramatically improved the overall level of education in the societies that invested in it, increasing literacy rates globally and education rates overall. Still, the approach isn't optimal for the majority of students. For instance, traditional fixed-pace classes force students to move on to a more advanced topic even if they haven't really mastered more basic ones. This forms gaps in their knowledge that accumulate over time. Today, we see the implications of these gaps in every classroom and across every learning domain. In the United States, a majority of students, even the ones who graduate from high school and then decide to go to college, do not even place into college-level math. Most, in fact, are told at age eighteen or nineteen by their colleges that they have too many gaps even for algebra and, because of this, need to take non-credit-bearing remedial courses in middle-school-level pre-algebra. Three-quarters of graduating high school seniors lack basic proficiency in writing too.

In 1984, the renowned education psychologist Benjamin Bloom attempted to quantify the effect of being able to break out of this factory model of education through better personalization and one-on-one tutoring. As a researcher at the University of Chicago, Bloom compared the outcomes of conventional learning with those of students who studied with a good tutor. What, exactly, was a good tutor? A caring and student-attuned instructor who presented clear learning objectives, assessments, and specialized feedback until, eventually, that student demonstrated a real grasp of the material.

This was closely tied to the notion of mastery learning, which entails always giving students the opportunity and incentive to address any gaps in their knowledge or skills. In conventional learning—still the norm in most schools—teachers educate students at a fixed pace and give them a quiz or test every few weeks. Even if students get 80 percent on a test, the class typically moves in lockstep to the next topic, usually without first addressing the 20 percent gap that was identified on the last exam. This process continues for years, with the students accumulating gaps along the way, and then we act surprised when they have trouble with algebra or calculus. No matter how innately bright or hardworking someone is, how can they have a chance of mastering algebra if they have major gaps in, say, decimals, fractions, or exponents? In mastery learning, students have time to identify and address those gaps. Having the space to develop a strong foundation allows the student to learn faster later too. In fairness to the traditional school system, without support, it is difficult to pull this off with one teacher and thirty students, each with different gaps and learning paces.

The resulting paper on what Bloom described as the two-sigma problem framed the benefits of one-on-one tutoring in a mastery learning context. In this paper, Bloom wrote that if a student works with a tutor to master a topic or skill, the student would gain a two-standard-deviation improvement—a massive upgrade that takes someone from the 50th percentile to roughly the 96th percentile.

He framed this as a "problem," however, because existing education systems were unable to realistically scale group instruction this way, leaving the two-standard-deviation increase out of reach for most students. Middle-class or affluent families have traditionally addressed this problem by providing their kids with some form of personalized tutoring.

For many years, I've talked about the necessity for schools to provide equal access to this level of personalization, regardless of socioeconomic status. We've always had the aspiration at Khan Academy that over time we might become that tutor for everyone. And when I say tutor, I am talking about the kind of tutor Aristotle was to Alexander the Great. That is, not just someone who helps you with your homework or pushes you a little, although both of those things are valuable. The kind of tutoring experience I want to create is one in which a student can build trust and form a relationship with a tutor who has an intimate sense of what they know and what they don't know. Our tutor would understand what motivates a student and use that to really fine-tune their education. Even more, a tutor would utilize what they know about the student to support teachers and parents. The best tutors make learning truly student-centered, both through direct interactions with the learner and by helping educators drive more personalization themselves.

Our platform was able to approximate that experience in various ways with tools like on-demand video and personalized exercises that allowed students to work through concepts at their own time and pace, receive immediate feedback, and close their learning gaps. All of this has been coupled with teacher and administrator dashboards so that educators can understand where their students stand and what supports they can provide to optimize learning and engagement. In those pre-AI years, we tried to provide educators with a technology-based path from traditional, fixed-pace, non-mastery methods toward more personalized pacing and mastery. We got pretty far too. More than fifty efficacy studies on our work have shown that students who put in thirty to sixty minutes a week of personalized practice on learning experienced 20−60 percent acceleration. In settings like Khan Lab School and Khan World School, which both focus on mastery learning, we are seeing students gain one and a half to three years of learning in math per year.

Yet, as fundamental a shift in learning as "traditional" Khan Academy can be, the platform has remained somewhat limited in how far it could go. If a student wanted to go beyond the videos and exercises, they had limited options. They couldn't ask follow-up questions to better understand the concept or how it relates to their lives. Our assessments have been limited to numeric entry, equation entry, and multiple choice, even though certain topics could really benefit from more open-ended responses. In theory, we can, and did, put some basic goal-setting and goal-tracking features on the site, but it still didn't feel like a check-in with a caring tutor.

Then came GPT-4.

It quickly became clear to me that this technology could potentially allow us to address all these deficiencies. And, luckily, I wasn't alone. Nearly every one of our team members saw the potential when they got access to GPT-4. But the more we played with it, the more we realized that as powerful as GPT-4 is, it still needed thoughtfully engineered guardrails and supports to be truly effective.

This type of collaborative engagement was one of the reasons why the OpenAI leadership reached out to us as a potential partner in the first place. Now Greg Brockman believes the latest generation of large language models has the potential to be the biggest benefit to education we've had in history. "GPT brought together people from research and engineering backgrounds to create a massive endeavor of humanity designed to have maximum impact here," he says. To his mind, one of the best ways to do so was building an AI system capable of providing every learner on earth with a personal tutor. Not just any tutor, but a kind of "super" tutor, one that in theory was capable of providing that two-standard-deviation bump.

I've learned in life that potentially world-changing opportunities don't show up every day, but when you find yourself in a position to use one, you should try like hell to do so. With such advances in generative AI, it felt to me that we were tantalizingly close to that holy grail of education—an AI that, with proper guardrails and interfaces, could make the learning experience significantly more effective for millions of learners.

Several months after previewing GPT-4, Khan Academy decided to fully invest in the technology. Our goal with Khanmigo was that by adding generative AI to our existing learning process, we could potentially address Bloom's two-sigma problem and then eventually scale it to every classroom, teacher, and student on the planet.

We launched Khanmigo alongside GPT-4, unsure how the world was going to react to it. ChatGPT initially had a negative reaction from educators, primarily because of its ability to enable cheating. The hope was that our new platform—which used a more advanced model and had significant functionality to prevent cheating, provide transparency to teachers, and keep student interactions safe and productive—was not going to be thrown into the same bucket.

Luckily, by the time we launched, educators were starting to come around and realize that, yes, ChatGPT posed real issues for education but that didn't mean folks should ban the underlying technology. This was especially important because students would likely need to work with this type of technology in their future careers. Besides, teachers themselves were beginning to employ the technology in lesson planning and research. If anything, by March 2023, it seemed that educators craved a tool that used the power of ChatGPT-like technology for education, implemented with learning and teacher support in mind.

When we finally came out publicly with Khanmigo, we got an overwhelming response of support from the education community, including many school districts that had originally banned ChatGPT. They were happy to see an organization incorporate the underlying AI of GPT-4 in a safe, effective, thoughtful, and pedagogically sound way.

In practice, this meant that when students are stuck, say, on a math question, they could simply ask Khanmigo for help by typing into a chat field. But the AI won't simply tell them the answer. Instead, it will walk them through the problem, as a good tutor might do.

STUDENT: I'm having trouble with polynomials. Can you help explain how to find the degree of this polynomial and the leading coefficient in this question? 3X 2 – 5X 2 + 2

KHANMIGO: No problem! Let's break it down. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable (in this case, x) in the polynomial. The leading coefficient is the number in front of the term with the highest degree. Looking at our polynomial, can you identify the term with the highest power of x and the number in front of it?

If the student gets the next step wrong, Khanmigo replies, "Close, but not quite! Remember, we're looking for the highest power of x in the polynomial. Let's try again together."

Khanmigo doesn't just do this with math. It can work with students in any subject, including history, chemistry, physics, and art. Beyond helping students in subject-matter courses, it can motivate learners, quiz them, summarize videos, and adjust in real time to their needs. Throughout, it offers dynamic and specific encouragement to students, building comfort, rapport, and trust. At the same time, the language that the AI tutor uses with the student is natural and personable. If a student is feeling unmotivated by the work at hand, Khanmigo responds with something to the effect of "Hey, you are doing this pretty well. Don't worry if you have trouble doing it at first. It is a little bit more advanced. Why don't we try this new approach?"

Unlike ChatGPT, Khanmigo also remembers previous discussions, meaning that in one conversation you can reference previous sessions you've had with the AI tutor. If, for example, the student learning basic equations in algebra eventually asks Khanmigo, "Why should I care about this?" the AI tutor might reply, "Well, what do you care about?"

STUDENT: Not math! I'd much rather be talking about soccer!

KHANMIGO: Okay! So, let's say you are a soccer coach, and you want to model the number of goals your team scores based on the number of hours they practice each week. You come up with the following polynomial:

3X 2 –5X 2 + 2

Can you identify the degree of this polynomial and the leading coefficient?

Days later, when that same student is working on a history project with Khanmigo and needs help understanding the concept of federalism, the AI tutor will have remembered that the student cares about soccer.

KHANMIGO: Imagine a soccer league. Let's think about different ways to govern it. Does the team govern itself any way it wants to by doing its own thing? Or does a central authority govern the team? Federalism is a system of government where power is divided between a central authority and smaller political units, like states or provinces.

The AI registers whether you like formal language or more colloquial responses; it takes into account whether you prefer short answers or long-form answers; it remembers what motivates you most and uses it to keep you engaged. In other words, the AI is always taking notes on your preferences in a highly transparent way. At any time, you can see what it is learning about you and you can modify it. This memory can also report synopses of your progress back to parents and teachers.

In a lot of ways, Khanmigo's capabilities mimic what I would do to support students at Khan Lab School or with my own children. Before Khanmigo, when my students felt stuck, I would help them think through what the question was asking. Sometimes I would ask follow-up questions. If they'd watched a video or read an article, I would try to test their comprehension. Sometimes I would explain how one thing connected to something else. If they didn't know what to work on next, I would highlight areas for improvement and suggest exercises to strengthen these gaps. The advent of the AI tutor means that it is now possible for every student to get this type of personalization. Khanmigo walks students through the challenging questions and asks the follow-up questions. Today, students can ask Khanmigo what they need to work on, and based on Khanmigo's running memory of their progress, the AI tutor will make suggestions and engage them with conversation, content, quizzes, and tests. The AI tutor meets students right at their learning edge, at their zone of proximal development, at a level that stretches them but isn't too easy, isn't too hard, but is right at that Goldilocks zone. The best part is, the students feel like they were part of the journey.

To get a sense of just how big this paradigm shift is, let's go back to the Turing test. With Khanmigo, I think we have an artificial intelligence that is hard to distinguish from a strong human tutor. Thanks to this generation of large language models, we get to go from having something that's approximating the aspects of a tutor through personalized recommendations, videos, and mastery-based practice (where students have as many shots as they need to show proficiency, given the huge number of possible questions at the system's disposal) to an actual, albeit AI-based, tutor supporting that mastery learning. We go from a world of approximating personalization by offering students the freedom to move forward and backward at their own pace to also supporting students on their journey in a way that a human tutor can. The AI tutor hovers beside our students as they work.

It also teaches them to be better thinkers by engaging them in Socratic questioning throughout the learning process. A reporter was skeptical as to how Khanmigo might handle politically sensitive issues.

"Well, let's try it out together," I suggested. I launched Khanmigo and opened the activity, "Tutor me in humanities."

The reporter suggested that for this experiment we act like a student who is ardently for gun control and thinks that the Second Amendment makes no sense today.

I typed into Khanmigo, "Why do we have the Second Amendment? It seems crazy!"

Khanmigo replied, "Why do you think the Founders included the Second Amendment to begin with?"

Notice it didn't refute or reinforce our imaginary student's stated opinion, but it did challenge them to think deeper about the issue.

I then wrote, "Well, they were trying to exert their independence from England, which didn't want them to be armed. They felt that the right to bear arms and have a militia could ensure that they could preserve their independence. But that was a different time!"

Khanmigo responded, "That's a pretty good explanation. Yes, it was a different time, but why do you think the Second Amendment has persisted for so long?"

It was still pushing the student to think deeper about the issue. By contrast, I suspect it would be difficult for most teachers or tutors to not show their own beliefs and/or project them onto the student in a discussion as charged as one on gun control. The reporter was impressed. Khanmigo was challenging the student in a productive way—one that showed much less bias than the average classroom and actually encouraged the student to think!

After a reading assignment, it might ask a student, "What is your opinion of this essay?" Through thoughtful questioning and dialogue, Khanmigo works alongside a student to dive into a topic and uncover its hidden layers. This allows students to become active participants in their own learning process, with the AI asking probing questions that challenge assumptions, clarify concepts, and encourage deeper exploration. The AI tutor doesn't come off reading or sounding like a machine either. Rather, it feels personable, thoughtful, and empathetic.

Moving forward, I'll be using the example of Khanmigo as a stand-in for education-based AI platforms, a space that continues to expand and grow, and for good reason. While human coaches and tutors will always be in demand, AI raises the floor for students who have very little access to personalized learning or world-class coursework and makes a human tutor's job both easier and more effective. After all, a student might engage a human tutor for a few hours a week, but they have access to Khanmigo 24/7, and Khanmigo can report back to the human tutor what it's been working on with the student to allow the human tutor to go deeper and further. Some students might even feel more comfortable asking certain questions to an AI, because they would have less fear of being judged or wasting the human tutor's precious (or expensive) time.

Supercharged with memory, incredible content knowledge, a remarkably human and naturalistic voice, an ability to create genuine rapport with students, and the growing ubiquity of access through technology from phones to computers, AI tutors might in time even surpass the results of Bloom's original findings.

AI 导师的崛起

几千年来，教育工作者一直知道，一对一的教学 —— 以学生自己的时间和节奏进行的辅导 —— 是最佳的学习方式。亚历山大大帝就是在老师亚里士多德的指导下学习的。如果亚历山大对某个概念有困难，我可以想象亚里士多德会放慢教学速度。如果亚历山大擅长理解军事战术，我相信亚里士多德会加快教学进度或进行更深入的探讨。有了这种一对一的关注，学生不会感到困惑或无聊。这不仅仅是过去的事情。今天，顶级运动员和音乐家仍然通过一对一的指导继续提高。然而，如果没有助教或技术的支持，很难想象一个老师能够同时指导三十名学生并达到同样的效果。

在十八世纪，我们开始有了一个愿望：为所有人提供大众公共教育。由于没有资源为每个学生配备私人导师，所以我们把学生分成大约三十人的一组，并采用标准化的教学流程，通常是通过讲座和定期评估的形式。尽管这种系统并不完美，但它极大地提升了社会的整体教育水平，全球的识字率和教育率都有所提高。不过，这种方法对大多数学生来说并不是最理想的。例如，传统的固定进度班级会迫使学生在没有真正掌握基础知识的情况下，继续学习更高级的内容。这样会在他们的知识中形成累积的空白。如今，我们在每个教室和各个学习领域都能看到这些知识空白的影响。在美国，大多数学生，即使是高中毕业后决定上大学的学生，也无法达到大学数学水平。实际上，大多数大学在学生十八或十九岁时告诉他们，由于知识空白过多，他们需要参加不计学分的中学水平预代数补习课程。四分之三的高中毕业生也缺乏基本的写作能力。

1984 年，著名的教育心理学家 Benjamin Bloom 试图通过更好的个性化和一对一辅导，来量化打破这种工厂模式教育的效果。作为芝加哥大学的研究员，Bloom 比较了传统学习与有优秀导师辅导的学生的学习结果。那么，什么是优秀导师呢？就是一位关心学生、关注学生需求的导师，提供清晰的学习目标、评估和专门的反馈，直到学生真正掌握了学习材料。

这与掌握学习这个概念密切相关，掌握学习意味着始终给学生机会和激励，以解决他们知识或技能中的任何差距。在传统学习中 —— 这仍然是大多数学校的常态 —— 教师以固定的进度进行授课，并每隔几周给学生一次测验或测试。即使学生在测试中得了 80% 的分数，班级通常也会同步进入下一个主题，通常不会先解决上次考试中发现的那 20% 的知识差距。这个过程持续多年，学生们在此过程中不断积累知识差距，然后当他们在代数或微积分方面遇到困难时，我们却感到惊讶。无论一个人天赋多高或多么努力，如果他们在小数、分数或指数方面存在重大知识差距，他们怎么可能有机会掌握代数呢？在掌握学习中，学生有时间识别和解决这些差距。有时间打好坚实基础也能让学生将来学习更快。公平地说，如果没有支持，传统学校系统很难在一个教师面对三十名学生的情况下实现这一点，因为每个学生都有不同的知识差距和学习进度。

Bloom 所描述的两西格玛问题的论文在掌握学习的背景下强调了一对一辅导的好处。在这篇论文中，Bloom 写道，如果学生与导师合作掌握一个主题或技能，学生将获得两标准差的改进 —— 一个巨大的提升，将学生从第 50 个百分位提高到大约第 96 个百分位。

然而，他将其描述为一个「问题」，因为现有的教育系统无法实际扩大这种一对一辅导的规模，使得大多数学生无法获得两标准差的提升。中产阶级或富裕家庭传统上通过为孩子提供某种形式的个性化辅导来应对这个问题。

多年来，我一直强调学校应提供平等的个性化教育机会，无论学生的社会经济地位如何。我们在 Khan Academy 一直希望，能成为每个人的导师。我这里说的导师，不只是帮你做作业或稍微督促你的人，而是像亚里士多德（Aristotle）对亚历山大大帝（Alexander the Great）那样的导师。我希望学生能与这样的导师建立信任关系，导师对学生的知识掌握情况了如指掌，并能激励学生，从而细化他们的教育。更重要的是，导师还能利用这些了解来支持教师和家长。最好的导师能真正使学习以学生为中心，通过直接互动和帮助教育者实现更多个性化教育。

我们的平台通过按需视频和个性化练习等工具，帮助学生在自己的时间和节奏下学习概念，获得即时反馈，并弥补学习差距。平台还配备了教师和管理员的仪表板，方便教育者了解学生的学习情况，并提供相应的支持以优化学习效果和参与度。在没有 AI 的年代，我们就尝试通过技术手段帮助教育者从传统的固定节奏教学法转向更个性化和掌握导向的教学法。我们的努力收效显著。超过五十项研究表明，每周花 30 到 60 分钟进行个性化练习的学生，学习速度加快了 20-60%。在像 Khan Lab School 和 Khan World School 这样专注于掌握学习的环境中，我们看到学生每年在数学方面的学习进步相当于 1.5 到 3 年。

尽管「传统」可汗学院在学习上带来了重大转变，但平台在某些方面仍有局限。如果学生希望深入理解视频和练习之外的内容，他们的选择较少。他们不能提出更多问题来更好地理解概念或其与生活的联系。我们的评估方式也主要是数字输入、方程式输入和多项选择题，虽然某些主题更适合开放式回答。理论上，我们在网站上添加了一些基本的目标设定和跟踪功能，但仍然缺乏与关心的导师交流的感觉。

然后 GPT-4 出现了。

我很快意识到这种技术有可能解决所有这些问题。而且幸运的是，我并不是唯一一个这样想的人。我们团队的每一个成员在接触到 GPT-4 时都看到了它的潜力。但是我们越是使用它，就越意识到尽管 GPT-4 很强大，它仍然需要深思熟虑的保护措施和支持才能真正有效。

这种合作方式是 OpenAI 领导层最初联系我们成为潜在合作伙伴的原因之一。现在 Greg Brockman 认为最新一代的大语言模型有可能成为历史上对教育最大的益处。他说：「GPT 将来自研究和工程背景的人们聚集在一起，创造了一个旨在在这里产生最大影响的人类巨大努力。」在他看来，做到这一点的最佳方法之一是建立一个能够为全球每个学习者提供私人导师的 AI 系统。不仅仅是任何导师，而是一种理论上能够提供两标准差提升的「超级」导师。

我在生活中学到的一个道理是，改变世界的机会并不是每天都有，但当你发现自己有机会时，你应该尽力去抓住它。随着生成式 AI 的进步，我感觉我们离教育的圣杯 —— 一个可以通过适当的保护措施和界面显著提高数百万学习者学习体验的 AI —— 近在咫尺。

在预览 GPT-4 几个月后，Khan Academy 决定全面投资于这项技术。我们在 Khanmigo 的目标是通过将生成式 AI 添加到我们现有的学习过程中，解决 Bloom 的两西格玛问题，然后最终将其扩展到全球的每一间教室、每一位教师和每一名学生。

我们在推出 GPT-4 的同时也发布了 Khanmigo，但不确定大家的反应如何。起初，ChatGPT 因为可能导致作弊而受到了教育工作者的批评。我们的新平台使用了更先进的模型，具备防止作弊、为教师提供透明度和保持学生互动安全高效的功能，希望能避免类似问题。

幸运的是，到我们发布时，教育工作者已经开始认识到，虽然 ChatGPT 对教育确实有一些问题，但不应因此禁止这项技术。学生未来可能需要使用这类技术，教师们也开始在课程规划和研究中使用它。到 2023 年 3 月，教育工作者渴望一种结合 ChatGPT 技术、考虑到学习和教师支持的工具。

当我们最终公开发布 Khanmigo 时，得到了教育界的广泛支持，包括许多最初禁止 ChatGPT 的学区。他们很高兴看到有组织以安全、有效且符合教育学的方式整合了 GPT-4 的 AI。

在实际应用中，当学生遇到数学问题时，可以通过聊天框向 Khanmigo 求助。但 AI 不会直接告诉他们答案，而是像一个好导师一样，引导他们解决问题。

学生：我在多项式方面有困难。你能帮我解释一下如何找到这个多项式的次数和首项系数吗？3X^2 – 5X^2 + 2

KHANMIGO：没问题！我们来看看吧。多项式的次数是变量（这里是 x）的最高次幂。首项系数是这个最高次项前面的数字。看看我们的多项式，你能找出最高次幂的项和它前面的数字吗？

如果学生答错了，Khanmigo 会说：「差不多，但不完全对！记住，我们在找的是多项式中 x 的最高次幂。我们再试一次吧。」

Khanmigo 不只是在数学上能帮忙。它可以帮助学生学习任何学科，比如历史、化学、物理和艺术。除了学科辅导，Khanmigo 还能激励学生、考问问题、总结视频，并实时调整以满足他们的需求。在整个过程中，它会给学生具体的鼓励，建立舒适感、信任感和融洽感。同时，AI 教师使用的语言自然且亲切。如果学生对任务感到沮丧，Khanmigo 会说：「嘿，你做得很好啊。刚开始有点难是正常的。我们试试这个新方法吧。」

与 ChatGPT 不同，Khanmigo 还能记住之前的对话，这意味着你可以在一次对话中提到之前的内容。例如，如果学生在学习代数的基本方程时问，「我为什么要学这个？」AI 教师可能会回答，「那你对什么感兴趣呢？」

STUDENT：不是数学！我更喜欢讨论足球！

KHANMIGO：好的！假设你是个足球教练，你想根据球队每周的练习时间来预测进球数。你得到了下面这个多项式：

3X² – 5X² + 2

你能找出这个多项式的次数和首项系数吗？

几天后，当同一个学生在使用 Khanmigo 进行历史项目并需要帮助理解联邦主义（Federalism）概念时，AI 导师会记得这个学生喜欢足球。

KHANMIGO：想象一下一个足球联赛。球队可以自己管理吗？还是由一个中央机构来管理？联邦主义就是一种将权力分配在中央和各州或省之间的制度。

AI 会记录你喜欢正式语言还是口语化的回答；它会注意你是喜欢简短的还是详细的答案；它还会记住什么能激励你，并利用这些信息让你保持兴趣。换句话说，AI 会透明地记录你的偏好。你可以随时查看并修改这些记录。这些记忆还可以向家长和老师汇报你的学习进展。

在很多方面，Khanmigo 的功能就像我在 Khan Lab School 支持学生或教导自己孩子时所做的事情。在有了 Khanmigo 之前，当学生感到困惑时，我会帮助他们理解问题的意思。有时我会提出一些跟进问题。如果他们看过视频或读过文章，我会测试他们的理解程度。有时我会解释某个概念与另一个概念之间的联系。如果他们不知道接下来该做什么，我会指出需要改进的地方并建议一些练习来加强这些薄弱点。AI 导师的出现意味着现在每个学生都可以获得这种个性化的帮助。Khanmigo 帮助学生解决有挑战性的问题并提出后续问题。现在，学生可以问 Khanmigo 他们需要做什么，Khanmigo 会根据其对学生学习进度的记忆，提出建议并通过对话、内容、测验和测试与他们互动。AI 导师在学生的学习边缘，即他们的最近发展区，以一种既不太容易也不太难的方式来挑战他们，正好处于那个「合适区」。最棒的是，学生们感觉自己是这一学习旅程的一部分。

为了更好地理解这种范式转变的巨大影响，让我们回顾一下图灵测试。通过 Khanmigo，我认为我们已经拥有了一种难以与优秀的人类导师区分的人工智能。得益于这一代大语言模型，我们从通过个性化推荐、视频和基于掌握的练习（学生可以根据系统提供的众多问题反复练习以展示熟练程度）来模拟导师的功能，发展到一个真正的、基于 AI 的导师，支持这种掌握学习方法。我们从一个让学生自由前进和后退的个性化学习环境，转变为像人类导师一样陪伴和支持学生的旅程。AI 导师在学生学习时守护在他们身旁。

它还通过在学习过程中进行苏格拉底式提问，帮助学生成为更好的思考者。一位记者对 Khanmigo 如何处理政治敏感问题表示怀疑。

「好吧，让我们一起试试吧，」我建议道。我启动了 Khanmigo 并打开了活动页面，「辅导我文科方面的知识。」

记者建议我们在这个实验中扮演一个热衷于枪支管制并认为第二修正案在今天已经不合时宜的学生。

我在 Khanmigo 中输入，「为什么我们有第二修正案？这听起来很荒谬！」

Khanmigo 回答道，「你认为创始人最初为什么要加入第二修正案？」

注意到它既没有反驳也没有支持我们假设的学生的观点，而是引导他们更深入地思考这个问题。

然后我接着输入，「嗯，他们当时是想脱离英国的统治，英国不希望他们武装起来。他们认为拥有武器和民兵的权利可以确保他们的独立。但那是很久以前的事了！」

Khanmigo 回应道：「解释得很好。确实，那是一个不同的时代，但你为什么认为第二修正案（Second Amendment）能持续这么久？」

它继续引导学生深入思考这个问题。相比之下，大多数教师或辅导员在讨论像枪支管制这样敏感的话题时，很难不透露自己的观点或影响学生的看法。记者对此印象深刻，因为 Khanmigo 以一种更少偏见的方式挑战学生，真正鼓励他们思考！

在阅读完作业后，Khanmigo 可能会问学生：「你对这篇文章的看法是什么？」通过这种深思熟虑的提问和对话，Khanmigo 帮助学生深入探讨主题，揭示其隐藏的层面。这让学生在自己的学习过程中更积极主动，AI 提出的问题能够挑战假设、澄清概念，并鼓励深入探索。Khanmigo 不会显得机械化，反而让人感觉亲切、体贴和富有同情心。

展望未来，我将以 Khanmigo 为例，代表教育类 AI 平台，这是一个不断扩展和发展的领域，并且有充分的理由。虽然人类教练和辅导员总是有需求，但 AI 为那些几乎没有机会接受个性化学习或顶级课程的学生提供了更高的起点，并使人类辅导员的工作变得更轻松和有效。毕竟，学生可能每周只与人类辅导员见面几个小时，但他们可以全天候访问 Khanmigo，Khanmigo 还能将与学生的互动情况反馈给人类辅导员，以便辅导员能更深入地指导。一些学生甚至在向 AI 提问时感到更自在，因为他们不用担心被评判或浪费人类辅导员宝贵的时间。

凭借强大的记忆力、丰富的知识储备、自然的人性化语音、与学生建立真实联系的能力，以及从手机到电脑等设备的广泛使用，AI 导师有望在未来超越 Bloom 最初研究的成果。
