Bolstering Collaborative Learning

When it comes to our children, technology has proven to be a double-edged sword. Their phones and social media accounts are optimized to keep their eyes on the screen and pull them away from living in the moment, even if the impulsive scrolling of their "feed" makes them feel terrible or triggered or envious. At first blush, it is reasonable to fear that large language models infiltrating the education system will only make this problem of tech-induced isolation and mental stress worse.

These fears came up in the early days of Khan Academy. The idea behind the nonprofit educational organization was that we could use technology—in this case, personalized practice and on-demand videos—to raise the floor for students who have fewer resources and raise the ceiling for classrooms, allowing them to support and engage students through personalization. Some people worried that more time on computers meant less time communicating, collaborating, and connecting with humans.

I worried about it too. We know that when students talk and work together in collaborative teams, they learn material better than when they sit alone quietly listening. Even more, when learning alongside and collaborating with others, students develop different character and communication skills that are arguably even more important than the academic content. Would technology further isolate students by allowing them to learn alone on a computer?

It turns out that not only does this not have to be the case, but thoughtful use of technology can actually increase human-to-human interaction.

In many typical math classrooms, students can struggle to pay attention during a teacher-led lecture. The teacher attempts to pace their lecture to the "middle," which means that many students are either lost or bored. There may be some group problem solving, but most of the time students are listening, not doing. They are usually not allowed to talk to one another for most of the class. The teacher knows that students have individual questions, but either the teacher doesn't have the bandwidth to address them all or, even more likely, students are afraid to ask them for fear of appearing "dumb" or "nerdy."

On the other hand, good implementations of Khan Academy in the classroom over the past decade have involved more human interaction, not less. While students are engaged in their independent practice, they are also encouraged to seek help from each other (with some guidelines to prevent too much help). With every student practicing and engaging at their learning edge while supported by peers, it frees the teacher to do focused one-on-one or small-group interventions.

We have even started to scale this model online. On the Schoolhouse.world platform, any student in the world can get free, live tutoring via Zoom (thanks to Zoom's donating thousands of licenses to the effort). This is done by using vetted volunteer "near peers" to tutor others. Reaching ten thousand or so students a month, it reinforces the notion that, used well, technology can increase human-to-human interaction.

Now here we are again, at the cusp of a major transition in how we educate our kids thanks to technology. We worry that even safe and effective generative AI tutors will mean even more student time with the computer and less time with peers and teachers. But, once more, it doesn't have to be this way. First, the AI can make the implementation model of Khan Academy even more productive for everyone. Students can still get help from each other and the teacher, but they will also be able to use the AI. Second, whether in a math class or not, if students can feel more engaged and unblocked in their learning, they will be able to learn more on their own time, when they are at home or doing independent work. This frees up time in the classroom for deeper human-to-human interaction like Socratic dialogue, group problem solving, or project-based learning. Last, AI help in the classroom can further reduce instances in which students feel lost or bored, allowing them to engage with what is happening alongside their fellow classmates. A struggling student can have their questions answered in real time without fear of judgment or slowing down the class. A precocious student could deepen their understanding further than where the class happens to be. And let's not forget that while this is all happening, the AI can also keep the teacher in the loop as to what is going on, providing tips on how to better engage their students.

A properly designed AI can take things even further and actually facilitate conversations among human beings. Imagine an AI like Khanmigo working with the teacher to divide students into breakout groups and then facilitating the discussion in each breakout. Imagine an AI offering an "icebreaker" chat among initially anonymous students in the same classroom so they can understand one another better without all of the prejudgment, baggage, or assumptions around who is a jock or nerd that all too often cloud middle and high school interactions. Meanwhile, the teacher can chat with the AI to understand how the students are interacting with each other . And this doesn't need to happen just over a chat interface; our team is actively testing Khanmigo interactions where it can listen to, and naturally speak to, students.

With AI and AI-based tutors, the days of static learning are over as collaborative education expands in scope and capability. In the classroom, a teacher can have Khanmigo ask participants if they want to play a learning game together. It can facilitate multistep projects among groups of participants who work in tandem to solve complex problems. For, say, a third-grade science class, the AI tutor can suggest a group collaborative maker project, offering instructions on how to design several varieties of paper airplanes. "Remember, making and testing paper airplanes is a fun way to learn about aerodynamics and the scientific method," Khanmigo tells the students. "All together, let's have everyone experiment with these three different designs and folding techniques to see how they affect the airplane's flight. Enjoy!" From here, it can divide tasks, coordinate their efforts, provide step-by-step guidance, and offer feedback, fostering collaboration and the development of teamwork skills.

You are always going to get better collaboration if you have a great facilitator, and the large language models have the potential to do just that. Like all great teachers, they could lead conversations and collaborations among students. They could pair learners together. They could create groups. They could offer icebreakers and connect strangers. At the end of the day, academic learning isn't really the only purpose of schooling. Schooling is also about building human connection through friendships, shared adventures, and mutual support. We now have a shot at using AI to facilitate these types of interactions above and beyond unblocking students in their coursework.

AI Meets Student Mental Health Coaching

Here's the scenario: You're minutes away from taking a final exam. You've studied, but your heart is racing and your mind has gone blank. Anxiety and fear of failure are eating up all of your confidence. A quick connection with Khanmigo and its AI-academic-coach feature becomes an emotional lifeline.

STUDENT: I have a test in ten minutes and I'm really nervous about it.

AI ACADEMIC COACH: Oh, I see you're feeling a bit jittery, eh? That's okay, it happens to the best of us! Just remember, you've prepared for this with hours of study and all of those quizzes you aced with me.

STUDENT: I know, but I'm worried I'm going to bomb this test. So much pressure.

AI ACADEMIC COACH: It is natural to be worried. Tell me what you are most worried about if you don't do well.

STUDENT: What if I fail the test and then fail the whole class? What if I have to retake the class next semester as a result?

AI ACADEMIC COACH: That's a pretty scary thought. I think that would worry almost anyone. But, if you fail the test, would you really fail the whole class?

STUDENT: Well, realistically, probably not.

AI ACADEMIC COACH: I agree. Odds are pretty good you'll have a chance to raise your overall grade even if you do not do well today. One more question: I do not see any record that you've failed a test before in this class. What evidence is there that you'll fail this one?

STUDENT: None. But I'm still nervous.

AI ACADEMIC COACH: Of course you are, because tests bring out anxiety in all of us. Let's try some quick breathing exercises together that might help.

An AI tutor naturally guides a student through their educational journey, forming genuine connections and gaining deep understanding of their needs. Given these attributes, it's not much of a leap to envision the AI becoming a kind of coach to the student too.

But should it? Even if it is really good at listening and talking, how competent can an AI coach or therapist really be?

In the 1960s, a researcher at MIT created a surprisingly simple but notable application that helped pave the way for the development of modern chatbots and virtual assistants. Working in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Joseph Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, one of the world's first natural-language-processing computer programs that was able to simulate a conversation. Weizenbaum set out to show how artificial the communication was between a human and an AI, but instead he was shocked to learn that many people became emotionally attached to the artificial intelligence. Those using ELIZA often forgot that they were conversing with a computer. As the story goes, Weizenbaum's secretary even asked him to leave the room occasionally so that she would be able to have a "real conversation" with the AI in confidence.

One of the scripts Weizenbaum developed for ELIZA was called DOCTOR, a program that imitated a therapist. This therapist employed the psychological approach developed by Carl Rogers, known as Rogerian theory. Basically, a patient spoke to DOCTOR, and DOCTOR responded as a Rogerian therapist might, by using nondirectional questioning and reframing statements. ELIZA was not complicated or sophisticated; it simply rephrased your statements. The reason it worked was simple enough, though. Sometimes we all just crave a good listener. On one level, it seems almost fraudulent that an algorithm rephrasing whatever you said can make you feel heard. The thing was, it actually did help people. The ability to pause, reframe our questions, and dig a little bit deeper into ourselves is therapeutic.

Once again, to his surprise, Rogers found that DOCTOR worked as well as a human therapist in key tasks. This is huge when we consider that since 2010 the United States has seen a 40 percent rise in mental health crises among school-age children. That includes one in three university students. A similar percentage leaves higher education without obtaining the degree for which they enrolled due to anxiety and depression and feelings of isolation. In 2023 the U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, called this phenomenon an epidemic of loneliness.

"I realized that behind so many of the stories I was hearing around chronic illness, around depression, around addiction were these threads of loneliness where people would often say to me, ‘You know, I feel I have to carry all these burdens in my life by myself,' or, ‘I feel if I disappear tomorrow, nobody would even care. They wouldn't even notice.' People felt invisible," Murthy tells me. "And it wasn't just the people we stereotypically think of as lonely—perhaps the older individual who's living at home by themselves. I was hearing this from college students who were surrounded by thousands of other students on campus but still felt profoundly alone. I was hearing this from moms and dads in neighborhoods where they were connected to the school, connected to their neighbors, but still didn't quite feel like there was anybody that they could truly confide in, or anyone who truly got them and understood them, and so on."

Murthy came to realize that loneliness, and this feeling of being isolated, is extraordinarily common, and it has profound effects on and implications for our physical and mental health. We also know that both mental health problems and academic underperformance have a similar cause in students: an innate sense that they have little control and purpose in their lives, he says. We have seen a much-needed turn to focus on the mental health of our kids, and for good reason. Longitudinal surveys published in JAMA Pediatrics show that anxiety and depression have both skyrocketed among students since 2020 due to the pandemic and its associated effects, including stress, social isolation, uncertainty about the future, financial difficulties, and concerns about health and safety.

Today, more than ever, issues of mental health have as much of a place in our schools as STEM. It was only a matter of time before people started looking to digital psychological aid, otherwise known as integrative psychological artificial intelligence. If ELIZA could help people feel heard fifty years ago, then perhaps modern AIs could go much further. To be clear, I am not espousing replacement of real therapists. No matter how attached people become to their AI therapist—or AI tutor, for that matter—the technology will never, and should never, replace the human element. However, AI can be much more accessible whenever, and wherever, someone might need it, often at times when a human counselor or therapist is unavailable or cost prohibitive. We are already seeing examples of this.

In 2022, for instance, researchers from the South China University of Technology tested the efficacy of AI-based therapeutic interventions by having a chatbot deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, another traditional therapy for treating depression and anxiety. The therapy chatbot was able to reduce depression in people within four months and anxiety in people in as quickly as one month. It worked significantly better than self-help books.

Then GPT-4 arrived, and our team began experimenting with AI-based coaching and support. Part of this involved exploring ways to do pedagogical or mindset interventions on Khanmigo. We did this exploration with Angela Duckworth, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania who is one of a handful of leaders who studies and creates lightweight interventions, changing people's mindset by increasing grit, perseverance, and other metacognitive capabilities. Because most of these interventions require a trained expert to deliver them, they are not generally accessible. We collaborated with Duckworth and her team to see how we might work with generative AI to scale these interventions at a high level of consistency, bringing this benefit to tens of millions of students.

"I think that people will always want to be with, understood by, and cared for by other people, but we are seeing a lot of promise with simulated interventions," Duckworth says. Given the transactional nature of therapy, psychological services are not always there when you need them. Even if you do have access to proper mental health services, the AI therapist is going to fill in the gaps. It will connect with you when it is three in the morning and you are having a panic attack before class, or when you freeze before the SAT and simply cannot reach a therapist on the phone.

Consider this test intervention:

AI ACADEMIC COACH: Look around you. What objects do you notice?

STUDENT: A desk. A pencil. A cat. A cell phone.

AI ACADEMIC COACH: Okay, now, which of these objects do you think is helping you with your focus, and which of these are hurting you?

STUDENT: Well . . . you know, the cell phone sometimes distracts me.

AI ACADEMIC COACH: Well, all right, is there anything you can do about that?

STUDENT: I could maybe put it somewhere out of sight.

AI ACADEMIC COACH: There's actually a great amount of research that shows that the farther away you place your cell phone, the higher your GPA is.

In this example, the AI is engaging on a behavioral psychology level, offering what Duckworth calls "situational modifications," or interventions that help young people develop metacognitive skills. "The AI enables truly interactive interventions, with students interacting with, and getting feedback, in real time," she says.

The AI is great at proposing situational modifications so that students are happier and more focused and productive and increase their growth mindset. Traditionally, only highly trained educational psychologists administered them. With the AI, you can now bring these interventions to students whenever they want or need them. "Even as we develop these self-regulation interventions, we're also thinking about ways to make AI psychologically wiser," Duckworth says. She and her research team hope that the world will soon be able to use an artificial intelligence that can perform such interventions in as dynamic a way as a human being can, with consistency and reliability. The problem of administering new interventions to every human being on the planet in a cost-effective way disappears when the method of administrating treatments is as pervasive as Khan Academy, and people can access it from a cell phone.

Duckworth's interventions are only one class of best-practice support that AI might now be able to scale. Encouraging evidence on this front is already starting to emerge. The Journal of Medical Internet Research reports that these AIs show more promise than pre-AI general mental health applications that only offer one-size-fits-all approaches and surface-level interventions.

People share a common assumption that AI is going to be more helpful for tasks that require IQ than tasks that require EQ, or emotional quotient. Early explorations in the effort to create AI tutors, coaches, and counselors, along with the AI-led interventions we're working on with Angela Duckworth's team, make me wonder whether that is true.

Because AIs aren't sentient, they can't be truly empathetic. Empathy involves sensing and modeling other's emotions and contexts in your own mind. They can, however, simulate empathy quite well. Even with just a chat interface, large language models can interact in ways that are hard to discern from a well-trained, caring therapist. Engineers are augmenting these models with listening, speech, and vision capabilities that can add to the AI's "understanding" of where the user is emotionally. Perhaps we should introduce a new term, artificial empath, or AE, as a great tool in the fight against loneliness, depression, and anxiety.

The Place for Parents in AI-Based Education

As a father, I try—oh, how I try—to encourage my kids to put down the technology. I am betting this sounds familiar to most parents. Personally, I worry that if left to their own devices (literally and figuratively), my sons are just going to play Minecraft or code, and my daughter will stream every episode of Sister, Sister or Korean soap operas, in perpetuity. I want them to spend more time playing outside with friends, creating forts in the living room, reading books, drawing, or doing something creative and productive instead of vegging. I want them to study more and engage in activities that make them feel academically, physically, and socially confident. I want them to push themselves out of their comfort zones. And when our kids are struggling with any of the above, I want them to feel supported, even when things get hard or uncomfortable.

Learning is hard work, whether it's practicing piano, drawing, or navigating uncomfortable social situations. As difficult as it is for our children to learn something new, it's equally difficult to parent them as they learn. Helping kids develop a growth mindset requires consistent effort and reinforcement, in which we offer encouragement and meaningful praise while reframing setbacks as stepping stones toward improvement. As parents, we do things like making sure our kids take breaks. We remind them that the effort matters more than the outcome and that everyone, including us, has faced failure and setbacks and is better for it. We break down challenging concepts into more manageable chunks. For more abstract material, we try to show our children how it relates to their lives. Sometimes they accept our assistance, and other times, not so much. So goes parenting.

Over the years, I have observed the benefits of technological advances in learning, and I have come to see them in parenting too. Historically, parents have had limited choices when their children needed academic help. Some parents feel confident with the material students are learning, but most don't. The parent-child dynamic can be difficult even when the parent is a fairly competent tutor on the subject. I can attest to this dynamic with my own family.

Sometimes a nonparent family member can also help—my sister used to tutor me, and I famously tutored my cousins—but that is still unusual and fraught with family dynamics. For parents who don't have the time or capability to tutor their children themselves but are middle or upper-middle class, they often turn to paid tutors. Families without those resources are essentially stuck.

The internet, and especially on-demand video, offered an alternative. Beyond addressing some of the limitations of traditional tutoring, these technologies offered students the opportunity to read or watch bite-sized explanations. The videos were on demand, pause-able, and watchable at half or double speed. With the development of Khan Academy, students were able to practice and assess their understanding in most topics in nearly any language, anytime, and anywhere.

This wasn't just for student support, though. Parents would regularly tell me about how they used it to bone up on concepts so that they could tutor their children better.

Still, a gap remained between what you could learn from articles, videos, and exercises and what a great tutor could do. For example, the benefits of rapport, motivational support, and dynamic conversation between the technology and the student remained elusive. For these interactive qualities, learners still needed to turn to a parent, teacher, or tutor.

That changed, however, with AI technology and the introduction of large language models. In previous chapters, I introduced readers to the ways in which technology has met the interpersonal challenges by creating AI tutors and personal coaches that better understand where your children are in their studies and offer real-time encouragement and supplemental support. These AI tutors can personalize and customize coaching, as well as adapt to an individual's needs while hovering beside our learners as they work. Even more impressive, this technology teaches our learners to be better thinkers by engaging them in Socratic questioning.

But what does this AI mean for parents and their roles in helping their kids learn? We know artificial intelligence is going to transform our day jobs, but how is it going to transform our even more important job as parents?

There are several dimensions of parenting where generative AI is becoming hugely relevant, beginning with parents serving as tutors to their children. Every parent has dealt with a child getting frustrated. The experience is vexing on both sides. The parent tries to motivate the child, or explain a concept, but the child feels pressure or judgment. As a result, the parent-child dynamic can sometimes get a little bit heated, ending with children saying they do not want to do the work with the parent.

Here, the AI can play a powerful role, in the same way that I did for my cousin Nadia twenty years earlier, when I was tutoring her in math. On the one hand, I was educated in the United States and had a math background, so I was able to support Nadia in her math education much better than her parents. At the same time, part of the benefit of my working with her was that I wasn't one of Nadia's parents. The AI utilizes the same dynamic. There is value in having a nonparent third party. Khanmigo can build rapport with kids like I did with my cousins and not fall into some of the traditional parent-child dynamics.

The AI tutor knows the material and is a subject-matter expert that can provide personalized, adaptive learning exercises based on a student's individual needs and abilities. It can also offer immediate feedback and adjust its teaching methods. Unlike any parent I know, the AI tutor has endless energy and no other job but to be on call to help a student all day, every day, whenever and wherever our kids need it, whereas we, as parents, are . . . well, only human.

All the while, generative AI platforms are able to offer interfaces that allow parents to keep track of the conversations that their children are having with the AI, affording them a window into exactly what a child has been learning. The AI can also proactively reach out to students and parents through texts designed to ensure that learners remain engaged and motivated while the AI holds them gently accountable.

Then there's the other job of parenting: trying to help students develop solid life skills, such as learning to be resilient, to focus, and to deal with grief and adversity in healthy ways. Here, once again, generative AI can help with parental support, offering guidance for parents, whether it's advice on best practices for reaching kids, navigating bullying, or moving through thorny social issues that come up between a child and their friends. Generative AI can provide parents with resources and time that might otherwise require sessions with a therapist or reading parenting self-help books. The AI becomes a parenting coach.

PARENT: My teenage daughter is having trouble working with a teacher in her school. I don't know what to do to help her. Do you have any parenting advice?

KHANMIGO: Oh, that can be a pickle! Have you thought about having a chat with the teacher to understand their perspective? It might help to know what they're thinking!

PARENT: I've tried. It's like we're talking past each other.

KHANMIGO: Hmm, that's a toughie! How about bringing in a third party, like a school counselor or principal, to help mediate the conversation? Could that be a good next step?

PARENT: What if I want to try to reach her myself? Any suggestions?

KHANMIGO: Ah, a DIY approach! Dealing with such situations can be challenging, but there are several steps you can take to help support your daughter. Talk to your daughter about her concerns and encourage her to express her feelings and thoughts about the situation. Assure her that you are there to listen and support her. Also, gain a clear understanding of the issue by gathering all the facts. Ask your daughter specific questions about what difficulties she is experiencing with the teacher, and try to identify any underlying causes or patterns. Seek additional perspectives and eventually communicate with the teacher directly. Ultimately, help your daughter develop resilience by teaching her strategies to cope with difficult situations. Encourage her to seek support from friends, engage in activities she enjoys, and practice self-care to manage her emotions.

Beyond tutoring and behavioral psychology guidance, generative AI can help parents with their own mindfulness by offering suggestions proven to lower parenting stress.

KHANMIGO: I understand that being a parent can be stressful at times. While I'm not an expert in parenting, I can offer some general tips to help you manage stress. Take breaks. Give yourself some time to relax and recharge. Even a short walk or a few minutes of deep breathing can help. Prioritize tasks by making a list of tasks you need to accomplish and focusing on one task at a time. Be sure to not be too hard on yourself if you can't get everything done. It's also important to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to share your experiences and learn from others in similar situations.

If used well, AI ultimately strengthens a parent's ability to help their kids learn and grow. This in no way diminishes the holistic understanding a parent has of their child's development, strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles. Parents continue to provide the nurturing environment kids need by instilling values and serving as role models. The AI can provide the parent more tools and contexts with which to understand and guide their children. Just as AI can act as a teaching assistant, it can act as a parenting assistant. The best teacher or parent assistant is the one that children can turn to exactly when they need support.

Increasing Points of Connection Between Parents and Their Kids

From the moment I first used GPT-4 to the day our team concluded its hack-AI-thon, I found myself awed by its capabilities. The possibilities in those early days truly seemed endless. The rest of the world had yet to experience the radical positive and negative changes about to rock education, and the world at large. It wasn't hard to imagine AI soon becoming intertwined in every part of our lives. Already wary of the effect that cell phones and social media have on people, especially our children, this proposition was both promising and worrying. My thinking was, even if AI becomes a net positive, those moments in which we unplug and turn off our screens become much scarcer. We only have so much time to bond with our children, and the coming AI revolution made me want to ensure that it didn't sweep away the real time that a family can have together. As exciting as this prospect was, after weeks of prototyping and watching my own children do their work with the AI tutor, I found myself doing something equally radical. I logged off.

I loaded my family in the car and we drove an hour to a dog-friendly beach in San Francisco overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. We played with our new six-month-old puppy, Polly, and ate a picnic lunch together. As the day came to a close, we took an extra-long and slow drive back home while connecting over conversations both weighty and trivial.

Generative AI is neither an abdication of parental responsibility nor simply a tool for keeping an eye on our kids. Rather, like all technology before it, it is a tool that we can use to amplify our intent. If we use it well, the technology enhances the dynamic between parents and their kids. For parents, it may provide us with more opportunities for creating points of connectedness. I live in Silicon Valley, a double-edged sword from a parenting point of view. The region is a hub of innovation and creativity. Living here, kids learn that no idea is too big and that a few young people working out of a garage can change the world. The region attracts amazing talent that, for the most part, found success because of their education and work ethic. At the same time, growing up in such an environment can also create intense pressure on children. I have seen firsthand how some parents define their own worth by their children's accomplishments. They obsesses over their children's test scores, extracurriculars, and college admissions. On the other end of this extreme spectrum, we have children of wealthy families who believe they can coast through their academics and rely on their trust fund. The problem is that life satisfaction comes from establishing goals, working hard, and feeling as though you are moving the world toward a better place.

So much of parenting happens at the dinner table and on the way to school. Together, my wife and I view our role as one specifically designed to help our children create as many options for themselves as possible, all while they build resilience, mindfulness, and a healthy sense of self and purpose. Work and life should challenge them, but not too much, and certainly not in a way that makes them feel their self-worth is somehow conditional on their accomplishments. A little bit of competitiveness can be healthy, but they also need perspective and balance.

Fully aware that there is no perfect way to do this, we as parents try to model this ourselves by being present and taking the time with our children to have discussions with them about what it means to have a meaningful, happy life. Even a handful of interactions like this a week—during the drive to school, waiting in the dentist's office, or sitting at the dinner table—makes a difference to them.

What if there was a way to build in even more moments like this with AI? What if AI made these moments richer? Large language models can focus the learning time and create more space for other points of productive contact that a child has with parents and other people. We can use generative AI to learn new things as a family, like different languages, cultures, and traditions. By engaging in these learning experiences as a family, we bond over shared interests and goals. And, of course, generative AI can be a fun and entertaining way for families to spend time together. A family's incentive for turning to generative AI is similar to that of a family turning to outside facilitators mediating a crisis. Only, where mediators are necessary when trust breaks down, generative AI works prophylactically to strengthen a family's bonds. Whether playing games, telling jokes, or having silly conversations, a family that uses large language models in a positive and constructive way can help strengthen its relationships and create lasting memories. I want these moments with my children, just as much as I want them to develop a love for learning. These shared moments help all of us develop.

There will always be a space for parents, as well as for living, breathing tutors, motivators, mentors, and teachers. People provide all sorts of benefits that the AI is not going to be able to replicate in our lifetimes. We find that when we mix large language models into this equation, artificial intelligence makes learning quicker and frees up time for parents to connect with their kids about all the other things that make up a well-rounded person. In the future, we may even have a version of this artificial intelligence at our dinner tables or on car rides to facilitate family interactions with games and conversations. Technology is a vector, helping parents work with their kids to see the wonder and joy in knowledge together. The technology is so broad and so inviting that when you are using it, you really feel as if you were on an AI-guided journey that's designed for parents and kids to explore the world together.
