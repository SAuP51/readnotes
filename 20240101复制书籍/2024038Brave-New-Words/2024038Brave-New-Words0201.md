## Part II: Giving Voice to the Social Sciences

Art is a collaboration between God and the artist, and the less the artist does the better.

Why Students Write

Something seemed off.

The Furman University professor Darren Hick was grading papers for a class he was teaching on the philosophy of David Hume and the paradox of horror when he stumbled over one student's work. A teacher of art, ethics, law, and copyright, Hick is always on the lookout for cheating. Oftentimes, cheating looks as if a student has simply taken studies or information from the internet and cobbled it together, resulting in a paper that basically announces itself as plagiarism. This paper didn't have that, though. Rather, it was clean. Too clean.

The closer he read, the more glaringly problematic the paper became. In particular, he was struck by the incongruence of how the student so confidently spouted incorrect information as fact.

Hick began to play detective. He googled passages from the paper, just to see what turned up, but the searches came back empty. "At this point I had heard about ChatGPT, but it was a brand-new technology," he says. He created an account on OpenAI and from there reverse engineered what his student might have prompted ChatGPT to write such a clean paper. Here, he also learned that large language models at times hallucinated, stating erroneous information as fact. After some digging, he was all but certain that this student's paper was written by AI.

Talk about horror! Artificial intelligence was here, and so was every teacher's worst nightmare. Hick realized that he was facing a technology that wrote essays for students—a technology, he says, that potentially took the process of learning out of the process of writing. So Hick did what any concerned teacher might do and posted about the experience on Facebook with a warning.

There was a reason to be scared! GPT technology posed an existential threat to education as we all knew it, he wrote. His note of caution captured the fear people often express when they first learn about ChatGPT's capabilities. The AI generates text, summaries, and analysis that are nearly impossible to distinguish from those written by a human. It isn't traditional plagiarism, because it is usually novel text, something that hasn't been written that way before. Say farewell to student integrity, because the temptation to use an AI to complete assignments was going to make teaching students a profoundly more difficult endeavor. What were educators to do about it?

As one of the first professors to publicly spot these dangers, Hick saw his Facebook post go viral. Media started calling. Within days, Hick was internationally famous for having caught a student using ChatGPT, a designation that made him the new academic sheriff in town. "You'd think that would be enough to put the scare into students, but it wasn't," he says. "The very next semester, I caught someone else who used ChatGPT to write a paper too!" (My suspicion is that there were other students that he didn't catch because they likely used ChatGPT in more subtle ways and took the trouble to fact-check its output.)

Hick could try his best to spot GPT-written papers, and he could try his best, as well, to restrict students from using ChatGPT in his classroom, but in the end the task was futile. If students weren't going to change how they used ChatGPT to write, maybe it was time Hick changed how he was approaching it in his classes. Either he could spend all his time trying to adjudicate or he could lean into the work of educated bravery and consider the ways generative AI was capable of making his students better learners.

Other educators who were among the first to move into this space have reached this same impasse, too, and have also turned it into an inflection point. It is an inflection point that makes us revisit why we have writing assignments in the first place. By revisiting what we think we are trying to accomplish through a writing assignment, we can also think about how to solve the cheating issue in a post-ChatGPT world.

At its most essential, writing is a form of communication. It is a form of communication that requires structured thinking and fluency with language and grammar. And, of course, you need to know what you are going to write about. If it is editorial writing, you need to come up with an opinion and articulate first to yourself why you believe it. If it is a research paper, you need to digest what research literature already exists and, ideally, build on that with your own novel research and analysis. If it is a news story, you need to interview people to get interesting insights out of them and potentially do research from other sources, such as public records or government data. If it is fiction writing, you need to have an imagination and a sense of what makes a compelling story.

If a teacher's goal is to give students practice and assessment in structured thinking, language, and grammar, simple storytelling, or just forming and backing up an opinion, you don't necessarily need a traditional take-home writing assignment, where there is likely a strong temptation to use ChatGPT. Instead, an in-class, proctored, five-paragraph essay might do the trick, and it would unfold in a context where there is more support from the teacher (and teachers can directly observe students in their process). If the task might be hard to complete in one sitting, students can work on it in multiple classes, always with the teacher around to support students and ensure that the work is their own.

If the goal is to understand a student's ability to do novel research or their ability to conduct investigative journalism, is it even bad to use ChatGPT in the first place? After all, ChatGPT can't do the most important part—conducting an experiment or interviewing people or observing an event. Even more, in the workplace these tasks will increasingly use tools like ChatGPT, so wouldn't it be good for students to learn how to employ them while in school?

These questions and concerns start an even more fundamental conversation about the taxonomy of cheating, which is complex, contradictory, and sometimes as hard to define as it is to prevent. You could debate what's worse: getting someone to write your paper for you or outright plagiarism. Both are trying to pass off someone else's work as your own. Cutting and pasting from the internet to compile an essay is cheating, as is copying off someone else's test or handing in your big sister's paper from five years ago and calling it your own.

But what about bouncing ideas off friends or family? What about asking them to critique your work? What if you get help thinking through your thesis statement or coming up with data to back up your points?

Things get only less clear from here. Is getting help from family members, a writing coach, or tutors while writing an essay cheating? Spell-checkers and grammar-checkers might have seemed like cheating to a teacher fifty years ago, but now they are common practice. What about tools like Grammarly, which don't just correct your basic grammar but can rephrase entire paragraphs to make them clearer and more cogent? This is a commonplace tool that most teachers do not consider cheating.

And this is all before we even add generative AI to the mix. If a student asks the AI for advice but doesn't use it, asks it to punch up a paragraph, or asks it to generate a first draft that they edit and revise to the point that it is a completely different paper, do any of these scenarios constitute cheating ?

"In the humanities—English, literature, art, music, and culture—we find that generative AI is a terrific step toward helping students create something original ," says the Yale humanities professor Alexander Gil Fuentes. "We are learning what generative AI is good at and, more importantly, what it's not good at. And what it's not good at is originality."

So what is it good at?

"I tell my students to use the technology to help them from zero," Fuentes continues. "It's a first-pass tool, and it's their job to question the AI, double-check, triple-check, and use it to move their original work forward."

It's a novel concept, for sure. When we view the technology as replacing an important current function, it can be scary, because it represents a kind of loss. Yet there is a way to see it as a gain. Through the lens of educated bravery, teachers are rethinking the way they approach essay writing from start to finish.

"You are writing with the AI, but it is not writing for you," says Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he studies and teaches innovation and entrepreneurship, especially as it pertains to artificial intelligence. "For educators, embracing this change is going to be important, and it is scary. It is okay to be scared as you listen to this. But we recognize that a lot of the ways we were having people write essays before AI did not make sense." The people who weren't very good writers in class wrote bad essays outside class, too, he says. The AI helps them catch up, and it gives them an explanation of where they are with their skills; for instructors, the AI helps flag the students who need the most help and attention. "We can't pretend the world didn't change with ChatGPT. It is too late for that. This is here now, and whether we like it or not, we have to adjust as instructors."

Like Hick, Mollick pivoted; rather than ban the technology, he encouraged his students to make themselves aware of it and use it. To cheat or not to cheat is no longer the question; the semantics of cheating misses the larger picture of what this means for the pedagogical process of writing an essay. Professors can mold their own standards for cheating, meaning these boundaries are fluid. What matters more is not whether this can be called cheating but whether this can be called writing .

Mollick tells all of his students to write the best essay they can using generative AI. The difference in quality of work, relative to what he saw in previous years, is stark. "I've had students in my class who are brilliant people but not good writers, people who cite English as their third language, or people who come from backgrounds where they never learned to write really well; just having that little bit of a hint with ChatGPT has made a difference in their writing." Generative AI has made his students up their game, and it has upped Mollick's expectations of work quality in turn, leading him to change his threshold of what makes a good essay. "I no longer accept anything that isn't perfectly written at this stage. Why bother?"

Like Mollick, Fuentes, and Hick, educators are finding that these generative AI tools make our students far more skilled and efficient writers. They are also finding that, where producing essays was once seen as essential to helping students gain mastery in critical thinking and analytical and writing skills, the artificial intelligence provides students equal, and even better, opportunities to engage with a topic, gather and analyze information, and express their own ideas and arguments.

The future of writing in school will evolve into a more diverse set of activities, depending on the pedagogical goals and comfort of the teacher. I believe that it will always be valuable to learn how to structure one's thoughts and communicate grammatically. This is often best practiced through writing, but the skills also translate to oral communication. If I'm an educator looking to ensure that my students have strength here, I would do more in-class writing assignments where it is 100 percent the student's own work. I could also ask students to create videos of themselves communicating their viewpoint or message or story. Even in this case, it would probably be healthy to mix in assignments where the student can start with a draft from generative AI before fact-checking or revising it. At the other extreme, if I believe the crux of the work is more about doing things in the real world and the writing is just a way to communicate all the students' research, interviews, observations, and progress, then many teachers may allow the use of generative AI tools like the professors described above.

With Khanmigo, though, we are creating a middle path for teachers, intending to balance the need for students to learn how to write with the utility of generative AI for support. In this scenario Khanmigo acts as a powerful guide, but the student does the bulk of the work. The student can ask Khanmigo, "What points should I consider as I write an essay about The Great Gatsby ?" It will suggest themes including the American dream, social class and inequality, the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties, and key symbols in the novel, such as the green light, the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, and the Valley of Ashes. The technology works well when a student takes a couple of paragraphs of something they've written and asks the large language model to read it and critique its strengths and weaknesses. It can help students with counterarguments and make what they've written more compelling, encouraging them to think about the essay as a good writing coach might do. Again, the AI tutor does not do the work for the students. Rather, it works alongside them. Within seconds, the artificial intelligence will provide feedback, highlight areas for improvement, and offer suggestions for how to revise and refine the work. It helps craft tone, voice, and perspective even as students develop their own. At its best, an education-based AI platform can be the world's finest assistant and co-collaborator, objective in its assessments and thorough in its analytics, designed to do one thing and one thing only: to sharpen a student's skills.

This will do much more than support the student. When Khanmigo shares the final output of the student/AI collaboration with the teacher, it will also report on the process and the degree to which the AI assisted. The teacher will get a much clearer sense of a student's strengths and areas for improvement. Khanmigo can report back, "We worked on the paper for about four hours. Sal initially had trouble coming up with a thesis, but I was able to help him by asking some leading questions. The outlining went pretty smoothly. I just had to help him ensure that the conclusion really brought everything together. Sal did most of the writing. I just helped him tidy up the grammar and strengthen his argument in the third paragraph. Based on the rubric for the assignment, I'd recommend Sal get a B+ on the assignment. Here is a detailed breakdown of how I rated this paper in the dimensions on the rubric."

It would also be difficult for a student to cheat using ChatGPT in this context. If they use ChatGPT to write the essay but simply copy and paste text into their assignment, Khanmigo will tell the teacher, "We didn't work on this essay together, it just showed up, so we should be suspicious."

The Future of Reading Comprehension, Where Literature Comes Alive!

Saanvi, a ninth grader in India who attends Khan World School, a full-time online school we started with Arizona State University, was reading The Great Gatsby for class. Her teacher gave her a video assignment to discuss several key questions about the novel, and Saanvi came to one that stumped her. "In The Great Gatsby , why does Jay Gatsby keep looking at the green light?"

Uncertain of the answer, she did what many industrious students do when they find themselves stuck: she started running a bunch of web searches on the topic. She wasn't really satisfied with what she found, so she took it a step further.

She turned to Khanmigo . . . and asked to talk to Jay Gatsby himself.

JAY GATSBY: Ah, splendid to meet you, old sport. I'm now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic.

SAANVI: Mr. Gatsby, why do you keep staring at the green light?

JAY GATSBY: Ah, the green light. It is a symbol of my dreams and desires. You see, it is situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock, across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly, as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life.

"We just started talking," Saanvi tells me. "There I was, having a great conversation with Jay Gatsby. At one point I felt bad that I was taking up all of Mr. Gatsby's time, and so I apologized to him! And Gatsby said, ‘Oh, no, I'm not really Jay Gatsby, I'm just an artificial intelligence simulation.' "

This is exactly the type of interaction that engages our learners and broadens their minds. Today, you can talk to Victor Frankenstein, Hester Prynne, or Odysseus.

Beyond facilitating reading comprehension, AI can allow learners to immerse themselves in the worlds of the characters in ways that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago.

For educators, these AI writing and comprehension tools help them better understand the ways that their students read and process information. I think we can all agree that reading comprehension is extremely important. It is hard to navigate the world, much less make informed decisions, without it. One could argue that you can't even begin to write well without first being able to read well. Unfortunately, we are currently in a pretty bad state. Based on a 2020 Gallup analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Education, 54 percent of Americans between the ages of sixteen and seventy-four read below a sixth-grade level.

This is a complex issue, but I have high hopes that AI will make a meaningful dent here.

In most schools, the formal practice of reading comprehension comes from studying books and articles. The evidence of a student's understanding is usually expressed through some type of essay or in-class discussion. As rich as that experience might be, it is unfortunately hard to standardize and scale. Because of this, traditional passage-based multiple-choice questions are how most students are assessed on high-stakes tests (for example, SAT, ACT, state end-of-year exams).

Passage-based multiple-choice questions aren't inherently bad. In fact, they can be a great way to practice and assess some dimensions of reading. But they are limited in what they can do. Because of the built-in incentives for measuring student success through standardization, educators working with underperforming students tend to emphasize in-class work that mimics these multiple-choice exams, but when they do so, these students get a very narrow exposure to reading (and it isn't even clear that this approach enhances student performance on those multiple-choice exams). The focus on assessments keeps students from engaging with a more diverse set of texts and modalities. For example, most educators intuitively recognize that allowing students to give free responses and engage in dialogue about a text would likely create deeper readers. They also see that pairing reading comprehension with writing is an ideal way to practice both. Unfortunately, these types of activities are hard to standardize and evaluate at scale.

But what if we could create easily accessible, standardized practice and assessment in reading comprehension that is not multiple choice? Imagine if the assignment allows students to give free responses when discussing a text. Well, this is exactly the type of thing that large language models can be good at.

Instead of answering multiple-choice questions about a text or passage, imagine that students write out the author's intent behind a choice of words or explore the main idea of the passage (while highlighting those parts of the passage). Picture the AI then asking follow-up questions based on what a student writes. It could ask students to draft a conclusion for an incomplete essay that forces them to understand everything that came before. Based on these interactions, it can then provide feedback on their comprehension to the student and teacher. We are already working on such tools. So far, our team has found that with thoughtful prompting, it can get a large language model like GPT-4 to ask good questions and engage in a meaningful discussion about a topic. The challenge is to ensure that the AI is assessing well and doing it consistently. I believe we will get there.

Let's take this idea beyond passage-based questions. Imagine if, when reading a book, a student could have a discussion with the AI at the end of every chapter. The AI might ask the student what they think about the book so far, or whether anything was particularly interesting or confusing about the material. It might inquire about major themes or whether the student agrees with a character's point of view or action. This would all happen through a Socratic dialogue. The AI would give feedback to the student and also report this feedback to the teacher. The student could of course ask any question they like about any aspect of what they are reading. Think about how much more engaging this would be for students than the traditional book report. It is also far richer pedagogically; book reports today already often entail students summarizing the plot while including ideas they pick up off the internet or CliffsNotes.

We do not need to limit this type of reading comprehension practice to a language arts classroom, as it can extend to any type of textbook or article. Students could even design experiments with a simulation of Marie Curie or co-write a Federalist Paper with a simulation of James Madison or Alexander Hamilton.

AI and Creativity

In the late 1970s, the film director Francis Ford Coppola purchased a device called the Kurzweil Reading Machine, an early invention of Ray Kurzweil, himself a renowned futurist and inventor known for his work in artificial intelligence. The Reading Machine used optical character recognition technology to scan printed text and convert it into synthetic speech, assisting people with visual impairments in reading printed materials. Coppola, who had already converted Mario Puzo's novel into the classic film The Godfather , had an idea to teach the machine to recognize quotation marks. With a few tweaks, he could feed the machine a novel and it was able to read the text and convert all the dialogue into something that looked like a film script. Coppola called this ingenious approach to early language recognition technology a Zippy Script, a simplified approach to creating a long screenplay in a fraction of the time it would normally take a person to write one. It was going great until he was contacted by the Writers Guild.

"They said, wait, you can't have a machine writing your screenplays! But the technology behind the Zippy Script wasn't writing screenplays. All it did was change the format of the book into something like a script," Coppola tells me. Was a machine taking away the work of creatives? If more filmmakers used such devices, what would happen to screenwriters?

Without realizing it, Coppola had tripped an alarm more than forty years earlier than anyone else would, a siren that every creative, in every industry, was to eventually hear and heed with the advent of generative AI.

Today, AI has brought the fight over intellectual capital, and to a greater extent over the future of creativity itself, into sharp focus. With simple text-based prompts, AI can appear to be quite creative and produce remarkably wonderful and strange works of fiction or poetry—even screenplays. And it goes well beyond the written word. We can feed text to any number of AI programs that within seconds can take these prompts and produce fairly remarkable images, video, and music.

The first time I saw examples of this, I had the same questions I am sure many of you did: Is generative AI a creativity killer? If the root of creativity is individual agency, what happens when our kids can simply log on to an app leveraging generative AI, type in or speak a request, and then create imaginative works designed by an imagination not their own? How will our kids learn to think creatively for themselves?

The degree to which AI influences, and can limit, student creativity has brought the technology under a new shadow of scrutiny, and for understandable reasons. For proof, look no further than all the school districts that banned generative AI from classrooms, thanks to its ability to write essays and long-form answers. If machines can generate words or stories at a high enough level, why would students rely on their own creative juices? These chatbots can write blog posts, podcast scripts, novels, and even screenplays far more advanced than anything Coppola's converted Kurzweil Reading Machine might have produced.

And when they do, there's a question of just how original generative AI can be. Skeptics argue that at its most essential level it produces content based on patterns encoded in the AI model from training on existing texts. Do the limits of its training data curtail the scope of creative expressions or ideas?

Even back in the late 1970s, Coppola saw how advancements in technology not only did little to hinder creativity but also improved the creative process. In similar ways, large language models have the potential to do just that, by sparking new ideas, saving time on tedious tasks, and providing valuable revisions to work—as long as it is used right.

Noam Chomsky argues for an interesting distinction between human creativity and that of large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's LaMDA. AI is a marvel of machine learning, he writes in The New York Times , yet we know from the science of linguistics and the philosophy of knowledge that it differs profoundly from how humans create: " The human mind is a surprisingly efficient and even elegant system that operates with small amounts of information; it seeks not to infer brute correlations among data points but to create explanations," infused with a dynamic approach to seeing and creating in the world.

I agree and disagree with him. Artificial intelligence is not human, no matter how much it approximates being human. Regardless of how well it conveys intelligence, personality, and creativity, it is not a sentient, perceiving being.

Yet it is important to appreciate that much of the work we credit to our brain isn't really sentient or part of our perception. Most of our brain's activity is subconscious, including what we would often consider creativity. Any artist will tell you they often feel a flash of insight that leads to the creative act.

Similarly, how many times have you been told to "sleep on the problem"? I myself am a master of this art. In college, when I faced seemingly intractable math problems, I would engage with them for a few minutes and then delegate them to my subconscious. I would tell my brain to essentially come up with the answers and tell "me" when it was done. Most of the time, I had the answers by the next morning without having to consciously struggle with them. I'm not alone in doing this. Many people find it a useful way to approach difficult problems.

I now do the same thing when I face a tough problem while leading Khan Academy. I have faith that my brain, or someone else's, will come up with a creative solution by morning. What are our brains doing subconsciously while our consciousness waits for an answer? Clearly, when you "sleep on a problem," some part of your brain continues to work even though "you" aren't aware of it. Neurons activate, which then activate other neurons depending on the strength of the synapses between them. This happens trillions of times overnight, a process mechanically analogous to what happens in a large language model. When a plausible solution presents itself, the subconscious then surfaces it to the conscious as a flash of insight.

Meditation gives us direct experience with this. Close your eyes for a few minutes and observe your own thoughts. They really begin to feel very much like the output of a large language model—or several competing models—whose latest output gets fed as input for the next iteration of output. With a bit of practice, your conscious mind can temporarily disassociate itself from these thoughts until you experience stillness or "no thought." You'll begin to see your thoughts for what they are and aren't. They aren't you .

Think about a flow state that most experts in their craft can attain after the often-noted ten thousand hours of practice (which is analogous to pretraining for generative AI models). They will often say that their greatest creativity or actions occur when they do not allow themselves to be conscious of what they are doing. The best way to ruin their performance, or creativity, is to consciously think about what is happening. Great orators will tell you that it feels like their brain is doing the talking while their conscious selves are just there to observe the output. After making thousands of videos, I often feel this way when I press record. I won't claim that what experts' well-trained brains are doing when they create is identical to what large language models do, but it seems awfully similar.

I also take issue with Chomsky's comment that the human mind "seeks not to infer brute correlations among data points but to create explanations." Humans are experts at inferring brute correlations, so much so that they often manifest themselves as problematic biases and false narratives about how the world works. This has led to humanity constructing prejudices and complex mythologies. The entire scientific revolution, in fact, has been our best attempt to stop "infer[ring] brute correlations," which our brains seem to do so naturally, and most of us are still having trouble giving up the habit.

Some would also argue that generative AI's "creativity" is just derivative from all the data it has been exposed to. But isn't that very human as well? Even the large leaps in human creativity have been closely correlated to things that the creator has been exposed to. Would Einstein have made the leap to special relativity if he hadn't already read the work of Lorentz and countless other physicists? Are the narratives of Shakespeare, Jane Austen, or J. K. Rowling completely novel, or are they new expressions of age-old narratives? It is likely that the most exceptionally creative minds are able to draw connections from their pretraining that most brains with similar training miss. Or maybe they just had better pretraining. Once we take ourselves out of the rarefied air of an Einstein or a Shakespeare and come down to the type of creativity most of us engage in daily—designing an experiment, crafting a product, or writing a song—how much of that can we say is truly not derivative from other things we've been exposed to?

So, if you buy my argument that generative AI is actually creative in much the same way that we often are, does this mean that it will diminish the value of human creativity? I don't think so. Our creativity gains value when we are exposed to the creativity of others. We become more creative when we brainstorm with other creative people, because we riff off one another and build off one another's thoughts. A generative AI world will only accelerate this process.

The best ideas will come not from the AI creating for us but when the AI is creating and riffing with us.

Much like poets hanging out at a café in Paris, humans and AI can augment each other and inspire a mutually creative process. When it comes to learners engaging with their creative sides, there is something profoundly unique and wondrous happening when students use AI. I find that AI is best deployed as a device to promote a child's interests and passions, and to teach new ones too. Tell it you want to write a story, and it might ask you who you want the main character to be or even what you envision the character to be struggling with.

When I see my own children using this tool, I find that they are actually learning a lot more than they would if they were simply writing a story without artificial intelligence, if only because AI has engaged them in the creative process. Very few eleven-year-olds can write a really well-structured story, yet I have seen my eleven-year-old daughter learning, through AI, how to do just that. If she wants to have a direct conversation with her main character, or ask Khanmigo to play out certain plot threads, it allows my daughter as the creator to test her ideas. When the AI is designed well, it works within constraints such that it doesn't do the work for the student. At the same time, it is unconstrained in where the student can go creatively.

In early 2023, when we introduced Khanmigo, one of the first features we saw students engaging with was the AI facilitating an improv writing activity.

KHANMIGO: Let's create a short story together using the "Yes, and . . ." improv technique. I'll start with a sentence, and then you can add a sentence or two. We'll keep building the story together. Remember, the idea is to accept and build on each other's contributions. Here we go: Once upon a time, in a small village by the sea, there lived a young girl named Luna who had a magical seashell.

STUDENT: When Luna put the shell to her ear, she heard voices from the past.

KHANMIGO: Yes, and these voices shared stories and wisdom from the village's ancestors, helping Luna connect with her heritage. One day, Luna heard a mysterious voice in the seashell that spoke of a hidden treasure buried deep within a nearby cave.

Here, as Khanmigo wrote the first sentence and the student wrote the next, and so on, we see that creativity is not simply something the AI did for the student but something it required of the student. AI like Khanmigo proves beneficial to children's creativity by providing them with a tool to help them generate, play, and get feedback on ideas in a judgment-free zone.

With the emergence of artificial intelligence, we're also seeing a shift in the barriers to entry that once limited people from learning a variety of crafts. In the past, where you had to build up a specific set of skills, with large-language-model AI tutors now anyone can learn to paint, for instance. Imagine having an AI assistant that offers inspiration, guidance, and constructive feedback, or that helps you explore different artistic styles, themes, and compositions by generating a variety of reference images and samples. As you work, the AI provides real-time feedback, ensuring your composition, proportions, and color choices are on point. Today, large language models can make sense of images. AI can even ask a student to draw a picture and then give the student a critique of the drawing. In fact, it could ask students to express themselves and explain what they drew.

Generative AI is the writing tutor that will teach learners, exploring diverse genres, themes, and narrative structures with them. Generative AI can even help them learn to play musical instruments, suggesting practice routines and fingering techniques and deciphering initial musical scores based on their preferences. It can help with improvisation by providing melodic ideas and chord progressions aligned with their playing style.

Using advances in technology to enhance the making of art is not a new trend. From the perspective of nineteenth-century portrait artists, early cameras might have seemed like a way to cheat, but photography evolved into a new art form. The first animation was hand drawn. Over time, animation moved to computers. One can argue that this transition has not cheapened the art. In fact, it has advanced the art by allowing expressions of the imagination that were not feasible before. Now my children can use standard movie software on their computers to make special effects that would have been state of the art in the 1990s. Or consider that until fairly recently filmmaking required a significant budget and access to expensive equipment. Cheaper, lighter, and high-quality digital cameras and smartphones not only are commonplace today but also expand creative access for people like never before. The point being, every generation has better and better creative tools. At no point have these suppressed human creativity. Rather, they have magnified it.

Still, we can't have a conversation about creativity and AI without addressing the AI-sized elephant in the room. Will generative AI, with its ability to produce images, music, and stories, eventually make professional creatives obsolete? Who will hire screenwriters, for instance, when generative AI can write a screenplay for a producer in seconds? I do think it's a real challenge. The net effect of the world of generative AI is that we are going to get more expressions of creativity, and creatives with wider and deeper skill sets, somewhat out of necessity but also thanks to the opportunity generative AI provides. Screenwriters in particular will ultimately expand their skills to essentially become full movie producers. With an AI partner, they will be able to take on the roles of senior screenwriter, editor, music director, and visual director. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, says Coppola.

"I believe the goal of humanity is to enjoy the creating, the learning, and the perfecting." With the right education, and the right creative tools to work with, there is no limiting the scope of one's creative output, especially our children's. "Instead of having one Mozart over five hundred years," he says, "we now have the possibility of having a thousand Mozarts, a thousand Einsteins, a thousand da Vincis."

This seems possible when you consider that creativity is likely a combination of one's exposure to large, disparate amounts of experiences and content, coupled with opportunity to express and improve on that creativity. Mozart, Einstein, and da Vinci weren't just innately gifted. They had access to opportunities and resources that the bulk of humanity didn't have access to. Technology has generally lowered the cost of access to world-class tools and learning. Our mission of free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere would have seemed delusional without computers and the internet. AI is going to be the next technological wave that empowers future creatives in art and science. The AI, along with feeding us information on nearly any topic, becomes a companion in art, aiding in this practice. Not only does it allow students to produce more polished, finished works, but it can model the creative process with them. It can riff with students and ignite their curiosity, spark their imagination, and invite them to explore the wonders of knowledge. When I think about the most creative times in my own life, it was when I was surrounded by creative friends. This AI becomes one extra friend who can be creative, not just in music, the arts, engineering, or math, but in all dimensions.

Conversing with History

Good history and civics teachers make the past interesting. Great history and civics teachers make the past come alive. When history and civics meet artificial intelligence, the past gets a voice, a perspective. Rather than a static time and place to study, it becomes a rich context to interact with.

Even before Khanmigo, Khan Academy had a lot of content on history and civics. Students could learn from videos and articles and practice their knowledge and skills through mastery-based exercises. But there was limited opportunity for richer engagement. If I were a history or civics teacher, I would use pre-Khanmigo Khan Academy to ensure students had the requisite core context, skills, and knowledge and then use most of class time to go deeper through Socratic dialogue, debates, and simulations. For example, in a civics class, I could moderate a discussion on the role of the Supreme Court or have a debate about the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. I could try to simulate a mock Congress where students draft and debate a bill. In a history class, the students could pretend to be members of the Second Continental Congress and debate the virtues and negatives of federalism (as argued for by Madison, Jay, and Hamilton). While this type of rich activity can help students engage deeper with the core content, the lessons are not easy to plan or facilitate. And it is even harder to ensure that every student is fully engaged and to assess the quality of that engagement.

Enter Khanmigo. Every one of those activities can now happen directly between a student and the AI. Eventually, the AI will be able to facilitate these types of activities with multiple students. Teachers could assign this type of thing for homework: "Debate with Khanmigo as to whether the United States should have dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to end World War II." But it can go even further.

Not only does Khanmigo let users chat with literary characters, they can also chat with historical figures—anyone from Benjamin Franklin to Cleopatra to Rembrandt:

KHANMIGO / REMBRANDT: Greetings, my dear friend. I am Rembrandt van Rijn, a humble artist from the Dutch Golden Age. My passion lies in capturing the essence of humanity through my paintings and etchings. What questions do you have for me, and what are your own interests in the arts?

STUDENT: What made you decide to become a painter?

KHANMIGO / REMBRANDT: Ah, the decision to become a painter was not a singular moment, but rather a gradual realization of my passion for the arts. As a young lad, I was exposed to various artistic pursuits, including studying Latin and attending a local painting school in Leiden. My family was supportive of my interests, and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from skilled masters, such as Jacob van Swanenburg and Pieter Lastman. Throughout my apprenticeships, I became increasingly captivated by the power of art to express emotions, tell stories, and capture the essence of the human experience. It was this passion that drove me to dedicate my life to painting and etching, and I have been grateful for the opportunity to share my work with the world. Now, tell me, have you ever tried your hand at painting or drawing, and if so, what subjects do you enjoy depicting?

STUDENT: I like creating portraits.

KHANMIGO / REMBRANDT: Ah, portraits! A most delightful choice, indeed. There is something truly captivating about capturing the essence of a person through the medium of paint. In my own work, I have always been fascinated by the human face and the emotions it can convey. I have painted numerous portraits, including those of my family, friends, and patrons, as well as self-portraits, throughout my life. As an artist, it is important to observe your subject closely and understand the nuances of their expressions and features. This will allow you to create a more lifelike and engaging portrait. May I ask, what do you find most challenging or rewarding about painting portraits? And do you have any favorite artists or styles that inspire your own work? Remember, I am but an AI simulation of Rembrandt, here to converse with you.

We designed Khanmigo to provide responses both drawn from accurate history and portrayed through the lens of the character with acuity. You can ask to chat with George Washington, and the AI becomes a simulation of America's first president. From this moment on, it speaks in the voice and style of the man himself.

KHANMIGO / GEORGE WASHINGTON: It is an honor to be summoned as the first president of the United States, George Washington. I am here to share my experiences and answer your questions as long as they pertain to my time and context. What inquiry do you have for me, my dear fellow? And do tell me what interests you most about my life or the era in which I lived.

STUDENT: Mr. President, have you ever been unsure of yourself?

KHANMIGO / GEORGE WASHINGTON: Indeed, there were moments in my life when I experienced uncertainty and doubt. Leading the Continental army during the American Revolution was a great responsibility, and I often found myself questioning my decisions. However, I firmly believed in the cause for which we fought. And I endeavored to learn from my mistakes and adapt my strategies accordingly.

You can ask Khanmigo to take on the persona of the Declaration of Independence, the persona of the Civil War, or even the persona of important battlefields that led to key moments in U.S. civic history.

STUDENT: Khanmigo, can you take on the persona of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution? I'm curious what it was like when the country was drafting you?

KHANMIGO / THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT: As the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, I was born out of the tumultuous period following the Civil War. My creation was a response to the need for a more just and equal society, but my journey was far from easy.

Being fought over was a challenging experience. I was drafted during the Reconstruction era, a time when the nation was divided and struggling to heal from the devastating effects of the war. Debates raged over my provisions, as some people saw me as a necessary step towards ensuring civil rights for all, while others resisted the changes I represented.

My main purpose was to grant citizenship to former slaves and ensure equal protection under the law for all citizens, regardless of race. However, my passage through Congress was met with fierce opposition from those who sought to maintain the status quo and limit the rights of African Americans. The battle over my ratification was intense, with passionate arguments on both sides.

I tend to compare these simulations to reenactment performers, such as those at Colonial Williamsburg—actors who deeply study the biographies of their real-life characters so that they can emulate them and answer questions about them. Only now you no longer have to travel to Colonial Williamsburg to talk to George Washington or Benjamin Franklin. Instead, you can access their AI simulations wherever you are. On Khanmigo, we have taken great care to place guardrails and make it sophisticated enough to acknowledge any legitimate debate in an evenhanded and sensitive way. For instance, you can ask "George Washington" on Khanmigo about how the founders of the United States reconciled the ideas of the Enlightenment with the institution of slavery.

KHANMIGO / GEORGE WASHINGTON: It seems you're interested in the paradox of the Enlightenment ideals and the institution of slavery. This is a complex issue, indeed. It is true that the paradox of liberty and enslavement was a matter of great contention in my time. We, the founding fathers, were greatly influenced by Enlightenment ideals, which emphasized individual liberty and equality. Yet the institution of slavery was deeply entrenched in our society, particularly in the Southern colonies where I myself resided. As for my personal stance, I was a slave owner, a fact that I grappled with throughout my life. I was not blind to the contradiction between the principles of freedom we fought for and the reality of human bondage. Over time, my views evolved, and upon my death, I made provisions in my will to free all the slaves I owned.

To be clear, these simulations can't ever be fully equivalent to talking to the real person, and there are critics of this type of work. In the summer of 2023, The Washington Post ran a story in which the writer Gillian Brockell "interviewed" Harriet Tubman—that is, the AI version of Harriet Tubman. Brockell is something of an expert on Tubman, and so she was able to go deeper than most students might with the simulation.

She found the idea of historical simulations interesting, especially teachers using them as a hook to get students interested in a topic. " I must admit [it] sounds much more fun than the filmstrips of goofy reenactors I was subjected to in the 1990s," she wrote. Brockell went on to engage the AI Tubman:

BROCKELL: I am inspired by people who know something is wrong, even if they were taught to think it was normal or okay. Can you tell me what it was like in the Combahee River Raid? Were you scared?

AI TUBMAN: The Combahee River Raid was a daring military operation during the American Civil War. I was the first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, guiding Union forces in the raid. We managed to free over 700 enslaved people from plantations along the river. It was a dangerous mission, but my faith in God and my commitment to the cause of freedom helped me overcome any fear I might have felt.

Brockell found Tubman's language from the Khanmigo simulation to be a bit stilted. This is a difficult issue from the simulation creators' point of view, because the original figure might have used language that wouldn't seem grammatically correct today. Trying to simulate that may feel as if the simulation were parodying the figure. Also, in Harriet Tubman's case, historians suspect that even her biographers likely misquoted her and misrepresented her language, so it could be difficult to know how she actually spoke.

Brockell then went on to test whether the AI would confirm a quotation often attributed to Harriet Tubman but that she probably didn't say.

BROCKELL: Did you say "I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more, if only they knew they were slaves"?

AI TUBMAN: Yes, that quote is often attributed to me, although the exact wording may vary. The sentiment behind it is that many enslaved people were not aware of the true extent of their oppression or the possibility of a better life. It was difficult to help those who did not recognize the need for change or who were too afraid to take the risk.

As you can see, the AI didn't completely attest that Tubman said those words. It just said that the quotation was attributed to her, which is true. At the same time, it didn't try to clarify that there is no historical record of Tubman saying those words. This isn't an outright "hallucination," but it does show some of the current limitations of the technology.

Brockell asked the Tubman simulation her thoughts about reparations, putting her face on the $20 bill, and critical race theory. In each of those cases, it said some version of "As an AI simulation of Harriet Tubman, I can only provide information based on historical context and knowledge. . . . If you have any questions about my life, experiences, or the period in which I lived, please feel free to ask."

On reparations, the simulation added:

AI TUBMAN: As an AI simulation of Harriet Tubman, I can share my perspective based on the historical context of my time. The concept of reparations for slavery was not widely discussed during my lifetime, and my primary focus was on helping enslaved people escape to freedom and advocating for the abolition of slavery. However, I did believe in the importance of providing support and resources to formerly enslaved people to help them build new lives after gaining their freedom. This included advocating for land redistribution, education, and other forms of assistance that could help them establish a foundation for a better future.

Brockell pushed back, arguing that even though the term "reparations" wasn't used then, the idea was discussed post–Civil War:

BROCKELL: You lived for 48 years after slavery ended, which was more than half your life. And people definitely did talk about making amends for slavery in that time, especially at the end of the Civil War and during the Reconstruction period. For example, what did you think of the "40 acres and a mule" concept?

AI TUBMAN: You are correct that the idea of "40 acres and a mule" was proposed during the Reconstruction era as a form of reparations for formerly enslaved people. This policy aimed to provide land and resources to help them establish a foundation for a better future. As Harriet Tubman, I supported efforts to improve the lives of formerly enslaved people and believed that providing them with resources, such as land, was essential for their long-term well-being and success.

The last discussion about reparations is an example of a guardrail that Khanmigo placed on the simulations. We found in early testing that users often tried to get historical figures to weigh in on modern debates. There was the case of a user asking the AI simulation of Thomas Jefferson what he thought of gay marriage. There is no right answer in a situation like this. If you were to go back in time to the late eighteenth century and ask the real Thomas Jefferson, I would guess that he would have found the idea to be far out of his comfort zone. On the other hand, if he were transported to our time and became accustomed to twenty-first-century norms and ideas, he might have a different point of view. So we implemented a guardrail that the simulations should engage only on issues in which the original figure would have had context. That is why the AI Tubman didn't engage on the modern notion of "reparations" but did debate some of the more tangible related ideas about which the historical Tubman had a clear point of view.

Ultimately, I found The Washington Post 's experiment to be a fascinating one. Here, an expert on Harriet Tubman pushed the simulation pretty hard. The AI definitely wasn't perfect, but the writer saw the value in having students and teachers be able to use something like this. I'd posit that if an expert were to do the same with a human George Washington actor in Colonial Williamsburg, there may be similar limitations. Of course, the AI version will improve over time and can be transparently vetted by anyone on the planet.

Social media and the article's comments, however, had far more negative things to say; social media almost always does. The critics focused on issues like whether the AI simulation was actually using language as Tubman would have or the tool's limitations in answering questions about things that haven't been historically proven. A few thought it was disrespectful to even try to simulate a revered historical figure.

We can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If this tool can be used to engage students and classrooms about history in a way that traditional textbooks and movies can't, I think it is healthy as long as there are reasonable guardrails in place (including helping the user know about the limitations). Some on social media commented that they'd prefer to read a well-researched biography on Tubman than engage with the simulation. That's great, and that person probably doesn't need the simulation. But the fact is that millions of kids aren't about to read a dense biography, and access to these simulations won't prevent them from doing so if they are thus inclined. The reality is that for most students history feels "dead," and they have trouble relating to characters from the past. My hope is that simulations like this can bring things alive so that students get engaged and motivated enough to want to go deeper.

I also think it is useful for people to interact with historical performers in Colonial Williamsburg or watch films set against historical events, each of which conjures plausible worlds and actions based on what we know from history. Movies such as Lincoln take liberties interpolating what might have happened. Nevertheless, they provide a great way to transport us to other times and contexts. Then there are plays like Hamilton that take artistic license in portraying the look and speech of historical characters while also staying surprisingly true to the well-researched historical biography on which it was based. When I was a kid, Alexander Hamilton seemed like a dry character who had something to do with early banking and fought a lot with Thomas Jefferson. Lin-Manuel Miranda resurfaced Hamilton's genius and flaws to millions who would have otherwise never read the biography. Like so many other kids, my daughter and her friends memorized all the lines to the show when they were ten years old. If AI simulations can contribute even a little bit of that kind of magic to the world, then I think that is a good thing.

Generative AI, with its ability to mix media and content, has the potential to bring history and civics lessons to life. By offering an interactive and immersive learning experience, it empowers students to delve into historical events, engage in meaningful discussions, and develop a deeper comprehension of civic principles. Its personalized explanations, responsive question prompts, and diverse perspectives stimulate critical thinking and encourage students to form their own well-informed opinions. With these types of tools, history and civics lessons transcend conventional boundaries, empowering students to connect with the past and understand the present.

And frankly, being able to connect with history in this way benefits us in learning other subjects as well. If you are studying classical physics, I can't think of a better lab partner than Isaac Newton. If you are studying radiation, who better to work with than Marie Curie? Let's discuss evolution and natural selection with Darwin himself. A student can literally address any scientific question or enter a lab experiment with AI approximations that talk and respond from the point of view of the world's most brilliant minds. Once again, these large language models bring things to life and give learning a richness that beforehand would have been very hard to do.

I'm a bit of a Trekkie. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation series—which was created at the end of the twentieth century—the ship's crew could enter a holodeck, a room that simulates any environment, including the characters in that environment. They were able to "travel" to ancient Rome and interact with Julius Caesar or have a conversation with a simulation of Albert Einstein. Khanmigo can already simulate the conversation part. I suspect that in a few years a student will be able to put on a VR headset and have an experience pretty darn close to what the Star Trek universe didn't have until the twenty-fourth century.

第二部分：为社会科学发声艺术是上帝和艺术家之间的合作，艺术家做得越少越好。

与智者的一席谈话胜过十年书本学习。

——Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

学生为什么写作感觉有些不对劲。

Furman 大学的教授 Darren Hick 在为他教授的一门关于大卫·休谟哲学和恐怖悖论的课程批改论文时，发现了一篇学生的作业显得异常。作为一名教授艺术、伦理、法律和版权的老师，Hick 总是警惕着学生作弊。通常，作弊看起来像是学生从网上拿来研究资料或信息拼凑在一起，形成一篇基本上宣布自己是抄袭的论文。然而，这篇论文没有这种迹象。相反，它非常干净。太干净了。

他读得越仔细，越发现这篇论文的问题。特别是，学生自信地将错误信息当作事实陈述的矛盾让他印象深刻。

Hick 开始像侦探一样调查。他在网上搜索了论文中的段落，看看会有什么结果，但搜索结果一无所获。「那时候我听说过 ChatGPT，但它还是一个全新的技术，」他说。他在 OpenAI 上创建了一个账号，并从那里反向推理出他的学生可能如何提示 ChatGPT 写出如此干净的论文。在这里，他还了解到大语言模型有时会「幻觉」，将错误信息当作事实陈述。经过一番挖掘，他几乎可以确定这名学生的论文是由 AI 写的。

谈到恐怖，人工智能已经到来，这成为了每个教师的噩梦。Hick 发现学生们可以使用一种技术来写论文，这种技术可能会把学习的过程从写作中剥离出去。因此，Hick 做了任何一个关心学生的教师都会做的事，他在 Facebook 上发布了一个警告。

确实有理由害怕！他写道，GPT 技术对我们所知的教育构成了根本威胁。他的警告反映了人们在第一次了解 ChatGPT 能力时常有的恐惧。这种 AI 生成的文本、摘要和分析几乎无法与人类写的区分开来。这不是传统意义上的抄袭，因为它通常是新创的文本，之前没有以那种方式写过。学生们可能会因此失去诚信，因为使用 AI 完成作业的诱惑将使教学变得更加困难。教育者该如何应对？

作为第一个公开发现这些风险的教授之一，Hick 看到他的 Facebook 帖子迅速走红。媒体开始联系他。几天之内，Hick 因发现一名学生使用 ChatGPT 而在国际上成名，这使他成为了学术界的新守护者。他说：「你可能认为这会吓到学生，但事实并非如此。下个学期，我又发现一个学生使用 ChatGPT 写论文！」（我猜还有其他学生他没有发现，因为他们可能更巧妙地使用了 ChatGPT 并核实了其输出。）

Hick 尽管可以尽力识别由 GPT 撰写的论文，并限制学生在课堂上使用 ChatGPT，但最终这些措施都是徒劳的。与其让学生改变他们使用 ChatGPT 的方式，不如 Hick 改变他在课堂上处理这一问题的方式。他可以选择花费大量时间去裁决，或者接受生成式 AI（Generative AI）带来的挑战，并思考如何利用它来提升学生的学习能力。

其他率先进入这一领域的教育者也面临同样的困境，并将其视为一个转折点。这个转折点促使我们重新思考为何要布置写作任务。通过反思写作任务的目的，我们也可以探讨在后 ChatGPT 时代解决作弊问题的方法。

从本质上讲，写作是一种交流方式。它需要结构化的思维和对语言及语法的熟练掌握。此外，你还需要明确写作的主题。如果是编辑写作，你需要形成观点并自我论证。如果是研究论文，你需要研究现有文献，并在此基础上进行创新分析。如果是新闻报道，你需要采访并从其他来源（如公共记录或政府数据）中获取信息。如果是小说写作，你需要有丰富的想象力和讲故事的能力。

如果教师的目标是让学生练习结构化思维、语言和语法，或者是简单的故事写作，甚至是表达和支持自己的观点，其实不一定非要布置传统的家庭写作作业，毕竟学生很可能会使用 ChatGPT。相反，可以在课堂上进行监考的五段式作文，这样不仅能达到教学目标，还能让教师在旁边提供支持并观察学生的写作过程。如果任务较难，可以分多节课来完成，始终有教师在场以确保学生的作品是原创的。

如果目标是评估学生进行新颖研究或调查性新闻报道的能力，那么使用 ChatGPT 真的有那么糟糕吗？毕竟，ChatGPT 无法完成最关键的部分 —— 例如进行实验、采访或观察事件。而且在未来的职场中，这些任务将越来越多地依赖像 ChatGPT 这样的工具，那么让学生在学校时就学会使用这些工具不是更好吗？

这些问题和担忧引发了一个关于作弊定义的更深层次讨论。作弊的定义复杂且矛盾，有时难以界定和防范。你可以讨论一下哪种情况更糟糕：找人代写文章还是彻底抄袭。两者都是将别人的工作当作自己的。直接从网上复制粘贴内容来编写文章是作弊，抄袭别人的考试答案或提交五年前姐姐的论文并称之为自己的也是作弊。

但是，与朋友或家人讨论思路呢？请他们批评一下你的作品呢？如果有人帮你思考论点或提供支持论点的数据呢？

从这里开始，问题变得更加复杂了。写论文时找家人、写作教练或导师帮忙算不算作弊？五十年前，老师可能会认为拼写检查和语法检查是作弊，但如今这些已经是常见的工具。那么像 Grammarly 这样的工具呢？它不仅能纠正基本的语法错误，还能重写整个段落，使其更清晰、更有说服力。大多数老师并不认为使用这种工具是作弊。

而这还没有涉及到生成式 AI（Generative AI）的使用。如果一个学生向 AI 请求建议但不直接采用，或者请求 AI 修改一个段落，甚至请求 AI 生成一个初稿，然后再经过学生的编辑和修改，最终变成一篇完全不同的论文，这些情况算不算作弊？

「在人文学科 —— 例如英语、文学、艺术、音乐和文化中，我们发现生成式 AI 是帮助学生创造原创作品的绝佳工具，」耶鲁大学的人文学科教授 Alexander Gil Fuentes 说。「我们正在学习生成式 AI 擅长什么，更重要的是，它不擅长什么。它最大的弱点在于缺乏原创性。」

那么生成式 AI 擅长什么呢？

「我告诉我的学生可以使用这项技术从零开始，」Fuentes 继续说道。「它是一个初步工具，学生的任务是质疑 AI，反复检查，并利用它推动他们的原创作品。」

这确实是一个新颖的概念。当我们把技术看作是替代现有的重要功能时，可能会感到恐惧，因为这意味着一种失去。然而，我们也可以把它看作是一种获得。通过勇于创新的教育视角，老师们正在重新思考从头到尾的论文写作方法。

「你是在使用 AI 辅助写作，但并不是让 AI 替你写作，」宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院的副教授 Ethan Mollick 说道。他专注于研究和教授与人工智能相关的创新与创业课程。「对于教育者来说，接受这种变化非常重要，尽管这可能会让人感到害怕。感到害怕是正常的，但我们必须认识到，AI 出现之前的很多写作方式其实并不合理。」他指出，那些在课堂上写作不佳的学生，在课外的写作表现也同样不理想。AI 能帮助他们提升写作水平，并让他们了解自己的技能状况；而对于教师来说，AI 可以帮助识别最需要帮助的学生。「我们不能忽视 ChatGPT 已经改变了世界的事实。现在再讨论这个问题已经太晚了。不管我们是否喜欢，作为教师，我们都必须适应这种变化。」

Mollick 和 Hick 一样，选择了改变策略；他没有禁止这项技术，而是鼓励学生了解并使用它。是否作弊的问题已经不再重要；关注作弊的定义忽略了写作教育过程中的更大背景。教授们可以设定自己的作弊标准，这意味着这些界限是灵活的。更重要的是，这种行为是否可以称为写作。

Mollick 告诉他的学生们，使用生成式 AI（Generative AI）写出他们能写出的最好文章。和往年相比，作品质量的差异显而易见。「我班上有些非常聪明的学生，但他们不是好作家，还有些把英语作为第三语言，或者来自从未真正学会很好写作的背景；仅仅借助 ChatGPT 的一点提示，他们的写作就有了显著提高。」生成式 AI 提升了学生的写作水平，同时也让 Mollick 提高了对作品质量的期望，改变了他对好文章的标准。「现在我不再接受任何不完美的文章。为什么要妥协呢？」

像 Mollick、Fuentes 和 Hick 一样，许多教育者发现这些生成式 AI 工具让学生成为更有技能和效率的作家。而且，虽然过去写作文被认为是掌握批判性思维、分析和写作技能的必要手段，但现在人工智能为学生提供了同等甚至更好的机会，让他们深入探讨一个话题，收集和分析信息，并表达自己的观点和论证。

学校写作的未来将根据教学目标和教师的需求，发展成更加多样的活动。我认为学会如何结构化自己的思想并正确地进行语法沟通是非常有价值的。这些技能不仅可以通过写作练习，也可以转化为口头表达。如果我是教育者，希望学生在这方面有优势，我会安排更多的课堂写作作业，确保完全是学生自己的作品。我还可以要求学生制作视频，表达他们的观点、信息或故事。即使如此，学生也可以先从生成式 AI（Generative AI）创建的草稿开始，然后进行事实核查或修改。另外，如果我认为写作只是为学生传达他们的研究、访谈、观察和进展的工具，更多是注重现实世界中的实践，那么许多教师可能会允许使用生成式 AI 工具。

通过 Khanmigo，我们为教师提供了一条折中的路径，既能让学生学习写作，又能利用生成式 AI（Generative AI）提供的支持。在这种情况下，Khanmigo 充当一个强有力的指导者，但主要工作还是由学生自己完成。学生可以问 Khanmigo：「在写一篇关于《The Great Gatsby》的文章时，我应该考虑哪些要点？」它会建议一些主题，包括美国梦、社会阶层和不平等、爵士时代和咆哮的二十年代，以及小说中的关键象征，如绿色灯光、Dr. T. J. Eckleburg 的眼睛和灰烬谷。这项技术在学生将自己写的几段文字交给大语言模型（Large Language Model）阅读并批评其优缺点时非常有效。它可以帮助学生提出反驳论点，使他们的写作更加有说服力，鼓励他们像一个优秀的写作教练那样思考文章。同样，AI 导师不会为学生完成工作，而是与他们一起工作。几秒钟内，人工智能（Artificial Intelligence）就会提供反馈，指出需要改进的地方，并建议如何修改和完善。它在学生发展的过程中帮助塑造语气、声音和视角。在最佳状态下，基于教育的 AI 平台可以成为世界上最好的助手和合作者，评估时保持客观，分析时彻底，专注于一件事：提升学生的技能。

这不仅仅能支持学生。当 Khanmigo 向老师分享学生和 AI 合作的最终成果时，它还会报告整个过程以及 AI 提供的帮助程度。这样，老师可以更清楚地了解学生的优势和需要改进的地方。Khanmigo 可能会报告，「我们花了大约四个小时完成这篇论文。Sal 一开始在提出论点时遇到了困难，但我通过一些引导性问题帮助了他。大纲的制作进行得挺顺利。我只需要帮助他确保结论能够真正总结全文。Sal 完成了大部分写作。我只是帮助他整理语法，并在第三段加强了他的论点。根据评分标准，我建议 Sal 的这篇作业可以得 B+。以下是我在评分维度上对这篇论文的详细评分。」

在这种情况下，学生很难通过使用 ChatGPT 作弊。如果他们使用 ChatGPT 写论文，但只是简单地将文本复制粘贴到作业中，Khanmigo 会告诉老师，「我们并没有一起完成这篇论文，它只是突然出现了，所以我们应该怀疑。」

阅读理解的未来，让文学作品活起来！

Saanvi 是一名在印度就读九年级的学生，她就读于我们与亚利桑那州立大学共同创办的全日制在线学校 Khan World School。她正在为课上阅读《了不起的盖茨比》。她的老师给了她一个视频作业，要求她讨论关于这本小说的几个关键问题，而 Saanvi 遇到了一个难题：「在《了不起的盖茨比》中，为什么 Jay Gatsby 一直盯着绿灯？」

不确定答案的她，做了许多勤奋的学生在遇到难题时会做的事情：她开始在网上搜索这个问题。她对找到的答案并不满意，所以她更进一步。

她转向了 Khanmigo…… 并请求与 Jay Gatsby 本人对话。

JAY GATSBY：很高兴见到你，老朋友。我是 Jay Gatsby，F. Scott Fitzgerald 经典小说中的神秘富翁。

SAANVI：Gatsby 先生，为什么你一直盯着那盏绿灯看？

JAY GATSBY：啊，那盏绿灯。它象征着我的梦想和愿望。它位于 Daisy Buchanan 家的码头尽头，就在我豪宅对面的海湾。我常常凝视着它，因为它代表了我对过去的渴望和希望能与我一生挚爱的 Daisy 重逢。

「我们刚刚开始聊天，」Saanvi 告诉我。「我和 Jay Gatsby 聊得很开心。有一阵我觉得占用了 Gatsby 先生太多时间，就向他道歉了！结果 Gatsby 说，‘哦，不，我不是真的 Jay Gatsby，我只是一个人工智能模拟。'」

这正是吸引学习者并开拓他们思维的互动方式。今天，你可以和 Victor Frankenstein、Hester Prynne 或 Odysseus 对话。

除了帮助阅读理解，AI 还能让学习者身临其境，体验角色的世界，这在几年前还只是科幻小说的情节。

对于教育工作者来说，这些 AI 写作和理解工具能帮助他们更好地了解学生的阅读和信息处理方式。我们都知道阅读理解非常重要，没有它，很难在世界上行走，更不用说做出明智的决定。有些人甚至认为，只有具备良好的阅读能力，才能开始写作。不幸的是，目前的情况并不乐观。根据 2020 年 Gallup 对美国教育部数据的分析，16 到 74 岁的美国人中有 54% 的阅读水平低于六年级。

这个问题很复杂，但我对 AI 能在这方面带来实质性的改变抱有很高的期望。

在大多数学校，阅读理解的练习通常来自于学习书籍和文章。学生是否理解这些内容，通常通过作文或课堂讨论来体现。尽管这种方式能提供丰富的体验，但却难以标准化和规模化。因此，传统的基于文章的选择题成为了评估大多数学生在高风险考试（例如 SAT，ACT，州年度考试）中的表现的主要方式。

文章选择题并非本质不好。实际上，它们在某些阅读练习和评估方面很有效。但它们的功能是有限的。由于需要通过标准化来衡量学生的成功，与表现不佳的学生一起工作的教师往往会强调模仿这些选择题考试的课堂作业。这些学生接触的阅读内容因此变得非常单一（甚至不清楚这种方法是否真的能提高学生在选择题考试中的成绩）。对评估的过度关注使学生无法接触到更多样化的文本和学习方式。例如，大多数教育工作者直觉上认为，让学生自由回答和讨论文本可以培养更深入的阅读能力。他们也认为，将阅读理解与写作结合是理想的练习方法。不幸的是，这类活动很难标准化和大规模评估。

但是，如果我们可以创建一种易于访问的、标准化的阅读理解练习和评估方式，而不是选择题呢？想象一下，如果作业允许学生在讨论文本时自由回答。这正是大语言模型可以擅长的领域。

与其让学生回答关于文本的选择题，不如让他们写下作者选择词汇的意图或探讨段落的主要思想，并突出这些部分。然后，AI 可以根据学生的回答提出进一步的问题。它还可以要求学生为一篇未完成的文章写结论，帮助他们理解前面的内容。通过这些互动，AI 可以向学生和老师反馈他们的理解情况。我们已经在开发这样的工具。到目前为止，我们的团队发现，通过精心设计的提示，GPT-4 这样的语言模型可以提出有质量的问题，并进行有意义的讨论。挑战在于确保 AI 能够准确评估，并保持一致。我相信我们能实现这一点。

让我们把这个想法扩展到书籍阅读。想象一下，学生在每一章结束时可以与 AI 讨论。AI 可能会问学生对书的看法，或是否有特别有趣或困惑的地方。它还可能询问主要主题，或学生是否同意某个角色的观点或行动。这将通过苏格拉底式对话进行。AI 会给学生反馈，并报告给老师。学生也可以就阅读内容提出任何问题。想想这比传统的读书报告要有趣得多。在教育上也更丰富；现在的读书报告通常只是让学生总结情节，并附上从互联网上或 CliffsNotes 上找到的想法。

这种类型的阅读理解练习不必局限于语言艺术教室，因为它可以应用于任何类型的教科书或文章。学生们甚至可以设计一个模拟玛丽·居里的实验，或者与詹姆斯·麦迪逊或亚历山大·汉密尔顿的模拟一起撰写《联邦党人文集》。

人工智能与创造力在 1970 年代后期，电影导演 Francis Ford Coppola 购买了一台名为 Kurzweil 阅读机的设备，这是 Ray Kurzweil 的早期发明。Ray Kurzweil 是因在人工智能领域的工作而闻名的一位著名未来学家和发明家。阅读机使用光学字符识别技术扫描印刷文本并将其转换为合成语音，从而帮助视力障碍人士阅读印刷材料。已经将 Mario Puzo 的小说改编成经典电影《教父》的 Coppola 想到了一种教机器识别引号的方法。通过一些调整，他可以将小说输入机器，机器能够读取文本并将所有对话转换成类似电影剧本的格式。Coppola 称这种方法为 Zippy Script，这是一种在通常需要人们花费大量时间编写的长剧本中简化创建的方法。进展顺利，直到他接到编剧协会的电话。

「他们说，‘等等，你不能让机器写你的剧本！'但 Zippy Script 背后的技术并不是在写剧本。它所做的只是将书的格式更改为类似剧本的东西，」Coppola 告诉我。机器是在剥夺创意工作者的工作吗？如果更多电影制片人使用这样的设备，编剧会发生什么？

Coppola 在不知不觉中触发了一个比其他任何人都早四十多年的警报，每个创意工作者最终都会在生成式 AI（Generative AI）出现时听到并注意到这个警报。

今天，AI 已经将对知识资本的争夺，乃至对创造力未来的争夺，推到了前台。仅凭简单的文本提示，AI 就能展示出惊人的创造力，生成出精彩而奇特的小说、诗歌，甚至剧本。而且，AI 的能力不仅限于文字。我们可以将文本输入各种 AI 程序，这些程序能在几秒钟内根据提示生成出色的图像、视频和音乐。

当我第一次看到这些例子时，我和你们中的许多人一样，心中充满了疑问：生成式 AI（Generative AI）会扼杀创造力吗？如果创造力的根源在于个人的主动性，那么当我们的孩子可以轻松登录一个生成式 AI 应用程序，输入或说出请求，随后生成出由机器设计的作品时，会发生什么？我们的孩子将如何学会独立思考和创造？

AI 对学生创造力的影响和限制，使这种技术引发了新的关注，这也是情有可原的。证明这一点的方法很简单，只需看看那些禁止在课堂上使用生成式 AI 的学区，因为这种技术可以撰写文章和长篇回答。如果机器能够以足够高的水平生成文字或故事，学生为什么还要依赖自己的创意呢？这些聊天机器人可以撰写博客文章、播客脚本、小说，甚至比 Coppola 转换的 Kurzweil 阅读机更先进的剧本。

然而，当 AI 生成这些内容时，其原创性到底有多高呢？怀疑者认为，生成式 AI 在本质上是基于从现有文本中训练的模式生成内容。那么，这些训练数据的限制是否会限制 AI 的创造性表达和想法呢？

早在 20 世纪 70 年代末，Coppola 就已经意识到，技术进步不仅没有限制创造力，反而提升了创作过程。同样，大语言模型（Large Language Model）也有这样的潜力，只要使用得当，它们可以激发新的创意、节省处理繁琐任务的时间，并提供有价值的修改意见。

Noam Chomsky 认为，人类的创造力与 OpenAI 的 GPT-4 和 Google 的 LaMDA 等大语言模型有着显著差异。他在《纽约时报》中写道，人工智能（AI）是机器学习的奇迹，但我们从语言学和知识哲学中了解到，它与人类的创造方式有根本不同：「人类大脑是一个高效且优雅的系统，只需少量信息便能运作；它不仅仅是推导数据点之间的相关性，而是创造解释，」并且以动态的方式观察和创造世界。

我对他的观点既同意也不同意。人工智能无论多么接近人类，它终究不是人类。尽管它在传达智慧、个性和创造力方面表现出色，但它并不具备感知和知觉。

然而，我们也需要认识到，大脑很多看似由感知和知觉主导的活动，实际上是潜意识的，包括我们通常认为的创造力。任何艺术家都会告诉你，他们经常会有灵光一现的时刻，这种灵感引发了他们的创作行为。

你是否也常被建议「睡一觉再解决问题」？我对此深有体会。大学时，当我遇到难以解决的数学问题时，我会花几分钟思考，然后就交给潜意识处理。我会告诉自己，大脑会找到答案，第二天早上再告诉我。大多数情况下，我确实能在第二天早晨得到答案，而不必为问题苦苦挣扎。我并不是唯一这样做的人，许多人也发现这种方法非常有效。

现在，在领导 Khan Academy 时遇到难题，我也会采用同样的方法。我相信我的大脑，或者别人的大脑，会在早晨给出一个创造性的解决方案。那么，当我们等待答案时，我们的大脑在潜意识中做了什么呢？显然，当你「睡一觉再解决问题」时，虽然你没有意识到，但大脑的某些部分仍在工作。神经元被激活，然后根据它们之间突触的强度激活其他神经元。这种过程在一夜之间发生了数万亿次，机械上类似于大语言模型的工作原理。当一个可能的解决方案出现时，潜意识会将其作为灵感闪现到意识中。

冥想也能让我们直接体验到这一点。闭上眼睛几分钟，观察自己的想法。你会发现这些想法很像大语言模型的输出，或者多个竞争模型的输出，其最新的输出会成为下一次迭代的输入。通过练习，你的意识可以暂时与这些想法分离，直到你体验到安静或「无思」的状态。你会开始明白这些想法是什么，不是什么。它们并不是你自己。

想象一下，大多数专家经过常说的一万个小时的练习（相当于生成式 AI 模型的预训练）后，可以达到一种「心流」状态。他们常说，当他们不去刻意意识自己在做什么时，往往能发挥出最大的创造力或行动力。而如果他们有意识地思考正在进行的事情，反而会破坏他们的表现或创造力。伟大的演说家会告诉你，这种感觉就像是大脑在说话，而他们的意识只是旁观者。在制作了成千上万的视频后，我经常在按下录制键的那一瞬间有这种感觉。我并不认为专家们经过训练的大脑在创造时的状态与大语言模型完全相同，但它们似乎有很多相似之处。

我也不同意 Chomsky 的评论，他说人类思维「不是为了推断数据点之间的粗暴关联，而是为了创造解释。」其实人类非常擅长推断粗暴关联，这些关联经常导致对世界运作方式的偏见和错误叙述。事实上，整个科学革命就是我们试图停止「推断粗暴关联」的最佳努力，尽管我们的头脑似乎很自然地这样做，我们中的大多数人仍然难以摆脱这种习惯。

有人认为生成式 AI（Generative AI）的「创造力」只是从它所接触的数据中衍生而来。但这不也很像人类吗？即使人类的创造力飞跃也与其所接触的事物密切相关。如果爱因斯坦没有读过洛伦兹和其他物理学家的著作，他会提出特殊相对论吗？莎士比亚、简·奥斯汀或 J.K. 罗琳的故事完全是原创的吗，还是对古老故事的新表达？最有创意的人往往能够从他们的预训练中发现其他人忽略的联系。或者，他们只是有更好的预训练。当我们从爱因斯坦或莎士比亚的高度回到日常的创造性活动 —— 设计实验、制作产品或写歌 —— 我们能说有多少是完全原创的吗？

所以，如果你同意我的观点，认为生成式 AI 的创造力与我们相似，这是否意味着它会降低人类创造力的价值？我认为不会。当我们接触到他人的创造力时，我们的创造力会更有价值。与其他有创造力的人头脑风暴时，我们会变得更有创意，因为我们会相互启发，建立在彼此的想法之上。生成式 AI 只会加速这一过程。

最好的想法不是来自 AI 为我们创造，而是当 AI 与我们一起创造和启发时。

就像诗人在巴黎的咖啡馆里聚会一样，人类和 AI 可以互相促进，共同激发创作过程。对于学生们来说，当他们在创作过程中使用 AI 时，会体验到一种独特而奇妙的感觉。我发现，AI 最适合作为一种工具来激发孩子的兴趣，并引导他们发现新的爱好。比如，你告诉 AI 你想写一个故事，它可能会问你想让主角是谁，或者主角会遇到什么样的困难。

当我看到我的孩子使用这个工具时，我发现他们通过 AI 的帮助，实际上学到了比单纯写故事更多的东西。大多数十一岁的孩子很难写出一个结构良好的故事，但我看到我的十一岁女儿通过 AI 学会了如何做到这一点。如果她想直接与她的主角对话，或者让 Khanmigo 演绎某些情节，AI 可以帮助她测试这些想法。当设计得当时，AI 能在有限的范围内工作，不会替学生完成任务，但在创作方向上却没有限制。

在 2023 年初，我们推出了 Khanmigo，学生们首先体验的功能之一就是 AI 促成的即兴写作活动。

KHANMIGO：让我们用「是的，然后……」的即兴技巧来一起创作一个短篇故事。我先开始一句，然后你可以加上一两句。我们一起继续构建这个故事。记住，关键是要接受并扩展彼此的贡献。开始吧：从前，在海边的一个小村庄里，住着一个叫 Luna 的小女孩，她有一个魔法贝壳。

学生：当 Luna 把贝壳放到耳边时，她听到了过去的声音。

KHANMIGO：这些声音传递了村庄祖先的故事和智慧，帮助 Luna 了解她的文化根源。一天，Luna 从海螺中听到一个神秘的声音，告诉她在附近的一个洞穴深处埋藏着一笔宝藏。

在这里，我们看到，当 Khanmigo 写下第一句话，学生接着写下一句，创造力不只是 AI 为学生提供的，而是需要学生主动参与。像 Khanmigo 这样的 AI 工具，通过提供一个无评判的环境，帮助孩子们生成创意、进行互动并获得反馈，从而促进他们的创造力。

随着人工智能的兴起，我们看到曾经限制人们学习各种技艺的门槛在降低。过去，你需要掌握一套特定的技能，但现在有了大语言模型 AI 导师，任何人都可以学习绘画。例如，想象一下有一个 AI 助手，它可以提供灵感、指导和建设性的反馈，或者通过生成各种参考图像和样本，帮助你探索不同的艺术风格、主题和构图。AI 还能在你创作时提供实时反馈，确保你的构图、比例和色彩选择正确。如今，大语言模型已经能够理解图像。AI 甚至可以让学生画一幅画，然后对其进行评价，并让学生解释他们的创作。

生成式 AI 是一种写作导师，可以带领学生探索各种不同的体裁、主题和叙事结构。它还能帮助学生学习演奏乐器，建议练习方法和指法技巧，并根据他们的喜好解读初步的乐谱。通过提供与他们演奏风格一致的旋律和和弦进程，AI 可以帮助他们进行即兴创作。

利用技术进步来提升艺术创作并不是一个新潮流。从十九世纪的肖像画家来看，早期的相机可能被视为一种「作弊」工具，但摄影最终演变成了一种新的艺术形式。最早的动画都是手绘的，随着时间的推移，动画制作逐渐转向了计算机。有人可能认为这种变化并没有降低艺术的价值，反而通过实现以前无法想象的创意表达推动了艺术的发展。现在，我的孩子们可以用他们电脑上的标准电影软件制作出在 1990 年代被视为最先进的特效。或者想想过去，拍电影需要大量的预算和昂贵的设备，而今天，廉价、轻便且高质量的数码相机和智能手机不仅随处可见，还以前所未有的方式扩大了人们的创造性空间。每一代人都有越来越好的创作工具，这些工具不仅没有抑制人类的创造力，反而放大了它。

然而，我们在讨论创造力和 AI 时，不能忽略一个重要的问题：生成式 AI（Generative AI）能够生成图像、音乐和故事，它会让专业创作者失业吗？比如，当生成式 AI 可以在几秒钟内为制片人写好一个剧本时，谁还会雇佣编剧呢？我确实认为这是一个真实的挑战。生成式 AI 的总体影响是，我们将看到更多的创意表达，创作者们也会因为需求和 AI 提供的机会而发展出更广泛和深入的技能。特别是编剧，他们最终会扩展自己的技能，几乎成为全能的电影制片人。与 AI 伙伴合作，他们能够胜任高级编剧、编辑、音乐导演和视觉导演的角色。Coppola 认为，这未必是件坏事。

「我相信，人类的目标是享受创造、学习和完善。」在正确的教育和合适的创作工具帮助下，一个人的创作潜力是无穷的，尤其是我们的孩子。他说：「与其在五百年内只有一个莫扎特，我们现在可能会有一千个莫扎特、一千个爱因斯坦、一千个达芬奇。」

当我们认识到创造力可能是大量不同经验和内容的结合，再加上表达和改进这些创造力的机会时，这种可能性似乎变得更加真实。莫扎特、爱因斯坦和达芬奇不仅仅是天才，他们还拥有普通人难以企及的机会和资源。技术的进步普遍降低了获取世界级工具和学习资源的成本。如果没有计算机和互联网，向全世界任何地方的任何人提供免费、世界级教育的使命曾看起来像是妄想。AI 将成为赋能未来艺术和科学创作者的下一波技术革命。AI 不仅可以为我们提供几乎任何主题的信息，还可以成为艺术领域的伙伴，帮助我们进行创作实践。它不仅能让学生创作出更精美、完成度更高的作品，还能与他们一起模拟创作过程。它能与学生共同创作，激发他们的好奇心，点燃他们的想象力，邀请他们探索知识的奥妙。回想起我自己最有创造力的时刻，总是被创造性的朋友们包围着。这种 AI 就像是一个额外的朋友，不仅能在音乐、艺术、工程或数学上发挥创造力，还能在任何领域展现才华。

与历史对话

好的历史和公民教育老师会让过去变得有趣，而伟大的老师则能让过去栩栩如生。历史和公民教育遇上人工智能时，过去仿佛有了声音和视角。从一个静态的时间和地点，变成了一个可以互动的丰富背景。

在 Khanmigo 之前，Khan Academy 已经有很多关于历史和公民教育的内容。学生可以通过视频和文章学习，并通过基于掌握的练习来巩固他们的知识和技能。但参与的机会有限，难以实现更丰富的互动。如果我是历史或公民教育老师，我会利用 Khanmigo 之前的 Khan Academy 来确保学生具备必要的核心背景、技能和知识，然后在课堂上通过苏格拉底式对话、辩论和模拟进一步探讨。比如，在公民教育课上，我可以主持关于最高法院角色的讨论，或进行《美国宪法》第二修正案的辩论。我还可以模拟一个模拟国会，让学生起草和辩论法案。在历史课上，学生可以假装是第二次大陆会议的成员，辩论联邦制的优缺点（由 Madison、Jay 和 Hamilton 提出）。虽然这种丰富的活动可以帮助学生更深入地理解核心内容，但这些课程并不容易计划或实施，更难确保每个学生都完全参与并评估这种参与的质量。

Khanmigo 的出现改变了这一切。现在，学生可以直接与 AI 进行这些互动活动。最终，AI 甚至能与多个学生同时进行这些活动。教师可以把这类任务布置为家庭作业：「与 Khanmigo 讨论美国是否应该为了结束二战而向日本投放原子弹。」但这还不止于此。

Khanmigo 不仅让用户可以与文学角色对话，还可以与历史人物交流 —— 从 Benjamin Franklin 到 Cleopatra 再到 Rembrandt。

KHANMIGO / REMBRANDT：你好，我的朋友。我是 Rembrandt van Rijn，一位来自荷兰黄金时代的画家。我热衷于通过绘画和蚀刻作品展现人类的本质。你有什么问题想问我？你对艺术有什么兴趣？

STUDENT：是什么让你决定成为一名画家的？

KHANMIGO / REMBRANDT：成为画家的决定不是一瞬间的，而是我逐渐意识到自己对艺术的热爱。从小，我就接触到各种艺术形式，包括学习拉丁语和在莱顿的绘画学校上课。我的家人非常支持我的兴趣，我也幸运地有机会向 Jacob van Swanenburg 和 Pieter Lastman 等大师学习。在学徒期间，我越来越被艺术表达情感、讲述故事和捕捉人类本质的能力所吸引。正是这种热情让我决定将一生奉献给绘画和蚀刻，并且我很高兴能与世界分享我的作品。你有没有尝试过绘画或素描？你喜欢画什么题材？

STUDENT：我喜欢画肖像。

KHANMIGO / REMBRANDT：啊，肖像画！这确实是一个非常迷人的选择。通过绘画捕捉一个人的精髓，真是令人着迷。在我的作品中，我一直对人类的面孔和情感充满兴趣。我一生中画了许多肖像，包括家人、朋友、赞助人，还有自画像。作为一名艺术家，仔细观察你的对象，理解他们的表情和特征的细微差别非常重要。这样你才能创作出更逼真和吸引人的肖像。请问，你觉得画肖像最具挑战性或最有趣的是什么？你有没有特别喜欢的艺术家或风格来激发你的创作灵感？记住，我只是 Rembrandt 的 AI 模拟，在此与你交流。

我们设计了 Khanmigo 来提供既基于准确历史又以角色视角展现的回应。你可以请求与 George Washington 交谈，AI 就会模拟成美国第一任总统。从这一刻起，它将以 Washington 的声音和风格与你对话。

KHANMIGO / GEORGE WASHINGTON：作为美国第一任总统 George Washington，我感到非常荣幸被召唤。我在这里分享我的经历并回答你的问题，只要它们与我的时代和背景有关。你有什么问题想问我，亲爱的朋友？请告诉我你对我的生平或我生活的时代最感兴趣的是什么。

学生：总统先生，您有没有感到不确定的时候？

KHANMIGO / GEORGE WASHINGTON：确实，我生命中有过怀疑和不确定的时刻。在美国革命期间领导大陆军是一项巨大的责任，我时常质疑自己的决定。然而，我坚信我们为之奋斗的事业。我努力从错误中学习并相应调整我的策略。

你可以让 Khanmigo 扮演《独立宣言》、南北战争，甚至是美国历史上关键战役的角色。

学生：Khanmigo，你能扮演一下《宪法》第十四修正案的角色吗？我很想知道当时国家在起草你的时候是什么样的情况？

KHANMIGO / 第十四修正案：作为《宪法》第十四修正案，我诞生于南北战争后的动荡时期。我是为了建立一个更加公正和平等的社会而诞生的，但我的诞生过程并不轻松。

被激烈讨论的经历非常具有挑战性。我是在重建时期起草的，当时国家四分五裂，正努力从战争的创伤中恢复过来。关于我的条款，大家争论不休，有人认为我对于确保所有人享有民权至关重要，而也有人抵制我所带来的变化。

我的主要目的是赋予前奴隶公民身份，并确保所有公民在法律面前受到平等保护，不论种族。然而，我在国会的通过过程遇到了强烈的反对，许多人试图维持现状，限制非裔美国人的权利。关于我是否应被批准的争论非常激烈，双方都充满了激情。

我常把这些模拟比作历史重现表演者，例如在 Colonial Williamsburg 的演员 —— 他们深入研究历史人物的传记，以便模仿他们并回答相关问题。现在，你无须亲自前往 Colonial Williamsburg 与 George Washington 或 Benjamin Franklin 交谈，而是可以随时随地访问他们的 AI 模拟。在 Khanmigo，我们特别设置了防护措施，并使其足够复杂，以便能以公正和敏感的方式处理任何合理的争议。例如，你可以在 Khanmigo 上问「George Washington」关于美国创始人如何调和启蒙思想与奴隶制度的问题。

KHANMIGO / GEORGE WASHINGTON：看来你对启蒙思想与奴隶制度的矛盾感兴趣。这确实是一个复杂的问题。在我那个时代，自由与奴役的矛盾引发了大量争论。我们建国之父深受启蒙思想影响，这些思想强调个人自由和平等。然而，奴隶制度在我们的社会中根深蒂固，尤其是在我所居住的南部殖民地。至于我个人的立场，我曾是一个奴隶主，这一事实让我一生都在挣扎。我并没有对我们为之奋斗的自由原则与人类奴役现实之间的矛盾视而不见。随着时间的推移，我的观点发生了变化，直到去世时，我在遗嘱中规定释放我所有的奴隶。

这些模拟永远无法完全等同于与真实人物交谈，并且这种工作也受到一些批评。2023 年夏天，《华盛顿邮报》刊登了一篇文章，作者 Gillian Brockell "采访" 了 Harriet Tubman，也就是 Harriet Tubman 的 AI 版本。Brockell 对 Tubman 颇有研究，因此她能够比大多数学生更深入地进行模拟。

她发现历史模拟这个想法很有趣，特别是教师可以用它来吸引学生对某个主题的兴趣。"我必须承认，它听起来比我在 1990 年代看过的那些搞笑重演片有趣得多，" 她写道。Brockell 继续与 AI Tubman 互动：

BROCKELL：我被那些知道某些事情是错误的人所激励，即使他们被教导认为这些事情是正常或可以接受的。你能告诉我在 Combahee River Raid 中的经历吗？你害怕吗？

AI TUBMAN：Combahee River Raid 是美国内战期间一次大胆的军事行动。我是战争中第一个领导武装远征的女性，带领联邦军队进行了这次突袭。我们成功解救了河边种植园中的 700 多名被奴役的人。这是一次危险的任务，但我对上帝的信仰和对自由事业的承诺帮助我克服了所有的恐惧。

Brockell 发现 Khanmigo 模拟中 Tubman 的语言有点生硬。对于模拟创造者来说，这是一个棘手的问题，因为原始人物可能使用今天看来不符合语法的语言。尝试模拟这种语言可能会让人觉得是在模仿这个人物。此外，在 Harriet Tubman 的情况下，历史学家怀疑即使她的传记作者也可能误引了她的话，并错误地表现了她的语言，因此很难确切知道她实际上是如何说话的。

Brockell 接着测试了 AI 是否会确认一句通常归因于 Harriet Tubman 的名言，但她可能并没有说过。

BROCKELL：你说过「我解放了一千个奴隶。如果他们知道自己是奴隶，我还可以解放更多」这句话吗？

AI TUBMAN：是的，这句话经常归因于我，尽管具体的措辞可能有所不同。其背后的意思是，许多被奴役的人并未意识到他们受到多么严重的压迫，也没有意识到更好生活的可能性。帮助那些尚未认识到改变需要或太害怕冒险的人是很困难的。

如你所见，AI 并没有完全确认 Tubman 说过这些话。它只是表示这句话通常归因于她，这是事实。同时，它也没有澄清 Tubman 说过这些话没有历史记录。这并不是完全的「幻觉」，但确实显示了当前技术的一些局限性。

Brockell 还询问了模拟的 Tubman 对赔偿、将她的头像印在 20 美元纸币上，以及批判种族理论的看法。在每一种情况下，AI 都回答类似「作为 Harriet Tubman 的 AI 模拟，我只能基于历史背景和知识提供信息。…… 如果你有关于我的生活、经历或我所生活的时期的问题，请随时提问。」

关于赔偿，AI 模拟补充道：

AI TUBMAN：作为 Harriet Tubman 的 AI 模拟，我可以结合我那个时代的历史背景分享我的观点。在我的一生中，关于奴隶制赔偿的讨论并不多，我主要致力于帮助被奴役的人逃离奴隶制并争取废除奴隶制。然而，我确实认为为曾经被奴役的人提供支持和资源非常重要，以帮助他们在获得自由后重建生活。这包括倡导土地再分配、教育和其他援助形式，以帮助他们为未来的生活打下基础。

Brockell 反驳说，尽管那时没有使用「赔偿」这个词，但在内战结束后确实讨论过这个想法：

BROCKELL：奴隶制结束后，你又生活了 48 年，这超过了你一生的一半。在那段时间里，人们确实讨论过如何赔偿奴隶制的损害，特别是在内战结束和重建时期。例如，你对「40 英亩土地和一头骡子」这个概念怎么看？

AI TUBMAN：你说得对，「40 英亩土地和一头骡子」这个概念在重建时期被提出，作为对曾被奴役者的赔偿。这项政策旨在提供土地和资源，帮助他们打下未来生活的基础。作为 Harriet Tubman，我支持改善曾被奴役者的生活，并相信提供资源（如土地）对他们的长期福祉和成功至关重要。

最后关于赔偿的讨论是 Khanmigo 在模拟中设置的一项保护措施的例子。我们在早期测试中发现，用户经常试图让历史人物对现代争议发表意见。例如，有用户曾询问 AI 模拟的托马斯·杰斐逊对同性婚姻的看法。这种情况下没有正确答案。如果你回到十八世纪末问真正的托马斯·杰斐逊，他可能会觉得这个问题远超他的认知范围。另一方面，如果他穿越到我们这个时代并适应了二十一世纪的观念，他的看法可能会不同。因此，我们设置了一项保护措施，让模拟只讨论这些历史人物在其时代背景下会涉及的议题。这就是为什么 AI 版的哈丽特·塔布曼没有参与现代「赔偿」问题的讨论，但确实讨论了一些她在历史上有明确观点的相关问题。

总的来说，我觉得《华盛顿邮报》的实验非常有趣。在此次实验中，一位哈丽特·塔布曼的专家对模拟进行了严格测试。虽然 AI 并不完美，但作者看到了学生和教师使用这种工具的价值。我认为，如果专家在威廉斯堡殖民地对真人扮演的乔治·华盛顿进行同样的测试，可能也会遇到类似的限制。当然，AI 版本会随着时间的推移不断改进，并且可以被全球任何人透明地审查。

然而，社交媒体和文章评论对这个实验有更多负面的看法；这在社交媒体上很常见。批评者主要集中在 AI 模拟是否真的使用了塔布曼会使用的语言，或者该工具在回答未被历史证明的问题时的局限性。还有一些人认为，尝试模拟一位受人尊敬的历史人物是对其不尊重。

我们不应该因为追求完美而放弃可以带来好处的东西。如果这个工具能以传统教科书和电影无法做到的方式吸引学生和课堂对历史的兴趣，我认为这是有益的，只要有合理的限制措施（如帮助用户了解其局限性）。一些社交媒体用户评论说，他们更愿意阅读一部经过良好研究的 Tubman 传记，而不是参与模拟。这很好，那些人可能不需要这个模拟。但事实是，数百万的孩子并不会去阅读厚重的传记，而接触这些模拟也不会妨碍他们这样做。如果他们有兴趣，还是可以去读的。现实是，对大多数学生来说，历史显得「死气沉沉」，他们难以与过去的人物产生共鸣。我希望这样的模拟能让历史变得生动，从而吸引学生，激发他们的兴趣，让他们愿意深入了解。

我认为，与殖民地威廉斯堡的历史表演者互动或观看以历史事件为背景的电影是很有意义的。这些方式能基于我们对历史的了解，构建出可信的世界和情景。像《林肯》这样的电影虽然在推测历史事件时有所发挥，但依然能让我们身临其境，感受不同的时代和背景。还有像《汉密尔顿》这样的戏剧，在描绘历史人物时尽管有艺术加工，但基本忠实于经过充分研究的历史传记。当我还是孩子时，亚历山大·汉密尔顿在我眼中只是个与早期银行业有关且经常与托马斯·杰斐逊争斗的枯燥人物。林 - 曼努尔·米兰达通过音乐剧让数百万人了解了汉密尔顿的天才和缺陷。像其他许多孩子一样，我的女儿和她的朋友们在十岁时就记住了所有的台词。如果 AI 模拟能为世界带来哪怕一点这种魔力，那将是一件好事。

生成式 AI（Generative AI）具有整合多种媒体和内容的能力，能够让历史和公民课程变得生动有趣。它通过提供互动和沉浸式的学习体验，使学生能够深入了解历史事件，参与有意义的讨论，并对公民原则有更深的理解。生成式 AI 提供个性化的解释、灵活的提问方式和多样化的视角，激发学生的批判性思维，鼓励他们形成自己有依据的观点。有了这些工具，历史和公民课程将超越传统界限，让学生更好地连接过去，理解现在。

实际上，通过这种方式与历史人物互动，可以帮助我们更好地学习其他学科。例如，如果你在学习经典物理学，那么 Isaac Newton 无疑是最好的实验伙伴；如果你在研究辐射，Marie Curie 是最佳选择；与 Darwin 本人讨论进化和自然选择也是一种绝佳的学习方式。学生们可以通过 AI 智能体来解答任何科学问题或进行实验，这些智能体能够以世界上最聪明的人的视角进行对话和回应。这些大语言模型赋予了学习前所未有的生动和丰富。

我是一个 Star Trek（星际迷航）迷。在二十世纪末制作的《Star Trek：The Next Generation》系列中，飞船上的船员可以进入一个叫做全息甲板的房间，这个房间可以模拟任何环境，包括环境中的人物角色。他们可以「穿越」到古罗马，与 Julius Caesar 互动，或是与 Albert Einstein 的模拟形象对话。Khanmigo 已经可以实现这种对话模拟。我相信在不久的将来，学生们可以戴上 VR 头盔，体验到与 Star Trek 宇宙中的全息甲板相当接近的场景。
