### 9.1 Employment in an AI World

Many people fear that AI is going to lead to mass layoffs in favor of new, AI-powered tools that can do jobs faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than humans. Some companies have already paused hiring for roles that they think artificial intelligence will replace in the coming years. In 2023, IBM announced that it was suspending or slowing back-office hiring by 30 percent over a five-year period for jobs that could ultimately be done by AI. IBM's revelation suggests that the future of work is going to roll out differently, with back- or middle-office jobs disappearing, together with non-client-facing roles involving tasks such as creating budgets, managing data, and organizing records. Reading the tea leaves, we can see where this might be going.

What will jobs in an AI-infused marketplace look like and how do we prepare our learners for them? Since ChatGPT came on the scene, many in the know have been saying that you won't get replaced by AI, but you might get replaced by someone else using AI.

Writers and copywriters using AI could potentially be three to five times as productive. The same will go for software engineers who are using AI copilots to debug and fill in large portions of their code. Graphic designers will be able to make fifty variations of a logo by tweaking a series of text-based prompts. Given this increase in productivity, are we going to need as many copywriters, engineers, and graphic designers?

I suspect it will be a mixed bag. Because we are at such a technological inflection point that allows us to do so much more with generative AI, the demand for engineers, especially ones who are five to ten times more productive, is only going to go up. We've seen this happen in the past. In the early 2000s, accelerating globalization allowed a lot of software engineering work to be outsourced to places such as India. As a young engineer at the time, I thought I had to go to business school and change to a career in finance to avoid being disrupted by low-cost labor from abroad.

I was wrong. Since then, software engineering salaries have gone up much faster than the rate of inflation. This is because smartphones and the rise of the internet created an environment conducive to new software-based solutions. Generative AI is creating an even riper environment for further innovation. From my vantage point, because of generative AI, there is endless work for engineers who can creatively apply these technologies to solve new problems in nearly every industry.

On the other hand, I'm not as bullish for, say, the people currently writing news summaries about daily stock market fluctuations. If it isn't already happening, these types of tasks will soon be done by generative AI. The copywriters and technical writers who are going to survive are going to be the ones who lean in most on AI to increase their productivity. The other 90 percent are going to have to find something else to do.

The good news is, generative AI will require new kinds of work. One of the hottest jobs today is being a prompt writer or prompt engineer. Two years ago, no one knew what those jobs were. It turns out that an open-minded and creative copywriter could transition quite well into some of these roles. Generative AI is also making us envision entirely new opportunities around safety, security, and antibias. I suspect that as more organizations wrestle with how to apply this technology, new opportunities will continue to emerge.

In the same way that teachers are using AI to facilitate their more rote or mundane responsibilities, positions from HR to management will begin to task AI with producing hiring letters or meeting reports. On the surface, this sounds good and helpful, yet I also can't help but consider the larger consequences.

It isn't just about individual jobs. AI-induced natural selection is also going to be happening at the corporate level. If we have two companies—one that's smaller, leaner, and more automated, and another that's bigger, slower, and more dependent on human labor—over time, the smaller company will be able to offer an equivalent or better product for a lower price and start to gain more market share from the bigger company, which ultimately leads to a net loss of jobs. This is a common trend that we see in many industries, and this will continue as automation and technology advance at a rapid pace. On the one hand, the smaller company can provide goods or services more efficiently and at a lower cost, which can be beneficial for consumers. On the other hand, the job losses can be difficult for those who are directly affected.

This is already starting to unfold in dramatic fashion. In 2006, the education technology company Chegg, Inc. launched as a service that assisted nearly three million customers with homework, digital and physical textbook rentals, and online tutoring. Just two and a half years before ChatGPT, Forbes called the company the most valuable ed-tech business in America. Once ChatGPT arrived, Chegg pivoted and began to incorporate AI into its platform, but it was no match for ChatGPT. When Chegg announced its quarterly earnings in May 2023, the CEO admitted that the service had been struggling to keep up with OpenAI's offering, because so many students were using the large language model for help with their homework. The company admitted it no longer had any idea how much money it was going to make that year because of the influence of ChatGPT. This bombshell admission led to Chegg's stock plummeting almost 50 percent. Since the arrival of generative AI, many have worried that these tools will upend established businesses. As distant as this fear once was, it remained speculative until it suddenly became a bit too real, with stories like this.

These sentiments are not mine alone.

"It's going to affect every industry differently, every person differently, and every job differently," Wharton's Ethan Mollick says. "The job that's least affected by AI, according to the early-stage research we have, is roofing, and yet I've talked to a couple roofers who're like, ‘Actually, roofing is going to change, too, because we can now do all of our proposals with AI help.' "

When you develop artificial intelligence that can understand language, recognize patterns, and solve problems, as well as AI that can diagnose illnesses, make stock market trades, compose music, fight lawsuits, understand emotions, analyze genetic code, handle insurance claims, engineer, and write articles, it is not hard to believe that more changes are coming. The successful strategy will not be to resist but to adapt.

在一个 AI 世界中的就业

很多人担心 AI 会带来大规模裁员，因为新的 AI 工具能够比人类更快、更便宜、更高效地完成工作。一些公司已经暂停了那些认为未来几年会被 AI 取代的职位的招聘。2023 年，IBM 宣布将在五年内暂停或放缓 30% 后台职位的招聘，这些职位最终可能会由 AI 完成。IBM 的这一决定表明，工作的未来将会有所不同，后台或中层职位将会消失，以及不直接面对客户的角色，例如创建预算、管理数据和组织记录。通过观察这些趋势，我们可以看到未来的方向。

在一个充满 AI 的市场中，工作将是什么样子？我们又该如何为学习者做好准备呢？自从 ChatGPT 出现以来，很多人都在说，你不会被 AI 取代，但可能会被使用 AI 的人取代。

使用 AI 的作家和文案可能会提高三到五倍的生产力。同样，使用 AI 副驾驶来调试和编写大量代码的软件工程师也是如此。图形设计师可以通过调整一系列文本提示来制作五十种不同的标志变体。鉴于生产力的提升，我们是否还需要那么多的文案、工程师和图形设计师呢？

我认为这个问题有好有坏。因为我们正处在技术发展的拐点，生成式 AI（Generative AI）能让我们做更多事情，对工程师的需求，尤其是那些效率高出五到十倍的工程师的需求，只会增加。我们在过去也见过这种情况。在 2000 年代初期，全球化加速，许多软件工程工作被外包到印度等地。当时作为一名年轻工程师，我以为自己必须去商学院，转行到金融业，才能避免被低成本的国外劳动力淘汰。

我错了。从那时起，软件工程师的薪资上涨速度远超通货膨胀率。这是因为智能手机和互联网的兴起，为新的软件解决方案创造了有利环境。现在生成式 AI 进一步促进了创新，创造了更好的环境。从我的角度看，生成式 AI 带来了无尽的机会，工程师可以创造性地应用这些技术来解决各行各业的新问题。

另一方面，我对那些目前撰写每日股市波动新闻摘要的人不太乐观。如果这还没发生，这类工作很快就会被生成式 AI 替代。能够生存下来的文案撰稿人和技术撰稿人，将是那些最依赖 AI 提高生产力的人。其他 90% 的人将不得不另寻出路。

好消息是，生成式 AI（Generative AI）带来了新的工作机会。今天最热门的工作之一是提示编写者或提示工程师。两年前，没有人知道这些工作是什么。事实证明，思想开放且富有创意的文案撰稿人可以很好地转型到这些角色中。生成式 AI 还使我们能够设想围绕安全性、保障和反偏见的全新机会。我怀疑，随着更多组织努力应用这项技术，新的机会将继续涌现。

就像教师们使用 AI 来简化他们更多机械或平凡的职责一样，从人力资源到管理层的各个职位将开始让 AI 生成聘用信或会议报告。表面上看，这似乎很好且有帮助，但我也不禁考虑到背后的更大后果。

这不仅仅关系到个人工作。AI 引发的自然选择也会在公司层面发生。如果我们有两家公司，一个较小、更精简且更自动化的公司和另一个较大、更慢且更依赖人力的公司，随着时间的推移，较小的公司能够以更低的价格提供同等或更好的产品，并开始从较大的公司中获得更多市场份额，这最终会导致净工作岗位的减少。这是我们在许多行业中看到的常见趋势，随着自动化和技术的快速发展，这种趋势将继续下去。一方面，较小的公司可以更高效地提供商品或服务，并且成本更低，这对消费者有利。另一方面，失业对那些直接受影响的人来说是困难的。

这一变化已经开始以惊人的方式展开。2006 年，教育科技公司 Chegg, Inc. 成立，帮助近三百万用户完成作业，提供数字和实体教科书租赁，以及在线辅导服务。就在 ChatGPT 出现的两年半前，Forbes 将 Chegg 称为美国最有价值的教育科技公司。然而，随着 ChatGPT 的到来，Chegg 试图将 AI 融入其平台，但仍然无法与 ChatGPT 竞争。2023 年 5 月，Chegg 发布季度财报时，CEO 承认，由于太多学生使用 OpenAI 的大语言模型来完成作业，公司一直在努力跟上这一趋势。Chegg 还承认，由于 ChatGPT 的影响，他们无法预测今年的收入。这一消息导致 Chegg 的股票暴跌近 50%。自生成式 AI（Generative AI）出现以来，很多人担心这些工具会颠覆现有企业。曾经，这种担忧只是推测，但随着这样的故事发生，这种担忧变得非常现实。

这些担忧不仅仅是我个人的。

「它将以不同的方式影响每个行业、每个人和每个工作，」Wharton 的 Ethan Mollick 说。「根据我们早期的研究，受 AI 影响最小的工作是屋顶工，但我与几位屋顶工交谈时，他们说，‘实际上，屋顶工作也会改变，因为我们现在可以用 AI 帮助完成所有的提案。'」

当你开发出能够理解语言、识别模式、解决问题的人工智能（AI）时，比如那些能诊断疾病、进行股票交易、作曲、打官司、理解情感、分析基因密码、处理保险理赔、进行工程设计和写文章的 AI，你会发现更多的变化就在眼前。与其抗拒变化，不如学会适应。

### 9.2 How to Prepare Kids to Thrive in the AI-Future Workplace

It is several months before we launch Khanmigo, and I am speaking at the Stanford Computer Science Department along with a professor named Chris Piech. He tells me a story about a young Stanford student he was advising who came into his office. "She was really upset, saying how she just learned how to code and now artificial intelligence was able to do it better," Piech says. "She felt like she was already marginalized."

For the past twenty years, software engineering and data science have been the hottest two jobs for young people right out of college. We encourage them to go into these professions if they want to be part of the future. We advocate for students to learn how to code to become part of the digital economy. But what we now know is that generative AI can do this well.

This creates tension. We are afraid to allow kids to use AI tools in school in order to prevent cheating, despite the fact that they will have future jobs requiring close symbiosis with these same tools. This is compounded by what Bill Gates calls another "confounding paradox." We now have a tool that makes it easier for those who want to learn, but sadly, in some cases, it makes people wonder if they need those skills at all. Why should students learn skills that AI can do better?

"So what did you tell her?" I ask Piech.

"I said I believe the ability to code is going to be really important. I told her if she wants to create any type of major solution, including a solution that uses generative AI, even if the generative AI can write pieces of code, you really need to know how those pieces can fit together."

In other words, he says, it will be important to learn to work in concert with generative AI. In order to build anything, you are still going to need to know how the pieces fit together and how they actually work.

Entry-level employees who understand AI, and use it, will be far more efficient than those who don't. My fourteen-year-old son loves to code and aspires to someday make video games. I think he has a great shot at this, but I also encourage him to use generative AI to tackle more ambitious projects than he would ordinarily be able to do on his own. He is going to be able to make games that, before generative AI, would have required a team of half a dozen professional engineers to create.

It is well documented that generative AI can write with real competency. This does not mean that one should not learn how to write. If one of my children came to me and said they wanted to be a screenwriter, I would tell them to get really good at writing screenplays. Then I would encourage them to use generative AI to take on more and more enterprising projects. You need to be good at a craft in order to know what high quality looks like. Even more, an individual with a strong sense of story and film will no longer have to stop at the screenwriting phase. A screenwriter could actually produce the movie with the help of generative AI. This technology can already produce music and videos. It can even edit raw footage. A film that used to cost a hundred million dollars and take several years to make will likely soon be doable by a handful of film students with a fraction of that budget. We do not know how much better these systems are going to get, but even the current generation of AI is starting to cause a disruption along these lines in the film industry, as well as in many others.

Early controlled studies on productivity improvement due to AI by the Wharton School are seeing 30 to 80 percent performance improvement on many high-powered white-collar analytical tasks. This includes stronger and more concise writing, analysis, consulting, and programming.

"If you want to be in these fields, AI is, and will remain, a part of your life," Mollick says. "You need to figure out if you can use AI to be ten times more productive—meaning there remains a need for humans to be in the loop. If you are trying to be a copy editor, a coder, or even a roofer, you will need to be a centaur, only instead of being half human and half horse, you must be half human and half large language model."

To meet the demands of this new world of work, educators are going to have to, explicitly or implicitly, continue making their students familiar with these tools and the power that they have. Generative AI is what's called a general-purpose technology, one that comes along very rarely. Think of the transformations brought about by steam power, computers, or the internet. Generative AI is likely to transform our lives faster, and more profoundly, than any of these previous inflection points.

The Industrial Revolution was all about specialization of labor. We created assembly lines and workers then specialized in certain jobs on that assembly line. That trend has continued ever since, as complex organizations have developed complex systems. The benefits of specialization are going to continue in an AI world.

"Exactly what the job market of tomorrow looks like is very hard to predict, but the deeper the skill set, whether it's medical consultation, scientific thinking, or customer support, the more value it's going to have, even in a world where productivity will be enhanced by AI," Bill Gates tells me. Not only is there more reason than ever for kids to continue to learn about their fields of interest, he says, but students need to accelerate learning these skills, and to learn them as well as possible. "Entry-level jobs are going to require people to understand how to use large language models and all of the tools they offer. You'll need them to create everything from invoices to business plans. The workplace is going to encourage its workforce to come up with the best product it can. The higher your skill level is, the more your skill will retain a substantial value in the workforce. It's the workforce plus the AI, working together."

Yet, in the world we are entering, it is not just about specialization. Those who succeed might be deep in one or two areas, but they also need entrepreneurial expertise in a broad set of domains in order to put all of the pieces together.

This is nothing new. When I started Khan Academy, I knew how to code, so I was able to start prototyping it without needing any money or help. I was also good at putting together tools that already existed and seeing utility in them that others did not. I used YouTube for videos and instant messaging to communicate with the cousins I was tutoring. I was a hedge fund analyst, so even though I had never run a nonprofit before, I knew enough about finance and accounting to get it off the ground. People who are able to embark on a project this way will always have an advantage as entrepreneurs, but there is a limit to how far they can go on their own. At some point, they need to raise money and hire people. Just as software and the internet facilitated remarkable growth (I was able to scale Khan Academy to one hundred thousand users as a side hobby on my own), generative AI will allow the next generation of entrepreneurs to go even further.

We are entering a world where we are going back to a pre–Industrial Revolution, craftsmanlike experience. A small group of people who understand engineering, sales, marketing, finance, and design are going to be able to manage armies of generative AI and put all of these pieces together.

When economists talk about the factors of production, they talk about things like capital, labor, land, and other resources such as energy. But they also talk about entrepreneurship. From an economics point of view, entrepreneurship is really the creativity of knowing how to put resources together in order to create value. So how do we prepare every student to be this type of entrepreneur?

Step one is to get out of the way. I believe all human beings are born highly creative and entrepreneurial. Unfortunately, our Industrial Revolution–designed education system unintentionally suppresses both traits. Kids learn to sit in rows, make no noise, and take notes. They are spoon-fed knowledge and forced to learn in lockstep. Both academically and socially, nonconformity is punished. When students are young adults and most capable of being creative entrepreneurs, the system instead bogs them down with hours of busywork that squeezes out any time for their passions.

Step two is a little bit more traditional. As Bill Gates mentioned, the successful workers of the future will be those with deep and broad skills. The "three Rs" of reading, writing, and arithmetic are more important than ever. On top of that, a solid appreciation and understanding of history, art, science, law, and finance would round out someone well. Luckily, we now have the technological tools to ensure the mastery of these skills without having to enforce the lockstep learning of the industrial age.

Finally, it's more important than ever that students have strong communication, collaboration, and empathy skills. Traditional entrepreneurship tends to invoke ideas of starting a business, but what I am describing goes much further and includes a more personal vision. It is an ability to look at the various parts of your job, and to see any problem that needs solving, to know where you must focus your research and to understand the pieces that you need to put in place in order to solve it. To thrive in an AI world, everyone needs to be this type of entrepreneur, even if they are working for someone else. Schools can make this happen by putting students in the driver's seat more often, using AI tools to better support student mastery of core skills and free up time for student agency and creativity.

如何让孩子在 AI 时代的职场中脱颖而出

在我们推出 Khanmigo 几个月前，我在斯坦福大学计算机科学系和教授 Chris Piech 一起演讲。他告诉我一个故事：他指导的一位年轻斯坦福学生走进他的办公室，非常沮丧。「她刚学会编程，现在 AI 已经能做得更好，」Piech 说。「她觉得自己已经被边缘化了。」

在过去二十年里，软件工程和数据科学一直是大学毕业生最热门的两个职业。我们鼓励年轻人进入这些领域，认为这是未来的趋势。我们也主张学生学习编程，以便融入数字经济。但现在我们知道，生成式 AI（Generative AI）已经能很好地完成这些工作。

这让人感到矛盾。为了防止作弊，我们不敢让孩子们在学校使用 AI 工具，尽管他们未来的工作需要与这些工具密切合作。比尔·盖茨称之为另一个「令人困惑的悖论」。我们现在有了一种工具，可以让那些想学习的人更容易掌握知识，但遗憾的是，在某些情况下，它让人们怀疑是否需要学习这些技能。为什么学生还要学习 AI 能做得更好的技能？

「那你对她说了什么？」我问 Piech。

「我说我相信编程能力将会变得非常关键。我告诉她，如果她想要创建任何重要的解决方案，包括使用生成式 AI（Generative AI）的解决方案，即使生成式 AI 可以编写代码片段，你仍然需要知道这些片段如何组合起来。」

换句话说，他说，学习如何与生成式 AI 协同工作将变得非常重要。要构建任何东西，你仍然需要知道这些片段如何组合，以及它们实际上是如何工作的。

懂得并使用 AI 的初级员工将比那些不懂的员工效率高得多。我十四岁的儿子喜欢编程，并且有志于将来制作视频游戏。我认为他有很大的机会实现这一目标，但我也鼓励他使用生成式 AI 来完成比他通常能够单独完成的更有野心的项目。他将能够制作在生成式 AI 出现之前需要半打专业工程师才能创建的游戏。

生成式 AI 在写作方面表现出色，这已被广泛记录。但这并不意味着人们不需要学习写作。如果我的一个孩子来找我，说他想成为编剧，我会告诉他要非常擅长编写剧本。然后我会鼓励他使用生成式 AI 承担更多创新项目。你需要擅长一门手艺，才能识别高质量的作品。更重要的是，一个具有强烈故事感和电影感的人，不再需要停留在编剧阶段。他们实际上可以在生成式 AI 的帮助下制作电影。这项技术已经能够制作音乐和视频，甚至可以编辑原始镜头。以前需要花费一亿美元并花费数年时间制作的电影，很可能很快就能由少数电影学生以一小部分预算完成。我们不知道这些系统未来会变得多么强大，但即使是当前一代的 AI，也已经开始在电影行业以及其他许多领域引起变革。

沃顿商学院的早期控制研究显示，AI 能够显著提高生产力，在许多高端白领分析任务上，表现提升了 30% 到 80%。这包括更强且更简洁的写作、分析、咨询和编程。

「如果你想进入这些领域，AI 已经并将继续成为你生活的一部分，」Mollick 说。「你需要弄清楚如何使用 AI 将生产力提高十倍 —— 这意味着人类仍然需要参与其中。如果你想成为一名编辑、一名程序员，甚至是一名屋顶工人，你就需要像半人马一样，只不过是半人半大语言模型。」

为了适应新的工作世界，教育者需要主动或被动地让学生了解这些工具及其强大之处。生成式 AI（Generative AI）是一种非常罕见的通用技术。想想蒸汽动力、计算机或互联网带来的巨大变革，生成式 AI 可能会比这些转折点更快、更深刻地改变我们的生活。

工业革命强调的是劳动的专业化。我们发明了装配线，工人们在装配线上专注于某些特定的工作。随着复杂组织的发展，这种趋势一直持续到今天。专业化的优势将在 AI 时代继续存在。

比尔·盖茨说：「未来的就业市场具体会是什么样子很难预测，但无论是医疗咨询、科学思维还是客户支持，技能越深，在 AI 提升生产力的世界里价值就越大。」他认为，孩子们不仅需要继续学习感兴趣的领域，而且要加快学习这些技能，并尽可能精通。「入门级工作将要求人们掌握如何使用大语言模型（LLM）及其各种工具。你需要用它们来创建从发票到商业计划等各种文档。工作场所将鼓励员工尽力创造出最好的产品。你的技能越高，在劳动力市场上的价值就越大。这是劳动力与 AI 的共同协作。」

然而，在我们即将进入的这个世界里，不仅仅是强调专业化。那些能够成功的人，可能会在一两个领域深入发展，但他们还需要在广泛的领域中具备创业能力，以便将所有资源整合在一起。

这并不是什么新鲜事。当我创办可汗学院时，因为我会编程，所以能够在没有资金或帮助的情况下开始制作原型。我也擅长将现有的工具结合起来，发现其独特的实用性。我利用 YouTube 制作视频，通过即时通讯与我辅导的堂兄弟们沟通。我曾是一名对冲基金分析师，所以即使我从未经营过非营利组织，但对财务和会计有一定了解，能够让它启动。以这种方式开展项目的人在创业时总是有优势，但他们单打独斗的能力是有限的。某个时刻，他们需要筹集资金和雇佣人员。正如软件和互联网促进了显著增长（我能够将可汗学院作为副业扩展到十万用户），生成式 AI（Generative AI）将使下一代企业家走得更远。

我们正在进入一个类似于工业革命前的工匠时代。一小群精通工程、销售、市场营销、财务和设计的人，将能够管理大量的生成式 AI，并将所有这些部分整合在一起。

当经济学家谈论生产要素时，他们提到资本、劳动力、土地和其他资源（如能源）。但他们也谈到创业。从经济学的角度来看，创业实际上是指如何将资源整合起来创造价值的创造力。那么我们如何让每个学生都具备这种企业家精神呢？

第一步是要改变现状。我相信每个人天生都具有高度的创造力和创业精神。然而，工业革命设计的教育系统无意间压制了这两种特质。孩子们习惯于排队坐，保持安静，做笔记。他们被填鸭式教育，必须步调一致地学习。在学术和社交方面，不随大流的行为往往会受到惩罚。当学生进入青年成年期，正是他们最具创造力和创业潜力的时候，系统却用大量的繁重作业压榨了他们追求激情的时间。

第二步比较传统。正如比尔·盖茨所说，未来成功的工作者将是那些拥有深厚和广泛技能的人。阅读、写作和算术这三种基本技能比以往任何时候都更为重要。此外，对历史、艺术、科学、法律和金融的深刻理解和欣赏也会使一个人更加全面。幸运的是，我们现在有了技术工具，可以确保学生掌握这些技能，而不必像工业时代那样强制统一学习。

最后，比以往任何时候都更重要的是，学生需要具备强大的沟通、合作和同理心技能。传统意义上的创业通常让人想到开办企业，但我所描述的创业远不止如此，还包含了更个人化的愿景。这是一种能够全面审视工作各个部分的能力，识别需要解决的问题，知道研究的重点，并了解需要采取的步骤来解决问题。要在 AI 时代茁壮成长，每个人都需要具备这种创业精神，即使他们在为他人工作。学校可以通过让学生更多地掌控自己的学习过程，使用 AI 工具更好地支持学生掌握核心技能，并腾出时间让学生发挥自主性和创造力来实现这一目标。

### 9.3 Matchmaking Between Job Seekers and Employers

In 1999, for a cover story on the new millennium, Computerworld magazine asked me for predictions that might come to pass in the coming ten to twenty years. I was surprised that they were asking me, a recent college graduate who was a new product manager at Oracle, given that the other nineteen people they interviewed were titans of technology like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison. The editor in chief had attended my college graduation, where I spoke as class president; he thought it would be interesting to get a more youthful perspective in the mix.

Regardless, I didn't want to waste the opportunity and ran with the most far-out ideas that I thought might be plausible. I talked about a future in which we would all have artificially intelligent personal agents to represent us in "cyberspace." The agents would purchase things for you and broker transactions, even matchmake between employers and employees (or romantic partners). Twenty-three years went by and, for the most part, my predictions didn't come to pass. AI hadn't advanced to the necessary degree.

Fast-forward to now, and this latest generation of generative AI holds the very real promise of making my predictions seem conservative. As optimistic as I was about progress in AI in 1999, what we have started to see in the early 2020s far surpasses anything that I could have imagined happening in my lifetime. Among many other things, AI, as our personal agent, will soon post, find, apply for, and even acquire jobs for us.

Traditionally, for every job opening at our company, we write job descriptions. Today, a hiring manager must first take the time to write that job description or work alongside someone in HR to create it. Once we post a job, we typically get several hundred résumés for every opening. Then we have our talent acquisition team go through those résumés, which is incredibly tedious work. Because these screeners can realistically spend only a few seconds on each résumé, their eyes likely focus on things like name brands of previous employers, keywords in previous job titles, or degrees from well-known universities. I can imagine that sometimes they are in the mood to dig a bit deeper, but sometimes they aren't. And this is before we come to any personal biases they bring to the table. This process is likely to miss a lot of great applicants, especially those who didn't spend time at well-known companies or schools.

Regardless, our recruiters flag a small pool of candidates for phone screens and possibly more interviews. If they pass the thirty-minute phone screen based on the recruiter's subjective judgment, the candidate will then be interviewed by four to six team members in the function that they are applying for. Due to scheduling complexity, this takes days or weeks. It's also quite expensive: six one-hour interviews from team members who make the equivalent of one hundred dollars an hour costs us six hundred dollars, before even considering the time to prep and debrief. To avoid inconsistency, we give interviewers a framework of questions. Yet, at the end of the day, the preferences and the mood of the interviewer likely dictate where the conversation goes. Eventually, we hope to get a signal that we have found a top choice and cross our fingers that we are making a good hire. It is a similar process almost everywhere.

This is an imperfect process on both sides. We probably overlooked some great candidates, and it took a lot of time and energy to eventually make an offer, knowing that it may not even be a perfect match. On top of that, by its very nature the process was not completely consistent. I also wouldn't be surprised if people's personal biases tilted things for or against certain applicants based on things that were not relevant to the job.

If all parties had infinite time and energy, the recruiters and the hiring managers would engage in in-depth conversations with every person interested in that job. They would apply the same standard consistently and be in the same mood and have the same level of enthusiasm for every candidate. Even better, we would be able to audit this process for bias by running test candidates through it. On top of that, in an ideal world it would take hours—not days or weeks—to come to a decision.

This might seem unrealistic, but it may now very well be possible to approach this ideal.

Large language models can already streamline the standard process in fairly obvious ways. Recruiters can use them to help draft job posts and interview questions. Candidates can use them to create cover letters and résumés. This, however, is just the tip of the iceberg.

In the future, if you are looking for a job, an application leveraging a large language model will create an interactive résumé that communicates with the AI that has posted the job you are applying for. Instead of just submitting a résumé and a cover letter into a void, every job candidate might be able to automatically have a rich conversation with the AI recruiter, an experience that potentially gives each person a much fairer shot.

You will not even have to wait for the employer's bot to schedule time with you. Rather, the employer's recruiter bot can talk to your agent bot. This agent will have learned to represent you accurately based on your employment history and extensive interviews that it has conducted with you.

Because it has been with you since you were a student, and because you've given it permission to access your entire work and education history, your skill sets, your interests, and even work samples you have produced, it will ask you what you are looking for in a job and the types of roles you might like to explore. It can even help coach you to think through career and education possibilities that match your life goals. Consider it as a supercharged life coach that learns to represent you to potential employers.

From there, it will look for the right positions on your behalf by talking to other AI bots that have posted these jobs. As a job seeker, your AI job agent could read literally every job posting that is out there. If you are looking to switch careers but do not have the right experience that 99 percent of employers want, your AI job agent could find the 1 percent willing to give you a shot. Your AI job agent might then report back that it just talked to a thousand employers and found a number that really value the fact that you are an outsider. Imagine a generative artificial intelligence that can solicit people over LinkedIn and reply to you with opportunities.

These bots, in theory, can have infinite conversations with each other and eventually glean a signal about a best fit for both parties. At the end of the day, if I am the hiring manager, my AI recruiting assistant will offer me the top five to ten people it thinks I should talk to based on the simulated conversations it has had with all the candidates' AI agents.

This isn't limited to just screening candidates. The AI recruiting assistant will be capable of engaging with the references that the candidate has provided. Based on this, it can further refine its recommendations.

Even during the live interview with the candidate, the AI recruiting assistant could whisper into your ear good follow-up questions or provide real-time feedback to ensure that you're interviewing as fairly and consistently as possible.

The job application and hiring process will become far more equitable, faster, and less resource-intensive for everyone. Each person, or at least their AI agent, gets an interview with the hiring AI. Every company gets a chance to get to know you through your AI agent. They will go through your entire job history. I can imagine a world in which the traditional résumé may no longer be relevant or useful because your AI agent will do a much better job of representing you.

It's worth acknowledging that this might make some people uneasy. In fact, one of the biggest fears around AI is the bias it might introduce while screening résumés or interviewing candidates. I'll be the first to admit that it will be near impossible to create a system that is free of bias. Yet I'd argue that AI will be an improvement when it can be demonstrably less biased and more consistent than the status quo, which is subjective and full of bias. Yes, we should heavily scrutinize any AI systems that claim they can assist in the recruiting process, but I also think that eventually you will have the tools that have not only made the process more inclusive and efficient but have also made it far less biased.

求职者与雇主之间的匹配

1999 年，Computerworld 杂志为了报道新千禧年的封面故事，邀请我预测未来十到二十年可能发生的事情。我很惊讶他们会邀请我，一个刚从大学毕业并且是 Oracle 新产品经理的人，因为他们采访的其他十九个人都是科技界的巨擘，比如 Bill Gates 和 Larry Ellison。总编辑曾参加过我的大学毕业典礼，当时我作为班级主席发表演讲；他认为在报道中加入一个更年轻的视角会很有趣。

无论如何，我不想浪费这个机会，于是提出了我认为可能实现的一些离奇想法。我描述了一个未来，我们每个人都会在「网络空间」中拥有人工智能的个人代理。这些代理会为你购买东西和撮合交易，甚至在雇主和员工（或浪漫伴侣）之间进行匹配。二十三年过去了，大部分我的预测没有实现。人工智能还没有达到必要的程度。

时至今日，这最新一代的生成式 AI（Generative AI）使我的预测显得很保守。尽管我在 1999 年对 AI 的进展持乐观态度，但在 2020 年代初期我们开始看到的东西远远超出了我一生中能想象到的。AI 作为我们的个人代理，不久将为我们发布、寻找、申请，甚至获取工作。

传统上，对于公司每一个职位空缺，我们都要撰写职位描述。现在，招聘经理需要花时间写职位描述，或者与人力资源部门的同事一起完成。一旦职位发布出去，我们通常会收到几百份简历。接下来，我们的人才招聘团队要筛选这些简历，这是一件非常繁琐的工作。由于筛选人员只能在每份简历上花几秒钟，他们的注意力往往集中在以前雇主的知名度、职位名称中的关键词或是学历背景上。我想象有时候他们可能会深入挖掘，但有时候则不会。而且，这还不包括他们可能带来的个人偏见。这个过程可能会错过很多优秀的申请者，尤其是那些没有在知名公司或学校背景的候选人。

尽管如此，我们的招聘人员会挑选出一小部分候选人进行电话筛选，甚至更多的面试。如果候选人通过了基于招聘人员主观判断的三十分钟电话筛选，他们将由应聘职位部门的四到六名成员进行面试。由于安排复杂，这个过程可能需要几天甚至几周的时间。而且成本不菲：六名成员每人进行一小时的面试，按每小时一百美元计算，费用就达六百美元，还不包括准备和反馈的时间。为了避免面试过程中的不一致性，我们给面试官提供了一个问题框架。然而，最终面试官的个人偏好和情绪可能会影响面试的方向。最后，我们希望能找到一个合适的人选，并祈祷我们做出了正确的招聘决定。这几乎是各地普遍的过程。

这个招聘过程存在不完美之处。我们可能错过了一些优秀的候选人，并且在花费大量时间和精力后，最终的录用决定可能并不理想。而且，这个过程本身也不完全一致。我也不会惊讶地发现，由于个人偏见，一些与工作无关的因素影响了对某些申请者的评价。

如果所有参与者都有无限的时间和精力，招聘人员和经理们会与每一个对职位感兴趣的人进行深入交流。他们会始终如一地应用相同的标准，对每个候选人保持相同的态度和热情。更理想的是，我们可以通过测试候选人来审查过程中的偏见。并且在理想情况下，做出决定只需几个小时，而不是几天或几周。

虽然这看起来不太现实，但现在我们有可能接近这个理想状态。

大语言模型已经能够显著简化标准的招聘流程。招聘人员可以用它们来撰写职位发布和面试问题。候选人可以用它们来写求职信和简历。然而，这只是冰山一角。

未来，如果你在找工作，一个利用大语言模型的应用程序将会创建一个可以与发布你所申请职位的 AI 互动的简历。每个求职者不仅仅是提交简历和求职信，而是可以自动与 AI 招聘人员进行详尽的对话，从而为每个人提供更公平的机会。

你甚至不需要等待雇主的机器人来安排时间与你会面。相反，雇主的招聘机器人可以直接与您的智能体机器人交流。这个智能体会根据您的工作历史和与您的多次面试来准确地代表您。

由于它从您还是学生时就一直陪伴着您，并且您已经授权它访问您的整个工作和教育历史、技能集、兴趣，甚至您制作的工作样本，它会询问您想要寻找的工作类型和您感兴趣的职位。它还可以帮助您思考符合您人生目标的职业和教育选择。可以把它看作一个超级版的生活教练，能够代表您向潜在雇主展示。

接下来，它会通过与发布这些职位的其他 AI 机器人交流，来为您寻找合适的职位。作为求职者，您的 AI 求职智能体可以阅读所有发布的职位信息。如果您想换职业但没有 99% 的雇主要求的经验，您的 AI 求职智能体可以找到那 1% 愿意给您机会的雇主。您的 AI 求职智能体可能会反馈说，它刚刚与一千个雇主交谈，找到了几家真正重视您外部视角的公司。想象一下，一个生成式 AI（Generative AI）可以通过 LinkedIn 招揽人才并向您回复机会。

理论上，这些机器人可以无限次地相互对话，最终找到对双方最合适的匹配。最终，如果我是招聘经理，我的 AI 招聘助手会根据它与所有候选人智能体进行的模拟对话，向我推荐它认为我应该交谈的前五到十人。

这不仅仅限于筛选候选人。AI 招聘助手还能与候选人提供的推荐人进行互动，并基于这些信息进一步优化推荐。

在与候选人进行现场面试时，AI 招聘助手还可以在你耳边提示适合的跟进问题或提供实时反馈，确保面试的公平和一致性。

求职和招聘过程将变得更加公平、快速，并且资源消耗更少。每个人，或者至少他们的 AI 智能体，都能和招聘 AI 进行一次面试。每家公司也都有机会通过 AI 智能体全面了解你。我可以想象一个传统简历不再重要的世界，因为 AI 智能体会更好地展示你的能力。

当然，这可能让一些人感到不安。实际上，人们对 AI 的一个最大担忧就是它在筛选简历或面试候选人时可能引入偏见。我承认，创建一个完全没有偏见的系统几乎是不可能的。然而，当 AI 明显比现有方法更少偏见、更一致时，它就是一种进步。是的，我们应该严格审查任何声称可以帮助招聘的 AI 系统，但我相信最终我们会拥有不仅使招聘过程更包容和高效，还能大幅减少偏见的工具。

### 9.4 Where This Leaves Us and Where It Will Take Us: A Call for Educated Bravery

Ihave a confession. I once thought I would be an AI researcher. I viewed, and still view, intelligence and perception—which are two different things—as the biggest mysteries of the universe. I was fascinated by the idea of being able to build something as smart, or even smarter, than any of us. I had read nearly every science-fiction book on the topic. I loved thinking about how we could prove whether another being was truly sentient. After all, we can only directly perceive our own perception. It is really a leap of faith that other creatures—including other people in our life—are truly sentient versus just acting like they are. The best way to understand intelligence, I once thought, was to construct machines that are capable of it.

When I was a freshman at MIT in 1994, I was lucky to have direct access to several of the titans of AI at the time. I sought out Patrick Henry Winston to be my freshman adviser. He was the director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and author of the canonical textbook on artificial intelligence at the time. I took his class, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. I also took Marvin Minsky's class, Society of Mind. Minsky was Winston's mentor and the founder of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He also won computer science's highest award—the Turing Award—for "his central role in creating, shaping, promoting, and advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence." His ideas were considered foundational for the field of artificial neural networks. He was also the AI adviser to Stanley Kubrick when he made perhaps the most famous AI film of all time, 2001: A Space Odyssey .

These professors were incredibly intelligent, creative, and inspiring, but I found myself disappointed in where the field was and how slowly it seemed to be developing. The most impressive AI systems that could play games like chess were just good at anticipating decisions several moves ahead. No matter how proficient these systems got, no one really believed that they would be intelligent in the same way we are. Artificial neural nets were compelling from a philosophical point of view, but they weren't really capable of doing anything truly mind-blowing at the time. There hadn't been any big, new ideas in twenty or thirty years. Little did I know that this was the tail end of what would later be considered an "AI winter" among researchers.

So I decided to move on. I still loved computer science and thought that I would eventually try to start some type of tech company. But questions around intelligence and, by extension, education continued to draw me in because they seemed so fundamental to the advancing of society. The summer after my junior year, I received a fellowship to create software that allows students to learn and practice math at their own time and pace. Sound familiar?

I started to believe that people had a lot of latent, unused potential. For every person born with the raw material to be Albert Einstein or Marie Curie, how many get the education and support to do so? What if, with broader, more accessible education, we could increase by a factor of ten or one hundred the number of people capable of making the next major scientific, artistic, or entrepreneurial leap for us all? How many more diseases might we cure? How much faster might we explore the cosmos?

My curiosity wasn't just about fostering genius. If everyone had access to truly great education, I wondered, how many more billions of people might attain purpose and meaning in their lives?

But practical reality was there in the background. I grew up in a single-mother household. My parents separated shortly after I was born, and I only met my father once before he died when I was fourteen. He was a pediatrician and came from a prominent family of politicians and academics in Bangladesh, but we never received any financial support because I think he was barely making it himself. When he died, my sister and I inherited a Nissan Sentra that had more debt on it than it was worth. The only narrative I can piece together is that he and my mother were wildly incompatible, as they had an arranged marriage, and he likely suffered from depression. For most of my life, my mother was a cashier at various convenience stores, making enough money to be slightly below the poverty line. MIT was generous with financial aid, but I still had about thirty thousand dollars in debt upon graduation. The tech boom was heating up, and when I found out that I could make eighty thousand dollars a year as a new computer science graduate, which was about five times what my mother was making, I could not pass the opportunity by and took a job at Oracle Corporation.

I later went to business school and found myself as an analyst at a hedge fund. My then fiancée and now wife would give me grief about how I wasn't doing anything helpful for humanity with my talents and education. I found investing to be intellectually fascinating, though. It allowed me to study how the world worked, along with the animal spirits of the market. I also needed the money. I had further debt to pay from business school. I also knew that I was going to support my mother and other family members, and I was pretty determined to not perpetuate the financial insecurity that I grew up with. If I'm honest, I'm still more insecure about this than most of my friends. I would also tell folks that I was only going to do this until I was independently wealthy so that I could start a school on my own terms. I had some ideas about one day being the Dumbledore at a school that focused on putting students at the center and giving much more time and space for them to explore their passions.

It was at that time, in 2004, when I had family from New Orleans visiting me in Boston after my wedding. It came out of a conversation with my aunt that my twelve-year-old cousin Nadia was having trouble in math, and I offered to tutor her remotely. That led to the beginning of Khan Academy, which at its essence has been all about trying to scale the type of personalized learning that I did with Nadia to hundreds of millions of learners, across subjects, grades, and geographies.

Through the years, many people have asked me why I set up Khan Academy as a nonprofit. After all, my previous career was very for-profit, and I live in the middle of Silicon Valley, where scalable tech-enabled solutions can be worth a lot of money. Many have been skeptical whether a nonprofit could even compete with for-profit companies. There were two notions I couldn't get out of my head, however. First, I tend to believe in market forces, but there are a few sectors—namely, education and health care—where the outcomes of market forces don't always align with our values. Education and health care are two areas where our shared values tell us that, ideally, family resources shouldn't be a limiting factor in accessing the best possible opportunities. Most of us believe that every mind and life deserves to reach its full potential.

The second notion was more grandiose, if not outright delusional. One of my favorite sets of books is the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. It takes place tens of thousands of years in the future, when humanity has colonized the galaxy, unified under one empire. Within that empire, an academic by the name of Hari Seldon has developed a new field called psychohistory—something of a combination of history, economics, and statistics—that can probabilistically predict large-scale historic trends. This science tells him that the Galactic Empire will enter a ten-thousand-year dark age within the next few hundred years. This will be ten thousand years of war, famine, and lost knowledge. His calculations show that nothing can prevent the coming dark ages, but it can be shortened. So he starts a foundation at the periphery of the galaxy to preserve knowledge and technology, which can then be used to shorten the coming chaos to "only" one thousand years. The book series mainly focuses on how the ensuing hundreds of years actually play out.

When I first read the Foundation series in middle school, I found it inspiring to think along those time scales. It was also the first moment I truly appreciated that the strength of a civilization doesn't lie in its physical size, power, and wealth. Those are just by-products of where the real strength lies: a society's culture, know-how, and mindset.

Jump ahead to when Khan Academy was beginning, and I realized that very few people in our society think on a scale of more than a few years or decades, much less hundreds or thousands of years. Beyond this, the internet was clearly the transformational technology of our time, but no real institutions were being built with it. I began to wonder whether Khan Academy might just be able to become one of the first of them; something that could help educate billions of people for hundreds of years to come. It would be like Hari Seldon's foundation, except in our case, we could uplift humanity so that the present moment would feel like a dark age when looked back upon from fifty or a hundred years in the future. We only have one life—why not swing for the fences?

As Khan Academy grew and scaled from tens to hundreds of millions of people, that dream seemed to feel less and less delusional. Amazing people came out of the woodwork to help us. By the fall of 2009, I had quit my hedge fund job to work on Khan Academy full time. Ten months later, my family was quickly depleting our savings. Our first child was born, and I was having trouble sleeping because of financial stress and, to some degree, the shame of giving up a lucrative job for something that didn't seem to have a future. At what seemed like Khan Academy's darkest moment, Ann Doerr—who is now our chairperson—and John Doerr miraculously showed up and donated enough money for me to keep going. Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have donated to support us. Despite being a nonprofit, we have been able to build a team that rivals those of the most resource-rich tech companies. Hundreds of incredibly talented people have committed a major part of their careers to be part of the Khan Academy team, often taking considerable pay cuts to do so. Thousands of volunteers all over the world have now translated Khan Academy into over fifty languages. Inspirational leaders like Bill Gates, Reed Hastings, and Elon Musk have become some of our biggest supporters and advocates. This journey seems so serendipitous that it has become something of an inside joke among the Khan Academy team that perhaps benevolent aliens are helping us so that, through education, we can prepare humanity for first contact.

This narrative seemed to be reinforced when Sam Altman and Greg Brockman of OpenAI reached out to us before anyone else with a technology that seemed to tie together every thread of my journey. GPT-4 was built on years of important innovations from many people and companies, but it was the first AI technology that truly made me wonder whether I was dreaming (or perhaps living in a simulation). It surpassed anything that, back in 1994, aspiring AI researcher Sal could have ever imagined happening in his lifetime. More important, it was the potential missing piece to our goal of delivering a truly world-class education for anyone, anywhere. I realized that as thrilling as it would be to be an AI researcher now, it was even more exciting to think about how the technology could be applied to help human potential.

This is not something to be taken lightly; there is real urgency here. Despite making us far more productive as a whole, this technology also has the potential to displace or disrupt many industries and jobs. The traditional labor pyramid—with less-skilled manual labor forming the bottom layer, bureaucratic white-collar jobs making up the middle layer, and highly skilled knowledge work and entrepreneurship making up the top—no longer applies. Robotics, including self-driving cars and trucks, is going to dramatically reduce the need for humans in that bottom layer. Generative AI can clearly perform large aspects of the work of the middle, white-collar layer and even parts of today's most skilled professions. A society in which all the productivity and resulting wealth accrues to only the tippy-top of the traditional labor pyramid, likely concentrated in Silicon Valley, with many others out of work, will not be a stable one. It might lead to massive wealth redistribution efforts. This scenario is dystopian because most people aren't looking for a handout. Rather, they want to have a sense of purpose and a feeling of contributing to the world.

The real solution is to invert that labor pyramid so that most people can operate at the top and use AI and other technology for their own productivity and entrepreneurship. The only way we have a hope of doing this is to use the same AI technology to lift the skills of a large chunk of humanity in the coming decades.

Few people may view the Star Trek universe through an economic lens, but doing so provides a window into a world that might soon be upon us. All of classical economics is based on the notion of scarcity—namely, that there isn't usually enough of anything to give everyone everything they want or need. Because of that, we use markets and pricing to allocate those goods, services, and resources to where they might result in the highest benefit. In Star Trek , however, there isn't much scarcity. Technology has allowed that society to replicate any food they want, transport themselves thousands of miles in the blink of an eye, communicate over light-years, and travel among the stars. All of humanity in that world has been fully educated so that they can participate in this bounty. Everyone is an explorer, researcher, engineer, artist, doctor, or counselor. Generative AI has the potential to allow many dimensions of our own society to be similarly low scarcity or highly abundant. Do we have the will to take us to the utopia of Star Trek?

If we don't, societies will increasingly fall prey to populism. People with time but no sense of purpose or meaning don't tend to be good for themselves or others. They are susceptible to the ideas of demagogues. Generative AI can be used to move us in this negative direction by reinforcing "fake news" with fabricated videos and images. It can be used by governments to police their own populations much more tightly than anything George Orwell imagined in 1984 . For decades it has been possible to put cameras and sensors throughout a city and to tap phone lines, but it was difficult to monitor all the information and make sense of it. AI could soon flag any recording or observation that seems like disobedience to the eyes of the state. Big Brother will not only be watching but will also have comprehension.

Without proper countermeasures and AI literacy, people will also fall victim to increasingly sophisticated fraud. In the near future, expect to get phone calls, or even video chats, from something that looks like your family member, telling you that they are in an emergency and that you need to wire them money.

AI will increasingly play a role in national security. Foreign enemies will have the capability to orchestrate increasingly sophisticated attacks on infrastructure using this technology—attacks that potentially involve manipulating human beings. AI-generated images of people waiting in line to get their deposits could go viral on social media and start a run on banks. State and nonstate actors will use generative AI within social media to try to influence the outcomes of our elections and make us more divided as a society. The best tacticians in the battles of the future are likely to be AI, not human.

These very real possibilities may motivate some to advocate for slowing down innovation. Honestly, even I find the pace of its development dizzying. But the genie is out of the bottle, and the bad actors are not about to slow down because we want them to. Today, the good actors have the edge, but it really is a race. The countermeasure for every risk is not slowing down; it is ensuring that those favoring liberty and empowering humanity have better AI than those on the side of chaos and despotism.

This moment can be an existential risk or an existential opportunity for us. People have every right to be both scared and hopeful of what this leap in technology and innovation means. I do not, however, think our fate is subject to the flip of a coin. Rather, each of us is an active participant in the decision about how we will use AI moving forward. If we act with fear, the rule followers might pause, but the rule breakers, from totalitarian governments to criminal organizations, are going to accelerate their development of AI. The only way that we can ensure that we are closer to reaching a utopian Star Trek scenario is if we double down our efforts on using large language models for the good of society.

This is not a drill: generative AI is here to stay. The AI tsunami has drawn back from the shore, and it is now barreling toward us. Faced with the choice between running from it or riding it, I believe in jumping in with both feet, while taking proper precautions so that we don't get hit with the flotsam.

Each of us has an obligation to make sure that we use this technology responsibly. This means that as developers we must put the necessary guardrails on it to protect our children. When problems arise, we should apply reasonable regulations, regulations that don't give an edge to rule breakers. All the while, we must accelerate our efforts and make sure that we are developing the technology with the right intent and the right pedagogy. This will allow us to accelerate the improvement of human purpose and potential. Let's use AI to create a new golden age for humanity, a time that will make today look like a dark age. From my vantage point, nothing could be more inspiring and important than that.

这让我们在哪里，以及它将带领我们去哪里：一个有教育意义的勇敢呼吁

我要坦白一件事。我曾经以为自己会成为一名 AI 研究员。我认为，并且仍然认为，智能和感知（这两者是不同的）是宇宙中最大的谜团。我被能够构建出像我们一样聪明，甚至比我们更聪明的事物的想法深深吸引。我几乎读过每一本关于这个主题的科幻小说。我喜欢思考我们如何证明另一个存在是真正有感知的。毕竟，我们只能直接感知到自己的感知。其他生物 —— 包括我们身边的人 —— 是真正有感知的，还是仅仅表现得像有感知，这确实是一种信念上的飞跃。我曾经认为，理解智能的最佳方式是构建能够实现智能的机器。

1994 年，当我成为 MIT 的新生时，我很幸运能直接接触到当时几位 AI 领域的巨擘。我找到了 Patrick Henry Winston 成为我的新生顾问。他是 MIT 人工智能实验室的主任，也是当时权威的人工智能教科书的作者。我上了他的《人工智能导论》这门课。我还上了 Marvin Minsky 的《心智社会》这门课。Minsky 是 Winston 的导师，也是人工智能实验室的创始人。他还因「在创造、塑造、推动和发展人工智能领域的核心作用」而获得了计算机科学的最高奖项 —— 图灵奖。他的思想被认为是人工神经网络领域的基础。他还是 Stanley Kubrick 在制作也许是有史以来最著名的 AI 电影《2001：太空漫游》时的 AI 顾问。

这些教授非常聪明、有创造力，并且很有启发性，但我对这个领域的发展现状和进展缓慢感到失望。那些最令人印象深刻的可以玩象棋的 AI 系统，只是擅长预测几步之前的决策。无论这些系统多么熟练，没有人真正相信它们会像我们一样聪明。人工神经网络（Artificial Neural Network）在哲学上很有吸引力，但当时它们实际上无法做任何真正令人惊叹的事情。二三十年来没有任何大的、新的想法出现。我不知道的是，这实际上是后来被研究人员视为「AI 冬天」的尾声。

所以我决定继续前进。我仍然热爱计算机科学，并认为我最终会尝试创办某种科技公司。但有关智能的问题，以及延伸到教育的问题，继续吸引着我，因为它们似乎对社会的进步如此根本。在我大三的那个暑假，我获得了一项奖学金，用来创建可以让学生按照自己的时间和进度学习和练习数学的软件。是不是很熟悉？

我开始相信人们有很多潜在的、未被利用的潜力。对于每一个天生具备成为 Albert Einstein 或 Marie Curie 潜质的人来说，有多少人能得到这样的教育和支持？如果教育更广泛、更易获得，我们是否可以将那些能够为我们所有人做出下一个重大科学、艺术或创业飞跃的人数增加十倍或一百倍？我们可能会治愈更多的疾病吗？我们探索宇宙的速度会增加多快？

我的好奇心不仅限于培养天才。如果每个人都能获得真正优秀的教育，我想知道，会有多少亿更多的人能够在他们的生活中获得目标和意义？

但是，现实情况一直存在于背景中。我在单亲家庭中长大。我的父母在我出生后不久就分开了，在我十四岁时，我只见过父亲一次，然后他就去世了。他是一名儿科医生，来自孟加拉国的一个著名政治家和学者家庭，但我们从未得到过任何经济支持，因为我认为他自己也勉强维持生计。他去世后，我和姐姐继承了一辆尼桑 Sentra，但这辆车的债务比它本身的价值还要多。我能拼凑出的唯一故事是，他和我母亲完全不合适，因为他们是包办婚姻，他可能还患有抑郁症。大部分时间里，我母亲在各种便利店做收银员，收入刚刚低于贫困线。麻省理工学院在经济资助方面很慷慨，但我毕业时仍然欠下了大约三万美元的债务。科技热潮正在升温，当我发现作为一名新计算机科学毕业生可以每年赚八万美元时，这大约是我母亲收入的五倍，我无法错过这个机会，于是我在甲骨文公司找到了工作。

我后来去了商学院，毕业后成为了一家对冲基金的分析师。当时我的未婚妻（现在的妻子）经常责备我没有用学到的知识和技能为社会做贡献。尽管如此，我觉得投资很有趣，它让我了解世界的运作方式和市场的情绪变化。而且我还需要钱来还商学院的债务，并支持我的母亲和其他家庭成员。我下定决心不再像小时候那样经济不稳定。老实说，我在这方面比大多数朋友更不安。我还经常告诉别人，我只会做投资做到财务自由为止，然后创办一所学校。我梦想有一天成为一所学校的「邓布利多」，让学生们有更多时间和空间去探索自己的兴趣。

在 2004 年，我的家人从新奥尔良来到波士顿参加我的婚礼。和我姑妈聊天时，她提到我十二岁的表妹 Nadia 在数学上遇到了困难，我便提议远程辅导她。这就是可汗学院的起源，它的核心理念是将我对 Nadia 的个性化辅导扩展到数百万学习者，覆盖各种学科、年级和地区。

多年来，很多人问我为什么要把可汗学院（Khan Academy）设立为非营利组织。毕竟，我之前的职业是非常注重盈利的，而且我住在硅谷的核心地带，那里技术解决方案的市场价值很高。很多人怀疑非营利组织能否与盈利公司竞争。然而，我始终有两个想法挥之不去。首先，我相信市场力量，但在某些领域 —— 例如教育和医疗 —— 市场的结果并不总是符合我们的价值观。在这些领域，我们的共同价值观认为，家庭资源不应该限制人们获得最佳机会。我们大多数人都相信，每个人的智慧和生命都应该得到最大的开发。

第二个想法更为宏大，甚至有些天马行空。我最喜欢的一套书是 Isaac Asimov 的《基地》系列。故事设定在数万年后的未来，当时人类已经殖民了整个银河系，并在一个帝国的统治下统一。在这个帝国，有个名叫 Hari Seldon 的学者开发了一门新学科，称为心理历史学（psychohistory)，结合了历史、经济学和统计学，能够以概率预测大规模的历史趋势。这门科学告诉他，银河帝国将在未来几百年内进入一个持续一万年的黑暗时代，这将是一个充满战争、饥荒和知识丧失的时期。他的计算表明，虽然无法阻止黑暗时代的到来，但可以缩短它。因此，他在银河系的边缘建立了一个基金会，以保存知识和技术，从而将黑暗时代缩短到「仅仅」一千年。这个系列主要描述了接下来几百年的发展。

当我在初中第一次读《基地》系列时，那些宏大的时间尺度令我深受启发。这也是我第一次真正明白，一个文明的强大并不在于它的物理规模、力量和财富。这些只是其真正力量的副产品，而真正的力量在于社会的文化、知识和心态。

后来，当可汗学院刚刚起步时，我意识到我们的社会中很少有人能以超过几年甚至几十年的时间尺度去思考，更不用说几百或几千年了。同时，互联网显然是我们这个时代的变革性技术，但却没有真正的机构在利用它。我开始思考，可汗学院是否有可能成为这样的机构之一，成为一个能够在未来数百年间帮助数十亿人接受教育的平台。这就像哈里·谢顿的基地一样，只不过在我们的情况下，我们可以提升整个人类，让五十年或一百年后的世界回顾现在时，会发现现在是一个黑暗的时代。我们只有一次生命，为什么不努力追求卓越呢？

随着可汗学院的壮大，从数十人发展到数亿人，这个梦想变得越来越真实。许多杰出的人士纷纷伸出援手。2009 年秋天，我辞去了对冲基金的工作，全职投入到可汗学院。十个月后，我们的积蓄几乎耗尽，第一个孩子也出生了。由于财务压力和放弃高薪工作的羞愧，我常常难以入睡。就在可汗学院最困难的时刻，Ann Doerr（现任主席）和 John Doerr 奇迹般地出现，并捐赠了足够的资金让我继续前行。从那时起，数十万人捐款支持我们。尽管我们是一个非营利组织，但我们组建了一个堪比最富有的科技公司的团队。数百位才华横溢的人士选择将他们职业生涯的重要部分奉献给可汗学院，甚至接受了大幅减薪。全球数千名志愿者已经将可汗学院的内容翻译成五十多种语言。比尔·盖茨、里德·哈斯廷斯和埃隆·马斯克等激励人心的领导者成为了我们的坚定支持者。这段旅程的种种巧合让我们开玩笑说，也许是仁慈的外星人在帮助我们，通过教育为人类的第一次接触做好准备。

当 OpenAI 的 Sam Altman 和 Greg Brockman 最先联系到我们时，他们带来了一项技术，似乎将我整个职业旅程的每个环节都连接在了一起。GPT-4 建立在许多人和公司多年来的重要创新基础上，但它是第一个让我怀疑自己是否在做梦（或者生活在模拟世界中）的 AI 技术。它超出了 1994 年时我作为有抱负的 AI 研究者所能想象的一切。更重要的是，它可能是我们实现为任何人、任何地方提供世界级教育这一目标的关键部分。我意识到，现在成为 AI 研究者固然令人兴奋，但思考如何应用这项技术来挖掘人类潜力更加激动人心。

这不是可以轻视的问题，实际上非常紧迫。尽管这项技术让我们的整体生产力大幅提高，但它也可能取代或颠覆许多行业和工作。传统的劳动金字塔结构 —— 底层是技能较低的体力劳动，中层是办公室白领工作，顶层是高技能的知识工作和创业 —— 已经不再适用。机器人技术，包括自动驾驶汽车和卡车，将大大减少对底层人力的需求。生成式 AI 可以明显地执行中层白领工作的许多任务，甚至包括一些高技能职业的工作。如果一个社会的生产力和由此产生的财富都集中在传统劳动金字塔的顶端，可能主要在硅谷，而许多人失业，那么这个社会将不会稳定。这可能导致大规模的财富再分配。这个前景是反乌托邦的，因为大多数人并不希望接受救济，他们更希望拥有目标感和对世界有所贡献的感觉。

真正的解决方案是让更多人能够在劳动力金字塔的顶端工作，并利用 AI 和其他技术提升他们的生产力和创业能力。我们唯一的希望是利用同样的 AI 技术，在未来几十年内提升大部分人类的技能。

很少有人会从经济学角度看待《星际迷航》宇宙，但这样做可以让我们一窥一个即将到来的世界。所有经典经济学都基于资源稀缺的概念，即通常没有足够的东西来满足每个人的所有需求或愿望。因此，我们使用市场和定价来分配这些商品、服务和资源，以便它们能产生最大的效益。然而，在《星际迷航》中，资源稀缺并不多见。技术使得那个社会可以复制任何他们想要的食物，在瞬间运输自己数千英里，跨越光年进行通信，并在星际间旅行。那个世界中的所有人类都接受了充分的教育，使他们能够参与这份丰盛。每个人都是探险家、研究员、工程师、艺术家、医生或顾问。生成式 AI（Generative AI）有潜力使我们社会的许多方面也变得资源丰富。我们是否有决心实现《星际迷航》中的乌托邦？

如果我们不采取措施，社会将越来越容易受到民粹主义的影响。有闲暇但没有目标或意义的人，往往对自己和他人都没有好处。他们容易受到煽动者的蛊惑。生成式 AI（Generative AI）可能会通过伪造视频和图像来增强「假新闻」，将我们引向这种负面的方向。政府可以利用它来比 George Orwell 在《1984》中描述的更加严格地监控民众。虽然几十年来已经可以在城市中安装摄像头和传感器，并监听电话线，但监控所有信息并理解其内容一直很难。AI 很快就能标记出在国家眼中看似不服从的记录或行为。老大哥不仅在看，还会理解。

如果没有适当的对策和 AI 素养，人们也会成为越来越复杂的欺诈的受害者。未来可能会接到看起来像您家人的电话，甚至视频聊天，告诉您他们遇到紧急情况，需要您汇款。

AI 在国家安全中将扮演越来越重要的角色。外国敌人将能够利用这项技术策划越来越复杂的基础设施攻击，甚至可能涉及操纵人类。AI 生成的排队取款的人的图像可能会在社交媒体上迅速传播，引发银行挤兑。国家和非国家行为者将利用生成式 AI 在社交媒体上试图影响选举结果，使社会更加分裂。未来战斗中最优秀的战术家可能是 AI，而不是人类。

这些现实的可能性可能会让一些人主张放慢创新步伐。老实说，即使是我也觉得它的发展速度令人目眩。但现实是，既然魔瓶已经打开，坏人不会因为我们的意愿而放慢脚步。如今，善良的一方暂时占据优势，但这依然是一场竞赛。应对每个风险的办法不是减速，而是要确保支持自由和人类进步的人拥有比那些支持混乱和专制的人更先进的 AI。

当前的时刻对我们来说既可能是存在的风险，也可能是存在的机遇。面对这次技术和创新的飞跃，人们既有理由感到害怕，也有理由充满希望。然而，我不认为我们的命运是靠运气决定的。实际上，我们每个人都是未来如何使用 AI 的积极决策者。如果我们因为恐惧而停滞，那么从专制政府到犯罪组织的破坏者将加速他们的 AI 发展。我们唯一能确保接近乌托邦《星际迷航》情景的方法，就是加倍努力将大语言模型用于社会的利益。

这不是演习：生成式 AI（Generative AI）已经成为现实。AI 海啸已经退去，现在正向我们席卷而来。面对逃避还是驾驭的选择，我相信我们应该全力以赴，同时采取适当的预防措施，以免被漂浮物击中。

我们每个人都有责任确保负责任地使用这项技术。这意味着，作为开发者，我们必须为其设置必要的防护措施来保护我们的孩子。当问题出现时，我们应该施加合理的监管，不让违规者占到便宜。同时，我们必须加快努力，确保我们以正确的意图和方法开发这项技术。这将使我们能够加速提升人类的目标和潜力。让我们利用 AI 为人类创造一个新的黄金时代，一个将今天视为黑暗时代的时期。从我的角度来看，没有什么比这更鼓舞人心和重要的了。
