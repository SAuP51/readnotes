# 0103. Resources, Hierarchy, Networks, and Homophily

The Structural Foundation

It has been proposed that social capital, as an investment in social relations with an expected return in the marketplace, should be defined as resources embedded in a social structure that are accessed and/or mobilized in purposive actions . In this definition, three critical components present themselves for analysis: (1) the resources, (2) being embedded in a social structure, and (3) action. I contend that resources are at the core of all capital theories, especially social capital. A theory of social capital should accomplish three tasks: First, it should explain how resources take on values and how the valued resources are distributed in society –

the structural embeddedness of resources. Second, it should show how individual actors, through interactions and social networks, become differentially accessible to such structurally embedded resources – the opportunity structure. Third, it should explain how access to such social resources can be mobilized for gains – the process of activation. This chapter will focus on the first two of these tasks: embeddedness of valued resources in society and the opportunity structure relative to such resources. Chapter 4 will conclude the explication of the theory by discussing the action component.

## 3.1 Resources and Their Social Allocation

A fundamental concept of the theory presented here is resources, defined as material or symbolic goods (Lin 1982).1 Beyond the basic physical resources needed to sustain and enhance human life, individuals and groups ascribe meanings and significance to other resources as well.

1 Sewell (1992, p. 9) identified two types of resources in structure: nonhuman and human resources. While nonhuman resources are consistent with physical resources, human resources include both physical (physical strength, dexterity) and symbolic (knowledge, emotional commitment) resources.

Here, three principles are proposed as assumptions about how meanings and significance are assigned to resources.

First, in any human group or community,  differential values are  assigned by consensus or influence to resources  to signal their relative significance (Lin 1982). Value assignment of a resource is dictated in part by its scarcity relative to the demand or expectations for it (e.g., gold in one society or seashells in another). But it is also determined by the unique historical, geographical, and collective experiences of each group.

The assignment of values to resources may be achieved through one of three processes of influence: persuasion, petition, or coercion (Lin 1973; and see related discussions in Kelman 1961 and Parsons 1963).

Persuasion  is a process by which fellow actors are convinced, through communication and interaction, of the merit of a resource, resulting in the internalization of the value of a resource among the actors. Members supposedly see the intrinsic value of a resource. Persuasion results in assigning value to a resource without the threat or imposition of external sanction or punishment.  Petition  indicates the appeal or lobbying of a group of individual actors and represents normative pressure. Individual actors accept the value of a resource because they wish to remain members of a group or identify with the group, and they are willing to accept what the group’s values even if they do not understand or accept the resource’s intrinsic merit.  Coercion  is the process by which fellow actors are forced to recognize the merit of a resource or face certain sanction or punishment. Individual actors do not see the intrinsic value of a resource or voluntarily accept its value because they wish to identify with the group. Rather, they are confronted with either recognizing the authoritative assignment of value or suffering undesirable consequences (physical or mental harm, for example).

The assigned value of a resource may change due to internal (civil war, revolution, upheaval, disaster, authoritative revision, discoveries, changes in fashion or taste, etc.) and external (trade, war, invasion, con-quest, exchange of ideas, etc.) forces. For example, the status of females, while universally distinct, is expressed differently in different communities and epochs. For women in the Qing dynasty of imperial China, bound feet signaled high status; the smaller the foot, the more highly the lady was regarded. For women in mid-twentieth-century Europe and North America, high heels similarly signaled high status. Both resources are valuable in their respective contexts and time, perhaps for women to attract mates who have other valued resources. While the value of each resource is time-bound, some resources are more enduring or universal (e.g., money, ethnic or racial ranking, pierced body parts) than others (e.g., bound feet, kilts for men, and wigs for judges or high priests).

Second, we assume that  all actors will take actions to promote their  self-interests by maintaining and gaining valued resources if such opportunities are available.  An  actor  here is either an individual or a collective group. The collectivity, or the community, promotes its self-interest by conferring relatively higher statuses on individual actors who possess more valued resources. There is a good reason why the collectivity would confer such status on or「empower」(Sewell 1992) individual actors. It reinforces the social consensus of the collectivity on the values of the resources – a sense of community. It is a reward to an individual actor for his or her demonstrated adherence to the social consensus on the assigned values. The status conferral serves to promote the unity, and thus the survival and persistence, of the collectivity. Conferred status further reinforces the loyalty to the collectivity of the individual actors in possession of the valued resource, because it confirms and protects the values of the resources. Thus, status conferral for possession of valued resources promotes the mutual interests of the community and the participating individual actors.

The reciprocal relationship between the persistence of a community and its conferral of status on individual actors possessing valuable resources has important consequences for collective action. Individual actors holding more valued resources, and therefore higher standings, tend to be given the opportunity to make decisions on behalf of or in the name of the collectivity, including ways to allocate and distribute the valued resources. Such an opportunity is offered by assigning to these individual actors decision-making positions in the collectivity. This structural opportunity will be discussed further in the next section on the macrostructure of resources. In any case, the consequence is that individual actors in possession of valued resources are more likely to be involved in decisions regarding the rights (use, transfer, disposition) of these resources (e.g., valued properties).2 Actors in decision-making positions are expected to reinforce the community consensus, because there is an incentive for them to sustain and promote their standing in the community. Self-interest is thus served because it is consistent with collective interest. These powerful individual actors can further advance their standing by either gaining more valued resources, or manipulating value consensus to promote the value of resources that they possess or can access. Higher positions in the collectivity offer more opportunities to promote self-interest.

On the other hand, individual actors with less valued resources and 2 For a discussion of property rights, see Alchian (1965), Alchian and Demsetz (1973), Gilham (1981), and Willer (1985). For the relationships between property rights and class structures, see Dahrendorf (1959), Bourdieu (1986), and Kornai (1992).

thus lower standings in the community experience greater structural constraints and less opportunities to innovate. There are two types of actions these individuals can take: either appropriate more valued resources or change the values assigned to various resources. Appropriation of valued resources can employ means legitimated and sanctioned by the community, that is, institutionalized channels such as going through the educational system. Or it can employ means not sanctioned or considered legitimate by the community, that is, deviant actions. Merton (1940), in his work on social structure and anomie, has theorized how individual actors can violate group norms to achieve individual goals.

To change the values of resources requires more than individual actions; it needs the mobilization of other actors who make similar demands. Such mobilization can range from the formation of social networks promoting alternative value assignments to resources to revolu-tions that aim to replace the community’s decision makers (for further discussion, see Chapter 11).

These deviant actions, of course, risk sanctions from the community.

Sanctions may range from demotion in community standing (incarcera-tion or deprivation of valued resources and higher status) to expulsion.

Such is the force of structure on individual actors to act responsibly. Yet, the fact remains that structural constraints and opportunities go hand in hand (Merton 1995). The focal point, for both individuals and the community, remains contention for valued resources, and actions are taken to promote self-interest by gaining and preserving such resources.

In ordinary times, when actions and interactions are carried out routinely, the significance of the constraint–opportunity synergy is not clear to the actors themselves, since the decisions seem to be made by the collectivity’s invisible hand for the well-being of every member. It becomes more explicit when the community’s survival is challenged. In time of external crisis, a unified community follows a strategy that protects those with the most valued resources and sacrifices those with the least valued resources. In facing an external threat, for example, a collectivity would tend to let go the non–decision makers first or in higher proportions, while the managers who authorize or control such layoffs tend to survive unless the collectivity is on the verge of collapse. During the waning phase of World War II, Japan sent its low-ranking and younger pilots on kamikaze missions while holding back the higher-ranked and more experienced pilots in preparation for the final battle to defend the motherland.

Preservation of the community and preservation of individual actors in possession of valued resources are mutually serving and sustaining.

The third principle regarding valued resources assumes that  maintaining and gaining valued resources are the two primary motives for  action, with the former outweighing the latter (Lin 1994a). Both the community and its individual actors strive, first, to maintain the valued resources they possess or to which they can gain access. Only when the existing valued resources are secured do actors seek to gain additional valued resources. There are secondary and peripheral motives for actions; however, we assume that these two motives are primary and dictate the overwhelming proportion of actions. A further deliberation on the significance of this principle and its consequences for action will appear in Chapter 4.

资源及其社会分配

这里提出的社会资本理论的基本概念是资源，可以定义为物质或符号物品（Iin,1982)。円除了维持和提高人类生活所需的基本物质资源之外，个人和群体也将其他资源赋予意义和重要性。这里，提出三个关于资源如何被赋予意和重要性的假定。

休厄尔（1992, p9) 区分了结构中的两种类型的资源：非人力资源和人力资源。非人力资源与物质资源相一致，人力资源既包括体质资源（体力、熟练），又包括符号资源（知识、情感投入）

第一，在任何人类群体或社区中，为表明资源的相对重要性，资源被共识或影响斌予不同的价值（Lin,1982)。一种资源的价值赋予，部分是由对它的需求或预期的相对稀缺性来规定（如一个社会中的黄金或另一个社会中的贝壳）。但是它也由每一个群体的独特的历史、地理和集体经验来决定。

对资源的价值赋予可以通过三个影响过程之一来实现：劝服、请愿或强制（Lin,1973; 参见 Kelman,1961, Parsons,1963 的相关讨论）。劝服是通过交流和互动，使同类行动者确信一种资源的价值的过程，从而导致资源的价值在行动者之中内化。成员能看到这种资源的内在价值。劝服是在没有外部制裁或惩罚的威胁或强迫之下，将资源赋予价值。请愿表明一群个体行动者的请求或游说活动，代表着规范的压力。个体行动者接受一种资源的价值，是因为他们希望保持一个群体的成员身份或认同这个群体，即使他们不能理解或接受资源的内在价值，也愿意接受这个群体的价值。强制是同类行动者被迫认可一种资源的价值，否则会面临着某种制裁或惩罚。个体行动者没有看到这种资源的内在价值，也没有因为他们希望认同这个群体才不自愿地接受它的价值。而是，他们要么认可权威性的价值赋予，要么遭受令人不快的后果（如身体的或精神的伤害）。

种源被赋予的价值可能由于内部影响（内战、革命、剧变、灾难、权威的修正、发现、时尚或品味的变化等）和外部影响（贸易、战争、入侵、征服、思想的交流等）而改变。例如，女性的地位到处都不同，在不同的社会、不同的时期有不同的体现。在清朝，女人缠足表示地位高；脚越小，地位越高。在 20 世纪中叶的欧洲和北美，女人穿高跟鞋同样显示高地位。女人可能有其他有价值的资源来吸引男性，但是这两种资源在它们各自的背景和时间内都是有价值的。虽然每一种资源的价值都是有时间约束的，但是一些资源（如金钱、族群或种族的等级、身体的穿孔部分）的价值比其他资源（如缠足、苏格兰男子的褶裥短裙、法官或高级牧师的假发套更持久或更普遍。

第二，我们假定，如果有机会，所有行动者都会采取行动维持和获得有价值资源，以促进他们的自我利益。这里，行动者是个体或者由个体组成的

群体。集体或社区通过投予拥有较多有价值资源的个体行动者以相对高的地位，来促进它的自我利益。有一个很好的原因可以说明，集体为什么会授予个体行动者这些地位或「授权」（Sewell,1992)。它强化了集体关于资源价值的社会性共识 一一 一种社区感。个体行动者如果显示出对赋予价值的社会共识的信奉，就会得到报酬。地位的授予有利于促进集体的统一、生存和持续。被授予的地位进一步强化了拥有有价值资源的个体行动者对集体的忠诚，因为它肯定和保护了资源的价值。这样，对有价值资源的拥有授予地位，促进了社区和参与其中的个体行动者的相互利益。

社区的持续与它对拥有有价值资源的个体行动者的地位的授予之间的互关系，是集体行动的重要结果。拥有更多有价值资源的个体行动者一因此拥有更高的地位 一一 往往代表集体或以集体的名义作出决定，包括决定有价值资源的分配方法。这样一个机会通过赋予集体中的个体行动者以决策位置而产生。这样的结构机会我在下一部分，资源的宏观结构中进一步讨论。无论如何，结果是，拥有有价值资源的个体行动者更有可能参与这些资源（如有价值的财产）的权利（使用、转让、处置）有关的决策。处于决策位置的行动者希望强化集体共识，因为存在一个维持和提高他们在集体中地位的励。这样，自我利益被满足，因为它与集体利益相一致。这些有权利的个体行动者，可以通过获得更多有价值的资源，或者操纵价值共识，以提高他们已经拥有的或能够获取的资源的价值，从而进一步抬高他们的地位。在集体中的地位越高，增加自我利益的机会也就更多。

另一方面，在社区中拥有较少有价值资源和较低地位的个体行动者，会体验到较大的结构性约束并且改变机会也较少。这些个体可以采取两种类型的行动：要么占用更多有价值的资源，要么改变对各种资源所予的价值。对有价值资源的占用可以使用社区合法的和准许的手段，也即经过制度化的渠道，如通过教育体系。或者可以使用社区不准许的或非法的手段，也即越轨

对所有权的讨论，参见 Alchian (1965), Alchian and Demsetz (1973), Gilham (1981), and Willet (1985)。对于财产权和阶级结构之间的关系，参见 Dahrendorf (1959), Bourdieu (1986），和 Komai (1992)

行动。默顿（Merton,1940) 在关于社会结构与失范的著作中，闻述了个体行动者如何通过违反群体的规范来实现个人目标的理论。

改变资源的价值要超越个体的行动，需要动员有相似需求的其他行动者。这样的动员，或形成社会网络来促进对资源价值重新评价，或以取代社区的决策者为目标的革命（进一步的讨论，参见第十ー章），不一而足。

当然，这些越轨行动冒着遭受社区制裁的风险。制裁的范围可从降低行动者社区中的地位（监禁或剥夺有价值的资源与高地位）到驱逐他们出社区不等。这就是结构对个体行动者行动的约束力量。然而，结构性约束与机会并存的事实仍然存在（Merton,1995)。无论对个人还是对社区而言，关键的是对有价值资源的争夺，以及通过获得和保持这些资源来促进自我利益。

在一般的情况下，当行动和互动按常规进行时，行动者本身并不清楚「约束一机会」协同作用的重要性，因为决策好像是由集体的看不见的手为了每一个成员的福利作出的。当社区的生存受到挑战时，真实的情况才会变得更凊楚。在遇到外来的危机时，统一的社区会采取措施保护那些拥有最有价值资源的成员，而牺牲那些拥有最少价值资源的成员。例如，在面临一个外部威胁时，集体倾向于或者说以更高的比例先辞退不在决策地位的成员，而批准或控制这些裁员的管理人员会留下来。直到集体处于崩溃的边缘。在战接近尾声时，日本派级别低的年轻飞行员去完成自杀性的使命，而保留高级的有经验的飞行员准备保卫本土的最后一搏就是一例。集体的保存与拥有有价值资源的个体行动者的保存是相互作用和相互支撑的。

关于有价值资源的第三个原则假定：维持和获得有价值资源是行动的两个主要动机，前者比后者更重要（Lin,1994a）。无论对于社区还是对于它的个体行动者而言，首先是努力维持它们拥有的或者能够得到有价值资源。只有当现有的有价值资源得到保证时，行动者才会去寻找获得另外的有价值资源。行动也存在其他次要的动机，但是，我们假定这两个动机是主要的，它们支配着绝大部分的行动。第四章将对这个原则的重要性以及它对行动的影响进行进一步研究。



## 3.2 The Macrostructure of Resources: Hierarchies and Social Positions

Once resources are defined and their values and significance assumed, we next consider how resources are embedded in the collectivity. The following description below focuses on several topics: (1) the nature of a social structure, (2) the hierarchy in a social structure, (3) the pyramidal shape of the hierarchical structure, and (4) complex social structures and resource transactions.

### Social Structure

A  social structure  is here defined as consisting of (1) a set of social units ( positions ) that possess differential amounts of one or more types of valued resources and that (2) are hierarchically related relative to  authority (control of and access to resources), (3) share certain  rules  and procedures in the use of the resources, and (4) are entrusted to  occupants ( agents ) who  act on  these rules and procedures (for related discussion, see Sewell 1992).

The first element links the embeddedness of resources to social positions (for a discussion of the positional view of structure, see Burt 1992).

The occupant of a position may change, but the resources are attached to the position. Therefore, resources embedded in a structure are distinguished from resources possessed by individual actors. A structure remains stable as long as the positions with their embedded resources persist (Weber 1947).

The second element describes relations among the positions.  Authority  is one form of power, defined as the relative control over and access to the valued resources (see discussion of this definition in Emerson 1962; Cook and Emerson 1978; Bourdieu 1983/1986; Coleman 1990, pp.

780–782), identifying the relative ranking between any pair of positions.

Authority implies coercion, with explicit legalistic sanctions. A structure is more hierarchical the more the relative authority among its positions differs.

The third element describes the shared procedures and rules guiding how positions (and the agents) ought to act and interact relative to the use and manipulation of valued resources (for a discussion of rules in structure, see Sewell 1992).3 The rules and procedures lead to uniform actions and interactions among social positions, so that the value of the resources is upheld and maintaining and expanding such resources remain the purposes of collective actions.

The final element is the occupants of these positions, which highlights the fact that they are expected to behave in accordance with these rules and procedures. Thus, social structure, with its rules and procedures, represents the principle, and the individual actors who occupy positions and are empowered to act out the rules and procedures are the agents. This is a very important principle and a paradox as well. On the one hand, enactment of the rules and procedures is critical to the persistence of the structure, so that selection of occupants favors those who are socialized and trained to carry out these rules and procedures. On the other hand, because occupants must carry out these rules and procedures, individual actors in these positions gain opportunities to act according to their own interpretations. The paradox is that while these occupants are favored because of their skills and knowledge, and the expectation that they will carry out the rules and procedures that sustain the community, these agents are also given opportunities to act according to their whims –

a reliance on their ability and willingness to interpret「properly」and act effectively and creatively. This agency principle (for a discussion of agency and agents in structure, see Sewell 1992) runs the risk that occupants may consider interests other than those of the collectivity in their interpretations or err in applying the rules and procedures to actual situations.

These four elements –  positions, authority, rules,  and  agents –

collectively define the social macrostructure as a system of coordination for the maintenance and/or acquisition of one or more types of valued resources for the collectivity.

### Hierarchical Structure

In general, social structures and their resource(s) can be classified over a continuum of differential explicitness in resources, positions, authority, 3 Rules and procedures exist beyond the social structure described here. In a larger society, the shared, understood, and largely consensual「ways of thinking and doing things」or

「rules of the game」form culture or institutions (see Bourdieu 1972/1977; Meyer and Rowan 1977; North 1990; Scott and Meyers 1994; Lin 1994b). Also see Chapter 11.

rules, and agents. The formalization of a social structure is characterized by the extent to which these elements are made explicit, and inclusive and exclusive criteria are well understood in terms of valued resources, positions, authority, rules and procedures, and occupants.4 It is impossible to identify the full range, and thus all types, of social structures in terms of their formality. In general, and stereotypically, the degree of formalization of social structures ranges from so-called formal organizations or hierarchical structures (e.g., firms, corporations, and agencies) to voluntary associations and clubs and to informal social networks.5

We will focus on the more formally organized and hierarchical social structures. Differentiation between formal organizations and less formal structures such as social networks will emerge as the discussion warrants.

In hierarchical structures, positions are linked in a chain of authoritative command, where higher and more powerful positions not only dictate the behaviors of occupants of less powerful positions by instructing and socializing them as to how to interpret rules and procedures, but also dispose of these lower positions, discharge occupants, and reallocate embedded resources, as dictated by explicit rules and procedures or interpretations of the former by occupants in higher positions. The rules and procedures, in principle, are legalized in that they are usually enforceable, with the approval of and even enforcement by the larger community (e.g., the state); punitive actions can be taken against violations or deviations. The occupants are designated in contract relationships and can be dismissed under rules (Weber 1946, 1947).

A simple formal structure is therefore defined as a hierarchical structure consisting of a set of positions linked in authority (legitimately coercive) relations (command chains) over the control and use of certain valued resources. The relative rank ordering of positions in terms of access to valued resources can be determined by their vertical location in the authority hierarchy. A position higher up in the hierarchy, by definition, can exercise authority over lower positions. Just as important, the higher positions have more information about the locations of valued resources in the hierarchy – where specific types and amounts of resources are embedded. In other words, the higher the position in the hierarchical structure, the better information it provides of the structure’s resources.

Lateral positions  are defined as those endowed with authority over a similar amount of resources in a simple social structure. These positions 4 It is theoretically possible to have a social structure with the specific criterion of「no criteria of exclusion and inclusion.」This case, for our purposes here, is equivalent to no formal or rigid criterion.

5  Institutions , in this volume, will be defined as sets of rules and procedures used by various social structures (see Chapter 11).

can also form relationships with each other because they offer opportunities for information exchanges about the location and availability of resources in different positions. Such information facilitates better control and manipulation of a position’s resources, and access that ensures the maximal likelihood of preserving and/or gaining resources.

Transactions over resources can take place among these lateral positions when they are authorized to do so, or when rules and procedures do not prevent such exchanges and are not interpreted as sabotaging higher authority in the command chain. Horizontal linkages become especially relevant when collective action is geared to massing or combining available resources in the structure.

### The Pyramid of a Hierarchy

Another assumption about the macrostructure of resources is that there is a general tendency for the hierarchical structure to have a pyramidal shape in terms of position distribution: the higher the level in the command chain, the fewer the number of positions and occupants (Lin 1982). The inverse relationship between the number of positions and their command of other positions is assumed for most social structures.

However, many evolving structures show a smaller bottom level than expected by this image, as industrialization and technological development continue to define or redefine the values of resources and to re-distribute positions and occupants accordingly. For example, in most industrialized societies, there is only a small segment of agricultural production and positions at the bottom of the command hierarchy.

An important consequence of pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures is that authority is concentrated in a few positions and occupants. At the very top, only a few positions and occupants not only command the largest absolute and relative amounts of valued resources, but also have the most comprehensive information on the location of resources in the structure.

### Transactions in Complex Social Structures 

Any existing social structure reflects a complexity that involves multiple hierarchical structures over many different kinds of valued resources. For most collectivities, the highly valued resources are associated with economic, social, and political dimensions. For example, Weber (1946) identifies three dimensions of「power」distribution in a community:  classes , status groups , and  parties . Because other terms have also been used in the literature regarding resources distributed in society and among indi-

vidual actors, a clarification of how these terms are defined and used in this monograph is needed.

Valued resources are distributed in three dimensions (social, economic, and political) and can characterize structural positions and individual actors. These characterizations are specified in Table 3.1.

For example, a socially highly regarded structural position can be characterized as a high-status「group.」Correspondingly, individual actors are considered as having better or worse reputations.6 Positions in possession of valued economic resources are considered upper class, and individuals occupying these positions are wealthy actors. Positions higher up in a hierarchical command structure are seen as more authoritative, and individual occupants are labeled as powerful.7

In any event, the theory assumes that while the uneven distribution of various valued resources forms the basis of hierarchical structures, and each valued resource defines a particular hierarchy, these hierarchies have a tendency toward congruence and transferability. That is, there tends to be a correspondence of occupants among hierarchical positions across valued resource or status dimensions. An occupant in a position of relatively high standing with respect to one resource also tends to occupy a relatively high position with respect to other resources. For example, a person with relatively high standing (status) in the occupational structure is also likely to hold a high position in the class and authority dimensions.

6  Prestige  has been used in the sociological literature to represent both statuses of positions (e.g., occupational prestige) and statuses of individuals. To avoid this confusion, and for important theoretical reasons (see Chapter 9), I choose the term  reputation  as an indicator of social standing for individuals.

7 Ambiguity concerning the term  power  remains. As used by Weber, it means general control over resources in a structural sense. For others (e.g., Emerson and Cook), power indicates the extent to which an individual actor, relative to other actors, controls alternative sources of resources. To avoid confusion, power is used in this volume as a characterization of individual actors or occupants.

When such convergence is not functionally complete (i.e., a one-to-one relationship), exchange of resources across dimensions is not only possible but, in most societies, is explicit and expected. For example, an occupant with power resources can negotiate and trade with an occupant with wealth resources to acquire some of the latter’s wealth in exchange for lending power to the latter. The calculus of such transfers is usually institutionalized (with rules and procedures understood and practiced by individual actors) in a social structure.


资源的宏观结构：等级制与社会位置（position)

在对资源下定义和假定它们的价值和重要性之后，我们下一步考虑资源如何嵌入在集体中。下面的论述集中在以下几个主题：(1) 社会结构的性质；(2) 社会结构中的等级制；(3) 等级制结构的金字塔形状；(4) 复杂的社会结构与资源交易。

社会结构

这里界定的社会结构由以下部分组成：(1) 拥有不同数量的一种或多种有价值资源的一组社会单位（位置）; (2) 相对于权威（控制和获取资源）这些社会单位是按等级联系的；(3) 在资源的使用中，它们共享某些规则和程序；(4) 它们被委托于按这些规则和程序行动的占据者（代理人）（相关讨论，参见 Sewell,1992)。

第一个要素将资源的嵌入性与社会位置联系起来（对结构位置的观点的讨论，参见 Burt,192)。位置的占据者可以改变，但是资源却依附在位置上。因此，嵌在结构中的资源不同于个体行动者所拥有的资源。只要位置拥有的嵌入性资源存在，结构就会保持稳定（Weber,1947)。

第二个要素描述了位置之间的关系。权威是权力的一种形式，可以定义为对有价值资源的相对控制和获取机会（这个定义的讨论，参见 Emerson, 1962; Cook Emerson, 1978; Bourdieu, 1983/1986; Coleman, 1990, pp 780-782) 可以在任何一对位置之间确认相对的等级。权威意味着拥有明确的法律制裁的强制。一个结构的等级越多，其位置之间的相对权威越不同。

第三个要素描述了共享的程序和规则，在有价值资源的使用与控制中，

* 本章中关于 position 和 location 的译法，请参见第二章译注注脚。一中译注

它们指导着位置（与代理人）应该如何行动和互动（关于结构中的规则的讨论，参见 Sewell,1992) 이规则和程序使社会位置之间的行动和互动导向致，因此资源的价值得以维护，维持和扩展这些资源仍然是集体行动的目的

最后一个要素是这些位置的占据者，他们被期待着按这些规则和程序行动。因此，社会结构以及它的规则和程序代表着原则；而个体行动者是代理人，他们占有位置并被授权将规则和程序付诸实施。这是一个非常重要的原则，也是一个矛盾。一方面，规则和程序的制定对于结构的持续非常关键因此对占据者的选择偏向于那些经过社会化和培训的、能够执行这些规则和程序的人。另一方面，因为占据者必须执行这些规则和程序，所以处在这些位置的个体行动者获得了按照自己的解释行动的机会。矛盾在于，虽然这些占据者因其技能和知识而被偏爱，并且被期待着执行支持社区的规则和程序，但是这些代理人也被给予了按照他们的念头行动的机会一依赖于他们「适当地」解释和有效地、有创造力地行动的能力和意愿。这个代理原则（对结构中代理与代理人的讨论，参见 Sewell,1992) 冒着这样的风险：占据者在他们的解释中可能考虑的不是集体的利益；或者，在将规则和程序运用到实际情境中时出现错误。

这四个要素位置、权威、规则和代理人一共同界定了社会的宏观结构：一个为维持集体资源，并且 / 或者获得一种或多种有价值资源的协调体系

等级制结构

社会结构与它们的资源通常可以归为ー个在资源、位置、权威、规则和代理人上有不同表现的连续体中。一个社会结构的正式化以这些要素的表现

规则和程序的存在超越这里所描述的社会结构。在一个更大的社会中，共享的、可以理解的和大量的地达成共识的「想事情和做事情的方法」或「游戏的规则」，组成了文化或制度（参见 Bourdieu,1972/1977: Meyer 和 Rowan,1977 North,10Scot 和 Meyers, 1994; Jin,1994b）。也参见第十一章。

程度为特征，即是对于有价值资源、位置、权威、规则和程序以及占据者各方面，哪些应包含，哪些应排除有很好的理解。确定社会结构形式的全部范围与所有类型是不可能的。通常地，社会结构正式化的程度，从所谓的正式组织或等级制结构（如公司、机构）到自愿性社团和俱乐部，再到非正式的社会网络而不同。在这里，我们主要关注正式的组织和等级制社会结构。我们会以正式组织与较少正式性的结构（如社会网络）的区分为根据进行讨论。

在等级制结构中，位置被权威控制链连接起来。在控制链中，占有较高和较有权力位置的占据者，不仅通过教导和社会化来支配较少权力位置的占据者的行为，指导他们如何解释规则和程序；而且按照明确的规则和程序的规定，或者更高位置占据者对前者的解释，来处置这些低位置、解雇其占据者、重新分配嵌入性资源。规则和程序在原则上是合法的，因为它们通常是在更大的共同体（如国家）的同意、甚至是强制下实施的；违反或越轨会受到惩罚。占据者根据契约关系被任命，在规则下被解职 Weber,1946,1947)。

个单一的正式结构可以定义为：由一套与权威（合法的强制）关系（控制链）对某些有价值资源进行控制和使用 一一 相连接的位置组成的等级制结构。位置在获取有价值资源机会上的相对等级序列，由它们在权威等级中的纵向位置决定。根据定义，等级制中的高位置可以对低位置行使权力。重要的是，更高的位置拥有更多的关于等级制中特定类型与数量的资源嵌入其中 一一 有价值资源位置的信息。换言之，在等级制结构中的位置越高，它可获得有关于结构资源的信息就越好。

横向位置（Lateral positions）可以定义为：在一个单一的社会结构中对相似数量的资源拥有权威的位置。这些位置彼此之间也可以形成关系，因为它们提供了关于位置（location）和不同位置的资源可利用性的信息交换机

[4]「没有排除和包含标准」这种特别标准的社会结构在理论上是可能的。这种情况这里为了我们的需要，相当于没有正式的或硬性的标准。

[5 在本书中，制度定义为在不同社会结构中使用的一套规则和程序（参见第十ー 章）



会。这些信息有助于更好地控制、操纵和获取一个位置的资源，以保证最大可能地保持和 / 或获得资源。当这类交换被准许，或者当规则和程序并没有阻止这些交换，或者它们没有被解释为破坏控制链中的更高权威时，资源交易便在这些横向位置中发生。当集体必须集中或组合结构中可利用的资源时，横向联系变得特别有意义。

等级制金字塔

关于资源的宏观结构的另一个假定是，在等级制结构的位置分布中存在个金字塔形状的一般趋向：在控制链中的层次越高，位置与占据者的数量越少（Iin,1982)。对大多数社会结构而言，位置的数量与它们对其他位置的控制之间存在着相反的关系。然而，随着工业化和技术发展对资源价值不断地定义或再定义，以及相应地对位置与占据者的重新分配，许多演化而来的结构显示出比金字塔图要小的底层。例如，在大多数工业化社会中，农业生产和位置在控制等级底部只占很小一部分。

金字塔形状的等级制结构的一个重要后果是，权威集中在很少的位置与占据者中。在顶层只有很少的位置与占据者，它们不仅控制着最多的绝对和相对数量的有价值资源，而且拥有结构中关于资源位置的最全面信息。

复杂社会结构中的交易

任何现存的社会结构都反映了包含多种不同种类有价值资源的多重等级制结构的复杂性。对大多数集体而言，非常有价值的资源与经济的、社会的和政治的维度联系在一起。例如，韦伯（Weber,1946) 确定了一个社区中「权力」分布的三个维度：阶级、地位群体和政党。因为其他术语也在关于资源在社会与个体行动者中分布的著作中使用，因此需要对这些术语在本书中的定义和使用进行澄清。

有价值资源分布在三个维度（社会的、经济的和政治的）中，并且可以描绘结构位置与个体行动者的特征。这些特征在表 3.1 中有详细说明

例如，在社会上被认为是很高的结构位置可以用高地位「群体」来描绘。相应地，个体行动者被认为拥有较好的或较差的名誉。이拥有有价值的经济资源的位置被认为是上层阶级，占有这些位置的个人是有财富的行动者。在等级控制结构中位置越高，权威越多，个人占据者权力越大

不管怎样，我们假定各种有价值资源的不均匀分布形成了等级制结构的基础，每一种有价值资源限定了一个特定的等级制，同时这些等级制又有朝致性和可转换性发展的趋向。也即，不同有价值资源或地位维度的等级制位置中的占据者趋向于一致。在一种资源方面拥有相对高水平的位置的占据者，也倾向于在其他资源方面占据相对高的位置。例如，一个人在职业结构中拥有相对高的位置，可能在阶级和权威维度上也拥有高位置。

当这样的趋同在功能上不完全（也即不能是一对一的关系）时，跨维度的资源交换不仅可能，而且在大多数社会中是很易见、并被期待的。例如，一个权力资源的占有者，可以与一个财富资源的占有者进行谈判和交易，前者通过让渡权力给后者以获得其财富。这些转换的计算在一个社会结构中通常是制度化的（随着规则和程序被个体行动者所理解和实践）。

6] 声望（prestige）在社会学著作中用来代表位置的地位（如职业声望）和个人的地位。为了避免这个混乱，更重要的是理论上的原因（参见第九章），我选择名 reputaton）作为个人社会地位的指标。

[기关于权カ一词的模糊性涵义仍然存在。韦伯使用的权力是指在结构意义上对资源的一般控制。对于其他学者（如 Emerson 和 Cook），权力表示个体行动者相对于其他行动者控制资源的可供选择的来源的程度。为了避免混乱、权力在本书中作为个体行动者或占据者的特征来使用。

## 3.3 Interaction and Homophily: Networking and Social Capital

Social networks represent a less formal social structure in that there is little or no formality in delineating positions and rules and in allocating authority to participants. In social networks, fluidity characterizes the occupants, positions, resources, and rules and procedures. Mutual agreement through persuasion rather than authority or coercion dictates the actors’ participation and interaction, and defines the boundary and locations (positions) of participants’ (nodes). A particular network may evolve naturally or may be socially constructed for a particular shared focus or interest regarding a resource (e.g., protection of the environment, women’s rights). However, in general, a social network may be constructed for multiple interests in its different segments –

different interests link nodes in different parts of the network. Being in a node of a network directly and indirectly provides potential access to other nodes (actors) in the social network. Resources embedded in these nodes become ego’s social capital. As already pointed out, social capital reflects more than the mere personal resources of those nodes in the network. Since individual actors may be embedded in hierarchical structures and other networks, they bring to bear resources embedded in the positions of these hierarchies as well. These resources lie beyond the focus resource that might have been the initial reason for interacting. For example, individual actors may interact because of their shared interest in gun control or abortion issues, but they also bring to the interacting context their other personal and positional resources, such as their jobs and authority positions, wealth, and affiliations with religious institutions and political parties, as well as the networks and resources of their spouses, relatives, friends, and fellow workers.

Thus, interactions should be analyzed and understood not only as relationship patterns among individual actors or nodes but, much more importantly, as resource patterns linked in interaction patterns. The

critical question then is: What patterns of resource linkage might be expected through interacting and networking?

The theoretical foundation for understanding interaction can be found in Homans’s (1950) studies of small primary groups. He postulated in principle the reciprocal and positive relationships among three factors: interaction, sentiment, and activity. The more individuals interact, the more likely they are to share sentiments and the more they engage in collective activity. Likewise, the more individuals share sentiments, the more likely they are to interact and engage in activities. The critical hypothesis for us here is the positive relationship between sentiment and interaction. That is, the basis of interaction is sentiment – affection, respect, sympathy, and liking for each other (Homans 1950, pp. 37–40) and vice versa. In other words, interaction is based primarily on shared emotion.

An important extension of the sentiment-interaction hypothesis is the homophily hypothesis. Largely a theoretical induction from research on patterns of friendship (Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954) and associations (Laumann 1966), the principle of  homophily , also known as the  like-me  hypothesis , is that  social interactions tend to take place among individuals with similar lifestyles and socioeconomic characteristics. Research has shown that interactions tend to occur among individual actors occupying similar or adjacent and slightly different social positions.

If we assume that socioeconomic characteristics and lifestyles reflect resources embedded in individuals and their hierarchical positions and network locations, then the homophilous principle of interaction implies a positive relationship between individuals with similar resources and the amount of their interaction, since similarity of social positions/locations is presumably characterized by similarity of types and amounts of resources. From the resource perspective, this suggests that interactions tend to occur among actors at the same or adjacent social positions in the hierarchy.

Thus, the Homans sentiment-interaction hypothesis becomes a sentiment-interaction-resources hypothesis. That is, there are triangular reciprocal relationships among sentiment, resources, and interaction that thus link interactions not only to shared sentiment, but also to similarity in resources. (See Figure 3.1.) While the sentiment-interaction hypothesis and the homophily hypothesis do not insist on a particular cause-and-effect sequence among the three elements, an important consequence of these hypotheses is that individuals whose positions are situated closer to each other in social structures are more likely to interact.

We may further extend the homophily principle to occupants of similar positions in multiple resource structures (e.g., authority, status, or class) because, by the rules of congruence and transferability of resources, interaction may engage partners with different kinds of resources as long as the values of their resources are equivalent. For example, a banker and a senator may have different resources, but they are both high in their respective resource structures, and thus are more likely to engage in interaction than, say, the banker and a local manager of a fast-food shop.

互动与同质交往：网络运行与社会资本

社会网络代表着正式性较弱的社会结构，因为它在刘定位置（position）和规则以及对参加者分配权威中几乎不存正式性。在社会网络中，流动性是占据者、位置（position）、资源以及规则和程序的特征。通过劝服而不是权威或强制达成的相互同意，规定着行动者的参与和互动，限定着参加者的（节点）的边界和位置。一个特定的网络可以自然地形成，也可以由对一个特定的共同关注的焦点或关于一种资源（如环境保护，女性权利）利益的社会性建构而来的。但是，一个社会网络通常可以为了不同部分的多重利益而建构一在网络的不同部分有不同的利益连接点。络中的节点，直接和间接地提供了接近社会网络中的其他节点（行动者）的机会。嵌在这些节点中的资源变成了自我的社会资本。前面已经指出，社会资本不仅仅反映网络中那些节点的个人资源。既然个体行动者可以被嵌入到等级结构和其他网络中，他们也可以使用嵌入在这些等级位置中的资源。这些资源的存在已经超出了作为最初互动的原因所被关注的资源。例如，个体行动者可能因为在枪支控制或堕胎问题上的共同利益而进行互动，但是他们也将其他个人的与位置的资源带入互动情景之中，如他们的工作和权威地位、财富、宗教机构和政党的联系，以及他们的配偶、亲戚、朋友和同事的网络与资源。

因此，互动不仅应该作为个体行动者或节点中的关系类型来分析和理解，更重要的，应该作为与互动类型相联系的资源类型来分析和理解。那么关键的问题是：通过互动与网络运行，什么类型的资源联系是被期待的？

理解互动的理论基础可以在霍曼斯（Homans,1950) 的小型基础群体研究中找到。他在理论上假定三类因素一互动、情感和活动之间，存在着互惠关系与正相关关系。个体互动越多，它们越可能共享情感，越可能参加集体活动。同样地，个体共享情感越多，它们越可能互动和参加活动。对我们来说，重要的假设是：情感与互动之间的正关系。也即，互动的基础是情

感 一一 友爱、尊敬、同情和互相喜欢（Homans,1950, PP-37-40），反之亦然。换言之，互动主要建立在共享感情的基础上。

对情感一互动假设的一个重要扩护展是同质假设（homophily hypothesis）。主要来自对友谊（Lazarsfeld and Merton,1954) 和联系（Laumann,1966) 的关系类型研究的一个理论归纳同质原则，也就是有名的似我（ike-me）假设社会互动倾向于在有相似的生活方式和社会经济特征的个体之间发生。研究已经显示，互动倾向于在占有相似的或者邻近且稍微不同的社会位置的个体行动者之间发生。

如果我们假定，社会经济特征与生活方式反映了嵌入在个体以及他们的等级位置和网络位置中的资源，那么互动的同质原则意味着，拥有相似资源的个体与他们的互动数量之间存在着正相关关系，因为社会位置的相似性大概以资源类型和数量的相似性为特征。从资源视角，这表明互动倾向于在等级制中相同或相邻社会位置的行动者中发生。

这样，霍曼斯的情感一互动假设変成了情感一互动一资源假设。也即，在情感、资源与互动之间存在着三角互惠关系，它不仅把互动与共享的情感联系在一起，而且把互动与资源的相似性联系起来。（参见图 31) 虽然情感一互动假设和同质假设并不强调这三个要素之间的因果顺序，但是这些假设的一个重要推论是：那些在社会结构中处于彼此接近位置的个体更可能发生互动

我们可以将同质原则进一步扩展到多重资源结构（如权威、地位或阶级）中的相似位置的占据者中，因为根据资源的一致性与可转换性原则，只要资源的价值是等量的，互动可以吸引拥有不同种类资源的搭档参加。例如，银行家和参议员可能拥有不同的资源，但是他们都在各自的资源结构中居于很高的位置，因此他们比一个银行家与一个当地快餐店的经理更可能发生互动。

## Concluding Remarks

This chapter has outlined the structural foundation for social capital, conceived as  resources embedded in a social structure that are accessed  and/or mobilized in purposive actions . It has defined resources and conceptualizes how resources acquire value in a society. It has suggested how such valued resources are embedded in hierarchical and network structures that are differentiated in terms of their degree of formalization of positions, authority, rules, and agents. Differential opportunity structures emerge because embedded resources in these social structures are differentially accessed by individual actors in their web of social relations and because the principle of homophily is the normative expectation. In this formulation, social capital is shown to have significant structural character – the embedded resources in hierarchies and networks, their capture at least in part contingent on the opportunity structure afforded by the normative principle of interactions, or homophily. In the next chapter, this structural foundation of social capital will be elaborated and complemented with the incorporation of possible action and choice elements in completing the conceptualization of social capital.

这一章概述了社会资本的结构基础，社会资本被视为：在目的性行动中获取和 / 或动员的、嵌入在社会结构中的资源。本章界定了资源，解释了资源在社会中如何获得价值，这些有价值资源如何嵌到等级制结构和网络结构中 —— 这些结构要根据位置、权威、规则和代理人正式化的程度来区分。有差异的机会结构出现，因为社会关系网中的个体行动者获取这些社会结构中的嵌入性资源的机会是不同的，而且同质原则是规范所期待的。社会资本显示出重要的结构特征 一一 嵌入在等级制和网络中的资源，至少其部分获得是由规范的互动原则或者说同质原则所提供的机会结构而定。在下一章，社会资本的这个结构基础将会被完善和补充进可能行动与选择因素，以使其概念完整。
