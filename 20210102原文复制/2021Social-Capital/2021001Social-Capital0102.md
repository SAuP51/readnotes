# 0102. Social Capital: Capital Captured through Social Relations  

The premise behind the notion of social capital is rather simple and straightforward:   investment in social relations with expected returns in   the marketplace . This general definition is consistent with various renditions by all scholars who have contributed to the discussion (Bourdieu 1980, 1983/1986; Lin 1982, 1995a; Coleman 1988, 1990; Flap 1991, 1994; Burt 1992; Putnam 1993, 1995a; Erickson 1995, 1996; Portes 1998). The market chosen for analysis may be economic, political, labor, or community. Individuals engage in interactions and networking in order to produce profits. This represents a major extension of the capital theory in general and a significant expansion of the neo-capital theory. Both neo-capital theories discussed so far – human capital and cultural capital – see capital as an investment of personal resources for the production of profit; while they differ in terms of the nature of production (skills and knowledge versus values and norms) and profit (economic return for individuals versus reproduction of the dominant culture), they both address capital as resources invested and vested in individual actors. Capital is seen as the investment or production of individual actors, whether seen as independent, atomized elements randomly located in society, as in the case of human capital theory, or as individuals indoctrinated into adopting the dominant values, as in the case of cultural capital.

But this individual perspective has been expanded with a major advance in neo-capital theory, the notion of social capital – capital captured through social relations. In this approach, capital is seen as a social asset by virtue of actors’ connections and access to resources in the network or group of which they are members.

社会资本概念背后的前提是相当简单明了的：期望在市场中得到回报的社会关系投资。这个一般的定义与所有对这个讨论有贡献的学者的各种解释是一致的（Bourdieu,1980,1983/1986;Lin,1982,1995: oleman,1988,1990; F-p,1991,1994: Bur,192 Putnam,1993,199a Erickson,19199ors,19）。作为分析对象的市场可以是经济的、政治的、劳动的或社区的。个体参与互动和网络运作是为了创造利润。这代表了一般的资本理论和新资本理论的重要延伸与扩展。迄今为止所讨论的新资本理论 —— 人力资本和文化资本 —— 都将资本看作能够产生利润的个人资源投资，尽管它们分析的生产（技能和知识对价值和规范）和利润（个人经济回报对主流文化的再生产）的性质是不同的，但是它们都将资本视为个体行动者的资源投资与所有。无论是像人力资本理论那样，将资本视为随机分布在社会中的独立的原子化的要素，还是像文化资本那样，将资本视为灌输到个体中的已被接受的主流价值，资本都被看作个体行动者的投资或生产。

社会资本概念扩展了这种个体化的视角，社会资本理论是新资本理论中一个主要发展。社会资本是通过社会关系获得的资本。在这个理论中，资本是一种社会财产，它借助于行动者所在网络或所在群体中的联系和资源而起作用。

## 2.1 Why Does Social Capital Work?

Generally, four explanations can be offered as to why embedded resources in social networks enhance the outcomes of actions. For one, 19

the flow of   information   is facilitated  .   In the usual imperfect market situations, social ties located in certain strategic locations and/or hierarchical positions (and thus better informed on market needs and demands) can provide an individual with useful information about opportunities and choices otherwise not available. Likewise, these ties (or their ties) may alert an organization (be it in the production or consumption market) and its agents, or even a community, about the availability and interest of an otherwise unrecognized individual. Such information would reduce the transaction cost for the organization to recruit better (be it in skill, or technical or cultural knowledge) individuals, and for individuals to find better organizations that can use their capital and provide appropriate rewards. Second, these social ties may exert   influence   on the agents (e.g., recruiters or supervisors of the organizations) who play a critical role in decisions (e.g., hiring or promotion) involving the actor. Some social ties, due to their strategic locations (e.g., structural holes) and positions (e.g., authority or supervisory capacities), also carry more valued resources and exercise greater power (e.g., greater asymmetry in dependence by these agents) on organizational agents’

decision making. Thus,「putting in a word」carries a certain weight in the decision-making process regarding an individual. Third, social ties, and their acknowledged relationships to the individual, may be conceived by the organization or its agents as certifications of the individual’s  social credentials , some of which reflect the individual’s accessibility to resources through social networks and relations – his or her social capital.「Standing behind」the individual by these ties reassures the organization (and its agents) that the individual can provide added resources beyond the individual’s personal capital, some of which may be useful to the organization. Finally, social relations are expected to reinforce identity and recognition. Being assured of and recognized for one’s worthiness as an individual and a member of a social group sharing similar interests and resources not only provides emotional support but also public acknowledgment of one’s claim to certain resources. These   reinforcements   are essential for the maintenance of mental health and the entitlement to resources. These four elements –   information, influence,   social credentials,   and    reinforcement  – may explain why social capital works in instrumental and expressive actions not accounted for by forms of personal capital such as economic or human capital.1

1 Another element, control, has also been mentioned for the usefulness of social capital.

I consider control, reflecting both the network’s location and the hierarchical position, as central to the definition of social capital itself. Thus, information, influence, social credentials, and reinforcement are all reasons why social capital works or controls.

社会资本为什么能运作？

为什么嵌入在社会网中的资源増强了行动的效果？一般有四种解释：

1、它促进了信息的流动。在通常的不完备市场情况下，处于某种战略位置（location）和 / 或等级位置（hierarchical position）`*`（这样可以更好地获悉市场需求情况）中的社会关系，能够为个人提供以其他方式不易获得的关于机会和选择的有用信息。同样地，这些关系（或者它们之间的关系）可以使组织（不管是在生产市场还是消费市场）及其代理人，甚至一个社区，注意到一个未被发掘的个人的可用性和兴趣。这种信息可以降低交易成本，使组织招聘到较好的（不管在技能、技术还是文化知识上）个人，使个人找到可以使用其资本和提供合适报酬的较好的组织。

2、这些社会关系可以对代理人（如组织的招聘者或管理者）—— 他们在涉及到行动者的决定（如雇佣或晋升）中扮演着关键角色 —— 施加影响。一些社会关系，由于它们处于战略性位置（locations）（如结构洞）和地位（positions）（如权威或管理地位）上，拥有更多的有价值资源并可以对组织代理人的决策施加更大的影响。因此，有时「说句话」在组织决定是否吸收一个人的过程中具有特定的分量。

3、社会关系可以被组织或代理人确定为个人的社会信用（social credentials）的证明，部分社会信用反映了个人通过社会络与社会关系 —— 他或她的社会资本，获取资源的能力。一些人的「后台」使组织（和它的代理人）相信这些人能够提供超越个人自身资本之外的额外资源，其中部分或许对组织有用。

4、最后，社会关系可以强化身份和认同感。确信和认识到自己是一个有价值的个体，是一个共享相似的利益和资源的社会群体的成员，不仅为个人提供了情感支持，而且为个人对某些资源权利的要求提供了公共承认。这些强化（reinforcement）对维持精神健康和资源的使用资格都是基本的。

这四类要素信息、影响、社会信用和强化可以解释为什么社会资本在工具性和表达性行动中发挥作用，而各种形式的个人资本，如经济资本或人力资本却不能说明。[1]

`*` 读者应该特别注意，position 和 location 都是本书的核心概念，它们都有位置的意思，但是 position 指结构中的位置，这个位置一般是制度设置的，有等级性和地位的涵义；而  location 指网络关系中的位置、是个体行动者通过自己的行动营造的反映了行动者的自主性。读者可在后续章节中自己体会出二者的差别。本来译者准备将 position 译为地位，而 location 译为位置，以区分二者；但反复权衡，窃以为 position 译为位置更妥当；另外，又找不出更好的可区分二者的好译法，因此除了将 strength-of-position proposition 译为地位强度命题，以与位置强度命题相区分，将 positional effect 译为地位效应，以与位置效应相区分，在其他地方，将二者均译为位置。读者只要记住，与结构性质有关的位置指 position；与网络的性质有关的位置指 location，这样便可分清楚。除了在论述位置-地位交命题等必要的地方，译者在翻译后面注明原词以澄清混乱之外，文中不特别注明英文，请读者自己细心分便是。—— 中译注

1 另一个要素 一一 控制，对社会资本的功用也被提到。我认为，控制既反映了网络地位又反映了等级地位，处于社会资本本身定义的中心地位。因而，信息、影响、社会信用和强化都是社会资本起作用或者控制的原因。

## 2.2 Differing Perspectives and Converging Conceptualizations

Social capital has been a relatively recent development in theory and research. While earlier scholars (Loury 1977, 1987; Ben-Porath 1980) pointed to the phenomenon of resources or capital through social relations or even employed the term   social capital , only in the 1980s, when several sociologists, including Bourdieu, Coleman, and Lin, independently explored the concept in some detail, did it catch the attention of the research community.

Two perspectives can be identified relative to the level at which return or profit is conceived – whether the profit is accrued for the group or for the individual. In one perspective, the focus is on the use of social capital by individuals – how individuals access and use resources embedded in social networks to gain returns in instrumental actions (e.g., finding better jobs) or to preserve gains in expressive actions. Thus, at this relational level, social capital can be seen as similar to human capital in that it is assumed that such investments can be made by the individual with an expected return (some benefit or profit) to the individual. Aggregation of individual returns also benefits the collective. Nonetheless, the focal points for analysis in this perspective are (1) how individuals invest in social relations and (2) how individuals capture the embedded resources in the relations to generate a return.

Lin (1982), for example, argued that there are two types of resources an individual can gain access to and use: personal resources and social resources. Personal resources are resources possessed by an individual and may include ownership of material as well as symbolic goods (e.g., diplomas and degrees). Social resources are resources accessed through an individual’s social connections. Depending on the extensity and diversity of their social connections, individuals have differential social resources.

Further, these resources can be「borrowed」for the purpose of making a gain. A car borrowed from a friend to move household goods and a good word put in by an old classmate of one’s father for a job possibility are examples of the use of social resources. As will be made clear later in this volume, in both quantity and quality, social resources far outweigh personal resources in their potential usefulness to individuals.

For Flap (1988, 1991, 1994), social capital also includes mobilized social resources. Flap specifies three elements of social capital: (1) the number of persons within one’s social network who「are prepared or obliged to help you when called upon to do so,」(2) the strength of the relationship indicating readiness to help, and (3) the resources of these persons. Social capital, for Flap, is resources provided by alters who have strong relationships with ego. Thus, it is the product of availability of social resources and the propensity by alters to offer such resources for help.

Burt’s work (1992) also reflects this perspective. Network locations represent and create competitive advantages. Locations that link nodes and their occupants to information and other resources unlikely to be accessible otherwise constitute valuable capital for the occupants at these

「structural hole」positions, and at other locations and for other occupants accessing them.

Another perspective focuses on social capital at the group level, with discussions dwelling on (1) how certain groups develop and more or less maintain social capital as a collective asset and (2) how such a collective asset enhances group members’ life chances. Bourdieu (1980, 1983/1986) and Coleman (1988, 1990) have discussed this perspective extensively, and Putnam’s empirical work (1993, 1995a) is exemplary.

While acknowledging the essentiality of individuals interacting and networking in developing payoffs of social capital, the central interest of this perspective is to explore the elements and processes in the production and maintenance of the collective asset.

Bourdieu (1983/1986) sees capital in three guises: as economic capital, as cultural capital, and as social capital. For him, social capital is「made up of social obligations or connections.」It is the aggregation of「actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition – or in other words, to membership in a group」(p. 248).

The group provides its members with the collectivity-owned capital, which allows them credit. Capital, in this form, is represented by the size of the network and the volume of the capital (economic, cultural, or symbolic) possessed by those to whom a person is connected. In other words, for Bourdieu, social capital depends on the size of one’s connections and on the volume or amount of capital in these connections’ possession.

Nevertheless, social capital is a collective asset shared by members of a defined group, with clear boundaries, obligations of exchange, and mutual recognition.

Further, Bourdieu sees social capital as a production of the group’s members. It takes repeated exchanges that reinforce mutual recognition and boundaries to affirm and reaffirm the collectivity of the capital and each member’s claim to that capital. Finally, for Bourdieu, social capital is a mere disguise for economic capital. In the final analysis,「economic capital is at the root of all the other types of capital,」including social capital and「every type of capital is reducible in the last analysis to economic capital」(pp. 252–253). In summary, then, Bourdieu sees social capital as a form of capital possessed by members of a social network or group. Through connections among the members, the capital can be used by members as credits. In this sense, social capital is a collective asset endowing members with credits, and it is maintained and reinforced for its utility when members continue to invest in the relationships.

For Coleman, social capital consists of two elements: it is an aspect of a social structure, and it facilitates certain actions of individuals within the structure (1990, p. 302). Whether any structural aspect is a capital depends on whether it serves a function for certain individuals engaged in particular activities. For this reason, social capital is not fungible across individuals or activities. Social capital is the resources, real or potential, gained from relationships. In his scheme of social action, Coleman (1990) delineates how actors exercise control over resources in which they have an interest, and how they are also interested in events (or the outcome of events) that are at least partially controlled by other actors. Thus, in order for their interests to gain from the outcome of an event, actors engage in exchanges and transfers of resources. These social relationships serve important functions in facilitating the actions of individual actors; they form the basis of social capital.

Coleman (1990) illustrates this point by using the examples of how clandestine groups among South Korean students (p. 302) or workers’

cells in the prerevolutionary communist movement in Russia (p. 304) not only provided social capital for individual participants, but also constituted social capital for the revolutionary movements themselves.

Parent–teacher associations (PTAs) and other social organizations allow individual parents and students to achieve personal goals, but they also offer resources to the school and to all administrators, teachers, students, and parents affiliated with the school. Coleman uses the example of a mother who moved from Detroit to Jerusalem because her children would be safer when going to the park and school by themselves as another illustration of how individual actors adapt to the social capital available in a collecitivity – the community. Thus, for Coleman and Bourdieu, dense or closed networks are seen as the means by which collective capital can be maintained and reproduction of the group can be achieved.

Putnam’s work on participation in voluntary organizations in democratic societies such as the United States strongly reflects the use of this perspective. He argues that such social associations and the degree of participation indicate the extent of social capital in a society. These associations and participation promote and enhance collective norms and trust, which are central to the production and maintenance of the collective well-being (Putnam 1993, 1995a).

While the two perspectives describe social capital differentially in terms of the level at which the utility or outcome can be assessed, all scholars remain committed to the view that it is the interacting members who make the maintenance and reproduction of this social asset possible. This consensual view puts social capital firmly in the neo-capital theory camp.2 Thus, Bourdieu, Coleman, Lin, Flap, Burt, Erickson, Portes, and others all share the understanding that social capital consists of resources embedded in social relations and social structure, which can be mobilized when an actor wishes to increase the likelihood of success in a purposive action. Like human capital, it is an investment on the part of the actor to increase the likelihood of success in purposive actions.

Unlike human capital, which represents investment in training and other programs of activities to acquire skills, knowledge, and certifications, social capital is an investment in social relationships through which resources of other actors can be accessed and borrowed. While the concept has been applied to a wide range of actions (e.g., moving to a different community that is safer for one’s children, mobilizing participants in a social movement; see Coleman 1990), and to both macro-

(e.g., number of participants and scope of participation in voluntary and community organizations and social groupings; see Putnam 1993, 1995a) and microlevels (e.g., job searches and promotions; see Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981; Burt 1997) of research, there is a converging consensus (Portes, Burt, Lin) that social capital, as a theory-generating concept, should be conceived in the social network context: as resources accessible through social ties that occupy strategic network locations (Burt) and/or significant organizational positions (Lin). This is the conceptualization I will use in this volume.

In this conceptualization, social capital may be defined operationally 2 Two major and different theoretical positions distinguish scholars in the collective asset camp. For Bourdieu, social capital represents a process by which individuals in the dominant class, by mutual recognition and acknowledgment, reinforce and reproduce a privileged group that holds various forms of capital (economic, cultural, and symbolic).

Nobility and titles characterize such groups and their members. Thus, social capital is another way of maintaining and reproducing the dominant class. I would characterize this theoretical position as one that views social capital as class (privilege) goods. The other position on social capital as a collective asset is represented by the works of Coleman and Putnam. Coleman, while defining social capital as consisting of any social-structural features or resources that are useful to individuals for specific actions, stresses social capital as a public good. These collective assets and features are available to all members of the group, be it a social group or a community, and regardless of which members actually promote, sustain, or contribute to such resources. Because social capital is a public good, it depends on the good will of the individual members to make such efforts and not to be free riders. Thus, norms, trust, sanctions, authority, and other structural features become important in sustaining social capital. If one were forced to trace the theoretical lineage of these two explanatory schemes, one could argue that the privileged-good view is principally an extension and elaboration of the social relations in Marx’s capital theory and that the public-good view is primarily an extension and elaboration of the integrative or Durkheimian view of social relations.

as the   resources embedded in social networks accessed and used by actors   for actions . Thus, the concept has two important components: (1) it represents resources embedded in social relations rather than individuals, and (2) access and use of such resources reside with actors. The first characterization, socially embedded resources, allows a parallel analysis between social capital and other forms of capital. For example, human capital, as envisioned by economists (Schultz, Becker) represents investment on the part of individuals to acquire certain skills and certifications that are useful in certain markets (e.g., the labor market). Social capital can also be envisioned as investment by individuals in interpersonal relationships useful in the markets. The second component of social capital, therefore, must reflect that ego is cognitively aware of the presence of such resources in her or his relations and networks and makes a choice in evoking the particular resources. There may be ties and relationships that do not appear in ego’s cognitive map and thus not in her or his awareness of their existence. Only when the individual is aware of their presence, and of what resources they possess or can access (these ties have their networks as well), can the individual capitalize such ties and resources. A systematic presentation of this conceptualization will begin in the next chapter.

不同的视角和趋同的概念

在理论和研究中，社会资本是一个相对晚近的概念。尽管早期学者（Loury1977,1987; Ben- Porath1980）指出社会关系的资源或资本性质，甚至使用了社会资本一词，但是直到 20 世纪 80 年代，当布迪厄、科尔曼和林南几个社会学家独立而详细地探究这个概念时，它引起了学术界的关注。

对应于所考虑的回报或利润所处的层次 —— 利润是为群体还是为个人增长，存在两个视角。

第一个视角关注个人对社会资本的使用 —— 为了在工具性行动（如找好的工作）中获得回报或在表达性行动中保持所得，个人如何获取和使用嵌入在社会网络中的资源。在这个层次上，社会资本类似于人力资本，因为个人进行这些投资是为了其自身的回报（一些利益或利润）。个人回报的聚集也有益于集体。然而在这个视角中，分析的焦点是：1）个人如何在社会关系中投资；2）为了产生回报，个人如何获得嵌入在关系中的资源。

林南（Iin,1982）认为个人有两种类型的资源可以获取和使用：个人资源和社会资源。个人资源是个体所拥有的资源，可以包括物质和符号物品（如文凭和学位）的所有权。社会资源是个人通过社会联系所获取的资源。由于社会联系的延伸性和多样性，个人有不同的社会资源。

而且，为了获益，这些资源可以「借」。从朋友那里借一辆车搬家，为了获得一份工作而让老同学的父亲帮着「说句话」，都是使用社会资源的例子。本书后面将会澄清：对个人的替在功用而言，社会资源无论在量上还是质上都要超过个人资源。

对弗拉普（Fap,1988,1991,1994）而言，社会资本也包括被动员的社会资源。弗拉普说明了社会资本的三个要素：1）在个人的社会网中，「当要求帮忙时，准备或者有义务帮助你」的人的数量；2）这些人表示愿意帮忙的关系强度；3）这些人的资源。弗拉普认为，社会资本是与自我有强关系的他人提供的资源。因此，社会资本是可利用的社会资源的产物和他人提供这些资源帮助的倾向。

伯特（Burt）的著作也反映了这个视角。网络位置（location）代表并创造了竞争优势。将节点（nodes）和节点的占据者与信息和其他资源（否则这些信息和资源是不可能获取的）连接起来的位置（location），对处在这些「结构洞」（structural hole）位置的占据者，以及接近它们的其他位置（location）和其他占据者，都构成了有价值的资本。

另一个视角关注群体层次的社会资本，这些讨论集中在：1）某些群体如何发展并或多或少地维持作为集体财产的社会资本；2）集体财产如何提高群体成员的生活机会。布迪厄 (Bourdieu,1980,1983/1986）和科尔曼（Coleman,1988,1990）从这个视角进行了广泛的讨论，而普特南的著作（Putnam,1993,1995a）是经验研究的典范。这个视角虽然承认个体互动和网络运作在扩展社会资本的报偿中的重要性，但它的主要兴趣是探究集体财产的生产与维持的要素和过程。

布迪厄 (Bourdieu,1983/1986）认为资本伪装成三种形式：经济资本、文化资本和社会资本。社会资本「由社会义务或联系组成」，「它是实际的或潜在的资源的集合，这些资源是与对一个相互熟识和认可的、具有制度化关系的持久网络的拥有 —— 换言之，一个群体的成员身份 一一 联系在一起（p.248）群体为其成员提供集体共有的资本，成员可以将这些资本用于信贷。这种形式的资本可以表示为网络的规模和资本的容量（经济的、文化的或符号的），那些与他人有联系者拥有这些资本。换言之，布迪厄认为，社会资本取决于个人联系的规模和这些联系中所含有的资本的容量或数量。然而，社会资本是一个确定群体的成员所共享的集体财产，这个群体有清楚的边界、互相交换的义务和相互的认可。

布迪厄进而将社会资本视为群体成员的生产。社会资本要进行重复的交换，这强化了相互的认可和边界，以反复确认资本的总体以及每一个成员对那些资本的所有权。最后，布迪厄指出，社会资本只是经济资本的一种形式。在最基础的分析中，「经济资本是所有类型资本的根基」，包括社会资本；「每一种资本在最后的分析中都可化约为经济资本」（p252-253）。总之，布迪厄将社会资本视为一种由社会网络或群体的成员所拥有的资本形式。通过成员之间的联系，成员可以将资本作为信贷使用。在这个意义上社会资本是一种赋予成员信货的集体财产，当成员在关系中继续投资时，它的功用也得到维持和强化。

科尔曼认为社会资本包括两个要素：1）它是社会结构的一个方面；2）在结构内它便利了个体的某些行动（Coleman,1990, p302）。结构的任何一个方面是否是资本，取决于它是否对参与某种活动的某些个体发挥功能。出于这个原因，社会资本是个人或活动所无法代替的。社会资本是从关系中获得的、现实的或潜在的资源。在科尔曼的社会行动的图式中，他刻画了行动者如何对他们感兴趣的资源进行控制，以及他们如何对至少部分地被其他行动者控制的事件（或事件的结果）感兴趣。行动者为了从一个事件的结果中获得利益，他们参与资源的交换和转移。这些社会关系在便利个体行动者的行动中发挥重要的功能，它们形成了社会资本的基础。

科尔曼（Coleman,1990）举例说明了这一点。韩国学生中的秘密群体（P-302）或俄国革命前共产主义运动中的工人组织，不仅为个人参与提供了社会资本，而且它们本身组成了革命运动的社会资本。父母-教师协会（PTAs）和其他社会组织允许父母和学生实现他们的个人目标，但是它们也向学校和所有与学校有联系的行政管理者、教师、学生和父母提供资源。科尔曼又举了个体行动者如何适应集体（社区）中可利用的社会资本的例子。一位母亲为了让她的孩子步行到公园或学校的过程更安全，从底特律迁到了耶路撒冷。因此，对科尔曼和布迪厄而言，紧密或者封闭的网络是维持集体资本和实现群体再生产的手段。

1『网络在社会资本里占据着核心地位。（2021-01-02）』

普特南的著作对民主社会（如美国）中参与自愿组织的研究，就反映了这样的视角。他认为，这些社会性社团和参与程度反映了一个社会中的社会资本范围，它们也促进和增强了集体的规范与信任，这对集体福利的生产和维持是至关重要的（Putnam,1993,1995a）。

虽然两个视角所描述的社会资本在功用或结果评估的层次上有差异，但是所有的学者都坚持认为，互动中的成员维持和再生产了这种可能的社会财产。这种共识牢牢地将社会资本置于新资本理论的阵营 [2]。这样，布迪厄、科尔曼、林南、弗拉普、伯特、埃里克森（Erickson）、波茨（Portes）和其他学者都认为，社会资本由嵌入在社会关系和社会结构中的资源组成，当行动者希望提高目的性行动成功的可能性时，他们可以动员社会资本。与人力资本一样，社会资本是行动者提高目的性行动成功的可能性的投资。不像人力资本 —— 代表着在培训和其他获得技能、知识和证书的活动计划中的投资，社会资本是在社会关系中的投资，通过社会关系可以使用和借取其他行动者的资源。这个概念被运用到大范围的行动中（如为了孩子更安全而迁到个不同的社区，在一个社会运动中动员参与者；参见 Coleman, 1990），以及宏观层次（如在志愿组织、社区组织和社会群集中，参与者的数量和自愿参加的范围；参见 Putnam,1993,1995a）和微观层次（如求职和晋升；参见 Lin, Ensl, and Vaughn,1981; Bur,1997）的研究中。同时逐渐产生了一个共识，社会资本作为一个在理论中产生的概念，应该在社会网络背景中考虑：作为通过占据战略网络位置 (location）和 / 或重要组织位置（position）的社会关系而获取的资源。在本书中我将使用这个概念。

2『社会资本与文化资本区别，做一张任意卡片。』——已完成

在这个概念中，社会资本可以操作化地定义为，行动者在行动中获取和使用的嵌入在社会网络中的资源。这个概念有两个重要的组成部分：1）它代表着嵌入在社会关系中而不是个人中的资源；2）这些资源的获取和使用取决于行动者。第一个特征 —— 社会的嵌入性资源，容许在社会资本和其他资本形式之间进行相对应的分析。例如，人力资本被经济学家（Schultz,  Becker）视为代表着个人为获得在某种市场中（如劳动力市场）有用的某种技能和证书的投资。社会资本也可以被视为个人在市场中对有用的人际关系的投资。社会资本的第二个组成部分必须反映出，自我在认知上意识到这些资源在她或他的关系和网络中是存在的，并且决定唤起这些特殊的资源。可能有些关系不出现在自我的认知地图之中，它们的存在不在她或他的意识之中。只有当个人意识到它们的存在，意识到他们拥有或能够获取的资源（这些关系也有它们的网络），他们才能将这些关系和资源资本化。下一章将对社会资本概念进行系统的闻述。

2 两种不同的理论立场将集体财产阵营的学者区分开来。对布迪厄而言，社会资本代表了统治阶级中的个体通过相互认可和承认来强化和再生产拥有不同资本（经济的、文化的和符号的）形式的特权群体的过程。这些群体及其成员以贵族和头衔为特征。这样，社会资本是维持和再生产统治阶级的另一种方式。这个理论立场将社会资本视为阶级（特权）物品。将社会资本作为集体财产的另一个理论立场，以科尔曼和普特南的著作为代表。科尔曼虽然将社会资本定义为，对个人的具体行动有用的任何社会结构特征或资源，但是他强调社会资本是公共物品。不管在社会群体还是社区中，也不管是哪些成员在实际地增进、维持或贡献这些资源，这些集体财产和特征对群体的所有成员都是可以利用的。因为社会资本是公共物品，它依赖于个体成员付出努力而不搭便车的好的意愿。这样，规范、信任、准许、权威和其他结构特征在维持社会资本中变得非常重要。如果一定要追溯这两个解释图式的理论渊源，那么可以认为：特权-物品的观点主要是对马克思资本理论中社会关系的扩展和具体闻述；而公共-物品观点则主要是对社会关系的整体的或涂尔干式的观点的扩展和具体述。

## 2.3 Issues and Clarifications

Before I embark on the conceptual presentation, certain issues need to be discussed and clarified. Specifically, the divergence in perspectives has created some theoretical and measurement confusions. Further confusion arises from the fact that some discussions have flowed freely between levels. For example, Bourdieu provides a structural view in pointing to the dominant class and nobility groups’ reproduction as the principal explanation of social capital, which is represented by aggregating (1) the size of the group or network and (2) the volume of capital possessed by members (Bourdieu 1983/1986, p. 248). This representation makes sense only when it is assumed that all members maintain strong and reciprocal relations (a completely dense or institutionalized network), so that the strength of relations does not enter into the calculus. Yet, Bourdieu also describes how individuals interact and reinforce mutual recognition and acknowledgment as members of a network or group. Coleman (1990, Chap. 12), while emphasizing how individuals can use sociostruc-tural resources in obtaining better outcomes in their (individual) actions, devotes much discussion to the collective nature of social capital in stress-ing trust, norms, sanctions, authority, and closure as parts or forms of the concept. It is important to identify and sort through these views and

One major controversy generated from macro- versus relational-level perspectives is whether social capital is collective goods or individual goods (see Portes’s 1998 critique). Most scholars agree that it is both collective and individual goods; that is, institutionalized social relations with embedded resources are expected to benefit both the collective and the individuals in the collective. At the group level, social capital represents some aggregation of valued resources (e.g., economic, political, cultural, or social, as in social connections) of members interacting as a network or networks. The difficulty arises when social capital is discussed as collective or even public goods, along with trust, norms, and other collective or public goods. What has occurred in the literature is that some terms have become alternative or substitutable terms or measurements. Divorced from its roots in individual interactions and networking, social capital becomes merely another trendy term to employ or deploy in the broad context of improving or building social integration and solidarity. In the following, I will argue that social capital, as a relational asset, must be distinguished from collective assets and goods such as culture, norms, trust, and so on. Causal propositions may be formulated (e.g., that collective assets, such as trust, promote relations and networks and enhance the utility of embedded resources, or vice versa; see Chapter 13), but it should not be assumed that they are all alternative forms of social capital or are defined by one another (e.g., trust is capital; Paxton 1999).

Another controversy related to the focus on social capital’s collective aspect is the assumed or expected requirement that there is closure or density in social relations and social networks (Bourdieu 1983/1986; Coleman 1990; Putnam 1993, 1995a). Bourdieu, from his class perspective, sees social capital as the investment of the members in the dominant class (as a group or network) engaging in mutual recognition and acknowledgment so as to maintain and reproduce group solidarity and preserve the group’s dominant position. Membership in the group is based on a clear demarcation (e.g., nobility, title, family) excluding out-siders. Closure of the group and density within the group are required.

Coleman, of course, does not assume such a class vision of society. Yet, he also sees network closure as a distinctive advantage of social capital, because it is closure that maintains and enhances trust, norms, authority, sanctions, and so on. These solidifying forces may ensure that network resources can be mobilized.

I believe that the requirement for network density or closure for the utility of social capital is not necessary or realistic. Research in social networks has stressed the importance of bridges in networks (Granovetter 1973; Burt 1992) in facilitating information and influence flows.

To argue that closure or density is a requirement for social capital is to deny the significance of bridges, structural holes, or weaker ties. The root of preferring a dense or closed network lies rather in certain outcomes of interest (Lin 1986, 1990, 1992a). For   preserving or maintaining   resources  (i.e., expressive actions), denser networks may have a relative advantage. Thus, for the privileged class, it would be better to have a closed network so that resources can be preserved and reproduced (e.g., Bourdieu 1983/1986) or for a mother to move to a cohesive community so that her children’s security and safety can be assured (Coleman 1990).

On the other hand, for   searching for and obtaining resources   not presently possessed (i.e., instrumental actions), such as looking for a job or a better job (e.g., Lin, Marsden, Flap, Burt), accessing and extending bridges in the network should be more useful. Rather than making the assertion that closed or open networks are required, it would be theoretically more viable to (1) conceptualize for what outcomes and under what conditions a denser or sparser network might generate a better return and (2) postulate deduced hypotheses (e.g., a denser network would be more likely to promote the sharing of resources, which in turn would maintain group or individual resources; or an open network would be more likely to access advantaged positions and resources, which in turn would enhance the opportunity to obtain additional resources) for empirical examination.

A third controversy that requires clarification is Coleman’s statement that social capital is any「social-structural resource」that generates returns for an individual in a specific action. He remarks that「social capital is defined by its function」and that「it is not a single entity, but a variety of different entities having two characteristics: They all consist of some aspect of a social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals who are within the structure」(1990, p. 302). This   functional  view may implicate a tautology: social capital is identified when and if it works; the potential causal explanation of social capital can be captured only by its effect; or whether it is an investment depends on the return for a specific individual in a specific action. Thus, the causal factor is defined by the effectual factor. Clearly, it would be impossible to build a theory in which causal and effectual factors are folded into a singular function. This is not to deny that a functional relationship may be hypothesized (e.g., resources embedded in social networks make it easier to obtain better jobs). But the two concepts must be treated as separate entities with independent measurements (e.g., social capital is the investment in social relations, and better jobs are represented by occupational status or supervisory position). It would be incorrect to allow the outcome variables to dictate the specification of the causal variable (e.g., for actor X, kin ties are social capital because they channel X to get a better job, and for actor Y, kin ties are not social capital because they do not channel Y to get a better job). The hypothesized causal relationship may be conditioned by other factors (e.g., family characteristics may affect differential opportunities for building human and social capital) that need be specified in a more elaborate theory. A theory would lose parsimony quickly if the conditional factors become part of the definitions of the primary concepts. In fact, one would question whether it remains a theory if it is required to make a good prediction for every case and every situation.

Perhaps related to this indistinguishable view of social capital from its outcome – and perhaps given his view that social capital, as a collective good, can also be seen in many different forms, such as trust, norms, sanctions, authority, and so on – Coleman questions「whether social capital will come to be as useful a quantitative concept in social science as are the concepts of financial capital, physical capital, and human capital remains to be seen; its current value lies primarily in its usefulness for qualitative analyses of social systems and for those quantitative analyses that employ qualitative indicators」(1990, pp. 304–305). Again, the confusion can be seen as resulting from extending the notion of social capital beyond its theoretical roots in social relations and social networks, and the unattainable theoretical position that prediction holds for every individual case. Once these issues are resolved, social capital should and must be measurable.

问题及其澄清

在我开始陈述社会资本概念之前，一些问题需要讨论与澄清。很明确，视角的分歧已经产生了一些理论和测量的混乱。更多的混乱是由一些讨论在各层次之间自由地摆动而引起的。例如，布迪厄提供了一个结构的视角，他将统治阶级和贵族群体的再生产作为社会资本的主要解释，社会资本可以表示为两类要素的集合：1）群体或网络的规模；2）成员所拥有的资本容量  (Bourdieu, 1983/19806, P248）。只有当所有成员维持强关系和互惠关系（一个完全紧密或制度化的网络），因此关系强度不进入计算时，这个表述才有意义。

然而，布迪厄也描述了个体作为网络或群体的成员，如何互动与强化相互的认可和承认。科尔曼（Coleman,1990, Chap12）在强调个体在行动中如何使用社会结构资源获得更好结果的同时，又致力于社会资本的集体性质的讨论，将信任、规范、准许、权威和封闭作为这个概念的组成部分或形式。在我们开始建构一个内在一致的社会资本理论之前，对这些观点的识别、分类和理解是非常重要的。我将这些问题梳理成表 2.1。

2.1 关于社会资本的争论

| 争论 | 主张 | 存在的问题 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 集体或个人的财产（科尔曼、普特南） | 社会资本是集体财产 | 与规范、信任相混淆 |
| 封闭或开放的网络（布迪厄、科尔曼、普特南） | 群体是封闭或紧密的 | 阶级社会的视野，缺乏流动性 |
| 功能的（科尔曼） | 社会资本表现为某种行动的效果 | 同义反复（原因由结果决定） |
| 测量（科尔曼） | 不能量化 | 启发式的，不能证伪的 |

产生于宏观层次对关系层次的一个主要争论是，社会资本是集体物品还是个人物品（参见 Portes [1998] 的评论）。大多数学者同意社会资本既是集体物品又是个人物品；也即，拥有嵌入性资源的制度化的社会关系对集体和集体中的个人都是有益的。在群体层次，社会资本代表着在网络中互动的成员的一些有价值资源（例如，作为社会联系中的经济的、政治的、文化的或社会的资源）的集合。当把社会资本作为集体物品、甚至公共物品，与信任、规范和其他集体或公共物品一起讨论时，困难就出现了。在文献中出现的情况是，一些术语已经变成了可选择或可替代的术语或测量。社会资本背离了个体互动和网络运作的根基，变成了在促进或建构社会整合和社会团结的广泛背景下所使用或展开的另一个时髦的术语。

下面我主张，社会资本作为一个关系的财产，必须与集体财产和物品，如文化、规范、信任等分开。因果命题可以闻述（例如，集体财产，如信任，促进了关系和网络，增强了嵌入性资源的功用，反之亦然；Chap13），但是不能认为，它们都是可替代的社会资本形式，或者可以彼此相互定义（例如，信任是资本；Paxton, 1999）。

另一个与社会资本的集体性有关的争论是：假定封闭性与紧密性是社会关系和社会网络的必要条件（Bourdieu, 1983/1986; Coleman, 1990; Putnam,1993, 1995a）。布迪厄从阶级视角出发，把社会资本视为统治阶级中（作为一个群体或网络）的成员的投资。他们为了维持和再生产群体团结，保持群体的统治地位，而进行相互认可和承认。群体中的成员身份建立在意图排除外来者的清楚划分（如高贵的出身、头衔、家庭）的基础之上。群体的封闭性与群体内的紧密性是必须得到满足的。当然，科尔曼没有采用这样一种阶级社会的视野。但是他也将网络封闭性视为社会资本的一个明显优势，因为封闭性维持和增强了信任、规范、权威、准许，等等。这些团结的力量可以确保网络资源能够被动员起来。

我认为，对社会资本的功用而言，对网络紧密性或封闭性的要求是不必要，也是不现实的。社会网络的研究强调网络中的桥梁（Granovetter, 1973; Burt, 1992）对促进信息流和影响流的重要性。将封闭性或紧密性作为社会资本的必要条件，就否认了桥梁、结构洞或弱关系的重要性。对紧密或封闭网络的偏爱是某种利益的结果（Lin, 1986, 1990, 1992a）。为了保持或维持资源（如表达性的行动），密网存在相对的优势。对特权阶级而言，封闭的网络对资源的保持和再生产更有利（如 Bourdieu, 1983/1986）；或者对一位母亲而言，为了确保孩子的安全，迁到一个内聚性的社区更有利（Coleman, 1990)。另一方面，为了寻找和获得当前没有的资源（例如工具性的行动），如找工作或换一份更好的工作（Iin, Marsden, Fap, Burt），获取和扩展网络中的桥梁会更有用。相对于断言封闭的或开放的网络是必须的，在理论上更可行的是：1）将在什么结果和在什么条件下，密网或松网可能产生更好的回报概念化。2）为经验考察设立可推论的假设（例如，密网更可能促进资源的共享；或者，开放的网络更可能获取优势位置（positon）和资源，反过来这又会提高获得额外资源的机会。

第三个要求澄清的争论是科尔曼的陈述：社会资本是为个体的某种行动产生回报的任何「社会结构资源」。他论述道，「社会资本根据它的功能来定义」；「它不是一个单一的实体，而是拥有两个特征的多种不同实体：它们都由社会结构的某一方面组成，它们便利了结构内个体的某种行动（Coleman, 1990, p302）。

这个功能的观点可能意味着同义反复：社会资本在起作用的时候被识别；社会资本的潜在原因解释只能通过它的结果来获得；或者说，它是否是一个投资取决于特定个体在特定行动中的回报。这样，原因因素由结果因素来界定。很显然，原因和结果因素被调入一个单一功能的理论是不可能建立起来的。这不是否认功能关系可以建立假设（例如，嵌入在社会网络中的资源使获得好的工作更容易）。但是两个概念必须处理为可以独立测量的分离的实体（例如，社会资本是在社会关系中的投资，好的工作可以由职业地位或管理地位来代表）。让结果变量来规定原因变量是不正确的（例如，对行动者 X，亲属关系是社会资本，因为它们为 X 获得一份好工作提供了渠道；对行动者 Y，亲属关系不是社会资本，因为它们没有为 Y 获得一份好工作提供渠道）。作为假设的因果关系可能受到其他因素的影响（例如，家庭特征可以影响建构人力资本和社会资本的不同机会），这需要在个更精致的理论中详细地说明。如果条件因素变成了主要概念的定义的部分，这个理论将会很繁琐。事实上，人们会怀疑，对每一种情况都可以很好地预测的理论是否存在。

可能因为科尔曼认定社会资本与它的结果难以区分，也可能因为他认定社会资本可作为一种集体物品，因而有很多不同的形式，如信任、规范、准许、权威，诸如此类使科尔曼提出疑问：「社会资本是否会像社会科学中的金融资本、物质资本和人力资本那样，成为一个有用的定量概念，有待于观察；它当前的价值主要在于它对社会体系作定性分析，以及储能作为定量分析中的定性指标」（Coleman, 1990, p304-305）。而且，这种困惑可能由于他对社会资本概念的扩展，超出了它在社会关系和社会网络中的理论根基而造成的。对每一种个人情况都进行预测是其难以实现的理论地位。一旦这些问题得以解决或澄清，社会资本应该而且一定是可以度量的。
