The Structural Foundation

It has been proposed that social capital, as an investment in social relations with an expected return in the marketplace, should be defined as  resources embedded in a social structure that are accessed and/or mobilized in purposive actions . In this definition, three critical components present themselves for analysis: (1) the resources, (2) being embedded in a social structure, and (3) action. I contend that resources are at the core of all capital theories, especially social capital. A theory of social capital should accomplish three tasks: First, it should explain how resources take on values and how the valued resources are distributed in society –

the structural embeddedness of resources. Second, it should show how individual actors, through interactions and social networks, become differentially accessible to such structurally embedded resources – the opportunity structure. Third, it should explain how access to such social resources can be mobilized for gains – the process of activation. This chapter will focus on the first two of these tasks: embeddedness of valued resources in society and the opportunity structure relative to such resources. Chapter 4 will conclude the explication of the theory by discussing the action component.

Resources and Their Social Allocation

A fundamental concept of the theory presented here is resources, defined  as material or symbolic goods  (Lin 1982).1 Beyond the basic physical resources needed to sustain and enhance human life, individuals and groups ascribe meanings and significance to other resources as well.

1 Sewell (1992, p. 9) identified two types of resources in structure: nonhuman and human resources. While nonhuman resources are consistent with physical resources, human resources include both physical (physical strength, dexterity) and symbolic (knowledge, emotional commitment) resources.

Theory and Research

Here, three principles are proposed as assumptions about how meanings and significance are assigned to resources.

First, in any human group or community,   differential values are   assigned by consensus or influence to resources   to signal their relative significance (Lin 1982). Value assignment of a resource is dictated in part by its scarcity relative to the demand or expectations for it (e.g., gold in one society or seashells in another). But it is also determined by the unique historical, geographical, and collective experiences of each group.

The assignment of values to resources may be achieved through one of three processes of influence: persuasion, petition, or coercion (Lin 1973; and see related discussions in Kelman 1961 and Parsons 1963).

Persuasion   is a process by which fellow actors are convinced, through communication and interaction, of the merit of a resource, resulting in the internalization of the value of a resource among the actors. Members supposedly see the intrinsic value of a resource. Persuasion results in assigning value to a resource without the threat or imposition of external sanction or punishment.   Petition   indicates the appeal or lobbying of a group of individual actors and represents normative pressure. Individual actors accept the value of a resource because they wish to remain members of a group or identify with the group, and they are willing to accept what the group’s values even if they do not understand or accept the resource’s intrinsic merit.   Coercion   is the process by which fellow actors are forced to recognize the merit of a resource or face certain sanction or punishment. Individual actors do not see the intrinsic value of a resource or voluntarily accept its value because they wish to identify with the group. Rather, they are confronted with either recognizing the authoritative assignment of value or suffering undesirable consequences (physical or mental harm, for example).

The assigned value of a resource may change due to internal (civil war, revolution, upheaval, disaster, authoritative revision, discoveries, changes in fashion or taste, etc.) and external (trade, war, invasion, con-quest, exchange of ideas, etc.) forces. For example, the status of females, while universally distinct, is expressed differently in different communities and epochs. For women in the Qing dynasty of imperial China, bound feet signaled high status; the smaller the foot, the more highly the lady was regarded. For women in mid-twentieth-century Europe and North America, high heels similarly signaled high status. Both resources are valuable in their respective contexts and time, perhaps for women to attract mates who have other valued resources. While the value of each resource is time-bound, some resources are more enduring or universal (e.g., money, ethnic or racial ranking, pierced body parts) than others (e.g., bound feet, kilts for men, and wigs for judges or high priests).

The Structural Foundation  31

Second, we assume that   all actors will take actions to promote their   self-interests by maintaining and gaining valued resources if such opportunities are available.   An   actor   here is either an individual or a collective group. The collectivity, or the community, promotes its self-interest by conferring relatively higher statuses on individual actors who possess more valued resources. There is a good reason why the collectivity would confer such status on or「empower」(Sewell 1992) individual actors. It reinforces the social consensus of the collectivity on the values of the resources – a sense of community. It is a reward to an individual actor for his or her demonstrated adherence to the social consensus on the assigned values. The status conferral serves to promote the unity, and thus the survival and persistence, of the collectivity. Conferred status further reinforces the loyalty to the collectivity of the individual actors in possession of the valued resource, because it confirms and protects the values of the resources. Thus, status conferral for possession of valued resources promotes the mutual interests of the community and the participating individual actors.

The reciprocal relationship between the persistence of a community and its conferral of status on individual actors possessing valuable resources has important consequences for collective action. Individual actors holding more valued resources, and therefore higher standings, tend to be given the opportunity to make decisions on behalf of or in the name of the collectivity, including ways to allocate and distribute the valued resources. Such an opportunity is offered by assigning to these individual actors decision-making positions in the collectivity. This structural opportunity will be discussed further in the next section on the macrostructure of resources. In any case, the consequence is that individual actors in possession of valued resources are more likely to be involved in decisions regarding the rights (use, transfer, disposition) of these resources (e.g., valued properties).2 Actors in decision-making positions are expected to reinforce the community consensus, because there is an incentive for them to sustain and promote their standing in the community. Self-interest is thus served because it is consistent with collective interest. These powerful individual actors can further advance their standing by either gaining more valued resources, or manipulating value consensus to promote the value of resources that they possess or can access. Higher positions in the collectivity offer more opportunities to promote self-interest.

On the other hand, individual actors with less valued resources and 2 For a discussion of property rights, see Alchian (1965), Alchian and Demsetz (1973), Gilham (1981), and Willer (1985). For the relationships between property rights and class structures, see Dahrendorf (1959), Bourdieu (1986), and Kornai (1992).

thus lower standings in the community experience greater structural constraints and less opportunities to innovate. There are two types of actions these individuals can take: either appropriate more valued resources or change the values assigned to various resources. Appropriation of valued resources can employ means legitimated and sanctioned by the community, that is, institutionalized channels such as going through the educational system. Or it can employ means not sanctioned or considered legitimate by the community, that is, deviant actions. Merton (1940), in his work on social structure and anomie, has theorized how individual actors can violate group norms to achieve individual goals.

To change the values of resources requires more than individual actions; it needs the mobilization of other actors who make similar demands. Such mobilization can range from the formation of social networks promoting alternative value assignments to resources to revolu-tions that aim to replace the community’s decision makers (for further discussion, see Chapter 11).

These deviant actions, of course, risk sanctions from the community.

Sanctions may range from demotion in community standing (incarcera-tion or deprivation of valued resources and higher status) to expulsion.

Such is the force of structure on individual actors to act responsibly. Yet, the fact remains that structural constraints and opportunities go hand in hand (Merton 1995). The focal point, for both individuals and the community, remains contention for valued resources, and actions are taken to promote self-interest by gaining and preserving such resources.

In ordinary times, when actions and interactions are carried out routinely, the significance of the constraint–opportunity synergy is not clear to the actors themselves, since the decisions seem to be made by the collectivity’s invisible hand for the well-being of every member. It becomes more explicit when the community’s survival is challenged. In time of external crisis, a unified community follows a strategy that protects those with the most valued resources and sacrifices those with the least valued resources. In facing an external threat, for example, a collectivity would tend to let go the non–decision makers first or in higher proportions, while the managers who authorize or control such layoffs tend to survive unless the collectivity is on the verge of collapse. During the waning phase of World War II, Japan sent its low-ranking and younger pilots on kamikaze missions while holding back the higher-ranked and more experienced pilots in preparation for the final battle to defend the motherland.

Preservation of the community and preservation of individual actors in possession of valued resources are mutually serving and sustaining.

The third principle regarding valued resources assumes that   maintaining and gaining valued resources are the two primary motives for   action, with the former outweighing the latter  (Lin 1994a). Both the

The Structural Foundation  33

community and its individual actors strive, first, to maintain the valued resources they possess or to which they can gain access. Only when the existing valued resources are secured do actors seek to gain additional valued resources. There are secondary and peripheral motives for actions; however, we assume that these two motives are primary and dictate the overwhelming proportion of actions. A further deliberation on the significance of this principle and its consequences for action will appear in Chapter 4.

The Macrostructure of Resources: Hierarchies and Social Positions

Once resources are defined and their values and significance assumed, we next consider how resources are embedded in the collectivity. The following description below focuses on several topics: (1) the nature of a social structure, (2) the hierarchy in a social structure, (3) the pyramidal shape of the hierarchical structure, and (4) complex social structures and resource transactions.

Social Structure

A   social structure   is here defined as consisting of (1) a set of social units (  positions ) that possess differential amounts of one or more types of valued resources and that (2) are hierarchically related relative to   authority  (control of and access to resources), (3) share certain   rules   and procedures in the use of the resources, and (4) are entrusted to   occupants  (  agents ) who   act on   these rules and procedures (for related discussion, see Sewell 1992).

The first element links the embeddedness of resources to social positions (for a discussion of the positional view of structure, see Burt 1992).

The occupant of a position may change, but the resources are attached to the position. Therefore, resources embedded in a structure are distinguished from resources possessed by individual actors. A structure remains stable as long as the positions with their embedded resources persist (Weber 1947).

The second element describes relations among the positions.   Authority   is one form of power, defined as the relative control over and access to the valued resources (see discussion of this definition in Emerson 1962; Cook and Emerson 1978; Bourdieu 1983/1986; Coleman 1990, pp.

780–782), identifying the relative ranking between any pair of positions.

Authority implies coercion, with explicit legalistic sanctions. A structure

34

Theory and Research

is more hierarchical the more the relative authority among its positions differs.

The third element describes the shared procedures and rules guiding how positions (and the agents) ought to act and interact relative to the use and manipulation of valued resources (for a discussion of rules in structure, see Sewell 1992).3 The rules and procedures lead to uniform actions and interactions among social positions, so that the value of the resources is upheld and maintaining and expanding such resources remain the purposes of collective actions.

The final element is the occupants of these positions, which highlights the fact that they are expected to behave in accordance with these rules and procedures. Thus, social structure, with its rules and procedures, represents the principle, and the individual actors who occupy positions and are empowered to act out the rules and procedures are the agents. This is a very important principle and a paradox as well. On the one hand, enactment of the rules and procedures is critical to the persistence of the structure, so that selection of occupants favors those who are socialized and trained to carry out these rules and procedures. On the other hand, because occupants must carry out these rules and procedures, individual actors in these positions gain opportunities to act according to their own interpretations. The paradox is that while these occupants are favored because of their skills and knowledge, and the expectation that they will carry out the rules and procedures that sustain the community, these agents are also given opportunities to act according to their whims –

a reliance on their ability and willingness to interpret「properly」and act effectively and creatively. This agency principle (for a discussion of agency and agents in structure, see Sewell 1992) runs the risk that occupants may consider interests other than those of the collectivity in their interpretations or err in applying the rules and procedures to actual situations.

These four elements –   positions, authority, rules,   and    agents  –

collectively define the social macrostructure as a system of coordination for the maintenance and/or acquisition of one or more types of valued resources for the collectivity.

Hierarchical Structure

In general, social structures and their resource(s) can be classified over a continuum of differential explicitness in resources, positions, authority, 3 Rules and procedures exist beyond the social structure described here. In a larger society, the shared, understood, and largely consensual「ways of thinking and doing things」or

「rules of the game」form culture or institutions (see Bourdieu 1972/1977; Meyer and Rowan 1977; North 1990; Scott and Meyers 1994; Lin 1994b). Also see Chapter 11.

The Structural Foundation  35

rules, and agents. The formalization of a social structure is characterized by the extent to which these elements are made explicit, and inclusive and exclusive criteria are well understood in terms of valued resources, positions, authority, rules and procedures, and occupants.4 It is impossible to identify the full range, and thus all types, of social structures in terms of their formality. In general, and stereotypically, the degree of formalization of social structures ranges from so-called formal organizations or hierarchical structures (e.g., firms, corporations, and agencies) to voluntary associations and clubs and to informal social networks.5

We will focus on the more formally organized and hierarchical social structures. Differentiation between formal organizations and less formal structures such as social networks will emerge as the discussion warrants.

In hierarchical structures, positions are linked in a chain of authoritative command, where higher and more powerful positions not only dictate the behaviors of occupants of less powerful positions by instructing and socializing them as to how to interpret rules and procedures, but also dispose of these lower positions, discharge occupants, and reallocate embedded resources, as dictated by explicit rules and procedures or interpretations of the former by occupants in higher positions. The rules and procedures, in principle, are legalized in that they are usually enforceable, with the approval of and even enforcement by the larger community (e.g., the state); punitive actions can be taken against violations or deviations. The occupants are designated in contract relationships and can be dismissed under rules (Weber 1946, 1947).

A simple formal structure is therefore defined as a hierarchical structure consisting of a set of positions linked in authority (legitimately coercive) relations (command chains) over the control and use of certain valued resources. The relative rank ordering of positions in terms of access to valued resources can be determined by their vertical location in the authority hierarchy. A position higher up in the hierarchy, by definition, can exercise authority over lower positions. Just as important, the higher positions have more information about the locations of valued resources in the hierarchy – where specific types and amounts of resources are embedded. In other words, the higher the position in the hierarchical structure, the better information it provides of the structure’s resources.

Lateral positions   are defined as those endowed with authority over a similar amount of resources in a simple social structure. These positions 4 It is theoretically possible to have a social structure with the specific criterion of「no criteria of exclusion and inclusion.」This case, for our purposes here, is equivalent to no formal or rigid criterion.

5   Institutions , in this volume, will be defined as sets of rules and procedures used by various social structures (see Chapter 11).

Theory and Research

can also form relationships with each other because they offer opportunities for information exchanges about the location and availability of resources in different positions. Such information facilitates better control and manipulation of a position’s resources, and access that ensures the maximal likelihood of preserving and/or gaining resources.

Transactions over resources can take place among these lateral positions when they are authorized to do so, or when rules and procedures do not prevent such exchanges and are not interpreted as sabotaging higher authority in the command chain. Horizontal linkages become especially relevant when collective action is geared to massing or combining available resources in the structure.

The Pyramid of a Hierarchy

Another assumption about the macrostructure of resources is that there is a general tendency for the hierarchical structure to have a pyramidal shape in terms of position distribution: the higher the level in the command chain, the fewer the number of positions and occupants (Lin 1982). The inverse relationship between the number of positions and their command of other positions is assumed for most social structures.

However, many evolving structures show a smaller bottom level than expected by this image, as industrialization and technological development continue to define or redefine the values of resources and to re-distribute positions and occupants accordingly. For example, in most industrialized societies, there is only a small segment of agricultural production and positions at the bottom of the command hierarchy.

An important consequence of pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures is that authority is concentrated in a few positions and occupants. At the very top, only a few positions and occupants not only command the largest absolute and relative amounts of valued resources, but also have the most comprehensive information on the location of resources in the structure.

Transactions in Complex Social Structures  Any existing social structure reflects a complexity that involves multiple hierarchical structures over many different kinds of valued resources. For most collectivities, the highly valued resources are associated with economic, social, and political dimensions. For example, Weber (1946) identifies three dimensions of「power」distribution in a community:   classes ,  status groups , and   parties . Because other terms have also been used in the literature regarding resources distributed in society and among indi-

vidual actors, a clarification of how these terms are defined and used in this monograph is needed.

Valued resources are distributed in three dimensions (social, economic, and political) and can characterize structural positions and individual actors. These characterizations are specified in Table 3.1.

For example, a socially highly regarded structural position can be characterized as a high-status「group.」Correspondingly, individual actors are considered as having better or worse reputations.6 Positions in possession of valued economic resources are considered upper class, and individuals occupying these positions are wealthy actors. Positions higher up in a hierarchical command structure are seen as more authoritative, and individual occupants are labeled as powerful.7

In any event, the theory assumes that while the uneven distribution of various valued resources forms the basis of hierarchical structures, and each valued resource defines a particular hierarchy, these hierarchies have a tendency toward congruence and transferability. That is, there tends to be a correspondence of occupants among hierarchical positions across valued resource or status dimensions. An occupant in a position of relatively high standing with respect to one resource also tends to occupy a relatively high position with respect to other resources. For example, a person with relatively high standing (status) in the occupational structure is also likely to hold a high position in the class and authority dimensions.

6   Prestige   has been used in the sociological literature to represent both statuses of positions (e.g., occupational prestige) and statuses of individuals. To avoid this confusion, and for important theoretical reasons (see Chapter 9), I choose the term   reputation   as an indicator of social standing for individuals.

7 Ambiguity concerning the term   power   remains. As used by Weber, it means general control over resources in a structural sense. For others (e.g., Emerson and Cook), power indicates the extent to which an individual actor, relative to other actors, controls alternative sources of resources. To avoid confusion, power is used in this volume as a characterization of individual actors or occupants.

38

Theory and Research

When such convergence is not functionally complete (i.e., a one-to-one relationship), exchange of resources across dimensions is not only possible but, in most societies, is explicit and expected. For example, an occupant with power resources can negotiate and trade with an occupant with wealth resources to acquire some of the latter’s wealth in exchange for lending power to the latter. The calculus of such transfers is usually institutionalized (with rules and procedures understood and practiced by individual actors) in a social structure.

Interaction and Homophily: Networking and

Social Capital

Social networks represent a less formal social structure in that there is little or no formality in delineating positions and rules and in allocating authority to participants. In social networks, fluidity characterizes the occupants, positions, resources, and rules and procedures. Mutual agreement through persuasion rather than authority or coercion dictates the actors’ participation and interaction, and defines the boundary and locations (positions) of participants’ (nodes). A particular network may evolve naturally or may be socially constructed for a particular shared focus or interest regarding a resource (e.g., protection of the environment, women’s rights). However, in general, a social network may be constructed for multiple interests in its different segments –

different interests link nodes in different parts of the network. Being in a node of a network directly and indirectly provides potential access to other nodes (actors) in the social network. Resources embedded in these nodes become ego’s social capital. As already pointed out, social capital reflects more than the mere personal resources of those nodes in the network. Since individual actors may be embedded in hierarchical structures and other networks, they bring to bear resources embedded in the positions of these hierarchies as well. These resources lie beyond the focus resource that might have been the initial reason for interacting. For example, individual actors may interact because of their shared interest in gun control or abortion issues, but they also bring to the interacting context their other personal and positional resources, such as their jobs and authority positions, wealth, and affiliations with religious institutions and political parties, as well as the networks and resources of their spouses, relatives, friends, and fellow workers.

Thus, interactions should be analyzed and understood not only as relationship patterns among individual actors or nodes but, much more importantly, as resource patterns linked in interaction patterns. The

The Structural Foundation  39

critical question then is: What patterns of resource linkage might be expected through interacting and networking?

The theoretical foundation for understanding interaction can be found in Homans’s (1950) studies of small primary groups. He postulated in principle the reciprocal and positive relationships among three factors: interaction, sentiment, and activity. The more individuals interact, the more likely they are to share sentiments and the more they engage in collective activity. Likewise, the more individuals share sentiments, the more likely they are to interact and engage in activities. The critical hypothesis for us here is the positive relationship between sentiment and interaction. That is, the basis of interaction is sentiment – affection, respect, sympathy, and liking for each other (Homans 1950, pp. 37–40) and vice versa. In other words, interaction is based primarily on shared emotion.

An important extension of the sentiment-interaction hypothesis is the homophily hypothesis. Largely a theoretical induction from research on patterns of friendship (Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954) and associations (Laumann 1966), the principle of   homophily , also known as the   like-me   hypothesis , is that   social interactions tend to take place among individuals with similar lifestyles and socioeconomic characteristics . Research has shown that interactions tend to occur among individual actors occupying similar or adjacent and slightly different social positions.

If we assume that socioeconomic characteristics and lifestyles reflect resources embedded in individuals and their hierarchical positions and network locations, then the homophilous principle of interaction implies a positive relationship between individuals with similar resources and the amount of their interaction, since similarity of social positions/locations is presumably characterized by similarity of types and amounts of resources. From the resource perspective, this suggests that interactions tend to occur among actors at the same or adjacent social positions in the hierarchy.

Thus, the Homans sentiment-interaction hypothesis becomes a sentiment-interaction-resources hypothesis. That is, there are triangular reciprocal relationships among sentiment, resources, and interaction that thus link interactions not only to shared sentiment, but also to similarity in resources. (See Figure 3.1.) While the sentiment-interaction hypothesis and the homophily hypothesis do not insist on a particular cause-and-effect sequence among the three elements, an important consequence of these hypotheses is that individuals whose positions are situated closer to each other in social structures are more likely to interact.

We may further extend the homophily principle to occupants of similar positions in multiple resource structures (e.g., authority, status, or class) because, by the rules of congruence and transferability of resources, interaction may engage partners with different kinds of resources as long

40

and Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954)

as the values of their resources are equivalent. For example, a banker and a senator may have different resources, but they are both high in their respective resource structures, and thus are more likely to engage in interaction than, say, the banker and a local manager of a fast-food shop.

Concluding Remarks

This chapter has outlined the structural foundation for social capital, conceived as   resources embedded in a social structure that are accessed   and/or mobilized in purposive actions . It has defined resources and conceptualizes how resources acquire value in a society. It has suggested how such valued resources are embedded in hierarchical and network structures that are differentiated in terms of their degree of formalization of positions, authority, rules, and agents. Differential opportunity structures emerge because embedded resources in these social structures are differentially accessed by individual actors in their web of social relations and because the principle of homophily is the normative expectation. In this formulation, social capital is shown to have significant structural character – the embedded resources in hierarchies and networks, their capture at least in part contingent on the opportunity structure afforded by the normative principle of interactions, or homophily. In the next chapter, this structural foundation of social capital will be elaborated and complemented with the incorporation of possible action and choice elements in completing the conceptualization of social capital.
