# 0104. Resources, Motivations, and Interactions

The Action Foundation

As conceptualized in the previous chapter, social capital is rooted in social networks and social relations and is conceived as resources embedded in a social structure that are accessed and/or mobilized in purposive actions. Thus conceived, social capital contains three components intersecting structure and action: structure (embeddedness), opportunity (accessibility through social networks), and action (use). The previous chapter has articulated the structural and opportunity aspects of social capital. This chapter will add the component of action to complete the theoretical foundation.

「It’s Not Just What You Know but Who You Know」: The Microstructure of Resources

The saying「It’s not just what you know but who you know」suggests that social capital should provide benefits for an individual who acts for a purpose. In this context, interaction is seen as a means to attain a goal of action. The task here is to understand how action is related to interaction and how agency is salient in the process of mobilizing social capital in a purposive action. I begin with a discussion of resources embedded in actors.

Individuals, like groups and organizations, gain and maintain valued resources to promote their well-being. They can mobilize and use such resources in purposive action to gain additional resources (see Chapter 1 for the discussion of neo-classical theories of capital).

Just as important, possession of or access to resources protects and promotes an individual’s standing in the social structure. Social recognition confers identity and reputation, providing recognized individuals with still more resources and a sense of worth and security within the structure. In general, two types of resources 41


can be defined for individual actors: personal resources and social resources.

Personal Resources as Human Capital

Personal resources are in the possession of individual actors who, as their owner, can use, transfer, and dispose of them without needing to receive specific authorization or be accountable to other actors or social positions.1 Acquisition of personal resources can be pursued down many avenues. One major route is by way of inheritance or ascription.

Resources may be declared the individual actor’s by transfer from parents, kin, or other actors. By the institutional rules of the community, they are passed on from one individual actor to another. Another avenue is to acquire them by investing one’s own resources or efforts. Education, for example, has been seen as an acquired resource through investment of parental or personal resources and personal efforts. Presumably, investment in education also leads to acquisition of other valued resources (e.g., power, wealth, and reputation) (see Chapter 1 on education as human and cultural capital).

A third way of acquiring personal resources is through exchange.

Acquisition of personal resources may involve a direct payment (money) or exchange of resources (bartering) through which title to resources is transferred from one individual actor to another. It is possible to delay the payment or exchange; in this case, a personal credit or debt is incurred on either side, with the expectation that the credit slip (promise of future payment) will be honored. Nevertheless, in pure exchange there is no expected obligation beyond the payment of the debt itself and no expectation of further exchanges. Personal property, commodities, money, and labor are typical resources in such exchange.

Some personal resources are fully owned by an individual actor (e.g., education, wealth) in the sense that the individual actor is free to use and dispose of them.2 But they are usually「owned」only by social contract, which designates an individual actor to be the user of specific resources – typical property rights designation (see Alchian 1965 and Alchian and Demsetz 1973 for a definition of property rights). As long as the contract is in force, the individual actor can exercise power in resource control and use. For example, an occupant of a position in a 1 However, a larger or external community’s (e.g., the state) sanction is necessary for such use and appropriation. See the references in footnote 2 in Chapter 3, in particular Willer (1985) on the legal sanctions for property rights.

2 Some resources are more difficult to dispose of than others. For example, education seems permanent after acquisition and certification, even though discrediting or disqualifica-tion (disownership) may still be possible and legitimate under certain conditions.

hierarchical structure has the right to control and use the resources attached to that position. These ownership rights expire when the individual actor is detached from that position. Therefore, it is useful to distinguish positional resources from the more fully owned personal resources.

While positional resources are less permanent, they are much more powerful as far as the other resources they control are concerned. Being part of a hierarchical structure with authority and linkages offers opportunities for the actor-occupant to have access to other actor-occupants and borrow or exchange resources. In other words, through structural connections, positions in hierarchical structures gain control and use of resources beyond those that these positions are allocated. It is in this context that we need to go beyond personal resources and explore resources accessed through social connections, that is, social capital.

Social Resources as Social Capital

As already indicated, not all resources available to individual actors are in their personal (including contractual) possession. In fact, personal resources for most individual actors are very limited. More likely, individual actors access resources through social ties. We define   social   resources , or   social capital , as those resources accessible through social connections. Social capital contains resources (e.g., wealth, power, and reputation, as well as social networks) of other individual actors to whom an individual actor can gain access through direct or indirect social ties. They are resources embedded in the ties of one’s networks.

Like personal resources, social resources may include material goods such as land, houses, car, and money and symbolic goods such as education, memberships in clubs, honorific degrees, nobility or organizational titles, family name, reputation, or fame.3

Resources an actor can be linked to through her or his social networks4

3 It is important to differentiate two types of social resources: social capital and cultural capital. Social capital is resources captured through social networks and social connections, whereas cultural capital is resources captured through social identification and reciprocal recognition. It is conceivable that some social resources, for certain actors, are captured through both identification (being a member of an ethnic group) and social networks (with ties to other members of the ethnic group), whereas other social resources for other actors are captured through either identification or social networks. Further articulation of the differentiation and integration of these two types of capital is beyond the scope of this volume. The focus here is on social resources captured through social relations – social capital.

4 Individual actors’ own knowledge of resources embedded in their ties may be only a subset of the actual types and amounts of their social capital. This is so for two reasons: they are unaware of all their alters’ (direct ties’) resources and/or of the ties and resources in their alters’ networks. Thus, individual actors’ social capital can be divided into two parts: (a) the portion that they are aware of and (b) the remaining unknown portion.

represent a repertoire of ego resources. Even if ego does not use or mobilize these resources, they have substantial symbolic utility. Letting others know about one’s social capital may be sufficient to promote one’s social standing. The symbolic utility occurs because such information imputes the potential power of ego by association. Spreading information about ego’s having a millionaire friend provides better social recognition for ego in her or his social circle because the alleged potential is there for ego to activate the connection and draw on that resource if necessary.

Symbolic utility also occurs because such a connection reflects ego’s social or cultural standing. Information about one’s acquaintance with a movie star may not impute any power in action, but it can enhance ego’s social recognition because it suggests that ego, through interactions with the movie star, could share and enjoy a lifestyle much admired in ego’s social circle. Mentioning a tie (「So and so is a friend,」「I talked to so and so yesterday」) may be sufficient to promote ego’s social standing. Of course, social capital can provide utility beyond its symbolic power. Actual use of social capital mobilizes it for a purposive action, a topic to be treated in Chapter 5.

Two important features of social capital deserve further clarification: (1) resources can be accessed through direct and indirect ties, and (2) such resources may be in alters’ possessions (their personal resources) or in their social positions (their positional resources). First, social capital includes the resources accessed through indirect ties. Resources of alters (direct ties) represent a relatively small portion of ego’s social capital.

Often social capital activates chains of multiple actors. In order to gain access to a certain resource (say, information about a job), ego may go to someone who does not possess that information but who may know someone else who does. In this case, the initial contact’s social networks become resources for ego. Thus, social capital does not come merely through direct connections or simple dyadic relationships. Both direct and indirect connections can afford access to resources. Through the direct and indirect ties of alters, actors’ social capital extends as far as their social networks. That is, social capital is contingent on resources embedded in direct and indirect ties and accessible through these ties.

Second, resources accessed through social ties include both these alters’

more or less permanent resources and the resources they control through their positions in a hierarchical structure, say an organization – their positional resources. In general, the positional resources of social ties are much more useful than personal resources to ego, because positional Actors’ self-reporting inevitably yields an incomplete and conservative estimate of their social capital’s potential repertoire. Self-reporting may yield different estimates than sociometric methods. There is no true estimate because that if social capital is not within individual actors’ cognitive maps, it may be inaccessible and not useful to them.

resources evoke not only the resources embedded in positions in an organization, but also the power, wealth, and reputation of the organization itself. Two equally competent professors who are respectively affiliated with an Ivy League university and a state four-year college, or two equally competent professional programmers, one of whom works for Microsoft and the other for a small local software company, will have quite unequal positional resources, even if their personal resources, including knowledge and earnings, are equal, because the positional and personal resources of their respective colleagues may be quite different in quality. Through these alters, ego gains access not only to their resources, both permanent and positional, but also potentially to resources through their connections in the organization, as well as the power, wealth, and status of the organization itself.

Furthermore, because each organization is located in a network of organizations, ego’s social capital extends beyond the limits of the organization. Through the organization’s linkages, both direct and indirect, to other organizations, and through the ties’ connections to these other organizations’ position occupants, ego’s social capital may extend to include resources embedded in these other organizations.

Motives for Resources: Purposive Actions

Once it has become clear that individual actors have in their possession and access valued resources, it is then not difficult to understand human actors’ motives for action and the consequences of different types of action. As stated in Chapter 2, both collectivities and individual actors take action for two primary motives: to protect existing valued resources and to gain additional ones. That is, it is assumed that actions are rational and are motivated to maintain or gain valued resources in order to survive and persist. The first motive dictates actions to preserve valued resources already at the individual’s disposal. The second motive promotes actions to acquire valued resources not yet at the individual’s disposal.

It is assumed that the motive to maintain valued resources promotes  expressive action.   Maintaining one’s resources requires recognition by others of one’s legitimacy in claiming property rights to these resources or sharing one’s sentiments. The action, of course, can be seen as instrumental in that ego has a goal in acting – to solicit sentiment and support.

However, the expected response is primarily expressive: acknowledging ego’s property rights or sharing ego’s sentiment. There is no action required beyond this public recognition and acknowledgment of others.

Examples include a mother talking with another mother about her affec-

46

Theory and Research

tion for her children, a woman talking to her mother about her husband’s watching too much football on television, a man sharing his feeling of admiration for a woman with a friend, and a man complaining about his boss to his wife. In these cases, the act of communicating serves as both means and goal; alters are expected to sympathize and empathize with ego and to appreciate and reciprocate ego’s feelings, thereby recognizing, legitimizing, and sharing ego’s claims to their resources.

Further, it is assumed that the motive to seek and gain additional valued resources primarily evokes   instrumental action,   which hopes to trigger actions and reactions from others leading to more allocation of resources to ego. Thus, the action can be seen as a means to achieve a goal: to produce a profit (added resources). Likewise, instrumental action contains expressive elements in that alter must have sentiment for ego to take action on ego’s behalf. However, action is required on alter’s part, and the end result is expected to be a gain for ego. Examples include seeking a job, promotion, salary, or bonus increase; getting a loan; finding a babysitter; or looking for a job for one’s son.

It should be noted that both types of action represent purpose or agency because motivations provide the drive to act. Of the two motivations for action – to maintain or to gain resources – it is assumed that the motivation to maintain and defend existing resources is the more important driving force. Losing resources in one’s possession poses a greater mental and physical threat to ego’s existence than not gaining additional resources. Thus, expressive action – action that seeks sentiment and support – is expected to take precedent over instrumental action (see Chapter 3).

These motivations for action result in two behavioral consequences: either actors can engage in activities by themselves that can produce better protection or gain resources, or they can engage one another to use one another’s resources. It is the latter case that is of interest here for a theory of social capital. Purposive actions must therefore be understood in terms of interactions that allow actors to access and use one another’s resources for their own purposes. We next examine the two types of interaction – homophilous and heterophilous – and assess their utilities for purposive actions.

Homophilous and Heterophilous Interactions

As explicated in the previous chapter, social interaction engages actors and thus intersects the resources embedded in the actors’ structural positions and social networks. The extent to which the intersecting resources are similar or different in quality, type, and amount may be considered

The Action Foundation

47

as variables ranging from identical to completely different. For simplic-ity’s sake, two types of interaction have been be identified and defined: homophilous and heterophilous. The former characterizes relations between two actors who have similar resources, which can include wealth, reputation, power, and lifestyle. The latter describes relations between two actors with dissimilar resources. As described in Chapter 3, homophilous interactions prevail, since the homophily principle links sentiment, interaction, and similarity of resources in actors’ reciprocal relationships.

While homophilous interaction has been much researched and examined, heterophilous interaction has received far less attention. The tendency has been to take heterophilous interaction as merely the opposite end of the continuum from homophilous interaction. Since there is a general tendency toward homophily in interaction, the logical deduction is that heterophilous interactions are less likely to occur. Given the hypothesized relationship between sentiments and interactions, the deduction has been that heterophilous interaction does not promote shared sentiment or that sentiment does not lead to heterophilous interaction.

Furthermore, heterophilous interactions demand effort, as the interacting partners, aware of the inequality in differential command over resources that can be brought to bear, need to assess each other’s willingness to engage in exchange. The resource-poorer partner needs to be concerned about alter’s intention or ability to appropriate resources from them. And the resource-richer partner needs to consider whether alters can reciprocate with resources meaningful to their already rich repertoire of resources. Thus, both partners in a heterophilous interaction have to make a greater effort in forging the interaction than those in a homophilous interaction. Heterophilous interactions therefore are relatively less likely to occur.

If this analysis is correct, one would also expect that when heterophilous interaction does occur, it requires more effort, probably at a greater cost, because of resource differentials and lack of shared sentiments. If homophilous interaction is the normative and ordinary interaction, then heterophilous interaction represents nonnormative and extraordinary interaction. What, then, motivates heterophilous interaction?

Action Guiding Interaction: Formation of Predictions One clue explaining motives for heterophilous interactions is provided by the finding already referred to, that individuals prefer to associate

with others with somewhat better social status. The   prestige hypothesis  (Laumann 1966) shows that preferred partners for interactions are those occupying slightly higher social statuses. Empirically, such behavior has been well documented as the   prestige effect . The implication is that such interaction is expected to enhance the prestige of the less advantaged actors. But the enhancement remains unclear, even though the term prestige hypothesis suggests a halo effect: a higher-status individual’s prestige rubs off on the actor seen with him or her. Such a halo effect (e.g., being admired for knowing a movie star or a Nobel Prize winner) by itself does not represent a permanent gain, since termination of the interaction might also result in the loss of the halo. What needs to be considered, then, is what an interacting partner with more resources represents.

It should be obvious by now that the explanation to be offered is this:  actors access social capital, through interactions, to promote purposive   actions.   Thus, the nature of embedded resources accessed in interactions becomes critical in the analysis of purposive actions and interaction patterns. This can be made clear by presenting the hypotheses in a typology of action and interaction, as shown in Table 4.1.

In this typology, the two motives for action are represented by two rows: maintaining resources or gaining resources. Two types of interaction relative to resources in the two columns are homophilous interactions, in which partners share similar resources, and heterophilous interactions, in which partners share dissimilar resources. Obviously, this is a simplification of many more gradations possible in reality, but it will serve for the purposes of our discussion here. Each cell represents the coupling of a particular purposive action and a particular type of interaction. Two variables can be used to describe each cell: how much effort is required for the interaction and how much return or payoff may result relative to the purposive action.

From the perspective of social interactions, the homophily principle points to the triangular relationships among sentiments, interactions, and shared resources. It provides a structural explanation for   least-effort   interactions; interactions tend to promote sentiment and shared resources and vice versa. It is expected, then, that the homophilous interaction is the preferred and more frequent type of interaction; the least-effort homophilous interaction should be the expected pervasive pattern of interactions observed.

The purpose of expressive action, therefore, is consistent with this pattern of interaction. This type of action is likely to result in ego’s seeking out other actors who have similar resources and a similar interest in maintaining and defending them. The more similar the partners’

resources, the more likely they will share an understanding and concern for maintaining or defending such resources. Empathy and common concern promote interaction. Furthermore, the more homophilous the interacting partners are in terms of resources, the more socially equal they are. Thus, there is less concern regarding the possible intention or ability of alter to appropriate resources from ego. The cost of guarding and defending resources is reduced. The return, relative to the motivation for action, is also expected to be better.

Defending one’s resources requires the sentiments and support of those who are in the same social groups or those who are in a similar position (e.g., class) in the hierarchical structure. In other words, action taken to protect and maintain resources is consistent with normative patterns of interaction. At the extreme, then, normative interactions sustain maintenance of resources among individuals without the need to stress the action component.

Gaining resources, on the other hand, implies a different type of interaction. It is argued that the action to gain resources is better served, in terms of return, if the actor engages in heterophilous interactions –

finding actors with dissimilar resources. In Chapter 3 it was pointed out that in macrostructures, social positions are characterized by the resources they control and manipulate. Interaction, then, represents not only the joining of two actors but also, much more important, the joining of two social positions that the actors occupy. Interacting with an actor who controlls more resources means interacting with a social position with more resources. A higher position in the hierarchical structure not only controls and manipulates more resources, but also has greater command and a better view of other positions in the structure. Access to such a position affords the possibility of borrowing that command or that view. If the resource an actor wants to gain is located in a social structure (e.g., in the hands of someone who occupies a position in that

50

Theory and Research

structure), then it follows that interacting with an alter who occupies a higher position in that hierarchy might have the benefit of finding that position (through alter’s better view of the structure) or of mobilizing alter’s commands for moving ego to link up with that position or even to occupy it.

Further, this benefit goes beyond the hierarchical structure in which alter holds an advantaged position. By the rules of compatibility and transferability across different hierarchical structures, alter may also exercise influence by providing information regarding other structural positions or by helping ego establish links to another actor in the structure where that actor holds an advantaged position, from which this third actor might exercise authority to help ego find resources or occupy a sought-after position.

While heterophilous interactions therefore may provide the social capital useful for attaining such a goal for an actor taking an instrumental action, the effort is more costly. That is, obtaining additional or better resources requires interacting, directly or indirectly, with actors in other (and better) positions so that more and better information or authority/influence may be obtained. It means seeking out actors in different social positions than ego’s. Two factors make such efforts more difficult. First, the homophily principle suggests that a normative tendency is for actors of similar resources to engage each other. Finding and engaging others of dissimilar resources represents extraordinary interactions requiring greater effort.

Second, it should be clear by now that heterophilous interaction, as described here, goes beyond simply the reversal of homophilous interaction. It is more than merely interaction between dissimilar actors. From an actor’s point of view, the payoff may come from interacting with another actor who is not only different but also has better resources.

Since actors occupy hierarchical positions in society, ego would need to interact with someone who not only possesses more highly valued resources but also, more importantly, occupies a higher hierarchical position. Thus, as shall be made more explicit in the next chapter, heterophilous interactions have better returns if the partner occupies a higher, not lower, hierarchical position relative to ego. In such asymmetric interactions, while an actor seeking more resources may have much to gain, the payoff for the other partner (alter) in the interaction poses a serious problem: What favor can ego return to alter, who has better resources? Or why should alter respond by offering its resources as social capital to ego? Asymmetric exchanges, as heterophilous interactions imply, require further articulation, a topic I will treat in Chapter 9. Suffice it to state here that heterophilous interactions are costly and unusual.

The Action Foundation

51

Heterophilous interaction occurs, therefore, despite the fact that it requires greater effort to reach out beyond one’s own social circles, and is more costly in commitments to reciprocity and the offer of one’s resources for the initiating actors. In short, instrumental action requires a greater degree of agency to overcome the normative homophilous pattern of interaction.

Structural Constraint and Opportunity

in Capitalization

The predictions based merely on action and interaction, as projected in Table 4.1, however, are tempered by necessary considerations of the structural positions and network locations the engaging actors occupy.

More specifically, without an appreciation of the hierarchical structure and its constraints, heterophilous interaction by itself would make a poor prediction of instrumental return. Consider a bank president, who occupies a high-level position in the local community and beyond and who socializes with other highly positioned actors, as the homophilous principle would predict. Interacting with others with similar resources reinforces his or her position in the hierarchy, as the expressive action intends. However, when the bank president engages in instrumental action, would he or she need to engage others with dissimilar resources, as the heterophilous principle would predict? If valued resources are transferrable (see Chapter 4 on the transactions in complex structures), then we would expect the bank president to interact with others who may have different types of resources (e.g., power rather than wealth) but who nevertheless occupy a similar position in the complex hierarchical structure of the community – a homophilous interaction.

Likewise, actors occupying the lowest level of positions are not expected to garner as much return from heterophilous interactions as higher-level actors. As the distribution of positions and occupants in the pyramidal structure dictates, they are much more likely to engage in homophilous interactions (i.e., there are more actors like themselves in the structure, so that the opportunity for homophilous interactions is higher) and to find it much more difficult to engage others with higher positions (i.e., they have much less to offer in return for favors by those in higher positions). Thus, heterophilous interactions are less likely to produce the greater returns in their instrumental actions, as expected from Table 4.1.

It is therefore important to incorporate this hierarchical/structural dimension. The predictions presented in Table 4.1 may hold in general, but probably not for those who occupy elite positions in the structure.

52

Theory and Research

For them, heterophilous interactions offer no greater return than homophilous interactions if multiple hierarchies implicating different types of valued resources are to be treated simultaneously. Structure does provide opportunities for some and constraints for others.

Concluding Remarks

This chapter, by specifying the motivations for action and the possible effort and return for such purposive actions in different types of interactions, and by bringing the action aspect and the structural aspect together, has set the stage for a formal presentation of a theory of social capital in the next chapter. Here we clarify the debate on action versus structure in the process of social capitalization: the process by which structural resources are turned into social capital. That is, does social capitalization represent purposive action on the part of the actor or does it simply reflect the structural opportunity present for an actor?

Classic capital theory and cultural capital theory (Bourdieu 1972/

1977; Bourdieu and Passeron 1977) both see structural constraints or opportunities as decisive. Action is anticipated on the part of those in advantaged positions. For Bourdieu, the structural imposition is reflected in the dominant class’s socializing other members of the society (e.g., through education) with the elite’s values and norms, so that these others misrecognize the values and norms as their own. Individuals do use strategies of action to adopt and attain these values and norms, but such adaptation and action merely serve to reinforce the structural reproduction of the system that privileges the already dominant.

For most human capital theorists as well as some social capital theorists, the purposive action initiated by the actor seems to be the driving force behind the investment and mobilization of resources as capital.

Actors’ purposive actions may be constrained by their structural positions or network locations, but in this conception, even occupants of advantaged positions and locations cannot benefit from their positions/locations unless they initiate action to bring about desired results.

For Coleman, social capital is defined by the function it serves for a particular purpose and a particular actor (Coleman 1990, Chap. 12). If something embedded in the structure works for an individual for a particular action, then it is social capital. The same thing in another action and for another actor would not necessarily be social capital, as it may not serve the function. The concept has also been extended by Putnam (1993, 1995a, 1995b) and others to refer to participation in voluntary organizations, social clubs, and social groups, as it reflects trust in social

institutions (Hardin 1998) and may be linked to the well-being of the society.

Granovetter (1974) points to the process of gaining information advantages through weaker ties and bridges. He does not specifically argue that actors are conscious of this advantage, or that they make efforts to use weaker ties or bridges. However, since normatively more frequent interactions tend to occur within one’s own social circle (among persons with stronger ties), the implicit suggestion is that the use of weaker ties or bridges represents extraordinary effort – thus, purposive actions.

Burt’s (1992) theory of structural holes says nothing about action. Yet, central to the utility of structural holes is an actor’s calculation of profit, which is a joint function (multiplication) of investment and the「rate of return,」as represented by structural opportunities. Burt analyzes structural opportunities in terms of structural holes and structural autonomy, expecting those with structural opportunities to take advantage of these resources and capital by taking action (investing) to generate a profit.

Thus, for Burt, active manipulation of resources by the actor is assumed.

In fact, he prefers the term   players   to   actors   to emphasize this point.

While these theorists hint at the action aspect, it remains implicit in their theories rather than being the focal point or the driving element.

The theory of social capital offered here and elsewhere makes this action aspect more explicit (Lin 1982). From the resource perspective, action is important and is given equal significance relative to structure. Motivated action guides interactions. Instrumental action, in particular, motivates investing – seeking out and mobilizing – in relations and connections that may provide access to social resources. Making explicit the hints of purposive action suggested by Granovetter and Burt, the theory of social capital gives primacy to the propensity to act in order to gain access and mobilize better social resources. However, the effort at investment and mobilization is constrained by the extent of resources’ availability and heterogeneity in the social structures in which actors find themselves.

Actors are further constrained by their particular position in hierarchical structures and their location in the network. Given existing social structures, this constraint looms as large and significant. Thus, in any empirical study, structural effects must not be ignored or underestimated.

In causal terms, however, it would be impossible to tease out the sequence in which either action or structure more significantly dictates access to social capital. Chapter 8 will propose the theoretical possibility that it is action that leads to social structures through the mobilization of social resources or social capital.

One puzzle that needs to be dealt with is how individual actors can use resources in the social structures for their own benefit rather than

54

Theory and Research

for the benefit of the social structures. As mentioned before, actors, as agents in social structures, are expected to take actions to maintain and promote the structural resources. How, then, can actors/occupants appropriate such positional resources for their own interests instead?

In general, social structure and individual actors reinforce each other: the structure rewards individual actors who support and recognize its valued resources, and individual actors strive to recognize and promote structural resources in order to gain status or better positions in the structure. However, actors/agents, empowered to interpret rules and procedures and to mobilize resources in the social structure, can and will trigger structural changes (Sewell 1992). Variations in their perception and interpretation of rules, and in their assessment of resource availability and needs, differ among agents due to their different experiences in socialization or professionalization. These variations bring about changes within a social structure as well as in a new structure to which the rules and procedures of an existing structure are supposedly trans-posed (Sewell 1992).

Furthermore, resources considered valuable by the social structure and its agents are not entirely identical. As both the collectivity and individual actors as agents strive to promote their own interests, and as the collectivity empowers the agents to interpret the rules and procedures and to mobilize resources, individual actors have the opportunity to promote their own interests. One way to promote self-interest is to mobilize and manipulate resources entrusted to the positions that actors occupy. A second way is to use linkages to other positions and their occupants, and to mobilize and manipulate their resources as well. These issues, directly implicating social change, will be dealt with in Chapter 11.

It is these structurally empowered relationships among positions and embedded resources that offer opportunities for the actors/occupants –

the agents – to gain access to structural resources for their own interests.

That is, these structural opportunities become social capital of the actors/occupants.
