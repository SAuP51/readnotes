Propositions

The discussions of the structure, interaction, and action aspects of social capital described in the previous three chapters have laid the ground-work for specifying propositions to guide research. This chapter will summarize the major principles presented so far and will then present the theory’s principal propositions.

The Theory of Social Capital

The theory of social capital focuses on the resources embedded in one’s social network and how access to and use of such resources benefit the individual’s actions. Resources are defined as valued goods in a society, however consensually determined, the possession of which maintains and promotes an individual’s self-interest for survival and preservation. The values are normative judgments rendered on these goods. For most societies, they correspond to wealth, reputation, and power. The theory focuses on those actions that are taken for the purpose of either maintaining or gaining valued resources.

Resources can be either ascribed or acquired.   Ascribed resources   are those one is born with, such as gender and race. Other resources are pre-scribed by inheritance, such as caste and sometimes religion, and may include parental resources. Resources can also be acquired, such as education, or prestigious or authoritative jobs. When resources are being invested for expected returns in the marketplace, they become social capital.

Capital can be classified into two types: (1) personal or human capital and (2) social capital.1 Human capital consists of resources possessed by the individual, who can use and dispose of them with great freedom and 1 As stated in footnote 2 of Chapter 4, social resources may also include cultural capital.

without much concern for compensation. Social capital consists of resources embedded in one’s network or associations. Our focus here is on social capital, which is not the individual’s possessed goods, but resources accessible through direct and indirect ties. Access to and use of these resources is temporary and borrowed in the sense that the actor does not possess them. A friend’s bicycle is one’s social capital. One can use it to achieve a certain goal, but it must be returned to the friend.

One implication of the use of social capital is its assumed obligation for reciprocity or compensation.

Assumptions

The theory of social capital is framed in a set of assumptions about the macro-, meso-, and microstructures of society. For the macrostructure, the theory posits three assumptions. First, the theory begins with an image of the social structure, which consists of a set of positions that are rank-ordered according to certain normatively valued resources such as class, authority, and status. It further assumes that the structure has a pyramidal shape in terms of accessibility to and control of such resources. The higher the position, the fewer the occupants; and the higher the position, the better the view it has of the structure (especially down below). In terms of both number of occupants and accessibility to positions, the pyramidal structure suggests advantages for positions closer to the top.

A position closer to the top of the structure has greater access to and control of the valued resources not only because more valued resources are intrinsically attached to that position, but also because of the position’s greater accessibility to positions at other (primarily lower) rankings. Thus, an individual occupying a higher position, because of its accessibility to more positions, also has a greater command of social capital.

With such an image of the social structure and an understanding of embedded resources, it is apparent that there is a direct relationship between the level of a position in the hierarchical structure and the amount of influence it may exert on other (lower) positions for instrumental purposes (obtaining additional resources), as well as the amount of information it possesses about the locations of resources in the structure. The influence factor derives from the ability of higher positions to cumulate resources at a higher rate than lower positions. Thus, any favor an individual at the higher position may provide can be expected to have a greater future payoff, since the higher position has more to offer the lower position than vice versa. The information factor is associated with

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  57

asymmetric network relations across levels of positions. A higher position tends to have more information or a better view of the structure than a lower position; thus, it is more capable of locating the specific resources embedded in the structure.

Second, the theory assumes that while various valued resources form the bases of hierarchical structures and each valued resource defines a particular hierarchy, these hierarchies tend toward congruence and transferability. That is, there tends to be a correspondence among hierarchical positioning across resource dimensions. An occupant of a relatively high-standing position on one resource dimension also tends to occupy a relatively high position on another resource dimension. For example, a person with a relatively high standing on the occupational structure is also likely to have great wealth and power. When such convergence is not functionally complete (not isomorphic), exchange of resources across dimensions is not only possible but, in most societies, explicit and expected. For example, an occupant with power resources can negotiate and trade with an occupant with wealth resources to acquire some of the latter’s wealth in exchange for lending power to the latter.

Third, the theory assumes that this hierarchical structure tends to be pyramidal, the upper levels having fewer occupants than the lower levels.

An empirical structure may not actually look pyramidal because each such structure is evolving and shifting toward a redefined set of levels.

For example, as industrialization progresses (defined as the process of developing technology to make machine tools and assumed to be observable in every modern society), the occupational structure deviates from the pyramidal structure as occupants shift from the agricultural to the nonagricultural sector. While the size of the agricultural population deceases and the size of the low-level nonagricultural sector increases, the occupational structure, in terms of numbers of occupants at various levels, tends to be vase-shaped. Similarly, as the level of education in a society rises, there is always a small trailing tail at the lowest level representing the「residual」groups consisting of the most poorly educated individuals.

For the meso- and microstructures, the theory makes two assumptions about interactions and actions. First, it assumes that social interactions are more likely to take place among individuals at similar or adjacent hierarchical levels – the principle of homophilous interactions. Following from the structural assumption about congruence and transferability of resources, expected or fair exchange involves partners who can offer as well as receive resources. Thus, the closer or more similar the social positions, the more likely it is that the occupants will interact with one another. The theory assumes that   two primary driving forces  account for most individuals’ actions: maintaining valued resources and

58

Theory and Research

gaining valued resources. The first dictates actions undertaken to preserve and defend valued resources already at the individual’s disposal, whereas the second promotes actions undertaken to add valued resources not yet at the individual’s disposal. We may characterize them as expressive and instrumental actions, respectively.

Expressive actions are expected to result in interactions consistent with the principle of homophilous interaction. Recognition of the similarity of resources and of the need to reciprocate concerns about them and protect them constitutes the basis for satisfying interactions. This expectation is consistent with the observation that interactions tend not only to take place more often but also to be more satisfying among participants with similar socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyles, and attitudes (Homans 1950; Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954). These similarities are assumed to reflect the proximity of social positions in the hierarchical structure. In social systems where valued resources are distributed across all levels (i.e., where every individual in the system has some quantity of the resources), homophilous interactions are pervasive at all levels. In most empirical social systems, therefore, this pattern holds true.

Instrumental action, in contrast, may not result in interaction patterns consistent with the homophilous principle and the structural expectations. To gain additional or new resources, by definition, requires access to other social positions (especially those with more or better resources).

That is, for the purpose of obtaining additional resources, more   effective   actions tend to be initiated toward others who have dissimilar (and presumably better) resources, consistent with the heterophilous principle of interactions.2

Thus, a theory linking individuals to structure must first distinguish the two classes of action: instrumental actions and expressive actions.

Instrumental actions are those actions taken for the purpose of achieving certain goals. The distinctive feature of this class of actions is that the means and ends are separate and distinct. A typical example is the search for a job or a person. Expressive actions are taken for their own sake: the actions are both means and ends, and are integrated and inseparable. Confiding one’s feelings is a typical example. The social capital theory varies in its propositions relative to instrumental and expressive actions.

2 Instrumental actions can also be initiated by an occupant of a higher position toward an occupant of a lower position, since the latter provides many necessary services. Since the higher position commands and has greater access to resources than the lower position, the occupant of the lower position is normally obligated to respond to the action initiated by the higher-level occupant in the hope of receiving a reward. In this chapter, the focus will be on individuals who seek better resources. In Chapter 9, I will further elaborate the rationale for asymmetric exchanges.

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  59

Second, the theory must take into account the consistency or tension between action and interaction. An expressive action motivates the individual to seek out others with similar characteristics and lifestyles in order to share and confide so that the expected return, sympathetic and appreciative understanding and counseling, can be obtained. Since homophilous interaction is the normative type of interaction, the expressive action evokes normative interaction (the homophilous interaction).

That is, there is a normative match between effort and return. On the other hand, an instrumental action motivates one to seek out others with dissimilar (and, it is hoped, better) characteristics and lifestyles in order to access information and influence to achieve the expected return of more and/or better resources. Thus, heterophilous interactions represent a potential mismatch between the extraordinary or「abnormative」effort and expected returns for the purposive (instrumental) action.

Because of the mismatch between instrumental action and normative patterns of interaction, a theory of social capital should pay special attention to the process by which instrumental action becomes successful through social capital.

Theoretical Propositions: Structurally Embedded Resources and Purposive Actions

The theory specified here also applies only to a class of actions that evoke other actors as intermediaries. Under certain conditions, an action may be accomplished without going through intermediaries. For example, in a perfect labor market system, where all job vacancies and their required skills are known to all who seek jobs, and recruitment of an applicant to fill the job depends entirely on the matching of required skills and each candidate’s skills, there would be little need to use a contact; direct application should accomplish all goals. Similarly, if the searcher knows everyone else in the social system, there would be no need for him or her to go through a contact to locate someone else. A contact becomes a requirement only when the searcher does not know the target person directly. Thus, the theory applies in an imperfect market where the diffusion of information about the goal is less than perfect. I am assuming that this condition covers most if not all real market situations.

For the theory linking social capital to action, seven propositions are specified:

1. For the return of social capital (Proposition 1: the social-capital proposition)

2. For the access to social capital

60

Theory and Research

• The advantage of structural positions (Proposition 2: the

「strength-of-positions」proposition)

• The advantages of social ties (Proposition 3: the「strength-of-strong-tie」proposition and Proposition 4: the「strength-of-weak-tie」proposition)

• The advantage of network locations (Proposition 5: the

「strength-of-location」proposition)

• The interaction between network locations and structural positions (Proposition 6: the location-by-position proposition)

• The interaction of structural positions and ties/locations (Proposition 7: the structural contingency proposition)3

The first proposition is the pivotal proposition expressing the expected return of social capital; it hypothesizes that better social capital accessed and used will tend to lead to a more successful outcome. The five other propositions hypothesize factors leading to better access and use of social capital. The strength-of-position proposition argues that the social position of origin has a positive effect on accessing and using better social capital. The strength-of-tie proposition posits that the use of weaker social ties (more heterophilous interactions) will have a positive effect on accessing and using social capital. The strength-of-position proposition reflects structural effects on instrumental action, whereas the strength-of-tie proposition may reflect action effects. It is also hypothesized that there will be interaction effects between position, tie, and location. In general, it is expected that the structural effect is stronger than the action effect. The relative strength of structure over action is more prominent near the top or bottom of the hierarchical structure. In the following section, these propositions will be explicated.

Return to Social Capital

(1) The Social-Capital Proposition: The success of action is positively   associated with social capital.   The primary proposition of the theory states that access to and use of better social capital leads to more successful action – the return to social capital. A simple strategy to accomplish a purposive action is to access an actor who possesses or can access more highly valued resources. Such access, as stated in Chapter 2, makes use of social capital for several important advantages. First, it makes use of the influence this intermediary may exercise on behalf of ego. The 3 The earliest version of this theory and some of its propositions appear in Lin (1982), and subsequent versions and revisions appear in several other publications (Lin 1986, 1990, 1992a, 1995a, 1999a).

better positioned the intermediary, and thus the better embedded and commanded resources, the more such influence should benefit ego.

Second, the intermediary, given its advantageous view of the structure, may provide better information to ego. Third, a better-positioned intermediary, with its embedded and commanded resources, projects better social credentials, so that its willingness to serve as an intermediary assures or elevates ego’s credentials. And, finally, the ability to access a better-positioned intermediary itself enhances ego’s confidence and self-esteem in further interactions and actions (e.g., conduct in job interviews) that may be necessary to accomplish the goal of the action. Thus, the first and most important proposition for the theory is:   The success of   action is positively associated with social capital . It is argued that the relationship should hold for both expressive and instrumental actions.

Graphically, this proposition is depicted in Figure 5.1. The hierarchical nature of a social structure can be represented by the pyramid: levels of positions with varying degrees of valued resources can be plotted along its vertical axis. For two egos (identified as e1 and e2 in the figure), at approximately the same structural position, the proposition hypothesizes that e1 will have a competitive advantage over e2 as it accesses a social tie, a1, at a relatively higher position than that of the tie, a2, that e2 accesses.

Through direct and indirect ties, an individual actor gains access to a variety of resources; what measures can be suggested as indicators of social capital? Following Weber’s argument, we may suggest three types of resources of social ties accessed as the contents of social capital: (1)

62

Theory and Research

Figure 5.2 Measures of social capital.

wealth: economic assets, (2) power: political assets, and (3) reputation: social assets. Three summarizing characteristics can be suggested relative to each capital: (1) upper reachability: the best resource accessed through social ties; (2) heterogeneity: the range of positions whose resources are reachable through social ties; and (3) extensity: the number of positions that are reachable. These criteria and their measures are graphically depicted in Figure 5.2.

The first criterion of upper reachability seems straightforward: the resource of an uppermost position ego can reach in the hierarchical structure through social ties. As in Figure 2.2, ego is connected to other positions in the structure; the highest position ego can reach represents the upper-reachable social resource for ego. That position is characterized by the values of resources it possesses, usually reflecting relative status, class, or authority in the structure or community.

The second criterion, resource heterogeneity, reflects the vertical range of resources reachable by ego through social ties across positions in a structural hierarchy. As in Figure 1.2, this is represented by the range between the highest- and lowest-reachable resources through ego’s ties.

The resource heterogeneity criterion is not so obvious, but it is important. For example, an individual who does not know how to increase computer memory to run an application may not need to contact a high-status programmer; it should be sufficient to call on someone friendly who can quickly help. Nor is it necessary to call on a neighbor with many resources when ego needs a babysitter at the last minute. Getting one’s basket emptied or floor swept at the office depends more on friendly rela-

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  63

tions with the custodians than on making demands on one’s supervisor.

Thus, having all social ties of high status may not meet many life needs.

Thus, heterogeneity in the types, levels, and amounts of resources provided through social ties constitutes an important criterion of better access to social capital. The third criterion, extensity, simply reflects the diversity of positions, and their embedded resources, reachable by ego through social ties.

Actual measures of these economic, political, and social standings vary for each society or even each community. Therefore, identifying the locally meaningful measures of social capital for a given society is an empirical task. As long as such locally meaningful measures can be identified and examined, the proposed proposition is hypothesized to hold.

The correlations among the various measures of social capital, while generally assumed to be high, may also vary across societies and communities. To assess their correspondences for each society under study, and to exercise appropriate methodological controls to reflect the degree of convergence or distinction among the measures, is again an empirical task. Further, the relative utility of the social capital measures may depend on the purposes or motivations for action. As has been stated, action may be undertaken for expressive (maintaining resources) or instrumental (gaining resources) reasons. Whether the relative advantage among the social capital measures differs or not for different types of actions again may vary across societies and communities. In some societies, where the three measures of social capital largely overlap or correspond well, their utilities may also converge for both types of action. In other societies, when these assets are more segmented or independent, it becomes critical to assess their relative effects for the two types of actions.

The social-capital proposition is the primary proposition of the theory in that unless it can be verified in research, all other propositions become irrelevant. On the other hand, if this proposition is verified, then the stage is set for further propositions and elaborations. In the remainder of this chapter, we will focus on several other propositions concerning the etiology or causes of social capital – the factors determining the likelihood of achieving better social capital.

Accessing Social Capital

Who, then, is more likely to gain better access to social capital? We propose three possible factors: (1) the position of ego in hierarchical structures, (2) the nature of the tie between ego and the other actors, and (3) the location of the ties in the networks. These three factors lead to four theoretical propositions concerning access to social capital: (1) the strength of the ego’s structural position, (2) the strength of the tie,

64

Theory and Research

(3) the strength of the location of the tie, and (4) the joint (interaction) effect of the position, the tie, and the location.

Structural Advantage.   The principle of homophily has been used to describe normative and expressive interactive patterns. This principle suggests that persons, for expressive reasons, tend to interact with others who are like themselves. When this principle is applied to the issue of who tends to attain better social capital, it should be obvious that those whose initial positions are relatively high in the social structure should have the advantage over others. The initial position may be inherited from parents or achieved by the individual. Once such an initial position is located, the normative interactive patterns for the position’s particular occupant link it with others at similar or higher positions. The higher the initial position, the more likely the occupant will have access to more highly-valued resources. Thus, it is hypothesized that the level of the initial position is positively related to the social capital reached through a contact, known as the strength-of-position proposition.

(2) The Strength-of-Position Proposition: The better the position of   origin, the more likely the actor will access and use better social capital.

Figure 5.3 illustrates two egos, e1 and e2, with relative positions in the hierarchy that are predicted to access alters at different higher positions.

Thus, e1 is said to have a better positional or structural advantage over e2 in access to better social capital.

Figure 5.3 Relative advantages of structural positions for accessing social capital.

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  65

This proposition predicts a structural effect on social capital: those in better social positions will have the advantage in accessing and mobilizing social ties with better resources.   Position of origin   refers to both ascribed and attained positions of ego.   Ascribed position   is a position inherited by ego, usually from parents.   Attained positions   refer to social positions and social roles acquired and occupied by ego. Thus, the strength-of-position proposition predicts that those in better ascribed and occupied positions will also have a better chance of accessing and using social ties with better resources. This proposition is entirely consistent with the conventional structural theory; it reflects the structural advantage for actors and extends this structural effect to social capital.

The haves will have more. It is argued that this relationship holds for both expressive and instrumental actions.

The strength-of-position proposition extends resources accessed beyond the homophily principle. Not only is an individual occupying a higher position more likely to have social connections with similar positions, but these other positions have their own connections whose social capital also becomes accessible to ego. By the same principle, these positions and their social capital should be similar to those with which ego has direct connections. Thus, these indirect connections further increase ego’s propensity to access even wider resources. The strength-of-position proposition, therefore, suggests that the higher the individuals’ own positions, the greater their likelihood of having access to better social capital.

Networking Advantages.   The upshot of the strength-of-position proposition is that the structural opportunity for reaching better social capital is much better for those whose initial positions are relatively high. The next question is whether there is a mechanism by which persons at relatively low initial positions can reach better social capital. Or, when two actors occupy approximately the same position in the structure, would their actions make any difference in the outcome?

The proposal here is that access to social capital is also affected by ego’s relationships with others in social networks. However, several principles would lead to different propositions. We will consider these in a logical sequence – from a structural perspective, to an opportunity perspective, to a choice perspective, and to a combination of these perspectives.

(3) The Strength-of-Strong-Tie Proposition: The stronger the tie, the   more likely that the social capital accessed will positively affect the   success of expressive action.   The structural principle is straightforward: accessible resources are positively related to social ties to those alters with whom ego shares stronger sentiment. We may call this principle the

66

Theory and Research

strength-of-strong-tie proposition . The strength of a relationship among those with social ties reflects their degree of intensity, frequency of intimacy (trustworthiness), reciprocity, and acknowledged obligations (Granovetter 1973). The stronger the relationship, the more likely the sharing and exchange of resources.

Mutual support and recognition go hand in hand with promotion of the ego and alter’s resources, including their reputation. Thus, such a relationship is mutually tolerant and even encourages social debts and credits, as well as forgiveness of debt. Coleman (1990) describes any social structure with a higher than average density of obligations as a group with   closure . The present proposition focuses on the likelihood of ego accessing others’ resources because of the strength of ego’s relationship with them. That is, even if alter has better resources, alter may not respond to ego’s desire to gain access to them if their relationship does not reflect normative reciprocity, trust, and mutual obligations. Closer relationships are a necessary condition for getting access to social capital. There has been substantial argument (Bourdieu 1980, 1983/

1986; Coleman 1990; Portes and Sensenbrenner 1993) for the effectiveness of dense, cohesive, interactive, reciprocatory, trustworthy networks as resources for participating actors.

These analyses suggest that stronger ties based on sentiment, trust, and sharing of resources and lifestyles support the maintenance and reinforcement of existing resources – consistency with expressive action.

Thus, the proposition:   the stronger the tie, the more likely the social   capital accessed will positively affect the success of expressive action .

However, the modified principle of homophily (Figure 2.1) tells us that interaction, sentiments, and similarity in resources are positively related.

Thus, stronger ties allow access to social capital that is similar or perhaps slightly different (e.g., better) than ego’s own – the exact prediction made by the strength-of-position proposition. Once the principle of homophily is extended to resources, the access effects of stronger ties are accounted for. Thus, the strength-of-strong-tie principle reflects a structural advantage.

The interesting aspect of interaction and networking is that, unlike social positions, which are more or less fixed unless or until social change takes place (a topic to be dealt with in Chapter 11), strength of ties and location of resources in the networks are variable. An individual has weaker as well as stronger sentiments for the interacting partners. The strength of these partners’ relationships with others also varies. Also, in networks, because of both direct and indirect ties, ego’s location in the network varies. These variations in tie strength and network location suggest that further propositions need to be developed regarding how such variations may affect an individual’s access to social capital. In other

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  67

words, is there any benefit for ego if the strength of the tie is weaker rather than stronger and if ego’s position is closer to the fringe than to the core of the network?

(4) The Strength-of-Weak-Tie Proposition: The weaker the tie, the more   likely ego will have access to better social capital for instrumental action.

Granovetter (1973, 1974) was among the first to theoretically examine issues involving the strength of weaker ties. Following Homans’s conceptualization and the homophily principle, he envisioned social circles as being distinguished by denser and more reciprocally interactive partners. An individual embedded in a social circle tends to have characteristics homophilous with those of the circle’s other members; these similarities also extend to information. In addition, knowledge about larger social structures is homophilous among members of a social circle.

If individuals need different information, then they may be more likely to find it in different social circles than their own. To reach another social circle, ego would need to find ties that link the two circles. The ties between different social circles are   bridges ; without the linkage, the two social circles would be independent of each other.

Granovetter further argues that the tie between two individuals forming a bridge, for example, is weaker because each individual participates in a different social circle. There is also the implication, although he does not state it, that these bridging individuals tend to be on the margin of their respective social circles, as evidenced by their maintaining ties to other social circles, perhaps reducing the strength of their interactions with others in their own circles. Since stronger ties can be characterized by intensity, intimacy, frequency of contacts, acknowledged obligations, and provision of reciprocal services, individuals’

chances of gaining better information are enhanced if they explore, among their ties, the weaker rather than the stronger ones, in order to find likely bridges to other social circles. Granovetter calls this strategy and benefit「the strength of weak ties.」4

4 The relational characterizations of the weak ties did not break any new ground, as they could be deduced directly from the homophily principle of interaction. Recall that the principle states that interaction tends to occur among actors with similar characteristics and lifestyles. The reverse statement is that interactions do not tend to occur among actors with dissimilar characteristics and lifestyles. If a social group or social circle is characterized by dense interactions and connections, then the homophily principle would predict that members must share similar characteristics and lifestyles, and therefore information as well. Since the connection with the other group is tenuous (only through a bridge), the homophily principle would also predict that the members of the two groups can be differentiated by their different characteristics, lifestyles, and therefore information.

The significance of the strength-of-weak-ties argument lies rather in its pointing out that the weak ties, because of their tenuous relationship, contribute to the flow of infor-

68

Theory and Research

Figure 5.4 Relative advantages of weaker ties.

The benefit from weaker ties can be extended to social capital as well.

The modified homophily principle suggests that dissimilarity of resources is related to less interaction and less sentiment (Figure 3.1). Thus, weaker ties characterized by less intimacy, less intensity, less frequent contact, fewer obligations, and weaker reciprocal services should also be associated with more dissimilar resources. As reflected in Figure 5.4, as ego reaches out for ties with weaker relations, the hypothesis on the strength of weaker ties suggests that ego would reach either toward the upper end (alter 2) or the lower end (alter 3) of the hierarchical structure. Weaker ties therefore allow access to wider resource heterogeneity. Thus, the mation between the two groups. For several decades after the advent of social psychology in the 1920s and 1930s, the homophily principle in fact led much theoretical and research development by focusing on the strongly connected groups (e.g., primary groups, reference groups, small groups, and intimate relations) under the premise that stronger ties promote cohesion, satisfaction, and congruence of attitudes and opinions.

These attributes were seen as desirable in sustaining members’ relations as well as the group. That is, the focus was on the strength of strong ties. This development largely ignored bridges or weak ties because they were seen as the opposite of the strong ties that had all the positive features of social groups.

Granovetter’s strength-of-weak-ties argument pointed out how weak ties might contribute to information flow. Through this bridge, and perhaps only through this bridge, a member in one group may learn and gain information about the other group. If that information is useful, then whoever has access to the bridge and uses it will gain an advantage over another member of the same group. Presumably the group also benefits from the information regarding the other group flowing through the bridge, even though this was not pointed out in Granovetter’s original statements (1973, 1974).

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  69

modified strength-of-weak-ties proposition states that   the weaker the tie,   the more likely ego will have access to heterogeneous resources .

However, the weak-tie argument itself does not suggest that weaker ties will always link ego to better resources (upper reachability [alter 2

rather than alter 3] and extensity). After all, resource heterogeneity is only one criterion of better social capital (e.g., new and different information added to ego’s repertoire of information). More critically, we need to modify the original strength-of-weak-tie hypothesis further in order to link it to the upper-reachability criterion for accessing social capital. Here we can employ an extension of the homophily principle.

Empirical observations (Laumann 1966) suggest that individuals prefer to associate with others of somewhat higher social status.

Laumann calls this the   prestige principle . Preference in association, of course, is different from actual behavior in interactions, but it does explain why empirical evidence shows that individuals tend to pursue interaction with others of similar or slightly higher, rather than lower, socioeconomic status.5 That is, given a choice between alter 2 and alter 3 in Figure 5.4, ego will tend to prefer interacting with alter 2. Thus, we may further modify the strength-of-weak-ties proposition as follows:   the   weaker the tie, the more likely ego will have access to better social capital   (at least in terms of resource heterogeneity and upper reachability) .

The strength-of-weak-ties argument is now clear. The remaining issue is whether it is necessary to have the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis in order to understand the advantage of network locations in getting access to social capital. To explore this question, we will now examine an alternative conceptualization.

(5) The Strength-of-Location Proposition: The closer individuals are to   a bridge in a network, the better social capital they will access for instrumental action.   Granovetter’s discussion of the「bridge in the network」

(1973) pointed to the utility of network locations in allowing information to flow from one social circle to another. It led to his formulation of the strength-of-weak-ties argument. However, he then shifted the argument from a focus on network location to one on social ties. The advantage was that the strength of ties, as measured by intimacy, intensity, frequency of contacts, and reciprocal services – especially other surrogate measures, such as role relationships (e.g., kin, friend, acquaintance) – could be readily studied in sample surveys, since such measures 5 In actual behavior, individuals do interact with others of lower socioeconomic status.

This is a given, because even when individuals interact with preferred others (those of higher status), these others are interacting with lower-status egos. What, then, is the motive for individuals to maintain interactions with lower-status others? One perspective on this topic will be discussed in Chapter 9.

Theory and Research

could readily be assessed from respondents’ self-reports. It would have been much more difficult to gather data on how individuals form ties in social networks. The problem is whether such measures, or even the notion of the strength of ties, captures the significance of network locations such as bridges.

A    social bridge   may be defined as a linkage between two individual actors in a social network, the absence of which would cause the breakup of a cluster into two separate clusters, each of which has two or more individual actors. In other words, a bridge is the sole link between two groups of actors. This definition can be relaxed somewhat in that two clusters may be linked through several bridges. Bridges serve the important function of making possible access to resources embedded in both groups.

The notion of a bridge is more explicitly explored by Burt (1992) in his theory of the   structural hole , defined as「the separation between nonredundant contacts」and a「relationship of nonredundancy between two contacts.」Burt further specifies that「the hole is a buffer, like an insulator in an electric circuit. As a result of the hole between them, the two contacts provide network benefits that are in some degree additive rather than overlapping」(Burt 1992, p. 18). An example of structural holes is provided in Figure 5.5. Three holes are represented here: between the cluster of ties around A and those around ego (「you」) cluster, between ego’s cluster and the cluster around B, and between A’s cluster and B’s cluster. While the structural hole indicates nonredundancies or near emptiness of linkages between clusters, the connections, if they do Figure 5.5 Structural holes (bridges) and strength of ties (horizontal clusters).

exist, between ego and A, ego and B, and A and B constitute bridges.

The concept of structural holes focuses on the lack of access between clusters, while bridges emphasize access between clusters over the (nearly empty) holes. Thus, structural holes and bridges are two ways of describing similar network features and the strategic importance of certain locations.

Bridges allow individual actors in one cluster to have access to resources embedded in nodes in another cluster that otherwise would not be accessible. Burt argues that the benefit of bridges over structural holes is that they control the flow of information, very similar to Granovetter’s argument. With no loss of generality, we may extend the benefit to include access to all social capital. Thus, this argument can be stated as the strength-of-location hypothesis:   the closer individuals are   to a bridge in a network, the better the social capital to which they will   have access .

The strength-of-weak-tie argument can then be conceived as a surrogate proposition for the strength-of-location proposition. Since bridges tend to represent weak links between two clusters, using a weaker tie increases one’s likelihood of gaining access to a bridge. This surrogate proposition is useful when it is difficult to rely on ego’s cognition for complete mapping of a network. Rather than probing for all possible bridges in ego’s network, ego’s decision strategy can be simplified by looking for ego’s weaker ties. This surrogate argument also simplifies the researcher’s task. Rather than mapping an entire network for each ego, the researcher can use measures of the strength of ties instead. Of course, since this is a surrogate measure, evidence from research that tests the strength-of-location proposition may be weakened.

(6) The Location-by-Position Proposition: The strength of a location (in   proximity to a bridge), for instrumental action, is contingent on the   resource differential across the bridge.   While the structural hole perspective shifts the formulation of social bridges from Granovetter’s focus on the strength of ties to network locations, it also needs modification.

Considering the vertical axis in Figure 5.6 as the hierarchy of a structure; then it is clear that ego’s (「your」) connection to A will be much more beneficial to members of ego’s group than ego’s connection to B, since A’s cluster consists of positions richer in resources compared to those in ego’s cluster, and B’s cluster consists of poorer positions. This situation is a sharp contrast to the situation in Figure 5.5, where the three clusters are「flattened」to the same level in the hierarchy. The three structural holes and bridges remain the same as in Figure 5.6, but the relative benefit of resources accessed through the three bridges is minimal.

72

Theory and Research

Figure 5.6 Differential advantages of structural holes (bridges) and weaker ties in a hierarchical structure.

Thus, the benefit of a strategic location such as the bridge in a social network depends on the resources accessed. Location near a bridge may not be very useful if the bridge simply leads to nodes that have similar or less highly valued resources. In other words, the relative advantage of proximity to a bridge in a network is contingent on the relative resourcefulness of the nodes to which that bridge provides access. This can be stated as an interaction proposition:   the strength of a location (in proximity to a bridge) is contingent on the resource differential across the   bridge .

Since differential resources among individual actors are best represented by their positions in the hierarchy, we can further specify this interactive proposition:   access to better social capital tends to occur for   an individual actor who occupies a location closer to a bridge that links   the actor to those in relatively higher hierarchical positions . Thus, locational advantage is contingent on the resources of the accessible network.

Since it is assumed here that better resources are embedded, by definition, in higher positions in a hierarchical structure, this means that the locational advantage in a network is contingent on the vertical extent of its accessible positions.

This location-by-position proposition does not entirely negate the significance of vertical bridges to lower as well as upper clusters. As seen in Figure 5.6, having bridges from ego to both A’s and B’s clusters increases resource heterogeneity for members in ego’s cluster. However, since the strength-of-position proposition involves resource heterogeneity (the higher positions also have a greater vertical range in the resources accessible through their ties and networks) as well as upper reachability,

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  73

we expect B to maintain the connection with ego so that it expands the heterogeneity of resources for members in B’s cluster to ego’s cluster and A’s cluster.

In summary, the significance of network locations, whether conceived as bridges or as tie strengths, is contingent on the relative hierarchical structural positions of the individuals thus bridged or linked. The relative advantage of having bridges or weaker ties is a function of the relative vertical distance between ties or clusters of ties.6

Structural Contingency of Action Effects

The propositions just presented, especially the factors leading to better social capital, have identified two effects: effects due to positions of origin in the structure and effects due to networking (ties and locations) and their joint effects. While the strength-of-position proposition clearly reflects structural effects, the networking propositions reflect a mixture of opportunity and choice. Whether and to what extent opportunity and choice reflect purposive actions deserves some further consideration.

Both the strength-of-weak-tie argument and the strength-of-location argument, as discussed in Chapter 4, represent opportunity and choice, thus implicating action. However, there is little doubt that structure places constraints on opportunity and choice. Consider the strength-of-weak-tie argument. Toward the top of the hierarchical structure (see Figure 5.3), the vertical reach toward the upper ceiling is increasingly reduced. Thus, the likelihood of reaching up, as compared to reaching down, is decreased when the vertical link (weaker ties) is evoked. In fact, at the very top, any vertical link would be a downward link. Thus, stronger ties (horizontal ties) rather than weaker ties (vertical ties) should be more effective in accessing better social capital. In other words, as one’s position in the hierarchical structure moves toward the upper ceiling, the homophily principle rather than the heterophilous principle becomes more effective.

At the same time, the strength-of-networking effect may also be constrained from below. At the low end of the hierarchy, as postulated, there will be more positions as well as more occupants. According to the structural theory postulated by Blau (1977), the probability of interaction is a function of group size. Thus, as the size of the population of positions and occupants increases, there is a greater likelihood of interaction 6 Note that we do not postulate that the volume of the network, as reflected in the number of individual actors, is a determinant of better social capital. There is no theoretical reason to speculate that better social positions, resource-rich networks, or heterogeneous networks should be associated with a structure or network with a larger population.

74

Theory and Research

among themselves if everyone is assumed to have the same propensity for interaction. Then it is conceivable that the social network becomes more homogeneous and less diverse as the size of the group increases. A derived hypothesis is that at the low end of the social hierarchy, the more homogeneous network increases the chances for interacting with strong ties and decreases the chances for interacting with weak ties. A conjecture can therefore be that the lack of the opportunity structure reduces the effect of networking as a way of accessing better social capital.

It is in the middle range of the hierarchical structure, therefore, that we should expect to detect the strength of networking effects. As the relative sizes of contiguous social positions are similar and the opportunity structure is extensive, the vertical reach should have the best probability of reaching upward. If this proposition is valid, we are also therefore predicting that action is most meaningful and effective when ego’s position is in the middle range of the hierarchical structure. Actors at the lower level of the structure have little opportunity to exert meaningful actions. Similarly, but for different reasons, actors at the upper echelons have less incentive to take actions that would disrupt the structural effect (i.e., rocking the boat). This leads to the following proposition.

(7) The Structural Contingency Proposition: Networking (tie and location) effects are constrained by the hierarchical structure for actors   located near or at the top and bottom of the hierarchy.   Figure 5.7 illustrates this interaction between structure and action. Ego 1, near the upper ceiling, is shown to have limited opportunity to reach upward if Figure 5.7 Structural constraints on networking effects.

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  75

he or she chooses vertical access. Ego 3, near the lower ceiling, is structurally constrained in opportunities to access vertically in either direction. Ego 2, somewhere in the middle range of the hierarchy, should have the advantages of both extensive upper reaches and opportunities to achieve such access.

Concluding Remarks

We now summarize the major points in the theory of social capital as a set of postulates (untested assumptions) and propositions as follows: 1. The structural postulate (Chapter 3): valued resources are embedded in social structures in which positions, authority, rules, and occupants (agents) usually form pyramidal hierarchies in terms of the distribution of valued resources, number of positions, level of authority, and number of occupants. The higher the level in the hierarchy, the greater the concentration of valued resources, the fewer the number of positions, the greater the command of authority, and the smaller the number of occupants.

2. The interaction postulate (Chapters 3 and 4): interactions usually occur among actors with similar or contiguous characteristics of resources and lifestyles – following the homophily principle. The greater the similarity of resource characteristics, the less effort required in interaction.

3. The network postulate (Chapters 3 and 4): in social networks, directly and indirectly interacting actors carry varying types of resources. Some of these resources are in their personal possession (personal resources or human capital), but most of the resources are embedded in others with whom each actor is in contact, directly or indirectly, or they are embedded in structural positions each actor occupies or is in contact with.

4. The definition (Chapters 2–4): these structurally embedded resources are   social capital   for the actors in the networks.

5. The action postulates (Chapter 4): actors are motivated to either maintain or gain their resources in social actions –

purposive actions. Action to maintain resources can be called expressive action, and action to gain resources can be called instrumental action. Maintaining resources is the primary motivation for action; therefore, expressive action is the primary form of action.

6. The social-capital proposition:   the success of action is positively   associated with social capital .

76

Figure 5.8 Model of the social capital theory.

7. The strength-of-position proposition:   the better the position of   origin, the more likely the actor will access and use better social   capital .

8. The strength-of-strong-tie proposition:   the stronger the tie, the   more likely the social capital accessed will positively affect the   success of expressive action .

9. The strength-of-weak-tie proposition:   the weaker the tie, the   more likely ego will have access to better social capital for instrumental action .

10. The strength-of-location proposition:   the closer individuals are   to a bridge in a network, the better social capital they will access   for instrumental action .

11. The location-by-position proposition:   the strength of a location   (in proximity to a bridge) for instrumental action is contingent   on the resource differential across the bridge .

12. The structural contingency proposition:   the networking (tie and   location) effects are constrained by the hierarchical structure for   actors located near or at the top and bottom of the hierarchy .

A model based on these propositions is depicted in Figure 5.8.

These postulates and propositions have made it explicit that the proposed theory of social capital has four characteristics: (1) Its concepts are   relational   in nature and cannot be reduced to the individualistic or psychological level. (2) The theory is intrinsically interwoven within   a   hierarchical structure . In fact, it attains meaning only in the context of a hierarchical structure. (3) It entails   actions   on the part of the individuals, thus requiring a micro-level analysis. (4) Its development has been based on close reciprocal integration of   theorizing and empirical

Theory and Theoretical Propositions  77

research , thus avoiding pitfalls of infinite abstract-to-abstract deductions from assumed theories or mindless empiricism. These characteristics, I argue, place it in a unique position to address the macro–micro gap and development in sociology.

Finally, we should note that assumptions are made only to allow the theoretical propositions to be specified. Thus, assumptions may be exogenous (given) to the explication of a theory, but there is no guarantee that they are empirically valid. Theoretical development anticipates research not only on the validity of the propositions, but on the validity of the assumptions as well. That is, it is anticipated that when instruments become available, the assumptions themselves must be subject to research and empirical examination. There is nothing sacred about the assumptions. The theory itself is subjected to modification or even refutation when assumptions are invalidated. Theory guides research, and it must continuously be subjected to verification and possible modifications.

Social Capital and Status Attainment

A Research Tradition

This chapter1 presents a research tradition reflecting the proposed linkage between social capital and instrumental action. Specifically, it investigates how social capital enhances the likelihood of getting better jobs. It thus falls within the general research paradigm known as the   status attainment process .

Status attainment can be understood as a process by which individuals mobilize and invest resources for returns in socioeconomic standing.

The theoretical and empirical work for understanding and assessing the status attainment process can be traced to the seminal study reported by Blau and Duncan (1967). The major conclusion was that even accounting for both the direct and indirect effects of ascribed status (parental status), achieved status (education and prior occupational status) remains the most important factor accounting for the individual’s ultimate attained status. The study thus set the theoretical baseline for further modifications and expansions. All subsequent theoretical revisions and expansions must be evaluated for their contribution to the explanation of status attainment beyond those accounted for by the Blau–Duncan paradigm (Kelley 1990; Smith 1990). Several later lines of work, including the addition of sociopsychological variables (Sewell and Hauser 1975), the recasting of statuses as classes (Wright 1979; Goldthorpe 1980), the incorporation of「structural」entities and positions as both contributing and attained statuses (Baron and Bielby 1980; Kalleberg 1988), and the identification of comparative development or institutions as contingent conditions (Treiman 1970) have significantly amplified rather than altered the original Blau–Duncan conclusion concerning the relative merits of achieved versus ascribed   personal resources  in status attainment.

Social Capital and Status Attainment  79

In the last three decades, a research tradition has focused on the effects of social capital on attained statuses. The principal proposition is that social capital exerts an important and significant effect beyond that accounted for by personal resources. Systematic investigations of this proposition have included (1) developing theoretical explanations and hypotheses; (2) developing measurements for social capital; (3) conducting empirical studies verifying the hypotheses; and (4) assessing the relative importance of social resources compared to personal resources in the process of status attainment. These investigations have been carried out in North America, Europe, and Asia, in multiple political economies, and have involved scholars of many nations and cultures.

The accumulation of and advances in theory and research have considerably expanded the intellectual horizon of sociological analysis in status attainment, and thus in social stratification and social mobility. It probably also represents the most prominent research area where explicit, systematic application and analysis of the theory and methods of social capital for instrumental actions has occurred. To a great extent, this research tradition has directly contributed to the development of the theory of social capital itself.

The purposes of this chapter are to (1) review the theoretical and empirical foundations of these lines of investigation; (2) summarize sampled studies and results; and (3) propose issues and directions for future research. Before proceeding with these tasks, I wish to identify the limitations of this review. It will focus on social capital – embedded resources in the networks accessed and used to attain statuses; as such, it does not review the effects of properties of social networks per se (e.g., density, centrality, bridging) unless they implicate accessed resources (what influence these characteristics may exert on the access and use of embedded resources). Second, the outcome of this focus is the status attained rather than whether a job search is successful. The latter has a substantial literature of its own and is better summarized elsewhere (e.g., Granovetter 1995). This chapter will touch on aspects of job searches to the extent that they affect attained statuses. Finally, only the literature available in English will be reviewed. I am aware of an expanding literature in Europe, but unfortunately, my language limitations do not allow for coverage here.

Formative Studies and Theoretical Foundations Contributions of social network analysis to status attainment can be traced to the seminal study conducted by Mark Granovetter (1974), who interviewed 282 professional and managerial men in Newton,

80

Theory and Research

Massachusetts. The data suggested that those who used interpersonal channels seemed to land more satisfactory and better (e.g., higher-paid) jobs. Based on this empirical research and substantiated by a review of job-search studies, Granovetter proposed (1973) a network theory for information flow. The hypothesis of the strength of weak ties states that weaker ties tend to form bridges that link individuals to other social circles for information not likely to be available in their own circles, and such information should be useful to the individuals.2

However, Granovetter never suggests that access to or help from weaker rather than stronger ties would result in higher-status jobs thus obtained (1995, p. 148). Clues about the linkage between strength of ties and attained statuses came indirectly from a small world study conducted in a tri-city metropolitan area in upstate New York (Lin, Dayton, and Greenwald 1978). The task of the participants in the study was to forward packets containing information about certain target persons to others they knew on a first-name basis so that the packets might eventually reach the target persons. The study found that successful chains (those packets successfully forwarded to the targets) involved higher-status intermediaries until the last nodes (dipping down in the hierarchy toward the locations of the targets) compared to the unsuccessful chains.

Successful chains also implicated nodes that had more extensive social contacts (who claimed more social ties) and yet tended to forward the packets to someone they had not seen recently (weaker ties). The small world study thus made two contributions. First, it suggested that access to hierarchical positions might be the critical factor in the process of status attainment. Thus, the possible linkage between strength of ties and status attainment might be indirect: the strength of weak ties might lie in their accessing social positions higher in the social hierarchy, which have the advantage in facilitating instrumental action. Second, the study implicated behavior rather than a paper-and-pencil exercise, as each step in the packet-forwarding process required actual actions from each participant. Thus, the study results lend behavioral validity to the results of previous status attainment paper-and-pencil studies.

Based on these studies, a theory of social resources has emerged (Lin 1982, 1990). The theory begins with an image of the macrosocial structure consisting of positions ranked according to certain normatively 2 On the surface, this hypothesis might be seen as simply the inverse of the long-known hypothesis that stronger ties are formed among those who share similar characteristics and lifestyles, known as the homophily principle or the like-me hypothesis (Homans 1950; Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954; Laumann 1966; Lin 1982). What the strength-of-weak-ties argument contributed, however, was a challenge to the taken-for-granted and attributed value given to strong ties, or the homophily principle: strong ties, which promote group solidarity, are socially valuable. By shifting our attention to the weaker ties, Granovetter alerted us that weak ties, which promote access to different and new information, are socially valuable as well.

Social Capital and Status Attainment  81

valued resources such as wealth, status, and power. This structure has a pyramidal shape in terms of accessibility and control of such resources: the higher the position, the fewer the occupants; and the higher the position, the better the view it has of the structure (especially down below).

The pyramidal structure suggests advantages for positions closer to the top, in terms of both number of occupants (fewer) and accessibility to positions (more). Within these structural constraints and opportunities, individuals act for expressive and instrumental purposes. For the latter (attaining status in the social structure being one prime example), the better strategy would be for ego to reach toward contacts higher up in the hierarchy. These contacts would be better able to exert influence on positions (e.g., a recruiter for a firm) whose actions might benefit ego’s interest. This reaching-up process might be facilitated if ego uses weaker ties, since these are more likely to reach out vertically (presumably upward) rather than horizontally relative to ego’s position in the hierarchy.

Three propositions have thus been formulated: (1) the social-resources proposition – social resources (e.g., resources accessed in social networks) exert influence on the outcome of an instrumental action (e.g., attained status), (2) the strength-of-position proposition – social resources, in turn, are affected by the original position of ego (as represented by parental resources or previous resources), and (3) the strength-of-ties proposition – social resources are also affected by the use of weaker rather than stronger ties.

Social Resources and Social Capital:

A Theoretical Convergence

This theoretical development occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when parallel but independent discussions on social capital (Bourdieu 1980, 1983/1986; Coleman 1988) were emerging as well. While social capital refers to a variety of features in the social structure, according to different scholars (e.g., community norms – Coleman 1990; group solidarity – Hechter 1983, Portes and Sensenbrenner 1993; participation in voluntary and civil organizations – Putnam 1995a, 1995b), it eventually became clear (Lin 1982, 1995a; Flap 1996; Tardos 1996; Burt 1997; Portes 1998) that social capital refers primarily to resources accessed in social networks. Further, the theory also focuses on the instrumental utility of such resources (capital as investment or mobilization). The convergence of the social resources and social capital theories complements and strengthens the development of a social theory focusing on the instrumental utility of accessed and mobilized resources embedded in social networks. It places the significance of social resources

82

Theory and Research

in the broader theoretical discussion of social capital and sharpens the definition and operationality of social capital as a research concept. The three propositions previously stated (i.e., social capital, strength of position, and strength of ties) remain valid in the framework of social capital, although other propositions have subsequently been proposed (see Chapter 5). The following discussion will reflect the merged notions of social capital and social resources and will examine the research conducted on the three propositions: (1) the social-capital proposition (Proposition 1 in Chapter 5): better embedded resources accessed in the social networks lead to better attained status; (2) the strength-of-position proposition (Proposition 2 in Chapter 5): the better the structural position of origin, the better the attained status; and (3) the strength-of-weak-ties proposition (Proposition 4 in Chapter 5): the weaker the ties, the better the attained status (in the instrumental action of a job search). At the empirical and research levels, social resources are used; at the general theoretical level, social capital is employed.

Research Models and Evidence

Research on the relationships between social resources and status attainment examines two processes, as illustrated in Figure 6.1. One process focuses on the access to social capital – resources accessed in the ego’s general social networks. In this process, human capital (education, experiences), initial positions (parental or prior job statuses), and ego’s social ties (e.g., extensity of ties) are hypothesized to determine the extent of resources the ego can access through such connections (network resources). Further, network resources, education, and initial positions are expected to affect attained statuses such as occupational status, authority positions, sectors, or earnings. We may describe this model as the   accessed social capital model .

Another process focuses on the mobilization of social capital in the process of status attainment – the use of social contacts and the resources provided by the contact in the job-search process. As can be seen in Figure 6.1, contact status used is seen as the mobilized social capital in the status attainment process. It is hypothesized that contact status, along with education and initial positions, will exert a significant and important effect on the status of the job obtained. Contact status, in turn, is affected by education, network resources, and the tie strength between ego and the contact. Strength of ties may be measured either with a perceived strength (e.g., intimacy of the relationship) or with a role category (e.g., kin, friends, and acquaintances). We shall call this model the  mobilized social capital model .

In both types of analysis, other factors may be added to the basic model, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, indications of job experience or tenure, the work sector, and the industry or organization, either as control variables or as opportunity/constraint factors. We turn now to a brief review of the literature, which will proceed first with the mobilized social capital model, as it received initial research attention, followed by the accessed social capital model and models incorporating both access and mobilization processes. A summary of the studies and findings appears in Table 6.1.

Social Capital and Status Attainment  85

Lin, Vaughn, and Ensel 1981). The study used data from a representative community sample in metropolitan Albany, New York, of more than 400 employed men, and confirmed that contact status exerted effects on attained status beyond and after accounting for parental status and education effects. It also confirmed that contact status was affected positively by the father’s status and negatively by the strength of ties between ego and the contact. The results provided the initial confirmation of all three propositions of the social capital theory. Ensel (1979) extended the investigation to both men and women in a study of employed adults in New York State. While confirming that contact status significantly affected attained status, he found that male contacts were much more likely to reach higher-status contacts than female contacts. Further, women were more likely to use female contacts in job searches, while men overwhelmingly used male contacts. When women did use male contacts, their disadvantage in reaching higher-status contacts as compared to men was significantly reduced. This study was one of the first to provide direct evidence that men, being positioned advantageously in the hierarchy, had better social capital than women. Secondly, women’s disadvantages in mobilizing male contacts, and thereby accessing better social capital, accounted in part for their inferior status attainment.

Further replication and extension of the model were done by Marsden and Hurlbert (1988), who analyzed the transition to current jobs for 456 men in the 1970 Detroit Area Study. This confirmed that contact status (occupational prestige and sector) exerted the strongest effects on attained prestige and sector, respectively. The authors also found that the contact’s prestige and position in the core sector were related to the prestige and sector of the prior job, respectively, confirming the strength-of-position proposition. On the other hand, the authors did not confirm the strength-of-tie proposition; contact status was not associated with the strength of ties between ego and the contact.

Extension of the model to other societies quickly followed. De Graaf and Flap (1988) lent further support to the social resources proposition in their analyses of 628 males in a 1980 West German survey and 466

males in a 1982 Dutch survey. They did not examine the strength-of-position or the strength-of-tie propositions for social resources. The Netherlands Family Survey of 1992 provided data on male–female com-anywhere from 20 percent to over 61 percent of the job seekers indicate the use of personal contacts (for a summary, see Granovetter 1995, pp. 139–141). Yet, studies of selectivity bias have revealed no major differences in the characteristics of those who used personal contacts compared to those who used formal channels or direct applications in job searches. Younger and less experienced workers do show a slightly greater tendency to use personal contacts. Thus, most studies have incorporated age and/or work experience as controls to account for possible bias.

parisons in the social capital effect. Moerbeek, Ultee, and Flap (1995) used father’s occupation as the indicator of social capital when the father was mentioned as the social contact, and found that it exerted a positive and significant effect on the statuses of first and current/last jobs for both men and women. Wegener (1991) analyzed a 1987 data set from Germany of 604 men and women aged forty-two and thirty-two, and found that contact status significantly affected the prestige of the job found, confirming the social resources proposition. However, the strength-of-ties proposition and the strength-of-position hypotheses were not examined. Barbieri (1996), reporting a study of 500 newly hired persons in the administrative area of Milan, Italy, confirmed the social-resources proposition by finding that contact status significantly affected present job status, having already accounted for effects from father’s status, education, and first and previous job statuses. Further, he found that father’s status indirectly affected contact status through education, lending some support to the strength-of-tie proposition. When Barbieri subdivided the sample into those who used strong versus weak ties, he found no advantage of using weaker ties in the association between contact status and attainted status. In fact, there was some evidence that stronger ties increased the association between contact status and statuses of first and previous jobs. Requena’s (1991) study in Spain provided the only disconfirming evidence for the social resources proposition, as it showed that greater social resources did not provide better jobs, even though they did affect income attainment. He speculated that the lack of social-resources effects was due in part to the rigid bureau-cratization of Spain’s employment policies and practices.

Systematic tests of the theory have been carried out in Asia as well. A series of studies were conducted by Hsung and others in Taiwan, which is also a capitalist state. One study (Hsung and Sun 1988) surveyed the labor force in the manufacturing industry, and another (Hsung and Hwang 1992) examined the labor force in a metropolitan area (Taichung). Both studies supported the social resources proposition that contact status significantly affects the status of obtained first and current jobs after accounting for father’s education and occupational status, education, and, in the case of the current job, prior job status. Hsung and Hwang (1992) also found modest support for the strength-of-position argument, but father’s education and occupational status had only a modest effect on contact status for the first job and no significant effects on the current job’s contact status. For strength of ties, a composite measure (closeness with contacts, frequency of visits, frequency of calls, and content of the relationship) indicated only a slightly negative relationship with the first job’s contact status and no relationship with the current job’s contact status. In addition, in 1994, Bian and Ang (1997)

Social Capital and Status Attainment  87

conducted a study of 512 men and women in Singapore that strongly confirmed the social resources proposition: contact status significantly affected obtained status. Helper status was strongly related to the current job’s occupational status, along with age, education, and prior job status.

For all respondents, weaker ties reached higher-status contacts. However, the weakest ties (not intimate at all) had no effect on contact status, a finding similar to that of a 1988 Tianjin study that will be described shortly. For those who reached helpers indirectly, the association between tie strength and contact status was negative. However, stronger ties between the intermediary and the helper were more likely to result in reaching a higher-status helper.

A major extension of the research paradigm has examined the propositions in different political economies, such as state socialism. Bian (1997), in a 1988 study conducted in Tianjin, China, including 1,008

men and women, found that helper’s job status (measured by the hierarchical level of his or her work unit) was strongly associated with attained work unit status in the job change, along with education and prior job status. The overall effect of the tie strength between ego and the helper on the helper’s status was insignificant. Further analyses showed that medium-strength ties reached helpers with better status; this was true for the tie strength between ego and intermediaries, as well as between intermediaries and helpers. Moreover, in a retrospective panel study conducted by Volker and Flap (1999) in Leipzig and Dresden, two cities in the former German Democratic Republic, the occupational prestige of the contact person had strong and significant effects on both the first job and job prestige in 1989. Thus, the social resources proposition was confirmed. However, strength of ties (measured by the intensity of the relationship between ego and the contact) had no effect on contact statuses or on attained occupational status and income. Neither father’s education nor occupational prestige affected contact status for the 1989

job search. However, education had a significant effect on contact status.

Since the father’s status had direct effects on education, these results confirmed the indirect effect of the strength of positions, mediated through education.

Accessed Social Capital

Two methods are used to measure accessed social capital: name generators and position generators. The   name generator   method is the more common method and has been used extensively in the network literature. The general technique is to pose one or more questions about ego’s contacts in certain role relationships (e.g., neighborhood, work), content areas (e.g., work matters, household chores), or intimacy (e.g., confi-

dential, most intimate interactions). Such questions generate a list of contacts ranging from three to five or as many as volunteered by ego. From these lists, relationships between ego and contacts, and among contacts, as well as contacts’ characteristics, are generated. Social capital measures are constructed to reflect the contacts’ diversity and range of resources (education, occupation) as well as characteristics (gender, race, age).

There are a number of problems associated with the use of name generators to measure social capital, including variations in distributions being affected by the content or role and number of names. As a result, the data tend to reflect stronger ties, stronger role relations, or geographically limited ties (Campbell and Lee 1991).

Position generators , first proposed by Lin and associates (Lin and Dumin 1986), use a sample of structural positions that are salient in a society (occupations, authorities, work units, class, or sector) and ask respondents to indicate contacts (e.g., those known on a first-name basis), if any, in each of the positions. In addition, relationships between ego and the contact for each position can be identified. Thus, instead of sampling content or role areas, the position generator samples hierarchical positions. It is content free and role/location neutral. Instead of counting and measuring data from specific names (persons) generated, the position generator counts and measures access to structural positions.

An example of the position-generator instrument is shown in Table 6.2.

The name-generator methodology has been employed in research over a longer period of time, while the position-generator methodology has emerged in more recent studies. The following section will report on the studies and results for each methodology on accessed social capital and status attainment.

Social Capital and Status Attainment  89

Name-Generators Studies.   Campbell, Marsden, and Hurlbert (1986) examined the associations between network resources and socioeconomic statuses with name-generator data from the 1965–1966 Detroit Area Study and found that the resource compositions of networks (mean and maximal education, mean and maximal prestige) were significantly associated with attained statuses such as occupational prestige and family income. In the Milan study, Barbieri (1996) also constructed three measures for social capital from name-generator data and found them to affect present job status after accounting for parental statuses, experience, human capital (years of schooling), and first and previous job statuses. Further, social capital was affected by father’s status, confirming the strength-of-position proposition.

Several studies have assessed the associations between accessed social capital and attained statuses among certain labor populations. Access to social capital by the unemployed was the focus of a study conducted by Sprengers, Tazelaar, and Flap (1988). Among a group of 242 Dutch men aged forty to fifty-five who were unemployed in or before 1978, those with better social capital were more likely to find jobs within a year after unemployment, especially those with access to social capital through weak ties. Those with better social capital did not find a better occupational status or a higher income when they found reemployment.

However, better social capital increased optimism about job opportunities, which in turn increased the intensity of the job search, leading to more and better jobs. Further, it was found that the more restricted the labor market, the more intense those with greater social capital tended to be in job searches. After a year of unemployment, those with better social capital among strong ties (relatives) also tended to have a better chance of being rehired in the next one to three years. The study also found that those with better education, former occupations, and higher incomes also tended to have better social capital, confirming the strength-of-position hypothesis. Focusing on 1,359 top managers of large companies in the Netherlands, Boxman, De Graaf, and Flap (1991) found that both education and social capital (measured with work contacts in other organizations and membership in clubs and professional associations) had direct effects on income. The job-search activities of 365

persons in the Netherlands who finished vocational training were also studied by Boxman and Flap (1990) in 1989. Data were obtained from job seekers and employers, as well as from contacts used by the job seekers. Preliminary analyses showed that for income, the more important predictors were gender (in favor of men), social capital, career perspective, and company-specific skills.

Early promotion and better bonuses were the outcomes assessed by Burt (1992) for managers in a large electronic components and com-

puting equipment firm. Using the extent to which each ego was embedded in a constrained network (fewer contacts, more dense relations, and more contacts related to a single contact) as a measure of social capital, he found that there was a negative association between structural constraints and early promotion. That is, he suggested that access to diverse resources in one’s networks enhanced the opportunity to locate useful information and influence for promoting one’s position in the firm. For men in senior positions in the investment banking division of a large American financial organization, a similar negative association between constrained networks and bonuses was found (Burt 1997).

Position-Generators Studies.   Lin and Dumin (1986) analyzed the data from an Albany, New York, study in which twenty occupations were sampled from the U.S. 1960 census listing of occupations, with all occupations ranked according to job prestige scores. At equal intervals on the job prestige scale scores, occupations were identified. From this group, the most popular (frequency of occupants) occupation was selected. Each respondent was asked if he had any contact (person he knew on a first-name basis) in each of the positions. If more than one contact was indicated, the respondent was asked to focus on the most familiar one. For each accessed position, the respondent identified the contact’s relationship (relative, friend, or acquaintance). From the data matrix, Lin and Dumin constructed two social resources access measures: the highest status accessible (the position accessed with the highest prestige score) and the range of statuses accessed (the difference between the highest and lowest accessed statuses). Analyses showed that the two measures were positively and significantly related to current occupational status.

Further analysis showed that respondents’ original positions (father’s occupational prestige score or white–blue and high–low occupational groupings) and these two measures were positively and significantly related, confirming the strength-of-position hypothesis. When Lin and Dumin analyzed the relationships between the three types of ties (relatives, friends, acquaintances) and the access variables, they found that friends as well as acquaintances provided the best access to both the highest-status position and the range of accessed statuses.

Hsung and Hwang (1992) also incorporated network resources in their Taichung study, as cited earlier. Adapting the position-generator methodology with twenty occupations, they failed to find significant effects for the highest status accessed and for the difference between the lowest and highest occupational statuses accessed. However, they did find significant effects on the first job status of a measure of the「total amount of network resources,」which was based on the sum status scores of all occupations accessed. This measure, however, did not have any

Social Capital and Status Attainment  91

effect on current job status. Volker and Flap (1999), in their Germany study, used the position-generator methodology to ask respondents to identify, among thirty-three occupations, whether they knew anyone in any of the occupations, and if so, what their relationships were (relatives, friends, and acquaintances). For 1989 occupational status, the effect of the highest status accessed was positive and significant, controlling for fathers’ education and occupation, the respondents’ own education and sex, and the prestige of their first job. This variable also had a positive and moderately significant (  p  < .10) effect on 1989 income when 1989 occupational prestige was added to the equation along with all other independent variables. This result confirmed the social resources proposition. Further, Volker and Flap found that both relatives and acquaintances accessed better occupations (upper-white-collar or higher prestige) than friends. On the other hand, acquaintances accessed a greater range (the difference between the highest- and lowest-prestige jobs) of occupations than either relatives or friends. Since the highest occupational prestige accessed turned out to be the best predictor of attained status, the effects of weak ties were not found (as relatives and acquaintances were almost equally likely to access high-prestige occupations). The father’s occupational prestige was positively related to the highest occupational prestige accessed in general, as well as for each group of occupations accessed through relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Thus, the strength-of-position proposition was confirmed. In pre-1989 Hungary (1987–1988), Angelusz and Tardos (1991) also used the position generator to identify「weakly tied」relations or resources. This variable was found to be significantly associated with wages, after accounting for the effects of sex, education, residence, and age.

In her study of the private security industry (161 guard, investigation, and security companies) in Toronto in 1991–1992, Erickson (1995, 1996) used Wright’s (1979) class dimensions (control of property, control of organizations, and control of skill) to select nineteen job positions.

Data were gathered from 155 employees, 46 supervisors, 80 managers, and 112 owners. Erickson found that social capital (diversity in accessing various positions) contributed to job autonomy and authority, which in turn generated better job returns. The major conclusions are that (1) accessed social capital helps people to rise to higher positions (in comparisons between mangers versus lower-level employees and owners versus employees) and (2) social capital pays off even if people do not use a contact to get a job (see Recruitment and Social Capital in the next section). In another study on social capital, Erickson (1998) differentiated two types of social capital: global and local. Local settings refer to geographic areas (neighborhoods), ethnic areas (ethnic communities and enclave economies), or organizations (schools, voluntary organizations,

92

Theory and Research

social movements, or firms). In a telephone survey of 352 participants in the Toronto Local Employment and Trading System (LETS), Erickson asked the respondents to identify contacts in a list of thirty occupations both inside and outside the LETS system. Analyses showed that local social capital was associated with income in the LETS system (the local economy), while global social capital was not associated with income in the general economy, pointing to the fact that social capital’s effect is more contingent in the global economy system.

Joint Effects of Accessed and Mobilized Social Capital  Since there are two types of social capital in the process of status attainment, a logical step would be to examine accessed and mobilized social capital in a single study. The theoretical question posed is the extent to which accessed social capital facilitates social capital: that is, whether having more accessed social capital increases the likelihood of mobilizing better social capital. The structural opportunity and advantage implied in this hypothesis is apparent. However, it is also to be expected that the correspondence will not be overwhelming: not all persons accessed with rich social capital are expected to take advantage of or be able to mobilize social capital for the purpose of obtaining better socioeconomic status. An element of action and choice should also be significant. Several studies have lent support to this hypothesis.

For example, in their study of vocational training graduates, Boxman and Flap (Boxman 1992; Flap and Boxman 1996) showed that contact status (mobilized social capital) affects attained occupational status, whereas accessed social capital does not. The Germany study (Volker and Flap 1996) is another study in which both accessed and mobilized social capital were measured. It was found that the highest occupational prestige accessed using the position-generator methodology was significantly and positively related to the status of the contact person used in the 1989 job search, but its direct effect on 1989 job prestige, while positive, was only modest in significance (  p  < .10). The contact person’s prestige had a much stronger effect. In fact, its direct effect on 1989 job prestige was stronger than education once the prestige of the first job was also incorporated (and was the most significant predictor).

Lai, Lin, and Leung (1998) also examined the joint effects of accessed and mobilized social capital on status attainment using the Albany data (Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981). Incorporating both the network resources measures from the position generator (Lin and Dumin 1986) and the contact resources (contact status in the job search) in structural equation models, they showed that current job status is significantly and directly affected by education (achieved status) and by contact status.

Social Capital and Status Attainment  93

Contact status, in turn, is affected by parental statuses (ascribed status), education, network resources, and weaker ties with the contact. Thus, it is clear that mobilized social capital directly influences status outcome and mobilized social capital is affected by accessed social capital, along with ascribed and achieved statuses.

Issues and Research Directions

Research has provided consistent support for the proposition that social capital, in the form of social resources, makes a significant contribution to status attainment beyond personal resources. This association persists across societies (different nation-states and political economies), industrialization and development levels, labor market populations (recent graduates, new hires, job changers), different economic sectors (industries, organizations, positions in organizations), and status outcomes (occupation, authority, sector, promotion, bonuses). The association remains significant across differential conceptualization (accessed versus mobilized capital) and measurement (name generators versus position generators). Yet, there remain important issues to be conceptualized and studied in the future. In the following subsections, a number of these issues will be briefly identified and discussed.

Informal and Formal Job Search Channels

It is clear by now that the use of informal channels by itself offers no advantage over other channels, especially formal channels, in attained status. In fact, if anything, informal channels tend to be used by the disadvantaged: women, the less educated, and the less skilled. The statuses attained therefore tend to be lower. Yet, among those who use informal channels, social resources (contact statuses) make a major difference.

Several issues remain. First, is it really true that the advantaged do not need to use informal channels, as they possess greater human capital and can apply directly to high-status positions? The evidence is mixed. For some jobs that have specific requirements (dealing with technology and hardware, for example), credentials regarding skills and training in the formal application may be sufficient to obtain positions. However, for other critical jobs (high-level managerial and human-interfaced positions), formal credentials are often insufficient to convey the social skills and resources so essential for occupants’ performances. The necessary informal or shadow channels through which such information is conveyed, yet not detected in survey instruments, remain an important methodological challenge. Secondly, for the disadvantaged, social capital

94

Theory and Research

is restricted (the strength-of-position argument). Within this restricted range of resources, there is little information on whether the disadvantaged are also less likely to mobilize the optimal resources available to them, thus creating double jeopardy. Knowledge about the choice behaviors of the advantaged and the disadvantaged will be helpful in sorting through the structural constraints and choice constraints.

Strength of Ties or Network Locations?

While the social resources proposition and the strength-of-position propositions have been consistently confirmed (see Table 6.1), much ambiguity has resulted regarding the strength-of-ties proposition.

Strength of ties in and of itself should not be expected to exert a direct effect on status outcomes (Granovetter 1995), and much research evidence points to the absence of a direct association (e.g., Bridges and Villemez 1986; Marsden and Hurlbert 1988; Forse 1997). The modified proposition that weaker ties might access better social resources also lacks consistent empirical support (see Table 6.1). Yet, social capital is theorized to contain both structural effects and agency effects; further specifications of network or tie choices within structural constraints may eventually turn out to be meaningful. Several lines of investigation have provided some leads. For example, it has been argued that the effect of strength of ties on social resources accessed or mobilized may be contingent on the original status. Some studies have pointed to the ceiling effect of tie strength: at or near the top level of the hierarchy, it is strong ties that tend to yield successful job attainment (Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981; Erickson 1995, 1996). Also, the weakest ties are clearly not useful (Bian 1997; Bian and Ang 1997), since ties with no strength offer no incentive for exchanges. On the other hand, the strongest ties, by the same token, may be useful despite the restricted range of resources accessed. There ties, by definition, represent commitment, trust, and obligation and therefore the motivation to help. Willingness and effort to search for other ties using these strong ties may be critical under institutional uncertainties or constraints (e.g., under state socialism: Rus 1995, Bian 1997; or tight market situations: Sprengers, Tazelaar, and Flap 1988). Organizational constraints and opportunities may also condition the relative utility of weaker or stronger ties (Lin 1990).

Another source of possible clarification suggests a possible modification in the conceptualization of the strength of ties in network terms.

For example, strength of tie may be reflected in the length of the links between ego and the alter whose resources are eventually accessed. If each link is assumed to be of equal strength, then the strength of the tie between ego and the alter may become an inverse function of the length

Social Capital and Status Attainment  95

of the links between them: the longer the chain of connection, the weaker the tie. While the multiple links necessarily weaken the degree of obligations, trust, and reciprocity between ego and the ultimate alter, such a chain also extends the reach for resources not present in the proximal areas of ego in the networks. To the extent that heterogeneous or rich resources are present in distant parts of the network, the chain length or weaker ties may in fact become useful. Further analysis along this line (e.g., Bian 1997) will clarify the utility of both the bridge effect and the strength-of-tie effect.

Other considerations point to locations in the social networks. The utility of social ties may be more dependent on the locations of the actors in the social networks or on the hierarchical structure rather than the strength of ties (e.g., Lin and Dumin 1986; Angelusz and Tardos 1991; Burt 1997). Positions at or near strategic locations, such as bridges or structural holes, may provide a competitive advantage to actors accessing heterogeneous and thus rich resources.

These findings and considerations have led to further articulation of the propositions for the theory of social capital, as reflected in Chapter 5, where network positions, in conjunction with structural positions, provide the key to predict how likely an instrumental action is to lead to better social capital.

Further Development of the Position Generator  In order to ascertain the causal sequence, the time framework of the contacts needs to be specified. For example, the generator may wish to ask,

「When you were looking for the first (or current) job, did you know of anyone who had this kind of work?」Also, it is important to sample the positions from a meaningful hierarchy in a given society. In addition to occupational status or prestige, work units, sectors, authority, or autonomy may confer important statuses in certain societies. Catering to the significance of meaningful statuses/classes in a given society is thus an important consideration in identifying the positions in the generators (Erickson 1995).

Inequality of Social Capital

Differential access to social capital deserves much greater research attention. It is conceivable that social groups (gender, race) have different access to social capital because of their advantaged or disadvantaged structural positions and social networks. Thus, for example, inequality of social capital offers fewer opportunities for women and minorities to mobilize better social resources to attain and promote careers. For the

96

Theory and Research

disadvantaged to gain a better status, strategic behaviors require accessing resources beyond their usual social circles (e.g., women) using male ties (Ensel 1979) to find sponsors in the firm (Burt 1998) and to join clubs dominated by men (Beggs and Hurlbert 1997); or for blacks to find ties outside their own neighborhood or those employed (Green, Tigges, and Browne 1995); or for scholars of Mexican origin to find ties of non-Mexican origin or to establish ties with institutional agents such as teachers and counselors (Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch 1995; Stanton-Salazar 1997). Systematic data on inequalities in social capital will provide an explanatory framework for inequality in social stratification and mobility and offer behavioral choices to overcome such inequalities.

The next chapter, in fact, will describe one such effort.

Recruitment and Social Capital

The relationships between social capital and status attainment apply to both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. So far, research literature has primarily concentrated on the supply side – the status attainment process from job seekers’ perspective. The demand side of the model – the recruitment process from the organization’s perspective –

has only begun to emerge (Boxman and Flap 1990; Boxman, De Graaf and Flap 1991; Erickson 1995, 1996; Burt 1997; Fernandez and Weinberg 1997). There are reasons to believe that social capital is important for firms in selective recruitment, as firms must operate in an environment where social skills and networks play critical roles in transactions and exchanges. This is especially true of certain types of positions. Thus, we may anticipate that certain positions require more social capital than other positions in a firm. First, top-level executives are expected to possess rich social capital, as they need to deal with and manage people both within and outside the firm. In fact, we may postulate that at the highest level of management, social capital far outweighs human capital for occupants. Thus, it can be hypothesized that firms such as IBM and Microsoft are more likely to recruit experienced managers with social skills rather than computer expertise for their CEOs, and that top universities need presidents who have the social skills to negotiate with faculty, students, parents, and alumni, and to raise funds rather than produce distinguished scholarships. Second, we should expect positions that deal with persons (e.g., nurses) rather than machines or technologies (e.g., programmers) to be filled with occupants who have better social capital. Third, positions at the edge of the firm are more likely to be filled by those with better social capital than others (e.g., salesperson, public relations personnal, or managers at remote sites; Burt 1997).

Firms with more needs for such positions, therefore, should be expected

Social Capital and Status Attainment  97

to use informal sources in recruitment more extensively. Such hypotheses will help empirical specifications and testing.

Social Capital versus Human Capital

The relationship between social capital and human capital is theoretically important. Some scholars (Bourdieu 1983/1986; Coleman 1990) have proposed that social capital helps produce human capital. Well-connected parents and social ties can indeed enhance the opportunities for individuals to obtain better education, training, and skill and knowledge credentials. On the other hand, it is clear that human capital induces social capital. Better-educated and better-trained individuals tend to move in social circles and clubs rich in resources. The harder question is: given both, which is more important in enhancing status attainment?

Several studies cited in this chapter suggest that social capital may be as important as or even more important than human capital (education and work experience) in status attainment (Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981; Marsden and Hurlbert 1988), while others show the opposite (Hsung and Sun 1988; DeGraaf and Flap 1988; Hsung and Hwang 1992). Industrialization probably is not the explanation, as the former group includes studies conducted in the United States and the latter in the Netherlands and Taiwan. More likely, there is an association between specific educational institutions and methods of job allocations and searches. As Krymkowski (1991) showed in a comparative analysis of data from the United States, West Germany, and Poland in the 1970s, both West Germany and Poland showed stronger associations between social origins and education and between education and occupational allocations than the United States. Yet, there is no clear evidence that the educational system in Taiwan resembles the West German and Dutch systems more than it does the U.S. system. The contrasting results from these countries thus remain to be explained.

Still more intriguing are the possible interactions between human capital and social capital. Boxman, De Graaf, and Flap (1991) found that human capital had its greatest effect on income when social capital was low, and human capital had its least effect on income when social capital was high. Further, in the study of Dutch managers, Flap and Boxman (1998) found that for top managers, social capital led to higher income at all levels of human capital, but the returns on human capital decreased at higher levels of social capital. If these patterns can be confirmed, they would suggest that human capital supplements social capital in status attainment. That is, when social capital is high, attained status will be high, regardless of the level of human capital; and when social capital is low, human capital exerts a strong effect on attainment. Or,

98

Theory and Research

given certain minimal levels of human and social capital, social capital is the more important factor in accounting for status attainment.

Concluding Remarks

This brief chapter can only provide an abbreviated presentation of the rich and sizable research literature on social capital and status attainment. Many studies are currently being conducted in many parts of the world and have not been covered here. Nevertheless, it should be apparent that this research tradition has contributed significantly to the development of the social capital theory itself, as well as providing detailed and varied empirical data for its verification and continuous evolution.

The research enterprise truly exemplifies the importance and fruitfulness of the continuing interplay and reciprocal feedback between theory and research.
