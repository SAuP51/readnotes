Social Capital

Capital Captured through Social Relations  The premise behind the notion of social capital is rather simple and straightforward:   investment in social relations with expected returns in   the marketplace . This general definition is consistent with various renditions by all scholars who have contributed to the discussion (Bourdieu 1980, 1983/1986; Lin 1982, 1995a; Coleman 1988, 1990; Flap 1991, 1994; Burt 1992; Putnam 1993, 1995a; Erickson 1995, 1996; Portes 1998). The market chosen for analysis may be economic, political, labor, or community. Individuals engage in interactions and networking in order to produce profits. This represents a major extension of the capital theory in general and a significant expansion of the neo-capital theory. Both neo-capital theories discussed so far – human capital and cultural capital – see capital as an investment of personal resources for the production of profit; while they differ in terms of the nature of production (skills and knowledge versus values and norms) and profit (economic return for individuals versus reproduction of the dominant culture), they both address capital as resources invested and vested in individual actors. Capital is seen as the investment or production of individual actors, whether seen as independent, atomized elements randomly located in society, as in the case of human capital theory, or as individuals indoctrinated into adopting the dominant values, as in the case of cultural capital.

But this individual perspective has been expanded with a major advance in neo-capital theory, the notion of social capital – capital captured through social relations. In this approach, capital is seen as a social asset by virtue of actors’ connections and access to resources in the network or group of which they are members.

Why Does Social Capital Work?

Generally, four explanations can be offered as to why embedded resources in social networks enhance the outcomes of actions. For one, 19

the flow of   information   is facilitated  .   In the usual imperfect market situations, social ties located in certain strategic locations and/or hierarchical positions (and thus better informed on market needs and demands) can provide an individual with useful information about opportunities and choices otherwise not available. Likewise, these ties (or their ties) may alert an organization (be it in the production or consumption market) and its agents, or even a community, about the availability and interest of an otherwise unrecognized individual. Such information would reduce the transaction cost for the organization to recruit better (be it in skill, or technical or cultural knowledge) individuals, and for individuals to find better organizations that can use their capital and provide appropriate rewards. Second, these social ties may exert   influence   on the agents (e.g., recruiters or supervisors of the organizations) who play a critical role in decisions (e.g., hiring or promotion) involving the actor. Some social ties, due to their strategic locations (e.g., structural holes) and positions (e.g., authority or supervisory capacities), also carry more valued resources and exercise greater power (e.g., greater asymmetry in dependence by these agents) on organizational agents’

decision making. Thus,「putting in a word」carries a certain weight in the decision-making process regarding an individual. Third, social ties, and their acknowledged relationships to the individual, may be conceived by the organization or its agents as certifications of the individual’s  social credentials , some of which reflect the individual’s accessibility to resources through social networks and relations – his or her social capital.「Standing behind」the individual by these ties reassures the organization (and its agents) that the individual can provide added resources beyond the individual’s personal capital, some of which may be useful to the organization. Finally, social relations are expected to reinforce identity and recognition. Being assured of and recognized for one’s worthiness as an individual and a member of a social group sharing similar interests and resources not only provides emotional support but also public acknowledgment of one’s claim to certain resources. These   reinforcements   are essential for the maintenance of mental health and the entitlement to resources. These four elements –   information, influence,   social credentials,   and    reinforcement  – may explain why social capital works in instrumental and expressive actions not accounted for by forms of personal capital such as economic or human capital.1

1 Another element, control, has also been mentioned for the usefulness of social capital.

I consider control, reflecting both the network’s location and the hierarchical position, as central to the definition of social capital itself. Thus, information, influence, social credentials, and reinforcement are all reasons why social capital works or controls.

Differing Perspectives and

Converging Conceptualizations

Social capital has been a relatively recent development in theory and research. While earlier scholars (Loury 1977, 1987; Ben-Porath 1980) pointed to the phenomenon of resources or capital through social relations or even employed the term   social capital , only in the 1980s, when several sociologists, including Bourdieu, Coleman, and Lin, independently explored the concept in some detail, did it catch the attention of the research community.

Two perspectives can be identified relative to the level at which return or profit is conceived – whether the profit is accrued for the group or for the individual. In one perspective, the focus is on the use of social capital by individuals – how individuals access and use resources embedded in social networks to gain returns in instrumental actions (e.g., finding better jobs) or to preserve gains in expressive actions. Thus, at this relational level, social capital can be seen as similar to human capital in that it is assumed that such investments can be made by the individual with an expected return (some benefit or profit) to the individual. Aggregation of individual returns also benefits the collective. Nonetheless, the focal points for analysis in this perspective are (1) how individuals invest in social relations and (2) how individuals capture the embedded resources in the relations to generate a return.

Lin (1982), for example, argued that there are two types of resources an individual can gain access to and use: personal resources and social resources. Personal resources are resources possessed by an individual and may include ownership of material as well as symbolic goods (e.g., diplomas and degrees). Social resources are resources accessed through an individual’s social connections. Depending on the extensity and diversity of their social connections, individuals have differential social resources.

Further, these resources can be「borrowed」for the purpose of making a gain. A car borrowed from a friend to move household goods and a good word put in by an old classmate of one’s father for a job possibility are examples of the use of social resources. As will be made clear later in this volume, in both quantity and quality, social resources far outweigh personal resources in their potential usefulness to individuals.

For Flap (1988, 1991, 1994), social capital also includes mobilized social resources. Flap specifies three elements of social capital: (1) the number of persons within one’s social network who「are prepared or obliged to help you when called upon to do so,」(2) the strength of the relationship indicating readiness to help, and (3) the resources of these persons. Social capital, for Flap, is resources provided by alters who have

22

Theory and Research

strong relationships with ego. Thus, it is the product of availability of social resources and the propensity by alters to offer such resources for help.

Burt’s work (1992) also reflects this perspective. Network locations represent and create competitive advantages. Locations that link nodes and their occupants to information and other resources unlikely to be accessible otherwise constitute valuable capital for the occupants at these

「structural hole」positions, and at other locations and for other occupants accessing them.

Another perspective focuses on social capital at the group level, with discussions dwelling on (1) how certain groups develop and more or less maintain social capital as a collective asset and (2) how such a collective asset enhances group members’ life chances. Bourdieu (1980, 1983/1986) and Coleman (1988, 1990) have discussed this perspective extensively, and Putnam’s empirical work (1993, 1995a) is exemplary.

While acknowledging the essentiality of individuals interacting and networking in developing payoffs of social capital, the central interest of this perspective is to explore the elements and processes in the production and maintenance of the collective asset.

Bourdieu (1983/1986) sees capital in three guises: as economic capital, as cultural capital, and as social capital. For him, social capital is「made up of social obligations or connections.」It is the aggregation of「actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition – or in other words, to membership in a group」(p. 248).

The group provides its members with the collectivity-owned capital, which allows them credit. Capital, in this form, is represented by the size of the network and the volume of the capital (economic, cultural, or symbolic) possessed by those to whom a person is connected. In other words, for Bourdieu, social capital depends on the size of one’s connections and on the volume or amount of capital in these connections’ possession.

Nevertheless, social capital is a collective asset shared by members of a defined group, with clear boundaries, obligations of exchange, and mutual recognition.

Further, Bourdieu sees social capital as a production of the group’s members. It takes repeated exchanges that reinforce mutual recognition and boundaries to affirm and reaffirm the collectivity of the capital and each member’s claim to that capital. Finally, for Bourdieu, social capital is a mere disguise for economic capital. In the final analysis,「economic capital is at the root of all the other types of capital,」including social capital and「every type of capital is reducible in the last analysis to economic capital」(pp. 252–253). In summary, then, Bourdieu sees social capital as a form of capital possessed by members of a social network

or group. Through connections among the members, the capital can be used by members as credits. In this sense, social capital is a collective asset endowing members with credits, and it is maintained and reinforced for its utility when members continue to invest in the relationships.

For Coleman, social capital consists of two elements: it is an aspect of a social structure, and it facilitates certain actions of individuals within the structure (1990, p. 302). Whether any structural aspect is a capital depends on whether it serves a function for certain individuals engaged in particular activities. For this reason, social capital is not fungible across individuals or activities. Social capital is the resources, real or potential, gained from relationships. In his scheme of social action, Coleman (1990) delineates how actors exercise control over resources in which they have an interest, and how they are also interested in events (or the outcome of events) that are at least partially controlled by other actors. Thus, in order for their interests to gain from the outcome of an event, actors engage in exchanges and transfers of resources. These social relationships serve important functions in facilitating the actions of individual actors; they form the basis of social capital.

Coleman (1990) illustrates this point by using the examples of how clandestine groups among South Korean students (p. 302) or workers’

cells in the prerevolutionary communist movement in Russia (p. 304) not only provided social capital for individual participants, but also constituted social capital for the revolutionary movements themselves.

Parent–teacher associations (PTAs) and other social organizations allow individual parents and students to achieve personal goals, but they also offer resources to the school and to all administrators, teachers, students, and parents affiliated with the school. Coleman uses the example of a mother who moved from Detroit to Jerusalem because her children would be safer when going to the park and school by themselves as another illustration of how individual actors adapt to the social capital available in a collecitivity – the community. Thus, for Coleman and Bourdieu, dense or closed networks are seen as the means by which collective capital can be maintained and reproduction of the group can be achieved.

Putnam’s work on participation in voluntary organizations in democratic societies such as the United States strongly reflects the use of this perspective. He argues that such social associations and the degree of participation indicate the extent of social capital in a society. These associations and participation promote and enhance collective norms and trust, which are central to the production and maintenance of the collective well-being (Putnam 1993, 1995a).

While the two perspectives describe social capital differentially in

24

Theory and Research

terms of the level at which the utility or outcome can be assessed, all scholars remain committed to the view that it is the interacting members who make the maintenance and reproduction of this social asset possible. This consensual view puts social capital firmly in the neo-capital theory camp.2 Thus, Bourdieu, Coleman, Lin, Flap, Burt, Erickson, Portes, and others all share the understanding that social capital consists of resources embedded in social relations and social structure, which can be mobilized when an actor wishes to increase the likelihood of success in a purposive action. Like human capital, it is an investment on the part of the actor to increase the likelihood of success in purposive actions.

Unlike human capital, which represents investment in training and other programs of activities to acquire skills, knowledge, and certifications, social capital is an investment in social relationships through which resources of other actors can be accessed and borrowed. While the concept has been applied to a wide range of actions (e.g., moving to a different community that is safer for one’s children, mobilizing participants in a social movement; see Coleman 1990), and to both macro-

(e.g., number of participants and scope of participation in voluntary and community organizations and social groupings; see Putnam 1993, 1995a) and microlevels (e.g., job searches and promotions; see Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981; Burt 1997) of research, there is a converging consensus (Portes, Burt, Lin) that social capital, as a theory-generating concept, should be conceived in the social network context: as resources accessible through social ties that occupy strategic network locations (Burt) and/or significant organizational positions (Lin). This is the conceptualization I will use in this volume.

In this conceptualization, social capital may be defined operationally 2 Two major and different theoretical positions distinguish scholars in the collective asset camp. For Bourdieu, social capital represents a process by which individuals in the dominant class, by mutual recognition and acknowledgment, reinforce and reproduce a privileged group that holds various forms of capital (economic, cultural, and symbolic).

Nobility and titles characterize such groups and their members. Thus, social capital is another way of maintaining and reproducing the dominant class. I would characterize this theoretical position as one that views social capital as class (privilege) goods. The other position on social capital as a collective asset is represented by the works of Coleman and Putnam. Coleman, while defining social capital as consisting of any social-structural features or resources that are useful to individuals for specific actions, stresses social capital as a public good. These collective assets and features are available to all members of the group, be it a social group or a community, and regardless of which members actually promote, sustain, or contribute to such resources. Because social capital is a public good, it depends on the good will of the individual members to make such efforts and not to be free riders. Thus, norms, trust, sanctions, authority, and other structural features become important in sustaining social capital. If one were forced to trace the theoretical lineage of these two explanatory schemes, one could argue that the privileged-good view is principally an extension and elaboration of the social relations in Marx’s capital theory and that the public-good view is primarily an extension and elaboration of the integrative or Durkheimian view of social relations.

as the   resources embedded in social networks accessed and used by actors   for actions . Thus, the concept has two important components: (1) it represents resources embedded in social relations rather than individuals, and (2) access and use of such resources reside with actors. The first characterization, socially embedded resources, allows a parallel analysis between social capital and other forms of capital. For example, human capital, as envisioned by economists (Schultz, Becker) represents investment on the part of individuals to acquire certain skills and certifications that are useful in certain markets (e.g., the labor market). Social capital can also be envisioned as investment by individuals in interpersonal relationships useful in the markets. The second component of social capital, therefore, must reflect that ego is cognitively aware of the presence of such resources in her or his relations and networks and makes a choice in evoking the particular resources. There may be ties and relationships that do not appear in ego’s cognitive map and thus not in her or his awareness of their existence. Only when the individual is aware of their presence, and of what resources they possess or can access (these ties have their networks as well), can the individual capitalize such ties and resources. A systematic presentation of this conceptualization will begin in the next chapter.

Issues and Clarifications

Before I embark on the conceptual presentation, certain issues need to be discussed and clarified. Specifically, the divergence in perspectives has created some theoretical and measurement confusions. Further confusion arises from the fact that some discussions have flowed freely between levels. For example, Bourdieu provides a structural view in pointing to the dominant class and nobility groups’ reproduction as the principal explanation of social capital, which is represented by aggregating (1) the size of the group or network and (2) the volume of capital possessed by members (Bourdieu 1983/1986, p. 248). This representation makes sense only when it is assumed that all members maintain strong and reciprocal relations (a completely dense or institutionalized network), so that the strength of relations does not enter into the calculus. Yet, Bourdieu also describes how individuals interact and reinforce mutual recognition and acknowledgment as members of a network or group. Coleman (1990, Chap. 12), while emphasizing how individuals can use sociostruc-tural resources in obtaining better outcomes in their (individual) actions, devotes much discussion to the collective nature of social capital in stress-ing trust, norms, sanctions, authority, and closure as parts or forms of the concept. It is important to identify and sort through these views and

reach some understandings before we proceed to build a coherent theory of social capital. I identify some of these issues in Table 2.1.

One major controversy generated from macro- versus relational-level perspectives is whether social capital is collective goods or individual goods (see Portes’s 1998 critique). Most scholars agree that it is both collective and individual goods; that is, institutionalized social relations with embedded resources are expected to benefit both the collective and the individuals in the collective. At the group level, social capital represents some aggregation of valued resources (e.g., economic, political, cultural, or social, as in social connections) of members interacting as a network or networks. The difficulty arises when social capital is discussed as collective or even public goods, along with trust, norms, and other collective or public goods. What has occurred in the literature is that some terms have become alternative or substitutable terms or measurements. Divorced from its roots in individual interactions and networking, social capital becomes merely another trendy term to employ or deploy in the broad context of improving or building social integration and solidarity. In the following, I will argue that social capital, as a relational asset, must be distinguished from collective assets and goods such as culture, norms, trust, and so on. Causal propositions may be formulated (e.g., that collective assets, such as trust, promote relations and networks and enhance the utility of embedded resources, or vice versa; see Chapter 13), but it should not be assumed that they are all alternative forms of social capital or are defined by one another (e.g., trust is capital; Paxton 1999).

Another controversy related to the focus on social capital’s collective aspect is the assumed or expected requirement that there is closure or density in social relations and social networks (Bourdieu 1983/1986; Coleman 1990; Putnam 1993, 1995a). Bourdieu, from his class per-

Social Capital

27

spective, sees social capital as the investment of the members in the dominant class (as a group or network) engaging in mutual recognition and acknowledgment so as to maintain and reproduce group solidarity and preserve the group’s dominant position. Membership in the group is based on a clear demarcation (e.g., nobility, title, family) excluding out-siders. Closure of the group and density within the group are required.

Coleman, of course, does not assume such a class vision of society. Yet, he also sees network closure as a distinctive advantage of social capital, because it is closure that maintains and enhances trust, norms, authority, sanctions, and so on. These solidifying forces may ensure that network resources can be mobilized.

I believe that the requirement for network density or closure for the utility of social capital is not necessary or realistic. Research in social networks has stressed the importance of bridges in networks (Granovetter 1973; Burt 1992) in facilitating information and influence flows.

To argue that closure or density is a requirement for social capital is to deny the significance of bridges, structural holes, or weaker ties. The root of preferring a dense or closed network lies rather in certain outcomes of interest (Lin 1986, 1990, 1992a). For   preserving or maintaining   resources  (i.e., expressive actions), denser networks may have a relative advantage. Thus, for the privileged class, it would be better to have a closed network so that resources can be preserved and reproduced (e.g., Bourdieu 1983/1986) or for a mother to move to a cohesive community so that her children’s security and safety can be assured (Coleman 1990).

On the other hand, for   searching for and obtaining resources   not presently possessed (i.e., instrumental actions), such as looking for a job or a better job (e.g., Lin, Marsden, Flap, Burt), accessing and extending bridges in the network should be more useful. Rather than making the assertion that closed or open networks are required, it would be theoretically more viable to (1) conceptualize for what outcomes and under what conditions a denser or sparser network might generate a better return and (2) postulate deduced hypotheses (e.g., a denser network would be more likely to promote the sharing of resources, which in turn would maintain group or individual resources; or an open network would be more likely to access advantaged positions and resources, which in turn would enhance the opportunity to obtain additional resources) for empirical examination.

A third controversy that requires clarification is Coleman’s statement that social capital is any「social-structural resource」that generates returns for an individual in a specific action. He remarks that「social capital is defined by its function」and that「it is not a single entity, but a variety of different entities having two characteristics: They all consist of some aspect of a social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of

28

Theory and Research

individuals who are within the structure」(1990, p. 302). This   functional  view may implicate a tautology: social capital is identified when and if it works; the potential causal explanation of social capital can be captured only by its effect; or whether it is an investment depends on the return for a specific individual in a specific action. Thus, the causal factor is defined by the effectual factor. Clearly, it would be impossible to build a theory in which causal and effectual factors are folded into a singular function. This is not to deny that a functional relationship may be hypothesized (e.g., resources embedded in social networks make it easier to obtain better jobs). But the two concepts must be treated as separate entities with independent measurements (e.g., social capital is the investment in social relations, and better jobs are represented by occupational status or supervisory position). It would be incorrect to allow the outcome variables to dictate the specification of the causal variable (e.g., for actor X, kin ties are social capital because they channel X to get a better job, and for actor Y, kin ties are not social capital because they do not channel Y to get a better job). The hypothesized causal relationship may be conditioned by other factors (e.g., family characteristics may affect differential opportunities for building human and social capital) that need be specified in a more elaborate theory. A theory would lose parsimony quickly if the conditional factors become part of the definitions of the primary concepts. In fact, one would question whether it remains a theory if it is required to make a good prediction for every case and every situation.

Perhaps related to this indistinguishable view of social capital from its outcome – and perhaps given his view that social capital, as a collective good, can also be seen in many different forms, such as trust, norms, sanctions, authority, and so on – Coleman questions「whether social capital will come to be as useful a quantitative concept in social science as are the concepts of financial capital, physical capital, and human capital remains to be seen; its current value lies primarily in its usefulness for qualitative analyses of social systems and for those quantitative analyses that employ qualitative indicators」(1990, pp. 304–305). Again, the confusion can be seen as resulting from extending the notion of social capital beyond its theoretical roots in social relations and social networks, and the unattainable theoretical position that prediction holds for every individual case. Once these issues are resolved, social capital should and must be measurable.
