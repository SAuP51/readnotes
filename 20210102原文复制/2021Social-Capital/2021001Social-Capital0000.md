## Social Capital: A Theory of Social Structure and Action

In Social Capital , Nan Lin explains the importance of using social connections and social relations in achieving goals. Social capital, or resources accessed through such connections and relations, is critical (along with human capital, or what a person or an organization actually possesses) to individuals, social groups, organizations, and communities in achieving objectives.

This book places social capital in the family of capital theories (the classical and neoclassical theories), articulates its elements and propositions, presents research programs, findings, and agendas, and theorizes its significance in various moments of interactions between individual actions and social structure (for example, the primordial groups, social exchanges, organizations, institutional transformations, and cybernetworks). Nan Lin eloquently introduces a groundbreaking theory that forcefully argues and shows why「it is who you know」as well as「what you know」that make a difference in life and society.

Nan Lin is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Asian/Pacific Studies Institutes at Duke University. He is author of The Struggle for Tiananmen (1992); Social Support, Life Events and Depression (with Alfred Dean and Walter Ensel, 1986); Foundation of Social Research (1976); and The Study of Human Communication (1973). He is coeditor (with Peter Marsden) of Social Structure and Network Analysis (1982). His work has appeared in American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, and Social Forces, among other journals.

Professor Lin is Vice President of the American Sociological Association (1999–2000) and Academician at Academica Sinica, Taiwan. He is also honorary or advisory professor at numerous international universities in China, including People’s University, Huazhong University, Nankai University, Fudan University, and Zhongshan University, among others.

## Preface

Sociology, to me, is the study of choices in social relations. It explores the motivations for taking actions, examines what choices are available (perceived or real) in relations, and studies the consequences of such choices. Therefore, central to sociology is the analysis of both action and structure: choice behaviors in the context of structural opportunities and constraints. Choices are made within such opportunities and constraints, and choices interacting with structural opportunities and constraints can also alter or create structural opportunities and constraints.

1『核心名词，行动、结构。（2021-01-01）』

These processes necessarily shift between the macrostructure and the microstructure. How to capture and demonstrate these dynamics is what occupies sociologists’ time and efforts. 

This monograph is about a theory that suggests that actors (whether individual or corporate) are motivated by instrumental or expressive needs to engage other actors in order to access these other actors’ resources for the purpose of gaining better outcomes. The core proposition is that such accessed resources embedded in social relations, or social capital, bring about better outcomes. Thus, social capital is social and useful. It is ingrained in social relations and facilitated or constrained by them. But within such structural opportunities and constraints, action makes a difference; given the same extent and array of relations for two actors, the outcomes may differ, depending on their choice behaviors.

In this formulation, I accept the prevailing effects of structure and relations. Nevertheless, I want to stress the theoretical significance of choices.

To do this, I divide the monograph into two parts. In Part I, I begin with a historical account of capital theories (Chapter 1) and the ideas of social capital (Chapter 2). The next three chapters describe the theory from the structural perspective「down」to relational and action dynamics. Chapter 3 describes how resources are embedded in structures, including networks, and Chapter 4 describes how motivations and inter-actions propel actors to make choices. Chapter 5 summarizes the elements of the theory and introduces the propositions systematically. Two more chapters demonstrate the research utilities of the theory. Chapter 6 summarizes the research tradition linking social capital to status attainment, and Chapter 7 highlights the important research agenda of inequality in social capital.

In Part II, in extending the theory to several arenas of research, I turn the dynamics around, from choice actions to institutional and structural contexts. I begin with the micro- and mesodynamics to give more emphasis to choice actions. Chapter 8 explores the theoretical possibility that choice actions lead to social structure, and Chapter 9 extends this argument by showing how social exchange, in contrast to economic exchange, carries its own rationality. I continue the discussion of choices in the more constrained context of hierarchical organizations in Chapter 10. Chapter 11 turns to the topic of social change – how the theory of social capital, as formulated in this monograph, may help explain societal transformations, both within the context of existing institutions and in the creation of capital through social networking and alternative institutions. Chapter 12 explores the explosion of cybernetworks – social relations in cyberspace – and their significance for reevaluating the premature proclamation that social capital may be declining or dying, again highlighting how actions and choices in relations and networks retain and even gain vitality and power in a globalized and technologically advanced society.

Given the limited space of this monograph, certain choices had to be made regarding the coverage. I have decided to focus on the instrumental aspect of social capital and thus shortchange the expressive aspect of social capital, not that my own research efforts have ignored the latter (Lin 1979; Lin, Dean, and Ensel 1986; Lin and Ensel 1989; Lin and Lai 1995; Lin and Peek 1999; Lin, Ye, and Ensel 2000). The significance of expressive action in a theory of social capital is made clear in the discussion of the formulation of the theory in Chapters 4 and 5. I also mention how expressive action operates in several extensions of the theory (Chapters 8 to 11). However, to fully cover the expressive aspect of social capital would require perhaps another monograph of comparable size. Instead, I chose to focus on social capital for instrumental action in order to parallel discussions of two other similar topics: human capital and cultural capital. In human capital, as espoused by economists, the focus is on the returns in the labor market, especially economic returns. In cultural capital, à la Bourdieu, the concern is with the reproduction of the dominant class. In both cases, the instrumental use of capital is salient. Only in the Epilogue do I reintegrate expressive action, somewhat abbreviated still, in a full model of analysis for social capital.

I have also abbreviated the coverage of social capital as a collective asset, as my evaluation has convinced me that its theoretical and research viability can be extended from the formulations as outlined in this monograph, rather than being treated as a separate and independent entity (see Chapters 2, 8, and 12).

The work represented in this monograph can be traced back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when I began research on social networks in the United States, Central America, and Haiti. And I have continued to benefit from such comparative research experiences, which are now extended to East Asia as well. Along the way, I have benefited a great deal from many collaborators, including Ron Burt, John Vaughn, Clifford Melick, Walter Ensel, Ron Simeone, Mark Tausig, Mary Dumin, Mary Woelfel, Gina Lai, Yanjie Bian, Kristen Peek, Yushu Chen, Chih-jou Chen, Ray-May Hsung, Yang-Chih Fu, Xiaolan Ye, and Marc Magee. My intellectual network has extended to and included, among many others, Mark Granovetter, James Coleman, Henk Flap, Bonnie Erickson, Ron Breiger, Judith Blau, Robert Merton, Peter Marsden, Peter Blau, Jeanne Hurlbert, Harrison White, Barry Wellman, Edward Tiryakian, John Wilson, and Lulin Cheng. I have also benefited from interactions and friendships with colleagues at the Department of Sociology, SUNY–Albany, and the Department of Sociology, Duke University. They have been my vital social capital.

My research work, extending to several continents and stretching over three decades, has received important support from the National Science Foundation (the Sociology program and the International Program), the National Institute of Mental Health, the U.S. Department of Labor, the New York Department of Health, the Luce Foundation, the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Research Foundation of SUNY, and the Research Council of Duke University. Without their funding, it would not have been possible to conceive and examine many aspects of the theory presented in this monograph.

I also wish to thank three publishing houses for permission to reprint portions of the following pieces in this monograph: Cambridge University Press: 1990.

我认为社会学是研究行动者如何对社会关系进行选择的学科。社会学要探讨行动的动机，要考察哪些选择在社会关系中是可行的（感知的，或者真实的），还要研究这些选择的结果。因此，社会学的中心任务既要分析行动又要分析结构：在结构提供的机会与约束下的选择行为。选择是在这些机会与约束内作出的，与结构提供的机会和约束进行互动的选择也可以改变或创造这些机会与 约束。这些过程必然会在宏观结构与微观结构之间摆动。如何把握和展示这些动态，正是社会学家的工作。

本书所要阐述的是，行动者（无论个体或者集体）如何在工具性需要或者表达性需要的驱动下与其他行动者进行互动，从而获取其他行动者的资源以得到更好的回报。本书的核心命题是，这些嵌入在社会关系中的被获取的资源，或者说社会资本，可以带来好的回报。因此，社会资本是社会性的，是有用的。社会资本植根于社会关系中，社会关系会促进或者约束行动者对社会资本的获取和使用。但是在这些结构机会与约束之内，行动也很重要。两个社会关系相似的行动者，其行动结果可能不同，这取决于他们的选择行为。我承认结构和关系起主要作用，但是我也想强调选择的理论意义。

为达到以上目的，我将全书分成两部分。在第一部分中，我首先回顾了资本理论（第一章）与社会资本理论（第二章）。接下来的三章从结构视角到关系与行动的动力学，详细地闻述了社会资本理论。第三章描述了资源如何嵌入在结构与网络中，第四章描述了动机与互动如何推动着行动者作出选择。第五章系统地总结了社会资本的组成要素并介绍了相关命题。剩下的两章显示了社会资本理论的研究功用。第六章概括了社会资本与地位获得的研究传统，第七章将社会资本的不平等提上了重要研究议程。

在本书的第二部分里，我对社会资本理论进行了扩展，从选择行动的社会动力学（dynamics）到制度与结构的社会动力学都进行了论述。我首先阐述了选择行动的微观社会动力学和中观社会动力学。其中第八章探讨的是选择行动导致社会结构产生的理论可能性，第九章扩展了第八章的观点，说明了与经济交换相对照，社会交换本身的理性。第十章在约束性更强的等级制组织的背景下继续讨论选择的问题。第十一章谈到了社会变迁的话题 一一 无论是在现行制度的背景内，还是在通过社会网络运作而建造另类制度的情况下，社会资本理论都有助于解释社会转型。第十二章考査了电子网络 一一 电子空间中的社会关系 一一 的扩张，就电子网络而重新评价一个不成熟的观点：社会资本正在下降或衰亡，再次强调了关系与网络中的行动和选择如何在全球化、技术化的发达社会里保持，甚至更加具有活力。

由于篇幅有限，我不得不对本书的内容作一些调整。我将关注社会资本的工具性，而只对表达性进行简单的讨论，当然并不是我的研究忽视了后者（Lin, 1979; Lin, Dean, and Ensel, 1986; Lin and Ensel, 1989; Lin and Lai, 1995; in  and Peek,199i, Ye, and Ensel, 2000)。我在第四章和第五章中讨论社会资本理论的构想时，曾清楚地说明了表达性行动在社会资本理论中的意义。在社会资本理论的扩展部分里（第八章至十章），我也提到了表达性行动如何发挥作用。但是要对社会资本的表达性作详尽论述，需要再写一本同样规模的专著。我关注社会资本的工具性行动，是为了与另外两个相近的话题：人力资本和文化资本，进行比较。被经济学家采纳的人力资本关注劳动力市场中的回报，特别是经济回报。布迪厄的文化资本理论关注的是统治阶级的再生产。在这两个理论中，资本的工具性含义是很突出的。因此，我在本书中将对社会资本的工具性特意论述。在最后的总结中，我再一次将表达性行动纳入到社会资本分析的总体模型之中ー一虽然仍然是一个很简单的讨论。

1-2『这么说，社会资本的工具性是本书的主要内容，而社会资本的「表达性」也超级重要，只是篇幅所限，作者没法详细写出来。那么就可以去找一下，2001 以后，作者有没有新的著作写的「表达性」。（2021-01-01）』——待完成

我也删节了刻意对社会资本作为集体资产的含意的论述，因为我认为它可以被本专著的理论与研究整体架构所包含。（参见第二章、第八章和第十章）

本书的写作渊源可以追溯到 20 世纪 60 年代晚期和 70 年代早期，那时我开始研究美国、中美洲和海地的社会网络，然后扩展到东亚。我一直得益于这些比较研究经验。这本书的写作也得益于我的很多合作者，他们是：（省略）。此外，还要感谢纽约州立大学奥尔巴尼分校（Shny-Albany）社会学系和杜克大学（Duke University）社会学系的同事们，我从与他们的交流和友谊中获得了很多东西。上述学者已经成为我的重要社会资本。
