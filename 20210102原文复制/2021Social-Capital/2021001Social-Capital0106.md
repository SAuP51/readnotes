This chapter1 examines a critical issue in social capital research –

inequality in social capital, or the extent to which social capital is unequally distributed across social groups in a community or population. First, I will consider some general issues and approaches to the analysis of inequality in all types of capital. These considerations will lead to formulations of research agenda, and data from urban China will then be used to illustrate them. The chapter will conclude with a brief statement about the future research agenda.

Theoretical Considerations

Social inequality is a major research issue; its etiology demands attention. From the capital theoretic perspective, we may make the initial proposition that inequality in different types of capital, such as human capital and social capital, brings about social inequality, such as in socioeconomic standing and quality of life. Given this proposition, we may further explore the processes leading to inequality in capital. In this formulation, the plan is to identify the specific mechanisms that lead to inequality in capital, which in turn affects social inequality. Thus, the research task is twofold: identification and verification of mechanisms leading to inequality in capital, and demonstration of the linkage between inequality in capital and social inequality among social groups.

The initial proposition, linkage between capital inequality and social inequality, has been the guiding theory regarding different types of 1 I want to acknowledge Marc Magee’s assistance in this analysis. The study reported here was supported in part by a grant from the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation. An earlier version was presented at the twenty-eighth Sino-American Conference held on June 12–14, 1999, at Duke University.

capital (Chapters 1–6). This chapter explores the formulation of processes accounting for inequality in capital, including social capital.

It is argued that capital inequality may result from two processes: capital deficit and return deficits.   Capital deficit   refers to the consequence of a process by which differential investment or opportunities result in relative shortage (in quantity or quality) of capital for one group compared with another. For example, families may invest more in the human or social capital of their sons compared to their daughters. Or different social groups may be embedded in different social hierarchies or social networks that facilitate or constrain their members’ capital acquisition.

Return deficit   is the consequence of a process by which a given quality or quantity of capital generates a differential return or outcome for members of different social groups. For example, males and females, with a given quality or quantity of social capital, receive differential returns in status attainment – such as positions in organizations, occupational prestige, or earnings.

Inequality in capital between social groups may be due to capital deficit, return deficit, or both. Consider the problem of gender inequality in the labor market. A substantial literature suggests that a gendered labor market accounts for differential earnings for males and females in different occupations (Treiman and Terrell 1975; Bose and Rossi 1983; Bielby and Baron 1986; Jacobs 1989; England, Farkas, Kilbourne, and Don 1988; Reskin 1988, 1993; Kilbourne, England, Farkas, Beron, and Weir 1994; Reskin and Roos 1990; England 1992a, 1992b; Tomaskovic-Devey 1993). Yet, little theory or research has refined the empirical finding of a gendered occupational structure, and has systematically explored the mechanisms that account for different group members’ differential allocations in structural positions, and the subsequent returns or rewards to members of different social groups (see Tam 1997 for a competing argument). From the capital theoretic perspective, we may offer two possible explanations for these possible relationships.

The capital deficit explanation focuses on the differential acquisition of capital. One process may be differential investment: it hypothesizes that families invest differentially in capital for male and female children.

We may speculate that in most societies, families anticipating a labor market and an economy that provide differential returns for males and females wish to be competitive by investing more capital in sons than in daughters. Thus, it may be expected that males are favored over females for both education (human capital) and extensity of social networks (social capital). A second process may be differential opportunities: prevailing social structure and institutions (rules and practices or culture; see Chapter 11) differentially afford opportunities for males and females in developing capital. Male children are encouraged and rewarded for

Inequality in Social Capital  101

extensity and heterogeneity of social ties, while female children are constrained or even punished for doing so. These two processes result in differential capital deficit; females will acquire less capital in terms of quality and quantity. Capital deficit, in this formulation, is expected to account for the differential placements and rewards received by males and females.

Return deficit explanation, on the other hand, focuses on the return to capital – in the labor market, for example. The argument is that it is the return to capital in the labor market that differentiates males and females. In this case, it may be assumed that even when males and females have relatively equal (quality or quantity of) capital, they have different status outcomes in the labor market. That is, the labor market differentially rewards males and females for their capital. Given the same quality or quantity of capital, males will generate greater rewards than females in the labor market, such as positions in the organization, occupational titles or prestige, and earnings. Three different explanations may be offered for this scenario. In one, females may not use or mobilize the appropriate capital for the instrumental action of attainment in the labor market. For example, they may not use the best social ties and thus the best possible social capital in the attainment process, either because they are cognitively unable to identify the best possible social ties and social capital or because they hesitate to mobilize such social capital due to perceived lack of resources or capacity to return the favor. Alternatively, the appropriate social ties are mobilized, but for real or imagined reasons, these ties are reluctant to invest their capital on ego’s (the female’s) behalf. These ties may suspect that employers would be more resistant to female candidates and would not take their recommendation or influence seriously. Such wasted influence would be a cost rather than a prize for their investment in the candidate. Not「putting out」may also be the cultured or institutionally expected understanding, as even for the females and their families, less effort is expected from social ties on behalf of ego. A third explanation for a return deficit may be the differential responses from the labor market’s structure itself: employers respond differentially to male and female job/promotion candidates even if they present similar human and/or social capital – a bias shared by organizations in an institutional field (an institutional field is a social community in which the organizations share a set of prevailing values and practices; see Chapter 11 and Lin 1994b).

In summary, we can propose the following mechanisms for social inequality from the perspective of capital theories: 1. Capital deficit is due to (a) differential investment or (b) differential opportunity.

102

Theory and Research

2. Return deficit is due to (a) differential mobilization of appropriate capital resulting from cognitive deficiency or reluctance to mobilize; (b) differential effort by intermediary agents; or (c) differential responses by organizations and institutions to the mobilized capital.

3. Return deficit may or may not occur independent of capital deficit. Certain social inequalities may be due to capital deficit distributed in different social groups. Other types of inequality may be due mainly to return deficit: social groups may have a similar quality and quantity of capital and yet may generate differential returns. For still other types of inequality, both capital deficit and return deficit may account for inequality among social groups. These mechanisms may also vary in different communities or societies.

The preceding can thus be seen as hypotheses regarding inequality in different types of capital (e.g., human, institutional, and social capital), among different social groups (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, religion), for different labor markets (e.g., economic, political, educational), and for different societies. The remainder of the chapter employs a recently collected data set from urban China to illustrate how such specification and analysis can be undertaken to shed light on the inequality in social capital between males and females. While the focus will be on social capital, the data also permit some analysis of the two groups’ human and institutional capital. The data cannot be used for specification and analysis of all the possible mechanisms mentioned previously. However, it is hoped that the analysis will demonstrate how fruitful such a「decomposed」

approach can be in shedding light on the critical issue of inequality in social capital and its consequences for male and female attainment in the urban Chinese labor market.

The Study, Sample, and Data

Three research questions are asked in this exploratory study: (1) Do males and females have different social capital? (2) If so, is this difference due to capital deficit, return deficit, or both? (3) What are the consequences of inequality of social capital for males and females in getting ahead in the labor market? The data used here are derived from a 1998

survey of eighteen cities. Fifteen of these cities were sampled from a stratified probability sample of all cities. Stratification was based on region (coastal, central, and interior) and economic status (high, medium, and low). Three additional cities were sampled from three outlier regions (Pingliang, Ge’ermu, and Tacheng). Appendix 7.1 presents the cities and

Inequality in Social Capital  103

the sample sizes from these sites. City-level data were also collected for multilevel analyses. However, the present study, a preliminary analysis, concerns only individual-level data.

The sample consists of 3,050 respondents, aged nineteen to sixty-nine inclusive, who were participating or had participated in the labor force of these eighteen cities at the time of the survey. The basic characteristics of these respondents appear in Table 7.1. The sample consists of 43.5

percent males and 56.4 percent females. The average age is forty-one, Table 7.1.   Summary of Sample Characteristics (N  =   3,050)  Gender

and there is no significant difference in age between the male and female respondents. Nine of ten respondents were married, 6.7 percent were single, and 3.3 percent were divorced or widowed. About half (52

percent) of the respondents lived in large cities when they were sixteen years old. Female respondents were slightly more likely to have lived in large cities than males.

Deficit in Human and Institutional Capital

This study examined three types of capital: human, institutional, and social. Human capital is indicated by education, work experience, tenure,

Inequality in Social Capital  105

and on-the-job training. Education is measured by years of education.

As can be seen in Table 7.1, about a third of the respondents had less than high school education, 41 percent of them had high school education, and a quarter of them had college or higher education. Males were better educated than females. Males also had somewhat longer work experience (an average of 22.3 years) than females (21.1 years), but there was no difference in tenure or in number of years at the current work unit. Males were also more likely to have received on-the-job training (in terms of the number of different types of training and the number certificates received from training) than females. In short, then, males showed substantial advantage over females in human capital.

Institutional capital   is capital associated with the identification and association of prevailing ideology and power (Lin 1994b, 1995b; see also Chapter 11). It is indicated by membership in the Communist Party, ownership of the work unit, and rank of the current position. Party membership was coded as (1) not a member, (2) a Party member when entering the current job, and (3) a Party member when entering the first job. As can be seen in Table 7.1, a significantly higher percentage of males (36.2 percent) than females (19.9 percent) were Party members, and male Party members had been in the Party relatively longer than females.

Until recently, ownership of the work unit differentiated workers in the Chinese dual labor market (Lin and Bian 1991; Bian 1994). However, in the 1990s, a more diverse and marketized labor market emerged. A small but increasingly significant market was created by joint ventures (although most of the Chinese partners in these firms were state or collective enterprises or institutes), private firms, and household (self) enterprises. Of these types of work units, collectives are most disadvantaged, as they do not have the security and status of the state work units or the economic and market benefits of the joint ventures. Currently, private and household enterprises tend to be small in both size and scale of economy. As can be seen, a significantly larger percentage of females (15.5 percent) than males (9.2 percent) were employed in the collectives.

Rank of current position is another indicator of institutional capital, since these positions command differential resources in the state and collective enterprises where over 90 percent of the respondents work. Again, there was a significant difference in the ranks occupied by males and females. Over four-fifths (84 percent) of the females held no rank titles compared to less than two-thirds (64.7 percent) of the males.

Close to a quarter (23.6 percent) of the males held ranks at and above departmental level compared to less than one-tenth (8.3 percent) of the females.

In short, then, males held an overwhelming advantage over females in institutional capital.

Measures of Social Capital: The Position Generator The third type of capital studied was social capital. I employed the position-generator method for measurement (for a review of this method, see Chapter 6). Two types of social capital were constructed: general social capital and political social capital. The instrument used is reproduced in English in Appendix 7.2.

For general social capital, thirteen occupations were sampled from a full list of all occupations to represent different levels of socioeconomic status (SES) (see Bian 1994 and Lin and Ye 1997 for the occupational socioeconomic scale development and status scores for various occupations in China). These were university professor (SES score of 91), mayor (83), head of a bureau (76), lawyer (72), journalist (68), head of an enterprise (67), chief of a section (60), elementary school teacher (58), worker (45), administrative personnel (45), electrician (44), farmer (30), and housemaid (11). The position generator question was:「Of your relatives, friends, and acquaintances, is there anyone who has the jobs listed in the following table?」If the response was「yes,」the respondent was asked if she or he knew this person at the time when she or he was looking for the current job. If the response was again affirmative, the respondent received a score of「1」for that position and was asked a series of questions concerning the relations between the respondent and the position occupant. If the respondent knew more than one occupant of the position, we asked him or her to think of the first occupant who came to mind. Information regarding indirect access (access through intermediaries) was also obtained but was not used in the present study.

From these data, three variables were constructed: (1) the number of positions accessed, (2) the prestige score of the highest accessed position, and (3) the range of the prestige scores of positions accessed (the difference between the highest and lowest prestige scores among accessed positions). These were indicators of access to general social capital.

Since political connections may remain significant in state socialist China, the instrument also listed three Party cadre positions: (1) provincial or city Party secretary, (2) Party secretary of a bureau, and (3) Party secretary of a factory or institute; these positions formed a political power hierarchy. Again, three variables were constructed: (1) the number of positions accessed, (2) the rank score of the highest accessed position, and (3) the rank scores range of positions accessed. Variations of the three scores, as will be seen, were very limited, but results suggest that they were meaningful.

Deficit in Social Capital for Females

Table 7.2 presents the basic statistics on the two types of social capital variables. First, we summarize general social capital. As can be seen, the average number of accessed positions was 6.7 out of 13 sampled positions, with males accessing an average of 7 positions and females 6.5, for a statistically significant difference. The highest prestige among accessed positions was 75 (about the position of the head of a bureau), with males again having a significant advantage over females (76 versus 74.2). The range of prestige scores between the highest and lowest prestige scores of accessed positions was 40, with males advantaged over females (41.3 versus 39). It is clear that males had significantly better general social capital than females on all three indicators.

Theory and Research

The most accessible position was worker (94 percent of the respondents), followed by chief of a section (82 percent), electrician (79

percent), elementary school teacher (75 percent), farmer (72 percent), administrative personnel (71 percent), and head of an enterprise (62

percent). There was a sharp drop in accessibility from over half of the respondents to less than a third of the respondents. The next cluster of accessed positions included lawyers (28 percent), journalists (27 percent), housemaids (26 percent), and heads of bureaus (24 percent). The least accessible position was mayor, accessed only by 10 percent of the respondents. This pattern reflected the differentials in social contacts among a representative sample of urban respondents who showed, not surpris-ingly, greater contacts, and therefore access, to others who occupied positions either similar to their own or slightly higher or lower than theirs, in the prestige hierarchy’s middle rankings.

The advantage of males over females was reflected in most of the sampled positions. As shown in Table 7.2, male respondents were more likely than females to access every position except elementary school teachers, workers, farmers, and housemaids, all of which were on the lower half of the prestige ranking scale. Thus, the males had an advantage in reaching positions similar to or better than theirs in the prestige hierarchy.

As for political social capital (also shown in Table 7.2), males had the advantage over females on all three variables. They accessed more cadre positions, higher-ranked cadres, and a larger range of positions. At each hierarchical level, males also had greater access.

To assess whether the three variables for each type of social capital could be considered as a cluster, or indicators of a single dimension perhaps called「access to social capital,」we performed a factor analysis on the three variables. The analysis (principal component and varimax rotation), as shown in Table 7.3, resulted in a three-factor solution for each type of social capital.

For general social capital, the first factor had an eigenvalue of 2.47, while the second and third factors had very small eigenvalues. These results strongly suggest a single dimensionality among the three variables. When we restricted solutions for factors having eigenvalues greater than 1.0, the factor loadings of the three variables on the single factor were all very high (.84, .96, and .92). Thus, a factor score was constructed with differential weights assigned to the three variables where the range variable received the greatest weight (.13 for number of positions accessed, .63 for the range variable, and .25 for the highest prestige of an accessed position). When separate analyses were conducted for males and females, similar patterns emerged. Thus, the decision was to

use the same scoring weights to construct a general social capital score for all respondents.

For political social capital, a three-factor solution also showed concentration of variance explained in the first factor and similarity in the solution patterns for both males and females. Factor scores of the three variables on the first principal factor again yielded almost identical patterns for males and females. However, unlike general social capital, where the range variable carried the strongest weight or coefficient in the score, the number of positions accessed and the highest rank had high coefficients. This is understandable, as the range was extremely limited and overlapped substantially with the other two variables.

It is clear that inequality between urban Chinese males and females in social capital as of 1998 was due at least in part to capital deficit. This capital deficit by females prevailed in all three types of capital: human capital, institutional capital, and social capital.

Further Analysis for Social Capital Deficit

How, then, is social capital related to the other two types of capital –

human capital and institutional capital? Would such relations account for the relative deficit of social capital for females? Human capital and social capital, as conceptualized (see Chapter 2), are expected to be related. It would be interesting to assess whether such a relationship varies for males and females. As argued elsewhere (Chapter 11), institutional capital is significant in the labor market for both organizations and individuals as they attempt to match and interact with the larger society’s prevailing values and practices. In Chinese society, even in the 1990s, the Communist Party held much of the valued resources and exercised power over much of the population. Whether such institutional capital was differentially related to social capital for males and females, especially to political social capital, deserves research attention.

Kin versus Nonkin Ties

In addition to these two types of capital, the nature of social ties evoked in accessing social capital was considered. The question posed was: do different types of social ties lead to differential access to social capital?

As conceived by the network location scholars (see Chapters 3 and 5), ties that serve as bridges in the networks might be more useful in accessing better-embedded resources in the social structure. No direct measure was possible in the survey instrument to assess whether each position accessed was a bridge in the shared networks. However, the survey did ascertain the relationship between the respondent and the occupant of the position accessed (see Appendix 7.2). A simple kin versus nonkin classification was constructed. I use this measure to represent stronger versus weaker ties. In the Chinese context, kin ties represent extensive yet strong ties (Lin 1989). This does not argue that only kin ties are strong; even in the Chinese context, other social ties (e.g., coworkers, school alumni, regional ties) may also be strong (Bian 1997; Ruan 1998).

Thus, this measure is a relatively weak and conservative estimate of tie strength. The initial hypothesis is that, following Granovetter’s argument (1973, 1974),   weaker ties (i.e., nonkin ties) tend to access better general   social capital .

However, the cultural context of Chinese society presents an alternative consideration. Much has been said about the significance of familial ties among the Chinese (Fei, 1947/1992). Some have ventured to suggest that familial ties constitute the meaningful core social structure in a Chinese society (Lin 1989). Because the Chinese definition of family

Inequality in Social Capital  111

extends beyond the immediate nuclear family to include multiple generations and multiple clan and marital linkages, it may well be that such extensive networks provide sufficient access to many parts of the society.

Further, in a society where formal institutions block many forms of legitimate access to resources, trust is paramount when interpersonal relations are evoked for utilitarian purposes. There is evidence (Bian, 1997) that stronger ties rather than weaker ties are preferred when seeking effective help in job searches. Thus, accessing power positions (Party cadres) in a state socialist system may signal informal access to resources that cannot be accessed through formal channels and processes. Such relationships are better if they remain informal and

「invisible」so that exchanges can continue in the constrained structure.

To maintain such informal ties would probably require commitments to relations (see Chapter 9) beyond casual exchanges and transactions.

Thus, stronger ties might network well here. Given these considerations, it may be postulated that in Chinese society, kin ties present a certain advantage in political exchanges. We therefore propose the alternative hypothesis that   kin ties rather than nonkin ties access better political   social capital . We will submit these two alternative hypotheses to empirical examination.

In Table 7.4, the relative advantages or disadvantages of kin versus nonkin ties in accessing the positions are examined. In general social capital (the first thirteen rows of Table 7.4), females were more likely than males to use kin ties to access most positions. The only exceptions were elementary school teachers and housemaids, where males used kin ties as much as or more than females for access. In other words, males were more likely than females to use nonkin ties to access most positions. When it came to accessing elementary school teachers and housemaids, males were just as likely to use kin ties – probably their spouses.

Since we know that males are advantaged in accessing social capital, these data strongly hint that nonkin ties are more likely to access better social capital. This speculation is confirmed when we examine the zero-order correlations between the use of kin ties and the three variables of general social capital. As can be seen in the next three rows of the table, all coefficients were negative, indicating that the use of kin ties was negatively related to the number of positions accessed, the range of prestige scores among accessed positions, and the highest prestige score of an accessed position. Thus, we conclude that nonkin ties are more advantaged in accessing the general social capital. If nonkin ties represent weaker ties, then this result confirms the strength-of-weak-tie argument proposed by Granovetter.

The lower panel of Table 7.4 examines the relationship between the use of kin ties and access to political social capital. While there was no

difference between males and females in using kin ties to access city secretaries, females were again more likely to use kin ties to access bureau and factory secretaries. However, in contrast to the negative association between kin ties and better general social capital, there were positive correlations between kin ties and access to political social capital. These associations were much more pronounced for females than for males. If kin ties represent stronger ties, then there is some evidence that, perhaps for females, stronger ties may have a slight advantage than weaker ties in their accessing political social capital.

Patterns of Capital Deficits

Next, I conducted a multivariate analysis in which access to social capital was regressed on the nature of social networks (percentage of kin ties in the access to social capital), human capital (education), and institutional capital (party membership) simultaneously. Different equations were constructed for the two types of social capital (general and political) and for males and females. Also, for each equation, age, marital status (married), and household size (logged) were controlled for. As presented in Table 7.5, access to social capital for both males and females was affected by human capital (education), as expected. Institutional capital (Party membership) had only a slightly positive effect on social capital.

Network effects were significant but, as shown earlier, were more complex. Use of kin ties had negative effects on general social capital, whereas use of kin ties had positive effects on political social capital.

Also, the network effects were more significant for females than for males.

We may summarize the findings thus far regarding the distribution of social capital for females and males – the issue of capital deficit. There was a substantial capital deficit for females. Males showed access to a Table 7.5.   Determinants of Access to Social Capital (Partial   Regression Coefficients, with Standardized Coefficients in Parentheses)  Access to General Social

greater number of occupational and political positions, to higher positions in the hierarchies, and to a greater variety of positions. Social capital was found to be significantly related to human capital. Because males had higher educational attainment than females, there was a corresponding advantage in their social capital as well. There did not seem to be much difference in whether institutional capital (Party membership) affected social capital for females and males. Weaker ties (nonkin ties) facilitated access to general social capital, and stronger ties (kin ties) enhanced access to political social capital. Females seemed to rely more on such network ties to access social capital than males. Whether such differential access to social capital translated into advantages or disadvantages in generating returns in the labor market will be examined next.

Return on Social Capital

The next analytic tasks were to assess the effects of social capital on status attainment. Four attainment variables were used: (1) work sector (work unit ownership), (2) rank of position, (3) job prestige, and (4) monthly income (logged). As seen in Table 7.1, the work sectors in which the respondents were currently employed included the state sector, the collective sector, joint-venture enterprises, private enterprises, and the self-employed. Working in the state was a distinctive advantage (Lin and Bian 1991; Bian 1994) and was considered by many as the primary target of status attainment, rather than job or income per se. While the rapid transformation since the late 1980s in the social stratification system and in the reconstruction of state enterprises might have affected the work preferences of workers, the state sector – especially with its dominance in agencies, organizations, and institutes – might still offer advantages over the emerging private and joint-venture sectors in areas such as job security, housing discounts, health care, and pensions.

Rank of position (also seen in Table 7.1) reflects an array of positions along a hierarchical structure. For the present analysis, these positions were converted into an ordered set ranging from「1」for no title to「9」

for bureau or higher level. The occupational groupings, as shown in Table 7.1, were also examined as dummy variables. In both multinomial and logistic regression analyses, these groupings showed linear relationships (in terms of estimate coefficients), in either ascending or descend-ing order, with other key variables (e.g., sector, rank, and income), farming, and manufacturing alternately showing the lowest coefficients.

Thus, for parsimony, it was decided that the current job of each respondent would be converted into a prestige score, according to the scheme

Inequality in Social Capital  115

developed by Lin and Ye for China (1997). Two measures of income were used: the current monthly salary and the current monthly income, which included both salary and bonus.

These variables are seen as a sequential set of statuses of attainment: an individual first enters a work sector, assumes a ranked position in the organization, occupies a job, and earns an economic return. The analyses will focus on each of these attainment variables as the endogenous (dependent) variables in the sequence. As the analysis proceeds to later endogenous variables in the sequence, preceding endogenous variables also become exogenous variables. The first set of analyses assesses the effects of human capital (education, training, and certificates), institutional capital (Party membership), and social capital (general and political) on landing in one of the work sectors in the current job. Since there were five sectors (state, collective, joint venture, private, and self-employed), multinomial logistic regressions were employed to estimate the odds-ratio likelihood of being in a particular sector given these exogenous variables. As shown in Table 7.6, the state sector is the (missing) reference sector. Thus, these estimates showed the relative effects of human capital, institutional capital, and social capital on each of the other sectors compared to those in the state sector. Separate analyses were conducted for males and females. Age and urban residence at age sixteen were also controlled for.

Experience and tenure were both highly correlated with age (.94 and

.54). In the Chinese context, most workers still enjoy lifetime employment; and experience and tenure do not add any additional asset to Table 7.6.   Determinants of the Sector of the Current Job (Multinomial   Logistic Regression Coefficients, with State Sector as the Comparison   Group)

seniority, as represented by age. Since age, training, and certificates are already in the equations, experience and tenure were excluded, as their inclusion would have simply created multicolinearity biases to the estimates.

Since most of the respondents were in either the state or the collective sector, the analyses for the remaining sectors (i.e., joint ventures, private enterprises, and self-employed) were based on small sample sizes, with unreliable estimates. Nevertheless, the patterns seem consistent. As expected, education had a negative effect in any sector other than the state sector. This effect was most pronounced for those in the collective sector. Training also showed some negative effects for those in private or household enterprises compared with those in the state sector.

However, due to small sample sizes, these effects were unreliable. Party membership also had a slight but consistently negative effect on being in any sectors other than the state sector. Social capital had slight negative effects, especially for males in the collective rather than the state sector and for females in the household enterprises sector. Thus, we found moderate but consistent negative effects of human capital, institutional capital, and social capital for those not in the state sector.

Our analyses now turn to three sequential endogenous (dependent) variables: being in the state sector, the rank of the position, and job prestige. As can be seen in Table 7.7, I employed a path-analytic strategy in the analyses since these three dependent variables were considered in a causal sequence, with the assumption that entering work sectors preceded holding a rank or a position, and gaining jobs with certain prestige which, in turn, resulted in differential earnings. Again, analyses were conducted separately for males and females.

The first two columns in Table 7.7 present the results of logistic regression analyses pertaining to entrance into the state sector compared to other sectors. Being in the state sector was highly associated with education. Training and certificates were correlated with education (.24 and

.21) and did not show any significant marginal effects. Being a Party member was also significantly associated with being in the state sector.

Social capital showed positive but marginal effects, except for females.

Females benefited from political social capital in entering the state sector.

Thus, there is little evidence that females entering the state sector suffered a return deficit in social capital.

The third and fourth columns in Table 7.7 examine the effects of these variables on gaining higher-ranked positions. In addition, sectors were entered as an exogenous variable in the ordinary regression analyses (the state sector was used as the reference sector). As can be seen, both males and females generated returns from human capital (education and age), with the benefit more pronounced for males than for females. Institu-

tional capital (Party membership) benefited males and females equally.

Political social capital had a positive effect on the ranking of the position, especially for females.

The last two columns in Table 7.7 estimate the effects of these variables, plus the rank of the position, on job prestige. Again, both males and females benefited from education. Social capital no longer had any direct effects; rather, their effects on job prestige, especially the effect of political social capital, were mediated through being in the state sector and the position ranking – also institutional capital. Position rank benefited males more than females in getting more prestigious jobs. While being in the state sector (in contrast to being in the collective sector) ben-

efited males in getting more prestigious jobs, females seemed to get better jobs if they were in the collective sector. Since the collective sector is a peripheral sector in comparison to the state sector, it is clear that institutional capital was a more effective mediating factor in political social capital effects on job prestige for males but not for females.

Finally, we turn to income (monthly salary and income logged). In Table 7.8, the first two columns examine effects of human capital and

Inequality in Social Capital  119

institutional capital on salary for males and females. While females seemed to benefit more from human capital (education), males tended to benefit more from institutional capital. Both rank and job prestige showed much stronger effects on salary for males than for females. Being in the joint-venture sector generated the best returns for both males and females. However, being in the state sector, in contrast to being in the collective sector, greatly benefited males but not females. When the two social capital variables were added to the equations (the third and fourth columns), both males and females generated returns from general social capital. Females, however, gained added, though moderate, benefits from political social capital. Analysis for income (salary and bonus), as shown in Table 7.9, yielded results that were almost identical to those obtained for salary alone.

In summary, there is some evidence that females do not particularly suffer a return deficit on social capital in entering the state sector, gaining higher-ranked positions, or earning higher wages. In fact, they enjoy a slight edge in generating return from political social capital, getting into the state sector, and gaining higher-ranked positions and better wages.

These findings do not imply that females have gained equality in rank, occupations, or wages. In fact, they fared much worse than males on these status measures in the stratification system (see Table 7.1). These findings merely suggest that females need to mobilize political social capital effectively to close these gaps somewhat.

What accounts for the effects of political social capital for females? As we already understand from Table 7.2, females suffered a deficit in both general social capital and political social capital compared to males.

While social capital was associated with human and institutional capital, there was no evidence that females gained any advantage over males because of these other types of capital. In fact, females suffered from capital deficits in these two domains as well. The clue to females’ ability to deflect these deficits somewhat lies in the nature of social ties accessing political social capital. As shown in Table 7.4 and discussed earlier, kin ties constitute a positive factor in accessing political social capital, and more females use kin ties than males.

In further exploring these social ties to access political social capital, it was suspected that access to factory and bureau secretaries was a key, as females were much more likely than males to use kin ties to access these key positions (Table 7.4). The data in Table 7.10 show that, especially in accessing factory secretaries, these ties tended to be through a spouse and a sibling’s spouse for females. Thus, females may have gained some benefit through such strong ties in accessing local political resources, as these family ties helped some female workers move up in the work unit ranks and gain a break in wages.

Summary and Discussion

A critical issue for social capital research is the extent to which inequality in social capital contributes to social inequality across social groups.

This chapter conceptualizes this issue by proposing the analysis of two processes from the capital perspective: capital deficit and return deficit.

Capital deficit is the extent to which different social groups, for reasons

of investment or opportunities, have come to possess a different quality or quantity of capital. Return deficit is the extent to which a given quality or quantity of capital generates differential returns for different social groups due to differential mobilization strategies, agent efforts, or institutional responses. Since it is assumed that social inequality results from inequality in capital, it becomes important to understand inequality in capital. These formulations help clarify the mechanisms by which inequality in various types of capital, including social capital, emerges for different social groups, and how it potentially affects social inequality among members of different groups.

Data from urban China residents were used to explore these mechanisms for male and female attainment in the labor market. With the

position-generator instrument used to measure both general and political social capital, the results confirm that Chinese female workers suffer a deficit in social capital as well as human and institutional capital. Males show access to a greater number of occupational and political positions, to higher positions in hierarchies, and to a greater variety of positions.

Social capital is found to be significantly related to human capital.

Because males have higher educational attainment, they have a corresponding advantage in social capital as well. There does not seem to be much difference in whether institutional capital (Party membership) affects social capital for females and males.

On the other hand, there is some evidence that females do not particularly suffer from a return deficit in social capital upon entering the state sector, gaining higher-ranked positions, or earning higher wages. In fact, they enjoy a slight edge in generating returns from political social capital, entering the state sector, gaining higher-ranked positions, and earning higher wages. These findings do not imply that females have gained equality in rank, occupations, or wages. In fact, they fare much worse than males on these status measures in the stratification system. These findings merely suggest that females need to mobilize political social capital effectively to close these gaps somewhat.

One clue to why females are able to bridge the gap is due to the nature of the ties used to access social capital. Females seem to rely more on kin ties to access social capital than males do. Since weaker ties (nonkin ties) facilitate access to general social capital, females thus become disadvantaged in accessed capital. However, stronger ties (kin ties) enhance access to political social capital due to the need for trust and commitment in such relations in China. Thus, some females, relying on their spouses and the spouses of kin, might be able to gain better access to political social capital, which helps to overcome their disadvantages in entering the state sector and gaining higher-ranked positions and better wages.

As mentioned in Chapter 6, differential access to social capital deserves much greater research attention. It was suggested that social groups (gender, race) have different access to social capital because of their advantaged or disadvantaged structural positions and social networks.

For the disadvantaged to gain a better status, strategic behaviors require them to access resources beyond their usual social circles (Ensel 1979), find sponsors in the firm (Burt 1998), and join clubs dominated by males (Beggs and Hurlbert 1997); find ties outside their own neighborhood or those who are employed (Green, Tigges, and Browne 1995); or find ties across ethnic boundaries (Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch 1995; Stanton-Salazar 1997). This study, in a limited way, illustrates the viability of the capital perspective in analyzing social inequality.

Inequality in Social Capital  123

The notions of capital inequality, capital deficit, and return deficit help us to decompose and clarify the mechanisms by which inequality of capital (especially social capital) comes about between social groups and the consequences of these inequalities for social inequality. At the same time, they help to isolate the cultural and institutional nature of such inequalities for a given society and demonstrate the strategic significance (i.e., for females to use kin ties to access political social capital) for the disadvantaged within such institutional contexts. The research agenda outlined and the empirical study explored in the present chapter suggest that systematic empirical investigations equipped with specific measures and designs to flush out institutional and cultural variations can be fruitful in advancing understanding of capital inequality and social inequality for different social groups, on different social inequalities, and in different communities and societies.
