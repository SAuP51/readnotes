# 0106. Social Capital and Status Attainment

A Research Tradition

This chapter1 presents a research tradition reflecting the proposed linkage between social capital and instrumental action. Specifically, it investigates how social capital enhances the likelihood of getting better jobs. It thus falls within the general research paradigm known as the status attainment process .

Status attainment can be understood as a process by which individuals mobilize and invest resources for returns in socioeconomic standing.

The theoretical and empirical work for understanding and assessing the status attainment process can be traced to the seminal study reported by Blau and Duncan (1967). The major conclusion was that even accounting for both the direct and indirect effects of ascribed status (parental status), achieved status (education and prior occupational status) remains the most important factor accounting for the individual’s ultimate attained status. The study thus set the theoretical baseline for further modifications and expansions. All subsequent theoretical revisions and expansions must be evaluated for their contribution to the explanation of status attainment beyond those accounted for by the Blau–Duncan paradigm (Kelley 1990; Smith 1990). Several later lines of work, including the addition of sociopsychological variables (Sewell and Hauser 1975), the recasting of statuses as classes (Wright 1979; Goldthorpe 1980), the incorporation of「structural」entities and positions as both contributing and attained statuses (Baron and Bielby 1980; Kalleberg 1988), and the identification of comparative development or institutions as contingent conditions (Treiman 1970) have significantly amplified rather than altered the original Blau–Duncan conclusion concerning the relative merits of achieved versus ascribed personal resources in status attainment.

Social Capital and Status Attainment 79

In the last three decades, a research tradition has focused on the effects of social capital on attained statuses. The principal proposition is that social capital exerts an important and significant effect beyond that accounted for by personal resources. Systematic investigations of this proposition have included (1) developing theoretical explanations and hypotheses; (2) developing measurements for social capital; (3) conducting empirical studies verifying the hypotheses; and (4) assessing the relative importance of social resources compared to personal resources in the process of status attainment. These investigations have been carried out in North America, Europe, and Asia, in multiple political economies, and have involved scholars of many nations and cultures.

The accumulation of and advances in theory and research have considerably expanded the intellectual horizon of sociological analysis in status attainment, and thus in social stratification and social mobility. It probably also represents the most prominent research area where explicit, systematic application and analysis of the theory and methods of social capital for instrumental actions has occurred. To a great extent, this research tradition has directly contributed to the development of the theory of social capital itself.

The purposes of this chapter are to (1) review the theoretical and empirical foundations of these lines of investigation; (2) summarize sampled studies and results; and (3) propose issues and directions for future research. Before proceeding with these tasks, I wish to identify the limitations of this review. It will focus on social capital – embedded resources in the networks accessed and used to attain statuses; as such, it does not review the effects of properties of social networks per se (e.g., density, centrality, bridging) unless they implicate accessed resources (what influence these characteristics may exert on the access and use of embedded resources). Second, the outcome of this focus is the status attained rather than whether a job search is successful. The latter has a substantial literature of its own and is better summarized elsewhere (e.g., Granovetter 1995). This chapter will touch on aspects of job searches to the extent that they affect attained statuses. Finally, only the literature available in English will be reviewed. I am aware of an expanding literature in Europe, but unfortunately, my language limitations do not allow for coverage here.

Formative Studies and Theoretical Foundations Contributions of social network analysis to status attainment can be traced to the seminal study conducted by Mark Granovetter (1974), who interviewed 282 professional and managerial men in Newton,

80

Theory and Research

Massachusetts. The data suggested that those who used interpersonal channels seemed to land more satisfactory and better (e.g., higher-paid) jobs. Based on this empirical research and substantiated by a review of job-search studies, Granovetter proposed (1973) a network theory for information flow. The hypothesis of the strength of weak ties states that weaker ties tend to form bridges that link individuals to other social circles for information not likely to be available in their own circles, and such information should be useful to the individuals.2

However, Granovetter never suggests that access to or help from weaker rather than stronger ties would result in higher-status jobs thus obtained (1995, p. 148). Clues about the linkage between strength of ties and attained statuses came indirectly from a small world study conducted in a tri-city metropolitan area in upstate New York (Lin, Dayton, and Greenwald 1978). The task of the participants in the study was to forward packets containing information about certain target persons to others they knew on a first-name basis so that the packets might eventually reach the target persons. The study found that successful chains (those packets successfully forwarded to the targets) involved higher-status intermediaries until the last nodes (dipping down in the hierarchy toward the locations of the targets) compared to the unsuccessful chains.

Successful chains also implicated nodes that had more extensive social contacts (who claimed more social ties) and yet tended to forward the packets to someone they had not seen recently (weaker ties). The small world study thus made two contributions. First, it suggested that access to hierarchical positions might be the critical factor in the process of status attainment. Thus, the possible linkage between strength of ties and status attainment might be indirect: the strength of weak ties might lie in their accessing social positions higher in the social hierarchy, which have the advantage in facilitating instrumental action. Second, the study implicated behavior rather than a paper-and-pencil exercise, as each step in the packet-forwarding process required actual actions from each participant. Thus, the study results lend behavioral validity to the results of previous status attainment paper-and-pencil studies.

Based on these studies, a theory of social resources has emerged (Lin 1982, 1990). The theory begins with an image of the macrosocial structure consisting of positions ranked according to certain normatively 2 On the surface, this hypothesis might be seen as simply the inverse of the long-known hypothesis that stronger ties are formed among those who share similar characteristics and lifestyles, known as the homophily principle or the like-me hypothesis (Homans 1950; Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954; Laumann 1966; Lin 1982). What the strength-of-weak-ties argument contributed, however, was a challenge to the taken-for-granted and attributed value given to strong ties, or the homophily principle: strong ties, which promote group solidarity, are socially valuable. By shifting our attention to the weaker ties, Granovetter alerted us that weak ties, which promote access to different and new information, are socially valuable as well.

valued resources such as wealth, status, and power. This structure has a pyramidal shape in terms of accessibility and control of such resources: the higher the position, the fewer the occupants; and the higher the position, the better the view it has of the structure (especially down below).

The pyramidal structure suggests advantages for positions closer to the top, in terms of both number of occupants (fewer) and accessibility to positions (more). Within these structural constraints and opportunities, individuals act for expressive and instrumental purposes. For the latter (attaining status in the social structure being one prime example), the better strategy would be for ego to reach toward contacts higher up in the hierarchy. These contacts would be better able to exert influence on positions (e.g., a recruiter for a firm) whose actions might benefit ego’s interest. This reaching-up process might be facilitated if ego uses weaker ties, since these are more likely to reach out vertically (presumably upward) rather than horizontally relative to ego’s position in the hierarchy.

Three propositions have thus been formulated: (1) the social-resources proposition – social resources (e.g., resources accessed in social networks) exert influence on the outcome of an instrumental action (e.g., attained status), (2) the strength-of-position proposition – social resources, in turn, are affected by the original position of ego (as represented by parental resources or previous resources), and (3) the strength-of-ties proposition – social resources are also affected by the use of weaker rather than stronger ties.

Social Resources and Social Capital:

A Theoretical Convergence

This theoretical development occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when parallel but independent discussions on social capital (Bourdieu 1980, 1983/1986; Coleman 1988) were emerging as well. While social capital refers to a variety of features in the social structure, according to different scholars (e.g., community norms – Coleman 1990; group solidarity – Hechter 1983, Portes and Sensenbrenner 1993; participation in voluntary and civil organizations – Putnam 1995a, 1995b), it eventually became clear (Lin 1982, 1995a; Flap 1996; Tardos 1996; Burt 1997; Portes 1998) that social capital refers primarily to resources accessed in social networks. Further, the theory also focuses on the instrumental utility of such resources (capital as investment or mobilization). The convergence of the social resources and social capital theories complements and strengthens the development of a social theory focusing on the instrumental utility of accessed and mobilized resources embedded in social networks. It places the significance of social resources

82

Theory and Research

in the broader theoretical discussion of social capital and sharpens the definition and operationality of social capital as a research concept. The three propositions previously stated (i.e., social capital, strength of position, and strength of ties) remain valid in the framework of social capital, although other propositions have subsequently been proposed (see Chapter 5). The following discussion will reflect the merged notions of social capital and social resources and will examine the research conducted on the three propositions: (1) the social-capital proposition (Proposition 1 in Chapter 5): better embedded resources accessed in the social networks lead to better attained status; (2) the strength-of-position proposition (Proposition 2 in Chapter 5): the better the structural position of origin, the better the attained status; and (3) the strength-of-weak-ties proposition (Proposition 4 in Chapter 5): the weaker the ties, the better the attained status (in the instrumental action of a job search). At the empirical and research levels, social resources are used; at the general theoretical level, social capital is employed.

Research Models and Evidence

Research on the relationships between social resources and status attainment examines two processes, as illustrated in Figure 6.1. One process focuses on the access to social capital – resources accessed in the ego’s general social networks. In this process, human capital (education, experiences), initial positions (parental or prior job statuses), and ego’s social ties (e.g., extensity of ties) are hypothesized to determine the extent of resources the ego can access through such connections (network resources). Further, network resources, education, and initial positions are expected to affect attained statuses such as occupational status, authority positions, sectors, or earnings. We may describe this model as the accessed social capital model .

Another process focuses on the mobilization of social capital in the process of status attainment – the use of social contacts and the resources provided by the contact in the job-search process. As can be seen in Figure 6.1, contact status used is seen as the mobilized social capital in the status attainment process. It is hypothesized that contact status, along with education and initial positions, will exert a significant and important effect on the status of the job obtained. Contact status, in turn, is affected by education, network resources, and the tie strength between ego and the contact. Strength of ties may be measured either with a perceived strength (e.g., intimacy of the relationship) or with a role category (e.g., kin, friends, and acquaintances). We shall call this model the mobilized social capital model .

In both types of analysis, other factors may be added to the basic model, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, indications of job experience or tenure, the work sector, and the industry or organization, either as control variables or as opportunity/constraint factors. We turn now to a brief review of the literature, which will proceed first with the mobilized social capital model, as it received initial research attention, followed by the accessed social capital model and models incorporating both access and mobilization processes. A summary of the studies and findings appears in Table 6.1.

Social Capital and Status Attainment 85

Lin, Vaughn, and Ensel 1981). The study used data from a representative community sample in metropolitan Albany, New York, of more than 400 employed men, and confirmed that contact status exerted effects on attained status beyond and after accounting for parental status and education effects. It also confirmed that contact status was affected positively by the father’s status and negatively by the strength of ties between ego and the contact. The results provided the initial confirmation of all three propositions of the social capital theory. Ensel (1979) extended the investigation to both men and women in a study of employed adults in New York State. While confirming that contact status significantly affected attained status, he found that male contacts were much more likely to reach higher-status contacts than female contacts. Further, women were more likely to use female contacts in job searches, while men overwhelmingly used male contacts. When women did use male contacts, their disadvantage in reaching higher-status contacts as compared to men was significantly reduced. This study was one of the first to provide direct evidence that men, being positioned advantageously in the hierarchy, had better social capital than women. Secondly, women’s disadvantages in mobilizing male contacts, and thereby accessing better social capital, accounted in part for their inferior status attainment.

Further replication and extension of the model were done by Marsden and Hurlbert (1988), who analyzed the transition to current jobs for 456 men in the 1970 Detroit Area Study. This confirmed that contact status (occupational prestige and sector) exerted the strongest effects on attained prestige and sector, respectively. The authors also found that the contact’s prestige and position in the core sector were related to the prestige and sector of the prior job, respectively, confirming the strength-of-position proposition. On the other hand, the authors did not confirm the strength-of-tie proposition; contact status was not associated with the strength of ties between ego and the contact.

Extension of the model to other societies quickly followed. De Graaf and Flap (1988) lent further support to the social resources proposition in their analyses of 628 males in a 1980 West German survey and 466

males in a 1982 Dutch survey. They did not examine the strength-of-position or the strength-of-tie propositions for social resources. The Netherlands Family Survey of 1992 provided data on male–female com-anywhere from 20 percent to over 61 percent of the job seekers indicate the use of personal contacts (for a summary, see Granovetter 1995, pp. 139–141). Yet, studies of selectivity bias have revealed no major differences in the characteristics of those who used personal contacts compared to those who used formal channels or direct applications in job searches. Younger and less experienced workers do show a slightly greater tendency to use personal contacts. Thus, most studies have incorporated age and/or work experience as controls to account for possible bias.

parisons in the social capital effect. Moerbeek, Ultee, and Flap (1995) used father’s occupation as the indicator of social capital when the father was mentioned as the social contact, and found that it exerted a positive and significant effect on the statuses of first and current/last jobs for both men and women. Wegener (1991) analyzed a 1987 data set from Germany of 604 men and women aged forty-two and thirty-two, and found that contact status significantly affected the prestige of the job found, confirming the social resources proposition. However, the strength-of-ties proposition and the strength-of-position hypotheses were not examined. Barbieri (1996), reporting a study of 500 newly hired persons in the administrative area of Milan, Italy, confirmed the social-resources proposition by finding that contact status significantly affected present job status, having already accounted for effects from father’s status, education, and first and previous job statuses. Further, he found that father’s status indirectly affected contact status through education, lending some support to the strength-of-tie proposition. When Barbieri subdivided the sample into those who used strong versus weak ties, he found no advantage of using weaker ties in the association between contact status and attainted status. In fact, there was some evidence that stronger ties increased the association between contact status and statuses of first and previous jobs. Requena’s (1991) study in Spain provided the only disconfirming evidence for the social resources proposition, as it showed that greater social resources did not provide better jobs, even though they did affect income attainment. He speculated that the lack of social-resources effects was due in part to the rigid bureau-cratization of Spain’s employment policies and practices.

Systematic tests of the theory have been carried out in Asia as well. A series of studies were conducted by Hsung and others in Taiwan, which is also a capitalist state. One study (Hsung and Sun 1988) surveyed the labor force in the manufacturing industry, and another (Hsung and Hwang 1992) examined the labor force in a metropolitan area (Taichung). Both studies supported the social resources proposition that contact status significantly affects the status of obtained first and current jobs after accounting for father’s education and occupational status, education, and, in the case of the current job, prior job status. Hsung and Hwang (1992) also found modest support for the strength-of-position argument, but father’s education and occupational status had only a modest effect on contact status for the first job and no significant effects on the current job’s contact status. For strength of ties, a composite measure (closeness with contacts, frequency of visits, frequency of calls, and content of the relationship) indicated only a slightly negative relationship with the first job’s contact status and no relationship with the current job’s contact status. In addition, in 1994, Bian and Ang (1997)

Social Capital and Status Attainment 87

conducted a study of 512 men and women in Singapore that strongly confirmed the social resources proposition: contact status significantly affected obtained status. Helper status was strongly related to the current job’s occupational status, along with age, education, and prior job status.

For all respondents, weaker ties reached higher-status contacts. However, the weakest ties (not intimate at all) had no effect on contact status, a finding similar to that of a 1988 Tianjin study that will be described shortly. For those who reached helpers indirectly, the association between tie strength and contact status was negative. However, stronger ties between the intermediary and the helper were more likely to result in reaching a higher-status helper.

A major extension of the research paradigm has examined the propositions in different political economies, such as state socialism. Bian (1997), in a 1988 study conducted in Tianjin, China, including 1,008

men and women, found that helper’s job status (measured by the hierarchical level of his or her work unit) was strongly associated with attained work unit status in the job change, along with education and prior job status. The overall effect of the tie strength between ego and the helper on the helper’s status was insignificant. Further analyses showed that medium-strength ties reached helpers with better status; this was true for the tie strength between ego and intermediaries, as well as between intermediaries and helpers. Moreover, in a retrospective panel study conducted by Volker and Flap (1999) in Leipzig and Dresden, two cities in the former German Democratic Republic, the occupational prestige of the contact person had strong and significant effects on both the first job and job prestige in 1989. Thus, the social resources proposition was confirmed. However, strength of ties (measured by the intensity of the relationship between ego and the contact) had no effect on contact statuses or on attained occupational status and income. Neither father’s education nor occupational prestige affected contact status for the 1989

job search. However, education had a significant effect on contact status.

Since the father’s status had direct effects on education, these results confirmed the indirect effect of the strength of positions, mediated through education.

Accessed Social Capital

Two methods are used to measure accessed social capital: name generators and position generators. The name generator method is the more common method and has been used extensively in the network literature. The general technique is to pose one or more questions about ego’s contacts in certain role relationships (e.g., neighborhood, work), content areas (e.g., work matters, household chores), or intimacy (e.g., confi-

dential, most intimate interactions). Such questions generate a list of contacts ranging from three to five or as many as volunteered by ego. From these lists, relationships between ego and contacts, and among contacts, as well as contacts’ characteristics, are generated. Social capital measures are constructed to reflect the contacts’ diversity and range of resources (education, occupation) as well as characteristics (gender, race, age).

There are a number of problems associated with the use of name generators to measure social capital, including variations in distributions being affected by the content or role and number of names. As a result, the data tend to reflect stronger ties, stronger role relations, or geographically limited ties (Campbell and Lee 1991).

Position generators , first proposed by Lin and associates (Lin and Dumin 1986), use a sample of structural positions that are salient in a society (occupations, authorities, work units, class, or sector) and ask respondents to indicate contacts (e.g., those known on a first-name basis), if any, in each of the positions. In addition, relationships between ego and the contact for each position can be identified. Thus, instead of sampling content or role areas, the position generator samples hierarchical positions. It is content free and role/location neutral. Instead of counting and measuring data from specific names (persons) generated, the position generator counts and measures access to structural positions.

An example of the position-generator instrument is shown in Table 6.2.

The name-generator methodology has been employed in research over a longer period of time, while the position-generator methodology has emerged in more recent studies. The following section will report on the studies and results for each methodology on accessed social capital and status attainment.

Social Capital and Status Attainment 89

Name-Generators Studies. Campbell, Marsden, and Hurlbert (1986) examined the associations between network resources and socioeconomic statuses with name-generator data from the 1965–1966 Detroit Area Study and found that the resource compositions of networks (mean and maximal education, mean and maximal prestige) were significantly associated with attained statuses such as occupational prestige and family income. In the Milan study, Barbieri (1996) also constructed three measures for social capital from name-generator data and found them to affect present job status after accounting for parental statuses, experience, human capital (years of schooling), and first and previous job statuses. Further, social capital was affected by father’s status, confirming the strength-of-position proposition.

Several studies have assessed the associations between accessed social capital and attained statuses among certain labor populations. Access to social capital by the unemployed was the focus of a study conducted by Sprengers, Tazelaar, and Flap (1988). Among a group of 242 Dutch men aged forty to fifty-five who were unemployed in or before 1978, those with better social capital were more likely to find jobs within a year after unemployment, especially those with access to social capital through weak ties. Those with better social capital did not find a better occupational status or a higher income when they found reemployment.

However, better social capital increased optimism about job opportunities, which in turn increased the intensity of the job search, leading to more and better jobs. Further, it was found that the more restricted the labor market, the more intense those with greater social capital tended to be in job searches. After a year of unemployment, those with better social capital among strong ties (relatives) also tended to have a better chance of being rehired in the next one to three years. The study also found that those with better education, former occupations, and higher incomes also tended to have better social capital, confirming the strength-of-position hypothesis. Focusing on 1,359 top managers of large companies in the Netherlands, Boxman, De Graaf, and Flap (1991) found that both education and social capital (measured with work contacts in other organizations and membership in clubs and professional associations) had direct effects on income. The job-search activities of 365

persons in the Netherlands who finished vocational training were also studied by Boxman and Flap (1990) in 1989. Data were obtained from job seekers and employers, as well as from contacts used by the job seekers. Preliminary analyses showed that for income, the more important predictors were gender (in favor of men), social capital, career perspective, and company-specific skills.

Early promotion and better bonuses were the outcomes assessed by Burt (1992) for managers in a large electronic components and com-

puting equipment firm. Using the extent to which each ego was embedded in a constrained network (fewer contacts, more dense relations, and more contacts related to a single contact) as a measure of social capital, he found that there was a negative association between structural constraints and early promotion. That is, he suggested that access to diverse resources in one’s networks enhanced the opportunity to locate useful information and influence for promoting one’s position in the firm. For men in senior positions in the investment banking division of a large American financial organization, a similar negative association between constrained networks and bonuses was found (Burt 1997).

Position-Generators Studies. Lin and Dumin (1986) analyzed the data from an Albany, New York, study in which twenty occupations were sampled from the U.S. 1960 census listing of occupations, with all occupations ranked according to job prestige scores. At equal intervals on the job prestige scale scores, occupations were identified. From this group, the most popular (frequency of occupants) occupation was selected. Each respondent was asked if he had any contact (person he knew on a first-name basis) in each of the positions. If more than one contact was indicated, the respondent was asked to focus on the most familiar one. For each accessed position, the respondent identified the contact’s relationship (relative, friend, or acquaintance). From the data matrix, Lin and Dumin constructed two social resources access measures: the highest status accessible (the position accessed with the highest prestige score) and the range of statuses accessed (the difference between the highest and lowest accessed statuses). Analyses showed that the two measures were positively and significantly related to current occupational status.

Further analysis showed that respondents’ original positions (father’s occupational prestige score or white–blue and high–low occupational groupings) and these two measures were positively and significantly related, confirming the strength-of-position hypothesis. When Lin and Dumin analyzed the relationships between the three types of ties (relatives, friends, acquaintances) and the access variables, they found that friends as well as acquaintances provided the best access to both the highest-status position and the range of accessed statuses.

Hsung and Hwang (1992) also incorporated network resources in their Taichung study, as cited earlier. Adapting the position-generator methodology with twenty occupations, they failed to find significant effects for the highest status accessed and for the difference between the lowest and highest occupational statuses accessed. However, they did find significant effects on the first job status of a measure of the「total amount of network resources,」which was based on the sum status scores of all occupations accessed. This measure, however, did not have any

Social Capital and Status Attainment 91

effect on current job status. Volker and Flap (1999), in their Germany study, used the position-generator methodology to ask respondents to identify, among thirty-three occupations, whether they knew anyone in any of the occupations, and if so, what their relationships were (relatives, friends, and acquaintances). For 1989 occupational status, the effect of the highest status accessed was positive and significant, controlling for fathers’ education and occupation, the respondents’ own education and sex, and the prestige of their first job. This variable also had a positive and moderately significant ( p < .10) effect on 1989 income when 1989 occupational prestige was added to the equation along with all other independent variables. This result confirmed the social resources proposition. Further, Volker and Flap found that both relatives and acquaintances accessed better occupations (upper-white-collar or higher prestige) than friends. On the other hand, acquaintances accessed a greater range (the difference between the highest- and lowest-prestige jobs) of occupations than either relatives or friends. Since the highest occupational prestige accessed turned out to be the best predictor of attained status, the effects of weak ties were not found (as relatives and acquaintances were almost equally likely to access high-prestige occupations). The father’s occupational prestige was positively related to the highest occupational prestige accessed in general, as well as for each group of occupations accessed through relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Thus, the strength-of-position proposition was confirmed. In pre-1989 Hungary (1987–1988), Angelusz and Tardos (1991) also used the position generator to identify「weakly tied」relations or resources. This variable was found to be significantly associated with wages, after accounting for the effects of sex, education, residence, and age.

In her study of the private security industry (161 guard, investigation, and security companies) in Toronto in 1991–1992, Erickson (1995, 1996) used Wright’s (1979) class dimensions (control of property, control of organizations, and control of skill) to select nineteen job positions.

Data were gathered from 155 employees, 46 supervisors, 80 managers, and 112 owners. Erickson found that social capital (diversity in accessing various positions) contributed to job autonomy and authority, which in turn generated better job returns. The major conclusions are that (1) accessed social capital helps people to rise to higher positions (in comparisons between mangers versus lower-level employees and owners versus employees) and (2) social capital pays off even if people do not use a contact to get a job (see Recruitment and Social Capital in the next section). In another study on social capital, Erickson (1998) differentiated two types of social capital: global and local. Local settings refer to geographic areas (neighborhoods), ethnic areas (ethnic communities and enclave economies), or organizations (schools, voluntary organizations,

Theory and Research

social movements, or firms). In a telephone survey of 352 participants in the Toronto Local Employment and Trading System (LETS), Erickson asked the respondents to identify contacts in a list of thirty occupations both inside and outside the LETS system. Analyses showed that local social capital was associated with income in the LETS system (the local economy), while global social capital was not associated with income in the general economy, pointing to the fact that social capital’s effect is more contingent in the global economy system.

Joint Effects of Accessed and Mobilized Social Capital Since there are two types of social capital in the process of status attainment, a logical step would be to examine accessed and mobilized social capital in a single study. The theoretical question posed is the extent to which accessed social capital facilitates social capital: that is, whether having more accessed social capital increases the likelihood of mobilizing better social capital. The structural opportunity and advantage implied in this hypothesis is apparent. However, it is also to be expected that the correspondence will not be overwhelming: not all persons accessed with rich social capital are expected to take advantage of or be able to mobilize social capital for the purpose of obtaining better socioeconomic status. An element of action and choice should also be significant. Several studies have lent support to this hypothesis.

For example, in their study of vocational training graduates, Boxman and Flap (Boxman 1992; Flap and Boxman 1996) showed that contact status (mobilized social capital) affects attained occupational status, whereas accessed social capital does not. The Germany study (Volker and Flap 1996) is another study in which both accessed and mobilized social capital were measured. It was found that the highest occupational prestige accessed using the position-generator methodology was significantly and positively related to the status of the contact person used in the 1989 job search, but its direct effect on 1989 job prestige, while positive, was only modest in significance ( p < .10). The contact person’s prestige had a much stronger effect. In fact, its direct effect on 1989 job prestige was stronger than education once the prestige of the first job was also incorporated (and was the most significant predictor).

Lai, Lin, and Leung (1998) also examined the joint effects of accessed and mobilized social capital on status attainment using the Albany data (Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981). Incorporating both the network resources measures from the position generator (Lin and Dumin 1986) and the contact resources (contact status in the job search) in structural equation models, they showed that current job status is significantly and directly affected by education (achieved status) and by contact status.

Social Capital and Status Attainment 93

Contact status, in turn, is affected by parental statuses (ascribed status), education, network resources, and weaker ties with the contact. Thus, it is clear that mobilized social capital directly influences status outcome and mobilized social capital is affected by accessed social capital, along with ascribed and achieved statuses.

Issues and Research Directions

Research has provided consistent support for the proposition that social capital, in the form of social resources, makes a significant contribution to status attainment beyond personal resources. This association persists across societies (different nation-states and political economies), industrialization and development levels, labor market populations (recent graduates, new hires, job changers), different economic sectors (industries, organizations, positions in organizations), and status outcomes (occupation, authority, sector, promotion, bonuses). The association remains significant across differential conceptualization (accessed versus mobilized capital) and measurement (name generators versus position generators). Yet, there remain important issues to be conceptualized and studied in the future. In the following subsections, a number of these issues will be briefly identified and discussed.

Informal and Formal Job Search Channels

It is clear by now that the use of informal channels by itself offers no advantage over other channels, especially formal channels, in attained status. In fact, if anything, informal channels tend to be used by the disadvantaged: women, the less educated, and the less skilled. The statuses attained therefore tend to be lower. Yet, among those who use informal channels, social resources (contact statuses) make a major difference.

Several issues remain. First, is it really true that the advantaged do not need to use informal channels, as they possess greater human capital and can apply directly to high-status positions? The evidence is mixed. For some jobs that have specific requirements (dealing with technology and hardware, for example), credentials regarding skills and training in the formal application may be sufficient to obtain positions. However, for other critical jobs (high-level managerial and human-interfaced positions), formal credentials are often insufficient to convey the social skills and resources so essential for occupants’ performances. The necessary informal or shadow channels through which such information is conveyed, yet not detected in survey instruments, remain an important methodological challenge. Secondly, for the disadvantaged, social capital

94

Theory and Research

is restricted (the strength-of-position argument). Within this restricted range of resources, there is little information on whether the disadvantaged are also less likely to mobilize the optimal resources available to them, thus creating double jeopardy. Knowledge about the choice behaviors of the advantaged and the disadvantaged will be helpful in sorting through the structural constraints and choice constraints.

Strength of Ties or Network Locations?

While the social resources proposition and the strength-of-position propositions have been consistently confirmed (see Table 6.1), much ambiguity has resulted regarding the strength-of-ties proposition.

Strength of ties in and of itself should not be expected to exert a direct effect on status outcomes (Granovetter 1995), and much research evidence points to the absence of a direct association (e.g., Bridges and Villemez 1986; Marsden and Hurlbert 1988; Forse 1997). The modified proposition that weaker ties might access better social resources also lacks consistent empirical support (see Table 6.1). Yet, social capital is theorized to contain both structural effects and agency effects; further specifications of network or tie choices within structural constraints may eventually turn out to be meaningful. Several lines of investigation have provided some leads. For example, it has been argued that the effect of strength of ties on social resources accessed or mobilized may be contingent on the original status. Some studies have pointed to the ceiling effect of tie strength: at or near the top level of the hierarchy, it is strong ties that tend to yield successful job attainment (Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981; Erickson 1995, 1996). Also, the weakest ties are clearly not useful (Bian 1997; Bian and Ang 1997), since ties with no strength offer no incentive for exchanges. On the other hand, the strongest ties, by the same token, may be useful despite the restricted range of resources accessed. There ties, by definition, represent commitment, trust, and obligation and therefore the motivation to help. Willingness and effort to search for other ties using these strong ties may be critical under institutional uncertainties or constraints (e.g., under state socialism: Rus 1995, Bian 1997; or tight market situations: Sprengers, Tazelaar, and Flap 1988). Organizational constraints and opportunities may also condition the relative utility of weaker or stronger ties (Lin 1990).

Another source of possible clarification suggests a possible modification in the conceptualization of the strength of ties in network terms.

For example, strength of tie may be reflected in the length of the links between ego and the alter whose resources are eventually accessed. If each link is assumed to be of equal strength, then the strength of the tie between ego and the alter may become an inverse function of the length

Social Capital and Status Attainment 95

of the links between them: the longer the chain of connection, the weaker the tie. While the multiple links necessarily weaken the degree of obligations, trust, and reciprocity between ego and the ultimate alter, such a chain also extends the reach for resources not present in the proximal areas of ego in the networks. To the extent that heterogeneous or rich resources are present in distant parts of the network, the chain length or weaker ties may in fact become useful. Further analysis along this line (e.g., Bian 1997) will clarify the utility of both the bridge effect and the strength-of-tie effect.

Other considerations point to locations in the social networks. The utility of social ties may be more dependent on the locations of the actors in the social networks or on the hierarchical structure rather than the strength of ties (e.g., Lin and Dumin 1986; Angelusz and Tardos 1991; Burt 1997). Positions at or near strategic locations, such as bridges or structural holes, may provide a competitive advantage to actors accessing heterogeneous and thus rich resources.

These findings and considerations have led to further articulation of the propositions for the theory of social capital, as reflected in Chapter 5, where network positions, in conjunction with structural positions, provide the key to predict how likely an instrumental action is to lead to better social capital.

Further Development of the Position Generator In order to ascertain the causal sequence, the time framework of the contacts needs to be specified. For example, the generator may wish to ask,

「When you were looking for the first (or current) job, did you know of anyone who had this kind of work?」Also, it is important to sample the positions from a meaningful hierarchy in a given society. In addition to occupational status or prestige, work units, sectors, authority, or autonomy may confer important statuses in certain societies. Catering to the significance of meaningful statuses/classes in a given society is thus an important consideration in identifying the positions in the generators (Erickson 1995).

Inequality of Social Capital

Differential access to social capital deserves much greater research attention. It is conceivable that social groups (gender, race) have different access to social capital because of their advantaged or disadvantaged structural positions and social networks. Thus, for example, inequality of social capital offers fewer opportunities for women and minorities to mobilize better social resources to attain and promote careers. For the

96

Theory and Research

disadvantaged to gain a better status, strategic behaviors require accessing resources beyond their usual social circles (e.g., women) using male ties (Ensel 1979) to find sponsors in the firm (Burt 1998) and to join clubs dominated by men (Beggs and Hurlbert 1997); or for blacks to find ties outside their own neighborhood or those employed (Green, Tigges, and Browne 1995); or for scholars of Mexican origin to find ties of non-Mexican origin or to establish ties with institutional agents such as teachers and counselors (Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch 1995; Stanton-Salazar 1997). Systematic data on inequalities in social capital will provide an explanatory framework for inequality in social stratification and mobility and offer behavioral choices to overcome such inequalities.

The next chapter, in fact, will describe one such effort.

Recruitment and Social Capital

The relationships between social capital and status attainment apply to both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. So far, research literature has primarily concentrated on the supply side – the status attainment process from job seekers’ perspective. The demand side of the model – the recruitment process from the organization’s perspective –

has only begun to emerge (Boxman and Flap 1990; Boxman, De Graaf and Flap 1991; Erickson 1995, 1996; Burt 1997; Fernandez and Weinberg 1997). There are reasons to believe that social capital is important for firms in selective recruitment, as firms must operate in an environment where social skills and networks play critical roles in transactions and exchanges. This is especially true of certain types of positions. Thus, we may anticipate that certain positions require more social capital than other positions in a firm. First, top-level executives are expected to possess rich social capital, as they need to deal with and manage people both within and outside the firm. In fact, we may postulate that at the highest level of management, social capital far outweighs human capital for occupants. Thus, it can be hypothesized that firms such as IBM and Microsoft are more likely to recruit experienced managers with social skills rather than computer expertise for their CEOs, and that top universities need presidents who have the social skills to negotiate with faculty, students, parents, and alumni, and to raise funds rather than produce distinguished scholarships. Second, we should expect positions that deal with persons (e.g., nurses) rather than machines or technologies (e.g., programmers) to be filled with occupants who have better social capital. Third, positions at the edge of the firm are more likely to be filled by those with better social capital than others (e.g., salesperson, public relations personnal, or managers at remote sites; Burt 1997).

Firms with more needs for such positions, therefore, should be expected

Social Capital and Status Attainment 97

to use informal sources in recruitment more extensively. Such hypotheses will help empirical specifications and testing.

Social Capital versus Human Capital

The relationship between social capital and human capital is theoretically important. Some scholars (Bourdieu 1983/1986; Coleman 1990) have proposed that social capital helps produce human capital. Well-connected parents and social ties can indeed enhance the opportunities for individuals to obtain better education, training, and skill and knowledge credentials. On the other hand, it is clear that human capital induces social capital. Better-educated and better-trained individuals tend to move in social circles and clubs rich in resources. The harder question is: given both, which is more important in enhancing status attainment?

Several studies cited in this chapter suggest that social capital may be as important as or even more important than human capital (education and work experience) in status attainment (Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn 1981; Marsden and Hurlbert 1988), while others show the opposite (Hsung and Sun 1988; DeGraaf and Flap 1988; Hsung and Hwang 1992). Industrialization probably is not the explanation, as the former group includes studies conducted in the United States and the latter in the Netherlands and Taiwan. More likely, there is an association between specific educational institutions and methods of job allocations and searches. As Krymkowski (1991) showed in a comparative analysis of data from the United States, West Germany, and Poland in the 1970s, both West Germany and Poland showed stronger associations between social origins and education and between education and occupational allocations than the United States. Yet, there is no clear evidence that the educational system in Taiwan resembles the West German and Dutch systems more than it does the U.S. system. The contrasting results from these countries thus remain to be explained.

Still more intriguing are the possible interactions between human capital and social capital. Boxman, De Graaf, and Flap (1991) found that human capital had its greatest effect on income when social capital was low, and human capital had its least effect on income when social capital was high. Further, in the study of Dutch managers, Flap and Boxman (1998) found that for top managers, social capital led to higher income at all levels of human capital, but the returns on human capital decreased at higher levels of social capital. If these patterns can be confirmed, they would suggest that human capital supplements social capital in status attainment. That is, when social capital is high, attained status will be high, regardless of the level of human capital; and when social capital is low, human capital exerts a strong effect on attainment. or, given certain minimal levels of human and social capital, social capital is the more important factor in accounting for status attainment.

Concluding Remarks

This brief chapter can only provide an abbreviated presentation of the rich and sizable research literature on social capital and status attainment. Many studies are currently being conducted in many parts of the world and have not been covered here. Nevertheless, it should be apparent that this research tradition has contributed significantly to the development of the social capital theory itself, as well as providing detailed and varied empirical data for its verification and continuous evolution.

The research enterprise truly exemplifies the importance and fruitfulness of the continuing interplay and reciprocal feedback between theory and research.


## 06

这

章介绍一个理论传统，它反映了我们所提出的社会资本与工具性

行动之间的联系。特别地，它调査研究了社会资本如何增加了找到好工作的机会。因此，它属于通常我们所知道的地位获得过程（status attainment process）的研究范式。

地位获得可以理解为，个体为获得社会经济地位上的回报而进行资源动

员与投资的过程。理解和评价地位获得过程的理论和经验文献，可以追溯到布劳与邓肯的开创性研究（Blau 和 Duncan,1967)。他们的主要结论是，即使考虑到先赋地位（父母地位）的直接和间接影响，自致地位（教育和先前的职业地位）仍然是解释个体最后所获地位的最重要因素。他们的研究为理论的进一步发展奠定了基础。此后要评价某一理论修正和扩展对地位获得研究的贡献，都必须考虑它们对布劳一邓肯范式有哪些超越（Kly,1990 Smith, 1990。后来几个研究思路，包括社会心理学変量的加（Sewell and Hauser, 1975），阶级地位的重塑（Wright,1979; Goldthorpe,1980），促进地位获得的「结构」实体与位置因素的加（Baron and Bielby,1980; Kalleberg,1988），对比较发展的确认（comparative development）或作为偶然条件的制度因素的肯定（Treiman,1970），都大大地扩展而不是改変了布芳一邓肯的最初结论一一在地位获得中，自致对先赋的个人资源的相对优势。

在过去的 30 年里，究传统已经开始关注社会资本对地位获得的影响。基本的命题是，社会资本对地位获得的重要的影响，超越了个人资源

[1] 这一章的大部分经同意选自 Lin（1999b）。



所能解释的。对这个命题的系统的调査研究包括：(1）发展理论解释与假设；(2）发展社会资本的测量方法；(3）进行证明假设的经验研究；(4）评价地位获得过程中，社会资源相对于个人资源的重要性。这些调査研究已经在北美、欧洲和亚洲的多种政治经济体中展开，并且吸引了很多国家和文化的学者参与进来。理论与研究的积累和进展，已经在地位获得和社会流动与分层上大大扩展了社会学分析的视野。它可能也代表了最突出的研究领域，在这里社会资本的理论与方法对工具性行动的详尽的、系统的应用和分析已经形成。在很大程度上，这个研究传统已经直接促进了社会资本理论本身的发展。

这一章的目的是：(1）回顾这些调査研究思路的理论与经验基础；(2）总结用抽样方法进行的研究与结论；(3）提出将来研究的问题和方向。在开始这些工作之前，我想指出这个回顾的局限。它将关注社会资本一为了获得地位而获取和使用的嵌人在网络中的资源，因此，它不考察社会网络本身属性（如紧密度、向心性、桥梁位置）的影响，除非它们涉及到资源的获取（那些影响这些特征的属性可能影响嵌入性资源的获取和使用产生）。这里关注的是地位获得，而不是找工作是否成功。后者已经形成了大量文献，并且得到了很好的总结（如 Granovetter,1995)。这一章只是在涉及到地位获得的意义上触及到找工作方面。最后，我只回顾可以获得的英文文献。我知道关于这方面的欧洲文献不断增加，但遗憾的是，我的语言约束不允许我涵盖它们。

形成的研究与理论的基础

社会网络分析对地位获得的贡献，可以追溯到格拉诺维特所进行的开创性研究（Gmanovetter,1974），他访谈了马萨诸塞州牛顿市（Nwon, Massachusetts）的 282 名男性专业和管理人员。数据显示，那些使用人际关系渠道的人似乎得到了更满意、更好的（如高薪）的工作。在这个经验研究的基础之上，格拉诺维特又回顾了关于找工作的研究，于 1973 年提出了信息流动的网络理论。弱关系强度假设指出，弱关系往往把个体与其他社会圈子连接起来形成桥

梁，从中得到的信息是不可能在自己的圈子里获得的，这些信息对个体是有用的。

然而，格拉诺维特从来没有指出，对弱关系的接触或者从弱关系（而不是强关系）中获得帮助，会导致人们获得更高的工作地位（Granovetter,1995,

-148)。关于关系强度与地位获得之间联系的线索，间接地来自对组约州北

部三连城（frip-city）都市地区的一个「小小世界」的研究（in, Dayton and

Greenwald,1978)。研究要求参与者将含有某些目标者（target person）信息的包裹，通过让熟人转交的方式，使包裹最后到达目标者手中。研究发现，与不成功的链条相比，成功的链条（那些包被成功地转交给目标者）中含有段从较高地位的中间人到最后的节点的过程（在等级中朝着目标者的位置下降）。成功的链条也涉及到有更广泛的社会联系的节点（那些声称有更多的社会关系的人），以及往往把包亵转交给他们最近没有看到的人（弱关系）的节点。这个「小小世界」的研究有两个贡献。首先，它意味着，对等级制位置的利用可能是地位获得过程中的关键因素。因此，关系强度与地位获得之间的联系可能是间接的：弱关系的有利之处可能在于它们接触的社会位置在社会等级制中更高，这便利了工具性行动。第二，研究涉及到的是行为，而不是「纸上谈兵」，在包裹转交过程中的每一步都需要每一个参与者的实际行动。因此，这个研究结果为以前问卷式的地位获得研究提供了行为的有效性。

建立在这些研究基础上的社会资源理论出现了（in,1982,1990 这个理论首先是一个由位置组成的宏观结构的形象，这些位置根据某些规范性的价值资源，如财富、地位和权力而排列。这个结构在资源的可获取性与控制方面形成了金字塔形状：位置越高，占据者越少；位置越高，具有的结构视

2] 表面上看，这个假设只是很早就为人所知的强关系假设的颠倒，强关系在那些共享相似的特征和生活方式的人当中形成，也即有名的同质原则或似我假设（like-me hypothesis）(Homans,1950; Lazarsfeld 和 Merton,1954; Laumann1966Lin,1982)。弱关系强度观点的贡献在于，它挑战了人们想当然地认为强关系或同质原则所具有的属性：强关系促进了群体团结，具有社会性价值。格拉诺维特把我们的注意力引向弱关系，提醒我们弱关系促进了对不同的和新的信息的获取，也是有社会性价值的。

野越好（特别是向下看）。金字塔结构中靠近顶部的位置具有优势，那里的占据者数量更少，可接触的位置更多。在这些结构性的约与机会范围内，个体为了表达性和工具性的目的而行动。对于工具性行动（获得社会结构地位是一个主要的例子），好的策略会使自我接触到等级地位更高的关系。这些关系能够很好地对位置（如一个公司的招聘人员）施加影响，从而有利于自我的利益。如果使用弱关系，有助于接触上面的位置，因为相对于自我在等级制中的位置，这些弱关系更可能是纵向的（可能向上）而不是横向的延伸。

我们再次阐述前面章节已经提出的三个命题：(1）社会资源命题社会资源（如在社会网络中获取的资源）对工具性行动（如地位获得）有影响；(2）地位强度命题一一社会资源反过来被自我的初始位置（可以由父母的资源或先前的资源来代表）所影响；(3）关系强度命题社会资源被弱关系而不是强关系的使用所影响。

社会资源与社会资本：理论的融合

社会资源理论的发展发生在 20 世纪 70 年代晚期和 80 年代早期，那时与此并列但独立的关于社会资本的讨论（Bourdieu,1980,1983/1986; Coleman,1988）也正在出现。虽然不同学者用社会资本来指称社会结构的不同特征（如，社会规范 Coleman,199 群体团结 Hechter,1983, Portes 和 Sensenbrenner,1993; 自愿性与公民性组织的参与 - Putnam,1995a,1995b），但是最后变得很清楚（in,1982,1995a; Fap,199; Tardos,1996Burt,199 Portes,198）：社会资本主要指从社会网络中获取的资源。此外，理论也关注这些社会资源的工具性效用（作为投资或动员的资本）。社会资源与社会资本理论相互融合相互补充，将关注点放在获取和动员的社会嵌入性资源的工具性效用上，从而促进了社会理论的发展。它将社会资源的意义置于社会资本的更广泛的理论讨论中，加强了社会资本概念的定义与可操作性。尽管后来其他的命题被提出来（参见第五章），前面陈述的三个命题（即社会资本、地位强度和关系强度），在社会资本框架内仍然有效。下面的讨论反映了社会资源相融合的思想，并对围

绕三个命题所进行的研究进行检验：(1）社会资本命题（第五章的命题 1）：在社会网络中获取的好的嵌人性资源，会导致好的地位获得；(2）地位强度命题（第五章的命题 2）：初始的结构性位置越好，获得的地位越好；(3）弱关系强度命题（第五章的命题 4）：关系越弱，获得的地位越好（在找工作的工具性行动中）。在经验和研究层次上，使用社会资源的概念；在一般的理论层次上，使用社会资本的概念。

研究模型和证据

关于社会资源与地位获得之间关系的研究要检验两个过程，如图 6.1 所示。一个过程关注社会资本的获取一一自我在一般的社会网络中所获取的资源。在这个过程中，假设人力资本（教育、经历）、初始位置（父母的或先前的职业地位）和自我的社会关系（如关系的广泛性），决定了自我通过这些联系（网络资源）可以获取的资源范围。而且，我认为网络资源、教育和初始位置会影响到获得的地位，如职业地位、权威地位、部门或收入。我们可以将这个模型描述为社会资本的获取模型。

另一个过程关注地位获得过程中的社会资本的动员一一在找工作过程中，使用社会交往者（contact）及其所提供的资源。从图 61 中可以看到，使用的交往者的地位被视为地位获得过程中所动员的社会资本。假设交往者地位连同教育和初始位置，将对职业地位获得施加重要的影响，交往者地位，反过来被教育、网络资源以及自我与交往者之间的关系强度所影响。关系强度可以用感受强度（perceived strength)（如关系的亲密度）或角色类型（role category（如亲属、朋友和熟人）来测量。我们将这个模型称为社会资本的动员模型。

在两类分析中，其他因素可以作为控制变量或机会 / 约束因素加人到这 个基本模型中，包括年龄、性别、种族 / 族群、工龄或任期、工作部门以及 行业或组织。现在，我们简短地回顾一下文献。首先从社会资本动员模型开始，因为它先受到研究的关注，然后回社会资本的获取模型与获取一动员的联合模型。研究和发现的总结在表 6.1 中。表 6.1 对社会资本与地位获得的研究和发现的总结

动员的社会资本

最先对社会资本动员模型进行经验检验的是林南和他的同事（Lin,

Ensel and Vaughn,1981; in, Vaughn and Ensel,1981)。研究使用的数据，来自纽

约州奥尔巴尼都市地区的 400 多名男性雇员所组成的典型社区样本。研究证

实，在考虑了父母地位与教育的影响之后，交往者的地位对地位获得具有影

响。研究也证实了交往者的地位受到父亲地位的正向影响，而受到自我与交

往者之间的关系强度的负向影响。这个研究最先证实了社会资本理论的所有三个命题。恩赛尔（Ensel,1979）在纽约州成年雇员的一个研究中，将调査范围扩展到女性。他在证实交往者地位对地位获得有显著性影响的同时，发现男性交往者比女性交往者更可能接触到更高地位的交往者。此外，女性在求职中更可能使用女性交往者，而男性则绝大多数地使用了男性交往者。当女性确实使用男性交往者时，她们在接触更高地位交往者中的不利显著降低了。这个研究证实了男性处在等级制中的优势位置，比女性拥有更好的社会资本，是最先提供直接证据的研究之ー。其次，女性在动员男性交往者和在获取好的社会资本中的不利，部分地解释了她们在地位获得中的劣势。马斯顿（Marsden）和赫尔伯特（Hurlbert,198）通过分析 1970 年底特律地区的研究中 456 位男性最近一次换工作的过程，再次复现并进步扩展了这个模型。这证实了交往者地位（职业声望与部门）分别对获得的声望与部门施加最强的影响。他们也发现，在核心部门的交往者的声望与位置分別与先前工作的声望与部门相关，从而证实了地位强度命题。

[3] 这个估计程序只是研究了在求职中使用个人关系的劳动力人ロ的一个子样本，这事实引起了对估计的选择偏差的关注。据显示，在社区劳动力人口调査中，每地都有从 20% 到超过 61% 的求职者承认使用了个人关系（参见 Granovetter,1995, Pp139-141 的总结）。然而，选择偏差的研究经揭示，那些在求职中使用个人关系者，与那些使用正式渠道或直接申请者相比，在特征上并不存在主要差别。年轻的和缺少经验的工人，在使用 个人关系上显示出略明显的倾向。因此，大多数研究已经纳人年岭和 / 或工岭的控制变量，以解释可能出现的偏差。



但是，他们没有证实关系强度命题交往者的地位同自我与交往者之间的关系强度不相关。

对这个模型的研究迅速扩展到其他社会中。徳格拉夫与弗拉普（De Graaf and Flap,198），分析了 1980 年西德调査中的 628 名男性和 1982 年丹麦调査中的 466 名男性的案例，进一步支持了社会资源命题。不过他们没有检验社会资源的地位强度命题和关系强度命题。1992 年的荷兰家庭调査提供了男女两性在社会资本的影响下的比较数据。当父亲被作为社会交往者提到时，莫比克、鸟尔替与弗拉普（Moerbeek, Ure 和 Fap,1995）就把父亲的职业作为社会资本的指标，结果发现无论对于男性还是女性，父亲的职业都对 首次和当前 / 最后职业地位有显著的正向影响。韦格纳（1991）分析了 1987 年来自徳国的 604 名 42 岁和 32 岁的男女调査者所组成的数据，发现交往者地位对所得工作的声望有显著影响，证实了社会资源命题。但是关系强度命题和地位强度假设没有被检验。巴比里（Barbieri,1996）报告了来自意大利米兰管理领域中的 500 名新雇员的研究。在考虑了来自父亲的地位、教育以及首次和当前职业地位的影响后，他发现交往者地位对当前的职业地位有显著影响，证实了社会资源命题。此外，他发现，父亲的地位通过教育间接地影响了交往者的地位，从而支持了关系强度命题。巴比里把样本分成使用强关系的和弱关系的两个子集之后，发现在交往者地位与获得地位之间的关联中，使用弱关系不具有优势。实际上，一些证据显示，强关系提高了交往者地位与首次和先前职业地位之间的关联。雷克纳（Requena,1991）在西班牙的研究，提供了惟一的否定社会资源命题的数据。该研究表明，尽管社会资源确实影响到收人，但是更多的社会资源并没有提供更好的工作。他推测，社会资源影响的缺乏，部分地由于西班牙在雇佣政策与执行上存在着严格的官僚化（bureau cratization

对理论的系统验证也在亚洲进行。熊瑞梅（Hsung Ray-May）和其他学者在实行资本主义制度的台湾进行了一系列研究。其中一项（Hsung 和 Sun,1988）调査了制造业的动力，另一项（Hsung 和 Hwang,1992）调査了一个都市区域的劳动力（台中）。两项研究都支持了社会资源命题：在

考虑了父亲的教育与职业地位、教育与先前职业地位（以当前工作为准）的影响后，交往者地位对获得的首次和当前职业地位有显著性影响。熊瑞梅和黄毅志（Hsung and Hwang,1992）也发现，研究一定程度上支持了地位强度观点，但是父亲的教育和职业地位对首次工作的交往者地位只有不大的影响，对当前工作的交往者地位没有显著性影响。对关系强度的个综合的测量（与交往者的亲密度、拜访频率、打电话频率和关系的内容）显示，它与首次工作的交往者地位有很弱的负向关系，与当前工作的交往者地位没有关系。此外，边燕杰与昂（Bian 和 Ang,199）1994 年在新加坡做的一项包括 512 名男性和女性的研究，有力地证明了社会资源命题：交往者地位对获得的地位有显著的影响。帮助者地位与当前工作的职业地位、年岭、教育和先前的职业地位强相关。所有的回答者都认为弱关系能接触到更高地位的交往者。但是弱关系（不亲密）对交往者地位没有影响，这个发现类似于马上就要描述的 1988 年天津研究的结论。对那些间接接触帮助者的人，关系强度与交往者地位之间的关联是负向的。但是，中间人与帮助者之间的强关系更可能导致接触更高地位的帮助者。

对上述研究范式的检验已经扩展到不同的政治经济体制下，如国家社会主义。边燕杰（Bian,1997）在 1988 年对中国天津所做的包括 1008 名男性和女性调査对象的研究中发现，帮助者的职业地位（由其工作单位的级来测量），与工作变换中所获得的工作单位地位以及教育和先前的职业地位强相关。自我与帮助者之间的关系强度对帮助者地位的总体影响是不显著的。进一步分析显示，中等强度的关系接触到的帮助者的地位更高，这对于自我与中间人，以及中间人与帮助者之间的关系强度也是正确的。而且，在沃尔科和弗拉普（Volker 和 lap,199）对前民主德国的菜比锡和德累斯顿两个城市所作的追溯硏究（retrospective panel study）中，交往者的职业声望对首次工作和 1989 年时的职业声望都有很强的和显著的影响。这样社会资源命题被证实。但是自我与交往者之间的关系强度对交往者地位或得到的职业地位和收人没有影响。父亲的教育与职业声望对 1989 年求职时

所使用的交往者的地位都没有影响。但是教育对交往者地位有显著的影响。因为父亲的地位对教育有直接的影响，所以这些结果证实了位置强度的间接影响一以教育为中介

获取的社会资本

测量获取的社会资本的方法有两种：定名法（name generators）和定位法（position generators）。定名法更常见，在网络分析的文献中被广泛地使用。通常的方法是提问一个或几个关于自我在某种角色关系（如邻里、工作）、内容领域（如工作事务、家庭杂务）或亲密关系（如信任的、最亲密的互动）中的交往者的问题。这些问题会产生一张包括 3 到 5 名、或者是自我（被访者）所提到的所有交往者的名单。这些名单可以确定自我与交往者之间的关系，交往者之间的关系，以及交往者的特征。社会资本测量被建构出来，是为了反映交往者的资源的异质性与范围（教育、职业），以及交往者的特征（性别、种族、年岭）。用定名法测量社会资本存在着很多问题，包括变量分布要受到回答者的内容领域或角色关系以及所提到人数的影啊。因此，数据往往反映了强关系、强角色关系或受地理约束的关系（Campbell

and Lee, 1991

定位法是林南和他的同事首先提出来的（Lin and Dumin1986）这种方法使用社会中特征显著的结构位置（职业、权威、工作单位、阶级或部门）作为指标，要求回答者指出每一位置上是否有交往者（比如那些熟悉的人）。此外，还要确定自我与每一位置上的交往者之间的关系。定位法研究的不是内容或角色领域，而是等级制位置。它是内容无涉与角色 / 位置中立的。因 此，定位法计算和测量的不是来自生成的具体名字（人）的数据，而是结构性位置的接触。表 6.2 给出了定位法测量的一个例子。

如果您认识一个以上的人，请您考虑认识最久的那一位。

定名法已经在研究中使用很长时间了，而定位法则更多出现在最近的研究中。下面部分将报告用这两种方法对社会资本的获取与地位获得所做的研究及结论。

定名法研究。坎贝尔、马斯顿和赫尔伯特（Campbel, Marsden 和 Hurlbert, 1986）使用来自 1965-1966 年底特律地区的研究中通过定名法收集的数据，检验了网络资源与社会经济地位的关联。他们发现网络的资源构成（教育均值和最大值，声望均值和最大值）与获得的地位，如职业声与家庭收入，显著相关。在对米兰的研究中中，巴比里（Barbieri,196）也用定名法收集的数据建构了社会资本的三个测量指标，在考虑了父母地位、工龄、人力资本（受教育年限）以及首次和先前职业地位后，发现社会资本对目前的职业地位有影响。而且，社会资本受到父亲地位的影响，从而证实了地位强度命题

几个研究已经确定了某些劳动力人口中社会资本的获取与地位获得之间的联系。斯普林格斯、塔兹拉尔和弗拉普（Sprengers, Tazelaar 和 Flap,1988）对失业人员的社会资本进行了研究。在 1978 年或以前失业的 242 位 40-55 岁的丹麦男性中，那些有好的社会资本的人，特别是那些通过弱关系获取社会资本的人，更可能在失业后一年内找到工作。但是，当他们再就业时，并没有获得更好的职业地位或高收入。然而，好的社会资本提高了对工作机会的

乐观估计，这反过来提高了找工作的强度，从而导向更多、更好的工作。而且，劳动力市场的约東越多，拥有较多资本的失业者找工作的强度越大。失业一年以后，那些在强关系（属）中拥有好的社会资本的人，往往在一到三年内有机会再业。研究他发现，那些以前职业和教育好、收人高的人也往往有好的社会资本，从而证实了地位强度命题。博克斯曼、徳格拉夫和弗拉普（Boxman, De Graaf 和 Fap,1991）研究了荷兰的 1359 名大公司总经理，发现教育与社会资本（通过其他组织中的生意上的交往者和俱乐部、专业协会中的成员资格来测量）直接影响到收人。博克斯曼和弗拉普（Boxman 和 Fap,1990）在 1989 年还研究了荷兰已经完成职业培训的 365 人的求职活动。数据来自求职者、雇主以及求职者使用的交往者。对数据的初步分析显示，对收入而言更重要的预测指标是性别（男性有优势）、社会资本、职业前景和公司具体要求的技能。

特（Burt,1992）发现一个大的电子元件与电脑设备公司中的经理得到很快的晋升与很高的奖金。伯特用每个自我嵌人在一个受约東的网络（更少的交往者、更紧密的关系以及与一个单一的交往者有更多的联系）中的程度来测量社会资本，他发现结构性约束与很快的晋升之间存在着一个负向的联系。也即，他暗示着获取网络中多样化的资源会提高取得有用信息的机会，扩大影响，从而提高自己在公司中的地位。在美国一个大的金融组织的投资银行部门中，对于那些高级男性职员，受约束的网络与奖金之间的负向联系同样被发现（Burt,1997)。

定位法研究。林南和杜明（Iin 和 Dumin,1986）分析了来自约奥尔巴尼研究中的数据。该研究从 1960 年美国人口普査的职业列表中抽取了 20 个职业。这些职业的抽样方法是：先对列表中的所有职业按照职业声望分数排序，每隔相等的职业声望等级分数间距确定一组职业；总共分成 20 组，每组职业中选取最普遍的（占据者的频次）职业。每一位被调査者要回答他有哪些位置上的交往者（他熟悉的人）。如果某一位置上的交往者不止一个被调查者选择最熱悉的那个回答。对于每个接触的位置，被调査者都要确定

与交往者的关系（亲属、朋友或熟人）。林南和杜明利用得出的数据矩阵建构了两种社会资源的测量方法：可接触的最高地位（接触的具有最高声塑分数的位置）与接触的地位范围（最高与最低可接触地位之间的差距）。分析显示，这两个测量指标与当前的职业地位具有显著的正相关关系。进一步分析显示，回答者的初始位置（父亲的职业声望分数或者白领一蓝领与高一低职业归类）与这两个测量指标是显著正向相关的，从而证实了地位强度假设。当林南和杜明分析三种类型的关系（亲属、朋友、熟人）与两个接触变量之间的关系时，他们发现朋友和熟人关系为接触最高地位的位置和地位范围提供了最好的机会。

前面提到的熊瑞梅和黄毅志（Hsung 和 Hwang,1992）的对台中的研究，也涉及到网络资源。他们也采用定位法对 20 种职业进行了研究，但是没有发现可接触的最高地位和地位范围具有显著的影响。然而，他们确实发现了测量到的「网络资源的总数」一接触的所有职业的总地位分数对首次工作地位的显著影响。但是它们对当前的职业地位没有任何影响。沃尔科和弗拉普（Volker 和 Fap,199）在对德国的研究中，使用定位法让回答者在 33 种职业中确认他们在哪种职业中有认识的人，如果有，继续回答与他们之间是什么关系（亲属、朋友和熟人）。他们发现，对于 1989 年的职业地位，在控制父亲的教育与职业、回答者自己的教育与性別、他们的首次职业的声望以后，接触最高地位的影响是正向且显著的。当 1989 年的职业声望与其他独立变量增加到方程中时，这个变量对 1989 年的收人也有正向与中等程度（p <010）的影响。这个结果证实了社会资源命题。此外，沃尔科和弗拉普发现，通过亲属和熟人比通过朋友能接触到职业更好的交往者（上层白领或更高声望的职业）。另一方面，通过熟人比通过亲属和朋友能接触到更大的职业范围（最高与最低声职业之间的差距）。因此可接触的最高职业声望是所得地位的最好的预测指标，而弱关系的影响没有被发现（因为亲属和熟人几乎等于可能接触到高职业声望的交往者）。父亲的职业声望在总体上与可接触的最高职业声望正相关，它与通过亲属、朋友和熟人接触的每组职业也呈正相关关系。因此，地位强度命题被证实。安杰勒兹和塔徳斯（1991)

在 1989 年前的匈牙利（1987-1988），使用定位法研究了「具有弱连接性质」的关系或资源。在考虑了性别、教育、居佳地和年龄的影响后，这个变量被发现与工资显著相关。

埃里克森（Erickson,1995,1996）在 1991-1992 年间对多伦多的个人安全行业（161 个防卫、调査和安全公司）的研究中，使用赖特（Wright,1979）的阶级维度（所有权控制、组织控制和技术控制）选择了 19 种职业，收集了 155 名雇员、46 名监督、80 名经理和 112 名雇主的数据。埃里克森发现，社会资本（接触的社会位置的异质性）增加了职业的自主性与权威，这反过来产生了更好的职业回报。他的主要结论是：(1）获取的社会资本有助于人们升迁到更高的位置（在经理 VS 低层雇员与雇主 VS 雇员之间作对比）（2）即使人们不使用关系找工作，社会资本也奏效（参见下一节对招聘与社会资本的讨论）。在埃里克森（Erickson,1998）关于社会资本的另一项研究中，他区分了全球性与地方性两种类型的社会资本。地方性的坏境指地理区域（邻里）、族群领域（族群社区与飞地经济或组织（学校、自愿组织、社会运动或公司）。在对多伦多地方就业与贸易体系（Local Employment and Trading System；简称 LEIS）的 352 名被调査者的电话访谈中，埃里克森让被访者从 30 种职业中确认在地方就业与贸易体系内外的交往者。分析显示，地方性社会资本与在地方就业与贸易体系（地方经济）中的收入相关联，而全球性社会资本并不与一般经济中的收人相关联，它的影响主要取决于全球经济体系。

获取与动员的社会资本的联合作用

既然在地位获得过程中存在着两种类型的社会资本，那么一种合乎逻辑的做法是，在一项单独的研究中同时检验获取与动员的社会资本。从中引出的理论问题是，获取的社会资本在什么程度上促进了社会资本的进一步增加，也即，获取更多的社会资本是否会提高动员好的社会资本的可能性。这个假设暗含着结构性的机会与优势的存在。然而，我们推测这个一致性也不

是绝对的一并不是所有已经获取丰富的社会资本的人，都能利用或动员社会资本获得更好的社会经济地位。行动与选择的因素也是很重要的。有几个研究已经证明了这一点。

例如，博克斯曼和弗拉普（Boxman,1992; Fap 和 Boxman,1996）对职业培训结业者的研究显示，交往者的地位（动员的社会资本）影响了获得的职业地位，而获取的社会资本对此没有影响。沃尔科和弗拉普（Volker and Fap,196）对德国的一项研究也同时测量了获取的与动员的社会资本对地位获得的影响。结果发现，使用定位法测量的可接触的最高职业声望与 1989 年求职中使用的交往者的地位呈显著正相关关系，它对 1989 年的职业声望的直接影响虽然是正向的，但只是中等显著水平（P <.10)。交往者的声望有更强的影响。实际上，一且首次职业声望包括进来，交往者的声望对 1989 年职业声望的直接影响比教育更强（而且是最显著的预测指标）。

赖、林南和龙（1998）也使用奥尔巴尼的数据（Iin, Ensel 和 Vaughn, 1981）检验了获取与动员的社会资本对地位获得的联合作用。他们的研究既包括使用定位法对网络资源进行的测量（Lin and Dumin,1986），又包括对结构方程模型中的交往者资源（在求职中的交往者的地位）的测量，结果显示，教育（获得的地位）与交往者地位显著、直接地影响了当前的职业地位。交往者地位反过来被父母地位（先赋地位）、教育、网络资源以及与交往者的弱关系所影响。因此，动员的社会资本直接地影响了地位获得，而它又被获取的社会资本以及先赋予自致地位所影响。

问题与研究方向

研究一致证实了社会资本命题：超越个人资源的社会资源对地位获得有重要的作用。这个关联的存在跨越了社会（不同的民族一国家和政治经济体）、エ业化与发展水平、劳动力市场中的群体（刚毕业者、新雇佣者、变换工作者）、不同的经济部门（行业、组织、在组织中的位置）以及地位获得结果（职业、权威、部门、晋升、奖金）。这个关联在不同的概念（获取

的对动员的资本）与测量（定名法 VS 定位法）中都保持显著。但是将来仍然存在着很多概念与研究的重要问题要解决。下面部分将简要地总结和讨论这一系列问题。

非正式和正式的求职渠道

现在已经非常清楚，在地位获得中使用非正式渠道本身并不比其他渠道，特别是正式渠道具有优势。实际上，如果有的话，非正式渠道往往被女性、教育水平低的与缺乏技能的弱势群体所使用，因此获得的地位往往是很低的。但是，对于那些使用非正式渠道的人而言，社会资源（交往者的地位）起主要作用。这里有几个问题。首先，优势群体因为拥有更多的人力资本，可以直接申请高地位的位置，而真的不需要使用非正式渠道吗？这要具体分析。对于一些有具体要求的工作（如处理技术和硬件问题），技能与培川的证书可能足以保证在正式申请中获得职位。但是对于其他重要的工作（高层管理和涉及到人际交往的职位），正式的证书经常不能充分传达足以表现职位占据者的社会技能与资源的信息，而需要非正式的或隐秘的渠道来实现这些功能。但是，这仍然不能在调査中得到测量，从而构成了方法论上的个重要挑战。其次，对于弱势群体，社会资本是受到约東的（地位强度论点）。除了资源受到约以外，我们不知道弱势群体在动员他们可以利用的最好资源方面是否也存在着劣势，从而导致双倍的损失。关于优势群体与弱势群体的选择行为的知识，将有助于区分结构性约与选择性约束。

关系强度还是网络位置？

虽然社会资源命题和地位强度命题已经被一致证实（参见表 61），但是关系强度命题还存在着很多模糊的地方。不应该期望关系强度本身对地位获得的结果施加直接的影响（Granovetter,1995），很多研究指出它们之间缺乏直接的关联（如 Bridges and Villemez,1986; Marsden and Hurlbert,1988; Forse,

1997)。修正的命题一一弱关系可以获取好的社会资源一也缺乏一致的经验支持（参见表 6.1)。但是，社会资本理论既论述到结构的影响，又论述到行动的影响，对结构性约束内的网络或关系选择的进一步阐述可能最终是有意义的。几个研究思路已经提供了一些线索。例如，有观点认为，关系强度对获取和动员社会资源的影响可能取决于原初地位。一些研究已经指出了关系强度的天花板效应（ceiling effect）：在等级制的顶层及其附近，强关系往往会导致成功的地位获得（Lin, Ensel and Vaughn,1981; Erickson 1995,199)。最弱的关系很明显是没有用的（Bian,197 Bian and Ang, 1997），因为没有强度的关系是不能刺激交换的。另一方面，最强的关系可能是有用的，尽管它接触的资源范围受到约束。根据定义，关系代表着承诺、信任与义务，以及由此而来的帮助的动机。愿意并努力使用这些强关系来寻找其他关系，在制度的不确定性或约束下（例如在国家社会主义下 Rus,195, Bian,1997; 或者市场紧缺的情况下：Sprengers, Tazelaar and Flap 198）可能是很关键的。组织性的约束和机会可能也取决于弱关系或强关系的相对功用（Lin,1990)。

另一个可能澄凊问题的途径是用网络的术语修改关系强度的概念。例如，关系强度可能反映在自我与最终提供资源的他人之间的连接长度上。如果每一个连接具有相等的强度，那么自我与他人之间的关系强度可能成为他们之间的连接长度的反函数：联系链越长，关系越弱。虽然多重连接必然削弱自我与「最后一环的他人」之间的义务、信任和互惠，但是这样一个链条也护展了不在自我的网络中心领域的资源范围。在某种程度上，异质的或丰富的资源存在于网络的外缘，这样长链条或弱关系就可能变得有用了。沿着这条线索继续分析（如 Bian1997），将会澄清桥梁影响与关系强度影响的效用。

其他的研究转向社会络中的位置角度。社会关系的功用可能更加依赖于行动者在社会网络或等级制结构中的位置，而不是关系强度（例如，Lin and Dutin,1986; Angelusz and Tardos,1991; Burt,199)。战略位置或附近的位置，如桥梁或结构洞，可能为行动者获取异质的和丰富的资源提供了竞争优势。

这些研究与发现深化了社会资本理论的命题，正如第五章所闻述的，网络位置连同结构性位置提供了预测工具性行动如何可能获得好的社会资本的钥匙

定位法的进一步发展

为了确定因果关系，需要考虑交往的时间框架。例如，使用定位法的研究可能要问，「当你正在寻找第一份（或当前的）工作的时候，你知道谁从事这种工作吗？」在一个特定的社会中，从一个有意义的等级制中对位置进行抽样也是很重要的。在某些社会中，除了职业地位或声望以外，工作单位、部门、权威或自主权可能代表着重要的地位。用定位法确定位置的一个重要考虑，就是它在特定社会的地位 / 阶级中具有意义（Erickson,1995)。

社会资本的不平等

在获取社会资本上的差异应该受到更多的研究关注。社会群体（性别、种族）由于其或优势或弱势的结构性位置与社会网络，而对社会资本有不同的获取能力。例如，社会资本的不平等为妇女与少数民族动员好的社会资源，获得和改善职业地位，提供的机会比较少。弱势群体为了获得更好的地位，其策略性的行为需要超出他们通常的社会子（如女性），使用男性关系（Ensel,1979）在公司中寻找担保人（Bur,1998）和加人男性支配的俱乐部（Beggs and Hurlbert,1997）以获取资源；黑人要在他们自己的邻居之外找关系或者与那些有工作的人建立联系（oreen, Tigges and Browne,1995）；墨西哥血统的学生要寻找非墨西哥血统的关系，或者与老师、辅导员等制度性的代理人建立关系（Stanton- Salazar and Dornbusch,1995; Stanton- Salazar,1997)。关于社会资本不平等的系统的数据，将为社会分层与流动中的不平等提供个解释框架，并提供克服这些不平等的行为选择。下一章将会从这个方向进行阐述。

招聘与社会资本

社会资本与地位获得之间的关系适应劳动力市场的供需两面。到目前为止，研究文献主要关注供给一面一求职者地位获得过程的视角。对模型的需求一面的研究组织招聘过程的视角只是刚刚出现（Boxman and Flap, 1990, Boxman, De Graaf and Flap, 1991; Erickson, 1995, 1996; Burt, 1997, Fernandez and Weinberg,1997)。由于在公司的运行环境中，社会技能与网络在交易和交换中扮演着关键性的角色，公司在招聘的时很重视社会资本，特别是对于某些特殊类型的位置。我们可以想到，在公司中的某些类型的位置比其他位置需要更多的社会资本。首先，高层执行官被期望拥有丰富的社会资本，因为他们需要应付和管理公司内外的各种人。事实上，我们可以假定，最高层管理位置上的占据者的社会资本远比人力资本重要。因此可以推测，像 IBM 和微软这样的公司更可能招聘社会技能丰富的经理，而不是计算机专家做它们的 CEO。著名大学需要有社会技能的校长与教职人员、学生、父母和校友谈判，筹集资金，而不是要求他们取得卓越的学术成就。其次，我们希望应付人（如护士）而不是机器或技术（如编程人员）的位置被拥有好的社会资本的占据者填补。再者，公司外缘的位置更可能由拥有好的社会资本的人来填充（如推销员、公关人员或驻外经理；But,1997)。因此，需要这样位置的公司，在招聘中应该更广泛地使用非正式的信息来源。这些假设将有助于经验性说明与检验。

社会资本与人力资本

社会资本与人力资本之间的关系具有重要的理论意义。一些学者 （Bourdieu,1983/1986; Coleman,1990）已经提出，社会资本有助于人力资本的生产。联系广泛的父母和社会关系确实可以提高个人获得好的教育、培训与技能、知识证书的机会。另方面，人力资本也可以导致社会资本的增加。

受过良好教育和培训的个体往往出人资源丰富的社会圈子和俱乐部。一个很难回答的问题是：这两者之中，哪一个对于地位获得更重要？这一章列举的几个研究表明，在地位获得中社会资本可能与人力资本（教育和工作经验同样重要，或者比人力资本更重要（Iin, Ensel and Vaughn,1981; Marsden and Hurlbert,198)。而其他学者提出了相反的观点（Hsung and Sun,198; De Graaf and Flap,1988; Hsung and Hwang,1992)。工业化或许不能解释这种对立，因为前者包括在美国做的研究，而后者包括在荷兰和台湾进行的研究。更可能的解释是，特定的教育制度与职业分配和搜寻的方法之间存在着关联。正如克里姆考斯基（1991）对 20 世纪 70 年代美国、西徳和波兰的数据所进行的比较分析显示，西徳和波兰在社会出身与教育之间以及教育与职业分配之间比美国表现出更强的关联。但是没有明显的证据表明，台湾的教育体系更像西徳和荷兰，而不同于美国。从这些国家的比较中得出的结果有待于继续研究。

更有迷惑力的可能是人力资本与社会资本之间的互动。博克斯曼、德格拉夫和弗拉普（Boxman, De Graaf and Flap,1991）发现，当社会资本的值很低的时候，人力资本对收人的影响最大；当社会资本的值很高的时候，人力资本对收人的影响最小。此外，弗拉普和徳格拉夫（Flap and Boxman,198）对荷兰经理人员的研究发现，对于高层经理，无论其人力资本处于什么层次，社会资本都会带来更高的收人，但是当社会资本处于高层次时，人力资本的回报会减少。如果这些模式可以被证实，将意味着人力资本在地位获得中对社会资本起着补充作用。也即，当社会资本的值很高的时候，不管人力资本处在什么层次上，获得的地位都将很高；当社会资本的值很低的时，人力资本对地位获得有着很强的影响。或者说，假定人力资本与社会资本都处于某种最低层次，社会资本将是解释地位获得的更重要的因素。

结束语

关于社会资本与地位获得的研究文献很丰富，由于篇幅的原因，这一章

只能提供一个简略的介绍。很多研究当前正在世界各地进行，这里没有涵盖它们。然而很明显，这个研究传统已经大大促进了社会资本理论本身的发展，同时为这一理论的证实和继续演进提供了各种详细的经验数据。这项研究事业真正展现了理论与研究之间持续不断地相互影响和反馈的重要性与富有成效。
