## 0201. Inventing Laws of Nature

· · · in which I argue that models are invented, not discovered; that engineers and scientists use models in complementary, almost opposite ways; that all models are wrong, but some are useful; and that the use of models can slow as well as advance technological progress by establishing a backdrop of unknown knowns, by forcing increased specialization, and by requiring humans to assimilate new paradigms.

0201 发明自然法则

在本章，我将阐述：1）模型是被发明的，而不是被发现的；2）工程师和科学家以互补的却又几乎相反的方式使用模型；3）所有模型都是错的，但有些是有用的；4）模型的使用可以通过建立未知知识的背景、强制提升专业化程度以及要求人类吸收新的范式，来减缓或促进技术的进步。

### 2.1 The Unknown Knowns

Drawn by its provocative title, I recently read Inventing Nature, a wonderful book by Andrea Wulf (Wulf, 2015). Wulf's book tells the story of Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), a remarkable Prussian about whom I had previously known nothing except that Humboldt county and Humboldt Redwoods State Park in California, along with numerous other places and things, had been named after him. Wulf boldly states,「Humboldt gave us our concept of nature itself.」Easing somewhat my embarrassment at my ignorance, she goes on,「The irony is that Humboldt's views have become so self-evident that we have largely forgotten the man behind them.」Further easing my embarrassment, Sandra Nichols (2006), in an article titled「Why was Humboldt forgotten in the United States?」reassures me that I am not alone. Nichols postulates many reasons for our collective amnesia, but to me the most poignant is「shifts in scholarship,」where「the search for a comprehensive view of science was soon set aside in favor of specialization.」In Germany, Humboldt and his brother Wilhelm have most definitely not been forgotten. The Humboldt University of Berlin is named after the two of them, and the brother, Wilhelm, is credited with establishing the「Humboldtian model of higher education,」which integrates teaching in the arts and sciences with research. This is a defining principle of all top universities today.

In her claim that Alexander von Humboldt「invented nature,」Wulf shows us that scientific truths can come into existence and then become part of the human psyche, background knowledge that we accept with such tenacity that we no longer think of them as scientific truths. They just are. Wulf summarizes Humboldt's breakthrough:

Humboldt revolutionized the way we see the natural world. He found connections everywhere. Nothing, not even the tiniest organism, was looked at on its own.「In this great chain of causes and effects,」Humboldt said,「no single fact can be considered in isolation.」

Wulf credits Humboldt with being the first scientist to show evidence of human-induced climate change, for founding the field of ecology, and for articulating the first modern notion of「nature」itself. The most astonishing part of this story is that it never occurred to me that the connectedness of nature was not just a simple self-evident truth. It is so widely accepted today that it fades into the background of our basic instinct, along with notions of time and causality. Wulf explains the prevailing scientific thought at Humboldt's time:

Inventions such as telescopes and microscopes revealed new worlds and with them a belief that the laws of nature could be discovered.

But Wulf points out that these laws of nature were understood one phenomenon at a time, as in Newton's laws of motion governing a falling object. Connectedness fell victim to reductionism.

Connectedness faded from our conscious approach to science into the unconscious, part of an unseen background, an unknown known. US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, at a Department of Defense news briefing in 2002, made the following often quoted statement:

· · · as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones [sic]. (Rumsfeld, 2002)

The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek pointed out that Rumsfeld didn't mention an obvious fourth category of knowledge, the「unknown knowns.」These are the things we know but don't know that we know, which Žižek says is「precisely the Freudian unconscious」(Žižek, 2004). The interconnectedness of nature was, until I read Wulf's book, one of my unknown knowns. I didn't know that I knew that. Now I do, and thanks to Wulf, I also now realize that this「truth」that I know was not always known. She credits Humboldt with making it known.

Our unknown knowns bias our thinking. Thomas Kuhn, in his 1964 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , disrupted the prevailing view of science as「development-by-accumulation」(Kuhn, 1962). Instead of an accretion of discovered facts about the world, a scientific discipline is founded on a「paradigm,」a conceptual framework that practitioners use, often unknowingly, to interpret observations and develop theories. Kuhn argued that these paradigms make scientific understanding necessarily subjective.

Observation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible scientific belief, else there would be no science. But they cannot alone determine a particular body of such belief. An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident , is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientific community at a given time. [emphasis added]

Kuhn's「arbitrary element」often takes the form of unknown knowns. A paradigm becomes so widely accepted and strongly held that its subjects no longer know it is there. They accept the paradigm as truth. As argued by Kant, the order we perceive in the world is shaped by our mind, which provides the distorting lens through which we perceive it. We impose order on nature rather than the other way around.

Kuhn's central claim is that scientific revolution, the truly momentous advances that occur from time to time, come about through paradigm shifts rather than through accretion of knowledge. The notion of scientific truth is therefore subjective, defined more by consensus of a scientific community than by Plato's ideal disembodied truth. An obvious corollary is that a paradigm is invented more than discovered.

Kuhn's position was highly controversial. It went very much against the grain of the prevailing philosophy of science, best articulated by Popper, which was about seeking objective truths. In 1965, a colloquium convened in London drew together many of the most prominent thinkers on the philosophy of science to respond to Kuhn's thesis. Imre Lakatos, a Hungarian philosopher of mathematics and science, and co-editor of the proceedings from the colloquium, wrote,「 in Kuhn's view scientific revolution is irrational, a matter for mob psychology 」(Lakatos, 1970, emphasis in the original). He goes on to criticize the notion of a「paradigm shift,」writing that it is

a mystical conversion which is not and cannot be governed by rules of reason and which falls totally within the realm of the (social) psychology of discovery. Scientific change is a kind of religious change. [emphasis in the original]

Despite these objections, Kuhn's notion of governing paradigms is useful for understanding the evolution of scientific thought. It is even more useful for understanding technology, where paradigms can be more obviously subjective.

In our modern technological world, our lives are governed by paradigms that are more obviously invented rather than discovered. These paradigms shape our understanding of the world, becoming unknown knowns. Consider, for example, the fact that in music and performing arts, it used to be that performer and observer had to be in the same room at the same time. Today, we can use Spotify and Hulu, among others, to carry much of the world's music and theater in our pockets, to be enjoyed whenever and wherever we choose. Most of us alive today have been able to listen to music without being in the same room with the musicians. This fact has changed the very meaning of the word「music」in ways that we don't notice. Think, for example, about the meaning of the phrase「my music.」What would that have meant to a citizen of the nineteenth century, before Edison?

I was once telling my wife that a colleague at Berkeley, Miki Lustig, was leading a charge to teach many students, staff, and faculty at Berkeley about amateur radio, and to help them prepare to take the test to become licensed to operate amateur radios. My wife asked me why one would want to operate an amateur radio. The question had never occurred to me, and off the cuff, the best answer I could come up with was,「So they can communicate with anyone around the world.」She asked me,「Why don't they just send email?」I saw a collision of paradigms, less momentous than the collision of two black holes, but nevertheless notable. Being able to communicate instantaneously with anyone around the world has become a background fact, an unknown known, a part of the technological paradigm through which we understand and manage our daily lives.

Paradigms change. Kuhn's scientific paradigms change relatively infrequently, and the changes can be quite disruptive to a scientific community. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , Kuhn quotes Max Planck:

A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.

The same thing happens with technological paradigms. Witness how much of modern technology becomes inaccessible to an aging brain. Our kids accept technological truths that are incomprehensible to older people. In fact, I believe that the pace of technological progress today is more limited by the inability of humans to absorb new paradigms than it is by any physical limitations of the technology.

Kuhn is generous to scientists whose paradigms are later supplanted by better paradigms:

· · · those once current views of nature were, as a whole, neither less scientific nor more the product of human idiosyncrasy than those current today.

· · · If these out-of-date beliefs are to be called myths, then myths can be produced by the same sorts of methods and held for the same sorts of reasons that now lead to scientific knowledge.

We should be similarly generous to humans whose technological paradigms become obsolete, rather than thinking of them as luddites or dinosaurs. I would say to my kids,「Don't worry, you too someday will be a dinosaur.」

Despite similarities, technological paradigms differ from scientific ones in significant ways. Technological paradigms are today much more diverse than scientific paradigms, reflecting immaturity of the field and rapid change. Kuhn argues that scientific paradigms are incommensurable. One paradigm cannot be understood or judged through the conceptual framework and terminology of the other. I will show in chapter 3 that this is less the case for technological paradigms, which may be layered in such a way as to interoperate. Nevertheless, incommensurable paradigms do arise, and it becomes necessary to build a metaparadigm within which to compare technological paradigms. I will attempt to do that through the notion of modeling.

Science, technology, and engineering are all built on models. Models are artifacts in the conceptual framework of a paradigm. Newton's second law, for example, is a model of the motion of an object subjected to a force. It takes the form of an equation, specifically equation (4096) on page 14 , which has meaning in the paradigm of Newton's and Leibniz's calculus, the concept of force, and the Newtonian notion of time and space. If you studied physics in high school, you probably got brainwashed sufficiently that the concepts of force, time, and space are among your unknown knowns. But objectively, Newton gave no physical explanation for these concepts. Instead, he built a self-consistent and self-referential model where each of these concepts is defined in terms of the others, if defined at all.

Every engineered design is similarly a model, which can be as simple as a prototype of a physical shape or as complex as a million lines of code. Each such model has a meaning, a semantics , only within some modeling paradigm. And the modeling paradigm is all too often an unknown known, never articulated or consciously chosen. I will attempt now to break the logjam that is created by failing to recognize these unknown knowns.

2.1 未知的已知

受其颇具煽动性的标题吸引，我最近读了安德烈娅·武尔夫所著的《发明自然》一书（武尔夫，2015）。武尔夫在书中讲述了有关亚历山大·冯·洪堡（1769-1859）的故事。洪堡是一位杰出的普鲁士人，之前除了听说过用他的名字命名的加利福尼亚州洪堡县和洪堡红杉州立公园以及其他许多地方和东西之外，我对他就知之甚少了。武尔夫大胆地评论说：「洪堡给了我们关于自然本身的概念。」她的评论缓解了我因自己的无知而产生的尴尬，她接着说：「颇具讽刺意味的是，洪堡的观点已经如此不言自明，以至我们基本上已经忘了提出这些观点的这个人。」在一篇题为「为什么洪堡在美国被遗忘？」的文章中，桑德拉·尼科尔斯（2006）的观点进一步消除了我的尴尬，让我再次确信自己其实并不孤单，还有其他人和我的想法一样。尼科尔斯为我们的集体健忘症假定了很多原因。但是，对我来说，最令人感到心酸的是「学术上的转变」，即「对科学的全面观点的研究很快就被搁置一边，转而支持专业化」。在德国，洪堡和他的哥哥威廉肯定没有被遗忘。柏林洪堡大学是以他们两人的名字命名的。他的哥哥威廉被誉为「洪堡式高等教育模式」的创立者，该模式将文理学科中的教学与研究结合起来。这是当今所有顶尖大学的基本原则。

武尔夫声称亚历山大·冯·洪堡「发明了自然」，她向我们表明，科学真理可以存在，然后成为人类精神的一部分。我们如此坚定地接受了这些背景知识，以至我们不再将它们视为科学真理。然而，它们就是科学真理。武尔夫用下面这段话总结了洪堡的成就：

洪堡彻底改变了我们看待自然世界的方式。他认为联系无处不在。没有任何东西是孤立存在的，即使是最小的有机体，也不是孤立的。「在这个巨大的因果链中，」洪堡说，「我们不应孤立地考虑其中的任何一个事实。」

武尔夫称赞说，洪堡是第一位证明人类活动导致气候变化的科学家，他创立了生态学领域，并阐明了「自然」本身的第一个现代概念。这个故事最令人惊讶的地方在于，我从来没有想到，大自然的连通性不再是一个简单的理所当然的真理。现在，人们已经如此广泛地接受了这种观念，以至它与时间和因果关系的概念一道逐渐融入我们直觉的背景中。武尔夫解释了洪堡时代盛行的科学思想：

诸如望远镜和显微镜这样的发明，它们揭示了人类尚不了解的新世界，并且使人类相信自然法则是可以被发现的。

但是，武尔夫指出，这些自然法则一次只能被理解为一种现象，就像支配下落物体的牛顿运动定律一样。连通性成为还原论的牺牲品。

连通性从我们对科学的有意识方法中逐渐消失，进而进入无意识中，成为一个看不见的大背景的一部分，一个未知的已知。2002 年，美国国防部长唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德在国防部新闻发布会上发表了以下这段被广泛引用的声明：

…… 如我们所知，存在一些已知的已知，有些事物我们知道我们是知道的；我们也知道存在一些已知的未知，也就是说，我们知道有一些事物我们是不知道的。但也存在一些未知的未知 —— 那些我们不知道我们还不知道的事物。纵观我们国家和其他那些自由国家的历史，我们就会发现后者往往是最难的一类。（拉姆斯菲尔德，2002）

斯洛文尼亚哲学家斯拉沃伊·齐泽克指出，拉姆斯菲尔德没有提到显而易见的第四类知识，即「未知的已知」。它指的是那些我们不知道其实我们已经知道的事物。齐泽克说，「正像弗洛伊德的无意识一样」（齐泽克，2004）。直到我读了武尔夫的书以后，大自然的连通性才成为我的未知的已知之一。我过去不知道我已经知道了。多亏了武尔夫，我现在也意识到我所知道的「真理」并不总是为人所知，她相信正是洪堡使其为人所知的。

我们的未知的已知导致我们的思想产生了许多偏见。托马斯·库恩在他 1964 年出版的《科学革命的结构》一书中，打破了普遍流行的「积累式发展」（库恩，1962）科学观。库恩认为，一门科学学科是建立在「范式」的基础之上的，而非建立在已经发现的关于世界的事实积累之上。这是一种概念性框架，实践者常常在不知不觉中使用它来解释观察到的现象，并发展各种理论。库恩认为，这些范式使我们对科学的理解必然带有主观性。

观察和经验可以而且一定会大幅限制可接受科学信念的发展范围，否则就不会有科学。但它们无法单独决定这种信念的某一特定主体。一个明显的任意性因素，混合了个人和历史的偶然性，常常成为一个特定科学群体在特定时期所崇尚的信念的形成要素。

库恩所说的「任意性因素」往往是以未知的已知这种形式存在的。一种范式被如此广泛地接受，并获得强烈的支持，以至接受它的主体不再能体会到它的存在，这些主体认为范式即真理。正如康德所言，我们在世界上所感知到的秩序是由我们的头脑塑造的，我们的头脑为我们提供了感知世界的歪曲的透镜。我们把秩序强加给自然，而不是反之。

库恩的核心主张认为，科学革命，也就是不时发生的真正重大的科学进步，是通过范式的转换而不是知识的积累实现的。因此，科学真理的概念是主观的，其是由科学界的共识而不是柏拉图式理想的无形真理所定义的。由此，就可以得出一个明显的推论 —— 范式多是被发明的而非被发现的。

库恩的观点备受争议。这与当时流行的科学哲学观点背道而驰，也就是波普尔清楚地表达过的寻求客观真理。1965 年，在伦敦召开的一次学术研讨会上，许多最杰出的科学哲学家齐聚一堂并对库恩的观点做出了回应。匈牙利数学和科学哲学家伊姆雷·拉卡托什担任研讨会论文集的共同编辑，他写道，「在库恩看来，科学革命是非理性的，是群氓心理下的肆意行为」（拉卡托什，1970）。他接着又批评了库恩的「范式转换」的概念，并写道：

一种不受也不可能受理性规则支配的神秘转变，完全属于（社会）发现心理学的范畴。科学变革类似于一种宗教革命。

尽管存在这些异议，但是库恩的支配范式概念对于理解科学思想的演变还是有用的。对于理解工程技术来说，库恩的观点甚至更有价值，因为在工程技术中范式可能会显得更加主观。

在现代科技的世界里，我们的生活被一些范式支配。这些范式更明显是被发明出来的，而不是被发现的。这些范式塑造了我们对世界的理解，成为未知的已知。举个例子，过去我们要听音乐或观看表演，就必须和表演者共处在相同的时空里。而今天，我们可以使用诸如 Spotify 音乐服务平台和 Hulu 视频网站等服务平台，它们能够把世界上大部分音乐和剧院里演出的剧目装在我们的口袋里，让我们随时随地都可以欣赏。今天，我们中的大多数人已无须到现场就能听音乐了。这一事实不经意地改变了「音乐」这个词的含义。例如，让我们来想想「我的音乐」这个短语的含义吧。在爱迪生发明留声机之前，这个词对于 19 世纪的人们意味着什么呢？

有一次，我告诉我的妻子，伯克利大学的一位同事米基·卢斯蒂格正在负责一门课程，教伯克利大学的学生、行政人员和教职人员学习业余无线电知识，并帮助他们准备获得业余无线电台使用资格的考试。

我妻子问我为什么那些人要使用业余无线电台。可是，我从来没有想过这个问题。我想了想，我能想到的最好的答案是：「这样他们就可以和世界上的任何人进行交流了。」她又问我：「他们为什么不直接发电子邮件呢？」我看到不同范式的相互碰撞。当然，这种碰撞没有两个黑洞的碰撞那么严重，但仍值得我们注意。能够与世界各地的任何人进行即时交流已经成为一个不争的事实，是一个未知的已知，是我们理解和支配日常生活的技术范式的一部分。

范式经常会发生改变。库恩的科学范式变化相对较少，但这些变化可能会对科学界造成相当大的破坏。在《科学革命的结构》一书中，库恩引用了马克斯·普朗克的话：

一个新的科学真理并不是通过说服对手并让他们看到真理之光而获得胜利的，而是因为它的对手最终会死去，而熟悉它的新一代人会成长起来。

1-2-3『上面的这段话，在 N 多个地方看到过，新范式的胜利是因为坚守老范式的那些科学家最终死去了。做一张任意卡片。（2021-10-24）』—— 已完成

同样的事情也发生在技术范式上。让我们来看看有多少现代科技让老化的大脑根本无法领悟。我们的孩子当然能够很快接受老年人无法理解的技术真理。事实上，我认为当今技术进步的步伐更多地受到人类无法吸收新范式的限制，而非技术本身存在的任何限制。

库恩对那些曾经持有的范式被后来更好的范式取代的科学家说出了以下的慷慨之词：

…… 总的来说，那些曾经流行的自然观与今天流行的自然观相比，无论在科学性还是人文性方面都毫不逊色。

…… 如果这些过时的信念可以被称为神话，那么可以用同样的方法制造神话，并以同样的理由坚持这些神话，而这些理由现在导致了科学知识的产生。

我们应该同样慷慨地对待那些生活在过时的技术范式时代的人，而不应把他们当作卢德派分子或恐龙。我会对我的孩子们说：「别担心，有一天你也会变成恐龙的。」

尽管有相似之处，但是，技术范式与科学范式在许多重要的方面的确存在差异。如今，技术范式要远比科学范式更加多样，这反映了该领域发展的不成熟和快速变化。库恩认为，不同的科学范式之间是不可通约的。一种范式不能以另一种范式的概念体系和术语加以理解或判断。然而，技术范式不存在这种情形，因为技术范式是以互操作的方式进行分层的。我将在第 3 章进行说明。然而，不可通约的范式确实出现了，因此有必要建立一个元范式，并在该范式中比较不同的技术范式。我将尝试通过建模的概念达成这一目标。

科学、技术和工程都是建立在模型之上的。模型是范式概念框架中的组件。例如，牛顿第二运动定律是物体在受力作用下的运动模型。它的形式是一个方程，具体来说就是方程（4 096）。它在牛顿和莱布尼茨微积分的范式中，在力的概念以及牛顿的时间和空间概念中都有意义。如果你在高中学过物理，那么你可能已经被彻底洗脑了，以至力、时间和空间的概念都成为你未知的已知。但从客观上来说，牛顿并没有对这些概念做出实质性的解释。相反，他建立了一个自我一致和自我参照的模型。如果说他下了什么定义的话，就是其中的每个概念都是以其他概念来定义的。

每个工程设计都类似于一个模型，它可以像一个物理形状的原型那样简单，也可以像一百万行代码那样复杂。每个这样的模型只有在某种建模的范式中才有一个含义，或者说一个语义。建模范式往往是一个未知的已知，从未被清晰地表达或有意识地选择过。现在，我将尝试打破由于没有认识到这些未知的已知而造成的困难局面。

### 2.2 Models of Nature

Merriam-Webster's online dictionary has no fewer than 14 definitions of the word「model.」Only a few of these are relevant to how models are used in science and engineering:

4 a usually miniature representation of something; also: a pattern of something to be made

5 an example for imitation or emulation

· · ·

7 archetype

· · ·

11 a description or analogy used to help visualize something (as an atom) that cannot be directly observed

12 a system of postulates, data, and inferences presented as a mathematical description of an entity or state of affairs; also: a computer simulation based on such a system.

The first of these definitions is a concrete model, a material object in the physical world, whereas the last two are abstract models, where any material realization, for example, as ink on paper, is incidental. The two in the middle could be either concrete or abstract. Both abstract and concrete models help humans grasp concepts. Both kinds of models are created by humans. Models, therefore, can serve as a way for humans to record and communicate concepts.

For Aristotle, concepts about the world arise from the common properties of particular things (see figure 2.2 ). Particular things can serve as models for the family of things that fit the concept or as models for the concept itself. The concept of a horse, for example, is a generalization formed from the observation of a few horses. A plastic figurine in the shape of horse, such as the one being printed in figure 2.3 , can serve as a concrete model of a horse. Note that the model need not itself be a horse. A concrete model is a physical thing that captures some essence of the things being modeled.

The notion of a concrete model connects naturally to another of Merriam-Webster's definitions,「one who is employed to display clothes or other merchandise.」Consider the model in the poster shown in figure 2.4 . That model was presumably employed to display something, but interestingly, the merchandise being advertised by this poster, cologne, is not shown on the poster. The model instead was employed to be an exemplar of a「sexy human male」(to be sure, I'm talking about the one in the poster, not the one in the reflection). The model (a human) was employed to serve as a model (an archetype) of a sexy human male. The purpose of such a model is to sell cologne to an individual (perhaps the one in the reflection) by evoking an image of how attractive he might become by wearing such cologne.

Platonic Forms, according to Plato, exist independent of humans, as disembodied truths. A Platonic sphere is perfect. The physical world provides no such sphere. It does not and cannot exist as a physical object. Any physical embodiment of a sphere will be made of some material composed of atoms and molecules. No matter how smoothly polished it is, the surface of the sphere will not match the Platonic concept, but rather will have dents and undulations and a fuzziness imposed by the quantum mechanical impossibility of pinning down the location or boundary of the electrons that make up the atoms. Where and what is the surface? Without a surface, we cannot talk about a surface area, but a Platonic sphere should have a surface that is exactly equal to 4 πr 2 , where r is the radius. But the notion of surface has no rigorous basis in physics at the atomic scale.

Figure 2.2 Plato and Aristotle in a detail of The School of Athens, a fresco by Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (Raphael) in the Vatican. Aristotle is on the right, gesturing toward the earth, indicating that knowledge arises from the study of things, whereas Plato, on the left, gestures toward the heavens, indicating that knowledge is discovery of Forms that exist in an ideal, disembodied world, independent of humans.

So in what sense does the Platonic sphere exist independent of humans? It does not exist in the physical world. We can construct a mathematical model of a sphere, but this is still a human construction not a disembodied truth. For example, we can give a mathematical model of a sphere as follows. A sphere with radius r centered at coordinates (0, 0, 0) in a Cartesian coordinate system is the set of points ( x , y , z ) that satisfy

It is no accident that there is nothing sexy about such a Platonic model.

Figure 2.3 A model of a horse being printed by a 3D printer. [Photo by Ben Zhang, courtesy of the photographer.]

Figure 2.4 Aspirational self-portrait of the author.

The mathematical model of equation (2048) is a human construction, given in the language of algebra and the Cartesian three-dimensional model of space. It can be viewed as an imperfect (i.e., wrong) model of things in the physical world that resemble spheres. Those things in the physical world can be viewed as models of a mental concept of a sphere, as can the equation. But nowhere is there any direct evidence of a human-independent existence of the Platonic Ideal sphere. The mathematical model is not a Platonic Form, but rather at best a model of a Platonic Form, existing within a modeling paradigm (algebra and Cartesian space). There are many other ways to model a sphere mathematically, and as I will discuss in chapter 9 , every such way has limitations. So even an abstract model is a shadow on the wall. Even if it is just a shadow on the wall, it will be more faithful to a Platonic Form of a sphere than any physical model could be. It may be the best representation accessible to us of the Platonic Ideal.

A concrete model of a horse is shown in figure 2.3 being printed by a 3D printer. That printer accepts as input a file containing another kind of model of a horse. Specifically, the file uses a language called STL (for STereoLithography) that is widely used to specify three-dimensional shapes. The STL language was created in 1987 by 3D Systems, headquartered in Rock Hill, South Carolina, a company that makes and sells 3D printers.

A model of a horse in STL is an abstract model. It is based on a paradigm for modeling three-dimensional shapes in terms of two-dimensional facets that share edges. An example of an extremely simple STL model is shown in figure 2.5 . The STL text on the left specifies the pyramid shape at the upper right. It consists of four triangles that form the outer boundary of the object. The vertices of the four triangles are given in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

To fully understand the text in the figure, one needs to first assimilate the paradigm on which STL is based. If you will forgive a brief nerd storm, that paradigm is of three-dimensional tessellations of two-dimensional facets, together with rules such as the right-hand rule, which determines which side of a facet is inside versus outside the shape. If you had studied computer graphics, the previous sentence would be easy to read. Otherwise, probably not.

The STL file for the horse being printed in figure 2.3 is much more complicated than the pyramid, so I will not attempt to show it to you here. It is meant to be read by machines not by humans. The horse model is rendered from the STL file at the lower right in figure 2.5 , where if you look closely, you can see the two-dimensional facets that define the shape. Such a model of a horse is sometimes called a virtual prototype because it serves the same purpose as a physical prototype, but it does not have a physical form.

Models are expressed in some physical medium. The concrete model of a horse in figure 2.3 is a three-dimensional printed plastic prototype. The physical medium is plastic as assembled by a 3D printer. An abstract model of the same design might be a mathematical formula describing its shape, like equation (2048), or an STL file such as that in figure 2.5 . This abstract model can be sent to a 3D printer to produce the concrete model. Abstract models also have physical form in the sense that equation (2048) is ink on a page (or pixels on a screen) and an STL file is aligned magnetic iron molecules on a disk or electric charges in a computer memory, but their physical form is incidental. When an abstract model is converted from one physical form to another, for example, into your mental state when you read equation (2048), or when you copy an STL file from one computer to another, we do not end up with two models. It is still just one model, albeit in two or more physical representations. The ontology of an abstract model is independent of its physical embodiment.

Figure 2.5 Three-dimensional shape specified in STL.

Concrete models are exemplars in physical form of a class, whereas abstract models are abstractions of a class. The possibilities for expressive media are much richer for abstract models than for concrete models because they are less constrained by the physical world. STL, in fact, can specify shapes that cannot exist in the physical world, with overlapping facets or facets that do not share edges. Modeling languages are abstract not concrete. They yield more readily to human creativity. Moreover, they invite invention, and even paradigm shifts. A well-chosen modeling language enables elegant expression of complex designs.

Both concrete and abstract models can be used for analysis. A physical prototype of a component, for example, can be used to determine whether the part that it models will fit properly within its housing. But abstract models offer much richer possibilities for analysis. If the modeling medium, the language in which the models are expressed, has a rigorous semantics, then the model may be subject to automated analysis. A computer program can determine whether the component will fit within its housing without ever having to construct a physical prototype.

Figure 2.6 shows a prototype, a concrete model, of an incandescent lightbulb made with a carbonized bamboo filament. This prototype was made in Thomas Edison's lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey. According to The Edison Papers Project (2016), Edison initially tried to make lamps with platinum wire filaments because the metal has a high melting point. But he discovered that when heated in air, the metal would change its structure, weakening the filament, and the melting point would drop. He solved this problem by putting the filament in a vacuum bulb.

Edison was well known for a style of invention that I will call prototype and test . To find a material for the filament that would produce a reasonable amount of light with a reasonable voltage and lifespan, Edison tried many alternatives. Although his starting point, platinum, worked reasonably well in a vacuum, platinum is an expensive precious metal. Edison's platinum bulbs were likely to be too expensive to become commercial successes. Also from The Edison Papers Project (2016),

He turned to carbon and experimented with some cotton threads, different kinds of paper and cardboard, various woods, and then with a few long fiber plant materials before settling on bamboo. Later he had a worldwide search conducted to see if he could find a better long fiber plant as he did not hold the key patents on artificial fibers, which were beginning to prove better.

This is an Aristotelian approach to solving a problem: experiment with materials and infer their properties from observation. The problem he was trying to solve was how to use electricity to generate light. As a side effect of this engineering work, he did some science, discovering a property of the natural world. Specifically, he found that a naturally occurring metal, platinum, when heated in air, changes its structure.

Bamboo filament lightbulbs went into production in 1882 and about six years later were supplanted with tungsten filament bulbs. Both of these styles require operating in a vacuum, otherwise the filament will burn, melt, or otherwise quickly degrade. Edison's discovery that heated metals degrade in air and do not degrade in a vacuum, a scientific fact, became central to the development of a practical lightbulb, an engineering invention.

Thomas Edison used an abstract model of what happens in an incandescent lightbulb, in addition to the physical prototypes. Specifically, he used Ohm's law, first published by Georg Simon Ohm in 1827. Ohm's law relates the current i through a resistor to the voltage v across the resistor by

where the proportionality constant R is called the resistance . The resistance, which has units of ohms in honor of Georg Ohm, is a property of the material used to make the resistor and the geometry of the resistor. A lightbulb filament is a resistor, and in Edison's day, the resistance of a filament would have been determined empirically.

Because of its resistance, the filament heats up, and it is because of the heat that the filament generates light. Platinum conducts electricity easily, which means that its resistance is low. Carbon-based materials, such as bamboo fibers, have much higher resistance. At a fixed voltage v , therefore, the current that flows through a platinum filament will be much higher than the current that flows through a bamboo filament. The low resistance of platinum is therefore another disadvantage, along with its high cost. To accommodate the higher currents that result from low resistance, Edison would have had to use thicker copper wires to deliver electricity to the lightbulbs, driving up system cost.

Ohm's law is an abstract model. Unlike the model in figure 2.6 , there is nothing physical about this model. It nevertheless represents the「essence of things」and yet, in a true Aristotelian manner, was likely derived by Ohm from observation and measurement rather than from fundamental truths.

Ohm's law can be viewed as a law of nature, in which case it must be true of any electrical circuit. Alternatively, we can view Ohm's law as the definition of「resistance」and「resistor.」Under the latter interpretation, any device is a resistor if the current that flows through it is proportional to the voltage across it (i.e., if its behavior conforms with the model given in equation [1024]).

The distinction between these two interpretations is subtle but important. First, note that there is an implicit assumption in equation (1024) that we are talking about the current i and voltage v at an instant in time. In almost all electrical circuits, the current and voltage vary with time. For a lightbulb, the current and voltage are both zero when the light switch is turned off and are nonzero when the switch is on, so clearly there is a dependence on time.

A key question now becomes whether the resistance R should also vary with time. It turns out that neither platinum nor bamboo will satisfy equation (1024) with a constant value of resistance. In fact, the resistance varies with the temperature of the material, and the temperature depends on the current. If the filament starts out cold, then as current flows through it, the material will heat up and its resistance will increase. If the filament heats up too much, then the material melts and resistance becomes infinite (no current flows). Hence, the current depends not only on the voltage now, at an instant in time, but also on the history of the voltage and current at earlier times. How long the lightbulb has been on will affect its temperature and hence the current.

So it won't work to fix the resistance R to be constant. We have to let it vary with time. But then we have a conundrum. If R is an empirically determined value, then Ohm's law becomes a tautology! It is trivially true of every electrical circuit. At any instant in time, the resistance is

which is just a rearrangement of equation (1024). Every electrical circuit with nonzero voltage and current trivially satisfies Ohm's law by simply using R as defined in equation (512) as the definition of the resistance. This defines the resistance at time t to be whatever value makes Ohm's law true! Surely Georg Ohm did not get a basic electrical unit named after him for discovering a tautology. So this cannot be the right interpretation.

One resolution of this conundrum is that the notion of a resistor is a Platonic Ideal Form. A resistor is a device that at all times satisfies equations (1024) and (512) with a constant resistance R . But there is no such device in the physical world. At a minimum, every known material has a resistance that depends on temperature. Moreover, most every known material heats up as current flows through it. [1]

Besides temperature, other physical effects, specifically inductance and capacitance , ensure that physical materials do not exactly obey Ohm's law with a constant R . These effects introduce memory and dynamics in the system. For example, inductance is the tendency for current that is flowing to keep flowing, even if the voltage drops to zero. A material with nonzero inductance will take some time to adjust the current to a new voltage. During that time, it will not satisfy Ohm's law with the same fixed constant R . All materials, in practice, have some nonzero inductance, even if small. [2]

In fact, no physical object is a resistor. Because no physical object obeys Ohm's law, how can we take this to be a law of nature? Plato's allegory of the cave states that human perception is limited to shadows of reality, but it appears that physical objects are but shadows of the Platonic Ideal Form of a resistor. This Platonic Form is not only inaccessible to humans, it is also inaccessible to nature!

As a consequence, Ohm's law is either trivial or wrong. I see no choice but to conclude that Ohm's law is a human-constructed model, not a fundamental truth about nature. It did not exist as a fundamental truth before Georg Ohm because no physical object in the world obeys it. To the extent that it is a fundamental truth, it is so because we declare it to be so. We define a「resistor」to be a physical object whose behavior is reasonably closely modeled by Ohm's equation, and we define the resistance to be the ratio of voltage across that object to current through that object. An ideal resistor, which does not exist in nature, does not in fact exist at all except in the human mind. Ohm's law was invented, not discovered.

[1] An exception occurs when some materials, called superconductors , are cooled below a critical threshold where they enter a superconductive state, where the resistance becomes exactly zero. But the temperatures required are extremely cold. In 1987, Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller got the Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering a「high temperature superconductor.」Their ceramic compound exhibited superconductivity at the「high」temperature of −243.15 degrees Celsius or −405.67 degrees Fahrenheit. As of this writing, the highest temperature at which superconductivity has been observed is about −70° C (−94° F ), still extremely cold, and even then only at extremely high pressures. No practical lightbulb could be expected to work only at such temperatures and pressures.

[2] An imperfect analogy might help the reader if the reader has not studied electricity. An electric current can be visualized as water flowing down a sluice or channel that is tilted. The degree of tilt is analogous to the voltage. The rate of water flow is analogous to the current. A smaller channel will have a higher resistance than a larger channel (the smaller channel lets through less water for a given tilt). Inductance is analogous to the tendency of water that is flowing to keep flowing (it has inertia). If water is flowing down a tilted sluice and you suddenly flatten the sluice, removing the tilt, the water will not instantly stop flowing. This analogy is imperfect for several reasons. Electric current does not have inertia, or at least not much, and inductance is a property of the channel not the current. But it nevertheless provides a nice visual analogy that can be used to get the basic idea.

2.2 大自然的模型

韦氏在线词典对「模型」一词至少有 14 种定义。其中只有少数与模型在科学和工程中的应用有关：

4 通常是某个事物的缩影，也就是要制作的某个事物的模式；

5 模仿或仿制的例子；

……

7 原型；

……

11 一种描述或类比，用来帮助将无法直接观察到的事物（如原子）形象化；

12 一个由假设、数据和推论组成的系统，其被表示为一个实体或事态的数学描述；也是基于这种系统的计算机模拟。

第一个定义是一个具体的模型，是物理世界中的一个物质对象。而最后两个是抽象的模型，就后两者而言，诸如纸上的墨水等任何物质实现都是偶然的。而中间的其他两个则可以是具体的模型，也可以是抽象的模型。抽象模型和具体模型都有助于人类掌握概念。这两种模型都是人类创造的。因此，模型可以作为人类记录和交流概念的一种方式。

对于亚里士多德来说，关于世界的概念来自特定事物的共同属性（见图 2.2）。特定的事物可以作为符合这个概念的一系列事物的模型，也可以作为这个概念本身的模型。例如，马的概念是通过观察几匹马得出的一种概括性概念。一个外形为马的塑料雕像，如图 2.3 所示，就可以作为马的具体模型。请读者注意，模型本身并不需要是一匹真实的马。一个具体的模型是一个能够捕捉被建模事物的某些本质的实际存在。

1-2-3『此时又想到了斯科特的《模型思维》，视频课也收集好了。这本书一定要研读完。（2021-10-24）』—— 未完成

一个有关具体模型的概念与《韦氏大词典》中的另一个定义联系在一起，即「受雇去展示衣服或其他商品的人」，如图 2.4 所示海报中的模型。这个模型大概是被用来展示某个品牌的香水的，然而，有趣的是，海报所宣传的商品「古龙水」并没有出现在海报中。相反，这个模型被用来代表一个「魅力男子」的经典形象（当然，我指的是海报上的那个人，而不是镜子中反射出来的那个人）。该模型（一个人）被用作一个代表魅力男子形象的模型（原型）。这样一个模型的目的是通过唤起某些人「自己喷了古龙水会变得多么有魅力」的遐想，而将古龙水卖给这些人（也许就是镜子里的这个人）。

图 2.2 《雅典学院》是拉斐尔在梵蒂冈创作的一幅壁画。亚里士多德站在右边，手心向着地球，表示知识源于对事物的研究。而柏拉图站在左边，手指向天空，表明知识是对存在于一个理想的、无形的且独立于人类世界的型相的发现。

图 2.4 作者梦寐以求的自画像。

柏拉图认为，柏拉图型相作为无形的真理独立于人类而存在。柏拉图式的球体是理想的，但是，我们在物理世界中找不到这种理想的球体。它不是也不可能作为一个物理对象而存在。球体的任何物理形式都将是一些由原子和分子构成的物质组成的。无论它被打磨得多么光滑，球体的表面都不会符合柏拉图式的理想球体概念，任何球体表面都会有波动不平的痕迹，以及由于构成原子的电子的位置或边界所具有的量子力学的不可确定性造成的模糊性。表面到底在哪里？表面是什么？如果没有一个表面，我们就不能谈论表面积的问题，但是一个柏拉图式的球体应该有一个正好等于 4πr2 的表面积，其中 r 是球的半径。然而，在原子的尺度上，表面的概念并没有严格的物理学基础。

那么柏拉图式的球体在何种意义上独立于人类而存在呢？结论是它并不存在于物理世界之中。我们可以建立一个球体的数学模型，但是，它仍然是一个人类的构造，而不是无形的真理。例如，我们可以给出一个球体的数学模型。在笛卡儿的坐标系中，以坐标 (0, 0, 0) 为圆心、r 为半径的球体是满足如下条件的点 (x, y, z) 的集合。

毫无疑问，这样一个柏拉图式的模型一点儿都不令人着迷。

方程（2 048）的数学模型是人类用代数语言和笛卡儿空间三维模型构造的。它可以被视为物理世界中事物的、类似球体的不理想（即错误）模型。物理世界中的这些东西可以被视为球体的心理概念模型，就像方程一样。但是，没有任何直接证据表明，柏拉图式的理想球体是独立于人类而存在的。数学模型并不是柏拉图型相，充其量不过是柏拉图型相的模型，存在于建模范式（代数和笛卡儿空间）之中。还有许多其他的方式可以用数学方法建模一个球体，正如我将在第 9 章中讨论的那样，每种方法都有其局限性。所以即使是一个抽象的模型也只是墙上的影子罢了。当然，即使只是墙上的一个影子，它也比任何物理模型更接近一个柏拉图式的球体。它可能是我们所能得到的柏拉图式理想的最佳代表。

图 2.3 所示的是由 3D 打印机打印出来的马的具体模型。该打印机以包含马的模型的另一类文件作为输入。具体来说，该文件使用了一种被称为 STL 的语言（STereoLithography，光固化立体造型术的缩写），其被广泛运用于描述并建立三维形状。STL 语言是由总部设在南卡罗来纳州罗克希尔的 3D 系统公司在 1987 年创建的，这是一家家生产和销售 3D 打印机的公司。

用 STL 语言建立的马的模型是一个抽象模型。它是一个基于共享边的二维面来建模三维形状的范式。图 2.5 给出了一个非常简单的 STL 模型的例子。左边的 STL 文本描述了右上角的金字塔形状。它由四个构成物体外边界的三角形组成。在一个三维笛卡儿坐标系中，给出了这四个三角形的顶点。

要完全理解图中的文本，首先需要明白 STL 所基于的范式。如果你愿意原谅一场短暂的技术呆子头脑风暴，那就请继续阅读下面这段内容。这个范式就是二维平面的三维镶嵌，以及诸如右手定则之类的规则，右手定则决定了一个面的哪一边位于形状的内部而不是外部。如果你学过计算机图形学的话，上面的内容就很容易理解，否则，就可能有些难度。

打印图 2.3 所示马的 STL 文件要比金字塔复杂得多，所以我不打算在这里继续阐述了。它注定是由机器而不是人类来阅读的。马的模型是由图 2.5 右下角的 STL 文件来呈现的。如果读者仔细观察的话，就可以看到定义这个形状的二维平面。这种马的模型有时被称为虚拟原型，因为它的用途与物理原型相同，只是它没有物理形式。

模型是以某些物理介质来呈现的。图 2.3 中马的具体模型是一个三维打印的塑料原型。物理介质是由 3D 打印机用来打印组装的塑料。同一设计的抽象模型可以是描述其形状的数学公式，如方程（2 048）也可以是图 2.5 所示的 STL 文件。这个抽象模型可以被发送到 3D 打印机生成具体的模型。从某种意义上说，抽象模型也具有物理形式，如方程（2 048）是页面上的墨迹（或屏幕上的像素），而 STL 文件是排列在磁盘上的磁性铁分子或计算机内存中的电荷。但是，它们的物理形式是偶然性的。当抽象模型从一种物理形式转换为另一种物理形式的时候，例如，当你读取方程（2 048）时，或者当你将 STL 文件从一台计算机复制到另一台计算机时，我们最终得到的并不是两个模型。

图 2.5 用 STL 制作的 3D 模型。

这仍然只是一个模型，尽管有两个或更多的物理表示。抽象模型的本体论独立于其物理具象。

具体模型是某个类的一些物理形式范例，而抽象模型是某个类的一些抽象。对于抽象模型来说，其表现媒介的可能性要比具体模型丰富得多，因为它们很少受到物理世界的限制。事实上，STL 文件可以建立物理世界中不存在的形状，如一组重叠的平面或不共享边的平面。建模语言是抽象的，而非具体的，它们更容易激发人类的创造力。此外，它们还会带来发明，甚至是范式的转换。设计人员精心选择的建模语言能够优雅地表达设计。

具体模型和抽象模型都可以用于分析。例如，可以使用组件的物理原型来确定它所建模的组件是否适合其外壳。但是，抽象模型为分析提供了更丰富的可能性。如果建模媒介（用于表达模型的语言）具有严格的语义，那么模型可能会进行自动分析。计算机程序可以确定一个组件是否适合其外壳，而无须构建物理原型。

图 2.6 是用碳化竹灯丝制成的白炽灯泡的原型，它是一个具体的模型。这个原型是在新泽西州门洛帕克的托马斯·爱迪生实验室制作的。根据爱迪生论文计划（2016），爱迪生最初尝试用铂丝制作灯丝，因为这种金属具有很高的熔点。但后来他发现，当在空气中加热这种金属时，它的结构会发生改变，这削弱了灯丝的功能且使其熔点降低。最后，他通过把灯丝装在真空灯泡里解决了这个问题。

爱迪生以一种我们称为原型 — 测试的发明风格闻名于世。为了找到一种能产生适量的光、有稳定的电压和使用寿命的灯丝材料，爱迪生做了许多尝试。虽然在最初，金属铂在真空状态下也能很好地工作，然而铂是一种昂贵的贵金属，爱迪生制作的铂金灯泡很可能因为太过昂贵而无法在商业上取得成功。以下内容同样来自爱迪生论文计划（2016）：

图 2.6 托马斯·爱迪生的白炽灯泡和碳化竹灯丝原型。（特伦 - 爱迪生灯泡公司供图，知识共享署名许可 2.0 授权。作者对原文进行了删减，原文来自维基共享资源。）

他转向了碳类材料，并尝试使用一些棉线、不同种类的纸和纸板以及各种木材做实验，然后还试过几根长纤维植物材料，最终选定了竹子。后来，他在全球范围内进行了一次大搜索，以确定是否能找到更好的长纤维植物，那时他还没有获得人造纤维的关键专利，而这些人造纤维将被证实是更好的材料。

爱迪生的方法是一种亚里士多德式的问题解决方法：用材料进行实验，并从观察中推断出不同材料的特质。他试图解决的问题是如何用电来产生光。作为这项工程的辅助性工作，他也做了一些科学工作，结果竟然发现了自然界的一种特性。具体来说，他发现自然界中存在的金属铂在空气中被加热时其结构会发生改变。

竹丝灯泡于 1882 年投入生产，大约 6 年后被钨丝灯泡取代。这两种类型的灯丝都需要在真空中工作，否则灯丝会燃烧、熔化或迅速降解。爱迪生发现加热的金属在空气中会降解，在真空中则不会，这一科学事实是一项工程发明，并成为开发实用灯泡的核心支撑。

除了物理原型，托马斯·爱迪生还使用了白炽灯泡工作过程中涉及的抽象模型。具体来说，他使用了欧姆定律。该定律由乔治·西蒙·欧姆在 1827 年首次发表。欧姆定律把通过电阻的电流 i 与电阻器两端的电压 v 联系起来。

i = v/R（1 024）

其中的比例常数 R 为阻值。阻值的单位是欧姆，这样命名是为了纪念乔治·欧姆。阻值是用来制作电阻器的材料及电阻器几何形状的一种性质。灯泡的灯丝是电阻，在爱迪生的时代，灯丝的阻值是靠经验推算出来的。

因为阻值的存在，所以灯丝可以被加热，而正是因为灯丝被加热，它也才会发光。金属铂容易导电，这意味着它的阻值很低。诸如竹纤维等碳基材料则具有高得多的阻值，因此，在固定的电压 v 下，流经铂丝的电流要比流经竹丝的电流大得多。因此，金属铂除了成本很高，低阻值也是它的一个缺点。为了应对低电阻产生的高电流，爱迪生将不得不使用更粗的铜线向灯泡供电，从而推高了系统成本。

欧姆定律是一个抽象模型。与图 2.6 中所示的模型不同，该模型没有任何物理特性。尽管如此，它仍然代表了「事物的本质」。然而，如果我们以一种真正的亚里士多德的方式来解释的话，该定律就很可能是欧姆从观察和测量中得出的，而不是从基本真理中得出的。

欧姆定律可以被视为一条自然法则，在这种情况下，它对任何电路必须都成立。换言之，我们可以把欧姆定律看作「阻值」和「电阻」的定义。根据后一种解释，如果流经它的电流与它两端的电压成正比，那么任何装置都是一个电阻［也就是说，其行为是否符合方程（1 024）给出的模型］。

这两种解释之间的区别十分微妙，但很重要。首先，请注意，在方程（1 024）中有一个隐含的假设，即我们所讨论的是瞬时的电流 i 和电压 v。在几乎所有的电路中，电流和电压都是随时间的变化而变化的。对于一个灯泡来说，电流和电压在电灯开关断开时都为零，而当灯泡的开关接通时，电流和电压都不是零，所以很明显，电流和电压的变化都与时间有关。

现在的一个关键性问题是，阻值 R 是否也会随着时间的变化而变化。结果表明，铂和竹丝都不满足表示恒定阻值的方程（1 024）。事实上，这些材料的阻值会随着材料温度的变化而变化，其温度又取决于电流。如果灯丝一开始是冷却的，那么当电流流过它的时候，灯丝的材料就会变热，其阻值就会增大。如果灯丝过热，材料就会熔化，阻值就会变得无穷大（没有电流流动）。因此，在某一时刻，电流不仅取决于当前的电压，也取决于电压和电流在前期的状况。灯泡点亮的时间会影响它的温度，从而也会影响电流。

所以，把阻值 R 固定为常数是行不通的。我们必须让它随时间的变化而变化。但在此时，我们会遇到一个难题。如果阻值 R 是一个根据经验确定的值，那么欧姆定律就变成了一个恒真的命题！也就是说，每个电路都是如此。在任何瞬间，电阻都等于电压除以电流：

R = v/i（512）

这不过是方程（1 024）的另一种形式。通过简单地将方程（512）中的 R 作为阻值的定义，每一个非零电压和非零电流的电路就都应满足欧姆定律。这就将 t 时刻的阻值定义为使得欧姆定律成立的任何值！当然，乔治·欧姆并没有因为发现了一个恒真命题而获得一个以他的名字命名的基本电子元件。所以，这不可能是正确的解释。

解决这个难题的一个办法在于，将电阻的概念作为一种柏拉图式的理想型相。电阻是一个在任何时候都能满足方程（1 024）和（512）且具有恒定阻值 R 的器件。但是在物理世界里没有这样的器件。至少，每一种已知材料的阻值都会受到温度变化的影响。此外，大多数已知的材料都会在电流流过时发热。除温度以外的其他物理效应，特别是电感和电容，都会确保物理材料不可能完全以常数 R 来遵守欧姆定律。这些效应在系统中带入了记忆和动力学。例如，即使电压降到零，电感也是电流持续流动的趋势。非零电感的材料需要一些时间才能将电流调整到新的电压。在此期间，它不能以同样规定不变的常数 R 来满足欧姆定律。

实际上，所有材料都带有非零的电感，即使很小。事实上，没有任何物理对象是电阻，因为没有任何物理对象可以遵循欧姆定律，那么我们又怎么能把欧姆定律当作一条自然法则呢？在柏拉图的关于洞穴的寓言中，人类的感知局限于现实的影子，但物理对象似乎只是电阻的柏拉图式理想型相的影子。这种柏拉图式的型相是人类无法接触的，也是大自然无法接触的！

因此，欧姆定律要么是微不足道的，要么就是错误的。我不得不得出这样的结论 —— 欧姆定律是一个人类构建的模型，而不是关于自然的基本真理。在乔治·欧姆提出欧姆定律之前，它并不作为一个基本存在，因为世界上没有任何物理对象遵守它。在某种程度上，它之所以能够成为一个真理，是因为我们宣称它是真理。我们将「电阻」定义为一个物理对象，其行为与欧姆定律的方程所建模的行为非常接近，我们将阻值定义为该对象两端的电压与通过该对象的电流的比值。除了在人的头脑中，自然界中并不存在一个理想的电阻。因此，欧姆定律是被发明的，不是被发现的。

### 2.3 Models Are Wrong

Modeling is central to every scientific and engineering enterprise. Solomon Wolf Golomb (1932–2016), who has written eloquently about the use of models in science and engineering, emphasizes understanding the distinction between a model and thing being modeled. He famously stated,「You will never strike oil by drilling through the map」(Golomb, 1971). A map is a model. The territory is the thing being modeled. You should drill through the territory, not the map.

For both scientists and engineers, the「thing being modeled」is typically an object, process, or system in the physical world. [3] Let us call the thing being modeled the target of the model. The fidelity of a model is the degree to which it emulates the target.

When the target is a physical object, process, or system, the model fidelity is never perfect. Box and Draper (1987) state,「essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.」The model in figure 2.4 is not useful (at least not to me). Ohm's law, in contrast, is quite useful. It models certain physical devices, such as Edison's lightbulb filaments. Although it models them imperfectly, Edison used this model to understand that a bamboo filament was a better choice than a platinum filament in a lightbulb.

A useful model has to have a purpose, and the fidelity of the model needs to be evaluated against that purpose. Ohm's law, as a model for a lightbulb, will tell Edison how much current will flow through the filament, but it will not tell him how much light will be generated. A different model is needed for that purpose.

Note that a model may be「useful」in ways that are not practical or mercenary. Merriam-Webster defines「useful」as「helping to do or achieve something.」That「something」may be further intellectual inquiry or pure science. That is, a model may be useful because it explains or predicts a phenomenon even if there is no practical application for that phenomenon. Einstein's model of gravitational waves is useful because, among other things, it suggests a way to observe the collision of black holes, as done by LIGO, even if we have no practical use for colliding black holes.

When using models, it is important to apply them only within their regime of applicability, which is limited for all models. Ohm's law, by itself, will not be applicable to a resistor that has melted. Gravitational waves are not useful when studying the interactions of subatomic particles. [4]

Models are generally more useful when their fidelity is higher. So how do we get good model fidelity? We have two different mechanisms available to us. We can either choose (or invent) a model that is faithful to the target, or we can choose (or invent) a target that is faithful to the model. The former is the essence of what a scientist does. The latter is the essence of what an engineer does. Both require assuming that the target is operating within some regime of applicability of the model.

Edison was a quintessential engineer of his time. In selecting a lightbulb filament (a target), among other properties (durability, tolerance for high temperature), Edison needed a filament that was well modeled by Ohm's law. Suppose that Edison had chosen instead a filament that was well modeled by a different law known as Faraday's law of induction. This choice would have resulted in a poor lightbulb. If you will indulge me a brief nerd storm, I will attempt to explain why.

As I pointed out before, inductance is the tendency for current that is flowing to keep flowing, even if the voltage drops to zero. An inductor is a device that resists changes in current, as opposed to a resistor, which simply resists current. By analogy, a resistor is like a lazy person and an inductor is like a stubborn person. It takes more effort to get a lazy person to work for you and to keep him working, whereas once a stubborn person is working at something, that person will keep working at it (like me with this book). A person may be both lazy and stubborn, just as a physical device may have both resistance and inductance.

In one of the simpler forms of Faraday's law, the current i and voltage v of an inductor are related by [5]

where the constant L is called the inductance. [6] This equation states that the voltage v ( t ) at time t is proportional to the rate of change of current i at time t , where the proportionality constant is L . This means that if the current changes rapidly, the voltage is high. Vice versa, if the voltage is high, the current changes rapidly.

According to Wikipedia, Electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832. Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments. (Retrieved March 15, 2016)

We might be tempted to change「discovered」to「invented」on the Wikipedia page, but that would not be quite right. The word「discovered」is correct for induction but not for equation (256). Equation (256) is an invention. It is an idealized model, and just like Ohm's law, no physical object perfectly obeys it (with constant L ). As a model, therefore, it is wrong, but it is extremely useful.

Kuhn (1962) takes a stand on the relationship between discovery and invention, stating,「Discovery and invention are inseparable because the theory to explain the discovery must occur for the discovery to occur.」The discovery that a current that is flowing tends to keep flowing (inductance) and that this property is accentuated in certain devices (inductors) is inextricably linked to the model represented in equation (256), in the sense that some form of this model has to be understood to recognize the discovery. This link between discovery and invention, Kuhn says, also makes it much more difficult to pinpoint a discovery, assigning it to a particular person at a particular time:

· · · the sentence,「Oxygen was discovered,」misleads by suggesting that discovering something is a single simple act assimilable to our usual (and also questionable) concept of seeing. That is why we so readily assume that discovering, like seeing or touching, should be unequivocally attributable to an individual and to a moment in time. But the latter attribution is always impossible, and the former often is as well. (Kuhn, 1962, p. 55)

Discoveries never occur at an instant in time and are rarely properly attributable to an individual. The messiness with the discovery of the transistor effect, leading to a Nobel Prize, years after the transistor had been patented as an invention, underscores this point.

Let me illustrate how Edison might have used the model of inductance in equation (256). Suppose that he had chosen as a lightbulb filament an inductor like those in figure 2.8 . The first problem he would have run into is that these filaments would not have generated any light. But this would only be the start of his problems. Suppose for simplicity that L = 1 henry. [7] Suppose that we now apply a constant voltage of one volt to the lightbulb. By equation (256), the rate of change of current becomes

This has units of amps per second. It means that for every second that passes, the current increases by one amp. If the current is initially zero when we turn on the lightbulb, then after 10 seconds, the current will be 10 amps. After one minute, the current will be 60 amps. After one hour, the current will be 3,600 amps. After a few days, the house will have burned down, the transformer on the power pole outside the house will have blown up, and the electric bill will have become more than the cost of a college education. Edison would not have been able to sell us more than one such lightbulb. [8]

I have already concluded that both Ohm's law and Faraday's law are wrong, in the sense that no physical object obeys either law exactly. But a bamboo fiber in a vacuum bulb comes pretty close to obeying Ohm's law, and a coil of copper around an iron core, as on the left in figure 2.8 , comes pretty close to obeying Faraday's law. However, in both cases, the model is wrong.

Edison was an engineer, but he also made contributions to science, and he relied heavily on experimentation, as many scientists do. To a scientist, the value of a model lies in how well its properties match those of a target, typically an object found in nature. The value of Ohm's and Faraday's laws lies in how well they describe the properties of some object under study. But to an engineer such as Edison, the value of an object, say a bamboo fiber, lies in how well its properties match a model, in this case, Ohm's law. Edison understood enough about electricity to know that an inductive filament would be of no use. Instead, he knew that he needed a filament for which Ohm's law was a faithful model (and that also generated light), and he went about the task of finding a filament (a target) for that model.

According to Popper's philosophy of science, a scientific model, a「theory,」must be falsifiable to be scientific. Under this principle, Ohm's and Faraday's laws are either unscientific or false. If the laws are tautologies, then they are not falsifiable, and if not, then no physical object obeys them, so they are false. Ohm's and Faraday's laws are useful not true .

In what Simon might have called the「sciences of the natural,」to distinguish them from the「sciences of the artificial,」a scientist is, by definition, given the target. It exists in nature. Such a scientist constructs models to help understand the target. An engineer, in contrast, constructs targets to emulate the properties of a model. An engineer uses or invents models for things that do not exist and then tries to construct physical objects (targets) for which the models are reasonably faithful. For an engineer, a model provides a design and the target is the implementation . The task is to find an implementation that is faithful to the model.

These two uses of models are complementary. Engineers and scientists will typically use models both ways. Edison spent a great deal of effort characterizing the electrical properties of all sorts of natural materials before settling on bamboo fibers. Good engineering requires doing good science. And at least for experimental science, good science requires doing good engineering, as we saw in the last chapter with the LIGO gravitational wave detector.

In both cases, the models are wrong. In engineering, a model is useful if we can find an implementation that is reasonably faithful to the model. In science, a model is useful if it is reasonably faithful to a target given to us by nature. A scientist asks,「Can I make a model for this thing?」An engineer asks,「Can I make a thing for this model?」

Models are human constructions. Modeling paradigms are also human constructions. Therefore, both are subject to creativity. They are invented not discovered. Because an engineer constructs models for things that do not yet exist, there is much more room for creativity than for a scientist, at least one focusing on the sciences of the natural, who is stuck crafting models for things that already exist. Moreover, I claim that digital technology has smashed open the possibilities for what could exist, so the room for creativity is vast indeed. I examine how digital technology does this in the next chapter.

3 The「thing being modeled」can also be another model. I will examine that issue later in chapter 3 .

4 Penrose (1989) speculates that gravitational waves may in fact be implicated in certain subatomic quantum mechanical phenomena, but as of this writing, there is no experimental corroboration for this thesis and no wide support among physicists.

5 Messerschmitt's law (see footnote on page 2) probably becomes overly conservative when the equation uses calculus, as this one does. I suspect that this equation will drop my readership by more than half, but I will nevertheless stick to the numbering scheme previously established.

6 The units of the inductance L are called「henries」after Joseph Henry. It is customary to use the symbol L for inductance.

7 One henry is actually a very large inductance, but it makes the math simpler and therefore will damage my readership less than a more reasonable choice of, say, one millihenry.

8 Most household circuits in the United States have fuses that trip, interrupting the current, when the current exceeds 15 or 20 amps, so this scenario would not play out this way in your house. Also, the voltage supplied in a household circuit is much larger, typically 170 volts at its peak in the United States (see Lee and Varaiya [2011] sidebar on page 11 for an explanation of household electric power). Hence, during the time that the voltage is 170 volts, the current will increase at a rate of 170 amps per second, which means it will reach 15 amps in 11 milliseconds. At this point, it will trip the fuse, leaving you in the dark. So the bulb would operate for only 11 milliseconds.

2.3 模型是错误的

建模是每一项科学和工程工作的核心。所罗门·沃尔夫·格伦布（1932-2016）曾撰写过关于在科学和工程中应用模型的一篇精彩文章，他强调理解模型和正在被建模的事物之间的区别特别重要。他有一句名言：「通过在地图上钻孔，你永远不会找到石油。」（格伦布，1971）地图就是模型，而土地是被建模的对象。显而易见，你应该在土地上钻井，而不是在地图上（如图 2.7 所示）。

对于科学家和工程师来说，「被建模的事物」通常是物理世界中的一个对象、过程或系统。让我们把被建模的事物称为模型的目标物。模型的保真度就是它模仿目标物的接近程度。

图 2.7 在地图上钻孔。（这张照片由摄影师鲁西·姆切德利什维利提供。）

当目标物是物理对象、过程或系统的时候，模型的保真度永远不会是理想的。博克斯和德雷珀（1987）曾指出：「从本质上讲，所有的模型都是错误的，但有些是有用的。」图 2.4 中给出的模型并没有什么用（至少对我而言是如此）。相反，欧姆定律却是非常有用的模型。它对某些物理装置进行了建模，如爱迪生的灯丝。虽然所建立的模型还不够理想，但它让爱迪生明白竹丝比金属铂丝更适合用来制作灯泡。

一个有用的模型必须有一个目的，并且模型的保真度应该根据这个目的进行评估。作为灯泡的模型，欧姆定律可以告诉爱迪生会有多少电流流过灯丝，但它不会明确告知爱迪生该模型能够产生多少光。为此，我们还需要另一个不同的模型。

请注意，模型可能在不实际或不产生实际效果的方面是「有用的」。《韦氏大词典》对「有用」的定义是「帮助做某事或达成某事」。「某事」可能指的是进一步的知识探索或纯科学。也就是说，一个模型可能是有用的，因为它解释或预测了一种现象，即使它没有对应于这种现象的实际应用。即使我们对黑洞碰撞没有实际应用，爱因斯坦的引力波模型也很有用，因为它提出了一种观察黑洞碰撞的方法，就像激光干涉引力波天文台所做的那样。

在使用模型时，在其适用的范围内应用它们是非常重要的。所有模型都有其适用范围。欧姆定律本身不适用于已经熔化的电阻。引力波在研究亚原子量子的相互作用时也是无用的。模型的保真度越高，它们通常就会越有用。那么，我们如何才能获得良好的保真度呢？我们可以有两种可用的不同机制。我们可以选择（或发明）一个高度符合于目标对象的模型，也可以选择（或发明）一个高度符合于模型的目标对象。前者是科学家工作的本质，后者是工程师工作的本质。两者都要求假设目标对象在模型的某个适用范围内运作。

爱迪生是他那个时代的一名杰出的工程师。在选择灯泡的灯丝（一个目标对象）时，除了耐用性、耐高温性等特性之外，爱迪生还需要一种能由欧姆定律很好地模拟的灯丝。假设爱迪生选择了一种人们熟知的法拉第电磁感应定律所模拟的灯丝，那么这种选择一定会生产出一个非常糟糕的灯泡。请允许我再次进行一场简短的技术呆子风暴，以解释其中的原因。

正如我之前指出的那样，即使电压降为零，电感仍然会维持电流的流动趋势。电感是一种能够抵抗电流变化的装置，而电阻只是一种能够抵抗电流的装置。打个比方，电阻就像一个懒惰的人，而电感就像一个固执的人。要想让一个懒惰的人为你工作并持续工作需要更多的努力，而一个固执的人一旦做了某件事，他就会一直做下去（就像我写这本书一样）。一个人可能既懒惰又固执，就像一个物理装置可能既有电阻又有电感一样。

在法拉第定律的一种较简单的表现形式中，电感的电流 i 和电压 v 具有如下关系：

其中，常数 L 被称作感应系数（即电感值）。这个方程表明，t 时刻的电压 v 与电流 i 的变化率成正比，其中比例常数为 L。这意味着，如果电流变化很快，电压就会升高；反之，如果电压高，电流就会变化很快。

根据维基百科的解释：

电磁感应是由迈克尔·法拉第在 1831 年以及约瑟夫·亨利在 1832 年分别独立发现的。法拉第是第一个公布这个实验结果的人。（2016 年 3 月 15 日检索）

我们可能会试图把维基百科页面上的「发现」改为「发明」，但这并不完全正确。「发现」一词用于电磁感应是正确的，但不适用于方程（256）。方程（256）是一项发明，就像欧姆定律一样。这个方程也是一个理想化的模型，没有物理对象能够完全遵循它（L 为常数）。因此，作为一个模型而言其是错误的，但又是非常有用的。

库恩（1962）就发现和发明之间的关系阐明了自己的观点，他认为「发现和发明是分不开的，因为解释发现的理论必须出现，才能使这个发现真正出现」。正在流动的电流趋向于保持流动（感应系数），以及某些装置（电感）会呈现这一特性的发现，与方程（256）中所表示的模型不可分割地联系在一起。从某种意义上说，必须理解这一模型的某种形式才能认识这一发现。库恩说，发现和发明之间的这种联系，也使得人们很难准确地确定一个发现是谁在什么时候发现的：

……「氧气是被发现的」这句话极大地误导了我们，因为它认为发现某种东西是一种简单的行为，与我们通常（我对此同样表示质疑）所理解的「看」的概念类似。这就是为什么我们如此轻易地认为，发现，就像看或触摸一样，应该明确地归属于某个人和某个时刻。然而，后一种归因总是不可能的，前一种也经常是不可能的。（库恩，1962:55）

发现从来不会在瞬间发生，也很少能完全归因于某个人。晶体管效应的发现获得了诺贝尔奖，这一发现的混乱情况在晶体管作为一项发明而获得专利的数年后更为显著。

让我来解释一下爱迪生可能是如何使用方程（256）中的电感模型的。假设他选择了如图 2.8 所示的电感作为灯泡的灯丝。他遇到的第一个问题就是这种灯丝不会产生任何光。但这只是问题的开始。为了简单起见，假设 L=1 亨利，并假设我们现在给灯泡施加 1 伏特的恒定电压，那么根据方程（256），电流的变化率为：

它的单位是每秒的安培数。这意味着每经过一秒，电流就会增加 1 安培。如果我们接通灯泡时的最初电流为零，那么 10 秒之后，电流将变为 10 安培；1 分钟以后，电流将达到 60 安培；1 小时后，电流将达到 3 600 安培；过不了几天，整栋房子就会被烧毁，房子外面电线杆上的变压器也会爆炸，而电费也将会超过读大学的学费。这样，爱迪生卖给我们的灯泡就不可能超过一个。我已经得出结论 —— 欧姆定律和法拉第定律都是错误的，因为没有任何物理对象能够完全遵守这两条定律。但是，真空灯泡中的竹纤维非常接近遵守欧姆定律，而铁芯周围的铜线圈（如图 2.8 所示）则非常接近遵守法拉第定律。然而，即便是在这两种情况下，模型也是错误的。

爱迪生是一名工程师，但他对科学也做出了巨大贡献。他和许多科学家一样，非常依赖实验。对于科学家来说，模型的价值在于它的特性与目标物（通常是在自然界中发现的对象）属性的匹配程度。欧姆定律和法拉第定律的价值在于它们描述研究对象属性的准确程度。但是，对于像爱迪生这样的工程师来说，一种对象的价值（如竹纤维）取决于它的属性与模型（这里就是欧姆定律）的匹配程度。爱迪生对电有足够的了解，他知道感应灯丝是没用的。相反，他知道他需要一根以欧姆定律为相符模型的灯丝（并且还能产生光），于是，他开始为这个模型寻找一根灯丝（一个目标物）。

根据波普尔的科学哲学，一个科学模型，或者是一种「理论」，在科学上必须是可证伪的。按照这一原则，欧姆定律和法拉第定律要么是不科学的，要么是错误的。如果定律是恒真命题，那么它们是不可证伪的。如果定律不是恒真命题，那么在现实中就没有任何物理对象会遵守它们，所以它们是错误的。欧姆定律和法拉第定律是有用但不正确的。

为了有别于「人工科学」，在西蒙所说的「自然科学」中，科学家根据定义被赋予了这个目标物，其存在于自然界中。这样的科学家建立模型，帮助人们理解该目标物。相比之下，工程师则构建目标物模拟一个模型的特性。工程师为不存在的事物使用或发明模型，然后尝试构造出高度符合于模型的物理对象（目标物）。对于工程师来说，模型提供了一种设计，而目标物是其实现。任务在于，要找到一个高度符合于该模型的实现。

这两种模型的使用是互补的。工程师和科学家通常会以这两种方式使用模型。爱迪生花费了大量精力来研究各种天然材料的电特性，之后才选定竹纤维。因此，好的工程要以好的科学为基础。至少对于实验科学来说，好的科学研究需要好的工程来配合，正如我们在上一章提到的激光干涉引力波天文台的工作一样。

但是，很遗憾，在这两种情形下模型都会是错的。在工程中，如果我们能够找到一个高度符合于模型的实现，那么该模型就是有用的。在科学中，如果一个模型高度符合于大自然给我们的一个目标物，那么这个模型是有用的。科学家常常会问这样的问题：「我能为这个东西构造一个模型吗？」工程师则会问：「我可以为这个模型做点儿什么吗？」

模型是由人类所构造的，建模的范式也是由人类构造的。因此，二者都受制于人类的创造力。它们都是被发明的，而不是被发现的。因为工程师会为尚不存在的事物构造模型，所以和专注于自然科学的科学家相比，他们的创造力空间更大。原因在于，科学家常常被困于为已经存在的事物构造模型。此外，我认为数字技术已经为一切的可能存在打开了可能性，创造力的空间确实是巨大的。我将在下一章分析数字技术是如何做到这一点的。
