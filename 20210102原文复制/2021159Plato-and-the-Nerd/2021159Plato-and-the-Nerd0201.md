Inventing Laws of Nature

· · · in which I argue that models are invented, not discovered; that engineers and scientists use models in complementary, almost opposite ways; that all models are wrong, but some are useful; and that the use of models can slow as well as advance technological progress by establishing a backdrop of unknown knowns, by forcing increased specialization, and by requiring humans to assimilate new paradigms.

2.1 The Unknown Knowns

Drawn by its provocative title, I recently read Inventing Nature , a wonderful book by Andrea Wulf (Wulf, 2015). Wulf's book tells the story of Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), a remarkable Prussian about whom I had previously known nothing except that Humboldt county and Humboldt Redwoods State Park in California, along with numerous other places and things, had been named after him. Wulf boldly states,「Humboldt gave us our concept of nature itself.」Easing somewhat my embarrassment at my ignorance, she goes on,「The irony is that Humboldt's views have become so self-evident that we have largely forgotten the man behind them.」Further easing my embarrassment, Sandra Nichols (2006), in an article titled「Why was Humboldt forgotten in the United States?」reassures me that I am not alone. Nichols postulates many reasons for our collective amnesia, but to me the most poignant is「shifts in scholarship,」where「the search for a comprehensive view of science was soon set aside in favor of specialization.」In Germany, Humboldt and his brother Wilhelm have most definitely not been forgotten. The Humboldt University of Berlin is named after the two of them, and the brother, Wilhelm, is credited with establishing the「Humboldtian model of higher education,」which integrates teaching in the arts and sciences with research. This is a defining principle of all top universities today.

In her claim that Alexander von Humboldt「invented nature,」Wulf shows us that scientific truths can come into existence and then become part of the human psyche, background knowledge that we accept with such tenacity that we no longer think of them as scientific truths. They just are. Wulf summarizes Humboldt's breakthrough:

Humboldt revolutionized the way we see the natural world. He found connections everywhere. Nothing, not even the tiniest organism, was looked at on its own.「In this great chain of causes and effects,」Humboldt said,「no single fact can be considered in isolation.」

Wulf credits Humboldt with being the first scientist to show evidence of human-induced climate change, for founding the field of ecology, and for articulating the first modern notion of「nature」itself. The most astonishing part of this story is that it never occurred to me that the connectedness of nature was not just a simple self-evident truth. It is so widely accepted today that it fades into the background of our basic instinct, along with notions of time and causality. Wulf explains the prevailing scientific thought at Humboldt's time:

Inventions such as telescopes and microscopes revealed new worlds and with them a belief that the laws of nature could be discovered.

But Wulf points out that these laws of nature were understood one phenomenon at a time, as in Newton's laws of motion governing a falling object. Connectedness fell victim to reductionism.

Connectedness faded from our conscious approach to science into the unconscious, part of an unseen background, an unknown known. US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, at a Department of Defense news briefing in 2002, made the following often quoted statement:

· · · as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones [sic]. (Rumsfeld, 2002)

The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek pointed out that Rumsfeld didn't mention an obvious fourth category of knowledge, the「unknown knowns.」These are the things we know but don't know that we know, which Žižek says is「precisely the Freudian unconscious」(Žižek, 2004). The interconnectedness of nature was, until I read Wulf's book, one of my unknown knowns. I didn't know that I knew that. Now I do, and thanks to Wulf, I also now realize that this「truth」that I know was not always known. She credits Humboldt with making it known.

Our unknown knowns bias our thinking. Thomas Kuhn, in his 1964 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , disrupted the prevailing view of science as「development-by-accumulation」(Kuhn, 1962). Instead of an accretion of discovered facts about the world, a scientific discipline is founded on a「paradigm,」a conceptual framework that practitioners use, often unknowingly, to interpret observations and develop theories. Kuhn argued that these paradigms make scientific understanding necessarily subjective.

Observation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible scientific belief, else there would be no science. But they cannot alone determine a particular body of such belief. An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident , is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientific community at a given time. [emphasis added]

Kuhn's「arbitrary element」often takes the form of unknown knowns. A paradigm becomes so widely accepted and strongly held that its subjects no longer know it is there. They accept the paradigm as truth. As argued by Kant, the order we perceive in the world is shaped by our mind, which provides the distorting lens through which we perceive it. We impose order on nature rather than the other way around.

Kuhn's central claim is that scientific revolution, the truly momentous advances that occur from time to time, come about through paradigm shifts rather than through accretion of knowledge. The notion of scientific truth is therefore subjective, defined more by consensus of a scientific community than by Plato's ideal disembodied truth. An obvious corollary is that a paradigm is invented more than discovered.

Kuhn's position was highly controversial. It went very much against the grain of the prevailing philosophy of science, best articulated by Popper, which was about seeking objective truths. In 1965, a colloquium convened in London drew together many of the most prominent thinkers on the philosophy of science to respond to Kuhn's thesis. Imre Lakatos, a Hungarian philosopher of mathematics and science, and co-editor of the proceedings from the colloquium, wrote,「 in Kuhn's view scientific revolution is irrational, a matter for mob psychology 」(Lakatos, 1970, emphasis in the original). He goes on to criticize the notion of a「paradigm shift,」writing that it is

a mystical conversion which is not and cannot be governed by rules of reason and which falls totally within the realm of the (social) psychology of discovery. Scientific change is a kind of religious change. [emphasis in the original]

Despite these objections, Kuhn's notion of governing paradigms is useful for understanding the evolution of scientific thought. It is even more useful for understanding technology, where paradigms can be more obviously subjective.

In our modern technological world, our lives are governed by paradigms that are more obviously invented rather than discovered. These paradigms shape our understanding of the world, becoming unknown knowns. Consider, for example, the fact that in music and performing arts, it used to be that performer and observer had to be in the same room at the same time. Today, we can use Spotify and Hulu, among others, to carry much of the world's music and theater in our pockets, to be enjoyed whenever and wherever we choose. Most of us alive today have been able to listen to music without being in the same room with the musicians. This fact has changed the very meaning of the word「music」in ways that we don't notice. Think, for example, about the meaning of the phrase「my music.」What would that have meant to a citizen of the nineteenth century, before Edison?

I was once telling my wife that a colleague at Berkeley, Miki Lustig, was leading a charge to teach many students, staff, and faculty at Berkeley about amateur radio, and to help them prepare to take the test to become licensed to operate amateur radios. My wife asked me why one would want to operate an amateur radio. The question had never occurred to me, and off the cuff, the best answer I could come up with was,「So they can communicate with anyone around the world.」She asked me,「Why don't they just send email?」I saw a collision of paradigms, less momentous than the collision of two black holes, but nevertheless notable. Being able to communicate instantaneously with anyone around the world has become a background fact, an unknown known, a part of the technological paradigm through which we understand and manage our daily lives.

Paradigms change. Kuhn's scientific paradigms change relatively infrequently, and the changes can be quite disruptive to a scientific community. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , Kuhn quotes Max Planck:

A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.

The same thing happens with technological paradigms. Witness how much of modern technology becomes inaccessible to an aging brain. Our kids accept technological truths that are incomprehensible to older people. In fact, I believe that the pace of technological progress today is more limited by the inability of humans to absorb new paradigms than it is by any physical limitations of the technology.

Kuhn is generous to scientists whose paradigms are later supplanted by better paradigms:

· · · those once current views of nature were, as a whole, neither less scientific nor more the product of human idiosyncrasy than those current today.

· · · If these out-of-date beliefs are to be called myths, then myths can be produced by the same sorts of methods and held for the same sorts of reasons that now lead to scientific knowledge.

We should be similarly generous to humans whose technological paradigms become obsolete, rather than thinking of them as luddites or dinosaurs. I would say to my kids,「Don't worry, you too someday will be a dinosaur.」

Despite similarities, technological paradigms differ from scientific ones in significant ways. Technological paradigms are today much more diverse than scientific paradigms, reflecting immaturity of the field and rapid change. Kuhn argues that scientific paradigms are incommensurable. One paradigm cannot be understood or judged through the conceptual framework and terminology of the other. I will show in chapter 3 that this is less the case for technological paradigms, which may be layered in such a way as to interoperate. Nevertheless, incommensurable paradigms do arise, and it becomes necessary to build a metaparadigm within which to compare technological paradigms. I will attempt to do that through the notion of modeling.

Science, technology, and engineering are all built on models. Models are artifacts in the conceptual framework of a paradigm. Newton's second law, for example, is a model of the motion of an object subjected to a force. It takes the form of an equation, specifically equation (4096) on page 14 , which has meaning in the paradigm of Newton's and Leibniz's calculus, the concept of force, and the Newtonian notion of time and space. If you studied physics in high school, you probably got brainwashed sufficiently that the concepts of force, time, and space are among your unknown knowns. But objectively, Newton gave no physical explanation for these concepts. Instead, he built a self-consistent and self-referential model where each of these concepts is defined in terms of the others, if defined at all.

Every engineered design is similarly a model, which can be as simple as a prototype of a physical shape or as complex as a million lines of code. Each such model has a meaning, a semantics , only within some modeling paradigm. And the modeling paradigm is all too often an unknown known, never articulated or consciously chosen. I will attempt now to break the logjam that is created by failing to recognize these unknown knowns.

2.2 Models of Nature

Merriam-Webster's online dictionary has no fewer than 14 definitions of the word「model.」Only a few of these are relevant to how models are used in science and engineering:

4.

a usually miniature representation of something; also: a pattern of something to be made

5.

an example for imitation or emulation

· · ·

7.

archetype

· · ·

11.

a description or analogy used to help visualize something (as an atom) that cannot be directly observed

12.

a system of postulates, data, and inferences presented as a mathematical description of an entity or state of affairs; also: a computer simulation based on such a system.

The first of these definitions is a concrete model, a material object in the physical world, whereas the last two are abstract models, where any material realization, for example, as ink on paper, is incidental. The two in the middle could be either concrete or abstract. Both abstract and concrete models help humans grasp concepts. Both kinds of models are created by humans. Models, therefore, can serve as a way for humans to record and communicate concepts.

For Aristotle, concepts about the world arise from the common properties of particular things (see figure 2.2 ). Particular things can serve as models for the family of things that fit the concept or as models for the concept itself. The concept of a horse, for example, is a generalization formed from the observation of a few horses. A plastic figurine in the shape of horse, such as the one being printed in figure 2.3 , can serve as a concrete model of a horse. Note that the model need not itself be a horse. A concrete model is a physical thing that captures some essence of the things being modeled.

The notion of a concrete model connects naturally to another of Merriam-Webster's definitions,「one who is employed to display clothes or other merchandise.」Consider the model in the poster shown in figure 2.4 . That model was presumably employed to display something, but interestingly, the merchandise being advertised by this poster, cologne, is not shown on the poster. The model instead was employed to be an exemplar of a「sexy human male」(to be sure, I'm talking about the one in the poster, not the one in the reflection). The model (a human) was employed to serve as a model (an archetype) of a sexy human male. The purpose of such a model is to sell cologne to an individual (perhaps the one in the reflection) by evoking an image of how attractive he might become by wearing such cologne.

Platonic Forms, according to Plato, exist independent of humans, as disembodied truths. A Platonic sphere is perfect. The physical world provides no such sphere. It does not and cannot exist as a physical object. Any physical embodiment of a sphere will be made of some material composed of atoms and molecules. No matter how smoothly polished it is, the surface of the sphere will not match the Platonic concept, but rather will have dents and undulations and a fuzziness imposed by the quantum mechanical impossibility of pinning down the location or boundary of the electrons that make up the atoms. Where and what is the surface? Without a surface, we cannot talk about a surface area, but a Platonic sphere should have a surface that is exactly equal to 4 πr 2 , where r is the radius. But the notion of surface has no rigorous basis in physics at the atomic scale.

Figure 2.2

Aristotle is on the right, gesturing toward the earth, indicating that knowledge arises from the study of things, whereas Plato, on the left, gestures toward the heavens, indicating that knowledge is discovery of Forms that exist in an ideal, disembodied world, independent of humans.

So in what sense does the Platonic sphere exist independent of humans? It does not exist in the physical world. We can construct a mathematical model of a sphere, but this is still a human construction not a disembodied truth. For example, we can give a mathematical model of a sphere as follows. A sphere with radius r centered at coordinates (0, 0, 0) in a Cartesian coordinate system is the set of points ( x , y , z ) that satisfy

It is no accident that there is nothing sexy about such a Platonic model.

Figure 2.4

Aspirational self-portrait of the author.

The mathematical model of equation (2048) is a human construction, given in the language of algebra and the Cartesian three-dimensional model of space. It can be viewed as an imperfect (i.e., wrong) model of things in the physical world that resemble spheres. Those things in the physical world can be viewed as models of a mental concept of a sphere, as can the equation. But nowhere is there any direct evidence of a human-independent existence of the Platonic Ideal sphere. The mathematical model is not a Platonic Form, but rather at best a model of a Platonic Form, existing within a modeling paradigm (algebra and Cartesian space). There are many other ways to model a sphere mathematically, and as I will discuss in chapter 9 , every such way has limitations. So even an abstract model is a shadow on the wall. Even if it is just a shadow on the wall, it will be more faithful to a Platonic Form of a sphere than any physical model could be. It may be the best representation accessible to us of the Platonic Ideal.

A concrete model of a horse is shown in figure 2.3 being printed by a 3D printer. That printer accepts as input a file containing another kind of model of a horse. Specifically, the file uses a language called STL (for STereoLithography) that is widely used to specify three-dimensional shapes. The STL language was created in 1987 by 3D Systems, headquartered in Rock Hill, South Carolina, a company that makes and sells 3D printers.

A model of a horse in STL is an abstract model. It is based on a paradigm for modeling three-dimensional shapes in terms of two-dimensional facets that share edges. An example of an extremely simple STL model is shown in figure 2.5 . The STL text on the left specifies the pyramid shape at the upper right. It consists of four triangles that form the outer boundary of the object. The vertices of the four triangles are given in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

To fully understand the text in the figure, one needs to first assimilate the paradigm on which STL is based. If you will forgive a brief nerd storm, that paradigm is of three-dimensional tessellations of two-dimensional facets, together with rules such as the right-hand rule, which determines which side of a facet is inside versus outside the shape. If you had studied computer graphics, the previous sentence would be easy to read. Otherwise, probably not.

The STL file for the horse being printed in figure 2.3 is much more complicated than the pyramid, so I will not attempt to show it to you here. It is meant to be read by machines not by humans. The horse model is rendered from the STL file at the lower right in figure 2.5 , where if you look closely, you can see the two-dimensional facets that define the shape. Such a model of a horse is sometimes called a virtual prototype because it serves the same purpose as a physical prototype, but it does not have a physical form.

Models are expressed in some physical medium. The concrete model of a horse in figure 2.3 is a three-dimensional printed plastic prototype. The physical medium is plastic as assembled by a 3D printer. An abstract model of the same design might be a mathematical formula describing its shape, like equation (2048), or an STL file such as that in figure 2.5 . This abstract model can be sent to a 3D printer to produce the concrete model. Abstract models also have physical form in the sense that equation (2048) is ink on a page (or pixels on a screen) and an STL file is aligned magnetic iron molecules on a disk or electric charges in a computer memory, but their physical form is incidental. When an abstract model is converted from one physical form to another, for example, into your mental state when you read equation (2048), or when you copy an STL file from one computer to another, we do not end up with two models. It is still just one model, albeit in two or more physical representations. The ontology of an abstract model is independent of its physical embodiment.

Figure 2.5

Three-dimensional shape specified in STL.

Concrete models are exemplars in physical form of a class, whereas abstract models are abstractions of a class. The possibilities for expressive media are much richer for abstract models than for concrete models because they are less constrained by the physical world. STL, in fact, can specify shapes that cannot exist in the physical world, with overlapping facets or facets that do not share edges. Modeling languages are abstract not concrete. They yield more readily to human creativity. Moreover, they invite invention, and even paradigm shifts. A well-chosen modeling language enables elegant expression of complex designs.

Both concrete and abstract models can be used for analysis. A physical prototype of a component, for example, can be used to determine whether the part that it models will fit properly within its housing. But abstract models offer much richer possibilities for analysis. If the modeling medium, the language in which the models are expressed, has a rigorous semantics, then the model may be subject to automated analysis. A computer program can determine whether the component will fit within its housing without ever having to construct a physical prototype.

Figure 2.6 shows a prototype, a concrete model, of an incandescent lightbulb made with a carbonized bamboo filament. This prototype was made in Thomas Edison's lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey. According to The Edison Papers Project (2016), Edison initially tried to make lamps with platinum wire filaments because the metal has a high melting point. But he discovered that when heated in air, the metal would change its structure, weakening the filament, and the melting point would drop. He solved this problem by putting the filament in a vacuum bulb.

Edison was well known for a style of invention that I will call prototype and test . To find a material for the filament that would produce a reasonable amount of light with a reasonable voltage and lifespan, Edison tried many alternatives. Although his starting point, platinum, worked reasonably well in a vacuum, platinum is an expensive precious metal. Edison's platinum bulbs were likely to be too expensive to become commercial successes. Also from The Edison Papers Project (2016),

He turned to carbon and experimented with some cotton threads, different kinds of paper and cardboard, various woods, and then with a few long fiber plant materials before settling on bamboo. Later he had a worldwide search conducted to see if he could find a better long fiber plant as he did not hold the key patents on artificial fibers, which were beginning to prove better.

This is an Aristotelian approach to solving a problem: experiment with materials and infer their properties from observation. The problem he was trying to solve was how to use electricity to generate light. As a side effect of this engineering work, he did some science, discovering a property of the natural world. Specifically, he found that a naturally occurring metal, platinum, when heated in air, changes its structure.

Bamboo filament lightbulbs went into production in 1882 and about six years later were supplanted with tungsten filament bulbs. Both of these styles require operating in a vacuum, otherwise the filament will burn, melt, or otherwise quickly degrade. Edison's discovery that heated metals degrade in air and do not degrade in a vacuum, a scientific fact, became central to the development of a practical lightbulb, an engineering invention.

Thomas Edison used an abstract model of what happens in an incandescent lightbulb, in addition to the physical prototypes. Specifically, he used Ohm's law, first published by Georg Simon Ohm in 1827. Ohm's law relates the current i through a resistor to the voltage v across the resistor by

where the proportionality constant R is called the resistance . The resistance, which has units of ohms in honor of Georg Ohm, is a property of the material used to make the resistor and the geometry of the resistor. A lightbulb filament is a resistor, and in Edison's day, the resistance of a filament would have been determined empirically.

Because of its resistance, the filament heats up, and it is because of the heat that the filament generates light. Platinum conducts electricity easily, which means that its resistance is low. Carbon-based materials, such as bamboo fibers, have much higher resistance. At a fixed voltage v , therefore, the current that flows through a platinum filament will be much higher than the current that flows through a bamboo filament. The low resistance of platinum is therefore another disadvantage, along with its high cost. To accommodate the higher currents that result from low resistance, Edison would have had to use thicker copper wires to deliver electricity to the lightbulbs, driving up system cost.

Ohm's law is an abstract model. Unlike the model in figure 2.6 , there is nothing physical about this model. It nevertheless represents the「essence of things」and yet, in a true Aristotelian manner, was likely derived by Ohm from observation and measurement rather than from fundamental truths.

Ohm's law can be viewed as a law of nature, in which case it must be true of any electrical circuit. Alternatively, we can view Ohm's law as the definition of「resistance」and「resistor.」Under the latter interpretation, any device is a resistor if the current that flows through it is proportional to the voltage across it (i.e., if its behavior conforms with the model given in equation [1024]).

The distinction between these two interpretations is subtle but important. First, note that there is an implicit assumption in equation (1024) that we are talking about the current i and voltage v at an instant in time. In almost all electrical circuits, the current and voltage vary with time. For a lightbulb, the current and voltage are both zero when the light switch is turned off and are nonzero when the switch is on, so clearly there is a dependence on time.

A key question now becomes whether the resistance R should also vary with time. It turns out that neither platinum nor bamboo will satisfy equation (1024) with a constant value of resistance. In fact, the resistance varies with the temperature of the material, and the temperature depends on the current. If the filament starts out cold, then as current flows through it, the material will heat up and its resistance will increase. If the filament heats up too much, then the material melts and resistance becomes infinite (no current flows). Hence, the current depends not only on the voltage now, at an instant in time, but also on the history of the voltage and current at earlier times. How long the lightbulb has been on will affect its temperature and hence the current.

So it won't work to fix the resistance R to be constant. We have to let it vary with time. But then we have a conundrum. If R is an empirically determined value, then Ohm's law becomes a tautology! It is trivially true of every electrical circuit. At any instant in time, the resistance is

which is just a rearrangement of equation (1024). Every electrical circuit with nonzero voltage and current trivially satisfies Ohm's law by simply using R as defined in equation (512) as the definition of the resistance. This defines the resistance at time t to be whatever value makes Ohm's law true! Surely Georg Ohm did not get a basic electrical unit named after him for discovering a tautology. So this cannot be the right interpretation.

One resolution of this conundrum is that the notion of a resistor is a Platonic Ideal Form. A resistor is a device that at all times satisfies equations (1024) and (512) with a constant resistance R . But there is no such device in the physical world. At a minimum, every known material has a resistance that depends on temperature. Moreover, most every known material heats up as current flows through it. 1

Besides temperature, other physical effects, specifically inductance and capacitance , ensure that physical materials do not exactly obey Ohm's law with a constant R . These effects introduce memory and dynamics in the system. For example, inductance is the tendency for current that is flowing to keep flowing, even if the voltage drops to zero. A material with nonzero inductance will take some time to adjust the current to a new voltage. During that time, it will not satisfy Ohm's law with the same fixed constant R . All materials, in practice, have some nonzero inductance, even if small. 2

In fact, no physical object is a resistor. Because no physical object obeys Ohm's law, how can we take this to be a law of nature? Plato's allegory of the cave states that human perception is limited to shadows of reality, but it appears that physical objects are but shadows of the Platonic Ideal Form of a resistor. This Platonic Form is not only inaccessible to humans, it is also inaccessible to nature!

As a consequence, Ohm's law is either trivial or wrong. I see no choice but to conclude that Ohm's law is a human-constructed model, not a fundamental truth about nature. It did not exist as a fundamental truth before Georg Ohm because no physical object in the world obeys it. To the extent that it is a fundamental truth, it is so because we declare it to be so. We define a「resistor」to be a physical object whose behavior is reasonably closely modeled by Ohm's equation, and we define the resistance to be the ratio of voltage across that object to current through that object. An ideal resistor, which does not exist in nature, does not in fact exist at all except in the human mind. Ohm's law was invented, not discovered.

2.3 Models Are Wrong

Modeling is central to every scientific and engineering enterprise. Solomon Wolf Golomb (1932–2016), who has written eloquently about the use of models in science and engineering, emphasizes understanding the distinction between a model and thing being modeled. He famously stated,「You will never strike oil by drilling through the map」(Golomb, 1971). A map is a model. The territory is the thing being modeled. You should drill through the territory, not the map.

For both scientists and engineers, the「thing being modeled」is typically an object, process, or system in the physical world. 3 Let us call the thing being modeled the target of the model. The fidelity of a model is the degree to which it emulates the target.

When the target is a physical object, process, or system, the model fidelity is never perfect. Box and Draper (1987) state,「essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.」The model in figure 2.4 is not useful (at least not to me). Ohm's law, in contrast, is quite useful. It models certain physical devices, such as Edison's lightbulb filaments. Although it models them imperfectly, Edison used this model to understand that a bamboo filament was a better choice than a platinum filament in a lightbulb.

A useful model has to have a purpose, and the fidelity of the model needs to be evaluated against that purpose. Ohm's law, as a model for a lightbulb, will tell Edison how much current will flow through the filament, but it will not tell him how much light will be generated. A different model is needed for that purpose.

Note that a model may be「useful」in ways that are not practical or mercenary. Merriam-Webster defines「useful」as「helping to do or achieve something.」That「something」may be further intellectual inquiry or pure science. That is, a model may be useful because it explains or predicts a phenomenon even if there is no practical application for that phenomenon. Einstein's model of gravitational waves is useful because, among other things, it suggests a way to observe the collision of black holes, as done by LIGO, even if we have no practical use for colliding black holes.

When using models, it is important to apply them only within their regime of applicability, which is limited for all models. Ohm's law, by itself, will not be applicable to a resistor that has melted. Gravitational waves are not useful when studying the interactions of subatomic particles. 4

Models are generally more useful when their fidelity is higher. So how do we get good model fidelity? We have two different mechanisms available to us. We can either choose (or invent) a model that is faithful to the target, or we can choose (or invent) a target that is faithful to the model. The former is the essence of what a scientist does. The latter is the essence of what an engineer does. Both require assuming that the target is operating within some regime of applicability of the model.

Edison was a quintessential engineer of his time. In selecting a lightbulb filament (a target), among other properties (durability, tolerance for high temperature), Edison needed a filament that was well modeled by Ohm's law. Suppose that Edison had chosen instead a filament that was well modeled by a different law known as Faraday's law of induction. This choice would have resulted in a poor lightbulb. If you will indulge me a brief nerd storm, I will attempt to explain why.

As I pointed out before, inductance is the tendency for current that is flowing to keep flowing, even if the voltage drops to zero. An inductor is a device that resists changes in current, as opposed to a resistor, which simply resists current. By analogy, a resistor is like a lazy person and an inductor is like a stubborn person. It takes more effort to get a lazy person to work for you and to keep him working, whereas once a stubborn person is working at something, that person will keep working at it (like me with this book). A person may be both lazy and stubborn, just as a physical device may have both resistance and inductance.

In one of the simpler forms of Faraday's law, the current i and voltage v of an inductor are related by 5

where the constant L is called the inductance . 6 This equation states that the voltage v ( t ) at time t is proportional to the rate of change of current i at time t , where the proportionality constant is L . This means that if the current changes rapidly, the voltage is high. Vice versa, if the voltage is high, the current changes rapidly.

According to Wikipedia,

Electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832. Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments. (Retrieved March 15, 2016)

We might be tempted to change「discovered」to「invented」on the Wikipedia page, but that would not be quite right. The word「discovered」is correct for induction but not for equation (256). Equation (256) is an invention. It is an idealized model, and just like Ohm's law, no physical object perfectly obeys it (with constant L ). As a model, therefore, it is wrong, but it is extremely useful.

Kuhn (1962) takes a stand on the relationship between discovery and invention, stating,「Discovery and invention are inseparable because the theory to explain the discovery must occur for the discovery to occur.」The discovery that a current that is flowing tends to keep flowing (inductance) and that this property is accentuated in certain devices (inductors) is inextricably linked to the model represented in equation (256), in the sense that some form of this model has to be understood to recognize the discovery. This link between discovery and invention, Kuhn says, also makes it much more difficult to pinpoint a discovery, assigning it to a particular person at a particular time:

· · · the sentence,「Oxygen was discovered,」misleads by suggesting that discovering something is a single simple act assimilable to our usual (and also questionable) concept of seeing. That is why we so readily assume that discovering, like seeing or touching, should be unequivocally attributable to an individual and to a moment in time. But the latter attribution is always impossible, and the former often is as well. (Kuhn, 1962, p. 55)

Discoveries never occur at an instant in time and are rarely properly attributable to an individual. The messiness with the discovery of the transistor effect, leading to a Nobel Prize, years after the transistor had been patented as an invention, underscores this point.

Let me illustrate how Edison might have used the model of inductance in equation (256). Suppose that he had chosen as a lightbulb filament an inductor like those in figure 2.8 . The first problem he would have run into is that these filaments would not have generated any light. But this would only be the start of his problems. Suppose for simplicity that L = 1 henry. 7 Suppose that we now apply a constant voltage of one volt to the lightbulb. By equation (256), the rate of change of current becomes

This has units of amps per second. It means that for every second that passes, the current increases by one amp. If the current is initially zero when we turn on the lightbulb, then after 10 seconds, the current will be 10 amps. After one minute, the current will be 60 amps. After one hour, the current will be 3,600 amps. After a few days, the house will have burned down, the transformer on the power pole outside the house will have blown up, and the electric bill will have become more than the cost of a college education. Edison would not have been able to sell us more than one such lightbulb. 8

I have already concluded that both Ohm's law and Faraday's law are wrong, in the sense that no physical object obeys either law exactly. But a bamboo fiber in a vacuum bulb comes pretty close to obeying Ohm's law, and a coil of copper around an iron core, as on the left in figure 2.8 , comes pretty close to obeying Faraday's law. However, in both cases, the model is wrong.

Edison was an engineer, but he also made contributions to science, and he relied heavily on experimentation, as many scientists do. To a scientist, the value of a model lies in how well its properties match those of a target, typically an object found in nature. The value of Ohm's and Faraday's laws lies in how well they describe the properties of some object under study. But to an engineer such as Edison, the value of an object, say a bamboo fiber, lies in how well its properties match a model, in this case, Ohm's law. Edison understood enough about electricity to know that an inductive filament would be of no use. Instead, he knew that he needed a filament for which Ohm's law was a faithful model (and that also generated light), and he went about the task of finding a filament (a target) for that model.

According to Popper's philosophy of science, a scientific model, a「theory,」must be falsifiable to be scientific. Under this principle, Ohm's and Faraday's laws are either unscientific or false. If the laws are tautologies, then they are not falsifiable, and if not, then no physical object obeys them, so they are false. Ohm's and Faraday's laws are useful not true .

In what Simon might have called the「sciences of the natural,」to distinguish them from the「sciences of the artificial,」a scientist is, by definition, given the target. It exists in nature. Such a scientist constructs models to help understand the target. An engineer, in contrast, constructs targets to emulate the properties of a model. An engineer uses or invents models for things that do not exist and then tries to construct physical objects (targets) for which the models are reasonably faithful. For an engineer, a model provides a design and the target is the implementation . The task is to find an implementation that is faithful to the model.

These two uses of models are complementary. Engineers and scientists will typically use models both ways. Edison spent a great deal of effort characterizing the electrical properties of all sorts of natural materials before settling on bamboo fibers. Good engineering requires doing good science. And at least for experimental science, good science requires doing good engineering, as we saw in the last chapter with the LIGO gravitational wave detector.

In both cases, the models are wrong. In engineering, a model is useful if we can find an implementation that is reasonably faithful to the model. In science, a model is useful if it is reasonably faithful to a target given to us by nature. A scientist asks,「Can I make a model for this thing?」An engineer asks,「Can I make a thing for this model?」

Models are human constructions. Modeling paradigms are also human constructions. Therefore, both are subject to creativity. They are invented not discovered. Because an engineer constructs models for things that do not yet exist, there is much more room for creativity than for a scientist, at least one focusing on the sciences of the natural, who is stuck crafting models for things that already exist. Moreover, I claim that digital technology has smashed open the possibilities for what could exist, so the room for creativity is vast indeed. I examine how digital technology does this in the next chapter.

1 An exception occurs when some materials, called superconductors , are cooled below a critical threshold where they enter a superconductive state, where the resistance becomes exactly zero. But the temperatures required are extremely cold. In 1987, Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller got the Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering a「high temperature superconductor.」Their ceramic compound exhibited superconductivity at the「high」temperature of −243.15 degrees Celsius or −405.67 degrees Fahrenheit. As of this writing, the highest temperature at which superconductivity has been observed is about −70° C (−94° F ), still extremely cold, and even then only at extremely high pressures. No practical lightbulb could be expected to work only at such temperatures and pressures.

2 An imperfect analogy might help the reader if the reader has not studied electricity. An electric current can be visualized as water flowing down a sluice or channel that is tilted. The degree of tilt is analogous to the voltage. The rate of water flow is analogous to the current. A smaller channel will have a higher resistance than a larger channel (the smaller channel lets through less water for a given tilt). Inductance is analogous to the tendency of water that is flowing to keep flowing (it has inertia). If water is flowing down a tilted sluice and you suddenly flatten the sluice, removing the tilt, the water will not instantly stop flowing. This analogy is imperfect for several reasons. Electric current does not have inertia, or at least not much, and inductance is a property of the channel not the current. But it nevertheless provides a nice visual analogy that can be used to get the basic idea.

3 The「thing being modeled」can also be another model. I will examine that issue later in chapter 3 .

4 Penrose (1989) speculates that gravitational waves may in fact be implicated in certain subatomic quantum mechanical phenomena, but as of this writing, there is no experimental corroboration for this thesis and no wide support among physicists.

5 Messerschmitt's law (see footnote on page 2) probably becomes overly conservative when the equation uses calculus, as this one does. I suspect that this equation will drop my readership by more than half, but I will nevertheless stick to the numbering scheme previously established.

6 The units of the inductance L are called「henries」after Joseph Henry. It is customary to use the symbol L for inductance.

7 One henry is actually a very large inductance, but it makes the math simpler and therefore will damage my readership less than a more reasonable choice of, say, one millihenry.

8 Most household circuits in the United States have fuses that trip, interrupting the current, when the current exceeds 15 or 20 amps, so this scenario would not play out this way in your house. Also, the voltage supplied in a household circuit is much larger, typically 170 volts at its peak in the United States (see Lee and Varaiya [2011] sidebar on page 11 for an explanation of household electric power). Hence, during the time that the voltage is 170 volts, the current will increase at a rate of 170 amps per second, which means it will reach 15 amps in 11 milliseconds. At this point, it will trip the fuse, leaving you in the dark. So the bulb would operate for only 11 milliseconds.
