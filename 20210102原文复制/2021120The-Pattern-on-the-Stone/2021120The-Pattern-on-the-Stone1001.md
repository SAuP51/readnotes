This project was originally suggested to me by John Brockman, who felt that there was a need for a short book summarizing the ideas behind computers. It seemed to me like a straightforward project at the time, but I soon discovered that writing a short book on such a broad subject can be more difficult than writing a long one.

I thank John and also William Frucht of Basic Books for their help in this endeavor. I wrote the book while visiting at the MIT Media Laboratory, and I would like to thank all of the faculty and students who helped and supported me there, especially the laboratory's founder and director, Nicholas Negroponte. I received significant help in the preparation of the initial manuscript from Debbie Widener, and also from Bettylou McClanahan and Peggi Oakley. Most of what is in the book was taught to me by my friend and mentor Marvin Minsky and other inspiring teachers at MIT, including Gerald Sussman, Claude Shannon, Seymour Papert, Tomaso Poggio, Patrick Winston, and Tom Knight.

I would also like to thank those who read through early drafts and gave me helpful comments: Jerry Lyons, Seymour Papert, George Dyson, Chris Sykes, Brian Eno, Po Bronson, Argye Hillis, and Pati Hillis. I received helpful advice on specific chapters from Tommy Poggio, Neil Gershenfeld, Simon Garfinkel, Mitchell Resnick, and Marvin Minsky. I was very fortunate to have the help of Sara Lippincott, who edited the text, much improving it in the process. Finally, I would like to thank my family: my parents Argye and Bill, who encouraged my interests in designing complex machines; my children, Noah, Asa, and India; and especially my wife, Pati, who patiently encouraged and supported me throughout the project.
