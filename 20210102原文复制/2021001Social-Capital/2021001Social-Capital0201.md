# 0108. Social Capital and the Emergence of Social Structure

This chapter1 focuses on the problem of how rational actions lead to social structure. So far in this monograph, the social capital theory has been developed and research undertaken to understand the meaningful-ness of actions within the context of social structure. That is, the theory has addressed the issue of actions while acknowledging and recognizing the a priori existence and effect of social structure. What I propose to explore in this chapter is the plausibility that actions may lead to social structure. That is, I seek to develop some theoretical arguments to answer the question of whether rationality based on resource maintenance or defense, as well as resource expansion and gain, allows us to better understand the rules of interaction and the formation of primary social groups (e.g., the primordial group). And further, whether consideration of social capital’s relative utility to personal capital offers the theoretical plausibility that rational actions may indeed lead to the emergence of social structure beyond the primordial group.

This chapter sketches a theory proposing how actions may lead to the emergence of social structure. I choose to theorize this process because it should theoretically (logically) precede processes dealing with interdependence and mutual causation between structure and action. Once the issue of action leading to the emergence of structure is explicated, interdependence and interaction between the two should follow (action affects structure and structure affects action). By focusing on the issue of an emerging social structure, I hope to shed light on other critical issues involved in action theory: what rationality is, what principles guide action and interaction, and why social structures (group and collectivity) are not only possible but inevitable from such action and interaction principles.

1 A significant portion of this chapter was adapted and revised from Lin (1994a) with permission.

My basic arguments are three. First, rational action is seen as having multidimensional motives regarding valued resources. At least two are considered fundamental: minimization of loss and maximization of gain.

These are independent, though empirically correlated, calculations, with the former claiming priority over the latter (see Chapter 4). Second, these calculations, and the problem of succession, lead to rules of resource transfers and the primacy of the primordial group. Interactions and collective action in the primordial group are guided primarily by the sentiment to retain and defend resources and secondarily by the need to gain resources. Third, in general, the utility of social capital (resources embedded in social ties) substantially exceeds that of personal or human capital.

This calculation, in the face of the scarcity of valued resources, propels the extension of interactions beyond one’s primordial group. Once such ties and exchanges are formed, certain collective rules follow. These rules, beyond interacting actors’ original intents and interests, constitute the basis for social structure formation.

This chapter will follow some fundamental propositions concerning action and interaction in the proposed social capital theory (Chapter 5) to describe the primordial group’s formation and significance. It will then specify the relative utilities of human and social capital, and argue that social capital’s relative utility constitutes a motive for interaction and exchange with actors outside the primordial group. The chapter concludes with some further discussion on the nature of the emerging social structure. These explorations are speculative in nature and will be inevitably brief here. The purpose, nevertheless, is to present the key arguments and outline a set of propositions so that further elaboration and evaluation are possible.

Before we begin, it is useful to locate this problem in the context of theorization about social structure and action.

Sociological Theorizing

One way to categorize theorization in sociology is to capture how a theory specifies its causing and consequent concepts relative to two levels of society: structure and actors. If these two levels constitute a dichotomy, a simple typology may look like the one presented in Table 8.1. This typology identifies four types of theory. A macrotheory specifies both cause and effect concepts at the structural level, while a microtheory posits a relationship between them at the actor level. A structural theory links causal structural concepts to effectual actor-level concepts, and an action theory hypothesizes structural effects of actor-level concepts.

This is a simplification, because it is possible to specify a more complex theory that involves cause or effect concepts at both structural and actor levels or concepts implicating more than two levels (e.g., individual actors, organizations, and society; see Hannan 1992). For example, a theory concerning an actor’s psychological well-being (an actor-level effect concept) may be specified as a consequence of both her or his network support (a structural-level concept) and her or her self-esteem (an actor-level concept) (see, e.g., Lin, Dean, and Ensel 1986). Likewise, a theory may concern the income level as a consequence of the education level (an actor-level concept), the nature of the firm (an organization-level concept), and the industrial sector (an economy or society-level concept) (see, e.g., Kalleberg and Lincoln 1988).

Given these precautions, the typology in Table 8.1 informs us of the fundamental theoretical process within which a particular theory positions itself. My sense is that of the four types, action theory is the most challenging and controversial. It is challenging because its causal concepts clearly intersect those primarily and usually identified as under the domains of other scientific disciplines: economics, psychology, or cultural anthropology. Rational choice theory, for example, extensively borrows the economic assumptions concerning optimization or maximization of choices relative to self-interest (Coleman 1990). Psychological and personality characteristics lay claim to concepts such as well-being , distress , and attitudes (see the discussion of shame in Elias 1939/1978 and that of emotion in Scheff 1992). Norms, values, and traditions can hardly be dissociated from collective and socialization experiences (Marini 1992).

An action theory does not wish to disown these potential sources of action (or spring of action , as Coleman 1990 calls it). It merely considers them as factors exogenous to the theory. The theory nevertheless needs to demonstrate that it involves more than a simple derivation from concepts already claimed theoretically by other disciplines.

Action theory is also controversial because its principal proposition concerning the causal linkage from action (the actor-level concept) to

130

Conceptual Extensions

structure seems to suggest that the whole can be explained by its interacting parts. In general, trans-level causation is harder to demonstrate theoretically than same-level causation. Structural theory, however, has at least the advantage of the omnipresence of structure over actors. Thus, when it is claimed that an actor’s job-seeking behavior is dictated by the tightness of the labor market, it is hardly possible to place such actions outside the context of the labor market.2 Action theory, on the other hand, does not have this advantage because it is generally assumed that the structure is more than the sum of actions and interactions of actions (see the argument of structural or organizational robustness in Hannan 1992). Further, once a structure is in place, it becomes theoretically difficult to rule out the continuous interaction between structure and action.

An action theory faces the constant challenge to demonstrate whether and how effects of action remain when or after structural effects are taken into account. Abell (1992, p. 186) correctly points out that the primary puzzle for a rational choice theory is to demonstrate how

「interdependent individual actions produce system (or collective) level outcomes.」

Principles of Action: Minimization of Loss and Maximization of Gain

The theory begins with two simple assumptions about motives for action: actions are primarily driven or motivated by the innate need for survival, and survival is seen as dependent upon the accumulation of valued resources. These assumptions regarding the motives (springs) for action require no further elaboration. What needs to be explored are the principles for action – choices and priority among choices. Again, for simplicity, I assume that action is driven by the desire to defend (maintain) resources or to seek (expand) resources.3 Action driven by resource defense is a calculation for minimizing resource loss (relative loss to cost).

Action driven by resource expansion, on the other hand, is a calculation for maximizing resource gain (relative gain to cost). Based on leads from previous sociological theories (the homophily principles and predomi-nance of expressive needs) and research evidence (see Marini 1992 for a review of evidence supporting the claim that in routine behavior, defending against loss may be a greater concern than seeking gain) regarding the relative significance of assessing losses and gains, I now propose that defending resources has higher priority than expanding resources.4

2 This is not to argue for or claim the proposition’s validity.

3 This assumption is consistent with the purposive action approach.

4 This is valid only if the actor has some resources to begin with.

Social Capital and Social Structure 131

Proposition 1: Defense and maintenance of resources is the ultimate motive for action. Thus, the first principle of action is a calculation of minimizing (resource) loss.

Proposition 2: Gaining and expanding resources is the next primary motive for action. Thus, the second principle of action is a calculation of maximizing (resource) gain.

These propositions present two important arguments. First, minimization of loss and maximization of gain are two different functions rather than inverse functions of each other.5 They may involve different choices (what kind and how much of a resource) and therefore different preferences. Second, they form a ranked action set rather than a dichotomy. A series of actions may manifest two motives: minimizing loss and maximizing gain. Given the opportunity, actions are taken to fulfill both motives. However, when the actor must make a choice, preference is given to maintaining resources: the higher priority is given to the calculation that minimizes loss.

Recognition and Profit: Principles of Interaction How would these two action principles implicate interactions? They would, first of all, suggest that interactions are engaged primarily for minimizing resource loss and secondarily for maximizing gain. An interaction following the principle of loss minimization strives to defend loss of resources to another actor. The best possible outcome is that there is no loss. If both actors employ the minimization principle, one local equilibrium is that both actors accept the no-loss outcome for both actors.

In social terminology, this outcome is a mutual recognition of each other’s claim to their respective resources – property rights.6 Recognition therefore is a cost to each actor in that ego abandons any challenge to the alter’s sovereignty over its resources.7 It is a minimal cost.

This is a local equilibrium, because it is very constrained. First, it assumes that only two actors engage in the interaction. When multiple actors (three or more) are engaged, a coalition is likely to result and the local equilibrium becomes increasingly difficult to maintain. Second, it is seldom the case that the two actors bring equal resources to bear in the interaction. Thus, recognition itself becomes a variable rather than 5 Empirically, they may be negatively correlated.

6 Trust may be an alternative term. However, I believe recognition may be evoked without trust, which has a stronger affective meaning. See Chapter 9 for further discussion of recognition.

7 Note that this would be considered a mere stalemate or a worst outcome if the principle of maximization is evoked.

132

a constant. That is, recognition may occur with unequal costs to the two parties. One actor may be willing to give more recognition to the alter in that ego not only disclaims the alter’s sovereignty over resources, but also commits itself to come to the defense of the alter, should its sovereignty be challenged in interactions with other actors. Or recognition may be maintained only after an actor has also agreed to give up some resources to the alter. Thus, at a minimum, there are two types of recognition. In the first instance, where mutual recognition is achieved with minimal cost to each actor (Pizzorno 1991), we may consider the recognition as approval or social approval (Lindenberg 1992). In the second instance, recognition implicates legitimation – certain generally accepted rules for responsive actions to ensure recognition. Third, seldom do actors use the pure minimization principle in a series of actions. Recognition may be a temporary outcome – until one or more actors proceed to evoke the principle of maximization of gain.

Thus, in realistic situations, recognition usually comes as an outcome with unequal costs to parties, an issue I will address in more detail in the next chapter. Nevertheless, I argue that it is the fundamental principle for interactions, for it guarantees the minimal survival of an actor and is consistent with the first principle of action (Proposition 1).

Proposition 3: Interaction, following the minimization principle of action, seeks recognition of one’s claim to resources.

The element of recognition, I argue, is consistent with some concepts acknowledged or developed by several rational choice theorists (Pizzorno 1991; Lindenberg 1992). What is made explicit here is that recognition in interactions can be understood when action is motivated by the principle of minimization of loss rather than maximization of gain.

I will skip further discussion of interactions based on the principle of maximization of gain, for they would merely reflect the usual economic calculations as developed extensively in the literature. What needs to be studied at this point is how these principles of action and interaction offer clues to the emergence of social structure.

Succession and Transfer of Resources: The Primacy of the Primordial Group

Human actions are further compounded by additional innate but prominent life circumstances: finality of life and reproductivity of life. Survival of an individual actor is limited in time. One possible consequence of an actor’s exit might be that all resources associated with the actor revert back to a pool for other actors to compete for. However, this strategy

Social Capital and Social Structure 133

would mean a total loss of resources to the actor after lifelong efforts (actions and interactions) to maintain and expand them.

Alternatively, the resources may be transferred to another actor(s). An extension of the primacy of the principle of minimization of loss (Proposition 1) suggests that the actor prefers to transfer claimed resources to another actor deemed most suitable as a surrogate. Suitability is reflected in the extent to which the surrogate is easily identified with the actor in continued recognition and legitimation relative to other actors. Reproductivity of life, in most societies, offers an easy rule to identify the surrogate. Thus, for most societies, the primordial group, the family, becomes the immediate and natural extension of the actor.8

The primacy of the primordial group for succession and transfer of resources further incorporates noneconomic considerations into actions.

Restriction of succession within a primordial group reduces the range of the surrogate’s choices. Depending on the rules of succession, the choice may be reduced to zero degree (e.g., the oldest son as the successor).

Thus, recognition and legitimation considerations are given increasing priority over competence and skills that are useful in maximizing gains

– the economic calculation. It is clear that the existence of the primordial group, as it prevails throughout human history, makes any theory based on economic calculations alone unattainable.

This last conclusion does not lead to another conclusion: that actions are not rational. If rationality is defined as the process of reasoning by way of calculation over choices, then it is clear, as argued earlier, that recognition and profit provide rational bases for interaction choices.

Human Capital, Social Capital, and Social Network The need to minimize loss and maximize gain establishes two building blocks to understand interactions beyond the primordial group. However, we need to introduce another building block: consideration of 8 Elsewhere (Lin 1989), I discuss rules of transfer and types of resources transferred. There are variations in transfer rules within the context of family. For example, inheritance rules vary across societies, and there is no uniformity regarding unigeniture, primogeniture, or even-distribution principles, even though there seems to be a strong tendency toward male primacy. In the most interesting case, the Chinese traditional system uses split rules: primogeniture for authority inheritance but even distribution among sons for property inheritance. The resulting conflict and chaos, as well as the diminishing pooled resources, cannot be explained by any economic principles. Nor is the family group (pre-dominantly the primordial group in most systems) the only primordial group. A primordial group can be and has been constructed on other bases (e.g., ethnic, religious, and gender identities). These variations, however, do not affect subsequent arguments in the chapter.

the relative utility of two kinds of resources, human capital and social capital.

Human capital is resources in the possession of the actor who can make decisions (exercise authority) about their usage and disposition.

These possessed goods can also be transferred to designated successors as the actor sees fit. Social capital is resources attached to other actors.

Interactions and relations with other actors offer the possibility that such resources can be borrowed for ego’s purposes. In return, the borrowed resources must be returned, replaced, or reciprocated. In the most primitive terms, borrowing a neighbor’s cutting instruments during a harvest is one example of access to and use of social capital. Once the harvest is over, the instruments are returned (either intact or replaced) to the neighbor. More important, the expectation is that the neighbor may borrow ego’s resources, such as his son, to help him harvest as well.

Because of the constraints attached to the use of social capital, as well as the energy and resources required to maintain relations and reciprocal transactions, sentiment dictates a preference for the accumulation of personal capital rather than social capital. That is, the relative cost (tem-porality in use, obligation for return or replacement, and commitment for reciprocity) for using human capital is much lower than that for using social capital. How do we account, then, for the use of social capital and therefore the maintenance of social relations? That, of course, is the critical and pivotal issue in any theory linking actions to structure.

The pinnacle argument, for me, rests with two central theoretical propositions:

Proposition 4: The accumulation of social capital is much faster than that of human capital . That is, accumulation of human capital tends to be additive in nature, whereas accumulation of social capital tends to be exponential .

Proposition 5: When interactions outside of one’s primordial group are intended to gain resources, they are used more for accessing social capital than gaining human capital .

Human capital is accumulated by actions taken by the actor and members of his or her primordial group. Each action generates a given amount of additional resources. Therefore, there is a tendency to expand the primordial group (e.g., the extended family) so that the generation and accumulation of resources can accelerate.

Social capital, on the other hand, is generated by creating and maintaining social ties. A relation with a social tie suggests a linkage and therefore access to the tie’s resources: social capital for ego. Further, once a tie is accessed, not only do his or her resources become social capital to ego, but the alter’s social ties also offer possible social capital. Con-

Social Capital and Social Structure

Figure 8.1 Accumulation rates for human and social capital.

ceivably, social capital might be accessible through ego’s network of direct and indirect ties. The extent of access to such social capital, of course, depends on how much resources are at the disposal of the social ties, as well as on the nature and extent of the ties. As these ties extend into a network of both direct and indirect ties, the pool of social capital grows exponentially. Thus, by using the networking principle, the potential pool of social capital becomes extended quickly. The hypothesized rates are depicted in Figure 8.1.

Further considerations need to be taken into account in developing possible models of exponential accumulation of social capital. The free rendition in Figure 8.1 is entirely conjectural. The slope of the S-shaped curve is based on the assumption that interactions and networking extend slowly at first, probably among a small number of actors with similar resources, and then quickly, to larger numbers of actors with dissimilar and better resources as the network extends through indirect ties.

It plateaus and reaches an upper limit, because the function must be constrained by an efficiency factor (it may be a function of the number of intermediary links, associated negatively with recognition and legitimation and positively with the cost or multiplicity of reciprocal obligations).

While the relative cost of accumulating and using social capital is high, there are conditions in which such cost is more than compensated for and exceeded by the relative advantage in the speed of accumulating social capital. The calculation tipping in favor of social capital approaches inevitability for most actors due to the likelihood of two limiting conditions for the accumulation of human capital: the ultimate limiting size of the primordial group and the scarcity of materials for resources.

136

Conceptual Extensions

As mentioned earlier, one way to speed up the accumulation of human capital is to expand the primordial group, whose membership shares the interest in resource production and transfers. However, as the size of the primordial group increases, it also creates problems for the maintenance of centralized authority over resources and competition for the succession to resource entitlement. To maintain the primordial group’s expansion, more and more resources must be generated so that there is sufficient sharing among members. So long as there are plenty of raw materials for resource production, the primordial group’s expansion can continue.

However, it is inevitable that multiple groups seeking resources increase in size to the point where they have to compete for materials.

Competition for scarce materials can be and is ended at a primitive level by one group taking physical possession of other primordial groups and turning the members of these groups into resource-generating instruments – enslaved laborers. However, unless the ability to take possession of another group is overwhelming in terms of relative size or superiority of instruments (technology), there is always a risk that the confrontation will result in the enslavement of ego’s group instead.

An alternative to enslavement in the face of material scarcity is access to and use of social capital, even though such use, as discussed, incurs a greater cost than the use of human capital. Once such a rational decision is made, interactions with actors beyond one’s primordial group not only take place, they are actively sought for their access to social capital.

Such access is also entirely consistent with the motives for actions (minimizing loss and maximizing gain) and the principles of interactions (recognition and profit). Social capital can be mobilized to accomplish both purposes.

The Emergence of Structure

Such access comes at an important cost – willingness and preparedness to reciprocate in terms of recognition and profit. There must be a commitment to provide one’s own resources as social capital to others. To ensure stable access to social capital and to demonstrate reciprocity, interactions are routinized – that is, social relations are formed. The maintenance of social relations is likewise based on the two rational principles specified in Propositions 1 and 2. Social capital is used primarily and is relied on to maintain, sustain, and defend one’s resources. It is used secondarily to gain additional resources. Legitimation guides reciprocity and the calculation process. The calculation is complicated by the fact that routinized social relations directly and indirectly involve

Social Capital and Social Structure 137

multiple actors and their primordial (and extended) groups. While such relations promote access to social capital, recognition and legitimation of relations and obligations quickly increase the complexity of calculations. That is, sharing social capital and an increasing need for legitimation rules go hand in hand. In subsequent actions, an actor’s calculation must take into account whether the action is consistent with the obligation to defend and/or expand the resources of the interacting actors.

The multiplicity and complexity of routinized social relations demand increasing rules of recognition and legitimation. These rules recognize the basic right to human capital (property) and, at the same time, specify responsibilities and obligations for actors in the interacting network to contribute resources. Recognition, in fact, is an important way to overcome a possible cost of unequal exchanges – why someone in a higher social position and with richer resources would be engaged in repeated exchanges with someone in a lower social position and with poorer resources. I will elaborate on this function further in the next chapter.

Collectivity and Public Capital

Once such social relations and sharing of resources are established and maintained, a collectivity is formed. A collectivity is an aggregation of actors and primordial groups bound together for the sharing of social capital. A collectivity can also decide to produce further resources that belong to the collectivity rather than to specific actors – the public capital . The persistence of a collectivity depends on a set of formal and informal rules governing actors relative to each other and to the access and use of shared resources. These rules establish differential obligations and rewards for member actors.

Differential obligations are necessary because the collectivity’s continued existence depends on the maintenance and gain of shared resources.

Obligations include two types: (1) recognition and loyalty (sentiment) to the collectivity and its rules and (2) amount and type of performance (work) in the production of shared resources, especially public capital.

The loyalty factor minimizes the loss of public capital, and the performance requirement maximizes the gain of such resources. Differential rewards are necessary because actors are evaluated as differentially fulfilling their obligations to the collectivity. Thus, more rewards are given to those who demonstrate a high degree of loyalty and/or a high level of performance. Rewards can be symbolic as well as material. Material rewards include the designation and allocation of resources to the actor-occupants (the gaining of human capital) and the authority to access and

138

Conceptual Extensions

use shared resources (public capital). Symbolic rewards include public commendation of the actor-occupant and assurance of the transfer of such honors to the actor’s future generations. Another increasingly important reward system concerns rules and procedures for allocating enforcing agent positions in the collectivity. This will be discussed further.

These obligations and rewards, while required for the continued existence of a collectivity, both complement and compete with the primitive obligations actors have for themselves and their primordial groups. They are complementary because the shared resources in the collectivity supplement human capital, so that shortage of human capital no longer need always be a threat to survival. They are competitive because energy allocation for resource production and loyalty commitments can be taxing.

There is the inevitable conflict of interest, however. Since primitive motives drive the actors to maintain and gain human capital rather than public capital, willingness to perform and be loyal to the collectivity and collective goods depends on at least two important factors: (1) how important the public capital is to the actors and (2) how collective obligations and rewards, in terms of loyalty and performance, synchronize with primary obligations and rewards. The more positive the two evaluations, the more likely the actors will be willing to perform and be loyal to the collectivity and the collective goods. In the extreme situation, an actor may be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, his or her own life, in order to preserve shared resources for the primordial group and the collectivity.

If the two factors are not seen as matched, two outcomes are likely.

The actor may choose to leave the collectivity, at the risk of losing public capital but in the hope of finding another collectivity better matched to the interest of ego and his or her primordial group. Alternatively, there is an increasing likelihood that the actor will become a free rider, who takes and treats shared resources as human capital. There are, of course, risks associated with both of these choices. Leaving increases the problem of protecting oneself and finding resources for survival. Free riders may run the risk of punishment (deprivation of human and public capital) established by the collectivity, which will be discussed later.

As the size of the collectivity increases, interactions become fragmented (localization of networks) and shared resources become segmented (localization based on shared resources and characteristics). At the collective level, obligations and rewards must be continuously revised to cover the increasing number of actors and their need for public capital.

As a result, the proportion of collective obligations and responsibility overlapping with individual actors and their primordial groups decreases. Routinized recognition and legitimation will decrease in their utility to bind actors to the collectivity.

Social Capital and Social Structure 139

Social Contracts

To ensure that collective obligations and rewards are perceived as matched with those of member actors, structural problems of fragmentation and segmentation are overcome, loyalty and performance are exercised, and exits and free rides are minimized, a collectivity can develop and employ three strategies: (1) cultivate actors through education and acculturation to internalize collective obligations and rewards (Bourdieu and Passeron 1977; Marini 1992); (2) engage in mass campaigns promoting the identification of the actors with the attractiveness of shared resources and the collectivity (Putnam 1993); and (3) develop and enforce rules for forced compliance . Kelman’s (1961) discussion of the three processes (internalization, identification, and compliance) implies that these strategies form points along two axes. Compliance can be achieved with maximal speed but a minimal span of effect. When control is present, compliance is quickly achieved (e.g., war prisoner’s behaviors). But when it is absent or lifted, such behaviors will also quickly change or disappear. Internalization, on the other hand, takes the longest time to achieve, but the consequent behaviors presumably persist with minimal control. Discussion of the employment of these strategies is beyond the scope of this chapter. What needs to be emphasized is that each of these strategies entails the development of rules of engagement for actors in the collectivity. Further, agents and agencies of enforcement must be developed.

These enforcing actors are used to administer and manage activities as well as enforce the collectivity’s rules. They are rewarded according to the evaluation of their performance. The emergence and necessity of these enforcing agents generates further relationships between actors and the collectivity. These agents assume authority over individual resources and act on the collectivity’s behalf. While they are expected to defend and expand individual actors’ resources as well, their ultimate rewards come from demonstrating loyalty to the collectivity and to public capital expansion.

As scarcity of resources increases and the collectivity grows in size, the enforcing agents gain prominence among members, as the collectivity’s survival increasingly depends on the agents’ enforcement of rules. One important means of integrating actors, shared resources, and rules is to specify positions (corporal actors) with defined roles relative to types and amounts of resources; to execute the rules; and to designate actors as occupants of the positions. Thus, a hierarchy among actors will emerge not only because of differential obligations and rewards, but also because of differential allocation and the opportunity to be enforcing agents.

140

Conceptual Extensions

These obligations, rewards, and opportunities form the basis of agency relative to the positions they occupy.

Sources of Tension in Social Systems

Space does not permit further elaboration of the relationships between corporal (enforcing) actors and natural actors, the formalization of legitimation and profit rules in the realized social system, and the perpetual tension between loyalty and profit for a social system and its individual and corporal actors. However, I can point out several sources of tension in social systems that can develop. The most obvious one is the tension between human capital and public capital. Because of the ultimate survival instinct and the cost of accessing public capital, there is a much stronger tendency for a natural person to strive for human capital. A social system needs to strike a balance between providing opportunities for the participants to maintain and gain reasonable amounts of human capital and enforcing their willingness to produce and maintain public capital.

A second source of tension is the balance between mobility and solidarity. Mobility represents the opportunity to move up in the social hierarchy, whereas solidarity is the need to share sentiment and legitimacy with regard to other participants’ interests and resources.9 Mobility encourages actors to break away from their social circle of shared interests and resources in order to gain more or better resources in the social system. Solidarity relies on identification with others who share similar 9 I define solidarity as the degree of sentiment and legitimacy regarding one another’s resources, as expressed by a collectivity’s actors. This conception is somewhat similar to Hechter’s (1983) conceptualization. Hechter, using a rational-choice perspective, suggests that the solidarity of a group become possible when two elements are present: (a) dependence relations between individuals and the group, as determined by access to alternative sources for resources, and (b) a monitoring capacity of the group in terms of both monitoring individuals’ behaviors and sanctioning behaviors via leadership. Thus, Hechter’s work can be seen as an attempt to specify further the interactions linking individuals to obligations and reciprocity and thereby to various market, authority, and norms systems that Coleman (1986a, 1986b) suggested but never specified. The first element identified by Hechter is a direct application of the dependence-power theory advanced by Emerson and Cook (Emerson 1962; Cook, Emerson, Gillmore, and Yamagishi 1983; Yamagishi, Gillmore, and Cook 1988). It emphasizes the significance of networking among individuals and issues of resources deemed valuable to individuals. It can follow from the basic argument of individuals seeking maximal resources through interactions with multiple actors. However, this resource-dependence or power argument, I would argue, is not a necessary condition for solidarity, which for me reflects more a mutual sentiment and thus a predisposition among members to reinforce and defend one another or shared resources. The second element, the monitoring capacity of the group via leadership, creates a component that hints at the legitimation process.

Social Capital and Social Structure 141

resources and sentiments. Overemphasis on mobility tends to break down social identity and group cohesion. Overemphasis on solidarity fragments sectors of the structure and creates potential class identification and conflict. Striking a balance between the two is critical for the survival of the social system.

Still another source of tension is related to the system’s size. One consequence of increasing size is decreasing shared resources relative to the amount of resources unique to member actors. Thus, the value attached to the commonality of shared resources decreases among the members.

This creates a tendency for member actors to form subsets of relations with others who share resources of common interest and value. Special interests and lobbying efforts by the subsets of actors and collectivities competing for rules in their favor can tip the legitimacy of the rules regarding the distribution of shared, especially public, resources available to the system. As shared resources become relatively more scarce, these competitions, if unchecked or unresolved, may lead to fragmenta-tion of loyalty. Loyalty then shifts to groups or clusters within the system rather than embracing the structure as a whole, endangering the identity and continued existence of the system as a whole. How to maintain the structure while it continues to grow in size and faces increasingly shared resources is an issue no open social system can avoid (see a similar discussion in Coleman 1986a, 1986b).

Concluding Remarks

In this chapter, I have proposed two types of rational principles for action, minimization of resource loss and maximization of gain, with the former claiming primacy. This position, in support of the primacy of action and the viability of rationality as a theoretical argument, challenges the exclusive use of the economic profit-maximization (or even profit-optimization) approach as the sole basis of accounting for human actions, interactions, and the functioning of social organizations. Further noneconomic but quite rational calculations naturally and logically flow from issues fundamentally linked to the nature of human life, such as reproduction and succession, sovereignty of property, and the need for recognition of such sovereignty – issues that any theory of human society cannot ignore but that the economic approach does.

Consideration of these issues does not relegate sociology’s significance to psychology or cultural anthropology. Claims to property rights, recognition, transfer of resources, and succession are clearly all socially driven.

They describe social life and social activities and are meaningful only in interactive and networking contexts.

142

Conceptual Extensions

Not only does rationality for action spring from the innate nature of human life, but principles of interactions cannot afford to ignore two different types of resources: personal and social. A model that considers only transactions of human capital will never be able to account for the links between actors and social structure, because social networks and social capital are at the core of the micro–macro link. Concepts of power, dependence, solidarity, social contracts, and multilevel systems do not make sense until social capital is brought into consideration.

This chapter demonstrates how several simplified propositions concerning principles of action and interaction thus conceived can explain the emergence of social structure from bases of action and interaction: an action theory of society. The propositions and theoretical arguments presented here, I believe, provide building blocks for further analysis of the formation and development of social institutions and organizations.

For example, considerations can be extended to multiple social contracts and the subsequent hierarchical structure subsuming these contracts by way of variations in the social (recognition), political (legitimation), and economic (profit) rules.

Once a social system is in place, it inevitably becomes the dominant aspect of social life. Its imposition on individuals is increasingly pervasive. Therefore, we must necessarily take structural effects as given when we describe observable social systems. I agree with Hannan’s observation (1992) that organizations take on characteristics that are unintended and unpredictable from individual actions. However, the principle of the robustness of social systems, I believe, is derivable from the same principles guiding individual actions and interactions. That is, principles of loss minimization and gain maximization, rules of resource transfer and succession, and the primacy of social (public and shared) capital over human capital guide institutions and organizations to establish rules in their authority, opportunity, and sociocultural structures. Collective interest supersedes individual interest, just as primordial group interest supersedes individual actor interest. Loyalty supersedes performance in reward/punishment rules as recognition supersedes profit for individual actors. While the principles are similar, the primacy of collectivity over individuals forges structural variations not accountable from individual action and interactions.

Ultimately, a viable social theory must integrate both individual and structural elements. A comprehensive and balanced treatment of these two elements, I suspect, is the challenge sociologists must accept in order to offer theories that are both analytically and descriptively valid. In the next chapter, I will continue the line of theorization commenced in this chapter and pursue the issue of why recognition, rather than resource gain, is an important element in exchanges.
