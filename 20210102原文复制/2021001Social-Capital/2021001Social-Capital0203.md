Structures

In the previous two chapters, I initiated a conceptual formulation in which motivations of actions are shown to lead to certain types of interactions and the utility of social capital. I suggested that actions lead to the emergence of social structures with increasing complexity of positions, authority, rules, and agency (Chapter 8). The purpose of this chapter is to extend this line of conceptualization by examining access to and use of social capital in the context of a complex social structure – an organization. Here I begin by assuming stable and functioning hierarchies such as organizations and assess how actors, through their positions, may or may not access better social capital – resources embedded in other positions, especially hierarchically higher positions. Thus, the concern here is, first, to demonstrate structural constraints and, second, to show how actions to access social capital operate within these constraints.

Recall that the theory of social capital proposes that, in addition to the principal proposition that social capital generates returns, two factors affect access to social capital (Chapter 5). The strength-of-position proposition hypothesizes that a given position of origin in the hierarchical structure determines in part how well one may gain access to better social capital. It is a structural factor and is independent of individuals in the structure, although individuals may benefit as occupants of the positions. In contrast, the strength-of-(network)-locations proposition hypothesizes the potential payoff for individual action. Since normal interactions are dictated by the homophily principle, going beyond the routine set of frequent interactions and seeking out weaker ties or bridges represents action choices beyond most of the interactions and structural positions’ normative expectations. In relative terms, the strength of position should have greater effects on social capital than the strength of network locations. This statement recognizes the significance of structural constraints everywhere in the social structure. The theoretical implications of these propositions will be further discussed later. In empirical 165

systems, both factors are expected to operate, even though their relative effects may vary.

In the studies examining social capital in the status attainment process (Chapter 6), empirical evidence thus far strongly supports two of the three hypotheses: the social-capital hypothesis and the strength-of-positions hypothesis. Those with better origins tend to find sources of better social capital in job searches, and contacting a source of better resources or generally having better social capital increases the likelihood of finding a better job. These relations hold even after the usual status-attainment variables (e.g., education and first-job status) are taken into account.

However, evidence is equivocal on the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis. A number of reasons have been offered for this; one could argue, for example, that strength of ties is not an adequate measure of the strength of network locations. More appropriate measures should reflect being part of a bridge or near a bridge, or being at or near structural holes, or being at locations with fewer structural constraints (Burt 1992, 1997).

Or the strength of weak ties has been measured more as role identifications (relatives, friends, or acquaintances) or lack of intimacy (Marsden and Campbell 1984) rather than as network locations. Currently, there is a lack of empirical evidence confirming that these alternative measures would yield different results.

Another line of conceptual reasoning proposes that this result may be due to the interaction between the two exogenous variables: the strength of position and the strength of network locations (e.g., weaker ties) (see Chapters 5 and 6) for instrumental actions. Lin, Ensel, and Vaughn (1981) hypothesized a ceiling effect for weak ties. At the top of the hierarchy there is no advantage to using weak ties, since such ties are likely to lead to inferior positions and therefore inferior resources. The authors did not anticipate that weaker ties would be similarly ineffective toward the bottom of the structure. Marsden and Hurlbert (1988) also found that actors with the lowest origins did not derive greater benefit from contacts with weaker ties in gaining access to better resources than from contacts with stronger ties. Assuming that the interaction effects between the strength of position and the strength of ties occur only at both very high and very low positions of origin, it is interesting to speculate on why such interactions take place there. This is not so difficult to explain for positions near or at the top of the hierarchy. But it is more difficult to understand why positions near or at the bottom of the hierarchy do not derive more benefit from weak ties, since the theory suggests that the increased likelihood of reaching better social capital through such contacts should hold true for occupants of the lowest positions in a hierarchical social structure.

Social Capital in Hierarchical Structures 167

To pursue this line of reasoning, we need to consider structural parameters that dictate the interplay between strength of position and strength of network locations. What is needed is a formulation in which predictions can be made regarding the relative significance of structural constraints (as represented by strength of position) and individual actions (as represented by strength of network locations), given such structural characteristics. These considerations have led to the exploration of structural parameters and an assessment of their effects on the propositions.

The remainder of this chapter delineates a set of structural parameters, variations of which provide the context for further specification of the two theoretical propositions.

Some terms require clarification here. I assume that a social structure consists of different levels, each of which can include a set of structurally equivalent positions. They are equivalent primarily on the basis of levels of similarly valued resources and authority and secondarily on the basis of similar lifestyles, attitudes, and other cultural and psychological factors. For our purposes here, the terms levels and positions are used interchangeably. Also, social mobility , as used here, refers to the voluntary aspect in an internal labor market. Involuntary social mobility, due to job dissatisfaction, lack of alternatives, or other「pushing」or forced factors, is excluded from consideration. As Granovetter (1986) pointed out, voluntary social mobility generally results in wage growth. Likewise, it is argued that voluntary social mobility accounts for the majority of rewards (greater authority, better wages and bonuses, and faster promotions) in hierarchies such as organizations.1

Structural Parameters and Their Effects

A hierarchy, I argue, can be described with variations and permutations of four general parameters: the number of levels in the hierarchy (the 1 It is true that the beginning of a job search is often unplanned (see Granovetter 1974).

Many job leads become available on casual occasions (e.g., parties) and through interactions with acquaintances. It is not necessarily the case that a job search begins with the purposive and active seeking out of contacts. However, this does not negate the basic premise that individuals are situated at different levels in the structure and therefore have access to casual settings involving persons who command certain types and amounts of resources and social capital. In fact, it has been empirically demonstrated (Campbell, Marsden, and Hurlbert 1986; Lin and Dumin 1986) that occupants of higher-level positions have greater access to more diverse and heterogeneous levels in the hierarchical structure than do occupants of lower-level positions and hence have greater command of social capital. Thus, it can be expected that casual settings for the higher-level positions are structurally richer in job information, as well as other types of information and influence. This structural advantage, deducible from the pyramidal assumption of the theory, has a distinct effect when the individual eventually launches a job search.

level differential ), the distribution (absolute and relative number) of the occupants across the levels (the size differential ), the distribution (absolute and relative amount) of valued resources across levels and among occupants (the resource differential ), and the sum of all occupants and resources in the structure. The first and last parameters are computed for the entire structure; the second and third parameters can be computed for either the entire structure or portions of it.

In general, the social capital proposition, the primary proposition of the social capital theory, should hold regardless of the variations in these parameters. As long as the structure is hierarchical, access to and use of better social capital are expected to facilitate socioeconomic returns under any structural variations. However, the other two hypotheses require further specification relative to variations in the structural parameters. In the following sections, I will describe each parameter and assess the impact of its variation on the two propositions. For simplic-ity, the two propositions will be identified as the positional effect (the strength of the original position) and the location effect (the strength of network locations). Again, we must remain conscious of the dominant effect of structural constraints. Strength of position should have a relatively stronger effect than strength of locations everywhere in the structure, whereas each factor may vary in different parts of the structure.

Also, for generality, I will examine the relative effects of structure (the strength of positions) and networking (the strength of locations). For networking effects, I will employ the general location argument: that is, for instrumental actions, locations at or near a bridge – variously referred to as structural holes , weaker ties , or less structurally constrained locations – reflect the strength of better locations in their likelihood of accessing better social capital. While the descriptions often implicate organizations or firms, it is hoped that the propositions can be generalized to all hierarchical structures.

The Level Differential

First, the hierarchical structure can be specified by the number of levels within it. A level is defined as a set of social positions that have a similar command of resources and access to capital (including social capital) per occupant. In the occupational structure, for example, the crudest differentiation is based on occupational classifications consensually agreed upon in a given society. Each such classification, however, may be based on a combination of requirements, including the degree and presence of certain skills, training, experience, tenure, and location in an industry, as well as resources. A better differentiation would be one based on

empirical examination of each occupational position’s command of resources and access to social capital. The clustering of equivalent positions would then constitute a level in the structure.2

As illustrated in the top two figures (a) in Figure 10.1, we can describe the variation by identifying two theoretical extremes. At one extreme, the left figure, there are only two levels in the structure, and at the other, the right figure, there are many levels. The two-level system is expected to resemble a caste system in which one level has either all or most of the valued resources and the other has none or few. Thus, the positional effect should be stronger. In the multilevel system, the differentiation of levels reduces the relative inequality of valued resources across levels and therefore the positional effect. Thus, the expectation is that the number of levels will be negatively related to the positional effect.

The two-level structure minimizes interactions between levels, reducing the opportunity for finding and using bridges. In the multilevel struc-2 Breiger’s work (1981) specifying a class hierarchy of occupations is based on the principles of internal and external heterogeneity of mobility. Thus, the classification system is deduced from mobility patterns rather than from resources and social capital. I suspect that there is a strong correspondence in the resulting empirical classifications based on the mobility and resource criteria. For theoretical and tautological reasons, an empirical derivation and demonstration of the resource-based hierarchies is necessary.

170

Conceptual Extensions

ture, however, bridging is maximized. This is not to deny that the networking effect should be present even in the two-level system whenever social ties across the two levels are formed. However, in this castelike arrangement, such ties are difficult to form and follow up on because there is little need for an upper-level occupant to respond to a relationship offered by a lower-level occupant, as all rewards (wealth, power, and reputation) can be found through social ties within the upper level.

The expectation is that the number of levels in the structure will be positively related to the networking effect.

Thus, the number of levels in a structure has opposite consequences for structural constraint and individual action. On the one hand, in the two-level system, the structural constraint is strongest and provides little opportunity for effects of individual actions. On the other hand, differentiation of many levels in a structure lessens structural constraints and provides more opportunity for individual actions that gain valued resources. These effects are consistent with the general empirical observation that social mobility is related to the gradations or number of strata in an occupational structure or a labor market. Rather than explaining such a relationship solely in structural terms, these subhypotheses argue that it is both the loosening of structural constraints and the greater opportunity for action choices that account for greater social mobility across levels in a multilevel structure. However, these effects assume that either the number of occupants at each level is the same or variations in the number of occupants do not have any effect. In most hierarchical structures, this is not true.

The Size Differential

Variations in the relative number of occupants across levels are expected to influence positional and location effects. As in the preceding section, we can discuss this influence by examining two extreme situations, as illustrated in the two figures in the middle panel (b) of Figure 10.1. At one extreme (the left figure), every level has the same number of occupants, and at the other (the right figure), every level has a different number of occupants, the relative number decreasing from the bottom to the top of the structure. In this discussion, the number of levels is held constant. For convenience, we assume a sufficient number of levels so that both the positional and tie effects may occur.

In the equal-size structure, the opportunity for heterophilous interaction is maximal for all occupants. That is, each occupant has an equal opportunity to contact a person at a different level. In Blau’s analysis of intergroup associations (Blau and Schwartz 1984; Blau 1985), he hypothesizes that in a two-group interaction situation, the intergroup association would be greater for the small group (i.e., the probability per

Social Capital in Hierarchical Structures 171

person in Group A of associating with a person in Group B increases as the size of Group A relative to the size of Group B decreases). If it is assumed that in a hierarchical structure the relative sizes tend to decrease toward the top, then the derivation is that intergroup association initiated from a lower (and presumably larger) level (e.g., Group B) to a higher (and presumably smaller) level (e.g., Group A) decreases as the difference between the relative sizes of the two levels increases. However, as the difference in the relative sizes of the levels decreases, such upward association would be increased. Thus, it is argued that in the extreme case, in which all hierarchical levels have a similar number of occupants, there is maximal opportunity for heterophilous interactions across all levels and therefore equal opportunity for socioeconomic returns. In other words, an individual at each level has an equal chance to move up the ladder. This does not mean that everyone in the structure will have an equal opportunity to attain the same highest status. Depending on his or her initial position in the structure, each person will have an equal opportunity to interact with another person at a different level and move up the ladder.

As variations in the number of occupants across levels increase, they inhibit upward cross-level contacts. Intralevel interaction opportunities increase as the size differential increases at all levels, because most of the occupants of the larger levels tend to interact with others at the same level. Assuming that the relatively small levels are higher in the structure, the relative lack of interlevel actions initiated by the lower-level occupants reduces the potential probability effects of weak ties. Thus, the expectation is that the size differential is negatively related to the network location effect.

However, when a lower level is relatively smaller, this expectation does not hold. In such a structure, the chance is greater that lower-level occupants will have a relatively larger number of contacts with occupants at an upper level, which in turn promotes opportunity for mobility to that upper level. For example, in a structure where farm-related levels have relatively fewer occupants than do nonfarm blue-collar sectors, the tie effect should be relatively strong in the status-attainment process.

As for positional effects, variations in occupant numbers across levels have a positive effect. As the size differential increases, intralevel interactions increase among occupants in the larger, and presumably lower, level. These intralevel interactions reinforce the positional effect. The paradox is that as size differentials increase, they also increase the relative opportunity of contacts for these occupants in the smaller level with those in the larger level. In a pyramidal hierarchy (the higher the level, the fewer the occupants), the closer the level to the top, the broader the range of contacts across levels for its occupants; yet these occupants benefit not from heterophilous interactions for socioeconomic returns,

172

Conceptual Extensions

but rather from their same-level contacts. In contrast, at or near the bottom of the structure, the opportunity for occupants who need heterophilous interactions for socioeconomic returns is structurally restricted by the large size of their level.

The Resource Differential

A third feature of the hierarchical structure is differential distribution of resources at various levels. Differentiation of levels can therefore be described in terms of distribution of resources as well as number of occupants. The resource differential can be calculated for the variation in resources across levels in a social structure or for a comparison between two levels. For the description of a social structure, as illustrated in the lower panel (c) in Figure 10.1, the resource differential may vary from minimal (when the resource differential is the same for every pair of contiguous levels) in the left figure to large (when it is different for every pair of contiguous levels) in the right figure. In the former case, the levels are said to be equidistant in resources. In the latter case, we assume that the differentials increase from the bottom to the top of the structure.

That is, the higher up in the structure, the greater the resource differential between two contiguous levels, with the upper level having many more resources per capita than the lower level. Although this assumption is yet to be examined empirically, it is based on the theoretical argument that a marginal incentive or reward of a given amount of resources decreases toward the top of the hierarchical structure. Therefore, an increasing amount of resources is expected toward the top to maintain the same degree of incentive or reward.

It is expected that the equidistant structure increases the opportunity for the location effect. Heterophilous ties are equally likely to be initiated at each level. In the unequal-distance structure, however, it is harder for lower-level occupants to overcome the resource distance across levels, especially toward the top of the structure. Thus, the expectation is that the resource differential will be negatively related to the location effect.

For the positional effect, the opposite should be true. As the resource differential increases, so does the importance of the position of origin for socioeconomic returns. In a structure with a large resource differential, any upward mobility is difficult. But in such a system, when upward mobility does take place, the position of origin rather than the use of network locations should account for the movements. If the structure is equidistant, the positional effect should be relatively small.

If this hypothesis is valid, two consequences follow within any given empirical structure. First, since the hierarchical structure, by definition,

Social Capital in Hierarchical Structures 173

rank-orders its levels by resources, it can be deduced that cross-level interactions are most frequent across contiguous levels and decrease for any two levels, depending on how far apart they are in the structure.

Thus, we predict that social mobility (especially socioeconomic returns) should most likely occur across contiguous levels.

Furthermore, inhibition of cross-level interactions is contingent on the difference in the relative amount of per capita resources at the two levels; the interactions between contiguous levels may be attenuated or suppressed as the resource differential increases. In a structure where resource differentials increase toward the top, we predict that social mobility in that direction becomes increasingly difficult. At the very bottom, however, the resource differential between levels may be quite trivial, and thus the cross-level interactions will be substantial.

One interesting aspect of these variations is the implication they hold for any interaction related to socioeconomic returns. It is clear from the discussion so far that, toward the upper levels, there is much advantage in initiating (upward) cross-level interactions, since there is much more to gain because of the resource differentials. However, such initiatives are less likely to be reciprocated, since higher-level occupants have much less to gain from interacting with others at the lower levels. The result should be fewer cross-level interactions and generally a smaller effect from such interactions, since upper-level occupants are less likely to reciprocate actions initiated by lower-level occupants. When the interactions are successful, probably owing mostly to the positional effect, however, the payoff for the job seeker should be substantial. At the bottom, in contrast, cross-level interactions have little advantage or disadvantage since the resource differentials are small. Therefore, although it is expected that cross-level interactions will be frequent, such interactions will not generate significant benefit for the participants.

The Totality of Occupants and Resources

The final feature of the social structure concerns the absolute number of occupants and resources in the entire structure (e.g., industrial sector).

Critical mass is used here to characterize the minimal requirements for a structure’s absolute quantities of population and resources. These requirements vary, depending on the relative sizes of populations and resources in the external environment with which the structure interacts.

Nevertheless, absolute numbers are important features of a structure.

Associations within the structure are strongly affected by the constraints as well as the opportunities to gain resources in the external environment. Thus, analysis must be extended to the larger structure of which the initial focal structure is but a substructure. For example, in under-

174

Conceptual Extensions

standing social mobility in a particular labor market, we may wish to analyze the structural parameters of that segment. Analyses, however, must eventually be extended to considerations of other segments, so that relative mobility patterns may be assessed across segments. For the larger structure, similar parameters (the level differential, the location differential, and the resource differential) may be utilized to examine possible cross-segment mobility. No further elaboration and extension of these parts are necessary in this chapter.

Implications for Structure and Individuals

In summary, a consideration of the structural parameters has enabled us to specify conditions under which the positional effect and the tie effect vary. In ideal-typical terms, the positional effect should be maximal when the structure contains (1) a minimal number of levels, (2) a large occupant differential across levels, and (3) a large resource differential across levels. The network location effect should be maximal when the structure has (1) a large number of levels, (2) a small occupant differential across levels, and (3) a small resource differential across levels. Again, we must keep in mind that, even when the tie effect is strongest, the positional effect remains dominant.

The positional effect can be seen as an indicator of structural effects, and the location effect (especially the use of weaker ties) suggests the consequences of individual action. As explicated earlier, the normative mode of interactions is homophilous, involving participants with similar socioeconomic characteristics. In contrast, the use of weak ties tends to result in interactions involving participants with dissimilar socioeconomic characteristics. Heterophilous interactions are not totally without benefit for participants from higher status levels, since they may subsequently request or demand services from the lower-level participants.

Nevertheless, the initiation and establishment of such interactions by lower-level persons represent action and effort. Viewed in this context, these principles have theoretical implications for the relative effects of structural constraints and individual choices. They also stimulate consideration of the dynamic balance between vertical (heterophilous) and horizontal (homophilous) interactions in a stable social structure. These implications will be briefly examined here.

Structural Constraints versus Social Capital The theory describes structural conditions under which structural constraints and individual actions affect social mobility. Thus, it is relevant

Social Capital in Hierarchical Structures 175

to the debate concerning structural versus action effects. In contemporary sociology, the structural view dominates. Much of the theoretical development and empirical work in the past three decades have supported and advanced the structural perspective. The theory presented here does not disagree with the view that structural effects are predom-inant. It also argues that the positional effect, for example, is relatively more important than the tie effect throughout the structure. However, the specification of structural parameters enables us to ask where and to what extent individual actions become possible and meaningful. The following discussion gives further attention to the relationship between this theory and selected prevailing structural theories.

Blau’s theory of heterogeneity and inequality, along with Emerson and associates’ dependence theory, exemplifies well the structural perspective.

In a nutshell, Blau (1977, 1985; Blau and Schwartz, 1984) has argued that the distribution of a dimension (attribute) and the number of variables differing among groups in a population dictate the extent of association across groups. When the distribution of a dimension varies over a number of nominal or graded groups, such heterogeneity (for nominal groups) and inequality (for graded groups) promote intergroup association and can be examined over multiple dimensions (attributes).

The extent of the congruence between the different heterogeneities and inequalities also affects intergroup association. When the differences in characteristics are closely related (consolidated), intergroup association should be low; when they are not closely related (cross-cutting), intergroup association should be high.

Although the present theory can be seen as an elaboration and extension of Blau’s theory, there are several differences between the two. First, the present theory focuses on two types of social action: instrumental actions for gaining valued resources and expressive actions for maintaining valued resources. Though this chapter deals specifically with socioeconomic returns and mobility, and therefore instrumental actions, the distinction between instrumental and expressive actions plays a central role in the theoretical structure and has immediate consequences for patterns of interactions. Patterns of association differ for instrumental and expressive actions (Lin 1982). The expectation is that vertical (heterophilous) actions and interactions are effective for instrumental purposes, whereas horizontal (homophilous) actions and interactions are effective for expressive purposes. In Blau’s formulation, there is a mixture of the two types of action, with the main emphasis perhaps on the latter.

Intergroup marriage, for example, might be seen as primarily expressive, yet there are circumstances in which marriage takes on an instrumental aspect as well. The specification of the two types of action should clarify potentially conflicting empirical results. It can be argued that Blau’s

176

Conceptual Extensions

theory should be relatively more valid for the class of interactions intended for expressive purposes.

Second, the two theories’ primary elements by which groups and positions are identified differ. Though both assume that these elements must be consensually arrived at, the basic criteria are different. For Blau, they are based on the attributes that people take into account in their social relations. For the theory presented here, they are based on resources.

Whereas Blau convincingly argues that the use of attributes based on their influence on social relations at the microlevel does not necessarily affect consequent intergroup relations, the criterion of resources used in the present theory does not involve such a conceptual tautology. In later writings (e.g., 1985), Blau recognized the significance of resources in the identification of attributes. A modification of the definition of attributes in resource terms may resolve the difficulty.

A further consequence of the difference in criteria used to define groups or positions is that Blau’s theory applies to both unranked and ranked groups, whereas the present theory assumes a hierarchical structure based on ranked positions. In the present theory, the determining factor of a social structure is the different amounts of valued resources various levels command. Therefore, the levels are hierarchically ordered.

This more restricted view of social structure offers an advantage in that it eliminates further controversy in ranking categorical variables.

Categories of ethnicity and religion may be ranked in some social systems but not in others. For the present theory, the valued resources must be gradable, even if some of them represent social categories (e.g., race and gender). As long as they are consensually considered to be valued resources for a social system, they form the basis of the hierarchy in the structure. Even for expressive actions, as I have argued elsewhere (Lin 1982, 1986), such a hierarchical view of the structure helps to formulate predictions about patterns of action and interaction within or across levels. This specification may help elaborate differential patterns of intergroup associations. One may postulate, for example, that when categorical variables represent valued resources in a given social system, both the heterogeneity hypothesis and the inequality hypothesis may hold, whereas they diverge for other categorical variables.

Finally, Blau focuses on variation in the distribution of the number of individuals as the major source of structural variation. For both the heterogeneity and inequality principles, population distribution over the various categories or statuses affects intergroup associations. Although he has also identified the number of subgroups as having an impact, he assumes in the bulk of his work that the number of subgroups can be standardized for comparative analysis (1985, pp. 10–11). In other words, his theory tends to treat the number of subgroups as a constant.

Social Capital in Hierarchical Structures 177

The present theory specifically identifies the level differential and the size differential, along with the resource differential, as separate structural parameters. The effects of heterogeneity and inequality as proposed by Blau, therefore, can and should be further specified relative to the variations in both the number of levels (or groups) and the number of persons in them. For example, if a pyramidal structure is compared with an inverse-pyramidal structure, the inequality coefficient may be similar but the interlevel (group) associations may differ drastically. Empirically, an inverse-pyramidal structure may not exist, as discussed earlier, but most structures will have portions in which a lower level has fewer occupants than an adjacent higher level (e.g., agricultural vs. service sectors).

For such a structure or substructure, the interlevel (intergroup) association is expected to be different from the usual one, in which the upper level has relatively fewer occupants. Likewise, while two structures have similar level and occupant differentials, their resource differentials may differ, and therefore their patterns of interlevel association may differ.

For example, in a two-level caste system, where a small minority holds most of the resources, the association between the occupants of the two levels should be substantially different from that in another system in which the level and size differentials of the two levels are similar and there is little difference in their resources.

Having noted these differences, we can now describe Blau’s association theory in greater detail. Chance encounters across levels or groups due to variations in a hierarchical structure can then be predicted according to the level differentials (the more levels or groups, the greater the number of such chance encounters), the size differentials (the more evenly distributed the occupants across levels or groups, the greater the number of such chance encounters), and the resource differentials (the smaller the difference in resources per capita across levels, the greater the number of chance encounters). The effects of the hierarchy (especially the resource differential), however, restrict these general principles of association. In the case of instrumental actions taken for the purpose of socioeconomic returns, reciprocity of association becomes problematic. For a person from a higher level to have a chance encounter with a person from a lower level may be structurally unavoidable (e.g., a banker and a cleaning lady), yet a more substantive and especially status-changing association (e.g., marriage) requires efforts to overcome the structural gap. It is for this type of association that the present theory attempts to clarify the potential effects of individual actions.

Similarly, the structural theory of Emerson and Cook can be explicated in view of the present theory. In their power-dependence theory, Emerson and Cook specify that structural parameters dictate exchange patterns and consequences, even though individuals engage in

178

Conceptual Extensions

such exchanges to maximize their resources (Emerson 1962; Cook and Emerson 1978; Cook 1982; Cook, Emerson, Gillmore, and Yamagishi 1983; Emerson, Cook, Gillmore, and Yamagishi 1983). In their theoretical formulation of exchanges, structural dependence, or constraints (number of available exchange partners and distance to sources possessing resources), the type of exchange (e.g., negatively connected networks, in which only one pair of individuals can engage in transactions with one type of resource, and positively connected networks, in which new resources depend on combining two or more types of resources) and the resource salience (amount of resources available to each individual) result in further resource differentiation among individuals.

By specifying these parameters in a hierarchical structure, the present theory helps to predict in what types or parts of structures the rate of increasing dependence or resource differentiation will be faster or slower.

If it is assumed that the resource differential increases toward the top of the structure, one would predict that power or resource differentiation increases faster for occupants positioned closer to the top of the structure. The size differential also predicts differences in the speed of differentiation. The greater the differential, the greater this differentiation, since the larger number of occupants at the lower levels will have fewer opportunities to interact with occupants at the higher levels. The level differential delineates resource distance and should help generalize to larger structures the experimental results of the Emerson–Cook studies, in which the number of positions/levels and occupants is necessarily limited.

Furthermore, the present theory fleshes out possible variations in actions taken by individuals in similarly structured positions. Cook and Emerson (1978) briefly examined such variations by demonstrating the effects of a stronger sense of equity and a stronger sense of commitment on resource differentials; they found some evidence that exercise of power or demand for resources was either curtailed (especially for women) or increased (especially for men). Such data hint at the possibility that individual actions vary beyond predictions based on their structural characteristics. The present theory, with its explicit specification of structural parameters that predict where such individual actions may be relatively large or small, may well refine and elaborate the strictly structural interpretation of the dependence theory to accommodate such empirical variations.

Individual Action versus Social Capital

As stated earlier, the individual perspective, rather than the psychological deductive viewpoint, has emerged in the American sociological liter-

Social Capital in Hierarchical Structures 179

ature. The effects of individual actions can be explored from two perspectives. The first focuses on the structural formations or changes due to such actions. For example, Coleman (1986a, 1986b, 1990) argues that social actors promoting their interests engage in social relations that, depending on the specific purposes of the actions involved, may result in a market system, an authority system, or a normative system. He describes the process by which each system evolves, emphasizing the emergence of norms and sanctions from the interacting actors with their respective interests. Rational or cognitive action is the assumed force in the forging of social relations and subsequent structures. In contrast, Collins (1981) sees emotion as the ultimate force behind interactions, in which individuals seek positive reinforcement and claim membership.

Chains of such interaction rituals eventually form and provide cultural (conversational) and energy resources for repeated interactions, which develop into formal organizations and informal groups. These proposals focus on how individual actions can result in structural forms.

From the second perspective, individual actions are possible and meaningful under structural constraints. Burt’s work (1982, 1992) explores structural actions, or actions taken by individuals who are at the same or neighboring positions to protect or promote their common resources and interests. He argues that individuals from different positions can coopt to alleviate structural constraints, and in the process can modify the structure of relationships.

Integration of these two perspectives and the present theory has interesting results. In Chapter 8, it was argued that social capital provides the critical link between individual interests and the emergence of structure.

To have resources, one must form ties with others initially to protect and eventually to gain resources. Maintenance and protection of resources are seen here as driven by emotional or expressive forces, whereas resource gain requires mobilization of instrumental and cognitive motives and action. The resulting horizontal (homophilous) and vertical (heterophilous) interactions and relations constitute the elementary forms of social structure. Social structure allows access to and use of resources not necessarily in each individual’s possession. Differential ability to manage and manipulate social capital helps dictate the emergence of hierarchical positions. Variations in the structural parameters are the evolutionary consequences of the emerging process and its interaction with external structures and resources.

Once structural parameters have become dominant forces, access to and use of social capital continue to motivate individual actions wher-ever and whenever possible in the hierarchical structure. The parameters (level differentials, size differentials, and resource differentials) assume different significance for different types and parts of the hierarchical structure. For example, the extent of collective actions by a given level’s

occupants, as well as the outcomes of such actions, are dictated by the relative number of occupants not only at the given level but also across levels. It would be interesting to postulate the structural conditions under which such collective actions will result in further consolidation of the given levels or elimination of variations in structural parameters. In the next section, one such analysis is offered as an illustration.

Mobility and Solidarity: Some Policy Implications I have speculated (Lin 1982) that a stable social system requires a balance of opportunities for both homophilous and heterophilous exchanges. A system that does not provide sufficient opportunities for heterophilous exchanges reduces the opportunity for mobility and will experience fragmented populations with strong intralevel solidarity. This intralevel solidarity will promote the development of level (class) consciousness and potential class conflict. In contrast, a system that encourages a great degree of heterophilous exchange will experience much mobility and hence structural instability since solidarity will not prevail within population groups. The consequence may be a chaotic society in which transient interactions and lack of group solidarity threaten the integration of the system itself.

What this implies is that the structure must strive for adjustments in the number of levels, the distribution of occupants and resources among those levels, and the cumulation of occupants and resources. An increase in the differentiation of levels, perhaps inevitable in the industrialization process, must be accompanied by a redistribution of occupants and resources. That is, the size differential and the resource differential must be kept at reasonable ratios between levels. Significant size and resource differentials usually indicate a rigid structure.

As a crude illustration, let us assume that the American occupational structure is segmented by sex and race. We assume that occupational mobility follows sex and race specifications (e.g., a position vacated by a white male is filled by another white male). The 1999 distribution of occupants of the five major U.S. occupational categories (managerial and professional, technical, sales and administrative support, production/

operations, and farm) by sex and race is shown in Table 10.1. For each race-by-sex combination, we may construct the occupant differential between two assumed contiguous occupation categories by dividing the occupant size of the「higher」category by that of the「lower」one. For example, for white males, the occupant differential between service occupations and production/operations occupations is .25 (5,694/23,084) and the occupant differential between administrative support occupa-

tions and service occupations is 2.12 (12,069/5,694). Assuming that the resource differentials are the same across these three occupational categories, the present theory would predict that structural constraints on mobility from production/operation occupations to service occupations are quite high: the positional effect would be strong and the tie effect weak. Structural constraints, however, should be quite low for mobility from service to administrative support occupations, where the positional effect is expected to be small and the tie effect large. These and other occupant differentials are presented in Table 10.2.

Now we can compare the patterns of mobility opportunities and the relative positive and tie effects for white and black males and females.

As Table 10.2 shows, both black males and black females have greater structural constraints than their white counterparts for mobility to higher white-collar occupations (from service to administrative support, 1.05

and 1.38 for black males and females and 2.12 and 2.48 for their white counterparts; and from administrative support to managerial occupa-

tions, .97 and .64 for black males and females and 1.51 and .83 for their white counterparts). Thus, we would expect that for black males and females to move up in these white-collar occupations, they should expect relatively stronger position effects and weaker tie effects. Comparing males and females, we find that females do not suffer as much structural constraint in moving from service to administrative support jobs, but they do suffer greater structural constraint than their male counterparts in moving from administrative support to managerial occupations (1.51

and .97 for white and black males, respectively, and .83 and .64 for white and black females respectively). In attempting to move to the top tier of the occupational pyramid, then, females should expect relatively stronger position effects and weaker tie effects.

These are very crude data. We are not sure if, in fact, the American occupational structure is rigidly segmented by race and sex (in fact, we know that to some extent that this is a false assumption). The occupational categories here have been kept to a minimum (Breiger 1981, for example, proposed an eight-category classification for a hierarchical structure of American occupations). And the assumption that the resource differentials are constant across levels (occupational categories) is probably invalid. But given these assumptions, the theory informs us that, in such a structure, race and gender do make a difference in occupational mobility. Faced with greater structural constraints in moving up in white-collar occupations, blacks and females would experience difficulty in mobilizing social capital to overcome such structural deficiencies. Thus, the research agenda should shift to finding out how to make access to social capital more likely for structurally disadvantaged blacks and females.

This demonstration (within the limitations set by our assumptions) illustrates the utility of the social capital theory from both the structural and the individual perspectives. At the macrostructural level, the search for ways to overcome such constraints stimulates policy considerations.

Is it possible to create vacancies to equalize the size differential? Is it possible to equalize the resource differential? Is it possible to combine these moves in some way? Or should the structure address the issue of real-location of vacancies across sex and racial categories, thereby emphasizing the interfirm labor market rather than the internal labor market perspective (see such a position advocated in Granovetter 1986)? Unless the structure is capable of making such adjustments, chances are that mobility opportunities will remain structurally unequal and discontent will increase. In extreme cases, such immobility is cause for social revolution.

At the individual level, awareness of structural constraints and of flexibility within them may be reflected in the process of cognitive evalua-

tion. To the extent that such evaluation is engaged in, the individual has the option of initiating action by seeking out heterophilous ties and better social capital. Because the nature, range, and quality of such ties vary at different levels in the hierarchy, the benefits of seeking them out also vary. There is also a risk of nonreciprocated action when the structural gap is too great, along with a loss of identification with other occupants of the initial level. Both may lead to a sense of alienation.
