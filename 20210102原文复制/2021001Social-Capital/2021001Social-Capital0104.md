# 0104. Resources, Motivations, and Interactions: The Action Foundation

As conceptualized in the previous chapter, social capital is rooted in social networks and social relations and is conceived as resources embedded in a social structure that are accessed and/or mobilized in purposive actions. Thus conceived, social capital contains three components intersecting structure and action: structure (embeddedness), opportunity (accessibility through social networks), and action (use). The previous chapter has articulated the structural and opportunity aspects of social capital. This chapter will add the component of action to complete the theoretical foundation.

如前一章所定义的，社会资本植根于社会网络与社会关系之中，是在目的性行动中被获取和 / 或被动员的嵌入在社会结构中的资源。可以认为，社会资本包含结构和行动相互交叉的三个组成部分：结构（嵌入性）、机会（通过社会网络的可获取性）和行动（使用）。前一章述了社会资本的结构与机会方面，这一章将会论及行动要素，以完成社会资本的理论基础。

## 4.1 It’s Not Just What You Know but Who You Know: The Microstructure of Resources

The saying「It’s not just what you know but who you know」suggests that social capital should provide benefits for an individual who acts for a purpose. In this context, interaction is seen as a means to attain a goal of action. The task here is to understand how action is related to interaction and how agency is salient in the process of mobilizing social capital in a purposive action. I begin with a discussion of resources embedded in actors.

Individuals, like groups and organizations, gain and maintain valued resources to promote their well-being. They can mobilize and use such resources in purposive action to gain additional resources (see Chapter 1 for the discussion of neo-classical theories of capital).

Just as important, possession of or access to resources protects and promotes an individual’s standing in the social structure. Social recognition confers identity and reputation, providing recognized individuals with still more resources and a sense of worth and security within the structure. In general, two types of resources 41

can be defined for individual actors: personal resources and social resources.

Personal Resources as Human Capital

Personal resources are in the possession of individual actors who, as their owner, can use, transfer, and dispose of them without needing to receive specific authorization or be accountable to other actors or social positions.1 Acquisition of personal resources can be pursued down many avenues. One major route is by way of inheritance or ascription.

Resources may be declared the individual actor’s by transfer from parents, kin, or other actors. By the institutional rules of the community, they are passed on from one individual actor to another. Another avenue is to acquire them by investing one’s own resources or efforts. Education, for example, has been seen as an acquired resource through investment of parental or personal resources and personal efforts. Presumably, investment in education also leads to acquisition of other valued resources (e.g., power, wealth, and reputation) (see Chapter 1 on education as human and cultural capital).

A third way of acquiring personal resources is through exchange.

Acquisition of personal resources may involve a direct payment (money) or exchange of resources (bartering) through which title to resources is transferred from one individual actor to another. It is possible to delay the payment or exchange; in this case, a personal credit or debt is incurred on either side, with the expectation that the credit slip (promise of future payment) will be honored. Nevertheless, in pure exchange there is no expected obligation beyond the payment of the debt itself and no expectation of further exchanges. Personal property, commodities, money, and labor are typical resources in such exchange.

Some personal resources are fully owned by an individual actor (e.g., education, wealth) in the sense that the individual actor is free to use and dispose of them.2 But they are usually「owned」only by social contract, which designates an individual actor to be the user of specific resources – typical property rights designation (see Alchian 1965 and Alchian and Demsetz 1973 for a definition of property rights). As long as the contract is in force, the individual actor can exercise power in resource control and use. For example, an occupant of a position in a 1 However, a larger or external community’s (e.g., the state) sanction is necessary for such use and appropriation. See the references in footnote 2 in Chapter 3, in particular Willer (1985) on the legal sanctions for property rights.

2 Some resources are more difficult to dispose of than others. For example, education seems permanent after acquisition and certification, even though discrediting or disqualifica-tion (disownership) may still be possible and legitimate under certain conditions.

hierarchical structure has the right to control and use the resources attached to that position. These ownership rights expire when the individual actor is detached from that position. Therefore, it is useful to distinguish positional resources from the more fully owned personal resources.

While positional resources are less permanent, they are much more powerful as far as the other resources they control are concerned. Being part of a hierarchical structure with authority and linkages offers opportunities for the actor-occupant to have access to other actor-occupants and borrow or exchange resources. In other words, through structural connections, positions in hierarchical structures gain control and use of resources beyond those that these positions are allocated. It is in this context that we need to go beyond personal resources and explore resources accessed through social connections, that is, social capital.

Social Resources as Social Capital

As already indicated, not all resources available to individual actors are in their personal (including contractual) possession. In fact, personal resources for most individual actors are very limited. More likely, individual actors access resources through social ties. We define social resources , or social capital , as those resources accessible through social connections. Social capital contains resources (e.g., wealth, power, and reputation, as well as social networks) of other individual actors to whom an individual actor can gain access through direct or indirect social ties. They are resources embedded in the ties of one’s networks.

Like personal resources, social resources may include material goods such as land, houses, car, and money and symbolic goods such as education, memberships in clubs, honorific degrees, nobility or organizational titles, family name, reputation, or fame.3

Resources an actor can be linked to through her or his social networks4

3 It is important to differentiate two types of social resources: social capital and cultural capital. Social capital is resources captured through social networks and social connections, whereas cultural capital is resources captured through social identification and reciprocal recognition. It is conceivable that some social resources, for certain actors, are captured through both identification (being a member of an ethnic group) and social networks (with ties to other members of the ethnic group), whereas other social resources for other actors are captured through either identification or social networks. Further articulation of the differentiation and integration of these two types of capital is beyond the scope of this volume. The focus here is on social resources captured through social relations – social capital.

4 Individual actors’ own knowledge of resources embedded in their ties may be only a subset of the actual types and amounts of their social capital. This is so for two reasons: they are unaware of all their alters’ (direct ties’) resources and/or of the ties and resources in their alters’ networks. Thus, individual actors’ social capital can be divided into two parts: (a) the portion that they are aware of and (b) the remaining unknown portion.

represent a repertoire of ego resources. Even if ego does not use or mobilize these resources, they have substantial symbolic utility. Letting others know about one’s social capital may be sufficient to promote one’s social standing. The symbolic utility occurs because such information imputes the potential power of ego by association. Spreading information about ego’s having a millionaire friend provides better social recognition for ego in her or his social circle because the alleged potential is there for ego to activate the connection and draw on that resource if necessary.

Symbolic utility also occurs because such a connection reflects ego’s social or cultural standing. Information about one’s acquaintance with a movie star may not impute any power in action, but it can enhance ego’s social recognition because it suggests that ego, through interactions with the movie star, could share and enjoy a lifestyle much admired in ego’s social circle. Mentioning a tie (「So and so is a friend,」「I talked to so and so yesterday」) may be sufficient to promote ego’s social standing. Of course, social capital can provide utility beyond its symbolic power. Actual use of social capital mobilizes it for a purposive action, a topic to be treated in Chapter 5.

Two important features of social capital deserve further clarification: (1) resources can be accessed through direct and indirect ties, and (2) such resources may be in alters’ possessions (their personal resources) or in their social positions (their positional resources). First, social capital includes the resources accessed through indirect ties. Resources of alters (direct ties) represent a relatively small portion of ego’s social capital.

Often social capital activates chains of multiple actors. In order to gain access to a certain resource (say, information about a job), ego may go to someone who does not possess that information but who may know someone else who does. In this case, the initial contact’s social networks become resources for ego. Thus, social capital does not come merely through direct connections or simple dyadic relationships. Both direct and indirect connections can afford access to resources. Through the direct and indirect ties of alters, actors’ social capital extends as far as their social networks. That is, social capital is contingent on resources embedded in direct and indirect ties and accessible through these ties.

Second, resources accessed through social ties include both these alters’

more or less permanent resources and the resources they control through their positions in a hierarchical structure, say an organization – their positional resources. In general, the positional resources of social ties are much more useful than personal resources to ego, because positional Actors’ self-reporting inevitably yields an incomplete and conservative estimate of their social capital’s potential repertoire. Self-reporting may yield different estimates than sociometric methods. There is no true estimate because that if social capital is not within individual actors’ cognitive maps, it may be inaccessible and not useful to them.

resources evoke not only the resources embedded in positions in an organization, but also the power, wealth, and reputation of the organization itself. Two equally competent professors who are respectively affiliated with an Ivy League university and a state four-year college, or two equally competent professional programmers, one of whom works for Microsoft and the other for a small local software company, will have quite unequal positional resources, even if their personal resources, including knowledge and earnings, are equal, because the positional and personal resources of their respective colleagues may be quite different in quality. Through these alters, ego gains access not only to their resources, both permanent and positional, but also potentially to resources through their connections in the organization, as well as the power, wealth, and status of the organization itself.

Furthermore, because each organization is located in a network of organizations, ego’s social capital extends beyond the limits of the organization. Through the organization’s linkages, both direct and indirect, to other organizations, and through the ties’ connections to these other organizations’ position occupants, ego’s social capital may extend to include resources embedded in these other organizations.

不仅是你知道什么而且是你认识谁：资源的微观结构

谚语「不仅仅是你知道什么而且是你认识谁」表明，社会资本应该给为某个目的而行动的个体提供好处。在这种情况下，互动是实现行动目标的手段。这里的任务是理解行动如何与互动联系在一起，在目的性行动中能动作用如何在社会资本的动员过程中变得突出。我从嵌入在行动者中的资源开始讨论。

像群体和组织一样，个体获得和维持有价值的资源是为了增进他们的福利。他们可以在目的性行动中，动员和使用这些资源来获得额外的资源（参见第一章中对新经典资本理论的讨论）。拥有或者获取资源，对于保护和改善个体在社会结构中的地位非常重要。社会认可予行动者身份和名誉，为被认可的个体提供了更多的资源与结构内的价值和安全感。个体行动者通常有两类资源：个人资源和社会资源。

### 作为人力资本的个人资源

个人资源为个体行动者所拥有。作为拥有者，他们可以使用、转移和处置它们，而不需要得到授权或对其他行动者和社会位置负责。获得个人资源有很多方法。一个主要途径是通过继承或先赋。个体行动者可以通过父母、亲属或其他行动者的转让而获得资源。按照社区的制度性规则，资源从一个个体行动者向另一个转移。另一个途径是通过对自己的资源的投资和努力来获取。例如，教育已经被视为通过父母或个人资源和个人努力的投资而获得的资源。可能教育投资也导致其他有价值资源的获得（如权力、财富和名誉）（参见第一章作为人力和文化资本的教育）。

获得个人资源的第三个途径是交换。个人资源的获得可以通过直接支付金钱），或者经过资源交换（物物交换）从一个个体行动者向另一个手中转移。可能会出现支付或交换的延迟现象，在这种情况下，个人的信用或债务就会在双方身上发生，并伴随着信用票据（将来支付的承诺）被承兑的期待。然而，在纯粹的交换中，没有超越还债本身之外的义务，也没有进一步交换的期待。个人财产、商品、金钱和劳动都是典型的交换资源。

有一些个人资源在某种意义上被个体行动者完全拥有（如教育、财富），个体行动者可以自由地使用和处置它们。但很多这类资源通常只被社会契约所「拥有」，社会契约规定了个体行动者成为特定资源的使用者一警如，较典型的财产权规定（参见 Alchian,1965; Alchian and Demsetz,1973 对财产权的定义）。只要契约有效，个体行动者就可以行使权利，控制和使用资源。例如，在等级制结构中某一位置的占据者，有权利控制和使用与

[1 然而，一个更大的或外部的社区（如国家）的认可对这些使用和利用是必需的。参见第三章脚注 2 的引文，特别是威勒（Willer,1985）关于财产权的法律约的论述。

[2] 一些资源比其他的更难处置。例如，教育在获得和拿到证书之后似乎是永久的，即使被怀疑或取消（否认有效），在某些条件下仍然可用、合法。

那个位置有关的资源。当个体行动者与位置相分离的时候，这些权利也就消失了。因此，有必要把位置资源和能更完全的为个人所拥有的资源区分开来

虽然位置资源不甚长久，但是只要想到它们还控制着其他资源，就会觉得它们更有用。作为拥有权威和联系的等级制结构的一部分，它们为行动者一占据者提供了接近其他行动者一占据者的机会，以借取和交换资源。换言之，等级制结构中的位置，通过结构联系，获取和使用的资源超出了这些位置自身所被分配的。因此，我们需要超越个人资源，去考察通过社会联系所获取的资源，也即社会资本

### 作为社会资本的社会资源

前面已经说明，并不是所有个体行动者可以利用的资源都属于他们个人所有（包括契约性的）。实际上，对大部分个体行动者而言，个人资源是常有限的。更可能的是，个体行动者通过社会关系来获取资源。我们将社会资源，或者社会资本，定义为通过社会关系获取的资源。社会资本包含其他个体行动者的资源（如财富、权力、声望和社会网络等），个体行动者可以通过直接或间接的社会关系获取他们。社会资本是嵌入在关系网中的资源。像个人资源一样，社会资源包括物质财富（如土地、房屋、汽车和金钱），和象征财富（如教育、俱乐部成员资格、受人尊敬的学位、贵族或组织头衔、姓氏、声望和名声）

[3 区分两类社会资源一一社会资本和文化资本ー一非常重要。社会资本是通过社会网络和社会联系获得的资源，而文化资本是通过社会认同和相互认可而获得的资源。可以想到，一些社会资源对某些行动者来说，既通过认同（是少数族群的成员）又通过社会联系（和其他少数族群成员的关系）获得，而其他行动者的其他社会资源，或者通过认同或者通过社会씨络获得。对这两类资本的分化和整合的进一步闻述，超出了本书的范围。这里关注的是通过社会关系获得的资源一社会资本。

个行动者通过她或他的社会网络连接的资源代表了自我资源的全

集。即使自我不能使用或动员这些资源，它们也有很大的符号效用。让别人

知道自己的社会资本，可以很好地改善自己的社会地位。符号效用的产生是

因为这些信息通过联系来表现自我的潜力。因为存在着所谓的潜力自我在必要时可以激活社会联系并利用那些资源，因此，散布关于自己有很多朋友的信息为自我在其社会閉子中提供了很好的社会认可。

符号效用也因为这样的联系反映了自我的社会或文化地位而发生。关于

与一个电影明星相识的信息可能不会产生任何行动的权力，但是它可以提高

自我的社会认可，因为它意味着自我通过与电影明星的互动，能够分享和享受自己的社会圈子很羨慕的生活方式。提到一个关系（「某某是我的朋友

「昨天我眼某某说话了」）足以提高自己的社会地位。当然，社会资本可以提

供超出符号权力的效用。社会资本的实际用处是在目的性行动中的动员里这个主题将在第五章讨论。

社会资本的两个重要特征值得进一步澄清：(1）资源可以通过直接和

间接关系被获取；(2）这些资源可以被他人拥有（他们的个人资源），也可

以在其社会位置中（他们的位置资源）。首先，社会资本包括通过间接关系

获取的资源。他人的资源（直接关系）代表着自我的社会资本的一个相对小的部分。社会资本经常激活多个行动者的链条，为了某种资源（比如关于作的信息），自我可以去找并不拥有这些信息但知道谁有的人。在这种情况下，最初联系的社会网络成为自我的资源。这样，社会资本不只是通过直接联系或简单的二人关系，直接和间接的联系都能获取资源。通过他人的直接和间接关系，行动者的社会资本尽可能广地扩展他们的社会网络。这就是

[4] 个体行动者自己知道的嵌入在他们关系中的资源，可能只是他们的社会资本的实际类型和数量的子集。这里有两个原因：个体行动者不知道他们拥有的全部的他人的（直接关系的）资源和 / 或他人的网络中的关系和资源。因此，个体行动者的社会资本可以分成两部分：(a）他们所知部分；(b）不所知部分。行动者的自我报告不可避免地会对他们的社会资本的潜在的全集产生一个不完全的和保守的估计。自我报告会产生不同于社会测量法的估计。当然不存在真实的估计，因为，如果社会资本不在个体行动者的认知地图之内，那么它对行动者而言是不可获取、没有用处的。

说，社会资本取决于嵌入在直接和间接关系中的资源，并且这些资源可以通过这些关系获取。

第。通过社会关系获取的资源既包括他人的或多或少的永久性资源，又包括他们通过等级制结构中的位置控制的资源，比如说一个组织一他们的位置资源。社会关系的位置资源通常比自我的个人资源要有用的多，因为位置资源唤起的不仅是嵌入在组织中的位置上的资源，而且包括组织自身的权力、财富和声望。两个实力相当的教授分别在常春藤大学和州立大学任职，或者两个实力相当的专业程序员，一个为微软工作，另一个为一个小的地方软件公司工作，即使他们的个人资源，包括知识和收，是相等的，但他们将会拥有不相等的位置资源，因为他们各自同事的位置资源和个人资源可能在质上是非常不同的。通过这些他人，自我获取的不仅是他们自身的资源一一永久的与位置的，而且包括通过他们在组织中的联系和组织自身的权力、财富和地位所获取的潜在资源。

而且，因为每一个组织都处在组织中，因此自我的社会资本的扩展超越了组织的约束。通过组织与其他组织的直接和间接的联系，通过与这些其他组织的位置占据者的关系的联系，自我的社会资本可以扩展到嵌入在这些其他组织中的资源。

## 4.2 Motives for Resources: Purposive Actions

Once it has become clear that individual actors have in their possession and access valued resources, it is then not difficult to understand human actors’ motives for action and the consequences of different types of action. As stated in Chapter 2, both collectivities and individual actors take action for two primary motives: to protect existing valued resources and to gain additional ones. That is, it is assumed that actions are rational and are motivated to maintain or gain valued resources in order to survive and persist. The first motive dictates actions to preserve valued resources already at the individual’s disposal. The second motive promotes actions to acquire valued resources not yet at the individual’s disposal.

It is assumed that the motive to maintain valued resources promotes expressive action. Maintaining one’s resources requires recognition by others of one’s legitimacy in claiming property rights to these resources or sharing one’s sentiments. The action, of course, can be seen as instrumental in that ego has a goal in acting – to solicit sentiment and support.

However, the expected response is primarily expressive: acknowledging ego’s property rights or sharing ego’s sentiment. There is no action required beyond this public recognition and acknowledgment of others.

Examples include a mother talking with another mother about her affec-

tion for her children, a woman talking to her mother about her husband’s watching too much football on television, a man sharing his feeling of admiration for a woman with a friend, and a man complaining about his boss to his wife. In these cases, the act of communicating serves as both means and goal; alters are expected to sympathize and empathize with ego and to appreciate and reciprocate ego’s feelings, thereby recognizing, legitimizing, and sharing ego’s claims to their resources.

Further, it is assumed that the motive to seek and gain additional valued resources primarily evokes instrumental action, which hopes to trigger actions and reactions from others leading to more allocation of resources to ego. Thus, the action can be seen as a means to achieve a goal: to produce a profit (added resources). Likewise, instrumental action contains expressive elements in that alter must have sentiment for ego to take action on ego’s behalf. However, action is required on alter’s part, and the end result is expected to be a gain for ego. Examples include seeking a job, promotion, salary, or bonus increase; getting a loan; finding a babysitter; or looking for a job for one’s son.

It should be noted that both types of action represent purpose or agency because motivations provide the drive to act. Of the two motivations for action – to maintain or to gain resources – it is assumed that the motivation to maintain and defend existing resources is the more important driving force. Losing resources in one’s possession poses a greater mental and physical threat to ego’s existence than not gaining additional resources. Thus, expressive action – action that seeks sentiment and support – is expected to take precedent over instrumental action (see Chapter 3).

These motivations for action result in two behavioral consequences: either actors can engage in activities by themselves that can produce better protection or gain resources, or they can engage one another to use one another’s resources. It is the latter case that is of interest here for a theory of social capital. Purposive actions must therefore be understood in terms of interactions that allow actors to access and use one another’s resources for their own purposes. We next examine the two types of interaction – homophilous and heterophilous – and assess their utilities for purposive actions.

获取资源的动机：目的性行动

旦个体行动者拥有和获取的有价值资源凊楚了，那么理解人类行动者的行动动机和不同类型的行动后果就不困难了。如第二章所讨论的，无论集体还是个体行动者的行动都有两个主要动机：保护既有的有价值资源和获得额外的资源。也即，我们可以假定行动是理性的，而行动的动机是为了生存和延续而维持或取得有价值的资源。第一个动机为保持已持有价值资源来行动。第二个动机促进了争取尚未持有价值资源的行动。

假定维持有价值资源的动机促进了表达性行动的发生。维持资源需要他人对要求获得这些资源的财产权以及与他人分享自己的情感的合法性的认

可。当然，行动可以被视为工具性的，因为自我在行动中有一个目标一一要求得到情感与支持。然而，期待的回应主要是表达性的：承认自己的财产权或分享自己的情感。不存在需要超越这种公共认可与他人的承认的行动。包括下列例子：一位母亲与另一位母亲谈她对孩子的爱；一位妇女与母亲谈他的丈夫整天看电视足球转播；一个男人与他的朋友分享他对恋人爱慕的感情一位丈夫向妻子抱怨自己的老板。在这些情况下，沟通行动既是目标又是手段；他人被期待着对自己同情和共鸣，欣赏与交换自己的情感，从而认识到同意和分享自我对他们的资源的要求。

进一步假定，寻找和获得额外有价值资源的动机主要唤起的是工具性行动，它将引起他人的一系列行动与反应，分配给自我更多的资源。因此，行动被视为实现目标的手段：产生利润（增加资源）。同样，工具性行动包括情感因素，因为他人对你有感情才能采取行动帮助你。然而，行动需要他人的同意，最终结果被期待着对自己有益处。这样的例子包括：找工作、晋升、提工资或奖金、获得贷款、找保姆或为儿子找工作。

应该注意，两种类型的行动都代表着目的或能动因素，因为动机提供了行动的动力。这两种行动动机中一维持或获得资源假定维持和保护既有资源的动机是更重要的动力。丧失已经拥有的资源比获得额外资源对自我的生存会产生更大的精神和身体威胁。因此，表达性行动一寻找情感和支持的行动一被认为比工具性行动更重要（参见第三章）。

这些行动动机产生了两个行为结果：行动者可以自行主导的活动，以产生更好的保护或获得资源，或者他可以与其他行动者互动，使用彼此的资源在这里，后面一种情况对社会资本理论有意义。目的性行动必须通过互动能被理解一为了各自的目的，行动者互动而获取和使用彼此的资源。我们下面探讨两类互动一同质互动（homphilous）与异质互动（heterophllus）并评价他们在目的性行动中的效用。


## 4.3 Homophilous and Heterophilous Interactions

As explicated in the previous chapter, social interaction engages actors and thus intersects the resources embedded in the actors’ structural positions and social networks. The extent to which the intersecting resources are similar or different in quality, type, and amount may be considered

as variables ranging from identical to completely different. For simplic-ity’s sake, two types of interaction have been be identified and defined: homophilous and heterophilous. The former characterizes relations between two actors who have similar resources, which can include wealth, reputation, power, and lifestyle. The latter describes relations between two actors with dissimilar resources. As described in Chapter 3, homophilous interactions prevail, since the homophily principle links sentiment, interaction, and similarity of resources in actors’ reciprocal relationships.

While homophilous interaction has been much researched and examined, heterophilous interaction has received far less attention. The tendency has been to take heterophilous interaction as merely the opposite end of the continuum from homophilous interaction. Since there is a general tendency toward homophily in interaction, the logical deduction is that heterophilous interactions are less likely to occur. Given the hypothesized relationship between sentiments and interactions, the deduction has been that heterophilous interaction does not promote shared sentiment or that sentiment does not lead to heterophilous interaction.

Furthermore, heterophilous interactions demand effort, as the interacting partners, aware of the inequality in differential command over resources that can be brought to bear, need to assess each other’s willingness to engage in exchange. The resource-poorer partner needs to be concerned about alter’s intention or ability to appropriate resources from them. And the resource-richer partner needs to consider whether alters can reciprocate with resources meaningful to their already rich repertoire of resources. Thus, both partners in a heterophilous interaction have to make a greater effort in forging the interaction than those in a homophilous interaction. Heterophilous interactions therefore are relatively less likely to occur.

If this analysis is correct, one would also expect that when heterophilous interaction does occur, it requires more effort, probably at a greater cost, because of resource differentials and lack of shared sentiments. If homophilous interaction is the normative and ordinary interaction, then heterophilous interaction represents nonnormative and extraordinary interaction. What, then, motivates heterophilous interaction?


同质性互动与异质性互动

正如前一章所阐述的，社会互动需要行动者参与，并相互交换嵌入在行动者的结构位置和社会网络中的资源。相互交又的资源在质量、类型和数量上相似或相异的程度，可以考虑作为从相同到完全不同而变化的变量。为简单起见，我们已经将互动区分和界定为两类：同质互动与异质互动。前者以拥有相似资源一可以包括财富、声望、权力和生活方式的两个行动者之间的关系为特征。后者描述的是拥有不同资源的两个行动者之间的关系。如第三章所闻述的，同质性互动居于主要地位，因为在行动者的相互关系中，同质原则把情感、互动与资源的相似性联系在起

关于同质性互动的研究与讨论已经非常多了，但是人们很少关注异质性互动。结果，异质性互动只是作为连续统中同质性互动的另一极端。既然互动中已经存在同质交往的一般趋，根据逻辑演绎，自然是异质性互动很少发生。考虑到情感与互动之间的关系假设，推出的结论是，异质性互动不能促进情感分享或者情感不能导致异质性互动。

而且，异质性互动要求付出努力，因为互动参与者意识到，行动者对资源运用的控制是不相等的、存在差异的，需要评估每人参与交换的意愿。资源贫乏的参与者需要考虑他人从自己身上抽取资源的意图与能力。资源丰富的参与者则需要考虑，他人是否能够给本来已经很丰富的资源库还有意义的资源回报。因此，在异质性互动中，参与双方都要比在同质性互动中付出更多的努力。所以异质性互动相对较少发生。

如果这个分析是正确的，我们也可以预测到，由于资源的差异与共享情感缺乏的故，异质性互动需要行动者付出更多的努力，可能是很大的代价。如果同质性互动是规范的、普通的互动，那么异质性互动代表着非规范的、特别的互动。那是什么驱使了异质性互动发生呢？

## 4.4 Action Guiding Interaction: Formation of Predictions 

One clue explaining motives for heterophilous interactions is provided by the finding already referred to, that individuals prefer to associate

with others with somewhat better social status. The prestige hypothesis (Laumann 1966) shows that preferred partners for interactions are those occupying slightly higher social statuses. Empirically, such behavior has been well documented as the prestige effect . The implication is that such interaction is expected to enhance the prestige of the less advantaged actors. But the enhancement remains unclear, even though the term prestige hypothesis suggests a halo effect: a higher-status individual’s prestige rubs off on the actor seen with him or her. Such a halo effect (e.g., being admired for knowing a movie star or a Nobel Prize winner) by itself does not represent a permanent gain, since termination of the interaction might also result in the loss of the halo. What needs to be considered, then, is what an interacting partner with more resources represents.

It should be obvious by now that the explanation to be offered is this: actors access social capital, through interactions, to promote purposive actions. Thus, the nature of embedded resources accessed in interactions becomes critical in the analysis of purposive actions and interaction patterns. This can be made clear by presenting the hypotheses in a typology of action and interaction, as shown in Table 4.1.

In this typology, the two motives for action are represented by two rows: maintaining resources or gaining resources. Two types of interaction relative to resources in the two columns are homophilous interactions, in which partners share similar resources, and heterophilous interactions, in which partners share dissimilar resources. Obviously, this is a simplification of many more gradations possible in reality, but it will serve for the purposes of our discussion here. Each cell represents the coupling of a particular purposive action and a particular type of interaction. Two variables can be used to describe each cell: how much effort is required for the interaction and how much return or payoff may result relative to the purposive action.

From the perspective of social interactions, the homophily principle points to the triangular relationships among sentiments, interactions, and shared resources. It provides a structural explanation for least-effort interactions; interactions tend to promote sentiment and shared resources and vice versa. It is expected, then, that the homophilous interaction is the preferred and more frequent type of interaction; the least-effort homophilous interaction should be the expected pervasive pattern of interactions observed.

The purpose of expressive action, therefore, is consistent with this pattern of interaction. This type of action is likely to result in ego’s seeking out other actors who have similar resources and a similar interest in maintaining and defending them. The more similar the partners’

resources, the more likely they will share an understanding and concern for maintaining or defending such resources. Empathy and common concern promote interaction. Furthermore, the more homophilous the interacting partners are in terms of resources, the more socially equal they are. Thus, there is less concern regarding the possible intention or ability of alter to appropriate resources from ego. The cost of guarding and defending resources is reduced. The return, relative to the motivation for action, is also expected to be better.

Defending one’s resources requires the sentiments and support of those who are in the same social groups or those who are in a similar position (e.g., class) in the hierarchical structure. In other words, action taken to protect and maintain resources is consistent with normative patterns of interaction. At the extreme, then, normative interactions sustain maintenance of resources among individuals without the need to stress the action component.

Gaining resources, on the other hand, implies a different type of interaction. It is argued that the action to gain resources is better served, in terms of return, if the actor engages in heterophilous interactions –

finding actors with dissimilar resources. In Chapter 3 it was pointed out that in macrostructures, social positions are characterized by the resources they control and manipulate. Interaction, then, represents not only the joining of two actors but also, much more important, the joining of two social positions that the actors occupy. Interacting with an actor who controlls more resources means interacting with a social position with more resources. A higher position in the hierarchical structure not only controls and manipulates more resources, but also has greater command and a better view of other positions in the structure. Access to such a position affords the possibility of borrowing that command or that view. If the resource an actor wants to gain is located in a social structure (e.g., in the hands of someone who occupies a position in that structure), then it follows that interacting with an alter who occupies a higher position in that hierarchy might have the benefit of finding that position (through alter’s better view of the structure) or of mobilizing alter’s commands for moving ego to link up with that position or even to occupy it.

Further, this benefit goes beyond the hierarchical structure in which alter holds an advantaged position. By the rules of compatibility and transferability across different hierarchical structures, alter may also exercise influence by providing information regarding other structural positions or by helping ego establish links to another actor in the structure where that actor holds an advantaged position, from which this third actor might exercise authority to help ego find resources or occupy a sought-after position.

While heterophilous interactions therefore may provide the social capital useful for attaining such a goal for an actor taking an instrumental action, the effort is more costly. That is, obtaining additional or better resources requires interacting, directly or indirectly, with actors in other (and better) positions so that more and better information or authority/influence may be obtained. It means seeking out actors in different social positions than ego’s. Two factors make such efforts more difficult. First, the homophily principle suggests that a normative tendency is for actors of similar resources to engage each other. Finding and engaging others of dissimilar resources represents extraordinary interactions requiring greater effort.

Second, it should be clear by now that heterophilous interaction, as described here, goes beyond simply the reversal of homophilous interaction. It is more than merely interaction between dissimilar actors. From an actor’s point of view, the payoff may come from interacting with another actor who is not only different but also has better resources.

Since actors occupy hierarchical positions in society, ego would need to interact with someone who not only possesses more highly valued resources but also, more importantly, occupies a higher hierarchical position. Thus, as shall be made more explicit in the next chapter, heterophilous interactions have better returns if the partner occupies a higher, not lower, hierarchical position relative to ego. In such asymmetric interactions, while an actor seeking more resources may have much to gain, the payoff for the other partner (alter) in the interaction poses a serious problem: What favor can ego return to alter, who has better resources? Or why should alter respond by offering its resources as social capital to ego? Asymmetric exchanges, as heterophilous interactions imply, require further articulation, a topic I will treat in Chapter 9. Suffice it to state here that heterophilous interactions are costly and unusual.

Heterophilous interaction occurs, therefore, despite the fact that it requires greater effort to reach out beyond one’s own social circles, and is more costly in commitments to reciprocity and the offer of one’s resources for the initiating actors. In short, instrumental action requires a greater degree of agency to overcome the normative homophilous pattern of interaction.

行动如何引导互动

我们可以用前面已经提到的一个理论来解释异质性互动动机：在某种程度上，个体更喜欢与高社会地位的人交往。声望假设（Laumann 1966）表明，受欢迎的互动参与者是那些占据稍高社会地位的人。这样的行为被经验地描述为声望效应。处于不利地位的行动者可以借此来提高自己的名誉。虽然声望假设指出了光环效应：高地位个体的声望会影响到被他或她的光环所笼罩的行动者，但是「提高」仍然不是很清楚。这样的光环效应（如因为认识一个电影明星或诺贝尔奖获得者而被羨慕）本身并不代表一个永久的获得，因为互动的终结可以导致光环的消失。那么我们需要考虑的是，拥有更多资源的互动参与者代表着什么。

到现在我们已经可以很凊楚地这样解释：为了增进目的性行动的效果，行动者通过互动获取社会资本。这样，在互动中获取的嵌入性资源的性质，变成了分析目的性行动和互动模式的关键。通过行动与互动的类型学方式来阐述这个假设会更清楚，如表 4.11 所示：

在这个分类体系中，行动动机有两种：维持资源或获得资源。在两栏中相对于资源的两类互动是同质性互动（参与者共享相似的资源）与异质性互动（参与者共享不相似的资源）。很明显，为了讨论的需要，这是一个简单化的分类，现实中可能存在着更多的类别。每一个单元代表着一种特定的目的性行动与一类特定的互动的搭配。两个变量可以用来描述每一个单元：互动中要求付出多少努力和相对于目的性行动会产生多少回报或报偿。

从社会互动的视角看，同质原则表明了情感、互动与共享资源间的三角关系。它提供了最易互动的一个结构性解释。互动常常增进情感和共享资源，反之亦然。可以想到，同质性互动是更受欢迎、更经常的互动类型，最易的同质性互动应该是期望观察到的普遍互动类型。

表达性行动的目的是与这类互动相一致的。这类行动可能导致自我寻找与其有相似资源，在维持和保护资源中有相似利益的其他行动者。参与者的资源越相似，他们越可能共享维持或保护这些资源的理解与关心。共鸣与共同的关心促进了互动。而且，互动参与者在资源方面越同质，他们越会出现社会平等。因此，他们很少关心他人有什么意图或者从自我抽取资源的能力。这样防护与保护资源的成本降低了，相对于行动动机的回报也有望更好

保护自己的资源，需要在相同的社会群体中或在相似的等级制结构位置上（如阶级）的人的情感与支持。换言之，保护和维持资源的行动与规范性的互动是一致的。在极端情况下，规范性互动支持个体中的资源维持，而不需要强调行动因素。

另一方面，获得资源意味着一种不同类型的互动。如果行动者参与异质性互动一一寻找非相似资源的行动者，获得资源的行动被认为是为了更好的回报。第三章已经指出，宏观结构中的社会位置以控制和操纵资源为特征互动代表的不仅是两个行动者，而且更重要的是两个行动者所占据的两个社会位置的互动。与一个控制更多资源的行动者互动，意味着与一个拥有更多资源的社会位置互动。在等级制结构中的一个更高的社会位置，不仅控制和操纵着更多的资源，而且对结构中的其他位置拥有更大的控制和更好的视野。接近这样的位置会带来借取控制或视野的可能性。如果行动者想获得的资源位于社会结构中（如在结构中某个位置的占据者的掌握之中），那么与等级制中更高位置占据者的互动，可能有利于找到那个位置（通过他人更好的结构视野），或有利于动员他人的控制力量使自我与那个位置相联系，甚至占据那个位置。

进而，这个好处可以超越掌握着优势位置的他人所处的等级制结构。根据不同等级制结构的兼容性与转移性规则，他人也可以施加影响，这可以通过提供关于其他结构位置的信息，或者通过帮助自我与结构中的另一行动者建立联系，这另一个行动者处于其所在结构中的优势位置，他可以利用其权威帮助自我找到资源或占据一个「吃香」的位置。

尽管异质性互动可以提供有用的社会资本，使从事工具性行动的行动者实现其目标，但是付出的代价很大。就是说，要获得额外的或更好的资源需要直接或间接地与其他（和更好的）位置的行动者互动，从而可能获得更多、更好的信息或权威 / 影响。这意味着要搜寻超越自我拥有的不同社会位置的行动者。两个因素使这样的奋斗更艰辛。首先，同质原则意味着规范性的倾向是拥有相似资源的行动者互相吸引。寻找和吸引那些拥有不相似资源的人代表着必须付出更大努力的特殊互动。

第二，到现在应该更清楚，这里描述的异质性互动超出了简单的同质性互动的反面含义。从一个行动者的视角看，报偿可能来自与另一个不仅拥有不同的、而且是拥有更好的资源的行动者的互动。既然行动者占据社会中的等级制位置，自我需要与不仅拥有更有价值的资源的而且更重要的是占据更高的等级制位置的行动者互动。下一章会更明确地阐述：如果参与者占据一个相对于自我更高的等级制位置，异质性互动会产生更好的回报。在这样不对称性的互动中，虽然寻找更多资源的行动者可能获得很多，但是互动中的另一个参与者（他人）的报偿却产生了个严重的问题：自我拿什么回报那拥有更好资源的他人？或者，为什么他人要向自我提供作为社会资本的资源来回应？正如异质性互动所暗示的，不对称交换需要进一步阐述，我将在第九章处理这个主题。这里能够充分说明的是异质性互动代价高不寻常。

尽管异质性互动需要付出更多的努力以超越自己的社会閉子，需要高代价的互惠承诺和提供搭桥人以资源，但它还是发生了。简言之，工具性行动需要更大程度的主动性来克服规范性的同质性互动。

## 4.5 Structural Constraint and Opportunity in Capitalization

The predictions based merely on action and interaction, as projected in Table 4.1, however, are tempered by necessary considerations of the structural positions and network locations the engaging actors occupy.

More specifically, without an appreciation of the hierarchical structure and its constraints, heterophilous interaction by itself would make a poor prediction of instrumental return. Consider a bank president, who occupies a high-level position in the local community and beyond and who socializes with other highly positioned actors, as the homophilous principle would predict. Interacting with others with similar resources reinforces his or her position in the hierarchy, as the expressive action intends. However, when the bank president engages in instrumental action, would he or she need to engage others with dissimilar resources, as the heterophilous principle would predict? If valued resources are transferrable (see Chapter 4 on the transactions in complex structures), then we would expect the bank president to interact with others who may have different types of resources (e.g., power rather than wealth) but who nevertheless occupy a similar position in the complex hierarchical structure of the community – a homophilous interaction.

Likewise, actors occupying the lowest level of positions are not expected to garner as much return from heterophilous interactions as higher-level actors. As the distribution of positions and occupants in the pyramidal structure dictates, they are much more likely to engage in homophilous interactions (i.e., there are more actors like themselves in the structure, so that the opportunity for homophilous interactions is higher) and to find it much more difficult to engage others with higher positions (i.e., they have much less to offer in return for favors by those in higher positions). Thus, heterophilous interactions are less likely to produce the greater returns in their instrumental actions, as expected from Table 4.1.

It is therefore important to incorporate this hierarchical/structural dimension. The predictions presented in Table 4.1 may hold in general, but probably not for those who occupy elite positions in the structure.

For them, heterophilous interactions offer no greater return than homophilous interactions if multiple hierarchies implicating different types of valued resources are to be treated simultaneously. Structure does provide opportunities for some and constraints for others.

结构性约束与资本化中的机会

如表 4.1 所给出的预测仅仅是建立在行动与互动的基础之上，这个预测调和了对行动者所占据的结构位置与网络位置的考虑。更明确地说，不重视等级制结构及其约束，异质性互动本身对工具性回报的预测力很差。不妨设想一位银行的董事长，他在地方以及更高级社区中占据着高层位置，如同质原则预测的那样，他会与其他高位置的行动者进行社交活动。这正合表达性行动的意图，与拥有相似资源的行动者的互动加强了他或她在等级制中的地位。但是，当银行董事长进行工具性行动时，他或她会像异质原则所预测的那样，需要与拥有不相似资源的行动者进行互动吗？如果有价值资源是可以转移的（参见第三章在复杂结构中的交易），那么我们预测银行董事长可能会与拥有不同类型资源的（权力而不是财富），但是仍然在社区的复杂等级制结构中占据相似位置的行动者互动一同质性互动

同样，占据最底层位置的行动者，不期望从异质性互动中获得与高层行动者同样多的回报。由于金字塔结构中的位置和占据者分布的约束，他们更可能进行同质性互动（例如，在结构中存在更多像他们一样的行动者，因此同质性互动的机会更大），他们也发现与高位置的行动者进行互动很困难（例如，他们只能提供很少的东西来回报那些高位置行动者的恩惠）。异质性互动在工具性行动中不太可能产生更大的回报，这是与表 4.1 的预测所不同

因此，融人这个等级制的 / 结构性维度很重要。表 4.1 所提供的预测可能在通常情况下是适用的，但对于那些占据结构中精英位置的行动者可能不适用。对他们而言，如果含有不同类型的有价值资源的多个等级制被同时考虑，异质性互动并不会提供比同质性互动更少的回报。结构确实给一些人提供了机会，给另一些人制造了约束。

## 4.6 Concluding Remarks

This chapter, by specifying the motivations for action and the possible effort and return for such purposive actions in different types of interactions, and by bringing the action aspect and the structural aspect together, has set the stage for a formal presentation of a theory of social capital in the next chapter. Here we clarify the debate on action versus structure in the process of social capitalization: the process by which structural resources are turned into social capital. That is, does social capitalization represent purposive action on the part of the actor or does it simply reflect the structural opportunity present for an actor?

Classic capital theory and cultural capital theory (Bourdieu 1972/ 1977; Bourdieu and Passeron 1977) both see structural constraints or opportunities as decisive. Action is anticipated on the part of those in advantaged positions. For Bourdieu, the structural imposition is reflected in the dominant class’s socializing other members of the society (e.g., through education) with the elite’s values and norms, so that these others misrecognize the values and norms as their own. Individuals do use strategies of action to adopt and attain these values and norms, but such adaptation and action merely serve to reinforce the structural reproduction of the system that privileges the already dominant.

For most human capital theorists as well as some social capital theorists, the purposive action initiated by the actor seems to be the driving force behind the investment and mobilization of resources as capital.

Actors’ purposive actions may be constrained by their structural positions or network locations, but in this conception, even occupants of advantaged positions and locations cannot benefit from their positions/locations unless they initiate action to bring about desired results.

For Coleman, social capital is defined by the function it serves for a particular purpose and a particular actor (Coleman 1990, Chap. 12). If something embedded in the structure works for an individual for a particular action, then it is social capital. The same thing in another action and for another actor would not necessarily be social capital, as it may not serve the function. The concept has also been extended by Putnam (1993, 1995a, 1995b) and others to refer to participation in voluntary organizations, social clubs, and social groups, as it reflects trust in social institutions (Hardin 1998) and may be linked to the well-being of the society.

Granovetter (1974) points to the process of gaining information advantages through weaker ties and bridges. He does not specifically argue that actors are conscious of this advantage, or that they make efforts to use weaker ties or bridges. However, since normatively more frequent interactions tend to occur within one’s own social circle (among persons with stronger ties), the implicit suggestion is that the use of weaker ties or bridges represents extraordinary effort – thus, purposive actions.

Burt’s (1992) theory of structural holes says nothing about action. Yet, central to the utility of structural holes is an actor’s calculation of profit, which is a joint function (multiplication) of investment and the「rate of return,」as represented by structural opportunities. Burt analyzes structural opportunities in terms of structural holes and structural autonomy, expecting those with structural opportunities to take advantage of these resources and capital by taking action (investing) to generate a profit.

Thus, for Burt, active manipulation of resources by the actor is assumed.

In fact, he prefers the term players to actors to emphasize this point.

While these theorists hint at the action aspect, it remains implicit in their theories rather than being the focal point or the driving element.

The theory of social capital offered here and elsewhere makes this action aspect more explicit (Lin 1982). From the resource perspective, action is important and is given equal significance relative to structure. Motivated action guides interactions. Instrumental action, in particular, motivates investing – seeking out and mobilizing – in relations and connections that may provide access to social resources. Making explicit the hints of purposive action suggested by Granovetter and Burt, the theory of social capital gives primacy to the propensity to act in order to gain access and mobilize better social resources. However, the effort at investment and mobilization is constrained by the extent of resources’ availability and heterogeneity in the social structures in which actors find themselves.

Actors are further constrained by their particular position in hierarchical structures and their location in the network. Given existing social structures, this constraint looms as large and significant. Thus, in any empirical study, structural effects must not be ignored or underestimated.

In causal terms, however, it would be impossible to tease out the sequence in which either action or structure more significantly dictates access to social capital. Chapter 8 will propose the theoretical possibility that it is action that leads to social structures through the mobilization of social resources or social capital.

One puzzle that needs to be dealt with is how individual actors can use resources in the social structures for their own benefit rather than for the benefit of the social structures. As mentioned before, actors, as agents in social structures, are expected to take actions to maintain and promote the structural resources. How, then, can actors/occupants appropriate such positional resources for their own interests instead?

In general, social structure and individual actors reinforce each other: the structure rewards individual actors who support and recognize its valued resources, and individual actors strive to recognize and promote structural resources in order to gain status or better positions in the structure. However, actors/agents, empowered to interpret rules and procedures and to mobilize resources in the social structure, can and will trigger structural changes (Sewell 1992). Variations in their perception and interpretation of rules, and in their assessment of resource availability and needs, differ among agents due to their different experiences in socialization or professionalization. These variations bring about changes within a social structure as well as in a new structure to which the rules and procedures of an existing structure are supposedly trans-posed (Sewell 1992).

Furthermore, resources considered valuable by the social structure and its agents are not entirely identical. As both the collectivity and individual actors as agents strive to promote their own interests, and as the collectivity empowers the agents to interpret the rules and procedures and to mobilize resources, individual actors have the opportunity to promote their own interests. One way to promote self-interest is to mobilize and manipulate resources entrusted to the positions that actors occupy. A second way is to use linkages to other positions and their occupants, and to mobilize and manipulate their resources as well. These issues, directly implicating social change, will be dealt with in Chapter 11.

It is these structurally empowered relationships among positions and embedded resources that offer opportunities for the actors/occupants –

the agents – to gain access to structural resources for their own interests.

That is, these structural opportunities become social capital of the actors/occupants.

这一章通过详细说明行动的动机以及这些目的性行动在不同类型的互动中的付出与回报，通过将行动方面与结构性方面放在一起，已经为下一章正式闻述社会资本理论打下了基础。这里我们澄清了社会资本化过程到底是行动还是结构的争论：结构资源如何转变为社会资本的过程。也即，社会资本化是否代表着行动者的目的性行动，或者它是否仅仅简单地反映了行动者面对的结构机会

经典资本理论和文化资本理论（Bourdieu,1972/1977 Bourdieu and ' asseron,197）都将结构性约東或机会视为决定性的。行动被那些处在优势位置的行动者所期待。对于布迪厄，结构性的强制反映出统治阶级用他们的价值和规范对社会的其他成员进行社会化（如通过教育），以使他们将这些价值和规范误识为他们自己的。个体的确使用行动策略接受与获得这些价值和规范，但是这些适应与行动只是强化了有利于当前统治者的体系的结构性再生产

对于大部分人力资本理论家和一些社会资本理论家，行动者实施的目的性行动似乎是作为资本的资源投资和资源动员后面的动力。行动者的目的性行动可能被他们的结构性位置和网络位置所约束，但是，即使是优势位置 position/ocation）的占据者也不能从他们的位置（position/ocation）上获益。他们必需对他们所想往的结果发起行动。

对于科尔曼来说，社会资本是根据它对一个特定目的和一个特定行动者所实现的功能来定义的（Coleman,1990, Chap12.)。如果嵌入在结构中的某物有助于个体的某种行动，那么它就是社会资本。相同的事物在另ー个行动中、对于另一个行动者不必然是社会资本，因为它可能没有发挥功能。这个思想已经被普特南（Putnam,1993,1995a,199）和其他学者拓展到自治组织、社会俱乐部和社会群体中的参与上，因为它反映了社会制度的信任（Hardin,1993），也可能与社会福利相联系

格拉诺维特（Granovetter,1974）指出了通过弱关系和桥梁获得信息优势的过程。他没有特别强调行动者对这个优势的知觉，或者他们努力地使用弱关系或桥梁。然而，因为规范上更经常的互动倾向于发生在自己的社会圈子内部（在强关系的人之间），这内含的暗示是弱关系或桥梁的使用代表着特别的努力也就是目的性行动。

伯特（Burt,1992）的结构洞理论没有谈到行动。然而，正如结构机会所意味的，结构洞的核心效用在于行动者的利润计算，这是投资与「回报率」的共同功能（增值）。伯特分析了有关结构洞与结构自主的结构性机会，他认为那些有结构性机会的行动者会采取行动（投资）来利用这些资源和资本获利。因此，伯特假定行动者在积极地控制资源。实际上，他喜欢用竟技者（player）代替行动者（actor），以强调这一点。

虽然这些理论家暗示着行动方面，但这只是隐含在他们的理论中，而不是理论的关注点或关键因素。本书的社会资本理论对行动的阐述更明晰详尽 Lin,1982)。从资源视角看，行动很重要，相对于结构具有同等意义。有动机的行动指导着互动。特别地，工具性行动在可获取资源的关系与联系中驱动着投资一搜寻与动员。要详述格拉诺维特和伯特所暗示的目的性行动的含意，社会资本理论首先关注的是获取和动员好的社会资源的行动。然而，投资和动员的努力被资源在社会结构中ー行动者在这里寻找资源一一的可获取性和异质性的程度所约。行动者进一步被等级制结构和网络中的特定位置（position/location）所约束。考虑到现存的社会结构，这个约束显得很突出。因此，在任何经验研究中，结构效应决不能被忽视或低估。在因果分析上不可能理出行动和结构在获取社会资本时哪个比较重要。第八章将会提出理论尝试：行动通过动员社会资源或资本而导致社会结构的生成

需要解决的一个困惑是，个体行动者如何能够为了自己的而不是社会结构的利益而使用社会结构中的资源。前面已经提到，行动者作为社会结构的代理人，被期待着采取行动来维持和增进结构性资源。然而，为什么行动者 / 占据者实际上是为了自己的利益而抽取这些位置资源呢？

通常，社会结构与个体行动者是互相强化的：结构对支持与承认它的资

源价值的个体行动者进行回报；个体行动者为了获得结构中的地位或更好的位置，尽力地承认与增进结构的资源。然而，被授予权力解释规则和程序动员资源的行动者 / 代理人，能够而且将会引起结构变迁（Sewell,1992)。对规则的认识和理解，以及对资源的可利用性和需求的估计差异，在代理人中由于社会化或专业化经验的不同而不同。这些差异可以导致社会结构内部的变迁，还可以导致现行结构的规则和程序发生转型，使新的结构得以产生（Sewell, 1992

而且，社会结构及其代理人所认为的有价值的资源并不完全相同。当集体和作为代理人的行动者都尽力増进自己的利益时，当集体授权给代理人解释规则和程序以及动员资源时，个体行动者就有机会实现他们自己的利益。实现自我利益的一个途径是动员和控制行动者占据的位置所委托的资源。另个途径是利用与其他位置及其代理人的联系，也动员和控制他们的资源。这些直接涉及到社会变迁的问题将在第十一章解决。

这些位置与嵌入性资源之中的结构性的授权关系，为行动者 / 占据者 （代理人）提供了机会，使他们可以为了自己的利益而利用结构性资源。也即，这些结构性机会成为了行动者 / 占据者的社会资本。
