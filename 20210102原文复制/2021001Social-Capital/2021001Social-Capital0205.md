# Cybernetworks and the Global Village

The Rise of Social Capital

One recent controversy in the study of social capital has been an issue raised by Putnam (1993, 1995a, 1995b): whether social capital has been on the decline in the United States for the past three or four decades.

Putnam argues that there should be a positive association between social capital and political participation, and he measures social capital in terms of participation rates in social associations or secondary/tertiary associations such as PTAs, Red Cross associations, unions, church-affiliated groups, sports groups, and bowling leagues. Political participation is indicated by voting, writing to Congress, participating in rallies and political meetings, and so on. Putnam has observed that both participation rates have declined in the United States over the past thirty years or so. This has led him to conclude that social capital or civic engagement has been on the decline, and this decline might be responsible for a decline in democratic and political participation. Further, he suggests that the culprit may be the rise of television viewing. As television has gained popularity, the younger generations of Americans are no longer interested in participating in civil associations. Indeed, he suggests, even when they go bowling, they may bowl as individuals rather than as groups or leagues.

Putnam’s thesis and research have been challenged from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives. These challenges fault Putnam’s work primarily on two grounds. First, he committed errors in measuring social capital. For example, it has been pointed out that he erred in the analyses of the General Social Survey data (Greeley 1997a); he should have used「amount of time dedicated to voluntary work」

(Greeley 1997b, 1997c; Newton 1997) rather than mere membership in certain organizations; he excluded certain types of associations (especially organizations emerging in contemporary America [Schudson 1996; Greeley 1997a, 1997b, 1997c; Minkoff 1997; Newton 1997]); and membership in an association is not the same as civic-mindedness or civic 210

energy (Schudson 1996). Second, assuming that his measurements of social capital were acceptable, Putnam blamed the wrong culprit; other factors have been more critical than television viewing (Schudson 1996; Skocpol 1996).1

Whether social capital is rising or declining largely depends on how it is defined and measured (Greeley 1997b; Portes 1998; Lin 1999a). In addition, its significance lies in the consequences selected for analysis.

When it is measured using multiple concepts such as memberships, norms, and trust, there is a danger of confusing a causal proposition (e.g., networks promote trust or vice versa) with multiple indicators of the same thing (networks, trust, and norms all measure social capital).

When it is applied to a collectivity as well as to individuals, there is also a danger of the ecological fallacy (e.g., conclusions drawn from one level are assumed to be valid for another).

Following the theory proposed in this volume, I argue that social capital should be measured as embedded resources in social networks.

This definition ensures consistency in the measurement and in theory as originally conceived (Bourdieu, Coleman, Lin). It also demands and allows macrophenomena to be examined for the processes and mechanisms by which social capital, thus defined and measured, is invested and mobilized to achieve certain goals at the community or societal level.

From this perspective, then, the debate on whether social capital has been declining or rising in the United States or any society remains to be demonstrated and verified, as none of the studies carried out so far clearly employ the notion that social capital is reflected in the investment and mobilization of embedded resources in social networks. Membership in associations or social trust may or may not be adequate surrogate measures of social capital; their linkage or association with social capital must be clearly demonstrated before any meaningful debate can proceed.

By focusing the definition and measurement of social capital on embedded resources in networks, I will argue in this chapter that there is clear evidence that social capital has been on the ascent in the past decade – in the form of networks in cyberspace (Lin 1999a). Further, this ascent has consequences beyond community or national boundaries. The 1 There is substantial literature blaming Putnam for using the wrong dependent variable (e.g., importance of good government: Skocpol 1996; the importance of political organizations: Valelly 1996; the importance of national community: Brinkley 1996; the importance of inequality in political participation: Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995, 1997; the importance of national elites: Heying 1997; the importance of political institutions: Berman 1997; the importance of institutional incentives: Kenworthy 1997; the importance of culture: Wood 1997). This literature does not address issues directly related to social capital.

hypotheses advanced here are two: (1) social capital in the form of cybernetworks is clearly on the rise in many parts of the world, and (2) the rise of cybernetworks transcends national or local community boundaries; therefore, its consequences (both positive and negative) must be assessed in the global context. I begin with a broad survey of the emergence of cybernetworks and the time- and space-transcending social capital they offer.

The Internet and Cybernetworks:

Emerging Social Capital

Cybernetworks are defined as the social networks in cyberspace, and specifically on the Internet .2 These networks are constructed by individuals and groups of individuals – through e-mail, chat rooms, news groups, and clubs (Jones 1997b; Smith and Kollock 1999) – as well as by informal and formal (e.g., economic, political, religious, media) organizations for the purpose of exchanges, including resource transactions and relations reinforcement. Cybernetworks have become a major avenue of communication globally since the early 1990s; an overview of their extent and scope is informative here.

Since late the 1970s and early 1980s, personal computers (PCs) have penetrated workplaces and homes around the globe. Their presence and pervasiveness have overtaken many other communication commodities in North America, Europe, and East Asian countries. In 1997, U.S. consumers bought more computers than automobiles, according to Steven Landefeld, director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( USA Today , March 17, 1999). Worldwide PC sales has overtaken television sales in 2000, according to Paul Otellini of the Intel Architecture Business Group (Intel Developer Forum, February 25, 1999). In fact, PC sales already outnumbered sales of TV sets in 1998 in Australia, Canada, Denmark, and Korea. In 1999, 50 percent of U.S. households had computers, and 33 percent were online (Metcalfe 1999).

E-commerce has become big business (Irving 1995, 1998, 1999). In 1998, online shopping orders totaled `$13` billion (with an average order amount of `$55`), and it was projected to reach `$30` to `$40` billion in 1999

(the Boston Consulting Group, as quoted in PC Magazine , March 9, 1999, p. 9). The greatest growth is expected in travel (88 percent in 1999

over 1998), PC hardware (46 percent), books (75 percent), groceries (137 percent), music (108 percent), and videos (109 percent) (Jupiter Communication, as quoted in PC Magazine , March 9, 1999, p. 10). It 2 A portion of this section is taken from Lin (1999a).

Cybernetworks and the Global Village 213

has been estimated that 24 million U.S. adults plan to buy gifts online in 1999, or almost quadruple the 7.8 million who said they bought gifts online in 1998; online holiday shopping alone in 1999 could exceed `$13`

billion (International Communications Research, as quoted in PC Week , March 1, 1999, p. 6). During 1999, Internet commerce, which is growing thirty times faster than most world economies, will reach `$68` billion (Metcalfe 1999, quoting International Data Corp.). By the year 2002, the projection is that online shopping will account for `$32` billion in convenience items such as books and flowers, `$56` billion in researched purchases like travel and computers, and `$19` billion in replenishment goods such as groceries (Forrester Research Inc., as quoted in PC Week , January 4, 1999, p. 25). Another projection suggests that 40 percent of Web users will be online buyers by 2002, resulting in `$400` billion in e-commerce transactions (International Data Corporation, as quoted in ZDNet Radar, Jesse Berst,「Technology of Tomorrow,」January 6, 1999). In the first half of 1998, one out of every five retail stock trades occurred online. There are now an estimated 4.3 million people shopping for stocks and funds online, and online trading is expected to reach 31 percent of the total U.S. investment market by 2003 (Wilson 1999, quoting Piper Jaffray, PC Computing , March 1999, p. 14).

On March 16, 1999, the U.S. Commerce Department scrapped a sixty-year-old industry classification system that had little relevance to an information-based economy ( USA Today , March 17, 1999, p. A1). For example, computers had not even been an industry category; they were grouped with adding machines. A new system was installed that better reflected the new categories created by the information revolution. The system is also designed to be similar to those in Mexico and Canada as trade with those countries continues to grow ( USA Today , March 17, 1999, p. A1). Further, the Commerce Department will begin publishing figures that show the impact of online shopping on retail activity, a key indicator of the nation’s economic health. Until now, the Commerce Department has lumped online shopping figures together with catalogue sales in its overall retail sales numbers. New figures that break out Internet sales as a separate entity will be available by the middle of 2000 for 1998 and 1999 ( Info World , February 15, 1999, p. 71).

Use of the Internet for communications and networking has been more recent but even more phenomenal in growth than PCs themselves. Since the invention of the hypertext technique by Tim Berners-Lee in the 1980s at CERN (the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland) and the introduction of the World Wide Web to the Internet in the summer of 1991, Internet growth in the past decade has been nothing short of revolutionary. In 1995, 14.1 million of 32 million U.S. households had modems, and by January 1999, 37.7 million of 50 million U.S.

households had modems ( USA Today , March 17, 1999, p. 9D). Worldwide, there were 68.7 million Web users in 1997 and 97.3 million in 1998, and the projection is that the number of Web users will exceed 300 million by 2001 (World Trade Organization estimate, March 12, 1998). Two-thirds of the people who will be online by 2002 were not online in early 1999 (Metcalfe 1999, quoting International Data Corp.).

More than 45 million PC users in the United States accessed the Internet regularly in early 1998, a 43 percent increase in the first quarter of 1998 versus the first quarter of 1997. Nearly 49 percent of all U.S. households had at least one PC ( ZD Market Intelligence , January, 1999). In 1999, for the first time, most users – 51 percent – lived outside the United States (Metcalfe 1999, quoting International Data Corp.). The number of Internet users in China surged to 1.5 million in 1998 from 600,000

in 1997 (Xinhua News Agency, January 15, 1999). There were report-edly 4 million Internet users in China in 1999. U.S. Internet guru Nicholas Negroponte predicted in January 1999 that the number of Internet users in China would balloon to 10 million by the year 2000

(Reuters, January 15, 1999).

Female participation on the Internet has also increased dramatically.

In January 1996, only 18 percent of Net users aged eighteen or above were female; by January 1999, fully 50 percent of the users were female ( USA Today , March 17, 1999, p. 9D). By the end of the year, it was expected that women will become the majority of users on the Internet (Metcalfe 1999, quoting International Data Corp.). In 1997, more e-mail was sent than letters via the post office for the first time.

PC experts have announced, to no one’s surprise, that the Internet is changing everything. Michael J. Miller, editor-in-chief of PC Magazine, wrote in February 1999 that the Internet changes「the ways we com-municate, get information, entertain ourselves, and run our businesses」

( PC Magazine , February 2, 1999, p. 4). In January 1999, Paul Somerson stated the same thing in PC Computing . It is practically impossible to get a credible estimate of how many discussion groups, forums, and clubs of multiple types have been formed and are continually being formed. What is the implication of cyberspace and cybernetwork growth for the studies of social networks and social capital? The short answer is: incredible.

In view of the dramatic growth of cybernetworks, a fundamental question can be raised: do cybernetworks carry social capital? If so, there is strong evidence either that the recent argument that social capital has been on the decline is false or that the decline has been arrested. I suggest that indeed we are witnessing a revolutionary rise of social capital , as represented by cybernetworks. In fact, we are witnessing a new era in

Cybernetworks and the Global Village 215

which social capital will soon supersede personal capital in significance and effect.

Cybernetworks provide social capital in the sense that they carry resources that go beyond mere information purposes. E-commerce is a case in point. Many sites offer free information, but they carry adver-tisements presumably enticing the user to purchase certain merchandise or services. They also provide incentives to motivate users to take actions. The Internet has also provided avenues for exchanges and possible formation of collectivities (Fernback 1997; Jones 1997b; Watson 1997) These「virtual」connections allow users to connect with others with few time or space constraints. Access to information in conjunction with interactive facilities makes cybernetworks not only rich in social capital, but also an important investment for participants’ purposive actions in both the production and consumption markets.

Just as pertinent is the debate on whether globalization of cybernetworks represents a reproduction of the world system where the core states or actors continue to dominate and indeed「colonize」peripheral states/

actors by incorporating the latter into global economic systems dominated by the former (Brecher and Costello 1998; Browne and Fishwick 1998; Sassen and Appiah 1998). This argument is supported by evidence that international organizations, international corporations, and international economic forms, such as commodity chains, are dominated by the values, culture, and authority of dominant states’ corporations or by these states themselves. There is much concern about the increasing inequality of access to cyberspace around the world. As the rich countries and actors gain greater access to capital in cyberspace, the poor countries and actors are largely shut out from the cybercommunity.

Yet, cybernetworks suggest, at least for those who gain access to cyberspace, the possibility of a bottom-up globalization process whereby entrepreneurship and group formations become viable without the dominance of any particular class of actors (Wellman 1998). Do cybernetworks suggest a neo-globalization process? While not denying that the dominant states and actors remain actively interested in controlling the development of cyberspace, I argue that cybernetworks represent a new era of democratic and entrepreneur networks and relations in which resources flow and are shared by a large number of participants with new rules and practices, many of which are devoid of colonial intent or capability.

With the increasing availability of inexpensive devices and ever-increasing Web capabilities that transcend space and time, we are facing a new era of social networks in the form of global villages. Globalization of cybernetworks is a double-edged sword. More sharply than ever, it demarcates the haves and the have-nots in terms of accessing capital embedded in cyberspace. Access to computers, other devices, and the Internet remains distributed unequally because of social (e.g., lack of education and facility in the language), economic (e.g., ability to acquire computers and gain access to the communications infrastructure), and political (e.g., authoritarian control over access) constraints. Yet, within the cybernetworks, it is no longer necessary or possible to reproduce the core-peripheral world system, in which the core actors establish links and networks to peripheral actors for their continuing domination of information, resources, and surplus values. Instead, information is freer and more available to more individuals than ever before in human history. It is also clear that constraints and control over access are waning fast as computer and communication costs decrease and technology leapfrogs the traditional authoritarian control of access.

There is strong evidence that an increasing number of individuals are engaged in this new form of social networks and relations, and there is little doubt that a significant part of the activities involve the creation and use of social capital. Access to free sources of information, data, and other actors has created growing networks and social capital at an unprecedented pace. Networks are expansive and yet at the same time intimate. Networking transcends time (connecting whenever one can and wants to) and space (accessing sites around the globe directly or indirectly if direct access is denied). Rules and practices are being formulated as such networks are constructed. Institutions – borrowed from past practices, deliberately deviating from past practices, or consensually developed by participants – are being created as such networks (e.g., villages) are being built.

There is little doubt that the hypothesis that social capital is declining can be refuted if one goes beyond the traditional interpersonal networks and analyzes the cybernetworks that emerged in the 1990s. We are witnessing the beginning of a new era in which social capital is far outpacing personal capital in significance and effect. We need to compile basic data and information on the extent to which individuals are spending time and effort engaging others over cybernetworks, compared to the use of time and effort for interpersonal communications, other leisure activities (TV watching, travel, eating out, movie- and theatergoing), attend-ing civic and local meetings, and so on. We also need to estimate the amount of useful information gathered through cybernetworks compared to traditional media.

In the next section, I will offer a case study, concerning the recent Falun Gong movement in China, as an example of how cybernetworks provide social capital in a social movement and sustain collective action even within an extremely constrained institutional field. This example shows

how cybernetworks facilitate the use of social capital over space and time, and demonstrates effectiveness in generating and sustaining a social movement in a global context. Whether the movement itself has any merit is of no interest here.

Falun Gong: A Case Study of Social Capital

and Social Movement

Falun Gong (Cultivation of the Wheel of the Law), also known as Falu Dafa (the Great Law of the Wheel), is a Chinese meditation and exercise technique proposed by Li Hongzhi (Li 1993). Li contends that it evolved out of Buddhism and captures the truth of the universe through both Buddhism and Taoism, the two highest-level religions in the world.

According to Li, the principle of the universe is contained in a turning Wheel that, upon cultivation, can be contained in the lower abdomen of the cultivator. The Law can be expressed in three principles: Zhen (truth or truthfulness), Shan (compassion, kindness, or benevolence), and Ren (tolerance or forbearance). Practicing these principles helps the individual acquire the Wheel and keep it turning. The Wheel may turn in either direction. When it is turning clockwise, it brings the principles of the universe into the body as energy; when it is turning counterclockwise, it projects the principles outward to share the energy with others. Not everyone, in fact seldom anyone, acquires such energy at its powerful maximum, but most people can learn to keep the Wheel turning. As cultivation advances, more wheels can be built in the body from the root Wheel at the lower abdomen.3

3 Li was born in 1951, in a city in Jinlin Province, in northeastern China. According to Li, he was born on May 13, 1951 (Li 1994, p. 333), but the government has claimed that he changed the original date of birth on his official registration card from July 7, 1952 (www.peopledaily.com.cn/item/flg/news/072306.html) to May 13 in order to have it coincide, by the lunar calendar, with the birth day of Sakyamuni, or Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, on April 8). Li has contended that the original record was incorrect, and he has no interest in becoming a modern-day Sakyamuni. From 1970

to 1978, he worked at an army stud farm and played the trumpet in a forest police unit in Jilin, and worked as an attendant at a hotel run by the police unit. In 1982, after leaving the army, he worked at the security department of the Changchun Cereals Company ( People’s Daily , July 22, 1999). In 1991 he quit that job and became involved in the practice and instruction of qigong (cultivation of inner energy, a general and popular term for many forms of Chinese exercise to enhance inner energy).

According to the biography attached to one of the books he wrote (Li 1994), he started learning the Law from a master between the ages of four and twelve. He learned the principles of Zhen, Shan, and Ren and achieved the highest level of cultivation when he was eight, at which time he allegedly could become invisible, pull rusted nails from frozen pipes without effort, float off the ground, and penetrate through walls. He then met another master at the age of twelve and learned martial arts. In 1972, he met a third master who taught him to cultivate his mind for two years. The next master was a woman

The Falun Gong Organization

Li started propagating Falun Gong in 1992 in his native region of Changchung, Jinling, and then moved to Beijing and other cities throughout China. He charged no fees and claimed that all his income from workshops was donated to furthering the Falun Gong. Falun Gong spread quickly, and Li’s workshops and lectures drew huge audiences.

He found the Falun Dafa Research Society in Beijing, and his lectures were compiled into volumes.4 Over the next two years, an informal yet rigid structure emerged (Li 1996, pp. 132–133). The Society served as the highest national coordinating office under his direct command. In various provinces, regions, and cities, general teaching/assisting centers ( fudao zhong zhan ) were established. According to the Chinese government report, there were thirty-nine of them by July 1999 ( People’s Daily , July 30, 1999), each led by a coordinator appointed by Li and the Society (Li 1996, p. 135). These centers, in turn, coordinated teaching stations (1,900, according to the government report) scattered throughout cities and townships and, under these stations, cultivation or exercise spots or sites (28,000, according to the government report). In most cases, the coordinator had to participate in workshops conducted by Li himself, and no one else was allowed to conduct workshops (Li 1996, p. 144).

At each exercise site ( niengong dian ), there were tutors ( fudaoyuan ) and practitioners. Practitioners gathered at each site regularly to cultivate, or perform exercises and study Li’s writings and lectures (from audio- and videotapes) (Li 1996, pp. 144–145, 148). Centers, stations, and sites could cooperate (p. 150) and lean on ( guakau , or affiliated with) local work units (1996, p. 152).5 However, their leaders could not also par-who taught him the principles of Buddhism. In this fashion, he continued encountering new Buddhist or Taoist masters as he elevated himself to higher levels. He then began teaching others. After observing and studying various forms of qigong , he decided in 1984 to popularize his teachings by writing and editing his lectures. During this process, amazingly, all fourteen of his masters returned to help and instruct him. The Wheel of Law method, Falun Gong, was finalized in 1989. He spent the next two years observing how his disciples followed these instructions and elevated themselves to high levels.

However, according to official reports ( People’s Daily , July 22, 1999), Li did not begin learning qigong until 1988. He studied with two masters of qigong , mixing in some movements from Thai dance that he had learned while visiting Thailand.

In 1992, he「was ordered to go out of the mountain」(Li 1993, p. 112; 1994, p. 341) and started general training and lecturing throughout China.

4 As of April 1999, The Falun Dafa Web site listed fourteen volumes, which are mostly compilations of Li’s lectures (falundafa.ca/works/eng/mgjf/mgjf4.html).

5 For example, a site could「borrow」the yard of a work unit. Centers could be listed as affiliated with various work units for administrative reporting purposes, because voluntary or civic groups or associations, even professional associations, do not carry official administrative status and must「lean on」(be officially affiliated with) a work unit to gain recognition by the government.

ticipate in other forms of cultivation (e.g., qigong, or energy cultivation) or other groups and associations, and the stations and points could not participate in other associations’ activities, except in exhibitions and

「athletic event」demonstrations.

Thus, despite his persistent claim that Falun Gong or Dafa had no organization, Li had created a hierarchical organization with powerful and efficient top-to-bottom control. This organization, built on social networks and under the direction of a single leader and ideology, created its own institutions and institutionalizing organizations (see Chapter 11) through which new members were recruited, trained, and placed in an ever-expanding labor market.

Li left China in 1995 and the Society, under his direct guidance, continued to play the role of national coordination (Li 1996, pp. 169–170).

However, he stressed that cultivation was more important than organization (p. 175), and leaders and practitioners were urged to learn his writings and lectures through thorough memorization (pp. 105, 138, 169). Since Li was the only one who could conduct workshops, the leaders and practitioners could only read, repeat, and discuss his「scrip-tures」( jinwen , or quotations from his books and lectures) together at each exercise site or on their own. Leaders were forbidden to freely interpret and extend his teachings (p. 171). Thus, Li remained the only authority in the hierarchical organization.

Li employed the same strategies in deploying and extending his organization globally. He began lecturing in the United States in 1996. In November 1996, the first international「experience sharing」meeting of Falun Gong was held in China, attended by practitioners from fourteen countries and regions. In 1998, the first North American「experience sharing」meeting was held in New York. Other meetings were held in Canada, Germany, Singapore, and Switzerland. Falun Gong has grown like wildfire throughout China, especially in cities since 1992, and has spread to North America, Australia, Asia, and Europe. By early 1999, Li claimed to have over 100 million practitioners worldwide. Some scholars have estimated the number of practitioners in China to range between 20 to 60 million; the Chinese government puts the number at around 2 million (Reuters, July 25, 1999).

The Suppression and the Protest Movement

As Falun Gong grew, it caught the attention of the Chinese media and government, first fascinating them with its claims of incredible feats of curing and supernatural powers and then alarming them by its hierarchical organization; enthusiastic, cohesive, disciplined practitioners; and enormous popularity. In June 1996 one of the largest newspapers in China, Guangming Daily , started criticizing Falun Gong, drawing strong responses from the practitioners. The responses further alarmed the government. In the same year, the government banned five Falun Gong books. In 1997, the Ministry of Security investigated Falun Gong for possible illegal religious activities but did not draw any conclusions. In July 1998, the Ministry designated Falun Gong as a devious religious sect and conducted investigations. The Ministry of Civil Affairs also conducted investigations. Practitioners responded vigorously by staging sit-ins at various official sites and buildings. Cultivation continued to flourish at many exercise sites, and Li’s writings and lectures were readily available in print, and on audio- and videotape. In fact, there was a growing industry in China and abroad in the production of Falun Gong–related publications and materials, without the awareness or approval of Li or his Research Society.

The final confrontation began with the publication of an article by He Zhuo-xiu, a scientist and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Science and Technology Review for Youth ( Qing Shao Nian Ke Ji Bao Nan ), a monthly publication issued by the Tianjin Normal University. In the article (issue 4, 1999), He challenged the claimed scientific basis of Falun Gong and warned that it might be harmful for youth to practice. This article drew immediate responses from Falun Gong followers in Tianjin, who visited the publishing office and demanded a retraction of the article and a public apology. Starting on April 20, the Falun Gong practitioners began a sit-in demonstration. The gathering drew 3,000 on April 22 and 6,300 on April 23 ( People’s Daily , July 23, 1999). Without satisfactory responses from the publisher, the Tianjin cultivators decided to appeal to the national government and CCP leaders in Beijing.

Practitioners began to converge on Zhongnanhai, the compound in central Beijing housing the core government and CCP leaders and their families, on the evening of April 24. On April 25, more than 10,000

Falun Gong practitioners from several provinces and cities6 gathered at Zhongnanhai.7 They held silent sit-ins outside the compound, demanded a meeting with Party leaders, submitted an appeal, and sought official approval of their activities. Two representatives met Lo Gan, secretary of the Political and Legal Commission of the Central Committee, as well as Zhu Rongji, who joined in the conversation, but no commitments 6 According to the official report ( People’s Daily , August 4, 1999), demonstrators came from Hebei, Liaoning, Beijing, Tianjin, Shangdong, Helongjiang, Anhui, and other locations.

7 The official estimate put the number of protesters at over 10,000. Other eyewitness reports estimated between 20,000 and 30,000 protesters. It was difficult to separate some bystanders from participants, and the police eventually blocked off the area except for through traffic, preventing other practitioners from joining in.

were received. At the urging of the police, they eventually scattered after 9 p.m.

This incident sent a shock wave through the CCP leadership, for it was probably the first time since the Party gained control of the country in 1949 that the Party and the government failed to receive any information beforehand that an unauthorized gathering of any reasonable size would take place. Furthermore, such a gathering took place at Zhongnanhai, the nerve center of control. The Party not only saw this as a failure of intelligence but also sensed a strong threat to its authority and immediately swung into action. Jiang Zemin apparently issued a directive that evening for immediate investigations. A thorough review of the intelligence apparatus followed, and a nationwide investigation of Falun Gong proceeded with haste and determination. Realizing that Falun Gong practitioners had penetrated many Party and government bureau-cracies, offices, and institutes; that the number of Falun Gong cultivators was considerable (some scholars estimate it to be up to 60 million in China – the same size as the CCP membership, even though the Falun Gong and Li claim to have over 100 million cultivators, most of whom reside in China); and that the Falun Gong was well organized, thoroughly disciplined, and quick to mobilize, the Communist leadership considered it a serious threat to the core political ideology, to the Party organization, and to the absolute command of the Party in all spheres of life (Central Committee Circular 19, July 19, 1999). Efficiently coordinated organization, extensive participation, and collective cohesion convinced the CCP leadership that Falun Gong constituted a serious threat to the Party’s ideological and organizational hold over the country.

Also stunning was the large number of Falun Gong practitioners in the Party’s most sensitive offices and work units.

The Party outlawed Falun Gong on July 19 and immediately began arresting coordinators and important trainers throughout China, searching and ransacking their homes, confiscating and destroying books and related materials, and conducting a major reeducation campaign to eradicate Falun Gong involvement in the Party and the government. The campaign had three phases: elevating learning, or a reindoctrination in Marxist ideology; educational transformation, or persuading those involved in Falun Gong to recognize and admit wrongdoings (involvement in the Falun Gong); and organizational treatment, or ridding work units and areas of all elements of Falun Gong. All Party apparatuses, including investigative and disciplinary units, propaganda, the united front, Communist youth, and united women’s groups were to be mobilized to unveil Li’s and Falun Gong’s activities and intents, and were to control all situations so as to accomplish「early discovery, early reporting, early control, and an early solution」in「defending social and polit-

ical stability」(Central Committee Circular, July 19, 1999). For the next month, sustained, all-out efforts were made to eliminate Falun Gong in China.8

Cybernetworks and Falun Gong

What is fascinating from our perspective is that these events provide a vivid and powerful demonstration, for the first time in history, of how cybernetworks were implicated in a major social movement and countermovement. Moreover, it is most interesting, but probably not surprising, that this happened in a society under the rigid and powerful political command of a single political party and ideology: China.

As soon as Li left China in 1995, an Internet system was created by Falun Gong (falundafa.ca; falundafa.org; falundafa.com) through which direct communication and interactions were established between Li, who now resided in the United States, and his followers throughout the world, including China. The Web site, called Minhui (roughly,「clear understanding」), was supplemented by an e-mail system. These systems sustained the efficiency of the organization at all levels (from the Research Society and general teaching centers all the way down to many exercise sites and individual practitioners). There were more than forty linked sites in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Germany, Russia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is not known how many PCs in China were linked to these sites, but no doubt the connections were massive. Several pieces of evidence support this assertion. Li’s site was originally identified as the Overseas Coordinating Office of the Falun Dafa Research Society. By 1997, exchanges over the networks were so rampant that the Unit had to issue a statement to rein in control.

This statement, issued on June 15, 1997, warned that cybernetworks had been used to include other religious ideologies or qigong (cultivation of inner energy, a common exercise in China) content; to insert materials not approved by Li and the Research Society, including personal interpretations and the marketing of products; and to include materials illegally. The statement reminded all users that any materials, conversation records, or correspondence not contained in Li’s public lectures or publications could not be included on the Internet, and materials to be sent through the Internet had to be checked by teaching centers’ coordinators in various countries and regions. It asked all users to report violations of these rules, via e-mail, to the Overseas Coordinating Office (www.falundafa.org/fldfbb/gg970615.htm).

8 The Party claimed that it was all right to practice Falun Gong as a qigong exercise. But in reality, all public Falun Gong practices were dispersed and not allowed.

On August 5, 1997, the Overseas Unit’s site (www.falundafa.org) was formally merged with the site of the China Falun Dafa Research Society, and it issued an Internet statement to overseas practitioners advocating the holding of various meetings, in various languages, to increase the voice of Dafa in media around the world; the selection and inclusions of Caucasian practitioners as trainers and facilitators of Caucasian practitioners’ participation; the spread of Li’s publications through translation and the Internet; and an organization of visiting groups to China to learn and practice Dafa (www.falundafa.org/fldfbb/tz970805.htm).

On August 8, 1998, the Research Society issued an Internet message to Falun research associations and teaching centers in all countries, indicating that the cybernetworks for Falun Gong had achieved, or almost achieved, total and comprehensive linkage with all teaching centers around the world, including those in China. In this notice (www.falundafa.org/fldfbb/setup c.htm), the Society expressed satisfaction at the use of the Internet to spread the true words of Li (his published and publicly stated works only), as well as the activities of associations and teaching centers around the world. However, due to the enormous increase in personal e-mail addresses, the Society had discovered the dissemination of information not related to Dafa or related to religions, unverified statements by Li, and even misinformation in the name of the various associations or the Research Society. Thus, it announced the establishment of a Bulletin Board that would carry Li’s instructions and the Research Society’s announcements, the content of which could be copied and forwarded. Other individualized content would be modified or eliminated from all sites. All「irrelevant」

sites would be notified and corrected through the Bulletin Board (www.falundafa.ca/fldfbb).

Thus, by the summer of 1998, the Research Society and Li had established a comprehensive cybernetwork linking all or most teaching centers, as well as many individual practitioners, and exercised control over the flow of content. The extent to which this cybernetwork played a critical role in the mobilization of practitioners from many provinces and cities to converge on Beijing and Zhongnanhai on April 25, 1999, remained unknown. The fact that the CCP and government intelligence apparatus, which penetrates deeply into every corner of Chinese society, had no prior knowledge about the movements of thousands of practitioners, many of whom took trains and buses, suggests that the cybernetworks with direct linkages and access to information from the Research Society (now run in the United States), and among the teaching centers, exercise sites, and individual Internet users, might have played a key role in dissemination of information about the upcoming sit-down demonstrations.

This suspicion was confirmed in part by Li himself. On May 2, 1999, in interviews with Chinese and foreign media in Australia, Li was asked how he kept in touch with the 1 billion practitioners around the world. He replied:「Not any direct channels, because as you found out that here was a conference and so I found out too. Why should I say that we all know what is happening anywhere? Everyone knows about the Internet; this thing is very convenient throughout the world. Wherever there is a meeting, it appears in the Internet and many regions around the world learn soon and I learn too. I really do not have any exchanges with them, not even telephone calls」(www.falundafa.org/fldfbb/tomedia/

tochinesemedia.html). When reporters asked Li how the practitioners knew to go to Zhongnanhai on April 25, if they were not organized, as Li claimed, he replied:「You all know about the Internet; they found out on the Internet. Also, the practitioners in different regions were friends and relayed this information to others」(www.falundafa.org/fldfbb/tomedia/

toenglishmedia.html). To deny having any organization might be true in the legal sense (the Falun Dafa Research Society had not registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs), but certainly there was every evidence that the Society, teaching centers, and exercise sites formed a hierarchical structure throughwhichinformationflowand authority were commanded.

Thus, we could not consider Li’s reply as valid. But the fact remained that the cybernetworks were well placed by then to be used by the organization to disseminate any information it wanted, and Li’s statement did not deny that the networks were involved in the mobilization process.

After the April 25 incident and the strong and shocking responses from the Party and the government, the use of the Internet between the Minhui Site and individual users was intensive and extensive. To facilitate the flow of information, the Minhui Site constructed a file, called News and Reports, to carry information from China through the Internet. For the month of June 1999, this file (www.falundafa.org/china) contained 156

messages (all but 14 messages were specifically dated), and at least half of them were identified as originating from inside China. The locations identified included Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shangdong, Nanchang, Weifang, Qingdao (Shangdong), Hebei, BenXi, Linyi (Shangdong), Shenyang, Dalian, Qiqihar, Shijiazhuang, Guangzhou, Qinghungdao, Daqing, Fuzhou, Tonghua, Zhengzhou, Jaingsu, Hangzhou, Fujian, Taiyuan, Weihai, Jiangshu Qidong, Wuhan, Harbin, Hubei (Xishui), Changsha, and others.

The extensive use of the Internet was again confirmed when the government shut down several Internet sites in China that provided free or paid e-mail services. For example, 263.net shut down more than 1,000,000 of its free e-mail addresses on July 22 for several days, and when it came back on, the service was greatly curtailed and monitored.

In the meantime, the Internet was used widely by the Party and the government to attack Li and Falun Gong. Extensive essays were written and transmitted over Web sites (e.g., People’s Daily , Xinhua Press, and many other Web-site links to the Chinese government and the media) to discredit Li (e.g., about his falsified birth date, his tax evasion, the lowly jobs he held, the brevity of his qigong education, and his possible connections with the Central Intelligence Agency). Other reports provided personal and eyewitness accounts of individuals being victimized by Falun Gong. Articles reported confessions and renunciations of Falun Gong practitioners, especially among Party members and cadres. Finally on July 29, 1999, a new Web site (www.ppflg.china.com.cn) was created by People’s Daily dedicated to「unveiling Falun Gong, for the Health and Life of the People.」It contained columns including「reporting and commenting, surveying and analyzing, comments from the people, tragic stories, selected letters, relevant websites, and messages from visitors.」

There were also reports that many of the Falun Gong Web sites experienced hacking (AP, July 31, 1999) and at least one attempt that appeared to originate from the Chinese national police bureau in Beijing.

Bob McWee, a Falun Gong practitioner and manager of a Web site, falunusa.net, uncovered the Internet address from which hacking was attempted on his machine, along with two telephone numbers in Beijing.

When the Associated Press called the numbers, the person who answered the phone identified them as belonging to the Public Security Ministry.

A telephone operator at the Ministry said they belonged to the Internet Monitoring Bureau.

It is clear that for the first time in history, a movement and a countermovement occurred in cyberspace, apparently with dramatic effect.

Discussion

The Falun Gong incident serves as a vivid contemporary illustration of how social networks and capital provide the mechanisms and processes by which an alternative ideology, challenging prevailing ideology and institutions (see Chapter 11), can be institutionalized. The Falun Gong incident was considered the most serious challenge to the CCP since the Tiananman Square incident in 1989 (Lin 1992b). However, there are significant differences between the two social movements. Falun Gong involved much broader participation, drawing practitioners from all age groups, all social and occupational strata, and both urban and rural populations (though probably disproportionately from cities and townships), as well as enjoying a well-organized and strongly hierarchical structure of command, and having the advantage of the Internet as well as cell phones (the Tiananmen Square participants could only use the newly

available fax machines effectively). While the Tiananman Square incident died down quickly after June 4, 1989, Falun Gong had the benefit of a cybernetwork that remained in operation after July 20, 1999, and in communication with some users inside China.

Falun Gong provided no political ideology in the traditional sense, but it did offer an alternative ideology to the prevailing ideology. The events of 1999 illustrate that social networks built on a singular alternative ideology can mobilize individuals into a cohesive collectivity. From this collectivity have emerged alternative institutionalizing organizations in the form of teaching centers and exercise sites where「cultivation」involves not only exercises and meditations, but, more importantly, reading and studying the ideology – Li’s teachings. These effective organizations provided the training ground for new recruits, indoctrinated them with the ideology, and absorbed them into the social networks. With the aid of the cybernetworks, these social networks have created revolutionary and powerful means to mobilize capital, social and others, making viable massive social movements even in a most constrained and repressive institutional field. The leaders of the prevailing ideology and institutions correctly recognized these challenges and considered them a serious political struggle. In the Central Committee’s circular banning Falun Dafa, the first point made was that Party members「must recognize the political nature and serious damage of the Falun Gong organization.」A subsequent essay recognized the Falun Gong organization’s serious challenge to the CCP’s guiding principles (Qiu Shi, 1999).

Li and his followers steadfastly denied that there was any organization ( zuzhi ), on the ground that they had no physical location, no visible hierarchy, and no visible leaders. But it was clear that Li had put together a most efficient organization, with sophisticated means of communication such as a cybernetwork, to recruit, train, retain, and mobilize followers and create collective social capital. It is doubtful that Li intended to challenge the sovereignty of the Communist Party in China, but the alternative ideology and institutions he created could have eroded the Party by winning over its members and penetrating its organizations, thus chipping away at its institutional capital and human capital to the extent that its effectiveness and capability for absolute one-party and one-ideology rule would have been seriously if not irretrievably damaged.

Research Agenda

The growth of cyberspace and the emergence of social, economic, and political networks in cyberspace signal a new era in the construction and

Cybernetworks and the Global Village 227

development of social capital. No longer is social capital constrained by time or space; cybernetworks open up the possibility of global reaches in social capital. Social ties can now transcend geopolitical boundaries, and exchanges can occur as fast and as willingly as the actors care to participate. These new developments provide new opportunities as well as challenges for accessing social capital, and thus alert us to reconsider theories and hypotheses on social capital that have so far been built largely on observations and analyses of localized, time-constrained social connections. Systematic research efforts must be made to understand and assess this new form of social capital. Here I offer several contradictions and challenges worthy of research attention.

1. How can we extend notions and theories of localized social capital to global social capital and to social capital captured in cybernetworks?

For example, what is a civil society in the global village? How can we extend our analysis of the contribution of social capital to national assets such as democratic society or political participation or to community assets such as trust and cohesion? What are the equivalent global assets?

Do we need to develop new notions, or can we apply the theories and methods we have developed to understand a global civic society or a global engagement? Even if we can make such extensions, which I doubt we can without modifications, how do we compare localized versus global social capital and their consequences? Are the traditional localized embedded resources losing their utility (e.g., local cohesion can no longer rely solely on localized social capital) or will they retain their returns for the local community? If these localized networks remain meaningful, what do cybernetworks mean in this context? How can national participation be seen as a component of this larger global context or village (Ananda Mitra 1997 in Jones 1997a)?9 Do cybernetworks represent added social capital or do they replace localized social capital? Does being a citizen of a community or a nation takes precedence over being a resident of a global village, or vice versa, and under what conditions? In cases of conflicting interests or loyalties for an actor in her or his access to localized and global social capital, how does the actor choose between the privileges and responsibilities of each?

2. In one sense, cybernetworks provide an equalizing opportunity in the access to social capital. Given the easy, low-cost access to cybernetworks that is being provided to more and more people around the world, the abundance and flow of information, the multiplicity of alternative channels as sources and partners, and the increasing need for and gratification of almost instantaneous exchanges, power differentials will 9 I use the term village to suggest that rules, practices, and institutions for cybernetworks are still largely in flux and are being developed.

inevitably suffer degradation. Multiple routes may mean less dependence on certain nodes and less power to these nodes. Will such alternative routes reduce the significance of network locations or bridges? Does this mean, then, that there will be an equalizing or democratization process in cybernetworks? Likewise, authority will become harder to exercise.

As the Falun Gong case demonstrates, social capital is now carried across time and space, and traditional authorities can no longer control and command resources, as before. Alternative and counterprevailing ideologies will not be so easily stamped out or suppressed.

This process has already appeared in the economic sector. For example, emerging companies like Dell and Gateway entered the Internet early, and by reducing transaction costs involving intermediaries and stockpiling of inventories, they sold computers faster and at a lower price. This has offered them a significant competitive advantage over traditional companies such as IBM, Compaq, and Hewlett Packard, which rely on third parties for sales and services. These companies will have to either switch or lose business and competition as they face the enormous task of maintaining the traditional way of doing business and adapting to new avenues to interact directly with buyers. In stock trading, electronic trading companies such as Charles Schwab, E-Trade, and Datek similarly allow individuals to trade at a lower cost and a faster transaction rate, forcing companies such as Merrill Lynch to adapt to the new rules, again at the risk of losing relations with their local and regional dealers. The pressure on traditional firms and industries is enormous.

Travel agencies, car dealers, insurance companies, banks, and stock-brokers all face the challenge of either changing fast in adopting cybernetworks to do business or facing death (Taylor and Jerome 1999). Such is the force of cybernetworks for equalizing power.

Yet, will power disappear? Hardly (Reid 1999). Resourceful actors in cyberspace will accrue more resources, make alliances, acquire or merge with other resourceful actors, and block off alternative routes with pro-prietary hardware and software to establish themselves as the essential bridges or structural holes in the cybernetworks. New rules and practices are being developed for firms to deal and take advantage of the information economy (Breslow 1997; Kelly 1998; Shapiro and Varian 1999). Microsoft is doing it by cornering operating systems and major applications. America Online is attempting to do it by blocking off access to its users from outside. Telephone companies, cable companies, and satellite firms are all competing or combining to gain a competitive edge over the Internet. Elite universities and research institutions have established their own supercomputing and Internet systems. Government and other agencies and firms will acquire extensive information on individuals and make such information available to actors and agents who have the power, authority, or wealth to pay for or gain access to such information. The federal Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, convened in June 1999, was to devise recommendations on e-commerce taxation policies. In April 2000, it recommended to Congress that the moratorium on the Internet tax be continued for six years.

At the same time, access to cyberspace itself has enlarged the gulf between the haves and the have-nots. The Internet, for example, may have equalizing effects for citizens of North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and East Asia, allowing them to acquire social capital.

Yet, it may also have further differentiated these societies and their citizens from the rest of the world, especially Africa. According to the 1999

International Data Corporation/World Times Information Society Index ( PC magazine June 8, 1999, p. 10), which tracked fifty-five countries that accounted for 97 percent of the global gross national product (GNP) and 99 percent of information technology expenditures, the information gap between rich and poor countries has continued to widen.10 About 150

countries representing 40 percent of the world’s population were not included in the Index; they accounted for 3 percent of the world GNP

and less than 0.5 percent of all information technology expenditures.

Without computers, linguistic facilities, and electricity and telephones, many citizens around the world have been excluded from accessing, participating in, and exchanging within cybernetworks.

The digital divide in social capital may also be further differentiating people along socioeconomic class, ethnic, religious, and residential lines.

In the United States, the top-ranked information economy in the world, inequality in access to computers and the Internet is substantial. In the 1999 report Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide , the U.S. Department of Commerce (Irving 1999) showed significant gaps in households with and without e-mail across income, urban-rural, race/

origin, education, and marital status categories. These gaps increased from 1994 to 1999. As can be seen in Figure 12.1, in 1999, 40 to 45

percent of U.S. households with incomes of more than $75,000 had access to e-mail, compared to only 4 to 6 percent of those with incomes of $14,999 or less. Figure 12.2 shows that over one-fifth (21.5 percent) of white households had access to e-mail, whereas less than 8 percent of black and Hispanic households did. Education (Figure 12.3) told the same story: Over two-fifths (38.3 percent) of the households with persons holding bachelor’s or higher degrees had access to e-mail, whereas less than 4 percent of those with some high school or less did.

10 The top ten countries in information technology expenditure were, in order, the United States, Sweden, Finland, Singapore, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Japan, and Canada.

Figure 12.1 Percentage of U.S. households with e-mail by income and by rural, urban, and central city areas. (From National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] and U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce, using November 1994 and December 1998 Current Population Surveys)

Regional divides (Figure 12.4) likewise showed inequality: residents in urban and central cities had much greater access to e-mail than rural households (except in the Northeast). Married couples (with no children or with children less than eighteen years old) were much more likely to have access to e-mail than other types of households (Figure 12.5).

The gaps between the rich and the poor, the urban and the rural, the educated and the uneducated, and the dominant ethnic/racial/religious groups versus others have undoubtedly become worse between developed and less developed countries. For example, in the United States, almost half of all Internet users are females, whereas in China, females

accounted for only 15 percent of Internet use in a recent survey (CNNIC

1999). About 60 percent of Chinese users were college educated (versus 38 percent of U.S. users).

Thus, ethnic and gender differences in Internet use (Poster 1998; Sassen 1998, Chaps. 5 and 9) and the level of the country’s technological development increase inequality (Castells 1998, Chap. 2), and are compounded by societal development. In other words, because technological capabilities and all forms of capital differ across nations, inequality in social capital is growing fast and further in cybernetworks. Social class differences in accessing social capital in cybernetworks may be diminishing in advantaged societies, yet they may be increasing in disadvantaged societies. Take language as an example: computers, the Internet, and communication around the globe are dominated by the English language, ranging from the development of codes to routine user

Figure 12.3 Percentage of U.S. households with e-mail by education, 1994 and 1998. (From National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] and U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce, using November 1994 and December 1998 Current Population Surveys)

commands. English-language countries, already advantaged through earlier industrial developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, have continued to gain an advantage through the growing capabilities of computers and the Internet. It is true that other countries, due to their large populations (e.g., China), may develop their own linguistic cybercommunities, but the language gap will continue to increase the inequality of social capital in cybernetworks. Analysis of inequality of social capital inevitably relies on the comparison of subunits such as nations, regions, or communities. In this sense, traditional communities and national boundaries will remain meaningful so long as gaps in social capital remain significant along these lines.

This divide involves more than the availability of technologies. As computers decrease in cost and satellite services begin to provide wide coverage around the world, the more demanding resources or the absence of capabilities to access cyberspace and cybernetworks such as

Figure 12.4 Percentage of U.S. households with e-mail by relation, by rural, urban, and central city areas, 1994 and 1998. (From National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] and U.S.

Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce, using November 1994

and December 1998 Current Population Surveys) education, linguistic facilities, and sociopolitical constraints will require far greater efforts and difficult changes.

3. The mixing of material and idea goods as social capital in cybernetworks is unprecedented. Information may be free, but the cost is exposure to imposed idea/material messages, especially commercial messages. While this cost is traditional, as it has been in printed media for centuries and in television for decades, the integration of economic and marketing messages in cybernetworks is much more thorough. There is no clear demarcation between senders and receivers of such mixed messages; all exchanges are potential (voluntary or involuntary) carriers of such messages. Although currently they are primarily commercial/

material in nature, they may extend to political, religious, and other

Figure 12.5 Percentage of U.S. households with e-mail by household type, 1994 and 1998. (From National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] and U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce, using November 1994 and December 1998 Current Population Surveys)

content/idea arenas. Thus, free information in cybernetworks may become increasingly「expensive.」Can technology to block out such unwanted messages keep up with the technology and political leverage to plant them?

4. Free access to and networking in cyberspace have blurred the boundary of social capital – the privilege of privacy (personal resources) and freedom to access information (social resources). Cyberspace has attained unprecedented freedom to transmit information. Privacy issues loom large, as the ability to seek and find information about others expands at a shocking rate (Burkhalter 1999; Donath 1999). For example, there is unprecedented access to pornography on the Internet

Cybernetworks and the Global Village 235

compared to traditional print and visual media. Transmission of hate messages (Zickmund 1997; Thomas 1999) and crime (Castells 1998, Chapter 3), as well as love or romance, has led to opportunities as well as tragedies (see Jeter 1999 for an account of an Internet romance ending in death).

Still more serious is the clash between freedom of information and privacy. The issue is no longer that of preventing children from gaining access to certain information; it concerns anyone’s right to gain access to information about anyone else. In the United States, for example, it is possible, at no cost or minimal cost, to gain access to digitized information about other people’s bank accounts, mortgage accounts, stock accounts, prison records, driving licenses and violations, substance abuse records, and much more information associated with the Social Security number. One person’s freedom to gain information may be the invasion of someone else’s privacy. Does social capital have a boundary, and if so, who sets the boundary? Unlike traditional social networks, where interpersonal relationships constrain the flow and content of shared resources, cybernetworks reduce such relationships and constraints to a minimum.

Freedom to provide information on the cybernetworks has also caused unprecedented sociolegal problems. When is something considered pornography by the community standard as the notion of community blurs? When is hate information sufficiently damaging to a group of individuals to be banned? When is violence advocated sufficiently to be considered as motivating or urging actions? Courts are involved, for example, in ruling on whether and to what extent information about certain social taboos can be propagated over the Internet (MacKinnon 1997; Morrow 1999). What legal actions are possible or necessary for planting false information for gains in the stock market (Jarvis 1999)?

When such messages are transmitted across community and national boundaries, who has the legal authority to regulate them? If legal entities such as national governments engage in cyberwars (e.g., hacking other governments’ data or sending hate or revolutionary messages), are international organizations capable of mediating and regulating them?

There will be tremendous debates and implementation issues on the balance between social control and the newfound freedom over the cybernetworks.11

In the economic and commercial sector, some national and international actions are being taken to address issues of property rights and 11 According to the Georgetown Internet Privacy Policy Study conducted in 1999, 94

percent of the top 100 Web sites and 66 percent of all sampled Web sites surveyed had privacy policies. However, which policies are implemented and the consequences of these policies remain to be studied.

regulations (e.g., taxation). On July 1, 1997, the Clinton administration issued A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce , presenting the U.S. government’s strategy to facilitate the growth of e-commerce.

Subsequently, Congress enacted legislation that accomplished four of the president’s objectives: (1) the Internet Tax Freedom Act placed a three-year moratorium on new and discriminatory taxes on Internet commerce; (2) the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ratified and implemented the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, protecting copyrighted material online; (3) the Government Paperwork Elimination Act encouraged prompt implementation of e-filing and record-keeping systems by the federal government; and (4) the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act protected the privacy of young children online. In May 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) reached an agreement by which members would continue the practice of not imposing customs duties on e-commerce transmissions. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and industry groups issued a declaration in October 1998 supporting the tax principles outlined in Clinton’s strategy and opposing discriminatory taxation imposed on Internet and e-commerce. But at the moment, the growth of cybernetworks is substantially outpacing such national and international efforts to regulate them.

5. Actions seem to gain the upper hand in interactions with structures in cybernetworks (McLaughlin, Osborne, and Ellison 1997; Smith 1999; Wellman and Gulia 1999). Individuals, groups, and organizations can create institutions and capital by forming chat rooms, clubs, and groups without many structural constraints. Rules and practices are being created and implemented as these「villages」evolve (Agre 1998). What are the motives for extending networks in cyberspace, and what are the intended goals and payoffs (Kollock 1999)? Is wealth superseded by reputation, power, or sentiment as the expected return in such villages? Are there definitions and declarations of membership, control of boundaries, and rules of exchange and commitment in sharing resources?

Capital in the form of credentials is being created and conferred, and markets for the capital are being created. In higher education, for example, tens of thousands of courses were available online in 1999 (tele-campus.edu), and the estimate was that the number of people taking at least one college course over the Internet would triple by the year 2002

to about 2.2 million in the United States alone ( PC World , July 1999, p. 39). Virtual degrees were rapidly being granted online (e.g., virtual universities such as Jones International University, accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, 1999,

Cybernetworks and the Global Village 237

www.jonesinternational.edu and virtual masters in business administration offered by Duke University, among others).

Social movements challenging existing institutions have benefited from the opportunity afforded by cybernetworks to mobilize social capital.

The Falun Gong incident created a new ball game in challenging existing ideologies and institutions. Will cybernetworks improve the opportunities for peaceful transitions and transformations, or will they accelerate dramatic changes in social institutions (Gurak 1999; Uncapher 1999)? Will they supplement or replace face-to-face exchanges for social capital? Will they help the disadvantaged in mounting collective actions (Schmitz 1997; Mele 1999)?

Inevitably there will be tensions, conflicts, violence, competition, and coordination issues among the villages in cyberspace. When and how do villages claim self-defense or self-interest and invade other villages for resources? How do villages become imperial or colonial powers?

How do villages defend themselves and form coalitions? Will a

「United Nations」emerge in cyberspace, and under what rules and practices? Would such a global body be dominated by the core villages?

Concluding Remarks

The thesis that social capital is on the decline in the United States and elsewhere is obviously premature and, in fact, false. The rise of the Internet and cybernetworks signals a revolutionary growth of social capital.

This form of communication has begun to show a「correcting」trend if we take seriously Putnam’s hypothesis that TV viewing is the culprit accounting for the decline of social capital in the more traditional form of participation in social associations and groups. A Nielsen survey conducted in July 1999 shows that since it began monitoring in August 1998, home use of the Internet and online services has continued to cut into TV viewing. Wired homes watched an average of 13 percent less TV (about one hour daily) than others – equivalent to thirty-two hours per month. The number of wired homes rose from 22 million in 1997

to 35 million in 1999, an increase rate of 60 percent in less than two years. Gary Gabelhouse of Fairfield Research in Lincoln, Nebraska, reported ( USA Today , July 20, 1999) that TV viewing was down from four and a half hours daily in 1995 to about two hours in June 1999, when the survey of 1,000 U.S. adults was conducted. He stated,「People are shifting away from passive TV-style entertainment.」His data further showed that researching and communicating on the Internet, rather than

being entertained, took up 70 percent of the average sixty-four minutes a day of online time. The term couch potato may still characterize certain age groups, but the fact that TV viewing time is down significantly on weekdays, after school and work (4:30–6 p.m.) – 17 percent less TV

watching than other groups, and even during prime time (8–11 p.m.) (wired homes’ TV use was 6 percent less than that of others) – indicates that a new wired generation that clearly prefers to seek information and interactions through cybernetworks is quickly emerging.

This revolution, based on「the triumph of capitalism, the English language, and technology」(Bloomberg 1999, p. 11), has indeed transformed individuals, groups, and the world with shocking speed and in shocking ways (Miller 1999; Zuckerman 1999). Yet, at the same time, it has brought about a further unequal distribution of capital among societies and individuals. The paradox is that while the revolution widens the divide between those who gain access to more and richer capital and others who are being shut out of such opportunities and benefits, those in the cybernetworks have seen an equalization of opportunities and benefits as wide-open competition and channels reduce power, and thus capital differentials, among groups and individuals.

With the increasing development of technology and the continuing presence of commercial interests, cybernetworks fuse socio-economic-technological elements in social relations and social capital. This new feature poses new questions regarding access to and use of social capital.

As technology has already made it possible to create virtual reality (e.g., audiovisual, three-dimensional, touch-sensitive) and transcend time (using wireless and inexpensive equipment, for example), such that love, passion, hatred, and murder are being「real-ized」and personalized (e.g., Internet romances and murders have occurred: Washington Post , March 6, 1999, p. A2; decency and free speech are clashing: Time , February 15, 1999, p. 52; personal data and histories are becoming increasingly public: USA Today , January 18, 1999, p. 3B; Yugoslav sites used e-mail to engage in cyberwar during the Kosovo conflict: Wall Street Journal , April 8, 1999), will cybernetworks break the dominance of elite classes and differential utility in social capital? Yet, technology requires resources and skills. While the globalization process is underway, cybernetworks may tend to exclude many underdeveloped societies and disadvantaged members of many societies. Will these developments further unequalize the distribution of social capital? And under what conditions?

Will these developments further segregate the world into the haves and the have-nots? Analyses must evaluate these questions relative to different aspects of social capital (information, influence, social credentials, and reinforcement) and different outcomes (instrumental and expressive).

I suspect that the entire spectrum of the development and utility of all forms of capital can be examined on cybernetworks, which fundamentally are relations and embedded resources – a form of social capital. We need data on cybernetworks as global villages – the formation and development of social groups and social organizations (the villages), especially (1) how each group and territory is defined or undefined (closure versus openness); (2) how membership is claimed, defined, or acknowledged (i.e., residents and citizens); (3) what the membership is composed of (e.g., demographics: individuals, households, and clusters; age, gender, ethnicity, linguistics, socioeconomic assets); and (4) how resources are distributed within a village and across villages: class and inequality among villages. In short, then, much work is urgently needed to understand how cybernetworks build and segment social capital. The topics just mentioned will provide data that will allow scholars to understand new institutions and cultures as they emerge, as well as the interactions between human and social capital. Most importantly, I suggest, they will provide clues as to whether and how social capital may be outpacing personal capital in significance and effect, and how civil society, instead of dying, may be expanding and becoming global.
