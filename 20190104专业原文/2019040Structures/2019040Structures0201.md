# 0201. Why structures carry loads

or the springiness of solids

Let us begin at the beginning with Newton who said that action and reaction are equal and opposite. This means that every push must be matched and balanced by an equal and opposite push. It does not matter how the push arises. It may be a 'dead' load for instance: that is to say a stationary weight of some kind. If I weigh 200 pounds and stand on the floor, then the soles of my feet push downwards on the floor with a push or thrust of 200 pounds; that is the business of feet. At the same time the floor must push upwards on my feet with a thrust of 200 pounds; that is the business of floors. If the floor is rotten and cannot furnish a thrust of 200 pounds then I shall fall through the floor. If however, by some miracle, the floor produced a larger thrust than my feet have called upon it to produce, say 201 pounds, then the result would be still more surprising because, of course, I should become airborne.

The New Science of Strong Materials – or Why you don't fall through the floor (Chapter 2)

We might start by asking how it is that any inanimate solid, such as steel or stone or timber or plastic, is able to resist a mechanical force at all – or even to sustain its own weight? This is, essentially, the problem of 'Why we don't fall through the floor' and the answer is by no means obvious. It lies at the root of the whole study of structures and is intellectually difficult. In the event, it proved too difficult for Galileo, and the credit for the achievement of any real understanding of the problem is due to that very cantankerous man Robert Hooke (1635–1702).

In the first place, Hooke realized that, if a material or a structure is to resist a load, it can only do so by pushing back at it with an equal and opposite force. If your feet push down on the floor, the floor must push up on your feet. If a cathedral pushes down on its foundations, the foundations must push up on the cathedral. This is implicit in Newton's third law of motion, which, it will be remembered, is about action and reaction being equal and opposite.

In other words, a force cannot just get lost. Always and whatever happens every force must be balanced and reacted by another equal and opposite force at every point throughout a structure. This is true for any kind of structure, however small and simple or however large and complicated it may be. It is true, not only for floors and cathedrals, but also for bridges and aeroplanes and balloons and furniture and lions and tigers and cabbages and earthworms.

If this condition is not fulfilled, that is to say if all the forces are not in equilibrium or balance with each other, then either the structure will break or else the whole affair must take off, like a rocket, and end up somewhere in outer space. This latter result is frequently implicit in the examination answers of engineering students.

Let us consider for a moment the simplest possible sort of structure. Suppose that we hang a weight, such as an ordinary brick, from some support – which might be the branch of a tree -by means of a piece of string (Figure 1). The weight of the brick, like the weight of Newton's apple, is due to the effect of the earth's gravitational field upon its mass and it acts continually downwards. If the brick is not to fall, then it must be sustained in its position in mid-air by a continuing equal and opposite upwards force or pull in the string. If the string is too weak, so that it cannot produce an upward force equal to the weight of the brick, then the string will break and the brick will fall to the ground -again like Newton's apple.

Figure 1. The weight of the brick, acting downwards, must be supported by an equal and opposite upward pull or tension in the string.

However, if our string is a strong one, so that we are able to hang not one, but two, bricks from it, then the string will now have to produce twice as much upward force; that is, enough to support both bricks. And so on, of course, for any other variations of the load. Moreover, the load does not have to be a 'dead' weight such as a brick; forces arising from any other cause, such as the pressure of the wind, must be resisted by the same sort of reaction.

In the case of the brick which hangs from a tree the load is supported by the tension in the string, in other words by a pull. In many structures, such as buildings, the load is carried in compression, that is by pushing. In both cases the general principles are the same. Thus if any structural system is to do its job – that is to say, if the load is supported in a satisfactory way so that nothing very much happens – then it must somehow manage to produce a push or a pull which is exactly equal and opposite to the force which is being applied to it. That is, it has to resist all the pushes and pulls which may happen to arrive upon its doorstep by pushing and pulling back at them by just the right amount.

This is all very well and it is generally fairly easy to see why a load pushes or pulls on a structure. The difficulty is to see why the structure should push or pull back at the load. As it happens, quite young children have had some inkling of the problem from time to time.

'Do stop pulling the cat's tail, darling. '

'I'm not pulling, Mummy, Pussy's pulling.'

In the case of the cat's tail the reaction is provided by the living biological activity of the cat's muscles pulling against the child's muscles, but of course this kind of active muscular reaction is not very often available, nor is it necessary.

If the cat's tail had happened to be attached, not to the cat, but to something inert, like a wall, then the wall would have to be doing the 'pulling'; whether the resistance to the child's pull is generated actively by the cat or passively by the wall makes no difference to the child or to the tail (Figures 2 and 3).

How then can an inert or passive thing like a wall or a string -or, come to that, a bone or a steel girder or a cathedral – produce the large reactive forces which are needed?

Figure 2. 'Do stop pulling the cat's tail, darling.'

'I'm not pulling, Mummy, Pussy's pulling.'

Figure 3. It doesn't make any difference whether Pussy pulls or not.

结构的根基 —— 胡克定律与固体的弹性

让我们从牛顿开始，他曾说作用力和反作用力大小相等且方向相反。这意味着每个推力必定有一个等大且反向的推力来匹配和平衡，这与推力如何产生无关。例如，它或许是一种「死」载荷，即某种不变的配重。若体重 200 磅 [1] 的我站在地板上，那么我脚底向下推地板将形成 200 磅力 [2] 的作用，这是脚施加的；同时，地板一定向上推我的脚形成 200 磅力的支撑，这是地板施加的。如果地板腐朽了，不能提供 200 磅力的支撑，我就会穿过地板掉下去。但若凭借某种奇迹，地板产生了比我的脚施加的力更大的支撑，比如 201 磅力，结果就会更加令人惊讶，因为我肯定会蹿上半空。

——《强材料新科学研究》

我们可以先想想，任何无生命的固体，比如钢材、石头、木材或塑料，如何完全对抗机械性力量，从而支撑起自身重量？本质上，这就是「为何你不会穿透地板掉下去」的问题，而答案则不那么简单。这个问题是整个结构研究的根基，非常考验智力。到头来，它把伽利略难倒了，而真正解开该难题的是个坏脾气的家伙 —— 罗伯特·胡克（Robert Hooke）。

1-3『胡克脾气不好，之前就听说过，印象中他对哪个「新星」有偏见，好像是瓦特，待验证。补充：后面第二小节的信息给出了答案，原来是牛顿，就说有印象，胡克跟谁不对付，哈哈。（2021-06-19）』

起初，胡克意识到，若材料或结构要对抗载荷，就只能靠等大反向的反作用力来实现。如果你的脚向下踩压地板，地板也一定会向上推你的脚。如果一座主教座堂向下推地基，地基也一定会向上推主教座堂。流传于世的牛顿第三运动定律解释了其中的道理，即作用力与反作用力大小相等且方向相反。

换言之，一个力是不会凭空消失的。无论何种情况，在结构的各个点上，每个力都必须有等大反向的另一个力来平衡且起到反作用。对任何一种结构皆如此，不管它多么微小简单或多么巨大复杂：不仅是地板和主教座堂，还有桥梁、飞机、气球、家具、狮子、老虎、卷心菜、蚯蚓等。

如果这个条件不能满足，即所有力不平衡或不能彼此抵消，结构就会被破坏，或者整体起飞，像火箭一样最终进入外层空间。后一种结果经常隐含在工科生的考试答案中。

让我们考虑一个可能的最简单的结构。假设我们悬挂一个重物，比如用一根绳子将一块普通的砖头系在一个树枝上（见图 2–1）。砖块的重量像牛顿实验中的苹果一样，由于地球引力场对该物体质量的作用，其方向总是竖直向下。如果砖块不掉下来，就表示它受到的等大反向的力或绳子拉力可以维持它在半空中的位置。如果绳子不够结实，以至于不能产生一个同砖块重量等大的向上的力，绳子就会断裂，而砖块会掉到地上，就像牛顿的苹果一样。

然而，若这根绳子很强韧，我们甚至可以用它悬挂两块砖头，绳子现在承受的向上的力就是原来的两倍，即它足以支撑两块砖的重量。以此类推，载荷的其他改变亦如此。此外，载荷未必是像一块砖头那样的「死」配重；任何其他原因产生的力，比如风的压力，一定也有同样的反作用力。

图 2–1 砖块的重量竖直向下，必须由等大且朝上的绳子拉力或张力来支撑

在树枝悬挂砖块的情境中，支持载荷的是绳子的张力，即拉力。在许多结构中，比如建筑物，载荷源于压缩，即通过挤压产生。在上述两种情境中，基本原理都是一样的。因此，若任意结构体系要发挥其作用（载荷以令人满意的方式获得支撑且没有意外发生），那么它一定以某种方式产生推力或拉力，与施加其上的外力完全等大且反向。也就是说，它需要承载所有推力和拉力，而这些推力和拉力正好与其反作用力平衡。

如果一切顺利，我们通常很容易看出载荷为何对结构施加推或拉的作用力。困难之处则在于，弄清楚为什么结构对载荷施加推或拉的反作用力。巧的是，小孩子间或察觉到这个难题的些许线索。

「别再拉猫尾巴啦，宝贝。」

「我没拉，妈妈，是猫在拉我。」

在猫尾巴的情境中，反作用力是由猫的肌肉对小孩子的肌肉进行反拉产生的。当然，这类主动的肌肉反应并不常见，也没有必要。如果猫尾巴碰巧不在猫身上，而是系在某些像墙一样的惰性物体上，这堵墙就不得不进行「拉」的动作；无论对小孩拉动的对抗是猫的主动行为，还是墙的被动行为，对小孩或尾巴来说都没有区别（见图 2–2 和图 2–3）。

图 2–2「别再拉猫尾巴啦，宝贝。」「我没拉，妈妈，是猫在拉我。」

图 2–3 不管是不是猫在拉，都没有任何区别

那么，像墙、绳子、骨骼、钢制主梁乃至主教座堂等惰性或被动的物体，是怎样产生所需的巨大反作用力的呢？

## 2.1 Hooke's law – or the springiness of solids

The power of any Spring is in the same proportion with the Tension* thereof: That is, if one power stretch or bend it one space, two will bend it two, three will bend it three, and so forward. And this is the Rule or Law of Nature, upon which all manner of Restituent or Springing motion doth proceed.

Robert Hooke

By about 1676 Hooke saw clearly that, not only must solids resist weights or other mechanical loads by pushing back at them, but also that

1 Every kind of solid changes its shape – by stretching or contracting itself- when a mechanical force is applied to it.

Figures 4 and 5. All materials and structures deflect, to greatly varying extents, when they are loaded. The science of elasticity is about the interactions between forces and deflections. The material of the bough is stretched near its upper surface and compressed or contracted near its lower surface by the weight of the monkey.

2 It is this change of shape which enables the solid to do the pushing back.

Thus, when we hang a brick from the end of a piece of string, the string gets longer, and it is just this stretching which enables the string to pull upwards on the brick and so prevent it from falling. All materials and structures deflect, although to greatly varying extents, when they are loaded (Figures 4 and 5).

It is important to realize that it is perfectly normal for any and every structure to deflect in response to a load. Unless this deflection is too large for the purposes of the structure, it is not in any way a 'fault' but rather an essential characteristic without which no structure would be able to work. The science of elasticity is about the interactions between forces and deflections in materials and structures.

Although every kind of solid changes its shape to some extent when a weight or other mechanical force is applied to it, the deflections which occur in practice vary enormously. With a thing like a plant or a piece of rubber the deflections are often very large and are easily seen, but when we put ordinary loads on hard substances like metal or concrete or bone the deflections are sometimes very small indeed. Although such movements are often far too small to see with the naked eye, they always exist and are perfectly real, even though we may need special appliances in order to measure them. When you climb the tower of a cathedral it becomes shorter, as a result of your added weight, by a very, very tiny amount, but it really does become shorter. As a matter of fact, masonry is really more flexible than you might think, as one can see by looking at the four principal columns which support the tower of Salisbury Cathedral: they are all quite noticeably bent (Plate 1).

Hooke made a further important step in his reasoning which, even nowadays, some people find difficult to follow. He realized that, when any structure deflects under load in the way we have been talking about, the material from which it is made is itself also stretched or contracted, internally, throughout all its parts and in due proportion, down to a very fine scale – as we know nowadays, down to a molecular scale. Thus, when we deform a stick or a steel spring – say by bending it – the atoms and molecules of which the material is made have to move further apart, or else squash closer together, when the material as a whole is stretched or compressed.

As we also know nowadays, the chemical bonds which join the atoms to each other, and so hold the solid together, are very strong and stiff indeed. So when the material as a whole is stretched or compressed this can only be done by stretching of compressing many millions of strong chemical bonds which vigorously resist being deformed, even to a very small extent. Thus these bonds produce the required large forces of reaction (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Simplified model of distortion of interatomic bonds under mechanical strain.

(a) Neutral, relaxed or strain-free position.

(b) Material strained in tension, atoms further apart, material gets longer.

(c) Material strained in compression, atoms closer together, material gets shorter.

Although Hooke knew nothing in detail about chemical bonds and not very much about atoms and molecules, he understood perfectly well that something of this kind was happening within the fine structure of the material, and he set out to determine what might be the nature of the macroscopic relationship between forces and deflections in solids.

He tested a variety of objects made from various materials and having various geometrical forms, such as springs and wires and beams. Having hung a succession of weights upon them and measured the resulting deflections, he showed that the deflection in any given structure was usually proportional to the load. That is to say, a load of 200 pounds would cause twice as much deflection as a load of 100 pounds 'and so forward'.

Furthermore, within the accuracy of Hooke's measurements -which was not very good – most of these solids recovered their original shape when the load which was causing the deflection was removed. In fact he could usually go on loading and unloading structures of this kind indefinitely without causing any permanent change of shape. Such behaviour is called 'elastic' and is common. The word is often associated with rubber bands and underclothes, but it is just as applicable to steel and stone and brick and to biological substances like wood and bone and tendon. It is in this wider sense that engineers generally use it. Incidentally, the 'ping' of the mosquito, for instance, is due to the highly elastic behaviour of the resilin springs which operate its wings.

However, a certain number of solids and near-solids, like putty and plasticine, do not recover completely but remain distorted when the load is taken off. This kind of behaviour is called 'plastic'. The word is by no means confined to the materials from which ashtrays are usually made but is also applied to clay and to soft metals. Such plastic substances shade off into things like butter and porridge and treacle. Furthermore, many of the materials which Hooke considered to be 'elastic' turn out to be imperfectly so when tested by more accurate modern methods.

However, as a broad generalization, Hooke's observations remain true and still provide the basis of the modern science of elasticity. Nowadays, and with hindsight, the idea that most materials and structures, not only machinery and bridges and buildings but also trees and animals and rocks and mountains and the round world itself, behave very much like springs may seem simple enough – perhaps blindingly obvious – but, from his diary, it is clear that to get thus far cost Hooke great mental effort and many doubts. It is perhaps one of the great intellectual achievements of history.

After he had tried out his ideas on Sir Christopher Wren in a series of private arguments, Hooke published his experiments in 1679 in a paper called 'De potentia restitutiva or of a spring'. This paper contained the famous statement 'ut tensio sic vis' ('as the extension, so the force'). This principle has been known for three hundred years as 'Hooke's law'

胡克定律

任意弹簧的力量都与其伸长量 [3] 成正比。也就是说，若一倍力使其伸长或弯曲一个单位，那么，两倍力会使其伸长或弯曲两个单位，三倍力会使其伸长或弯曲三个单位，以下类推。这是大自然的法则或规律，各种恢复或弹振运动都遵循。

—— 罗伯特·胡克

1-2『终于见正主了，胡克定律，上学那会是学到，但压根没有意识到「它」如此重要，可以说是真个结构学的「根基」。做一张主题卡片。（2021-06-19）』—— 已完成

大约 1676 年，胡克清楚地认识到，固体不仅靠反推对抗重量或其他机械载荷，还会产生两个效果：1）当机械性力量施加其上时，固体会发生形变 —— 拉伸或收缩自身。2）正是这种形变使固体能够实现反推。

因此，当我们在一根绳子的末端挂一块砖头时，绳子会伸长，这种拉伸使绳向上拉砖块，防止其掉落。所有材料和结构在负载时都会发生挠变，但程度各不相同（见图 2–4 和图 2–5）。

图 2–4 和图 2–5 所有材料和结构在负载时都会发生挠变，但程度各不相同。弹性科学致力于研究力量和挠度之间的相互关系。树枝受猴子重量的影响，在上表面附近被拉伸，在下表面附近受到挤压或收缩

重要的是，要意识到任何一个结构对载荷做出挠变的反应都是完全正常的。除非其挠度对该结构的用途而言太大了，否则这根本不算一个「错误」，反而是一种基本属性 —— 要是没有它，任何结构都无法起作用。弹性科学研究的就是关于材料和结构中力量与挠度之间的相互关系。

1『材料科学研究的核心：材料和结构中，力量和挠度之间的相互关系。（2021-06-19）』

虽然每种固体在重量或其他机械性力量的作用下，都会在一定程度上发生形变，但其挠度在现实中千差万别。对于植物或橡胶等，挠变往往非常大且十分明显，但当我们把普通的负荷加载到金属、混凝土或骨骼之类的坚硬材质上时，挠变有时就非常小。虽然这些形变往往太微小以至于肉眼不可见，但它们真实存在，可能要用特殊的器械来测量。当你爬上一座主教座堂的塔楼时，塔楼变矮了，这是它承载了你的体重的结果，虽然其形变量非常小，但它确实变矮了。事实上，砖石建筑比你想象的更柔韧，正如人们看到的，索尔兹伯里大教堂的塔楼被 4 根支柱支撑着：它们都明显地发生了弯曲（见插图 1）。

胡克在他的推理之路上又迈出了重要的一步，即便到今日，有些人仍觉得难以跟上他的思路。他意识到，当任意结构在载荷作用下发生挠变时，构成它的材料本身在其内部各处也会以非常精细的尺度按适当比例拉伸或收缩，小至分子尺度亦如此。因此，当我们使一根棍子或一根钢弹簧发生变形（比如掰弯它）时，材料整体被拉伸或挤压，构成材料的原子和分子也将分离得更远或者聚集得更近。

我们今天也知道，原子间彼此通过化学键相连，凝聚为固体后，质地变得非常强韧。所以，当材料整体被拉伸或挤压时，只能通过拉伸或压缩数以百万计的强大的化学键来实现，这些化学键顽强地抵抗形变，即便在非常小的尺度上亦如此。因此，这些化学键产生了强大的反作用力（见图 2–6）。

1『震撼，是「化学键」提供了反向作用力，一下子跟之前学「量子电动力学」知识点关联上了，难怪费曼说量子电动力学可以解释除了「原子核内部的力」「大尺度的相对论」之外的任何现象。（2021-06-19）』

虽然胡克对化学键一无所知，对原子和分子也不太了解，但他完全能理解在材料的精细结构中发生的这些变化，他也着手确定固体中力和挠度在宏观上相互关联的本质是什么。

他的测试对象包括各种材料构成和几何形态，比如弹簧、金属丝和横梁。通过在这些物体上悬挂一系列配重并测量其产生的挠度，他揭示出任意给定结构的挠度通常与载荷成正比。也就是说，200 磅载荷产生的挠度是 100 磅载荷的两倍，「以下类推」。

而且，在胡克测量的精度（并不太精确）内，当移除产生挠度的载荷后，这些固体大多恢复至原始形状。这意味着他可以无限地加载和卸载这类结构，而不会导致任何永久性形变。这种表现被称为「弹性」，它普遍存在。弹性经常同橡皮筋和内衣裤联系在一起，但它同样适用于钢材、石头和砖块，以及像木材、骨骼和肌腱这样的生物材质。正是在这种广泛的意义上，工程师频繁使用它。顺便说一下，蚊子发出的砰砰声就源于控制它翅膀的节肢弹性蛋白的极大弹性。

图 2–6 机械应变下原子间化学键发生畸变的简化模型：a）中性、松弛或无应变的状态；b）材料受拉应变，原子分离得更远，材料变得更长；c）材料受压应变，原子聚集得更近，材料变得更短

然而，对于某些固体和近固体，比如油灰和橡皮泥，当其负荷被卸载时，并不能完全恢复原状，只能维持形变，这叫作「塑性」。塑性材料不仅包括用来做烟灰缸的材料，也包括黏土和软金属。这类材料会逐渐变成像黄油、麦片粥和糖浆一样。此外，用更精确的现代测试方法来衡量，许多被胡克认定为具有弹性的材料，实则并非如此。

但是，胡克的观察作为一种宽泛的归纳仍然是合理的，也为现代弹性科学奠定了基础。时至今日回头看，大部分材料和结构 —— 不仅包括机械、桥梁和建筑物，还有树木、动物、岩石、山丘以及地球本身 —— 皆被视为弹簧的观念，可能看似很简单（或许显而易见），但通过胡克的日记我们看到，他为此花费了很多心血，也产生了很多疑问。这或许是历史上最伟大的智慧成果之一。

在同克里斯托弗·雷恩爵士（Sir Christopher Wren）的一系列私下争论中，胡克提炼出自己的观念。1679 年，他在论文《论恢复的潜力 —— 弹簧》中公布了他的实验。文章里有一句著名的论断，「延伸则有力」。300 年来，我们称这个原理为「胡克定律」。

## 2.2 How elasticity got bogged down

But to make an enemy of Newton was fatal. For Newton, right or wrong, was implacable.

Margaret 'Espinasse, Robert Hooke (Heinemann, 1956)

Although in modern times Hooke's law has been of the very greatest service to engineers, in the form in which Hooke originally propounded it its practical usefulness was rather limited. Hooke was really talking about the deflections of a complete structure – a spring, a bridge or a tree – when a load is applied to it.

If we think for one moment, it is obvious that the deflection of a structure is affected both by its size and geometrical shape and also by the sort of material from which it is made. Materials vary very greatly in their intrinsic stiffness. Things like rubber or flesh are easily distorted by small forces which we can apply with our fingers. Other substances such as wood and bone and stone and most metals are very considerably stiffer, and, although no material can be absolutely 'rigid', a few solids like sapphire and diamond are very stiff indeed.

We can make objects of the same size and shape, such as ordinary plumber's washers, out of steel and also out of rubber. It is clear that the steel washer is very much more rigid (in fact about 30,000 times more rigid) than the rubber one. Again, if we make a thin spiral spring and also a thick and massive girder from the same material – such as steel – then the spring will naturally be very much more flexible than the girder. We need to be able to separate and to quantify these effects, for in engineering, as in biology, we are ringing the changes of these variables all the time and we need some reliable way of sorting the whole thing out.

After such a promising start it is rather surprising that no scientific way of coping with this difficulty emerged until 120 years after Hooke's death. In fact, throughout the eighteenth century remarkably little real progress was made in the study of elasticity. The reasons for this lack of progress were no doubt complex, but in general it can be said that, while the scientists of the seventeenth century saw their science as interwoven with the progress of technology – a vision of the purpose of science which was then almost new in history – many of the scientists of the eighteenth century thought of themselves as philosophers working on a plane which was altogether superior to the sordid problems of manufacturing and commerce. This was, of course, a reversion to the Greek view of science. Hooke's law provided a broad philosophical explanation of some rather commonplace phenomena which was quite adequate for the gentleman-philosopher who was not very interested in the technical details.

With all this, however, we cannot leave out the personal influence of Newton (1642–1727) himself or the after-effects of the bitter enmity which existed between Newton and Hooke. Intellectually, Hooke was probably nearly as able as Newton, and he was certainly even more touchy and vain; but in other respects they were men of totally different temperaments and interests. Basically, although they both came from fairly modest backgrounds, Newton was a snob whereas Hooke, though a personal friend of Charles II, was not.

Unlike Newton, Hooke was an earthy sort of person who was occupied with an enormous number of very practical problems about elasticity and springs and clocks and buildings and microscopes and the anatomy of the common flea. Among Hooke's inventions which are still in use today are the universal joint, used in car transmissions, and the iris diaphragm, which is used in most cameras. Hooke's carriage lamp, in which, as the candle burnt down, its flame was kept in the centre of the optical system by means of a spring feed, went out of use only in the 1920s. Such lamps are still to be seen outside people's front doors. Furthermore, Hooke's private life out-sinned that of his friend Samuel Pepys: not only was every servant girl fair game to him, but he lived for many years 'perfecte intime omne'* with his attractive niece.

Newton's vision of the Universe may have been wider than Hooke's, but his interest in science was much less practical. In fact, like that of many lesser dons, it could often be described as anti-practical. It is true that Newton became Master of the Mint and did the job well, but it seems that his acceptance of the post had little to do with any desire to apply science and a lot to do with the fact that this was a 'place under Government' which, in those days, conferred a much higher social position than his fellowship of Trinity, not to mention a higher salary. A great deal of Newton's time, however, was spent in a curious world of his own in which he speculated about such perplexing theological problems as the Number of the Beast. I don't think he had much time or inclination to indulge in the sins of the flesh.

In short, Newton was well constituted to detest Hooke as a man and to loathe everything he stood for, down to and including elasticity. It so happened that Newton had the good fortune to live on for twenty-five years after Hooke died, and he devoted a good deal of this time to denigrating Hooke's memory and the importance of applied science. Since Newton had, by then, an almost God-like position in the scientific world, and since all this tended to reinforce the social and intellectual tendencies of the age, subjects like structures suffered heavily in popularity, even for many years after Newton's death.

Thus the situation throughout the eighteenth century was that, while the manner in which structures worked had been explained in a broad general way by Hooke, his work was not much followed up or exploited, and so the subject remained in such a condition that detailed practical calculations were scarcely possible.

So long as this state of affairs continued the usefulness of theoretical elasticity in engineering was limited. French eighteenth century engineers were aware of this but regretted it and tried to build structures (which quite often fell down) making use of such theory as was available to them. English engineers, who were also aware of it, were usually indifferent to 'theory' and they built the structures of the Industrial Revolution by rule-of-thumb 'practical' methods. These structures probably fell down nearly, but not quite, as often.

*In Hooke's time 'tension' meant what we should call 'extension', just as 'tensio' did in Latin.

*Hooke's own phrase. Her name was Grace.

弹性的失灵

然而，与牛顿为敌是要命的。对牛顿来说，无论对错，绝不妥协。

—— 玛格丽特·埃斯皮纳斯（Margaret 'Espinasse），

《罗伯特·胡克》（Robert Hooke）

虽然在现代，胡克定律对工程师来说用处极大，但就胡克最初给出的形式而言，其实际效用相当有限。胡克描述的实际上是一个完整的结构，如一根弹簧、一座桥或一棵树在被施加载荷时的挠度。

若我们想一想，很快就会发现，一个结构的尺寸和几何形状，及其构成材料的种类，都会影响它的挠度。材料固有的刚度差异极大：橡胶或肉等容易被手指施加的轻微力量弄变形；但其他材质，比如木材、骨骼、岩石和大多数金属，则强劲得多。尽管没有材料能够达到绝对的「刚性」，但蓝宝石和金刚钻等少数固体确实非常强劲。

我们可以用钢材和橡胶制造同样尺寸和形状的物体，比如普通的水管垫圈。很明显，钢制垫圈的刚性要比橡胶制垫圈大得多（实际上前者约为后者的 30 000 倍）。如果我们用同一种材料（如钢材）制作一个细螺旋弹簧和一个粗大的主梁，那么弹簧自然会比主梁更柔韧。我们需要在工程中区分和量化这些效应，就像在生物学中一样，通过重复这些参数的变化，找到梳理整件事情的可靠方法。

虽然有这样一个前途光明的开端，但令人惊讶的是，直到胡克去世 120 年后，人们仍未找到应对这个难题的科学方法。事实上，在 18 世纪，弹性研究取得的实质进展微乎其微。进展不足的原因很复杂，但大致上是因为，17 世纪的科学家认为科学是与技术进步交织在一起的（这是科学发展的愿景，科学当时还是历史上的新兴事物），而 18 世纪的许多科学家则自视为哲学家，并认为他们的工作层次完全高于制造业和商业活动中的鸡毛蒜皮。当然，这是一种对希腊科学观的回归。既然胡克定律已经为一些相当常见的现象提供了一种宽泛的哲学解释，这对不甚关心技术细节的绅士哲学家来说就足够了。

然而，除了上述种种，我们也不能忽略牛顿的个人影响，或者牛顿和胡克之间是非恩怨的后遗症。就智力而言，胡克几乎能与牛顿比肩，当然前者更敏感且自负；但在其他方面，二人的性格和志趣截然不同。总的来说，虽然二人都出身寒微，但牛顿更热衷攀附权贵，而胡克虽与查理二世有私谊，却无心经营。

和牛顿不同，胡克是一个朴实的人，他沉迷于大量实际的难题，包括弹性、弹簧、钟表、建筑、显微镜和解剖常见的跳蚤等。胡克的一些发明至今仍在使用，比如，用于车辆变速器的万向接头和用于大多数相机的可变光圈。胡克发明的马车灯，其中蜡烛的火焰借助弹簧进给运动保持在光学系统的中心，直到 20 世纪 20 年代才被淘汰。此外，胡克的私生活比他的朋友萨缪尔·佩皮斯（Samuel Pepys）更混乱：他不仅勾搭每个女仆，还同他漂亮的侄女共度了一段「妙不可言」[4] 的时光。

牛顿的宇宙图景或许比胡克宽广，但他的科学研究不大注重实用性。事实上，就像许多小教员，牛顿对科学的志趣常常是不切实际的。的确，牛顿在造币厂厂长的位置上尽职尽责，但他接受这个职位似乎与对应用科学的追求不甚相干，却和下述事实关系甚大。造币厂是个「政府治下的地盘」，在当时能带给他远高于剑桥三一学院研究员职位的社会地位，以及更丰厚的薪水。但是，牛顿将大量时间都花在了他的秘密世界中，他在其中推演诸如野兽数 [5] 这样玄妙的神学难题。所以，我认为他没有多少时间或欲望沉溺于肉体的罪恶。

简而言之，牛顿打从心底里厌恶胡克，也讨厌胡克追求的一切，包括弹性。胡克去世后，牛顿继续在这个世界上存活了 24 年，他将其中的大部分时间用来诋毁胡克的成就和应用科学的重要性。自那时起，牛顿在科学世界里获得了近乎上帝的地位，凡此种种皆趋向于强化那个时代社会和智识的风尚，故而像结构这样的课题，即便在牛顿辞世多年后，也颇为流行。

因此，在 18 世纪，虽然胡克宽泛地解释了结构的运作方式，但他的工作并没有得到足够的跟进或拓展，具体的实用性计算也未见端倪。

如果这样的状况持续下去，弹性理论在工程中的运用就会备受限制。18 世纪的法国工程师意识到了这一点，很是惋惜，于是试图运用既有理论来建造结构（却常常坍塌）。英国的工程师也意识到了这一点，但他们往往对「理论」漠不关心，而是靠经验法则来构建工业革命时代的结构。这些结构大多坍塌了，但也留下了一些。
