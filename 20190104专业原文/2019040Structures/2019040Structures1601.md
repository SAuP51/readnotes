Told of President Lincoln

Once upon a time I used to work in an explosives laboratory. Naturally very thorough precautions were imposed by the authorities against the entry of unauthorized persons, who not only might sell stolen explosives for a large profit, but might equally well blow the whole place up. Thus this establishment was ringed with barbed wire and alarm bells and armed guards and police dogs and with nearly every device that the ingenuity of security officers could think of.

Now many practical explosives are based on nitro-glycerine, which, by itself, is an exceptionally dangerous liquid both to store and to handle. The least undue familiarity, such as shaking the bottle, may cause it to detonate with the most appalling results, Ordinary safe explosives, such as dynamite, contain a large amount of nitro-glycerine which is only rendered safe to handle by the addition of various substances that have been developed over the years by a succession of rather brave scientists, such as Abel and Nobel. Those who have to experiment with straight nitroglycerine need to take the most fantastic precautions, and the dangers are such that they not infrequently suffer from nervous breakdowns. Not only are nitro-glycerine laboratories physically separated from other buildings by earthen embankments and wide open spaces, but the staff often wear special clothing, including a peculiar kind of boot devised so that they may tread softly and build up no electrical charges, let alone anything so dangerous as a spark.

One week-end some of the local children managed to wriggle under the security fence and to evade the police and their dogs. Finding themselves in an apparently lonely place, they broke into one of the nitro-glycerine laboratories. There was, however, nothing very much there to interest them, so they upset the various bottles and beakers of nitro-glycerine on to the floor, stole a couple of pairs of special boots and escaped, by the way they had come, undetected from that day to this.

This is a true story; but I rather think that it might also serve as some sort of parable, for it is possible that engineers and planners and bureaucrats and do-gooders and all the company of the avant-garde are like children playing in a shed full of nitroglycerine – sublimely unaware that they may cause a major explosion. It is all very well to concentrate on ‘efficiency' and making things work, and of course, it is necessary to meet material needs – though in fact our material needs are more flexible than we like to think. However, people have subjective needs which are more important and much more likely to lead to social explosions if they are abused or neglected.

So, when I listen to some of my engineering colleagues talking, I sometimes shake in my shoes. It is not only that they regard the aesthetic consequences of their work as of quite minor importance but that they regard concern about it as basically frivolous. Yet I think that the more we increase material prosperity, the more serious in the long run will be the ultimate catastrophe if people cannot find aesthetic satisfaction.

When I was an engineering student I used to escape from my classes, panting for air, and creep guiltily to the local museum. Many a mathematical lecture did I cut, spending the time looking at the pictures in the Glasgow Art Gallery. No doubt pictures in museums do help, but in a way such things are a pathetic necessity, a refuge of desperation, not only from the aridities of analytical lectures but, more important, from the all-pervasive ugliness of towns like Glasgow.

Of course it suits the tidy philistine administrative mind to keep ‘art' in separate boxes called museums and theatres, and it is noticeable that the brave new 1984 regimes provide not only pictures in galleries but also music and ballet. But such forms of ‘fine art' can only operate occasionally in the ordinary person's life. They may provide an escape, but they are really no substitute for an environment which is satisfying in itself and is continually present. Most of us find some sort of refreshment in the countryside, but we are pretty well resigned to the dreariness of towns and factories and filling stations and airports and most of the things with which we have to spend our day. Possibly fish which have to live permanently in dirty water may get more or less used to it – but human beings who are conditioned in this way ought to rebel.

We ‘Compound for sins [we] are inclined to/By damning those [we] have no mind to.' And, as Professor Macneile Dixon once said,

... contrast the middle centuries, that unique period in our European annals, with the centuries following upon the Renaissance. How different their respective views of the world, how opposed their systems of belief! Yet in each the doctrines universally held are felt as inevitable, as unassailable. Each age thinks itself in possession of the true and only view possible for sensible man.*

Thus, about the important things, each age has a totally closed mind. Nowadays, being materialists, we are duly horrified that our ancestors were prepared to tolerate physical poverty and to inflict physical pain. But these same ancestors would be just as horrified that we should suffer many millions of people to experience every day the beastliness of London or New York; and that those who work in our Dark Satanic Mills should have to be well paid to put up with noise and ugliness which are largely unnecessary. Even the ‘clinical' decor and atmosphere of modern hospitals would seem to them to add a new terror to dying. Therefore many of us seek some kind of relief or consolation in ‘Nature‘ and we escape, when we can, to the country, because we find the countryside more agreeable than towns and roads and factories. Many people indeed believe that Nature is in some way inherently beautiful and, perhaps, in some way inherently ‘good'. Taken to the extreme such views lead to something very like Pantheism – to Meredith's Woods of Westermain. But it seems to me that, if we can only get rid of our romantic prejudices and really look at all sides of the question we are forced to the view that Nature is just as aesthetically neutral as she is morally neutral. Mountains and lakes and sunsets may be beautiful, but the sea is often menacing and ugly, and, so far as I have experienced them, primeval forests are frequently places of horror. Most of the European landscape is not really ‘natural' at all. The kinds of plants and trees which are allowed to grow have been carefully selected and controlled, and many species have been artificially bred to their present forms, just as much so as the domestic animals. The patterns in which the plants are grown, the whole lay-out of fields and woods and hedges and villages – not to mention drainage and land improvement – are the result of human choice and effort.

Before the eighteenth century, when most landscape was much wilder, educated men had a dread of ‘Nature', which implied to them not only physical discomfort, but Pan in the raw. To these people it was the towns which were habitable and attractive, the country which was inhospitable and ugly. Today, when we admire the lovely English landscape we are really admiring something which was deliberately created by the civilized and intelligent English eighteenth-century landlords.

If the country has gone up in the aesthetic world, the towns have certainly come down. Nowadays when we deplore English towns and factories we are deploring the product of philistine reformers and engineers and architects and businessmen and the little grey men who sit in council offices and the bigger grey men who sit in Parliament. Of these people's sins, it is not enough to say that they know not what they do; for we do that which is inherent in our natures – as Plato well knew. It is at least arguable that the countryside is more attractive than the town not because the country is more ‘natural' but because town and country were made, by and large, by very different kinds of people. But the first thing is to see ugliness for what it is rather than accepting it as part of the natural order of things.

We do that which is inherent within us. In a world which has an unreasonable admiration for reason we are apt to forget that the human mind is rather like an iceberg. The rational part of our minds, of which we are conscious, is quite small, and, like the visible part of the iceberg, it is supported from underneath by the subconscious mind, which is much larger.

At this point I am only too acutely aware that we are reaching a stage in the argument which is the province of artists and philosophers and psychologists and that I am miserably qualified to blunder into regions where the angels of art criticism fear to tread. I can only plead that necessity knows no laws, that the modern man-made world is hideous, that sheer desperation induces me – a naval architect manque – to stick my neck out, I think it is really important that some sort of view of the aesthetics of technology and engineering and structures should be put forward to engineers and technologists by one of themselves, however inadequate that view may be. For what follows I commit myself to Athena and to Apollo – by their grace may somebody more competent than myself be provoked into doing the job better.

Let us begin by looking at the human reception process in aesthetics; that is to say, why we react as we do to some inanimate object. Within the subconscious mind there lies an enormous store of potential reactions and ‘forgotten' memories. This material is partly inherited genetically from a remote past (Jung's ‘collective unconscious') and partly acquired by the individual himself during the course of his own life, mainly from apparently forgotten experiences – sometimes unpleasant ones. Now our physical senses – sight, hearing, smell and touch – continually pass to our brains far more information about our surroundings than our conscious mind can accept or be aware of. But the subconscious is monitoring this information all the time and it is full of receptors and trip-wires which are liable to be influenced by every shape and every line, every colour and every smell, every texture and every sound. We may be totally unconscious of this, but it is happening all the same and it is building up subjective emotional experiences within us – be the effects good or bad.

This sort of process may account in some measure for the way in which we are influenced, subjectively, by inanimate objects and especially in the present context by artefacts. Artefacts are made by people and somebody, at some stage, has some sort of choice in the shape and the design.

It is impossible to make any object without making a series of statements in the process. Even a straight line is saying in effect ‘Look, I am straight, not crooked.' Even a very simple artefact contains a package of such statements which have been made by people.

Just as there can be no such thing as a totally objective experience, so there can be no such thing as a totally objective statement – one with no emotional connotations of any kind. This is true whether the statement be made in words or music or colour or shape or line or texture or in what engineers call design.

This brings us from what might be called the ‘aesthetic reception process' to the ‘aesthetic transmission process'. In other words, how do things come to be designed as they are? What is it that the maker or the designer puts into an artefact which causes it to have the aesthetic effects which it does? The short answer is, to a large extent, ‘His own character and his own values.'

Thus whatever we make and whatever we do we nearly always leave upon the thing or upon the action the imprint of our personalities, written in a code which can usually only be read at the subconscious level. For instance our voices, our handwriting and our manner of walking are quite characteristic and are usually difficult to disguise or to imitate. But this sort of thing extends much further than these familiar examples. One dark evening I was in a yacht anchored in a remote Scottish loch. Round the corner of the land, three or four miles away, there came another sailing yacht which I had never seen before and of which I had no knowledge. Though it was quite impossible to recognize her name or her crew I said to my wife ‘That boat is being sailed by Professor Thorn.' And so she was – for the way in which a man sails a ship to windward is quite as individual as his voice or his writing, and, once seen, can hardly be forgotten. In the same way one can often tell which of one's friends is flying a light aircraft, for the manner of flying shows, unmistakably, the imprint of the character. In the field of painting and drawing, even the work of very amateur performers is apt to tell one more about themselves than about their subjects. Again, it requires exceptional skill to imitate really plausibly the work of a particular artist. Naturally there is no sharp line between painting and drawing and technological design, and almost everything that gets made is likely to carry with it something of the personality of the maker.

What is true of individuals is also apt to be true of a society, a culture or an age. Archaeologists can usually date artefacts, such as potsherds, within a very few years on ‘stylistic' grounds. If you walk around Pompeii and Herculaneum, you will come away with a quite surprisingly powerful sense of what sort of people the inhabitants were. This has little or nothing to do with the technology of things like the plumbing, and it is something which no amount of factual history can convey. So far this sort of pattern recognition has eluded the computer; long may it continue to do so.

Recently, I was drinking canned beer with a much respected colleague. I said – rather unwisely and priggishly, I suppose -'Really a thing like this beer-can seems to me to epitomize all the dreariness and commercialism that is wrong with technology nowadays.*

My much respected colleague was down on me like a ton of bricks. ‘I suppose you want to sell beer in pitchers or wooden barrels or wine-skins or something. What else would you sell beer in in this day and age except tin cans? How stupid and impractical and reactionary can you be V

But, with respect, my much respected colleague was missing the whole point. It is not what you do but how you do it that matters. Beer containers are not beautiful or ugly because of the material from which they are made, or even because they are mass-produced. Whatever they are made out of they will convey, unavoidably, the values of the people who are responsible for them. We happen to be a society which is unable to make attractive beer-cans. Indeed we are, I fear, an age rather noticeably lacking in inherent grace and charm.

Greek amphorae were beautiful, not because they held wine and were made of clay, but because the Greeks made them. They were, in their day, simply the cheapest containers for wine. If the Greeks had made tin beer-cans perhaps we should now have collections of classical beer-cans in museums, much admired by artists.

I believe that very few artefacts are intrinsically ugly or beautiful simply because of their function*; they are rather mirrors to an age, to a set of values. Rather the same conditions obtained during the eighteenth century as in Ancient Greece – partly no doubt because it was a classical age which consciously modelled itself on the ancient world. Nearly everything the eighteenth-century craftsman touched was elegant. This was not just a matter of the luxury trade; it extended right through society.

Of course this begs the whole question of ‘absolute' standards in aesthetics. Are not ‘my' values as good as ‘yours', however deplorable and uneducated you may consider my taste to be? Well, I for one feel strongly that there are absolute standards in aesthetics which change only gradually through the ages. The modern fashion for ‘aesthetic democracy' seems to me perverse and nihilistic and based largely on a desire to bash the Establishment. I would take the view that there is a continuing tradition of values in aesthetics – just as there is in ethics. The process is an iterative one, advancing slowly and painfully from age to age and from fashion to fashion, building, like science, on the experience of the past. Otherwise how are civilized values ever to be built up?

Another debatable point is ‘Granted that common objects such as Greek amphorae were beautiful in some absolute sense, did the Greeks realize that they were beautiful?' I am reminded of a remark in a leading article in The Times, which said something like ‘Good typography should be like clean glass – one should be able to see through it without being distracted. But if this is to happen then the typography must have that sort of discreet elegance and beauty which draws no attention to itself.' I think this is why we only come to appreciate many common artefacts after they have passed out of common daily use. This does not mean that they are not absolutely and permanently beautiful.

And the eighteenth century invented the Industrial Revolution. I think it is important to point out that many of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution were not philistines but sensitive men of considerable taste. Of such a kind were Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) and Josiah Wedgwood (1730-95). They made a great deal of money, the things they made were beautiful, and these two at least were model employers. No doubt there were black sheep, but the evils of the Industrial Revolution did not lie in the ethic of eighteenth-century culture and classicism but rather in a newly arisen vulgarity and greed which came, I think, from outside this ethic.

Neither mass-production machinery itself nir its products are intrinsically ugly. The very first real mass-production machinery, the well-known block-making equipment installed around 1800 at Portsmouth Dockyard by Sir Marc Brunei, is handsome and satisfying. These machines were not only good-looking but also verv effective, for they turned out automatically all the millions of pulley blocks needed by the sailing navy during the Napoleonic Wars and for long afterwards. They saved a vast amount of money in doing so, for blocks are expensive things and a single warship might require 1,500 of them. Some of this machinery can now be seen in the Science Museum (Plate 21), but a good deal of it is still in service at Portsmouth after 180 years, supplying the modern navy's diminished need for blocks. Not only the machinery but the product, the blocks themselves, is solid and handsome; whether you would call a block beautiful is a matter of opinion but they are certainly pleasant to look at.

Sir Marc – father of the great Isambard Kingdom Brunei – was a French royalist emigre, and all accounts agree that he was a charming man. We are told that

The dear old man had, with a great deal more warmth than belonged to that school, the manner, bearing and address and even the dress of a French gentleman of the ancient regime, for he had kept to a rather antiquated but very becoming costume. I was perfectly charmed with him at our first meeting. What I loved in old Brunei was his expansive taste and his love or ardent sympathy for things he did not understand or had not had time to learn. What I most admired of all was his thorough simplicity and unworldliness of character, his indifference to mere lucre, and his genuine absent-mindedness. Evidently he had lived as if there were no rogues in the world.

No doubt a very impractical sort of character who would find difficulty in getting a job with a modern go-ahead firm. But his machinery is still producing blocks, nearly two hundred years after he made it – and it is beautiful.

The great engineers who worked before and immediately after 1800 between them laid the foundations, not only of British industrial prosperity, but of the modern technological world. Many of these people were men of taste. But by the time Queen Victoria came to the throne public taste was undoubtedly deteriorating: by 1851 it had reached an all-time low. Shrewd observers, like Lord Playfair (1818-98), were, however, already remarking, as early as the time of the Great Exhibition, that British industry was losing its impetus and its creativity. Although it is very widely and commonly believed – indeed taken as axiomatic – that ugliness came in with industrialism as an inescapable consequence of mass-production, I doubt if this view would really stand up to proper historical examination. I think it is more reasonable to suppose that elegance and business enterprise declined more or less hand in hand and as a result of something rather nasty and complacent which emerged from the British character during the Age of Reform.

The passionate protest of the Aesthetic movement in the 1870s and 1880s against the ugliness of pretty well everything failed to have much effect. I think this was less because these people were guyed by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience and in the pages of Punch than because the movement was largely an escapist one and attacked the wrong targets. These sons of Mary failed to see that the root cause of all the brazen horrors which they hated so much lay, not in machinery itself, but in attitudes of mind. Like so many aesthetic reformers, they rejected technology instead of joining it. Perhaps if they had been prepared to learn technology and engineering they might have operated from within the system. But this is a laborious discipline which too many Arts people reject as being somehow beneath them. Of course William Morris and his followers studied and practised various small-scale technical crafts; but what was needed was to come to terms with real mass-production machinery and with the economic problems of a high-production society.

On efficiency andfunctionalism

But when his disciples saw it they had indignation, saying, ‘To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.'

Matthew 26.8-9

Although we may justly accuse modern engineers of philistinism, nearly all of them do cling to certain very important values which are unfashionable and unpopular in a permissive age. The chief of these are objectivity and responsibility. Engineers have to deal, not only with people and all their quirks and weaknesses, but also with physical facts. One can sometimes argue with people, and it is not difficult to deceive them; but it is of no use to argue with a physical fact. One cannot bully it or bribe it or legislate against it or pretend that the truth is something different or that the thing never happened at all. Laymen and politicians may create what fantasies they choose, but, for the engineers, ‘It is their care that the gear engages; it is their care that the switches lock.' Essentially, these people's stuff must work, and go on working, safely and economically. It may be the engineer's job to point out that the emperor has no clothes on, but however embarrassing this may be, we clearly need more, not less, of this kind of realism.

In the pursuit of their objective profession, engineers have developed a number of concepts which are useful as aids to realism. One of these is ‘efficiency'. Thus it is very helpful to know what fraction of the expensive energy which is fed into an engine as fuel emerges as useful power. This can be expressed as a simple ratio or percentage, and it tells us a most important fact about one aspect of the working of the engine. Again, it is valuable to be able to compare the weights and costs and load-carrying capacities of various kinds of structures. As we saw in Chapter 14, there are various numerical ways of doing this.

But the concept of efficiency is so useful, and sometimes so economically powerful, that there is a danger of being carried away by it. If we try to apply the idea of efficiency to the totality of a situation, then we are usually presuming to a wisdom, to a knowledge of all the facts, which is most unlikely in mortal man. We may fairly talk of the efficiency of an engine in terms of fuel consumption and power output: if we talk of the ‘efficiency of the engine' – tout court – we are being hubristic. We take no account, for instance, of the noise and smell which the engine makes. Or whether the man who has to start it is likely to have heart failure. Or how much pleasure anybody derives from its appearance*

Even if we know all the relevant facts about any technological situation, which is impossible, we could not weight them or quantify them, for many of them are incommensurable. Not long ago there was a great to-do about the proposal to build a vast airport on the Essex coast. This was a project to put down a hideous mass of concrete and sheds and machinery upon the wet, ribbed sands of the Thames Estuary, where the gulls paddle and wheel and squawk. The politicians and the administrators and the economists and the engineers were full of facts and figures about the need for another airport. But it is impossible by any numerical criterion to compare the claims of the planners and the economists With the rights of the gulls and with the beauty of the wet sands: For myself, I am passionately on the side of the gulls, and it gives me immense pleasure to think of all those miles of wet sand and mud, which, I am glad to say, is quite useless and unproductive. So far, the gulls and the sands seem to be winning.

I suppose that it is possible to measure the ‘efficiency' of an airport in terms of how many aircraft and passengers it can handle in relation to the capital costs and running costs, and these figures have some practical value, even if they bear no relation in this world to seagulls and wet sand. But for many things the concept of efficiency is simply irrelevant. It is meaningless to talk about the ‘efficiency' of a piece of furniture or of a cathedral. All the same, engineers cling to the idea that it ‘ought' to be possible in some way to measure the ‘efficiency' of practically everything. But this is nonsense.

‘Very well,' says the engineer, ‘but things must be functional; the beauty of technology lies in its functionalism.' If by this he means that things must work and do their job properly, then he is merely stating the obvious. But when we come to apply functionalism as an aesthetic criterion we are apt to get into some very deep water. There are certain structures, such as bridges, where the structural function is simple and obvious and proclaims itself as such. Many of these are beautiful, but some of them are not. There are also a certain number of very expensive artefacts which are certainly good-looking, such as Concorde and the Rolls Royce car. But are we sure that we are not admiring perfection of workmanship, purchased almost regardless of cost? Ought we not to take cost into account in assessing functionalism?

Now a Ford car can be bought for something like a tenth of the cost of a Rolls, and in the real world, where things have to be paid for, many people would regard the Ford, as more ‘functional* than the Rolls. But the external appearance of the Ford bears little relation to its mechanical workings; what we see is more or less a tin box put round the machinery by the bodymakers and the stylists. The mechanical, that is to say, the functional, parts of any modern mass-produced car are not attractive, being made largely from bits of wire and bent metal which we find it difficult to admire, however useful they may be.

In the same sort of way, most electrical devices such as wireless sets are hideous in their naked wiry state, and we are constrained to hide them inside black or grey or walnut boxes. On the whole it may be fair to say that, as modern technology gets more and more functional, we can less and less bear to look at it.

But have we not good precedents in Nature? The outside of a person or an animal may be very beautiful; the inside is generally repulsive. Our admiration of Nature is highly selective. We admire certain stages of growth (lambs but not foetuses); we are generally horrified by decay and all those worms. But decay is just as necessary and just as functional as growth.

With regard to this question of functionalism and ‘efficiency' Nature seems to have a sense of humour, or perhaps just a sense of proportion. She will construct the stem of a plant, for instance, with the uttermost regard for metabolic economy; the thing is a miracle of structural efficiency. Having done this, she will put a great big flower on top – for fun, as far as one can see. In the same way, peacocks have tails and girls have hair which cannot be considered strictly functional. If it be urged by some dreary person that these things are done to encourage reproduction, this is only putting the argument back by one notch. For why should these ornaments be attractive, sexually or otherwise?

Although it is practically an article of religion with many engineers to believe in a close connection between functional ‘efficiency' and appearance, I am, myself, sceptical. Of course, the grossly ineffectual will, and should, offend the eye, but I doubt if the refinements of technical performance really improve appearance very much. Very often it is the other way round; the pursuit of the last ounce of performance results in a boring appearance, as one can see in modern yachts. For myself, I stick to the belief that what one gets aesthetically from an artefact is some combination of the personality of the maker with the accepted values of hisage. If you walk down any street with your eyes and your mind open you can form your own judgement on both.

‘Science' has been attacked on almost every conceivable ground ever since the Renaissance; most of these attacks were more or less rubbish. But it is always strange to me that what seems the real argument against science is seldom raised, at least in a direct form. This is that science has subtly warped our system of values by teaching us to judge on grounds which are excessively functional. The modern man asks ‘What is this man or this thing for?' rather than ‘What is this man or this thing?' Herein, no doubt, lie the causes of many of our modern sicknesses. The aesthetic judgement seeks, however inadequately, to answer the broader and the more important question. Too often nowadays our subjective judgement clashes with our scientific (or banausic) judgement. But we sweep the aesthetic judgement under the carpet at our peril.

Naturally there is nothing in all this to prevent a beautiful object from also being an efficient one. The point I am making is that the two qualities are what the mathematician would call ‘independent variables'. I am reminded of the Irish yachtsman's remark:' An ugly ship is no more attractive than an ugly woman -however fast she may be'.

On formalism and stresses

Modern art and architecture make a great parade about their freedom from traditional forms and conventions – which is possibly why they have achieved so little. Yet formality in design or in manners is not a handicap; such conventions protect the weak and aid the strong. All the loveliest ships have been designed within a stylistic tradition, and I cannot imagine that their designers felt cramped by it. The Greek dramatists wrote within a strict set of rules, but it would be as absurd to think that the Antigone is limited by the dramatic unities as to suppose that Jane Austen would somehow have been able to produce greater masterpieces if she had felt free to make use of bad language and overt sex. Of course, fully to appreciate formal achievement it is necessary to have some knowledge of the rules. This applies just as much to the appreciation of cathedrals and bridges and ships as it does to watching cricket. This provides one good reason for knowing something about the principles of engineering as well as the history of art and architecture.

When Ictinus designed the Parthenon in 446 b.c. he worked within the well-established Doric order of architecture. The Parthenon, the Temple of the Maiden, is indisputably one of the most beautiful buildings in the world – possibly the greatest of all artefacts. Although it is dedicated to the divine Athena it is, to me, the supreme statement of humanism – of what the scientist Humphry Davy called the ‘brilliant but delusive dreams concerning the infinite improvability of man'. Furthermore, it was built at the very peak of Athenian power and glory and it speaks of the city of the Maiden,

Rich and renowned and violet-crowned,

Athens the envied of nations.

Nemesis, of course, lay just around the corner, very much as it did in 1914. When it was new, in all its white marble, red and blue paint and gilded bronze, the Parthenon might have been just a little vulgar, like some of Kipling. But is not great art always a little vulgar? If the Parthenon is a monument of humanism, some of the earlier Doric temples, say those of Paestum, seem to me to express a moving religious feeling. Contrariwise, the Temple of Hephaistos in Athens, I think, conveys very little – except a faint whiff of commercialism, like Birmingham Town Hall. Yet all these different effects were produced by architects working within a single rigid language.

As with all great art there are many ways of interpreting the Parthenon. What is beyond argument is the magnitude of the achievement. But how did Ictinus do it, working as he did within a strict stylistic convention? Naturally, only one man really knew the answers and that was Ictinus himself; he wrote a book about it, which is now lost. We can, however, make some rather crude analytical observations.

In the traditional, formal steam yacht, grace and majesty are produced by extreme delicacy and subtlety and harmony in the curves of the hull and the sweep of the sheer – by the exact and loving placing of masts and funnel and superstructure (Plate 22). Mutatis mutandis, this is like the exact and loving placing of words in writing. Ship design differs from the creation of poetry only in its numerate content. So again in Doric architecture, it is the loving attention to detail which is important. Although it appears to be rectangular, there is scarcely a straight line in the Parthenon, and few lines are truly parallel. The seventy-two columns are inclined towards each other in such a way that, if produced, they would all meet at a single point, about five miles up in the sky. The eye, which expects a simple box-like structure, is deceived and enchanted by subtlety after subtlety. Like a clever woman, the Parthenon influences us and bewitches us, though we are scarcely aware of how it is done – or even that it is happening at all (Plate 23).

But what has all this to do with stresses? In one sense a great deal; in another very little. As long ago as the seventeenth century, Fenelon observed that classical architecture owes its effects to the fact that it appears to be heavier than it really is, Gothic to the fact that it appears to be lighter than is really the case. In this respect there appears to be no aesthetic pay-off from honest functionalism – from appearing to be just as heavy as you really are.

The classical orders, especially Doric, appear almost to stagger under the burden of their own weight. In fact there is really very little load in most of the columns, but the swelling or ‘entasis* which is given to them provides a sort of Poisson's ratio effect to convince us that they are bulging under the compressive stress. This bulging effect is carried still further by the swelling, cushion-like capitals or ‘echinoi' which transmit the compressive load from the lintels to the heads of the columns. The effect of weight is enhanced still further by the excessive depth of the architraves.

Although classical architecture operates on the emotions, at least in part through a subjective sense of stress, its beauty has little or nothing to do with modern ideas of structural efficiency, in the sense of the one-hoss shay. All these buildings were, in fact, thoroughly inefficient. The compressive stresses were absurdly low, while the tensile stresses in the lintels were far too high, often dangerously so (Chapter 9). The roofs of classical buildings, as we have seen, can only be described as a structural mess. But there is nothing wrong with most of these buildings aesthetically.

When we come to consider Gothic architecture, the compressive stresses in the masonry are, as a rule, a good deal higher than they are in classical buildings, and the structure as a whole is generally more stable, in spite of its airy-fairy appearance. The effect of lightness is, however, achieved, in part, by the use of pointed arches, which, again, are ‘inefficient'. These Gothic structures are, to the modern functional mind, excessively complicated. The real heroes of Gothic cathedrals seem to be the statues, whose weight, perched on pinnacles and flying buttresses, keeps the thrust lines stable (Chapter 9).

Structurally ‘inefficient' as ancient buildings may have been, it does seem that the eye requires some subjective sense of stress if it is to find satisfaction in looking at a structure. In many modern buildings the load-bearing structure, which is often of reinforced concrete, is hidden away inside the building. All that the external observer can see is a curtain wall or ‘cladding' of thin brick or glass which is obviously inadequate to carry any load at all. I do not think I am alone in finding these buildings unsatisfactory to look at and often downright ugly.

But supposing that we had some kind of structure whose means of support were clearly visible, and which was also highly ‘efficient ‘ in the modern manner, what might we expect it to look like? Clearly this is a subject about which one could argue for a long time. However, if we may judge from the structures which are employed for landing on the Moon – in which weight has been saved regardless of cost, the ultimate in one-hoss shays – the answer seems likely to be ‘Hideously ugly'.

On skiamorphs, fakes and ornament

The earliest surviving buildings of consequence in Greece are Mycenaean and date perhaps from some time before 1,500 b.c. These buildings were made of stone and seem to have been deliberately and intelligently designed as structures suited to the characteristics of that material. The Mycenaeans were well aware, for instance, of the danger of excessive tensile stresses in stone lintels, and they made adequate provision to relieve the bending loads on their stone beams, as one can see in the Lion Gate at Mycenae (Plate 24). To this extent, at least, Mycenaean architecture can be described as ‘structurally functional'.

When the Mycenaean civilization collapsed, around 1,400 b.c, Greece seems to have reverted to a dark and illiterate age, from which no buildings of any importance survive. No doubt people lived and worshipped in wooden huts of one kind or another. When formal architecture began to revive in early Archaic times, perhaps about 800 B.C., the early temples were built of wood, like the New England churches.

Naturally, none of the original wooden temples has survived. However, the transition from wood to stone construction seems to have been a piecemeal process; as timber became scarce, decayed wooden members were replaced by stone copies. Pausanias speaks of a temple still existing at Olympia in the second century a.d. in which some of the wooden columns still remained, mixed with more recent stone ones.

Doric architecture is thus ‘trabeate' or beam architecture, based on wooden construction; and even when temples came to be built, de novo, entirely of stone, architects still stuck to the forms and proportions which were suited to timber. Not only did classical architects of the sophisticated fifth century use weak stone beams in the place of wooden lintels; they went to the trouble of copying in marble all sorts of irrelevant constructional details, such as the ends of the wooden pegs which had once held the wooden buildings together.

The result ‘ought' to have been ridiculous, but it was not; it was gloriously and triumphantly successful and has served as a model for the civilized world, on and off, for two thousand years. Survivals of this sort are known as ‘skiamorphs' (shadow shapes), and in one form or another they are very common in technology, A modern instance is the survival of timber graining on the surfaces of plastic mouldings and furniture.

Contrary to the whole ethic of the functionalist school of engineering aesthetic thought, skiamorphs are not necessarily shoddy or vulgar. Nowadays, of course, they very often are; but surely this is because of our own faulty execution, not because there is something inherently wrong with the idea.

The development of the Watson steam yacht is a splendid example of a successful skiamorph. The classical form for large steam yachts was evolved in latish Victorian times by the greatest of all yacht designers, G. L. Watson (who had for his epitaph ‘Justice to the line and equity to the plummet'). For his fully powered vessels Watson retained, not only the graceful ‘clipper' bow of the sailing ship, but also the now functionless bowsprit. The result is one of the most beautiful ship conventions which has ever been developed (Plate 22).

If all this be so, what are we to think about ‘honesty' in design? Honesty compels me to say ‘Not much'. If skiamorphs are permissible in Greek temples and steam yachts, what are we to think of the total ‘fake'? Is there any reason why we should not dress up suspension bridges as medieval castles, motor cars to look like stage coaches, or yew-trees to look like peacocks?

Personally I am rather in favour of it. After all, the results could hardly look worse or more depressing than the results of modern functionalism, and they might be a lot more fun. What is wrong with eighteenth-century ‘Gothick' buildings? The best of them are tremendous fun and perfectly lovely. Horace Walpole was no fool, and the Pavilion at Brighton is a delight.
