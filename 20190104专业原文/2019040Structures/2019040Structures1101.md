1 Kings 7.1-3 (New English Bible)

A solid roof over one's head is one of the prime requirements of a civilized existence, but permanent roofs are heavy and the problem of supporting them is really as old as civilization itself. When one looks at a famous and beautiful building – or indeed at any building – it is illuminating to bear in mind that the way in which the architect has chosen to solve his roofing problem has affected not only the appearance of the roof itself, but also the design of the walls and the windows and indeed the whole character of the building.

In fact, the problem of supporting a roof is essentially similar in its nature to the problem of making a bridge, with the difference that, since the walls of buildings are likely to be thinner and weaker than the piers of bridges, any sideways thrust which the roof may impose must be considered even more carefully. As we saw in Chapter 9, if the roof pushes outwards too hard upon the tops of the walls on which it rests, the line of the thrust in the masonry will be displaced to a dangerous extent and the walls will collapse.

Many Roman buildings and practically all Byzantine formal architecture made use of vaulted or domed roofs. These arch-like structures thrust vigorously outwards upon their supports, and in most cases this was catered for by resting the roofs upon very thick walls within which the thrust line had generally plenty of room to wander about in safety. As we have seen, these thick walls were often made from mass concrete, sometimes lightened and thickened by the incorporation of empty wine jars. Such walls were structurally stable, and they had the additional advantage of providing excellent heat insulation in hot climates: a Byzantine church is often the only cool place in a Greek village. However, it is not easy to make windows in very thick walls, and such windows as existed in Roman and Byzantine buildings were usually small and placed high up.

The medieval castles were built pretty much in the Roman tradition, frequently, as at Corfe Castle, from mass concrete many yards thick. Such walls were well able to resist the thrusts set up by the vaulted roofs; and, for military reasons, the defenders did not really want windows anyway. The earlier Norman or ‘Romanesque' churches were not very different, and their thick walls, little, rounded arches and small windows derive directly from late Roman prototypes. Most of the early Romanesque churches were satisfactory enough, and many of them survive today.* The difficulties and complications arose later on and are to a great extent associated with the growing fashion for bigger and better windows.

Understandably, people living in sun-drenched countries do not feel quite the same about windows as northerners, and even today many of them seem to dwell, apparently from choice, in a perpetual shuttered twilight. No doubt this is all part of a long Mediterranean tradition, for in Greek and Roman and Byzantine times such windows as existed were generally small and rather ineffectual.† As far as one can see, this was by no means entirely due to a shortage of glass.

In northern Europe, even warlike knights and barons did not want to spend all their time in gloomy and nearly windowless castles. What they wanted was light and sunshine, and so they tired of architectural forms based upon dark Roman models. The cult of windows became an obsession, and, as time went on, builders competed in constructing both halls and churches with larger and larger and ever more splendid windows. The medieval craftsmen may have been hopelessly unscientific but they were sometimes much more creative than we generally recognize. In particular we owe them a great debt for showing us what beautiful and exciting things can be done with windows.

However, much of the effect of an impressive and expensive window is lost if it has to be inserted into a tunnel-like opening in a thick wall. Inevitably, attempts to provide bigger windows set in thinner walls ran into trouble with thrust lines. Norman architecture was basically Roman architecture and cannot be made to do this sort of thing, because it depends for its stability and safety on the use of thick walls. But this did not stop builders from trying, and it has been said of late Romanesque architecture that the question to ask of any particular building is ‘not whether, but when, the Great Tower fell'.

Figure 1. King's College Chapel, Cambridge.

Just how clearly the medieval masons appreciated what was happening is not certain. Most probably their understanding of the situation was muddled and subjective; otherwise they would not have gone on making the same mistakes for several generations. Sooner or later, however, somebody realized that the way to deal with a demand for large windows and thin walls was to make use of buttresses, which could prop the wall against the outward thrust of the roof by pushing against it from outside.* Effectively, buttresses make the wall thicker, and so they do the same job as the Roman wine bottles, only in a different way.

Figure 2. The introduction of side aisles and a clerestory required the invention of the flying buttress.

The ordinary solid buttress is really no more than a local thickening of the wall between the windows. Where there is only a single aisle, as in King's College Chapel (Figure 1 and Plate 13), it is very effective. Difficulties arose, however, with side aisles. In order to prop the roof of the nave without unduly shading the clerestory windows, the Gothic masons had to invent the flying buttress (Figure 2). In this case the vertical part of the buttress is separated from the wall by a series of arches, which transmit the thrust without intercepting much of the light.

The decorative possibilities of flying buttresses in conjunction with large windows are very great, and, as we have said, they are still further enhanced by the judicious introduction of statues and pinnacles, whose weight, as the masons must somehow have realized, helps the buttresses in the tricky task of guiding the thrust lines safely down through the lace-like forest of masonry. In the end the windows became so large that not very much actual solid wall was left to support the building. Like a modern mast, these narrow strips of stonework depended entirely upon lateral support. As a tall thin mast relies upon a network of sophisticated rigging, so these slender walls depend entirely for their stability upon the bracing afforded by arches and buttresses.

By whatever mental process all this was accomplished, the structural and artistic achievement was immense. By the time the master masons had created the Gothic buildings of the high Middle Ages, architecture had lost any visible connection with its classical origins. Few things could look much more different than, say, Canterbury Cathedral and a Roman basilica. Yet the line of descent is clear and simple.

Although buildings like these are often very beautiful, they are always horribly expensive, and in any case arched or domed roofs are usually unsuitable for private houses. Rather than using arches it is much cheaper and simpler to support the roof of a building by using beams of one sort or another. If the spaces to be covered are spanned with long poles or joists, then such beams can transmit the weight of the roof from their ends, vertically downwards into the masonry of the walls, without any need to push sideways and outwards. Thus no unwelcome disturbance is caused to the thrust line and so the walls can be made quite thin and will not need buttressing (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Simply supported roof-truss. This one is shown mounted on rollers to emphasize that there need be no outward thrust upon the supporting walls.

For this reason alone, the beam is one of the most important devices in the whole of structural engineering. In fact, however, the applications of the beam – and of its equivalent, the truss -extend far beyond the roofing of buildings; and beams and beam theory have played a very important part indeed in making technological civilization possible. Similar ideas are also continually cropping up in biology.

The word ‘beam' means a tree in Old English, and this usage still survives in tree names like ‘whitebeam' and ‘hornbeam'. Although nowadays beams are very commonly made from steel or reinforced concrete, for a great many years a ‘beam', in the structural sense, implied a baulk of timber, very often a whole tree-trunk. Although it is cheaper and much less trouble to cut down a tree than to build a masonry arch or vault, the supply of suitable large trees is not unlimited and a time arrives when long pieces of timber become scarce. When this happens one may be forced to try to construct roofs from short lengths of material.

Roof trusses

To the modern mind it might seem fairly clear that the most promising way to try to bridge a roof-span using short pieces of timber would be to join the short members together, Meccano-fashion, so as to make a triangulated structure, something like Figure 4. This is really the beginning of a lattice girder. We are all familiar with lattice girders in steel railway bridges. Any triangulated lattice structure of this kind is called a ‘truss'. Like a long solid beam, when a roof-truss is properly designed it allows considerable spans to be roofed economically and without putting any dangerous outward thrusts upon the supporting walls. As with beams and beam theory, the applications of trussing in modern technology are far wider than this and extend to ships and bridges and aeroplanes and to all manner of other structural devices. As we have seen in the last chapter, the tied arch is really another example of the same idea.

Figure 4. If long pieces of timber cannot be got, then a roof-truss could be built up, Meccano-fashion, from short pieces.

However, in the history of architecture the concept of the truss or lattice beam was surprisingly slow in developing. The most primitive form of this idea, the ordinary wooden roof-truss, may seem obvious to us but it took our ancestors a long, long time to think of it. But then they had never seen a railway bridge or played with Meccano. As it turned out, architectural trussing was a late Roman invention, although it never really caught on properly until the Middle Ages. During most of antiquity architects just managed without trusses.

Greek builders never thought of trusses at all. Vastly eminent Athenian architects, such as Mnesicles, who built the Propylaea, and Ictinus, who designed the Parthenon and the Temple of Apollo at Bassae, consciously rejected arches and vaults as a method of roofing their buildings, and yet they failed conspicuously to invent the roof-truss or to devise any really adequate substitute for it. The brilliance of Hellenic architecture seems to come to a stop, rather suddenly, when one gets to the architrave. Greek roofs can only be described as intellectually squalid.

Figure 5. Roof of an archaic Greek temple.

Simple stone beams or lintels cannot safely be used to span distances of more than about eight feet (2-5 metres); otherwise they are liable to crack. Therefore, in order to provide practicable roofs for temples and other buildings, it was necessary to use wooden beams, in spite of the fact that in classical Greece timber had become nearly as scarce as it is in modern Greece.

In Greek temples for which the necessary number of full-span wooden roof-beams could be found, the beams were simply laid horizontally right across the tops of the walls and of the stone lintels of the peristyle. These beams or joists were then boarded over so as to provide a continuous flat ceiling over the whole area of the building (Figure 5). Naturally this flat ceiling, which was only made from ordinary planks, was anything but weatherproof. So a great mound of clay soil, mixed with water and straw, was heaped up on top of it. For an average-sized temple this pile of clay must have weighed something like 3,000 tons. When they had got all this agricultural material up there and tamped it down properly, the mound was trimmed off as accurately as might be to the triangular shape of a pitched or sloping roof. After this the roofing tiles were brought up and simply laid directly on top of the clay, very much like laying paving stones for a garden path. Presumably one hoped that this great mass of wet clay would dry out before the wooden ceiling which supported it began to rot. When dry, it must have made a wonderful sanctuary for vermin; but the excellent thermal insulation would, no doubt, have been welcome in hot weather.

Frequently, of course, it was necessary to use beams or rafters of shorter length. King Solomon had made special political arrangements* with King Hiram for the supply of cedar from the Lebanon, but even so his roof-beams were only about 25 feet long (7 metres or 17 cubits). Many Greek temple beams were shorter than this. In the Greek temples, as in Solomon's building, these short rafters were supported directly from underneath, by rows of pillars, regardless of architectural convenience. In one of the great Doric temples (c. 550 B.C.) at Paestum in southern Italy, there is a line of columns right down the middle of the nave, dividing it into two equal aisles. This must have made any kind of religious ceremony very awkward. In most of the later temples more seemly and more symmetrical arrangements were generally achieved (Figure 6), but even the interior of the Parthenon was cluttered up with pillars which we should think unnecessary.

The simplest form of roof-truss, which was an ‘A'-shaped affair, was developed during the Middle Ages. The horizontal tension member or tie-bar across the bottom of the truss is called by builders the ‘collar'. For short spans it was generally easy enough to find timbers for the collar which were sufficiently long to make a simple triangular truss like Figure 7, but for a small two-storied house this arrangement often results in rather clumsy architectural proportions; moreover, a good deal of spacemay be wasted in the roof. For these reasons builders often attached the collar higher up – in effect putting the upstairs rooms partially within the roof and using dormer windows where necessary. This is all very well, but, if the collar is put high up on the truss, there is a tendency for the rafters to bend or spring outwards under the weight of the roof. This pushes the wall outwards at the same time (Figure 8), very possibly with expensive results. Naturally, the higher the collar is placed, the worse the effect is likely to be.

Figure 6. The more sophisticated temples of the fifth century managed to support their roofs without the use of trusses.

Figure 7. Simple two-storey house with the collar of the roof-truss level with the tops of the walls.

Figure 8. The effect of raising the collar too high in order to save space and cost. (Exaggerated – but not much.)

In large medieval halls and churches, which were often of considerable span, roofing was a serious problem. A trussed roof might be cheaper than an arched or vaulted masonry one, but, even if timbers long enough to make full-length tie-bars or collars could be found, the presence of these collars comparatively low down in the building spoilt the architectural effect of the nave or hall, and, in particular, they blocked the view of the great east and west windows. Since people in those days were often so backward as to pay more attention to appearances than to ‘efficiency', Continental builders stuck to masonry vaulting, supporting their arched roofs by means of elaborate and expensive buttressing.

Figure 9. Simple hammer-beam roof. The effect is to move the point of application of the outward thrust (which results from the distortion of the truss) further down the walls so that it has less effect on the thrust line. At the same time the view of the end window is kept clear.

Characteristically, the English builders produced a compromise or palliative type of timber roof, which has been described as ‘more ingenious than scientific'. This was the ‘hammer-beam' roof (Figure 9). Hammer-beam roofs became comparatively popular for large buildings in England, and they can be seen in Westminster Hall, in many Oxbridge colleges and in some large private houses today. They are much admired by the artistic, perhaps partly because of the opportunities which the ‘knuckles' of the trusses afforded to imaginative wood-carvers. Dorothy Sayers addicts will remember the adventures of Lord Peter Wimsey among the angels and cherubim carved upon the hammer-beams in the church of Fenchurch St Paul.*

In structural terms the main effect of a hammer-beam truss, as compared with any similar large truss with a high collar, is to shift the point of application of the outward thrust further down the supporting walls, so that its effect upon the all-important thrust line is less disastrous. Although this has worked well in practice, the hammer-beam truss has never appealed to the logical Continental mind and there are few examples of it outside this country.

In traditional wooden roof-trusses the joints were made by means of wooden pegs, or sometimes with iron straps. Although these joints were not particularly efficient, the main requirement in such structures was for stiffness rather than strength, and so weak joints did not matter very much. In large modern buildings, such as factories and sheds and barns, roof-trusses are often made up from steel sections such as angle-bars, in which case no particular problems may arise. In small modern houses, however, the roof-truss is nearly always of wood, and the thickness of the timbers has often been cut to the minimum – or even beyond it. The ceiling-joists, in particular, may be barely stiff enough to support the ceiling without causing the plaster to crack. If we are tempted to indulge in the fashionable activity of turning a modern attic into an extra bedroom, the most serious problem is likely to be the stiffness of the floor. Although the roof-truss is unlikely to break, the deflections caused by the extra weight of people and furniture may well cause serious and expensive damage to the house. Amateur handymen, please take note.

Trusses in shipbuilding

There is a land of sailing ships,

a land beyond the rivers of Cush

which sends its envoys by the Nile,

journeying on the waters in vessels of reed.

Isaiah 18.1-2 (c. 740 B.C.; New English Bible)

As a matter of fact, trusses of various kinds were used and understood by shipwrights for many centuries before builders and shore-going architects got round to the idea. Most histories of shipbuilding begin with the boats which the Ancient Egyptians made for use on the Nile. As the prophet Isaiah seems to have been well aware, these boats were constructed by tying together several parallel bundles of reeds. Actually, these reed boats, which developed from rafts, date back to long before the time of Isaiah, probably to somewhere between 4,000 and 3,000 B.C. Similar boats are in use today on the White Nile and also on Lake Titicaca, in South America. Since the bundles of reeds naturally tapered towards the ends, a roughly boat-shaped form was achieved more or less automatically. Often the long, wispy, ends of the reed bundles were tied in such a way that they turned upwards so as to provide a vertical decoration at the bow and stern. This feature survives today, sometimes not very much changed in shape, in the high stemposts of Mediterranean rowing boats -especially in the Venetian gondola and the Maltese dghaisa.

Although most of the buoyancy of a ship is provided by the middle part of the hull and comparatively little by the tapering ends, nothing will ever prevent people from putting heavy weights into the ends of a ship. One result of this is that many vessels tend to ‘hog' (the two ends tend to droop and the middle of the hull tends to rise). This state of affairs is the opposite of that which exists in roofs and bridges, where the middle of the truss is usually trying to sag below the level of the end-supports. This condition is called ‘sagging' by engineers. Although in hogging and sagging the forces and deflections are acting in opposite directions, it is clear that in both cases the beam or truss is being bent and that precisely analogous principles and arguments apply.

Structurally speaking, a ship's hull is a sort of beam, and the effect of the hogging forces on the flexible reed hulls of the Egyptian boats must have been very obvious. A hogged ship is a depressing thing to look at, and this state of affairs needs to be prevented for all sorts of other excellent reasons, so that it was necessary to do something about the situation even in 3,000 B.C. In fact the Egyptians tackled the problem extremely sensibly. They provided their ships with what is now called a ‘hogging-truss'. This consisted of a stout rope which was passed over the tops of a series of vertical struts, its two ends being looped under and round the ends of the ship, so as to prevent them from drooping (Figure 10) This rope could be tightened by some form of ‘Spanish windlass'. The latter device is a skein of cords which can be twisted – and so shortened – by means of a long stick or lever thrust through its middle. Thus the big reed hull could be strained to any degree of straightness or vertical curvature which the skipper happened to fancy. As the art of shipbuilding progressed, the Egyptians came to construct their hulls from timber, rather than from bundles of reeds. But, since most of the planks were very short and nearly all of the fastenings might be described as wobbly, the need for the hogging-truss remained.

Figure 10. Egyptian sea-going vessel, c. 2,500 B.C. This one is built of wood but retains the vertical ornaments at stem and stern characteristic of reed-built boats. The wooden planks are very short and badly fastened, hence this ship also retains the traditional Egyptian hogging-truss. Note the A-shaped mast.

Greek shipwrights were more advanced than the Egyptian ones and they built the splendid triremes or fighting galleys upon which the sea-power of Athens depended. However, these ships were also built from short lengths of timber, and their light hulls were very flexible and much inclined to leak. For these reasons the Greeks retained the hogging-truss in the sophisticated form which was called the hupozoma. This was a substantial rope which ran right round outside the hull, high up and just beneath the gunwale. Again the hupozoma was set up by means of a Spanish windlass which could be adjusted as needed by the helmsman. Since Greek warships fought mainly by ramming each other, they had to be able to withstand a great deal of structural abuse. The hupozoma was therefore an essential part of the hulls of these ships; they were unable to fight, or even to go to sea at all, without it. Just as it used to be the practice to disarm modern warships by removing the breech-blocks from the guns, so, in classical times, disarmament commissioners used to disarm triremes by removing the hupozomata.

It is quite clear that the Athenian shipbuilders, down in the Piraeus, were familiar with the principles of trussing, and one might well ask why the Athenian architects, such as Mnesicles and Ictinus, did not latch on to the idea for the roofs of their temples. Perhaps the analogy between hogging and sagging never struck them, or perhaps they just never hobnobbed with shipwrights. After all, how many house architects today ever talk to a naval architect?

When the fragile oared fighting galley went out of use, hogging-trusses disappeared. However, the American river steamboats of the nineteenth century were every bit as flexible as the Greek trireme or the Egyptian vessels on the Nile. Their shallow wooden hulls presented exactly the same problems, and the Americans solved these problems in precisely the same way as the ancient Egyptians did. All the American river steamers were provided with hogging-trusses of the Egyptian pattern. The only difference was that the tension members were made from iron rods, rather than papyrus rope, and they were tightened by means of metal screws instead of a Spanish windlass. Racing skippers claimed to be able to squeeze an extra half knot out of their steamboats by adjusting the shape of the hull by screwing or unscrewing the hogging-truss. The fact that the hulls of these steamers leaked, in consequence, even worse than the hulls of the triremes did not matter very much because they were provided with steam bilgepumps.

Trusses also occur, of course, in many different forms in connection with the rigs of almost every kind of sailing ship. Very probably, the sail is another Egyptian invention, for on the Nile the wind blows upstream for most of the year, so that cargo vessels can sail up the river with a fair wind and drift back downstream with the current – as they still do today.

The first problem in constructing a sailing ship is to erect some kind of mast upon which sail can be hoisted. The second, and much more difficult, problem is to keep that mast in place. Broadly speaking, the masts of conventional sailing ships are, structurally, simple poles or struts which are supported from a sufficient number of directions by the system of fixed ropes which seamen call ‘standing rigging': that is to say, by ‘shrouds' and ‘stays'. If one has a hull which is rigid enough to withstand the pull of the shrouds and stays, this is nearly always the best arrangement, and (as we shall see in Chapter 14) it can be shown mathematically to minimize the weight and cost. However, the Egyptians had not done this sort of mathematics, and, furthermore, they had no preconceived ideas about the subject. All they knew was that they were rather tired of rowing and they wanted to find some way of supporting a new-fangled thing called a sail above a hull which was made from reeds.

Having spent a good deal of time in developing sailing rigs for the pneumatic rescue dinghies which were carried by bomber aircraft,* I can sympathize with the ancient Egyptians about this business of masts. The blown-up hulls of the pneumatic dinghies were probably just about as flexible as the Egyptian reed boats. One cannot really expect to be able to attach highly-loaded ropes to a thing like a soggy balloon or to a floppy bundle of reeds, and in these circumstances the whole idea of ‘standing rigging' becomes rather laughable. Very sensibly, therefore, the Egyptians merely planted a sort of tripod, or sometimes an ‘A ‘-shaped truss, on top of the rather squidgy hull (Figure 10). This affair worked perfectly well on the Nile; I used to envy the ancient Egyptians their solution to the problem, which, unfortunately, was never practicable with the rescue dinghies. The Egyptians did not have to arrange for the whole of their sailing rig to be folded up and packed inside a small bag, which, in turn, had to be stowed in a crowded aircraft.

The hulls of Greek and Roman merchant ships were generally sufficiently strong and stiff」to resist the loads imposed on them by conventional standing rigging, and so these vessels had their masts stepped in the middle of the ship and supported by shrouds and stays in the usual way. For some reason, however, even large Roman ships seldom got much beyond the stage of a single mast, carrying one large square sail, set from one long yard. It was not until the great expansion of sea voyaging at the time of the Renaissance that the rig of large sailing ships was elaborated by multiplying the number of masts and sails. About this time the single mast was replaced by three, called the fore, main and mizzen masts. Eventually, each of these masts was extended upwards so as to be able to carry, above the lower square sails or ‘courses', first, square topsails, then topgallants, and finally royals. (The even loftier skysails and moonsails came much later, an affectation of the clipper era.)

Traditionally each sail – course, topsail, topgallant and royal -is set from its own separate section of mast. That is to say, each lower mast is surmounted by a topmast, each topmast in turn by a topgallant mast and so on. Each of these upper masts constitutes a separate piece of timber, and each is supported in its proper position by means of elaborate and sophisticated sliding fittings. These were arranged so that all the upper masts and yards could, on occasion, be lowered and sent down on deck. Since the larger spars each weighed several tons, it needed both skill and nerve to raise and lower such unwieldy objects in a rolling ship. However, a big warship would have a crew of 800 men, most of whom could have put both steeplejacks and trained athletes to shame. The sail-drill in the Mediterranean fleet in the 1840s has become legendary. It is alleged that, when the admiral had finished his breakfast, he was apt to signal ‘All ships will strike topmasts. Report time taken and number of casualties'. However this may be, it is certain that crack battleships like H.M.S. Marlborough could be stripped to their lower masts by their own crews in a matter of minutes and re-rigged as quickly. These competitive exercises were by no means a waste of effort. Ships carried ample supplies of spare spars, and the safety of a ship in an emergency, or the outcome of an action in time of war, had repeatedly depended upon how quickly crippled masts could be replaced. A limited number of casualties during peace-time drills had to be accepted, as we accept accidents in riding or rock-climbing.

The structural technology behind all this was superb of its kind, and it is worthy of the attention of modern engineers, who are apt to be rather snooty about it. The complexity of the rigging which was needed to support all the tophamper in the later sailing ships can best be appreciated by going to look at the Victory (Plate 14) or the Cutty Sark. The total height of Victory's mainmast, for instance, is about 223 feet (67 metres). The length of her main-yard is 102 feet (30 metres), but this can be extended at will to a total width of 197 feet (59 metres) by means of sliding stunsail booms. All this immense mechanism worked, and worked reliably, for years on end and in spite of the most appalling conditions of wind and sea, being much more reliable than most modern machinery.

The masts of big sailing ships represent perhaps the most elaborate and certainly one of the most beautiful systems of trussing which has ever been developed. At the cost of considerable complexity, the total weight of structure up aloft was kept down to a safe figure. However, when big guns, mounted in revolving turrets, had to be introduced into sailing battleships around 1870, the network of shrouds and other ropes was found to restrict unduly the arcs of fire of the guns. For this reason certain ironclads, notably H.M.S. Captain, were fitted with tripod masts which could be arranged so as to permit a better field of fire. This was a reversion to the Egyptian method of masting, if you like. However, the extra top-weight (if these tripod structures had a bad effect upon the already precarious stability of these ships. This top-weight undoubtedly contributed to the capsizing of the Captain, under sail, one dirty night in the Bay of Biscay. Nearly five hundred men were drowned.

Cantilevers and ‘simply supported' beams

It is evident that, functionally, it does not make much difference whether a ‘ beam' is in the form of a long continuous piece of material – a solid tree-trunk or a steel rod or tube or joist – or whether it takes the shape of some kind of open-work truss. This latter might be a wooden roof-truss, a sea-going arrangement of ropes and spars, or some modern Meccano-like lattice, such as a bridge or an electricity pylon. As we shall see, there are plenty of both kinds of beams in animals as well. The fact that bridges and roof-trusses and horses' backs and dachshunds are usually more or less horizontal, while ships' masts and telegraph poles and pylons and ostriches' necks are quite often vertical, does not make much difference. The essential purpose of all these structures is the same: that is to say, a load which acts at right angles to the length of the beam is supported without putting any longitudinal force upon whatever is supporting the beam. This is essentially what all beams are for.

It might be thought that a thing like a ship's mast was an exception to this, because a mast thrusts downwards, forcibly, upon the hull of a ship. But then the shrouds and stays pull upwards on the hull just as much, and so there is no net vertical force upon the hull, which does not rise or sink in the water in consequence. Similar arguments apply with many animal structures. A horse's neck, for instance, is very much like a mast. The vertebrae, like the mast, are in compression and push backwards on the horse's body, but they are stayed, like the mast, by the neck tendons, which pull forwards on the body with an equal and opposite force.

In the sense which we have just been discussing, all beams, living or dead, do the same job; yet beams as a whole tend to fall into two main categories: ‘cantilevers' and ‘simply supported* beams. There are in fact further variants and sub-divisions, which are frequently useful for examination and other purposes, but we shall ignore them for the moment.

Figure 11. A cantilever beam with distributed load.

A ‘cantilever' is a beam one end of which can be considered as being' built in ‘to some rigid support, such as a wall or the ground. This end-condition is called by engineers encastre – which is merely French for ‘built in'. The other end of the cantilever, of course, sticks out and supports the load. Electricity pylons, telegraph poles, ships' masts, turbine blades, horns, teeth, animals' necks and trees and cornstalks and dandelions are cantilevers, and so are the wings of birds and aeroplanes and butterflies and also the tails of mice and peacocks.

Figure 12. Simply supported beam.

A simply supported beam (Figure 12) is one which rests freely on supports at both ends.

Structurally, the two cases are closely connected. From Figure 13 we can see that a simply supported beam is simply equivalent to two cantilevers, back to back and turned upside down.

Figure 13. A simply supported beam may be considered as two cantilevers back to back and upside down.

Bridge trusses

The road is carried across valleys hundreds of feet in depth on rude trestle bridges, which creak and groan beneath the weight of the train. Anything apparently more insecure than these structures can hardly be found else-where, and I always drew a long breath of relief as I found my self safely on the other side. It is a fearful thing to look out of the carriage windows into the dizzy depth below, and feel that if the frail fabric were to collapse, as it seemed on the point of doing, we should all be dashed to pieces with no possibility of escape. Even in the Eastern States many of these primitive bridges yet remain, and it is said that few accidents have happened from their use. They are, however, very liable to destruction from fire, caused by burning coals falling from the engine.

Rev Samuel Manning, LL.D., American Pictures (1875)

The English railways were built straight and level across the rolling English landscape by the lavish use of cuttings and embankments and splendid viaducts of masonry and ironwork. All this engineering luxury depended upon supplies of capital and labour, both of which were plentiful in Victorian England. Conditions in America were totally different.* The distances were enormous; capital was scarce; the wages, even of unskilled men, were high. In the Land of the Free, where every man was an amateur, skilled craftsmen of the European type scarcely existed. Iron was expensive, but there was unlimited cheap timber. Above all, the American railroad engineers, like their steamboat colleagues, were prepared to take risks with other people's lives and property which made the hair of British engineers rise up under their stove-pipe hats. Yet these British engineers were certainly not unduly cautious men; nowadays we should consider them rash. Nineteenth-century Americans, of course, were in the habit of living dangerously – but this was more on account of their engineers than of the Red Indians or the bandits.

The railroads were pushed westwards as fast as they could be built and with a minimum of expensive cuttings and embankments. When conditions were suitable, the valleys were bridged by means of those enormous timber trestle viaducts which alarmed the Rev. Dr Manning. They will always be associated, in tradition, with the American railways; a fair number of them survive today (Plate 15). Once they had been constructed, the American railways were vastly profitable – the Central Pacific Railroad is said to have paid dividends of 60 per cent – and so they were soon able to convert many of their precarious trestle bridges to solid earth embankments by tipping soil from the top from specially constructed trains until the whole wooden structure was encased in earth and could be left to rot away.

Wide and rolling rivers could not be crossed by the trestle viaducts and so there was a need for large, long-span bridges. Permanent bridges of the European type were often impracticable for lack of money and skilled labour, and so there was a very active requirement for long – and cheap -.wooden trusses, which could be made by ordinary joiners. Since the construction of these trusses was potentially profitable and since the Americans are an incurably inventive people, a very considerable number of nineteenth-century Americans seem to have spent their time in inventing trusses. There are therefore to be found in the textbooks a very considerable number of designs for bridge trusses, each slightly different, and each called after the name of its inventor. We need not go through them all in detail, for they all work upon somewhat similar principles, but two or three types are worth mentioning.

One of the earliest of these was the Bollman truss (Figure 14), which was very extensively used in America – perhaps more on account of Bollman's political talents than his technical ones. He somehow managed to persuade the American government that his was the only ‘safe ‘design of truss, and at one time its use was made compulsory. This may not have been quite so difficult a legislative feat as one might suppose, since it came to be accepted for many years as a practical working principle, by professional engineers, that the technical ignorance of the American Congressman could safely be regarded as bottomless.*

Figure 14. Bollman truss.

Figure 14 shows a simplified Bollman truss with only three panels. In practice there were usually a great many more, and the whole thing tended to get complicated. Besides this the tension members were unnecessarily long. The Fink truss (Figure 15) does the same job as the Bollman truss, but does it rather better, using shorter members.

Figure 15. Fink truss.

We can, with benefit, put a continuous member along the bottom of the Fink truss and turn it into what is more or less a Pratt or Howe truss (Figure 16).

This is pretty well what is generally used in the traditional biplane. It will be seen that the Pratt or the Howe truss will work equally well upside-down – that is to say, either in hogging or in sagging – provided that we take certain common-sense precautions. Furthermore, if we arrange that all the members can take both tension and compression, we can simplify the structure by turning it into a Warren girder (Figure 17). It is this form, or something like it, which is most commonly used for trusses made from ordinary steelwork.

Figure 16. Pratt or Howe truss.

So far, we have considered all these bridges as being simply supported beams, and so, of course, a great many of them were and are. However, a number of beam bridges are cantilever bridges. For some reason cantilever bridges were never very popular in wooden construction, but they are widely used nowadays when built from steel and concrete. A good proportion of the bridges over the motorways are reinforced concrete cantilever bridges. Such bridges generally have a centre-section which is a simply supported beam, resting on the extremities of two cantilevers (Figure 18). This is partly because it is easier to accommodate the deflections with this arrangement. However, there are a few bridges where the two cantilevers just stick out from each side and meet in the middle.

Figure 17. Warren girder.

In the days when very long railway bridges were being built it became fashionable to construct large steel cantilever bridges. The most famous example is the Forth railway bridge, which was completed in 1890. It was the first important bridge to be built from open-hearth steel,* and, in fact, contains 51,000 tons of it. However, road bridges generally do not need so much rigidity as railway bridges (the Forth bridge is said to be the only large bridge in the world over which trains are allowed to pass at full speed), and so most long modern bridges are suspension bridges, which are usually cheaper to build. The Forth road bridge, which has a similar total span to the railway bridge next door to it, and which was finished in 1965, contains only 22,000 tons of steel.

Stress systems in trusses and beams

From all this it is clear that beams and trusses of various sorts and kinds play an immensely important part in sustaining the burdens of the world. What is rather less clear is just how they do it. How do the stresses work in a beam and what is it that really keeps the thing up? As we have said, lattice trusses and solid beams can nearly always be used interchangeably, and so, as one might suppose, the stress system within a truss is not very different in principle from that in a solid beam, although it has the advantage of being rather easier to visualize. Furthermore, cantilevers are perhaps easier to think about than simply supported beams, although as we have seen from Figure 13, the two conditions are quite simply related.

Let us consider therefore a truss in the form of a cantilever which is fixed to a wall (or encastre) at one end and which sticks out and supports a load W, for instance, from the other end. Let us begin, in fact, with the embryonic or nascent cantilever which is the simple triangular arrangement shown in Figure 19. In this affair the weight, W, is directly kept from falling down by the action of the upward component of the tension in the slanting member 1. The compressive force in the horizontal member 2 can only act horizontally, and so it can play no direct part in sustaining the weight. However, they also serve who only push horizontally, and member No. 2 is performing an indirect but very necessary function in keeping the truss extended, that is to say, sticking out in the way it does.

Figure 19.

Figure 20.

Let us now add an extra panel to the truss, as in Figure 20. It is clear that the weight is now sustained directly by the combined upward action of the tension in No. 1 and the compression in No. 3. No. 4 is necessarily in tension but, like No. 2 (which is still in compression), it does not contribute directly to sustaining the weight, although the truss cannot hold up without it.

If we build the truss up into several panels, as in Figure 21, the general situation remains very much the same. The diagonal members 1 and 5 are in tension and 3 and 7 are in compression. It is still these members which directly sustain the load. Taken together, these members are resisting what is called ‘shear'. We shall have a good deal more to say about shear in the next chapter. In the meantime we may observe that the force which is acting in all of these diagonal members is numerically similar. This remains true however long the cantilever may be and however many panels it has.

This is not true, however, of the horizontal forces. The compression in 2 is greater than in 6 and, in the same way, the tension in 4 is greater than the tension in 8. The longer we make the cantilever, the higher the compression will be in member No. 2 and the greater the tension in No. 4. If we make the cantilever very long, then the horizontal or longitudinal tension and compression forces and stresses close to the fixed end may be very high indeed. In other words, such a cantilever will probably break near its root, which after all is only common sense. However, we do have the apparent paradox that the forces are highest in members which do not contribute directly to supporting the load.

Figure 21.

In Figure 21 the downward load, or ‘shearing force', is directly supported, as we said, by the zig-zag of the diagonal members 1, 3, 5 and 7. However, there is nothing to prevent us from complicating this diagonal trellis by introducing more slanting members, which will all perform the same function. In fact this is often done for various reasons (Figure 22). This is just what Nature quite frequently does. The trunk and rib-cage of most vertebrates can be considered as a sort of simply supported beam. This is obvious in the case of a horse. The bones of the vertebrae and the ribs form the compression members of a rather elaborate Fink truss (Figures 15 and 23). The space between the ribs is criss-crossed by a web or network or trellis of muscular tissue which runs roughly at ±45° to the ribs.

Figure 22. The shear can equally well be taken by a multiple lattice or indeed by a continuous plate.

The next step in an engineering structure is to fill in the space in the middle of a truss, not with some kind of lattice, but with a continuous plate or ‘web' of some material like steel or plywood. This sort of beam can take many forms but probably the most familiar is the ordinary H or I beam (Figure 24). The function of the plate or web in the middle of the beam is just the same as that of the zig-zag trellis in a truss, and so the loads and stresses in the web run in much the same way.

Figure 23. Many vertebrate animals form a sort of Fink truss with muscles and tendons making a rather complicated diagonal shear bracing between the ribs.

Figure 24, In many engineering beams the shear is taken by a continuous plate web. But the tension and compression stresses due to shearing are still at ±45°.

Thus, in an H beam of this type, the ‘booms5 or ‘spars' or ‘flanges' at the top and bottom are there to resist horizontal or longitudinal tension and compression, while the *web\ in the middle, is chiefly there to resist the vertical or shearing forces.

Longitudinal bending stresses

As we have said, the longitudinal tension and compression stresses which act along the length of a beam are frequently higher and more dangerous than the shearing stresses, even though these longitudinal stresses do not themselves contribute directly towards supporting the load. In the ordinary beams which we are likely to meet in practice, it is very commonly the longitudinal stresses which are liable to cause failure, and so they are frequently the first stresses to be calculated by an engineer.

Although beams of H section (Figure 24) are common, a beam may be of any cross-sectional shape, and ordinary beam-theory calculations apply to beams of most simple shapes. In fact, the distribution of longitudinal stresses across the thickness of a beam is essentially similar to the distribution of stresses across the thickness of a masonry wall (Chapter 9), with the important difference that, whereas the masonry cannot take tensile stresses, the beam can.

Every beam must deflect under the load which is applied to it and it will therefore be distorted into a curved or bent shape. Material on the concave or compression face of a bent beam will be shortened or strained in compression. Material on the convex or tension face will be lengthened or strained in tension (Figure 25). If the material of the beam obeys Hooke's law the distribution of stress and strain across any section of the beam will be a straight line, and there will be some point ‘0' at which the longitudinal stress and strain is neither tensile nor compressive, but is zero. This point lies on what is called the ‘neutral axis' (N.A.) of the beam.

Figure 25. Distribution of stress through the thickness of a beam.

Since it is important to know the position of the neutral axis in a beam it is fortunate that this is easy to determine. It is quite simple to show, algebraically, that the neutral axis must always pass through the centroid or ‘centre of gravity' of the cross-section of the beam. For simple symmetrical sections, such as rectangles and circles and tubes and H beams, the neutral axis lies in the middle, half-way between the top and bottom of the beam. For non-symmetrical sections, such as railway lines and ships and aircraft wings, its position will have to be calculated -but this is not very difficult.

It is clear from Figure 25 that the longitudinal stress increases directly with the distance away from the neutral axis. This distance is generally called y when discussing beam theory.* Now if we are seeking structural ‘efficiency', whether in terms of weight of material, or cost, or metabolic energy, then we do not want to keep any cats that don't catch mice. In other words we do not want to have to provide material which carries little or no stress. This means that we want, as far as possible, to discard material which lies close to the neutral axis in favour of material as far away from it as possible. Of course, we shall need to leave some material near the neutral axis so as to carry the shearing stresses, but in practice we may not need much material for this purpose and quite a thin web may suffice (Figure 26).

Figure 26. Tension or compression stress due to bending at a point distant y from the neutral axis is s where

and M = bending moment

I = second moment of area of cross-section.

For how to arrive at M and I, see Appendix 2.

This is why, in engineering, steel beams usually have a cross-section of H or ‘channel' or Z form (Figure 24). These sections have the advantage of being relatively easy to make from mild steel in a rolling-mill. They are often known as ‘rolled steel joists' (R.S.J.s), and nowadays they can be bought in very large sizes. Z sections have the advantage over channels and Hs that it is easier to rivet the flanges to a plate. This is why Zs are often used for ships'ribs.

When simple sections of this sort are unsuitable it is quite common to use built-up ‘box' sections. The first and most important use of these was in Stephenson's Britannia bridge over the Menai Straits (1850; Plate 16 and Chapter 13, Figure 11, p. 291). Since the introduction of waterproof glues and reliable plywood, box beams are often used in wooden construction, particularly in the wing-spars of wooden gliders (Chapter 13, Figure 5, p. 279).

The same sort of arguments apply, of course, when we come to consider sheet materials. Thin sheet metal is weak and flexible in bending, and, to save weight, we want, if possible, to achieve a deeper section. This is often done by rolling corrugations into the metal sheet – with corrugated iron as the unfortunate result.* Corrugated metal sheet has been used in the past for the outside skins of both ships and aircraft, notably with the old Junkers monoplanes. However, the objections are obvious, and it is much more usual nowadays to stiffen and strengthen metal skins in shipbuilding and in aerospace by riveting or welding metal angles, called stringers, to the inside surfaces of the skin.

In all these situations the load commonly comes upon the beam from one direction only, and the shape of the cross-section is optimized with regard to this condition. In some engineering structures and in very many biological ones, however, the load may come from any direction. This is roughly true for lamp-posts, chair legs, bamboos and leg-bones. For such purposes it is better to use a round, hollow tube, and of course this is what is very often done. An intermediate case occurs with bermuda masts. These are generally made from tubes of oval or pear-shaped section. This is not primarily so as to reduce wind-drag by ‘streamlining', as is often supposed, but rather to cater for the fact that it is much easier to stay a modem mast laterally than it is in the fore and aft plane, and so the mast section has to take account of this by providing more strength and stiffness fore and aft.
