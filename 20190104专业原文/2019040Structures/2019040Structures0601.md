Part Two Tension structures

# 0601. Tension structures and pressure vessels

—  with some remarks on boilers, bats and Chinese junks

That the ship went faster through the water, and held a better wind, was certain; but just before we arrived at the point, the gale increased in force. 'If anything starts, we are lost, sir,' observed the first lieutenant again.

'I am perfectly aware of it,' replied the captain, in a calm tone; 'but, as I said before, and you must now be aware, it is our only chance. The consequences of any carelessness or neglect in the fitting and securing of the rigging will be felt now; and this danger, if we escape it, ought to remind us how much we have to answer for, if we neglect our duty.'

Captain Marryat, Peter Simple

The easiest structures to think about are generally those which have to resist only tensile forces – forces which pull rather than push – and, of these, the simplest of all are those which have to resist only a single pull: in other words unidirectional tension, the basic case of a rope or a rod. Although simple unidirectional tension is sometimes to be seen in plants – especially in their roots – the muscles and tendons of animals provide better biological examples and so do vocal cords and spiders' webs.

Muscle is a soft tissue which, when it receives an appropriate nerve signal, is able to shorten itself and so produce tensile forces by pulling in an active way.* However, although muscle is a more efficient device than any artificial engine for converting chemical energy into mechanical work, it is not very strong. So, to produce and sustain any considerable mechanical pull, muscles have to be thick and bulky. Partly for this reason muscles are often attached to the bones which they have to manipulate by means of an intervening cord-like tension member made of tendon. Although tendon is unable to contract itself, it is very many times as strong as muscle and therefore needs only a small fraction of the cross-section to take a given pull. Thus the function of tendon is partly that of a rope or wire, although it can also act as a spring, as we saw in the last chapter.

Although some tendons are quite short, many of those in our arms and legs are very long indeed, and they run through the body in almost as complicated a way as the wires of an old-fashioned Victorian bell system. As far as our legs are concerned, muscle is not only bulky but heavy, and the object seems to be to arrange for the centre of gravity of our legs to be as high up in the body as possible. The reason for this is that, in normal walking, the leg operates as a pendulum swinging freely in its own natural period and therefore consuming as little energy as may be. It is because we have to force our legs to oscillate faster than their natural frequency that running is so tiring. The natural period of swing of our legs will be faster the nearer the centre of gravity of the limb is to the thigh-joint. This is why we have thick calves and thighs and, hopefully, small feet and ankles.

However, large feet are not generally so severe a handicap in life's struggle as large hands, whatever people may say about policemen. Our arms, of course, have evolved from front legs, and they seem to have taken the process of remote control even further. Thus, by means of even longer and thinner tendons than exist in our legs, our hands and fingers are operated by muscles located quite a long way away, high up in our arms. So the hand is enabled to have much more slender proportions than would be the case if it had to contain all its own muscles. The advantage of this arrangement mechanically – and perhaps aesthetically – is obvious.

In artificial structures there are a number of simple examples of unidirectional tension, such as fishing lines and loads hanging from cranes. These differ very little from the problem of the brick and the string which we discussed in Chapter 3. However, many of the more interesting cases, such as the rigging of a ship or the design of aerial cableways, are apt to be beset by uncertainties and complications.

In the rigging of a ship there would, of course, be no difficulty about determining a safe thickness for each rope, provided only that one knew what loads they would have to carry. The difficulty lies in predicting the magnitudes of the many different forces which operate in so complicated an affair as a sailing ship. Although there are several ways in which one might set about this, I strongly suspect that most yacht designers prefer to rely on what might be described as experienced guesswork. However, it is just as well to get one's guesses right, since the failure of a vital piece of rigging is likely to result in the loss of a mast. If this happens when the ship is caught on a dangerous lee shore, like Marryat's frigate, then the consequences will be serious.

Nowadays ski-ing is a vast international industry which is dependent upon the reliability of many thousands of cable-cars and ski-lifts. I suppose that most of us have worried, in our more vertiginous moments, about the strength of the wire ropes which support chair-lifts and cable-cars above what seem to be rather frightening chasms. Actually, accidents very seldom occur directly from the failure of one of these cables in tension. This is because in this case the static loads are known pretty accurately, and it is not difficult to do the sums and ensure an ample factor of safety. More serious risks arise from such matters as the excessive swaying of the cables in the wind, so that the cars are likely to strike each other as they pass or perhaps to hit the supporting pylons. Here again, designers seem to rely mainly on precedent and guesswork.

A very different application of unidirectional tension theory is concerned with the strings of musical instruments. The frequency* of the note given out by a stretched string depends, not only on its length, but also upon the tensile stress in it. In stringed instruments the appropriate stresses are produced by stretching the strings – which are made of stiff material, such as steel wire or catgut – across a suitable framework, which may be the wooden body of a violin or the cast-iron frame of a piano. Since both the strings and the framework are stiff, very small extensions greatly affect the stress in a string and therefore the frequency of its note. This is why such instruments are so sensitive to 'tuning'. It is also why one can use the note emitted by a rope when it is 'twanged' as an indication of the stress in the material. The Roman army used to require that the officers in charge of military catapults should have a good musical ear, so that they could assess the tensions in the tendon ropes of these weapons when they were set up and tuned for action.

Although the human voice differs in many ways from a stringed instrument, somewhat similar considerations apply to it. The mechanisms of voice production are rather complicated, but our larynx plays an important part in both singing and talking. It may be interesting to note that the various tissues of the larynx are among the few soft tissues in the body which conform approximately to Hooke's law; most of the other body tissues obey quite different and rather weird laws of their own when they are stretched, as we shall see in Chapter 8.

The larynx contains the 'vocal cords', which are strips or folds of tissue whose tensile stress can be varied by muscular tension so as to control the frequency with which they vibrate. Because the Young's modulus of the vocal folds is rather low, large strains sometimes have to be applied to them in order to cause the necessary stresses; they are, in fact, stretched by a good 50 per cent when we want to achieve the top notes.

Incidentally, the higher frequencies of the voices of women and children are caused, not by higher tensions in their vocal cords, but simply by the fact that the larynx is smaller and the vocal cords therefore shorter. There is a surprising difference in this respect between grown-up men and women, the relevant larynx measurements being about 36 millimetres for men against about 26 for women. However, the larynxes of both boys and girls are of very similar size up to the age of puberty. The 'breaking' of boys' voices is due, not to any change of tension in the cords, but to a rather sudden enlargement of the larynx around the age of fourteen.

第二部分 承张结构

承张结构与压力容器 —— 锅炉、蝙蝠和中式平底帆船

能更好地兜住风的船在水上跑得更快，这是必然的；但就在我们抵达终点前，风力增强了。「如果说有什么问题，那就是我们迷失了航向，先生。」中尉再次报告说。

「我完全清楚。」舰长答道，语气平静，「但是，像我之前说的那样，你现在必须意识到，这是我们唯一的机会。在安装和固定帆索方面，任何粗心或疏忽的后果现在都会显现出来；如果我们玩忽职守，或者逃避问题，这次危险会提醒我们必须承担多少责任。」

—— 海军上校马里亚特（Captain Marryat），

《彼得·辛普》（Peter Simple）

最容易琢磨的结构通常是指那些只需对抗拉伸作用 —— 是拉力而不是推力 —— 的结构，它们中最简单的又是那些只能对抗单一拉力 —— 单向的拉伸，比如绳或杆等基本情境 —— 的结构。简单的单向拉伸有时会出现在植物身上，尤其是在它们的根部，动物的肌肉和肌腱则提供了更好的生物学案例，声带和蜘蛛网也是这样。

肌肉属于软组织，当它接收到适当的神经信号时，它能缩短自身，主动地产生拉伸作用。[1] 然而，虽然肌肉比任何将化学能转化为机械功的人造发动机都更有效，但它并不是很强壮。所以，为了产生和维持足够的机械性拉动，肌肉需要长得既厚实又大块。部分出于这个原因，肌肉常常附着在骨骼上，必须依靠介于其间的肌腱来牵引。虽然肌腱无法收缩自身，但它比肌肉强劲许多倍，其横截面的一小部分就可以承受给定的拉力。因此，肌腱的部分功能是起到绳索或丝线的作用，它也能扮演弹簧的角色，就像我们在上一章看到的那样。

虽然有些肌腱相当短，但人类四肢的大部分肌腱都很长，几乎贯穿整个人体，就像一台老式维多利亚机械钟系统里的金属丝一样复杂。我们的腿部肌肉不仅块大而且笨重，其目的似乎是将腿部的重心尽量安排在身体的高处。因为人在正常的行走过程中，腿部的运动就像一个按固有周期摆动的摆锤，以便尽可能少地消耗能量。而跑动之所以让我们如此疲惫，则是因为我们不得不让腿摆动得比其固有频率更快。肢体重心越靠近大腿关节，腿部摆动的固有周期就越快。这就是为什么我们希望小腿和大腿粗一些，而足部和脚踝细一些。

但是，大脚通常不像大手那样会成为人生奋斗路上的一个障碍，当然，人们对警察这个职业可能会有不同的看法。我们的手臂是从前腿进化而来的，它们似乎采取了更长距离的远端控制程序。因此，手臂的肌腱比腿部的更长、更细，我们的手掌和手指正是通过位于手臂上部的肌肉来操纵的。所以，相较需容纳全部肌肉的情况，手的实际比例纤细得多。这种安排的优点在机械意义或审美意义上都是显而易见的。

在人造结构中，也有一些单向拉伸的简单例子，比如渔线和起重机的悬吊载荷。同我们在第 3 章探讨的砖块和绳子相比，这些问题大同小异。但是，许多更有趣的案例，比如给船舶装配帆索或空中索道的设计，则容易受到不确定和复杂因素的干扰。

在给船舶装配帆索的过程中，确定每条绳索的安全粗度当然不难，前提是弄清楚它们必须承受的载荷是多少。真正困难的是，预测各种作用于像帆船这样复杂的装置的力的大小。虽然有几种方式可以处理此事，但我强烈怀疑大部分帆船设计者更倾向于依赖经验做出猜测。能猜对固然不错，一旦要命的帆索出问题就很可能损坏桅杆。如果事故发生时船舶被困于危险的下风岸，就像马里亚特小说里描写的护卫舰那样，那么后果将不堪设想。

如今，滑雪是一个庞大的国际产业，它依赖于千千万万个缆车车厢和座椅的可靠性。我猜测大多数人在头晕目眩的时刻会暗暗担心支撑吊椅和吊厢的钢缆强度，它们上面似乎有吓人的裂口。实际上，在拉伸作用下，即便其中一根钢缆出问题，也极少会直接导致安全事故的发生。这是因为在这种情况下我们可以相当精确地获知静载荷，计算并确保一个足够高的安全系数不是一件难事。更严重的风险来自钢缆在风中过度摆动等情况，这可能会导致缆车车厢在经过彼此时互相碰撞或者撞上支撑塔。再说一次，设计师主要靠的是经验和猜测。

关于单向拉伸理论的一个完全不同的应用是乐器的弦。拉伸的琴弦的发音频率 [2] 不仅取决于其长度，还决定于它的拉应力。在弦乐器中，适当的应力源自将琴弦 —— 由强劲材料制成，比如钢丝或肠线 —— 拉紧固定在适当的构架上，这些构架可能是小提琴的木架，也可能是钢琴的铸铁架。因为弦和架都很强劲，所以即便是非常小的拉伸也会强烈影响琴弦的应力和发音频率。这就是为什么这类乐器需要经常「调音」，这也是为什么人能将「拨动」绳子发出的音符作为材料中应力的指标。罗马军队曾要求负责军用投石机的军官要精于辨别乐音，以便在设置和调试武器时准确评估腱绳上的张力。

虽然人类的声音在诸多方面都不同于弦乐器的声音，但在某种程度上，也可以用类似的方法考量它。人类声音的形成机制相当复杂，我们的喉在歌唱和说话的过程中都起到了重要作用。有意思的是，喉的各种组织属于人体内大致遵循胡克定律的少数软组织之一；其他大多数人体组织在拉伸情况下各自遵循完全不同且相当怪异的规律，我们将在第 8 章做详细介绍。

喉包含了「声带」，这是一种带状组织或褶皱组织，其拉应力随肌肉紧张程度的不同而变化，从而控制其振动频率。因为声带褶皱的杨氏模量相当低，所以有时需要施加巨大的应变以引发必要的应力；事实上，当我们想飙到最高音时，声带会拉伸 50%。

顺便说一下，女声和童声的频率更高，这并不是因为他们的声带张力更强，而仅仅是因为他们的喉更小、声带更短。在这方面，成年男女之间存在一个惊人的差异，有关喉的尺寸测量显示，男性的喉约为 36 毫米，而女性的喉约为 26 毫米。但是，在青春期之前，男孩和女孩的喉的大小差不多。青春期的男孩之所以会变声，也不是因为他们声带的张力有任何变化，而是由于他们的喉在 14 岁左右时骤然增大。

## 6.1 Pipes and pressure vessels

Plants and animals might be regarded to a considerable extent as so many systems of tubes and bladders whose function is to contain and to distribute various liquids and gases. Although the pressures in biological systems are not usually very high, they are by no means negligible, and living vessels and membranes do burst from time to time, often with fatal results.

In technology the provision of reliable pressure vessels is a fairly modern achievement and we seldom stop to think how we should get on without using pipes. For the lack of pipes capable of conveying liquids under pressure the Romans incurred enormous expenses in building masonry aqueducts upon tall arches in order to carry water in open channels across miles of undulating country. The earliest approximations to pressure-tight containers were the barrels of guns, and, historically, these were never very satisfactory and quite frequently failed. A list of the people who have been killed by the accidental bursting of guns, from King James II of Scotland downwards, would be long and impressive. Nevertheless, when gas lighting began to be installed in London, soon after 1800, the pipes had to be made by Birmingham gunsmiths, and in fact the earliest gas-pipes were actually made by welding musket-barrels end to end.

Although there are innumerable accounts of the history of the steam-engine, relatively little has been written about the development of the pipes and boilers on which it depended and which, in reality, presented more difficult problems than the actual mechanism. The earliest engines were very heavy and bulky and consumed vast amounts of fuel, chiefly because they worked at very low steam pressures – which was perhaps just as well in view of the nature of contemporary boilers.

The production of engines which were light, compact and altogether more economical was wholly dependent on the use of much higher working pressures. In the steamships of the 1820s, with steam pressures of about 10 p.s.i. – provided by square 'haystack* boilers – the coal consumption was around 15 lb. weight per horsepower hour. In the 1850s engineers were still talking in terms of 20 p.s.i. and about 9 lb. per horse-power hour. By 1900, pressures had gone up to well over 200 p.s.i., and coal consumption had fallen to 1-5 lb. per horse-power hour – a tenfold reduction in eighty years. It was not the steamship, as such, which drove sailing ships from the high seas, but the high-pressure steamship with triple-expansion engines, 'Scotch' boilers, low fuel costs and long range.

The high-pressure boiler was not developed without incident. Throughout most of the nineteenth century boiler explosions were relatively frequent and the consequences were sometimes very terrible. The American river steamers, in particular, were pioneers of high-pressure working. During the middle years of the century the Mississippi steamboats used regularly to indulge in dramatic races over thousands of miles of river. The designers of these vessels were prepared to sacrifice almost everything to speed and lightness, and they took what might charitably be called an optimistic approach to boiler design. As a result, during the years 1859-60 alone, twenty-seven of these ships were lost as a result of boiler explosions.*

Although some of these accidents were due to criminal practices such as the tying down of safety valves, most of them were basically caused by lack of proper calculations. This was a pity because in fact the basic calculations needed to determine the stresses in simple pressure vessels are very easy – so easy indeed that, as far as I can find out, nobody has ever bothered to claim the credit for originating them, and only the most elementary kind of algebra is required.†

## 6.2 Spherical pressure vessels

As soon as we come to consider any kind of pressure vessel or container – which includes such things as balloons and bladders and stomachs and pipes and boilers and arteries – we have to deal with tensile stresses which operate in more than one direction at the same time. This may possibly sound complicated but presents, in fact, no cause for alarm. The skin of any pressure vessel really performs two functions. It has to contain the fluid by being watertight or gastight, and it has also to carry the stresses set up by the internal pressure. Nearly always this skin or shell is subjected to tension stresses acting in both directions in its own plane, that is to say, parallel to its surface. The stress in the third direction, perpendicular to its surface, is usually negligibly low and can be forgotten about.

It is convenient to look first at pressure vessels of spherical shape. The skin or shell of the bladder-like object in Figure 1 is supposed to be reasonably thin, say less than about a tenth of the diameter. The radius of the shell, taken at the middle of the wall thickness, is r. The thickness of the wall or shell is l and the whole thing is subject to an internal fluid pressure of p (all these being in whatever units we happen to patronize).

If we imagine that we slice the thing in two, like a grapefruit, then from Figures 1, 2 and 3 it is pretty clear that the stress in the shell – in all directions parallel to its own surface – will be

This is a useful practical result, and it is in fact a standard engineering formula.

## 6.3 Cylindrical pressure vessels

Spherical containers have their uses, but clearly cylindrical vessels have wider applications, especially to things like pipes and tubes. The surface of a cylinder has no longer the same sort of symmetry as that of a sphere and so we cannot assume that the stress along a cylinder is the same as that around its circumference; and in fact it isn't. Let us call the stress in the shell along the length of the cylinder sx and that around the circumference of the shell s2.

Figure 1. A spherical vessel with internal pressure p, mean radius r, and wall thickness t.

Figure 2. Imagine the vessel sliced in two across any diameter. The resultant of all the pressure forces acting on the inside of each half of the shell must equal the sum of all the stresses which would have acted on the cut surface, whose area is 2πrt.

Figure 3. The resultant of all the pressure forces acting on the inside curved surface of a hemisphere will be equal to the same pressure acting on a flat disk of the same diameter, which must be πr2p. Hence

From Figure 4 we can see that the stress along the shell, s1 must be the same as that in the sphere which we have just been considering, that is to say

To get at s2, the circumferential stress in the shell of the cylinder, we now slice, in our imaginations, in the other plane, after the fashion of Figure 5; from which we see that

Thus the circumferential stress in the wall of a cylindrical pressure vessel is twice the longitudinal stress, i.e. s2 = 2s1 (Figure 6). One consequence of this must have been observed by everyone who has ever fried a sausage. When the filling inside the sausage swells and the skin bursts, the slit is almost always longitudinal. In other words, the skin has broken as a consequence of the circumferential, not the longitudinal, stress.

Figure 4. The longitudinal stress, s1 in the shell of a cylindrical pressure vessel is the same as that in the equivalent spherical vessel.

Figure 5. Circumferential stress in a cylinder, s2

Figure 6. Stress in the wall of a cylindrical pressure vessel.

These sums are continually cropping up in engineering and in biology. They are used to calculate the strength of pipes and boilers and balloons and air-supported roofs and rockets and space-ships. As we shall see in Chapter 8, the same simple piece of theory applies to the whole question of development from amoeba-like forms of life towards more elongated and mobile primitive creatures.

Another consequence of the algebra we have just done is that to contain a given volume of fluid at a given pressure will require a greater weight of material if we use a cylindrical vessel than if we use a spherical one. Where weight is very important – as it is with the oxygen-bottles which climbers use at high altitudes and also with aircraft starter bottles – then spherical vessels are usual. For most other purposes, where weight is not so serious a matter, cylindrical bottles are cheaper and more convenient. The 'gas-cylinders ' used in hospitals and garages are a case in point.

## 6.4 Chinese engineering – or better bulge than bust

There is an interesting problem which has to be solved by the designer of every sailing vessel It is: What is the best method of preventing the ship from flinging her spars overboard? Opinion on this point is divided. There are two schools of thought: the Eastern and the Western schools. In the West we think the best way of keeping the masts in the ship is to fasten them rigidly in position with a complicated system of shrouds and stays. The disciples of the Eastern school hold that this is all nonsense – besides being very expensive. They stand a tall and rickety mast on end, set upon it vast areas of gunny mats, bamboo matting or anything else that comes to hand and then keep the whole business erect by the power of faith. At least, I have never been able to discover any other power interesting itself in the miracle.

Weston Martyr, The Southseaman

The theory of pressure vessels, which we have just derived, also applies, with minor modifications, to things other than closed containers: that is, to 'open' membranes and fabrics which have to sustain pressure from the free movement of wind or water. Of such a nature are tents and kites and awnings and fabric-covered aircraft and parachutes and the sails of ships and windmills and eardrums and fishes' fins and the wings of bats and pterodactyls and the sails of the jellyfish called Portuguese men-of-war.

For all such purposes it is expedient and economical (as we shall see in Chapter 14) not to use a 'rigid' panel or shell or monocoque but to cover a stiff open framework of rods or spars or bones with some kind of flexible fabric or skin or membrane. Such a structure cannot be quite rigid, and it will be realized that, as soon as any lateral force comes upon the membrane by reason of the pressure of wind or water, it must deflect or bow into a curved shape which, to a first approximation, may be treated as a part or segment of a sphere or cylinder, and so the stresses in the membrane will obey much the same laws as those in the shell of a pressure vessel.

From this it is very easy to show that the force or tension in the membrane, per unit width, is pr, the product of the wind pressure (p) and the radius of curvature (r) of the membrane. Thus the more sharply the membrane is curved the less the force in it will be, and so the load which it puts upon the supporting framework will also be diminished.

When the wind blows, the pressure caused by the wind increases as the square of the wind velocity. In a strong wind the pressure becomes very high indeed and so do the loads upon the supporting structure. According to our Western, engineering-school, way of thinking there is very little we can do about this, for we would rather be seen dead than allow the membrane – whether it be a sail or part of an aeroplane or whatever – to bulge appreciably between its supports. Of course, we can never manage to keep the fabric perfectly flat, but we do everything we can to keep it as taut as possible. What we actually do is to make the supporting framework strong and heavy and expensive and hope that it won't break – which of course it often does.

For instance, the rig which has been developed for modern racing yachts generally consists of tubular metal spars and almost inextensible Terylene sails. This aerodynamic mechanism is kept up to its job by many ropes and wires which, in turn, are tautened to a frightening degree by means of screws and winches and hydraulic jacks, all of which are needed to cope with the enormous loads set up in the sails when the vessel is sailing fast in a breeze of wind. The whole thing is a miracle of engineering 'efficiency' but it is also horribly expensive. Ships of this sort convey to their occupants a feeling of tenseness which is anything but restful.

A simpler and cheaper way of doing the job is to arrange for the sail to bulge between its supports so that, as the wind pressure increases, the radius of curvature diminishes, and so the tension force in the canvas remains roughly constant however hard the winds may blow. Naturally, one has to ensure that the distortions which help to ease the structural problem do not create aerodynamic ones.

Figure 7. Chinese junk rig.

One elegant and satisfactory way of doing this has been devised by the Chinese, who, after all, have been sailing about the seas in moderate comfort and safety for a good many centuries. The rig of the traditional Chinese junk varies according to local custom but is generally very much like Figure 7. The battens which cross the sails are attached to the masts and, since the whole rig is constructed from flexible materials, as the wind increases, the sail bows out between the battens after the fashion of Figure 8 without much loss of aerodynamic efficiency. If it doesn't bulge enough it is quite simple to ease the halyard until it does. Lately, Colonel 'Blondie' Hasler (of Bordeaux Raid fame) has taken up the Chinese lug sail with very satisfactory results. Several yachts with Colonel Hasler's rig have made long ocean voyages with success and in a comparatively relaxed manner. The 'hang-gliders' which are now so popular are designed on much the same principles, and, although they may shock the traditionalists, they are cheap and strong and they do seem to work.

## 6.5 Bats and pterodactyls

Take from the goblin his crinkly face,

His pointed ears from the gnome;

Borrow the nose of a leprechaun

And smuggle it carefully home;

Sew bawkie fingers to banshee wrist;

Stitch gossamer vellum between;

Fit legs to straddle with knees atwist

From a body of velveteen.

Douglas English (Punchy 11 July 1923)

The resemblance between a bat and a Chinese junk is immediately obvious (Figure 9). In all bats the wings are constructed by stretching a membrane of very flexible skin over a framework of long, thin bones which are, in essence, the fingers of a hand, Fruit-bats, for instance, are quite large animals with a wing-span of four feet or something over a metre. In their native India, where they are a pest, they think nothing of flying thirty or forty miles in a night in order to rob an orchard. Since they can do this without becoming unduly exhausted they must therefore be efficient flying machines. Furthermore, to save weight, as well as what is called 'metabolic cost', they have gone a long way in the matter of cutting down the thickness of their wing-bones.

Figure 9. The fruit-bat.

When a fruit-bat is photographed in flight it can be seen that, on the down-stroke of the wing, the skin membrane bulges upwards into a form which is roughly semi-circular, thereby minimizing the mechanical load upon its bones. It is clear that there can in practice be little or no aerodynamic loss as a consequence of this change of shape.

About 30,000,000 years ago the place of birds was largely filled by a wide range of flying creatures called Pterodactyls (finger-wings). Many of these much resembled bats, except that only one finger, the little finger, played any structural part. So the membrane wing of pterodactyls was rather like a Bermuda mainsail without any battens.

Figure 10. Pteranodon.

Some of these animals were very large. Fossil remains of Pteranodon, for instance, have been recovered which show that this beast reached a wing-span of 8 metres (27 feet) and possibly more. It stood about 3 metres high (10 feet), and it seems that its total weight was probably only about 20 kilograms (44 lb.). There was therefore little weight available either for bony structure or for flying muscles. Recently, the discovery of even larger pterodactyls, about twice the span of Pteranodon, has been reported from America.

Pteranodon was probably pelagic: that is to say, it filled, roughly speaking, the ecological niche which is now occupied by the albatross. Like the albatross, it seems to have lived mostly in the air, soaring close above the deep-sea waves and fishing on the wing. Even more than the fruit-bat, the wing bones of Ptetanodon appear, from the fossils, to have been almost unbelievably thin and fragile. Of course, we know nothing experimentally about the elasticity of the skin which covered these vast wings, but it seems fair to infer that this skin must have behaved very much like that of a bat. The aerodynamic efficiency of the whole system must have been high and comparable to that of the modern albatross.

Why do birds have feathers?

Although bats flourish and survive very well today, pterodactyls were superseded by birds, which have feathers, a great many years ago. It is possible, of course, that the extinction of pterodactyls had nothing to do with structural considerations, but it is also possible that there is something special about feathers which gives birds an edge over other flying creatures. When I worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment I used to ask my superiors, from time to time, whether it would not perhaps be better if aeroplanes had feathers; but I seldom succeeded in extracting a rational or even a patient answer to this question.

But, after all, why do birds have feathers? Given the job of designing a flying animal, a modern engineer would perhaps produce something like a bat, or possibly some sort of flying insect. I do not think that it would occur to him to invent feathers. Yet presumably there are very good reasons for their existence. One imagines that both bats and pterodactyls tend to lose a good deal of energy in the form of heat from the skin of their wings; but then reasonable heat insulation could be provided by fur.

Perhaps this is what did happen at an early stage in the evolution of birds, because feathers, like horns and claws, developed from hair. However, hair is presumably better when it is soft, and so the keratin from which hair is made has quite a low Young's modulus. In feathers the keratin molecule has been made stiffer by cross-linking the molecular chains with sulphur atoms (which accounts for the smell of burnt feathers).

There are, no doubt, aerodynamic advantages in using feathers, since their employment extends the choice of outside shapes which the animal can make use of. For one thing, 'thick' wing-sections have often better aerodynamic efficiencies than the thin ones which result from membranes. It is easy to get an efficient 'thick' section by padding out the wing profile with feathers at the cost of very little weight increase. Furthermore, feathers are better adapted than skin and bone for providing anti-stalling devices such as' slots' and' flaps'.

However, I am inclined to think that the main advantage of feathers to an animal may be structural. Anybody who has flown model aeroplanes knows, to their cost, how vulnerable any small flying machine must be to accidental damage from things like trees and bushes, or even from careless handling. Many birds fly constantly in and out of trees and hedges and other obstacles. Indeed they use such cover as a refuge from their enemies. For most birds the loss of a reasonable number of feathers is not a very serious matter. Besides, it is better to leave the cat with a mouthful of feathers than to be eaten.

Feathers not only enable birds to get away with more local scrapes and abrasions than other animals, but the body of the bird is protected from more serious damage by its thick resilient armour. The Japanese feather armour which one sees in museums was not, as one might suppose, the picturesque nonsense of a primitive people who did not know any better. It was an effective protection against weapons like swords. In the same kind of way, during the Russo-Finnish war, Finnish armoured trains were protected by bales of paper; and modern fighter-pilots' splinter-proof boots are made from many layers of Cellophane. When a hawk kills a bird in the air it does not usually do so by wounding it with its beak or talons – which would probably not penetrate the feathers. It kills by striking the bird in the back with its outstretched feet so as to impart a violent acceleration to the bird as a whole which has the effect of breaking its neck – very much as happens in judicial hanging.

The whole constitution and design of feathers seem to be extremely cunning. Feathers probably do not need to be especially strong, but they do need to be stiff and at the same time resilient and to have a high work of fracture. The work of fracture mechanism of feathers is something of a mystery; at the time of writing I do not think anybody knows how it works. Like so many work of fracture mechanisms, that of feathers is sensitive to what appear to be small changes. Everybody who has kept and flown hawks knows that these intelligent, exacting and maddening birds lpse condition very easily. Even when they are properly fed and exercised in captivity, hawks' feathers are very apt to become brittle and break off with undue frequency. The cure or palliative for this is to join the broken parts of the feather together again by 'imping*. This is done by inserting a double-ended 'imping-needle', with a little glue, inside the hollow of the shaft at the break. The details of this process are described in the sixteenth-century books on hawking.

When one considers the appalling and expensive frequency with which motor cars nowadays incur bumps, bashes and abrasions, one sometimes wonders whether they have not a lesson to learn from the birds. Incidentally, I am told that, since the American army practically lives on chicken, there exist somewhere in the United States enormous quantities of unwanted chicken feathers. It would be rather nice to find a use for them.

p = density of material from which string is made (kg/m3)

s = tensile stress in string (N/m2).

And here I want to tell you a story about a ship that was madeduring the war. She wasa steamer, and she was built of wood – good wood; and the men who designed her were good and able craftsmen too...

She went along like a man who carries too heavy a burden, and presently she tripped and stumbled (it was only a little ground-swell) – and she opened out and fell apart like a flimsy old crate that someone had stepped on. In five minutes there was nothing there at all except a floating scum of coal dust, with some timbers and an odd man or two bobbing about in the middle of it.

This is a true story; but the point I want you to notice is that this ship was made by carpenters: house carpenters – shore carpenters; and she was not built by shipwrights at all.



管道与压力容器

植物和动物在很大程度上可被视为由许多管和囊组成的系统，这些管和囊的功能是存储和输送各种液体和气体。生物系统内部的压力通常不是很高，但也不能对其视而不见，活体的脉管和膜一旦发生爆裂，常常会造成致命的后果。

在技术层面，提供可靠的压力容器是晚近的成就，而我们极少会停下来想一想如果不使用管道会怎么样。由于缺乏能在压力作用下输送液体的管道，罗马人不得不付出巨大的代价在高拱上用砖石砌筑沟渠，以达到在山区用明渠横跨数英里送水的目的。最早出现的近似耐压密闭容器是枪管，在历史上，这些枪管从不让人省心，经常炸膛。因枪管炸膛而丧生的人员名单长到触目惊心的程度，最早可追溯至苏格兰国王詹姆斯二世。尽管如此，1800 年后不久，当伦敦开始安装煤气灯时，煤气管道仍不得不由伯明翰的枪械工匠来制造。事实上，最早的煤气管道确实是用步枪枪管一节接一节地焊接起来制成的。

虽然关于蒸汽机的历史记载多到数不清，但关于管道和锅炉发展的记述则比较少，它们是蒸汽机的基础，在现实中制造它们比制造一台机器更困难。最早的蒸汽机既笨重又庞大，还要耗费大量燃料，这主要是因为它们需在非常低的蒸汽压力下工作 —— 鉴于当代锅炉的性质，这或许不成问题。

制造轻便、结实或者说经济实惠的蒸汽机完全取决于对较高工作压力的应用。在 19 世纪 20 年代的蒸汽轮船上，蒸气压力约为 10 psi（由四四方方的「草垛形」锅炉提供），煤炭消耗量约为 15 磅 / 马力小时（1 马力小时≈2.7×106 焦）。19 世纪 50 年代，工程师谈论的仍是 20 psi 大小的压力和约 9 磅 / 马力小时的消耗量。到 1900 年，压力已增加到 200 psi 以上，而煤炭消耗量已降至 1.5 磅 / 马力小时，是 80 年前的 1/10。这样看来，让帆船驶出外海的不是蒸汽轮船，而是高压蒸汽轮船，它装有三联式蒸汽机、「苏格兰式」锅炉，具备燃料成本低和航程长的性能。

高压锅炉的开发不是一帆风顺的。在 19 世纪的大部分时间里，锅炉爆炸比较频繁，后果有时非常可怕，尤其是美式内河蒸汽轮船，成为高压条件下运行的先驱。19 世纪中叶，密西西比河上的蒸汽艇常常在数千英里的河面上你追我赶。这些压力容器的设计者都不惜一切代价来提速和减重，他们对锅炉采取了一种堪称乐观的设计办法。结果，1859—1860 年，有 27 艘船因锅炉爆炸而报废。[3]

虽然其中有些事故可归因于像锁死安全阀这样的犯罪行为，但大部分主要是由于缺乏适当的计算。这是个遗憾，因为要确定简单压力容器内的应力，所需的基本计算其实非常容易，以至于据我所知，从来没有人劳神去追索它们的优先权问题，运算只需要最基础的代数知识。[4]

球形压力容器

一旦我们开始考虑任意种类的压力容器或器具，包括气球、囊、胃、管道、锅炉和动脉等，我们就需要处理同时在多个方向上起作用的拉应力。这听起来可能很复杂，但事实上你不用担心。任何压力容器的外皮其实都具备两项功能。它必须依靠其水密性或气密性来容纳流体，还需要承受内压引起的应力。这些外皮或外壳几乎总在承受其所在平面上的双向作用的拉应力，即与其表面平行的拉应力。第三个方向上的应力垂直于其表面，通常极小，可以忽略不计。

为方便计，让我们先看看圆球形状的压力容器。假设图 6–1 中囊状物体的外壁或外壳相当薄，比如不到其直径的 1/10。从球心到外壁厚度的中间为球壳半径，记为 r。外壁或外壳的厚度为 t，整体受内部流体压强为 p（所有这些物理量的单位碰巧都是我们用过的）。

试想我们将这个东西切成两半，像一个葡萄柚，那么图 6–1、图 6–2 和图 6–3 相当清晰地展示了壳上的应力（在平行于其表面的全部方向上），就是：

这是一个有实用价值的结果，事实上也是一个标准的工程公式。

图 6–1 球形容器，其内部压强为 p，平均半径为 r，壁厚为 t

图 6–2 试想将该容器沿任一直径切成两半。作用在每个半球壳内部的所有压力的合力，一定等于作用在切面上的所有应力之和，切面面积为 2πrt

图 6–3 作用于半球曲面内部的所有压力的合力等于作用在等直径平面圆盘上的相同压力，该压力肯定为 πr2p。因此有：

圆柱形压力容器

球形容器有其用途，但圆柱形容器显然应用更广泛，尤其是管和筒等。圆柱体的表面不像球体表面那样对称，故而我们不能假定圆柱壳的纵向应力与周向应力相同；事实上，它们的确不一样。我们设圆柱壳的纵向应力为 s1，周向应力为 s2。

由图 6–4 我们可以看到，圆柱壳的纵向应力 s1 肯定和前文的球壳应力一样，也就是说：

要得到 s2，即圆柱壳的周向应力，我们可以自己想象按图 6–5 所示沿另一平面切开圆柱。由此我们可知：

因此，圆柱形压力容器外壳的周向应力是其纵向应力的两倍，即 s2=2s1（见图 6–6）。每一个煎炸过香肠的人肯定会观察到其中的一个后果：当香肠的内馅膨胀而肠衣爆裂时，裂缝总是纵向的。换言之，导致香肠肠衣破裂的是周向应力，而非纵向应力。

这些算术不断出现在工程学和生物学领域，它们常被用来计算管道、锅炉、气球、充气屋顶、火箭和太空飞船的强度。我们将在第 8 章看到，同样简单的理论也适用于从阿米巴虫式的生命形态发展到延展性更强且行动更自如的原始生物的一系列问题。

我们刚才做的代数运算的另一个结果是，要在给定压力下容纳给定体积的流体，用圆柱形容器比用球形容器所需的材料更重。在重量因素非常重要的情境下 —— 像登山者在高海拔地区使用的氧气瓶以及飞机起动机瓶 —— 球形容器是很常见的。对大多数其他用途来说，重量则不那么重要，而且圆柱形瓶更便宜也更方便。医院和汽修厂里使用的高压气瓶就是个很好的例子。

图 6–4 圆柱形压力容器外壳的纵向应力 s1 同等效球形容器外壳的应力一样：

中式工程学的智慧

每艘帆船的设计者都必须解决一个有趣的问题：防止船上桅杆折断落水的最好方法是什么？人们关于这个问题的看法是有分歧的，可分为两个流派：东方派和西方派。西方派认为让桅杆维持在船上的最好办法是用横桅索和支索组成的复杂系统来固定。东方派则认为这些都毫无意义，而且很贵；他们的做法是竖立一根摇摇晃晃的高大桅杆，上面挂上大块的麻布垫子、竹席或俯拾可得的其他东西，然后依靠信仰的力量维持桅杆的直立。反正在这样的奇迹里，我从未发现任何其他力量的加入。

—— 威斯顿·马特（Weston Martyr），

《南太水手》（The Southseaman）

我们刚才推导的压力容器理论，稍做修正，也适用于除密闭容器以外的其他东西，即「敞开」的膜和织物，它们需要承受风或水的自由流动带来的压力。这类东西可见于帐篷、风筝、帐幕、织物覆盖的飞机、降落伞、船帆、风车、耳膜、鱼鳍、蝙蝠和翼手龙的翅膀，以及葡萄牙战舰水母的帆状膜冠。

就所有这些用途而论，便利又经济的办法（见第 14 章）不是使用「刚性」的面板、外壳或单壳式构造，而是用某种柔韧的织物、外皮或膜覆盖住由杆、圆木或骨构成的强劲开放框架。这样的结构刚性不能太强，它需要实现下述功能，即一旦有来自风压或水压的任何侧向力作用于膜上，它就必须挠变或凹陷为弯曲的形状，在一阶近似下，可视之为球体或圆柱的一部分，因此膜上应力遵循的规律同压力容器外壳上的几乎一样。

由此我们可以很容易地揭示出单位宽度的膜上作用力或张力为 pr，即风压（p）和覆膜曲率半径（r）的乘积。因此，膜弯曲得越厉害，膜上的作用力就越小，施于支撑框架的载荷也会减少。

当风吹起来时，风产生的压力随风速的平方而增加。在强风情况下，压力确实变得非常大，施于支撑结构的载荷也是一样。按西方工程学派的思维方式，我们对此无能为力，因为我们宁死也不愿让覆膜 —— 不管是船帆或飞机的一部分，还是其他东西 —— 在其支撑物之间明显鼓起来。当然，我们永远无法让织物保持完全平整，但我们能想方设法让它尽可能保持紧绷。实际上，我们可以做的事情就是使支撑框架变强、变重和变贵，并希望它不会断裂 —— 当然，往往事与愿违。

例如，现代赛艇的帆桅装置通常是由管状金属桅杆和几乎不可伸展的涤纶帆组成的。这种空气动力的机械结构是靠许多绳和线来保持运作的，这些绳和线被依次用旋钮、摇柄和液压千斤顶拧得紧紧的，以应对船在微风中快速航行时作用在帆上的巨大载荷。这堪称工程「效率」的一个奇迹，但它也贵得吓人。这种类型的船舶给他们的乘坐者传递了一种绝非安逸的紧张感。

一种更简单也更廉价的工作方式是，让船帆在它的支撑物之间鼓起来。这样一来，随风压的增长，曲率半径会减小，无论风吹得多么猛烈，帆布上的张力也会大致保持不变。当然，人们必须确保这种有助于缓解结构性难题的变形不会导致空气动力方面的问题。

中国人想出了一种优雅且令人满意的解决办法，毕竟他们以较为舒适安全的方式在海上航行了数个世纪。对于传统中式平底帆船的帆桅装置，各地的样式有所不同，但大体上都如图 6–7 所示。横跨船帆的板条依附于桅杆上，因为整个帆桅装置都是由柔性材料制成的；随着风力的增强，板条间的船帆按图 6–8 所示的方式鼓起来而不会损失太多的空气动力效率。如果鼓起不够，放松帆绳便能轻而易举地办到。赫伯特·哈斯勒（Herbert Hasler）上校因「二战」期间领导波尔多突袭战而闻名，近来他采用中式四角纵帆取得了令人满意的结果，几艘装配这种帆桅装置的赛艇以比较轻松的方式完成了远洋航行。如今十分流行的「悬挂式滑翔机」也是基于几乎同样的原理设计的，虽然它们可能会让因循守旧者感到震惊，但它们既便宜又强劲，似乎还很有效。

蝙蝠与翼手龙的结构

夺走精灵褶皱的脸，

拿走侏儒尖尖的耳；

借来矮妖精的鼻子，

偷偷把它带回家；

弯曲的手指缝到女妖的腕上；

薄薄的牛皮纸点缀其间；

叉开的腿，扭动的膝盖，

在棉绒身子上装起来。

—— 道格拉斯·英格利希（Douglas English），

出自《笨拙》杂志

显然，蝙蝠和中式平底帆船有很多相似之处（见图 6–9）。对所有蝙蝠来说，翅膀的构成都是通过拉伸柔性皮肤膜覆盖细长骨骼组成的框架，这些骨骼本质上就是手指。例如，像果蝠这种相当大的蝙蝠，它们的翼展可达到 4 英尺（超过 1 米）。在其原产地印度，它们是一种有害的动物，能轻而易举地一夜奔袭三四十英里，去洗劫一处果园。它们能毫不费力地做到这一点，因此是一种高效的飞行机器。此外，为了节省重量和所谓的「代谢成本」，它们在削减翼骨粗度方面也走得很远。

图 6–9 果蝠

从一只正在飞行的果蝠的拍摄画面可以看出，在俯冲过程中，它的翅膀上的皮肤膜向上鼓起，呈大致的半球形状，从而将骨骼承受的机械载荷降到最低。显然，在实践中，这种形状改变极少甚至不会造成空气动力的损失。

大约 3 000 万年前，鸟类的地盘主要被翼手龙类飞行生物占据。其中许多长得很像蝙蝠，除了只有一个指头的那些，其小指发挥了整个结构的作用。所以，翼手龙的膜状翅膀有点儿像不带任何板条的百慕大式主帆。

这种动物中有一些体形巨大。例如，修复后的无齿翼龙化石表明这种野兽的翼展可达 8 米（27 英尺），甚至可能更大。它站立时约有 3 米高（10 英尺），但总重量可能仅为 20 千克（44 磅）左右。因此，骨架结构或飞行肌肉所占的重量极小。最近，据来自美国的报道，更大的翼龙化石被发现了，其翼展约为无齿翼龙的两倍。

图 6–10 无齿翼龙

无齿翼龙可能是一种海洋动物，也就是说，它所在的生态位跟今天的信天翁大致相同。像信天翁一样，它似乎主要在半空活动，贴着海洋的波涛翱翔，在飞行过程中捕鱼。从化石可以看出，无齿翼龙的翼骨几乎令人难以置信地既细又脆，甚于果蝠。当然，我们无法实测覆盖在这些巨大翅膀上的皮肤弹性，但似乎可以合理推测这种皮肤的表现肯定很像蝙蝠。整个系统的空气动力效率一定很高，可与现代的信天翁媲美。

为什么鸟类会有羽毛？

虽然蝙蝠存活至今且种群兴盛，但在很多年前，翼手龙就被长羽毛的鸟类取代了。当然，翼手龙的灭绝可能与结构性因素无关，但也有可能是因为羽毛有些特殊之处，让鸟类比其他飞行生物更具生存优势。我在英国皇家航空研究院工作期间时常问我的上级，如果飞机有羽毛会不会更好，但我很少能得到理性甚至是耐心的回答。

但是，到底为什么鸟类会有羽毛呢？如果要承担设计飞行动物的任务，现代工程师或许会制造出像蝙蝠一样的东西，也可能是某种会飞的昆虫。但我认为他们可能不会去发明羽毛，虽然羽毛的存在也有很好的理由。可以想象，蝙蝠和翼手龙都倾向于通过它们的翅膀皮肤以热量的形式损失大量能量，但皮毛可以起到适当的隔热作用。

或许这就是鸟类进化早期发生的事情，因为羽毛像角和爪一样，都是从毛发发展而来。但是，毛发以软为宜，所以构成毛发的角蛋白具有相当低的杨氏模量。在羽毛中，角蛋白分子通过分子链与硫原子的联系（这解释了羽毛烧焦散发的气味）变得更强劲。

毫无疑问，羽毛会带来空气动力方面的优势，因为它们的使用扩展了动物可用外形的选择范围。一方面，厚的翼截面通常比膜构成的薄翼截面具备更好的空气动力效率。靠羽毛填充增加翼的轮廓，很容易得到一个高效的厚截面，而代价只是重量的略微增加。另一方面，羽毛比皮肤和骨骼更适合提供「翼缝」「襟翼」等防失速装置。

然而，我倾向于认为羽毛给动物带来的主要优势可能是结构性的。任何开过模型飞机的人都知道，所有小型飞行器都比较容易受损，比如，乔木和灌木及粗心的操作都会带来意外的损伤，这是他们不得不付出的代价。许多鸟类不断在树木、篱笆等障碍物间飞进飞出，其实是把它们当成躲避天敌的庇护所。对大部分鸟类来说，损伤适量的羽毛并不是十分严重的问题。而且，被猫扯掉些许羽毛总比被吃掉好。

与其他动物相比，羽毛不仅能帮助鸟类避免更多的局部擦伤和磨损，还能使鸟的躯体受到厚的回弹性盔甲的保护，从而避免更严重的损伤。我们在博物馆里看到的日式羽毛甲胄，并非如人们想象的那样，仅是一个不懂审美的原始民族华而不实的追求。其实，它对刀剑等武器起到了有效的防护作用。同理，在苏芬战争期间，芬兰的装甲列车用捆扎起来的纸作为防护；现代战斗机飞行员的防裂靴则是由多层玻璃纸制成的。当鹰在空中捕杀鸟时，鹰通常不会用喙或爪伤害鸟，因为鹰可能无法刺穿鸟的羽毛。鹰通常是伸出脚击打鸟的后背，导致鸟猛烈地加速，以致脖子被折断，很像实施绞刑时发生的情况。

羽毛的整体构造和设计似乎极其巧妙。羽毛可能不需要特别强劲，但它们又确实需要有一定的刚度，还要有回弹性和很大的断裂功。羽毛的断裂功机制尚属未解之谜；在撰写本书时，我认为仍然没有人知道它是如何运作的。像很多断裂功机制一样，羽毛的断裂功对看似微小的变化很敏感。饲养和放飞过鹰的人都知道，这些聪明、精准和折磨人的鸟很容易掉毛。即便在被圈养时获得了适当的喂食和锻炼，鹰的羽毛仍然非常容易变脆，还会以过快的频率脱落。治愈或缓解该症状的方法是，以「拼接」的方式将羽毛的断裂部分再次连起来。具体办法是用双头「拼接针」蘸点儿胶水，插入羽轴断裂处的中空部位。对该过程的细节描述可参见 16 世纪那些关于养鹰术的书籍。

考虑到如今汽车遭遇颠簸、碰撞和刮擦的频率惊人且代价昂贵，人们有时会想这是否源于他们没有从鸟类身上吸取经验教训。顺便说一下，我听说，由于美军几乎靠鸡肉为生，所以在美国的某处存有巨量无用的鸡毛。若它们有了用武之地，岂不美哉？
