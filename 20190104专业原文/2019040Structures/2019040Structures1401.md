John Selden (1584–1654)

As we have seen, very much the commonest day-to-day practical use of structural theory is in analysing the behaviour of some specific structure: either one which it is proposed to build, one which is actually in existence but whose safety is in question, or else one which has, rather embarrassingly, already collapsed. In other words, if we know the dimensions of a given structure and the properties of the materials from which it is made, we can at least try to predict how strong it ought to be and how much it will deflect. However, although calculations of this sort are clearly very useful in particular instances, this kind of approach is only of limited help to us when we want to understand why things are the shape they are or when we want to choose which, out of several different classes of structure, would be best for a particular service. For instance, in making an aeroplane or a bridge, would it be better to use a continuous shell structure made from plates or panels or else a criss-cross lattice arrangement built up from rods or tubes and braced, perhaps, with wires? Again, why do we have so many muscles and tendons and comparatively few bones? Furthermore, how is the engineer ever to select from the large variety of materials which are usually available? Should he make his structure from steel or aluminium, from plastic or from wood?

The ‘design' of plants and animals and of the traditional artefacts did not just happen. As a rule both the shape and the materials of any structure which has evolved over a long period of time in a competitive world represent an optimization with regard to the loads which it has to carry and to the financial or the metabolic cost. We should like to achieve this sort of optimization in modern technology; but we are not always very good at it.

It is not widely realized that this subject, which is sometimes called the ‘philosophy of design', can be studied in a scientific way. This is a pity, because the results are important, both in biology and in engineering. Although not much regarded, the study of the philosophy of design has, in fact, been going on for quite a number of years. The first serious engineering approach to the subject was made by A. G. M. Michell around 1900.* Though biologists had been making remarks about the ‘square-cube law' (Chapter 9) practically since it was propounded by Galileo, it was not until 1917 that Sir D'Arcy Thompson published his beautiful book On Growth and Form (still in print), which was the first general account of the influence of structural requirements on the shapes of plants and animals. For all its many virtues, the book is not a very numerate one, and the engineering views expressed are not always sound. Though greatly, and justly, praised, Growth and Form did not have much real influence on biological thinking, either in its own time or for long afterwards. It does not seem to have influenced engineers very much either, no doubt because the time for an interaction between biological and engineering thought was not ripe.

In recent years the chief exponent of the mathematical study of the philosophy of structures has been H. L. Cox. Besides being a distinguished elastician, Mr Cox has the additional merit of being an expert on Beatrix Potter. I hope that he will forgive me for saying that he is in some ways a little like the great Thomas Young. For he shares not only something of Young's genius, but also a good deal of Young's obscurity of presentation. I am afraid lesser mortals often find Cox's expositions difficult to follow without the aid of an evangelist or interpreter. This may account for the fact that his work has received less attention than it deserves. Much of what follows is based on Cox, directly or indirectly. Let us begin with his analysis of tension structures.

The design of tension structures

It is a curiosity of engineering design that it is impossible to fashion a simple tension member without first devising some end fitting through which the load may be applied; and whether the material be wrought-iron or liana, wire rope or string, the stress system in the end fitting is a great deal more complicated than simple tension. There is plenty of scope for theory in the design of tension end fittings, but there is also a great deal of experience; and whether the competition is from the ancient pygmies' mastery of the craft of making knots in lianas, or from Brunei's development of efficient eye bars, experience will often dictate the design. Still the theorist has the final word.

H. L. Cox, The Design of Structures of Least Weight (Pergamon, 1965)

If we did not have to consider the effect of end fittings the philosophy of tension structures would be very simple indeed. For one thing, the weight of a tension structure, fitted to carry a given load, would be proportional to its length. That is to say, a rope strong enough to carry a load of one ton over a distance of one hundred metres would weigh just a hundred times as much as a rope safe to carry the same load over one metre. Furthermore, provided that the load were evenly shared, it would make no difference whether a given load were supported by one single rope or tie-bar, or by two ropes or bars each having half the cross-section.

This simple view is upset by the necessity for end fittings: that is to say, by the need to get the load in at one end of the member and out at the other. Even an ordinary rope will need a knot or a splice at each end. The knot or splice will be relatively heavy and may cost money. If we are to do an honest reckoning this weight and cost will have to be added to that of the bare tension member itself. The weight and the cost of the end fittings will be just the same, for a given load, whether the rope be long or short. Thus, other things being equal, the weight and cost of a tension member per unit length will be less for a long member than for a short one. In other words the weight is not directly proportional to the length.

Again, it can be shown, from the algebra and geometry of such a system, that the total weight of the end fittings of two tension bars, operating in parallel, is less than that of the end fittings of a single rope or bar of equivalent cross-section.* It follows that, in general, weight is saved by subdividing a tensile load between two or more tension members instead of carrying it in a single one.

As Cox points out, the stress distribution in end fittings is always complex and must include more or less severe stress concentrations, from which cracks will spread if they get the chance. Thus both the weight and the cost of the fittings will depend both upon the skill of the designer and also upon the toughness – that is to say, the work of fracture – of the material. The higher the work of fracture, the lighter and the cheaper the fitting will be. However, as we saw in Chapter 5, toughness is likely to diminish as tensile strength increases. In the case of common engineering metals, like steel, the work of fracture falls dramatically with increase of tensile strength.

Thus in choosing a material for a tension member we are commonly faced with incompatible requirements. To reduce the weight of the middle or parallel part of a tie-bar we should like to use a material of high tensile strength. For the end fittings we generally want a tough material – which is only too likely to imply the acceptance of a low tensile strength. Like many difficulties, this one must be solved by a compromise, which in this case depends chiefly on the length of the member. For very long members, such as the wire cables of a modern suspension bridge, it will generally pay to choose a high tensile steel, even if we have to accept extra weight and complication in connection with the end fittings at the anchorages of the cables. After all, there are only two of these, one at each end of the bridge, while there is perhaps a mile of wire in between. Thus the saving of weight over the middle part will more than compensate for any losses at the ends.

But when we come to things like chains with shortish links, the situation is totally different. In each short link the weight of the end fittings may well be greater than that of the middle part and must be carefully considered. This is the case with the supporting chains of the older suspension bridges. Such things were generally made from a tough and ductile wrought iron of quite low tensile strength. As we said in Chapter 10, the tensile stress in the plate links of Telford's Menai bridge chains is less than a tenth of that in the wires of a modern suspension bridge – for this excellent reason. Very similar arguments apply to shell structures such as ships and tanks and boilers and girders which are fabricated from comparatively small plates of iron or steel. It also applies to riveted aluminium structures, such as conventional aircraft. All these may be considered more or less as two-dimensional chains with rather small links. In such cases it pays to use a weaker but more ductile material; otherwise the weight of the joints would be prohibitive (see Chapter 5, Figure 13, p. 106).

The multiplication of ropes and wires in ships and biplanes and tents generally results in a saving, rather than an increase, of weight.* Naturally, all this cat's-cradle business incurs the penalty of high wind resistance, high maintenance costs and general complication. This is the price we may have to pay for low structure weight. A similar principle can be seen in animals, where Nature does not hesitate to multiply tension members such as muscles and tendons. Indeed she adopts the same device as the Elizabethan seamen to reduce the weight of end attachments. The ends of many tendons are splayed out into a fan-shaped contrivance which Sir Francis Drake would have called a ‘crowsfoot'. Each branch of the tendon has a separate little joint to the bone. Thus the weight (and perhaps the metabolic cost) is minimized.

The relative weights of tension and compression structures

As we saw in the last chapter, the breaking stresses in tension and in compression for a given solid are often different, but for many common materials, such as steel, the difference is not very great, and so the weights of short tension and compression members are likely to be fairly similar. In fact, because a compression member may not need to have heavy end fittings – whereas a tension member does – a short compression strut may well be lighter, for comparable conditions, than a tension bar.

However, as a strut gets longer, Dr Euler begins to make himself felt. It will be remembered that the buckling load of a long column varies as l/L2 (where L is the length) and this implies that, for a rod of constant cross-section, the compressive strength diminishes very rapidly with increase of length. Thus, to support any given load, a long strut has to be made very much thicker, and therefore heavier, than a short one. As we said in the last section, the same consideration does not apply to tension members.

It is revealing to study the problem of carrying one ton (1,000 kg or 10,000 Newtons) over a distance of 10 metres (33 feet) first in tension and then in compression.

IN TENSION. For a steel rod or a cable we might allow a working stress of, say, 330 MN/m2 or 50,000 p.s.i. in tension. Taking into account the end fittings, the total weight comes out at about 3-5 kg or about 8 lb.

IN COMPRESSION. To try to carry such a load in compression over such a distance by means of a solid steel rod would be silly, because if a solid rod were thick enough to avoid buckling it would need to be very heavy indeed. In practice we might well use a steel tube, which would have to be about 16 cm (6 inches) in diameter with a wall-thickness of, say, 5 mm (0-2 inch). Such a tube would weigh 200 kg or about 450 lb. In other words it would weigh between fifty and sixty times as much as the tension rod. The cost might well be in the same proportion. Furthermore, if we should want to subdivide a compression structure the situation gets not better but much worse. If we wanted to support a load of one ton, not by a single strut, but by some table-like arrangement of four struts, each 10 metres long, then the total weight of the struts would be twice as great: that is to say, 400 kg or 900 lb. The weight goes on increasing the more the structure is subdivided – in fact as √n̄ where n is the number of columns. (See Appendix 4.)

On the other hand, if we increase the load, keeping the distance the same, then the weight of a compression structure becomes relatively better. For instance, if we increase the load a hundredfold, that is, from one ton to 100 tons, then, though the weight of a tension member has gone up at least in proportion from 3-5 kg to 350 kg, yet the weight of a single strut to carry this load over 10 metres increases only tenfold, that is, from about 200 kg to about 2,000 kg. So, in compression, it is proportionately very much more economical to support a heavy load than a light one (Figure 1). All these considerations operate in the same sort of way for panels and shells and plates and membranes as for simple struts and poles and columns (Appendix 4).

Figure 1. Diagram illustrating the relative weight-cost of carrying a given load over a distance L.

Considerations of this kind provide the rationale of things like tents and sailing ships. With such devices it pays, hands down, to collect the compression loads into a small number of masts or poles, contrived to be as short as possible. At the same time the tension loads, as we have said, are better diffused into as many strings and membranes as may be. Thus a bell-tent, which has a single pole but many guy-ropes, is likely to be the lightest ‘building' which can be made in proportion to its volume. However, almost any tent will generally be lighter and cheaper than a solid building made from timber or masonry. In the same way, a cutter or a sloop, which has a single mast, is a lighter and more efficient rig than a ketch or a schooner or any other more complicated arrangement with several masts. This is also the reason why the A-shaped or tripod masts used by the ancient Egyptians and by the designers of Victorian ironclads (Chapter 11) were heavy and inefficient.

Again, the typical vertebrate animal, such as man, is on the whole a good deal like a bell-tent or a sailing ship. There is a small number of compression members, that is, bones, more or less in the middle, and these are surrounded by a wilderness of muscles and tendons and membranes – even more complicated than the ropes and sails of a full-rigged ship – which carry the tensions. Furthermore, from the structural point of view two legs are better than four, and the centipede is perhaps only saved from total inadequacy by the fact that its legs are so short.

Scale effects – or second thoughts on the ‘square-cube law'

It will be remembered that, long ago, it occurred to Galileo that, whereas the weight of a structure increased as the cube of its dimensions, the cross-sectional area of its load-carrying members increased only as the square, and so the stress in the material of geometrically similar structures ought to increase in direct proportion to the dimensions. Thus a structure which is liable to fail by tensile fracture induced, directly or indirectly, by its own weight must be made of thicker and stockier proportions the larger it becomes. In fact, its members would have to be made disproportionately thicker and heavier than the simple rule would indicate, because there is a sort of ‘ compound interest' effect. Thus the size of all structures might be expected to be quite strictly limited.

This square-cube law has been bandied about by both biologists and engineers for a long time. Herbert Spencer and, later, D'Arcy Thompson said that it limited the size of animals, such as elephants, and engineers used to explain that it rendered impracticable the building of ships or aircraft appreciably larger than those already in existence. In spite of this, both ships and aircraft continued to get bigger and bigger.

As a matter of fact the square-cube law seems to apply with full force only to the lintels of Greek temples (which are made from weak, heavy stone), icebergs and icefloes (which are made from weak, heavy ice) and things like jellies and blancmanges.

As we have seen, in many sophisticated structures the weight of the compression members is likely to be many times greater than that of the tension parts. Since the compression members are likely to fail by buckling they will become more efficient the larger the load they are called upon to bear – that is to say, the larger the structure is made. For this reason, although there is a disproportionate increase of weight with increase of size, the penalty is very much smaller than is implied by the square-cube law. In practice this penalty may be more than offset by various ‘economies of scale'. For instance, in a ship or a fish, an aircraft or a bird, the resistance to motion will be nearly in the ratio of the surface area, and this area will diminish, proportionately to the weight, as the size increases. It was Brunei's perception of this which impelled him to design the Great Eastern. Brunei's perception was right, though his great ship was a failure, and this is why we build enormous ships, such as super-tankers, today. Furthermore, as we saw in Chapter 5 the size of large animals is more likely to be limited by considerations related to the ‘critical Griffith crack length' in their bones than by the square-cube law.

Space-frames versus monocoques

Quite frequently the engineer is faced with a choice between a lattice structure built up, Meccano-fashion, from separate struts and tension rods – which is called a ‘space-frame' – and a shell structure in which the load is carried in more or less continuous panels; this is called a ‘monocoque'. Sometimes the distinction between the two forms of construction is obscured by the fact that space-frames are covered over with some sort of continuous cladding which does not really carry much load. This is the case with traditional timbered cottages, with modern steel-framed sheds and barns (which are covered with corrugated iron) and, of course, with animals which are covered with shells or scales.

Sometimes the decision about which form to use is dictated by requirements which are not strictly structural. Thus an electricity pylon offers least wind resistance and least area of steel to paint when it is in the form of an open trellis or lattice tower. Again it is generally more convenient to make a water-tank, for instance, from a shell of thickish steel plates than in the form of a trellis supporting a water-tight bag or membrane, even though the latter form may be lighter and is, in fact, the solution usually adopted by Nature for stomachs and bladders.

Sometimes the difference in weight and cost between the two forms of construction is marginal and it may not matter very much which is used. In other cases the difference is very great. As we have seen, a tent is always much lighter and cheaper than any equivalent building made from continuous panels or concrete or masonry. In coachbuilding the old-fashioned ‘Weymann' saloon car body, circa 1930, which consisted of a wooden space-frame covered with padded fabric, was very much lighter than any of the pressed metal shell bodies which have been used since. In these days of expensive petrol the Weymann body might well be revived.

There is, however, an idea about that monocoque shells are somehow more ‘modern' and more advanced than space-frames, which are sometimes considered to be primitive and rather Heath Robinson. Although a good many engineers who ought to know better subscribe to this view, there is in fact no objective structural justification for it. When it comes to carrying loads which are primarily compressive, the space-frame is always lighter and usually cheaper than the monocoque. The weight penalty for using a monocoque, however, is less severe when the loads are high in relation to the dimensions, and this, in conjunction with other considerations, may justify the use of shells in some instances. However, for large, lightly loaded structures, such as ‘rigid' airships, the space-frame or trellis structure is the only practicable one. The alternative for lighter-than-air transport is not a vast monocoque airship made from an engineer's dream of shiny aluminium plates, but a pressurized bag or ‘blimp'.

The transition from the stick and string and fabric construction of the early aircraft to modern monocoques was not dictated by some sudden surge of fashion but was a strictly logical step in aircraft design once certain loads and speeds were reached. As we have said, regarded solely as a means of taking compression and bending, the monocoque is always heavier than the space-frame; but the extra weight required gets less in proportion as the load on the structure increases. On the other hand, regarded as a means of resisting shear and torsion, the monocoque is more efficient than the space-frame.* As aircraft speeds increase, so do the requirements for torsional strength and stiffness. There comes therefore a transition point, which was reached in the 1930s, when it pays, in terms of structure weight, to change over the construction of airframes from space-frame to monocoque. This is especially the case with monoplanes. Thus modern aircraft are usually built as continuous shells, using aluminium sheet, plywood or Fibreglass for the skin. We see an equally logical reversion to space-frame construction in modern hang-gliders, which are very light indeed.

The need to resist large torsional loads is almost confined to artificial structures such as ships and aircraft. As we said in Chapter 12, Nature nearly always manages to avoid torsion, and thus, at least as far as large animals are concerned, monocoques or exo-skeletons are uncommon. Most sizeable animals are vertebrates and therefore highly sophisticated and successful space-frames, not very different in their structural philosophy from biplanes and sailing ships. The avoidance of severe torsional requirements is very noticeable in birds and bats and pterodactyls. It is this which enabled these animals to retain their light space-frame construction when they took to the air. Aircraft designers, please note.

Blown-up structures

It is sometimes interesting to speculate about the technological ‘ifs' and ‘buts' of history. If Isambard Kingdom Brunei had come upon the railway scene a very few years earlier than he did it is probable that most of the railways of the world would have standardized on a gauge of 7 feet instead of using his rival George Stephenson's ‘coal wagon gauge' of 4 feet 8£ inches, which derived from the Roman chariots. The Stephenson gauge has proved something of a handicap, as Brunei predicted it would. If they had a wider gauge today, the railways might perhaps be in a stronger position, technically, and economically, than they are. If so, the world might be slightly different.

On the other hand, if an effective pneumatic tyre had been available around 1830, we might have gone direct to mechanical road transport without passing through the intervening stage of railways at all. In that case the present-day world would have been even more different. In fact the pneumatic tyre was invented about fifteen years too late. It was patented in 1845 by a young man called R. W. Thomson, then aged twenty-three. Thomson's tyre was surprisingly successful technically, but by that time the railways were well established, and the rail interests combined with the horse interests to promote absurd and restrictive legislation, which had the effect of delaying the development of the motor car until the turn of the century.

Since the bicycle was never thought to constitute a serious threat either to trains or to horses its development was legally permitted in Victorian times. The pneumatic tyre was revived with considerable success, for use on cycles, by J. B. Dunlop in 1888. Dunlop made a fortune out of it, but by that time Thomson was dead and his patent had expired. With solid tyres lorries are limited to something like 15 m.p.h., and cars cannot go very much faster. Thomson's invention has not only made fast and cheap road transport practicable; it has also enabled aircraft to operate from dry land. Without pneumatic tyres we should probably have to use some form of seaplane.

Tyres, of course, have the function of spreading and cushioning the load beneath the wheels of a vehicle, and in this they are extremely successful. However, tyres are really only one example of a whole class of blown-up structures. Quite apart from any cushioning effects, blown-up structures provide a very effective way of evading the serious penalties in weight and cost which are incurred when we try to carry light loads over a long distance in bending or in compression. What such a structure does is to carry the compression, not in a solid panel or column which is liable to buckle, but by compressing a fluid, such as air or water. Thus the solid parts have only to sustain tension forces, which, as we have seen, involve very much less weight and cost than compression.

In technology the idea of using blown-up structures in an intelligent way is not new. Around 1,000 B.C., the up-river boatmen of the Tigris and the Euphrates were making boats and rafts from blown-up animal skins. These boats voyaged down-stream carrying, not only produce for sale in the cities of the plains, but also mules or donkeys. On arrival at their destination, the skins were deflated and returned to their home-ports, overland, on the backs of the pack-animals. Nowadays pneumatic boats are common and so are pneumatic tents and furniture. They are often packed up and carried around on cars.

The air-supported roof was invented by the great engineer F. W. Lanchester in 1910. It consists simply of an inflatable membrane, attached at its edges to the ground. It is kept up by air at very low pressure provided by a simple fan arrangement. Although it has to be entered and left by means of an air-lock, this is not usually a very serious handicap in view of the other advantages. Lanchester's roof allows large areas to be covered very easily and cheaply, but its use is at present confined to things like greenhouses and covered tennis courts; it is prevented from being used for factories or houses by rather grandmotherly building regulations.

Of course, one does not have to use air. The sandbag is really another way of doing the same sort of thing, and so are ‘Dracone' barges, which are simply large elongated floating sacks, filled with oil or water. They are used on the upper Amazon for transporting oil and are returned, deflated (but not on donkeys), in much the same way as the skin boats of the Euphrates. They are also used to bring fresh water to hotels in the Greek islands for the baths of the tourists.

Blown-up structures probably deserve to be developed much further than they have been for technological uses. However, the great exploiters of this form of construction are plants and animals. Both plants and animals are in business as chemical factories and are, in consequence, full of complicated and messy fluids. Nothing could be more ‘natural* and economical, for instance, than to make a worm in the form of an elongated bag stuffed, so to speak, with the worm's squidgy insides.

Clearly, this works very well, and in fact it seems so natural and so economical that one wonders why animals ever bothered to acquire skeletons made from brittle, heavy bones. Would it not be much more convenient, for instance, if men were made like octopuses or squids or elephants* trunks? One view of the question, which was put to me by Professor Simkiss, is that animals never really meant to have skeletons at all; what may have happened was that the earliest bones were simply safe dumping-grounds for unwanted metal atoms in the body. Once animals had produced solid mineral lumps inside their bodies, then they might as well make use of them as attachments for muscles.

Wire wheels

It won't be a stylish marriage,

I can't afford a carriage,

But you'll look sweet upon the seat

Of a bicycle made for two!

Harry Dacre, Daisy Bell

In the traditional wooden carriage wheel the weight of the vehicle is taken in compression by each of the spokes in turn. A carriage is therefore rather like a centipede with a great many long legs which, taken together, are heavy and inefficient. This fact seems first to have dawned upon that remarkable and eccentric man, Sir George Cayley (1773-1857). Cayley was one of the earliest and most brilliant of the aircraft pioneers and he was interested in making better and lighter landing wheels for his aircraft. As early as 180 8 it occurred to him that a great deal of weight could be saved by designing wheels in which the spokes were in tension rather than in compression. This thinking led, eventually, to the development of the modern bicycle wheel, in which the wire spokes are in tension while the compressive forces are taken by the rim, which can be quite light and thin, since it is well stabilized against buckling.

In conjunction with the pneumatic tyre, the wire wheel made bicycling practicable for ordinary people – with considerable social consequences, from Daisy Bell onwards. The saving in weight is, however, mostly confined to large lightly loaded wheels, such as bicycle wheels. When the wheel becomes smaller and the loads larger there is generally not much advantage to be gained from using tension spokes. In modern sports cars pressed-steel wheels are very little heavier than wire wheels, which are usually not worth the bother and expense.

On choosing a better material – and what is a ‘better' material anyway?

Nature may be supposed to know her business when she chooses between the various possibilities in the way of biological tissues; but mere men, even very great men, seem to have the strangest ideas about materials. According to Homer, the bow of Apollo was made of silver* – a metal whose strain energy storage is negligible. In a rather later age we were told that the floors of Heaven were made of gold, or alternatively of glass: both very unsuitable substances. Poets are always quite hopeless about materials; but most of the rest of us are not much better. In fact very few people ever think rationally about the subject at all.

Quirks of fashion and prestige seem to play a large part in the matter. Gold is not really a very good material for watches, nor is steel for office furniture. The Victorians insisted on making all sorts of improbable articles, such as umbrella stands, out of cast iron, and there is the story of the African chief who had his palace made out of the same substance.

Although the choice of materials is sometimes irrational and eccentric, more often it is highly traditional and conservative. Of course there is sound reason behind a good deal of traditional materials selection, but it is so mixed up with unreason that it is difficult to separate the two. Artists from Lewis Carroll to Dali have discovered that it is possible to impart a considerable psychological shock merely by implying that some familiar object might be made from an apparently unsuitable material, such as rubber or bread and butter. Engineers are very susceptible to these effects; they would be a good deal shocked nowadays at the idea of a large wooden ship. Our ancestors were much more shocked at the idea of an iron one.

The acceptability of various materials changes with time in curious and interesting ways. Thatch is a case in poiftt. Thatch was once the cheapest and least regarded of roofing materials, but in the poorer country districts it often had to suffice even for the roofs of churches. During the eighteenth century, when these parishes became richer, subscriptions were raised to replace the thatch by slates or tiles. Sometimes the money was inadequate to do the whole job, and in these cases the thatch had perforce to be left on those areas of the church roof which were not likely to be seen by passers-by; only the side which faced the main road was tiled. Nowadays the balance of prestige is reversed, and in the Home Counties thatched roofs are the pride and joy of the wealthier of the business fraternity.

Materials, fuel and energy

The twentieth century may be known to posterity as the ‘age of steel and concrete'. It may also be known as the ‘age of ugliness', and perhaps by other unpleasant names as well, such as the ‘age of waste'. It is not only engineers who are obsessed by steel and concrete (and quite indifferent to appearances); politicians and the man in the street seem to have caught the same infection. The disease seems to have originated two hundred years ago with the Industrial Revolution and cheap coal – which led to cheap iron -which led to iron steam engines fitted to turn that coal into cheap mechanical energy: and so on round and round in ever more energy-intensive circles. Thus coal and oil store a great deal of energy packed into a small volume. Engines process a great deal of this energy very quickly and within a small space. They then deliver the energy as electricity or mechanical work in concentrated forms. On this concentration of energy our whole contemporary technology rests. The materials of this technology, steel, aluminium and concrete, themselves require a great deal of energy to manufacture them; how much energy is indicated in Table 6. Because they need so much energy to make them these materials can only be employed with profit within an energy-intensive economy. We are not only investing money capital in a technical device; we are also investing energy capital, and in both cases it is necessary to secure a fair return on the investment.

TABLE 6

Approximate energies required to produce various materials

Material n = energy to manufacture Joules × 109 per ton Oil equivalent tons

Steel (mild) 60 1·5

Titanium 800 20

Aluminium 250 6

Glass 24 0·6

Brick 6 0·15

Concrete 4·0 0·1

Carbon-fibre composite 4,000 100

Wood (spruce) 1·0 0·025

Polyethylene 45 1·1

Note. All these values are very rough and no doubt controversial; but I think that they are in the right region. The value given for carbon-fibre composites is admittedly a guess; but it is a guess founded upon many years of experience in developing similar fibres.

In spite of the high cost and increasing scarcity of energy the trend in the energy-intensive direction is increasing rather than diminishing. Advanced engines, such as gas turbines, process more and more energy, more and more hectically, within less and less space. Advanced devices require advanced materials, and the newer materials, such as high-temperature alloys and carbon-fibre plastics, consume more and more energy in their manufacture.

Most probably this kind of thing cannot go on for very much longer, for the whole system is entirely dependent upon cheap and concentrated sources of energy, such as oil. Living Nature may be regarded as an enormous system for extracting energy, not from concentrated but from diffuse sources, and then using that energy with the uttermost economy. Many attempts are on foot at present to collect energy for technology from diffuse sources, such as the sun, the wind or the sea. Many of these are likely to fail because the energy investment which will be needed, using conventional collecting structures built of steel or concrete, cannot yield an economic return. A quite different approach to the whole concept of ‘efficiency' will be needed. Nature seems to look at these problems in terms of her ‘metabolic investment', and we may have to do something of the same kind.

It is not only that metals and concrete require a great deal of energy, per ton, to manufacture (Table 6), but also that, for the diffuse or lightly loaded structures which are usually needed for systems of low energy intensity, the actual weight of devices made from steel and concrete is likely to be very many times higher than it would be if we used more sensible and more civilized materials.

As we shall shortly see, timber can be one of the most ‘efficient' of all materials in a strictly structural sense. For large dimensions and light loads, a wooden structure is many times lighter than one made from steel or concrete. One of the difficulties with timber, in the past, has always been that trees take a long time to grow and wood is slow and expensive to season.

Probably the most important development in materials during the last few years has been that made by the plant geneticists who have been breeding fast-growing varieties of commercial timbers. Thus varieties of Pinus radiata (Weymouth pine) are now being planted which, in favourable conditions, will increase in diameter by up to 12 centimetres per year and may be fit for felling, as mature timber, in six years. So there is a good prospect of timber becoming a crop which can be grown on a short time-cycle. Nearly all the energy which is needed to make it grow is provided, free, by the sun. Presumably, when one has finished with a timber structure, it could be burnt to yield up most of the energy which it has collected while it was growing. This is, of course, in no way true of steel or concrete.

Again, timber used to need lengthy and expensive seasoning in heated kilns, which used up a good deal of energy. As a result of recent research it is now possible to season sizeable soft-wood scantlings in twenty-four hours, at a very low cost. These are very important developments in relation to structures and to the world energy situation, and it behoves us to take account of them.

Some algebraical analysis of the structural efficiencies in various roles arid in terms of weight, of different materials, is given in Appendix 4. The design of a number of high-technology structures, such as aircraft, is largely controlled by the criterion E/ρ: that is to say, by the ‘specific Young's modulus' which governs the weight-cost of the overall deflections. It happens that, for the majority of traditional structural materials, molybdenum, steel, titanium, aluminium, magnesium and wood, the value of E/ρ is sensibly constant. It is for this reason that, over the last fifteen or twenty years, governments have spent such large sums of money in developing new materials based on exotic fibres such as boron, carbon and silicon carbide.

Fibres of this sort may or may not be effective in aerospace; but what seems to be certain is that not only are they expensive but they also need large amounts of energy to make them. For this reason their future use is likely to be rather limited, arjd, in my own view, they are not likely to become the ‘people's materials' of the foreseeable future.

The requirement for a strict and expensive control of overall deflections is likely to be a very limited one; however, as we have seen, the weight-cost – and often the money cost – of carrying compressive loads is frequently very high. The weight-cost of carrying a compressive load in a column is governed, not by E/ρ, but by . The weight-cost of a panel is controlled by (Appendix 4). These requirements are summarized in Table 7. It will be seen that there is a large premium on low density; thus steel comes out rather badly, even compared with bricks and concrete. Furthermore, for many light-weight applications – such as airships or artificial limbs – wood is even better than carbon-fibre materials, besides being much cheaper.

In Table 8 these virtues are expressed in terms of energy-cost.

Here the advantage of the traditional materials – wood, brick and concrete – is overwhelming. This table makes one wonder whether the pursuit of materials based on exotic fibres is really justified. What really pays off for most of the common purposes of life is not carbon fibres, but holes. Nature tumbled to this a long time ago when she invented wood; and so did the Romans when they started to build churches from empty wine bottles. Holes are enormously cheaper, both in money and in energy, than any conceivable form of high-stiffness material. It would probably be better to spend more time and money on developing cellular or porous materials and less on boron or carbon fibres.

* Because the cross-section of a tension bar is proportional to the load, whereas the volume of the end fittings increases as the power of 3/2 of the load.

* Thinking algebraically, we can put the problem of carrying a load, P, over a length, JL, in n parallel tension bars in the form:

where Z = total weight of all the tension members, per unit length

P = total load carried

s = safe working stress

k = a coefficient connected with the cunning of the designer

W = work of fracture of the material

n = number of tension members employed

p = density of material.

The proof of this is to be found in Cox's The Design of Structures of Least Weight. I have modified Cox's formula slightly.
