Oliver Wendell Holmes, The One-Hoss Shay

The entire physical world is most properly regarded as a great energy system: an enormous market-place in which one form of energy is for ever being traded for another form according to set rules and values. That which is energetically advantageous is that which will sooner or later happen. In one sense a structure is a device which exists in order to delay some event which is energetically favoured. It is energetically advantageous, for instance, for a weight to fall to the ground, for strain energy to be released -and so on. Sooner or later the weight will fall to the ground and the strain energy will be released; but it is the business of a structure to delay such events for a season, for a lifetime or for thousands of years. All structures will be broken or destroyed in the end -just as all people will die in the end. It is the purpose of medicine and engineering to postpone these occurrences for a decent interval.

The question is: what is to be regarded as a ‘decent interval'? Every structure must be built so as to be ‘safe' for what may reasonably be considered an appropriate working life. For a rocket case this might be a few minutes, for a car or an aircraft, ten or twenty years, for a cathedral perhaps a thousand years. Oliver Wendell Holmes's ‘one-hoss shay' was constructed to last for a hundred years – neither more nor less – and it disintegrated, exactly as planned, on 1 November 1855, just as tjhe parson had reached ‘fifthly' in the composition of his sermon. But, of course, this was nonsense. Again, the egregious but heroic Mr Honey in Nevil Shute's No Highway predicts the failure of the tail of the Reindeer airliner from ‘metal fatigue' after exactly 1,440 flying hours – plus or minus a day or so. This again was nonsense, as Nevil Shiite must have known, being an experienced aircraft designer.

It is impossible, in practice, to plan for a ‘safe' life of exactly so many hours or years. We can only consider the problem in statistical terms and in the light of accumulated data and experience. We then build in whatever margin of safety seems reasonable. All the time Ave are working on a basis of probabilities and estimates. If we make the structure too weak we may save weight and money, but then the chance of the thing breaking too soon will become unacceptably high. Contrariwise, if we make a structure so strong that, in human terms, it is likely to last ‘for ever' – which is what the public would like – then it will probably be too heavy and expensive. As we shall see, there are many cases where more danger is incurred by extra weight than is avoided by the corresponding increase of strength. Because we are necessarily working on a statistical basis, when we design a practical structure for a realistic life we have to accept that there is always some finite risk, however small, of premature failure.

As Sir Alfred Pugsley points out in his book The Safety of Structures,* it is just at this rather interesting stage that we may have to abandon a strictly logical approach to the problem. As Pugsley says, the human emotions are quite exceptionally sensitive to the fear of structural failure, and the layman clings with great tenacity to the idea that any structure or device with which he is personally associated should be ‘unbreakable'. This crops up in all sorts of connections; sometimes it does no harm, sometimes the effect is counter-productive. During the last war aircraft designers had the choice, to some extent, of trading off structural safety against other qualities in the aircraft. Now the losses of bomber aircraft by enemy action were very high, something like one out of twenty in each sortie.† Against this, the losses from structural failures were very few, much less than one aircraft in ten thousand. The structure of an aeroplane 	accounts for practically a third of its total weight, and it would have been rational to have slimmed the structural parts of the bombers in return for other advantages.

If this had been done there would have been some small increase in the structural accident rate, but the weight that would have been saved could have been invested in more defensive guns or in thicker protective armour. In that case there would no doubt have been a significant reduction in the net, or overall, casualty rate. But the airmen would not hear of anything of the kind. They preferred the big risk of being shot down by the enemy to the smaller risk of the aircraft breaking up in the air for structural reasons.

Pugsley suggests that the feeling that it is in some way outrageous for a structure to break may be inherited from our arboreal ancestors, who were frightened, above all things, that the trees in which they lived might break beneath them – when down would come baby and cradle and all. And besides, the ancestors and their babies would fall into the mouths of their enemies on the ground, such as sabre-toothed tigers or whatnot. Whether this is the real reason or no, engineers have to take these sort of feelings into account, even though the extra weight incurred may involve dangers of its own.

The accuracy of strength calculations

It is implicit in any rational approach to questions of strength and safety that the engineer should be able to predict, with sufficient accuracy, the strength of a proposed structure when it is new -even if he is in doubt about how long it may be expected to last. While this may be roughly the case for simple structures such as ropes and chains and straightforward beams and columns, as we saw in Chapter 4, it is just not true at all for the more elaborate and critical artefacts, things like aircraft and ships.

Since there is available a great body of accumulated experience with various kinds of structures, since there also exists a vast and highly mathematical literature on the subject, and since academic elasticians, in their pride, deliver endless lectures about the theory of structures, that statement might be regarded as sticking one's neck out. However, it is true.

Consider, for instance, the statistics for the strength of aircraft. Since the saving of weight is important and since the consequences of failure are very horrible, a great deal of care and thought is naturally given to the structural design of aeroplanes, and every detail is meticulously checked. The drawings and calculations are made by highly skilled designers and stressmen and draughtsmen, using the most scientific methods. When these people have done their sums the strength calculations are checked, quite independently, by an entirely different set of experts. Thus the strength predictions which are finally arrived at are about as accurate and painstaking as is humanly possible. Finally, and to make quite certain, an actual full-scale airframe is tested to destruction.

It is not possible to give really up-to-date results because so few different types of aeroplane have been ordered in recent years that the figures are not statistically significant. However, when aircraft were simpler and cheaper, a comparatively large number of designs reached at least the prototype stage. Between 1935 and 1955 something in the region of a hundred different kinds of aeroplane were built and tested to destruction in this country. Thus the results for this period form a fairly reliable guide with some sort of statistical basis.

Naturally, the actual figures of the required strengths for these different aircraft varied a great deal, according to the size and type of aeroplane. However, each design team could be said to be aiming at that strength which is known in the jargon of the aircraft trade as ‘120 per cent fully factored load'.* If structural design were anything like an exact profession one would expect the various test results, when plotted on a curve or ‘histogram', to cluster pretty closely around the value for 120 per cent fully factored load, give or take a very little. In other words the results should produce a narrow ‘normal' or bell-shaped distribution curve, much like Figure 1.

As is fairly well known, nothing of the sort happened. When the results are plotted the histogram looks more like Figure 2. The experimental strengths tend to be randomly distributed between about 50 per cent and 150 per cent of the required or fully factored load. That is to say, even the most eminent designers cannot be relied upon to predict the strength of an aeroplane within a range of three to one. Some of these aircraft were less than half as strong as they should have been; others were much too strong and therefore considerably heavier than they needed to be.

Figure 1. Expected statistical distribution of experimental aircraft strengths (schematic diagram).

Figure 2. Actual distribution of strengths of airframes broken in test-frame, 193S-5S (very approximate schematic diagram).

When it comes to ships, there are really no data on which one can base this sort of judgement – for the reason that ships are almost never tested to destruction under laboratory conditions. It is therefore impossible to tell how good or bad naval architects are at their job – at least as far as strength predictions are concerned. However, as we said in Chapter 5, the number of structural accidents to ships is considerable, and it seems very possible that the number of accidents per ton-mile is increasing at the present time.

With regard to bridges, the problem of strength calculation is in some respects easier than with ships and aircraft, since the loading conditions are less varied. Nevertheless, the number of failures in modem bridges is quite significant.

Designing by experiment

Now, in building of chaises, I tell you what,

There is always somewhere a weakest spot -

In hub, tire, felloe, or spring or thill,

In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,

In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace – lurking still,

Find it somewhere you must and will.

Oliver Wendell Holmes, The One-Hoss Shay

The fallibility of the theoretical design process is, of course, the reason for the insistence on the experimental strength testing of all aircraft. However, the benefits of an experimental approach extend still further. We have assumed that it ought to be the designer's aim for a structure to fail, the first time it is tested, exactly at the required load. But even the most scientifically designed structure is very unlikely to be of consistent strength throughout all its parts – like the legendary shay, where and so on for many components and many lines of verse.

...the wheels were Just as strong as the thills,

And the floor was just as strong as the sills,

And the panels were just as strong as the floor -

On the test-frame the structure breaks at the weakest place; all the rest of the structure is therefore of greater strength. If an air-frame fails initially at just the required 120 per cent it follows that much the greater part of the structure is too strong for its purpose, and this extra strength is completely wasted. But we have no means of knowing where and how to lighten the structure. Repeated tests on large structures are expensive and time-consuming, but, where time and money allow, it is better to arrange, if possible, for the initial failure to occur at a load comfortably below the official 120 per cent. The weak place thus indicated can then be strengthened and the whole structure retested – and so on.

The war-time Mosquito bomber, which was one of the most successful aircraft in history, failed initially at 88 per cent of the factored load – in the rear wing-spar. The aeroplane was then progressively strengthened up to a figure of 118 per cent. It was owing, partly, to the exceptionally light and strong airframe that the performance of this aircraft was outstanding.

This is, roughly speaking, the Darwinian method, which Nature seems to rely on to develop her own structures – though she seems to be in less of a hurry and less mindful of the value of life than are most civilized human engineers. It is also, to a notable extent, the method employed by the makers of cars and other cheap, mass-produced goods. These people tend to make their products deliberately too weak for their purpose and to rely upon customers' complaints to detect the significant faults.

Thus a great deal of the strength-predicting element of design boils down to a sort of game in which we try to spot the weakest link in a load-bearing system. The more complicated the structure, the more difficult and unreliable this becomes. Fortunately, the design of a great many structures, from furniture and buildings to aeroplanes, is rescued from becoming a completely ridiculous process by the fact that the stiffness requirements may be more exacting than the strength requirements. Thus, if the structure is made stiff enough for its purpose, it may then very well be sufficiently strong. Since the deflections in a structure depend upon its general character rather than upon the existence of a ‘weakest link', stiffness predictions are much easier to make, and more reliable, than strength predictions. This is what we really mean when we talk about designing a thing ‘by eye'.

How long will it last?

This also said Phocylides:

A tiny rock-built citadel

Is finer far, if ordered well,

Than all your frantic Ninevehs.

Phocylides (translated by Sir Maurice Bowra)

In discussing the strength and stability of the masonry cathedrals Professor Jacques Heyman has laid down the principle that ‘If a structure will stand for five minutes, it will stand for five hundred years.' For masonry structures built upon rock this is, broadly speaking, true. However, many cathedrals and other buildings have been founded upon soft ground. If this soft soil creeps (Chapter 7) – which happens quite often – curious things will happen, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Such movements take time and can often be predicted, but they are very expensive to put right, and a certain number of buildings, both ancient and modern, fall down or have to be demolished for this reason.

In most types of structure, rot and rust are very active agents of decay. It is partly the fear of rot which has turned engineers and architects in Britain against timber. However, the poor benighted foreigners in America and Canada and Scandinavia and Switzerland, who build between them about 1,500,000 wooden houses each year, do not seem to be troubled with rot to the same extent, and it might be a good idea to see how they manage these things. The use of wood is greatly on the increase in these countries.

Timbers vary a great deal in their natural resistance to decay, and Lloyd's Register allocates a fixed number of years of life to each of the different timbers which are used in shipbuilding. However, with modern knowledge and methods of treatment, it should be possible to get a practically indefinite life from almost any kind of wood.

Most metals corrode in service. Modern mild steel rusts very much worse than Victorian wrought iron or cast iron, and so rust is, to some extent, a modern problem. Because the cost of labour is high, the cost of the painting and maintenance of steelwork is high. This is one good reason for using reinforced concrete, since steel embedded in concrete does not rust. In fact large modern ships, such as tankers, are constructed for a life of about fifteen years; on the whole it is cheaper to scrap than to paint. The life of cars is even shorter, usually for the same reason. It is true that for some structures one could use stainless steel but it is by no means always proof against corrosion, and stainless steels are expensive and awkward to fabricate. Besides this, the ‘ fatigue properties' of stainless steels are usually bad.

These are some of the reasons for choosing aluminium alloys; but, apart from the extra cost, there are a number of cases where the stiffness of aluminium has proved inadequate. The difficulty of welding aluminium is also a handicap. Some Communist countries see a great future for aluminium and have invested largely in aluminium plants. The London stock-markets were considerably shaken by the Tube Investments-British Aluminium take-over bid in 1961. However, the market for aluminium has not expanded to anything like the extent which was anticipated by the businessmen concerned in this transaction. In any case it requires more energy to make aluminium than to make steel.

Even if the material of a structure does not deteriorate, its life may be subject to statistical effects which are sometimes calculable – and sometimes not. Many structures are likely to be broken only in rather exceptional circumstances, and it may be a long time before these circumstances arise. Freakishly high waves, in the case of a ship, and exceptionally severe upward gusts with aircraft are cases in point. Some structures are likely to be broken only by unusual combinations of events. For a bridge this might be the coincidence of very high winds with exceptional traffic loads. Although such eventualities ought to be provided for, it may be many years before they actually happen. So an essentially unsafe structure may stand for a long time, simply because it has never been fully tried.

Responsible engineers do, of course, try to predict things of this sort and to make structural provision for them, but in many cases such peak loads shade off into what the insurance companies call ‘acts of God'.* If a ship runs into a large bridge, destroying both the bridge and the ship, as happened recently in Tasmania, it is very difficult to see what either the naval architect or the bridge designer could have been expected to do about it from the structural point of view. The problem is one not for the structural engineer but for the local Pilotage Association. Again, aircraft cannot be designed to be flown into mountains. We do, to a certain extent, design cars to be driven into brick walls without killing the passengers, but then we do not expect the car to be of much use afterwards.

Metal fatigue, Mr Honey and all that

One of the most insidious causes of loss of strength in a structure is ‘fatigue': that is to say, the cumulative effect of fluctuating loads. The dramatic possibilities of fatigue in metals were first exploited in popular literature in 1895 in Kipling's account of what happened when the propellor of the Grotkau dropped off somewhere in the Bay of Biscay because of a fatigue crack in the tailshaft.† Kipling went out of fashion, but public interest in fatigue was revived in 1948 by Nevil Shute's No Highway. The success of this story, both as a book and as a film, was no doubt partly due to the character of Mr Honey, the archetypal boffin, but perhaps still more to the three Comet disasters, which occurred not very long afterwards. As Whistler remarked some time ago, Nature keeps creeping up on Art. The circumstances of the Comet accidents were not very different from those imagined in No Highway, except that many more lives were lost and a great deal of damage was done to the British aircraft industry.

As a matter of fact, engineers* knowledge of fatigue effects in metals goes back rather over a hundred years. Indeed it was not long after the Industrial Revolution that it began to be noticed that the moving parts of machinery would sometimes break at loads and stresses which would have been perfectly safe in a stationary component. This was especially dangerous in railway trains, whose axles would sometimes break off suddenly and for no apparent reason after they had been in service for a time. The effect soon came to be known as ‘fatigue', and the classical researches on the subject were carried out during the middle years of the nineteenth century by a German railway official called Wöhler (1819-1914). From his photograph Herr Wöhler looks exactly what one would expect a German nineteenth-century railway official to look like; but he did a very useful job.

As we said in Chapter 5, even though there may be a high local stress at the tip of a notch or a crack, the crack will not extend – so long as it is shorter than the ‘critical Griffith length' – because making it spread requires work to be done against the ‘work of fracture' of the material. However, when the stress in the material is a fluctuating one, slow changes take place within the crystalline structure of the metal, and this is particularly likely to happen in the region of a stress concentration. These changes have the effect of reducing the work of fracture of the metal in such a manner that the crack is able to extend, very slowly, even though it may be much shorter than the ‘critical length'.

In this way a tiny unseen crack may start from any hole or notch or irregularity in a stressed metal and may spread across the material, which is not, as a whole, changed in any obvious way. Sooner or later, such a ‘fatigue crack' will reach the critical length for an ordinary common or garden crack. When this happens, the crack will immediately speed up and run right across the material, often with very serious consequences. It is usually quite easy to diagnose a fatigue crack after failure because of its characteristic striped or banded appearance. Before rupture, however, an incipient fatigue failure may be practically impossible to spot.

Naturally metallurgists and others do a great deal of experimental fatigue testing on their materials, and a great many different types of testing machine are now available for the purpose. It is common to consider the fatigue properties of a metal in terms of a reversed stress (±s) – that is to say, the sort of stress which would occur in a rotating cantilever, such as the axle of a vehicle. (There are ways of converting these results to other conditions of fluctuating stress.) This reversed stress (±s) is usually plotted on a graph against the logarithm of the number (n) of times the stress has to be applied to a specimen to cause failure. This is sometimes called an ‘s-n diagram'.

The s-n diagram for a typical steel would look like Figure 3. It will be seen that the ‘curve' is a dog-legged affair which flattens off after about a million reversals – which might be equivalent to about 3,000 miles of service for the axle of a car or train, or about ten hours of running for an ordinary car engine, which, of course, goes round much faster than the wheels. The existence of a definite ‘fatigue limit' of this nature for materials like iron and steel constitutes a great comfort to the engineer. If his engine or his vehicle will run for 106 or 107 revolutions – which may only take a few hours – then there is some hope of its being safe indefinitely. But fatigue is a danger which always needs to be considered.

Figure 3. Typical fatigue curve for iron or steel.

Aluminium alloys do not have a definite fatigue limit but tend to tail off, something after the fashion of Figure 4. This makes them more dangerous to use and accounts for some apparently old-fashioned prejudices in favour of steel for use in machinery and other structures.

The Comet accidents, which occurred in 1953 and 1954, naturally caused consternation and well-justified alarm. The investigation of these accidents by Sir Arnold Hall and a large team of experts was a classical feat, not only of engineering detection, but also of deep-sea salvage. The broken parts of one of the aircraft, which had fallen into the Mediterranean, had to be dredged up from a depth of over 300 feet or 50 fathoms. The salvage people managed to recover practically the whole of the aeroplane and the innumerable fragments covered the floor of a large hangar at Farnborough. As far as I remember, no piece was more than two or three feet across.

Figure 4. Non-ferrous alloys such as brass and aluminium frequently do not show any definite fatigue limit.

The Comet was one of the earliest airliners to have a pressurized fuselage. The main purpose of this was, of course, to spare the passengers from the discomfort and danger of the atmospheric pressure changes associated with change of altitude. In the old days, when flying over the Rocky Mountains, one used to have to eat one's lunch while wearing an oxygen mask: this now ranks as one of those lost skills. In a pressurized aircraft the fuselage becomes, in effect, a cylindrical pressure vessel, not unlike a very thin-walled boiler, which is pressurized and relaxed every time the aircraft climbs and descends.

The lethal mistake in the design of the Comet lay in not realizing sufficiently the danger of ‘fatigue' occurring at stress concentrations in the metal of the fuselage under these circumstances. The Comet was built from aluminium alloys, and most of de Havilland's previous experience had been gained with wooden aeroplanes, such as the triumphantly successful Mosquito. I am not suggesting for a moment that de Havilland's very able design staff did not know a lot about fatigue; but it is possible that the danger of fatigue in aluminium alloys may not have burnt itself sufficiently deeply into their collective consciousness. Wood is much less susceptible to this danger than metals – which is one of its great advantages.

In each of these accidents cracks,seem to have started from the same small hole in the fuselage and spread, slowly and undetected, until they reached the ‘critical Griffith length'. Whereupon the skin tore catastrophically and the fuselage exploded like a blown-up balloon. By repeatedly pressurizing a Comet fuselage in a large tank of water at Farnborough, Sir Arnold Hall was able to reproduce the effect so that it could be observed, as it were, in slow motion.

Part of the trouble about the Comet accidents was that the fatigue cracks which must have existed were never spotted by an inspector, perhaps because he was not expecting to find them, but more probably because they were too short to be seen easily. Nowadays aircraft fuselages are designed to contain with safety cracks up to about two feet long, and one would think that so long a crack could hardly fail to be seen in good time. There is, however, the story about the two cleaners at London Airport. These ladies finished sweeping out the cabins of an empty airliner late one night. They shut the door and went down the steps on to the tarmac.

‘You've forgotten to switch off the light in the toilet, Mary.'

‘ How do you know?'

‘Can't you see it shining through the crack in the fuselage?'

Accidents to wooden ships

Before the days of railways nearly all the heavy traffic went by water. Besides the deep sea trade and the Continental trade and the inland trade by river and canal, there was an even larger coastal trade. Many thousands of little wooden brigs and schooners, of the kind caricatured by W. W. Jacobs, transported anything and everything, not only into the coastwise creeks and harbours, but to almost every possible or impossible beach. A ship would be grounded on the beach at high water and, when the tide fell, would unload her coal or bricks or lime or household furniture into carts which were driven alongside. When the tide rose again, she would slip away to sea and then go and do it all over again somewhere else.

Naturally this was rather a risky business, but during the eighteenth century most of the smaller vessels could afford to lay up and refit during the worst of the winter – when the crews could see something of their families and of the local pubs. This slightly idyllic and not exceptionally dangerous state of affairs was upset by the more competitive conditions of the nineteenth century. Under commercial pressures vessels had to trade throughout the winter and could not afford, as a rule, to wait for weather. Indeed the regularity of some of these little sailing ships would put a lot of modern goods trains to shame.

But, of course, a price had to be paid. During the middle 1830s an average of 567 shipwrecks occurred round the coasts of this country each year; as a result, a yearly average of 894 lives were lost. Whether these figures are better or worse, per ton-mile of goods delivered, than modern lorries I do not know. At any rate the public conscience was disturbed at the time and Parliament appointed a Select Committee to investigate the ‘Causes of Shipwrecks'. After hearing a great deal of evidence, the committee reported that, apart from minor causes, shipwrecks in this country could principally be attributed to the following conditions in ships:

Defective construction.

Inadequacy of equipment.

Imperfect state of repair.

They pronounced' That the defective construction of ships appears to have been greatly encouraged by the system of classification [i.e. the rules governing construction and repair of insured ships] which, from the year 1798 up to 1834, was followed by Lloyds.'

The committee went on to add that the system by which the government measured ships for tonnage dues encouraged thoroughly unseaworthy shapes of hull. The bureaucratic mind does not seem to change very greatly through the centuries.

To be fair, the problem of framing regulations for the strength and safety of ships, or any other kind of structure, is an extraordinarily difficult one. No doubt a certain amount of progress has been made in the matter since the 1830s. At the same time, and in a different sense, a great deal of technical progress has been prevented – especially by the various building regulations. As Pugsley points out in The Safety of Structures, it is inherently impossible to make regulations about the strength of structures which are proof against both fools and knaves without preventing, or at best handicapping, development and innovation. Regulations for structural safety are presumably necessary, but some of them are not only stultifying; they can be the actual cause of accidents.

To return to wooden ships: not only the clippers but the little brigs and brigantines and topsail schooners and barges – which were so beautiful and so satisfying – have all gone, and the yards that used to build them are now turning out yachts. The structural problem of a wooden yacht is both more and also less severe than that of larger vessels. Yachts' hulls are not bumped on shingle beaches while carrying cargoes of stone or coal, but they have a more difficult problem with regard to local impacts which their thin skins are not well fitted to resist.

Now that long voyages in small yachts have become so fashionable this question of the impact strength of the hull has become important. Yachts voyaging in deep waters have repeatedly been attacked and sunk by killer whales. These animals weigh about six tons and swim at around thirty knots. They seem to have a special hatred for small yachts, which they ram and hole below the waterline. This has now happened so often that the possibility cannot any longer be classed as an ‘act of God' (Poseidon presumably) but is a serious hazard which must be guarded against.

It is probably impracticable to make the sides of a small yacht thick enough and strong enough to resist such an attack. The best thing to do would seem to be to provide some sort of inflatable floatation gear to keep the yacht afloat – and preferably sailable – after she has been holed. So far, those who have survived these attacks have done so by taking to the dinghy, which, naturally, gave most of them a very unpleasant time before they were picked up by a steamer after many days or weeks.

More about boilers and pressure vessels – and something with boiling oil in it

For a considerable number of years before the railway system was completed much of the passenger and express freight traffic was carried by steamship. During the first half of the nineteenth century, not only were there far more steamers running to more Continental ports than is the case today, but there were also very numerous services between towns in Great Britain. Considerably the cheapest – and often the quickest and most comfortable -route from London to such places as Newcastle, Edinburgh or Aberdeen was by steamboat.

Accidents were fewer in steamships than in sailing vessels only because there were many fewer steamships. Nevertheless, between 1817 and 1839, there were ninety-two major accidents to steamships in British waters. Of these, twenty-three were due to boiler explosions. This is nothing like as bad a record as that of the American river steamers a few years later; but it is quite bad enough.

Some of the early boilers were made from unsuitable materials, such as cast iron. At least one cast-iron boiler, that of the S.S. Norwich, duly burst and killed several people. Even when boilers were more or less properly constructed from wrought iron, they were very commonly neglected and allowed to rust through until they burst. This was the cause of the loss of the For farshire on the Fame Islands in 1838. Five people were rescued by Grace Darling's superb feat of seamanship.*

Again a Parliamentary Committee was appointed, which reported in 1839 and produced an extensive, thorough, factual and almost incredible document. During the boom years of the expansion of the steam engine, sober, let alone competent, responsible or intelligent engine-room staff were almost unobtainable, even at very high wages. These people treated their engines and boilers with a degree of ignorance and carelessness which almost passes belief. For instance:

A steamer, on her passage from Ireland to Scotland, was perceived by her commander during the night, and in a smooth sea, to be going with much greater than ordinary velocity through the water. The engineer was not at his post; the Captain inquired of the fireman how it was that the engines were going so fast: the man said ‘He could not tell, for he had very little steam and had been firing hard nevertheless'. The Captain began to look about him and, approaching the chimney where the exposed safety valves were fixed, he perceived a passenger fast asleep with the greater part of the weight of his body resting on the flat, cheese shaped, weights of the safety valve. This man had contrived, with some luggage, to make his bed there for warmth. On arousing and turning him off, the valve rose, the steam escaped with a roar which denoted its having attained a very elevated pressure.

There was no mercurial gauge to indicate the pressure of the steam to the fireman who was accustomed to keep it as near as he could to the blowing-off point: and not having heard it escape, he ‘fired-up* believing his steam to be low; and he was too ignorant to ascertain the fact, though the increased speed of the engines should have informed him that something unusual had occurred.

It is mentioned by several of our correspondents that engine men, firemen and even masters have frequently been caught sitting, or even standing, on the safety valves, or hanging weights and resting their bodies on the levers in order to raise the pressure of the steam at the moment of starting.

The report goes on to say that it was also the practice to stow surplus bunker coal on top of the safety valve. The steamship Hercules blew up from this cause. Altogether, it is rather remarkable that only seventy-seven lives were lost from boiler explosions in British steamers during the period under review.

The record of the railways was about as bad as that of the steamships and for much the same causes. There was a succession of very serious accidents extending over a period of seventy or eighty years. About the last of these occurred in 1909. A locomotive boiler blew up although the pressure gauge appeared to be showing zero pressure. It turned out that a workman had assembled the safety valve the wrong way round, so that it was incapable of blowing off at all. The gauge appeared to show no pressure for the simple reason that the needle had gone right round its full travel and was pressing against the wrong side of the stop pin. Three people were killed and three more badly injured.

In these latter days the number of boiler explosions has greatly diminished. This is partly because the manufacture and maintenance of steam boilers is now closely controlled by law and by the insurance companies, but perhaps more because the number of steam engines in service is now quite small and those that do exist are nearly all large plants, such as power stations, which are presumably run by competent people.

But – when is a boiler not a boiler? This is quite an interesting legal question. There exist in industry a large number of pressure vessels of one kind or another which are used in various manufacturing processes. Many of these vessels are of more complicated and less conventional design than traditional boilers and they may be less obviously dangerous. In general the control over their manufacture and use is less strict than for ordinary boilers. However, many of these vessels are heated by process steam or by hot oil under pressure, so that the consequences of fracture may be nearly as bad. It is well to bear in mind that the fatigue limit for the weld metal in mild steel structures exposed to wet steam may be as low as ±2,000 p.s.L

In one instance in which I was concerned, two large rotating drums, used for making plastic-coated paper, had been converted from low-pressure oil heating to steam heating – using process steam at a higher pressure. To make certain, the insurance company's inspector had insisted that the drums be ‘strengthened' internally by connecting the flat end-plates to the cylindrical surface by means of a number of large triangular gussets, or brackets, cut from mild steel plate and welded in place.

Both drums burst in service after being used for a short time with steam heating. From the drawings I calculated that, in the two drums, there were forty-eight individual places at which failure should have taken place. In fact this was a pessimistic estimate; failure actually occurred at only forty-seven places. By the grace of God, nobody was killed or seriously injured: but it was naughty of the insurance company's inspector, who, I expect, was a diligent and well-meaning little man.

Another case was more tragic. A firm of chemical engineering contractors had bought in from elsewhere a mixing vessel which they installed as part of a plant they were constructing for a customer. Since this mixing vessel was intended to be heated by oil under pressure, the pressurized heating jacket had been subjected to a ‘proof test' with cold water. It had withstood a pressure of 65 p.s.i. without obvious damage before it was installed. However, when the plant was commissioned and the jacket was filled with very hot oil at only about 23 p.s.i., the jacket burst after a few hours of service, spraying a man with oil at 280° C, from the effects of which he died a few days afterwards.

According to the report of the official inspector, the accident could only have happened as a consequence of gross mismanagement by my clients, the firm of chemical engineers. As a result these people had become involved in very elaborate and expensive litigation in the High Court.

In fact the official report of the accident was based on faulty observation of the broken remains and was quite misleading. The vessel had burst, not because it was mishandled by my clients, but because it was of incompetent design and manufacture. Although the technical cause of the accident was, in reality, of a slightly subtle nature, both my clients and also the people who actually made the vessel had assumed the design of such a thing to be a trivial problem. In fact the vessel was never really ‘designed' at all in any sophisticated sense but was simply put together ‘ by eye' in a back-street welding shop.

What actually happened was that, during the ‘proof loading' the vital welds which held the pressurized heating jacket together were considerably distorted – although nobody noticed it at the time. In reality these welds were so near to failure that a few reversals of stress, resulting from a much lower pressure in the jacket, sufficed to cause a fatigue failure, with disastrous consequences. This possibility should have been spotted by a competent trained engineer. In law, and perhaps in equity, the major blame lay with the people who had made the vessel; but I cannot help thinking that the danger should have been foreseen by a competent firm of chemical engineers. When I went to see these people the managing director took me out to lunch. By way of making conversation I said' How many graduate engineers do you have in your organization, Mr—V

‘None, thank God!'

On cutting holes in things

Although it is generally rash to cut holes in an existing structure some people seem unable to resist the temptation to do so. A case in point occurred with the Master aircraft. This aeroplane was built as an advanced trainer for the R.A.F. just before the war. It had some of the performance, and many of the handling qualities, of the Hurricane and the Spitfire. In the emergency of 1940 some of the Masters were converted into operational fighters by installing six machine guns in the wings. The original trainer version of the machine had wire-operated control surfaces which, though they were perfectly satisfactory, gave a slightly ‘softer' response than those of a real fighter. Somebody therefore decided to change over from wire to rod control linkages in the fighter version of the Master. To make room for the rods which operated the rudder and elevator, suitable slots were cut in the rear bulkhead of the fuselage.

Before long we were faced with a series of three fatal accidents. In each case the tail had come off in flight. When we got the fuselage on the test-frame we found that its strength had been reduced to only 45 per cent of the fully factored load. The moral is, I suppose, to leave well alone.

A much better-known accident of this type, in which a great many lives were lost, occurred with the troopship Birkenhead. This iron steamship had started life as a warship in 1846 with adequate strength and well supplied with continuous water-tight bulkheads. When she was converted into a troopship, however, the War Office insisted that very large openings should be cut in the transverse water-tight bulkheads* so as to give more light and air and more apparent space for the troops.

In 1852 the Birkenhead was dispatched to India, by way of the Cape, with 648 persons on board, including twenty women and children. By an error of pilotage, the ship struck an isolated rock about four miles off the South African coast. The vessel was badly holed forward, and, since the bulkheads had been cut away, all the troop-decks in the forward part of the ship were flooded so quickly that many of the troops were drowned as they lay in their hammocks (the time being 2 a.m.).

Under the weight of the incoming water the flooded fore-part of the ship broke off and sank almost immediately, leaving the survivors crowded into the after-part, which sank more slowly. It was dark, the sea was full of sharks and the life-boats were inadequate. The troops behaved with great courage and discipline, smartly fallen-in on the after-deck, while the women and children were sent ashore in such boats as there were. All of the women and children were saved but only 173 men survived: the rest were drowned or eaten by sharks.

The most obvious effect of cutting holes in the bulkheads was, of course, that the various compartments in the ship flooded very rapidly, and this was undoubtedly the prime cause of the ship's loss. Fewer lives might have been lost, however, if the ship had not broken in two, and this must be attributed, at least in part, to the weakening of the hull as a whole by cutting away the bulkheads on which its strength depended.

The loss of the Birkenhead immediately became famous as an example of discipline and heroism – and deservedly so. When the news reached Berlin, the King of Prussia ordered the story to be read aloud to all the units of his army, specially paraded for the purpose. But perhaps it would have been better still if he had instructed his War Office not to interfere with the structure of ships, a matter which soldiers do not always understand.

According to Mr K. C. Barnaby, a distinguished naval architect, the idea that open space was more important than safety in troopships lasted for many years. He says that, as late as 1882, shipowners were complaining that, when they fitted additional bulkheads as urged by the Admiralty, the trooping authorities would not accept the ships on the ground that the spaces between the bulkheads were too small.*

On being overweight

Almost every structure has a tendency to turn out heavier than its designer intended. This is partly due to over-optimistic estimating in the weights office, but it is also due to a tendency on the part of almost everybody to ‘play safe' by making each part just that much thicker and heavier than is really necessary. In many people's eyes this is a sort of virtue – a sign of honesty and integrity – and we talk of things being ‘heavily built' as a term of praise, while ‘lightly built' is almost synonymous with ‘flimsy' or'shoddy'.

Sometimes this does not matter, but there are cases where it matters very much indeed. With aircraft the weight is tending to increase all the time, from the drawing-board onwards. Extra weight naturally restricts the fuel capacity or the payload of the aeroplane, but, besides this increase in gross weight, the centre of gravity of an aeroplane somehow always manages to work its way too far aft. In other words the weight of the tail tends to increase out of proportion to that of the rest of the machine. This can be a serjous matter. If the C.G. gets too far aft, the aircraft will acquire dangerous flying characteristics. It may have a tendency to go into a spin from which it is unable to recover. For this reason a surprising number of aircraft – including some very famous ones – have gone around all their lives carrying massive lead weights permanently bolted into their noses; this is necessary in order to keep the C.G. in a tolerably safe position. It need hardly be said that this is a bad thing.

The effects of overweight are just as bad, perhaps worse, with ships. Not only do all ship hulls tend to be overweight absolutely, but the C.G. tends, in this case, to creep, not backwards but upwards – ineluctably upwards. Now the stability of a ship, that is, her tendency to float right-side up, instead of upside-down or on her side, depends upon something called her ‘metacentric height'. This is the vertical distance between a mystic but important point called the ‘metacentre' and her centre of gravity. For excellent reasons the metacentric height of even a large ship is likely to be quite a small distance – in fact in the region of one or two feet, perhaps less. Thus the position of the C.G. has only to rise by a matter of a few inches to reduce the metacentric height by a very significant fraction which may well imperil the safety of the ship. Various ships have capsized on launching for this reason, and no doubt the yard foremen, or whoever were responsible for the extra top-weight, considered that they were in no way to blame.

We mentioned the loss of H.M.S. Captain in Chapter 11. The whole story of the Captain was intensely political and controversial at the time; I suppose few accidents can have had such far-reaching historical consequences. The Captain represented one turning point in the evolution of the steam battleship and perhaps in the modern concept of world power. The Admiralty have often been criticized by historians who know very little about ships for their slowness in changing from sail to steam. These are sometimes just the historians who are most critical of ‘imperialist expansion' and so forth.

It has to be borne in mind that, until comparatively recently, the unreliable engines, the high coal consumption and the short range of steam warships made them dependent upon bases and coaling stations and ‘colonies' as soon as they ventured beyond home waters. The exercise of world power by steam navies is a very different sort of thing from the strategy and logistics of eighteenth-century sailing fleets. It was basically for such reasons that the British Admiralty insisted upon the retention of full sail power, in addition to engines, in most of their battleships almost to within living memory.

The technical difficulty of combining sail with steam propulsion lay less in the nature of engines and sails than in the developments which took place during the nineteenth century in guns and armour. Turret guns require a wide angle of fire, besides being very heavy. The necessary protective armour was even heavier. To combine the required fields of fire, and also adequate stability, with full sail propulsion constituted a very difficult problem in naval architecture. In the 1860s the Admiralty were understandably inclined to proceed cautiously. If they had been allowed to continue to do so, all might have been well and history might have been considerably different.

This applecart was upset by a certain Captain Cowper Coles. Coles was one of those clever men with an exceptional talent for controversy and publicity. Having invented a new sort of gun-turret, he set himself to persuade the Admiralty to build a battleship around it with full sailing rig and therefore unlimited range. Coles managed to involve, not only the Admiralty, but also both Houses of Parliament, the Royal Family, the Editor of The Times and practically the whole of the Establishment in what became one of the greatest publicity exercises of its kind.

Tiring eventually of being called ‘reactionary' by half the newspapers and more than half the politicians in the country, the Admiralty gave way. They did what they had never done before, and will certainly never do again; they allowed a serving naval officer with no qualifications in naval architecture to design his own private battleship and have her built at the public expense.

The ship was built by Lairds at Birkenhead as Coles's responsibility and with none of the usual checks on design. She was, moreover, built in a blaze of vituperation and controversy. For much of the time Coles himself was ill and unable to leave his home in the Isle of Wight to attend the yard. As a result of all this muddling, the ship ended up about 15 per cent overweight. If this had not been the case it is at least possible that the ship would have been a success and comparatively safe.

As it was, the Captain was much too deep in the water and her C.G. was much too high up. Subsequent calculations showed that the ship would capsize if allowed to heel beyond an angle of 21°. However, the ship was commissioned in 1869 with much publicity. She made two deep-water cruises to the great satisfaction of The Times and of the First Lord of the Admiralty, who had his own midshipman son transferred into her. It looked as if the problems of world power, without the encumbrance and potential embarrassment of world bases, were going to continue to be soluble.

On her third voyage, returning from Gibraltar in 1870 in company with the rest of the Channel Fleet, H.M.S. Captain suddenly capsized in a rather moderate squall in the Bay of Biscay. 472 lives were lost – more than the total British dead at Trafalgar. Both Cowper Coles himself and the First Lord's son were drowned. Only seventeen men and one officer were saved.

Though not, of course, the sole factor, the loss of the Captain had a powerful effect in accelerating the change from sail to steam, or rather on the abolition of the full sailing rigs in big battleships. Whatever the technical consequences, the political ones were extensive. It will be remembered that the Suez Canal, which was opened just before the Captain was launched, originally belonged effectively to France. Disraeli bought the Suez Canal shares for the British government in 1874, and the acquisition of a worldwide chain of coaling stations became a political necessity. The whole story of the Captain disaster is complicated, but the immediate technical cause was undoubtedly the determination to ensure that the masts and hull of the ship should have really adequate strength – regardless of weight. It was one of many structural accidents in which nothing actually broke, but the causes were just as' structural' as if they had.

Aeroelasticity -or a reed shaken by the wind

When a fluid, such as air or water, flows past an obstruction, which might be a tree or a rope, eddies of fluid are formed behind it. Quite often, if you observe a reed or a bulrush growing in a fairly slow-moving river, you will see that the eddies in the sliding water are formed first on one side, then on the other, alternately. The result is a rhythmic variation of fluid pressure, from one flank of the obstruction to the other. Such a succession or ‘street' of eddies is called a ‘Karman strasse', after the aerodynamicist von Karman, who first described it. It is often quite easy to see eddies on the surface of smooth water though eddies in air are invisible unless they are shown up by smoke or dead leaves or some similar indicator. In fact, however, just the same Karman strasse of eddies happens when air blows past a flag or a tree or a wire. The result of these alternate eddies, acting first on one side then the other, is that the flag flaps, the tree sways and the telegraph wires sing and hum in the wind. Thus a sail will flap as soon as the sheet is eased and may very well split itself or injure somebody. I remember seeing a man knocked out by a flogging sheet-block; there is a lot of energy involved. When a big ship is tacking in a breeze, the noise is as loud as gunfire and much more impressive.

If the frequency of the aerodynamic stimulus provided by the eddies happens to coincide with one of the natural periods of vibration of the obstruction, then the amplitude of the movement may increase until something breaks. It is this sort of thing, rather than steady wind pressure, which usually accounts for trees being blown down. In a somewhat more sophisticated way this is also what is rather too apt to happen with aeroplanes and suspension bridges. It can be prevented by making the structure adequately stiff, especially in torsion. As we have already remarked, it is the torsional stiffness requirements which generally govern the design, and the structure weight, of modern aircraft.

Although Telford's Menai suspension bridge was quite badly damaged by wind-induced oscillations not long after it was built, it took about a century for the reality of this danger to register properly with bridge designers. The classic catastrophe was that of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in America in 1940. This bridge, which had a span of 2,800 feet (840 metres), was built without adequate torsional stiffness. As a result it swayed in even a moderate breeze to such an extent that the locals immediately christened it ‘Galloping Gertie'. Quite soon after it was built it swayed and wriggled itself into a dramatic collapse in a wind of only 42 m.p.h. Fortunately somebody happened to be present with a film in their cine-camera. The camera worked and the price of the film must have turned out to be a good investment, since it has been shown repeatedly in practically every engineering school in the world ever since (Plate 20).

In consequence modern suspension bridges are built with adequate stiffness, especially torsional stiffness. As in aircraft, the stiffness requirements account for a good proportion of the weight of the bridge. In the case of the Severn road bridge (Plate 12), for instance, the decking is made from a very large steel tube of flattish six-sided section, built up from mild steel plates. During construction this tube was floated out in sections, which were hoisted into place and then welded into a continuous structure.

Engineering design as applied theology

In nearly all accidents we need to distinguish two different levels of causation. The first is the immediate technical or mechanical reason for the accident; the second is the underlying human reason. It is quite true that design is not a very precise business, that unexpected things happen, that genuine mistakes are made and so forth; but much more often the ‘real' reason for an accident is preventable human error.

It is rather fashionable at present to assume that error is one of those tilings for which it is not really fair to blame people, who, after all were ‘doing their best' or are the victims of their upbringing and environment, or the social system – and so on and so on. But error shades off into what it is now very unpopular to call ‘sin'. In the course of a long professional life spent, or misspent, in the study of the strength of materials and structures I have had cause to examine a lot of accidents, many of them fatal. I have been forced to the conclusion that very few accidents just ‘happen' in a morally neutral way. Nine out of ten accidents are caused, not by more or less abstruse technical effects, but by old-fashioned human sin – often verging on plain wickedness.

Of course I do not mean the more gilded and juicy sins like deliberate murder, large-scale fraud or Sex. It is squalid sins like carelessness, idleness, won't-learn-and-don't-need-to-ask, you-can't-tell-me-anything-about-my-job, pride, jealousy and greed that kill people. Though some engineering firms have splendid design teams, far too many firms in this country are technically incompetent – often to a criminal extent. Many of these people have risen from the shop floor, and, out of a mixture of pride and meanness, they intensely resent any suggestion that they should seek proper advice or employ qualified staff.

It is my experience that far more accidents occur every week than ever get into the papers; generally they are caused by lack of proper care and professional competence. I very much doubt if the remedy lies in the imposition of yet more regulations. It seems to me that what is wanted is the creation of more public awareness and a climate of opinion which regards such ‘mistakes' as morally culpable. The man who drilled a hole in the wrong place in the wing-spar of a wooden aeroplane, plugged the hole, and said nothing, was acquitted. Presumably the jury thought that the moral blame was negligible.

What is wanted is much more publicity; the difficulty lies in the law of libel. In most cases, if the real causes of an accident are made public, somebody's face will be very red, and it is likely that their business or professional reputation will suffer. Most practising engineers are acutely aware of this and have to keep quiet or risk heavy damages. In my opinion there should be some way round this, for it is in the public interest that accidents and blunders should be publicized.

Though the great majority of structural accidents are sordid back-street affairs which we hear very little about, there are, of course, a certain number of great dramatic accidents which, for a while, monopolize the headlines. Of such a kind were the Tay bridge collapse in 1879, the capsize of the Captain in 1870, and the R101 disaster in 1930. These are very often intensely human and intensely political affairs, caused basically by ambition and pride. The sinking of the Captain was of this nature: the two men who carried the heaviest moral responsibility paid heavily for their faults, the one with his own life, the other with that of his son. Unfortunately a great many other lives were lost too.

The wreck of the airship R101, which hit the ground and was burnt out at Beauvais in 1930, was basically similar. There is a splendid account of this by Nevil Shute in his book Slide Rule. The immediate technical cause of the accident was the tearing of the fabric of the outer envelope; this fabric had apparently been embrittled by improper doping treatment. The real reason for the disaster was, however, pride and jealousy and political ambition. The Labour government's Air Minister, Lord Thompson, who carried the ultimate responsibility, was burnt to death in the accident, along with his valet and nearly fifty of the crew.

Nevil Shute's account of the events leading up to the accident corresponds extraordinarily closely in character with my own experience of rather comparable circumstances. One can at once recognize a certain atmosphere of Gadarene inevitability about the whole procedure. Under the pressure of pride and jealousy and ambition and political rivalry, attention is concentrated on the day-to-day details. The broad judgements, the generalship of engineering, end by being impossible. The whole thing becomes unstoppable and slides to disaster before one's eyes. Thus are the purposes of Zeus accomplished. People do not become immune from the classical or theological human weaknesses merely because they are operating in a technical situation, and several of these catastrophes have much of the drama and inevitability of Greek tragedy. It may be that some of our text-books ought to be written by people like Aeschylus or Sophocles – these writers were not humanists.
