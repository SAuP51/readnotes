## 0201. Inherently Safer Design: The Concept and Its Scope and Benefits

The main obstacle to innovative problem solving in petrochemical companies is over-conservatism in management.… Imaginative solutions to problems always run counter to the conventional wisdom of the firm.

— C. H. Kline1 

### 2.1 The Concept

The essence of the inherently safer approach to plant design is the avoidance of hazards rather than their control by added protective equipment. Although we generally think of safety in a comparative sense, one experienced practitioner 2 has made the distinction between safe design and safer design. He explains that with safe design, there are active safeguards to prevent the occurrence of hazardous events and to protect people and plant from the effects. With safer design, there are fewer hazards, fewer causes, and fewer people to be exposed to the effects.

All the ideas described in this book might be considered as examples of inherently safer design. However, as explained in Chapter 1, I use the phrase in a narrower sense to describe ways of eliminating large inventories of hazardous materials and hazardous equipment and operations, and this aspect is discussed in this and the next four chapters.

Since the explosion at Flixborough in 1974 in which 28 people were killed, there has been a profusion of papers on ways of preventing similar incidents from happening again. At one extreme, because Flixborough was a plant for the manufacture of nylon, the “back-to-nature” enthusiasts have suggested we abandon human-made fibers and use natural materials such as wool and cotton instead. They overlook the fact that the “accident content” of natural fibers is higher than that of human-made fibers, although in agricultural accidents people are killed one at a time and receive less publicity than those who are killed in the chemical industry. Flixborough may have been the price of nylon (to quote a television reporter), but the price of wool and cotton is higher. (The cost of any article is the cost of the labor used to make it, and the capital costs are other people’s labor. Agriculture is a low-wage industry, and thus there will be more labor in a woolen or cotton garment than in a synthetic one of the same cost. Because agriculture is also a high-accident industry, there will be more fatal accidents per woolen or cotton garment than per synthetic garment.)

Similarly, Bhopal, where over 2000 people were killed by a toxic gas release in 1984, was a plant for the manufacture of insecticides, and people understandably ask whether the price paid for insecticides is too high. But insecticides, by increasing food production, have saved far more lives than were lost at Bhopal.3 

However, Flixborough and Bhopal were not inevitable prices for nylon and insecticides, and there are many ways of making these plants safer and many lessons to be drawn from these tragedies. 4 Most of the papers and reports on the accidents have suggested the need for installation of more and better protective equipment such as gas detectors, emergency isolation valves, trips and alarms, scrubbers and flare stacks, fire protection and firefighting equipment, stronger buildings, and so on. The safety adviser has acquired a reputation as someone who adds to the cost and complexity of the plant. The added equipment is necessary, we do not doubt, but it is also expensive and complex.

Other papers have suggested that more attention be paid to plant layout and location and that there should be more regulations, a system of licensing, more and better safety advisers, and so on. All but a few of the papers and committees have overlooked the possibility of a better and cheaper solution to the problem.

Many years ago Henry Ford said, “What you don’t fit costs nothing and needs no maintenance.” Similarly, what you don’t have can’t leak. If we could design our plants so that they use so little hazardous material that it does not matter if it all leaks out, or use safer materials instead, or use the hazardous ones at lower temperatures and pressures or diluted by a safe solvent, we would avoid rather than solve many of our problems. These changes—described as intensification, substitution, and attenuation—produce plants that are inherently or intrinsically safer, whereas a conventional plant in which the hazards are kept under control is extrinsically safer.

The earlier papers on the subject used the term intrinsically safer, but inherently safer is now preferred because it avoids confusion with intrinsically safe, as used by electrical engineers, to describe a circuit with insufficient power to ignite a mixture of flammable gas, vapor, or dust with air.

I do not, of course, suggest that there should be any ban on plants that contain large inventories of hazardous materials—only discouragement. The development of alternative processes and equipment will take time and may sometimes prove impossible. When large inventories are unavoidable, we can, by good design and operation, keep them under control, but I do suggest that, in designing plants, we make a low inventory one of our aims. Usually, in the past, we have given little or no thought to the amount of material in the plant. We have accepted whatever inventory was called for by the design. If we set out to reduce the inventory, we will find that in many cases we can do so, as the remaining chapters show.

To use an analogy, if the meat of lions were good to eat or their skins made very good clothes, our farmers would be asked to farm lions, and they could do so. They would need cages around their fields instead of fences, but by good design and operations, they could make the chance of an escape very small. Only occasionally, as at Flixborough and Bhopal, will the lions break loose. But why keep lions when lambs will do instead?

Or, to use another analogy, the most dangerous items in our homes are stairs. More people are killed and injured by falling down stairs than in any other way. Traditional or extrinsically safer ways of controlling the hazard are to add handrails, train people to use them, make sure the carpet is secure, and keep the stairs free from junk. The inherently safer solution is to buy a one-story house. If this is too expensive, then a halfway course of action is possible: we can install a staircase with frequent landings so that no one can fall more than a few steps.

This simple analogy illustrates a point that will be emphasized later (Section 10.1.1): Many decisions about inherent safety have to be made early in design. It is too late to tell the builder when our house is complete that we do not want any stairs; it is too late to tell the architect when the drawings are complete. The decision to avoid stairs must be made right at the beginning of the design process, when we are first instructing our architect. The decision may affect the amount of land we need and thus the location of our new home.

Similarly, the greatest opportunities for development of an inherently safer chemical manufacturing process exist at the earliest stages of research and development, in the selection of the product synthesis route. 5 Inherent-safety solutions

must be checked for implementation at the basic design stage, but they must first be evaluated during conceptual design. 6 Notwithstanding the preference for early consideration, it is never too late to consider inherently safer alternatives. 7 There have been reports of inherent-safety enhancements to existing plants, such as the modification of a bromine raw-material-handling facility by replacing an existing bulk storage tank with cylinders.8

工厂设计本质上更安全的方法是避免危险，而不是通过增加防护设备来控制它们。尽管我们通常以比较的方式来考虑安全性，但有一位经验丰富的从业者对安全设计和更安全的设计做出了区分。他解释说，在安全设计中，有积极的安全防护措施来防止危险事件的发生，并保护人员和设备免受其影响。而在更安全的设计中，危险因素、引发因素以及暴露于危险影响下的人员更少。

本书中描述的所有理念都可以视为本质上更安全的设计示例。然而，如第 1 章所解释的，我用这个短语来更狭义地描述消除大量危险物料库存和危险设备及操作的方法，本章及接下来的四章将讨论这个方面。

自从 1974 年 Flixborough 爆炸造成 28 人死亡以来，已经出现了大量关于如何防止类似事件再次发生的论文。在极端情况下，因为 Flixborough 是一个尼龙生产厂，所以「回归自然」的热衷者建议我们放弃人造纤维，转而使用羊毛和棉花等天然材料。他们忽视了天然纤维的「事故含量」高于人造纤维，尽管在农业事故中人们是一个个地死亡，而且比在化工行业死亡的人获得的关注要少。Flixborough 可能是尼龙的代价（引用一位电视记者的话），但羊毛和棉花的代价更高。（任何物品的成本是制作它的劳动力的成本，资本成本是其他人的劳动力。农业是低工资行业，因此同样成本的羊毛或棉花服装中的劳动力比合成服装中的要多。由于农业也是高事故行业，所以每件羊毛或棉花服装的致命事故比每件合成服装的要多。）

同样，1984 年在 Bhopal，超过 2000 人因为有毒气体泄露而死亡，那是一个农药生产厂，人们理所当然地质疑农药的代价是否过高。但农药通过增加食品生产，已经挽救了比在 Bhopal 丧生的人更多的生命。

然而，Flixborough 和 Bhopal 并不是尼龙和农药必然的代价，有许多方法可以使这些工厂更安全，从这些悲剧中可以吸取许多教训。大部分关于这些事故的论文和报告都提出了需要安装更多更好的防护设备，如气体探测器、紧急隔离阀、旅行和警报、洗涤器和燃烧塔、火灾防护和灭火设备、更强大的建筑等。安全顾问已经获得了一个声誉，那就是他会增加工厂的成本和复杂性。这些额外的设备是必要的，我们无疑会有这样的需要，但它们也昂贵且复杂。

其他的论文建议应更多地关注工厂的布局和位置，并且应有更多的规定，一个许可证制度，更多和更好的安全顾问等等。除了少数几篇论文和委员会，几乎所有的论文和委员会都忽视了一个更好、更便宜的解决问题的可能性。

很多年前，Henry Ford 曾经说过：「你不装的东西不花钱，也不需要维护。」同样，你没有的东西就不会泄漏。如果我们可以设计我们的工厂，使它们使用的危险物料少到即使全部泄漏出来也没有关系，或者使用更安全的物料，或者在较低的温度和压力下使用危险物料，或者用安全溶剂稀释，我们就会避免而不是解决许多问题。这些改变 —— 被描述为加强、替代和衰减 —— 使得工厂本质上或固有地更安全，而传统的工厂中，危险被保持在控制之下，是外在的更安全。

早期关于这个主题的论文使用了「固有安全」的术语，但现在更倾向于使用「本质更安全」，因为它避免了与电气工程师使用的「固有安全」混淆，后者用来描述一个电路的功率不足以点燃易燃气体、蒸气或粉尘与空气的混合物。

当然，我并不建议禁止那些含有大量危险物料的工厂 —— 只是劝防。开发替代过程和设备需要时间，有时可能证明是不可能的。当大量库存无法避免时，我们可以通过良好的设计和操作来控制它们，但我确实建议在设计工厂时，我们应将低库存作为我们的目标之一。过去，我们通常对工厂中的物料量几乎没有考虑，只接受设计所需要的库存。但如果我们设定减少库存的目标，我们会发现在很多情况下我们能够做到，如后面的章节所展示的。

使用一个比喻，如果狮子的肉好吃，或者它们的皮可以制成非常好的衣服，我们的农民就会被要求去饲养狮子，他们可以做到。他们需要在田地周围设置笼子而不是围栏，但是通过良好的设计和操作，他们可以使狮子逃脱的可能性非常小。只有偶尔，像在 Flixborough 和 Bhopal 那样，狮子才会逃脱。但是，当羔羊也能满足需求的时候，为什么还要饲养狮子呢？

或者，再举一个例子，我们家里最危险的物品就是楼梯。有更多的人死于从楼梯上摔下来，或者在其它方式上受伤。传统的或者说是外在更安全的方法是添加扶手，训练人们使用它们，确保地毯稳定，并保持楼梯清洁。本质上更安全的解决方案是买一栋一层的房子。如果这太贵，那么可以选择一个折中的办法：我们可以安装一个有多个平台的楼梯，这样人们摔下来时也只会摔几步。

这个简单的比喻说明了一个稍后（10.1.1 节）将要强调的点：关于本质安全的许多决策必须在设计初期就做出。当我们的房子建成后告诉建筑师我们不需要楼梯，或者当图纸已经完成时告诉建筑师，都已经太晚了。避免楼梯的决定必须在设计过程一开始就做出，也就是我们第一次向建筑师说明需求时。这个决定可能会影响我们所需的土地面积，进而影响我们新家的位置。

同样，开发本质上更安全的化工生产过程的最大机会存在于研发的最早阶段，也就是在选择产品合成路线时。5 在基础设计阶段，必须检查本质安全解决方案是否实施，但首先必须在概念设计阶段进行评估。6 尽管我们更倾向于在早期考虑，但考虑本质更安全的替代方案永远不会太晚。7 已经有报告显示现有工厂进行了本质安全性的提升，例如通过替换现有的大容量储罐，修改了一家溴原料处理设施，使其使用气瓶。8

### 2.2 Defense in Depth

The prevention of accidents is based on defense in depth. If one line of defense fails, there are others in reserve. To put inherently safer design in context, the main lines of defense against leaks of flammable materials are described below. The first four steps also help prevent leaks of toxic or corrosive materials or minimize their effects.

1 Avoidance. Avoid the hazard by one of the methods already described; i.e., use so little hazardous material that leaks do not matter (intensification), use safer materials instead (substitution), or use hazardous materials in a safer form (attenuation).

2 Containment. We should design, construct, operate, and maintain equipment so that the chance of a leak is minimal.

Most of the materials that we handle in the oil and chemical industries are not flammable or explosive in themselves, but only when mixed with air (or oxygen) in certain proportions. To prevent fires and explosions, we have therefore to keep the air out of the plant and keep the fuel in the plant. The former is easy, for most equipment operates at pressure; nitrogen blanketing is widely used to keep air out of low-pressure equipment such as tanks, stacks, and centrifuges. Unfortunately, containment normally has to be broken during maintenance, which is the source of many accidents.

3 Detection and warning. Promptly detect any leaks that occur and warn people who are not needed to deal with the leak so that they can leave the area.

4 Isolation. Use emergency isolation valves to isolate the leaks. We cannot install valves on the lines leading to all equipment that might leak, but we can and should install them when experience shows that the chance of a leak is high or the amount of material that could leak out is large. An example of the former is lines leading to or from very hot or cold pumps; an example of the latter is lines leading from the bases of large distillation columns.9 

5 Dispersion. Disperse the leaking material by open construction supplemented, if necessary, by steam or water curtains. Secondary containment (for example, by a building) is sometimes used to confine leaking material. This is the right policy for radioactive materials, for pollutants, or for toxic materials that may not disperse before they reach people who do not know how to react to them. This is not a suitable policy for flammable materials because the concentration in the building may soon rise above the lower flammable limit, and an explosion may then occur.

6 Removal, as far as possible, of known sources of ignition. Removal of known sources of ignition is one of the weaker lines of defense, and we should never rely on it. So little energy is needed to ignite a mixture of flammable vapor and air that explosions may still occur even though we have tried to remove all known sources of ignition.10 

7 Protection of people and equipment against the effects of fire and explosion. As discussed in Chapter 1, passive methods of protection are better than active ones. For example, it is better to protect equipment from fire by insulation than by water spray. The insulation does not have to be commissioned and offers an immediate barrier against fire, whereas someone or something has to activate a water spray system and may not do so. If emergency cooling is needed, convection or gravity flow is better than pumped flow.

8 Provision of firefighting facilities. A castle falls to the enemy. The moat had silted up and the outer wall had crumbled, but no one worried because the inner wall was impregnable. When it failed or someone left a gate open, there was nothing to fall back on.

Similarly, in industry, a common failing is to ignore the outer lines of defense because the inner ones are considered impregnable. When they fail, there is nothing to fall back on. Some companies have not worried about leaks of flammable gas because they had, they believed, removed all sources of ignition so that leaks could not ignite. When an unsuspected source of ignition turned up, an explosion occurred. 10 More often, companies have not worried about large inventories of hazardous materials because they knew, they thought, how to prevent leaks and deal with any that occurred. When they were proved wrong, a fire or explosion occurred or people were killed by toxic gas or vapor.

Effective loss prevention is based on strong outer defenses, i.e., on getting rid of our hazards when we can rather than controlling them by added equipment that may fail or may be neglected. “It is hubris to imagine we can infallibly prevent a thermodynamically favoured event.”11 

防止事故的基础是深度防御。如果一道防线失效，还有其他的备用防线。为了将本质上更安全的设计放在上下文中，下面将描述防止易燃材料泄漏的主要防线。前四个步骤也有助于防止有毒或腐蚀性材料的泄漏或最小化其影响。

1 避免。通过已经描述的方法之一避免危险；即，使用的危险物质如此之少，以至于泄漏并不重要（强化），而是使用更安全的材料（替代），或以更安全的形式使用危险材料（衰减）。

2 隔离。我们应设计、建造、操作和维护设备，使得泄漏的机会最小。

我们在石油和化学工业中处理的大多数材料本身不会燃烧或爆炸，只有当它们与空气（或氧气）以某种比例混合时才会这样。为了防止火灾和爆炸，我们因此需要将空气排除在工厂之外，并将燃料保持在工厂之内。前者很容易，因为大多数设备都在压力下运行；氮气充填广泛用于防止空气进入如储罐、堆栈和离心机等低压设备。遗憾的是，在维护期间通常必须打破隔离，这是许多事故的源头。

3 检测和警告。立即检测到任何发生的泄漏，并警告不需要处理泄漏的人，以便他们可以离开该区域。

4 隔离。使用紧急隔离阀隔离泄漏。我们无法在所有可能泄漏的设备的连线上安装阀门，但是当经验表明泄漏的机会很高或可能泄漏出的物料量很大时，我们可以并且应该安装它们。前者的一个例子是通往或来自非常热或冷的泵的线路；后者的一个例子是从大型蒸馏塔底部引出的线路。9 

5 分散。如果必要，通过开放的建筑补充分散泄漏的材料，或使用蒸汽或水帘。有时会使用二次隔离（例如，通过建筑）来限制泄漏的材料。这是对放射性材料、污染物或可能在达到不知道如何应对它们的人之前不会分散的有毒材料的正确政策。这不适合易燃材料，因为建筑内的浓度可能很快上升到低燃点以上，然后可能会发生爆炸。

6 尽可能移除已知的点火源。移除已知的点火源是防线中较弱的一环，我们绝不应依赖它。需要引发易燃蒸汽和空气混合物的能量如此之小，即使我们已经尝试移除所有已知的点火源，仍然可能发生爆炸。10 

7 保护人员和设备免受火灾和爆炸的影响。如第1章所述，被动保护方法比主动保护方法更好。例如，通过绝缘而非水喷雾保护设备免受火灾的影响更好。绝缘不需要启动，并立即提供防火屏障，而某人或某事必须激活水喷雾系统，可能不会这样做。如果需要紧急冷却，对流或重力流比泵流更好。

8 提供消防设施。城堡陷入敌人之手。护城河已经淤塞，外墙已经倒塌，但是没有人担心，因为内墙是坚不可摧的。当它失败或有人留下一扇门打开时，没有可以依赖的东西。

同样，在工业中，一个常见的失误是忽视外部防线，因为内部防线被认为是坚不可摧的。当它们失败时，没有可以依赖的东西。一些公司没有担心易燃气体的泄漏，因为他们认为，他们已经移除了所有的点火源，以便泄漏不能点燃。当出现意想不到的点火源时，就发生了爆炸。10 更常见的是，公司没有担心大量危险材料的库存，因为他们知道，他们认为，如何防止泄漏并处理任何发生的泄漏。当他们被证明是错误的时候，就会发生火灾或爆炸，或者有人被有毒气体或蒸汽杀死。

有效的损失预防基于强大的外部防御，即，尽可能地摆脱我们的危险，而不是通过可能失败或可能被忽视的增加设备来控制它们。"想象我们可以无误地防止热力学有利的事件是傲慢的。"11

### 2.3 The Scope

Applying the concept of inherently safer design at the very beginning of a project, we may be able to choose a safe product instead of a hazardous one. When a process is being chosen, we may be able to choose a route that avoids the use of hazardous raw materials or intermediates (Section 4.2).

Once the chemistry has been decided and we are developing the flowsheet, we may be able to choose or develop intensified equipment such as reactors, distillation columns, and heat exchangers that do not require large quantities of materials in progress (Sections 3.1 through 3.5). It may be possible to manage without intermediate storage, possibly by siting production and consuming plants near each other (Section 3.6), and to avoid flammable heat-transfer fluids or refrigerants (Section 4.1).

With detailed design, we may be able to reduce inventories by the application of well-known methods (Section 3.7). The most important inventories to reduce or avoid are those of flashing flammable or toxic liquids, i.e., liquids under pressure above their atmospheric pressure boiling points. Liquids below their boiling points produce very little little vapor; gases leak at a lower mass rate than liquids through a hole of a given size and are often dispersed by jet mixing. Flashing liquids, however, leak at about the same rate as cooler liquids and then turn into a mixture of vapor and spray (Figure 2.1). The spray, if fine, is just as flammable, explosive, or toxic as the vapor and can be spread as easily as the wind. Most vapor-cloud explosions and most major toxic incidents have been the results of leaks of flashing flammable liquids. 12 Flixborough and Bhopal were both due to leaks of flashing liquids. At Bhopal, the liquid was not normally above its boiling point, but addition of water to a storage tank caused a runaway reaction to occur.

The scope of inherently safer design is thus seen to extend throughout the process-design life cycle. This is a recurrent theme in these pages, and also in the numerous inherently safer design resource publications that have appeared in the literature over the past 10 years or so. 13–22 These various review articles and texts contain a wealth of examples of inherent-safety application, some of which appear in later chapters of this book.

Figure 2.1 Leak rates through a 2-in. hole. (Petrol is the U.K. term for gasoline.)

将本质上更安全的设计理念应用在项目的一开始，我们就可能选择安全的产品，而不是危险的产品。当选择一个流程时，我们可能可以选择避免使用危险的原材料或中间产品的途径（第 4.2 节）。

一旦化学反应确定下来，我们在开发流程图时，可能能选择或开发强化的设备，如反应器、蒸馏塔和热交换器，这些设备不需要大量的在制品（第 3.1 到 3.5 节）。可能无需中间存储，可能通过将生产和消费工厂相互邻近来实现（第 3.6 节），并避免使用可燃的传热液体或制冷剂（第 4.1 节）。

在详细设计时，我们可能通过应用众所周知的方法来减少库存（第 3.7 节）。最重要的库存是那些闪蒸易燃或有毒液体的库存，也就是，处于高于其常压沸点压力下的液体。低于其沸点的液体产生的蒸汽非常少；气体通过给定大小的孔洞泄漏的质量速率低于液体，通常会被喷射混合所分散。然而，闪蒸液体以与较冷液体大致相同的速率泄漏，然后转化为蒸汽和喷雾的混合物（图 2.1）。如果喷雾非常细，就像蒸汽一样，它就易燃、易爆或有毒，可以像风一样轻易地传播。大多数蒸汽云爆炸和大多数主要的有毒事件都是由闪蒸易燃液体的泄漏造成的。12 Flixborough 和 Bhopal 的事故都是由闪蒸液体的泄漏引起的。在 Bhopal，液体通常不会超过其沸点，但是向储罐中加水引发了失控反应。

因此，本质上更安全的设计的范围可见需要贯穿整个过程设计生命周期。这在这些页面中是一个反复出现的主题，也是在过去 10 年左右的文献中出现的大量本质更安全设计资源出版物中的一个主题。13-22 这些各种评论文章和文本包含了大量的内在安全应用实例，其中一些将在这本书的后续章节中出现。

### 2.4 The Benefits of Inherently Safer Design

Inherently safer plants are usually cheaper than conventional ones because they do not need so much additional protective equipment. It is difficult to say how much cheaper, for designers do not keep records of safety costs. Safety should not be something added afterward to a plant, like a coat of paint, but an integral part of design. If a design engineer is asked to list the cost of the safety features on a plant, the designer usually lists the newer features that were the subject of debate but not the cost of well-established safety features such as relief valves. These are considered basic engineering and taken for granted.

At a guess, we would save at least 5%, often 10%, of the capital cost of most new plants if we could reduce our inventories of hazardous materials and thus reduce expenditure on added protective equipment such as trips and alarms, fire and leak detectors, emergency isolation valves, fire insulation, water spray, and firefighting equipment. On some plants the savings would be much greater.

Equally important would be reductions in the cost of testing and maintaining the equipment. For instruments, this is roughly equal to the installed capital cost. As a result, instruments cost twice what you think. In addition, much management time is, or should be, taken up by monitoring to make sure that the protective equipment is operated, tested, and maintained correctly. If plants can be made inherently safer, this effort can be reduced. Also, it will be easier to persuade the authorities and the public that the plant will not blow up or poison the neighborhood. It will be easier to find a site for the plant, and the equipment may not have to be spread so far apart (Section 10.6).

These and several other cost parameters were considered in a recent analysis of the “real cost of process safety.” 23 This hypothetical study was conducted for a simple process of making salt solution in open vats by dissolving sodium chloride in a highly hazardous chemical, dihydrogen monoxide (i.e., water). Although obviously somewhat tongue in cheek, the cost benefits of inherent-safety applications are well made by the authors.24 

If inventories can be reduced, the biggest saving will probably come from a reduction in the size of the plant items (reactors, distillation columns, heat exchangers, storage vessels, etc.) and a corresponding reduction in the size of the pipework, structures, and foundations. Much of the capital cost for a chemical plant is related to its civil engineering structural design and components.25  Compare the reductions in cost achieved in other industries by reductions in size. Compare modern computers and radios with earlier models or a modern electric pump with a steam-driven beam-pumping engine. Much of the pressure for intensification has come from those primarily interested in reducing costs, and because intensification produces such big reductions in cost, it should be our first choice before substitution or attenuation. The finance director and the process-safety engineer can be allies! Consider the title of Reference 25: Process Intensification Magnifies Profits; surely such a headline would catch the eye of any business manager.

The plants we are now designing, with their large vessels and inventories, may seem to us to be in the forefront of technology. Perhaps they are really the chemical engineering equivalent of a beam engine, and our grandchildren will be starting a society to preserve the few remaining large distillation columns so that, like the surviving beam engines, they can be shown to the public on weekends and circulated on public holidays.

Finally, another possible advantage of substantial reductions in size and cost, by analogy with computers, is that if large reductions can be achieved, then overcapacity may be economic and will simplify control problems (Section 10.1.4).

Inherently safer design is not simply an isolated improvement, but a desirable part of the total packet of changes that the chemical industry needs to make for the twenty-first century. Our plants are too hazardous, too expensive, and too complicated and use too much energy, need too much maintenance, and produce too much pollution and waste. Inherently safer design, especially intensification, can help us to reduce these limitations (Figure 2.2). Simplification, and therefore reduction in cost and maintenance, comes about because less additional safety equipment is needed. If we can intensify, the smaller size of the equipment reduces cost directly. If we can reduce the recycles of unconverted raw material (“free rides”), we will save energy and further reduce cost (Section 3.2.4). The principles of inherently safer design can be applied to prevention of pollution and waste reduction. As described in Chapter 1, many companies talk about inherent SHE (safety, health, and environment).

Figure 2.2 Inherent safety is not an isolated (although desirable) change but, rather, part of a package of improvements needed by the process industries.

Sir Maurice Hodgson, former chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), has written, “Certainly in ICI we are clear that our future plants will have to contain less ironmongery for a given capacity, be less energy-consuming and be more productive per unit of everything. Process intensification, energy-saving technology, better design and control systems are the means.”26 

When I worked in industry, my research colleagues sometimes complained about the high cost of extrinsic safety features. They suggested that by asking for so much added safety I was making their designs uneconomic. I replied that the added safety was necessary because they invented such poor processes—poor in other ways besides safety. It is not economic to push large inventories round and round, giving them a “free ride.” If engineers could invent better processes, we would not need to add so much safety equipment. See the comments from an experienced process designer at the end of Chapter 4.

In the fourth century a theologian wrote that “all great controversies depend on both sides sharing one false premise.” 27 A false premise is shared by the operating staff who want to add more protective equipment to their plants and the designers who say, “We’ve spent enough; the plant is now as safe as it needs to be.” We do not have to spend more money to make the plant safer; if we consider safety early in design, we can avoid many hazards. Expressed from a probabilistic risk perspective, inherently safer design is a way to decrease the uncertainty about whether harmful events will take place.28 

Appendix: “The Lady or the Tiger?”—A New Version of an Old Tale

A king offered a challenge to three young men. Each would be put in a room with two doors and could open both. If he opened one, a hungry tiger would come out—the fiercest and most cruel that could be obtained—that would tear him to pieces. If he opened the other, a young lady would come out, the most suitable to his years and station that His Majesty could select from amongst his fair subjects.

The first young man refused the challenge. He lived safe and died chaste.

The second young man hired risk-assessment consultants. They collected all the available data on lady and tiger populations. They brought in sophisticated equipment to listen for growling and detect the faintest whiff of perfume. They completed checklists. They developed a utility function and assessed the young man’s risk aversion. Naturally this took time (and money). The young man, now no longer quite so young, began to worry that he would soon be no longer able to enjoy the lady. Finally, he asked the consultants to recommend a course of action. He opened the optimal door and was eaten by a low-probability tiger.

The third young man took a course in tiger handling.29

The moral of the story (for those who like to have parables explained) is as follows:

The young men represent us all, the tiger the hazards of industry, and the lady the benefits industry brings to humanity. Like the first young man, society can leave the game. We can manage without chemical plants, the benefits they bring, and the risks they carry. Like the second young man, we can (and do) try to assess the risks and open the safest doors, but we can never be completely sure that our assessments are correct and that an accident will not occur. When possible, we should try, like the third young man, to change the work situation and to choose designs or methods of working that minimize the hazard.

从本质上更安全的工厂通常比传统工厂更便宜，因为它们不需要那么多额外的防护设备。很难说能便宜多少，因为设计师不会记录安全成本。安全性不应该是事后加到工厂上的东西，像一层油漆，而应该是设计的一个整体部分。如果要求设计工程师列出工厂上安全特性的成本，设计师通常会列出较新的特性，这些特性是讨论的主题，但不会列出像安全阀这样的老旧安全特性的成本。这些被视为基本的工程学，被视为理所当然的。

猜测一下，如果我们能减少我们的危险物质库存，从而减少在额外的防护设备如旅行和报警器、火灾和泄漏探测器、紧急隔离阀、防火绝缘、水喷雾和消防设备上的支出，我们至少能节省大多数新工厂的资本成本的 5%，通常是 10%。在某些工厂，节省的金额会更多。

同样重要的是减少测试和维护设备的成本。对于仪器，这大约等于安装的资本成本。因此，仪器的成本是你认为的两倍。此外，很多管理时间是，或者应该是，用来监控以确保防护设备得到操作、测试和正确的维护。如果工厂能被制造得本质上更安全，这些努力就可以减少。此外，会更容易说服权威机构和公众，工厂不会爆炸或者污染周边环境。找到工厂地点会更容易，设备可能不需要分布得那么分散（第 10.6 节）。

这些和一些其他的成本参数都在最近一项关于「过程安全的真实成本」23 的分析中被考虑到。这项假设性的研究是为一个简单的过程进行的，该过程通过在一种高度危险的化学物质，二氢氧化物（也就是，水）中溶解氯化钠来制作盐溶液。虽然明显有些玩笑的成分，但作者很好地阐述了本质安全应用的成本效益。24

如果库存可以减少，可能最大的节省将来自于减小工厂设备（反应器、蒸馏塔、热交换器、储存容器等）的规模和相应减小管道、结构和基础设施的规模。化学工厂的大部分资本成本与其土木工程结构设计和组件有关。25 比较其他行业通过减小规模达到的成本减少。比较现代电脑和收音机与早期模型，或者现代电泵与蒸汽驱动的梁泵。大部分强化的压力来自于那些主要关心降低成本的人，因为强化可以带来如此大的成本减少，它应该是我们在替换或削弱之前的首选。财务总监和过程安全工程师可以是盟友！考虑参考文献 25 的标题：过程强化放大利润；这样的标题肯定会吸引任何业务经理的注意。

我们现在设计的工厂，有着大型的设备和库存，可能看起来像是在技术的最前沿。也许它们实际上只是化学工程的一个梁式发动机，并且我们的孙子们会开启一个社会，保存下来的少数大型蒸馏塔，这样，就像存活下来的梁式发动机一样，他们可以在周末向公众展示，并在公众假日传播。

最后，通过与电脑的类比，显著减小规模和成本的另一个可能优点是，如果可以实现大幅度的减小，那么过量的产能可能是经济的，并会简化控制问题（第 10.1.4 节）。

本质上更安全的设计不仅仅是一个孤立的改进，而是化学工业需要为二十一世纪做出的整体改变包的一个可取的部分。我们的工厂太危险，太贵，太复杂，使用太多能源，需要太多维护，产生太多污染和废弃物。本质上更安全的设计，尤其是强化，可以帮助我们减少这些限制（图 2.2）。简化，因此降低成本和维护，是因为需要更少的额外安全设备。如果我们可以强化，设备的小型化直接降低了成本。如果我们可以减少未转化原料的循环（「免费搭车」），我们将节省能源并进一步降低成本（第 3.2.4 节）。本质更安全设计的原则可以应用于防止污染和减少废弃物。如在第 1 章所述，许多公司都在谈论内在的 SHE（安全、健康和环境）。

图 2.2 内在安全并不是一个孤立的（尽管是理想的）改变，而是流程工业所需的一系列改进的一部分。

前帝国化学工业（ICI）的主席 Sir Maurice Hodgson 写道：「在 ICI 我们非常清楚，我们未来的工厂必须要在给定的产能下有更少的铁器，消耗更少的能源，以及每单位生产的产品更多。工艺强化、节能技术、更好的设计和控制系统是达到这个目标的手段。」26

当我在工业界工作时，我的研究同事有时会抱怨额外安全措施的高昂成本。他们建议，由于我要求添加如此多的安全性，我正在使他们的设计变得不经济。我回答说，添加的安全性是必要的，因为他们发明的这些流程如此差劣 - 在安全性以外的其他方式上也是如此。将大量的库存不断地转来转去，给它们一个「免费搭车」的机会，这并不经济。如果工程师能发明更好的流程，我们就不需要添加那么多的安全设备。请参阅第四章末尾一位经验丰富的流程设计师的评论。

在四世纪，一位神学家写道，「所有的大争议都取决于双方共享一个错误的前提。」27 运行人员希望向他们的工厂添加更多保护设备，设计师说，「我们已经花费足够了，现在的工厂已经足够安全。」这是一个错误的前提。我们不必花费更多的钱来使工厂更安全；如果我们在设计初期就考虑安全性，我们可以避免许多危险。从概率风险的角度来看，内在更安全的设计是一种降低有害事件发生不确定性的方法。28

附录：「公主还是老虎？」—— 一个老故事的新版本

一个国王向三个年轻人提出了挑战。每个人都将被放入一个有两扇门的房间，可以打开两扇门。如果他打开一扇门，一只饥饿的老虎将会出来 - 他可以得到的最凶猛、最残忍的老虎 - 会将他撕成碎片。如果他打开另一扇门，一个年轻的女士会出来，这是国王从他的公民中挑选出的最适合他的年龄和地位的女士。

第一个年轻人拒绝了挑战。他安全地生活并死于贞洁。

第二个年轻人雇佣了风险评估顾问。他们收集了关于女性和老虎人口的所有可用数据。他们带来了精密的设备，以便听到咆哮并检测到最微弱的香味。他们完成了清单。他们开发了一种效用函数并评估了年轻人的风险厌恶。自然，这需要时间（和金钱）。年轻人，现在已经不再那么年轻了，开始担心他很快就无法再享受那个女人。最后，他请顾问推荐一个行动方案。他打开了最优门，被一个低概率的老虎吃了。

第三个年轻人参加了老虎处理课程。29

这个故事的寓意（对于那些喜欢解读寓言的人）是：

年轻人代表了我们所有人，老虎代表了工业的危险，女士代表了工业给人类带来的好处。就像第一个年轻人一样，社会可以退出游戏。我们可以在没有化工厂，它们带来的好处，以及它们带来的风险的情况下生活。就像第二个年轻人，我们可以（也确实是）试图评估风险并打开最安全的门，但我们永远不能完全确定我们的评估是否正确，事故是否不会发生。只要可能，我们应该像第三个年轻人那样，改变工作环境，选择最小化危险的设计或工作方法。
