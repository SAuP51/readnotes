## 0301. Intensification

In a healthy society, engineering gets smarter and smarter; in gangster states it gets bigger and bigger.

This chapter describes ways in which the amount of hazardous material in plants and storage has been, or could be, reduced with consequent increase in safety and reduction in cost, as discussed in Chapter 2. Different unit operations are discussed in turn. However, intensification (minimization) can also come about by combining operations (Sections 3.2.8 and 7.8).

### 3.1 Process Intensification

The term process intensification (PI) has become firmly established in the vocabulary of chemical process engineering researchers and practitioners. Process intensification results in substantial improvements in the scale, cleanliness, energy efficiency, cost effectiveness, and safety of units designed to effect physical changes or molecular transformations in materials. Size reduction of unit operations and chemical plants is a key goal of process intensification.

Quoting from the publisher’s description of the latest book in this area, “PI … is now reaching a maturity that is seeing [these] concepts applied to a wide range of processes and technologies.” 1 Evidence of the maturity of process intensification can be found in the existence of a journal devoted to advances in the field (Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification), as well as a Process Intensification Network, 2 organized by the authors of Reference 1 and hosted by Newcastle University, U.K.

As mentioned in Chapter 2, the motivation for process intensification often comes from the economic side of the business equation. In today’s world, the economic need for PI is increasingly framed within the context of global competitiveness and sustainable development. 3,4 Sometimes, however, the driving force behind PI is the attendant safety benefits, as seems the case with the recent IMPULSE project (Integrated Process Units with Locally Structured Elements). 5 In this work, smaller and more efficient devices such as microreactors and compact heat exchangers are expected to present a lower risk of fire and explosion, as well as fewer harmful emissions, than traditional plant equipment.

Reference 5 concludes with the statement that, while major releases and hazards are less likely for IMPULSE plants, the potential for operator exposure and minor problems (e.g., pump leakage) may be greater. This remark is a helpful reminder that inherent safety involves both change, which must be managed, and tradeoffs, which must be assessed. No single approach can be expected to cover all issues that arise during process design and operation. In this regard, Etchells 6 has provided a useful listing of the potential problem areas, as well as the benefits, of process intensification.

Potential safety benefits of process intensification include the following: 6 

1. Reduction of inventories of hazardous materials and the consequences of process failures.

2. Reduction in the number of process operations, leading to fewer transfer operations and less pipework (thus reducing leakage).

3. Containment of explosion overpressures in smaller vessels, so that passive and active devices (e.g., rupture disks and automatic suppression systems, respectively) may not be needed.

4. Reduction in the number of process incidents during transient conditions because of fewer startups and shutdowns with continuous, intensified plant.

5. Less variable (and easier to control) heat evolution than in batch reactors when dealing with exothermic reactions.

6. Easier-to-achieve heat transfer because of the enhanced specific surface area of continuous, intensified plant, thus reducing the potential for runaway reactions.

Potential safety issues related to process intensification include the following: 6 

1. Requirement for high temperatures and pressures, and high-energy inputs. For example, the use of microwaves has been reported in intensified desorption processes for the regeneration of adsorbents used in the control of organic vapor emissions.7 

2. Increase in process complexity and an accompanying increase in the complexity of control systems.

3. Heightened concerns with respect to control and monitoring due to shorter residence times for many intensified processes.

4. Higher potential for equipment failure or operator error if the process pipework becomes more complex.

5. Increased rate of energy release due to enhanced reaction rates as a result of improved mixing.

6. Introduction of a new ignition source with the combination of rotating equipment and friction-sensitive materials.

7. Overheating of thermally unstable materials on complex heated surfaces subject to fouling.

8. High throughput leading to the possibility of rapid accumulation downstream of off-spec products.

9. Closer proximity of people to smaller plant.

Not all of the stated benefits or concerns will occur in a given application of process intensification. The purpose in raising these points here is twofold. First, they remind us that assessment and management of process risks are comprehensive undertakings that are crucial to any commercial endeavor. Second, they offer a challenge to the reader while reviewing the examples in the remainder of this chapter to bear in mind the tradeoffs often presented by inherent-safety application.

### 3.2 Reaction

No unit operation, except storage, offers more scope for reduction of inventory than reaction. Many continuous reactors, such as liquid-phase oxidation reactors, contain large inventories of highly flammable liquids, and leaks from these reactors have caused many fires and explosions, 8,9 including that at Flixborough.10,11 

Reactors can be arranged in the following hierarchy of (usually) increasing inventory and decreasing inherent safety:

In a batch reactor, all the reactants are added before reaction starts. In a semibatch reactor, one (or more) of the reactants is added and the final reactant(s) added gradually as reaction proceeds; reaction takes place at once, and an unreacted mixture cannot accumulate unless mixing fails or the catalyst is consumed (Sections 3.2.7 and 6.2.2).

Each process should be considered on its merits, for there are exceptions to the general rules. For example, according to Englund, 12 for the copolymerization of styrene and butadiene, a semibatch reactor is safer than a batch one, but a continuous reactor may not be the safest because some designs contain more unreacted raw material than semibatch reactors.

When possible, vapor-phase reactors should be developed in place of liquidphase ones because the density of the vapor is less and the leak rate through a hole of a given size is lower (Figure 3.1 and Section 3.2.6). Of course, a gas at very high pressure with a density similar to that of a liquid is as hazardous as a liquid.

Figure 3.1 Types of reactors.

As a rule, reactors, of all types, are large not because a large output is desired, but because conversion is low, reaction is slow, or both.

3.2.1 Conversion Is Low

When conversion is low, most of the throughput has to be recovered and recycled, which increases the plant inventory.

In theory, there should be no need for large reactors. If 20,000 tonnes/yr of product are needed, it can all pass through a 2-in. (5 cm) diameter pipe if one assumes a specific gravity of 0.8 and a linear velocity of 0.5 m/s, which is not particularly fast 13 (Figure 3.2). Because conversion is low, most plants for the manufacture of 20,000 tonnes/year contain far bigger pipelines.

If 1000 tonnes/year of product are needed, then in theory it can all pass through a 0.4-in. (1 cm) diameter line. Instead of a batch reactor we should consider a continuous reactor made from narrow-bore pipe. Heat transfer and mixing are effective in small pipes.

The size of process pipes is a measure of the improvement theoretically possible. The ratio:

has an ideal value of 1. The actual value (the “free-ride” or free-load index) is often 10 or even 20.

Figure 3.2 A pipe of this internal diameter can handle the passage of 20,000 tonnes/year.

We have become so used to giving our raw materials “free rides” that we may no longer see that it is inefficient and unsafe or that it reflects on our abilities as chemists or chemical engineers. The “free ride” indices for a company’s plants should be displayed at the entrance to its research department as a reminder of the scope for possible improvement, and the indices ought to be known to managers and directors. Regulators should ask for the value when visiting a plant or commenting on application for permission to build a new plant.

When one of my sons was 4 years old, he played miniature golf for the first time. He was halfway round before he realized that the winner is the one with the lowest score, not the highest, which is so different from all the other games he had played. Similarly, the company that will win in safety and economy is the one with the lowest “free ride” index.

3.2.2 Reaction Is Slow

Reactions are slow either because the mixing is poor or because the reaction is inherently slow. The former is the more common situation, and thus better mixing will reduce reaction volume, as discussed in this section. If the reaction is inherently slow, it may be possible to speed it up by increasing pressure, temperature, or both, or by developing a better catalyst. In theory, if this cannot be done, a tubular reactor can be made very long, though there may be practical difficulties. Tubular reactors should always be considered as an alternative to pot reactors, continuous or batch. Their integrity is high, and leaks can be stopped by closing a remotely operated isolation valve in the line. If desired, several such valves along the length of a tubular reactor can limit a spillage to any desired amount, say 5 or 10 tonnes, and the chance of a serious fire, explosion, or toxic incident is reduced (Section 3.2.7 and Figure 3.3). Continuous pot reactors rarely leak, but they can empty quickly if large inlet and exit lines fail.

Another advantage of tubular reactors is that, compared with stirred reactors, there is less variation in mixing rate and thus in product quality. In stirred vessels, mixing rates vary widely. The energy dissipation, a measure of the efficiency of mixing, can be a hundred times greater near the agitator blade than at the edge of the vessel. 14 Liquids as thick as porridge with entrained solids can be passed through tubular reactors if the flow rate is adjusted to maintain plug flow.15 

An alternative to a very long tubular reactor is a loop reactor, a tubular reactor with continuous addition of reactants and removal of products. Loop reactors have been used for manufacturing polymers from aqueous suspensions of monomers16  and for chlorinating an organic compound. In the latter case, compared with a batch process, 43% more output was obtained from 30% of the reactor volume, with increased efficiency. 17 There is another example in Section 5.1.2.

The remaining sections include examples of processes that have been intensified by a change to once-through tubular reactors.

The heat loss from tubular reactors could be increased by using flattened tubes. For example, a flat tube with 4-in. × 0.8-in. internal dimensions has the same cross section as a tube of 2-in. bore but with 50% more surface area. Some animals, such as tapeworms, have increased their surface area per unit mass in this way. 18 (Others have done so by developing lungs; see Table 3.1.)

Figure 3.3 Processes for the manufacture of ethylene oxide derivatives.

In trying to reduce the size of liquid-filled continuous or batch pot reactors, we should beware of compromises that are worse than either extreme. A very small reactor operating at high temperature and pressure may be inherently safe because it contains so little material; even if all of it leaks out, a serious incident is impossible or unlikely. A large reactor operating at or near atmospheric temperature and pressure, or at a lower temperature, may be safe for different reasons. Because the pressure is low, leaks will be small and infrequent, and because the temperature is low, the leaking liquid will produce little vapor. This is an example of attenuation, not intensification. A compromise solution (moderate temperature, pressure, and volume) may combine the worst features of the extremes. If there is a leak, the pressure may be high enough to produce a large leak rate, the temperature high enough to cause significant evaporation, and the inventory high enough to create a serious fire, explosion, or toxic incident (Figure 3.4). Compromises are not always better than extremes. (When I lectured to students, I used to add that this applies to engineering, not politics.)

The high temperature and pressure in the first reactor may increase the chance of a small leak, but this may be a price worth paying to make large leaks impossible.

3.2.3 Nitroglycerin Production

Nitroglycerin production provides one of the best examples of the reductions in reactor inventory that can be achieved by redesign. Nitroglycerin (NG) is made from glycerin and a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids according to the following equation:

The sulfuric acid does not take part in the reaction. The reaction is very exothermic, and, if the heat is not removed by cooling and stirring, an uncontrollable reaction is followed by explosive decomposition of the NG.

Figure 3.4 The effect of varying the conditions in a liquid-phase pot reactor.

The reaction was originally carried out batchwise in large stirred pots containing about a tonne of material. The operators had to watch the temperature closely, and to make sure they did not fall asleep they sat on one-legged stools (Figure 3.5). If they fell asleep, they fell off. (The stools might usefully be revived in lecture theaters and conference halls.) The photograph was taken about 1890, but the process continued in use until the 1950s in the United Kingdom and even longer in other countries.

Figure 3.5 The old batch process for the manufacture of nitroglycerin.

If we were asked to make this process safer, what would most of us do? We would add instruments to the reactor for measuring temperature, pressure, flows, rate of temperature rise, and so on, and then use these measurements to operate valves that stop flows, increase cooling, open vents and drains, and so on. By the time we had finished, the reactor would hardly be visible beneath the added protective equipment (Figure 7.1). However, when the NG engineers were asked to improve the process, they did not proceed in this way. They asked why the reactor had to contain so much material. The obvious answer was because the reaction is slow. But the chemical reaction is not slow. Once the molecules come together they react quickly. It is the chemical engineering—the mixing—that is slow. The engineers therefore designed a small, well-mixed reactor holding only about a kilogram of material that achieves about the same output as the batch reactor. The new reactor resembles a laboratory water pump. The rapid flow of acid through it creates a partial vacuum that sucks in the glycerin through a sidearm. Very rapid mixing occurs, and by the time the mixture leaves the reactor, reaction is complete (Figure 3.6). The residence time in the reactor has been reduced from 2 h to 2 min, thus enabling the operator to be protected by a blast wall of reasonable size. Similar changes were made to the later stages of the plant where the NG is washed and separated. The reactor, cooler, and centrifugal separator together contain 5 kg of NG.19 

The control system on the reactor is also inherently safer than conventional control. If the flow of acid falls, the flow of glycerin must fall in proportion without the intervention of a flow ratio controller or other instruments that might fail or be neglected.

Figure 3.6 shows the simple but effective way in which the reactor can be shut down. If a fault is detected, the solenoid is deenergized; the lead weight opens the plug valve; air enters the reactor, which destroys the partial vacuum created by the flowing acid; and the flow of glycerin stops and thus stops the reaction.

Another advantage of the continuous process is that heat evolution is uniform and thus easier to control. In the batch process, heat changes during the batch and is affected by the quality of the mixing.

Figure 3.6 Nitration injector in the Nobel AB process for manufacture of nitroglycerin. (From R. Bell, Loss Prevention in the Manufacture of Nitroglycerin, Process Optimization Symposium Series No. 100 [Rugby, U.K.: Institution of Chemical Engineers, 1987].)

The change made in nitroglycerin manufacture illustrates the statement made earlier that continuous processes are usually safer than batch ones. Not only does a batch reactor contain more material for a given output than a continuous one, but many more operations have to be carried out; thus, there are more opportunities for error.

In modern nitroglycerin plants, the product is usually transferred as an emulsion rather than as a pure liquid, which is an example of attenuation.

Intensification does not, of course, guarantee immunity from all accidents. Though we remove some hazards, others may remain. Explosions have occurred in continuous NG plants, though not so often as in batch plants. In one case, nitroglycerin and acid were separated in a centrifuge. The plastic NG exit line from the centrifuge swelled and choked, and the NG went down the acid line and settled on top of the acid. Two explosions occurred: one in the acid tank and the other in the recycle line leading out of the acid tank. The first explosion was probably triggered by vibration, and the second by the heat of the sun. Several men were killed. If we intensify equipment, pipelines may contain more inventory than the equipment; in any plant, materials may become hazardous if we let them get into the wrong place. Because NG detonates so easily, most explosives manufacturers have now discontinued its production.

In Hong Kong, the storage of explosives has been discouraged. If needed for quarrying, the raw materials are transported to the site and then mixed immediately before use. This technique is now widely used elsewhere.20 

For other nitration reactions, see Section 5.1.2.

3.2.4 Liquid-Phase Oxidation

The explosion at Flixborough in 1974 occurred in a continuous plant for the oxidation of cyclohexane with air at about 150°C and a gauge pressure of about 10 bar (150 psi) to a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, usually known as KA (ketone–aldehyde) mixture (Figure 4.6[a]), which is a stage in the manufacture of nylon. The inventory in the plant was large (200–500 tonnes has been quoted21 ) because reaction was slow and conversion low (about 6% per pass22 ). Much of the inventory was held in six large continuous pot reactors operated in series, and the rest was held in the equipment for recovering the product and recycling the unconverted raw material.

The first stage of the reaction (hydroperoxide formation) was slow because mixing was poor. Conversion was low for the same reason. If the oxygen concentration in the liquid is high, it can easily get too high (where it leaves the gas sparger), and then unwanted side reactions, including further oxidation of the cyclohexane, occur. 22 This cannot be tolerated because, in addition to purification costs, hydrocarbon costs are typically 80% of production costs.23 

Figure 3.7 Conventional gas–liquid stirred tank reactor. (From L. M. Litz, “A Novel Gas–Liquid Stirred Reactor,” Chem. Eng. Prog. 81, no. 11 [1985]: 36–39. Reproduced by permission of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.)

Litz has described a method of improving the mixing in gas–liquid reactors.24  In most such reactors, the gas is added through a sparger, and the liquid is stirred by a conventional stirrer (Figure 3.7). In the Litz design (Figure 3.8), the gas is added to the vapor space and a down-pumping impeller sucks the gas down and mixes it intimately with the liquid. Unreacted gas that escapes back into the vapor space is recirculated. The reactor was designed to increase output and efficiency, but, compared with a conventional reactor, less inventory is needed for a given output. Roby and Kingsley have described a development of this reactor.25 

Another method of improving the mixing is to add air, oxygen, or other gas to the liquid at several different points. This has been done by making the wall of the reactor from a porous ceramic membrane and allowing oxygen to diffuse through it.26 

Other methods of improving mixing are suggested in Section 3.2.8.

Figure 3.8 Advanced gas reactor. (From L. M. Litz, “A Novel Gas–Liquid Stirred Reactor,” Chem. Eng. Prog. 81, no. 11 [1985]: 36–39. Reproduced by permission of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.)

A problem that must be overcome in a new design of a reactor with higher conversion would be heat removal. The heat of reaction is considerable and is removed by evaporation and condensation of unconverted cyclohexane and its return to the reactor. About 7 tonnes have to be evaporated for every tonne that reacts. A higher conversion process would require a high heat-exchange area, which is a property of long, thin tubes. Looking further ahead, could some other method of heat removal be devised, such as electricity generation in fuel cells? 27

The second stage of the cyclohexane oxidation reaction, decomposition of the hydroperoxide, is inherently slow, and a long residence time is therefore required. Could this be achieved in a tubular reactor as discussed above? Higher temperatures would increase the rate of decomposition.

The leak at Flixborough was due to the failure of a bellows, which had been installed incorrectly in a way specifically forbidden in the manufacturer’s literature. A bellows is unfriendly equipment because it cannot tolerate incorrect installation (Section 9.4). Nevertheless, if a large inventory had not been present, the explosion could not have occurred.

Similar processes to those used at Flixborough are operated by many companies worldwide. Conversion rarely, if ever, exceeds 10%. We have become so accustomed to low conversions on this and other processes that we do not realize that it is fundamentally poor engineering to give 90%–95% of our material a “free ride.” What would we think of an airline on which only 5%–10% of the passengers got off at the end of each trip, the rest staying on board to enjoy the movies?

Other liquid-phase oxidation processes such as the oxidation of cumene to phenol are similar. Reaction is slow, conversion is low, and recycle is large (Section 4.2.4).

Beyond the hazard presented by large inventories, there is an additional hazard of oxidation plants: The vapor space above the liquid or the off gas can enter the explosive range. In the oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, a new catalyst makes it possible to operate farther from the explosive region. 28 Similarly, in cumene oxidation plants, the chance of a runaway reaction can be reduced by lowering the reaction temperature, though this increases the reaction volume. Intensification and attenuation are often alternatives.

If oxygen is used instead of air in an oxidation reactor, off-gassing is reduced, and the separation unit is smaller; on the other hand, explosive limits are wider, and steel can burn in an oxygen atmosphere.23 

3.2.5 Adipic Acid Production

The KA mixture produced in the process just described is oxidized to adipic acid with nitric acid as a further stage in the manufacture of nylon. For many years, the reaction took place in a reactor fitted with a stirrer, an external cooler, and a pump (Figure 3.9[a]). (This figure is much simplified. In practice, various combinations of series and parallel operation were tried for reactors and coolers.29 ) Ultimately, an internally cooled plug-flow reactor was designed and constructed (Figure 3.9[b]). It contains less material for a given output, and the pump, external cooler, connecting lines, and stirrer gland—all of them possible sources of leaks—were eliminated. Mixing is achieved by the gas given off the reactor.29 

Figure 3.9 Adipic acid reactors.

All the acid is added to the first compartment of the reactor, and the KA is added to each compartment via sparge pipes. The reduction in inventory results from the elimination of the external equipment and the prevention of back-mixing. Distillation can also be intensified by eliminating back-mixing (Section 3.3.2).

Over a period of 25 years, many improvements were made to the detailed design of the externally cooled reactors, but no change was made to the basic design. Nylon production was very profitable, and this discouraged innovation; it was more important to increase output than experiment with new designs that might have had unforeseen snags or taken longer to bring on line.

This does not explain why the original design used an external cooler. Perhaps it was used on the pilot plant and simply copied. Perhaps the reactor was designed by a reaction specialist and the cooler by a heat-transfer specialist, and the two engineers never got together.

A reactor similar to that shown in Figure 3.9(b) has been used for cyclohexane oxidation.30

3.2.6 Polyolefin Production

At one time, polypropylene was manufactured using a flammable hydrocarbon as solvent, but all new plants now use pure propylene. In some of them, the propylene is in the vapor phase and in others in the liquid phase, but there is little to choose so far as safety is concerned because the vapor-phase propylene is near its critical point and has a density not very different from that of the liquid.31 

The solvents used were, of course, no more flammable than the propylene, but the newer processes do not give a solvent a “free ride” and avoid the need for separation equipment.

Ethylene can now be polymerized to low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in the vapor phase at low pressure (Section 5.1.3). The older processes use gas at high pressures so that the ethylene has a density similar to that of the liquid.32,33  Examples of high-pressure ethylene polymerization to LDPE still exist; the tubular reactor is enclosed in a concrete bunker. This is an example of a passive barrier, not inherent safety.

3.2.7 Ethylene Oxide Derivatives

Ethylene oxide derivatives are usually manufactured in semibatch reactors. The other reactant is usually put into the reactor first, and the ethylene oxide is added gradually. The mixture is circulated by stirring or by circulation through a cooler. The ethylene oxide reacts quickly, and its concentration remains low. However, ethylene oxide is present in the vapor space and, if a source of ignition turns up, ethylene oxide can explode without the presence of air. In addition, if reaction is slow or fails to occur, for example, because the stirrer or circulation pump stops, the temperature is too low, or the catalyst is inactive, ethylene oxide can accumulate in the liquid. If reaction then starts, it can accelerate out of control. 34 The other reactant is often flammable and can burn or explode if there is a leak.

In an alternative process, reaction takes place in a tubular reactor. There is no vapor space, and leaks can be stopped by closing a valve. If desired, several valves, automatically operated, can be used to limit the size of any leak (Figure 3.3).

Section 8.3.1 describes another hazard of reactions involving ethylene oxide.

3.2.8 Devices for Improving Mixing

As already emphasized, many reactions are slow and need a large reaction volume because mixing is poor. Some methods of improving mixing have already been described: mixing in an injector (Section 3.2.3) and using a down-pumping impeller (Section 3.2.4). Another method is mixing in a pump (Section 5.1.2). Figure 7.13 shows a fluidic mixer, i.e., one without any moving parts in contact with the liquid. Figures 3.10 and 3.11 show some methods suggested by Middleton and Revill 13 for improved mixing of two liquids or a liquid and a gas.

Leigh and Preece 35 have described a system that combines reaction (or extraction) and separation in one unit (Figure 3.12). Turbulent jets of liquid are discharged into a second immiscible liquid, thus generating high velocities between the two phases. Inclined plates provide a large surface area for the heavier phase to coalesce and flow back to the reentrainment zone (the base of the vessel), while the lighter phase rises and is drawn off by the pump.

In addition to the inherent advantage of combining the extraction and reaction processes, the increased efficiency of the mass transfer process per unit volume results in a smaller inventory for a higher throughput. The device has a simple construction and no internal moving parts or sealing problems other than at the pump gland, and the pump that transfers the process liquid between the units also provides the agitation power. The device can easily be modified for continuous operation and the internal plates used, if necessary, for heat transfer.

Several authors 36,37 have shown how reaction and distillation can be combined.

Butcher 38 describes a research program for improving mixing in reactors. The important parameter is power input per unit mass, and the following figures are quoted:

Another method of improving mixing in a reactor is to mix the reactants thoroughly under conditions in which they cannot react and then start reaction by raising the temperature or pressure or adding a solvent or catalyst. When reaction occurs as soon as reactants are mixed, high local concentrations may produce unwanted side reactions (Section 3.2.4). If mixing is complete before reaction starts, higher conversions may be possible.

Other technologies can sometimes suggest solutions to our problems. In older beverage vending machines, the various constituents of the drinks (tea or coffee powder or concentrate, milk, sugar, etc.) are added through the same pipe. The equipment is complex, and contamination can result and cause the drink to taste of the previous drink. This problem is overcome through designs in which the constituents are already mixed in the cup, and all the machine has to do is select the right cup and add water.

After the explosion at Flixborough, another company that operated a similar process started a research program on alternative designs. A process using a tubular reactor employing the principle described earlier showed promise. The program was abandoned because there seemed little chance that a new plant would be needed in the foreseeable future. The researchers were disappointed, but commercially the decision was right. So far as I am aware (as of the late 1990s), no new plant has built in the West since Flixborough; all the new capacity has been focused in Eastern Europe or the Far East.

Another possible idea is to replace some of the raw material that will be recycled by an inert safe material that is easily separated. This is done in fluidized beds for the combustion of coal where only 1 particle in 200 needs to be a coal particle and the rest can be sand. 39 The use of chemically inert powders as a form of attenuation for dust explosion prevention is discussed in detail in Section 13.5.1.

Centrifugal mixers are explained in Section 3.3.3.

When a reaction is complete, the product has to be separated from unconverted raw material and unwanted by-products. Intensification of distillation is discussed in the next section, but the most effective way of intensifying separation is to increase conversion and specificity in the reaction section of the plant. What you don’t have to separate won’t leak while it is separated.

3.2.9 Other Processes

See Section 3.4 for a method of combining heat exchange and reaction.

Caro’s acid is a mixture of sulfuric acid, water, and peroxymonosulfuric acid (H2 SO5 ) made by reacting concentrated sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Its use as a powerful oxidizing agent has been impeded by the cost and difficulty of its manufacture, transport, and storage. It decomposes unless cooled within a second of manufacture. These problems have been overcome by the design of a well-mixed tubular reactor and immediate cooling of the product in the solution to be treated.40 

As commented earlier, it is far easier to introduce inherently safer design in new plants than in existing ones, though storage can often be reduced on the latter (Section 3.6). However, Gowland 41 has described the way in which Dow improved the inherent safety of an acquired plant that contained a unit for the manufacture of phosgene. Improving the reliability of the control equipment made it possible to reduce in-plant storage; buying purer carbon monoxide, one of the raw materials, made it possible to eliminate parts of the purification section (thus simplifying as well as intensifying); and changing the chlorine supply from liquid to gas reduced the chlorine inventory by 90%.

Carrithers et al. 42 have also described the ways in which an old plant was made more user friendly. One is described in Section 5.2.

An interesting example of intensification, though one that improves the environment rather than safety, is the deep-shaft process developed by ICI for the treatment of liquid industrial and domestic waste. A mixture of air and waste is passed through a buried U-tube about 100 m long. The high pressure at the bottom of the tube causes the air to dissolve, and the fermentation rate is high. The process requires only a fraction of the land needed by conventional treatment plants.39,43

3.2.10 Recent Developments in Reactor Technology

Chapter 5 in Reference 1 begins with the statement that, in the context of intensification, the reactor has received more attention than other unit operations. This is similar to the earlier remark in the current book that no unit operation, except storage, offers more scope for reduction of inventory than reaction. One need only examine the number of references at the end of this chapter to appreciate the veracity of both comments.

It is not the intention here to review the field of reactor intensification; this has been comprehensively done by Reay et al. 1 Rather, several examples from the recent process-development and process-safety literature are given to illustrate the breadth of this important field.

Benaissa et al. 44 describe a type of continuous heat exchanger-reactor (see also Section 3.4) known as an open plate reactor (OPR) and having the flow pattern shown in Figure 3.13. 44 The reaction system studied was the esterification of propionic anhydride by 2-butanol to yield butyl propionate and propionic acid. They used a combination of kinetic modeling and experimentation to determine temperature and concentration profiles during the synthesis reaction and to decide on optimal operating conditions that could be adequately controlled.

By changing from a batch to a continuous processing mode, this heat exchangerreactor design 44 leads to smaller inventories and therefore minimization of the consequences of a hazardous release. A hazard and operability (Hazop) study was also used to investigate accident scenarios leading to runaway reaction. The study revealed that in the case of simultaneous stoppage of both process and utility flows, the stainless steel sandwich and reaction plates helped to dissipate some of the energy released by the reaction (thereby offering additional thermal mass as an inherent characteristic of the apparatus).

A similar improvement in inherent safety can be accomplished by a switch from batch to continuous processing in a spinning disc reactor (SDR). 45 In this particular type of thin-film reactor, styrene was polymerized using centrifugal acceleration to create highly sheared films of thickness 100–200 μm on a rotating surface (see also Section 3.3.3). From the perspective of the simplification principle, there is additional complexity because of the introduction of moving parts. While this may on the one hand be viewed as a disadvantage, 1 Boodhoo and Jachuck 45 comment that the rotational speed can also be seen as an additional parameter for control of reaction rate and product quality.

The safety aspects of membrane reactors have recently been reviewed by Chiappetta et al., 46 who describe these devices as being capable of taking advantage of the synergistic effects of separation and reaction in a chemical process. In some applications, the membrane serves to provide a controlled feed of a given reactant, thus improving reagent distribution, maintaining a low concentration level, and avoiding side reactions.

Elgue, and M. Demissy, “Evaluation of an Intensified Continuous Heat-Exchanger Reactor for Inherently Safer Characteristics,” Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries 21, no. 5 (2008): 528–536.

This is the case for gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons, in which the gradual feeding of oxygen through a membrane avoids the formation of hot spots and limits the likelihood of reaction runaway. 47 In the porous-wall ceramic membrane reactor (PWCMR) described by Coronas et al., 47 oxygen is supplied as it is consumed, and thus the reactor can be operated outside the flammability range of the oxygen/ hydrocarbon mixture while maintaining a sufficiently high conversion. Attenuation of reaction conditions is therefore achieved in addition to intensification of hazardous inventories.

Another reactor classification discussed by Reay et al. 1 is the microreactor. Microreactor technology dates from the 1970s, 48 but only over the last decade have these devices made the transition from laboratory tools to production reactors in the chemical process industries. 49 Burns and Ramshaw 50 describe a benzene nitration reactor in which rapid mass transfer can be accomplished by stable parallel flow in capillaries of bore size between 127 and 254 μm. The integration of heat exchange with chemical reaction has also been achieved with a microstructure combination used for fuel processing.51 

Inherently safer operation of microreactors is, of course, brought about by reduction of the inventory of the reacting mixture. This advantage can manifest itself in different ways. For example, microreactors are generally characterized by a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, which if large enough can significantly increase the time to reaction runaway. 52 Additionally, the narrow diameter of flow channels facilitates use of the quenching-distance concept for determination of maximum safe capillary diameters in gas-phase oxidation reactors, as evidenced by the work of Fischer et al. 49 with stoichiometric ethane/oxygen mixtures.

### 3.3 Distillation

Much of the following applies also to other liquid–vapor contacting processes such as absorption and scrubbing.

3.3.1 Conventional Distillation

There is a large inventory of boiling liquid, often under pressure, in the base of a distillation column, and a larger quantity, often several times more, is held up in the column. In an atmospheric-pressure column, the liquid is just above its normal boiling point, but in a pressure column much of the liquid will flash if it is released (Section 2.3).

In choosing a packing or tray design, many factors have to be taken into account. Low inventory should be one of our objectives. There is a big variation between different trays and packings in the holdup per theoretical plate. 53 Most tray designs have a holdup between 40 and 100 mm per theoretical plate; for most packings it is 30–60 mm; for film trays it is less than 20 mm. Unfortunately, comparative information is not readily available to the designer.

Figure 3.14 shows some other ways of reducing inventory. The amount of material in the base can be reduced by narrowing the base so that the column appears to balance on the point of a needle (Figure 3.14[a]). This is done when the bottoms product degrades when kept hot, but it could be done more often. However, although column bases can be designed for low inventory, it may be hazardous to reduce the level in an existing column. If the top of the reboiler is uncovered, the vapor may be overheated. Indeed, this led to an explosion in an ethylene oxide still in Texas in 1992 (Section 6.2.4).54 

Internal calandrias and dephlegmators require a lower inventory than external reboilers and condensers; there is less equipment to leak; and there is no large overhead vapor line. Perhaps even the bottoms pump could go inside the column (Figure 3.14[b]). An alternative to a dephlegmator is an air cooler mounted on the top of the column. When possible, two distillation columns should be combined, as shown in Figure 3.14(c).

Besides the hazard due to the large inventory, a large column base can give rise to a more subtle hazard. In a still heated by live steam, calculations have shown that when reflux is lost, the rise in pressure should be sufficient to prevent steam from entering the column. This was taken into account in the design of the relief system. However, the designer overlooked the fact that the light ends from the top of the still will be dumped into a large quantity of hot bottoms, which will vaporize them and increase the pressure. The quantity of hot bottoms could be reduced by narrowing the base.

Low-inventory distillation equipment such as Luwa and other agitated thin-film evaporators 55,56 have been used for exceptionally hazardous materials such as cumene hydroperoxide, an intermediate in the manufacture of phenol and acetone from cumene, for it can decompose explosively. Perhaps such distillation equipment could be used more often.

Other methods of separation could be considered in place of distillation. Most chemical engineers accept distillation as the default choice and consider alternatives only when distillation is impracticable. Membrane separation or liquid–liquid extraction might be considered more often. The latter needs large inventories, but the liquids are usually at or near ambient temperatures.

3.3.2 Higee Distillation

The reductions in inventory obtainable by the methods just described are small compared with those attainable by the use of the Higee rotating equipment57–60  (Figure 3.15) invented by Ramshaw (at the time with ICI) and marketed by Glitsch of Dallas, Texas. This equipment can reduce residence times in the distillation equipment to about a second and can reduce inventories by a factor of 1000.

In the Higee process distillation takes place in a rotating packed bed at an acceleration of 10 4 m/s2 . The packing has a voidage of 90%–95% and a specific surface area of 2000–5000 m2 /m3 . It has the shape of a flat cylinder with a hole in the middle; the radius is typically about 1 m, and the height a little less. Vapor or gas is fed to the case of the machine, enters the packing through the cylindrical outer surface, and travels inward. Liquid is introduced through a stationary distributor in the center of the rotor, enters the inner surface of the packed bed, and moves outward.

The radius of the packed bed corresponds to the height of a normal column and determines the number of theoretical plates, and the height of the packed bed corresponds to the diameter of a normal column and determines the capacity. Because it would be difficult to add liquid partway through the packing, two units are needed: one for the stripping section and one for the fractionation section.

The Higee unit is very compact, and photographs show it arriving on-site on the back of a truck (Figure 3.16). However, the condenser and reboiler are not part of the unit and must be supplied separately.

Figure 3.15 The ICI Higee distillation unit. (From C. Ramshaw, “Higee Distillation: An Example of Process Intensification,” Chem. Eng. [U.K.] 389 [1983]: 13–14.)

The Sherwood flooding correlation (Figure 3.17) for a packed bed shows that, for a given packing, an increase in g allows the gas and liquid flows to be increased. Alternatively, the packing size can be reduced and the area increased.

However, this description does not give us a picture of what is happening. To get such a picture, think of the increased “gravity” as reducing back-mixing, which, in a normal packed column, prevents the achievement of the degree of separation that is theoretically possible. (Section 3.2.5 showed how a decrease in back-mixing in a reactor produced a decrease in reactor volume.)

Although the chemical engineering of the Higee unit is novel, the mechanical engineering is conventional. The speed of rotation is similar to that of a centrifuge.

Though the Higee is a brilliant invention that has been shown to work satisfactorily on the full scale, very few were in use in the late 1980s, 58 even in the company where it was invented, and most of the applications have been for stripping liquids with gases or for treating gases with liquids, 58,59,61,62 not for distillation. A recent industry report 63 states that there are only about 30 units in operation worldwide, with many of these being experimental columns at various universities (e.g., Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India, 64 and University of Campinas, Brazil65 ).

Why has the uptake by industry of Higee technology been slow?

Higee technology can reduce the capital cost of distillation equipment, but the saving, compared with the total capital cost of a project, is small. Project engineers and business managers, including those at ICI, where Higee was invented, are reluctant to invest in new technology for a small percentage saving in cost in case there are unforeseen difficulties that prevent or delay the achievement of design output. According to Ramshaw, 66 “The main problem to be overcome is the dubious perception, by most plant operators, of the reliability of rotating machines.… We must convince skeptics that hazardous process fluids can be retained in the equipment.” These same thoughts have been echoed by Green et al. 67 In addition, since Higee first became available in

late 1982, there have been periods of recession when few new plants were built.

Nevertheless, the major oil and chemical companies spend large sums every year on distillation equipment. The possible advantages to them, in cost savings and increased safety, are large. It is surprising that companies have not invested in one or two Higee units each, just to gain experience with them, with any unexpected costs or delays underwritten by the company as a whole rather than by specific projects or businesses. Unfortunately, one of the results of the movement toward business-centered rather than functional organization is that there may be no central organization that can fund (or even recommend) such an investment. This is a good example of the effects of organization on technology (Section 10.1.5).

A recent review of equipment improvements in distillation technology supports these comments on the motivation for change within industry. Olujic et al. 68 give the main reason for implementation of innovations in distillation technology as the demand to stay competitive by minimizing capital expenditures and operating costs while increasing production capacity. Activities often therefore focus on improving the performance characteristics of vapor–liquid contactors such as trays and packings. Higee and other process-intensification alternatives to large-column distillation do not figure prominently in their review of the distillation field.68 

The advantages of Higee are, however, so great that ultimately it will surely succeed. (However, worthwhile inventions are not always exploited. In pre-Columbian Central America, wheels were known but used only as toys.) The large distillation columns that we think of as advanced technology are, perhaps more than any other equipment, the chemical engineering equivalents of the beam engines referred to in Section 2.4. In the short term, Higee seems most likely to be employed when expensive materials of construction have to be used (so that the savings are greater than usual), when space is scarce (as on offshore oil platforms, but see Section 10.7), when there are height limitations, and for other gas–liquid-contacting applications.

Higee technology is being developed at the “Higrav” research center at the University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China. Processes developed or being developed include deaeration of water, absorption of sulfur dioxide from flue gas, HOCl production, and preparation of nanoparticles. Zhao et al. 69 indicate that long-time running of rotating packed beds using Higee to gain commercial data and experience will be key to market acceptance of the technology.

The use of Higee in a nanotechnology application 69 is interesting, in that inherently safer designs have been cited as a key factor in eliminating or reducing hazards associated with emerging technologies such as nanotechnology. 70 Potential concerns with nanoparticles are fires and explosions should large quantities of combustible powder be generated during reactions or production; 71,72 intensification through inventory reduction is again seen to be advantageous. Binding nanoparticles to a substrate (a form of attenuation or moderation) can help reduce the toxicity of some materials.72 

The British company AEA Technology developed a fluidic gas–liquid contactor somewhat similar to Higee, but the gas moves rather than the packing. The gas enters at the side, as in Figure 3.15, but tangentially through a series of vanes around the rim, and leaves from the center. The liquid is sprayed into the center. The intensification factor is much lower than for Higee, but there are no moving parts. There is also no packing to foul. Like Higee, the contactor has been used mainly for gas–liquid-contact processes other than distillation.73 

The term fluidics is used to describe equipment, such as mixers, pumps, and valves, that is driven by liquid pressure and contains no moving parts. Widely used by the nuclear industry, this equipment is robust and reliable. Such mixers, pumps, and valves are often intensified, compared with conventional alternatives, and are also friendlier in another way: They contain no moving parts that can malfunction and start to leak (Section 7.9).

3.3.3 Other Applications of Centrifugation

This is a convenient place to mention other operations in which intensification can be achieved by rotation, often using lower speeds than Higee. Interphase mass transfer and phase separation can be improved by an increase in the relative velocity of the phases. The applications, most using rotating plates or packed beds, have been reviewed by Ramshaw 66,74 and include the following:

1. Scrubbing benzene and other impurities from coke-oven gas.

2. Using liquid–liquid extraction.75 

3. Demisting gases, in particular by using a rotating mop irrigated with liquid.76 

Such a device has been used successfully to remove lime dust from air. It acts as a fan to move the gas as well as a scrubber and is thus a good example of intensification achieved by combining two operations in one item of equipment.

4. Deaerating seawater.77 

5. Mixing.78,79 

6. Convection drying of solid particles.80,81 

7. Improving gas disengagement at electrodes.74 

8. Using absorption heat pumps.82 

9. Polymerizing on a spinning disc.45,83,84 

10. Intensifying heat transfer (Section 3.4).

Slow rotation has been used to improve the wetting in thin-film evaporators.85  Keyvani and Gardner 86 have reviewed gas–liquid contacting in rotating beds.

### 3.4 Heat Transfer

If Higee (Section 3.3.2) is used instead of conventional distillation, then the inventory in the reboiler and condenser is far greater than the inventory in the distillation unit. The team that developed Higee therefore turned their attention to ways of intensifying heat transfer. One suggestion made was to place the reboiler on the periphery of the Higee unit because centrifugal fields improve heat transfer when a phase change is involved.87 

Another idea from the same team for heat transfer when there is no phase change has been developed to the stage that the equipment is now available commercially. It uses parallel plate exchangers with very narrow spaces (fractions of a millimeter) between the plates. To manufacture the exchangers, fluid-flow passages are etched into metal plates by techniques similar to those used to produce printed circuits. The plates are then diffusion-bonded together to form blocks. Fouling does not seem to be a problem if intermittent reverse flow can be used.87,88 

Table 3.1 summarizes the surface compactness—the ratio of heat-transfer area to fluid volume—of various types of heat exchangers. Note that the inventory of hazardous material in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger can be reduced by putting the more hazardous material in the tubes. (Water-tube boilers contain much less water under pressure than old-fashioned boilers with the water in the shell, and their failure is correspondingly less hazardous.) In all exchangers, the inventory can be reduced by higher flow rates, extended surfaces, and higher temperature differences. A compromise of inventory, efficiency, and pressure drop may be necessary.

Most plate exchangers have a high surface compactness that fins can increase further. At one time, the difficulty of finding suitable gaskets restricted the use of plate exchangers, but these difficulties now seem to have been overcome.93,94  Gasket-free all-welded designs are now available (though only for use at pressures up to 100 bar). 95 Weld-free (diffusion-bonded) titanium plate exchangers are now made using technology developed for jet engine blades.96 

Jachuk and Ramshaw 97 have suggested the use of corrugated high-performance plastic films in heat exchangers. Polyether ether ketones and polyimides could be used up to 250°C.

In both plate and shell and tube exchangers, heat transfer can be enhanced by increasing turbulence and thus reducing fouling. 98 The U.K. Energy Efficiency Office has described several applications of intensified heat exchangers.99 

Figure 3.18 illustrates a fixed-bed regenerative heat exchanger. The hot and cold streams flow alternately through two beds of matrix, which store the heat. 100 Heat transfer in shell-and-tube exchangers can be improved, and the inventory reduced, by inserting a matrix of wire into the tubes. The wire promotes turbulence, particularly near the walls. 101,102 If the increased pressure drop can be tolerated, this is one of the few ways in which existing equipment can be intensified. Turbulence is also higher in twisted-tube heat exchangers. 103 Oscillating flow increases heat transfer and thus reduces inventory.104 

Unfortunately, information on the compactness of commercially available heat exchangers is not readily available to the designer because manufacturers do not, as a rule, include this information in their catalogs.

Aqueous liquids can be heated by direct injection of steam, thus simplifying the plant and saving the cost of an exchanger. For examples, see Sections 4.1.3 and 6.2.4. Collapse of steam bubbles can cause excessive vibration, but this can be overcome by mixing steam and water before injection into the bulk liquid.105 

Ramshaw has suggested combining heat exchangers and reactors by coating the surfaces of a compact heat exchanger with catalyst. 106 An example is the production of hydrogen by the combustion and subsequent steam re-forming of methane. The combustion is exothermic and is carried out on one side of the heat exchanger while the endothermic re-forming reaction takes place on the other side. A thousandfold reduction in size is possible.107 

### 3.5 Other Unit Operations

Liquid–vapor-contacting processes such as gas scrubbing and liquid stripping have been discussed under distillation (Section 3.3), and many of the devices described under reaction (Section 3.2) can be used in other liquid–liquid- and liquid–gas-contacting processes. The volume of liquid in liquid–liquid separators can be reduced by devices designed to promote coalescence of the dispersed phase, such as extended surfaces or packings 108 or electrostatic coalescers. 109 For example, a study of coalescers for the removal of water from aviation jet fuel brought about a “significant” reduction in equipment size. 108 Section 3.2.6 describes a device that achieves reaction and settling in a single unit.

Ramshaw has discussed intensification of crystallization 110 and drying, 111 and Gillett 112 has discussed the drying of pharmaceuticals. According to Williams,113  vortex mixing can intensify membrane separation.

It thus seems that every unit operation can be intensified if we look for ways of achieving that objective; the recent text by Reay et al. 1 provides more examples. Common features, according to Ramshaw, are increased acceleration and laminar flow and shorter mixing paths. In 1980, Merck Sharp & Dohme’s biochemical engineering consultants were asked if it was worth trying to improve fermentation performance through improved mixing. The answer was no. “You will perhaps not be surprised that over the last couple of years Merck has reported significantly improved performance through enhanced mixing. Merck was able to do this because the company had a pilot plant with the quality of instrumentation and control that allowed a realistic assessment of what the changes in agitation were achieving.”114 

In a fascinating paper published in 1993, Benson and Ponton 115 point out that, although electronic equipment had become smaller and cheaper during the past 50 years, chemical plants looked and cost much the same as they did 50 years before. They speculate on some of the ways in which the chemical industry could follow the trend toward miniaturization and at the same time reduce the need for storage and transportation by manufacture at the point of use. They give three examples that remain relevant today:

1. Manufacturers who buy small amounts of chlorine in cylinders could instead manufacture it on-site in small packaged units by the electrolysis of brine. The by-product hydrogen could be used to generate electricity in a fuel cell. In situ ozone production is suggested for water supplies and swimming pools.

2. Methanol for use in place of gasoline could be made at home in small packaged units from natural gas by re-forming it to carbon monoxide and hydrogen and then combining the products. The excess hydrogen could be burned to provide heat for the re-forming step and domestic hot water.

3. Manufacturers who need hydrogen cyanide could make it on-site from ammonia and natural gas in a small turbine that could also produce electricity. Packaged units for manufacturing phosgene at the point of use are already available 116 (Section 3.6).

Rinard says that chemical plants today are like the mainframe computers of the 1950s and 1960s: large, expensive, awkward, centralized facilities runs by staffs of experts. Miniaturized plants, like personal computers, are intended for distributed use by nonexperts.117 

If this seems impossible, remember that most of us, though unskilled in plant operation, regularly operate plants in which controlled explosions are carried out thousands of times every minute. Though accidents are frequent, they are not caused by chemistry getting out of control. The operators often find it difficult to control the mechanics, not the process.

In an entirely different field, pesticides can be spread more safely and economically by using more powerful and effective agents and more effective methods of dispersion.118 

Some of the methods of simplifying designs described in Sections 7.8 and 7.10 also produce a reduction in inventory.

### 3.6 Storage

The worst disaster in the history of the chemical industry occurred in Bhopal, India, in 1984 when a leak of methyl isocyanate (MIC) from a storage tank killed over 2000 people and injured many more. There are many lessons to be learned from Bhopal 119 (Section 4.2.1), but the most important, ignored by many commentators, is that the material that leaked was not a raw material or product but an intermediate that it was convenient, but not essential, to store. After Bhopal, Union Carbide, the company concerned, and many other companies announced that MIC and other hazardous intermediates would not be stored but would be used as soon as they were produced. Instead of 50 or 100 tonnes in a tank, there would be only a few kilograms in a pipeline.120,121 

In 1994, 10 years after Bhopal, one U.S. company still stored up to 120 tons of methyl isocyanate, probably one of the last companies in the world to store such large quantities of the material. A report sponsored by concerned citizens suggested ways of reducing the amount stored. Producing it more uniformly throughout the year and storing more of the final products could reduce the maximum inventory, they said, to about 70 tons. Converting all four processes that use methyl isocyanate to direct feed could reduce it, in stages, to 5–50 kg in the pipelines feeding the four units. In the long term, a change to other process routes could eliminate it entirely. The report admitted that much money had been spent since 1984 on upgrading the plant and installing safety features, but “a lesson of Bhopal is that safety features are prone to failure.”122 

The chemical industry has reduced or eliminated stocks of other intermediates such as phosgene 116,123 (Section 4.2.3), hydrogen cyanide, 116 ethylene and propylene oxides, 124 sulfur trioxide, and chlorine.

Ciba–Geigy developed skin-mounted units for the production of 15 tonnes/ day of phosgene; they could produce as little as 1.5 tonnes/day if required. Imperial Chemical Industries stopped supplying phosgene in 1989, preferring its customers to produce this intermediate on-site as required.116

DuPont developed a process for the distributed production of small amounts of hydrogen cyanide. Two reactions were studied: the reaction of ammonia with solid carbon and the reaction of ammonia with methane over a catalyst. Both reactions are endothermic, and heat is supplied by microwave heating. The reactions can be stopped quickly by turning off the heating and cooling with inert gas.125 

Small amounts of storage may be necessary in some cases so that intermediates can be analyzed, and in other cases diversion tanks for off-specification intermediates may be necessary. The need for such storage should be questioned. Do not ask whether it is essential to have such storage. It is too easy to say yes. Ask, “If I had to manage without it, how would I do so?” (See Section 10.2.3.)

One company, located in a built-up area, moved its ethylene oxide storage and consuming plant to another site. 121 Another company reduced its chlorine storage from several thousand tonnes to several hundred tonnes. Another plant eliminated chlorine storage entirely and, with it, the associated liquefaction and vaporization equipment. The reduction was made possible by changes in the chlorine manufacturing process that make it possible to increase and decrease rate much more rapidly than in the past when demand changes.

One plant had seven spheres for the storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). These were necessary, the managers said, to cover interruptions in production. When new legislation required the spheres to be mounded or insulated, the staff found that it could manage with three. This is not unlike the conclusion reached by Leal and Santiago,126  who determined that, for their study conditions, it was better to keep a smaller number of fully-filled spheres than many spheres only partially filled with LPG.

Note that intermediates are usually reactive chemicals and therefore likely to be hazardous, or they would not be used as intermediates.

Computer simulations based on variations in demand and the known pattern of shutdowns, planned and unplanned, in the producing units are often used to show that so much raw material, intermediate, or product storage is necessary. However, these simulations take no account of the fact that, if stocks are low, people improvise, change plans, carry out maintenance more urgently, and so on in order to maintain production in a way not foreseen at the design stage. “Grey hairs cost the company nothing.” Holusha, 127 reviewing a book on Japanese industry, writes that

the American practice of having buffer stocks of partly finished components all along the production line concealed problems. If a machine broke down, parts from a nearby buffer stock could keep the assembly line working until somebody got round to fixing the machine. But … if the security of the buffers was removed, if the whole plant were in jeopardy of being shut down by one malfunctioning machine, the workers would be forced to tend their machines more carefully, so that all worked correctly all the time. The discipline this system imposed brought surprising improvements in productivity and quality.

In short, the need for large stocks is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the process industries, reduced stocks will not make operators treat their plants more carefully, but the reductions will encourage the maintenance organization to get the plant back on-line quickly after a shutdown.

Another example: After visiting a Porsche plant, a Toyota engineer said that workers were swamped by the piles of parts stacked in racks above the shop floor. “Where’s the factory?” he asked. “This is a warehouse.” A week later, the parts inventory in the engine room was reduced from a 28- to a 7-day supply.128 

Note also that it may be possible to reduce storage requirements by making the plant 5% or 10% larger than required, the extra capacity being used to cover delays in the arrival of raw material, upsets in one part of the plant, delays in dispatch of product, and so on. It may be cheaper as well as safer to do this rather than supply the storage.

The need for intermediate storage (and transport) can often be reduced or eliminated by constructing storage and using plants on the same site. At one time, cyanogen chloride was manufactured on one site and transported several hundred miles in cylinders. A hundred journeys were made per year. Now it is manufactured near the point of use, and the inventory has been reduced from 20 tonnes under pressure to a few kilograms at atmospheric pressure.

The need to transport chlorine (or hypochlorite) to swimming pools and store it there can be avoided by generating it at the point of use by electrolysis of brine.

Production at the point of use also avoids the hazards of transport, usually by road. The probability that someone will be killed by an ordinary road accident involving a tank truck is much greater than the probability that he or she will be killed by the contents. 129 The risks associated with transportation of hazardous materials are the subject of intensive research worldwide (e.g., Bubbico et al.130,131 ).

Material in storage is less likely to be involved in a serious leak or fire than material in a plant because it is not being heated, cooled, pumped, or processed in other ways. On the other hand, when storage is involved in a major incident, the financial losses are higher. The largest losses in the period 1955–1984 occurred wholly or mainly in 24 of the 100 storage areas. 132 For the period 1965–1994, the figure was 19. 133 The final investigation report 134 of the Buncefield incident that occurred on December 11, 2005, in Hertfordshire, U.K., gives a figure of 1 billion £ for the economic impact (comprising compensation for loss, costs of emergency response and investigations, and costs to the aviation sector). The report comments that, although this may seem a rather large sum compared to other major incidents, it is not unique.134 

In the European Union, the reduction in stocks of hazardous chemicals has been stimulated by the so-called Seveso Directive 135 (enacted following the accident at Seveso in Italy in 1976; 136 see Section 6.2.4), which requires all companies that handle more than defined quantities of hazardous chemicals to demonstrate that they are capable of handling them safely. In the United Kingdom, the directive was implemented by the CIMAH (Control of Industrial Major Accident Hazard) Regulations, 137,138 which owe their origin to Flixborough and would still have been enacted, though in a slightly different form if Seveso had never occurred. CIMAH has now been replaced by COMAH (Control of Major Accident Hazards) in the United Kingdom, commensurate with the Seveso II Directive.

In the United States, the Process Safety Management Regulations have had a similar effect (Section 10.3). New regulations in Canada under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, Section 200, have legislated the requirement for an emergency response plan at facilities storing or using any of a number of listed substances at or above specified threshold quantities. 139 The concept of inventory reduction has therefore been introduced, albeit through an environmental regulatory route.

If time-consuming procedures and consultations with the authorities have to be followed when the stock of, say, chlorine, in storage exceeds a threshold quantity (in the U.K. case, 75 tonnes), companies find that they can manage with far less. The Seveso Directive and CIMAH/COMAII Regulations apply, of course, to hazardous materials in process as well as storage, but reduction of the inventory in process is difficult without a major rebuild, whereas reduction of stocks in storage is comparatively easy. (For chlorine in process, the threshold is 25 tonnes.)

Within companies, the finance director can be an ally of the process-safety adviser, for reduction in stocks saves capital. Design engineers know the cost of a storage tank but often do not know how much money they are tying up in the contents; it can exceed the cost of the tank.

### 3.7 Intensification by Detailed Design

Most of the methods of intensification discussed so far have involved major changes in equipment design or reductions in storage capacity. The following example shows that substantial reductions in capacity can be made by the application of wellknown principles without the need for any new technology.

Figure 3.19(a) shows part of the first design of a distillation unit for separating liquefied petroleum gases (LPG). There were actually two more similar distillation columns in the plant. Figure 3.19(b) shows a revised design in which the inventory was reduced, to the extent shown in Table 3.2, by making the following changes:

1. The reflux drum was left out, with the reflux pump taking suction from the liquid level in the condenser. The design of the condenser was reversed so that the LPG was on the shell side and the refrigerant in the tubes.

2. Buffer storage for the raw materials and products was left out, with flows going directly to the main off-plot storage areas from small surge drums.

3. A low hold-up packing was used in the column, and the holdup in the base was reduced to a 2-min residence time by narrowing the base.

### 3.8 Many Small Plants or One Big One?

Suppose we can choose between one large single-stream plant or two plants of the same or similar design, each half the size. The single large plant will usually be inherently safer because

1. It will contain a lower inventory than the two small plants combined (though there will be more of it in one place).

2. The two plants will contain more valves, flanges, pumps, sample points, pipes, and other sources of leak, and thus leaks will in total be twice as numerous.

3. The leaks will not be much smaller. Whereas the single plant contains a 4-in.

pipeline, the smaller plants will contain 3-in. lines. A flange leak from a 3-in. line will not be much smaller than one from a 4-in. line.

4. The single-stream plant will usually be much cheaper than the two half-size plants. Some of the money saved will be available for extrinsic safety measures that might be considered too expensive if they had to be duplicated. If we have to put all our eggs in one basket, one basket is cheaper than two, and we can afford a good, strong one.

However, we may be able to break these scaling laws by adopting different design approaches for the smaller plants, as already described in Section 3.5. Smaller plants, for example, have a larger surface area and may require less additional cooling capacity. It may be possible to construct them, in whole or in part, off-site. They are usually more flexible. Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI, writes the following:140 

Among the entrenched beliefs with which I grew up as a businessman, one of the most sacred cows was that the advantages would always go to the largest organization, because the larger the scale and size of the plant, the lower would be the cost of production. The difficulty with this belief was that we built larger and larger plants, which were in fact less and less flexible and required us to hold larger and larger stocks.… Now most of us are looking for flexibility: production lines which can produce many different models at the same time; machining centres which can machine any item or product, parallel production systems which gain in speed and time though apparently sub-optimising in cost, are all developments which lie totally against the beliefs of yesterday.… The effects of these changes in the needs of manufacturing are very far-reaching. In the first place, the cost of variety is sharply reduced, enabling competition to develop in unexpected ways.

In the process industries, there is an increasing demand for small amounts of short-lived products, frequent changes in formulation, and faster response times. Large-scale continuous plants are unsuited to these requirements. 141 But the answer is not batch plants; small-scale continuous plants are possible (Section 3.2).

The ICI-intensified “Leading Concept” ammonia process is said to be as economic to build and run at the 500-tonnes/year scale as on the 1000- or 1500-tonnes/ year scale.142

If a single large plant is multistream, it will be no safer than several smaller plants. Indeed, it may be less safe if large numbers of cross-connections are installed between the streams (Section 8.2).

When intensification results in less work—less material to be moved or handledthen there will be fewer accidents. A Bushman requires 525 acres (1300 hectares) to produce his food requirements. A British farmworker produces 50 times his requirements in 4 acres (10 hectares), giving an intensification factor of 6500 to 1. With less work, there will be fewer accidents. 143 The advocates of low-intensity organic farming do not seem to have considered the effects on agricultural accidents.

### 3.9 Some Thoughts on Intensification as Minimization

We most often think of intensification acting to reduce inventories of hazardous materials; this has been the primary theme of Chapter 3. It can also be helpful to consider aspects of intensification brought about by use of the concept of minimization.

As described by Goetsch, 144 there are various risk-reduction strategies for dealing with violence in the workplace. Access control, reporting policies, training, and monitoring devices are all commonly employed. An effective measure often overlooked is natural surveillance, which involves designing, arranging, and operating the workplace in a way that minimizes secluded areas. 144 Here, again, is a helpful reminder of the need for early consideration of inherent-safety principles in the design life cycle.

A newspaper article 145 reported on problems associated with biomedical wastes ending up in a local landfill. To protect workers at the site, three safety measures were introduced. Least effective in terms of the hierarchy of controls (Figure 1.1) was training the workers to pick up and sort only what they could actually see. Moving up the hierarchy to an add-on feature, personnel were immunized against hepatitis B and were also given tetanus shots. Most effective was the approach of identifying the source of the waste and taking steps to ensure that proper disposal was undertaken. This is clearly an attempt to minimize the hazard rather than accepting it and adding on control measures. All levels of the hierarchy are needed in this case, but there should be no doubt as to the order of precedence.

### Appendix: Conference Report—New Technology

Chapter 3 has discussed the difficulties inventors experience in getting their ideas accepted. It also mentioned that in pre-Columbian Central America, wheels were known but were used only as toys. In the following we assume that wheels have just been invented and were described at a conference. What follows is an extract from the discussion. All the arguments have been used before.

There was much interest at a recent conference on new technology in the description by International Chemicals, Inc. (ICI), of the WHEEL, a new device WHich spEEds traveL. Because there would be no advantage in putting chemical plants on WHEELs, ICI intends to fit them to fire engines so that the engines can get to the scenes of fires more quickly than current technology allows.

Although there was praise for the company’s ingenuity, most speakers expressed reservations. Joe Brown, speaking for the construction industry, thought caution was needed. The value of the WHEEL could not be fully assessed, he said, until several years’ experience had been obtained. There might be unforeseen snags that would not become apparent until the device had been in use for some time. He drew attention to the unforeseen effects of other changes, such as the temporary bellows at Flixborough.

Thomas Dowting, of the Chemical Industries Federation, regretted that the device had been made public before the views of other companies had been obtained. The government might expect other factories to adopt the WHEEL. Although it might be useful on large sites (although this was not yet proven), it was not appropriate to the needs of smaller factories in which fire engines did not have to travel so far.

Dr. Werner Hackenschmidt (Gesellschaft für Unsinnfabrikat) asked how WHEELs would be fabricated. The production of continuous rotating loadbearing devices presented difficult metallurgical problems. What materials would be used? Little was known about the behavior of metals when subjected to such unusual forces.

Professor Patrick Murphy, a member of the faculty of the University of Ballybunion, asked if maintenance had been considered. How could a WHEEL be removed for repair without the vehicle tipping over?

Fred Bloggs, speaking for the fire departments, felt that fire appliances should not be used as subjects for experimentation. Had firefighters been consulted? He was sure their view would be that safety equipment should stick to well-proven designs. If smoother travel was needed, why not dig canals between the fire station and the plants?

Dr. Angus McGregor, from Crianlarich Polytechnic, said that, because WHEELs could operate only on smooth surfaces, he could not see how they would be economic when the cost of road improvements was taken into account.

Bill Muddle (consultant) said that it was a mistake to assume that speedier travel to the scene of a fire is always desirable. Using present methods of travel, firefighters had time during the journey to formulate their plan of attack. There would be no gain if firefighters rushed in unprepared.

Myfanwy Price, of University College, Blanau Ffestiniog, said that the idea was not new. A similar device was in use at the Annisgrifiudwy-Cymysglyd factory when she worked there over 30 years ago, but it had fallen into disuse because no one had been able to devise a satisfactory way of stopping the vehicles. Hexagonal WHEELS had been found to assist braking but were disadvantageous in other respects; the ride was no longer smooth.

In summing up, the chairman said that the trials will be watched with interest; in the meantime, other organizations seem to prefer waiting.
