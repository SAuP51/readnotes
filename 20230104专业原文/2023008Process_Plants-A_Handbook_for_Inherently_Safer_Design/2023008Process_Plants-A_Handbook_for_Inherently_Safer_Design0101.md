## 0101. Introduction: What Are Inherently Safer and User-Friendly Plants?

We can pull and haul and push and drive, 

We can print and plough and weave and heat and light, 

We can run and race and swim and fly and drive, 

We can see and hear and count and read and write.…

But remember please, the law by which we live, 

We are not built to comprehend a lie, 

We can neither love nor pity nor forgive

If you make a slip in handling us, you die.

— Rudyard Kipling, “The Secret of the Machines”

### 1.1 Introduction

The aim of this book is to show that the last line in the poem above need not always be true and that we can often design plants that can tolerate human error and equipment failure without serious effects on safety, output, and efficiency.

The chemical industry expanded rapidly during the 1960s, and two unforeseen results were a series of major fires and explosions, culminating in those at Flixborough, United Kingdom, and Seveso, Italy, and a consequent demand for higher standards of safety. In response, the industry installed more and more safety equipment, and costs rose. People began to ask, “Where will it end?” “How much safety equipment should we add to our plants?” One answer was quantitative risk assessment: setting a target level of risk and not going beyond it (see Chapter 15). This approach has become widely accepted; it is an approach I use and advocate.1  Nevertheless, it should be our second-best choice. Before we estimate the probability and consequences of a hazard and compare them with a target, we should ask whether the hazard can be eliminated.

In all industries, equipment failures and errors by operators and maintenance workers are recognized as major causes of accidents, and much thought has been given to ways of reducing them or minimizing their consequences. 2 However, it is difficult for operators and maintenance workers to keep up an error-free performance all day, every day. We may keep up a tip-top performance for an hour or so while playing a game or a piece of music, but we cannot keep it up continuously. Designers have a second chance, opportunities to go over their designs again, but operators and maintenance workers do not get second chances. Plants should therefore be designed, whenever possible, so that they are user-friendly, to borrow a computer term, and can tolerate departures from ideal performance by operators or maintenance workers without serious effects on safety, output, or efficiency.

Similarly, although much attention has been paid to the improvement of equipment reliability, 100% reliability is unattainable, and compromises have to be made between reliability and cost. Plants should therefore be designed, whenever possible, so that equipment failure does not seriously affect safety, output, and efficiency.

These arguments apply to all industry but particularly to the chemical and nuclear industries, where hazardous materials are handled and the consequences of failure—by people or equipment—are serious. The levels of reliability required are high and may be beyond the capabilities of people or materials. For example, a joint leaked after a shutdown in which 2000 joints were broken and remade. Only one was remade incorrectly, but it was the only one that anyone heard about. Afterward, the fiber gaskets in most of the 5000 joints in the unit—all those exposed to liquid—were replaced by friendlier spiral-wound gaskets.

A hazard is a situation that can lead to harm. A risk is the probability that the harm will occur. Traditional plant designs try to reduce the risk by adding protective equipment and following safe methods of working. Inherently safer and friendlier plants remove or reduce the hazards. Following traditional methods, we become more and more efficient at things we should not be doing, except as a last resort.

The ways by which friendliness in plant design can be achieved are summarized below and discussed in detail in later chapters. The characteristics are not sharply defined and merge into each other.

1 Intensification or minimization. Friendly plants contain low inventories of hazardous materials—so little that it does not matter if the entire inventory leaks out. What you don’t have, can’t leak. This may seem obvious, but until the explosion at Flixborough in 1974, little thought was given to ways of reducing the amount of hazardous material in a plant. Engineers simply designed a plant and accepted whatever inventory the design required, confident that they could keep it under control. At Bhopal, India, in 1984, the material that leaked, killing over 2000 people, was an intermediate that was convenient, but not essential, to store. Inventories can often be reduced in almost all unit operations as well as during storage (see Chapter 3).

2 Substitution. If intensification is not possible, then an alternative is substitution: using a safer material in place of a hazardous one. Thus, it may be possible to replace flammable refrigerants and heat-transfer media by nonflammable ones, hazardous products by safer ones, and processes that use hazardous raw materials or intermediates by processes that do not (see Chapter 4).

Intensification, when it is practicable, is better than substitution because it brings about greater reductions in cost. If less material is present, we need smaller pipes and vessels as well as smaller structures and foundations. Much of the pressure for intensification has come from those who are primarily concerned with cost reduction. In fact, friendliness in plant design is not only an isolated concept but a desirable one in a total package of measures, including cost reduction, lower energy usage, and simplification that the chemical industry needs to continue to adopt in the years ahead (Section 2.4).

3 Attenuation or moderation. Another alternative to intensification is attenuation by using a hazardous material under the least hazardous conditions. Thus, liquefied chlorine and ammonia can be stored as refrigerated liquids at atmospheric pressure instead of storage under pressure at ambient temperature. Dyestuffs that form explosive dusts can be handled as slurries (see Chapter 5).

Attenuation (moderation) is sometimes the reverse of intensification (minimization), for if we make reaction conditions less extreme, we may need a longer residence time and a larger inventory. In designing friendly plants, we may have to compromise by considering different possibilities (see the quotation by David Pye at the front of the book).

4 Limitation of effects (a form of moderation) by changing designs or reaction conditions rather than by adding protective equipment that may fail or be neglected. If friendly equipment does leak, it does so at a low rate, which is easy to stop or control. Spiral-wound gaskets, as already mentioned, are friendlier than fiber gaskets because, if the bolts work loose or are not tightened correctly, the leak rate is lower. A tubular reactor is friendlier than a pot (batch) reactor because the leak rate is limited by the cross section of the pipe and can be stopped by closing a valve in the pipe. Vapor-phase reactors are friendlier than liquid-phase reactors, for the mass flow rate through a hole of a given size is less.

By changing reaction conditions (e.g., the temperature or the order of operations), it is often possible to prevent runaways or make them less likely. By carrying out different stages of a batch process in different vessels, it may be possible to tailor the equipment more closely to the needs of each step. By using steam or oil as a heating medium, and limiting its temperature, it may be possible to prevent overheating (see Chapter 6).

Intensification, substitution, attenuation, and limitation of effects produce inherently safer design because they avoid hazards instead of controlling them by adding protective equipment. The term inherently safer implies that the process is safer because of its very nature and not because equipment has been added to make it safer. Note that we talk of inherently safer plants, not inherently safe ones, for we cannot remove all hazards. Note also that some writers use the term inherently safer design in a wider sense to include all the methods of making plants friendlier that I discuss in this book. Some go even further and expand the concept of inherently safer designs to include methods of locating or confining equipment so that the effects of fires and explosions are minimized. I regard such protective measures as add-ons. The inherently safer solutions use nonflammable materials or so little flammable material that a leak would hardly matter or, if that is impossible, to use the hazardous material in the least hazardous form. If we make the definition of any concept too broad, designers will say they are using it when they are barely doing so.

To use an analogy, How deep does the water have to be before we can say we are bathing? Walking in water up to our ankles may be better than nothing, but hardly allows us to claim we are bathing.

5 Simplicity. Simpler plants are friendlier than complex plants because they provide fewer opportunities for error and less equipment that can fail. They are usually also cheaper.

The main reason for complexity in plant design is the need to add equipment to control hazards. Inherently safer plants are therefore also simpler plants. Other reasons for complexity are as follows:

a. Design procedures that result in a failure to identify hazards or operating problems until late in design. By this time, it is impossible to avoid the hazards, and all we can do is add complex equipment to control them (see Chapter 7).

b. A desire for flexibility. Multistream plants with numerous crossovers and valves, so that any item can be used on any stream, have numerous leakage points, and errors in valve settings are likely (Section 8.2).

c. Lavish provision of installed spares with the accompanying isolation and changeover valves (Section 8.1.4).

d. Persistence in following rules or practices that are no longer necessary (Section 8.1).

e. Our intolerance of risk. Do we go too far? (See Chapter 15.)

Equipment can, of course, combine more than one of the features of friendly plants, and they are interlinked. Thus, intensification and substitution often result in a simpler plant because there is less need for added safety equipment. At other times we may have to choose between, say, using a hazardous raw material in a reaction that cannot run away or using a less hazardous raw material in a reaction that may run away (Section 4.2.3).

6 Avoiding knock-on effects. Friendly plants are designed so that those incidents that do occur do not produce knock-on or domino effects. For example, friendly plants are provided with firebreaks between sections, like those in a forest, to restrict the spread of fire, or, if flammable materials are handled, the plants are built outdoors so that leaks can be dispersed by natural ventilation (Section

9.1).

7 Making incorrect assembly impossible. Friendly plants are designed so that incorrect assembly is difficult or impossible. For example, compressor valves should be designed so that inlet and exit valves cannot be interchanged (Section 9.2).

8 Making status clear. With friendly equipment, it is possible to see at a glance if it has been assembled or installed incorrectly or whether it is in the open or shut position. For example, check (nonreturn) valves should be marked so that installation the wrong way round is obvious (it should not be necessary to look for a faint arrow hardly visible beneath the dirt), and gate valves with rising spindles are friendlier than valves with nonrising spindles because it is easy to see whether they are open or shut. Ball valves are friendly if the handles cannot be replaced in the wrong position (Section 9.3).

9 Tolerance of misuse. Friendly equipment will tolerate poor installation or operation without failure. Thus, spiral-wound gaskets are friendlier than fiber gaskets, for if the bolts work loose or are not tightened correctly, the leak rate is much less. Expansion loops in pipework are more tolerant of poor installation than bellows. Fixed pipes, or articulated arms, if flexibility is necessary, are friendlier than hoses. For most applications, metal is friendlier than glass or plastic (Section 9.4). 10. Ease of control. When possible, we should control by the use of physical principles rather than adding control equipment. Thus, one flow can be made proportional to another by using flow ratio controllers, which may fail or be neglected or, a better way, by letting one fluid flow through an orifice and suck in the other through a sidearm (Section 3.2.3).

Friendly processes have a slow and flat response to change rather than a fast or steep one; very accurate measurements are not necessary, and the control limits are not close to the safe operating ones. The control and safety systems are resilient; i.e., they do not interfere with operations or maintenance to the extent that there is a temptation to bypass them.

Processes in which a rise of temperature decreases the rate of reaction are friendlier than those with a positive temperature coefficient, but this is a difficult ideal to achieve in the chemical industry. However, there are a few examples of processes in which a rise in temperature reduces the rate of reaction (Section 9.5).

11 Computer control. Friendly software is scrutable; i.e., it is easy to see whether or not it will do what we want it to do. Most software is not. In addition, software should be designed by people who understand the process. The software should allow for foreseeable hardware failures and should not overload operators with too much information, such as numerous alarms sounding at the same time. It also should have been tested thoroughly (though testing of every possible combination of conditions is impracticable). Old software should be reused with caution (Section 9.6).

12 Instructions and other procedures. Instructions should not try to cover every conceivable condition that might arise; otherwise, they will be so long and complex that no one will read them. Another reason for complexity is a desire to protect the writer rather than help the reader.

If many types of gaskets or nuts and bolts are stocked, sooner or later the wrong type will be installed. It is better, and cheaper in the long run, to keep the number of types stocked to a minimum, even though more expensive types than are strictly necessary are used for some applications (Section 9.7).

13 Life-cycle friendliness. We should consider the problems of construction and demolition as well as operation and maintenance (Section 9.8).

14 Passive safety. If we cannot avoid hazards and have to add protective measures, then whenever possible, they should be passive rather than active or procedural. For example, to prevent or reduce damage by fire, an active method is water spray turned on automatically by a flame or heat detector. A procedural method is water spray turned on by an operator. The equipment may fail or be switched off. The operator may fail. Fire insulation is passive; it is immediately available as a barrier to heat input and does not have to be commissioned. In nuclear reactors, pumped cooling is active; convective cooling is passive (Section 9.11).

It is the theme of this book that—instead of designing plants, identifying hazards, adding equipment to control the hazards, or expecting operators to control them—we should make more effort to choose basic designs, and design details, that are user-friendly. The chapters that follow give examples of what has been or might be done and discuss the action required. They also address the reasons that progress has not been more rapid than it has been and suggest that friendliness in plant design should be included in the training of chemical engineers (see Chapter 10).

Some of the equipment and processes I describe are well established; others are still under development, and some have still to be developed. Some may fall by the wayside. Higee distillation (Section 3.3.2) has not been as successful as I thought it would be when it became available, though I remain hopeful. Published accounts of new inventions are usually based on information from inventors and manufacturers and do not always list the disadvantages. The primary aim of this book, however, is not to provide a catalog of ready-made solutions, but to stimulate thought, and even unsuccessful ideas may do that. If the relevant inherent-safety questions are not asked when attempting to facilitate user-friendliness of process plants, then potential process or product alternatives cannot be explored.

Chapter length gives a very rough indication of the extent to which the various techniques can be used.

A few examples from industries besides the chemical industry are includedparticularly nuclear power (Section 9.11 and Chapter 12). The particular issue of dust explosions is addressed in Chapter 13.

Table 1.1 summarizes the ways in which plants can be made user-friendly, and the appendix at the end of the book illustrates the principal ways in a more striking form. Note that there are always exceptions to Table 1.1.

Though this book is primarily concerned with safety, most of what is said applies also to the prevention of waste and pollution and the avoidance of those small continuous leaks into the atmosphere of the workplace that are the subject of industrial hygiene. It is better to avoid the production of pollutants and waste than to remove them by adding end-of-pipe equipment. Although simpler plants contain fewer joints and valve glands through which leaks can occur, whenever possible we should substitute safer solvents for toxic ones, such as benzene.

There has been an increasing recognition over the past decade that the principles of inherent safety have a key role to play in the field of environmental process engineering. More broadly, the integration of environmental (E) with health (H) and safety (S) concepts is clearly a topical issue in engineering research and practice.

In practice, reciprocating internal combustion engines are not less friendly than rotating engines, though one might expect equipment that continually starts and stops to be less reliable.

As noted in the previously mentioned item 13, it is important to adopt a life-cycle approach when dealing with EHS integration throughout all phases of plant design, construction, operation, and shutdown. A publication of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers 3 highlights the benefits to be gained by integrating the concepts afforded by various paradigms within the EHS field (Table 1.2).

Recent work at ETH Zurich 4 has focused on comparing various methods for assessing EHS hazards in early-stage chemical process design. Environmental hazard categories considered in this work include persistence in air, water, and soil; solid waste; bioaccumulation; and other issues such as global warming potential and ozone depletion potential. Health hazard categories include dispersion, acute toxicity, irritation, and chronic toxicity; safety hazard categories consist of mobility (e.g., vapor pressure), fire/explosion, reaction/decomposition, and acute toxicity. Interestingly, the various assessment methods yielded results in general agreement, with no one method having a unique advantage in terms of EHS coverage. Linking of safety and environmental concerns with the additional consideration of optimized process scheduling has similarly been achieved by a team at Texas A&M University.5 

### 1.2 Inherently Safer and Friendlier Design as Part of an Overall Approach

The steps to be followed are often summarized as identify, prevent, control, and mitigate hazards. Inherently safer and friendlier design might be described as part of prevention, but it is better to use the additional guide words avoid or reduce because designers seem to respond to the word prevent by adding protective equipment (Table 10.3).

This book describes various ways of making plants friendlier. On the whole, the earlier chapters, summarized in items 1–5 in the preceding section (i.e., the key principles of inherent safety), will help us avoid major hazards, whereas the later ones, items 6–14, will help us avoid the less serious ones.

We cannot, of course, avoid every hazard, and then we have to prevent, control, and mitigate. The methods we can use are, in the usual order of preference, passive, active, and procedural, as discussed previously and in Table 10.3. An early introduction to the ideas expressed in Table 10.3 is given at the end of this chapter in Section 1.3.

Inherently safer and friendly features should be introduced during design. It is often difficult and expensive to incorporate them into an existing plant. However, stocks can always be reduced (Section 3.6), and Section 3.2.9 describes the way an old plant was made inherently safer.

As stated at the beginning of this chapter, inherently safer and user-friendly designs are not merely desirable but isolated features but rather parts of a total package of improvements that the process industry needs: a move toward plants that are simpler, cheaper, and safer and that use less energy, need less maintenance, and produce less waste and pollution (Section 2.4).

As already stated, friendly plants are often cheaper than hostile ones. To quote a misprint in an English newspaper, we can have “Wealth and Safety at Work.”6  Table 1.3 summarizes the principal ways in which friendliness can be achieved and the effects on costs.

### 1.3 Hierarchy of Controls

To conclude this introductory chapter, the order of preference for safety control measures (referenced in Section 1.2) is presented as a partial answer to the question posed by the chapter title: “What are inherently safer and user-friendly plants?” Simply put, such plants are designed and operated according to the systematic approach to loss prevention illustrated in Figure 1.1. With this approach, the preferred order of consideration for risk-reduction measures is—from most to least effective—inherent, passive engineered, active engineered, and procedural safety. This is akin to the layer of protection analysis (LOPA) concept in which inherently safer process design sits at the central core of the layers.7 

Figure 1.1 A systematic approach to loss prevention (hierarchy of controls). 

Andrew Hopkins, in his book Safety, Culture and Risk: The Organizational Causes of Disasters, 8 uses the phrase hierarchy of controls to describe essentially the same idea; i.e., there is a hierarchical ordering of controls to deal with hazards and the ensuing risk. This hierarchy covers the spectrum from elimination (at the top of the hierarchy) through engineering and administrative (procedural) controls, to PPE (personal protective equipment) at the bottom of the hierarchy. Manuele 9 calls this sequence the safety decision hierarchy.

It is important to keep in mind two critical features of the hierarchy of controls. First, this concept clearly indicates that inherent safety is not a stand-alone concept. Inherent safety works through a hierarchical arrangement in concert with engineered (passive and active) and procedural safety to reduce risk. Second, the hierarchy of controls does not invalidate the usefulness of engineered and procedural safety measures. Quite the opposite: The hierarchy of controls recognizes the importance of engineered and procedural safety by highlighting the need for careful examination of the reliability of both mechanical devices and human actions. These considerations must therefore be incorporated into the overall process of risk assessment.

The systematic, hierarchical approach displayed in Figure 1.1 affords practitioners the opportunity to bring their own interpretations to the quest for user-friendly process plants. One person’s intensify may be another’s minimize. Someone’s attenuate may be someone else’s moderate. You may wish to consider segregate (i.e., unit segregation) as a measure separate from inherent safety; your colleague may consider it as a form of limitation of effects. As previously mentioned, the characteristics of a user-friendly plant are sometimes not sharply divided and may merge into one another. Process design, like life, is seldom linear.
