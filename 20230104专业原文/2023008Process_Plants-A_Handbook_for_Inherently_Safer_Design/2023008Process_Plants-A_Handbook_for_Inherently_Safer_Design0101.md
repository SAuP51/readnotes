## 0101. Introduction: What Are Inherently Safer and User-Friendly Plants?

We can pull and haul and push and drive, 

We can print and plough and weave and heat and light, 

We can run and race and swim and fly and drive, 

We can see and hear and count and read and write.…

But remember please, the law by which we live, 

We are not built to comprehend a lie, 

We can neither love nor pity nor forgive

If you make a slip in handling us, you die.

— Rudyard Kipling, “The Secret of the Machines”

### 1.1 Introduction

The aim of this book is to show that the last line in the poem above need not always be true and that we can often design plants that can tolerate human error and equipment failure without serious effects on safety, output, and efficiency.

The chemical industry expanded rapidly during the 1960s, and two unforeseen results were a series of major fires and explosions, culminating in those at Flixborough, United Kingdom, and Seveso, Italy, and a consequent demand for higher standards of safety. In response, the industry installed more and more safety equipment, and costs rose. People began to ask, “Where will it end?” “How much safety equipment should we add to our plants?” One answer was quantitative risk assessment: setting a target level of risk and not going beyond it (see Chapter 15). This approach has become widely accepted; it is an approach I use and advocate.1  Nevertheless, it should be our second-best choice. Before we estimate the probability and consequences of a hazard and compare them with a target, we should ask whether the hazard can be eliminated.

In all industries, equipment failures and errors by operators and maintenance workers are recognized as major causes of accidents, and much thought has been given to ways of reducing them or minimizing their consequences. 2 However, it is difficult for operators and maintenance workers to keep up an error-free performance all day, every day. We may keep up a tip-top performance for an hour or so while playing a game or a piece of music, but we cannot keep it up continuously. Designers have a second chance, opportunities to go over their designs again, but operators and maintenance workers do not get second chances. Plants should therefore be designed, whenever possible, so that they are user-friendly, to borrow a computer term, and can tolerate departures from ideal performance by operators or maintenance workers without serious effects on safety, output, or efficiency.

Similarly, although much attention has been paid to the improvement of equipment reliability, 100% reliability is unattainable, and compromises have to be made between reliability and cost. Plants should therefore be designed, whenever possible, so that equipment failure does not seriously affect safety, output, and efficiency.

These arguments apply to all industry but particularly to the chemical and nuclear industries, where hazardous materials are handled and the consequences of failure—by people or equipment—are serious. The levels of reliability required are high and may be beyond the capabilities of people or materials. For example, a joint leaked after a shutdown in which 2000 joints were broken and remade. Only one was remade incorrectly, but it was the only one that anyone heard about. Afterward, the fiber gaskets in most of the 5000 joints in the unit—all those exposed to liquid—were replaced by friendlier spiral-wound gaskets.

A hazard is a situation that can lead to harm. A risk is the probability that the harm will occur. Traditional plant designs try to reduce the risk by adding protective equipment and following safe methods of working. Inherently safer and friendlier plants remove or reduce the hazards. Following traditional methods, we become more and more efficient at things we should not be doing, except as a last resort.

The ways by which friendliness in plant design can be achieved are summarized below and discussed in detail in later chapters. The characteristics are not sharply defined and merge into each other.

1 Intensification or minimization. Friendly plants contain low inventories of hazardous materials—so little that it does not matter if the entire inventory leaks out. What you don’t have, can’t leak. This may seem obvious, but until the explosion at Flixborough in 1974, little thought was given to ways of reducing the amount of hazardous material in a plant. Engineers simply designed a plant and accepted whatever inventory the design required, confident that they could keep it under control. At Bhopal, India, in 1984, the material that leaked, killing over 2000 people, was an intermediate that was convenient, but not essential, to store. Inventories can often be reduced in almost all unit operations as well as during storage (see Chapter 3).

2 Substitution. If intensification is not possible, then an alternative is substitution: using a safer material in place of a hazardous one. Thus, it may be possible to replace flammable refrigerants and heat-transfer media by nonflammable ones, hazardous products by safer ones, and processes that use hazardous raw materials or intermediates by processes that do not (see Chapter 4).

Intensification, when it is practicable, is better than substitution because it brings about greater reductions in cost. If less material is present, we need smaller pipes and vessels as well as smaller structures and foundations. Much of the pressure for intensification has come from those who are primarily concerned with cost reduction. In fact, friendliness in plant design is not only an isolated concept but a desirable one in a total package of measures, including cost reduction, lower energy usage, and simplification that the chemical industry needs to continue to adopt in the years ahead (Section 2.4).

3 Attenuation or moderation. Another alternative to intensification is attenuation by using a hazardous material under the least hazardous conditions. Thus, liquefied chlorine and ammonia can be stored as refrigerated liquids at atmospheric pressure instead of storage under pressure at ambient temperature. Dyestuffs that form explosive dusts can be handled as slurries (see Chapter 5).

Attenuation (moderation) is sometimes the reverse of intensification (minimization), for if we make reaction conditions less extreme, we may need a longer residence time and a larger inventory. In designing friendly plants, we may have to compromise by considering different possibilities (see the quotation by David Pye at the front of the book).

4 Limitation of effects (a form of moderation) by changing designs or reaction conditions rather than by adding protective equipment that may fail or be neglected. If friendly equipment does leak, it does so at a low rate, which is easy to stop or control. Spiral-wound gaskets, as already mentioned, are friendlier than fiber gaskets because, if the bolts work loose or are not tightened correctly, the leak rate is lower. A tubular reactor is friendlier than a pot (batch) reactor because the leak rate is limited by the cross section of the pipe and can be stopped by closing a valve in the pipe. Vapor-phase reactors are friendlier than liquid-phase reactors, for the mass flow rate through a hole of a given size is less.

By changing reaction conditions (e.g., the temperature or the order of operations), it is often possible to prevent runaways or make them less likely. By carrying out different stages of a batch process in different vessels, it may be possible to tailor the equipment more closely to the needs of each step. By using steam or oil as a heating medium, and limiting its temperature, it may be possible to prevent overheating (see Chapter 6).

Intensification, substitution, attenuation, and limitation of effects produce inherently safer design because they avoid hazards instead of controlling them by adding protective equipment. The term inherently safer implies that the process is safer because of its very nature and not because equipment has been added to make it safer. Note that we talk of inherently safer plants, not inherently safe ones, for we cannot remove all hazards. Note also that some writers use the term inherently safer design in a wider sense to include all the methods of making plants friendlier that I discuss in this book. Some go even further and expand the concept of inherently safer designs to include methods of locating or confining equipment so that the effects of fires and explosions are minimized. I regard such protective measures as add-ons. The inherently safer solutions use nonflammable materials or so little flammable material that a leak would hardly matter or, if that is impossible, to use the hazardous material in the least hazardous form. If we make the definition of any concept too broad, designers will say they are using it when they are barely doing so.

To use an analogy, How deep does the water have to be before we can say we are bathing? Walking in water up to our ankles may be better than nothing, but hardly allows us to claim we are bathing.

5 Simplicity. Simpler plants are friendlier than complex plants because they provide fewer opportunities for error and less equipment that can fail. They are usually also cheaper.

The main reason for complexity in plant design is the need to add equipment to control hazards. Inherently safer plants are therefore also simpler plants. Other reasons for complexity are as follows:

a. Design procedures that result in a failure to identify hazards or operating problems until late in design. By this time, it is impossible to avoid the hazards, and all we can do is add complex equipment to control them (see Chapter 7).

b. A desire for flexibility. Multistream plants with numerous crossovers and valves, so that any item can be used on any stream, have numerous leakage points, and errors in valve settings are likely (Section 8.2).

c. Lavish provision of installed spares with the accompanying isolation and changeover valves (Section 8.1.4).

d. Persistence in following rules or practices that are no longer necessary (Section 8.1).

e. Our intolerance of risk. Do we go too far? (See Chapter 15.)

Equipment can, of course, combine more than one of the features of friendly plants, and they are interlinked. Thus, intensification and substitution often result in a simpler plant because there is less need for added safety equipment. At other times we may have to choose between, say, using a hazardous raw material in a reaction that cannot run away or using a less hazardous raw material in a reaction that may run away (Section 4.2.3).

6 Avoiding knock-on effects. Friendly plants are designed so that those incidents that do occur do not produce knock-on or domino effects. For example, friendly plants are provided with firebreaks between sections, like those in a forest, to restrict the spread of fire, or, if flammable materials are handled, the plants are built outdoors so that leaks can be dispersed by natural ventilation (Section 9.1).

7 Making incorrect assembly impossible. Friendly plants are designed so that incorrect assembly is difficult or impossible. For example, compressor valves should be designed so that inlet and exit valves cannot be interchanged (Section 9.2).

8 Making status clear. With friendly equipment, it is possible to see at a glance if it has been assembled or installed incorrectly or whether it is in the open or shut position. For example, check (nonreturn) valves should be marked so that installation the wrong way round is obvious (it should not be necessary to look for a faint arrow hardly visible beneath the dirt), and gate valves with rising spindles are friendlier than valves with nonrising spindles because it is easy to see whether they are open or shut. Ball valves are friendly if the handles cannot be replaced in the wrong position (Section 9.3).

9 Tolerance of misuse. Friendly equipment will tolerate poor installation or operation without failure. Thus, spiral-wound gaskets are friendlier than fiber gaskets, for if the bolts work loose or are not tightened correctly, the leak rate is much less. Expansion loops in pipework are more tolerant of poor installation than bellows. Fixed pipes, or articulated arms, if flexibility is necessary, are friendlier than hoses. For most applications, metal is friendlier than glass or plastic (Section 9.4). 

10 Ease of control. When possible, we should control by the use of physical principles rather than adding control equipment. Thus, one flow can be made proportional to another by using flow ratio controllers, which may fail or be neglected or, a better way, by letting one fluid flow through an orifice and suck in the other through a sidearm (Section 3.2.3).

Friendly processes have a slow and flat response to change rather than a fast or steep one; very accurate measurements are not necessary, and the control limits are not close to the safe operating ones. The control and safety systems are resilient; i.e., they do not interfere with operations or maintenance to the extent that there is a temptation to bypass them.

Processes in which a rise of temperature decreases the rate of reaction are friendlier than those with a positive temperature coefficient, but this is a difficult ideal to achieve in the chemical industry. However, there are a few examples of processes in which a rise in temperature reduces the rate of reaction (Section 9.5).

11 Computer control. Friendly software is scrutable; i.e., it is easy to see whether or not it will do what we want it to do. Most software is not. In addition, software should be designed by people who understand the process. The software should allow for foreseeable hardware failures and should not overload operators with too much information, such as numerous alarms sounding at the same time. It also should have been tested thoroughly (though testing of every possible combination of conditions is impracticable). Old software should be reused with caution (Section 9.6).

12 Instructions and other procedures. Instructions should not try to cover every conceivable condition that might arise; otherwise, they will be so long and complex that no one will read them. Another reason for complexity is a desire to protect the writer rather than help the reader.

If many types of gaskets or nuts and bolts are stocked, sooner or later the wrong type will be installed. It is better, and cheaper in the long run, to keep the number of types stocked to a minimum, even though more expensive types than are strictly necessary are used for some applications (Section 9.7).

13 Life-cycle friendliness. We should consider the problems of construction and demolition as well as operation and maintenance (Section 9.8).

14 Passive safety. If we cannot avoid hazards and have to add protective measures, then whenever possible, they should be passive rather than active or procedural. For example, to prevent or reduce damage by fire, an active method is water spray turned on automatically by a flame or heat detector. A procedural method is water spray turned on by an operator. The equipment may fail or be switched off. The operator may fail. Fire insulation is passive; it is immediately available as a barrier to heat input and does not have to be commissioned. In nuclear reactors, pumped cooling is active; convective cooling is passive (Section 9.11).

It is the theme of this book that—instead of designing plants, identifying hazards, adding equipment to control the hazards, or expecting operators to control them—we should make more effort to choose basic designs, and design details, that are user-friendly. The chapters that follow give examples of what has been or might be done and discuss the action required. They also address the reasons that progress has not been more rapid than it has been and suggest that friendliness in plant design should be included in the training of chemical engineers (see Chapter 10).

Some of the equipment and processes I describe are well established; others are still under development, and some have still to be developed. Some may fall by the wayside. Higee distillation (Section 3.3.2) has not been as successful as I thought it would be when it became available, though I remain hopeful. Published accounts of new inventions are usually based on information from inventors and manufacturers and do not always list the disadvantages. The primary aim of this book, however, is not to provide a catalog of ready-made solutions, but to stimulate thought, and even unsuccessful ideas may do that. If the relevant inherent-safety questions are not asked when attempting to facilitate user-friendliness of process plants, then potential process or product alternatives cannot be explored.

Chapter length gives a very rough indication of the extent to which the various techniques can be used.

A few examples from industries besides the chemical industry are includedparticularly nuclear power (Section 9.11 and Chapter 12). The particular issue of dust explosions is addressed in Chapter 13.

Table 1.1 summarizes the ways in which plants can be made user-friendly, and the appendix at the end of the book illustrates the principal ways in a more striking form. Note that there are always exceptions to Table 1.1.

Though this book is primarily concerned with safety, most of what is said applies also to the prevention of waste and pollution and the avoidance of those small continuous leaks into the atmosphere of the workplace that are the subject of industrial hygiene. It is better to avoid the production of pollutants and waste than to remove them by adding end-of-pipe equipment. Although simpler plants contain fewer joints and valve glands through which leaks can occur, whenever possible we should substitute safer solvents for toxic ones, such as benzene.

There has been an increasing recognition over the past decade that the principles of inherent safety have a key role to play in the field of environmental process engineering. More broadly, the integration of environmental (E) with health (H) and safety (S) concepts is clearly a topical issue in engineering research and practice.

Table 1.1 Ways of Making Plants Friendlier

Note: See chapter or section referenced for more information. Note that there may be exceptions to some of these general rules.

a AGR = advanced gas-cooled reactor, HTGR = high-temperature gas reactor, PIUS = process-inherent ultimate safety reactor, FBR = fast breeder reactor, PWR = pressurized-water reactor, PES = programmable electronic system.

b In practice, reciprocating internal combustion engines are not less friendly than rotating engines, though one might expect equipment that continually starts and stops to be less reliable.

As noted in the previously mentioned item 13, it is important to adopt a life-cycle approach when dealing with EHS integration throughout all phases of plant design, construction, operation, and shutdown. A publication of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers 3 highlights the benefits to be gained by integrating the concepts afforded by various paradigms within the EHS field (Table 1.2).

Recent work at ETH Zurich 4 has focused on comparing various methods for assessing EHS hazards in early-stage chemical process design. Environmental hazard categories considered in this work include persistence in air, water, and soil; solid waste; bioaccumulation; and other issues such as global warming potential and ozone depletion potential. Health hazard categories include dispersion, acute toxicity, irritation, and chronic toxicity; safety hazard categories consist of mobility (e.g., vapor pressure), fire/explosion, reaction/decomposition, and acute toxicity. Interestingly, the various assessment methods yielded results in general agreement, with no one method having a unique advantage in terms of EHS coverage. Linking of safety and environmental concerns with the additional consideration of optimized process scheduling has similarly been achieved by a team at Texas A&M University.5 

这本书的目标是表明，上面诗歌的最后一句并非总是正确的，我们常常能设计出能够承受人为错误和设备故障而对安全、产出和效率无重大影响的工厂。

化学工业在 1960 年代迅速扩展，而两个未预见到的结果是一系列大火和爆炸的发生，最终在英国的弗利克斯堡和意大利的塞韦索达到高峰，因此对更高安全标准的需求应运而生。作为回应，这个行业安装了越来越多的安全设备，成本也随之上升。人们开始问，「这个会到哪一步？」「我们应该在工厂中增加多少安全设备？」一个回答是定量风险评估：设定一个风险目标水平，然后不超过它（见第 15 章）。这种方法已经被广泛接受；这是我使用并主张的方法。1 然而，这应该是我们的第二选择。在我们估算危险的概率和后果，并将它们与一个目标进行比较之前，我们应该问是否可以消除这个危险。

在所有行业中，设备故障和操作员及维修工人的错误都被认为是事故的主要原因，人们对如何减少这些错误或者最小化它们的后果进行了大量的思考。2 然而，对于操作员和维修工人来说，要在每一天的每一时刻都保持零错误的表现是很困难的。我们可能在玩游戏或演奏一首音乐时保持一小时左右的最佳表现，但我们不能持续保持这样的表现。设计师有第二次机会，可以重新审视他们的设计，但是操作员和维修工人没有第二次机会。因此，只要可能，工厂应该被设计得用户友好，借用一个计算机术语，能够在操作员或维修工人的表现偏离理想状态时，不对安全、产出或效率产生重大影响。

同样，虽然人们已经对设备可靠性的提高付出了很多关注，但 100% 的可靠性是无法达到的，必须在可靠性和成本之间进行权衡。因此，只要可能，工厂应该被设计得能够承受设备故障，而不会对安全、产出和效率产生重大影响。

这些论点适用于所有行业，尤其是化学和核工业，这些行业需要处理危险物质，而人为或设备的失败所带来的后果是严重的。所需的可靠性水平很高，可能超出了人类或材料的能力。例如，在一次停机中，2000 个接头被拆解并重新组装，只有一个被错误地重新组装，但这是唯一一个人们听说过的。后来，该单元中大部分 5000 个接头（所有暴露在液体中的部分）的纤维垫片都被更友好的螺旋缠绕垫片替换。

危险是可能导致伤害的情况。风险是伤害发生的概率。传统的工厂设计试图通过增加保护设备和遵循安全的工作方法来降低风险。本质上更安全和更友好的工厂消除或减少了危险。按照传统的方法，我们在我们不应该做的事情上变得越来越高效，除非作为最后的手段。

在工厂设计中实现友好性的方式如下所述，并将在后续章节中详细讨论。这些特征并没有明确的定义，而是相互交融。

1 集约化或最小化。友好的工厂存储的危险物质库存量很低，低到即使整个库存泄露出来也没有关系。你没有的东西，就不会泄露。这可能看起来显而易见，但直到 1974 年弗利克斯堡的爆炸事件之前，人们几乎没有思考过如何减少工厂中危险物质的数量。工程师们只是简单地设计了一个工厂，并接受了设计所需的任何库存，他们有信心能够控制住它。在 1984 年的印度博帕尔，泄露的物质造成了 2000 多人死亡，这种物质是方便但不必要的存储中间产品。在几乎所有的单元操作以及存储期间，库存通常都可以减少（见第 3 章）。

2 替代。如果集约化不可能，那么另一种选择是替代：使用更安全的物质代替危险的物质。因此，我们可能可以将易燃的制冷剂和热传递介质替换为不易燃的物质，将危险的产品替换为更安全的产品，将使用危险原材料或中间产品的过程替换为不使用这些物质的过程（见第 4 章）。

在实际可行的情况下，集约化比替代更好，因为它可以带来更大的成本削减。如果物质较少，我们需要的管道和容器也就越小，同样，结构和基础设施也就越小。集约化的压力主要来自那些主要关注成本削减的人。事实上，工厂设计的友好性不仅是一个独立的概念，而且是一整套措施中的一种期望，包括成本削减、能源使用降低和化工行业在未来几年需要继续采取的简化，这是一个整体的包装（第 2.4 节）。

3 减弱或调和。另一种集约化的替代方案是使用危险物质在最不危险的条件下进行减弱。因此，液化氯和氨可以作为在大气压下的冷却液储存，而不是在环境温度下进行加压储存。那些形成爆炸性粉尘的染料可以作为浆料处理（见第 5 章）。

减弱（调和）有时与集约化（最小化）相反，因为如果我们使反应条件较为温和，我们可能需要更长的驻留时间和更大的库存。在设计友好的工厂时，我们可能需要通过考虑不同的可能性来做出妥协（参见书前 David Pye 的引言）。

4 效果限制（一种形式的调和）通过改变设计或反应条件，而不是通过添加可能失败或被忽视的保护设备。如果友好的设备确实发生泄漏，泄漏速率较低，容易停止或控制。如前所述，螺旋缠绕垫片比纤维垫片更友好，因为如果螺栓松动或没有正确拧紧，泄漏速率会更低。管式反应器比罐式（批量）反应器更友好，因为泄漏率受到管道截面的限制，并且可以通过关闭管道中的阀门来停止泄漏。气相反应器比液相反应器更友好，因为通过给定大小的孔的质量流率更小。

通过改变反应条件（例如，温度或操作顺序），通常可以防止暴走反应或使其不太可能发生。通过在不同的容器中进行批量过程的不同阶段，可能可以更精确地根据每个步骤的需要来调整设备。通过使用蒸汽或油作为加热介质，并限制其温度，可能可以防止过热（见第 6 章）。

集约化、替代、减弱和效果限制产生本质上更安全的设计，因为它们避免了危险，而不是通过添加保护设备来控制它们。本质安全这个术语意味着，这个过程之所以更安全，是因为其本身的性质，而不是因为添加了设备使其变得更安全。注意，我们讨论的是本质上更安全的工厂，而不是本质上安全的工厂，因为我们无法消除所有的危险。还要注意，一些作者将本质上更安全的设计这个术语用在更广泛的意义上，包括我在这本书中讨论的使工厂更友好的所有方法。有些人甚至进一步扩大了本质上更安全的设计的概念，包括定位或限制设备的方法，使得火灾和爆炸的影响最小化。我认为这些保护措施是附加的。本质上更安全的解决方案使用不易燃的材料或者易燃物质极少到泄漏都无所谓，或者，如果这是不可能的，那么使用最不危险形态的危险物质。如果我们把任何概念的定义做得太宽泛，设计者会说他们在使用它，但他们实际上几乎没有这么做。

用一个类比来说，水需要多深我们才能说我们在游泳呢？在只及脚踝深的水里走可能比什么都没有要好，但几乎不能让我们声称我们在游泳。

5 简单性。简单的工厂比复杂的工厂更友好，因为它们为错误和设备故障提供了更少的机会。它们通常也更便宜。

工厂设计复杂的主要原因是需要添加设备来控制危险。因此，本质上更安全的工厂也是更简单的工厂。复杂性的其他原因如下：

a. 导致在设计晚期才能识别出危险或操作问题的设计程序。到那时，我们已经无法避免这些危险，我们只能添加复杂的设备来控制它们（见第 7 章）。

b. 对灵活性的追求。具有众多交叉点和阀门的多流程工厂，使得任何项目都可以在任何流程中使用，都有很多泄漏点，并且阀门设置的错误很可能发生（第 8.2 节）。

c. 大量的备用设备提供，以及伴随的隔离和转换阀门（第 8.1.4 节）。

d. 对不再必要的规则或实践的坚持（第 8.1 节）。

e. 我们对风险的不容忍。我们走得太远了吗？（见第 15 章）。

当然，设备可以结合友好工厂的多个特点，并且它们是相互关联的。因此，集约化和替代往往会导致工厂更简单，因为不再需要添加那么多的安全设备。在其他时候，我们可能需要在使用无法失控的反应中使用危险的原料，或者在可能失控的反应中使用较不危险的原料之间进行选择（第 4.2.3 节）。

6 避免连锁反应。友好的工厂被设计为，即使发生事故，也不会产生连锁或多米诺效应。例如，友好的工厂在各个区域之间设有防火隔离带，就像森林中的那样，以限制火势的蔓延，或者，如果处理可燃物质，工厂则在户外建造，这样泄漏物可以通过自然通风来分散（第 9.1 节）。

7 使错误的组装不可能。友好的工厂被设计为使错误的组装变得困难或不可能。例如，应设计压缩机阀门，使进气阀和排气阀不能互换（第 9.2 节）。

8 明确状态。对于友好的设备，人们可以一眼看出是否安装或安装错误，或者是处于开启还是关闭状态。例如，应标记检查（单向）阀，使得错误的安装方式显而易见（不应需要寻找几乎被污垢覆盖的微弱箭头），带有升降轴的闸阀比不带升降轴的阀门更友好，因为很容易看出它们是否开启或关闭。如果球阀的手柄不能错误地放回原位，那么它们就是友好的（第 9.3 节）。

9 容忍误用。友好的设备将容忍差劲的安装或操作而不出现故障。因此，螺旋缠绕垫片比纤维垫片更友好，因为如果螺栓松动或未正确拧紧，泄漏率要小得多。管道中的膨胀环比波纹管更能容忍差劲的安装。如果需要灵活性，则固定的管道或关节臂比软管更友好。对于大多数应用来说，金属比玻璃或塑料更友好（第 9.4 节）。

10 易于控制。在可能的情况下，我们应该通过使用物理原理来控制，而不是添加控制设备。因此，可以通过使用流量比例控制器使一个流量与另一个流量成比例，这可能会失败或被忽视，或者，更好的方法是，让一个流体通过孔径流动并通过侧臂吸入另一个流体（第 3.2.3 节）。

友好的过程对变化的反应慢而平缓，而不是快速或陡峭的；不需要非常精确的测量，控制极限并未接近安全运行极限。控制和安全系统是有弹性的；也就是说，它们不会干扰操作或维护，以至于有人会想要绕过它们。

温度上升反应速率减慢的过程比正温度系数的过程更友好，但在化工行业，这是一个难以实现的理想。然而，有少数过程中，温度的升高会降低反应的速率（第 9.5 节）。

11 计算机控制。友好的软件是可审查的；也就是说，我们可以轻易地看出它是否会按我们的意愿工作。然而，大多数软件做不到这一点。此外，软件应由了解该过程的人员设计。软件应考虑到可预见的硬件故障，不应用太多信息（如同时响起的多个警报）过度负荷操作员。同时，软件也应经过彻底的测试（尽管对所有可能的条件组合进行测试是不切实际的）。旧的软件应谨慎复用（第 9.6 节）。

12 指令和其他程序。指令不应试图覆盖可能出现的所有想得到的条件；否则，它们会变得如此冗长和复杂，以至于没有人会阅读它们。复杂性的另一个原因是想保护作者而不是帮助读者。

如果库存有许多种类型的垫片或螺母和螺栓，那么迟早会安装错类型。从长远来看，最好（也更便宜）的方式是将库存类型的数量降至最低，尽管对于某些应用来说，使用的类型比严格必要的类型更贵（第 9.7 节）。

13 生命周期的友好性。我们应考虑到建设和拆除的问题，以及运行和维护的问题（第 9.8 节）。

14 被动安全。如果我们无法避免危险并且必须增加防护措施，那么在可能的情况下，它们应该是被动的，而不是主动的或程序化的。例如，为了防止或减少火灾损害，一种主动的方法是通过火焰或热探测器自动启动的喷水。一种程序化的方法是由操作员打开的喷水。设备可能会失败或被关闭。操作员可能会出错。火灾保温是被动的；它立即可以作为阻止热量输入的障碍，无需进行投入使用。在核反应堆中，泵送冷却是主动的；对流冷却是被动的（第 9.11 节）。

本书的主题是，我们应该更多地努力选择基本设计和设计细节，使其用户友好，而不是设计工厂、识别危险、增加设备来控制危险或期望操作员来控制它们。接下来的章节将给出已经完成或可能完成的例子，并讨论需要采取的行动。它们还讨论了为什么进步的速度没有比现在更快，并建议在化学工程师的培训中应包含工厂设计的友好性（参见第 10 章）。

我描述的一些设备和过程已经得到了充分的确认；其他一些还在开发中，有些还需要开发。有些可能会被淘汰。Higee 蒸馏（第 3.3.2 节）并没有像我预期的那样成功，虽然我仍然保持希望。新发明的公开账目通常基于发明者和制造商的信息，并不总是列出缺点。然而，本书的主要目的不是提供一本现成解决方案的目录，而是刺激思考，甚至失败的想法也可能做到这一点。如果在试图使过程工厂的用户友好性时不提出相关的内在安全问题，那么就无法探索潜在的过程或产品替代品。

章节的长度给出了各种技术可用程度的非常粗略的指示。

书中也包括了一些除化工行业以外的行业的例子，特别是核电（第 9.11 节和第 12 章）。粉尘爆炸的特定问题在第 13 章中得到了解决。

表 1.1 总结了使工厂用户友好的方式，书末的附录以更为引人注目的形式展示了主要的方式。请注意，表 1.1 总是存在例外。

尽管这本书主要关注安全，但大部分内容也适用于防止浪费和污染，以及避免那些小的、连续的向工作场所大气中泄漏的主题，这是工业卫生的主题。避免产生污染物和废物总比通过增加管道末端设备来去除它们要好。尽管较简单的工厂包含的接头和阀门腺体较少，从而可以发生泄漏，但只要可能，我们应该用安全的溶剂替代有毒的溶剂，如苯。

过去十年来，人们日益认识到，内在安全的原则在环境过程工程领域起着关键作用。更广泛地说，将环境（E）与健康（H）和安全（S）概念相结合显然是工程研究和实践中的热点问题。

a AGR = 先进的燃气冷却反应堆，HTGR = 高温气体反应堆，PIUS = 过程固有的终极安全反应堆，FBR = 快中子增殖反应堆，PWR = 压水反应堆，PES = 可编程电子系统。

b 在实践中，往复式内燃机并不比旋转发动机更不友好，尽管人们可能会期望那些不断启动和停止的设备的可靠性较低。

正如前面提到的第 13 点所指出的，当在工厂设计、建设、运行和关闭的所有阶段处理 EHS 整合时，采用生命周期方法是非常重要的。美国化学工程师协会的一份出版物 3 强调了通过在 EHS 领域内的各种范例中整合概念可以获得的好处（表 1.2）。

苏黎世联邦理工学院最近的工作 4 集中比较了在早期化学过程设计中评估 EHS 风险的各种方法。在这项工作中考虑的环境危害类别包括在空气、水和土壤中的持久性；固体废物；生物富集；以及全球变暖潜能和臭氧耗竭潜能等其他问题。健康危害类别包括分散性、急性毒性、刺激性和慢性毒性；安全危害类别包括流动性（例如，蒸汽压力）、火灾 / 爆炸、反应 / 分解和急性毒性。有趣的是，各种评估方法得出的结果基本一致，没有一种方法在 EHS 覆盖范围上具有独特的优势。得克萨斯 A&M 大学的一个团队也成功地将安全和环境问题与优化过程调度的额外考虑因素结合起来。5

### 1.2 Inherently Safer and Friendlier Design as Part of an Overall Approach

The steps to be followed are often summarized as identify, prevent, control, and mitigate hazards. Inherently safer and friendlier design might be described as part of prevention, but it is better to use the additional guide words avoid or reduce because designers seem to respond to the word prevent by adding protective equipment (Table 10.3).

This book describes various ways of making plants friendlier. On the whole, the earlier chapters, summarized in items 1–5 in the preceding section (i.e., the key principles of inherent safety), will help us avoid major hazards, whereas the later ones, items 6–14, will help us avoid the less serious ones.

We cannot, of course, avoid every hazard, and then we have to prevent, control, and mitigate. The methods we can use are, in the usual order of preference, passive, active, and procedural, as discussed previously and in Table 10.3. An early introduction to the ideas expressed in Table 10.3 is given at the end of this chapter in Section 1.3.

Inherently safer and friendly features should be introduced during design. It is often difficult and expensive to incorporate them into an existing plant. However, stocks can always be reduced (Section 3.6), and Section 3.2.9 describes the way an old plant was made inherently safer.

As stated at the beginning of this chapter, inherently safer and user-friendly designs are not merely desirable but isolated features but rather parts of a total package of improvements that the process industry needs: a move toward plants that are simpler, cheaper, and safer and that use less energy, need less maintenance, and produce less waste and pollution (Section 2.4).

As already stated, friendly plants are often cheaper than hostile ones. To quote a misprint in an English newspaper, we can have “Wealth and Safety at Work.”6  Table 1.3 summarizes the principal ways in which friendliness can be achieved and the effects on costs.

### 1.3 Hierarchy of Controls

To conclude this introductory chapter, the order of preference for safety control measures (referenced in Section 1.2) is presented as a partial answer to the question posed by the chapter title: “What are inherently safer and user-friendly plants?” Simply put, such plants are designed and operated according to the systematic approach to loss prevention illustrated in Figure 1.1. With this approach, the preferred order of consideration for risk-reduction measures is—from most to least effective—inherent, passive engineered, active engineered, and procedural safety. This is akin to the layer of protection analysis (LOPA) concept in which inherently safer process design sits at the central core of the layers.7 

Figure 1.1 A systematic approach to loss prevention (hierarchy of controls). 

Andrew Hopkins, in his book Safety, Culture and Risk: The Organizational Causes of Disasters, 8 uses the phrase hierarchy of controls to describe essentially the same idea; i.e., there is a hierarchical ordering of controls to deal with hazards and the ensuing risk. This hierarchy covers the spectrum from elimination (at the top of the hierarchy) through engineering and administrative (procedural) controls, to PPE (personal protective equipment) at the bottom of the hierarchy. Manuele 9 calls this sequence the safety decision hierarchy.

It is important to keep in mind two critical features of the hierarchy of controls. First, this concept clearly indicates that inherent safety is not a stand-alone concept. Inherent safety works through a hierarchical arrangement in concert with engineered (passive and active) and procedural safety to reduce risk. Second, the hierarchy of controls does not invalidate the usefulness of engineered and procedural safety measures. Quite the opposite: The hierarchy of controls recognizes the importance of engineered and procedural safety by highlighting the need for careful examination of the reliability of both mechanical devices and human actions. These considerations must therefore be incorporated into the overall process of risk assessment.

The systematic, hierarchical approach displayed in Figure 1.1 affords practitioners the opportunity to bring their own interpretations to the quest for user-friendly process plants. One person’s intensify may be another’s minimize. Someone’s attenuate may be someone else’s moderate. You may wish to consider segregate (i.e., unit segregation) as a measure separate from inherent safety; your colleague may consider it as a form of limitation of effects. As previously mentioned, the characteristics of a user-friendly plant are sometimes not sharply divided and may merge into one another. Process design, like life, is seldom linear.

作为这个介绍性章节的结尾，本章标题所提出的问题「什么是固有的更安全且用户友好的工厂？」的部分答案是，我们提出了安全控制措施的偏好顺序（在 1.2 节引用）。简单地说，这样的工厂是根据图 1.1 所示的防止损失的系统性方法设计和运营的。使用这种方法，对降低风险的措施的首选顺序是 —— 从最有效到最不有效 —— 固有的，被动工程化的，主动工程化的，和程序化的安全。这类似于保护层分析（LOPA）的概念，其中固有更安全的流程设计位于层的中心核心。7

图 1.1 防止损失的系统性方法（控制的等级制）。

Andrew Hopkins 在他的书「Safety, Culture and Risk: The Organizational Causes of Disasters」8中使用了控制的等级制这个短语来描述本质上相同的想法；也就是说，有一个处理危险和随之而来的风险的控制的等级排序。这个等级覆盖了从消除（在等级的顶部）通过工程和管理（程序）控制，到 PPE（个人防护装备）在等级的底部的全谱。Manuele 9 称这个顺序为安全决策等级制。

重要的是要记住控制的等级制的两个关键特征。首先，这个概念清楚地表明固有的安全不是一个独立的概念。固有的安全通过等级安排与工程化（被动和主动）和程序化的安全一起工作来降低风险。其次，控制的等级制并不否定工程化和程序化安全措施的有用性。恰恰相反：控制的等级制认识到了工程化和程序化安全的重要性，通过强调需要仔细检查机械设备和人为行为的可靠性。因此，这些考虑必须纳入风险评估的整个过程中。

图 1.1 中展示的系统性、等级制的方法给予从业者带来他们对寻求用户友好的流程工厂的自己的解释的机会。一个人的「加强」可能是另一个人的「减少」。某人的「削弱」可能是另一个人的「适度」。你可能希望将「隔离」（即，单元隔离）视为与固有安全分开的措施；你的同事可能将它视为限制影响的一种形式。如前所述，用户友好的工厂的特性有时并不是尖锐地分割，可能会相互融合。流程设计，就像生活一样，很少是线性的。
