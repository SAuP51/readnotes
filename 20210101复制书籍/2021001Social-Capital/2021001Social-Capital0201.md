# 0201. Social Capital and the Emergence of Social Structure: A Theory of Rational Choice

原书第八章

This chapter1 focuses on the problem of how rational actions lead to social structure. So far in this monograph, the social capital theory has been developed and research undertaken to understand the meaningful-ness of actions within the context of social structure. That is, the theory has addressed the issue of actions while acknowledging and recognizing the a priori existence and effect of social structure. What I propose to explore in this chapter is the plausibility that actions may lead to social structure. That is, I seek to develop some theoretical arguments to answer the question of whether rationality based on resource maintenance or defense, as well as resource expansion and gain, allows us to better understand the rules of interaction and the formation of primary social groups (e.g., the primordial group). And further, whether consideration of social capital’s relative utility to personal capital offers the theoretical plausibility that rational actions may indeed lead to the emergence of social structure beyond the primordial group.

This chapter sketches a theory proposing how actions may lead to the emergence of social structure. I choose to theorize this process because it should theoretically (logically) precede processes dealing with interdependence and mutual causation between structure and action. Once the issue of action leading to the emergence of structure is explicated, interdependence and interaction between the two should follow (action affects structure and structure affects action). By focusing on the issue of an emerging social structure, I hope to shed light on other critical issues involved in action theory: what rationality is, what principles guide action and interaction, and why social structures (group and collectivity) are not only possible but inevitable from such action and interaction principles.

1 A significant portion of this chapter was adapted and revised from Lin (1994a) with permission.

My basic arguments are three. First, rational action is seen as having multidimensional motives regarding valued resources. At least two are considered fundamental: minimization of loss and maximization of gain.

These are independent, though empirically correlated, calculations, with the former claiming priority over the latter (see Chapter 4). Second, these calculations, and the problem of succession, lead to rules of resource transfers and the primacy of the primordial group. Interactions and collective action in the primordial group are guided primarily by the sentiment to retain and defend resources and secondarily by the need to gain resources. Third, in general, the utility of social capital (resources embedded in social ties) substantially exceeds that of personal or human capital.

This calculation, in the face of the scarcity of valued resources, propels the extension of interactions beyond one’s primordial group. Once such ties and exchanges are formed, certain collective rules follow. These rules, beyond interacting actors’ original intents and interests, constitute the basis for social structure formation.

This chapter will follow some fundamental propositions concerning action and interaction in the proposed social capital theory (Chapter 5) to describe the primordial group’s formation and significance. It will then specify the relative utilities of human and social capital, and argue that social capital’s relative utility constitutes a motive for interaction and exchange with actors outside the primordial group. The chapter concludes with some further discussion on the nature of the emerging social structure. These explorations are speculative in nature and will be inevitably brief here. The purpose, nevertheless, is to present the key arguments and outline a set of propositions so that further elaboration and evaluation are possible.

Before we begin, it is useful to locate this problem in the context of theorization about social structure and action.

这一章 [1] 关注理性的行动如何导致了社会结构的生成。到目前为止，本书所阐述的社会资本理论与进行的研究都是在社会结构的背景内来理解行动的意义。也即，在承认社会结构的预先存在与影响的同时，理论已经提出了行动的问题。在这一章中我想提出来探讨的是行动是否可以导致结构的生成。我试着提出一些理论观点，来回答建立在资源维持或保护以及资源扩展或获得基础之上的理性，是否有助于我们更好地理解互动的规则与基本社会群体（如首要群体）的形成。从而进一步探讨，与个人资本相比，社会资本视角是否提供了一种似乎合理的理论解释：理性行动可能确实导致了超越首要群体（如家族）的社会结构的生成。

这一章简述了行动如何导致社会结构生成的理论。我选择阐述这个过程，是因为它在理论上（逻辑上）先于论述结构与行动之间的相互依存和互为因果关系的过程。阐述了导致结构生成的行动问题之后，我们就接着论述结构与行动之间的相互依赖与互动问题（行动影响着结构，同时结构也影响着行动）。弄清社会结构的生成问题，有助于解决涉及到行动理论的其他重要问题：理性是什么，什么原则指导着行动和互动，以及为什么从这些行动和互动原则出发，可以推导出社会结构（群体和集体）的生成不仅是可能的，而且是不可避免的。

我有三个基本观点。

第一，面对有价值资源，理性行动具有多方面的动机。其中至少有两个是基本的：损失最小化和收益最大化。虽然经验上相关，但是这些计算是独立的，前者比后者具有优先性（参见第四章）。

第二，这些计算和继承问题导致了资源转移的规则与首要群体（如家族）的优先性的形成。首要群体中的互动与集体行动，首先被维持和保护资源的情感所引导，其次被获得资源的需要所引导。

第三，一般而言，社会资本（嵌入在社会关系中的资源）的效用大大超过了个人与人力资本的效用。在有价值资源缺乏的情况下，这种估计推动了超越首要群体的互动的扩展。一旦这些关系与交换形成，特定的集体规则随之形成。这些规则超越了参与互动的行动者原来的意图与利益，成为社会结构形成的基础。

这一章上承第五章讨论的关于社会资本理论的行动与互动的一些基本命题，阐述首要群体的形成与重要性。然后，具体说明人力资本和社会资本的效用，社会资本的相对效用成为与首要群体以外的行动者互动和交换的动机。最后以对生成的社会结构的性质的进一步讨论为总结。这些探讨在本质上是推测性的，不免有些简略，不过这里的主要目的是提出主要论点和一组命题，为进一步详细述与评价作一个铺垫。

在我们开始讨论之前，先将问题定位在社会结构与行动理论的背景之内。

## 1.1 Sociological Theorizing

One way to categorize theorization in sociology is to capture how a theory specifies its causing and consequent concepts relative to two levels of society: structure and actors. If these two levels constitute a dichotomy, a simple typology may look like the one presented in Table 8.1. This typology identifies four types of theory. A macrotheory specifies both cause and effect concepts at the structural level, while a microtheory posits a relationship between them at the actor level. A structural theory links causal structural concepts to effectual actor-level concepts, and an action theory hypothesizes structural effects of actor-level concepts.

Table 8.1. A Typology of Sociological Theorization Based on Macro–Micro Specification

| Effectual Concept | Causal Concepts(Structure) | Causal Concepts(Actors) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structure | Macrotheory | Action theory |
| Actors | Structural theory | Microtheory |

This is a simplification, because it is possible to specify a more complex theory that involves cause or effect concepts at both structural and actor levels or concepts implicating more than two levels (e.g., individual actors, organizations, and society; see Hannan 1992). For example, a theory concerning an actor’s psychological well-being (an actor-level effect concept) may be specified as a consequence of both her or his network support (a structural-level concept) and her or her self-esteem (an actor-level concept) (see, e.g., Lin, Dean, and Ensel 1986). Likewise, a theory may concern the income level as a consequence of the education level (an actor-level concept), the nature of the firm (an organization-level concept), and the industrial sector (an economy or society-level concept) (see, e.g., Kalleberg and Lincoln 1988).

Given these precautions, the typology in Table 8.1 informs us of the fundamental theoretical process within which a particular theory positions itself. My sense is that of the four types, action theory is the most challenging and controversial. It is challenging because its causal concepts clearly intersect those primarily and usually identified as under the domains of other scientific disciplines: economics, psychology, or cultural anthropology. Rational choice theory, for example, extensively borrows the economic assumptions concerning optimization or maximization of choices relative to self-interest (Coleman 1990). Psychological and personality characteristics lay claim to concepts such as well-being , distress , and attitudes (see the discussion of shame in Elias 1939/1978 and that of emotion in Scheff 1992). Norms, values, and traditions can hardly be dissociated from collective and socialization experiences (Marini 1992).

An action theory does not wish to disown these potential sources of action (or spring of action , as Coleman 1990 calls it). It merely considers them as factors exogenous to the theory. The theory nevertheless needs to demonstrate that it involves more than a simple derivation from concepts already claimed theoretically by other disciplines.

Action theory is also controversial because its principal proposition concerning the causal linkage from action (the actor-level concept) to structure seems to suggest that the whole can be explained by its interacting parts. In general, trans-level causation is harder to demonstrate theoretically than same-level causation. Structural theory, however, has at least the advantage of the omnipresence of structure over actors. Thus, when it is claimed that an actor’s job-seeking behavior is dictated by the tightness of the labor market, it is hardly possible to place such actions outside the context of the labor market.2 Action theory, on the other hand, does not have this advantage because it is generally assumed that the structure is more than the sum of actions and interactions of actions (see the argument of structural or organizational robustness in Hannan 1992). Further, once a structure is in place, it becomes theoretically difficult to rule out the continuous interaction between structure and action.

An action theory faces the constant challenge to demonstrate whether and how effects of action remain when or after structural effects are taken into account. Abell (1992, p. 186) correctly points out that the primary puzzle for a rational choice theory is to demonstrate how

「interdependent individual actions produce system (or collective) level outcomes.」

社会学的理论说明

对社会学的理论进行分类的一个方法，是抓住一个理论如何阐述它相对于结构与行动者两个社会层次的因果概念。如果这两个层次构成了一个二分法，那么我们可以提出一个简单的类型学的划分，如表 8.1 所示。这个类型学的划分将理论确定为四种类型。宏观理论对原因与结果概念的说明都是在结构层次上，微观理论是把它们的关系定位在行动者的层次上。结构理论把作为原因的结构概念与作为结果的行动者层次上的概念连接起来，而行动理论假设行动者层次上的概念会推出结构概念。

表 8.1 建立在宏观-徽观说明基础上的社会学理论的类型学划分

| 结构概念 | 结构 | 行动者 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 结构 | 宏观理论 | 行动理论 |
| 行动者 | 结构理论 | 微观理论 |

1『又见二分法，2 个维度划分为四个区域。（2021-01-07）』

这是一个简化的分类，实际的情况更复杂。理论可能在结构与行动者层次上都涉及到原因和结果，或者涉及到更多的层次（如个体行动者、组织和社会；参见 Hannan, 1992）。例如，一个关于行动者心理健康的理论（一个行动者层次的结果概念），可以用她或他的网络支持（结构层次的概念）来说明，也可以用她或他的自尊（行动者层次的概念）来说明（可以参见 Lin, Dean, and Ensel, 1986）。同样地，一个理论可能用教育（行动者层次的概念）、公司的性质（组织层次的概念）和产业部门（经济或社会层次的概念来解释收人（可以参见 Kalleberg and Lincoln, 1988）。

应该注意，表 8.1 中的类型划分给我们提供的是用来定位某个理论的基本理论过程。在这四种类型中，我认为行动理论是最具有挑战性与争议性的。说它具有挑战性，是因为它的原因概念明显与主要为其他学科领域 一一 经济学、心理学或文化人类学 一一 所确定的原因概念相交叉。例如，理性选择理论被广泛应用经济学关于自我利益选择的最优化或最大化假定（Coleman, 1990）。心理学特征与人格特征的表述需要诸如健康、痛苦和态度的概念（see the discussion of shame in Elias 1939/1978 and that of emotion in Scheff 1992）。规范、价值和传统几乎不能与集体和社会化的经验相分离（Marini, 1992）。行动理论不想否认这些替在的行动诱因（sources of action; Coleman [1990] 也称为 spring of action）。它只是把它们作为理论的外生因素考虑。行动理论仍然需要证明，它所涉及的不是已经成为其他学科的理论概念的简单派生物。

行动理论也是具有争议性的，因为它关于从行动（行动者层次上的概念）到结构的因果联系的主要命题，似乎意味着整体可以被它互相作用的部分所解释。跨层次的因果关系通常比同一层次的因果关系更难从理论上证明。结构理论至少具有一个优势 一一 结构对于行动者而言是无所不在的。因此当承认行动者的求职行为受到劳动力市场的封闭性支配时，几乎不可能将这些行动置于劳动力市场的框架之外 [2]。而行动理论没有这个优势，因为通常认为结构大于行动与互动之和（参见 Hannan [1992] 关于结构或组织刚性「robustness」的观点）。而且结构一旦生成，不考虑结构与行动之间的连续互动在理论上是很难做到的。行动理论经常面临着挑战，要证明当考虑到结构的影响时，或者在考虑了结构的影响之后，行动的影响是否仍然存在以及如何发生作用。埃布尔（Abell, 1992 , p186）正确地指出，理性选择理论的主要难题是要证明「互相依赖的个人行动如何产生了系统（或集体）层次的结果」。

[2] 这不是争论或说明命题的有效性。

## 1.2 Principles of Action: Minimization of Loss and Maximization of Gain

The theory begins with two simple assumptions about motives for action: actions are primarily driven or motivated by the innate need for survival, and survival is seen as dependent upon the accumulation of valued resources. These assumptions regarding the motives (springs) for action require no further elaboration. What needs to be explored are the principles for action – choices and priority among choices. Again, for simplicity, I assume that action is driven by the desire to defend (maintain) resources or to seek (expand) resources.3 Action driven by resource defense is a calculation for minimizing resource loss (relative loss to cost).

Action driven by resource expansion, on the other hand, is a calculation for maximizing resource gain (relative gain to cost). Based on leads from previous sociological theories (the homophily principles and predomi-nance of expressive needs) and research evidence (see Marini 1992 for a review of evidence supporting the claim that in routine behavior, defending against loss may be a greater concern than seeking gain) regarding the relative significance of assessing losses and gains, I now propose that defending resources has higher priority than expanding resources. 4

Proposition 1: Defense and maintenance of resources is the ultimate motive for action. Thus, the first principle of action is a calculation of minimizing (resource) loss.

Proposition 2: Gaining and expanding resources is the next primary motive for action. Thus, the second principle of action is a calculation of maximizing (resource) gain.

These propositions present two important arguments. First, minimization of loss and maximization of gain are two different functions rather than inverse functions of each other.5 They may involve different choices (what kind and how much of a resource) and therefore different preferences. Second, they form a ranked action set rather than a dichotomy. A series of actions may manifest two motives: minimizing loss and maximizing gain. Given the opportunity, actions are taken to fulfill both motives. However, when the actor must make a choice, preference is given to maintaining resources: the higher priority is given to the calculation that minimizes loss.

2 This is not to argue for or claim the proposition’s validity.

3 This assumption is consistent with the purposive action approach.

4 This is valid only if the actor has some resources to begin with.

行动的原则：损失最小化和收益最大化

行动理论以关于行动动机的两个假定为起点：行动主要为生存的固有需要所驱动或激发；生存依赖于有价值资源的积累。这些关于行动动机的假定不需要进一步阐述。需要探讨的是行动的原则选择与选择的优先性。此外，简单地讲，我假定行动为保护（维持）资源或寻找（扩展）资源的欲望所驱动 [3]。为资源保护所驱动的行动是一个使资源损失（相对于成本的损失）最小化的计算。

另一方面，为资源扩展所驱动的行动则是一个使资源收益（相对于成本的收益）最大化的计算。建立在先前有关确定损失与收益的相对重要性的社会学理论（同质原则与表达性需要的支配）和研究证明（参见 Marini [1992] 对支持观点在例行化的行为中，「防止丧失的保护」可能比「寻找收益」受到更大的关的证据的回顾）的基础上，我现在提出保护资源比扩展资源具有更高的优先性。[4]

命题 1：保护与维持资源是行动的首要动机。因此行动的第一原则是使（资源）损失最小化。

命题 2：获得与扩展资源是第二重要的行动动机。因此，行动的第二个原则是使（资源）收益最大化。

这些命题提出了两个重要观点。

第一，损失最小化与收益最大化是两个不同的函数，而不是互为反函数。它们可能涉及到不同的选择（什么类型的资源和多少资源）与不同的偏好。

第二，它们形成了ー个行动序列，而不是一个二元体。但是一连串的行动最终可能表现为两个动机：损失最小化与收益最大化。如果有机会，行动者会在采取行动同时实现这两个目的。但是当必须作一个选择的时侯，行动者偏向于维持资源：更优先考虑的是使损失最小化。

[3] 这个假定与目的性行动的假定是一致的。

[4] 只有当行动者最初有一些资料时，这个命题才有效。

## 1.3 Recognition and Profit: Principles of Interaction 

How would these two action principles implicate interactions? They would, first of all, suggest that interactions are engaged primarily for minimizing resource loss and secondarily for maximizing gain. An interaction following the principle of loss minimization strives to defend loss of resources to another actor. The best possible outcome is that there is no loss. If both actors employ the minimization principle, one local equilibrium is that both actors accept the no-loss outcome for both actors.

In social terminology, this outcome is a mutual recognition of each other’s claim to their respective resources – property rights.6 Recognition therefore is a cost to each actor in that ego abandons any challenge to the alter’s sovereignty over its resources.7 It is a minimal cost.

This is a local equilibrium, because it is very constrained. First, it assumes that only two actors engage in the interaction. When multiple actors (three or more) are engaged, a coalition is likely to result and the local equilibrium becomes increasingly difficult to maintain. Second, it is seldom the case that the two actors bring equal resources to bear in the interaction. Thus, recognition itself becomes a variable rather than 5 Empirically, they may be negatively correlated.

a constant. That is, recognition may occur with unequal costs to the two parties. One actor may be willing to give more recognition to the alter in that ego not only disclaims the alter’s sovereignty over resources, but also commits itself to come to the defense of the alter, should its sovereignty be challenged in interactions with other actors. Or recognition may be maintained only after an actor has also agreed to give up some resources to the alter. Thus, at a minimum, there are two types of recognition. In the first instance, where mutual recognition is achieved with minimal cost to each actor (Pizzorno 1991), we may consider the recognition as approval or social approval (Lindenberg 1992). In the second instance, recognition implicates legitimation – certain generally accepted rules for responsive actions to ensure recognition. Third, seldom do actors use the pure minimization principle in a series of actions. Recognition may be a temporary outcome – until one or more actors proceed to evoke the principle of maximization of gain.

Thus, in realistic situations, recognition usually comes as an outcome with unequal costs to parties, an issue I will address in more detail in the next chapter. Nevertheless, I argue that it is the fundamental principle for interactions, for it guarantees the minimal survival of an actor and is consistent with the first principle of action (Proposition 1).

Proposition 3: Interaction, following the minimization principle of action, seeks recognition of one’s claim to resources.

The element of recognition, I argue, is consistent with some concepts acknowledged or developed by several rational choice theorists (Pizzorno 1991; Lindenberg 1992). What is made explicit here is that recognition in interactions can be understood when action is motivated by the principle of minimization of loss rather than maximization of gain.

I will skip further discussion of interactions based on the principle of maximization of gain, for they would merely reflect the usual economic calculations as developed extensively in the literature. What needs to be studied at this point is how these principles of action and interaction offer clues to the emergence of social structure.

6 Trust may be an alternative term. However, I believe recognition may be evoked without trust, which has a stronger affective meaning. See Chapter 9 for further discussion of recognition.

7 Note that this would be considered a mere stalemate or a worst outcome if the principle of maximization is evoked.

认可与获利：互动的原则

这两个行动原则如何与互动联系在一起？首先，它们意味着参与互动首先是为了使资源损失最小化，其次是使收益最大化。遵循损失最小化原则的互动会尽力防止资源损失给对方。最好的结果是没有损失。如果两个行动者都使用最小化原则，形成的局部均衡是两个行动者都接受对方不损失的结果。用社会学的术语，这个结果是对彼此的资源所有权 一一 产权的相互认可。[6] 认可对于每一个行动者都会产生成本，因为自我要放弃对他人的资源占有的挑战。[7] 但这是一个最小的成本。

这是一个局部均衡，因为它要受到很多约束。第一，假定只有两个行动者参与互动。当多个行动者（三个或更多）参与的时候，可能会产生联合，局部均衡将变得越来越难维持。第二，很少出现两个行动者在互动中使用的资源相等的情兄。因此，认可本身成为变量而不是常量。也就是说，认可可能发生在付出不等成本的双方。一个行动者可能愿意给予他人更多的认可，这个行动者不仅放弃挑战他人对资源的主权，而且如果他人的主权在互动中被其他行动者所挑战，这个行动者还会挺身而出为他辩护。另一种情况是，当一个行动者同意放弃一些资原给他人之后，可才能维持。因此，至少存在两种类型的人认可。

首先，当每一个行动者都以最小的成本实现相互认可时（Pizzorno 1991），我们可以将之称为赞同或社会赞同（Lindenberg 1992）。其次，认可涉及到合法性 一一 为保证认可，回应性的行动通常所接受的某种规则。再次，在一连串的行动中，行动者很少使用纯粹的最小化原则。认可可能是一个暂时性的结果 —— 到一个或更多的行动者开始使用收益最大化原则结束。

因此，在现实的情兄下，可通常是互动双方付出不平等成本的结果。我将在下一章中更具体地寸论这个问题。然而，我认为它是互动的基本原则，因为它保证了行动者最低限度的生存条件，与行动的第一原则是一致的（命题 1）。

命题 3：遵循行动的最小化原则的互动，是为了寻求对资源权利的认可。

我认为认可的因素与几位理性选择理论家所接受或阐发的一些概念是一致的（Pizzorno, 1991; Lindenberg, 1992）。这里很清楚的是，当行动被损失最小化而不是收益最大化原则所激发的时候，互动中认可的发生是可以理解的。

我将跳过对建立在收益最大化原则基础上的互动的深入讨论，因为它们们只是反映了文献中已经被广为阐发的经济计算。现在需要研究的是，这些行动与互动的原则如何提供了理解社会结构生成的线索。

[5] 根据经验，它们可能负相关。

[6] 信任的意思与之相近。但是，我认为没有信任也可以产生认可，信任有更强的感情含义。参见第九章对认可的进一步讨论。

[7] 注意，如果使用的是最大化原则，将要考虑到低局或更坏的结果。

## 1.4 Succession and Transfer of Resources: The Primacy of the Primordial Group

Human actions are further compounded by additional innate but prominent life circumstances: finality of life and reproductivity of life. Survival of an individual actor is limited in time. One possible consequence of an actor’s exit might be that all resources associated with the actor revert back to a pool for other actors to compete for. However, this strategy

would mean a total loss of resources to the actor after lifelong efforts (actions and interactions) to maintain and expand them.

Alternatively, the resources may be transferred to another actor(s). An extension of the primacy of the principle of minimization of loss (Proposition 1) suggests that the actor prefers to transfer claimed resources to another actor deemed most suitable as a surrogate. Suitability is reflected in the extent to which the surrogate is easily identified with the actor in continued recognition and legitimation relative to other actors. Reproductivity of life, in most societies, offers an easy rule to identify the surrogate. Thus, for most societies, the primordial group, the family, becomes the immediate and natural extension of the actor.8

The primacy of the primordial group for succession and transfer of resources further incorporates noneconomic considerations into actions.

Restriction of succession within a primordial group reduces the range of the surrogate’s choices. Depending on the rules of succession, the choice may be reduced to zero degree (e.g., the oldest son as the successor).

Thus, recognition and legitimation considerations are given increasing priority over competence and skills that are useful in maximizing gains

– the economic calculation. It is clear that the existence of the primordial group, as it prevails throughout human history, makes any theory based on economic calculations alone unattainable.

This last conclusion does not lead to another conclusion: that actions are not rational. If rationality is defined as the process of reasoning by way of calculation over choices, then it is clear, as argued earlier, that recognition and profit provide rational bases for interaction choices.

资源的继承与转移：首要群体的优先性

人类行动还受到固有的、突出的生命条件的影响：生命的终结与生命的繁衍。一个个体行动者的生存时间是有限的。行动者死亡的一个可能的结果是所有与他相联系的资源可能要返还成为行动者所竞争的共用物。但是，这种情况意味着行动者毕生维持与扩展资源的努力（行动与互动）要全部白费。

另一种情况是，资源可以转移给另一个（些）行动者。损失最小化原贝（命题 1）的优先性的扩展意味着，行动者喜欢把资源转移给自认岁是最合适的替代者的另一个行动者。「适当性」反映了替代者相对于其他行动者在后续的认可与合法性中容易被确认的程度。在大多数社会中，生命的繁衍提供了确认替代者的简单规则。因此，对于大多数社会，首要群体与家庭成为行动者直接的、自然的延伸。[8]

2『首要群体，可以做一张术语卡片。（2021-01-07）』——未完成

首要群体在资源的继承与转移上的优先性进一步将对非经济因素的考虑加入到行动中来。继承约束在首要群体之内，降低了替代者选择的范围。依靠继承规则，选择可以减少到零（如最大的儿子是继承者）。因此，认可与合法性的考虑逐渐赢得了对收益最大化的能力和技能 —— 经济计算 一一 考虑相对的优势。盛行于整个人类历史上的首要群体的存在，使我们找不到任何仅仅建立在经济计算基础上的理论。

上面的结论不能推导出行动不是理性的。如果将理性定义为通过对选择进行计算的方式来推理的过程，那么很显然，前面所论述的认可与获利提供了互动选择的理性基础。

[8] 我在其他地方（Lin, 1989）讨论了资源转移的规则和类型。家庭的资源转移规则是存在差异的。例如，继承规则在各社会中是不同的，尽管存在着很强的男性优先的倾向，但是不存在统一的继承制度，有的社会是长子继承制，有的社会是诸子均分制。最有趣的案例是，中国传统社会使用分化的规则：在权威继承上是长子继承制但是在财产继承上却是诸子均分制。由此引致的冲突和混乱以及资源积累的减少，是任何经济原则所不能解释的。家庭群体（在大多数系统中是占主导地位的首要群体）不是惟一的群体。首要群体可能建立在其他基础之上（如种族、宗教和性别身份）。但是这些差异并不影响本章后面的观点。

## 1.5 Human Capital, Social Capital, and Social Network 

The need to minimize loss and maximize gain establishes two building blocks to understand interactions beyond the primordial group. However, we need to introduce another building block: consideration of 8 Elsewhere (Lin 1989), I discuss rules of transfer and types of resources transferred. There are variations in transfer rules within the context of family. For example, inheritance rules vary across societies, and there is no uniformity regarding unigeniture, primogeniture, or even-distribution principles, even though there seems to be a strong tendency toward male primacy. In the most interesting case, the Chinese traditional system uses split rules: primogeniture for authority inheritance but even distribution among sons for property inheritance. The resulting conflict and chaos, as well as the diminishing pooled resources, cannot be explained by any economic principles. Nor is the family group (pre-dominantly the primordial group in most systems) the only primordial group. A primordial group can be and has been constructed on other bases (e.g., ethnic, religious, and gender identities). These variations, however, do not affect subsequent arguments in the chapter.

the relative utility of two kinds of resources, human capital and social capital.

Human capital is resources in the possession of the actor who can make decisions (exercise authority) about their usage and disposition.

These possessed goods can also be transferred to designated successors as the actor sees fit. Social capital is resources attached to other actors.

Interactions and relations with other actors offer the possibility that such resources can be borrowed for ego’s purposes. In return, the borrowed resources must be returned, replaced, or reciprocated. In the most primitive terms, borrowing a neighbor’s cutting instruments during a harvest is one example of access to and use of social capital. Once the harvest is over, the instruments are returned (either intact or replaced) to the neighbor. More important, the expectation is that the neighbor may borrow ego’s resources, such as his son, to help him harvest as well.

Because of the constraints attached to the use of social capital, as well as the energy and resources required to maintain relations and reciprocal transactions, sentiment dictates a preference for the accumulation of personal capital rather than social capital. That is, the relative cost (tem-porality in use, obligation for return or replacement, and commitment for reciprocity) for using human capital is much lower than that for using social capital. How do we account, then, for the use of social capital and therefore the maintenance of social relations? That, of course, is the critical and pivotal issue in any theory linking actions to structure.

The pinnacle argument, for me, rests with two central theoretical propositions:

Proposition 4: The accumulation of social capital is much faster than that of human capital . That is, accumulation of human capital tends to be additive in nature, whereas accumulation of social capital tends to be exponential .

Proposition 5: When interactions outside of one’s primordial group are intended to gain resources, they are used more for accessing social capital than gaining human capital .

Human capital is accumulated by actions taken by the actor and members of his or her primordial group. Each action generates a given amount of additional resources. Therefore, there is a tendency to expand the primordial group (e.g., the extended family) so that the generation and accumulation of resources can accelerate.

Social capital, on the other hand, is generated by creating and maintaining social ties. A relation with a social tie suggests a linkage and therefore access to the tie’s resources: social capital for ego. Further, once a tie is accessed, not only do his or her resources become social capital to ego, but the alter’s social ties also offer possible social capital. Con-

Figure 8.1 Accumulation rates for human and social capital.

ceivably, social capital might be accessible through ego’s network of direct and indirect ties. The extent of access to such social capital, of course, depends on how much resources are at the disposal of the social ties, as well as on the nature and extent of the ties. As these ties extend into a network of both direct and indirect ties, the pool of social capital grows exponentially. Thus, by using the networking principle, the potential pool of social capital becomes extended quickly. The hypothesized rates are depicted in Figure 8.1.

Further considerations need to be taken into account in developing possible models of exponential accumulation of social capital. The free rendition in Figure 8.1 is entirely conjectural. The slope of the S-shaped curve is based on the assumption that interactions and networking extend slowly at first, probably among a small number of actors with similar resources, and then quickly, to larger numbers of actors with dissimilar and better resources as the network extends through indirect ties.

It plateaus and reaches an upper limit, because the function must be constrained by an efficiency factor (it may be a function of the number of intermediary links, associated negatively with recognition and legitimation and positively with the cost or multiplicity of reciprocal obligations).

While the relative cost of accumulating and using social capital is high, there are conditions in which such cost is more than compensated for and exceeded by the relative advantage in the speed of accumulating social capital. The calculation tipping in favor of social capital approaches inevitability for most actors due to the likelihood of two limiting conditions for the accumulation of human capital: the ultimate limiting size of the primordial group and the scarcity of materials for resources.

As mentioned earlier, one way to speed up the accumulation of human capital is to expand the primordial group, whose membership shares the interest in resource production and transfers. However, as the size of the primordial group increases, it also creates problems for the maintenance of centralized authority over resources and competition for the succession to resource entitlement. To maintain the primordial group’s expansion, more and more resources must be generated so that there is sufficient sharing among members. So long as there are plenty of raw materials for resource production, the primordial group’s expansion can continue.

However, it is inevitable that multiple groups seeking resources increase in size to the point where they have to compete for materials.

Competition for scarce materials can be and is ended at a primitive level by one group taking physical possession of other primordial groups and turning the members of these groups into resource-generating instruments – enslaved laborers. However, unless the ability to take possession of another group is overwhelming in terms of relative size or superiority of instruments (technology), there is always a risk that the confrontation will result in the enslavement of ego’s group instead.

An alternative to enslavement in the face of material scarcity is access to and use of social capital, even though such use, as discussed, incurs a greater cost than the use of human capital. Once such a rational decision is made, interactions with actors beyond one’s primordial group not only take place, they are actively sought for their access to social capital.

Such access is also entirely consistent with the motives for actions (minimizing loss and maximizing gain) and the principles of interactions (recognition and profit). Social capital can be mobilized to accomplish both purposes.

人力资本、社会资本与社会网络

损失最小化与收益最大化的需要建立了理解超出首要群体的互动的两块基石。然而，我们需要引进另一块基石：人力资本和社会资本两种类型的资源的相对效用。

人力资本是对资源的使用与处理作出决策（行使权威）的行动者所拥有的资源。如果行动者认为合适，这些拥有的物品也可以转移给指定的继承者。社会资本是与其他行动者相联系的资源。与其他行动者的互动和关系提供了借用这些资源来实现自我利益的可能性。作为报答，借用的资源必须归还、赔还或酬还。在收获季节借用邻居的收割工具是获取和使用社会资本的一个最简单的例子。一旦收割结束，工具（完好的或赔还的）要归还给邻居。更重要的是，邻居希望也可以借用你的资源，例如让你的儿子帮助他收割。

因为使用社会资本有很多约束，而且维持关系与互惠交易也需要精力和资源，所以情感决定了更喜欢积累个人资本而不是社会资本的偏好。也即，使用社会资本的相对成本（使用的暂时性，归还或赔还的义务，以及互惠的承诺）比人力资本要高的多。那么我们如何解释社会资本的使用与社会关系的维持？这自然是任何一个将行动与结构联系起来的理论所要解决的重要问题。

在这里我最重要的观点是两个中心理论命题。

命题 4：社会资本的积累速度比人力资本要快得多。也即，人力资本的积累呈算术速度增长，而社会资本的积累呈指数速度长。

命题 5：当首要群体之外的互动试图获得资源时，它们更多被用来获取社会资本而不是人力资本。

人力资本是通过行动者与他或她的首要群体的成员的行动来积累的。每行动都产生了一定数量的附加资源。因此，为了加速资源的生产和积累存在着扩大首要群体（如扩展家庭）的需要。

而社会资本是通过发展和维持社会关系产生的。有社会联系的关系意味着与关系资源的联系和接触 —— 你的社会资本。而且一旦建立关系，不仅他或她的资源成为你的社会资本，而且他或她的社会关系也可能提供社会资本。很容易想到，社会资本可以通过自我的直接和间接的关系网络来获取。这些社会资本的获取范围，自然取决于你可以支配的资源数量，你的社会关系以及关系的性质与范围。当这些关系扩展成为包括直接和间接关系的网络时，社会资本的积累会呈指数增长。因此，通过使用网络运作的原则，社会资本的潜在积累会迅速扩大。对人力资本与社会资本的积累速度所做的假设，如图 8.1 所示。

![](./res/2021015.png)

图 8.1 人力资本与社会资本的积累速度

需要进一步考虑的是，发展社会资本的指数积累模型。图 8.1 的形状完全可以推测出来。S 型曲线的斜度是建立在互动假定的基础之上的 —— 互动与网络运行可能先在数量很少的有相似资源的行动者中缓慢地扩展，然后当通过间接关系扩大网络时，它们迅速地在很多拥有非相似性与较好资源的行动者中扩展开来。曲线会到达一个上限和稳定的水平，因为函数必定受到有效因子（它可能是中间联系的数量的函数，与认可和合法化负相关，与互惠义务的成本或多重性正相关）的限制。

虽然积累和使用社会资本的相对成本很高，但是这些成本会得到更多的补偿，并且会被社会资本的积累速度上的相对优势所超越。对于大多数行动者来说，由于人力资本的积累可能存在着两个约束条件 一一 首要群体最终的规模约束与产生资源的物质的缺乏，几乎必然会出现支持社会资本的计算结果。

前面已经提到，加速人力资本积累的一个方法是扩大首要群体，首要群体的成员身份可以在资源生产和转移中分享利益。但是随着首要群体规模的扩大，会产生中心权威对资源与资源继承权竞争的维持问题。为了支持首要群体的扩大，必须生产越来越多的资源，这样才能保证成员能够得到足够的分配。只要资源生产的原材料充足，首要群体的扩大就可以继续。

然而，寻求资源的各个群体的规模必然会增大到不得不互相竟争的时刻。对稀缺资源的竞争可能在一个原始的水平上结束 —— 一个群体从人身上占有其他首要群体，将这些群体的成员变成资源生产的工具（被奴役的劳动者）。但是，除非占有另一个群体的群体在相对规模或工具（技术）优势上是压倒性的，否则总是存在着对抗，奴役群体有反过来被奴役的风险。

面对着物质缺乏，代替被奴役的另一个选择是获取和使用社会资本，尽管这比使用人力资本会产生更大的成本。人们一旦作出这样一个理性的决策，就会与超越首要群体的行动者发生互动，而且会在互动中积极地获取社会资本。这些获取也是与行动动机（损失最小化和收益最大化）和互动原则（认可和获利）完全一致的。因为动员社会资本就是为了实现这两个目的。

## 1.6 The Emergence of Structure

Such access comes at an important cost – willingness and preparedness to reciprocate in terms of recognition and profit. There must be a commitment to provide one’s own resources as social capital to others. To ensure stable access to social capital and to demonstrate reciprocity, interactions are routinized – that is, social relations are formed. The maintenance of social relations is likewise based on the two rational principles specified in Propositions 1 and 2. Social capital is used primarily and is relied on to maintain, sustain, and defend one’s resources. It is used secondarily to gain additional resources. Legitimation guides reciprocity and the calculation process. The calculation is complicated by the fact that routinized social relations directly and indirectly involve

multiple actors and their primordial (and extended) groups. While such relations promote access to social capital, recognition and legitimation of relations and obligations quickly increase the complexity of calculations. That is, sharing social capital and an increasing need for legitimation rules go hand in hand. In subsequent actions, an actor’s calculation must take into account whether the action is consistent with the obligation to defend and/or expand the resources of the interacting actors.

The multiplicity and complexity of routinized social relations demand increasing rules of recognition and legitimation. These rules recognize the basic right to human capital (property) and, at the same time, specify responsibilities and obligations for actors in the interacting network to contribute resources. Recognition, in fact, is an important way to overcome a possible cost of unequal exchanges – why someone in a higher social position and with richer resources would be engaged in repeated exchanges with someone in a lower social position and with poorer resources. I will elaborate on this function further in the next chapter.

结构的生成

这些获取伴随着高成本 一一 愿意和准备在认可与获利上进行互惠交换。而且必定要作出承诺：自己的资源可以作为他人的社会资本来使用。为了确保稳定地获取社会资本和显示互惠性、互动被例行化了 一一 也即社会关系形成了。社会关系的维持也是建立在命题 1 和命题 2 所阐述的两个理性原则的基础之上。社会资本主要用来维持和保护资源。获得额外资源只是基于第二位的考虑。例行化的社会关系直接或间接地涉及到多个行动者以及他们的首要（和扩展）群体，这使得计算变得复杂起来。当这些关系促进了对社会资本的获取时，对关系和义务的认可与合法化也迅速提高了计算的复杂性。也即，社会资本的共享与对合法化规则的需要的增加是一致的。在随后的行动中，一个行动者的计算必须要考虑行动是否与保护和 / 或扩展参与互动的行动者的资源的义务相一致。

例行化的社会关系的多重性和复杂性需要增加认可与合法化的规则。这些规则承认人力资本（产权）的基本权利，同时明确指出生了在互动网络中提供资源的行动者的责任与义务。事实上，认可是克服不平等交换的可能成本的一个重要方法。为什么在较高社会位置上和资源丰富的人会反复地与处于较低社会位置上和资源贫乏的人互动？我将在下一章中阐述这个功能。

## 1.7 Collectivity and Public Capital

Once such social relations and sharing of resources are established and maintained, a collectivity is formed. A collectivity is an aggregation of actors and primordial groups bound together for the sharing of social capital. A collectivity can also decide to produce further resources that belong to the collectivity rather than to specific actors – the public capital . The persistence of a collectivity depends on a set of formal and informal rules governing actors relative to each other and to the access and use of shared resources. These rules establish differential obligations and rewards for member actors.

Differential obligations are necessary because the collectivity’s continued existence depends on the maintenance and gain of shared resources.

Obligations include two types: (1) recognition and loyalty (sentiment) to the collectivity and its rules and (2) amount and type of performance (work) in the production of shared resources, especially public capital.

The loyalty factor minimizes the loss of public capital, and the performance requirement maximizes the gain of such resources. Differential rewards are necessary because actors are evaluated as differentially fulfilling their obligations to the collectivity. Thus, more rewards are given to those who demonstrate a high degree of loyalty and/or a high level of performance. Rewards can be symbolic as well as material. Material rewards include the designation and allocation of resources to the actor-occupants (the gaining of human capital) and the authority to access and

use shared resources (public capital). Symbolic rewards include public commendation of the actor-occupant and assurance of the transfer of such honors to the actor’s future generations. Another increasingly important reward system concerns rules and procedures for allocating enforcing agent positions in the collectivity. This will be discussed further.

These obligations and rewards, while required for the continued existence of a collectivity, both complement and compete with the primitive obligations actors have for themselves and their primordial groups. They are complementary because the shared resources in the collectivity supplement human capital, so that shortage of human capital no longer need always be a threat to survival. They are competitive because energy allocation for resource production and loyalty commitments can be taxing.

There is the inevitable conflict of interest, however. Since primitive motives drive the actors to maintain and gain human capital rather than public capital, willingness to perform and be loyal to the collectivity and collective goods depends on at least two important factors: (1) how important the public capital is to the actors and (2) how collective obligations and rewards, in terms of loyalty and performance, synchronize with primary obligations and rewards. The more positive the two evaluations, the more likely the actors will be willing to perform and be loyal to the collectivity and the collective goods. In the extreme situation, an actor may be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, his or her own life, in order to preserve shared resources for the primordial group and the collectivity.

If the two factors are not seen as matched, two outcomes are likely.

The actor may choose to leave the collectivity, at the risk of losing public capital but in the hope of finding another collectivity better matched to the interest of ego and his or her primordial group. Alternatively, there is an increasing likelihood that the actor will become a free rider, who takes and treats shared resources as human capital. There are, of course, risks associated with both of these choices. Leaving increases the problem of protecting oneself and finding resources for survival. Free riders may run the risk of punishment (deprivation of human and public capital) established by the collectivity, which will be discussed later.

As the size of the collectivity increases, interactions become fragmented (localization of networks) and shared resources become segmented (localization based on shared resources and characteristics). At the collective level, obligations and rewards must be continuously revised to cover the increasing number of actors and their need for public capital.

As a result, the proportion of collective obligations and responsibility overlapping with individual actors and their primordial groups decreases. Routinized recognition and legitimation will decrease in their utility to bind actors to the collectivity.

集体与公共资本

一旦这些社会关系与资源的共享被确立和维持，集体也就形成了。集体是共享社会资本的行动者与首要群体的集合体。集体可以决定生产属于集体而不是某一行动者的资源公共资本。集体的延续依赖于一套正式与非正式的规则，来规范行动者之间的互动以及行动者对共享资源的获取与使用。这些规则为成员行动者确立了有差别的义务与报酬。

有差别的义务是必需的，因为集体的持续存在依赖于对共享资源的维持与获取。义务分为两种类型：1）对集体及其规则的认可与忠诚（情感）。2）在共享资源，特别是公共资本的生产中的绩效（工作）的数量和类型。

忠诚因素使公共资本的损失最小化，而绩效要求使这些资源的收益最大化。有差别的报酬也是必需的，因为行动者对集体履行的义务是有差别的。通常将更多的报酬给予那些表现出高度的忠诚和 / 或高水平的绩效的成员。报酬可以是符号的，也可以是物质的。物质报酬包括分配给行动 —— 占据者（actor-occupants）的资源（人力资本的收益）以及获取与使用共享资源的权威（公共资本）。符号报酬包括对行动 —— 占据者的公开表扬，并保证将这些荣誉转移给行动者的后代。另一个日渐重要的报酬体系涉及到分配集体中的代理位置的规则和程序。这还会被进一步讨论。

这些义务与报酬是集体的持续存在所需要的，它们都是行动者对他们自己与其首要群体的原始义务的补充，它们也与后者形成竞争关系。这二者是互补性的，因为集体中的共享资源补充了人力资本，人力资本的缺乏不再成为生存的威胁。这二者又是竞争性的，因为资源生产的精力分配与忠诚承诺能非常繁重。

利益冲突也是不可避免的，因为原始动机驱动着行动者维持和获得人力资本而不是公共资本。愿意履行集体的规则并忠诚于集体至少依赖于两个重要的因素：1）公共资本对于行动者的重要程度；2）集体义务和报酬在忠诚和绩效方面如何与原始的义务和报酬相协调。这两个估算越积极，行动者越可能愿意履行集体的规则并忠诚于集体。在极端情况下，为了保护首要群体与集体的共享资源，一个行动者可能愿意作出最大的牺牲 —— 他或她自己的生命。

如果这两个因素不匹配，可能出现两个结果。行动者可能冒着丧失公共资本的风险，选择离开集体，但是希望能够再找到一个与自我和首要群体的利益相匹配的更好的集体。另一种情况是，行动者很可能成为搭便车者，把共享资源当作人力资本。这两个选择当然都有风险。选择「离开」会产生保护自己与寻找生存资源的问题。搭便车者可能冒着被集体惩罚的风险（剥夺人力资本与公共资本），在后面还会讨论到这个问题。

随着集体规模的扩大，互动变得分裂化（网络的地方化），共享资源变得分割化（建立在共享资源与共享特征基础上的地方化）。在集体层次上必须不断对义务与报酬的规定加以修改，以涵盖不断增加的行动者以及他们对公共资本的需求。其结果是，集体与个体行动者同它们的首要群体相重叠的那部分义务与责任的比例下降了。例行化的认可和合法化密切行动者与集体之间关系的功用降低了。

## 1.8 Social Contracts

To ensure that collective obligations and rewards are perceived as matched with those of member actors, structural problems of fragmentation and segmentation are overcome, loyalty and performance are exercised, and exits and free rides are minimized, a collectivity can develop and employ three strategies: (1) cultivate actors through education and acculturation to internalize collective obligations and rewards (Bourdieu and Passeron 1977; Marini 1992); (2) engage in mass campaigns promoting the identification of the actors with the attractiveness of shared resources and the collectivity (Putnam 1993); and (3) develop and enforce rules for forced compliance . Kelman’s (1961) discussion of the three processes (internalization, identification, and compliance) implies that these strategies form points along two axes. Compliance can be achieved with maximal speed but a minimal span of effect. When control is present, compliance is quickly achieved (e.g., war prisoner’s behaviors). But when it is absent or lifted, such behaviors will also quickly change or disappear. Internalization, on the other hand, takes the longest time to achieve, but the consequent behaviors presumably persist with minimal control. Discussion of the employment of these strategies is beyond the scope of this chapter. What needs to be emphasized is that each of these strategies entails the development of rules of engagement for actors in the collectivity. Further, agents and agencies of enforcement must be developed.

These enforcing actors are used to administer and manage activities as well as enforce the collectivity’s rules. They are rewarded according to the evaluation of their performance. The emergence and necessity of these enforcing agents generates further relationships between actors and the collectivity. These agents assume authority over individual resources and act on the collectivity’s behalf. While they are expected to defend and expand individual actors’ resources as well, their ultimate rewards come from demonstrating loyalty to the collectivity and to public capital expansion.

As scarcity of resources increases and the collectivity grows in size, the enforcing agents gain prominence among members, as the collectivity’s survival increasingly depends on the agents’ enforcement of rules. One important means of integrating actors, shared resources, and rules is to specify positions (corporal actors) with defined roles relative to types and amounts of resources; to execute the rules; and to designate actors as occupants of the positions. Thus, a hierarchy among actors will emerge not only because of differential obligations and rewards, but also because of differential allocation and the opportunity to be enforcing agents.

These obligations, rewards, and opportunities form the basis of agency relative to the positions they occupy.

社会契约

为了让集体成员感到集体的义务和报酬与成员的义务和报酬是一致的，为了克服分裂化与分割化的结构问题，为了使忠诚与绩效起作用，为了使退出者与搭便车者降到最低水平，集体可以采用三种策略：1）通过教育和濡化来教化行动者，使它们内化集体的义务与报酬（Bourdieu and Passeron, 1997; Marini, 1992）。2）参与大众运动，促进行动者对共享资源与集体的认同（Putnam, 1993）。3）发展和实施强迫性顺从的规则。

凯尔曼（kelman, 1961）在对这三个过程（内化、认同和顺从）的讨论中指出，这些策略形成了具有两个轴线方向的点。顺从可以以最快的速度实现，但是起作用的时间最短。当控制存在的时候，顺从会迅速发生（如战俘的行为）。但是当控制不在场或消失的时侯，这些行为也将迅速改变或消失。内化完全是另一种情况，需要最长的时间来实现，但是随后行为的持续可能需要最少的控制。对这些策略使用的讨论超出了本书的范围。需要强调的是，对于集体中的行动者而言，每一种策略都需要制定参与规则。此外，必须设立实施规则的代理人与机构。

这些代理人被用来规范成员的行为与执行集体的规则，集体根据他们的业绩来奖赏他们。这些执行代理人的出现深化了行动者与集体之间的关系。这些代理人对个人资源具有管辖权，并代表集体的利益行动。虽然他们也被期望着保护和扩展个体行动者的资源，但是他们最终的报酬来自对集体与公共资本扩展的忠诚的证明。

随着资源缺乏的威胁的增加与集体规模的扩大，执行代理人在成员中的地位变得越发突出，因为集体的生存越来越依赖于代理人对规则的执行上整合行动者、共享资源和规则的一个重要方法是，将职位（法人行动者）专门化，根据资源的类型和数量定义角色；执行规则；将行动者指派为职位的占据者。因此，行动者中的等级制的出现，不仅因为有差别的义务和报酬，而且因为成为执行代理人的机会与分配的执行代理人的职位不同。这些义务、报酬和机会组成了与占据的位置相对应的行动基础。

## 1.9 Sources of Tension in Social Systems

Space does not permit further elaboration of the relationships between corporal (enforcing) actors and natural actors, the formalization of legitimation and profit rules in the realized social system, and the perpetual tension between loyalty and profit for a social system and its individual and corporal actors. However, I can point out several sources of tension in social systems that can develop. The most obvious one is the tension between human capital and public capital. Because of the ultimate survival instinct and the cost of accessing public capital, there is a much stronger tendency for a natural person to strive for human capital. A social system needs to strike a balance between providing opportunities for the participants to maintain and gain reasonable amounts of human capital and enforcing their willingness to produce and maintain public capital.

A second source of tension is the balance between mobility and solidarity. Mobility represents the opportunity to move up in the social hierarchy, whereas solidarity is the need to share sentiment and legitimacy with regard to other participants’ interests and resources.9 Mobility encourages actors to break away from their social circle of shared interests and resources in order to gain more or better resources in the social system. Solidarity relies on identification with others who share similar 9 I define solidarity as the degree of sentiment and legitimacy regarding one another’s resources, as expressed by a collectivity’s actors. This conception is somewhat similar to Hechter’s (1983) conceptualization. Hechter, using a rational-choice perspective, suggests that the solidarity of a group become possible when two elements are present: (a) dependence relations between individuals and the group, as determined by access to alternative sources for resources, and (b) a monitoring capacity of the group in terms of both monitoring individuals’ behaviors and sanctioning behaviors via leadership. Thus, Hechter’s work can be seen as an attempt to specify further the interactions linking individuals to obligations and reciprocity and thereby to various market, authority, and norms systems that Coleman (1986a, 1986b) suggested but never specified. The first element identified by Hechter is a direct application of the dependence-power theory advanced by Emerson and Cook (Emerson 1962; Cook, Emerson, Gillmore, and Yamagishi 1983; Yamagishi, Gillmore, and Cook 1988). It emphasizes the significance of networking among individuals and issues of resources deemed valuable to individuals. It can follow from the basic argument of individuals seeking maximal resources through interactions with multiple actors. However, this resource-dependence or power argument, I would argue, is not a necessary condition for solidarity, which for me reflects more a mutual sentiment and thus a predisposition among members to reinforce and defend one another or shared resources. The second element, the monitoring capacity of the group via leadership, creates a component that hints at the legitimation process.

resources and sentiments. Overemphasis on mobility tends to break down social identity and group cohesion. Overemphasis on solidarity fragments sectors of the structure and creates potential class identification and conflict. Striking a balance between the two is critical for the survival of the social system.

Still another source of tension is related to the system’s size. One consequence of increasing size is decreasing shared resources relative to the amount of resources unique to member actors. Thus, the value attached to the commonality of shared resources decreases among the members.

This creates a tendency for member actors to form subsets of relations with others who share resources of common interest and value. Special interests and lobbying efforts by the subsets of actors and collectivities competing for rules in their favor can tip the legitimacy of the rules regarding the distribution of shared, especially public, resources available to the system. As shared resources become relatively more scarce, these competitions, if unchecked or unresolved, may lead to fragmenta-tion of loyalty. Loyalty then shifts to groups or clusters within the system rather than embracing the structure as a whole, endangering the identity and continued existence of the system as a whole. How to maintain the structure while it continues to grow in size and faces increasingly shared resources is an issue no open social system can avoid (see a similar discussion in Coleman 1986a, 1986b).

社会系统中张力的来源

由于篇幅的原因，我们不能进一步讨论法人（执行）行动者与自然行动者之间的关系问题，现实社会系统中的合法化与获利原则的正式化问题，以及对社会系统的忠诚并为其获利与个体和法人行动者的私利之间的永久张力问题。但是我可以指出可发展的社会系统中张力的几个来源。

最明显的一个来源是人力资本与公共资本之间的张力。由于基本生存本能的驱动以及获取公共资本的较高成本，自然人（natural person）更向于努力获得人力资本。社会系统需要在为参与者提供机会来维持和获得适当数量的人力资本，与实施自己的意志来生产和维持公共资本之间寻求一个平衡。

张力的第二个来源是动员与团结之间的平衡。动员代表着在社会等级制中向上流动的机会，而团结需要与其他参与者对利益和资源共享情感与合法性。[9] 动员鼓励行动者脱离他们共享利益与资源的社会圈子，以获得社会系统中更多或更好的资源。团结依赖于对共享相似资源与情感的他人的认同。过分强调动员会破坏社会认同与群体凝聚力。过分强调团结会打破结构的格局，引起潜在的阶级认同与阶级冲突。在二者之间保持平衡对于社会系统的持续存在是很重要的。

张力的来源还与系统的规模有关。规模增大的一个结果是减少了共享资源 —— 相对于成员行动者的独特的资源数量。因此，与共享资源的共性相联系的价值在成员中降低了。这样会产生一个趋势，成员行动者将同群体中具有共同利益与价值的人形成子关系。子关系具有特别的利益，它会通过游说与集体竟争利益，形成有利于自身的规则，从而破坏系统所使用的关于共享资源特别是公共资源的分配规则的合法性。随着共享资源变得更加缺乏，如果不制止或解除这些竟争，可能导致忠诚的崩溃。忠诚会转移到系统内的群体或关系丛上，而不会维护整体结构，这将危及系统整体的认同与存续。因此，当结构的规模不断扩大，共享资源不断增多时，如何维持结构是一个开放的社会系统所无法回避的问题（参见 Coleman, 1986a, 1986b 的同类讨论）。

[9] 我将团结定义为一个集体的行动者对彼此的资源所表达的情感和合法性的认同程度。这个概念有些类似于赫克特（Hechter, 1983）的定义。赫克特从理性选择的视角说了，群体的团结要出现，需要两个因素的存在：a）由可替代的资源获取来源所决定的个体和群体之间的依赖关系；b）群体监控个体行为的能力和领导能力。赫克特的著作是对将个体与义务和互惠，个体与不同的市场、权威和规范体系联系起来的互动的深入阐述，但是科尔曼（1986a, 1986b）只是涉及到这些内容，但没有展开论述。赫克特所确定的第一个因素是对埃默森和库克所提出的权力依赖理论（dependence-power theory）（Emerson, 1962Cook, Emerson, Gillmore, and Yamagishi, 1983; Yamagishi, Gillmore, and Cook, 1988）的一个直接应用。这个因素强调了个人的网络运作的重要性和对个人有价值的资源问题。这可以从个人通过与多种多样的行动者互动来寻求资源最大化的基本观点中得到理解。但是我认为这个资源依赖或权力依赖观点不是团结的必要条件，对我来说，它更多地反映了成员之间增强和保护彼此或共享资源的相互情感和意向。第二个因素，群体领导的能力和监控能力、是隐藏在合法化过程背后的因素。

## 1.10 Concluding Remarks

In this chapter, I have proposed two types of rational principles for action, minimization of resource loss and maximization of gain, with the former claiming primacy. This position, in support of the primacy of action and the viability of rationality as a theoretical argument, challenges the exclusive use of the economic profit-maximization (or even profit-optimization) approach as the sole basis of accounting for human actions, interactions, and the functioning of social organizations. Further noneconomic but quite rational calculations naturally and logically flow from issues fundamentally linked to the nature of human life, such as reproduction and succession, sovereignty of property, and the need for recognition of such sovereignty – issues that any theory of human society cannot ignore but that the economic approach does.

Consideration of these issues does not relegate sociology’s significance to psychology or cultural anthropology. Claims to property rights, recognition, transfer of resources, and succession are clearly all socially driven.

They describe social life and social activities and are meaningful only in interactive and networking contexts.

Not only does rationality for action spring from the innate nature of human life, but principles of interactions cannot afford to ignore two different types of resources: personal and social. A model that considers only transactions of human capital will never be able to account for the links between actors and social structure, because social networks and social capital are at the core of the micro–macro link. Concepts of power, dependence, solidarity, social contracts, and multilevel systems do not make sense until social capital is brought into consideration.

This chapter demonstrates how several simplified propositions concerning principles of action and interaction thus conceived can explain the emergence of social structure from bases of action and interaction: an action theory of society. The propositions and theoretical arguments presented here, I believe, provide building blocks for further analysis of the formation and development of social institutions and organizations.

For example, considerations can be extended to multiple social contracts and the subsequent hierarchical structure subsuming these contracts by way of variations in the social (recognition), political (legitimation), and economic (profit) rules.

Once a social system is in place, it inevitably becomes the dominant aspect of social life. Its imposition on individuals is increasingly pervasive. Therefore, we must necessarily take structural effects as given when we describe observable social systems. I agree with Hannan’s observation (1992) that organizations take on characteristics that are unintended and unpredictable from individual actions. However, the principle of the robustness of social systems, I believe, is derivable from the same principles guiding individual actions and interactions. That is, principles of loss minimization and gain maximization, rules of resource transfer and succession, and the primacy of social (public and shared) capital over human capital guide institutions and organizations to establish rules in their authority, opportunity, and sociocultural structures. Collective interest supersedes individual interest, just as primordial group interest supersedes individual actor interest. Loyalty supersedes performance in reward/punishment rules as recognition supersedes profit for individual actors. While the principles are similar, the primacy of collectivity over individuals forges structural variations not accountable from individual action and interactions.

Ultimately, a viable social theory must integrate both individual and structural elements. A comprehensive and balanced treatment of these two elements, I suspect, is the challenge sociologists must accept in order to offer theories that are both analytically and descriptively valid. In the next chapter, I will continue the line of theorization commenced in this chapter and pursue the issue of why recognition, rather than resource gain, is an important element in exchanges.

我在这一章里提出了行动的两类理性原则 一一 资源损失最小化与收益最大化，其中前者具有优先性。这个立场坚持行动的首要性与理性的可行性的理论观点，挑战了将经济学的利润最大化（乃至利润最优化）方法作为解释人类行动、互动与社会组织运转的唯一基础的做法。非经济的但是非常理性的计算，来自与人类生活的基本性质相联系的问题，如繁衔与继承、产权以及对这些主权认可的需要 —— 这些是任何社会理论都不能忽视的人类社会的问题，但是经济学的方法却忽视了。

2『损失最小化和收益最大化，不是同一个概念。做一张反常识卡片。（2021-01-07）』——已完成

对这些问题的考虑并不会把社会学降为心理学或文化人类学。对产权认可、资源转移和继承的要求，很显然都是为社会性所驱动的。对社会生活与社会活动的描述只有在互动与网络运作的背景下才有意义。

不仅行动理性源于人类生活的固有性质，而且互动原则不能忽视个人的与社会的两种不同类型的资源。只考虑人力资本交易的模型永远不能解释行动者与社会结构之间的联系，因为社会网络与社会资本是微观-宏观连接的核心。除非社会资本被考虑进来，否则权力、依赖、团结、社会契约和多层体系（multilevel systems）的概念都是没有意义的。

这一章展示了关于行动与互动原则的几个简化的命题，如何以行动和互动为基础来解释社会结构的生成：一个社会的行动理论。我相信这里提出的命题与理论观点为进一步分析社会制度与组织的形成和发展奠定了基石。例如，这些考虑可以扩展到多样化的社会契约与包含这些契约的等级制结构上 —— 通过社会（认可）、政治（合法化）和经济（获利）规则变量的方式将这些契约纳入进来。

一旦社会系统运作起来，它就不可避免地会成为社会生活的支配因素。施加在个人身上的控制会日益增多。因此，当我们描述可以观察的社会系统时，我们必须将结构性影响作为前提加以考虑。我同意汉南的观察（Hannan, 1992），组织表现出从个体行动中所无法预期、无法预测的特征。但是我相信，社会系统的刚性（robustness）原则与指导个体行动和互动的原则是同源的。也即，损失最小化与收益最大化的原则，资源的转移与继承规则，以及社会（公共的和共享的）资本比人力资本优越的原则，在指导着制度与组织建立其权威、机会和社会文化结构的规则。正如首要群体的利益优先于个体行动者的利益，集体的利益也优先于个人的利益。正如对个体行动者而言认可优先于利益，在奖赏 / 惩罚规则中忠诚优先于绩效。虽然原则相似，但是集体相对于个人的优先性造就了个体行动与互动所不能解释的结构性变量。

最后，一个讲得通的社会理论必须将个人与结构性的因素整合起来。我认为，为了提供既可以进行有效分析又可以进行有效描述的理论，如何全面地、协调地对待这两个因素，是社会学理论家必须接受的一个挑战。下一章我会继续沿着这一章所开始的理论线索，寻求对为什么是认可而不是资源收益是交换的一个重要因素的问题。
