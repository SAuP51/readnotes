## 附录 A

### 学术写作资源

1、写作指导书。

1a. 写作习惯养成书

《文思泉涌》：我在博士毕业之后才读到这本书，对我个人成长帮助很大。我觉得最大的收获是要养成好的写作习惯，每天定时写作。

《深度工作》：这本书是我个人特别推荐的一本书，是一位经济学教授写的，书中有很多给研究者的职业生涯、时间管理以及写作方面的建议，语言也风趣幽默，读起来非常享受。

《心流》和《自控力》：这两本书都是心理学家写的半学术半科普的书，会为读者在时间管理、自控等方面提供很大帮助。

《时间管理手账》：这本书是我读过的时间管理方面的书中感觉最有帮助的一本。

1b. 写作技巧书

我为了准备课程也看了很多这类书，但是大部分我觉得读了收获不大。下面列出的是我觉得非常好的书或文章。

《结构感》（The Sense of Structure）：作者是乔治·戈朋，他是我在杜克大学读书时写作课的老师，上完他的课我有一种醍醐灌顶、恍然大悟的感觉。我上完他的课立刻就买了这本书。

《科技英语写作进阶》：作者是利伯恩。这本书比戈朋的书更全面，我上课使用的很多内容，包括例句都借鉴了这本书。作者借鉴了很多戈朋的观点，还特别感谢了他。

《英语写作手册：风格的要素》：作者是威廉·斯特伦克（William Strunk），他是康奈尔大学的英语教授，E.B. 怀特（E.B.White）对此书进行了修订。这本书虽然很薄，但涵盖了许多重要内容。

《组织论文的 10 条简单规则》（Ten Simple Rules for Structuring Papers）：作者是布雷特·门什（Brett Mensh）和康拉德·科尔丁（Konrad Kording）。文章给出了 10 条关于论文写作的建议，非常有学习和参考意义。

更多关于写作技巧的信息可以参考很多线上资源，如普度大学的「Online writing lab」，我很多上课的资料来自于此：

[OWL // Purdue Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/)

2、同义词网站。

同义词搜索对于非母语者扩充词汇量非常有帮助。

[Synonyms and Antonyms of Words | Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/)

3、学术措辞库。

[Academic Phrasebank | The University of Manchester](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/)

学术措辞库是一个初学者会觉得很好用的工具，堪称神器。其中总结了写文章的各个部分，如前言、讨论等可以用到的句型。它的一个好处是分类非常详细，「提出研究问题」「前人研究的矛盾、空白」或者「当你的结果与前人一致 / 不一致」等部分均给出了写作的建议。

4、语料库。

其实谷歌是一个很好的语料库。如何使用呢？比如我们非母语者在写作中一个很大的麻烦在于不知道用什么介词。这时在谷歌上输入前后的词，就会出现最常用的介词。所有当代英语的语料库都可以实现这个功能。

5、逻辑思维训练。

《这才是心理学》：作者是多伦多大学心理学教授基思·斯坦诺维奇。这是一本值得读十遍的神书！书中厘清了很多研究逻辑问题。

《你以为你以为的就是你以为的吗》：英国作家朱利安·巴吉尼（Julian Baggini）和吉里米·斯唐鲁普（Jeremy Stangroom）共同撰写的哲学普及著作。作者精心设计了 12 道检测思维清晰度的逻辑谜题，可以帮助你快速提高思考力和逻辑能力。

「没药花园」：一位人类学博士的公众号，我个人觉得非常棒，每篇文章都是基于真实的案例，读起来都像逻辑缜密的论文，非常享受。还有很多与犯罪心理有关的内容。

关于推理的文章或者书：我从小喜欢看各种探案集，诸如《福尔摩斯探案集》、阿加莎的作品等。从推理的过程中，不知不觉就会提高自己的逻辑思维能力。

6、引用和改写。

### 附录 C

写作修改范例

范例一：

第一个例子应该属于「伤筋动骨」型改法。

原稿：

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a developmental disorder diagnosed on the basis of social-communication deficits, and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). There are a number of traditional treatment approaches for ASD, including: (a) relationship-based treatments, such as floor time [1][1]; (b) skill-based treatments, such as the cognitive behavioral methods [2]; (c) physiologically oriented interventions, such as sensory integration [3]; and (d) psychopharmacologic treatments, such as the vision therapy [4]. However, the heavy reliance on professional therapists for current intervention programs engenders problems such as limited available therapists, high costs for training, and low reliability due to variability of therapists' experiences. In recent years, people has been exploring new methods, such us robotics and virtue reality [5] to serve as supplement for the traditional ASD treatment. As technology developed rapidly, especially in robotics, the treatment innovation using robots for children with ASD is expected.

第一段的问题是，我们打算投稿心理学–计算机交叉期刊，不应该以孤独症为开头，所以改成以介绍机器人为开头。原稿的开头比较适合孤独症专业期刊。写作思路应改成先讲现代社会中机器人越来越多地走进人们的生活（从更大的角度切入），然后讲儿童怎么理解机器人以及与机器人互动成为一个重要问题，再引入特殊儿童怎么理解机器人以及与机器人互动。

Previous research has shown that robots can offer ASD children a safe and predictable environment [6], and provide help in developing social skills [7]. However, rare research in this area has focused on the core symptoms for ASD children, the social-communication deficits. More specifically, children with ASD have been repeatedly found to have difficulty in understanding others'mental states [8] and learning complex social rules in interpersonal interaction [9]. This study investigated whether children with ASD showed similar difficulty in inferring "mental states" and learning social rules when facing social robots.

这里需要指明，由于孤独症儿童的社交障碍（理解他人心理的困难），想用机器人给孤独症儿童做干预，其效果可能受到他们理解机器人以及与机器人互动的困难的制约（说明研究问题的重要性）。这里还需要明确研究问题。

Distrust and deception, two types of important social behaviors emerging and developing in childhood, require the ability to understand other's mental state [10]. Yi et al. found that when they are repeatedly deceived by an adult, children with ASD showed a trust bias, and are also less likely to deceive back compared to TD children [10]. It is intriguing whether children with ASD would show a similar difficulty learning to distrust and deceive a social robot. In this research, we adapted the distrust and deception tasks by Yi et al. using the social robot Nao as the role to interact with children. Robot Nao is found to own the most social and physical attraction in children whose age ranged from 8 to 14 years [11].

需要明确具体的研究问题，针对每个问题，如何设计实验来研究，还需要明确假设。

总的来说，这个前言没有很好的思路，没有明确的研究问题，也没有强调研究问题的重要性。所以我们做了多次改动，最后形成以下的版本。

修改稿：

Our daily lives have changed dramatically thanks to innovations in information and communication technologies, which make science-fiction of the past gradually become commonplace reality. Social robots that have a human-like appearance, also referred to as humanoid robots, are often capable of sensory motor abilities, autonomous movements, and verbal and non-verbal communications (Fong, Nourbakhsh, & Dautenhahn, 2003; Jipson & Gelman, 2007). They are increasingly able to substitute humans in the labor force, as childminders, office receptionists, and tour guides. It is evident that social robots will have increased participation in our daily lives so that our children will grow up in a new environment where social robots are ubiquitous. （从更大的角度引入研究问题）

The growing presence of social robots makes life more convenient, but also raises certain questions, such as how children perceive and interact with robots, and how that influences their development and learning. Some research efforts have been made to address such questions. Kahn and colleagues (2006) found that preschoolers perceive a robotic dog and a stuffed dog similarly in terms of animacy, biological properties, mental states, social rapport, and moral standing. Kahn et al. (2012) found that most children perceived that a robot had mental states (had feelings), was a social being (could be a friend), deserved fair treatment, and should not be harmed psychologically, but did not believe the robot was entitled to its own liberty or civil rights. This implied that children treated the humanoid robot in an anthropomorphic way to some extent, but did not perceive the robot as completely human. Thus, Kahn, Gary and Shen (2013) proposed the New Ontological Category (NOC) hypothesis, that children do not categorize a social robot as either animate or inanimate, but as a new ontological entity with unique properties. In addition, when interacting with social robots, children treated them not only as social companions (Shiomi, Kanda, Ishiguro, & Hagita, 2007), but also as knowledgeable and informative interlocutors (Breazeal et al., 2016). Furthermore, children could learn knowledge and skills from robots through imitative learning, facilitated through social signals, such as eye contact (Itakura et al., 2008). Children could also learn words from a robot (Moriguchi, Kanda, Ishiguro, Shimada, & Itakura, 2011). （缩小研究问题）

Besides their educational role for typically-developing (TD) children, robots have also been introduced to help children with special needs acquire knowledge and skills, especially for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the impairments in social-communication abilities and restricted and repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Social robots have shown many advantages relative to inter-personal interactions in educating children with ASD. When interacting with robots, children with ASD have shown more interests (Dautenhahn & Billard, 2002), experienced more elevated attention (Scassellati, Admoni, & Mataric, 2012), and engaged more in reversal learning task (Costescu, Vanderborght, & David, 2014), compared to interacting with people. When interacting with a humanoid robot, children with ASD are also more likely to maintain a calm and active mood (Kozima, Nakagawa, & Yasuda, 2005), more comfortable with emotional response modification (Ueyama, 2015), and less likely to display repetitive behaviors (Lee, Takehashi, Nagai, Obinata, & Stefanov, 2012). These findings indicate that children with ASD might be more likely and more comfortable interacting with robots than with people, and such interactions can have a positive impact on their learning process. Given the specific impairments in social learning in children with ASD (Bushwick, 2001), it is important to understand the feasibility of using social robots in teaching social rules to children with ASD. The current study aimed to explore how children with ASD would learn from robot-child interactions by creating a unique experimental setup for children with ASD to learn two important forms of social skills – distrust and deception. （指出研究问题的重要性，明确研究问题）

The emergence of distrust and deception behaviors are two major milestones in the social-cognitive development of children, which profoundly influence their real life (e.g., Baron-Cohen, Tager-Flusberg, & Cohen, 2005; Lee, 2013). Other people's testimony is an important source of knowledge. To learn efficiently, children had to evaluate the reliability of the informants. However, young preschoolers, especially younger than four years of age, tend to trust people unconditionally and indiscriminately (Clément, Koenig, & Harris, 2004; Jaswal et al., 2010). With increased age, preschoolers gradually acquire more complicated information and learn to process and identify it within a more expansive social milieu (e.g., Lee & Cameron, 2000), and learn to evaluate whether informants deserve trust on the basis of various factors, such as their past reliability, intentions, and past deceiving behaviors (e.g., Corriveau & Harris, 2009; Koenig & Harris, 2005; Vanderbilt, Liu, & Heyman, 2011). Not until 4- to 5-year-old could children develop skepticism towards others' testimony and selective trust, which would help them to identify the reliable source of information and foster their knowledge learning (Vanderbilt et al., 2011). In order to protect themselves from being misled by false information and to acquire credible information to meet their developmental needs, children learn to distrust unreliable sources. Children develop selective learning and the ability to perceive relativity, which assists them in coping with more advanced and complex information in their progress towards adulthood.

Closely related to distrust, deception behaviors also mark preschool age social development. Deception behaviors typically begin around three years old (Lewis, Stanger & Sullivan, 1989), and as children grow, they deceive others with higher frequency and more sophisticated strategies (Chandler, Fritz, & Hala, 1989; Russell, Mauthner, Sharpe, & Tidswell, 1991; Sodian, 1991). At four to five years, children begin deliberately deceiving their opponents in more situations (Gratch, 1964; DeVries, 1970; Shultz & Cloghesy, 1981). Although parents may worry that their children's lying behavior may have bad consequences, a more contemporary view holds that deception may have positive effects on children's cognitive skills (Ding et al., 2018). Evidence comes from the recent finding that learning to deceive in a four-day training program could enhance preschoolers' Theory of Mind (ToM) and executive function (Ding et al., 2018).

以上两段对本研究因变量（信任和欺骗）做了简要的文献回顾，说明为什么这两个能力是重要的，接下来说明孤独症患者在这方面的缺陷。

Typically, children mainly learn distrust and deception rules through interpersonal interactions based on various verbal and nonverbal social cues, based on past experiences. It is not surprising then, that children with ASD, who have social learning impairments, display difficulties in learning to distrust and deceive others. Yi et al. (2014) developed distrust and deception tasks, in which children were asked to join in a hide-and-seek game, with the experimenter always offering misleading information about the location of prizes; the experimenter and children then switched roles, and the children had the opportunity to deceive the same experimenter back about prize locations. Results indicated impairments in learning to distrust and deceive others within a social context; children with ASD showed a trust bias toward the adult who repeatedly deceived them, and were less likely to reciprocate deception. In a follow-up study, where the social components of the distrust and deception tasks were minimized (using physical rather than social cues), children with ASD showed comparable learning performance as their TD peers (Yang et al., 2017). Another study that examined trust-building in adults with ASD confirmed difficulty in social learning, particularly encoding incoming social information and applying it to update social expectations (Maurer, Chambon, Bourgeois, Leboyer, & Zalla, 2017). Such findings indicate that individuals with ASD have difficulty learning social rules, and by reducing the social components in the learning process, children with ASD may experience less difficulty in acquiring these skills.

In the present study, we aimed to examine whether children with ASD would show similar difficulty in learning to distrust and deceive social robots as in interpersonal interactions. We used similar distrust and deception tasks adapted from Yi et al. (2014) and Yang et al. (2017) by replacing the role of the adult human with a humanoid robot. In the distrust task, the robot always provided misleading information about the location of hidden prizes, and children had to learn to distrust the robot in order to win the prizes. In the deception task, children needed to reciprocally deceive the robot to gain more prizes.

简要介绍本研究的具体研究问题、用于研究因变量的范式并回顾文献。接下来，详细提出三个具体问题及其研究假设。

This study was designed to address three research questions. First, how do children with ASD learn to distrust and deceive a humanoid robot from interacting with it, compared to TD children? Based on the previous research showing that social robots were perceived as a social being having mental states (e.g., Kahn et al., 2006; Kahn et al., 2012), we expected that children with ASD would still experience difficulty learning to distrust and deceive robot compared to TD children.

Second, how is the learning of distrust and deception correlated with the child's perception of the robot? The previous research has found that robots are perceived as neither animate nor inanimate, but as a new category of entity (Kahn et al., 2013). However, other researches manifested that both children with and without ASD perceived robots as toys, and children with ASD also perceived them as machines (e.g., Peca, Stimut, pintea, Costescu, & Vanderborght, 2014). Also, adolescents with ASD have been found to have more human impressions of ‘humanness' for the robot than TD adolescents (Kumazaki et al., 2018). This discrepancy in perception of the robot might affect children's learning of distrust and deception. In the previous research, children were sensitive to the social responsiveness of the robot, and were willing to learn from the robot with contingent responsiveness (Breazeal et al., 2016). Based on this finding, we speculated that how children perceived the robot, especially in terms of human-likeness, would affect their performance in distrust and deception tasks. In the current study, children's anthropomorphic perception of the robot, and the role this perception played in learning distrust and deception, was assessed using questionnaires. We expected that children with ASD with more anthropomorphic thinking of the robot would experience greater difficulty in learning distrust and deception.

And third, will interaction with the robot facilitate social learning in children with ASD, compared to their learning from interpersonal interactions? For this purpose, we further compared the distrust and deception performance measured in the current study with the previous ones from Yang et al. (2017), which used nearly identical tasks but with interpersonal rather than human-robot interactions, in order to examine any differences in learning between the two forms of interactions. We expected to see a facilitation effect of the human-robot interaction on distrust and deception learning in children with ASD in contrast to interpersonal interactions.

范例二：

下面是一个「不如重写」的例子。

原稿：

Rate of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has risen sharply in the past several years, reaching 1 in 68 in the United States [12]. Despite the fact that existing assessment methods show high validity, current ASD diagnostic approaches are both time and labour consuming. In particular, the diagnostic instruments have been designed to measure impairments mainly in: (1) language and communication; (2) reciprocal social interactions; and (3) restricted, repetitive behaviors. The most widely used instruments include the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) [9] and the revised version ADOS-2 [6]. These approaches require the accompany and administration of clinically trained professionals and the whole process can take up to 90 minutes. The interactive, human-in-loop nature of these tests not only increase unnecessary costs, but also reduces the chance of early diagnosis.

Behavioral studies found that ASD individuals have impairments in recognizing human faces, leading to atypical face processing [11]. Although there exists considerable controversy regarding whether ASD individuals also scan faces differently, recent studies indeed indicate evidence of different eye movement patterns from ASD individuals [13, 14]. The way how ASD individuals scan faces has been studied by a number of previous literatures with eye tracking techniques. Existing studies have consistently indicated that children and adults show reduced visual attentions to faces compared to their typically developed (TD) counterparts [4]. While these closely related studies form the fundamental bases of this research, most of them are only restricted to discovering statistical significant ASD patterns and few of them considered prediction-level tasks. A major contribution of this paper is that we propose a machine learning based framework on face scanning pattern analysis as an alternative ASD measurement. The advantage of such diagnostic framework is highlighted as follows: Compared with traditional instruments such as ADOS-G and ADOS-2, the proposed method not only requires much less human interaction and expertise, but also makes the whole diagnostic problem objective scalable. There are studies that also use machine learning to optimize the diagnosis process [1, 8, 3]. These studies, however, do not change the highly interactive essence of traditional diagnosis procedure.

Another major contribution includes the improvement on discriminative eye movement pattern discovery over existing approaches such as area of interest (AOI) and iMAP [2]. The traditional area of interest (AOI) approach was widely used by many to conduct analysis on the face scanning patterns. The AOI approach seeks to measure fixations that fall within a predefined area of interest, typically including the AOIs of eyes, nose and mouth. With the defined AOIs, one is able to statistically estimate the eye movement patterns of a participant on different areas of a face. A common problem with the AOI approach is that it tends to lump fixations to a relatively large area without further discrimination. In addition, the boundary of AOI is often determined empirically and is influenced by the semantic meaning of face parsing without statistical and psychological justification. On the other hand, a subject's visual attention could be largely influenced by certain sub-AOI regions which are highly responsive to human brains as mid-level visual features. The iMAP approach was proposed as an alternative method which supplements the AOI approach regarding such issues. iMAP uses a Gaussian kernel to spatially smooth each fixation map and operates at pixel level to compare different conditions or groups with statistical normalization. It is, therefore, able to reveal discriminative spatial differences at a much finer spatial resolution.

One of the key feature extraction steps in our work is to use the k-means algorithm to cluster the coordinates of eye gaze and divide the face image into different sub-regions. This step shares certain similarity with both AOI and iMAP, in the sense that it partitions spatial face regions like AOI, but is more data-driven and returns more flexible partition boundaries like iMAP. The consequent advantage is that in stead of hand-crafting certain face regions in the conventional AOI approach, a data-driven strategy allows automatically partition of face regions with statistical importance and flexible boundaries. Intuitively, the cluster centroids are the most representative face scanning "hot spots" found by k-means. However, our proposed work not only targets the eye gaze coordinates corresponding to the spatial domain of a (face) image, but also exploits the motion domain of eye movement. In addition to coordinates, we also conduct k-means clustering on the difference of consecutive eye gaze coordinates. The expectation is that the magnitude and the direction of eye motion may also reveal certain ASD evidence. To our best knowledge, very few previous literatures have investigated from this perspective.

Following the k-means clustering is the "bag-of-words" (BoW) histogram feature representations of both coordinates and motion magnitudes. The cluster centroids returned by k-means are referred to as "dictionary words" in the "bag-of-words" model. Such histogram representation is basically an orderless frequency encoding of both the participant's visual attention on each part of a face, and the motion magnitudes/directions. In addition to the order less representation, we also incorporate an n-gram model in feature extraction to consider the latent temporal correlation. In the experiments, we will comprehensively evaluate the prediction performance of the above features as well as a fusion of these methods.

这一版原文的主要问题是思路太「工科」，钻到了各种技术细节里，没有通过背景介绍（文献回顾）提出主要的研究问题并归纳研究思路。我们现在就来把它改成一篇心理学的文章。

修改稿：

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heritable, lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder with complicated causes and courses (Amaral et al., 2008). One of the key symptoms in ASD is their impaired social interaction and interpersonal communication (DSM-V, APA, 2013). Since interpersonal interaction and communication rely heavily on interpreting facial cues of other people, research on the face processing in ASD has attracted intensive attention in the last decade (see Tanaka & Sung, 2013, for a review). Overall, individuals with ASD have difficulty recognizing human faces and interpreting facial emotions (Tanaka & Sung, 2013). Eye tracking studies further reveal that individuals with ASD exhibit reduced to attention to human faces, especially the eye region, relative to typically developing (TD) individuals (see Falck-Ytter & von Hofsten, 2011, for a review). Tanaka and Sung (2013) attributed this eye-avoidance-face-processing pattern of ASD to their adaptive strategy to avoid the social threatening and discomfort elicited by direct eye contact. The reduced attention to faces and diminished eye contact have been found in individuals with ASD as early as the first year of life (e.g., Osterling et al., 2002; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005). Jones and Klin (2013) found that a decline in eye fixation at 2 to 6 months could predict later diagnosis of ASD. These findings suggest the possibility of using eye movements during face processing as a potential indicator of ASD. In this paper, we explored the possibility of using the machine learning algorithm to identify ASD based on their eye movements when viewing faces.

第一段从孤独症入手（因为目标期刊是孤独症专业期刊），介绍其概念。之后将问题缩小到孤独症的面孔加工，简单介绍主要的理论和证据。接下来提出研究问题：怎么利用面孔的扫视轨迹来做孤独症的自动分类。这里引出机器学习的概念，承接下一段。

Machine learning is a procedure that trains the computer algorithm to analyze a set of observed data and statistically learns the latent patterns. It has been used to perform a variety of prediction tasks in psychology recently, for example, the emerging field of multi-model human sensing, where the states of human, such as emotion, are analyzed with computer vision and speech techniques based on machine learning (Bartlett et al. 2004). Machine learning has also been applied to autism research in several previous studies based on the behavioral observations or brain activities (e.g., Crippa et al., 2015; Deshpande et al., 2013; Duda et al., 2014; Kosmicki et al., 2015; Stahl et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014). Despite such a fact, the importance and power of machine learning is yet to be fully discovered in autism research. While machine learning in general usually consists of feature extraction, feature selection, model learning, and prediction, a number of machine-learning-based autism studies mainly focus on how to effectively select a subset of features from large amounts of existing features of the standardized diagnostic scales to shorten the diagnosis time. For instance, Kosmicki et al. (2015) proposed a machine-learning-based feature selection framework to reduce the number of behavioral features and measurements in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Duda et al. (2014) used machine learning to train a classifier which can reduce 72% in length in the ADOS-G test with 97% accuracy. Some recent autism studies start to address the task of classification and prediction besides the feature selection (Crippa et al., 2015; Stahl et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014). For example, a machine learning framework was proposed to classify low-functioning children with ASD based on the kinematic analysis of a reach-to-drop task (Crippa et al., 2015). This motivated us to take the face scanning patterns, which have been consistently found to be atypical in ASD by previous studies, as input to classify children with ASD. Eye movements encode rich information about the attention distribution and cognitive strategies during face viewing that may indicate the potential risk of ASD, such as the fixation durations and counts at different facial areas, the speed and direction of the saccades, as well as the temporal information of the face scanning pattern. Automatically handling eye gaze data with machine learning methods makes the prediction process much more scalable than manually doing so. The fundamental purpose of this paper is to propose a machine learning framework which learns from the observed face scanning patterns to automatically identify children with ASD. We hope that such a framework can generate useful mid-level features in the ASD evaluation, and that by adopting eye movement, subjective factors can be reduced to make the ASD evaluation a more objective process.

这一段介绍机器学习，特别是在孤独症领域，前人在研究中如何用机器学习来辅助和简化孤独症的诊断。

Our work to some extent shares the similar spirit with Crippa et al. (2015), except that we focus on analyzing face scanning patterns to predict ASD. We adopted the eye movement dataset from a previous published work, which asked children with and without ASD to recognize same- and other-race face while their eye movements being tracked (Yi et al., 2016). Different from previous literature focusing on the statistical significance of ASD symptoms conveyed by the face scanning patterns, we addressed the prediction problem and sought to propose a machine learning solution to measure the potential ASD risk based on the face scanning patterns in a face recognition task. Particularly, we used a data-driven approach to extract features from the face scanning data and a support vector machine (SVM) to do the classification. The predictive value of this machine learning model was evaluated in terms of its accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, and so on.

这一段提出我们的研究思路，说明具体的做法。

相比于原稿，修改稿主要在引出科学问题和文献回顾方面做了很大改动。需要说明的是，一篇文章有多种改法，我的改法不一定是最好的。比如这篇文章是我好几年前修改的，囿于当时的业务水平，只能改成这样。如果我现在来修改，还能在这个基础上再改一版，比如我会在第一段讲孤独症领域的挑战在于诊断困难，以及早期诊断的困难，来突出研究问题（用机器学习来自动识别孤独症）的重要性（原文在讨论中才提到这一点）。所以要以发展的眼光来看问题，不断从投稿、和同行的交流中提高业务水平，才是制胜之道。

## 后记：写作，自我疗愈之路

这本书的大部分内容完成于 2020 年上半年，我们为了抗疫而进行了长达 6 个月的闭关。疫情暴发初期，许多人和我一样，由于负面新闻铺天盖地，每天都在体验着替代性创伤，出现了各种负面情绪，但是又没有办法不去关注。该做的工作，比如写文章和写基金申请，又做不下去，只觉得自己的专业太没用了，文也不行，武也不行。作为基础学科，它不能研究病毒的特性和疫情的走势；作为应用学科，也不能上前线「打仗」救人。一时间，自己工作、研究的内容都失去了意义感。这也进一步加剧了负面情绪的蔓延。

面对疫情，很多人采取了分心的策略，比如追剧就是一个非常好的消磨时间的方法。平时觉得冗长的电视剧，此刻是多么必要啊。还可以把平时没有时间读的书都读了。但我更多采取主动的方法：在力所能及的范围内，积极为疫情做些事情。我认为这是对抗疫情带来的焦虑的最好办法，既能分心，又可以减轻无力感。

这种想法源于朋友的一个电话，通过聊天我发现原来大家都一样煎熬，我就提议说：「要不咱们做个跟疫情有关的项目？」一拍即合，于是我们在一周之内制作出一个线上调查，调查人们在重大灾难中的情绪调节、风险感知和决策特点。然后，我又开始了由于疫情可能产生的对湖北特别是武汉的污名化研究。做了两个星期后，我们都感觉自己的抑郁情绪得到了很大的缓解。一方面，因为做这个项目花了大量时间，导致没时间过度关注新闻；另一方面，感觉自己为对抗疫情做了些事情（重要的不是真的做了什么，而是自己感觉做了什么）。

做完这几个项目以后，我就想可以开始写这本书了。之前由于工作繁忙，只能写一些零星的内容。现在有了大段时间来整理材料和写作，是一件非常好的事情。在几个月后，我可以对自己说，我没有浪费这段时间，我做了很有意义的事情。有一段时间，我感觉写文章已经很难给我带来幸福感和成就感了，反而是指导学生写文章让我很有成就感。写一本写作指导书，帮助更多的人提高，这件事情在我看来也充满了意义感。写这本书，对我来说是一种非常好的自我疗愈方式：首先，表达性写作本是心理治疗中一种减轻焦虑的方法；其次，写这本书占据了我大量的时间，让我足够分心，不关注负面消息；最后，写书帮助别人也是帮助自己，生活的意义感帮我很快走出了负面情绪。

虽然我们因为疫情付出了太多的代价，一些人离我们而去，一些人失去了工作，一些人中断了学习，但我一直觉得疫情不完全是一件坏事。疫情启动死亡焦虑，而面对死亡能让人更好地思考人生的意义，思考到底什么才是最重要的。它提醒我们：生命是有限的，不要浪费时间去实现别人的梦想，而应该倾听你内心最深处的声音。你想做的事情是什么？疫情为我们寻找答案提供了一个很好的契机。正如我在北京大学心理与认知科学学院 2020 届毕业典礼上所说：「倾听自己内心的声音，做真正想做的事情，其他的事情其实并没有那么重要。」

这本书写在「战火纷飞」之时，成书于「春暖花开」之日（革命尚未成功，同志仍需努力），谨以此书纪念这段特别的时光。
