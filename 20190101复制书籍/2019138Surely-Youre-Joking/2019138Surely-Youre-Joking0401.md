We got to the El Rancho Hotel and the girls continued this game of acting towards me like everybody normally acts towards them:「Would you like to gamble?」they asked. I gambled a little bit with their money and we all had a good time.

After a while they said,「Look, we see a live one, so we’ll have to leave you now,」and they went back to work.

One time I was sitting at a bar and I noticed two girls with an older man. Finally he walked away, and they came over and sat next to me: the prettier and more active one next to me, and her duller friend, named Pam, on the other side.

Things started going along very nicely right away. She was very friendly. Soon she was leaning against me, and I put my arm around her. Two men came in and sat at a table nearby. Then, before the waitress came, they walked out.

「Did you see those men?」my new-found friend said.

「Yeah.」

「They’re friends of my husband.」

「Oh? What _is_ this?」

「You see, I just married John Big」–she mentioned a very famous name–「and we’ve had a little argument. We’re on our honeymoon, and John is always gambling. He doesn’t pay any attention to me, so I go off and enjoy myself, but he keeps sending spies around to check on what I’m doing.」

She asked me to take her to her motel room, so we went in my car. On the way I asked her,「Well, what about John?」

She said,「Don’t worry. Just look around for a big red car with two antennas. If you don’t see it, he’s not around.」

The next night I took the「Gibson girl」and a friend of hers to the late show at the Silver Slipper, which had a show later than all the hotels. The girls who worked in the other shows liked to go there, and the master of ceremonies announced the arrival of the various dancers as they came in. So in I went with these two _lovely_ dancers on my arm, and he said,「And here comes Miss So-and-so and Miss So-and-so from the Flamingo!」Everybody looked around to see who was coming in. I felt _great!_

We sat down at a table near the bar, and after a little while there was a bit of a flurry–waiters moving tables around, security guards, with guns, coming in. They were making room for a celebrity. JOHN BIG was coming in!

He came over to the bar, right next to our table, and right away two guys wanted to dance with the girls I brought. They went off to dance, and I was sitting alone at the table when John came over and sat down at my table.「How _are_ yah?」he said.「Whattya doin’ in Vegas?」

I was sure he’d found out about me and his wife.「Just foolin’ around . . .」(I’ve gotta act tough, right?)

「How long ya been here?」

「Four or five nights.」

「I know ya,」he said.「Didn’t I see you in Florida?」

「Well, I really don’t know. .

He tried this place and that place, and I didn’t know what he was getting at.「I know,」he said;「It was in El Morocco.」(El Morocco was a big nightclub in New York, where a lot of big operators go–like professors of theoretical physics, right?)

「That must have been it,」I said. I was wondering when he was going to get _to_ it. Finally he leaned over to me and said,「Hey, will you introduce me to those girls you’re with when they come back from dancing?」

That’s all he wanted; he didn’t know me from a hole in the wall! So I introduced him, but my show girl friends said they were tired and wanted to go home.

The next afternoon, I saw John Big at the Flamingo, standing at the bar, talking to the bartender about cameras and taking pictures. He must be an amateur photographer: He’s got all these bulbs and cameras, but he says the dumbest things about them. I decided he wasn’t an amateur photographer after all; he was just a rich guy who bought himself some cameras.

I figured by that time that he didn’t know I had been fooling around with his wife; he only wanted to talk to me because of the girls I had. So I thought I would play a game. I’d invent a part for myself: John Big’s assistant.

「Hi, John,」I said.「Let’s take some pictures. I’ll carry your flashbulbs.」

I put the flashbulbs in my pocket, and we started off taking pictures. I’d hand him flashbulbs and give him advice here and there; he _likes_ that stuff.

We went over to the Last Frontier to gamble, and he started to win. The hotels don’t like a high roller to leave, but I could see he wanted to go. The problem was how to do it gracefully.

「John, we have to leave now,」I said in a serious voice.

「But I’m winning.」

「Yes, but we _have_ made an appointment this afternoon.」

「OK, get my car.」

「Certainly, Mr. Big!」He handed me the keys and told me what it looked like (I didn’t let on that I knew).

I went out to the parking lot, and sure enough, there was this big, fat, wonderful car with the two antennas. I climbed into it and turned the key–and it wouldn’t start. It had an automatic transmission; they had just come out and I didn’t know anything about them. After a bit I accidentally shifted it into PARK and it started. I drove it very carefully, like a million-dollar car, to the hotel entrance, where I got out and went inside to the table where he was still gambling, and said,「Your car is ready, sir!」

「I have to quit,」he announced, and we left.

He had me drive the car.「I want to go to the El Rancho,」he said.「Do you know any girls there?」

I knew one girl there rather well, so I said「Yeah.」By this time I felt confident enough that the only reason he was going along with this game I had invented was that he wanted to meet some girls, so I brought up a delicate subject:「I met your wife the other night..

「My wife? My wife’s not here in Las Vegas.」

I told him about the girl I met in the bar.

「Oh! I know who you mean; I met that girl and her friend in Los Angeles and brought them to Las Vegas. The first thing they did was use my phone for an hour to talk to their friends in Texas. I got mad and threw ‘em out! So she’s been going around telling everybody that she’s my wife, eh?」

So _that_ was cleared up.

We went into the El Rancho, and the show was going to start in about fifteen minutes. The place was packed; there wasn’t a seat in the house. John went over to the majordomo and said,「I want a table.」

「Yes, sir, Mr. Big! It will be ready in a few minutes.」

John tipped him and went off to gamble. Meanwhile I went around to the back, where the girls were getting ready for the show, and asked for my friend. She came out and I explained to her that John Big was with me, and he’d like some company after the show.

「Certainly, Dick,」she said.「I’ll bring some friends and we’ll see you after the show.」

I went around to the front to find John. He was still gambling.「Just go in without me,」he said.「I’ll be there in a minute.」

There were two tables, at the very front, right at the edge of the stage. Every other table in the place was packed. I sat down by myself. The show started before John came in, and the show girls came out. They could see me at the table, all by myself. Before, they thought I was some small-time. professor; now they see I’m a BIG OPERATOR.

Finally John came in, and soon afterwards some people sat down at the table next to us–John’s「wife」and her friend Pam, with two men!

I leaned over to John:「She’s at the other table.」

「Yeah.」

She saw I was taking care of John, so she leaned over to me from the other table and asked,「Could I talk to John?」

I didn’t say a word. John didn’t say anything either.

I waited a little while, then I leaned over to John:「She wants to talk to you.」

Then he waited a little bit.「All right,」he said.

I waited a little more, and then I leaned over to her:「John will speak to you now.」

She came over to our table. She started working on「Johnnie,」sitting very close to him. Things were beginning to get straightened out a little bit, I could tell.

I love to be mischievous, so every time they got things straightened out a little bit, I reminded John of something:「The telephone, John . . .」

「Yeah!」he said.「What’s the idea, spending an hour on the telephone?」

She said it was Pam who did the calling.

Things improved a little bit more, so I pointed out that it was her idea to _bring_ Pam.

「Yeah!」he said. (I was having a great time playing this game; it went on for quite a while.)

When the show was over, the girls from the El Rancho came over to our table and we talked to them until they had to go back for the next show. Then John said,「I know a nice little bar not too far away from here. Let’s go over there.」

I drove him over to the bar and we went in.「See that woman over there?」he said.「She’s a really good lawyer. Come on, I’ll introduce you to her.」

John introduced us and excused himself to go to the restroom. He never came back. I think he wanted to get back with his「wife」and I was beginning to interfere.

I said,「Hi」to the woman and ordered a drink for myself (still playing this game of not being impressed and not being a gentleman).

「You know,」she said to me,「I’m one of the better lawyers here in Las Vegas.」

「Oh, no, you’re not,」I replied coolly.「You might be a lawyer during the day, but you know what you are right now? You’re just a barfly in a small bar in Vegas.」

She liked me, and we went to a few places dancing. She danced very well, and I _love_ to dance, so we had a great time together.

Then, all of a sudden in the middle of a dance, my back began to hurt. It was some kind of big pain, and it started suddenly. I know now what it was: I had been up for three days and nights having these crazy adventures, and I was completely _exhausted_.

She said she would take me home. As soon as I got into her bed I went BONGO! I was out.

The next morning I woke up in this beautiful bed. The sun was shining, and there was no sign of her. Instead, there was a maid.「Sir,」she said,「are you awake? I’m ready with breakfast.」

「Well, uh . . .」

「I’ll bring it to you. What would you like?」and she went through a whole menu of breakfasts.

I ordered breakfast and had it in bed–in the bed of a woman I didn’t know; I didn’t know who she was or where she came from!

I asked the maid a few questions, and she didn’t know anything about this mysterious woman either: She had just been hired, and it was her first day on the job. She thought I was the man of the house, and found it curious that I was asking _her_ questions. I got dressed, finally, and left. I never saw the mysterious woman again.

The first time I was in Las Vegas I sat down and figured out the odds for everything, and I discovered that the odds for the crap table were something like .493. If I bet a dollar, it would only cost me 1.4 cents. So I thought to myself,「Why am I so reluctant to bet? It hardly costs anything!」

So I started betting, and right away I lost five dollars in succession–one, two, three, four, five. I was supposed to be out only seven cents; instead, I was five dollars behind! I’ve never gambled since then (with my own money, that is). I’m very lucky that I started off losing.

One time I was eating lunch with one of the show girls. It was a quiet time in the afternoon; there was not the usual big bustle, and she said,「See that man over there, walking across the lawn? That’s Nick the Greek. He’s a professional gambler.」

Now I knew damn well what all the odds were in Las Vegas, so I said,「How can he be a professional gambler?」

「I’ll call him over.」

Nick came over and she introduced us.」Marilyn tells me that you’re a professional gambler.」

「That’s correct.」

「Well, I’d like to know how it’s possible to make your living gambling, because at the table, the odds are .493.」

「You’re right,」he said,「and I’ll explain it to you. I don’t bet on the table, or things like that. I only bet when the odds are in my favor.」

「Huh? When are the odds ever in your favor?」I asked incredulously.

「It’s really quite easy,」he said.「I’m standing around a table, when some guy says, ‘It’s comin’ out nine! It’s gotta be a nine!’ The guy’s excited; he thinks it’s going to be a nine, and he wants to bet. Now I know the odds for all the numbers inside out, so I say to him, ‘I’ll bet you four to three it’s _not_ a nine,’ and I win in the long run. I don’t bet on the table; instead, I bet with people around the table who have prejudices–superstitious ideas about lucky numbers.」

Nick continued:「Now that I’ve got a reputation, it’s even easier, because people will bet with me even when they _know_ the odds aren’t very good, just to have the chance of telling the story, if they win, of how they beat Nick the Greek. So I really do make a living gambling, and it’s wonderful!」

So Nick the Greek was really an educated character. He was a very nice and engaging man. I thanked him for the explanation; now I understood it. I have to understand the world, you see.

———————— An Offer You Must Refuse ————————

Cornell had all kinds of departments that I didn’t have much interest in. (That doesn’t mean there was anything wrong with them; it’s just that I didn’t happen to have much interest in them.) There was domestic science, philosophy (the guys from this department were particularly inane), and there were the cultural things–music and so on. There were quite a few people I did enjoy talking to, of course. In the math department there was Professor Kac and Professor Feller; in chemistry, Professor Calvin; and a great guy in the zoology department, Dr. Griffin, who found out that bats navigate by making echoes. But it was hard to find enough of these guys to talk to, and there was all this other stuff which I thought was low-level baloney. And Ithaca was a small town.

The weather wasn’t really very good. One day I was driving in the car, and there came one of those quick snow flurries that you don’t expect, so you’re not ready for it, and you figure,「Oh, it isn’t going to amount to much; I’ll keep on going.」

But then the snow gets deep enough that the car begins to skid a little bit, so you have to put the chains on. You get out of the car, put the chains out on the snow, and it’s _cold_, and you’re beginning to shiver. Then you roll the car back onto the chains, and you have this problem–or we had it in those days; I don’t know what there is now–that there’s a hook on the inside that you have to hook first. And because the chains have to go on pretty tight, it’s hard to get the hook to hook. Then you have to push this clamp down with your fingers, which by this time are nearly frozen. And because you’re on the outside of the tire, and the hook is on the inside, and your hands are cold, it’s very difficult to control. It keeps slipping, and it’s _cold_, and the snow’s coming down, and you’re trying to push this clamp, and your hand’s hurting, and the damn thing’s not going down–well, I remember that _that_ was the _moment_ when I decided that _this_ is _insane_; there must be a part of the world that doesn’t have this problem.

I remembered the couple of times I had visited Caltech, at the invitation of Professor Bacher, who had previously been at Cornell. He was very smart when I visited. He knew me inside out, so he said,「Feynman, I have this extra car, which I’m gonna lend you. Now here’s how you go to Hollywood and the Sunset Strip. Enjoy yourself.」

So I drove his car every night down to the Sunset Strip–to the nightclubs and the bars and the action. It was the kind of stuff I liked from Las Vegas–pretty girls, big operators, and so on. So Bacher knew how to get me interested in Caltech.

You know the story about the donkey who is standing exactly in the middle of two piles of hay, and doesn’t go to either one, because it’s balanced? Well, that’s nothing. Cornell and Caltech started making me offers, and as soon as I would move, figuring that Caltech was really better, they would up their offer at Cornell; and when I thought I’d stay at Cornell, they’d up something at Caltech. So you can imagine this donkey between the two piles of hay, with the extra complication that as soon as he moves toward one, the other one gets higher. That makes it very difficult!

The argument that finally convinced me was my sabbatical leave. I wanted to go to Brazil again, this time for ten months, and I had just earned my sabbatical leave from Cornell. I didn’t want to lose that, so now that I had invented a reason to come to a decision, I wrote Bacher and told him what I had decided.

Caltech wrote back:「We’ll hire you immediately, and we’ll give you your first year as a sabbatical year.」That’s the way they were acting: no matter what I decided to do, they’d screw it up. So my first year at Caltech was really spent in Brazil. I came to Caltech to teach on my second year. That’s how it happened.

Now that I have been at Caltech since 1951, I’ve been very happy here. It’s _exactly_ the thing for a one-sided guy like me. There are all these people who are close to the top, who are very interested in what they are doing, and who I can talk to. So I’ve been very comfortable.

But one day, when I hadn’t been at Caltech very long, we had a bad attack of smog. It was worse then than it is now–at least your eyes smarted much more. I was standing on a corner, and my eyes were watering, and I thought to myself,「This is crazy! This is absolutely INSANE! It was all right back at Cornell. I’m getting out of here.」

So I called up Cornell, and asked them if they thought it was possible for me to come back. They said,「Sure! We’ll set it up and call you back tomorrow.」

The next day, I had the greatest luck in making a decision. God must have set it up to help me decide. I was walking to my office, and a guy came running up to me and said,「Hey, Feynman! Did you hear what happened? Baade found that there are two different populations of stars! All the measurements we had been making of the distances to the galaxies had been based on Cephid variables of _one_ type, but there’s _another_ type, so the universe is twice, or three, or even four times as old as we thought!」

I knew the problem. In those days, the earth appeared to be older than the universe. The earth was four and a half billion, and the universe was only a couple, or three billion years old. It was a great puzzle. And this discovery resolved all that: The universe was now demonstrably older than was previously thought. And I got this information right away– the guy came running up to me to tell me all this.

I didn’t even make it across the campus to get to my office, when _another_ guy came up–Matt Meselson, a biologist who had minored in physics. (I had been on his committee for his Ph.D.) He had built the first of what they call a density gradient centrifuge-it could measure the density of molecules. He said,「Look at the results of the experiment I’ve been doing!」

He had proved that when a bacterium makes a new one, there’s a whole molecule, intact, which is passed from one bacterium to another–a molecule we now know as DNA. You see, we always think of everything dividing, dividing. So we think _everything_ in the bacterium divides and gives half of it to the new bacterium. But that’s impossible: Somewhere, the smallest molecule that contains genetic information _can’t_ divide in half; it has to make a _copy_ of itself, and send one copy to the new bacterium, and keep one copy for the old one. And he had proved it in this way: He first grew the bacteria in heavy nitrogen, and later grew them all in ordinary nitrogen. As he went along, he weighed the molecules in his density gradient centrifuge.

The first generation of new bacteria had all of their chromosome molecules at a weight exactly in between the weight of molecules made with heavy, and molecules made with ordinary, nitrogen–a result that could occur if everything divided, including the chromosome molecules.

But in succeeding generations, when one might expect that the weight of the chromosome molecules would be one-fourth, one-eighth, and one-sixteenth of the difference between the heavy and ordinary molecules, the weights of the molecules fell into only two groups. One group was the same weight as the first new generation (halfway between the heavier and the lighter molecules), and the other group was lighter–the weight of molecules made in ordinary nitrogen. The _percentage_ of heavier molecules was cut in half in each succeeding generation, but not their weights. That was tremendously exciting, and very important–it was a fundamental discovery. And I realized, as I finally got to my office, that this is where I’ve got to be. Where people from all different fields of science would tell me stuff, and it was all exciting. It was exactly what I wanted, really.

So when Cornell called a little later, and said they were setting everything up, and it was nearly ready, I said,「I’m sorry, I’ve changed my mind again.」But I decided then _never_ to decide again. Nothing–absolutely nothing–would ever change my mind again.

When you’re young, you have all these things to worry about–should you go there, what about your mother. And you worry, and try to decide, but then something else comes up. It’s much easier to just plain _decide_. Never mind–_nothing_ is going to change your mind. I did that once when I was a student at MIT. I got sick and tired of having to decide what kind of dessert I was going to have at the restaurant, so I decided it would _always_ be chocolate ice cream, and never worried about it again–I had the solution to _that_ problem. Anyway, I decided it would always be Caltech.

One time someone tried to change my mind about Caltech. Fermi had just died a short time before, and the faculty at Chicago were looking for someone to take his place. Two people from Chicago came out and asked to visit me at my home–I didn’t know what it was about. They began telling me all the good reasons why I ought to go to Chicago: I could do this, I could do that, they had lots of great people there, I had the opportunity to do all kinds of wonderful things. I didn’t ask them how much they would pay, and they kept hinting that they would tell me if I asked. Finally, they asked me if I wanted to know the salary.「Oh, no!」I said.「I’ve already decided to stay at Caltech. My wife Mary Lou is in the other room, and if she hears how much the salary is, we’ll get into an argument. Besides, I’ve decided not to decide any more; I’m staying at Caltech for good.」So I didn’t let them tell me the salary they were offering.

About a month later I was at a meeting, and Leona Marshall came over and said,「It’s funny you didn’t accept our offer at Chicago. We were so disappointed, and we couldn’t understand how you could turn down such a terrific offer.」

「It was easy,」I said,「because I never let them tell me what the offer was.」

A week later I got a letter from her. I opened it, and the first sentence said,「The salary they were offering was–,」a _tremendous_ amount of money, three or four times what I was making. Staggering! Her letter continued,「I told you the salary before you could read any further. Maybe now you want to reconsider, because they’ve told me the position is still open, and we’d very much like to have you.」

So I wrote them back a letter that said,「After reading the salary, I’ve decided that I _must_ refuse. The reason I have to refuse a salary like that is I would be able to do what I’ve always wanted to do–get a wonderful mistress, put her up in an apartment, buy her nice things.. . With the salary you have offered, I could actually _do_ that, and I know what would happen to me. I’d worry about her, what she’s doing; I’d get into arguments when I come home, and so on. All this bother would make me uncomfortable and unhappy. I wouldn’t be able to do physics well, and it would be a _big mess!_ What I’ve always wanted to do would be bad for me, so I’ve decided that I can’t accept your offer.」

Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!

Part 5

The World of One Physicist

———————– Would _You_ Solve

the Dirac Equation? ———————–

Near the end of the year I was in Brazil I received a letter from Professor Wheeler which said that there was going to be an international meeting of theoretical physicists in Japan, and might I like to go? Japan had some famous physicists before the war–Professor Yukawa, with a Nobel prize, Tomonaga, and Nishina–but this was the first sign of Japan coming back to life after the war, and we all thought we ought to go and help them along.

Wheeler enclosed an army phrasebook and wrote that it would he nice if we would all learn a little Japanese. I found a Japanese woman in Brazil to help me with the pronunciation, I practiced lifting little pieces of paper with chopsticks, and I read a lot about Japan. At that time, Japan was very mysterious to me, and I thought it would be interesting to go to such a strange and wonderful country, so I worked very hard.

When we got there, we were met at the airport and taken to a hotel in Tokyo designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It was an imitation of a European hotel, right down to the little guy dressed in an outfit like the Philip Morris guy. We weren’t in Japan; we might as well have been in Europe or America! The guy who showed us to our rooms stalled around, pulling the shades up and down, waiting for a tip. Everything was just like America.

Our hosts had everything organized. That first night we were served dinner up at the top of the hotel by a woman dressed Japanese, but the menus were in English. I had gone to a lot of trouble to learn a few phrases in Japanese, so near the end of the meal, I said to the waitress,「_Kohi-o motte kite kudasai_.」She bowed and walked away.

My friend Marshak did a double take:「What? What?」

「I talk Japanese,」I said.

「Oh, you faker! You’re always kidding around, Feynman.」

「What are you talkin’ about?」I said, in a serious tone.

「OK,」he said.「What did you ask?」

「I asked her to bring us coffee.」

Marshak didn’t believe me.「I’ll make a bet with you,」he said.「If she brings us coffee.

The waitress appeared with our coffee, and Marshak lost his bet.

It turned out I was the only guy who had learned some Japanese–even Wheeler, who had told everybody they ought to learn Japanese, hadn’t learned any–and I couldn’t stand it any more. I had read about the Japanese-style hotels, which were supposed to be very different from the hotel we were staying in.

The next morning I called the Japanese guy who was organizing everything up to my room.「I would like to stay in a Japanese-style hotel.」

「I am afraid that it is impossible, Professor Feynman.」

I had read that the Japanese are very polite, but very obstinate: You have to keep working on them. So I decided to be as obstinate as they, and equally polite. It was a battle of minds: It took thirty minutes, back and forth.

「Why do you want to go to a Japanese-style hotel?」

「Because in this hotel, I don’t feel like I’m in Japan.」

「Japanese-style hotels are no good. You have to sleep on the floor.」

「That’s what I want; I want to see how it is.」

「And there are no chairs–you sit on the floor at the table.」

「It’s OK. That will be delightful. That’s what I’m looking for.」

Finally he owns up to what the situation is:「If you’re in another hotel, the bus will have to make an extra stop on its way to the meeting.」

「No, no!」I say.「In the morning, I’ll come to this hotel, and get on the bus here.」

「Well, then, OK. That’s fine.」That’s all there was to it–except it took half an hour to get to the real problem.

He’s walking over to the telephone to make a call to the other hotel when suddenly he stops; everything is blocked up again. It takes another fifteen minutes to discover that this time it’s the mail. If there are any messages from the meeting, they already have it arranged where to deliver them.

「It’s OK,」I say.「When I come in the morning to get the bus, I’ll look for any messages for me here at this hotel.」

「All right. That’s fine.」He gets on the telephone and at last we’re on our way to the Japanese-style hotel.

As soon as I got there, I knew it was worth it: It was so lovely! There was a place at the front where you take your shoes off, then a girl dressed in the traditional outfit–the obi–with sandals comes shuffling out, and takes your stuff; you follow her down a hallway which has mats on the floor, past sliding doors made of paper, and she’s going _cht-cht-cht-cht_ with little steps. It was all very wonderful!

We went into my room and the guy who arranged everything got all the way down, prostrated, and touched his nose to the floor; she got down and touched her nose to the floor. I felt very awkward. Should _I_ touch my nose to the floor, too?

They said greetings to each other, he accepted the room for me, and went out. It was a _really_ wonderful room. There were all the regular, standard things that you know of now, but it was all new to me. There was a little alcove with a painting in it, a vase with pussywillows nicely arranged, a table along the floor with a cushion nearby, and at the end of the room were two sliding doors which opened onto a garden.

The lady who was supposed to take care of me was a middle-aged woman. She helped me undress and gave me a _yukata_, a simple blue and white robe, to wear at the hotel.

I pushed open the doors and admired the lovely garden, and sat down at the table to do a little work.

I wasn’t there more than fifteen or twenty minutes when something caught my eye. I looked up, out towards the garden, and I saw, sitting at the entrance to the door, draped in the corner, a very beautiful young Japanese woman, in a most lovely outfit.

I had read a lot about the customs of Japan, and I had an idea of why she was sent to my room. I thought,「This might be very interesting!」

She knew a little English.「Would you rike to see the garden?」she asked.

I put on the shoes that went with the _yukata_ I was wearing, and we went out into the garden. She took my arm and showed me everything.

It turned out that because she knew a little English, the hotel manager thought I would like her to show me the garden–that’s all it was. I was a bit disappointed, of course, but this was a meeting of cultures, and I knew it was easy to get the wrong idea.

Sometime later the woman who took care of my room came in and said something–in Japanese–about a bath. I knew that Japanese baths were interesting and was eager to try it, so I said,「_Hai_.」

I had read that Japanese baths are very complicated. They use a lot of water that’s heated from the outside, and you aren’t supposed to get soap into the bathwater and spoil it for the next guy.

I got up and walked into the lavatory section, where the sink was, and I could hear some guy in the next section with the door closed, taking a bath. Suddenly the door slides open: the man taking the bath looks to see who is intruding.「Professor!」he says to me in English.「That’s a very bad error to go into the lavatory when someone else has the bath!」It was Professor Yukawa!

He told me that the woman had no doubt asked do I _want_ a bath, and if so, she would get it ready for me and tell me when the bathroom was free. But of all the people in the world to make that serious social error with, I was lucky it was Professor Yukawa!

That Japanese-style hotel was delightful, especially when people came to see me there. The other guys would come in to my room and we’d sit on the floor and start to talk. We wouldn’t be there more than five minutes when the woman who took care of my room would come in with a tray of candies and tea. It was as if you were a host in your own home, and the hotel staff was helping you to entertain your guests. Here, when you have guests at your hotel room, nobody cares; you have to call up for service, and so on.

Eating meals at the hotel was also different. The girl who brings in the food stays with you while you eat, so you’re not alone. I couldn’t have too good a conversation with her, but it was all right. And the food is wonderful. For instance, the soup comes in a bowl that’s covered. You lift the cover and there’s a beautiful picture: little pieces of onion floating in the soup just so; it’s gorgeous. How the food looks on the plate is very important.

I had decided that I was going to live Japanese as much as I could. That meant eating fish. I never liked fish when I was growing up, but I found out in Japan that it was a childish thing: I ate a lot of fish, and enjoyed it. (When I went back to the United States the first thing I did was go to a fish place. It was horrible–just like it was before. I couldn’t stand it. I later discovered the answer: The fish has to be very, very fresh–if it isn’t, it gets a certain taste that bothers me.)

One time when I was eating at the Japanese-style hotel I was served a round, hard thing, about the size of an egg yolk, in a cup of some yellow liquid. So far I had eaten everything in Japan, but this thing frightened me: it was all convoluted, like a brain looks. When I asked the girl what it was, she replied「_kuri_.」That didn’t help much. I figured it was probably an octopus egg, or something. I ate it, with some trepidation, because I wanted to he as much in Japan as possible. (I also remembered the word「_kuri_」as if my life depended on it–I haven’t forgotten it in thirty years.)

The next day I asked a Japanese guy at the conference what this convoluted thing was. I told him I had found it very difficult to eat. What the hell was「_kuri_」?

「It means ‘chestnut.’ 」he replied.

Some of the Japanese I had learned had quite an effect. One time, when the bus was taking a long time to get started, some guy says,「Hey, Feynman! You know Japanese; tell ‘em to get going!」

I said,「_Hayaku! Hayaku! Ikimasho! Ikimasho!_」–which means,「Let’s go! Let’s go! Hurry! Hurry!」

I realized my Japanese was out of control. I had learned these phrases from a military phrase book, and they must have been very rude, because everyone at the hotel began to scurry like mice, saying,「Yes, sir! Yes sir!」and the bus left right away.

The meeting in Japan was in two parts: one was in Tokyo, and the other was in Kyoto. In the bus on the way to Kyoto I told my friend Abraham Pais about the Japanese-style hotel, and he wanted to try it. We stayed at the Hotel Miyako, which had both American-style and Japanese-style rooms, and Pais shared a Japanese-style room with me.

The next morning the young woman taking care of our room fixes the bath, which was right in our room. Sometime later she returns with a tray to deliver breakfast. I’m partly dressed. She turns to me and says, politely,「_Ohayo, gozai masu_,」which means,「Good morning.」

Pais is just coming out of the bath, sopping wet and completely nude. She turns to him and with equal composure says,「_Ohayo, gozai masu_,」and puts the tray down for us.

Pais looks at me and says,「God, are we uncivilized!」

We realized that in America if the maid was delivering breakfast and the guy’s standing there, stark naked, there would be little screams and a big fuss. But in Japan they were completely used to it, and we felt that they were much more advanced and civilized about those things than we were.

I had been working at that time on the theory of liquid helium, and had figured out how the laws of quantum dynamics explain the strange phenomena of super-fluidity. I was very proud of this achievement, and was going to give a talk about my work at the Kyoto meeting.

The night before I gave my talk there was a dinner, and the man who sat down next to me was none other than Professor Onsager, a topnotch expert in solid-state physics and the problems of liquid helium. He was one of these guys who doesn’t say very much, but any time he said anything, it was significant.

「Well, Feynman,」he said in a gruff voice,「I hear you think you have understood liquid helium.」

「Well, yes..

「Hoompf.」And that’s all he said to me during the whole dinner! So that wasn’t much encouragement.

The next day I gave my talk and explained all about liquid helium. At the end, I complained that there was still something I hadn’t been able to figure out: that is, whether the transition between one phase and the other phase of liquid helium was first-order (like when a solid melts or a liquid boils–the temperature is constant) or second-order (like you see sometimes in magnetism, in which the temperature keeps changing).

Then Professor Onsager got up and said in a dour voice,「Well, Professor Feynman is new in our field, and I think he needs to be educated. There’s something he ought to know, and we should tell him.」

I thought,「Geesus! What did I do wrong?」

Onsager said,「We should tell Feynman that _nobody_ has ever figured out the order of _any_ transition correctly from first principles, so the fact that his theory does not allow him to work out the order correctly does _not_ mean that he hasn’t understood all the other aspects of liquid helium satisfactorily.」It turned out to be a compliment, but from the way he started out, I thought I was really going to get it!

It wasn’t more than a day later when I was in my room and the telephone rang. It was _Time_ magazine. The guy on the line said,「We’re very interested in your work. Do you have a copy of it you could send us?」

I had never been in _Time_ and was very excited. I was proud of my work, which had been received well at the meeting, so I said,「Sure!」

「Fine. Please send it to our Tokyo bureau.」The guy gave me the address. I was feeling great.

I repeated the address, and the guy said,「That’s right. Thank you very much, Mr. Pais.」

「Oh, no!」I said, startled.「I’m not Pais; it’s Pais you want? Excuse me, I’ll tell him that you want to speak to him when he comes back.」

A few hours later Pais came in:「Hey, Pais! Pais!」I said, in an excited voice.「_Time_ magazine called! They want you to send ‘em a copy of the paper you’re giving.」

「Aw!」he says.「Publicity is a whore!」

I was doubly taken aback.

I’ve since found out that Pais was right, but in those days, I thought it would be wonderful to have my name in _Time_ magazine.

That was the first time I was in Japan. I was eager to go back, and said I would go to any university they wanted me to. So the Japanese arranged a whole series of places to visit for a few days at a time.

By this time I was married to Mary Lou, and we were entertained wherever we went. At one place they put on a whole ceremony with dancing, usually performed only for larger groups of tourists, especially for us. At another place we were met right at the boat by all the students. At another place, the mayor met us.

One particular place we stayed was a little, modest place in the woods, where the emperor would stay when he came by. It was a very lovely place, surrounded by woods, just beautiful, the stream selected with care. It had a certain calmness, a quiet elegance. That the emperor would go to such a place to stay showed a greater sensitivity to nature, I think, than what we were used to in the West.

At all these places everybody working in physics would tell me what they were doing and I’d discuss it with them. They would tell me the general problem they were working on, and would begin to write a bunch of equations.

「Wait a minute,」I would say.「Is there a particular example of this general problem?」

「Why yes; of course.」

「Good. Give me one example.」That was for me: I can’t understand anything in general unless I’m carrying along in my mind a specific example and watching it go. Some people think in the beginning that I’m kind of slow and I don’t understand the problem, because I ask a lot of these「dumb」questions:「Is a cathode plus or minus? Is an an-ion this way, or that way?」

But later, when the guy’s in the middle of a bunch of equations, he’ll say something and I’ll say,「Wait a minute! There’s an error! That can’t be right!」

The guy looks at his equations, and sure enough, after a while, he finds the mistake and wonders,「How the hell did this guy, who hardly understood at the beginning, find that mistake in the mess of all these equations?」

He thinks I’m following the steps mathematically, but that’s not what I’m doing. I have the specific, physical example of what he’s trying to analyze, and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the thing. So when the equation says it should behave so-and-so, and I know that’s the wrong way around, I jump up and say,「Wait! There’s a mistake!」

So in Japan I couldn’t understand or discuss anybody’s work unless they could give me a physical example, and most of them couldn’t find one. Of those who could, it was often a weak example, one which could be solved by a much simpler method of analysis.

Since I was perpetually asking _not_ for mathematical equations, but for physical circumstances of what they were trying to work out, my visit was summarized in a mimeographed paper circulated among the scientists (it was a modest but effective system of communication they had cooked up after the war) with the title,「Feynman’s Bombardments, and Our Reactions.」

After visiting a number of universities I spent some months at the Yukawa Institute in Kyoto. I really enjoyed working there. Everything was so nice: You’d come to work, take your shoes off, and someone would come and serve you tea in the morning when you felt like it. It was very pleasant.

While in Kyoto I tried to learn Japanese with a vengeance. I worked much harder at it, and got to a point where I could go around in taxis and do things. I took lessons from a Japanese man every day for an hour.

One day he was teaching me the word for「see.」「All right,」he said.「You want to say, ‘May I see your garden?’ What do you say?」

I made up a sentence with the word that I had just learned.

「No, no!」he said.「When you say to someone, ‘Would you like to see my garden? you use the first ’see.’ But when you want to see someone else’s garden, you must use another ’see,’ which is more polite.」

「Would you like to _glance at_ my lousy garden?」is essentially what you’re saying in the first case, but when you want to look at the other fella’s garden, you have to say something like,「May I _observe_ your gorgeous garden?」So there’s two different words you have to use.

Then he gave me another one:「You go to a temple, and you want to look at the gardens . . .」

I made up a sentence, this time with the polite「see.」

「No, no!」he said.「In the temple, the gardens are much more elegant. So you have to say something that would be equivalent to ‘May I _hang my eyes_ on your most exquisite gardens?’」

Three or four different words for one idea, because when _I’m_ doing it, it’s miserable; when _you’re_ doing it, it’s elegant.

I was learning Japanese mainly for technical things, so I decided to check if this same problem existed among the scientists.

At the institute the next day, I said to the guys in the office,「How would I say in Japanese, ‘I solve the Dirac Equation’?」

They said such-and-so.

「OK. Now I want to say, ‘Would _you_ solve the Dirac Equation?’–how do I say that?」

「Well, you have to use a different word for ’solve,’「they say.

「Why?」I protested.「When _I_ solve it, I do the same damn thing as when _you_ solve it!」

「Well, yes, but it’s a different word–it’s more polite.」

I gave up. I decided that wasn’t the language for me, and stopped learning Japanese.

———————- The 7 Percent Solution ———————-

The problem was to find the right laws of beta decay. There appeared to be two particles, which were called a tan and a theta. They seemed to have almost exactly the same mass, but one disintegrated into two pions, and the other into three pions. Not only did they seem to have the same mass, but they also had the same lifetime, which is a funny coincidence. So everybody was concerned about this.

At a meeting I went to, it was reported that when these two particles were produced in a cyclotron at different angles and different energies, they were always produced in the same proportions–so many taus compared to so many thetas.

Now, one possibility, of course, was that it was the same particle, which sometimes decayed into two pions, and sometimes into three pions. But nobody would allow that, because there is a law called the parity rule, which is based on the assumption that all the laws of physics are mirror-imagesymmetrical, and says that a thing that can go into two pions can’t also go into three pions.

At that particular time I was not really quite up to things: I was always a little behind. Everybody seemed to be smart, and I didn’t feel I was keeping up. Anyway, I was sharing a room with a guy named Martin Block, an experimenter. And one evening he said to me,「Why are you guys so insistent on this parity rule? Maybe the tau and theta are the same particle. What would be the consequences if the parity rule were wrong?」

I thought a minute and said,「It would mean that nature’s laws are different for the right hand and the left hand, that there’s a way to define the right hand by physical phenomena. I don’t know that that’s so terrible, though there must be some bad consequences of that, but I don’t know. Why don’t you ask the experts tomorrow?」, -

He said,「No, they won’t listen to me. _You_ ask.」

So the next day, at the meeting, when we were discussing the tau-theta puzzle, Oppenheimer said,「We need to hear some new, wilder ideas about this problem.」

So I got up and said,「I’m asking this question for Martin Block: What would be the consequences if the parity rule was wrong?」

Murray Gell-Mann often teased me about this, saying I didn’t have the nerve to ask the question for myself. But that’s not the reason. I thought it might very well be an important idea.

Lee, of Lee and Yang, answered something complicated, and as usual I didn’t understand very well. At the end of the meeting, Block asked nie what he said, and I said I didn’t know, but as far as I could tell, it was still open–there was still a possibility. I didn’t think it was likely, but I thought it was possible.

Norm Ramsey asked me if I thought he should do an experiment looking for parity law violation, and I replied,「The best way to explain it is, I’ll bet you only fifty to one you don’t find anything.」

He said,「That’s good enough for me.」But he never did the experiment.

Anyway, the discovery of parity law violation was made, experimentally, by Wu, and this opened up a whole bunch of new possibilities for beta decay theory, It also unleashed a whole host of experiments immediately after that. Some showed electrons coming out of the nuclei spun to the left, and some to the right, and there were all kinds of experiments, all kinds of interesting discoveries about parity. But the data were so confusing that nobody could put things together.

At one point there was a meeting in Rochester–the yearly Rochester Conference. I was still always behind, and Lee was giving his paper on the violation of parity. He and Yang had come to the conclusion that parity was violated, and flow he was giving the theory for it.

During the conference I was staying with my sister in Syracuse. I brought the paper home and said to her,「I can’t understand these things that Lee and Yang are saying. It’s all so complicated.」

「No,」she said,「what you mean is _not_ that you can’t understand it, but that you didn’t _invent_ it. You didn’t figure it out your _own_ way, from hearing the clue. What you should do is imagine you’re a student again, and take this paper upstairs, read every line of it, and check the equations. Then you’ll understand it very easily.」

I took her advice, and checked through the whole thing, and found it to be very obvious and simple. I had been afraid to read it, thinking it was too difficult.

It reminded me of something I had done a long time ago with left and right unsymmetrical equations, Now it became kind of clear, when I looked at Lee’s formulas, that the solution to it all was much simpler: Everything comes out coupled to the left. For the electron and the muon, my predictions were the same as Lee’s, except I changed some signs around. I didn’t realize it at the time, but Lee had taken only the simplest example of muon coupling, and hadn’t proved that all muons would be full to the right, whereas according to my theory, all muons would have to be full automatically. Therefore, I had, in fact, a prediction on top of what he had. I had different signs, but I didn’t realize that I also had this quantity right.

I predicted a few things that nobody had experiments for yet, but when it came to the neutron and proton, I couldn’t make it fit well with what was then known about neutron and proton coupling: it was kind of messy.

The next day, when I went back to the meeting, a very kind man named Ken Case, who was going to give a paper on something, gave me five minutes of his allotted time to present my idea. I said I was convinced that everything was coupled to the left, and that the signs for the electron and muon are reversed, but I was struggling with the neutron. Later the experimenters asked me some questions about my predictions, and then I went to Brazil for the summer.

When I came back to the United States, I wanted to know what the situation was with beta decay. I went to Professor Wu’s laboratory at Columbia, and she wasn’t there, but another lady was there who showed me all kinds of data, all kinds of chaotic numbers that didn’t fit with anything. The electrons, which in my model would have all come out spinning to the left in the beta decay, came out on the right in some cases. Nothing fit anything.

When I got back to Caltech, I asked some of the experimenters what the situation was with beta decay. I remember three guys, Hans Jensen, Aaldert Wapstra, and Felix Boehm, sitting me down on a little stool, and starting to tell me all these facts: experimental results from other parts of the country, and their own experimental results. Since I knew those guys, and how careful they were, I paid more attention to their results than to the others. Their results, alone, were not so inconsistent; it was all the others _plus_ theirs.

Finally they get all this stuff into me, and they say,「The situation is so mixed up that even some of the things they’ve established for _years_ are being questioned–such as the beta decay of the neutron is S and T. It’s so messed up. Murray says it might even be V and A.」

I jump up from the stool and say,「Then I understand EVVVVVERYTHING!」

They thought I was joking. But the thing that I had trouble with at the Rochester meeting–the neutron and proton disintegration: everything fit _but_ that, and if it was V and A instead of S and T, _that_ would fit too. Therefore I had the whole theory!

That night I calculated all kinds of things with this theory. The first thing I calculated was the rate of disintegration of the muon and the neutron. They should be connected together, if this theory was right, by a certain relationship, and it was right to 9 percent. That’s pretty close, 9 percent. It should have been more perfect than that, hut it was close enough.

I went on and checked some other things, which fit, and new things fit, new things fit, and I was very excited. It was the first time, and the only time, in my career that I knew a law of nature that nobody else knew. (Of course it wasn’t true, but finding out later that at least Murray Gell-Mann–and also Sudarshan and Marshak–had worked out the same theory didn’t spoil my fun.)

The other things I had done before were to take somebody else’s theory and improve the method of calculating, or take an equation, such as the Schrodinger Equation, to explain a phenomenon, such as helium. We know the equation, and we know the phenomenon, but how does it work?

I thought about Dirac, who had his equation for a while–a new equation which told how an electron behaved– and I had this new equation for beta decay, which wasn’t as vital as the Dirac Equation, but it was good. It’s the only time I ever discovered a new law.

I called up my sister in New York to thank her for getting me to sit down and work through that paper by Lee and Yang at the Rochester Conference. After feeling uncomfortable and behind, now I was _in_; I had made a discovery, just from what she suggested. I was able to enter physics again, so to speak, and I wanted to thank her for that. I told her that everything fit, except for the 9 percent.

I was very excited, and kept on calculating, and things that fit kept on tumbling out: they fit automatically, without a strain. I had begun to forget about the 9 percent by now, because everything else was coming out right.

I worked very hard into the night, sitting at a small table in the kitchen next to a window. It was getting later and later–about 2:00 or 3:00 AM. I’m working hard, getting all these calculations packed solid with things that fit, and I’m thinking, and concentrating, and it’s dark, and it’s quiet . . . when suddenly there’s a TAC-TAC-TAC-TAC–loud, on the window. I look, and there’s this _white face_, right at the window, only inches away, and I _scream_ with shock and surprise!

It was a lady I knew who was angry at me because I had come back from vacation and didn’t immediately call her up to tell her I was back. I let her in, and tried to explain that I was just now very busy, that I had just discovered something, and it was very important. I said,「Please go out and let me finish it.」

She said,「No, I don’t want to bother you. I’ll just sit here in the living room.」

I said,「Well, all right, but it’s very difficult.」

She didn’t exactly sit in the living room. The best way to say it is she sort of squatted in a corner, holding her hands together, not wanting to「bother」me. Of course her purpose was to bother the _hell_ out of me! And she succeeded–I couldn’t ignore her. I got very angry and upset, and I couldn’t stand it. I had to do this calculating; I was making a big discovery and was terribly excited, and somehow, it was more important to me than this lady–at least at that moment. I don’t remember how I finally got her out of there, but it was very difficult.

After working some more, it got to be very late at night, and I was hungry. I walked up the maims street to a little restaurant five or ten blocks away, as I had often done before, late at night.

On early occasions I was often stopped by the police, because I would be walking along, thinking, and then I’d stop–sometimes an idea comes that’s difficult enough that you can’t keep walking; you have to make sure of something. So I’d stop, and sometimes I’d hold my hands out in the air, saying to myself,「The distance between these is that way, and then this would turn over _this_ way . . .」

I’d be moving my hands, standing in the street, when the police would come:「What is your name? Where do you live? What are you doing?」

「Oh! I was thinking. I’m sorry; I live here, and go often to the restaurant . . .」After a bit they knew who it was, and they didn’t stop me any more.

So I went to the restaurant, and while I’m eating I’m so excited that I tell a lady that I just made a discovery. She starts in: She’s the wife of a fireman, or forester, or something. She’s very lonely–all this stuff that I’m not interestedin. So _that_ happens.

The next morning when I got to work I went to Wapstra, Boehm, and Jensen, and told them,「I’ve got it all worked out. Everything fits.」

Christy, who was there, too, said,「What beta-decay constant did you use?」

「The one from So-and-So’s book.」

「But that’s been found out to be wrong. Recent measurements have shown it’s off by 7 percent.」

Then I remember the 9 percent. It was like a prediction for me: I went home and got this theory that says the neutron decay should be off by 9 percent, and they tell me the next _morning_ that, as a matter of fact, it’s 7 percent changed. But is it changed from 9 to 16, which is bad, or from 9 to 2, which is good?

Just then my sister calls from New York:「How about the 9 percent–what’s happened?」

「I’ve just discovered that there’s new data: 7 percent . . .」

「_Which way?_」

「I’m trying to find out. I’ll call you back.」

I was so excited that I couldn’t think. It’s like when you’re rushing for an airplane, and you don’t know whether you’re late or not, and you just can’t make it, when somebody says,「It’s daylight saving time!」Yes, but _which way?_ You can’t think in the excitement.

So Christy went into one room, and I went into another room, each of us to be quiet, so we could think it through: This moves _this_ way, and that moves _that_ way–it wasn’t very difficult, really; it’s just exciting.

Christy came out, and I came out, and we both agreed: It’s 2 percent, which is well within experimental error. After all, if they just changed the constant by 7 percent, the 2 percent could have been an error. I called my sister back:「Two percent.」The theory was right.

(Actually, it was wrong: it was off, really, by 1 percent, for a reason we hadn’t appreciated, which was only understood later by Nicola Cabibbo. So that 2 percent was not all experimental.)

Murray Gell-Mann compared and combined our ideas and wrote a paper on the theory. The theory was rather neat; it was relatively simple, and it fit a lot of stuff. But as I told you, there was an awful lot of chaotic data. And in some cases, we even went so far as to state that the experiments were in error.

A good example of this was an experiment by Valentine Telegdi, in which he measured the number of electrons that go out in each direction when a neutron disintegrates. Our theory had predicted that the number should be the same in all directions, whereas Telegdi found that 11 percent more came out in one direction than the others. Telegdi was an excellent experimenter, and very careful. And once, when he was giving a talk somewhere, he referred to our theory and said,「The trouble with theorists is, they never pay attention to the experiments!」

Telegdi also sent us a letter, which wasn’t exactly scathing, but nevertheless showed he was convinced that our theory was wrong. At the end he wrote,「The F-C (Feynman– Gell-Mann) theory of beta decay is no F-C.」

Murray says,「What should we do about this? You know, Telegdi’s pretty good.」

I say,「We just wait.」

Two days later there’s another letter from Telegdi. He’s a complete convert. He found out from our theory that he had disregarded the possibility that the proton recoiling from the neutron is not the same in all directions. He had assumed it was the same. By putting in corrections that our theory predicted instead of the ones _he_ had been using, the results straightened out and were in complete agreement.

I knew that Telegdi was excellent, and it would be hard to go upstream against him. But I was convinced by that time that something must be wrong with his experiment, and that _he_ would find it–he’s much better at finding it than we would he. That’s why I said we shouldn’t try to figure it out but just wait.

I went to Professor Bacher and told him about our success, and he said,「Yes, you come out and say that the neutron-proton coupling is V instead of T. Everybody used to think it was T. Where is the fundamental experiment that says it’s T? Why don’t you look at the early experiments and find out what was wrong with them?」

I went out and found the original article on the experiment that said the neutron-proton coupling is T, and I was _shocked_ by something. I remembered reading that article once before (back in the days when I read every article in the _Physical Review_–it was small enough). And I _remembered_, when I saw this article again, looking at that curve and thinking,「That doesn’t prove _anything!_」

You see, it depended on one or two points at the very edge of the range of the data, and there’s a principle that a point on the edge of the range of the data–the last point– isn’t very good, because if it was, they’d have another point further along. And I had realized that the whole idea that neutron-proton coupling is T was based on the last point, which wasn’t very good, and therefore it’s not proved. I remember _noticing_ that!

And when I became interested in beta decay, directly, I read all these reports by the「beta-decay experts,」which said it’s T. I never looked at the original data; I only read those reports, like a dope. Had I been a _good_ physicist, when I thought of the original idea back at the Rochester Conference I would have immediately looked up「how strong do we know it’s T?」–that would have been the sensible thing to do. I would have recognized right away that I had already _noticed_ it wasn’t satisfactorily proved.

Since then I never pay any attention to anything by「experts.」I calculate everything myself. When people said the quark theory was pretty good, I got two Ph. D.s, Finn Ravndal and Mark Kislinger, to go through the _whole works_ with me, just so I could check that the thing was really giving results that fit fairly well, and that it was a significantly good theory. I’ll never make that mistake again, reading the experts’ opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you.

————– Thirteen Times ————–

One time a science teacher from the local city college came around and asked me if I’d give a talk there. He offered me fifty dollars, but I told him I wasn’t worried about the money.「That’s the _city_ college, right?」

「Yes.」

I thought about how much paperwork I usually had to get involved with when I deal with the government, so I laughed and said,「I’ll be glad to give the talk. There’s only one condition on the whole thing」–I pulled a number out of a hat and continued–「that I don’t have to sign my name more than thirteen times, and that includes the check!」

The guy laughs too.「Thirteen times! No problem.」

So then it starts. First I have to sign something that says I’m loyal to the government, or else I can’t talk in the city college. And I have to sign it double, OK? Then I have to sign some kind of release to the city–I can’t remember what. Pretty soon the numbers are beginning to climb up.

I have to sign that I was suitably employed as a professor– to ensure, of course, since it’s a city thing, that no jerk at the other end was hiring his wife or a friend to come and not even give the lecture. There were all kinds of things to ensure, and the signatures kept mounting.

Well, the guy who started out laughing got pretty nervous, but we just made it. I signed exactly twelve times. There was one more left for the check, so I went ahead and gave the talk.

A few days later the guy came around to give me the check, and he was really sweating. He couldn’t give me the money unless I signed a form saying I really gave the talk.

I said,「If I sign the form, I can’t sign the check. But _you_ were there. You heard the talk; why don’t _you_ sign it?」

「Look,」he said,「Isn’t this whole thing rather silly?」

「No. It was an arrangement we made in the beginning. We didn’t think it was really going to get to thirteen, hut we agreed on it, and I think we should stick to it to the end.」

He said,「I’ve been working very hard, calling all around. I’ve been trying _everything_, and they tell me it’s impossible. You simply can’t get your money unless you sign the form.」

「It’s OK,」I said.「I’ve only signed twelve times, and I gave the talk. I don’t need the money.」

「But I hate to _do_ this to you.」

「It’s all right. We made a deal; don’t worry.」

The next day he called me up.「They can’t _not_ give you the money! They’ve already earmarked the money and they’ve got it set aside, so they _have_ to give it to you!」

「OK, if they have to give me the money, let them give me the money.」

「But you have to sign the form.」

「I won’t sign the form!」

They were stuck. There was no miscellaneous pot which was for money that this man deserves but won’t sign for.

Finally, it got straightened out. It took a long time, and it was very complicated–but I used the thirteenth signature to cash my check.

———————- It Sounds Greek to Me! ———————-

I don’t know why, but I’m always very careless, when I go on a trip, about the address or telephone number or anything of the people who invited me. I figure I’ll be met, or somebody else will know where we’re going; it’ll get straightened out somehow.

One time, in 1957, I went to a gravity conference at the University of North Carolina. I was supposed to be an expert in a different field who looks at gravity.

I landed at the airport a day late for the conference (I couldn’t make it the first day), and I went out to where the taxis were. I said to the dispatcher,「I’d like to go to the University of North Carolina.」

「Which do you mean,」he said,「the State University of North Carolina at Raleigh, or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill?」

Needless to say, I hadn’t the slightest idea.「Where are they?」I asked, figuring that one must be near the other.

「One’s north of here, and the other is south of here, about the same distance.」

I had nothing with me that showed which one it was, and there was nobody else going to the conference a day late like I was.

That gave me an idea.「Listen,」I said to the dispatcher.「The main meeting began yesterday, so there were a whole lot of guys going to the meeting who must have come through here yesterday. Let me describe them to you: They would have their heads kind of in the air, and they would he talking to each other, not paying attention to where they were going, saying things to each other, like ‘G-mu-nu. G-mu-nu.’」

His face lit up.「Ah, yes,」he said.「You mean Chapel Hill!」He called the next taxi waiting in line.「Take this man to the university at Chapel Hill.」

「Thank you,」I said, and I went to the conference.

————– But Is It Art? ————–

Once I was at a party playing bongos, and I got going pretty well. One of the guys was particularly inspired by the drumming. He went into the bathroom, took off his shirt, smeared shaving cream in funny designs all over his chest, and came out dancing wildly, with cherries hanging from his ears. Naturally, this crazy nut and I became good friends right away. His name is Jirayr Zorthian; he’s an artist.

We often had long discussions about art and science. I’d say things like,「Artists are lost: they don’t have any subject! They used to have the religious subjects, but they lost their religion and now they haven’t got anything. They don’t understand the technical world they live in; they don’t know anything about the beauty of the _real_ world–the scientific world–so they don’t have anything in their hearts to paint.」

Jerry would reply that artists don’t need to have a physical subject; there are many emotions that can he expressed through art. Besides, art can be abstract. Furthermore, scientists destroy the beauty of nature when they pick it apart and turn it into mathematical equations.

One time I was over at Jerry’s for his birthday, and one of these dopey arguments lasted until 3:00 AM. The next morning I called him up:「Listen, Jerry,」I said,「the reason we have these arguments that never get anywhere is that you don’t know a damn thing about science, and I don’t know a damn thing about art. So, on alternate Sundays, I’ll give you a lesson in science, and you give me a lesson in art.」

「OK,」he said.「I’ll teach you how to draw.」

「That will he _impossible_,」I said, because when I was in high school, the only thing I could draw was pyramids on deserts–consisting mainly of straight lines–and from time to time I would attempt a palm tree and put in a sun. I had absolutely no talent. I sat next to a guy who was equally adept. When he was permitted to draw anything, it consisted of two flat, elliptical blobs, like tires stacked on one another, with a stalk coming out of the top, culminating in a green triangle. It was supposed to be a tree. So I bet Jerry that he wouldn’t be able to teach me to draw.

「Of course you’ll have to work,」he said.

I promised to work, but still bet that he couldn’t teach me to draw. I wanted very much to learn to draw, for a reason that I kept to myself: I wanted to convey an emotion I have about the beauty of the world. It’s difficult to describe because it’s an emotion. It’s analogous to the feeling one has in religion that has to do with a god that controls everything in the whole universe: there’s a generality aspect that you feel when you think about how things that appear so different and behave so differently are all run「behind the scenes」by the same organization, the same physical laws. It’s an appreciation of the mathematical beauty of nature, of how she works inside; a realization that the phenomena we see result from the complexity of the inner workings between atoms; a feeling of how dramatic and wonderful it is. It’s a feeling of awe–of scientific awe–which I felt could be communicated through a drawing to someone who had also had this emotion. It could remind him, for a moment, of this feeling about the glories of the universe.

Jerry turned out to be a very good teacher. He told me first to go home and draw anything. So I tried to draw a shoe; then I tried to draw a flower in a pot. It was a mess!

The next time we met I showed him my attempts:「Oh, look!」he said.「You see, around in back here, the line of the flower pot doesn’t touch the leaf.」(I had meant the line to come up to the leaf.)「That’s very good. It’s a way of showing depth. That’s very clever of you.」

「And the fact that you don’t make all the lines the same thickness (which I _didn’t_ mean to do) is good. A drawing with all the lines the same thickness is dull.」It continued like that: Everything that I thought was a mistake, he used to teach me something in a positive way. He never said it was wrong; he never put me down. So I kept on trying, and I gradually got a little bit better, but I was never satisfied.

To get more practice I also signed up for a correspondence school course, with International Correspondence Schools, and I must say they were good. They started me off drawing pyramids and cylinders, shading them and so on. We covered many areas: drawing, pastels, watercolors, and paints. Near the end I petered out: I made an oil painting for them, but I never sent it in. They kept sending me letters urging me to continue. They were very good.

I practiced drawing all the time, and became very interested in it. If I was at a meeting that wasn’t getting anywhere– like the one where Carl Rogers came to Caltech to discuss with us whether Caltech should develop a psychology department–I would draw the other people. I had a little pad of paper I kept with me and I practiced drawing wherever I went. So, as Jerry taught me, I worked very hard.

Jerry, on the other hand, didn’t learn much physics. His mind wandered too easily. I tried to teach him something about electricity and magnetism, but as soon as I mentioned electricity,」he’d tell me about some motor he had that didn’t work, and how might he fix it. When I tried to show him how an electromagnet works by making a little coil of wire and hanging a nail on a piece of string, I put the voltage on, the nail swung into the coil, and Jerry said,「Ooh! It’s just like fucking!」So that was the end of that.

So now we have a new argument–whether he’s a better teacher than I was, or I’m a better student than he was.

I gave up the idea of trying to get an artist to appreciate the feeling I had about nature so _he_ could portray it. I would flow have to double my efforts in learning to draw so I could do it myself. It was a very ambitious undertaking, and I kept the idea entirely to myself, because the odds were I would never be able to do it.

Early on in the process of learning to draw, some lady I knew saw my attempts and said,「You should go down to the Pasadena Art Museum. They have drawing classes there, with models–nude models.」

「No,」I said;「I can’t draw well enough: I’d feel very embarrassed.」

「You’re good enough; you should see some of the others!」

So I worked up enough courage to go down there. In the first lesson they told us about newsprint–very large sheets of low-grade paper, the size of a newspaper–and the various kinds of pencils and charcoal to get. For the second class a model came, and she started off with a ten-minute pose.

I started to draw the model, and by the time I’d done one leg, the ten minutes were up. I looked around and saw that everyone else had already drawn a complete picture, with shading in the back–the whole business.

I realized I was way out of my depth. But finally at the end, the model was going to pose for thirty minutes. I worked very hard, and with great effort I was able to draw her whole outline. This time there was half a hope. So this time I didn’t cover up my drawing, as I had done with all the previous ones.

We went around to look at what the others had done, and I discovered what they could _really_ do: they draw the model, with details and shadows, the pocketbook that’s on the bench she’s sitting on, the platform, everything! They’ve all gone _zip, zip, zip, zip, zip_ with the charcoal, all over, and I figure it’s hopeless–utterly hopeless.

I go back to cover up my drawing, which consists of a few lines crowded into the upper left-hand corner of the newsprint–I had, until then, only been drawing on 8½ X 11 paper–but some others in the class are standing nearby: Oh, look at this one,」one of them says.「Every line counts!」I didn’t know what that meant, exactly, but I felt encouraged enough to come to the next class. In the meantime, Jerry kept telling me that drawings that are too full aren’t any good. His job was to teach me not to worry about the others, so he’d tell me they weren’t so hot.

I noticed that the teacher didn’t tell people much (the only thing he told me was my picture was too small on the page). Instead, he tried to inspire us to experiment with new approaches. I thought of how we teach physics: We have so many techniques–so many mathematical methods–that we never stop telling the students how to do things. On the other hand, the drawing teacher is afraid to tell you anything. If your lines are very heavy, the teacher can’t say,「Your lines are too heavy,」because _some_ artist has figured out a way of making great pictures using heavy lines. The teacher doesn’t want to push you in some particular direction. So the drawing teacher has this problem of communicating how to draw by osmosis and not by instruction, while the physics teacher has the problem of always teaching techniques, rather than the spirit, of how to go about solving physical Problems.

They were always telling me to「loosen up,」to become more relaxed about drawing. I figured that made no more sense than telling someone who’s just learning to drive to「loosen up」at the wheel. It isn’t going to work. Only after you know how to do it carefully can you begin to loosen up. So I resisted this perennial loosen-up stuff.

One exercise they had invented for loosening us up was to draw without looking at the paper. Don’t take your eyes off the model; just look at her and make the lines on the paper without looking at what you’re doing.

One of the guys says,「I can’t help it. I have to cheat. I bet everybody’s cheating!」

「_I’m_ not cheating!」I say.

「Aw, baloney!」they say.

I finish the exercise and they come over to look at what I had drawn. They found that, indeed, I was NOT cheating; at the very beginning my pencil point had busted, and there was nothing hut impressions on the paper.

When I finally got my pencil to work, I tried it again. I found that my drawing had a kind of strength–a funny, semi-Picasso-like strength–which appealed to me. The reason I felt good al)out that drawing was, I knew it was impossible to draw well that way, and therefore it didn’t have to he good–and that’s really what the loosening up was all about. I had thought that「loosen up」meant「make sloppy drawings,」but it really meant to relax and riot worry about how the drawing is going to come out.

I made a lot of progress in the class, and I was feeling pretty good. Up until the last session, all the models we had were rather heavy and out of shape; they were rather interesting to draw. But in the last class we had a model who was a nifty blonde, perfectly proportioned. It was then that I discovered that I still didn’t know how to draw: I couldn’t make anything come out that looked anything _like_ this beautiful girl! With the other models, if you draw something a little too big or bit too small, it doesn’t make any difference because it’s all out of shape anyway. But when you’re trying to draw something that’s so well put together, you can’t fool yourself: It’s got to be just right!

During one of the breaks I overheard a guy who could _really_ draw asking this model whether she posed privately. She said yes.「Good. But I don’t have a studio yet. I’ll have to work that out first.」

I figured I could learn a lot from this guy, and I’d never get another chance to draw this nifty model unless I did something.「Excuse me,」I said to him,「I have a room downstairs in my house that could be used as a studio.」

They both agreed. I took a few of the guy’s drawings to my friend Jerry, but he was aghast.「Those aren’t so good,」he said. He tried to explain why, but I never really understood.

Until I began to learn to draw, I was never much interested in looking at art. I had very little appreciation for things artistic, and only very rarely, such as once when I was in a museum in Japan. I saw a painting done on brown paper of bamboo, and what was beautiful about it to me was that it was perfectly poised between being just some brush strokes and being bamboo–I could make it go back and forth.

The summer after the drawing class I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I’d like to see the Sistine Chapel. I got there very early in the morning, bought my ticket before anybody else, and _ran_ up the stairs as soon as the place opened. I therefore had the unusual pleasure of looking at the whole chapel for a moment, in silent awe, before anybody else came in.

Soon the tourists came, and there were crowds of people milling around, talking different languages, pointing at this and that. I’m walking around, looking at the ceiling for a while. Then my eye came down a little bit and I saw some big, framed pictures, and I thought,「Gee! I never knew about these!」

Unfortunately I’d left my guidebook at the hotel, but I thought to myself,「I know why these panels aren’t famous; they aren’t any good.」But then I looked at another one, and I said,「Wow! That’s a _good one_.」I looked at the others.「That’s good too, so is that one, but that one’s lousy.」I had never heard of these panels, but I decided that they were all good except for two.

I went into a place called the Sala de Raphael–the Raphael Room–and I noticed the same phenomenon. I thought to myself,「Raphael is irregular. He doesn’t always succeed. Sometimes he’s very good. Sometimes it’s just junk.」

When I got back to my hotel, I looked at the guidebook. In the part about the Sistine Chapel:「Below the paintings by Michelangelo there are fourteen panels by Botticelli, Perugino」–all these great artists–「and two by So-and-so, which are of no significance.」This was a terrific excitement to me, that I also could tell the difference between a beautiful work of art and one that’s not, without being able to define it. As a scientist you always think you know what you’re doing, so you tend to distrust the artist who says,「It’s great,」or「It’s no good,」and then is not able to explain to you why, as Jerry did with those drawings I took him. But here I was, sunk: I could do it too!

In the Raphael Room the secret turned out to be that only some of the paintings were made by the great master; the rest were made by students. I had liked the ones by Raphael. This was a big jab for my self-confidence in my ability to appreciate art.

Anyway, the guy from the art class and the nifty model came over to my house a number of times and I tried to draw her and learn from him. After many attempts I finally drew what I felt was a really nice picture–it was a portrait of her head–and I got very excited about this first success.

I had enough confidence to ask an old friend of mine named Steve Demitriades if his beautiful wife would pose for me, and in return I would give him the portrait. He laughed.「If she wants to waste her time posing for you, it’s all right with me, ha, ha, ha.」

I worked very hard on her portrait, and when he saw it, he turned over to my side completely:「It’s _just wonderful!_」he exclaimed.「Can you get a photographer to make copies of it? I want to send one to my mother in Greece!」His mother had never seen the girl he married. That was very exciting to me, to think that I had improved to the point where someone wanted one of my drawings.

A similar thing happened at a small art exhibit that some guy at Caltech had arranged, where I contributed two drawings and a painting. He said,「We oughta put a price on the drawings.」

I thought,「That’s silly! I’m not trying to sell them.」

「It makes the exhibition more interesting. If you don’t mind parting with them, just put a price on.」

After the show the guy told me that a girl had bought one of my drawings and wanted to speak to me to find out more about it.

The drawing was called「The Magnetic Field of the Sun.」For this particular drawing I had borrowed one of those beautiful pictures of the solar prominences taken at the solar laboratory in Colorado. Because I understood how the sun’s magnetic field was holding up the flames and had, by that time, developed some technique for drawing magnetic field lines (it was similar to a girl’s flowing hair), I wanted to draw something beautiful that no artist would think to draw: the rather complicated and twisting lines of the magnetic field, close together here and spreading out there.

I explained all this to her, and showed her the picture that gave me the idea.

She told me this story: She and her husband had gone to the exhibit, and they both liked the drawing very much.「Why don’t we buy it?」she suggested.

Her husband was the kind of a man who could never do anything right away.「Let’s think about it a while,」he said.

She realized his birthday was a few months ahead, so she went back the same day and bought it herself.

That night when he came home from work, he was depressed. She finally got it out of him: He thought it would be nice to buy her that picture, but when he went back to the exhibit, he was told that the picture had already been sold. So she had it to surprise him on his birthday.

What _I_ got out of that story was something still very new to me: I understood at last what art is really for, at least in certain respects. It gives somebody, individually, pleasure. You can make something that somebody likes _so much_ that they’re depressed, or they’re happy, on account of that damn thing you made! In science, it’s sort of general and large: You don’t know the individuals who have appreciated it directly.

I understood that to sell a drawing is not to make money, but to be sure that it’s in the home of someone who really wants it; someone who would feel bad if they didn’t have it. This was interesting.

So I decided to sell my drawings. However, I didn’t want people to buy my drawings because the professor of physics isn’t supposed to be able to draw, isn’t that wonderful, so I made up a false name. My friend Dudley Wright suggested「Au Fait,」which means「It is done」in French. I spelled it O-f-e-y, which turned out to be a name the blacks used for「whitey.」But after all, I was whitey, so it was all right.

One of my models wanted me to make a drawing for her, but she didn’t have the money. (Models don’t have money; if they did, they wouldn’t be modeling.) She offered to pose three times free if I would give her a drawing.

「On the contrary,」I said.「I’ll give you three drawings if you’ll pose once for nothing.」

She put one of the drawings I gave her on the wall in her small room, and soon her boyfriend noticed it. He liked it so much that he wanted to commission a portrait of her. He would pay me sixty dollars. (The money was getting pretty good now.)

Then she got the idea to be my agent: She could earn a little extra money by going around selling my drawings, saying,「There’s a new artist in Altadena . . .」It was _fun_ to be in a different world! She arranged to have some of my drawings put on display at Bullock’s, Pasadena’s most elegant department store. She and the lady from the art section picked out some drawings–drawings of plants that I had made early on (that I didn’t like)–and had them all framed. Then I got a signed document from Bullock’s saying that they had such-and-such drawings on consignment. Of course nobody bought _any_ of them, but otherwise I was a big success: I had my drawings on sale at Bullock’s! It was fun to have them there, just so I could say one day that I had reached that pinnacle of success in the art world.

Most of my models I got through Jerry, but I also tried to get models on my own. Whenever I met a young woman who looked as if she would be interesting to draw, I would ask her to pose for me. It always ended up that I would draw her face, because I didn’t know exactly how to bring up the subject of posing nude.

Once when I was over at Jerry’s, I said to his wife Dabney,「I can never get the girls to pose nude: I don’t know how Jerry does it!」

「Well, did you ever _ask_ them?」

「Oh! I never thought of that.」

The next girl I met that I wanted to pose for me was a Caltech student. I asked her if she would pose nude.「Certainly,」she said, and there we were! So it was easy. I guess there was so much in the back of my mind that I thought it was somehow wrong to ask.

I’ve done a lot of drawing by now, and I’ve gotten so I like to draw nudes best. For all I know it’s not art, exactly; it’s a mixture. Who knows the percentages?

One model I met through Jerry had been a _Playboy_ playmate. She was tall and gorgeous. However, she thought she was _too_ tall. Every girl in the world, looking at her, would have been jealous. When she would come into a room, she’d be half stooped over. I tried to teach her, when she was posing, to _please stand up_, because she was so elegant and striking. I finally talked her into that.

Then she had another worry: she’s got「dents」near her groin. I had to get out a book of anatomy to show her that it’s the attachment of the muscles to the ilium, and to explain to her that you can’t see these dents on everybody; to see them, everything must be jqust right, in perfect proportion, like she was. I learned from her that every woman is worried about her looks, no matter how beautiful she is.

I wanted to draw a picture of this model in color, in pastels, just to experiment. I thought I would first make a sketch in charcoal, which would be later covered with the pastel. When I got through with this charcoal drawing that I had made without worrying how it was going to look, I realized that it was one of the best drawings I had ever made. I decided to leave it, and forget about the pastels for that one.

My「agent」looked at it and wanted to take it around.

「You can’t sell that,」I said,「it’s on newsprint.」

「Oh, never mind,」she said.

A few weeks later she came back with this picture in a beautiful wooden frame with a red band and a gold edge. It’s a funny thing which must make artists, generally, unhappy– how much improved a drawing gets when you put a frame around it. My agent told me that a particular lady got all excited about the drawing and they took it to a picture framer. He told them that there were special techniques for mounting drawings on newsprint: Impregnate it with plastic, do this, do that. So this lady goes to all that trouble over this drawing I had made, and then has my agent bring it back to me.「I think the artist would like to see how lovely it is, framed,」she said.

I certainly did. There was another example of the direct pleasure somebody got out of one of my pictures. So it was a real kick selling the drawings.

There was a period when there were topless restaurants in town: You could go there for lunch or dinner, and the girls would dance without a top, and after a while without anything. One of these places, it turned out, was only a mile and a half away from my house, so I went there very often. I’d sit in one of the booths and work a little physics on the paper placemats with the scalloped edges, and sometimes I’d draw one of the dancing girls or one of the customers, just to practice.

My wife Gweneth, who is English, had a good attitude about my going to this place. She said,「The Englishmen have clubs they go to.」So it was something like my club.

There were pictures hanging around the place, but I didn’t like them much. They were these fluorescent colors on black velvet–kind of ugly–a girl taking off her sweater, or something. Well, I had a rather nice drawing I had made of my model Kathy, so I gave it to the owner of the restaurant to put up on the wall, and he was delighted.

Giving him the drawing turned out to produce some useful results. The owner became very friendly to me, and would give me free drinks all the time. Now, every time I would come in to the restaurant a waitress would come over with my free 7-Up. I’d watch the girls dance, do a little physics, prepare a lecture, or draw a little bit. If I got a little tired, I’d watch the entertainment for a while, and then do a little more work. The owner knew I didn’t want to be disturbed, so if a drunk man came over and started to talk to me, right away a waitress would come and get the guy out of there. If a girl came over, he would do nothing. We had a very good relationship. His name was Gianonni.

The other effect of my drawing on display was that people would ask him about it. One day a guy came over to me and said,「Gianonni tells me you made that picture.」

「Yeah.」

「Good. I’d like to commission a drawing.」

「All right; what would you like?」

「I want a picture of a nude toreador girl being charged by a hull with a man’s head.」

「Well, uh, it would help me a little if I had some idea of what this drawing is for.」

「I want it for my business establishment.」

「What kind of business establishment?」

「It’s for a massage parlor: you know, private rooms, masseuses–get the idea?」

「Yeah, I get the idea.」I didn’t want to draw a nude toreador girl being charged by a bull with a man’s head, so I tried to talk him out of it.「How do you think that looks to the customers, and how does it make the girls feel? The men come in there and you get ‘em all excited with this picture. Is that the way you want ‘em to treat the girls?」

He’s not convinced.

「Suppose the cops come in and they see this picture, and you’re claiming it’s a massage parlor.」

「OK, OK,」he says;「You’re right. I’ve gotta change it. What I want is a picture that, if the cops look at it, is perfectly OK for a massage parlor, but if a customer looks at it, it gives him ideas.」

「OK,」I said. We arranged it for sixty dollars, and I began to work on the drawing. First, I had to figure out how to do it. I thought and I thought, and I often felt I would have been better off drawing the nude toreador girl in the first place!

Finally I figured out how to do it: I would draw a slave girl in imaginary Rome, massaging some important Roman–a senator, perhaps. Since she’s a slave girl, she has a certain look on her face. She knows what’s going to happen next, and she’s sort of resigned to it.

I worked very hard on this picture. I used Kathy as the model. Later, I got another model for the man. I did lots of studies, and soon the cost for the models was already eighty dollars. I didn’t care about the money; I liked the challenge of having to do a commission. Finally I ended up with a picture of a muscular man lying on a table with the slave girl massaging him: she’s wearing a kind of toga that covers one breast–the other one was nude–and I got the expression of resignation on her face just right.

I was just about ready to deliver my commissioned masterpiece to the massage parlor when Gianonni told me that the guy had been arrested and was in jail. So I asked the girls at the topless restaurant if they knew any good massage parlors around Pasadena that would like to hang my drawing in the lobby.

They gave me names and locations of places in and around Pasadena and told me things like「When you go to the Such-and-such massage parlor, ask for Frank–he’s a pretty good guy. If he’s not there, don’t go in.」Or「Don’t talk to Eddie. Eddie would never understand the value of a drawing.」

The next day I rolled up my picture, put it in the back of my station wagon, and my wife Gweneth wished me good luck as I set out to visit the brothels of Pasadena to sell my drawing.

Just before I went to the first place on my list, I thought to myself,「You know, before I go anywhere else, I oughta check at the place he used to have. Maybe it’s still open, and perhaps the new manager wants my drawing.」I went over there and knocked on the door. It opened a little bit, and I saw a girl’s eye.「Do we know you?」she asked.

「No, you don’t, hut how would you like to have a drawing that would he appropriate for your entrance hall?」

「I’m sorry,」she said,「but we’ve already contracted an artist to make a drawing for us, and he’s working on it.」

「I’m the artist,」I said,「and your drawing is ready!」

It turns out that the guy, as he was going to jail, told his wife about our arrangement. So I went in and showed them the drawing.

The guy’s wife and his sister, who were now running the place, were not entirely pleased with it; they wanted the girls to see it. I hung it up on the wall, there in the lobby, and all the girls came out from the various rooms in the back and started to make comments.

One girl said she didn’t like the expression on the slave girl’s face.「She doesn’t look happy,」she said.「She should be smiling.」

I said to her,「Tell me–while you’re massaging a guy, and he’s not lookin’ at you, are you smiling?」

「Oh, no!」she said.「I feel exactly like she looks! But it’s not right to put it in the picture.」

I left it with them, but after a week of worrying about it back and forth, they decided they didn’t want it. It turned out that the real reason that they didn’t want it was the one nude breast. I tried to explain that my drawing was a tone-down of the original request, hut they said they had different ideas about it than the guy did. I thought the irony of people running such an establishment being prissy about one nude breast was amusing, and I took the drawing home.

My businessman friend Dudley Wright saw the drawing and I told him the story about it. He said,「You oughta triple its price. With art, nobody is really sure of its value, so people often think, ‘If the price is higher, it must be more valuable!’」

I said,「You’re crazy!」hut, just for fun, I bought a twenty-dollar frame and mounted the drawing so it would be ready for the next customer.

Some guy from the weather forecasting business saw the drawing I had given Gianonni and asked if I had others. I invited him and his wife to my「studio」downstairs in my home, and they asked about the newly framed drawing.「That one is two hundred dollars.」(I had multiplied sixty by three and added twenty for the frame.) The next day they came back and bought it. So the massage parlor drawing ended up in the office of a weather forecaster.

One day there was a police raid on Gianonni’s, and some of the dancers were arrested. Someone wanted to stop Gianonni from putting on topless dancing shows, and Gianonni didn’t want to stop. So there was a big court case about it; it was in all the local papers.

Gianonni went around to all the customers and asked them if they would testify in support of him. Everybody had an excuse:「I run a day camp, and if the parents see that I’m going to this place, they won’t send their kids to my camp . . .」

Or,「I’m in the such-and-such business, and if it’s publicized that I come down here, we’ll lose customers.」

I think to myself,「I’m the only free man in here. I haven’t any excuse! I _like_ this place, and I’d like to see it continue. I don’t see anything wrong with topless dancing.」So I said to Gianonni,「Yes, I’ll he glad to testify.」

In court the big question was, is topless dancing acceptable to the community–do community standards allow it?

The lawyer from the defense tried to make me into an expert on community standards. He asked me if I went into other bars.

「Yes.」

「And how many times per week would you typically go to Gianonni’s?」

「Five, six times a week.」(That got into the papers: The Caltech professor of physics goes to see topless dancing six times a week.)

「What sections of the community were represented at Gianonni’s?」

「Nearly every section: there were guys from the real estate business, a guy from the city governing board, workmen from the gas station, guys from engineering firms, a professor of physics

「So would you say that topless entertainment is acceptable to the community, given that so many sections of it are watching it and enjoying it?」

「I need to know what you mean by ‘acceptable to the community.’ Nothing is accepted by _everybody_, so what _percentage_ of the community must accept something in order for it to be ‘acceptable to the community’?」

The lawyer suggests a figure. The other lawyer objects. The judge calls a recess, and they all go into chambers for 15 minutes before they can decide that「acceptable to the community」means accepted by 50% of the community.

In spite of the fact that I made them be precise, I had no precise numbers as evidence, so I said,「I believe that topless dancing is accepted by more than 50% of the community, and is therefore acceptable to the community.」

Gianonni temporarily lost the case, and his, or another one very similar to it, went ultimately to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, his place stayed open, and I got still more free 7-Ups.

Around that time there were some attempts to develop an interest in art at Caltech. Somebody contributed the money to convert an old plant sciences building into some art studios. Equipment and supplies were bought and provided for the students, and they hired an artist from South Africa to coordinate and support the art activities around Caltech.

Various people came in to teach classes. I got Jerry Zorthian to teach a drawing class, and some guy came in to teach lithography, which I tried to learn.

The South African artist came over to my house one time to look at my drawings. He said he thought it would be fun to have a one-man show. This time I was cheating: If I hadn’t been a professor at Caltech, they would have never thought my pictures were worth it.

「Some of my better drawings have been sold, and I feel uncomfortable calling the people,」I said.

「You don’t have to worry, Mr. Feynman,」he reassured me.「You won’t have to call them up. We will make all the arrangements and operate the exhibit officially and correctly.」

I gave him a list of people who had bought my drawings, and they soon received a telephone call from him:「We understand that you have an Ofey.」

「Oh, yes!」

「We are planning to have an exhibition of Ofeys, and we’re wondering if you would consider lending it to us.」Of course they were delighted.

The exhibition was held in the basement of the Athenaeum, the Caltech faculty club. Everything was like the real thing: All the pictures had titles, and those that had been taken on consignment from their owners had due recognition:「Lent by Mr. Gianonni,」for instance.

One drawing was a portrait of the beautiful blonde model from the art class, which I had originally intended to be a study of shading: I put a light at the level of her legs a bit to the side and pointed it upwards. As she sat, I tried to draw the shadows as they were–her nose cast its shadow rather unnaturally across her face–so they wouldn’t look so bad. I drew her torso as well, so you could also see her breasts and the shadows they made. I stuck it in with the other drawings in the exhibit and called it「Madame Curie Observing the Radiations from Radium.」The message I intended to convey was, nobody thinks of Madame Curie as a woman, as feminine, with beautiful hair, bare breasts, and all that. They only think of the radium part.

A prominent industrial designer named Henry Dreyfuss invited various people to a reception at his home after the exhibition–the woman who had contributed money to support the arts, the president of Caltech and his wife, and so on.

One of these art-lovers came over and started up a conversation with me:「Tell me, Professor Feynman, do you draw from photographs or from models?」

「I always draw directly from a posed model.」

「Well, how did you get Madame Curie to pose for you?」

Around that time the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a similar idea to the one I had, that artists are far away from an understanding of science. My idea was that artists don’t understand the underlying generality and beauty of nature and her laws (and therefore cannot portray this in their art). The museum’s idea was that artists should know more about technology: they should become more familiar with machines and other applications of science.

The art museum organized a scheme in which they would get some of the really good artists of the day to go to various companies which volunteered some time and money to the project. The artists would visit these companies and snoop around until they saw something interesting that they could use in their work. The museum thought it might help if someone who knew something about technology could be a sort of liaison with the artists from time to time as they visited the companies. Since they knew I was fairly good at explaining things to people and I wasn’t a complete jackass when it came to art (actually, I think they knew I was trying to learn to draw)–at any rate, they asked me if I would do that, and I agreed.

It was lots of fun visiting the companies with the artists. What typically happened was, some guy would show us a tube that discharged sparks in beautiful blue, twisting patterns. The artists would get all excited and ask me how they could use it in an exhibit. What were the necessary conditions to make it work?

The artists were very interesting people. Some of them were absolute fakes: they would claim to be an artist, and everybody agreed they were an artist, hut when you’d sit and talk to them, they’d make no sense whatsoever! One guy in particular, the biggest faker, always dressed ftmny; he had a big black bowler hat. He would answer your questions in an incomprehensible way, and when you’d try to find out more about what he said by asking him about some of the words he used, off we’d be in another direction! The only thing he contributed, ultimately, to the exhibit for art and technology was a portrait of himself.

Other artists I talked to would say things that made no sense at first, but they would go to great lengths to explain their ideas to me. One time I went somewhere, as a part of this scheme, with Robert Irwin. It was a two-day trip, and after a great effort of discussing back and forth, I finally understood what he was trying to explain to me, and I thought it was quite interesting and wonderful.

Then there were the artists who had absolutely no idea about the real world. They thought that scientists were some kind of grand magicians who could make anything, and would say things like,「I want to make a picture in three dimensions where the figure is suspended in space and it glows and flickers.」They made up the world they wanted, and had no idea what was reasonable or unreasonable to make.

Finally there was an exhibit, and I was asked to be on a panel which judged the works of art. Although there was some good stuff that was inspired by the artists’ visiting the companies, I thought that most of the good works of art were things that were turned in at the last minute out of desperation, and didn’t really have anything to do with technology. All of the other members of the panel disagreed, and I found myself in some difficulty. I’m no good at criticizing art, and I shouldn’t have been on the panel in the first place.

There was a guy there at the county art museum named Maurice Tuchman who really knew what he was talking about when it came to art. He knew that I had had this one-man show at Caltech. He said,「You know, you’re never going to draw again.」

「What? That’s ridiculous! Why should I never.

「Because you’ve had a one-man show, and you’re only an amateur.」

Although I did draw after that, I never worked as hard, with the same energy and intensity, as I did before. I never sold a drawing after that, either. He was a smart fella, and I learned a lot from him. I could have learned a lot more, if I weren’t so stubborn!

——————– Is Electricity Fire? ——————–

In the early fifties I suffered temporarily from a disease of middle age: I used to give philosophical talks about science–how science satisfies curiosity, how it gives you a new world view, how it gives man the ability to do things, how it gives him power–and the question is, in view of the recent development of the atomic bomb, is it a good idea to give man that much power? I also thought about the relation of science and religion, and it was about this time when I was invited to a conference in New York that was going to discuss「the ethics of equality.」

There had already been a conference among the older people, somewhere on Long Island, and this year they decided to have some younger people come in and discuss the position papers they had worked out in the other conference.

Before I got there, they sent around a list of「books you might find interesting to read, and please send us any books you want others to read, and we will store them in the library so that others may read them.」

So here comes this wonderful list of books. I start down the first page: I haven’t read a single one of the books, and I feel very uneasy–I hardly belong. I look at the second page: I haven’t read a single one. I found out, after looking through the whole list, that I haven’t read _any_ of the books. I must be an idiot, an illiterate! There were wonderful books there, like Thomas Jefferson _On Freedom_, or something like that, and there were a few _authors_ I had read. There was a book by Heisenberg, one by Schrodinger, and one by Einstein, but they were something like Einstein, _My Later Years_ and Schrodinger, _What Is Life_–different from what I had read. So I had a feeling that I was out of my depth, and that I shouldn’t be _in_ this. Maybe I could just sit quietly and listen.

I go to the first big introductory meeting, and a guy gets up and explains that we have two problems to discuss. The first one is fogged up a little bit–something about ethics and equality, but I don’t understand what the problem _exactly_ is. And the second one is,「We are going to demonstrate by our efforts a way that we can have a dialogue among people of different fields.」There was an international lawyer, a historian, a Jesuit priest, a rabbi, a scientist (me), and so on.

Well, right away my logical mind goes like this: The second problem I don’t have to pay any attention to, because if it works, it works; and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work– we don’t have to prove that we can have a dialogue, and _discuss_ that we can have a dialogue, if we haven’t got any dialogue to talk about! So the primary problem is the first one, which I didn’t understand.

I was ready to put my hand up and say,「Would you please define the problem better,」but then I thought,「No, _I’m_ the ignoramus; I’d better listen. I don’t want to start trouble right away.」

The subgroup I was in was supposed to discuss the「ethics of equality in education.」In the meetings of our subgroup the Jesuit priest was always talking about「the fragmentation of knowledge.」He would say,「The real problem in the ethics of equality in education is the fragmentation of knowledge.」This Jesuit was looking back into the thirteenth century when the Catholic Church was in charge of all education, and the whole world was simple. There was God, and everything came from God; it was all organized. But today, it’s not so easy to understand everything. So knowledge has become fragmented. I felt that「the fragmentation of knowledge」had nothing to do with「it,」but「it」had never been defined, so there was no way for me to prove that.

Finally I said,「What is the ethical problem associated with the fragmentation of knowledge?」He would only answer me with great clouds of fog, and I’d say,「I don’t understand,」and everybody else would say they _did_ understand, and _they_ tried to explain it to me, but they couldn’t explain it to me!

So the others in the group told me to write down why I thought the fragmentation of knowledge was not a problem of ethics. I went back to my dormitory room and I wrote out carefully, as best I could, what I thought the subject of「the ethics of equality in education」might be, and I gave some examples of the kinds of problems I thought we might be talking about, For instance, in education, you increase differences. If someone’s good at something, you try to develop his ability, which results in differences, or inequalities. So if education increases inequality, is this ethical? Then, after giving some more examples, I went on to say that while「the fragmentation of knowledge」is a difficulty because the complexity of the world makes it hard to learn things, in light of my definition of the _realm_ of the subject, I couldn’t see how the fragmentation of knowledge had anything to do with anything _approximating_ what the ethics of equality in education might more or less be.

The next day I brought my paper into the meeting, and the guy said,「Yes, Mr. Feynman has brought up some very interesting questions we ought to discuss, and we’ll put them aside for some possible future discussion.」They completely missed the point. I was trying to define the problem, and then show how「the fragmentation of knowledge」didn’t have anything to do with it. And the reason that nobody got anywhere in that conference was that they hadn’t clearly defined the subject of「the ethics of equality in education,」and therefore no one knew exactly what they were supposed to talk about.

There was a sociologist who had written a paper for us all to read–something he had written ahead of time. I started to read the damn thing, and my eyes were coming out: I couldn’t make head nor tail of it! I figured it was because I hadn’t read any of the books on that list. I had this uneasy feeling of「I’m not adequate,」until finally I said to myself,「I’m gonna stop, and read _one sentence_ slowly, so I can figure out what the hell it means.」

So I stopped–at random–and read the next sentence very carefully. I can’t remember it precisely, but it was very close to this:「The individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels.」I went back and forth over it, and translated. You know what it means?「People read.」

Then I went over the next sentence, and I realized that I could translate that one also. Then it became a kind of empty business:「Sometimes people read; sometimes people listen to the radio,」and so on, but written in such a fancy way that I couldn’t understand it at first, and when I finally deciphered it, there was nothing to it.

There was only one thing that happened at that meeting that was pleasant or amusing. At this conference, _every word_ that every guy said at the plenary session was so important that they had a stenotypist there, typing every goddamn thing. Somewhere on the second day the stenotypist came up to me and said,「What profession are you? Surely not a professor.」

「I _am_ a professor,」I said.

「Of what?」

「Of physics–science.」

「Oh! _That_ must be the reason,」he said.

「Reason for what?」

He said,「You see, I’m a stenotypist, and I type everything that is said here. Now, when the other fellas talk, I type what they say, but I don’t understand what they’re saying. But every time _you_ get up to ask a question or to say something, I understand exactly what you mean–what the question is, and what you’re saying–so I thought you _can’t_ be a professor!」

There was a special dinner at some point, and the head of the theology place, a very nice, very Jewish man, gave a speech. It was a good speech, and he was a very good speaker, so while it sounds crazy now, when I’m telling about it, at that time his main idea sounded completely obvious and true. He talked about the big differences in the welfare of various countries, which cause jealousy, which leads to conflict, and now that we have atomic weapons, any war and we’re doomed, so therefore the right way out is to strive for peace by making sure there are no great differences from place to place, and since we have so much in the United States, we should give up nearly everything to the other countries until we’re all even. Everybody was listening to this, and we were all full of sacrificial feeling, and all thinking we ought to do this. But I came back to my senses on the way home.

The next day one of the guys in our group said,「I think that speech last night was so good that we should all endorse it, and it should be the summary of our conference.」

I started to say that the idea of distributing everything evenly is based on a _theory_ that there’s only X amount of stuff in the world, that somehow we took it away from the poorer countries in the first place, and therefore we should give it back to them. But this theory doesn’t take into account the _real_ reason for the differences between countries–that is, the development of new techniques for growing food, the development of machinery to grow food and to do other things, and the fact that all this machinery requires the concentration of capital. It isn’t the _stuff_, but the power to _make_ the stuff, that is important. But I realize now that these people were not in science; they didn’t understand it. They didn’t understand technology; they didn’t understand their time.

The conference made me so nervous that a girl I knew in New York had to calm me down.「Look,」she said,「you’re shaking! You’ve gone absolutely nuts! Just take it easy, and don’t take it so seriously. Back away a minute and look at what it is.」So I thought about the conference, how crazy it was, and it wasn’t so bad. But if someone were to ask me to participate in something like that again, I’d shy away from it like mad–I mean zero! No! Absolutely not! And I still get invitations for this kind of thing today.

When it came time to evaluate the conference at the end, the others told how much they got out of it, how successful it was, and so on. When they asked me, I said,「This conference was worse than a Rorschach test: There’s a meaningless inkblot, and the others ask you what you think you see, but when you tell them, they start arguing with you!

Even worse, at the end of the conference they were going to have another meeting, but this time the public would come, and the guy in charge of our group has the _nerve_ to say that since we’ve worked out so much, there won’t be any time for public discussion, so we’ll just _tell_ the public all the things we’ve worked out. My eyes bugged out: I didn’t think we had worked out a damn thing!

Finally, when we were discussing the question of whether we had developed a way of having a dialogue among people of different disciplines–our second basic「problem」–I said that I noticed something interesting. Each of us talked about what we thought the「ethics of equality」was, from our own point of view, without paying any attention to the other guy’s point of view. For example, the historian proposed that the way to understand ethical problems is to look historically at how they evolved and how they developed; the international lawyer suggested that the way to do it is to see how in fact people actually act in different situations and make their arrangements; the Jesuit priest was always referring to「the fragmentation of knowledge」; and I, as a scientist, proposed that we should isolate the problem in a way analogous to Galileo’s techniques for experiments; and so on.「So, in my opinion,」I said,「we had no dialogue at all. Instead, we had nothing but chaos!」

Of course I was attacked, from all around.「Don’t you think that order can come from chaos?」

「Uh, well, as a general principle, or . . . I didn’t understand what to do with a question like「Can order come from chaos?」Yes, no, what of it?

There were a lot of fools at that conference–pompous fools–and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools–guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus–THAT, I CANNOT STAND! An ordinary fool isn’t a faker; an honest fool is all right. But a dishonest fool is terrible! And that’s what I got at the conference, a bunch of pompous fools, and I got very upset. I’m not going to get upset like that again, so I won’t participate in interdisciplinary conferences any more.

A footnote: While I was at the conference, I stayed at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where young rabbis–I think they were Orthodox–were studying. Since I have a Jewish background, I knew of some of the things they told me about the Talmud, but I had never seen the Talmud. It was very interesting. It’s got big pages, and in a little square in the corner of the page is the original Talmud, and then in a sort of L-shaped margin, all around this square, are commentaries written by different people. The Talmud has evolved, and everything has been discussed again and again, all very carefully, in a medieval kind of reasoning. I think the commentaries were shut down around the thirteen- or fourteen- or fifteen-hundreds–there hasn’t been any modern commentary. The Talmud is a wonderful book, a great, big potpourri of things: trivial questions, and difficult questions–for example, problems of teachers, and how to teach–and then some trivia again, and so on. The students told me that the Talmud was never translated, something I thought was curious, since the book is so valuable,

One day, two or three of the young rabbis came to me and said,「We realize that we can’t study to be rabbis in the modern world without knowing something about science, so we’d like to ask you some questions.」

Of course there are thousands of places to find out about science, and Columbia University was right near there, but I wanted to know what kinds of questions they were interested in.

They said,「Well, for instance, is electricity fire?」

「No,」I said,「but. . . what is the problem?」

They said,「In the Talmud it says you’re not supposed to make fire on a Saturday, so our question is, can we use electrical things on Saturdays?」

I was shocked. They weren’t interested in science at all! The only way science was influencing their lives was so they might be able to interpret better the Talmud! They weren’t interested in the world outside, in natural phenomena; they were only interested in resolving some question brought up in the Talmud.

And then one day–I guess it was a Saturday–I want to go up in the elevator, and there’s a guy standing near the elevator. The elevator comes, I go in, and he goes in with me. I say,「Which floor?」and my hand’s ready to push one of the buttons.

「No, no!」he says,「_I’m_ supposed to push the buttons for _you_.」

「_What?_」

「Yes! The boys here can’t push the buttons on Saturday, so I have to do it for them. You see, I’m not Jewish, so it’s all right for _me_ to push the buttons. I stand near the elevator, and they tell me what floor, and I push the button for them.」

Well, this really bothered me, so I decided to trap the students in a logical discussion. I had been brought up in a Jewish home, so I knew the kind of nitpicking logic to use, and I thought,「Here’s fun!」

My plan went like this: I’d start off by asking,「Is the Jewish viewpoint a viewpoint that _any_ man can have? Because if it is not, then it’s certainly not something that is truly valuable for humanity . . . yak, yak, yak.」And then they would have to say,「Yes, the Jewish viewpoint is good for any man.」

Then I would steer them around a little more by asking,「Is it ethical for a man to hire another man to do something which is unethical for him to do? Would you hire a man to rob for you, for instance?」And I keep working them into the channel, very slowly, and very carefully until I’ve got them–trapped!

And do you know what happened? They’re rabbinical students, right? They were ten times better than I was! As soon as they saw I could put them in a hole, they went twist, turn, twist–I can’t remember how–and they were free! I thought I had come up with an original idea–phooey! It had been discussed in the Talmud for ages! So they cleaned me up just as easy as pie–they got right out.

Finally I tried to assure the rabbinical students that the electric spark that was bothering them when they pushed the elevator buttons was not fire. I said,「Electricity is _not_ fire. It’s not a chemical process, as fire is.」

「Oh?」they said.

「Of course, there’s electricity in amongst the _atoms_ in a fire.」

「Aha!」they said.

「And in every _other_ phenomenon that occurs in the world.」

I even proposed a practical solution for eliminating the spark.「If that’s what’s bothering you, you can put a condenser across the switch, so the electricity will go on and off without any spark whatsoever–anywhere.」But for some reason, they didn’t like that idea either.

It really was a disappointment. Here they are, slowly coming to life, only to better interpret the Talmud. Imagine! In modern times like this, guys are studying to go into society and do something–to be a rabbi–and the only way they think that science might be interesting is because their ancient, provincial, medieval problems are being confounded slightly by some new phenomena.

Something else happened at that time which is worth mentioning here. One of the questions the rabbinical students and I discussed at some length was why it is that in academic things, such as theoretical physics, there is a higher proportion of Jewish kids than their proportion in the general population. The rabbinical students thought the reason was that the Jews have a history of respecting learning: They respect their rabbis, who are really teachers, and they respect education. The Jews pass on this tradition in their families all the time, so that if a boy is a good student, it’s as good as, if not better than, being a good football player.

It was the same afternoon that I was reminded how true it is. I was invited to one of the rabbinical students’ home, and he introduced me to his mother, who had just come back from Washington, D.C. She clapped her hands together, in ecstasy, and said,「Oh! My day is complete. Today I met a general, and a professor!」

I realized that there are not many people who think it’s just as important, and just as nice, to meet a professor as to meet a general. So I guess there’s something in what they said.

——————- Judging Books

by Their Covers ——————-

After the war, physicists were often asked to go to Washington and give advice to various sections of the government, especially the military. What happened, I suppose, is that since the scientists had made these bombs that were so important, the military felt we were useful for something.

Once I was asked to serve on a committee which was to evaluate various weapons for the army, and I wrote a letter back which explained that I was only a theoretical physicist, and I didn’t know anything about weapons for the army.

The army responded that they had found in their experience that theoretical physicists were very useful to them in making decisions, so would I please reconsider?

I wrote back again and said I didn’t really know anything, and doubted I could help them.

Finally I got a letter from the Secretary of the Army, which proposed a compromise: I would come to the first meeting, where I could listen and see whether I could make a contribution or not. Then I could decide whether I should continue.

I said I would, of course. What else could I do?

I went down to Washington and the first thing that I went to was a cocktail party to meet everybody. There were generals and other important characters from the army, and everybody talked. It was pleasant enough.

One guy in a uniform came to me and told me that the army was glad that physicists were advising the military because it had a lot of problems. One of the problems was that tanks use up their fuel very quickly and thus can’t go very far. So the question was how to refuel them as they’re going along. Now this guy had the idea that, since the physicists can get energy out of uranium, could I work out a way in which we could use silicon dioxide–sand, dirt–as a fuel? If that were possible, then all this tank would have to do would be to have a little scoop underneath, and as it goes along, it would pick up the dirt and use it for fuel! He thought that was a great idea, and that all I had to do was to work out the details. That was the kind of problem I thought we would be talking about in the meeting the next day.

I went to the meeting and noticed that some guy who had introduced me to all the people at the cocktail party was sitting next to me. He was apparently some flunky assigned to be at my side at all times. On my other side was some super general I had heard of before.

At the first session of the meeting they talked about some technical matters, and I made a few comments. But later on, near the end of the meeting, they began to discuss some problem of logistics, about which I knew nothing. It had to do with figuring out how much stuff you should have at different places at different times. And although I tried to keep my trap shut, when you get into a situation like that, where you’re sitting around a table with all these「important people」discussing these「important problems,」you _can’t_ keep your mouth shut, even if you know nothing whatsoever! So I made some comments in that discussion, too.

During the next coffee break the guy who had been assigned to shepherd me around said,「I was very impressed by the things you said during the discussion. They certainly were an important contribution.」

I stopped and thought about my「contribution」to the logistics problem, and realized that a man like the guy who orders the stuff for Christmas at Macy’s would be better able to figure out how to handle problems like that than I. So I concluded: a) if I had made an important contribution, it was sheer luck; b) anybody else could have done as well, but _most_ people could have done _better_, and c) this flattery should wake me up to the fact that I am _not_ capable of contributing much.

Right after that they decided, in the meeting, that they could do better discussing the _organization_ of scientific research (such as, should scientific development be under the Corps of Engineers or the Quartermaster Division?) than specific technical matters. I knew that if there was to be _any_ hope of my making a real contribution, it would be only on some specific technical matter, and surely not on how to organize research in the army.

Until then I didn’t let on any of my feelings about the situation to the chairman of the meeting–the big shot who had invited me in the first place. As we were packing our bags to leave, he said to me, all smiles,「You’ll be joining us, then, for the next meeting..

「No, I won’t.」I could see his face change suddenly. He was _very_ surprised that I would say no, after making those「contributions.」

In the early sixties, a lot of my friends were still giving advice to the government. Meanwhile, I was having no feeling of social responsibility and resisting, as much as possible, offers to go to Washington, which took a certain amount of courage in those times.

I was giving a series of freshman physics lectures at that time, and after one of them, Tom Harvey, who assisted me in putting on the demonstrations, said,「You oughta see what’s happening to mathematics in schoolbooks! My daughter comes home with a lot of crazy stuff!」

I didn’t pay much attention to what he said.

But the next day I got a telephone call from a pretty famous lawyer here in Pasadena, Mr. Norris, who was at that time on the State Board of Education. He asked me if I would serve on the State Curriculum Commission, which had to choose the new schoolbooks for the state of California. You see, the state had a law that all of the schoolbooks used by all of the kids in all of the public schools have to be chosen by the State Board of Education, so they have a committee to look over the books and to give them advice on which books to take.

It happened that a lot of the books were on a new method of teaching arithmetic that they called「new math,」and since usually the only people to look at the books were schoolteachers or administrators in education, they thought it would be a good idea to have somebody who _uses_ mathematics scientifically, who knows what the end product is and what we’re trying to teach it for, to help in the evaluation of the schoolbooks.

I must have had, by this time, a guilty feeling about not cooperating with the government, because I agreed to get on this committee.

_Immediately_ I began getting letters and telephone calls from book publishers. They said things like,「We’re very glad to hear you’re on the committee because we really wanted a scientific guy . . . and「It’s wonderful to have a scientist on the committee, because our books are scientifically oriented . . .」

But they also said things like,「We’d like to explain to you what our book is about . . .」and「We’ll be very glad to help you in any way we can to judge our books . . .」

That seemed to me kind of crazy. I’m an objective scientist, and it seemed to me that since the only thing the kids in school are going to get is the books (and the teachers get the teacher’s manual, which I would also get), any _extra_ explanation from the company was a distortion. So I didn’t want to speak to any of the publishers and always replied,「You don’t have to explain; I’m sure the books will speak for themselves.」

I represented a certain district, which comprised most of the Los Angeles area except for the city of Los Angeles, which was represented by a very nice lady from the L.A. school system named Mrs. Whitehouse. Mr. Norris suggested that I meet her and find out what the committee did and how it worked.

Mrs. Whitehouse started out telling me about the stuff they were going to talk about in the next meeting (they had already had one meeting; I was appointed late).「They’re going to talk about the counting numbers.」I didn’t know what that was, but it turned out they were what I used to call integers. They had different names for everything, so I had a lot of trouble right from the start.

She told me how the members of the commission normally rated the new schoolbooks. They would get a relatively large number of copies of each book and would give them to various teachers and administrators in their district. Then they would get reports back on what these people thought about the books. Since I didn’t know a lot of teachers or administrators, and since I felt that I could, by reading the books myself, make up my mind as to how they looked to _me_, I chose to read all the books myself. (There were some people in my district who had expected to look at the books and wanted a chance to give their opinion. Mrs. Whitehouse offered to put their reports in with hers so they would feel better and I wouldn’t have to worry about their complaints. They were satisfied, and I didn’t get much trouble.)

A few days later a guy from the book depository called me up and said,「We’re ready to send you the books, Mr. Feynman; there are three hundred pounds.」

I was overwhelmed.

「It’s all right, Mr. Feynman; we’ll get someone to help you read them.」

I couldn’t figure out how you _do_ that: you either read them or you don’t read them. I had a special bookshelf put in my study downstairs (the books took up seventeen feet), and began reading all the books that were going to be discussed in the next meeting. We were going to start out with the elementary schoolbooks.

It was a pretty big job, and I worked all the time at it down in the basement. My wife says that during this period it was like living over a volcano. It would be quiet for a while, but then all of a sudden,「BLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!」–there would be a big explosion from the「volcano」below. The reason was that the books were so lousy. They were false. They were hurried. They would _try_ to be rigorous, but they would use examples (like automobiles in the street for「sets」) which were _almost_ OK, but in which there were always some subtleties. The definitions weren’t accurate. Everything was a little bit ambiguous–they weren’t _smart_ enough to understand what was meant by「rigor.」They were faking it. They were teaching something they didn’t understand, and which was, in fact, _useless_, at that time, for the child.

I understood what they were trying to do. Many people thought we were behind the Russians after Sputnik, and some mathematicians were asked to give advice on how to teach math by using some of the rather interesting modern concepts of mathematics. The purpose was to enhance mathematics for the children who found it dull.

I’ll give you an example: They would talk about different bases of numbers–five, six, and so on–to show the possibilities. That would be interesting for a kid who could understand base ten–something to entertain his mind. But what they had turned it into, in these books, was that _every_ child had to learn another base! And then the usual horror would come:「Translate these numbers, which are written in base seven, to base five.」Translating from one base to another is an _utterly useless_ thing. If you _can_ do it, maybe it’s entertaining; if you _can’t_ do it, forget it. There’s no _point_ to it.

Anyhow, I’m looking at all these books, all these books, and none of them has said anything about using arithmetic in science. If there are any examples on the use of arithmetic at all (most of the time it’s this abstract new modern nonsense), they are about things like buying stamps.

Finally I come to a book that says,「Mathematics is used in science in many ways. We will give you an example from astronomy, which is the science of stars.」I turn the page, and it says,「Red stars have a temperature of four thousand degrees, yellow stars have a temperature of five thousand degrees . . .」–so far, so good. It continues:「Green stars have a temperature of seven thousand degrees, blue stars have a temperature of ten thousand degrees, and violet stars have a temperature of . . . (some big number).」There are no green or violet stars, but the figures for the others are roughly correct. It’s _vaguely_ right–but already, trouble! That’s the way everything was: Everything was written by somebody who didn’t know what the hell he was talking about, so it was a little bit wrong, always! And how we are going to teach well by using books written by people who don’t _quite_ understand what they’re talking about, I _cannot_ understand. I don’t know why, but the books are lousy; UNIVERSALLY LOUSY!

Anyway, I’m _happy_ with this book, because it’s the first example of applying arithmetic to science. I’m a _bit_ unhappy when I read about the stars’ temperatures, but I’m not _very_ unhappy because it’s more or less right–it’s just an example of error. Then cdtnes the list of problems. It says,「John and his father go out to look at the stars. John sees two blue stars and a red star. His father sees a green star, a violet star, and two yellow stars. What is the total temperature of the stars seen by John and his father?」–and I would explode in horror.

My wife would talk about the volcano downstairs. That’s only an example: it was _perpetually_ like that. Perpetual absurdity! There’s no purpose whatsoever in adding the temperature of two stars. Nobody ever does that except, maybe, to then take the _average_ temperature of the stars, but _not_ to find out the _total_ temperature of all the stars! It was awful! All it was was a game to get you to add, and they didn’t understand what they were talking about. It was like reading sentences with a few typographical errors, and then suddenly a whole sentence is written backwards. The mathematics was like that. Just hopeless!

Then I came to my first meeting. The other members had given some kind of ratings to some of the books, and they asked me what _my_ ratings were. My rating was often different from theirs, and they would ask,「Why did you rate that book low?」

I would say the trouble with that book was this and this on page so-and-so–I had my notes.

They discovered that I was kind of a goldmine: I would tell them, in detail, what was good and bad in all the books; I had a reason for every rating.

I would ask them why they had rated this book so high, and they would say,「Let us hear what you thought about such and such a book.」I would never find out why they rated anything the way they did. Instead, they kept asking me what _I_ thought.

We came to a certain book, part of a set of three supplementary books published by the same company, and they asked me what I thought about it.

I said,「The book depository didn’t send me that book, but the other two were nice.」

Someone tried repeating the question:「What do you think about that book?」

「I said they didn’t send me that one, so I don’t have any judgment on it.」

The man from the book depository was there, and he said,「Excuse me; I can explain that. I didn’t send it to you because that book hadn’t been completed yet. There’s a rule that you have to have every entry in by a certain time, and the publisher was a few days late with it. So it was sent to us with just the covers, and it’s blank in between. The company sent a note excusing themselves and hoping they could have their set of three books considered, even though the third one would be late.」

It turned out that the blank book had a rating by some of the other members! They couldn’t believe it was blank, because they had a rating. In fact, the rating for the missing book was a little bit higher than for the two others. The fact that there was nothing in the book had nothing to do with the rating.

I believe the reason for all this is that the system works this way: When you give books all over the place to people, they’re busy; they’re careless; they think,「Well, a lot of people are reading this book, SO it doesn’t make any difference.」And they put in some kind of number–some of them, at least; not all of them, but _some_ of them. Then when you receive your reports, you don’t know _why_ this particular book has fewer reports than the other books–that is, perhaps one book has ten, and this one only has six people reporting–so you average the rating of those who reported; you don’t average the ones who didn’t report, so you get a reasonable number. This process of averaging all the time misses the fact that there is absolutely nothing between the covers of the book!

I made that theory up because I saw what happened in the curriculum commission: For the blank book, only six out of the ten members were reporting, whereas with the other books, eight or nine out of the ten were reporting. And when they averaged the six, they got as good an average as when they averaged with eight or nine. They were very embarrassed to discover they were giving ratings to that book, and it gave me a little bit more confidence. It turned out the other members of the committee had done a lot of work in giving out the books and collecting reports, and had gone to sessions in which the book publishers would _explain_ the books before they read them; I was the only guy on that commission who read all the books and didn’t get any information from the book publishers except what was in the books themselves, the things that would ultimately go to the schools.

This question of trying to figure out whether a book is good or bad by looking at it carefully or by taking the reports of a lot of people who looked at it carelessly is like this famous old problem: Nobody was permitted to see the Emperor of China, and the question was, What is the length of the Emperor of China’s nose? To find out, you go all over the country asking people what they think the length of the Emperor of China’s nose is, and you _average_ it. And that would be very「accurate」because you averaged so many people. But it’s no way to find anything out; when you have a very wide range of people who contribute without looking carefully at it, you don’t improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.
