# Chapter 2 Your Title Makes You a Manager. Your People Make You a Leader.

In July 2001, Google was on the verge of its third birthday and had recently launched the AdWords advertising product, which would soon propel it into the stratosphere. The company had several hundred employees, including many software engineers working under Wayne Rosing, a former Apple and Sun executive who had joined the company six months earlier. Wayne wasn’t happy with the performance of his current set of managers. They were strong engineers, but not great managers. So he discussed his concerns with Larry and Sergey, and they came up with a somewhat radical idea that they brought to Eric. They would get rid of all the managers in the engineering organization. Wayne and Eric decided to call it a「disorg」: all those software engineers, reporting directly to Wayne.

Larry and Sergey loved the idea. Neither of them had ever worked in a formal business before, and both liked the less structured environment of a university, where students come together for projects, often under the auspices of an advisor, and none are「managed.」Coming from the academic world, they had always been skeptical of the role of a manager. Why do you need a manager? Why not just let these supertalented engineers work on projects, and when the project is done, or their work on the project is done, they can go pick another project? If company execs needed to know how a particular project was going, why talk to a manager who may not be actually doing the work? Why not just go talk to the engineer? Never mind that the first manager was probably created within minutes of the first company.* This was Google, where convention went to die.

And so started Google’s experiment of running a fast-moving product development team without managers. This was right around the time that Bill started working with the company. Larry and Sergey were just getting used to working alongside Eric, and now they had yet another newcomer hanging around. Bill took his time, getting to know Eric, Larry, Sergey, and other members of the executive team mostly by dropping by in the evenings, when things were more relaxed. He spent the time talking to people about what they were doing and their vision for the company, getting to know the company and the culture.

During one of these conversations Bill mentioned to Larry that「we have to get some managers in here.」Larry was nonplussed. After all, he had just gotten rid of all the managers, and he was quite happy with that. Why does a company of several hundred employees, shipping a product that would eventually generate billions in revenue, need managers? Weren’t we doing better without them? This went on for a while, the argument going back and forth, both men firm in their convictions. Finally Bill took a page from Larry’s book and suggested that they just go talk to the engineers. He, Larry, and Sergey wandered down the hall until they found a couple of software engineers working. Bill asked one of them if he wanted a manager.

Yes, came the response.

Why?

「I want someone I can learn from, and someone to break ties.」

They chatted with several software engineers that night, and most of the responses were similar. These engineers liked being managed, as long as their manager was someone from whom they could learn something, and someone who helped make decisions. Bill was right! Although it took a while to convince the founders of this: Google engineering continued in「disorg」mode for more than a year. We finally called it quits and brought back people managers near the end of 2002.

In fact, academic research finds merit in both approaches. A 1991 study finds that when a company is in the implementation stage of an innovation (such as when Google was developing its search engine and AdWords), they need managers to help coordinate resources and resolve conflicts. However, a 2005 study finds that creativity flourishes in environments, such as Broadway shows, that are more network-oriented than hierarchical. So there’s always tension between creativity and operational efficiency.1

To Bill, being an executive of a successful company is all about management, about creating operational excellence. As a manager and CEO, Bill was very good at making sure his teams delivered. He brought people together and created a strong team culture, but never lost sight of the fact that results mattered, and that they were a direct result of good management.「You have to think about how you’re going to run a meeting,」he told a group of Googlers in a management seminar.「How you’re going to run an operations review. You’ve got to be able to look at someone in a one-on-one and know how to help them course correct. People who are successful run their companies well. They have good processes, they make sure their people are accountable, they know how to hire great people, how to evaluate them and give them feedback, and they pay them well.」

Silicon Valley people can get off track, chasing other goals beyond running a good operation. Bill was very good at making sure that it’s a results-oriented game. We’re going to come together to have a team culture, but it’s to achieve results.

Research backs Bill up on this point. A comprehensive 2017 study on manufacturing plants across the United States found that the ones that adopted performance-oriented management techniques, such as monitoring, targeting, and incentives, performed much better than other plants.2 Good management practices were as important as R&D and IT investments and worker skill level. Good management matters in creative endeavors as well. A 2012 study showed that in the video game industry, strong middle management accounted for 22 percent of the variance in revenue, while game creative design accounted for only 7 percent.3

Bill felt that leadership was something that evolved as a result of management excellence.「How do you bring people around and help them flourish in your environment? It’s not by being a dictator. It’s not by telling them what the hell to do. It’s making sure that they feel valued by being in the room with you. Listen. Pay attention. This is what great managers do.」

Harvard Business School professor Linda Hill, who studies management and first-time managers in particular, agrees that being a dictator doesn’t work. She wrote in 2007,「New managers soon learn . . . that when direct reports are told to do something, they don’t necessarily respond. In fact, the more talented the subordinate, the less likely she is to simply follow orders.」A manager’s authority, she concludes,「emerges only as the manager establishes credibility with subordinates, peers, and superiors.」4 (Another study concludes that people don’t just chafe against an authoritarian management style, but are also more likely to leave the team altogether!)5

Or, as Bill liked to say:「If you’re a great manager, your people will make you a leader. They acclaim that, not you.」He attributed this mantra to Donna Dubinsky and usually included the not-so-flattering story behind it. Donna worked with Bill at Apple and Claris, the software company that was spun out of Apple. Bill had been a big shot at Apple, VP of sales and marketing, and had been very successful at Kodak. In both companies he had been detail oriented, frequently micromanaging his team members. That worked pretty well, so when he took on the CEO role at Claris, he figured it was his job to tell everyone what to do. Which he did. Late one afternoon Donna dropped by Bill’s office and told him that if he was going to tell everyone what to do, they were all going to quit and go back to Apple. No one wanted to work for a dictator. She added a bit more wisdom for the first-time CEO:「Bill, your title makes you a manager; your people make you a leader.」*

Bill took that to heart. He once sent a note to a valuable manager who was struggling, counseling him that「you have demanded respect, rather than having it accrue to you. You need to project humility, a selflessness, that projects that you care about the company and about people.」

He was concerned that people he worked with would mistake charisma for leadership, which was somewhat surprising coming from a man who worked closely with Steve Jobs—the poster child for a charismatic business leader—for nearly three decades. But Bill believed that Jobs wasn’t a great leader during his first stint at Apple, which ended when John Sculley and the board removed him from the company in 1985. When Jobs returned to Apple as CEO in 1997, after Apple had purchased his company NeXT, Bill saw that Steve had changed.「He had always been charismatic, passionate, and brilliant. But when he returned, I watched him become a great manager. He was detailed in everything. Product of course, but also in the way he ran the finance organization, the sales organization, what he did with operations and logistics. I learned from that. Steve couldn’t be a good leader until he became a good manager.」

So when we met Bill in our weekly coaching sessions, what we discussed first and foremost was management: operations and tactics. Bill rarely weighed in on strategic issues, and if he did, it was usually to make sure that there was a strong operating plan to accompany the strategy. What were the current crises? How quickly were we going to manage our way out of them? How was hiring going? How were we developing our teams? How were our staff meetings going? Were we getting input from everyone? What was being said, what wasn’t being said? He cared that the company was well run, and that we were improving as managers.

IT’S THE PEOPLE

In August 2008, the website Gawker published an article titled「The 10 Most Terrible Tyrants of Tech.」6「Here’s to the screaming ones,」the article started, in a parody of the 1997 Richard Dreyfuss–narrated「Think Different」Apple TV ad.「The chair-throwers. The death-threat makers. The imperious gazers. The ones who see things differently—and will stare you down until you do, too. They’re not fond of rules, especially those outlined by the human resources department on ‘treating your employees with respect.’」

The article went on to list the most notorious of the tech industry’s villains: Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer, Bill Gates, Marc Benioff, and there, second to last, the only Google representative on the list, our own Jonathan Rosenberg. Jonathan was ebullient. He was on a top-ten list featuring the biggest stars of the industry, a hard-ass hall of fame if there ever was one! A few days later, when he walked into his 1:1 with Bill, a printed copy of the article lay on the conference table. Jonathan grinned.

Bill did not.「Jonathan, this is not something to be proud of!」Jonathan mumbled some form of response, which Bill cut off with a stream of expletives, concluding with a dagger to Jonathan’s weak defense.「What if I were to send this to your mother? What would she think?」They both agreed that Rina Rosenberg would not be happy to see her son on that list.

This is when Bill first shared with Jonathan his「it’s the people」manifesto. Bill had developed this while he was at Intuit and often repeated it practically verbatim to the two of us and other coachees.

IT’S THE PEOPLE

People are the foundation of any company’s success. The primary job of each manager is to help people be more effective in their job and to grow and develop. We have great people who want to do well, are capable of doing great things, and come to work fired up to do them. Great people flourish in an environment that liberates and amplifies that energy. Managers create this environment through support, respect, and trust.

Support means giving people the tools, information, training, and coaching they need to succeed. It means continuous effort to develop people’s skills. Great managers help people excel and grow.

Respect means understanding people’s unique career goals and being sensitive to their life choices. It means helping people achieve these career goals in a way that’s consistent with the needs of the company.

Trust means freeing people to do their jobs and to make decisions. It means knowing people want to do well and believing that they will.

* * *

Numerous academic studies, and constant executive platitudes, show that a company’s people should be treated as an asset. But executives often overlook a company’s management culture when they are looking for ways to improve performance. This is a mistake: a 1999 article notes that firms that improve their management practices by one standard deviation above the mean can raise their market value by dollar18,000 per employee.7 And a Google internal study in 2008 (one that Bill loved) proved that teams with managers who regularly practiced a set of eight behaviors had lower turnover and higher satisfaction and performance. Topping the list of behaviors:「is a good coach.」*

It’s the people applies in other arenas as well. For example, Peter Pilling, the athletic director at Columbia, worked with Bill to shift the mission and values of his department. In Peter’s case,「it’s the people」became「it’s the student athletes.」Now, when Peter and his team think about a decision, their first consideration is the student athletes. How will that decision affect them, is it consistent with the department’s mission to「maximize the opportunities for our student athletes to reach their highest levels of achievement」? Do the student athletes know how much the administrators and coaches care about them? They take a holistic approach to their student athletes, trying to support them in all aspects of their lives, not just the athletic portion. Peter holds quarterly meetings with all of his head coaches, so they can have an open discussion—full candor expected—about their athletes. All of this is a direct result of Bill’s principles.

When Brad Smith took over as CEO of Intuit, Bill told him that he would go to bed every night thinking about those eight thousand souls who work for him. What are they thinking and feeling? How can I make them the best they can be? Ronnie Lott says, when talking about two coaches he worked closely with, Bill Walsh and Bill Campbell:「Great coaches lie awake at night thinking about how to make you better. They relish creating an environment where you get more out of yourself. Coaches are like great artists getting the stroke exactly right on a painting. They are painting relationships. Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about how they are going to make someone else better. But that’s what coaches do. It’s what Bill Campbell did, he just did it on a different field.」*

「What keeps you up at night?」is a traditional question asked of executives. For Bill the answer was always the same: the well-being and success of his people.

START WITH TRIP REPORTS

For more than a decade, Eric held his weekly staff meetings on Mondays at 1 p.m. In many ways, these meetings were pretty much like any other staff meeting you might have been to. There was an agenda, check-ins with everyone around the table, people surreptitiously checking email and texts . . . all the usual stuff. Eric did one thing different from the norm, though: when everyone had come into the room and gotten settled, he’d start by asking what people did for the weekend, or, if they had just come back from a trip, he’d ask for an informal trip report. This was a staff that included Larry Page and Sergey Brin, so often the weekend report included kiteboarding tales or updates from the world of extreme fitness, but it also could skew toward the more mundane: Jonathan’s daughter’s latest soccer achievements, or engineering lead Alan Eustace’s score on the golf course.* Sometimes, if he had just returned from a business trip, Eric offered his own report, putting a Google map on the screen with pins dropped on the cities where he’d visited. He’d go city by city, talking about his trip and the interesting things he’d observed.

While this conversation seemed impromptu and informal at first glance, it was a part of a communications approach that Bill had developed over the years and improved in collaboration with Eric. The objectives were twofold. First, for team members to get to know each other as people, with families and interesting lives outside of work. And second, to get everyone involved in the meeting from the outset in a fun way, as Googlers and human beings, and not just as experts and owners of their particular roles. Bill and Eric understood that there’s a direct correlation between fun work environments and higher performance, with conversation about family and fun (what academics might call「socioemotional communication」) being an easy way to achieve the former.

Later in the meeting, when business decisions were being discussed, Eric wanted everyone to weigh in, regardless of whether the issue touched on their functional area or not. The simple communications practice—getting people to share stories, to be personal with each other—was in fact a tactic to ensure better decision making and camaraderie.

「At first I thought it was really weird,」Dick Costolo says of the trip report practice, which he also learned from Bill.「But when I started doing it and seeing it in practice, wow, it really makes a difference. The whole dynamic of the meeting changes, you get more empathy, a better mood.」Dick tells the story of how he attended the staff meeting of a CEO he was mentoring, and the meeting started with hot topics and issues—no social talk whatsoever.「It really hit me in the face how jarring that was. I couldn’t tell how well the team worked together and connected.」

Marissa Mayer developed a variation of the trip report practice when she was CEO of Yahoo. Rather than trip reports, her staff meetings started with thank-yous.「My staff called it the family prayer. You have to thank another team for something that happened last week. You can’t thank yourself, and you can’t repeat what someone else said. This ends up being a nice way to recap the entire week.」

Bill believed that communications were critical to a company’s success. He frequently coached us to make sure that others in the company understood what we understood. Even when you have clearly communicated something, it may take a few times to sink in. Repetition doesn’t spoil the prayer. In fact, a 2002 study from Southern Methodist University shows that knowing what to share and communicate and with whom is an important part of a manager’s job. Done right, this「knowledge commonality」helps the team perform better and is well worth the time it requires.8

Bill had us pay close attention to running meetings well;「get the 1:1 right」and「get the staff meeting right」are tops on the list of his most important management principles. He felt that these meetings are the most important tools available to executives in running the company, and that each one should be approached thoughtfully.

Staff meetings should be a forum for the most important issues and opportunities, more so than 1:1s.「Use meetings to get everyone on the same page, get to the right debate, and make decisions.」Most important issues cut across functions, but, more important, bringing them to the table in team meetings lets people understand what is going on in the other teams, and discussing them as a group helps develop understanding and build cross-functional strength. This applies even to some issues that perhaps might be solved in 1:1s, because they give the team practice in tackling challenges together. GO founder Jerry Kaplan recalls, in his book Startup, a time when he wanted to discuss GO’s growing competition with Microsoft in his 1:1 with Bill. This was a critical topic, requiring detailed discussion of confidential and potentially controversial issues, so a one-on-one between the founder and the CEO seemed like the best forum for it. But Bill said no. He wanted to discuss and decide the issue as a team.9

Research confirms that team meetings are a terrific opportunity to engage people, with one 2013 study concluding that the relevance of the meeting, giving everyone a voice, and managing the clock well are key factors to achieving that engagement.10 This doesn’t always happen; another study, from 2015, notes that more than 50 percent of study participants do not think that their meetings are an effective use of their time. This study covered all meetings, not just staff meetings, but still, it demonstrates that being thoughtful about preparing for staff meetings is an important management practice.11

FIVE WORDS ON A WHITEBOARD

Our one-on-one meetings with Bill were always held at his nondescript office off California Avenue, Palo Alto’s quieter commercial district a mile or so south of the glitzier University Avenue. This felt like a waste of time at first—why couldn’t he come to Google?—but we quickly realized it was the right location. After all, when you go see your therapist, you go see your therapist. When making the pilgrimage to Bill, you’d enter through an unmarked door, go up the stairs to the second floor, down a hallway, give Debbie Brookfield, his longtime assistant, a hug, then go into the conference room to wait for him. For Eric’s meetings, there were always five words written on the whiteboard, indicating the topics to discuss that day. The words might be about a person, a product, an operational issue, or an upcoming meeting. That’s how they organized their talk.

When we were working on this book and Eric talked about his meetings with Bill, Jonathan had to intervene. That was not how Bill started 1:1s, Jonathan reminded Eric. While Bill did have his top-five list of things to discuss, he didn’t write them on the whiteboard for all to see. Rather, he would hold them back, like a poker player holding his cards close to the vest. After talking about family and other nonwork stuff, Bill would ask Jonathan what his top five items were. Jonathan came to realize that this approach was Bill’s way of seeing how Jonathan was prioritizing his time and effort. If Bill led off with his list, Jonathan simply could have agreed with it. The discussion of the list was in itself a form of coaching (apparently one that Eric never needed).

In teaching his management seminar at Google, Bill advocated that each person should put his or her list on the board—a simultaneous reveal. That way everyone could see where there was overlap and make sure to cover those topics. He felt that the process of merging the two agendas could serve as a lesson in prioritization.

Regardless of whose five topics go on the whiteboard first, what’s important is that each side has a set of topics to cover and is ready to cover them. Bill took great care in preparing for one-on-one meetings. Remember, he believed the most important thing a manager does is to help people be more effective and to grow and develop, and the 1:1 is the best opportunity to accomplish that. Once he became a full-time coach, he varied his approach to suit the person he was coaching. But as a CEO he developed a standard format, which is what he always taught others. He always started with the「small talk,」but in Bill’s case, the talk wasn’t really that small. Oftentimes, small talk in a work environment is cursory: a quick「how are the kids?」or chatter about the morning commute before moving on to the business stuff. Conversations with Bill were more meaningful and layered; you sometimes got the feeling that the conversation about life was more the point of the meeting than the business topics. In fact, while his interest in people’s lives was quite sincere, it had a powerful benefit: a 2010 study concludes that having these sort of「substantive」conversations, as opposed to truly small talk, makes people happier.12

From the (not so) small talk, Bill moved to performance: What are you working on? How is it going? How could he help? Then, we would always get to peer relationships, which Bill thought were more important than relationships with your manager and other higher-ups.

One day, Jonathan spent part of his 1:1 with Bill talking about how he wasn’t getting any feedback from the founders on his work. What do they want? he wondered. Bill’s response was that Jonathan should not worry about top-down feedback; rather, he should pay attention to input from his peers. What do your teammates think of you? That’s what’s important! They proceeded to talk about Jonathan’s peers, how they generally appreciated the work he was doing, and what he could do better.

From peer relationships, Bill would move on to teams. He always wanted to know, were we setting a clear direction for them, and constantly reinforcing it? Did we understand what they were doing? If they were off on something, we would discuss how we could course correct them and get them back on track.「Think that everyone who works for you is like your kids,」Bill once said.「Help them course correct, make them better.」

Then he’d want to talk about innovation. Were we making space for it on our teams? How were we balancing the inherent tension between innovation and execution? Either alone wasn’t good; striking that balance was critical.

Besides having a detailed communications approach, Bill had strong opinions about being good at communicating. He was mostly old-school about it, preferring face-to-face conversations, or a phone call if that wasn’t possible. (「You shouldn’t wait four weeks to schedule a meeting,」he said.「Just get on the phone.」) In his CEO days at GO, if you got an email from Bill it was a big deal. Later, when he was coach to people all over the valley, he spent evenings returning the calls of people who had left messages throughout the day. When you left Bill a voice mail, you always got a call back.

He was also great at email. The tendency today is to have cascading emails, a senior person sending something to her staff, who write their own version to their people, and so on. Bill always counseled us to have one email, straight from the senior person, and over the years he practically perfected the art of writing those messages. In researching this book we reread all of the emails we got from Bill over the years and were constantly impressed by just how well written they all were: concise, clear, and compassionate. (When Jonathan’s father passed away, Bill wrote,「I am so sorry that I didn’t get to know him. He would be very proud of his loving son . . .」)

He expected similar quality from everyone around him. Nirav Tolia, the cofounder and CEO of Nextdoor, a social networking site and app for neighborhoods, first met Bill in the summer of 2000, when Nirav was leading a hot dot-com called Epinions. Bill Gurley connected the two of them, and during their first meeting Nirav got a lesson in Bill’s approach to communications.「I had a deck prepared for him, and I always put quotes in my decks, stuff from Churchill or similar. So I go through the deck and he let me be the peacock for a while. Finally he stops me. ‘Why do you have all those quotes in there?’ he wanted to know. ‘You haven’t told me anything about Epinions.’」He pushed Nirav to scrap the quotes altogether. Just talk about what’s going on and what needs to be done.

「Back then, I was ninety percent style, ten percent substance,」Nirav remembers.「Bill was one hundred percent substance.」

THE THRONE BEHIND THE ROUND TABLE

At one point late in Eric’s tenure as CEO of Google, he encountered something familiar to many executives: a turf war. One of his managers wanted his team to develop a mobile app for his product’s users, but another manager thought that his team should be the one developing the app. The argument went on for weeks and was progressing from affable to acrimonious. When his team was confronted with a challenging decision, Eric liked to use a management technique he called the「rule of two.」He would get the two people most closely involved in the decision to gather more information and work together on the best solution, and usually they would come back a week or two later having decided together on the best course of action. The team almost always agreed with their recommendation, because it was usually quite obvious that it was the best idea. The rule of two not only generates the best solution in most cases, it also promotes collegiality. It empowers the two people who are working on the issue to figure out ways to solve the problem, a fundamental principle of successful mediation.13 And it forms a habit of working together to resolve conflict that pays off with better camaraderie and decision making for years afterward.*14

This time around, it wasn’t happening. The two executives were dug in. When Eric asked Bill for advice, he replied,「You say, all right, either you two break that tie, or I will.」Eric took Bill’s advice, giving the two managers another week to come to an agreement. They failed, so Eric stepped in and made the decision.

Bill believed that one of a manager’s main jobs is to facilitate decisions, and he had a particular framework for doing so. He didn’t encourage democracy. (Before he arrived at Intuit, they took votes in meetings. Bill stopped that practice.) Rather, he favored an approach not unlike that used in improv comedy. In improv, the entire cast is at risk and needs to work together to continue a conversation, to put off the finality of a scene until the last possible moment. Bill encouraged ensembles and always strived for a politics-free environment. A place where the top manager makes all decisions leads to just the opposite, because people will spend their time trying to convince the manager that their idea is the best. In that scenario, it’s not about the best idea carrying the day, it’s about who does the best job of lobbying the top dog. In other words, politics.

Bill hated that. He believed in striving for the best idea, not consensus (「I hate consensus!」he would growl), intuitively understanding what numerous academic studies have shown: that the goal of consensus leads to「groupthink」and inferior decisions.15 The way to get the best idea, he believed, was to get all of the opinions and ideas out in the open, on the table for the group to discuss. Air the problem honestly, and make sure people have the opportunity to provide their authentic opinions, especially if they are dissenting. If the problem or decision at hand is more functional in nature (for example, primarily a marketing or finance decision), then the discussion should be led by the person with that functional expertise. When it is a broader decision cutting across multiple functional areas, then the team leader owns the discussion. Regardless, it should involve everyone’s point of view.

To get those ideas on the table, Bill would often sit down with individuals before the meeting to find out what they were thinking. This enabled Bill to understand the different perspectives, but more important, it gave members of his team the chance to come into the room prepared to talk about their point of view. Discussing it with Bill helped gather their thoughts and ideas before the broader discussion. Maybe they would all be aligned by the time they got there, maybe not, but they had already thought through, and talked through, their own perspective and were ready to present it.

As people present and argue ideas, things may become heated. That’s to be expected and is fine. As Emil Michael, a Bill coachee and former CBO of Uber, says,「When a leader can get people past being passive-aggressive, then heated but honest arguments can happen.」If your team is working well and thinking company-first rather than me-first, then after the fireworks subside the best idea will likely emerge. How the leader frames this discussion matters: a 2016 study shows that when it is called a debate rather than a disagreement, participants are more likely to share information. They perceive that other participants are more receptive to dissenting opinions.16

The ensemble approach can be especially hard to implement when the manager in charge of the decision already knows what to do (or thinks she does). Marissa Mayer admits to having had this problem when she was at Google. Then one day Bill gave her a new rule: when she was discussing a decision with her team, she always had to be the last person to speak. You may know the answer and you may be right, he said, but when you just blurt it out, you have robbed the team of the chance to come together. Getting to the right answer is important, but having the whole team get there is just as important. So Marissa sat, uncharacteristically quiet, while her team debated issues. She didn’t like it, but it worked. She gained new respect for her team and their ability to handle problems.

When the best idea doesn’t emerge, it’s time for the manager to force the decision or make it herself.「A manager’s job is to break ties and make their people better,」Bill said.「We’re going to do it this way. Cut the shit. Done.」Bill learned this the hard way: in his days as an exec at Apple he had experienced the exact opposite, a place where decisions festered and the business suffered.「Apple went to its knees, you know, on those things. You had one division doing this, and another division doing that, and somebody else wanted to do this. People would come to my office and ask me to make the call, but I was the sales and marketing guy, I couldn’t break ties between different product groups, between the Apple II group and the Mac group. It was ugly, and nothing got done. That sat with me.」

Failure to make a decision can be as damaging as a wrong decision. There’s indecision in business all the time, because there’s no perfect answer. Do something, even if it’s wrong, Bill counseled. Having a well-run process to get to a decision is just as important as the decision itself, because it gives the team confidence and keeps everyone moving. Bruce Chizen, the former CEO of Adobe who worked with Bill at Claris, calls this「making decisions with integrity,」which means following a good process and always prioritizing what is the right thing for the business rather than any individual. Make the best decision you can, then move on.

Then, when you make the call, commit to it, and expect that everyone else do so as well. Dan Rosensweig, the CEO of Chegg, a digital learning platform company, once had a situation where he and his CFO had agreed on an important financial move, only to have the CFO try to back out because of a minor issue. Dan called Bill and asked, what should I do?

Bill told Dan about a similar situation he had once faced as CEO. Bill and his management team had decided on a particular strategy, but when Bill presented the strategy at the board meeting, his CFO, who had been on board with the plan, proclaimed that he didn’t agree with Bill. After the meeting, Bill asked the CFO to not come back. Even if he didn’t agree with the decision, he needed to commit to it. If he couldn’t, then he was no longer a member of the team.

This is consistent with the King Arthur round-table model of decision making that Bill described to Brad Smith when Brad became CEO of Intuit. (As Brad tells us this story, he points out the model of the legendary table, with a full complement of seated knights, that sits in the corner of his office.) If you have the right conversation, Bill counseled, then eight out of ten times people will reach the best conclusion on their own. But the other two times you need to make the hard decision and expect that everyone will rally around it.

There isn’t a head of that table, but there is a throne behind it.

* * *

THE THRONE BEHIND THE ROUND TABLE

THE MANAGER’S JOB IS TO RUN A DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THAT ENSURES ALL PERSPECTIVES GET HEARD AND CONSIDERED, AND, IF NECESSARY, TO BREAK TIES AND MAKE THE DECISION.

* * *

LEAD BASED ON FIRST PRINCIPLES

So how do you make that hard decision? When you are a manager trying to move your team toward making a decision, the room will be rife with opinions. Bill always counseled us to try to cut through those opinions and get to the heart of the matter. In any situation there are certain immutable truths upon which everyone can agree. These are the「first principles,」a popular phrase and concept around Silicon Valley. Every company and every situation has its set of them. You can argue opinions, but you generally can’t argue principles, since everyone has already agreed upon them. As Bill would point out, it’s the leader’s job, when faced with a tough decision, to describe and remind everyone of those first principles. As a result, the decision often becomes much easier to make.

Mike McCue was introduced to Bill not long after Mike had raised $250 million for his startup, Tellme Networks, in the 1999 heyday of the dot-com boom. Bill sat in on Tellme’s board meetings and some of Mike’s staff meetings, and counseled Mike on every important strategic decision he made, both at Tellme and Mike’s subsequent company, Flipboard. And since there were lots of strategic decisions to be made, Mike had plenty of opportunities to put into practice Bill’s recommendations to decide based on first principles. There was the time AT&T offered to pay tens of millions of dollars to license Tellme’s software. Tellme made the first cloud-based speech recognition platform for large businesses and provided the service that answered the phones when you called companies like FedEx, Fidelity, and American Airlines. The problem with the AT&T offer was that they wanted to create a competitive product to Tellme’s; in fact, the offer was contingent upon Tellme getting out of the cloud speech recognition business altogether. Oh, and if the deal didn’t happen, AT&T, who was at the time Tellme’s largest customer, would pull all of its business.

The deal had the potential to be lucrative and Tellme needed the money, so some members of the team were arguing to take it. They honestly thought it was the best decision to make. Mike disagreed, but he knew he wouldn’t be successful if he just pushed the team to turn it down. He might win the decision, but he would lose the team.

「They were all really smart people,」Mike says.「They had all graduated from great colleges and were great debaters, so there were a lot of opinions. I never went to college, there was no way I was going to win an argument with that group.」(Mike started working right out of high school to help his family after his father died when he was eighteen.) Furthermore, Mike had demoted himself to COO by then, bringing in former Cincinnati Bell executive John LaMacchia as CEO, and John was in favor of taking the AT&T deal.*

So Mike gave Bill a call, then took a walk along the railroad tracks that ran right outside of Tellme’s offices. He thought about the first principles involved in the decision. First: the company had a solid business model that was working. Was it smart to take on a new model–software licensing? Second: they had a good product that was, objectively, the best on the market and ahead of its time. Did they think AT&T could make a better product? Probably not. Mike convened the team and laid out these principles. Everyone agreed that they were correct, since they had been foundational for the company for a long time. The decision practically made itself. The meeting concluded in less than an hour, and the deal was off.*

Mike applied the same approach when he was negotiating the sale of Tellme to Microsoft in 2007. He was working directly with Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft at the time, and at one point the deal was on the verge of collapse because another company came in with an unsolicited offer that was higher than Microsoft’s. Mike talked to Bill, thought through the company’s first principles again, and realized that Microsoft was the best home for Tellme. He wanted to sell the company to Microsoft. He flew to Redmond, Washington, and walked into Ballmer’s office.「Are we going to get divorced before we even get married?」Steve asked Mike. No, Mike responded, and explained why selling the company to Microsoft was the right outcome. Plus, the two of them had already agreed to the basic terms, and Mike had every intent of honoring that agreement (another first principle: integrity). So from that point forward, Steve and Mike became partners in getting the deal completed, with a healthy dose of advice on both sides from Bill. Without Bill’s advice to rely on first principles, the deal wouldn’t have happened.

LEAD BASED ON FIRST PRINCIPLES

DEFINE THE「FIRST PRINCIPLES」FOR THE SITUATION, THE IMMUTABLE TRUTHS THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR THE COMPANY OR PRODUCT, AND HELP GUIDE THE DECISION FROM THOSE PRINCIPLES.

MANAGE THE ABERRANT GENIUS

Perhaps one of the most difficult problems facing managers is what to do with the diva, the person who’s a star performer but a pain to work with. We have certainly come across many of these people during our careers in high-tech, and Bill always reminded us that managing these people is one of the bigger challenges of the job. He called them「aberrant geniuses,」and said,「You get these quirky guys or women who are going to be great differentiators for you. It is your job to manage that person in a way that doesn’t disrupt the company. They have to be able to work with other people. If they can’t, you need to let them go. They need to work in an environment where they collaborate with other people.」

So how do you do this? Over the years, through lots of trial and error and with a lot of advice from Bill, we learned this particular art. Support them as they continue to perform, and minimize time spent fighting them. Instead, invest that energy in trying as hard as possible to coach them past their aberrant behavior. As long as you can do this successfully, the rewards can be tremendous: more genius, less aberrant.「He has everything that he needs,」Bill once wrote Jonathan about one of his problematic team members.「Now that you fully supported him, you should try to get him to behave as a leader. He has all of his space. No more arguments.」

In our experience, aberrant geniuses can be enormously valuable and productive. They can build great products and high-performing teams. They have quick insights. They are simply better in many, many ways. And they can have both the ego and the fragility to match their outsized talent and performance. They often put a lot of energy into personal gains at the expense of peer relationships. A me-first attitude sometimes creeps through (or barges in), which can cause resentment in others and affect their performance.


Here is where the art of balance comes in: there is aberrant behavior, and there is aberrant behavior. How much do you tolerate, and when is it too much? Where is that elusive boundary? Never put up with people who cross ethical lines: lying, lapses of integrity or ethics, harassing or mistreating colleagues. In a way, these are the easier cases, since the decision is so clear-cut. The harder cases are the ones where the person doesn’t cross these lines. How do you determine when the damage a person causes exceeds their considerable contributions? There’s no perfect answer to this, but there are a few warning signs. All of these are coachable, but if there’s no change, they shouldn’t be tolerated.

Does the aberrant genius break team communications? Does he interrupt others, or attack or rebuke them? Does he make people afraid to talk?

Does the aberrant genius suck up too much management time? It’s hard to know when an aberrant genius’s behavior has become too toxic for the team to bear, but if you are spending hours upon hours controlling the damage, that’s a good sign it’s gone too far. A lot of that time is usually spent arguing with the person, which is rarely constructive. One time Bill was coaching a Google manager about an aberrant genius on the team, and he summed up the situation neatly.「I don’t know why I’m defending him,」Bill noted,「except that his brilliance is one of the things that makes us great. How can we capture the good and dismiss the bad? You can’t be with him eighteen hours a day!」The eighteen-hours-a-day comment was an overstatement, but not a huge one; the person was requiring an inordinate amount of management damage control. He eventually left the company.*17

Does the aberrant genius have her priorities straight? Eccentric behavior can be okay as long as it is in the service (or intended to be in the service) of the good of the company. What can’t be tolerated is when the aberrant genius continually puts him- or herself above the team. This often crops up in areas that are adjacent to the core work of the group. The genius will continue to shine in the job, be it sales, product, legal, and so on. But when it comes to factors such as compensation, press, and promotion, this is where the aberrant pops up.

Does the aberrant genius seek too much attention and self-promotion? Bill wasn’t a fan of media attention and mistrusted the motivation of people who sought too much of it. Publicity is fine if it’s in the service of the company, and indeed, that is part of the CEO’s job. But if you are the CEO and someone on your team is consistently seeking coverage, that’s a warning sign. Aberrant geniuses may nominally give credit to their teams but still hog the spotlight. This can have a corrosive effect. People may say it’s okay, but over time they start to resent that one person seems to get a lot of credit and other, more humble, people, less. Seeking attention is one trait of narcissism, and a 2008 study demonstrates that, controlling for other factors, narcissists are more likely to emerge as group leaders.18 So having a leader who seeks too much attention maybe isn’t all that aberrant. But it can still be problematic if the rest of the team comes to suspect that the media star is more interested in the spotlight than the team’s success!

* * *

MANAGE THE ABERRANT GENIUS

ABERRANT GENIUSES—HIGH-PERFORMING BUT DIFFICULT TEAM MEMBERS—SHOULD BE TOLERATED AND EVEN PROTECTED, AS LONG AS THEIR BEHAVIOR ISN’T UNETHICAL OR ABUSIVE AND THEIR VALUE OUTWEIGHS THE TOLL THEIR BEHAVIOR TAKES ON MANAGEMENT, COLLEAGUES, AND TEAMS.

* * *

MONEY’S NOT ABOUT MONEY

Bill helped advise us on compensation issues at Google for many years, and he always advocated generosity. He understood something about compensation that many people do not: the money isn’t always about the money. For sure, everyone needs to be paid a fair salary that affords them a good lifestyle. For a great many people, the money is about the money.

But it’s also about something else. Compensation isn’t just about the economic value of the money; it’s about the emotional value. It’s a signaling device for recognition, respect, and status, and it ties people strongly to the goals of the company. Bill knew that everyone is human and needs to be appreciated, including people who are already financially secure. This is why the superstar athlete who is worth tens or hundreds of millions pushes for that next huge contract. It’s not for the money; it’s for the love.

COMPENSATING PEOPLE WELL DEMONSTRATES LOVE AND RESPECT AND TIES THEM STRONGLY TO THE GOALS OF THE COMPANY.

INNOVATION IS WHERE THE CRAZY PEOPLE HAVE STATURE

When Bill joined Kodak from J. Walter Thompson in 1980, he established himself, according to his Kodak colleague Eric Johnson, as a「virus.」He came in with a「Bill way of thinking, a fresh perspective,」Eric says.「How do we make things better for Kodak, the dealers, and the consumer?」

Although it may be hard for our under-forty readers to comprehend, there was a long stretch of time when Kodak practically owned photography. You bought a Kodak camera (some of you will remember your first Instamatic; we do!), filled it with Kodak film, and when you had shot all the film, you sent it to a Kodak lab to be processed. By 1976, the company sold 90 percent of the film used in the United States and 85 percent of the cameras.*19 So when Bill arrived on the scene in Rochester, he entered a world of unquestioned dominance.

At the time, Kodak’s biggest competitor was Fuji, a Japanese company that was starting to challenge Kodak’s global hegemony in film. Not long after Bill joined the company, Fuji came out with a film that it promoted as having better quality. And it wasn’t just marketing hype—the film actually was better. It was faster, so it could take pictures with less light or a faster shutter speed without compromising the quality of the image. Bill and his colleagues in marketing were talking about this new competitive issue one day, when Bill suggested something. How about we go over to the research lab and talk to the engineers? Maybe they can come up with something better, too.

This was not how things worked at Kodak. Marketing guys didn’t go talk to engineers, especially the engineers in the research lab. But Bill didn’t know that, or if he did, he didn’t particularly care. So he went over to the building that housed the labs, introduced himself around, and challenged them to come up with something better than Fuji’s latest. That challenge helped start the ball rolling on the film that eventually launched as Kodacolor 200, a major product for Kodak and a film that was empirically better than Fuji’s. Score one for the marketing guy and his team!

Bill started his business career as an advertising and marketing guy, then added sales to his portfolio after joining Apple. But through his experiences in the tech world, in his stints at Apple, Intuit, Google, and others, Bill came to appreciate the preeminence of technology and product in the business pecking order.「The purpose of a company is to take the vision you have of the product and bring it to life,」he said once at a conference.「Then you put all the other components around it—finance, sales, marketing—to get the product out the door and make sure it’s successful.」This was not the way things were done in Silicon Valley, or most other places, when Bill came to town in the 1980s. The model then was that while a company might be started by a technologist, pretty soon the powers that be would bring in a business guy, with experience in sales, marketing, finance, or operations, to run the place. These executives wouldn’t be thinking about the needs of the engineers and weren’t focused on product first. Bill was a business guy, but he believed that nothing was more important than an empowered engineer. His constant point: product teams are the heart of the company. They are the ones who create new features and new products.

The ultimate objective of product teams is to create great product market fit. If you have the right product for the right market at the right time, then go full steam ahead. Eddy Cue, an Apple executive who helped create the App Store, recalls that when he first presented the concept of the store to the Apple board, Bill quickly grasped the bigger picture of how important it was. It seemed to some like it was something that was merely nice to have, but Bill realized its immense potential.「Others were asking nuts-and-bolts questions about how it worked,」Eddy says,「while Bill’s questions were all about how we can move faster.」This was a constant theme from Bill and something he preached to us and others: if you have the right product for the right market at the right time, go as fast as you can. There are minor things that will go wrong and you have to fix them quickly, but speed is essential.

This means that finance, sales, or marketing shouldn’t tell the product teams what to do. Instead, these groups can supply intelligence on what customer problems need solving, and what opportunities they see.*20 They describe the market part of「product market fit.」Then they stand by, let the product teams work, and clear the way of things that might slow them down. As Bill often commented,「Why is marketing losing its clout? Because it forgot its first name: product.」

Bill liked to tell a story about when he was at Intuit and they started getting into banking products. They hired some product managers with banking experience. One day, Bill was at a meeting with one of those product managers, who presented his engineers with a list of features he wanted them to build. Bill told the poor product manager, if you ever tell an engineer at Intuit which features you want, I’m going to throw you out on the street. You tell them what problem the consumer has. You give them context on who the consumer is. Then let them figure out the features. They will provide you with a far better solution than you’ll ever get by telling them what to build.

This does not mean you let engineers run off, unfettered, doing whatever they please. To the contrary, product teams need to partner with those other teams from the outset, integrated into a cross-functional group that pushes forward with new ideas that solve problems and hatch opportunities. Remember, Bill was the marketing guy who literally walked down the street to work with engineers on a problem. It does mean that the engineers (and other people creating products) have clout, and that they need to be given some freedom. Ron Sugar, an Apple board member and former CEO of Northrop Grumman, says,「Bill helped me understand that in a company like Apple, the degree of independence of creative thinking, of being not so conformist, is a strength. You need to embrace that nonconformist streak.」

When Bill was CEO of Intuit, he met with all the engineering directors for lunch every Friday, where they’d spend a couple of hours over pizza talking about what they were doing and what was slowing them down. For a non-techie, Bill did a good job getting into details with the geeks; the execs need to be able to talk to the engineers, even if they aren’t engineering execs. And the geeks knew they had the CEO’s attention every week. This is how he ensured that they had stature.

INNOVATION IS WHERE THE CRAZY PEOPLE HAVE STATURE

THE PURPOSE OF A COMPANY IS TO BRING A PRODUCT VISION TO LIFE. ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS ARE IN SERVICE TO PRODUCT.

* * *

HEADS HELD HIGH

In business, layoffs and firings are inevitable, perhaps more so in the world of startups and technology. Bill’s point of view on this was that letting people go is a failure of management, not one of any of the people who are being let go. So it is important for management to let people leave with their heads held high. Treat them well, with respect. Be generous with severance packages. Send out a note internally celebrating their accomplishments.

Bill would actually practice these scenarios with his coachees. Shishir Mehrotra, whom Bill coached throughout his career, once had to fire one of his engineering leads at a startup where he was working. Before Shishir had the conversation with the person, he and Bill walked through how he was going to conduct the meeting, line by line, even thinking through the practical details of who would sit where in the conference room. Be clear about it early in the conversation, Bill said. Go through your reasoning and provide details. Shishir knew that the move was going to be a surprise to the engineer, for which Bill scolded him.「Bill told me that I had screwed up,」Shishir says.「It shouldn’t have been a surprise.」

As Ben Horowitz notes in his book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things, treating the departing people well is important for the morale and well-being of the remaining team.「Many of the people whom you lay off will have closer relationships with the people who stay than you do, so treat them with the appropriate level of respect. Still, the company must move forward, so be careful not to apologize too much.」Research confirms this point: laid-off employees care about who’s doing the layoffs, and how good an explanation they get. Doing layoffs properly has a positive impact on both the people being laid off and the people who stay on with the company.21

Firing people (terminating someone for performance issues) demands a similar level of respect. It has to be done sometimes, and it’s tough. Bill would tell us,「When you fire someone, you feel terrible for about a day, then you say to yourself that you should have done it sooner. No one ever succeeds at their third chance.」If you’ve ever had the crappy task of firing someone, and you think back on that experience, you will realize that this is absolutely correct. But again, you must let people leave with their heads held high.

As Bill once told Ben Horowitz about a departing executive:「Ben, you cannot let him keep his job, but you absolutely can let him keep his respect.」22

BILL ON BOARDS

Imagine for a moment you are a member of the Apple board of directors. It is the late 2000s, and you have just completed a long day at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, reviewing financial information and getting an advance look at the latest in a string of dazzling new products. You are tired but excited; remember, about a decade ago this company was almost bankrupt! You, your fellow board members, and a handful of Apple execs travel to a sushi restaurant called Mitsunobu in nearby Menlo Park to relax and have some fun after a busy day. It’s a big enough group that you have to split up into a couple of tables in a private dining room. You have a glass of wine and are enjoying some tasty salmon sashimi while you discuss serious things with the distinguished people at your table.

Suddenly, a burst of laughter from the other table interrupts the placid atmosphere, followed by a shout, then another outburst. Annoyed, you look over just as Bill Campbell throws his napkin across the table at Al Gore, who grabs it off his forehead and throws it right back. Bill continues the story he was telling, as Al and the rest of the table burst out laughing again. It’s like a holiday supper where you are sitting with the other adults, while the other table, full of kids, has all the fun. I wish I were sitting with them, you think.

Bill Campbell knew how to have fun. He made every table the kids’ table, even at dinners following board meetings, which are usually sedate (aka boring) affairs. Bill was only officially on a few boards (including Apple’s), but he participated informally in many others and had plenty of experience managing them as a CEO at Claris, GO, and Intuit. He knew how to occasionally have fun with boards, but he also developed a strong set of guidelines on how CEOs should work with their boards to get the most out of them. A good, effective board can be a tremendous asset to a company, while a weak one just sucks up time. Getting this right matters, and whether or not you are a CEO with the responsibility to manage a board, his approach provides good insights for managing any kind of big meeting of people who are short on time and long on ego.

Bill’s perspective on boards starts with this observation: the CEO manages the board and board meetings, not the other way around.*23 Board meetings fail when the CEO doesn’t own and follow her agenda. That agenda should always start with operational updates: the board needs to know how the company is doing. That includes financial and sales reports, product status, and metrics around operational rigor (hiring, communications, marketing, support). If the board has committees, for example to oversee audit and finance or compensation, have those committees meet ahead of time (in person or via phone or video conference) and present updates at the board meeting. The first order of business always needs to be a frank, open, succinct discussion about how the company is performing.

Much of this material can be sent to board members ahead of time, with the idea that they will review it and be up-to-date on most stuff when they come to the meeting. If you throw a full set of financial reports up on a screen in a board meeting, they will want to talk about it forever, and you end up getting bogged down in operational details that probably don’t need the board’s attention. Send out financial and other operational details ahead of time and expect board members to review them and come with questions.

And when we say expect, we mean expect: board members who don’t do their homework shouldn’t stick around. Dan Rosensweig once had a guy on his board at Chegg who wouldn’t read anything ahead of the board meeting and then spent a lot of time at the meeting asking about details that were in his preread. At one board meeting, Dan got angry at him for wasting everyone’s time. Afterward, Bill, who was at the meeting, told Dan that he shouldn’t lose his cool like that. Send the guy an information packet a week ahead of time and tell him exactly which pages you are going to cover in the meeting and exactly what you expect him to do. So that’s what Dan did. And the same thing happened: the guy showed up unprepared and wasted a lot of time asking questions about things he should have known already.

Yeah, I was wrong, Bill told Dan afterward. Fire him.

In our board meetings at Google, Bill always pushed Eric to ensure that the operations review included a thorough set of highlights and lowlights. Here’s what we did well and what we’re proud of; here’s what we didn’t do so well. The highlights were always easy to compile; teams love dressing up their best successes and presenting them to the board. But the lowlights, not so much. It can take some prodding to make teams be completely frank about where they are falling short, and indeed, Eric often rejected an initial draft of the board lowlights for not being honest enough. He was dogged in ensuring that the lowlights were authentic, and as a result, the board would see the bad news along with the good.

Creating a robust set of real lowlights might entail giving honest updates on things ranging from revenue growth and product limitations to employee attrition and concerns about the pace of innovation. A 2002 Harvard Business Review article notes that a「virtuous cycle of respect, trust, and candor」is one thing that makes「great boards great.」24 And this level of honesty sets a tone of transparency and honesty that reverberates throughout the company. A company that is honest with its board can be honest with itself, too; people learn that not only is it okay to frankly share bad news, it’s expected. Determining lowlights is an important task, something to be handled by people running the business, not left to support functions such as finance or communications. At Google, we had product managers handle the task.

But . . . we would not include the highlights and lowlights in the packet of information that we sent to board members ahead of the meeting. If you do that, they will spend too much time obsessing about the lowlights and will want to start the meeting there.

Who should be on the board? Smart people with good business expertise who care deeply about the company and are genuinely interested in helping and supporting the CEO. When Dick Costolo took the role of CEO of Twitter, the board consisted of several venture capitalists, some members of the founding team, and Dick. Bill helped Dick change that and bring in more people with lots of expertise in actually running businesses. You need some other operators to lean on, he told Dick.

He was also quite clear about what a bad board member looks like:「Someone who just walks in and wants to be the smartest guy in the room and talks too much.」

BILL ON BOARDS

IT’S THE CEO’S JOB TO MANAGE BOARDS, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

* * *

We talk more in subsequent chapters about Bill’s role as a coach, at Google and numerous other companies, and about how he made an enormous impact in this unique role. But he also had tremendous acumen as an executive. Remember, this was a guy who went from college football coach to senior executive at a Fortune 500 company in less than five years. He was a superb business executive. And he did it through practicing the points covered in this chapter: operational excellence, putting people first, being decisive, communicating well, knowing how to get the most out of even the most challenging people, focusing on product excellence, and treating people well when they are let go.

# Chapter 3 Build an Envelope of Trust

At one point when Bill Campbell was CEO of Intuit, the company was having a rough quarter and it looked like it might not make its revenue and profit objectives. When the board got together to discuss what to do about it, most of its members were willing to tolerate missing short-term financial targets, as they felt it was more important for the company to invest in the future. Short-term objectives weren’t as important as long-term growth, which might be sacrificed if spending was curtailed. Bill disagreed. He wanted to get leaner and make the numbers. That is the culture we want to have around here, he explained. It wasn’t so much about hitting those short-term numbers, but about creating a culture where anything less than operational excellence wouldn’t be tolerated. He felt it was management’s job to deliver results, not just for shareholders but for the team and customers. The board wanted to focus on the long run by investing; Bill knew that he was also investing in the long-term success of the company by instilling strong operational discipline.

This particular moment was shaping up as an unusual disagreement between a forgiving board and a disciplined former football coach turned CEO. As the conversation moved around the room, most of the board members wanted to spend their way through the crisis, to invest in the future. They disagreed with their CEO. Finally, it was John Doerr’s turn to weigh in.「You know,」he said,「I think we should back the coach.」John says that was the moment when he earned Bill Campbell’s trust.「The board may have been correct,」he says.「But isn’t the real right answer to back your CEO?」It almost didn’t matter what the debate was about; it was something that Bill felt passionate about, and John decided to bet on Bill. He trusted him.

Perhaps the most important currency in a relationship—friendship, romantic, familial, or professional—is trust. This was certainly true with Bill Campbell. If Bill didn’t trust you, you didn’t have a relationship with him. But if he did trust you, and vice versa, that trust was the basis for all other aspects of the relationship. Trust is of course important for any relationship, but in most business relationships it takes its place alongside other factors: personal agendas, mutual exchange of value. For Bill, trust was always first and foremost; it was sort of his superpower. He was great at establishing it, and once established, he was great at honoring it. In one of the last times they saw each other, Bill told Alan Eustace,「You know I would do anything for you.」He meant it, because of the trust between them.

Trust is a multifaceted concept, so what do we mean by it? One academic paper defines trust as「the willingness to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations about another’s behavior.」1 That’s a bit of an academic mouthful, but it captures the essential point that trust means people feel safe to be vulnerable. When we are referring to Bill and trust, it means a few things.

Trust means you keep your word. If you told Bill you were going to do something, you did it. And the same applied to him; his word was always good.

Trust means loyalty. To each other, to your family and friends, and to your team and company. Bill was one of the few Apple executives to fight to keep Steve Jobs when he was let go from the company in 1985. Steve never forgot that expression of loyalty, which later became the basis for their close friendship and working relationship.

Trust means integrity. Bill was always honest, and he expected the same in return. And it means ability, the trust that you actually had the talent, skills, power, and diligence to accomplish what you promised.

Trust means discretion. When Eric was CEO of Google, one of his team members was diagnosed with a serious medical condition (he later fully recovered) but chose not to share it with Eric or the rest of the team. The only person who knew was Bill, who told no one. Eric later found out, and rather than be annoyed that Bill kept the information from him, he was happy to learn that Bill was so trustworthy. Bill could keep a secret, even from Eric, and so could act as a confidant to anyone on the team. This is very valuable to a coach, who always needs to know what’s going on, but also needs to be seen by his coachees as someone who honors their privacy.

Perhaps the idea that trust is a cornerstone of business success belongs in the「well duh, Captain Obvious」bucket. But it is missing from many of today’s business books, and it never came up as a factor in Google’s success when we were researching and writing our previous book, How Google Works. So it was somewhat of a surprise to us that when we interviewed the dozens of successful businesspeople Bill had mentored, the word came up again and again. Dean Gilbert, a former executive at Google and @Home, and an accomplished management coach in his own right, notes that「Bill would build an envelope of trust very quickly. It was a natural thing for him, this ability to build rapport, a sense of comfort and protection. It’s the cornerstone of any coaching in business.」Vinod Khosla, a Sun Microsystems cofounder and head of Khosla Ventures, says that he and Bill「built a great relationship around trust, whether we agreed or disagreed.」An important point: trust doesn’t mean you always agree; in fact, it makes it easier to disagree with someone. These are just a couple of the numerous quotes we could cite from people who worked with Bill, all of them basically saying the same thing: You could trust Bill. His success stemmed from that.

A slew of academic research bears out what Bill intuitively knew—not just that trust is important, but that it is the first thing to create if you want a relationship to be successful. It is the foundation. For example, a highly cited 2000 study from Cornell University discusses the correlation between task conflict (disagreements about decisions) and relationship conflict (emotional friction) in teams. Task conflict is healthy and is important to get to the best decisions, but it is highly correlated with relationship conflict, which leads to poorer decisions and morale. What to do? Build trust first, the study concludes. Teams that trust each other will still have disagreements, but when they do, they will be accompanied by less emotional rancor.2

Most business people, when they meet, get right to the task at hand. There’s stuff to do! This is especially true in technology, technologists not being noted for their high EQs or social skills. In our world, the attitude is often first prove to me how smart you are, then maybe I’ll trust you, or at least your intellect. Bill took a different, more patient approach. He started relationships by getting to know the person, beyond their résumé and skill set. Shishir Mehrotra notes that Bill「walked among a set of driven technologists, but he saw the world in a completely different way . . . He saw it as a network of people, learning each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and learning to trust each other as a primary mechanism of achieving goals.」

Trust is also an important theme among the best sports coaches (and was the subject of Bill’s pregame talk to the Stanford football team, when he was made honorary captain for a game in 2012). Red Auerbach, who as a coach and executive led the Boston Celtics to sixteen NBA championships in thirty years (including a remarkable eight straight), had a simple way of expressing the importance of trust:「The players won’t con me because I don’t con them.」3 He believed that level of trust led to stability and to greater commitment from his players:「When players find themselves in a situation where management has a great deal of integrity and they can depend on my word or anybody else’s word in the organization, they feel secure. And if the players feel secure, they don’t want to leave here. And if they don’t want to leave here, they’re going to do everything they can on the court to stay here.」

Establishing trust is a key component to building what is now called「psychological safety」in teams. Team psychological safety, according to a 1999 Cornell study, is a「shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking . . . a team climate . . . in which people are comfortable being themselves.」4 This is exactly the feeling we experienced when working with Bill; he quickly established a relationship where we could be ourselves, without fear. Not surprisingly, when Google conducted a study to determine the factors behind high-performing teams, psychological safety came out at the top of the list.* The common notions that the best teams are made up of people with complementary skill sets or similar personalities were disproven; the best teams are the ones with the most psychological safety. And that starts with trust.

It’s hard to disagree with the notion that trust is essential for productive relationships. But in the high-stakes, big-ego world of business executives, it is easier said than done (especially when you remember that our protagonist, Coach Bill, had quite a healthy ego of his own and the opinions and stubbornness to match). How did Bill do it? First, he only coached the coachable. Then, if you passed that test, he listened intently, practiced complete candor, believed that his coachees could achieve remarkable things, and was intensely loyal.

ONLY COACH THE COACHABLE

On a January day in 2002, Jonathan drove over to the Google office in Mountain View, where he thought he was going to pick up a formal job offer to become head of the growing Google product team. He thought the job was a lock, but once he arrived, he was escorted to a plain conference room where a gruff, older guy greeted him. It was the first time Jonathan met Bill. He couldn’t quite remember who Bill was, and did not realize, at least at first, that this guy was the final gateway on the road to employment at the company. No problem, thought Jonathan, I’m a pretty big deal, SVP from a successful tech company, @Home. I got this!

Bill looked at Jonathan for what seemed like minutes, then told him that he had spoken with a few of the principals from @Home: its cofounder Tom Jermoluk; its first CEO, William Randolph Hearst III; and one of its investors, John Doerr, who was also on Google’s board. The consensus, Bill reported, was that Jonathan was smart and worked hard. Jonathan’s chest puffed a bit.

「But I don’t care about any of that,」Bill said.「I only have one question: Are you coachable?」

Jonathan instantly, and regrettably, replied:「It depends on the coach.」

Wrong answer.

「Smart alecks are not coachable,」Bill snapped. He stood up to leave, interview over, as it dawned on Jonathan that he had heard Eric Schmidt was getting coaching from someone and, oh my God, this must be the guy. Jonathan switched from smart-aleck mode to groveling mode, backing away from his quip (which wasn’t exactly a quip), and asked Bill to continue the conversation. After another moment that felt like minutes, Bill sat back down and talked about how he chose the people he was going to work with based on humility. Leadership is not about you, it’s about service to something bigger: the company, the team. Bill believed that good leaders grow over time, that leadership accrues to them from their teams. He thought people who were curious and wanted to learn new things were best suited for this. There was no room in this formula for smart alecks and their hubris.

Bill then asked,「What do you want to get out of a coach?」

This felt like, and indeed was, a change-your-life-forever moment. And Jonathan couldn’t think of anything to say. Finally and fortunately, in what football fans might call a Hail Mary play, he remembered a quote from Tom Landry, who coached the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys for twenty-nine years, a stint that included twenty straight winning seasons and two Super Bowl titles.「A coach is someone who tells you what you don’t want to hear, who has you see what you don’t want to see, so you can be who you have always known you could be.」That’s what I want, Jonathan told Bill.

It worked. Jonathan not only got the job, he got the coach he didn’t think he needed, but sorely did.

People who want to get the best out of a coaching relationship need to be coachable. Bill’s approach to coaching was rooted in his mind-set that almost all people have value, not based on their title or role but on who they are. His job was to make them better. But only if they were coachable. And, Jonathan’s experience notwithstanding, that was based on a lot more than the ability to pull a pithy quote out of the ether (or nether) in a pinch.

The traits of coachability Bill sought were honesty and humility, the willingness to persevere and work hard, and a constant openness to learning. Honesty and humility because a successful coaching relationship requires a high degree of vulnerability, much more than is typical in a business relationship. Coaches need to learn how self-aware a coachee is; they need to not only understand the coachee’s strengths and weaknesses, but also understand how well the coachee understands his or her own strengths and weaknesses. Where are they honest with themselves, and where are their blind spots? And then it is the coach’s job to raise that self-awareness further and to help them see the flaws they don’t see for themselves. People don’t like to talk about these flaws, which is why honesty and humility are so important. If people can’t be honest with themselves and their coach, and if they aren’t humble enough to recognize how they aren’t perfect, they won’t get far in that relationship.

Humility, because Bill believed that leadership is about service to something that is bigger than you: your company, your team. Today the concept of「servant leadership」is in vogue and has been directly linked to stronger company performance.*5 Bill believed and practiced it well before it became popular. The coachable people are the ones who can see that they are part of something bigger than themselves. You can have a considerable ego and still be part of an even bigger cause. This is one reason Bill threw himself into coaching people at Google. He foresaw that the company had the potential to have a big impact in the world, to indeed be far bigger in every way than any of its individual execs.

The flip side of the honest, humble person is the bullshitter.「Bill couldn’t stand BSers,」John Hennessy says. He’s the former president of Stanford University who worked closely with Bill on several fronts. Bill’s opposition to bullshitters wasn’t as much about their dishonesty with others as it was about their dishonesty with themselves. To be coachable, you need to be brutally honest, starting with yourself. As Hennessy says,「People who generate a lot of BS aren’t coachable. They start to believe what they are saying. They shade the truth to conform to their BS, which makes the BS even more dangerous.」

Perhaps this intolerance came from Bill’s football days. As Hennessy puts it,「There’s no room for BS on the football field!」

THE TRAITS THAT MAKE A PERSON COACHABLE INCLUDE HONESTY AND HUMILITY, THE WILLINGNESS TO PERSEVERE AND WORK HARD, AND A CONSTANT OPENNESS TO LEARNING.

PRACTICE FREE-FORM LISTENING

In a coaching session with Bill, you could expect that he would listen intently. No checking his phone for texts or email, no glancing at his watch or out the window while his mind wandered. He was always right there. Today it is popular to talk about「being present」or「in the moment.」We’re pretty sure those words never passed the coach’s lips, yet he was one of their great practitioners. Al Gore says he learned from Bill how「important it is to pay careful attention to the person you are dealing with . . . give them your full, undivided attention, really listening carefully. Only then do you go into the issue. There’s an order to it.」

Alan Eustace called Bill’s approach「free-form listening」—academics might call it「active listening,」a term first coined in 19576—and in practicing it Bill was following the advice of the great UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, who felt that poor listening was a trait shared by many leaders:「We’d all be a lot wiser if we listened more,」Wooden said,「not just hearing the words, but listening and not thinking about what we’re going to say.」7

Bill’s listening was usually accompanied by a lot of questions, a Socratic approach. A 2016 Harvard Business Review article notes that this approach of asking questions is essential to being a great listener:「People perceive the best listeners to be those who periodically ask questions that promote discovery and insight.」8

「Bill would never tell me what to do,」says Ben Horowitz.「Instead he’d ask more and more questions, to get to what the real issue was.」Ben found an important lesson in Bill’s technique that he applies today when working with his fund’s CEOs. Often, when people ask for advice, all they are really asking for is approval.「CEOs always feel like they need to know the answer,」Ben says.「So when they ask me for advice, I’m always getting a prepared question. I never answer those.」Instead, like Bill, he asks more questions, trying to understand the multiple facets of a situation. This helps him get past the prepared question (and answer) and discover the heart of an issue.

Listening well helps ensure that all ideas and perspectives get surfaced. Jerry Kaplan tells a story in Startup, his book about GO, about how the management team decided to shift the architecture of their computing system from Intel-based processors to RISC-based ones. (RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer. Today, most computers are RISC-based, as are most smartphones.)

Bill was the CEO, but as Jerry tells the story, this major strategic decision emerged from a rowdy management meeting where Bill teed up the problem (they were starting to compete with Microsoft, so perhaps they should「go where they aren’t」) and let his team throw out the best ideas. They argued for a while and were initially incredulous when Mike Homer, who had worked with Bill at Apple (and became a lifelong friend), came up with the idea to shift processors, and Robert Carr, the company’s cofounder and head of software, suggested RISC. But it gradually became obvious that the new idea was the best, so that’s what they did.9

When you listen to people, they feel valued. A 2003 study from Lund University in Sweden finds that「mundane, almost trivial」things like listening and chatting with employees are important aspects of successful leadership, because「people feel more respected, visible and less anonymous, and included in teamwork.」10 And a 2016 paper finds that this form of「respectful inquiry,」where the leader asks open questions and listens attentively to the response, is effective because it heightens the「follower’s」feelings of competence (feeling challenged and experiencing mastery), relatedness (feeling of belonging), and autonomy (feeling in control and having options). Those three factors are sort of the holy trinity of the self-determination theory of human motivation, originally developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan.11

As Salar Kamangar, an early Google executive, puts it,「Bill was uplifting. No matter what we discussed, I felt heard, understood, and supported.」*

NO GAP BETWEEN STATEMENTS AND FACT

One day Bill dropped by Dan Rosensweig’s office at Chegg. Dan had just given an upbeat presentation at the board meeting. The company, which had been on the verge of going under, was in a much more stable position. Not growing, but at least not failing. Dan and his team were in a celebratory mood.

Bill walked into the office sporting a green eyeshade, the kind accountants used to wear in the early parts of the twentieth century to reduce eye strain. He went around the office space, greeting people at their desks before eventually arriving at Dan’s door. Congratulations, he said, you saved the company. You are now the most successful nongrowth CEO in the valley! The accountants may be happy, but that’s about it, because that’s not what you came here to do, is it? He hugged Dan, then chucked the eyeshade at him. Dan realized in that moment that he had solved only one problem, a big one, but Bill was right. Dan didn’t want to just save the company, he wanted to grow it. The truth was a bit of a slap in the face, but it was time to get back to work.

Bill was always 100 percent honest (he told the truth) and candid (he wasn’t afraid to offer a harsh opinion). A straight shooter if there ever was one. Google board member and former Amazon executive Ram Shriram:「Bill was always transparent; there was no hidden agenda. There was no gap between his statements and fact. They were always the same.」Intuit cofounder Scott Cook:「He really taught me about honesty and authenticity in giving feedback. You can keep someone’s respect and loyalty while delivering tough news about their performance.」

Bill’s candor worked because we always knew it was coming from a place of caring. Former Googler Kim Scott, author of the excellent book Radical Candor, says that being a great boss means「saying what you really think in a way that still lets people know you care.」12 In the Dan Rosensweig anecdote, for example, Bill accomplishes this with humor, delivering a tough message (nongrowth CEO) with a funny prop (green eyeshade). You’d have to care to wear that thing!

An important component of providing candid feedback is not to wait.「A coach coaches in the moment,」Scott Cook says.「It’s more real and more authentic, but so many leaders shy away from that.」Many managers wait until performance reviews to provide feedback, which is often too little, too late. Bill’s feedback was in the moment (or very close to it), task specific, and always followed by a grin and a hug, all of which helped remove the sting.

He’d also make sure that if the feedback was critical, to deliver it in private. Diane Greene, the head of Google Cloud and former VMware CEO who worked with Bill when they were on the board at Intuit, learned from Bill to never embarrass someone publicly.「When I’m really annoyed or frustrated with what someone is doing,」she says,「I step back and force myself to think about what they are doing well and what their value is. You can always find something. If we’re in public, I’ll praise them on that. I’ll give constructive feedback as soon as I can, but only when the person is feeling safe. Once they are feeling safe and supported, then I’ll say ‘by the way’ and provide the feedback. I got this from Bill. He would always do this in a supportive way.」

Pat Gallagher was in the front office of the San Francisco Giants for many years before they moved into the beautiful AT&T Park and won three world championships. He was Bill’s neighbor and friend, but also a recipient of some of his legendary candor. You’re the marketing guy with the worst ballpark in America (the regrettable Candlestick Park, the team’s previous home) and a shitty team, Bill told Pat (we assume Pat was in a safe place at the time!). You’d better do everything you can to make the customer experience great! It’s all you’ve got.

Jesse Rogers has a similar story. He became Bill’s friend because their kids went to Sacred Heart together, but became his coachee as he was trying to decide if he should leave his job and strike out on his own. The two talked about it a lot, and Jesse decided to make the jump. A few weeks later, as he was getting set up in his new office, he sent Bill the link to the brand-new website of the firm he had cofounded, Altamont Capital. A few minutes later, Jesse’s phone rang. He expected some nice words of congratulations, a verbal pat on the back. Instead,「Your website is a piece of shit!」was how Bill said hello. Followed by a couple more minutes of ranting on how the Altamont website was not up to snuff. This was Silicon Valley; you couldn’t be a successful startup here and have a shitty website! It was a full minute or two before Jesse could say anything.「Bill’s natural state is to be oppositional and challenge you,」Jesse says.「The great thing about Bill is that he is aggressive and tenacious in giving negative feedback.」*

Bill was candid with the kids, too. Jonathan’s daughter, Hannah, grew up wanting to play big-time college soccer, which in the United States means Division I. Bill watched her play, then told her, sure, she could make a Division I college team and might even start at some programs. Or she could go to a Division III school and be a star while getting a great education. Hannah was deflated, but she knew the coach was right. She subsequently graduated with a degree in engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, helped them win an NCAA Division III championship her senior year, and earned a Scholar All-America award.

Of course, being Bill, sometimes that candor could be presented in fairly raw language. Mason Randall was a star athlete at Sacred Heart and the quarterback of the eighth-grade flag football team, which Bill coached. One day they were playing archrival Menlo. Mason threw a late interception, which helped contribute to a Sacred Heart loss. He was walking off the field, head low, dejected, when Bill came up beside him. He stuck his forefinger in his cheek, popped it out, and said,「Mason! What’s that?」

「It’s the sound of my head coming out of my ass?」the eighth grader asked, repeating an oft-heard Bill phrase.

「That’s right. Get your head up! We lost this one as a team!」

The interesting thing is—and our experience with Bill bears this out—that his candor, no matter how brutal, made you feel better. This seems counterintuitive; after all, having someone tell you how badly you screwed up should feel pretty crummy. But coming from Bill it didn’t; the formula of candor plus caring works well! We trusted that Bill was kicking our butts to help make us better. As Vinod Khosla says,「Lots of people won’t actually state their mind. Bill always stated what he was thinking. But he did it in a way that even if people were disappointed, they were charged up about it! That’s an unusual talent.」

Dave Kinser, Bill’s head of operations at Claris, recalls a time that Bill was going to chew out one of Dave’s fellow executives. Before the「ball busting,」Bill approached Dave, told him about what he was going to do, and asked him if he could talk to the exec afterward. Bill thought the guy would need some moral support. So later that day, Dave tentatively walked into the guy’s office and was surprised to see him excited and pumped up. Bill had indeed delivered the tough message, but the guy felt great about it. Dave went back to Bill’s office and took credit for rebuilding the man’s confidence, when in fact no damage had been done!

DON’T STICK IT IN THEIR EAR

And when he was finished asking questions and listening, and busting your butt, he usually would not tell you what to do. He believed that managers should not walk in with an idea and「stick it in their ear.」Don’t tell people what to do, tell them stories about why they are doing it.

「I used to describe success and prescribe to everyone how we were going to do it,」says Dan Rosensweig.「Bill coached me to tell stories. When people understand the story they can connect to it and figure out what to do. You need to get people to buy in. It’s like a running back in football. You don’t tell him exactly what route to run. You tell him where the hole is and what’s the blocking scheme and let him figure it out.」

Jonathan often experienced this as a sort of test: Bill would tell a story and let Jonathan go off and think about it until their next session to see if Jonathan could process and understand the lesson it contained and its implications. Chad Hurley, YouTube cofounder, had the same experience.「It was like sitting with a friend at the Old Pro [the Palo Alto sports bar],」Chad says.「He would talk about things that had happened to him. He wasn’t trying to preach, just be present.」

Fortunately, Bill expected similar candor in return. Alan Gleicher, who worked with Bill as the head of sales and operations at Intuit, had a simple way of summing up how to be successful with him.「Don’t dance. If Bill asks a question and you don’t know the answer, don’t dance around it. Tell him you don’t know!」For Bill, honesty and integrity weren’t just about keeping your word and telling the truth; they were also about being forthright. This is critical for effective coaching; a good coach doesn’t hide the stuff that’s hard to talk about—in fact, a good coach will draw this out. He or she gets at the hard stuff.

Scholars would describe Bill’s approach—listening, providing honest feedback, demanding candor—as「relational transparency,」which is a core characteristic of「authentic leadership.」13 Wharton professor Adam Grant has another term for it:「disagreeable givers.」He notes in an email to us that「we often feel torn between supporting and challenging others. Social scientists reach the same conclusion for leadership as they do for parenting: it’s a false dichotomy. You want to be supportive and demanding, holding high standards and expectations but giving the encouragement necessary to reach them. Basically, it’s tough love. Disagreeable givers are gruff and tough on the surface, but underneath they have others’ best interests at heart. They give the critical feedback no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear.」

Research on organizations shows what Bill seemed to know instinctively: that these leadership traits lead to better team performance. One study of a chain of retail stores found that when employees saw their managers as authentic (for example, agreeing that the manager「says exactly what he or she means」), the employees trusted the leaders more, and the stores had higher sales.14

BE THE EVANGELIST FOR COURAGE

In 2014, Twitter was negotiating a partnership deal with Google that would allow Google to include tweets in its search results. Dick Costolo, Twitter’s CEO at the time, was working with his team on the deal. There were a lot of concerns about the terms, so the team was advocating a smaller deal to test things out first. Dick updated Bill on the progress at his next coaching 1:1.

「This is onesy, twosy stuff,」Bill told him. Dick shouldn’t nibble around the edges; he should push for the boldest solution possible. If he was going to do something big, there was no way to anticipate all the smaller details and problems, so maybe sign a shorter-term deal. But the main point was to go big.「There’s a big idea here! Come up with a more courageous path forward.」Dick got the team to be more aggressive, and a few months later they announced a deal to give Google access to Twitter’s data stream.

Bill’s perspective was that it’s a manager’s job to push the team to be more courageous. Courage is hard. People are naturally afraid of taking risks for fear of failure. It’s the manager’s job to push them past their reticence. Shona Brown, a longtime Google executive, calls it being an「evangelist for courage.」As a coach, Bill was a never-ending evangelist for courage. As Bill Gurley notes, he「blew confidence into people.」He believed you could do things, even when you yourself weren’t so sure, always pushing you to go beyond your self-imposed limits. Danny Shader, founder and CEO of PayNearMe, who worked with Bill at GO:「The thing I got the most out of meetings with Bill is courage. I always came away thinking, I can do this. He believed you could do stuff that you didn’t believe you could do.」

Emil Michael says,「He would always convey boldness to me. It would always give me such a boost. That’s one thing I learned from Bill: be the person who gives energy, not one who takes it away.」This quality of constant encouragement, of being the person to give energy, has been shown to be one of the most important aspects of effective coaching.*15

Shishir Mehrotra started his first company, Centrata, in 2001. Not long afterward, he got a call from one of his investors. The company was struggling and needed to cut expenses. The investor had gone through the résumés of everyone in the company and chosen the people he felt should be laid off. They were mostly the more junior people in the company; the investor thought the company needed to retain its more experienced people. The problem was, most of the people the investor had selected were Shishir’s cofounders. Shishir didn’t think letting them go was a smart move, but when pressed by the investor, he did it. Then he called Bill.

Bill was furious. Where was Shishir’s courage?「His constant advice to me, even back then, was to trust my instincts,」Shishir says.「I was twenty-two years old!」Bill asked Shishir, did he think laying off all the junior staff was the right thing to do? Shishir’s answer was no, these people are the cofounders, they care more. The more senior people are more like mercenaries. They’ll leave as soon as things go south. Bill coached Shishir to have the courage to follow his instincts, so he turned around and rehired the people he had just laid off. They formed the core of the company for the next several years.

Conveying boldness was not blind cheerleading on Bill’s part. He had the mind-set that most people have value, and he had the experience and a good enough eye for talent that he generally knew what he was talking about. He had such credibility that if he said that you could do something, you believed him, not because he was a cheerleader but because he was a coach and experienced executive. He built his message on your capabilities and progress. This is a key aspect of delivering encouragement as a coach: it needs to be credible.*16

And if you believed him, you started to believe in yourself, which of course helped you achieve whatever daunting task lay before you.「He gave me permission to go forth,」Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat says.「To have confidence in my judgment.」

This confidence is even more important when things are rough. Millard「Mickey」Drexler, the former CEO of J.Crew and Gap, who sat on the Apple board for sixteen years alongside Bill, is a firm believer in the CEO as coach model, particularly in challenging times. When things are bad,「people come into work every day getting beat up. Everyone feels awful. As a leader, you can’t fix problems on your own, and you can’t fix them when morale is down. So you need to build the confidence of the team.」

Bill set high standards for his coachees; he believed they could be great, greater than what they believed. This created an aspiration for each of us, and disappointment when we thought that we were not living up to that aspiration. Bill set the bar higher for us than we set it for ourselves, and when you approach people with that mind-set, they respond.

FULL IDENTITY FRONT AND CENTER

David Drummond is Alphabet’s head of corporate development and legal affairs, and is an African American.「When you come from a background that is not traditional—if you’re black—you don’t typically fit in,」David says.「There is a strong pressure to conform and not show that part of yourself. In Silicon Valley, you are supposed to be either technical or from a fancy business school.」Bill Campbell was neither, but he still, as David puts it,「put his full identity front and center.」

Bill and David talked about this, with Bill counseling David that so much about him was where he came from, and that he should hang on to that as a source of motivation and strength.「He made me less self-conscious about the fact that I wasn’t the same as everyone. That I was black.」

One thing we learned from interviewing people for this book was how much Bill encouraged people to be themselves at work, well before the「bringing your whole self」meme became so popular. This isn’t something we ever heard directly from him; white heterosexual males who attended top schools (that is, us) don’t typically have issues with being themselves at their workplace. But as a guy from a working-class town, a former football coach with a nontechnical degree who parachuted into Silicon Valley in the early 1980s, Bill had some experience with feeling out of place. Yet he was always fully himself, and he expected no less than that from the people he coached. He felt that when people could be so authentic as to bring their full selves to work, they would be more respected by their colleagues, and would appreciate it more when others did the same.

Brad Smith (former Intuit CEO) and Shellye Archambeau (former CEO of MetricStream) received similar advice from Bill. Brad is from West Virginia and sports a strong accent; early in his career he was advised to get speech training to lose it. He decided not to.「I realized my accent isn’t a bug, it’s a feature,」Brad now says (perfectly mixing Silicon Valley parlance with West Virginia drawl).「People prefer leaders who are different because it makes leadership seem more attainable.」Shellye is an African American, and early in her career, when she was in sales at IBM, she tried to shed her cultural background and dress and act like everyone else. Bill helped her past that.「He encouraged me to dress however I felt most comfortable, because people can tell when you’re not being yourself,」she says.「Then they try to figure out why not, and that breeds distrust.」

FULL IDENTITY FRONT AND CENTER

PEOPLE ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY CAN BE COMPLETELY THEMSELVES AND BRING THEIR FULL IDENTITY TO WORK.

* * *

These are the elements that formed the foundation of Bill’s success as an executive coach—and that those who benefited from his coaching took with them when they became coaches to their own colleagues and direct reports, too. He started by building trust, which only deepened over time. He was highly selective in choosing his coachees; he would only coach the coachable, the humble, hungry lifelong learners. He listened intently, without distraction. He usually didn’t tell you what to do; rather, he shared stories and let you draw conclusions. He gave, and demanded, complete candor. And he was an evangelist for courage, by showing inordinate confidence and setting aspirations high.

All of these created a remarkable environment when you were in the room with him: it was an atmosphere dedicated to making you better. As former CEO of eBay John Donahoe says,「It wasn’t so much about the advice and insight he gave me. With Bill you close your eyes and it’s more about who he was. I felt it more than I heard it.」

# Chapter 4 Team First

When Google went public, in August 2004, it created two classes of stock. Class A shares were the ones sold to the public, each share coming with traditional voting rights: one share equals one vote. But class B shares were different: each share came with ten votes. Class B shares were not sold publicly and were held by Google insiders, such as cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and CEO Eric. This「dual class」structure ensured that Google’s founders and executive team retained control of the company. This structure was unusual at the time and highly controversial, stirring public debate in the months leading up to the IPO.*

To Larry and Sergey, the structure was a critical element of their vision for the company. They admired Warren Buffett and had become knowledgeable about the dual class stock structure that his company Berkshire Hathaway employed. They had always considered Google as much an institution as a business. They fervently believed in thinking long term, making big bets and big investments in those bets, without having to consider the quarterly ups and downs of public markets. They were concerned that Google would lose this「think big」propensity once it was a public company, and they saw the dual class stock structure as a way to guard against that happening. Their interests would always be aligned with that of shareholders, they reasoned, because long-term thinking and investing was the best way to maximize value for everyone.

Eric found himself at the center of this debate. After many hours talking with the founders, he became convinced that theirs was the best approach. He believed it would keep Google on track not just in its current businesses but in its broader mission of organizing the world’s information, and it would actually lead to the creation of greater shareholder value than the traditional structure. He made this case to the board, but there was still a lot of open discussion.

At the same time, some board members had been mulling over the idea of bringing in a new chairman of the board, someone who was more independent of the company, and the discussion on the dual stock classes pushed them even further in that direction. They asked Eric if he would step aside as chairman. He would remain as CEO.

Eric was hurt by this stance. He felt he had done a good job in his three years as chairman and CEO, and, as far as he knew, the board agreed. He had earned the trust of the founders and employees, the company had performed very well, and they were about to go public. And for that they wanted to remove him as chairman? He got on a call with Bill and gave his perspective on the situation.

「What are you going to do?」Bill asked.

In a moment full of pride and hurt, Eric said,「I’m going to quit Google.」

「Okay,」Bill said.「When?」

At that moment, as the coach of Google’s executive team, Bill became a critical player in the future of the company. The greatest team in technology was about to break up. Bill couldn’t let it happen. The meeting with the board where all this would be decided—where Eric was going to step down not just as chairman, but maybe as CEO, too—was on Thursday, a couple of days hence. Bill got to work.

Bill Campbell was a coach of teams. He built them, shaped them, put the right players in the right positions (and removed the wrong players from the wrong positions), cheered them on, and kicked them in their collective butt when they were underperforming. He knew, as he often said, that「you can’t get anything done without a team.」This is an obvious point in the realm of sports, but it’s often underappreciated in business.「You can only really succeed and accomplish things through the collective, the common purpose,」Lee C. Bollinger says.「There are so many ways in which people don’t understand this, and even when they do understand it, they don’t know how to do it. That’s where Bill’s genius was.」

Bill’s guiding principle was that the team is paramount, and the most important thing he looked for and expected in people was a「team-first」attitude. Teams are not successful unless every member is loyal and will, when necessary, subjugate their personal agenda to that of the team. That the team wins has to be the most important thing. Perhaps Charles Darwin said it best in his book The Descent of Man:「A tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection.」1

Back in 2004, Bill correctly assessed that feelings were rubbed raw over the pending IPO, the discussions on how to structure the company, and the idea that Eric step down as chairman. He understood that Eric was hurt, but he also knew that the team needed him to stay. He also felt that Eric was the best person to be the company’s chairman, at that point and for the foreseeable future. So he thought about the situation and called Eric back the next day. You can’t leave, the team needs you, he stated. How about if you step down as chairman for now, and remain as CEO? And then at some point, not too far from now, Bill would see to it that Eric got reinstated as chairman.

He’d offered a reasonable compromise and appealed to Eric’s loyalty to Google. This was not a fight to have today, he told Eric. Your pride is getting in the way of what’s best for the company, and for you.

Eric saw that Bill was right, and he had no doubt that Bill could implement what he was proposing, so Eric agreed. Together they talked through how the board meeting the next day would go, and by the time Thursday rolled around, Eric was well prepared. He stepped down as chairman and stayed on as CEO. Later, in 2007, he was reinstated as chairman, a role he held until April 2011. He was executive chairman from that date until January 2018.

Many people might look at Eric’s short-lived decision to leave Google as completely crazy. Look how much stock he would be leaving behind! But in teams, and particularly high-performing teams, other things matter, too. It’s not just about money! Purpose, pride, ambition, ego: these are vital motivators as well and must be considered by any manager or coach. Bill knew that he had to appeal to Eric both emotionally and rationally. His suggested compromise worked.

At the time he proposed the compromise, Bill did not have everyone’s agreement that Eric would be reinstated as chairman down the road. He simply knew that it was the right thing to do for the company, and that, as the coach, he had the influence to make things like that happen. Bill’s integrity and his long record of sound judgment were paramount. When the time was right, when the IPO was done and emotions had simmered down, Bill would make the case to reinstate Eric as chairman. Which is exactly what happened.

This was an example of high-stakes team building, with a multibillion-dollar IPO at stake and investors, founders, and executives debating difficult issues. But it is in precisely these situations that a team coach is needed the most, someone who can see past individual egos and understand the value that all of the members, combined, create. Team building is vital at every company, and the principles Bill espoused apply at every level of an organization. But it gets a lot harder to hold a team together at senior levels in companies, where egos and ambitions are considerable.

Senior executives may have access to individual executive coaching, but team coaches at that level are more rare. After all, all-star teams may have coaches, but they aren’t really coaching—they usually just sit back and enjoy the show! So why should executive teams, which consist of presumably the most talented people in the company, need a coach?「It was bizarre to me when I first joined the company,」Patrick Pichette says.「You have all these amazing people at Google. Why would they need a coach?」

In fact, it’s nearly impossible to overstate Bill’s influence in nurturing the Google management team during the company’s formative years, an influence that continued until he passed away. As Omid Kordestani, former Google head of sales, puts it:「What was very special about Google was the community aspect of the senior team. Bill was the glue in that process.」

So as a coach of teams, what would Bill do? His first instinct was always to work the team, not the problem. In other words, he focused on the team’s dynamics, not on trying to solve the team’s particular challenges. That was their job. His job was team building, assessing people’s talents, and finding the doers. He ran toward the biggest problems, the stinkers that fester and cause tension. He focused on winning but winning right, and he doubled down on his core values when things turned south. And he brought resolution by filling the gaps between people, listening, observing, and then seeking people out in behind-the-scenes conversations that brought teams together.

「You always had the sense he was building a team,」says Sheryl Sandberg.「With Bill, it wasn’t executive coaching or career coaching. It was never just about me. It was always about the team.」

WORK THE TEAM, THEN THE PROBLEM

At a Google meeting a few years ago, the group was discussing an issue related to costs in some of the developing businesses. Ram Shriram raised concerns: the numbers were getting big! Shouldn’t we get more details on how we are working on this? There was some back-and-forth, then Bill spoke up. Don’t worry, he said, we have the right team in place. They are working the problem.

「I learned something from that,」Ram says.「Bill didn’t work the problem first, he worked the team. We didn’t talk about the problem analytically. We talked about the people on the team and if they could get it done.」

As managers, we tend to focus on the problem at hand. What is the situation? What are the issues? What are the options? And so on. These are valid questions, but the coach’s instinct is to lead with a more fundamental one. Who was working on the problem? Was the right team in place? Did they have what they needed to succeed?「When I became CEO of Google,」Sundar Pichai says,「Bill advised me that at that level, more than ever before, you need to bet on people. Choose your team. Think much harder about that.」

Bill helped us employ this approach in a problem that arose in 2010. Apple (and in particular, Steve Jobs) believed that Google’s Android operating system violated patents that Apple had developed for the iPhone. They sued Google’s business partners, the manufacturers of Android phones. This wasn’t just a business or a legal problem to Bill—it was personal. He was close friends with Jobs and a member of Apple’s board—as well as an informal but influential coach to Google’s leadership team. It was like his two children were fighting, with much more at stake than a favorite toy.

Bill’s approach was to focus on the team, not the problem. He never even offered an opinion on the relative merits of each side’s case, even though he was quite knowledgeable about the issues and the phone features in question. He did, however, counsel Eric to put the right guy in charge of talking to Apple: Alan Eustace. Alan became the chief diplomat interfacing with Apple. It became his job to ensure that the relationship between the companies didn’t implode.

Much later in Bill’s career, Google was planning an important change to its corporate structure. The company was forming a new holding company, to be called Alphabet, and moving some of its most speculative efforts (called「other bets」) out into separate companies. This new organization was a major shift in the operating structure and management culture; Sundar Pichai was being promoted to run Google, with Larry Page moving over to become CEO of Alphabet. Meanwhile, the company’s head of sales, Nikesh Arora, had left, creating a big hole in one of the key leadership positions. The company contacted Omid Kordestani, its first head of sales. Would he be interested in coming back?

「It was clear at that point that we would be moving to Alphabet, and that Sundar would be CEO of Google,」Omid says,「but it wasn’t clear how we would get there. There were so many complex steps involved.」When he talked to Bill, they didn’t talk about the operational changes or any of the tactics or strategy involved. They talked about the team. Bill wanted someone who cared about the company and its people to help with the transition, which described Omid perfectly.「Care for the team like that is unusual at that level,」Omid says.「It tends to be pretty cutthroat. But not for Bill. The management team was his primary love.」

WORK THE TEAM, THEN THE PROBLEM

WHEN FACED WITH A PROBLEM OR OPPORTUNITY, THE FIRST STEP IS TO ENSURE THE RIGHT TEAM IS IN PLACE AND WORKING ON IT.

* * *

PICK THE RIGHT PLAYERS

「If you’re running a company, you have to surround yourself with really, really good people,」Bill said. Not one of his most surprising statements: it is a tired business mantra to always hire people smarter than yourself.「Everybody that is managing a function on behalf of the CEO ought to be better at that function than the CEO. Some of the time, they are going to be wearing their HR hat or their IT hat, but most of the time you want them to be wearing their company hat. These are all smart people that have great capabilities, and what you want to get is the best idea that comes from that group.」

Bill looked for four characteristics in people. The person has to be smart, not necessarily academically but more from the standpoint of being able to get up to speed quickly in different areas and then make connections. Bill called this the ability to make「far analogies.」The person has to work hard, and has to have high integrity. Finally, the person should have that hard-to-define characteristic: grit. The ability to get knocked down and have the passion and perseverance to get up and go at it again.

He would tolerate a lot of other faults if he thought a person had those four characteristics. When he interviewed job candidates to assess these points, he wouldn’t just ask about what a person did, he would ask how they did it. If the person said they「led a project that led to revenue growth,」asking how they achieved that growth will tell you a lot about how they were involved in the project. Were they hands-on? Were they doers? Did they build the team? He would listen for the pronouns: does the person say「I」(could signify a me-first mentality) or「we」(a potential indicator of a team player)?*2

A big turnoff for Bill was if they were no longer learning. Do they have more answers than questions? That’s a bad sign!

He looked for commitment, to the cause and not just to their own success. Team first! You need to find, as Sundar Pichai says,「people who understand that their success depends on working well together, that there’s give-and-take—people who put the company first.」Whenever Sundar and Bill found people like that, Sundar says,「we would cherish them.」

But how do you know when you have found such a person? Keep note of the times when they give up things, and when they are excited for someone else’s success. Sundar notes that「sometimes decisions come up and people have to give up things. I overindex on those signals when people give something up.* And also when someone is excited because something else is working well in the company. It isn’t related to them, but they are excited. I watch for that. Like when you see a player on the bench cheering for someone else on the team, like Steph Curry jumping up and down when Kevin Durant hits a big shot. You can’t fake that.」*

In 2011, Eric stepped down as Google CEO. In the ensuing reorganization, Jonathan’s job as head of products was eliminated. He was considering a few options, including running the Enterprise business (now Google Cloud, a multibillion-dollar division), but decided to decline them all. He felt hurt by the reorg and considered these other jobs a demotion. Bill was so disappointed; Jonathan was putting his bruised ego ahead of what was best for the Google team (and, in fact, himself). He was making a「mistake born of ego and emotion,」and Bill thought Jonathan maybe should consider removing his head from his ass.

Bill suggested that Jonathan take more time to consider his decision, and he continued to meet with him on a regular basis. With Bill’s help, Jonathan later found his way back into the Google fold by taking on other roles. Bill didn’t give up on him, but he also never let him forget how he had let the team down. This was a vivid and personal lesson: when change happens, the priority has to be what is best for the team.

Bill valued courage: the willingness to take risks and the willingness to stand up for what’s right for the team, which may entail taking a personal risk. Earlier in his Google career, before he became CEO, Sundar Pichai would often speak up when he felt something wasn’t the right choice, both to us and later to Larry Page when he was CEO. That takes some guts, but as Sundar says,「Bill always appreciated it when I spoke my mind about difficult issues because he knew I cared about the company and the products, and that’s where I was coming from.」

Sundar respects the same in others when he sees it today.「There are people who are team players and really care about the company. When they speak up, it matters a lot to me because I know they are coming from the right place.」

Bill was attracted to people who were「difficult」—more outspoken in their opinions, occasionally abrasive, not afraid to buck trends or the crowd.「Like diamonds that are somehow misshapen,」is how Alan Eustace puts it. Bill’s friendship with Steve Jobs was a testament to this, as was his long partnership with other founders: Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, Scott Cook of Intuit. Not an easygoing person among them! We don’t think Bill sought this out as a personality trait, but he tolerated it and even embraced it. Whereas others might find this type of person difficult, Bill found these people interesting and worth developing, sometimes helping them smooth away rough edges. The most effective coaches tolerate and even encourage some level of eccentricity and「prickliness」among their team members. Outstanding performers, from athletes to founders to business executives, are often「difficult.」You want them on your team.

Sheryl Sandberg says that the first time she met Bill, during her first week at Google in late 2001, he asked her, what do you do here? At the time, Sheryl had been hired with the title of「business unit general manager,」a position that didn’t exist before she arrived. There were, in fact, no business units, so she had nothing to manage. She answered by saying that she used to be at the Treasury Department. He stopped her: okay, but what do you do here? This time, she replied with ideas of what she thought she might do. Bill wasn’t satisfied: but what do you do here? Sheryl finally copped to the truth: so far, she didn’t do anything.「I learned an incredibly important lesson,」she says.「It’s not what you used to do, it’s not what you think, it’s what you do every day.」This is perhaps the most important characteristic Bill looked for in his players: people who show up, work hard, and have an impact every day. Doers.

As you evaluate people, it’s important to consider how they fit in the team and the company. People, especially in Silicon Valley, tend to look for「superheroes,」people with superior smarts and savvy who can do it all and be the best at everything. This is magnified at companies’ senior levels. As Philipp Schindler says,「Bill made the point that you don’t want to staff a team with just quarterbacks; you need to pay a lot of attention to the team composition and have a diverse set of different talents smartly woven together.」All people have their limitations; what’s important is to understand them individually, to identify what makes them different, and then to see how you can help them mesh with the rest of the team. Bill appreciated high cognitive abilities, but he also understood the value of soft skills, like empathy, that aren’t always valued in businesses, especially tech ones. At Google, he helped us learn to appreciate that this combination—smarts and hearts—creates better managers.

He did not overemphasize experience. He looked at skills and mind-set, and he could project what you could become. This is a coach’s talent, the ability to see a player’s potential, not just current performance. Maybe not completely accurately: as Stanford professor Carol Dweck points out in her 2006 book, Mindset, someone’s true potential is unknowable, since「it’s impossible to foresee what can be accomplished with years of passion, toil, and training.」3 But even without that accuracy, you can bet on potential enough to avoid writing off people solely because they lack experience. The general tendency is to hire for experience: I’m hiring for job X, so I want someone who has years of experience doing job X. If you are creating a high-performing team and building for the future, you need to hire for potential as well as experience.

Picking the right players can also entail reconsidering who else within the company should be on the team. When Jonathan ran the product team at Google, his staff included several product management leaders. But because of how the company was organized, it did not include engineering leaders. This led to some conflict when it came time to allocate and assign people and resources; the product leads didn’t always agree with the engineering leads. Jonathan’s staff meetings often involved a lot of argument about these decisions, and some complaining about the absent engineering leads.

Bill’s counsel to Jonathan was simple: add some players to the team. Jonathan should invite the engineering leads to his staff meeting. Not to just one meeting, but permanently. Then force the discussion of plans with them, air the arguments, and get everyone to buy in on whatever decisions were made. The purpose of the meetings was not for Jonathan to demonstrate command of topics discussed and tell people what to do (which, as Bill observed, was sometimes Jonathan’s practice); it was to get the team to gel. Bringing in the people who were a focal point of dissension was the only way to do that. Sure, there were still plenty of arguments, but because more of the players were in the room, they got resolved more quickly, which helped create stronger relationships across groups.

Bill started to show a knack for picking players early in his business career. Eric Johnson was a colleague of Bill’s at Kodak. Eric says that at the time Kodak was very profitable, so it wasn’t too concerned with getting rid of mediocre performers. Bill wasn’t one to make heads roll, either—he got better at dealing with poor performers later on, when he had to as CEO of Intuit. However, at Kodak he developed a talent for finding the「doers」in any department and getting those people talking. This isn’t always easy in a large company, but Bill would look for those same characteristics he looked for in candidates: smarts, hard work, integrity, grit. And then he would figure out ways to formally or informally bring those people together to talk and make stuff happen, around a particular project or problem.

「People would look forward to the meeting with Bill,」Eric recounts,「because when Campbell ran a meeting or brought a group together, the environment was results oriented, everyone participated and contributed, and they actually enjoyed the meeting. It was positive and fun to be part of a team.」

PICK THE RIGHT PLAYERS

THE TOP CHARACTERISTICS TO LOOK FOR ARE SMARTS AND HEARTS: THE ABILITY TO LEARN FAST, A WILLINGNESS TO WORK HARD, INTEGRITY, GRIT, EMPATHY, AND A TEAM-FIRST ATTITUDE.

* * *

PAIR PEOPLE

As we noted earlier, Bill highly valued peer relationships. An important, often overlooked, aspect of team building is developing relationships within the team. This can happen organically, but it is important enough that it should not be left to chance. So Bill looked for any opportunity to pair people up. Take a couple of people who don’t usually work together, assign them a task, project, or decision, and let them work on it on their own. This develops trust between the two people, usually regardless of the nature of the work.*4

This was one of Bill’s first suggestions to Jonathan. After sitting in on a couple of his staff meetings, Bill told Jonathan that he needed to work more on coaching people and pairing them up on things. Don’t just be a dictator assigning tasks, pair people up! So from that point forward, for projects such as preparing material for public events like earnings calls, producing team off-sites, working on compensation and promotion ladders, and developing internal tools, Jonathan stopped dictating and started pairing people up. The results: better decisions, stronger team.

Bill would coach Jonathan to do this himself. When Patrick Pichette joined Google as CFO, Bill asked Jonathan to seek him out and mentor him on the ways of the company. This was helpful to Patrick, but it also helped create a new trusted pair relationship on Eric’s management team, which was the actual objective. The deliverable matters, but what matters just as much is the opportunity for the pair of teammates to work together on something and get to know and trust each other. That is invaluable to the team’s success.

PEER RELATIONSHIPS ARE CRITICAL AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED, SO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO PAIR PEOPLE UP ON PROJECTS OR DECISIONS.

THE PEER FEEDBACK SURVEY

Bill felt so strongly about the importance of peer relationships that he helped design a peer feedback survey we used for years at Google. Respondents gave feedback about colleagues, and the results provided a good picture of how well a person was performing in the eyes of their peers, the most important evaluators, in Bill’s opinion.

The survey was initially designed to elicit opinions on four aspects of a person’s performance: job performance, relationship with peer groups, management and leadership, and innovation. Later Bill insisted that it be expanded to include a question about people’s behavior in meetings. He was dismayed by how many people chose to be on their phones or laptops in meetings! We added a question about collaboration as well, and a set of questions on product vision that went just to product leaders. Here is the complete survey:

CORE ATTRIBUTES

For the past 12 months, to what extent do you agree/disagree that each person:

Displayed extraordinary in-role performance.

Exemplified world-class leadership.

Achieved outcomes that were in the best interest of both Google as a whole and his/her organization.

Expanded the boundaries of what is possible for Google through innovation and/or application of best practices.
