Metaphors based on simple physical concepts—up-down, in-out, object, substance, etc.—which are as basic as anything in our conceptual system and without which we could not function in the world —could not reason or communicate—are not in themselves very rich. To say that something is viewed as a  CONTAINER OBJECT  with an  IN-OUT  orientation does not say very much about it. But, as we saw with the  MIND IS A MACHINE  metaphor and the various personification metaphors, we can elaborate spatialization metaphors in much more specific terms. This allows us not only to elaborate a concept (like the  MIND ) in considerable detail but also to find appropriate means for highlighting some aspects of it and hiding others. Structural metaphors (such as  RATIONAL ARGUMENT IS WAR ) provide the richest source of such elaboration. Structural metaphors allow us to do much more than just orient concepts, refer to them, quantify them, etc., as we do with simple orientational and ontological metaphors; they allow us, in addition, to use one highly structured and clearly delineated concept to structure another.

Like orientational and ontological metaphors, structural metaphors are grounded in systematic correlations within our experience. To see what this means in detail, let us examine how the  RATIONAL ARGUMENT IS WAR  metaphor might be grounded. This metaphor allows us to conceptualize what a rational argument is in terms of something that we understand more readily, namely, physical conflict. Fighting is found everywhere in the animal kingdom and nowhere so much as among human animals. Animals fight to get what they want—food, sex, territory, control, etc.— because there are other animals who want the same thing or who want to stop them from getting it. The same is true of human animals, except that we have developed more sophisticated techniques for getting our way. Being "rational animals," we have institutionalized our fighting in a number of ways, one of them being war. Even though we have over the ages institutionalized physical conflict and have employed many of our finest minds to develop more effective means of carrying it out, its basic structure remains essentially unchanged. In fights between two brute animals, scientists have observed the practices of issuing challenges for the sake of intimidation, of establishing and defending territory, attacking, defending, counterattacking, retreating, and surrendering. Human fighting involves the same practices.

Part of being a rational animal, however, involves getting what you want without subjecting yourself to the dangers of actual physical conflict. As a result, we humans have evolved the social institution of verbal argument. We have arguments all the time in order to try to get what we want, and sometimes these "degenerate" into physical violence. Such verbal battles are comprehended in much the same terms as physical battles. Take a domestic quarrel, for instance. Husband and wife are both trying to get what each of them wants, such as getting the other to accept a certain viewpoint on some issue or at least to act according to that viewpoint. Each sees himself as having something to win and something to lose, territory to establish and territory to defend. In a no-holds-barred argument, you attack, defend, counterattack, etc., using whatever verbal means you have at your disposal—intimidation, threat, invoking authority, insult, belittling, challenging authority, evading issues, bargaining, flattering, and even trying to give "rational reasons." But all of these tactics can be, and often are, presented as  reasons;  for example:



... because I'm bigger than you.  (intimidation)

... because if you don't, I'll...  (threat)

... because I'm the boss,  (authority)

... because you're stupid,  (insult)

... because you usually do it wrong,  (belittling)

... because I have as much right as you do.  (challenging authority)

... because I love you.  (evading the issue)  ...

... because if you will..., I'll...  (bargaining)

... because you're so much better at it.  (flattery)



Arguments that use tactics like these are the most common in our culture, and because they are so much a part of our daily lives, we sometimes don't notice them. However, there are important and powerful segments of our culture where such tactics are, at least in principle, frowned upon because they are considered to be "irrational" and "unfair." The academic world, the legal world, the diplomatic world, the ecclesiastical world, and the world of journalism claim to present an ideal, or "higher," form of  RATIONAL ARGUMENT , in which all of these tactics are forbidden. The only permissible tactics in this  RATIONAL ARGUMENT  are supposedly the stating of premises, the citing of supporting evidence, and the drawing of logical conclusions. But even in the most ideal cases, where all of these conditions hold,  RATIONAL ARGUMENT   is still comprehended and carried out in terms of   WAR . There is still a position to be established and defended, you can win or lose, you have an opponent whose position you attack and try to destroy and whose argument you try to shoot down. If you are completely successful, you can wipe him out.

The point here is that not only our conception of an argument but the way we carry it out is grounded in our knowledge and experience of physical combat. Even if you have never fought a fistfight in you life, much less a war, but have been arguing from the time you began to talk, you still conceive of arguments, and execute them, according to the  ARGUMENT S WAR  metaphor because the metaphor is built into the conceptual system of the culture in which you live. Not only are all the "rational" arguments that are assumed to actually live up to the ideal of  RATIONAL ARGUMENT  conceived of in terms of war, but almost all of them contain, in hidden form, the "irrational" and "unfair" tactics that rational arguments in their ideal form are supposed to transcend. Here are some typical examples:



It is plausible to assume that...  (intimidation)

Clearly,...

Obviously,...

It would be unscientific to fail to...  (threat)

To say that would be to commit the Fallacy of...

As Descartes showed,...  (authority)

Hume observed that...

Footnote 374: cf. Verschlugenheimer, 1954.

The work lacks the necessary rigor for...  (insult)

Let us call such a theory "Narrow" Rationalism.

In a display of "scholarly objectivity," ...

The work will not lead to a formalized theory,  (belittling)

His results cannot be quantified.

Few people today seriously hold that view.

Lest we succumb to the error of positivist approaches,...



(challenging authority)



Behaviorism has led to...

He does not present any alternative theory,  (evading the issue)

But that is a matter of...

The author does present some challenging facts, although...

Your position is right as far as it goes,...  (bargaining)

If one takes a realist point of view, one can accept the claim that...

In his stimulating paper,...  (flattery)

His paper raises some interesting issues...



Examples like these allow us to trace the lineage of our rational argument back through "irrational" argument (=  everyday arguing)  to its origins in physical combat. The tactics of intimidation, threat, appeal to authority, etc., though couched, perhaps, in more refined phrases, are just as present in rational argument as they are in everyday arguing and in war. Whether we are in a scientific, academic, or legal setting, aspiring to the ideal of rational argument, or whether we are just trying to get our way in our own household by haggling, the way we conceive of, carry out, and describe our arguments is grounded in the argument is WAR metaphor.

Let us now consider other structural metaphors that are important in our lives: LABOR IS A RESOURCE and  TIME IS A RESOURCE  Both of these metaphors are culturally grounded in our experience with material resources. Material resources are typically raw materials or sources of fuel. Both are viewed as serving purposeful ends. Fuel may be used for heating, transportation, or the energy used in producing a finished product. Raw materials typically go directly into products. In both cases, the material resources can be  quantified  and given a  value.  In both cases, it is the  kind  of material as opposed to the particular piece or quantity of it that is important for achieving the purpose. For example, it doesn't matter which particular pieces of coal heat your house as long as they are the right  kind  of coal. In both cases, the material gets  used up  progressively as the purpose is served. To summarize:



A material resource is a  kind  of substance

can be  quantified  fairly precisely

can be assigned a  value  per unit quantity

serves a  purposeful  end

is  used up  progressively as it serves its purpose



Take the simple case where you make a product from raw material. It takes a certain amount of labor. In general, the more labor you perform, the more you produce. Assuming that this is true—that the labor is proportional to the amount of product—we can assign  value  to the labor in terms of the time it takes to produce a unit of product. The perfect model of this is the assembly line, where the raw material comes in at one end, labor is performed in progressive stages, whose duration is fixed by the speed of the line itself, and products come out at the other end. This provides a grounding for the  LABOR IS RESOURCE  metaphor, as follows:



LABOR  is a  kind  of activity (recall:  AN ACTIVITY IS A SUBSTANCE )

can be  quantified  fairly precisely (in terms of time)

can be assigned a  value  per unit

serves a  purposeful  end

is  used up  progressively as it serves it purpose



Since labor can be quantified in terms of time and usually is, in an industrial society, we get the basis for the time is a  RESOURCE   metaphor:



TIME  is a  kind  of (abstract) substance

can be  quantified  fairly precisely

can be assigned a  value  per unit

serves a  purposeful  end

is  used up  progressively as it serves its purpose



When we are living by the metaphors  LABOR IS A RESOURCE  and  TIME  I S

A RESOURCE , as we do in our culture, we tend not to see them as metaphors at all. But, as the above account of their grounding in experience shows, both are structural metaphors that are basic to Western industrial societies.

These two complex structural metaphors both employ simple ontological metaphors, labor is a resource uses AN ACTIVITY IS A SUBSTANCE. TIME IS A RESOURCE uses  TIME IS A SUBSTANCE . These two  SUBSTANCE   metaphors permit labor and time to be quantified—that is, measured, conceived of as being progressively "used up," and assigned monetary values; they also allow us to view time and labor as things that can be "used" for various ends.

LABOR IS A RESOURCE  and TIME I S  A RESOURCE are by no means universal. They emerged naturally in our culture because of the way we view work, our passion for quantification, and our obsession with purposeful ends. These metaphors highlight those aspects of labor and time that are centrally important in our culture. In doing this, they also deemphasize or hide certain aspects of labor and time. We can see what both metaphors hide by examining what they focus on.



In viewing labor as a  kind  of activity, the metaphor assumes that labor can be clearly identified and distinguished from things that are not labor. It makes the assumptions that we can tell work from play and productive activity from nonproductive activity. These assumptions obviously fail to fit reality much of the time, except perhaps on assembly lines, chain gangs, etc. The view of labor as merely a  kind  of activity, independent of who performs it, how he experiences it, and what it means in his life, hides the issues of whether the work is personally meaningful, satisfying, and humane.



The quantification of labor in terms of time, together with the view of time as serving a purposeful end, induces a notion of  LEISURE TIME , which is parallel to the concept  LABOR TIME . In a society like ours, where inactivity is not considered a purposeful end, a whole industry devoted to leisure activity has evolved. As a result,  LEISURE TIME  becomes a  RESOURCE  too—to be spent productively, used wisely, saved up, budgeted, wasted, lost, etc. What is hidden by the  RESOURCE  metaphors for labor and time is the way our concepts of  LABOR  and  TIME  affect our concept of  LEISURE , turning it into something remarkably like  LABOR



The  RESOURCE  metaphors for labor and time hide all sorts of possible conceptions of labor and time that exist in other cultures and in some subcultures of our own society: the idea that work can be play, that inactivity can be productive, that much of what we classify as  LABOR  serves either no clear purpose or no worthwhile purpose.



The three structural metaphors we have considered in this section—RATIONAL  ARGUMENT IS WAR , labor is a resource, and  TIME  I s

A  RESOURCE—all have a strong cultural basis. They emerged naturally in a culture like ours because what they highlight corresponds so closely to what we experience collectively and what they hide corresponds to so little. But not only are they grounded in our physical and cultural experience; they also influence our experience and our actions.

Causation: Partly Emergent and







Partly Metaphorical







We have seen in our discussion of grounding that there are directly emergent concepts (like  UP-DOWN, IN-OUT, OBJECT, SUBSTANCE , etc.) and emergent metaphorical concepts based on our experience (like  THE VISUAL FIELD IS A CONTAINER, AN ACTIVITY IS A CONTAINER , etc.). From the limited range of examples we have considered, it might seem as if there were a clear distinction between directly emergent and metaphorically emergent concepts and that every concept must be one or the other. This is not the case. Even a concept as basic as  CAUSATION  is not purely emergent or purely metaphorical. Rather, it appears to have a directly emergent core that is elaborated metaphorically.





Direct Manipulation: The Prototype of Causation









Standard theories of meaning assume that all of our complex concepts can be analyzed into undecomposable primitives. Such primitives are taken to be the ultimate "building blocks" of meaning. The concept of causation is often taken to be such an ultimate building block. We believe that the standard theories are fundamentally mistaken in assuming that basic concepts are undecomposable primitives.

We agree that causation is a basic human concept. It is one of the concepts most often used by people to organize their physical and cultural realities. But this does not mean that it is an undecomposable primitive. We would like to suggest instead that causation is best understood as an experiential gestalt. A proper understanding of causation requires that it be viewed as a cluster of other components. But the cluster forms a gestalt—a whole that we human beings find more basic than the parts.

We can see this most clearly in infants. Piaget has hypothesized that infants first learn about causation by realizing that they can directly manipulate objects around them—pull off their blankets, throw their bottles, drop toys. There is, in fact, a stage in which infants seem to "practice" these manipulations, e.g., they repeatedly drop their spoons. Such direct manipulations, even on the part of infants, involve certain shared features that characterize the notion of direct causation that is so integral a part of our constant everyday functioning in our environment—as when we flip light switches, button our shirts, open doors, etc. Though each of these actions is different, the overwhelming proportion of them share features of what we may call a "prototypical" or "paradigmatic" case of direct causation. These shared features include:



The agent has as a goal some change of state in the patient.

The change of state is physical.

The agent has a "plan" for carrying out this goal.

The plan requires the agent's use of a motor program.

The agent is in control of that motor program.

The agent is primarily responsible for carrying out the plan.

The agent is the energy source (i.e., the agent is directing his energies toward the patient), and the patient is the energy goal (i.e., the change in the patient is due to an external source of energy).

The agent touches the patient either with his body or an instrument (i.e., there is a spatiotemporal overlap between what the agent does and the change in the patient).

The agent successfully carries out the plan.

The change in the patient is perceptible.

The agent monitors the change in the patient through sensory perception.

There is a single specific agent and a single specific patient.



This set of properties characterizes "prototypical" direct manipulations, and these are cases of causation par excellence. We are using the word "prototypical" in the sense Rosch uses it in her theory of human categorization (1977). Her experiments indicate that people categorize objects, not in set-theoretical terms, but in terms of prototypes and family resemblances. For example, small flying singing birds, like sparrows, robins, etc., are  prototypical birds.  Chickens, ostriches, and penguins are birds but are not central members of the category—they are nonprototypical birds. But they are birds nonetheless, because they bear sufficient family resemblances to the prototype; that is, they share enough of the relevant properties of the prototype to be classified by people as birds.

The twelve properties given above characterize a prototype of causation in the following sense. They recur together over and over in action after action as we go through our daily lives. We experience them as a  gestalt;  that is, the complex of properties occurring together is more basic to our experience than their separate occurrence. Through their constant recurrence in our everyday functioning, the category of causation emerges with this complex of properties characterizing prototypical causations. Other kinds of causation, which are less prototypical, are actions or events that bear sufficient family resemblances to the prototype. These would include action at a distance, nonhuman agency, the use of an intermediate agent, the occurrence of two or more agents, involuntary or uncontrolled use of the motor program, etc. (In physical causation the agent and patient are events, a physical law takes the place of plan, goal, and motor activity, and all of the peculiarly human aspects are factored out.) When there is an insufficient family resemblance to the prototype, we cease to characterize what happens as causation. For example, if there were multiple agents, if what the agents did was remote in space and time from the patient's change, and if there were neither desire nor plan nor control, then we probably wouldn't say that this was an instance of causation, or at least we would have questions about it.

Although the category of causation has fuzzy boundaries, it is clearly delineated in an enormous range of instances. Our successful functioning in the world involves the application of the concept of causation to ever new domains of activity—through intention, planning, drawing inferences, etc. The concept is stable because we continue to function successfully in terms of it. Given a concept of causation that emerges from our experience, we can apply that concept to metaphorical concepts. In "Harry raised our morale by telling jokes," for example, we have an instance of causation where what Harry did made our morale go UP, as in the  HAPPY IS  UP metaphor.

Though the concept of causation as we have characterized it is basic to human activity, it is not a "primitive" in the usual building-block sense, that is, it is not unanalyz-able and undecomposable. Since it is defined in terms of a prototype that is characterized by a recurrent complex of properties, our concept of causation is at once holistic, analyzable into those properties, and capable of a wide range of variation. The terms into which the causation prototype is analyzed (e.g., control, motor program, volition, etc.) are probably also characterized by prototype and capable of further analysis. This permits us to have concepts that are at once basic, holistic, and indefinitely analyzable.





Metaphorical Extensions of Prototypical Causation









Simple instances of making an object (e.g., a paper airplane, a snowball, a sand castle) are all special cases of direct causation. They all involve prototypical direct manipulation, with all of the properties listed above. But they have one additional characteristic that sets them apart as instances of  making:  As a result of the manipulation, we view the object as a different  kind  of thing. What was a sheet of paper is now a paper airplane. We categorize it differently—it has a different form and function. It is essentially this that sets instances of  making  apart from other kinds of direct manipulation. Even a simple change of state, like the change from water to ice, can be viewed as an instance of making, since ice has a different form and function than water. Thus we get examples like:



You can make ice out of water by freezing it.



This parallels examples like:



I made a paper airplane out of a sheet of newspaper.

I made a statue out of clay.



We conceptualize changes of this kind—from one state into another, having a new form and function—in terms of the metaphor  THE OBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE . This is why the expression  out of  is used in the above examples: the ice is viewed as emerging out of the water; the airplane is viewed as emerging out of the paper; the statue is viewed as emerging out of the clay. In a sentence like "I made a statue out of clay," the substance clay is viewed as the  CONTAINER  (via the  SUBSTANCE IS A CONTAINER  metaphor) from which the object—namely, the statue—emerges. Thus the concept  MAKING  is partly, but not totally, metaphorical. That is,  MAKING  is an instance of a directly emergent concept, namely,  DIRECT MANIPULATION , which is further elaborated by the metaphor  THE OBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE.

Another way we can conceptualize making is by elaborating on direct manipulation, using another metaphor:  THE SUBSTANCE GOES INTO THE OBJECT . Thus:



I made a sheet of newspaper  into  an airplane.

I made the clay you gave me  into  a statue.



Here the object is viewed as a container for the material.

The  SUBSTANCE GOES INTO THE OBJECT METAPHOR OCCURS  far more widely than in the concept of  MAKING.  We conceptualize a wide range of changes, natural as well as man-made, in terms of this metaphor. For example:



The water turned  into  ice.

The caterpillar turned  into  a butterfly.

She is slowly changing  into  a beautiful woman.



The  OBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE  metaphor is also used outside the concept of  MAKING  but in a much more limited range of circumstances, mostly those having to do with evolution:



Mammals developed  out of  reptiles.

Our present legal system evolved  out of  English common law.



Thus the two metaphors we use to elaborate direct manipulation into the concept of  MAKING  are both used independently to conceptualize various concepts of  CHANGE .

These two metaphors for  CHANGE , which are used as part of the concept of  MAKING , emerge naturally from as fundamental a human experience as there is, namely, birth. In birth, an object (the baby) comes out of a container (the mother). At the same time, the mother's substance (her flesh and blood) are in the baby (the container object). The experience of birth (and also agricultural growth) provides a grounding for the general concept of  CREATION , which has as its core the concept of  MAKING  a physical object but which extends to abstract entities as well. We can see this grounding in birth metaphors for creation in general:



Our nation was  born out of  a desire for freedom.

His writings are products of his  fertile  imagination.

His experiment  spawned  a host of new theories.

Your actions will only  breed  violence.

He  hatched  a clever scheme.

He  conceived  a brilliant theory of molecular motion.

Universities are  incubators  for new ideas.

The theory of relativity  first saw the light of day  in 1905.

The University of Chicago was the  birthplace  of the nuclear age.

Edward Teller is the  father  of the hydrogen bomb.



These are all instances of the general metaphor  CREATION IS BIRTH . This gives us another instance where a special case of  CAUSATION  is conceptualized metaphorically.

Finally, there is another special case of  CAUSATION  which we conceptualize in terms of the EMERGENCE metaphor. This is the case where a mental or emotional state is viewed as causing an act or event:



He shot the mayor  out of  desperation.

He gave up his career  out of  love for his family.

His mother nearly went crazy  from  loneliness.

He dropped  from  exhaustion.

He became a mathematician  out of  a passion for order.



Here the  STATE  (desperation, loneliness, etc.) is viewed as a container, and the act or event is viewed as an object that emerges from the container. The  CAUSATION  is viewed as the  EMERGENCE  of the  EVENT  from the  STATE .



Summary





As we have just seen, the concept of  CAUSATION  is based on the prototype of  DIRECT MANIPULATION , which emerges directly from our experience. The prototypical core is elaborated by metaphor to yield a broad concept of  CAUSATION , which has many special cases. The metaphors used are  THE OBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE, THE SUBSTANCE GOES INTO THE OBJECT, CREATION IS BIRTH , and  CAUSATION  (of event by state) Is emergence (of the event/object from the state/container).

We also saw that the prototypical core of the concept  CAUSATION , namely,  DIRECT MANIPULATION , is not an un-analyzable semantic primitive but rather a consisting of properties that naturally occur together in our daily experience of performing direct manipulations. The prototypical concept  DIRECT MANIPULATION  is basic and primitive in our experience, but not in the sense required by a "building-block" theory. In such theories, each concept either  is  an ultimate building block or can be broken down into ultimate building blocks in one and only one way. The theory we will propose in the next chapter suggests, instead, that there are natural dimensions of experience and that concepts can be analyzed along these dimensions in more than one way. Moreover, along each dimension, concepts can often be analyzed further and further, relative to our experience, so that there are not always ultimate building blocks.

Thus there are three ways in which  CAUSATION  is not an unanalyzable primitive:



—It is characterized in terms of family resemblances to the prototype of  DIRECT MANIPULATION .

—The  DIRECT MANIPULATION  prototype itself is an indefinitely analyzable gestalt of naturally cooccurring properties.

—The prototypical core of  CAUSATION  is elaborated metaphorically in various ways.

The Coherent Structuring of Experience









Experiential Gestalts and the Dimensions of Experience





We have talked throughout of metaphorical concepts as ways of partially structuring one experience in terms of another. In order to see in detail what is involved in metaphorical structuring, we must first have a clearer idea of what it means for an experience or set of experiences to be coherent by virtue of having a structure. For example, we have suggested that an argument is a conversation that is partially structured by the concept war (thus giving us the  ARGUMENT  i S WAR metaphor). Suppose you are having a conversation and you suddenly realize that it has turned into an argument. What is it that makes a conversation an argument, and what does that have to do with war? To see the difference between a conversation and an argument, we first have to see what it means to be engaged in a conversation.

The most basic kind of conversation involves two people who are talking to each other. Typically, one of them initiates it and they take turns talking about some common topic or set of topics. Maintaining the turn-taking and keeping to the topic at hand (or shifting topics in a permissible fashion) takes a certain amount of cooperation. And whatever other purposes a conversation may have for the participants, conversations generally serve the purpose of polite social interaction.

Even in as simple a case as a polite two-party conversation, several dimensions of structure can be seen:



Participants:  The participants are of a certain natural kind, namely, people. Here they take the role of speakers. The conversation is defined by what the participants do, and the same participants play a role throughout the conversation.



Parts:  The parts consist of a certain natural kind of activity, namely, talking. Each turn at talking is a part of the conversation as a whole, and these parts must be put together in a certain fashion for there to be a coherent conversation.



Stages:  Conversations typically have a set of initial conditions and then pass through various stages, including at least a beginning, a central part, and an end. Thus there are certain things that are said in order to initiate a conversation ("Hello!", "How are you?", etc.), others that move it along to the central part, and still others that end it.



Linear sequence:  The participants' turns at speaking are ordered in a linear sequence, with the general constraint that the speakers alternate. Certain overlappings are permitted, and there are lapses where one speaker doesn't take his turn and the other speaker continues. Without such constraints on linear sequencing of parts, you get a monologue or a jumble of words but no conversation.



Causation:  The finish of one turn at talking is expected to result in the beginning of the next turn.



Purpose:  Conversations may serve any number of purposes, but all typical conversations share the purpose of maintaining polite social interaction in a reasonably cooperative manner.



There are many details that could be added that characterize conversation more precisely, but these six dimensions of structure give the main outlines of what is common to typical conversations.

If you are engaged in a conversation (which has at least these six dimensions of structure) and you perceive it turning into an argument, what is it that you perceive over and above being in a conversation? The basic difference is a sense of being embattled. You realize that you have an opinion that matters to you and that the other person doesn't accept it. At least one participant wants the other to give up his opinion, and this creates a situation where there is something to be won or lost. You sense that you are in an argument when you find your own position under attack or when you feel a need to attack the other person's position. It becomes a full-fledged argument when both of you devote most of your conversational energy to trying to discredit the other person's position while maintaining your own. The argument remains a conversation, although the element of polite cooperation in maintaining the conversational structure may be strained if the argument becomes heated.

The sense of being embattled comes from experiencing yourself as being in a warlike situation even though it is not actual combat—since you are maintaining the amenities of conversation. You experience the other participant as an adversary, you attack his position, you try to defend your own, and you do what you can to make him give in. The structure of the conversation takes on aspects of the structure of a war, and you act accordingly. Your perceptions and actions correspond in part to the perceptions and actions of a party engaged in war. We can see this in more detail in the following list of characteristics of argument:



You have an opinion that matters to you.  (having a position)

The other participant does not agree with your opinion,  (has a different position)

It matters to one or both of you that the other give up his opinion  (surrender)  and accept yours  (victory), (he is your

adversary)

The difference of opinion becomes a conflict of opinions. (conflict)

You think of how you can best convince him of your view  (plan strategy)  and consider what evidence you can bring to bear on the issue  (marshal forces).

Considering what you perceive as the weaknesses of his position, you ask questions and raise objections designed to force him ultimately to give up his position and adopt yours.



(attack)



You try to change the premises of the conversation so that you will be in a stronger position,  (maneuvering)

In response to his questions and objections, you try to maintain your own position,  (defense)

As the argument progresses, maintaining your general view may require some revision,  (retreat)

You may raise new questions and objections,  (counterattack)

Either you get tired and decide to quit arguing  *(truce),  or neither of you can convince the other ( stalemate ), or one of you gives in.  (surrender)



What gives coherence to this list of things that make a conversation into an argument is that they correspond to elements of the concept WAR. What is added from the concept war to the concept  CONVERSATION  can be viewed in terms of the same six dimensions of structure that we gave in our description of conversational structure.



Participants:  The kind of participants are people or groups of

people. They play the role of adversaries.



Parts:  The two positions

Planning strategy

Attack

Defense

Retreat

Maneuvering

Counterattack

Stalemate Truce

Surrender/victory



Stages:  Initial conditions: Participants have different

positions. One or both

wants the other to surren-

der. Each participant

assumes he can defend his

position.

Beginning: One adversary attacks.

Middle: Combinations of defense

maneuvering

retreat

counterattack

End: Either truce or stalemate or surrender/ victory

Final state: Peace, victor has dominance over loser



Linear sequence:     Retreat after attack

Defense after attack

Counterattack after attack

Causation:      Attack results in defense or counterattack or

retreat or end.

Purpose:       Victory



Understanding a conversation as being an argument involves being able to superimpose the multidimensional structure of part of the concept WAR upon the corresponding structure  CONVERSATION . Such multidimensional structures characterize  experiential gestalts , which are ways of organizing experiences into  structured wholes.  In the  ARGUMENT IS WAR  metaphor, the gestalt for  CONVERSATION  is structured further by means of correspondences with selected elements of the gestalt for war. Thus one activity, talking, is understood in terms of another, physical fighting. Structuring our experience in terms of such multidimensional gestalts is what makes our experience  coherent.  We experience a conversation as an argument when the war gestalt fits our perceptions and actions in the conversation.

Understanding such multidimensional gestalts and the correlations between them is the key to understanding coherence in our experience. As we saw above,  experiential gestalts are multidimensional structured wholes.  Their dimensions, in turn, are defined in terms of directly emergent concepts. That is, the various dimensions (participants, parts, stages, etc.) are categories that emerge naturally from our experience. We have already seen that causation is a directly emergent concept, and the other dimensions in terms of which we categorize our experience have a fairly obvious experiential basis:



Participants:  This dimension arises out of the concept of the self as an actor distinguishable from the actions he performs. We also distinguish  kinds  of participants (e.g., people, animals, objects).



Parts:  We experience ourselves as having parts (arms, legs, etc.) that we can control independently. Likewise, we experience physical objects either in terms of parts that they naturally have or parts that we impose upon them, either by virtue of our perceptions, our interactions with them, or our uses for them. Similarly, we impose a part-whole structure on events and activities. And, as in the case of participants, we distinguish  kinds  of parts (e.g., kinds of objects, kinds of activities, etc.).



Stages:  Our simplest motor functions involve knowing where we are and what position we are in (initial conditions), starting to move (beginning), carrying out the motor function (middle), and stopping (end), which leaves us in a final state.



Linear sequence:  Again, the control of our simplest motor functions requires us to put them in the right linear sequence.



Purpose:  From birth (and even before), we have needs and desires, and we realize very early that we can perform certain actions (crying, moving, manipulating objects) to satisfy them.



These are some of the basic dimensions of our experience. We classify our experiences in such terms. And we see  coherence  in diverse experiences when we can categorize them in terms of gestalts with at least these dimensions.



What Does It Mean for a Concept to Fit an Experience?





Let us return to the experience of being in a conversation that turns into an argument. As we saw, being in a conversation is a structured experience. As we experience a conversation, we are automatically and unconsciously classifying our experience in terms of the natural dimensions of the  CONVERSATION  gestalt: Who's participating? Whose turn is it? (= which part?) What stage are we at? And so on. It is in terms of imposing the  CONVERSATION  gestalt on what is happening that we experience the talking and listening that we engage in as a particular  kind  of experience, namely, a conversation. When we perceive dimensions of our experience as fitting the WAR gestalt in addition, we become aware that we are participating in another  kind  of experience, namely, an argument. It is by this means that we classify particular experiences, and we need to classify our experiences in order to comprehend, so that we will know what to do.

Thus we classify particular experiences in terms of experiential gestalts in our conceptual system. Here we must distinguish between: (1) the experience itself, as we structure it, and (2) the concepts that we employ in structuring it, that is, the multidimensional gestalts like conversation and ARGUMENT. The concept (say, CONVERSATION) specifies certain natural dimensions (e.g., participants, parts, stages, etc.) and how these dimensions are related. There is a correlation, dimension by dimension, between the concept  CONVERSATION  and the aspects of the actual activity of conversing. This is what we mean when we say that a concept fits an experience.

It is by means of conceptualizing our experiences in this manner that we pick out the "important" aspects of an experience. And by picking out what is "important" in the experience, we can categorize the experience, understand it, and remember it. If we were to tell you that we had an argument yesterday, we would be telling you the truth if our concept of an  ARGUMENT , with us as participants, fits an experience that we had yesterday, dimension by dimension.



Metaphorical Structuring versus Subcategorization





In our discussion of the concept  ARGUMENT , we have been assuming a clear-cut distinction between subcategorization and metaphorical structuring. On the one hand, we took "An argument is a conversation" to be an instance of subcategorization, because an argument is basically a  kind  of conversation. The same kind of activity occurs in both, namely, talking, and an argument has all the basic structural features of a conversation. Thus our criteria for subcategorization were  (a)  same kind of activity and ( b ) enough of the same structural features. On the other hand, we took  ARGUMENT IS WAR   to be a metaphor because an argument and a war are basically different kinds of activity, and ARGUMENT is partially structured in terms of WAR. Argument is a different kind of activity because it involves talking instead of combat. The structure is partial, because only selected elements of the concept WAR are used. Thus our criteria for metaphor were  (a)  a difference in kind of activity and (b) partial structuring (use of certain selected parts).

But we cannot always distinguish subcategorization from metaphor on the basis of these criteria. The reason is that it is not always clear when two activities (or two things) are of the same kind or of different kinds. Take, for example, an  ARGUMENT  I S A FIGHT . Is this a subcategorization or a metaphor? The issue here is whether fighting and arguing are the same kind of activity. This is not a simple issue. Fighting is an attempt to gain dominance that typically involves hurting, inflicting pain, injuring, etc. But there is both physical pain and what is called psychological pain; there is physical dominance and there is psychological dominance. If your concept fight includes psychological dominance and psychological pain on a par with physical dominance and pain, then you may see  AN ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT  as a subcategorization rather than a metaphor, since both would involve gaining psychological dominance. On this view an argument would be a kind of fight, structured in the form of a conversation. If, on the other hand, you conceive of fight as purely physical, and if you view psychological pain only as pain taken metaphorically, then you might view  AN ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT  as metaphorical.

The point here is that subcategorization and metaphor are endpoints on a continuum. A relationship of the form A is Β (for example,  AN ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT ) will be a clear subcategorization if A and Β are the same kind of thing or activity and will be a clear metaphor if they are clearly different kinds of things or activities. But when it is not clear whether A and Β are the same kind of thing or activity, then the relationship A is Β falls somewhere in the middle of the continuum.

The important thing to note is that the theory outlined in chapter 14 allows for such unclear cases as well as for the clear ones. The unclear cases will involve the same kinds of structures (with the same dimensions and the same possible complexities) as the clear cases. In an unclear case of the form A is B, A and Β will both be gestalts that structure certain kinds of activities (or things), and the only question will be whether the activities or things structured by those gestalts are of the same  kind.

We have so far characterized coherence in terms of experiential gestalts, which have various dimensions that emerge naturally from experience. Some gestalts are relatively simple ( CONVERSATION ) and some are extremely elaborate (WAR). There are also complex gestalts, which are structured partially in terms of other gestalts. These are what we have been calling  metaphorically structured concepts.  Certain concepts are structured almost entirely metaphorically. The concept  LOVE , for example, is structured mostly in metaphorical terms:  LOVE IS A JOURNEY ,  LOVE IS A PATIENT, LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE ,  LOVE IS MADNESS ,  LOVE IS WAR , etc. The concept of love has a core that is minimally structured by the subcategorization love is an emotion and by links to other emotions, e.g., liking. This is typical of emotional concepts, which are not clearly delineated in our experience in any direct fashion and therefore must be comprehended primarily indirectly, via metaphor.

But there is more to coherence than structuring in terms of multidimensional gestalts. When a concept is structured by more than one metaphor, the different metaphorical structurings usually fit together in a coherent fashion. We will now turn to other aspects of coherence, both within a single metaphorical structuring and across two or more metaphors.

Metaphorical Coherence









Specialized Aspects of a Concept









So far we have looked at the concept ARGUMENT in enough detail to get a sense of its general overall structure. As is the case with many of our general concepts, the concept ARGUMENT has specialized aspects that are used in certain subcultures or in certain situations. We saw, for example, that in the academic world, legal world, etc., the concept ARGUMENT is specialized to RATIONAL ARGUMENT, which is distinguished from everyday, "irrational" argument. In RATIONAL ARGUMENT the tactics are  ideally  restricted to stating premises, citing supporting evidence, and drawing logical conclusions. In practice, as we saw, the tactics of everyday argument (intimidation, appeal to authority, etc.) appear in actual "rational" argument in a disguised or refined form. These additional restrictions define RATIONAL ARGUMENT as a specialized branch of the general concept argument. Moreover, the purpose of argument is further restricted in the case of rational argument. In the ideal case, the purpose of winning the argument is seen as serving the higher purpose of understanding.

Within RATIONAL ARGUMENT itself there is a further specialization. Since written discourse rules out the dialogue inherent in two-party arguments, a special form of one-party argument has developed. Here speaking typically becomes writing, and the author addresses himself, not to an actual adversary, but to a set of hypothetical adversaries or to actual adversaries who are not present to defend themselves, counterattack, etc. What we have here is the specialized concept ONE-PARTY RATIONAL ARGUMENT.

Finally, there is a distinction between an argument as a  process  (arguing) and an argument as a  product  (what has been written or said in the course of arguing). In this case, the process and the product are intimately related aspects of the same general concept, neither of which can exist without the other, and either of which can be focused on. Thus we speak of the stage of an argument as applying indifferently to the process or the product.

A ONE-PARTY RATIONAL ARGUMENT is a specialized branch of the general concept argument and, as such, has many special constraints on it. Since there is no particular adversary present, an idealized adversary must be assumed. If the purpose of victory is to be maintained, it must be victory over an idealized adversary who is not present. The only way to guarantee victory is to be able to overcome all possible adversaries and to win neutral parties over to your side. To do this, you have to anticipate possible objections, defenses, attacks, etc., and deal with them as you construct your argument. Since this is a RATIONAL ARGUMENT, all of these steps must be taken, not just to win, but in the service of the higher purpose of understanding.

The further restrictions placed on one-party rational arguments require us to pay special attention to certain aspects of argument which are not so important (or perhaps not even present) in everyday argument. Among them are:



Content:  You have to have enough supporting evidence and say enough of the right things in order to make your point and to overcome any possible objections.

Progress:  You have to start with generally agreed upon premises and move in linear fashion toward some conclusion.

Structure:  RATIONAL ARGUMENT requires appropriate logical connections among the various parts.

Strength:  The ability of the argument to withstand assault depends on the weight of the evidence and the tightness of the logical connections.

Basicness :  Some claims are more important to maintain and defend than others, since subsequent claims will be based upon them.

Obviousness:  In any argument there will be things which are not obvious. These need to be identified and explored in sufficient detail.

Directness:  The force of an argument can depend on how straightforwardly you move from premises to conclusions.

Clarity:  What you are claiming and the connections between your claims must be sufficiently clear for the reader to understand them.



These are aspects of a one-party rational argument that are not necessarily present in an ordinary everyday argument. The concept CONVERSATION and the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor do not focus on these aspects, which are crucial to idealized rational argument. As a result, the concept RATIONAL ARGUMENT is further defined by means of other metaphors which  do  enable us to focus on these important aspects: an argument is a journey,AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER, and AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING. As we will see, each of these gives us a handle on some of the above aspects of the concept RATIONAL ARGUMENT. No one of them is sufficient to give us a complete, consistent, and comprehensive understanding of all these aspects, but together they do the job of giving us a coherent understanding of what a rational argument is. We will now take up the question of what it means for various different metaphors, each of which partially structures a concept, to jointly provide a coherent understanding of the concept as a whole.





Coherence within a Single Metaphor









We can get some idea of the mechanism of coherence within a single metaphorical structuring by starting with the metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY. This metaphor has to do with the goal of the argument, the fact that it must have a beginning, proceed in a linear fashion, and make progress in stages toward that goal. Here are some obvious instances of the metaphor:



AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY

We have  set out  to prove that bats are birds.

When we get to the next point,  we shall see that philosophy is dead.

So far,  we've seen that no current theories will work.

We will  proceed  in a  step-hy-step  fashion.

Our  goal  is to show that hummingbirds are essential to military defense.

This observation  points the way to  an elegant solution.

We have  arrived at  a disturbing conclusion.



One thing we know about journeys is that a JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH.



A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH

He  strayed from  the path.

He's  gone off in the wrong direction.

They'r e following  us.

I'm  lost.



Putting together AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY AND A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH, we get:



AN ARGUMENT DEFINES A PATH



He  strayed from the line  of argument

Do you  follow  my argument?

Now we've  gone off in the wrong direction  again.

I'm  lost.

You're  going around in circles.



Moreover, paths are conceived of as surfaces (think of a carpet unrolling as you go along, thus creating a path behind you):



THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE



We  covered  a lot of ground. He's  on  our trail.

He strayed  off  the trail.

We went back  over  the same trail.



Given that AN ARGUMENT DEFINES A PATH AND THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE, we get:



THE PATH OF AN ARGUMENT IS A SURFACE



We have already  covered  those points.

We have  covered  a lot of  ground  in our argument.

Let's go back  over  the argument again.

You're getting  off  the subject.

You're really  onto  something there.

We're well  on  our  way  to solving this problem.



Here we have a set of cases that fall under the metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY. What makes them systematic is a pair of metaphorical entailments that are based on two facts about journeys.





The facts about journeys:





A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH

THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE





The metaphorical entailments:





AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY

A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH



Therefore, AN ARGUMENT DEFINES A PATH

AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY

THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE



Therefore, THE PATH OF AN ARGUMENT IS A SURFACE



Here metaphorical entailments characterize the  internal  systematicity of the metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY, that is, they make coherent all the examples that fall under that metaphor.





Coherence between Two Aspects of a Single Concept









AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY is only one of the metaphors for arguments, the one we use to highlight or talk about the goal, direction, or progress of an argument. When we want to talk about the content of an argument, we use the structurally complex metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER. Containers can be viewed as defining a limited space (with a bounding surface, a center, and a periphery) and as holding a substance (which may vary in amount, and which may have a core located in the center). We use the ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER metaphor when we want to highlight any of these aspects of an argument.



AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER



Your argument doesn't have much  content.

That argument  has holes in it.

You don't have  much of an  argument, but his objections have even  less substance.

Your argument is  vacuous.

I'm tired of your  empty  arguments.

You won't  find  that idea  in  his argument.

That conclusion  falls out of  my argument.

Your argument  wont hold water.

Those points are  central  to the argument—the rest is  peripheral.

I still haven't gotten to the  core  of his argument.



Since the purposes of the JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors are different, that is, since they are used to focus in detail on different aspects of an argument (goal and progress versus content), we would not expect these metaphors to overlap completely. It is possible in some cases to focus jointly on both the JOURNEY (progress) and CONTAINER (content) aspects of an argument. Thus we get certain mixed metaphors that display both of these aspects at once.



Overlap between JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors:



At this point  our argument doesn't have  much content.

In  what we've done  so far,  we have provided the  core  of our argument.

If we keep  going the way we're going,  we'll  fit all the facts in.



What makes this overlap possible is that the JOURNEYand CONTAINER metaphors have shared entailments. Both metaphors allow us to distinguish the form of the argument from the content. In the JOURNEY metaphor, the path corresponds to the form of the argument and the ground covered corresponds to the content. When we are going around in circles, we may have a long path, but we don't cover much ground; that is, the argument doesn't have much content. In a good argument, however, each element of form is used to express some content. In the JOURNEY metaphor, the longer the path (the longer the argument), the more ground is covered (the more content the argument has). In the CONTAINER metaphor, the bounding surface of the container corresponds to the form of the argument, and what is in the container corresponds to the "content" of the argument. In a container that is designed and used most efficiently, all of the bounding surface is used to hold content. Ideally, the more surface there is (the longer the argument), the more substance there is in the container (the more content the argument has). As the path of the journey unfolds, more and more of the surface defined by that path is created, just as more and more of the surface of the container is created. The overlap between the two metaphors is the progressive creation of a surface. As the argument covers more ground (via the journey surface), it gets more content (via the CONTAINER surface).

What characterizes this overlap is a shared entailment that arises in the following way.





A nonmetaphorical entailment about journeys:





As we make a journey, more of a path is created.

A PATH IS A SURFACE.



Therefore, As we make a journey, more of a surface is created.





A metaphorical entailment about arguments (based on journeys):



AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY.

As we make a journey, more of a surface is created.



Therefore, As we make an argument, more of a surface is created.





A metaphorical entailment about arguments (based on containers):



AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY.

As we make a container, more of a surface is created.



Therefore, As we make an argument, more of a surface is created.



Here the two metaphorical entailments have the same conclusion. This can be represented by the accompanying diagram.











It is this overlap of entailments between the two metaphors that defines the coherence between them and provides the link between the amount of ground the argument covers and the amount of content it has. This is what allows them to "fit together," even though they are not completely consistent, that is, there is no "single image" that completely fits both metaphors. The surface of a container and the surface of the ground are both surfaces by virtue of common topological properties. But our image of ground surface is very different than our images of various kinds of container surfaces. The abstract topological concept of a surface which forms the overlap between these two metaphors is not concrete enough to form an image. In general when metaphors are coherent but not consistent, we should not expect them to form consistent images.

The difference between coherence and consistency is crucial. Each metaphor focuses on one aspect of the concept ARGUMENT: in this, each serves a single purpose. Moreover, each metaphor allows us to understand one aspect of the concept in terms of a more clearly delineated concept, e.g., JOURNEY OR CONTAINER. The reason we need two metaphors is because there is no one metaphor that will do the job—there is no one metaphor that will allow us to get a handle simultaneously on both the direction of the argument and the content of the argument. These two purposes cannot both be served at once by a single metaphor. And where the purposes won't mix, the metaphors won't mix. Thus we get instances of impermissible mixed metaphors resulting from the impossibility of a single clearly delineated metaphor that satisfies both purposes at once. For example, we can speak of the  direction  of the argument and of the  content  of the argument but not of the  direction of the content  of the argument nor of the  content of the direction  of the argument. Thus we do not get sentences like:



We can now follow the  path  of the  core  of the argument.

The  content  of the argument  proceeds  as follows.

The  direction  of his argument has no  substance.

I am disturbed by the  vacuous path  of your argument.



The two metaphors would be consistent if there were a way to  completely  satisfy both purposes with one clearly delineated concept. Instead, what we get is coherence, where there is a partial satisfaction of both purposes. For instance, the JOURNEY metaphor highlights both direction and progress toward a goal. The CONTAINER metaphor highlights the content with respect to its amount, density, centrality, and boundaries. The  progress  aspect of the JOURNEY metaphor and the  amount  aspect of the CONTAINER metaphor can be highlighted simultaneously because the amount increases as the argument progresses. And, as we saw, this results in permissible mixed metaphors.

So far we have looked at the coherences between two metaphorical structurings of the concept argument, and we have found the following:



—Metaphorical entailments play an essential role in linking all of the instances of a  single  metaphorical structuring of a concept (as in the various instances of the AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY metaphor)

.

—Metaphorical entailments also play an essential role in linking  two different  metaphorical structurings of a single concept (as in the JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors for ARGUMENT).



—A shared metaphorical entailment can establish a cross-metaphorical correspondence. For example, the shared entailment AS WE MAKE AN ARGUMENT, MORE OF A SURFACE IS CREATED establishes a correspondence between the amount of ground covered in the argument (which is in the JOURNEY metaphor) and the amount of content in the argument (which is in the CONTAINER metaphor).



—The various metaphorical structurings of a concept serve different purposes by highlighting different aspects of the concept.



—Where there is an overlapping of purposes, there is an overlapping of metaphors and hence a coherence between them. Permissible mixed metaphors fall into this overlap.



—In general, complete consistency across metaphors is rare; coherence, on the other hand, is typical.
