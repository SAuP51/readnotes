## Afterword

Collaborating on this book has given us the opportunity to explore our ideas not only with each other but with literally hundreds of people—students and colleagues, friends, relatives, acquaintances, even strangers at the next cafe table. And after having worked out all of the consequences we could think of, for philosophy and for linguistics, what stands out most in our minds are the metaphors themselves and the insights they have given us into our own daily experiences. We still react with awe when we notice ourselves and those around us living by metaphors like  TIME IS MONEY, LOVE IS A JOURNEY, and PROBLEMS ARE PUZZLES.  We continually find it important to realize that the way we have been brought up to perceive our world is not the only way and that it is possible to see beyond the "truths" of our culture.

But metaphors are not merely things to be seen beyond. In fact, one can see beyond them only by using other metaphors. It is as though the ability to comprehend experience through metaphor were a sense, like seeing or touching or hearing, with metaphors providing the only ways to perceive and experience much of the world. Metaphor is as much a part of our functioning as our sense of touch, and as precious.

## Afterword, 2003

This small book has contributed to the study of the human mind in ways we could not have dreamed of when we wrote it two decades ago. Our original motivation was to awaken readers throughout the world to the often beautiful, sometimes disturbing, but always profound, realities of everyday metaphorical thought.

By bringing metaphorical thought into the limelight, this book revealed the need to rethink some of the most fundamental ideas in the study of mind: meaning, truth, the nature of thought, and the role of the body in the shaping of mind. As a result it had far-reaching implications in field after field—not just linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy but also literary studies, politics, law, clinical psychology, religion, and even mathematics and the philosophy of science.

How we think metaphorically matters. It can determine questions of war and peace, economic policy, and legal decisions, as well as the mundane choices of everyday life. Is a military attack a "rape, " "a threat to our security, " or "the defense of a population against terrorism"? The same attack can be conceptualized in any of these ways with very different military consequences. Is your marriage a partnership, a journey through life together, a haven from the outside world, a means for growth, or a union of two people into a third entity? The choice among such common ways of conceptualizing marriage can determine what your marriage becomes. Drastic metaphorical differences can result in marital conflict. Take for example the case where one spouse views marriage as a partnership, and the other spouse views it as a haven. The responsibilities of a partnership may well be at odds with the relief from responsibilities characteristic of a haven.

Metaphorical thought is normal and ubiquitous in our mental life, both conscious and unconscious. The same mechanisms of metaphorical thought used throughout poetry are present in our most common concepts: time, events, causation, emotion, ethics, and business, to name but a few. Conceptual metaphors even lie behind the building of computer interfaces (e. g., the desktop metaphor) and the structuring of the Internet into "information highways, " "department stores, " "chat rooms, " "auction houses, " "amusement parks, " and so on. It is the systematicity of metaphorical thought that permits such applications.

The heart of metaphor is inference. Conceptual metaphor allows inferences in sensory-motor domains (e. g., domains of space and objects) to be used to draw inferences about other domains (e. g., domains of subjective judgment, with concepts like intimacy, emotions, justice, and so on). Because we reason in terms of metaphor, the metaphors we use determine a great deal about how we live our lives.

### 01. Persistent Fallacies

There are four major historical barriers to understanding the nature of metaphorical thought and its profundity, and these amount to four false views of metaphor. In the Western tradition, they all go back at least as far as Aristotle. The first fallacy is that metaphor is a matter of words, not concepts. The second is that metaphor is based on similarity. The third is that all concepts are literal and that none can be metaphorical. The fourth is that rational thought is in no way shaped by the nature of our brains and bodies.

Further research subsequent to this book has established conclusively that all four views are false. First, the locus of metaphor is in concepts not words. Second, metaphor is, in general, not based on similarity, as we argued throughout this book. Instead, it is typically based on cross-domain correlations in our experience, which give rise to the perceived similarities between the two domains within the metaphor. For example, the persistent use of a metaphor may create perceived similarities, as when a love relationship, conceived of metaphorically as a partnership, goes awry when responsibilities and benefits are not shared equally. Third, even our deepest and most abiding concepts—time, events, causation, morality, and mind itself— are understood and reasoned about via multiple metaphors. In each case, one conceptual domain (say, time) is reasoned about, as well as talked about, in terms of the conceptual structure of another domain (say, space). Fourth, the system of conceptual metaphors is not arbitrary or just historically contingent; rather, it is shaped to a significant extent by the common nature of our bodies and the shared ways that we all function in the everyday world.

Yet, despite all the evidence for the pervasiveness of conceptual metaphor, these long-standing, mistaken assumptions not just about metaphor but about meaning in general have persisted. These age-old, a priori philosophical views are so deeply engrained that they blind many readers to any evidence to the contrary.

The single biggest obstacle to understanding our findings has been the refusal to recognize the  conceptual  nature of metaphor. The idea that metaphors are nothing but linguistic expressions—a mere matter of words—is such a common fallacy that it has kept many readers from even entertaining the idea that we think metaphorically. The fallacy is that metaphor is only about the ways we  talk  and not about conceptualization and reasoning.

Countering this view is a huge body of empirical evidence gained from many different methods of inquiry that reveals the central role of metaphor in abstract thought. It is not surprising that someone raised with the traditional view would continue to deny or ignore this evidence, since to accept it would require large-scale revisions of the way he or she understands not only metaphor but concepts, meaning, language, knowledge, and truth as well.

Because there is so much at stake, these fallacies about metaphor are difficult to eliminate. They have been around for over two thousand years. Yet they are wrong, that is, they are at odds with the empirical evidence. The fact that they are wrong is no small matter. It has implications for all aspects of our lives, including war and peace, the environment, health, and other political and social issues. It bears directly on how we understand our own personal lives, and it bears directly on intellectual disciplines like philosophy, mathematics, and literary studies, all of which ultimately have important cultural effects.

### 02. Evidence for Conceptual Metaphor

It is crucial to recognize that questions about the nature of meaning, conceptualization, reasoning, and language are questions requiring empirical study; they cannot be answered adequately by mere a priori philosophizing. The nature of metaphor also is not a matter of definition; it is a question of the nature of cognition.







Do we systematically use inference patterns from one conceptual domain to reason about another conceptual domain?







The empirically established answer is "yes. " We call that phenomenon  conceptual metaphor,  and we call the systematic correspondences across such domains  metaphorical mappings.  This leads to a further empirical question:







Are those metaphorical mappings purely abstract and arbitrary?







The empirical answer is "no. " They are shaped and constrained by our bodily experiences in the world, experiences in which the two conceptual domains are correlated and consequently establish mappings from one domain to another. Finally, there is a corresponding question about the nature of language:







Is all ordinary, conventionalized, everyday language literal, or can common everyday linguistic expressions be metaphorical?







The answer is empirical: A great deal of everyday, conventional language is metaphorical, and the metaphorical meanings are given by conceptual metaphorical mappings that ultimately arise from correlations in our embodied experience.

In short, metaphor is a natural phenomenon. Conceptual metaphor is a natural part of human thought, and linguistic metaphor is a natural part of human language. Moreover, which metaphors we have and what they mean depend on the nature of our bodies, our interactions in the physical environment, and our social and cultural practices. Every question about the nature of conceptual metaphor and its role in thought and language is an empirical question.

What is needed is still more empirical research that seeks converging evidence and is gathered by using different empirical methods of inquiry. Multiple methods of inquiry, with different methodological assumptions, have been used effectively to date. This has allowed researchers to avoid having evidence dictated a priori by the assumptions of any one particular methodology (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 6).

In 1980 we had evidence for the theory of conceptual metaphor from only two areas of research:



Systematic polysemy:  In this area of research, entire lexical fields of words not only have literal meanings in a concrete domain but also have systematically related meanings in abstract domains. For example,  up, down, rise, fall, high, low, hit bottom , and so on, are not only about verticality but also quantity. Thus, the conceptual metaphor More Is Up explains why we use the polysemous word  rise , for example, to mean both increase in elevation and increase in quantity. The conceptual metaphor explains the systematicity of the polysemy, and correspondingly, the systematic polysemy provides evidence for the existence of the metaphor.



Generalizations over inference patterns:  A fundamental finding here is that reasoning in abstract domains uses the logic of our sensory-motor experience. For example, if something rises physically, it is higher than it was before. If the price of something "rises" (metaphorically), then it is "higher" (metaphorically) than it was before. The metaphor More Is Up maps the inference pattern about physical heights onto the inference pattern about amounts. By hypothesizing the metaphor, we can see that these two apparently different inference patterns are in fact the same. Moreover, by hypothesizing a  single  More Is Up metaphor mapping verticality to quantity, we could account for both the polysemous use of words and the generalization over inferences. In other words, there were then two sources of evidence—polysemy and inference—for that conceptual metaphor.

After twenty years of research by hundreds of investigators, vast bodies of empirical evidence for conceptual metaphor have been gathered from studies in a wide range of fields within the cognitive sciences. We initially had two primary sources of evidence—polysemy generalizations and inference generalizations. We now have at least seven other types of evidence derived from various empirical methods:







extensions to poetic and novel cases (Lakoff and Turner 1989)

psychological research, for example, priming studies (Gibbs 1994; Boroditzky 2000)

gesture studies (McNeill 1992)

historical semantic change research (Sweetser 1990)

discourse analysis (Narayanan 1997)

sign language analysis (Taub 1997)

language acquisition (C. Johnson 1999)





The importance of this evidence is that it comes from many different methodologies and no longer rests exclusively on data from linguistic forms and inferences. These new sources have produced converging results concerning the way metaphor lies at the heart of abstract thought and symbolic expression.



Developments in Metaphor Theory





Over the years, the theory of metaphor has developed and deepened considerably. The evidence for the existence and pervasiveness of conceptual metaphor has mounted, giving us a much clearer picture of how metaphor structures thought. Initially we had only guessed that conceptual metaphors were grounded in bodily experience. In the early 1980s, Lakoff and Kövecses showed that the system of metaphors for anger arose, across languages and cultures, from the physiology of anger itself (Lakoff 1987; Kövecses 1986, 1990).

By the early 1990s, a whole new level of metaphor analysis was discovered that we will call  deep analysis.  What we and other researchers found was that our most fundamental ideas—not just time, but events, causation, morality, the self, and so on—were almost entirely structured by elaborate systems of conceptual metaphor. Even the basic concepts of causation used in the physical and social sciences are primarily constituted by a system of nearly two dozen distinct metaphors, each with its own causal logic (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 11). Thus, causation can be conceptualized in terms of forced motion to a new location (as in, "Scientific developments have  propelled  us into the Digital Age"), the giving and taking of objects ("These vitamins will  give  you energy"), links ("Cancer has been  linked  to pesticide use"), motion along a path ("China is  on the road to  democracy, having taken  the path  of capitalism"), and so on. This discovery was particularly startling, even to us, because it challenged the widespread view that there is a single kind of causation with a single causal logic structuring the world.

Deep analysis further revealed that our basic understanding of morality arises via conceptual metaphor. There is a system of approximately two dozen metaphors that arise spontaneously out of common, everyday experience in cultures around the world (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 15). Since morality is concerned with well-being, whether one's own or that of another, fundamental experiences concerning well-being give rise to conceptual metaphors for morality. People are better off in general if they are strong not weak; if they can stand upright rather than having to crawl; if they eat pure, not rotten, food; and so on. These correlations give rise to metaphors of morality as strength and immorality as weakness, morality as uprightness and immorality as being low, morality as purity and immorality as rot, and so on. Since you are better off if you have the things you need rather than if you don't, there is a correlation of well-being with wealth. Hence, there is a widespread metaphor in which moral action is conceptualized as increasing another's well-being, which is metaphorically understood as increasing their wealth. Immoral action, therefore, is conceptualized as decreasing another's wealth. Thus, if someone does you a favor, you are  in her debt  and seek to  repay  the favor. This is the basis of the metaphor of Moral Accounting, in which morality prescribes a balancing of the moral books.

The deep analysis of morality has important implications for politics, as shown by Lakoff's analysis of liberal and conservative worldviews on morality and politics. This analysis is based on two opposing models of the family, the nurturant parent and the strict father families (Lakoff 1996). Under the metaphor of The Nation as a Family, these opposing family models are transformed into moral and political worldviews that are fundamentally at odds. Such worldview metaphors tend to be so deeply pervasive that they organize other metaphors into moral and political conceptual systems.



Metaphor Composition





In  More Than Cool Reason  (1989), Lakoff and Turner applied deep analysis to metaphors in complex poetic and literary texts. The analysis revealed an anatomy of imagination: new metaphorical ideas—that is, new ways of organizing and understanding experience—arise from the combination of simpler conceptual metaphors to form complex ones. Consequently, innovation and novelty are not miraculous; they do not come out of nowhere. They are built using the tools of everyday metaphorical thought, as well as other commonplace conceptual mechanisms.

For example, Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 uses three metaphors for a lifetime: a day, a year, and a fire. Lakoff and Turner note that these are composite metaphors made up of the following more basic metaphors: Life Is Light and Death Is Darkness, Life Is Heat and Death Is Cold, and A Lifetime Is a Cycle of Waxing and Waning. Days, years, and fires all involve a waxing and waning cycle, with light and heat during waxing and darkness and cold during waning.

In addition, Lakoff and Turner found cases of composition involving both metaphor and metonymy. In the classic figure of the Grim Reaper, there is such a composition. The term "reaper" is based on the metaphor of People as Plants: just as a reaper cuts down wheat with a scythe before it has gone through its life cycle, so the Grim Reaper comes with his scythe indicating a premature death. The metaphor of Death as Departure is also part of the myth of the Grim Reaper. In the myth, the Reaper comes to the door and the deceased departs with him.

The figure of the Reaper is also based on two conceptual metonymies. The Reaper takes the form of a skeleton—the form of the body after it has decayed, a form which metonymically symbolizes death. The Reaper also wears a cowl, the clothing of monks who presided over funerals at the time the figure of the Reaper became popular. Further, in the myth the Reaper is in control, presiding over the departure of the deceased from this life. Thus, the myth of the Grim Reaper is the result of two metaphors and two metonymies having been put together with precision.

Lakoff and Turner thus showed in detail how conceptual metaphors and metonymies can fit together to form complex and novel combinations.



Metaphors for Metaphor





Every scientific theory is constructed by scientists—human beings who necessarily use the tools of the human mind. One of those tools is conceptual metaphor. When the scientific subject matter is metaphor itself, it should be no surprise that such an enterprise has to make use of metaphor, as it is embodied in the mind, to construct a scientific understanding of what metaphor is.

Our first metaphor for conceptual metaphor came from mathematics. We first saw conceptual metaphors as mappings in the mathematical sense, that is, as mappings across conceptual domains. This metaphor proved useful in several respects. It was precise. It specified exact, systematic correspondences. It allowed for the use of source domain inference patterns to reason about the target domain. Finally, it allowed for partial mappings. In short, it was a good first approximation.

However, the Mathematical Mapping metaphor proved to be inadequate in an important respect. Mathematical mappings do not create target entities, while conceptual metaphors often do. For example, time doesn't necessarily have a use and isn't necessarily a resource. Many people in cultures around the world simply live their lives without being concerned about whether they are using their time efficiently. However, other cultures conceptualize time metaphorically as though it were a limited resource. The Time Is Money metaphor imposes on the time domain various aspects of resources. In doing so, it adds elements to the time domain, creating a new understanding of time.

In order to account for this creative aspect, it was necessary to find a more adequate metaphor for conceptual metaphor. We needed a way to think about metaphors so that they could not just be mappings but also could add elements to a domain. We accordingly adopted the Projection Metaphor, based on the image of an overhead projector. We saw a target domain as an initial slide on the projector and metaphorical projection as the process of laying another slide on top of the first one, adding the structure of the source to that of the target. This metaphor for metaphor allowed us to conceptualize the idea that metaphors add extra entities and relations to the target domain.

The Projection metaphor also allowed us to account for another fact. Before this book, it had been discovered that images have a structure. For example, imagine someone walking into a room. The room is conceptualized as a container, and the walking as comprising a path of motion with a beginning outside the room and an ending inside. Containers and Paths are  image-schemas  in the sense that they are primitives that structure rich images. We discovered that the image-schema structure of the source domain is used in reasoning about the target domain. Moreover, by looking at hundreds of cases, we found that image-schema structure and image-schematic inferences seemed to be "preserved" by metaphors. That is, source domain containers (e. g., physical traps) are mapped to containers (e. g., metaphorical traps), with interiors mapped to interiors and exteriors mapped to exteriors. When a conceptual metaphor applies to a Path schema, goals are mapped to goals, origins to origins, and so on. Under the Projection metaphor, this was an immediate consequence.

Unfortunately, the Projection metaphor introduced a major problem. According to the Projection metaphor,  all  of the source domain should be projected onto the target; however, some parts of the source domain are not mapped. In Theories Are Buildings, much is not mapped—the paint, the electrical wiring, and so on. According to the Conduit metaphor, I can  give  you an idea, but I still  have  it, which isn't true in the source domain of physical objects. If I give you a diamond, I no longer have it. In short, mappings tend to be partial, but the Projection metaphor doesn't allow this. Even worse, there is a systematicity about certain aspects of partial mappings. A source domain element is not mapped if it would produce an inference that would contradict the internal structure of the target. In that case, the mapping must be overridden. Thus, we needed to add to the Projection metaphor the ugly idea of  target domain overrides . The unfortunate principle behind this term is "Don't map an element if it would give rise to a contradiction in the target domain. " (Lakoff 1993)

By 1997 the Projection metaphor was abandoned in favor of a neural theory. That theory came out of the Neural Theory of Language project directed by Jerome Feldman and George Lakoff at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley.



Primary Metaphor and the Neural Theory





A major advance in metaphor theory came in 1997 with fundamental insights by Joseph Grady (1997), Christopher Johnson (1997), and Srinivas Narayanan (1997). We had found cases, like More Is Up, in which embodied experience in the world seemed to provide a grounding for metaphors. In More Is Up, for example, we regularly experience an increase in height correlated with an increase in quantity, as when one pours more water into a glass. What had kept us from noticing bodily grounding in its full grandeur was our major concentration on complex metaphors of the sort discussed in this book. Grady showed that complex metaphors arise from  primary metaphors  that are directly grounded in the everyday experience that links our sensory-motor experience to the domain of our subjective judgments. For example, we have the primary conceptual metaphor Affection Is Warmth because our earliest experiences with affection correspond to the physical experience of the warmth of being held closely.

Christopher Johnson has argued that children learn primary metaphors on the basis of the  conflation  of conceptual domains in everyday life. He studied how the Knowing Is Seeing metaphor develops, demonstrating that children first use "see" literally, that is, only about vision. Then there is a stage when seeing and knowing are conflated, when children say things like "See Daddy come in" or "See what I spilled"; seeing occurs together with knowing. Only later do clear metaphorical uses of "see" like "See what I mean" occur. These uses are about knowledge, not literal seeing.

The results of Joseph Grady's and Christopher Johnson's research can be explained by the neural theory of metaphor developed by Srinivas Narayanan (1997). Using computational techniques for neural modeling, Narayanan developed a theory in which conceptual metaphors are computed neurally via neural maps—neural circuitry linking the sensory-motor system with higher cortical areas.

The terms  map  and  mapping  used here come from neuroscience. In the visual system of the brain, neurons  project,  that is, extend, from the retina to the primary visual cortex (VI), with neurons that are adjacent or nearby in the retina projecting to neurons that are adjacent or nearby in VI. The neurons active in VI are said to form a map in VI of the retinal image. The metaphor here is topographic, with the retina as territory and VI as the map.

Similarly, the motor cortex is said to contain a map of the body. Neuronal clusters throughout the body "project" (that is, are connected) to neuronal clusters in the motor cortex, with neuronal clusters adjacent or nearby on the body projecting to neuronal clusters adjacent to or nearby the corresponding clusters in the motor cortex. Maps of such types are common in the brain.

In the neural theory of metaphor, therefore, the terms map and projection take on a whole new meaning. The maps or mappings are physical links: neural circuitry linking neuronal clusters called  nodes.  The  domains  are highly structured neural ensembles in different regions of the brain.

The neural maps are learned via  neural recruitment , the long-term potentiation of neurons connected to the source and target neural ensembles that are coactive during Johnson's period of conflation. (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 4. ) This neural learning mechanism produces a stable, conventional system of primary metaphors that tend to remain in place indefinitely within the conceptual system and are independent of language.

For example, the metaphor Affection Is Warmth (as in, "He's a  warm  person. " or "She's a  block of ice . ") arises from the common experience of a child being held affectionately by a parent; here, affection occurs together with warmth. In Johnson's terms, they are conflated. There is neuronal activation occurring simultaneously in two separate parts of the brain: those devoted to emotions and those devoted to temperature. As the saying goes in neuroscience, "Neurons that fire together wire together. " Appropriate neural connections between the brain regions are recruited. These connections physically constitute the Affection Is Warmth metaphor.

Metaphor is a neural phenomenon. What we have referred to as metaphorical mappings appear to be realized physically as neural maps. They constitute the neural mechanism that naturally, and inevitably, recruits sensory-motor inference for use in abstract thought. Primary metaphors arise spontaneously and automatically without our being aware of them. There are hundreds of such primary conceptual metaphors, most of them learned unconsciously and automatically in childhood simply by functioning in the everyday world with a human body and brain. There are primary metaphors for time, causation, events, morality, emotions, and other domains that are central to human thought. Such metaphors also provide a superstructure for our systems of complex metaphorical thought and language.

You don't have a choice as to whether to think metaphorically. Because metaphorical maps are part of our brains, we will think and speak metaphorically whether we want to or not. Since the mechanism of metaphor is largely unconscious, we will think and speak metaphorically, whether we know it or not. Further, since our brains are embodied, our metaphors will reflect our commonplace experiences in the world. Inevitably, many primary metaphors are universal because everybody has basically the same kinds of bodies and brains and lives in basically the same kinds of environments, so far as the features relevant to metaphor are concerned.

The complex metaphors that are composed of primary metaphors and that make use of culturally based conceptual frames are another matter. Because they make use of cultural information, they may differ significantly from culture to culture.



The Neural Basis of Metaphorical Thought





When we imagine seeing a scene, our visual cortex is active. When we imagine moving our bodies, the pre-motor cortex and motor cortex are active. In short, some of the same parts of our brains are active in imagining as in perceiving and doing. We will use the term  enactment  for dynamic brain functions shared both during perceiving and acting and during imagining. An enactment, real or imaginative, is dynamic, that is, it occurs in real time.

Our sensory-motor concepts arise from our sensory-motor experiences (experiences moving in space, perceiving,manipulating objects, and so on). Fixed concepts are neural information structures called  neural parameterizations  that can guide imaginative enactments when activated. Conceptual metaphors, at the neural level, link source domain parameterizations to target domain parameterizations. By this means we can carry out metaphorical enactments—forms of imagination in which abstract reasoning is governed by sensory-motor enactments unfolding in real time and in real contexts.

Multiple enactments are always being carried out by the brain, and single enactments can be guided by multiple parameterizations. Consequently, target domain enactments can be governed by multiple metaphors. This explains why there are complex metaphorical sentences like  I've fallen in love, but we seem to be going in different directions.  Here a number of metaphors structure the enactment: Lack of Control Is Down, as with "fall"; States Are Locations, as with "in love"; Changes Are Motions, as when falling in love is characterized as a change to a new state; and Love Is A Journey, as when lovers may be "going in different directions. " In such a specific target domain enactment, love can be understood in terms of a state (in love), in terms of issues of control (falling), and in terms of the compatibility of the life goals of the lovers (going in different directions).

This is not at all like the old Projection Metaphor. Metaphorical inferences are typically carried out via source domain enactments. The  results  of source domain inferences are carried over to the target domain via neural links. The learning of new metaphors therefore involves only the establishment of new neural connections and not the creation of copies of complex, inferential machinery. No overrides are necessary. The reason is this: Metaphors are learned when two experiences occur at once. If a metaphorical link would result in a contradiction in the target domain, it will not be learned. Neurally, contradictions are mutual inhibitions. Any would-be link that would lead to a contradiction with the inherent structure of the target domain will be inhibited; thus it will never be learned.

Locating the theory of metaphor within the Neural Theory of Language has a number of advantages:



—We gain an explanation via embodiment for how primary metaphors are learned: universal primary metaphors arise from universal primary experiences.

—We gain an explanation for why metaphorical thought exists and why it is normal and inescapable: the regular coactivation of two domains results in the recruitment of neural circuitry linking them.

—No theory of overrides is needed.

—Metaphors fit naturally with the rest of the Neural Theory of Language.

—Neural enactment provides a mechanism for characterizing the dynamic use of metaphor in context and in discourse.

—Since the Neural Theory of Language comes with explicit computational models, there is an explicit computational account of how metaphors operate dynamically.



Metaphor and Dynamic Enactment





We have been concerned with metaphorical inferences since we wrote  Metaphors We Live By.  However, an important distinction between two types of inference has only recently been pointed out. In Narayanan's model (1997), parameterization gives rise to what we will call  structural inferences , which characterize static inferential structure.  Enactment inferences  arise, on the other hand, only in the unfolding of a dynamic process.

An example of a structural inference in the domain of economics would be "Increasing the money supply without increasing production tends to increase inflation. " Such probabilistic inferences characterize the tendencies that structure a national economic system. Compare this with the kind of inference mechanism used to understand the enactment of a physical action, such as "John fell into a ditch and Harry pulled him out. " Here the detailed inferences arise as a result of imagining what happened. John went out of control in falling; he may well have gotten hurt; he couldn't get out by himself; Harry grasped his arm (or other part of his body); Harry had strength or leverage that John did not; Harry exerted force, pulling hard and perhaps injuring himself to some extent; and John gradually came up out of the ditch as Harry pulled. In his modeling of economic discourse (1997), Narayanan took up sentences like,  France fell into a recession and Germany pulled it out.  Here a number of conceptual metaphors and a metonymy are at work. Metaphors: Nations Are People; Economies Are Entities That Move Forward Over Time, up or down; A Recession Is A Hole; Economic Force Is The Use Of Money. Metonymy: A Nation Stands For Its Economy. For example, "France" stands for the French economy.

Narayanan showed that the overall inferences derive from a combination of both types of inference, those being structural inferences about international economics (target domain) and enacted inferences about falling and pulling (source domain). The enacted inferences are embodied; as such, they are carried out in the source domain. Their effects are mapped to the target domain and hence to the discourse space of international economics. The source domain (of falling and pulling) is enacted, and the inferences are mapped to the target domain of international economics. By that means, they influence the reasoning involved in the ongoing discourse about international economics—literal structural inferences and enacted metaphorical inferences mix with each other and with contextual information to give rise to new structure. That new structure does not follow from the source domain alone, the subject matter (target) domain alone, or context alone. Narayanan happened to discuss cases in which only the source domain used enacted inferences. There are other cases in which the target domain also has to be imaginatively enacted.

These technical achievements have given us a neural theory of dynamic metaphor use in enacted discourse, one that has been computationally implemented in significant ways.



Enactment and Blending





The Neural Theory of Language project began in 1988 and continues today. Over roughly the same period, Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner (2002) have developed a theory of blended spaces that, though different in scope and intent, overlaps in important ways with certain aspects of the Neural Theory of Language.

Blending theory takes for granted all of the static, longterm conceptual structure that is used in enactment. In other words, it assumes all the structure that we call parameterizations, including metaphorical mappings from source to target domains, as well as image-schemas, force-dynamic schemas, frames, prototypes, metonymic mappings, and so on. Blending theory is centrally concerned with the use of all this general conceptual structure in particular examples. That is, it is concerned with  conceptual integration:  how conceptual structures are combined for use in particular cases, especially in imaginative cases. What is called blending or conceptual integration in blending theory seems to correspond to  binding  in the neural theory.

Blending theory makes use of Fauconnier's theory of Mental Spaces, relatively small mental models of particular situations that have been structured by the concepts in our conceptual systems. A blended space is a mental space that imaginatively combines elements of at least two other mental spaces that are structured by our ordinary long-term conceptual system.

Here is a simple example of a blend that recently appeared on TV: a Jewish pizza. A Jewish cooking show featured Wolfgang Puck, the noted Austrian chef from LA, famous for his elegant pizzas and married to a Jewish woman. His Jewish pizza starts with a pizza dough baked with finely sliced red onions then topped with crème fraiche (an elegant French variant of sour cream), finely chopped shallots, lox, salmon caviar, and finely chopped dill. The pizza dough is the element taken from the conventional pizza, and the Jewish elements are the lox, crème fraiche (sour cream a la Wolfgang Puck), onion, and so on.

As an object in the world, the Jewish pizza is just what it is: lox, dough, onions, a cultured cream, etc. But conceptually (and tastewise), it is a blend of elements from pizzas and elements from Jewish cooking. As the Jewish pizza has become a staple of Puck's repertoire, it has become a food concept of its own. Although for the most part it leaves in place the concept of pizza and the concept of Jewish cooking, it makes a slight extension of both concepts and thereby extends the idea of Jewish cooking and the idea of what a pizza is.

According to Blending Theory, this would be a blend with two  input spaces:  a space structured by parts of the conceptual domain of ordinary pizza and a space structured by parts of the conceptual domain of Jewish cooking. The  idea  of Jewish pizza is a conceptual blend of the ideas in those input spaces. The space containing the idea of the Jewish pizza is the  blended space —a new conceptual product of an operation of blending elements.

The Neural Theory of Language provides a neural underpinning for the theory of conceptual blends. Blends are formed by both neural mappings and neural bindings. In a neural binding, two conceptual entities are seen as being the same entity. In the Jewish pizza, the pizza topping  is the same entity as  the lox with crème fraiche. The neural mapping would link the pizza schema with the open-faced loxon-bagel schema. Such a neural structure, with both mappings and bindings, forms a blend at the conceptual level.

Here we see what the two theories accomplish, one at the cognitive level and the other at the neural level.

The Jewish pizza blend is obviously a literal blend, so literal that you can actually make one and eat it. Fauconnier and Turner (2002) have observed that there are also metaphoric blends, blends that arise when one input space is structured by the source domain of an existing conceptual metaphor in the conceptual system, and the other input space is structured by the target domain of that metaphor. Of course, there need not be a blended space whenever a conceptual metaphor is used. Take a sentence like "Steel prices rose. " This is an instance of More Is Up. When steel sellers are charging more for their steel, the situation is conceptualized and spoken of in terms of a spatial rise. But there need be no entity that is rising in space.

However, blends are possible with this metaphor. Imagine a graph of changes in steel prices that is structured by the More Is Up metaphor—"higher" prices are literally higher on the graph—and by the Change is Motion and Fictive Motion metaphors, in which changes are movements and a line represents the path of a moving entity from left to right. In this graph, the line is tilted higher on the right side, indicating in the literal drawing that prices have become higher metaphorically. What makes this a blend is a  binding  (in Neural Theory of Language terms): an identification of prices charged with the heights of points on the line in the graph.

Over more than a decade, Fauconnier and Turner have collected hundreds of examples of imaginative blends, including metaphorical blends, demonstrating beyond doubt that blends are a feature of our everyday mental life. Fauconnier and Turner have also looked at length at the properties of blends, discovering principles that make for  good  blends. In the Neural Theory of Language, the corresponding enterprise is to explain, in terms of neural computation, neural learning and neural optimization,  why  the particular properties and principles found by Fauconnier and Turner exist.

The Neural Theory of Language and Blending Theory are very different enterprises, which happen to overlap in subject matter in certain cases. Blending theory focuses on conceptual integration at the level of spaces, the level of the formation of particular cases from preexisting conceptual structures. It also looks at the conventionalization of these blends, a process by which blends may become part of conceptual structure.

The Neural Theory of Language also focuses on conceptual integration. In addition, it seeks a precise, overall computational neural account of language as a whole and of the ideas expressed by language. It is concerned both with formally characterizing parameterizations and with precisely building computational models of embodied enactments. The Neural Theory of Language also concentrates on modeling learning, both the learning of concepts and the learning of language to express those concepts. So far as metaphor is concerned, the Neural Theory of Language attempts to explain on neural grounds why we have the primary metaphors we have.



Some Corrections and Clarifications





This book was our first attempt to spell out the nature of metaphorical thought and its relation to language. Inevitably, we made some mistakes. Here are some revisions:

The division of metaphors into three types—orienta-tional, ontological, and structural—was artificial. All metaphors are structural (in that they map structures to structures); all are ontological (in that they create target domain entities); and many are orientational (in that they map orientational image-schemas).

We did not yet see the profundity of primary metaphor, and, as a result, some of our analyses were incomplete. This was evident, for example, in our analysis of Argument Is War. Many readers have correctly observed that most people learn about argument before they learn about war. The metaphor actually originates in childhood with the primary metaphor Argument Is Struggle. All children struggle against the physical manipulations of their parents; and, as language is learned, the physical struggle comes to be accompanied by words. The conflation of physical struggle with associated words in the development of all children is the basis for the primary metaphor Argument Is Struggle. As we grow up, we learn about more extended and violent struggles like battles and wars, and the metaphor is extended via that knowledge.

The distinction between metaphor and metonymy is real but often confusing. Here is the basic distinction:



In a  metaphor,  there are two domains: the target domain, which is constituted by the immediate subject matter, and the source domain, in which important metaphorical reasoning takes place and that provides the source concepts used in that reasoning. Metaphorical language has literal meaning in the source domain. In addition, a metaphoric mapping is multiple, that is, two or more elements are mapped to two or more other elements. Image-schema structure is preserved in the mapping—interiors of containers map to interiors, exteriors map to exteriors; sources of motion to sources, goals to goals, and so on.

In a  metonymy,  there is only one domain: the immediate subject matter. There is only one mapping; typically the metonymic source maps to the metonymic target (the referent) so that one item in the domain can stand for the other.



Although these are considerable differences, it is understandable why there is occasional confusion between metaphor and metonymy. First, in both cases there is a conceptual mapping which has a reflection in language: a linguistic expression with meaning A expressing meaning B. If you are mostly looking at the surface forms of the language, rather than at the conceptual systems and inferential structure, you may not be looking in the right place to notice the difference. Second, there is neural coactivation in both metaphor and metonymy. In metaphor, there is coactivation of two domains; in metonymy there is coactivation of two frame elements. However, a single  complex  frame may be formed from simple frames coming from two different conceptual domains. For example, the Time-For-A-Trip frame brings together the domains of Time and Space in a way that is not metaphorical. In this frame, there is a correlation between time and distance, with a mapping from times to distances that can be traveled in those times. Thus there can be a Time-For-Distance metonymy, as in:



(Metonymy) San Francisco is  a half hour from  Berkeley.



Here the time  (a half hour)  stands metonymically for the distance. Notice that the time is from the Time domain and the distance is from the Space domain. This is a mapping of an element from one domain to an element of another. It is a metonymy, not a metaphor, because the two domains are part of a single, literal frame and because there is a single mapping, not a multiple mapping.

Compare this case with the spatial metaphor for time that arises from a correlation in experience between time and location, as in:



(Metaphor) Chanukah is  close to  Christmas.



In the metaphor, Time is the target domain and Space is the source domain. In the sentence given, the relationship between the times of the two holidays is given metaphorically in terms of space  (close to).  Here Time is the subject matter of the sentence and Space is not; it is only the conceptual source. In the metonymy case, the relationship between time and space (the time for the trip) is the subject matter of the sentence.

The moral is this: When distinguishing metaphor and metonymy, one must not look only at the meanings of a single linguistic expression and whether there are two domains involved. Instead, one must determine how the expression is used. Do the two domains form a single, complex subject matter in use with a single mapping? If so, you have metonymy. Or, can the domains be separate in use, with a number of mappings and with one of the domains forming the subject matter (the target domain), while the other domain (the source) is the basis of significant inference and a number of linguistic expressions? If this is the case, then you have metaphor.



Applications of Metaphor Theory





In the twenty-five years since we first discovered conceptual metaphor, researchers in fields as diverse as literary theory, legal studies, linguistics, and the philosophy of science have made exciting applications of the theory. They have identified conceptual metaphors at the heart of poetry, law, politics, psychology, physics, computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Their research reveals how metaphor structures how we think—and even what thoughts are permitted—in the following intellectual disciplines:



Literary Analysis.  In  More Than Cool Reason  (1989), Lakoff and Turner demonstrated that metaphors in poetry are, for the most part, extensions and special cases of stable, conventional conceptual metaphors used in everyday thought and language. The metaphoric innovations of poets are shown thereby to consist not in the totally new creation of metaphoric thought but in the marshalling of already existing forms of metaphoric thought to form new extensions and combinations of old metaphorical mappings.

Lakoff and Turner also showed that conventional conceptual metaphor lies at the heart of proverbs; and, in  Death Is the Mother of Beauty  (1987), Turner showed how everyday conceptual metaphor can form the basis of allegory when applied to plot structure. In  The Literary Mind  (1996), Turner then demonstrated how metaphoric blends lie behind the construction of fables and of other common products of the literary imagination.

The metaphorical basis of the moral dimension of literature becomes apparent from the discussion of metaphor and morality by Johnson in  Moral Imagination  (1993), by Lakoff in  Moral Politics  (1996), and by Lakoff and Johnson in  Philosophy in the Flesh  (1999).



Politics, Law; and Social Issues . The most important application of the theory of conceptual metaphor has been in the areas of law, politics, and social issues. Legal theorist Steven Winter has written extensively in law review articles and in a major book,  A Clearing in the Forest  (2001), about the central role of metaphor in legal reasoning. Legal metaphors abound, from the metaphor of the Corporation As Person (with First Amendment rights), to the metaphor of real property as bundles of rights, to the evolving metaphorical understanding of intellectual property. As Winter shows, it is common for the Supreme Court to use metaphors to extend legal categories developed in previous decisions. Metaphor is thus a powerful legal tool that has effects throughout our social lives.

Lakoff's essay "Metaphor and War, " distributed to many millions over the Internet on the eve of the Gulf War, remains one of the most important analyses not only of the use of metaphor by the U. S. government to persuade the populace but also of the role of conceptual metaphors in planning foreign policy. It shows in detail how the metaphors used within the U. S. government to conceptualize the political and economic situation in Iraq systematically hid the most dreadful consequences of that war. The chapter on rationality in Lakoff and Johnson's  Philosophy in the Flesh  (1999) is a thorough analysis of the metaphorical structure of the rational actor model used widely in economics and politics and of what that model hides.

Lakoff's  Moral Politics  (1996) analyzes the political worldviews of conservatives and progressives in America. Lakoff asks why their respective views on abortion, gun control, the death penalty, taxation, social programs, the environment, and art fit together into two opposing frameworks that are each sensible and coherent. The answer is that these views are held together by pervasive metaphors for morality that are in turn organized by opposing idealized models of the family. Conservative intellectuals have explicitly articulated the main outlines of the family-morality-politics connections, but, for the most part, progressives have not. The book provides progressives with a guide to understanding their own moral system. It shows how that system unites various kinds of progressives and what the overall moral basis is behind progressive as well as conservative politics. The analysis applies to every major social issue in America.



Psychology . Metaphor analysis has proved important for both cognitive and clinical psychology. Cognitive psychology is dominated by the old idea that concepts are all literal and disembodied. The literature on metaphor theory provides overwhelming evidence against that view and opens the possibility for a much more interesting cognitive psychology, which to some extent already exists (Gibbs 1994). For example, considerable research has been done on the metaphorical conceptualization of emotions (Lakoff 1987, Case Study 1; Kövecses 1990) as well as on metaphors for the self (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 13), mind, memory, and attention (Fernandez-Duque and Johnson 1999).

The promise of metaphor theory for clinical psychology is enormous. We now know enough of our unconscious metaphor systems to reveal how they affect our lives as individuals and what  personal  metaphors we have developed over our lifetimes to make sense of our lives. We also know what basic metaphors there are for marriage and love and how spouses may differ in their metaphors. Such differences can lead to enormous difficulties. Lakoff's  Moral Politics  describes crucially important differences in family models and how these differences may affect later life (1996). Though skilled therapists may have well-developed intuitions in this area, metaphor theory provides a systematic guide to the cognitive and affective dimensions of our sense of self. (For a discussion of the application of metaphor theory to dreams, see Lakoff 1997).



Mathematics . If any area has been taken to be literal, disembodied, and objective, it is mathematics. Yet Lakoff and Nunez have shown that mathematics too is metaphorical through and through (2000). Take the number line. Numbers don't have to be points on a line. It is a metaphor that Numbers Are Points on a Line, just as it is a metaphor that Numbers Are Sets, which is used in the set-theoretical foundations for mathematics developed in the late nineteenth century.  Where Mathematics Comes From , by Lakoff and Nunez (2000), is a massive study of the metaphorical structure of mathematics, from arithmetic to set theory and logic, to forms of infinity, to classical advanced mathematics. Mathematics turns out not to be a disembodied, literal, objective feature of the universe but rather an embodied, largely metaphorical, stable intellectual edifice constructed by human beings with human brains living in our physical world.



Cognitive Lingustics.  Metaphor Theory is a central subdiscipline of the field of cognitive linguistics, which seeks to provide explanatory foundations for conceptual systems and language in the general study of the brain and the mind. As such, it draws on, and seeks to integrate, recent work in cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology to form a unified picture that can explain as many aspects of language as possible, from syntax to semantics to discourse. Other central developments in cognitive linguistics include:







the semantics of closed-class elements such as spatial relations (Talmy 2000)

studies of category structure, including basic-level categories, prototypes, and radial categories (Lakoff 1987)

mental spaces (Fauconnier 1985; Fauconnier and Sweetser 1996)

frame semantics (Fillmore 1982, 1985; Sweetser 1990)

blended spaces (Fauconnier and Turner 1998, 2002)

cognitive grammar (Langacker 1986, 1990, 1991)

cognitive construction grammar (Goldberg 1995; Lakoff 1987, Case Study 3).





The Neural Theory of Language is being developed. It seeks to provide a unified theory of thought and language based on neural computation (Regier 1996; Narayanan 1997; Feldman and Lakoff, forthcoming).



Philosophy. Metaphors We Live By  began partly as an attempt to answer influential claims about metaphor made by two major contemporary American philosophers—Donald Davidson, who claimed that metaphors are meaningless, and John Searle, who claimed that there are semantic and pragmatic principles that allow one to assign literal meanings to metaphorical sentences. We realized that their arguments rested on common assumptions held both in analytic philosophy and throughout the Western tradition, namely, that concepts are all conscious, literal, and disembodied, that is, not crucially shaped by the body and brain.

As we discuss in the final chapters of this book, the facts of conceptual metaphor theory are incompatible with many major assumptions of Western philosophy: it is just not true that all thought is conscious, literal, and disembodied. Over the two decades since we finished this book, we have struggled to figure out what philosophy would look like if we started with the empirical results from embodied cognitive science about the mind and language and reconstructed philosophy anew. The results of these labors are presented in  Philosophy in the Flesh  (1999), which is a broad and deep rethinking of the nature of:







truth and science;

basic philosophical concepts such as time, events, causation, the mind, the self, morality, being and essence;

the metaphorical structure that defines the fundamental forms of reason used by great philosophers from the Presocratics, Plato, and Aristotle, to Descartes and Kant, to contemporary analytic philosophers such as Quine;

the consequences for a new view of what a human being is, what religion and spiritual experience are, and what the job of philosophy itself is.







Summary





The theory of metaphor has come a long way from the humble beginnings presented in this slim volume. Yet, most of the key ideas in this book have been either sustained or developed further by recent empirical research in cognitive linguistics and in cognitive science generally. These key ideas are the following:



—Metaphors are fundamentally conceptual in nature; metaphorical language is secondary.

—Conceptual metaphors are grounded in everyday experience.

—Abstract thought is largely, though not entirely, metaphorical.

—Metaphorical thought is unavoidable, ubiquitous, and mostly unconscious.

—Abstract concepts have a literal core but are extended by metaphors, often by many mutually inconsistent metaphors.

—Abstract concepts are not complete without metaphors. For example, love is not love without metaphors of magic, attraction, madness, union, nurturance, and so on.

—Our conceptual systems are not consistent overall, since the metaphors used to reason about concepts may be inconsistent.

—We live our lives on the basis of inferences we derive via metaphor.





The Present Situation

In spite of the massive and growing evidence for them, our basic claims have nonetheless met resistance for an obvious reason: they are inconsistent with assumptions that many people in the academic world and elsewhere first learned and that shaped the research agendas they still pursue. Many mainstream philosophers, linguists, and psychologists either have vehemently denied these claims or have preferred to ignore them and to go about their ordinary business as if the claims were false. The reason is clear— our claims strike at the heart of centuries-old assumptions about the nature of meaning, thought, and language. If the new empirical results are taken seriously, then people throughout our culture have to rethink some of their most cherished beliefs about what science and philosophy are and reconsider their values from a new perspective.

Above all, the key sticking point is the existence of  conceptual  metaphor. If conceptual metaphors are real, then all literalist and objectivist views of meaning and knowledge are false. We can no longer pretend to build an account of concepts and knowledge on objective, literal foundations. This constitutes a profound challenge to many of the traditional ways of thinking about what it means to be human, about how the mind works, and about our nature as social and cultural creatures.

At the same time, what we have discovered is fundamentally at odds with certain key tenets of postmodernist thought, especially those that claim that meaning is ungrounded and simply an arbitrary cultural construction.

What has been discovered about primary metaphor, for example, simply does not bear this out. There appear to be  both  universal metaphors  and  cultural variation.

For these reasons, this book remains just as controversial and radical today as when it first appeared. It calls into question business as usual and requires new collaborative cross-disciplinary methods of inquiry.
