# 0101. The Pursuit of Intelligence

Organizations pursue intelligence. It is not a trivial goal. Its realization is imperfect, and the pursuit is endless. Every day there are failures to temper any successes. Nevertheless, the pursuit is often exhilarating. It exalts the subtle textures of life and elevates coping with ordinary tasks to the artistry of history. The present book considers one aspect of the pursuit of intelligence — the effort to extract lessons from the unfolding episodes of life. Organizations and the individuals in them try to improve by contemplating and reacting to their experiences.

Folk wisdom both trumpets the significance of experience and warns of its inadequacies. On the one hand, experience is described as the best teacher. On the other hand, experience is described as the teacher of fools, of those unable or unwilling to learn from accumulated knowledge or the teaching of experts. The disagreement between the folk aphorisms reflects profound questions about the human pursuit of in telligence through learning from experience that have long confronted philosophers and social scientists.

Despite extensive enthusiasm for it, the prima facie evidence for organizational improvement through extracting lessons from experience is mixed. Contemporary organizations certainly engage in practices, follow procedures, and exhibit forms that are notably different from organizations of a century ago. By most measures of productivity, contemporary organizations are more efficient than their predecessors. At the same time, experience is often ambiguous and the inferences to be drawn from it are unclear; and the contribution of experiential learning to long-term improvements in organizations is difficult to establish. The ambiguity of history makes the matching of beliefs and actions to experience both complicated and prone to misdirection (March and Olsen 1975; 1995, chap. 6).

There are well-documented cases of the apparent failure of organizations to adapt to their environments. Failures of business firms to copy successful practices from other firms are a familiar refrain of organizations research. Wars are filled with instances of what appears, with the clear vision of after-the-fact perspicacity, to be organizational blindness on the part of armies. The hugely successful American steel and automobile industries of the first half of the twentieth century withered in the last half. The American public school system changed from being the pride of the country and the envy of other countries to being an embarrassment. The American political system found it difficult to adapt to declines in American prosperity and power as the twenty-first century began.

While acknowledging the power of learning from experience and the extensive use of experience as a basis for adaptation and for constructing stories and models of history, the chapters in this book examine particularly the problems with such learning. The essays argue that although individuals and organizations are eager to derive intelligence from experience, the inferences stemming from that eagerness are often misguided. The problems lie partly in correctable errors of human inference forming, but they lie even more in properties of experience that confound learning from it (March 2008, chap. 5). As a result, the book is somewhat more conservative about the possibilities for experiential learning than is characteristic of some writings about it (Kolb 1984; Sternberg and Wagner 1986; Kayes 2002). It identifies some endemic ambiguities and mistakes of experience.

追求智慧

组织追求智慧。智慧追求，目标远大，永无止境，过程艰难曲折。然而，智慧追求往往令人振奋。智慧追求具有升华作用，让世俗的生活充满诗意，让平凡的日子充满乐趣。本书探讨智慧追求的一个方面：从生活经验当中挖掘启示。组织和组织中的个人试图通过反思经验并做出反应来获得进步。

民间智慧既宣扬经验的重要性，又提醒人们经验的不足之处。一方面，民谚把经验说成最好的老师；另一方面，民谚又把经验说成傻瓜的老师，以及那些不能或不愿从书本知识中学习或接受专家指导之人的老师。有关经验的民谚莫衷一是，这说明人类通过从经验中学习来追求智慧这一做法存在一些深刻的问题。多年以来，这些问题一直困扰着哲学家和社会科学家。

尽管很多组织热衷于从经验中学习，但是初步证据显示从经验中学习并不一定带来改进。诚然，与一个世纪以前的组织相比，当代组织在实务、流程和形式方面有了很大的变化。根据大多数生产率指标来判断，当代的组织比以前的组织效率更高。与此同时，经验往往是模糊的，其中待做的推断是不清楚的；体验式学习对组织长期改进的贡献很难确定。因为历史是模糊的，所以经验与信念、与行动的匹配既复杂又容易出错（March and Olsen 1975；1995，第 6 章）。

组织在适应环境的过程中会遭受失败（表面上的失败，不一定是真正的失败），这样的案例比比皆是、有据可考。组织研究有个十分常见的主题：为什么给某公司带来成功的做法被搬到其他公司后并不一定带来成功？战场之中，扑朔迷离之事时有发生，类似的，组织之中，「事后诸葛亮」现象屡见不鲜。美国的钢铁业和汽车业在 20 世纪上半叶非常成功，下半叶却逐渐衰败。公立学校制度，以前是美国人的骄傲，让其他国家羡慕，现在却让美国人觉得尴尬。进入 21 世纪，美国开始丧失霸主地位，但是美国的政治制度很难随之做出调整。

本书承认从经验中学习具有威力，也承认很多组织和个人根据经验适应环境、建构历史故事和模型，不过本书打算专门考察从经验中学习存在哪些问题。本书的论点是，个人和组织尽管渴望从经验中获取智慧，但是在这种渴望之下从经验当中做出的推断往往具有误导性。问题部分在于人类在做推断的过程中容易出现错误（这些错误一般是可以纠正的），但是更多在于经验自身的性质（March 2008，第 5 章）。结果，与大多数探讨体验式学习的书和文章不同，本书不是那么看好体验式学习的潜力（Kolb 1984；Sternberg and Wagner 1986；Kayes 2002）。本书打算指出经验特有的一些模糊性和体验式学习容易出现的一些错误。

## 1.1 Prolegomenon

The ideas pursued in this book reflect three rather different traditions of scholarship. The first is the tradition of scholarship on organizations. That tradition draws particularly from economics, psychology, management science, sociology, political science, public administration, and artificial intelligence. For the most part, scholars within the tradition are Cartesian, scientific, and analytical. They emphasize the formal analysis of data and testing of hypotheses, exercising models, and proving theorems. They are prone to deductive cleverness in the form of relatively limited but provocative ideas, as reflected in enthusiasms for such things as game theory, cognitive dissonance, structural equivalence, absorptive capacity, and garbage-can theories. They practice a style of analysis that focuses on relatively simple relations among discrete variables. They speak, for the most part, from the perspective of the social and behavioral science establishments. And they presume a history that moves haltingly toward greater knowledge and intellectual progress.

The second tradition is that of scholarship on storytelling, narrative, and myth. These humanistic traditions of scholarship draw particularly from literature, criticism, history, anthropology, linguistics, legal studies, and religion. They emphasize language, metaphor, and the elaboration of meaning. Like Dario Fo, who emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages, attacking authority and glorifying the dignity of the downtrodden, many of them place themselves in opposition to the establishment. They are prone to expansive speculation in the form of sweeping generalizations in the manner of Freud, Marx, or Foucault but also revel in close investigation of the human estate in its fine detail. They practice a style of scholarship that exploits the nuances of language to evoke meanings. And they generally eschew notions of intellectual progress in favor of ideas of intellectual and historical embeddedness, social construction, and cultural consciousness.

The third tradition is that of scholarship on adaptive processes. Although the work is intertwined with empirical studies of change, it is heavily theoretical. It emphasizes properties of the mechanisms of adaptation in organisms, species, technologies, organizations, industries, and societies. The traditions of research on adaptation draw heavily from evolutionary biology and psychological ideas about human learning. They attempt to further understanding by identifying adaptive processes and exploring their consequences in complex ecologies of multiple adapting agents. They pay particular attention to the capabilities of adaptive processes to realize outcomes that are, in some meaningful sense, improvements — even optimal. They generally presume a historical process that is heavily history-dependent with multiple unstable equilibria, but an intellectual process that allows some elements of nonrandom forward movement.

The chapters in this book draw copiously and inadequately from all three traditions, but they focus on a relatively narrow topic: When and how do organizations learn intelligently from their experience? What are the possibilities and problems? The chapters address such issues, but they hardly resolve them. They have all the limitations and perversities of brevity.

Among other limitations, strictly organizational factors in organizational learning from experience are subordinated in these chapters to the ambiguous features of experience, the structural features of adaptive processes, and the intellective features of human adaptation. Organizational factors are discussed from time to time, but there is no attempt to be exhaustive with respect to them. The subordination is one of convenience, not a symptom of unimportance. Organizations shape the way experience unfolds and the way in which it is observed and comprehended. They define the networks through which information flows and reinforce or reduce the cleavages of conflict. They create and maintain the goals and expectations that calibrate aspirations. They are systems of rules, routines, capabilities, and identities that both resist and record the lessons of experience. Such factors can be ignored only as a temporary expediency, and even so at some risk.

In addition, three critical properties of organizational adaptation that are vital to a thorough understanding are not considered significantly here. First, organizations are coalitions of conflicting interests (March 1988, chap. 5; Hoffman 1999; Rao, Morrill, and Zald 2000). Conflicts of interest make theories of conflict-free adaptation notoriously incomplete, complicating particularly the association of success or failure with outcomes and the pooling of information (Cyert and March 1963; Augier and March 2001). Conflicts of interest are conspicuous factors in all organizations and influence not only the pursuit of intelligence but also its definition (Greenwood, Suddaby, and Hinings 2002; Olsen 2009).

Second, organizational adaptation involves the simultaneous, interacting adaptation of several nested levels (March 1994, chaps. 2, 6; Friedland and Alford 1991). Populations of organizations evolve at the same time as the individual organizations within the populations, and organizations evolve at the same time as individuals within the organizations. These nested systems of adaptation affect each other, with adaptation at one level sometimes serving as a substitute for adaptation at another and sometimes interfering with it.

Third, the environment of organizations consists, in part, in other adapting organizations; and the elements of coevolution produced by their simultaneous adjustments are an essential feature of the adaptive story (Hannan and Freeman 1989; Kauffman and Johnsen 1992; Levinthal and Myatt 1994). The treatment of the environment as exogenous, as is common in the literature on organizational learning and, to a substantial extent, in these chapters, is a significant simplification.

绪论

本书抽样介绍的各种观点可以归到三大不同学派。

第一个是组织学派，专门借鉴经济学、心理学、管理学、社会学、政治学、公共行政管理学和人工智能学。这个学派的学者，大多是笛卡儿信徒，崇尚科学，擅长分析。他们强调用正式方法分析数据、检验假设、考验模型、证明定理。他们喜欢一板一眼地演绎，追求简练但推广性强的理论，从他们对博弈理论、认知协调理论、结构均衡理论、吸收能力理论、垃圾桶理论之类东西的痴迷中可见一斑。他们的风格是，分析离散变量之间相对简单的关系。他们主要从社会和行为科学中的成规定见的角度说话。他们认为，历史是蹒跚着进步的，知识和智慧随着历史的发展而增长。

第二个是叙事学派。这个学派偏人文主义，专门借鉴文学、评论、史学、人类学、语言学、法学研究和宗教。这个学派的学者强调语言、暗喻、阐述意义。他们当中有很多人就像效仿中世纪宫廷小丑抨击权威人士、捍卫下层人民尊严的达理奥·福（Dario Fo）一样，把自己放在成规定见的对立面。他们喜欢天马行空地揣测，经常像弗洛伊德或者福科（Foucault）那样以偏概全，但是也喜欢对人类状况刨根问底。他们的风格是，琢磨语言的细微之处，从中挖掘意义。他们一般避而不谈智慧增长，而是宣扬智慧与历史相互嵌套的理念以及社会建构和文化意识等概念。

第三个是适应学派。这一学派理论性很强，只是偶尔做做实证研究。它强调有机体、物种、技术、组织、行业和社会的适应机制的性质。它大量借鉴进化生物学和心理学有关人类学习的观点。它试图通过明确适应的具体过程并探索有着多个适应体的复杂生态圈的适应结果来加深理解。它特别关注适应能否带来改进甚至最佳（在某个有意义的层面上的改进甚至最佳）。他们一般认为历史有很强的路径依赖性、具有多重均衡，而智慧可以非随机地增长。

本书多而不全地借鉴所有这三个学派，集中关注一个相对较窄的话题：在什么条件下，组织可以通过从经验中学习增长智慧；组织如何通过从经验中学习增长智慧？从经验中学习，有什么潜力、什么问题？本书探讨这些问题，但不大可能解决这些问题。本书篇幅小，具有篇幅小的读物的一切局限和缺陷。

在各种局限和缺陷中，尤其需要提到的一个是，在探讨影响组织体验式学习的各种因素时，本书把严格意义的组织因素置于经验的模糊性、适应的结构性和人类适应的智慧性之下。本书会不时提到组织因素，但并不打算深入探讨组织因素。这种做法只是权宜之举，并不表明组织因素不重要。经验如何展开、人们如何观察并理解经验和组织有关。组织定义信息流动网络，增加或减少冲突点。组织根据抱负设立目标、形成期望，围绕目标和期望而行动。组织是由既抵制又记录经验启示的规则、程序、能力和身份构成的系统。这样的因素不容忽略，除非是权宜之举；忽略这样的因素存在风险，即使是权宜之举。

另外，组织适应有三大关键特征对透彻理解至关重要，但是本书没有考虑这三大关键特征。第一，组织内部存在利益冲突（March 1988，第 5 章；Hoffman 1999；Rao，Morrill，and Zald 2000）。这一点，让忽略利益冲突的组织适应理论出了名地不完善，特别是，让成败判定、信息汇集变得非常复杂（Cyert and March 1963；Augier and March 2001）。利益冲突是所有组织的显著特征，不仅影响对智慧的追求，而且影响对智慧的定义（Greenwood，Suddaby，and Hinings 2002；Olsen 2009）。

第二，组织适应涉及数个嵌套水平的同步交互适应（March 1994，第 2，6 章；Friedland and Alford 1991）。组织群在演化，与此同时，组织群内部的个体组织也在演化；组织在演化，与此同时，组织内部的个人也在演化。这些嵌套适应系统相互影响，一个水平的适应有时会替代另外一个水平的适应，有时会干扰另外一个水平的适应。

第三，在某种程度上，组织的环境是由其他组织构成的，因此，组织适应的一个基本特点是多个组织同步调整、共同演化（Hannan and Freeman 1989；Kauffman and Johnsen 1992；Levinthal and Myatt 1994）。大部分有关组织学习的研究都把环境看成外源的，本书也打算这么做，这么做是一种明显的简化。

## 1.2 Two Components of Intelligence

Intelligence normally entails two interrelated but somewhat different components. The first involves effective adaptation to an environment. In order to adapt effectively, organizations require resources, capabilities at using them, knowledge about the worlds in which they exist, good fortune, and good decisions. They typically face competition for resources and uncertainties about the future. Many, but possibly not all, of the factors determining their fates are outside their control. Populations of organizations and individual organizations survive, in part, presumably because they possess adaptive intelligence; but survival is by no means assured. Although a few organizations, most notably the Roman Catholic Church and older European universities, have survived for many years, the vast majority of organizations endure for only a relatively short time. By that criterion, at least, organizational adaptive intelligence is not guaranteed. It is not even typical.

The second component of intelligence involves the elegance of interpretations of the experiences of life. Such interpretations encompass both theories of history and philosophies of meaning, but they go beyond such things to comprehend the grubby details of daily existence. The desire of human beings to make sense of their experiences permeates much of scholarship. It also permeates much of life. Interpretations of experience are ornaments of casual conversations and of theories of psychological, economic, political, cultural, and social systems. Stylishness of interpretation is a certification of human status and a basis for the social ranking of individuals and institutions. Interpretations decorate human existence. They make a claim to significance that is independent of their contribution to effective action. Raymond Fischesser, a former director of L’École des mines de Paris, defined intelligence as「la préoccupation efficace de l’essentiel」(Riveline 2008, 7). Such intelligence glories in the contemplation, comprehension, and appreciation of life, not just the control of it.

智慧的两个要素

智慧一般包括两个相互联系但有所不同的要素。

第一个是，有效地适应环境。为了有效地适应，组织必须拥有资源、有能力利用资源、了解所在的世界、运气好、决策好。组织一般会面临资源竞争和未来的不确定性。决定组织命运的因素，很多（但可能并非全部）不由组织掌控。组织群和个体组织能够生存下来，应该部分是因为拥有适应智慧。生存绝对是没有保证的事情。尽管少数组织存活了数个世纪，其中最著名的是罗马天主教会（Roman Catholic Church）和欧洲的几所老牌大学，但是绝大多数组织只能存活相对较短的时间。从那个标准来看，并非所有的组织都拥有适应智慧，甚至是并非一般的组织都拥有适应智慧。

第二个要素是，优雅地诠释经验。这样的诠释，既包含历史理论又包含意义哲学，但是为了理解日常存在的琐碎细节，又要超越历史理论和意义哲学之类的东西。人类渴望理解经验，这一渴望渗透在大部分的学术研究中，还渗透在大部分的生活中。诠释经验是闲聊的点缀品，也是有关心理体系、经济体系、政治体系、文化体系或社会体系的理论的点缀品。对个人和机构而言，对经验做出时髦的诠释，地位和排名就会得到保障。诠释装饰着人类存在。诠释是重要的，这种重要性与诠释是否有助于有效行动并没关系。巴黎矿院（Ecole des Mines de Paris）前任校长雷蒙德·费斯彻赛尔（Raymond Fischesser）把智慧定义为「有效地关注重要之事」（la preoccupation efficace de l'essentiel）Riveline 2008，7）。这样的智慧，因为反思、理解并欣赏生活而伟大，并不仅仅因为掌控生活而伟大。

## 1.3 Expential Learning

The tools for achieving intelligence reflect the knowledge technologies of the time and place. At some not-too-distant times and places, intelligence seeking involved extensive use of magic potions, enchantments, and incantations, as well as the anticipations and ambiguities of oracles and other keepers of extrahuman capabilities. No self-respecting manager of early Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, or Roman enterprise would have willingly confronted the uncertainties of life without a suitable pipeline to the gods who manipulated the universe within which their organizations operated.

Though various forms of godlike revelation continue to secure adherents (Eisenstadt 2006), efforts to access the mysteries of the gods have been largely replaced in modern life by efforts to uncover more mundane secrets of knowledge. In that respect, few ideas are as sacrosanct in contemporary sensibilities as the notion that human beings achieve mastery over their lives through learning from experience. Individuals and organizations try to improve their lots by observing and reacting to their experiences, partly by elementary efforts to reproduce actions associated with success, partly by more elaborate efforts to fit the events of their histories into acceptable causal frames. Experience is venerated; experience is sought; experience is interpreted.

Learning from experience is, of course, by no means the only mechanism of human learning. Indeed, most of what is known by individuals and organizations is not discovered in lessons extracted from the ordinary course of life and work. It is generated by systematic observation and analysis by experts and transmitted by authorities (e.g., in books, through web browsers, by teachers), and accepted (or rejected) without direct experiential confirmation. It reflects, in a general way, academic knowledge rather than experiential knowledge (March 2004).

Nevertheless, in the contemporary literature on organizations, experiential learning continues to be seen as one of the more important sources of adaptation in human action, a mechanism for improving the fit of actions by individuals or organizations to the environments they face (Argyris and Schön 1978; Levitt and March 1988; Huber 1991; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993; Cohen and Sproull 1996; Argote 1999; Nooteboom 2000; Starbuck and Hedberg 2001; Greve 2003). Admirable organizations are described as「learning organizations」; advisers on ways to augment and refine learning abound (Argyris and Schön 1978; Senge 1990); and recent proposals for improving organizations have often emphasized learning from experience (Senge 1990; Olsen and Peters 1996; Dierkes et al. 2001; Zollo and Winter 2002).

Learning from experience is seen as relevant to theories of rational action (Arrow 1972; Coleman 1990; Milgrom and Roberts 1992) as found in game theory (von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944; Luce and Raiffa 1957; Kreps 1990b) and in decision theory (Raiffa 1968; Machina 1987; Anand 1993; Augier and March 2002). It is also seen as relevant to theories of rule-based action (March and Olsen 1989, chap. 2; March 1994, chap. 2) as found in ideas of individual identity, institutions, and social roles. In rational theories, the presumed fundamental basis of intelligent action is a logic of consequences (March and Olsen 1989, chap. 1; March 1994, chap. 1); in rule following, action follows from systems of rules, identities, and roles (Scott and Meyer 1983; Ashforth and Mael 1989; North 1990; Becker 2004; Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, and Hertwig 2006); and the presumed fundamental basis is a logic of appropriateness (Günther 1993; March and Olsen 2006b). Within both perspectives, experiential knowledge is seen as a necessary component of human claims to intelligence. In rational action, organizations are seen as looking forward by looking backward (Gavetti and Levinthal 2000; Zollo and Winter 2002; Gibbons and Roberts 2008). In rule-based action, organizational rules are seen as evolving through experience (Alchian 1950; Nelson and Winter 1982; March, Schulz, and Zhou 2000; Akerlof and Kranton 2005; March and Olsen 2006a).

Thus, considerable effort has been devoted to augmenting the effectiveness of intelligence in organizations by drawing on the evidence of history. Sophisticated instruments of estimation, modeling, and strategic planning have been created and implemented to facilitate marketing, financial, production, and human resource decision making in business firms and to facilitate the efficient and effective delivery of social services in governmental agencies. Elaborate systems of accounts have been developed to facilitate control over organizations by various stakeholders. Very large industries of consultants have arisen to diffuse practices and theories deemed useful. Schools of management have become conspicuous components of modern universities, providing education to large numbers of would-be future managers of both public and private organizations. Management education provides a menu of「good practices,」as well as a kit of theories of markets, politics, operations, and firms.

In order to improve their fit to their environments, organizations frequently undertake changes in organizational practices, procedures, and forms. To be sure, the alternative possibility that the fit of an organization to its environment can be improved more easily by changing the environment than by changing the organization is reflected in strategies common among powerful players. From this perspective, adaptation is for the weak; the strong impose themselves and let others adapt to them. The great empires of history (Rome, China, Ottoman, Spain, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States) have all thrived in part by forcing their environments to adapt to them, rather than wasting energy in trying to adapt to their environments. The same thing is true of the great industrial empires (US Steel, General Motors, Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever, Sony, IBM, Microsoft). It is true also of the human species. The long run disadvantage of improving fit by changing the environment is — as all of the examples illustrate — a decay of the ability to adapt to the environment if necessary, a decay that accelerates decline if a dominant position is lost.

The search for aids to experiential learning in organizations has been paralleled by a substantial empirical and theoretical effort in organization studies to develop theoretical ideas about the realities of organizational adaptation. That effort has been directed toward understanding the ways in which populations of organizations and individual organizations change (not necessarily intentionally) over time in response to adaptive pressures (Aldrich 1979; Cohen and Sproull 1996; Nooteboom 2000; Dierkes et al. 2001; Greve 2003; Aldrich and Ruef 2006; Dosi and Marengo 2007). Studies of the birth and death processes of organizational life and the resulting features of organizational demography have provided important contributions to these efforts (Hannan and Freeman 1989; Carroll and Hannan 2000).

This history of scholarship forms a background for the explorations in the present chapters. The chapters consider the complications involved in learning from experience. Some of these complications reflect well-known human informationprocessing habits — for example, biases toward conserving belief, simple causalities, historical certainty, and attributions of significance to human intentions. Those characteristics of human behavior are important, but the focus here is primarily on a separate set of the complications that reflect interactions between experience and the processes of learning. As the following chapters will argue, these problems lie primarily not in the learners but in the nature of experience.

体验式学习

追求智慧的手段，反映着人们的认识能力。在某些不太遥远的时空，追求智慧指广泛地使用魔法巫术，以及先知或其他通灵人士的预言或偈语。在古中国、古埃及、古希腊、古罗马，稳重的企业管理者都不会不做占卜就面对生活的不确定性。

现代社会中，尽管还有很多人为求心安进行占卜（Eisenstadt 2006），但是越来越多的人开始运用知识预测未来。就这个方面而言，在现代人的头脑中，没有什么理念像「人类通过体验式学习来掌控生活」那样神圣不可侵犯。为了改变命运，个人和组织试着从经验中学习，有时使用比较基础的方式 —— 简单地复制与成功相连的行动，有时使用比较高级的方式 —— 理清因果关系。个人和组织推崇经验、寻求经验、诠释经验。

当然，从经验中学习并不是人类学习的唯一机制。确实，个人和组织所拥有的知识，大部分不是从日常生活或工作中获取的，而是首先经由专家的系统观察和分析，然后经由权威（例如，书本、网络、老师）的传播，之后经由或直接或间接的实践验证而来的。从广泛意义上说，这些知识可以归为学术知识而不是经验知识（March 2004）。

然而，当代组织文献仍然认为体验式学习是人类适应环境的一种比较重要的方式，是人类提高行动与环境匹配度的一种比较重要的机制（Argyris and Schon 1978；Levit and March 1988；Huber 1991；Payne，Bett-man，andJohnson 1993；Cohen and Sproull 1996；Argote 1999；Nooteboom 2000；Starbuck and Hedberg 2001；Greve 2003）。令人羡慕的组织被描述成「学习型组织」，促进组织学习的顾问比比皆是（Argyris and Schon 1978；Senge 1990）；最近的组织改进建议经常强调从经验中学习（Senge 1990；Olsen and Peters 1996；Dierkes et al. 2001；Zollo and Winter 2002）。

有的学者认为，从经验中学习与理性行动理论（Arrow 1972；Coleman 1990；Milgrom and Robert 1992）有关，从博弈理论（von Neumann and Morgenstem 1944；Luce and Raiffa 1957；Kreps 1990b）和决策理论（Raiffa 1968；Machina 1987；Anand 1993；Augier and March 2002）中可见一斑。有的学者则认为，从经验中学习与规则遵循行动理论（March and Olsen 1989，第 2 章；March 1994，第 2 章）有关，从个人身份和机构身份、社会角色等概念中可见一斑。理性行动理论认为，智慧行动的基础是遵循结果逻辑（March and Olsen 1989，第 1 章；March 1994，第 1 章），规则遵循行动理论关注规则、身份和角色（Scott and Meyer 1983；Ashforth and Mael 1989；North 1990；Becker 2004；Brandstatter，Gigernzer，and Hertwig 2006），认为智慧行动的基础是遵循适当逻辑（Gunther 1993；March and Olsen 2006b）。这两派学者都认为体验式学习是人类智慧的要素。理性行动理论认为，组织通过总结过去来预测未来（Gavetti and Levinthal 2000；Zollo and Winter 2002；Gibbons and Roberts 2008）。规则遵循行动理论认为，组织把经验编码成规则（Alchian 1950；Nelsonand Winter 1982；March，Schulz，and Zhou 2000；Akerlof and Kranton 2005；March and Olsen 2006a）。

这样，人们投入大量精力寻找促进组织从经验中学习的方法。他们开发出复杂的估计工具、建模工具和战略规划工具，帮助商业公司进行营销、财务、生产和人事方面的决策制定，帮助政府机构提高社会服务的效能和效率。他们设计出复杂的问责制度，帮助各种利益相关者控制组织。庞大的咨询行业形成了，传播最佳实务和优秀理论。现代大学纷纷设立管理学院，为私营领域和公共领域培养管理人才。管理教育提供「最佳实务」菜单，以及成套的理论（包括营销理论、政治理论、运营理论和公司理论，等等）。

为了提高与环境的匹配度，组织经常对实务、流程和形式进行变革。诚然，还有另外一种更为简单的方式提高与环境的匹配度 —— 改变环境，各行各业的领头者经常使用这一方式。从这个角度来看，适应是弱者的事情，强者制定游戏规则，让别人适应自己。在一定程度上，历史上的伟大国家（古罗马、古中国、奥斯曼、西班牙、大不列颠、苏联、美国）之所以繁荣昌盛，都是因为强迫环境适应自己，而不是浪费精力努力适应环境。对于伟大的企业帝国（美国钢铁、通用汽车、壳牌、联合利华、索尼、IBM、微软）而言，情况也是如此。人类亦然。正如所有例子表明的那样，长远来看，通过改变环境来提高与环境的匹配度会带来一个不良后果 —— 适应能力的衰退（强者也有必须适应环境的时候）。霸主地位如果丧失了，适应能力就会加速衰退。

人们在寻找促进组织从经验中学习的方法的同时，还在进行大量的实证研究和理论研究，希望形成一套理论，描述现实中的组织是如何适应环境的。这方面的工作直接指向理解组织群和个体组织是如何在适应压力之下随着时间而改变的（不一定是有意地改变）（Aldrich 1979；Cohen and Sproull 1996；Nooteboom 2000；Dierkes et al. 2001；Greve 2003；Aldrich and Ruef 2006；Dosi and Marengo 2007）。在这个方面，组织生态学研究做出了重要贡献（Hannan and Freeman 1989；Caroll and Hannan 2000）。

以上简要介绍了组织学习的研究历史，目的是为后面章节的讨论打下背景基础。后面的章节将探讨从经验中学习的各种问题，这些问题，有些反映了人类那些著名的信息加工习惯，例如，固守成见、简化因果、寻求确定、妄自尊大。人类行为的那些特性是重要的，但是本书主要关注的是另外一组问题，这组问题反映的是经验和学习的交互作用。正如以下章节将要论证的那样，这组问题主要不在学习者而在经验本身。
