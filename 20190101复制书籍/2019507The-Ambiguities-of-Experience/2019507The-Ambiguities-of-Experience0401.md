4 GENERATING NOVELTY

Although there are numerous unresolved problems, theories of adaptation deal reasonably well with the efficiencies and surprises associated with the processes by which existing ideas, practices, forms, or products survive and reproduce (Cyert and March 1963; March 1988, chap. 8; 1994; 1999a, chap. 15; Nelson and Winter 1982; Hannan and Freeman 1989; Cohen and Sproull 1996; March, Schulz, and Zhou 2000; Hodgkinson and Starbuck 2008). Theories of adaptation typically deal less well with the exploratory processes by which new ideas, forms, products, or practices are created, made available, and protected from premature elimination (Becker, Knudsen, and March 2006). These latter processes and notions about them constitute the rudiments of a theory of novelty and are the focus of this chapter.

Two preliminary caveats may be worth recording. The first is that a theory of novelty deals primarily with global novelty, not local novelty. It focuses on the generation of attributes or practices that are new to a population of organizations, not just new to the organization to which they spread. Theories of the spread of things are essential to understanding organizational innovation and adaptation, but they are somewhat different from theories of the generation of new ideas. In particular, a primary feature of local innovativeness is the base level of ignorance in the innovator. To a novice lover, all techniques of lovemaking are exciting discoveries, regardless of their familiarity to others. Likewise, an experienced scholar is less inclined to claim originality than is a beginner.

The second caveat is that studies of novelty and creativity are sometimes confused by a tendency to conflate the two. Novelty is deviation from established procedures or knowledge; creativity is novelty that is subsequently judged successful. Novelty is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for creativity. Thus, many of the individual and social attributes that lead to novelty will also lead to creativity, but the complications of identifying the social and competitive processes by which novelty is confirmed as creativity are ignored by a theory of novelty.

In addition, this chapter treats two assumptions as more or less self-evident. The first is that most novel ideas are bad ones — that is, they will subsequently be judged unsuccessful. Only a small, unpredictable fraction of novel initiatives will turn out to be successful. The second assumption is that when novel ideas are generated, there is no reliable way to anticipate which of them will be successful. The few novel ideas that will prove to be creative are indistinguishable from those that will not until considerable time has passed. These two properties of novelty are critical to understanding the problems with novelty.

ADAPTATION AS AN ENEMY OF NOVELTY

The proposition that humans conserve beliefs and practices and thus are hostile to novelty is well known to the study of social psychology (Lord, Ross, and Lepper 1979; Nickerson 1998). It is also characteristic of learning from experience. As we observed in chapter 2, new rules, routines, forms, and ideas are disadvantaged by the way the replication of success leads to increasing stability in choice. This is partly because novel things have properties that place them at risk. Their outcome distributions tend to have low means and high variances; they often require practice; their returns are often delayed in time and are often global rather than local. It is also partly because the replication of success tends to find a satisfactory (possibly because of chance) alternative and stick with it, particularly if alternatives require practice in order to realize their potential. The replication of success reduces the likelihood of throwing good money after bad, but it also means that good alternatives with poor initial results will be permanently passed over.

Similarly, as pointed out in chapter 3, learning through the construction of stories and models is implicitly hostile to novelty. Stories and models are created out of familiar elements linked together in familiar ways. The familiarity and flexibility of story and model frames make them endure and thereby provide a barrier to new experience or new frames. New things are not experienced because they are coded into narratives and models that preserve existing frames and thereby, in an important sense, do not occur as episodes from which new lessons can be learned. The proposition that there is nothing new under the sun is a proposition as much about the stories that are told and the models that are created as it is about the reality they purport to understand. The construction of stories and models of experience out of familiar themes assures that the lessons of experience will be easily understood and readily assimilated, but it also inhibits new themes and new interpretations. The novelty that will endure is primarily novelty that can be assimilated into old stories and models, which tends to exclude extremely deviant items (March 1992).

Because of these features of adaptation to experience, one of the more common themes of research on adaptation and of the literatures on technological, organizational, or intellectual change is the notion that novelty is not favored by adaptive processes (Garud, Nayyar, and Shapira 1997; Van de Ven 1999). New, deviant ideas are likely to be bad ones (Simonton 1995, 1999; Sutton 2002), and any general inclination to invent and reproduce new ideas is likely to lead to disaster. Moreover, even good new ideas are likely to lead to unfavorable results in the near temporal and spatial distance and thus are unlikely to endure long enough to exhibit their potential value.

Processes that produce actions having a large number of negative outcomes and only a small number of positive ones, most of which are delayed considerably or realized at a distance from the locus of adaptation, are prime candidates for elimination by adaptive processes, even though their expected value may qualify them for survival (Denrell and March 2001; Denrell 2007). In part, this is because adaptive processes, as we normally observe and model them, are myopic. They are relatively insensitive to outcomes that are separated in time or space from the locus of adaptation (Levinthal and March 1993; Levinthal and Posen 2008). This feature of adaptation underlies problems of delayed gratification (self-control) and distant gratification (altruism). It also underlies problems with novelty.

The tendency toward eliminating variability is strengthened by diffusion from others. An important mechanism for the replication of successful practices, routines, and forms is the spread of rules through a connected population (Strang and Soule 1998). Imitation leads to homogenization of practices across individuals and organizations that are connected in such a way that their attributes are visible (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Djelic 1998). Diffusion of practices among connected organizations is limited by well-known difficulties of reproducing routines (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996, 2005), but it results in considerable convergence and the reduction of variation, particularly where the likelihood of imitating an attribute is increased by the number of organizations exhibiting the attribute (Singh, Tucker, and House 1986; Carroll and Hannan 1989; Hannan 1998).

In short, exploitation drives out exploration (March and Simon 1958, 185; Holland 1975; March 1999c, chap. 7). It seems likely that a theory of novelty will have to provide an understanding of how processes that generate novelty and heterogeneity can survive in the face of processes of refinement and imitation that seem likely to eliminate novelty and its progenitors if they themselves are to survive (Van de Ven 1999; Nooteboom 2000).

THE NOVELTY PUZZLE

Novelty is vulnerable to adaptive processes. Yet new ideas and changes stemming from them, as well as heterogeneity in routines, practices, and forms, are conspicuous aspects of modern organizational experience. Although students of organizations often portray organizations as resistant to novelty and prone to mimetic homogeneity, a comparison of almost any organization as it functions today with the same organization fifty years ago reveals substantial differences, and contemporaneous heterogeneity among organizations is often considerable (Hoopes and Madsen 2008). Organizations are often difficult to change in any particular desired direction, and the complaints of organizational reformers pursuing a specific reform are, therefore, undoubtedly justified. However, organizational change is frequent (March 1999c, chap. 8), and proposals of organizational change are even more frequent. The babble of proposed change is loud and continuous.

Although not all change involves the introduction of novel ideas, novelty is remarkably common. Deviant behaviors and practices are generated at a significant rate more or less continually. Most novel ideas are quickly and beneficially extinguished, but for some reason, this does not seem to slow the flow of novelty. The ultimate destiny of an evolving human species in an evolving universe may, in some sense, be a novelty-free existence, but adaptive processes seem likely to eliminate the species long before they eliminate novelty. Novelty appears in many respects to be irrepressible.

The failure of adaptive processes to eliminate foolishness, curiosity, deviance, and the processes of novelty is a puzzle. How do the mechanisms of novelty generation — whatever they may be — survive and reproduce (Dosi 1988; Dosi, Marengo, Bassanini, and Valente 1999; Gigerenzer 2000; Olsen 2009)? If most novel practices, products, or ideas diminish the chances of success — as seems almost axiomatic — what sustains mechanisms of novelty?

One might imagine that mechanisms of novelty survive despite their poor short-run and nearby returns by virtue of their more distant adaptive usefulness. One version of such an imagination is the speculation that the human organism is hardwired to foster novelty through a curiosity drive or other similar attribute that has evolved over thousands of generations. Such a speculation is, however, more a proclamation of faith than a certifiable phenomenon, and students of adaptive processes are generally reluctant to assume adaptive magic without understanding the specific way in which it has been accomplished.

It is possible to specify situations in which attributes that are locally suboptimal but more useful in the long run or over a broader perspective survive over time; but it is also possible to specify environments in which attributes essential to long-run survival, such as novelty or diversity, make survival in the short run difficult or impossible, and attributes that permit short-run survival are deleterious in the long run. There is no necessary solution to the problem of meeting both nearby and more distant survival requirements, and the precise mechanisms involved have to be identified.

The problem is complicated by the undoubted role of exploitative knowledge in the development and execution of novel ideas. Many studies of creativity identify the creative tension between processes of imagination and processes of execution, recognizing the extent to which the foolishness of exploration has to be juxtaposed to the discipline of exploitation. Either alone is not enough. It is usually argued, however, that the relation has to evolve in such a way that the ratio of imagination to the discipline of conventional knowledge is high relatively early in any particular project and declines over time. The usual concern is that the ratio tends to decline more rapidly than is desirable and thus that novel ideas are normalized too quickly.

TWO THEORETICAL TRACKS FOR UNDERSTANDING NOVELTY

Novelty is a conspicuous feature of organization life, so any simple idea that the adaptive efficiencies coded into knowledge and adaptive processes are homogeneously inimical to the generation of novelty or the reproduction of novelty-generating mechanisms is probably incomplete. In attempting to understand the survival of novelty in the face of adaptive mechanisms that seem likely to extinguish it, students of adaptation have developed theories of novelty along two main tracks, each of which offers insight but neither of which has led to a strikingly satisfactory resolution.

Adaptive Combinations

The first track postulates some kind of process by which new elements are produced from combinations of established old ones. The classic example in evolutionary biology is sexual reproduction and the genetic combinations that it produces. The classic example in organizational studies is the transfer of rules, routines, or practices from one location to another and the transformations that they experience as they combine with existing rules, routines, and practices within the receiving organization (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996, 2005; Zbaracki 1998). The search for a theory of the combinatorics of organizational routines has occupied many good people for many years. Progenitors of the ideas are found in economics (Schumpeter 1934), psychology (Hebb 1949), and political science (Deutsch 1963).

The combinatoric tradition has numerous contemporary contributors (Padgett and Ansell 1983; Feldman 1989, 2000; Pentland and Rueter 1994; Romer 1994; Pentland 1995; Cohen and Sproull 1996; Czarniawska and Joerges 1996; Weitzman 1998; Gilboa and Schmeidler 2001; Feldman and Pentland 2003; Nooteboom 2000; Padgett, Lee, and Collier 2003; Gavetti, Levinthal, and Rivkin 2005; Obstfeld 2005; Padgett and McLean 2006; Becker, Knudsen, and March 2006; Gavetti and Warglien 2007; Page 2007; Svejenova, Mazza, and Planellas 2007; Nooteboom and Stam 2008).

The hunt for analogues has wandered from Mendel to linguistics to literary theory to haute cuisine to chemistry to neural networks with inconclusive but instructive results. The classic problems, particularly in theories of organizational novelty, are specifying precisely the basic elements involved, the laws of combination, and the ways in which those laws have evolved. Although elements of such a theory have been sketched in interesting ways, none of these problems has been solved in a way that is totally satisfactory. Nothing analogous to Mendelian laws exists for the theory of combinatoric novelty in organizations.

Adaptive Inefficiency

The second track of theories of novelty proceeds from the implicit assumption that processes of adaptation eliminate sources of error but are inefficient in doing so. Casual observations of human life suggest that existing mechanisms of adaptation are far from perfect. The modern social order is an impressively effective system of social control, but it is persistently subject to the contradictions of deviant actors, not all of whom spend years in prisons or asylums. Markets, particularly financial markets, enforce many elements of efficient adaptation, but they leave ample room for wonder at their inefficiencies. Successful gambling casinos and lotteries are monuments to human capabilities to make investment choices that reduce their prospects for wealth accumulation.

The propensity of managers in organizations to be similarly inattentive both to what is known and to evidence about what might come to be known is legendary (Pfeffer and Sutton 2006; Gary, Dosi, and Lovallo 2008), as is the failure of organizations to adopt practices reputed to have led to successes elsewhere. A common interpretation of such elements of apparent maladaptation emphasizes the relatively slow character of adaptive processes relative to the rate of change of the environments they encounter, but such an explanation suffers from the flexibility in estimating the rates of change that it allows.

At least at first blush, it appears that novelty survives not because it offers selective advantage within specifiable adaptive mechanisms but because those mechanisms are actually quite inefficient instruments of improvement and thus inefficient in eliminating the instruments of novelty. They move slowly, and they make mistakes. They have difficulty achieving unity and coherence. As a result, organizations exhibit a rich mixture of continuity and change (Olsen 2009). For example, in an organizational setting, personnel retention procedures that retain apparently successful managers and dismiss apparently unsuccessful managers seem prima facie to be useful in improving the fit of an organization to its environment; yet they can systematically retain less competent managers and dismiss the more competent, thus both tolerating foolish novelty and reducing the long-run fit (March and March 1977; Levinthal 1991; Denrell and Fang 2007).

Generic Labels

One conventional approach to talking about adaptive inefficiency is to provide a generic label for inexplicable deviations: stupidity? madness? revelation? genius? perversity? irreducible noise? The obvious analogue is the concept of mutation, a label for inexplicable deviations in genetic reproduction. Providing such labels is not an entirely foolish solution. Most natural processes or understandings of them exhibit inexplicable variation, and almost every domain of knowledge has labels for its unexplained variance: personality, power, leadership, culture. Since in social science generally, as in theories of adaptation, the unexplained variance is large, the concepts specified by such labels account for a great deal without explaining it (Lave and March 1975).

Such labeling is a kind of intellectual last resort that can be justified primarily by the extent to which it stimulates scholarship that reduces the use of the label. For example, some years ago, the label of「risk preference」was introduced into choice theory as a generic label for observed nonlinearities in the revealed human utility for money over alternative gambles and thus for unexplained deviations from predicted behavior. This led to considerable effort to unpack the nonlinearities, an effort that has sometimes been confused by the label but that has, on balance, probably been fruitful (March and Shapira 1987, 1992; March 1999c, chap. 15; Denrell 2007, 2008).

THE SURVIVAL OF MECHANISMS OF NOVELTY

An alternative to providing a catchall label for instances of novelty is to try to identify specific processes that generate unavoidable but predictable mistakes of adaptation. For example, we can imagine a theory of knowledge decay. Knowledge can be assumed to be accumulated through adaptation and stored in libraries, genes, rules, and memories. Knowledge is lost through turnover, forgetting, and misfiling, which assure that at any point there is considerable ignorance. Something that was once known is no longer known. In addition, knowledge is lost through its incomplete accessibility. Something that is known at one place is unknown at another (Jeppesen and Lakhani 2009).

Ignorance, whether from lags in adaptation, from decay, or from failure to access distributed knowledge, ordinarily is more likely to produce disaster than useful discovery; but sometimes it can generate the latter (Polanyi 1963). It is one of the reasons to be cautious in seeking to produce fully integrated, efficient systems of knowledge (Burt 1987). Betterarticulated theories both of knowledge decay and of the peculiarities of access to distributed knowledge would almost certainly contribute to a better understanding of organizational novelty.

Novelty as Deviance

A conspicuous feature of novelty is that it deviates from received knowledge or norms, and a more general theory of deviance from conventionality might, therefore, illuminate a theory of novelty (Amabile 1983; Wells et al. 2006). One variant of a theory of deviance highlights the speculation that the deviants of creativity may share important attributes with the deviants from sanity and social norms. By this presumption, the correlates of genius will overlap considerably the correlates of delinquency. As a result, insofar as it focuses on individual-level explanations, a theory of novelty is likely to share many features with a theory of deviance. It is tempting to assume that creativity (i.e., novelty that turns out to change things) is simply a random draw from the universe of foolishness and thus that the primary nonrandom determinants of individual creativity are the determinants of deviance.

At least since Durkheim (1973), sociological theories of deviance have emphasized the way in which deviance is generated not by individual-level processes but by features of society. The strong association of criminal deviation with gender, race, and age attributes of individuals is pictured as stemming from properties of social structure: deviance stems from disassociation from well-integrated social institutions and norms. Alienation or separation from social institutions is created and sustained by the development of cultures of opposition and membership in deviant social groups (Becker 1963; Spergel 1964), by cultural typing (Said 1978), and by learning (Bandura 1977). Just as the innovative deviance of the juvenile delinquent (Becker 1984) is shaped by an imperfect relation with social institutions, norms, and instruments of control, so also perhaps is the innovative deviance of the entrepreneurial capitalist.

In order for a theory of deviance to contribute to a theory of novelty, however, it needs to explain how deviance fits into an adaptive system, how the inefficiencies of adaptation are inherent in its capabilities for producing successes. This is one way of perceiving the combinatorics of sexual reproduction among animals, or the combinatorics of the spread of ideas through a population of firms. Sexual reproduction generally produces combinations of genes that will be favored by the environment, but it also sometimes produces combinations that are exceptionally deviant. Most of these will fail miserably, but some small fraction will turn out to have attributes that are unusually favorable.

In an analogous fashion, the imitation of successful practices generally results in improved chances of survival, but it also can result in transformations that are exceptionally deviant. Again, most of these will fail miserably, but some small fraction will turn out to have attributes that are unusually favorable (Zbaracki 1998; Czarniawska and Sevón 2005). Similar things can be said about random interdisciplinary or cross-cultural interaction (March 2008, chap. 13). By embedding them in processes of efficient reproduction of favorable traits, selective adaptation preserves mechanisms for producing foolish novelty.

Adaptive Generation of Conditions for Novelty in Organizations

Three ways in which effective adaptation in organizations creates conditions favorable to novelty generation, even though the return from such novelty may be negative, are well known in organizational studies (for a further discussion, see Miner, Haunschild, and Schwab 2003). The first is the way in which success leads to organizational slack and its associated reduction in control, which in turn yields experimentation and avoidance of the infant mortality of ideas (Cyert and March 1963; Nohria and Gulati 1996; Greve 2003). Among start-up firms, excess capital resources provide slack buffers that limit the infant mortality of novel ideas (Levinthal 1991). In effect, substantial success, either in performance or in soliciting early support, absorbs the negative effects of failure and reduces the close monitoring of idea initiatives. These slack buffers reflect uncommitted resources (Deutsch 1963) that facilitate the extended pursuit of untested ideas, some small fraction of which may turn out to be exceptionally good ones (Winter 1971). Slack is produced by efficiency, but it serves to protect foolishness from elimination. Novelty (which is likely to be mostly foolish) is a side consequence of slack, which is a side consequence of effective adaptation.

A second phenomenon of organizational adaptation that contributes to novelty is managerial hubris. Adaptive mechanisms retain successful managers at a higher rate than unsuccessful ones. A history of success leads managers to a systematic overestimation of the prospects for success in novel endeavors. If managers attribute their successes to talent when they are, in fact, a joint consequence of talent and good fortune, successful managers will come to believe that they have capabilities for beating the odds in the future as they apparently have had in the past. This hubris on the part of managers will lead them (and thereby their organizations) to be more supportive of novel risky ideas than the ideas warrant (March and Shapira 1987; Kahneman and Lovallo 1993). Novelty is a side consequence of managerial hubris about risk, which is a side consequence of adaptive managerial selection.

A third organizational feature contributing to novelty comes from the way competition among alternatives within or among organizations leads to overly optimistic hopes for novel ideas. In a competitive world of promises, winning projects are systematically projects in which hopes exceed reality (Wilson 1977; Harrison and March 1984; Thaler 1988). Novel ideas, by virtue of the lack of reliable knowledge about them, profit particularly from this tendency toward overoptimism. Competitive selection based on expectations for the future favors optimistic biases, which favor novelty because the uncertainty surrounding new things makes them more open to the enthusiasms of optimistic fantasy. A key U.S. government official involved in funding spy satellite systems noted that sixteen of the eighteen government space programs opened to competitive bidding between 1977 and 2002 were awarded to new players. He explained this as stemming from some combination of naiveté and guile:「You as the incumbent are probably going to write a realistic proposal because you know what’s involved and propose pretty much what you’ve been doing, since it has been successful. Your competitor, out of ignorance or guile, is going to write a more imaginative, creative proposal for which there is almost no backing」(Taubman 2007).

The mechanisms underlying organizational slack, managerial hubris, and competitive optimism are all instruments of adaptive effectiveness. They reflect and support success, but at the same time they contribute to novelty in organizations even though novelty is, on average, a bad idea. These apparent paradoxes lead to the speculation that there may be other ways in which adaptive processes help to sustain, rather than eliminate, novelty-generating mechanisms.

Consider, for example, the ways in which intelligence and knowledge are implicated in the reproductive errors of adaptation (March 2008, chap. 8). On the one hand, intelligence and knowledge generally seem more likely to eliminate novelty than to sustain it. Substantially novel ideas, routines, and properties are likely to deviate from established practices and knowledge. They will generally be identified as inferior to existing practice by conventional intelligence. In the overwhelming majority of cases, rejection of new ideas by the application of intelligence proves to be sensible. The result is the reinforcement of the use of intelligence and knowledge in taking action, as well as in assessing novel practices. Predilections for using knowledge and intelligence are learned from good experience with them. Since they (correctly) identify most novel ideas as inferior, knowledge and intelligence are often portrayed both as major engines of competitive advantage, change, and economic growth (Winter 1987; Hatchuel and Weil 1995; Loasby, 1999) and as major inhibitors of creativity (Simonton 1999; March 2008, chap. 8).

However, there is another side to intelligence, what might be called utopian intelligence. Enthusiasm for rational intelligence leads to enthusiasm for ideas generated from abstract thinking and models, stimulates faith in the fit of hypothetical models to real situations, and encourages confidence in novel alternatives generated by abstract thinking. This kind of utopian intelligence appears to be a major source of novel ideas and to have produced well-documented cases of significant change. As might be expected, however, most such novel inventions end in disaster, as they have generally in the history of utopian idealists. Consider, for example, the role of utopian intelligence in the central planning of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites, the American adventure in Vietnam, and the burst bubble of Long-Term Capital Management.

With such a record of disasters, even the crudest kind of adaptive process might be expected to extinguish the use of utopian intelligence. How does it happen, then, that utopian intelligence is reproduced in human communities? A possible answer (borrowed from population biology) is the idea of hitchhiking (Hedrick 1982). A property that is neutral or harmful survives by virtue of its linkage to a selectively advantageous property. An attribute (utopian intelligence) that almost always fails hitchhikes on an attribute (routine intelligence) that is frequently and manifestly successful.

The notion that mechanisms of novelty generation survive by hitchhiking on mechanisms of routine efficiency has appeal as an interpretation of one way in which an adaptive process might sustain novelty, but it leaves the conditions for hitchhiking unexplained. What links utopian intelligence with routine intelligence so that the hitchhiking occurs? The obvious (but not particularly helpful) answer is that the two elements of intelligence are linked cognitively and socially to such a degree that they cannot easily be unbundled. They share so many basic elements that an adaptive advantage of one necessarily results in an adaptive advantage for the other. For example, the two elements of intelligence are deeply intertwined in education so that success using one is highly correlated with success using another.

Hitchhiking as used in such an explication, however, is little more than an arm-wave reminder of adaptive inefficiencies. The intuitive idea is that mechanisms of adaptation create a dynamic of novelty that, despite its propensity to disaster, is shielded from elimination by the adaptive process itself. Developing that intuitive idea into something more precise requires a close empirical look at cases of novelty generation from the point of view of understanding how they survive their errors. The hitchhiking relation between routine intelligence and utopian intelligence provides a minimal specification of the mechanism, but it is only slightly less mysterious than the intuitive idea itself.

What other linkages exist that bundle organizational attributes so that it is difficult to separate their adaptive fates? An obvious feature of historical causality is its complexity. As the causal complexity of the bundling of organizational attributes increases, the amount of adaptive experience required to guarantee that adaptive processes will reliably reproduce only superior attributes becomes much larger than organizational experience can be expected to be. Under such conditions, novelty becomes not so much an anomaly of adaptation as a product of it, and a theory of novelty becomes a theory of the mechanisms of inherent adaptive inefficiency.

The problem is to move from a general proposition that the causal complexity of history sustains instruments of adaptive inefficiency from which elements of novelty arise to a more precise specification of individual mechanisms. Such a move will probably require two interrelated things. The first is empirical — an intense multiobservation focus over some time, a strategy that is probably more akin to the story of Mendelian research than to the story of Schumpeterian imagination. The second is theoretical — the development of a handful of precise ideas that clarify the phenomena that have been observed. Neither can proceed very far without the other, but it is particularly difficult to choose among quite different theoretical analogues without a precise linkage with empirical observations. For example, an argument that organizational development is akin to language development is prima facie reasonable, but it cannot really be assessed relative to arguments that organizational development is analogous to species development or chemical bonding without both precise specifications and careful comparisons of the alternatives with multiple empirical cases.

THE ENGINEERING OF NOVELTY

Organizational and social engineers seek ideas about possible organization forms or governmental procedures that might affect the rate of novelty or the success rate of novelty (Nooteboom and Stam 2008). One obvious possibility that has attracted considerable effort is to find early ways to distinguish the rare novel idea that will prove very successful from the numerous novel ideas that will be unsuccessful, even disastrous. The evidence does not support great optimism on this score, particularly with respect to extremely deviant ideas. New ideas that subsequently have changed knowledge considerably have usually been disparaged initially (Aronson 1977; David 1991). Strategies for distinguishing creativity from foolishness ordinarily impose criteria of conventionality that are more likely to reduce novelty than to purify it usefully. As Marc Andreessen, one of the founders of Netscape, said in an interview (Levy 2003),「Fundamental change comes out of left field. It has to be an idea that’s viewed as crazy at the time. If any idea looks like a good idea, there are lots of big companies out there like Microsoft that would already be doing it」(E10).

A more promising alternative is to seek ways to minimize the costs of experimenting with new ideas while retaining the benefits of successful ones (Romano 2002; Holahan, Weil, and Wiener 2003). Organizational engineering seeks forms of organizational foolishness that are protected enough to generate modest amounts of novelty without being so favored as to swamp an organization with novel, but inferior, possibilities. However, devising structures or procedures that protect an organization from the costs of deviance without also inhibiting the recognition and implementation of the occasional good idea is not easy (Cohen and Levinthal 1989, 1990). A classic solution is to limit the「bet size」of investments in novelty. The idea is to differentiate among novel ideas by smallscale experiments and to recoup the costs (including the losses associated with bad ideas) by subsequently increasing the investments in successful projects (Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; McGrath 1999).

The strategy of limiting exploratory bet size has achieved a certain amount of popularity (Sitkin 1992; Bowman and Hurry 1993); it has also generated a certain amount of skepticism (Adner and Levinthal 2004). There are obvious difficulties involved in scaling up from small experiments to large programs, but where that is possible, the strategy seems potentially feasible. It is, for example, one view of the plethora of entrepreneurial start-ups found during the heyday of Silicon Valley experimentation. Not by intentional design but primarily by happenstance, the high-tech community stumbled on a financial structure that, at least in the short run, seemed to separate the impact of the costs of experimentation from the realization of its benefits and allowed investors in the occasional spectacular success to bear the fruits of that success without fully paying the costs of the large number of failures.

Another set of strategies involves partitioning an organization into diverse subgroups. For example, a standard idea in discussions of combinatorics as a source of novelty is the advantage of diversity in routines for producing instances of advantageous novelty through high-variance combinations of them (Mayr 1982; Potvin, Kraenzel, and Seutin 2001; Page 2007). Diversity in organizations tends to be reduced by the homogenizing tendencies of adaptation (BeecherMonas 2007), but it is maintained by boundaries that create what Nooteboom (2000) describes as「secluded niches.」Permeable boundaries and the parochialism they stimulate encourage homogenization within their limits but diversity across them. As a result, they can sustain both diversity and adequate contact to allow useful combinations (Krackhardt and Kilduff 1990; Oberoi 1994; March 2008, chap. 13).

The organizational problem is to maintain parochialism among subunits sufficient to sustain multiple disciplined knowledge systems but with cross-unit contact sufficient to share ideas and practices (Burt 1987; Galunic and Rodan 1998; Rodan and Galunic 2004; Fang, Lee, and Schilling, 2009). The optimum level of segregation is difficult to specify, involving as it does difficult trade-offs across space and time (March 1994, chap. 6). Any solution to this problem has to be sensitive to the technology and organization of contact, as is evidenced by contemporary discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of changing capabilities to access distributed knowledge (Powell, Koput, and SmithDoerr 1996; Rodan 2008).

Early experiments in strengthening links among disparate knowledge bases have led to remarkable discoveries of ideas and practices that have developed in previously isolated domains ( Jeppesen and Lakhani 2009). It seems possible, however, that a side consequence of improving knowledge diffusion might be to introduce elements of homogenization that limit the decentralized pursuit of unlikely ideas. The history of organizational cycling between centralization and decentralization is a tribute, in part, to the engineering difficulty of finding an enduring balance between the short-run and local costs and the long-run and more global benefits of boundaries.
