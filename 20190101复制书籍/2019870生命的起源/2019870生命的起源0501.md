"Then after that came us — stage six. That's the end of the Darwinian era, when cultural evolution replaces biological evolution as the main driving force. "Cultural" means that the big changes in living conditions are driven by humans spreading their technology and their ways of making a living, by learning from one another rather than breeding."

— Freeman Dyson, Eastover Farm 

Several weeks ago the Lonsdale prize went to researchers who think first life was RNA, a replicating creature. So I rang up Freeman Dyson, emeritus professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, to see if he still embraces the idea that original life was a "garbage bag world," a membranous creature with dirty water trapped inside that reproduced for a billion years or more with high rates of error before replicating.

Dyson does the math on this in his book, Origins of Life (2nd. ed.), based on Alexander Oparin's  cell-first theory of metabolism.  Dyson calls it his "toy boat model," calculated with pencil and paper, where thousands of molecular units make the leap from disorder to order with "reasonable probability."

During our phone conversation, Dyson told me that he does indeed still hold to his hypothesis and also still thinks RNA was a byproduct of that first creature's own metabolism, emerging as a parasite and eventual symbiotic partner. He says it doesn't make sense that original life copied itself without getting its act together first.

In his Origins book, Dyson also refers to Doron Lancet's work on defining metabolism, also based on Oparin's model, by computer simulations of origin of life, saying:

"Doron Lancet has tackled this problem by studying computer models of the evolution of molecular populations, which he calls replicative-homeostatic early assemblies (RHEA). In these models, metabolism is defined in a general way as the evolution of a population in which some of the molecules catalyze the synthesis of others. He finds conditions under which populations can evolve to a high and self-sustaining level of catalytic organization."

This prompted me to call Doron Lancet, a professor at Weizmann Institute, to see what his current thinking is. I reached Lancet at a conference in Stockholm. He had this to say about Freeman Dyson:

"He was my first inspiration. A chapter in his book, Infinite in All Directions, made me realize in the early 1990s that DNA/RNA was not necessarily the holy grail, and that there was an alternative in the form of molecular assemblies composed of mutually interacting simple molecules. The "Lipid World" model as a viable alternative to the "RNA World" would not have come to be without him."

Dyson envisions seven stages of life: (1) garbage bag stage — metabolism without replication; (2) parasite emerges from garbage bag creature, parasite can replicate but not metabolize — "zooms around" cells as viruses in packages; (3) collaboration of metabolic and parasitic creatures, RNA invention of "most mysterious" ribosome; (4) coupling of metabolic and RNA worlds (modern cell), two billion years of speciation and sex, beginning of Darwinian era; (5) multicellular organisms; (6) "us" and end of Darwinian era with cultural evolution replacing biological evolution; (7) whatever happens next.

Freeman Dyson describes himself professionally as a mathematician. He is recognized as one of the architects of quantum electrodynamics as well as one of the most provocative public intellectuals. As a scientist he has not needed a PhD, his BA in math from Cambridge has been more than enough. He now holds 21 honorary degrees.

Dyson's ability to find music in problems may reflect on his father having been a composer. As the story goes, as a teenager he, young Freeman, dealt with the challenge of reading Vinogradov's An introduction to the theory of numbers by learning Russian and then translated Vinogradov's text into English.

Freeman Dyson is a Fellow of the Royal Society, National Academy of Sciences, and Paris Academy of Sciences, and the receipient of numerous awards, among them: Lorentz Medal (Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences); Hughes Medal (Royal Society); Max Plank Medal (German Physical Society); Enrico Fermi Award (US Department of Energy); Lewis Thomas Prize (Scientist as Poet, 1996), Templeton Prize (2000).

Dyson's books include: Disturbing the Universe, Weapons and Hope, Origins of Life, Infinite in all Directions, From Eros to Gaia, Imagined Worlds; The Sun, the Genome and the Internet, A Many Colored Glass: Reflections of Life in the Universe.

Aside from his affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study, he serves on the board of trustees and is a past president of the Space Studies Institute, founded by the late Gerard O'Neill.

Dyson is also a member of Jason, a defense advisory group of scientists.

My interview with Freeman Dyson follows.

Suzan Mazur: Has your thinking about origin of life changed significantly since the second edition of your book Origins of Life 13 years ago? And do you still say everyone is equally ignorant about origin of life?

Freeman Dyson: Yes, I would still say that. We've learned a certain amount since then but the basic mystery remains. We don't have a clearly defined chemical path from a mixture of garbage to an organized cell. That's what we somehow have to discover. The main difference between my thinking about things then and now is that now we firmly understand that there was an RNA world. The evidence for the preponderance of RNA at some stage has become stronger. And, of course, we know about various kinds of RNA operating in living cells today.

Suzan Mazur: Is your hypothesis still that the original living creatures were cells with a metabolic apparatus but without a genetic apparatus — this was not an RNA world — and that cells reproduced with high rates of error for perhaps at least a billion or more years before they began replicating? And that the replicator was a parasite. You say in your book that by metabolism you mean "what the Germans mean by Stoffwechsel with no restriction to genetically directed processes."

Freeman Dyson: Yes, I would still say that there must have been a purely metabolic phase. My thinking is that there were three origins: the original metabolic life, followed by parasitic RNA life, and then finally protein life. There is evidence now that RNA, the replicating stage, probably started a little earlier.

Suzan Mazur: In your book you have a section on Oparin's theory of cells first, enzymes second and genes third. And of Doron Lancet's work, a proponent of Oparin's theory. Do you continue to be keen on Lancet's "Lipid World" regarding origin of life? And if so, why?

Freeman Dyson: Yes, although I don't know what Doron's been doing recently.

Suzan Mazur: You describe Lancet's idea in your book by saying, "Life began with little bags, the precursors of cells, enclosing small volumes of dirty water containing miscellaneous garbage." Can you say more?

Freeman Dyson: Yes, that certainly I would agree with. Certainly lipids are the most likely candidates. It would be the first stage of developing life. These little bags which gradually become cells. I would say that still looks very plausible. But I don't know what further research Doron has done in the last 10 years.

[Note: Doron Lancet has emailed me saying: "Freeman Dyson's mention of my work relates to our basic idea that life began with much smaller and simpler molecules than RNA. . . . Dyson was attracted to this idea (which he jokingly, but lovingly called the garbage bag model) because it constituted a quantitative, physicochemically rigorous model for self-replicating entities that could jump-start life without resorting to long templating biopolymers such as RNA. . . .

What is so nice about such spontaneously accreting building blocks is that (1) they can be simpler than nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA, e.g., fatty acids (simple lipids) found in meteorites as per Dave Deamer's papers and (2) they come in thousands of different kinds, allowing the assembly to be "interesting" compositionally and chemically, hence jump-start more complex subsequent chemistries, including the formation of simple polymer chains, as claimed by both Dyson and Deamer [Deamer was on sabbatical in Lancet's lab 10 years ago.]. . . ."

In short, we claim (as Dyson and Deamer do) that RNA is a result, a consequence of simpler chemistry, not a necessary early "moving force". What is good about our model is that it is not hand-waving. We simulate in the computer accurate chemical progressions that mimic the process described for the appearance of RNA-like templating molecules."]

Suzan Mazur: What do you think of the Lonsdale origin of life prize going to RNA World proponents John Sutherland and Matthew Powner? The search was for a proposal that identified life as "a self-sustaining chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution."

Freeman Dyson: I think I would not make any comment about that. I don't know anything about the details.

[Note: Doron Lancet says further: "RNA World and Lipid World are considered by many as competing models for life's origin. John Sutherland partially alleviated some of the most bitter criticisms against the RNA World by showing that the small molecular building blocks of the RNA chain may be formed prebiotically. This is still far from saying it wins as a full-fledged model for the origin of life. . . . There are many open questions that continue to be debated in the field regarding formation of chains, the capacity of such chains to replicate and more."]

Suzan Mazur: So you still think it was metabolic and cell first. 

Freeman Dyson: Yes, the RNA world was clearly a stage, but I would call that stage 2 not stage 1.

Suzan Mazur: You say the time frame may be a little sooner for the RNA World, how much sooner would you say? 

Freeman Dyson: Completely unknown. We have no idea really how fast things went.

Suzan Mazur: How many camps would you say there are there regarding the origin of life question? 

Freeman Dyson: I haven't really been following all the discussions. 

Suzan Mazur: Are you familiar with the ideas of Adrian Bejan that origin of life is 100% physics and that both  animate and inanimate are live systems, i.e., organized flows of matter and energy? 

Freeman Dyson: I would strongly disagree. It's essentially a problem of chemistry.

Suzan Mazur: Who else's origin of life work on this subject do you like? 

Freeman Dyson: I haven't really been following it, so it's hard to answer. But it obviously is a problem of chemistry, and the chemists have not made much progress as far as I know.

Suzan Mazur: What kind of experiments should they be doing?

Freeman Dyson: Little tiny microdroplets experiments. Chemistry now is getting the tools to do that. Getting accustomed to working with nanograms of material. You want to have experiments with big numbers of little droplets with various mixtures of stuff and seeing what happens.

Suzan Mazur: You draw an analogy in your book between origin of life and the origin of body plans half a billion years ago, a "sudden efflorescence of elaborate body plans," during the Cambrian explosion. Have you had further thoughts about this in light of the "evo-devo revolution"? Did form come first or did form arise from genetic programs? 

Freeman Dyson: I haven't thought about that recently. Clearly we are understanding much more about embryonic development. The thing I'm most excited about is HAR1 and HAR2 discoveries of David Haussler, but of course, that's much later in history.

Suzan Mazur: Do you think form came first?

Freeman Dyson: By the time of the Cambrian explosion it is very late in the history of life and genetics had become very powerful. But, of course, we have no idea what happened in detail.

Suzan Mazur: How soon do you think we'll get to the bottom of things regarding origin of life, i.e., make the breakthrough?

Freeman Dyson: Give it a hundred years, perhaps, but I don't think my prediction is worth anything. It all depends on what nature says, because nature is always surprising us. And probably in this case too.

Suzan Mazur: A hundred years. You think it's going to take that long? 

Freeman Dyson: Well, I would call that short.

Suzan Mazur: You've been criticized for making blasé comments regarding genetic engineering, in light of what we now know about cell dynamics and jumps. Would you comment? 

Freeman Dyson: We are all aware of the dangers. That's nothing new. My feeling is there is no safe path. Trying to put a stop to biology is really not going to remove the dangers. Might as well let it go ahead.  I'm quite aware of the risks in going ahead but the risks in not going ahead are probably just as big.

Suzan Mazur: You've opposed recent wars. Do you ever have regrets about your comments about the atomic bomb and Hiroshima or of having served as a military adviser?

Freeman Dyson: Oh, not at all. I still am a military adviser. I'm very happy with that. The military needs people from the outside to give them advice and to bring them into contact with the outside world.

Suzan Mazur: You're obviously advising them against wars. 

Freeman Dyson: Well they don't ask me when they're starting a war of course. I only advise them about details. We don't expect to be asked whether or not to start a war.

Suzan Mazur: You now consider yourself a natural scientist? 

Freeman Dyson: I'm a mathematician basically. What I do is look around for problems where I can find useful applications for mathematics. All I do really is the math and other people have the ideas.

Suzan Mazur: Would you like to comment further about origin of life? 

Freeman Dyson: I don't think so. I've been interested just now in the Prisoner's Dilemma which is a totally different problem that has to do with the evolution of altruism. A very important problem but nothing to do with origin of life. I just published a piece in the National Academy of Sciences about the Prisoner's Dilemma

Suzan Mazur: I notice in your book that you have a section on Lynn Margulis, who you describe as one of the "illustrious predecessors," particularly for her work on symbiosis, saying that "she set the style" in which you came to think about early evolution. Do you miss her?

Freeman Dyson: Yes. Oh very much, yes. There's another lady who I admire very much — Ursula Goodenough.  Do you know her?

Suzan Mazur: I don't. 

Freeman Dyson: She's also a biologist who does very beautiful things. She's an expert on speciation, the way new species are developed. Anyway I recommend her, she's just about as good as Lynn Margulis.

Suzan Mazur: That's quite an endorsement. I also wanted to ask you about the piece that Richard Lewontin wrote for New York Review of Books in which he said that Charles Darwin intended natural selection as a metaphor, not to be taken literally by generations of scientists. Do you have any comment about that? 

Freeman Dyson: No I didn't know about it at all. It doesn't sound sensible.

垃圾袋世界：戴森谈地球上生命的起源

原文标题：An Interview With Freeman Dyson on the Origins of Life on Earth，作者 Susan Mazu

[An Interview With Freeman Dyson on the Origins of Life on Earth - CounterPunch.org](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/06/27/an-interview-with-freeman-dyson-on-the-origins-of-life-on-earth/)

在那之后出現了我们 一一 第六个阶段。那是达尔文时代的终结，代替生物演替，文化革新成为了主要驱动力。「文化」意味着，通过彼此之间的相互学习而非简单繁殖，人类技术与谋生方式的传播主导了生存条件的巨大改变。

—— 弗里曼·戴森，于 Eastover Farm

几星期之前，郎斯代尔奖（Lonsdale Prize）授予了一些认为最初的生命是不断复制的 RNA 的研究人员。于是我给普林斯顿高等研究院的退休教授弗里曼戴森打电话，想知道他是否仍然坚持自己的观点：「生命起源于一个垃圾袋世界，一个由膜包着一团液体的生物，它在复制前已经以极高的出错率繁殖了十亿年甚至是更久。」

基于亚历山大奥巴林（Alexander Oparin）的细胞第一理论，戴森在他的《生命的起源》（第二版）中做了一道算术题。戴森称之为「玩具模型」，他用铅笔和纸计算，在纸上，成千上万的分子单元以「合理的几率」从无序转化为有序。

戴森在电话采访中告诉我，事实上他仍然坚持自己的假设，认为 RNA 是生物自身新陈代谢的第一个副产物，它首先成为了一种寄生物，而在最后升级成了共生伙伴。在他看来，原始生命还没新陈代谢就开始自我复制，是不合理的。

在他的《生命的起源》一书中，戴森也提到了多伦兰塞特（Doran Lancet）对新陈代谢的定义。这是个同样基于奥巴林模型的定义，它通过电脑模拟了生命起源的过程。

「兰塞特已经通过电脑模型研究分子群体演化解决了这个问题，他称之为复制-自我平衡早期装置（RHEA）。在这些模型中，代谢被定义为群体演替的一个普遍方法，这些群体中，存在一些分子可以催化其他分子的合成。他还发现了可以让种群演替到进行高水平催化活动并能够自发持续下去的某种条件。

这提醒了我联系威兹曼研究院的多伦兰塞特教授，以了解他现在怎么想。在斯德哥尔摩的一次会议上，我联系到了他。兰赛特这样评价戴森：「他给了我最初的灵感。他的著作《全方位的无限》中有一章让我在 90 年代初意识到，DNA 或 RNA 不一定是圣杯，不仅如此，由相互作用的简单分子构成的分子部件之间，还存在着一种形态的转化。要不是他，作为 RNA 模型的可行变形，「脂质世界」的模型不会出现。」

戴森将生命预想为七个阶段：

1、垃圾袋阶段 一一 在这一阶段，这些垃圾袋状的生物可以进行代谢，但并不能复制。

2、垃圾袋生物的体内出现了生物，它们可以复制却无法代谢 一一 此阶段，细胞就像被包住的病毒一样「四处奔波」。

3、寄生物与新陈代谢的合作开始了，「最神秘」的核糖体创造了 RNA。

4、RNA 世界的假说与新陈代谢理论逐密不可分（现代的细胞理论），二十亿年的物种爆发和性分化开启了达尔文时代。

5、多细胞生物阶段来临。

6、随着文化革新代替了生物演替，新的阶段包括了「我们」，以及达尔文时代的终结。

7、 最后一个阶段，也就是未来即将发生的一切。

戴森认真地将自己描述成一名数学家。他是公认的量子电动力学奠基人之一，也是最具争议的公众知识分子之一。作为一名科学家，他从不需要什么博士学位，剑桥大学颁布的数学学士学位就足以说明一切。如今，他享有二十一个荣誉学位。戴森有一项本领，当音乐出错时他能发现，而这也许可以归结为他的父亲曾是一名作曲家的缘故。据传，当还是一名少年时，年轻的弗里曼就开始通过学习俄语，挑战维诺格拉多夫（I. M Vinogradov）的著作《数论导引》，并把它翻译成了英文。

戴森是英国皇家学会会员、美国国家科学院和巴黎科学院院士，同时还是许多奖项的获得者。这些奖项包括：洛伦兹奖（荷兰皇家科学院），伦敦皇家学会休斯奖（英国皇家学会），德国物理学会普朗克奖（德国物理学会），费米奖（美国能源部），刘易斯·托马斯奖（诗人科学家，1996），坦普利顿奖（2000）。

戴森的著作包括：《宇宙波澜》、《武器与希望》、《生命的起源》、《全方位的无限》、《从爱神到盖亚》、《想象中的世界》、《太阳、基因组与互联网》、《一面多彩的镜子：论生命在宇宙中的地位》。

除了是普林斯顿高等硏究院的硏究员，他同时还是董事会成员，美国太空研究学院的前任主席，这个机构由后来的杰拉德·奥尼尔（Gerard O'neil）成立。戴森还是防务科学顾问团 —— 杰森（Jason 集团）一一 的成员。

我与弗里曼·戴森的访谈如下：

马祖尔：自从十三年前（注：1999 年）《生命的起源》的第二版出版后，您对您这本书的看法发生了变化吗？您是否依然认为，大家对生命的起源仍然几乎一无所知？

戴森：是的，我还会那样说。在那以后我们有了一定的了解，但还有一些根本性的谜团没有解开。从垃圾的混合物发展到一个井然有序的细胞，我们还没有清晰地定义这样一条化学途径。从某种程度上来说，那正是我们需要去探索的内容。现在我们确信存在那样的 RNA 世界，我想这就是从前跟现在最大的不同。RNA 在某些阶段占有优势，这样的证据越来越明显。当然，今天的我们已了解了这些 RNA，它们在活细胞内运作，类型很丰富。

马祖尔：请问您的设想仍然是那样吗？最初的生命是含有新陈代谢官能团但不包括基因官能团的细胞 —— 这不是 RNA 世界 一一 而且这些细胞在开始复制之前，已经带着极高的错误率繁殖了大约至少十亿年甚至更久？以及那些复制物是一种寄生生物？在书里您说您所指的新陈代谢就是「德国人所谓的新陈代谢，并不限于由基因指导的过程」。

戴森：对，我还是会说一定存在一个纯粹与分子有关的词。我想有三种起源：原始的分子生命，然后是寄生的 RNA 生命，最后是蛋白质生命。现在有证据表明，RNA 这个可以复制的阶段可能开始得还要更早一些。

马祖尔：在您的书中有一章关于奥巴林的理论，细胞第一，酶第二，基因第三。而多伦兰塞特的工作恰恰支持了奥巴林的理论关于生命起源，您会继续对兰塞特的「脂质世界」感兴趣吗？如果会，又是为什么？

戴森：是的，我会，虽然我并不知道多伦最近在忙什么。

马祖尔：在您的书中，您这样描述兰塞特的想法：「生命从小袋子开始，那是细胞的前身，包含了纷杂垃圾的少量混浊液体即围困在其中。」您能再说得详细一些吗？

戴森：可以，我很乐意。脂质当然是最有可能的备选。那应该是在生命发展的第一个阶段，这些小袋子逐渐变成了细胞。我说的这些看起来仍然十分合情合理，但我不清楚多伦在近十年内作了怎样的进一步研究。

注：兰塞特给我发了封电子邮件说道：

戴森提到了我的工作，这与我们的基本理念有关：生命起始于一些比 RNA 更小、更简单的分子… 戴森被这个想法（他开玩笑地却也很生动地称之为垃圾袋模型）吸引了，因为它为自我复制的实体们构建了一个定量的、兼有物化性质的严密模型，这些实体可以启动生命，却并不依靠 RNA 这类长长的模板生物大分子......

令人高兴的是，关于这些自发增长的构件：1）它们比核苷酸、RNA 的构件要简单，比如，戴夫·迪默（Dave Deamer）的论文中提到的在陨石中发现的脂肪酸（简单的脂质）, 2）它们有上千个不同的种类，这使它们的组装在组成与化学成分上更加有趣，从而可以启动更为复杂的后续化学反应，其中就包括了简单聚合物链的合成，正如戴森和迪默「十年前，迪默正在兰塞特的实验室里度学术假」所声称的那样......

简要来说，我们认为（就像戴森和迪默一样）RNA 是一个结果，是更为简单的化学反应的产物，而非早期必需的驱动力。好在我们的模型并不是敷行了事，我们在计算机上模拟了精准的化学反应进程，这一进程模拟的是类 RNA 模板分子的出现过程。

马祖尔：RNA 世界的支持者约翰·萨瑟兰（John Sutherland）和马修·波纳尔（Matthew Powner）获得了郎斯代尔生命起源奖，您怎么看？这个奖项是为了探寻一个提议从而将生命确定为「一个可自我持续、可经历达尔文进化的化学体系」。

戴森：对此我不作评论。我并不了解这其中的细节。

注：兰塞特进一步说道：「许多人认为关于生命起源，RNA 世界和脂质世界是不断竞争的两个模型。约·萨瑟兰稍稍和了针对 RNA 世界的激烈批评，他表示 RNA 链的小分子构件可能在生命出现之前就已合成。但这距离说它作为一个羽翼丰满的模型胜出了为时尚早…… 关于链的合成和这些链的复制能力等，这一领域仍有许多开放性的问题需要大家继续讨论下去。」

马祖尔：所以您仍然认为生命起源于新陈代谢，而且首先是从细胞开始。

戴森：是的，RNA 世界显然只是其中的一个阶段，但我会称它为第二阶段而不是第一阶段。

马祖尔：您说 RNA 世界出的时间应该略退一些，那您觉得究竟有多退？

戴森：完全未知。我们并不知道事物发展的速度有多快。

马祖尔：关于生命起源这个问题，有多少阵营？

戴森：我没有一直关注这方面的所有讨论。

马祖尔：阿德里安贝扬（Adrian Bejan）有这样一种想法，生命起源完全是物理的，并且不管有无生命都同样属于有活力的系统，也就是物质和能量的有序流动。对此您熟悉吗？

戴森：我表示坚决反对。它必定是化学问题。

马祖尔：关于生命起源这方面的问题，您还对其他哪些人的工作感兴趣？

戴森：我没有一直关注，所以很难回答这个问题。但很显然，这是一个化学问题，就我所知，化学家们还没有太大进展。

马祖尔：他们应当做些什么实验？

戴森：小型的微滴实验。现在已经具备了做这种化学反应的仪器。他们会逐渐习惯与纳克级的物体打交道，用含有混合物的大量微滴做实验，并观察会发生什么。

马祖尔：一个是生命起源，一个是身体形态的起源 —— 五亿年前寒武纪大爆发期间「繁复形态的突然鼎盛」，在二者之间，您做了一个类比推理。根据「演化发育进化论」，您对此有什么更进一步的想法吗？是首先凭空出现了形态还是形态来自于基因过程？

戴森：最近我并没有考虑这个问题。显然我们对胚胎发育了解得更多。最令我感到激动的是大卫·豪斯勒（David Haussler）发现了 HAR1 和 HAR2。不过，当然了，那在历史上已经是很晚的事情了。

马祖尔：您认为形态首先出现吗？

戴森：寒武纪大爆发在生命历史上已经很迟了，基因这个时候已经具有强大的力量。不过，当然了，我们对事情的细节仍然一无所知。

马祖尔：我们要想彻底弄清生命起源，或者换句话来说，取得这方面的重大突破，您认为还需要多久？

戴森：就先给它个一百年吧，也许如此。不过我认为我的预言毫无价值，这完全取于大自然，因为大自然总是给我们惊喜。大概这件事也会一样。

马祖尔：一百年。您认为会花费那么久？戴森：怎么说呢，我觉得那已经相当快了。

马祖尔：就我们所知的细胞动力学和突变而言，您因为对基因工程发表了漫不经心的评论而遭到了批评。您能就此发表一下您的看法吗？

戴森：我们都能意识到危险，这并不新奇。我觉得每一条路都有风险。费力地让生物这门科学停止前进的步伐并不能解除危险，还不如顺其自然。我很清楚前行的风险，但就算不前行，风险可能一样大。

马祖尔：您很反对近来的战争。原子弹、广岛或曾经作为一名军事顾问，您曾为关于它们的言论后悔过吗？

戴森：不，一点也不。我现在还是一名军事顾间。我觉得挺好的军队需要来自外界的人给他们提供建议，并使他们与外界保持。

马祖尔：显然，您在倡导他们反对战争。

戴森：我主要还是一名数学家。我是在寻找问题，这样我才能在那些有问题的地方找到有用的数学应用。我做的一切都是数学，别人都会这么说。

马祖尔：您能就生命起源再发表一些评论吗？

戴森：我看还是换个话题吧。最近我对「囚徒困境」很感兴趣，那是一个与利他主义的生物进化完全不同的问题。我最近在美国国家科学院发表了一篇关于囚徒困境的论文。

马祖尔：我发现您的书中有一章关于林思·马古利斯（Lynn Margulis)），您说她是「杰出的前辈」之一，尤其因为她对共生关系的研究，您还称赞她在早期进化的研究中起到了示范作用。您怀念她吗？

戴森：对，非常怀念。还有一位女士我也十分敬仰 一一 厄休拉·古德诺（Ursula Goodenough）。您认识她吗？

马祖尔：不认识。

戴森：她也是一位很优秀的生物学家。她在物种进化 一一 新物种的诞生方式方面是个专家。无论如何，我要向大家推荐她，她几乎和马古利斯一样棒。

2『已下载的书籍 Ursula Goodenough 的「2021122The-Sacred-Depths-of-Nature」。（2021-06-09）』

马祖尔：那真是强有力的推荐。我还想问您一个问题，理查德列万延（Richard Lewontin）在《细约书评》的文章中说道，查尔斯达尔文的本意是将自然选择作为一个隐喻，而并非一代又一代的科学家从字面上所理解的那样。您对此作何评论？

戴森：我对此完全不了解。它听起来似乎并没有什么道理。
