Research Lessons

Starting from the top, we learned a few things.

1. You can learn a lot by reading snippets. But as I’ve written before, be careful not to overread the snippets. You can get leads, but follow them up so you understand what’s really going on. In this case, we got our first idea that this could be Moorish in origin and called a「Mudejar star.」

2. Reading results gives you clues. It was by reading about Mudejar stars that we first found the hint that San Rafael Arcángel might have a star window as well. Of course, that led us to the historical quandary about whether or not it originally had such a window. Nevertheless, we found it.

3. Look around in Google Street View when you can’t find the thing that everyone says is there. In this case, the Mudejar star window wasn’t obvious—until you「walked」pegman down the street and looked back.3 THEN it was clear where the star was.

4. When searching for Spanish things, try searching in Spanish! This is obvious in retrospect, I know, but I finally figured it out.

5. Notice what auto-complete is trying to tell you. In this case, one of the auto-completions was in Spanish. Pay attention. Read the signs along the way.

6. Pay attention to the world around you and let your friends help out. I have to point you to the excellent podcast about「The Fancy Shape」on the 99percentinvisible.org website.4 This particular podcast is dedicated to the quatrefoil, a four-leaf clover design, which when you add little barbed-shaped triangles on each lobe becomes the Mudejar star. Oddly enough, I found this podcast purely by serendipity. I’d mentioned my interest in the Mudejar star to a couple of friends, and sure enough, just a few days later, one of them emailed me this link to the podcast. Serendipity can be amplified by social networking and letting people know of your interest. This casts a broad net on your behalf, and suddenly, you’ve got dozens of eyes and ears scanning the world around you for your research questions. It pays to have friends.

How to Do It

A. Poking around.

An incredibly useful thing to know for using Google Maps is how to just「poke around」using Google Street View. Here’s the way that Google Maps looks when you’ve just done a search for [San Rafael Mission] (depending on where you are, you might have to add California in the query).

Now to look around in the area, you can use Google Street View (a collection of images taken on the streets). To see what’s covered in the area, just click on the little yellow icon of a man in the lower-left corner. That’s the pegman, which we’ll use to explore the area. Once pegman is clicked, blue lines will pop up on the map indicating all the streets that have Google Street View images. Notice that there are also some small blue circles. Those are photospheres, which are 360-degree immersive photos you can use to explore an area that’s not on the street (figure 9.13).

To explore an area, click and hold the pegman, dragging him over to some part of the blue lines (or a photosphere circle). When you release the pegman, the image will change to show you that part of the Google Street View.

Once you’ve found a location that you want to explore further, you can then press and hold on the Google Street View image, and then drag it back and forth to see all around. Once you’ve found an item of interest (say, that star-shaped window in the building on the right), just click on the + symbol in the lower right to zoom in (figure 9.16).

Finally, to move your location on the street, just pivot your view to look at the street, and then hover your mouse over the street to see an arrow appear on the street. Clicking on the arrow will move your position to that point on the street. That’s how you poke around in an area to get different views of the thing you’re searching for—in this case, a better view of the star over the window on the building to the right (figure 9.17).

B. Search in Spanish.

With online translation services, searching in other languages has become fast and simple. When I want to search in another language, I just search for [Google Translate], which brings up a translation box at the top of the SERP:

Then you can copy/paste the word(s) from the right side of the tool. (And notice that you can click on the little speaker icon to actually hear the translated text spoken aloud, which might be handy.) At this time, Google Translate can handle over a hundred languages, from Albanian to Zulu, so should you need to search for a special term in Zulu, it’s really fairly easy.

Or if you just want to translate a single word or short phrase, you can do a query like this:

[star in Spanish]

But notice that you can do more than a single word at a time; you can paste large blocks of text, which then will be translated.

Try This Yourself

Just plain old poking around can often lead to remarkable discoveries—especially since you can now poke around using Google Street View. When you combine the ability to wander around another country and Google Translate to change the text you see into your own language, you can visit another country and do lots of research from your computer.

For example, touring Rome, Italy, via an online connection can lead you down some fascinating alleyways.

If you look for the Google Street View images of the Colosseum (aka Colosseo in Italian), you can wander through the interior of this giant battleground that’s nearly two thousand years old.

Figure 9.19

Using Google Maps lets you wander around the Colosseum in Rome. Google Street View lets you walk through the interior of the building and explore the side streets.

Once you find the Colosseum, see if you can find the Domus Aurea nearby. With Google Translate, you’ll be able to understand what the side street names really mean. As is the case with many richly historic cities, street names often capture a good deal of history.

What kinds of things can you discover by just wandering through the side streets around the Colosseum? (Careful: once you start virtually strolling through Rome, you might have to visit in person.)

10 When Was Oil First Discovered in California? How to Discover and Work Through Multiple Competing Claims in Online Resources

How can you get to the bottom of a simple question that has many different answers? Watch out for different versions of the same story!

I grew up in Los Angeles, living somewhere between the beach and Hollywood, in that part of the city that was covered in oil wells, pumpers, and derricks that were drilling for even more oil.

You might not think of Southern California as a big oil production region, but there are oil wells everywhere—from the northern coasts of Santa Barbara down to the long white beaches of San Clemente. The petroleum fields even extend way up into the long, rich agricultural areas of the Central Valley. Not only does the Central Valley produce most of the fruits and nuts for the United States, but it has gigantic oil deposits.

Growing up, for many years I didn’t think much about how, why, or when oil was first produced in the state. I just assumed every place had its own oil supply. Didn’t every place have oil derricks and pumpers going up and down all day, every day? It wasn’t until I moved out of California that I realized oil isn’t everywhere, and it wasn’t always there, like agriculture.

Realizing this, I started to wonder, when and where was oil first discovered in California?

I began doing a bit of searching, and was surprised at how hard it was to get a clear and verifiable answer to a simple question. After all, shouldn’t it be fairly clear WHICH oil well was drilled first, and WHERE the oil was processed? Wouldn’t a quick Google search just answer the question?

This led to my first research question.

Research Question 1: When and where was oil first discovered in California?

When I initially started working on this, I did the obvious search query:

[California oil discovery]

I found lots of resources, each willing to tell me where oil was first found, and a few willing to tell me where it was first refined (or「distilled」or「rectified,」depending on what kind of person was writing the text and when the text was written).

One of the first places I found was an article titled「What’s with Oil? The Probable Status of the Resource.」It was published by the Redlands Fortnightly, a「paper reading」club that’s been active in topics social, agricultural, and historical since 1895. I thought an organization with that amount of history would have a useful perspective.

In that document, the author writes,

In 1865, only 6 years after「Colonel」Edwin Drake’s monumental discovery in Pennsylvania, California’s first productive well was drilled by the Union Mattole Company in California’s Central Valley. This area, east of San Francisco, became the scene of much of the drilling activity through the rest of the 1800’s. While none of these wells were considered major strikes, they did provide enough oil for the nearby market of San Francisco, by far the largest population center in California in the late 1800’s.1

The author is Ty Schuiling, who has degrees in geology, and has worked in the oil industry and at USGS for twenty years.

This would seem conclusive. The only problem is that the Union Mattole Company was active in the Mattole River area. Why is that a problem? When I read that, I realized that I had no idea where the「Mattole River」is—so I looked it up using Google Maps. To my surprise, it’s in Humboldt County, which is fine, but it’s nowhere NEAR the Central Valley or Southern California. This isn’t a minor error; it’s off by a few hundred miles. (For the curious, the Union Mattole Company operated out of the town of Petrolia, previously known as Petrolea—a fact that complicates the search.) This kind of error calls the whole reference into question. Yes, the Central Valley IS a major oil area now, but it wasn’t in the 1860s. How could the author make such an odd mistake?

Take note of that phrase,「California’s first productive well was drilled by the Union Mattole Company in California’s Central Valley.」If you do an exact phrase searchA on this, you’ll find it’s used in twelve different documents. Hmmm. Really? How is that possible?

Another claim that’s made in other documents is that oil was first discovered in Southern California near Santa Clarita at the Pico No. 4 site. The problem here is that most of THESE articles use the phrase,「Many people may be surprised to learn that one of Southern California’s chief exports over the last 100 years, besides motion pictures, has been oil.」If you do a search for the quoted phrase [「one of Southern California’s chief exports over the last 100 years」], you’ll find it’s used in thirty-seven different documents. What? The exact same phrase?

Something fishy is going on here. Why so much obvious copying? I spent several hours looking through all kinds of articles, websites, original news archives, and books to find out. One thing became strikingly clear: there is a HUGE amount of text reuse and repetition on this topic. This makes it difficult to figure out what actually counts.

So after lots of searching through the different documents I found online, what did I discover, and how?

The first thing I noticed is that people knew about the presence of oil, tar, and asphaltum (a kind of semisolid oil) in California for a long time. For instance, Carpinteria was a village to the Chumash people, who used the naturally occurring asphalt to seal their canoes, known as tomols. Petroleum seeps can be seen (and found on your feet when you walk on the beach) near the beach bluffs at Tar Pits Park by the campground of Carpinteria State Beach. This was noted by Fray Juan Crespi in 1769 when his exploration team visited the area.2

This tells me that we have to clarify our research question just a bit in order to get a better answer—one that we can definitively answer. Here’s the new version of the research question that makes it clearer.

Research Question 1 (revised): When was oil first produced as a commercial product in California?

There seems to be four major claims on all the web pages that I found on this topic. From my reading notes they are as follows.

1. In 1876, oil driller Charles Alexander Mentry (aka Charles Alexander Mentrier) struck oil at Pico No. 4 in Pico Canyon in 1875, but a gusher drilled in 1876 was the first truly productive well, which continued to produce until 1990.

2. In 1865, the Union Mattole Company struck oil in Humboldt County and shipped several barrels to San Francisco for refining.

3. Edward Doheny in 1892 used a sharpened eucalyptus tree trunk to drill down 150 feet near present-day Dodger Stadium in downtown Los Angeles.

4. In 1855, Andreas Pico distilled small amounts of oil from Pico Canyon, but had a limited market.

After finding each of these claims, I did a search to determine the origins (and repetitions) of each. As mentioned, the repetitions are numerous; getting down to an original claim is surprising difficult.

The evidence for each is as follows.

1. Mentry: Chevron’s corporate history notes that「in September 1876, driller Alex Mentry succeeded in striking oil in Pico No. 4, despite rattlesnakes, wasps, mud and underbrush. The first successful oil well in California, Pico No. 4 launched California as an oil-producing state.」3 The oil from Pico No. 4 was successfully refined in that year, according to Chevron (which ought to know, as Pico No. 4 was its well, inherited from Standard Oil of California, its predecessor company). The well continued to be productive for another 114 years until it was capped in 1990.

As a major oil company, however, Chevron has a vested interest in having「the first」or「the biggest,」so while this claim is true enough, it depends on what「first successful」means.

Curiously, Pico No. 4 is famous enough to have its own Wikipedia entry.

From the Wikipedia article on「Pico No. 4,」we learn that「well No. 4, the Pico Canyon Oilfield, located about seven miles (11 km) west of Newhall, California in the Santa Susana Mountains, was the first commercially successful oil well in the Western United States, and is considered the birthplace of California’s oil industry. Drilled in 1876, it turned nearby Newhall into a boomtown and also spawned a smaller boomtown called Mentryville adjacent to the drilling site.」4

By following up various leads, it’s easy to find other references that support this assertion. For instance, in 2003, Nicholas Grudin, a staff writer at the Los Angeles Daily News, in his article「Ghosts of an Era: Mentryville Is a Monument to Both the Start and Decline of the Area’s Oil Drilling Industry,」wrote that「Scofield formed California Star Oil Works, and with skilled oil man Alex Mentry, tapped the first commercial oil well in California—Pico No. 4.」5

There’s also Jonathan Gaw’s 1993 article in the Los Angeles Times,「Oil in a Day’s Work: The Boom May Be Over, but a Few Wells Pump On,」in which he writes,「Oil men had been groping around the canyons of the area since 1876, when the first commercially successful oil well west of Pennsylvania was built several miles south of Lechler’s ranch in Pico Canyon.」6 (Of course, that would be Pico No. 4.)

2. Union Mattole Company: Wikipedia, in an article on the history of oil in California, goes with the Union Mattole Company find on the Mattole River in 1865.7 It then amplifies a bit on「first productive」well with a slightly contradictory comment about the Brea-Olinda oil field in Southern California that came online in 1880. (The reference for this claim is Walter August Ver Wiebe’s piece in the 1950 book North American and Middle Eastern Oil Fields.)8 On the other hand, the California State Parks website says that「California’s first drilled oil wells that produced crude to be refined and sold commercially were located on the North Fork of the Mattole River approximately three miles east of here [the town of Petrolia]. The old Union Mattole Oil Company made its first shipment of oil from here, to a San Francisco refinery, in June 1865. Many old well heads remain today.」9

I also found in the Geology of Southern California that「the first drilling for oil in California probably dates from 1861, when a prospect well was drilled on the Davis Ranch in Humboldt County in the northern part of the State. The first recorded production of crude oil in California was from a well drilled by the Union Mattole Oil Company in 1865, near the Mattole River in Humboldt County. The depth of this pioneer oil well is reported to have been 260 feet.」Take note, however, that in the same document, a「prospect well was drilled in 1861 on the Davis Ranch in Humboldt County.」10 Apparently, the prospect of oil on the Davis Ranch also didn’t work out.

If you continue searching in Google Books for Mattole and oil, you’ll find multiple sources that argue the Mattole River area was the first commercial oil site in the state. For example, a much-earlier publication, the California Journal of Mines and Geology (from 1883!), says pretty much the same thing.11

Another book from that same search process, Early California Oil: A Photographic History, 1865–1940, maintains that「the birth of the California petroleum industry proper may be dated to March 25, 1865, with the first commercial sale of oil refined in the state. [T]he Union Mattole Oil company was incorporated [on] June 7, 1865, [and] the first shipment was sent to San Francisco where it was distilled by the Stanford brothers.」12

It’s worth knowing that Walter Stalder records that the Stanford Brothers refined and sold the first shipment of oil from the Mattole well, making it the first oil produced and refined from a California well.13 Reportedly, according to Stalder’s article,「Contribution to California Oil and Gas History,」the refined「burning oil」sold for $1.40 per gallon.14

I found all these sources just by searching inside Google Books for variations on Union Mattole, oil, and commercial. (You could imagine using other terms, but these were productive in terms of finding resources.)

This last book resource is a really useful discovery. Not only does the 1865 Mattole claim have multiple sources of support, but finding a price for the refined product lends a good deal of credibility.

But I can’t resist adding in this tidbit from another article that I found, written by a local historian in the Mattole River valley:

1861: Discovery of oil in the Valley first publicized.

1864: All but a dozen or two of the least troublesome Natives killed or captured. Indian troubles considered over. In 1868 measles kills most survivors.

1865: First oil shipped out by Union Mattole Co. Principal town established and named「Petrolia.」Oil boom short-lived, though experimental drilling and subsequent oil excitement recur periodically.15

Just to muddy things up a bit, an article in the Humboldt Times from 1907 claims that「several large companies began extensive oil operations in 1898.」The author goes on to say that oil will cause the Mattole River valley to flourish, opening up ever-larger markets for the export of tan bark (which she clearly thought would be the salvation of the region, yet with the benefit of twenty-twenty hindsight, we can see how wrong she was).16

3. Doheny: The Doheny claim for commercial oil production in 1892 is made in the book Petroleum in California: A Concise and Reliable History of the Oil Industry.17 But I have to admit this seems a bit unlikely to me. It has all the hallmarks of a tall tale. A well was drilled 150 feet deep with a 60-foot (or 20 meters) eucalyptus tree trunk? Despite the title of the book, I find it difficult to believe this story, although the text (「struck oil by using a 60-foot eucalyptus」) does get repeated often in different versions of the Doheny story, in exactly the same copy-and-paste language.18

4. Pico: Interestingly, this claim of early oil refining by Andreas Pico is ALSO made in the book Petroleum in California and a few other places, but all the articles agree that this was small-time distillation, just for the kerosene lights of the mission in San Fernando to use as illumination. While successful, you wouldn’t really call it a commercial success.

Of course, looking at all these claims more or less inexorably took me to the Wikipedia entry on the「California Oil and Gas Industry,」which claims that oil has been known since the dawn of time from the large number of oil and tar seeps that seem to sprout from the soil every few miles throughout the state.19 There are oil seeps in Northern California, the Central Valley, and of course Southern California. But the Petroleum in California book tells us that a company began working the La Brea tar pits (in Los Angeles) in 1856 by building tunnels that would let the oil run out into holding ponds, although there’s no reference cited. This seems fishy to me; tar pits are on pretty flat land, and the closest hills are the Hollywood Hills, which are three miles from the pits. How to check up on this claim? I did a quick check with the query:

[1856 oil gas history tunnels]

I was able to find a document Oil and Gas Production: History in California (published by the California State Department of Conservation).20

This was a huge surprise; yes, people DID dig tunnels at the La Brea tar pits near the exact center of Los Angeles, but gave up when drilling holes in the ground proved much simpler and more productive than digging tunnels and letting the oil flow out slowly.

Some thirty miles (or forty-eight kilometers) as the oil-black crow flies from the tar pits, near Santa Paula, California, Josiah Stanford dug about thirty tunnels into the oil-bearing mountainsides, slanting them upward so oil flowed down to the entrance. Some tunnels reportedly produced up to twenty barrels of oil per day. The oil flowing steadily from the tunnels made Stanford one of the top oil producers of the late 1860s. The tunnels produced more oil in California than any other method until the development of oil wells drilled with more modern methods. These tunnels continued to slowly deliver oil until the mid-1990s, when they were finally abandoned and plugged up. (Strangely enough, another thirty miles [or forty-eight kilometers] due west of Santa Paula are the still-productive oil islands in the Santa Barbara Channel. One of these—Platform A—spilled around a hundred thousand barrels of oil in early 1969, making more than a few seabirds and crows truly oil black.)

My conclusion from looking at lots of evidence for the competing claims is this: the Union Mattole Company had the first commercial sales of refined oil from a California oil well in Humboldt County on the Mattole River in 1865. Alas, the well wasn’t productive for very long (a year or two at most), and so the award for earliest, best, long-term continued success goes to Pico No. 4, which began operations eleven years later in 1876, with continuous oil production for over a century.

As we’ve seen, it’s not simple to figure out when and where oil was first discovered in California. In fact, it’s complicated for two key reasons.

Figure 10.2

California’s first commercial oil well, Pico No. 4, produced thirty barrels per day when Alex Mentry completed it on September 26, 1876, for the Star Oil Works Company. This prompted the owners to set up the Pacific Coast Oil Company, a forerunner of Standard Oil Company of California.

First, there’s a lot of not-so-great scholarship out there, even in books and what seems like primary sources. In particular, there’s a lot of repetition of errors that were introduced early on and somehow never corrected. (That’s what I mean by poor scholarship. Just repeating something that you found on the internet doesn’t make it right; it merely makes it repetitious. And if you didn’t double check it in the first place, you’re earning yourself a particularly nasty place in hell.)

Second, there are multiple interests at work, each arguing that THEIR particular oil strike was first. You can imagine why they’d say this; being first to find oil gives you a special cachet, a kind of romantic wildcatter kind of image.

Research Lessons

As you do your searching to find answers to your research questions, you’re usually seeking something that’s rare. But every so often, you’ll find too much information from different sources that’s just a bit inconsistent. In this case, you need to sift through what you find. Here’s how to do that sifting in order to find what’s true and accurate.

1. You need to know WHAT it is you’re searching for and define the question carefully. What does it mean to be the「first to discover oil in California?」If you consider that the Native Americans had been using tar from the La Brea pits, then the discovery was when they first showed up on the scene, back in the days of saber-toothed cats, mastodons, and dire wolves (around 10,000 BCE). That led me to shift the research question a bit to make it something that I could definitively answer.

2. Be aware of duplications in the content you find. There are many reasons you’ll find duplicated content, but when the duplications are unattributed, you have to be a little wary about the content. It might be correct, and the duplication is just careless editing, but it also suggests that the authors are not paying particular attention to their writing. As a side effect, texts that have lots of duplicated content don’t really count as another citation. It’s just copied.

3. Organize what you find. This turned out to be a complicated research question because there’s SO much content, with much of it telling variant stories. In the end, I started taking notes on each of the competing claims, with one set of notes for the Union Mattole claim, another for the Doheny claim, and so forth. All I did was to write down the key points (year of discovery, year of first commercialization, and so forth) and then the URLs to the place where I found each assertion. In the end, I had a big table of competing claims, and the evidence to back them up. Armed with that set of notes, I could figure out the answer to the research question!

How to Do It

A. Exact phrase search.

To search for a complete phrase, just put the phrase in double quotes. In the example above, I did this search:

[「California’s first productive well was drilled by the Union Mattole Company in California’s Central Valley」]

Obviously, you want to get the whole phrase, and when you do, you’ll see that this exact phrase is used verbatim on a number of different web pages from different sites, each claiming that this is the correct history of oil discovery in the Golden State. Often I’ll use just a few distinctive words rather than a long sentence. In this case, the phrase「California’s first productive well was drilled」would have been enough. (I used the entire sentence here because I was looking for long sections of duplicated text.)

Try This Yourself

This chapter is about ways to notice when a「second source」isn’t really a second source—when it’s merely a copy of another, earlier document. There are lots of reasons why writers do this; sometimes they’re just copying the text as a reference, but sometimes they’re just lazy and copy big pieces of text without thinking.

When you’re doing your own online research, you have to take note when your sources are copying other sources. When you find the wholesale lifting of texts, you should be worried, since it suggests that the research underlying the document hasn’t been checked carefully. Copying like that is the mark of a lazy researcher; don’t trust that article (but perhaps look around for the original).

As I do my research, I’ll sometimes notice when particular phrases (especially clever and curious turns of language) keep reappearing as I read. Those are the sentences (or sentence fragments) you want to double check.

One hint is to look for those repeated phrases. As you check for duplication, you don’t want to check for duplicate titles. But a well-chosen phrase (that is, one that’s central to the argument, and long enough to be unlikely to happen by accident) can be a useful way to see how far that article has spread. People often choose to copy rather than rewrite the central idea of an article.

For instance, in an article about the worldwide effects of the Chicxulub asteroid impact and how it caused a global mass extinction, a key sentence fragment is this:「lead us to conclude that the Chicxulub impact triggered the mass extinction.」21

I chose the particular part of a sentence that summarized the entire article, but that wasn’t so long it might be changed in the process. Do a search for this sentence fragment:

[「lead us to conclude that the Chicxulub impact triggered the mass extinction」]
