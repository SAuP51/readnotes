On the other hand, I did notice a few large brush complexes that didn’t have a barren zone—but in all cases, they were on fairly steep slopes. I hadn’t anticipated that, although it fits in with the small mammal herbivory effect causing the barren zones. Squirrels don’t seem to mind a slope, but I suspect that rabbits don’t want to be grazing downslope of a brush complex if a predator comes along. Running uphill isn’t a great defensive strategy.

Try This Yourself

As you look around the world (say, on Google Earth or another planetary image system), you’ll see some fairly remarkable things—patterns and features that cry out for an explanation. Here are two that are worth a bit of research.

1. What are these vertical stripes in figure 15.20? They’re located in Florida at 25.3925583, −80.3561022. Take a look and see if you can figure out why they’re there. (And once you understand that, maybe you’ll discover what particular kind of large animal is attracted to them!)

2. This is an odd Earth pattern (in figure 15.21) that asks for some research. This strikingly circular lake is in Canada at 61.276851, −73.6827605 about 1,000 miles (or 1.6 kilometers) north of Quebec City. It also has no streams coming in or out—yet there are fish in the lake. Can you determine what the story of this remarkably round lake is?

As you do your research, be aware of what your biases are and what you need to do in order to not get stuck on your first impression. As we learned in this chapter, you will probably need to look at multiple resources to get a complete understanding of what’s going on in each of these images.

This unusual pattern is caused by something large and planned. Can you figure out what this is?

Figure 15.21

A perfectly circular lake seems artificial, and with no inflow or outflow, it’s an amazing body of water. What is it? What kind of fish would live in such a place?

16 Is Abyssinia the Same as Eritrea? How to Find Additional Context Information for Your Research

Not only do names for ordinary things change, but just as important, people and countries change their names. This happens a lot. But tracking the changes in the names of countries is a somewhat-different skill set than understanding why we rarely talk about people with rose catarrh any more.

Annoyingly, finding names is often simple, but it can get complicated quickly if (and when) names change—whether it’s the name of a person or country.

People change names, frequently when they marry or for professional reasons. Take, for instance, Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, aka the rocker Sting. Names can get arbitrarily complicated when people change their professional names multiple times (such as the rapper born as Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr., who also has been known by the names Snoop Rock, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Snoop Lion, DJ Snoopadelic, Snoopzilla Bigg, Snoop Dogg, and Snoop Scorsese).

Even quite ordinary people have variable names. I’m「Daniel Russell」in some, slightly formal places. At the same time, I use「Dan Russell」in situations that are pedestrian, and「Daniel M. Russell」in my professional writings. Of course, I’m「Daniel M. Russell, PhD」when I need to be (such as in formal settings, like professional visits to Japan, where having a professional credential attached to your name gives you a bit of cachet, or whatever the Japanese equivalent of cachet is).

And to make it REALLY difficult, there are artists like Prince Rogers Nelson who have a surfeit of names. Prince Rogers Nelson, aka the single-name artist Prince, also used the songwriter aliases of Jamie Starr, Joey Coco, Tora Tora, Alexander Nevermind, and Christopher Tracy. He is, of course, also referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (TAFKAP), with a difficult-to-search-for symbol (figure 16.1).

Figure 16.1

Go ahead and think about how to search for this artist’s symbol/glyph/name. The good news is that using the Search by ImageA method works pretty well here.

Names can be difficult to search for—both names of people (or symbols of people) and places. While you might think that tracking the changes in names of places (cities, countries, and neighborhoods) is similar to the way that one tracks the changes in people names, the fact that it’s about geographic names puts a whole new spin on the topic.

This question came up while I was reading a book about the history of Venice. To us English speakers, the place we call the city of Venice is known as Venezia in Italian, but it also has a nickname, La Serenissima, which is the poetic, graceful, affectionate, and diminutive form. But historically it was known to Latin speakers as Venetica, and as Ἐνετοί to the Greeks. Which of these is the city’s true name? Of course, they’re all right; it just depends on who you’re talking to, in what language, and when. We don’t often think about time as a determiner of names, but it’s an important thing to remember when you’re doing online research.

For instance, the Greek island of Crete, with its long history, has many names: in modern Greek it’s Κρήτη (’kriti), in ancient Greek it’s Κρήτη (Krḗtē), to the Venetians it’s Candia, and before that it was known to the ancient world as Κρήτη (Kaptara)! None of those are spelled「Crete,」the way I’d search for it in English.

Figure 16.2

This is an important issue when you’re searching for information about a place. If you’re lucky, the articles that you’re searching for will have all those names listed somewhere. But you can’t always count on it, especially when you want to start looking for historical references and content.

Probably the best-known name-shifting city is the city currently known as Istanbul, which was previously known as Constantinople. (There’s even a song about the name change! Written in 1953, this novelty song, with lyrics by Jimmy Kennedy and music by Nat Simon, titled「Istanbul (Not Constantinople),」also points out that「Old New York was once New Amsterdam,」which makes the point lyrically.)

Since Venice is such an important place in European history, I’ve been exposed to many of the variants of its name. But oddly enough, I grew up in Los Angeles, which you’ll sometimes hear called the City of Angels, even though the hometown baseball team is called the Dodgers because it was an immigrant to the town in the 1950s. The Angels baseball team is from Anaheim, about sixty miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles. In any case, you’d think that I’d know about the variations of the city’s name. So it was with some surprise that I read about the connection between Venice and a city known as El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula. From the context and name, I thought it might be Los Angeles as I know it, but reading this led to the following research questions.

Research Question 1: Where is El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula? What is that city called today?

Research Question 2: Because the book I was reading was set in the 1700s, it was rich with historical references and so made me wonder, What would that place (El Pueblo …) have been called in 1600, before the Spanish arrived?

I started by just searching for the long form of the city name, mostly because it’s SO specific that nothing else will match this magnificently wordy place-name:

[El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula]

That search tells you quickly that this is the place also known as Los Angeles, California (aka LA). The Wikipedia page shares the story that Franciscan monk Juan Crespí tells about the Portolá expedition being impressed by a river it named El Río de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula—meaning「the River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciuncula.」The name derives from Santa Maria degli Angeli, a small town in Italy housing the Porciuncula, a tiny plot of land that held the church where Saint Francis of Assisi lived. Various versions of Crespí’s name would be used for the town, including the exceedingly long El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Ángeles sobre el Río Porciúncula and other variations on that theme.

Other variations that I’ve seen in my research (from a variety of sources) include:

El Pueblo de la Reina de los Angeles Sobre el Rio de Porciúncula

El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles de la Porciúncula

El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles

El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reyna de los Angeles

El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reyna de los Angeles del Rio Porciúncula

Pueblo del Rio de Nuestra Señora la Reyna de los Angeles de Porciúncula

Of course, Gaspar de Portolá’s expedition didn’t reach the Los Angeles Basin until 1769. What would the locals have called that place before he arrived?

As you know, Los Angeles is a huge place—so when I think about「that place,」what do I mean? The point where the city was founded? The largest nearby settlement of Indians who live nearby? Where the first building was constructed? How about the first Catholic mission?

How would you find out? Here’s my general query:

[History of Los Angeles]

It leads to the Wikipedia article on Los Angeles history, which has a section on「prehistory,」which tells us that the Tongva people who inhabited the area when the Spanish arrived called the Los Angeles region Yaanga in their language. And what’s more, the Spanish pueblo was located near a large village on the river.

To complicate things, the DiscoverLosAngeles.com website claims that around AD 500, Tongva Indians settled in the Los Angeles Basin, displacing the previous inhabitants, the Tataviam (later called the Fernandeno).1 By the sixteenth century, the region’s main village was called Yang-Na, near present-day Los Angeles City Hall.

We’ve got two somewhat-different names for the pre-Spanish village. Let’s do some background checking here. What sources are cited for each of the names?

Yaanga is cited in the Wikipedia article in a book by Pamela Munro and colleagues, titled Yaara’ Shiraaw’ax ’Eyooshiraaw’a. Now You’re Speaking Our Language: Gabrielino/Tongva/Fernandeño.2 When I search for this book on Lulu.com (a self-publishing site), however, I find that there are two books with different authors. One is by Pamela Munro, and the other is by Julia Bogany. This is slightly suspicious; it’s a self-publishing site. BUT when I search for these authors by name, I find that Munro is a linguist at the University of California at Los Angeles with extensive work in Native American languages, including Tongva! Bogany turns out to be a Tongva elder who teaches the language and culture of the Tongva. These aren’t just random self-publishers with a passing interest; they are world experts on the Tongva language.

If you’re ever going to find two experts in the Tongva language, these are the people you’d find. And when you look at both books, it’s clearly the same book; one is just a「large print」edition.

I was able to find Munro’s email address without much trouble—so I wrote to her and asked her opinion about the name. She graciously wrote back (almost instantly!), saying,「The basic form of the name was probably Yaar or Yaay; we don’t know. Different endings are added to the root Yaa- (not a word). The -nga ending means ‘in’ and is also used for the form people usually give for village names.」

How about the other name for the village?

Yang-Na is used in the DiscoverLosAngeles article, but has no citation for the source of the name. In this case, I did a quoted search:

[「yang-na」]

I discovered a lot of Chinese artist results and a mention in US history (again, without any reference for the name), but a mention that Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo came across the Yang-na village in 1542, noting the location on his map as he continued his exploration.

I shifted my search to:

[「yang-na」Cabrillo]

That search then gave me a bunch of results. This name is used just about everywhere. But after extensive searching, I haven’t been able to find a decent citation about where the name came from OR Cabrillo’s map with the name「Yang-Na」on it. (I’ll keep looking, but right now, it seems like a less used variation of the other name.)

So let’s go with what the Tongva experts (and Wikipedia) call it: Yaanga.

Of course, this kind of research lends itself to a bit of spreading out of interests. As I was reading about El Pueblo and Yang-Na, I ran across a lot of other place-names. Having grown up in Los Angeles, I knew many of them, but I kept seeing a reference to a place called Humqaq. That’s an unusual name, yet it was clearly local to the greater Los Angeles region. So what’s the story behind Humqaq?

The obvious query [Humqaq] tells us that this is Point Conception, just west of the Southern California city of Santa Barbara, northwest of Los Angeles by about a three-hour drive up Highway 101.

The Wikipedia article about Humqaq (aka Point Conception) says that「Point Conception was first noted by Spanish maritime explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo in 1542 and named Cabo de Galera. In 1602, Sebastian Vizcaíno sailed past again, renaming the protruding headland Punta de la Limpia Concepción (‘Point of the Immaculate Conception’). Vizcaíno’s name stuck, and was later anglicized to today’s version.」3

Figure 16.3

Point Conception on Google Earth. Santa Barbara (and Los Angeles) are to the east.

If you keep reading, you’ll eventually find out that「it was called Humqaq (‘The Raven Comes’) in the Chumashan languages.」4 So the name Humqaq is the Chumash name of the point.

After the lesson of Yaanga, it’s worth doing a bit of checking. To follow up and find a second source, I used this information in a query:

[Point Conception Cabrillo]

This finds multiple confirming sources. For instance, it found Paul A. Myers’s 2004 book, North to California: The Spanish Voyages of Discovery, 1533–1603.5 This book tells exactly the same story, giving great, high-quality references that you can check.

The trouble with reading history is that the questions just keep coming. Remember that the book I was reading was set in the 1700s and it kept mentioning a place called Óbuda. From the context, I knew it was in southeastern Europe, not so far from Venice. So naturally this led to my next question.

Research Question 3: Where is the city of Óbuda? And what’s this place called now?

As I did last time, I started by simply searching for the city’s name. (Notice that I didn’t try a complicated query at first; strategically, I usually begin my searching with a short, simple query. That way I pick up on any ambiguous uses of the terms and don’t get sent down a rathole of spurious results. Start simple; it generally works out for the best.)

[Óbuda]

Any number of resources linked by this search tells us that this is or was a city in Hungary that was merged with Buda and Pest in 1873. This area now forms part of District III-Óbuda-Békásmegyer of Budapest. The name means Old Buda in Hungarian (or in German, Alt-Ofen). The name in Croatian and Serbian for this city is Stari Budim, but the local Croat minority calls it Obuda (the name Budim is used for the fortress in Buda).

So it’s Budapest. Again, to check, I did a query for:

[history Budapest]

I found Budapest’s official city website, which tells the same story.6

Now that we’re thinking about geographic name changes, What other places have interesting name shifts over time?

With its turbulent history, Africa is full of name changes (and even official language changes) over time. Here’s another research question about a country that’s undergone a number of changes with time.

Research Question 4: What was the historical name of the country where the city of Dar Es Salaam is today—say, pre-1964?

To answer this question, you’re going to need to start looking for historical documents about the city of Dar Es Salaam. That’s fine, but do you know off the top of your head what country you need to look for? I didn’t, so I began finding out a bit about the city of Dar Es Salaam with this query:

[Dar Es Salaam]

I learned that it’s in Tanzania. That’s great, so the next obvious query here is:

[history of Tanzania]

I found Google’s web answer:「On 26 April 1964, Tanganyika united with Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The country was renamed the United Republic of Tanzania on 29 October of that year. The name Tanzania is a blend of Tanganyika and Zanzibar and previously had no significance.」7

I have to admit that I grew up with Tanganyika as a country in Africa and was vaguely aware that it had ceased to be sometime in the mid-1960s, but I didn’t know that the new country name is a portmanteau word combining Zanzibar and Tanganyika!

So if you’re searching for information about the region around Dar Es Salaam, you’d want to know about this name change. Sometimes you have to look not just for the answer to your research question but also for the answer to a larger, more encompassing question—in this case, the history of the country.

Speaking of countries in Africa, the shifts in political fortunes sometimes makes asking questions a little tricky. Be careful about what you ask, as you just might have hidden assumptions built into your question. For example, here’s a reasonable-sounding research question.

Research Question 5: What was the name of the capital of Zaire in 1900?

Again, here’s another African country name that I was aware had changed, but I didn’t really know much about the transformation process. This is the kind of research problem that has to take the passage of time and potential changes into account.

The obvious search is:

[capital of Zaire]

It gives you the following result on Google (figure 16.4).

But be careful! While this result is true, if you just accept this answer straightaway, you’d be missing an important fact. In 2018 as I write this book, Zaire is no longer a country. It’s always a good idea to do a quick double check about the surrounding information, especially if you know that African countries have a tendency to shift names in the course of history. So if you now do a background search to learn about Zaire, you’d do this:

[Zaire]

Figure 16.4

A search for [capital of Zaire] shows Kinshasa as the result. Be sure to check the context!

You’ll quickly find out that Zaire was the name for the Democratic Republic of the Congo—a country that existed only for twenty-six years, between 1971 and 1997.

This is a crucial point: check your work! Be sure you get the context surrounding what you’re searching for! Kinshasa IS now the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was the capital of Zaire.

Yet remember the research question?「What was the capital of Zaire in 1900?」This is a bit of a tricky question, but it’s the kind of question that comes up all the time. It’s the type of question that arises in real research; search questions don’t necessarily have to make sense or be internally coherent. That’s the way this question is: Zaire didn’t exist before 1971. So asking,「What’s the capital in 1900?」is an inherently odd question.

What, then, is a reasonable interpretation?

I’d say the question is really like this: What WAS that part of Central Africa called in 1900?

Reading about the history of Zaire tells us that it was formed out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1960.8 Before 1960, this country was called the Belgian Congo, which was established by Belgium through annexation in 1908.

OK, what was it before 1908?

Reading carefully, you’ll find that a group of European nations (the Berlin Conference), divided up the area of the Congo, ceding it to Belgium. As a result, King Leopold II of Belgium received a large share of territory (2,344,000 square kilometers, or 905,000 square miles) to be organized as the Congo Free State. The Congo Free State operated as a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II through a nongovernmental organization, the Association Internationale Africaine. The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo (and therefore Zaire) and existed from 1885 to 1908, when the government of Belgium annexed the area.

So what was the capital of the Congo Free State?

[capital Congo Free State]

We find that Boma was the capital city of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo (the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo) from 1886 to 1926, when the capital was moved to Léopoldville (since renamed Kinshasa).

To double check, I search:

[history of Boma Congo]

That leads to several books, such as the Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, containing background information that agrees with this.9

I would say that in 1900, Boma was the capital of the region of the Congo that was known as Zaire and is now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Interestingly, as I was doing this research, I tried other search engines as well. (You should too, from time to time, just to be sure you know what is possible.) The results are variable. Sometimes they’re right, and sometimes they’re almost yet not quite right. More often, they present the information without the surrounding context that you need to really understand things.

On the other hand, there are other search engines that get it definitively wrong, telling us that the capital is Kinshasa, which can’t be right. (The Democratic Republic of Congo didn’t exist in 1900.)

Figure 16.5

Google doesn’t give all the details, but just gives ordinary search results (which is probably really the right thing to do—although see chapter 20, since in the future, this will probably change). This is an important skill for researchers; don’t overread what’s in the result, but see it for what it is. In this case, you must go deeper to see the context of Zaire in 1900.

Since this is true, is there a single reference work (hopefully online!) that would let you answer all these questions? What would a work be called?

One kind of useful document to know is the gazetteer. It’s basically a geographic dictionary or directory that has information about the geographic makeup as well as social and physical features of a country, region, or other place. A gazetteer usually has the subject’s place in the world and almanac-style information (dimensions of mountains, rivers, oceans, waterways, population, gross domestic product, literacy rate, and so on).

A historical gazetteer is a gazetteer with information about place-names and events, and how those change over time. To find such things, you first have to know what a「gazetteer」is and then you can search for historical versions of the same with this query:

[historical gazetteers]

It finds several pages of gazetteers and collections of maps. I found that the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency’s mapping gazetteer works well to find place-names (and associated data) from all around the world.10

Figure 16.6

Using this query, a little further down on the page I found the Historical Gazetteer of the United States in Google Books (by Paul T. Hellmann) in which I found the following entry for Los Angeles (by using the search box on the Google Books page).11

Note the highlighted passages. This reference book uses the「Yang-na」form of the Tongva village name and gives one of the variations on the long Spanish name of Los Angeles.

Another useful reference to know about is the「dictionary of place-names」that several reference publishers issue. It’s often useful to search for such a dictionary for a given place. Here are a couple of examples that I’ve used:

[dictionary place-names]

[dictionary place-name British]

[dictionary place-names California]

These will find resources that can answer all kinds of questions about how geographic place-names change over time!

Finally, the last research question on place-name changes.

Research Question 6: IS Abyssinia the same as Eretria?

First, exactly what is Abyssinia? Let’s do a quick overview search:

[Abyssinia]

We can easily learn that Abyssinia was「the Ethiopian Empire, historically known as Abyssinia, a nation that comprised the northern half of present-day Ethiopia.」But as we know, you should read the entire description, and thus you’ll discover on the Wikipedia entry for Abyssinia that「Ethiopia, the modern nation remains known by its (name) Abyssinia.」12
