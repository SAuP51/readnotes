Research Lessons

There are a few key lessons here.

1. Sometimes you have to go off-line to complete your research. This is a book about online research, but the reality is that not everything is digitized and available online. There are enough clues in the online world, however, so I was able to find the physical logbook and then look at the actual record of events, written in elegant longhand on board the USS North Carolina. Yes, more and more stuff IS being digitized, but many archives don’t have the resources to move everything into the digital realm. So sometimes you have to visit the archives in real life. That’s how I ended up in Wilmington on a rainy afternoon visiting the original copy of the USS North Carolina logbook.

2. Follow the chain of references. In essence, this chapter is a story about going from a query, to articles about Delos, to discovering that logbooks exist, to using a finding aid to locate the logbook, to physical archives. Once I found the finding aid that pointed to the logbook, I had to go to the Stanford rare book room to find the accession number for the logbook in Delaware, then to the Hagley library in Delaware to read the logbook, and then realized that I needed to find better evidence. I found other logbooks, and finally discovered the finding aid for the Rodgers Family Papers collection, going in person to the Library of Congress to finally find a personal letter confirming that they were on Delos. That’s quite a trail, with a mix of online searching and off-line reading.

3. If you keep digging, you can find remarkable things. I didn’t know that we’d be able to locate the logbook of the ship that took the graffiti artists to Delos. This is a nice example where doing one more query takes your research to a whole new level. Even better, I didn’t realize that the trail would lead me to reading nineteenth-century personal letters in order to uncover what really happened on Delos.

4. Remember to follow parallel paths to get to what you seek. In the above example, the trick that got us to the logbook of the USS North Carolina was to do a search for Commodore Rodgers, who we KNEW had to be on board with Perry. That kind of parallel searching is incredibly useful (when you can do it). Sometimes the shortest path to your goal is to find someone (or something) that must also be closely related to what you’re searching.

5. Serendipity favors the prepared mind. This research voyage into the tour of Perry began with my spotting his name and date on the stone. Before going to Greece, I knew something about Perry; his name was well known to me, not because of Greek history, but because of what I know about Japanese history. His name is well known in world history, yet it wasn’t a straight path from Delos to the archive in Wilmington—although I’m glad that I followed the path.

6. Learn as you go. As you read, notice things that might be useful later on in your searching. When I was studying Perry, I learned about Rodgers. That chance「learning while searching」led me to the Library of Congress archives and that letter from Rodgers to his wife telling the story of being on the island, confirming that Perry was on Delos.

7. Go a bit deeper than you think you need to go. I was surprised to learn that the first logbook was great, but that both the second and third logbooks were even better! When you’re doing research, it’s often worth searching to the bottom of the page of results, and for historical research like this, maybe even going one page deeper into the results. You might find buried treasure!

Try This Yourself

Almost every city and town has an archive somewhere nearby, and they’re often full of images and stories from your town, your city, and the lives of the people around you.

In the course of this chapter, I ended up using four different archives (Stanford’s rare book room, the Hagley Museum and Library, the archives at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Library of Congress archives). All I did was ask nicely if I could use their archival content. Sometimes you have to get a reader’s card (just like a library card), but in every archive I’ve visited, I’ve never been turned down.

So explore your local archive; do a quick Google search for [archive city name] for the archives near you. Once you find one, check first to see if they’ve got any online content that you can easily access. (Checking their online holdings can frequently save you a trip to a closed place or can reveal to you the treasures that they have ready for you to investigate.) Once you’ve found one, they can often direct you to the next, and the next.

Some sample questions to ask of your hometown: Can you find the early history of your town? In my city, the main library has a beautiful archive of early city historical imagery and maps. Once you can see into the past, research questions will spring up in your mind easily. When and why was this city founded? Why did the founders choose this particular place? How was the original grid of city streets established? Or was it all organic, following old paths and trails lost in the mists of time?

19 On Being a Great Searcher: Rules of Thumb for Asking Great Questions

What does it take to be a great online searcher? Here’s a set of observations about what I’ve seen great researchers do. First, you have to understand what it is that you’re asking, both in terms of what the question is about (in your opinion) and what you’re learning as you do your research. But there’s more—much more—to being really good at searching.

I need to point out a few things I’ve learned that successful researchers all share.

I’ve summarized these observations about how to do great research into three sets of observations: behaviors (what they do when doing research), attitudes (the way that they deal with setbacks and the search process), and rules of thumb for asking good questions.

As I’ve watched the way that truly expert searchers work, I’ve noticed how they frame their investigations, what attitudes they have in common, the manner in which they follow up on ideas, and the way they get to answers.1 (And to be honest, I’ve also watched the way that a lot of people make serious mistakes as they search. Those negative lessons are valuable too, if only to illustrate what NOT to do.)

These aren’t just three random lists of good practices to do while you research. They’re based on the past thirteen years of my own studies, where I’ve watched thousands of researchers trying to answer questions. I’ve watched professional fact-checkers, journalists, and just plain folks trying to search for good answers to their questions. Whether you’re investigating a breaking news story or trying to determine the best refrigerator to buy, we all do much of our research online—and these points summarize the way that you can be fast, accurate, and reliable in your research. Here are the behaviors, attitudes, and rules of thumb for being a great researcher.

Behaviors of Great Researchers

Here are a few things that are common among all the really good searchers. This isn’t a complete list, but they reflect the patterns that I’ve seen most often.

1. They figure out what the question really is. As you’ve seen in each of the chapters so far, I start with a bit of a curious story and then translate that into a research question. An important skill is the ability to see a problem and convert it into a researchable question. That’s why I’ve been giving the research questions at the beginning of each chapter. Learning how to convert a vague feeling, hunch, or lingering sense of not understanding into a research question is an important step.

Even if you don’t write down your research question, it’s useful to pause for a moment to clarify what you seek. A common problem among beginning searchers is that they’re not clear about what the goal is and start searching a bit blindly.

A good research question is also something that you, the researcher, really understand. A great mental checkpoint is to ask yourself,「Do I really understand what my research question means?」

Often, you’ll have to learn to DEFINE terms in your questions. Take the research question,「How far is it to the Moon?」You’ll want to clarify that question a bit. Do you mean,「The center of the Moon to the center of the Earth?」or「From the closest point on the Moon to the closest point on the Earth?」

Or suppose your research question is「I want to learn about the Civil War.」That’s great, but fairly open ended. WHICH civil war? There are a bunch; luckily, search engines figure out where you are and give you the most common interpretation of civil war. But in some countries, that’s not obvious; perhaps you meant the most recent civil war? If you’re in the United States, does your question mean the US Civil War or the English Civil War? (And if the latter, which one? Inconveniently, England has had multiple wars of incivility.)

This is an important point. You must be clear about what you’re asking—otherwise you’ll find an answer to a question that might not mean what you think.

In chapter 10, we had to figure out what「first oil discovered」really meant. Was it the「first to notice an oil-like substance」? Or do you mean the「first to pump it out of the ground」? Or the「first to produce oil products (like gasoline) for sale」? In a real sense, clarifying the question is the primary research strategy.

2. Great researchers recognize what they’re doing as they search; they understand the problems, questions, and areas of uncertainty and doubt. One of the things that struck me when watching great researchers is that they think about their research questions fairly explicitly and clearly as they do their searching. If you interrupt one of these folks, they can tell you what they’re doing at the moment and why. (In the chapter on searching for Perry’s graffiti, I could give you a good reason why I went this far out on a research limb. Why did I go to the archives at the Library of Congress? Because「I’m searching for the Rodgers Family Papers at the library archives because I need to find out what the crew did while on Delos, and I suspect there’s a document there.」) But by the nature of research, you don’t know how well it’s going to turn out. Great researchers also follow plenty of clues that turn out to be dead ends. Nevertheless, they’re usually pretty clear about what the research question is, and how much they know (at any point) about the target of their work.

This means that you, as a researcher, have to understand what you know, what you don’t know, and how confident you are that what you DO know is accurate. What you do from there in your searching is largely determined by this balance of known and what you need to figure out next. Online research is often a process, meaning that you’re moving from a place where you don’t know much to one where you have good understanding. Your next query is largely determined by what you need to know next.

3. They understand that they need to contextualize what they find. One of the most common strengths of good researchers is that they don’t just answer the question as stated but instead learn how to understand the context around the question.

What’s context? It’s the information that helps you understand what you’re finding in a larger sense, usually by telling you what you also need to know to interpret the information that you’re finding.

For instance, if you find that a restaurant has a score of 4.5 out of 5, that sounds great—but knowing that there are only three reviews is a bit of context that helps you understand that it might not be that impressive. If the review score is 4.5 over two thousand reviews, that’s a different story.

Almost everything that you search for needs a bit of context to help you make sense of the information. In particular, when reading an article with statistical information, that almost guarantees that you’ll need some context to understand the rest of the story. Instead of being shocked that the temperature was forty-five degrees yesterday, look for the longer trends and context that will help you interpret that. Was this temperature an isolated data point that’s really different from other days? Perhaps most important, was that the temperature in Marrakesh (where that forty-five would be in Celsius) or San Francisco (where that would be a typical evening’s temperature in Fahrenheit).

Great searchers do more than just find an answer to a research question; they also talk to subject experts, read papers and critiques in their area, and study articles that talk about the topic. They constantly ask themselves,「What else should I know in order to see how this information fits into a larger context?」

4. They select what to ask questions about. This is an important skill that’s as much about good taste as it is about good research. You can’t ask questions about everything, so how do you decide what to ask questions about?

Answer: basically, you ask questions about the unusual, the thing that’s driving your curiosity. That is, you ask questions about the things that stick out for you—the odd, or the thing that strikes you as not quite right. This means that you need to know what’s normal and what’s not. For instance, in the oil well chapter, I say that there are more fruits and nuts grown in California than anywhere else. You might just accept that because it sounds fairly reasonable and comes in a form that seems believable (in particular, that it’s in this book). But you would check it if you thought it was weird or at odds with what you already know.

For example, suppose I’d said something that you found really hard to believe—maybe,「There are more Armenians living in California than in Armenia.」THAT’s the kind of thing you’d want to check.

Of course, when you’re in the middle of a search process, you’re frequently on the trail, running down a piece of the story that you need to know about. In these situations, it’s crucial to stay on track, and not get diverted by all the shiny and sparkling things that want to take you off the topic. That’s yet another reason to keep your research question in front of you. Yes, there’s always something odd and strange that might take you off the path, but resist that impulse; stay on your question until you complete the research. (If you must, take a note about things to return to later. I often do this while searching, and then when I look at the list later, I can’t imagine why I would want to follow up.)

5. They already know a bunch of stuff. It seems paradoxical, but it’s deeply true: the more you know about a topic, the more you can do research in it. That’s because the more you recognize (terms, concepts, and relationships), the better you are at noticing what’s important and what’s not. Online research tools are truly excellent, but people who know more about a domain simply do better research in that domain.

For instance, in chapter 14 we learned about Key’s family. Because I’d already read and knew about his son, Philip, I was surprised when I saw his name in a new story that didn’t match the story I’d already read. That is, when you know something of the background (the people, places, events, and relationships), anything that sticks out (because you haven’t seen it before) is probably interesting. It doesn’t match the pattern you already know and so is possibly worth chasing.

The bottom line is that good researchers do well in part because they already know things about the world at large. In addition, they also understand what the tools can and cannot do.

6. They understand coverage and limitations. Researchers who use search engines and online research tools every day need to understand what’s possible to do with them, and the assumptions that are built into them.

Search engine coverage is impressively large, but we have to overcome the illusion of omniscience (particularly with students learning to do their research online). It’s worth remembering that what’s searchable online is not the sum total of all human knowledge. Not everything is online and searchable. A great deal IS, but the further back you search in time, the more spotty the coverage grows.

While we, as a culture, are putting more and more content online, and more content is「born digital,」there is still content that’s off-line and will be unavailable for the foreseeable future. What’s more, copyright and policy issues will keep content tied up in unsearchable ways, while corporate issues will continue to affect the availability of information.

In particular, great researchers recognize that there are differences between search engines and information resources. The large, general-purpose, broad-range search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, etc.) provide superb coverage and the ability to supply depth on topics of special interest. They’re extremely good at covering web content, news, text resources, images, videos, maps, and so on. They are less good at providing in-depth search services in specialty topics (e.g., mathematics services, domain-specific providing context, etc.). The information landscape is not flat, nor are search engines completely universal in their coverage and competence. Each of the search engines offers a large number of different kinds of knowledge services to its users.

Due to local policy or legal restrictions on what kinds of knowledge can be served, search engines will always be slightly a bit different in their behavior from place to place. This isn’t just an odd property of the way that they’re built but rather a deep observation about the nature of social and political factors at work. Just as the content of encyclopedias was never consistent across national boundaries (for example, is Burr an American traitor or British hero?), so too will search tools necessarily serve different versions of knowledge depending on where the query is issued and what knowledge is received. Maps are currently different depending on where they’re viewed (contested national boundaries always look different from the other side of the border dispute), and this is true for contentious data sets as well. Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star illustrate this well in their book about how people organize knowledge about things: not only is medical knowledge organized differently from place to place, but its use and interpretations are as well.2 Different countries and cultures really do see the world differently, which is why looking at different versions of Wikipedia (by language) is such an interesting way to see the same topic from a different perspective (see chapter 7).

7. Understand how search interfaces work. Currently, search engines are getting better at answering questions. But at the moment, there are still questions that can’t be answered automatically (e.g., [who was Daniel Russell doctoral adviser]). Even though you could figure it out by doing your own searches, one step at a time, search engines can’t quite (yet!) put all the clues together to answer a question like that. (See the next chapter, though. Things are getting better all the time.)

The thing is, search engines don’t signal that they lack the knowledge to supply an answer, yet they don’t want to look bad, so they give a web-search set of results instead. That’s a great fallback position, but it’s also an important difference between an answer and a set of search results—one that’s worth noticing.

A skilled searcher knows that the text abstracts (aka snippets) for each web result are algorithmically generated without deep semantic processing. Effectively, the snippet composition system selects out fragments of text that score highly with respect to the interpreted form of the query. Those fragments are then concatenated together with ellipses, sometimes leading to an unintended interpretation when read as a summary of the page. If you know this about snippets, the correct reading is clear and straightforward—but this model isn’t explained, and isn’t widely understood by beginning searchers.

In other words, a searcher has to learn to interpret the subtle signals that are often quietly expressed in the interface design. Mostly (through iterative design and testing many variations on a theme) the designers of the search engine have arrived at a solution that works for most people in most cases. But for critical readings and complex research tasks, the search engine interface needs to be read with some skill and understanding. This includes attending to changes in the user interface as well as stepping in and questioning search results when an error seems possible. Remember, just because it shows up in a search engine result page doesn’t mean it’s true; it just means that you found something.

When you’re doing online research, you’re using a particular set of tools, such as search engines, databases, and their ilk. Each of these tools makes some things easy and other things almost impossible. An incredibly useful behavior to have is the habit of reading the user interface—that is, exploring the set of abilities that the tool gives you. For instance, can you sort these results by date or only by location? Is it possible to search over all the data or only parts of it? Spending a few minutes when you first start using a tool is incredibly useful; it will tell you what kinds of things are possible and what ones are just super hard. Spending that time to learn is worth the investment because sooner or later, you well may need to use that ability to find something.

Skilled searchers ask good questions that match the capabilities of the search engine. Searchers need to be sophisticated about what they are asking and thus what kind of answer to expect; the world is complicated, and not all simple questions have simple answers. For example, when was the USS Constitution built? The keel was laid on November 1, 1794. The ship was first launched on September 20, 1797 (but it accidentally stopped short of the water). It finally landed in the water and was commissioned on October 21, 1797. Even simple questions can have unexpectedly complex answers.

The increasing sophistication in representing world knowledge online also implies that asking the right questions will become more of a skill. A common error made among beginning searchers is to pose queries that have a built-in bias, a kind of leading question. A question that「leads the witness」wouldn’t be allowed in a courtroom and shouldn’t be in your research queries either. This is fairly common among K–12 students who don’t yet understand the basics of web search and often frame their questions with built-in assumptions. In cases like this, you need to know that the results are ordered by rank depending on the terms in the query. Take the following query:

[is the average length of an octopus 25 inches?]

It will give web links in the search results page that look right, but there’s an assumption within the query—that is, that octopuses actually are, on average, 25 inches in length. The web search results will be a bit misleading because there are so many positive hits that mention the terms「octopus」and「25 inches」on the same page. In this case, the search engine doesn’t really understand the question, but gives pages that best match the query, with its biases built in.

8. They read boldly yet carefully. Just as with the skill of reading snippets today, reading the answers generated by search engines carefully is an essential skill, especially when learning new user interface idioms that come into play. For example, for a simple question like [what are the languages of Eritrea], the answer will be displayed as「Eritrean Official Languages: Tigrigna, English, Arabic,」even though six other languages (with large, distinct populations) are also spoken there. If you miss the word「official」in the answer, you’ll expect the answer to match your question and will miss the one million Tigre-speaking people of the country.

Careful reading includes more than just the text on the results; it also includes the little clues that you’re given in the interface. For instance, if you do the query [how many states in India], you’ll see that there are (as of 2018) twenty-nine states, although there are several sites that claim there are twenty-eight states. Reading carefully, you’ll see that the latest state, Telangana, was formed in 2014 (websites that haven’t been updated since then have it wrong). But there are also seven「union territories,」which aren’t quite states, but are regions that are ruled directly by the union government (central government).

Reading boldly just means that you do NOT let yourself be intimidated by scary-looking titles, big words, or content that seems too complicated. Using a couple of online research tools, you can read just about anything.

How can I read it and understand what’s going on in complex texts? I have a two-step process for making this understandable.

First, I read through the article, searching for terms and concepts that I don’t understand. I look up these terms, usually by opening new tabs with the searches, both so I won’t lose my place in the original article and have several pages open for reference. My friend and colleague at Stanford, Sam Wineburg, calls this method「lateral reading,」which emphasizes understanding the gestalt by pursuing multiple searches in parallel.3

Second, it often helps to simplify the text into a form that I understand. That is, I go sentence by sentence (or paragraph by paragraph) rewriting the article in language that I can comprehend. This is a bit slow, but it frequently really helps reduce complicated language into something you can understand. Don’t be intimidated by complex language. Be a bold reader!

9. They check their work. Checking your research work seems obvious, but I often see people who do NOT check what they’ve found. One useful way to check your own work is to try to find a different answer. (This is a great way to overcome your own confirmation bias by trying to subvert your own research!) Just imagine that you’re now working for an adversary, trying to prove that your other self’s research is wrong and/or incompetent. How reliable are the sources that you’re using as the basis for your findings? Is that set of sources really up to date? And can your imaginary adversary reproduce your research? Checking your work is a great idea—both in sixth-grade math and especially the grown-up world of real online research.

10. They validate the resources that they find and use. That is, great researchers make it habit to check that their sources are credible, consistent with other sources, and accurate. Credible sources have a track record, give citations to other work (so you can check on their work), and even admit to errors. Beware the online resource that never admits to errors, and value ones that do. Newspapers and journals really should have a regular errata or update section where they correct blunders and mistakes that they’ve made. Similarly, professionals always check the date of publication; an encyclopedia from twenty years ago might have previously been accurate, but much of the contents will probably be out of date.

11. They know when to stop searching. It’s really easy to just keep searching, following leads from one interesting topic to the next. That’s why it’s important to be clear about what question(s) you’re trying to answer. It’s OK to refine the question—but keep track of what you’re trying to do. Stay on topic—or at least recognize that you’re now working on a new and different question. That’s OK too, but when you’ve found an answer to your research question, pause, check your work, and stop.

Attitudes of Great Researchers

The behaviors in this list are things that great researchers do in their searching. But there’s also something else I’ve noticed about good researchers: it’s not just the search skills they have, but the way that they approach these research questions. These people have an attitude. More precisely, they share a bunch of attitudes about their searching. And when I say「attitude,」I don’t just mean that they’re punkish thugs with a swaggering attitude problem but rather that they have a particular mental outlook—a way of approaching their research that makes them productive, efficient, and accurate.

These common attitudes are as follows.

1. Resilience. One of the important differences between a merely OK researcher and a great one is that essential attitude of being resilient in the face of change. Since things change constantly, and since there’s not much we can do about it, being able to compensate—that is, be resilient, work around setbacks, and find another way to accomplish your goal—is a key defining attitude for great researchers. Psychologists have identified some of the factors that make you resilient: a positive attitude, a dose of optimism, an ability to limit your disappointment when things go wrong, and the ability to see failure as useful feedback.

Resilience is the attitude of being willing to take on something that seems tough with the confidence that you’ll succeed and overcome any difficulties.

2. Persistent. If being resilient is the ability to gracefully recover from difficulties, being persistent is the attitude of trying over and over again. The best combination is being persistently resilient. The trick is to know when to stop being persistent because you’re not getting anywhere.

Perhaps most of all, a persistent researcher is one who isn’t frightened when they find something that’s complicated. (I see this a lot. When someone is searching and finds some results that are slightly mathematical, they’ll drop the whole thing as if it were covered in fire ants. Don’t be that person.)

Persistence is also the attitude of being willing to take on something that seems tough with the confidence that you’ll succeed and overcome any difficulties—and then, keep at it.

3. Curious. Of course, the way to know more stuff about a domain is to be curious about things in that area. Curiosity is the motivation to find out more about something. At the end of the day, this is what’s going to matter. People who are curious about the world generally know more about it. (They’re usually self-teachers who can’t help themselves.) While curiosity is particularly strong in humans, we’re not born knowing how to satisfy our curiosity; that’s a skill set you really need to acquire. The important attitudinal difference is not just about being curious but also being able to do something about it. Curious searchers go deep and wide—they are typically persistent and resilient—and as a side effect of their curiosity, they generally just know more about the world.

4. Abstract thinkers. One of the basic problems I see in beginning researchers is the tendency to see only the specifics in what they’re doing. Thinking in abstractions is the ability to work out not JUST the concrete details of the research topic but patterns in what you’re searching for more generally as well.

For example, when doing some research about the eating habits of a particular kind of bird, you might find it helpful to search for the eating habits of that genus of bird rather than just the species. Abstraction thinking means that you’re looking for the patterns that apply broadly instead of simply zeroing in on the details.

Penguins, such as the chinstrap penguin, typically eat krill, small fish, and other crustaceans. Another penguin, the king penguin, eats primarily fish, but not krill—and oddly enough, also small stones. Thinking abstractly about this makes you wonder if this is true for all penguins. Do they all consume stones? A curious searcher can quickly find out that this is true for more than just king penguins; it applies also to Adélie, African, gentoo, Magellanic, and yellow-eyed penguins. The「abstraction step」was to think about the whole category rather than just the one particular kind of penguin.

Another step of abstraction is to think about birds in general. Do other types of birds also swallow stones as they eat?4

5. Learn from mistakes while searching. When you’re looking things up, stuff goes wrong all the time in the way that you’re searching. It could be something simple—your search isn’t specific enough—or it finds something that’s not quite right, and you have to modify it. Usually, learning from your mistakes means identifying what went wrong in your use of the search tools and then remembering that lesson for the next time that you do this kind of research. In this way, people who search a lot learn not just from their successes but also from their mistakes. They think about what worked—and what didn’t work—as a way to constantly improve their searching. Even better, when you learn from your mistakes, you can think about the errors of your way more abstractly and understand how that kind of error can be seen in other search cases.

6. Constantly learn about the world. The good-news, bad-news story about doing online research is that everything changes all the time. Not only do the tools you use to search change, but the underlying data you want to search changes constantly as new databases come online and older content vanishes. If you’re constantly learning as you search, you’re learning a good deal about the topic along the way. Consequently, an important attitude to have is the willingness (and commitment) to stay up to date on your topic as things change. Find a way to make learning part of your daily (or at least weekly) routine. This is true of the internet age in general, but is especially true if you want to keep being a good researcher.

7. Focus. One of the things I’ve noticed in my own studies is that the closer you look at something (almost anything), the more you’ll discover that darn near everything is interesting if you take the time to look carefully. You just have to appreciate the interestingness that’s all around you! Naturally, with all that online information easily accessible, it’s all too easy to get lost and spend your whole day in an interesting, unquestionably fascinating yet useless rathole. A key to success is the ability to keep your focus in mind, and not get lost in all the fascinating and sparkly bits. (This is a bit of the opposite of being curious; but if curiosity expands your mind, it’s focus that brings the results home so you can get something done at the end of the day.) And this is the reason I write down my research questions: to remind myself of what it is I’m researching. It’s a way to externalize your attention to the target of your research.

Rules of Thumb for Asking Good Questions

We’ve seen some common behaviors and some of the attitudes of great researchers. In addition to all this, there’s the skill of asking good research questions to begin with. You’ve probably heard that「there are no bad questions,」but there are definitely better and worse questions. As an example, here’s an almost-useless question that you can ask, even though you shouldn’t expect a good answer: Who was the best baseball player of all time? You can ask it, but be prepared for a long discussion about what「best」means in baseball.

Here’s my list of the ways I see great researchers asking good questions.

1. Think to yourself, What else could this mean? In other words, how else could someone interpret your question? Simple questions often come with a lot of cultural baggage built in to the framing of the question. Something like「When is the first train on Monday?」might vary depending on whether or not Monday is a holiday. For a deeper research question—something like「What did Alexander Hamilton accomplish in his lifetime?」—the answer will vary a great deal depending on who’s asking it and who’s expecting the answer. A description of Hamilton’s life given by a historian will be different than that given by fan of the Broadway musical Hamilton. This is true even for something as simple as a boiled egg. The answer to「How should I boil an egg?」will vary on the details of what you mean. Are you a poached lightly kind of person or more of a hard-boiled fan? The details of what a question really means really matter.

2. Does this question work for everywhere on earth or just near where I am? Remember that easy questions often assume a particular location. The answer to「What kind of energy efficient light bulb should I buy?」will change a lot if you’re in Europe, India, or the United States. This rule of thumb lifts you up from your localized thinking and into a different frame of reference—one that helps to clarify the way that your research question can be asked. It’s the geolocation version of the previous question.

3. Constantly fact-check. Get into the habit of constantly asking if this thing that you’re reading (or hearing or watching) is internally consistent (for instance, whether the numbers add up) and consistent with what you already know.

I find myself noticing things, dates, people, and places. I’m constantly asking the question,「Does what they’re saying fit in with everything else I know?」I’m also asking,「Is this consistent with itself?」You’d be surprised at the number of times things just don’t add up—I mean that literally (such as when the percentages of things don’t add to 100 percent) and figuratively (as when the basic facts and assumptions in the piece are just plain wrong; I read an article the other day that had the population of the United States just wrong. Sometimes you just have to know some basic facts about the world, such as in 2018, the population of the United States is around 325 million, or knowing that sound doesn’t travel in space (so you can’t hear a spaceship blowing up, no matter how often you’ve heard it in science fiction movies), or knowing that Shakespeare lived during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (which is why he wrote using an Elizabethan voice).

This back-of-the-brain, constant fact-checking becomes important when you’re asking a question. If you know that around 17 percent of the US population is Hispanic in 2018, asking a question about the「100 million Hispanic people in the United States」is seriously off base to start. (That is, 17 percent of 325 million is about 55 million, so that frame is off by almost a factor of two.)

Whenever I read a news item or see a story reported on video, I find myself quietly adding up the statistics given (do they add up to 100 percent?) and cross checking the various pieces of data as presented. These kinds of sanity checks let you spot all kinds of errors in data, even when presented on well-meaning news channels.5

4. When your research question covers a long period of time, consider making a timeline to keep track of everything. Many questions can cover a large number of events or extend over a long period of time. (Take this sample research question with lots of actions over time:「What were the events that led to the collapse of the energy company Enron in 2001?」) Great researchers not only fact-check constantly but also try to put events into a kind of timeline as a way of both keeping track of events and checking to see if the events make sense. This kind of timeline tracking not only helps you understand what happened in time but also why particular events happened as they did.

And in particular, having a timeline helps you to see what kinds of questions you should be asking, if only to fill in the gaps in the story line or if you don’t understand why an event did NOT happen. Even a simple timeline makes these kinds of relationships apparent.

5. Look for the context that gives meaning to information. As we saw above, creating「context」is something that great researchers do all the time. When you’re framing your question, it’s useful to think about what other information will help you understand what you seek. That is, a great question is one that comes along with other questions in parallel for every question you ask, you also should be thinking about how to find the context. You’re not just asking what is true but also what else you need to know.

20 The Future of Online Search: Why the Research Skills You Learn Today Will Continue to Be Useful in the Future

Where will online research be in five to ten years and what skills do you need to know now? Will those skills still be useful in ten years? Answer: there seems to be no end to the need for basic knowledge. No matter how skilled the online tools are, we’ll still need to understand what’s going on.

When I started this book, it was based on the premise that people are curious and want to know more about the world. Along the way, I’ve investigated many different curious questions, and learned how to do this kind of online research using a variety of resources and methods. We’re living in a time of fast technology development and change. So an obvious question at this point might be, How well will those skills last?

After all, what’s the point of learning all these skills and somewhat-hidden repositories of information? You might believe that in the future, Google will just give you the answer in response to your questions. So what will change over the next couple years? What skills are worth learning and practicing?1 (To put it figuratively, what should you learn that won’t become as useless as a screen door on a submarine?)

I’ve lived long enough to remember the world pre-Google. I know that might border on the inconceivable, but it’s true; I was born before the internet, email, cell phone, or Google. Over the course of my life, doing online research has gone through astonishing change; the omnipresence of fast online search has changed everything—from writing a PhD thesis to settling questions raised in pubs over beer. (For one technology to make THAT broad of a change is truly phenomenal.)

This is a question we can think about by looking back for historical precedent.

If you cast your mind back to 1993, the first real search engine was Excite, which opened for business in that year. There were a few small search tools before then (though not quite full search engines in the way that we think about them now)—systems like Archie, Veronica, and the World-Wide-Web-Wanderer—but they were all fairly limited in what they could do. Just as important, the web wasn’t that large. Online content was mostly created by hobbyists and scientists. There just wasn’t that much good stuff to search.

Then the tide shifted; more content started becoming available online, and with real content came the realization that people really DID want to discover what that information had to tell them. And with that shift came the importance of search engines.

There were lots of different kinds of search engines early on—just after Excite came Lycos, Hotbot, and Alta Vista—and all were pretty good, but when Google search technology came online, it was clear that they were using hopelessly inadequate methods, and the research world had gone through an informational seismic event. Fairly quickly, using Google to search became the default online research method. Microsoft had its「Live」search engine, which was later updated by Bing. In all cases, modern search engines now use more up-to-date algorithms that take many factors into account when rank ordering the results of a search.

Early on, though, you could see that the world wasn’t going to be as simple as what Larry Page and Sergey Brin had hoped for; there really was no way they were going to build a system that would crawl and index「all the world’s knowledge,」and then offer it up through a single interface. The divisions started early: Google Scholar broke off the「scholarly literature」part, and offered its own user interface and index. (It took another ten years before Google Scholar content was available through regular Google searches.) Now, Google’s Images, Maps, Patents, News, Shopping, and Books all have their own access points, and—crucially—their own sharing of content with the main search engine.

For instance, the ability to search by image on Google was announced in 2011, and it is a completely remarkable tool that changes the way we search and how we think about images in general.

But you can’t search Google Images for images from Google Street View. And contrariwise, you can’t use regular Google web search to find any of the images in the Google Cultural Institute. (I mean, there is a way, and I can show you how, but you have to know how to do it; it’s not obvious.)

Search engines try to「blend」all the information silos together by showing a search results page that has the best-of data from each siloed kind-of-content area. Search for [Disneyland], and you’ll see images, news, and reviews all collected together. But there are many more kinds of information that could be shown. What about 3D models of the Sleeping Beauty Castle? What of videos made in the park? You can find them, but you have to search on a video site (such as YouTube), and you can’t search by geographic location—at least not yet.

My point is that we, as an online culture, are rapidly moving into the information retrieval past; instead of a perfectly flat and universally accessible universe of information resources, the world of information remains obstinately clumpy and segregated. We once had a dream that a single system would integrate all our information resources into a single master repository. The holy grail was that we’d only need to search in one place—in one master catalog, as the one place to find everything. There would be one ring to rule them all, and one index to find them.

In retrospect, we should have known that wouldn’t work; there are too many resources that are held (i.e., owned) by people who either don’t want the information out there or want to make money from giving access to the information. You can’t blame them—it’s a way to capitalize on their creative work—but it also means that the information world won’t ever provide even simple access to all content.

In the old days, you had to know what resources were available in order to do your research. And that’s true once again—except that now we have a great tool (search engines) that will help you find those resources and then let you go down each of the rabbit holes in turn. That is, only if you know how, and if you know what tools, methods, and buckets of content exist. It might not occur to you to search for the data from the census of the United States (but you can at census.gov), or that you could possibly find your grandparents’ immigration records (as I did), unless you first know that such a search would tap into online data that’s been assembled, curated, and put online for your search.

By the same token, though, we now also have tools that can help us look at information in new and sometimes previously unthinkable ways. Again, IF you know how. Here are a few examples.

Figure 20.1

Creating a timeline is fairly simple, if you know which tool to use. A simple query on Wolfram|Alpha gives a nice timeline of the life spans of three famous people of the eighteenth century.

Want to see a chart of the lifetimes of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson? That’s easy! Use the Wolfram|Alpha search engine and give the query:2

[George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Francisco de Goya]

In response, Wolfram|Alpha creates a timeline with each person’s dates, side by side, showing their lives with some context. Of course, you can add in other people to see how they relate to your topic of interest.

In a couple seconds, you’ll have a really nice timeline diagram showing you when they all lived.3

Or want to get the elevation profile of an east-to-west path over the Himalayas? Use Google Earth, draw a path, and then click on「Elevation profile.」

This is a fantastic tool, but you need to know about it. It’s even better if you know the skill of how to find such a system to give you the data in the form you need.

For example, you might need to know that in the United States, the .gov top-level domain refers to government sites (and you need to know that it’s .go in other countries). Likewise, if you’re looking for reliable statistical data, you should know that there are a number of places where you can find such tables; the Bureau of Labor Statistics has vast quantities of data, as does census.gov and the German Research Foundation’s re3data.org site.4 Google has its own data collection at the Google Public Data Explorer, and Amazon maintains its Open Data Registry.5

Figure 20.2

If you know what various tools can do, it’s straightforward to find the answers to complex questions, such as making this vertical profile across the top of Mount Everest to get a sense for what the topography of the Himalayas is like.

Overall, the web has made more information resources closer at hand. That is, what you seek is faster to find and quicker to gain access. Here I mean「closer」in the literal sense of when a book is physically closer in the library, but also in the figurative sense of when it’s faster to get to the text, just as if it were closer to you. Lots of research shows that「closer」resources are understood more deeply and used more frequently by people in libraries and via online resources.6 Putting things far away is death to that text, as is making something harder or slower to find.

This also has given us the illusion that anything that’s off-line (or more than two minutes away in time as distance) isn’t useful, or at least isn’t used as much. This is certainly the case for online resources, where a delay of as little as 0.1 seconds can make a substantial difference in the likelihood of access and reading.7

As our ability to do online research has grown, we’ve come to realize five deep truths.

1. There’s more stuff online than you might imagine or know about—but it’s not all uniformly accessible. One of the surprises (and delights) of my work has been learning about the vast quantities of information that’s available on an immense variety of topics. Want to learn about different diseases of abalone (fungal? viral? bacterial?)? It’s simple to do. How about dressage style of the sixteenth century?8 Sure. Not a problem. Want to see nineteenth-century records from Ellis Island immigration? That’s simple too. There is just an amazing amount of content online.

In other words, the kinds of research that used to be a huge hassle are now fairly straightforward as more content becomes available. This stuff is either「born digital」content, or becomes available as older content is scanned and indexed. That’s how you can learn about sixteenth-century Italian dressage; the Google Books project scanned and then indexed the original text.

One of the consequences of this is that new content is popping up all the time. New websites appear minute by minute (there were 1.3 million new website domain names registered in the first three months of 2017, up 3.7 percent from 2016).9 New online applications let us see content in new ways (such as the InformationIsBeautiful.net site, which specializes in this kind of seeing-in-new-ways data, or Google Earth VR, which lets you fly through a 3D model of the Earth, including many city building landscapes).10

And the side effect of that is that you can’t really keep up to date on what’s newest and greatest in your field. Instead, you’ll have to keep your eyes open and periodically search for new content in your area of interest. We have shifted into an age of information triage—separating out what’s useful and important from the stuff that isn’t.

Yet all this easy availability isn’t uniform for all new content. Often that information is in silos that are owned by someone who wants to make some money off that information. That’s a fine thing to do, but sometimes journals, newspapers, and other publications are behind paywalls; the content is frequently indexed and therefore searchable, but you can’t get to it without paying.

2. There’s more different KINDS of stuff than you might have thought about. Videos, virtual reality environments, 3D models, data sets, spreadsheets, presentations, blogs, vlogs, and 3D-printable objects—the number of different kinds of online content is astounding, and the number of different kinds of content continues to grow. This means not only does a literate person need to have a comprehensive understanding of the areas of information that’s available but also an understanding of the different ways that information can be stored, indexed, accessed, and read.

What makes this complex is that there’s no single authoritative news feed or information stream that will tell you about all the new types of data objects (and tools to use them).

In practice, great online researchers usually follow a number of online newsletters (to track the introduction of new content types, along with collections that pull them together). Given the number of products that come and go, I tend to only look at new data resources once there’s a large enough collection of them to do a scan and see if it’s worth me spending my time to evaluate them. If you track down every new introduction, you’ll never get anything done.

3. Online information often doesn’t come with much context. You have to supply your own or know how to find it. Just as important, you have to understand—DEEPLY understand—that context is just as critical as the information you seek. (As an example, it’s not much use to know that the French and Indian War was held in 1754–1763—unless you also understand that it was part of a much larger global war, the Seven Years’ War, which involved not just the nascent United States but also Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Russia, and Canada.)
