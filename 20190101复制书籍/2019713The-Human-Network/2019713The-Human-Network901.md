9 • GLOBALIZATION: OUR CHANGING NETWORKS

Dave Baun cycled the rural roads that cut through the hills not far from his home in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Halfway around the world, Liisa Grace rode the many beautiful hills outside of Adelaide, Australia, known for their wines and the occasional kangaroo. It is hard to find two places as far from each other, so it was unlikely that their rides would ever intersect. Nonetheless, Liisa and Dave managed to meet.

Strava is a fitness app that allows a cyclist to track each ride, storing detailed data including average speed, distance, elevation, wattage, and calories burned. If cycling is your thing, such an app is a must-have. It helps you see where others are riding and makes it easy for you to find the best routes no matter where you are. It also allows you to see how others have performed on the same or similar routes. Strava helps match you to others with similar cycling habits so that you can compare fitness and track your progress, and send each other encouragement.

In 2014 Liisa sent Dave a request to follow him on Strava. He agreed. After exchanging kudos and pleasantries on Strava, they eventually connected via social media and deepened their friendship through long-distance conversations. Trips to Australia followed, and by 2016 they were married. Dave had proposed by riding a carefully planned route that spelled「Marry Me Liisa」when viewed on the Strava map. 1

Platforms such as Strava are tremendous inventions that can bring knowledge and joy to our lives. Elderly who would be otherwise isolated can stay connected with friends and family via social media. 2

Increased connectivity has also had widespread and unprecedented economic impact.

If you are a fisherman in a small village in rural China, India, or Africa, how do you choose where to sell your fish? It used to be that you had to just guess and go to a market and take whatever price you could get. Because markets were far apart and held roughly at the same time, it was not feasible to drive from market to market looking for a good price. But now you can call friends and acquaintances to find out what prices you might expect where. If there are too many sellers at one market and too few at another, then this helps steer a seller to the market that needs more fish. Does it make a difference? Yes, connectivity is an enormous equalizer. Rob Jensen looked at markets in southern India before and after cell phones became available. 3 Before cell service, prices for sardines would vary dramatically; for instance, the price in one market was 4 rupees/kilo while in another in the same region it was more than 10 rupees/kilo for the same type and quality of fish on the same day. Fish were rotting in one market even as there was a shortage in another. Typically the difference in prices across markets was around 8 rupees/kilo. After cell service came to the region, the difference dropped to less than 2 rupees/kilo.

Advances in technology are a mixed blessing, as they transform the world in which we live. 4 They have led to the most rapid decrease in extreme poverty that the world has ever seen. But they have also displaced labor and increased the premium to higher education, thus increasing inequality. Technological changes are also allowing people to form and maintain relationships at greater distances and to be increasingly selective in whom they choose to be friends with. Understanding how trends in technology affect our networks requires understanding how and why those networks form.

Network Formation

Examining how networks form is what first got me hooked on studying networks. Why do we end up in different positions in networks? Do we form the「right」networks — ones that are best for our community or society? 5

We have already discussed some important aspects of network formation, from the fact that centrality begets centrality, to the many forces that push us to form networks with strong homophily. But there is still another aspect of how networks form that is fundamental to understanding the consequences of technological forces on network formation.

Externalities have played a central role in all of our discussions thus far: from vaccinations to financial contagions to social learning. They make networks both interesting and important to understand. So it should come as no surprise that externalities are key to understanding network formation.

Many of the externalities that play a role in network formation are positive ones. I will start with a personal example. To help pay for college, throughout high school and college, I worked various jobs. Most were low skilled — I got them because they required almost no training and I was available. I worked as a stock boy in a local store, I worked at a warehouse unloading trucks, I worked as a night watchman at a local medical clinic, I filed papers at a local bank. The pay was generally minimum wage and I did not have any more skills when I left the jobs than when I started them. The summer before my senior year in college that changed. My undergraduate advisor knew a former colleague who was heading up a research team at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange — a futures market. My advisor’s connection got me an interview and ultimately a job. Not only was the pay better, but I learned an enormous amount in a short time. That experience of seeing how markets work, grow, and change, as well as where they fall short, was important in my decision to become an economist. This was a hugely positive externality: my advisor’s friendship with a former colleague was critical in my getting the job and much more.

Now, let’s rewind many years. Was my advisor’s decision to form that friendship with his colleague at all influenced by the chance that, years later, it would make a difference to me? Of course not.

The point is that our relationships result in information and access that can be valuable to others around us, and yet those positive benefits to others play at most a minor role in our decisions to form and maintain relationships. For example, as we saw with social learning, the more varied and wider-ranging our connections are, the faster our communities learn and the more informed they become. However, when we form friendships we don’t take all of that into account. When I go to a conference or read a book, it is generally because I am interested in the topic and want to learn more about it, not necessarily because I anticipate that I might eventually pass that knowledge along to someone else. If we all were choosing our relationships in order to improve communication and knowledge in our communities we would engage with more people.

This is an example of a more general tension that exists between individual incentives to form relationships and what is best for a society, the subject of my first research on networks together with economist Asher Wolinsky. The rampant externalities in network settings make it common for people to end up forming networks that are suboptimal: people are not accounting for the full impact of their relationships and in many situations everyone would be made better off with a different network. 6

This applies not only to how many relationships and interactions people have, but also to how diverse they are. People who go against tendencies of homophily can help overcome some of the barriers that we have seen homophily impose. They enrich the informational content of their community. But bridging gaps and interacting with people who are fundamentally different can be both time-consuming and difficult, resulting in a general tendency in network formation. When there are positive externalities from having more connections, people tend to underinvest in the quantity and diversity of their relationships. If we all formed more relationships, and more diverse relationships, this would enhance both the richness of information in our society and its circulation, and we would all benefit. 7

By the same token, with negative externalities just the opposite can happen — people have more relationships than would be socially optimal. An easy example is the frequency with which people have unprotected sexual interactions, thereby transmitting STDs. Having more unprotected sex with more partners does not just endanger direct partners, but as we have seen in Chapter 3, it also increases the conductivity of the network — which has a multiplicative effect on contagion.

With these basic tendencies in mind, the impact of technology comes more clearly into focus. There are two major ways in which technology changes incentives to form relationships. 8 First, it makes it easier to form relationships and to maintain them at a distance. This is generally good news for situations with positive externalities: technology helps people form more relationships than they would otherwise. Given that people tend to underinvest in social relationships, anything that greases the wheel of interaction can be helpful. But there is another impact of technology that comes with a downside. Advances in technology make it easier to connect with people and organizations with views similar to one’s own. This can lead to greater homophily. It can be wonderful, as in the story of Dave and Liisa, but it also can lead to more fragmentation in our networks. Niche media outlets and news services that cater to specific interests and views can operate, biasing information flows. People can shift their relationships to form tighter echo chambers engaging more with like-minded others who reinforce narrow perspectives. 9

Let’s have a look at some of these forces in action. I will start with economic globalization: technology has made international trade easier, and we have a much denser global network than ever before. This has created a positive externality: the world is far more peaceful now than at any time in its history.

Trading Networks: Make Trade Not War

「The secret of politics? Make a good treaty with Russia.」

 —  OTTO VON BISMARCK

Otto von Bismarck — after wars with Denmark, Austria, and France ended in 1871 — managed to unite German states around Prussia. He then started on an early attempt at globalization, with a stated goal of forming alliances to maintain peace. His triple alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy, and nonaggression pact with Russia, led to a brief period of relative peace, at least in Europe, which unraveled and eventually erupted in the extreme violence of the First World War.

It was not until after the savagery of the Second World War that peace, by historical standards, would emerge. The average chance that two countries were at war in any given year over the last seven decades was ten times less than it was in the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries! In spite of wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Congo, Kuwait, and Iraq, among others, the incidence of interstate war has dropped dramatically by almost any measure.

Figure 9.1: Wars per pair of countries by year, 1820–2000, from Jackson and Nei (2015).

The average number of wars per pair of countries per year from 1820 to 1949 was .00059, while from 1950 to 2000 it was .00006. This drop by a factor of 10 is pictured in Figure 9.1. 10

So what accounts for the dramatic increase in peace in our lifetime? This is a question that I investigated with economist Stephen Nei, a former student of mine.

The alliances made by Bismarck and many of those up through the Second World War, especially those between potential foes, were alliances of convenience. They were not cemented by deeper economic ties. International trade was growing, but most countries still had very few trading partners on whom their economies depended.

International trade grew exponentially through the second half of the twentieth century, not just in absolute terms but actually as a fraction of the world’s total production. The history of international trade is pictured in Figure 9.2. 11

Trade grew as many countries’ incomes rose, and burgeoning middle classes could afford a wider range of goods. It was greatly facilitated by falling shipping costs resulting from changes in maritime technology and the expansion of ports that could handle container shipping.

Figure 9.2: World trade as a percentage of world GDP. World trade is exports plus imports, so you can divide by half to get an idea of level of exports or imports.

Table 9.1: Average number of trading partners per country. At least one country has to trade at least .5 percent of its GDP with the other for the two of them to be considered trade partners (respectively .1 percent). From Jackson and Nei (2015).

It is not just the total amount of trade that has grown, but more important countries now each have many more major trading partners, and their arrangements are more likely to last a decade. Table 9.1 shows how many trading partners countries have on average and how that has increased over time, from Bismarck’s era through the early 1970s. The number has grown even more rapidly since the 1970s.

The key is that trade networks and alliance networks have moved largely in tandem.

If we look from the end of the Napoleonic Wars (starting with 1816) through 1950, each country averaged 2.5 alliances at a time. Moreover, those alliances were ephemeral. Any given alliance at any moment had just over a two-thirds chance of existing five years later. Most were marriages of convenience, not anchored by trade, and were easily disrupted when times got tough. 12 After 1951, the number of alliances per country grew by a factor of more than 4 to 10.5. Even more important, these alliances were quite steady: any given alliance now had a 95 percent chance of still existing five years later. 13 Figure 9.3 pictures what some of these networks looked like at key points in time.

Both trade and military alliances became much denser and more stable over time, coinciding with the dramatic decrease in wars. Moreover, most wars that have occurred in the past three decades have involved low-trade countries on at least one if not both sides of the conflict. Major trade partners simply do not appear on opposite sides of a war.

Countries with an extra ten trading partners are half as likely to be at war at any given moment; and pairs of countries that had a one standard deviation higher level of trade with each other have a 17 times lower chance of being at war with each other than the average pair. 14

We cannot be sure that the striking correlations between trade and peace are causal. We don’t have controlled experiments with parallel worlds, one with trade and another without, to see what would happen. There are also many other things that have changed over time: the international political landscape, the number of democracies, and the presence of nuclear weapons. All of these changes are likely contributors to our more peaceful world. But as I found together with Stephen Nei, 15 the timing of conflicts and other details suggests that none of these other factors can really explain all of what we have seen, and it seems that denser trade networks are playing a major role in generating peace.

Figure 9.3: The evolution of military alliances: We see the dramatic increase in the density of the recent network compared to historical ones.

Given the importance of world peace, even if we cannot be certain of causation, it is worth knowing the correlations and using our common sense. Two countries that have close economic ties have much less incentive to fight each other, and more incentive to protect each other. The European Union has led to the most peaceful time in Europe’s history by a huge margin.

If one wants a recipe for lowering the incidence of wars in Africa and the Middle East, the message is clear: grow the economies and the regional trade networks, and especially promote trade between potential adversaries. It is not an easy task, but it is the obvious one. Signing repeated treaties, even with powerful third parties but without serious trade, has been tenuous at best.

As we have seen dangerous cycles of isolationist tendencies over the centuries, this lesson about trade networks and peace might be one of the more important ones in these pages.

Wired: Increasing Homophily and Polarization

「Globalization means we have to re-examine some of our ideas, and look at ideas from other countries, from other cultures, and open ourselves to them. And that’s not comfortable for the average person.」

 —  HERBIE HANCOCK

There are signs that the increased polarization that much of the world is seeing (e.g., Figure 7.4) is not coincidental, but is related to the common forces that are increasing immobility and inequality in many places and also changing communication patterns. For example, one way to see how the Internet is changing politics is to trace when the Internet became available in different places and how the politics in those places were affected.

Anja Prummer did just this and examined how the availability of the Internet in regions within the U.S. affected how polarized their politics are. Using the congressional voting patterns of a district to estimate its polarization, Prummer estimates that when a locale has gone from having no Internet connection to complete Internet availability there is a 22 percent increase in the polarization of the district’s politics (all else being equal). 16

This is not evidence that having the Internet is what increased polarization. For instance, it could be that Internet availability was spurred by changes in the economic conditions of the area, which also affects polarization.

However, other studies have taken advantage of randomization in the way that the Internet became available in various places (for instance, due to changes in old rules governing right-of-way that affected where optic cable could be laid, or due to delays in regulatory changes that affected when the Internet made it to different regions). Studies based on these sorts of plausibly random factors affecting Internet rollout find significant evidence that the relationship is causal. For instance, Yphtach Lelkes, Gaurav Sood, and Shanto Iyengar (2015) find that increasing Internet access increases the following of partisan news and leads to more polarized politics. 17 Samuele Poy and Simone Schüller (2016) find that increased Internet availability significantly increased voter turnout and changed relative party shares, in a similar study of Internet deployment in Trento, Italy.

Polarization of beliefs is complex, and it would be wrong to blame only Internet access. Another technological force may also have played an important role. Cable television led to a proliferation of news sources some decades before the Internet came into being, and around the world people have been subject to a tug-of-war from differing ideologies for some decades. 18 The advent of cable enabled more targeted and ideologically based news outlets to reach people more cheaply at greater distances, and to reach populations that could sustain them. 19 This interacts with homophily — if a community of people all consume news from the same sources, and then talk to each other — the combination of limited inputs and echoes leads to stronger consensus within communities, and more divergent views across communities. Again, the homophily that so strongly defines our networks is a vital part of such polarization.

As we saw in Chapter 7, there is a difference between how quickly things like memes, ideas, and rumors can spread, and yet how slowly a person’s beliefs about complex and subjective topics change. This suggests that the sorts of changes that come with increased connectivity and homophily can energize people with already strong views rather than dramatically change people’s views. People gain confidence when others share similar views, and also tend to overestimate how many other people share their view. 20 The increased homophily can lead groups to deepen their resolve.

As we have seen, the more general consequences of increased homophily are wide and deep, including immobility and inequality.

Disruptions

Beyond increased connectivity and homophily, changes in networks can also be disruptive, as norms and cultures are ripped apart.

The last hundred years have seen the most rapid transition from rural to urban population in human history. Two centuries ago, only 3 percent of the world’s population was urban. By a century ago, it had risen to 15 percent, and by 1950 it made it to 30 percent. It hit 50 percent in 2008, and now sits at more than 54 percent, and rising. On its current trend, it will be above two thirds by mid-century.

Although that trend has slowed in parts of Europe and North America, partly because rural areas have little population left, it is accelerating in much of Asia and Africa.

It is not hard to figure out why this is happening: urban areas are where the jobs are. As agriculture shrinks as a contributor to the world economy, the advantages to living in proximity with many others when producing goods and services lead populations to agglomerate.

The relationship between how productive a country is and how urban it is is remarkable. Figure 9.4 shows the effect for a selection of countries so that their names are readable. The graph for all countries in the world is similar, just more crowded. The correlation between the productivity of a country and the urbanization rate is 72 percent over the data of all 179 countries in the data set. 21

Figure 9.4: The relation between urbanization and productivity: Selected countries from Asia, Europe, and North America. Great Britain and France lie on top of each other and so are difficult to discern. The GDP per capita is in thousands of dollars and the scale is logarithmic. Data from the World Development Index of the World Bank for 2014.

Of course, this does not mean that simply building cities will make a country richer. New and rapidly growing cities often come with slums and poverty. 22 But this correlation does tell us that the inevitable shifts in economies around the world are likely to be accompanied by increased urbanization. 23

Urban and rural populations have different network structures. In many rural areas around the world, people are often connected in tight communities, and rely on themselves, family, and friends for many if not most of their needs. With urbanization and increased market access, many needs are met through transactions rather than favors and cooperative production. This runs the spectrum from people growing their own food, to borrowing money.

A few decades ago, more than three quarters of all Chinese lived in the countryside. Now more than half live in urban areas. As the economy has shifted, so has the population. In addition to those living in cities, there are many who live in the countryside and work in the cities. 24 Such dramatic changes have torn many families apart.

For the hundreds of millions who follow Confucius, filial piety is one of the most important virtues. The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars is a classic text of folk stories by Guo Jujing from the Yuan dynasty that dramatize how children should act toward their elders — from fighting a tiger to save a father, to feeling a mother’s pain in one’s heart, to giving up a job to search for a lost mother. Here is one of the twenty-four:

W’ang Xi’ang of the Jin dynasty lost his mother early. His stepmother, named Zhu, was unloving toward him and unceasingly spoke ill of him before his father. Because of this he lost the love of his father also. His stepmother often liked to eat fresh fish, but one winter the cold froze [the river] to ice. Xi’ang loosened his clothes and lay on the ice to [melt it so he could] procure them. Suddenly the ice opened of itself and a pair of carp leapt out. He took them and returned to serve them to his stepmother. 25

With a growing aging population, many of whom have no pensions, support from children has become more important than ever. As the disruption in families has continued to rise, the state has even intervened. Various laws for respect of the elderly have been on the books for years, but they have recently been renewed and are now being enforced. For instance, the updated「Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly」26 includes:「Article XIII: Dependents shall fulfill the economic support for the elderly, the obligations of life care and spiritual comfort, care for the elderly’s special needs.」

In the wake of the law, there have been lawsuits. For instance, a few months after the new version of the law, a seventy-seven-year-old woman sued her daughter for neglecting her duties after the two had a fight. The court ruled in the mother’s favor, deciding not only that the daughter and her husband had to help support the mother financially, but also that the daughter had to visit her mother at least once every two months. Those might not be the most fun visits, but the message was clear.

We have seen similar effects in the Indian villages we studied. 27 Out of the seventy-five villages for which we mapped social networks, between 2007 and 2010, microfinance was introduced to forty-three but not the other thirty-two. The villages that got microfinance saw roughly an extra 15 percent drop in the density of their networks compared to the villages that did not get the microfinance. People started borrowing from the bank and less from their friends. This also had widespread spillovers. The advice network was similarly diminished. The spillover also affected people who did not participate in microfinance within the villages in which they could have gotten loans. Even connections between two people who decided not to participate in microfinance tended to disappear. So not only did the market exposure replace some relationships that we would expect it to, but it also led to an overall decrease in social activity within the villages.

These seismic shifts in networks, beyond the incremental ones, can be very disruptive when examining societies that have long relied on social and family ties for much of their support and culture. This is not to say that progress should stop. But it does say that large changes in where and/or how people live can upend networks, which can lead to difficulties for those who still rely on informal relationships for much of their support.

The More Things Change

Technology will continue to advance and reshape our networks. Humans have been rewired many times: by the printing press, letter writing, trains, the telegraph, overseas travel, the telephone, the Internet, and the advent of social media. Perhaps it is our arrogance that leads us to assume that the current changes in our lives are truly revolutionary and unique.

Nonetheless, the changes are real — as we saw with networks of trade and military alliances. Still, humans are predictable. Human networks are easily recognizable and have exhibited regularities for some time. In our social transformations we see「more」of many things: denser networks, more homophily, more polarization, faster movement of information and contagion. And, as we have learned, even small changes in connectedness can have big consequences. Even changes in the extent, rather than the shape, of our networks can have profound implications — for contagion, immobility, and polarization.
