Long-lasting learning

The world is complex! But our nine reasoning tools help us master and enjoy the complexity. Spanning fields of knowledge, the tools connect disparate facts and ideas and promote long-lasting learning.

An analogy for the value of connected knowledge is an infinite two-dimensional lattice of dots: a percolation lattice [21]. Every dot marks a piece of knowledge — a fact or an idea. Now add bonds between neighboring pieces of knowledge, with a probability 𝑝bond for each bond. The following figures show examples of finite lattices starting at 𝑝bond = 0.4. Marked in bold is the largest pbond = 0.40

cluster — the largest connected set of dots. As 𝑝bond increases, this cluster unifies an ever-larger fraction of the lattice of knowledge.

pbond = 0.40

pbond = 0.50

pbond = 0.55

pbond = 0.60

12% of lattice

39% of lattice

89% of lattice

91% of lattice

An infinite lattice might hold many infinite clusters, and 1

f∞

the measure analogous to the size of the largest cluster is the fraction of dots belonging to an infinite cluster. This fraction 𝑓∞ is, like the number of infinite clusters, zero until

p

𝑝bond reaches the critical probability 0.5. Then it rises 0

bond

0.5

1

above zero and, as 𝑝bond rises, eventually reaches 1.

For long-lasting learning, the pieces of knowledge should support each other through their connections. For when we remember a fact or use an idea, we activate connected facts and ideas and solidify them in our minds.
