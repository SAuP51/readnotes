# 0801. The Order in Chaos

IN THE MID-1960S, some ninety years old and in great need of money to live on, a Frenchwoman named Jeanne Calment made a deal with a forty-seven-year-old lawyer: she sold him her apartment for the price of a low monthly subsistence payment with the agreement that the payments would stop upon her death, at which point she would be carried out and he could move in.1 The lawyer must have known that Ms. Calment had already exceeded the French life expectancy by more than ten years. He may not have been aware of Bayes's theory, however, nor known that the relevant issue was not whether she should be expected to die in minus ten years but that her life expectancy, given that she had already made it to ninety, was about six more years.2 Still, he had to feel comfortable believing that any woman who as a teenager had met Vincent van Gogh in her father's shop would soon be joining van Gogh in the hereafter. (For the record, she found the artist「dirty, badly dressed, and disagreeable.」)

Ten years later the attorney had presumably found an alternative dwelling, for Jeanne Calment celebrated her 100th birthday in good health. And though her life expectancy was then about two years, she reached her 110th birthday still on the lawyer's dime. By that point the attorney had turned sixty-seven. But it was another decade before the attorney's long wait came to an end, and it wasn't the end he expected. In 1995 the attorney himself died while Jeanne Calment lived on. Her day of reckoning finally came on August 4, 1997, at the age of 122. Her age at death exceeded the lawyer's age at his death by forty-five years.

Individual life spans — and lives — are unpredictable, but when data are collected from groups and analyzed en masse, regular patterns emerge. Suppose you have driven accident-free for twenty years. Then one fateful afternoon while you're on vacation in Quebec with your spouse and your in-laws, your mother-in-law yells,「Look out for that moose!」and you swerve into a warning sign that says essentially the same thing. To you the incident would feel like an odd and unique event. But as the need for the sign indicates, in an ensemble of thousands of drivers a certain percentage of drivers can be counted on to encounter a moose. In fact, a statistical ensemble of people acting randomly often displays behavior as consistent and predictable as a group of people pursuing conscious goals. Or as the philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote in 1784,「Each, according to his own inclination follows his own purpose, often in opposition to others; yet each individual and people, as if following some guiding thread, go toward a natural but to each of them unknown goal; all work toward furthering it, even if they would set little store by it if they did know it.」3

According to the Federal Highway Administration, for example, there are about 200 million drivers in the United States.4 And according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in one recent year those drivers drove a total of about 2.86 trillion miles.5 That's about 14,300 miles per driver. Now suppose everyone in the country had decided it would be fun to hit that same total again the following year. Let's compare two methods that could have been used to achieve that goal. In method 1 the government institutes a rationing system employing one of the National Science Foundation's supercomputing centers to assign personal mileage targets that meet each of the 200 million motorists' needs while maintaining the previous annual average of 14,300. In method 2 we tell drivers not to stress out over it and to drive as much or as little as they please with no regard to how far they drove the prior year. If Uncle Billy Bob, who used to walk to work at the liquor store, decides instead to log 100,000 miles as a shotgun wholesaler in West Texas, that's fine. And if Cousin Jane in Manhattan, who logged most of her mileage circling the block on street-cleaning days in search of a parking space, gets married and moves to New Jersey, we won't worry about that either. Which method would come closer to the target of 14,300 miles per driver? Method 1 is impossible to test, though our limited experience with gasoline rationing indicates that it probably wouldn't work very well. Method 2, on the other hand, was actually instituted — that is, the following year, drivers drove as much or as little as they pleased without attempting to hit any quota. How did they do? According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that year American drivers drove 2.88 trillion miles, or 14,400 miles per person, only 100 miles above target. What's more, those 200 million drivers also suffered, within less than 200, the same number of fatalities in both years (42,815 versus 42,643).

We associate randomness with disorder. Yet although the lives of 200 million drivers vary unforeseeably, in the aggregate their behavior could hardly have proved more orderly. Analogous regularities can be found if we examine how people vote, buy stocks, marry, are told to get lost, misaddress letters, or sit in traffic on their way to a meeting they didn't want to go to in the first place — or if we measure the length of their legs, the size of their feet, the width of their buttocks, or the breadth of their beer bellies. As nineteenth-century scientists dug into newly available social data, wherever they looked, the chaos of life seemed to produce quantifiable and predictable patterns. But it was not just the regularities that astonished them. It was also the nature of the variation. Social data, they discovered, often follow the normal distribution.

That the variation in human characteristics and behavior is distributed like the error in an archer's aim led some nineteenth-century scientists to study the targets toward which the arrows of human existence are aimed. More important, they sought to understand the social and physical causes that sometimes move the target. And so the field of mathematical statistics, developed to aid scientists in data analysis, flourished in a far different realm: the study of the nature of society.

STATISTICIANS have been analyzing life's data at least since the eleventh century, when William the Conqueror commissioned what was, in effect, the first national census. William began his rule in 1035, at age seven, when he succeeded his father as duke of Normandy. As his moniker implies, Duke William II liked to conquer, and in 1066 he invaded England. By Christmas Day he was able to give himself the present of being crowned king. His swift victory left him with a little problem: whom exactly had he conquered, and more important, how much could he tax his new subjects? To answer those questions, he sent inspectors into every part of England to note the size, ownership, and resources of each parcel of land.6 To make sure they got it right, he sent a second set of inspectors to duplicate the effort of the first set. Since taxation was based not on population but on land and its usage, the inspectors made a valiant effort to count every ox, cow, and pig but didn't gather much data about the people who shoveled their droppings. Even if population data had been relevant, in medieval times a statistical survey regarding the most vital statistics about humans — their life spans and diseases — would have been considered inconsistent with the traditional Christian concept of death. According to that doctrine, it was wrong to make death the object of speculation and almost sacrilegious to look for laws governing it. For whether a person died from a lung infection, a stomachache, or a rock whose impact exceeded the compressive strength of his skull, the true cause of his or her death was considered to be simply God's will. Over the centuries that fatalistic attitude gradually gave way, yielding to an opposing view, according to which, by studying the regularities of nature and society, we are not challenging God's authority but rather learning about his ways.

A big step in that transformation of views came in the sixteenth century, when the lord mayor of London ordered the compilation of weekly「bills of mortality」to account for the christenings and burials recorded by parish clerks. For decades the bills were compiled sporadically, but in 1603, one of the worst years of the plague, the city instituted a weekly tally. Theorists on the Continent turned up their noses at the data-laden mortality bills as peculiarly English and of little use. But to one peculiar Englishman, a shopkeeper named John Graunt, the tallies told a gripping tale.7

Graunt and his friend William Petty have been called the founders of statistics, a field sometimes considered lowbrow by those in pure mathematics owing to its focus on mundane practical issues, and in that sense Graunt in particular makes a fitting founder. For unlike some of the amateurs who developed probability — Cardano the doctor, Fermat the jurist, or Bayes the clergyman — Graunt was a seller of common notions: buttons, thread, needles, and other small items used in a household. But Graunt wasn't just a button salesman; he was a wealthy button salesman, and his wealth afforded him the leisure to pursue interests having nothing to do with implements for holding garments together. It also enabled him to befriend some of the greatest intellectuals of his day, including Petty.

One inference Graunt gleaned from the mortality bills concerned the number of people who starved to death. In 1665 that number was reported to be 45, only about double the number who died from execution. In contrast, 4,808 were reported to have died from consumption, 1,929 from「spotted fever and purples,」2,614 from「teeth and worms,」and 68,596 from the plague. Why, when London was「teeming with beggars,」did so few starve? Graunt concluded that the populace must be feeding the hungry. And so he proposed instead that the state provide the food, thereby costing society nothing while ridding seventeenth-century London streets of their equivalent of panhandlers and squeegee men. Graunt also weighed in on the two leading theories of how the plague is spread. One theory held that the illness was transmitted by foul air; the other, that it was transmitted from person to person. Graunt looked at the week-to-week records of deaths and concluded that the fluctuations in the data were too great to be random, as he expected they would be if the person-to-person theory were correct. On the other hand, since weather varies erratically week by week, he considered the fluctuating data to be consistent with the foul-air theory. As it turned out, London was not ready for soup kitchens, and Londoners would have fared better if they had avoided ugly rats rather than foul air, but Graunt's great discoveries lay not in his conclusions. They lay instead in his realization that statistics can provide insights into the system from which the statistics are derived.

Petty's work is sometimes considered a harbinger of classical economics.8 Believing that the strength of the state depends on, and is reflected by, the number and character of its subjects, Petty employed statistical reasoning to analyze national issues. Typically his analyses were made from the point of view of the sovereign and treated members of society as objects to be manipulated at will. Regarding the plague, he pointed out that money should be spent on prevention because, in saving lives, the realm would preserve part of the considerable investment society made in raising men and women to maturity and therefore would reap a higher return than it would on the most lucrative of alternative investments. Regarding the Irish, Petty was not as charitable. He concluded, for example, that the economic value of an English life was greater than that of an Irish one, so the wealth of the kingdom would be increased if all Irishmen except a few cowherds were forcibly relocated to England. As it happened, Petty owed his own wealth to those same Irish: as a doctor with the invading British army in the 1650s, he had been given the task of assessing the spoils and assessed that he could get away with grabbing a good share for himself, which he did.9

If, as Petty believed, the size and growth of a population reflect the quality of its government, then the lack of a good method for measuring the size of a population made the assessment of its government difficult. Graunt's most famous calculations addressed that issue — in particular the population of London. From the bills of mortality, Graunt knew the number of births. Since he had a rough idea of the fertility rate, he could infer how many women were of childbearing age. That datum allowed him to guess the total number of families and, using his own observations of the mean size of a London family, thereby estimate the city's population. He came up with 384,000 — previously it was believed to be 2 million. Graunt also raised eyebrows by showing that much of the growth of the city was due to immigration from outlying areas, not to the slower method of procreation, and that despite the horrors of the plague, the decrease in population due to even the worst epidemic was always made up within two years. In addition, Graunt is generally credited with publishing the first「life table,」a systematic arrangement of life-expectancy data that today is widely employed by organizations — from life insurance companies to the World Health Organization — that are interested in knowing how long people live. A life table displays how many people, in a group of 100, can be expected to survive to any given age. To Graunt's data (the column in the table below labeled「London, 1662」), I've added columns exhibiting the same data for a few countries today.10

Graunt's life table extended

In 1662, Graunt published his analyses in Natural and Political Observations…upon the Bills of Mortality. The book met with acclaim. A year later Graunt was elected to the Royal Society. Then, in 1666, the Great Fire of London, which burned down a large part of the city, destroyed his business. To add insult to injury, he was accused of helping to cause the destruction by giving instructions to halt the water supply just before the fire started. In truth he had no affiliation with the water company until after the fire. Still, after that episode, Graunt's name disappeared from the books of the Royal Society. Graunt died of jaundice a few years later.

Largely because of Graunt's work, in 1667 the French fell in line with the British and revised their legal code to enable surveys like the bills of mortality. Other European countries followed suit. By the nineteenth century, statisticians all over Europe were up to their elbows in government records such as census data — 「an avalanche of numbers.」11 Graunt's legacy was to demonstrate that inferences about a population as a whole could be made by carefully examining a limited sample of data. But though Graunt and others made valiant efforts to learn from the data through the application of simple logic, most of the data's secrets awaited the development of the tools created by Gauss, Laplace, and others in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

THE TERM statistics entered the English language from the German word Statistik through a 1770 translation of the book Bielfield's Elementary Universal Education, which stated that「the science that is called statistics teaches us what is the political arrangement of all the modern states in the known world.」12 By 1828 the subject had evolved such that Noah Webster's American Dictionary defined statistics as「a collection of facts respecting the state of society, the condition of the people in a nation or country, their health, longevity, domestic economy, arts, property and political strength, the state of their country, &c.」13 The field had embraced the methods of Laplace, who had sought to extend his mathematical analysis from planets and stars to issues of everyday life.

The normal distribution describes the manner in which many phenomena vary around a central value that represents their most probable outcome; in his Essai philosophique sur les probabilités, Laplace argued that this new mathematics could be employed to assess legal testimony, predict marriage rates, calculate insurance premiums. But by the final edition of that work, Laplace was in his sixties, and so it fell to a younger man to develop his ideas. That man was Adolphe Quételet, born in Ghent, Flanders, on February 22, 1796.14

Quételet did not enter his studies spurred by a keen interest in the workings of society. His dissertation, which in 1819 earned him the first doctorate in science awarded by the new university in Ghent, was on the theory of conic sections, a topic in geometry. His interest then turned to astronomy, and around 1820 he became active in a movement to found a new observatory in Brussels, where he had taken a position. An ambitious man, Quételet apparently saw the observatory as a step toward establishing a scientific empire. It was an audacious move, not least because he knew relatively little about astronomy and virtually nothing about running an observatory. But he must have been persuasive, because not only did his observatory receive funding, but he personally received a grant to travel to Paris for several months to remedy the deficiencies in his knowledge. It proved a sound investment, for Quételet's Royal Observatory of Belgium is still in existence today.

In Paris, Quételet was affected in his own way by the disorder of life, and it pulled him in a completely different direction. His romance with statistics began when he made the acquaintance of several great French mathematicians, including Laplace and Joseph Fourier, and studied statistics and probability with Fourier. In the end, though he learned how to run an observatory, he fell in love with a different pursuit, the idea of applying the mathematical tools of astronomy to social data.

When Quételet returned to Brussels, he began to collect and analyze demographic data, soon focusing on records of criminal activity that the French government began to publish in 1827. In Sur l'homme et le développement de ses facultés, a two-volume work he published in 1835, Quételet printed a table of annual murders reported in France from 1826 to 1831. The number of murders, he noted, was relatively constant, as was the proportion of murders committed each year with guns, swords, knives, canes, stones, instruments for cutting and stabbing, kicks and punches, strangulation, drowning, and fire.15 Quételet also analyzed mortality according to age, geography, season, and profession, as well as in hospitals and prisons. He studied statistics on drunkenness, insanity, and crime. And he discovered statistical regularities describing suicide by hanging in Paris and the number of marriages between sixty-something women and twenty-something men in Belgium.

Statisticians had conducted such studies before, but Quételet did something more with the data: he went beyond examining the average to scrutinizing the manner in which the data strayed from its average. Wherever he looked, Quételet found the normal distribution: in the propensities to crime, marriage, and suicide and in the height of American Indians and the chest measurements of Scottish soldiers (he came upon a sample of 5,738 chest measurements in an old issue of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal). In the height of 100,000 young Frenchmen called up for the draft he also found meaning in a deviation from the normal distribution. In that data, when the number of conscripts was plotted against their height, the bell-shaped curve was distorted: too few prospects were just above five feet two and a compensating surplus was just below that height. Quételet argued that the difference — about 2,200 extra「short men」 — was due to fraud or, you might say friendly fudging, as those below five feet two were excused from service.

Decades later the great French mathematician Jules-Henri Poincaré employed Quételet's method to nab a baker who was shortchanging his customers. At first, Poincaré, who made a habit of picking up a loaf of bread each day, noticed after weighing his loaves that they averaged about 950 grams instead of the 1,000 grams advertised. He complained to the authorities and afterward received bigger loaves. Still he had a hunch that something about his bread wasn't kosher. And so with the patience only a famous — or at least tenured — scholar can afford, he carefully weighed his bread every day for the next year. Though his bread now averaged closer to 1,000 grams, if the baker had been honestly handing him random loaves, the number of loaves heavier and lighter than the mean should have — as I mentioned in chapter 7 — diminished following the bell-shaped pattern of the error law. Instead, Poincaré found that there were too few light loaves and a surplus of heavy ones. He concluded that the baker had not ceased baking underweight loaves but instead was seeking to placate him by always giving him the largest loaf he had on hand. The police again visited the cheating baker, who was reportedly appropriately astonished and presumably agreed to change his ways.16

Quételet had stumbled on a useful discovery: the patterns of randomness are so reliable that in certain social data their violation can be taken as evidence of wrongdoing. Today such analyses are applied to reams of data too large to have been analyzed in Quételet's time. In recent years, in fact, such statistical sleuthing has become popular, creating a new field, called forensic economics, perhaps the most famous example of which is the statistical study suggesting that companies were backdating their stock option grants. The idea is simple: companies grant stock options — the right to buy shares later at the price of the stock on the date of the grant — as an incentive for executives to improve their firms' share prices. If the grants are backdated to times when the shares were especially low, the executives' profits will be correspondingly high. A clever idea, but when done in secret it violates securities laws. It also leaves a statistical fingerprint, which has led to the investigation of such practices at about a dozen major companies.17 In a less publicized example, Justin Wolfers, an economist at the Wharton School, found evidence of fraud in the results of about 70,000 college basketball games.18

Wolfers discovered the anomaly by comparing Las Vegas bookmakers' point spreads to the games' actual outcomes. When one team is favored, the bookmakers offer point spreads in order to attract a roughly even number of bets on both competitors. For instance, suppose the basketball team at Caltech is considered better than the team at UCLA (for college basketball fans, yes, this was actually true in the 1950s). Rather than assigning lopsided odds, bookies could instead offer an even bet on the game but pay out on a Caltech bet only if their team beat UCLA by, say, 13 or more points.

Though such point spreads are set by the bookies, they are really fixed by the mass of bettors because the bookies adjust them to balance the demand. (Bookies make their money on fees and seek to have an equal amount of money bet on each side so that they can't lose, whatever the outcome.) To measure how well bettors assess two teams, economists use a number called the forecast error, which is the difference between the favored team's margin of victory and the point spread determined by the marketplace. It may come as no surprise that forecast error, being a type of error, is distributed according to the normal distribution. Wolfers found that its mean is 0, meaning that the point spreads don't tend to either overrate or underrate teams, and its standard deviation is 10.9 points, meaning that about two thirds of the time the point spread is within 10.9 points of the margin of victory. (In a study of professional football games, a similar result was found, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 13.9 points.)19

When Wolfers examined the subset of games that involved heavy favorites, he found something astonishing: there were too few games in which the heavy favorite won by a little more than the point spread and an inexplicable surplus of games in which the favorite won by just less. This was again Quételet's anomaly. Wolfers's conclusion, like Quételet's and Poincaré's, was fraud. His analysis went like this: it is hard for even a top player to ensure that his team will beat a point spread, but if the team is a heavy favorite, a player, without endangering his team's chance of victory, can slack off enough to ensure that the team does not beat the spread. And so if unscrupulous bettors wanted to fix games without asking players to risk losing, the result would be just the distortions Wolfers found. Does Wolfers's work prove that in some percentage of college basketball games, players are taking bribes to shave points? No, but as Wolfers says,「You shouldn't have what's happening on the court reflecting what's happening in Las Vegas.」And it is interesting to note that in a recent poll by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, 1.5 percent of players admitted knowing a teammate「who took money for playing poorly.」20

QUÉTELET DID NOT PURSUE the forensic applications of his ideas. He had bigger plans: to employ the normal distribution in order to illuminate the nature of people and society. If you made 1,000 copies of a statue, he wrote, those copies would vary due to errors of measurement and workmanship, and that variation would be governed by the error law. If the variation in people's physical traits follows the same law, he reasoned, it must be because we, too, are imperfect replicas of a prototype. Quételet called that prototype l'homme moyen, the average man. He felt that a template existed for human behavior too. The manager of a large department store may not know whether the spacey new cashier will pocket that half-ounce bottle of Chanel Allure she was sniffing, but he can count on the prediction that in the retail business, inventory loss runs pretty steadily from year to year at about 1.6 percent and that consistently about 45 percent to 48 percent of it is due to employee theft.21 Crime, Quételet wrote, is「like a budget that is paid with frightening regularity.」22

Quételet recognized that l'homme moyen would be different for different cultures and that it could change with changing social conditions. In fact, it is the study of those changes and their causes that was Quételet's greatest ambition.「Man is born, grows up, and dies according to certain laws,」he wrote, and those laws「have never been studied.」23 Newton became the father of modern physics by recognizing and formulating a set of universal laws. Modeling himself after Newton, Quételet desired to create a new「social physics」describing the laws of human behavior. In Quételet's analogy, just as an object, if undisturbed, continues in its state of motion, so the mass behavior of people, if social conditions remain unchanged, remains constant. And just as Newton described how physical forces deflect an object from its straight path, so Quételet sought laws of human behavior describing how social forces transform the characteristics of society. For example, Quételet thought that vast inequalities of wealth and great fluctuations in prices were responsible for crime and social unrest and that a steady level of crime represented a state of equilibrium, which would change with changes in the underlying causes. A vivid example of such a change in social equilibrium occurred in the months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when travelers, afraid to take airplanes, suddenly switched to cars. Their fear translated into about 1,000 more highway fatalities in that period than in the same period the year before — hidden casualties of the September 11 attack.24

But to believe that a social physics exists is one thing, and to define one is another. In a true science, Quételet realized, theories could be explored by placing people in a great number of experimental situations and measuring their behavior. Since that is not possible, he concluded that social science is more like astronomy than physics, with insights deduced from passive observation. And so, seeking to uncover the laws of social physics, he studied the temporal and cultural variation in l'homme moyen.

Quételet's ideas were well received, especially in France and Great Britain. One physiologist even collected urine from a railroad-station urinal frequented by people of many nationalities in order to determine the properties of the「average European urine.」25 In Britain, Quételet's most enthusiastic disciple was a wealthy chess player and historian named Henry Thomas Buckle, best known for an ambitious multivolume book called History of Civilization in England. Unfortunately, in 1861, when he was forty, Buckle caught typhus while traveling in Damascus. Offered the services of a local physician, he refused because the man was French, and so he died. Buckle hadn't finished his treatise. But he did complete the initial two volumes, the first of which presented history from a statistical point of view. It was based on the work of Quételet and was an instant success. Read throughout Europe, it was translated into French, German, and Russian. Darwin read it; Alfred Russel Wallace read it; Dostoyevsky read it twice.26

Despite the book's popularity, the verdict of history is that Quételet's mathematics proved more sensible than his social physics. For one thing, not all that happens in society, especially in the financial realm, is governed by the normal distribution. For example, if film revenue were normally distributed, most films would earn near some average amount, and two-thirds of all film revenue would fall within a standard deviation of that number. But in the film business, 20 percent of the movies bring in 80 percent of the revenue. Such hit-driven businesses, though thoroughly unpredictable, follow a far different distribution, one for which the concepts of mean and standard deviation have no meaning because there is no「typical」performance, and megahit outliers, which in an ordinary business might occur only once every few centuries, happen every few years.27

More important than his ignoring other probability distributions, though, is Quételet's failure to make much progress in uncovering the laws and forces he sought. So in the end his direct impact on the social sciences proved modest, yet his legacy is both undeniable and far-reaching. It lies not in the social sciences but in the「hard」sciences, where his approach to understanding the order in large numbers of random events inspired many scholars and spawned revolutionary work that transformed the manner of thinking in both biology and physics.

IT WAS CHARLES DARWIN'S FIRST COUSIN who introduced statistical thinking to biology. A man of leisure, Francis Galton had entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1840.28 He first studied medicine but then followed Darwin's advice and changed his field to mathematics. He was twenty-two when his father died and he inherited a substantial sum. Never needing to work for a living, he became an amateur scientist. His obsession was measurement. He measured the size of people's heads, noses, and limbs, the number of times people fidgeted while listening to lectures, and the degree of attractiveness of girls he passed on the street (London girls scored highest; Aberdeen, lowest). He measured the characteristics of people's fingerprints, an endeavor that led to the adoption of fingerprint identification by Scotland Yard in 1901. He even measured the life spans of sovereigns and clergymen, which, being similar to the life spans of people in other professions, led him to conclude that prayer brought no benefit.

In his 1869 book, Hereditary Genius, Galton wrote that the fraction of the population in any given range of heights must be nearly uniform over time and that the normal distribution governs height and every other physical feature: circumference of the head, size of the brain, weight of the gray matter, number of brain fibers, and so on. But Galton didn't stop there. He believed that human character, too, is determined by heredity and, like people's physical features, obeys in some manner the normal distribution. And so, according to Galton, men are not「of equal value, as social units, equally capable of voting, and the rest.」29 Instead, he asserted, about 250 out of every 1 million men inherit exceptional ability in some area and as a result become eminent in their field. (As, in his day, women did not generally work, he did not make a similar analysis of them.) Galton founded a new field of study based on those ideas, calling it eugenics, from the Greek words eu (good) and genos (birth). Over the years, eugenics has meant many different things to many different people. The term and some of his ideas were adopted by the Nazis, but there is no evidence that Galton would have approved of the Germans' murderous schemes. His hope, rather, was to find a way to improve the condition of humankind through selective breeding.

Much of chapter 9 is devoted to understanding the reasons Galton's simple cause-and-effect interpretation of success is so seductive. But we'll see in chapter 10 that because of the myriad of foreseeable and chance obstacles that must be overcome to complete a task of any complexity, the connection between ability and accomplishment is far less direct than anything that can possibly be explained by Galton's ideas. In fact, in recent years psychologists have found that the ability to persist in the face of obstacles is at least as important a factor in success as talent.30 That's why experts often speak of the「ten-year rule,」meaning that it takes at least a decade of hard work, practice, and striving to become highly successful in most endeavors. It might seem daunting to think that effort and chance, as much as innate talent, are what counts. But I find it encouraging because, while our genetic makeup is out of our control, our degree of effort is up to us. And the effects of chance, too, can be controlled to the extent that by committing ourselves to repeated attempts, we can increase our odds of success.

Whatever the pros and cons of eugenics, Galton's studies of inheritance led him to discover two mathematical concepts that are central to modern statistics. One came to him in 1875, after he distributed packets of sweet pea pods to seven friends. Each friend received seeds of uniform size and weight and returned to Galton the seeds of the successive generations. On measuring them, Galton noticed that the median diameter of the offspring of large seeds was less than that of the parents, whereas the median diameter of the offspring of small seeds was greater than that of the parents. Later, employing data he obtained from a laboratory he had set up in London, he noticed the same effect in the height of human parents and children. He dubbed the phenomenon — that in linked measurements, if one measured quantity is far from its mean, the other will be closer to its mean — regression toward the mean.

Galton soon realized that processes that did not exhibit regression toward the mean would eventually go out of control. For example, suppose the sons of tall fathers would on average be as tall as their fathers. Since heights vary, some sons would be taller. Now imagine the next generation, and suppose the sons of the taller sons, grandsons of the original men, were also on average as tall as their fathers. Some of them, too, would have to be taller than their fathers. In this way, as generation followed generation, the tallest humans would be ever taller. Because of regression toward the mean, that does not happen. The same can be said of innate intelligence, artistic talent, or the ability to hit a golf ball. And so very tall parents should not expect their children to be as tall, very brilliant parents should not expect their children to be as brilliant, and the Picassos and Tiger Woodses of this world should not expect their children to match their accomplishments. On the other hand, very short parents can expect taller offspring, and those of us who are not brilliant or can't paint have reasonable hope that our deficiencies will be improved upon in the next generation.

At his laboratory, Galton attracted subjects through advertisements and then subjected them to a series of measurements of height, weight, even the dimensions of certain bones. His goal was to find a method for predicting the measurements of children based on those of their parents. One of Galton's plots showed parents' heights versus the heights of their offspring. If, say, those heights were always equal, the graph would be a neat line rising at 45 degrees. If that relationship held on average but individual data points varied, then the data would show some scatter above and below that line. Galton's graphs thus exhibited visually not just the general relationship between the heights of parent and offspring but also the degree to which the relationship holds. That was Galton's other major contribution to statistics: defining a mathematical index describing the consistency of such relationships. He called it the coefficient of correlation.

The coefficient of correlation is a number between -1 and 1; if it is near ± 1, it indicates that two variables are linearly related; a coefficient of 0 means there is no relation. For example, if data revealed that by eating the latest McDonald's 1,000-calorie meal once a week, people gained 10 pounds a year and by eating it twice a week they gained 20 pounds, and so on, the correlation coefficient would be 1. If for some reason everyone were to instead lose those amounts of weight, the correlation coefficient would be -1. And if the weight gain and loss were all over the map and didn't depend on meal consumption, the coefficient would be 0. Today correlation coefficients are among the most widely employed concepts in statistics. They are used to assess such relationships as those between the number of cigarettes smoked and the incidence of cancer, the distance of stars from Earth and the speed with which they are moving away from our planet, and the scores students achieve on standardized tests and the income of the students' families.

Galton's work was significant not just for its direct importance but because it inspired much of the statistical work done in the decades that followed, in which the field of statistics grew rapidly and matured. One of the most important of these advances was made by Karl Pearson, a disciple of Galton's. Earlier in this chapter, I mentioned many types of data that are distributed according to the normal distribution. But with a finite set of data the fit is never perfect. In the early days of statistics, scientists sometimes determined whether data were normally distributed simply by graphing them and observing the shape of the resulting curve. But how do you quantify the accuracy of the fit? Pearson invented a method, called the chi-square test, by which you can determine whether a set of data actually conforms to the distribution you believe it conforms to. He demonstrated his test in Monte Carlo in July 1892, performing a kind of rigorous repeat of Jagger's work.31 In Pearson's test, as in Jagger's, the numbers that came up on a roulette wheel did not follow the distribution they would have followed if the wheel had produced random results. In another test, Pearson examined how many 5s and 6s came up in 26,306 tosses of twelve dice. He found that the distribution was not one you'd see in a chance experiment with fair dice — that is, in an experiment in which the probability of a 5 or a 6 on one roll were 1 in 3, or 0.3333. But it was consistent if the probability of a 5 or a 6 were 0.3377 — that is, if the dice were skewed. In the case of the roulette wheel the game may have been rigged, but the dice were probably biased owing to variations in manufacturing, which my friend Moshe emphasized are always present.

Today chi-square tests are widely employed. Suppose, for instance, that instead of testing dice, you wish to test three cereal boxes for their consumer appeal. If consumers have no preference, you would expect about 1 in 3 of those polled to vote for each box. As we've seen, the actual results will rarely be distributed so evenly. Employing the chi-square test, you can determine how likely it is that the winning box received more votes due to consumer preference rather than to chance. Similarly, suppose researchers at a pharmaceutical company perform an experiment in which they test two treatments used in preventing acute transplant rejection. They can use a chi-square test to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the results. Or suppose that before opening a new outlet, the CFO of a rental car company expects that 25 percent of the company's customers will request subcompact cars, 50 percent will want compacts, and 12.5 percent each will ask for cars in the midsize and「other」categories. When the data begin to come in, a chi-square test can help the CFO quickly decide whether his assumption was correct or the new site is atypical and the company would do well to alter the mix.

Through Galton, Quételet's work infused the biological sciences. But Quételet also helped spur a revolution in the physical sciences: both James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, two of the founders of statistical physics, drew inspiration from Quételet's theories. (Like Darwin and Dostoyevsky, they read of them in Buckle's book.) After all, if the chests of 5,738 Scottish soldiers distribute themselves nicely along the curve of the normal distribution and the average yearly mileage of 200 million drivers can vary by as little as 100 miles from year to year, it doesn't take an Einstein to guess that the 10 septillion or so molecules in a liter of gas might exhibit some interesting regularities. But actually it did take an Einstein to finally convince the scientific world of the need for that new approach to physics. Albert Einstein did it in 1905, the same year in which he published his first work on relativity. And though hardly known in popular culture, Einstein's 1905 paper on statistical physics proved equally revolutionary. In the scientific literature, in fact, it would become his most cited work.32

EINSTEIN'S 1905 WORK on statistical physics was aimed at explaining a phenomenon called Brownian motion. The process was named for Robert Brown, botanist, world expert in microscopy, and the person credited with writing the first clear description of the cell nucleus. Brown's goal in life, pursued with relentless energy, was to discover through his observations the source of the life force, a mysterious influence believed in his day to endow something with the property of being alive. In that quest, Brown was doomed to failure, but one day in June 1827, he thought he had succeeded.

Peering through his lens, Brown noted that the granules inside the pollen grains he was observing seemed to be moving.33 Though a source of life, pollen is not itself a living being. Yet as long as Brown stared, the movement never ceased, as if the granules possessed some mysterious energy. This was not intentioned movement; it seemed, in fact, to be completely random. With great excitement, Brown concluded at first that he had bagged his quarry, for what could this energy be but the energy that powers life itself?

In a string of experiments he performed assiduously over the next month, Brown observed the same kind of movement when suspending in water, and sometimes in gin, as wide a variety of organic particles as he could get his hands on: decomposing fibers of veal, spider's web「blackened with London dust,」even his own mucus. Then, in a deathblow to his wishful interpretation of the discovery, Brown also observed the motion when looking at inorganic particles — of asbestos, copper, bismuth, antimony, and manganese. He knew then that the movement he was observing was unrelated to the issue of life. The true cause of Brownian motion would prove to be the same force that compelled the regularities in human behavior that Quételet had noted — not a physical force but an apparent force arising from the patterns of randomness. Unfortunately, Brown did not live to see this explanation of the phenomenon he observed.

The groundwork for the understanding of Brownian motion was laid in the decades that followed Brown's work, by Boltzmann, Maxwell, and others. Inspired by Quételet, they created the new field of statistical physics, employing the mathematical edifice of probability and statistics to explain how the properties of fluids arise from the movement of the (then hypothetical) atoms that make them up. Their ideas did not catch on for several more decades, however. Some scientists had mathematical issues with the theory. Others objected because at the time no one had ever seen an atom and no one believed anyone ever would. But most physicists are practical, and so the most important roadblock to acceptance was that although the theory reproduced some laws that were known, it made few new predictions. And so matters stood until 1905, when long after Maxwell was dead and shortly before a despondent Boltzmann would commit suicide, Einstein employed the nascent theory to explain in great numerical detail the precise mechanism of Brownian motion.34 The necessity of a statistical approach to physics would never again be in doubt, and the idea that matter is made of atoms and molecules would prove to be the basis of most modern technology and one of the most important ideas in the history of physics.

The random motion of molecules in a fluid can be viewed, as we'll note in chapter 10, as a metaphor for our own paths through life, and so it is worthwhile to take a little time to give Einstein's work a closer look. According to the atomic picture, the fundamental motion of water molecules is chaotic. The molecules fly first this way, then that, moving in a straight line only until deflected by an encounter with one of their sisters. As mentioned in the Prologue, this type of path — in which at various points the direction changes randomly — is often called a drunkard's walk, for reasons obvious to anyone who has ever enjoyed a few too many martinis (more sober mathematicians and scientists sometimes call it a random walk). If particles that float in a liquid are, as atomic theory predicts, constantly and randomly bombarded by the molecules of the liquid, one might expect them to jiggle this way and that owing to the collisions. But there are two problems with that picture of Brownian motion: first, the molecules are far too light to budge the visible floating particles; second, molecular collisions occur far more frequently than the observed jiggles. Part of Einstein's genius was to realize that those two problems cancel each other out: though the collisions occur very frequently, because the molecules are so light, those frequent isolated collisions have no visible effect. It is only when pure luck occasionally leads to a lopsided preponderance of hits from some particular direction — the molecular analogue of Roger Maris's record year in baseball — that a noticeable jiggle occurs. When Einstein did the math, he found that despite the chaos on the microscopic level, there was a predictable relationship between factors such as the size, number, and speed of the molecules and the observable frequency and magnitude of the jiggling. Einstein had, for the first time, connected new and measurable consequences to statistical physics. That might sound like a largely technical achievement, but on the contrary, it represented the triumph of a great principle: that much of the order we perceive in nature belies an invisible underlying disorder and hence can be understood only through the rules of randomness. As Einstein wrote,「It is a magnificent feeling to recognize the unity of a complex of phenomena which appear to be things quite apart from the direct visible truth.」35

In Einstein's mathematical analysis the normal distribution again played a central role, reaching a new place of glory in the history of science. The drunkard's walk, too, became established as one of the most fundamental — and soon one of the most studied — processes in nature. For as scientists in all fields began to accept the statistical approach as legitimate, they recognized the thumbprints of the drunkard's walk in virtually all areas of study — in the foraging of mosquitoes through cleared African jungle, in the chemistry of nylon, in the formation of plastics, in the motion of free quantum particles, in the movement of stock prices, even in the evolution of intelligence over eons of time. We'll examine the effects of randomness on our own paths through life in chapter 10. But as we're about to see, though in random variation there are orderly patterns, patterns are not always meaningful. And as important as it is to recognize the meaning when it is there, it is equally important not to extract meaning when it is not there. Avoiding the illusion of meaning in random patterns is a difficult task. It is the subject of the following chapter.

0801混沌中的秩序

20 世纪 60 年代中期，一名 90 多岁高龄的法国妇女让娜·卡尔梅，因急需生活费而跟一个 47 岁的律师做了笔交易：她将自己的公寓低价卖给律师，律师则按月给她提供生活费，直到她过世。等到了那一天，她横着出去，律师竖着进来。律师肯定知道卡尔梅女士的寿命已超出法国人期望寿命达 10 年之多。不过看来他大概并不了解贝叶斯定理，所以也不知道他所了解的这位女士在超过预期寿命的 10 年中去世的概率其实跟这笔买卖没啥关系，而真正跟买卖有关的，是在这位女士已经活到 90 岁的前提下，她的期望寿命大概还有 6 年。不过即便如此，律师也觉得这笔买卖不必担心会亏本。因为他相信，不管是哪个女人，如果她十来岁时就已经在父亲的店中遇见过文森特·凡高，那么他完全有理由相信，她跟凡高的再次会面一定用不了多长时间。（据说该女士认为我们的大艺术家「邋里邋遢，穿衣没品，惹人讨厌」。）

果不其然，在 10 年后，律师不得不另找一处住所栖身，而让娜则用自己良好的健康状况庆祝了她的第 100 个生日。尽管这时她的期望寿命只有差不多 2 年，但靠着律师的奉养，她又度过了 110 岁的生日，而律师已经 67 岁了。再过 10 年，律师漫长的等待终于到了头，却是他没有猜中的结局。1995 年，律师去世了，让娜还活着。她自己的那一日最终于 1997 年 8 月 4 日到来了，这时她已是 122 岁高龄，比律师的寿命多了整整 45 个年头。

单个个体的期望寿命以及命运是无法被预计的。但如果从大群体采集数据，并在大规模数据上进行总体分析，具有规律性的模型就会浮现出来。假设你已经 20 年没有出过交通事故了。然后在那个命中注定的下午，你跟妻子和她的娘家人一道在魁北克度假，你的岳母突然大叫一声：「当心驼鹿！」你一打方向盘，直接撞向了写着同样内容的警示牌。对你来说，这一定是一起你不打算重现的特殊事件。但是，警示牌存在本身，反映的就是一种客观需要。在那些数以千计的驾驶员中，肯定有一定比例的人会碰上驼鹿。实际上，随机行动的个人所构成的统计集合，常常表现出自洽且可以预测的行为，就好像这是一群有意识地追求某个共同目标的人。或者如哲学家康德在 1784 年所写：「每个个人，按照自己的喜好，追逐着自己的目标，并常与他人的目标相左；但每个个人或民族，都通向一个自然的但对他们而言都属未知的目标，就好像追随着某条引领之线；所有人都为这个目标做着努力，哪怕当他们知道目标的存在却对它不加重视时，也一样在努力。」

根据美国联邦公路总署的资料，美国大约有 2 亿名司机。美国国家公路交通安全管理局的数据显示，在最近的某一年中，这些司机共行驶了约 2.86 万亿英里的里程 ，差不多是每人 1.43 万英里。现在，假设美国人民想搞个好玩的事情，就是让司机们在下一年中跑出同样的总里程数。那我们来比较两种方法，它们都可以达到这个目的。方法一是由政府在国家自然科学基金会的一个超级计算中心，建立一个定量配给系统，将每人的目标行驶里程分配下去，以便在满足这 2 亿名司机各自需要的同时，还保持前一年那 1.43 万英里的平均里程。而在方法二中，我们告诉司机，不要有任何压力，你爱开多远就开多远，不用去管前一年到底跑了多少里程。如果从来都是步行去酒铺上班的比利·鲍勃叔叔，这次决定要当个霰弹枪推销员，到西得克萨斯跑上 10 万英里，没问题；住在曼哈顿的简表妹总是把大部分里程花在在道路清洁日围着她住的街区团团乱转找车位上，但现在她结了婚并搬到了新泽西，那么我们也不用担心她的里程数是否因此而改变。那么在这两种方法中，哪个能更准确地达到 1.43 万英里这个人均年里程数目标呢？我们没法对方法一进行实验，不过，根据以往在一段有限的时间内实施汽油配给政策的经验来看，这个方法大概不会很奏效；另一方面，方法二其实就是我们在实际中采用的方法：在下一年中，司机们高兴开多远就开多远，根本没想过要去达到什么配额之类的问题。那他们的表现如何呢？根据美国国家公路交通安全管理局的数据，在接下来的一年中，美国司机开了 2.88 万亿英里，或者每人 1.44 万英里，不过比目标多了 100 英里而已。而且，这 2 亿名司机出现了几乎同样多的交通死亡人数（42815 人对 42643 人），与上一年相比相差不到 200 人。

我们总是将随机性与无序联系在一起。尽管 2 亿名司机的生活总是在发生着无法预知的变化，我们却很难证明，他们作为一个整体的行为，能够比上面描述的行为更为有序。我们如果去看看诸如投票、买股票、结婚、人口失踪、信件写错地址，或者在去一个原本不打算参加的会议途中碰到堵车之类的情况，或者我们在测量人们腿的长度、脚的尺码、臀部的宽度或啤酒肚的厚度时，我们就能发现类似的规律性。当 19 世纪的科学家一头扎进前不久才开始能够获取的社会学数据时，他们发现不管在什么类型的数据中，生活中的混沌似乎总是会形成可以被量化描述也可以被预测的模式。但这些规律性并非唯一令人震惊的地方，同样令人惊讶的还有这些数据变化的性质，因为科学家发现，社会学中的数据也常常遵循正态分布。

人类的特征与行为的差异，以及弓箭手瞄准的误差，这两者竟然具有相似的分布情况，这个事实促使 19 世纪的一些科学家开始思索，如果将我们人类本身的存在比喻为一支箭，那么这支箭瞄准的目标到底是什么？而比找到这个目标更加重要的，是了解到底有哪些社会和自然方面的因素，使得这个目标有时会发生改变。因此，数学统计学这个为帮助科学家分析数据而发展起来的学科，在一个大相径庭的领域中蓬勃发展起来，这个领域就是对社会运行规律的本质的研究。

统计学家对日常生活中的数据进行分析的做法，出现时间至迟不会晚于 11 世纪。当时，威廉一世派人进行了事实上的史上首次全英格兰普查。威廉的统治始于 1035 年，时年 7 岁的他继承了父亲诺曼底公爵之位。正如其绰号「征服者威廉」所示，威廉一世喜欢征服，并在 1066 年入侵了英格兰。圣诞节那天他送给自己的礼物，就是英格兰的王冠。这种迅速的胜利给他留下了一点儿小问题：这些被他征服的到底是什么人？而更重要的问题是，他能从这些新臣民身上收多少税？为了获得这些问题的答案，他派人调查英格兰的每个角落，记录每一块土地的大小，土地的所有者，以及土地上有哪些资源。为了确保结果的正确性，在第一批巡察员的工作结束后，他又派出第二批巡察员。当时的税并不是按人头来收取的，收税的依据是土地的面积及用途。因此，巡察员付出了称得上勇气可嘉的努力，清点了公牛、奶牛和猪的数量，不过关于为它们清理排泄物的人，却没有什么记录被留下来。不过就算当时的税收和人口数据有关，就算想在中世纪对与人有关的最重要的寿命和疾病数据进行调查，也会被认为与基督教传统的死亡观念相悖。根据基督教教义，将死亡作为理性思考的对象本身就是错误的，而试图寻找掌管死亡规律的行为，简直就是亵渎神灵。不管人们是死于肺部感染、胃痛，还是石头的冲击力超过了头骨的承受力，他或她的真正死因，都被简单地认为是上帝的意旨。需要经过许多个世纪，这种宿命的态度才会慢慢退出历史舞台，而接替它的是相反的观点。根据新观点，研究自然和社会的规律性并非挑战上帝的权威，而是试图理解上帝的行事方式。

这个观念转变过程在 16 世纪迈出了一大步。当时的伦敦市长下令编撰每周一期的「死亡表」，以归总教区教士所记录的洗礼和葬礼。编撰工作在数十年中偶尔进行着，但在 1603 年这个瘟疫最为猖獗的年份之一，伦敦创立了周记制度。欧洲大陆的神学家们对这些满页都是数据的死亡表不屑一顾，这被视为典型的英国做派，几乎毫无用处。但是，对店主约翰·格朗特这个英国人来说，表中的数据却叙述了一个引人入胜的故事。

格朗特和朋友威廉·配第被称为统计学的奠基人。纯数学领域的研究者有时会觉得这个领域十分浅薄，因为它关注的是凡夫俗子的实用问题。从这个意义来说，让格朗特作为这个领域的创建者，其身份跟这个领域给人留下的印象尤其相配。与建立概率论的业余爱好者如医生卡尔达诺、法官费马或神父贝叶斯这些人不同，格朗特是个买卖纽扣、针线之类家居小饰品的商人。但格朗特不仅仅是纽扣商，他还是个有钱的纽扣商。财富使他有足够的闲暇，这让他可以去追求一些跟如何扣衣服毫无关系的兴趣与爱好。财富还使他和一些当代最伟大的知识分子成为朋友，其中就包括配第。

格朗特从死亡表中得出的推论之一，是关于饿死的人数。1665 年，这个数字据称是 45 人，大概只是被处决人数的一倍；相比之下，有 4808 人死于肺病，1929 人死于斑点热和紫癜，2614 人死于牙病和寄生虫病，68596 人死于瘟疫。那是什么原因使得伦敦在「乞丐成堆」的时候，却只有这么几个人是饿死的？格朗特认为，这肯定是因为普通民众乐于施舍食物，才使得乞丐们免于饿死。他因此提出，国家应该给缺衣少食的穷人提供食物，这样一来，一方面社会大众不必付出太多，另一方面 17 世纪伦敦的街道也不至于被与之相称的乞丐和擦车仔们给堵个满满当当。格朗特还参加了瘟疫传播方式的两种理论的争论。一种理论认为这种疾病是通过污浊的空气传播的，而另一种则认为传播是通过人与人的接触完成的。格朗特观察了一周又一周的死亡记录，最后认为，因瘟疫致死人数的数据，其变动幅度太大，令人无法相信这种变动是完全随机的。根据他的观点，人与人之间接触的模式基本上是恒定的，因此人传人的理论如果是正确的，那么死亡人数的波动应该表现出随机性。而另一方面，每周的天气变化都可能相当大，超出一般的随机波动范围，所以他觉得，这些波动的数据与污浊空气理论更为一致。当然，后来的事情表明，伦敦并没有为开设粥场做好准备，而伦敦市民如果远离丑陋的老鼠而不是污浊的空气，那么他们也会活得更好些。但是格朗特的伟大发现并不在于得出某个具体问题的结论，而在于他认识到，我们可以通过统计数据，更好地洞察产生这些数据的那个体系。

配第被一些人认为是古典经济学的先驱。配第相信，国家的力量有赖于臣民的数量和性格，并最终通过臣民的数量和性格得以体现。因此，他运用统计推理的方法分析国家大事。他的分析通常都是从统治者的视角出发，而将社会成员当作可随意摆布的物品。他指出，为了对付瘟疫，应该把钱花在预防上，因为拯救生命就等于省下一笔抚养费，而国家通过拯救更多的生命可以省出数量可观的金钱。而且这种做法的回报，即使相较于最有利可图的其他投资方式，也有过之而无不及。不过配第对爱尔兰人可就没那么仁慈了。例如，他认为一个英格兰人的性命，其经济价值要大于一个爱尔兰人的性命，因此，如果除了留几个人在爱尔兰放牛，把其余爱尔兰人都强迁到英格兰，那么王国的财富可以随之增加。实事求是地说，配第自己的财富就得益于这些爱尔兰人：作为 17 世纪 50 年代入侵爱尔兰英军的随军医生，他被指派了一项任务，就是对战争造成的损失进行评估。经过仔细评估他得出的结论是，他可以从中大捞一笔，而且能安然脱身。而他也正是这样做的。

如果一如配第认为的那样，人口及其增长反映了政府的优劣，那么在缺少一个测量人口的好方法的情况下，对政府优劣的评价就会变得十分困难。正是在这个问题上，格朗特进行了他最为著名的计算，特别是对伦敦人口的计算。格朗特从死亡表中获取了出生人口的数据。结合对出生率的粗略估计，他进一步推算出育龄女性的大概数量，然后估计出家庭数量，再通过他自己观察到的伦敦家庭成员的平均人数，就能估计出全城人口。他的计算结果是 38.4 万，而之前人们都觉得这个数应该有 200 万。格朗特还证明，伦敦人口增长的主要贡献，来自从边远地区过来的移民，而非更为缓慢的人口繁衍；此外，尽管瘟疫仍然会造成恐慌，但即使是最严重的疫病所导致的人口减少，也会在两年之内有所缓和。这一结论颇为令人吃惊。此外，人们相信正是格朗特发布了历史上首份「寿命表」。时至今日，这个以系统的方式排列预期寿命数据的做法，仍被从人寿保险公司到世界卫生组织等对人们的寿命感兴趣的机构或团体使用着。表 8-1 显示了在每 100 人中能活到任意指定寿命的人数。在格朗特所列的数据（下表中标着「伦敦，1662」这一列）之外，我额外增加了某些国家现在的数据。

1662 年，格朗特在《死亡表的…… 自然与政治观察》（ Natural and Political Observations … upon the Bills of Mortality ）中发表了他的分析。该书获得了广泛赞誉。一年后，格朗特入选英国皇家学会。但在 1666 年，伦敦发生了大火。城市的很大一部分被全部烧毁，格朗特的生意也毁于一旦。为了在他的伤口上再撒一把羞辱的盐，有人指控他在大火发生前下令停止供水，所以他是火灾的帮凶。实际上，直到火灾发生之后，他才与供水公司有过联系。不管怎样，在这段插曲之后，格朗特的名字从英国皇家学会名册上消失了。几年后，格朗特死于黄疸。

很大程度上，正是由于格朗特的成果，法国才在 1667 年与英国站到了同一条战线上，修订法律给诸如死亡表这样的统计调查放行。其他欧洲国家紧随其后。到了 19 世纪，整个欧洲的统计学家，都深深地陷在诸如普查数据这样的政府记录之中，这简直就是「一场数字的大雪崩」。格朗特的贡献在于，他证明了我们可以通过仔细分析数据的有限样本，推理得出关于人群总体的结论。尽管格朗特与其他人付出了卓绝的努力，以求能够利用简单的逻辑了解数据中蕴含的信息，但要解释这些数据所隐藏的大部分秘密，还有待高斯、拉普拉斯和其他 19 世纪及 20 世纪早期的科学家所建立的工具。

「统计」一词源自德语单词 Statistik，是由《比尔菲尔德初等普及教育》（ Bielfield’s Elementary Universal Educatio ）一书 1770 年的翻译版引入英语的。书中写道：「被称为统计的这门学科告诉我们，在已知世界中的现代国家，其政治组成是怎样的。」到 1828 年，统计学科已经发生了变化，此时诺亚·韦伯斯特的《美国英语词典》（今简称《韦氏大词典》）所定义的统计学是：「有关社会状态，民族或国家中人们的情况，他们的健康状况、寿命、国内经济、艺术、财产与政治影响力以及国家的状态等事实的集合。」拉普拉斯一直都在探索，如何将他的数学分析方法的应用对象，从行星与恒星等天体扩展到日常生活，在韦伯斯特定义统计学的含义时，统计学已经将拉普拉斯的方法包含在内了。

正态分布描述了许多系统中，系统的表现围绕某中心值发生改变的行为方式，这个中心值就代表了系统最可能的输出值。在《概率的哲学导论》（ Essai philosophique sur les probabilités ）一书中，拉普拉斯声称这个新的数学分支，能用于评判法庭证言、预测结婚率、计算保险费等问题。但当该书最后一版问世时，拉普拉斯已是六十多岁了，因此继承和发扬其构想的重任，就落到了 1796 年 2 月 22 日出生于佛兰德根特的阿道夫·凯特勒这名年轻人的身上。

凯特勒的研究工作并非肇因于对社会运转方式的兴趣。1819 年为他赢得根特大学颁发的第一个数学博士学位的论文，是与圆锥曲线理论有关的一个几何学课题。然后，他的兴趣转向天文学。1820 年左右，他积极运作，以寻求在他当时任职的布鲁塞尔建立一个新天文台。在充满野心的凯特勒看来，这个天文台显然是建立一个科学帝国的第一步。他的这一步走得颇为莽撞，因为他对天文学所知不多，而对天文台运作更是几乎一无所知。但他说服别人的能力肯定相当不错，因为不仅天文台的建设得到资助，他个人也获得一笔基金，从而能够用几个月的时间到巴黎去弥补知识上的不足。结果表明，这笔投资收益显著，因为凯特勒的比利时皇家天文台直到今天仍然存在。

在巴黎，凯特勒以其独有的方式，受到了生活之无常的影响，并被命运带到一个完全不同的方向。他与统计学的罗曼史，始于与几位伟大的法国数学家的结识，其中包括拉普拉斯和约瑟夫·傅立叶。他师从傅立叶，学习了统计与概率。尽管这时他已经学会如何运作天文台，但凯特勒陷入对另一个目标的热烈追求之中，这个目标就是运用天文学中的数学工具处理社会数据。

凯特勒回到布鲁塞尔后，开始收集和分析人口统计数据，并很快将注意力集中在法国政府于 1827 年开始发布的犯罪活动记录上。在《论人类及其能力之发展》（ Sur l’homme et le développement de ses facultés ）这部发表于 1835 年的两卷本著作中，凯特勒印上了一张 1826 年至 1831 年所报道的法国各年谋杀案数量的表格。他注意到，谋杀案的数量是相对恒定的，不仅如此，每年用火枪、剑、小刀、木棒、石头、其他砍刺器具、拳脚、绳勒、溺毙和火烧等方式进行的谋杀案，它们的比例也相对恒定。凯特勒还按年龄、地域、季节、职业以及是否在医院和监狱里等因素，对死亡率进行分析。他还对酗酒、精神病和犯罪进行了统计学研究。此外，他在巴黎自缢者人数以及比利时 60 多岁老妪配 20 多岁小伙子的婚姻数量上，也发现了各自的统计规律。

统计学家之前就进行过类似的研究，但凯特勒比他们做得更多：他不仅观察了数据的平均值，还仔细研究了它们与平均值之间的偏离情况。不管研究对象是什么样的，凯特勒都遇到了正态分布：在犯罪、结婚和自杀的倾向上，在美洲原住民的身高上，乃至在苏格兰士兵的胸围测量值上（从《爱丁堡医学和外科杂志》的一篇旧文中，他得到 5738 个胸围测量数据的样本），正态分布无处不在。在为该书草稿所准备的 10 万名年轻法国人的身高中，他还发现一种现象，那就是一组数据的分布与正态分布之间的偏离，本身可能意味着一些不为人知的信息。在这些数据中，当把准备应征入伍的士兵的数量与他们的身高进行对比时，所得的钟形曲线是扭曲的：身高刚刚超过 5 英尺 2 英寸的人数比钟形曲线所预测的数量要少很多，而恰好小于这个身高的人数又太多了，就好像后者的出现是为了补偿前者的不足。凯特勒论述道，这个多出来的约 2200 个「矮子」的差异，应该是造假或善意的捏造造成的，因为身高不到 5 英尺 2 英寸的人可以免服兵役。

1-2『关键信息：一组数据的分布于正态分布之间的偏差，可能意味着不为人知的信息。做一张金句卡片。（2021-02-28）』——已完成

几十年后，伟大的法国数学家亨利·庞加莱，用凯特勒的方法逮到一个欺骗顾客的面包师。庞加莱每天都要买一条面包，买回来后，他会给面包称一下重量，结果发现这些面包的平均重量大约为 950 克，而非广告中所称的 1000 克。他向管理部门投诉了此事。之后，他买到的面包变大了些。可他还是觉得有什么地方不太对劲。凭着只有著名学者或至少是获得了终身教职的人才有的耐心，他在接下来的一年中，每天都仔细地称量面包。尽管这些面包现在的平均重量十分接近 1000 克，但如果这个面包师的确是老老实实地随机挑出一条面包卖给他，那么比这个平均重量更重些或更轻些的面包，其数量应如第 7 章所说的那样，按误差定律的钟形曲线逐渐减少。可庞加莱发现，他的面包里偏轻的比例太少，而偏重的相应过多。庞加莱由此得出结论，那个面包师其实并没有停止制作缺斤少两的面包，只不过总是拿手头最大的一条面包打发他罢了。警察再次造访了骗人的面包师，据报道所言，他表现出可想而知的震惊，并不出所料地同意改正自己的行为。

凯特勒无意中得到一个有用的发现：随机性的模式非常值得我们信赖，因此如果我们在某些社会学数据中发现它们的分布与钟形曲线不匹配，我们甚至可以把它作为证据来使用。如今，这种分析被用于凯特勒的时代不可能处理的大量数据。实际上，在近几年中，类似的统计侦察术逐渐流行，并创造了一个被称为法律经济学的新领域。在这个领域最著名的案例中，统计学研究证明，一些公司将其优先认股权的获准时间谎报为更早的时刻。这种做法的目的很简单：公司会以优先认股权（事后以认股权获准时的价格购买股票的权利）的方式激励管理人员努力推动公司股价上涨。如果认股权获准时间提前到某股价特别低的时刻，管理人员的利润就会大涨。这个点子很机灵，但是如果秘密地采取这种做法，就违反了证券法。同时，这种做法也留下了统计学意义上的「指纹」，最终导致司法部门对 10 多家大公司展开了调查。在另一个不那么出名的例子里，沃顿商学院的经济学家贾斯廷·沃尔弗斯在大约 7 万场大学篮球比赛中发现了打假球的证据。

沃尔弗斯是在比较拉斯韦加斯赌球的分差与球赛真实结果时，注意到这个不正常的地方的。对于大家看好的球队，赌球庄家会给出一个分差，引导人们以差不多对半开的比例对两支队伍下注。比如，假设大家都认为加州理工学院篮球队比加州大学洛杉矶分校篮球队要强（对于大学篮球赛的球迷们来说，是的，在 20 世纪 50 年代时的确如此），那么为了避免赌球双方获胜的机会不等，庄家只会在加州理工学院胜出加州大学洛杉矶分校 13 分以上的时候，才会付钱给那些押宝在加州理工学院的人。通过这个分差，赌博双方的输赢机会大致均等。

尽管这个分差是由庄家设定的，但实际上，它最后还是由广大赌徒确定，因为庄家会根据赌徒下注的情况调整分差，从而达到双方需求上的平衡。（庄家是从下注的钱中抽取抽头获利的，因此他们追求的就是双方所下赌注的相等，这样一来，不管比赛结果怎样，庄家都稳赚不赔。）经济学家用一个被称为预测误差的值，来衡量赌徒们对两支球队评估的准确程度，它等于被看好一方的真实胜出分差与赌博市场所设定的分差之间的差值。作为一种误差，预测误差的分布毫不令人惊讶地遵循正态分布。沃尔弗斯发现，预测误差的均值为 0，即分差既不倾向于过高评价球队，也不倾向于过低评价它们；其标准差为 10.9 分，也就是说，在大约 2/3 的比赛中，赌场设置的分差与真实比分，相差不会超过 10.9 分（在一项针对职业橄榄球赛的研究中，研究者也发现类似的结果，其均值为 0，标准差为 13.9 分）。

然后，沃尔弗斯考察了对阵双方强弱悬殊的那些比赛，他发现了一个令人吃惊的情况：在这些比赛中，强队胜出的比分恰恰超过庄家设置的分差的场次过分地少，而恰恰不到这个分差的场次又无法解释地多了许多。这又是一个凯特勒异常。与凯特勒和庞加莱一样，沃尔弗斯给出的结论是有人打假球。他的分析如下：即使是顶尖的球员，要保证球队胜出的分数比分差更多，也是十分困难的；但如果一支队伍明显强于对手，那么球员便可以在不危及球队获胜的前提下，很容易通过马虎的比赛表现，确保球队不会赢得太差的比分。因此，如果有些缺德的赌徒想要改变赌博的结果，又不想要求球员故意输掉比赛，那么结果正好是沃尔弗斯发现的这个偏离情况。那么，沃尔弗斯的结果能否证明，在一定比例的大学篮球赛中，球员们会因受贿而故意压低得分？他倒没有这么说。但沃尔弗斯也说过：「我们不能认为法庭上发生的事情，就是拉斯韦加斯发生的事情的一个如实反映。」有意思的是，在一次由美国大学体育联盟进行的调查中，1.5% 的运动员承认知道有队友「因为收了钱而故意发挥得差些」。

凯特勒并不打算把他的想法用到法庭上。他有个更宏伟的计划：利用正态分布说明人与社会的本原。他写道，如果给一尊雕像做 1000 个复制品，那么由于测量和手艺的误差，这些复制品将各有不同，而这些不同将遵循误差定律。由此推断，如果人们的物质特性遵循同样的定律，那么必然是因为我们同样是某原型的不完美复制品。凯特勒称这个原型为「平均人」。他还觉得，对人类行为而言，同样存在着一个模板。一家大百货公司的经理可能无法知道，那个好像吸毒后飘飘欲仙的出纳，会不会把他正在嗅着的那瓶半盎司 香奈儿 Allure 香水揣到自己兜里。但下面这个预测是靠得住的：在零售业中，库存商品的年损失率相当稳定地维持在 1.6% 左右，而同样稳定的是，45-48% 的损失是员工盗窃造成的。犯罪就「像一笔以令人毛骨悚然的规律性来支付的预算」，凯特勒这样写道。

凯特勒认识到，不同文化下的「平均人」也会不同，而且这个「平均人」会随着社会环境的改变而改变。实际上，研究「平均人」的改变及改变的原因，才是凯特勒最大的野心。「人遵循特定的定律出生、成长和死亡」，他这样写道，而这些定律「从未得到过研究」。牛顿认识了一套宇宙定律，并将其公式化，从而成为现代物理学之父。以牛顿为榜样的凯特勒，则希望创造一门新的「社会物理学」，以描述人类行为的定律。正如一个物体在不受干扰时会保持其运动状态一样，在凯特勒的类比中，人类群体的行为在社会环境中保持不变时，同样保持恒定状态。而且，正如牛顿描述了物理力如何使物体偏离其直线路径一样，凯特勒期望找到人类行为的定律，以描述社会力量是如何改变社会特性的。举例来说，凯特勒认为财富的巨大悬殊以及价格的巨大波动，对犯罪和社会的不稳定负有责任，而一个稳定的犯罪率水平则体现了一种平衡状态，当造成这个平衡状态的那些影响因素发生改变时，平衡状态随之改变。2001 年 9·11 恐怖袭击事件发生后的几个月，涌现出很多社会平衡发生变化的生动例子。当时，出行者由于害怕搭乘飞机而纷纷转为驾车出行。正是 9·11 恐怖袭击事件带来的人们不敢搭乘飞机的恐慌，造成了比前一年增加了约 1000 名车祸丧生者的事实，这就是 9·11 恐怖袭击事件造成的隐形伤亡。

但是，相信这样一门社会物理学的存在是一回事，真正建立起这门学科则是另一回事。凯特勒认识到，我们可以将大量的人置于实验环境中并测量其行为，然后据此检视一门真正的科学中的理论。由于这个方法实际上并不可行，所以他相信社会科学更像天文学而非物理学，也就是对社会科学理论的理解，需要通过被动的观测来获得。因此，为了发现社会物理学的定律，他对「平均人」随时间和文化的变化而变化的现象进行了研究。

人们普遍接受了凯特勒的观点，法国和英国尤其如此。一名生理学家甚至从一个不同国籍的人频繁光顾的火车站洗手间中收集尿液，以确定「平均欧洲人尿液」的性质。凯特勒在英国最热情的信徒，是名叫亨利·托马斯·巴克尔的富有的棋手和历史学家，他最为人所知的，就是他野心勃勃的多卷本著作《英国文明史》。不幸的是，1861 年巴克尔 40 岁的那年，他在大马士革旅行期间患上了斑疹伤寒。一名当地医生前来为他治病，他拒绝了，因为这个医生是个法国人，他因此病故。巴克尔未能完成他的著作，不过他还是完成了前两卷，在第一卷中，他通过统计观点阐述历史。这部分内容基于凯特勒的成果，并立刻大获成功。整个欧洲都在阅读这本书。它被译成法文、德文和俄文。达尔文读过它，阿尔弗雷德·拉塞尔·华莱士读过它，陀思妥耶夫斯基更是读了两遍。

尽管该书大受欢迎，历史却证明，凯特勒的数学成就比他的社会物理学成就更高。一方面，并非所有的社会事件都遵循正态分布，在金融领域中这一点特别明显。比如，如果电影票房遵循正态分布，那么大多数电影赚到的钱都应该落在某平均值附近，而有 2/3 的电影票房，将落在这个平均值周围一个标准差的范围内。但在电影行业中，20% 的电影带来了 80% 的票房收入。这类由热点驱动的产业，尽管完全无法预测，却遵循了一个完全不同的分布，其中均值和标准差的概念毫无意义，因为根本就没有什么「典型」的票房表现，而那些类似百万票房的例外，在一般的行当中可能几个世纪才出现一次，在电影行业中却隔几年就会发生一次。

相较于凯特勒忽略了其他类型的概率分布这个缺点，更重要的是，他未能在寻找希望的定律和驱动力的道路上前进多远。因此，他对社会物理学的直接影响是有限的。不过，他的遗产却是不可否认且意义深远的。他的遗产并不在社会科学，而在「硬」科学上。正是在这些「硬」科学中，以大量随机事件理解其中秩序的思路，启发了众多学者，产生了革命性成果，并改变了生物学和物理学的思维方式。

将统计学思想引入生物学的，是达尔文的表弟，弗朗西斯·高尔顿，他是一个闲适的人。他在 1840 年进入剑桥大学三一学院 ，先是学习医学，随后接受了达尔文的建议改学数学。当他父亲去世时，22 岁的他继承了一笔可观的财产。由于不需要靠工作来糊口，他成了一名业余科学家。他着迷于测量，他测量人们头颅的大小、鼻子的大小、四肢的长短；他测量人们在听课时坐立不安的次数；他测量那些在路上看到的女孩的吸引力（伦敦姑娘得分最高，而阿伯丁的女孩垫了底）；他测量人们指纹的特征，并最终使伦敦警察厅于 1901 年采纳了指纹识别；他甚至还测量君主和教士的寿命，结果发现他们与其他职业人群的寿命差不多，因此他得出结论，祈祷其实并没带来什么好处。

高尔顿在 1869 年《遗传的天才》一书中写道：任何身高落在给定范围内的人数占总人口的比例，应保持恒定而不随时间的改变而改变，而且身高与所有其他物理特征 —— 头颅周长、大脑大小、灰质重量、大脑纤维数量等等 —— 都遵循正态分布。他相信人的性格也由遗传决定，并如同生理特征一样，以某种方式遵循正态分布。因此，按高尔顿的话说，人「作为社会之基本单元」，并不「在投票及其他方面的能力上具有相同的价值」。相反，他断言每 100 万男人中，约有 250 人继承了某方面的特殊才能，并因此在该领域出类拔萃（在他那个年代，妇女一般不参加工作，因此他没有对妇女进行类似的分析）。高尔顿根据这些想法创建了一门新的研究领域，即优生学。优生学一词来自希腊词 eu（好）和 genos（出生）。对于后来很长时间内各种不同的人来说，优生学的含义大不相同。纳粹后来也采纳了这个术语和观点，但我们并没有证据证明高尔顿赞同德国人的杀人计划。相反，他希望能找到一种途径，通过选择性繁殖改善人类的状况。

高尔顿关于成功所给出的简单因果解释很有诱惑性，本书第 9 章的大部分内容就是为了解释其缘由。但在第 10 章我们将看到，对于任何一项可以被称为复杂内容的任务，它的实现过程都充满了无数可预见的和不可预见的障碍，因此，能力和成就之间的联系，远不如高尔顿解释的那样直接。实际上，心理学家近年来发现，对于取得成功而言，在面对困难时毫不退缩的品质，至少与天分同等重要。这也就是专家们常常提及的「10 年规则」，也就是对于多数行为而言，要想把它做得相当成功，至少需要 10 年的刻苦、练习和奋斗。勤奋与机遇跟天分同等重要，这也许令人沮丧，但我觉得我们更应该因此而振奋，因为我们虽然不能控制自身的基因组成，但努力的程度完全取决于自己。我们也能在一定程度上控制机遇的影响：只要反复尝试，就能提高成功的机会。

无论优生学是好是坏，高尔顿在遗传方面进行的研究，都引导我们发现了现代统计学的两个核心数学概念。这两个概念一个出现于 1875 年，当时高尔顿把几包甜豌豆荚分给了 7 个朋友，他们每人都收到统一大小和重量的种子，他们要做的是将种出的下一代种子还给高尔顿。高尔顿对这些种子进行测量后注意到，大个头种子产生的后代，其直径的中值比父代种子小，而小个头种子产生的后代比父代更大。后来，从在伦敦所建的实验室获得的数据中，他发现人类父母和子女身高上也存在同样的情况。他将这种现象称为回归，即在相关联的测量中，如果一个测量值远离均值，那么另一个测量值将会更接近均值。

高尔顿很快意识到，如果一个过程没有这样的回归行为，那么这个过程将不可避免地失控。举例来说，假设高个子爸爸的儿子，平均而言与父亲一样高。既然身高各有不同，那么某些儿子就会比爸爸更高。到了下一代，假定这些更高的儿子，他们的儿子，即开始那群人的孙子，平均而言也跟他们的父亲一样高，其中又有某些人同样会高过他们的父亲。一代又一代之后，人类中最高的人将变得越来越高。但由于回归的存在，这种情况并没有发生。同样的论述也可用于与生俱来的智力、艺术才能或打高尔夫球的技术等方面。因此，个头很高的父母不应该指望孩子长得同样高，非常聪明的父母不应该指望孩子同样聪明，而毕加索们和泰格·伍兹们也不应该指望自己的孩子取得跟他们一样的成就。另一方面，非常矮的父母却可以期待后代会更高些，而我们这些并不聪明或不善于画画的人，也有理由期待这些方面的无能将被下一代改变。

高尔顿用广告为实验室招徕受试者，然后对他们进行一系列身高、体重乃至特定骨骼尺寸的测量。他希望发现一种根据父母的测量值预测孩子对应的测量值的方法。为了找到这种方法，高尔顿绘制了各种图形，其中之一就是以父母的身高为孩子的身高作图。打个比方，如果父母和孩子的身高总是相等，就应该得到一条呈 45 度的直线。如果这种关系平均来说是成立的，但个别数据点可能有变化，该图就会表现出某些点落在这条直线上方，而另一些落在下方。用这种方式，高尔顿的图不但显示了父母和子女身高之间的一般关系，而且显示了这种关系存在的程度。这就是高尔顿对统计学所做的另一大贡献：他定义了一种数学指标，用来描述类似关系的质量。该指标被称为相关系数。

相关系数是取值在 -1 到 1 之间的一个数。如果相关系数很接近 1 或 -1，就表明两个变量很好地遵循线性关系；相关系数为 0 则表示两者不相关。打个比方，如果数据显示每周吃一次麦当劳最新推出的 1000 卡路里 的套餐，一年下来体重会增加 10 磅；如果吃两次，就会增加 20 磅，以此类推，那么这时的相关系数为 1。如果由于某种原因，吃这个套餐的人不是增重，而是减掉同样的体重，那么相关系数为 -1。如果增加和减少的体重的值五花八门，并不依赖于吃了几次套餐，那么相关系数为 0。今天，相关系数已经成为统计学中使用最广泛的概念之一。人们用它评估诸如吸烟量和癌症的发生、恒星距地球的距离和它们远离我们的速度、学生在标准化考试中所得分数和他们的家庭收入等的关系。

高尔顿的成果十分重要，其重要性不仅体现在它的直接应用上，而且体现在它促成了随后几十年统计学所取得的进展上。正是在这段时期内，统计学迅速发展成为一门成熟的学科，而其中最重要的进展之一，是由高尔顿的信徒皮尔逊完成的。在本章早些时候，我曾给出许多遵循正态分布的数据类型。但对于容量有限的数据集而言，数据的分布不可能与正态分布曲线完美匹配。在统计学的早期，科学家们简单地将数据绘制成图，然后观察所得曲线的形状，以此判断这些数据是否遵循正态分布。但这个曲线匹配的精确程度我们该如何量化呢？皮尔逊发明了一种被称为 $χ^2$ 检验的方法，它可以确定一个数据集是否确实遵循我们所认为的那个分布。

2『$χ^2$ 检验方法，做一张术语卡片。（2021-02-28）』——已完成

1892 年 7 月，他在蒙特卡洛演示了这个检验方法。他的测试可以被看作贾格尔当年事迹的照搬。正如贾格尔那时碰到的情形一样，在皮尔逊的测试中，轮盘赌开出的数字并不遵循他所希望的分布，即轮盘产生的结果确实是随机时所应遵循的分布。在另一次测试中，皮尔逊观察了 12 枚骰子的 26306 次投掷，并统计了每把扔出 5 点与 6 点的数量。他发现这个分布同样不满足使用完美骰子进行公平赌赛时应该得到的分布 —— 在公平的情况下，一枚骰子扔出 5 点或 6 点的概率是 1/3，或 0.3333；但实际的分布却表明，这个概率似乎是 0.3377。换言之，骰子有问题。对于轮盘赌而言，这可能是有人暗中操纵的结果，但骰子的问题很可能出在制造过程中，正如我的朋友莫希强调的那样，这种不完美性总是存在着。

今天，$χ^2$ 检验得到广泛运用。假设现在我们检验的不是骰子，而是消费者对三种麦片的喜好程度。如果消费者没有特殊的偏好，那么可以期望，每盒麦片都会被近 1/3 的消费者选购。正如我们已经看到的，真实结果很难如此均匀地分布。这时我们就可以使用 $χ^2$ 检验来确定，那盒得票最多的麦片，确实是因为消费者的喜爱而非凑巧胜出的可能性有多大。与此类似，如果一家制药公司的研究人员想要测试两种用于防治急性器官移植排斥反应的治疗方法，就可以通过 $χ^2$ 检验确定两者是否存在显著性差异。再或者，在一个新的租车店开张之前，租车公司的首席财务官会认为有 25% 的顾客想租用微型汽车，50% 的想租小型汽车，还分别有 12.5% 的需要中型或其他类型的汽车。那么等到租赁数据逐渐累积起来之后，$χ^2$ 检验就能帮助这位首席财务官迅速判断之前的假设是否正确。如果新店是个偏离典型情况的例外，那么公司最好把这个店不同的车型做一下调整。

凯特勒的成果由高尔顿引入生物科学。但凯特勒同样对物理科学中一次革命性的发展做出了贡献：统计物理学创建者中的两位，詹姆斯·克拉克·麦克斯韦和路德维希·玻尔兹曼，他们都从凯特勒的理论中获得过灵感（跟达尔文和陀思妥耶夫斯基一样，他们是在巴克尔的书中读到这些内容的）。不管怎样，如果 5738 名苏格兰士兵的胸围能很好地按正态曲线分布，而 2 亿名司机每年驾驶里程之间的差距可以小到 100 英里，那么在想到一升气体中那 10^24 左右的分子会表现出某些有趣的规律性这一点上，就不需要一个爱因斯坦的大脑了。但为了让科学界最终接受这个物理学新方法的必要性，我们还是需要一位爱因斯坦。阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦完成这个任务是在 1905 年，也就是他发表第一篇关于相对论论文的那一年。尽管主流媒体对此知之甚少，但爱因斯坦 1905 年的那篇关于统计物理学的文章，跟他的相对论论文一样具有革命性意义。实际上，它是他在科学界被引用次数最多的论文。

爱因斯坦 1905 年关于统计物理学的论文，其写作目的是希望解释一种被称为布朗运动的现象。该过程以罗伯特·布朗的名字命名。布朗是一名植物学家，是使用显微镜的世界级专家，而且被认为是第一个对细胞核做出清晰描述的人。布朗孜孜不倦地追求着他的生活目标，那就是通过观察发现生命力的来源。在当时，人们相信这个所谓生命力是一种神秘的作用力，那些有生命者具有的那种性质，就是由这个生命力赋予的。在这一追求中，布朗注定要失败，但在 1827 年 6 月的一天，他认为自己成功了。

透过镜头，布朗注意到，他所观察的花粉颗粒内部的微粒似乎在动。尽管花粉是一种生命之源，但它本身不是什么有生命的物体。不过不管布朗盯上多久，这些微粒的运动都不曾停止，就好像它们拥有某种神秘的能量。这个运动似乎没有特定的目的地，实际上，运动看起来完全是随机的。无比激动的布朗马上得出结论，他已经找到他孜孜以求的东西，因为除了驱动生命本身的能量，这还能是什么别的东西吗？

在接下来的一个月里，布朗勤勉有加地进行了一系列实验，并发现所有他能搞到手的各色有机小颗粒在悬浮于水中或杜松子酒中时，都有着同样的运动，这些小颗粒包括经过分解的小牛肉纤维，「被伦敦的灰尘染黑的」蜘蛛网，甚至他自己的黏液，等等。接着，他一意孤行的解释遭到致命一击：当他用石棉、铜、铋、锑和锰之类的无机小颗粒进行实验时，也观察到同样的运动。这让他认识到，他看到的运动根本与生命无关。后来的进展证明，布朗运动产生的真实原因，并非某个实在的物理力，而是由随机模式产生的虚拟力。它与那个凯特勒注意到的强迫人类行为有规律性的力是相同的。不幸的是，当布朗运动的正确解释出现时，布朗已经不在人世了。

在布朗发现布朗运动之后的数十年间，玻尔兹曼、麦克斯韦与其他学者打下了理解布朗运动的基础。他们受到凯特勒观点的启发，建立了统计物理学这个新领域，用概率与统计的数学思想，解释构成流体的（当时仍然是假想的）原子的运动是如何造就流体性质的。但在之后的几十年中，这些想法并未取得什么进展。某些科学家对该理论所使用的数学工具心存疑虑；其他人则因为从未见过或根本不相信有人能见到这个所谓的原子而反对该理论。但大多数物理学家都是实用主义者，对于这种原则性的东西倒不是那么在意。可以说，该理论未被接受，最主要的原因就是它虽然能推导出若干已知的流体定律，却没有给出可验证的预言。事情就这么被拖到了 1905 年，这时麦克斯韦过世已久，而沮丧的玻尔兹曼也离自杀不远了。爱因斯坦使用这个新生的理论，通过详尽的数学公式，解释了布朗运动的准确机制。从此以后，不再有人对在物理学中使用统计学方法的必要性存有疑问，而物质是由原子和分子组成的观点，将成为大多数现代技术的基础，同时也成为物理学史上最为重要的思想之一。

正如我们将在第 10 章见到的那样，流体中分子的随机运动，可以成为我们自己的生命之路的一个类比。因此，爱因斯坦的工作值得我们多花点儿时间仔细看看。在原子论描绘的图景中，水分子的基本运动是完全杂乱无章的。分子先是沿着这条路径运动，然后沿着另一条路径飞走。它将保持直线运动，直到与另一个分子相撞改变自己的前进方向。本书前言已经提到过，这种路径 —— 在不同的时间和方向上是随机变化的 —— 常常被称为醉汉的脚步。那些喝了太多马提尼酒的人，都能非常清楚地理解这个名字的由来（不过头脑更冷静的数学家和科学家有时称其为「随机漫步」）。按原子理论的预测，如果悬浮于液体中的颗粒不断地被液体分子随机轰击，那么可以预计，颗粒将因为这些碰撞，一会儿朝这儿一会儿朝那儿动来动去。但布朗运动的这种解释存在两个问题：首先，相较于可见的悬浮颗粒，分子实在太小了，无法推动颗粒移动；其次，分子的碰撞远比所观察到的颗粒晃动要来得频繁。爱因斯坦的天才想法部分在于，他认识到这两者其实会相互抵消：尽管碰撞发生得非常频繁，但由于分子如此之轻，以至这些频繁而独立的碰撞不会产生明显的影响。只有在某些时候，纯粹的运气使得某方向上的撞击更占优势，才会发生足以使人注意的晃动，就好像分子世界中的马里斯创纪录之年一样。爱因斯坦通过计算发现，尽管在分子层面上看来是一片混沌，但在分子的参数（大小、数量和速度等）和可观察的颗粒晃动的频率与幅度之间，存在着可预测的数学关系。于是有史以来头一遭，新的可观测的结果与统计物理学被爱因斯坦联系在一起。虽然我这里说得好像这个成就不过是一些纯粹的技术性问题，但实际恰恰相反，爱因斯坦的这项成果是一个伟大原则的胜利：在众多我们能感知的自然界秩序的掩饰之下，其实都是不可见的无序，只有通过随机性的法则，我们才能理解这些表面上的秩序。正如爱因斯坦所言：「能认识到那些看上去与直接可见的真理相去甚远的现象，其实具有统一性，这种感觉无比美好。」

2『这里的信息知道了为啥本书名为「醉汉的脚步」。做一张主题卡片。（2021-02-28）』

在爱因斯坦的数学推导中，正态分布再次扮演了核心角色，并达到它在科学史上新的辉煌地位。醉汉的脚步就此确立了它的地位，即成为最具基础性并很快得到最多研究的自然过程之一。等到各领域的科学家承认了统计学方法的正统地位后，在几乎所有的领域，他们都发现了醉汉的脚步存在的证据，如在清理非洲丛林以消灭蚊虫的研究中，在制造尼龙的化学反应中，在塑料的形成过程中，在自由量子粒子的运动中，在股票价格的变化中，甚至在千古以来的智力进化中，都是如此。在第 10 章，我们将一起来看一看，随机性对我们自身的生命之路造成了哪些影响。正如我们将要看到的那样，尽管随机变化中存在着有规律的模式，但并非所有模式都是有意义的。当模式中存在意义时，我们应该去发现它。同样重要的是，当模式实际上并无意义时，我们就不该试图去抽取什么「意义」。要避免对随机模式产生「有意义」的错觉，可不是件容易的事情，而这构成了本书下一章的主题。
