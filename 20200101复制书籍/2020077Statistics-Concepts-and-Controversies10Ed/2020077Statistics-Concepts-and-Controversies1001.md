Case Study: Leading Causes of Death

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) produces a report each year summarizing leading causes of death, changes in mortality over time, and other characteristics for mortality in the United States. From its November 2017 brief「Death: Final Data for 2015,」along with its report on the「10 Leading Causes of Death by Age Group–2015,」Figure 10.1 was constructed to display the top five causes of death for four age categories. A clear graphical display can tell us a story about a data set and can show us how multiple variables are related. It can also make it easy for policy- and decision-makers to decide how to allocate resources for prevention or intervention. For instance, a quick glance at the pie chart for ages 1–24 shows that a large portion, 15% of deaths in that age range, is attributed to suicide. A clear display of this staggering number makes a strong argument for allocation of resources.

Figure 10.1 Top five causes of death compared across four age categories. (Data from Murphy, SL, Xu, J, Kochanek, KD, et al. Deaths: Final data for 2015.

Statistics deals with data, and we use tables and graphs to present data. Tables and graphs help us see what the data say. But not all tables and graphs do so accurately or clearly. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to determine whether Figure 10.1 is a good or a bad graphic.

Data Tables

Take a look at the Statistical Abstract of the United States, an annual volume packed with almost every variety of numerical information. Has the number of private elementary and secondary schools grown over time? What about minority enrollments in these schools? How many college degrees were given in each of the past several years, and how were these degrees divided among fields of study and by the age, race, and sex of the students? You can find all this and more in the education section of the Statistical Abstract. The tables summarize data. We don’t want to see information on every college degree individually, only the counts in categories of interest to us.

Example 1

What makes a clear table?

How well educated are adults? Table 10.1 presents the data for people aged 25 years and over. This table illustrates some good practices for data tables. It is clearly labeled so that we can see the subject of the data at once. The main heading describes the general subject of the data and gives the date because these data will change over time. Labels within the table identify the variables and state the units in which they are measured. Notice, for example, that the counts are in thousands. The source of the data appears at the foot of the table. This Census Bureau publication, in fact, presents data from our old friend, the Current Population Survey.

Table 10.1 Education of people aged 25 years and over in 2017

Level of education Number of persons (thousands) Percent

Less than high school 22,540 10.4

High school graduate 62,512 28.8

Some college, no degree 35,455 16.4

Associate’s degree 22,310 10.3

Bachelor’s degree 46,262 21.3

Advanced degree 27,841 12.8

Total 216,921 100.0

Data from Census Bureau, Educational Attainment in the United States: 2017.

Key Terms

The distribution of a variable tells us what values it takes and how often it takes these values.

Table 10.1 starts with the counts of people aged 25 years and over who have attained each level of education. Rates (percentages or proportions) are often clearer than counts—it is more helpful to hear that 10.4% of this age group did not finish high school than to hear that there are 22,540,000 such people. The percentages also appear in Table 10.1. The last two columns of the table present the distribution of the variable「level of education」in two alternate forms. Each of these columns gives information about what values the variable takes and how often it takes each value.

Example 2

Roundoff errors

Did you check Table 10.1 for consistency? The total number of people should be

But the table gives the total as 216,921. What happened? Each entry is rounded to the nearest thousand. The rounded entries don’t quite add to the total, which is rounded separately. Such roundoff errors will be with us from now on as we do more arithmetic.

It is not uncommon to see roundoff errors in tables. For example, when table entries are percentages, the total may sum to a value slightly different from 100%, often to 99.9 or 100.1%. When table entries are proportions, the total may sum to a value slightly different from 1, such as 0.99 or 1.01.

Types of Variables

When we think about graphs, it is helpful to distinguish between variables that place individuals into categories (such as gender, occupation, or education level) and those whose values have a meaningful numerical scale (such as height in centimeters or SAT scores).

Key Terms

A categorical variable places an individual into one of several groups or categories.

A quantitative variable takes numerical values for which arithmetic operations such as adding and averaging make sense. A quantitative variable is also sometimes referred to as a numerical variable.

Pie Charts and Bar Graphs

The variable displayed in Table 10.1,「level of education,」is a categorical variable. There are six possible values of the variable. To picture this distribution in a graph, we might use a pie chart. Figure 10.2 is a pie chart of the level of education of people aged 25 years and over. Pie charts show how a whole is divided into parts. To make a pie chart, first draw a circle. The circle represents the whole, in this case all people aged 25 years and over. Wedges within the circle represent the parts, with the angle spanned by each wedge in proportion to the size of that part. For example, 21.3% of those in this age group and over have a bachelor’s degree but not an advanced degree. Because there are 360 degrees in a circle, the「bachelor’s degree」wedge spans an angle of

Pie charts force us to see that the parts do make a whole. However, it is much easier for our eyes to compare the heights of the bars on a bar graph than it is to compare the size of the angles on a pie chart.

Figure 10.2 Pie chart of the distribution of highest level of education among persons aged 25 years and over in 2017.

Data are as follows.

Less than high school, 10.4 percent

High school graduate, 28.8 percent

Some college, no degree, 16.4 percent

Associate’s degree, 10.3 percent

Bachelor’s degree, 21.3 percent

Advanced degree, 12.8 percent

Figure 10.3 is a bar graph of the same data. There is a single bar for each education level. The height of each bar shows the percentage of people aged 25 years and over who have attained that highest level of education. Notice that each bar has the same width—this is always the case with a bar graph. Also, there is a space between the bars. It is obvious on either the pie chart or bar graph that the largest category is「High school graduate.」However, smaller differences are much more subtle on a pie chart. It is very clear on the bar graph that「Bachelor’s degree」is the second largest category. This is not as clear on the pie chart. Bar graphs are better for making comparisons of the sizes of categories. In addition, if there is a natural ordering of the variable, such as how much education a person has, this order can be displayed along the horizontal axis of the bar graph but cannot be displayed in an obvious way in a pie chart.

Figure 10.3 Bar graph of the distribution of highest level of education among persons aged 25 years and over in 2017.

The horizontal axis, labeled Education Level shows six different levels of education and the vertical axis, labeled Percent ranges from 0 to 30 in intervals of 5 units. Data in the graph are as follows.

Less than high school, 10.4 percent

High school graduate, 28.8 percent

Some college, no degree, 16.4 percent

Associate’s degree, 10.3 percent

Bachelor’s degree, 21.3 percent

Advanced degree, 12.8 percent

The data given are approximate.

Pie charts and bar graphs can show the distribution (either counts or percentages) of a categorical variable such as highest level of education. A pie chart usually displays the percentage for each category (rather than the count) and only works if you have all the categories (the percentages add to 100%). A bar graph can display an entire distribution or can be used to display only a few categories. A bar graph can also compare the size of categories that are not parts of one whole. If you have one number to represent each category, you can use a bar graph.

Example 3

High taxes?

Figure 10.4 compares the level of taxation in eight democratic nations. Each democratic nation is a category and each category is described by one value, so a bar graph is a good choice for a graphical display of these data. The heights of the bars show the percentages of each nation’s gross domestic product (GDP, the total value of all goods and services produced) that is taken in taxes. Americans accustomed to complaining about high taxes may be surprised to see that the United States, at 25.4% of GDP, is at the bottom of the group. Notice that a pie chart is not possible for these data since we are displaying eight separate quantities, not the parts of a whole.

Figure 10.4 Total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in eight countries that are part of the OECD, Example 3. (Data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, https://data.oecd.org/tax/tax-revenue.htm.)

The horizontal axis, labeled Country shows eight different countries. The vertical axis, labeled Tax revenue (percentage of GDP) ranges from 0 to 50 in intervals of 10 units. Data in the graph are as follows.

Canada, 31 percent.

France, 45 percent.

Germany, 37 percent.

Italy, 42 percent.

Sweden, 43 percent.

Switzerland, 28 percent.

U K, 33 percent.

U S A, 25 percent.

The data given are approximate.

Now it’s your turn

10.1 Taxes. There are currently seven states in the United States that do not collect income tax. The table below contains the combined state and average local sales tax in 2018 for these seven states as computed by the Tax Foundation.

State State and average local sales tax (%)

Alaska 1.76

Florida 6.80

Nevada 8.14

South Dakota 6.40

Texas 8.17

Washington 9.18

Wyoming 5.46

Is the variable「state」categorical or quantitative? Should you use a pie chart or a bar graph to display the state and average local sales tax for these states? Why?

Example 4

Government tax revenue breakdown

Governments generate tax revenue through various means. In its 2018 report, the Tax Foundation analyzed data for 2015 from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The United States’ tax revenue is comprised of individual income tax (40.5%), social insurance tax (23.7%), consumption tax (17.0%), property tax (10.3%), and corporate income tax (8.5%). A bar graph is appropriate to display these data since we have one value to explain the size of each tax category. Notice, a pie graph is appropriate as well since these are all the parts of a whole. What if we wanted to compare the distribution of tax revenue for the United States to the average for all the other OECD countries? Pie charts are not good for comparisons. Figure 10.5 is a bar graph for the distribution of government tax revenue for the United States with a second set of bars representing the average for all other OECD nations adjacent to the bars for the United States. This is called a side-by-side bar graph. A side-by-side bar graph is useful for making comparisons. It is now clear that the United States relies more heavily on individual income tax, while the other countries rely more heavily on consumption taxes.

Figure 10.5 Side-by-side bar graph comparing the distribution for sources of government tax revenue in 2015 for the United States to the average of all other countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Example 4. (Data from OECD, StatExtrats, http:stats.oecd.org.)

Beware the Pictogram

Bar graphs compare several quantities by means of the differing heights of bars that represent the quantities. Our eyes, however, react to the area of the bars as well as to their height. When all bars have the same width, the area (width × height) varies in proportion to the height and our eyes receive the right impression. When you draw a bar graph, make the bars equally wide. Artistically speaking, bar graphs are a bit dull. It is tempting to replace the bars with pictures for greater eye appeal.

Example 5

A misleading graph

Figure 10.6 is a pictogram. It is a bar graph in which pictures replace the bars. The graph is aimed at consumers shopping for a vacuum. It claims that a Dyson vacuum has more than twice the suction of any other vacuum. Although not clearly labeled, type of vacuum is shown along the x axis or horizontal axis, and the y axis or vertical axis, gives the calculated number of air watts for each vacuum. We see the Dyson vacuum (far right) has roughly 4 times the air watts (160 is roughly 4 times 43) of the vacuum on the far left. However, this graphic makes it appear as though there is a much larger difference. Why is this?

Figure 10.6 Advertisement found on Dyson’s website for vacuum cleaners claiming a Dyson vacuum has more than twice the suction of any other vacuum, Example 5. (From For All Practical Purposes: Mathematical Literacy in Today’s World, 10e by COMAP. Copyright 2016 W.H. Freeman and Company. All rights reserved. Used by permission of the publisher Macmillan Learning.)

The vertical axis shows Air watts, with values ranging from 0 to 160, in increments of 20 units. The vacuum cleaner on the far left is the smallest and has a value of 43 Air watts; the vacuum cleaner in the center is slightly bigger and has a value of 68 Air watts, and the vacuum cleaner on the far right is the biggest and has a largest value of 160 Air watts.

To magnify a picture, the artist must increase both height and width to avoid distortion of the image. By increasing both the height and width of the Dyson vacuum, it appears to be times larger. Remember a bar graph should have bars of equal width—only the heights of the bars should vary. Replacing the bars on a bar graph with pictures is tempting, but it is difficult to keep the「bar」width equal without distorting the picture.

Change Over Time: Line Graphs

Key Terms

A line graph of a quantitative variable plots each observation against the time at which it was measured. Always put time on the horizontal axis of your plot and the variable you are measuring on the vertical axis. Connect the data points by lines to display the change over time.

Many quantitative variables are measured at intervals over time. We might, for example, measure the height of a growing child or the price of a stock at the end of each month. In these examples, our main interest is change over time. To display how a quantitative variable changes over time, make a line graph.

When constructing a line graph, make sure to use equally spaced time intervals on the horizontal axis to avoid distortion. Line graphs can also be used to show how a quantitative variable changes over time, broken down according to some other categorical variable. Use a separate line for each category.

Example 6

Unemployment by education level

How has unemployment changed over time? Figure 10.7 is a line graph of the monthly national unemployment rate, by education level, for the United States from July 2008 through July 2018. For example, the unemployment rate for July 2009 was 15.3% for those with less than a high school diploma, 9.5% for those with a high school diploma, 8.0% for those with some college, and 4.8% for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher.

Figure 10.7 Monthly unemployment rate for four education categories from July 2008 through July 2018 reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Example 6. (Data from https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm#.)

The horizontal axis, labeled Year has values ranging from 2008 to 2018, in increments of 1 year. The vertical axis, labeled Unemployment rate (percentage) ranges from 0 to 16 in intervals of 2 units. Data in the graph are as follows.

The unemployment rate of people whose educational level is less than high school starts at about 8.5 percent in the beginning of 2008 and climbs to 15 percent in the mid of 2009 and then steeply falls to 5 percent in 2018.

The unemployment rate of people who have studied high school starts at about 5.5 percent in the beginning of 2008 and climbs to 11 percent in the beginning of 2009, it gradually falls to 5 percent in 2018.

The unemployment rate of people who have some college education starts at about 4.5 percent in 2008 and climbs to about 8.5 percent in 2010. It makes a significant change in 2012 as it falls from7 percent to 3 percent in 2018.

The unemployment rate of people who have graduated with a Bachelor’s degree or higher, starts at 2.5 percent and slightly rises to about 4.5 percent through the years 2009 to 2010; and then steeply falls to 2.5 percent in 2018.

The data given are approximate.

It would be difficult to see patterns in a long table of numbers. Figure 10.7 makes the patterns clear. What should we look for?

First, look for an overall pattern. For example, a trend is a long-term upward or downward movement over time. Unemployment was at its highest for all education groups in 2009 and 2010, due to the Great Recession. Since then, the overall trend is showing a decrease in the unemployment rate for all education levels (each line is generally decreasing).

Statistics in Your World

The Vietnam Effect Folklore says that during the Vietnam War, many men went to college to avoid being drafted. Statistician Howard Wainer looked for traces of this「Vietnam effect」by plotting data against time. He found that scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (an IQ test given to recruits) dipped sharply during the war, then rebounded. Scores on the SAT exams, taken by students applying to college, also dropped at the beginning of the war. It appears that the men who chose college over the army lowered the average test scores in both places.

Next, look for striking deviations from the overall pattern. There is a noticeable increase from 2008 to the beginning of 2009. This was a side effect of the recession economy. Unemployment hovered around these record highs through 2010, when the rates finally started their decline to the current levels. There is a striking deviation in the unemployment rate for those with less than a high school degree around mid-2010. As the overall pattern of generally decreasing begins, there is a much more drastic dip in mid-2010 for those with less than a high school degree.

Change over time often has a regular pattern of seasonal variation that repeats each year. Calculating the unemployment rate depends on the size of the workforce and the number of those in the workforce who are working. For example, the unemployment rate rises every year in January as holiday sales jobs end and outdoor work slows in the north due to winter weather. It would cause confusion (and perhaps political trouble) if the government’s official unemployment rate jumped every January. These are regular and predictable changes in unemployment. As such, the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes seasonal adjustments to the monthly unemployment rate before reporting it to the general public.

Key Terms

A pattern that repeats itself at known regular intervals of time is called seasonal variation. Many series of regular measurements over time are seasonally adjusted. That is, the expected seasonal variation is removed before the data are published.

The line graph of Figure 10.7 shows the unemployment rate for four different education levels. A line graph may have only one line or more than one, as was the case in Figure 10.7. Picturing the unemployment rate for all four groups over this time period gives an additional message. We see that unemployment is always lower with more education—a strong argument for a college education! Also, the increase in unemployment was much more drastic during the Great Recession for the lower education levels. It appears that the unemployment rate is much more stable for those with higher education and much more variable for those with lower education levels.

Now it’s your turn

10.2 Gasoline prices. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) keeps track of weekly and monthly average gasoline and diesel prices across the United States. The table below gives the average regular-grade gasoline prices for the month of August, from 1996 to 2018.

1996 1.21 2008 2.78

1997 1.22 2009 2.68

1998 1.03 2010 2.73

1999 1.22 2011 3.64

2000 1.47 2012 3.72

Make a line graph of these data and comment on any patterns you observe.

Watch Those Scales!

Because graphs speak so strongly, they can mislead the unwary. The careful reader of a line graph looks closely at the scales marked off on the axes.

Example 7

Living together

The number of unmarried couples living together has increased in recent years, to the point that some people say that cohabitation is delaying or even replacing marriage. Figure 10.8 presents two line graphs of the number of unmarried-couple households in the United States. The data once again come from the Current Population Survey. The graph on the left suggests a steady but moderate increase. The right-hand graph says that cohabitation is thundering upward.

Figure 10.8 The effect of changing the scales in a line graph, Example 7. Both graphs plot the same data, but the right-hand graph makes the increase appear much more rapid.

The horizontal axis shows Year, with values ranging from 1975 to 2010 in increments of 5 years. The vertical axis shows Unmarried couples (thousands) with values ranging from 1000 to 8000 in increments of 1000 units. Data in the graph on the left is as follows.

The number of unmarried couples (in thousands) in the year 1977 is about 950; it then steeply climbs to about 5000 in 2007 and climbs further to 7600 beyond the year 2010.

The horizontal axis shows Year, with values ranging from 1980 to 2010 in increments of 10 years. The vertical axis shows Unmarried couples (thousands) with values ranging from 1000 to 8000 in increments of 1000 units. Data in the graph on the right is as follows.

The number of unmarried couples (in thousands) in the year 1977 is about 950, the climb is shown as steeper and longer; the number reaches 2000 in 1986 and climbs further in a steep diagonal manner to 3700 in 1995. From this point, the line makes a drastic climb to 6700 in 2008 and ends at 7600 beyond the year 2010.The graph therefore displays an elongated steep line with a steady rise.

The data given are approximate.

The secret is in the scales. You can transform the left-hand graph into the right-hand graph by stretching the vertical scale, squeezing the horizontal scale, and cutting off the vertical scale just above and below the values to be plotted. Now you know how to either exaggerate or play down a trend in a line graph.

Which graph is correct? Both are accurate graphs of the data, but both have scales chosen to create a specific effect. Because there is no one「right」scale for a line graph, correct graphs can give different impressions by their choices of scale. Watch those scales!

Another important issue concerning scales is the following. When examining the change in the price or value of an item over time, plotting the actual increase can be misleading. It is often better to plot the percentage increase from the previous period.

Example 8

Getting rich in hindsight

The end of the twentieth century saw a great bull market (a period when the value of stocks rises) in U.S. common stocks. How great? Pictures tell the tale more clearly than words.

Look first at Figure 10.9. This shows the percentage increase or decrease in stocks (measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 index) in each year from 1971 to 2017. Until 1982, stock prices bounce up and down. Sometimes they go down a lot—stocks lost 14.7% of their value in 1973 and another 26.5% in 1974. But starting in 1982, stocks go up in 17 of the next 18 years, often by a lot. From 2000 to 2009 stocks again bounce up and down, with a large loss of 37% in the recession that began in 2008.

Figure 10.9 Percentage increase or decrease in the S&P 500 index of common stock prices, 1971 to 2017, Example 8.

The horizontal axis is labeled Year with values ranging from ’71 to ‘17 in increments of 2 years. The vertical axis is labeled Percentage increase or decrease with values ranging from negative 40 to positive 40. Data in the graph are as follows.

1971, 14 percent; 1972, 18 percent; 1973, negative 15 percent; 1974, negative 28 percent; 1975, 38 percent; 1976, 24 percent; 1977, negative 5 percent; 1978, 5 percent; 1979, 18 percent; 1980, 34 percent; 1981, negative 3 percent; 1982, 22 percent; 1983, 24 percent; 1984, 4 percent; 1985, 32 percent; 1986, 20 percent; 1987, 4 percent; 1988, 17 percent; 1989, 30 percent; 1990, negative 4 percent; 1991, 32 percent; 1992, 8 percent; 1993, 10 percent; 1994, 1 percent; 1995, 35 percent; 1996, 22 percent; 1997, 32 percent; 1998, 28 percent; 1999, 20 percent; 2000, negative 10 percent; 2001, negative 12 percent; 20002, negative 20 percent; 2003, negative 25 percent; 2004, 20 percent; 2005, 4 percent; 2006, 15 percent; 2007, 5 percent; 2008, negative 38 percent; 2009, 24 percent; 2010, 15 percent; 2011, 2 percent; 2012, 16 percent; 2013, 32 percent; 2014, 14 percent; 2015, 1 percent; 2016, 12 percent; 2017, 22 percent.

The data given are approximate.

Figure 10.10 shows, in hindsight, how you could have become rich in the period from 1971 to 1999. If you had invested $1000 in stocks at the end of 1970, the graph shows how much money you would have had at the end of each of the following years. After 1974, your $1000 was down to $853, and at the end of 1981, it had grown to only $2145. That’s an increase of only 7.2% a year. Then the great bull market begins its work. By the end of 1999, it would have turned your $1000 into $36,108. Over the next 18 years as a whole, stocks again bounced up and down, and by the end of 2017, your $1000 would have turned into $117,290.

Figure 10.10 Value at the end of each year, 1971 to 2017, of $1000 invested in the S&P 500 index at the end of 1970, Example 8.

The horizontal axis is labeled Year with values ranging from 1970 to 2015 in increments of 5 years. The vertical axis is labeled Value of $1000 investment made in 1970 and has values ranging from 20000 to 120000. Data in the graph are as follows.

The value starts at a value of 1000 in 1971 and makes a steep climb to 50,000 in 1998; it drops back to 30,000 in 2007 after a few ups and downs and finally ends at 100000 beyond the year 2015.

The data given here are approximate.

Figures 10.9 and 10.10 are instructive. For example, Figure 10.10 might give the impression that increases between 1970 and 1980 were negligible but that increases between 1995 and 1999 were dramatic. While it is true that the actual value of our investment increased much more between 1995 and 1999 than it did between 1970 and 1980, it would be incorrect to conclude that investments in general increased much more dramatically between 1995 and 1999 than in any of the years between 1970 and 1980.

Figure 10.9 tells a different, and more accurate, story. For example, the percentage increase in 1975 (approximately 37%) rivaled that in any of the years between 1995 and 1999. However, in 1975 the actual value of our investment was relatively small ($1170) and a 37% increase in such a small amount is nearly imperceptible on the scale used in Figure 10.10. By 1995, the actual value of our investment was about $14,000, and a 37% increase appears much more striking.

This might be a good place to read the「What’s the verdict?」story on page 241, and to answer the questions. These questions ask you to assess a graph that appeared in a Reuters News story.

Making Good Graphs

Graphs are the most effective way to communicate using data. A good graph will reveal facts about the data that would be difficult or impossible to detect from a table. What is more, the immediate visual impression of a graph is much stronger than the impression made by data in numerical form. Here are some principles for making good graphs:

Make sure labels and legends tell what variables are plotted, their units, and the source of the data.

Make the data stand out. Be sure that the actual data, not labels, grids, or background art, catch the viewer’s attention. You are drawing a graph, not a piece of creative art.

Pay attention to what the eye sees. Avoid pictograms and be careful choosing scales. Avoid fancy「three-dimensional」effects that confuse the eye without adding information. Ask if a simple change in a graph would make the message clearer.

Example 9

The rise in college education

Figure 10.11 shows the rise in the percentage of women aged 25 years and over who have at least a bachelor’s degree. There are only five data points, so a line graph should be simple. Figure 10.11 isn’t simple. The artist couldn’t resist a nice background sketch and also cluttered the graph with grid lines. We find it harder than it should be to see the data. Using pictures of the female graduate at each time point distorts the values in the same way as a pictogram. Grid lines on a graph serve no purpose—if your audience must know the actual numbers, give them a table along with the graph. A good graph uses no more ink than is needed to present the data clearly. In statistical graphics, decoration is always a distraction from the data, and sometimes an actual distortion of the data.

Figure 10.11 Chart junk: This graph is so cluttered with unnecessary ink that it is hard to see the data, Example 9.

The graph plots the percent of women of the age group of 25 and over, who have a bachelor’s degree, recorded through the years 1960 to 1998. Data in the graph are as follows.

The line starts at 5.8 percent in 1960 and steeply climbs to 22.4 percent in 1997 after passing through 8. 1 percent in 1970, 12.8 percent in 1980 and 18.4 percent in 1990.

Example 10

High taxes, reconsidered

Figure 10.4 is a respectable bar graph comparing taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product in eight countries. The countries are arranged alphabetically. Wouldn’t it be clearer to arrange them in order of their tax burdens? Figure 10.12 does this. This simple change improves the graph by making it clearer where each country stands in the group of eight countries. Figure 10.12 also demonstrates the ability to display a bar graph horizontally.

Figure 10.12 Total tax revenue as a percentage of the GDP for eight countries that are part of the OECD, Example 10. Changing the order of the bars has improved the graph in Figure 10.4. (Data from https://data.oecd.org/tax/tax-revenue.htm.)

The horizontal axis is labeled Tax Revenue (percentage of GDP) with values ranging from 0 to 50 in increments of 10 years. The vertical axis is labeled Country and has eight countries listed. Data are as follows.

France, 45 percent.

Sweden, 43 percent.

Italy, 42 percent.

Germany, 37 percent.

UK, 33 percent.

Canada, 31 percent.

Switzerland, 28 percent.

USA, 25 percent.

The data given are approximate.

Chapter 10 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 10: Statistics in Summary

To see what data say, start with graphs.

The choice of graph depends on the type of data. Do you have a categorical variable, such as level of education or occupation, which puts individuals into categories? Or do you have a quantitative variable measured in meaningful numerical units?

Check data presented in a table for roundoff errors.

The distribution of a variable tells us what values it takes and how often it takes those values.

To display the distribution of a categorical variable, use a pie chart or a bar graph. Pie charts always show the parts of some whole, but bar graphs can compare any set of numbers measured in the same units. Bar graphs are better for comparisons. Bar graphs can be displayed vertically or horizontally.

To show how a quantitative variable changes over time, use a line graph that plots values of the variable (vertical scale) against time (horizontal scale). If you have values of the variable for different categories, use a separate line for each category. Look for trends and seasonal variation in a line graph, and ask whether the data have been seasonally adjusted.

Graphs can mislead the eye. Avoid pictograms that replace the bars of a bar graph by pictures whose height and width both change. Look at the scales of a line graph to see if they have been stretched or squeezed to create a particular impression. Avoid clutter that makes the data hard to see.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

In reasoning from data to a conclusion, where the data come from is important. We studied this in Chapters 1 through 9. Once we have the data, and are satisfied that they were produced appropriately, we can begin to determine what the data tell us. Tables and graphs help us do this. In this chapter, we learned some basic methods for displaying data with tables and graphs. We learned what information these graphics provide. An important type of information is the distribution of the data—the values that occur and how often they occur. The concept of the distribution of data or the distribution of a variable is a fundamental way that statisticians think about data. We will encounter it again and again in future chapters.

Data that are produced badly can mislead us. Likewise, graphs that are produced badly can mislead us. In this chapter we learned how to recognize bad graphics. Developing「graphic sense,」the habit of asking if a graphic accurately and clearly displays our data, is as important as developing「number sense,」discussed in Chapter 9.

Case Study Evaluated

Use what you have learned in this chapter to evaluate the Case Study that opened the chapter. Start by reviewing the Chapter Summary. Then answer each of the following questions in complete sentences. Be sure to communicate clearly enough for any of your classmates to understand what you are saying.

Is Figure 10.1 the best graphical representation of the top five leading causes of death across four major age categories? What are the drawbacks to the current graphical display? Discuss which graphical display would be better and why. If you have access to statistical software, create the graphical display you think is better.

In this chapter you have:

Learned some basic methods for displaying data.

Learned how to assess the quality of the graphics you see in the media.

10.13 Attitudes on same-sex marriage. Attitudes on same-sex marriage have changed over time, but they also differ according to age. Figure 10.14 shows change in the attitudes on same-sex marriage for four generational cohorts. The y axis in this figure shows the proportion in each generational cohort who favor same-sex marriage. Comment on the overall trend in change in attitude. Explain how attitude on same-sex marriage differs according to generation.

Figure 10.14 Changing attitudes on same-sex marriage by generational cohort, Exercise 10.13. Data from Pew Research Center.

The horizontal axis is labeled Year with values ranging from 2001 to 2015 in increments of 2 years. The vertical axis is labeled Proportion with its values ranging from 0.1 to 0.7. Data in the graph are as follows.

The Silent Generation group, who were born between 1928 to 1945 starts at a proportion of 0.21 in 2001, falls to 0.8 in 2003 and rises back to 0.22 in 2009. After various ups and downs, it reaches 0.35 in 2015.

The Baby Boomers group, who were born between 1946 to 1964 starts at a proportion of 0.31 in 2001, falls to 0.29 in 2004 and climbs back to .36 in 2009 after a few ups and downs. It steadily climbs to 0.45 in 2015.

The Generation X group, who were born between 1965 to 1980 starts at a proportion of 0.49 and suddenly drops to 0.4 in 2003 and reaches 0.47 in 2010 after several ups and downs. It drops back to 0.4 in 2013 and ends at 0.58 in 2015.

The Millennials group, who were born in 1981 or later, begins at a proportion of 0.51 in 2001, drops to 0.45 in 2004 and gradually climbs to 0.55 in 2008; it climbs further and reaches 0.7 in 2015.

The data given are approximate.

10.14 International students. The Institute of International Education (IIE) collects data each year about international students who attend college or university in the United States. In their 2018 Open Doors report, the IIE reported that 33.2% of international students came to the United States from China, 17.9% came from India, 5.0% came from South Korea, 4.1% came from Saudi Arabia, 2.4% came from Canada, and 1.4% came from Mexico.

10.17 Order matters. A common statistic considered by administration at universities is credit hour production. This is calculated by taking the credit hours for a course taught times the student enrollment. For example, a faculty member teaching two 3-credit courses with 50 students each would have produced credit hours. Suppose you are the chair for the Department of Statistics and you give Figure 10.16 to your dean. The dean asks you to explain why the bars decrease in height from left to right. How would you respond?

10.29 Bad habits. According to the National Household Survey on Drug Use and Health, when asked in 2016, 23.5% of those aged 18 to 25 years used cigarettes in the past month, 5.2% used smokeless tobacco, 23.2% used illicit drugs, and 38.4% engaged in binge alcohol drinking. Explain why it is not correct to display these data in a pie chart.

10.30 Accidental deaths. In 2015, there were 146,571 deaths from unintentional injury in the United States. Among these were 47,478 deaths from poisoning, 37,757 from motor vehicle accidents, 33,381 from falls, 6,914 from suffocation, and 3,602 from drowning.

Find the percentage of accidental deaths from each of these causes, rounded to the nearest percent. What percentage of accidental deaths were due to other causes?

Make a well-labeled graph of the distribution of causes of accidental deaths.

10.31 Yields of money market funds. Many people invest in money market funds. These are mutual funds that attempt to maintain a constant price of $1 per share while paying monthly interest. Table 10.3 gives the average annual interest rates (in percent) paid by all taxable money market funds from 1973 (the first full year in which such funds were available) to 2008.

Make a line graph of the interest paid by money market funds for these years.

Interest rates, like many economic variables, show cycles, clear but repeating up-and-down movements. In which years did the interest rate cycle reach temporary peaks?

A plot against time may show a consistent trend underneath cycles. When did interest rates reach their overall peak during these years? Describe the general trend downward since that year.
