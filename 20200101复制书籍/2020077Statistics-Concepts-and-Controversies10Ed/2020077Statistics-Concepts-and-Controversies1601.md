Case Study: Who’s the Greatest Basketball Player of All Time?

Sportscasters and fans alike have been debating whether LeBron James or Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. We pay for what we value, so one way to compare LeBron James and Michael Jordan is with their salaries.

Strictly speaking, Michael Jordan’s 1997–1998 salary of $33,140,000 is less than the 2018–2019 salary of $35,654,150 for LeBron James. Does this mean that LeBron James is the best? We know that a dollar in 1997 bought more than a dollar in 2018, but how much more? Maybe in terms of buying power, Michael Jordan is the best.

We all notice the high salaries paid to professional athletes. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), for example, the mean salary rose from $2,160,000 in 1997 to $7,430,431 in 2018. That’s a big jump. Not as big as it first appears, however. A dollar in 2018 did not buy as much as a dollar in 1997, so 1997 salaries cannot be directly compared with 2018 salaries. The hard fact that the dollar has steadily lost buying power over time means that we must make an adjustment whenever we compare dollar values from different years. The adjustment is easy. What is not easy is measuring the changing buying power of the dollar. The government’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the tool we need.

Index Numbers

Key Terms

An index number measures the value of a variable relative to its value at a base period. To find the index number for any value of the variable:

The CPI is one kind of numerical description, an index number. We can attach an index number to any quantitative variable that we measure repeatedly over time. The idea of the index number is to give a comparison of changes in a variable over time. For example,「The average cost of tuition and fees at public four-year colleges rose 103.7% between 1998–1999 and 2018–2019.」That is, an index number reflects the change in a variable when compared to a base period.

Example 1

Calculating an index number

A gallon of unleaded regular gasoline cost $0.997 during the first week of November 1998 and $2.670 during the first week of November 2018. (These are national average prices calculated by the U.S. Department of Energy.) The gasoline price index number for the first week in November 2018, with the first week in November 1998 as the base period, is

The gasoline price index number for the base period, November 1998, is

Knowing the base period is essential to making sense of an index number. Because the index number for the base period is always 100, it is usual to identify the base period as 1998 by writing「」In news reports concerning the CPI, you will notice the mysterious equation「」That’s shorthand for the fact that the years 1982 to 1984 are the base period for the CPI. An index number just gives the current value as a percentage of the base value. Index number 271.1 means 271.1% of the base value, or a 171.1% increase from the base value. Index number 57 means that the current value is 57% of the base, a 43% decrease.

Fixed Market Basket Price Indexes

It may seem that index numbers are little more than a plot to disguise simple statements in complex language. Why say,「The Consumer Price Index stood at 252.9 in October 2018,」instead of「Consumer prices rose 152.9% between the 1982–84 average and October 2018」? In fact, the term「index number」usually means more than a measure of change relative to a base. It also tells us the kind of variable whose change we measure. That variable is a weighted average of several quantities, with fixed weights. Let’s illustrate the idea by a simple price index.

Example 2

The mountain man price index

Andrew Johnson lives in a cabin in the mountains and strives for self-sufficiency. He buys only salt, kerosene, and the services of a professional welder. Here are Andrew’s purchases in 2000, the base period. His cost, in the last column, is the price per unit multiplied by the number of units he purchased.

Good or service 2000 quantity 2000 price 2000 cost

Salt 100 pounds $0.55/pound $55.00

Kerosene 50 gallons 0.979/gallon 48.95

Welding 10 hours 13.75/hour 137.50

Total cost = $241.45

The total cost of Andrew’s collection of goods and services in 2000 was $241.45. To find the「Mountain Man Price Index」for 2018, we use 2018 prices to calculate the 2018 cost of this same collection of goods and services. Here is the calculation:

Good or service 2000 quantity 2018 price 2018 cost

Salt 100 pounds $0.675/pound $67.50

Kerosene 50 gallons 2.209/gallon 110.45

Welding 10 hours 22.34/hour 223.40

Total cost = $401.35

The same goods and services that cost $241.45 in 2000 cost $401.35 in 2018. So the Mountain Man Price Index for 2018 is

Key Terms

A fixed market basket price index is an index number for the total cost of a fixed collection of goods and services.

The point of Example 2 is that we follow the cost of the same collection of goods and services over time. It may be that Andrew refused to hire the welder in 2018 because he could not afford him. No matter—the index number uses the 2000 quantities, ignoring any changes in Andrew’s purchases between 2000 and 2018. We call the collection of goods and services whose total cost we follow a market basket. The index number is then a fixed market basket price index.

The basic idea of a fixed market basket price index is that the weight given to each component (salt, kerosene, welding) remains fixed over time. The CPI is in essence a fixed market basket price index, with several hundred items that represent all consumer purchases. Holding the market basket fixed allows a legitimate comparison of prices because we compare the prices of exactly the same items at each time. As we will see, it also poses severe problems for the CPI.

Using the CPI

For now, think of the CPI as an index number for the cost of everything that American consumers buy. That the CPI for October 2018 was 252.9 means that we must spend $252.9 in October 2018 to buy goods and services that cost $100 in the 1982 to 1984 base period. An index number for「the cost of everything」lets us compare dollar amounts from different years by converting all the amounts into dollars of the same year. You will find tables in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, for example, with headings such as「Median Household Income (in 2017 dollars).」That table has restated all incomes in dollars that will buy as much as the dollar would buy in 2017. Watch for the term constant dollars and for phrases like real income or real terms. They mean that all dollar amounts represent the same buying power even though they may describe different years.

Table 16.1 gives the annual CPI for the years from 1915 to 2018. Figure 16.1 is a line graph of the annual percentage increase in CPI values. It shows that the periods from 1915 to 1920, the 1940s, and from 1975 to 1985 experienced high inflation. Although there is considerable variation, the annual percentage increase is positive in most years. In general, the twentieth century was a time of steep inflation. The twenty-first century has inflation too, but it is less extreme than the previous century. Faced with the depressing fact of inflation, it would be foolish to think about dollars without adjusting for their decline in buying power. Here is the recipe for converting dollars of one year into dollars of another year.

The years 1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, 2000, and 2020 are represented along the horizontal axis. The increase in C P I is represented along the vertical axis and its values range from negative 5 to 30. The curve originates at (1920, 10), passes through points (1940, 1), (1930, negative 2), (1960, 4), (1978, 27), (1980, 9), (2000, 4), and (2009, negative 1), and ends at (2020, 5).

Adjusting for changes in buying power

To convert an amount in dollars at time A to the amount with the same buying power at time B:

Notice that the CPI for the time you are going to appears on the top in the ratio of CPIs in this formula. Here are some examples.

Example 3

Salaries of professional athletes

The mean salary of NBA players rose from $2,160,000 in 1997 to $7,430,431 in 2018. How big was the increase in real terms? Let’s convert the 1997 average into October 2018 dollars. Table 16.1 gives the annual average CPI for 1997, and previously we mentioned that the CPI was $252.9 in October 2018.

That is, it took $3,403,514 in October 2018 to buy what $2,160,000 would buy in 1997. We can now compare the 1997 mean salary of $3,403,514 in October 2018 dollars with the actual 2018 mean salary, $7,430,431. Today’s athletes earn much more than 1997 athletes even after adjusting for the fact that the dollar buys less now. (Of course, the mean salary is pulled up by the very high salaries paid to a few star players. The 1997 median salary was $1,402,000 and the 2018 median salary was $3,627,842.)

Now it’s your turn

16.1 Basketball salaries. Refer to Example 3. Convert the 1997 median basketball salary into 2018 dollars. How do the values compare?

Example 4

Rising incomes?

For a more serious example, let’s leave the pampered world of professional athletes and look at the incomes of ordinary people. The median annual income of all American households was $22,415 in 1984. By 2017 (the most recent year for which data were available at the time of this writing) the median income had risen to $61,372. Dollar income more than doubled, but we know that much of that rise is an illusion because of the dollar’s declining buying power. To compare these incomes, we must express them in dollars of the same year. Let’s express the 1984 median household income in 2017 dollars:

Real household incomes rose from $52,876 to $61,372 in the 33 years between 1984 and 2017. That’s a 16.1% increase.

The picture is different at the top. The 5% of households with the highest incomes earned $68,500 or more in 1984. In 2017 dollars, this is

In fact, the top 5% of households earned $237,034 or more in 2017. That is, the real income of the highest earners increased by 46.7%.

Finally, let’s look at the bottom. The 20% of households with the lowest incomes earned $9,500 or less in 1984. In 2017 dollars, this is

In fact, the bottom 20% of households earned $24,638 or less in 2017. That is, the real income of the lowest earners increased by only 9.9%.

Now it’s your turn

16.2 Production workers. Let’s look at hourly paid workers in the United States. Their median annual earnings were $24,856 in 2007 and $30,430 in 2017. Compute the 2007 earnings in 2017 dollars. By what percentage did the real earnings of hourly paid workers change between 2007 and 2017?

Statistics in Your World

So you think that’s inflation? Americans were unhappy when oil price increases in 1973 set off a round of inflation that saw the Consumer Price Index almost double in the following decade. That’s nothing—in Argentina, prices rose 127% in a single month, July 1989. The Turkish lira went from 14 to the dollar in 1970 to 579,000 to the dollar in 2000. The Zimbabwe dollar went from 253 to the dollar in September 2007 to 60,623 to the dollar by December 2008. There were 65 German marks to a dollar in January 1920, and 4,200,000,000,000 marks to a dollar in November 1923. Now that’s inflation.

Example 4 illustrates how using the CPI to compare dollar amounts from different years brings out truths that are otherwise hidden. In this case, the truth is that the fruits of prosperity since the 1980s went mostly to those at the top of the income distribution and that very little real progress was made by those at the bottom. Put another way, people with the highest pay (usually those with skills and education) did much better than people with the lowest pay (usually those who lack special skills and college educations). Economists suggest several reasons: the「new economy」that rewards knowledge, high immigration leading to competition for less-skilled jobs, more competition from abroad, and so on. Exactly why incomes at the top have increased so much and what we should do about the stagnant incomes of those at the bottom are controversial questions.

Understanding the CPI

The idea of the CPI is that it is an index number for the cost of everything American consumers buy. That idea needs lots of adjusting to be practical. Much of the fiddling uses the results of large sample surveys.

Who is covered? The official name for the common version of the CPI (there are others, but we will ignore them) is the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The CPI market basket represents the purchases of people living or working in urban areas. The official definition of「urban」is broad, so that about 80% of the U.S. population is covered. But if you live on a farm, the CPI doesn’t apply to you.

How is the market basket chosen? Different households buy different things, so how can we get a single market basket? From a sample survey—the Consumer Expenditure Survey gathers detailed data on the spending of more than 30,000 households. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) breaks spending into categories such as「fresh fruits and vegetables,」「new and used motor vehicles,」and「hospital and related services.」Then it chooses specific items, such as「fresh oranges,」to represent each group in the market basket. The items in the market basket get weights that represent their category’s proportion of all spending. The weights, and even the specific market basket items, are updated regularly to keep up with changing buying habits. So the market basket isn’t actually fixed.

How are the prices determined? From more sample surveys. The BLS must discover the price of「fresh oranges」every month. That price differs from city to city and from store to store in the same city. Each month, the BLS records 80,000 prices in 87 cities at a sample of stores. The Point of Purchase Survey of 16,800 households keeps the BLS up-to-date on where consumers shop for each category of goods and services (supermarkets, convenience stores, discount stores, and so on).

Does the CPI measure changes in the cost of living? A fixed market basket price index measures the cost of living the same over time, as Example 2 illustrated. In fact, we don’t keep buying the same market basket of goods and services over time. We switch from LP records to cassette tapes and CDs and then to digital music downloads. We don’t buy new 1998 cars in 2008 or 2018. As prices change, we may change what we buy. For example, if beef becomes expensive, we may buy less beef and more chicken or more tofu. A fixed market basket price index can’t accurately measure changes in the cost of living when the economy itself is changing.

The BLS tries hard to keep its market basket up-to-date and to compensate for changes in quality. Every year, for example, the BLS must decide how much of the increase in new-car prices is paying for better quality. Only what’s left counts as a genuine price increase in calculating the CPI. Between December 1967 and December 1994, actual car prices went up 313.4%, but the new-car price in the CPI went up only 172.1%. In 1995, adjustments for better quality reduced the overall rise in the prices of goods and services from 4.7% to only 2.2%. Prices of goods and services make up about 70% of the CPI. Most of the rest is the cost of shelter—renting an apartment or buying a house. House prices are another problem for the BLS. People buy houses partly to live in and partly because they think owning a house is a good investment. If we pay more for a house because we think it’s a good investment, the full price should not go into the CPI.

By now it is clear that the CPI is not a fixed market basket price index, though that is the best way to start thinking about it. The BLS must constantly change the market basket as new products appear and our buying habits change. It must adjust the prices its sample surveys record to take account of better quality and the investment component of house prices. Yet the CPI still does not measure all changes in our cost of living. It leaves out taxes, for example, which are certainly part of our cost of living.

Even if we agree that the CPI should look only at the goods and services we buy, it doesn’t perfectly measure changes in our cost of living. In principle, a true「cost-of-living index」would measure the cost of the same standard of living over time. That’s why we start with a fixed market basket price index, which also measures the cost of living the same over time but takes the simple view that「the same」means buying exactly the same things. If we are just as satisfied after switching from beef to tofu to avoid paying more for beef, our standard of living hasn’t changed and a cost-of-living index should ignore the higher price of beef. If we are willing to pay more for products that keep our environment clean, we are paying for a higher standard of living and the index should treat this just like an improvement in the quality of a new car. The BLS says that it would like the CPI to track changes in the cost of living, but that a true cost-of-living index isn’t possible in the real world.

STATISTICAL CONTROVERSIES

Does the CPI Overstate Inflation?

In 1995, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan estimated that the CPI overstates inflation by somewhere between 0.5% and 1.5% per year. Mr. Greenspan was unhappy about this because increases in the CPI automatically drive up federal spending. At the end of 1996, a group of outside experts appointed by the Senate Finance Committee estimated that the CPI had in the past overstated the rate of inflation by about 1.1% per year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) agreed that the CPI overstates inflation but thought that the experts’ guess of 1.1% per year was too high.

The reasons the CPI shows the value of a dollar falling faster than is true are due partly to the nature of the CPI and partly to limits on how quickly the BLS can adjust the details of the enormous machine that lies behind the CPI. Think first about the details. The prices of new products, such as digital cameras and flat-screen televisions, often start high and drop rapidly. The CPI market basket changes too slowly to capture the drop in price. Discount stores with lower prices also enter the CPI sample slowly. Although the BLS tries hard to adjust for better product quality, the outside experts thought these adjustments were often too little and too late. The BLS has made many improvements in these details (most recently, in February 2015). The improved CPI would have grown about 0.5% per year more slowly than the actual CPI between 1978 and 1998.

The wider issue is the nature of the CPI as essentially a fixed market basket index. What sort of bias does such an index create? Does it produce an upward bias—that is, does it overstate the cost of living? Or does it create a downward bias—that is, does it understate the cost of living? Why?

The Place of Government Statistics

Modern nations run on statistics. Economic data, in particular, guide government policy and inform the decisions of private business and individuals. Price indexes and unemployment rates, along with many other, less-publicized series of data, are produced by government statistical offices.

Some countries have a single statistical office, such as Statistics Canada (www.statcan.ca), the Australian Bureau of Statistics (www.abs.gov.au), and Statistics Sweden (www.scb.se/en). Others attach smaller offices to various branches of government. The United States is an extreme case: there are 13 principal statistical agencies with another 89 federal statistical offices. The U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics are the largest, but you may at times use the products of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the National Center for Health Statistics, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or others in the federal government’s collection of statistical agencies.

A 1993 ranking of government statistical agencies by the heads of these agencies in several nations put Canada at the top, with the United States tied with Britain and Germany for sixth place. The top spots generally went to countries with a single, independent statistical office. In 1996, Britain combined its main statistical agencies to form a new Office for National Statistics (www.gov.uk/government/statistics). U.S. government statistical agencies remain fragmented.

What do citizens need from their government statistical agencies? First of all, they need data that are accurate and timely and that keep up with changes in society and the economy. Producing accurate data quickly demands considerable resources. Think of the large-scale sample surveys that produce the unemployment rate and the CPI. The major U.S. statistical offices have a good reputation for accuracy and lead the world in getting data to the public quickly. Their record for keeping up with changes is less impressive. The struggle to adjust the CPI for changing buying habits and changing quality is one issue. Another is the failure of U.S. economic statistics to keep up with trends such as the shift from manufacturing to health care and technology as the major types of economic activity.

Much of the difficulty stems from lack of money. In the years after 1980, reducing federal spending was a political priority. Government statistical agencies lost staff and cut programs. Lower salaries made it hard to attract the best economists and statisticians to government. The level of government spending on data also depends on our view of what data the government should produce. In particular, should the government produce data that are used mainly by private business rather than by the government’s own policymakers? Perhaps such data should be either compiled by private concerns or produced only for those who are willing to pay. This is a question of political philosophy rather than statistics, but it helps determine what level of government statistics we want to pay for.

Freedom from political influence is as important to government statistics as accuracy and timeliness. When a statistical office is part of a government ministry, it can be influenced by the needs and desires of that ministry. The U.S. Census Bureau is in the Department of Commerce, which serves business interests. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is in the Department of Labor. Thus, business and labor each have「their own」statistical office. The professionals in the statistical offices successfully resist direct political interference—a poor unemployment report is never delayed until after an election, for example. But indirect influence is clearly present. The BLS must compete with other Department of Labor activities for its budget, for example. Political interference with statistical work seems to be increasing, as when Congress refused to allow the U.S. Census Bureau to use sample surveys to correct for undercounting in the 2000 census. Such corrections may convince statisticians but do not necessarily convince the general public. Congress, not without justification, considers the public legitimacy of the census to be as important as its technical perfection. Thus, from Congress’s point of view, political interference was justified even though the decision was disappointing to statisticians.

The 1996 reorganization of Britain’s statistical offices was prompted in part by a widespread feeling that political influence was too strong. The details of how unemployment is measured in Britain were changed many times in the 1980s, for example, and almost all the changes had the effect of reducing the reported unemployment rate—just what the government wanted to see.

The Question of Social Statistics

National economic statistics are well established with the government, the media, and the public. The government also produces a lot of data on social issues such as education, health, housing, and crime. Social statistics are less complete than economic statistics. We have good data about how much money is spent on food but less information about how many people are poorly nourished. Social data are also less carefully produced than economic data. Economic statistics are generally based on larger samples, are compiled more often, and are published with a shorter time lag. The reason is clear: economic data are used by the government to guide economic policy month by month. Social data help us understand our society and address its problems but are not needed for short-term management.

There are other reasons the government is reluctant to produce social data. Many people don’t want the government to ask about their sexual behavior or religion. Many people feel that the government should avoid asking about our opinions—apparently it’s OK to ask,「When did you last visit a doctor?」but not「How satisfied are you with the quality of your health care?」These hesitations reflect the American suspicion of government intrusion. Yet issues such as sexual behaviors that contribute to the spread of HIV and satisfaction with health care are clearly important to citizens. Both facts and opinions on these issues can sway elections and influence policy. How can we get accurate information about social issues, collected consistently over time, and yet not entangle the government with sex, religion, and other touchy subjects?

The solution in the United States has been government funding of university sample surveys. After first deciding to undertake a sample survey asking people about their sexual behavior, in part to guide AIDS policy, the government backed away. Instead, it funded a much smaller survey of 3452 adults by the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center (NORC). NORC’s General Social Survey (GSS), funded by the government’s National Science Foundation, belongs with the Current Population Survey and the samples that undergird the CPI on any list of the most important sample surveys in the United States. The GSS includes both「fact」and「opinion」items. Respondents answer questions about their job security, their job satisfaction, and their satisfaction with their city, their friends, and their families. They talk about race, religion, and sex. Many Americans would object if the government asked whether they had seen an X-rated movie in the past year, but they reply when the GSS asks this question. The website for the GSS is www.norc.org/GSS+Website//.

This indirect system of government funding of a university-based sample survey fits the American feeling that the government itself should not be unduly invasive. It also insulates the survey from most political pressure. Alas, the government’s budget cutting extends to the GSS, which now describes itself as an「almost annual」survey because lack of funds has prevented taking samples in some years. The GSS is, we think, a bargain.

This might be a good place to read the「What’s the verdict?」story on page 390, and to answer the questions. These questions ask you to consider the issue of how much control government should exercise over what research can and cannot be funded by government agencies.

Chapter 16 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 16: Statistics in Summary

An index number describes the value of a variable relative to its value at some base period.

A fixed market basket price index is an index number that describes the total cost of a collection of goods and services.

Think of the government’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a fixed market basket price index for the collection of all the goods and services that consumers buy.

Because the CPI shows how consumer prices change over time, we can use it to change a dollar amount at one time into the amount at another time that has the same buying power. This is needed to compare dollar values from different times in real terms.

The details of the CPI are complex. It uses data from several large sample surveys. It is not a true fixed market basket price index because of adjustments for changing buying habits, new products, and improved quality.

Government statistical offices produce data needed for government policy and decisions by businesses and individuals. The data should be accurate, timely, and free from political interference. Citizens therefore have a stake in the competence and independence of government statistical offices.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

In Chapters 10 to 15, we studied methods for summarizing large amounts of data to help us see what the data are telling us. In this chapter, we discussed numbers that summarize large amounts of data on consumers to help us see what these data are telling us about the costs of goods and services. Because these index numbers, in particular the CPI, are used by the government and media to describe the cost of living, understanding how they are computed and what they represent will help us be better informed citizens.

Case Study Evaluated

Use what you have learned in this chapter to evaluate the Case Study that opened the chapter. Start by reviewing the Chapter Summary. Then answer each of the following questions in complete sentences. Be sure to communicate clearly enough for any of your classmates to understand what you are saying.

The average CPI for 1997 and 2018 can be found in Table 16.1. Use what you have learned in this chapter to convert Michael Jordan’s 1997 salary, given in the Case Study at the beginning of this chapter, to 2018 dollars. Who had the largest salary in terms of 2018 dollars: Michael Jordan or LeBron James? Does this convince you which basketball player is the greatest of all time?

must be larger than 100.

all of the above.

16.6 The Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI

can be thought of as a fixed market basket price index for the collection of all the goods and services that consumers buy. However, it is not a true fixed market basket price index because of adjustments for changing buying habits, new products, and improved quality.

Chapter 16 Exercises

When you need the CPI for a year that does not appear in Table 16.1, use the table entry for the year that most closely follows the year you want.

16.8 The price of gasoline. The yearly average price of unleaded regular gasoline has fluctuated as follows:

1998: $1.09 per gallon

2008: $3.09 per gallon

2018: $2.44 per gallon

Give the gasoline price index numbers for 1998, 2008, and 2018. Relatively speaking, which year had the highest gas price?

16.9 The cost of college. The part of the CPI that measures the cost of college tuition was 748.4 in October 2018. The overall CPI was 252.9 that month.

Explain exactly what the index number 748.4 tells us about the rise in college tuition between the base period and October 2018.

College tuition has risen much faster than consumer prices in general. How do you know this?

16.10 The price of gasoline. Use your results from Exercise 16.8 to answer these questions.

By how many points did the gasoline price index number change between 1998 and 2018? What percentage change was this?

By how many points did the gasoline price index number change between 2008 and 2018? What percentage change was this?

You see that the point change and the percentage change in an index number are the same if we start in the base period, but not otherwise.

16.11 Toxic releases. The Environmental Protection Agency requires industry to report releases of any of a list of toxic chemicals. The total amounts released (in thousands of pounds, total on- and off-site disposal or other releases, all chemicals, all industries) were 6,939,299 in 1988, 6,655,831 in 2000, and 4,137,328 in 2013. Give an index number for toxic chemical releases in each of these years, with 1988 as the base period. By what percentage did releases increase or decrease between 1988 and 2000? Between 1988 and 2013?

16.12 How much can a dollar buy? The buying power of a dollar changes over time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the cost of a「market basket」of goods and services to compile its Consumer Price Index (CPI). If the CPI is 120, goods and services that cost $100 in the base period now cost $120. Here are the average values of the CPI for the years between 1970 and 2018. The base period is the years 1982 to 1984.

Year CPI Year CPI Year CPI

1970 38.8 1990 130.7 2010 218.1

1972 41.8 1992 140.3 2011 224.9

1974 49.3 1994 148.2 2012 229.6

1976 56.9 1996 156.9 2013 233.0

1978 65.2 1998 163.0 2014 236.7

1980 82.4 2000 172.2 2016 240.0

1982 96.5 2002 179.9 2018 251.0

1984 103.9 2004 188.9

1986 109.6 2006 201.6

1988 118.3 2008 215.3

Make a graph that shows how the CPI has changed over time.

What was the overall trend in prices during this period? Were there any years in which this trend was reversed?

In which years were prices rising fastest, in terms of percentage increase? In what period were they rising slowest?

16.13 Los Angeles and New York. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes separate consumer price indexes for major metropolitan areas in addition to the national CPI. The CPI in October 2018 was 269.5 in Los Angeles and 275.1 in New York.

These numbers tell us that prices rose faster in New York than in Los Angeles between the base period and October 2018. Explain how we know this.

These numbers do not tell us that prices in October 2018 were higher in New York than in Los Angeles. Explain why.

16.14 The Food Faddist Price Index. A food faddist eats only steak, rice, and ice cream. In 1998, he bought:

Item 1998 quantity 1998 price

Steak 200 pounds $4.15/pound

Rice 300 pounds 0.55/pound

Ice cream 50 gallons 6.08/gallon

After a visit from his mother, he adds oranges to his diet. Oranges cost $0.53/pound in 1998. Here are the food faddist’s food purchases in 2018:

Item 2018 quantity 2018 price

Steak 100 pounds $8.21/pound

Rice 350 pounds 0.68/pound

Ice cream 75 gallons 9.57/gallon

Oranges 100 pounds 1.33/pound

Find the fixed market basket Food Faddist Price Index for the year 2018.

16.15 The Guru Price Index. A guru purchases only olive oil, loincloths, and copies of the Atharva Veda, from which he selects mantras for his disciples. Here are the quantities and prices of his purchases in 1985 and 2015:

Item 1985 quantity 1985 price 2015 quantity 2015 price

Olive oil 20 pints $2.50/pint 18 pints $7.50/pint

Loincloth 2 2.75 each 3 4.00 each

Atharva Veda 1 10.95 1 18.95

From these data, find the fixed market basket Guru Price Index for 2015.

16.16 The curse of the Bambino. In 1920 the Boston Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees for $125,000. Between 1920 and 2004, the Yankees won 26 World Series and the Red Sox won 1 (and that occurred in 2004). The Red Sox victory in 2004 supposedly broke the curse. In fact, the Red Sox won the World Series again in 2007, 2013, and 2018.

How much is Ruth’s 1920 salary of $125,000 worth in 2004 dollars?

How much is Ruth’s 1920 salary of $125,000 worth in 2018 dollars?

16.17 The cost of reading. A 2002 Salon article attempted to tackle the question「Why do books cost so much?」The article posited that the move from mass-market paperback to the larger and higher quality trade paperback may have contributed to increasing costs of books. Salon used John Updike’s Rabbit, Run as an example. A mass-market paperback cost only 65 cents in the 1960s, but a 1991 mass-market paperback cost $5.99. In 2002, Rabbit, Run was only available in trade paperback and cost $14. In 2018 the same trade paperback cost $17. With discounts from online venues, a reader could purchase the 2002 trade paperback for $11.20 and can currently purchase the 2018 trade paperback for $14.50. Compare the discounted prices from 2002 and 2018. Relatively speaking, which was a better deal for the trade paperback of Rabbit, Run?

16.18 Blockbuster movies. According to Box Office Mojo, Star Wars: Episode VII–The Force Awakens, released in 2015, is the highest domestic grossing movie with sales amounting to $936,662,225. Gone with the Wind, released in 1939, grossed a mere $198,676,459. Due to inflation, it seems unfair to judge the two movies in original dollar amounts. Convert both movies’ gross earnings to 2018 dollars and determine which movie earned more, relatively speaking.

16.19 Dream on. When Sonia started college in 2014, she set a goal of making $50,000 when she graduated. Sonia graduated in 2018. What must Sonia earn in 2018 in order to have the same buying power that $50,000 had in 2014?

16.20 Living too long? If both husband and wife are alive at age 65, in half the cases at least one will still be alive at age 93, 28 years later. Tom and Phyllis retired in 1990 with an income of $35,000 per year. They were quite comfortable—that was about the median family income in 1990. How much income did they need 28 years later, in 2018, to have the same buying power?

16.21 Microwaves on sale. The prices of new gadgets often start high and then fall rapidly. The first home microwave oven cost $1300 in 1955. You can now buy a better microwave oven for $100. Find the latest value of the CPI (it’s on the website, www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm) and use it to restate $100 in present-day dollars in 1955 dollars. Compare this with $1300 to see how much microwave oven real prices have come down.

16.22 Good golfers. In 2017, Justin Thomas won $9,921,560 on the Professional Golfers Association tour. The leading money winner in 1946 was Ben Hogan, at $42,566. Arnold Palmer, the leader in 1963, won $128,230, and Jack Nicklaus, the leader in 1972, won $320,542 that year. How do these amounts compare in real terms?

16.23 Joe DiMaggio. Yankee center fielder Joe DiMaggio was paid $32,000 in 1940 and $100,000 in 1950. Express his 1940 salary in 1950 dollars. By what percentage did DiMaggio’s real income change in the decade?

16.24 New car prices. In 1980, a new Honda Accord Sedan cost $6515. The same car model and trim cost $22,750 in 1998 and $31,970 in 2018. Compare the real costs of these cars By what percentage did the real cost change between 1980 and 1998? Between 1980 and October 2018? Between 1998 and October 2018? The CPI in October 2018 was 252.9.

16.25 Paying for college. Todd thought tuition was expensive when his tuition at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) was $10,500 in 1986. Now Todd is planning to send his daughter to college. The tuition at WashU was $48,859 in 2018. Express WashU’s 1986 tuition in 2018 dollars. Did the cost of going to WashU go up faster or slower than consumer prices in general? How do you know?

16.26 Paying for college. Nineveh is looking at colleges and knows that in-state tuition at UCLA will cost her $13,749 in 2018. During her search, Nineveh stumbles across a brochure that lists the in-state tuition at UCLA as $3863 in 1998 and as $7551 in 2008. She wonders which of the three years had the highest tuition, relatively speaking, and calculates all tuitions in 2018 dollars. Perform the same calculations that Nineveh did and state which tuition year was the highest, relatively speaking.

16.27 Paying for college. Arjun is considering going to college at University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA. The tuition is $46,346 in 2018, and the cost of room and board is $13,356 that same year. Arjun’s family started saving money for college in 2008, when tuition at University of the Pacific was $30,880 and the cost of room and board was $10,118. Which of the two costs, tuition or room and board, increased more between 2008 and 2018? How do you know?

16.28 The minimum wage. The federal government sets the minimum hourly wage that employers can pay a worker. Labor wants a high minimum wage, but many economists argue that too high a minimum wage makes employers reluctant to hire workers with low skills and it therefore increases unemployment. Here is information on changes in the federal minimum wage, in dollars per hour:

Year: 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985

Min. wage ($): 1.00 1.25 1.60 2.10 3.10 3.35

Year: 1990 1995 2005 2007 2008 2009

Min. wage ($): 3.80 4.25 5.15 5.85 6.55 7.25

Use annual average CPIs from Table 16.1 to restate the minimum wage in constant 1960 dollars. Make two line graphs on the same axes, one showing the actual minimum wage during these years and the other showing the minimum wage in constant dollars. Explain carefully to someone who knows no statistics what your graphs show about the history of the minimum wage.

16.29 College tuition. Tuition for Michigan residents at the University of Michigan has increased as follows (use tuition at your own college if you have those data):

Year: 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008

Tuition ($): 6098 6513 7411 8202 9723 11,037

Year: 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018

Tuition ($): 11,837 12,994 13,486 14,402 15,262

Use annual average CPIs from Table 16.1 to restate each year’s tuition in constant 1998 dollars. Make two line graphs on the same axes, one showing actual dollar tuition for these years and the other showing constant dollar tuition. Then explain to someone who knows no statistics what your graphs show.

16.30 Rising incomes? In Example 4, we saw that the median real income (in 2017 dollars) of all households rose from $52,876 in 1984 to $61,372 in 2017. The real income that marks off the top 5% of households rose from $161,591 to $237,034 in the same period. Verify the claim in Example 4 that median income rose 16.1% and that the real income of top earners rose 46.7%.

16.31 Cable TV. Suppose that cable television systems across the country add channels to their lineup and raise the monthly fee they charge subscribers. The part of the CPI that tracks cable TV prices might not go up at all, even though consumers must pay more. Explain why.

16.32 Item weights in the CPI. The cost of buying a house (with the investment component removed) makes up about 24% of the CPI. The cost of renting a place to live makes up about 6%. Where do the weights 24% and 6% come from? Why does the cost of buying get more weight in the index?

16.33 The CPI doesn’t fit me. The CPI may not measure your personal experience with changing prices. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI reflects the spending patterns of all urban consumers and urban wage earners and clerical workers. Those who live in rural nonmetropolitan areas or in farm households, those who are in the military, and those living in institutions (e.g., prisons, residential psychiatric facilities) are not reflected in the CPI. Explain why the CPI will not fit each of these people:

Aisha lives on a cattle ranch in Montana.

Mohammed heats his home with a wood stove and does not have air-conditioning.

Luis and Maria were in a serious auto accident and spent much of last year in a rehabilitation center.

Gabriel was homeless and unemployed last year.

Aliyah is in the U.S. Marine Corps and lived on base at Okinawa, Japan.

16.34 Seasonal adjustment. Like many government data series, the CPI is published in both unadjusted and seasonally adjusted forms. The BLS says that it「strongly recommends using indexes unadjusted for seasonal variation (i.e., not seasonally adjusted indexes) for escalation.」「Escalation」here means adjusting wage or other payments to keep up with changes in the CPI. Why is the unadjusted CPI preferred for this purpose?

16.35 More CPIs. In addition to the national CPI, the BLS publishes CPIs for 4 regions and for 37 local areas. Each regional and local CPI is based on just the part of the national sample of prices that applies to the region or local area. The BLS says that the local CPIs should be used with caution because they are much more variable than national or regional CPIs. Why is this?

16.36 The poverty line. The federal government announces「poverty lines」each year for households of different sizes. Households with income below the announced levels are considered to be living in poverty. An economist looked at the poverty lines over time and said that they「show a pattern of getting higher in real terms as the real income of the general population rises.」What does「getting higher in real terms」say about the official poverty level?

16.37 Real wages (optional). In one of the many reports on stagnant incomes in the United States, we read that in the 1980s all income groups realized a decline in real wages. The decline was not the same for all income groups. Workers at the 33rd percentile saw a 14% decrease in real wage, while those at the 66th percentile saw just a 6% decrease. And those who earned wages at the highest rates actually saw a 1% increase in real wages.

What is meant by「the 33rd percentile」of the income distribution?

What does「real wages」mean?

16.38 Saving money? One way to cut the cost of government statistics is to reduce the sizes of the samples. We might, for example, cut the Current Population Survey from 50,000 households to 20,000. Explain clearly, to someone who knows no statistics, why such cuts reduce the accuracy of the resulting data.

16.39 The General Social Survey. The General Social Survey places much emphasis on asking many of the same questions year after year. Why do you think it does this?

16.40 Measuring the effects of crime. We wish to include, as part of a set of social statistics, measures of the amount of crime and of the impact of crime on people’s attitudes and activities. Suggest some possible measures in each of the following categories:

Statistics to be compiled from official sources such as police records.

Factual information to be collected using a sample survey of citizens.

Information on opinions and attitudes to be collected using a sample survey.

16.41 Statistical agencies. Write a short description of the work of one of these government statistical agencies. You can find information by starting at the FedStats website (www.fedstats.gov) and going to Agencies.

Bureau of Economic Analysis (Department of Commerce)

What’s the Verdict?

The following「What’s the verdict?」story asks you to think about what research should and should not be funded by the government. Although answers may not be clear-cut, you will use what you have learned in this chapter to help you think about this issue.

In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the Dickey Amendment, which was lobbied for by the National Rifle Association and stated that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not use any federal funding for injury prevention to advocate for gun control. This amendment basically prevented the CDC from performing research on gun violence, treatment, and prevention so that the CDC would not lose important funding. In 2011, the restrictions were also extended to other agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. As a result, the United States is not as well equipped as it could be to deal with mass shootings. For example, hospital officials from Aurora, Colorado (the location of the Batman movie theater shooting), and Boston, Massachusetts (the Boston Marathon bombing), could share their stories anecdotally, but very little scientific study has been done on the best methods to transport, triage, and treat gun violence victims in mass casualty events. Public health officials, emergency services workers, and medical practitioners cannot adequately prepare for these devastating situations without high-quality studies on best practices in prevention and treatment. President Obama signed an Executive Order after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newton, Connecticut, to allow some gun violence research by the CDC, but not very much has happened since then because little funding was given to the CDC for this research. In 2018, the amendment still exists, but much of its power is reduced due to newer legislation.

Questions

WTV16.1. What do you think about the power government has to decide which research can and cannot be done?

WTV16.2. Can you think of any research topics that you do not think would be acceptable to receive government funding?

WTV16.3. Can you think of other examples of how the government can regulate what data are collected or how they are analyzed?

What’s the verdict? Government policies concerning research can be controversial, and people will disagree about what should be regulated and how much control the government should exercise.

PART II Review

Data analysis is the art of describing data using graphs and numerical summaries. The purpose of data analysis is to help us see and understand the most important features of a set of data. Chapter 10 commented on basic graphs, especially pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 showed how data analysis works by presenting statistical ideas and tools for describing the distribution of one variable. Figure II.1 organizes the big ideas. We plot our data, then describe their center and spread using either the mean and standard deviation or the five-number summary. The last step, which makes sense only for some data, is to summarize the data in compact form by using a Normal curve as a model for the overall pattern. The question marks at the last two stages remind us that the usefulness of numerical summaries and Normal distributions depends on what we find when we examine graphs of our data. No short summary does justice to irregular shapes or to data with several distinct clusters.

Figure II.1

The flow diagram begins with a text that reads, Plot your data Stemplot, Histogram. This leads to Interpret what you see Shape, Center, Spread, Outliers and then branches to Numerical summary? x bar and s, Five-Number Summary? It finally leads to the text that reads, Compact model? Normal Distribution?

Chapters 14 and 15 applied the same ideas to relationships between two quantitative variables. Figure II.2 retraces the big ideas from Figure II.1, with details that fit the new setting. We always begin by making graphs of our data. In the case of a scatterplot, we have learned a numerical summary only for data that show a roughly straight-line pattern on the scatterplot. The summary is then the means and standard deviations of the two variables and their correlation. A regression line drawn on the plot gives us a compact model of the overall pattern that we can use for prediction. Once again, there are question marks at the last two stages to remind us that correlation and regression describe only straight-line relationships.

Figure II.2

The flow diagram begins with text that reads, Plot your data Scatterplot, which leads to Interpret what you see Direction, Form, Strength, Outliers. It further leads to Numerical summary? x bar, y bar, s subscript x, s subscript y, and r? It finally leads to the text that reads, Compact model? Regression line?

Relationships often raise the question of causation. We know that evidence from randomized comparative experiments is the「gold standard」for deciding that one variable causes changes in another variable. Chapter 15 reminded us in more detail that strong associations can appear in data even when there is no direct causation. We must always think about the possible effects of variables lurking in the background. In Chapter 16, we met a new kind of description, index numbers, with the Consumer Price Index as the leading example. Chapter 16 also discussed government statistical offices, a quiet but important part of the statistical world.

Part II Summary and Exercises

PART II SUMMARY

Here are the most important skills you should have acquired after reading Chapters 10 through 16.

A. DISPLAYING DISTRIBUTIONS

Recognize categorical and quantitative variables.

Recognize when a pie chart can and cannot be used.

Make a bar graph of the distribution of a categorical variable or in general to compare related quantities.

Interpret pie charts and bar graphs.

Make a line graph of a quantitative variable over time.

Recognize patterns such as trends and seasonal variation in line graphs.

Be aware of graphical abuses, especially pictograms and distorted scales in line graphs.

Make a histogram of the distribution of a quantitative variable.

Make a stemplot of the distribution of a small set of observations. Round data as needed to make an effective stemplot.

B. DESCRIBING DISTRIBUTIONS (QUANTITATIVE VARIABLE)

Look for the overall pattern of a histogram or stemplot and for major deviations from the pattern.

Assess from a histogram or stemplot whether the shape of a distribution is roughly symmetric, distinctly skewed, or neither. Assess whether the distribution has one or more major peaks.

Describe the overall pattern by giving numerical measures of center and spread in addition to a verbal description of shape.

Decide which measures of center and spread are more appropriate: the mean and standard deviation (especially for symmetric distributions) or the five-number summary (especially for skewed distributions).

Recognize outliers and give plausible explanations for them.

C. NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OF DISTRIBUTIONS

Find the median and the quartiles and for a set of observations.

Give the five-number summary and draw a boxplot; assess center, spread, symmetry, and skewness from a boxplot.

Find the mean and (using a calculator) the standard deviation for a small set of observations.

Understand that the median is less affected by extreme observations than the mean. Recognize that skewness in a distribution moves the mean away from the median toward the long tail.

Know the basic properties of the standard deviation: always; only when all observations are identical and increases as the spread increases; has the same units as the original measurements; is greatly increased by outliers or skewness.

D. NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS

Interpret a density curve as a description of the distribution of a quantitative variable.

Recognize the shape of Normal curves, and estimate by eye both the mean and the standard deviation from such a curve.

Use the 68–95–99.7 rule and symmetry to state what percentage of the observations from a Normal distribution fall between two points when the points lie at the mean or one, two, or three standard deviations on either side of the mean.

Find and interpret the standard score of an observation.

(Optional) Use Table B to find the percentile of a value from any Normal distribution and the value that corresponds to a given percentile.

E. SCATTERPLOTS AND CORRELATION

Make a scatterplot to display the relationship between two quantitative variables measured on the same subjects. Place the explanatory variable (if any) on the horizontal scale of the plot.

Describe the direction, form, and strength of the overall pattern of a scatterplot. In particular, recognize positive or negative association and straight-line patterns. Recognize outliers in a scatterplot.

Judge whether it is appropriate to use correlation to describe the relationship between two quantitative variables. Use a calculator to find the correlation .

Know the basic properties of correlation: measures the strength and direction of only straight-line relationships; is always a number between −1 and 1; only for perfect straight-line relations; moves away from 0 toward as the straight-line relation gets stronger.

F. REGRESSION LINES

Explain what the slope and the intercept mean in the equation of a straight line.

Draw a graph of the straight line when you are given its equation.

Use a regression line, given on a graph or as an equation, to predict for a given . Recognize the danger of prediction outside the range of the available data.

Use the square of the correlation, to describe how much of the variation in one variable can be accounted for by a straight-line relationship with another variable.

G. STATISTICS AND CAUSATION

Understand that an observed association can be due to direct causation, common response, or confounding.

Give plausible explanations for an observed association between two variables: direct cause and effect, the influence of lurking variables, or both.

Assess the strength of statistical evidence for a claim of causation, especially when experiments are not possible.

H. THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND RELATED TOPICS

Calculate and interpret index numbers.

Calculate a fixed market basket price index for a small market basket.

Use the CPI to compare the buying power of dollar amounts from different years. Explain phrases such as「real income.」

PART II REVIEW EXERCISES

Review exercises are short and straightforward exercises that help you solidify the basic ideas and skills in each part of this book. We have provided「hints」that indicate where you can find the relevant material for the odd-numbered problems.

II.1 Poverty in the states. Table II.1 gives the percentages of people living below the poverty line in the 26 states east of the Mississippi River. Make a stemplot of these data. Is the distribution roughly symmetric, skewed to the right, or skewed to the left? Which states (if any) are outliers? (Hint: See page 253.)

II.2 Quarterbacks. Table II.2 gives the total passing yards for National Football League starting quarterbacks during the 2017 season. (These are the quarterbacks with the most games started on each team.) Make a histogram of these data. Does the distribution have a clear shape: roughly symmetric, clearly skewed to the left, clearly skewed to the right, or none of these? Which quarterbacks (if any) are outliers?

Figure II.3 plots the average brain weight in grams versus average body weight in kilograms for many species of mammals. There are many small mammals whose points at the lower left overlap. Exercises II.11 through II.16 are based on this scatterplot.

Figure II.3 Scatterplot of the average brain weight (grams) against the average body weight (kilograms) for 96 species of mammals, Exercises II.11 through II.16.

The body weight in Kilograms is represented along the vertical axis and its values range from 0 to 2800, at an interval of 200. The percent of body weight in grams is represented along the horizontal axis and its values range from 500 to 4500, at an interval of 500. The scatterplot concentrates in the region in close proximity to the origin (0, 0) and (200, 500). The other scattered plots are labeled human at (50, 1250); dolphin at (200, 1700); hippo at (1400, 500); and elephant at (2800, 4500). A line with a uniform positive slope starts from (0, 0) and terminates at (2800, 4000). All data are approximate.

II.11 Dolphins and hippos. The points for the dolphin and hippopotamus are labeled in Figure II.3. Read from the graph the approximate body weight and brain weight for these two species. (Hint: See page 318.)

II.12 Dolphins and hippos. One reaction to this scatterplot is「Dolphins are smart; hippos are dumb.」What feature of the plot lies behind this reaction?

II.13 Outliers. African elephants are much larger than any other mammal in the data set but lie roughly in the overall straight-line pattern. Dolphins, humans, and hippos lie outside the overall pattern. The correlation between body weight and brain weight for the entire data set is

If we removed elephants, would this correlation increase or decrease or not change much? Explain your answer. (Hint: See page 326.)

If we removed dolphins, hippos, and humans, would this correlation increase or decrease or not change much? Explain your answer. (Hint: See page 326.)

II.14 Brain and body. The correlation between body weight and brain weight is How well does body weight explain brain weight for mammals? Compute to answer this question, and briefly explain what tells us.

II.15 Prediction. The line on the scatterplot in Figure II.3 is the least-squares regression line for predicting brain weight from body weight. Suppose that a new mammal species with body weight 600 kilograms is discovered hidden in the rain forest. Predict the brain weight for this species. (Hint: See page 340.)

II.16 Slope. The line on the scatterplot in Figure II.3 is the least-squares regression line for predicting brain weight from body weight. The slope of this line is one of the numbers below. Which number is the slope? Why?

From Rex Boggs in Australia comes an unusual data set: before showering in the morning, he weighed the bar of soap in his shower stall. The weight goes down as the soap is used. The data appear in Table II.3 (weights in grams). Notice that Mr. Boggs forgot to weigh the soap on some days. Exercises II.17, II.18, and II.19 are based on the soap data set.

Table II.3 Weight (grams) of a bar of soap used to shower

Day Weight Day Weight Day Weight

1 124 8 84 16 27

2 121 9 78 18 16

5 103 10 71 19 12

6 96 12 58 20 8

7 90 13 50 21 6

Data from Rex Boggs.

II.17 Scatterplot. Plot the weight of the bar of soap against the day. Is the overall pattern roughly straight-line? Based on your scatterplot, is the correlation between day and weight close to 1, positive but not close to 1, close to 0, negative but not close to −1 or close to −1? Explain your answer. (Hint: See page 325.)

II.18 Regression. The equation for the least-squares regression line for the data in Table II.3 is

Explain carefully what the slope tells us about how fast the soap lost weight.

Mr. Boggs did not measure the weight of the soap on Day 4. Use the regression equation to predict that weight.

Draw the regression line on your scatterplot from the previous exercise.

II.19 Prediction? Use the regression equation in the previous exercise to predict the weight of the soap after 30 days. Why is it clear that your answer makes no sense? What’s wrong with using the regression line to predict weight after 30 days? (Hint: See page 345.)

II.20 Keeping up with the Joneses. The Jones family had a household income of $60,000 in 2000, when the average CPI was 172.2. The average CPI for 2018 was 251.0. How much must the Joneses earn in 2018 to have the same buying power they had in 2000?

II.21 Affording a Subaru. A Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited cost $27,245 in 2005, when the average CPI was 195.3. The average CPI for 2018 was 251.0. How many 2018 dollars must you earn to have the same buying power as $27,245 had in 2005? (Hint: See page 374.)

II.22 Affording a Steinway. A Steinway concert grand piano cost $13,500 in 1976. A similar Steinway cost $156,200 in October 2018. Has the cost of the piano gone up or down in real terms? Using Table 16.1 and the fact that the October 2018 CPI was 252.9, give a calculation to justify your answer.

II.23 The price of gold. Some people recommend that investors buy gold「to protect against inflation.」Here are the prices of an ounce of gold at the end of the year for the years between 1985 and 2018. Using Table 16.1, make a graph that shows how the price of gold changed in real terms over this period. Would an investment in gold have protected against inflation by holding its value in real terms?

Year: 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998

Gold price: $384 $344 $384 $388 $294

Year: 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008

Gold price: $279 $310 $410 $603 $872

Year: 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018

Gold price: $1225 $1669 $1266 $1251 $1269

(Hint: See page 372.)

II.24 Friday the 13th. When planning a wedding, are certain dates more or less popular than others? The bar graphs in Figure II.4 are based on data from the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland. They show the average number of marriages in Great Britain that occurred either on any date of the month other than the 13th or on the 13th of the month, for each day of the week, during the period from 1995 to 2015.

Explain why it is not unusual for the average number of weddings to be highest on Fridays and Saturdays.

When a Friday occurs on the 13th day of a month, the average number of weddings is half as much as when a Friday occurs on any other date. What might explain this?

Figure II.4 Bar graphs of the average number of weddings that occur on dates other than the 13th and on the 13th, for each day of the week, from 1995 to 2015, Exercise II.24.

The first bar graph represents the Average number of weddings not on the 13th on the vertical axis and days of the week on the horizontal axis. The data in the graph reads, Monday: 250; Tuesday: 250; Wednesday: 250; Thursday: 750; Friday: 1000; Saturday: 3200; Sunday: 300. The second bar graph represents the Average number of weddings not on the 13th on the vertical axis and days of the week on the horizontal axis. The data in the graph reads, Monday: 200; Tuesday: 150; Wednesday: 350; Thursday: 400; Friday: 500; Saturday: 2600; Sunday: 150.

II.25 Drive time. Professor Moore, who lives a few miles outside a college town, records the time he takes to drive to the college each morning. Here are the times (in minutes) for 42 consecutive weekdays, with the dates in order along the rows:

8.25 7.83 8.30 8.42 8.50 8.67 8.17

9.00 9.00 8.17 7.92 9.00 8.50 9.00

7.75 7.92 8.00 8.08 8.42 8.75 8.08

9.75 8.33 7.83 7.92 8.58 7.83 8.42

7.75 7.42 6.75 7.42 8.50 8.67 10.17

8.75 8.58 8.67 9.17 9.08 8.83 8.67

Make a histogram of these drive times. Is the distribution roughly symmetric, clearly skewed, or neither? Are there any clear outliers? (Hint: See page 247.)

Make a line graph of the drive times. (Label the horizontal axis in days, 1 to 42.) The plot shows no clear trend, but it does show one unusually low drive time and two unusually high drive times. Circle these observations on your plot. (Hint: See page 223.)

II.26 Drive time outliers. In the previous exercise, there are three outliers in Professor Moore’s drive times to work. All three can be explained. The low time is the day after Thanksgiving (no traffic on campus). The two high times reflect delays due to an accident and icy roads. Remove these three observations. To summarize normal drive times, use a calculator to find the mean and standard deviation of the remaining 39 times.

II.27 House prices. A May 23, 2018, article in the Los Angeles Times reported that the median housing price in Southern California was about $520,000. Would the mean housing price be higher, about the same, or lower? Why? (Hint: See page 281.)

II.28 The 2016 election. Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 with 46.4% of the popular vote.

II.29 Statistics for investing. Joe’s retirement plan invests in stocks through an「index fund」that follows the behavior of the stock market as a whole, as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Joe wants to buy a mutual fund that does not track the index closely. He reads that monthly returns from Fidelity Technology Fund have correlation with the S&P 500 index and that Fidelity Real Estate Fund has correlation with the index.

Which of these funds has the closer relationship to returns from the stock market as a whole? How do you know? (Hint: See page 325.)

Does the information given tell Joe anything about which fund has had higher returns? (Hint: See page 328.)

PART III Chance

If chance will have me king, why, chance will crown me.」So said Macbeth in Shakespeare’s great play. Chance does indeed play with us all, and we can do little to understand or manage it. Sometimes, however, chance is tamed. A roll of dice, a simple random sample, even the inheritance of eye color or blood type, represent chance tied down so that we can understand and manage it. Unlike Macbeth’s life or ours, we can roll the dice again. And again, and again. The outcomes are governed by chance, but in many repetitions a pattern emerges. Chance is no longer mysterious because we can describe its pattern.

We use mathematics to describe regular patterns, whether the circles and triangles of geometry or the movements of the planets. We use mathematics to understand the regular patterns of chance behavior when chance is tamed in a setting where we can repeat the same chance phenomenon again and again. The mathematics of chance is called probability. Probability is the topic of this part of the book, though we will go light on the math in favor of experimenting and thinking.
