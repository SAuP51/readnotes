Case Study: Marijuana and Driving Performance

What is the relationship between the dose of marijuana and driving performance? How long is driving impaired after using marijuana? How can marijuana use be tested by law enforcement in the field? Researchers at the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California, San Diego, recruited participants between January 2017 and June 2019 to determine the answers to these questions. Participants had to be licensed drivers aged 21–55 who have 20/40 or better vision, with or without correction. Participants could not join the study if an examining physician excluded them, if they were unwilling to abstain from marijuana use for two days prior to the screening and the experimental visits, if they were pregnant, if they tested positive for a selection of drugs, and/or if they were unwilling to refrain from driving or operating heavy machinery for four hours after taking the study medication. The study medication was randomized to study participants in the following doses: placebo (0% THC), 5.9% THC, 13.4% THC.

Many adults would like to be participants in such an experiment. But is it ethical to have subjects consume either the 5.9% or 13.4% THC so that their judgment is impaired?

First Principles

The production and use of data, like all human endeavors, raise ethical questions. We won’t discuss the telemarketer who begins a telephone sales pitch with「I’m conducting a survey,」when the goal is to sell you something rather than collect useful information. Such deception is clearly unethical. It enrages legitimate survey organizations, which find the public less willing to talk with them. Neither will we discuss those few researchers who, in the pursuit of professional advancement, publish fake data. There is no ethical question here—faking data to advance your career is just wrong. It will end your career when uncovered. But just how honest must researchers be about real, unfaked data? Here is an example that suggests the answer is「More honest than they often are.」

Example 1

Missing details

Papers reporting scientific research are supposed to be short, with no extra baggage. Brevity can allow the researchers to avoid complete honesty about their data. Did they choose their subjects in a biased way? Did they report data on only some of their subjects? Did they try several statistical analyses and report only the ones that supported what the researchers hoped to find? Statistician John Bailar screened more than 4000 medical papers in more than a decade as consultant to the New England Journal of Medicine. He wrote,「When it came to the statistical review, it was often clear that critical information was lacking, and the gaps nearly always had the practical effect of making the authors’ conclusions look stronger than they should have.」The situation is no doubt worse in fields that screen published work less carefully.

The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people (but research with animals also raises ethical issues). The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by any study that gathers data from human subjects, whether sample survey or experiment.

Basic data ethics

The organization that carries out the study must have an institutional review board that reviews all planned studies in advance in order to protect the subjects from possible harm.

All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their informed consent before data are collected.

All individual data must be kept confidential. Only statistical summaries for groups of subjects may be made public.

If subjects are minor children, then their assent (agreement to participate in the research) is needed in addition to permission from their parent(s) or guardian(s). The parental/guardian permission must meet the standards of informed consent.

Many journals have a formal requirement of explicitly addressing human subjects issues if the study is classified as human subjects research. For example, here is a statement from the instructions for authors for JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association):

For all manuscripts reporting data from studies involving human participants or animals, formal review and approval, or formal review and waiver, by an appropriate institutional review board or ethics committee is required and should be described in the Methods section.

For situations where a formal ethics review committee does not exist, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki should be followed. Researchers working with human subjects should state in the Methods section how informed consent was obtained from the study participants (e.g., oral or written) and whether a stipend was given to study participants. Journal editors may request that manuscript authors provide documentation of the formal review and recommendation from the institutional review board or ethics committee responsible for oversight of the study. Also, the law requires that studies funded by the federal government obey these principles. But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is completely clear about the details of the application of these principles.

Institutional Review Boards

The purpose of an institutional review board (often abbreviated IRB) is not to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether it is statistically sound. The board’s purpose is, in the words of one university’s board,「to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) recruited to participate in research activities.」The board reviews the plan of the study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to ensure that subjects are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once research begins, the board may monitor progress of the study.

The most pressing issue concerning institutional review boards is whether their workload has become so large that the IRB itself is no longer effective at protecting research subjects. When the government temporarily stopped human-subject research at Duke University Medical Center in 1999 due to inadequate protection of subjects, more than 2000 studies at Duke were in progress. That’s a lot of review work. There are shorter review procedures for projects that involve only minimal risks to subjects, such as most sample surveys or research involving commonly accepted educational practices. When a board is overloaded, there is a temptation to put more proposals in the minimal-risk category to speed the work.

Now it’s your turn

7.1 Does this really need to be reviewed? A college professor would like to investigate a new method for teaching statistics. He teaches two lecture sections. He will use the standard approach to teaching in one lecture section and the new approach in the other section. Should he seek institutional review board approval before proceeding? Explain your reasoning.

Informed Consent

Both words in the phrase「informed consent」are important, and both can be controversial. Subjects must be informed in advance about the nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample survey, physical harm is not possible. The subjects should be told what kinds of questions the survey will ask and about how much of their time it will take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects must then consent, usually in writing.

Example 2

Who can consent?

Are there some subjects who can’t give informed consent? It was once common, for example, to test new vaccines on prison inmates who gave their consent in return for good-behavior credit. Now we worry that prisoners are not really free to refuse, and the law forbids medical experiments in prisons.

Children can’t give fully informed consent, so the usual procedure is to ask them for assent and their parent(s) or guardian(s) for permission that meets the standards of informed consent. A study of new ways to teach reading is about to start at a local elementary school, so the study team sends consent forms home to parents. Many parents don’t return the forms. Can their children take part in the study because the parents did not say「No,」or should we allow only children whose parents returned the form and said「Yes」? Should the children whose parents did not return the form be given the placebo treatment (the standard way to teach reading) and the children whose parents returned the form and said「Yes」be taught with the new way to teach reading?

What about research into new medical treatments for people with mental health disorders? What about research into new teaching techniques for people with an intellectual disability? What about studies of new ways to help emergency room patients who may be unconscious or have suffered a stroke? In most cases, like an emergency room, there is no time even to get the consent of the family. Does the principle of informed consent prohibit realistic trials of new treatments for unconscious patients?

These are questions without clear answers. Reasonable people differ strongly on all of them. There is nothing simple about informed consent.

Now it’s your turn

7.2 Informed consent? A 72-year-old man with multiple sclerosis is hospitalized. His doctor feels he may need to be placed on a feeding tube soon to ensure adequate nourishment. He asks the patient about this in the morning and the patient agrees. However, in the evening (before the tube has been placed), the patient becomes disoriented and seems confused about his decision to have the feeding tube placed. He tells the doctor he doesn’t want it in. The doctor revisits the question in the morning, when the patient is again lucid. Unable to recall his state of mind from the previous evening, the patient again agrees to the procedure. Do you believe the patient has given informed consent to the procedure? Explain your reasoning.

Statistics in Your World

Statisticians, honest and dishonest Developed nations rely on government statisticians to produce honest data. We trust the monthly unemployment rate, for example, to guide both public and private decisions. Honesty can’t be taken for granted, however. In 1998, the Russian government arrested top statisticians in the State Committee for Statistics, who were accused of taking bribes to fudge data to help companies avoid taxes. In 2017, Andreas Georgiou, the former top statistician of Greece, was convicted and given a suspended sentence for a「violation of duty.」Did Georgiou really violate his duty? According to The Independent,「Georgiou’s real ‘crime’ was, finally, starting to tell the truth about the extent of Greece’s public sector borrowing in 2010.」

The difficulties of informed consent do not vanish even for capable subjects. Some researchers, especially in medical trials, regard consent as a barrier to getting patients to participate in research. The researchers may not explain all possible risks; they may not point out that there are other therapies or treatments that might be better than those being studied; they may be too optimistic when talking with patients even when the consent form has all the right details. On the other hand, mentioning every possible risk leads to very long consent forms that really are barriers. Long consent forms are like the very detailed documents we are asked to read when we upgrade to a new operating system on our smartphones. One lawyer said that consent forms「are like rental car contracts.」Some subjects don’t read forms that run five or six printed pages. Some subjects may not be able to read and must have the consent forms read to them. However, these subjects might not want to tell the researchers that they are illiterate. Other subjects are frightened by the large number of possible (but unlikely) disasters that might happen and so refuse to participate. Of course, unlikely disasters sometimes happen. When they do, lawsuits follow, and the consent forms become yet longer and more detailed.

Confidentiality

Ethical problems do not disappear once a study has been cleared by the institutional review board and once the researchers have obtained consent from their subjects and have actually collected data from the subjects. It is important to protect the subjects’ privacy by keeping all data about individuals confidential. In other words, while the researcher knows the identity of the research subjects, the researcher keeps all identifying information private to protect any subject’s identity from being discovered by others. For example, the report of an opinion poll may say what percentage of the 1500 respondents felt that legal immigration should be reduced. It may not report what you said about this or any other issue.

Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity. Anonymity means that subjects are anonymous—the subjects’ names are not known to anyone involved in the study, not even to the director of the study. In other words, there are no identifying values in the study that would allow the researcher to identify a specific subject. It is not possible to determine which subject produced which data. Anonymity is rare in statistical studies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail, email, or the Internet), it prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform subjects of results.

Statistics in Your World

Who owns published data? A researcher gathers data and publishes it. Who owns the data? The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that「data」are facts and cannot be copyrighted. However, compilations of facts are generally copyrightable. So the answer to who owns data is not always clear. No permission is required for the use of published data or the creative use of a subset of data. Data from a table used to make a graphical presentation or data read from a graph can be used freely without permission. But beyond these guidelines, there is tremendous variation in determining whether permission is needed.

Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best practice is to separate the identity of the subjects from the rest of the data at once. Typically, the researchers de-identify the data by separating the personally identifiable data from the data of interest to the study. The de-identified data can then be analyzed. For example, sample surveys use the identification only to check on who did or did not respond. But, in this era of advanced technology, it is no longer enough to be sure that each individual set of data protects people’s privacy. The U.S. government, for example, maintains a vast amount of information about citizens in many separate databases—census responses, tax returns, Social Security information, data from surveys such as the Current Population Survey, and so on. Many of these databases can be searched by computers for statistical studies. A clever computer search of several databases might be able, by combining information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and other identification have been removed from the data available for search. A colleague from Germany once remarked that「female full professor of statistics with a PhD from the United States」was enough to identify her among all the 83 million residents of Germany. Privacy and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age. Computer hacking and thefts of laptops containing data add to the difficulties. Is it even possible to guarantee confidentiality of data stored in databases that can be hacked or stolen? Figure 7.1 displays the Internet privacy policy that appears on the U.S. Social Security website.

Example 3

Use of government databases

Citizens are required to give information to the government. Think of tax returns and Social Security contributions, for example, in the United States. The government needs these data for administrative purposes—to see if we paid the right amount of tax and how large a Social Security benefit we are owed when we retire. Some people feel that individuals should be able to forbid any other use of their data, even with all identification removed. This would prevent using government records to study, say, the ages, incomes, and household sizes of Social Security recipients. Such a study could well be vital to debates on reforming Social Security.

Now it’s your turn

7.3 Anonymous or confidential? Consider two at-home tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The first is a swab of your gums that gives you results in 20 minutes. Another at-home HIV test has you prick your finger to get a small amount of blood. You mail your blood sample to a lab and get your results in about a week. With both of these at-home HIV tests, nothing is reported to your insurance or placed in your medical records. Does this practice offer anonymity or confidentiality? Explain your reasoning.

Clinical Trials

Clinical trials are experiments that study the effectiveness of medical treatments on actual patients. Medical treatments can harm as well as heal, so clinical trials spotlight the ethical problems of experiments with human subjects. Here are the starting points for a discussion:

Randomized comparative experiments are the only way to see the true effects of new treatments. Without them, risky treatments that are no better than placebos could become common.

Clinical trials produce great benefits, but most of these benefits go to future patients. The trials also pose risks, and these risks are borne by the subjects of the trial. So we must balance future benefits against present risks.

Both medical ethics and international human rights standards say that「While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.」

The above quoted words are from the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki (first adopted in 1964, most recently updated in 2013), which is the most respected international standard. The most outrageous examples of unethical experiments are those that ignore the interests of the subjects.

Example 4

The Tuskegee syphilis study

In the 1930s, syphilis was common among black men in the rural South of the United States, a group that had almost no access to medical care. The Public Health Service recruited 399 poor black sharecroppers with syphilis and 201 others without the disease in order to observe how syphilis progressed when no treatment was given. Beginning in 1943, penicillin became available to treat syphilis. However, the study subjects were not treated, even after penicillin became a standard treatment for syphilis. In fact, the Public Health Service tried to prevent any treatment until word leaked out and forced an end to the study in 1972.

The Tuskegee study is an extreme example of investigators following their own interests and ignoring the well-being of their subjects. A 1996 review said,「It has come to symbolize racism in medicine, ethical misconduct in human research, paternalism by physicians, and government abuse of vulnerable people.」In 1997, President Clinton formally apologized to the surviving participants in a White House ceremony.

The Tuskegee study helps explain to many of us the lack of trust that lies behind the reluctance of many African Americans to take part in clinical trials:「From a historical perspective, the Tuskegee syphilis study is widely recognized as a reason for mistrust because of the extent and duration of deception and mistreatment and the study’s impact on human subject review and approval.」Unfortunately, African Americans have not only been impacted by the Tuskegee study. There have been enough studies that have taken advantage of African Americans for Harriet S. Washington to write the 528-page book Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present. Washington’s documentation of the mistreatment that African Americans have experienced in the name of research explains even more why many African Americans are reluctant to participate in clinical trials.

Because「the interests of the subject must always prevail,」medical treatments can be tested in clinical trials only when there is reason to hope that they will help the patients who are subjects in the trials. Future benefits alone aren’t enough to justify any experiment with human subjects. Of course, if there is already strong evidence that a treatment works and is safe, it is unethical not to give it. Dr. Charles Hennekens of the Harvard Medical School, who directed the large clinical trial that showed that aspirin reduces the risk of heart attacks in men, discussed the issue of when to do or not do a randomized trial. Here are his words:

On the one hand, there must be sufficient belief in the agent’s potential to justify exposing half the subjects to it. On the other hand, there must be sufficient doubt about its efficacy to justify withholding it from the other half of subjects who might be assigned to placebos.

Why is it ethical to give a control group of patients a placebo? Well, we know that placebos often work. Patients on placebos often show real improvement. What is more, placebos have no harmful side effects. So in the state of balanced doubt described by Dr. Hennekens, the placebo group may be getting a better treatment than the drug group. If we knew which treatment was better, we would give it to everyone. When we don’t know, it is ethical to try both and compare them. Here are some harder questions about placebos, with arguments on both sides.

Example 5

Placebo controls?

You are testing a new drug. Is it ethical to give a placebo to a control group if an effective drug already exists?

Yes: The placebo gives a true baseline for the effectiveness of the new drug. There are three groups: new drug, best existing drug, and placebo. Every clinical trial is a bit different, and not even genuinely effective treatments work in every setting. The placebo control helps us see if the study is flawed so that even the best existing drug does not beat the placebo. Sometimes the placebo wins, so the doubt about the efficacy of the new and the existing drugs is justified. Placebo controls are ethical except for life-threatening conditions.

No: It isn’t ethical to deliberately give patients an inferior treatment. We don’t know whether the new drug is better than the existing drug, so it is ethical to give both in order to find out. If past trials showed that the existing drug is better than a placebo, it is no longer right to give patients a placebo. After all, the existing drug includes the placebo effect. A placebo group is ethical only if the existing drug is an older one that did not undergo proper clinical trials, or doesn’t work well, or is dangerous.

Example 6

Sham surgery

「Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard for evaluating new interventions and are routinely used to assess new medical therapies.」So says an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that discusses the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The article isn’t about the new treatment, which offers hope of reducing the tremors and lack of control brought on by the disease, but about the ethics of studying the treatment.

The law requires well-designed experiments to show that new drugs work and are safe. Not so with surgery—only about 7% of studies of surgery use randomized comparisons. Surgeons think their operations succeed, but innovators always think their innovations work. Even if the patients are helped, the placebo effect may deserve most of the credit. So we don’t really know whether many common surgeries are worth the risk they carry. To find out, do a proper experiment. That includes a「sham surgery」to serve as a placebo. In the case of Parkinson’s disease, the promising treatment involves surgery to implant new cells. The placebo subjects get the same surgery, but the cells are not implanted.

Placebos work. Patients on placebos often show improvement, and their inclusion produces a better experiment. As more doctors recognize this fact, more begin to ask,「If we accept a placebo in drug trials, why don’t we accept it in surgery trials?」This is a very controversial question. Here are two arguments about whether placebos should be used in surgery trials.

Yes: Most surgeries have not been tested in comparative experiments, and some are no doubt just placebos. Unlike placebo pills, these surgeries carry risks. Comparing real surgeries to placebo surgeries can eliminate thousands of unnecessary operations and save many lives. The placebo surgery can be made quite safe. For example, placebo patients can be given a safe drug that removes their memory of the operation rather than a more risky anesthetic required for the more serious real surgery. Subjects are told that they are in a placebo-controlled trial and they agree to take part. Placebo-controlled trials of surgery are ethical (except for life-threatening conditions) if the risk to the placebo group is small and there is informed consent.

No: Placebo surgery, unlike placebo drugs, always carries some risk, such as postoperative infection. Remember that「the interests of the subject must always prevail.」Even great future benefits can’t justify risks to subjects today unless those subjects receive some benefit. We might give a patient a placebo drug as a medical therapy because placebos work and are not risky. No doctor would do a sham surgery as ordinary therapy because there is some risk. If we would not use it in medical practice, it isn’t ethical to use it in a clinical trial.

Statistical controversies

Hope for Sale?

We have pointed to the ethical problems of experiments with human subjects, clinical trials in particular. Not doing proper experiments can also pose problems. Here is an example. Women with advanced breast cancer will eventually die. A promising but untried treatment appears.

The promising treatment is bone marrow transplant (BMT for short). The idea of BMT is to harvest a patient’s bone marrow cells, blast the cancer with very high doses of drugs, then return the harvested cells to keep the drugs from killing the patient. BMT has become popular, but it is painful, expensive, and dangerous.

New anticancer drugs are first available through clinical trials, but there is no constraint on therapies such as BMT. When small, uncontrolled trials seemed to show success, BMT became widely available. The economics of medicine had a lot to do with this. The early leaders in offering BMT were for-profit hospitals that advertise heavily to attract patients. Others soon jumped in. The New York Times reported:「Every entity offering the experimental procedure tried a different sales pitch. Some promoted the prestige of their institutions, others the convenience of their locations, others their caring attitudes and patient support.」The profits for hospitals and doctors are high.

Should we have waited for controlled clinical trials to show that the treatment works, or was it right to make it available immediately? What do you think? What are some of the issues one should consider?

Now it’s your turn

7.4 Ethics and scientific research. The authors of a paper on clinical research and ethics stated the following:

For a clinical research protocol to be ethical, [it] must have a clear scientific objective; be designed using accepted principles, methods, and reliable practices; have sufficient power to definitively test the objective; and offer a plausible data analysis plan. [And], it must be possible to execute the proposed study.

Do you think this rules out observational studies as「ethical」? Explain your reasoning.

Behavioral and Social Science Experiments

When we move from medicine to the behavioral and social sciences, the direct risks to experimental subjects are less acute, but so are the possible benefits to the subjects. Consider, for example, the experiments conducted by psychologists in their study of human behavior.

Example 7

Keep out of my space

Psychologists observe that people have a「personal space」and get annoyed if others come too close to them. We don’t like strangers to sit at our table in a coffee shop if other tables are available, and we see people move apart in elevators if there is room to do so. Americans tend to require more personal space than people in most other cultures. Can violations of personal space have physical, as well as emotional, effects?

In the 1970s, investigators set up shop in a men’s public restroom. They blocked off urinals to force men walking in to use either a urinal next to an experimenter (treatment group) or a urinal separated from the experimenter (control group). Another experimenter, using a periscope from a toilet stall, measured how long the subject took to start urinating and how long he kept at it.

This personal space experiment illustrates the difficulties facing those who plan and review behavioral studies.

There is no risk of harm to the subjects, although they would certainly object to being watched through a periscope. What should we protect subjects from when physical harm is unlikely? Possible emotional harm? Undignified situations? Invasion of privacy?

What about informed consent? The subjects in Example 7 did not even know they were participating in an experiment. Many behavioral experiments rely on hiding the true purpose of the study. The subjects would change their behavior if told in advance what the investigators were looking for. Subjects are asked to consent on the basis of vague information. They receive full information only after the experiment.

The「Ethical Principles」of the American Psychological Association require consent unless a study merely observes behavior in a public place. They allow deception only when it is necessary to the study, does not hide information that might influence a subject’s willingness to participate, and is explained to subjects as soon as possible. The personal space study of Example 7 (from the 1970s) does not meet current ethical standards.

We see that the basic requirement for informed consent is understood differently in medicine and psychology. Here is an example of another setting with yet another interpretation of what is ethical. The subjects get no information and give no consent. They don’t even know that an experiment may be sending them to jail for the night.

Example 8

Domestic violence

How should police respond to domestic violence calls? In the past, the usual practice was to remove the offender and order him to stay out of the household overnight. Police were reluctant to make arrests because the victims rarely pressed charges. Women’s groups argued that arresting offenders would help prevent future violence even if no charges were filed. Is there evidence that arrest will reduce future offenses? That’s a question that experiments have tried to answer.

A typical domestic violence experiment compares two treatments: arrest the suspect and hold him overnight or warn the suspect and release him. When police officers reach the scene of a domestic violence call, they calm the participants and investigate. Weapons or death threats require an arrest. If the facts permit an arrest but do not require it, an officer radios headquarters for instructions. The person on duty opens the next envelope in a file prepared in advance by a statistician. The envelopes contain the treatments in random order. The police either arrest the suspect or warn and release him, depending on the contents of the envelope. The researchers then monitor police records and visit the victim to see if the domestic violence reoccurs.

The first such experiment appeared to show that arresting domestic violence suspects does reduce their future violent behavior. As a result of this evidence, arrest has become the common police response to domestic violence.

The domestic violence experiments shed light on an important issue of public policy. Because there is no informed consent, the ethical rules that govern clinical trials and most social science studies would forbid these experiments. They were cleared by review boards because, in the words of one domestic violence researcher,「These people became subjects by committing acts that allow the police to arrest them. You don’t need consent to arrest someone.」

This might be a good place to read the「What’s the verdict?」story on page 158, and to answer the questions. These questions ask you to consider ethical issues surrounding an experiment conducted by Facebook in 2012 involving its users.

Chapter 7 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 7: Statistics in Summary

Data ethics begin with some principles that go beyond just being honest. Studies with human subjects must be screened in advance by an institutional review board.

All subjects must give their informed consent before taking part. If the subjects are minor children, the children must assent before taking part in a research study, but their parent(s) or guardian(s) need to give permission that meets the standards of informed consent.

All information about individual subjects must be kept confidential.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

The production and use of data to make decisions, like all human endeavors, raise ethical questions. In real-world applications of statistics, these must be addressed as part of the process of reasoning from data to a conclusion. The principles discussed in this chapter are a good start in addressing these questions, but many ethical debates remain, especially in the area of experiments with humans. Many of the debates concern the right balance between the welfare of the subjects and the future benefits of the experiment. Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions that can’t be answered without them. Also remember that「the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.」

Insert a tube that remains in the arm so that blood can be drawn regularly.

Take extra specimens from a subject who is undergoing an invasive clinical procedure such as a bronchoscopy (a procedure in which a physician views the inside of the airways for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes using an instrument that is inserted into the airways, usually through the nose or mouth).

7.11 Who serves on the review board? Government regulations require that institutional review boards consist of at least five people, including at least one scientist, one nonscientist, and one person from outside the institution. Most boards are larger, but many contain just one outsider.

Why should review boards contain at least one person who is not a scientist?

Why should review boards contain at least one outsider?

Do you think that one outside member is enough? How would you choose that member? (For example, would you prefer a medical doctor? A member of the clergy? An activist for patients’ rights?)

7.12 Institutional review boards. If your college or university has an institutional review board that screens all studies that use human subjects, get a copy of the document that describes this board (you can probably find it online). At larger institutions you may find multiple institutional review boards—for example, separate boards for medical studies and for studies in the social sciences. If that is the case, choose the institutional review board that is of most interest to you. Note: If you are looking for institutional review board information after January 21, 2019, you might find only one IRB, even at a large institution. This is a change that was instituted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (also known as the「Common Rule").

How many different institutional review boards does your institution have?

According to the document you selected, what are the duties of the board?

How are members of the board chosen? How many members are not scientists? How many members are not employees of the institution? Do these members have some special expertise, or are they simply members of the「general public」?

7.13 Informed consent. A researcher suspects that people who are abused as children tend to be more prone to severe depression as young adults. She prepares a questionnaire that measures depression and that also asks many personal questions about childhood experiences. Write a description of the purpose of this research to be read by subjects in order to obtain their informed consent. You must balance the conflicting goals of not deceiving the subjects as to what the questionnaire will tell about them and of not biasing the sample by scaring off people with painful childhood experiences.

7.14 Is consent needed? In which of the circumstances below would you allow collecting personal information without the subjects’ consent? Why?

A government agency takes a random sample of income tax returns to obtain information on the marital status and average income of people who identify themselves as belonging to an ultraconservative political group. Only the marital status and income are recorded from the returns, not the names.

A social psychologist attends public meetings of an ultraconservative political group to study the behavior patterns of members.

A social psychologist pretends to be converted to membership in an ultraconservative political group and attends private meetings to study the behavior patterns of members.

7.15 Coercion? The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations for informed consent state that「An investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.」Coercion occurs when an overt or implicit threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Which of the following circumstances do you believe constitutes coercion? Explain your reasoning.

An investigator tells a prospective subject that the subject will lose access to needed health services if they do not participate in the research.

An employer asks employees to participate in a research study. Although the employer has assured employees that participation is voluntary, several employees are concerned that a decision to not participate could affect performance evaluations or job advancement.

7.16 Undue influence? Undue influence in obtaining informed consent often occurs through an offer of an excessive or inappropriate reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance. Which of the following circumstances do you believe constitute undue influence? Explain why you answered the way that you did using complete sentences.

The patients of a physician are asked to participate in a study in which the physician is also the investigator.

A professor asks a student to participate in a research study. He tells the student that everyone else in the class has agreed to participate.

Research subjects are paid in exchange for their participation.

A health insurance representative asks insured persons to take a battery of health and blood tests that will help inform future health insurance pricing. The health insurance representative says that people who agree to the tests will get a 10% reduction in their insurance rates for the coming year.

7.17 Students as subjects. Students taking Psychology 001 are required to serve as experimental subjects. Students in Psychology 002 are not required to serve, but they are given extra credit if they do so. Students in Psychology 003 are required either to sign up as subjects or to write a term paper. Serving as an experimental subject may be educational, but current ethical standards frown on using「dependent subjects」such as prisoners or charity medical patients. Students are certainly somewhat dependent on their teachers.

Do you object to any of these course policies? If so, which one(s)? Explain your reasoning.

The University of Virginia’s Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research in its information about subject recruitment states「Investigators proposing to recruit their students, employees or patients as research subjects should justify in the protocol the necessity for the inclusion of the dependent subject. In addition, the IRB will closely scrutinize the precautions in place to prevent the appearance of coercion in the recruitment of subjects.」As a student, explain why you think a policy about recruitment of students as subjects is important.

7.18 How common is HIV infection? Researchers from Yale University, working with medical teams in Tanzania, wanted to know how common infection with the AIDS virus is among pregnant women in that African country. To do this, they planned to test blood samples drawn from pregnant women.

Yale’s institutional review board insisted that the researchers get the informed consent of each woman and tell her the results of the test. This is the usual procedure in developed nations. The Tanzanian government did not want to tell the women why blood was drawn or tell them the test results. The government feared panic if many people turned out to have an incurable disease for which the country’s medical system could not provide care. The study was canceled. Do you think that Yale was right to apply its usual standards for protecting subjects? Explain your answer.

7.19 Anonymous or confidential? One of the most important nongovernment surveys in the United States is the General Social Survey (see Example 7 in Chapter 1). The GSS regularly monitors public opinion on a wide variety of political and social issues. Interviews are conducted in person in the subject’s home. Are a subject’s responses to GSS questions anonymous, confidential, or both? Explain your answer. You may wish to visit the GSS website at http://gss.norc.org/.

7.20 Anonymous or confidential? The website for STDHELP.org contains the following information about one method offered for HIV testing:「The clinic will require you to provide some information that allows them to deliver your results. Typically a random numeric code is used for identification, and your name or social security number are never used in the process. There are no written results that are documented …」Does this practice offer anonymity or just confidentiality? Explain your reasoning.

7.21 Anonymous or confidential? A website is looking for volunteers for a research study involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacterial infection that is highly resistant to some antibiotics. The website contains the following information about the study:「The Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics is looking for individuals who have or have had MRSA to fill out an anonymous survey and provide suggestions on how to improve treatment. The survey will help us to find out more about the concerns of people affected by MRSA …」Following the announcement is a web link that takes you to the questionnaire. Does this study really provide anonymity or just confidentiality? Explain your reasoning.

7.22 Sunshine laws. All U.S. states have open records laws, sometimes known as「Sunshine Laws,」that give citizens access to government meetings and records. This includes, for example, reports of crimes and recordings of 911 calls. Crime reports will include the names of anyone accused of the crime. Suppose a 10-year-old juvenile is accused of committing a crime. A reporter from the local newspaper asks for a copy of the crime report. The sheriff refuses to provide the report because the accused is a juvenile and the sheriff believes the name of the accused should be confidential. Is this an issue of confidentiality? Explain your reasoning.

7.23 https. Generally, secure websites use encryption and authentication standards to protect the confidentiality of web transactions. The most commonly used protocol for web security has been TLS, or Transport Layer Security. This technology is still commonly referred to as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). According to Symantec Corporation,「HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate.」

Do you believe that https websites provide true confidentially? Do you think it is possible to guarantee the confidentiality of data on any website? Explain your reasoning.

As of July 2018, Google’s Chrome browser began showing「http」websites as「Not secure.」(「https」websites do not carry this warning.) In what ways do you think this move by Google is ethical? Unethical? Explain your reasoning.

7.24 Not really anonymous. Some common practices may appear to offer anonymity while actually delivering only confidentiality. Market researchers often use mail, email, or Internet surveys that do not explicitly ask the respondent’s identity but contain hidden codes on the questionnaire that identify the respondent. A false claim of anonymity is clearly unethical. If only confidentiality is promised, is it also unethical to say nothing about the identifying code, perhaps causing respondents to believe their replies are anonymous? Explain your reasoning.

7.25 Human biological materials. Long ago, doctors drew a blood specimen from you as part of treating minor anemia. Unknown to you, the sample was stored. Now researchers plan to use stored samples from you and many other people to look for genetic factors that may influence anemia. It is no longer possible to ask your consent because you are no longer alive. Modern technology can read your entire genetic makeup from the blood sample.

Do you think it violates the principle of informed consent to use your blood sample if your name is on it but you were not told that it might be saved and studied later? Explain your reasoning.

Suppose that your name is not attached to the sample. The blood sample is known only to come from (say)「a 20-year-old white female being treated for anemia.」Is it now okay to use the sample for research? Explain your reasoning.

Perhaps we should use biological materials such as blood samples only from patients who have agreed to allow the material to be stored for later use in research. It isn’t possible to say in advance what kind of research, so this falls short of the usual standard for informed consent. Is this practice nonetheless acceptable, given complete confidentiality and the fact that using the sample can’t physically harm the patient? Explain your reasoning.

7.26 Equal treatment. Researchers on depression proposed to investigate the effect of supplemental therapy and counseling on the quality of life of adults with depression. Eligible patients on the rolls of a large medical clinic were to be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group would be offered dental care, vision testing, transportation, and other services not available without charge to the control group. The review board felt that providing these services to some but not other persons in the same institution raised ethical questions. Do you agree? Explain your answer.

7.27 Sham surgery? Clinical trials like the Parkinson’s disease study mentioned in Example 6 are becoming more common. One medical researcher says,「This is just the beginning. Tomorrow, if you have a new procedure, you will have to do a double-blind placebo trial.」Example 6 outlines the arguments for and against testing surgery just as drugs are tested. When would you allow sham surgery in a clinical trial of a new surgery? Explain your reasoning.

7.28 The Willowbrook hepatitis studies. In the 1960s, children entering the Willowbrook State School, an institution for the mentally retarded, were deliberately infected with hepatitis. The researchers argued that almost all children in the institution quickly became infected anyway. The studies showed for the first time that two strains of hepatitis existed. This finding contributed to the development of effective vaccines. Despite these valuable results, the Willowbrook studies are now considered an example of unethical research. Explain why, according to current ethical standards, useful results are not enough to allow a study.

7.29 AIDS clinical trials. Now that effective treatments for AIDS are available, is it ethical to test treatments that may be less effective? Combinations of several powerful drugs reduce the level of HIV in the blood and at least delay illness and death from complications due to AIDS. But effectiveness depends on how damaged the patient’s immune system is and what drugs the patient has previously taken. There are strong side effects, and patients must be able to take more than a dozen pills at one time every day. Because AIDS is often fatal and the combination therapy works, we might argue that it isn’t ethical to test any new treatment for AIDS that might possibly be less effective. But that might prevent discovery of better treatments. This is a strong example of the conflict between doing the best we know for patients now and finding better treatments for other patients in the future. How can we ethically test new drugs for AIDS?

7.30 AIDS trials in Africa. Effective drugs for treating AIDS are very expensive, so most African nations cannot afford to give them to large numbers of people. Yet AIDS is more common in parts of Africa than anywhere else. A few clinical trials are looking at ways to prevent pregnant mothers infected with HIV from passing the infection to their unborn children, a major source of HIV infections in Africa. Some people say these trials are unethical because they do not give effective AIDS drugs to their subjects, as would be required in rich nations. Others reply that the trials are looking for treatments that can work in the real world in Africa, and that they promise benefits at least to the children of their subjects. What do you think?

7.31 AIDS trials in Africa. One of the most important goals of AIDS research is to find a vaccine that will protect against HIV. Because AIDS is so common in parts of Africa, that is the easiest place to test a vaccine. It is likely, however, that a vaccine would be so expensive that it could not (at least at first) be widely used in Africa. Is it ethical to test in Africa if the benefits go mainly to rich countries? The treatment group of subjects would get the vaccine, and the placebo group would later be given the vaccine if it proved effective. So the actual subjects would benefit—it is the future benefits that would go elsewhere. What do you think? Explain your answer.

7.32 Henrietta Lacks. You may have heard of the book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot (2010) or the Oprah Winfrey movie based on the book. Henrietta Lacks came from an impoverished tobacco farming family in Virginia. In 1951, when Henrietta was 31, she died at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from complications due to cervical cancer. While Henrietta died in 1951, some of her cells live on to this day. The cells were originally taken without Henrietta Lacks’s permission. These same cells「became the immortal He-La cell line used for extensive bio-medical research and then commodified in a multi-million dollar industry.」The He-La cells have been used to develop the polio vaccine and flu treatments and in HIV/AIDS, leukemia, tuberculosis, and Parkinson’s disease research, just to name a few applications.

The research from He-La cells has saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Does the benefit society received from the「immortal" cells of Henrietta Lacks outweigh the ethics of anyone in the Lacks family, including Henrietta herself, never being asked for permission to use the cells? Explain your reasoning.

Suppose that you found out that you had「immortal" cells that would allow researchers to develop vaccines or treatments for HIV, tuberculosis, Alzheimer’s disease, etc.? What information would you want from the doctor before the doctor shared the discovery of your immortal cells with others? What payment do you think you should get from the biomedical research done and pharmaceutical industry?

7.33 The Stanford Prison Experiment. You may have seen or heard about the film The Stanford Prison Experiment (2015), which centered around Philip Zimbardo’s 1971 research on psychologically healthy individuals placed into a stressful situation, to answer the question about how context impacts human behavior. Zimbardo wondered,「what happens when you put good people in an evil place? Does humanity win over evil, or does evil triumph?" The study was planned for two weeks, but ended shortly before one week had passed because of experimenter concerns about signs of sadism in the guards and signs of extreme depression and stress in the prisoners. You can find more information about the actual experiment at http://www.prisonexp.org/.

The consent form subjects signed can be found at http://pdf.prisonexp.org/consentpdf. Does this meet the standards of informed consent that you have studied in this chapter? Explain your reasoning.

According to the Stanford Prison Experiment website,「despite suffering extreme emotional stress during the experiment, all participants appear to have regained their baseline emotional states after the study. Extensive follow-up testing revealed no lasting trauma to participants.」Does this mitigate what the subjects experienced in the experiment? Explain your reasoning.

7.34 Opinion polls. The congressional campaigns are in full swing, and the candidates have hired polling organizations to take regular polls to find out what the voters think about the issues. What information should the pollsters be required to give out?

What does the standard of informed consent, as discussed in this chapter, require the pollsters to tell potential respondents?

The standards accepted by polling organizations also require giving respondents the name and address of the organization that carries out the poll. Why do you think this is required?

The polling organization usually has a professional name such as「Samples Incorporated,」so respondents don’t know that the poll is being paid for by a political party or candidate. Would revealing the sponsor to respondents bias the poll? Should the sponsor always be announced whenever poll results are made public?

7.35 A right to know? Some people think that the law should require that all political poll results be made public. Otherwise, the possessors of poll results can use the information to their own advantage. They can act on the information, release only selected parts of it, or time the release for best effect. A candidate’s organization replies that they are paying for the poll in order to gain information for their own use, not to amuse the public. Do you favor requiring complete disclosure of political poll results? What about other private surveys, such as market research surveys of consumer tastes?

7.36 Telling the government. The 2010 census was a short-form-only census. The decennial long form was eliminated. The American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form in 2010 and will collect long-form-type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. The 2010 ACS asked detailed questions, for example:

Does this house, apartment, or mobile home have a) hot and cold piped water?; b) a flush toilet?; c) a bathtub or shower?; d) a sink or faucet?; e) a stove or range?; f) a refrigerator?; and g) telephone service from which you can both make and receive calls? Include cell phones.

The form also asked your individual income in dollars, broken down by source, and whether any「physical, mental, or emotional condition」causes you difficulty in「concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.」

Give brief arguments for and against the use of the ACS form: the government has legitimate uses for such information, but the questions seem to invade people’s privacy.

7.37 Charging for data? Data produced by the government are often available free or at low cost to private users. For example, satellite weather data produced by the U.S. National Weather Service are available free to TV stations for their weather reports and to anyone on the Web.

Opinion 1: Government data should be available to everyone at minimal cost.

European governments, on the other hand, charge TV stations for weather data.

Opinion 2: The satellites are expensive, and the TV stations are making a profit from their weather services, so they should share the cost.

Which opinion do you support, and why?

7.38 Surveys of youth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a survey of teenagers, asked the subjects if they had ever had sexual intercourse. Males who said「Yes」were then asked,「That very first time that you had sexual intercourse with a female, how old were you?」and「Please tell me the name or initials of your first sexual partner so that I can refer to her during the interview.」Should consent of parents be required to ask minors about sex, drugs, and other such issues, or is consent of the minors themselves enough? Give reasons for your opinion.

7.39 Deceiving subjects. Students sign up to be subjects in a psychology experiment. When they arrive, they are placed in a room and assigned a task. During the task, the subject hears a loud thud from an adjacent room and then a piercing cry for help. Some subjects are placed in a room by themselves. Others are placed in a room with「confederates」(a research methods term for accomplices) who have been instructed by the researcher to look up upon hearing the cry, then return to their task. The treatments being compared are whether the subject is alone in the room or in the room with confederates. Will the subject ignore the cry for help?

The students had agreed to take part in an unspecified study, and the true nature of the experiment is explained to them afterward. Do you think this study is ethically okay?

7.40 Tempting subjects. A psychologist conducts the following experiment: he measures the attitude of subjects toward cheating, then has them take a mathematics skills exam in which the subjects are tempted to cheat. Subjects are told that high scores will receive a $100.00 gift certificate and that the purpose of the experiment is to see if rewards affect performance. The exam is computer-based and multiple choice. Subjects are left alone in a room with a computer on which the exam is available and are told that they are to click on the answer they believe is correct. However, when subjects click on an answer a small pop-up window appears with the correct answer indicated. When the pop-up window is closed, it is possible to change the answer selected. The computer records—unknown to the subjects—whether or not they change their answers after closing the pop-up window. After completing the exam, attitude toward cheating is retested.

Subjects who cheat tend to change their attitudes to find cheating more acceptable. Those who resist the temptation to cheat tend to condemn cheating more strongly on the second test of attitude. These results confirm the psychologist’s theory.

This experiment tempts subjects to cheat. The subjects are led to believe that they can cheat secretly when in fact they are observed. Is this experiment ethically objectionable? Explain your position.

What’s the Verdict?

The following「What’s the verdict?」story explores issues surrounding an experiment conducted by Facebook in 2012. You will use what you have learned in this chapter to explore ethical issues associated with this experiment,

In January 2012, Facebook performed an experiment on over 689,000 users without informing them even after the experiment was over. Facebook adjusted people’s newsfeeds so that half of these individuals only saw happy posts from their friends and the other half only saw sad posts from their friends. Facebook then determined the mood of the user by judging the quality of their own posts. Why would Facebook want to learn how to manipulate emotions? It is well known that sad people tend to shop more, and Facebook sells advertisement space on their site.

Did Facebook behave ethically? That is an interesting question in today’s social media world.

Questions

WTV7.1. Review board approval: Any organization that receives federal funding must receive review board approval for research with humans. Facebook does not receive federal funding. Facebook partnered with Cornell University to write the article and analyze the data after the experiment was already performed. (www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full) The researcher at Cornell consulted his institutional review board to get approval for his part of this work, but since his involvement started after the experiment was already completed, his review board said that he did not need approval from them. How do you feel about this experiment happening without a review board?

WTV7.2. Confidentiality: Facebook did take an unusual step for a business by publishing their results from this experiment in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a prestigious journal. Facebook knew who all of the individuals were and what they had posted, but Facebook did not publish any individual information in the article. Did they use confidentiality?

WTV7.3. Informed consent: Facebook claims that their data privacy policy covered this experiment because it included this line:「For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you … for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.」Do you agree that this policy does enough to count as informed consent? Discuss your reasoning.

WTV7.4. Sometimes exceptions can be made to the informed consent process. Examples include education research studies with normal classroom activities posing no unusual risks (like trying a lecture vs. an active learning activity to teach a new concept) or behavioral studies in a public place. These ethical guidelines were written in the middle of the twentieth century, well before the Internet and social media existed. Do you believe that Facebook and other social media sites count as a「public place」? If so, does that change your answer to whether informed consent was necessary for this experiment?

WTV7.5. Social media can be a powerful research tool with large quantities of data available. However, we have not developed many rules for how this data can be used or analyzed yet. Read about the European Union’s General Data Protection Rules (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en) to see if you agree with them. Can you think of any other rules you would like to have for researchers working with social media data?

What’s the verdict? Social media research may or may not fit into our basic ethical rules developed in the twentieth century, and as a society we will have to decide if new rules should be developed to protect us while still allowing us to learn from the rich data available.
