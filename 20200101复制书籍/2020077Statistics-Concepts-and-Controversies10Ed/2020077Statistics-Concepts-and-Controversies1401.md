Learn how to examine relations among quantitative variables.

Case Study: SAT Scores

The news media have a weakness for lists. Best places to live, best colleges, healthiest foods, most popular dog breeds … a list of best or worst is sure to find a place in the news. When the state-by-state SAT scores come out each year, it’s therefore no surprise that we find news articles ranking the states from best (Minnesota in 2017) to worst (District of Columbia in 2017) according to the average SAT Mathematics score achieved by their high school seniors. Unfortunately, such reports leave readers believing that schools in the District of Columbia must be much worse than those in Minnesota. Where does your home state rank? And do you believe the ranking reflects the quality of education you received?

The College Board, which sponsors the SAT exams, doesn’t like this practice at all. In fact, the following caveat is included in the annual report the College Board prepares to summarize SAT results for each state:「The College Board strongly discourages using scores to compare or evaluate teachers, schools, districts, or states, because of differences in participation and test taker populations. Relationships between test scores and other background or contextual factors are complex and interdependent.」To see why, let’s look at the data.

Figure 14.1 shows the distribution of average scores on the SAT Mathematics exam for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Minnesota leads at 651, and the District of Columbia trails at 468 on the SAT scale of 200 to 800. The distribution has one clear peak and is skewed to the right.

Figure 14.1 Histogram of the average scores of students in the 50 states and the District of Columbia on the SAT Mathematics exam.

Data in the histogram are as follows:

State average, 460 to 490; Number of students, 1

State average, 490 to 520; Number of students, 9

State average, 520 to 550; Number of students, 16

State average, 550 to 580; Number of students, 8

State average, 580 to 610; Number of students, 8

State average, 610 to 640; Number of students, 7

State average, 640 to 670; Number of students, 2

To understand one variable, such as SAT scores, we must look at how it is related to other variables. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to use what you have learned to appreciate why the College Board discourages ranking states on SAT scores alone.

A medical study finds that short women are more likely to have heart attacks than women of average height, while tall women have the fewest heart attacks. An insurance group reports that heavier cars are involved in fewer fatal accidents per 10,000 vehicles registered than are lighter cars. These and many other statistical studies look at the relationship between two variables. To understand such a relationship, we must often examine other variables as well. To conclude that shorter women have a higher risk of heart attacks, for example, the researchers had to eliminate the effect of other variables such as weight and exercise habits. Our topic in this and the following chapters is relationships between variables. One of our main themes is that the relationship between two quantitative variables can be strongly influenced by other variables that are lurking in the background.

Many statistical studies examine data on more than one quantitative variable. Fortunately, statistical analysis of several-variable data builds on the tools we used to examine individual variables. The principles that guide our work also remain the same:

First plot the data, then add numerical summaries.

Look for overall patterns and deviations from those patterns.

When the overall pattern is quite regular, there is sometimes a way to describe it very briefly.

Scatterplots

The most common way to display the relation between two quantitative variables is a scatterplot.

Example 1

Healthy foods

For those who want to watch their weight and follow a nutritious diet, it isn’t difficult to find guidelines and recommendations for healthy eating. One example is the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which is a publication put out every five years by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). In the 2015–2020 edition of this publication, it is recommended that individuals「consume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.」A variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, proteins, and oils are included in this「healthy eating pattern.」

Naturally, this begs the question of whether Americans are any good at identifying healthy foods. Are the foods nutrition experts consider to be「healthy」the same as the foods an average American adult would consider to be「healthy」? According to a 2016 article published in the New York Times, when a survey was conducted of a representative sample of American voters, the types of foods these voters considered to be healthy didn’t always align with the types of foods a panel of nutritionists identified as being healthy. A list was prepared of 52 food items, and the list was shared with 2000 registered voters and 672 nutrition experts who were members of the American Society for Nutrition. Figure 14.2 is a scatterplot that shows how the percentage of nutritionists who identified food items as being healthy compared with the percentage of American voters who identified these items as being healthy. We think what nutritionists believe is「healthy」will help explain what American voters believe is「healthy.」That is, the percentage of nutritionists who believe a food item is healthy is the explanatory variable, and the percentage of American voters who believe a food item is healthy is the response variable. We want to see how the percentage of American voters who identify food items as healthy changes as the percentage of nutritionists who label these items as healthy changes, so we put the percentage of agreement among nutritionists (the explanatory variable) on the horizontal axis. Each point on the plot represents one food item. We can see, for several of the food items, that as the percentage of agreement among nutritionists goes up, the percentage of agreement among American voters also goes up. We can also see that there isn’t always agreement among nutritionists and American voters. For example, items such as frozen yogurt, granola, granola bars, and coconut oil were rated more often as healthy by American voters than by nutrition experts. Conversely, items like sushi, quinoa, and tofu were rated more often as healthy by nutrition experts than by American voters.

Figure 14.2 Scatterplot of percentage of American voters who think certain foods are healthy against percentage of nutritionists who think certain foods are healthy, Example 1.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 0 to 100 in increments of 20 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 0 to 100 in increments of 20 units. Each point on the scatterplot represents one food item. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows. A point which represents Soda corresponds to (1, 10); a point which represents French fries corresponds to (2, 15); a point which represents Chocolate chip cookie corresponds to (4, 10); a point which represents Frozen yogurt corresponds to (30, 62); a point which represents Granola bar corresponds to (24, 70); a point which represents Coconut oil corresponds to (37, 70); a point which represents Granola corresponds to (48, 80); a point which represents Sushi corresponds to (74, 48); a point which represents Tofu corresponds to (84, 58); a point which represents Chicken corresponds to (90, 80); a point which represents Quinoa corresponds to (90, 60); a point which represents Apples corresponds to (98, 98); a point which represents Carrots corresponds to (92, 85).

Key Terms

A scatterplot shows the relationship between two quantitative variables measured on the same individuals. The values of one variable appear on the horizontal axis, and the values of the other variable appear on the vertical axis. Each individual in the data appears as the point in the plot fixed by the values of both variables for that individual.

Always plot the explanatory variable, if there is one, on the horizontal axis (the axis) of a scatterplot. As a reminder, we usually call the explanatory variable and the response variable . If there is no explanatory-response distinction, either variable can go on the horizontal axis.

Example 2

Health and wealth

Figure 14.3 is a scatterplot of data from the World Bank for 2016. The individuals are all the world’s nations for which data are available. The explanatory variable is a measure of how rich a country is: the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. GDP is the total value of the goods and services produced in a country, converted into dollars. The response variable is life expectancy at birth.

Figure 14.3 Scatterplot of the life expectancy of people in many nations against each nation’s gross domestic product per person, for Example 2.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 0 to 180,000 in increments of 20,000 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 50 to 85 in increments of 5 units. The data given in the scatter plot are as follows:

Most of the points are densely scattered as a vertical band from (0, 52) to (0, 80); slightly widening on the top from (0, 80) to (20000, 80). Text at the top reads, Costa Rica. A point which corresponds to (10000, 57) reads, Equatorial Guinea. A point which corresponds to (60000, 75) represents U.S., and another point which corresponds to (160000, 62) represents Liechtenstein.

We might expect people in richer countries to live longer. The overall pattern of the scatterplot does show this, but the relationship has an interesting shape. Life expectancy tends to rise very quickly as GDP increases, then levels off. People in very rich countries such as the United States typically live no longer than people in poorer but not extremely poor nations. Some of these countries, such as Costa Rica, do just about as well as the United States.

Two nations are outliers. In one, Equatorial Guinea, life expectancies are similar to those of its neighbors but its GDP is higher. Equatorial Guinea produces oil. It may be that income from mineral exports goes mainly to a few people and so pulls up GDP per capita without much effect on either the income or the life expectancy of ordinary citizens. That is, GDP per person is a mean, and we know that mean income can be much higher than median income.

The other outlier is Liechtenstein, a tiny nation bordering Switzerland and Austria. Liechtenstein has a strong financial sector and is considered a tax haven.

Now it’s your turn

14.1 Brain size and intelligence. For centuries, people have associated intelligence with brain size. A recent study used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the brain size of several individuals. The IQ and brain size (in units of 10,000 pixels) of six individuals are as follows:

Brain size: 100 90 95 92 88 106

IQ: 140 90 100 135 80 103

Is there an explanatory variable and a response variable? If so, what are they? Make a scatterplot of these data.

Interpreting Scatterplots

To interpret a scatterplot, apply the usual strategies of data analysis.

Key Terms

Two variables are positively associated when above-average values of one tend to accompany above-average values of the other and below-average values also tend to occur together. The scatterplot slopes upward as we move from left to right.

Two variables are negatively associated when above-average values of one tend to accompany below-average values of the other, and vice versa. The scatterplot slopes downward from left to right.

Both Figures 14.2 and 14.3 have a clear direction: the percentage of American voters who think certain foods are healthy goes up as the percentage of nutritionists who think those foods are healthy goes up, and life expectancy generally goes up as GDP increases. We say that Figures 14.2 and 14.3 show a positive association. Figure 14.4 is a scatterplot of the gas mileages (in miles per gallon) and vehicle weights (in pounds) of 396 model-year 2017 cars. The response variable is gas mileage and the explanatory variable is vehicle weight. We see that gas mileage decreases as vehicle weight increases. We say that Figure 14.4 shows a negative association.

Figure 14.4 Scatterplot of miles per gallon against weight for 396 cars.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 2000 to 6000 in increments of 1000 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 10 to 40 in increments of 5 units. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows: The majority of points are densely scattered in the region within the points (2010, 12), (2010, 37), (5000, 37), and (5000, 12). These points are more like a diagonal band with a downward slope starting from the top left portion to the bottom right portion of the graph. Other points correspond to (5300, 15), (5400, 12), (5500, 12) and (5600, 12).

Examining a scatterplot

In any graph of data, look for the overall pattern and for striking deviations from that pattern.

You can describe the overall pattern of a scatterplot by the direction, form, and strength of the relationship.

An important kind of deviation is an outlier, an individual value that falls outside the overall pattern of the relationship.

Statistics in Your World

After you plot your data, think! Abraham Wald (1902–1950), like many statisticians, worked on war problems during World War II. Wald invented some statistical methods that were military secrets until the war ended. Here is one of his simpler ideas. Asked where extra armor should be added to airplanes, Wald studied the location of enemy bullet holes in planes returning from combat. He plotted the locations on an outline of the plane. As data accumulated, most of the outline filled up. Put the armor in the few spots with no bullet holes, said Wald. That’s where bullets hit the planes that didn’t make it back.

Each of our scatterplots has a distinctive form. Figures 14.2 and 14.4 show a roughly straight-line trend, and Figure 14.3 shows a curved relationship. The strength of a relationship in a scatterplot is determined by how closely the points follow a clear form. The relationships in Figures 14.2 and 14.3 are not strong. American voters and nutrition experts are not always in agreement about which foods are healthy, and nations with similar GDPs can have quite different life expectancies. The relationship in Figure 14.4 is moderately strong. Here is an example of a stronger relationship with a simple form.

Example 3

Classifying fossils

Archaeopteryx is an extinct beast having feathers like a bird but teeth and a long bony tail like a reptile. Only six fossil specimens are known. Because these fossils differ greatly in size, some scientists think they are different species rather than individuals from the same species. We will examine data on the lengths in centimeters of the femur (a leg bone) and the humerus (a bone in the upper arm) for the five fossils that preserve both bones. Here are the data:

Femur: 38 56 59 64 74

Humerus: 41 63 70 72 84

Because there is no explanatory-response distinction, we can put either measurement on the axis of a scatterplot. The plot appears in Figure 14.5.

Figure 14.5 Scatterplot of the lengths of two bones in five fossil specimens of the extinct beast archaeopteryx, Example 3.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 30 to 90 in increments of 10 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 30 to 90 in increments of 10 units Five points in the graph correspond to (39, 41), (59, 62), (61, 72), (65, 75), (75, 85).

The plot shows a strong, positive, straight-line association. The straight-line form is important because it is common and simple. The association is strong because the points lie close to a line. It is positive because as the length of one bone increases, so does the length of the other bone. These data suggest that all five fossils belong to the same species and differ in size because some are younger than others. We might expect that a different species would have a different relationship between the lengths of the two bones, so that it would appear as an outlier.

Now it’s your turn

14.2 Brain size and intelligence. For centuries, people have associated intelligence with brain size. A recent study used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the brain size of several individuals. The IQ and brain size (in units of 10,000 pixels) of six individuals are as follows:

Brain size: 100 90 95 92 88 106

IQ: 140 90 100 135 80 103

Look carefully at the scatterplot you made of these data when you completed Exercise 14.1. What is the form, direction, and strength of the association? Are there any outliers?

This might be a good place to read the「What’s the verdict?」story on page 341, and to answer the questions. These questions ask you to explore a scatterplot of exam scores in a statistics class.

Multiple Variables

Relationships between variables can be complicated, and, often, a single response can be explained not just by one explanatory variable but by a combination of explanatory variables. In addition to showing the relationship between two variables, a scatterplot can allow us to see how three or more variables are related. Recall Figure 14.4 where car weight was shown to have a negative association with gas mileage. What happens when we take the effect of a third variable into account, such as the number of cylinders in the car? Cylinders are the power units in a car’s engine, and the number of cylinders is generally related to the size of the engine. There is a negative relationship between the weight of a vehicle and the gas mileage of the vehicle, but Figure 14.6 shows how this relationship is suddenly not as straightforward when we account for the number of cylinders in the vehicle. For instance, the relationship appears negative for vehicles with six or fewer cylinders but is either nonexistent or slightly positive for vehicles with eight or more cylinders.

Figure 14.6 Scatterplot of miles per gallon against weight for 396 cars. Symbols show what happens when number of cylinders is taken into account.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 2000 to 6000 in increments of 1000 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 10 to 40 in increments of 5 units. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows:

Cylinders that represent 4 pounds are densely scattered between the points (2010, 22), (2010, 37), (4010, 37), and (4010, 22).

Cylinders that represent 6 pounds are densely scattered between the points (3000, 20), (3000, 25), (4500, 25), and (4500, 20).

Cylinders that represent 8 pounds are densely scattered between the points (2010, 37), (3200, 25), (4900, 25), and (4900, 15).

Cylinders that represent 3 pounds are less densely scattered between the points (2010, 38), (2010, 36), (2010, 34), and (4900, 15).

Cylinders that represent 12 pounds are less densely scattered between the points (5100, 15), (5900, 15), (5900, 12), and (5100, 12).

More examples that illustrate the interplay among multiple variables can be found on the Gapminder website (http://www.gapminder.org/tools), where data are compiled from a variety of different sources. Figure 14.7 is a scatterplot from Gapminder that displays the relationship between fertility rate (or the average number of babies born per woman) and life expectancy (in years) for many countries around the world in 2014. The individuals are countries. Each dot in the scatterplot represents a different country. The size of the dot relates to the population size of the country, with larger dots representing more populated countries. The color of the dot refers to the region of the world in which the country is located. From an examination of this scatterplot, we can see an overall negative relationship; as fertility rate goes up, life expectancy goes down. Both larger and smaller countries vary in terms of fertility rate and life expectancy, but patterns clearly emerge when countries are categorized based on population size and region of the country. For example, the scatterplot allows us to see that the most populated countries have among the lowest fertility rates, but their life expectancies are not always higher when compared to less-populated countries. We can also see a striking difference in both fertility rate and life expectancy for countries in different regions of the world; the highest fertility rates and lowest life expectancies come from countries in Africa, as denoted by the blue dots, and the lowest fertility rates and highest life expectancies come from countries in Europe, as denoted by the yellow dots. Scatterplots can be manipulated on the Gapminder website to display relationships among many different variables, and each scatterplot includes a「play」button that can allow the user to see how relationships among these variables have changed over time.

Figure 14.7 Scatterplot from gapminder.org of life expectancy against fertility rate for many countries. Dot size and color provide information about population size and region of the world, respectively.

The graph plots Babies per woman ranging from 1 to 8 along the horizontal axis and life expectancy ranging from 10 to 80 years along the vertical axis. The life expectancy of most of the babies runs closer to 70 and 80 years when the number of babies per woman is 1. The life expectancy of most of the babies runs closer to 60 and 70 years when the number of babies per woman is 2 with some of the babies making it to 80. The life expectancy of some of the babies ranges from 50 to 70 years when the number of babies per woman is 4, 5, or 6. A few babies make it to 70 years when the number of babies per woman is 7 or 8.

Correlation

Key Terms

The correlation describes the direction and strength of a straight-line relationship between two quantitative variables. Correlation is usually written as .

A scatterplot displays the direction, form, and strength of the relationship between two quantitative variables. Straight-line relations are particularly important because a straight line is a simple pattern that is quite common. A straight-line relation is strong if the points lie close to a straight line and weak if they are widely scattered about a line. Our eyes are not good judges of how strong a relationship is. The two scatterplots in Figure 14.8 depict the same data, but the right-hand plot is drawn smaller in a large field. The right-hand plot seems to show a stronger straight-line relationship. Our eyes can be fooled by changing the plotting scales or the amount of blank space around the cloud of points in a scatterplot. We need to follow our strategy for data analysis by using a numerical measure to supplement the graph. Correlation is the measure we use.

Figure 14.8 Two scatterplots of the same data. The right-hand plot suggests a stronger relationship between the variables because of the surrounding space.

The first scatterplot shows points randomly scattered through the graph. The horizontal axis has values ranging from 30 to 80 in increments of 10 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 30 to 80 in increments of 10 units. Most of the points are irregularly scattered through the points (40, 30), (40, 45), (51, 50), (50, 60) (70, 70), and (70, 45). The data given is approximate.

The second scatterplot shows points densely scattered at the center of the graph. The horizontal axis has values ranging from 0 to 120 in increments of 10 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 0 to 120 in increments of 10 units. Most of the points are concentrated at the center points (40, 30), (50, 40), (55, 45), (58, 50), (60, 60), (70, 60), (65, 70). The data given is approximate.

Calculating a correlation takes a bit of work. You can usually think of as the result of pushing a calculator button or giving a command in software and concentrate on understanding its properties and use. Knowing how we obtain from data, however, does help us understand how correlation works, so here we go.

Example 4

Calculating correlation

We have data on two variables, and for individuals. For the fossil data in Example 3, is femur length, is humerus length, and we have data for fossils.

Step 1. Find the mean and standard deviation for both and For the fossil data, a calculator tells us that

Femur: cm cm

Humerus: cm cm

We use and to remind ourselves that there are two standard deviations, one for the values of and the other for the values of .

Step 2. Using the means and standard deviations from Step 1, find the standard scores for each -value and for each -value:

Step 3. The correlation is the average of the products of these standard scores. As with the standard deviation, we「average」by dividing by one fewer than the number of individuals:

The algebraic shorthand for the set of calculations in Example 4 is

The symbol called「sigma,」means「add them all up.」

Understanding Correlation

More important than calculating (a task for technology) is understanding how correlation measures association. Here are the facts:

Positive r indicates positive association between the variables, and negative r indicates negative association. The scatterplot in Figure 14.5 shows strong positive association between femur length and humerus length. In three fossils, both bones are longer than their average values, so their standard scores are positive for both and . In the other two fossils, the bones are shorter than their averages, so both standard scores are negative. The products are all positive, giving a positive .

The correlation r always falls between −1 and 1. Values of near 0 indicate a very weak straight-line relationship. The strength of the relationship increases as moves away from 0 toward either −1 or 1. Values of close to −1 or 1 indicate that the points lie close to a straight line. The extreme values and occur only when the points in a scatterplot lie exactly along a straight line. The result in Example 4 reflects the strong positive straight-line pattern in Figure 14.5. The scatterplots in Figure 14.9 illustrate how measures both the direction and the strength of a straight-line relationship. Study them carefully. Note that the sign of matches the direction of the slope in each plot, and that approaches −1 or 1 as the pattern of the plot comes closer to a straight line.

Because uses the standard scores for the observations, the correlation does not change when we change the units of measurement of or both. Measuring length in inches rather than centimeters in Example 4 would not change the correlation Our descriptive measures for one variable all share the same units as the original observations. If we measure length in centimeters, the median, quartiles, mean, and standard deviation are all in centimeters. The correlation between two variables, however, has no unit of measurement; it is just a number between −1 and 1.

Correlation ignores the distinction between explanatory and response variables. If we reverse our choice of which variable to call and which to call the correlation does not change.

Correlation measures the strength of only straight-line association between two variables. Correlation does not describe curved relationships between variables, no matter how strong they are.

Like the mean and standard deviation, the correlation is strongly affected by a few outlying observations. Use with caution when outliers appear in the scatterplot. Look, for example, at Figure 14.10. We changed the femur length of the first fossil from 38 to 60 centimeters. Rather than falling in line with the other fossils, the first is now an outlier. The correlation drops from for the original data to

Figure 14.9 How correlation measures the strength of a straight-line relationship. Patterns closer to a straight line have correlations closer to 1 or −1.

The scatterplot which shows the value of correlation r equals 0 has points scattered all around the region, getting slightly dense in the center.

The scatterplot which shows the value of correlation r equals negative 0.3 has points scattered randomly with no particular density in any part of the region.

The scatterplot which shows the value of correlation r equals 0.5 has points scattered like a diagonal band with an upward slope from the bottom left to the top right of the plot.

The scatterplot which shows the value of correlation r equals negative 0.7 has points scattered like a diagonal band with a downward slope from the top right to the bottom left of the plot.

The scatterplot which shows the value of correlation r equals 0.9 has points scattered almost like a diagonal line with an upward slope from the bottom left to the top right of the plot.

The scatterplot which shows the value of correlation r equals negative 0.99 has points scattered almost like a diagonal line with a downward slope from the top right to the bottom left of the plot.

Figure 14.10 Moving one point reduces the correlation from to

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 30 to 90 in increments of 10 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 30 to 90 in increments of 10 units. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows:

A dotted arrow points to a point (60, 42). Few other points in the graph are scattered across the points (55, 63), (60, 72), (65, 72), (75, 85).

Now it’s your turn

14.3 Brain size and intelligence. For centuries, people have associated intelligence with brain size. A recent study used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the brain size of several individuals. The IQ and brain size (in units of 10,000 pixels) of six individuals are as follows:

Brain size: 100 90 95 92 88 106

IQ: 140 90 100 135 80 103

Review the scatterplot you made of this data when you completed Exercise 14.1. Compare your plot with those in Figure 14.8. What would you estimate the correlation to be?

There are many kinds of relationships between variables and many ways to measure them. Although correlation is very common, remember its limitations. Correlation makes sense only for quantitative variables—we can speak of the relationship between the sex of voters and the political party they prefer, but not of the correlation between these variables. Even for quantitative variables such as the length of bones, correlation measures only straight-line association.

Remember also that correlation is not a complete description of two-variable data, even when there is a straight-line relationship between the variables. You should give the means and standard deviations of both and along with the correlation. Because the formula for correlation uses the means and standard deviations, these measures are the proper choice to accompany a correlation.

Chapter 14 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 14: Statistics in Summary

A scatterplot is a graph of the relationship between two quantitative variables. If you have an explanatory and a response variable, put the explanatory variable on the (horizontal) axis of the scatterplot.

When you examine a scatterplot, look for the direction, form, and strength of the relationship and also for possible outliers.

If there is a clear direction, is it positive (the scatterplot slopes upward from left to right) or negative (the plot slopes downward)?

Is the form straight or curved? Are there clusters of observations? Is the relationship strong (a tight pattern in the plot) or weak (the points scatter widely)?

How might our description of the relationship change if multiple variables are taken into account?

The correlation r measures the direction and strength of a straight-line relationship between two quantitative variables.

Correlation is a number between −1 and 1. The sign of shows whether the association is positive or negative. The value of gets closer to −1 or 1 as the points cluster more tightly about a straight line. The extreme values −1 and 1 occur only when the scatterplot shows a perfectly straight line.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

Chapters 11, 12, and 13 discussed graphical and numerical summaries suitable for a single quantitative variable. In practice, most statistical studies examine relationships between two or more variables. In this chapter, we learn about scatterplots, a type of graph that displays the relationship between two quantitative variables, and correlation, a number that measures the direction and strength of a straight-line relationship between two quantitative variables.

As with other graphics and numbers that summarize data, scatterplots and correlations help us see what the data are telling us, in this case about the possible relationship between two quantitative variables. The goal is to draw conclusions about whether the relationships observed in our data are true in general. In the next chapter, we discuss this in detail.

Case Study Evaluated

Use what you have learned in this chapter to evaluate the Case Study that opened the chapter. Start by reviewing the Chapter Summary. Then answer each of the following questions in complete sentences. Be sure to communicate clearly enough for any of your classmates to understand what you are saying.

Figure 14.11 is a scatterplot of each state’s average SAT Mathematics score and the proportion of that state’s high school seniors who took the SAT exam. SAT score is the response variable, and the proportion of a state’s high school seniors who took the SAT exam is the explanatory variable.

Describe the overall pattern in words. Is the association positive or negative? Is the relationship strong?

The plot shows two groups of states. In one group, fewer than 20% took the SAT. In the other, at least 26% took the exam and the average scores tend to be lower. There are two common college entrance exams, the SAT and the ACT. In ACT states, only students applying to selective colleges take the SAT. Which group of states in the plot corresponds to states in which most students take the ACT exam?

Write a paragraph, in language that someone who knows no statistics would understand, explaining why comparing states on the basis of average SAT scores alone would be misleading as a way of comparing the quality of education in the states.

Figure 14.11 Scatterplot of average SAT Mathematics score for each state against the proportion of the state’s high school seniors who took the SAT.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 0 to 100 in increments of 20 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 450 to 650 in increments of 50 units. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows.

Most of the points are densely scattered in the region within the coordinates (0, 520), (0, 652), (16, 652), (16, 520). Few other points are scattered in the region within the coordinates (35, 500), (35, 570), (70, 570), (70, 500). Points are scarce in the region between (90, 470), (90, 525), (105, 525), (90, 470).

The data given is approximate.

14.10 Measuring mice. For a biology project, you measure the tail length (millimeters) and weight (grams) of 10 mice.

Explain why you expect the correlation between tail length and weight to be positive.

If you measured tail length in centimeters rather than millimeters, would you expect the correlation to change? Please explain.

14.11 Living on campus. A February 2, 2008, article in the Columbus Dispatch reported a study on the distances students lived from campus and average grade point average (GPA). Here is a summary of the results:

Residence Avg. GPA

Residence hall 3.33

Walking distance 3.16

Near campus, long walk or short drive 3.12

Within the county, not near campus 2.97

Outside the county 2.94

Based on these data, is the association between the distance a student lives from campus and average GPA positive, negative, or near 0?

14.12 The endangered manatee. Manatees are large, gentle, slow-moving creatures found along the coast of Florida. Many manatees are injured or killed by boats. Figure 14.12 is a scatterplot of the number of manatee deaths by boats versus the number of boats registered in Florida (in thousands) for the years between 1977 and 2016.

Describe the overall pattern of the relationship in words.

About what are the number of boats registered and manatee deaths for point A?

Suppose there was a point near B. Would this be an outlier. If so, say how it is unusual (for example,「a moderately high number of deaths but a low number of boats registered」).

Figure 14.12 Manatee deaths by boats and boats registered in Florida, Exercise 14.12.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 400 to 1100 in increments of 100 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 0 to 100 in increments of 20 units. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows: The points are scattered through the graph in a diagonal fashion, starting from (450, 10) and sloping upward to (1500, 100). Most of the points are densely scattered in the region within the coordinates (850, 70), (850, 110), (1050, 110), (1050, 70). Point A (850, 70) and point B (1050, 40) are marked on the scatterplot. The data given is approximate.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 100 to 200 in increments of 20 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 100 to 600 in increments of 100 units. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows:

A point A corresponds to (105, 150). 8 points are scattered within the coordinates (130, 320), (130, 440), (155, 440), and (155, 320), that lies in the center of the plot. 7 other points are scattered within the coordinates (170, 390), (170, 550), (190, 550) and (190, 390)

14.18 Long eyelashes. False eyelashes are sometimes worn in an effort to extend the length of an individual’s natural eyelashes. Research suggests, however, that our natural eyelash length is proportional to the width of our eye. To better understand how eye width length (in centimeters, or cm) is related to eyelash length (in centimeters, or cm), measurements were obtained from 22 mammals. Those measurements are presented here.

Make a scatterplot. (Which variable should be the explanatory variable?)

Is the association between these variables positive or negative? Explain why you expect the relationship to have this direction.

Describe the form and strength of the relationship.

14.19 Death by intent. Homicide and suicide are both intentional means of ending a life. However, the reason for committing a homicide is different than that for suicide, and we might expect homicide and suicide rates to be uncorrelated. On the other hand, both can involve some degree of violence, so perhaps we might expect some level of correlation in the rates. Table 14.1 gives data from 2008–2010 for 26 counties in Ohio. Rates are per 100,000 people. The data also indicate that the homicide rates for some counties should be treated with caution because of low counts (Y = Yes, treat with caution, and N = No, do not treat with caution).

Does it matter in this example which variable is considered to be the explanatory variable and which variable is considered to be the response variable? Please explain.

Make a scatterplot of the data for the counties for which the data do not need to be treated with caution.

Is the association between these variables positive or negative? What is the form of the relationship? How strong is the relationship?

Now add the data for the counties for which the data do need to be treated with caution to your graph, using a different color or a different plotting symbol. Does the pattern of the relationship that you observed in part (c) hold for the counties for which the data do need to be treated with caution also?

14.20 Marriage. Suppose that men always married women three years younger than themselves. Draw a scatterplot of the ages of six married couples, with the husband’s age as the explanatory variable. What is the correlation for your data? Why?

14.21 Stretching a scatterplot. Changing the units of measurement can greatly alter the appearance of a scatterplot. Return to the fossil data from Example 3:

Femur: 38 56 59 64 74

Humerus: 41 63 70 72 84

These measurements are in centimeters. Suppose a deranged scientist measured the femur in meters and the humerus in millimeters. The data would then be

Femur: 0.38 0.56 0.59 0.64 0.74

Humerus: 410 630 700 720 840

Draw an axis extending from 0 to 75 and a axis extending from 0 to 850. Plot the original data on these axes. Then plot the new data on the same axes in a different color. The two plots look very different.

Nonetheless, the correlation is exactly the same for the two sets of measurements. Why do you know that this is true without doing any calculations?

14.22 Long eyelashes. Exercise 14.18 gives data on the eye width and eyelash length for a sample of 22 mammals.

Use a calculator to find the correlation . Explain from looking at the scatterplot why this value of is reasonable.

Suppose that the eye widths had been recorded in inches rather than centimeters. For example, the eye width of the giraffe would be 1.61 inches rather than 4.08 centimeters. How would the value of change?

14.23 Death by intent. Table 14.1 gives data on on homicide and suicide rates from 2008–2010 for 26 counties in Ohio. The homicide rates for 14 of the counties should be treated with caution because of low counts. You made a scatterplot of these data in Exercise 14.19.

Do you think the correlation will be about the same for the counties for which the data do need to be treated with caution and for the counties for which the data do not need to be treated with caution, or quite different for the two groups? Why?

Calculate for the counties for which the data do need to be treated with caution alone and also for the counties for which the data do not need to be treated with caution alone. (Use your calculator.)

14.24 Strong association but no correlation. The gas mileage of an automobile first increases and then decreases as the speed increases. Suppose that this relationship is very regular, as shown by the following data on speed (miles per hour) and mileage (miles per gallon):

Speed: 25 35 45 55 65

Mileage: 20 24 26 24 20

Make a scatterplot of mileage versus speed. Use a calculator to show that the correlation between speed and mileage is Explain why the correlation is 0 even though there is a strong relationship between speed and mileage.

14.25 Death by intent. The data in Table 14.1 are given in deaths per 100,000 people. If we changed the data from deaths per 100,000 people to deaths per 1,000 people, how would the rates change? How would the correlation between homicide and suicide rates change?

14.26 What are the units? How sensitive to changes in water temperature are coral reefs? To find out, measure the growth of corals in aquariums (where growth is the change in weight, in pounds, of the coral before and after the experiment) when the water temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) is controlled at different levels. In what units are each of the following descriptive statistics measured?

The mean growth of the coral

The standard deviation of the growth of the coral

The correlation between weight gain and temperature

The median growth of the coral

14.27 Teaching and research. A college newspaper interviews a psychologist about student ratings of the teaching of faculty members. The psychologist says,「The evidence indicates that the correlation between the research productivity and teaching rating of faculty members is close to zero.」The paper reports this as「Professor McDaniel said that good researchers tend to be poor teachers, and vice versa.」Explain why the paper’s report is wrong. Write a statement in plain language (don’t use the word「correlation」) to explain the psychologist’s meaning.

14.28 Sloppy writing about correlation. Each of the following statements contains a blunder. Explain in each case what is wrong.

「There is a high correlation between the manufacturer of a car and the gas mileage of the car.」

「We found a high correlation between the horsepower of a car and the gas mileage of the car.」

「The correlation between the weight of a car and the gas mileage of the car was found to be mile per gallon.」

14.29 Guess the correlation. Measurements in large samples show that the correlation

between this semester’s GPA and the previous semester’s GPA of an upper-class student is about .

between IQ and the scores on a test of the reading ability of seventh-grade students is about .

between the number of hours a student spends studying per week and the average number of hours spent studying by his or her roommates is about .

The answers (in scrambled order) are

Match the answers to the statements and explain your choice.

14.30 Guess the correlation. For each of the following pairs of variables, would you expect a substantial negative correlation, a substantial positive correlation, or a weak correlation?

The cost of a cable TV service and the number of channels provided by the service.

The weight of a road-racing bicycle and the cost of the bicycle.

The number of hours a student spends on Facebook and the student’s GPA.

The heights and salaries of faculty members at your university.

14.31 Investment diversification. A mutual funds company’s newsletter says,「A well-diversified portfolio includes assets with low correlations.」The newsletter includes a table of correlations between the returns on various classes of investments. For example, the correlation between municipal bonds and large-cap stocks is 0.50, and the correlation between municipal bonds and small-cap stocks is 0.21.

Rachel invests heavily in municipal bonds. She wants to diversify by adding an investment whose returns do not closely follow the returns on her bonds. Should she choose large-cap stocks or small-cap stocks for this purpose? Explain your answer.

If Rachel wants an investment that tends to increase when the return on her bonds drops, what kind of correlation should she look for?

14.32 Take me out to the ball game. What is the relationship between the price charged for a hot dog and the price charged, per ounce, for beer in Major League Baseball stadiums? Table 14.2 gives some data. Make a scatterplot appropriate for showing how beer price helps explain hot dog price. Describe the relationship that you see. Are there any outliers?

14.33 When it rains, it pours. Figure 14.14 plots the highest yearly precipitation ever recorded in each state, as of 2010, against the highest daily precipitation ever recorded in that state. The points for Alaska (AK), Hawaii (HI), and Texas (TX) are marked on the scatterplot.

About what are the highest daily and yearly precipitation values for Alaska?

Alaska and Hawaii have very high yearly maximums relative to their daily maximums. Omit these two states as outliers. Describe the nature of the relationship for the other states. Would knowing a state’s highest daily precipitation be a great help in predicting that state’s highest yearly precipitation?

Figure 14.14 Record-high yearly precipitation recorded at any weather station in each state plotted against record-high daily precipitation for the state, Exercise 14.33.

The horizontal axis has values ranging from 0 to 50 in increments of 10 units and the vertical axis has values ranging from 100 to 700 in increments of 100 units. The data given in the scatterplot are as follows:

Most of the points are densely scattered in the region within the coordinates (5, 10), (5, 150), (25, 150), (25, 10). A point A K corresponds to (15, 320); a point H I corresponds to (37, 700) and a point T X corresponds to (43, 120).

14.34 How many corn plants are too many? How much corn per acre should a farmer plant to obtain the highest yield? To find the best planting rate, do an experiment: plant at different rates on several plots of ground and measure the harvest. Here are data from such an experiment:

Plants per acre Yield (bushels per acre)

12,000 150.1 113.0 118.4 142.6

16,000 166.9 120.7 135.2 149.8

20,000 165.3 130.1 139.6 149.9

24,000 134.7 138.4 156.1

28,000 119.0 150.5

Is yield or planting rate the explanatory variable? Why?

Make a scatterplot of yield and planting rate.

Describe the overall pattern of the relationship. Is it a straight line? Is there a positive or negative association, or neither? Explain why increasing the number of plants per acre of ground has the effect that your graph shows.

14.35 Why so small? Make a scatterplot of the following data:

1 2 3 4 9 10

12 2 3 5 9 11

Use your calculator to show that the correlation is about 0.4. What feature of the data is responsible for reducing the correlation to this value despite a strong straight-line association between and in most of the observations?

14.36 Ecological correlation. Many studies reveal a positive correlation between income and number of years of education. To investigate this, a researcher makes two plots.

Plot 1: Plot the number of years of education (the explanatory variable) versus the average annual income of all adults having that many years of education (the response variable).

Plot 2: Plot the number of years of education (the explanatory variable) versus the individual annual incomes of all adults (the response variable).

Which plot will display a stronger correlation? (Hint: Which plot will display a greater amount of scatter? In particular, will the variation from individual to individual having the same number of years of education create more or less scatter in Plot 2 compared with plotting the average incomes in Plot 1? What effect will increased scatter have on the strength of the association we observe?)

Note: A correlation based on averages rather than on individuals is called an ecological correlation. Correlations based on averages can be misleading if they are interpreted to be about individuals.

14.37 Ecological correlation again. In Exercise 14.11 (page 333), would the association be stronger, weaker, or the same if the data given listed the GPAs of individual students (rather than averages) and the distance they lived from campus?
