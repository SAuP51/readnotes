During the lunch break, a reporter from a local TV station asked me what I thought about the low temperature readings. I said it seemed to me that the liquid hydrogen and oxygen had chilled the 22-degree air even further as it flowed down the big fuel tank onto the rocket booster. For some reason, the reporter thought I had just told him some important, secret information, so he didn’t use my name in his report that evening. Instead, he said,「This explanation comes from a Nobel Prize winner, so it must be right.」

In the afternoon, the telemetering people gave us all kinds of information on the last moments of the shuttle. Hundreds of things had been measured, all of which indicated that everything was working as well as it could under the circumstances: the pressure in the hydrogen tank suddenly fell a few seconds after the flame had been observed; the gyros which steer the shuttle were working perfectly until one had to work harder than the other because there were side forces from the flame shooting out of the side of the booster rocket; the main engines even shut themselves down when the hydrogen tank exploded, because there was a pressure drop in the fuel lines.

That meeting lasted until 7:30 in the evening, so we postponed the tour until Friday and went straight to a dinner set up by Mr. Rogers.

At the dinner I happened to be seated next to Al Keel, who had joined the commission on Monday as its executive officer to help Mr. Rogers organize and run our work. He came to us from the White House—from something called the OMB*—and had a good reputation for doing a fine job at this and that. Mr. Rogers kept saying how lucky we were to get somebody with such high qualifications.

One thing that impressed me, though, was that Dr. Keel had a Ph.D. in aerospace, and had done some post-doc work at Berkeley. When he introduced himself on Monday, he joked that the last「honest work」he had done for a living was some aerodynamics work for the shuttle program ten or twelve years ago. So I felt very comfortable with him.

Well, I haven’t been talking to Dr. Keel for more than five minutes, when he tells me he’s never been so insulted in his life, that he didn’t take this job to be so insulted, and that he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore!

Now, I have a way of not remembering things when I do something dumb or annoying to people, so I forget what I said that put him out. Whatever it was, I thought I was joking, so I was very surprised by his reaction. I had undoubtedly said some boorish, brash, damn-fool thing, which I therefore can’t remember!

Then there was a rather tense period of five or ten minutes, with me apologizing and trying to get a conversation going again. We finally got to talking again, somewhat. We were not big friends, but at least there was peace.

On Friday morning, we had another public meeting, this time to hear people from Thiokol and NASA talk about the night before the launch. Everything came out so slowly: the witness doesn’t really want to tell you everything, so you have to get the answers out by asking exactly the right questions.

Other guys on the commission were completely awake—Mr. Sutter, for instance.「Exactly what were your quality criteria for acceptance under such-and-such and so-and-so?」—he’d ask specific questions like that, and it would turn out they didn’t have any such criteria. Mr. Covert and Mr. Walker were the same way. Everybody was asking good questions, but I was fogged out most of the time, feeling a little bit behind.

Then this business of Thiokol changing its position came up. Mr. Rogers and Dr. Ride were asking two Thiokol managers, Mr. Mason and Mr. Lund, how many people were against the launch, even at the last moment.

「We didn’t poll everyone,」says Mr. Mason.

「Was there a substantial number against the launch, or just one or two?」

「There were, I would say, probably five or six in engineering who at that point would have said it is not as conservative to go with that temperature, and we don’t know. The issue was we didn’t know for sure that it would work.」

「So it was evenly divided?」

「That’s a very estimated number.」

It struck me that the Thiokol managers were waffling. But I only knew how to ask simpleminded questions. So I said,「Could you tell me, sirs, the names of your four best seals experts, in order of ability?」

「Roger Boisjoly and Arnie Thompson are one and two. Then there’s Jack Kapp and, uh… Jerry Burns.」

I turned to Mr. Boisjoly, who was right there, at the meeting.「Mr. Boisjoly, were you in agreement that it was okay to fly?」

He says,「No, I was not.」

I ask Mr. Thompson, who was also there.

「No, I was not.」

I say,「Mr. Kapp?」

Mr. Lund says,「He is not here. I talked to him after the meeting, and he said, ‘I would have made that decision, given the information we had.’「

「And the fourth man?」

「Jerry Burns. I don’t know what his position was.」

「So,」I said,「of the four, we have one ‘don’t know,’ one ‘very likely yes,’ and the two who were mentioned right away as being the best seal experts, both said no.」So this「evenly split」stuff was a lot of crap. The guys who knew the most about the seals—what were they saying?

Late in the afternoon, we were shown around the Kennedy Space Center. It was interesting; it wasn’t as bad as I had predicted. The other commissioners asked a lot of important questions. We didn’t have time to see the booster-rocket assembly, but near the end we were going to see the wreckage that had been recovered so far. I was pretty tired of this group stuff, so I excused myself from the rest of the tour.

I ran down to Charlie Stevenson’s place to see more pictures of the launch. I also found out more about the unusually low temperature readings. The guys were very cooperative, and wanted me to work with them. I had been waiting for ten days to run around in one of these places, and here I was, at last!

At dinner that night, I said to Mr. Rogers,「I was thinking of staying here over the weekend.」

「Well, Dr. Feynman,」he said,「I’d prefer you come back to Washington with us tonight. But of course, you’re free to do whatever you want.」

「Well, then,」I said,「I’ll stay.」

On Saturday I talked to the guy who had actually taken the temperature readings the morning of the launch—a nice fella named B. K. Davis. Next to each temperature he had written the exact time he had measured it, and then took a picture of it. You could see large gaps between the times as he climbed up and down the big launch tower. He measured the temperature of the air, the rocket, the ground, the ice, and even a puddle of slush with antifreeze in it. He did a very complete job.

NASA had a theoretical calculation of how the temperatures should vary around the launch pad: they should have been more uniform, and higher. Somebody thought that heat radiating to the clear sky had something to do with it. But then someone else noticed that BK’s reading for the slush was much lower than the photograph indicated: at 8 degrees, the slush—even with antifreeze in it—should have been frozen solid.

Then we looked at the device the ice crew used for measuring the temperatures. I got the instruction manual out, and found that you’re supposed to put the instrument out in the environment for at least 20 minutes before using it. Mr. Davis said he had taken it out of the box—at 70 degrees—and began making measurements right away. Therefore we had to find out whether the errors were reproducible. In other words, could the circumstances be duplicated?

On Monday I called up the company that made the device, and talked to one of their technical guys:「Hi, my name is Dick Feynman,」I said.「I’m on the commission investigating the Challenger accident, and I have some questions about your infrared scanning gun…」

「May I call you right back?」he says.

「Sure.」

After a little while he calls me back:「I’m sorry, but it’s proprietary information. I can’t discuss it with you.」

By this time I realized what the real difficulty was: the company was scared green that we were going to blame the accident on their instrument. I said,「Sir, your scanning gun has nothing to do with the accident. It was used by the people here in a way that’s contrary to the procedures in your instruction manual, and I’m trying to figure out if we can reproduce the errors and determine what the temperatures really were that morning. To do this, I need to know more about your instrument.」

The guy finally came around, and became quite cooperative. With his help, I advised the ice-crew guys on an experiment. They cooled a room down to about 40 degrees, and put a big block of ice in it—with ice, you can be sure the surface temperature is 32 degrees. Then they brought in the scanning gun from a room which was 70 degrees inside, and made measurements of the ice block every 30 seconds. They were able to measure how far off the instrument was as a function of time.

Mr. Davis had written his measurements so carefully that it was very easy to fix all the numbers. And then, remarkably, the recalculated temperatures were close to what was expected according to the theoretical model. It looked very sensible.

The next time I talked to a reporter, I straightened everything out about the temperatures, and informed him that the earlier theory expounded by the Nobel Prize winner was wrong.

I wrote a report for the other commissioners on the temperature problem, and sent it to Dr. Keel.

Then I investigated something we were looking into as a possible contributing cause of the accident: when the booster rockets hit the ocean, they became out of round a little bit from the impact. At Kennedy they’re taken apart, and the sections—four for each rocket—are sent by rail to Thiokol in Utah, where they are packed with new propellant. Then they’re put back on a train to Florida. During transport, the sections (which are hauled on their side) get squashed a little bit—the softish propellant is very heavy. The total amount of squashing is only a fraction of an inch, but when you put the rocket sections back together, a small gap is enough to let hot gases through: the O-rings are only a quarter of an inch thick, and compressed only two-hundredths of an inch!

I thought I’d do some calculations. NASA gave me all the numbers on how far out of round the sections can get, so I tried to figure out how much the resulting squeeze was, and where it was located—maybe the minimum squeeze was where the leak occurred. The numbers were measurements taken along three diameters, every 60 degrees. But three matching diameters won’t guarantee that things will fit; six diameters, or any other number of diameters, won’t do, either.

For example, you can make a figure something like a triangle with rounded corners, in which three diameters, 60 degrees apart, have the same length.

I remembered seeing such a trick at a museum when I was a kid. There was a gear rack that moved back and forth perfectly smoothly, while underneath it were some noncircular, funny-looking, crazy-shaped gears turning on shafts that wobbled. It looked impossible, but the reason it worked was that the gears were shapes whose diameters were always the same.

So the numbers NASA gave me were useless.

During that weekend, just as I had predicted in my letter home, I kept getting notes from the commission headquarters in Washington:「Check the temperature readings, check the pictures, check this, check that…」—there was quite a list. But as the instructions came in, I had done most of them already.

One note had to do with a mysterious piece of paper. Someone at Kennedy had reportedly written「Let’s go for it」while assembling one of the solid booster rockets. Such language appeared to show a certain recklessness. My mission: find that piece of paper.

FIGURE 17. This figure has all its diameters the same length—yet it is obviously not round!

Well, by this time I understood how much paper there was in NASA. I was sure it was a trick to make me get lost, so I did nothing about it.

Instead, I pursued something surreptitiously.

It was rumored that the reason NASA tried to make the shuttle fly on January 28th, in spite of the cold, was that the president was going to give his State of the Union address that night. According to the theory, the White House had it all cooked up so that during the State of the Union address, the teacher, Mrs. McAuliffe, would talk to the president and Congress from space. It was gonna be great: the president would say,「Hello! How are you doing?」And she would say,「Fine」—something very dramatic.

Since it sounded logical, I began by supposing it was very likely possible. But was there any evidence? This kind of thing I didn’t know how to investigate. I could only think of this: it’s very hard to get through to the president; I also can’t just call up an astronaut and talk to her—if she’s in space. Therefore, switching the signals down from the shuttle over to the president while he’s talking to Congress must be a complicated business.

To find out whether anybody had set up to do that, I went down to the lowest levels and asked guys at the bottom some technical questions.

They showed me the antennas, they told me about the frequencies, they showed me the big radio system and the computer system; they showed me all the ways they did things.

I said,「If you had to send a transmission somewhere else—to Marshall, say—how would you do it?」

They said,「Oh, we’re just a relay station. Everything is automatically sent over to Houston, and they switch everything out from there. We don’t do any switching here.」

So I didn’t find any evidence—at least at Kennedy. But the guys there were so nice to me, and everything was so pleasant, that I feel bad. I don’t like to cheat people. It was a little sneaky, what I was doing. Nevertheless, I thought I’d better do the same thing when I got to Houston.

On Monday, Mr. Hotz came down to Florida to work with me. (He told me later that he had been sent down with specific instructions to see what I was doing, and to keep me from「going wild.」) Mr. Hotz brought a list of things to look into:「There are a lot of things on this list,」he said,「so I’d be happy to split the work with you.」Some things he said he could do more easily, and the rest of the things I had already done—except for that piece of paper which said「Let’s go for it.」Mr. Hotz hinted around that it might have come from the diary of someone in the booster-rocket assembly. That wasn’t enough of a clue for me; I just wasn’t gonna do it. Instead, I went to see a Mr. Lamberth, who had said he wanted to talk to me.

Mr. Lamberth was way up in the works, a big cheese in charge of assembling the solid-rocket boosters. He wanted to tell me about some problems he had.「The workers used to have much better discipline,」he explained,「but nowadays they’re not like they used to be.」He gave me a couple of examples.

The first incident had to do with taking the booster rockets apart after they had been recovered from the sea. The rocket sections are held together by 180 pins—each about an inch and a half in diameter and two inches long—all the way around.

There was some kind of procedure for taking sections apart, in which the workers were supposed to pull the rocket up a certain distance. They had gotten to paying attention only to the amount of force they were applying—about 11,000 pounds. That was a better method, from a physical standpoint, because the idea is to take the load off the pins.

One time the force gauge wasn’t working right. The workers kept putting more force on, wondering why they weren’t reaching 11,000 pounds, when all of a sudden one of the pins broke.

Mr. Lamberth reprimanded the workers for not following procedures. It reminded me of when I tried to make things work better at my aunt’s hotel: your method is better than the regular way, but then you have a little accident…*

The second story Mr. Lamberth told me had to do with putting the rocket sections together. The regular procedure was to stack one section on top of the other and match the upper section to the lower one.

If a section needed to be reshaped a little bit, the procedure was to first pick up the section with a crane and let it hang sideways a few days. It’s rather simpleminded.

If they couldn’t make a section round enough by the hanging method, there was another procedure: use the「rounding machine」—a rod with a hydraulic press on one end and a nut on the other—and increase the pressure.

Mr. Lamberth told me the pressure shouldn’t exceed 1200 pounds per square inch (psi). One time, a section wasn’t round enough at 1200 psi, so the workers took a wrench and began turning the nut on the other end. When they finally got the section round enough, the pressure was up to 1350.「This is another example of the lack of discipline among the workers,」Mr. Lamberth said.

I had wanted to talk with the assembly workers anyway (I love that kind of thing), so I arranged to see them the next day at 2:30 in the afternoon.

At 2:30 I walk into this room, and there’s a long table with thirty or forty people—they’re all sitting there with morose faces, very serious, ready to talk to The Commissioner.

I was terrified. I hadn’t realized my terrible power. I could see they were worried. They must have been told I was investigating the errors they had made!

So right away I said,「I had nothin’ to do, so I thought I’d come over and talk to the guys who put the rockets together. I didn’t want everybody to stop working just ‘cause I wanna find out something for my own curiosity; I only wanted to talk with the workers…」

Most of the people got up and left. Six or seven guys stayed—the crew who actually put the rocket sections together, their foreman, and some boss who was higher up in the system.

Well, these guys were still a little bit scared. They didn’t really want to open up. The first thing I think to say is,「I have a question: when you measure the three diameters and all the diameters match, do the sections really fit together? It seems to me that you could have some bumps on one side and some flat areas directly across, so the three diameters would match, but the sections wouldn’t fit.」

「Yes, yes!」they say.「We get bumps like that. We call them nipples.」

The only woman there said,「It’s got nothing to do with me!」—and everybody laughed.

「We get nipples all the time,」they continued.「We’ve been tryin’ to tell the supervisor about it, but we never get anywhere!」

We were talking details, and that works wonders. I would ask questions based on what could happen theoretically, but to them it looked like I was a regular guy who knew about their technical problems. They loosened up very rapidly, and told me all kinds of ideas they had to improve things.

For example, when they use the rounding machine, they have to put a rod through holes exactly opposite each other. There are 180 holes, so they have to make sure the other end of the rod goes through the hole 90 holes away. Now, it turns out you have to climb up into an awkward place to count the holes. It’s very slow and very difficult.

They thought it would be very helpful if there were four paint marks, 90 degrees apart, put on at the factory. That way, they would never have to count more than 22 holes to the nearest mark. For example, if they put the rod through a hole which is 9 holes clockwise from a paint mark, then the other end of the rod would go through the hole which is 9 holes clockwise from the opposite mark.

The foreman, Mr. Fichtel, said he wrote a memo with this suggestion to his superiors two years ago, but nothing had happened yet. When he asked why, he was told the suggestion was too expensive.

「Too expensive to paint four little lines?」I said in disbelief.

They all laughed.「It’s not the paint; it’s the paperwork,」Mr. Fichtel said.「They would have to revise all the manuals.」

The assembly workers had other observations and suggestions. They were concerned that if two rocket sections scrape as they’re being put together, metal filings could get into the rubber seals and damage them. They even had some suggestions for redesigning the seal. Those suggestions weren’t very good, but the point is, the workers were thinking! I got the impression that they were not undisciplined; they were very interested in what they were doing, but they weren’t being given much encouragement. Nobody was paying much attention to them. It was remarkable that their morale was as high as it was under the circumstances.

Then the workers began to talk to the boss who had stayed.「We’re disappointed by something,」one of them said.「When the commission was going to see the booster-rocket assembly, the demonstration was going to be done by the managers. Why wouldn’t you let us do it?」

「We were afraid you’d be frightened by the commissioners and you wouldn’t want to do it.」

「No, no,」said the workmen.「We think we do a good job, and we wanted to show what we do.」

After that meeting, the boss took me to the cafeteria. As we were eating—the workmen weren’t with us anymore—he said,「I was surprised they were so concerned about that.」

Later, I talked to Mr. Fichtel about this incident of increasing the pressure past 1200. He showed me the notes he made as he went along: they weren’t the formal papers that are stamped; they were part of an informal but carefully written diary.

I said,「I hear the pressure got up to 1350.」

「Yes,」he said,「we had tightened the nut at the other end.」

「Was that the regular procedure?」

「Oh, yes,」he said,「it’s in the book.」

He opens up the manual and shows me the procedure. It says,「Build up the pressure on the hydraulic jack. If this is insufficient to obtain desired roundness, then very carefully tighten nut on other end to get to the desired roundness」—it said so in black and white! It didn’t say that tightening the nut would increase the pressure past 1200 psi; the people who wrote the manual probably weren’t quite aware of that.

Mr. Fichtel had written in his diary,「We very carefully tightened the nut」—exactly the same language as the instructions.

I said,「Mr. Lamberth told me he admonished you about going above 1200.」

「He never admonished me about that—why should he?」

We figured out what probably happened. Mr. Lamberth’s admonishment went down through the levels until somebody in middle management realized that Mr. Fichtel had gone by the book, and that the error was in the manual. But instead of telling Mr. Lamberth about the error, they simply threw away the admonishment, and just kept quiet.

Over lunch, Mr. Fichtel told me about the inspection procedures.「There’s a sheet for each procedure, like this one for the rounding procedure,」he said.「On it there are boxes for stamps—one from the supervisor, one from quality control, one from the manufacturer, and for the bigger jobs, one from NASA.」

He continued,「We make the measurements, go through one course of rounding, and then make the measurements again. If they don’t match well enough, we repeat the steps. Finally, when the diameter differences are small enough, we go for it.」

I woke up.「What do you mean, ‘go for it’?」I said.「It sounds sort of cavalier…」

「No, no,」he says.「That’s just the lingo we use when we mean that all the conditions are satisfied, and we’re ready to move to the next phase of the operation.」

「Do you ever write that down—that ‘go for it’?」

「Yes, sometimes.」

「Let’s see if we can find a place where you wrote it.」

Mr. Fichtel looked through his diary, and found an example. The expression was completely natural to him—it wasn’t reckless or cavalier; it was just his way of speaking.

On Monday and Tuesday, while I was running around down at Kennedy, Mr. Rogers was in Washington appearing before a Senate committee. Congress was considering whether it should have its own investigation.

Senator Hollings, from South Carolina, was giving Mr. Rogers a hard time:「Secretary Rogers,」he says,「I’m anxious that you have an adequate staff thayah. How many investigators does yo’ commission have?」

Mr. Rogers says,「We don’t have investigators in the police sense. We’re reading documents, understanding what they mean, organizing hearings, talking to witnesses—that sort of thing. We’ll have an adequate staff, I assure you.」

「Well, that’s the point,」Senator Hollings says.「From my experience in investigating cases, I’d want four or five investigators steeped in science and space technology going around down there at Canaveral talking to everybody, eating lunch with them. You’d be amazed, if you eat in the restaurants around there for two or three weeks, what you’ll find out. You can’t just sit and read what’s given to you.」

「We’re not just going to sit and read,」Mr. Rogers says defensively.「We’ve gotten a lot of people in a room and asked them questions all at the same time, rather than have a gumshoe walking around, talking to people one at a time.」

「I understand,」says Senator Hollings.「Yet I’m concerned about yo’ product if you don’t have some gumshoes. That’s the trouble with presidential commissions; I’ve been on ’em: they go on what’s fed to ’em, and they don’t look behind it. Then we end up with investigative reporters, people writing books, and everything else. People are still investigating the Warren Commission Report around this town.」*

Mr. Rogers calmly says,「I appreciate your comments, Senator. You’ll be interested to know that one of our commission members—he’s a Nobel laureate—is down there in Florida today, investigating in the way you’d like him to investigate.」

(Mr. Rogers didn’t know it, but I was actually eating lunch with some engineers when he said that!)

Senator Hollings says,「I’m not questioning the competence of the Nobel laureate; I’ve been reading with great interest what he said. There’s no question about the competence of the commission itself. It’s just that when you investigate a case, you need investigators. You have already brought to the public’s attention a lot of very interesting facts, so I think you haven’t been negligent in any fashion.」

So I saved Mr. Rogers a little bit. He saw that he had an answer for Mr. Hollings by the good luck that I stayed in Florida anyway, against his wishes!

Fantastic Figures

ON Tuesday afternoon I flew back to Washington, and went to the next meeting of the commission, on Wednesday. It was another public meeting. A manager of the Thiokol Company named Mr. Lund was testifying. On the night before the launch, Mr. Mulloy had told him to put on his「management hat」instead of his「engineering hat,」so he changed his opposition to launch and overruled his own engineers. I was asking him some harsh questions when suddenly I had this feeling of the Inquisition.

Mr. Rogers had pointed out to us that we ought to be careful with these people, whose careers depend on us. He said,「We have all the advantages: we’re sitting up here; they’re sitting down there. They have to answer our questions; we don’t have to answer their questions.」Suddenly, all this came back to me and I felt terrible, and I couldn’t do it the next day. I went back to California for a few days, to recover.

While I was in Pasadena, I went over to JPL and met with Jerry Solomon and Meemong Lee. They were studying the flame which appeared a few seconds before the main fuel tank exploded, and were able to bring out all kinds of details. (JPL has good enhancers of TV pictures from all their experience with planetary missions.) Later, I took the enhancements over to Charlie Stevenson and his crew at Kennedy to expedite things.

Somewhere along the line, somebody from the staff brought me something to sign: it said that my expenses were so-and-so much, but they weren’t—they were more. I said,「This is not the amount I actually spent.」

The guy said,「I know that, sir; you’re only allowed a maximum of $75 a day for the hotel and food.」

「Then why did you guys set me up in a hotel which costs $80 or $90 a night, and then you give me only $75 a day?」

「Yes, I agree; it’s too bad, but that’s the way it goes!」

I thought of Mr. Rogers’ offer to put me in a「good hotel.」What did he mean by that—that it would cost me more?

If you’re asked to contribute months of time and effort to the government (and you lose money you would have made consulting for a company), the government ought to appreciate it a little more than to be cheap about paying you back. I’m not trying to make money off the government, but I’m not wanting to lose money, either! I said,「I’m not going to sign this.」

Mr. Rogers came over and promised he would straighten it out, so I signed the paper.

I really think Mr. Rogers tried to fix it, but he was unable to. I thought of fighting this one to the end, but then I realized it’s impossible: if I had been paid for my actual expenses, then of course all the other commissioners would have to be paid, too. That would be all right, but it would also mean that this commission was the only commission to be paid its actual expenses—and pretty soon, word would get out.

They have a saying in New York:「You can’t fight City Hall,」meaning「It’s impossible.」But this time, it was a hell of a lot bigger than City Hall: the $75 a day rule is a law of the United States! It might have been fun to fight it to the end, but I guess I was tired—I’m not as young as I used to be—so I just gave up.

Somebody told me they heard commissioners make $1000 a day, but the truth is, our government doesn’t even pay their costs.

At the beginning of March, about a month after the commission started, we finally split up into working groups: the Pre-Launch Activities group was headed by Mr. Ache-son; Mr. Sutter was in charge of the Design, Development, and Production panel; General Kutyna was leader of the Accident Analysis group; and Dr. Ride was in charge of the Mission Planning and Operations group.

I spent most of my time in Kutyna’s group. I was in Ride’s group, too, but I ended up not doing very much for her.

General Kutyna’s group went to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to do its work. The first thing that happened there was, a man named Ullian came in to tell us something. As range safety officer at Kennedy, Mr. Ullian had to decide whether to put destruct charges on the shuttle. (If a rocket goes out of control, the destruct charges enable it to be blown up into small bits. That’s much less perilous than a rocket flying around loose, ready to explode when it hits the ground.)

Every unmanned rocket has these charges. Mr. Ullian told us that 5 out of 127 rockets that he looked at had failed—a rate of about 4 percent. He took that 4 percent and divided it by 4, because he assumed a manned flight would be safer than an unmanned one. He came out with about a 1 percent chance of failure, and that was enough to warrant the destruct charges.

But NASA told Mr. Ullian that the probability of failure was more like 1 in 105.

I tried to make sense out of that number.「Did you say 1 in 105?」

「That’s right; 1 in 100,000.」

「That means you could fly the shuttle every day for an average of 300 years between accidents—every day, one flight, for 300 years—which is obviously crazy!」

「Yes, I know,」said Mr. Ullian.「I moved my number up to 1 in 1000 to answer all of NASA’s claims—that they were much more careful with manned flights, that the typical rocket isn’t a valid comparison, et cetera—and put the destruct charges on anyway.」

But then a new problem came up: the Jupiter probe, Galileo, was going to use a power supply that runs on heat generated by radioactivity. If the shuttle carrying Galileo failed, radioactivity could be spread over a large area. So the argument continued: NASA kept saying 1 in 100,000 and Mr. Ullian kept saying 1 in 1000, at best.

Mr. Ullian also told us about the problems he had in trying to talk to the man in charge, Mr. Kingsbury: he could get appointments with underlings, but he never could get through to Kingsbury and find out how NASA got its figure of 1 in 100,000. The details of the story I can’t remember exactly, but I thought Mr. Ullian was doing everything sensibly.

Our panel supervised the tests that NASA was doing to discover the properties of the seals—how much pressure the putty could take, and so on—in order to find out exactly what had happened. General Kutyna didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so we went over and over things, checking all the evidence and seeing how well everything fitted together.

There was an awful lot of detailed discussion about exactly what happened in the last few seconds of the flight, but I didn’t pay much attention to any of it. It was as though a train had crashed because the track had a gap in it, and we were analyzing which cars broke apart first, which cars broke apart second, and why some car turned over on its side. I figured once the train goes off the track, it doesn’t make any difference—it’s done. I became bored.

So I made up a game for myself:「Imagine that something else had failed—the main engines, for instance—and we were making the same kind of intensive investigation as we are now: would we discover the same slipping safety criteria and lack of communication?」

I thought I would do my standard thing—find out from the engineers how the engine works, what all the dangers are, what problems they’ve had, and everything else—and then, when I’m all loaded up so I know what I’m talking about, I’d confront whoever was claiming the probability of failure was 1 in 100,000.

I asked to talk to a couple of engineers about the engines. The guy says,「Okay, I’ll fix it up. Is nine tomorrow morning okay?」

This time there were three engineers, their boss, Mr. Lovingood, and a few assistants—about eight or nine people.

Everybody had big, thick notebooks, full of papers, all nicely organized. On the front they said:

REPORT ON MATERIAL GIVEN TO COMMISSIONER RICHARD P. FEYNMAN ON MARCH WA-WA,* 1986.

I said,「Geez! You guys must have worked hard all night!」

「No, it’s not so much work; we just put in the regular papers that we use all the time.」

I said,「I just wanted to talk to a few engineers. There are so many problems to work on, I can’t expect you all to stay here and talk to me.」

But this time, everybody stayed.

Mr. Lovingood got up and began to explain everything to me in the usual NASA way, with charts and graphs which matched the information in my big book—all with bullets, of course.

I won’t bother you with all the details, but I wanted to understand everything about the engine. So I kept asking my usual dumb-sounding questions.

After a while, Mr. Lovingood says,「Dr. Feynman, we’ve been going for two hours, now. There are 123 pages, and we’ve only covered 20 so far.」

My first reaction was to say,「Well, it isn’t really going to take such a long time. I’m always a little slow at the beginning; it takes me a while to catch on. We’ll be able to go much faster near the end.」

But then I had a second thought. I said,「In order to speed things up, I’ll tell you what I’m doing, so you’ll know where I’m aiming. I want to know whether there’s the same lack of communication between the engineers and the management who are working on the engine as we found in the case of the booster rockets.」

Mr. Lovingood says,「I don’t think so. As a matter of fact, although I’m now a manager, I was trained as an engineer.」

「All right,」I said.「Here’s a piece of paper each. Please write on your paper the answer to this question: what do you think is the probability that a flight would be uncompleted due to a failure in this engine?」

They write down their answers and hand in their papers. One guy wrote「99-44/100% pure」(copying the Ivory soap slogan), meaning about 1 in 200. Another guy wrote something very technical and highly quantitative in the standard statistical way, carefully defining everything, that I had to translate—which also meant about 1 in 200. The third guy wrote, simply,「1 in 300.」

Mr. Lovingood’s paper, however, said,

Cannot quantify. Reliability is judged from:

• past experience

• quality control in manufacturing

• engineering judgment

「Well,」I said,「I’ve got four answers, and one of them weaseled.」I turned to Mr. Lovingood:「I think you weaseled.」

「I don’t think I weaseled.」

「You didn’t tell me what your confidence was, sir; you told me how you determined it. What I want to know is: after you determined it, what was it?」

He says,「100 percent」—the engineers’ jaws drop, my jaw drops; I look at him, everybody looks at him—」uh, uh, minus epsilon!」

So I say,「Well, yes; that’s fine. Now, the only problem is, WHAT IS EPSILON?」
