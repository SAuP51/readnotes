「No, thank you; everything is fine with my hotel.」

Pretty soon he tries again, so I say,「Mr. Rogers, my personal comfort is not what I’m concerned with. I’m trying to get to work. I want to do something!」

Finally, Rogers says it’s okay to go across the street to talk to people at NASA.

I was obviously quite a pain in the ass for Mr. Rogers. Later, Graham tried to explain it to me.「Suppose you, as a technical person, were given the job as chairman of a committee to look into some legal question. Your commission is mostly lawyers, and one of them keeps saying, ‘I can work more effectively if I talk directly to other lawyers.’ I assume you’d want to get your bearings first, before letting anybody rush off investigating on his own.」

Much later, I appreciated that there were lots of problems which Mr. Rogers had to address. For example, any piece of information any of us received had to be entered into the record and made available to the other commissioners, so a central library had to be set up. Things like that took time.

On Saturday morning I went to NASA. Graham brought in guys to tell me all about the shuttle. Although they were pretty high up in NASA, the guys were technical.

The first guy told me all about the solid rocket boosters—the propellant, the motor, the whole thing except the seals. He said,「The seals expert will be here this afternoon.」

The next guy told me all about the engine. The basic operation was more or less straightforward, but then there were all kinds of controls, with backing and hauling from pipes, heating from this and that, with high-pressure hydrogen pushing a little propeller which turns something else, which pumps oxygen through a vent valve—that kind of stuff.

It was interesting, and I did my best to understand it, but after a while I told the fella,「That’s as much as I’m going to take, now, on the engine.」

「But there are many problems with the engines that you should hear about,」he says.

I was hot on the trail of the booster rocket, so I said,「I’ll have to put off the main engines till later, when I have more time.」

Then a guy came in to tell me about the orbiter. I felt terrible, because he had come in on a Saturday to see me, and it didn’t look like the orbiter had anything to do with the accident. I was having enough trouble understanding the rest of the shuttle—there’s only a certain amount of information per cubic inch a brain can hold—so I let him tell me some of the stuff, but soon I had to tell him that it was getting too detailed, so we just had a pleasant conversation.

In the afternoon, the seals expert came in—his name was Mr. Weeks—and gave me what amounted to a continuation of my JPL briefing, with still more details.

There’s putty and other things, but the ultimate seal is supposed to be two rubber rings, called O-rings, which are approximately a quarter of an inch thick and lie on a circle 12 feet in diameter—that’s something like 37 feet long.

When the seals were originally designed by the Morton Thiokol Company, it was expected that pressure from the burning propellant would squash the O-rings. But because the joint is stronger than the wall (it’s three times thicker), the wall bows outward, causing the joint to bend a little—enough to lift the rubber O-rings off the seal area. Mr. Weeks told me this phenomenon is called「joint rotation,」and it was discovered very early, before they ever flew the shuttle.

The pieces of rubber in the joints are called O-rings, but they’re not used like normal O-rings are. In ordinary circumstances, such as sealing oil in the motor of an automobile, there are sliding parts and rotating shafts, but the gaps are always the same. An O-ring just sits there, in a fixed position.

But in the case of the shuttle, the gap expands as the pressure builds up in the rocket. And to maintain the seal, the rubber has to expand fast enough to close the gap—and during a launch, the gap opens in a fraction of a second.

FIGURE 7. Joint rotation is caused by pressure from inside the rocket pushing the walls out farther than the joints. A gap opens, and hot gas flows past one or both of the O-rings.

Thus the resilience of the rubber became a very essential part of the design.

When the Thiokol engineers were discovering these problems, they went to the Parker Seal Company, which manufactures the rubber, to ask for advice. The Parker Seal Company told Thiokol that O-rings are not meant to be used that way, so they could give no advice.

Although it was known from nearly the beginning that the joint was not working as it was designed to, Thiokol kept struggling with the device. They made a number of makeshift improvements. One was to put shims in to keep the joint tight, but the joint still leaked. Mr. Weeks showed me pictures of leaks on previous flights—what the engineers called「blowby,」a blackening behind an O-ring where hot gas leaked through, and what they called「erosion,」where an O-ring had burned a little bit. There was a chart showing all the flights, and how serious the blowby and erosion were on each one. We went through the whole history up to the flight, 51-L.

I said,「Where does it say they were ever discussing the problem—how it’s going along, or whether there’s some progress?」

The only place was in the「flight readiness reviews」—between flights there was no discussion of the seals problem!

We looked at the summary of the report. Everything was behind little bullets, as usual. The top line says:

•

The lack of a good secondary seal in the field joint is most critical and ways to reduce joint rotation should be incorporated as soon as possible to reduce criticality.

And then, near the bottom, it says:

•

Analysis of existing data indicates that it is safe to continue flying existing design as long as all joints are leak checked* with a 200 psig stabilization…

I was struck by the contradiction:「If it’s ‘most critical,’ how could it be ‘safe to continue flying’? What’s the logic of this?」

Mr. Weeks says,「Yes, I see what you mean! Well, let’s see: it says here, ‘Analysis of existing data…’「

We went back through the report and found the analysis. It was some kind of computer model with various as-

Figure 8 Thiokol attempted to cure the joint-rotation problem with shims.

Figure 9 Two examples O-ring erosion. Such erosion would occur unpredictably along 2 or 3 inches of the 37-foot O-ring.

Figure 11 The self-contradictory recommendations of the seals report are underlined.

sumptions that were not necessarily right. You know the danger of computers, it’s called GIGO: garbage in, garbage out! The analysis concluded that a little unpredictable leakage here and there could be tolerated, even though it wasn’t part of the original design.

If all the seals had leaked, it would have been obvious even to NASA that the problem was serious. But only a few of the seals leaked on only some of the flights. So NASA had developed a peculiar kind of attitude: if one of the seals leaks a little and the flight is successful, the problem isn’t so serious. Try playing Russian roulette that way: you pull the trigger and the gun doesn’t go off, so it must be safe to pull the trigger again…

Mr. Weeks said there was a rumor that the history of the seals problem was being leaked to the newspapers. That bothered him a little bit, because it made NASA look like it was trying to keep things secret.

I told him I was entirely satisfied with the people Graham had brought in to talk to me, and that since I had already heard about the seals problem at JPL, it wasn’t any big deal.

The next day, Sunday, Bill Graham took me with his family to the National Air and Space Museum. We had an early breakfast together, and then we went across the street to the museum.

I was expecting to see big crowds there, but I had forgotten that Graham was such a big shot. We had the whole place to ourselves for a while.

We did see Sally Ride there. She was in a display case, in an astronaut’s suit, holding a helmet and everything. The wax model looked exactly like her.

At the museum there was a special theater with a movie about NASA and its achievements. The movie was wonderful. I had not fully appreciated the enormous number of people who were working on the shuttle, and all the effort that had gone into making it. And you know how a movie is: they can make it dramatic. It was so dramatic that I almost began to cry. I could see that the accident was a terrible blow. To think that so many people were working so hard to make it go—and then it busts—made me even more determined to help straighten out the problems of the shuttle as quickly as possible, to get all those people back on track. After seeing this movie I was very changed, from my semi anti-NASA attitude to a very strong pro-NASA attitude.

That afternoon, I got a telephone call from General Kutyna.

「Professor Feynman?」he says.「I have some urgent news for you. Uh, just a minute.」

I hear some military-type band music in the background.

The music stops, and General Kutyna says,「Excuse me, Professor; I’m at an Air Force Band concert, and they just played the national anthem.」

I could picture him in his uniform, standing at attention while the band is playing the「Star Spangled Banner,」saluting with one hand and holding the telephone with the other.「What’s the news, General?」

「Well, the first thing is, Rogers told me to tell you not to go over to NASA.」

I didn’t pay any attention to that, because I had already gone over to NASA the day before.

He continued,「The other thing is, we’re going to have a special meeting tomorrow afternoon to hear from a guy whose story came out in the New York Times today.」

I laughed inside: so we’re going to have a special meeting on Monday, anyway!

Then he says,「I was working on my carburetor this morning, and I was thinking: the shuttle took off when the temperature was 28 or 29 degrees. The coldest temperature previous to that was 53 degrees. You’re a professor; what, sir, is the effect of cold on the O-rings?」

「Oh!」I said.「It makes them stiff. Yes, of course!」That’s all he had to tell me. It was a clue for which I got a lot of credit later, but it was his observation. A professor of theoretical physics always has to be told what to look for. He just uses his knowledge to explain the observations of the experimenters!

On Monday morning General Kutyna and I went over to Graham’s office and asked him if he had any information on the effects of temperature on the O-rings. He didn’t have it on hand, but said he would get it to us as soon as possible.

Graham did, however, have some interesting photographs to show us. They showed a flame growing from the right-hand solid rocket booster a few seconds before the explosion. It was hard to tell exactly where the flame was coming out, but there was a model of the shuttle right there in the office. I put the model on the floor and walked around it until it looked exactly like the picture—in size, and in orientation.

I noticed that on each booster rocket there’s a little hole—called the leak test port—where you can put pressure in to test the seals. It’s between the two O-rings, so if it’s not closed right and if the first O-ring fails, the gas would go out through the hole, and it would be a catastrophe. It was just about where the flame was. Of course, it was still a question whether the flame was coming out of the leak test port or a larger flame was coming out farther around, and we were seeing only the tip of it.

That afternoon we had our emergency closed meeting to hear from the guy whose story was in the New York Times. His name was Mr. Cook. He was in the budget department of NASA when he was asked to look into a possible seals problem and to estimate the costs needed to rectify it.

By talking to the engineers, he found out that the seals had been a big problem for a long time. So he reported that it would cost so-and-so much to fix it—a lot of money. From the point of view of the press and some of the commissioners, Mr. Cook’s story sounded like a big exposé, as if NASA was hiding the seals problem from us.

I had to sit through this big, unnecessary excitement, wondering if every time there was an article in the newspaper, would we have to have a special meeting? We would never get anywhere that way!

But later, during that same meeting, some very interesting things happened. First, we saw some pictures which showed puffs of smoke coming out of a field joint just after ignition, before the shuttle even got off the pad. The smoke was coming out of the same place—possibly the leak test port—where the flame appeared later. There wasn’t much question, now. It was all fitting together.

Then something happened that was completely unexpected. An engineer from the Thiokol Company, a Mr. McDonald, wanted to tell us something. He had come to our meeting on his own, uninvited. Mr. McDonald reported that the Thiokol engineers had come to the conclusion that low temperatures had something to do with the seals problem, and they were very, very worried about it. On the night before the launch, during the flight readiness review, they told NASA the shuttle shouldn’t fly if the temperature was below 53 degrees—the previous lowest temperature—and on that morning it was 29.

Mr. McDonald said NASA was「appalled」by that statement. The man in charge of the meeting, a Mr. Mulloy, argued that the evidence was「incomplete」—some flights with erosion and blowby had occurred at higher than 53 degrees—so Thiokol should reconsider its opposition to flying.

Figure 12a Progression of a flame, possibly from the leak test port area(© NASA.)

Thiokol reversed itself, but McDonald refused to go along, saying,「If something goes wrong with this flight, I wouldn’t want to stand up in front of a board of inquiry and say that I went ahead and told them to go ahead and fly this thing outside what it was qualified to.」

That was so astonishing that Mr. Rogers had to ask,「Did I understand you correctly, that you said…,」and he repeated the story. And McDonald says,「Yes, sir.」

The whole commission was shocked, because this was the first time any of us had heard this story: not only was there a failure in the seals, but there may have been a failure in management, too.

Figure 12a An incorrectly sealed leak test port could provide an escape route for a flame which burns past the primary O-ring.

Mr. Rogers decided that we should look carefully into Mr. McDonald’s story, and get more details before we made it public. But to keep the public informed, we would have an open meeting the following day, Tuesday, in which Mr. Cook would testify.

I thought,「This is going to be like an act: we’re going to say the same things tomorrow as we did today, and we won’t learn anything new.」

As we were leaving, Bill Graham came over with a stack of papers for me.

「Geez! That’s fast!」I said.「I only asked you for the information this morning!」Graham was always very cooperative.

Figure 14 Puffs of black「smoke」(fine unburned particles) were seen escaping from the same place where the flame was observed.(© NASA.)

The paper on top says,「Professor Feynman of the Presidential Commission wants to know about the effects over time of temperature on the resiliency of the O-rings…」—it’s a memorandum addressed to a subordinate.

Under that memo is another memo:「Professor Feynman of the Presidential Commission wants to know…」—from that subordinate to his subordinate, and so on down the line.

There’s a paper with some numbers on it from the poor bastard at the bottom, and then there’s a series of submission papers which explain that the answer is being sent up to the next level.

So here’s this stack of papers, just like a sandwich, and in the middle is the answer—to the wrong question! The answer was:「You squeeze the rubber for two hours at a certain temperature and pressure, and then see how long it takes to creep back」—over hours. I wanted to know how fast the rubber responds in milliseconds during a launch. So the information was of no use.

I went back to my hotel. I’m feeling lousy and I’m eating dinner; I look at the table, and there’s a glass of ice water. I say to myself,「Damn it, I can find out about that rubber without having NASA send notes back and forth: I just have to try it! All I have to do is get a sample of the rubber.」

I think,「I could do this tomorrow while we’re all sittin’ around, listening to this Cook crap we heard today. We always get ice water in those meetings; that’s something I can do to save time.」

Then I think,「No, that would be gauche.」

But then I think of Luis Alvarez, the physicist. He’s a guy I admire for his gutsiness and sense of humor, and I think,「If Alvarez was on this commission, he would do it, and that’s good enough for me.」

There are stories of physicists—great heroes—who have gotten information one, two, three—just like that—where everybody else is trying to do it in a complicated way. For example, after ultraviolet rays and X-rays had been discovered, there was a new type, called N-rays, discovered by André Blondel, in France. It was hard to detect the N-rays: other scientists had difficulty repeating Blondel’s experiments, so someone asked the great American physicist R. W. Wood to go to Blondel’s laboratory.

Blondel gave a public lecture and demonstration. N-rays were bent by aluminum, so he had all kinds of lenses lined up, followed by a big disk with an aluminum prism in the middle. As the aluminum prism slowly turned, the N-rays came up this way and bent that way, and Blondel’s assistant reported their intensity—different numbers for different angles.

N-rays were affected by light, so Blondel turned out the lights to make his readings more sensitive. His assistant continued to report their intensity.

When the lights came back on, there’s R. W. Wood in the front row, holding the prism high in the air, balanced on the tips of his fingers, for all to see! So that was the end of the N-ray.

I think,「Exactly! I’ve got to get a sample of the rubber.」I call Bill Graham.

It’s impossible to get: it’s kept somewhere down at Kennedy. But then Graham remembers that the model of the field joint we’re going to use in our meeting tomorrow has two samples of the rubber in it. He says,「We could meet in my office before the meeting and see if we can get the rubber out.」

The next morning I get up early and go out in front of my hotel. It’s eight in the morning and it’s snowing. I find a taxi and say to the driver,「I’d like to go to a hardware store.」

「A hardware store, sir?」

「Yeah. I gotta get some tools.」

「Sir, there’s no hardware stores around here; the Capitol is over there, the White House is over there—wait a minute: I think I remember passing one the other day.」

He found the hardware store, and it turned out it didn’t open till 8:30—it was about 8:15—so I waited outside, in my suitcoat and tie, a costume I had assumed since I came to Washington in order to move among the natives without being too conspicuous.

The suitcoats that the natives wear inside their buildings (which are well heated) are sufficient for walking from one building to another—or from a building to a taxi if the buildings are too far apart. (All the taxis are heated.) But the natives seem to have a strange fear of the cold: they put overcoats on top of their suitcoats if they wish to step outside. I hadn’t bought an overcoat yet, so I was still rather conspicuous standing outside the hardware store in the snow.

At 8:30 I went in and bought a couple of screwdrivers, some pliers, and the smallest C-clamp I could find. Then I went to NASA.

On the way to Graham’s office, I thought maybe the clamp was too big. I didn’t have much time, so I ran down to the medical department of NASA. (I knew where it was, because I had been going there for blood tests ordered by my cardiologist, who was trying to treat me by telephone.) I asked for a medical clamp like they put on tubes.

They didn’t have any. But the guy says,「Well, let’s see if your C-clamp fits inside a glass!」It fitted very easily.

I went up to Graham’s office.

The rubber came out of the model easily with just a pair of pliers. So there I was with the rubber sample in my hand. Although I knew it would be more dramatic and honest to do the experiment for the first time in the public meeting, I did something that I’m a little bit ashamed of. I cheated. I couldn’t resist. I tried it. So, following the example of having a closed meeting before an open meeting,I discovered it worked before I did it in the open meeting. Then I put the rubber back into the model so Graham could take it to the meeting.

FIGURE 15. The field-joint model from which Feynman gol the O-ring sample.

I go to the meeting, all ready, with pliers in one pocket and a C-clamp in the other. I sit down next to General Kutyna.

At the previous meeting, there was ice water for everybody. This time, there’s no ice water. I get up and go over to somebody who looks like he’s in charge, and I say,「I’d like a glass of ice water, please.」

He says,「Certainly! Certainly!」

Five minutes later, the guards close the doors, the meeting starts, and I haven’t got my ice water.

I gesture over to the guy I just talked to. He comes over and says,「Don’t worry, it’s coming!」

The meeting is going along, and now Mr. Mulloy begins to tell us about the seals. (Apparently, NASA wants to tell us about the seals before Mr. Cook does.) The model starts to go around, and each commissioner looks at it a little bit.

Meanwhile, no ice water!

Mr. Mulloy explains how the seals are supposed to work—in the usual NASA way: he uses funny words and acronyms, and it’s hard for anybody else to understand.

In order to set things up while I’m waiting for the ice water, I start out:「During a launch, there are vibrations which cause the rocket joints to move a little bit—is that correct?」

「That is correct, sir.」

「And inside the joints, these so-called O-rings are supposed to expand to make a seal—is that right?」

「Yes, sir. In static conditions they should be in direct contact with the tang and clevis* and squeezed twenty-thousandths of an inch.」

「Why don’t we take the O-rings out?」

「Because then you would have hot gas expanding through the joint…」

「Now, in order for the seal to work correctly, the O-rings must be made of rubber—not something like lead, which, when you squash it, it stays.」

「Yes, sir.」

「Now, if the O-ring weren’t resilient for a second or two, would that be enough to be a very dangerous situation?」

「Yes, sir.」

That led us right up to the question of cold temperature and the resilience of the rubber. I wanted to prove that Mr. Mulloy must have known that temperature had an effect, although—according to Mr. McDonald—he claimed that the evidence was「incomplete.」But still, no ice water! So I had to stop, and somebody else started asking questions.

The model comes around to General Kutyna, and then to me. The clamp and pliers come out of my pocket, I take the model apart, I’ve got the O-ring pieces in my hand, but I still haven’t got any ice water! I turn around again and signal the guy I’ve been bothering about it, and he signals back,「Don’t worry, you’ll get it!」

Pretty soon I see a young woman, way down in front, bringing in a tray with glasses on it. She gives a glass of ice water to Mr. Rogers, she gives a glass of ice water to Mr. Armstrong, she works her way back and forth along the rows of the dais, giving ice water to everybody! The poor woman had gotten everything together—jug, glasses, ice, tray, the whole thing—so that everybody could have ice water.

So finally, when I get my ice water, I don’t drink it! I squeeze the rubber in the C-clamp, and put them in the glass of ice water.

After a few minutes, I’m ready to show the results of my little experiment. I reach for the little button that activates my microphone.

General Kutyna, who’s caught on to what I’m doing, quickly leans over to me and says,「Co-pilot to pilot: not now.」

Pretty soon, I’m reaching for my microphone again.

「Not now!」He points in our briefing book—with all the charts and slides Mr. Mulloy is going through—and says,「When he comes to this slide, here, that’s the right time to do it.」

Finally Mr. Mulloy comes to the place, I press the button for my microphone, and I say,「I took this rubber from the model and put it in a clamp in ice water for a while.」

I take the clamp out, hold it up in the air, and loosen it as I talk:「I discovered that when you undo the clamp, the rubber doesn’t spring back. In other words, for more than a few seconds, there is no resilience in this particular material when it is at a temperature of 32 degrees. I believe that

FIGURE 15A. The O-ring ice-water demonstration. (© MARILYNN K. YEE, NYT PICTURES.)

has some significance for our problem.」

Before Mr. Mulloy could say anything, Mr. Rogers says,「That is a matter we will consider, of course, at length in the session that we will hold on the weather, and I think it is an important point which I’m sure Mr. Mulloy acknowledges and will comment on in a further session.」

During the lunch break, reporters came up to me and asked questions like,「Were you talking about the O-ring, or the putty?」and「Would you explain to us what an CD-ring is, exactly?」So I was rather depressed that I wasn’t able to make my point. But that night, all the news shows caught on to the significance of the experiment, and the next day, the newspaper articles explained everything perfectly.

Check Six!

MY cousin Frances educated me about the press. She had been the AP White House correspondent during the Nixon and Ford administrations, and was now working for CNN. Frances would tell me stories of guys running out back doors because they’re afraid of the press. From her I got the idea that the press isn’t doing anything evil; the reporters are simply trying to help people know what’s going on, and it doesn’t do any harm to be courteous to them.

I found out that they’re really quite friendly, if you give them a chance. So I wasn’t afraid of the press, and I would always answer their questions.

Reporters would explain to me that I could say,「Not for attribution.」But I didn’t want any hocus-pocus. I didn’t want it to sound like I’m leaking something. So whenever I talked to the press, I was straight. As a result of this, my name was in the newspaper every day, all over the place!

It seemed like I was always the one answering the reporters’ questions. Often the rest of the commissioners would be anxious to go off to lunch, and I’d still be there, answering questions. But I figured,「What’s the point of having a public meeting if you run away when they ask you what a word meant?」

When we’d finally get to our lunch, Mr. Rogers would remind us to be careful not to talk to the press. I would say something like,「Well, I was just telling them about the O-rings.」

He would say,「That’s okay. You’ve been doing all right, Dr. Feynman; I have no problem with that.」So I never did figure out, exactly, what he meant by「not talking to the press.」

Being on the commission was rather tense work, so I enjoyed having dinner once in a while with Frances and Chuck, my sister’s son, who was working for the Washington Post. Because Mr. Rogers kept talking about leaks, we made sure we never said a word about anything I was doing. If CNN needed to find out something from me, they’d have to send a different reporter. The same went for the Post.

I told Mr. Rogers about my relatives working for the press:「We’ve agreed not to talk about my work. Do you think there’s any problem?」

He smiled and said,「It’s perfectly all right. I have a cousin in the press, too. There’s no problem at all.」

On Wednesday the commission had nothing to do, so General Kutyna invited me over to the Pentagon to educate me on the relationship between the air force and NASA.

It was the first time I had ever been in the Pentagon. There were all these guys in uniform who would take orders—not like in civilian life. He says to one of them,「I’d like to use the briefing room…」

「Yes, sir!」

「… and we’ll need to see slides number such-and-such and so-and-so.」

「Yes, sir! Yes, sir!」

We’ve got all these guys working for us while General Kutyna gives me a big presentation in this special briefing room. The slides are shown from the back on a transparent wall. It was really fancy.

General Kutyna would say things like,「Senator So-and-so is in NASA’s pocket,」and I would say, half-joking,「Don’t give me these side remarks, General; you’re filling my head! But don’t worry, I’ll forget it all.」I wanted to be naive: I’d find out what happened to the shuttle first; I’d worry about the big political pressures later.

Somewhere in his presentation, General Kutyna observed that everybody on the commission has some weakness because of their connections: he, having worked very closely with NASA personnel in his former position as Air Force Space Shuttle Program manager, finds it difficult, if not impossible, to drive home some of the tougher questions on NASA management. Sally Ride still has a job with NASA, so she can’t just say everything she wants. Mr. Covert had worked on the engines, and had been a consultant to NASA, and so on.

I said,「I’m associated with Caltech, but I don’t consider that a weakness!」

「Well,」he says,「that’s right. You’re invincible—as far as we can see. But in the air force we have a rule: check six.」

He explained,「A guy is flying along, looking in all directions, and feeling very safe. Another guy flies up behind him (at ‘six o’clock’—‘twelve o’clock’ is directly in front), and shoots. Most airplanes are shot down that way. Thinking that you’re safe is very dangerous! Somewhere, there’s a weakness you’ve got to find. You must always check six o’clock.」

An underling comes in. There’s some mumbling about somebody else needing the briefing room now. General Kutyna says,「Tell them I’ll be finished in ten minutes.」

「Yes, sir!」

Finally, we go out. There, in the hall, are TEN GENERALS waiting to use the room—and I had been sitting in there, getting this personal briefing. I felt great.

For the rest of the day, I wrote a letter home. I began to worry about「check six」when I described Mr. Rogers’ reaction to my visiting Frances and Chuck. I wrote, … I was pleased by Rogers’ reaction, but now as I write this I have second thoughts. It was too easy—after he explicitly talked about the importance of no leaks etc. at earlier meetings. Am I being set up? (SEE, DARLING, WASHINGTON PARANOIA IS SETTING IN.)… I think it is possible that there are things in this somebody might be trying to keep me from finding out and might try to discredit me if I get too close.… So, reluctantly, I will have to not visit Frances and Chuck any more. Well, I’ll ask Fran first if that is too paranoid. Rogers seemed so agreeable and reassuring. It was so easy, yet I am probably a thorn in his side.…

Tomorrow at 6:15 am we go by special airplane (two planes) to Kennedy Space Center to be「briefed.」No doubt we shall wander about, being shown everything—gee whiz—but no time to get into technical details with anybody. Well, it won’t work. If I am not satisfied by Friday, I will stay over Sat & Sun, or if they don’t work then, Monday & Tuesday. I am determined to do the job of finding out what happened—let the chips fall!

My guess is that I will be allowed to do this, overwhelmed with data and details…, so they have time to soften up dangerous witnesses etc. But it won’t work because (1) I do technical information exchange and understanding much faster than they imagine, and (2) I already smell certain rats that I will not forget, because I just love the smell of rats, for it is the spoor of exciting adventure.

I feel like a bull in a china shop. The best thing is to put the bull out to work on the plow. A better metaphor will be an ox in a china shop, because the china is the bull, of course.*

So, much as I would rather be home and doing something else, I am having a wonderful time.

Love,

Richard

The press was reporting rumors that NASA was under great political pressure to launch the shuttle, and there were various theories as to where the pressure was coming

from. It was a great big world of mystery to me, with tremendous forces. I would investigate it, all right, and if I protected myself, nothing would happen. But I hadda watch out.

Gumshoes

FINALLY, early on Thursday morning, we get to Florida. The original idea was that we would go around the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral and see everything on a guided tour. But because information was coming out in the newspapers so fast, we had a public meeting first.

First, we saw some detailed pictures of the smoke coming out of the shuttle while it was still on the launch pad. There are cameras all over the place watching the launch—something like a hundred of them. Where the smoke came out, there were two cameras looking straight at it—but both failed, curiously. Nevertheless, from other cameras we could see four or five puffs of black smoke coming out from a field joint. This smoke was not burning material; it was simply carbon and mucky stuff that was pushed out because of pressure inside the rocket.

The puffs stopped after a few seconds: the seal got plugged up somehow, temporarily, only to break open again a minute later.

There was some discussion about how much matter came out in the smoke. The puffs of smoke were about six feet long, and a few feet thick. The amount of matter depends on how fine the particles are, and there could always be a big piece of glop inside the smoke cloud, so it’s hard to judge. And because the pictures were taken from the side, it was possible there was more smoke farther around the rocket.

To establish a minimum, I assumed a particle size that would produce as much smoke as possible out of a given amount of material. It came out surprisingly small—approximately one cubic inch: if you have a cubic inch of stuff, you can get that much smoke.

We asked for pictures from other launches. We found out later that there had never been any puffs of smoke on any previous flights.

We also heard about the low temperatures before the launch from a man named Charlie Stevenson, who was in charge of the ice crew. He said the temperature had gone down to 22 degrees during the night, but his crew got readings as low as 8 degrees at some places on the launch pad, and they couldn’t understand why.
