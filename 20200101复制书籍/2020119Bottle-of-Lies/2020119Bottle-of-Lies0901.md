「in a month or two months maximum」: Wockhardt Ltd. did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls seeking comment. However, after the FDA issued its import alert, Wockhardt CEO Habil Khorakiwala held an emergency conference call on May 24, 2013. During the call, he sought to reassure investors that the company was working to satisfy the FDA’s concerns and planned to hire a U.S. consultant to help bring「this facility into compliance in a month or two months maximum.」When pressed by an investor, Khorakiwala said that the reason the FDA found so many lapses in Waluj was because the bulk of products manufactured at one facility there were destined for non-U.S. markets. The FDA wound up inspecting this facility, which wasn’t explicitly set up to meet rigorous U.S. standards.

Malik submitted his resignation on June 1, 2003 but stayed on for approximately another two months.」

in June 2003: According to the MOI, Malik and his Ranbaxy team were hired by the generic drug company Sandoz, in Vienna, where they stayed for two years.

It could often mean「better」: Some of India’s leading generic drug manufacturers have argued that they could make superior drugs but are restricted by regulations that require their products to be similar to the brand. At Cipla, Dr. Yusuf Hamied explained that though his chemists were the best in the world,「I have to be as bad as the original,」he said.

For more details of the FDA’s bioequivalence standards, see also「Preface,」in Orange Book; Lynda S. Welage, Duane M. Kirking, Frank J. Ascione, and Caroline A. Gaither,「Understanding the Scientific Issues Embedded in the Generic Drug Approval Process,」Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association 41, no. 6 (2001): 856–67, doi:10.1016/s1086-5802(16)31327-4.

So, in 1992: The FDA published a guidance in July 1992 that outlined the central concepts of bioequivalence:「Statistical Procedures for Bioequivalence Studies Using a Standard Two Treatment Cross-over Design」(Washington, DC: FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 1992). That guidance recommended a statistical analysis for pharmacokinetic measures, including AUC and Cmax. It proposed a calculation of a 90 percent confidence interval for the ratio of averages, and a requirement that this confidence interval fall within a range of 80 to 125 percent bioequivalence. The FDA deemed this approach「average bioequivalence.」However, the debate over bioequivalence wasn’t put to rest with the 1992 guidance, as documented in Robert Schall’s「Bioequivalence: Tried and Tested」(Cardiovascular Journal of Africa 21, no. 2 [April 2010]: 69–70), because, at the same time the FDA issued its guidance, the biostatisticians Sharon Anderson and Walter W. Hauk raised a new question about whether drugs deemed「bioequivalent」work the same way in different patients, with implications for patients switching from one drug to another. This concept, dubbed「individual bioequivalence,」became a new area of research and debate. Yet there was doubt about whether the new concept of individual bioequivalence was a legitimate concern or an unnecessary precaution. According to Schall and other critics, the FDA essentially ignored the concept in its 2003 guidance, which instead reiterated the 1992 definition of average bioequivalence; see「Guidance for Industry: Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Orally Administered Drug Products: General Considerations」(Washington DC: FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, March 2003).

「Everyone knows,」he said, by way of greeting: The details of Dinesh Thakur’s interaction with Arun Kumar come, in part, from an account that Dinesh Thakur drafted, starting one year after he left Ranbaxy. Reached in May 2013, Arun Kumar denied that he shared information with Thakur and claimed instead that he shared it with the company. He asserted that management launched an investigation because it didn’t know about the misconduct. He did not respond to more recent attempts to contact him. Thakur’s account of Arun Kumar sharing information for his review and working on his report is corroborated by an interview that Dr. Raj Kumar gave to FDA criminal investigators in which he told them:「Kumar asked the Director of Regulatory Affairs, Arun Kumar if there was exposure on other Ranbaxy products in addition to the ARVs and without hesitation Kumar responded, ‘Yes.’ Kumar instructed Arun Kumar and Thakur to provide a risk assessment and a summary of what the problematic issues were with Ranbaxy ARV products.」Rajinder Kumar,「Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Memorandum of Interview,」April 10, 2007.

Ranbaxy, shown by prosecutors to Ranbaxy lawyers on November 17, 2009.

Though well-meaning and candid with investigators, he also had what the Washington Post dubbed a「lunch problem.」He enjoyed regular lunches with industry executives, who lobbied him during the meals and then picked up the tab. He’d been reprimanded for the habit almost a decade earlier. At the scandal’s height, he signed an affidavit claiming that the lunches had stopped, when they hadn’t. In 1990, Seife was convicted on two counts of perjury and sentenced to ten months in a Texas prison. There, he was given ill-fitting shoes. Seife was a diabetic and prone to foot infections.

the FDA simply reviewed the bioequivalence data: Although Teva marketed and sold generic Budeprion, the drug was manufactured and developed by Impax, which provided bioequivalence data in its 2003 application to the FDA. After the drug was pulled, Teva sued Impax for misrepresenting its bioequivalence. These events were reported in Roger Bate et al.,「Generics Substitution, Bioequivalence Standards, and International Oversight: Complex Issues Facing the FDA,」Trends in Pharmacological Science 37, no. 3 (December 2015), doi:10.1016/j.tips.2015.11.005; and Dan Packel,「Impax Must Pay for GSK Wellbutrin Settlement, Teva Says,」Law360, August 31, 2017, https://www.law360.com/articles/959538/impax-must-pay-for-gsk-wellbutrin-settlement-teva-says (accessed May 29, 2018).

This update to the FDA’s guidance affects the bioequivalence rating of the product and does not reflect any safety issue. Teva’s first priority is to our patients and providing them with quality medicines.」Teva did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this book.

Horrified, she watched as the bug: Carla Stouffer’s complaint, though filed with the FDA, never reached Dr. Reddy’s. The company stated:「From 2011 to date, Dr. Reddy’s has not received any communication, complaint or intimation relating to insect in dosage forms of this product.」Descriptions of adverse events were pulled from the FDA’s Drug Quality Reporting System (DQRS) (MedWatch Reports) database. Carla Stouffer’s complaint is logged as number 1603903 in the DQRS database. Each year the FDA receives millions of such reports from patients, caregivers, and the general public; see Lichy Han, Robert Ball, Carol A. Pamer, Russ B.

drew defensive attacks from the FDA: Dr. Preston Mason’s findings about low-quality generic Lipitor appeared in the May/June 2013 issue of the Journal of Clinical Lipidology—just six months after Ranbaxy’s recall of its own generic Lipitor product due to the presence of tiny glass particles. The FDA reacted defensively to Mason’s study. During an interview with a Bloomberg reporter, CDER director Janet Woodcock claimed that Mason’s team didn’t use proper testing methods and therefore contaminated its own samples. Woodcock later repeated this attack in a paper cowritten with Mansoor A. Khan,「FDA Analysis of Atorvastatin Products Refutes Report of Methyl Ester Impurities,」Therapeutic Innovation and Regulatory Science 48, no. 5 (May 27, 2014): 554–56, doi:10.1177/2168479014536567. However, Mason had used the same testing method prescribed by the USP to test all his samples, and the methylated impurities that Woodcock claimed were proof of improper testing appeared only in some.

ended its partnership with Zhejiang Hisun: On November 10, 2017, roughly two and a half years after Baker’s inspection, Pfizer sold its 49 percent equity share in Hisun-Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, though it retained rights to manufacture, sell, and distribute the current and pipeline products that had resulted from the joint venture.

Baker went to Dalian in the Liaodong Peninsula: FDA,「Form 483: Inspectional Observations,」Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Dalian, China, April 13–17, 2015.

There, too, he found: In response to the events at Dalian, a Pfizer spokesperson said,「Pfizer has responded and addressed the issues raised during the pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing site at Dalian. The issues cited in the FDA Form-483 do not indicate any quality or safety concerns and do not have any impact on products currently on the market manufactured at the Dalian site.」

where fraud was endemic: In 2016, an investigation by China’s own State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) found that 80 percent of clinical trial data submitted by Chinese companies to regulators to gain approval for new drugs was fabricated. Fiona Macdonald,「80% of Data in Chinese Clinical Trials Have Been Fabricated,」Science Alert, October 1, 2016, https://www.sciencealert.com/80-of-the-data-in-chinese-clinical-trial-is-fabricated (accessed September 30, 2018).

That, in turn, jeopardized FDA funding: In 1992, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) permitted the FDA to collect fees from companies seeking approval for new drugs. Subsequent laws expanded the so-called「user fee」system to encompass the generic drug and medical device industries. Collectively, user fees now comprise about 40 percent of the FDA’s total budget. The system is not without critics, with some arguing that the revenue generated from user fees might limit the FDA’s ability to make impartial regulatory decisions. An FDA spokesperson said prescription drug user fees have helped the FDA to provide「timely review」of drug applications. J. Carroll,「PDUFA Faces Rough Reauthorization,」Biotechnology Healthcare (July 2007); see also Tara O’Neill Hayes and Anna Catalanotto,「Primer: FDA User Fees,」American Action Forum, August 22, 2017.

to make the final classifications less severe: In Zhejiang province, China, Bangli Medical Products held an FDA investigator hostage in its conference room, trapping her there for hours and demanding that she destroy the photographs she’d taken. It seemed clear to the FDA’s staff in China that the company had refused a for-cause inspection and its drugs needed to be blocked. An FDA supervisor wrote back to officials in Maryland:「Needless to say, they first refused the inspections and refused to recognize our investigator’s authority to inspect the premises. We need to immediately put this firm on import alert.」But an official at FDA headquarters quickly sounded a note of caution about「declaring that we have ‘authority’ in the foreign arena.」Another official weighed in, stating that it didn’t appear the plant manager who’d imprisoned the FDA’s investigator「was making a specified refusal.」The incident is documented in: Kelli Giannattasio,「Re: For Cause Inspection of Bangli Medical Products,」email to Susan F. Laska and Sherry Bous, July 27, 2016.

made by bureaucrats in Maryland: In a written statement, an FDA spokesperson explained,「The FDA can and does change assessments of a plant’s compliance. After the initial data gathered by the investigator is reviewed by both the Office of Regulatory Affairs and the Center for Drug Evaluation, additional information can be taken into account. Oftentimes, a firm is not able to provide paperwork at the time of an inspection but can produce documents later on that provide more insight into the matter.
