# Part II India Rises

1920 | Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India

For many years, few people wanted to take Indian medicine, let alone praise the companies making it. To the brand-name pharmaceutical companies that had spent decades and millions developing drugs, the Indian companies that copied their products were no better than thieves. They deserved to be sued rather than thanked. And to patients around the world, the MADE IN INDIA label connoted flea-market quality they’d prefer to avoid.

Behind the scenes, however, one man did more than anyone to change this perception and lay the path that led to Bill Clinton’s visit: Dr. Yusuf K. Hamied. For years, as the chairman of the Indian drug giant Cipla Ltd., he had made drugs that even his own government wouldn’t buy and made bold public offers that most people ignored. He didn’t care what anyone thought of him. He relished the ire of the brand-name companies he battled. And then one day in 2001, he made an announcement that attached a whole new set of words to Indian drug makers: iconoclasts, visionaries, saviors.

But Dr. Hamied’s story — and the launch of India’s modern-day pharmaceutical industry — really began a century ago, in an ashram. Not just any ashram, but the Sabarmati Ashram founded by Mahatma Gandhi in what today is Ahmedabad, in the western state of Gujarat. From there, India’s most revered activist set about trying to liberate India from British rule, through what became known as the noncooperation movement.

Around 1920, Gandhi began urging all Indians to turn their backs on anything British. Civil servants abandoned government posts, Indian students left British-run universities, and civilians stayed home during the Prince of Wales’s visit in November 1921.

A charismatic young chemistry student, Khwaja Abdul Hamied, heeded Gandhi’s call. Handsome with a regal carriage, K. A. Hamied was a natural leader among his peers. He left school and went to Sabarmati, where Gandhi directed him and another student, Zakir Husain, to leave the ashram and start an Indian-run university. They did so. To the students, Gandhi was a「great prophet for the freedom of the country,」as Hamied later recalled.「His words were law unto us.」Husain would later become India’s third president. The school he helped to found, Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi, remains in operation today, with a mission statement to prepare Indian students to be masters of their own future.

In 1924, after Gandhi — fiercely committed to nonviolence — suspended his movement because of an outbreak of violence among his followers, Hamied left to study abroad. He received his doctorate in chemistry in Berlin. On a school outing to a lake, he met and fell in love with a Lithuanian Jewish girl with Communist leanings. They married in 1928 in Berlin’s only mosque. With Hitler rising to power, they headed to India, and later sponsored a dozen Jewish families to come there, saving them from almost certain death.

Back home in 1930, Hamied found a depleted and impoverished research environment, lacking even functional laboratories. The pharmaceutical market was almost entirely dominated by multinational companies, from Boots and Burroughs Wellcome to Parke Davis. With few exceptions, the Indians acted as mere distributors.

A young man with little money, Hamied dreamed of launching a grand laboratory and was finally able to found Cipla in 1935. Four years later, at the start of World War II, Gandhi visited Hamied’s manufacturing plant and wrote in the guest book,「I was delighted to visit this Indian enterprise.」But Gandhi’s visit was not just a social call. It had a vital purpose. Britain had promised India its independence, so long as Indians helped in the war effort. Part of that effort was to make medicine. While demand for medicine from the Indian army had surged, supplies from Europe’s drug makers had collapsed. Quietly, Gandhi urged Hamied to step into this void, which he did. Cipla became the largest producer of the antimalarial drug quinine and vitamin B12 for soldiers suffering from anemia.

Although Hamied lived modestly, the vagaries of Indian rent laws enabled him to lease a palatial apartment, the 7,000-square-foot ground floor of the Jassim House, in Bombay’s elegant seaside neighborhood, Cuffe Parade. There, as India’s famous freedom fighters visited the Hamied household, the children learned about the need for both political and personal independence.「If you are going to prosper in life, you have to do it yourself」was the lesson Hamied’s young son, Yusuf, gleaned from his father.

India gained independence in 1947 (Gandhi was tragically assassinated just one year later). By then, Hamied had been elected to the Bombay Legislative Council. In 1953, he was appointed sheriff of Bombay, a ceremonial role akin to the city’s leading ambassador. As politics consumed more of his time, his son Yusuf stepped up to run Cipla.

Known as Yuku to family and friends, Yusuf had his father’s keen scientific mind, striking features, intense narrow eyes, and wry smile. At eighteen, he left to study chemistry at Cambridge and earned his PhD by the time he was twenty-three.

He returned in 1960 to work at Cipla, only to run into a thicket of red tape. Indian rules stated that, because the company was publicly traded, the government had to approve the hire of anyone related to a company director and set that person’s salary. Consequently, for a year, Yuku earned nothing, and then for the next three years he made the equivalent of `$20` a month, until he could reapply to the government for a raise.

Like his father, Yuku became a voracious reader of scientific literature. He essentially taught himself how to manufacture tablets and injectable drugs. He also revolutionized the making of active ingredients, a drug’s essential components. These are often manufactured separately and sold to other pharma companies, which then add ingredients known as excipients to make a finished drug. Under Yuku’s leadership, Cipla eventually became one of India’s biggest manufacturers of bulk drugs. At the time, India followed the outdated British patent laws of 1911, which made medications in India even more expensive than in Europe. Under these laws, most pharmaceuticals were blocked for development. But Yuku found possibility in one medical area, where most of the patents had expired in the 1940s.

Looking around Bombay, with its profound poverty and exploding population, Yuku set out to develop a line of birth control medication. He offered it to the government, India’s main purchaser and distributor of medicines, for two rupees (then around 20 cents) a month. Birth control in the United States cost around `$8` a month. The government turned him down, seemingly indifferent to its population problem.

The birth control disappointment came at the same time as one of his biggest accomplishments. In 1961, he helped form the Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA), which set out to amend India’s antiquated patent laws. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was highly sympathetic and would later say at the World Health Organization in 1981:「My idea of a better ordered world is one in which medical discoveries would be free of patents and there would be no profiteering from life or death.」

The 1970 Indian Patents Act made it legal to copy an existing molecule, but illegal to copy the process by which it was made. This gave India’s chemists freedom to remake existing drugs so long as they altered the steps to formulate them. The law created fierce antagonism between India’s generic drug makers and the multinational brand-name drug companies, many of which left the Indian market.

India’s golden age of pharma began as the new patent law took effect. Indians became accomplished reverse-engineers, and their companies began not only supplying the Indian market but exporting to Africa, Latin America, Iran, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

In 1972, Yuku’s larger-than-life father, Khwaja Abdul Hamied, died, and Yuku became Cipla’s CEO. Even as he amassed wealth — buying homes, polo ponies, and art — he did not relish India’s「boom」in the same way as his peers did. All he had to do was walk outside his art-and-light-filled corporate headquarters in Mumbai to find an unignorable ocean of suffering. Millions of its residents lived in desperate slums, with no reliable access to electricity, sanitation, or food. Thousands lived on the roadside, without even a tarp over their heads.

The future he saw was one with too many people, too many diseases, and not enough medicine. It was this perspective — the world he was unable to not see — that led in large part to what happened next. It would take the son of an Indian freedom fighter and a Jewish Communist, with a background imprinted by Gandhi, to radically reimagine the horizon for Indian drug makers.

By contrast, the drug company Ranbaxy grew out of a set of values diametrically opposed to Cipla’s. Unlike Hamied, Bhai Mohan Singh was not the product of Gandhian inspiration. He was a veteran of the so-called License Raj, India’s antiquated business regime in which the government set every quota and dispensed every permit and license. The system required high-level connections and wads of rupees, not just to get licenses but to block the licenses of competitors.

Few got better results than Bhai Mohan Singh, a distinguished financier with exquisite manners, who was born in Punjab in 1917 to a wealthy Sikh family. His father had been a construction magnate. Bhai Mohan initially refused to enter the family business, but as World War II raged, his father’s company got a massive contract to build barracks for the Indian army. Bhai Mohan’s father sent his son to the Kangra valley to oversee the arrival of building supplies. More contracts followed the successful project, including one for a major highway to take British troops to the border of what was then Burma.

Through infrastructure, the family became one of the wealthiest in Punjab, and Bhai Mohan secured his place in a rarefied world. By 1946, his father had retired and transferred most of his assets to Bhai Mohan, making him a magnate. With this windfall, he formed a finance company, Bhai Traders and Financiers Pvt. Ltd., and loaned money to numerous businesses. One was a small drug distribution company called Ranbaxy & Co. Ltd.

His cousins Ranjit and Gurbax, a clothier and a pharmaceutical distributor, had started the company in 1937 (and named it by combining their two first names), with the modest goal of distributing foreign drugs in India. In 1952, after Gurbax was unable to repay the initial loan, Bhai Mohan bought the company, kept Gurbax on as president (because he was knowledgeable about the pharmaceutical trade), and incorporated in 1961. Bhai Mohan had three sons, including Parvinder. In time he would refer to Ranbaxy as his fourth.

Among Bhai Mohan’s many assets, Ranbaxy was hardly a prize. At the time, the reputation of most Indian drug companies rested on the prestige of the foreign drugs they distributed. Ranbaxy primarily distributed Japanese drugs, then held in low esteem, so its reputation suffered. Chemists mocked the company salesmen for the cheap drugs they sold.

Bhai Mohan, who had no experience with pharmaceuticals, might have turned his back on the company entirely. But when Gurbax tried to oust him from the board, the duel for corporate control — which Bhai Mohan won — piqued his interest in the industry.

If Bhai Mohan knew little about pharmaceuticals, he knew everything about besting his rivals through boardroom maneuvers and the deployment of his connections, which included government ministers and powerful bank executives. When his alliance with an Italian drug company no longer suited him, for example, he had his allies surreptitiously report the company’s legal violations to the government. The company was asked to leave the country, enabling Bhai Mohan to take over the Italian company’s shares on his own terms.

However, his mastery of the License Raj did not help him make a cutting-edge pharmaceutical company. Ranbaxy had no particular mission or vision. Nor did it have any capacity to manufacture its own products. It had a single factory that reformulated bulk drugs into tablets and capsules from raw ingredients acquired elsewhere.

Two things propelled the company into the future. In 1968, Ranbaxy had its first pharmaceutical success when it launched a generic version of Roche’s Valium under the product name Calmpose and rolled it out with a phrase from the nineteenth-century poet Ghalib:「When the day of death is set, why does sleep elude me all night?」The drug became India’s first「superbrand.」More consequential, however, was the return of Bhai Mohan’s eldest son, Parvinder. In 1967, he came back from the United States with a doctorate in pharmacy from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and immediately joined the company, bringing with him skills and a seriousness of purpose that Ranbaxy had previously lacked.

Intense and more austere than his father, Parvinder had left India a middling student, more committed to refining his golf game than applying himself to his studies. But in Michigan, he had spent day and night in the laboratory. The dean there had written to Bhai Mohan that a student like Parvinder came along only once in a decade. He had also returned with a more profound sense of his own spirituality. He married the daughter of a guru who led a spiritual organization that prohibited alcohol and meat.

Unlike his father, Parvinder believed that Ranbaxy had to achieve independence. The company could have no control of its destiny, or the quality of its products, until it could make its own active ingredients and do its own research. Both required huge infusions of capital. To finance it, Parvinder helped take the company public in 1973.

Though Parvinder envisioned Ranbaxy as a global company, the rest of the world still held a dim view of Indian medicine. In Thailand, Ranbaxy’s business was so poor that the company held a prayer ceremony with sixteen local monks to try to turn things around. The U.S. market was the world’s largest and most lucrative, but also the most difficult to enter, with the most vigilant regulators. And though Indian companies were selling active ingredients to drug companies there, finished doses were a whole other matter.

In 1987, two Ranbaxy executives traveled to the United States to gauge the possibility of exporting there. As recounted in a company-sponsored book:

They met representatives from 20 companies and all of them were bewildered to learn that an Indian company wanted to export finished formulations to the U.S. [One executive] recalls visiting a top American distributor who made him wait for two hours and then, after breaking a pencil [which had the words]「Made in Israel」[on it], he said,「Israelis are already invading the market here, and now we will have pharmaceuticals and medicines coming from India! What is the world coming to?」

However, some in the United States saw the future more clearly — and Parvinder forged alliances with them. He visited a fine chemicals importer named Agnes Varis at her Manhattan office. Varis was a firebrand and iconoclast, ahead of her time. She was one of eight children of Greek immigrants. Her father sold ice cream from a pushcart until his death, when Agnes was fourteen. Her mother, who was illiterate, sewed buttons in a garment factory. Varis got a degree in chemistry at Brooklyn College and in 1970, at age forty, launched her company, AgVar Chemicals, which brokered pharmaceutical ingredients from foreign manufacturers. Her company made millions, she became a major donor to the Democratic Party, and she was on a first-name basis with the Clintons.

Varis was immediately taken with Parvinder and his colleagues.「They were brilliant,」she recalled in 2010, the year before her death.「They were gorgeous. They dressed beautifully. Their English was perfect. I felt they were on a very high standard.」With her pharmaceutical know-how and golden Rolodex, she would become their political benefactor in their quest to sell finished doses in the United States.

Back in India, as the company drove to expand, Bhai Mohan was looking to ensure family peace. In 1989, at age seventy-one, he split the growing family businesses among his three sons, a settlement intended to ensure an amicable division before he died. He gave his eldest, Parvinder, all of his Ranbaxy shares. Manjit, the middle son, got an agrochemical company and some luxury properties. Analjit, the youngest, inherited Max India, a fine chemicals company whose biggest customer was Ranbaxy. Because Ranbaxy was the largest of the three companies, the two younger brothers inherited additional funds.

As the businesses inherited by the younger sons foundered, Manjit and Analjit grew bitter and believed that they had been shortchanged. They came to resent Parvinder, whom they viewed as the favored son. The brothers’ relationship soured to the point where Analjit believed that Ranbaxy was orchestrating secret smear campaigns against him and his company. He told his close aides that he found Parvinder cold, calculating, and emotionless.「My brother loved to push a chili up my back every day,」he recalled of his childhood.

For his part, Parvinder thrived as Ranbaxy’s managing director. In 1991, India liberalized its economy, scrapping its system of quotas and licenses and opening whole sectors of the economy to foreign investment. Parvinder intensified his focus on expanding overseas. Within the company, his reputation was towering:「He was larger than life,」one former associate remarked.「The people worshiped him. When he walked by, [employees] would bow.」

However, he and his father were soon locked in conflict. Not long after gifting Parvinder his stake in Ranbaxy, Bhai Mohan began waging a battle against him. He accused Parvinder of violating the family settlement agreement by blocking his veto power over company matters. Their conflict was not just over the internal exercise of power, but rather over two different visions — one old and one new — of India. With the economy now open to outside capital, India’s companies needed competent professionals with real skills, not just「liaison managers between the government and industrialists.」Bhai Mohan’s connections had become less important. Feeling sidelined, he openly fought with his son at board meetings.

Their biggest clash centered on a manager, Davinder Singh Brar, whom Parvinder brought into the company in 1978. Brar was a master tactician with an MBA who had become Parvinder’s indispensable deputy. As father and son battled over whether to keep Brar on, Ranbaxy’s board split their allegiances. Dozens of warring executives, some for Bhai Mohan, some for Brar, marched to the boardroom shouting competing slogans. An executive who led the pro-Brar delegation was fired by Bhai Mohan one morning but reinstated by Parvinder the same afternoon. On February 6, 1993, Manjit warned his father of plans to oust him at a board meeting that day. Bhai Mohan and his supporters resigned. Parvinder took over as Ranbaxy’s chairman and managing director, and Bhai assumed the title of chairman emeritus. Parvinder and his father never made amends. Instead, Bhai Mohan filed a lawsuit against his son for violating the terms of the inheritance settlement, a dispute that would drag on into the next generation.

By 1995, Ranbaxy was the first company in Indian pharma to get a plant approved by the FDA to make products for the U.S. market. By then, four-fifths of Ranbaxy’s sales came from abroad. Two years later, Parvinder was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. His father was so bitter that he wrote his son to say that he wouldn’t attend his funeral. (In fact, he ended up organizing it and making use of all his connections to ensure that four hundred people attended the cremation.) With Parvinder’s death in July 1999, his ownership of Ranbaxy passed to his two sons, Malvinder, age twenty-six, and Shivinder, twenty-four.

Bhai Mohan tried to draft his grandsons onto the Ranbaxy board immediately, as a way to reassert control over the company. But the spirit of Parvinder still seemed to be blocking this possibility. In his final press interview a month before his death, Parvinder insisted that his sons should only join the board once they’d gained enough professional experience to merit it. Honoring their deceased father, the brothers issued a statement saying that they would follow his wishes.

Shivinder went to work in a separate family-owned hospital business. Malvinder worked at Ranbaxy in a low-level position, making sales calls to doctors and pharmacists in small towns and villages. With his Western business education (he had attended Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business) and Indian spiritual values, Malvinder rose quickly at Ranbaxy. Meanwhile, the company was being run by the professional manager Brar, whose original tenure had precipitated the ugly fight between father and son.

Parvinder had set up Ranbaxy for a globalized world. But for all his foresight and preparation, he never could have planned what would ultimately bring the world to Ranbaxy’s doorstep. An immense crisis was looming, one that would eclipse the skills of even the most professional manager. It would require moral imagination on a vast scale — and summon Cipla’s CEO Yusuf Hamied to action.

自由战士

1920 年 | 印度古吉拉特邦艾哈迈达巴德

经有很长一段时间，很少有人肯吃印度药，更别说赞美生产这些药物的公司了。对投入几十年时间和千百万经费开发新药的品牌制药公司来说，这些复制他们产品的印度公司比小偷好不了多少。对他们不该感谢，而是应该起诉。对全世界的患者来说，「印度生产」的标签也意味地摊品质的货色，最好不要尝试。

然而，有一个男人在幕后却付出了无人可及的努力以改变这种观念，并为比尔·克林顿的到访铺平道路，他就是优素福·哈米耶德博士。在许多年里，作为印度制药巨头西普拉有限公司的事长，他生产出来的药物连印度本国政府都不愿购买，他公开提出的大胆的建议也为大多数人所无视。但他不在乎别人怎么看他。他很享受那些作为对手的品牌公司的愤怒。2001 年的天，他发表了一则声明，就此赋予了印度制药者一套全新的头衔：偶像破坏者，眼光远大的人，救世主。

不过，哈米耶德博的故事，连同印度当代制药产业的启航，其实都要追湖到一个世纪之前的一座灵修院。那不是普通的灵修院，而是圣雄甘地创立的高僧修行所，它位于今天的艾哈迈达巴，属于印度西部的古吉拉特邦。就是在那里，这位印度最受尊敬的活动家开启了将印度从英国统治下解放出来的事业，他的方式后来被称为「不合作运动」。大约在 1920 年，甘地促所有印度人放弃一切与英国有关的东西。公务员放弃了政府职位，印度学生从英国人管理的大学退学，威尔士亲王于 1921 年 11 月访问印度时，平民都待在家里回避他。

一个年轻而富于魅力的化学系学生赫瓦贾·阿ト杜·哈米耶（Khwaja  Abdul Hamied）响应了甘地的号召。他相貌英俊，一副君王气派，自然成了同辈中的领抽。他离开学校去了高僧修行所，在那里甘地吩咐他和另一名学生扎基尔·候赛因（Zakir Husin）离开修行所，去建立一座由印度人管理的大学。两人照办了。在学生们眼中，甘地是一位「争取国家自由的伟大先知」。哈米耶德后来回忆，「他的话语就是我们的法律」。侯赛因后来成为印度第三任总统。他参与创建的学校，新德里的印度国立伊斯兰大学到今天仍在运营，学校的宗旨是将印度学生培养成自己来的主人。

1924 年，因为追随者中爆发了暴力行为，恪守非暴力宗旨的甘地暂停了活动，哈米耶德也离开印度出国留学去了。他在柏林获得了化学博土学位。在学校组织的一次湖边郊游中，他认识了一位志同道合的立陶宛籍犹太女孩，两人坠入爱河。1928 年，他们在柏林唯一的一座清真寺里结了婚。希特勒掌权之后，两人回到印度，后来又赞助了 12 个犹太家庭到这里生活，帮他们脱了几乎必死的命运。

1930 年回国时，哈米耶德看到的是一个破落贫乏的研究环境，连能用的实验室也没有一间。印度的药物市场几平完全被跨国公司主宰，从博姿和宝来威康到帕克·戴维斯公司。除了极少数的例外，印度人只能做做经销商。

虽然只是个措据的年轻人，哈米耶德却梦想能成立一间大型实验室。1935 年，他终于创立了西拉公司。四年后第二次世界大战开始，甘地访问了哈米耶的生产工厂，并在宾客留言簿上写下了「我很高兴参观这家印度企业」的字样。不过，甘地的参观不仅是一次社交访问，他还带了一个重要目的而来。当时英国已经承诺让印度独立，前提是印度也要在战事中出一份力。而生产药物就是战事的一部分。当时印度军队对药物的需求激增，欧洲药厂的供应链却已崩溃。甘地悄悄地敦促哈米耶填补这片空缺，哈米耶德照办了。西拉成为奎宁和维生素 B12 的最大生产商，前者对抗疟疾，后者为士兵治疗贫血。

哈米耶虽然过着简朴的生活，但印度变幻莫测的房屋租货法却让他能出租一套宫殿般豪华的公寓，就是贾西姆之家 7000 平方英尺的底楼，位于孟买的高雅海滨社区卡夫广场区。印度著名的自由战士们会拜访哈米耶德家，家里的孩子们也懂得了政治独立和个人独立的必要性。「想在生活中成功，你就得自己争取」，这就是哈米耶德的小儿子优素福从父亲那里学到的。

印度于 1947 年取得独立（可情只过了一年，甘地就遇刺身亡）。这时的哈米耶德已经入选孟买立法会。1953 年，他被任命为孟买治安官 [5]，这是一个象征性的头衔，类似这座城市的首席大使。随着他的时间越来越多地被政治占据，他的儿子优素福承担起了管理西普拉的责任。

优素福在家人朋友之间的小名叫「优库」（Yuku），他继承了父亲做锐的科学头脑、出众的相貌、狭窄的眼睛、专注的眼神，还有的微笑。他在 18 岁那年离家去剑桥大学学习化学，23 岁就取得了博士学位。

1960 年，他回到西普拉工作，却立刻陷入错综复杂的繁文缛节之中。印度法规规定，由于西普拉是一家上市公司，它要雇任何一名高管的家属，都必须经过政府审批，家属的工资也得由政府来决定。因此在入职后的一年中，优库没有要过一分钱，在接下来的三年里，他每月的工资也只有 20 美元，在那之后才能向政府申请加薪。

和他父亲一样，优库开始如饥似渴地阅读科学文献。他基本上是自己学会了如何制作药片和注射剂。他还革新了药物基本部件 一一 有效成分的工艺。这些成分往往是分开生产的，再卖给别的药企，然后那些药企会加入名为「辅料」的成分，做成成药。在优库的领导下，西普拉最终成为印度最大的原料药生产商之一。印度当时施行的还是过时的 1911 年的英国专利法规，其药价比欧洲还昂贵。根据这些法律，大多数印度药企都被禁止开发新药。不过优库在一个医学领域找到了出路，这个领域的大多数专利在 20 世纪 40 年代就过期了。

环顾孟买，生活赤贫，人口暴涨，优库开始开发一种避孕药。在印度，政府是主要的药物采购方和经销方，他向政府出售这种药物，价格是每月 2 卢比（当时约值 20 美分）。在美国，避孕药的价格大概是每月 8 美元。但政府拒绝了他，似乎对本国的人口问题漠不关心。

在为避孕药的事失望之余，他又在别处取得了一项巨大的成就。1961 年他参与成立了印度制药商协会（缩写 IDMA），会员们开始修订印度过时的专利法规。总理英迪拉·甘地对此极为赞赏，1981 年她在世卫组织的会议上说了这样一番话：「我心目中拥有良好秩序的世界，是一个医学发现不受专利底护的世界，在那个世界，谁也不能靠生死大事牟取暴利。」

1970 年，新的《印度专利法》规定复制一种已有的分子是合法的但复制这种分子的生产过程则是非法的。印度的化学家获得了重新制作现有药物的自由，只要他们能够更改配方步骤。这部法律在印度的仿制药生产商和跨国品牌药公司之间激起了强烈对抗，许多大公司就此退出了印度市场。

随着新专利法生效，印度制药业的黄金时代开始了。印度人成了逆向工程的巧匠，印度公司不仅供应本国市场，还将产品出口到了非洲、拉丁美洲、中东和东南亚。

1972 年，优库的传奇父亲赫瓦贾·阿卜杜勒·哈米耶德谢世，优库成为西普拉公司的 CEO。他虽然也积累财富 一一 购入房产，在马球比赛上买马，收购艺术品，却不像同辈人那样欣赏印度的「繁荣」。在孟买，他只要走出公司那饰满艺术品、灯光灿烂的总部，就会看见一片不容忽视的痛苦汪洋。数百万市民生活在绝的贫民窟里，没有可靠的电力供应、卫生设备或食物。数千人就住在道路两旁，头顶甚至没有一块遮雨的油布。

展展未来，他只看见人口暴涨、疾病猖獗、药物短缺。他看到的这个世界，这个他无法忽视的世界，也在很大程度上导致了后来发生的事。这个印度自由战士的儿子，这个深受甘地影响的企业家，将为印度的制药者们重新构想出截然不同的前景。

和西普拉相比，兰伯西是在一套截然不同的价值观中成长起来的。不同于哈米耶德，巴伊·莫汉·辛格（Bhai Mohan Singh）并没有受到过甘地的感召。他是一个精通所谓「许可证制度」的老手，那是一套陈旧的商业体制由政府确定所有配额、分发所有执照和许可证。在这套体制下经商，你必须结识高层人脉，撤出去大把卢比，不仅是为了自己争得许可证，也是为了阻止竞争对手获得许可证。

在这套体制下，很少有人能比巴伊·莫汉·辛格更成功。他是一位举止得体的优秀金融家，1917 年出生在旁遮普一个富裕的锡克教家庭，父亲是一位建筑业巨头。起初，巴伊·英汉拒绝进入家族企业，但随着第二次世界大战爆发，他父亲的公司拿到了一份为印度陆军建造营房的巨额订单，父亲派他去冈格拉山谷监督接收运来的建筑材料。这个项目成功之后，更多的订单纷至来，其中包括建造一条使英国军队可以开往彼时甸边境的主要公路。

依靠基础设施建设，辛格家族成为旁遮普最富裕的家族之一，巴伊·莫汉也在富贵阶层占得一席之地。1946 年父亲退休，将大部分资产都转移到巴伊·莫汉名下，他就此成为一名大亨。靠着这笔意外之财，他成立了一家名为「巴伊交易融资私营有限公司」的金融企业，开始向许多企业提供贷款。其中一家是做药物经销的小企业，名叫「兰伯西有限公司」。

巴伊·莫汉有两个堂兄弟，兰吉特（Rani）和顾伯西（Cuban），一个做服装布料生意，一个做药物经销。两人在 1937 年创立了兰伯西公司（公司名就是两人名字的合成）。他们的目标不大，只想在印度经销外国药物。1952 年，顾伯西还不上最初的贷款，巴伊·莫汉于是收购了公司，留下顾伯西做董事长（因为他对药物买卖非常熟悉），新公司于 1961 年注册成立。巴伊·莫汉有三个儿子，帕温德就是其中之一。日后他将会把兰伯西称为自己的第四个儿子。

在巴伊·莫汉的众多资产中，兰伯西并不算贵重。那时候，大部分印度药企的名声都取决于它们经销的外国药物的名声。兰伯西经销的主要是日本药，在当时评价很低，公司的名望因而很差。因为销售廉价药物，公司的推销员们还受到过化学家的嘲。

伊·莫汉对药物毫无经验，本可以对公司完全放手。但是当顾伯西试图将他逐出董事会时，巴伊·莫汉却在争公司控制权的斗争（他赢了）中对这个行业燃起了兴趣。

虽说巴伊·莫汉对药物知道得不多，他对另一些事却了如指掌：如何在董事会耍手腕赢过对手，如何在各处部署亲信，包括政府部长和手握大权的银行高管。例如，当公司和一家意大利药企的结盟不再让他满意时，他让其他盟友向政府秘密举报了那家药企的违法行为。那家公司被勒令退出印度，莫汉得以照自己的条件收购其股份。

不过，对许可证制度的熱悉并没有帮助他建立一家领先的制药企业。兰伯西没有什么明确的使命或者愿景。它也没有能力生产自己的产品。它是有一家工厂，只能将别处买来的原料制成药片和胶囊。

有两件事为公司开辟了未来的道路。1968 年，兰伯西取得了药领域的第一次成功，公司仿制了罗氏公司的安定 [13]，取名「Calmpose」，并用 19 世纪诗人迦利布的一句名言作为宣传语：「既然死期已经注定，我为什么还整夜睡不着呢？」Calmpose 成为印度的第一个「超级品牌」。然而意义更为重大的一件事却是巴伊·莫汉的长子 一一 帕温德的归来。1967 年，他从美国位于安娜堡的密歌根大学获得药学博士学位归来，立刻加入了兰伯西公司，他带回的技能和认真迫求目标的精神，都是当时的兰伯西所缺乏的。

温德这个人富有激情，生活比父亲简朴，离开印度时成绩中等。比起学习，他更专注于提高自己的高尔夫球技术。但是在密歇根大学，他却夜以继日地扑在实验室里。学校的系主任曾写信给巴伊·莫汉，说像帕温德这样的学生 10 年才出得了一个。他回到印度时，对自己的灵性也有了更深刻的理解。他娶了一个灵性导师的女儿为妻，岳父领导着一个灵修团体，内部禁止饮酒吃肉。

和父亲不同，帕温德认为兰伯西必须取得独立。如果公司不能自主生产有效成分并且开展研究，它就无法掌握自身的命运或自家产品的品质。而生产有效成分和开展研究都需要投入大量资本。为了获得资金，帕温德在 1973 年推动了公司上市。

虽然帕温德设想将兰伯西塑造成一家全球企业，但世界其他地方对印度的医药仍不看好。在泰国，兰伯西的生意差得不行，以至于公司举办了一场祷仪式，雇了当地 16 名僧人诵经，希望能使局面好转。美国是全世界规模最大、利润最高的市场，也是监管最谨慎、最难进入的市场。虽然印度已经在向美国的药企出售有效成分，但成品药就完全是另一回事了。

1987 年，兰伯西的两名高管前往美国，考察向美国出口的可能性。公司赞助的一本书对此做了记述：

他们会见了 20 家公司的代表，在听说一家印度公司希望向美国出口成品药时，所有人都觉得诧异。公司的一位高管回忆他去拜访一位顶级美国经销商，对方让他等了两小时，还折断了一支标着「以色列生产」的铅笔说：「以色列人已经在入侵这里的市场，现在连印度都要来卖药！这个世界到底怎么了？」

不过，也有一些美国人更清楚地看见了未来 —— 帕温德也和他们结成盟友。他拜访了一位名叫阿格尼丝·瓦里斯（Agnes Varis）的精细化学品进口商，地点在她位于曼哈顿的办公室。瓦里斯喜欢制造麻烦，打破偶像，走在时代的前面。她的父母是希腊移民，家里兄弟姐妹有八个。她父亲用推车卖冰激凌，直到他死的那一天还在工作，当时阿格尼丝 14 岁她母亲不识字，在一家成衣厂里缝扣子。瓦里斯在布鲁克林学院取得了化学学位。1970 年，40 岁的她成立了自己的公司 一一 阿格瓦化学公司，为外国的生产商代理出售药物成分。她的公司赚了数百万美元，她也成为民主党的重要捐款人，和克林顿夫妇是彼此直呼其名的交情。

瓦里斯一见面就喜欢上了帕温德和他的同事。「他们都很聪明。」她在 2010 年，也就是去世的前一年回忆说，「模样也都很好，穿着漂亮的衣服。英语好得不得了。我感觉他们都是很有档次的人。」凭借她的药物知识和高级人脉，瓦里斯做了这几个人的政治恩主，帮他们求得了在美国销售成品药的机会。

回到印度，随着公司的扩张，巴伊·莫汉也在努力维持着家庭的和平。1989 年，72 岁的他将不断增长的家族产业分给了三个儿子，希望以此确保他们能在他死前友好分家。他给了长子帕温德兰伯西的全部股份；二儿子曼吉特（Manjit）分到了一家农用化学品公司和一些奢侈品；小儿子阿纳吉特（Analjit）继承了麦克斯印度，那是一家精细化学品公司，最大的客户就是兰伯西。因为兰伯西是三家公司中最大的，两个弟弟还另外继承了几个基金。

后来两个弟弟继承的企业经营失败，曼吉特和阿纳吉特心生怨念，认为自己在分家时吃了亏。他们开始怨根帕温德，认为他受到父亲的偏祖。兄弟的感情不断恶化，到后来阿纳吉特甚至认为兰伯西策划了针对他和他公司的诽谤行动。他告诉一个亲信，他觉得帕温德冷酷、精于算计、没有感情。他还回忆童年说：「小时候我哥哥每天都在我背上抹辣椒。」

在帕温德方面，出任兰伯西总经理的他事业蒸蒸日上。1991 年，印度对经济做了自由化改革，废弃了配额和许可证制度，各经济部门完全向外国投资开放。帕温德更加集中精力推行海外扩张。在公司内部，他的声望也如日中天。「他成了传奇人物。」一位前合伙人说，「在这里人人崇拜他，他所到之处，员工都会鞠躬。」

然而，他和他父亲很快陷入冲突。在将自己的兰伯西股份赠予帕温德不久后，巴伊·莫汉就对儿子发起了斗争。他谴责帕温德违背家庭协议，阻止自己对公司事务行使一票否决权。两人的冲突不仅关公司内部的权力行使，还关乎对愿景的两种看法，一个旧，一个新。现在印度经济已经对境外资本开放，印度公司需要的是有真才实学的专业人士，而不仅仅是「政府和实业家之间的联络人」。巴伊·莫汉的人脉变得不那么重要了。他感觉自己受了冷落，于是在董事会上公然和儿子吵了起来。

他们最大的冲突集中在一位经理身上，达温德·辛格·布拉尔，此人是帕温德在 1978 年招进公司的。布拉尔是一位谋略大师，拥有 MBA 学位，当时已成为帕温德不可或缺的副手。父子两为布拉尔的去留产生冲突，兰伯西的事会也分成了两个派系。几十名高管中，有人支持巴伊·莫汉，有人支持布拉尔，他们行进到董事会的会议室里竞相呼喊口号。一天早晨，布拉尔派系的一位领头高管被巴伊·英汉开除，但当天下午帕温德就恢复了他的职位。1993 年 2 月 6 日，曼吉特提醒父亲，有人计划在那天的董事会议上驱逐他。巴伊·莫汉和他的支持者索性辞职。帕温德接任兰伯西的董事长兼总经理，巴伊·英汉保留了名誉事长头行。父子两人的关系始终没有得到修复。巴伊莫汉对儿子提起诉讼，控告他违背继承协议的条款，这场诉讼将一直延续到下一代人身上。

1995 年，兰伯西成为第一家获美国药监局批准为美国市场生产产品的印度药企。到这时，兰伯西的销量已经有五分之四来自海外了。两年后，帕温德被诊断得了食管癌。他的父亲怨念未消，甚至写信给儿子说自己不会参加他的葬礼。（但实际上，他最后不仅组织了葬礼，还发动所有关系请了 400 人参加火化仪式。）1999 年 7 月，帕温德病逝，他对兰伯西的所有权被移交给了两个儿子，26 岁的马尔文德和 24 岁的施文德（Shivinder）。

巴伊·莫汉想让两个孙子立刻进入兰伯西董事会，好借此重新掌权。然而帕温德的精神似乎还在阻止这种可能。帕温德在他病逝前的一个月接受最后的媒体采访时，坚持他的儿子只有积累了相应的职业经验之后才能加入董事会。为了纪念亡父，兄弟俩也声明会遵从他的遗愿。

施文德去了另一家家族所有的医院工作。马尔文德进了兰伯西，从低阶职位做起，负责给小镇和村庄的医生和药剂师打电话推销产品。因为受过西方商业教育（他念的是杜克大学的富卡商学院），又熟悉印度的灵性价值，马尔文德在兰伯西升得很快。这时管理公司的仍是职业经理人布拉尔，之前正是他的任职问题加剧了那场父子间的恶斗。

帕温德原本计划将兰伯西打造成顺应全球化潮流的公司。然而尽管他富有远见并且做了心理准备，也绝料不到最终将世界带到兰伯西门前的会是什么。一场巨大的危机正在迫近，就连最专业的经理人也将无计可施。它需要人们在极大的尺度上运用道德想象力，同时它还会促使西普拉公司的 CEO 优素福·哈米耶德采取行动。

## 0202. One Dollar a Day

1986 | Mumbai, India

Dr. Yusuf Hamied of Cipla was a prolific reader of medical journals, with an annual subscription budget that topped `$150,000`. One day in 1986, he was introduced to something he knew nothing about. A colleague mentioned,「According to the Tufts report, AZT is the only drug available for AIDS.」

「What is AIDS?」Dr. Hamied responded.

Just five years earlier, in 1981, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported the emergence of a rare cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma, among clusters of young gay men in San Francisco and New York. The following year, doctors and the media gave the puzzling ailment the misleading shorthand name GRID (gay-related immune deficiency). In Africa, doctors confronting a mysterious wasting syndrome called the disease「Slim.」By the summer of 1982, the CDC had connected these dots, identifying acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its precursor, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

At the time of Dr. Hamied’s question, the disease had barely surfaced in most of India. But it was brewing so forcefully in Bombay’s red-light district, not far from Cipla’s headquarters, that within a few years Hamied’s own city would earn the moniker「AIDS Capital of India.」

Within a decade, AIDS was destroying Africa. More than five thousand people a day were dying. In certain African countries, one-quarter of the population was infected. In some local communities, the biggest industry was making wooden coffins. Africa was becoming a continent of orphans, the number of children without parents doubling every year. The disease was projected to kill up to 90 million Africans by 2025.

In 1991, Dr. Rama Rao, the research head of an Indian government laboratory, told Hamied that he had developed a chemical synthesis of AZT, or azidothymidine, and wanted Cipla to manufacture it. It was the only drug that postponed the onset of AIDS. But just one company, Burroughs Wellcome in the United States, made it, and it was selling the drug at roughly `$8,000` per patient a year. Hamied readily agreed to manufacture it and launched the drug in 1993 at less than one-tenth of the international price, or about `$2` a day. Even that price was still well beyond what most Indians could afford.「Our sales were zero,」Hamied recalled.

At that point, Hamied asked the government if it could purchase and distribute the drug. But the Indian government refused: it had money only for detection and prevention, not treatment. In total disgust, Hamied ended up discarding 200,000 capsules. With the stigma surrounding AIDS, he had no one to sell them to — or even give them to.

A few years later, Hamied read in a medical journal that a cocktail of three drugs called HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) was effective in controlling AIDS. The three drugs in question — stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine — were made by three different multinational drug companies. The combined price for a single patient reached `$12,000` a year. Not only was the treatment regimen onerous, but few could afford it. Hamied immediately set out to make the drugs in the cocktail.

In 1997, under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, South Africa altered its law to make it easier to sidestep pharmaceutical patents and import low-cost medicine. No country needed the AIDS cocktail more badly than South Africa, which had emerged as an epicenter of the epidemic. But South Africa, along with over 130 nations, was bound by an international trade agreement called TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights), which required that all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ensure basic protection for intellectual property.

South Africa’s new law sparked a furious reaction from Big Pharma. Fearing a domino effect, thirty-nine international brand-name drug companies, with the support of the U.S. government, sued South Africa, claiming that the new health law violated the TRIPS agreement. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of South Africa, representing Big Pharma, rolled out newspaper ads with an image of a crying baby, warning that the law would allow「counterfeit, fake, expired and harmful medicines」into the market. Brand-name drug companies closed factories and withdrew from the country, with the claim that South Africa was intent on destroying international treaties.

It was a deadly global stalemate. As drug companies skirmished over intellectual property, 24 million people got sicker, with no foreseeable access to the affordable medicine they so desperately needed. On August 8, 2000, Hamied got a call from an activist in the United States whom he had never met.「Me and some of my colleagues would like to come see you,」said the man on the phone. It was William F. Haddad, the expletive-spouting former investigative journalist who had campaigned so vigorously for the Hatch-Waxman Act, the law that launched the U.S. generic drug industry.

He had gotten Hamied’s name from Agnes Varis, who told him,「He’s a brilliant chemist. And he’s not frightened by the multinationals.」The colleagues Haddad referred to were a motley group of activists who had banded together in pursuit of a single objective — to find a way to get affordable AIDS medicine to those who needed it most, free from the stranglehold of patents. Jamie Packard Love, an intellectual-property activist, had helped advise the South African government on amending and defending its new patent law. In the United States, he had set out to learn the real cost of manufacturing the drugs, and nobody seemed to know.「If it was 40 million white people that were going to die, somebody would know the answer to that question,」Love recalled.

Four days after contacting Hamied, Bill Haddad, Jamie Love, and three others, including a French doctor with the group Doctors Without Borders, arrived at the elegant London duplex where Hamied sat out the brutal Indian summer. He led them up the stairs to a glass dining table. Surrounded by costly art, including a work from one of India’s most famous artists, M. F. Husain, and overlooking the exclusive Gloucester Square garden, they asked him: how low could he price the AIDS cocktail, and how much of it could he make?

As they spoke, Hamied scrawled calculations with a pencil and paper. He concluded that he could cut his price by more than half, to about `$800` a year. The men talked into the night, and the group vowed that they would support Hamied in the inevitable battles with the multinational drug companies that lay ahead. Together, an Indian drug maker and international activists had forged an extraordinary alliance, pledging to upend the established global commercial and pharmaceutical order in order to save millions of lives.

About a month later, in part through their efforts, Hamied received an invitation to speak at the European Commission’s conference in Brussels on HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and poverty reduction. He readily accepted and was given three minutes for his address. On September 28, 2000, he took to the podium and looked out over the gathering of staid, skeptical — and white — Europeans, who included health ministers, ex–prime ministers, and representatives of multinational drug companies.「Friends,」he told the unfriendly group,「I represent the third world. I represent the needs and aspirations of the third world. I represent the capabilities of the third world, and above all, I represent an opportunity.」

He then proceeded to unveil three offers: he would sell the AIDS cocktail for `$800` a year (`$600` to governments buying in bulk); give the technology to make the drugs free to any African government willing to produce its own drugs; and provide nevirapine, the drug that limited transmission of the disease from mother to child, for free. He was literally slashing his own prices before their eyes. He closed with a challenge:「We call upon the participants of this conference to do what their conscience dictates.」

Hamied had been expecting a pharmaceutical revolution as governments embraced his offer. The world did not often hear the word「discount,」let alone「free,」attached to expensive medicine. But he finished to a stone-silent room. No one took him up on his proposal. Partly, this was because Hamied was offering discounted medicine in the middle of a minefield. The global pharmaceutical marketplace was intersected by patents and trade agreements, which precluded many countries from reaching out for cheap medicine. But the other problem was credibility. Much of the world viewed Indian generics as poor-quality knockoffs, a perception that Hamied had labored against for years.

In 2000, that perception led New York Times reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. to India to try to reconcile these conflicting views. He’d heard from officials at Doctors Without Borders that some Indian manufacturers were producing high-quality drugs at a fraction of the cost. Which was true? Fly-by-night counterfeiter or quality discounter? Hamied offered McNeil full access to his operations and laboratories. The resulting article, a detailed profile of the Cambridge-educated chemist, ran on the front page of the New York Times and introduced Western readers to a new concept: counter to the claims of brand-name companies, costly drugs could actually be made reliably for pennies.

On January 26, 2001, one of the most devastating earthquakes ever recorded rocked the western state of Gujarat. It killed 20,000 people and injured 160,000 more. The world scrambled to respond. Bill Clinton, who’d just left office, raised money and traveled to India to offer aid. Dr. Hamied opened his warehouses and donated vast amounts of medicine. But for him, the event was a different sort of wake-up call. As the world scrambled to save the victims trapped under buildings or left homeless, Hamied realized that AIDS dwarfed the Gujarat earthquake by orders of magnitude. He decided then that he could not simply wait for governments to take him up on the offer he’d made in Brussels.

Just as he was pondering his next steps, the way forward presented itself. A few days after the earthquake, William Haddad called Hamied back, this time with a specific question. Would Cipla be able to offer the AIDS cocktail for `$1` a day? After some back-of-the-envelope calculations, Hamied agreed. He would offer the price exclusively to Doctors Without Borders. It was a number low enough to be world-changing.

On February 6, 2001, at around midnight, Hamied was at a dinner party in Mumbai when his cell phone rang. The caller was the New York Times reporter Donald McNeil.「Dr. Hamied, is it true you offered `$1` a day [to Doctors Without Borders]?」McNeil asked him. Once Hamied confirmed this, McNeil laughed aloud:「Dr. Hamied, your life will not be the same from tomorrow.」

McNeil’s story was published the next morning on the front page of the Times. According to the article, Cipla was offering to sell the AIDS cocktail for `$350` a year per patient, or roughly `$1` a day, as compared to Western prices of between `$10,000` and `$15,000` a year, but was being blocked by the multinational drug makers that held the patents, who were being backed by the Bush administration. McNeil’s story「completely broke the dikes,」Jamie Love recalled.

Papers all over the world picked it up. News of Big Pharma’s patent protection efforts in the face of the global pandemic and the Bush administration’s support of them sparked international outrage and stoked street protests from Philadelphia to Pretoria, even accusations of genocide. The result was a PR debacle for Big Pharma. Even among the industry’s lowest moments — the illegal marketing of drugs for off-label uses; the payoffs to doctors who acted as promotional mouthpieces; the concealment of negative safety data for high-profile drugs — its stance in South Africa seemed uniquely horrible. As the Wall Street Journal summed it up:「Can the pharmaceuticals industry inflict any more damage upon its ailing public image? Well, how about suing Nelson Mandela?」

It was an outrage that William Haddad would never forget.「Big Pharma, those cock-sucking bastards,」he yelled to a journalist years later.「Thirty-four million people had AIDS and every single one of them would die without the medicine. Would die and were dying. And they charged `$15,000` dollars a year, and only four thousand people [in Africa] could afford the medicine.」

The disgust was mutual. As GlaxoSmithKline’s CEO Jean-Pierre Garnier declared of Cipla and the Indian generics companies at a 2001 health care forum,「They are pirates. That’s about what they are. They have never done a day of research in their lives.」Some in Big Pharma accused Hamied of trying to grab market share in Africa, to which he responded:「I am accused of having an ulterior motive. Of course I have an ulterior motive: before I die, I want to do some good.」

On March 5, 2001, as Big Pharma’s legal case against the South African government began in Pretoria, people rallied against the drug companies all over the world. In South Africa, demonstrators marched outside the high court in Pretoria. In Britain, they picketed GlaxoSmithKline plants. In the United States, AIDS activists held rallies in major cities.

Hamied and the activists prevailed. The following month, the multinational drug companies announced that they would drop their lawsuit and waive their patents so that generic fixed-dose combinations of the AIDS cocktail could be sold cheaply in Africa. In August, Cipla announced that its scientists had succeeded in creating Triomune, a single pill containing the unwieldy AIDS cocktail. To do so, Cipla had skirted Western patent laws, since the three drugs were made by different manufacturers, under separate patents, and could not legally be copied for years.

The Clinton Foundation stepped in and hammered out a deal in which Indian drug makers agreed to slash their prices even further, to 38 cents a day, in exchange for guaranteed large-volume purchases from African governments. The foundation even brought in process chemists to help the companies find ways to reduce the number of steps required to manufacture the drugs, which also brought down costs.

However, it was the `$1 `a day figure that changed the calculus of the West — from「we can’t afford to help」to「we can’t afford not to.」The AIDS activists had not counted on President George W. Bush as an ally. But on January 28, 2003, he stunned them by announcing in his State of the Union address a new program that would spend `$15` billion on AIDS drugs over five years. He explained that the dramatic drop in costs「places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. . . . Seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.」The program, which still operates today, was named PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). Finally, the world, in its halting way, had caught up to the revolution that Hamied had launched.

For Big Pharma, PEPFAR was a nightmare scenario: a U.S.-taxpayer-funded effort to spend billions on generics bound for Africa. Just days after Bush unveiled the plan, some CEOs of multinational drug companies petitioned the White House to undo the commitment of the `$1 `a day cost. The answer was no. As a concession, however, Bush allowed the group to choose the head of PEPFAR. To the dismay of AIDS activists, they installed Randall Tobias, the former CEO of the drug company Eli Lilly.

Beyond the problem of cost, another question still loomed: quality. How could the West guarantee the quality of all the AIDS drugs it was buying for Africa? The generics advocates turned to the World Health Organization, which agreed to serve as an international clearinghouse for quality generics. It would inspect companies that wanted to sell AIDS drugs internationally and, if approved, would add those names to a prequalified list. But this solution didn’t satisfy everyone. Suddenly, under Tobias’s leadership, PEPFAR introduced a new requirement: any AIDS drugs being purchased for sale to Africa with U.S. taxpayer dollars had to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The requirement triggered an avalanche of criticism. To AIDS activists, this was the ultimate bait-and-switch. Most of the Indian companies had never gotten FDA approval for any of their drugs. Activists suspected that this was a needless safeguard whose real purpose was to funnel money to Big Pharma and keep out generic manufacturers. They gained powerful adherents. In March 2004, six senators, including John McCain (R-AZ) and Ted Kennedy (D-MA), wrote a biting letter to President Bush, arguing that FDA approval would needlessly delay access to drugs and that the WHO’s standards「meet or exceed those used by respected regulatory agencies around the world.」In an obvious dig at Big Pharma, the senators wrote,「We question the purpose behind the Administration’s duplicative process being developed to review the safety and efficacy of generic drugs.」According to a former White House aide, even President Clinton called President Bush to explain that WHO approval had satisfied his foundation.

But the requirement for FDA review had not simply been a cynical advancement of Big Pharma’s interests. Inside the Bush administration, not everyone felt so sanguine about the quality of Indian generics. In a series of tense meetings at the White House and at the FDA, officials wrestled with the question of how to verify the quality of the drugs they would procure. They were bitterly divided.「We thought it would be a terrible ugly thing for U.S. taxpayers to buy subpotent, contaminated drugs for AIDS [in Africa],」recalled Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was then director of medical policy development at the FDA and today is its commissioner.「There was a lot of pressure to buy Indian counterfeit drugs,」he recalled to a journalist, years prior to becoming commissioner, adding,「I call them counterfeits, everyone else calls them generics.」

Finally, in the face of intense bipartisan pressure, a compromise emerged. The FDA created an accelerated review process for PEPFAR drugs, resulting in a perceived win for public health. Affordable generic drugs available in Africa would have the benefit of FDA review. On May 27, 2005, Ranbaxy became the first Indian generics company to get approval from the PEPFAR program for one of its AIDS drugs. Many other companies followed.

Some of the world’s poorest people owe their lives to Dr. Hamied. However, his revolution came with an unintended consequence. As more Indian companies got approval from the FDA to sell their drugs in Africa, this led to a realization that would in short order upend the generic drug industry and transform the American drug supply: if Indians could make affordable medicine good enough to be approved by American regulators, then the drugs were good enough for Americans to take too.

每天一美元

1986 年 | 印度孟买

西普拉的优素福·哈米耶德博士喜欢阅读各类医学期刊，每年的订阅费用超过 15 万美元 [1]。1986 年的一天，有人向他介绍了一件闻所未闻的事。一个同事说道：「塔夫茨大学的那份报告说，齐多夫定（AZT）是唯一可以治疗艾滋病的药物。」「艾滋病是什么？」哈米耶德博士问他。

仅仅五年前的 1981 年，美国疾病控制与预防中心（缩写 CDC，以下简称美国疾控中心）报告了一种见的癌症 一一 卡波西肉瘤（Kaposi's  sarcoma），患者都是旧金山和组约的年轻男同性恋者。翌年，医生和媒体给这种令人困惑的疾病起了一个误导性的简称 ——  GRID（gay related immune  deficiency，与男同性恋有关的免疫缺陷）。在非洲，医生们也遭遇了一种神秘的衰竭综合征，他们称之为「病」。到了 1982 年夏季，美国疾控中心终于将这些线索串联起来，确认了获得性免疫缺陷综合征（艾滋病），并认定病因为人类免疫缺陷病毒（HIV）。

当哈米耶德问到艾滋病是什么时，这种疾病在度的大部分地区还没有浮出水面。但是就在离西普拉总部不远的地方，它正在孟买的红灯区里强势酝酸，不出几年工夫，这座哈米耶德的家乡城市就将获得「印度艾滋病之都」的绰号。

不到 10 年的时间，艾滋病已经开始推毁非洲了。它每天造成 5000 人死亡。在几个非洲国家，有四分之一的人口受到感染。在当地的一些社区，制作木头棺材成了最大的产业。非洲正在变成一片孤儿的大陆，失去双亲的儿童每年都在成倍增长。据估计，到 2025 年，这种疾病将会死 9000 万非洲人。

1991 年，一家印度政府实验室的研究主任罗摩·拉奥（Rama Rao）博士告诉哈米耶德，他开发出了齐多夫定的化学合成物，希望能由西普拉公司生产。这是唯一能够延缓艾滋病发病的药物。但当时只有一家公司，即美国的宝来威康在生产它，每个患者每年要花 8000 美元左右购买这种药。哈米耶德爽快地答应了，并在 1993 年将新药投放市场，药价不到国际价格的十分之一，患者每天只要约 2 美元。然而这个价格仍然超过了大多数印度人的承受范围。「我们一片也没卖出去。」哈米耶德回忆说。

增哈米耶德又去问政府能否购买并发行这种药物。但印度政府拒绝了：政府经费只够检查和预防，治疗是不够的。哈米耶德感到无比沮丧，将 20 万枚胶囊尽数丢弃。由于大家都耻于承认得了艾滋病，他的药无法卖给任何人，甚至送也送不出去。

又过了几年，哈米耶德在一份医学期刊上读到了一种名为「HAART」（「高效抗逆转录病毒治疗」之简称）的药物，它是一种由三种药物组成的鸡尾酒似的药物，能够有效地控制艾滋病。这三种药物是司他夫定（stavudine）、拉米夫定（lamivudine）和奈韦拉平（nevirapine），分别由三家不同的跨国药企生产。每位患者购买三种药物的总花费达到每年 1.2 万美元。这种治疗方案不仅麻烦，而且没几个人负担得起。哈米耶德立即着手生产「鸡尾酒」中的几种药物。

1997 年，在纳尔逊·曼德拉（Nelson Mandela）领导下的南非修改了法律，以便绕开药物专利，进口低价药物。此时的南非已经成为艾滋病的核心灾区，没有哪个国家比它更迫切地需要这种鸡尾酒疗法。但是和其他 130 多个国家一样，南非也受制于一个名为 TRIPS（全称 Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights，即与贸易有关的知识产权）的国际贸易协定，它要求世卫组织的所有成员要有对知识产权的基本保障。

南非修改法案的做法激起了大型药企的强烈反应。因为生怕引起连锁效应，39 家品牌药企在美国政府的支持下起诉南非，号称这部新的卫生法违背了 TRIPS 协定。代表大型药企利益的南非制药商协会也在报纸上打出广告。登了一幅儿哭泣的照片，旁边的文字警告说这部法律将允许「伪造、虚假、过期和有害的药物」进入市场。品牌药企纷纷关闭工厂，退出南非，还扔下活说这个国家有意破坏国际协定。

这是一场全球范围的致命僵局。药企之间因为知识产权问题产生小规模冲突，而 2400 万人民的病情越来越重，他们迫切需要负担得起的药物，却看不到任何希望。2000 年 8 月 8 日，哈米耶接到电话，对方是一位他素未谋面的美国活动家。「我和几个同事想来见见你。」那个男人在电话里说。他正是廉·F.哈达德，那个满口脏话的前调查记者，曾极力推动《哈奇-事克斯曼法）的产生，正是这部法律启动了美国仿制药产业。

他是通过阿格尼丝·瓦里斯得知哈米耶德这个名字的。「他是个才华横溢的化学家，他不怕那些跨国企业。」瓦里斯这样评价。哈达德所说的「同事」指的是一群形形色色的活动家，他们因为一个共同的目标而团结在一起摆脱专利的束缚，将平价抗艾滋病药物带给那些最要的人。其中杰米·帕特里克·洛夫（Jamie Packard Love）是一名知识产权活动家，他曾为南非政府修订并维护新专利法出谋划策。他在美国打听药物生产的真实成本，但好像谁都不了解情况。落夫回忆当时的情况时说：「如果要死的是 4000 万白人，肯定会有人知道这个题的答案。」

在和哈米耶德取得联系后的第四天，比尔·哈达德、杰米·洛夫和另外三人 —— 其中包括无国界医生组织的一名法国医生，共同来到伦一处优雅的复式住宅，会见在那里躲避印度酷暑的哈米耶德。哈米耶德领着他们走上楼梯，来到一张玻璃餐桌前。四壁都是昂贵的艺术品，其中的一件出自印度最著名的艺术家 M.F.侯赛因（M. F. Husain），窗外可以俯散格洛斯特广场的专属花园。来访者问道：他的艾滋病鸡尾酒价格可以低到多少？又能够生产多少？

说话间，哈米耶德用一支铅笔在纸上匆匆计算。他最后说道，价格可以砍掉一半以上，减到每年 800 美元左右。几个人从白天谈到夜里，客人们许诺会在这场不可避免的战斗中支持哈米耶德，共同击退挡在前面的跨国药企。就这样，一个印度制药商和一群国际活动家组成了一个非凡的联盟，他们将颠覆现有的全球商业及药物秩序，拯救千百万苍生。

大概一个月后，部分是因为盟友们的努力，哈米耶德受受邀在欧盟委员会的布鲁塞尔会议上演讲，会议主题是 HIV / 艾滋病、疟疾、肺结核以及减少贫困。他爽快地接受了邀请，并获得三分钟的演讲时间。2000 年 9 月 28 日，他站上讲合，面对一众保守、杯疑的欧洲白人，其中有卫生部长、前首相，还有跨国药企的代表们。「朋友们，」他对不友善的听众说道，「我代表的是第三世界，代表的是第三世界的需求和愿意，代表的是第三世界的能力。最重要的是，我代表了一个机会。」

接着他宣布了三项提议：第一，他将以每年 800 美元的价格出售艾滋病鸡尾酒（政府批量采购的话，可以降到 600 美元）；第二，他将把生产这些药物的技术免费赠送给想自己生产的非洲政府；第三，他将免费提供控制艾滋病母婴传播的药物奈韦拉平。最后，他以激将法结束了演讲：「我们呼呼这次会议的参与者都听从良心的召唤。」

哈米耶德以为各国政府会接受他的提议，由此起一场药物革命。世人很少听到品贵的药物前面加上「折扣」的字样，更别说「免费」了。但是当他结束演讲，面对的却是死一般寂静的听众。没有人讨论他的提议。部分是因为哈米耶德是在一片地雷中提出打折药建议的。当时各种专利保护和贸易协定将全球药物市场切割开来，许多国家追求便宜药物受到了阻碍。另一个问题是信用：许多国家都把印度仿制药视作质量低劣的冒牌货，这也是多年来哈米耶德一直在努力纠正的偏见。

2000 年，这个偏见把《纽约时报》的记者小唐纳德·麦克尼尔（Donald C. Mcneil I.）吸引到了印度，他想调和两种相互矛盾的说法：他通过无国界医生组织的几个干事得知，有些印度企业正在生产高品质的药物，售价仅是品牌药的零头。印度的制药企业到底是什么？是不守信用的造假者，还是确保品质的折扣商？哈米耶德向麦克尼尔完全散开他的工厂和实验室。最后麦克尼尔在一篇特写中详细介绍了这位出身剑桥的化学家，文章登上《约时报》头版，并将一个新的观念介绍给了西方的读者们：和品牌药企业宣称的不同，昂贵的药物确实可以用低廉的成本可靠地生产出来。

2001 年 1 月 26 日，印度西部的古吉拉特邦发生了一场史上罕见的剧烈地震。2 万人在地震中死亡，16 万多人受伤。外界仓促应对。刚刚卸任的比尔·克林顿发起募款，并亲自去印度提供援助。哈米耶德博土也打开仓库，捐出大量药物。但对他来说，这次事件也是另一种提醒。当国内外忙乱地营救被压在房屋下或者家园被毁的难民时，哈米耶德意识到艾滋病的杀伤力比地震高出了几个数量级。那时他打定主意，不能消极地等待各国政府接受他在布鲁塞尔提出的建议。

正当他在认真思考下一步的行动时，出路却自动出现了。地震的几天后，威廉·哈达德就给哈米耶德回了电话，这一次他提出一个具体的问题：西普拉公司能否以每天一美元的价格生产艾滋病鸡尾酒？哈米耶德简单计算了一下，说没问题。他会用这个价格独家向无国界医生组织提供药物。这样低的价格，足以改变世界了。

2001 年 2 月 6 日，大约午夜时分，正在孟买参加一场晚宴的哈米耶德的手机响了。打来电话的是《组约时报》的记者小唐纳德·麦克尼尔。「哈米耶德博士，您真的要以每天一美元的价格向无国界医生组织供货吗？」麦克尼尔问他。在哈米耶德确认之后，麦克尼尔大笑起来：「哈米耶德博士，明天一早，您的人生就将不同了。」

麦克尼尔的报道刊登在次日一早的《纽约时报》头版。报道中写道，西普拉公司提议以每位患者每年 350 美元的价格出售艾滋病鸡尾酒，也就是每天一美元，而这些药物在西方的价格是每年 1 万至 1.5 万美元。他还写道西普拉的计划正被拥有专利的跨国药企所阻挡，那些药企的背后则有布什政府撑腰。杰米·洛夫回忆说，克尼尔的报道「起了一场洪水」。

全世界的报纸都做了跟进报道。大型药企面对全球瘟疫仍在保护专利而布什政府居然还给他们撑腰。这些新闻激起了世界各国人民的愤慨，从费城到比勒陀利亚，人们纷纷上街抗议，甚至责这是一场种族屠杀。这是场大型药企的公关溃败。制药业曾闹出过各种丑闻：非法销售标签外使用的药物，花钱雇医生给药品做宣传，隐对著名药物不利的安全数据。但哪一次都比不上那些药企对南非的立场这么恐怖。就像《华尔街日报》总结的那样：「制药业还要怎么进一步破坏其糟糕的公众形象呢？哦，不如去起诉纳尔逊曼德拉？」

这种令人愤慨的行径，威廉·哈达德永远也忘不了。「那些大型药企都是狗杂种王八蛋！」好几年后他还对一个记者嚷嚷，「世界上有 3400 万艾滋病患者，没有了药，他们统统都会死。有的人马上会死，有的人迟早会死。那些大公司开价每年 1.5 万美元，全非洲只有 4000 人吃得起药。」

这份厌恶是相互的。2001 年，葛兰素史克公司的 CEO 让 - 皮埃尔·加尼尔（un-pierre Garnier）在一个医疗卫生论坛上公开指责了西普拉等印度仿制药公司：「他们都是版权盗，这就是他们的真面目。他们这辈子从没有做过一天的研究。」大型药企里的一些人指控哈米耶德试图在非洲窃取市场份额，他的回应是：「他们说我别有用心。我当然别有用心啦：在死之前，我想做点好事。」

2001 年 3 月 5 日，当大型药企起诉南非政府一案在比陀利亚开庭时，全世界的人都聚集起来抗议制药公司。在南非，示威者在比利亚最高法院外面游行。在英国，他们在葛兰素史克的药厂外抗议。在美国，艾滋病活动家也在各大城市集会。

哈米耶德和活动家们胜利了。到了 4 月，跨国药企宣布他们将撤销诉讼，并放开专利，好让固定剂量的艾滋病鸡尾酒仿制药物在非洲廉价出售。8 月，西普拉宣布他们的科学家已成功研制出 Triomune，将不方便服用的鸡尾酒配方浓缩进了一片药里。在这个过程中，西普拉绕开了西方专利法，因为其中的三种药物由不同的生产商生产，属于不同的专利，按照法律几年内都不能复制。

就在这时，克林顿基金会介入并敲定了一份协议，印度制药商同意进一步将价格下调到每天 38 美分，以换取非洲政府大批量购买的承诺。克林顿基金会甚至带来了有机合成研究员，以帮助印度公司减少药物生产的步骤，这也是价格下降的一个原因。不过，改变西方人观念的还是那个每天一美元的定价，使他们从「我们帮不起这个忙」变成了「我们不能不帮这个忙」。那些艾滋病活动家本来没有把小布什总统看作盟友，但是 2003 年 1 月 28 日，小布什总统却在国情咨文中宣布了一个令他们震惊的计划：未来五年，美国政府将在抗艾滋病药物上支出 150 亿美元。他解释说，药物成本的大幅下跌「使我们拥有巨大的可能…… 历史很少给我们这么好的机会，能为这么多人做这么多事」。这个计划的名字叫「总统防治艾滋病紧急救援计划」（The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relie，缩写 PEPFAR，以下简称「总统防艾计划」）至今还在实施。终于，这个世界迈着犹豫的步伐，跟上了哈米耶德发起的这场革命。

对大型药企而言，总统防艾计划却如同一场噩梦：这项美国纳税人赞助的上百亿美元的计划，居然是为了给非洲生产仿制药！就在小布什公开计划几天之后，有几家跨国药企的 CEO 向白宫发起了请愿，要求它收回每天一美元成本的承诺。白官拒绝了。不过作为妥协，小布什还是允许由大型药企集团来挑选总统防艾计划的牵头人。结果令艾滋病活动家们沮丧：他们选出了兰尔·托比亚斯（Randall Tobia）—— 礼来公司的前任 CEO。

除了成本问题，还有另一个问题有待解决：品质。西方社会要如何确保它为非洲购买的抗艾滋病药物品质全部过关呢？仿药的拥护者们找到了世卫组织，世卫组织同意担任高品质仿制药的国际清算机构。它会负责视察那些有意愿在国际上出售抗艾滋病药物的公司，如果视察通过，就将这些公司的名称列入一张资格清单。但这个办法并没有让所有人都满意。在托比亚斯的领导下，总统防艾计划冷不丁地提出了一个新要求：任何用美国纳税人的钱购买并销往非洲的抗艾滋病药物，都必须得到美国药监局的批准。

这个要求引发了雪崩般的批评。在艾滋病活动家看来，这完全是在变着法子为自身牟利，因为大多数印度公司生产的所有药物都没有得到美国药监局的批准。活动家们怀疑，这种没有必要的防范措施的真正目的是将税金导向大型药企，并将仿制药生产商排除在外。他们获得了有力的支持。2004 年 3 月，包括约翰·麦凯恩（John Mccain，共和党，亚利桑那州）和泰德肯尼迪（Ted Kennedy，民主党，马萨诸塞州）在内的六位参议员给小布什总统写了一封语带挖苦的信，指出美国药监局的审批会延迟患者获得药物的时间，这毫无必要，而且世卫组织的标准已经「达到或超过了全世界受到尊敬的监管机构所采取的标准」。有几句显然是在讽刺那些大型药企，几位参议员写道：「为了审核仿制药的安全性和有效性，让美国药监局制定重复的程序，其真实目的着实令人怀疑。」一名白官前助理透露，就连前总统克林顿都给小布什总统打电话，表示世卫组织的审批已经能满足他的基金会的要求。

但话说回来，让仿制药接受美国药监局的审核，并不只是在冷血地维护大型药企的利益。在布什政府内部，也不是每个人都对印度仿制药的品质感到乐观。在白官和美国药监局举行的一系列紧张的会议上，官员们就如何检验将要采购的药物的品质展开了激烈辩论。他们的分岐很严重。

时任美国监局药物政策制定主管兼局长的司各特·戈特利布（Scott Gottlieb）博士回忆说：「我们当时认为，如果美国纳税人为非洲购买的是效力不足、受到污染的抗艾滋病药物，那将是一大丑闻。」在出任局长的几年前，他还向一位记者回忆：「当时外界压力很大，都要求我们购买印度的冒牌药。」他接着补充道，「我是叫它们冒牌药的，别人都叫它们仿制药。」

在两党的强大压力之下，各方最终妥协：美国药监局制定了一套针对总划药物的快速审核流程，这是公共卫生事业的一次显著胜利。这下卖到非洲的平价仿制药也有美国药监局的担保了。2005 年 5 月 27 日，兰伯西因其抗艾滋病药物而成为首个获得总统防艾计划审批的度仿制药公司。许多其他公司也跟了上来。

世界上部分最贫穷的人是因为哈米耶德博士才活下来的。然而他的革命也引出了个意想不到的结果。随着越来越多的印度公司获得美国药监局的批准，在非洲销售药物，人们开始形成一个很快将颠仿制药产业并且改变美国药物供应格局的认识：既然印度生产的平价药能获得美国监管者的批准，那美国人不是也可以服用它们吗？

## 0203. A Clever Way of Doing Things

DECEMBER 2005 | Canonsburg, Pennsylvania

A brand-name drug, no matter how complex or difficult to make, inevitably follows a recipe, such as: mix fifteen minutes, granulate, mist until ingredients reach 4 percent moisture content, mix again for thirty minutes. Making a generic version, however, requires figuring out a different recipe, ideally one that is faster to make but produces a similar result. That effort of reverse-engineering is undertaken by process chemists.

Among them, Rajiv Malik ranked as one of the best. Trained in the laboratories of Punjab, he held more than sixty process patents for reverse-engineering. Over seventeen years at Ranbaxy, he rose to the head of formulation development and regulatory affairs. He was also a veteran of laboratory disasters, such as when Ranbaxy’s anti-acne drug Sotret yielded failing results. His colleagues’「irrationality」in choosing to continue sales of the defective formulation contributed to his decision to leave, he would later say. He submitted his resignation in June 2003.

Taking an eight-step chemical synthesis, like A-B-C-D-E-F-G and altering it to G-C-B-F is no simple task. The formulation has to produce results that can withstand scrutiny from regulators and legal challenges from patent lawyers. Malik was in the business of finding solutions to problems that eluded others. Fast-talking, with a buoyant personality, he had a warm smile, graying salt-and-pepper hair, and a tendency to curse exuberantly.

Malik left Ranbaxy just as the U.S. government came to rely on Indian companies to make low-cost drugs for Africa. With that came a notable shift. Indian companies were also moving into the U.S. market, and U.S. companies were moving their operations to India, in a turbo-charged global marketplace that prized Malik’s particular skills.

Two and a half years after his departure from Ranbaxy, he became chief operating officer of Matrix Laboratories, a drug company in Hyderabad, founded by an Indian industrialist. Some of his Ranbaxy colleagues followed him. Together, they helped build Matrix into the world’s second-largest producer of active ingredients, with a particular focus on the AIDS drugs being purchased for the PEPFAR program. There, Malik was essentially perched on top of a new ecosystem, one created by the promise that Dr. Yusuf Hamied of Cipla had made to the world. Indian companies could make mass quantities of effective drugs at bargain-basement prices, while still following all the good manufacturing practices required by Western regulators.

As to how Indian companies could pull off such a feat, Dr. Raghunath Anant Mashelkar, a renowned evangelist for Indian science, advanced a theory: India’s scientists excelled at rethinking old processes and making them more efficient because of their engineering excellence and experience of destitution. The result, said Mashelkar, was「Gandhian innovation.」One of Mahatma Gandhi’s essential tenets held that the inventions of science should be for the public benefit. Because Indians had minimal resources, Mashelkar argued, they had developed a「clever way of doing things」that delivered more benefits to more people at a lower cost.

Some still viewed Indian drug companies as bottom-feeders, living off the remnants of painstaking research and innovation. But Mashelkar explained that「affordable」did not necessarily mean「worse.」It could often mean「better.」At Matrix, Malik’s exceptional results stood out. And it did not take long for the West to come calling.

The Appalachian generic drug company Mylan Laboratories was every inch American. In 1961, two army vets launched it in an abandoned ice skating rink in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The company became known for its ethos, as articulated by one of its founders, Mike Puskar:「Do it right, or don’t do it at all.」Its flagship plant, in Morgantown, West Virginia, which sits on twenty-two acres, became one of the world’s largest. Its size and importance led the FDA to establish an almost continuous presence there. As the company-sponsored book Mylan: 50 Years of Unconventional Success recounted, an FDA investigator would perch on a ladder and draw a white-gloved finger across the top of the manufacturing equipment. (Regulations required that all surfaces be dust-free.) Company executives let out a sigh of relief once the gloved finger came up「white as ever.」

The plant required its technicians to pay keen attention to detail. Prospective employees were shown a fifteen-minute video (unrelated to drug making) and then quizzed on what they’d seen: What came first? What came second?「In a GMP [good manufacturing practices] environment, you want them to do it the way they’re instructed to do it,」explained Kevin Kolar, Mylan’s former vice president of manufacturing technical support.「If someone makes a mistake, an investigation has to be launched.」

Any responsible drug maker had to try to minimize risk. But by late 2005, Mylan’s CEO, Robert Coury, was confronting the ultimate wild card: Mylan was losing market share to Indian drug companies that made their own active ingredients in-house and operated at rock-bottom costs. By contrast, Mylan was ordering ingredients from Chinese and Indian suppliers. Mylan couldn’t beat their price — unless it joined them and went global.

Coury turned to one of Mylan’s ingredient suppliers, Matrix Laboratories. In December 2005, he met Matrix’s chairman in a New Jersey airport lounge, and the two men hammered out a deal on a cocktail napkin. Mylan would become the first U.S. company to buy a publicly traded Indian company. The deal, which closed in January 2007, gave Mylan a global platform. But perhaps Mylan’s greatest asset from the acquisition was Rajiv Malik himself, who became Mylan’s executive vice president in charge of global technical operations. He brought a number of his tried-and-true team members who’d been with him at Ranbaxy.

At Mylan, he became part of an American executive team. Alongside Coury sat Chief Operating Officer Heather Bresch, the daughter of West Virginia Democratic governor Joe Manchin (now senior U.S. senator). The Indians and the Americans liked to describe the integration of Matrix and Mylan as seamless.「Bresch and Coury saw in the Matrix team a mirror image of Mylan’s: they were ambitious, hard-working, and committed to quality,」as Mylan’s company-sponsored book recounted. By the time the deal closed,「we started speaking the same language,」Malik said. At their first celebratory dinner, they all ate Indian food, which most of Mylan’s executives had never sampled, reared as they were on meat and potatoes.

Yet the differences between the two teams were as real as the different worlds from which they’d come. In India, generics companies were star performers whose every flicker of stock price got breathless coverage by the business press. In the United States, generic drug companies operated with relative anonymity. When Malik eventually settled in a Pittsburgh doctors’ community, he noted with surprise:「Nobody fucking knows Mylan.」

But a more consequential difference between Malik’s past employers and his new one was the companies’ orientation toward quality. In theory, all companies that made drugs for highly regulated markets operated inside a triangle of cost, speed, and quality. Of those, quality was supposedly a fixed point, its requirements set by regulation. Manufacturing processes had to be transparent, repeatable, and investigable, without exception or deviation. But generic drug makers, under enormous pressure to reduce costs and speed up development so that their applications were first, faced a central tension: How low could they slash their costs? And how quickly could they move before quality began to suffer?

Some in the industry claim that it costs about 25 percent more to follow the good manufacturing practices required for regulated markets like the United States. That leaves companies with difficult choices. What if a sterile mop costs `$4` (far more than a regular one), and in a typical day you are supposed to use nine mops? What if your customers want a vaccine for 4 cents a dose but it costs 40 cents to make? But the central problem is the generic drug business model itself. How can you maintain quality when a brand-name pill that costs `$14` one day is going to cost 4 cents as a generic the next day? This dynamic「doesn’t motivate you to invest」in maintaining high manufacturing quality, as Malik himself acknowledged.

In the face of this conflict, company culture mattered. Malik and his team had gotten their training at Ranbaxy, where the posters on the office walls exhorted employees to push toward the company’s goal of reaching $1 billion in U.S. sales by 2015. But Malik had landed in a different culture. The posters in Mylan’s conference room emphasized:「Discover why at Mylan quality isn’t just a claim, it’s a cause we’ve made personal.」Mylan was so committed to its image of quality and transparency that it eventually built a glass-walled headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, and gave its executives partly transparent business cards.

At Mylan, Malik was tasked with doing what he had always done: navigating an array of obstacles in the laboratory; filing applications swiftly enough to keep the pipeline full; and ensuring that these efforts passed muster with the world’s toughest regulators. But he was doing it all from the glass-walled headquarters of an American company that anticipated, and was accustomed to, continuous oversight.

Patients tend to assume that their generic drugs are identical to brand-name drugs, in part because they imagine a simple and amicable process: as a patent expires, the brand-name company turns over its recipe, and a generic company makes the same drug, but at a fraction of the cost, since it no longer has to invest in research or marketing. But in fact, generic drug companies fight a legal, scientific, and regulatory battle, often in the dark, from the moment they set out to develop a generic. Mostly, their drugs come to market not with help from brand-name drug companies, but in spite of their efforts to stop them.

Brand companies often resort to「shenanigans」and「gaming tactics」to delay generic competition, as the exasperated FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb put it. They will erect a fortress of patents around their drugs, sometimes patenting each manufacturing step — even the time-release mechanism, if there is one. They may make small alterations to their drugs and declare them new, to add years to their patents, a move known as「evergreening.」Rather than sell samples of their drugs, which generic makers need in order to study and reverse-engineer them, brand-name companies will withhold samples, which in 2018 led the FDA to begin publicly shaming the companies accused of such practices by posting their names on its website.

To successfully launch a product, generic drug companies must tread in reverse through this obstacle course. Once a generic company zeroes in on a molecule, and its scientists figure out how it operates in the body, its lawyers get to work to establish how well protected it is legally. The next step takes place in the laboratory: developing the active pharmaceutical ingredient by synthesizing it into ingredient form. That alone can take several years of trial and error. Once successful, the finished generic has to take the same form as the brand, whether that be pill, capsule, tablet, or injection. Formulating it requires additional ingredients known as excipients, which can be different, but might also be litigated.

Then comes testing. In the lab, the in-vitro tests replicate conditions in the body. During dissolution tests, for example, the drug will be put in beakers whose contents mimic stomach conditions, to see how the drugs break down. But some of the most important tests are in-vivo — when the drug is tested on people.

Brand-name companies must test new drugs on thousands of patients to prove that they are safe and effective. Generic companies have to prove only that their drug performs similarly in the body to the brand-name drug. To do this, they must test it on a few dozen healthy volunteers and map the concentration of the drug in their blood. The results yield a graph that contains the all-important bioequivalence curve. The horizontal line reflects the time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of drug in the blood. The vertical line reflects the peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in the blood. Between these two axes lies the area under the curve (AUC). The test results must fall in that area to be deemed bioequivalent.

Every batch of drugs has variation. Even brand-name drugs made in the same laboratory under the exact same conditions will have some batch-to-batch differences. So, in 1992, the FDA created a complex statistical formula that defined bioequivalence as a range — a generic drug’s concentration in the blood could not fall below 80 percent or rise above 125 percent of the brand name’s concentration. But the formula also required companies to impose a 90 percent confidence interval on their testing, to ensure that less than 20 percent of samples would fall outside the designated range and far more would land within a closer range to the innovator product.

After the active ingredients are manufactured, the additional ingredients chosen, and the principal laboratory and clinical tests conducted, the formula then moves to the manufacturing floor to see if it can be made on a commercial scale.

As the manufacturing runs become larger, the processes become harder to control. If something can go wrong, it will. You can build a fortress of current good manufacturing practices around the drug-making process and still「shit happens,」as Malik liked to say. Conscientious manufacturers try to protect against past disasters and prevent new ones. But because manufacturing plants are operated by humans, the systems will break down, no matter how perfectly designed they are. For example, Johnson & Johnson’s epilepsy drug was fine until the company stacked it on wooden pallets that likely leached solvents into the medicine. At Mylan’s Morgantown plant, one lab technician left a note for another stating that he had to「rig」a hose on the equipment to get it to work properly — a word choice that easily could have shut down the plant had an FDA investigator stumbled across it and suspected fraud instead of primitive problem-solving.

The only remedy for this variability is for plants to adhere scrupulously to good manufacturing practices and create real-time records of each drug-making step. The resulting data serve as a blueprint for finding and fixing the inevitable errors, a process that FDA investigators scrutinize. How well and how closely did the company investigate itself? The goal is to address a problem「in a way that it never happens again,」as Malik explained.

As Malik confronted these challenges, he proved that he was more than a formulation wizard. He was adept at remaking himself. He rose swiftly at Mylan to chief operating officer. Bresch, in turn, became CEO, and Coury was elevated to executive chairman. Malik oversaw a swelling operation in India, where the company would soon grow to have twenty-five of its forty global facilities and over half of its 30,000 employees.

In many ways, Malik took Mylan by storm. He reoriented the company toward India and helped create competition between the research and development teams in Morgantown and Hyderabad. Within three years, the number of drug applications Mylan submitted to the FDA tripled and approvals doubled. But Malik was also careful to emphasize the importance of quality and summed up this priority for employees in typical fashion:「If you miss something in the quality space, we don’t live with that shit.」

His rapid ascent seemed proof that he’d mastered the tensions between cost, quality, and speed, using cleverness, as the innovation expert Mashelkar had put it. But Mashelkar made one important distinction. India’s「clever way」of doing things was not to be confused with an approach that Indians referred to as Jugaad — taking ethically dubious shortcuts to get as quickly as possible to the desired goal. The word connoted a compromise on quality and an approach that should be「banished」entirely, Mashelkar explained to a visitor in his office at the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune.

But at Mylan, as Malik and his team seemed to hit every formulation deadline, some employees began to wonder whether Gandhian innovation was the only explanation for their success.

用聪明的方法做事 | 宾夕法尼亚州卡农斯堡

一种品牌药无论生产过程多么复杂、多么难，都一定有配方可循，比如，混合 15 分钟，造粒，喷雾，直至原料含水量达到 4%，然后再混合 30 分钟。而生产仿制药却要求想出另外一套配方，速度最好更快，但要产生同样的结果。这种逆向工程就是由有机合成研究员完成的。

其中拉吉夫·马立克就是一位佼佼者。他早年在旁遮普的几家实验室学习，拥有 60 多项逆向工程的专利。在兰伯西工作的 17 年间，他一路升到了配方开发和法规事务主任的职位。他还是一个熟悉实验室灾难的老手，比如兰伯西的抗疮药物 Sotret 失去功效时就找了他来。他后来说，同事们继续销售无效配方的「非理性」选择使他决定离职。2003 年 6 月，他提出了辞呈。

比如，一个有着八个步骤的化学合成过程，用 A-B-C-D-E-F-G 代表，但要将其改造成 G-C-B-F，绝不是简单的任务。新配方产生的结果必须能经受监管者的检验和专利律师的非难。马立克的工作是解决令其他人无计可施的难题。他语速很快，神采飞扬，笑容温暖，有一头灰白的头发，常常「出口成脏」。

马立克离开兰伯西时，正逢美国政府依靠印度公司为非洲生产低价药物。这带来了一个显著的变化：印度公司开始进入美国市场，美国公司也开始将业务扩展到印度，在这个充满活力的全球市场，马立克的特殊技能得到了重用。离开兰伯西两年半之后，马立克成为矩阵实验室的首席运营官，这是一家位于海得拉巴的药企，由一位印度实业家创立。几个兰伯西的同事跟他起去了。他们一起将矩阵实验室建设成了世界第二大药物有效成分生产商，公司特别专注于生产总统防艾计划支持购买的抗艾滋病药物。在矩阵实验室，马立克在一套新的生态系统中登上了顶端，而创造这套系统的，正是西普拉的优素福·哈米耶德博士对世界许下的承诺：印度公司能以低廉的价格大量生产有效药物，同时又循西方监管机构要求的所有良好生产规范。

至于印度公司如何才能实现这样的壮举，印度科学界的著名推广者拉古纳特·阿南特·马舍尔卡（Raghunath Anant Mashelkar）博士提出一个理论 [3]：因为高超的工程技艺和贫困的生活经验，印度的科学家们很擅长反思老旧的程序，并将之改造得更为高效。马舍尔卡博说，这样的结果就是「甘地式的革新」：圣雄甘地的一条重要教就是，科学创造必须为公共利益服务。由于印度人资源极少，马舍尔卡认为，他们学会了「用聪明的方法做事」，以更低的成本为更多人创造更大的利益。

一些人仍把印度制药公司看作底动物，靠别人辛勤研究和创造中剩下的东西生存。但是马舍尔卡表示，「廉价」未必代表「低劣」，它往往意味着「更好」[4]。在矩阵实验室里，马立克的优异成果脱颖而出。没过多久，就有西方人来拜访了。

阿巴拉契亚山下的仿制药公司迈兰实验室是家彻头彻尾的美国企业。1961 年，两个陆军老兵在西弗吉尼亚州白硫磺泉镇的一座废弃冰场里建立了它。公司以其独特气质闻名，它的创立者之一迈克·普斯卡尔（Mike Puskar）说得很明白：「要么别做，要做就做对。」公司的总厂位于西弗吉亚州的摩根敦，占地 22 英亩，是世界上最大的药厂之一。由于其规模和重要性，美国药监局几乎随时有人到访。正如公司赞助的《迈兰：50 年非常规的成功》（Mylan: 50 Years of Unconventional Success）书所写的那样，美国药监局的调査员会攀在梯子上，戴着白手套，用手指摸生产设备的顶部按规定工厂内的所有表面均不得沾灰尘。）如果那只戴着手套的手指「依然是白色」，公司的高管们就会松一口气。

工厂对技术员的要求是密切关注细节。员工在入职前要观看一段 15 分钟的录像（内容与制药无关），然后回答他们看见了什么：最先出现了什么？接着又出现了什么？在迈兰负责生产技术支持的前副总裁凯文·科拉尔表示：「在一个奉行良好生产规范的环境里，员工都必须按指示做事。只要有人犯错，就必须开展调查。」

任何一个负责任的制药商都要尽量降低风险。但是在 2005 年年底，迈兰的 CEO 罗伯特·考里（Robert Coury）却面临着一个超乎常规的局面：迈兰的市场份额正在被印度制药公司夺走，那些公司自己能生产有效成分，运营成本也极低。与他们相比，迈兰还要从中国和印度的供应商那里进口成分。迈兰在价格上不是他们的对手 —— 除非和他们联手走向全球。

考里去找了迈兰的一家成分供应商 —— 矩阵实验室。2005 年 12 月，他在新泽西的一个机场休息室里见到了矩阵实验室的董事长。两个男人在一张酒巾上定了一份协议。迈兰将成为第一家收购印度上市公司的美国企业。交易在 2007 年 1 月完成时，迈兰拥有了全球平台。不过迈兰在这次收购中的最大收获也许还是拉吉夫·马立克本人，他开始出任迈兰的执行副总裁负责全球技术运营。他从兰伯西带来了几个经验丰富的团队成员。在迈兰，马立克成为美国高管团队中的一员。在团队中，和考里平起平坐的是首席运营官希瑟·布雷施（Heather Bresch），她是西弗吉尼亚州民主党籍的州长乔曼（Joe Manchin，现为资深美国参议员）的女儿。

公司里的印度人和美国人都喜欢说，矩阵和迈兰融合得天衣无缝。正像迈兰公司赞助的那本书中所写的那样：「布雷施和考里在矩阵的团队里看到了迈兰的镜像：两者同样雄心勃勃，勤奋工作，并且重视品质。」当交易完成时，马立克说：「我们已经说起了同样的语言。」在第一场庆功宴上家都吃了印度菜，迈兰的大多数高管都吃肉类和土豆长大，从来没有尝过印度菜。

然而，两支团队毕竟还是有差别的，就像孕育他们的两个世界一样。在印度，仿制药公司是明星企业，股价每有波动，商业报刊就会连篇累牍地报道。而在美国，仿制药公司就少有人知了。当马立克终于在匹兹堡的一个医生社区里住下时，他惊讶地发现：「谁也没听说过迈兰。」

不过，马立克的旧底雇主和新东家之间还有一个重要差异，那就是对于品质的态度。从理论上说，所有为监管严格的市场生产药物的公司都要在一个成本、速度和品质构成的三角框架内运作。在这三者中，品质应该是一个固定点，对它的要求由法规设定。生产过程必须透明、可以重复、可以追查，不能有例外或者偏差。而仿制药的生产商承担着巨大压力，他们要降低成本、加快开发过程，以便第一个申请到许可证，因而面临着几个核心问题生产成本可以到多低？在品质不受影响的前提下，生产过程又可以提高到多快？

些业内人士说，要在美国这样监管严格的市场上遵循良好生产规范成本会增加 25% 左右。这就会使公司面临艰难的择。如果一把无菌拖把价格为 4 美元（比普通拖把贵得多），而你平均每天都要使用 9 把无菌拖把那你该怎么办？如果你的客户想买 4 美分一支的疫苗，但你生产一支疫苗就要 40 美分呢？但最核心的题还是仿制药的商业模式本身。如果今天还是 14 美元一片的品牌药到明天就变成了 4 美分，你还怎么保持品质？马立克自也承认，这种格局「不会鼓励你在保持生产品质上投资」。

在这样的冲突面前，公司文化就变得很重要了。马立克和他的团队是在兰伯西接受训练的。在那里，办公室墙上的海报鼓励员工在 2015 年实现在美国的销量达到 10 亿美元的目标。而现在他来到一个不同的文化面前。迈兰会议室里的海报强调的是：「你会发现品质在迈兰不仅是一句口号，更是人人关心的事业。」迈兰花了很大的力气维护其重品质、重透明的形象，以至于后来它在宾州的卡农斯堡建造了一座装着玻璃外墙的总部大楼，公司高管的名片也做成了半透明的。

在迈兰，马立克的工作一如既往：绕过实验室的重重障碍；迅速提交申请，保持申请不断；确保获得全世界最严格的监管机构的认可。只不过这些工作全是在一家美国公司装着玻璃外墙的总部中进行的，这家公司对于持续的监管早有准备，也早已习惯了。

患者往往认为，他们服用的仿药和品牌药完全相同，部分原因是他们想象的是一个简单而友善的过程：在一种药物专利过期之后，品牌药公司就交出配方，接着仿制药公司就会生产出同样的药物，但成本只有一个零头，因为它不必再在研究或营销上花线了。但实际上，从着手开发仿制药的那一刻起，仿制药公司就开始了一场事关法律、科学和监管的战役，而且他们往往要在黑暗中作战。大多数时候，他们的产品进入市场时，得到的不是品牌药公司的帮助，而是阻挠。

美国药监局局长司各特·戈特利布曾恼怒地指出，品牌药公司常常诉诸「鬼把戏」和「欺策略」来拖住仿制药的竞争。他们会为自家的药物竖起一圈专利堡全，有时还会为每一个生产步骤申请专利 一一 就连缓释技术也不放过，如果有的话。他们可能对药物稍做修改，然后宣称那是一种新药，并在专利上增加几年，这种做法被称为「常青策略」。仿制药生产商需要品牌药的样品才能对它们做研究和分解，但是品牌药公司经常扣住样品不卖。2018 年，美国药监局开始对被指控有过此类行为的公司下手，把它们的名字挂在网站上示众。

要想成功推出产品，仿制药公司就必须沿着这条障碍赛道反向行进。仿制药公司一旦锁定一种分子，公司的科学家也弄清了它在人体内发挥功效的原理，公司的律师便会开始调查它在法律上受到多大程度的保护。接下来的事就在实验室中进行：合成、开发药物的有效成分。单是这个过程就可能要经过几年的反复尝试。如果成功，成品仿制药还要采用和品牌药相同的剂型，如药丸、胶囊、药片或注射剂。制作剂型需要被称为「辅料」的额外原料，辅料可以和品牌药不同，但这同样可能惹上官司。

接着就是检测了。在实验室中，研究者通过体外检测复制体内的环境。比如在溶解检测中，药物被放进烧杯 一一 杯中的东西模拟的就是胃部的环境，以观察药物如何在胃中分解。但一些最重要的检测都是在体内进行的也就是在人身上检测药物。

品牌药公司必须在数以千计的患者身上检测新药，才能证明它们的安全性和功效。而仿制药公司只要证明他们的药物能在人体内起到和品牌药类似的效果就行。为此，他们也必须在几十名健康的志愿者身上试验，并绘出药物在他们体内的浓度分布图。试验结果会生成一张坐标图，其中包含那条最重要的生物等效性曲线。坐标的横轴反映的是药物在血液中的达峰时间（Tmax），纵轴反映药物在血液中的峰值浓度（Cmax）。这两根轴线之间是曲线下面积（AUC）。检测结果只有落在那块面积之内，才可以算是生物等效的。

2『生物等效性曲线。做一张术语卡片。』——已完成

每个批次的药物都有差异。即使是在同一间实验室的相同条件下生产的品牌药，不同的批次生产出来的也有所不同。因此在 1992 年，美国药监局提出了一个复杂的统计学公式 [10]，将「生物等效性」定义为一个范围：仿制药在血液中的浓度不能低于品牌药浓度的 80%，也不能高于它的 125%。但这个式还要求各公司对自家的检测设置 90% 置信区间，确保落在指定范围之外的样本不到 20%，同时绝大多数样本都落在离创新产品更近的范国之内。

在做出有效成分、选定额外成分并开展主要的实验室以及临床试验之后，还要将配方转移到生产车间，看它能否以商业规模生产。

随着生产规模的扩大，生产过程也变得更难控制。只要有什么步骤可能错，它就一定会出错。就算你在制药过程周围用现行良好生产规范筑起一座堡垒，仍会出现马立克喜欢说的「破烂事」。尽责的生产商会尽量杜绝旧的灾难，预防新的。但因为生产车间是由人操作的，系统总会发生故障，无论它们设计得多么完善。比如美国强生的一种抗癫痫药物 [11]，原本好好的，被公司放到木头托盘上后就出了问题，可能是托盘中的溶液渗进了药里。在迈兰位于摩根敦的工厂，一个实验室技术员给另一名技术员留了张便条，说他得去「搞一搞」设备上的软管，让它正常工作。如果当时有美国药监局的调查员看到这张便条，他会怀疑「搞一搞」指的不是一种原始的解决问题的方法，而是作假的手段，很可能就此让工厂关闭。

要消除这样的变数，唯一的办法就是让工厂严格遵守良好生产规范，并对每一个制药步骤进行实时记录。由此生成的数据可以作为蓝图，用来发现并修正不可避免的错误，这也是美国药监局的调查员会仔细检查的过程。公司在自我检查的时候有多彻底，多仔细？正如马立克所说，公司的目标是在解决问题的同时「杜绝它再次发生」。

面对这些难题时，马立克证明了自己不仅是一位配方奇才，还很擅长重塑自身。在迈兰，他很快升到了首席运营官的位子。布雷施则顺势成为 CEO，考里也升上了执行董事长的位子。马立克负责的印度业务不断扩张，印度很快会拥有公司 40 家全球工厂中的 25 家以及 3 万名员工中超过半数的人。

从许多方面看，马立克都在迈兰掀起了一阵旋风。他将公司的发展方向转向印度，并在摩根与海得拉巴的研发团队之间创造了竞争关系。在不到三年的时间里，迈兰向美国药监局提交的新药申请就增长了两倍，获批的申请也翻了一番。但马立克也特意强调了品质的重要性，并以典型的方式为员工做了总结：「如果你们在品质上开了小差，我们是不会容忍这种破事发生的。」

他的快速升迁似乎证明，他已经用聪明才智熟练地平衡了成本、品质和速度之间的张力，就像创新专家马舍尔卡所说的那样。不过马尔卡也点出了一个重要的区别：在印度，不能把「聪明」的做事方法和印度人所谓的「Jugaad」（随机应变）相混滑，后者指的是通过伦理上可疑的捷径，以最快的速度达成向往的目标。马尔卡在他位于浦那市国家化学实验室的办公室里对一名来访者表示，这个词的言下之意是牺牲品质，这是应该完全「摒弃」的做法。

但是在迈兰，马立克及其团队每一次提交配方都能赶上最后期限，有些员工就开始怀疑甘地式的创新是不是公司成功的唯一原因了。

## 0204. The Assignment

AUGUST 18, 2004 | Gurgaon, India

At 8:30 a.m., the heat already stifling outside, Dinesh Thakur looked around the conference table at his six project managers and saw tired faces. Some had left their homes hours earlier to beat rush-hour traffic and arrive on time. They knew the meeting was important, but didn’t know its agenda. Thakur was about to give his team one of the stranger tasks in the annals of corporate due diligence, but had decided in advance to keep the true reasons for it to himself.

「We have a new assignment from Dr. Kumar,」he began.「He wants to know if we can substantiate all of the data that we have provided to various countries. This is a retrospective review of our portfolio, and he wants to know how confident we are about the information we have provided to various regulatory agencies in the last twenty years.」

The members of his team looked surprised, yet the assignment fell within their wheelhouse. Their job was to map all of Ranbaxy’s data, so it was only logical to find out if it was accurate first.

Thakur directed their attention to a large whiteboard where he’d drawn a graph. On the vertical axis were all the regions of the world where the company sold its drugs. On the horizontal axis were myriad questions. What products were on the market? When were they registered? Where were the actual dossiers used to register the products? Where was the supporting data? How many batches were sold in that market? What facility manufactured them?

Thakur assigned each of his staffers a region of the world. He directed them to compare the company’s raw manufacturing data for the drugs in those markets against the claims made in submissions to regulators. Did the data match up, or were there any discrepancies? Did the submissions comply with local regulations?

A picture of the company’s entire operations had never been pieced together before. Until then, Ranbaxy had been partitioned. Specific groups worked on product development for different regions, but almost never met to compare notes. No one had a complete picture of how — or even where — the company’s drugs were approved. But Thakur had directed his team to make a multidimensional assessment that spread across the entire globe and stretched back years.

His own efforts began with a visit to the associate director of regulatory affairs, Arun Kumar, who had been directed by Raj Kumar (no relation) to cooperate.

Arun, who worked in the office right above Thakur’s, was waiting with a bemused air.「Everyone knows,」he said, by way of greeting.

「Knows what?」Thakur asked.

「What the reality is,」he said. Arun went on to describe how Ranbaxy took its greatest liberties in markets where regulation was weakest and the risk of discovery was lowest.

「Are you saying that the products on the market in those regions are not all supported by data?」

「Well, not all of them,」said Kumar in a casual tone, flipping through a report on his desk.「We know where the gaps are.」

Thakur was stunned by his nonchalance.「Did you bring it up to management?」

「What for?」Kumar replied.「They already know. In fact, they probably know it better than I do.」

Thakur thought he must have misunderstood. If the applications included known gaps, he asked, how could Arun sign off on them when he was the one certifying their accuracy?

That was part of the problem, Arun explained. Even though he had prepared the dossiers, the regional regulatory heads, like Abha Pant in the United States, could make any changes they liked to any of the applications. They took their orders directly from the top management and signed off on dossiers without Arun’s knowledge or consent.

This was incredible to Thakur. At a company like Bristol-Myers Squibb, the regulatory affairs directors had absolute control over what was submitted to the FDA, and for good reason. When regulatory executives signed submissions, they were asserting the data was accurate. It was a criminal offense to make a false statement on a government record.

「Surely you are not saying what I think you’re saying, right?」Thakur asked.

「There is too much to lose in advanced markets like the U.S. and Europe if you get caught, so it doesn’t make sense to take blatant risks for those portfolios,」Arun explained.「However, [Africa], Latin America, India, that is a whole different story.」

Thakur was dumbfounded.「Who all knows?」

「Everyone does,」Arun said, adding,「Everyone knows where the directives come from.」

「Is there no fear of the repercussions?」

「They are managed,」said Arun.「Everything is managed.」

Thakur was so stunned that he had to end the meeting and leave, just to compose himself.

As he walked through the door of his office, his executive assistant asked,「What is wrong with you? You look like you have seen a ghost.」Thakur collapsed in his chair.

He knew that compliance failures and ethical lapses existed within the brand-name drug industry. After he left Bristol-Myers Squibb, the company’s finance chief and the head of its worldwide medicines group would both be charged with criminal conspiracy and securities fraud for allegedly inflating sales and profits by concealing unsold inventory, charges that were later dropped.

It was one thing to game the stock market or harm shareholders, allegations that would lead the men to reach a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, without admitting guilt. But what Arun had just described was another matter altogether. You had to test the drugs to see if they were properly formulated, stable, and effective. The resulting data was the only thing that proved the medicine would cure instead of kill. Yet Ranbaxy was treating data as an entirely fungible marketing tool, apparently without consideration for the impact on patients. It was an outright fraud that could mean the difference between life and death.

Thakur could barely wrap his mind around it. But the assignment he’d been given drove him to return to Arun Kumar’s office later that day.

「There is no point digging up these things,」Arun told him.「You will find yourself out of the company if you go down that path. Tell Raj you have looked into it, and there is nothing more to see.」

「I can’t lie to my boss,」said Thakur.

「What is wrong with you guys who go to the U.S. for a few years and think you have become the moral police of the world?」asked Arun.「Do you think U.S. pharma companies never do such things?」

In his ten years with Big Pharma, Thakur had never seen or imagined such conduct. He was young and somewhat naive, but also stubborn and not inclined to back down.「Let’s get on with it. Where do we start?」he asked impatiently.

Grudgingly, Arun went to a whiteboard and drew a diagram, by region, of the liability that Ranbaxy faced: the United States and Canada on the bottom; Europe next; Latin America above that; India next; and ROW (rest of the world), comprising the poorest African nations, on top.「I’d start there,」Arun said, pointing to the top.

Thakur still felt that he was groping in the dark. He needed numbers. Arun called in his executive assistant to help. Thakur asked the young man what percentage of the dossiers submitted to regulators contained data that did not match what the company had on file. The assistant was evasive:「It . . . varies from region to region.」

「Give me an estimate in each region,」said Thakur.「How about in the U.S.?」

The assistant thought for a moment, then estimated,「Perhaps between 50 and 60 percent?」Thakur could barely breathe. Ranbaxy had faked over half its dossiers to the FDA? And that was one of the better regions?

「How about Europe?」

「About the same,」came the assistant’s reply.

「And India?」

After some hemming and hawing, the assistant answered,「100 percent.」Testing the drugs for India was just a waste of time, he explained, because no regulators ever looked at the data. So the regional representatives just invented the dossiers on their own and sent them to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). What was needed for the DCGI was not real data but good connections, which they had, the assistant explained.

The scale of the deception stunned Thakur. He felt physically sick thinking about the patients. Thakur told the men he wanted a breakdown: each product by year, and the problem with each dossier.

As Thakur’s project managers began their analysis — obtaining data, conducting interviews, visiting laboratories and manufacturing plants — the rigid hierarchy within the company proved to be a major obstacle. Not only was Thakur’s team new, but by the unwritten rules of Indian corporate culture, its members were also too junior to question department heads.「We were unwelcome people,」recalled one of the team members, who had been tasked with tracking down data from Asian and Brazilian markets. As a result, they had to operate by stealth and stubbornness. They showed up at the factories unannounced. They waited hours to speak with department heads. They drove hours to distant manufacturing plants. Little by little, as the team members stitched together small pieces of information, they stumbled into Ranbaxy’s secret: the company manipulated almost every aspect of its manufacturing process to quickly produce impressive-looking data that would bolster its bottom line.

Each member of Thakur’s team came back with similar examples. At the behest of managers, the company’s scientists substituted lower-purity ingredients for higher ones to reduce costs. They altered test parameters so that formulations with higher impurities could be approved. They faked dissolution studies. To generate optimal results, they crushed up brand-name drugs into capsules so that they could be tested in lieu of the company’s own drugs. They superimposed brand-name test results onto their own in applications. For some markets, the company fraudulently mixed and matched data streams, taking its best data from manufacturing in one market and presenting it to regulators elsewhere as data unique to the drugs in their markets. For other markets, the company simply invented data. Document forgery was pervasive. The company even forged its own standard operating procedures, which FDA investigators rely on to assess whether a company is following its own policies. In one instance, employees backdated documents and then artificially aged them in a steamy room overnight in an attempt to fool regulators during inspections.

There was little effort to conceal this method of doing business. It was common knowledge, from senior managers and heads of research and development to the people responsible for formulation and the clinical people. Essentially, Ranbaxy’s manufacturing standards boiled down to whatever the company could get away with.

As Thakur knew from his years of training, a well-made drug is not one that passes its final test. Its quality must be assessed at each step of production and lies in all the data that accompanies it. Each of those test results, recorded along the way, helps to create an essential roadmap of quality. But because Ranbaxy was fixated on results, regulations and requirements were viewed with indifference. Good manufacturing practices were stop signs and inconvenient detours. So Ranbaxy was driving any way it chose to arrive at favorable results, then moving around road signs, rearranging traffic lights, and adjusting mileage after the fact. As the company’s head of analytical research would later tell an auditor:「It is not in Indian culture to record the data while we conduct our experiments.」

One of Thakur’s team members, who’d been thrilled to join Ranbaxy months earlier, found himself in a paradoxical situation. He had no data indicating the drugs weren’t safe, but he had no reliable data proving that they were. He’d go home after work and urge his relatives and loved ones not to buy any Ranbaxy products.

Thakur worked fourteen-hour days. He tried to build spreadsheets for each market: data the drugs had been filed with, data the company had sent to regulators for every approved product, existing data to support those claims. He would stay in the office till 9:00 p.m., preparing a work plan for the next day. At home, despite Sonal’s objections, Thakur would descend to his basement office and work until midnight, trying to synthesize the data flowing in from his team. As was typical, he was vague about the project, and Sonal didn’t ask. Nor did he ask himself the larger question about the professional ramifications of investigating his own company. Had he taken that single step back, he might have seen how perilous the project actually was.

Instead, he kept trying to wrap his mind around the scale of the emerging crisis. How could there be so much deception? Was there even a name for this behavior, which extended so far beyond what he’d ever imagined? Finally, after days of work, a word came into his mind, one that seemed to clarify what he was learning. Criminal. Yes, that was it. He was uncovering nothing short of a global crime.

After weeks of exhaustive research, Thakur brought his team’s preliminary findings on the Latin American, Indian, and ROW markets to his boss, Raj Kumar.

It was 7:30 a.m., the time Kumar usually got to work, and they met in his office. The hallways were still quiet. Thakur placed some preliminary spreadsheets in front of Kumar. They showed that numerous drugs had never been tested properly, if at all, and had no underlying data to support the company’s claims. Kumar perused them in silence.「This can’t be right,」he finally said. It seemed impossible that Ranbaxy had filed dossiers on drugs the company hadn’t actually tested. Kumar had never heard of anything like it.「You must have missed data.」

「We’ve looked, and it doesn’t exist,」Thakur insisted.

「You have to go back and check again,」Kumar asserted.「This has got to be wrong.」

To Kumar, the only plausible explanation was that Thakur had either overlooked existing test results or misinterpreted the results he’d found. Otherwise, there was no precedent for what Thakur had uncovered. In the coming weeks, Kumar sent him back to check and recheck so many times that finally Thakur organized a meeting with the team so that Kumar could hear from them directly.

They, too, had been stunned by their own findings and remained at a loss for how to think about what they’d found.「Corruption to me was more Enron, more how you fudge earnings,」Dinesh Kasthuril recalled. Venkat Swawinathan had expected「nepotism and inefficiency.」But doing things that jeopardized people’s lives was another thing altogether.

Once Kumar heard from each member of Thakur’s team, it finally sank in. The company was committing fraud and potentially harming patients on a global scale. He distilled the information into a four-page report for the CEO, Brian Tempest. Though blandly titled「Inadequate Dossiers filed in various countries for various products」and written in the gray lingo of corporate quality assurance, the report was explosive. It laid bare systemic fraud in Ranbaxy’s worldwide regulatory filings.「The majority of products filed in Brazil, Mexico, Middle East, Russia, Romania, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, African Nations, have data submitted which did not exist or data from different products and from different countries.」

Kumar’s document explained that while the company had slashed production costs and used the cheapest ingredients in those markets, it submitted data from the drugs that had been made for more regulated markets, a dangerous bait-and-switch that concealed the low quality. The report also noted that active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that failed purity tests had been reblended with good API until it met requirements.

The report noted the「non-availability」in India and Latin America of validation methods, stability data, and bioequivalence reports. In short, Ranbaxy had almost no method for confirming the content of drugs in those markets. For example, the data collected by Thakur’s team showed that of the 163 drug products approved in Brazil since 2000, almost all had been filed with phony batch records and stability data that did not exist.

The report noted that in a majority of regulatory filings, Ranbaxy had「intentionally misrepresented」small research and development batches (some two thousand doses) as exhibit batches one hundred times the size, and then deceptively performed crucial tests for bioequivalence and stability on the smaller, easier-to-control batches. The result was that its commercial-sized batches had not actually been tested before being sold, putting millions of patients at risk.

In an email to Tempest marked「confidential」accompanying the report, Kumar noted that lack of adherence to regulation was only part of the problem.「It appears that some of these issues were apparent over a year ago and I cannot find any documents which sought to address these concerns or resolve the issues.」In closing, he made clear that his ultimate loyalties lay not with the company but with the truth.「I can not allow any information to be used for any dossier unless fully supported by data,」he wrote, adding:「With your permission, I would like to take advice from legal counsel in London as to my current responsibility and indemnity with respect to the above issues.」

In response, Tempest assured Kumar that the company would do the right thing.

Though the picture was grim, Kumar confided to Thakur that he believed he could fix the problems, if given the authority.

Thakur’s findings were not news to Ranbaxy’s top executives. Just ten months earlier, in October 2003, outside auditors started investigating Ranbaxy facilities worldwide. In this case, the audits had been ordered up by Ranbaxy itself. This was a common industry practice: drug companies often hired consultants to audit their facilities as a dry run to see how visible their problems were. If the consultants could find it, they reasoned, then most likely regulators could too.

The fact-finding mission by Lachman Consultant Services left Ranbaxy officials under no illusion as to the extent of the company’s failings. At Ranbaxy’s Princeton, New Jersey, facility, auditors found that the company’s Patient Safety Department barely functioned and training was essentially「non-existent.」The staff had no written protocols for investigating patient complaints, which piled up in boxes, uncategorized and unreported. They had no clerical help for basic tasks like mailing out the patients’ samples for testing.「I don’t think there’s the same medicine in this medicine,」was a common refrain from patients. Even when there were investigations, they were so perfunctory and half-hearted that expiration dates were listed as「unknown,」even when they could easily have been found from a product’s lot number.

An audit of Ranbaxy’s main U.S. manufacturing plant, Ohm Laboratories in New Jersey, found that the company, though required to report adverse events to the FDA, rarely did so. There was no system to capture patient complaints after hours, and no global medical officer to ensure that any potential negative consequences for patients were being monitored. The consultants from Lachman urged Ranbaxy to address these problems globally. Ranbaxy’s initial reaction to the findings was to question the number of hours, and the resulting invoice, that Lachman had sent for its work.

The picture was not a lot rosier overseas. At a plant called Mohali, in India’s northern state of Punjab, auditors found so little control of records that twenty people were authorized to change test results. Over 120 different batch records had been reprinted, which Ranbaxy claimed was due to faulty dot matrix printers that had not been replaced. If the goal of good manufacturing was total control, this was about as wild and careening a picture as one could get.

The head of Lachman later sent a top company official a wide-ranging plan for corrective action. Among the suggestions was to establish a training program for workers, including a module entitled「Creating a Culture of Trust, Ethical Behavior, and a ‘Quality First’ Mindset.」But Ranbaxy refused to implement the proposed ethics training after a company executive deemed it unnecessary.

Other employees were growing suspicious. In May 2004, three months before Thakur embarked on his research, Dr. Kathy Spreen had joined Ranbaxy’s U.S. office as executive director of clinical medicine and pharmacovigilance. A fifteen-year veteran of Wyeth and AstraZeneca, she was there to help launch the company’s brand products division, which planned to create new dosages and formulations of existing drugs. Spreen envisioned her job as that of a regulatory coach to help guide Ranbaxy through the FDA’s intricate system.

At first, the company’s manufacturing prowess seemed to exceed her expectations. She had been on the job a few months and was preparing slides for a presentation about the company’s launch of Riomet, a version of the diabetes drug metformin, when she noticed something remarkable. The data showing the concentration of Ranbaxy’s drug in the bloodstream appeared to match that of the brand name perfectly. Look how good this company is, she remembered thinking. The bioequivalence data is superimposable on the drugs we are modeling.

About a month later, while comparing the data for Sotret, the company’s version of the acne drug Accutane, a formulation the company had secretly wrestled with, Spreen found it almost identical to the brand-name data. That’s when she began to worry. If it’s too good to be true, it’s probably made up.

She knew that data is tricky. Even two batches of the same drug made by the same company at the same plant under the exact same conditions will have slight variations. Test results for a similar or copycat drug made by a different company with a different formula should look different.

With her suspicions aroused, Spreen began asking her Indian counterparts to send underlying data that supported their test results. They repeatedly promised that the information was on the way. When it didn’t arrive, she got excuses: it was a「mess,」they’d be「embarrassed.」She begged her colleagues in India,「I don’t care if it’s written on the back of toilet paper. Just send me something.」But no data came.

Spreen kept thinking that if only she could explain American regulations more clearly, Ranbaxy’s executives would understand. But no amount of explaining seemed to change how the company did business. Indian executives approached the regulatory system as an obstacle to be gamed. They bragged about who had most artfully deceived regulators. When sales of a diabetes drug were sluggish, one executive asked Spreen if she could use her medical license to prescribe the drug to everyone in the company so they could record hundreds of sales. Spreen refused.

When she asked Ranbaxy’s global manufacturing director to send documentation showing that an antibiotic acne gel was made with good manufacturing practices, he offered to send her an「impressive looking」certificate. To Spreen, it sounded like an offer to send her a forged one. She tried to explain that「the look of the certificate means nothing to me unless the FDA says it’s GMP.」

In New Jersey in October 2004, Thakur’s boss Raj Kumar quietly confirmed to Spreen what she had already come to suspect: that crucial testing data for many of the company’s drugs did not actually exist and submissions to regulators had been forged. At one point, she confronted Malvinder Singh, then president of pharmaceuticals, with her suspicions. He told her to be patient and assured her that everything would work out. But for that to happen, the company would have needed to care about compliance and feel a sense of urgency about protecting patients.

That sentiment seemed absent, and shockingly so. In a conference call with a dozen company executives, Spreen expressed her fears about the quality of the AIDS medicine that Ranbaxy was supplying for Africa. One of the company’s top medical executives responded,「Who cares? It’s just blacks dying.」

Like Kathy Spreen, Kumar felt uncertain about what to do next. On a trip back to the United States, he went to see the company’s lawyer, Jay Deshmukh.「I want to talk to you lawyer-to-client,」he said. Deshmukh replied that he represented the company and couldn’t act as a lawyer for him.「You don’t know what’s going on,」Kumar told him, explaining that terrible things were happening inside the company.「I’m afraid for my freedom.」

「I can’t advise you,」Deshmukh said.「I’m not an expert.」After Kumar’s visit, however, Deshmukh made some quiet inquiries and learned about the review that Kumar had launched. It struck the lawyer as extremely hazardous to undertake a corporate self-assessment without proper safeguards. Once that was launched, it would be impossible to undo, and there was no telling where such information might lead.「It’s a bad thing to do with unsophisticated people,」he would later say, as though Kumar had allowed children to play with matches, unsupervised.

For now, Thakur’s analyses moved quietly inside the company. At an executive management meeting in Bangkok, Kumar distributed a spreadsheet prepared by Thakur that listed Ranbaxy’s different markets by region and alphabetically, beginning in Algeria and ending in Vietnam. It had one column for the problems with each drug, another column headed「Risk」 — by which Thakur had meant risk to patients — and a third column,「Action Plan.」Thakur had filled in the column for risk to patients with the words「high,」「medium,」or「low,」depending on how much data, and what kind, was missing from the company’s records.

But at the meeting, the company executives reviewing the spreadsheet had misunderstood the column as meaning risk to the company. In the「Action Plan」column, two executives — the heads of global marketing and regulatory affairs — had scrawled notes in the margins. These made clear that the company would decide whether to discontinue the drugs or temporarily withdraw them from the market for retesting by weighing the risk of being found out against the risk of losing market share. The risk to patients did not enter into their calculation.

At the end of the meeting, Kumar took the spreadsheets with him that contained the men’s handwritten notes. Whether intentionally or not, he was now collecting evidence.

On October 14, 2004, several months after assigning Thakur to dig up the truth, Kumar stood in the boardroom at Ranbaxy’s corporate headquarters in New Delhi, facing members of the scientific committee of the board of directors. His audience included Brian Tempest; Malvinder Singh, then president of pharmaceuticals; the board chairman, Tejendra Khanna, who had served as the lieutenant governor of New Delhi; Dr. P. S. Joshi, a prominent cardiologist; and several others. The company secretary was asked to leave the room.

Kumar showed the men a PowerPoint of twenty-four slides that Thakur had prepared. It was entitled「Risk Management for ANDA Portfolio.」To some extent, it was a work-in-progress, as it still did not contain U.S. market data. But the presentation made clear that in its race for profit, Ranbaxy had lied to regulators, falsified data, and endangered patient safety in almost every country where it sold drugs.「More than 200 products in more than 40 countries [had] elements of data that were fabricated to support business needs,」the PowerPoint stated.「Business needs,」the report showed, was a euphemism for ways in which Ranbaxy could minimize cost, maximize profit, and dupe regulators into approving substandard drugs.

No market or type of drug was exempt, including antiretrovirals purchased by the United States and the World Health Organization to fight HIV in Africa. In Europe, the company used ingredients from unapproved sources, invented shelf-life data, tested different formulations of the drug than the ones it sold, and made undocumented changes to the manufacturing process. The PowerPoint also noted that the fallout from the Vimta audit, which had initially taken Kumar to South Africa, was already drawing the attention of regulators and could do further damage to the company’s reputation.

In entire markets — including Brazil, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Egypt, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Peru, and the Dominican Republic — the company had simply invented all the data. Noting a corporate agreement to manufacture some drugs for brand-name companies, a slide stated,「We have also put our partners (Bayer & Merck in Mexico and in South Africa) at risk by using suspect data in our dossiers.」

Kumar proposed a drastic course: pull all compromised drugs off the market; repeat all suspect tests; inform regulators of every case of switched data; and create a process for linking the right data to the right drugs. A slide entitled「Guiding Principles」laid out what Kumar considered to be the company’s obligations:「Patient safety is our first responsibility. Our products have to be proven safe and effective. A short-term loss of revenue is better than a long-term losing proposition for the entire business.」

Kumar completed the presentation to a silent boardroom. Only one director, a scientist, expressed any surprise about the findings. The others appeared more astonished by Kumar’s declaration that if he was not given full authority to fix the problems, he would resign.

「Can you not bury the data?」one of the board members turned to ask Tempest. No one responded. The silence told Kumar everything he needed to know. Tempest asked for every copy of the PowerPoint to be destroyed and for the laptop on which it was created to be broken down piece by piece. No minutes of the meeting had been created.

Kumar had been certain that Ranbaxy would have to do the right thing after seeing incontrovertible proof that it had done the wrong thing for so long. Instead, within two days of the board meeting, Kumar submitted his resignation. He had been at Ranbaxy for less than four months.「Given the serious nature of the issues we discussed,」he wrote to Tempest, his only choice was to withdraw「gracefully but immediately.」

But the specter of Kumar’s PowerPoint, one of the most damning internal documents ever created by a company executive, would divide the executives for years to come. Inside the company, it would come to be known as「the SAR」(for Self-Assessment Report). The incriminating document was like a slow-burning fuse, headed straight toward the company’s top executives.

Thakur remained behind. But with Kumar’s departure, he had lost his protection. Three months after the board presentation, the company’s internal auditors arrived at his department for what they called a routine review. They stayed for ten weeks, combing through his department’s books and interviewing staff. To Venkat Swaminathan, a member of Thakur’s team, the auditors were the「secret police of the company. We eventually figured out, this was part of the whole case, and Dinesh was the target.」

In late April, the company accused Thakur of browsing porn sites from his office computer. Thakur vehemently denied doing so. Furious, he got his network administrator to pore through the computer records and found that someone in the corporate IT department had logged into his division’s servers and planted his IP address on several searches.

At home, Thakur told his wife Sonal that he would be leaving the company. Though he didn’t go into details and she didn’t pry, he told her that it had become impossible to do his job.

「What are we going to do?」she asked.

Thakur did not have an answer for her. But given what had transpired, it was clear that he had come to the end of his time at Ranbaxy.

On a Thursday morning, Thakur drafted a resignation letter and printed out the data showing that porn websites had been planted under his IP address. The next afternoon he went to Dr. Tempest’s office, where he’d managed to book a thirty-minute meeting.

Thakur showed him the evidence of computer tampering.「I can’t work in an environment where people are out to get me for doing my job,」he explained. Thakur gave Tempest his resignation letter.

Tempest, though pleasant enough, said,「I understand why you’re leaving.」He told Thakur not to return to his office that afternoon but instead to collect his belongings the following week.

Thakur returned on Monday. As the head of human resources stood watch, he plucked a few photos of Ishan from his desk. He was not even allowed to open a drawer or say good-bye to his group. He was then escorted from the building, where Vijay was waiting in the car. He had been at Ranbaxy for twenty-two turbulent months. His departure took less than ten minutes. He was done — or so he thought.

萨库尔的任务 | 印度古尔冈

早晨 8 点 30 分，外面的热浪已经令人室息。迪内希·萨库尔环顾会议桌旁的六名项目经理，看见六张疲倦的面庞。其中几个今天提前几个小时就离开家，好错开高峰期的车流，准时到达公司。他们知道这次会议很重要但不知道议程是什么。萨库尔将给他的团队布置企业尽职调查史上最奇怪的任务之一，但他决定先将真正的原因保密。

「库马尔博土给我们布置了一项新任务。」他开口说道，「他想知道我们能否证明公司提供给各国的所有数据是真实的。这将是对公司全部药品的一次回顾性调查，他想知道在过去 20 年中，我们对提供给各国监管机构的信息有多大的自信。」

他的团队成员看起来都很惊讶，但这项任务又确实没有超出他们的职责范围。他们的本职就是绘制出兰伯西的所有数据图表，因此，首先确定这些数据是否准确就是再自然不过的事了。

萨库尔示意他们看一块白色书写板，他已经在上面画了一张图表。图的纵轴是世界上所有兰伯西出售药物的地区，横轴是各式各样的问题：市场上有哪些产品？它们是在什么时候注册的？注册时使用的真实档案在哪里？支持的数据又在哪里？在那个市场出售了多少批次？它们是在哪家工厂生产的？

萨库尔给每个手下分配了一片区域，并吩咐他们，将公司在那些市场的原始生产数据和提交给监管机构的陈述进行对比：两份数据对得上吗？还是有所差异？那些陈述符合当地法规吗？

在这之前，还从来没有人拼出过公司运营的完整图景。在这之前，兰伯西的内部各自为政。不同的地区由不同的团队负责开发产品，他们相互之间几乎从不见面比对记录。公司的药物是如何获得批准的，乃至是在哪里获得批准的，谁都没有一个完整概念。而现在萨库尔却要求他的团队做一次多角度评估，范围上要覆盖全世界，时间上要回溯好几年。

至于萨库尔自己，他首先拜访了负责法规事务的副主任阿伦·库马尔，阿伦已经得到拉金·库马尔（两人不是亲成）的指示来配合萨库尔的工作。阿伦的办公室就在萨库尔楼上，他带着一脸困惑等来了萨库尔。「其实大家都知道的。」他在迎接萨库尔时说。「知道什么？」萨库尔问道。「知道真实的情况。」阿伦说。他接着描述了兰伯西在一些地区是如何任意妄为的，那些地方的监管最弱，被发现的风险也最低。

「你是说，那些地区市场上的产品并没有充分的数据支持？」「嗯，不是全部都有。」阿伦弄着办公桌上的一份报告随口说道，「我们知道漏洞在哪里。」萨库尔被他的漫不经心惊呆了。「这个情况你向管理层汇报过吗？」「有什么好汇报的？」阿伦回答，「他们都知道了。实际上他们很可能比我还清楚。」

萨库尔心想他肯定是弄错了。他问阿伦，既然申请中包含这样的漏洞他身为审核数据准确性的人员，又怎么能够放行呢？「这就说到根子上了。」阿伦回答。虽说申请文件是他准备的，但是各地区负责法规的领导，比如美国的艾卜哈·潘特，都可以按照自己的喜好修改任何一份申请。他们直接听命于最高管理层，不需要知会阿伦或征得他的同意就能签发申请文件。

萨库尔觉得这简直不可思议。在类似 BMS 这样的公司，法规事务主任对提交给美国药监局的文档全权控制，这样的安排也有充分的理由。负责法规事务的高管一且签发了申请，就表示他们确认了申请数据是准确的。在政府机构的记录中做虚假陈述，这可是犯罪行为。「你告诉我，你说的不是那个意思！」萨库尔追问道。

「美国和欧洲市场太高端，如果被抓，损失太大，所以对那些地区的药物不能公然冒险。」阿伦解释道，「但是像拉丁美洲、印度（和非洲），就完全是另一码事了。」萨库尔听得目瞪口呆：「这些事还有谁知道？」「大家都知道的。」阿伦回答，接着补充了一句，「大家都知道命令从哪里来的。」「就不怕会引起反弹吗？」「都控制好了。」阿伦说，「一切都控制好了。」

萨库尔惊不已，他不得不宣布会议结束，好离开让自己冷静冷静。当他走进自己办公室的大门时，他的行政助理问他：「你怎么了？你这样子像见了鬼似的。」库尔坐在椅子上。他知道品牌药产业内部也有不遵守规章和有失操守的现象。在他离开 BMS 之后，公司的财务总监以及全球药品团队的负责人就成了被告，罪名是刑事共谋、证券欺诈，通过隐購滞销的存货来夸大销售和利润。这些指控后来被销了。

操纵股市或危害股东利益是一回事，被告人可以和美国证券交易委员会达成协议，不必认罪。但阿伦刚刚描述的完全是另一回事。对新药必须开展检测，才能确认它们符合配方、稳定且有效。得出的数据是证明这种药物能救人而非杀人的唯一凭证。但是在兰伯西员工的眼里，数据却是一件完全可以替换的营销工具，他们似乎完全不必考虑这样做会对患者产生什么影响。

这是赤棵棵的欺诈，结果可能危及患者的生命。萨库尔觉得这件事太过严重，让他一时难以接受。但职责仍然驱使他在当天晚些时候回到了阿伦·库马尔的办公室。「把这些事都挖出来没有意义。」阿伦告诉他，「继续调查，你只会被公司开掉。你就告诉拉金都查过了，没有什么好再查的。」「我不能对上级撤谎。」萨库尔说。「你们这些美国回来的是怎么回事？去了几年就当自己是世界道德警察了？」阿伦质问他，「你以为美国那些大型药企就不做这些事？」

在大型药企工作的 10 年间，萨库尔从来没有见过或者想象过这样的行为。他是很年轻，有点天真，但他也很固执，不会轻易让步。「工作还是要做的。我们从哪里开始？」他不耐烦地问道。阿伦不情愿地走到一块白色书写板前，画出一张图表，上面列出了兰伯西在不同地区的品质问题：美国和加拿大最低，欧洲其次，拉丁美洲高点，即度更高，最顶上的是「世界其他地区」，包含几个最穷的非洲国家。「我会从这里开始。」阿伦指着图表上的最高点说。

库尔仍觉得眼前一团黑。他需要的是数字。阿伦把行政助理叫来帮忙。萨库尔那个小伙子，提交给监管机构的文档中，与公司档案不符的数据占了多大比例？那名助理闪烁其词：「这个… 各个地区都是不同的。」「你给我估算一下各个地区的数字。」萨库尔说，「美国大概多少？」助理思索片刻，估算出一个数字：「50% 到 60%？」萨库尔简直喘不过气来：兰伯西提交给美国药监局的文档，有超过一半都作假了？就这样还算品质最好的地区？

那欧洲的情况怎么？「差不太多。」助理回答。印度呢？支吾了一番之后，助理答道：「100%。」他解释说，在印度检测新药纯属浪费时间，因为监管者根本不看数据。因此印度的销售代表干脆自己编一份文档，然后提交给印度药品管控总局（缩写 DCCI，以下简称印度药控局）。

药控局的审批，需要的不是真实的数据，而是良好的人脉。人脉他们是有的，助理表示。这样的欺诈规模把萨库尔吓坏了。想到那些服药的患者，他就感到浑身不舒服。萨库尔告诉两人，他需要了解详细的情况：每种产品要逐年列出，还有每份申请中的作假情况。

当萨库尔手下的项目经理们着手分析时，包括收集数据、开展访谈以及参观实验室和工厂，公司内部森严的等级成了主要障碍。萨库尔的团队不仅太新，而且根据印度企业文化中不成文的规定，团队成员的资历也太浅，不够格向部门领导问话。团队的一名成员负责追查亚洲和巴西市场的数据，他回忆说：「我们是不受欢迎的人。」于是他们只能靠突然到访和死缠烂打来开展工作。他们不打招呼就来到工厂。他们等候几小时就为了能和部门领导谈话。他们驱车几小时前往远处的生产工厂。一点一滴地，团队成员们将信息组合在一起，艰难地拼湊出了兰伯西的移密：公司操纵了生产过程的几乎每个环节，从而快速制造出漂亮的数据，确保公司盈利。

萨库尔团队的每个成员都汇报了相似的案例：在经理的授意下，公司的科学家们将高纯度成分替换成低纯度成分以节约成本。他们修改检测参数使杂质过多的配方也能通过。他们伪造溶解研究。为了生成最佳结果，他们将品牌药磨碎了装进胶囊，代替公司自己的药物接受检测。他们将品牌药的检测结果叠加在自家药物的检测结果上，再用于申请。在一些市场，公司还偷偷对数据流做了混合和匹配，把某一个市场的最佳生产检测数据伪装成另市场独有的数据，再交给当地的监管部门。而在其他市场，公司干脆编造数据。文件作假无处不在。公司甚至捏造了自己的标准生产流程，让美国药监局的调查员对照着检查公司是否道循了规章。有一次，几名员工在文档上写下更早的日期，然后连夜将文档放进一个潮温的房间以加速其老化，以此在视察中糊弄监管者。

公司也懒得隐这种经营手段。这是大家都知道的事，从高级经理、研发主任到负责配方和临床试验的人员，个个如此。基本上，兰伯西的生产标准可以归结为不出事就行。

萨库尔从多年的训练中得出经验，好药不是通过最后检测的那一个。品质必须在生产的每一个环节接受评估，品质就体现在随每一个环节相伴生成的数据里。在生产过程中要记下一系列检测结果，每一个都是通向品质的关键路标。但由于兰伯西只注重结果，规章和要求都受到了漠视。良好生产规范好比停车标识和不方便的弯路。而为了达成有利的结果，兰伯西想怎开就怎么开，一路上绕开路标，重设交通灯，事后再调整里程数。就像公司的分析研究主任后来对一名审计员说的那样：「开展实验的同时记录数据不符合印度文化。」

萨库尔团队的一名成员几个月前刚刚激动地加入兰伯西，现在却陷入左右为难的境地：他没有数据证明这些药物不安全，但也没有可靠的数据证明它们是安全的。他只能下班回家后力劝亲友不要购买兰伯西的产品。

萨库尔每天工作 14 个小时。他试着把每个市场的情况做成电子表格，其中包括申请时和药物一同上交的数据，公司提交给监管者让产品获得批准的数据以及支持这些主张的现有数据。他晚上要在办公室待到 9 点，准备次日的工作计划。回到家里，他还要不顾苏娜尔的反对，走进他位于地下室的办公室一直工作到半夜，将团队上报的数据汇总起来。和平常一样，他对这个项目含其词，苏尔也不问他。他同样没有追问自己那个更大的问题：调查自己的公司，会对他的事业产生什么后果？如果他能后退一步，或许就能看清这项任务潜伏着怎样的危机。

他只是一门心思想了解这场危机的规模：欺诈怎么会严重到这个地步？这种远远超出他想象的行为，该用什么词来描述呢？最后，经过几天的工作，一个词语在他的脑海中浮现出来，只有它能明确地描述他所了解到的现象：犯罪。是的，就是这个。他正在揭露的，是一场在全球蔓延的犯罪。

经过几周详尽的研究，萨库尔将团队关于拉丁美洲、印度和其他市场的初步发现呈交给他的上级拉金·库马尔。那是早晨是 7 点 30 分，库马尔平常上班的时间，两人在他的办公室见面外面的走廊还很安静。萨库尔将几张初步调查表格摆到库马尔面前。它们显示，多种药物根本没有经过恰当的检测，甚至没有检测，也没有数据可以支持公司声称的情况。库马尔一言不发地仔细阅读着。「这肯定不对。」他最后说道。这看起来确实不可能：兰伯西在提交档案前居然没有对药物做过检测？库马尔从来没听过这样的荒唐事。「你肯定是看漏了据。」「我们仔细查了，没有这样的数据。」萨库尔持。

「你们必须回去重新检查。」库马尔也不让步，「这肯定错了。」在库马尔看来，唯一可信的解释是，萨库尔要么看漏了现有的检测结果，要么对调查结果做了错误分析。要不然，就是萨库尔揭露了一种还没有先例的做法。在之后的几周内，库马尔一遍遍地叫他回去复查，乃至萨库尔最后召集团队开了一场会议，好让库马尔直接听听他们的说法。这些团队成员也被这次调查的结果惊呆了，他们面对自己的发现不知所措。迪内希·卡斯胡里尔后来回忆道：「对我来说，腐败是安然那种公司做的事，他们更可能在利润的数据上含糊其词。」文卡特·斯瓦米纳坦起初只预料到公司有「裙带关系和低效率」的问题。他完全没有想到公司的所作所为在危害人们的生命。

在听完萨库尔团队每位成员的汇报之后，库马尔终于醒悟了：公司全球范围内欺诈并危害患者。他将这些信息浓缩成一份四页的报告，呈交给公司 CEO 布赖恩·坦皮斯特。报告的标题虽然平平无奇，叫《在不同国家就不同产品提交的不充分申请文件》，使用的也是公司保证品质的那一套灰色地带的语言，内容却是爆炸性的。它揭露了兰伯西提交给世界各国监管机构的文件中的系统性诈骗。「对于大多数提交给巴西、墨西哥、中东、俄罗斯罗马尼亚、甸、秦国、越南、马来西亚和非洲国家审核的产品，它们要么捏造了不存在的数据，要么用了其他国家其他产品的数据。」

库马尔的报告指出，公司一边削减成本，使用那些市场上最便宜的原料，一边从其他监管更严格的市场调来数据上报，用这种危险的偷换手法来掩盖产品的低劣品质。报告还指出，公司将未通过纯度检测的有效药物成分与检测结果良好的成分混合，直到其符合要求。

报告还指出，在印度及拉丁美洲，公司产品的验证方法、稳定性结果以及生物等效性报告都「无法找到」。简单地说，就是兰伯西无法确认这些市场的药物成分。例如，萨库尔团队收集的数据显示，自 2000 年起在巴西获批的 163 种药物中，几乎每一种药的申请文件包含的都是虚假的批次记录和不存在的稳定性数据。

报告指出，在大多数申请文件中，兰伯西都将小型研发批次（约 2000 剂）「有意夸大」成规模为 100 倍的展示批次，然后对较易控制的小批次欺性地开展关键的生物等效性和稳定性测。结果造成商业规模的批次未经检验出售，将数百万患者的生命置于危险之地。

库马尔还写了一封标记为「机密」的电子邮件，连同报告一起呈给了坦皮斯特。他在电子邮件中说，不遵守规章只是问题的一部分。「看来有些问题在一年多以前就暴露出来了，但我找不到任何旨在陈述或解决这些问题的文件。」在电子邮件末尾，他表明自己最终忠于的并不是公司，而是真相。

他写道：「如果没有充分的数据支持，我不能允许任何信息用在任何申请文件中。」后面还补充了一句，「如您允许，我将就目前我与上述题有关的责任及保障，听取伦敦法律顾问的意见。」在回复中，坦皮斯特向库马尔保证公司会公正处理。虽然形势严峻，但库马尔向萨库尔透露，如果给他权限，他应该可以解决问题。

萨库尔的发现对兰伯西的高管来说并不算什么新鲜事。短短 10 个月前的 2003 年 10 月，外部审计员就开始调查兰伯西在世界各地的生产场地了。那次审计是兰伯西自己下的命令。这也是业界的常规做法：制药公司常常会雇咨询公司审查自家的生产场地，这是一次预演，能看出自身的问题有多显著。这些公司认为，如果连咨询公司都能看出毛病，那么监管机构多半也看得出来。

拉赫曼咨询服务公司的事实核查工作使兰伯西的高管们抛弃了对公司问题严重性的一切幻想。在兰伯西位于新泽西州普林斯顿的工厂里，审计员们发现公司的患者安全部门几乎不起任何作用，培训也基本上「形同虚设」。员工们没有调查患者投诉信的书面工作流程，于是投诉信都积压在盒子里，没有分类也没有上报。也没有文书人员协助他们完成最基本的工作，比如将患者的样本邮寄出去检测。患者在投诉信中常说：「我觉得这和正规药物是不同的。」他们就算发起了查，也做得潦草马虎、半心半意，药品的保质期只写作「未知」，即便他们看看药品的批号就能查出来。

对兰伯西在美国的主要生产厂 —— 新泽西州欧姆实验室的一次审计显示，虽然按要求应该向美国药监局上报不良反应的情况，公司却很少这样做。公司没有一套能在几小时内处理患者投诉的机制，也没有全球卫生干事来跟踪调查患者可能产生的不良反应。拉赫曼的咨询顾问敦促兰伯西在全球范内解决这些问题。但兰伯西对咨询报告的第一反应是质疑拉赫曼的工作时长以及它据此开出的发票。

海外的情形同样不容乐观。在印度北部旁遮普邦一家名叫莫哈里的工厂里，审计员发现工厂对生产记录几乎不加管控，有 20 人有权修改检测结果。有 120 多份不同的批次记录被重复打印过，兰伯西声称那是因为点阵打印机出了故障而且没有更换。如果说良好生产的目标是完全管控，那这就是一个完全失控崩坏的局面。

拉赫曼咨询的总裁后来给兰伯西的一名高管发送了一份内容广泛的改正计划。他的建议包括设立员工培训项目，其中一个模块叫作「树立信任文化培养职业伦理行为和品质第一的心态」。然而兰伯西拒绝开展建议中的职业伦理培训，因为公司的一名高管觉得无此必要。

其他员工也渐渐怀疑起来。2004 年 5 月，就在萨库尔开始调査的三个前，凯西·施普伦（Kathy Spreen）博加入兰伯西的美国办公室，成为负责临床药及药物监督的执行董事。她之前在惠氏和阿斯利康工作过 15 年，这次加盟是为了设立兰伯西的品牌药分部，为现有药物创造新的剂量和配方。在施普伦看来，她的工作是为兰伯西提供法规辅导，引导它通过美国药监局错综复杂的监管体系。

开始，公司的生产技术似乎超出了她的预想。一次，入职才几个月的她正为公司的 Biomet 发布会准备幻灯片，她注意到一件不同寻常的事。这种药物在血液中的浓度数据似乎和品牌药完全一致。她记得当时心想：看看这家公司多有能耐，仿药的生物等效性数据竟然可以直接叠加到它模仿的原版药上。

大概一个月后，施普伦又对比了抗痔疮药 Accutane 和公司曾暗暗下过功夫的仿制药 Sotret 的数据，发现两者的数据几乎完全相同。她这才开始担心起来。如果数据好得不像是真的，那它就很可能是假的。

她知道这些数据中有鬼：即便是同一种药的两个批次，在同一家公司的同一个工厂，在同样的条件下生产，也会有轻微的不同。而另一家公司用另一种配方生产的相似药或模仿药，其检测结果理应是不同的。带着内心的疑惑，施普伦要求印度同事给她发送支持检测结果的数据。对方一次次承诺马上发来，又一次次地爽约。她得到的只有借口：数据「太乱」，他们「不好意思」发给她。她哀求印度的同事们：「就算写在厕纸背面也没关系，总之得发送给我。」但他们始终没有发来。

施伦一直以为，只要她能更清楚地解释美国的法规，兰伯西的高管们就会明白。但无论她怎么解释，似乎都不能改变公司的经营方式。在印度的高管们看来，监管系统是需要绕过的障碍。他们常会吹某人用最巧妙的手法过了监管者。当一种糖尿病药物滞销时，一名高管问施普伦能否利用她医执照给公司里的每个人开这种药，好让记录上多出几百份的销量。施普伦拒绝了。

她曾经要求兰伯西的全球生产总监给她发送一份文件，证明一种抗菌痤疮胶是遵循良好生产规范生产出来的，但对方却提出要给她寄一张「样子很好看」的证书。在施普伦听来，他似乎是想寄一份伪造的证书过来。她努力解释：「证书的样子我不关心，我只要美国药监局说这符合良好生产规范。」

2004 年 10 月，在新泽西州，萨库尔的上级拉金·库马尔悄悄向施普伦承认，她怀疑的事都是真的：对于公司的许多药物，关键的检测数据并不存在，提交给监管者的文件都是伪造的。一次，施普伦找到公司当时的药物总监马尔文德·辛格，直接提出自己的怀疑。辛格要她耐心，并向她许诺一切都会得到解决。但如果真要如此，公司就必须诚心服从规章，并对保护患者有一种紧迫感。

但在兰伯西，这种觉悟似乎是缺乏的，而且缺乏之彻底令人震惊。在次公司的电话会议上，施普伦向与会的 12 名高管表示她很担忧兰伯西供应给非洲的抗艾滋病药物的品质。公司的一名顶层医疗高管答道：「谁在乎就是死几个黑人的事。」

和凯西·施普伦一样，库马尔也对下一步要做什么感到迷茫。一次出差回美国时，他去见了公司的律师杰伊·德希穆克。他说：「我想跟你像律师和委托人那样谈谈。」希穆克说他代表的是公司，不能作为他的律师和他谈话。「但你不明白出了什么事。」库马尔说，他详述了公司内部的可怕问题我害怕会失去人身自由。」「我也不能给你建议。」德希穆克说，「这方面我不是专家。」不过在接待库马尔之后，德希穆克还是悄悄打听了一番，并了解了库马尔发起的调查。这位律师觉得，这种没有适当保障措施的企业自查是极危险的。这种调查一但开始就无法取消，而且谁也说不准查出的信息会导致什么后果。他后来表示：「让不通世故的人来做这件事是很糟的。」就好像库马尔任凭几个孩子在没有看管的情况下玩火。

这时，萨库尔的分析已经在公司内部悄悄流传开了。在曼谷举行的一次商层管理会议上，库马尔向与会者分发了萨库尔制作的一张表单，上面按区域和字母顺序列出了兰伯西的各个市场，从阿尔及利亚开始，到越南结東。其中的一列是各种药物的问题，另一列的标题是「风险」（萨库尔指的是对于患者的风险），还有一列是「行动计划」。萨库尔在患者风险那一列填写了「高」「中」「低」三档，分档依据是公司的记录中缺失了多少数据以及怎样的数据。

但是在会上，阅读表单的公司高管们却把这一列误解成了对于公司的风险。在「行动计划」一列中，负责全球营销和法规事务的两名高管在空白处草草写下笔记。笔记表明公司会考虑两种方案：一是直接中止这些药物的供应；二是暂时从市场上召回它们，重新检测，检测内容是权衡事情败露和失去市场份额哪个危害更大。至于患者面临的风险则根本没有被纳入考虑。

会议结東时，库马尔收回了表单，连同那两个男人在上面手写的笔记。不知是有意还是无意，他开始收集证据了。

2004 年 10 月 14 日，在委任萨库尔挖据真相几个月之后，库马尔站在新德里兰伯西总部的童事会议室中，面对着懂事会科学委员会的各位成员。他的听众包括布赖恩坦皮斯特，当时担任药物总监的马尔文德·辛格，董事会主席、曾任新德里副市长的特金德拉·康纳（Tejendra Khanna），著名心脏病专家 P.S.乔希（P. S. Joshi）博士和其他几个人。公司秘书被吩咐离开了会议室。

库马尔向听众展示了萨库尔准备的一个演示文稿，包含 24 张幻灯片标题是「简化新药申请组合的风险管理」。在某种程度上，这个文件尚未完成，其中还不包含美国市场的数据。但现有的内容已经清楚地表明，在追求利益的过程中，兰伯西对监管者撒了谎，伪造了数据，并在出售药物的几乎每一个国家都危害了患者安全。幻灯片指出：「我们在 40 多个国家出售的 200 多种产品数据中都有为满足业务需求而编造的成分。」报告还显示，所谓的「业务需求」，只是一种粉饰兰伯西最小化成本、最大化利益并哄骗监管者批准不达标药物的种种行径的说辞。

没有一个市场或者一种药物是例外，包括美国和世卫组织采购的用于对抗非洲艾滋病的抗逆转录病毒药。在欧洲，公司使用来源未经批准的成分捏造保质期数据，卖的是一种药，检测时用的却是其他配方的药；更改生产过程却不记录存档。幻灯片还指出，最初促使库马尔去南非的那次维姆塔审计的结果已经被监管者注意到了，可能会进一步破坏公司的声誉。

在一个又一个市场，公司干隐捏造了所有数据，在巴西、肯尼亚、埃塞俄比亚、乌千达、埃及、缅甸、泰国、越南、移鲁和多米尼加共和国都是如此。提到为品牌药公司生产某些药物的企业协议时，一张幻灯片指出：「因为在申请文件中使用了可疑的数据，我们也给合作伙伴（在西哥和南美是拜耳和默克）带来了风险。」

库马尔提出了一个激进的方案：将全部问题药物从市场上召回；重做全部有疑点的检测；向每一个案子的监管者通报调包的数据；制定一套流程把相应的数据和药物关联起来。有一张题为「指导原则」的幻灯片列出了库马尔心目中公司应负的义务：「患者安全是我们的首要责任。我们的产品必须被证明是安全有效的。短期的损失好过整个业务的长期亏损。」库马尔在一片沉默的会议室中完成了报告。只有一位同事也是一位科学家，对他的发现表示了一点惊讶。其他人更惊讶的是库马尔的宣言：如果不让他全权解决问题，他就辞职走人。

「就不能把数据都藏起来吗？」一名董事转头问坦皮斯特。没有人回答。这片沉默让库马尔明白了他需要知道的一切。坦皮斯特下令销毁这个演示文稿的每一个副本，并将制作这个文件的手提电脑拆毁。这次会议没有留下记录。

库马尔曾经确信，在看到无可辩的证据、明白自己做了这么长时间的错事之后，兰伯西将不得不乱反正。但事实并不如他所愿，在这次懂事会议结束之后不到两天，他就提交了辞呈。这距他来兰伯西上任才不到四个月。他对坦皮斯特写道，「鉴于我们讨论的问题的严重性质」，他的唯一选择只能是「优雅而迅速」地离开。

作为一位公司高管创建的文件，库马尔的这个演示文稿可谓毫不留情。在未来的年月里，它的幽灵还将继续在高管之间制造分裂。在公司内部，它将被称为「自我评估报告」（缩写 SAR，以下简称「报告」）。这份指控罪的文件仿佛一根缓缓燃烧的导火索，直接烧向公司的顶层高管。

萨库尔仍留在公司。但是库马尔一走，他就失去了保护。在那次董事会报告的三个月之后，公司内部的审计员来到他的部门，做所谓「例行检查」。他们待了整整 10 周，其间翻看了部门账簿，约谈了部门员工。在萨库尔团队的成员文卡特·斯瓦米纳坦看来，这些审计员就是「公司派来的秘密警察。我们最终发现，这是公司整体计划的一部分，迪内希就是他们的目标。」

4 月下旬，公司突然指控萨库尔在办公室的电脑上浏览黄色网站。萨库尔激烈否认。盛怒之下，他让网络管理员查看了计算机记录，结果发现公司 IT 部门的人登入过他所在部门的服务器，并在几次搜索中植入了他的 IP 地址。回到家，萨库尔告诉妻子苏娜尔他将离开公司。他没有多谈细节，她也没有追问，他只说要工作下去已经不可能了。

「我们接下来怎么办呢？」苏娜尔问他。萨库尔不知道该怎么回答。但是想到发生的种种，他明白自己在兰伯西的日子已经结了。

一个周四的早晨，萨库尔拟了一封辞职信，并打印了能证明黄色网站是被植入他的 IP 地址的证据。次日下午，他来到坦皮斯特博士的办公室，他费了点功夫才预约到和坦皮斯特会面 30 分钟。萨库尔给他看了电脑被动过手脚的证据。他表示：「因为做了本职工作被人打击报复，这样的环境我待不下去。」接着他就递上了辞呈。

不过坦皮斯特态度和蔼，他说：「我明白你为什么要走。」他告诉萨库尔今天下午不要去办公室，等下周直接去取东西。到了周一，萨库尔去了。在一旁的人力资源部长的注视下，他从办公桌上拿走几张伊斯汗的照片。他们甚至不允许他打开抽屉，或者和团队成员道别。他在别人的护送下离开了公司大楼，维贾伊正在外面的汽车里等着他。他在兰伯西度过了动荡的 22 个月，离开时只花了不到 10 分钟。他的事结束了 一一 至少他是这么想的。
