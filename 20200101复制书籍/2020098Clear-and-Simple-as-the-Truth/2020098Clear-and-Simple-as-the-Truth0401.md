「Tufted Titmouse, including Black-crested Titmouse」

(Parus bicolor)

Titmice are social birds and, especially in winter, join with small mixed flocks of chickadees, nuthatches, kinglets, creepers, and the smaller woodpeckers. Although a frequent visitor at feeders, it is not as tame or confiding as the chickadees. It often clings to the bark of trees and turns upside down to pick spiders and insects from the underside of a twig or leaf. The「Black-crested Titmouse」of Texas was until recently considered a separate species.

VOICE: Its commonest call, sung year-round and carrying a considerable distance, is a whistled series of four to eight notes sounding like Peter-Peter repeated over and over.

「Northern Shrike」

(Lanius excubitor)

Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage. Like other northern birds that depend on rodent populations, the Northern Shrike movements are cyclical, becoming more abundant in the South when northern rodent populations are low. At times they hunt from an open perch, where they sit motionless until prey appears; at other times they hover in the air ready to pounce on anything that moves.

Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region

A field guide, in its stand on truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought, and language, fits the classic stand on the elements of style perfectly. Its implied model is one person presenting observations to another, who is in a position to verify them by direct observation.

The reader is not in a library doing research, but in the field looking and listening. Since the field guide assumes a scene in which the reader is in the field, it cannot be written in a style that requires study or rereading. It strives to be brief and efficient. It seeks to present the birds it describes specifically and precisely enough for the reader to recognize them.

The writing in a good field guide is certainly the product of deliberation and revision but sounds like ideal spontaneous speech, as if an accomplished companion in the field wanted to tell you something. There is a symmetry between writer and reader: although the writer knows more about the subject than the reader, the reader would know exactly what the writer knows had he seen what the writer has seen in the past. And the guide's purpose is to put the reader in a position to achieve that parity.

The writer needs nothing from the reader. The writer's purpose is purely the presentation of truth. Neither writer nor reader has a job to do. The writer writes and the reader reads not for the sake of some external task — solving a problem, making money, winning a case, getting a rebate, selling insurance, fixing a machine — but rather for the sake of the subject — in this case, the birds — and for the sake of being united in recognizing the truth of this subject. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge, since nothing could be more irksome to someone in the field than a passage clotted with hedges about the writer's impotence.

The entries in the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region, come as close to classic style in its pure form as anything we have found. In classic style, the model is one person talking to another to present something they both can perceive. A field guide does not perfectly coincide with that model since it is writing, not speech, and the two people are not literally together, but otherwise it fits the classic model closely. Field guides are particularly remarkable for their unfailing refusal to draw attention to their prose. A phrase such as「not as tame or confiding」in the presentation of the tufted titmouse or a sentence like「Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage」in the presentation of the northern shrike is a masterpiece of expression, but refuses to acknowledge that it is anything other than the one inevitable way to present the subject. The prose suggests the same clarity and inevitability as the complex and wonderful but unambiguous and uncontrived presence of the species it describes. There is no more suggestion of deliberation or effort in writing about the tufted titmouse or the northern shrike than there is in seeing one. Writing is assimilated to seeing. There is no more struggle in writing than there is in seeing.

The passages in the Audubon Field Guide assume without hesitation that of course the reader is interested in birds. All details are presented at an equal level of importance. The entire passage is in close focus. The entry for the hairy woodpecker notes that it destroys insects such as wood-boring beetles,「which it extracts from holes with its barbed tongue. Like other woodpeckers, it hammers on a dead limb as part of its courtship ceremony and to proclaim its territory.」The speaker shows not the slightest diffidence or embarrassment about reporting that the call note of the hairy woodpecker「is a sharp, distinctive peek,」or that the western meadowlark and the eastern meadowlark「are so similar that it was not until 1844 that Audubon noticed the difference and named the western bird neglecta because it had been overlooked for so long.」The writer takes the stand that he is simply presenting truth and is being neither cute nor partisan when he reports that「The song of the Western Meadowlark is often heard on Hollywood sound tracks even when the movie setting is far from the bird's range.」There is nothing self-conscious in his matching of language to thought, so there is no hint of fear or shyness in the way he puts his vocabulary to work in descriptions, such as the following account of the western meadowlark's call:「rich, flute-like jumble of gurgling notes, usually descending the scale; very different from the Eastern Meadowlark's series of simple, plaintive whistles.」The speaker never overshoots or undershoots, but always hits his mark. The tone is as it must be. There is nothing for the writer to be defensive about.

「Dragoon Tie」

In the late 16th century, a European mounted soldier who fought as a light cavalryman on attack and as a dismounted infantryman on defense was called a「dragoon.」The term was derived from his weapon, a type of carbine or short musket called the「dragoon.」In the early wars of Frederick II the Great of Prussia in the 18th century,「dragoon」referred to the medium cavalry. The light cavalry of the British army, for the most part, was called「light dragoon」in the 18th and 19th centuries. The term and function disappeared, as did the cavalry, in the 20th century.

The dragoon image used on our exclusive silk twill tie is taken from a design on a 17th-century pewter cap ornament in the Military History exhibit in the National Museum of American History.

An actual scene is unclassic when the writer wants or needs something from the reader. The classic writer never explicitly argues for the reader's agreement, never overtly solicits a reader's vote or ostensibly engages in salesmanship at any level. He does not write to convince his reader of anything or to lead his reader to any action; he does not write for any practical purpose at all. He is simply presenting an interesting truth. It may be that certain judgments or actions must fall out as a natural consequence of this truth, but in such cases, truth alone is sufficient to ensure the judgment or the action.

Writers in professional or business worlds who want something from readers normally use practical style. Technical manuals, sales pitches, political arguments, undergraduate essays, computer instructions, op-ed pieces, and the great range of prose that attempts to get our attention so it can push us and pull us is typically written in at least an attempt at practical style.

There are reasons for this. When someone wants something from us, we are not necessarily disposed to listen, and certainly not disposed to listen to every detail. Practical style is designed to allow skimming and to excuse the reader as much as possible from having to make an effort. If the writer knows that the reader is plowing through hundreds of similar documents, is weary and perhaps even bored, is skimming the writing and for reasons of either incapacity or disposition simply cannot be made to pay attention to the details of the writing, practical style is almost a necessity.

Yet classic style can be extraordinarily effective in cases where the actual scene conflicts with the model scene of classic style. Classic style is a general style of presentation and can present absolutely anything. Adopting the model scene of classic style can have the effect of distracting the reader from the actual scene by suggesting the much more pleasant and distinguished model scene assumed by classic style. This substitution, all alone, can accomplish the writer's actual purposes at one stroke. In the model scene of classic style, someone is simply presenting truth spontaneously, succinctly, and informally. If this model scene can hide the actual scene — which involves some potential conflict of interest between writer and reader, or some reason the reader might not care to give her full attention voluntarily, or some effort by the writer to apply pressure to the reader, or indeed anything other than full disinterested participation by writer and reader in the truth of what is being presented — then the writer has accomplished his goals not by achieving them but rather by assuming a scene in which they are already achieved.

The most persuasive of all rhetorical stances is to write as if one is not trying to persuade at all but simply presenting truth. The most seductive of all rhetorical stances is to write as if of course the reader is interested in what is being presented, as if the issue could never possibly arise. In general, the best rhetorical stance, if one can get away with it, is to speak as if no rhetorical purposes are involved. Properly adopted, this stance accomplishes at the outset the actual rhetorical goals: the reader is interested and persuaded without ever stopping to realize that any effort has been made to interest or persuade her. This rhetorical strategy can be remarkably effective in situations where practical style or oratorical style is more common. It is also much more pleasant than the labor of practical or oratorical style. It flatters the reader by making her an equal, and relaxes the reader by making her part of a disinterested conversation about something really interesting.

Classic style judiciously used to mask practical goals can bring distinction to its subject, its writer, and its reader. The reader plowing through one hundred memos written in practical style may welcome being addressed in classic style, which adopts the stance that reading it is not part of anybody's actual job, but rather something that the reader is interested in and would have no reason to resist.

The exhibit presenting the Smithsonian dragoon tie is an example of classic style used to sell something, but it has one glaring flaw that shows the difference between classic style and practical advertising style. The phrase「our exclusive」is wrong on two counts. First, the classic writer speaks for himself. He does not acknowledge that he is speaking as the mouthpiece of an institution. Instead, he is having a conversation with an equal. Second, the word「exclusive,」although it technically means that the tie can be bought only from the Smithsonian, comes from the lexicon of sales, and calls up immediately in full force the model scene in which a seller is trying to sell something to a customer.

However, if the phrase「our exclusive」were simply replaced with the word「this,」the result would be a passage in classic style. It pretends to be speech. Its purpose is to present an interesting truth. It takes the pose of full knowledge. Someone is simply telling you something interesting about what you are looking at. Everything is in close focus. It assumes a symmetry between writer and reader. Although skillfully written, it refuses to draw attention to the prose. A phrase like「as did the cavalry,」which is an extremely felicitous and understated way of presenting the historical situation in a brief and unforgettable parenthesis, is used as if it came to the writer without deliberation. Of course the reader is interested in the tie, its details, the image on the tie, the materials out of which it is made, the history surrounding it. It follows naturally that the reader might want to have this tie. That the writer is actually trying to get the reader to do something as vulgar as buy the tie is never allowed to surface.

A single revision, substituting「this」for「our exclusive,」turns this passage into classic style.「This」and「our exclusive」are both instances of what syntacticians call「determiner phrases.」The substitution changes nothing at the「phrase-grammatical」or「text-grammatical」level but changes the style, demonstrating that classic style cannot be defined, or distinguished from other styles, by listing its「phrase-grammatical」or「text-grammatical」features. Consequently, a writer cannot be taught classic style by being taught to follow certain patterns of「phrase grammar」or「text grammar.」That is why this book is not an instruction manual in such grammatical procedures. Rather, it is a presentation of the concept of style, the elements of style, and the classic stand on the elements of style. The reader who considers the classic stand will come to see, for himself and through the demonstrations of this museum, that some surface features may derive in certain cases from the classic stand on the elements of style. But these surface features do not constitute the style.

Known locally as Acadiana and more widely as Cajun country, this isolated, dank area is dominated by descendants of French refugees and freed slaves.

Hemorrhoids are actually varicose veins in the rectum.

— First sentence of an anonymous brochure in a medical clinic, 1992

We include this exhibit to suggest the ease with which classic style can be used to present anything. Because classic style is a style of distinction and was used by its seventeenth-century French masters usually for aristocratic concerns, it might mistakenly be thought of as somehow reserved for aristocratic subjects. Quite the contrary. The first exhibit is a front-page report about a current event, the landing of Hurricane Andrew on the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge and assumes that of course the reader is interested in the subject. All details are in close focus:「Known locally as Acadiana.」

The second exhibit is the opening sentence of an anonymous brochure about everyday medical problems. The writer writes as if his subject must manifestly be important to the reader, as if he is talking about the mystery of the Holy Ghost or the irregular evolution of great wine.「Actually」presupposes that the reader is of course already interested in this subject.

Reflexive principles are sought by analyzing a problem or a subject into a whole sufficiently homogeneous and independent to permit solution of the problem or statement of the subject.

— Richard McKeon,「Philosophy and Method」

Perception has some basic patterns. In one of the most fundamental, we orient to a stimulus and then inspect its finer details. The eye is structured to serve this pattern: our peripheral vision is not very sharp, but it allows us to pick out what we want to pay attention to; we then orient our heads so as to bring the stimulus into the central area of the retina, or fovea, which is a more sensitive receptor, suited to inspecting fine details.

This perceptual pattern is basic not only to all our senses but also to our understanding of abstract concepts. We think of conceptual inspection as structured by it: we pick out a concept, orient to it, then inspect its finer details. This is why we routinely say things like,「Let us now turn our attention to the bond market,」or「He would have seen what was going on if he had bothered to look around.」

Since classic style presents a subject to its reader, it is not surprising that it has an affinity for basic patterns of perception and inspection. Often, the classic writer will view her task as getting the reader to pick out a particular abstract subject, orient to it, and then pay attention to its finer details. It is not uncommon for a classic passage or sentence to mirror this pattern at the grammatical level. When a classic passage gives us a title — The Tufted Titmouse, The Northern Shrike, The Dragoon Tie — followed by text, we can understand it immediately through this image schema: the title lets us pick something out and orient to it; the text will present the fine points.

The first two sentences in this exhibit are structured by this basic image schema of presentation. Conceptually, each wishes to present a subject — the ancients or physics — and then to make a fine observation about that subject. Grammatically, each sentence first refers to the subject and then makes a predication specific to that subject.

The use of this image schema will not ensure a classic style. Suppose these sentences were,「The ancients wished to acquire glory」and「Physics has a history of trying to explain reality.」Both of these sentences orient the reader to a subject and then try to pick out a detail. Both take a pose of full knowledge and avoid distracting hedges. Both have as their model scene one person talking to another. Both are patterned on voice rather than writing. And so on. But they are deficient as classic prose, because classic predication involves fine conceptual distinctions, articulated in a precise vocabulary.

Classic presentation lives and dies by fine conceptual distinctions. The distinctions drawn in our first two exhibits, by Michael Murrin and Richard Feynman, appear to have been carefully chosen. Both convey the impression that to be able to make these fine choices and careful conceptual distinctions, the writer must have acquired a vast wealth of knowledge. They do not draw attention to the learning of the writer, and they do not assume that the reader would have failed to see these truths if he had the writer's experience, but they do convey the impression that these presentations can only be made after a great deal of personal experience, although only the appropriate truth, not the experience, is presented.

The first two sentences of this exhibit risk trying to state the essence of something immensely complicated. Each needs its refined observation. Lacking it, they would be no different from such sentences as「In the ancient world, everybody believed the gods decided everything,」or「Sex has a way of making you feel good」: texts that express shallow knowledge or repeat clichés without authority.

The third selection, from Richard McKeon, is disorienting even though, using conventional stylistic checklists, it is not easy to see why. Manuals of usage usually discourage the passive voice, but putting this sentence into active voice will not make it easier to read. McKeon, the model for the Chairman in Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, often wrote prose that, like Jeremy Bentham's, had to be solved rather than read. Some people thought the quality of his writing helped to create his reputation — narrowly based but tenaciously held — for profundity. When a philosopher is difficult to read, some readers ascribe the difficulty of his literary style to the difficulty of the subject. They expect to encounter thoughts inaccessible to ordinary thinkers in language inaccessible to ordinary readers. Feynman thought he could make quantum mechanics accessible to general audiences; McKeon could make The Hound of the Baskervilles as inaccessible as quantum mechanics. But whatever readers may think about the quality of his thought, reading a few pages of McKeon generally leaves them feeling as if they have been caught in a whirlpool. The reason for this feeling of vertigo is that McKeon was one of those rare writers whose sentences do not respect normal patterns of human perception. This one seems to invite us to understand it through the normal perceptual and conceptual pattern of orientation to a clear subject and then investigation of its fine details, but the reader who tries to understand it in this fashion will find that the subject of presentation never seems to settle down. The sentence seems to ask for repeated orientation with no inspection of detail, giving it a peculiarly confusing circular figure.

Marquette had solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, that if the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would name it Conception, in her honor. He kept his word. In that day, all explorers travelled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four with him. La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of meat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other requisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint chroniclers of the time phrased it, to「explain hell to the salvages.」

When I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades in our village on the west bank of the Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman. We had transient ambitions of other sorts, but they were only transient. When a circus came and went, it left us all burning to become clowns; the first negro minstral show that came to our section left us all suffering to try that kind of life; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, each in its turn; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always remained.

— Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi

Classic prose is a window to its subject. This subject is never displaced by the writer. When the subject is a tufted titmouse, a dragoon tie, Hurricane Andrew, physics, the ancients, or anything that could not possibly be mistaken for the writer, the distinction is simple. When the subject is an event in which the writer has had a part, the distinction is subtler. This distinction is standard in classic literary journalism, in which the writer often reports a scene he experienced: presenting his own role may be part of presenting the scene. When A. J. Liebling writes about learning to eat in Between Meals, he does so from the experiences of a young American university student sampling Paris restaurants instead of going to class. When Twain writes about life on the Mississippi, he does so from the experiences of a boy raised on the Mississippi who imagined becoming a pilot on the Mississippi and who in fact became a pilot on the Mississippi.

Twain the boy and Twain the cub pilot are part of the subject; they are not displaced by Twain the writer. We do not start reading a book that purports to present life on the Mississippi and soon find ourselves mired in a discussion of the psychological turmoil undergone by the writer as he tries to recollect his youth before the Civil War.

When a classic writer presents his own experience, it is neither private nor merely personal. The experiences Twain presents are not private: had you been there, you would have seen what he saw, and his purpose is to put you in a position to see exactly that. It is only accidental that you cannot now visit antebellum Hannibal, Missouri to see for yourself. Similarly, these experiences are not merely personal. You are expected to recognize the truth of childhood ambition he presents and to confirm it from your own experience, or from other people's reports.

In this way, Twain the writer and Twain the possessor of entirely personal experiences are never allowed to displace the subject — life on the Mississippi. Twain the boy and Twain the steamboatman are part of that subject and are presented as such.

Twain was a deeply opinionated man, and in some of his books he argues with an unclassic interest or aggression, but Life on the Mississippi is a work of classic disinterest and disguised assertion. The writer takes the pose that life on the Mississippi is interesting and it occurs to him to tell you about it, spontaneously. He writes as if there is nothing to argue about, only truth that the reader will of course recognize once put in a position to see it. In the wicked little history about explorers and priests, Twain passes off his assertions as mere observations. At his best, Twain is a complete master of such disguise, as in the following passage, which actually argues that those who send an invading army cannot understand at a distance what it is like to be invaded. Twain neither asserts nor doubts his central thesis. He simply presents the manifest differences in outlook between Northerners and Southerners:

In the North one hears the war mentioned, in social conversation, once a month; sometimes as often as once a week; but as a distinct subject for talk, it has long ago been relieved of duty. There are sufficient reasons for this. Given a dinner company of six gentlemen today, it can easily happen that four of them — and possibly five — were not in the field at all. So the chances are four to two, or five to one, that the war will at no time during the evening become the topic of conversation; and the chances are still greater that if it become the topic it will remain so but a little while. If you add six ladies to the company, you have added six people who saw so little of the dread realities of the war that they ran out of talk concerning them years ago, and now would soon weary of the war topic if you brought it up.

The case is very different in the South. There, every man you meet was in the war; and every lady you meet saw the war. The war is the great chief topic of conversation. The interest in it is vivid and constant; the interest in other topics is fleeting. Mention of the war will wake up a dull company and set their tongues going, when nearly any other topic would fail. In the South, the war is what A.D. is elsewhere: they date from it. All day long you hear things「placed」as having happened since the waw; or du'in' the waw; or befo' the waw; or right aftah the waw. It shows how intimately every individual was visited, in his own person, by that tremendous episode. It gives the inexperienced stranger a better idea of what a vast and comprehensive calamity invasion is than he can ever get by reading books at the fireside.

A portrait now in the possession of the descendants of the Kiry clan shows Terukatsu sitting cross-legged on a tiger skin, fully clad in armor with a European breastplate, black-braided shoulder plates, taces and fur boots. His helmet is surmounted by enormous, sweeping horns, like a water buffalo's. He holds a tasseled baton of command in his right hand; his left hand is spread so wide on his thigh that the thumb reaches the scabbard of his sword. If he were not wearing armor, one could get some idea of his physique; dressed as he is, only the face is visible. It is not uncommon to see likenesses of heroes from the Period of Civil Wars clad in full armor, and Terukatsu's is very similar to those of Honda Heihachir and Sakakibara Yasumasa that so often appear in history books. They all give an impression of great dignity and severity, but at the same time there is an uncomfortable stiffness and formality in the way they square their shoulders.

— Junichir Tanizaki, The Secret History of the Lord of

Musashi, translated by Anthony H. Chambers

The classic writer is distinguished by the fineness and accuracy of his sight. Often this sight is literally visual — as when Tanizaki picks out the detail of the left hand in the portrait of Terukatsu. Classic style extends the domain of sight to include all things that are perceptible through the senses or through reason. Tanizaki moves seamlessly from observing the visual details of the helmet, breastplate, and tasseled baton of command to observing the invisible: dignity, severity, formality, and uncomfortable stiffness; conventionally heroic posture; and the cultural and historical frame. We cannot see heroism, cultural moments, or severity in the same way we can see a hand, but classic writers assume that we see them in the same way. The truth Tanizaki recognizes and presents is conceived as public: anyone not blind looking at the painting can see the hand and its unusual distension, once it is pointed out. Similarly, anyone not mentally blind can see the cultural frame, the heroism, the stiffness, and the severity, once they are pointed out. Truth is self-evident; the classic writer need only present it accurately for the reader to recognize and verify it.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

— Thomas Jefferson, Declaration of Independence

Ceux qui ont le raisonnement le plus fort, et qui digèrent le mieux leurs pensées, afin de les rendre claires et intelligibles, peuvent toujours le mieux persuader ce qu'ils proposent, encore qu'ils ne parlassent que bas-breton, et qu'ils n'eussent jamais appris de rhétorique.

[Those who have the best reasoning power, and who order their thoughts best in order to make them clear and intelligible, can always argue most persuasively for what they propose, even if they speak nothing but low Breton and have never learned rhetoric.]

— René Descartes, Discours de la méthode

Truth is pure, eternal, not contingent. Jefferson's sentence hangs there like a star. It is true that his sentence is a response to a particular occasion, but he chooses to meet that occasion with something that does not depend upon occasion. What he expresses is grounded in something that was always there and that will always abide: we are endowed with it by the Creator. It is bedrock, not the result of a process. It is not achieved. It is unalienable and so cannot change.

According to Descartes, truth is not only eternal and independent of any occasion, but also potentially available to anyone — there is no principle of exclusion from knowing truth; there is only natural defect, the mental equivalent of being born blind. Being persuasive does not depend upon special techniques available only to an elite, such as the literate, the educated, the urban, the wealthy, the French. Jefferson agrees that truth is democratic. That is why he can view these truths as「self-evident,」able to be seen by all. A Breton farmer who never went to school and cannot even speak French can be more persuasive than a Parisian professor of rhetoric if his thinking is in better order.

Both sentences express a global optimism. Truth will triumph ultimately and for the most part locally. This optimism is typical of American classic style, as an American cultural attitude.

En montrant la vérité, on la fait croire.

[To present truth is to have it believed.]

— Blaise Pascal, Pensées

Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd.

— William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell

Pascal, like Jefferson and Descartes, implies that truth is universally accessible: to see it is to recognize it. Who is it that is made to believe truth in Pascal's sentence? The answer is anybody to whom it has been shown, anybody at all, provided that person has a full human endowment. As in Jefferson and Descartes, the perception of truth is independent of social status, education, wealth, or any other qualification. It is not exclusive. What are the local occasions upon which truth can be shown so as to be perceived? What are the particular circumstances under which it can be shown so as to be perceived? The answer is any occasion at all and under any circumstances whatsoever: truth and its perception are not contingent.

The perception of truth is immediately and completely convincing. A trick can be seen with your own eyes and still not be believed. You can see some things that you are convinced cannot possibly be true, a mirage in the desert, for example. There are many things one can see while still being suspicious of sham. But truth is not like this. To see it is to know that it is truth.

To show truth is automatically to persuade. Truth carries its own sufficient force. In this way, truth is inhuman: it is absolutely self-sufficient; it cuts through all human deficiencies; it needs no help from human beings. All it needs to be perceived is an unadulterated human presentation. As in Jefferson, truth is self-evident once shown.

Truth is perfect. It can gain nothing by being perceived. It is therefore disinterested. It has no motive for deception. It cannot present itself falsely because it does not present itself at all. Self-presentation is for human beings. Human beings are not completely visible; we come with packaging. The package is always shaped by human contingencies, temporary interests, and personal desires, and is therefore suspicious. But truth has no package. Any package given to it is false.

What underlies Pascal's statement is the notion that appropriate prose or appropriate presentation is a window: one can see right through it to truth. It is possible to get the presentation wrong, so that truth is not shown, and therefore people do not see it. The window can be warped or dirty or smoked or blocked and thus be a kind of false package. This is a failure of presentation, not a failure of truth. Truth is never deficient in force or power.

Truth cannot fail any test. It can only be misperceived and mishandled. But nothing is lethal to it. It is immortal. It survives any attempt to deface it. The instruments of perception can be perverted, as can the means of presentation, but truth cannot be perverted or even touched by such corruption. It is independent of human purpose. No one can be so perverse as not to recognize truth once it is shown, though anyone can refuse to look at it or refuse to present it.

It requires discipline, but anyone can present truth, and it often is presented. When it is presented, its effect is complete.

Blake's sentence seems a good deal like Pascal's. Stylistically, it introduces a small unexpected sophistication: truth can never be told so as to be understood and not be believed. A plain style version of this sentence is「Truth can never be told and not be believed.」

Blake's sentence introduces a refinement, a qualification, a meditation on the plain version. It introduces a pivotal conceptual refinement in simple words, transporting the assertion to a level of sophistication that the plain style shuns. Such an introduction of simply expressed conceptual refinement is characteristically classic, so Blake's sentence looks classic.

It is not. In fact, it is stylistically ambiguous. The case is complex and unresolvable. Upon consideration, Blake's sentence can be seen to wobble, but the channel between writer and reader is incomplete; the reader cannot even be sure that Blake meant it to wobble. Ostensibly, it seems to present truth as eternal, knowable, not contingent, of no particular occasion. But if we look closely, it might appear to express something quite different. It never says that it is possible to tell truth so that it can be understood at all. Such a view undercuts the classic premise. Blake's sentence makes the premise contingent upon a precondition that might or might not be fulfilled. The sentence is unclassic not because it contradicts the classic view about truth, but rather because what it presents is fluid. It can alternate between the classic and an unclassic view. What is unresolved in this fashion cannot be classic.

Blake's sentence is like a Necker cube: it contains two different figures, and we can watch it shift back and forth under inspection. It is not eternal. It is not stable. It cannot be stabilized. It looks classic, but that appearance is deceptive.

Il faut exprimer le vrai pour écrire naturellement, fortement, délicatement.

[It is necessary to express what is true in order to write naturally, powerfully, sensitively.]

En vérité [le roi] est admirable et mériterait bien d'avoir d'autres historiens que deux poètes: vous savez aussi bien que moi ce qu'on dit en disant des poètes: il n'en aurait nul besoin. Il ne faudrait ni fable, ni fiction pour le mettre au-dessus des autres; il ne faudrait qu'un style droit, pur, et net. . . .

[The truth is that {the king} is admirable and would certainly merit having historians other than two poets. You know as well as I do what we mean in saying poets. He would have no need of them whatever; it would require no invention, no fiction to place him above the others; it would require only a pure style, clean and straightforward. . . .]

— Madame de Sévigné, letter to Bussy-Rabutin, 18 March 1678

These two passages, by two of the founders of French classic style, are complementary expressions of the prototypical classic stand on truth, which, in this tradition, is more compelling than any invention and is the natural object of unobstructed human intelligence. Invention requires artifice. Truth, which carries its own conviction, can dispense with sophisticated rhetorical or poetic artifice; it needs only to be presented clearly. Human intelligence recognizes truth naturally. Artifice misleads — that is its purpose. It does so by blunting the natural human sensitivity to truth, and in doing so weakens our natural capacity to perceive what is true.

Truth, then, is natural, powerful, and sensitive; the language that presents it best draws no attention to itself. When we talk about someone's personal style, or the style of someone's prose, we often refer to conspicuous attributes. When La Bruyère talks about writing「naturally,」he is thinking about a style that is anonymous in the way nature is anonymous. The format of a modern book is more natural in this sense than a codex, because, when open, a book is bilaterally symmetrical, as is the human body. A duodecimo book「fits」the hands, and while the modern book is a style of setting out a written text, it is so「natural, powerful, sensitive」that only a textual bibliographer, a binder, or an archivist is likely to be aware of it as a style of presenting a written text.

Classic style is like the form of a book; it can be noticed, but it is not conspicuous. It fits truth the way a book fits the hand. If we can imagine a machine or an extraterrestrial, with no knowledge of the human body, trying to design a format for presenting written prose to human readers, we have an image of La Bruyère's concept of the writer trying to be natural, powerful, and sensitive in the absence of truth. The mechanical or extraterrestial design will be no more natural, powerful, or sensitive to a human reader than a duodecimo volume would be to an intelligent creature with the body of an oyster.

Madame de Sévigné, one of the supreme French masters of classic style, had an exceptional literary education. She read Latin and Italian in addition to French and admired many styles of writing. She loved the allegorical epics of Tasso and Ariosto, as well as the classic prose of Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Retz, and her close friend Madame de Lafayette. But poetry, in her view, is not a good model for the portrayal of the real virtues of a real king, because poetry「improves」the truth. In seventeenth-century French usage, poésie meant「invented story」as opposed to「true story」: its distinguishing characteristics were artificial ornament and exceptional invention. She therefore deplores the fact that Louis XIV has no one to record his victories except two poets who acted as historiographers royal in 1678 when he took Ghent, even though one of them was Racine and the other was Boileau. Madame de Sévigné is not rejecting figural forms of thought and language — metaphor, metonymy, simile, narrative, symbol, various forms of condensing and crystallizing — which are generally indispensable in thought and language and have a central role in classic style when they serve the presentation of truth. She is rejecting rather their use as embellishment, adornment, and artifice meant to「improve」truth. For Madame de Sévigné, poetic ornaments are appropriate for talking about Roland or other heroes of epic and romance, but contemporary reality needs nothing more than a pure, clean, straightforward style. Any ornament would just distract attention from truth, which needs no help, just an unimpeded view.

Three days after the first allied landing in France, I was in the wardroom of an LCIL (Landing Craft, Infantry, Large) that was bobbing in the lee of the French cruiser Montcalm off the Normandy coast. The word「large」in landing-craft designation is purely relative; the wardroom of the one I was on is seven by seven feet and contains two officers' bunks and a table with four places at it. She carries a complement of four officers, but since one of them must always be on watch there is room for a guest at the wardroom table, which is how I fitted in. The Montcalm was loosing salvos, each of which rocked our ship; she was firing at a German pocket of resistance a couple of miles from the shoreline. The suave voice of a B.B.C. announcer came over the wardroom radio:「Next in our series of impressions from the front will be a recording of an artillery barrage.」The French ship loosed off again, drowning out the recording. It was this same announcer, I think — I'm not sure, because all B.B.C. announcers sound alike — who said, a little while later,「We are now in a position to say the landings came off with surprising ease.

The Air Force and the big guns of the Navy smashed coastal defenses, and the Army occupied them.」Lieutenant Henry Rigg, United States Coast Guard Reserve, the skipper of our landing craft, looked at Long, her engineering officer, and they both began to laugh. Kavanaugh, the ship's communication officer, said,「Now what do you think of that?」I called briefly upon God. Aboard the LCIL, D Day hadn't seemed like that to us. There is nothing like a broadcasting studio in London to give a chap perspective.

— A. J. Liebling,「Cross-Channel Trip」

Although I have used the testimony of Elyot's letters and writings to document his encounter with the resurgent Scripturalism of the 1530s and 1540s, the context in which he worked was clearly energized by cultural and historical currents that encompassed considerably more than the issues of doctrine, religious practices, and ecclesiastical sovereignty dividing Protestants from Catholics, exacerbated as these issues were. Elyot himself identified the challenges which he faced and met with his literary enterprise as questions about his commitment to the king's and Cromwell's reforming measures or to the「savor」of「holy scripture.」Yet the successful popularizing and secularizing measures which Elyot took in jointly pursuing his course as a vernacular writer and bypassing religious issues are, I think, to be construed as evidence running with rather than against the momentum of a larger ideological movement — in the first place because popularizing and secularizing were real options for Elyot, and in the second place because he was able to make them work. Given our present state of knowledge, even as advanced by Elizabeth Eisenstein's study of the printing press as an agent of cultural change, we are constrained to deal symptomatically and speculatively for the most part with the complex of energizing developments — in which printing, humanism, and the Reformation figured prominently with social and economic changes — that ushered in the modern era of the book.

— Janel Mueller, The Native Tongue and the Word: Developments in English Prose Style, 1380–1580

The passage from A. J. Liebling follows his account of the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 as he experienced it from an infantry landing craft. The style is recognizably classic. Its model is conversation, its occasion is informal, its tone is relaxed, confident, and unhedged, and it takes the pose that it is presentational rather than argumentative. It actually makes many strong assertions, concerning what D-Day was really like, the nature of institutional reporting, and the reliability of interchangeable mouthpieces who speak from something other than local knowledge and according to the agenda of their institutions. But these assertions are disguised as mere presentations of what would have been evident to anyone present on the little craft.

The passage supplies the accidental information that a reader cannot be expected to have: what「large」means in measuring an infantry landing craft, the number of the crew, the way Liebling was accommodated on board. But there is no gratuitous display of arcane military knowledge unnecessary to the narrative. Nothing is merely the product of the observer; nothing depends on being able to share the writer's personal construal of the evidence; everything depends on being able to share the writer's position.

The anecdote is a reporter's reflection on reporting and rests on a contrast between a description without authority and an experience that Liebling can stand behind. Just as the real artillery salvo drowns out the recording of one on the radio, so Liebling's experience, which he shares with the officers on board the landing craft, drowns out the account of the Normandy invasion as related from a radio studio in London. The force of the anecdote depends upon the position of the writer; the details are marshaled to put the reader in the same position, so he can see for himself what the writer relates.

As befits conversation, the sentences follow one another in a sequence that seems natural and inevitable, but this is a very efficient narrative. On reflection, it is a miniature masterpiece of construction. The complete narrative is a figural argument for Liebling's view of news reporting as set against the B.B.C's. It contains within it, perfectly positioned, a miniature version of the same figural argument — the drowning out of the B.B.C's canned account by the real thing. The global figure of the passage and the local figure of the salvos mirror each other like macrocosm and microcosm. Both figures work by giving the reader a highly imagistic narrative from which he will certainly draw the obvious point. Yet the entire passage sounds spontaneous and conversational. The writer has done all the work invisibly, and the prose does not draw attention to itself or to the writer's work.

Classic style used in this way is not in the least restricted to eyewitness reporting. The passage from Dodd we treated in「The Reader is Competent」works in just this way. It includes a wealth of facts and scholarly machinery, but it presents them as accidental information that merely needs to be supplied to the reader in a sufficiently clear fashion: the reader will then make, with Dodd, the inevitable observations. Dodd's passage, like Liebling's, sounds conversational, confident, unhedged. This appearance of confidence comes largely from the way the writer introduces facts and citations with perfect clarity: neither the facts nor their relations to each other are fuzzy. The way the components stand together is fully formed: the writer knows exactly the relationships he means to present.

Janel Mueller's passage on Sir Thomas Elyot appears in her book on late medieval and renaissance English prose style. The passage is unclassic, not principally for local reasons — the side issues that bury in obscurity the figure structuring the passage, for example — but in its conception of scene, cast, and subject. It is a summary of evidence, but assertive and defensive rather than disinterested. The writer presses for agreement while defending from objection and attack, as if the scene and cast were adversarial, not conversational. If the writer obscures what she has to say as she goes along, it serves a strategic purpose: in the end there will be no clear interpretation to which the reader might respond. This style is best suited to juridical scenes and casts, where winning is everything; it is normally incompatible with the obligations of scholarship. The confusion of scene in Mueller induces an obvious strain, resulting in a conflicted form in which bits of scholarly evidence, vague in themselves, are imprecisely connected to each other, and sometimes not connected at all:「Given our present state of knowledge, even as advanced by Elizabeth Eisenstein's study of the printing press as an agent of cultural change . . .」Scholarly asides are scattered at random, offering the decor of erudition without the justification of scholarly argument.

Liebling, who writes about what you can see and hear, and Dodd, who writes about the most abstract concerns of textual editing and historical interpretation, both write as if the subject they are presenting has a clear existence independent of the writer or the writing. Mueller, on the other hand, writes as if her subjects depend upon the writer for their very existence: Elyot's encounter with「the resurgent Scripturalism of the 1530s and 1540s,」「the context in which he worked,」the nature of the「cultural and historical currents」that「energized」that context. That may be why the word「clearly」in the phrase「the context in which he worked was clearly energized by cultural and historical currents that encompassed considerably more than the issues of doctrine, religious practices, and ecclesiastical sovereignty dividing Protestants from Catholics, exacerbated as these issues were」rings false. Clearly? To whom? Could it be clear to just anyone who reads Elyot's「letters and writings」? Could it be clear to Elyot himself? Apparently not. For the author appears to be disagreeing with Elyot's claims. What he did should be construed, she says, in a certain way, namely「as evidence running with rather than against the momentum of a larger ideological movement.」And it should be construed this way, she claims, tautologically, because it is precisely what he did. The「evidence」she offers is「presented」as dependent upon her「point of view,」and the particular view of the evidence that gives it force is not described in a way that would allow the reader to adopt the writer's perspective. Only the conclusions from that perspective are offered, in a manner so obscure as to place them beyond challenge.

Even though there is an ostensible presentation of evidence in the passage on Elyot, the evidence depends entirely upon the writer's disposition. A skillful practitioner in this style can deflect questions about the validity of such evidence, but in this case, there is a marked strain in trying to establish with precision relationships among abstractions that are themselves shapeless and indefinite. In consequence, the whole passage betrays an understandable anxiety that even the writer might lose sight of her own subject. She must reassure herself that what she is talking about is real, that it matters, that her understanding of it is both defensible and significant, and that the reader is interested. It is not surprising that her anxiety is communicated to the reader.

In mathematics, whose normal subject is precise relationships between abstractions, such problems are rare. The objects, while they are abstract, are as definite as infantry-landing boats, and the evidence for the relationships is precise and publicly accessible in a way that the direction of「the momentum of a larger ideological movement」never can be. The borders of such an ideological movement are not public and definite the way the borders of an isosceles triangle — or the dimensions of the wardroom on an infantry landing craft — are. The strain evident in the passage on Sir Thomas Elyot's career as a vernacular writer is the strain of attempting to talk about imperfectly formed conceptions of invented relationships between indefinite abstractions as if they had the precision and public accessibility of square roots or the complement of officers on a Landing Craft, Infantry, Large. Dodd, because he has thought through thoroughly and precisely the relationships and abstractions he wishes to present, can do so as if he were Liebling writing about one boat bobbing in the lee of another. Classic style is perfectly suited to presenting abstractions, but the classic writer, having thought out the features and borders of abstractions, presents them confidently, without recourse to hedges, contortions, and obscurities that undercut a reader's ability to judge the writer's conclusions for himself.

La grande nouveauté technique de l'artillerie a mis quelque temps à faire sentir toutes ses conséquences. La dotation de l'armée de Charles VIII a suffi à lui ouvrir Milan, Florence, Rome et Naples. Cette «invention diabolique», que devaient stigmatiser l'Arioste et Rabelais après lui, condamnait les méthodes traditionnelles, les parades et les offensives de belles armures. Elle rendait, à long terme, inutile la classe aristocratique dont la guerre était la raison d'être, à moins d'une adaptation qu'il lui fallut cruellement accomplir pendant quarante ans de batailles en Italie et ailleurs. Surtout, l'artillerie va amener une révision complète de la fortification et des systèmes défensifs. Les plus grands architectesingénieurs, Francesco di Giorgio, Giuliano da Sangallo, étudient les plans à redents et des bastions articulés qui modifient la physionomie des murailles et par là assez directement celle des villes. Les études les plus saisissantes seront celles de Michel-Ange pour la défense de Florence en 1529–1530. C'est comme ingénieur que César Borgia eut un moment Léonard à son service. On n'a pas encore complètement mesuré toutes les conséquences de l'évolution de l'art de la guerre à la Renaissance.

[The great novelty of Renaissance warfare, the use of artillery, took some time to make its full effect. Thanks to it Charles VIII had Milan, Florence, Rome and Naples at his mercy. This「diabolical invention」as Ariosto called it (and Rabelais was to denounce it after him) put an end to the traditional mode of warfare, to the dashing charges of knights in armor. And in the end it rendered useless the aristocratic class whose raison d'être was warfare — until it had undergone the re-education provided by four gruelling decades of fighting in Italy and elsewhere. The increased use of artillery led to drastic modifications of the fortifications and defensive outworks of towns, and the greatest experts in this field, Francesco di Giorgio and Giuliano da Sangallo, invented a system of indented traces and articulated bastions which radically changed the aspect of the walls and even the layout of fortified cities. The most remarkable plans were those which Michelangelo made for the defense of Florence (1529–1530), and it was in the capacity of engineer that Cesare Borgia called in Leonardo. The extent to which the evolution of the art of war affected the Renaissance has yet to be fully assessed.]

— André Chastel, Le Mythe de la Renaissance 1420–1520

This passage on the introduction of artillery in sixteenth-century warfare and its effect both on large abstractions such as「the traditional mode of warfare」and on tangible things such as walls and fortifications, in addition to its social consequences — things that in other hands might become「the direction of cultural and social trends energized by the complex of military developments」 — is organized by one short point at the beginning and a complementary one at the end. Everything between them is a careful expansion of the first point, at once supporting it with illustrations and examples and preparing the way for the concluding point. Although this passage of just two hundred words contains references to eight people and four cities, as well as allusions to actual fortifications, to plans for new defenses, and to four decades of fighting in two places (one specified, the other not), in addition to the citation of one epithet and an aside on its later repetition, each of these elements occupies a well-conceived place in the discussion. None of them seems awkward or arbitrary. The erudition does not seem gratuitous or strained; it does not obscure the figure that organizes the passage or obstruct its easy flow. The complexity and obscurity of the subject are not offered as a tacit justification for a complex and obscure presentation.

Palabra por palabra, la versión de Galland es la peor escrita de todas, la más embustera y más débil, pero fue la mejor leída. Quienes intimaron con ella, conocieron la felicidad y el asombro. Su orientalismo, que ahora nos parece frugal, encandiló a cuantos aspiraban rapé y complotaban una tragedia en cinco actos. Doce primorosos volúmenes aparecieron de 1707 a 1717, doce volúmenes innumerablemente leídos y que pasaron a diversos idiomas, incluso el hindustani y elárabe. Nosotros, meros lectores anacrónicos del siglo veinte, percibimos en ellos el sabor dulzarrón del siglo dieciocho y no el desvanecido aroma oriental, que hace doscientos años determinó su innovación y su gloria. Nadie tiene la culpa del desencuentro y menos que nadie, Galland.

[Word for word, Galland's version is the worst written, the most fraudulent and the weakest, but it was the most widely read. Readers who grew intimate with it experienced happiness and amazement. Its orientalism, which we now find tame, dazzled the sort of person who inhaled snuff and plotted tragedies in five acts. Twelve exquisite volumes appeared from 1707 to 1717, twelve volumes innumerably read, which passed into many languages, including Hindustani and Arabic. We, mere anachronistic readers of the twentieth century, perceive in these volumes the cloyingly sweet taste of the eighteenth century and not the evanescent oriental aroma that two hundred years ago was their innovation and their glory. No one is to blame for this missed encounter, least of all Galland.]

— Jorge Luis Borges,「Los traductores de las 1001 noches」

The story of the story of the thousand and one nights is perhaps untellable. The cultural provenance of the tales — indian, Persian, and Arabic — is perhaps irrecoverable. The manuscript traditions of the originals are a nightmare that makes the legendary textual problems of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus look trivial. The constitution of the work — which tales belong to it, or at least which tales belong to which versions of it, and in what order — is fundamentally unsettled. It was disseminated through Europe in the eighteenth century through a series of famous translations whose history is at best complex and subtle, at worst unknown.

These impediments to knowledge might paralyze any writer who allowed his style to be influenced by doubts about his capacity to perform. Additional impediments could plausibly be found in the cultural and personal situation of the writer. Jorge Luis Borges was an elite twentieth-century Latin American classic writer, a librarian, a famous erudite, and male. The Thousand and One Nights, by contrast, comes from traditions that are not elite, not privileged, not scholarly, not twentieth-century, not white, not European or Latin American, and not male: the transmission and perhaps creation of the tales were largely in the hands of women. They were subversive tales recognized as such in their own time, intentionally politically incorrect not just for our age but for their own: they present an onslaught against the very notion of ideological engineering as an effective response to the complexity of human affairs. These tales were introduced to Europeans by English and French men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Borges, confronted with this sea of difficulty and separated culturally and personally from the origins of the tales and their translators, nonetheless adopts the classic pose. He presents truth that is generally available. In principle, it could be confirmed by anybody, regardless of cultural identity. He conceives of and presents his subject as existing independently of the writer. He presents it to a competent audience in prose that itself is never allowed to become a subject of the writing. There is a symmetry between writer and reader: like Dodd in considering the textual history of the Fourth Gospel, Borges assumes that in principle anybody could learn what he has learned, and would then see just what he sees. Although Borges is dealing with large abstractions — orientalism, quality in writing, the reception of a text, happiness, the flavor of the eighteenth century, innovation and glory, blame, and extraordinarily complex cultural patterns — he conceives of them as clear and exact. They are as highly defined and visible as cut crystal. None of them depends upon the writer for its existence.

Anything can be presented in classic style, including the cultural and historical situation of the writer and reader, when these are part of the intended subject. Borges presents our situation as twentieth-century readers as part of presenting the truth of these translations and their history. But such matters never displace the chosen subject and never interfere with the performance. Although a classic writer could take as his subject ways in which cultural, historical, and personal situation might make writing impossible, or at least hard, his actual writing would never betray any evidence of the difficulty of which he speaks. He would present clearly, simply, intelligibly, and assuredly the truth that it is impossible to write clearly, simply, intelligibly, and assuredly. He would take the pose that the reader will share his recognition of the truth that it is impossible for the reader to share his recognition of anything.

The Touraine is the heartland of France. It was here, as much as in any other single locality, that the subtle, clear, precise language of modern France developed, and here also, fittingly, that the subtle, fine, expert cooking of modern France developed.

— Waverley Root, The Food of France

Man kann etwas finden, ohne es gesucht zu haben, ja jeder Kunstforscher weiß aus Erfahrung, daß man fast stets etwas anderes findet, als was man sucht. Wer Erdbeeren sucht, weiß, wie eine Erdbeere aussieht, wer aber den Zusammenhang sucht, weiß nicht, wie dieser Zusammenhang aussieht. Die allgemeine Gefahr besteht nun darin, daß Wunsch und Wille, etwas zu finden, vorzeitig im Geiste des Suchenden ein Bild des Zusammenhangs und zwar ein falsches hervorbringen. [One can find something without having sought it — indeed, every connoisseur knows from experience that one nearly always finds something other than what one seeks. When you go looking for strawberries, you know what a strawberry looks like — but when you go looking for interrelationships, you do not know what they will look like. The ever-present danger is precisely that the desire and the will to find something may, in the mind of the seeker, precociously project a connection — one that does not exist.]

— Max J. Friedländer, Die Altniederländische Malerei

The imperfect structural correspondence of painting to literature does not in fact preclude or even severely limit the comparison of the arts. What it does is permit an ever changing set of correlations by painters and writers, who are free to stress different elements of the structures of their art in order to achieve this correspondence. An interartistic parallel thus is not dictated by the preexistent structures of the arts involved; instead, it is an exploration of how these two structures can be aligned. This alignment is part of the overall essential homonymity and synonymity of semiosis by which sign systems and their texts approximate one another and then diverge.

— Wendy Steiner, The Colors of Rhetoric: Problems in the

Relation between Modern Literature and Painting

The passages by Root and Friedländer are classic; the passage by Steiner is not. The difference has nothing to do with the nature of the subjects they treat, but with how those subjects are conceived. Root and Friedländer treat their subjects with a clarity and exactness that makes them appear to be entirely independent of the writers. Steiner treats her subject in a way that makes it dependent upon her for its existence as well as for its expression.

Root treats food and language while Friedländer treats「interrelationships」: food is available to the senses,「interrelationships」to abstract thought, and language to both, demonstrating that classic style is not determined by the nature of its subject. Root says something absurd while Friedländer says something we can all confirm, demonstrating that classic style is not determined by whether what it says is actually true.

What Root says is assured, relaxed, conversational, and classic. It is no less classic for being wrong. The supposed aboriginal「purity」of French in the Touraine is an enduring fairy tale that withstands all contradiction — the shop sign in Tours, for example, that announces「Le Fast-Foud」 — and any claim that modern French cuisine has its roots in the Touraine will provoke outrage from approximately Sens to the southern limit of the Lyonnais. The claim of a relationship between the qualities of a cuisine and the qualities of a language — and, of course, the linguistic qualities Root refers to are qualities of a style, not of a language — must be regarded as doubtful. Many great chefs whose dishes are subtle, clear, and precise speak in a style far removed from that of Pascal and Madame de Sévigné. But Root is not seriously making claims about a relationship between cuisine and language. He is rather offering the disguised assertion that cuisine — as well as literary style — is an important mark of a culture.

Language and cuisine, even if both are limited to their modern French varieties, are large and indefinite domains here confidently subsumed under a deeply entrenched ontological metaphor and so treated as「things」more or less on the order of Friedländer's strawberries. Friedländer, the third director of the great Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, liked to start with evidence of a primary sort — actual pictures — and subsumed his abstractions to this model, treating them as「things」so clear and exact that it is almost impossible to remember that they are abstractions. He noticed, with characteristic mordancy, that a theorist whose abstractions could not clearly and in detail be separated from his discourse produced students who, like their teacher, invariably saw only what they expected to see, whereas connoisseurs like himself whose abstractions were conceptually independent of their discourse regularly encountered pictures that contradicted all their expectations about the painting of particular times and places.

Steiner's procedure is just the sort of thing that raised his skeptical doubts. Her passage, as it reaches its crescendo, is more and more speculative and impossible to verify by looking at what Friedländer would have regarded as common evidence, particular literary texts and paintings. The classic writer, no matter how abstract his subject, will present it as so sharply defined in itself and so independent of the writer as to count for all of us as a「thing,」with the implication that any one of us will see the evidence for it if only we are placed in the appropriate position. Steiner's passage, by contrast, is fundamentally unclassic because it rejects any responsibility on the writer's part to present its subject as a「thing」independent of the writer. On the contrary, the amorphousness of her subject, its dependence upon her for its existence, and the lack of a symmetry between what she and her reader might be able to see as evidence are valued in her writing as marks of the writer's brilliance instead of the writer's incompetence. The final dance of abstractions between「sign systems and their texts」and「the overall essential homonymity and synonymity of semiosis」that contains the「structures」of literature and painting has lost contact so completely with anything available to classic style as to suggest that Steiner's gifts are at least partly oracular. Root is vulnerable exactly because he has presented something so precise and open to our own verification that anyone who has the good fortune to learn both French and French cuisine can challenge him. Steiner, wrapping her speculations in a rhetorical mantle whose most conspicuous colors are those of jargon, suggests she knows things that the rest of us do not, and so avoids root's vulnerability, but at the risk of claiming for herself a kind of supernatural sight and insight. She suggests she has entered into deep mysteries unavailable to the sort of person who might observe that while painting and literature are not in all respects similar, they can be compared, and that a general inquiry into the subject will yield the not surprising result that painting and literature are similar in some ways and different in others.

「凤头山雀，包括黑冠凤头山雀」（学名：Parus bicolor)

凤头山雀是群居鸟类，尤其在冬季，喜与山雀、五子雀、戴菊鸟、旋木雀以及小型啄木鸟等鸟群混居在一起。虽然经常光顾食槽，但它们并不像黑顶山雀那样温顺或与人亲近。它常常紧抓树皮，从枝叶底下倒挂着啄取蜘蛛和昆虫。得克萨斯州的「黑冠凤头山雀」，直到最近才被认为是一个独立的物种。

声音：它们的鸟鸣声经年不断，传得很远。最常听到的叫声，是一连串四至八个音符的鸣叫，听起来像「彼得 - 彼得」，反复不断。

「灰伯劳」（学名：Lanius excubitor)

与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用嚎捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆棘或铁丝网上储存起来。

与其他依赖啮齿动物生存的北部鸟类一样，灰伯劳的活动是周期性的，当北部啮齿动物种群数量较少时，它们在南部的活动变得更加频繁。有时它们梧息在树枝上一动不动，静候猎物出现：有时它们在空中盘旋，准备随时扑向任何移动的东西。

—— 约翰·布尔和小约翰·法兰德，《奥杜邦协会北美鸟类野外观鸟指南·美国东部地区》1

野外指南在真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言上的立场，与古典风格对风格要素的立场一致。它的潜在场景是一个人向另一个人呈现观察到的东西，另一个人所在的位置可以通过直接观察加以验证。

读者不是在图书馆做研究，而是在现场边看边听。因为野外观鸟指南假定的场景是读者在野外，所以它写出来的风格不能指望读者研读或重读。它力求简洁高效，描述鸟的方式要足够具体准确，能让读者识别出来。

一本优秀的野外指南当然是反复斟酌和修改的结果，但它听起来像是理想的即兴发言，就好像身处野外时，身边一位才华横溢的同伴想要告诉你些什么。作者和读者之间是一种对等关系：虽然作者比读者更了解这个主题，但如果读者看到了作者看过的东西，他会和作者一样了解这个主题。指南的目的是把读者放到与作者对等的位置。

作者对读者并无所求。作者的目的纯粹是呈现真相。作者和读者均无任务在身。作者写作，读者阅读，他们不是为了完成某个外部任务 —— 解决问题、赚钱、赢官司、拿回退款、卖保险、修机器 —— 而是为了探讨一个主题 —— 上面这个例子探讨的是鸟 —— 并共同发现这个主题的真相。作者采取了一种无所不知的姿态，毕竟对一个在野外的人来说，最恼人的是读到一篇表达不清又自我辩解的文章。

《奥杜邦协会北美鸟类野外观鸟指南·美国东部地区》中的条目所列的每个观察在形式上接近古典风格，和我们发现任何事物一样。在古典风格中，典型场景是一个人与另一个人交谈，呈现彼此都能观察到的东西。观鸟指南与该场景并不完全一致，因为它是写作，不是说话，而且两个人不是实际的面对面；但尽管如此，已经相当接近古典模式了。野外指南最显著的特点是，从不会让读者关注文章本身。介绍凤头山雀的词语（没有那么温顺，也没有那么与人亲近），或描述灰伯劳的句子（与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用喙捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆棘或铁丝网上储存起来），都是绝佳的表达，但它拒绝承认这是呈现该主题的唯一方式。这篇文章的清晰与必然，与它描述鸟类的存在一样复杂精妙，不含糊不做作。要写凤头山雀或灰伯劳，只要仔细观察就够了，不需要额外的思考和努力。观看是写作的一部分。观察到位了，写作就没什么难的了。

「奥杜邦协会野外指南丛书」毫不犹豫地假定，读者对鸟自然是感兴趣的。呈现的每一个细节都同等重要。整篇文章要逐字逐句品读。长嘴啄木鸟（hairyopeeker）这一条指出，它可以消灭昆虫（如钻木甲虫，「用带倒钩的舌头把虫子从树洞中钩出来。和其他啄木鸟一样，它敲打枯木，既是求爱仪式的一部分，也是为了宣称自己的领地。」讲述者没有显露丝毫的羞怯或尴尬，无论描述长嘴啄木鸟是「一次敏锐而特殊的匆匆一瞥」，还是西美草地鹨（western meadowlark）和东美草地鹨（eastern meadowlark）「如此相似，直到 1844 年奥杜邦才发现两者的差异，因为这种疏忽导致给西美草地鹨起名为‘neglecta'。当作者说「好莱坞电影配乐中经常出现西美草地鹨的歌声，哪怕电影取景地不属于西美草地鹨的活动范围」，作者的立场只是呈现真相，没有故作精明也没有任何偏祖。作者用语言表达思想时没有一丁点局促不安，所以词句不会流露出任何忐忑或羞怯。又如下面这句对西美草地鹨叫声的描述：「咯咯的音符交杂一起，像长笛一样圆润洪亮，常用降调；和东美草地鹨一阵阵的简单哀鸣不一样。」讲述者从不言过其实，也不会言不尽意，而总是恰如其分。他们说话的口吻是它本该如此。作者不需要捍卫什么。

非古典场景

选段 4-2

「龙骑兵领带」

十六世纪后期，欧洲有种士兵进攻时骑马作战，防御时下马成为步兵，叫作「龙骑兵」（dragoon）。这种叫法源于他们的武器，一种称作「dragoon」的卡宾枪或短管滑膛枪。在十八世纪普鲁士大帝腓特烈二世的早期战争中，「龙骑兵」指的是中型骑兵。英国军队的轻骑兵在十八、十九世纪时，多数情况下被称为「轻型龙骑兵」。和骑兵一样，轻型龙骑兵这种说法和相应功能在二十世纪也消失了。

这款斜纹丝绸领带为我馆特有，领带上的龙骑兵形象，源自美国国家历史博物馆军事历史展览中一顶十七世纪锡制帽装饰品上的图案。

—— 1991 年美国国家历史博物馆礼品店小卡片上介绍龙骑兵领带的文字

当作者渴望或需要从读者那里得到什么时，实际场景不是古典场景。古典风格作者不会直接争取读者的认同，也从未公开征求读者的支持，或明面上从事任何层面的推销活动。他写作不是为了让读者相信什么，也不是为了引导读者做什么；他写作没有任何实际目的。他只是呈现一个有趣的真相。这种真相有可能自然导向某些判断或行动，但在这种情况下，真相本身就足以让读者做出这种判断或行动。

当专业领域或商业领域的作者想从读者那得到什么时，通常用实用风格写作。技术手册、商品推销、政治争论、本科生论文、计算机指令、社论专栏以及各种想引起我们注意并想左右我们选择的文本，通常会写成实用风格，至少是尝试用这种风格。

这是有原因的。当有人想从我们这得到什么时，我们不一定会愿意听，更别说听每一个细节。实用风格允许略读，并要尽可能节省读者的精力。如果作者知道，读者正在读上百份类似的文件，已经开始疲倦甚至厌烦了，并且开始略读某些部分，不管是看不了还是不想看，就是没办法逐一细读，这时候必然要用实用风格。

即使是与古典场景对应的实际场景，使用古典风格的效果也很显著。古典风格是一种通用的呈现型风格，任何东西都可以呈现。采用古典风格的典型场景，可以把读者带到更愉快、更高尚的场景中，弱化实际场景。这种场景转换，能立即达到作者的实际目的。在古典风格的典型场景中，某个人只是用一种简单日常的即兴方式呈现真相。在实际场景中，作者和读者之间可能存在潜在的利益冲突，或者读者因为某些原因可能不乐意主动投入自己全部注意力，又或者作者在尝试对读者施予压力，总之，作者和读者不能完全客观地参与到所呈现的真相中。如果古典风格的典型场景能隐藏这些实际场景，作者不用额外做什么就能达到他的目标，因为他设定的场景已经实现这些目标了。

所有修辞立场中最有说服力的是，写出来的好像不是为了说服而只是为了呈现真相；所有修辞立场中最吸引读者的是，写出来的好像读者当然对所呈现的事物感兴趣，好像这个问题不值一提。如果能做到的话，通常最好的修辞立场是，让说话听起来不带任何修辞目的。正确应用这种立场可以一开始就实现实际修辞目的：读者感兴趣或被说服，压根没想到是作者刻意引导使然。把这种修辞策略用到经常使用实用风格或演说风格的情境中，效果很显著。而且比起实用风格或演说风格的刻意，这种策略更令人愉悦。平等相待让读者感到被尊重，客观地谈论真正有趣的事物让读者感到放松。

用古典风格隐藏实际目的相当明智，由此更能深化它的主题、作者和读者之间的关系。读者要是埋头阅读一百篇实用风格的备忘录，可能更希望它们被写成古典风格，因为古典风格从不把阅读当作任何人必须完成的任务的一部分，而是把阅读当作读者感兴趣且无法抗拒的事情。

这段呈现史密尼森博物馆龙骑兵领带的话，示范了如何用古典风格推销商品，但它有一处明显的瑕疵，即透露了古典风格和实用广告风格的差别。「我馆特有」这个词没用好：第一，古典风格作者只为自已说话。他不承认自己作为某机构代言人。相反，他在跟别人平等地对话。第二，「特有」这个词，尽管从词义上指只有在史密尼森博物馆才能买到这条领带，但它属于销售用语，容易让人立即联想到销售员向顾客兜售商品的典型场景。

但是，如果将「我馆特有」这个词换成「这条」，这段文字就具有古典风格了。它假装在说话。它的目的是呈现有趣的真相。它采取的是无所不知的姿态。某人只是和你讲你所看之物的有趣之处。你会看到每个细节。作者与读者之间是一种对等关系。尽管写作技巧了得，它并没有把关注点引向文本本身。「和骑兵一样」这样简洁易记的短句，用插入语的形式恰如其分、轻描淡写地呈现历史情境，就像作者信手拈来一样。当然，读者有兴趣了解领带及其细节、图像和制作材料，以及相关历史。读者可能想要这条领带也是很自然的事情。作者实际上在诱导读者做某些事情，如买领带这种庸俗行为，但绝不能让这种意图显露出来。

「这条」和「我馆特有」都是语法学家所说的「限定词」。这个替换没有改变「短语语法」或「文本-语法」的层面的内容，但改变了风格，说明只是列出「短语语法」或「文本-语法」的特征，无法定义或从其他风格中区分出古典风格。因此，模仿「短语语法」或「文本语法」的某些范例无法让一位作者学会古典风格。这就是为什么本书不是一本语法指导手册。它讲述的是风格概念、风格要素及古典风格对风格要素的立场。思考过古典风格的读者会发现，可以从本博物篇展示的文本中看出来，在某些场合，古典风格对风格要素的立场可能会表现出相应的表面特征，但这些表面特征并不构成风格。

呈现

主题不限

选段 4-3

当地人称它为阿卡迪亚，但它有个更广为人知的名字，叫嘉郡，这个与世隔绝、阴冷潮湿的地区居住着法国难民和获得自由的奴隶的后代。

——《洛杉矶时报》，1992 年 8 月 28 日 

痔疮实际上是直肠静脉曲张。

—— 一家医疗诊所匿名小册子上的第一句话，1992 年

我们摘录这个选段是想说明呈现任何事物都能用到古典风格。因为古典风格是一种非常优秀的风格，而且在十七世纪法国的文体大师常用古典风格写贵族话题，因此古典风格被误认为只适用于写与贵族相关的主题。其实，恰恰相反，第一个选段是时事头条，报道安德鲁飓风在墨西哥湾沿岸的路易斯安那州登陆。作者以一种全知姿态，认为读者理所当然对这个主题感兴趣。每个细节都值得关注：「当地人称它为阿卡迪亚」。

第二个选段是一本佚名日常医疗小册子上开头的话。作者写出来就好像这个主题明显对读者很重要，好像他在谈论圣灵的奥秘或美味的葡萄酒无规律的演变历史一样。「实际上」这个词，预设了读者当然对这个主题感兴趣。

从主题到细节

选段 4-4

古希腊人希望为荷马诸神的丑闻辩解。

—— 迈克尔·默林，《寓言史诗》3

物理学素有将许多现象合成几个理论的历史。

—— 理查德·P. 费曼，《QED：光和物质的奇异性》4

自反原则被获得的方式是，把某个问题或主题分析成足够同质又独立的整体，用以解决问题或阐述主题。

—— 理查德·麦克科恩，《哲学与方法》5

视觉有一些基本模式。其中，最基本的一个模式是，我们被某种刺激物吸引，然后开始观察更细微的细节。眼睛的构造正是为了服务这种模式：我们的周边视觉不太敏锐，但可以让我们选定想关注的东西；然后我们转动头部，让刺激物进入视网膜的中央区，即中央凹，这是一个更敏感的接收器，适宜观察细微的东西。

这种感知模式，不仅是我们所有感官认识的基础，也是我们理解抽象概念的基础。我们认为概念观察也遵循这种结构：我们选定一个概念，投入注意力，然后观察它更细微的细节。因此我们常常说这样的话：「现在让我们把注意力转向债券市场」，或者「他如果到处看看，他会看到发生了什么」。

因为古典风格向读者呈现主题，所以毫不奇怪古典风格会偏好这种感知和观察的基本模式。古典风格作者常常将自己的任务视为，让读者选定一个特定的抽象主题，投入注意力，然后关注它更细微的细节。通常，一篇古典文章或一个古典句子的语法结构也会契合这种模式。一篇古典文章在正文前会有一个标题 —— 凤头山雀、灰伯劳、龙骑兵，这种意象图式可以帮我们快速理解文章：标题让我们选定一个事物并注意到它，正文会呈现细微之处。

选段 44 中的前面两句用的是这种基本的呈现型意象图式结构。在概念上，每段都希望呈现一个主题 —— 古希腊人或物理学 —— 然后更细致地观察这个主题。在语法上，每段先是指明主题，然后对该主题做具体陈述。

有意象图式并不意味着是古典风格。假设这几个句子写的是：「古希腊人希望获得荣耀」和「物理学素有试图解释现实的历史」。这两个句子都将读者引向一个主题，接着尝试选了一个细节。两者都是无所不知的姿态，没有拐弯抹角地分散读者的注意力。两者都是一个人与另一个人交谈的典型场景，并且两者都是模仿声音而非写作。诸如此类还有很多。但要达到古典文章的标准，它们仍有瑕疵，因为古典表达是用准确的词汇表达细微的概念差异。

古典呈现的成败在于是否体现细微的概念差异。迈克尔·默林和理查德·费曼的两个选段，看起来是仔细斟酌过这种差异的。从这两段话可以看出来，要做出如此细致的选择和概念区分，作者必须掌握丰富的知识。它们都没有引起读者关注作者本人的学识，也没表示出即使读者有作者一样的体验也无法看到这些真相，但两者确实表达了这种象：只有具备丰富的个人体验才能做出这些呈现，尽管只是呈现合理真相而非个人经验。

选段 4-4 的前两句尝试阐述一些极其复杂的事物的本质。每段都需要细致入微的观察。没有这种观察，它们与「在古代世界，每个人都相信神决定一切」或「性以某种方式让你感觉良好」这些句子没什么区别：表达的都是肤浅的知识，或者是没有根据的陈词滥调。

选段 4-4 的第三句出自理查德·麦克科恩，主题不明，尽管逐条比对传统的风格清单，但仍很难看出原因。惯用法手册通常不鼓励使用被动语态，但这个选段即使改成主动语态，也不好读。

麦克科恩是罗伯·波（Robert Pirsig）《禅与摩托车维修艺术》（Zen and the Art of Motorcycle）这本书中「主席」的榜样，像杰里米·边沁一样，他写文章是为了让人解谜而不是供人阅读。一些人认为这种写作特征造就了 —— 虽狭隘但深入人心的 —— 他那深奥的文风。当一位哲学家的作品很难读懂时，一些读者认为话题本身的困难导致了他的文学风格不易理解。他们理所当然地认为他的思想非一般人能懂，他的语言也非一般人能读懂。费曼认为，他可以让普通读者理解量子力学：相反，麦克科恩可能会把《巴斯克维尔的猎犬》（The Hound of the Baskervilles）写得像量子力学一样难懂。但是无论读者如何看待他的思想特点，阅读几页麦克科恩的文章确实常常让人觉得好像陷入了漩祸一样。读者之所以晕头转向，是因为麦克科恩是极少数不遵循人类常规感知模式的作家之一。这个选段看起来是在引导读者使用常规的感知模式和概念模式来理解 —— 指向一个清晰的主题，然后深入研究其他细节 —— 但读者尝试用这种方式理解时会发现，要呈现的主题看起来从未确定过。这句话好像在反复确认主题，而没有深入细节，犹如某种令人费解的循环论证。

别让叙事作者取代主题

选段 4-5

马奎曾经在圣母玛利亚无原罪受胎节的宴席上庄严地发誓，只要圣母玛利亚允许他发现这条大河，他就用「受胎」这名字为河命名，并以此来纪念圣母。他实现了他的诺言。那时候所有的探险家在探险旅行时都带着传教士，德·索托的身边就有二十四个传教士，拉萨尔身边也有几位传教士。虽然探险队时常缺少肉食，衣服也显然不足，而用于做弥撒的设施和必需品却一应俱全，他们永远准备好这些物品。在当年的编年史中有一条颇为奇妙的说法，即这些物品是「为了向未开化的野人阐明地狱情形的」。远在我孩提时代，与我同住在密西西比河西岸村子里的同代伙伴，都怀抱着一个永恒不变的远大志向。这个志向就是当一名轮船上的水手。我们也有其他各种各样的一时性的志向，所有那些志向不过是片刻的虚幻。比如，马戏团来到这里又走了之后，会留给我们一些火辣辣的思绪 —— 想去当个小丑；又如，黑人乐团第一次来到这里演奏时，也激起过我们的幻象 —— 想去过这种生活。不时有一种希望出现在脑海之中，那就是：如果我们活着，为人正派，上帝便允许我们去当海盗。然而所有这些远大志向都会一个个地轮流破灭，唯独「当一名水手」的志向会常驻心间。

—— 马克·吐温，《密西西比河上的生活》① 6

① 汉译文出自罗志野翻译版本，本书其他《密西西比河上的生活》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

古典文章是观看主题的窗户。主题从不会被作者本人替代。当主题是凤头山雀、龙骑兵的领带、安德鲁飓风、物理学、古希腊人或任何不可能混淆为作者本人的主题时，很容易区分。如果主题是作者曾经参与其中的某个事件，两者的区分会微妙起来。这种区分在古典风格的叙事性新闻（literary journalism）中极为常见，作者常常报道他经历的场景：呈现自己的角色是呈现场景的一部分。李伯龄（A. J. Liebling）《在巴黎的餐桌上》（Betveen Meals）这本书写学习怎么吃时，他写了一名年轻的美国大学生逃课去各种法国餐厅品尝美食。吐温写《密西西比河上的生活》时，他写了一个在密西西比河长大的男孩幻想成为领航员，后来他真的成了密西西比河上的领航员。




男孩吐温和少年领航员吐温都是主题的一部分；他们没有被作者吐温替代。我们不是在阅读一本开头声称讲密西西比生活，到作者回忆美国南北战争前的青春岁月时，却发现自己陷入作者个人内心动荡的书。

当一位古典风格的作家呈现自己的经历时，所呈现的是既非私密也非纯个人的东西。吐温呈现的经历并不私密：如果你在那里，你会看到他看到的，而他的目的是将你放在刚好能看到的位置上。你现在无法参观密苏里州的汉尼拔镇纯属偶然。同样，这些经历不是纯个人的。你可以看出他呈现的童年野心的真相，也可以通过自己的经历或别人的讲述确认这个真相。

因此，作家吐温和拥有这些个人经历的吐温，从未取代文章的主题 —— 密西西比河上的生活。男孩吐温和蒸汽船领航员吐温是这个主题的一部分，也是这样被呈现出来的。

吐温是一个固执己见的人，他有些书的观点不够古典，带着某种利益倾向或好斗情绪，但《密西西比河上的生活》是一部古典风格作品，不关心利益，有断言但没有争辩。作者的姿态是：密西西比河上的生活新奇有趣，他刚好想着告诉你就即兴说了起来。他写得好像没有什么要论证的，只需讲述事实，读者只要在他那个位置立即就能看出来。讲述探险家和牧师的那段邪恶小史时，吐温把他自己的断言表达成纯粹的观察。吐温最好的一些作品把这种隐藏手法用得特别娴熟，就如下面一段话，吐温实际论证的观点是：派遣军队入侵的一方不可能对被入侵的那一方感同身受。吐温既不断定也不怀疑他的核心论点。他只是呈现出北方人和南方人在观点表达上的显著差异。

在北方，一般社会交际当中，你一个月会听到一次有关战争的谈话，有时候也会多到一个星期提到一次战争的事。但是作为特殊的题材，战争这个话题在很久之前就不走运了。之所以这样，其理由是很充足的。今天如果有六位先生在一起吃饭，通常他们当中有四个人，或者有五个人，根本就没有上过战场。所以谈论战争的可能性只是二比四或者一比五，今天晚上战争这个话题看来就无法进行了。不过谈论这一话题的机会还是有的，但是谈论的时长很短。如果在这行人中间再添上六位妇女，也就是说添了六位目睹极少战争可怕场面的人，她们就无法谈论很多年前的战争情况，你要是提到战争，要不了一会儿，她们对这个话题便感到厌烦。

在南方的情况完全不一样，那里你遇到的每一个男人都经历过战争，你遇到的每一个女人也都见到过战争。战争是他们最主要的谈话主题，一谈到战争，兴趣便来了，百谈不厌。而其他话题却是一谈便结束，是暂时的。一提到战争，原来沉闷的伙伴便兴高采烈起来，舌头一溜便谈开了，这时其他一切话题便显得毫无生气。在南方，战争就是其他地方的耶稣纪元，他们是以战争作为开始的日子的。一天到晚你都会听到什么事情是战争一开始发生的，在战争中发生的，在战前发生的，在战后发生的，或者是在战前、战后的两年、五年、十年发生的。这就说明，战争跟每一个经历过重大事件的人都联系得那么紧密，这就使得没有经历过的外地人对战争所带来的灾祸有了一个明确的看法，比他坐在炉边读描写战争的书要强得多。7

让抽象看得见

选段 4-6

瞻仰今桐生家后代子孙所收藏之辉胜像，南蛮胴搭配黑革连缀的铠甲袖，铠甲下连护腿甲；头盔两旁有宛如水牛角的巨大装饰，右手持朱红指挥扇，置于膝上的左手大张，拇指按着大刀刀鞘，足蹬毛靴，双脚盘于虎皮垫上。若除去甲胄，也许能一窥体格，可惜如此装扮仅能瞧见容貌。战国时代的英雄画像大多像这样全副武装。观看历史图鉴常出现的本多平八郎、神原康政等人之像，都非常类似，无不看起来威风凛凛，又让人觉得有点怒气冲天，仿佛旁人近身不得的紧绷模样。

—— 谷崎润一郎，《武州公秘话》，英文翻译：安东尼·钱伯斯 08

① 汉译文出自张蓉蓓翻译版本。—— 译者注

古典风格作者的优秀在于细致敏锐的眼光。从字面上来讲，这种眼光常常是视觉上的，如上面谷崎润一郎观察辉胜像左手的细节。古典风格的眼光是一种引申义，包括通过感官或通过推理观察到的任何事物。谷崎润一郎先是观察头盔、胸甲和指挥扇这些看得见的细节，接着观察了无法直接看到的细节：威风凛凛、怒气冲天、近身不得、不舒适的紧绷感；传统的英勇姿态；文化历史框架。我们不能像看一只手一样看到英雄主义、文化场合或冲天怒气，但是古典风格作者假定我们可以用同样的方式观察到。谷崎润一郎看到并呈现出来的真相是公开的：一旦指出来，任何没有视力障碍的人都能看到这只手及其异常粗大的样子。同理，一旦指出来，任何没有智力障碍的人都会看到文化框架、英雄主义、紧绷感和怒气。真相不言而喻，古典风格作者只需如实呈现，让读者自己观察和验证即可。

真相

真相终将胜利

选段 4-7

我们认为以下真理是不言而喻的：人人生而平等；人人都享有上帝赋予的某些不可转让的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。

—— 托马斯·杰斐逊，《独立宣言》

一个人只要推理能力极强，极会把自己的思想安排得明白易懂，总是最有办法使别人信服自己的论点的，哪怕他嘴里说的只是粗俗的布列塔尼土话，哪怕他从来也没有学过修辞学。

—— 勒内·笛卡儿，《谈谈方法》① 9

① 汉译文出自王太庆翻译版本，本书其他《谈谈方法》选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

「真相是纯粹的、永恒的，不是偶然的。」杰斐逊的话有如一颗明星悬于天上。他的话确实是对特定场合的回应，但他的回答既可使用于该场合，也能独立于该场合。他表达的是永存不变的事物：造物主把它赋予我们。它是基本事实，而非某个过程的结果。它不是获得的。它不可转让，所以无法改变。

根据笛卡儿的说法，真相不仅是永恒的，而且是独立于任何场合的，任何人都有可能知道 —— 原则上没有例外，除非是天然的缺陷，生下来就有心智障碍。令人信服无须具备精英专属的特殊能力，比如读写能力、良好的教育、城市居民、富裕家庭等。杰斐逊也认同真相是民主的，所以他才会认为「这些真相不言而喻」，所有人都能看到。一个没有上过学，不会说法语，只会说布列塔尼语的农民可以比一位巴黎的修辞学教授更具有说服力，如果他的思考比修辞学教授的更有逻辑。

两个选段都表达了一种整体的乐观态度。真相终将胜利，大部分当即就胜利。这种乐观是「美国化」的一种态度，是典型的「美国古典风格」。

真相：看到就会相信

选段 4-8

呈现真相，就是让人相信它。

—— 布菜兹·帕斯卡，《沉思录》10

真相不可能说出来能让人理解，不能让人相信。

—— 威廉·布菜克，《天堂与地狱的婚烟》11

和杰斐逊和笛卡儿一样，帕斯卡认为：「人人都可以知道真相：看到就会认出来。」帕斯卡的这句话中，让什么人相信真相？答案是看到真相的任何人，凡是身心健全的人都会相信真相。如杰斐逊和笛卡儿说的那样，观察真相与社会地位、教育、财富或任何其他资格都无关。它不是谁的专属。在什么样的场合，真相可以呈现出来让人看到？在什么样的情境，真相可以呈现出来让人看到？答案是在任何场合、任何情境下真相都可以呈现出来让人看到：因为真相与对真相的观察不依情况而变。

真相一旦被看到，就会立即让人完全信服。诡计也可以被亲眼看到，但你不会相信。你可以看到一些你相信不可能存在的东西，比如沙漠里的海市蜃楼。许多事情即使看到，也仍然被怀疑是假的。但是，真相不是这样，看到它就知道它是真相。

呈现真相的过程就是说服的过程。真相自有足够的力量。从这点来看，真相很不人道：它完全自给自足；它克服了一切人类缺点；它不需要人类的任何帮助。要让它被看到，只需纯粹地呈现。正如杰斐逊所言，一且指出，真相不言而喻。

真相完美无缺。发现真相不会带来什么利益，因此它不偏不倚。它没有行骗动机。它无法虚伪地表现自己，因为它没有任何自我表现。自我表现只有人类才有。人并非完全可见，因为被包装着。这种包装总是受突发事件、一时利益和个人欲望的影响，因此不值得信赖。但真相没有包装。真相被包装后就不再是真相。

帕斯卡的话隐含着一个前提，适宜的文章或适宜的呈现是一扇窗户：透过这扇窗可以直达真相。呈现有可能出错，以至于真相无法展示出来，所以人们看不到真相。窗户可能翘曲、变脏或模糊，变成一种虚假的包装。这是呈现的失败，而不是真相的失败。真相从不缺乏力量或说服力。

真相总是能够经得起考验。它顶多被误解和误用。但没有什么对真相是致命的。真相是永恒的，任何试图玷污真相的行为注定失败。就如呈现的方式会被歪曲一样，观察的方式也可能被歪曲，但真相不可能被歪曲，甚至不会受这种歪曲的影响。它独立于人类的目的。尽管一个人可以拒绝观看真相或拒绝呈现真相，但不可能看不到被展示出来的真相，否则就是不通情理。

这需要训练，但任何人都可以呈现真相，而且真相通常会呈现出来。一旦呈现出来，它会发挥出其全部的效力。

布莱克的句子看起来和帕斯卡的句子很像。在风格上，威廉·布莱克的句子出人意料地有点复杂：真相不可能说出来能让人理解，不能让人相信。用平实风格表达这句话是「真相不可能说出来，也不可能让人相信」。

布莱克在平实风格的基础上做了进一步的提炼、限定和思考。他用简单的词句提炼出关键概念，让这种断言变得更加复杂巧妙，这是平实风格尽力规避的。这种言简意赅的概念提炼是典型的古典风格，所以布莱克的句子看起来很古典。

但布菜克不是古典风格。实际上布莱克的风格模棱两可。这个情况复杂且无法解决。经过考虑可以看出，布莱克的句子观点据摆不定，但由于作者和读者之间的交流通道不完整，所以读者甚至不能确定布莱克是否有意摇摆不定。表面上他呈现的是永恒可知的真相，不是偶然，也不限于特定场合，但如果我们仔细观察，他可能在表达完全不同的观点。他从未说真相有可能说出来，所以能被理解。这样的观点违背了古典风格的基础前提。这个基础前提在布莱克的句子中摇摆不定，依据一个可能实现也可能无法实现的前提。这个句子不是古典风格，不是因为它背离了古典风格的真相立场，而是因为它呈现的东西不是确定的。它在古典视角和非古典视角之间摇摆。这种形式的未决事物不可能是古典风格。

布莱克的句子就像一个内克尔立方体：它包含两种不同的图形，观察时我们一会儿看到这个图形，一会儿看到那个图形。它并非永恒。它不稳定。它不可能稳定下来。它看起来很古典，但这只是虚假的表象。

真相无须美化

选段 4-9

写作要自然、有力、精妙，就需要表现出真相。

—— 拉布吕耶尔，《品格论》2

事实是（国王）令人钦佩，并且肯定值得被历史学家载入史册，而不是被两位诗人歌颂。你和我一样清楚当我们谈到诗人时是指什么。无论怎样国王都不需要他们：不需要通过创造或虚构，将他推至别人之上；只需要一种纯粹的风格，干净而直接…...

—— 塞维涅夫人，《致堂兄布西 - 拉鲁廷的信》，1678 年 3 月 18 日 [13]

这两段互为补充的话引自法国古典风格的两位奠基人，表达了古典风格对待真相的典型立场，按照这种传统，这种立场比任何创造都更具有说服力，而且是人类才智未受蒙蔽时自然追求的目标。创造需要技巧。而真相自带说服力，无须复杂的修辞技巧或诗歌技巧。它只需要清晰地呈现。人类的才智可以自然地识别真相。技巧只会误导一这正是它的目的。这种误导会降低人类对真相的天然敏感度，从而削弱人类观察真相的天然能力。

因此，真相自然、有力、精妙。呈现真相的语言最好不要引起对自身的关注。当我们谈论某人的个人风格或文章风格时，我们通常指那些显眼的特征。当拉布吕耶尔谈论「自然地写作」时，他思考的是一种毫无特色的风格，就像「自然」不具有特色一样。从这个意义上，现代书在版式上比古抄本更自然，因为书打开后相互对称，正符合人体的对称结构。十二开的书最初是为了适合手拿而设计的，而现代书籍的版式是一种文本排布风格 —— 自然、有力、精妙，只有书目学家、图书装订员或档案管理员才可能意识到这是一种专为文本呈现而设计的版式。

古典风格就像一本书的版式，读者看得到，但它并不显眼。它适合呈现真相，就像一本书适合拿在手上。如果我们可以想象一台机器或一个外星人对人类身体一无所知，却要试图为人类读者设计一种文章呈现版式，我们就大概能理解为什么拉布吕耶尔认为作者没见到真相时应尽量自然、有力和精妙了。对人类读者而言，机械的设计或外星人的设计就不是自然、有力和精妙了，这好比让长着牡蛎身子的智慧生物拿一本十二开的图书一样。

塞维涅夫人是法国古典风格大家之一，接受过良好的文学教育。除法文外，她还懂拉丁文和意大利文，熟知许多写作风格。她喜欢塔索（Tasso）和阿里奥斯托（Ariosto）的寓言史诗，以及帕斯卡、拉罗什福科、莱兹和她的密友拉法耶特夫人的古典散文。但她认为诗歌无法表现一位名副其实的国王真正的品德，因为诗歌「美化」了真相。在十七世纪的法语用法中，pose（诗歌）的意思是「创造的故事」，而不是「真实的故事」，它最大的特点是虚假的修饰和出色的创造。她遗憾没有人记录路易十四的胜利，只有两位担任皇家史学家的诗人于 1678 年记录了路易十四当年攻下根特城，尽管一位是拉辛，另一位是博伊洛。塞维涅夫人并非反对使用思想和语言修辞形式 —— 隐喻、转喻、明喻、叙事、象征等不同的简化和具化形式 —— 这些通常是思想和语言必不可少的形式，在呈现古典风格真相时发挥着重要作用。她只是不赞成把它们当作点缀、装饰和技巧以「美化」真相。对塞维涅夫人来说，诗歌的修饰手法适合用来谈论史诗和传奇故事中的罗兰（Roland）或其他英雄人物，但当代现实只需要一种纯粹、干净、直白的风格。任何修饰只会分散人们观察真相的注意力，真相不需要帮助，只需要一个不受阻隔的视野。

让读者置身现场

首支盟军登陆法国的第三天，我在一艘大型步兵登陆艇（LCIL）的军官室里。登陆舰在法国巡洋舰蒙卡尔姆号的背风处飘荡着，邻近诺曼底海岸。登陆艇名号中的「大型」一词仅是相对而言。我所在的那间军官室长宽各七英尺，里面有两张双层床，一张四人桌。它可以容纳四名军官，但由于他们中总有一个人必须外出巡逻，军官室的四人桌可以留出一个空位给客人用，所以我刚好有位子坐。蒙卡尔姆号正在发射炮弹，每次发射都会使我们的船舰震动。发射目标是距离海岸线数英里的一个德军据点。房间里的收音机传来英国广播公司播音员张弛有度的声音：「本系列节目接下来报道的是前线的掩护炮火。」法国船再次发射炮弹，淹没了收音机的声音。我想播报的声音出自同一位播音员一我不确定，因为所有的英国广播公司的播音员的声音听起来都差不多一过了一会儿播音员又继续报道：「我们现在可以说本次登陆一举成功，令人喜出望外。空军和海军的大炮摧毁了沿海防御工事，陆军占领了它们。」美国海岸警卫队后备队的亨利·里格中尉，我们登陆艇的船长，看着他的工程官：朗（Log），两人开始笑起来。船上的通讯官员卡瓦诺说：「现在你对此有何看法？」我轻呼一声「上帝」。在登陆艇上，诺曼底登陆日在我们看来似乎不是那样。没有哪个伦敦广播室能给一个小伙子提供客观视角。

—— 李伯龄，《渡海战役》14

选段 4-10(1) 记录了 1944 年 6 月 6 日，李伯龄亲历的盟军入侵诺曼底事件，当时，他在一艘步兵登陆艇上。很容易看出这是古典风格。它的模式是对话，它的场合是非正式的，它的语气轻松、自信、没有防范，它采取的姿态是呈现而非论证的。它实际上有很多肯定的断言，有登陆日的真实情况、机构报道的性质，还有同质化播音员不可靠的广播，只遵照他们机构的纲领完全不符现场实况。但是，这些断言假装成呈现，好像任何人只要在这艘小船舰上都能看见的呈现。

文段还提到了一些读者想不到的意外信息：步兵登陆艇「大」到什么程度，船员数量和李伯龄在船上的容身方式。但没有无端展示与事件无关的晦涩军事知识。没有什么只有观察者自己看得到；没有什么必须依赖作者个人对证据的解释；一切都取决于读者能否处于作者所在的位置。

这件轶事是一位记者对新闻报道的对比反思，一方是没有根据的描述，一方是李伯龄的亲身经历。正如现场大炮的轰鸣淹没了收音机录制的大炮现场的声音，李伯龄和登陆艇军官在现场的经历淹没了伦敦广播公司播报的诺曼底入侵的新闻。这件铁事的说服力取决于作者身处的位置，所有细节都调集起来，让读者能够处于跟作者同样的位置，这样他可以自己看到作者讲述的事情。

和对话一样，这些句子彼此相继的顺序看起来很自然也非此不可，但这是一种非常高效的叙述。想一想，它可以说是完美的迷你结构。整个叙述是对李伯龄的新闻报道视角的形象化论证，作为对比抨击了英国广播公司的播报视角。这种形象化论证在它的内部还有一个迷你版一被现场实况吞没的英国广播公司录制的广播。这个选段描述的整体画面与大炮轰鸣的局部画面相互映衬，就像一个是宏观视角，一个是微观视角。两种画面都很有冲击力，读者自然能从如此形象的叙述中得出显而易见的结论。但整个选段听起来是即兴对话。作者在无形之中完成了所有工作，文章并没有引起读者关注文本本身或作者的思考过程。

古典风格的这种使用方式并不局限于现场报道。我们在「读者可以胜任」这部分讲到的多德的选段，也用了这种方式。它包含大量事实和学术体系，但它把它们呈现为偶然的信息，只要传达得足够清晰，那么读者会像多德一样得出必然结论。多德的文章和李伯龄的一样听起来像对话，自信且没有防范。文章能表现出这种自信，主要是因为作者引用事实和例证的方式十分清晰：各种事实及彼此的关联没有含混不清。各个部分之间的衔接非常连贯：作者完全知道他想要呈现的关系。

让读者自行判断

选段 4-10(2)

虽然我依据埃利奥特的书信和著作，记录了他经历的十六世纪三十年代至四十年代间的圣经复兴潮，但他身处的背景显然深受文化和历史潮流的冲击，这些潮流远远不限于教义、宗教习俗和区分新教和天主教的基督教主权，尽管这些问题已经加剧。埃利奥特自己也认识到，他的文学事业所面临的挑战，是涉及投身国王和克伦威尔的改革措施或者「圣经」的「品位」的问题。埃利奥特在追求成为一名世俗作家并避开宗教问题的过程中成功采取了大众化和世俗化措施，我认为这可以理解为跟随而非对抗更大意识形态运动势头的证据一首先，因为大众化和世俗化对于埃利奥特而言是真正的选择；其次，因为他有能力让它们发挥效用。以我们今日所知，即使伊丽莎白·爱森斯坦关于印刷机作为文化变革动因的研究对此有所促进，大部分时候我们不得不从征兆性和预测性视角处理系列迸发式发展一其中印刷术、人本主义以及宗教改革在社会和经济发展中占据突出地位 —— 这引领了图书的现代时代。

—— 贾娜尔·米勒，《母语和单词：1380-1580 年间英语散文风格的演变》15

贾娜尔·米勒这段写托马斯·埃利奥特爵士的话出自她的一本书，这本书讲的是中世纪晚期和文艺复兴时期英语散文的风格。这段话不是古典风格，主要不是因为一些局部的问题 —— 比如次要问题使文章结构含混不清 —— 而是因为它对场景、角色和主题的观念。它罗列了证据，但表现出一种断定和防范的态度，而没有做到不偏不倚。作者渴求认同又防范反对和攻击，好像场景和角色是对抗而非对话。如果作者把他要说的话说得越来越模糊，那是要服务于一个战略目的：最后不会得出一个清晰的说法，以防读者有所反应。这种风格最适合主张「胜利就是一切」的司法场景和角色；但它通常违背学术责任。米勒描述的混乱场景有一种明显的紧张感，导致形式上相互冲突，学术证据本身含糊，彼此的关联牵强，有时根本没关联：「以我们今日所知一即使伊丽莎白·爱森斯坦关于印刷机作为文化变革动因的研究对此有所促进…」随机提到一些毫不相关的学术问题，看似博学，但缺乏学术论证。

李伯龄写的是你可以看到可以听到的东西，多德写的是文本编辑和历史解读这些最抽象的东西，两位作家都写得很清晰，好像他们呈现的主题独立于作者和文章而存在。而米勒写的主题好像依附于她本人而存在，这包括埃利奥特经历的「十六世纪三十年代至四十年代间的圣经复兴潮」，「他身处的背景」，「冲击」该背景的「文化历史潮流」的性质。「他身处的背景显然深受文化和历史潮流的冲击，这些潮流远远不限于教义、宗教习俗和区分新教和天主教的基督教主权，尽管这些问题已经加剧」。这段话的「显然」一词显得不可信的原因可能就在这里。真的很显然吗？对谁而言？对任何读过埃利奥特的「书信和著作」的人来说很显然吗？对埃利奥特自己很显然吗？明显不是。因为作者似乎不同意埃利奥特的说法。她说，他所做的一切应该以某种方式解释，即「跟随而非对抗更大意识形态运动势头的证据」。它应该这样被解释，她不断重复道，因为那正是他做的事情。她所提供的「证据」，依附于她的「视角」而「呈现」，作者提供的证据赋予这个特定视角说服力，但描述它的方式无法使读者站在她的视角看问题。只有基于那个视角才能得出结论，而且如此模糊，让人无从质疑。

虽然这段写埃利奥特的话表面上呈现了证据，但这些证据完全依附于作者的倾向。这种风格的作者可通过巧妙的处理，避免被质疑这类证据是否可靠，但这种情况下，要在本身既无形又不确定的抽象事物之间建立准确的联系，会有一种明显的紧张感，所以整个段落自然会透露出一种焦虑，甚至作者自己都不清楚她要讲的主题。她必须自我确认，她讲的都是真的，都很重要，她的理解合情合理且意义重大，读者会感兴趣。她的焦虑会传达给读者也不足为怪。

这类问题不常出现在数学领域，尽管数学主题一般都是抽象事物间的确切关系。这些事物虽然抽象，但它们与步兵登陆艇一样明显，而且这种关系的论据很明确，每个人都可以知道，不像「更大意识形态运动的势头」这种不明所以的方向。这种意识形态运动的边界，不像等腰三角形的边界一或步兵登陆艇军官室的大小一那样清晰可辨。这段对世俗作家托马斯·埃利奥特爵士的生涯的描述传达的明显紧张感，源于思想上的紧张：抽象事物本身不确定，却要为之构建关系并形成概念，还要呈现得跟平方根或大型步兵登陆艇军官的编制人数一样准确和可验证。而多德已经充分且准确地思考了他希望呈现的关系和抽象事物，所以写出来就像李伯龄写一艘船在另一艘船的背风处飘荡一样。古典风格非常适合呈现抽象事物，但古典风格作者要在仔细思考抽象事物的特征和边界后，才能自信地展现它们，不需要防范、歪曲或模糊，这些只会削弱读者自行判断作者的结论的能力。







思想和语言

晦涩主题清晰表达

选段 4-11

文艺复兴时期，在战争中使用火炮是重要的首创，但直到一段时间后才完全发挥出它的效果。查理八世正是靠它攻下米兰、佛罗伦萨、罗马和那不勒斯。按照阿里奥斯托的叫法，这个「恶魔的发明」（在他之后拉伯雷也对此进行过抨击），直接结束了传统的战争模式，也结束了身着盔甲的骑士意气风发的战斗。最终，这让为战争而生的贵族阶级毫无价值一直到在意大利及其他地区经历了 40 年的艰苦战争，被战争再次教育之后，贵族们才找到用武之地。大炮的使用范围扩大后，城镇的内外防御工事也开始彻底改革，该领域最出色的专家弗朗切斯科·迪·乔其奥和朱利亚诺·达·桑加洛，发明了一套螺纹套绳和较接式堡垒组合系统，彻底改变了城墙的朝向乃至整个设防城市的格局。最了不起的规划是那些米开朗琪罗为保卫佛罗伦萨（1529-1530 年）所做的规划，凯萨·波吉耳还以工程师的身份请过列奥纳多·达·芬奇。战争艺术的演变多大程度上影响了文艺复兴还有待充分评估。

—— 安德烈·夏斯岱尔，《1420-1520 年间的文艺复兴神话》16

这段话讲的是十六世纪在战争中引入火炮及由此带来的影响，除了社会影响，还有对「传统战争模式」等高度抽象事物的影响以及对城墙和防御工事等有形事物的影响一这些影响可能被别人写成「受系列军事发展冲击的文化和社会潮流方向」 —— 但选段只有开头的简短观点和结尾的一点补充。中间部分都是对开头观点的展开说明，同时援引了事件和例证，为最后的结论作铺垫。虽然这段仅两百词的话谈到了八位人物、四座城市，还提及具体的防御工事、新防御工事计划和在两个地方（一处有明确地点，另一处没有）持续四十年的战争，除了引用的戏称和随后括号中的题外话，提及的每个元素都在合适的位置上。没有哪一个让人感觉突兀或者随意。这种博学看起来并非毫无根据，也没有紧张感；没有模糊段落的组织结构，也没有阻碍行文的自然流动。主题复杂晦涩不代表呈现必须复杂晦涩。

选段 4-12

论句子说，加朗的版本是所有版本里最差、最荒谬、最愚蠢的一种，不过却是阅读量最大的一种。谁与它比较接近，谁就了解它这种幸运和意外。加朗那现在看来很浅薄的东方学曾经使众多吸鼻烟的人目瞪口呆，并且使他们造成了一场五幕悲剧。十二本精制的卷帙在一九O七年至一九一七年之间出现，十二卷书被无数人阅读，并被翻译成好几种语言，其中包括印度斯坦语和阿拉伯语。我们这些二十世纪不合时宜的单纯读者在书里闻到了十八世纪的甜蜜味道，而不是早在两百年前就为东方确定了其苹新和光荣的矜持芳香。对于这种脱节，任何人都没有责任，特别是加朗更没有责任。

—— 豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯，《「一千零一夜」的译者》① 17

① 汉译文出自《永恒史》刘京胜和屠孟超合译版本。—— 译者注

一千零一夜的故事也许不可言传。这些故事的文化起源 —— 印度文化、波斯文化及阿拉伯文化 —— 可能无法追溯。原作的手稿传统是一场噩梦，相比之下，传说中马洛的《浮士德博士》文本问题显得微不足道。这部作品的构成部分 —— 哪些故事属于它，或者至少哪些故事属于它的哪一个版本，以及故事出现的先后顺序 —— 基本上无法确定。它在十八世纪传遍整个欧洲时，出现了一系列著名译本，这些译本的历史往好说是复杂而微妙的，往坏说是无从知晓的。

任何一位作者，如果因为怀疑自己的写作能力导致风格受影响，面对这些知识障碍时就很难写下去。作者自身的文化处境和个人处境也可能导致其他障碍。豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯是二十世纪拉丁美洲优秀的古典风格作家，是图书管理员，是著名的博学之士，是男性。相此之下，「一千零一夜」发源的传统，不属于精英，不属于特权人士，不属于博学之士，不属于二十世纪，不属于白种人，不属于欧洲或拉丁美洲地区，也不属于男性：它的传播，也许还有故事的创作，很大程度上掌握在女性手中。它们在它们自己的时代已是公认的颠覆性故事，无论在我们这个年代，还是在它们自己的年代，都属主动背离政治正确：它们抨击当时的主流观念把意识形态工程当作对复杂的人类事务的有效回应。十八、十九世纪的英国人和法国人把这些故事传到了欧洲。

尽管博尔赫斯要面对这重重困难，而且在文化背景和个人经历上与这些故事的起源及它们的译者相差甚远，仍然写出了古典风格的姿态。他呈现的是普遍被知道的真相。原则上，任何人都可以验证这些真相，不管他是什么文化身份。他认为他的主题独立于作者存在，呈现上也是如此。他把它呈现给有能力的读者，从不会让文本本身成为写作主题。作者和读者之间是一种对等关系：就像多德在考虑《约翰福音》的文本历史时一样，博尔赫斯认为，原则上任何人都可以了解他了解过的，继而看到他所看到的。虽然博尔赫斯讲的是高度抽象的概念一东方学、版本质量、文本阅读量、幸运、十八世纪的味道、革新与光荣、责任和极其复杂的文化模式 —— 但他认为它们清晰准确。它们就像切割的水晶一样轮廓分明、清晰可见。没有哪个概念依附于作者本人而存在。

任何东西都能用古典风格呈现，包括作者和读者的文化历史处境，只要这些是主题的一部分。博尔赫斯把呈现作为二十世纪读者的我们的处境当作呈现这些翻译及其历史真相的一部分。但这些问题不会取代选定的主题，也不会干预主题的呈现。虽然古典风格作者的写作主题可能因为文化、历史和个人处境的阻碍无法或者很难写下去，他实际写的时候绝不会表现出任何表达上的困难。他会用简单明了、通俗易懂、确凿无疑的语言去呈现文章不可能写得简单明了、通俗易懂、确凿无疑这个真相。他会以一种读者会像他一样认识真相的姿态来表达读者不可能像他一样认识任何事物这个真相。

抽象主题准确表达

选段 4-13

图赖讷地区是法国的中心地带。和其他任何一个地区一样，正是在这里，发展了现代法国精妙、利落而细致的语言，恰恰也是在这里，发展了现代法国精妙、精细、专业的烹饪。

—— 威弗利·鲁特，《法国美食》18

人发现的可能是无意寻求的东西一事实上，每个鉴赏家都能切身体会到，人发现的东西几乎都不是他所寻求的。如果你去寻找草莓，你知道草莓长什么样子一但你去寻找事物之间的联系时，你不知道是什么样的联系。这种始终存在的危险恰恰在于，寻找某个东西的欲望和意愿会在寻求者心中预先投射一种关联种不存在的关联。

—— 马克斯·J. 弗里德伦德尔，《早期尼德兰绘画》19

绘画与文学之间不存在完美的结构对应，事实上这并不妨碍、更不能严格限制人们比较不同的艺术。相反，它鼓励人们寻找绘画者与写作者建立的一组不断变化的关系，他们可以自由强调各自艺术不同的结构元素，从而找到二者的对应关系。因此，艺术之间的相通不在于艺术本身固有的结枸：而在于探索这两种结构如何彼此契合。这种契合属于符号现象整体中必不可少的同形特征和同义特征（homonymity and synonymity）的一部分，这些特征使得符号系统和它们的文本彼此接近又相互背离。

—— 温迪·史坦纳，《修辞的颜色：现代文学与绘画关系存在的问题》20

鲁特和弗里德伦德尔的这两个选段是古典风格；史坦纳的选段不是。这种差异与他们论述的主题的性质无关，但与这些主题构思的方式有关。鲁特和弗里德伦德尔以一种清晰准确的方式论述他们的主题，使它们看起来完全独立于作者。而史坦纳论述主题的方式，好像主题因她而存在，因为她才能表达出来。

鲁特写的是食物与语言，而弗里德伦德尔写的是事物之间的关系：食物可以通过感官体验，而事物之间的关系可以通过抽象思维体验，二者都能用语言匹配，说明古典风格与主题的性质无关。鲁特谈的是有悖常理的事情，而弗里德伦德尔说的是我们都可以证实的事情，说明古典风格与其所谈内容的真假无关。

鲁特的句子是一种轻松自信的古典风格对话。即使错了，也丝毫没有削弱古典风格的立场。所谓图赖讷地区说的是原始的「纯正」法语，这种谬传经久不衰但一直面临各种矛盾 —— 图尔市的商店招牌上写着「Le Fast-Foud」（快餐）—— 任何声称现代法国美食起源于图赖讷的说法都会激怒一些地区的人，大概从桑斯算起直到里昂最南边。美食的特点与语言的特点存在某种关系 —— 当然，鲁特此处说的语言特点是某种风格的特点，而不是某种语言的特点 —— 这种说法必定无法让人信服。虽然许多大厨做的菜精妙、利落而细致，但他们说话的风格跟帕斯卡和塞维涅夫人相距甚远。其实鲁特并没有严肃地声明美食和语言之间存在必然联系。他虽未明言但断定美食 —— 跟文学风格一样 —— 是一种文化的重要标志。

语言和美食，即使仅限定在当代法国的语言和美食，仍是一个很大而且不确定的话题，但这里把它放入一个根深蒂固的本体论隐喻之中，看作与弗里德伦德尔笔下描绘的草莓差不多一样的「事物」。弗里德伦德尔是柏林凯撒·弗里德里希博物馆的第三任馆长，喜欢先用基础证据引入 —— 实际的绘画 —— 然后将抽象的东西归入这个模式中，将它们当作「事物」，呈现得如此清晰准确，让人几乎忘记它们是抽象事物。他以一贯辛辣的口吻指出，理论家如果不能清楚仔细地区别抽象事物本身和他讲述它们的方式，教出来的学生会和他们的老师一样，始终只能看到他们想看的东西；而像他那样的鉴赏家讲述抽象事物从概念上独立于他们的讲述方式，虽预想的是某个特定时间特定地方的画，但实际遇到的常常是意料之外的画。

史坦纳的写作是那种越写到后面越让人疑惑的类型。她的段落越写到后面，越偏向推测，也越不可能找出查验弗里德伦德尔所说的那种共同证据来验证特定的文本和绘画。而古典风格作者，无论他的主题多么抽象，都会非常明确地呈现出来，完全独立于作者，以至于我们所有人都会把它当作「事物」，也就是说，我们任何一个人都可以看到它的证据，只要我们处在合适的位置。相反，史坦纳的主题飘忽不定，依赖她本人存在，缺乏她与她的读者都能看到的对等证据，这些特征在她的文章中被认为是作者才识过人，而非作者无法胜任。最后呈现的这组包含文学和绘画的「结构」的抽象关系 ——「符号系统和它们的文本」和「符号现象整体中必不可少的同形特征和同义特征」—— 完全脱离了古典风格，暗示史坦纳的才能至少有某些神谕成分。鲁特的文章容易被攻击，正是因为他呈现的事物准确，且容易被我们自己验证，任何有幸同时学过法语和法国菜的人都可以质疑他。史坦纳把她的推测包裹在带行话色彩的修辞外衣中，暗示她知道别人不知道的事情，因此避免了像鲁特那样暴露自己的弱点，但是冒着自称有超自然的视野和洞察力的风险。她暗示她传达的是一般人看不到的奥秘，所谓的奥秘不过是绘画和文学虽不是各个方面相似但也能相互比较，大体了解主题后也不难得出结论：绘画和文学有相似也有不同。
