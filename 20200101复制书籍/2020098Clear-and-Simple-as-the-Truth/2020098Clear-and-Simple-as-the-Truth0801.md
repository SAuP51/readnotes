### Fundamentals: Write Second

If you have completed the common exercises in speech, you are probably ready to do them in writing. If you are wondering why there has been such a lengthy oral preliminary to the acquisition of a style of writing, our answer can be found in the opening paragraphs of this book. Writing is an intellectual activity. To achieve good prose styles, writers must work through intellectual issues, not merely acquire mechanical techniques. The heart of classic style is the root scene of classic joint attention. The actual scene of writing is blended with the classic scene so that writing is treated as speech. No matter how many people are addressed, no matter how indeterminate this「audience」is, no matter where they are, the style treats them as if they were a single person to whom the writer is speaking. Inferences, judgments, predictions, and cultural knowledge are treated as「things」that can be directly perceived. Neither the concept of classic joint attention nor an ability to blend an actual scene with the classic scene can be acquired simply by writing and then doing some local revision. Blending complex networks to the classic scene defines classic style, and while it is possible to acquire this ability through imitation of classic models, it is a chancy and inefficient path. In the Studio, we are offering a tested and secure path. If you work out the intellectual issues first, the activity of writing will be defined by a concept of style. You can then proceed with confidence.

You have already practiced the common exercises in speech. Now is the moment to observe that what works in speech cannot be directly transfered to writing. Go through the common exercises anew, this time in writing. We are not asking you to transcribe what you have already said, offering it in written form. Approach the exercises now with the resources of writing; do not cling to the resources of speech. Anchoring writing in speech is not pretending that writing is speech. Anchoring a mental network supporting expression in the classic scene is not pretending that you are in an actual classic scene; it is more subtle. It may sound paradoxical to say both that having done the speech exercises will help you to master a style of writing and that writing is a very different activity from speech because it lacks the resources of speech. But both are true and for a crucial reason: classic prose style blends speech with writing. A classic prose stylist must be able to supply by imaginative blending the structure of classic joint attention that the actual environment of writing lacks.

In what follows, we will add some comments on doing these common exercises in writing.

TUTORIAL: Blending Scenes

Writing is not a scene of classic joint attention, but in classic style the writer will use the classic scene as an anchor so that, in the blend, writing becomes speaking, the indefinite audience that is not present becomes a single person who is right there, and the subject becomes something that can be perceived. If writing is not a scene of classic joint attention, neither is reading — and writing, especially in classic style, assumes a reader, so it is part of the writer's task to induce the reader to anchor her activity in the classic scene as well.

Neither writer nor reader is deluded. They both know they do not share an environment they can refer to directly, but the writer anchors the actual scene to the classic scene in order to provide a consistent style.

TUTORIAL: Lost in Words

In writing, you lose the effects of the charm you may have in person. You lose the effects of gesture, proximity, warmth, intonation. In person, you can command and hold attention by being attractive, but all of that is gone in writing. All you have is the appeal of the presentation — the attraction of thought and of language. A speaker of some personal charm can give a pastiche of clichés the illusion of meaning, but in writing, a pastiche of clichés will always look like a pastiche of clichés. Presence is crucial to the classic scene. But in classic writing, there is no speaker, no shared environment, no interaction between speaker and listener. Presence must be supplied by the writing itself. Bernard Shaw, a dramatist who wrote his plays to be read, was especially sensitive to this distinction. He once remarked that there are fifty ways of saying the word「yes,」and five hundred ways of saying the word「no,」but just one way of writing them down.

TUTORIAL: Onset and Dismount

A written text has a beginning and an end — a first sentence and a last. Sections of writing have beginnings and ends too. Typically, speaking is not so discrete. When you drop into classic style in speaking, there may have been quite a bit of speech before it — greetings, small talk, and obligatory ceremonial questions and answers — and always after it the dribbling little bits of farewell, which the Viennese used to call「Goodbye without leaving.」Your first words are unlikely to be taken as the start of a coherent presentation. In classic prose, it is automatic. The first sentence is the onset. The last sentence, at least of the section, is the dismount. Crisp onset and dismount carry a premium in classic writing beyond their value in classic speech.

0801 写作基础练习：写为其次

如果你已经完成口头形式的通用练习，你可能准备好开始书面形式的练习了。如果你想知道为什么学习一种写作风格之前，需要做这么长时间的口头预备练习，答案可以在本书的开头几段找到。写作是一种脑力活动。要写出不错的风格，作者需解决思想问题，而不仅仅是学习机械的写作技巧。古典风格的核心是古典联合注意这一基础场景。写作的实际场景与古典场景融合在一起，所以可以把写作看作说话。无论要面向多少人，无论这些「读者」多么不确定，无论他们身在何处，古典风格都把他们当作与作者对话的一个个体。推测、判断、预测和文化知识被视为可以直接观察的「事物」。无论古典联合注意的概念，还是将实际场景与古典场景融合的能力，都无法通过单纯的写作和一些局部修改掌握。将复杂的网络融合到古典场景确立了古典风格，虽然模仿古典风格范例有可能获得这种能力，但这种方法不可靠而且低效。在工作室，我们提供了一种经过验证的可靠方法。如果你先解决思想问题，写作活动只是一种风格概念问题，然后就可以自信地写了。

你已经完成了口头形式的通用练习。现在是时候注意，适用说话的不一定直接适用写作。重新做一遍通用练习，这次写出来。我们不是让你把之前说过的话转录成书面形式，而是要用书面表达资源来做这些练习，不要依赖口头表达资源。将写作锚定到说话场景，不是假装写作就是说话。将支持表达的思想网络锚定到古典场景，不是假装你就在一个真实的古典场景中，实际情况要比这微妙得多。一方面，做这些口头表达练习将帮助你掌握一种写作风格；另一方面，写作因为缺乏口头表达资源与说话大不相同，这两种说法似乎相矛盾，但两者都能成立，且基于一个重要原因：古典文章的风格将说话与写作融于一体。一位古典风格作者肯定会借助想象力融合古典联合注意的结构，补足实际写作环境欠缺的东西。

接下来做书面形式的通用练习，我们会增加一些评论。

练习指导：融合场景

写作不是一种古典联合注意场景，但是在古典风格中，作者把古典场景用作风格之锚，所以锚定融合之后，写作变成了讲话，不在场的不确定观众变成了正在现场的个人，主题变成可以被观察的事物。如果说写作不是古典联合注意场景，那么阅读也不是一写作，尤其是古典风格的写作，会假想一个读者，因此作者的任务之一就是引导读者将他自己的活动也锚定在古典场景中。

作者和读者都不会上当。双方都知道他们并没有处在同一个可直接参照的环境中，但作者将实际场景锚定到古典场景可以保持风格一致。

练习指导：文字中的缺失

面对面交流的魅力，一旦用文字表达出来，就会消失殆尽。你无法表现手势、亲近、热情和语调。面对面时，你可以依靠个人魅力吸引和保持对方的注意力，但写作无法发挥这样的效果。你唯一可以发挥的就是呈现的魅力 —— 语言和思想的魅力。一位魅力无穷的人，即使重复陈词溢调，也会让它们听起来有意义，但在写作上，陈词溢调看起来永远都是陈词滥调。现场感对古典场景至关重要。但古典风格的写作，没有人说话，没有共同的环境，没有说者与听者的互动。写作本身需创造一种现场感。剧作家萧伯纳写剧本要能读出来，对这种细微差别特别敏感。他曾说过，有五十种方式说「是」这个词，有五百种方式说「不」这个词，但两个词都只有一种写法。

练习指导：开头和结尾

文章都有开头和结尾 —— 有第一句话，就有最后一句话。文章的章节也有开头和结尾。通常，说话不是东拉西扯，说话时，进入古典风格之前要说很多话 —— 问候、闲聊和必要的礼节性问答 —— 结束时又总会断断续续地说些零零碎碎的告别语，维也纳人曾经称为「告而不别」（Goodbye without leaving）。你开头的话不可能作为一个连贯呈现的开始。在古典文章中，默认第一句话就是开始。最后一句话，至少章节的最后一句话，代表着结束。干净利落的开始和结束对古典写作很重要，并且远超过它在古典讲话中的价值。
