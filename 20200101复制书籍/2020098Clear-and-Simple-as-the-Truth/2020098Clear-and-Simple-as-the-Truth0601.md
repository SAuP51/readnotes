When that was once begun, it was as little in my fear, that what words of complaint I heard among lerned men of other parts utter'd against the Inquisition, the same I should hear by as lerned men at home utterd in time of Parlament against an order of licencing; and that so generally, that when I had disclos'd my self a companion of their discontent, I might say, if without envy, that he whom an honest quæstorship had indear'd to the Sicilians, was not more by them importun'd against Verres, then the favourable opinion which I had among many who honour ye, and are known and respected by ye, loaded me with entreaties and perswasions; that I would not despair to lay together that which just reason should bring into my mind, toward the removal of an undeserved thraldom upon lerning.

— John Milton, Areopagitica

This passage, a single sentence of 142 words, is almost impossible to understand at one reading. Although it comes from an essay ostensibly meant to be a speech to Parliament, it does not model itself on speech and distances itself self-consciously from any possible model of conversation. It has no image schema indicating a clear direction or a goal. It is in every way unclassic and offers a striking contrast to the most conspicuous style of French prose contemporary with it.

It would be tempting for any contemporary writing consultant to offer a sort of over-the-counter prescription for improving this sentence if it were not for the fact that it occurs in a major seventeenth-century prose text that has been studied and admired around the world for over three centuries. Such a writing consultant would place a premium on clarity and would suggest effective means of rewriting the entire Areopagitica so as to make it easier to parse. But Milton would have viewed these revisions as a complete destruction of his mature and accomplished style, and he would have been right.

Clarity is a prime virtue within classic style or practical style, and it is easy to begin judging other styles by the standards of one of these general styles, especially for writers who actually use one of them on a regular basis. Classic style, like practical style, encourages such judgments by making a tacit claim to being a universal style. But this claim is deceptive. Neither classic style nor practical style can suit Milton's purposes because his model scene is not the scene essential to either classic or practical style. In this way, this passage resembles Samuel Johnson's opening comments in his「Preface to Shakespeare」: both Milton and Johnson write in mature and consistent styles completely incompatible with either classic or practical style. The model scene behind classic style is conversation, with the result that it tends to come in discrete units, intelligible when excerpted. The model scene behind the Areopagitica requires a display of ostentatiously orchestrated erudition. This scene places the highest premium on gravity and allusion — not on clarity. Far from depending on a model of conversation, it is not even modeled on English speech; it is modeled on written Latin. The influence of Milton's model scene upon his style is such that an excerpted passage may be nearly unintelligible, but there is no reason for Milton to view this as a fault. He does not mean the Areopagitica to live through pithy excerpts, and he most certainly would suffer from using a style that looks as if it is easy to parse or conveniently packaged into easily digested bites. To rewrite the Areopagitica in the style of La Rochefoucauld or A. J. Liebling would be to ensure that the reader Milton is addressing would immediately brand it as trivial.

Socrates in the Apology expresses a touchstone of classic style, as if it were a fundamental priority of all style:「If you hear me defending myself in the same language which it has been my habit to use, both in the open spaces of this city (where many of you have heard me) and elsewhere, do not be surprised.」

He explicitly refuses to adopt the mannered style of the courtroom, and he implies that there is something artificial and dishonest in that style. He adopts as his model scene conversation, voice, spontaneity. As a result, it is easy to excerpt from his speech discrete, intelligible units of discourse. The Apology is, after all, with a very minimum of glossing, perfectly intelligible today in translation to audiences in Oregon or Ohio or Hong Kong, audiences who know absolutely nothing about the conventions of Athenian courtrooms at the beginning of the fourth century B.c.

By contrast, imagine a speech by an Athenian orator whose main goal, unlike Socrates', is to win his case. Contemporary readers in Hong Kong or Ohio cannot, of course, imagine any such thing in detail. The specific good moves in such a speech would go unnoticed or function as barriers to understanding in much the fashion that Milton's elaborate syntax and classical allusions do in the passage from the Areopagitica. It would be impossible to「correct」Milton's style (or the Athenian orator's) without understanding the scene that helps define his style as well as he does. Only a few specialists in seventeenth-century English parliamentary history have any such knowledge today, and it is not obvious that any of them now knows how to address the Parliament that Milton wished to address as well as Milton did himself. No general principle (「Omit needless words,」for example) can ever supersede a specific knowledge of such elements of style as the scene and cast that help define a style, for only they can indicate which words are needless.

While I've indicated to you previously that we may well have, probably do have, enough monetary stimulus in the system to create that [economic recovery], I'm not sure that we will not need some insurance or to revisit this issue, and all I can say to you is that we're all looking at the same set of data, the same economy, the same sense of confidence which pervades it. We're all making our judgments with respect to how that is evolving with respect to economic activity and where the risks of various different actions are. And there will be differences inevitably.

— Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, responding to senators at a congressional hearing, who were trying to get him to cut interest rates in order to speed economic recovery (March 1992)

This passage from Alan Greenspan, as reported by The New York Times of 20 April 1992, is certainly not an example of classic style, but it is a definite style and a cultivated one. Since it is above all a spoken style (meant, however, to be read in newspaper accounts), Mr. Greenspan refers to it as「an incoherent mumble.」Its virtues are just the opposite of classic style's virtues, and performances in this style should not be confused with the speaker's general level of articulateness. It is not a style of obfuscation as it is sometimes claimed to be, for its speaker is not hiding a conclusion or a point that he actually expresses buried in all that confusing verbiage. It is rather a style of gridlock, expressed in a manner that is built around images of contradictory and asymmetrical motion and a shifting kaleidoscope of qualifications. It is not, like classic style, a general style; it is a special style deliberately deployed by the relatively few people in positions like that of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, whose powers are vast and whose words are carefully studied for hints of what they are likely to do. If the passage is pored over carefully, it gives no hint about whether Greenspan will or will not lower interest rates, whether he has made up his mind on the subject, or even whether he agrees that lowering interest rates will have the effect that the senators think it will have.

For powerful directors of policy forced to testify in public, the virtues of classic style can be disastrous. The protocol of congressional hearings requires that the respondents appear to respect the committee, so people like Alan Greenspan cannot say,「I'm here because I have to be here, but I'm not telling you anything.」The unusual circumstances of this scene require the successful practitioner to give the impression that he or she actually may have said something of substance, and to avoid at all costs inviting any further clarifying questions of an obvious sort. If Greenspan had said,「I think we've already lowered interest rates enough, but we are monitoring the situation continually and it may be that at some point it will make sense to lower them further. I will do what I think is indicated at the appropriate time, and that may not be what you think is indicated,」he would have made his essential points much more clearly, but at an unacceptable cost. It is unwise for him to indicate to the senators in a clear fashion that he will do what he thinks best and will be unaffected by anything they think, nor does he wish clearly to rule out what they suggest since it is against his interests to indicate either that he will or will not lower the interest rates and equally against his interests to give any indication about when he will make up his mind. The hypothetical revision is clearer certainly, but it invites unwelcome questions: Then you have ruled out, for the moment, lowering interest rates? Under what future circumstances will it make sense to lower the rates further? What are you watching as an indicator that the current rates are too high?

All of these questions must be warded off because he really does not wish to give any indication of his future course of action. Various markets would react to any hint he may give of what he is likely to do. In the circumstances,「While I've indicated to you previously that we may well have, probably do have, enough monetary stimulus in the system to create that . . .」is in every way superior to「I think we've already lowered interest rates enough.」The statement is so filled with qualifications and so indefinite even with respect to its effective date or what it is talking about that it says absolutely nothing about what he may do while seeming to offer a concession.「While I said x at some point in the past,」leads the audience to expect「I say y now.」That is not the actual sequence, and what does follow is so much at odds with what is expected, and so entirely shapeless, that it is not immediately clear that there is actually no concession. Everything is done to leave doubt on later analysis even that he still thinks enough has been done now「to create that」(create what? the exasperated reader says), since the whole phrase is framed by「I've indicated to you previously,」and does not offer the expected symmetrical statement about what the speaker is indicating now. Greenspan uses subtle verbal resources to avoid the unhedged present indicative and to erase any momentary appearance of stable assertion: modals, ambiguous reference, adverbs of doubt, locations of events in an indefinite future or an indefinite ongoing present.

This passage and a consideration of the special requirements of its exceptional scene can serve as a reminder first, that what is a vice in one style can be a virtue in another and second, that there are not merely two styles, good and bad, but many styles, some general, some highly specialized. Almost any English composition teacher would say that this passage「needs revision,」and may go on to suggest what is wrong with it. In fact, there is nothing wrong with it. It is a virtuoso performance of stonewalling disguised as incoherence. There is nothing sloppy about it. It is not unplanned. It is deliberate in its contradiction of the expected symmetrical and directional image schema whose expectations it frustrates with exquisite skill. It is a performance as precise as a cat's walking though a chaos of objects on a messy desk without disturbing any of them.

This memorandum . . . deals with what might be called the least important questions confronting authors and publishers. But it is precisely because of their relative unimportance, despite their capacity for mischief-making, that we should be able to take them in our stride. The effort, in other words, is to remove them from the problem category so that we can devote our energy to matters of larger significance — authors and editors to intelligent and imaginative control of fact and expression, designers and compositors to efficient and artistic typesetting, proofreaders to rapid and precise detection of inaccuracies.

Although there are some matters of comma style (for instance, restrictive vs. nonrestrictive clauses) so well established in custom as to have become rules, nearly all are merely matters of taste. We prefer a comma before the conjunction in a series (「red, white, and blue」), and also after「i.e.」and「e.g.」

— 「Memorandum for Authors, Editors, Compositors, Proofreaders on the Preparation of Manuscripts and the Handling of Proof,」Princeton University Press, January 1990

English orthography satisfies all the requirements of the canons of reputability under the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic, cumbrous, and ineffective; its acquisition consumes much time and effort; failure to acquire it is easy of detection.

— Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class

The attitude of the memorandum from Princeton University Press might come as a surprise to readers of the guides and handbooks used in English composition courses, where questions of capitalization, spelling, punctuation, and usage seem to constitute not just the most conspicuous surface aspects of writing but practically the whole subject. The reason for this common misordering of priorities is precisely the conspicuous nature of these accidentals. That is why Thorstein Veblen suggested in a classic work of sociology that spelling is meant to indicate a form of social distinction based on the leisure to learn an arbitrary and inefficient system. Such things as the pronunciation and spelling of place names often serve as a marker distinguishing the local population from outsiders. A distinguished American theologian who pulled off a highway to ask directions to Beloit, which he pronounced in the French manner (bell-wah), was quickly informed, once the laughter died down,「Beh-LOIT, buddy. You're in Wisconsin now.」

Accidentals hardly enter into the elements of style at all, but they can cause any amount of mischief unless they are well managed because they indicate the writer's knowledge of etiquette and protocol. The idea that dictionaries and handbooks control these questions is a common misunderstanding. Dictionaries and handbooks try as hard as they can to keep up with the practice of a vaguely defined set of speakers who together determine prevailing limits of taste in such matters. Dictionary editors are in the same position as individuals who do not wish to be conspicuous in the wrong way. But unlike many of these individuals, the editors understand that they are observing a contest in social influence, not recording — much less defining — a correct position.

In Lulu in Hollywood, Louise Brooks, who must be the best writer among all the sex symbols of the silent screen, explains that she became painfully aware of her Kansas accent because it made her sound provincial in New York. She encountered a Columbia University student at the soda fountain of a drugstore she frequented and flattered him into becoming her speech teacher. In her own words,

「Mulk」became「milk,」and「kee-yow」became「cow.」Then:「Not ‘watter' as in ‘hotter' but ‘water' as in ‘daughter.' And it's not ‘hep,' you hayseed — it's ‘help,' ‘help,' ‘help'!」Within a month of fudge sundaes, this boy had picked his way through my vocabulary, eliminating the last trace of my hated Kansas accent. From the start, it had been my intention not to exchange one label for another. I didn't want to speak the affected London stage-English of the high-comedy stars, like Ina Claire and ruth chatterton; I wanted to speak clean, unlabeled English. My soda jerk spoke clean, unlabeled English.

Louise Brooks was no doubt right to think that in New York in the 1920s a femme fatale could not go around saying「kee-yow」instead of「cow,」but consider how wrong she is to think that she had acquired「unlabeled」English. She had merely dropped an unfashionable label for one that was more suitable to the image she sought to project. Even if we leave her native Kansas out of the question, how would her New York soda jerk's「clean, unlabeled English」sound in Baton Rouge, Louisiana? Fort Worth, Texas? Chicago, Illinois? Or even across the bridge in Brooklyn?

The same social principle applies to many conspicuous aspects of language, none of which determines style. Consider the disappearance of the word「Negro」from contemporary American usage and the currently tenuous position of its successor,「black.」At what point was「Negro」archaic usage and who decided the question? Certainly not American dictionaries. They merely surveyed current usage until they determined that the change had become general. The same phenomenon is going on today with the term「black,」which itself may soon become archaic in general usage to be replaced by either「Afro-American」or「African American.」The competition between these two terms will be decided by how quickly one of them is generally adopted.

All such competitions induce anxiety in many writers and speakers because the「wrong」choice can make a speaker or writer look ridiculous. For this reason there is always a market for self-proclaimed language gurus, and every bookstore has a shelf of etiquette books that pretend all these questions are settled, although inevitably these books often disagree with one another. Publishers and their technical staffs are under no illusions; they know there is no authority outside of the social hierarchy of native speakers and writers. They also know that while accidentals can cause mischief, no degree of mere correctness can possibly constitute a style and too much anxiety about accidentals can compromise one. There were plenty of actresses in the 1920s who never had to substitute「cow」for「kee-yow,」but none of them projected the image that Louise Brooks did. She would have ruined that image, moreover, had she betrayed anxiety about getting it right.

Misunderstandings on this subject sometimes extend to people who have exceptional power to influence usage. The New York Times and The Washington Post gave coverage to Thurgood Marshall's decision to use the term「Afro-American」in a written opinion he filed in 1989 as an associate justice of the United States Supreme court.

First the eminent jurist explained his motives:「I spent most of my life fighting to get Negro spelled with a capital N. . . . Then people started saying black and I never liked it.」

Then he revealed how greatly he underrated his own authority:「Justice Marshall said he chose Afro-American rather than African American, now gaining currency, because ‘Afro-American is in the dictionary and the other one isn't.'「

Montaigne déjà avait trouvé en sa Gascogne et dans sa tour de Montaigne, un style de génie, mais tout individuel et qui ne tirait pas à conséquence. Pascal a trouvé un style à la fois individuel, de génie, qui a sa marque et que nul ne peut lui prendre, et un style aussi de forme générale, logique et régulière, qui fait loi, et auquel tous peuvent et doivent plus ou moins se rapporter: il a établi la prose française.

[Montaigne already had found in his Gascony and in his tower at Montaigne a style of genius, but a completely individual one that drew no followers. Pascal discovered a style at once individual, marked by genius, completely his own, that no one could take from him, and yet a general style, logical and regular, with the force of law, one that everyone can and should more or less adopt as a standard: he established French prose.]

— Sainte-Beuve, Port-Royal

Classic style, in the hands of its master practitioners, can be distinctive without appearing to be personal. Its implicit claim is that it does not depend upon the writer's personality for its effects. Sainte-Beuve points to this feature of classic style in comparing two great French writers, Montaigne and Pascal.

It was, of course, the French educational bureaucracy in the nineteenth century that made Pascal's style something like「law」and decided that he had not merely demonstrated the powers of a style but「established French prose.」Still, the apparent paradox — the claim that Pascal's style is individual yet available to everyone and even more or less obligatory — is a consequence of the classic stand on truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language. Pascal is a reasonable model for pedagogical purposes precisely because his style is a general one. While no student is likely to achieve Pascal's level of mastery, the great usefulness of his style as a model is precisely that it is possible for almost anyone to achieve a working competence without needing either Pascal's exceptional abilities or his exceptional passion and sense of purpose. What is personal to him lies outside the style, for his principal achievement, on this view, is more in the nature of a discovery about writing than a written expression of his own thought. Classic style disavows superior powers of introspection or exceptional personal insight or exceptional personal commitment; it never abandons the implicit claim to be merely presenting what the reader, once properly situated, can verify. Its seventeenth-century French practitioners employed the style in a variety of literary forms: in personal correspondence, in books of maxims and moral portraits, in at least one notable work of fiction, and in the memoir literature that is a feature of seventeenth-century French prose. The memoirs of both La Rochefoucauld and his rival, the Cardinal de Retz, share all the essential marks of the style. While their observations are unmistakably their own, they never ask the reader to accept what they say on the strength of something that can belong only to them. Like all classic writers, they do all the work, they do it invisibly, and they suggest that, accidents of opportunity aside, the reader could do precisely what they are doing. As one nineteenth-century editor of Retz put it,

[L]a langue n'était évidemment pour lui [Retz] qu'un moyen de rendre sa pensée, ou plutôt de présenter habilement, sous un certain jour, les hommes, les événements, et en particulier ses propres actions.

[Language is evidently for him {Retz} only a way of presenting his thought, or better of ably presenting, on any given day, people, events, and especially his own actions.]

Dem schreibenden Herzog bietet sich die Erinnerung an Menschen und Auftritte mit so drängender Gewalt und so viel Fülle des Einzelnen, daß seine Feder kaum mit zukommen scheint, und er ist offenbar vollkommen uberzeugt, daß alles, was ihm einfällt, für das Ganze unentberhrlich ist und sich auch ins Ganze einordnen wird, ohne daß er im voraus dafür Sorge tragen muß.

[As Saint-Simon writes, memories of people and scenes come to him so urgently and with such an abundance of details that his pen seems hardly able to keep up with it all; and he is apparently quite convinced that everything that occurs to him is indispensable for the whole and that it will find its proper place there without his having to prepare for it in advance.]

— Erich Auerbach, Mimesis

Je le voyais bec à bec entre deux bougies, n'y ayant du tout que la largeur de la table entre deux. J'ai décrit ailleurs son horrible physionomie. Eperdu tout à coup par l'ouïe et par la vue, je fus saisi, tandis qu'il parlait, de ce que c'était qu'un jésuite, qui, par son néant personnel et avoué, ne pouvait rien espérer pour sa famille, ni, par son état et par ses vœux, pour soi-même, pas même une pomme ni un coup de vin plus que les autres; qui par son âge touchait au moment de rendre compte à Dieu, et qui, de propos délibéré et amené avec grand artifice, allait mettre l'Etat et la religion dans la plus terrible combustion, et ouvrir la persécution la plus affreuse pour des questions qui ne lui faisaient rien, et qui ne touchaient que l'honneur de leur école de Molina. Ses profondeurs, les violences qu'il me montra, tout cela me jeta en un tel (sic) extase, que tout à coup je me pris à lui dire en l'interrompant:「Mon Père, quel âge avez-vous?」Son extrême surprise, car je le regardais de tous mes yeux, qui la virent se peindre sur son visage, rappela mes sens. . . . [I saw him face to face between two candles, having nothing but the width of the table between the two of us. I have elsewhere described his horrible physiognomy. Bewildered suddenly by hearing and sight, I was seized, while he talked, with what a Jesuit was, who, through his personal and avowed nothingness, could hope nothing for his family, nor, through his condition and his vows, for himself, not even an apple or a drink of wine more than the others; who, through his age, was close to the moment of rendering his account to God, and who, of deliberate purpose, and brought about with great artifice, was going to put the State and religion into the most terrible combustion, and inaugurate the most frightful persecution for questions which meant nothing to him and which affected only the honor of their school of Molina. His depths, the violences which he showed me, all this threw me into such an ecstasy that I suddenly found myself saying, interrupting him:「Father, how old are you?」His extreme surprise, for I was looking at him with all my eyes, which saw it painted on his face, called back my senses. . . .]

— Saint-Simon, as quoted in Erich Auerbach, Mimesis

In Mimesis, the Romance philologist Erich Auerbach offers a series of virtuoso stylistic analyses of the type known as explication de texte. The passages he has selected are arranged in a chronological sequence beginning with Homer and the sacred scripture of ancient Israel and ending with selections from Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust. In keeping with the subject of his book, whose subtitle in its English translation is「The Representation of Reality in Western Literature,」the sequence of passages he discusses is conceived as an evolutionary progress of representational styles that depend increasingly for their effects on an evident asymmetry between writer and reader in their model cast. Here the classic style of Retz and Pascal is seen as formulaic and superficial compared with the next element of the sequence — the inimitably idiosyncratic performance of Saint-Simon, whose representations of individuals at the court of Louis XIV are incomparable not merely for their individuality and complexity but also for the drama of the writer's performance. Saint-Simon's prose is not a window but something like an acrobat's high wire, a platform for fantastic feats obviously beyond the reader's competence and just barely within the writer's. The writer is not so much competent as he is pushing the limits of his art, his language repeatedly tottering on the edge of syntactic incoherence but frequently achieving striking results that have the air of being part inspired genius, part happy accident.

Auerbach's claims for Saint-Simon are grounded in a conviction that the truth of human existence is very far from clear and simple; it is rather unknown and unknowable to any one individual, but reveals itself in historical processes, the dialectic counterpart of the individual projects that, seen as a sequence, unwittingly and progressively reveal what we know of human truth.

When historical particulars are seen not in the classic perspective as occasions for the revelation of eternal truth but rather in this romantic perspective as moments in the unfolding of a truth progressively revealed in history, classic style of presentation can be compared unfavorably to romantic styles of representation. This is exactly what Auerbach does.

His comparison of classic and romantic styles predictably reverses classic values. Its opening note is the preference for inspiration over rational order: the unpredictable insight that occurs in the very act of composition is preferred to the classic pattern of thought preceding speech. For a romantic like Auerbach, deliberate thought as a principle of expression guarantees a superficial and false vision; inspiration in the course of writing is a badge of authenticity and truth:「Everything that occurs to [Saint-Simon] in connection with his subject, he throws into his sentences just as it happens to come to mind, in full confidence that it will somehow fit together in unity and clearness.」For Auerbach, it is not a demerit that Saint-Simon may not see this unity and clearness, that he may merely serve as an inspired conduit to make it available to a future reader.

Classic style values the order of rational analysis as being reliable and not idiosyncratic; it distrusts the order of sensation and emotion as being unreliable, idiosyncratic, and often demonstrably wrong. Auerbach inverts this scale of values:

Saint-Simon obtains his most profound insights not by rationally analyzing ideas and problems but by an empiricism applied to whatever sensory phenomenon happens to confront him and pursued to the point of penetrating to the existential. In contrast (to mention an obvious example) the Jesuit priest of the first [of Pascal's] Lettres provinciales was quite clearly stylized on the basis of a preceding rational study.

This preference for following sensation as it brings unpredictable glimpses of truth is sensible on the romantic view that truth is elusive and never to be seen whole. If truth will not sit still for rational analysis, but comes only in suggestive fragmentary vision, then the writer must always write in fear that at any second whatever fragments of it have come to him will slip away. This intermittent and unpredictable pulse of revelation produces a romantic urgency to capture both the sensation and what it may suggest. This model is unthinkable in classic style, since truth is fully visible to any competent person and cannot slip away. Classic truth can never evaporate. As a result, classic presentation is characterized by calm and ease — a calm and ease that for Auerbach is a hallmark of complacency and self-deception.

[T]he urgency of an inner impulse gives [Saint-Simon's] language something unusual, at times something violent and immoderately expressive, which runs counter to the ease and pleasantness which appealed to the taste of the time.

Auerbach conceives of the truth of human nature as consisting of「profondeurs opaques」: perception of truth will necessarily come in exceptional fragments at exceptional moments to exceptional people. It will come when the observer does not expect it. Saint-Simon, for example, in the middle of a conversation with the Jesuit, Père Tellier, is seized, according to Auerbach, by a revelation of「the essential nature of any strictly organized solidaritarian community.」This conception of truth is of course entirely foreign to classic style. On Auerbach's view, it is a sign of integrity for a writer to present fragments of opaque profundities incompletely perceived as they offer themselves to the individual genius. On the classic view, such a presentation can only be definitive proof of failure. In classic style, the expression is a presentation of the result of thought. Writing that does not meet this description is incompetent by classic standards, but superior for Auerbach:

The non-fictitious, non-precogitated quality of his material, its being drawn from immediate appearances, gives Saint-Simon a depth of life which even the great decades' most important portrayers of character, Molière for example or La Bruyère, could not achieve.

In the classic view, this judgment is simply unintelligible because the evidence offered to support the claim seems to be evidence against it. This judgment has, in the classic view, the same logic as「Guesses are better than accurate knowledge because they are more personal.」

Individual genius as Auerbach describes it consists of fragmentary and unpredictable visions. The writer cannot control them. Anything that can be controlled in a rational fashion is superficial artifice, not profound truth. Genius is charismatic — blessed with prophetic, inspirational moments of vision, much as E. B. White was momentarily blessed with a glimpse into the nature of time as he recorded his impressions of the girl riding her horse around the circus ring. Neither Saint-Simon nor E. B. White can count on such revelations. They may never come to these writers again; they may never come to the reader at all. What is virtue for Auerbach is egoistical delusion for classic style.

Jane Austen's unforgettable presentation of Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice — regular and deliberate as it is — will inevitably appear to be on Auerbach's scale of values facile and superficial.

Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

From the classic perspective, the virtue of Jane Austen's presentation is that once she has shown you where to look, her appraisal of Mr. Collins can be independently「verified」by any reader (just as it is by her characters). Saint-Simon gives a virtuoso presentation of Père Tellier and recounts his insight into the nature of the Jesuits, but while someone else might be able to verify Saint-Simon's presentation of the Jesuit of horrible physiognomy, no one else could follow the route from the physical description of one Jesuit to the revelation of the essential nature of the order. This route from the impression of one individual to a presumed knowledge of a whole community is precisely what Jane Austen means by「prejudice.」Pride and Prejudice turns on the representation of Elizabeth Bennet's repentance for having followed this route to self-deception. What is revelation in Saint-Simon is prejudice in Jane Austen.

Mimesis is a fable about the evolutionary history of style in which later steps in the process are necessarily superior to earlier steps. It is possible for Auerbach to see a particular writer such as Saint-Simon as an almost miraculous mutation exhibiting the shape of the future:「In his level of style, Saint-Simon is a precursor of modern and ultra-modern forms of conceiving and representing life.」Truth, for Auerbach, is not the property of an individual, indeed not essentially available to individuals: it resides in dialectical process — the historicist actions of epochs rather than the historical actions of individuals. The value of the individual writer consists in his degree of participation in that dialectical process. The individual genius of a great writer, then, consists in his seeing through immediate persons and events to the truth of the evolutionary historicist progression. Saint-Simon's excellence consists exactly in his being the first to glimpse a higher stage of epochal truth, as Auerbach remarks in his analysis of Saint-Simon's presentation of the duchesse de Lorge:

We must wait until the late nineteenth century and indeed actually until the twentieth, before we again find in European literature a similar level of tone, a synthesis of a human being which is so entirely free from traditional harmonizing, which presses so unswervingly on from the random data of the phenomenon itself to the ultimate depths of existence.

On such a view, it is possible for Auerbach to place agency in epochs and their sequence rather than in individuals; to write, for example, of the「ease and pleasantness that appealed to the taste of the time,」as if times have tastes, rather than individuals. In Auerbach's formulation, an earlier taste is necessarily a less adequate taste. Although earlier tastes may survive into the future to be contemporary with later tastes, they will occupy lower levels on the historicist Great Chain of Adequacy. Auerbach implies that, luckily, the taste for ease and pleasantness lies now in our evolutionary past; it is nearly unimaginable for us now — who live higher on the evolutionary scale of style — to understand the tastes that previous styles created.

Since Auerbach's measure of stylistic maturity values writing to the extent that it penetrates through local and individual human purpose to historicist truth, he naturally discounts the individual purposes of writers as impediments to the representation of truth. The more a writer includes and the less he selects according to his own purpose, the more likely it is that his writing will touch upon those truths that are essentially beyond him. The less he allows his writing to be controlled by「precogitated」individual purpose, the more likely it is that truth will work though him as its conduit. The result, in Auerbach, is a principled blindness to the individual purposes of writers he regards as superficial in comparison with Saint-Simon. Pascal's presentation of a Jesuit in the first of the Lettres provinciales, for example, is in the service of classic polemic; Pascal has no need or reason to present a rich and randomly detailed description of an individual Jesuit. But for Auerbach, Pascal's principle of presentation, efficiently governed as it is by his immediate purpose, makes it unlikely that truth, which always lies beyond local purpose, will work through him.

Pascal, like all classic writers, speaks for himself; writers that Auerbach admires hardly speak at all; it is the historical age that speaks through them. The voice of Auerbach's individual genius is not his own; it is the voice of Hegelian historical progress.

Since Auerbach's history presumes to know and to reveal the one ultimate purpose of writing, it can value one style absolutely above all others. Learned and inclusive as Auerbach is, his history is an ideological justification of the universal superiority of that single style, one that has not yet nor ever will be fully manifest in any text by any writer.

Classic style, a general style suitable for presenting the truth of anything, conceived as discrete and self-contained, has no continuing evolutionary history. It can be found in its perfect form in Thucydides, in Madame de Sévigné, in Jane Austen, in A. J. Liebling. It is not the style to which all previous writing aspires. Classic style is one style among many mature and consistent styles. Its virtues follow from its particular stand on the elements of style. They include the clarity and simplicity that come from matching language to thought on the motive of truth. Other styles have other virtues.

0601 风格的误区

不同场合需要不同风格

选段 6-1

当那个解放事业开始以后，我就一点也不害怕。我认为自己在其他国家的学者中所听到的对宗教法庭的抱怨，决不会被我们同样博学的人在议会执政期间提出来抱怨书籍出版许可制。然而事实上这种抱怨却如此普遍地产生了，当我表示自己同情他们的不满时，如果不致见怪的话，我倒要引证一个事例来说明当时的清况：以往有一个财务官很得西西里人的爱戴，后未听到西西里人一再指控维列斯。我国有许多尊敬诸位而又受到诸位尊敬的人，他们向我们颂扬诸位的话决不会少于西西里人民的控告。然而他们却一再劝说和请求我决不要灰心失望，而要把我在公正理性的指导下为争取废除这一奴役学术的制度所产生的想法提供出来。

—— 约翰·弥尔颜，《论出版自由》① 1

① 汉译文出自吴之椿翻译版本。—— 译者注

这个选段有 142 个单词，几乎不可能一遍读懂。虽然这段话表面上是一篇议会演讲稿，但它的风格不是演讲，而且有意偏离任何可能的对话形式。它没有指示明确方向或目标的意象图式。它不具备任何古典风格特征，与同时期法国散文最突出的风格形成鲜明对比。

任何一位现代写作顾问都会忍不住用常规方式修改这句话 —— 要不是它出自十七世纪的著名文本，三百年来被世界各地的人们研读和称颂。这样一位写作顾问会特别注重表达清晰，会提供一些有效的建议改写《论出版自由》以便读者理解。但是，在弥尔顿看来，这些修改完全破坏了他那种成熟卓越的风格，结果也证明他是对的。

清晰既是古典风格的主要优点，也是实用风格的主要优点，很容易用这两种通用风格的任一标准评价其他风格，尤其是那些经常使用二者之一的作者。像实用风格一样，古典风格支持这类评价，暗自主张成为通用风格。但这种主张容易引起误导。古典风格和实用风格都无法实现弥尔顿的目的，因为他的典型场景不是古典风格或实用风格的核心场景。从这点来说，这段话像塞缪尔·约翰逊在《莎士比亚戏剧集序言》开头评论的那样：弥尔顿和约翰逊写出来的风格成熟一致，但和古典风格或实用风格格格不入。古典风格背后的典型场景是对话，因此往往以独立片段出现，摘录的选段也很好理解。《论出版自由》背后的典型场景需要淋漓尽致地展现苦心孤诣的博学。这种场景最看重的是气势庄严和引经据典一而非文笔清晰。它所用的模式不是对话，甚至都不是口头英语；它用的是书面拉丁语模式。弥尔顿的典型场景对他的风格的影响是，单独摘录的片段几乎无法理解，但弥尔顿不会因此把这看作缺陷。他没打算让《论出版自由》以小片段的形式流传，而且让他用一种看起来容易阅读或方便小段选摘的风格，他必定会很难受。假若按照拉罗什福科或李伯龄的风格重写《论出版自由》，弥尔顿的读者肯定当即给它贴上不值一读的标签。

苏格拉底在《苏格拉底的申辩》里提到古典风格的一条检验标准，仿佛它是所有风格的首要问题：「如果你在这个城市的露天场所（你们很多人听过我演讲的地方）或其他地方，听到我用惯用的那种语言为我自己辩白，不要觉得惊讶。」2

他明确拒绝采用法庭那种有腔有调的风格，他暗指这种风格有虚情假意的成分。他采用对话、声音和即兴作为他的典型场景，所以很容易从他的演讲里摘录出通俗易懂的独立话语片段。毕竟《苏格拉底的申辩》加上极少注释翻译过来后，完全能被现在的俄勒冈州或俄亥俄州或上海市的读者读懂，哪怕读者对公元前四世纪初雅典法庭的公约一无所知。

相比之下，想象一位雅典演说家的演讲，和苏格拉底不一样，他的主要目标是要赢得这场审判。当然，上海市或俄亥俄州的现代读者不可能去想这些事情的细节。这样一篇演讲的一些精妙之处，很难被注意到或者很难被理解，就像弥尔顿在《论出版自由》中使用的复杂句法和引用的典故一样。如果不能像弥尔顿（或者那位雅典演说家）那样理解促成他风格的场景，就不可能「改良」他的风格。现今只有少数精通十七世纪英国议会历史的专家才通晓这样的知识，但不见得有谁能用弥尔顿希望的方式以及他自己表达出来的方式，向议会发表演讲。一般的原则（比如「删掉不必要的词」）无法替代场景和角色这类决定某种风格的具体知识，因为只有它们才能表明哪些词不必要。

进段 6-2

虽然之前我已经向你们表明我们的体系中很可能会有，也确实可能有足够的货币刺淡措施未创造「经济复苏」，但我不确定我们是否不需要一些保险措施或不需要重新讨论这个问题，我只能对你们说，我们都在观望渗透其中的同一套数据、同一经济体、同一种信心。我们都在决判经济活动如何演变以及采取各种不同行动的风险在哪里。将来这不可避免会有分歧。

—— 国会听证会上参议员试图让格林斯潘降低利率加速经济复苏（1992 年 3 月），美联储主席阿兰·格林斯潘对此的回应 3

《纽约时报》1992 年 4 月 20 日报道的格林斯潘这段话，当然不是古典风格的例子，但它是一种确定的风格，一种高素质的风格。因为它首先是口语风格（尽管是发表在报纸上供人阅读的报告），格林斯潘先生把它称作「没有条理的喃喃自语」。它的优点恰恰是古典风格的缺点，不应该把这种风格的表现和演讲者的表达能力相混淆。它不是一种含糊的风格，尽管有时看起来这样，因为作者实际表达的结论和观点并没有被隐藏，只是淹没在令人困惑的冗词中了。这更像是一种僵局风格，表达方式依据的是运动不一致且不对称的意象和变化多端的限定条件。它不像古典风格那种通用风格；它是一种特殊风格，专门服务于少部分位居美联储主席这类高位的人，这些人权力很大，他们说的话会被别人用来细致分析他们可能的行动。如果细读上面那段话可以发现，它丝毫没有透露，格林斯潘会降低还是不会降低利率，他是否已经在这个问题上做出了决定，甚至他是否赞成降低利率可以带来参议员们以为的效果。有影响力的政策负责人不得不回应公众时，古典风格的优点可能是他的灾难。国会听证会的调查对象应该看上去是尊重委员会的，所以像阿兰·格林斯潘这样的人不能说：「我来这里是因为我必须在这里，但我不会告诉你们任何东西。」这种场景的情况比较特殊，应该让人觉得他实际上可能说了一些实质性内容，还要尽可能避免说些明显要进一步澄清的问题。如果格林斯潘说，「我认为我们已经把利率降得足够低了，但我们正在不断监测进展，也许到某个时候有可能进一步降低利率。我会适时采取我认为有必要的行动，可能你们不一定认为有必要。」可以更清楚地表达他的主要观点，但要为此付出不可接受的代价。他用一种明确的方式向参议员表明，他会做他认为最好的事，不管他们怎么想的都不会影响他，这种做法不够明智，而且他也不希望明确否定他们的建议，因为无论他表明会还是不会降低利率都对他不利，表明他何时会下定决心也同样不利。前面假定的修改版本当然更清楚，但会引来恼人的追问：那么就目前来说，您已经不考虑降低利率了？未来什么情况下，降低利率是合理的？你是依据什么指标判断出目前的利率太高？

必须避免引发所有这类提问，因为他实际上不希望透露自己之后的任何行动方向。他对可能的行动给出的任何暗示，都会引发不同市场的回应。在这种情况下，「虽然之前我已经向你们表明我们的体系中很可能会有，也确实可能有，足够的货币刺激措施来创造…」，这句活在名方面都会优于「我认为我们已经把利事降得足够低了」。这种声明附加各种限定条件，也没明确生效日期或谈论内容，虽然看起来做了让步，但实际上对他可能要做的事只字未提。「虽然我在过去的某个时候说过某事 X」，让听众以为下一句是「现在我要说说某事 Y」。实际的顺序不是这样，接着的那句话完全不符合预期，而且极其混乱不清，以至于读者很难立即认清其实没有做出任何让步。事后分析后可能才生出疑惑，但他甚至仍然认为已经采取了足够的措施「来创造」（创造什么呢？厌烦的读者会问），因为整个句子的框架是「之前我已经向你们表明」，但后面没有对等地提到讲话人现在要讲什么。为避免说成毫无防范的现在陈述语气或一瞬间就能被识别出来的确定主张，格林斯潘使用了微妙的语言资源：情态动词、模棱两可的参照、疑问副词、不确定的将来时或不确定的现在进行时。

从这个选段及其特殊场景考虑的特别要求中，我们得到两点提示：第一，某种风格的缺点会成为另一种风格的优点；第二，不是只有好与坏两种风格之分，而是有很多种风格，有些是通用风格，有些只适用于特定场景。几乎所有的英文作文教师都会说这个选段「需要修改」，然后指出它的错误之处。事实上，它哪里都没错。这是一种高超的表达方式，把迟迟不作答复的态度伪装成语言表达上的不连贯。它写得一点也不马虎，也并非毫无计划。它故意违反预期中前后对称、方向一致的意象图式，运用精湛的技巧阻断了这种预期。这是一种非常准确的表达，就像一只猫跳上一张杂乱无章的桌子，走过一片狼藉，却没有搅乱这片狼藉。

表面特征不决定风格

选段 6-3

本备忘录…...讨论的话题可以说是作者和出版商遇到的问题中最不重要的部分。正是因为它们相对来说没那么重要（尽管它们也有可能带来麻烦），所以我们应该不用太把心。换句话说，我们的工作就是让它们不成问题，以便将我们的精力投入到更重要的事情中 —— 作者和编辑发挥才智和想象力平衡事实和表达，设计师和排版人员做出高效精美的排版，校对人员保证快速准确的勘误。

虽然逗号风格的一些问题（例如，限定性从句与非限定性从句，一个用逗号隔开主从句，一个不用遮号隔开），在日常表达中已经根深蒂固，以至于成为某类规则，但几乎所有这些都只是偏好问题。我们更偏向列举事物时在连词前用逗号（red, white, and blue），也会在「i. e.（也就是）」和「e. g.（例如）」之后加逗号。

——《作者、编辑、排版人员、校稿人的原稿准备和校样处理备忘录》，普林斯颜大学出版社，1990 年 1 月

在事倍功半这点上，英语拼写体系符合那些人尽皆知的规范的全部要求。它过时、累赞又低效：掌握英语拼写需要花大量时间和精力：一旦拼错，很容易被发现。

—— 托斯丹·凡勃仑，《有闲阶级论》4

对于只在英文写作课上读过写作指南或手册的读者，普林斯顿大学出版社备忘录的态度可能让他们感到惊讶，因为在他们的写作课上，大写、拼写、发音和用法看起来不仅是写作最明显的表面特征，实际上是写作的全部。这种本末倒置的问题很常见，正因为这些偶然因素容易被注意到。这是为什么托斯丹·凡勃伦在一本古典风格社会学著作中提到，拼写体现了某种形式的社会差异，有闲暇的人才能学会一种随机又低效的体系。地名的发音和拼写这类问题，常常用作区分当地人和外地人的标记。一位杰出的美国神学家在高速公路上开车，中途停下来问贝洛伊特（Beloit）怎么走，当地人听到他的法语发音方式「贝瓦」（Bell- wah）后哈哈大笑，然后告诉他说，「是贝洛伊特（Beh-LOIT），伙计。你现在在威斯康星州了。」

偶然因素几乎不会成为风格要素的一部分，但是如果不妥善对待，它们会带来各种大大小小的问题，因为它们体现了作者对写作规则和规范的掌握程度。有人认为字典和手册规定了这些问题，这是一种常见的误解。字典和手册只不过是尽可能符合某个没有明确定义的人群的说话习惯，是他们规定了这类问题普遮的偏好限制。词典编辑的立场跟不希望因某种错误方式惹人注目的个人一样。但跟他们很多人不同的是，词典编辑自知只是观察一场社会影响力比赛，而不是记录 —— 更不是定义 —— 某种正确的立场。

露易丝·布鲁克斯一定是默片年代所有性感偶像中最优秀的一位作家，她在《露露在好菜坞》这本书里解释说，她意识到自己有堪萨斯口音时很痛苦，因为这让她在纽约看起来像外乡人。她在一家经常光顾的杂货店的饮料柜前，遇到一位哥伦比亚大学的学生，她说尽好话，让他做她的语言老师。用她自己的话说就是：

不读「mulk」读「milk」，不读「kee-yow」读「cow」。还有：不要像读「hotter」一样读成「watter」，要像读「daughter」一样读「water」。不是「help」，你真是乡巴佬一读「help」「hep」「help」！吃了一个月的巧克力圣代，这个男孩用他自己的方法教我词汇，我讨厌的堪萨斯口音连最后一点痕迹都没有了。从一开始，我就想好了，不能从一种标签换成另一种标签。我不想学艾娜·克莱尔、鲁斯·查特顿那些正统的喜剧明星，说一本正经的伦敦舞台英语。我只想说一口纯正的、不带标签的英语。我在饮料柜前认识的小伙儿说的就是纯正的、不带标签的英语。5

露易丝·布鲁克斯认为在二十世纪二十年代的纽约，一位性感尤物不能经常把「cow」说成「ke-yow」，这种想法无疑是对的，但是由此认定她已经会说「无标签」英语，就大错特错了。她只是放弃了一个不合时宜的标签，换上一个与她努力塑造的形象更相符的标签。且不说绝原先的堪萨斯口音，她跟那位饮料柜前的纽约小伙儿学会的「纯正的无标签英语」，如果在路易斯安那州的巴吞鲁日听起来会怎样呢？在得克萨斯州的沃思堡呢？在伊利诺伊州的芝加哥呢？又或者在布鲁克林区大桥对面呢？

同样的社会原则适用语言的许多显著特征，但这些特征都不能决定语言风格。「Negro」（黑鬼）这个词已从现代美式英语用法中剔除，后来出现的替代语「black」（黑人）也逐渐被摒弃。「黑鬼」的古老用法是什么时候出现的，谁决定了这个问题？当然不是美国的词典。它们只是调查目前的词语用法，直到确定这种变化被广泛接受。今天，同样的现象也出现在「black」（黑人）这个词上，它本身很快就会在日常使用过程中被海汰，被「Afro-American」或「African American」（非裔美国人）其中一个词取代。哪个词会赢得这场竞争取决于谁最先被广泛使用。

所有这些竞争会引起许多作者和演讲者的焦虑，因为用词「不当」会让作者或演讲者看起来可笑。因此，自称语言大师的人总有大片的市场，而且每家书店都有整排的语言规范手册，好像所有这些问题都已经解决了似的，虽然这些书之间总不免会相互矛盾。出版商及其技术人员倒没有什么幻想；他们知道用母语说话或写作的人只是社会地位不同，没有谁是语言权威。他们也知道虽然偶然的问题可能会带来尴尬，但无论用词多么准确，也不可能形成一种风格，而且太过担心偶然问题，反而可能损害风格。二十世纪二十年代有很多女演员把「cow」说成「kee-yow」，但她们中没有一个能塑造出露易丝·布鲁克斯塑造出的那种形象。而且，假如露易丝·布鲁克斯太想发音准确而表现得焦虑，她将破坏那种形象。

有时候即使有非凡影响力的人，也会误解这方面的问题。《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》报道了瑟古德·马歇尔 1989 年决定在一份以美国最高法院副法官身份提交的书面意见中使用「Afro-American」一词。

一开始，这位声名显赫的法官解释自己的动机：「我花了大半生时间，费尽心思让人们拼写 Negro 这个词时大写首字母… 后来人们开始改用 black，我从来都不喜欢这个词。」6 

然后他说自己当初如何严重低估了自己的权威：「马歇尔法官说他会用 Afro-American，而不是 African American，现在前一个词越来越流行，因为‘词典收录了 Afo-American 但没收录另一个词 。」

优势可能是缺陷

选股 6-4

蒙田在他的家乡加斯科湿和他的蒙田塔楼里，就已经发现一种天才风格，但那是一种完全个人化的风格，很难效仿。帕斯卡发现了一种风格 —— 既是一种带天才属性的个性化风格，完全属于他自己，任何人都无法夺走，又是一种有逻有规律的通用风格，有法则般的力量，每个人戎多或少都能、也应该采用的一种标准 —— 他开创了法国救文。

—— 圣伯夫，《波尔-罗雅尔修道院史》7

在行家里手的笔下，古典风格可以独具一格，又不显得个人化。它默认无须依赖作者的个性形成风格。圣伯夫在对比蒙田和帕斯卡两位伟大的法国作家时，指出了古典风格的这种特征。

当然，正是十九世纪的法国教育官僚主义使帕斯卡的风格成为类似「法则」一样的风格，也决定了他不仅展示出一种风格的力量，而且「开创了法国散文」。尽管如此，这种明显的悖论 —— 声称帕斯卡的风格既能保留个性，又能为每个人所用，甚至多多少少还是一种规定 —— 源自古典风格在真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言上采取的立场。从教学目的上来说，帕斯卡可以说是典范，因为他的风格恰是一种通用风格。

没有学生可能达到帕斯卡那种精通水平，但他的风格作为典范的用处在于，几乎任何人都可以掌握基本能力，且不需要帕斯卡那样的非凡才能，也不需要他那种特别的热情和使命感。只属于他个人的东西不属于古典风格，从这点来看，他的主要成就更多在于对写作的发现，而不是对他自己的思想的书面表达。古典风格并不要求出众的反思能力、非凡的个人洞见，或突出的个人努力；它自始至终默认的主张是，只呈现读者站在合适位置就能自己验证的内容。十七世纪的法国作者将这种风格运用到各种文学形式上：个人信函、道德箴言录、至少一部知名小说，以及代表十七世纪法国散文特色的回忆录文学。拉罗什福科和他的对手莱兹两人的回忆录，都具备古典风格所有的重要特征。虽然他们的观察结果确实是他们自己观察来的，但他们从不要求读者接受完全个人化的表达。像所有古典风格作者一样，他们要做所有工作，而且不能被察觉到，他们暗示，他们在做的事情，（除一些碰机会的偶然事物外）读者都能做到。正如十九世纪莱兹的一位文学编辑所说：

对他（莱兹）来说，语言显然只是一种呈现他的思想的方式，或者更妙地，可以信手拈来呈现任何一天的人、事，尤其是他自己的行为。8

选段 6-5

对人物和场景犹如潮涌、充满细节的回忆，让这位写回忆录的圣西门公舞感到自己的笔几乎吸不上。显然圣西门完全相信，对梦个回忆录来说，他所能记起的一切是不可或缺的，并且他色可以把所有的一切安括进去，无须事先考虑取舍。

—— 埃里希·奥尔巴赫，《尊仿论》① 9

① 汉译文出自吴麒级、周新建、高艳婷合译版本，本书其他（模仿论》选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

他坐在来子对面，两根蜡烛之间，我们面对面，中间只有一张来子的宽度。我刻意描绘了他那可怕的表情。突然我被看到的和听到的所震撼，他谈论起什么才是一个教士：无论以其个人还是公众身份，一个教士都无法为他的家人做什么，也不可能用他的地位和权利为自己谋私利，甚至不可能比别人多一个草果或多一杯酒：只有到了一定的年龄才可能与上帝会面：处心积忠的阴谋会把国家和教会置于水深火热之中，并会因为一些涉及莫利那学派声誉的问题而纠缠不休。他的深奥，他所表现出的粗暴，所有这一切都令我迷茫，于是我打断他问道：「我的上帝，您多大岁数了？」他是那么的惊讶，因为我全神贯注地看着他，他那种惊讶呈现在脸上，唤醒了我的意识…...

—— 埃里希·奥尔巴赫，《摹仿论》引用圣西门的话 10

在《禁仿论》一书里，罗曼语语言学家埃里希·奥尔巴赫提供了一系列精彩的风格分析，分析类型为文本解释（explication de texte）。他按照时间顺序编排他选出来的文章，开头是荷马和古代以色列的宗教圣典，结尾是弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫和马塞尔·普鲁斯特的选段。这本书美泽版的副标题「The Representation of Realityin Westen Literature」（西方文学中现实的再现）反映了他的书的主题，他讨论的文章的排序体现了该主题，被认为是反映了再现型风格的演变进程，这类再现型风格的效果越来越取决于作者与读者的典型角色要求的明显对等关系。在这里，菜兹和帕斯卡的古典风格被认为俗套和肤浅，而圣西门的表现奇特且不拘一格，他描绘的路易十四宫廷人物无可比拟，不仅表现在人物的个性和复杂性上，还表现在戏剧性上。圣西门的散文不是一扇窗，而是杂技演员走的高空钢丝，这个平台上展现的高超技艺，显然超出了读者的能力，而且作者也只能勉强驾驭。作者挑战他的艺术极限时并没有那么得心应手，他的语言时不时在句法不连贯的边缘踉跄，但又常常取得惊人的结果，部分源于天才的灵感，部分源于幸运的巧合。

奥尔巴赫对圣西门的评价基于一种信念：人类生存的真相远非清晰简单；对任何一个个体来说，它都是未知且不可知的，但在历史进程中展示了自己，即个体的对立统一面，这些个体被看作一种序列，不知不觉中逐渐揭示了我们认识的人类真相。

古典风格视角把具体的历史事件看作揭示永恒真相的场合，而浪漫主义视角把它看作真相在历史中逐渐展开时的某些时刻，从后者的视角来看，古典风格的呈现（presentation）不如浪漫风格的再现（representation）。这正是奥尔巴赫的选择。





他对古典风格和浪漫风格的这种比较，自然会推翻古典风格的价值。它开头的说明偏好灵感而非理性次序：构思过程中出现的不可预测的洞见优于古典模式中写作之前的深思熟虑。对于像奥尔巴赫这样的浪漫派来讲，深思熟虑后的表达只是肤浅而虚伪的幻象；写作过程中产生的灵感才是真实与真相的标志：「一切与他的主题相关的事物，他依照脑海中浮现的样子写进一个个句子，他完全相信统一清晰的句子会自然而然地形成。」11 对奥尔巴赫来说，圣西门可能没有看到这种统一和清晰，这不是缺陷，他可以充当一位灵感传导者，让未来的读者看到。

古典风格注重可靠而非个人化的理性分析次序；它不相信感觉和情绪上的体验次序，它们不可靠、过于个人化，而且常常被证明是错的。

奥尔巴赫则顺倒了这种价值标准：

圣西门的深刻认识不是通过对思想及问题的理性分析获得的，而是通过他面对的任意一个感官现象所产生的、深入生存内部的经脸。相反（为了引用一个易于理解的例子）《致外省人信礼》第一封信中的耶稣会士显然是按服上述理性认知而被风格化了。2

浪漫风格认为真相难以捉摸，难以窥见全貌，所以从浪漫风格视角来看，为瞥见不可预知的真相而追随感觉自然在情理之中。如果真相不是恒定不变可进行理性分析的，而只是闪现出暗示性的零星画面，那作者肯定总是写得诚惶诚恐，时刻担心脑海中闪现的灵感一瞬即逝。因为闪现的节奏是间歌且不可预测的，浪漫风格总是急于捕捉这种感觉以及它可能暗示的含义。这种模式在古典风格中是不可想象的，因为真相对任何有能力的人都完全可见，也不会一闪即逝。古典真相从不会消散。所以古典呈现从容而自在 —— 但这在奥尔巴赫看来是自负和自我欺骗的表现。

表达内心冲动的欲望使得（圣西门的）语言不同寻常，也偶有强词夺理、言过其实之处，与那个时代轻松自如、讨人喜欢的审美品位大相径庭。13

奥尔巴赫认为人性真相「深奥晦涩」（profondeurs opaques）：真相会表现成特殊的灵感碎片，在特殊的时刻被特殊的人发觉。它会在观察者没有预料到的时候出现。例如，圣西门在与耶稣会士泰利埃神父对话的过程中，根据奥尔巴赫的说法，顿悟到「任何组织严密的团体的根本性质」14 这一真相。当然，这种真相观念完全不属于古典风格。深奥晦涩的灵感碎片只能凭个人的才智捕捉到，在奥尔巴赫看来，作者呈现这些无法完全理解的碎片是正直的表现。但从古典视角来看，这样一种呈现只是失败的实证。在古典风格中，表达呈现的是思考的结果。不经思考的灵感捕捉式写作，对古典风格而言是缺陷，但对奥尔巴赫来说是优势：

书中没有虚构，没有编造，所有内容都出自作者的耳闻目睹，这使圣西门的作品有一种生活的深度。在这方面，甚至连几十年中以描写人物见长的莫里哀和拉布吕那尔都望尘莫及。15

古典风格认为，这种评价根本无法理解，因为用来支持该主张的证据看起来反倒对它不利。在古典风格看来，这种评价的逻辑无异于「猜测胜过正确认识，因为猜测更个人化」。

如奥尔巴赫所述，个人的才智由不可预见的碎片灵感构成，作者无法控制它们。任何能够用理性的方式控制的东西都是肤浅的技巧，而非深刻的真相。这种才智是一种特别恩赐 —— 可以在某些灵光一现的预见性时刻洞察真相，就像 E. B. 怀特记录他对绕着马戏圈骑马的女孩的印象时，短暂地警见了时间的性质。但不论是圣西门还是怀特，都不能指望这类启示。它们可能再也不会出现在作者的脑海中，它们可能永远都无法被读者捕捉到。奥尔巴赫认为的优点，对古典风格而言是自我错觉。

简·奥斯汀对《傲慢与偏见》中的柯林斯先生的描写令人印象深刻 —— 这已是深思熟虑的常规描写 —— 但用奥尔巴赫的价值标准看来，这必然也是流于肤浅。

柯林斯先生并不是个聪明人，他虽然受过教有，踏进了社会，但是先天的缺陷却没得到多少弥补。他长了这么大，大部分岁月是在他那个爱钱如命的文盲父亲的教导下度过的。他也算进过大学，但只是勉强混了几个学期，也没交上一个有用的朋友。

父亲的严厉管教使他养成了唯唯诺诺的习性，但是这种习性如今又给大大抵消了，因为他本来就是个蠢材，一下子过上了悠闲生活，难免会枫枫然起来，何况年纪轻轻就发了意外之财，自然会越发自命不凡。当时亨斯福德教区有个牧师空缺，柯林斯鸿运事通，得到了凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人的套识。他一方面敬仰凯瑟琳夫人的崇高地位，尊崇她作为自己的女思主，另一方面又非常看重自己，珍惜自己做教士的权威，做教区长的权利，这一切造就了他一身兼有微慢与恭顺、自负与谦单的双重性格。① 16

① 汉译文出自孙致礼翻译版本。—— 译者注

从古典风格的角度来看，简·奥斯汀的呈现优势在于，一旦她告诉你往哪里看，她对柯林斯先生的评价就可以由任何读者独立「验证」（就像她书中的人物脸证的那样）。圣西门运用精湛的手法描写泰利埃神父，并讲述了他对耶稣会士的本质的洞察，但是，虽然有些人或许能验证圣西门呈现的耶稣会士的可怕相貌，但除了作者本人没人能根据一位耶稣会士的外貌描述看出整个入群的本质。从对单个个体的印象推断出对整个群体的认识，这种思维模式正是简·奥斯汀所说的「偏见」。《做慢与偏见》描述了伊丽莎白·班纳特从这种自欺欺人的思维模式中悔悟的故事。圣西门的真相启示在简·奥斯汀看来是偏见。

《禁仿论》是一本关于风格演变史的书，这必然是后来者居上的事情。奥尔巴赫可能会把某个特定的作家，比如圣西门，看作一种能展示未来生活的神奇突变：「从文体上说，圣西门是描述各种现代和最现代的人生观和再现生活的先驱。」17。对奥尔巴赫来说，真相不是个人财产，实际上根本无法被个人拥有：它存在于一种辩证过程中 —— 存在于时代的历史主义行为而非个人的历史行为当中。个体作家的价值，体现在他在多大程度上参与了这一辩证过程。也就是说，一位伟大作家的个人才能，在于他能通过直接的人和事，看到进化历史主义进程中的真相。圣西门的成就在于，他是第一个瞀见更高阶段的时代真相的人，正如奥尔巴赫分析圣西门对洛尔日公爵夫人（duchesse de Lorge）的描述时所言：

到十九世纪未，甚至直到二十世纪，人们才在欧洲文学中我到一个类似的语调，一个完全脱离传统和谐，直接从任意的表象信息深入到一个人生存环境的综合体。18

按照这种观点，奥尔巴赫有可能为不同时代及其发展进程赋予能动性，而不是将其赋予在个人身上；比如他写道，「那个时代轻松自如、讨人喜欢的审美品位」，就好像时代有品位，而不是个人。在奥尔巴赫的表述中，早期的品位必然不够完善。虽然早期的品位可能会延续到未来，与后期的品位融于同一个时代，但它们将在历史主义的距大完善链（Great Chain of Adequacy）位置。埃里希·奥尔巴赫透露，轻松自如和讨人喜欢的品位现已成为演变史的过去，几乎不可能让今天的我们 —— 处于风格等级演变史较高位置的我们 —— 理解以前的风格创造出来的品位。

在奥尔巴赫看来，判断风格是否成熟的标准在于写作能否超越当前的及个人的人类目的传达历史主义真相，他自然也认为个人目的会阻码真相再现。作者涵盖的内容越广泛，按个人目的选择的内容越少，他的文章就越可能触及超脱他个人的真相。尽可能减少「事先谋划」的个人目的对文章的影响，真相越有可能选择他作为传达者。所以奥尔巴赫从原则上忽视非圣西门一流的肤浅作家的个人目的。比如，帕斯卡在《致外省人信札》第一封信里对耶稣会士的描写，就服务于古典风格论辩：帕斯卡没有必要也没有理由，巨细无遗地随机描写某个个体耶稣会士。但奥尔巴赫认为，帕斯卡这种呈现原则，实际上是为了实现他当前的目的，因此超脱个体目的存在的真相不可能通过帕斯卡传达给读者。

像所有古典风格作者一样，帕斯卡为自己说话；奥尔巴赫推崇的作者几乎从不说话；是历史年代在通过他们说话。奥尔巴赫通过个人才智发出的声音，不是他自己的声音，是黑格尔派历史进程发出的声音。

因为奥尔巴赫的演变史是要认识和揭示写作的终极目的的，所以它追求一种优于所有其他风格的风格。尽管奥尔巴赫博学而包容，他的演变史只是从意识形态上证明了他那一种风格胜过所有风格，但不曾也不会有任何作者写出任何文本充分体现这种风格。

作为一种适合呈现任何事物真相的通用风格，古典风格自成一体，没有连续的演变历史。修昔底德、塞维涅夫人、简·奥斯汀、李伯龄写出了完美的古典风格。并不是以前的每篇文章都用古典风格写。它只是众多成熟一致的风格中的一种。它的优势源于它对风格要素采取的特定立场，包括清晰和简单，因为语言可匹配思想，动机是真相。其他风格也都有其各自的优势。
