## 0101. Principles of Classic Style

### 1.5 Other Stands, Other Styles

There is nothing new in the idea that a style is effectively a stand on a small number of central issues, and therefore that many different mature styles are possible. Classical rhetoricians analyzed contrasting styles from this perspective, and routinely demonstrated that what was good or appropriate to one style might be bad or inappropriate to another. By contrast, many modern books on「style」have, for one reason or another, suggested that there are only two styles: good and bad. On closer inspection, it becomes apparent that each of these modern books is actually about one style, not about style generally. For example, Strunk and White or Williams and Colomb work from an implicit model of writing as meant to be read by either (a) an indefinite audience not defined by working roles but having more-or-less common cultural and social standards; or (b) a somewhat more definite audience of working professionals with corporately defined roles. What Strunk and White recommend is meant as good advice for the one style they have in mind; what Williams and Colomb recommend is good advice for the one style they have in mind. Both assume a single cast and a single scene. But consider texts with quite a different cast or scene, such as a diplomatic address opening peace negotiations in the Middle East, or Pericles' Funeral Oration, or Samuel Johnson's「Preface to Shakespeare,」or an address by Martin Luther King, Jr., to a large crowd of political activists. Were we to subject texts of this sort to editorial revision inspired by a careful study of Williams and Colomb or Strunk and White, the result would be simply the destruction of a style. These writers and speakers certainly break many of the「rules」to be found in Style and The Elements of Style, but that is because the styles discussed in those books are foreign to the styles chosen. It is unreasonable to expect that addressing a giant rally in Washington and writing a memo to the vice president for finance on the consequences of the new tax code should have lying behind them the same stylistic stand, or that either one of them should have the same stylistic stand as an article for The New Yorker or Johnson's explanation of Shakespeare's claim to our attention.

Classical textbooks such as Cicero's Orator, the pseudo-ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Demetrius's On Style list principal styles and explain their origins in different purposes, motives, or occasions. The standard list includes high, middle, and low style, otherwise called grand, middle, and simple. Demetrius gives instruction in restrained, elevated, elegant, and forcible style. Aristotle in the Rhetoric notes in passing that each kind of rhetoric has its own appropriate style: for example, the style of political speech cannot be the style of forensic speech because their originary purposes, scenes, and casts are opposed.

Classical rhetoricians routinely analyze the relationships between distinct styles. Elegant style, Demetrius explains, can unite with restrained style, but elevated style cannot, because elevated style and restrained style「stand in irreconcilable opposition and contrast」: their fundamental decisions are consistently incompatible.

Certain failures to achieve a successful style are so predictable and common as to constitute styles of their own, which might be called styles that do not succeed. The Rhetorica ad Herennium explains how swollen style, slack style, and meager style arise as particular kinds of failure to achieve grand, middle, or simple style, suggesting that each good style has at least one deformed double. Longinus introduces us to two deformed versions of sublime style, each of which is a product of a particular kind of failure to achieve it. Bloated style「comes from trying to outdo the sublime.」Adolescent style comes from puerility,「the opposite of greatness: abject, mean, smarmy, the lowest of faults. What is this puerility? Isn't it just obviously the academic attitude, where over-elaboration ends in frigid failure? Writers fall into this fault because they want to be uncommon and exquisite, and to impress everybody, and instead they founder upon the trash of affectation.」Such failures all come「from the same cause, namely, today's crazy passion for novel ideas.」

Surface marks of writing reflect the fundamental stands of individual styles, but surface marks do not constitute styles, and styles do not prescribe surface marks, even though styles can explain such marks. To Aristotle, excellence of style consists in being clear and not commonplace — this is a fundamental stand on the question of presentation. He then examines surface techniques that can help the writer to achieve clarity and distinction, and alerts us to typical errors at the surface level. Aristotle offers many examples, but the discussion of the surface in every case derives from an analysis of the base. Longinus does the same thing, walking us through a great range of surface marks appropriate to sublime style, and contrasting successful examples of the style with failed attempts, but he does not suggest that the style derives from surface marks appropriate to it.

The many such examples in classical rhetorical treatments, and the use of repeated examples as patterns on which students can model their own writing, should never be interpreted as suggesting that style consists of surface marks, or that if we imitate the surface marks, we achieve the style. This would be as foolish as imagining that by wearing the same kind of shoes as a great athlete and imitating the athlete's manner of tying the laces, we will become great athletes ourselves. Both Aristotle and Longinus recognize that without the fundamental stand, the surface marks form only a sorry and monstrous parody of the style. Neither of them would have endorsed the procedure of selecting one sentence for inspection and posing the question,「What is the style of this sentence?」For example, the sentence,「He died quietly」could occur with perfect appropriateness in a work whose style is plain, classic, romantic, contemplative, oratorical, sublime, prophetic, practical, or diplomatic. To recognize a style, one must recognize its fundamental stand on decisive questions, which will be reflected with greater or lesser skill in its level of expression.

The closest model in classical antiquity for our analysis of classic style is Longinus's analysis of「the sublime」in On the Sublime, perhaps the most brilliant treatment of a style ever written.

No reader can think that Longinus is trying to give a universal prescription for good writing; he analyzes the distinctive stand of one style, and is always aware that there are many others. Sublime style is distinct from other styles because it takes a distinct stand on the elements of style: truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language. Its cast, unlike the cast of classic style, does not involve a symmetric relationship between equals; its model scene is not conversation; the relationship of language to thought does not have the effect of either presentation or persuasion.「For the effect of genius is not to persuade the audience but rather to transport them out of themselves.」Sublime writing, or writing at moments when it achieves the style of sublimity, consequently has a character entirely different from that of writing whose purpose is to persuade through detailed and systematic argument, for in linear argument,「inventive skill and the due disposal and marshalling of facts gradually emerge from the whole tissue of the composition, rather than showing themselves in one or two touches: on the other hand, a well-timed flash of sublimity scatters everything before it like a bolt of lightning and reveals the full power of the speaker at a single stroke.」

Longinus situates the origin of sublime style fundamentally at the level of thought, not surface constructions: the prime and most powerful source of the sublime is「the command of full-blooded ideas.」A natural faculty of expression is of course indispensable to sublime style, but cannot provide sublime style. Longinus's view of the source of sublime style depends upon a view of the relationship between writer and reader as fundamentally asymmetric: the writer is gifted with a fabulous mind and a natural talent for expression, which we admire, and the effect of which is to transport us out of ourselves in ways that otherwise are probably not available to us.

Yet for all the asymmetry between writers of the sublime and students of this writing, Longinus offers students a curriculum that might help them cultivate a capacity for the sublime. This curriculum consists not in mastering and parroting certain surface patterns, but rather in training the mind:

Now, since the first, I mean natural genius, plays a greater part than all the others, here too, although it is rather a gift than an acquired quality, we should still do our best to train our minds into sympathy with what is noble and impregnate them again and again with high inspiration.「How?」you might ask. Well, elsewhere I have written something like this,「Sublimity is the true ring of a noble mind.」And so even without being spoken the bare idea often by itself wins admiration for its inherent genius. . . . In the first place, then, it is absolutely necessary to indicate the sources of the sublime and to show that the mind of the genuine orator must be neither small nor ignoble. For it is impossible that those whose thoughts and habits all their lives long are petty and servile should flash out anything wonderful, worthy of immortal life. No, a great style is the natural outcome of important thoughts, and sublime expressions naturally fall to people with spirit.

In the spirit of Longinus, we would like now to clarify the stand of classic style on the elements of style and to contrast classic style with a selection of other mature and consistent styles.

0301 风格种种

1.5  立场不同则风格不同

一种风格，其实是对几个核心问题的一组立场，因此可能存在多种不同的成熟风格，这不是什么新观点。在这点上，古典修辞学家早就分析了对比鲜明的风格，意料之中的结论是，对某种风格有益或适宜的，可能对别的风格无益或不适宜。相反，许多现代书谈论「风格」，由于这样或那样的原因，认为风格只分好风格和坏风格两种。进一步考察，很明显这些书每本只谈到某种风格，而不是从总体上谈论风格。

比如，斯特伦克和怀特的《风格的要素》、威廉斯和科伦的《风格》，他们默认的写作模式面向两类读者：一类是不确定的读者，没有统一的职业角色，但或多或少有共同的文化和社会标准；另一类是比较确定的读者，一般是专业工作人员，有确定的职业角色。斯特伦克和怀特是针对他们心中的风格提出好建议；威廉斯和科伦则为他们心中的风格提出好建议。两种风格都只针对单一角色和单一场景。但想想角色和场景与之相异的文本，比如，启动中东和平谈判的外交致辞，或伯里克利的葬礼悼词，或塞缪尔·约翰逊的《莎士比亚戏剧集序言》，或马丁·路德·金面向一大群政治积极分子的演讲。如果让这类文本按照斯特伦克和怀特或者是威廉斯和科伦的建议编辑修订，只会破坏原本的风格。这些作者和演讲者当然违反了《风格》和《风格的要素》里提到的诸多规则，但那是因为他们用的风格不同于这些书讨论的风格。在一场盛大的华盛顿集会上发表演讲和就新税法的影响向财政部副部长写备忘录，是两种不同风格，不应认为它们是一样的风格立场，也不应把它们的任一立场等同于某篇《纽约客》的文章或约翰逊论述莎剧如何吸引观众的立场。

古典风格教材，比如西塞罗（Cicero）的《论演说家》（Orator）、托名为西塞罗所作的《献给赫伦尼厄斯的修辞学》（Rhetorica ad Herennium）和德米特里的《论风格》（On Style），列出了主要的风格类型，并从不同目的、动机或场合解释了它们的起源。标准的分类包括高等（high）、中等（middle）、低等（low）风格，亦称作宏大（grand）、中和（middle）和简朴（simple）风格。德米特里教授了矜持（restrained）、庄严（elevated）、优雅（elegant）和雄劲（forcible）风格。亚里士多德（Aristotle）在《修辞学》（Rhetoric）1 里提及每种修辞都有它适宜的风格，比如政治讲话的风格不可能是法庭讲话的风格，因为它们本身的目的、场景和角色截然不同。

古典修辞学家照例分析了不同风格间的关系。德米特里解释道，优雅风格可与矜持风格结合，但庄严风格不能，因为庄严风格和矜持风格「相互矛盾、不可共存」2，它们的立场始终无法兼容。

不足为怪的是，有些奔着好风格出发却因力不胜任而自成风格的，可能被称为坏风格。《献给赫伦尼厄斯的修辞学》解释了浮华 (swollen）、人松垮（(slack）和简硒（meager）风格分别是宏大、中和与简朴风格的某种次品，可见每种好风格至少对应一种坏风格。朗吉督斯向我们介绍了崇高（sublime）风格对应的两种坏风格，两者都是仿而未达的次品。浮夸（bloated）风格「是由于想超过崇高」3。幼雅（Adolescent）风格是因为天真，即「雄浑的反面；琐屑无聊，心胸狭窄，是最可鄙的弊病。幼稚究竟是什么呢？它可不显然是一种书呆子气，因为过于雕琢，而陷入想入非非的败笔吗？作家之所以陷于这种通病，是由于追求精致、巧妙，尤其是追求风趣，于是滚入琐屑无聊的泥潭中」。这些失败都是「同根生的，皆出自标新立异思想，这种思想已经成为时下流行的狂热了」4。

文章的表面特征能反映某种风格的基本立场，但表面特征不能构成风格，风格也没有规定哪些表面特征，尽管风格可以解释这些特征。亚里士多德认为，优秀的风格在于清晰且不落俗套 —— 这是呈现的基本立场。他分析了可以帮作者写得清晰鲜明的表面技巧，并提醒我们不要犯流于表面的通病。

亚里士多德举了许多例子，但每个案例的表面特征都是基于基本立场的分析。朗吉弩斯做了同样的事情，向我们逐一解释崇高风格表现出来的各种表面技巧，并对比了好风格与坏风格，但他并不认为风格源于对应的表面特征。5

汉译文选自缪灵珠译本《堡灵珠美学译文集》（第一卷）「论崇高」，本书其他「论崇高」选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

在古典修辞论述中有许多诸如此类的例子，而且一些经典句式被用作学生仿写的范例，但这不能看作风格由表面特征构成。或只要模仿表面特征就能写成这样的风格。这种想法太天真，就像以为穿上伟大运动员的同款鞋子，学他们系鞋带的方式，我们就能成为伟大的运动员一样。亚里士多德和朗吉弩斯都认为：没有基本立场，表面特征只是风格的一种拙劣、可怕的滑稽模仿。他们谁都不会认同单看某句话就判断「这句话是什么风格？」比如，「他安静地死了」这句话，可以完美适用平实风格、古典风格、浪漫风格、沉思风格、演说风格、崇高风格、先知风格、实用风格或外交风格。要辨识一种风格，必须要辨识它在决定性问题上采取的基本立场，这种立场表现在表达技巧上，有可能卓越，也有可能拙劣。

古典时期，最接近我们分析的古典风格的风格模型是，朗吉弩斯在《论崇高》中分析的「崇高风格」，它或许是书面记载的最精彩的风格论述。

读者很难想到，朗吉弩斯在尝试为好文章下一种普适的规定；他分析一种风格的鲜明立场，又总能意识到很多其他风格的存在。崇高风格不同于别的风格，因为它对真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言这些风格要素采取了鲜明立场。它的角色，不像古典风格的角色，不是平等个体之间的对等关系；它的典型场景不是对话；语言于思想的关系既不是为了呈现，也不是为了说服。「天才不仅在于能说服听众，且亦在于使人心荡神驰。」6 崇高的文章，或者在特定时刻表现出崇高风格的文章，与通过详细系统的论证达到说服目的的文章完全不同，因为在线性论证中，「独运匠心，善于章法，精于剪栽，不是在一两处可以觉察的，而须在全篇的发展中逐渐表现出来。但是一个崇高的思想，在恰到好处时出现，便宛若电光一闪，照彻长空，显出雄辩家的全部威力。」7

朗吉弩斯认为崇高风格的本质源于思想层面而非表面特征：「能形成令人振奋的思想」8 是崇高风格最首要、最有力的源泉。天然的表达能力当然是崇高风格必需的，但还不足以实现崇高风格。朗吉驾斯眼中的崇高风格源于作者与读者之间的完全不对等关系：作者天资聪颖，生来能说会道，令人羡慕，它的效果就是为了让我们心荡神驰，如果不用这种方式，我们可能领略不到。

尽管崇高风格作者和这种风格的学生之间的关系多么不对等，朗吉弩斯还是为学生提供了一种可能的课程，帮他们培养写出崇高风格的能力。该课程不是为了掌握或模仿某些表面模式，而是为了训练思想：

第一个因素，我指崇高的天赋，较其余的因素更为重要。虽然这是天生而非学来的能力，我们也要努力陶冶我们的性情，使之达到高远的意境，使之孕育着高尚的灵感。你问我，这有什么方法呢？我在别处写过这句话：「崇高的风格是一颗伟大心灵的回声。」所以，一个朴实无华的思想，即使不发于言，也往往仅凭它本身固有的崇高精神而使人赞叹… 所以，首先指出崇高的来源是绝对必要的，我们说，一个真正的演讲家绝不应有卑鄙龌龈的心灵。因为，一个终生墨守着狭隘的、奴从的思想和习惯的人，绝不可能说出令人击节称赞的、永垂不朽的言辞。是的，雄伟的风格是重大的思想之自然结果，崇高的谈吐往往出自胸襟旷达、志向远大的人。9

本着朗吉弩斯的精神，我们接下来会阐明古典风格在风格要素上采取的立场，并选取其他成熟一致的风格与古典风格对比分析。

#### 1.5.1 Classic Style Is Not Plain Style

Plain style is communal, its model scene a congregation in which speakers reaffirm for each other common truths that are the property of all. In the theology behind plain style, truth is always simple, and it is a common human possession. Individual revisions of this communal possession distort and dilute it. The wisdom of children can be the wisdom of adults, because knowing truth requires no special experience and no critical analysis. Sophisticated thought and conceptual refinement pervert truth. Any language that reaches beyond the simplest level is suspicious as the probable symptom of such a perversion. Simple language may not always be completely adequate to the expression of truth, but at least it is pure as far as it goes.

Classic style does not reject plain style, although it rejects the theology behind it and sees that theology as illegitimately elevating a necessary foundation into an achieved style. From the perspective of classic style, plain style is deficient because the theology behind plain style ignores the fact that, left to themselves, people are vulnerable to special interests and prone to special pleading. People are weak, and common wisdom is thus often self-serving. It is perfectly possible for common wisdom to be an anthology of a community's complacent errors, because common wisdom does not include any principle of critical validation. Without critical testing, common wisdom becomes received opinion.

Classic style views itself as repairing the deficiency of plain style by introducing sophistication and individual responsibility. First, classic writers and readers are an elite community, consisting of those who practice the critical discipline of its theology. Anyone can take up this practice and so join, but the style is aristocratic, not egalitarian. Second, classic wisdom cannot be the wisdom of children because it depends upon a wealth of adult experience. In plain style, everyone is equal; truth is everyone's birthright. It is seen by all; it is everyone's possession. It can come out of the mouths of babes. In classic style, truth is available to all who are willing to work to achieve it, but truth is certainly not commonly possessed by all and is no one's birthright. In the classic view, truth is the possession of individuals who have validated common wisdom; for them, truth has been achieved, and such achievement requires both experience and a critical intelligence beyond the range of babes.

Classic style remedies the deficiency of plain style by requiring the writer to stand entirely behind the thought she presents. Freshness is mandatory in classic style but freshness has nothing to do with novelty of ideas, on which classic style places no special premium. It is rather the requirement that the thinking behind the writing be the achievement of an individual. The classic writer has done the thinking, personally. Even when she accepts or uses a commonplace, she has thought it through herself and can stand behind it herself.

Classic style contains plain style concretely by incorporating it, but also by extending it, the way a Chinese ideogram contains a radical. A classic sentence is often a nuanced version of a sentence that otherwise might have been plain.「Grace is simple」is plain.「Grace, from the perspective of God, is simple」is classic, as is「The machinery of grace is always simple.」Plain style values simplicity but shuns nuance. Classic style values both simplicity and nuance.「The truth is pure and simple」is plain.「The truth is rarely pure, and never simple」is classic.「Seeing is believing」is plain.「Seeing is believing only if you don't see too clearly」is classic.

1.5.1 古典风格不是平实风格

平实风格是一种集体风格，它的典型场景是教堂会众彼此重申着人人共享的真相。平实风格背后的信仰认为，真相永远简单，是人类的公共财产。这种集体真相经过个体修改，只会被歪曲和削弱。小孩的智慧可以是大人的智慧，因为知道真相不需要特别经验，不需要批判性分析。复杂思考和概念提炼只会歪曲真相。凡不是最简单的语言，都可能被怀疑是这种歪曲的征兆。简单语言也许无法总是完全表达真相，但至少就其本身而言足够纯粹。

古典风格并不排斥平实风格，尽管它排斥平实风格背后的信仰，认为那种信仰把必要的风格基础误当作完善的风格。从古典风格的视角来看，平实风格存在缺陷，因为它背后的信仰忽视了一个事实：没有约束的人容易受特殊利益和一己私利迷惑。人是软弱的，因此群体智慧常常为己谋利。群体智慧很有可能只是一群人自以为是的错误集锦，因为群体智慧缺乏任何批判性验证原则。群体智慧还没有经过批判性检验就成了公认的观点。

古典风格用深思熟虑和个体责任补足了平实风格的缺陷。首先，古典风格的作者和读者是一个精英群体，他们的信仰要求他们批判性分析。任何人只要奉守这种信仰，都可以成为其中一员，但古典风格是贵族风格，而非平民风格。其次，古典智慧不可能只限于小孩智慧，因为它依靠丰富的成人经验。在平实风格中，人人平等；真相是每个人与生俱来的权利。每个人都能看到它；每个人都能拥有它。它可以从婴儿的口中说出来。在古典风格中，每一个愿意为真相努力的人都能获取真相，但真相肯定不是人人共享，也不是生来的权利。古典风格认为，真相属于检验过集体智慧的个人；对他们来说，付出努力才能获得真相，这种努力需要的经验和批判性头脑非婴儿能及。

为改进平实风格的缺陷，古典风格要求作者能充分佐证他呈现的思想。新颖是古典风格的强制要求，但新颖不是想法创新，古典风格不关注创新。它要求写作背后的想法是个体思考的结果，由古典风格作者自己独立思考得出。尽管他采纳或沿用了一个寻常观点，但他自己充分思考过，能亲自佐证它。

古典风格与平实风格有实际的包含关系，平实风格是古典风格的一部分，古典风格是平实风格的延伸，就像汉字包含某个偏旁部首。一个可能是平实风格的句子，稍做改动就可以成为古典风格。「优雅就是简单」是平实风格。「在上帝眼里，优雅就是简单」是古典风格，如「优雅的机制总是很简单」10 一样。平实风格注重简单，但忽视了细微变化。古典风格简单亦不失微妙。「真相纯粹且简单」是平实风格。「真相很少纯粹，也决不简单」是古典风格。「眼见为实」是平实风格。「眼见不一定为实，小心双眼被蒙蔽」是古典风格。

#### 1.5.2 Classic Style Is Not Reflexive Style

In the classic stand on presentation, writing is a perfectly transparent window through which a subject is presented; the ability of the writer and the sufficiency of the language to serve this presentation are never in doubt.

This fundamental stand opposes classic style irreconcilably to an entire family of styles in which the writing itself shares a focus with any other possible subject, and the difficulties of the writing are brought to the reader's attention.

Classic writing can present anything, but even when the subject presented is writing itself, the focus is not shared. La Bruyère talks about the conditions of good writing when he says,「It is necessary to express what is true in order to write naturally, powerfully, sensitively,」but he does not call attention to his own writing as he is doing so. When Alexander Pope criticizes bad verse in An Essay on Criticism, the writing itself imitates the faults he discusses, becoming a focus of the reader's attention:「And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line.」Classic style is a performance style, and while classic writers can be skeptical about anything else, they cannot be skeptical about their own ability to perform when they are in the act of performing. The classic writer assumes that his subject can be known and can be expressed without distortion. These are enabling conventions of the style. The classic writer is not necessarily free of doubts about his enterprise, but as a performer he must appear to be. An acrobat, a concert pianist, an actor cannot simultaneously perform and question the possibility of performing. Classic style is a style for performance, not a style for questioning its own competence.

When we open a cookbook, we completely put aside — and expect the author to put aside — the kind of question that leads to the heart of certain philosophic and religious traditions. Is it possible to talk about cooking? Do eggs really exist? Is food something about which knowledge is possible? Can anyone else ever tell us anything true about cooking? These questions may lead to enlightenment or to satori; they do not lead to satisfying dinners. Readers of cookbooks expect to see cooking treated directly, as if such metaphysical and epistemological questions could never be entertained by anyone, even though we know they can be and have been entertained by saints and sages. We do not expect the writer to be immobilized by preliminary discussions of whether it is possible to talk about「cooking,」if such a thing even exists. Classic style similarly puts aside as inappropriate philosophical questions about its enterprise. If it took those questions up, it could never get around to treating its subject, and its purpose is exclusively to treat its subject.

Raising skeptical doubts about the writer's own enterprise is a feature of nonclassic self-conscious styles. In such styles, the writer's chief, if unstated, concern is to escape being convicted of philosophical naïveté about his own enterprise. Such a writer is careful to gesture periodically toward the contingent frame of his own discourse, to disclaim any belief that his writing can treat any subject directly. The style stays in the foreground, inextricably mingled with its announced subject. It is marked with formulaic hedges concerning the possibility of knowledge, the contingency of knowledge, and the ability of language to express knowledge.「Impotence principles」such as the doctrine that discourse can never be about anything except itself share the focus of the writer's attention with any possible subject.

Classic prose does not discuss doubts or fears about its own enterprise, not because it is naïve, but because it has chosen something incompatible with reflexive inquiry. We can question the possibility of acting or we can act, but we cannot do both at once. Classic writers make an unspoken choice: they act. Rather than discuss the possibility of action, they put that possibility to the test, and let the reader be the judge.

Clifford Geertz, in Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author, quotes an example of such a self-referential and self-questioning style from the introduction,「Self and Other,」to Loring Danforth's The Death Rituals of Rural Greece:

Anthropology inevitably involves an encounter with the Other. All too often, however, the ethnographic distance that separates the reader of anthropological texts and the anthropologist himself from the Other is rigidly maintained and at times even artificially exaggerated. In many cases this distancing leads to an exclusive focus on the Other as primitive, bizarre, and exotic. The gap between a familiar「we」and an exotic「they」is a major obstacle to a meaningful understanding of the Other, an obstacle that can only be overcome through some form of participation in the world of the Other.

Geertz comments:

The brooding note of Loring Danforth's「Introduction」(Who am I to be saying these things, by what right, and to what purpose, and how on earth can I manage honestly to say them?) is one now very widely heard, in various forms and with various intensities.

Clifford Geertz, an acute observer of style, calls attention here to one mark of reflexive style. Reflexive styles might consider classic style to be naïve or philistine; but there is nothing naïve in a tacit acceptance of incongruities in the nature of writing and nothing philistine in making unhedged choices.

1.5.2 古典风格不是反思风格

古典风格的呈现立场是，写作是一面完全透明的窗户，事物透过这扇窗户呈现出来；毋庸置疑，作者有呈现的能力，语言可以充分表达这种呈现。

这种基本立场使古典风格与一组风格完全对立，这些风格的文章本身和可能谈论的任何主题一样惹人注意，写作的困难直接展示在读者面前。

古典文章可以呈现任何事物，但即使写作主题就是写作本身，也不会把读者的注意力吸引到写作过程上。拉布吕耶尔说「写作要想自然、有力、生动，必须表达出真相」时，谈的是好文章的条件，但他这样做时并没有让读者注意到他自己的写作。

亚历山大·蒲柏（Alexander Pope）在《论批评》（An Essay on Criticism）中批评坏诗时，模仿他批评的那种毛病，让读者注意到写作本身：「十字渐横移，一行常枯燥」（And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line）12。古典风格是一种表演风格，虽然古典风格作者可以怀疑任何其他事情，但唯独不能在表演的过程中怀凝自身的表演能力。古典风格作者假定他的主题可以被理解，可以不偏不倚地表达出来。这些是古典风格的基本规约。古典风格作者不一定对自己写的东西坚信不疑，但作为一名表演者，他必须表现成这样。杂技演员、钢琴演奏家、演员不可能一边表演一边质疑表演的可能性。古典风格是一种表演风格，而不是一种自我怀疑的风格。

当我们打开一本烹饪菜谱时，我们完全不会考虑 —— 也不认为作者会考虑 —— 那种涉及某些哲学和宗教传统的核心问题。烹饪能被谈论吗？鸡蛋真的存在吗？食物能用知识来解释吗？有谁能说出烹饪的任何真相吗？这些问题可能让人受到启发或顿悟，但无法教我们做出满意的餐食。看菜谱的人希望看到直接讲怎么烹饪，就好像没人会想到这种抽象的认识论问题一样，虽然我们知道圣人和智者会思考这些问题，也确实思考过。我们并不希望「烹饪」是否能被谈论这样的问题难住作者，使他无法动笔写，尽管这样的事情确实存在。同理，古典风格不会考虑不合时宜的哲学问题。如果讨论这些问题，文章可能无暇顾及它的主题，而它的目的只是论述它的主题。

自我意识强的非古典风格有个特点：作者会怀疑自己的写作内容。在这类风格中，即便未明言，作者最关心的是，如何避免被批评自己写的东西从哲学角度看太天真。这样的作者时不时慎重地声明他要说的话仅视特定情况而言，他的文章不可能考虑到所有问题。这种风格非常显眼，与它说的主题糅杂在一起。它的特点是，用很多迂回的套话说明认识的可能性、认识的偶然性及语言表达认识的能力。无论作者谈论的主题是什么，作者总要提及「无能原则」，比如言语不可能谈论其本身以外的任何事物。

古典文章不会讨论它对写作内容的疑惑或担忧，不是因为它天真，而是因为它选了不同于反思探究的立场。我们可以怀疑行动的可能性，或者我们也可以先行动起来，但我们不能已经行动了还怀疑行动的可能性。古典风格作者默认选择：行动。不是讨论行动的可能性，而是让这种可能性接受检验，让读者自己来判断。

克利福德·格尔茨在《论著与生活：作为作者的人类学家》（Words and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author）这本书中，举了自我参照和自我质疑风格的例子，例子引自洛林·丹福思（Loring Danforth）的《希腊乡村的死亡仪式》（The Death Rituals of Rural Greece）的序言「自我与他人」（Self and Other）：

人类学必然会涉及与其他人的交互。但人类学文章的作者及读者与其他人严格保持着种群距离，这种距离有时甚至被人为夸大。很多时候，这种疏远只会使人看到其他人原始、怪诞和外来的一面。熟悉的「我们」与外来的「他们」之间的隔阔，是深入理解其他人的主要障碍，要克服这种障碍，只有通过某种形式参与到其他人的世界里。

格尔茨评论道：

洛林·丹福思「引言」中这段沉思之语（我有什么资格说这些事情，有什么权利说，又为什么说，还有我到底怎样才能如实说出来？）是现在经常听到的一种风格，它们可以表现出不同的形式和强烈程度。13

克利福德·格尔茨对风格有敏锐的观察，这里指出了反思风格的一个特征。反思风格可能认为古典风格太天真或太庸俗。但是，默认写作本身的矛盾性并非天真，直截了当地表达也并非庸俗。

#### 1.5.3 Classic Style Is Not Practical Style

In the model scene behind practical style, the reader has a problem to solve, a decision to make, a ruling to hand down, an inquiry to conduct, a machine to design or repair — in short, a job to do. The reader's need, not the writer's desire to articulate something, initiates the writing. The writer's job is to serve the reader's immediate need by delivering timely materials. The motive can thus be almost anything productive of a need: greed, enterprise, competition, philanthropy. Since the reader is engaged in solving a problem, the reading is not an end in itself, it is instrumental to some other end. That is why, in this scene, the prime stylistic virtue is ease of parsing. In practical style, the best presentation will allow the reader to acquire timely information with a minimum of distraction because, in this scene, writing is an instrument for delivering information with maximum efficiency and in such a way as to place the smallest possible burden upon the reader, who has other — more important — burdens to bear.

In classic style, by contrast, neither writer nor reader has a job, the writing and reading do not serve a practical goal, and the writer has all the time in the world to present her subject as something interesting for its own sake. Her characteristic brevity comes from the elegance of her mind, never from pressures of time or employment. The writing is initiated by the writer, not the reader: the writer wants to present something not to a client, but to an indefinite audience, treated as if it were a single individual. Her motive is to present truth, not so that someone can use it to accomplish a practical goal, although someone might make use of it for such a purpose, but for its own sake.

Classic style and practical style have important areas of overlap; both styles place a high value on clarity and directness. Classic style values clarity because it sees itself as a transparent medium for the presentation of truth. Practical style values clarity because it places a premium on being easy to parse. Both styles can be described as precise and efficient, but for quite different reasons: practical style is precise and efficient because the reader wants to understand well and quickly for the purpose of making immediate use of what he is reading; classic style is precise and efficient because precision serves truth and because efficiency is a refinement. The efficiency of classic style is a sign of its having the leisure and luxury to afford refinement: the writer and reader have had all the time needed to train their minds to the requisite concert pitch.

Neither classic style nor practical style contains much of the sort of internal network of cross-references that linguists call「metadiscourse」(「I would like to tell you about X but first I have to tell you about y」). In classic style, such explicit acknowledgment of planning defeats the immediacy and spontaneity that mark the style's model scene, conversation. In practical style, a network of cross-references, clotting the text, is a poor substitute for less distracting indications of coherence.

There are a few recognizable prototypes of the model scene of practical style. The first, drawn from the world of corporate business or the legal profession, is a memorandum to a superior who has asked for information. The writer knows more about the subject than the reader, but it is the reader who will make a decision or take action, and so stands in need of some of the writer's knowledge. The reader's need is the motive for writing. A second prototype is a memorandum to a subordinate whose activities the superior is trying to direct and manage. In neither case does the reader want or expect to know everything the writer knows about the subject. Practical style is selective in a way that classic style is not. The cast is hierarchical, not symmetric. Clustered around these prototypes are recognizable extensions: the manual telling someone how to perform routine jobs; the manual telling someone how to use something; the how-to book instructing the CEO in the art of negotiation; the book about financial planning telling those with discretionary income how to invest it; the advisory from a manufacturer to owners of the manufactured product telling them that it has a defect and how to get it fixed.

Another prototype of this scene is the delivery of the results of research to fellow researchers, which is to say, fellow insiders. The writer knows more about his own research than the readers do, but they are fellow professionals who expect to know everything he knows as a result of reading his report, or know at least what they need to know for their own purposes. What is reported will affect their own independent activities in ways that they alone can judge. The writer is imparting information and does not want his writing, as such, to be noticed; it should fulfill every standard expectation and be as easy to parse as possible.

Most writing in schools and colleges is a perversion of practical style: the student pretends that he is writing a memorandum. He pretends that he knows more than the reader, that the reader needs this information, and that his job is to impart that information in a way that is easy for the reader to parse. This pretense is supposed to be practice for the real thing. Actually, the reader (the teacher) probably knows much more about the subject than the writer; the reader (the teacher) has no need whatever for the information; and the job of the writer is to cover himself from attack by his superior (the teacher). The actual scene interferes so much with the fantasy scene that the result is almost inevitably compromised, if not fraudulent.

The best-known teachers of practical style are Strunk and White, in their ubiquitous Elements of Style. The best teachers of practical style are Joseph Williams and Gregory Colomb, in Williams's Style: Toward Clarity and Grace and a series of academic articles and technical reports.

Strunk and White's disarming treatment of what everybody really needs to know about writing has been treasured by generations of people who are occasionally forced to write something and view the prospect with a sinking feeling of dread. As a guide to writing, The Elements of Style, being little more than an apparently arbitrary mixture of grammatical digest, handy list of common mistakes, and expert hand-holding, is drastically incomplete, but it is a masterpiece of psychological insight. Its attractions derive, we suspect, first, from its implicit, cheery, and optimistic promise that if you just read its few pages and work those few surface tricks it teaches you (「In summaries, keep to one tense,」「less should not be used for fewer」), you will not embarrass yourself; second, from its exhortatory cheerleading that seems so assured and upbeat; and third, from its tone of common sense that masks, at key points, an essential vacuousness:「Choose a suitable design and hold to it.」

Such advice has the same immemorial power of「Just use your head, and you'll be all right.」Advice of this sort has the great merit of being brief and supportive. There is a welcome assurance that there is really nothing to it, except for those truly mysterious aspects of the subject that cannot be taught at all.「I can teach you where to put a comma in ten minutes, but don't expect me to teach you to write like Shakespeare.」

Williams and Colomb present an incomparably deeper and more orderly treatment of practical style. The style they present is consistent and mature; it makes decisions about all the major questions that define a style, and is fully developed. The claim behind Williams and Colomb's treatment is large and theoretical: just as readers of an English sentence have expectations about word order and the distribution of information in a sentence, so readers of what Williams and Colomb call「pointed texts」have in their minds a grammar of such texts that tells them where to look for what. Readers will use that grammar. Writing that conforms to it will be easy for the reader to follow. Writing that resists it will be difficult for the reader to follow. For example, a reader looks for an opening section (「the issue」) and a following section (「the discussion」) within each unit of a pointed text. He looks for a rich lexical field, at the end of the issue, which will be used to weave the discussion together, to give it cohesion, as it progresses. He looks for a point at the end of the discussion. If there is a point at the end of the issue, it will be taken to be an adumbration of the point at the end of the discussion. Units of discourse nest, so that units within the discussion will themselves be composed of an issue and a discussion. These principles work themselves down to the level of the sentence, where the reader expects the first part of the sentence to present an issue (topic) and the second part of the sentence to present a discussion (comment). The reader expects old information in the sentence before new. The reader prefers to understand things in terms of actions and agents, so the backbone of a sentence should be a verb that conveys action, and the subject of such a verb should be one of the agents — perhaps metaphorical — in this action-story. Since readers link agents to actions in pairs, writers should try not to separate the subject (agent) from the verb (action) with distracting information. And so on.

Williams and Colomb's finely detailed treatment of practical style provides an indispensable guide impressive in its scope and intelligence. It is missing just one thing, namely, an explicit acknowledgment of its fundamental stand, and an acknowledgment that its fundamental stand is one of many alternatives. While their work is thorough, systematic, and theoretically sophisticated, and while they know that they are dealing with just one style, the work is misleading in its self-presentation: it pretends that the style it concerns, and about which it gives excellent advice, is universal and exclusive rather than merely ubiquitous. Practical style rests on a set of answers to basic questions; other styles rest on different answers to those same questions.

Practical style comes from deciding that what matters in style is the reader, and in particular the reader's ease in parsing features of the text, especially the discourse features of the text. Practical style is so firm in this decision that it treats it as no decision at all, but as a necessity: of course excellence of style consists in conforming to the reader's grammatical expectations in the act of reading. Why else would anyone presume to take up a reader's time than to solve a problem for the reader? Why then would anyone write except to inform the reader about a solution to that problem? How else can this be done aside from ordering the text so that readers can get the point before giving up in the face of the obvious difficulty? Williams and Colomb accordingly coach their students in a style of writing assimilated to a model of reading.

Classic style makes similar pretenses in adopting the rather different stand that the writer counts equally with the reader, that both are fully engaged by the subject, competent, and alert, that of course the reader will be interested in what the writer has to say, and that of course the reader will recognize truth once it has been clearly presented.

In the model scene of practical style, readers and writers hold standard job slots in existing institutions. The reader has no leisure and does not want surprises; the reader reads not for personal reasons but to accomplish a job. Accomplishing the job depends upon the communication of information, and practical style serves the purpose of keeping the information flowing efficiently through institutions. Since students will go on to such employment, they must be trained to write in practical style. The writer is not an individual writing to another individual but a job description writing to another job description. There is a job to do and practical style is the appropriate tool for doing it: the style is thus fundamentally optimistic, pragmatic, and utilitarian. The motive is the job; eternal and noncontingent truth is irrelevant except as it bears upon the performance of the job — even then its eternal and noncontingent nature is beside the point.

There is a surface mark of practical style as presented by Williams and Colomb that derives from its fundamental stand and distinguishes it sharply from classic style. If the reader always expects to find certain kinds of things in certain「discourse locations,」and the writer submits uniformly to those expectations, then the style permits skimming, because the cream is always in the same place. This can be highly useful in certain practical situations: if you are sitting at a desk and need to plow through forty-three memos, most of whose substance you already know, it will be a great help if you can rely upon the memos to present their main points in the expected places; then you can simply glance through and extract what you want.

If you try to skim classic writing in this way, you run the risk of missing indispensable conceptual nuances or refinements. In the model scene of classic style, the classic reader is not pressed for time, distracted by jobs to do, or mired in routine. The classic reader is competent, sophisticated, quite able to handle surprises, and unimpressed with predictability. The surface mark of classic style that is most uncongenial to practical style can be picked out by what we will call the「last-third」test: once you have progressed a little way into a piece of writing, block out the last third of each sentence as you come to it, and imagine the standard things you might expect to occupy that position, based on what you have already read. If what in fact does occupy that position is routinely one of those standard and expected things, then the piece may be a paragon of practical writing but is unlikely to be classic. This is not because classic sentences reverse themselves at the end: once you see the end of a classic sentence, you will recognize that the sentence was true to its direction, but that does not make the sentence predictable, because it usually contains a conceptual refinement that is clear and simple as the truth but not a cliché and hence not predictable. Here are four passages that pass the last-third test beautifully; none of them is likely to occur in practical style:

Although a dirty campaign was widely predicted, for the most part the politicians contented themselves with insults and lies. (Julian Barnes on the 1992 British parliamentary elections)

With peer pressure and whippings at school and at home, we were soon completely socialized and as happy as children anywhere. (Ruth Baer Lambach)

In the same year [1827] the United Kingdom, Russia and France decided to intervene to enforce an armistice「without however taking any part in the hostilities.」The allied fleet went to parley with the Turkish fleet anchored in Navarino Bay (Pylos) and ended up destroying it. (Greece [Michelin Green Guide])

It is from this weighing of delights against their cost that the student eater (particularly if he is a student at the University of Paris) erects the scale of values that will serve him until he dies or has to reside in the Middle West for a long period. (A. J. Liebling)

1.5.3 古典风格不是实用风格

在实用风格背后的典型场景中，读者需要解决一个问题，做出一个决定，宣布一项裁决结果，开展一项调查，设计或修理一台机器 —— 总之有一项任务要做。激发写作动力的是读者的需要，而不是作者的表达欲望。作者的任务是及时提供资料，满足读者的迫切需求。因此几乎任何能激发需求的东西都可以成为写作动机：贪婪、上进、竞争、慈善。因为读者要解决问题，所以阅读本身不是目的，它只是为了帮助实现其他目的。这就是为什么在这种场景中主要的风格特点是易于解读。在实用风格中，最好的呈现是让读者在尽可能少的干扰下及时获取信息，在这种场景中，写作是一种高效传达信息的工具，这样才能尽可能减少读者的负担，因为他们有其他更重要的任务要承担。

相反，在古典风格中，作者和读者都没有任务在身，写作和阅读不是为了实现某个实用目的，而作者有足够充分的时间呈现他的主题的趣味，因为它本来就有趣。古典风格作者的用语特点是简练，但简练是因为思想优雅，绝不是时间或雇主所迫。写作的动机是作者要写，而不是读者要看：作者不是写给某个客户看，而是写给不确定的读者看，这些读者在作者眼里就好像是一个个独立的个体。他的动机是呈现真相，而不是为了方便某人实现某个实用目的，虽然人们可能把它用于这样的目的，但也是为了真相本身。

古典风格和实用风格在很多重要地方有共同点：两种风格都注重清晰直接。古典风格清晰，是因为它把自己看作一种呈现真相的透明媒介。实用风格清晰，是因为它注重句子容易解读。两种风格都可以用准确和高效来形容，但原因大不相同：实用风格准确高效，是因为读者为了立即用上所读内容而需要快速准确地理解；古典风格准确高效，是因为准确服务于真相，高效源于精炼。古典风格高效，说明它有足够的闲暇和兴致锤炼思想：作者和读者均有充分的时间，把他们的思想校准到必要的高效能状态（concert Pitch）。

古典风格和实用风格不会在同一写作环境内交织很多互相参照的内容，即语言学家说的「元话语」（metadiscourse）（讲到 X 之前，我要先说说 Y。在古典风格中，这么直白地承认事先谋划，会破环它的典型场景所特有的那种即兴感。在实用风格中，各种相互参照使文本不通畅，干扰注意力，是逻辑不够连贯的表现。

实用风格的典型场景有一些常见的原型。第一种，常见于企业商圈和法律界，是一种按上级要求的信息写的备忘录。作者比读者更了解主题，但做决定或采取行动的是读者，所以需要作者提供某些知识。读者的需求是作者写作的动机。第二种原型是上级要指导和管理下属活动时写给下属的备忘录。这两类场合的读者不想了解也没打算了解作者知道的所有主题信息。实用风格有选择地呈现，古典风格不会。实用风格的角色有层级之分，并非对等。这些原型延伸出很多其他常见类型：日常工作指导手册，物品使用指南，CEO 谈判艺术入门指南，理财规划之自由支配收入投资指南，工业制造品常见故障维修手册。

这种场景的另一个原型是面向同行研究员即业内人士发布研究成果。作者比读者更了解自己的研究，但他们这些同行专家想阅读他的报告，了解他掌握的所有信息，或至少他们为各自目的需要掌握的内容。报告的内容将影响他们各自独立的活动，但他们自己可以辨别这种影响。作者传达信息，并不想读者关注他的写作本身；它应该在每个标准位置提供读者需要的信息，并且尽可能容易解读。

大部分大学及院校的写作误用了实用风格：学生假装他在写备忘录。他假装他懂的比读者多，所以读者需要这些信息，而他的任务是用一种方便读者解读的方式传达信息。这种假装本来是对真实场景的练习。实际上，读者（老师）很可能远比作者了解主题，读者（老师）根本用不上这些信息，而作者的任务是掩护自己不被上级（老师）挑错。

实际场景对理想场景造成很大的干扰，这样写出来的东西，如果算不上作假，那也几乎不可避免会大打折扣。

实用风格最知名的老师是斯特伦克和怀特，他们写过畅销书《风格的要素》。实用风格最好的老师是约瑟夫·威廉斯和格雷戈里·科伦，他们写过《风格：清晰、优雅地写作》及一系列学术论文和技术报告。

斯特伦克和怀特提出的每个人真正需要掌握的写作知识，对那些有时不得不写但又特别担心自己写不出来的人来说是一种宽慰，一直以来深受几代人的追捧。《风格的要素》作为一本写作指导书非常不全面，很明显只不过是随机汇总了精编语法知识点、常见错误实用清单和专家解读，但这是一本心理洞察的杰作。我们觉得它之所以吸引人有三个原因：

其一，它向读者透露出某种积极乐观的承诺：只要你读上几页并用对它教你的那几个表面技巧（「概述时，自始至终使用同一种时态」「不要把形容可数名词的比较级 fewer 误用为形容不可数名词的比较级 less」），你就不会让自己难堪；其二，人们对它的认可和支持看起来如此坚定和满怀期待；其三，一些关键位置的内容本来空洞贫乏，用一种常识的口吻讲述后倒显得必不可少了：「文章的格局一经选定，千万不能偏离。」

这种建议就跟说「只要你动脑，就不会出错」一样，有一种古老的力量。这种类型的建议的优势是，简洁且鼓舞人心。它的自信令人心安：除了那些完全不可能教授的神秘之处外，它真没什么诀窍。「我可以用十分钟教你在哪里打逗号，但不要想着我把你教成莎士比亚。」

威廉斯和科伦论述实用风格的方式更深刻、更有条理。他们呈现的是一种成熟一致的风格；他们的风格对定义风格的重大问题做出了决定，是一种发展完善的风格。威廉斯和科伦论述背后的主张范围广、理论强：正如读者阅读某个英文句子，会预判一句话的词序排列和信息分布，读者阅读威廉斯和科伦说的「观点文本」（pointed texts）时，心里依据的是一种在什么位置找什么信息的语法。读者会使用那种语法。文章用了这种语法后很容易读懂，不用这种语法就很难读懂。

比如，读者可以在一篇观点文本的每个单元找出开头段落（议题）和后续段落（讨论）。在议题的结尾，他可以找出丰富的词汇场（lexical field），这部分会整合讨论内容，把每一步有序地串联起来。在讨论的结尾，他可以找出问题点。如果议题结尾提出了问题，那么讨论的结尾会给出这个问题的概述。话语单元交织成句，所以构成讨论的单元本身也由议题和讨论构成。句子层面也遵循同样的原则，读者预判句子第一部分是议题（话题），第二部分是讨论（评论）。读者预判句子先说已知信息，然后再讲新信息。读者倾向根据行动和执行者理解事情，因此句子主干应该是一个表达行动的动词，这个动词的主语应该是一个执行者 —— 或许用一种比喻说法 —— 是某组行动故事（action-story）中的一个执行者。因为读者把执行者和行动看成一组关联内容，作者应该尽量避免用干扰信息隔断主语（执行者）和动词（行动）。诸如此类还有很多。

威廉斯和科伦对实用风格翔实细致的论述，不仅涉及范围广，而且思想深邃，提供了一份必要的指导。美中不足的一个地方是，没有明确承认它的基本立场，以及承认它的基本立场只是众多立场中的一种。虽然他们的作品论述翔实、体系完整、理论成熟，虽然作者知道他们只是论述一种风格，但作品在自我呈现方面误导了读者：它对它讨论的风格提出的建议很精彩，但它假装这种风格可以普遍适用且仅此一种，不只是应用广泛。实用风格基于对一组基本问题的回答；对这组问题的回答不同，则形成的风格也不同。

形成实用风格的最基本立场是，风格中最重要的是读者，主要是读者能轻松分析出文本特征，特别是文本的语言特征。实用风格非常坚信这一点，它觉得这不是一项决定，而是一种必然：优秀风格所用语法当然要符合读者阅读时的预期。为什么有人要占用读者的时间而不是解决他的问题？为什么有人要写问题解决方案之外的东西？除了把文本组织得易读些，避免读者遇到难懂的直接放弃，还可以怎么做？因此，威廉斯和科伦给他们的学生训练的写作风格内化了某种阅读模式。

古典风格做了类似的假定，但采取的立场有些不同：读者重要，作者也同等重要；双方都很关注这个话题，胜任且专注；作者说的话读者当然感兴趣；一旦清晰地呈现，读者当然会看出来。

在实用风格的典型场景中，读者与作者要根据现有的惯例完成标准任务。读者没有闲心，也不想读出什么惊喜；读者不是为了个人原因阅读，而是为了完成任务。完成任务的前提是信息交流，而实用风格就是遵循惯例确保信息高效流通。因为学生要从事这样的工作，必须训练他们的实用风格写作。作者不是作为个体向另一个个体写作，而是用一项工作描述回应另一项工作描述。对于一项任务来说，实用风格是最合适的工具：因此实用风格的基本上是乐观、实用和功利的。动机是完成任务：如不是跟完成任务相关，永恒和必然的真相无关紧要 —— 即使有关，真相永恒和必然的特点也不是最重要的。

如威廉斯和科伦指出，实用风格有个表面特征源于它的基本立场，使之与古典风格明显不同。如果读者总是期待在某些「语篇位置」找到某种东西，作者也完全迎合这些期待，那么这种风格可以略读，因为要点总是在同一个地方。在某些实用场合这很好用：如果你要坐在位子上看一份长达四十三页的备忘录，大部分内容你都熟悉，这时候如果备忘录都把要点放在预期位置上，会省不少事；这样你只用迅速扫几眼就能提取你想要的信息。

如果你用这种方式略读古典文章，你可能会忽视一些重要思想的微妙或精要之处。在古典风格的典型场景中，古典风格读者不会觉得时间紧迫，也不会分心想着没完成的任务，或陷入套话中。古典风格读者可以胜任，思想成熟，能够应对意料之外的内容，不要求文章可预测。古典风格与实用风格最不同的表面特征，可以用一个测试看出来，我们称为「最后三分之一」（last-third）测试：文章读了一部分后，看后面的每句话都先遮住最后三分之一的部分，根据你读完的部分猜想遮住部分可能的标准内容，如果那个部分实际表达的内容总是和预期的标准内容一致，那这篇文章可能是典型的实用写作，但不可能是古典风格。这不是说古典句子在句未否定了自己：在古典风格中，当你看一句话的结尾，你会看到句子方向一致，但这不代表可以预测句子，因为它常常包含精炼的思想，它和真相一样清晰简单，但不是陈词溢调，因此不可预测。下面四段话均顺利通过最后三分之一的测试，它们不可能出现在实用风格中。

虽然很多人预料这是一场不公平的选举活动，但总的来说政治家们对侮辱和谎言都感到满意。（朱利安·巴恩斯 1992 年英国议会选举）14

既有来自同辈的压力，又有学校和家庭的鞭策，我们很快就完全适应社交生活，在任何地方都像孩子一样快乐（露丝·贝尔·兰巴赫）15

#### 1.5.4 Classic Style Is Not Contemplative Style

Classic style implicitly defines itself as a normal, practically inevitable, perspective. It makes continual if tacit claims to transparency; it does not interpret; it merely presents. These claims are, of course, false. When the style succeeds, it simply obscures the distinction and manages to pass off interpretation as presentation.

In contemplative style, the distinction between presentation and interpretation is always observed: the writer sees something, presents it to the reader, and then interprets it. The stress is on the interpretation, but the transition is always explicitly marked. E. B. White, a master of the contemplative essay, characteristically observes this sequence, as he does in「The Ring of Time,」a dazzling piece of writing that is entirely unclassic. White describes himself casually observing a practice session of a circus, watching the lion tamer, a big, brown horse, and then a circus rider. He tells the reader precisely what he sees and how he sees it:「As she emerged in front of us, I saw that she was barefoot, her dirty little feet fighting the uneven ground. In most respects she was like any of two or three dozen showgirls you encounter if you wander about the winter quarters of Mr. John Ringling North's circus, in Sarasota — cleverly proportioned, deeply browned by the sun, dusty, eager, and almost naked.」White describes what he sees and what anyone there with him might see. And then he contemplates what he sees and offers an interpretation:「I became painfully conscious of the element of time. Everything in the hideous old building seemed to take the shape of a circle, conforming to the course of the horse. The rider's gaze, as she peered straight ahead, seemed to be circular, as though bent by force of circumstance; then time itself began running in circles, and so the beginning was where the end was, and the two were the same, and one thing ran into the next and time went round and around and got nowhere.」He then sees that the girl is deluded:「She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.」The associations, the connections, the very way he turns a commonplace event into an allegory of time belong to him alone; contemplative style assumes that this is not what someone standing next to him would see. In contemplative style, the focus is on the interpretation and not on the event.

White stands in a tradition of American preachers who present a text and then interpret it. The common scene that White sees becomes, through his contemplation of it, an allegory of the world, which the reader is allowed to see because White offers his superior vision. He begins to discuss things that in principle the reader has no way of checking, and he does not hesitate to refer to himself as something like an authority.「The circus comes as close to being the world in microcosm as anything I know; in a way, it puts all the rest of show business in the shade. Its magic is universal and complex. Out of its wild disorder comes order; from its rank smell rises the good aroma of courage and daring; out of its preliminary shabbiness comes the final splendor.」The asymmetry between writer and reader is profound. White takes the attitude that the reader could be perfectly competent and yet, in looking at this scene, see none of what he sees.

The first fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style is thus that classic style presents something but contemplative style presents an interpretation of something. This entails many different decisions concerning truth, presentation, cast, and scene.

The second fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style has to do with thought and language. Classic language is an instrument for presenting the product of thought according to the order of reason, not according to the sequence of experience. In contemplative style, writing is itself the engine of discovery: the writing is a record of the process of the writer's thinking, quite independent of its relation to the order of reason. In contemplative style, the touchstone of the writing is the process of the writer's contemplation. That process and the writer's engagement in it often become an explicit subject of the writing:

In attempting to recapture this mild spectacle, I am merely acting as recording secretary for one of the oldest of societies — the society of those who, at one time or another, have surrendered, without even a show of resistance, to the bedazzlement of a circus rider. As a writing man, or secretary, I have always felt charged with the safekeeping of all unexpected items of worldly or unworldly enchantment, as though I might be held personally responsible if even a small one were to be lost. . . . The ten-minute ride the girl took achieved — as far as I was concerned, who wasn't looking for it, and quite unbeknownst to her, who wasn't even striving for it — the thing that is sought by performers everywhere. . . . As I watched with the others, our jaws adroop, our eyes alight, I became painfully conscious of the element of time. . . . i thought:「She will never be as beautiful as this again」 — a thought that made me acutely unhappy — and in a flash my mind (which is too much of a busybody to suit me) had projected her twenty-five years ahead.

Rather than presenting truth, White often quotes his own contemplation, giving its history:

「She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.」. . . And then I slipped back into my trance, and time was circular again — time, pausing quietly with the rest of us, so as not to disturb the balance of a performer.

In these passages, White uses many of the surface marks of clarity, precision, and accurate vocabulary that are associated with classic style. But his fundamental stand on the elements of style is very far from the classic stand. Regardless of language or phrasing, none of these passages could fit comfortably in a classic text.

Because contemplation is a superior achievement by a superior individual who talks about the difficulties of contemplation, contemplative style splits into two modes that are not incompatible and that can be used alternately. Sometimes, the contemplative writer succeeds fully in his achievement: thought and language can be adequate. Thoreau frequently writes as if he has been successful in his contemplations. But sometimes, the contemplative writer fails in his achievement, and feels compelled to settle for what is merely his best effort. White often does this, as when he writes,「But it is not easy to communicate anything of this nature.」

At other moments, White seems to take the extreme stand that language is always inadequate to the task:「It has been ambitious and plucky of me to attempt to describe what is indescribable, and I have failed, as I knew i would. But I have discharged my duty to my society; and besides, a writer, like an acrobat, must occasionally try a stunt that is too much for him.」

1.5.4 古典风格不是沉思风格

古典风格默认自己是一种普通但又很难避开的视角。虽未明示，但它一直主张透明；它不解释，它只是呈现。这些说法当然不对。成功的古典风格表达只是弱化两者的差别，把解释表现为呈现。

在沉思风格中，可以看到呈现与解释的界限：作者看到什么，就呈现给读者，再对它解释说明。重点在解释上，但过渡有明显的标记。E. B. 怀特擅用沉思风格写作，常用到这种过渡顺序，他写的《时光之环》正是如此，文风绚烂，但完全不是古典风格。怀特描述他自己偶然观看的一场马戏团训练，有驯狮员、一匹棕色大马和一名马戏团骑手。他确切地告诉读者他看到了什么和怎么看到的：「等她出现在我们面前，我见她赤着双脚，邋遢的小脚丫在坑坑洼洼的地面上趔趄。从许多方面看，她与你在萨拉索塔县约翰·林林先生北方马戏团冬季营地可能碰到的二三十个小丫头没什么两样，身材匀称，皮肤给阳光晒成棕色，邋遏，热切，几乎是赤身裸体。」① 18 怀特描述他看到的画面，任何和他一起在那儿的人都能看到这个画面。他这样思考和解释他的所见：「我与他人一道观望，下颌低垂，眼晴闪亮，一边痛苦地意识到时光的因素。这老旧的庞大建筑中的一切，似乎都呈现圆环形状，与奔马的线路契合。骑手凝视前方，她的目光似乎也是环形的，好像是在环境的压力下弯曲：接着，时光本身也开始循环运动，终结处是起始，二者再无区别，一件事融入下一件事，时光如斯，一圈又一圈地流逝，没个了结。」接着他又看到女孩如何陷入错觉中：《我想）当她相信她能绕着圆环，做出二个完整的圆圈，她在终点时的年纪正是她在起点时的年纪，她处在一种令人美慕的生命时刻。」这种联想，这种连接，这种把一件平常事物变成时间讽喻的方式，只属于怀特自己；沉思风格认为，这不是站在他的位置就能看到的东西。在沉思风格中，解释比事物本身更重要。

怀特遵循的是一种美国传教士的传统，先陈述一段话，然后对它进行解释。怀特本来看到的是普通场景，经过一番沉思后，变成了对世界的讽喻故事，读者能看到只是因为怀特提供了他自己的优越视角。他开始讨论的事情原则上是读者无法验证的，他又毫不犹豫地把自己称作某种权威。「据我所知，没有什么，比马戏团更像一个世界的缩影，在某种程度上，它使所有演艺团体都相形见绌。它的神奇力量既普遍又复杂。它在混乱中见出秩序，粗鄙中见出勇气和胆魄，乍看之下的浅陋中见出最终的辉煌。」作者与读者明显不对等。怀特的态度是，读者可以完全胜任，只是这个场景只有他看得到，读者看不到。

因此古典风格和沉思风格之间的第一个根本区别是：古典风格呈现事物，而沉思风格呈现对事物的解释。这引发二者在真相、呈现、角色和场景上的许多不同决定。

古典风格与沉思风格之间的第二个根本区别与思想和语言有关。古典语言是一种呈现思想产物的工具，这种呈现依据的是推理顺序，而不是体验顺序。在沉思风格中，写作本身是发现的引擎：写作是对作者思考过程的记录，完全独立于它与推理顺序的关系。在沉思风格中，作者的思素过程是衡量作品好坏的标准。文章呈现的鲜明主题常常是那种思索过程和作者参与其中的体验：

我在这里再现这一舒缓的场景，不过是为一个最古老的群落充当书记员，这个群落中人，曾经在某个时候，甚至不做一点抗拒，等闲就迷上了一位马戏团的骑手。身为作家，或书记员，我始终觉得有义务记录下所有世俗的或非世俗的奇闻逸事，仿佛有一点遗漏也难免给人追究责任…...女孩儿这十分钟的驱驰 —— 就我而言，我并没有期待这些，她也并不知道我在场，而她，甚至也不是有意为之 —— 但这十分钟，却进入了任何地方任何舞台上的演艺者都在追求的境界…...我想：「她绝不会再像此刻这样美丽了。」—— 如此一个念头让我深感惆怅 —— 我的思想（这般活跃让我难以招架）一下子投射到二十五年后。

怀特不是呈现真相，而是经常引用自己的沉思，赋予它历史：

「她正当让人艳美的美妙年华（我想），以为她可以绕行一周，成就一个完整的圆，最后恰恰回到开始的年龄。」…...不知不觉中，我又进入了出神的状态，时间再度循环一时间，在我们这里停顿了，免得打扰表演者的平衡。

怀特写的这些段落清晰、准确、用词恰当，这些都是跟古典风格相关的表面特征。但他在风格元素上的基本立场完全偏离古典立场。不管用什么语言和什么措辞，上面任何一段话都无法融入古典文本中。

因为沉思是优越的个体谈论沉思之难时思索出来的东西，因此沉思风格分为两种模式，二者互不排斥，也可以交替使用。有时，沉思风格的作者能完全呈现他的思想：思想深邃，语言充分。梭罗写的东西看起来往往完整表达了自己所想。但有时，沉思风格的作者无法传达自己的思想，虽不尽如人意，但已尽力而为。怀特经常这样做，就像他写道：

「可是表达这种性质的东西不太容易。」

其他时候，怀特似乎采取一种极端的立场，认为语言总是无法胜任表达：「一些事情，本来难以形诸笔墨，我偏要描述，未免不自量力，而我果然失败了，我已经料到。但我履行了对社会的义务，此外，身为作家，就像杂技演员，必须勉为其难地尝试些新花样。」

#### 1.5.5 Classic Style Is Not Romantic Style

Contemplative style is fundamentally about the writer's thought and often explicitly acknowledges this focus. Romantic style, although not necessarily focused on the writer's thought in the sense of his analysis or reflection, is always and inescapably about the writer. Romantic prose is a mirror, not a window.

Romantic style does not separate thought from sensation, memory, and emotion. All these things together are experience. Neither does romantic style distinguish the person who experiences from the experience. The romantic writer therefore cannot be an observer who sees something separate from himself; both the writer and his experience are inseparable elements of a perpetual dialectic in which the writer creates a world, which in its turn creates him. This process is something like the pulse of life. A writer can describe this dynamic relationship, but cannot「present」it and allow it to be verified.

If contemplative style views writing as an engine of discovery, romantic style looks upon it as an act of creation that both comes from the self and reveals the self.

The narrator of Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu offers a striking description of such an act of romantic creation in his account of his first direct encounter with the Duchesse de Guermantes, a woman who had a large place in his imagination before he had ever seen her. The image he cherished has little to do with her — no one but the narrator himself could validate it in a face-to-face encounter with her — but it reveals a great deal about the narrator:

My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a stained-glass window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race.

At this point, there is a kind of struggle between the classic outlook and the romantic.

. . . I was endeavouring to apply . . . to this fresh and unchanging image, the idea:「It's Mme de Guermantes」; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes with a space between.

The Madame de Guermantes whose existence is independent of the narrator's idea of her does not, however, overcome the Madame de Guermantes who is a defining element of his mentality. He says these words to himself silently but distinctly:

「Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Geneviève de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.」

His struggle ends with a creative act that allows the narrator to see the romantic truth, one unique to himself, one that could not be shared by anyone else present on the occasion he describes.

. . . my eyes resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch:「How lovely she is! What true nobility! It is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant, that I have before me!」

In contemplative style, which preserves a distinction between observation and the observer's reflections, it is possible to discover something that is outside of the self and not dependent on the writer for its existence. In romantic style, which observes no such distinction, creation replaces discovery and always depends on the writer for its existence.

Classic writing may present personal material as an instance of a more general truth, but it never presents something that is merely personal or in principle private. For romantic style to rule out personal experience or even experience that is in principle private would reduce the romantic writer to silence. In the theology of this style, the only things anyone can know are personal and in principle private.

Classic style never leaves the writer feeling incomplete, unfulfilled, or incompetent. Classic writers can know something, and once they know it, they can say it. Correction and revision are not infinite, because classic style is a craft that can effectively be learned by learning its parts, none of which is idiosyncratic. Thought and language fit, so it is possible to succeed completely in expressing truth. In romantic style, to separate thought and expression or thought and thinker as separate and fixed realities is to make a false division that leads to false conclusions. In the romantic perspective, writing is not a craft that can be learned, because it is an activity co-extensive with the writer's person; it cannot be reduced to discrete modules, separate writing jobs that can be completed one after another. There is no complete fit between thought and language because a writer's thought is not a formed and fixed reality independent of language and capable of being fitted into it.

It is a premise of classic style that truth has been perfectly perceived by the writer. The writer's problem is to articulate that truth perfectly, and in the theology of classic style this problem always has a solution. In romantic style, the writer can know truth romantically and whole, but truth cannot be conceived analytically without a loss of definition, and cannot be put into language without a further loss of definition. In classic style, truth is allied with clarity. In romantic style, clarity can be achieved only at the price of falsification.

Both the classic writer and the romantic writer are vulnerable but in entirely different ways. The classic writer is vulnerable because he speaks noncontingent truth to which everybody is vulnerable. The romantic writer is vulnerable because everybody is vulnerable to the conditions of life. The classic writer is always vulnerable to challenge; the romantic writer never. When the romantic writer says he dreams of Jeanie with the light brown hair, he yearns for her, he sighs for her, who can check to see whether it is true? He cannot be told he is wrong, for he stands in a special place, with incorrigible knowledge about his entirely private and personal subject matter. If he is wrong, his error is built into the human condition, so no human being can correct him. But the classic writer can be told that he is wrong, because the truth he presents is available to everyone, and can be tested by anyone.

Of the styles we have discussed, classic and romantic are furthest apart: they take strong fundamentally irreconcilable stands on every one of the elements of style. The distinction between them is as absolute as the distinction Demetrius saw between the restrained and the elevated. The classic stand on the elements of style is not always opposed in all particulars to the stands of other styles. Between classic style and practical style is an agreement that language is sufficient to express knowable truths. Between classic style and contemplative style is at least a channel for discussion: at least sometimes, truth can be known and language can express it. Between classic style and plain style is a gradient of conceptual refinement. But classic style and romantic style represent irreconcilable conceptual stands. There is no common ground between them, no gradient from one to the other; instead there is something like a permanent and impassable divide.

1.5.5 古典风格不是浪漫风格

沉思风格认为最重要的是作者的沉思，通常也大大方方承认这一点。浪漫风格的关注点虽然不一定是作者的分析或思考，却总是避不开作者。浪漫风格的文章是一面镜子，而非一扇窗户。

浪漫风格的思想离不开感受、记忆和情绪。这些东西共同形成体验。在浪漫风格中，体验本身和体验的人息息相关。因此浪漫风格作者看到的事物无法脱离自身而存在；作者和他的体验是一对不可分割的持续辩证因素：作者创造了一个世界，反过来这个世界又创造了他。这个过程仿佛生命的律动。作者可以描述这种动态关系，但无法「呈现」它，也无法被读者验证。

如果沉思风格把写作视为发现的引擎，浪漫风格则把它看作一种创造行为，两者都源于自身，又揭示自身。

在普鲁斯特《追忆似水年华》这本书中，叙述者讲述的一次初遇，完美诠释了这种浪漫的创造行为，他初遇的是一位未曾谋面就已令他魂牵梦绕的盖尔芒特公爵夫人。他心里珍藏的形象与她本人毫无关系 —— 只有叙述者本人与她面对面相遇才可能验证 —— 但这透露了很多与叙述者相关的信息。

我失望得很。失望在于我万万没有预料到她会是这样的：过去一想到盖尔芒特夫人，我总是用挂毯或彩色玻璃窗的色调在心中描绘她的形象，把她想象成另一世纪的模样，举止气派与活生生的人完全不同。① 19

① 汉译文出自李恒基译《追忆似水年华》第一部第一卷「贡布雷」，本书其他《追忆似水年华》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

在这点上，古典视角和浪漫视角彼此对立。

…...我努力…...给这个全新的、不可改变的形象粘贴上如下的说明：「这位就是德-盖尔芒特夫人。」然而我却不能使这样的认识同形象妥帖地相合，它们像两只隔着空档的圆盘，始终转不到一起。

真实存在的盖尔芒特夫人独立于叙述者的思想，然而并没有动摇他想象出来的盖尔芒特夫人。他心里的自言自语如此清晰：

盖尔芒特家早在查理大帝之前就声名显赫，对手下的属臣拥有生杀之权：盖尔芒特夫人是热纳为耶夫-德-布拉邦特的后代。她不认识、也不想认识这里的任何人。

他最后用一种创造性的行为抚慰这种挣扎，叙述者可以由此看到浪漫的真相，但只有他自己看得到，别的任何人处在他所描述的场合都无法看到。

…...我的日光注视她的金黄色的头发，她的蓝眼晴和她的脖子，由此排除了可能使我想到别人容貌的一切特征，看着这幅有意画得不完全的速写稿，我不禁叫出声来：「她多美呀！多雍容华贵！她准是盖尔芒特家的一位高做的夫人，热纳维耶夫德-布拉邦特的后代！」

在沉思风格中，作者会区分他的观察和思考，所以可能发现自身之外且不依附于作者而存在事物。浪漫风格没有这种区分，创造取代了发现，且往往依附于作者而存在。

古典写作可以把个人化的东西呈现出更普遍的真相，但它不会呈现纯粹个人化的或原则上私密的东西。浪漫风格作者如果不写个人体验或甚至说得上私密的体验，他就没有什么可说的了。这种风格秉持的信仰是，人只能知道个人化或原则上私密的东西。

古典风格从来不会让作者感觉有什么不完全、未实现或不胜任的地方。古典风格作者可以知道一些事情，一旦他们知道，他们就能把它表达出来。不会没完没了地纠正和改善，因为古典风格是一种可以通过分块学习提高效率的技艺，没有哪个部分是个人特有的。思想和语言能相互匹配，所以完全可能表达真相。在浪漫风格中，把思想和表达或者把思想和思考者分成独立而确定的现实，这种错误的划分方式只会带来错误的结论。在浪漫风格看来，写作不是学出来的技艺，因为它是一种与作者本人共生的活动；它无法简化成独立的模块，一步步完成写作任务。思想和语言不可能完全匹配，因为作者的思想不是成型且确定的现实，不能独立于语言，也没有合适的语言可以表达。

作者已经完全洞察到真相是古典风格的前提条件。作者的问题是如何完美地表达那个真相，而在古典风格的信仰中，这个问题总有解决办法。在浪漫风格中，作者可以用一种浪漫的方式了解完整的真相，但用一种分析眼光看待的真相不可能不失真，用语言表达出来必然也会进一步失真。在古典风格中，不清晰无真相。在浪漫风格中，清晰的代价是不真实。

古典风格作者和浪漫风格作者都是脆弱的，但他们是两种不同的脆弱。古典风格作者脆弱是因为他说的是人人都可以看到的必然真相。浪漫风格作者脆弱是因为每个人的生活状况各有不同。古典风格作者总是经受检验；浪漫风格作者从来都不会。当浪漫风格作者说他梦见了珍妮和她浅棕色的头发，为她感怀，为她叹息，谁能验证它的真假？你不能跟他说他错了，因为他站在一个特殊位置，他的主题内容是完全私人和个人化的东西，只有他个人知道。如果他错了，他的错误是人本身的局限所致，因此没有人可以纠正他。但古典风格作者错了可以被人们纠正，因为他呈现的真相任何人都能看到和检验。

我们前面讨论的风格中，与古典风格相差最大的是浪漫风格：它们对每种风格要素采取的立场鲜明对立。两者的殊别就像德米特里眼中的矜持风格和庄严风格，完全不能兼容。对风格元素的立场，古典风格并非总是与其他风格完全对立。古典风格和实用风格都认为语言能够表达可知的真相。古典风格与沉思风格之间至少有一定程度的相通之处：至少某些时候，真相能被人们知道，语言也能表达真相。古典风格与平实风格是一种由浅及深的概念提炼。但古典风格与浪漫风格的概念立场完全对立。两者没有共同基础，也不是由浅及深的递进关系；相反，彼此之间似乎有某种永远无法跨越的鸿沟。

#### 1.5.6 Classic Style Is Not Prophetic Style

Despite a shared affinity for unqualified assertion, classic style has little in common with prophetic or oracular style because prophetic style cannot place the reader where the writer is. The reader cannot verify through his own experience what the writer experiences. Classic style does not depend upon powers that are divine or that are available only to special people, or powers whose availability is subject to some agency that human beings do not control or understand. Prophetic style, on the other hand, depends entirely upon such powers. The ability of the prophetic writer to know truth has come through powers that are not part of the usual human complement. Even their possessor does not possess them reliably: these powers come and go in ways that he does not understand or control.

In Western culture, the best-known examples of prophetic style are in the Old Testament. When the sons of Jesse come before Samuel, the eldest, Eliab, makes an immediate impression on the aging judge, who concludes,「Here, before the Lord, is his anointed king.」It is a response that stands for human insight and wisdom; it is the judgment of a wise and experienced person. Any reader who knows what Samuel knows would presumably share his view of Eliab. But in the model scene of the prophetic style, human judgment does not and cannot share the sacred perspective, even though it can, through a privileged channel, receive the fruit of divine wisdom. The Lord responds to Samuel:「Take no account of it if he is handsome and tall; I reject him. The Lord does not see as man sees; men judge by appearances but the Lord judges by the heart.」

One of the most famous representations of the model scene of prophetic style occurs in the opening chapter of the Book of Jeremiah. The passage begins with the archetypical claim of the prophetic writer, that he is not speaking in his own voice and not conveying his own judgments.「The Word of the Lord came to me.」It then passes on to a dialogue between the Word of God and the inarticulate Jeremiah.

「Before I formed you in the womb . . . I appointed you a prophet to the nations.」

「Ah! Lord God,」I answered,「I do not know how to speak; I am only a child.」. . . Then the Lord stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and said to me,「I put my words into your mouth. This day I give you authority over nations and over kingdoms, to pull down and to uproot, to destroy and to demolish, to build and to plant.」

The equally famous representation of the calling of Isaiah establishes the same points although they run the risk of being lost in the fabulous vision in which they are embedded. The prophet inexplicably finds himself in the realm of the divine, where he does not belong. (「Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips. . . .」) But his deficiency is miraculously removed and「unclean lips」are made capable of speaking divine words. He volunteers his services as a messenger and receives his commission:「Go and tell this people. . . .」

The poet, painter, engraver, and printer William Blake is one of the few widely admired modern writers to make extensive use of prophetic style in something like its prototypical form. But prophetic style is not confined to the sacred literature of ancient Israel or an occasional genius-crackpot like Blake. It has its modern form on all those occasions in which a writer claims to be a channel for impersonal and normally inaccessible truth. The writer makes claims to authority, but not his own authority and not the kind of authority that is available to others.「History tells us」(and, tacitly,「I am history's spokesman」) is a common anthem of politicians and of those mysterious channels of wisdom who write opinion columns in newspapers; prophetic style is used by jurists who on occasion claim to speak the judgment of principles or of long-dead foundation jurists; it is the style of all those innumerable spokesmen who tell us what「tradition,」「common sense,」or「common decency」demand and of those slightly less numerous spokesmen who tell us what fashions state or what eras or epochs tell us.

1.5.6 古典风格不是先知风格

古典风格与先知风格或者说神谕风格都要求绝对的肯定，尽管如此，两者几乎没有共同的地方，因为先知风格无法把读者放到作者所在的位置。作者体验的东西，读者无法通过自己的体验验证。古典风格依靠的不是神的力量，或非凡之人才能获得的力量，或非人类所能控制、非人类所能理解的力量。而先知风格完全取决于这些力量。先知风格作者能掌握真相，借助的是非常人能及的力量。甚至他获得了力量，也不代表就能长期拥有它们：这些力量怎么到他身上又怎么消失的，他自己都不理解，也不能控制。

在西方文化中，先知风格最著名的例子是《（圣经〉旧约》（Old Testament）。当耶西的儿子们来到撒母耳面前，大儿子以利押给年迈的审判官留下了直接印象，他断言道：「这就是他，你起来膏他。」① 20 这是一个代表人类洞见与智慧的回答；这是一个聪明老练之人的判断。任何读者如果知道撒母耳所知道的，可能会对以利押有同样看法。但是，在先知风格的典型场景中，人类的判断不会出现也不可能出现这种神圣的视角，虽然可以通过某种特许渠道接收神圣智慧的果实。耶和华对撒母耳说：「不要看他的外貌和他身材高大，我不拣选他。因为耶和华不像人看人，人是看外貌，耶和华是看内心。」21

① 汉译文出自「现代标点和合本」（CUVMP Simplified），本书其他《圣经》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

最能代表先知风格典型场景的著名文本之一是《耶利米书》（The Book of Jeremiah）的开篇章节。文章开头采用了先知风格作者的典型口吻，他不是用自己的声音说话，也不是表达自己的见解。「耶和华的话临到我说。」22 然后转到耶和华与不善言辞的耶利米之间的谈话：

我未将你造在腹中…... 我已派你做列国的先知。

我就说：「主耶和华啊！我不知怎样说，因为我是年幼的。」...… 于是耶和华伸手按我的口，对我说，「我已将当说的话传给你。看哪，我今日立你在列邦列国之上，为要施行拔出、拆毁、毁坏、倾覆，又要建立、栽植。」

以赛亚使命也是典型的先知风格场景，证实了相同的观点，尽管这些观点通过传说中的神示表达出来可能难以理解。先知莫名地发现自己在一个神圣领地，他不属于的地方。（「祸哉，我灭亡了。因为我是嘴唇不洁的人」22）但他的缺陷奇迹般地消除了，「不洁的嘴唇」也能说出圣洁的话。他自告奋勇担任信使服务百姓，并接受对他的委托：「你去告诉这百姓说…...」。

广泛使用类似典型形式表达先知风格的现代作家屈指可数，身兼诗人、画家、雕刻家与版画家的威廉·布菜克（William Blake）是其中少数几个被众口称赞的作家之一。但先知风格不限于古代以色列的神圣文学，也不专属于布菜克这样少见的天才怪人。它有现代的表现形式，常见于一些自称是客观真相的传播者的作者，知道一般人无法知道的真相。作者拥有权威，但这权威不是自己，也非常人可及。政治家和那些以神秘的智慧传达者身份写报纸评论专栏的作家，总喜欢说「历史告诉我们」（或「我是历史的发言人」）；法学家有时也会用先知风格声明审判的依据源于某些准则或某位已故的法学奠基人；还有数不清的代言人用这种风格告诉我们怎么样做才符合「传统」「常识」或「基本礼仪」，也有不少代言人用这种风格告诉我们时尚是什么，或者时代或年代的启示是什么。

#### 1.5.7 Classic Style Is Not Oratorical Style

The central model for most discussions of rhetoric in classical antiquity seems to be oratory. Even when something is written — rather than spoken — in an oratorical style and meant to be read silently by one individual, its effects are meant for the ear. The text may be written down formally in sentences, but its units are periods and are defined by sound.

The model scene of oratorical style is neither casual nor spontaneous. Its prototypical occasion is the assembly of a group of people faced by a public problem — like military invasion, the forming and maintenance of public values, or the judging of social offenders.

This scene creates a cast. Leadership is necessary, and the assembly's job is to respond to a candidate who puts himself forward. The orator assumes a role as leader of both the public moment and the setting of policy. He invites the audience to yield to his rhythms and to his views, which he typically presents as a version of common verities. The audience may coalesce and perhaps join in as his chorus, or remain splintered and perhaps heckle him randomly. The successful orator molds the audience into one body with one voice and one governing view. To the outsider, he may appear to be alternatively a demagogue with an echo or the selfless conductor of the common music.

In a slight variant of this model scene and cast, the audience has as its head a judge or perhaps a king who rules on policy under advice from the full audience. When Odysseus debates with Akhilleus over the best time for the Akhaians to engage the Trojans on the field of war, the judge is High King Agamemnon, but the entire council is the audience with Agamemnon at its head. Akhilleus, who wants to avenge immediately the slaying of Patroclos, vents his anger and represents his singularity:

Let us recover joy of battle soon, that's all!

No need to dither here and lose our time,

our great work still undone. When each man sees

Akhilleus in a charge, crumpling the ranks

of Trojans with his bronze-shod spear, let each

remember that is the way to fight his man!

Odysseus, by far the better orator, isolates Akhilleus by assuming for himself the role of defender and spokesman of the audience, thereby making it natural for the audience to identify with him and his views:

Brave as you are, and like a god in looks,

Akhilleus, do not send Akhaian soldiers

into the fight unfed! Today's mêlée

will not be brief, when rank meets rank, and heaven

breathes fighting spirit into both contenders.

No, tell all troops who are near the ships to take

roast meat and wine, for heart and staying power.

No soldier can fight hand to hand, in hunger,

all day long until the sun goes down!

Though in his heart he yearns for war, his legs

go slack before he knows it: thirst and famine

search him out, and his knees fail as he moves.

But that man stayed with victualing and wine

can fight his enemies all day: his heart

is bold and happy in his chest, his legs

hold out until both sides break off the battle!

Come, then, dismiss the ranks to make their breakfast.

Since oratory is designed to unite many listeners, whose attention may flag, it cannot be either very flexible or very subtle. Nuance is always risky with such an audience. Consequently, the surface of oratory usually looks like a few points with the help of a lot of music. Going along with the music helps the audience go along with the points, as Kenneth Burke has remarked in A Rhetoric of Motives:

[W]e know that many purely formal patterns can readily awaken an attitude of collaborative expectancy in us. For instance, imagine a passage built about a set of oppositions (「we do this, but they on the other hand do that; we stay here; but they go there; we look up, but they look down,」etc.) Once you grasp the trend of the form, it invites participation regardless of the subject matter. Formally, you will find yourself swinging along with the succession of antitheses, even though you may not agree with the proposition that is being presented in this form. Or it may even be an opponent's proposition which you resent — yet for the duration of the statement itself you might「help him out」to the extent of yielding to the formal development, surrendering to its symmetry as such. Of course, the more violent your original resistance to the proposition, the weaker will be your degree of「surrender」by「collaborating」with the form. But in cases where a decision is still to be reached, a yielding to the form prepares for assent to the matter identified with it. Thus, you are drawn to the form, not in your capacity as a partisan, but because of some「universal」appeal in it. And this attitude of assent may then be transferred to the matter which happens to be associated with the form.

Burke, in writing this passage, surely had in mind Pericles' Funeral Oration, as reconstructed by Thucydides, in which Pericles attempts to guide the Athenians at a difficult historical moment in their sense of communal values by offering them an image of themselves that just happens coincidentally to serve Pericles' own purposes. In this oration, which takes place at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles follows the model of Odysseus in the debate with Akhilleus. Like Odysseus, Pericles casts himself in the role of spokesman for the audience. His oration has as its most central and famous parts a series of explicit and implicit contrasts between the Athenians and citizens of rival cities:

Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it: the real shame is not taking practical measures to escape from it. Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the state as well. . . . We are capable at the same time of taking risks and of estimating them beforehand. Others are brave out of ignorance; and, when they stop to think, they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.

Later, after the plague and the second invasion of Athenian land by the Peloponnesians, the Athenians grow angry at Pericles. To defuse their anger, he summons them to Assembly and revives the oratorical theme of the previous Funeral Oration:

No doubt all this will be disparaged by people who are politically apathetic; but those who, like us, prefer a life of action will try to imitate us, and, if they fail to secure what we have secured, they will envy us. All who have taken it upon themselves to rule over others have incurred hatred and unpopularity for a time; but if one has a great aim to pursue, this burden of envy must be accepted, and it is wise to accept it. Hatred does not last for long; but the brilliance of the present is the glory of the future stored up for ever in the memory of man. It is for you. . . . Do not send embassies to Sparta: do not give the impression that you are bowed down under your present sufferings! To face calamity with a mind as unclouded as may be, and quickly to react against it — that, in a city and in an individual, is real strength.

The contrasts between oratorical style and classic style can be illustrated right from this text of Thucydides. He comments on Pericles' oratory in a style whose impulses served as a prototype for the inventors of classic style:

In this way Pericles attempted to stop the Athenians from being angry with him and to guide their thoughts in a direction away from their immediate sufferings. So far as public policy was concerned, they accepted his argument, sending no more embassies to Sparta and showing an increased energy in carrying on the war; yet as private individuals they still felt the weight of their misfortunes. The mass of the people had had little enough to start with and had now been deprived of even that; the richer classes had lost their fine estates with their rich and well-equipped houses in the country, and, which was the worst thing of all, they were at war instead of living in peace. In fact, the general ill feeling against Pericles persisted, and was not satisfied until they had condemned him to pay a fine. Not long afterwards, however, as is the way with crowds, they re-elected him to the generalship and put all their affairs into his hands. By that time people felt their own private sufferings rather less acutely and, so far as the general needs of the state were concerned, they regarded Pericles as the best man they had. . . . He survived the outbreak of war by two years and six months, and after his death his foresight with regard to the war became even more evident. For Pericles had said that Athens would be victorious if she bided her time and took care of her navy, if she avoided trying to add to the empire during the course of the war, and if she did nothing to risk the safety of the city itself. But his successors did the exact opposite, and in other matters which apparently had no connection with the war private ambition and private profit led to policies which were bad both for the Athenians themselves and for their allies.

The roles adopted by Pericles the orator and Thucydides the classic writer differ sharply. Pericles leads a group but Thucydides merely presents something to the reader. Pericles is interested but Thucydides disinterested. Pericles is the conductor of the rhythm of the crowd but Thucydides is merely talking in his natural voice. Pericles wants something from his audience but Thucydides does not. Pericles asserts and advises but Thucydides merely observes. Pericles is formal, Thucydides casual. Pericles speaks in a public occasion but Thucydides is telling the reader something spontaneously. Pericles affirms common wisdom, but Thucydides operates at all moments as an independent thinker. Pericles expects his audience to notice his oratory while Thucydides pretends that his prose is transparent. Pericles asks his audience to look harder to see what needs seeing, while Thucydides is simply pointing out something that is obvious once presented. Of course, in fact, Thucydides' supposed historical account is a relentless argument about the nature of crowds and democracies, but he presents his conclusions the same way one might point out the first turning of the leaves in fall, as a fact, although a subtle fact. It is a characteristic strength of classic style to persuade by default. The classic writer offers no explicit argument at all. Ostensibly, he offers simply a presentation. If the reader fails to recognize that the ostensible presentation is a device of persuasion, then he is persuaded without ever realizing that an argument has occurred. It is always easier to persuade an audience unaware of the rhetorician's agenda.

The differences between the oratorical and classic models of speech are considerable because oratory and the writing styles based on it have a lot of practical work to do. These oratorical styles cannot concern themselves with thought exclusively or even mainly. They have not merely to keep an audience made up of many individuals attentive and alert but also to take a heterogeneous group of individuals and mold them into a unified body directed at action or the making of policy for action. They make use of what the audience already thinks much more than they introduce new observations or refine old ones.

1.5.7 古典风格不是演说风格

古典时期大部分修辞论述的主要模式是演说。如果一篇文章写成演说风格，尽管是书面表达 —— 不是口头演说 —— 且读者只是一个人默读，也是为了产生震撼耳朵的乐感。文本的句子可能写得很正式，但它的单元都是乐句，而且由声音定义。

演说风格的典型场景既不是非正式的，也不是即兴的。它的典型场合是一群人因为面临某个公共问题聚集在一起 —— 如军事入侵，树立和维护公共价值观，判决社会罪犯等。

这个场景创造了一种角色。领导人必不可少，而群体的任务是响应主动站出来的候选人。演说者担任的是领导人角色，他既是现场公众的领导者，也是制定政策的领导者。他邀请听众响应他的节奏和主张，通常他会把这种主张表现成某种大家共有的信念。听众可能联合起来，也许加入响应他的队伍或者独立出来，也许还会随意冲他起哄。成功的演说者把听众联合成一个整体，只有同一种声音，同一种信念。在外人的眼中，他可能看起来像一位煽动民情的政客，又或者是演奏同一首音乐的无私指挥家。

这种典型场景与角色可以稍做改变，听众的领导者是一名法官，或者也许是一位国王，他要根据全体听众的意见决定政策。当奥德修斯（Odysseus）与阿喀琉斯（Akhilleus）对阿喀琉斯进攻特洛伊的最佳时机争论不休时，法官是至高的阿伽门农王（High King Agamemnon），但整个委员会是阿伽门农领导的听众。阿喀琉斯恨不得立即为死去的帕特罗克洛斯（Patroclos）复仇，他满腔愤怒，表现得与众不同：

现在我们应该考虑

出战的事情，不能在这里空发议论，

把时间耽误：伟大的事情还未完成。

让大家看见阿喀琉斯重新参战，

挥舞铜枪无情地杀戮特洛亚军队，愿你们每个人也这样勇猛地杀戮敌人。① 23

奥德修斯在演说上技高一筹，通过扮演守卫者和听众代言人的角色孤立阿喀琉斯，听众则自然而然地认同他和他的主张。他说：

「神样的阿喀琉斯，不管你如何勇敢，

也不能让未早餐的阿开奥斯人去伊利昂

同特洛伊人厮杀，因为战斗不可能

短时间结束，当双方的战线开始接触，

神明向交战双方灌输同样的力量。

还是首先让阿开奥斯人快到船边

用点酒饭，酒饭会给人勇气和力量。

一个人不可能空着肚子整天不断地

同敌人作战，一直杀到太阳下山。

即使他心中很想顽强地坚持战斗，

但他的肢节会突然疲软，饥饿和焦渴

一同袭来，抬动两腿会觉得力乏。

如果一个人喝够了酒，吃饱了饭，

他便能够同敌人整天连续厮杀，胸中的心力勇猛不衰，全身肢节坚韧不乏，最后一个停止作战。

你现在应该解散军队，让他们用餐。」23

因为演讲的目的是把听众团结起来，避免他们注意力涣散，所以演讲不宜过多变化，也不宜过于晦涩。不宜向这类听众阐述太多细节。因此，表面上看起来演说通常是少数观点附和着大量音乐。跟随音乐的节奏，有助于听众认同演讲者的观点，正如肯尼斯·伯克（Kenneth Burke）在《动机修辞学）(A Rhetoric of Motives）中写道：

我们知道，许多纯粹形式上的模式，容易唤起我们内在的预期合作态度。例如，想象一篇文章一系列对立的句子（「我们做这个，但他们做那个；我们待在这里，但他们去那里；我们向上看，但他们向下看。」等等）。一旦你理解了这种形式趋势，无论主题是什么，它都会吸引你参与进来。你会发现自己沉浸在一种连续的对比形式中，即使你可能不认同通过这种形式提出的主张。或者它甚至可能是你不喜欢的反对者提出的主张一然而因为叙述本身的持续性，你可能为了「帮他摆脱困境」，会逐渐认同这种形式上的递进，屈服于它的这类对称形式。当然，起初你对这种主张反抗越强烈，你就越不愿意「屈服」，越不会与这种形式「合作」。但是在决定还未达成的时候，对形式的屈服会使人们逐渐认同与之密切相关的内容。所以，你被形式吸引，不是因为你是虔诚的信徒，而是因为它内在的一些「普遍」吸引力。这种认同的态度，可能会迁移到和形式相关的内容上。24

伯克在写这段话时，脑子里想的一定是修昔底德修编的《伯里克利的葬礼演说》（Pericles'Funeral Oration），伯里克利试图用这场演说引导危在旦夕的雅典人民理解公共价值观，于是为他们描绘了他们自身的一种形象，这种形象又恰恰有利于伯里克利实现自己的目的。这篇演说发生在伯罗奔尼撒战争第一年的年末，当时的伯里克利效仿了奥德修斯与阿喀琉斯辩论的模式。像奥德修斯一样，伯里克利扮演了听众的代言人。在他的演说中，最重要最著名的部分是对雅典人民与敌城人民所做的一系列明确又含蓄的对比：

我们热爱美的事物但不至于奢侈，热爱智慧但不至于柔弱。我们把财富当作是可以适当利用的东西，而不是当作可以夸耀的东西，真正的耻辱不是贫穷这一事实本身，而是不千方百计地去摆脱贫穷。我们的公职人员，在关注公共事务的同时，还关注自己的私人事务… 我们在从事冒险事业之前或冒险事业之中，能够做到既敢于冒险，又深思熟虑。其他人的勇敢，是由于他们的无知，当他们反思的时候，又会感到疑惧了。但是，真正勇敢的人无疑应属于那些最清醒地认识人生的灾患和幸福而又勇往直前，在危难面前从不退缩的人。① 25

① 汉译文出自徐松岩翻译版本，本书其他《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

后来，随着瘟疫爆发和伯罗奔尼撒人第二次入侵雅典土地，雅典人开始怨恨伯里克利。为了平息他们的愤怒，他把民众召集到一起，延续先前的「葬礼演说」主题：

那些没有雄心壮志的人会对这些光荣提出非难，但是那些积极行动的人会努力仿效我们，如果他们没有我们这样幸运的话，他们会忌妒我们的。所有渴望统治别人的人，都会暂时招致别人的仇恨，会不得人心的。但是追求最崇高的目标的人必然招致憎恨，因此而招致憎恨的人是真正聪明的人。招致憎恨也是暂时的，但是由此而产生的目前的显耀和将来的光荣会使人们永世难忘的。因此，你们…...不要派使者前往拉栖代梦，不要表露出任何一点这样的迹象，表明你们在目前的灾祸面前低头了。因为只有那些在心态上最冷静对待灾难的人们，只有那些在行动上最快速解除灾难的人们，才是最杰出的人、最伟大的公民集体。25

修昔底德下面这段话可以说明演说风格和古典风格的差异。他评论伯里克利演说所用的风格的动力，为发明古典风格的人提供了原型：

这就是伯里克利试图平息雅典人对他的怒气，引导他们从思想上摆脱现在的痛苦所列举的论据。他们作为一个公民集体被伯里克利成功地说服了，他们不仅不再考虑派使者去拉栖代梦和谈，同时还对战争投入更大的力量。但作为个人，他们在灾难面前还是不堪重负的。普通民众原来仅有的那一点点财产，如今也被剥夺了，上层阶级丧失了他们在乡村的美丽的田园和设施优良、富丽堂皇的房舍：最糟糕的是他们生活在战争中，而不是在和平中。事实上，对伯里克利的恶感还是普遍存在，直到他们判处伯里克利缴纳一笔罚款。可是，不久以后，按照民众办事的一贯方式，他们又选举他为将军，把他们的一切事务都交给他处理，现在，他们对于个人的和家庭的灾难的感受没有那么强烈了，以邦国公共需要而论，他们认为伯里克利是所有的人当中最有才能的人。因为在和平时期，只要他担任城邦的首脑，他就追求一种温和的、稳健的政策，他执政的时代正是雅典的全盛时代。战争爆发的时候，他似乎也准确估计了雅典的军事实力。战争开始后的两年半他才去世。他去世以后，他对战争的某些正确的预见更加为人所知。伯里克利告诫雅典人说，如果雅典静待时机，关注自己的海军，不再去征服新的领土，并且在战争中不使雅典城发生危险的话，他预计雅典是会赢得这场战争的。但是，雅典人的行动却恰恰相反，在一些显然与战争毫不相千的事务上，个人野心和私人利益导致了一些对雅典人自已和他们的同盟者都不利的政策。

伯里克利是演说家，修昔底德是古典作家，两个人的角色完全不同。伯里克利领导一群人，而修昔底德只是向读者呈现事情。伯里克利有利可图，而修昔底德无私可谋。伯里克利指挥着群众的节奏，而修昔底德只是用他自然的语调说话。伯里克利对听众有所期待，而修昔底德没有。伯里克利总是断言和建议，而修昔底德只是观察。伯里克利是正式讲话，而修昔底德只是闲谈。伯里克利是在公众场合演讲，而修昔底德只是即兴告诉读者某件事。伯里克利宣扬共同智慧，而修昔底德在任何时候都是一名独立的思考者。伯里克利希望他的听众注意他的雄辩言辞，而修昔底德假装他的文章透明无形。伯里克利要求他的听众努力看需要看的东西，而修昔底德只是指出一旦呈现出来就显而易见的事物。当然，事实上，修昔底德所谓的历史叙述，是对群众与民主的性质的有力论证，但他呈现结论的方式，犹如人们可以指出秋天的叶子第一次转变颜色，虽然这是一个不易察觉的事实。不知不觉中说服他人是古典风格特有的优势。古典风格作者没有明显论证什么。表面上看，他只是呈现而已。如果读者没看出这种假托的呈现是一种说服手段，那他还没意识到有论证时就被说服了。避免听众察觉到修辞家的意图，则更容易说服听众。

演说风格和古典风格的说话方式完全不同，因为这种风格的演讲和写作有很多实际工作要做。这些演说风格不会只专注思想，甚至也不会把思想放在第一位。演说风格不仅要维持这许许多多个人组成的听众的注意力，还要带领这些各色各样的人团结一致，引导他们行动或为行动制定政策。这些风格更多的是利用听众已有的想法，而不是引入新观点或升华旧观点。

### 1.6 Trade Secrets

Classic writers almost never discuss the classic stand on the elements of style, not because they want to keep secrets but rather because they take the classic stand to be obvious, needing neither explanation nor justification. But they have no axiomatic prejudice against investigating the classic stand, and there are classic works, such as Descartes's Discourse on Method, that explicitly lay out many of the principles behind it.

These principles constitute what we have called the theology behind the classic stand. The theology is acknowledged even if rarely discussed. But separate from the theology are a few trade secrets, acknowledged neither in the theology nor in the style. The theology can be learned by anyone, but only a classic writer is likely to come to an understanding of how the trade secrets of the style are related to its theology. There are two principal trade secrets: classic style's practical limitations and the ultimate incoherence of its theoretical perspective.

1.6 古典风格的秘密

古典风格作家几乎从不讨论古典风格在风格元素上的立场，不是因为他们要隐藏什么，而是因为他们认为古典立场显而易见，不用解释也无须辩护。但他们不反对进一步考证古典立场，而且有些古典作品，比如笛卡儿的《谈谈方法》，清晰地阐述过古典立场背后的诸多原则。

这些原则构成了我们所说的古典立场背后的信仰。虽然很少讨论，但这种信仰是被认可的。但有些秘密不属于这种信仰，既不被这种信仰认可也不受古典风格认可。人人可以学到这种信仰，但只有古典风格作者才可能理解这种风格的秘密与它的信仰之间的关系。古典风格有两大秘密：古典风格有限的应用范围和无法实现终极统一的理论视角。

#### 1.6.1 Classic Style Is Inadequate

There are theorems in mathematics — such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, and Wedderburn's Theorem (「A finite division ring is a field」) — that count as high art because of their elegance and purity. Their proofs move deftly and efficiently in clear and irrefutable steps through vast, seemingly incomprehensible landscapes of overwhelming complexity and detail, to bring out at a snap a crisp and powerful truth that is obvious once it is pointed out. As the absolute brilliance of the truth comes into focus, an absolute inevitability, completeness, and perfection accompany it, as if these proofs are not inventions of formal steps but rather the perfect discovery of the clear and simple truth they present. No one would have seen the truth without having seen it presented this way, but once seen, it is seen entirely and recognized absolutely. This is the stereotype of a mathematical proof: brief, efficient, clear, elegant, and pure. Classic style takes such elegance to be not merely normative but universal.

But there are problems in mathematics, like the four-color problem or the traveling salesman problem, that have been treated in a manner that is neither elegant nor pure. They are battles of attrition. The four-color problem, for example, was first solved by a computer program that spent night after night testing possibilities and ruling each out. The conception of this proof is of course extremely clever, but the proof itself, printed out, looks like what it is: the mechanical application of brute force. It is impossible to follow this proof, and no one could keep it all in mind. There is no clear and simple truth for anyone to see. The traveling salesman problem is still susceptible only to approximations and heuristics, again computer-assisted and very untidy. Many of the best mathematical minds of the last three centuries have sought an exact efficient solution to this and related problems, without success, leading to the current suspicion that there is no exact efficient solution. Worse, it is now widely suspected that there is not even an efficient approximate solution. If there is no efficient solution at all, the only approach to these problems is to work at this or that special case, and to leave off short of finality and perfection.

Mathematics acknowledges this situation and has invented many instruments, such as numerical methods, that do not fit the stereotype of brief, simple, and elegant proof. Classic style, on the other hand, acknowledges nothing that does not fit its model of elegance. The theology behind classic style does not admit that there is anything that counts as truth that cannot be presented briefly and memorably. In practice, this simply means that classic style prefers to limit its domain while tacitly claiming universal application.

1.6.1 古典风格并非普遍适用

数学上有些定理因为优美和纯粹被视为高等艺术，比如哥德尔不完全性定理、伽罗瓦理论基本定理及韦德伯恩小定理（每一个有限整环都是域）。它们的证明一步一步推进，清晰且笃定，巧妙又高效，渐次攻克复杂烦琐的谜题，清晰有力的真相忽然之间出现在你面前，一旦指出，如此显然。当真相的光辉毕见无遗，它如此完整又如此完美，看着就非此不可，好像这些证明不是逐步论证的结果，而是呈现清晰简单的真相带来的完美发现。如果不是看到真相用这种方式展现出来，没人可以看到真相，但一旦看到，就会完整地看到，而且一眼就可以认出来。这就是数学证明的标志特点：简洁、高效、清晰、优雅和纯粹。古典风格认为这种优雅不仅是一种标准，而且普遍存在。

但是有一些数学问题，比如四色定理或者旅行商问题，它们的解决方式既不优雅也不纯粹。它们是消耗战。比如，四色定理问题最开始是通过一个计算机程序解决的，但要夜以继日地测试各种可能性然后一个个排除。能想到这种证明方式当然很聪明，但是证明过程本身，如果打印出来看起来就像它自己的样子：野蛮的机械应用。它的证明过程很难理解，也没人能记得全。这种证明没有呈现清晰简单的真相。至于旅行商问题，到现在也只能用近似法或探索法求解，一样要借助计算机做烦琐的计算。过去三百年来，很多顶尖的数学家尝试为这个问题及其相关问题找到最佳高效解决方案，但都没成功，导致现在有人怀疑根本不存在最佳高效解决方案。更糟糕的是，现在不少人怀疑甚至不存在高效的近似解决方案。如果压根不存在最佳高效解决方案，解决这些问题的唯一方法就是研究这样或那样的特殊案例，排除不确切或不完美的方案。

数学承认存在这种情况并发明了很多工具，比如数值方法，它们就不具备数学证明那简洁、简单和优雅的标志特点。而古典风格，不承认任何不符合它的优雅模型的东西。古典风格背后的信仰不承认无法用简单易记的方式呈现出来的真相。实际上，这恰恰说明古典风格主张普遍适用的同时又限制它的适用范围。

#### 1.6.2 Truth Is Not Mind-Independent

This, the most fundamental trade secret, concerns classic style's conception of truth. The classic stand on the elements of style depends upon a conception of a single objective state of affairs that is「the world」and a writer who sees that world without distortion. Of course, the classic writer has access to that world only through her own mind, but that mind has been cleared of all obstructions. In consequence, what it holds is a perfect and undistorted copy of objective truth.

Descartes formed the model for this view in saying that we can know there is God and that God would not have provided us with minds that are fundamentally deceptive. All error must therefore come from such perversions of our fundamental mental endowment as received opinion and prejudice. What is seen clearly and distinctly by a mind cleansed of perversions must necessarily be true.

The theology behind classic style has at its base this model: truth cannot be known independently of thought, but the thought through which it is known can be perfect. Although truth is never independent of mind, the classic writer can know a truth that can be conceived of as independent of mind, as purely「objective,」because the mind of the classic writer has introduced no distortion. There is no difference, then, between the truth the classic writer knows and the「objective」truth as seen from a God's-eye view, external to any particular mind.

The contemporary philosopher Hilary Putnam describes the view that there is an objective state of affairs that can be known objectively as an externalist perspective「because its favorite point of view is a God's Eye point of view.」

The trade secret, to put it bluntly, is that there is no such perspective available to anyone who is part of the human world. As Putnam says,「There is no God's Eye point of view that we can know or usefully imagine; there are only the various points of view of actual persons reflecting various interests and purposes that their descriptions and theories subserve.」Classic style always assumes that it might as well be standing outside the world of actual persons because the classic writer is above mere personal interest; he has no motive but truth, or at least, his highest and governing motive is truth. The classic perception of truth is a perfect copy of truth.

The trade secret can be expressed as two qualifications to the classic conception of truth. The first qualification is a practical limit: no writer can maintain for long the discipline needed to transcend personal interests and personal situations. The second qualification is an absolute limit: there is in fact no way at all even for the briefest space to know truth or the existence of truth independent of thought. All conceptions of truth and all supposedly true concepts are exactly that — conceptions and concepts.

The conception of truth assumed by classic style is based on what Putnam calls the「copy」theory: what is true corresponds to the mind-independent facts. Classic style cannot be described without recourse to this conception of truth, but the copy theory itself rests on a fundamentally impossible premise. How can we compare what we have thought and expressed in language to a mind-independent reality? How can we be independent of our own minds or have any access to what stands apart from mind? There have been many solutions proposed — they include Descartes's plan of cleansing the rational mind through applying judiciously the instrument of doubt, and the positivist plan of using the scientific method to factor out of theories any merely subjective components. But all such plans still involve human thought as the engine of escape, and it is not possible to escape the human mind through the faculties of the human mind.

It requires only a moment's thought to realize that any writer who claims that his writing is「clear and simple as the truth」is claiming that his access to the truth is essentially independent of his thought. It is a claim that can never be known to be true since, as Putnam says, it is impossible to verify a perfect correspondence (or any correspondence) between two things if we have access to just one of them. The classic writer actually has access only to his own thought. How can someone who has access only to thought check that his thought corresponds to mind-independent truth? It is like expecting someone who knows English but no Chinese to be able to claim that an English translation of a Chinese text is accurate. But the classic stand on the elements of style is always in the position of claiming that the translation is accurate with no access to the original except through the translation. The classic claim rests on impossible conditions — as do all the mature and consistent styles of which we are aware — but despite its internal incoherence, it has enjoyed an exceptionally important role in the way people think.

While it is beyond the scope of this book to consider in detail why such an incoherent view has had such a prominent place in the history of thought — much less to consider sophisticated alternatives to the copy theory — it is worth noting that the copy theory has an unparalleled two-thousand-year career in Western philosophy and has come to seem natural. Putnam thinks that「perhaps most philosophers hold some version of the ‘copy' theory of truth today」and furthermore that before Kant it may be impossible to find even one philosopher who did not hold such a theory. Even for Kant, the existence of some mind-independent reality is in Putnam's phrase「virtually a postulate of reason.」

「It's not what I think, it's what I know.」「See for yourself.」「Ask anyone.」「I would not have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself.」「This shipment has been checked and verified by trained inspectors.」All of these common expressions are normally understood with the help of a tacit reference to the copy theory. This is one way of suggesting what we think to be the case: classic style is not「classic」for no reason. It is so deeply entrenched in our normal way of looking at the world that the only commonsense alternative seems to be that we just make up the world we see, and every claim is as「true」as every other. Although this dichotomy is naïve, it is commonly accepted as inevitable. On that view, there is only one alternative to the copy theory, and it is so generally unacceptable that the copy theory, warts and all, has been embraced as the only possible protection from chaos.

1.6.2 客观真相依赖主观思想

这个是最核心的秘密，与古典风格对真相这个概念的理解有关。古典风格对风格元素的立场取决于一种认识：事物存在唯一的客观状态即「世界」，而作者能不偏不倚地看待这个世界。古典风格作者当然只能通过自己的大脑认识世界，但那颗大脑已经清除了所有障碍。因此它能完美地复制未被歪曲的客观真相。

笛卡儿提供了这个观点的模型，他说既然我们能知道上帝的存在，上帝就不会赋予我们完全不可信的思想。所有的错误都是因为我们与生俱来的基本思想被曲解为成见和偏见。一个大脑清除了曲解的人看得清楚明白的东西必定是真的。

古典风格背后的信仰正是以这种模型为基础：没有思想就无法看到真相，但看到真相所依靠的思想完美无瑕。尽管真相无法独立于思想，但是古典风格作者知道一种纯粹「客观」的真相，它可以被看作独立于思想，因为古典风格作者没有引进任何曲解。从这点来看，古典风格作者看到的真相，与以「上帝之眼」看到的「客观」真相没有差别，都不是某个人特有的思想。

当代哲学家希拉里·普特南（Hilary Putnam）这样描述该观点，事物有一种客观状态，可以客观地称其为外在主义视角，「因为它最推崇的是一种上帝的眼光」。① 26

① 汉译文出自《理性、真理与历史》童世骏和李光程的合译版本。一一 译者注

坦白说，古典风格的秘密是，只要你是人类社会的一分子，就不可能拥有这种视角。正如普特南所讲，「并不存在我们能知道或能有效地想象的上帝的眼光；存在着的只是现实的人的各种看法，这些现实的人思考着他们的理论或描述为之服务的各种利益和目的」。古典风格的立场总是假定最好站在现实的人的世界之外，因为古典风格作者超越了纯粹的个人利益；他唯一的动机是真相，至少他最高的主导动机是真相。古典风格对真相的观察是对真相的完美复制。

古典风格的秘密也可以说是古典风格真相观念的两个限制条件。第一个是实践上的局限性：没有哪位作者能够一直严守纪律、不顾个人利益和个人处境；第二个是绝对的局限性：事实上，脱离了思想，人类根本就不可能知道真相或真相的存在。所有的真相观念（conceptions）及所有被以为正确的概念（concepts）只是 —— 观念和概念。

2『古典风格真相观念的 2 个局限，做一张任意卡片。（2022-03-20）』—— 已完成

古典风格假定的真相观念是基于普特南所说的「复制」理论：即真相对应独立于思想的事实。没有这种真相观念就没人能描述古典风格，但复制理论本身基于一个根本不可能的前提。我们怎么可能将脑中所想和语言所述之物与独立于思想的事实类比呢？我们怎么可能独立于自己的思想或者知道自己思想之外的事物呢？提出的方案有很多 —— 它们包括笛卡儿的净化方案，借助审慎的怀疑来净化理智的大脑；还有实证主义者的排除方案，运用科学方法从理论看法中排除任何纯粹主观的东西。所有这些方案还是用人类的思想充当逃离引擎，但人不可能通过人类的思想能力逃脱人类的思想。

想想就会意识到，任何作者声称自己写得「像真相一样清晰简单」，就等于声称自己看到的真相完全独立于他的思想。我们永远都无法判断这种说法是真是假，诚如普特南所说，如果我们只知道两个事物中的一个，就不可能验证两者是否完全对应（或某些部分对应）。古典风格作者实际上只知道自己的思想。一个只知道自己思想的人，怎么能核实他的思想与独立于思想的真相一致呢？这就像我们期待一个只会英文不会中文的人断言某个中文文本的英文翻译正确无误一样。但是，古典风格在风格元素上的立场总是声称，不用回溯原文，光看翻译就能判断翻译的正误。古典风格的主张基于不可能实现的条件 —— 这跟所有成熟一致的风格一样 —— 尽管它的内在逻辑不通，但它在人们的思考方式上发挥着十分重要的作用。

虽然本书的重点不是讨论为什么这种自相矛盾的观点能在思想历史上占据如此重要的地位，更别说讨论其他可能替代复制理论的成熟理论了，但值得注意的是，复制理论在西方哲学生涯中有长达两千年的、不可超越的历史，而且看起来理所应当。普特南认为「也许现在大多数哲学家认同某种版本的真相复制理论」，康德之前的哲学家没有谁不认同这个理论。在康德看来，存在某种独立于思想的事实 —— 用普特南的话说 ——「几乎是个合理的假设」。

「这不是我想的，这是我知道的。」「你自己去看。」「随便问什么人。」「要不是我亲眼看到，我也不相信。」「有经验的检查员已经核验过了。」所有这些常见表达，人们一般都能理解，其实是默认参照了复制理论。这从一个侧面支持了我们的观点：古典风格的「古典」是有原因的。这种观点在我们日常看待世界的方式中如此根深蒂固，以至唯一合理的替代理论似乎是，我们只是编造了我们看到的世界，每种看法和任何其他看法一样「真实」。虽然这种看法极端又天真，但普遍认为这是唯一说得通的看法。从这点来看，复制理论只有一种替代理论，而且很多人并不接受，所以综合利弊，只有支持复制理论，才可能避免混乱。

### 1.7 Envoi: Style Is Not Etiquette

This book is meant to be a guide to learning classic style and approaches its subject from the inside out, so to speak. Although it takes for granted that its audience writes in English, the style it discusses is not confined to any particular language. It is a style used by ancient Greek writers such as Thucydides, and it is a style used by a distinguished group of seventeenth-century French writers, most of whom knew no Greek; it is a style used by the French chemist Lavoisier in the eighteenth century, and by the American reporter and press critic A. J. Liebling in the twentieth. The principles this book discusses are a stand on the elements of style, not the foundation of a usage manual of one or more varieties of English. Anyone who has attained competence in any language can learn classic style because the principles of the style are as applicable to Japanese or Bengali as they are to English.

We have tried to distinguish the concept of style from the much broader concept of writing, but it is not easy to prevent two commonplace American conflations: style with writing, and writing with English. Most Americans learn to write in English courses, and surveys have shown that what most people mean by English is, first, spelling and then, usage (「can and may,」「affect and effect,」「imply and infer,」and so on through a list of indefinite length).

In addition to books treating fundamental aspects of writing, there is a large and ever-growing number of what amount to etiquette books on conventions of usage and other surface features that proceed from the tacit assumption that someone who masters all these points of etiquette will be able to write「English.」This assumption is a corollary of the thesis that knowing something consists of knowing surface details.

Consider a couple of almost universally effective put-downs based on this assumption.「How on earth can X know anything about epistemology? He can't even spell it!」The equivalent dismissal for spoken language is:「What can Y possibly know about Degas? She can't even pronounce his name!」These are almost invariably effective lines, even though neither has any merit. It is perfectly possible to know a great deal about anything anyone cares to name without being able to spell it or pronounce it according to a prevailing convention.

We will not say it is absolutely impossible to learn to write what will pass for standard English by learning everything in an etiquette book about current conventions in spelling and by consistently distinguishing「allusion」from「illusion」and making similar distinctions between all the other sets of terms frequently confused. But it is a most unlikely procedure, being something like Malcolm X's attempt to attain literacy by memorizing a dictionary. The problem is that anyone seeking to learn something about writing from an etiquette book — and dictionaries are one kind of linguistic etiquette book — remains forever passive to its advice; there is no set of principles to grasp that can ever make such a person independent of the etiquette book. Consider that a competent speaker of English will never make a mistake about fundamental word order: it really is impossible for such a speaker to be uncertain about whether to say「Pass me the molasses」or「Me molasses pass the,」but the same speaker may never be confident of spelling「molasses」correctly even if he becomes editor in chief of a newspaper or a professor of English.

What gives a writer command of a style is not mere correctness; even if an essay, a letter, a report, or a book is completely「correct,」it may also be completely incoherent; it may entirely fail to accomplish what its writer has set out to do. The performance, if merely correct, even should it work, can never be more than an isolated success that leaves no permanent trace. Charles de Gaulle once startled his hosts on a state visit to Moscow by delivering a speech in quite correct and intelligible Russian. Until then, he had not been known to speak the language. Intelligence services in several countries were embarrassed by their apparent lapse in gathering information about his linguistic range, until they found out that they had been right all along. He really did not speak Russian; he merely had been coached to pronounce the Russian words correctly, group them in an apparently thoughtful way by memorizing a tape, and deliver them with appropriate inflection through the same device. It was an actor's trick skillfully carried off. The performance was sensational, but it did not make de Gaulle a Russophone; he remained completely incompetent in the language.

This little book does not offer itself as a short cut to the impossible goal of learning to write English or any other language. It does not aim for something as vague as excellence in a skill as indefinite as writing English. It aims for the eminently possible goal of perfect understanding in a much more definite domain: classic style, with a local application to English. The first goal,「writing English,」is as much a mirage as perfect spelling; the second goal, writing classic prose, is as attainable as correct word order. If you cannot remember the difference between「effect」and「affect,」this book will not help you, and neither of its authors will ever win a spelling bee, but then no one can ever become a competent writer if we consider mastery of the indefinite list of accidentals at the surface of any language to be competence in writing. Is there any competent speaker of English anywhere who can pronounce, spell, and use every word in the OED or Webster's? Does that mean there are no competent speakers of English? What a competent writer can know perfectly are the principles of a style, and no style is an inert set of rules. Once the principles are grasped and the writer begins to use the style from a position of command, the writer becomes active in that style, and the style becomes part of the writer's active competence as surely and perfectly as word order. There is unlimited room for invention and discovery within the constraints of the style just as there is unlimited room for meaning and expression within the constraints of the word order of English, for the mastery of a style, like the underlying linguistic competence, is a living activity, not a rote performance.
