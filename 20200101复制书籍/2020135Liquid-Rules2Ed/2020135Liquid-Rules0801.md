# 0801. Cleansing

AS I STUMBLED TOWARD the loo, I felt more than a little uncertain on my feet; my bad knee clicked, and I occasionally lost my balance as the airplane rumbled through the stratosphere. There were blankets half-covering slumbering passengers, and as I progressed down the aisle, I got quick snapshots of my fellow passengers' viewing habits as they watched their liquid-crystal displays: a woman singing onstage; a judge wearing a wig, looking stern in a courtroom; Spider-Man leaping. Some people were sleeping, and some were tapping away at their laptops, their faces illuminated by their screens. When I finally got to the end of the aisle, the lavatories were all occupied and I had to wait in the corridor, with the cabin crew squeezing past me to serve the passengers in business class. I glanced enviously through the gap in the curtains that separated us and caught a glimpse of reclining passengers, being ministered to as if they were Roman emperors. Then I heard the click of the lock being slid back, and saw a bright light burst forth from the lavatory. A man quickly and impassively vacated the cubicle. Did I detect a slight look of apology on his face? I braced myself for a potentially horrible smell as I entered the stall but was relieved to find that the air smelled neutral, with a hint of synthetic lemon.

I lifted the toilet seat, had a long pee, and then pressed a button to initiate the vacuum flush mechanism. I always find this a little threatening. The sucking and roaring goes on a little too long, as if to say,「Yeah, who you looking at? I could suck you down this little hole too.」I turned to the basin to wash my hands and was confronted by two bottles with pump-action dispensers. I went for the one that looked more like soap and gave the bottle a couple of pumps; it squirted a clear yellow liquid into my hand. I've never really liked liquid soap; I object to the squirting action. It always reminds me of a small pet peeing with fright into your hand the moment you pick it up.

When I was growing up, liquid soap hadn't been invented. We just had bars of soap. These were so ubiquitous that basins were manufactured with indentations specifically designed to hold the soap so it wouldn't slip onto the floor or into the sink. Now bars of soap are in the minority, and becoming ever less popular. So is this progress? Is liquid soap really so much better than bars? Or is liquid soap just a modern fad, marketed to us on false pretenses, something that will eventually disappear, like flared trousers and CDs?

清洁杀菌的  ——  肥皂、洗衣液、洗发水、洗手液

当我蹒跚地走向卫生间时，我的腿脚似乎有些不稳当，那副不受用的膝盖「咔嗒」作响，飞机轰鸣地徜徉在平流层中，而我冷不丁地失去了平衡。有些乘客睡得正熟，毯子半盖在身上，当我沿着过道往前走的时候，也在液晶屏上迅速地看到了同行旅客们的观影内容：有的是舞台上正在唱歌的女歌手；有的是法庭上戴着假发的法官，表情严肃；还有的是正在四处跳跃的蜘蛛侠。有些人在睡觉，有些人在自己的笔记本电脑上敲击着，他们的脸被屏幕照亮。当我走到过道尽头的时候，却发现卫生间里有人，我不得不在过道里等着，与那些正在服务商务舱乘客的机组人员挤在一起。我妒忌地从隔开我们的门帘缝隙中瞥了一眼，躺下的乘客们正像罗马皇帝一样享受着侍奉。然后我听到锁扣滑动的声音，一道亮光从厕所中漏了出来，一名男性迅速而又面无表情地离开了这里。我在他的脸上捕捉到一丝歉意了吗？当我进入卫生间的时候，准备好迎接一股潜在的臭味，却发现空气闻起来是中性的，带有一点儿人工合成的柠檬香味，这才松了一口气。

我抬起马桶座，撒了一泡长长的尿，然后按下启动真空冲洗装置的按钮。我总是感觉这有些危险，水被吸入并咆哮的持续时间有些太久了，好像是在说：「喂，你看什么呢？小心我把你顺着这个小孔一起吸走。」我转过身去洗手，面前摆着两个装有按压泵的瓶子。我选了其中一个看起来最像肥皂的，往下按了两下，它便朝我的手喷出一点儿清澈的黄色液体。我从来没有真正喜欢过洗手液，也抵触这种喷射方式。它总是会让我想起某种小宠物，当你抱起它的时候，它会吓得朝你手上撒尿。

当我还是个孩子的时候，洗手液还没有被发明出来，那时只有块状的肥皂。那种肥皂十分普遍，以至于洗脸盆都会设计出专门的凹槽来放置肥皂，这样它就不会滑到地板上或水槽中。如今，块状肥皂非常少见，也越来越不受欢迎。可这是进步吗？洗手液真的比肥皂块好很多吗？或者说，洗手液只是一种现代时尚，向我们推销虚假的产品理念，最终也会像喇叭裤或 CD 机一样消失？

## 8.1 Soap Degreasing with Fat

It's hard to say, without first understanding the advantages and disadvantages of normal soap. Soap is a miraculous substance. You can wash yourself with the clearest, purest, hottest water, but you will not get rid of any of the oily, grimy muck that's caked onto your skin. For most of history, we weren't unduly worried about this. People smelled; they were dirty. No one cared. We had bigger problems, and no sense of why soap might be important. Which isn't to say soap didn't exist. Recipes for making soap have been found on ancient Mesopotamian clay tablets dating as far back as 2200 BCE but this material has almost certainly been around longer. The process described is similar to how we make soap today: take ashes from a wood fire, dissolve them in water, and boil the solution with melted tallow (animal fat) — and magically you have a basic soap. While the Mesopotamians didn't necessarily use soap to bathe, they did use it to clean wool before weaving it into fabric. The soap removed the lanolin, a kind of grease, from the wool fibers.

But why would you use fat to remove grease? The secret is in the ash water; the Arabic word for it is alkali, which literally means「from the ashes.」Alkalis are the opposite of acids, but both are highly reactive and can transform other molecules. In this case the alkali transforms the fats.

One of the main constituents of tallow, a molecule called a triglyceride. This has three tails that can be snipped off, using alkali.

Fats, such as animal tallow, are made up of carbon molecules, with a three-armed chemical structure of glycerides bound together at one end by oxygen atoms. Their structure is completely different from water's much smaller H 2 O molecules. Water molecules are not just smaller than triglycerides; they are also polar, meaning the electric charges on the molecule are not distributed equally: there is a positive part and a negative part. This polarity is what makes water such a good solvent: it is electrically attracted to, and surrounds, other charged atoms and molecules, thus absorbing them. Water dissolves salt in this way, it dissolves sugar in this way, it dissolves alcohol in this way. But fat and oil molecules aren't polarized, so they can't dissolve in water. This is why oil and water don't mix.

The alkali produced from wood ash, however, splits into positive and negative components, so it dissolves in water. The resulting solution chemically reacts with the fat molecules, snipping off the three tails of the triglycerides, making them charged. This produces three soap molecules (called stearates). These hybrid molecules have an electrically charged head, which likes to dissolve in water, and a carbon tail, which likes to dissolve in oils — it's this hybrid nature that makes soap so useful.

The active ingredient in soap, stearate, showing its charged head, which is「water-loving,」and a carbon tail, which is「fat-loving.」

When soap molecules come in contact with a blob of oil, the carbon tail of the molecule immediately buries itself in it, thanks to their chemical similarities. But the charged head of the soap wants to get as far away from the oil as possible, so it ends up just sticking out of the blob. As more soap molecules do the same, they form a molecular structure that looks like a tuft of dandelion seed: a blob of oil surrounded by a cloud of soap molecules, with their electrically charged heads sticking out.

Soap cleans by the action of surfactant molecules, such as stearates. The fat-loving tail of the molecule is absorbed into oil, leaving the water-loving head sticking out. The cloud of water-loving heads surrounding the oil allows it to be dissolved in the water and so cleans a surface.

Because the blob of oil or fat has now got a charged surface, it's become polar, and so will dissolve happily in water. This is how soap cleans — it breaks up fat and oil residue on your hands and clothes into tiny spherical blobs, which can dissolve in water and be washed away.

The clean, dry feeling you get from washing your hands with soap comes from the soap's ability to remove oils from your skin. At the same time, soap is slippery precisely because of its own fatty nature — it's basically modified fat. That's why it slips out of your hand so easily. It is why soaps are used as lubricants — if you are trying to remove a ring from a swollen finger, soap can slip it right off.

Using soap to clean creates a special type of liquid; it's dirty water, yes, but it's made up not just of dirt, but also of balls of fat. In effect, it's one liquid suspended in another — an emulsion. Emulsions are very useful because they allow you to suspend many different types of liquid in water. Mayonnaise, for instance, is a very concentrated suspension of oil in water, and its ratio of oil to water is roughly 3:1. You make it by shaking the two together vigorously, until they form a cream. If you did only that, though, the liquids would separate, because as we know, oil and water don't mix. But if you add a soaplike molecule, it will stabilize the droplets of oil. For mayonnaise, the binding molecule comes from eggs. Egg yolks contain a substance called lecithin, which has a molecular structure very similar to that of soap (with a fat-loving tail and a water-loving head), and when you add them to your oil-water mixture, they bind it all together and make mayonnaise. Egg yolk can also clean your hands, just as soap does, and there are plenty of shampoo recipes that use egg yolk as an essential cleaning ingredient. Mustard is another substance that can emulsify oils — which is why if you add mustard to oil and vinegar, which otherwise don't mix well, it will form a stable emulsion known as a vinaigrette. All these active substances work in the same way, and they all have a shared name: they're interface molecules called surfactants.

用脂肪去油的香皂

如果不事先了解普通肥皂的优、缺点，上述问题恐怕很难回答。肥皂是一种神奇的物质。你可以用最清澈、最干净或是最热的水清洗自己，但是对那些黏在你皮肤表面油腻又肮脏的污垢，你却无可奈何。在很长一段历史里，我们并不是很介意此事。人们身上臭烘烘、脏兮兮的，但没有人在乎。我们还需要解决更大的问题，肥皂怎么会变得如此重要呢？但这不是说，肥皂过去就不存在。在古代美索不达米亚的泥板上发现的肥皂制作配方，追溯到了公元前 2200 年，但我们几乎可以肯定，这种材料出现的时间更早。配方中描述的工艺与我们今天制作肥皂的方法类似：取出柴火堆的灰烬，将它们溶解在水中，然后加入熔化的牛油（动物脂肪）煮沸，于是你就神奇地拥有了一块朴素的肥皂。虽然美索不达米亚人未必会使用肥皂洗澡，但是在将羊毛织成纤维前，他们用肥皂清洁羊毛。肥皂可以除去羊毛纤维中的一种油脂 —— 羊毛脂。

但你为什么会用脂肪去除油脂呢？答案就在草木灰的溶液中，阿拉伯词汇称其为「碱」，字面意思是「提取自草木灰」。碱和酸是两种对立的物质，但是两者都具有高度的反应活性，可以转化为其他分子。在这个例子中，碱可以转化为脂肪。

牛油中的一种主要成分，叫作甘油三酯，分子上的三条「尾巴」可以用碱切除诸如动物油脂这样的脂肪，由含碳的分子构成，具有甘油酯的三臂结构，其中一端通过氧原子连接在一起。这种结构与水完全不同，水要小得多，分子式为 H2O。水分子还是极性的，这就意味着分子上的电荷分布并不均匀：既有正电性的部分，也有负电性的部分。这种极性让水成为良好的溶剂。因为电荷作用，水被其他带电的原子或分子吸引或包围，从而将它们吸收。通过这种方式，水可以溶解食盐、糖和酒精。但是油脂分子不是极性的，所以不能溶解在水中，这就是油和水不能混合的原因。

然而，草木灰产生的碱可以解离为正电性和负电性两个部分，所以它可以溶于水。由此产生的溶液与脂肪分子发生化学反应，切断甘油三酯的三个尾部，并使它们带电荷，这就产生了三个肥皂分子（被称为硬脂酸盐）。重要的是，这些都是双亲性分子，它们有一个带电的头部，喜欢溶解在水中，还有一个碳原子链构成的尾部，喜欢溶解在油中。正是这种双亲特性，让肥皂变得非常有用。

肥皂中的有效成分硬脂酸盐，图中可见其带电的头部，这是「亲水部分」，还有碳原子构建的尾部，这是「亲油部分」

当肥皂分子与一滴油接触时，由于化学性质相似，碳链构成的分子尾部会立即埋进油滴中。而带有电荷的头部却想要尽可能离油滴远一些，所以它最终会从油滴中探出来。当更多的肥皂分子都这样做时，它们就构成了一种看起来很像蒲公英种子的分子结构：一团油滴被肥皂分子包围，它们带电荷的头部全都伸了出来。

肥皂有清洁作用，是因为硬脂酸盐等表面活性剂分子的特性。分子中亲油的尾端被油脂吸收，留下亲水的头部伸在外面。一团亲水的头部将油脂包裹，使其能够溶解在水中，这样就能清洁物体表面了。

因为现在这团油或脂肪有了一个带电的表面，它就变得有极性了，所以很欢快地溶解到了水中。这就是肥皂如何清洁的方法 —— 它可以将手上和衣服上的油脂分解成细小的球状液滴，溶解在水中并被冲走。

你用肥皂洗完手后会有一种干爽的感觉，这是因为肥皂将你皮肤上的油脂去除了。相反，肥皂之所以很滑腻，正是因为它本质上就是改性脂肪。所以，它非常容易从你的手中滑落。这一特性也让肥皂变成了润滑剂，当你试图从肿胀的手指上取下戒指时，肥皂可以助你一臂之力。

用肥皂清洗会产生一种特殊的液体，它的确是一种脏水，但它不仅由污垢组成，还含有脂肪微球。事实上，它悬浮于另一种液体之中，形成了乳液。乳液十分有用，因为它能让你把许多不同类型的液体悬浮于水中。比如，蛋黄酱是一种油悬浮于水中的高浓缩液，油与水的比例约为 3∶1。你可以使劲摇晃这两种物质的混合液，直到它们形成奶油。但如果你这么做，液体就会分离，因为正如我们所知道的，油和水不能混合。但是如果你加入某种类似于肥皂的分子，它就可以使油滴稳定。对于蛋黄酱而言，具有这种结合力的分子来源于鸡蛋，蛋黄含有一种叫作卵磷脂的物质，它具有非常类似于肥皂的结构（有亲油的尾部与亲水的头部）。当你将它加入油水混合物后，便会将两者结合在一起，形成蛋黄酱。蛋黄也可以像肥皂一样清洁你的双手，很多洗发水的配方就是用蛋黄作为基础清洁组分。芥末是另一种可以使油发生乳化的物质，所以如果你在油和醋中加入芥末，便可以形成叫作「芥末醋汁」的稳定乳液，否则油和醋就不能很好地混合在一起。所有这些活性物质都以同样的方式工作，它们都有一个共同的名字：被称为「表面活性剂」的界面分子。

## 8.2 The role of Soap as a Detergent

But soap doesn't just remove oils and fats; it also removes the bacteria attached to those oils and fats. Washing your hands with soap is the single most effective way to protect against bacterial infection and viruses. But despite the efficaciousness of soap as a cleaning agent, and its discovery so early in human development, the regular use of soap for cleanliness and personal hygiene is a modern phenomenon.

Throughout history, different cultures took very different stances on the use of soap. The Romans didn't really use it, preferring to scrape off their sweat and dirt and then bathe in first hot, then cold water, to get clean. Their public baths were an important part of their culture, and relied on a sophisticated engineering infrastructure to provide hot and cold water. In Europe, after the Roman Empire collapsed, the infrastructure that kept the public baths going fell into ruin, and so bathing went out of fashion. In crowded cities and towns, which had limited access to clean water, bathing came to be considered a health risk. During the Middle Ages, many Europeans believed that diseases were spread through miasma and bad air. They thought that washing, especially with hot water, opened up the pores and made a person more susceptible to diseases, such as the bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death. There was also a moral component associated with washing at this time; to be holy, like a hermit or saint, involved rejection of comfort and luxury. Hence, the more you smelled, the closer to God you might be perceived to be.

These attitudes to cleanliness, which seem so peculiar now, were not the norm in other parts of the world, and so visitors from the East would have found even the royal Europeans bewilderingly smelly and dirty, just as we would, looking at them from our modern vantage point. But the cultural norms of the past often seem disgusting in hindsight. It wasn't that long ago that smoking was considered quite normal, and the smell of smoke was pretty much everywhere, in offices, restaurants, bars, and trains. I still remember a time when smoking was allowed on airplanes. Now we look back with a mixture of horror and puzzlement as to how we got ourselves into that predicament. Seen in this light, the era of filthy, smelly Europeans is perhaps not so surprising.

As with smoking, the consequences of general uncleanliness were not just aesthetic. In the nineteenth century, it was still normal practice for doctors to travel from bedside to bedside without changing their clothes or washing their hands after examining women during childbirth. This practice caused incredibly high rates of maternal and infant mortality during childbirth. In 1847 a Hungarian obstetrician, Ignaz Semmelweis, mandated that physicians at the hospital in Vienna where he worked scrub their hands with a chlorinated lime solution before touching patients, and saw the death rate there fall from 20 percent to 1 percent. Despite this evidence, doctors were still reluctant to accept the idea that they might be carrying infections on their hands and transferring them to their patients, thus causing an enormous number of deaths. It wasn't until the 1850s, when a British nurse, Florence Nightingale, took up her campaign for cleanliness that this attitude was really adopted, first in military hospitals and then more widely. Crucially, she gathered statistics and invented new types of mathematical charts to show her evidence to doctors, and to the public, about the causes of disease and mortality. Gradually, as scientific evidence mounted, germ theory was accepted more generally by nurses and doctors, and hygienic washing with soaps became common practice in hospitals. Of course, not all soaps are created equal, and soap's new role in keeping people clean and healthy came at a time when industrialization and marketing were combining to create our modern Western consumerist culture. Soap was ready to transition from a commodity into a commercial product.

肥皂的清洁剂角色

但是肥皂不仅能去除油脂，还能去除附着在油脂上的细菌。用肥皂洗手，是防止细菌和病毒感染的最有效方法。尽管肥皂作为清洁剂效果很好，并在人类发展的早期就已诞生，但是将肥皂作为常规的清洁与个人卫生用品是现代才出现的。

纵观历史，不同文化对待肥皂的态度迥然不同。罗马人并没有真正使用肥皂，他们更喜欢机械地刮去身上的汗水和污垢，再用热水和冷水依次冲洗，这样便干净了。他们的公共浴室是其文化的重要组成部分，复杂的基础建设工程提供了热水与冷水。在欧洲，随着罗马帝国的毁灭，维持公共浴室的基础设施化为一片废墟，于是浴场也就不再流行。拥挤的城镇没有洁净的水源入口，越来越多的人认为洗澡这件事存在健康隐患。在中世纪，许多欧洲人认为疾病是通过瘴气和浑浊的空气传播的，于是他们想到，洗澡会使毛孔打开，特别是用热水的时候，这就更容易让人感染一些疾病，比如鼠疫（它还有个更出名的称呼叫「黑死病」）。在这一时期，洗澡也和道德因素有关，要想神圣得像隐士或圣人一般，就要拒绝舒适与奢华。你的身上越臭，你就越接近上帝。

这种关于清洁的特殊态度并没有出现在世界的其他地方，因此来自东方的旅客就会发现，即便是皇室出身的欧洲人，身上也是脏兮兮的，散发出难闻的气味，就像我们以现代视角审视他们一样。但是，过去的文化规范以后世的眼光来看，往往都是令人作呕的。不久前，吸烟还是很正常的行为，办公室、餐馆、酒吧还有火车上，到处都充斥着烟味。我还记得有一次在飞机上抽烟也是被允许的。如今，我们却带着恐惧与困惑的心情，回顾自己当时是如何陷入困境的。从这个角度来说，欧洲人肮脏恶臭的时代，或许并不那么令人惊讶。

和吸烟一样，不洁的后果通常不只表现在审美方面。19 世纪时，医生检查完分娩的妇女后，会在病床间来回穿梭，却从来都不换衣服或洗手，而这在当时是十分正常的。这种做法导致了分娩过程中产妇与婴儿难以置信的高死亡率。1847 年，匈牙利一位名叫伊格纳斯·塞麦尔维斯（Ignaz Semmelweis）的产科医生指出，医生在接触病人之前需要用加氯的石灰溶液 [21] 洗手，病人死亡率会因此从 20% 降低到 1%。然而，医生们对此不以为然，仍然不相信他们手上可能携带着感染物，大量患者因感染而死。直到 19 世纪 50 年代，英国一位名叫弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔（Florence Nightingale）的护士发起了清洁运动，这一主张才被普遍接受，先是在军事医院，随后被更广泛地应用开来。最关键的是，她采集了统计数据，并发明了新型的数学图表，向医生和公众展示了她收集到的有关疾病和死因存在必然联系的证据。随着科学证据逐渐增多，细菌理论也慢慢被医生和护士接受，用肥皂进行卫生清洗也成了医院的普遍做法。当然，并非所有的肥皂都「生而平等」，肥皂在保持人们清洁与健康方面所扮演的新角色，出现在工业化与市场化共同塑造现代西方消费主义文化的时期。肥皂已经做好准备，从日用品向商业产品过渡。

## 8.3 Does Laundry detergent irritate the skin?

At forty thousand feet, in a tiny airplane lavatory, I too was hoping to use soap to make a transition: from weary to refreshed, clean, and bright-eyed traveler. I washed my hands in the tiny basin and inspected myself in the mirror. My eyes were red, and the skin around them looked dry and wrinkly; my face appeared yellow and sickly. I checked the light bulb to see if it was bluish fluorescent. It was. Maybe that explains it, I thought. But then, on further inspection, I noticed, with horror, that I had a speck of yellow curry sauce on my shirt collar. Susan hadn't mentioned it, but then why should she? I instinctively tried to remove it with a bit of saliva. It was just under my chin, so I had to conduct the whole operation by looking in the mirror. But the enzymes in my saliva made no headway with the yellow (probably turmeric-based) spot; in fact, wetting my collar had just made the stain spread. After five minutes of dabbing, during which there were a few rattles at the lavatory door, I had only made it worse.

Laundry powder was one of the first industrial products based on soap. Everyone has to wash clothes, and the growing importance of hygiene and cleanliness shaped attitudes toward social status and class in the nineteenth century. If you wore dirty clothes to a party, or to church or to any other religious gathering, you were deemed not just poor and of low status, but increasingly you were also held to be immoral. No longer was it true that being smelly and dirty was a signifier of virtue. Germs and disease were now associated with unclean habits. So in 1885, when the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher declared that「Cleanliness is next to Godliness,」he was voicing a widely held belief that morality and spirituality had a physical manifestation, and soap was an indispensable aid to achieving this higher status.

At the same time, the spread of both railways and newspapers was bringing people together, making it possible to spread one message across a nation — soap brands were able to become national institutions. In the United States, Procter & Gamble (P&G) became the most powerful presence in the soap industry. Founded in Cincinnati in 1837 by two English immigrants, William Procter and James Gamble, the company was in the business of selling candles and soap, both made using tallow from the local meat industry. But as the nineteenth century progressed, the candle industry declined — first because of the popularity of whale oil, and then because of kerosene — while the market for soap grew. P&G invented Ivory soap and invested large sums in marketing it across the whole country, placing ads in national newspapers and magazines. Then, with the invention of the radio in the 1920s, P&G started sponsoring serial dramas. Their audience was mostly made up of women, alone at home during the day, washing clothes and doing housecleaning; these popular dramas came to be known by a term related to the product whose manufacturer sponsored them — 「soap operas.」

The invention of the washing machine liberated people — primarily women — from the demanding social ritual of washing clothes, and with it came a whole new set of substances to clean our dirty laundry. Soap, the primary material used to wash clothes for almost five thousand years, suddenly got a chemical upgrade: it became detergent. Detergents are a cocktail of cleaning agents; they contain surfactants like soap, but also many other ingredients to make them more effective and less environmentally damaging. In soap, the charged, water-loving head of the molecule is attracted to the calcium in water, so if you live in a place with hard water, the calcium will attach itself to the soap and form scum, just as it does on tea. Soap scum, though, looks slightly different — it's the whitish substance you get on your hands when you wash them with a bar of soap. The scum isn't just inconvenient; it also uses up the soap, so less of the bar is ultimately available for cleaning. It can also leave an unattractive gray residue on clothes.

What to do about soapy scum? You have to make soap that's less attracted to calcium. Chemists discovered a new set of molecules similar to those of soap, with a water-loving head and a fat-loving tail; but with these new molecules they could carefully control the electric charges and make them less attracted to calcium: these were the new surfactants.

As demand for detergents grew, competition between manufacturers became intense. Companies employed the best chemists they could find in the hope of creating better ones. They developed detergents containing mild bleaches, which could better preserve whites by reacting with the molecules responsible for brown stains, and snipping them up chemically. They also put fluorescent molecules into washing powder; these molecules, called optical brighteners, attach to the fibers of white clothes and stay there after the wash. Optical brighteners absorb invisible ultraviolet light and emit blue light, giving fabric that「whiter than white」look that so many detergent companies advertise. You can see how they work if you go to a nightclub: the ultraviolet lights over the dance floor activate the fluorescent molecules in your white clothes, making them glow.

The range of surfactants expanded. Anionic surfactants (in which the water-loving head of the molecule is negatively charged, as in soap) were created not just to avoid scum formation and remove dirt, but also to keep dirt from redepositing itself on the clothes during the wash. Cationic surfactants (in which the water-loving head of the molecule is positively charged) were developed as fabric conditioners. And non-ionic surfactants (in which the water-loving head of the molecule is neutral) remove dirt even at low temperatures and are less foamy than most other surfactants. Avoiding foam is important; foam does not help to remove stains, and it is inconvenient for washing machines to fill up with foam, as it is hard to get rid of. In fact detergents often contain antifoaming agents, to suppress bubble formation.

Biological enzymes are added to most detergents in an effort to reduce the environmental impact of washing clothes. The enzymes help to chemically snip up the proteins and starches you find in stains. They're able to remove stains at lower temperatures, which makes low-temperature washing machines much more effective, thus saving energy, and money. We call the enzymes biological because they're derived from natural enzymes found in living systems that do a similar job of degrading and mopping up unwanted stuff in the body. In the UK there are two kinds of laundry detergents: bio and non-bio. The bio-detergents contain enzymes, and while these clearly wash cleaner, the non-bio detergents are still available because of a persistent myth — which has never been verified — that bio-detergents irritate skin.

We obviously care a lot about clean clothes. But we also want clean, shiny, fresh-smelling hair. Enter shampoos. The word shampoo came to the English language from India, where it referred to a type of head massage using oils and lotions. The practice was imported to Britain during colonial times and eventually came to mean a type of hair washing. The first modern shampoo was created in the 1930s by Procter & Gamble; it was called Drene. Made with new, milder liquid surfactants, Drene was packaged in a glass bottle with a bright green-and-purple label. At about this same time, Unilever, Procter & Gamble's primary rival, came into business. Rivalry between these two global firms has led detergent innovation ever since.

洗衣液会刺激皮肤吗？

在 4 万英尺的高空中，在飞机上的一间小厕所内，我也希望用肥皂来完成一次过渡：从疲惫的旅行者变为一个精神饱满、干净利索的人。我在飞机厕所的小脸盆里洗手，在镜子中审视着自己。我的眼睛发红，周围的皮肤看起来又干又皱，而我的脸则透出一种病态的黄色。我检查了一下灯泡，看它是不是蓝色荧光灯。的确如此，「这或许就解释得通了，」我心想。不过，在后来进一步的检查中，我发现我的衬衫领子上沾了一点儿黄色的咖喱酱。苏珊也没提醒我一下，当然了，她又何必这么做？我本能地想用唾液把它清除，可它处在我的下巴下面，所以我不得不照着镜子进行整个操作。但我唾液中的酶对于黄斑（可能是因为咖喱酱含有姜黄）似乎没起什么作用，事实上，弄湿了衣领之后，污渍扩散得更大了。擦拭了 5 分钟后，我听到厕所的门上发出几下「啪嗒」的声响，而我把事情弄得更糟了。

洗衣粉是最早基于肥皂诞生的工业品之一。每个人都要洗衣服，卫生与清洁变得越来越重要，这也形成了 19 世纪人们对社会地位和阶级的判断标准。如果你穿着脏衣服去参加聚会、去教堂或是其他宗教集会，人们不仅会觉得你贫穷而卑微，还会更多地将其归咎于不道德。恶臭与肮脏不再是美德的象征，细菌与疾病则与不卫生的坏习惯有关。因此到了 1885 年，当牧师亨利·沃德·比彻（Henry Ward Beecher）宣布「清洁仅次于虔诚」时，他表达了一种被普遍接受的主张，即道德与精神都会表现在物质层面，肥皂正是确立物质这一崇高地位不可或缺的辅助品。

与此同时，铁路和报纸的普及，将人们汇集在了一起，也让一条信息在全国范围内传播成为可能，肥皂品牌因此家喻户晓。在美国，宝洁公司（P&G）成为肥皂行业中最具影响力的公司。保洁公司于 1837 年在辛辛那提成立，由英国移民威廉·波克特（William Procter）和詹姆斯·甘波尔（James Gamble）经营，销售蜡烛和肥皂，这两种产品都是使用当地肉制品行业的副产品牛油制成的。但是由于鲸油的普及以及后来煤油的普及，蜡烛行业开始衰退，肥皂市场却在增长。宝洁公司发明了「象牙」香皂，投入巨资在全国范围行销，并在各大报纸和杂志上投放广告。后来，随着收音机在 20 世纪 20 年代被发明出来，宝洁公司开始赞助连续剧，听众主要是白天独自在家洗衣服、干家务的女性。这些连续剧非常受欢迎，并且最终以赞助它们的商品命名 —— 肥皂剧。

洗衣机的发明，让人们（主要是女性）从洗衣服这项苛刻的社会活动中解放出来。随之而来的，是一系列清洗脏衣服的全新的产品。肥皂作为洗衣服的主要伴侣已经延续了近 5 000 年，却在忽然之间升级变成了洗衣液。洗衣液是清洁物质的混合物，既含有肥皂这样的表面活性剂，也有一些其他的成分，因此清洁效果更强，对环境的污染也更少。在肥皂中，分子中带电且亲水的头部会被水中的钙吸引，所以如果你生活在一个水质偏硬的地方，钙就会附着在肥皂上形成浮沫，就像硬水与茶之间发生的反应。不过，肥皂的浮沫看起来有些不同，这是你用肥皂洗手时，手上沾到的白色物质。浮沫不仅会造成不便，也浪费了肥皂；肥皂要是太少，就不能发挥清洁作用。除此以外，它还会在衣服上留下难看的灰色残留物。

如何避免出现肥皂的浮沫呢？那就得让肥皂对钙的吸引力弱一些。化学家发现了一类新的分子，它们很像肥皂，有着亲水的头部和亲油的尾部，但是利用这些分子时，化学家可以小心翼翼地控制电荷，使它们对钙的吸引力下降。它们都是新型的表面活性剂。

随着人们对清洁剂的需求不断增长，制造商之间的竞争也日趋激烈。公司雇佣了他们所能找到的最优秀的化学家，希望能制造出更好的清洁剂。他们开发了含有温和漂白剂的清洁剂，与那些形成棕色斑点的物质进行反应，用化学手段将其去除，由此可以更好地保持衣服的白色。他们还将荧光分子加入洗衣粉，称其为荧光增白剂，附着在白色衣服的纤维上，并且在洗完以后一直保留下来。荧光增白剂能吸收肉眼看不见的紫外线并发出蓝光，使织物看起来「比白色更白」，这也成为很多清洁产品公司的广告语。如果你去夜总会，便会发现它们的工作原理：舞池里的紫外线激活了你白色衣服上的荧光分子，并使它们发光。

表面活性剂的范围也扩大了。阴离子表面活性剂（分子中亲水的头部像肥皂一样带负电荷）的出现，不只是为了避免浮沫形成并去除污垢，也是为了防止它们在洗涤过程中重新在衣服上沉积。阳离子表面活性剂（分子中亲水的头部带正电荷）则被开发为织物的调理剂。此外，还有非离子表面活性剂（分子中亲水的头部是中性的），即使在低温条件下也能去除污垢，并且比大多数其他类型表面活性剂的泡沫更少。避免泡沫产生是很重要的，泡沫不利于去除污渍。如果洗衣机填满了泡沫，也会变得不好用，因为泡沫很难被冲掉。事实上，洗涤剂中往往都含有消泡剂来抑制气泡的产生。

大多数洗涤剂都添加了生物酶，以减少洗衣服对环境的影响。这些酶有助于切断污渍中蛋白质和淀粉的化学反应，故而能够在较低的温度下去除污渍，这让低温洗衣机更有效，由此节省能源和金钱。我们管这种酶叫生物酶，因为它们源自生物系统中的天然酶，它们在降解和清除体内不需要的物质时，发挥的也是类似作用。英国有两种类型的洗衣液：生物型与非生物型。生物型洗衣液含有酶，尽管它们洗得明显更干净，但是非生物型洗衣液依然有人用，因为长久以来一直有个说法：生物型洗衣液会刺激皮肤，虽然这从未被证实。

## 8.4 The mysterious ingredients in Shampoo

If you look at the ingredients in a bottle of modern shampoo, you are likely to see something called sodium lauryl sulfate, or its cousin, sodium laureth sulfate. These are the building blocks of most modern shampoos; they're both very effective surfactants that do not interact strongly with calcium in water, and so do not form scum. They also do something else that we've come to consider an essential part of shampoo — they foam. And they do it very, very well.

Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) — notice the water-loving head and the fat-loving tail.

When you're using shampoo, foam is created while you're scrubbing, trapping air in water as you lather. The air tries to escape from the water, and when it reaches the surface of the liquid, it forms a bubble. If you're scrubbing your hair without any surfactants, the bubble will just be a thin film of pure water, which has a high surface energy with air, and so it will quickly pop. But all that changes when you add a surfactant like sodium lauryl sulfate to the mix. The surfactant's molecules will easily collect in the thin film of water that surrounds the bubble, lowering the surface energy of the liquid so much that the liquid film becomes relatively stable. As you massage the shampoo into your hair, these more resilient bubbles will keep forming, resulting in a buildup of foam. Because the surfactant is simultaneously gathering up all the oil and grease, we associate the cleaning with the foaming and judge the effectiveness of a shampoo by its foaminess. Modern ads stress this, but the foam does not help the shampoo to clean more thoroughly. Its role is purely aesthetic.

Sodium lauryl sulfate and its family of surfactants work so well and are so cheap that they've found their way into pretty much every type of cleaning product. They aren't just in shampoo, but also in cleaning liquids, laundry detergents, and even toothpastes — that's why your mouth fills with foam when you brush your teeth. Again, the role of the foam is purely for show —  Look, I'm cleaning my teeth! it says. Because of its success, sodium lauryl sulfate ultimately supplanted bars of soap as the main way to wash the rest of the body in the shower — it heralded the advent of so-called body washes. They were distributed, just like shampoos, in small bottles and squeezy containers. And because the sodium lauryl sulfate family of surfactants is transparent, these products look great in transparent bottles, especially if you color them and scent them, as you might do for shampoo.

The appeal of body washes wasn't just aesthetic, though. When you're in the shower or the bath, bars of soap have disadvantages. As soon as they're wet, they become incredibly slippery. If you're taking a bath in an area with hard water, and you're using a bar of soap, not only do you end up sitting in scum water as the soap reacts with the calcium in the water, but you also risk losing the soap altogether if it slips from your hand into the cloudy water. And if you're in the shower when the soap slips out of your hand, it usually shoots off, pinging its way around the tub like a ricocheting bullet, potentially landing underfoot, where you might step on it, lose your balance, slip, and brain yourself. Not so with shower gel.

Shower gel also has the advantage of being contained within a bottle. Bar soap has to sit somewhere, usually on an exposed surface, where it sloughs off its outer skin of foam and slimy scum, giving it an unappealing, and certainly not very telegenic, appearance — unlike liquid soaps, which maintain their media-friendly appeal through every use. And even once it's dry again, bar soap never quite returns to its pleasing appearance straight from the wrapper; after just one use, the bar is misshapen.


洗发水与沐浴露里的神秘成分

显然，我们很在意衣服是否干净，但我们也会想要一头干净、光亮，还散发着清香的秀发，那就接着谈谈洗发水吧。英语中「洗发水」一词源于印度，它指的是一种使用油脂和乳液进行的头部按摩。这种做法在殖民地时期传入英国，最终，它变为表示一种洗头方式。第一款现代洗发水出现在 20 世纪 30 年代，由宝洁公司生产，商品名为「德娜」（Drene）。德娜采用的是一种新型的液态表面活性剂，温和不刺激。这款产品用玻璃瓶包装，瓶身上贴有绿色与紫色相间的标签。与此同时，宝洁公司后来的主要竞争对手 —— 联合利华开始创业。这两家跨国公司之间的竞争，推动了清洁剂的创新。

如果你去观察一瓶现代洗发水的成分，很可能会发现一种叫作十二烷基硫酸钠的物质，或是它的近亲十二烷基聚醚硫酸钠。它们是构成现代洗发水的基本成分，都是非常有效的表面活性剂，不会与水中的钙离子发生强烈的相互作用，因此不会形成浮沫。除此以外，它们还能形成泡沫，这是我们认为洗发水不可缺少的特征。总之，它们非常非常好用。

十二烷基硫酸钠。注意亲水的头部与亲油的尾部

当你使用洗发水的时候，泡沫会随着你的揉搓而产生，你涂抹头发时，空气被扯入水中。空气试图从水中逸出，当它到达液体表面时，就会形成一个气泡。如果你不使用任何表面活性剂直接清洗你的头发，泡沫就只是一层薄薄的纯水膜，与空气之间存在着很高的表面能，所以它会很快破裂。但是，当你在混合物中加入十二烷基硫酸钠这样的表面活性剂时，一切都发生了改变。表面活性剂分子很容易聚集在包围气泡的那层薄水膜中，显著降低液体的表面能，使液膜变得相对稳定。当你把洗发水涂抹在头发上时，更多富有弹性的泡泡还会继续形成，最终形成一大片泡沫。由于表面活性剂同时聚集了所有的油脂，我们便会将清洁与泡沫联系起来，并通过起泡的状况来判断洗发水的效果。现代广告总是会强调这一点，但是泡沫并没有帮助洗发水实现更彻底的清洗，它所扮演的角色纯粹只在于审美层面。

十二烷基硫酸钠以及同系列表面活性剂的性能十分出色，价格也非常便宜，以至于它们几乎能在所有的清洁产品中占得一席之地。它们不仅存在于洗发水中，洗碗液、洗衣粉甚至牙膏中也能看到它们的身影，所以你在刷牙时嘴里会充满泡沫。同样，这些泡沫纯粹只是为了展示「看，我正在刷牙」。十二烷基硫酸钠最终取代了肥皂块，而且不只被用于洗头发，还成为人们沐浴时清洗其他部位的主要成分，这便催生了沐浴露。它们就像洗发水一样，被分装在小瓶子和按压式的容器中。因为十二烷基硫酸钠系列表面活性剂是透明的，所以它们在透明的瓶子里看起来很上档次，尤其是当它们像洗发水那样被上色添香之后。

不过，沐浴露的吸引力并不只是在美观上。当你沐浴或泡澡的时候，肥皂块有个缺点：一旦它湿了，就会变得非常滑。如果你在一个水质偏硬的地区洗澡，还用着一块肥皂，那么，当肥皂与水中的钙发生反应后，你会坐在充满浮沫的水中，如果肥皂从你的手里滑入浑浊的水中，你还有可能再也找不回这块肥皂。当你洗澡的时候，肥皂从你的手上滑落，它通常会像一颗跳弹般发射出去，然后在浴盆里「砰砰」作响，说不定还会降落在你可能踩到的地方，让你失去平衡，狠狠地摔上一跤。沐浴露可不是这样。

沐浴露被装在瓶子中，这也是它的一个优势。肥皂块必须放置在某个地方，通常是暴露在外的面板上。在那里，它外部的泡沫表皮和黏糊糊的浮沫开始剥落，这让它看起来丑丑的，不是很上镜，不像洗手液可以在每次使用后依然保持光鲜亮丽。即使再次变干，肥皂的外观也不会完全恢复，只要被使用了一次，肥皂就变形了。

## 8.5 Hand sanitizer enters thousands of households

In the 1980s a company called Minnetonka started thinking about ways of bringing liquid soap out of the shower and onward to bathroom and kitchen sinks. But they knew the product needed to feel different — it couldn't be like shampoo or body wash, and certainly not like cleaning liquid — even though it would, in fact, be very similar. They had to sell it to people as new, and entirely appealing. They hit on the idea of pump dispensers, and that turned out to be a stroke of genius. Anyone who had previously worried about picking up a bar of wet soap, which had already been used by the previous person in the bathroom, could now enjoy the experience of having pristine detergent dispensed straight into the palm. The concept didn't catch on right away, though. Not everyone was impressed — for some it seemed to be an overly complicated solution to a non-problem. Others agreed with me — they didn't like the sensation that a small animal was pissing on their hand.

But if the public felt ambivalent about liquid soaps in the 1980s, the 1990s tipped the balance firmly in their favor: a bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus , which typically infects wounds after surgery, had, over time, developed strains that resisted antibiotics, making them very hard to treat. These strains were first discovered in the 1960s, but by the 1990s Staphylococcus aureus resistant to treatment by the antibiotic methicillin had become an epidemic in hospitals. In the UK, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections accounted for 50 percent of all hospital infections. There were similarly high rates across Europe and the United States, leading to a sharp increase in hospital mortality. By 2006, the UK had seen two thousand deaths due to MRSA, and hospitals were struggling to deal with the spread of the bacteria. Fortunately, thanks to stricter handwashing regimens — in particular, requiring nurses and doctors to wash their hands after contact with patients — the rate of death has gone down over the past decade.

Outside the hospital, though, a public-health campaign began, extolling the benefits of clean hands, and it hinged on the promotion of antibacterial soaps, which, along with sodium lauryl sulfate and its cousin molecules, contain agents like triclosan, an antimicrobial molecule. These soaps were marketed as superior to traditional soap at preventing the spread of germs. The marketing was successful — the demand for antibacterial soaps was enormous, despite the fact that no evidence proved that they were more efficacious than conventional soap and water. In fact, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has said that certain antimicrobial soaps may not actually provide any health benefits at all.

「Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,」she said in an official statement.「In fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm than good over the long term.」

In 2016, antibacterial soaps were banned in the United States. But since then, liquid soaps have infiltrated everywhere. Stripped of their antibacterial agents, liquid soaps now account for the majority of soaps bought in the UK and the USA. They're still in our hospitals, our homes, and yes, our airplane lavatories, where I was now spurting some into my hand.

Bong, went the plane's intercom.

「This is the captain speaking. We're about to encounter some turbulence, so I've put on the FASTEN SEAT BELT sign. Would all passengers please return to their seats. Thank you.」

Being addressed while you're in the lavatory feels a bit strange. Prior to that moment, I'd had a feeling of complete privacy, but that was shattered by a sense that the captain had just popped his head round the door. The paranoid part of my brain even considered that the announcement might just have been a ploy to get me out of the lavatory, where I'd been spending so much time reading the ingredients on the back of the liquid-soap bottle.

The liquid soap I was using did in fact contain sodium laureth sulfate. Most likely it was made from palm kernel oil or coconut oil. These trees flourish in tropical climates and have become incredibly important to the global economy because they are easy to grow and have a high yield of oil, making them stable and profitable crops for countries with a suitable climate. Fifty million tons of palm oil are produced annually, and that goes into everything from cakes to cosmetics — next time you're in a supermarket, take a look at the ingredients of cookies, cakes, chocolate, cereal, and on and on. You will very likely find palm oil in all of them.

A sketch of the structure of lauric acid, which is often obtained from palm kernel oil.

Palm kernel oil is particularly useful for making liquid soap because of its unusual chemical composition. It contains a lot of lauric acid, a twelve-carbon-chain molecule with a carboxylic acid group at the end. It looks a lot like a surfactant, but without a charged end. That's easily fixed, though, chemically speaking. Its size is what is important. Lauric acid, when used to make a surfactant, creates a hydrocarbon molecule that's much smaller than the ones found in normal soap, which are typically eighteen carbon atoms long.

Lauric acid, being smaller itself, produces a smaller surfactant and is lighter and more effective as a foaming agent. In fact, it's almost too good. Our delight with these liquid soaps has led to a huge increase in their production, and thus in the demand for palm oil and coconut oil. As a result, large sections of the rainforest in the countries where the oils are made, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, have been cut down; their immense biodiversity has been replaced with a monoculture of palm trees. This has all sorts of negative impacts, not least among them the destruction of habitat for wild animals, many of them already endangered, and the displacement of indigenous communities, who have been marginalized for centuries. Such is the demand for liquid soaps, though, and for the other products made of palm oil, that this process continues.

And to add insult to injury, detergents made with sodium laureth sulfate, which we go to such lengths to make, can actually work too well for some people. They remove fats and oils so well that they cause skin irritation, such as eczema and dermatitis. To prevent this, liquid-soap manufacturers add modifiers and moisturizers to their soaps, which replace the natural oils that the sodium laureth sulfate pulls out of your skin. You could almost be glad, then, that most of the liquid soap that's used just ends up going down the sink, without even interacting with your hands. Liquid-soap manufacturers have tried to address this by increasing the viscosity of the soap, and also by creating dispensers that squirt the soap out not as a liquid, but as a pre-formulated foam, which is more useful. The foam dispensers are actually rather good, not just because they dispense the tiny amount of surfactant you need, along with a lot of air, but also because they've finally created an active use for foam. It's not just aesthetic, as it is in shampoos, body washes, and toothpastes. In foam dispensers, the foam is the medium that carries the surfactant to your hands.

All in all, liquid soaps, of varying sorts, have become a hundred-billion-dollar industry. We rely on detergents to keep ourselves clean and scented, to keep our clothes clean and scented, to keep our hair clean and scented, to wash our dishes, and, perhaps most important in a highly populated world, to keep ourselves healthy and to stop the spread of disease — using soap is one of the most powerful ways to do this. But when we buy liquid soaps, we're mostly paying for their marketing; the essential ingredients of detergents, the ones that do the cleaning, are cheap — all the more reason to consider how these products are being made, and their impact on forests in the tropics.

Me, I love a bar of soap. It's hand-sized, and washing with it gives me the feeling of material contact, which I find reassuring and comforting. Yes, bars of soap are hard to market, but that's part of what I like about them — you buy a bar of soap because you need it, not because you think it's going to make you into a different, more successful, more desirable or sexy person.

The airplane was now rocking and bouncing around in an alarming manner. There was a sharp tap on the door, and a flight attendant asked me if I was OK. I worried for a moment that I might have been in the lavatory for hours, ranting to myself about the rise of liquid soap, but then I realized the attendant was referring to the turbulence. Time to get back to my seat, I thought.

But before I left the cubicle, I hesitated, my hand hovering by the second bottle by the sink. This contained another liquid, a moisturizer. Why was it there? Do we really need to moisturize our hands every time we wash them? Is this also part of the increasing pressure to consume products, regardless of whether we really need them — making soaps that clean hands too well, and then providing the antidote, a moisturizing cream? Or was I just being paranoid? I tried a squirt of it anyway; it was a nice-looking bottle, and I found the lemony fresh scent ridiculously hard to resist.


洗手液走进千家万户

20 世纪 80 年代，一家名为「迷你唐卡」（Minnetonka）的公司开始考虑如何将洗手液从浴室带进厕所与厨房。但他们知道，这款新产品需要让人眼前一亮，它不能像洗发水或沐浴露那样，当然也不能像洗衣液，尽管事实上它们都是非常相似的产品。他们只能将它作为一种全新的、富有诱惑力的产品销售给大众，并突发灵感想到了抽水机的概念，结果证明，这是一个天才的创意。过去那些担心在厕所里拿起一块湿肥皂却发现已经被他人用过的人，现在可以享受一种看似原始的体验，那就是直接将洗手液挤到他们的手掌中。不过，它并没能立即流行起来，并不是每个人都对此印象深刻。一些人认为，这似乎是对一个不是问题的问题提出了一个过于复杂的解决方案。其他一些包括我在内的人，如前所述，不喜欢这种让人联想到小宠物在自己手上撒尿的感觉。

不过，如果说在 20 世纪 80 年代，大众对洗手液的态度还有些暧昧不明的话，那么，20 世纪 90 年代出现的新情况让他们决定使用洗手液。一种被称为金黄色葡萄球菌的细菌，通常会感染手术后的患者，而且随着时间的推移，这种细菌产生了能够耐受抗生素的菌株，因此变得异常棘手。这些菌株最初是在 20 世纪 60 年代被发现的，但是到了 90 年代，在抗生素甲氧西林治疗过程产生耐受作用的金黄色葡萄球菌，已经成为一种流行病。在英国，耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌（MRSA）感染问题，占医院里所有感染病例的 50%，而在欧洲与美国也出现了类似的高感染率，导致病人的死亡率急剧上升。到 2006 年，英国已经有 2 000 多人死于这一感染，医院也在竭尽全力阻止这种细菌的传播。幸运的是，由于更严格的洗手制度出现，特别是要求护士与医生在与病人接触后务必洗手，因此在过去的 10 年里，由耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌造成的死亡率已经下降了。

然而在医院以外，一场公共卫生运动开始了，旨在宣扬洗手的好处，而它的关键作用在于促进了抗菌肥皂的发展。这种肥皂除了含有十二烷基硫酸钠以及和它相似的分子以外，还含有诸如三氯生这类抗菌分子。消费者往往认为，这些肥皂比传统肥皂更能阻断细菌的传播。这说明抗菌肥皂的市场营销非常成功，尽管没有任何证据表明它在抗菌效果上比普通肥皂和水更好，但是抗菌肥皂的市场需求十分庞大。事实上，美国食品与药品监督管理局药物评估与研究中心主任珍妮特·伍德科克（Janet Woodcock）博士说，某些抗菌肥皂对于健康而言，可能没有任何实际好处。

她在一份声明中提到：「消费者可能认为抗菌洗涤用品在预防细菌传播方面更有效，但我们没有科学证据证明它们比普通肥皂和水更好。事实上，有一些数据表明，从长远来看，抗菌成分可能弊大于利。」

2016 年，抗菌肥皂在美国被禁止使用，但是在当时，洗手液已经渗透到了每个角落。不添加抗菌剂成分的洗手液，如今在英国人与美国人购买的肥皂中占了很大比例，它们依然出现在我们的医院、家庭，当然还有飞机上的厕所里，而我此刻正朝自己的手上挤了一些。

「当当 ——」飞机广播此时响了起来：

「我是本架飞机的机长。我们正要穿过一段气流，机上系紧安全带的标志灯已经打开，请所有乘客回到自己的座位上，谢谢合作。」

在厕所里与别人说话时，会感觉有些奇怪。在这之前，我还有一种完全私密感，而这种私密感却在广播响起的那一刻突然烟消云散，就仿佛机长刚刚把头探进门来似的。我甚至偏执地认为，这一通知或许只是一个让我走出厕所的花招，因为我已经在厕所里花了太多时间阅读洗手液瓶子背面的成分表。

我用的洗手液其实含有十二烷基聚醚硫酸钠，很可能是由棕榈仁油或椰子油制成的。这些树木生长在热带气候环境中，对于全球经济来说有着极其重要的意义。因为它们易于生长，还可以产出大量的植物油，因此对于气候适宜的各国来说，都是稳定而又收益颇丰的经济作物。全球每年会生产 5 000 万吨棕榈油，它们应用在从蛋糕到化妆品的各个领域。下次当你在超市时，看看饼干、蛋糕、巧克力、谷类食品等商品的配料表，你很可能在所有这些商品中发现棕榈油的存在。

棕榈仁油因其特殊的化学成分，特别适合用于制造洗手液。它含有很多十二烷酸，分子由 12 个碳原子的碳链构成，末端是一个羧基。它看起来很像是表面活性剂，但是没有带电荷的一段。不过，从化学角度来说，这很容易解决。它的大小才是最重要的，当十二烷酸被用于制造表面活性剂时，它会产生一个比普通肥皂短得多的分子链，后者通常有 18 个碳原子之长。

十二烷酸的结构式，它也叫月桂酸，可以从棕榈仁油中提取

十二烷酸分子相对较小，形成的表面活性剂也就更小，而且正因为它更小，所以更轻，作为发泡剂也更有效。事实上，这简直堪称完美。我们对洗手液的喜爱，已经促使它们的产量激增，这也导致了人们对棕榈油和椰子油的需求大幅增长。而在马来西亚和印度尼西亚等油料产地，这又导致了大片热带雨林被砍伐，单一种植的棕榈树取代了丰富的生物多样性。这会带来各种各样的负面影响，不只是破坏野生动物栖息地并导致很多动物濒临灭绝，已经被边缘化数个世纪之久的原住民部族也流离失所。然而，如果对洗手液以及棕榈油其他用途的需求不减，这一进程仍会继续。

雪上加霜的是，我们耗费很长时间来制造这些由十二烷基聚醚硫酸钠制成的洗涤剂也就罢了，实际上对于有些人来说，它们好得有些过分了。它们能够有效地去除油脂，因而会刺激皮肤，引发皮肤疾病，比如湿疹和皮炎。为了防止这种情况发生，洗手液的制造商只好在它们的肥皂产品中加入调节剂和保湿剂，避免十二烷基聚醚硫酸钠从你的皮肤中吸取天然油脂。于是，你可能会很高兴，你所使用的大多数洗手液，最终都流进了水槽，甚至不会和你的手发生作用。洗手液制造商试图通过增加液体黏度来解决这一问题，还推出了分配器将清洁剂挤出，挤出来的不是液体，而是预先配制的泡沫，这倒是更有用一些。泡沫分配器实际上非常有效，不仅是因为它们分配了你所需的少量表面活性剂以及大量空气，更是因为它们最终为泡沫创造了重要的用途。不像洗发水、沐浴露或牙膏那样只关乎审美，在泡沫分配器中，泡沫是将表面活性剂输送到你手中的介质。

总之，各种洗手液已经成为一项价值千亿美元的产业。我们依靠清洁剂来保持个人的卫生与清新，当然还有我们的衣服和头发。我们用洗涤剂清洗我们的盘子，或许最重要的是，在人口稠密的社会里，这是我们保持健康并阻止疾病传播的最有效方法之一。但是，当我们购买洗手液的时候，却主要是为它们的营销买单。清洁剂的基本成分，也就是那些发挥清洁作用的组分，其实是最便宜的。这就让我们更有理由去关心产品如何制造，以及它们对热带雨林的负面影响。

至于我，我是喜欢肥皂块的。它的尺寸和手一样大，用它清洗的时候，会给我一种与实物接触的感觉，让我感到安心而舒适。没错，肥皂很难占领市场，但这也是我喜欢它的一部分理由。你买肥皂是因为你需要它，而不是因为你认为，它会让你成为一个与众不同、出类拔萃、很受欢迎或性感火辣的人。

此刻，这架飞机正以一种令人不安的方式摇晃不定。门外传来一阵尖锐的敲击声，乘务员问我是否还安好。我为此担心了好一会儿，我可能已经在厕所待了几个小时，因为洗手液的问题自怨自艾。但我很快意识到，他们担心的是湍流。我想，是时候回到自己的座位上了。不过在离开厕所之前我还是犹豫了一下，手掌在水槽边的第二个瓶子上摩挲。这里面装着另一种液体，一种保湿剂。它为什么会出现在那里？我们真的需要在每一次洗完手之后都进行手部保湿吗？它们是不是增加消费压力的帮凶，却不管我们是否真的需要这些产品呢？它们难道可以让肥皂更有效地将手洗干净，然后提供保湿霜作为一种「解毒剂」？或者说，我只是一个偏执狂？不管怎么样，我试着从中挤出来一点。这是一个很好看的瓶子，有柠檬的清香气味，我难以抗拒。
