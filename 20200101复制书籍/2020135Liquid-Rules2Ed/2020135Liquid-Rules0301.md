THE WATER IN MY plastic bottle was quite different from the water in the ocean I could see through my oval airplane window. The differences weren't just in composition — their respective salt contents and so on — but also in behavior. Earth's oceans are in a constant state of flux: they both create winds and are driven by them; they make the clouds and our weather systems, and are driven by them; they heat up the atmosphere, but also store heat. Huge global currents are established inside the oceans, and these affect our climate. Thus, despite being made of roughly the same molecules, the oceans that cover 70 percent of our planet are not just giant versions of the water in a bottle. They are utterly different beasts.

And beast is probably the right word to describe them. The oceans are dangerous, no matter how competent a swimmer you might be; keeping afloat in the open ocean is extremely difficult for more than a few hours at a time. My advice, if you do find yourself stranded at sea, is not to exhaust yourself trying to battle the currents; instead, float on your back while you await rescue. Though, in my opinion, floating is really the wrong word to describe what happens when humans bob about in the water. Floating is what boats do. They are majestic; they cruise along with just a small portion of their bulk submerged. Whenever I try to「float,」most of my body sinks; if I'm lucky, I can just about keep my nose poking out of the water while I snort like a whale, breathing in air while simultaneously trying, and usually failing, to keep water from getting up my nose. Real floating, in my view, entails not just resting on top of water, but doing so with ease. But that's not the standard definition, and it's certainly not what Archimedes meant when he discovered the principle of floating two thousand years ago, and famously shouted「Eureka!」in his bathtub.

Archimedes was a Greek mathematician and engineer. He noticed that when you get into a bath, the water level goes up. The reason is obvious enough; you're sitting where some of the water used to be. It doesn't get compressed underneath you like a foam mattress would; instead, because it is a liquid, it flows around you and finds somewhere else to go. In the contained space of a tub, the only place for it to go is above the initial water level. If the bath is already full when you get in, then the water will flow over the edge of the tub and onto the floor. This is where Archimedes' famous experiment comes in. By collecting the water that spills over the edge in another vessel, it tells you something interesting: the weight of that water equals the so-called buoyancy force acting on you. If that force is lower than your weight, you will sink; otherwise you will float. This applies to any object. Eureka!

Why some things float and others sink comes down to whether they weigh more than their equivalent volume of water.

What Archimedes had discovered is that you can predict whether something will float or sink by simply working out the weight of water it will displace. For solid stuff you just have to compare the density of the material to the density of water. Thus wood, which weighs less per volume than water, is less dense than water, and so it floats. Steel is denser than water, so it sinks. But there is a trick: you can still make ships of steel if you make them hollow. Then their average density can be less than that of water, and so they float. It's as simple as that. Fast-forward two thousand years from Archimedes' heyday, and we find that the price of steel is now low enough for us to actually be able to build ships this way; our current maritime shipping fleet, which carries 90 percent of the world's traded goods, is made up almost entirely of steel ships.

The human body is composed of materials of varying density: there are dense bones and less dense tissue, and in some places we are hollow. Overall we're a bit less dense than water, which is why we can float. But if you adjust your density to exactly match the water's, by wearing something heavy — a metal belt, for instance — you'll be in a state of neither sinking nor floating; you're neutrally buoyant, the ideal state for scuba diving. When you're neutrally buoyant underwater, there's no net force trying to make you float to the surface, nor is there a force making you sink to the bottom of the ocean. In your scuba gear, you're effectively weightless, free to explore the coral reefs and sunken wrecks of the deep. It's so close to the feeling of weightlessness found in space that astronauts train in swimming pools.

Without the aid of scuba equipment, the human body floats. But our body is only slightly less dense than water, so more than 90 percent of it needs to be submerged in order to displace enough water to support our weight. Fatter people are more buoyant than thinner people because their fat-to-bone ratio makes them less dense. Wetsuits also make you more buoyant — they're coating you in a significant layer of material that is less dense than water. It's a little bit easier to float in the sea than it is in a swimming pool because the sea has minerals dissolved in it, such as salt, or so dium chloride. The sodium and the chlorine get inside the liquid by splitting up and inserting themselves between the water molecules. Having these atoms inside it makes the water more dense, so you don't need to displace quite so much water to counter your weight as you would in pure water. In fact, the Dead Sea in the Middle East has so much salt in it (ten times as much as the Atlantic Ocean) that you can bob around like a duck right on top of it.

Once you can float, you can swim: one of life's greatest pleasures. In water, not only are you weightless, but you can glide like a dancer. There's a hidden world lying just under the surface. Forget the expense of going to Mars and the excitement of searching for life on other planets — the oceans are, in all practical respects, alien worlds for us. By donning a pair of goggles and ducking underwater with a quick kick of the legs, we can visit them. Gliding down to the turquoise depths of a coral reef is one of the most wondrous things you can ever do. The fish observe you with weary eyes and flick their tails to swerve expertly out of your way. When you swim, you reach forward with one arm outstretched; by pulling it back, you cause the liquid around you to move rapidly enough to prevent the water molecules from moving past one another, so they jam together, exerting a force on you. It's that force that propels you forward in the opposite direction. This is the essence of swimming — your arms and your legs are constantly moving the water behind you, which has the effect of pushing you forward. It's not just thrilling; you essentially become a different person. Whereas on land you might be clumsy and plodding, in the water you can whirl and glide like a dolphin: you're free.

I used to live in a neighborhood in Dublin called Dun Laoghaire, within walking distance of a swimming spot called the Forty Foot, a rocky promontory in Dublin Bay famous for being featured in James Joyce's Ulysses, and home for centuries to a swimming club. I stopped by on a winter's day in 1999, and I saw people of all ages, but mostly senior citizens, jumping into the sea for a swim. The air temperature was perhaps 54ºF, and the sea was about 50ºF. I was wearing a big overcoat, and still I felt a bit cold as the winds from the Irish Sea buffeted me and the waves jumped up at the concrete quayside. Yet here were the elderly, who might be advised by their doctors to wrap up warm, jumping into the freezing waters. I got talking to a few of them as they dried themselves off afterward. They were happy and smiling and delighted. Their teeth chattered with the cold, but they were clearly elated. They told me that they swam every day of the year, in cold weather just as in warm — although, as I discovered in my time working there, Ireland rarely gets truly warm.

I decided to join them and bought a swimming cap that very same day. I swam in the Forty Foot every week of the year from then on. Looking back, it's one of the things I miss most about living in Dublin. But why did I love it so much?

Diving into water that is 50ºF is not a comforting feeling. It is more like a slap in the face. It's not that the temperature is so extremely cold, but that you're surrounding your skin in water that's a good forty degrees colder than your skin. The water molecules draw heat away. But since liquids are denser than gases, there are many more molecules interacting with your skin per second than when you're just exposed to the air, so the heat conduction away from your warm skin is that much more extreme.

What makes it feel worse is another characteristic of water, called heat capacity. When water molecules are exposed to something hot, they jig about faster. These vibrations are what we call temperature. So the faster they go, the hotter the water gets. The hydrogen bonds holding the water molecules together strongly resist this vibration, so it takes a lot of heat to increase the average temperature of a quart of water molecules by even just one degree. To put this in perspective, it takes ten times more energy to heat up water than it does to heat up the same weight of copper. This feature of water, its exceptional heat capacity, explains why it takes so much heat to make a cup of tea. It also explains why an electric kettle is typically the most energy-intensive gadget in the kitchen. But that's just one of many ways in which water's high heat capacity — the highest of any liquid except ammonia — affects us. It's also what allows the oceans to store a lot of heat, and so their temperature always lags behind that of the air. Hence, on a sunny day in Dublin, the air temperature might heat up to 72ºF, while the sea temperature will hardly change from 50ºF. Sadly, for Irish people, this means that the sea never really warms up from the summer sun before winter comes again to cool it down. But it is a major advantage for us as a species because the high heat capacity of the oceans allows them to absorb a lot of the excess heat brought about by climate change. In other words, the oceans are stabilizing our climate, keeping us warm in the winter and cooling us down in the summer.

But none of that really explains why I enjoy swimming in the cold sea. I'm not one of those hardy outdoor types who relish being cold and wet. I'm a scientist and engineer, and I spend most of my time inside a laboratory or a workshop. Maybe that's the point — the sea is so marvelously wild and unpredictable that perhaps, unconsciously, I just want to expose myself to something utterly different from my day-to-day life. When you dive into the cold sea, you have to swim, to be alive and alert; it is so uncomfortable that it forces you out of a conscious rational mindset. It's impossible to worry about your failed experiments, unsubstantiated theories, or even your bungled relationships when you're gasping for breath — the very breath that is knocked out of you because you chose to dive into forbidding, uncontrollable waters.

Hypothermia is always at the back of your mind when you're swimming in cold water. Hypothermia sets in when your core temperature drops below 95ºF. You start shivering uncontrollably and your skin changes color as your surface blood vessels contract, diverting blood toward your major organs. First you go pale, then your extremities turn blue. In very cold waters, the shock can cause uncontrolled rapid breathing, gasping, and a massive increase in heart rate that can lead to panic, confusion, and drowning. But even if you remain calm, swimming in 32ºF water for just fifteen minutes will be fatal, as hypothermia sets in and shuts down your muscles.

Ultimately, I think it was that cold hand of death that drew me to the Forty Foot on all those icy gray January mornings, when the water temperature was, on average, 50ºF. It made me feel more alive to be that close to death, to tease it, and then get out of the water and walk away unscathed.

Well, mostly unscathed. One day things didn't go so well for me. I arrived at the Forty Foot on a Saturday in February and found it deserted. The usual cadre of senior citizens was not in evidence. The tide was high and the water was choppy, with the occasional big wave coming in and launching itself onto the quay where I was changing into my swimming trunks. I was shivering, and my skin was covered in goose pimples from the cold winds. I was ready to jump, but hesitated before looking out at the water. I had never swum here alone before and the sea was rougher than I'd yet experienced. Maybe, I thought, this is why no one else is swimming today? Seconds of doubt elapsed. I remember goading myself, thinking, Am I really so scared that, after going to the trouble of changing into my swimming trunks, I'm not even going to swim? I dived in.

I felt the usual slap in the face, the sense that my body was under attack, that the ocean was sucking the life out of me. I always dealt with this by swimming energetically, so off I went, out to sea, fighting the waves coming toward me and trying to ignore the intense cold seeping into my limbs. I made it out a fair way before stopping to take a breather and getting hit smack in the face by a wave. I swallowed a mouthful of water, coughed, spluttered, and then took a deep breath, only to be hit in the face again. This time I choked. Water had gone down my windpipe, and I started thrashing out in an attempt to rise far enough out of the water to breathe properly, even if for just a couple of seconds. I couldn't do it, though; the water was too rough and the waves kept beating me down. I panicked, and began hyperventilating, while desperately kicking my legs to keep myself from drowning. Then another big wave hit me, and my panic turned to exhaustion. I couldn't win; I was cold and dead tired.

That's when I hit the rocks. While I'd been choking — for how long, I do not know — the waves and the tide had been pushing me toward the rocks that buttressed the Forty Foot and protected it from winter storms. These rocks, each the size of a small car, had been dropped into place by a crane to form a harbor barrier. Being washed up against rocks like that is normally something to avoid. It's nearly impossible to control the speed at which you'll hit them — that's almost entirely determined by the size, height, and speed of the waves carrying you — so it can be incredibly dangerous. But still, at that moment, I was relieved; hitting the rocks left me with a fair number of cuts and bruises, but it also gave me a chance to escape. Not that it was easy — as the waves that smashed me into the rocks receded, they pulled me away from the shore too. It took three or four waves and a good deal of scrapping, scratching, and bleeding for me to get a hold firm enough to allow me to climb up and finally escape from the sea.

I have relived this episode of my life many times, more often than not when I'm gazing out at the extreme implacable beauty of the ocean. But up here in the airplane, from my vantage point at forty thousand feet, the helplessness I'd felt at the time was magnified. I knew I could have drowned that day if I had swallowed one more wave, or if the tide had taken me out to sea rather than into the rocks. Many people die in similar circumstances. I knew I had been stupid. The ocean's ability to swallow you up without a trace is laid frighteningly bare when you look out at its harsh, seemingly endless expanse from the stratosphere. I turned to Susan, to see if she might be up for some sort of chat about oceans, waves, and ac cidental drowning, but she was wrapped up in a blanket with her knees pressed to her chest, watching some sort of sci-fi movie. The screen showed a picture of a spaceship moving into orbit around an enormous planet.

Size matters when it comes to bodies of water. When wind blows over a small pond, this creates friction, which slows the wind down and pushes against the water. This causes a depression in the water's surface. The surface tension of the water resists this change much as a rubber band resists being extended. Once that puff of wind ceases, just as with a rubber band, the release of tension, along with the force of gravity, restores the surface to its original form. As that water descends, a ripple is generated that radiates outward, as each water molecule displaces another, which, in turn, displaces still another, and so on. A ripple in water is really a pulse of energy. Energy, having originated from the wind, is now stuck on the surface of the pond. It makes the surface of the pond rougher, and so increases the resistance to the wind flowing over its surface. Thus, the ripple is joined by others, and they're pushed higher and higher. The higher the ripples, the greater the restoring force pulling them back down again, and so the rougher the pond becomes. There is a limit, though, to how high these ripples can go; eventually they'll hit the edge of the pond, and most of their energy will be absorbed by the land. But the longer they travel, the higher they'll get, which is why in a small pond ripples are never very big, but in a lake they can become so big that the wind will turn them into waves.

The top of a wave is called its peak and the bottom is called the trough. The distance between them is what we refer to when we talk about the size of a wave. As long as the size of the wave is smaller than the depth of the lake it's in, then the wave will travel uninhibitedly. But as the wave approaches the shallower waters at the shore, the trough will start to interact with the bottom of the lake, causing a kind of friction that will slow the wave down and force it to break, leaving it lapping on the beach.

In an ocean thousands of miles wide, those initial ripples have the time and space to grow to several feet in height. Wind blowing over the surface of the ocean for two hours at twelve miles per hour can make waves 12 inches high. A wind blowing at thirty miles per hour for a whole day can make waves 13 feet high. And a storm wind blowing for three or four days at forty-seven miles per hour can make 26-foot-high waves. The largest wave of this sort, recorded during a typhoon off the seas of Taiwan in 2007, reached 105 feet in height.

The waves produced during storms don't stop when the storm abates. Like ripples in a pond, they travel across the ocean, which is when their length becomes important. The length of a wave is the distance from its peak to the peak of the next wave. In a stormy ocean, it's hard to determine length because all the waves are jumbled on top of one another; a rough sea looks like a moving morass of angry water. When the storm ends, though, the waves carry on their way, and because they all have different lengths, they also have different speeds. So, as the waves travel across hundreds of miles of ocean, they separate out into sets, based on which ones are moving at similar speeds. Within the sets, the waves align, so that they run parallel. Eventually, each set will arrive at the coast in an ordered and regular pattern. Thus, the crash of waves onto the beach is essentially the sound of a storm that's come from very far away. That beautiful hypnotic rhythm comes from the complexities of ocean dynamics.

Given that storm waves are generated all over the ocean, it is a bit surprising that they usually approach land perpendicular to the beach. Surely, you might think, they should approach land at an angle determined by the straight line between the beach and whichever place in the ocean the waves were generated. But no, waves are too tricky for that. As a wave travels across deep water, its speed remains constant, because there's almost nothing that can slow it down. But as it approaches land, the water gets shallower, and the trough starts to interact with the seabed, slowing down that part of the wave. Meanwhile, the parts of the wave that have not yet encountered shallow water carry on at the same speed. The difference in speeds turns the wave in the same way that braking on one wheel of a car changes its direction. The net result: as waves approach land, they turn so that they are parallel to the contours of the seabed, which tend to run perpendicular to the beach, and thus most waves approach the shore from the same direction.

Surfers all know this. They also know about shoaling, which is what makes surfing such an exciting sport. Imagine you're sitting on your surfboard, looking out to sea; what you really want to know is where and when the waves are going to break. As the waves come closer to shore, they slow down because they encounter shallow water, but that also increases their height. This is shoaling. The shallower the water gets, the higher the wave gets, until the steepness of the wave reaches a critical angle where it becomes unstable. It's become so steep, you can slide down it on a surfboard, as if you were skiing down a mountain slope.

Surfing requires balance, timing, and an understanding of how waves behave. If you want to surf along a wave, you need part of the wave to start breaking before the rest. This means you need the contours of the seabed to slope gradually along the beach, because the moment a wave breaks is determined by the depth of the water it's moving through. You also need to understand the tides, which change the depth of the water throughout the day, based on the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.

In sum, to catch a wave, you need a storm out at sea to produce waves big enough to travel across the ocean, toward a beach with an appropriately shaped seabed. You need them to arrive at just the right time of day to align with the tide. Then, if you're there at exactly that moment, wetsuit on, surfboard in hand, and ready, you might catch a sweet wave to shore. The exquisite timing of this confluence of events is what makes surfing such a special sport — it requires surfers to be completely in tune with the storms out at sea, the sun, the moon, and the water they're riding.

Even if you're not a wave connoisseur, it's still worth knowing about shoaling because it could save your life. On the morning of December 26, 2004, tourists on Phuket Island in Thailand were walking on the beach when they noticed something odd. The sea was receding fast, exposing usually submerged rocks and leaving boats stranded in the bay. Children watched and wondered, and so did their parents, as a large wave suddenly appeared; they thought they'd never seen anything like it before. But of course, they had: this was the shoaling of a wave. Only this wave was enormous: a tsunami.

As it turns out, just a few hours earlier, in the middle of the Indian Ocean, part of Earth's crust had ruptured, causing an earthquake of magnitude 9.0. This is a massive earthquake by any standards. The energy released was estimated to be ten thousand times bigger than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Nevertheless, being that far out to sea, it didn't cause much immediate damage or loss of life. But the earthquake didn't just shear the tectonic plates of the crust — it also raised the seafloor by several feet. This, in turn, displaced approximately seven cubic miles of water. That's a lot of water — the equivalent of ten million Olympic swimming pools. And just as moving suddenly in the bath makes the water slosh back and forth, the earthquake set this enormous amount of water into motion.

Waves being waves, they set off across the ocean in all directions. If you'd been looking down from an aircraft at the moment the tsunami began, you probably wouldn't have been too worried. The waves were spread over such a large distance, and in such deep water, that only a small hump would have been discernible. But you might still have been alarmed by the speed at which they were traveling. Because of the intensity of the earthquake, and the vast amount of energy released over a short period of time, those waves traveled at the speed of a jet aircraft, about five hundred miles per hour. As they approached the coast and the shallow water of the Andaman Sea, they slowed down and got taller. The closer they got, the more the shoaling intensified. Because the waves were hundreds of feet long, the first thing the people on the beach noticed was the water being sucked out to sea. If they had recognized the phenomenon, they would have had about a minute to run to higher ground. But, tragically, most of them didn't know what was happening — unlike many of the animals near the beach, which seemed to sense that something strange was going on, and fled. Those who stayed were hit by the first wave, which was thirty feet high when it reached the shore.

The arrival of a tsunami wave.

All in all, the tsunami killed 227,898 people along the coastlines of fifteen countries. What makes a tsunami so dangerous is not just the vast amount of water it dumps on the coast, but the force that the water exerts on everything it meets. One gallon of water weighs 8.3 pounds, and the tsunami displaced eight trillion gallons of water. It ripped apart huts, trees, and cars, destroying them and thus creating a river of debris that smashed into everything it encountered. It swept up tankers, houses, and cars and flung them into bridges and overhead electricity pylons, which collapsed, creating lethal fires. The people who were pulled into the wave were carried along, bashed, tumbled, and crushed by all this fast-flowing debris. This knocked many of them unconscious or injured them in a way that hindered their ability to stay afloat. Just like storm waves, tsunamis come in sets, and as the first wave was pulled back (having reached more than a mile inland in places) by the approach of the second, the currents reversed and pulled the people and debris caught in their path into this new onslaught.

Unfortunately, those who were lucky enough to survive this devastation faced any number of challenges in its aftermath, water pollution being one of the most severe. The freshwater supplies in the areas hit by the tsunami had been poisoned by the destruction of sewers and the infiltration of saltwater; the hundreds of thousands of people struck dead by the waves all had to be buried as quickly as possible to prevent the spread of disease and pests; and longer-term infiltration of saltwater into the region's arable land left it unable to support crops.

But as catastrophic as the 2004 tsunami was, the one in 2011 off the coast of Japan was even more powerful. The tsunami was created by the force of an enormous earthquake — the fourth most powerful in recorded history — with an epicenter in the ocean, forty-three miles off the shore of Honshu, the largest island in the Japanese archipelago. Shaking was felt on land for six minutes, but the worst damage didn't occur until later, when the resulting tsunami hit the shore, devastating entire towns and colliding with the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Fukushima Daiichi was built in 1971 and had six nuclear fission reactors. These reactors are made up of rods of uranium oxide, which are bundled together inside the reactor core. A reactor emits radiation in the form of very high energy particles. In a nuclear power plant, most of this energy goes toward heating up water to create steam, which drives turbines, which in turn cre ate electricity. This type of nuclear energy is so powerful that a set of rods of uranium oxide the size of a small car will produce the amount of electricity needed to run a city of a million people for two years. Prior to the 2011 tsunami, the Fukushima plant had six of these reactors, all producing power twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, for approximately five million people.

Japan has a long history of earthquakes; it lies at the boundary between two major tectonic plates. The Fukushima plant was built to withstand these earthquakes, and indeed it did. As did Japan's other fifty-four nuclear reactors. When the earthquake occurred, on March 11, 2011, it didn't damage the plant at all. However, due to legally mandated safety precautions, three of the reactors (1, 2, and 3) all shut themselves down (reactors 4, 5, and 6 were already shut down for refueling). You can't just turn nuclear fuel「off.」It still gives out heat and radioactivity when the reactors are shut down. They need active cooling to prevent a meltdown of the uranium oxide. During shutdown, this is provided by diesel-fueled backup generators, which produce electricity to power the pumps that circulate the cooling water.

Ultimately, thirteen thousand people would die as a result of the 2011 earthquake; but when the shaking stopped, and the reactors shut down, 90 percent of them were still alive. Then, fifty minutes later, a forty-three-foot tsunami wave, traveling at an average speed of 310 miles per hour, hit the power station. The water destroyed the plant's seawall defenses and flooded the buildings containing the diesel generators that were cooling the nuclear fuel rods. The generators failed, and a second backup system kicked in, powered by a set of electrical batteries. The batteries had the capacity to run the plant's cooling systems for twenty-four hours. Under normal circumstances, this would have been enough time either to restore the diesel generators or to obtain more batteries. However, the tsunami, the biggest to hit Japan in modern times, destroyed anything and everything in its path. The sheer force of the water pulverized whole towns, forty-five thousand buildings, and almost a quarter of a million vehicles, and left the regions' roads and bridges in a mess. The areas where the tsunami hit came to a standstill, making it incredibly difficult to get medical help to the survivors and impossible to rush the backup batteries to the Fukushima plant in time to replace the ones running the cooling systems. Twenty-four hours after the tsunami hit, the batteries died and the temperature inside the reactors started to rise.

When nuclear fuel rods melt, they look a lot like lava, but the liquid is much hotter. Lava comes out of a volcano red-hot, typically at 1,800ºF. Liquid uranium-oxide nuclear fuel is much more fearsome, a white-hot liquid with a temperature exceeding 5,000ºF. It will melt and dissolve pretty much anything it comes in contact with. At Fukushima, it melted its way through the ten inches of steel that had been containing it, and then continued to eat through the concrete floor of at least one of the reactors. But that was just the beginning.

The nuclear fuel in the reactor is encased in an alloy made from zirconium. It is incredibly resistant to corrosion, except at high temperatures. At 5,000ºF, the zirconium alloys react strongly with water, producing hydrogen gas. It's estimated that as a result of the meltdown, one ton of hydrogen gas was produced in each of the plant's reactors. On March 12, the hydrogen gas reacted with the air inside the reactor containment building, creating an explosion that destroyed the complex.

Liquids are incredibly hard to contain, and as a result a great deal of the radioactive contamination from these nuclear meltdowns made its way into the area's water systems, and ultimately the sea. From there it can and does go anywhere and everywhere. This is why the primary concern of all nuclear-waste engineers is preventing water ingress into any of their storage facilities. Yet most nuclear power stations are built near large bodies of water, not because it's safer, but because it's cheaper. They need the water for cooling: having a large supply readily available makes the plant much more energy- and cost-efficient. But as we saw in Fu kushima, when disaster strikes, our water supply is vulnerable to a huge amount of radioactive waste.

This isn't just a nuclear issue. Almost all of the world's major cities are coastal because, historically, trade between countries required ports. But with sea levels rising as a result of global climate change, the impact of tsunamis and hurricanes and storms is going to make these places — and their dense populations — ever more vulnerable. The only way to protect ourselves from this threat is to get to higher ground, or perhaps into the air. A tempting thought, from my perch on the plane, where I was currently sipping water and looking down omnipotently at the vast Atlantic. It was a calm, clear day, and the ocean, I felt, looked almost innocent.

But then there was a bump, and the whole aircraft seemed to drop for a second before recovering. Then it happened again, so violently that water shot out of the top of my bottle and soaked my lap.

「We are currently flying through a patch of turbulence,」the captain announced over the intercom.「I'm turning on the FASTEN SEAT BELT sign, and ask that all passengers please return to their seats. We will resume the in-flight service in a few minutes when we reach smoother air.」The plane dropped vertiginously again. My stomach felt queasy, and out the window I caught a glimpse of the wings oscillating wildly.
