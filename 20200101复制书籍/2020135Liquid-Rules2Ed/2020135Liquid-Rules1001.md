# 1001. Indelible

I FOLDED THE TRAY table down and placed the customs form on top of it. I needed a pen. Did I have one? I couldn't remember. I checked my jacket pockets. Nothing. My carry-on bag was under my feet, but I couldn't bend down far enough to search through it because of the tray table. I tried anyway, pressing my face into the tray table as I reached for my bag below. It was awkward. I knew I should have just folded the table up, but for some unaccountable reason I didn't. I'd managed to get both hands into my carry-on, and they were feeling about, exploring the unseen world of my bag. By touch I identified my phone, the adaptor for my laptop, and some socks. Because my face was turned toward Susan, I ended up grimacing at her. Her eyes flicked across at me and seemed to register exasperation, as if I were a small child looking for attention. Then I hit gold. At the bottom of my bag I came across something that felt cylindrical, like a pen. Like a pearl diver heading for the surface, I lifted my head and extracted the object from the deep recesses of my bag. It was indeed a pen, albeit a pen I had no recollection of putting in my bag, or really of owning or buying in the first place. It had stayed there, unobserved among the detritus of my life, the small change and the chocolate wrappers that accumulate over time without my ever thinking I would need it. It was a ballpoint pen.

A ballpoint is the essence of pen-ness: it doesn't have the social status of the fountain pen, nor the sophistication of the fiber pen, but it works on most paper and does the job you need it to do. It rarely leaks and ruins your clothes, and it can lie unattended at the bottom of your bag for months and still work the first time you try to use it. It does all that, and still costs so little that it's routinely given away without thought. Indeed, most people regard ballpoint pens as common property: if you give someone such a pen to sign a form and they forget to give it back to you, you wouldn't brand the person a thief; you probably wouldn't even remember where you got the pen in the first place — it's quite likely you took it from someone else. But if you think what makes ballpoint pens so successful is their simplicity, you're wrong. That couldn't be further from the truth.

Obviously, what you need in a pen is ink. Ink is a liquid designed to do two things; first, to flow onto the page, and then to turn into a solid. Flowing is not difficult; it's what liquids do. And turning into a solid is something they generally do too. But doing both in the right order, reliably, and in a pretty fast time frame, so the ink doesn't smudge and become unreadable, is much trickier than it looks.

Historians believe that the ancient Egyptians were the first people to use a pen, around 3000 BCE. They used reed pens, usually made of bamboo or another reedy plant with stiff, hollow shoots. By drying the shoot and shaping its end with a cutting tool, creating a fine tip, they made a good vehicle for ink. The shoots had to be just the right size for the pen to work, though; if the diameter of the tube was narrow enough, the surface tension between the ink and the reed surface would slow the force of gravity and hold a small quantity of ink in place. Once the reed came in contact with the papyrus, which the Egyptians used as paper, the ink would be sucked onto the papyrus fibers through capillary action — the same force responsible for wicking, in candles and oil lamps. As the dry fibers absorbed the water in the ink, the pigments would stick to the surface, and once the water evaporated completely, the ink marks would hold on to the papyrus permanently.

The Egyptians made black ink by combining soot from oil lamps with the gum from the acacia tree, which acted as a binder. Like the resin that glued together their plywood, the Egyptians used acacia tree gum as a glue to bond the black carbon of the soot to the papyrus fibers. And because carbon is hydrophobic, meaning it doesn't mix with water, the acacia gum also allowed the carbon to be incorporated into water, creating a smooth, black, free-flowing ink. Gum arabic, as it's called, is still used today; you can buy it in most art shops. The proteins in the gum allow it to bind to many different pigments, and hence, it can be used to make all kinds of coloring agents — watercolors, dyes, and inks, to name a few. But the Egyptians used carbon, and that, as it turns out, was a good choice. Carbon-based ink is easy to make and very unreactive, which is why we have Egyptian documents going back thousands of years, preserved for us by the chemical permanence of carbon black ink.

Job done, you might think. But carbon ink is not perfect. It wouldn't be good for filling in customs forms, for instance, be cause, being water-based, it doesn't dry fast and hence is easy to smudge. And when it does dry, the sooty pigment isn't held strongly to the writing surface by the gum — so you can mechanically rub it away. Maybe you don't care, but others did, and so began hundreds of years of experimentation in the hope of making something better.

Eventually, they found gall ink: the ink Christians used to write the Bible, the ink Muslims used to write the Koran, the ink Shakespeare used to write his plays, the ink lawmakers used to write their Acts of Parliament. Gall ink is so good that it was commonly used right up to the twentieth century.

You make gall ink by putting an iron nail in a bottle with some vinegar; the vinegar corrodes the iron and leaves behind a red-brown solution, full of charged iron atoms. This is where the galls come in. Galls, also known as oak apples, are growths that sometimes turn up on oak trees. They're created when wasps lay their eggs in an oak bud. As the bud develops, the wasps manipulate the molecular machinery of the oak bud to create food for their larvae. This is bad for the tree, but good for literature, because it produces oak galls, with their high concentration of tannins, which led to a revolutionary innovation in ink.

Tannins are widely found in the plant world; they're part of a plant's chemical defense system, and yet somehow we've developed a taste for them — you may recall that the tannins in tea and red wine give them their astringency. Tannins are colored molecules that are good at chemically bonding to proteins — and thus they are able to impart color through bonding to things made of proteins. They have traditionally been used to stain leather, which has a high percentage of the protein collagen — hence the origin of the term「to tan leather.」They're also a big part of why red wine and tea can leave such bad stains on your clothes and teeth. So, the use of tannins in ink is perhaps not so surprising, ink being, essentially, an intentional stain. But it's hard to create a liquid with a high concentration of tannins — that's where the iron-vinegar solution comes in. It reacts with the tannic acid from the galls and produces a substance called iron tannate, which is highly water-soluble and very fluid. When iron tannate comes in contact with paper fibers, it flows, through capillary action, into all the small crevices in the paper, distributing itself evenly. And as the water evaporates, the tannates are deposited inside the paper, leaving a lasting blue-black mark. Its permanence is its great advantage over carbon inks: because the pigment isn't stuck to the surface of the paper, but rather within it, it can't be removed by rubbing or washing.

Of course, the very indelibility of gall ink was also one of its drawbacks for those who wrote with it. The ballpoint pen I was currently using to fill out the customs form didn't require me to dip the pen nib into a reservoir of ink, so there wasn't any ink coating the outside of it. My fingertips were still as clean as they were when I'd washed them with the liquid soap earlier. For most of the history of writing, this was emphatically not the case. Ink would get everywhere, especially on writers' hands, and gall ink, being very permanent, did not come off easily — certainly not by washing with soap. People complained, and ironically, some of these complaints came to be written down in gall ink. By the tenth century, the caliph of the Maghreb (now the region of northwest Africa encompassing Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia) had had enough; he demanded a solution from his engineers. In due course, in the year 974, he was presented with the first fountain pen recorded in history. This pen held its reservoir of ink within it, and apparently did not leak, even when held upside-down — I have to say, though, that this seems unlikely, not because the engineers of the time weren't ingenious, but because the fountain pen got reinvented many times over the next thousand years, and it was only after many, many iterations that a reliable fountain-pen mechanism was created, in the late nineteenth century. Leonardo da Vinci had a go in the sixteenth century, and there's some evidence that he was able to make a pen that wrote with continuous contrast, whereas ink laid down by quill pens, which were in com mon use at the time, tended to fade in and out. And there were certainly fountain pens around in the seventeenth century when Samuel Pepys mentioned them in his diary, content as he was at being able to carry around a pen without also needing to tote an inkpot. But those fountain pens weren't perfect; he still preferred using a feather quill pen and, yes, gall ink.

The nineteenth century saw a big surge in fountain-pen patents. But though all these pens had free-flowing ink, no one had yet devised a means of controlling the flow so that the ink didn't all rush out at once, making an enormous blob on the page. They couldn't just make the opening to the reservoir of ink very small: a tiny hole blocked the ink from coming out at all, and with a medium-sized hole it glugged its way sporadically onto the page. The reason for this behavior, which fountain-pen inventors were slowly beginning to understand, was the influence of air and the formation of vacuums inside the ink reservoirs.

When you try to pour liquid out of a container, you have to replace it with something; otherwise a vacuum will form inside the vessel, preventing more liquid from flowing out. You'll notice this if you try to drink from a bottle while covering the whole aperture with your mouth; the liquid comes out in glugs as the air fights to get in and replace the liquid you're drinking. Each glug corresponds to air forcing its way into the bottle, and as it does so, it keeps the liquid from coming out. They take it in turns — liquid out, air in, liquid out, air in, glug, glug, glug. If you leave the mouth of a bottle partially open as you drink, then you'll be able to drink continuously, without any glugs, because the air can flow in more smoothly. That's why it's easier to drink from wide-mouthed vessels, like cups and glasses.

But early fountain pens didn't have any mechanism for getting air into the reservoir of ink, so it was hard to get a consistent flow of ink onto the page. Putting a hole in the top of the reservoir seems like the obvious solution, but if you turn the pen upside-down, it will leak everywhere. The problem left everyone pretty flummoxed until 1884, when an American inventor, Lewis Waterman, perfected the design for a metal nib that allowed ink to flow down a groove by a combination of gravity and capillary action, while incoming air passed through in the opposite direction toward the reservoir. His design ushered in the golden era of the fountain pen, the cellphone of its age, transforming the way people communicated and making pens a highly coveted possession. Having a fountain pen signified you were important — you were someone who needed to be able to write anywhere, anytime. Just like the early cellphones, or the first laptops, or any number of more recent gadgets: it was cool.

But inevitably, another problem arose. Gall inks are often highly acidic, so they corroded the new metal pen nibs. They also often contained small particulate matter, which was visible in the ink when you wrote on the page, or clogged up the nib so the ink couldn't come out. People would shake their pens in rage, trying to dislodge whatever unseen obstacles were mucking up their writing, but in the process, they would lob ink across cafés or onto the clothes of unsuspecting passers-by. The fountain pen may have been perfected — the ink was not. It was time to replace gall ink.

But that was a complex problem. The particular chemistry of an ink and its ability to flow within the pen but not corrode it, its reaction with the paper, its ability to create a permanent mark but also dry quickly — all had to be considered at once. To use engineering jargon, it's a multiple optimization problem. Ultimately, there were many solutions, and each pen manufacturer incorporated a different one into its design, which is why, if you buy a fountain pen, the manufacturer will insist you use its specially formulated inks. The Parker Pen Company, for instance, developed Quink ink in 1928 to combat the problem of blotting. Parker's chemists combined synthetic dyes with alcohol to create an ink that flowed well in the pen, but then dried very quickly when it came into contact with paper. Unfortunately, it also chemically attacked some of the plastics, such as celluloid, that they'd started using to make pens. It also wasn't water-resistant, so if the paper got wet, the ink would start flowing again, often separating out the individual dyes used to make up the ink — black ink would separate into yellow and blue, for instance — ultimately making the writing unintelligible.

But despite all the problems, most pen manufacturers were convinced that fountain pens were the future, and that optimizing the ink was the answer to a reliable portable writing instrument. But the Hungarian inventor László Bíró had a completely different idea. He turned the optimization problem on its head. Before becoming an inventor, he'd worked as a journalist and had noticed that the inks used by newspaper printers were excellent — they were extremely fast-drying, and rarely smudged or formed blots. But they were too viscous for a fountain pen; they wouldn't flow, and gummed up the pen. So, he figured, instead of changing the ink, why not redesign the pen?

Bíró's newspaper articles were printed on a press made from a set of rolls that press ink onto a continuous sheet of paper. In order to have the millions of newspapers needed to meet the demand across the country ready for overnight delivery, they had to be printed very quickly. The pages went through the press at a rate of thousands per hour, so it was imperative that the inks dry immediately; otherwise they would smudge as the pages were assembled into a newspaper. To meet that need, the printing ink that Bíró admired so much was invented. As he considered how to make a better pen, he thought about ways of re-creating the printing process on this much smaller scale. He'd need some sort of roller that could continuously ink the pen tip; eventually, he hit upon the idea of using a tiny ball. But how to get the ink onto the ball so it could then be used to roll the ink onto the page? He'd assumed that the printer inks would be too thick for gravity to pull them down from the pen's reservoir to the ball. But a strange piece of physics came to his rescue — non-Newtonian flow.

There's a relationship between the speed of a liquid's flow and the sheer force that's exerted on it — what we call viscosity. So, thick liquids like honey have a high viscosity and flow slowly, while runny liquids like water have a low viscosity and flow quickly under the same force. For most liquids, if you increase the force you're applying to them, the viscosity will remain the same. This is called Newtonian flow.

But some liquids are strange; they don't play by the rules of Newtonian flow. For example, if you mix cornmeal with a bit of cold water, it forms a liquid that's runny when you stir it gently, but if you try to stir it quickly, the liquid becomes very viscous, to the point that it behaves like a solid. You can punch its surface, and it won't splash at all, but rather resist your fist, as a solid does. This is what we call non-Newtonian behavior — the liquid doesn't have one viscosity that determines its flow.

That cornmeal liquid is sometimes referred to as oobleck (the name comes from Dr. Seuss's book Bartholomew and the Oobleck ). Oobleck's non-Newtonian behavior is entirely due to its internal structure. On a microscopic level, oobleck is full of tiny starch particles, like cornmeal suspended very densely in water. At low speeds, the starch particles have enough time to find routes to flow around one another — a bit like passengers leaving a packed train. This is when they flow normally. But when put under pressure to flow quickly, as they are when you're trying to stir the oobleck quickly or punching its surface, the starch particles don't have enough time to move around one another, and so they're stopped in place. And just as passengers at the back of a train cannot move if those at the front are stationary, so too does the thwarting of a few starch particles hold up the rest, which is why the whole liquid locks up, becoming more and more viscous.

Oobleck is not the only non-Newtonian liquid. If you've ever painted a wall with emulsion paint, you might have noticed that the paint is extremely thick when it's in the can, almost like a jelly. But if you follow the instructions on the side of the can and thoroughly mix the paint, you'll find that as you stir, the paint becomes fluid, and then turns back to jelly as soon as you stop. This is also non-Newtonian behavior, but here the liquid is becoming runnier as a result of the force exerted on it, rather than more viscous. Again, the reason originates from the inner structure of the liquid. Emulsion paint is just water with lots of tiny droplets of oil held in suspension inside it. When the droplets are allowed to settle, they're attracted to one another and form tiny bonds, trapping the water between them to form a weak structure — a jelly. When you stir the paint, the molecular bonds holding the tiny droplets of oil to one another are broken, releasing the water and allowing the paint to flow. The same thing happens when you put the paint under stress by spreading it onto a wall with a paintbrush. But once the paint is on the wall and it's no longer under stress, the bonds between the droplets of oil re-form and the paint becomes viscous again, creating a thick coat that doesn't drip. That's the theory, anyway; obviously it all comes down to how well the chemists who formulate the paint control the bonds between the droplets of oil, their size, and their number. It takes a lot of work to get the balance just right, which is why it's worth the premium you pay to get a good can of paint.

Even if you are not a painter and decorator, you will have come across non-Newtonian liquids in the kitchen. Like emulsion paint, tomato ketchup thins when it's under stress. It won't budge until you hit the bottle, putting the ketchup under enough sheer pressure for it to suddenly thin and shoot out of the bottle. That's why it's so hard to control the rate at which ketchup comes out of the bottle — if the force isn't high enough, it flows extremely slowly, but once you give it a big whack, the viscosity suddenly drops and it splatters all over your plate.

One of the most dangerous kinds of non-Newtonian behavior occurs when you mix together sand and water, creating a substance that's often called quicksand. Quicksand has semi-solid properties until put under pressure, and then it thins out, turning it into a fluid liquid — so-called liquefaction. That's why when you step into quicksand, the more you struggle and wriggle to get out, the more the liquid thins and the deeper you sink. But no matter what you see in the movies, most likely you won't die by sinking into quicksand; because it's a liquid with a higher density than your body, once you're submerged to your waist, you'll float back up. Still, getting out is very hard, since if you don't move, the liquid thickens and solidifies around you, and if you do struggle, it thins, making it hard to get a solid foothold. In other words, you're stuck until you're rescued — and that's when it can get deadly.

But more dangerous than quicksand is the liquefaction that occurs during earthquakes. Here, in another deadly example of non-Newtonian flow, the stress from the earthquake's vibrations liquefies the soil, usually causing massive damage. Just look at the 2011 earthquake in New Zealand: it struck the city of Christchurch, causing significant liquefaction that destroyed buildings and spewed thousands of tons of sand and silt onto the city.

As it turned out, non-Newtonian thinning was exactly the property that László Bíró needed to make the thick newspaper inks work in a fountain pen. He hypothesized that it would allow the ink to flow easily while you were writing, but then, once the ink was on the page, it would become thick and viscous again and dry into a solid so rapidly that it wouldn't smudge. Bíró started trying to make the perfect pen with his brother, who was a chemist; after many struggles, including having to immigrate to Argentina at the outbreak of World War II, they finally had something that worked. Their pens have a reservoir of ink that feeds a tiny rotating ball; when you write with the pen, the ball rotates, putting the ink under enough pressure to change its viscosity, so it comes flowing out onto the ball. At that point, the ink goes back to being sticky and gooey, until it hits the paper and flows out again. When you lift the pen, relieving the ink of its stress, it becomes thick again, and the solvents in the ink, which are being exposed to air for the first time, quickly evaporate, leaving the ink's dyes on the paper and creating a permanent mark. Genius!

As you might expect, over the years the ingredients used in making such a high-performing ink have become trade secrets, but if you want to get a sense of just how good they are, write with a ballpoint pen on a piece of paper and then try to smudge the words with your finger. It's really hard to do. But that's not the only advantage that the non-Newtonian ink in ballpoint pens has over the more fluid inks in fountain pens. Because it doesn't flow under capillary action, the ink doesn't bleed as it seeps into the paper, as ink from other pens does. It's been chemically formulated to have a low surface tension when it comes into contact with cellulose fibers, as well as with the ceramic powders and plasticizers (known as sizing) that are added to the top surface of paper to make it glossy. Fountain-pen inks and other fluid inks have a high surface tension with sizing, so the ink sits on top of it and breaks up into small droplets. If you've ever tried to make notes on the front of a glossy magazine with a fountain pen, or tried to sign the back of a credit card with one, you'll have noticed this — the ink doesn't stay put. But ink from ballpoint pens seems to dry anywhere and stay exactly where you want it — even if you write upside-down — because it's not flowing, thanks to the force of gravity, but instead being rolled onto the page.

If you do try to write upside-down, you'll discover still another advantage of the ballpoint pen. Just like the fountain pen, it won't work if a vacuum forms in the reservoir of ink. But it has a simple way of preventing that — the top of the reservoir is open to the air, and the ink is quite viscous and won't flow without experiencing a lot of stress, so it doesn't fall out. Neat, eh? All that means is that, happily for the forgetful among us, you can leave a ballpoint pen at the bottom of your bag for months on end and it won't leak and cover your stuff with ink. Even if you forget to put the top back on and the ballpoint's left sitting unprotected in your pocket, the ink won't come out.

So good is this concept, and so reliable is the ballpoint pen at writing, even when the top has been off for months, that early manufacturers realized they didn't really need to put a top on the pen at all. Why not just retract the reservoir and ball back into the main body of the pen when you're not using it? That's easy enough to do, and so the retractable ballpoint pen was born. Click it, and you can write; click again, and the ballpoint is retracted. Oh, how the caliph of the Maghreb would have rejoiced at the sheer non-messiness and the audible delight of the retractable ballpoint pen!

The Bíró brothers produced the first commercial ballpoint pen while living in Argentina. They sold tons of them, to any number of clients, including the Royal Air Force, whose navigators snapped them up to replace the fountain pens they had been using, which always leaked at high altitude. Remembering this, I looked with renewed respect at the ballpoint I was holding in my hand — pilots and their crews were among the first to appreciate its brilliance, and I was happy to be filling in a customs form at altitude, using a descendant of those early ballpoint pens. According to the biggest manufacturer of ballpoint pens on the market today, the French company Bic, more than 100 billion pens have been made since they were first invented.

László Bíró died in 1985, but his legacy lives on. In Argentina they celebrate Inventors' Day every year on the anniversary of his birthday, September 29, and to this day, in the UK we call a ballpoint pen a biro.

Of course, despite its success, many people hate the ballpoint pen. They decry its invention, saying it defiled the art of handwriting. It's true that the price for creating a portable, anti-smudge, anti-leaking, long-lasting, inexpensive, socially inclusive pen has been that the thickness of the line it creates cannot vary. Line thickness is determined by the size of the ball bearing at the tip, and because a ballpoint's ink doesn't flow once it's deposited on paper, the thickness of its line won't change by slowing down or speeding up your writing, as it would with the fountain pen, or other pens using Newtonian ink. Writing from ballpoint pens is more utilitarian, less expressive of an individual's writing style. But personally, I think it ranks up there with the bicycle for its impact on society. It's a piece of liquid engineering that's solved an age-old problem, has produced something utterly reliable, and is available at a price that is so affordable, most people regard ballpoint pens as communal property.

By the time I'd finished the customs form, I was so in awe of my ballpoint that I couldn't just put it back in my bag and consign it to another few months of being ignored. As I was trying to decide what to do with it, I realized that Susan was looking at me — a different Susan from the one I'd spent the flight with; a smiling Susan. She had her customs form in front of her, and she motioned to me, putting her thumb and forefinger together — miming the act of writing — and asking if she could borrow my ballpoint.
