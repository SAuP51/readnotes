## Preface

### 01. Why I Wrote This Book

Students who perform poorly on organic chemistry exams often report having invested countless hours studying. Why do many students have difficulty preparing themselves for organic chemistry exams? Certainly, there are several contributing factors, including inefficient study habits, but perhaps the most dominant factor is a fundamental disconnect between what students learn in the lecture hall and the tasks expected of them during an exam. To illustrate the disconnect, consider the following analogy.

Imagine that a prestigious university offers a course entitled “Bike-Riding 101.” Throughout the course, physics and engineering professors explain many concepts and principles (for example, how bicycles have been engineered to minimize air resistance). Students invest significant time studying the information that was presented, and on the last day of the course, the final exam consists of riding a bike for a distance of 100 feet. A few students may have innate talents and can accomplish the task without falling. But most students will fall several times, slowly making it to the finish line, bruised and hurt; and many students will not be able to ride for even one second without falling. Why? Because there is a disconnect between what the students learned and what they were expected to do for their exam.

Many years ago, I noticed that a similar disconnect exists in traditional organic chemistry instruction. That is, learning organic chemistry is much like bicycle riding; just as the students in the bike-riding analogy were expected to ride a bike after attending lectures, it is often expected that organic chemistry students will independently develop the necessary skills for solving problems. While a few students have innate talents and are able to develop the necessary skills independently, most students require guidance. This guidance was not consistently integrated within existing textbooks, prompting me to write the first edition of my textbook, Organic Chemistry. The main goal of my text was to employ a skills-based approach to bridge the gap between theory (concepts) and practice (problem-solving skills). The second edition further supported this goal by introducing hundreds of additional problems based on the chemical literature, thereby exposing students to exciting real-world examples of chemical research being conducted in real laboratories. The phenomenal success of the first two editions has been extremely gratifying because it provided strong evidence that my skills-based approach is indeed effective at bridging the gap described above.

I firmly believe that the scientific discipline of organic chemistry is NOT merely a compilation of principles, but rather, it is a disciplined method of thought and analysis. Students must certainly understand the concepts and principles, but more importantly, students must learn to think like organic chemists . . . that is, they must learn to become proficient at approaching new situations methodically, based on a repertoire of skills. That is the true essence of organic chemistry.

### 02. A Skills-Based Approach

To address the disconnect in organic chemistry instruction, I have developed a skills-based approach to instruction. The textbook includes all of the concepts typically covered in an organic chemistry textbook, complete with conceptual checkpoints that promote mastery of the concepts, but special emphasis is placed on skills development through SkillBuilders to support these concepts. Each SkillBuilder contains three parts:

Learn the Skill: contains a solved problem that demonstrates a particular skill.

Practice the Skill: includes numerous problems (similar to the solved problem in Learn the Skill) that give students valuable opportunities to practice and master the skill.

Apply the Skill: contains one or two more problems in which the student must apply the skill to solve real-world problems (as reported in the chemical literature). These problems include conceptual, cumulative, and applied problems that encourage students to think outside of the box. Sometimes problems that foreshadow concepts introduced in later chapters are also included.

At the end of each SkillBuilder, a Need More Practice? reference suggests end-of-chapter problems that students can work to practice the skill.

This emphasis upon skills development provides students with a greater opportunity to develop proficiency in the key skills necessary to succeed in organic chemistry. Certainly, not all necessary skills can be covered in a textbook. However, there are certain skills that are fundamental to all other skills.

As an example, resonance structures are used repeatedly throughout the course, and students must become masters of resonance structures early in the course. Therefore, a significant portion of Chapter 2 is devoted to pattern-recognition for drawing resonance structures. Rather than just providing a list of rules and then a few follow-up problems, the skills-based approach provides students with a series of skills, each of which must be mastered in sequence. Each skill is reinforced with numerous practice problems. The sequence of skills is designed to foster and develop proficiency in drawing resonance structures.

The skills-based approach to organic chemistry instruction is a unique approach. Certainly, other textbooks contain tips for problem solving, but no other textbook consistently presents skills development as the primary vehicle for instruction.

### 03. What's New In This Edition

Peer review played a very strong role in the development of the first and second editions of Organic Chemistry. Specifically, the first edition manuscript was reviewed by nearly 500 professors and over 5,000 students, and the second edition manuscript was based on comments received from 300 professors and 900 students. In preparing the third edition, peer review has played an equally prominent role. We have received a tremendous amount of input from the market, including surveys, class tests, diary reviews, and phone interviews. All of this input has been carefully culled and has been instrumental in identifying the focus of the third edition.

New Features in the Third Edition

• A new chapter on organometallic reactions covers modern synthetic techniques, including Stille coupling, Suzuki coupling, Negishi coupling, the Heck reaction, and alkene metathesis.

• Substitution and elimination reactions have been combined into one chapter. This chapter (Chapter 7) also features a new section covering the preparation and reactions of alkyl tosylates, as well as a new section covering kinetic isotope effects. In addition, a new section introducing retrosynthesis has been added to the end of the chapter, so that synthesis and retrosynthesis are now introduced much earlier.

• For most SkillBuilders throughout the text, the Apply the Skill problem(s) have been replaced with moderate-level, literature-based problems. There are at least 150 of these new problems, which will expose students to exciting real-world examples of chemical research being conducted in real laboratories. Students will see that organic chemistry is a vibrant field of study, with endless possibilities for exploration and research that can benefit the world in concrete ways.

• Throughout the text, the distribution of problems has been improved by reducing the number of easy problems, and increasing the number of moderate-level, literature-based problems.

• Each chapter now includes a problem set that mimics the style of the ACS Organic Chemistry Exam.

• The section covering oxidation of alcohols (in Chapter 12, and then again in Chapter 19) has been enhanced to include modern oxidation methods, such as Swern and DMP-based oxidations.

• Coverage of Wittig reactions has been updated to include stereochemical outcomes and the Horner–WadsworthEmmons variation.

• Section 2.11 has been revised (Assessing the relative importance of resonance structures). The rules have been completely rewritten to focus on the importance of octets and locations of charges. The improved rules will provide students with a deeper conceptual understanding.

• In Chapter 2, a new section covers the skills necessary for drawing a resonance hybrid.

• At the end of Chapter 5 (Stereoisomerism), a new section introduces chiral compounds that lack chiral centers, including chiral allenes and chiral biphenyls.

• A new section in Chapter 11 (Synthesis) introduces “green chemistry” (atom economy, toxicology issues, etc.).

• Coverage of E-Z nomenclature has been moved earlier. It now appears in Chapter 5, which covers stereoisomerism.

### 04. Text Organization

The sequence of chapters and topics in Organic Chemistry, 3e does not differ markedly from that of other organic chemistry textbooks. Indeed, the topics are presented in the traditional order, based on functional groups (alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acid derivatives, etc.). Despite this traditional order, a strong emphasis is placed on mechanisms, with a focus on pattern recognition to illustrate the similarities between reactions that would otherwise appear unrelated. No shortcuts were taken in any of the mechanisms, and all steps are clearly illustrated, including all proton transfer steps.

Two chapters (6 and 11) are devoted almost entirely to skill development and are generally not found in other textbooks. Chapter 6, Chemical Reactivity and Mechanisms, emphasizes skills that are necessary for drawing mechanisms, while Chapter 11, Synthesis, prepares the students for proposing syntheses. These two chapters are strategically positioned within the traditional order described above and can be assigned to the students for independent study. That is, these two chapters do not need to be covered during precious lecture hours, but can be, if so desired.

The traditional order allows instructors to adopt the skillsbased approach without having to change their lecture notes or methods. For this reason, the spectroscopy chapters (Chapters 14 and 15) were written to be stand-alone and portable, so that instructors can cover these chapters in any order desired. In fact, five of the chapters (Chapters 2, 3, 7, 12, and 13) that precede the spectroscopy chapters include end-of-chapter spectroscopy problems, for those students who covered spectroscopy earlier. Spectroscopy coverage also appears in subsequent functional group chapters, specifically Chapter 17 (Aromatic Compounds), Chapter 19 (Aldehydes and Ketones), Chapter 20 (Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives), Chapter 22 (Amines), Chapter 24 (Carbohydrates), and Chapter 25 (Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins).
