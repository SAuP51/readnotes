This chapter focuses on the wide variety of species that are classified as acids and bases. The first part describes the Brønsted definition, in which an acid is a proton donor and a base is a proton acceptor. Proton transfer equilibria can be discussed quantitatively in terms of acidity constants, which are a measure of the tendency for species to donate protons. In the second part of the chapter we introduce the Lewis definition of acids and bases which deals with reactions involving electron-pair sharing between a donor (the base) and an acceptor (the acid). This broadening enables us to extend our discussion of acids and bases to include species that do not contain protons and to reactions in nonprotic media. We also introduce a molecular orbital description of hydrogen bonding, which has a very special place in chemistry and biology. Because of the greater diversity of Lewis species, a single scale of strength is not appropriate, and two approaches are taken: in one, acids and bases are classified as 'hard' or 'soft'; in the other, thermochemical data are used to obtain a set of parameters characteristic of each species. The final sections introduce nonaqueous solvents and describe some of the most important applications of acid–base chemistry.

The original distinction between acids and bases was based, hazardously, on criteria of taste and feel: acids were sour and bases felt soapy. A deeper chemical understanding of their properties emerged from Arrhenius's (1884) conception of an acid as a compound that produces (positively charged) hydrogen ions in water. The modern definitions that we consider in this chapter are based on a broader range of chemical reactions. The definition due to Brønsted and Lowry focuses on proton transfer, and that due to Lewis is based on dative bond formation — the interaction of electron pair acceptor and electron pair donor molecules and ions.

Acid–base reactions are common, although we do not always immediately recognize them as such, especially if they involve more subtle definitions of what it is to be an acid or base. For instance, production of acid rain begins with a very simple reaction between sulfur dioxide (the acid) and water (the base):

2SO2 (g) + H2O(l) → HOSO2−(aq) + H+(aq)

Saponification, the process used in soapmaking, is another acid–base reaction:

NaOH(aq) + RCOOR'(aq) → RCO2Na(aq) + R'OH(aq)

Many simple inorganic compounds which are discrete molecules in the gas phase condense as polymers because they contain both Lewis acid (Be) and Lewis base (Cl) centres that can form intermolecular dative bonds.

nBeCl2 (g) → (BeCl2 )n(s)

There are many such reactions, and in due course we shall see why they are regarded as reactions between acids and bases.

## Brønsted acidity

KEY POINTS 

A Brønsted acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted base is a proton acceptor. A proton has no separate existence in chemistry and it is always associated with other species. A simple representation of a hydrogen ion in water is as the hydronium ion, H3O+.







Johannes Brønsted in Denmark and Thomas Lowry in England proposed (in 1923) that the essential feature of an acid–base reaction is the transfer of a hydrogen ion, H+ , from one species to another. In the context of this definition, a hydrogen ion is often referred to as a proton. They suggested that any substance that acts as a proton donor should be classified as an acid, and any substance that acts as a proton acceptor should be classified as a base. Substances that act in this way are now called 'Brønsted acids' and 'Brønsted bases', respectively:

A Brønsted acid is a proton donor.

A Brønsted base is a proton acceptor.

The definitions make no reference to the environment in which proton transfer occurs, so they apply to proton transfer behaviour in any solvent and even in no solvent at all.

An example of a Brønsted acid is hydrogen fluoride, HF, which can donate a proton to another molecule, such as H2 O, when it dissolves in water:

HF(g) + H2 O(l) → H3 O+ (aq) + F− (aq)

An example of a Brønsted base is ammonia, NH3 , which can accept a proton from a proton donor:

H2 O(l) + NH3 (aq) → NH4 + (aq) + OH− (aq)

As these two examples show, water is an example of an amphiprotic substance, a substance that can act as both a Brønsted acid and a Brønsted base.

When an acid donates a proton to a water molecule, the latter is converted into a hydronium ion, H3 O + (1; the dimensions are taken from the crystal structure of H3 O+ ClO4 – ). However, the entity H3 O + is almost certainly an oversimplified description of the proton in water, for it participates in extensive hydrogen bonding (Sections 5.8 and 10.6) and a better representation is H9 O 4 + (2). Gas-phase studies of water clusters using mass spectrometry suggest that a cage of H2 O molecules can condense around one H3 O + ion in a regular pentagonal dodecahedral arrangement, resulting in the formation of the species H+ (H2 O)21 . As these structures indicate, the most appropriate description of a proton in water varies according to the environment and the experiment under consideration; for simplicity, we shall use the representation H3 O + throughout.

5.1 Proton transfer equilibria in water

Proton transfer between acids and bases is fast in both directions, so the dynamic equilibria

HF(aq) + H2 O(l)  H3 O+ (aq) + F− (aq)

H2 O(l) + NH3 (aq)  NH4 + (aq) + OH− (aq)

give a more complete description of the behaviour of the acid HF and the base NH 3 in water than the forward reaction alone. The central feature of Brønsted acid–base chemistry in aqueous solution is that of rapid attainment of equilibrium in the proton-transfer reaction, and we concentrate on this aspect.

(a) Conjugate acids and bases

KEY POINTS When a species donates a proton, it becomes the conjugate base; when a species gains a proton, it becomes the conjugate acid. Conjugate acids and bases are in equilibrium in solution.

The form of the two forward and reverse reactions given above, both of which depend on the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base, is expressed by writing the general Brønsted equilibrium as



Acid 1 + Base2 

Acid 2 + Base1 

The species Base 1 is called the conjugate base of Acid1 , and Acid 2 is the conjugate acid of Base2 . The conjugate base of an acid is the species that is left after a proton is lost. The conjugate acid of a base is the species formed when a proton is gained. Thus, F − is the conjugate base of HF and H3 O + is the conjugate acid of H2 O. There is no fundamental distinction between an acid and a conjugate acid or a base and a conjugate base: a conjugate acid is just another acid and a conjugate base is just another base.

Identifying acids and bases

EXAMPLE 5.1

Identify the Brønsted acid and its conjugate base in the following reactions:

(a) HSO4 − (aq) + OH− (aq) → H2 O(l) + SO4 2 − (aq)

(b) PO4 3 − (aq) + H2 O(l) → HPO4 2– (aq) + OH− 

Answer We need to identify the species that loses a proton and its conjugate partner. (a) The hydrogensulfate ion, HSO4 − , transfers a proton to hydroxide; it is therefore the acid and the SO 4 2 − ion produced is its conjugate base. (b) The H2 O molecule transfers a proton to the phosphate ion acting as a base; thus H2 O is the acid and the OH − ion is its conjugate base.

Self-test 5.1 Identify the acid, base, conjugate acid, and conjugate base in the following reactions:

(a) HNO3 (aq) + H2 O(l) → H3 O+ (aq) + NO3 − (aq)

(b) CO3 2 − (aq) + H2 O(l) → HCO3 – (aq) + OH− 

(c) NH3 (aq) + H2 S(aq) → NH4 + (aq) + HS− (aq).

(b) The strengths of Brønsted acids

KEY POINTS The strength of a Brønsted acid is measured by its acidity constant, and the strength of a Brønsted base is measured by its basicity constant; the stronger the base, the weaker is its conjugate acid.

Throughout this discussion, we shall need the concept of pH, which we assume to be familiar from introductory chemistry:

pH = −log [H3 O+ ], and hence [H3 O+ ] = 10− pH 

(5.1)

The strength of a Brønsted acid, such as HF, in aqueous solution is expressed by its acidity constant (or 'acid ionization constant'), Ka :

[H3 O + ][F − ] HF(aq) + H2 O(l)  H3 O+ (aq) + F− (aq) K a = [HF]

More generally:

[H3 O + ][X − ] HX(aq) + H2 O(l)  H3 O+ (aq) + X− (aq) K a = [HX]

(5.2)

In this definition, [X− ] denotes the numerical value of the molar concentration of the species X − (so, if the molar concentration of HF molecules is 0.001 mol dm− 3 , then [HF] =

0.001). A value K a <<1 implies that [HX] is large with respect to [X– ], and so proton retention by the acid is favoured. The experimental value of K a for hydrogen fluoride in water is

3.5 × 10− 4 , indicating that under normal conditions, only a very small fraction of HF molecules are deprotonated. The actual fraction deprotonated can be calculated as a function of acid concentration from the numerical value of Ka .

A NOTE ON GOOD PRACTICE

In precise work, K a is expressed in terms of the activity of X, a(X), its effective thermodynamic concentration. The acidity constant is based on the assumption that the solutions are sufficiently dilute for it to be permissible to write a(H2 O) = 1.

EXAMPLE 5.2

Calculating acidity constants

The pH of 0.145 M CH3 COOH(aq) is 2.80. Calculate K a for ethanoic acid.

Answer To calculate K a we need to calculate the concentrations of H3 O+ , CH3 CO2 − , and CH3 COOH in the solution. The concentration of H3 O + is obtained from the pH by writing [H3 O+ ] = 10− pH , so in a solution of pH = 2.80, the molar concentration of H3 O + is 1.6 × 10 − 3 mol dm− 3 . Each deprotonation event produces one H3 O + ion and one CH3 CO 2 − ion, so the concentration of CH3 CO 2 − is the same as that of the H3 O + ions (provided the autoprotolysis of water can be neglected). The molar concentration of the

remaining acid is 0.145 − 0.0016 mol dm − 3 = 0.143 mol dm− 3 .

Therefore

( 1.6 × 10 − 3 )2  K a = = 1.7 × 10− 5  0.143

This value corresponds to pK a = 4.77 (units are usually omitted).

Self-test 5.2 For hydrofluoric acid K a = 3.5 × 10− 4 . Calculate the pH of 0.10 M HF(aq).

Likewise, the proton transfer equilibrium characteristic of a base, such as NH3 , in water can be expressed in terms of a basicity constant, Kb :

More generally:

If Kb <<1, then [HB+ ] << [B] at typical concentrations of B and only a small fraction of B molecules are protonated. Therefore, the base is a weak proton acceptor and its conjugate acid is present in low concentration. The experimental value of K b for ammonia in water is 1.8 × 10− 5 , indicating that under normal conditions, only a very small fraction of NH 3 molecules is protonated. As for the acid calculation, the actual fraction of base protonated can be determined from the value of Kb .

Because water is amphiprotic, a proton transfer equilibrium exists even in the absence of added acids or bases. The proton transfer from one water molecule to another is called autoprotolysis (or 'autoionization'). Proton transfer in water is very fast because it involves the interchange of weak hydrogen bonds between neighbouring molecules (Sections 5.8 and 10.6). The extent of autoprotolysis and the composition of the solution at equilibrium is described by the autoprotolysis constant (or 'autoionization constant') of water:

2 H2 O(l)  H3 O+ (aq) + OH− (aq) K w = [H3 O+ ][OH− ]

The experimental value of K w is 1.00 × 10 − 14 at 25°C, indicating that only a very tiny fraction of water molecules are present as ions in pure water. Indeed, we know that because the pH of pure water is 7.00, and [H3 O+ ] = [OH− ], then [H3 O+ ] = 1.0 × 10 − 7 mol dm− 3 . Tap and bottled water have a pH slightly below 7 due to dissolved CO2 .

An important role for the autoprotolysis constant of a solvent is that it enables us to relate the strength of a base to the strength of its conjugate acid, thereby allowing use of a single constant to express both acidity and basicity strength. Thus, the value of K b for the ammonia equilibrium in which NH 3 acts as a base is related to the value of K a for the equilibrium

NH4 + (aq) + H2 O(l)  H3 O+ (aq) + NH3 (aq)

in which its conjugate acid acts as an acid by

Ka Kb =Kw 

(5.4)

The implication of eqn 5.4 is that the larger the value of Kb , the smaller the value of Ka . That is, the stronger the base, the weaker is its conjugate acid. It is conventional to report the strength of a base in terms of the acidity constant K a of its conjugate acid.

A BRIEF ILLUSTRATION

The K b of ammonia in water is 1.8 × 10− 5 . It follows that K a of the conjugate acid NH 4 + is

Because, like molar concentrations, acidity constants span many orders of magnitude, it is convenient to report them as their common logarithms (logarithms to the base 10) like pH by using

pK = −log K

(5.5)

where K may be any of the constants we have introduced. At 25°C, for instance, pK w = 14.00. It follows from this definition and the relation in eqn 5.4 that

pK a + pK b = pKw 

(5.6)

A similar expression relates the strengths of conjugate acids and bases in any solvent, with pK w replaced by the appropriate autoprotolysis constant of the solvent, pKsol .

(c) Strong and weak acids and bases

KEY POINTS An acid or base is classified as either weak or strong de pending on the size of its acidity constant.

Table 5.1 lists the acidity constants of some common acids and conjugate acids of some bases in water. A substance is classified as a strong acid if the proton transfer equilibrium lies strongly in favour of donation of a proton to the solvent. Thus, a substance with pK a < 0 (corresponding to K a > 1 and usually to K a >> 1) is a strong acid. Such acids are commonly regarded as being fully deprotonated in solution (but it must never be forgotten that that is only an approximation). For example, hydrochloric acid is regarded as a solution of H3 O + and Cl − ions, and a negligible concentration of HCl molecules. A substance with pK a > 0 (corresponding to Ka  < 1) is classified as a weak acid; for such species, the proton transfer equilibrium lies in favour of nonionized acid. Hydrogen fluoride is a weak acid in water, and hydrofluoric acid consists of hydronium ions, fluoride ions, and a high proportion of HF molecules. Carbonic acid (H2 CO3 ), the hydrate of CO2 , is another weak acid.

A strong base is a species that is almost fully protonated in water. An example is the oxide ion, O2 − , which is immediately converted into OH − ions in water. A weak base is only partially protonated in water, an example being NH3 . The conjugate base of any strong acid is a weak base, because it is thermodynamically unfavourable for such a base to accept a proton.

The pH of a dilute solution containing a simple mixture of acid HX and its conjugate base X − is given by


(d) Polyprotic acids

KEY POINTS A polyprotic acid loses protons in succession, and successive deprotonations are progressively less favourable; a distribution diagram summarizes how the fraction of each species present depends on the pH of the solution.

A polyprotic acid is a substance that can donate more than one proton. An example is hydrogen sulfide, H2 S, a diprotic acid. For a diprotic acid, there are two successive proton donations and two acidity constants:

H2 S(aq) + H2 O(l)  HS− (aq) + H3 O+ (aq)

HS− (aq) + H2 O(l)  S2 − (aq) + H3 O+ (aq)

[H3 O + ][HS − ] Ka 1 = [H

2 S]

[H3 O + ][S 2− ] Ka 2 = [HS ]

From Table 5.1, K a1 = 9.1 × 10 − 8 (pK a1 = 7.04) and K a2 ≈ 1.1 × 10 − 19 (pK a2 = 19). The second acidity constant, Ka2 , is always smaller than K a1 (and hence pK a2 is larger than pKa1 ). The decrease in K a is consistent with an electrostatic model of the acid in which, in the second deprotonation, a proton must separate from a centre with one more negative charge than in the first deprotonation. Because additional electrostatic work must be done to remove the positively charged proton, the deprotonation is less favourable.

Calculating concentrations of ions in polyprotic acids Calculate the concentration of carbonate ions in 0.10 M

H2 CO3 (aq). K a1 is given in Table 5.1; K a2 = 4.6 × 10− 11 .

Answer We need to consider the equilibria for the successive deprotonation steps with their acidity constants:

We suppose that the second deprotonation is so slight that it has no effect on the value of [H3 O+ ] arising from the first deprotonation, in which case we can write [H3 O+ ] = [HCO3 − ]. These two terms therefore cancel in the expression for Ka2 , which results in

K a2 = [CO3 2 − ]

independent of the initial concentration of the acid. It follows that the concentration of carbonate ions in the solution is 4.6 × 10 − 11 mol dm− 3 .

Self-test 5.3 Calculate the pH of 0.20 M H2 C4 H4 O6 (aq) (tartaric acid), given K a1 = 1.0 × 10 − 3 and K a2 = 4.6 × 10− 5 .

The clearest representation of the concentrations of the species that are formed in the successive proton transfer equilibria of polyprotic acids is a distribution diagram, a diagram showing the fraction of solute present as a specified species X, f(X), plotted against the pH. Consider, for instance, the triprotic acid H3 PO4 , which releases three protons in succession to give H2 PO4 − , HPO4 2 − , and PO4 3 − . The fraction of solute present as intact H3 PO 4 molecules is

[H4 − 3 PO ] f (H3 PO 4 ) = 4 2− (5.8) [H3 PO 4 ] + [H2 PO ] + [HPO 4 ] + [PO 4 3 − ]

The concentration of each solute at a given pH can be calculated from the pK a values. 1 Figure 5.1 shows the fraction of

FIGURE 5.1 Distribution diagram for the various forms of the triprotic acid phosphoric acid in water, as a function of pH.

all four solute species as a function of pH and hence summarizes the relative importance of each acid and its conjugate base at each pH. Conversely, the diagram indicates the pH of the solution that contains a particular fraction of the species. We see, for instance, that if pH < pKa1 , corresponding to high hydronium ion concentrations, then the dominant species is the fully protonated H3 PO 4 molecule. However, if pH > pKa3 , corresponding to low hydronium ion concentrations, then the dominant species is the fully deprotonated PO 4 3 − ion. The intermediate species are dominant when pH values lie between the relevant pK a values.

(e) Factors governing the strengths of Brønsted acids and bases

KEY POINTS Proton affinity is the negative of the gas phase protongain enthalpy. The proton affinities of p-block conjugate bases decrease to the right along a period and down a group. Proton affinities (and accordingly, the strengths of bases) are influenced by solvation, which stabilizes species carrying a charge.

A quantitative understanding of the relative acidities of X–H protons can be obtained by considering the enthalpy changes accompanying proton transfer. We shall consider gas-phase proton transfer reactions first and then consider the effects of the solvent.

The simplest reaction of a proton is its attachment to a base, A − (which, although denoted here as a negatively charged species, could be a neutral molecule, such as NH3 ), in the gas phase:

A− (g) + H+ (g) → HA(g)

The standard enthalpy of this reaction is the proton-gain enthalpy, Δpg H − ○ − . The negative of this quantity is often reported as the proton affinity, A p (Table 5.2). When Δ pg H − ○ − is large and negative, corresponding to an exothermic proton attachment, the proton affinity is high, indicating strongly basic character in the gas phase. If the proton-gain enthalpy is only slightly negative, then the proton affinity is low, indicating a weaker basic (or more acidic) character.

The proton affinities of the conjugate bases of p-block binary acids HA decrease to the right along a period and down a group, indicating an increase in gas-phase acidity. Thus, HF is a stronger acid than H2 O and HI is the strongest acid of the hydrogen halides. In other words, the order of proton affinities of their conjugate bases is I − < OH − < F− . These trends can be explained by using a thermodynamic cycle such as that shown in Fig. 5.2 in which proton gain can be thought of as the outcome of three steps:

(the reverse of the ionization of H)

Combination of H and A: H(g) + A(g) → HA(g)−B(H−A)

(the reverse of H−A bond dissociation)

The proton-gain enthalpy of the conjugate base A − is the sum of these enthalpy changes:

Overall: H+ (g) + A− (g) → HA(g)

Δ pg H − ○ − (A− ) = Ae (A) − I(H) − B(H−A)

Therefore, the proton affinity of A is

Ap (A− ) = B(H−A) + I(H) − Ae (A)

(5.9)

The dominant factor in the variation in proton affinity across a period is the trend in electron affinity of A, which increases from left to right and hence lowers the proton affinity of A− . Thus, because the proton affinity of A − decreases, the gas-phase acidity of HA increases across a period as the electron affinity of A increases. Because increasing electron affinity correlates with increasing electronegativity (Section 1.7), the gas-phase acidity of HA FIGURE 5.2 Thermodynamic cycle for a proton gain reaction.

also increases as the electronegativity of A increases. The dominant factor when descending a group is the decrease in the H−A bond dissociation enthalpy, which lowers the proton affinity of A − and therefore increases the gas-phase acid strength of HA. The overall result of these effects is a decrease in gas-phase proton affinity of A− , and therefore to increase the gas-phase acidity of HA, from the top left to bottom right of the p-block. On this basis we see that HI is a much stronger acid than CH4 .

The correlation we have described is modified when a solvent (typically water) is present. The gas-phase process

A− (g) + H+ (g) → AH(g) becomes

and the negative of the accompanying proton-gain enthalpy is called the effective proton affinity, Ap ′, of A− (aq).

If the species A − denotes H2 O itself, the effective proton affinity of H2 O is the enthalpy change accompanying the process

H2 O(l) + H+ (aq) → H3 O+ (aq)

The energy released as water molecules are attached to a proton in the gas phase, as in the process



can be measured by mass spectrometry and used to assess the energy change for the hydration process in solution. It is found that the energy released passes through a maximum value of 1130 kJ mol − 1 as n increases, and this value is taken to be the effective proton affinity of H2 O in bulk water. The effective proton affinity of the ion OH − in water is simply the negative of the enthalpy of the reaction

OH− (g) + H+ (aq) → H2 O(l)

which can be measured by conventional means (such as the temperature dependence of its equilibrium constant, Kw ). The value found is 1188 kJ mol− 1.

The reaction

HA(aq) + H2 O(l) → H3 O+ (aq) + A− (aq)

is exothermic if the effective proton affinity of A− (aq) is lower than that of H2 O(l) (less than 1130 kJ mol− 1 ) and — provided entropy changes are negligible and enthalpy changes are a guide to spontaneity — HA will give up protons to the water and be strongly acidic. Likewise, the reaction

A− (aq) + H2 O(l) → HA(aq) + OH− (aq)

is exothermic if the effective proton affinity of A– (aq) is higher than that of OH− (aq) (1188 kJ mol− 1 ). Provided enthalpy changes are a guide to spontaneity, A− (aq) will accept protons and will act as a strong base.

A BRIEF ILLUSTRATION

The effective proton affinity of I − in water is 1068 kJ mol− 1  compared to 1314 kJ mol − 1 in the gas phase, showing that the I−  ion is stabilized by hydration. The effective proton affinity is also smaller than the effective proton affinity of water (1130 kJ mol− 1 ), which is consistent with the fact that HI is a strong acid in water. All the halide ions except F − have effective proton affinities smaller than that of water, which is consistent with all the hydrogen halides except HF being strong acids in water.

The effects of solvation can be rationalized in terms of an electrostatic model in which the solvent is treated as a continuous dielectric medium. The solvation of a gas-phase ion is always strongly exothermic. The magnitude of the enthalpy of solvation Δ solv H − ○ − (the enthalpy of hydration in water, Δ hyd H − ○ − ) depends on the radius of the ions, the relative permittivity of the solvent, and the possibility of specific bonding (especially hydrogen bonding) between the ions and the solvent.

When considering the gas phase we assume that entropy contributions for the proton transfer process are small and so Δ G − ○ − ≈ Δ H − ○ − . In solution, entropy effects cannot be ignored and we must use Δ G − ○ − . The Gibbs energy of solvation of an ion can be identified as the energy involved in transferring the anion from a vacuum into a solvent of relative permittivity εr . The Born equation can be derived using this model:2 

N A z 2 e 2  1  ∆solv G°= −  1 −  8πε 0 r  ε r 

(5.10)

where z is the charge number of the ion, r its effective radius which includes part of the radii of solvent molecules, N A is Avogadro's constant, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε r is the relative permittivity (the dielectric constant).

The Gibbs energy of solvation is proportional to z2 /r (known also as the electrostatic parameter, ξ) so small, highly

For the derivation of the Born equation, see P. Atkins and J. de Paula, Physical chemistry, Oxford University Press and W.H. Freeman & Co. (2014).

FIGURE 5.3 Correlation between Δsolv G − ○ − and the dimensionless electrostatic parameter ξ (= 100z2 /(r/pm)) for selected anions.

charged ions are stabilized in polar solvents (Fig. 5.3). The Born equation also shows that the larger the relative permittivity the more negative the value of Δ solv G − ○ − . This stabilization is particularly important for water, for which ε r = 80 (and the term in parentheses is close to 1), compared with nonpolar solvents for which ε r may be as low as 2 (and the term in parentheses is close to 0.5).

Because Δ solv G − ○ − is the change in molar Gibbs energy when an ion is transferred from the gas phase into aqueous solution, a large, negative value of Δ solv G − ○ − favours the formation of ions in solution compared with the gas phase (Fig. 5.3). The interaction of the charged ion with the polar solvent molecules stabilizes the conjugate base A − relative to the parent acid HA, and as a result the acidity of HA is enhanced by the polar solvent. On the other hand, the effective proton affinity of a neutral base B is higher than in the gas phase because the conjugate acid HB + is stabilized by solvation. Because a cationic acid, such as NH4 + , is stabilized by solvation, the effective proton affinity of its conjugate base (NH3 ) is higher than in the gas phase. The acidity of cationic acids is therefore lowered by a polar solvent.

The Born equation ascribes stabilization by solvation to Coulombic interactions. However, hydrogen bonding (Section 5.8) is an important factor in protic solvents such as water and leads to the formation of hydrogen-bonded clusters around some solutes. As a result, water has a greater stabilizing effect on small, highly charged ions than the Born equation predicts. This stabilizing effect is particularly great for F− , OH− , and Cl− , with their high charge densities and for which water acts as a hydrogen-bond donor. Because a water molecule has lone pairs of electrons on O, it can also be a hydrogen-bond acceptor. Acidic ions such as NH4 +  are stabilized by hydrogen bonding and consequently have a lower acidity than predicted by the Born equation.

## Characteristics of Brønsted acids

KEY POINT Aqua acids, hydroxoacids, and oxoacids are typical of specific regions of the periodic table.

We shall now concentrate on Brønsted acids and bases in water. We have focused the discussion so far on acids of the type HX. However, the largest class of acids in water consists of species that donate protons from an –OH group attached to a central atom. A donatable proton of this kind is called an acidic proton to distinguish it from other protons that may be present in the molecule, such as the nonacidic methyl protons in CH3 COOH.

There are three classes of acids to consider:
