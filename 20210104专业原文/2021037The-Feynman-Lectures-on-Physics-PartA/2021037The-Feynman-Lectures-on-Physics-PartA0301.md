The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences

3-1 IntroductionPhysics is the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sciences, and has hada profound eﬀect on all scientiﬁc development. In fact, physics is the present-dayequivalent of what used to be called natural philosophy, from which most of ourmodern sciences arose. Students of many ﬁelds ﬁnd themselves studying physicsbecause of the basic role it plays in all phenomena. In this chapter we shalltry to explain what the fundamental problems in the other sciences are, but ofcourse it is impossible in so small a space really to deal with the complex, subtle,beautiful matters in these other ﬁelds. Lack of space also prevents our discussingthe relation of physics to engineering, industry, society, and war, or even themost remarkable relationship between mathematics and physics. (Mathematics isnot a science from our point of view, in the sense that it is not a natural science.The test of its validity is not experiment.) We must, incidentally, make it clearfrom the beginning that if a thing is not a science, it is not necessarily bad. Forexample, love is not a science. So, if something is said not to be a science, it doesnot mean that there is something wrong with it; it just means that it is not ascience.

3-2 ChemistryThe science which is perhaps the most deeply aﬀected by physics is chemistry.Historically, the early days of chemistry dealt almost entirely with what we nowcall inorganic chemistry, the chemistry of substances which are not associatedwith living things. Considerable analysis was required to discover the existence ofthe many elements and their relationships—how they make the various relativelysimple compounds found in rocks, earth, etc. This early chemistry was veryimportant for physics. The interaction between the two sciences was very great

3-1

because the theory of atoms was substantiated to a large extent by experimentsin chemistry. The theory of chemistry, i.e., of the reactions themselves, wassummarized to a large extent in the periodic chart of Mendeleev, which brings outmany strange relationships among the various elements, and it was the collectionof rules as to which substance is combined with which, and how, that constitutedinorganic chemistry. All these rules were ultimately explained in principle byquantum mechanics, so that theoretical chemistry is in fact physics. On theother hand, it must be emphasized that this explanation is in principle. We havealready discussed the diﬀerence between knowing the rules of the game of chess,and being able to play. So it is that we may know the rules, but we cannot playvery well. It turns out to be very diﬃcult to predict precisely what will happen ina given chemical reaction; nevertheless, the deepest part of theoretical chemistrymust end up in quantum mechanics.

There is also a branch of physics and chemistry which was developed byboth sciences together, and which is extremely important. This is the methodof statistics applied in a situation in which there are mechanical laws, which isaptly called statistical mechanics. In any chemical situation a large number ofatoms are involved, and we have seen that the atoms are all jiggling around ina very random and complicated way. If we could analyze each collision, and beable to follow in detail the motion of each molecule, we might hope to ﬁgure outwhat would happen, but the many numbers needed to keep track of all thesemolecules exceeds so enormously the capacity of any computer, and certainlythe capacity of the mind, that it was important to develop a method for dealingwith such complicated situations. Statistical mechanics, then, is the science ofthe phenomena of heat, or thermodynamics. Inorganic chemistry is, as a science,now reduced essentially to what are called physical chemistry and quantumchemistry; physical chemistry to study the rates at which reactions occur andwhat is happening in detail (How do the molecules hit? Which pieces ﬂy oﬀ ﬁrst?,etc.), and quantum chemistry to help us understand what happens in terms ofthe physical laws.

The other branch of chemistry is organic chemistry, the chemistry of thesubstances which are associated with living things. For a time it was believed thatthe substances which are associated with living things were so marvelous thatthey could not be made by hand, from inorganic materials. This is not at all true—they are just the same as the substances made in inorganic chemistry, but morecomplicated arrangements of atoms are involved. Organic chemistry obviouslyhas a very close relationship to the biology which supplies its substances, and

3-2

to industry, and furthermore, much physical chemistry and quantum mechanicscan be applied to organic as well as to inorganic compounds. However, the mainproblems of organic chemistry are not in these aspects, but rather in the analysisand synthesis of the substances which are formed in biological systems, in livingthings. This leads imperceptibly, in steps, toward biochemistry, and then intobiology itself, or molecular biology.

3-3 BiologyThus we come to the science of biology, which is the study of living things. Inthe early days of biology, the biologists had to deal with the purely descriptiveproblem of ﬁnding out what living things there were, and so they just had tocount such things as the hairs of the limbs of ﬂeas. After these matters wereworked out with a great deal of interest, the biologists went into the machineryinside the living bodies, ﬁrst from a gross standpoint, naturally, because it takessome eﬀort to get into the ﬁner details.

There was an interesting early relationship between physics and biology inwhich biology helped physics in the discovery of the conservation of energy, whichwas ﬁrst demonstrated by Mayer in connection with the amount of heat taken inand given out by a living creature.

If we look at the processes of biology of living animals more closely, we seemany physical phenomena: the circulation of blood, pumps, pressure, etc. Thereare nerves: we know what is happening when we step on a sharp stone, andthat somehow or other the information goes from the leg up. It is interestinghow that happens. In their study of nerves, the biologists have come to theconclusion that nerves are very ﬁne tubes with a complex wall which is verythin; through this wall the cell pumps ions, so that there are positive ions on theoutside and negative ions on the inside, like a capacitor. Now this membrane hasan interesting property; if it「discharges」in one place, i.e., if some of the ionswere able to move through one place, so that the electric voltage is reduced there,that electrical inﬂuence makes itself felt on the ions in the neighborhood, and itaﬀects the membrane in such a way that it lets the ions through at neighboringpoints also. This in turn aﬀects it farther along, etc., and so there is a wave of「penetrability」of the membrane which runs down the ﬁber when it is「excited」at one end by stepping on the sharp stone. This wave is somewhat analogousto a long sequence of vertical dominoes; if the end one is pushed over, that onepushes the next, etc. Of course this will transmit only one message unless the

3-3

dominoes are set up again; and similarly in the nerve cell, there are processeswhich pump the ions slowly out again, to get the nerve ready for the next impulse.So it is that we know what we are doing (or at least where we are). Of coursethe electrical eﬀects associated with this nerve impulse can be picked up withelectrical instruments, and because there are electrical eﬀects, obviously thephysics of electrical eﬀects has had a great deal of inﬂuence on understandingthe phenomenon.

The opposite eﬀect is that, from somewhere in the brain, a message is sentout along a nerve. What happens at the end of the nerve? There the nervebranches out into ﬁne little things, connected to a structure near a muscle, calledan endplate. For reasons which are not exactly understood, when the impulsereaches the end of the nerve, little packets of a chemical called acetylcholine areshot oﬀ (ﬁve or ten molecules at a time) and they aﬀect the muscle ﬁber and makeit contract—how simple! What makes a muscle contract? A muscle is a verylarge number of ﬁbers close together, containing two diﬀerent substances, myosinand actomyosin, but the machinery by which the chemical reaction induced byacetylcholine can modify the dimensions of the muscle is not yet known. Thusthe fundamental processes in the muscle that make mechanical motions are notknown.

Biology is such an enormously wide ﬁeld that there are hosts of other problemsthat we cannot mention at all—problems on how vision works (what the lightdoes in the eye), how hearing works, etc. (The way in which thinking works weshall discuss later under psychology.) Now, these things concerning biology whichwe have just discussed are, from a biological standpoint, really not fundamental,at the bottom of life, in the sense that even if we understood them we still wouldnot understand life itself. To illustrate: the men who study nerves feel their workis very important, because after all you cannot have animals without nerves. Butyou can have life without nerves. Plants have neither nerves nor muscles, butthey are working, they are alive, just the same. So for the fundamental problemsof biology we must look deeper; when we do, we discover that all living thingshave a great many characteristics in common. The most common feature is thatthey are made of cells, within each of which is complex machinery for doingthings chemically. In plant cells, for example, there is machinery for picking uplight and generating glucose, which is consumed in the dark to keep the plantalive. When the plant is eaten the glucose itself generates in the animal a seriesof chemical reactions very closely related to photosynthesis (and its oppositeeﬀect in the dark) in plants.

3-4

In the cells of living systems there are many elaborate chemical reactions,in which one compound is changed into another and another. To give someimpression of the enormous eﬀorts that have gone into the study of biochemistry,the chart in Fig. 3-1 summarizes our knowledge to date on just one small part ofthe many series of reactions which occur in cells, perhaps a percent or so of it.Here we see a whole series of molecules which change from one to another in asequence or cycle of rather small steps. It is called the Krebs cycle, the respiratorycycle. Each of the chemicals and each of the steps is fairly simple, in terms ofwhat change is made in the molecule, but—and this is a centrally importantdiscovery in biochemistry—these changes are relatively diﬃcult to accomplishin a laboratory. If we have one substance and another very similar substance,the one does not just turn into the other, because the two forms are usuallyseparated by an energy barrier or「hill.」Consider this analogy: If we wantedto take an object from one place to another, at the same level but on the otherside of a hill, we could push it over the top, but to do so requires the addition ofsome energy. Thus most chemical reactions do not occur, because there is what

Fig. 3-1. The Krebs cycle.

3-5

is called an activation energy in the way. In order to add an extra atom to ourchemical requires that we get it close enough that some rearrangement can occur;then it will stick. But if we cannot give it enough energy to get it close enough,it will not go to completion, it will just go part way up the「hill」and back downagain. However, if we could literally take the molecules in our hands and pushand pull the atoms around in such a way as to open a hole to let the new atomin, and then let it snap back, we would have found another way, around the hill,which would not require extra energy, and the reaction would go easily. Nowthere actually are, in the cells, very large molecules, much larger than the oneswhose changes we have been describing, which in some complicated way holdthe smaller molecules just right, so that the reaction can occur easily. Thesevery large and complicated things are called enzymes. (They were ﬁrst calledferments, because they were originally discovered in the fermentation of sugar.In fact, some of the ﬁrst reactions in the cycle were discovered there.) In thepresence of an enzyme the reaction will go.

An enzyme is made of another substance called protein. Enzymes are verybig and complicated, and each one is diﬀerent, each being built to control acertain special reaction. The names of the enzymes are written in Fig. 3-1 at eachreaction. (Sometimes the same enzyme may control two reactions.) We emphasizethat the enzymes themselves are not involved in the reaction directly. They donot change; they merely let an atom go from one place to another. Having doneso, the enzyme is ready to do it to the next molecule, like a machine in a factory.Of course, there must be a supply of certain atoms and a way of disposing ofother atoms. Take hydrogen, for example: there are enzymes which have specialunits on them which carry the hydrogen for all chemical reactions. For example,there are three or four hydrogen-reducing enzymes which are used all over ourcycle in diﬀerent places. It is interesting that the machinery which liberates somehydrogen at one place will take that hydrogen and use it somewhere else.

The most important feature of the cycle of Fig. 3-1 is the transformationfrom GDP to GTP (guanosine-di-phosphate to guanosine-tri-phosphate) becausethe one substance has much more energy in it than the other. Just as thereis a「box」in certain enzymes for carrying hydrogen atoms around, there arespecial energy-carrying「boxes」which involve the triphosphate group. So, GTPhas more energy than GDP and if the cycle is going one way, we are producingmolecules which have extra energy and which can go drive some other cyclewhich requires energy, for example the contraction of muscle. The muscle willnot contract unless there is GTP. We can take muscle ﬁber, put it in water, and

3-6

add GTP, and the ﬁbers contract, changing GTP to GDP if the right enzymesare present. So the real system is in the GDP-GTP transformation; in the darkthe GTP which has been stored up during the day is used to run the whole cyclearound the other way. An enzyme, you see, does not care in which direction thereaction goes, for if it did it would violate one of the laws of physics.

Physics is of great importance in biology and other sciences for still anotherreason, that has to do with experimental techniques. In fact, if it were not forthe great development of experimental physics, these biochemistry charts wouldnot be known today. The reason is that the most useful tool of all for analyzingthis fantastically complex system is to label the atoms which are used in thereactions. Thus, if we could introduce into the cycle some carbon dioxide whichhas a「green mark」on it, and then measure after three seconds where the greenmark is, and again measure after ten seconds, etc., we could trace out the courseof the reactions. What are the「green marks」? They are diﬀerent isotopes. Werecall that the chemical properties of atoms are determined by the number ofelectrons, not by the mass of the nucleus. But there can be, for example incarbon, six neutrons or seven neutrons, together with the six protons which allcarbon nuclei have. Chemically, the two atoms C12 and C13 are the same, butthey diﬀer in weight and they have diﬀerent nuclear properties, and so they aredistinguishable. By using these isotopes of diﬀerent weights, or even radioactiveisotopes like C14, which provide a more sensitive means for tracing very smallquantities, it is possible to trace the reactions.

Now, we return to the description of enzymes and proteins. All proteins arenot enzymes, but all enzymes are proteins. There are many proteins, such as theproteins in muscle, the structural proteins which are, for example, in cartilageand hair, skin, etc., that are not themselves enzymes. However, proteins are avery characteristic substance of life: ﬁrst of all they make up all the enzymes, andsecond, they make up much of the rest of living material. Proteins have a veryinteresting and simple structure. They are a series, or chain, of diﬀerent aminoacids. There are twenty diﬀerent amino acids, and they all can combine with eachother to form chains in which the backbone is CO-NH, etc. Proteins are nothingbut chains of various ones of these twenty amino acids. Each of the amino acidsprobably serves some special purpose. Some, for example, have a sulfur atomat a certain place; when two sulfur atoms are in the same protein, they form abond, that is, they tie the chain together at two points and form a loop. Anotherhas extra oxygen atoms which make it an acidic substance, another has a basiccharacteristic. Some of them have big groups hanging out to one side, so that

3-7

they take up a lot of space. One of the amino acids, called proline, is not really anamino acid, but imino acid. There is a slight diﬀerence, with the result that whenproline is in the chain, there is a kink in the chain. If we wished to manufacturea particular protein, we would give these instructions: put one of those sulfurhooks here; next, add something to take up space; then attach something toput a kink in the chain. In this way, we will get a complicated-looking chain,hooked together and having some complex structure; this is presumably just themanner in which all the various enzymes are made. One of the great triumphsin recent times (since 1960), was at last to discover the exact spatial atomicarrangement of certain proteins, which involve some ﬁfty-six or sixty amino acidsin a row. Over a thousand atoms (more nearly two thousand, if we count thehydrogen atoms) have been located in a complex pattern in two proteins. Theﬁrst was hemoglobin. One of the sad aspects of this discovery is that we cannotsee anything from the pattern; we do not understand why it works the way itdoes. Of course, that is the next problem to be attacked.

Another problem is how do the enzymes know what to be? A red-eyed ﬂymakes a red-eyed ﬂy baby, and so the information for the whole pattern ofenzymes to make red pigment must be passed from one ﬂy to the next. This isdone by a substance in the nucleus of the cell, not a protein, called DNA (shortfor des-oxyribose nucleic acid). This is the key substance which is passed from onecell to another (for instance sperm cells consist mostly of DNA) and carries theinformation as to how to make the enzymes. DNA is the「blueprint.」What doesthe blueprint look like and how does it work? First, the blueprint must be ableto reproduce itself. Secondly, it must be able to instruct the protein. Concerningthe reproduction, we might think that this proceeds like cell reproduction. Cellssimply grow bigger and then divide in half. Must it be thus with DNA molecules,then, that they too grow bigger and divide in half? Every atom certainly doesnot grow bigger and divide in half! No, it is impossible to reproduce a moleculeexcept by some more clever way.

The structure of the substance DNA was studied for a long time, ﬁrst chemi-cally to ﬁnd the composition, and then with x-rays to ﬁnd the pattern in space.The result was the following remarkable discovery: The DNA molecule is a pairof chains, twisted upon each other. The backbone of each of these chains, whichare analogous to the chains of proteins but chemically quite diﬀerent, is a seriesof sugar and phosphate groups, as shown in Fig. 3-2. Now we see how the chaincan contain instructions, for if we could split this chain down the middle, wewould have a series BAADC . . . and every living thing could have a diﬀerent

3-8

series. Thus perhaps, in some way, the speciﬁc instructions for the manufactureof proteins are contained in the speciﬁc series of the DNA.

Attached to each sugar along the line, and linking the two chains together,are certain pairs of cross-links. However, they are not all of the same kind; thereare four kinds, called adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, but let us callthem A, B, C, and D. The interesting thing is that only certain pairs can sitopposite each other, for example A with B and C with D. These pairs are put onthe two chains in such a way that they「ﬁt together,」and have a strong energyof interaction. However, C will not ﬁt with A, and B will not ﬁt with C; theywill only ﬁt in pairs, A against B and C against D. Therefore if one is C, the

3-9

other must be D, etc. Whatever the letters may be in one chain, each one musthave its speciﬁc complementary letter on the other chain.What then about reproduction? Suppose we split this chain in two. How canwe make another one just like it? If, in the substances of the cells, there is amanufacturing department which brings up phosphate, sugar, and A, B, C, Dunits not connected in a chain, the only ones which will attach to our split chainwill be the correct ones, the complements of BAADC . . ., namely, ABBCD . . .Thus what happens is that the chain splits down the middle during cell division,one half ultimately to go with one cell, the other half to end up in the other cell;when separated, a new complementary chain is made by each half-chain.

Next comes the question, precisely how does the order of the A, B, C, D unitsdetermine the arrangement of the amino acids in the protein? This is the centralunsolved problem in biology today. The ﬁrst clues, or pieces of information,however, are these: There are in the cell tiny particles called ribosomes, and it isnow known that that is the place where proteins are made. But the ribosomesare not in the nucleus, where the DNA and its instructions are. Something seemsto be the matter. However, it is also known that little molecule pieces come oﬀthe DNA—not as long as the big DNA molecule that carries all the informationitself, but like a small section of it. This is called RNA, but that is not essential.It is a kind of copy of the DNA, a short copy. The RNA, which somehow carriesa message as to what kind of protein to make goes over to the ribosome; that isknown. When it gets there, protein is synthesized at the ribosome. That is alsoknown. However, the details of how the amino acids come in and are arranged inaccordance with a code that is on the RNA are, as yet, still unknown. We donot know how to read it. If we knew, for example, the「lineup」A, B, C, C, A,we could not tell you what protein is to be made.Certainly no subject or ﬁeld is making more progress on so many fronts atthe present moment, than biology, and if we were to name the most powerfulassumption of all, which leads one on and on in an attempt to understand life, itis that all things are made of atoms, and that everything that living things docan be understood in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of atoms.

3-4 AstronomyIn this rapid-ﬁre explanation of the whole world, we must now turn to astron-omy. Astronomy is older than physics. In fact, it got physics started by showingthe beautiful simplicity of the motion of the stars and planets, the understanding

3-10

of which was the beginning of physics. But the most remarkable discovery in allof astronomy is that the stars are made of atoms of the same kind as those on theearth.* How was this done? Atoms liberate light which has deﬁnite frequencies,something like the timbre of a musical instrument, which has deﬁnite pitches orfrequencies of sound. When we are listening to several diﬀerent tones we can tellthem apart, but when we look with our eyes at a mixture of colors we cannot tellthe parts from which it was made, because the eye is nowhere near as discerningas the ear in this connection. However, with a spectroscope we can analyze the fre-quencies of the light waves and in this way we can see the very tunes of the atomsthat are in the diﬀerent stars. As a matter of fact, two of the chemical elementswere discovered on a star before they were discovered on the earth. Helium wasdiscovered on the sun, whence its name, and technetium was discovered in certaincool stars. This, of course, permits us to make headway in understanding thestars, because they are made of the same kinds of atoms which are on the earth.Now we know a great deal about the atoms, especially concerning their behaviorunder conditions of high temperature but not very great density, so that wecan analyze by statistical mechanics the behavior of the stellar substance. Eventhough we cannot reproduce the conditions on the earth, using the basic physicallaws we often can tell precisely, or very closely, what will happen. So it is thatphysics aids astronomy. Strange as it may seem, we understand the distribution ofmatter in the interior of the sun far better than we understand the interior of theearth. What goes on inside a star is better understood than one might guess fromthe diﬃculty of having to look at a little dot of light through a telescope, becausewe can calculate what the atoms in the stars should do in most circumstances.One of the most impressive discoveries was the origin of the energy of thestars, that makes them continue to burn. One of the men who discovered this

* How I’m rushing through this! How much each sentence in this brief story contains.「Thestars are made of the same atoms as the earth.」I usually pick one small topic like this to give alecture on. Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars—mere globs of gas atoms.Nothing is「mere.」I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see lessor more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination—stuck on this carousel mylittle eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern—of which I am a part—perhapsmy stuﬀ was belched from some forgotten star, as one is belching there. Or see them with thegreater eye of Palomar, rushing all apart from some common starting point when they wereperhaps all together. What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm tothe mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists ofthe past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets whocan speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methaneand ammonia must be silent?

3-11

was out with his girl friend the night after he realized that nuclear reactionsmust be going on in the stars in order to make them shine. She said「Look athow pretty the stars shine!」He said「Yes, and right now I am the only man inthe world who knows why they shine.」She merely laughed at him. She was notimpressed with being out with the only man who, at that moment, knew whystars shine. Well, it is sad to be alone, but that is the way it is in this world.

It is the nuclear「burning」of hydrogen which supplies the energy of the sun;the hydrogen is converted into helium. Furthermore, ultimately, the manufactureof various chemical elements proceeds in the centers of the stars, from hydrogen.The stuﬀ of which we are made, was「cooked」once, in a star, and spit out. Howdo we know? Because there is a clue. The proportion of the diﬀerent isotopes—how much C12, how much C13, etc., is something which is never changed bychemical reactions, because the chemical reactions are so much the same for thetwo. The proportions are purely the result of nuclear reactions. By lookingat the proportions of the isotopes in the cold, dead ember which we are, wecan discover what the furnace was like in which the stuﬀ of which we are madewas formed. That furnace was like the stars, and so it is very likely that ourelements were「made」in the stars and spit out in the explosions which we callnovae and supernovae. Astronomy is so close to physics that we shall study manyastronomical things as we go along.

3-5 GeologyWe turn now to what are called earth sciences, or geology. First, meteorologyand the weather. Of course the instruments of meteorology are physical instru-ments, and the development of experimental physics made these instrumentspossible, as was explained before. However, the theory of meteorology has neverbeen satisfactorily worked out by the physicist.「Well,」you say,「there is nothingbut air, and we know the equations of the motions of air.」Yes we do.「So if weknow the condition of air today, why can’t we ﬁgure out the condition of the airtomorrow?」First, we do not really know what the condition is today, becausethe air is swirling and twisting everywhere. It turns out to be very sensitive, andeven unstable. If you have ever seen water run smoothly over a dam, and thenturn into a large number of blobs and drops as it falls, you will understand whatI mean by unstable. You know the condition of the water before it goes over thespillway; it is perfectly smooth; but the moment it begins to fall, where do thedrops begin? What determines how big the lumps are going to be and where

3-12

they will be? That is not known, because the water is unstable. Even a smoothmoving mass of air, in going over a mountain turns into complex whirlpools andeddies. In many ﬁelds we ﬁnd this situation of turbulent ﬂow that we cannotanalyze today. Quickly we leave the subject of weather, and discuss geology!The question basic to geology is, what makes the earth the way it is? Themost obvious processes are in front of your very eyes, the erosion processes ofthe rivers, the winds, etc. It is easy enough to understand these, but for everybit of erosion there is an equal amount of something else going on. Mountainsare no lower today, on the average, than they were in the past. There mustbe mountain-forming processes. You will ﬁnd, if you study geology, that thereare mountain-forming processes and volcanism, which nobody understands butwhich is half of geology. The phenomenon of volcanoes is really not understood.What makes an earthquake is, ultimately, not understood. It is understoodthat if something is pushing something else, it snaps and will slide—that is allright. But what pushes, and why? The theory is that there are currents insidethe earth—circulating currents, due to the diﬀerence in temperature inside andoutside—which, in their motion, push the surface slightly. Thus if there are twoopposite circulations next to each other, the matter will collect in the regionwhere they meet and make belts of mountains which are in unhappy stressedconditions, and so produce volcanoes and earthquakes.

What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about the speed ofearthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth.However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense asubstance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of theearth. In other words, we cannot ﬁgure out the properties of matter very well inthese circumstances. We do much less well with the earth than we do with theconditions of matter in the stars. The mathematics involved seems a little toodiﬃcult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes thatit is an important problem, and really works it out. The other aspect, of course,is that even if we did know the density, we cannot ﬁgure out the circulatingcurrents. Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure.We cannot tell how fast the rocks should「give」; that must all be worked out byexperiment.

3-6 PsychologyNext, we consider the science of psychology.

Incidentally, psychoanalysisit is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like

is not a science:

3-13

witch-doctoring. It has a theory as to what causes disease—lots of diﬀerent「spirits,」etc. The witch doctor has a theory that a disease like malaria is causedby a spirit which comes into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it,but quinine does help malaria. So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go tothe witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows the most aboutthe disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is not science. Psychoanalysis hasnot been checked carefully by experiment, and there is no way to ﬁnd a list ofthe number of cases in which it works, the number of cases in which it does notwork, etc.

The other branches of psychology, which involve things like the physiologyof sensation—what happens in the eye, and what happens in the brain—are, ifyou wish, less interesting. But some small but real progress has been made instudying them. One of the most interesting technical problems may or may notbe called psychology. The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervoussystem, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do something diﬀerentthan it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made outof atoms. In what way is it diﬀerent? We do not know where to look, or whatto look for, when something is memorized. We do not know what it means, orwhat change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is avery important problem which has not been solved at all. Assuming, however,that there is some kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous massof interconnecting wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in astraightforward manner. There is an analog of this to computing machines andcomputing elements, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have somekind of element, analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerveto another. This is a very interesting subject which we have not the time todiscuss further—the relationship between thinking and computing machines. Itmust be appreciated, of course, that this subject will tell us very little about thereal complexities of ordinary human behavior. All human beings are so diﬀerent.It will be a long time before we get there. We must start much further back. Ifwe could even ﬁgure out how a dog works, we would have gone pretty far. Dogsare easier to understand, but nobody yet knows how dogs work.

3-7 How did it get that way?In order for physics to be useful to other sciences in a theoretical way, otherthan in the invention of instruments, the science in question must supply to the

3-14

physicist a description of the object in a physicist’s language. They can say「whydoes a frog jump?,」and the physicist cannot answer. If they tell him what a frogis, that there are so many molecules, there is a nerve here, etc., that is diﬀerent.If they will tell us, more or less, what the earth or the stars are like, then wecan ﬁgure it out. In order for physical theory to be of any use, we must knowwhere the atoms are located. In order to understand the chemistry, we mustknow exactly what atoms are present, for otherwise we cannot analyze it. Thatis but one limitation, of course.

There is another kind of problem in the sister sciences which does not exist inphysics; we might call it, for lack of a better term, the historical question. Howdid it get that way? If we understand all about biology, we will want to know howall the things which are on the earth got there. There is the theory of evolution,an important part of biology. In geology, we not only want to know how themountains are forming, but how the entire earth was formed in the beginning,the origin of the solar system, etc. That, of course, leads us to want to knowwhat kind of matter there was in the world. How did the stars evolve? Whatwere the initial conditions? That is the problem of astronomical history. A greatdeal has been found out about the formation of stars, the formation of elementsfrom which we were made, and even a little about the origin of the universe.

There is no historical question being studied in physics at the present time.We do not have a question,「Here are the laws of physics, how did they get thatway?」We do not imagine, at the moment, that the laws of physics are somehowchanging with time, that they were diﬀerent in the past than they are at present.Of course they may be, and the moment we ﬁnd they are, the historical questionof physics will be wrapped up with the rest of the history of the universe, and thenthe physicist will be talking about the same problems as astronomers, geologists,and biologists.

Finally, there is a physical problem that is common to many ﬁelds, that is veryold, and that has not been solved. It is not the problem of ﬁnding new fundamentalparticles, but something left over from a long time ago—over a hundred years.Nobody in physics has really been able to analyze it mathematically satisfactorilyin spite of its importance to the sister sciences. It is the analysis of circulating orturbulent ﬂuids. If we watch the evolution of a star, there comes a point where wecan deduce that it is going to start convection, and thereafter we can no longerdeduce what should happen. A few million years later the star explodes, but wecannot ﬁgure out the reason. We cannot analyze the weather. We do not knowthe patterns of motions that there should be inside the earth. The simplest form

of the problem is to take a pipe that is very long and push water through it athigh speed. We ask: to push a given amount of water through that pipe, howmuch pressure is needed? No one can analyze it from ﬁrst principles and theproperties of water. If the water ﬂows very slowly, or if we use a thick goo likehoney, then we can do it nicely. You will ﬁnd that in your textbook. What wereally cannot do is deal with actual, wet water running through a pipe. That isthe central problem which we ought to solve some day, and we have not.

A poet once said,「The whole universe is in a glass of wine.」We will probablynever know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood.But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see theentire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid whichevaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reﬂections in the glass, andour imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks,and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolutionof stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they cometo be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products.There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobodycan discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, thecause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into theconsciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, dividethis glass of wine, this universe, into parts—physics, biology, geology, astronomy,psychology, and so on—remember that nature does not know it! So let us putit all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us onemore ﬁnal pleasure: drink it and forget it all!
