The Laws of Thermodynamics

44-1 Heat engines; the ﬁrst lawSo far we have been discussing the properties of matter from the atomicpoint of view, trying to understand roughly what will happen if we suppose thatthings are made of atoms obeying certain laws. However, there are a number ofrelationships among the properties of substances which can be worked out withoutconsideration of the detailed structure of the materials. The determination of therelationships among the various properties of materials, without knowing theirinternal structure, is the subject of thermodynamics. Historically, thermodynamicswas developed before an understanding of the internal structure of matter wasachieved.

To give an example: we know from the kinetic theory that the pressure of a gasis caused by molecular bombardment, and we know that if we heat a gas, so thatthe bombardment increases, the pressure must increase. Conversely, if the pistonin a container of the gas is moved inward against the force of bombardment, theenergy of the molecules bombarding the piston will increase, and consequently thetemperature will increase. So, on the one hand, if we increase the temperature ata given volume, we increase the pressure. On the other hand, if we compress thegas, we will ﬁnd that the temperature will rise. From the kinetic theory, one canderive a quantitative relationship between these two eﬀects, but instinctively onemight guess that they are related in some necessary fashion which is independentof the details of the collisions.

Let us consider another example. Many people are familiar with this interestingproperty of rubber: If we take a rubber band and pull it, it gets warm. If oneputs it between his lips, for example, and pulls it out, he can feel a distinctwarming, and this warming is reversible in the sense that if he relaxes the rubberband quickly while it is between his lips, it is distinctly cooled. That means thatwhen we stretch a rubber band it heats, and when we release the tension of the

44-1

band it cools. Now our instincts might suggest that if we heated a band, it mightpull: that the fact that pulling a band heats it might imply that heating a bandshould cause it to contract. And, in fact, if we apply a gas ﬂame to a rubberband holding a weight, we will see that the band contracts abruptly (Fig. 44-1).So it is true that when we heat a rubber band it pulls, and this fact is deﬁnitelyrelated to the fact that when we release the tension of it, it cools.

The internal machinery of rubber that causes these eﬀects is quite complicated.We will describe it from a molecular point of view to some extent, although ourmain purpose in this chapter is to understand the relationship of these eﬀectsindependently of the molecular model. Nevertheless, we can show from themolecular model that the eﬀects are closely related. One way to understand thebehavior of rubber is to recognize that this substance consists of an enormoustangle of long chains of molecules, a kind of「molecular spaghetti,」with one extracomplication: between the chains there are cross-links—like spaghetti that issometimes welded together where it crosses another piece of spaghetti—a grandtangle. When we pull out such a tangle, some of the chains tend to line up alongthe direction of the pull. At the same time, the chains are in thermal motion, sothey hit each other continually. It follows that such a chain, if stretched, wouldnot by itself remain stretched, because it would be hit from the sides by the otherchains and other molecules, and would tend to kink up again. So the real reasonwhy a rubber band tends to contract is this: when one pulls it out, the chains arelengthwise, and the thermal agitations of the molecules on the sides of the chainstend to kink the chains up, and make them shorten. One can then appreciatethat if the chains are held stretched and the temperature is increased, so thatthe vigor of the bombardment on the sides of the chains is also increased, thechains tend to pull in, and they are able to pull a stronger weight when heated.If, after being stretched for a time, a rubber band is allowed to relax, each chain

44-2

becomes soft, and the molecules striking it lose energy as they pound into therelaxing chain. So the temperature falls.

We have seen how these two processes, contraction when heated and coolingduring relaxation, can be related by the kinetic theory, but it would be a tremen-dous challenge to determine from the theory the precise relationship between thetwo. We would have to know how many collisions there were each second andwhat the chains look like, and we would have to take account of all kinds of othercomplications. The detailed mechanism is so complex that we cannot, by kinetictheory, really determine exactly what happens; still, a deﬁnite relation betweenthe two eﬀects we observe can be worked out without knowing anything aboutthe internal machinery!

The whole subject of thermodynamics depends essentially upon the followingkind of consideration: because a rubber band is「stronger」at higher temperaturesthan it is at lower temperatures, it ought to be possible to lift weights, and tomove them around, and thus to do work with heat. In fact, we have already seenexperimentally that a heated rubber band can lift a weight. The study of the waythat one does work with heat is the beginning of the science of thermodynamics.Can we make an engine which uses the heating eﬀect on a rubber band to do work?One can make a silly looking engine that does just this. It consists of a bicyclewheel in which all the spokes are rubber bands (Fig. 44-2). If one heats the rubberbands on one side of the wheel with a pair of heat lamps, they become「stronger」than the rubber bands on the other side. The center of gravity of the wheel will

44-3

be pulled to one side, away from the bearing, so that the wheel turns. As it turns,cool rubber bands move toward the heat, and the heated bands move away fromthe heat and cool, so that the wheel turns slowly so long as the heat is applied. Theeﬃciency of this engine is extremely low. Four hundred watts of power pour intothe two lamps, but it is just possible to lift a ﬂy with such an engine! An interestingquestion, however, is whether we can get heat to do the work in more eﬃcient ways.In fact, the science of thermodynamics began with an analysis, by the greatengineer Sadi Carnot, of the problem of how to build the best and most eﬃcientengine, and this constitutes one of the few famous cases in which engineeringhas contributed fundamentally to physical theory. Another example that comesto mind is the more recent analysis of information theory by Claude Shannon.These two analyses, incidentally, turn out to be closely related.

Now the way a steam engine ordinarily operates is that heat from a ﬁreboils some water, and the steam so formed expands and pushes on a pistonwhich makes a wheel go around. So the steam pushes the piston—what then?One has to ﬁnish the job: a stupid way to complete the cycle would be to letthe steam escape into the air, for then one has to keep supplying water. Itis cheaper—more eﬃcient—to let the steam go into another box, where it iscondensed by cool water, and then pump the water back into the boiler, so thatit circulates continuously. Heat is thus supplied to the engine and converted intowork. Now would it be better to use alcohol? What property should a substancehave so that it makes the best possible engine? That was the question to whichCarnot addressed himself, and one of the by-products was the discovery of thetype of relationship that we have just explained above.

The results of thermodynamics are all contained implicitly in certain appar-ently simple statements called the laws of thermodynamics. At the time whenCarnot lived, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy, wasnot known. Carnot’s arguments were so carefully drawn, however, that they arevalid even though the ﬁrst law was not known in his time! Some time afterwards,Clapeyron made a simpler derivation that could be understood more easily thanCarnot’s very subtle reasoning. But it turned out that Clapeyron assumed, notthe conservation of energy in general, but that heat was conserved according tothe caloric theory, which was later shown to be false. So it has often been saidthat Carnot’s logic was wrong. But his logic was quite correct. Only Clapeyron’ssimpliﬁed version, that everybody read, was incorrect.

The so-called second law of thermodynamics was thus discovered by Carnotbefore the ﬁrst law! It would be interesting to give Carnot’s argument that did

44-4

not use the ﬁrst law, but we shall not do so because we want to learn physics,not history. We shall use the ﬁrst law from the start, in spite of the fact that agreat deal can be done without it.

Let us begin by stating the ﬁrst law, the conservation of energy: if one has asystem and puts heat into it, and does work on it, then its energy is increased bythe heat put in and the work done. We can write this as follows: The heat Qput into the system, plus the work W done on the system, is the increase in theenergy U of the system; the latter energy is sometimes called the internal energy:(44.1)

Change in U = Q + W.

The change in U can be represented as adding a little heat ∆Q and adding alittle work ∆W:

(44.2)which is a diﬀerential form of the same law. We know that very well, from anearlier chapter.

∆U = ∆Q + ∆W,

44-2 The second lawNow, what about the second law of thermodynamics? We know that if wedo work against friction, say, the work lost to us is equal to the heat produced.If we do work in a room at temperature T, and we do the work slowly enough,the room temperature does not change much, and we have converted work intoheat at a given temperature. What about the reverse possibility? Is it possibleto convert the heat back into work at a given temperature? The second law ofthermodynamics asserts that it is not. It would be very convenient to be able toconvert heat into work merely by reversing a process like friction. If we consideronly the conservation of energy, we might think that heat energy, such as that inthe vibrational motions of molecules, might provide a goodly supply of usefulenergy. But Carnot assumed that it is impossible to extract the energy of heatat a single temperature. In other words, if the whole world were at the sametemperature, one could not convert any of its heat energy into work: while theprocess of making work go into heat can take place at a given temperature, onecannot reverse it to get the work back again. Speciﬁcally, Carnot assumed thatheat cannot be taken in at a certain temperature and converted into work withno other change in the system or the surroundings.

44-5

That last phrase is very important. Suppose we have a can of compressedair at a certain temperature, and we let the air expand. It can do work; it canmake hammers go, for example. It cools oﬀ a little in the expansion, but if wehad a big sea, like the ocean, at a given temperature—a heat reservoir—we couldwarm it up again. So we have taken the heat out of the sea, and we have donework with the compressed air. But Carnot was not wrong, because we did notleave everything as it was. If we recompress the air that we let expand, we willﬁnd we are doing extra work, and when we are ﬁnished we will discover that wenot only got no work out of the system at temperature T, but we actually putsome in. We must talk only about situations in which the net result of the wholeprocess is to take heat away and convert it into work, just as the net result of theprocess of doing work against friction is to take work and convert it into heat. Ifwe move in a circle, we can bring the system back precisely to its starting point,with the net result that we did work against friction and produced heat. Can wereverse the process? Turn a switch, so that everything goes backwards, so thefriction does work against us, and cools the sea? According to Carnot: no! Solet us suppose that this is impossible.

If it were possible it would mean, among other things, that we could takeheat out of a cold body and put it into a hot body at no cost, as it were. Nowwe know it is natural that a hot thing can warm up a cool thing; if we simplyput a hot body and a cold one together, and change nothing else, our experienceassures us that it is not going to happen that the hot one gets hotter, and thecold one gets colder! But if we could obtain work by extracting the heat out ofthe ocean, say, or from anything else at a single temperature, then that workcould be converted back into heat by friction at some other temperature. Forinstance, the other arm of a working machine could be rubbing something that isalready hot. The net result would be to take heat from a「cold」body, the ocean,and to put it into a hot body. Now, the hypothesis of Carnot, the second lawof thermodynamics, is sometimes stated as follows: heat cannot, of itself, ﬂowfrom a cold to a hot object. But, as we have just seen, these two statements areequivalent: ﬁrst, that one cannot devise a process whose only result is to convertheat to work at a single temperature, and second, that one cannot make heatﬂow by itself from a cold to a hot place. We shall mostly use the ﬁrst form.

Carnot’s analysis of heat engines is quite similar to the argument that wegave about weight-lifting engines in our discussion of the conservation of energyin Chapter 4. In fact, that argument was patterned after Carnot’s argumentabout heat engines, and so the present treatment will sound very much the same.

44-6

Fig. 44-3. Heat engine.

Suppose we build a heat engine that has a「boiler」somewhere at a temper-ature T1. A certain heat Q1 is taken from the boiler, the steam engine doessome work W, and it then delivers some heat Q2 into a「condenser」at anothertemperature T2 (Fig. 44-3). Carnot did not say how much heat, because he didnot know the ﬁrst law, and he did not use the law that Q2 was equal to Q1because he did not believe it. Although everybody thought that, according tothe caloric theory, the heats Q1 and Q2 would have to be the same, Carnot didnot say they were the same—that is part of the cleverness of his argument. If wedo use the ﬁrst law, we ﬁnd that the heat delivered, Q2, is the heat Q1 that wasput in minus the work W that was done:

Q2 = Q1 − W.

(44.3)

(If we have some kind of cyclic process where water is pumped back into the boilerafter it is condensed, we will say that we have heat Q1 absorbed and work Wdone, during each cycle, for a certain amount of water that goes around thecycle.)

Now we shall build another engine, and see if we cannot get more workfrom the same amount of heat being delivered at the temperature T1, with thecondenser still at the temperature T2. We shall use the same amount of heat Q1from the boiler, and we shall try to get more work than we did out of the steamengine, perhaps by using another ﬂuid, such as alcohol.

44-3 Reversible enginesNow we must analyze our engines. One thing is clear: we will lose somethingif the engines contain devices in which there is friction. The best engine will bea frictionless engine. We assume, then, the same idealization that we did whenwe studied the conservation of energy; that is, a perfectly frictionless engine.

We must also consider the analog of frictionless motion,「frictionless」heattransfer. If we put a hot object at a high temperature against a cold object, so

44-7

Fig. 44-4. Reversible heat transfer.

that the heat ﬂows, then it is not possible to make that heat ﬂow in a reversedirection by a very small change in the temperature of either object. But whenwe have a practically frictionless machine, if we push it with a little force oneway, it goes that way, and if we push it with a little force the other way, it goesthe other way. We need to ﬁnd the analog of frictionless motion: heat transferwhose direction we can reverse with only a tiny change. If the diﬀerence intemperature is ﬁnite, that is impossible, but if one makes sure that heat ﬂowsalways between two things at essentially the same temperature, with just aninﬁnitesimal diﬀerence to make it ﬂow in the desired direction, the ﬂow is said tobe reversible (Fig. 44-4). If we heat the object on the left a little, heat will ﬂow tothe right; if we cool it a little, heat will ﬂow to the left. So we ﬁnd that the idealengine is a so-called reversible engine, in which every process is reversible in thesense that, by minor changes, inﬁnitesimal changes, we can make the engine goin the opposite direction. That means that nowhere in the machine must therebe any appreciable friction, and nowhere in the machine must there be any placewhere the heat of the reservoirs, or the ﬂame of the boiler, is in direct contactwith something deﬁnitely cooler or warmer.

Let us now consider an idealized engine in which all the processes are reversible.To show that such a thing is possible in principle, we will give an example of anengine cycle which may or may not be practical, but which is at least reversible,in the sense of Carnot’s idea. Suppose that we have a gas in a cylinder equippedwith a frictionless piston. The gas is not necessarily a perfect gas. The ﬂuid doesnot even have to be a gas, but to be speciﬁc let us say we do have a perfect gas.Also, suppose that we have two heat pads, T1 and T2—great big things that havedeﬁnite temperatures, T1 and T2. We will suppose in this case that T1 is higherthan T2. Let us ﬁrst heat the gas and at the same time expand it, while it is

44-8

Fig. 44-5. Steps in Carnot cycle.

in contact with the heat pad at T1. As we do this, pulling the piston out veryslowly as the heat ﬂows into the gas, we will make sure that the temperatureof the gas never gets very far from T1. If we pull the piston out too fast, thetemperature of the gas will fall too much below T1 and then the process will notbe quite reversible, but if we pull it out slowly enough, the temperature of the gaswill never depart much from T1. On the other hand, if we push the piston backslowly, the temperature would be only inﬁnitesimally higher than T1, and the

44-9

heat would pour back. We see that such an isothermal (constant-temperature)expansion, done slowly and gently enough, is a reversible process.

To understand what we are doing, we shall use a plot (Fig. 44-6) of the pressureof the gas against its volume. As the gas expands, the pressure falls. The curvemarked (1) tells us how the pressure and volume change if the temperature iskept ﬁxed at the value T1. For an ideal gas this curve would be P V = N kT1.During an isothermal expansion the pressure falls as the volume increases untilwe stop at the point b. At the same time, a certain heat Q1 must ﬂow into the gasfrom the reservoir, for if the gas were expanded without being in contact with thereservoir it would cool oﬀ, as we already know. Having completed the isothermalexpansion, stopping at the point b, let us take the cylinder away from the reservoirand continue the expansion. This time we permit no heat to enter the cylinder.Again we perform the expansion slowly, so there is no reason why we cannotreverse it, and we again assume there is no friction. The gas continues to expandand the temperature falls, since there is no longer any heat entering the cylinder.We let the gas expand, following the curve marked (2), until the temperaturefalls to T2, at the point marked c. This kind of expansion, made without addingheat, is called an adiabatic expansion. For an ideal gas, we already know thatcurve (2) has the form P V γ = constant, where γ is a constant greater than 1, sothat the adiabatic curve has a more negative slope than the isothermal curve.The gas cylinder has now reached the temperature T2, so that if we put it on theheat pad at temperature T2 there will be no irreversible changes. Now we slowly

44-10

Fig. 44-7. Reversible engine A being driven backwards by engine B.

compress the gas while it is in contact with the reservoir at T2, following thecurve marked (3) (Fig. 44-5, Step 3). Because the cylinder is in contact with thereservoir, the temperature does not rise, but heat Q2 ﬂows from the cylinder intothe reservoir at the temperature T2. Having compressed the gas isothermallyalong curve (3) to the point d, we remove the cylinder from the heat pad attemperature T2 and compress it still further, without letting any heat ﬂow out.The temperature will rise, and the pressure will follow the curve marked (4). Ifwe carry out each step properly, we can return to the point a at temperature T1where we started, and repeat the cycle.

We see that on this diagram we have carried the gas around a complete cycle,and during one cycle we have put Q1 in at temperature T1, and have removed Q2at temperature T2. Now the point is that this cycle is reversible, so that we couldrepresent all the steps the other way around. We could have gone backwardsinstead of forwards: we could have started at point a, at temperature T1, expandedalong the curve (4), expanded further at the temperature T2, absorbing heat Q2,and so on, going around the cycle backward. If we go around the cycle in onedirection, we must do work on the gas; if we go in the other direction, the gasdoes work on us.

Incidentally, it is easy to ﬁnd out what the total amount of work is, because

the work during any expansion is the pressure times the change in volume,R P dV .if we call the vertical distance y and the horizontal distance x, this isR y dx—in

On this particular diagram, we have plotted P vertically and V horizontally. Soother words, the area under the curve. So the area under each of the numberedcurves is a measure of the work done by or on the gas in the corresponding step.It is easy to see that the net work done is the shaded area of the picture.

44-11

Now that we have given a single example of a reversible machine, we shallsuppose that other such engines are also possible. Let us assume that we havea reversible engine A which takes Q1 at T1, does work W, and delivers someheat at T2. Now let us assume we have any other engine B, made by man,already designed or not yet invented, made of rubber bands, steam, or whatever,reversible or not, which is designed so that it takes in the same amount of heat Q1at T1, and rejects the heat at the lower temperature T2 (Fig. 44-7). Assumethat engine B does some work, W 0. Now we shall show that W 0 is not greaterthan W—that no engine can do more work than a reversible one. Why? Supposethat, indeed, W 0 were bigger than W. Then we could take the heat Q1 out ofthe reservoir at T1, and with engine B we could do work W 0 and deliver someheat to the reservoir at T2; we do not care how much. That done, we could savesome of the work W 0, which is supposed to be greater than W; we could usea part of it, W, and save the remainder, W 0 − W, for useful work. With thework W we could run engine A backwards because it is a reversible engine. It willabsorb some heat from the reservoir at T2 and deliver Q1 back to the reservoirat T1. After this double cycle, the net result would be that we would have puteverything back the way it was before, and we would have done some excesswork, namely W 0 − W, and all we would have done would be to extract energyfrom the reservoir at T2! We were careful to restore the heat Q1 to the reservoirat T1. So that reservoir can be small and「inside」our combined machine A + B,whose net eﬀect is therefore to extract a net heat W 0 − W from the reservoirat T2 and convert it into work. But to obtain useful work from a reservoir at asingle temperature with no other changes is impossible according to Carnot’spostulate; it cannot be done. Therefore no engine which absorbs a given amountof heat from a higher temperature T1 and delivers it at the temperature T2 cando more work than a reversible engine operating under the same temperatureconditions.

Now suppose that engine B is also reversible. Then, of course, not only mustW 0 be not greater than W, but now we can reverse the argument and show thatW cannot be greater than W 0. So, if both engines are reversible they must bothdo the same amount of work, and we thus come to Carnot’s brilliant conclusion:that if an engine is reversible, it makes no diﬀerence how it is designed, becausethe amount of work one will obtain if the engine absorbs a given amount ofheat at temperature T1 and delivers heat at some other temperature T2 does notdepend on the design of the engine. It is a property of the world, not a propertyof a particular engine.

44-12

If we could ﬁnd out what the law is that determines how much work we obtainwhen we absorb the heat Q1 at T1 and deliver heat at T2, this quantity wouldbe a universal thing, independent of the substance. Of course if we knew theproperties of a particular substance, we could work it out and then say that allother substances must give the same amount of work in a reversible engine. Thatis the key idea, the clue by which we can ﬁnd the relationship between how much,for instance, a rubber band contracts when we heat it, and how much it coolswhen we let it contract. Imagine that we put that rubber band in a reversiblemachine, and that we make it go around a reversible cycle. The net result, thetotal amount of work done, is that universal function, that great function whichis independent of substance. So we see that a substance’s properties must belimited in a certain way; one cannot make up anything he wants, or he would beable to invent a substance which he could use to produce more than the maximumallowable work when he carried it around a reversible cycle. This principle, thislimitation, is the only real rule that comes out of the thermodynamics.

44-4 The eﬃciency of an ideal engineNow we shall try to ﬁnd the law which determines the work W as a functionof Q1, T1, and T2. It is clear that W is proportional to Q1, for if we consider tworeversible engines in parallel, both working together and both double engines,the combination is also a reversible engine. If each one absorbed heat Q1, thetwo together absorb 2Q1 and the work done is 2W, and so on. So it is notunreasonable that W is proportional to Q1.Now the next important step is to ﬁnd this universal law. We can, and will,do so by studying a reversible engine with the one particular substance whoselaws we know, a perfect gas. It is also possible to obtain the rule by a purelylogical argument, using no particular substance at all. This is one of the verybeautiful pieces of reasoning in physics and we are reluctant not to show it to you,so for those who would like to see it we shall discuss it in just a moment. Butﬁrst we shall use the much less abstract and simpler method of direct calculationfor a perfect gas.We need only obtain formulas for Q1 and Q2 (for W is just Q1−Q2), the heatsexchanged with the reservoirs during the isothermal expansion or contraction.For example, how much heat Q1 is absorbed from the reservoir at temperature T1during the isothermal expansion [marked (1) in Fig. 44-6] from point a, atpressure pa, volume Va, temperature T1, to point b with pressure pb, volume Vb,

44-13

and the same temperature T1? For a perfect gas each molecule has an energy thatdepends only on the temperature, and since the temperature and the number ofmolecules are the same at a and at b, the internal energy is the same. There isno change in U; all the work done by the gas,

is the heat taken from the reservoir at T1. In the same way, for the compressionat T2 [curve (3) of Fig. 44-6] the heat delivered to the reservoir at T2 is

Q2 = N kT2 ln VcVd

.

(44.5)

To ﬁnish our analysis we need only ﬁnd a relation between Vc/Vd and Vb/Va.This we do by noting that (2) is an adiabatic expansion from b to c, during whichpV γ is a constant. Since pV = N kT, we can write this as (pV )V γ−1 = const or,in terms of T and V , as T V γ−1 = const, or

Likewise, since (4), the compression from d to a, is also adiabatic, we ﬁnd

(44.6a)If we divide this equation by the previous one, we ﬁnd that Vb/Va must equal Vc/Vd,so the ln’s in (44.4) and (44.5) are equal, and that

This is the relation we were seeking. Although proved for a perfect gas engine,we know it must be true for any reversible engine at all.Now we shall see how this universal law could also be obtained by logicalargument, without knowing the properties of any speciﬁc substances, as follows.Suppose that we have three engines and three temperatures, let us say T1, T2,and T3. Let one engine absorb heat Q1 from the temperature T1 and do a certainamount of work W13, and let it deliver heat Q3 to the temperature T3 (Fig. 44-8).Let another engine run backwards between T2 and T3. Suppose that we let thesecond engine be of such a size that it will absorb the same heat Q3, and deliverthe heat Q2. We will have to put a certain amount of work, W32, into it—negativebecause the engine is running backwards. When the ﬁrst machine goes through acycle, it absorbs heat Q1 and delivers Q3 at the temperature T3; then the secondmachine takes the same heat Q3 out of the reservoir at the temperature T3 anddelivers it into the reservoir at temperature T2. Therefore the net result of thetwo machines in tandem is to take the heat Q1 from T1, and deliver Q2 at T2.The two machines are thus equivalent to a third one, which absorbs Q1 at T1,does work W12, and delivers heat Q2 at T2, because W12 = W13 − W32, as onecan immediately show from the ﬁrst law, as follows:

W13 − W32 = (Q1 − Q3) − (Q2 − Q3) = Q1 − Q2 = W12.

(44.8)We can now obtain the laws which relate the eﬃciencies of the engines, becausethere clearly must be some kind of relationship between the eﬃciencies of enginesrunning between the temperatures T1 and T3, and between T2 and T3, andbetween T1 and T2.

44-15

We can make the argument very clear in the following way: We have justseen that we can always relate the heat absorbed at T1 to the heat deliveredat T2 by ﬁnding the heat delivered at some other temperature T3. Thereforewe can get all the engines’ properties if we introduce a standard temperature,analyzing everything with that standard temperature. In other words, if weknew the eﬃciency of an engine running between a certain temperature T and acertain arbitrary standard temperature, then we could work out the eﬃciencyfor any other diﬀerence in temperature. Because we assume we are using onlyreversible engines, we can work from the initial temperature down to the standardtemperature and back up to the ﬁnal temperature again. We shall deﬁne thestandard temperature arbitrarily as one degree. We shall also adopt a specialsymbol for the heat which is delivered at this standard temperature: we shallcall it QS.In other words, when a reversible engine absorbs the heat Q attemperature T, it will deliver, at the unit temperature, a heat QS. If one engine,absorbing heat Q1 at T1, delivers the heat QS at one degree, and if an engineabsorbing heat Q2 at temperature T2 will also deliver the same heat QS at onedegree, then it follows that an engine which absorbs heat Q1 at the temperature T1will deliver heat Q2 if it runs between T1 and T2, as we have already proved byconsidering engines running between three temperatures. So all we really haveto do is to ﬁnd how much heat Q1 we need to put in at the temperature T1 inorder to deliver a certain amount of heat QS at the unit temperature. If wediscover that, we have everything. The heat Q, of course, is a function of thetemperature T. It is easy to see that the heat must increase as the temperatureincreases, for we know that it takes work to run an engine backwards and deliverheat at a higher temperature. It is also easy to see that the heat Q1 must beproportional to QS. So the great law is something like this: for a given amountof heat QS delivered at one degree from an engine running at temperature Tdegrees, the heat Q absorbed must be that amount QS times some increasingfunction of the temperature:

Q = QSf(T).

44-5 The thermodynamic temperatureAt this stage we are not going to try to ﬁnd the formula for the above increasingfunction of the temperature in terms of our familiar mercury temperature scale,but instead we shall deﬁne temperature by a new scale. At one time「thetemperature」was deﬁned arbitrarily by dividing the expansion of water into

44-16

even degrees of a certain size. But when one then measures temperature with amercury thermometer, one ﬁnds that the degrees are no longer even. But nowwe can make a deﬁnition of temperature which is independent of any particularsubstance. We can use that function f(T), which does not depend on what devicewe use, because the eﬃciency of these reversible engines is independent of theirworking substances. Since the function we found is rising with temperature,we will deﬁne the function itself as the temperature, measured in units of thestandard one-degree temperature, as follows:Q = ST,

(44.10)

where

QS = S · 1◦.

(44.11)This means that we can tell how hot an object is by ﬁnding out how much heatis absorbed by a reversible engine working between the temperature of the objectand the unit temperature (Fig. 44-9). If seven times more heat is taken outof a boiler than is delivered at a one-degree condenser, the temperature of theboiler will be called seven degrees, and so forth. So, by measuring how muchheat is absorbed at diﬀerent temperatures, we determine the temperature. Thetemperature deﬁned in this way is called the absolute thermodynamic temperature,and it is independent of the substance. We shall use this deﬁnition exclusivelyfrom now on.*

Fig. 44-9. Absolute thermodynamic temperature.

* We have previously deﬁned our scale of temperature in a diﬀerent way, namely by statingthat the mean kinetic energy of a molecule in a perfect gas is proportional to the temperature,or that the perfect gas law says pV is proportional to T . Is this new deﬁnition equivalent? Yes,since the ﬁnal result (44.7) derived from the gas law is the same as that derived here. We shalldiscuss this point again in the next chapter.

44-17

Now we see that when we have two engines, one working between T1 and onedegree, the other working between T2 and one degree, delivering the same heatat unit temperature, then the heats absorbed must be related by

Q1T1

= S = Q2T2

.

(44.12)

But that means that if we have a single engine running between T1 and T2, thenthe result of the whole analysis, the grand ﬁnale, is that Q1 is to T1 as Q2 isto T2, if the engine absorbs energy Q1 at temperature T1 and delivers heat Q2 attemperature T2. Whenever the engine is reversible, this relationship between theheats must follow. That is all there is to it: that is the center of the universe ofthermodynamics.

If this is all there is to thermodynamics, why is it considered such a diﬃcultsubject? In doing a problem involving a given mass of some substance, thecondition of the substance at any moment can be described by telling what itstemperature is and what its volume is. If we know the temperature and volume ofa substance, and that the pressure is some function of the temperature and volume,then we know the internal energy. One could say,「I do not want to do it that way.Tell me the temperature and the pressure, and I will tell you the volume. I canthink of the volume as a function of temperature and pressure, and the internalenergy as a function of temperature and pressure, and so on.」That is why thermo-dynamics is hard, because everyone uses a diﬀerent approach. If we could only sitdown once and decide on our variables, and stick to them, it would be fairly easy.Now we start to make deductions. Just as F = ma is the center of theuniverse in mechanics, and it goes on and on and on after that, in the same waythe principle just found is all there is to thermodynamics. But can one makeconclusions out of it?

We begin. To obtain our ﬁrst conclusion, we shall combine both laws, thelaw of conservation of energy and this law which relates the heats Q2 and Q1,and we can easily obtain the eﬃciency of a reversible engine. From the ﬁrst law,we have W = Q1 − Q2. According to our new principle,

so the work becomes

(cid:18)

W = Q1

Q2 = T2T1

1 − T2T1

(cid:19)

Q1,

= Q1

T1 − T2

(44.13)

44-18

which tells us the eﬃciency of the engine—how much work we get out of somuch heat. The eﬃciency of an engine is proportional to the diﬀerence in thetemperatures between which the engine runs, divided by the higher temperature:

Eﬃciency = WQ1

= T1 − T2

T1

.

(44.14)

The eﬃciency cannot be greater than unity and the absolute temperature cannotbe less than zero, absolute zero. So, since T2 must be positive, the eﬃciency isalways less than unity. That is our ﬁrst conclusion.

44-6 EntropyEquation (44.7) or (44.12) can be interpreted in a special way. Working alwayswith reversible engines, a heat Q1 at temperature T1 is「equivalent」to Q2 at T2 ifQ1/T1 = Q2/T2, in the sense that as one is absorbed the other is delivered. Thissuggests that if we call Q/T something, we can say: in a reversible process asmuch Q/T is absorbed as is liberated; there is no gain or loss of Q/T. This Q/Tis called entropy, and we say「there is no net change in entropy in a reversiblecycle.」If T is 1◦, then the entropy is QS/1◦ or, as we symbolized it, QS/1◦ = S.Actually, S is the letter usually used for entropy, and it is numerically equal tothe heat (which we have called QS) delivered to a 1◦-reservoir (entropy is notitself a heat, it is heat divided by a temperature, hence it is measured in joulesper degree).Now it is interesting that besides the pressure, which is a function of thetemperature and the volume, and the internal energy, which is a function oftemperature and volume, we have found another quantity which is a functionof the condition, i.e., the entropy of the substance. Let us try to explain howwe compute it, and what we mean when we call it a「function of the condition.」Consider the system in two diﬀerent conditions, much as we had in the experimentwhere we did the adiabatic and isothermal expansions. (Incidentally, there isno need that a heat engine have only two reservoirs, it could have three or fourdiﬀerent temperatures at which it takes in and delivers heats, and so on.) Wecan move around on a pV diagram all over the place, and go from one conditionto another. In other words, we could say the gas is in a certain condition a,and then it goes over to some other condition, b, and we will require that thistransition, made from a to b, be reversible. Now suppose that all along the pathfrom a to b we have little reservoirs at diﬀerent temperatures, so that the heat dQ

44-19

removed from the substance at each little step is delivered to each reservoir atthe temperature corresponding to that point on the path. Then let us connectall these reservoirs, by reversible heat engines, to a single reservoir at the unittemperature. When we are ﬁnished carrying the substance from a to b, we shallbring all the reservoirs back to their original condition. Any heat dQ that hasbeen absorbed from the substance at temperature T has now been converted bya reversible machine, and a certain amount of entropy dS has been delivered atthe unit temperature as follows:

dS = dQ/T.

(44.15)

Let us compute the total amount of entropy which has been delivered. Theentropy diﬀerence, or the entropy needed to go from a to b by this particularreversible transformation, is the total entropy, the total of the entropy taken outof the little reservoirs, and delivered at the unit temperature:

Z b

a

Sb − Sa =

dQT

.

(44.16)

The question is, does the entropy diﬀerence depend upon the path taken? Thereis more than one way to go from a to b. Remember that in the Carnot cyclewe could go from a to c in Fig. 44-6 by ﬁrst expanding isothermally and thenadiabatically; or we could ﬁrst expand adiabatically and then isothermally. Sothe question is whether the entropy change which occurs when we go from a to bin Fig. 44-10 is the same on one route as it is on another. It must be the same,

Fig. 44-10. Change in entropy during a reversible transformation.

44-20

because if we went all the way around the cycle, going forward on one path andbackward on another, we would have a reversible engine, and there would be noloss of heat to the reservoir at unit temperature. In a totally reversible cycle, noheat must be taken from the reservoir at the unit temperature, so the entropyneeded to go from a to b is the same over one path as it is over another. It isindependent of path, and depends only on the endpoints. We can, therefore, saythat there is a certain function, which we call the entropy of the substance, thatdepends only on the condition, i.e., only on the volume and temperature.

We can ﬁnd a function S(V, T) which has the property that if we computethe change in entropy, as the substance is moved along any reversible path, interms of the heat rejected at unit temperature, then

∆S =

,

(44.17)

where dQ is the heat removed from the substance at temperature T. This totalentropy change is the diﬀerence between the entropy calculated at the initial andﬁnal points:

∆S = S(Vb, Tb) − S(Va, Ta) =

.

(44.18)

This expression does not completely deﬁne the entropy, but rather only thediﬀerence of entropy between two diﬀerent conditions. Only if we can evaluatethe entropy for one special condition can we really deﬁne S absolutely.For a long time it was believed that absolute entropy meant nothing—thatonly diﬀerences could be deﬁned—but ﬁnally Nernst proposed what he called the

dQT

Fig. 44-11. Change in entropy in a completely reversible cycle.

44-21

heat theorem, which is also called the third law of thermodynamics. It is verysimple. We will say what it is, but we will not explain why it is true. Nernst’spostulate states simply that the entropy of any object at absolute zero is zero.We know of one case of T and V , namely T = 0, where S is zero; and so we canget the entropy at any other point.To give an illustration of these ideas, let us calculate the entropy of a perfect

gas. In an isothermal (and therefore reversible) expansion,R dQ/T is Q/T, since

T is constant. Therefore (from 44.4) the change in entropy is

S(Va, T) − S(Vb, T) = N k ln VaVb

,

so S(V, T) = N k ln V plus some function of T only. How does S depend on T?We know that for a reversible adiabatic expansion, no heat is exchanged. Thusthe entropy does not change even though V changes, provided that T changesalso, such that T V γ−1 = constant. Can you see that this implies that

(cid:20)ln V + 1

(cid:21)

S(V, T) = N k

γ − 1 ln T

+ a,

where a is some constant independent of both V and T? [a is called the chemicalconstant. It depends on the gas in question, and may be determined experimen-tally from the Nernst theorem by measuring the heat liberated in cooling andcondensing the gas until it is brought to a solid (or for helium, a liquid) at 0◦, by

integratingR dQ/T. It can also be determined theoretically by means of Planck’s

constant and quantum mechanics, but we shall not study it in this course.]

Now we shall remark on some of the properties of the entropy of things. Weﬁrst remember that if we go along a reversible cycle from a to b, then the entropyof the substance will change by Sb−Sa. And we remember that as we go along thepath, the entropy—the heat delivered at unit temperature—increases accordingto the rule dS = dQ/T, where dQ is the heat we remove from the substancewhen its temperature is T.We already know that if we have a reversible cycle, the total entropy ofeverything is not changed, because the heat Q1 absorbed at T1 and the heat Q2delivered at T2 correspond to equal and opposite changes in entropy, so that thenet change in the entropy is zero. So for a reversible cycle there is no changein the entropy of anything, including the reservoirs. This rule may look like theconservation of energy again, but it is not; it applies only to reversible cycles. Ifwe include irreversible cycles there is no law of conservation of entropy.

44-22

We shall give two examples. First, suppose that we do irreversible work onan object by friction, generating a heat Q on some object at temperature T. Theentropy is increased by Q/T. The heat Q is equal to the work, and thus whenwe do a certain amount of work by friction against an object whose temperatureis T, the entropy of the whole world increases by W/T.Another example of irreversibility is this: If we put together two objects thatare at diﬀerent temperatures, say T1 and T2, a certain amount of heat will ﬂowfrom one to the other by itself. Suppose, for instance, we put a hot stone in coldwater. Then when a certain heat ∆Q is transferred from T1 to T2, how muchdoes the entropy of the hot stone change? It decreases by ∆Q/T1. How muchdoes the water entropy change? It increases by ∆Q/T2. The heat will, of course,ﬂow only from the higher temperature T1 to the lower temperature T2, so that∆Q is positive if T1 is greater than T2. So the change in entropy of the wholeworld is positive, and it is the diﬀerence of the two fractions:

∆S = ∆Q

T2

− ∆Q

T1

.

(44.19)

So the following proposition is true: in any process that is irreversible, theentropy of the whole world is increased. Only in reversible processes does theentropy remain constant. Since no process is absolutely reversible, there is alwaysat least a small gain in the entropy; a reversible process is an idealization inwhich we have made the gain of entropy minimal.

Unfortunately, we are not going to enter into the ﬁeld of thermodynamics veryfar. Our purpose is only to illustrate the principal ideas involved and the reasonswhy it is possible to make such arguments, but we will not use thermodynamicsvery much in this course. Thermodynamics is used very often by engineers and,particularly, by chemists. So we must learn our thermodynamics in practice inchemistry or engineering. Because it is not worthwhile duplicating everything,we shall just give some discussion of the origin of the theory, rather than muchdetail for special applications.

The two laws of thermodynamics are often stated this way:

the energy of the universe is always constant.

First law:Second law: the entropy of the universe is always increasing.

That is not a very good statement of the second law; it does not say, for example,that in a reversible cycle the entropy stays the same, and it does not say exactly

44-23

what the entropy is. It is just a clever way of remembering the two laws, but itdoes not really tell us exactly where we stand. We have summarized the lawsdiscussed in this chapter in Table 44-1. In the next chapter we shall apply theselaws to discover the relationship between the heat generated in the expansion ofa rubber band, and the extra tension when it is heated.

Table 44-1

Summary of the laws of thermodynamics

Heat put into a system + Work done on a system = Increase in internal energy of thesystem:

dQ + dW = dU.

First law:

Second law:

A process whose only net result is to take heat from a reservoir and convert it towork is impossible.No heat engine taking heat Q1 from T1 and delivering heat Q2 at T2 can do morework than a reversible engine, for which

W = Q1 − Q2 = Q1

The entropy of a system is deﬁned this way:

(cid:18) T1 − T2

(cid:19)

.

T1

(a) If heat ∆Q is added reversibly to a system at temperature T , the increase in

entropy of the system is ∆S = ∆Q/T .

(b) At T = 0, S = 0 (third law).

In a reversible change, the total entropy of all parts of the system (including reservoirs)does not change.In irreversible change, the total entropy of the system always increases.
