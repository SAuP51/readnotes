Conservation of Energy

4-1 What is energy?In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the diﬀerent aspects ofphysics, having ﬁnished our description of things in general. To illustrate theideas and the kind of reasoning that might be used in theoretical physics, we shallnow examine one of the most basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy.There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena thatare known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far aswe know. The law is called the conservation of energy. It states that there isa certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifoldchanges which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is amathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which doesnot change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, oranything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number andwhen we ﬁnish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the numberagain, it is the same. (Something like the bishop on a red square, and after anumber of moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law ofthis nature.) Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it byan analogy.

Imagine a child, perhaps「Dennis the Menace,」who has blocks which areabsolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into pieces. Each is the sameas the other. Let us suppose that he has 28 blocks. His mother puts him withhis 28 blocks into a room at the beginning of the day. At the end of the day,being curious, she counts the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenallaw—no matter what he does with the blocks, there are always 28 remaining!This continues for a number of days, until one day there are only 27 blocks,but a little investigating shows that there is one under the rug—she must lookeverywhere to be sure that the number of blocks has not changed. One day,

4-1

however, the number appears to change—there are only 26 blocks. Carefulinvestigation indicates that the window was open, and upon looking outside, theother two blocks are found. Another day, careful count indicates that there are30 blocks! This causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Brucecame to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at Dennis’ house.After she has disposed of the extra blocks, she closes the window, does not letBruce in, and then everything is going along all right, until one time she countsand ﬁnds only 25 blocks. However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, andthe mother goes to open the toy box, but the boy says「No, do not open my toybox,」and screams. Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremelycurious, and somewhat ingenious, she invents a scheme! She knows that a blockweighs three ounces, so she weighs the box at a time when she sees 28 blocks,and it weighs 16 ounces. The next time she wishes to check, she weighs the boxagain, subtracts sixteen ounces and divides by three. She discovers the following:

+ (weight of box) − 16 ounces

3 ounces

= constant.

(4.1)

(cid:18) number of

blocks seen

(cid:19)

There then appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates thatthe dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is throwing blocksinto the water, and she cannot see them because it is so dirty, but she can ﬁndout how many blocks are in the water by adding another term to her formula.Since the original height of the water was 6 inches and each block raises the watera quarter of an inch, this new formula would be:

(cid:18) number of

blocks seen

(cid:19)

+ (weight of box) − 16 ounces+ (height of water) − 6 inches

3 ounces

1/4 inch

= constant.

(4.2)

In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she ﬁnds a whole seriesof terms representing ways of calculating how many blocks are in places whereshe is not allowed to look. As a result, she ﬁnds a complex formula, a quantitywhich has to be computed, which always stays the same in her situation.

What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? The most remark-able aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is that there are no blocks.Take away the ﬁrst terms in (4.1) and (4.2) and we ﬁnd ourselves calculating

4-2

more or less abstract things. The analogy has the following points. First, whenwe are calculating the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goesaway, or sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of energy,we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any out. Second, theenergy has a large number of diﬀerent forms, and there is a formula for eachone. These are: gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy,electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy.If we total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not changeexcept for energy going in and out.

It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of whatenergy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a deﬁniteamount. It is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating somenumerical quantity, and when we add it all together it gives「28」—always thesame number. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanismor the reasons for the various formulas.

4-2 Gravitational potential energyConservation of energy can be understood only if we have the formula forall of its forms. I wish to discuss the formula for gravitational energy near thesurface of the Earth, and I wish to derive this formula in a way which has nothingto do with history but is simply a line of reasoning invented for this particularlecture to give you an illustration of the remarkable fact that a great deal aboutnature can be extracted from a few facts and close reasoning. It is an illustrationof the kind of work theoretical physicists become involved in. It is patterned aftera most excellent argument by Mr. Carnot on the eﬃciency of steam engines.*

Consider weight-lifting machines—machines which have the property thatthey lift one weight by lowering another. Let us also make a hypothesis: thatthere is no such thing as perpetual motion with these weight-lifting machines. (Infact, that there is no perpetual motion at all is a general statement of the law ofconservation of energy.) We must be careful to deﬁne perpetual motion. First,let us do it for weight-lifting machines. If, when we have lifted and lowered a lotof weights and restored the machine to the original condition, we ﬁnd that thenet result is to have lifted a weight, then we have a perpetual motion machinebecause we can use that lifted weight to run something else. That is, provided the* Our point here is not so much the result, (4.3), which in fact you may already know, as

the possibility of arriving at it by theoretical reasoning.

machine which lifted the weight is brought back to its exact original condition,and furthermore that it is completely self-contained—that it has not receivedthe energy to lift that weight from some external source—like Bruce’s blocks.

A very simple weight-lifting machine is shown in Fig. 4-1. This machine liftsweights three units「strong.」We place three units on one balance pan, and oneunit on the other. However, in order to get it actually to work, we must lift alittle weight oﬀ the left pan. On the other hand, we could lift a one-unit weightby lowering the three-unit weight, if we cheat a little by lifting a little weightoﬀ the other pan. Of course, we realize that with any actual lifting machine, wemust add a little extra to get it to run. This we disregard, temporarily. Idealmachines, although they do not exist, do not require anything extra. A machinethat we actually use can be, in a sense, almost reversible: that is, if it will liftthe weight of three by lowering a weight of one, then it will also lift nearly theweight of one the same amount by lowering the weight of three.

We imagine that there are two classes of machines, those that are not reversible,which includes all real machines, and those that are reversible, which of courseare actually not attainable no matter how careful we may be in our designof bearings, levers, etc. We suppose, however, that there is such a thing—areversible machine—which lowers one unit of weight (a pound or any other unit)by one unit of distance, and at the same time lifts a three-unit weight. Call thisreversible machine, Machine A. Suppose this particular reversible machine liftsthe three-unit weight a distance X. Then suppose we have another machine,Machine B, which is not necessarily reversible, which also lowers a unit weight aunit distance, but which lifts three units a distance Y . We can now prove thatY is not higher than X; that is, it is impossible to build a machine that will lifta weight any higher than it will be lifted by a reversible machine. Let us seewhy. Let us suppose that Y were higher than X. We take a one-unit weight andlower it one unit height with Machine B, and that lifts the three-unit weight upa distance Y . Then we could lower the weight from Y to X, obtaining free power,and use the reversible Machine A, running backwards, to lower the three-unit

4-4

weight a distance X and lift the one-unit weight by one unit height. This willput the one-unit weight back where it was before, and leave both machines readyto be used again! We would therefore have perpetual motion if Y were higherthan X, which we assumed was impossible. With those assumptions, we thusdeduce that Y is not higher than X, so that of all machines that can be designed,the reversible machine is the best.We can also see that all reversible machines must lift to exactly the sameheight. Suppose that B were really reversible also. The argument that Y is nothigher than X is, of course, just as good as it was before, but we can also makeour argument the other way around, using the machines in the opposite order, andprove that X is not higher than Y . This, then, is a very remarkable observationbecause it permits us to analyze the height to which diﬀerent machines aregoing to lift something without looking at the interior mechanism. We know atonce that if somebody makes an enormously elaborate series of levers that liftthree units a certain distance by lowering one unit by one unit distance, and wecompare it with a simple lever which does the same thing and is fundamentallyreversible, his machine will lift it no higher, but perhaps less high. If his machineis reversible, we also know exactly how high it will lift. To summarize: everyreversible machine, no matter how it operates, which drops one pound one footand lifts a three-pound weight always lifts it the same distance, X. This is clearlya universal law of great utility. The next question is, of course, what is X?Suppose we have a reversible machine which is going to lift this distance X,three for one. We set up three balls in a rack which does not move, as shownin Fig. 4-2. One ball is held on a stage at a distance one foot above the ground.The machine can lift three balls, lowering one by a distance 1. Now, we havearranged that the platform which holds three balls has a ﬂoor and two shelves,exactly spaced at distance X, and further, that the rack which holds the ballsis spaced at distance X, (a). First we roll the balls horizontally from the rackto the shelves, (b), and we suppose that this takes no energy because we do notchange the height. The reversible machine then operates: it lowers the singleball to the ﬂoor, and it lifts the rack a distance X, (c). Now we have ingeniouslyarranged the rack so that these balls are again even with the platforms. Thus weunload the balls onto the rack, (d); having unloaded the balls, we can restore themachine to its original condition. Now we have three balls on the upper threeshelves and one at the bottom. But the strange thing is that, in a certain wayof speaking, we have not lifted two of them at all because, after all, there wereballs on shelves 2 and 3 before. The resulting eﬀect has been to lift one ball a

4-5

distance 3X. Now, if 3X exceeds one foot, then we can lower the ball to returnthe machine to the initial condition, (f), and we can run the apparatus again.Therefore 3X cannot exceed one foot, for if 3X exceeds one foot we can makeperpetual motion. Likewise, we can prove that one foot cannot exceed 3X, bymaking the whole machine run the opposite way, since it is a reversible machine.Therefore 3X is neither greater nor less than a foot, and we discover then, byargument alone, the law that X = 13 foot. The generalization is clear: one poundfalls a certain distance in operating a reversible machine; then the machine canlift p pounds this distance divided by p. Another way of putting the result isthat three pounds times the height lifted, which in our problem was X, is equalto one pound times the distance lowered, which is one foot in this case. If wetake all the weights and multiply them by the heights at which they are now,above the ﬂoor, let the machine operate, and then multiply all the weights by allthe heights again, there will be no change. (We have to generalize the examplewhere we moved only one weight to the case where when we lower one we liftseveral diﬀerent ones—but that is easy.)

4-6

We call the sum of the weights times the heights gravitational potential energy—the energy which an object has because of its relationship in space, relative tothe earth. The formula for gravitational energy, then, so long as we are not toofar from the earth (the force weakens as we go higher) is

gravitational

potential energyfor one object

 = (weight) × (height).

(4.3)

It is a very beautiful line of reasoning. The only problem is that perhaps it isnot true. (After all, nature does not have to go along with our reasoning.) Forexample, perhaps perpetual motion is, in fact, possible. Some of the assumptionsmay be wrong, or we may have made a mistake in reasoning, so it is alwaysnecessary to check. It turns out experimentally, in fact, to be true.The general name of energy which has to do with location relative to somethingelse is called potential energy.In this particular case, of course, we call itgravitational potential energy. If it is a question of electrical forces against whichwe are working, instead of gravitational forces, if we are「lifting」charges awayfrom other charges with a lot of levers, then the energy content is called electricalpotential energy. The general principle is that the change in the energy is theforce times the distance that the force is pushed, and that this is a change in

(4.4)

We will return to many of these other kinds of energy as we continue the course.The principle of the conservation of energy is very useful for deducing whatwill happen in a number of circumstances. In high school we learned a lot oflaws about pulleys and levers used in diﬀerent ways. We can now see that these「laws」are all the same thing, and that we did not have to memorize 75 rules toﬁgure it out. A simple example is a smooth inclined plane which is, happily, athree-four-ﬁve triangle (Fig. 4-3). We hang a one-pound weight on the inclinedplane with a pulley, and on the other side of the pulley, a weight W. We wantto know how heavy W must be to balance the one pound on the plane. Howcan we ﬁgure that out? If we say it is just balanced, it is reversible and so canmove up and down, and we can consider the following situation. In the initialcircumstance, (a), the one pound weight is at the bottom and weight W is at

4-7

the top. When W has slipped down in a reversible way, we have a one-poundweight at the top and the weight W the slant distance, (b), or ﬁve feet, from theplane in which it was before. We lifted the one-pound weight only three feet andwe lowered W pounds by ﬁve feet. Therefore W = 35 of a pound. Note that wededuced this from the conservation of energy, and not from force components.Cleverness, however, is relative. It can be deduced in a way which is even morebrilliant, discovered by Stevinus and inscribed on his tombstone. Figure 4-4explains that it has to be 35 of a pound, because the chain does not go around.It is evident that the lower part of the chain is balanced by itself, so that thepull of the ﬁve weights on one side must balance the pull of three weights on theother, or whatever the ratio of the legs. You see, by looking at this diagram, that5 of a pound. (If you get an epitaph like that on your gravestone,W must be 3you are doing ﬁne.)Let us now illustrate the energy principle with a more complicated problem,the screw jack shown in Fig. 4-5. A handle 20 inches long is used to turn the

4-8

Fig. 4-5. A screw jack.

screw, which has 10 threads to the inch. We would like to know how much forcewould be needed at the handle to lift one ton (2000 pounds). If we want to liftthe ton one inch, say, then we must turn the handle around ten times. When itgoes around once it goes approximately 126 inches. The handle must thus travel1260 inches, and if we used various pulleys, etc., we would be lifting our one tonwith an unknown smaller weight W applied to the end of the handle. So we ﬁndout that W is about 1.6 pounds. This is a result of the conservation of energy.

Fig. 4-6. Weighted rod supported on one end.

Take now the somewhat more complicated example shown in Fig. 4-6. A rodor bar, 8 feet long, is supported at one end. In the middle of the bar is a weightof 60 pounds, and at a distance of two feet from the support there is a weight of100 pounds. How hard do we have to lift the end of the bar in order to keep itbalanced, disregarding the weight of the bar? Suppose we put a pulley at one endand hang a weight on the pulley. How big would the weight W have to be in orderfor it to balance? We imagine that the weight falls any arbitrary distance—tomake it easy for ourselves suppose it goes down 4 inches—how high would thetwo load weights rise? The center rises 2 inches, and the point a quarter of theway from the ﬁxed end lifts 1 inch. Therefore, the principle that the sum ofthe heights times the weights does not change tells us that the weight W times4 inches down, plus 60 pounds times 2 inches up, plus 100 pounds times 1 inchhas to add up to nothing:

− 4W + (2)(60) + (1)(100) = 0,

W = 55 lb.

(4.5)

4-9

Thus we must have a 55-pound weight to balance the bar. In this way we canwork out the laws of「balance」—the statics of complicated bridge arrangements,and so on. This approach is called the principle of virtual work, because in orderto apply this argument we had to imagine that the structure moves a little—eventhough it is not really moving or even movable. We use the very small imaginedmotion to apply the principle of conservation of energy.

4-3 Kinetic energyTo illustrate another type of energy we consider a pendulum (Fig. 4-7). If wepull the mass aside and release it, it swings back and forth. In its motion, it losesheight in going from either end to the center. Where does the potential energygo? Gravitational energy disappears when it is down at the bottom; nevertheless,it will climb up again. The gravitational energy must have gone into anotherform. Evidently it is by virtue of its motion that it is able to climb up again,so we have the conversion of gravitational energy into some other form when itreaches the bottom.

Fig. 4-7. Pendulum.

We must get a formula for the energy of motion. Now, recalling our argumentsabout reversible machines, we can easily see that in the motion at the bottommust be a quantity of energy which permits it to rise a certain height, and whichhas nothing to do with the machinery by which it comes up or the path by whichit comes up. So we have an equivalence formula something like the one we wrotefor the child’s blocks. We have another form to represent the energy. It is easyto say what it is. The kinetic energy at the bottom equals the weight times theheight that it could go, corresponding to its velocity: K.E. = W H. What weneed is the formula which tells us the height by some rule that has to do with themotion of objects. If we start something out with a certain velocity, say straightup, it will reach a certain height; we do not know what it is yet, but it depends

4-10

on the velocity—there is a formula for that. Then to ﬁnd the formula for kineticenergy for an object moving with velocity V , we must calculate the height thatit could reach, and multiply by the weight. We shall soon ﬁnd that we can writeit this way:

K.E. = W V 2/2g.

(4.6)Of course, the fact that motion has energy has nothing to do with the fact thatwe are in a gravitational ﬁeld. It makes no diﬀerence where the motion camefrom. This is a general formula for various velocities. Both (4.3) and (4.6) areapproximate formulas, the ﬁrst because it is incorrect when the heights are great,i.e., when the heights are so high that gravity is weakening; the second, becauseof the relativistic correction at high speeds. However, when we do ﬁnally get theexact formula for the energy, then the law of conservation of energy is correct.

4-4 Other forms of energyWe can continue in this way to illustrate the existence of energy in other forms.First, consider elastic energy. If we pull down on a spring, we must do some work,for when we have it down, we can lift weights with it. Therefore in its stretchedcondition it has a possibility of doing some work. If we were to evaluate the sumsof weights times heights, it would not check out—we must add something elseto account for the fact that the spring is under tension. Elastic energy is theformula for a spring when it is stretched. How much energy is it? If we let go, theelastic energy, as the spring passes through the equilibrium point, is convertedto kinetic energy and it goes back and forth between compressing or stretchingthe spring and kinetic energy of motion. (There is also some gravitational energygoing in and out, but we can do this experiment「sideways」if we like.) It keepsgoing until the losses—Aha! We have cheated all the way through by puttingon little weights to move things or saying that the machines are reversible, orthat they go on forever, but we can see that things do stop, eventually. Where isthe energy when the spring has ﬁnished moving up and down? This brings inanother form of energy: heat energy.

Inside a spring or a lever there are crystals which are made up of lots of atoms,and with great care and delicacy in the arrangement of the parts one can try toadjust things so that as something rolls on something else, none of the atoms doany jiggling at all. But one must be very careful. Ordinarily when things roll,there is bumping and jiggling because of the irregularities of the material, and

4-11

the atoms start to wiggle inside. So we lose track of that energy; we ﬁnd theatoms are wiggling inside in a random and confused manner after the motionslows down. There is still kinetic energy, all right, but it is not associated withvisible motion. What a dream! How do we know there is still kinetic energy? Itturns out that with thermometers you can ﬁnd out that, in fact, the spring orthe lever is warmer, and that there is really an increase of kinetic energy by adeﬁnite amount. We call this form of energy heat energy, but we know that itis not really a new form, it is just kinetic energy—internal motion. (One of thediﬃculties with all these experiments with matter that we do on a large scaleis that we cannot really demonstrate the conservation of energy and we cannotreally make our reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump ofstuﬀ, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a certain amountof random motion goes into the atomic system. We cannot see it, but we canmeasure it with thermometers, etc.)

There are many other forms of energy, and of course we cannot describethem in any more detail just now. There is electrical energy, which has todo with pushing and pulling by electric charges. There is radiant energy, theenergy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can berepresented as wigglings in the electromagnetic ﬁeld. There is chemical energy,the energy which is released in chemical reactions. Actually, elastic energy is,to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energyof the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy. Ourmodern understanding is the following: chemical energy has two parts, kineticenergy of the electrons inside the atoms, so part of it is kinetic, and electricalenergy of interaction of the electrons and the protons—the rest of it, therefore,is electrical. Next we come to nuclear energy, the energy which is involved withthe arrangement of particles inside the nucleus, and we have formulas for that,but we do not have the fundamental laws. We know that it is not electrical, notgravitational, and not purely chemical, but we do not know what it is. It seemsto be an additional form of energy. Finally, associated with the relativity theory,there is a modiﬁcation of the laws of kinetic energy, or whatever you wish to callit, so that kinetic energy is combined with another thing called mass energy. Anobject has energy from its sheer existence. If I have a positron and an electron,standing still doing nothing—never mind gravity, never mind anything—andthey come together and disappear, radiant energy will be liberated, in a deﬁniteamount, and the amount can be calculated. All we need know is the mass of theobject. It does not depend on what it is—we make two things disappear, and

4-12

we get a certain amount of energy. The formula was ﬁrst found by Einstein; itis E = mc2.It is obvious from our discussion that the law of conservation of energy isenormously useful in making analyses, as we have illustrated in a few exampleswithout knowing all the formulas. If we had all the formulas for all kinds ofenergy, we could analyze how many processes should work without having to gointo the details. Therefore conservation laws are very interesting. The questionnaturally arises as to what other conservation laws there are in physics. Thereare two other conservation laws which are analogous to the conservation of energy.One is called the conservation of linear momentum. The other is called theconservation of angular momentum. We will ﬁnd out more about these later.In the last analysis, we do not understand the conservation laws deeply. We donot understand the conservation of energy. We do not understand energy as acertain number of little blobs. You may have heard that photons come out inblobs and that the energy of a photon is Planck’s constant times the frequency.That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no lawthat says that energy has to be a certain deﬁnite amount. Unlike Dennis’ blocks,there can be any amount of energy, at least as presently understood. So we donot understand this energy as counting something at the moment, but just as amathematical quantity, which is an abstract and rather peculiar circumstance.In quantum mechanics it turns out that the conservation of energy is very closelyrelated to another important property of the world, things do not depend onthe absolute time. We can set up an experiment at a given moment and try itout, and then do the same experiment at a later moment, and it will behave inexactly the same way. Whether this is strictly true or not, we do not know. Ifwe assume that it is true, and add the principles of quantum mechanics, then wecan deduce the principle of the conservation of energy. It is a rather subtle andinteresting thing, and it is not easy to explain. The other conservation laws arealso linked together. The conservation of momentum is associated in quantummechanics with the proposition that it makes no diﬀerence where you do theexperiment, the results will always be the same. As independence in space hasto do with the conservation of momentum, independence of time has to do withthe conservation of energy, and ﬁnally, if we turn our apparatus, this too makesno diﬀerence, and so the invariance of the world to angular orientation is relatedto the conservation of angular momentum. Besides these, there are three otherconservation laws, that are exact so far as we can tell today, which are muchsimpler to understand because they are in the nature of counting blocks.

4-13

The ﬁrst of the three is the conservation of charge, and that merely meansthat you count how many positive, minus how many negative electrical chargesyou have, and the number is never changed. You may get rid of a positive with anegative, but you do not create any net excess of positives over negatives. Twoother laws are analogous to this one—one is called the conservation of baryons.There are a number of strange particles, a neutron and a proton are examples,which are called baryons. In any reaction whatever in nature, if we count howmany baryons are coming into a process, the number of baryons* which comeout will be exactly the same. There is another law, the conservation of leptons.We can say that the group of particles called leptons are: electron, mu meson,and neutrino. There is an antielectron which is a positron, that is, a −1 lepton.Counting the total number of leptons in a reaction reveals that the number inand out never changes, at least so far as we know at present.

These are the six conservation laws, three of them subtle, involving space and

time, and three of them simple, in the sense of counting something.

With regard to the conservation of energy, we should note that availableenergy is another matter—there is a lot of jiggling around in the atoms of thewater of the sea, because the sea has a certain temperature, but it is impossibleto get them herded into a deﬁnite motion without taking energy from somewhereelse. That is, although we know for a fact that energy is conserved, the energyavailable for human utility is not conserved so easily. The laws which govern howmuch energy is available are called the laws of thermodynamics and involve aconcept called entropy for irreversible thermodynamic processes.Finally, we remark on the question of where we can get our supplies of energytoday. Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain, coal, uranium, and hydrogen.The sun makes the rain, and the coal also, so that all these are from the sun.Although energy is conserved, nature does not seem to be interested in it; sheliberates a lot of energy from the sun, but only one part in two billion falls on theearth. Nature has conservation of energy, but does not really care; she spends alot of it in all directions. We have already obtained energy from uranium; we canalso get energy from hydrogen, but at present only in an explosive and dangerouscondition. If it can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions, it turns out thatthe energy that can be obtained from 10 quarts of water per second is equal toall of the electrical power generated in the United States. With 150 gallons ofrunning water a minute, you have enough fuel to supply all the energy which is

used in the United States today! Therefore it is up to the physicist to ﬁgure outhow to liberate us from the need for having energy. It can be done.
