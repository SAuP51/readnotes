Motion

8-1 Description of motionIn order to ﬁnd the laws governing the various changes that take place inbodies as time goes on, we must be able to describe the changes and have someway to record them. The simplest change to observe in a body is the apparentchange in its position with time, which we call motion. Let us consider some solidobject with a permanent mark, which we shall call a point, that we can observe.We shall discuss the motion of the little marker, which might be the radiator capof an automobile or the center of a falling ball, and shall try to describe the factthat it moves and how it moves.

These examples may sound trivial, but many subtleties enter into the descrip-tion of change. Some changes are more diﬃcult to describe than the motion of apoint on a solid object, for example the speed of drift of a cloud that is driftingvery slowly, but rapidly forming or evaporating, or the change of a woman’s mind.We do not know a simple way to analyze a change of mind, but since the cloudcan be represented or described by many molecules, perhaps we can describe themotion of the cloud in principle by describing the motion of all its individualmolecules. Likewise, perhaps even the changes in the mind may have a parallelin changes of the atoms inside the brain, but we have no such knowledge yet.

At any rate, that is why we begin with the motion of points; perhaps weshould think of them as atom, but it is probably better to be more rough inthe beginning and simply to think of some kind of small objects—small, thatis, compared with the distance moved. For instance, in describing the motionof a car that is going a hundred miles, we do not have to distinguish betweenthe front and the back of the car. To be sure, there are slight diﬀerences, butfor rough purposes we say「the car,」and likewise it does not matter that ourpoints are not absolute points; for our present purposes it is not necessary to beextremely precise. Also, while we take a ﬁrst look at this subject we are going

to forget about the three dimensions of the world. We shall just concentrateon moving in one direction, as in a car on one road. We shall return to threedimensions after we see how to describe motion in one dimension. Now, you maysay,「This is all some kind of trivia,」and indeed it is. How can we describe such aone-dimensional motion—let us say, of a car? Nothing could be simpler. Amongmany possible ways, one would be the following. To determine the position ofthe car at diﬀerent times, we measure its distance from the starting point andrecord all the observations. In Table 8-1, s represents the distance of the car, infeet, from the starting point, and t represents the time in minutes. The ﬁrst linein the table represents zero distance and zero time—the car has not started yet.After one minute it has started and has gone 1200 feet. Then in two minutes, itgoes farther—notice that it picked up more distance in the second minute—ithas accelerated; but something happened between 3 and 4 and even more soat 5—it stopped at a light perhaps? Then it speeds up again and goes 13,000 feetby the end of 6 minutes, 18,000 feet at the end of 7 minutes, and 23,500 feet in8 minutes; at 9 minutes it has advanced to only 24,000 feet, because in the lastminute it was stopped by a cop.

That is one way to describe the motion. Another way is by means of agraph. If we plot the time horizontally and the distance vertically, we obtain acurve something like that shown in Fig. 8-1. As the time increases, the distanceincreases, at ﬁrst very slowly and then more rapidly, and very slowly again for alittle while at 4 minutes; then it increases again for a few minutes and ﬁnally,at 9 minutes, appears to have stopped increasing. These observations can be

made from the graph, without a table. Obviously, for a complete descriptionone would have to know where the car is at the half-minute marks, too, but wesuppose that the graph means something, that the car has some position at allthe intermediate times.

The motion of a car is complicated. For another example we take somethingthat moves in a simpler manner, following more simple laws: a falling ball.Table 8-2 gives the time in seconds and the distance in feet for a falling body.At zero seconds the ball starts out at zero feet, and at the end of 1 second ithas fallen 16 feet. At the end of 2 seconds, it has fallen 64 feet, at the end of3 seconds, 144 feet, and so on; if the tabulated numbers are plotted, we get thenice parabolic curve shown in Fig. 8-2. The formula for this curve can be writtenas

(8.1)This formula enables us to calculate the distances at any time. You might saythere ought to be a formula for the ﬁrst graph too. Actually, one may write sucha formula abstractly, as

s = 16t2.

s = f(t),

(8.2)meaning that s is some quantity depending on t or, in mathematical phraseology,s is a function of t. Since we do not know what the function is, there is no waywe can write it in deﬁnite algebraic form.

We have now seen two examples of motion, adequately described with verysimple ideas, no subtleties. However, there are subtleties—several of them. In

8-3

the ﬁrst place, what do we mean by time and space? It turns out that these deepphilosophical questions have to be analyzed very carefully in physics, and thisis not so easy to do. The theory of relativity shows that our ideas of space andtime are not as simple as one might think at ﬁrst sight. However, for our presentpurposes, for the accuracy that we need at ﬁrst, we need not be very carefulabout deﬁning things precisely. Perhaps you say,「That’s a terrible thing—Ilearned that in science we have to deﬁne everything precisely.」We cannot deﬁneanything precisely! If we attempt to, we get into that paralysis of thought thatcomes to philosophers, who sit opposite each other, one saying to the other,「Youdon’t know what you are talking about!」The second one says,「What do youmean by know? What do you mean by talking? What do you mean by you?,」and so on. In order to be able to talk constructively, we just have to agree thatwe are talking about roughly the same thing. You know as much about time aswe need for the present, but remember that there are some subtleties that haveto be discussed; we shall discuss them later.

Another subtlety involved, and already mentioned, is that it should be possibleto imagine that the moving point we are observing is always located somewhere.(Of course when we are looking at it, there it is, but maybe when we look away itisn’t there.) It turns out that in the motion of atoms, that idea also is false—wecannot ﬁnd a marker on an atom and watch it move. That subtlety we shallhave to get around in quantum mechanics. But we are ﬁrst going to learn whatthe problems are before introducing the complications, and then we shall be in abetter position to make corrections, in the light of the more recent knowledgeof the subject. We shall, therefore, take a simple point of view about time andspace. We know what these concepts are in a rough way, and those who havedriven a car know what speed means.

8-2 SpeedEven though we know roughly what「speed」means, there are still somerather deep subtleties; consider that the learned Greeks were never able toadequately describe problems involving velocity. The subtlety comes when we tryto comprehend exactly what is meant by「speed.」The Greeks got very confusedabout this, and a new branch of mathematics had to be discovered beyond thegeometry and algebra of the Greeks, Arabs, and Babylonians. As an illustrationof the diﬃculty, try to solve this problem by sheer algebra: A balloon is beinginﬂated so that the volume of the balloon is increasing at the rate of 100 cm3

8-4

per second; at what speed is the radius increasing when the volume is 1000 cm3?The Greeks were somewhat confused by such problems, being helped, of course,by some very confusing Greeks. To show that there were diﬃculties in reasoningabout speed at the time, Zeno produced a large number of paradoxes, of whichwe shall mention one to illustrate his point that there are obvious diﬃculties inthinking about motion.「Listen,」he says,「to the following argument: Achillesruns 10 times as fast as a tortoise, nevertheless he can never catch the tortoise.For, suppose that they start in a race where the tortoise is 100 meters aheadof Achilles; then when Achilles has run the 100 meters to the place where thetortoise was, the tortoise has proceeded 10 meters, having run one-tenth as fast.Now, Achilles has to run another 10 meters to catch up with the tortoise, but onarriving at the end of that run, he ﬁnds that the tortoise is still 1 meter aheadof him; running another meter, he ﬁnds the tortoise 10 centimeters ahead, andso on, ad inﬁnitum. Therefore, at any moment the tortoise is always ahead ofAchilles and Achilles can never catch, up with the tortoise.」What is wrong withthat? It is that a ﬁnite amount of time can be divided into an inﬁnite number ofpieces, just as a length of line can be divided into an inﬁnite number of piecesby dividing repeatedly by two. And so, although there are an inﬁnite numberof steps (in the argument) to the point at which Achilles reaches the tortoise,it doesn’t mean that there is an inﬁnite amount of time. We can see from thisexample that there are indeed some subtleties in reasoning about speed.In order to get to the subtleties in a clearer fashion, we remind you of ajoke which you surely must have heard. At the point where the lady in the caris caught by a cop, the cop comes up to her and says,「Lady, you were going60 miles an hour!」She says,「That’s impossible, sir, I was travelling for onlyseven minutes. It is ridiculous—how can I go 60 miles an hour when I wasn’tgoing an hour?」How would you answer her if you were the cop? Of course, ifyou were really the cop, then no subtleties are involved; it is very simple: you say,「Tell that to the judge!」But let us suppose that we do not have that escape andwe make a more honest, intellectual attack on the problem, and try to explain tothis lady what we mean by the idea that she was going 60 miles an hour. Justwhat do we mean? We say,「What we mean, lady, is this: if you kept on goingthe same way as you are going now, in the next hour you would go 60 miles.」Shecould say,「Well, my foot was oﬀ the accelerator and the car was slowing down,so if I kept on going that way it would not go 60 miles.」Or consider the fallingball and suppose we want to know its speed at the time three seconds if the ballkept on going the way it is going. What does that mean—kept on accelerating,

8-5

going faster? No—kept on going with the same velocity. But that is what we aretrying to deﬁne! For if the ball keeps on going the way it is going, it will justkeep on going the way it is going. Thus we need to deﬁne the velocity better.What has to be kept the same? The lady can also argue this way:「If I kept ongoing the way I’m going for one more hour, I would run into that wall at the endof the street!」It is not so easy to say what we mean.

Many physicists think that measurement is the only deﬁnition of anything.Obviously, then, we should use the instrument that measures the speed—thespeedometer—and say,「Look, lady, your speedometer reads 60.」So she says,「My speedometer is broken and didn’t read at all.」Does that mean the car isstanding still? We believe that there is something to measure before we buildthe speedometer. Only then can we say, for example,「The speedometer isn’tworking right,」or「the speedometer is broken.」That would be a meaninglesssentence if the velocity had no meaning independent of the speedometer. So wehave in our minds, obviously, an idea that is independent of the speedometer,and the speedometer is meant only to measure this idea. So let us see if we canget a better deﬁnition of the idea. We say,「Yes, of course, before you went anhour, you would hit that wall, but if you went one second, you would go 88 feet;lady, you were going 88 feet per second, and if you kept on going, the next secondit would be 88 feet, and the wall down there is farther away than that.」She says,「Yes, but there’s no law against going 88 feet per second! There is only a lawagainst going 60 miles an hour.」「But,」we reply,「it’s the same thing.」If it isthe same thing, it should not be necessary to go into this circumlocution about88 feet per second. In fact, the falling ball could not keep going the same wayeven one second because it would be changing speed, and we shall have to deﬁnespeed somehow.

Now we seem to be getting on the right track; it goes something like this: Ifthe lady kept on going for another 1/1000 of an hour, she would go 1/1000 of60 miles. In other words, she does not have to keep on going for the whole hour;the point is that for a moment she is going at that speed. Now what that meansis that if she went just a little bit more in time, the extra distance she goes wouldbe the same as that of a car that goes at a steady speed of 60 miles an hour.Perhaps the idea of the 88 feet per second is right; we see how far she went inthe last second, divide by 88 feet, and if it comes out 1 the speed was 60 milesan hour. In other words, we can ﬁnd the speed in this way: We ask, how fardo we go in a very short time? We divide that distance by the time, and thatgives the speed. But the time should be made as short as possible, the shorter

8-6

the better, because some change could take place during that time. If we takethe time of a falling body as an hour, the idea is ridiculous. If we take it as asecond, the result is pretty good for a car, because there is not much change inspeed, but not for a falling body; so in order to get the speed more and moreaccurately, we should take a smaller and smaller time interval. What we shoulddo is take a millionth of a second, and divide that distance by a millionth of asecond. The result gives the distance per second, which is what we mean by thevelocity, so we can deﬁne it that way. That is a successful answer for the lady, orrather, that is the deﬁnition that we are going to use.

The foregoing deﬁnition involves a new idea, an idea that was not available tothe Greeks in a general form. That idea was to take an inﬁnitesimal distance andthe corresponding inﬁnitesimal time, form the ratio, and watch what happensto that ratio as the time that we use gets smaller and smaller and smaller. Inother words, take a limit of the distance travelled divided by the time required,as the time taken gets smaller and smaller, ad inﬁnitum. This idea was inventedby Newton and by Leibniz, independently, and is the beginning of a new branchof mathematics, called the diﬀerential calculus. Calculus was invented in orderto describe motion, and its ﬁrst application was to the problem of deﬁning whatis meant by going「60 miles an hour.」

Let us try to deﬁne velocity a little better. Suppose that in a short time, ,the car or other body goes a short distance x; then the velocity, v, is deﬁned as

v = x/,

an approximation that becomes better and better as the  is taken smaller andsmaller. If a mathematical expression is desired, we can say that the velocityequals the limit as the  is made to go smaller and smaller in the expression x/,or(8.3)We cannot do the same thing with the lady in the car, because the table isincomplete. We know only where she was at intervals of one minute; we canget a rough idea that she was going 5000 ft/min during the 7th minute, but wedo not know, at exactly the moment 7 minutes, whether she had been speedingup and the speed was 4900 ft/min at the beginning of the 6th minute, and isnow 5100 ft/min, or something else, because we do not have the exact details inbetween. So only if the table were completed with an inﬁnite number of entriescould we really calculate the velocity from such a table. On the other hand,

v = lim→0

x

.

8-7

when we have a complete mathematical formula, as in the case of a falling body(Eq. 8.1), then it is possible to calculate the velocity, because we can calculatethe position at any time whatsoever.

Let us take as an example the problem of determining the velocity of thefalling ball at the particular time 5 seconds. One way to do this is to see fromTable 8-2 what it did in the 5th second; it went 400 − 256 = 144 ft, so it is going144 ft/sec; however, that is wrong, because the speed is changing; on the averageit is 144 ft/sec during this interval, but the ball is speeding up and is really goingfaster than 144 ft/sec. We want to ﬁnd out exactly how fast. The techniqueinvolved in this process is the following: We know where the ball was at 5 sec.At 5.1 sec, the distance that it has gone all together is 16(5.1)2 = 416.16 ft (seeEq. 8.1). At 5 sec it had already fallen 400 ft; in the last tenth of a second itfell 416.16 − 400 = 16.16 ft. Since 16.16 ft in 0.1 sec is the same as 161.6 ft/sec,that is the speed more or less, but it is not exactly correct. Is that the speedat 5, or at 5.1, or halfway between at 5.05 sec, or when is that the speed? Nevermind—the problem was to ﬁnd the speed at 5 seconds, and we do not have exactlythat; we have to do a better job. So, we take one-thousandth of a second morethan 5 sec, or 5.001 sec, and calculate the total fall as

s = 16(5.001)2 = 16(25.010001) = 400.160016 ft.

In the last 0.001 sec the ball fell 0.160016 ft, and if we divide this number by0.001 sec we obtain the speed as 160.016 ft/sec. That is closer, very close, but it isstill not exact. It should now be evident what we must do to ﬁnd the speed exactly.To perform the mathematics we state the problem a little more abstractly: toﬁnd the velocity at a special time, t0, which in the original problem was 5 sec.Now the distance at t0, which we call s0, is 16t20, or 400 ft in this case. In orderto ﬁnd the velocity, we ask,「At the time t0 + (a little bit), or t0 + , where isthe body?」The new position is 16(t0 + )2 = 16t20 + 32t0 + 162. So it is fartheralong than it was before, because before it was only 16t20. This distance we shallcall s0 + (a little bit more), or s0 + x (if x is the extra bit). Now if we subtractthe distance at t0 from the distance at t0 + , we get x, the extra distance gone,as x = 32t0 ·  + 162. Our ﬁrst approximation to the velocity is

v = x

= 32t0 + 16.

(8.4)

The true velocity is the value of this ratio, x/, when  becomes vanishingly small.In other words, after forming the ratio, we take the limit as  gets smaller and

8-8

smaller, that is, approaches 0. The equation reduces to,

v (at time t0) = 32t0.

In our problem, t0 = 5 sec, so the solution is v = 32 × 5 = 160 ft/sec. A few linesabove, where we took  as 0.1 and 0.001 sec successively, the value we got for vwas a little more than this, but now we see that the actual velocity is precisely160 ft/sec.

8-3 Speed as a derivativeThe procedure we have just carried out is performed so often in mathematicsthat for convenience special notations have been assigned to our quantities and x. In this notation, the  used above becomes ∆t and x becomes ∆s. This∆t means「an extra bit of t,」and carries an implication that it can be madesmaller. The preﬁx ∆ is not a multiplier, any more than sin θ means s· i· n· θ—itsimply deﬁnes a time increment, and reminds us of its special character. ∆s hasan analogous meaning for the distance s. Since ∆ is not a factor, it cannot becancelled in the ratio ∆s/∆t to give s/t, any more than the ratio sin θ/ sin 2θcan be reduced to 1/2 by cancellation. In this notation, velocity is equal to thelimit of ∆s/∆t when ∆t gets smaller, or

v = lim∆t→0

∆s∆t

.

(8.5)

This is really the same as our previous expression (8.3) with  and x, but it hasthe advantage of showing that something is changing, and it keeps track of whatis changing.

Incidentally, to a good approximation we have another law, which says thatthe change in distance of a moving point is the velocity times the time interval,or ∆s = v ∆t. This statement is true only if the velocity is not changing duringthat time interval, and this condition is true only in the limit as ∆t goes to 0.Physicists like to write it ds = v dt, because by dt they mean ∆t in circumstancesin which it is very small; with this understanding, the expression is valid to a closeapproximation. If ∆t is too long, the velocity might change during the interval,and the approximation would become less accurate. For a time dt, approachingzero, ds = v dt precisely. In this notation we can write (8.5) as

v = lim∆t→0

∆s∆t

= dsdt

.

8-9

The quantity ds/dt which we found above is called the「derivative of s withrespect to t」(this language helps to keep track of what was changed), and thecomplicated process of ﬁnding it is called ﬁnding a derivative, or diﬀerentiating.The ds’s and dt’s which appear separately are called diﬀerentials. To familiarizeyou with the words, we say we found the derivative of the function 16t2, or thederivative (with respect to t) of 16t2 is 32t. When we get used to the words, theideas are more easily understood. For practice, let us ﬁnd the derivative of a morecomplicated function. We shall consider the formula s = At3 + Bt + C, whichmight describe the motion of a point. The letters A, B, and C represent constantnumbers, as in the familiar general form of a quadratic equation. Starting fromthe formula for the motion, we wish to ﬁnd the velocity at any time. To ﬁnd thevelocity in the more elegant manner, we change t to t + ∆t and note that s isthen changed to s + some ∆s; then we ﬁnd the ∆s in terms of ∆t. That is to say,

s + ∆s = A(t + ∆t)3 + B(t + ∆t) + C

= At3 + Bt + C + 3At2 ∆t + B ∆t + 3At(∆t)2 + A(∆t)3,

but since

we ﬁnd that

s = At3 + Bt + C,

∆s = 3At2 ∆t + B ∆t + 3At(∆t)2 + A(∆t)3.

But we do not want ∆s—we want ∆s divided by ∆t. We divide the precedingequation by ∆t, getting∆s∆t

= 3At2 + B + 3At(∆t) + A(∆t)2.

As ∆t goes toward 0 the limit of ∆s/∆t is ds/dt and is equal to

= 3At2 + B.

dsdt

This is the fundamental process of calculus, diﬀerentiating functions. The processis even more simple than it appears. Observe that when these expansions containany term with a square or a cube or any higher power of ∆t, such terms may bedropped at once, since they will go to 0 when the limit is taken. After a littlepractice the process gets easier because one knows what to leave out. There aremany rules or formulas for diﬀerentiating various types of functions. These canbe memorized, or can be found in tables. A short list is found in Table 8-3.

8-4 Distance as an integralNow we have to discuss the inverse problem. Suppose that instead of a table ofdistances, we have a table of speeds at diﬀerent times, starting from zero. For thefalling ball, such speeds and times are shown in Table 8-4. A similar table couldbe constructed for the velocity of the car, by recording the speedometer readingevery minute or half-minute. If we know how fast the car is going at any time,can we determine how far it goes? This problem is just the inverse of the onesolved above; we are given the velocity and asked to ﬁnd the distance. How canwe ﬁnd the distance if we know the speed? If the speed of the car is not constant,and the lady goes sixty miles an hour for a moment, then slows down, speeds up,

Table 8-4

8-11

and so on, how can we determine how far she has gone? That is easy. We usethe same idea, and express the distance in terms of inﬁnitesimals. Let us say,「Inthe ﬁrst second her speed was such and such, and from the formula ∆s = v ∆twe can calculate how far the car went the ﬁrst second at that speed.」Now in thenext second her speed is nearly the same, but slightly diﬀerent; we can calculatehow far she went in the next second by taking the new speed times the time.We proceed similarly for each second, to the end of the run. We now have anumber of little distances, and the total distance will be the sum of all these littlepieces. That is, the distance will be the sum of the velocities times the times,

or s =P v ∆t, where the Greek letterP (sigma) is used to denote addition. To

be more precise, it is the sum of the velocity at a certain time, let us say thei-th time, multiplied by ∆t.

v(ti) ∆t.

(8.6)

s =X

The rule for the times is that ti+1 = ti + ∆t. However, the distance we obtain bythis method will not be correct, because the velocity changes during the timeinterval ∆t. If we take the times short enough, the sum is precise, so we takethem smaller and smaller until we obtain the desired accuracy. The true s is

s = lim∆t→0

v(ti) ∆t.

(8.7)

The mathematicians have invented a symbol for this limit, analogous to thesymbol for the diﬀerential. The ∆ turns into a d to remind us that the time is assmall as it can be; the velocity is then called v at the time t, and the addition isdistorted and is now unfortunately just called an integral sign. Thus we write

written as a sum with a great「s,」R (from the Latin summa), which has become

s =

v(t) dt.

(8.8)

one operator (d) undoes the other (R ). One can get formulas for integrals by

This process of adding all these terms together is called integration, and it isthe opposite process to diﬀerentiation. The derivative of this integral is v, sotaking the formulas for derivatives and running them backwards, because they arerelated to each other inversely. Thus one can work out his own table of integrals

8-12

by diﬀerentiating all sorts of functions. For every formula with a diﬀerential, weget an integral formula if we turn it around.

Every function can be diﬀerentiated analytically, i.e., the process can becarried out algebraically, and leads to a deﬁnite function. But it is not possiblein a simple manner to write an analytical value for any integral at will. You cancalculate it, for instance, by doing the above sum, and then doing it again with aﬁner interval ∆t and again with a ﬁner interval until you have it nearly right. Ingeneral, given some particular function, it is not possible to ﬁnd, analytically, whatthe integral is. One may always try to ﬁnd a function which, when diﬀerentiated,gives some desired function; but one may not ﬁnd it, and it may not exist, inthe sense of being expressible in terms of functions that have already been givennames.

8-5 AccelerationThe next step in developing the equations of motion is to introduce anotheridea which goes beyond the concept of velocity to that of change of velocity,and we now ask,「How does the velocity change?」In previous chapters we havediscussed cases in which forces produce changes in velocity. You may have heardwith great excitement about some car that can get from rest to 60 miles an hourin ten seconds ﬂat. From such a performance we can see how fast the speedchanges, but only on the average. What we shall now discuss is the next level ofcomplexity, which is how fast the velocity is changing. In other words, by howmany feet per second does the velocity change in a second, that is, how manyfeet per second, per second? We previously derived the formula for the velocityof a falling body as v = 32t, which is charted in Table 8-4, and now we want toﬁnd out how much the velocity changes per second; this quantity is called theacceleration.

Acceleration is deﬁned as the time rate of change of velocity. From thepreceding discussion we know enough already to write the acceleration as thederivative dv/dt, in the same way that the velocity is the derivative of the distance.If we now diﬀerentiate the formula v = 32t we obtain, for a falling body,

a = dvdt

= 32.

(8.9)

[To diﬀerentiate the term 32t we can utilize the result obtained in a previousproblem, where we found that the derivative of Bt is simply B (a constant). So

8-13

by letting B = 32, we have at once that the derivative of 32t is 32.] This meansthat the velocity of a falling body is changing by 32 feet per second, per secondalways. We also see from Table 8-4 that the velocity increases by 32 ft/sec in eachsecond. This is a very simple case, for accelerations are usually not constant. Thereason the acceleration is constant here is that the force on the falling body isconstant, and Newton’s law says that the acceleration is proportional to the force.As a further example, let us ﬁnd the acceleration in the problem we have

already solved for the velocity. Starting with

we obtained, for v = ds/dt,

s = At3 + Bt + C

v = 3At2 + B.

Since acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to the time, weneed to diﬀerentiate the last expression above. Recall the rule that the derivativeof the two terms on the right equals the sum of the derivatives of the individualterms. To diﬀerentiate the ﬁrst of these terms, instead of going through thefundamental process again we note that we have already diﬀerentiated a quadraticterm when we diﬀerentiated 16t2, and the eﬀect was to double the numericalcoeﬃcient and change the t2 to t; let us assume that the same thing will happenthis time, and you can check the result yourself. The derivative of 3At2 willthen be 6At. Next we diﬀerentiate B, a constant term; but by a rule statedpreviously, the derivative of B is zero; hence this term contributes nothing tothe acceleration. The ﬁnal result, therefore, is a = dv/dt = 6At.For reference, we state two very useful formulas, which can be obtained byintegration. If a body starts from rest and moves with a constant acceleration, g,its velocity v at any time t is given by

v = gt.The distance it covers in the same time iss = 1

Various mathematical notations are used in writing derivatives. Since velocityis ds/dt and acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity, we can also write(8.10)

which are common ways of writing a second derivative.

We have another law that the velocity is equal to the integral of the acceleration.This is just the opposite of a = dv/dt; we have already seen that distance isthe integral of the velocity, so distance can be found by twice integrating theacceleration.

In the foregoing discussion the motion was in only one dimension, andspace permits only a brief discussion of motion in three dimensions. Consider aparticle P which moves in three dimensions in any manner whatsoever. At thebeginning of this chapter, we opened our discussion of the one-dimensional caseof a moving car by observing the distance of the car from its starting point atvarious times. We then discussed velocity in terms of changes of these distanceswith time, and acceleration in terms of changes in velocity. We can treat three-dimensional motion analogously. It will be simpler to illustrate the motion on atwo-dimensional diagram, and then extend the ideas to three dimensions. Weestablish a pair of axes at right angles to each other, and determine the positionof the particle at any moment by measuring how far it is from each of the twoaxes. Thus each position is given in terms of an x-distance and a y-distance, andthe motion can be described by constructing a table in which both these distancesare given as functions of time. (Extension of this process to three dimensionsrequires only another axis, at right angles to the ﬁrst two, and measuring a thirddistance, the z-distance. The distances are now measured from coordinate planesinstead of lines.) Having constructed a table with x- and y-distances, how canwe determine the velocity? We ﬁrst ﬁnd the components of velocity in eachdirection. The horizontal part of the velocity, or x-component, is the derivativeof the x-distance with respect to the time, orvx = dx/dt.

Similarly, the vertical part of the velocity, or y-component, is

In the third dimension,

vy = dy/dt.

vz = dz /dt.

(8.13)

Now, given the components of velocity, how can we ﬁnd the velocity alongthe actual path of motion? In the two-dimensional case, consider two successivepositions of the particle, separated by a short distance ∆s and a short time

interval t2 − t1 = ∆t. In the time ∆t the particle moves horizontally a dis-tance ∆x ≈ vx ∆t, and vertically a distance ∆y ≈ vy ∆t. (The symbol「≈」isread「is approximately.」) The actual distance moved is approximately

(8.14)as shown in Fig. 8-3. The approximate velocity during this interval can beobtained by dividing by ∆t and by letting ∆t go to 0, as at the beginning of thechapter. We then get the velocity as

∆s ≈p(∆x)2 + (∆y)2,=p(dx/dt)2 + (dy/dt)2 =q

+ v2y.

v = dsdt

For three dimensions the result is

(8.16)In the same way as we deﬁned velocities, we can deﬁne accelerations: we havean x-component of acceleration ax, which is the derivative of vx, the x-componentof the velocity (that is, ax = d2x/dt2, the second derivative of x with respectto t), and so on.Let us consider one nice example of compound motion in a plane. We shalltake a motion in which a ball moves horizontally with a constant velocity u, andat the same time goes vertically downward with a constant acceleration −g; whatis the motion? We can say dx/dt = vx = u. Since the velocity vx is constant,

x = ut,

and since the downward acceleration −g is constant, the distance y the objectfalls can be written as(8.18)What is the curve of its path, i.e., what is the relation between y and x? We caneliminate t from Eq. (8.18), since t = x/u. When we make this substitution weﬁnd that(8.19)This relation between y and x may be considered as the equation of the path ofthe moving ball. When this equation is plotted we obtain a curve that is called aparabola; any freely falling body that is shot out in any direction will travel in aparabola, as shown in Fig. 8-4.
