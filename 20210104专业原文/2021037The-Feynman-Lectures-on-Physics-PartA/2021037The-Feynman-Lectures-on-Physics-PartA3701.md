Quantum Behavior

37-1 Atomic mechanicsIn the last few chapters we have treated the essential ideas necessary for anunderstanding of most of the important phenomena of light—or electromagnetic ra-diation in general. (We have left a few special topics for next year. Speciﬁcally, thetheory of the index of dense materials and total internal reﬂection.) What we havedealt with is called the「classical theory」of electric waves, which turns out to be acompletely adequate description of nature for a large number of eﬀects. We havenot had to worry yet about the fact that light energy comes in lumps or「photons.」We would like to take up as our next subject the problem of the behaviorof relatively large pieces of matter—their mechanical and thermal properties,for instance.In discussing these, we will ﬁnd that the「classical」(or older)theory fails almost immediately, because matter is really made up of atomic-sizedparticles. Still, we will deal only with the classical part, because that is the onlypart that we can understand using the classical mechanics we have been learning.But we shall not be very successful. We shall ﬁnd that in the case of matter,unlike the case of light, we shall be in diﬃculty relatively soon. We could, ofcourse, continuously skirt away from the atomic eﬀects, but we shall insteadinterpose here a short excursion in which we will describe the basic ideas of thequantum properties of matter, i.e., the quantum ideas of atomic physics, so thatyou will have some feeling for what it is we are leaving out. For we will have toleave out some important subjects that we cannot avoid coming close to.

but will not be able actually to get into the subject until much later.

So we will give now the introduction to the subject of quantum mechanics,「Quantum mechanics」is the description of the behavior of matter in all itsdetails and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on avery small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about.They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do notbehave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything thatyou have ever seen.

37-1

Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered,as we have seen here, that it behaves like a wave. Later, however (in the beginningof the twentieth century) it was found that light did indeed sometimes behavelike a particle. Historically, the electron, for example, was thought to behave likea particle, and then it was found that in many respects it behaved like a wave. Soit really behaves like neither. Now we have given up. We say:「It is like neither.」There is one lucky break, however—electrons behave just like light. Thequantum behavior of atomic objects (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, andso on) is the same for all, they are all「particle waves,」or whatever you want tocall them. So what we learn about the properties of electrons (which we shall usefor our examples) will apply also to all「particles,」including photons of light.

The gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small-scale be-havior during the ﬁrst quarter of the 20th century, which gave some indicationsabout how small things do behave, produced an increasing confusion which wasﬁnally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Born. Theyﬁnally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a smallscale. We take up the main features of that description in this chapter.

Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very diﬃcultto get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to thenovice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand itthe way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not,because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to largeobjects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale justdo not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract orimaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience.

In this chapter we shall tackle immediately the basic element of the mysteriousbehavior in its most strange form. We choose to examine a phenomenon which isimpossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which hasin it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery.We cannot explain the mystery in the sense of「explaining」how it works. Wewill tell you how it works. In telling you how it works we will have told youabout the basic peculiarities of all quantum mechanics.

37-2 An experiment with bulletsTo try to understand the quantum behavior of electrons, we shall compareand contrast their behavior, in a particular experimental setup, with the more

37-2

Fig. 37-1. Interference experiment with bullets.

familiar behavior of particles like bullets, and with the behavior of waves like waterwaves. We consider ﬁrst the behavior of bullets in the experimental setup showndiagrammatically in Fig. 37-1. We have a machine gun that shoots a stream ofbullets. It is not a very good gun, in that it sprays the bullets (randomly) over afairly large angular spread, as indicated in the ﬁgure. In front of the gun we havea wall (made of armor plate) that has in it two holes just about big enough to leta bullet through. Beyond the wall is a backstop (say a thick wall of wood) whichwill「absorb」the bullets when they hit it. In front of the wall we have an objectwhich we shall call a「detector」of bullets. It might be a box containing sand.Any bullet that enters the detector will be stopped and accumulated. When wewish, we can empty the box and count the number of bullets that have beencaught. The detector can be moved back and forth (in what we will call thex-direction). With this apparatus, we can ﬁnd out experimentally the answer tothe question:「What is the probability that a bullet which passes through theholes in the wall will arrive at the backstop at the distance x from the center?」First, you should realize that we should talk about probability, because we cannotsay deﬁnitely where any particular bullet will go. A bullet which happens to hitone of the holes may bounce oﬀ the edges of the hole, and may end up anywhereat all. By「probability」we mean the chance that the bullet will arrive at thedetector, which we can measure by counting the number which arrive at thedetector in a certain time and then taking the ratio of this number to the totalnumber that hit the backstop during that time. Or, if we assume that the gunalways shoots at the same rate during the measurements, the probability we want

37-3

is just proportional to the number that reach the detector in some standard timeinterval.

For our present purposes we would like to imagine a somewhat idealizedexperiment in which the bullets are not real bullets, but are indestructible bullets—they cannot break in half. In our experiment we ﬁnd that bullets always arrive inlumps, and when we ﬁnd something in the detector, it is always one whole bullet.If the rate at which the machine gun ﬁres is made very low, we ﬁnd that at anygiven moment either nothing arrives, or one and only one—exactly one—bulletarrives at the backstop. Also, the size of the lump certainly does not depend on therate of ﬁring of the gun. We shall say:「Bullets always arrive in identical lumps.」What we measure with our detector is the probability of arrival of a lump. And wemeasure the probability as a function of x. The result of such measurements withthis apparatus (we have not yet done the experiment, so we are really imaginingthe result) are plotted in the graph drawn in part (c) of Fig. 37-1. In the graphwe plot the probability to the right and x vertically, so that the x-scale ﬁts thediagram of the apparatus. We call the probability P12 because the bullets mayhave come either through hole 1 or through hole 2. You will not be surprised thatP12 is large near the middle of the graph but gets small if x is very large. You maywonder, however, why P12 has its maximum value at x = 0. We can understandthis fact if we do our experiment again after covering up hole 2, and once morewhile covering up hole 1. When hole 2 is covered, bullets can pass only throughhole 1, and we get the curve marked P1 in part (b) of the ﬁgure. As you wouldexpect, the maximum of P1 occurs at the value of x which is on a straight line withthe gun and hole 1. When hole 1 is closed, we get the symmetric curve P2 drawnin the ﬁgure. P2 is the probability distribution for bullets that pass through hole 2.Comparing parts (b) and (c) of Fig. 37-1, we ﬁnd the important result that

P12 = P1 + P2.

(37.1)The probabilities just add together. The eﬀect with both holes open is the sumof the eﬀects with each hole open alone. We shall call this result an observationof「no interference,」for a reason that you will see later. So much for bullets.They come in lumps, and their probability of arrival shows no interference.

37-3 An experiment with wavesNow we wish to consider an experiment with water waves. The apparatusis shown diagrammatically in Fig. 37-2. We have a shallow trough of water. A

37-4

Fig. 37-2. Interference experiment with water waves.

small object labeled the「wave source」is jiggled up and down by a motor andmakes circular waves. To the right of the source we have again a wall with twoholes, and beyond that is a second wall, which, to keep things simple, is an「absorber,」so that there is no reﬂection of the waves that arrive there. This canbe done by building a gradual sand「beach.」In front of the beach we place adetector which can be moved back and forth in the x-direction, as before. Thedetector is now a device which measures the「intensity」of the wave motion. Youcan imagine a gadget which measures the height of the wave motion, but whosescale is calibrated in proportion to the square of the actual height, so that thereading is proportional to the intensity of the wave. Our detector reads, then, inproportion to the energy being carried by the wave—or rather, the rate at whichenergy is carried to the detector.

With our wave apparatus, the ﬁrst thing to notice is that the intensity canhave any size. If the source just moves a very small amount, then there is justa little bit of wave motion at the detector. When there is more motion at thesource, there is more intensity at the detector. The intensity of the wave canhave any value at all. We would not say that there was any「lumpiness」in thewave intensity.

Now let us measure the wave intensity for various values of x (keeping thewave source operating always in the same way). We get the interesting-lookingcurve marked I12 in part (c) of the ﬁgure.

37-5

We have already worked out how such patterns can come about when westudied the interference of electric waves. In this case we would observe that theoriginal wave is diﬀracted at the holes, and new circular waves spread out fromeach hole. If we cover one hole at a time and measure the intensity distribution atthe absorber we ﬁnd the rather simple intensity curves shown in part (b) of theﬁgure. I1 is the intensity of the wave from hole 1 (which we ﬁnd by measuringwhen hole 2 is blocked oﬀ) and I2 is the intensity of the wave from hole 2 (seenwhen hole 1 is blocked).The intensity I12 observed when both holes are open is certainly not the sumof I1 and I2. We say that there is「interference」of the two waves. At some places(where the curve I12 has its maxima) the waves are「in phase」and the wavepeaks add together to give a large amplitude and, therefore, a large intensity.We say that the two waves are「interfering constructively」at such places. Therewill be such constructive interference wherever the distance from the detector toone hole is a whole number of wavelengths larger (or shorter) than the distancefrom the detector to the other hole.

At those places where the two waves arrive at the detector with a phasediﬀerence of π (where they are「out of phase」) the resulting wave motion atthe detector will be the diﬀerence of the two amplitudes. The waves「interferedestructively,」and we get a low value for the wave intensity. We expect such lowvalues wherever the distance between hole 1 and the detector is diﬀerent from thedistance between hole 2 and the detector by an odd number of half-wavelengths.The low values of I12 in Fig. 37-2 correspond to the places where the two wavesinterfere destructively.You will remember that the quantitative relationship between I1, I2, and I12can be expressed in the following way: The instantaneous height of the waterwave at the detector for the wave from hole 1 can be written as (the real partof) ˆh1eiωt, where the「amplitude」ˆh1 is, in general, a complex number. Theintensity is proportional to the mean squared height or, when we use the complexnumbers, to |ˆh1|2. Similarly, for hole 2 the height is ˆh2eiωt and the intensityis proportional to |ˆh2|2. When both holes are open, the wave heights add togive the height (ˆh1 + ˆh2)eiωt and the intensity |ˆh1 + ˆh2|2. Omitting the constantof proportionality for our present purposes, the proper relations for interferingwaves are

(37.2)

I1 = |ˆh1|2,

I2 = |ˆh2|2,

I12 = |ˆh1 + ˆh2|2.

37-6

You will notice that the result is quite diﬀerent from that obtained with

bullets (Eq. 37.1). If we expand |ˆh1 + ˆh2|2 we see that

|ˆh1 + ˆh2|2 = |ˆh1|2 + |ˆh2|2 + 2|ˆh1||ˆh2| cos δ,

(37.3)where δ is the phase diﬀerence between ˆh1 and ˆh2. In terms of the intensities,we could write(37.4)The last term in (37.4) is the「interference term.」So much for water waves. Theintensity can have any value, and it shows interference.

I12 = I1 + I2 + 2p

I1I2 cos δ.

37-4 An experiment with electronsNow we imagine a similar experiment with electrons. It is shown diagram-matically in Fig. 37-3. We make an electron gun which consists of a tungstenwire heated by an electric current and surrounded by a metal box with a hole init. If the wire is at a negative voltage with respect to the box, electrons emittedby the wire will be accelerated toward the walls and some will pass through thehole. All the electrons which come out of the gun will have (nearly) the sameenergy. In front of the gun is again a wall (just a thin metal plate) with twoholes in it. Beyond the wall is another plate which will serve as a「backstop.」

Fig. 37-3. Interference experiment with electrons.

37-7

In front of the backstop we place a movable detector. The detector might be ageiger counter or, perhaps better, an electron multiplier, which is connected toa loudspeaker.

We should say right away that you should not try to set up this experiment (asyou could have done with the two we have already described). This experimenthas never been done in just this way. The trouble is that the apparatus wouldhave to be made on an impossibly small scale to show the eﬀects we are interestedin. We are doing a「thought experiment,」which we have chosen because it is easyto think about. We know the results that would be obtained because there aremany experiments that have been done, in which the scale and the proportionshave been chosen to show the eﬀects we shall describe.

The ﬁrst thing we notice with our electron experiment is that we hear sharp「clicks」from the detector (that is, from the loudspeaker). And all「clicks」arethe same. There are no「half-clicks.」

We would also notice that the「clicks」come very erratically. Something like:click . . . . . click-click . . . click . . . . . . . . click . . . . click-click . . . . . . click . . . , etc.,just as you have, no doubt, heard a geiger counter operating. If we count theclicks which arrive in a suﬃciently long time—say for many minutes—and thencount again for another equal period, we ﬁnd that the two numbers are verynearly the same. So we can speak of the average rate at which the clicks areheard (so-and-so-many clicks per minute on the average).As we move the detector around, the rate at which the clicks appear is fasteror slower, but the size (loudness) of each click is always the same. If we lowerthe temperature of the wire in the gun the rate of clicking slows down, but stilleach click sounds the same. We would notice also that if we put two separatedetectors at the backstop, one or the other would click, but never both at once.(Except that once in a while, if there were two clicks very close together in time,our ear might not sense the separation.) We conclude, therefore, that whateverarrives at the backstop arrives in「lumps.」All the「lumps」are the same size:only whole「lumps」arrive, and they arrive one at a time at the backstop. Weshall say:「Electrons always arrive in identical lumps.」

Just as for our experiment with bullets, we can now proceed to ﬁnd exper-imentally the answer to the question:「What is the relative probability thatan electron ‘lump’ will arrive at the backstop at various distances x from thecenter?」As before, we obtain the relative probability by observing the rate ofclicks, holding the operation of the gun constant. The probability that lumpswill arrive at a particular x is proportional to the average rate of clicks at that x.

37-8

The result of our experiment is the interesting curve marked P12 in part (c)

of Fig. 37-3. Yes! That is the way electrons go.

37-5 The interference of electron wavesNow let us try to analyze the curve of Fig. 37-3 to see whether we canunderstand the behavior of the electrons. The ﬁrst thing we would say is thatsince they come in lumps, each lump, which we may as well call an electron, hascome either through hole 1 or through hole 2. Let us write this in the form of a「Proposition」:

Proposition A: Each electron either goes through hole 1 or it goes through

hole 2.

Assuming Proposition A, all electrons that arrive at the backstop can bedivided into two classes: (1) those that come through hole 1, and (2) those thatcome through hole 2. So our observed curve must be the sum of the eﬀects ofthe electrons which come through hole 1 and the electrons which come throughhole 2. Let us check this idea by experiment. First, we will make a measurementfor those electrons that come through hole 1. We block oﬀ hole 2 and makeour counts of the clicks from the detector. From the clicking rate, we get P1.The result of the measurement is shown by the curve marked P1 in part (b) ofFig. 37-3. The result seems quite reasonable. In a similar way, we measure P2,the probability distribution for the electrons that come through hole 2. Theresult of this measurement is also drawn in the ﬁgure.

The result P12 obtained with both holes open is clearly not the sum of P1and P2, the probabilities for each hole alone. In analogy with our water-waveexperiment, we say:「There is interference.」

P12 6= P1 + P2.

For electrons:

(37.5)How can such an interference come about? Perhaps we should say:「Well,that means, presumably, that it is not true that the lumps go either throughhole 1 or hole 2, because if they did, the probabilities should add. Perhaps theygo in a more complicated way. They split in half and . . . 」But no! They cannot,they always arrive in lumps . . .「Well, perhaps some of them go through 1, andthen they go around through 2, and then around a few more times, or by someother complicated path . . . then by closing hole 2, we changed the chance thatan electron that started out through hole 1 would ﬁnally get to the backstop . . . 」

37-9

But notice! There are some points at which very few electrons arrive when bothholes are open, but which receive many electrons if we close one hole, so closingone hole increased the number from the other. Notice, however, that at thecenter of the pattern, P12 is more than twice as large as P1 + P2. It is as thoughclosing one hole decreased the number of electrons which come through the otherhole. It seems hard to explain both eﬀects by proposing that the electrons travelin complicated paths.

It is all quite mysterious. And the more you look at it the more mysteriousit seems. Many ideas have been concocted to try to explain the curve for P12in terms of individual electrons going around in complicated ways through theholes. None of them has succeeded. None of them can get the right curve for P12in terms of P1 and P2.

Yet, surprisingly enough, the mathematics for relating P1 and P2 to P12 isextremely simple. For P12 is just like the curve I12 of Fig. 37-2, and that wassimple. What is going on at the backstop can be described by two complexnumbers that we can call ˆφ1 and ˆφ2 (they are functions of x, of course). Theabsolute square of ˆφ1 gives the eﬀect with only hole 1 open. That is, P1 = |ˆφ1|2.The eﬀect with only hole 2 open is given by ˆφ2 in the same way. That is,P2 = |ˆφ2|2. And the combined eﬀect of the two holes is just P12 = |ˆφ1 + ˆφ2|2.The mathematics is the same as that we had for the water waves! (It is hard tosee how one could get such a simple result from a complicated game of electronsgoing back and forth through the plate on some strange trajectory.)

We conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like particles, andthe probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed like the distribution ofintensity of a wave. It is in this sense that an electron behaves「sometimes like aparticle and sometimes like a wave.」

Incidentally, when we were dealing with classical waves we deﬁned the intensityas the mean over time of the square of the wave amplitude, and we used complexnumbers as a mathematical trick to simplify the analysis. But in quantummechanics it turns out that the amplitudes must be represented by complexnumbers. The real parts alone will not do. That is a technical point, for themoment, because the formulas look just the same.

Since the probability of arrival through both holes is given so simply, althoughit is not equal to (P1 + P2), that is really all there is to say. But there are alarge number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature does work this way.We would like to illustrate some of these subtleties for you now. First, since the

37-10

number that arrives at a particular point is not equal to the number that arrivesthrough 1 plus the number that arrives through 2, as we would have concludedfrom Proposition A, undoubtedly we should conclude that Proposition A is false.It is not true that the electrons go either through hole 1 or hole 2. But thatconclusion can be tested by another experiment.

37-6 Watching the electronsWe shall now try the following experiment. To our electron apparatus we adda very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two holes,as shown in Fig. 37-4. We know that electric charges scatter light. So when anelectron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scattersome light to our eye, and we can see where the electron goes. If, for instance,an electron were to take the path via hole 2 that is sketched in Fig. 37-4, weshould see a ﬂash of light coming from the vicinity of the place marked A in theﬁgure. If an electron passes through hole 1 we would expect to see a ﬂash fromthe vicinity of the upper hole. If it should happen that we get light from bothplaces at the same time, because the electron divides in half . . . Let us just dothe experiment!

Fig. 37-4. A diﬀerent electron experiment.

Here is what we see: every time that we hear a「click」from our electrondetector (at the backstop), we also see a ﬂash of light either near hole 1 or nearhole 2, but never both at once! And we observe the same result no matter where

37-11

we put the detector. From this observation we conclude that when we look atthe electrons we ﬁnd that the electrons go either through one hole or the other.Experimentally, Proposition A is necessarily true.

What, then, is wrong with our argument against Proposition A? Why isn’t P12just equal to P1 + P2? Back to experiment! Let us keep track of the electronsand ﬁnd out what they are doing. For each position (x-location) of the detectorwe will count the electrons that arrive and also keep track of which hole theywent through, by watching for the ﬂashes. We can keep track of things thisway: whenever we hear a「click」we will put a count in Column 1 if we see theﬂash near hole 1, and if we see the ﬂash near hole 2, we will record a countin Column 2. Every electron which arrives is recorded in one of two classes:those which come through 1 and those which come through 2. From the numberrecorded in Column 1 we get the probability P 01 that an electron will arrive atthe detector via hole 1; and from the number recorded in Column 2 we get P 02,the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector via hole 2. If we nowrepeat such a measurement for many values of x, we get the curves for P 01 and P 02shown in part (b) of Fig. 37-4.1 something quite similar towhat we got before for P1 by blocking oﬀ hole 2; and P 02 is similar to what we gotby blocking hole 1. So there is not any complicated business like going throughboth holes. When we watch them, the electrons come through just as we wouldexpect them to come through. Whether the holes are closed or open, those whichwe see come through hole 1 are distributed in the same way whether hole 2 isopen or closed.

Well, that is not too surprising! We get for P 0

But wait! What do we have now for the total probability, the probabilitythat an electron will arrive at the detector by any route? We already have thatinformation. We just pretend that we never looked at the light ﬂashes, and welump together the detector clicks which we have separated into the two columns.We must just add the numbers. For the probability that an electron will arriveat the backstop by passing through either hole, we do ﬁnd P 012 = P 01 + P 02. Thatis, although we succeeded in watching which hole our electrons come through,we no longer get the old interference curve P12, but a new one, P 012 showing nointerference! If we turn out the light P12 is restored.We must conclude that when we look at the electrons the distribution of themon the screen is diﬀerent than when we do not look. Perhaps it is turning onour light source that disturbs things? It must be that the electrons are verydelicate, and the light, when it scatters oﬀ the electrons, gives them a jolt that

37-12

changes their motion. We know that the electric ﬁeld of the light acting on acharge will exert a force on it. So perhaps we should expect the motion to bechanged. Anyway, the light exerts a big inﬂuence on the electrons. By trying to「watch」the electrons we have changed their motions. That is, the jolt given tothe electron when the photon is scattered by it is such as to change the electron’smotion enough so that if it might have gone to where P12 was at a maximum itwill instead land where P12 was a minimum; that is why we no longer see thewavy interference eﬀects.You may be thinking:「Don’t use such a bright source! Turn the brightnessdown! The light waves will then be weaker and will not disturb the electrons somuch. Surely, by making the light dimmer and dimmer, eventually the wave willbe weak enough that it will have a negligible eﬀect.」O.K. Let’s try it. The ﬁrstthing we observe is that the ﬂashes of light scattered from the electrons as theypass by does not get weaker. It is always the same-sized ﬂash. The only thingthat happens as the light is made dimmer is that sometimes we hear a「click」from the detector but see no ﬂash at all. The electron has gone by without being「seen.」What we are observing is that light also acts like electrons, we knew thatit was「wavy,」but now we ﬁnd that it is also「lumpy.」It always arrives—or isscattered—in lumps that we call「photons.」As we turn down the intensity ofthe light source we do not change the size of the photons, only the rate at whichthey are emitted. That explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons getby without being seen. There did not happen to be a photon around at the timethe electron went through.

This is all a little discouraging. If it is true that whenever we「see」the electronwe see the same-sized ﬂash, then those electrons we see are always the disturbedones. Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway. Now whenever wehear a click in the detector we will keep a count in three columns: in Column (1)those electrons seen by hole 1, in Column (2) those electrons seen by hole 2,and in Column (3) those electrons not seen at all. When we work up our data(computing the probabilities) we ﬁnd these results: Those「seen by hole 1」havea distribution like P 02 (so thatthose「seen by either hole 1 or 2」have a distribution like P 012); and those「notseen at all」have a「wavy」distribution just like P12 of Fig. 37-3! If the electronsare not seen, we have interference!That is understandable. When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbsit, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it. There is always the sameamount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized

1; those「seen by hole 2」have a distribution like P 0

37-13

eﬀects and the eﬀect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out anyinterference eﬀect.

Is there not some way we can see the electrons without disturbing them?We learned in an earlier chapter that the momentum carried by a「photon」isinversely proportional to its wavelength (p = h/λ). Certainly the jolt givento the electron when the photon is scattered toward our eye depends on themomentum that photon carries. Aha! If we want to disturb the electrons onlyslightly we should not have lowered the intensity of the light, we should havelowered its frequency (the same as increasing its wavelength). Let us use light ofa redder color. We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and「see」where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can「see」light of these longer wavelengths. If we use「gentler」light perhaps we can avoiddisturbing the electrons so much.

Let us try the experiment with longer waves. We shall keep repeating ourexperiment, each time with light of a longer wavelength. At ﬁrst, nothing seems tochange. The results are the same. Then a terrible thing happens. You rememberthat when we discussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the wavenature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and stillbe seen as two separate spots. This distance is of the order of the wavelength oflight. So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance betweenour holes, we see a big fuzzy ﬂash when the light is scattered by the electrons.We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through! We just know it wentsomewhere! And it is just with light of this color that we ﬁnd that the jolts givento the electron are small enough so that P 012 begins to look like P12—that webegin to get some interference eﬀect. And it is only for wavelengths much longerthan the separation of the two holes (when we have no chance at all of tellingwhere the electron went) that the disturbance due to the light gets suﬃcientlysmall that we again get the curve P12 shown in Fig. 37-3.In our experiment we ﬁnd that it is impossible to arrange the light in sucha way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the sametime not disturb the pattern. It was suggested by Heisenberg that the thennew laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitationon our experimental capabilities not previously recognized. He proposed, as ageneral principle, his uncertainty principle, which we can state in terms of ourexperiment as follows:「It is impossible to design an apparatus to determinewhich hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb theelectrons enough to destroy the interference pattern.」If an apparatus is capable

37-14

of determining which hole the electron goes through, it cannot be so delicatethat it does not disturb the pattern in an essential way. No one has ever found(or even thought of) a way around the uncertainty principle. So we must assumethat it describes a basic characteristic of nature.

The complete theory of quantum mechanics which we now use to describeatoms and, in fact, all matter depends on the correctness of the uncertaintyprinciple. Since quantum mechanics is such a successful theory, our belief inthe uncertainty principle is reinforced. But if a way to「beat」the uncertaintyprinciple were ever discovered, quantum mechanics would give inconsistent resultsand would have to be discarded as a valid theory of nature.

「Well,」you say,「what about Proposition A? It is true, or is it not true, thatthe electron either goes through hole 1 or it goes through hole 2?」The onlyanswer that can be given is that we have found from experiment that there isa certain special way that we have to think in order that we do not get intoinconsistencies. What we must say (to avoid making wrong predictions) is thefollowing. If one looks at the holes or, more accurately, if one has a piece ofapparatus which is capable of determining whether the electrons go throughhole 1 or hole 2, then one can say that it goes either through hole 1 or hole 2.But, when one does not try to tell which way the electron goes, when there isnothing in the experiment to disturb the electrons, then one may not say thatan electron goes either through hole 1 or hole 2. If one does say that, and startsto make any deductions from the statement, he will make errors in the analysis.This is the logical tightrope on which we must walk if we wish to describe naturesuccessfully.

If the motion of all matter—as well as electrons—must be described in termsof waves, what about the bullets in our ﬁrst experiment? Why didn’t we seean interference pattern there? It turns out that for the bullets the wavelengthswere so tiny that the interference patterns became very ﬁne. So ﬁne, in fact, thatwith any detector of ﬁnite size one could not distinguish the separate maximaand minima. What we saw was only a kind of average, which is the classicalcurve. In Fig. 37-5 we have tried to indicate schematically what happens withlarge-scale objects. Part (a) of the ﬁgure shows the probability distributionone might predict for bullets, using quantum mechanics. The rapid wiggles aresupposed to represent the interference pattern one gets for waves of very shortwavelength. Any physical detector, however, straddles several wiggles of the

probability curve, so that the measurements show the smooth curve drawn inpart (b) of the ﬁgure.

37-7 First principles of quantum mechanicsWe will now write a summary of the main conclusions of our experiments. Wewill, however, put the results in a form which makes them true for a general classof such experiments. We can write our summary more simply if we ﬁrst deﬁnean「ideal experiment」as one in which there are no uncertain external inﬂuences,i.e., no jiggling or other things going on that we cannot take into account. Wewould be quite precise if we said:「An ideal experiment is one in which all of theinitial and ﬁnal conditions of the experiment are completely speciﬁed.」What wewill call「an event」is, in general, just a speciﬁc set of initial and ﬁnal conditions.(For example:「an electron leaves the gun, arrives at the detector, and nothingelse happens.」) Now for our summary.

Summary

(1) The probability of an event in an ideal experiment is given by the squareof the absolute value of a complex number φ which is called the probabilityamplitude:

P = probability,φ = probability amplitude,P = |φ|2.

37-16

(37.6)

(2) When an event can occur in several alternative ways, the probabilityamplitude for the event is the sum of the probability amplitudes for eachway considered separately. There is interference:

φ = φ1 + φ2,P = |φ1 + φ2|2.

(37.7)

(3) If an experiment is performed which is capable of determining whether oneor another alternative is actually taken, the probability of the event is thesum of the probabilities for each alternative. The interference is lost:

P = P1 + P2.

(37.8)

One might still like to ask:「How does it work? What is the machinerybehind the law?」No one has found any machinery behind the law. No one can「explain」any more than we have just「explained.」No one will give you any deeperrepresentation of the situation. We have no ideas about a more basic mechanismfrom which these results can be deduced.

We would like to emphasize a very important diﬀerence between classical andquantum mechanics. We have been talking about the probability that an electronwill arrive in a given circumstance. We have implied that in our experimentalarrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predictexactly what would happen. We can only predict the odds! This would mean, ifit were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactlywhat will happen in a deﬁnite circumstance. Yes! physics has given up. We donot know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and webelieve now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is theprobability of diﬀerent events. It must be recognized that this is a retrenchmentin our earlier ideal of understanding nature. It may be a backward step, but noone has seen a way to avoid it.

We make now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been madeto try to avoid the description we have given:「Perhaps the electron has somekind of internal works—some inner variables—that we do not yet know about.Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what will happen. If we could look moreclosely at the electron we could be able to tell where it would end up.」So far aswe know, that is impossible. We would still be in diﬃculty. Suppose we were toassume that inside the electron there is some kind of machinery that determines

37-17

where it is going to end up. That machine must also determine which hole it isgoing to go through on its way. But we must not forget that what is inside theelectron should not be dependent on what we do, and in particular upon whetherwe open or close one of the holes. So if an electron, before it starts, has alreadymade up its mind (a) which hole it is going to use, and (b) where it is going toland, we should ﬁnd P1 for those electrons that have chosen hole 1, P2 for thosethat have chosen hole 2, and necessarily the sum P1 + P2 for those that arrivethrough the two holes. There seems to be no way around this. But we haveveriﬁed experimentally that that is not the case. And no one has ﬁgured a wayout of this puzzle. So at the present time we must limit ourselves to computingprobabilities. We say「at the present time,」but we suspect very strongly thatit is something that will be with us forever—that it is impossible to beat thatpuzzle—that this is the way nature really is.

37-8 The uncertainty principleThis is the way Heisenberg stated the uncertainty principle originally: If youmake the measurement on any object, and you can determine the x-componentof its momentum with an uncertainty ∆p, you cannot, at the same time, know itsx-position more accurately than ∆x ≥ /2∆p. The uncertainties in the positionand momentum at any instant must have their product greater than half thereduced Planck constant. This is a special case of the uncertainty principle thatwas stated above more generally. The more general statement was that onecannot design equipment in any way to determine which of two alternatives istaken, without, at the same time, destroying the pattern of interference.

Let us show for one particular case that the kind of relation given by Heisenbergmust be true in order to keep from getting into trouble. We imagine a modiﬁcationof the experiment of Fig. 37-3, in which the wall with the holes consists of a platemounted on rollers so that it can move freely up and down (in the x-direction),as shown in Fig. 37-6. By watching the motion of the plate carefully we cantry to tell which hole an electron goes through. Imagine what happens whenthe detector is placed at x = 0. We would expect that an electron which passesthrough hole 1 must be deﬂected downward by the plate to reach the detector.Since the vertical component of the electron momentum is changed, the platemust recoil with an equal momentum in the opposite direction. The plate willget an upward kick. If the electron goes through the lower hole, the plate shouldfeel a downward kick. It is clear that for every position of the detector, the

momentum received by the plate will have a diﬀerent value for a traversal viahole 1 than for a traversal via hole 2. So! Without disturbing the electrons atall, but just by watching the plate, we can tell which path the electron used.

Now in order to do this it is necessary to know what the momentum of thescreen is, before the electron goes through. So when we measure the momentumafter the electron goes by, we can ﬁgure out how much the plate’s momentum haschanged. But remember, according to the uncertainty principle we cannot at thesame time know the position of the plate with an arbitrary accuracy. But if we donot know exactly where the plate is we cannot say precisely where the two holesare. They will be in a diﬀerent place for every electron that goes through. Thismeans that the center of our interference pattern will have a diﬀerent location foreach electron. The wiggles of the interference pattern will be smeared out. Weshall show quantitatively in the next chapter that if we determine the momentumof the plate suﬃciently accurately to determine from the recoil measurementwhich hole was used, then the uncertainty in the x-position of the plate will,according to the uncertainty principle, be enough to shift the pattern observed atthe detector up and down in the x-direction about the distance from a maximumto its nearest minimum. Such a random shift is just enough to smear out thepattern so that no interference is observed.

The uncertainty principle「protects」quantum mechanics. Heisenberg rec-ognized that if it were possible to measure the momentum and the positionsimultaneously with a greater accuracy, the quantum mechanics would collapse.So he proposed that it must be impossible. Then people sat down and tried to

37-19

ﬁgure out ways of doing it, and nobody could ﬁgure out a way to measure theposition and the momentum of anything—a screen, an electron, a billiard ball,anything—with any greater accuracy. Quantum mechanics maintains its perilousbut accurate existence.
