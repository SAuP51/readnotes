Work and Potential Energy (conclusion)

14-1 WorkIn the preceding chapter we have presented a great many new ideas andresults that play a central role in physics. These ideas are so important that itseems worth while to devote a whole chapter to a closer examination of them.In the present chapter we shall not repeat the「proofs」or the speciﬁc tricks bywhich the results were obtained, but shall concentrate instead upon a discussionof the ideas themselves.

In learning any subject of a technical nature where mathematics plays a role,one is confronted with the task of understanding and storing away in the memorya huge body of facts and ideas, held together by certain relationships which canbe「proved」or「shown」to exist between them. It is easy to confuse the proofitself with the relationship which it establishes. Clearly, the important thingto learn and to remember is the relationship, not the proof. In any particularcircumstance we can either say「it can be shown that」such and such is true, orwe can show it. In almost all cases, the particular proof that is used is concocted,ﬁrst of all, in such form that it can be written quickly and easily on the chalkboardor on paper, and so that it will be as smooth-looking as possible. Consequently,the proof may look deceptively simple, when in fact, the author might haveworked for hours trying diﬀerent ways of calculating the same thing until he hasfound the neatest way, so as to be able to show that it can be shown in theshortest amount of time! The thing to be remembered, when seeing a proof, isnot the proof itself, but rather that it can be shown that such and such is true.Of course, if the proof involves some mathematical procedures or「tricks」thatone has not seen before, attention should be given not to the trick exactly, butto the mathematical idea involved.

It is certain that in all the demonstrations that are made in a course suchas this, not one has been remembered from the time when the author studied

14-1

freshman physics. Quite the contrary: he merely remembers that such and suchis true, and to explain how it can be shown he invents a demonstration at themoment it is needed. Anyone who has really learned a subject should be ableto follow a similar procedure, but it is no use remembering the proofs. That iswhy, in this chapter, we shall avoid the proofs of the various statements madepreviously, and merely summarize the results.

The ﬁrst idea that has to be digested is work done by a force. The physicalword「work」is not the word in the ordinary sense of「Workers of the world

unite!,」but is a diﬀerent idea. Physical work is expressed asR F · ds, called「the

line integral of F dot ds,」which means that if the force, for instance, is in onedirection and the object on which the force is working is displaced in a certaindirection, then only the component of force in the direction of the displacementdoes any work. If, for instance, the force were constant and the displacementwere a ﬁnite distance ∆s, then the work done in moving the object through thatdistance is only the component of force along ∆s times ∆s. The rule is「forcetimes distance,」but we really mean only the component of force in the directionof the displacement times ∆s or, equivalently, the component of displacement inthe direction of force times F. It is evident that no work whatsoever is done bya force which is at right angles to the displacement.Now if the vector displacement ∆s is resolved into components, in otherwords, if the actual displacement is ∆s and we want to consider it eﬀectivelyas a component of displacement ∆x in the x-direction, ∆y in the y-direction,and ∆z in the z-direction, then the work done in carrying an object from oneplace to another can be calculated in three parts, by calculating the work donealong x, along y, and along z. The work done in going along x involves only thatcomponent of force, namely Fx, and so on, so the work is Fx ∆x + Fy ∆y + Fz ∆z.When the force is not constant, and we have a complicated curved motion, thenwe must resolve the path into a lot of little ∆s’s, add the work done in carryingthe object along each ∆s, and take the limit as ∆s goes to zero. This is themeaning of the「line integral.」

Everything we have just said is contained in the formula W =R F · ds. It

is all very well to say that it is a marvelous formula, but it is another thing tounderstand what it means, or what some of the consequences are.

The word「work」in physics has a meaning so diﬀerent from that of the wordas it is used in ordinary circumstances that it must be observed carefully thatthere are some peculiar circumstances in which it appears not to be the same.For example, according to the physical deﬁnition of work, if one holds a hundred-

14-2

pound weight oﬀ the ground for a while, he is doing no work. Nevertheless,everyone knows that he begins to sweat, shake, and breathe harder, as if he wererunning up a ﬂight of stairs. Yet running upstairs is considered as doing work(in running downstairs, one gets work out of the world, according to physics),but in simply holding an object in a ﬁxed position, no work is done. Clearly, thephysical deﬁnition of work diﬀers from the physiological deﬁnition, for reasonswe shall brieﬂy explore.

It is a fact that when one holds a weight he has to do「physiological」work.Why should he sweat? Why should he need to consume food to hold the weightup? Why is the machinery inside him operating at full throttle, just to holdthe weight up? Actually, the weight could be held up with no eﬀort by justplacing it on a table; then the table, quietly and calmly, without any supply ofenergy, is able to maintain the same weight at the same height! The physiologicalsituation is something like the following. There are two kinds of muscles in thehuman body and in other animals: one kind, called striated or skeletal muscle, isthe type of muscle we have in our arms, for example, which is under voluntarycontrol; the other kind, called smooth muscle, is like the muscle in the intestinesor, in the clam, the greater adductor muscle that closes the shell. The smoothmuscles work very slowly, but they can hold a「set」; that is to say, if the clamtries to close its shell in a certain position, it will hold that position, even if thereis a very great force trying to change it. It will hold a position under load forhours and hours without getting tired because it is very much like a table holdingup a weight, it「sets」into a certain position, and the molecules just lock theretemporarily with no work being done, no eﬀort being generated by the clam.The fact that we have to generate eﬀort to hold up a weight is simply due to thedesign of striated muscle. What happens is that when a nerve impulse reaches amuscle ﬁber, the ﬁber gives a little twitch and then relaxes, so that when we holdsomething up, enormous volleys of nerve impulses are coming in to the muscle,large numbers of twitches are maintaining the weight, while the other ﬁbers relax.We can see this, of course: when we hold a heavy weight and get tired, we beginto shake. The reason is that the volleys are coming irregularly, and the muscleis tired and not reacting fast enough. Why such an ineﬃcient scheme? We donot know exactly why, but evolution has not been able to develop fast smoothmuscle. Smooth muscle would be much more eﬀective for holding up weightsbecause you could just stand there and it would lock in; there would be no workinvolved and no energy would be required. However, it has the disadvantage thatit is very slow-operating.

14-3

Returning now to physics, we may ask why we want to calculate the workdone. The answer is that it is interesting and useful to do so, since the work doneon a particle by the resultant of all the forces acting on it is exactly equal to thechange in kinetic energy of that particle. That is, if an object is being pushed, itpicks up speed, and

∆(v2) = 2

F · ∆s.

14-2 Constrained motionAnother interesting feature of forces and work is this: suppose that we havea sloping or a curved track, and a particle that must move along the track, butwithout friction. Or we may have a pendulum with a string and a weight; thestring constrains the weight to move in a circle about the pivot point. The pivotpoint may be changed by having the string hit a peg, so that the path of theweight is along two circles of diﬀerent radii. These are examples of what we callﬁxed, frictionless constraints.In motion with a ﬁxed frictionless constraint, no work is done by the constraintbecause the forces of constraint are always at right angles to the motion. Bythe「forces of constraint」we mean those forces which are applied to the objectdirectly by the constraint itself—the contact force with the track, or the tensionin the string.

The forces involved in the motion of a particle on a slope moving under theinﬂuence of gravity are quite complicated, since there is a constraint force, agravitational force, and so on. However, if we base our calculation of the motionon conservation of energy and the gravitational force alone, we get the right result.This seems rather strange, because it is not strictly the right way to do it—weshould use the resultant force. Nevertheless, the work done by the gravitationalforce alone will turn out to be the change in the kinetic energy, because the workdone by the constraint part of the force is zero (Fig. 14-1).

Fig. 14-1. Forces acting on a sliding body (no friction).

14-4

The important feature here is that if a force can be analyzed as the sum oftwo or more「pieces」then the work done by the resultant force in going along acertain curve is the sum of the works done by the various「component」forces intowhich the force is analyzed. Thus if we analyze the force as being the vector sumof several eﬀects, gravitational plus constraint forces, etc., or the x-component ofall forces and the y-component of all forces, or any other way that we wish tosplit it up, then the work done by the net force is equal to the sum of the worksdone by all the parts into which we have divided the force in making the analysis.

14-3 Conservative forcesIn nature there are certain forces, that of gravity, for example, which have avery remarkable property which we call「conservative」(no political ideas involved,it is again one of those「crazy words」). If we calculate how much work is doneby a force in moving an object from one point to another along some curvedpath, in general the work depends upon the curve, but in special cases it doesnot. If it does not depend upon the curve, we say that the force is a conservativeforce. In other words, if the integral of the force times the distance in going fromposition 1 to position 2 in Fig. 14-2 is calculated along curve A and then along B,we get the same number of joules, and if this is true for this pair of points onevery curve, and if the same proposition works no matter which pair of pointswe use, then we say the force is conservative. In such circumstances, the workintegral going from 1 to 2 can be evaluated in a simple manner, and we can givea formula for the result. Ordinarily it is not this easy, because we also have tospecify the curve, but when we have a case where the work does not depend onthe curve, then, of course, the work depends only upon the positions of 1 and 2.

Fig. 14-2. Possible paths between two points in a ﬁeld of force.

To demonstrate this idea, consider the following. We take a「standard」point P, at an arbitrary location (Fig. 14-2). Then, the work line-integral from 1to 2, which we want to calculate, can be evaluated as the work done in going

14-5

from 1 to P plus the work done in going from P to 2, because the forces areconservative and the work does not depend upon the curve. Now, the work donein going from position P to a particular position in space is a function of thatposition in space. Of course it really depends on P also, but we hold the arbitrarypoint P ﬁxed permanently for the analysis. If that is done, then the work donein going from point P to point 2 is some function of the ﬁnal position of 2. Itdepends upon where 2 is; if we go to some other point we get a diﬀerent answer.We shall call this function of position −U(x, y, z), and when we wish to referto some particular point 2 whose coordinates are (x2, y2, z2), we shall write U(2),as an abbreviation for U(x2, y2, z2). The work done in going from point 1 topoint P can be written also by going the other way along the integral, reversingall the ds’s. That is, the work done in going from 1 to P is minus the work donein going from the point P to 1:

Z P

Z 1

F · ds =

F · (−ds) = −

F · ds.

P

P

Thus the work done in going from P to 1 is −U(1), and from P to 2 the workis −U(2). Therefore the integral from 1 to 2 is equal to −U(2) plus [−U(1)backwards], or +U(1) − U(2):

U(1) = −

F · ds,

U(2) = −

F · ds,

P

F · ds = U(1) − U(2).

(14.1)

The quantity U(1) − U(2) is called the change in the potential energy, andwe call U the potential energy. We shall say that when the object is locatedat position 2, it has potential energy U(2) and at position 1 it has potentialenergy U(1). If it is located at position P, it has zero potential energy. If we hadused any other point, say Q, instead of P, it would turn out (and we shall leave itto you to demonstrate) that the potential energy is changed only by the additionof a constant. Since the conservation of energy depends only upon changes, itdoes not matter if we add a constant to the potential energy. Thus the point Pis arbitrary.Now, we have the following two propositions: (1) that the work done by a forceis equal to the change in kinetic energy of the particle, but (2) mathematically,

14-6

Z 1

for a conservative force, the work done is minus the change in a function U whichwe call the potential energy. As a consequence of these two, we arrive at theproposition that if only conservative forces act, the kinetic energy T plus thepotential energy U remains constant:

T + U = constant.

(14.2)

Let us now discuss the formulas for the potential energy for a number of cases.If we have a gravitational ﬁeld that is uniform, if we are not going to heightscomparable with the radius of the earth, then the force is a constant verticalforce and the work done is simply the force times the vertical distance. Thus

U(z) = mgz,

(14.3)and the point P which corresponds to zero potential energy happens to be anypoint in the plane z = 0. We could also have said that the potential energyis mg(z − 6) if we had wanted to—all the results would, of course, be the same inour analysis except that the value of the potential energy at z = 0 would be −mg6.It makes no diﬀerence, because only diﬀerences in potential energy count.The energy needed to compress a linear spring a distance x from an equilibriumpoint is(14.4)and the zero of potential energy is at the point x = 0, the equilibrium position ofthe spring. Again we could add any constant we wish.The potential energy of gravitation for point masses M and m, a distance r(14.5)The constant has been chosen here so that the potential is zero at inﬁnity. Ofcourse the same formula applies to electrical charges, because it is the same law:

U(r) = −GM m/r.

U(x) = 1

2 kx2,

apart, is

U(r) = q1q2/4π0r.

(14.6)

Now let us actually use one of these formulas, to see whether we understandwhat it means. Question: How fast do we have to shoot a rocket away from theearth in order for it to leave? Solution: The kinetic plus potential energy mustbe a constant; when it「leaves,」it will be millions of miles away, and if it is justbarely able to leave, we may suppose that it is moving with zero speed out there,

14-7

just barely going. Let a be the radius of the earth, and M its mass. The kinetic2 mv2 − GmM/a. At the end ofplus potential energy is then initially given by 1the motion the two energies must be equal. The kinetic energy is taken to be zeroat the end of the motion, because it is supposed to be just barely drifting awayat essentially zero speed, and the potential energy is GmM divided by inﬁnity,which is zero. So everything is zero on one side and that tells us that the squareof the velocity must be 2GM/a. But GM/a2 is what we call the acceleration ofgravity, g. Thus

v2 = 2ga.

At what speed must a satellite travel in order to keep going around the earth?We worked this out long ago and found that v2 = GM/a. Therefore to go awayfrom the earth, we need √2 times the velocity we need to just go around theearth near its surface. We need, in other words, twice as much energy (becauseenergy goes as the square of the velocity) to leave the earth as we do to go aroundit. Therefore the ﬁrst thing that was done historically with satellites was to getone to go around the earth, which requires a speed of ﬁve miles per second. Thenext thing was to send a satellite away from the earth permanently; this requiredtwice the energy, or about seven miles per second.

Now, continuing our discussion of the characteristics of potential energy, letus consider the interaction of two molecules, or two atoms, two oxygen atomsfor instance. When they are very far apart, the force is one of attraction, whichvaries as the inverse seventh power of the distance, and when they are very closethe force is a very large repulsion. If we integrate the inverse seventh power toﬁnd the work done, we ﬁnd that the potential energy U, which is a function ofthe radial distance between the two oxygen atoms, varies as the inverse sixthpower of the distance for large distances.

If we sketch the curve of the potential energy U(r) as in Fig. 14-3, we thusstart out at large r with an inverse sixth power, but if we come in suﬃcientlynear we reach a point d where there is a minimum of potential energy. Theminimum of potential energy at r = d means this: if we start at d and movea small distance, a very small distance, the work done, which is the change inpotential energy when we move this distance, is nearly zero, because there isvery little change in potential energy at the bottom of the curve. Thus there isno force at this point, and so it is the equilibrium point. Another way to seethat it is the equilibrium point is that it takes work to move away from d ineither direction. When the two oxygen atoms have settled down, so that no more

the distance between them.

energy can be liberated from the force between them, they are in the lowestenergy state, and they will be at this separation d. This is the way an oxygenmolecule looks when it is cold. When we heat it up, the atoms shake and movefarther apart, and we can in fact break them apart, but to do so takes a certainamount of work or energy, which is the potential energy diﬀerence between r = dand r = ∞. When we try to push the atoms very close together the energy goesup very rapidly, because they repel each other.

The reason we bring this out is that the idea of force is not particularlysuitable for quantum mechanics; there the idea of energy is most natural. We ﬁndthat although forces and velocities「dissolve」and disappear when we considerthe more advanced forces between nuclear matter and between molecules and soon, the energy concept remains. Therefore we ﬁnd curves of potential energy inquantum mechanics books, but very rarely do we ever see a curve for the forcebetween two molecules, because by that time people who are doing analyses arethinking in terms of energy rather than of force.

Next we note that if several conservative forces are acting on an object at thesame time, then the potential energy of the object is the sum of the potentialenergies from each of the separate forces. This is the same proposition that wementioned before, because if the force can be represented as a vector sum offorces, then the work done by the total force is the sum of the works done bythe partial forces, and it can therefore be analyzed as changes in the potentialenergies of each of them separately. Thus the total potential energy is the sumof all the little pieces.

We could generalize this to the case of a system of many objects interactingwith one another, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, etc., or oxygen, nitrogen, carbon,

14-9

etc., which are acting with respect to one another in pairs due to forces all ofwhich are conservative. In these circumstances the kinetic energy in the entiresystem is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of all of the particular atoms orplanets or whatever, and the potential energy of the system is the sum, over thepairs of particles, of the potential energy of mutual interaction of a single pair,as though the others were not there. (This is really not true for molecular forces,and the formula is somewhat more complicated; it certainly is true for Newtoniangravitation, and it is true as an approximation for molecular forces. For molecularforces there is a potential energy, but it is sometimes a more complicated functionof the positions of the atoms than simply a sum of terms from pairs.) In thespecial case of gravity, therefore, the potential energy is the sum, over all thepairs i and j, of −Gmimj/rij, as was indicated in Eq. (13.14). Equation (13.14)expressed mathematically the following proposition: that the total kinetic energyplus the total potential energy does not change with time. As the various planetswheel about, and turn and twist and so on, if we calculate the total kinetic energyand the total potential energy we ﬁnd that the total remains constant.

14-4 Nonconservative forcesWe have spent a considerable time discussing conservative forces; what aboutnonconservative forces? We shall take a deeper view of this than is usual, and statethat there are no nonconservative forces! As a matter of fact, all the fundamentalforces in nature appear to be conservative. This is not a consequence of Newton’slaws. In fact, so far as Newton himself knew, the forces could be nonconservative,as friction apparently is. When we say friction apparently is, we are taking amodern view, in which it has been discovered that all the deep forces, the forcesbetween the particles at the most fundamental level, are conservative.

If, for example, we analyze a system like that great globular star cluster thatwe saw a picture of, with the thousands of stars all interacting, then the formulafor the total potential energy is simply one term plus another term, etc., summedover all pairs of stars, and the kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies ofall the individual stars. But the globular cluster as a whole is drifting in spacetoo, and, if we were far enough away from it and did not see the details, couldbe thought of as a single object. Then if forces were applied to it, some of thoseforces might end up driving it forward as a whole, and we would see the centerof the whole thing moving. On the other hand, some of the forces can be, so tospeak,「wasted」in increasing the kinetic or potential energy of the「particles」

14-10

inside. Let us suppose, for instance, that the action of these forces expands thewhole cluster and makes the particles move faster. The total energy of the wholething is really conserved, but seen from the outside with our crude eyes whichcannot see the confusion of motions inside, and just thinking of the kinetic energyof the motion of the whole object as though it were a single particle, it wouldappear that energy is not conserved, but this is due to a lack of appreciation ofwhat it is that we see. And that, it turns out, is the case: the total energy of theworld, kinetic plus potential, is a constant when we look closely enough.

When we study matter in the ﬁnest detail at the atomic level, it is not alwayseasy to separate the total energy of a thing into two parts, kinetic energy andpotential energy, and such separation is not always necessary. It is almost alwayspossible to do it, so let us say that it is always possible, and that the potential-plus-kinetic energy of the world is constant. Thus the total potential-plus-kineticenergy inside the whole world is constant, and if the「world」is a piece of isolatedmaterial, the energy is constant if there are no external forces. But as we haveseen, some of the kinetic and potential energy of a thing may be internal, forinstance the internal molecular motions, in the sense that we do not notice it.We know that in a glass of water everything is jiggling around, all the parts aremoving all the time, so there is a certain kinetic energy inside, which we ordinarilymay not pay any attention to. We do not notice the motion of the atoms, whichproduces heat, and so we do not call it kinetic energy, but heat is primarilykinetic energy. Internal potential energy may also be in the form, for instance, ofchemical energy: when we burn gasoline energy is liberated because the potentialenergies of the atoms in the new atomic arrangement are lower than in the oldarrangement. It is not strictly possible to treat heat as being pure kinetic energy,for a little of the potential gets in, and vice versa for chemical energy, so weput the two together and say that the total kinetic and potential energy insidean object is partly heat, partly chemical energy, and so on. Anyway, all thesediﬀerent forms of internal energy are sometimes considered as「lost」energy in thesense described above; this will be made clearer when we study thermodynamics.As another example, when friction is present it is not true that kinetic energyis lost, even though a sliding object stops and the kinetic energy seems to be lost.The kinetic energy is not lost because, of course, the atoms inside are jigglingwith a greater amount of kinetic energy than before, and although we cannotsee that, we can measure it by determining the temperature. Of course if wedisregard the heat energy, then the conservation of energy theorem will appearto be false.

14-11

Another situation in which energy conservation appears to be false is whenwe study only part of a system. Naturally, the conservation of energy theoremwill appear not to be true if something is interacting with something else on theoutside and we neglect to take that interaction into account.

In classical physics potential energy involved only gravitation and electricity,but now we have nuclear energy and other energies also. Light, for example,would involve a new form of energy in the classical theory, but we can also, if wewant to, imagine that the energy of light is the kinetic energy of a photon, andthen our formula (14.2) would still be right.

14-5 Potentials and ﬁeldsWe shall now discuss a few of the ideas associated with potential energy andwith the idea of a ﬁeld. Suppose we have two large objects A and B and athird very small one which is attracted gravitationally by the two, with someresultant force F . We have already noted in Chapter 12 that the gravitationalforce on a particle can be written as its mass, m, times another vector, C, whichis dependent only upon the position of the particle:

F = mC.

We can analyze gravitation, then, by imagining that there is a certain vector Cat every position in space which「acts」upon a mass which we may place there,but which is there itself whether we actually supply a mass for it to「act」onor not. C has three components, and each of those components is a functionof (x, y, z), a function of position in space. Such a thing we call a ﬁeld, and wesay that the objects A and B generate the ﬁeld, i.e., they「make」the vector C.When an object is put in a ﬁeld, the force on it is equal to its mass times thevalue of the ﬁeld vector at the point where the object is put.We can also do the same with the potential energy. Since the potentialenergy, the integral of (−force) · (ds) can be written as m times the integral of(−ﬁeld) · (ds), a mere change of scale, we see that the potential energy U(x, y, z)of an object located at a point (x, y, z) in space can be written as m times another

function which we may call the potential Ψ. The integralR C · ds = −Ψ, justasR F · ds = −U; there is only a scale factor between the two:

C · ds = mΨ.

(14.7)

Z

U = −

Z

F · ds = −m

14-12

By having this function Ψ(x, y, z) at every point in space, we can immedi-ately calculate the potential energy of an object at any point in space, namely,U(x, y, z) = mΨ(x, y, z)—rather a trivial business, it seems. But it is not reallytrivial, because it is sometimes much nicer to describe the ﬁeld by giving thevalue of Ψ everywhere in space instead of having to give C. Instead of having towrite three complicated components of a vector function, we can give instead thescalar function Ψ. Furthermore, it is much easier to calculate Ψ than any givencomponent of C when the ﬁeld is produced by a number of masses, for sincethe potential is a scalar we merely add, without worrying about direction. Also,the ﬁeld C can be recovered easily from Ψ, as we shall shortly see. Suppose wehave point masses m1, m2, . . . at the points 1, 2, . . . and we wish to know thepotential Ψ at some arbitrary point p. This is simply the sum of the potentialsat p due to the individual masses taken one by one:

Ψ(p) =X

i = 1, 2, . . .

(14.8)

In the last chapter we used this formula, that the potential is the sum ofthe potentials from all the diﬀerent objects, to calculate the potential due to aspherical shell of matter by adding the contributions to the potential at a pointfrom all parts of the shell. The result of this calculation is shown graphicallyin Fig. 14-4. It is negative, having the value zero at r = ∞ and varying as 1/rdown to the radius a, and then is constant inside the shell. Outside the shellthe potential is −Gm/r, where m is the mass of the shell, which is exactly thesame as it would have been if all the mass were located at the center. But it isnot everywhere exactly the same, for inside the shell the potential turns out tobe −Gm/a, and is a constant! When the potential is constant, there is no ﬁeld,or when the potential energy is constant there is no force, because if we move an

14-13

object from one place to another anywhere inside the sphere the work done bythe force is exactly zero. Why? Because the work done in moving the object fromone place to the other is equal to minus the change in the potential energy (or,the corresponding ﬁeld integral is the change of the potential). But the potentialenergy is the same at any two points inside, so there is zero change in potentialenergy, and therefore no work is done in going between any two points inside theshell. The only way the work can be zero for all directions of displacement isthat there is no force at all.

This gives us a clue as to how we can obtain the force or the ﬁeld, given thepotential energy. Let us suppose that the potential energy of an object is knownat the position (x, y, z) and we want to know what the force on the object is.It will not do to know the potential at only this one point, as we shall see; itrequires knowledge of the potential at neighboring points as well. Why? Howcan we calculate the x-component of the force? (If we can do this, of course, wecan also ﬁnd the y- and z-components, and we will then know the whole force.)Now, if we were to move the object a small distance ∆x, the work done by theforce on the object would be the x-component of the force times ∆x, if ∆x issuﬃciently small, and this should equal the change in potential energy in goingfrom one point to the other:

We have merely used the formulaR F · ds = −∆U, but for a very short path.

∆W = −∆U = Fx ∆x.

(14.9)

Now we divide by ∆x and so ﬁnd that the force is

Fx = −∆U/∆x.

(14.10)Of course this is not exact. What we really want is the limit of (14.10)as ∆x gets smaller and smaller, because it is only exactly right in the limit ofinﬁnitesimal ∆x. This we recognize as the derivative of U with respect to x,and we would be inclined, therefore, to write −dU/dx. But U depends on x, y,and z, and the mathematicians have invented a diﬀerent symbol to remind us tobe very careful when we are diﬀerentiating such a function, so as to rememberthat we are considering that only x varies, and y and z do not vary. Insteadof a d they simply make a「backwards 6,」or ∂. (A ∂ should have been usedin the beginning of calculus because we always want to cancel that d, but wenever want to cancel a ∂!) So they write ∂U/∂x, and furthermore, in moments ofduress, if they want to be very careful, they put a line beside it with a little yz

at the bottom (∂U/∂x|yz), which means「Take the derivative of U with respectto x, keeping y and z constant.」Most often we leave out the remark about whatis kept constant because it is usually evident from the context, so we usually donot use the line with the y and z. However, always use a ∂ instead of a d as awarning that it is a derivative with some other variables kept constant. This iscalled a partial derivative; it is a derivative in which we vary only x.derivative of U with respect to x:

Therefore, we ﬁnd that the force in the x-direction is minus the partial

(14.11)In a similar way, the force in the y-direction can be found by diﬀerentiating Uwith respect to y, keeping x and z constant, and the third component, of course,is the derivative with respect to z, keeping y and x constant:

Fx = −∂U/∂x.

Fy = −∂U/∂y,

Fz = −∂U/∂z.

Cx = −∂Ψ/∂x,

(14.12)This is the way to get from the potential energy to the force. We get the ﬁeldfrom the potential in exactly the same way:Cy = −∂Ψ/∂y,

(14.13)Incidentally, we shall mention here another notation, which we shall notactually use for quite a while: Since C is a vector and has x-, y-, and z-components,the symbolized ∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, and ∂/∂z which produce the x-, y-, and z-componentsare something like vectors. The mathematicians have invented a glorious newsymbol, ∇, called「grad」or「gradient」, which is not a quantity but an operatorthat makes a vector from a scalar. It has the following「components」: The x-component of this「grad」is ∂/∂x the y-component is ∂/∂y, and the z-componentis ∂/∂z, and then we have the fun of writing our formulas this way:

Cz = −∂Ψ/∂z.

F = −∇U,

C = −∇Ψ.

(14.14)Using ∇ gives us a quick way of testing whether we have a real vector equationor not, but actually Eqs. (14.14) mean precisely the same as Eqs. (14.11), (14.12)and (14.13); it is just another way of writing them, and since we do not want towrite three equations every time, we just write ∇U instead.One more example of ﬁelds and potentials has to do with the electrical case.In the case of electricity the force on a stationary object is the charge times the

electric ﬁeld: F = qE. (In general, of course, the x-component of force in anelectrical problem has also a part which depends on the magnetic ﬁeld. It is easyto show from Eq. (12.11) that the force on a particle due to magnetic ﬁelds isalways at right angles to its velocity, and also at right angles to the ﬁeld. Sincethe force due to magnetism on a moving charge is at right angles to the velocity,no work is done by the magnetism on the moving charge because the motion is atright angles to the force. Therefore, in calculating theorems of kinetic energy inelectric and magnetic ﬁelds we can disregard the contribution from the magneticﬁeld, since it does not change the kinetic energy.) We suppose that there is onlyan electric ﬁeld. Then we can calculate the energy, or work done, in the same wayas for gravity, and calculate a quantity φ which is minus the integral of E · ds,from the arbitrary ﬁxed point to the point where we make the calculation, andthen the potential energy in an electric ﬁeld is just charge times this quantity φ:

Let us take, as an example, the case of two parallel metal plates, each with asurface charge of ±σ per unit area. This is called a parallel-plate capacitor. Wefound previously that there is zero force outside the plates and that there is aconstant electric ﬁeld between them, directed from + to − and of magnitude σ/0(Fig. 14-5). We would like to know how much work would be done in carrying acharge from one plate to the other. The work would be the (force)· (ds) integral,which can be written as charge times the potential value at plate 1 minus that atplate 2:

We can actually work out the integral because the force is constant, and if we

The diﬀerence in potential, ∆φ = σd/0, is called the voltage diﬀerence, and φ ismeasured in volts. When we say a pair of plates is charged to a certain voltage,what we mean is that the diﬀerence in electrical potential of the two plates isso-and-so many volts. For a capacitor made of two parallel plates carrying asurface charge ±σ, the voltage, or diﬀerence in potential, of the pair of platesis σd/0.
