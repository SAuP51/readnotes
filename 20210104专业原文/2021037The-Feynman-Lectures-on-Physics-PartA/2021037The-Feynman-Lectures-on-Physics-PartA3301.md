Polarization

33-1 The electric vector of lightIn this chapter we shall consider those phenomena which depend on the factthat the electric ﬁeld that describes the light is a vector. In previous chapterswe have not been concerned with the direction of oscillation of the electric ﬁeld,except to note that the electric vector lies in a plane perpendicular to the directionof propagation. The particular direction in this plane has not concerned us. Wenow consider those phenomena whose central feature is the particular directionof oscillation of the electric ﬁeld.

In ideally monochromatic light, the electric ﬁeld must oscillate at a deﬁnitefrequency, but since the x-component and the y-component can oscillate indepen-dently at a deﬁnite frequency, we must ﬁrst consider the resultant eﬀect producedby superposing two independent oscillations at right angles to each other. Whatkind of electric ﬁeld is made up of an x-component and a y-component whichoscillate at the same frequency? If one adds to an x-vibration a certain amount ofy-vibration at the same phase, the result is a vibration in a new direction in thexy-plane. Figure 33-1 illustrates the superposition of diﬀerent amplitudes for thex-vibration and the y-vibration. But the resultants shown in Fig. 33-1 are notthe only possibilities; in all of these cases we have assumed that the x-vibrationand the y-vibration are in phase, but it does not have to be that way. It couldbe that the x-vibration and the y-vibration are out of phase.When the x-vibration and the y-vibration are not in phase, the electric ﬁeldvector moves around in an ellipse, and we can illustrate this in a familiar way. Ifwe hang a ball from a support by a long string, so that it can swing freely in ahorizontal plane, it will execute sinusoidal oscillations. If we imagine horizontalx- and y-coordinates with their origin at the rest position of the ball, the ballcan swing in either the x- or y-direction with the same pendulum frequency.By selecting the proper initial displacement and initial velocity, we can set the

ball in oscillation along either the x-axis or the y-axis, or along any straightline in the xy-plane. These motions of the ball are analogous to the oscillationsof the electric ﬁeld vector illustrated in Fig. 33-1. In each instance, since thex-vibrations and the y-vibrations reach their maxima and minima at the sametime, the x- and y-oscillations are in phase. But we know that the most generalmotion of the ball is motion in an ellipse, which corresponds to oscillations inwhich the x- and y-directions are not in the same phase. The superposition of x-and y-vibrations which are not in phase is illustrated in Fig. 33-2 for a varietyof angles between the phase of the x-vibration and that of the y-vibration. Thegeneral result is that the electric vector moves around an ellipse. The motion ina straight line is a particular case corresponding to a phase diﬀerence of zero (oran integral multiple of π); motion in a circle corresponds to equal amplitudeswith a phase diﬀerence of 90◦ (or any odd integral multiple of π/2).

In Fig. 33-2 we have labeled the electric ﬁeld vectors in the x- and y-directionswith complex numbers, which are a convenient representation in which to expressthe phase diﬀerence. Do not confuse the real and imaginary components of thecomplex electric vector in this notation with the x- and y-coordinates of the ﬁeld.The x- and y-coordinates plotted in Fig. 33-1 and Fig. 33-2 are actual electricﬁelds that we can measure. The real and imaginary components of a complex

electric ﬁeld vector are only a mathematical convenience and have no physicalsigniﬁcance.

Now for some terminology. Light is linearly polarized (sometimes calledplane polarized) when the electric ﬁeld oscillates on a straight line; Fig. 33-1illustrates linear polarization. When the end of the electric ﬁeld vector travels inan ellipse, the light is elliptically polarized. When the end of the electric ﬁeldvector travels around a circle, we have circular polarization. If the end of theelectric vector, when we look at it as the light comes straight toward us, goesaround in a counterclockwise direction, we call it right-hand circular polarization.Figure 33-2(g) illustrates right-hand circular polarization, and Fig. 33-2(c) shows

33-3

left-hand circular polarization. In both cases the light is coming out of the paper.Our convention for labeling left-hand and right-hand circular polarization isconsistent with that which is used today for all the other particles in physicswhich exhibit polarization (e.g., electrons). However, in some books on opticsthe opposite conventions are used, so one must be careful.

We have considered linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized light, whichcovers everything except for the case of unpolarized light. Now how can the lightbe unpolarized when we know that it must vibrate in one or another of theseellipses? If the light is not absolutely monochromatic, or if the x- and y-phasesare not kept perfectly together, so that the electric vector ﬁrst vibrates in onedirection, then in another, the polarization is constantly changing. Rememberthat one atom emits during 10−8 sec, and if one atom emits a certain polarization,and then another atom emits light with a diﬀerent polarization, the polarizationswill change every 10−8 sec. If the polarization changes more rapidly than wecan detect it, then we call the light unpolarized, because all the eﬀects of thepolarization average out. None of the interference eﬀects of polarization wouldshow up with unpolarized light. But as we see from the deﬁnition, light isunpolarized only if we are unable to ﬁnd out whether the light is polarized ornot.

33-2 Polarization of scattered lightThe ﬁrst example of the polarization eﬀect that we have already discussedis the scattering of light. Consider a beam of light, for example from the sun,shining on the air. The electric ﬁeld will produce oscillations of charges in theair, and motion of these charges will radiate light with its maximum intensityin a plane normal to the direction of vibration of the charges. The beam fromthe sun is unpolarized, so the direction of polarization changes constantly, andthe direction of vibration of the charges in the air changes constantly. If weconsider light scattered at 90◦, the vibration of the charged particles radiatesto the observer only when the vibration is perpendicular to the observer’s lineof sight, and then light will be polarized along the direction of vibration. Soscattering is an example of one means of producing polarization.

33-3 BirefringenceAnother interesting eﬀect of polarization is the fact that there are substancesfor which the index of refraction is diﬀerent for light linearly polarized in one

33-4

direction and linearly polarized in another. Suppose that we had some materialwhich consisted of long, nonspherical molecules, longer than they are wide, andsuppose that these molecules were arranged in the substance with their long axesparallel. Then what happens when the oscillating electric ﬁeld passes through thissubstance? Suppose that because of the structure of the molecule, the electronsin the substance respond more easily to oscillations in the direction parallel tothe axes of the molecules than they would respond if the electric ﬁeld tries topush them at right angles to the molecular axis. In this way we expect a diﬀerentresponse for polarization in one direction than for polarization at right angles tothat direction. Let us call the direction of the axes of the molecules the optic axis.When the polarization is in the direction of the optic axis the index of refractionis diﬀerent than it would be if the direction of polarization were at right anglesto it. Such a substance is called birefringent. It has two refrangibilities, i.e.,two indexes of refraction, depending on the direction of the polarization insidethe substance. What kind of a substance can be birefringent? In a birefringentsubstance there must be a certain amount of lining up, for one reason or another,of unsymmetrical molecules. Certainly a cubic crystal, which has the symmetry ofa cube, cannot be birefringent. But long needlelike crystals undoubtedly containmolecules that are asymmetric, and one observes this eﬀect very easily.

Let us see what eﬀects we would expect if we were to shine polarized lightthrough a plate of a birefringent substance. If the polarization is parallel tothe optic axis, the light will go through with one velocity; if the polarization isperpendicular to the axis, the light is transmitted with a diﬀerent velocity. Aninteresting situation arises when, say, light is linearly polarized at 45◦ to theoptic axis. Now the 45◦ polarization, we have already noticed, can be representedas a superposition of the x- and the y-polarizations of equal amplitude and inphase, as shown in Fig. 33-2(a). Since the x- and y-polarizations travel withdiﬀerent velocities, their phases change at a diﬀerent rate as the light passesthrough the substance. So, although at the start the x- and y-vibrations are inphase, inside the material the phase diﬀerence between x- and y-vibrations isproportional to the depth in the substance. As the light proceeds through thematerial the polarization changes as shown in the series of diagrams in Fig. 33-2.If the thickness of the plate is just right to introduce a 90◦ phase shift betweenthe x- and y-polarizations, as in Fig. 33-2(c), the light will come out circularlypolarized. Such a thickness is called a quarter-wave plate, because it introduces aquarter-cycle phase diﬀerence between the x- and the y-polarizations. If linearlypolarized light is sent through two quarter-wave plates, it will come out plane-

33-5

polarized again, but at right angles to the original direction, as we can see fromFig. 33-2(e).

One can easily illustrate this phenomenon with a piece of cellophane. Cello-phane is made of long, ﬁbrous molecules, and is not isotropic, since the ﬁberslie preferentially in a certain direction. To demonstrate birefringence we need abeam of linearly polarized light, and we can obtain this conveniently by passingunpolarized light through a sheet of polaroid. Polaroid, which we will discusslater in more detail, has the useful property that it transmits light that is linearlypolarized parallel to the axis of the polaroid with very little absorption, butlight polarized in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the polaroid is stronglyabsorbed. When we pass unpolarized light through a sheet of polaroid, only thatpart of the unpolarized beam which is vibrating parallel to the axis of the polaroidgets through, so that the transmitted beam is linearly polarized. This sameproperty of polaroid is also useful in detecting the direction of polarization of alinearly polarized beam, or in determining whether a beam is linearly polarized ornot. One simply passes the beam of light through the polaroid sheet and rotatesthe polaroid in the plane normal to the beam. If the beam is linearly polarized,it will not be transmitted through the sheet when the axis of the polaroid isnormal to the direction of polarization. The transmitted beam is only slightlyattenuated when the axis of the polaroid sheet is rotated through 90◦. If thetransmitted intensity is independent of the orientation of the polaroid, the beamis not linearly polarized.

To demonstrate the birefringence of cellophane, we use two sheets of polaroid,as shown in Fig. 33-3. The ﬁrst gives us a linearly polarized beam which we passthrough the cellophane and then through the second polaroid sheet, which servesto detect any eﬀect the cellophane may have had on the polarized light passing

Fig. 33-3. An experimental demonstration of the birefringence ofcellophane. The electric vectors in the light are indicated by the dot-ted lines. The pass axes of the polaroid sheets and optic axes of thecellophane are indicated by arrows. The incident beam is unpolarized.

33-6

through it. If we ﬁrst set the axes of the two polaroid sheets perpendicular to eachother and remove the cellophane, no light will be transmitted through the secondpolaroid. If we now introduce the cellophane between the two polaroid sheets, androtate the sheet about the beam axis, we observe that in general the cellophanemakes it possible for some light to pass through the second polaroid. However,there are two orientations of the cellophane sheet, at right angles to each other,which permit no light to pass through the second polaroid. These orientations inwhich linearly polarized light is transmitted through the cellophane with no eﬀecton the direction of polarization must be the directions parallel and perpendicularto the optic axis of the cellophane sheet.

We suppose that the light passes through the cellophane with two diﬀerentvelocities in these two diﬀerent orientations, but it is transmitted without changingthe direction of polarization. When the cellophane is turned halfway betweenthese two orientations, as shown in Fig. 33-3, we see that the light transmittedthrough the second polaroid is bright.

It just happens that ordinary cellophane used in commercial packaging isvery close to a half-wave thickness for most of the colors in white light. Sucha sheet will turn the axis of linearly polarized light through 90◦ if the incidentlinearly polarized beam makes an angle of 45◦ with the optic axis, so that thebeam emerging from the cellophane is then vibrating in the right direction topass through the second polaroid sheet.

If we use white light in our demonstration, the cellophane sheet will be of theproper half-wave thickness only for a particular component of the white light,and the transmitted beam will have the color of this component. The colortransmitted depends on the thickness of the cellophane sheet, and we can varythe eﬀective thickness of the cellophane by tilting it so that the light passesthrough the cellophane at an angle, consequently through a longer path in thecellophane. As the sheet is tilted the transmitted color changes. With cellophaneof diﬀerent thicknesses one can construct ﬁlters that will transmit diﬀerent colors.These ﬁlters have the interesting property that they transmit one color when thetwo polaroid sheets have their axes perpendicular, and the complementary colorwhen the axes of the two polaroid sheets are parallel.

Another interesting application of aligned molecules is quite practical. Certainplastics are composed of very long and complicated molecules all twisted together.When the plastic is solidiﬁed very carefully, the molecules are all twisted in a mass,so that there are as many aligned in one direction as another, and so the plasticis not particularly birefringent. Usually there are strains and stresses introduced

33-7

when the material is solidiﬁed, so the material is not perfectly homogeneous.However, if we apply tension to a piece of this plastic material, it is as if we werepulling a whole tangle of strings, and there will be more strings preferentiallyaligned parallel to the tension than in any other direction. So when a stress isapplied to certain plastics, they become birefringent, and one can see the eﬀectsof the birefringence by passing polarized light through the plastic. If we examinethe transmitted light through a polaroid sheet, patterns of light and dark fringeswill be observed (in color, if white light is used). The patterns move as stress isapplied to the sample, and by counting the fringes and seeing where most of themare, one can determine what the stress is. Engineers use this phenomenon as ameans of ﬁnding the stresses in odd-shaped pieces that are diﬃcult to calculate.Another interesting example of a way of obtaining birefringence is by meansof a liquid substance. Consider a liquid composed of long asymmetric moleculeswhich carry a plus or minus average charge near the ends of the molecule, so thatthe molecule is an electric dipole. In the collisions in the liquid the molecules willordinarily be randomly oriented, with as many molecules pointed in one directionas in another. If we apply an electric ﬁeld the molecules will tend to line up,and the moment they line up the liquid becomes birefringent. With two polaroidsheets and a transparent cell containing such a polar liquid, we can devise anarrangement with the property that light is transmitted only when the electricﬁeld is applied. So we have an electrical switch for light, which is called a Kerrcell. This eﬀect, that an electric ﬁeld can produce birefringence in certain liquids,is called the Kerr eﬀect.

33-4 PolarizersSo far we have considered substances in which the refractive index is diﬀerentfor light polarized in diﬀerent directions. Of very practical value are those crystalsand other substances in which not only the index, but also the coeﬃcient ofabsorption, is diﬀerent for light polarized in diﬀerent directions. By the samearguments which supported the idea of birefringence, it is understandable thatabsorption can vary with the direction in which the charges are forced to vibratein an anisotropic substance. Tourmaline is an old, famous example and polaroidis another. Polaroid consists of a thin layer of small crystals of herapathite (asalt of iodine and quinine), all aligned with their axes parallel. These crystalsabsorb light when the oscillations are in one direction, and they do not absorbappreciably when the oscillations are in the other direction.

33-8

Suppose that we send light into a polaroid sheet polarized linearly at anangle θ to the passing direction. What intensity will come through? This incidentlight can be resolved into a component perpendicular to the pass direction whichis proportional to sin θ, and a component along the pass direction which isproportional to cos θ. The amplitude which comes out of the polaroid is onlythe cosine θ part; the sin θ component is absorbed. The amplitude which passesthrough the polaroid is smaller than the amplitude which entered, by a factor cos θ.The energy which passes through the polaroid, i.e., the intensity of the light, isproportional to the square of cos θ. Cos2 θ, then, is the intensity transmittedwhen the light enters polarized at an angle θ to the pass direction. The absorbedintensity, of course, is sin2 θ.An interesting paradox is presented by the following situation. We know thatit is not possible to send a beam of light through two polaroid sheets with theiraxes crossed at right angles. But if we place a third polaroid sheet between theﬁrst two, with its pass axis at 45◦ to the crossed axes, some light is transmitted.We know that polaroid absorbs light, it does not create anything. Nevertheless,the addition of a third polaroid at 45◦ allows more light to get through. Theanalysis of this phenomenon is left as an exercise for the student.

One of the most interesting examples of polarization is not in complicatedcrystals or diﬃcult substances, but in one of the simplest and most familiar ofsituations—the reﬂection of light from a surface. Believe it or not, when light isreﬂected from a glass surface it may be polarized, and the physical explanation ofthis is very simple. It was discovered empirically by Brewster that light reﬂectedfrom a surface is completely polarized if the reﬂected beam and the beam refractedinto the material form a right angle. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 33-4. Ifthe incident beam is polarized in the plane of incidence, there will be no reﬂectionat all. Only if the incident beam is polarized normal to the plane of incidence willit be reﬂected. The reason is very easy to understand. In the reﬂecting materialthe light is polarized transversely, and we know that it is the motion of the chargesin the material which generates the emergent beam, which we call the reﬂectedbeam. The source of this so-called reﬂected light is not simply that the incidentbeam is reﬂected; our deeper understanding of this phenomenon tells us that theincident beam drives an oscillation of the charges in the material, which in turngenerates the reﬂected beam. From Fig. 33-4 it is clear that only oscillationsnormal to the paper can radiate in the direction of reﬂection, and consequently thereﬂected beam will be polarized normal to the plane of incidence. If the incidentbeam is polarized in the plane of incidence, there will be no reﬂected light.

33-9

This phenomenon is readily demonstrated by reﬂecting a linearly polarizedbeam from a ﬂat piece of glass. If the glass is turned to present diﬀerent anglesof incidence to the polarized beam, sharp attenuation of the reﬂected intensityis observed when the angle of incidence passes through Brewster’s angle. Thisattenuation is observed only if the plane of polarization lies in the plane ofincidence. If the plane of polarization is normal to the plane of incidence, theusual reﬂected intensity is observed at all angles.

33-5 Optical activityAnother most remarkable eﬀect of polarization is observed in materials com-posed of molecules which do not have reﬂection symmetry: molecules shapedsomething like a corkscrew, or like a gloved hand, or any shape which, if viewedthrough a mirror, would be reversed in the same way that a left-hand glovereﬂects as a right-hand glove. Suppose all of the molecules in the substance arethe same, i.e., none is a mirror image of any other. Such a substance may showan interesting eﬀect called optical activity, whereby as linearly polarized lightpasses through the substance, the direction of polarization rotates about thebeam axis.

To understand the phenomenon of optical activity requires some calculation,but we can see qualitatively how the eﬀect might come about, without actuallycarrying out the calculations. Consider an asymmetric molecule in the shapeof a spiral, as shown in Fig. 33-5. Molecules need not actually be shaped like acorkscrew in order to exhibit optical activity, but this is a simple shape which

33-10

Fig. 33-5. A molecule with a shape that is not symmetric whenreﬂected in a mirror. A beam of light, linearly polarized in the y-direction,falls on the molecule.

we shall take as a typical example of those that do not have reﬂection symmetry.When a light beam linearly polarized along the y-direction falls on this molecule,the electric ﬁeld will drive charges up and down the helix, thereby generatinga current in the y-direction and radiating an electric ﬁeld Ey polarized in they-direction. However, if the electrons are constrained to move along the spiral,they must also move in the x-direction as they are driven up and down. Whena current is ﬂowing up the spiral, it is also ﬂowing into the paper at z = z1and out of the paper at z = z1 + A, if A is the diameter of our molecular spiral.One might suppose that the current in the x-direction would produce no netradiation, since the currents are in opposite directions on opposite sides of thespiral. However, if we consider the x-components of the electric ﬁeld arrivingat z = z2, we see that the ﬁeld radiated by the current at z = z1 + A and theﬁeld radiated from z = z1 arrive at z2 separated in time by the amount A/c,and thus separated in phase by π + ωA/c. Since the phase diﬀerence is notexactly π, the two ﬁelds do not cancel exactly, and we are left with a smallx-component in the electric ﬁeld generated by the motion of the electrons in themolecule, whereas the driving electric ﬁeld had only a y-component. This smallx-component, added to the large y-component, produces a resultant ﬁeld that istilted slightly with respect to the y-axis, the original direction of polarization.As the light moves through the material, the direction of polarization rotatesabout the beam axis. By drawing a few examples and considering the currentsthat will be set in motion by an incident electric ﬁeld, one can convince himselfthat the existence of optical activity and the sign of the rotation are independentof the orientation of the molecules.

Corn syrup is a common substance which possesses optical activity. Thephenomenon is easily demonstrated with a polaroid sheet to produce a linearlypolarized beam, a transmission cell containing corn syrup, and a second polaroid

33-11

sheet to detect the rotation of the direction of polarization as the light passesthrough the corn syrup.

33-6 The intensity of reﬂected lightLet us now consider quantitatively the reﬂection coeﬃcient as a function ofangle. Figure 33-6(a) shows a beam of light striking a glass surface, where itis partly reﬂected and partly refracted into the glass. Let us suppose that theincident beam, of unit amplitude, is linearly polarized normal to the plane of thepaper. We will call the amplitude of the reﬂected wave b, and the amplitude ofthe refracted wave a. The refracted and reﬂected waves will, of course, be linearlypolarized, and the electric ﬁeld vectors of the incident, reﬂected, and refractedwaves are all parallel to each other. Figure 33-6(b) shows the same situation, butnow we suppose that the incident wave, of unit amplitude, is polarized in theplane of the paper. Now let us call the amplitude of the reﬂected and refractedwave B and A, respectively.

We wish to calculate how strong the reﬂection is in the two situations illus-trated in Fig. 33-6(a) and 33-6(b). We already know that when the angle betweenthe reﬂected beam and refracted beam is a right angle, there will be no reﬂectedwave in Fig. 33-6(b), but let us see if we cannot get a quantitative answer—anexact formula for B and b as a function of the angle of incidence, i.

The principle that we must understand is as follows. The currents that aregenerated in the glass produce two waves. First, they produce the reﬂected wave.

Fig. 33-6. An incident wave of unit amplitude is reﬂected and refractedat a glass surface. In (a) the incident wave is linearly polarized normalto the plane of the paper. In (b) the incident wave is linearly polarizedin the direction shown by the dashed arrows.

33-12

Moreover, we know that if there were no currents generated in the glass, theincident wave would continue straight into the glass. Remember that all thesources in the world make the net ﬁeld. The source of the incident light beamproduces a ﬁeld of unit amplitude, which would move into the glass along thedotted line in the ﬁgure. This ﬁeld is not observed, and therefore the currentsgenerated in the glass must produce a ﬁeld of amplitude −1, which moves alongthe dotted line. Using this fact, we will calculate the amplitude of the refractedwaves, a and A.

In Fig. 33-6(a) we see that the ﬁeld of amplitude b is radiated by the motionof charges inside the glass which are responding to a ﬁeld a inside the glass, andthat therefore b is proportional to a. We might suppose that since our two ﬁguresare exactly the same, except for the direction of polarization, the ratio B/Awould be the same as the ratio b/a. This is not quite true, however, because inFig. 33-6(b) the polarization directions are not all parallel to each other, as theyare in Fig. 33-6(a). It is only the component of A which is perpendicular to B,A cos (i + r), which is eﬀective in producing B. The correct expression for theproportionality is then

=

ba

B

A cos (i + r) .

(33.1)

Now we use a trick. We know that in both (a) and (b) of Fig. 33-6 the electricﬁeld in the glass must produce oscillations of the charges, which generate a ﬁeldof amplitude −1, polarized parallel to the incident beam, and moving in thedirection of the dotted line. But we see from part (b) of the ﬁgure that onlythe component of A that is normal to the dashed line has the right polarizationto produce this ﬁeld, whereas in Fig. 33-6(a) the full amplitude a is eﬀective,since the polarization of wave a is parallel to the polarization of the wave ofamplitude −1. Therefore we can write

A cos (i − r)

a

= −1−1 ,

(33.2)

since the two amplitudes on the left side of Eq. (33.2) each produce the wave ofamplitude −1.

(33.3)

Dividing Eq. (33.1) by Eq. (33.2), we obtain= cos (i + r)cos (i − r) ,

Bb

33-13

a result which we can check against what we already know. If we set (i+ r) = 90◦,Eq. (33.3) gives B = 0, as Brewster says it should be, so our results so far are atleast not obviously wrong.We have assumed unit amplitudes for the incident waves, so that |B|2/12 isthe reﬂection coeﬃcient for waves polarized in the plane of incidence, and |b|2/12is the reﬂection coeﬃcient for waves polarized normal to the plane of incidence.The ratio of these two reﬂection coeﬃcients is determined by Eq. (33.3).

Now we perform a miracle, and compute not just the ratio, but each coeﬃcient|B|2 and |b|2 individually! We know from the conservation of energy that theenergy in the refracted wave must be equal to the incident energy minus the energyin the reﬂected wave, 1 − |B|2 in one case, 1 − |b|2 in the other. Furthermore,the energy which passes into the glass in Fig. 33-6(b) is to the energy whichpasses into the glass in Fig. 33-6(a) as the ratio of the squares of the refractedamplitudes, |A|2/|a|2. One might ask whether we really know how to computethe energy inside the glass, because, after all, there are energies of motion of theatoms in addition to the energy in the electric ﬁeld. But it is obvious that all ofthe various contributions to the total energy will be proportional to the squareof the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld. Therefore we can write

1 − |B|21 − |b|2

= |A|2|a|2 .

(33.4)

We now substitute Eq. (33.2) to eliminate A/a from the expression above,

and express B in terms of b by means of Eq. (33.3):

1 − |b|2 cos2 (i + r)cos2 (i − r)1 − |b|2

=

1

cos2 (i − r) .

(33.5)

This equation contains only one unknown amplitude, b. Solving for |b|2, weobtain

(33.6)

(33.7)

and, with the aid of (33.3),

|b|2 = sin2 (i − r)sin2 (i + r)|B|2 = tan2 (i − r)tan2 (i + r) .

33-14

So we have found the reﬂection coeﬃcient |b|2 for an incident wave polarizedperpendicular to the plane of incidence, and also the reﬂection coeﬃcient |B|2for an incident wave polarized in the plane of incidence!It is possible to go on with arguments of this nature and deduce that b is real.To prove this, one must consider a case where light is coming from both sides ofthe glass surface at the same time, a situation not easy to arrange experimentally,but fun to analyze theoretically. If we analyze this general case, we can provethat b must be real, and therefore, in fact, that b = ± sin (i − r)/ sin (i + r). Itis even possible to determine the sign by considering the case of a very, verythin layer in which there is reﬂection from the front and from the back surfaces,and calculating how much light is reﬂected. We know how much light should bereﬂected by a thin layer, because we know how much current is generated, andwe have even worked out the ﬁelds produced by such currents.

One can show by these arguments that

b = −sin (i − r)sin (i + r) ,

B = −tan (i − r)tan (i + r) .

(33.8)

These expressions for the reﬂection coeﬃcients as a function of the angles ofincidence and refraction are called Fresnel’s reﬂection formulas.If we consider the limit as the angles i and r go to zero, we ﬁnd, for the caseof normal incidence, that B2 ≈ b2 ≈ (i− r)2/(i + r)2 for both polarizations, sincethe sines are practically equal to the angles, as are also the tangents. But weknow that sin i/ sin r = n, and when the angles are small, i/r ≈ n. It is thus easyto show that the coeﬃcient of reﬂection for normal incidence is

B2 = b2 = (n − 1)2(n + 1)2 .

It is interesting to ﬁnd out how much light is reﬂected at normal incidencefrom the surface of water, for example. For water, n is 4/3, so that the reﬂectioncoeﬃcient is (1/7)2 ≈ 2%. At normal incidence, only two percent of the light isreﬂected from the surface of water.

33-7 Anomalous refractionThe last polarization eﬀect we shall consider was actually one of the ﬁrst to bediscovered: anomalous refraction. Sailors visiting Iceland brought back to Europe

33-15

crystals of Iceland spar (CaCO3) which had the amusing property of makinganything seen through the crystal appear doubled, i.e., as two images. This cameto the attention of Huygens, and played an important role in the discovery ofpolarization. As is often the case, the phenomena which are discovered ﬁrst arethe hardest, ultimately, to explain. It is only after we understand a physicalconcept thoroughly that we can carefully select those phenomena which mostclearly and simply demonstrate the concept.

Fig. 33-7. The upper diagram shows the path of the ordinary raythrough a doubly refracting crystal. The extraordinary ray is shown inthe lower diagram. The optic axis lies in the plane of the paper.

Anomalous refraction is a particular case of the same birefringence that weconsidered earlier. Anomalous refraction comes about when the optic axis, thelong axis of our asymmetric molecules, is not parallel to the surface of the crystal.In Fig. 33-7 are drawn two pieces of birefringent material, with the optic axis asshown. In the upper ﬁgure, the incident beam falling on the material is linearlypolarized in a direction perpendicular to the optic axis of the material. Whenthis beam strikes the surface of the material, each point on the surface acts as asource of a wave which travels into the crystal with velocity v⊥, the velocity oflight in the crystal when the plane of polarization is normal to the optic axis.The wavefront is just the envelope or locus of all these little spherical waves, andthis wavefront moves straight through the crystal and out the other side. This is

just the ordinary behavior we would expect, and this ray is called the ordinaryray.In the lower ﬁgure the linearly polarized light falling on the crystal has itsdirection of polarization turned through 90◦, so that the optic axis lies in theplane of polarization. When we now consider the little waves originating at anypoint on the surface of the crystal, we see that they do not spread out as sphericalwaves. Light travelling along the optic axis travels with velocity v⊥ becausethe polarization is perpendicular to the optic axis, whereas the light travellingperpendicular to the optic axis travels with velocity vk because the polarizationis parallel to the optic axis. In a birefringent material vk 6= v⊥, and in the ﬁgurevk < v⊥. A more complete analysis will show that the waves spread out on thesurface of an ellipsoid, with the optic axis as major axis of the ellipsoid. Theenvelope of all these elliptical waves is the wavefront which proceeds throughthe crystal in the direction shown. Again, at the back surface the beam will bedeﬂected just as it was at the front surface, so that the light emerges parallelto the incident beam, but displaced from it. Clearly, this beam does not followSnell’s law, but goes in an extraordinary direction. It is therefore called theextraordinary ray.When an unpolarized beam strikes an anomalously refracting crystal, it isseparated into an ordinary ray, which travels straight through in the normalmanner, and an extraordinary ray which is displaced as it passes through thecrystal. These two emergent rays are linearly polarized at right angles to eachother. That this is true can be readily demonstrated with a sheet of polaroidto analyze the polarization of the emergent rays. We can also demonstrate thatour interpretation of this phenomenon is correct by sending linearly polarizedlight into the crystal. By properly orienting the direction of polarization of theincident beam, we can make this light go straight through without splitting, orwe can make it go through without splitting but with a displacement.

We have represented all the various polarization cases in Figs. 33-1 and 33-2as superpositions of two special polarization cases, namely x and y in variousamounts and phases. Other pairs could equally well have been used. Polarizationalong any two perpendicular axes x0, y0 inclined to x and y would serve as well [forexample, any polarization can be made up of superpositions of cases (a) and (e)of Fig. 33-2]. It is interesting, however, that this idea can be extended to othercases also. For example, any linear polarization can be made up by superposingsuitable amounts at suitable phases of right and left circular polarizations [cases(c) and (g) of Fig. 33-2], since two equal vectors rotating in opposite directions

add to give a single vector oscillating in a straight line (Fig. 33-8). If the phaseof one is shifted relative to the other, the line is inclined. Thus all the picturesof Fig. 33-1 could be labeled「the superposition of equal amounts of right andleft circularly polarized light at various relative phases.」As the left slips behindthe right in phase, the direction of the linear polarization changes. Thereforeoptically active materials are, in a sense, birefringent. Their properties can bedescribed by saying that they have diﬀerent indexes for right- and left-handcircularly polarized light. Superposition of right and left circularly polarized lightof diﬀerent intensities produces elliptically polarized light.

Circularly polarized light has another interesting property—it carries angularmomentum (about the direction of propagation). To illustrate this, suppose thatsuch light falls on an atom represented by a harmonic oscillator that can bedisplaced equally well in any direction in the plane xy. Then the x-displacement ofthe electron will respond to the Ex component of the ﬁeld, while the y-componentresponds, equally, to the equal Ey component of the ﬁeld but 90◦ behind in phase.That is, the responding electron goes around in a circle, with angular velocity ω,in response to the rotating electric ﬁeld of the light (Fig. 33-9). Depending onthe damping characteristics of the response of the oscillator, the direction of thedisplacement a of the electron, and the direction of the force qeE on it need notbe the same but they rotate around together. The E may have a component atright angles to a, so work is done on the system and a torque τ is exerted. Thework done per second is τ ω. Over a period of time T the energy absorbed is τ ωT,while τ T is the angular momentum delivered to the matter absorbing the energy.We see therefore that a beam of right circularly polarized light containing a total

energy E carries an angular momentum (with vector directed along the directionof propagation) E/ω. For when this beam is absorbed that angular momentum isdelivered to the absorber. Left-hand circular light carries angular momentum ofthe opposite sign, −E/ω.
