Characteristics of Force

12-1 What is a force?Although it is interesting and worth while to study the physical laws simplybecause they help us to understand and to use nature, one ought to stop everyonce in a while and think,「What do they really mean?」The meaning of anystatement is a subject that has interested and troubled philosophers from timeimmemorial, and the meaning of physical laws is even more interesting, becauseit is generally believed that these laws represent some kind of real knowledge.The meaning of knowledge is a deep problem in philosophy, and it is alwaysimportant to ask,「What does it mean?」

Let us ask,「What is the meaning of the physical laws of Newton, which wewrite as F = ma? What is the meaning of force, mass, and acceleration?」Well,we can intuitively sense the meaning of mass, and we can deﬁne acceleration ifwe know the meaning of position and time. We shall not discuss those meanings,but shall concentrate on the new concept of force. The answer is equally simple:「If a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it.」That is what Newton’s lawssay, so the most precise and beautiful deﬁnition of force imaginable might simplybe to say that force is the mass of an object times the acceleration. Suppose wehave a law which says that the conservation of momentum is valid if the sumof all the external forces is zero; then the question arises,「What does it mean,that the sum of all the external forces is zero?」A pleasant way to deﬁne thatstatement would be:「When the total momentum is a constant, then the sum ofthe external forces is zero.」There must be something wrong with that, because itis just not saying anything new. If we have discovered a fundamental law, whichasserts that the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration, and then deﬁnethe force to be the mass times the acceleration, we have found out nothing. Wecould also deﬁne force to mean that a moving object with no force acting on itcontinues to move with constant velocity in a straight line. If we then observe anobject not moving in a straight line with a constant velocity, we might say that

12-1

there is a force on it. Now such things certainly cannot be the content of physics,because they are deﬁnitions going in a circle. The Newtonian statement above,however, seems to be a most precise deﬁnition of force, and one that appeals tothe mathematician; nevertheless, it is completely useless, because no predictionwhatsoever can be made from a deﬁnition. One might sit in an armchair allday long and deﬁne words at will, but to ﬁnd out what happens when two ballspush against each other, or when a weight is hung on a spring, is another matteraltogether, because the way the bodies behave is something completely outsideany choice of deﬁnitions.For example, if we were to choose to say that an object left to itself keeps itsposition and does not move, then when we see something drifting, we could saythat must be due to a「gorce」—a gorce is the rate of change of position. Now wehave a wonderful new law, everything stands still except when a gorce is acting.You see, that would be analogous to the above deﬁnition of force, and it wouldcontain no information. The real content of Newton’s laws is this: that the forceis supposed to have some independent properties, in addition to the law F = ma;but the speciﬁc independent properties that the force has were not completelydescribed by Newton or by anybody else, and therefore the physical law F = ma isan incomplete law. It implies that if we study the mass times the acceleration andcall the product the force, i.e., if we study the characteristics of force as a programof interest, then we shall ﬁnd that forces have some simplicity; the law is a goodprogram for analyzing nature, it is a suggestion that the forces will be simple.Now the ﬁrst example of such forces was the complete law of gravitation,which was given by Newton, and in stating the law he answered the question,「What is the force?」If there were nothing but gravitation, then the combinationof this law and the force law (second law of motion) would be a complete theory,but there is much more than gravitation, and we want to use Newton’s laws inmany diﬀerent situations. Therefore in order to proceed we have to tell somethingabout the properties of force.

For example, in dealing with force the tacit assumption is always made thatthe force is equal to zero unless some physical body is present, that if we ﬁnd aforce that is not equal to zero we also ﬁnd something in the neighborhood that isa source of the force. This assumption is entirely diﬀerent from the case of the「gorce」that we introduced above. One of the most important characteristics offorce is that it has a material origin, and this is not just a deﬁnition.Newton also gave one rule about the force: that the forces between interactingbodies are equal and opposite—action equals reaction; that rule, it turns out,

12-2

is not exactly true. In fact, the law F = ma is not exactly true; if it were adeﬁnition we should have to say that it is always exactly true; but it is not.The student may object,「I do not like this imprecision, I should like to haveeverything deﬁned exactly; in fact, it says in some books that any science isan exact subject, in which everything is deﬁned.」If you insist upon a precisedeﬁnition of force, you will never get it! First, because Newton’s Second Law isnot exact, and second, because in order to understand physical laws you mustunderstand that they are all some kind of approximation.

Any simple idea is approximate; as an illustration, consider an object, . . . whatis an object? Philosophers are always saying,「Well, just take a chair for example.」The moment they say that, you know that they do not know what they are talkingabout any more. What is a chair? Well, a chair is a certain thing over there . . .certain?, how certain? The atoms are evaporating from it from time to time—notmany atoms, but a few—dirt falls on it and gets dissolved in the paint; so todeﬁne a chair precisely, to say exactly which atoms are chair, and which atoms areair, or which atoms are dirt, or which atoms are paint that belongs to the chair isimpossible. So the mass of a chair can be deﬁned only approximately. In the sameway, to deﬁne the mass of a single object is impossible, because there are not anysingle, left-alone objects in the world—every object is a mixture of a lot of things,so we can deal with it only as a series of approximations and idealizations.

The trick is the idealizations. To an excellent approximation of perhaps onepart in 1010, the number of atoms in the chair does not change in a minute, andif we are not too precise we may idealize the chair as a deﬁnite thing; in the sameway we shall learn about the characteristics of force, in an ideal fashion, if weare not too precise. One may be dissatisﬁed with the approximate view of naturethat physics tries to obtain (the attempt is always to increase the accuracy of theapproximation), and may prefer a mathematical deﬁnition; but mathematicaldeﬁnitions can never work in the real world. A mathematical deﬁnition will begood for mathematics, in which all the logic can be followed out completely, butthe physical world is complex, as we have indicated in a number of examples, suchas those of the ocean waves and a glass of wine. When we try to isolate pieces of it,to talk about one mass, the wine and the glass, how can we know which is which,when one dissolves in the other? The forces on a single thing already involveapproximation, and if we have a system of discourse about the real world, then thatsystem, at least for the present day, must involve approximations of some kind.This system is quite unlike the case of mathematics, in which everything canbe deﬁned, and then we do not know what we are talking about. In fact, the glory

12-3

of mathematics is that we do not have to say what we are talking about. The gloryis that the laws, the arguments, and the logic are independent of what「it」is. Ifwe have any other set of objects that obey the same system of axioms as Euclid’sgeometry, then if we make new deﬁnitions and follow them out with correct logic,all the consequences will be correct, and it makes no diﬀerence what the subjectwas. In nature, however, when we draw a line or establish a line by using a lightbeam and a theodolite, as we do in surveying, are we measuring a line in the senseof Euclid? No, we are making an approximation; the cross hair has some width,but a geometrical line has no width, and so, whether Euclidean geometry can beused for surveying or not is a physical question, not a mathematical question.However, from an experimental standpoint, not a mathematical standpoint, weneed to know whether the laws of Euclid apply to the kind of geometry that weuse in measuring land; so we make a hypothesis that it does, and it works prettywell; but it is not precise, because our surveying lines are not really geometricallines. Whether or not those lines of Euclid, which are really abstract, apply tothe lines of experience is a question for experience; it is not a question that canbe answered by sheer reason.

In the same way, we cannot just call F = ma a deﬁnition, deduce everythingpurely mathematically, and make mechanics a mathematical theory, when me-chanics is a description of nature. By establishing suitable postulates it is alwayspossible to make a system of mathematics, just as Euclid did, but we cannot makea mathematics of the world, because sooner or later we have to ﬁnd out whetherthe axioms are valid for the objects of nature. Thus we immediately get involvedwith these complicated and「dirty」objects of nature, but with approximationsever increasing in accuracy.

12-2 FrictionThe foregoing considerations show that a true understanding of Newton’s lawsrequires a discussion of forces, and it is the purpose of this chapter to introducesuch a discussion, as a kind of completion of Newton’s laws. We have alreadystudied the deﬁnitions of acceleration and related ideas, but now we have tostudy the properties of force, and this chapter, unlike the previous chapters, willnot be very precise, because forces are quite complicated.

To begin with a particular force, let us consider the drag on an airplane ﬂyingthrough the air. What is the law for that force? (Surely there is a law for everyforce, we must have a law!) One can hardly think that the law for that force will

12-4

be simple. Try to imagine what makes a drag on an airplane ﬂying through theair—the air rushing over the wings, the swirling in the back, the changes goingon around the fuselage, and many other complications, and you see that there isnot going to be a simple law. On the other hand, it is a remarkable fact that thedrag force on an airplane is approximately a constant times the square of thevelocity, or F ≈ cv2.Now what is the status of such a law, is it analogous to F = ma? Not atall, because in the ﬁrst place this law is an empirical thing that is obtainedroughly by tests in a wind tunnel. You say,「Well F = ma might be empiricaltoo.」That is not the reason that there is a diﬀerence. The diﬀerence is not thatit is empirical, but that, as we understand nature, this law is the result of anenormous complexity of events and is not, fundamentally, a simple thing. Ifwe continue to study it more and more, measuring more and more accurately,the law will continue to become more complicated, not less. In other words, aswe study this law of the drag on an airplane more and more closely, we ﬁndout that it is「falser」and「falser,」and the more deeply we study it, and themore accurately we measure, the more complicated the truth becomes; so in thatsense we consider it not to result from a simple, fundamental process, whichagrees with our original surmise. For example, if the velocity is extremely low,so low that an ordinary airplane is not ﬂying, as when the airplane is draggedslowly through the air, then the law changes, and the drag friction depends morenearly linearly on the velocity. To take another example, the frictional drag ona ball or a bubble or anything that is moving slowly through a viscous liquidlike honey, is proportional to the velocity, but for motion so fast that the ﬂuidswirls around (honey does not but water and air do) then the drag becomes morenearly proportional to the square of the velocity (F = cv2), and if the velocitycontinues to increase, then even this law begins to fail. People who say,「Wellthe coeﬃcient changes slightly,」are dodging the issue. Second, there are othergreat complications: can this force on the airplane be divided or analyzed as aforce on the wings, a force on the front, and so on? Indeed, this can be done,if we are concerned about the torques here and there, but then we have to getspecial laws for the force on the wings, and so on. It is an amazing fact thatthe force on a wing depends upon the other wing: in other words, if we takethe airplane apart and put just one wing in the air, then the force is not thesame as if the rest of the plane were there. The reason, of course, is that someof the wind that hits the front goes around to the wings and changes the forceon the wings. It seems a miracle that there is such a simple, rough, empirical

12-5

law that can be used in the design of airplanes, but this law is not in the sameclass as the basic laws of physics, and further study of it will only make it moreand more complicated. A study of how the coeﬃcient c depends on the shapeof the front of the airplane is, to put it mildly, frustrating. There just is nosimple law for determining the coeﬃcient in terms of the shape of the airplane.In contrast, the law of gravitation is simple, and further study only indicates itsgreater simplicity.

We have just discussed two cases of friction, resulting from fast movement inair and slow movement in honey. There is another kind of friction, called dryfriction or sliding friction, which occurs when one solid body slides on another.In this case a force is needed to maintain motion. This is called a frictional force,and its origin, also, is a very complicated matter. Both surfaces of contact areirregular, on an atomic level. There are many points of contact where the atomsseem to cling together, and then, as the sliding body is pulled along, the atomssnap apart and vibration ensues; something like that has to happen. Formerlythe mechanism of this friction was thought to be very simple, that the surfaceswere merely full of irregularities and the friction originated in lifting the sliderover the bumps; but this cannot be, for there is no loss of energy in that process,whereas power is in fact consumed. The mechanism of power loss is that asthe slider snaps over the bumps, the bumps deform and then generate wavesand atomic motions and, after a while, heat, in the two bodies. Now it is veryremarkable that again, empirically, this friction can be described approximatelyby a simple law. This law is that the force needed to overcome friction and todrag one object over another depends upon the normal force (i.e., perpendicularto the surface) between the two surfaces that are in contact. Actually, to a fairlygood approximation, the frictional force is proportional to this normal force, andhas a more or less constant coeﬃcient; that is,

F = µN,

(12.1)where µ is called the coeﬃcient of friction (Fig. 12-1). Although this coeﬃcientis not exactly constant, the formula is a good empirical rule for judging approxi-mately the amount of force that will be needed in certain practical or engineeringcircumstances. If the normal force or the speed of motion gets too big, the lawfails because of the excessive heat generated. It is important to realize that eachof these empirical laws has its limitations, beyond which it does not really work.That the formula F = µN is approximately correct can be demonstrated bya simple experiment. We set up a plane, inclined at a small angle θ, and place a

12-6

for sliding contact.

block of weight W on the plane. We then tilt the plane at a steeper angle, untilthe block just begins to slide from its own weight. The component of the weightdownward along the plane is W sin θ, and this must equal the frictional force Fwhen the block is sliding uniformly. The component of the weight normal to theplane is W cos θ, and this is the normal force N. With these values, the formulabecomes W sin θ = µW cos θ, from which we get µ = sin θ/ cos θ = tan θ. If thislaw were exactly true, an object would start to slide at some deﬁnite inclination.If the same block is loaded by putting extra weight on it, then, although W isincreased, all the forces in the formula are increased in the same proportion,and W cancels out. If µ stays constant, the loaded block will slide again at thesame slope. When the angle θ is determined by trial with the original weight, itis found that with the greater weight the block will slide at about the same angle.This will be true even when one weight is many times as great as the other, andso we conclude that the coeﬃcient of friction is independent of the weight.

In performing this experiment it is noticeable that when the plane is tiltedat about the correct angle θ, the block does not slide steadily but in a haltingfashion. At one place it may stop, at another it may move with acceleration. Thisbehavior indicates that the coeﬃcient of friction is only roughly a constant, andvaries from place to place along the plane. The same erratic behavior is observedwhether the block is loaded or not. Such variations are caused by diﬀerent degreesof smoothness or hardness of the plane, and perhaps dirt, oxides, or other foreignmatter. The tables that list purported values of µ for「steel on steel,」「copperon copper,」and the like, are all false, because they ignore the factors mentionedabove, which really determine µ. The friction is never due to「copper on copper,」etc., but to the impurities clinging to the copper.

In experiments of the type described above, the friction is nearly independentof the velocity. Many people believe that the friction to be overcome to get

12-7

something started (static friction) exceeds the force required to keep it sliding(sliding friction), but with dry metals it is very hard to show any diﬀerence. Theopinion probably arises from experiences where small bits of oil or lubricant arepresent, or where blocks, for example, are supported by springs or other ﬂexiblesupports so that they appear to bind.

It is quite diﬃcult to do accurate quantitative experiments in friction, andthe laws of friction are still not analyzed very well, in spite of the enormousengineering value of an accurate analysis. Although the law F = µN is fairlyaccurate once the surfaces are standardized, the reason for this form of the lawis not really understood. To show that the coeﬃcient µ is nearly independent ofvelocity requires some delicate experimentation, because the apparent friction ismuch reduced if the lower surface vibrates very fast. When the experiment is doneat very high speed, care must be taken that the objects do not vibrate relativeto one another, since apparent decreases of the friction at high speed are oftendue to vibrations. At any rate, this friction law is another of those semiempiricallaws that are not thoroughly understood, and in view of all the work that hasbeen done it is surprising that more understanding of this phenomenon has notcome about. At the present time, in fact, it is impossible even to estimate thecoeﬃcient of friction between two substances.

It was pointed out above that attempts to measure µ by sliding pure substancessuch as copper on copper will lead to spurious results, because the surfaces incontact are not pure copper, but are mixtures of oxides and other impurities. Ifwe try to get absolutely pure copper, if we clean and polish the surfaces, outgasthe materials in a vacuum, and take every conceivable precaution, we still donot get µ. For if we tilt the apparatus even to a vertical position, the slider willnot fall oﬀ—the two pieces of copper stick together! The coeﬃcient µ, which isordinarily less than unity for reasonably hard surfaces, becomes several timesunity! The reason for this unexpected behavior is that when the atoms in contactare all of the same kind, there is no way for the atoms to「know」that they are indiﬀerent pieces of copper. When there are other atoms, in the oxides and greasesand more complicated thin surface layers of contaminants in between, the atoms「know」when they are not on the same part. When we consider that it is forcesbetween atoms that hold the copper together as a solid, it should become clearthat it is impossible to get the right coeﬃcient of friction for pure metals.

The same phenomenon can be observed in a simple home-made experimentwith a ﬂat glass plate and a glass tumbler. If the tumbler is placed on the plateand pulled along with a loop of string, it slides fairly well and one can feel the

12-8

coeﬃcient of friction; it is a little irregular, but it is a coeﬃcient. If we now wetthe glass plate and the bottom of the tumbler and pull again, we ﬁnd that itbinds, and if we look closely we shall ﬁnd scratches, because the water is ableto lift the grease and the other contaminants oﬀ the surface, and then we reallyhave a glass-to-glass contact; this contact is so good that it holds tight and resistsseparation so much that the glass is torn apart; that is, it makes scratches.

12-3 Molecular forcesWe shall next discuss the characteristics of molecular forces. These are forcesbetween the atoms, and are the ultimate origin of friction. Molecular forces havenever been satisfactorily explained on a basis of classical physics; it takes quantummechanics to understand them fully. Empirically, however, the force betweenatoms is illustrated schematically in Fig. 12-2, where the force F between twoatoms is plotted as a function of the distance r between them. There are diﬀerentcases: in the water molecule, for example, the negative charges sit more on theoxygen, and the mean positions of the negative charges and of the positive chargesare not at the same point; consequently, another molecule nearby feels a relativelylarge force, which is called a dipole-dipole force. However, for many systems thecharges are very much better balanced, in particular for oxygen gas, which isperfectly symmetrical. In this case, although the minus charges and the pluscharges are dispersed over the molecule, the distribution is such that the centerof the minus charges and the center of the plus charges coincide. A moleculewhere the centers do not coincide is called a polar molecule, and charge timesthe separation between centers is called the dipole moment. A nonpolar molecule

of separation.

12-9

is one in which the centers of the charges coincide. For all nonpolar molecules, inwhich all the electrical forces are neutralized, it nevertheless turns out that theforce at very large distances is an attraction and varies inversely as the seventhpower of the distance, or F = k/r7, where k is a constant that depends on themolecules. Why this is we shall learn only when we learn quantum mechanics.When there are dipoles the forces are greater. When atoms or molecules get tooclose they repel with a very large repulsion; that is what keeps us from fallingthrough the ﬂoor!

These molecular forces can be demonstrated in a fairly direct way: one ofthese is the friction experiment with a sliding glass tumbler; another is to taketwo very carefully ground and lapped surfaces which are very accurately ﬂat,so that the surfaces can be brought very close together. An example of suchsurfaces is the Johansson blocks that are used in machine shops as standards formaking accurate length measurements. If one such block is slid over another verycarefully and the upper one is lifted, the other one will adhere and also be liftedby the molecular forces, exemplifying the direct attraction between the atoms onone block for the atoms on the other block.

Nevertheless these molecular forces of attraction are still not fundamental inthe sense that gravitation is fundamental; they are due to the vastly complexinteractions of all the electrons and nuclei in one molecule with all the electronsand nuclei in another. Any simple-looking formula we get represents a summationof complications, so we still have not got the fundamental phenomena.

Since the molecular forces attract at large distances and repel at short distances,as shown in Fig. 12-2, we can make up solids in which all the atoms are heldtogether by their attractions and held apart by the repulsion that sets in whenthey are too close together. At a certain distance d (where the graph in Fig. 12-2crosses the axis) the forces are zero, which means that they are all balanced, sothat the molecules stay that distance apart from one another. If the molecules arepushed closer together than the distance d they all show a repulsion, representedby the portion of the graph above the r-axis. To push the molecules only slightlycloser together requires a great force, because the molecular repulsion rapidlybecomes very great at distances less than d. If the molecules are pulled slightlyapart there is a slight attraction, which increases as the separation increases. Ifthey are pulled suﬃciently hard, they will separate permanently—the bond isbroken.

If the molecules are pushed only a very small distance closer, or pulled onlya very small distance farther than d, the corresponding distance along the curve

12-10

of Fig. 12-2 is also very small, and can then be approximated by a straight line.Therefore, in many circumstances, if the displacement is not too great the forceis proportional to the displacement. This principle is known as Hooke’s law, orthe law of elasticity, which says that the force in a body which tries to restore thebody to its original condition when it is distorted is proportional to the distortion.This law, of course, holds true only if the distortion is relatively small; when itgets too large the body will be torn apart or crushed, depending on the kind ofdistortion. The amount of force for which Hooke’s law is valid depends uponthe material; for instance, for dough or putty the force is very small, but forsteel it is relatively large. Hooke’s law can be nicely demonstrated with a longcoil spring, made of steel and suspended vertically. A suitable weight hung onthe lower end of the spring produces a tiny twist throughout the length of thewire, which results in a small vertical deﬂection in each turn and adds up to alarge displacement if there are many turns. If the total elongation produced,say, by a 100-gram weight, is measured, it is found that additional weights of100 grams will each produce an additional elongation that is very nearly equalto the stretch that was measured for the ﬁrst 100 grams. This constant ratioof force to displacement begins to change when the spring is overloaded, i.e.,Hooke’s law no longer holds.

12-4 Fundamental forces. FieldsWe shall now discuss the only remaining forces that are fundamental. Wecall them fundamental in the sense that their laws are fundamentally simple. Weshall ﬁrst discuss electrical force. Objects carry electrical charges which consistsimply of electrons or protons. If any two bodies are electrically charged, thereis an electrical force between them, and if the magnitudes of the charges areq1 and q2, respectively, the force varies inversely as the square of the distancebetween the charges, or F = (const)q1q2/r2. For unlike charges, this law is likethe law of gravitation, but for like charges the force is repulsive and the sign(direction) is reversed. The charges q1 and q2 can be intrinsically either positiveor negative, and in any speciﬁc application of the formula the direction of theforce will come out right if the q’s are given the proper plus or minus sign; theforce is directed along the line between the two charges. The constant in theformula depends, of course, upon what units are used for the force, the charge,and the distance. In current practice the charge is measured in coulombs, thedistance in meters, and the force in newtons. Then, in order to get the force

12-11

to come out properly in newtons, the constant (which for historical reasons iswritten 1/4π0) takes the numerical value

or

0 = 8.854 × 10−12 coul2/newton · m2

1/4π0 = 8.99 × 109 N · m2/coul2.

Thus the force law for static charges is

F = q1q2r/4π0r3.

(12.2)In nature, the most important charge of all is the charge on a single elec-tron, which is 1.60 × 10−19 coulomb. In working with electrical forces betweenfundamental particles rather than with large charges, many people prefer thecombination (qel)2/4π0, in which qel is deﬁned as the charge on an electron. Thiscombination occurs frequently, and to simplify calculations it has been deﬁnedby the symbol e2; its numerical value in the mks system of units turns out tobe (1.52 × 10−14)2. The advantage of using the constant in this form is that theforce between two electrons in newtons can then be written simply as e2/r2, withr in meters, without all the individual constants. Electrical forces are much morecomplicated than this simple formula indicates, since the formula gives the forcebetween two objects only when the objects are standing still. We shall considerthe more general case shortly.

In the analysis of forces of the more fundamental kinds (not such forces asfriction, but the electrical force or the gravitational force), an interesting and veryimportant concept has been developed. Since at ﬁrst sight the forces are verymuch more complicated than is indicated by the inverse-square laws and theselaws hold true only when the interacting bodies are standing still, an improvedmethod is needed to deal with the very complex forces that ensue when the bodiesstart to move in a complicated way. Experience has shown that an approachknown as the concept of a「ﬁeld」is of great utility for the analysis of forces ofthis type. To illustrate the idea for, say, electrical force, suppose we have twoelectrical charges, q1 and q2, located at points P and R respectively. Then theforce between the charges is given by

(12.3)To analyze this force by means of the ﬁeld concept, we say that the charge q1at P produces a「condition」at R, such that when the charge q2 is placed at R

F = q1q2r/4π0r3.

12-12

it「feels」the force. This is one way, strange perhaps, of describing it; we saythat the force F on q2 at R can be written in two parts. It is q2 multiplied by aquantity E that would be there whether q2 were there or not (provided we keepall the other charges in their right places). E is the「condition」produced by q1,we say, and F is the response of q2 to E. E is called an electric ﬁeld, and it is avector. The formula for the electric ﬁeld E that is produced at R by a charge q1at P is the charge q1 times the constant 1/4π0 divided by r2 (r is the distancefrom P to R), and it is acting in the direction of the radius vector (the radiusvector r divided by its own length). The expression for E is thus

We then write

E = q1r/4π0r3.

(12.4)

F = q2 E,

(12.5)which expresses the force, the ﬁeld, and the charge in the ﬁeld. What is the pointof all this? The point is to divide the analysis into two parts. One part says thatsomething produces a ﬁeld. The other part says that something is acted on bythe ﬁeld. By allowing us to look at the two parts independently, this separationof the analysis simpliﬁes the calculation of a problem in many situations. If manycharges are present, we ﬁrst work out the total electric ﬁeld produced at R by allthe charges, and then, knowing the charge that is placed at R, we ﬁnd the forceon it.In the case of gravitation, we can do exactly the same thing. In this case,where the force F = −Gm1m2r/r3, we can make an analogous analysis, asfollows: the force on a body in a gravitational ﬁeld is the mass of that bodytimes the ﬁeld C. The force on m2 is the mass m2 times the ﬁeld C producedby m1; that is, F = m2C. Then the ﬁeld C produced by a body of mass m1is C = −Gm1r/r3 and it is directed radially, as in the electrical case.In spite of how it might at ﬁrst seem, this separation of one part from anotheris not a triviality. It would be trivial, just another way of writing the samething, if the laws of force were simple, but the laws of force are so complicatedthat it turns out that the ﬁelds have a reality that is almost independent ofthe objects which create them. One can do something like shake a charge andproduce an eﬀect, a ﬁeld, at a distance; if one then stops moving the charge, theﬁeld keeps track of all the past, because the interaction between two particles isnot instantaneous. It is desirable to have some way to remember what happenedpreviously. If the force upon some charge depends upon where another charge

12-13

was yesterday, which it does, then we need machinery to keep track of what wenton yesterday, and that is the character of a ﬁeld. So when the forces get morecomplicated, the ﬁeld becomes more and more real, and this technique becomesless and less of an artiﬁcial separation.

In analyzing forces by the use of ﬁelds, we need two kinds of laws pertainingto ﬁelds. The ﬁrst is the response to a ﬁeld, and that gives the equations ofmotion. For example, the law of response of a mass to a gravitational ﬁeld isthat the force is equal to the mass times the gravitational ﬁeld; or, if there isalso a charge on the body, the response of the charge to the electric ﬁeld equalsthe charge times the electric ﬁeld. The second part of the analysis of nature inthese situations is to formulate the laws which determine the strength of theﬁeld and how it is produced. These laws are sometimes called the ﬁeld equations.We shall learn more about them in due time, but shall write down a few thingsabout them now.

First, the most remarkable fact of all, which is true exactly and which can beeasily understood, is that the total electric ﬁeld produced by a number of sourcesis the vector sum of the electric ﬁelds produced by the ﬁrst source, the secondsource, and so on. In other words, if we have numerous charges making a ﬁeld,and if all by itself one of them would make the ﬁeld E1, another would make theﬁeld E2, and so on, then we merely add the vectors to get the total ﬁeld. Thisprinciple can be expressed as

Can the same methods be applied to gravitation? The force between twomasses m1 and m2 was expressed by Newton as F = −Gm1m2r/r3. Butaccording to the ﬁeld concept, we may say that m1 creates a ﬁeld C in all thesurrounding space, such that the force on m2 is given by

F = m2C.By complete analogy with the electrical case,

Ci = −Gmiri/r3

and the gravitational ﬁeld produced by several masses is

C = C1 + C2 + C3 + ···

(12.10)

In Chapter 9, in working out a case of planetary motion, we used this principlein essence. We simply added all the force vectors to get the resultant force on aplanet. If we divide out the mass of the planet in question, we get Eq. (12.10).Equations (12.6) and (12.10) express what is known as the principle ofsuperposition of ﬁelds. This principle states that the total ﬁeld due to all thesources is the sum of the ﬁelds due to each source. So far as we know today,for electricity this is an absolutely guaranteed law, which is true even whenthe force law is complicated because of the motions of the charges. There areapparent violations, but more careful analysis has always shown these to be dueto the overlooking of certain moving charges. However, although the principle ofsuperposition applies exactly for electrical forces, it is not exact for gravity if theﬁeld is too strong, and Newton’s equation (12.10) is only approximate, accordingto Einstein’s gravitational theory.

Closely related to electrical force is another kind, called magnetic force, andthis too is analyzed in terms of a ﬁeld. Some of the qualitative relations betweenelectrical and magnetic forces can be illustrated by an experiment with an electron-ray tube (Fig. 12-3). At one end of such a tube is a source that emits a streamof electrons. Within the tube are arrangements for accelerating the electrons toa high speed and sending some of them in a narrow beam to a ﬂuorescent screenat the other end of the tube. A spot of light glows in the center of the screenwhere the electrons strike, and this enables us to trace the electron path. On the

12-15

way to the screen the electron beam passes through a narrow space between apair of parallel metal plates, which are arranged, say, horizontally. A voltage canbe applied across the plates, so that either plate can be made negative at will.When such a voltage is present, there is an electric ﬁeld between the plates.

The ﬁrst part of the experiment is to apply a negative voltage to the lowerplate, which means that extra electrons have been placed on the lower plate.Since like charges repel, the light spot on the screen instantly shifts upward.(We could also say this in another way—that the electrons「felt」the ﬁeld, andresponded by deﬂecting upward.) We next reverse the voltage, making the upperplate negative. The light spot on the screen now jumps below the center, showingthat the electrons in the beam were repelled by those in the plate above them.(Or we could say again that the electrons had「responded」to the ﬁeld, which isnow in the reverse direction.)

The second part of the experiment is to disconnect the voltage from the platesand test the eﬀect of a magnetic ﬁeld on the electron beam. This is done by meansof a horseshoe magnet, whose poles are far enough apart to more or less straddlethe tube. Suppose we hold the magnet below the tube in the same orientationas the letter U, with its poles up and part of the tube in between. We note thatthe light spot is deﬂected, say, upward, as the magnet approaches the tube frombelow. So it appears that the magnet repels the electron beam. However, it is notthat simple, for if we invert the magnet without reversing the poles side-for-side,and now approach the tube from above, the spot still moves upward, so theelectron beam is not repelled; instead, it appears to be attracted this time. Nowwe start again, restoring the magnet to its original U orientation and holdingit below the tube, as before. Yes, the spot is still deﬂected upward; but now turnthe magnet 180 degrees around a vertical axis, so that it is still in the U positionbut the poles are reversed side-for-side. Behold, the spot now jumps downward,and stays down, even if we invert the magnet and approach from above, as before.To understand this peculiar behavior, we have to have a new combination offorces. We explain it thus: Across the magnet from one pole to the other there is amagnetic ﬁeld. This ﬁeld has a direction which is always away from one particularpole (which we could mark) and toward the other. Inverting the magnet didnot change the direction of the ﬁeld, but reversing the poles side-for-side didreverse its direction. For example, if the electron velocity were horizontal in thex-direction and the magnetic ﬁeld were also horizontal but in the y-direction, themagnetic force on the moving electrons would be in the z-direction, i.e., up ordown, depending on whether the ﬁeld was in the positive or negative y-direction.

12-16

Although we shall not at the present time give the correct law of force betweencharges moving in an arbitrary manner, one relative to the other, because it istoo complicated, we shall give one aspect of it: the complete law of the forcesif the ﬁelds are known. The force on a charged object depends upon its motion;if, when the object is standing still at a given place, there is some force, thisis taken to be proportional to the charge, the coeﬃcient being what we callthe electric ﬁeld. When the object moves the force may be diﬀerent, and thecorrection, the new「piece」of force, turns out to be dependent exactly linearlyon the velocity, but at right angles to v and to another vector quantity which wecall the magnetic induction B. If the components of the electric ﬁeld E and themagnetic induction B are, respectively, (Ex, Ey, Ez) and (Bx, By, Bz), and if thevelocity v has the components (vx, vy, vz), then the total electric and magneticforce on a moving charge q has the components

Fx = q(Ex + vyBz − vz By),Fy = q(Ey + vz Bx − vxBz),Fz = q(Ez + vxBy − vyBx).

(12.11)

If, for instance, the only component of the magnetic ﬁeld were By and the onlycomponent of the velocity were vx, then the only term left in the magnetic forcewould be a force in the z-direction, at right angles to both B and v.

12-5 Pseudo forcesThe next kind of force we shall discuss might be called a pseudo force. InChapter 11 we discussed the relationship between two people, Joe and Moe, whouse diﬀerent coordinate systems. Let us suppose that the positions of a particleas measured by Joe are x and by Moe are x0; then the laws are as follows:

x = x0 + s,

y = y0,

z = z0,

where s is the displacement of Moe’s system relative to Joe’s. If we suppose thatthe laws of motion are correct for Joe, how do they look for Moe? We ﬁnd ﬁrst,that

dx/dt = dx0/dt + ds/dt.

Previously, we considered the case where s was constant, and we found that smade no diﬀerence in the laws of motion, since ds/dt = 0; ultimately, therefore,

12-17

the laws of physics were the same in both systems. But another case we cantake is that s = ut, where u is a uniform velocity in a straight line. Thens is not constant, and ds/dt is not zero, but is u, a constant. However, theacceleration d2x/dt2 is still the same as d2x0/dt2, because du/dt = 0. This provesthe law that we used in Chapter 10, namely, that if we move in a straight linewith uniform velocity the laws of physics will look the same to us as when we arestanding still. That is the Galilean transformation. But we wish to discuss theinteresting case where s is still more complicated, say s = at2/2. Then ds/dt = atand d2s/dt2 = a, a uniform acceleration; or in a still more complicated case, theacceleration might be a function of time. This means that although the laws ofmotion from the point of view of Joe would look like

the laws of motion as looked upon by Moe would appear as

d2xdt2

m

= Fx,

d2x0dt2

m

= Fx0 = Fx − ma.

That is, since Moe’s coordinate system is accelerating with respect to Joe’s, theextra term ma comes in, and Moe will have to correct his forces by that amountin order to get Newton’s laws to work. In other words, here is an apparent,mysterious new force of unknown origin which arises, of course, because Moehas the wrong coordinate system. This is an example of a pseudo force; otherexamples occur in coordinate systems that are rotating.

Another example of pseudo force is what is often called「centrifugal force.」An observer in a rotating coordinate system, e.g., in a rotating box, will ﬁndmysterious forces, not accounted for by any known origin of force, throwingthings outward toward the walls. These forces are due merely to the fact thatthe observer does not have Newton’s coordinate system, which is the simplestcoordinate system.

Pseudo force can be illustrated by an interesting experiment in which wepush a jar of water along a table, with acceleration. Gravity, of course, actsdownward on the water, but because of the horizontal acceleration there is also apseudo force acting horizontally and in a direction opposite to the acceleration.The resultant of gravity and pseudo force makes an angle with the vertical, andduring the acceleration the surface of the water will be perpendicular to the

12-18

resultant force, i.e., inclined at an angle with the table, with the water standinghigher in the rearward side of the jar. When the push on the jar stops and thejar decelerates because of friction, the pseudo force is reversed, and the waterstands higher in the forward side of the jar (Fig. 12-4).

Fig. 12-4. Illustration of a pseudo force.

One very important feature of pseudo forces is that they are always propor-tional to the masses; the same is true of gravity. The possibility exists, therefore,that gravity itself is a pseudo force. Is it not possible that perhaps gravitation isdue simply to the fact that we do not have the right coordinate system? Afterall, we can always get a force proportional to the mass if we imagine that abody is accelerating. For instance, a man shut up in a box that is standingstill on the earth ﬁnds himself held to the ﬂoor of the box with a certain forcethat is proportional to his mass. But if there were no earth at all and the boxwere standing still, the man inside would ﬂoat in space. On the other hand, ifthere were no earth at all and something were pulling the box along with anacceleration g, then the man in the box, analyzing physics, would ﬁnd a pseudoforce which would pull him to the ﬂoor, just as gravity does.

Einstein put forward the famous hypothesis that accelerations give an imitationof gravitation, that the forces of acceleration (the pseudo forces) cannot bedistinguished from those of gravity; it is not possible to tell how much of a givenforce is gravity and how much is pseudo force.

It might seem all right to consider gravity to be a pseudo force, to say that weare all held down because we are accelerating upward, but how about the peoplein Madagascar, on the other side of the earth—are they accelerating too? Einsteinfound that gravity could be considered a pseudo force only at one point at a time,and was led by his considerations to suggest that the geometry of the world ismore complicated than ordinary Euclidean geometry. The present discussion isonly qualitative, and does not pretend to convey anything more than the generalidea. To give a rough idea of how gravitation could be the result of pseudo forces,we present an illustration which is purely geometrical and does not represent the

12-19

real situation. Suppose that we all lived in two dimensions, and knew nothing ofa third. We think we are on a plane, but suppose we are really on the surface of asphere. And suppose that we shoot an object along the ground, with no forces onit. Where will it go? It will appear to go in a straight line, but it has to remainon the surface of a sphere, where the shortest distance between two points isalong a great circle; so it goes along a great circle. If we shoot another objectsimilarly, but in another direction, it goes along another great circle. Becausewe think we are on a plane, we expect that these two bodies will continue todiverge linearly with time, but careful observation will show that if they go farenough they move closer together again, as though they were attracting eachother. But they are not attracting each other—there is just something「weird」about this geometry. This particular illustration does not describe correctly theway in which Einstein’s geometry is「weird,」but it illustrates that if we distortthe geometry suﬃciently it is possible that all gravitation is related in some wayto pseudo forces; that is the general idea of the Einsteinian theory of gravitation.

12-6 Nuclear forcesWe conclude this chapter with a brief discussion of the only other knownforces, which are called nuclear forces. These forces are within the nuclei ofatoms, and although they are much discussed, no one has ever calculated theforce between two nuclei, and indeed at present there is no known law for nuclearforces. These forces have a very tiny range which is just about the same asthe size of the nucleus, perhaps 10−13 centimeter. With particles so small andat such a tiny distance, only the quantum-mechanical laws are valid, not theNewtonian laws. In nuclear analysis we no longer think in terms of forces, and infact we can replace the force concept with a concept of the energy of interactionof two particles, a subject that will be discussed later. Any formula that canbe written for nuclear forces is a rather crude approximation which omits manycomplications; one might be somewhat as follows: forces within a nucleus donot vary inversely as the square of the distance, but die oﬀ exponentially over acertain distance r, as expressed by F = (1/r2) exp(−r/r0), where the distance r0is of the order of 10−13 centimeter. In other words, the forces disappear as soonas the particles are any great distance apart, although they are very strongwithin the 10−13 centimeter range. So far as they are understood today, the lawsof nuclear force are very complex; we do not understand them in any simpleway, and the whole problem of analyzing the fundamental machinery behind

12-20

nuclear forces is unsolved. Attempts at a solution have led to the discovery ofnumerous strange particles, the π-mesons, for example, but the origin of theseforces remains obscure.
