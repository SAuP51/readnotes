The Origin of the Refractive Index

31-1 The index of refractionWe have said before that light goes slower in water than in air, and slower,slightly, in air than in vacuum. This eﬀect is described by the index of refraction n.Now we would like to understand how such a slower velocity could come about. Inparticular, we should try to see what the relation is to some physical assumptions,or statements, we made earlier, which were the following:

(a) That the total electric ﬁeld in any physical circumstance can always berepresented by the sum of the ﬁelds from all the charges in the universe.(b) That the ﬁeld from a single charge is given by its acceleration evaluated

with a retardation at the speed c, always (for the radiation ﬁeld).

But, for a piece of glass, you might think:「Oh, no, you should modify allthis. You should say it is retarded at the speed c/n.」That, however, is not right,and we have to understand why it is not.It is approximately true that light or any electrical wave does appear to travelat the speed c/n through a material whose index of refraction is n, but theﬁelds are still produced by the motions of all the charges—including the chargesmoving in the material—and with these basic contributions of the ﬁeld travellingat the ultimate velocity c. Our problem is to understand how the apparentlyslower velocity comes about.We shall try to understand the eﬀect in a very simple case. A source which weshall call「the external source」is placed a large distance away from a thin plateof transparent material, say glass. We inquire about the ﬁeld at a large distanceon the opposite side of the plate. The situation is illustrated by the diagramof Fig. 31-1, where S and P are imagined to be very far away from the plate.According to the principles we have stated earlier, an electric ﬁeld anywhere

31-1

material.

that is far from all moving charges is the (vector) sum of the ﬁelds produced bythe external source (at S) and the ﬁelds produced by each of the charges in theplate of glass, every one with its proper retardation at the velocity c. Rememberthat the contribution of each charge is not changed by the presence of the othercharges. These are our basic principles. The ﬁeld at P can be written thus:

E = XE = Es + X

all charges

Eeach charge

Eeach charge,

(31.1)

(31.2)

or

all other charges

where Es is the ﬁeld due to the source alone and would be precisely the ﬁeldat P if there were no material present. We expect the ﬁeld at P to be diﬀerentfrom Es if there are any other moving charges.Why should there be charges moving in the glass? We know that all materialconsists of atoms which contain electrons. When the electric ﬁeld of the sourceacts on these atoms it drives the electrons up and down, because it exerts aforce on the electrons. And moving electrons generate a ﬁeld—they constitutenew radiators. These new radiators are related to the source S, because theyare driven by the ﬁeld of the source. The total ﬁeld is not just the ﬁeld of thesource S, but it is modiﬁed by the additional contribution from the other movingcharges. This means that the ﬁeld is not the same as the one which was therebefore the glass was there, but is modiﬁed, and it turns out that it is modiﬁedin such a way that the ﬁeld inside the glass appears to be moving at a diﬀerentspeed. That is the idea which we would like to work out quantitatively.

31-2

Now this is, in the exact case, pretty complicated, because although we havesaid that all the other moving charges are driven by the source ﬁeld, that is notquite true. If we think of a particular charge, it feels not only the source, but likeanything else in the world, it feels all of the charges that are moving. It feels,in particular, the charges that are moving somewhere else in the glass. So thetotal ﬁeld which is acting on a particular charge is a combination of the ﬁeldsfrom the other charges, whose motions depend on what this particular charge isdoing! You can see that it would take a complicated set of equations to get thecomplete and exact formula. It is so complicated that we postpone this problemuntil next year.

Instead we shall work out a very simple case in order to understand all thephysical principles very clearly. We take a circumstance in which the eﬀects fromthe other atoms are very small relative to the eﬀects from the source. In otherwords, we take a material in which the total ﬁeld is not modiﬁed very muchby the motion of the other charges. That corresponds to a material in whichthe index of refraction is very close to 1, which will happen, for example, if thedensity of the atoms is very low. Our calculation will be valid for any case inwhich the index is for any reason very close to 1. In this way we shall avoid thecomplications of the most general, complete solution.

Incidentally, you should notice that there is another eﬀect caused by themotion of the charges in the plate. These charges will also radiate waves backtoward the source S. This backward-going ﬁeld is the light we see reﬂected fromthe surfaces of transparent materials. It does not come from just the surface. Thebackward radiation comes from everywhere in the interior, but it turns out thatthe total eﬀect is equivalent to a reﬂection from the surfaces. These reﬂectioneﬀects are beyond our approximation at the moment because we shall be limitedto a calculation for a material with an index so close to 1 that very little light isreﬂected.

Before we proceed with our study of how the index of refraction comes about,we should understand that all that is required to understand refraction is tounderstand why the apparent wave velocity is diﬀerent in diﬀerent materials. Thebending of light rays comes about just because the eﬀective speed of the waves isdiﬀerent in the materials. To remind you how that comes about we have drawnin Fig. 31-2 several successive crests of an electric wave which arrives from avacuum onto the surface of a block of glass. The arrow perpendicular to the

31-3

wave crests indicates the direction of travel of the wave. Now all oscillations inthe wave must have the same frequency. (We have seen that driven oscillationshave the same frequency as the driving source.) This means, also, that the wavecrests for the waves on both sides of the surface must have the same spacingalong the surface because they must travel together, so that a charge sittingat the boundary will feel only one frequency. The shortest distance betweencrests of the wave, however, is the wavelength which is the velocity divided bythe frequency. On the vacuum side it is λ0 = 2πc/ω, and on the other side it isλ = 2πv/ω or 2πc/ωn, if v = c/n is the velocity of the wave. From the ﬁgure wecan see that the only way for the waves to「ﬁt」properly at the boundary is forthe waves in the material to be travelling at a diﬀerent angle with respect to thesurface. From the geometry of the ﬁgure you can see that for a「ﬁt」we musthave λ0/ sin θ0 = λ/ sin θ, or sin θ0/ sin θ = n, which is Snell’s law. We shall, forthe rest of our discussion, consider only why light has an eﬀective speed of c/nin material of index n, and no longer worry, in this chapter, about the bendingof the light direction.

We go back now to the situation shown in Fig. 31-1. We see that what wehave to do is to calculate the ﬁeld produced at P by all the oscillating chargesin the glass plate. We shall call this part of the ﬁeld Ea, and it is just the sumwritten as the second term in Eq. (31.2). When we add it to the term Es, due tothe source, we will have the total ﬁeld at P.

31-4

This is probably the most complicated thing that we are going to do thisyear, but it is complicated only in that there are many pieces that have to be puttogether; each piece, however, is very simple. Unlike other derivations where wesay,「Forget the derivation, just look at the answer!,」in this case we do not needthe answer so much as the derivation. In other words, the thing to understandnow is the physical machinery for the production of the index.

To see where we are going, let us ﬁrst ﬁnd out what the「correction ﬁeld」Eawould have to be if the total ﬁeld at P is going to look like radiation from thesource that is slowed down while passing through the thin plate. If the plate hadno eﬀect on it, the ﬁeld of a wave travelling to the right (along the z-axis) wouldbe(31.3)

Es = E0 cos ω(t − z/c)

or, using the exponential notation,

Es = E0eiω(t−z/c).

(31.4)Now what would happen if the wave travelled more slowly in going throughthe plate? Let us call the thickness of the plate ∆z. If the plate were not there thewave would travel the distance ∆z in the time ∆z/c. But if it appears to travelat the speed c/n then it should take the longer time n ∆z/c or the additionaltime ∆t = (n − 1) ∆z/c. After that it would continue to travel at the speed cagain. We can take into account the extra delay in getting through the plate byreplacing t in Eq. (31.4) by (t − ∆t) or by [t − (n − 1) ∆z/c]. So the wave afterinsertion of the plate should be written

Eafter plate = E0eiω[t−(n−1) ∆z/c−z/c].

(31.5)

We can also write this equation as

Eafter plate = e−iω(n−1) ∆z/cE0eiω(t−z/c),

(31.6)which says that the wave after the plate is obtained from the wave which couldexist without the plate, i.e., from Es, by multiplying by the factor e−iω(n−1) ∆z/c.Now we know that multiplying an oscillating function like eiωt by a factor eiθjust says that we change the phase of the oscillation by the angle θ, which is, ofcourse, what the extra delay in passing through the thickness ∆z has done. Ithas retarded the phase by the amount ω(n − 1) ∆z/c (retarded, because of theminus sign in the exponent).

31-5

We have said earlier that the plate should add a ﬁeld Ea to the originalﬁeld Es = E0eiω(t−z/c), but we have found instead that the eﬀect of the plate isto multiply the ﬁeld by a factor which shifts its phase. However, that is really allright because we can get the same result by adding a suitable complex number.It is particularly easy to ﬁnd the right number to add in the case that ∆z issmall, for you will remember that if x is a small number then ex is nearly equalto (1 + x). We can write, therefore,

e−iω(n−1) ∆z/c = 1 − iω(n − 1) ∆z/c.

(31.7)

Using this equality in Eq. (31.6), we have

Eafter plate = E0eiω(t−z/c)

E0eiω(t−z/c)

The ﬁrst term is just the ﬁeld from the source, and the second term must just beequal to Ea, the ﬁeld produced to the right of the plate by the oscillating chargesof the plate—expressed here in terms of the index of refraction n, and depending,of course, on the strength of the wave from the source.

What we have been doing is easily visualized if we look at the complex numberdiagram in Fig. 31-3. We ﬁrst draw the number Es (we chose some values forz and t so that Es comes out horizontal, but this is not necessary). The delaydue to slowing down in the plate would delay the phase of this number, that is,it would rotate Es through a negative angle. But this is equivalent to addingthe small vector Ea at roughly right angles to Es. But that is just what thefactor −i means in the second term of Eq. (31.8). It says that if Es is real, thenEa is negative imaginary or that, in general, Es and Ea make a right angle.

31-2 The ﬁeld due to the materialWe now have to ask: Is the ﬁeld Ea obtained in the second term of Eq. (31.8)the kind we would expect from oscillating charges in the plate? If we can show[Since nthat it is, we will then have calculated what the index n should be!is the only nonfundamental number in Eq. (31.8).] We turn now to calculatingwhat ﬁeld Ea the charges in the material will produce. (To help you keep trackof the many symbols we have used up to now, and will be using in the rest ofour calculation, we have put them all together in Table 31-1.)

If the source S (of Fig. 31-1) is far oﬀ to the left, then the ﬁeld Es will havethe same phase everywhere on the plate, so we can write that in the neighborhoodof the plate

Es = E0eiω(t−z/c).

(31.9)

Right at the plate, where z = 0, we will have

Es = E0eiωt (at the plate).

(31.10)Each of the electrons in the atoms of the plate will feel this electric ﬁeldand will be driven up and down (we assume the direction of E0 is vertical) bythe electric force qE. To ﬁnd what motion we expect for the electrons, we will

31-7

assume that the atoms are little oscillators, that is, that the electrons are fastenedelastically to the atoms, which means that if a force is applied to an electron itsdisplacement from its normal position will be proportional to the force.

You may think that this is a funny model of an atom if you have heard aboutelectrons whirling around in orbits. But that is just an oversimpliﬁed picture.The correct picture of an atom, which is given by the theory of wave mechanics,says that, so far as problems involving light are concerned, the electrons behaveas though they were held by springs. So we shall suppose that the electrons havea linear restoring force which, together with their mass m, makes them behavelike little oscillators, with a resonant frequency ω0. We have already studied suchoscillators, and we know that the equation of their motion is written this way:

from the source, so we should use

For our problem, the driving force comes from the electric ﬁeld of the wave

F = qeEs = qeE0eiωt,

(31.12)where qe is the electric charge on the electron and for Es we use the expres-sion Es = E0eiωt from (31.10). Our equation of motion for the electron isthen

(31.16)

We have what we needed to know—the motion of the electrons in the plate. Andit is the same for every electron, except that the mean position (the「zero」ofthe motion) is, of course, diﬀerent for each electron.

Now we are ready to ﬁnd the ﬁeld Ea that these atoms produce at thepoint P, because we have already worked out (at the end of Chapter 30) whatﬁeld is produced by a sheet of charges that all move together. Referring back toEq. (30.19), we see that the ﬁeld Ea at P is just a negative constant times thevelocity of the charges retarded in time by the amount z/c. Diﬀerentiating x inEq. (31.16) to get the velocity, and sticking in the retardation [or just putting x0from (31.15) into (30.18)] yields

(31.17)

Just as we expected, the driven motion of the electrons produced an extra wavewhich travels to the right (that is what the factor eiω(t−z/c) says), and theamplitude of this wave is proportional to the number of atoms per unit areain the plate (the factor η) and also proportional to the strength of the sourceﬁeld (the factor E0). Then there are some factors which depend on the atomicproperties (qe, m, and ω0), as we should expect.The most important thing, however, is that this formula (31.17) for Ea looksvery much like the expression for Ea that we got in Eq. (31.8) by saying thatthe original wave was delayed in passing through a material with an index ofrefraction n. The two expressions will, in fact, be identical if

(n − 1) ∆z =

(31.18)

Notice that both sides are proportional to ∆z, since η, which is the number ofatoms per unit area, is equal to N ∆z, where N is the number of atoms per unitvolume of the plate. Substituting N ∆z for η and cancelling the ∆z, we get ourmain result, a formula for the index of refraction in terms of the properties ofthe atoms of the material—and of the frequency of the light:

n = 1 +

(31.19)

This equation gives the「explanation」of the index of refraction that we wishedto obtain.

31-9

31-3 DispersionNotice that in the above process we have obtained something very interesting.For we have not only a number for the index of refraction which can be computedfrom the basic atomic quantities, but we have also learned how the index ofrefraction should vary with the frequency ω of the light. This is something wewould never understand from the simple statement that「light travels slower ina transparent material.」We still have the problem, of course, of knowing howmany atoms per unit volume there are, and what is their natural frequency ω0.We do not know this just yet, because it is diﬀerent for every diﬀerent material,and we cannot get a general theory of that now. Formulation of a general theoryof the properties of diﬀerent substances—their natural frequencies, and so on—ispossible only with quantum atomic mechanics. Also, diﬀerent materials havediﬀerent properties and diﬀerent indexes, so we cannot expect, anyway, to get ageneral formula for the index which will apply to all substances.

However, we shall discuss the formula we have obtained, in various possiblecircumstances. First of all, for most ordinary gases (for instance, for air, mostcolorless gases, hydrogen, helium, and so on) the natural frequencies of theelectron oscillators correspond to ultraviolet light. These frequencies are higherthan the frequencies of visible light, that is, ω0 is much larger than ω of visiblelight, and to a ﬁrst approximation, we can disregard ω2 in comparison with ω20.Then we ﬁnd that the index is nearly constant. So for a gas, the index is nearlyconstant. This is also true for most other transparent substances, like glass. Ifwe look at our expression a little more closely, however, we notice that as ω rises,taking a little bit more away from the denominator, the index also rises. So nrises slowly with frequency. The index is higher for blue light than for red light.That is the reason why a prism bends the light more in the blue than in the red.The phenomenon that the index depends upon the frequency is called thephenomenon of dispersion, because it is the basis of the fact that light is「dispersed」by a prism into a spectrum. The equation for the index of refraction as a functionof frequency is called a dispersion equation. So we have obtained a dispersionequation. (In the past few years「dispersion equations」have been ﬁnding a newuse in the theory of elementary particles.)

Our dispersion equation suggests other interesting eﬀects.

If we have anatural frequency ω0 which lies in the visible region, or if we measure the indexof refraction of a material like glass in the ultraviolet, where ω gets near ω0, wesee that at frequencies very close to the natural frequency the index can get

31-10

0 in comparison with ω2).

enormously large, because the denominator can go to zero. Next, suppose that ωis greater than ω0. This would occur, for example, if we take a material like glass,say, and shine x-ray radiation on it. In fact, since many materials which areopaque to visible light, like graphite for instance, are transparent to x-rays, wecan also talk about the index of refraction of carbon for x-rays. All the naturalfrequencies of the carbon atoms would be much lower than the frequency we areusing in the x-rays, since x-ray radiation has a very high frequency. The index ofrefraction is that given by our dispersion equation if we set ω0 equal to zero (weneglect ω2A similar situation would occur if we beam radiowaves (or light) on a gasof free electrons. In the upper atmosphere electrons are liberated from theiratoms by ultraviolet light from the sun and they sit up there as free electrons.For free electrons ω0 = 0 (there is no elastic restoring force). Setting ω0 = 0 inour dispersion equation yields the correct formula for the index of refraction forradiowaves in the stratosphere, where N is now to represent the density of freeelectrons (number per unit volume) in the stratosphere. But let us look again atthe equation, if we beam x-rays on matter, or radiowaves (or any electric waves)0 − ω2) becomes negative, and we obtain the resulton free electrons the term (ω2that n is less than one. That means that the eﬀective speed of the waves in thesubstance is faster than c! Can that be correct?It is correct. In spite of the fact that it is said that you cannot send signals anyfaster than the speed of light, it is nevertheless true that the index of refraction ofmaterials at a particular frequency can be either greater or less than 1. This justmeans that the phase shift which is produced by the scattered light can be eitherpositive or negative. It can be shown, however, that the speed at which you cansend a signal is not determined by the index at one frequency, but depends onwhat the index is at many frequencies. What the index tells us is the speed atwhich the nodes (or crests) of the wave travel. The node of a wave is not a signalby itself. In a perfect wave, which has no modulations of any kind, i.e., which isa steady oscillation, you cannot really say when it「starts,」so you cannot useit for a timing signal. In order to send a signal you have to change the wavesomehow, make a notch in it, make it a little bit fatter or thinner. That meansthat you have to have more than one frequency in the wave, and it can be shownthat the speed at which signals travel is not dependent upon the index alone,but upon the way that the index changes with the frequency. This subject wemust also delay (until Chapter 48). Then we will calculate for you the actualspeed of signals through such a piece of glass, and you will see that it will not

31-11

be faster than the speed of light, although the nodes, which are mathematicalpoints, do travel faster than the speed of light.

Just to give a slight hint as to how that happens, you will note that the realdiﬃculty has to do with the fact that the responses of the charges are oppositeto the ﬁeld, i.e., the sign has gotten reversed. Thus in our expression for x(Eq. 31.16) the displacement of the charge is in the direction opposite to the0 − ω2) is negative for small ω0. The formula says thatdriving ﬁeld, because (ω2when the electric ﬁeld is pulling in one direction, the charge is moving in theopposite direction.

How does the charge happen to be going in the opposite direction? It certainlydoes not start oﬀ in the opposite direction when the ﬁeld is ﬁrst turned on. Whenthe motion ﬁrst starts there is a transient, which settles down after awhile, andonly then is the phase of the oscillation of the charge opposite to the drivingﬁeld. And it is then that the phase of the transmitted ﬁeld can appear to beadvanced with respect to the source wave. It is this advance in phase which ismeant when we say that the「phase velocity」or velocity of the nodes is greaterthan c. In Fig. 31-4 we give a schematic idea of how the waves might look fora case where the wave is suddenly turned on (to make a signal). You will seefrom the diagram that the signal (i.e., the start of the wave) is not earlier forthe wave which ends up with an advance in phase.

Let us now look again at our dispersion equation. We should remark thatour analysis of the refractive index gives a result that is somewhat simpler than

Fig. 31-4. Wave「signals.」

31-12

you would actually ﬁnd in nature. To be completely accurate we must add somereﬁnements. First, we should expect that our model of the atomic oscillatorshould have some damping force (otherwise once started it would oscillate forever,and we do not expect that to happen). We have worked out before (Eq. 23.8)the motion of a damped oscillator and the result is that the denominator in0−ω2+iγω),Eq. (31.16), and therefore in (31.19), is changed from (ω2where γ is the damping coeﬃcient.We need a second modiﬁcation to take into account the fact that there areseveral resonant frequencies for a particular kind of atom. It is easy to ﬁx upour dispersion equation by imagining that there are several diﬀerent kinds ofoscillators, but that each oscillator acts separately, and so we simply add thecontributions of all the oscillators. Let us say that there are Nk electrons perunit of volume, whose natural frequency is ωk and whose damping factor is γk.We would then have for our dispersion equation

(31.20)

We have, ﬁnally, a complete expression which describes the index of refractionthat is observed for many substances.* The index described by this formula varieswith frequency roughly like the curve shown in Fig. 31-5.

You will note that so long as ω is not too close to one of the resonantfrequencies, the slope of the curve is positive. Such a positive slope is called

Fig. 31-5. The index of refraction as a function of frequency.

* Actually, although in quantum mechanics Eq. (31.20) is still valid, its interpretation issomewhat diﬀerent. In quantum mechanics even an atom with one electron, like hydrogen, hasseveral resonant frequencies. Therefore Nk is not really the number of electrons having thefrequency ωk, but is replaced instead by N fk, where N is the number of atoms per unit volumeand fk (called the oscillator strength) is a factor that tells how strongly the atom exhibits eachof its resonant frequencies ωk.

31-13

「normal」dispersion (because it is clearly the most common occurrence). Verynear the resonant frequencies, however, there is a small range of ω’s for whichthe slope is negative. Such a negative slope is often referred to as「anomalous」(meaning abnormal) dispersion, because it seemed unusual when it was ﬁrstobserved, long before anyone even knew there were such things as electrons.From our point of view both slopes are quite「normal」!

31-4 AbsorptionPerhaps you have noticed something a little strange about the last form(Eq. 31.20) we obtained for our dispersion equation. Because of the term iγwe put in to take account of damping, the index of refraction is now a complexnumber! What does that mean? By working out what the real and imaginaryparts of n are we could write

n = n0 − in00,

(31.21)where n0 and n00 are real numbers. (We use the minus sign in front of the in00because then n00 will turn out to be a positive number, as you can show foryourself.)We can see what such a complex index means by going back to Eq. (31.6),which is the equation of the wave after it goes through a plate of material withan index n. If we put our complex n into this equation, and do some rearranging,we get

Eafter plate = e−ωn00 ∆z/c

The last factors, marked B in Eq. (31.22), are just the form we had before, andagain describe a wave whose phase has been delayed by the angle ω(n0 − 1) ∆z/cin traversing the material. The ﬁrst term (A) is new and is an exponentialfactor with a real exponent, because there were two i’s that cancelled. Also, theexponent is negative, so the factor is a real number less than one. It describes adecrease in the magnitude of the ﬁeld and, as we should expect, by an amountwhich is more the larger ∆z is. As the wave goes through the material, it isweakened. The material is「absorbing」part of the wave. The wave comes outthe other side with less energy. We should not be surprised at this, becausethe damping we put in for the oscillators is indeed a friction force and must

31-14

be expected to cause a loss of energy. We see that the imaginary part n00 of acomplex index of refraction represents an absorption (or「attenuation」) of thewave. In fact, n00 is sometimes referred to as the「absorption index.」We may also point out that an imaginary part to the index n correspondsto bending the arrow Ea in Fig. 31-3 toward the origin. It is clear why thetransmitted ﬁeld is then decreased.Normally, for instance as in glass, the absorption of light is very small.This is to be expected from our Eq. (31.20), because the imaginary part of thek − ω2). But if the lightdenominator, iγkω, is much smaller than the term (ω2k − ω2) can becomefrequency ω is very close to ωk then the resonance term (ω2small compared with iγkω and the index becomes almost completely imaginary.The absorption of the light becomes the dominant eﬀect. It is just this eﬀectthat gives the dark lines in the spectrum of light which we receive from the sun.The light from the solar surface has passed through the sun’s atmosphere (aswell as the earth’s), and the light has been strongly absorbed at the resonantfrequencies of the atoms in the solar atmosphere.

The observation of such spectral lines in the sunlight allows us to tell theresonant frequencies of the atoms and hence the chemical composition of thesun’s atmosphere. The same kind of observations tell us about the materials inthe stars. From such measurements we know that the chemical elements in thesun and in the stars are the same as those we ﬁnd on the earth.

31-5 The energy carried by an electric waveWe have seen that the imaginary part of the index means absorption. Weshall now use this knowledge to ﬁnd out how much energy is carried by a lightwave. We have given earlier an argument that the energy carried by light isproportional to E2, the time average of the square of the electric ﬁeld in thewave. The decrease in E due to absorption must mean a loss of energy, whichwould go into some friction of the electrons and, we might guess, would end upas heat in the material.

If we consider the light arriving on a unit area, say one square centimeter,of our plate in Fig. 31-1, then we can write the following energy equation (if weassume that energy is conserved, as we do!):

For the second term we must include the part from the radiatingatoms of the material, so we should use α(Es + Ea)2, or (evaluating the square)α(E2All of our calculations have been made for a thin layer of material whoseindex is not too far from 1, so that Ea would always be much less than Es (justto make the calculations easier). In keeping with our approximations, we should,therefore, leave out the term E2, because it is much smaller than EsEa. Youmay say:「Then you should leave out EsEa also, because it is much smallerthan E2, but we must keepEsEa or our approximation will be the one that would apply if we neglected thepresence of the material completely! One way of checking that our calculationsare consistent is to see that we always keep terms which are proportional to N ∆z,the area density of atoms in the material, but we leave out terms which areproportional to (N ∆z)2 or any higher power of N ∆z. Ours is what should becalled a「low-density approximation.」In the same spirit, we might remark that our energy equation has neglectedthe energy in the reﬂected wave. But that is OK because this term, too, isproportional to (N ∆z)2, since the amplitude of the reﬂected wave is proportionalto N ∆z.For the last term in Eq. (31.23) we wish to compute the rate at which theincoming wave is doing work on the electrons. We know that work is force timesdistance, so the rate of doing work (also called power) is the force times thevelocity. It is really F · v, but we do not need to worry about the dot productwhen the velocity and force are along the same direction as they are here (exceptfor a possible minus sign). So for each atom we take qeEsv for the average rateof doing work. Since there are N ∆z atoms in a unit area, the last term inEq. (31.23) should be N ∆z qeEsv. Our energy equation now looks like

terms cancel, and we have

2αEsEa = −N ∆z qeEsv.

We now go back to Eq. (31.19), which tells us that for large z

Ea = − N ∆z qe20c

However, Es(at z) is Es(at atoms) retarded by z/c. Since the average is inde-pendent of time, it is the same now as retarded by z/c, or is Es(at atoms) · v,the same average that appears on the right-hand side of (31.25). The two sidesare therefore equal if

= 1,

or

α = 0c.

We have discovered that if energy is to be conserved, the energy carried in anelectric wave per unit area and per unit time (or what we have called the intensity)must be given by 0cE2. If we call the intensity S, we have

31-6 Diﬀraction of light by a screenIt is now a good time to take up a somewhat diﬀerent matter which we canhandle with the machinery of this chapter. In the last chapter we said thatwhen you have an opaque screen and the light can come through some holes, thedistribution of intensity—the diﬀraction pattern—could be obtained by imagininginstead that the holes are replaced by sources (oscillators) uniformly distributedover the hole. In other words, the diﬀracted wave is the same as though the holewere a new source. We have to explain the reason for that, because the hole is, ofcourse, just where there are no sources, where there are no accelerating charges.Let us ﬁrst ask:「What is an opaque screen?」Suppose we have a completelyopaque screen between a source S and an observer at P, as in Fig. 31-6(a). If thescreen is「opaque」there is no ﬁeld at P. Why is there no ﬁeld there? Accordingto the basic principles we should obtain the ﬁeld at P as the ﬁeld Es of thesource delayed, plus the ﬁeld from all the other charges around. But, as wehave seen above, the charges in the screen will be set in motion by the ﬁeld Es,

31-17

and these motions generate a new ﬁeld which, if the screen is opaque, mustexactly cancel the ﬁeld Es on the back side of the screen. You say:「What amiracle that it balances exactly! Suppose it was not exactly right!」If it werenot exactly right (remember that this opaque screen has some thickness), theﬁeld toward the rear part of the screen would not be exactly zero. So, notbeing zero, it would set into motion some other charges in the material ofthe screen, and thus make a little more ﬁeld, trying to get the total balancedout. So if we make the screen thick enough, there is no residual ﬁeld, becausethere is enough opportunity to ﬁnally get the thing quieted down. In termsof our formulas above we would say that the screen has a large and imaginaryindex, so the wave is absorbed exponentially as it goes through. You know,of course, that a thin enough sheet of the most opaque material, even gold, istransparent.

Now let us see what happens with an opaque screen which has holes in it, asin Fig. 31-6(b). What do we expect for the ﬁeld at P? The ﬁeld at P can berepresented as a sum of two parts—the ﬁeld due to the source S plus the ﬁelddue to the wall, i.e., due to the motions of the charges in the walls. We mightexpect the motions of the charges in the walls to be complicated, but we can ﬁndout what ﬁelds they produce in a rather simple way.

31-18

Suppose that we were to take the same screen, but plug up the holes, asindicated in part (c) of the ﬁgure. We imagine that the plugs are of exactlythe same material as the wall. Mind you, the plugs go where the holes were incase (b). Now let us calculate the ﬁeld at P. The ﬁeld at P is certainly zero incase (c), but it is also equal to the ﬁeld from the source plus the ﬁeld due toall the motions of the atoms in the walls and in the plugs. We can write thefollowing equations:

Case (b): Eat P = Es + Ewall,Case (c): E0= 0 = Es + E0

at P

wall + E0

plug,

where the primes refer to the case where the plugs are in place, but Es is, ofcourse, the same in both cases. Now if we subtract the two equations, we get

Eat P = (Ewall − E0

wall) − E0

plug.

Now if the holes are not too small (say many wavelengths across), we would notexpect the presence of the plugs to change the ﬁelds which arrive at the wallsexcept possibly for a little bit around the edges of the holes. Neglecting thissmall eﬀect, we can set Ewall = E0

wall and obtain thatEat P = −E0

plug.

We have the result that the ﬁeld at P when there are holes in a screen (caseb) is the same (except for sign) as the ﬁeld that is produced by that part of acomplete opaque wall which is located where the holes are! (The sign is not toointeresting, since we are usually interested in intensity which is proportional tothe square of the ﬁeld.) It seems like an amazing backwards-forwards argument.It is, however, not only true (approximately for not too small holes), but useful,and is the justiﬁcation for the usual theory of diﬀraction.

The ﬁeld E0

plug is computed in any particular case by remembering that themotion of the charges everywhere in the screen is just that which will cancel outthe ﬁeld Es on the back of the screen. Once we know these motions, we add theradiation ﬁelds at P due just to the charges in the plugs.We remark again that this theory of diﬀraction is only approximate, and willbe good only if the holes are not too small. For holes which are too small theE0plug term will be small and then the diﬀerence between E0wall and Ewall (whichdiﬀerence we have taken to be zero) may be comparable to or larger than thesmall E0

plug term, and our approximation will no longer be valid.
