Waves

51-1 Bow wavesAlthough we have ﬁnished our quantitative analyses of waves, this addedchapter on the subject is intended to give some appreciation, qualitatively, forvarious phenomena that are associated with waves, which are too complicatedto analyze in detail here. Since we have been dealing with waves for severalchapters, more properly the subject might be called「some of the more complexphenomena associated with waves.」

The ﬁrst topic to be discussed concerns the eﬀects that are produced bya source of waves which is moving faster than the wave velocity, or the phasevelocity. Let us ﬁrst consider waves that have a deﬁnite velocity, like sound andlight. If we have a source of sound which is moving faster than the speed ofsound, then something like this happens: Suppose at a given moment a soundwave is generated from the source at point x1 in Fig. 51-1; then, in the next

Fig. 51-1. The shock wave front lies on a cone with apex at the

source and half-angle θ = sin−1 cw /v.

51-1

moment, as the source moves to x2, the wave from x1 expands by a radius r1smaller than the distance that the source moves; and, of course, another wavestarts from x2. When the sound source has moved still farther, to x3, and a waveis starting there, the wave from x2 has now expanded to r2, and the one from x1has expanded to r3. Of course the thing is done continuously, not in steps, andtherefore, we have a series of wave circles with a common tangent line whichgoes through the center of the source. We see that instead of a source generatingspherical waves, as it would if it were standing still, it generates a wavefrontwhich forms a cone in three dimensions, or a pair of lines in two dimensions. Theangle of the cone is very easy to ﬁgure out. In a given amount of time the sourcemoves a distance, say x3 − x1, proportional to v, the velocity of the source. Inthe meantime the wavefront has moved out a distance r3, proportional to cw, thespeed of the wave. Therefore it is clear that the half-angle of opening has a sineequal to the ratio of the speed of the waves, divided by the speed of the source,and this sine has a solution only if cw is less than v, or the speed of the object isfaster than the speed of the wave:

sin θ = cwv

.

(51.1)

Incidentally, although we implied that it is necessary to have a source ofsound, it turns out, very interestingly, that once the object is moving faster thanthe speed of sound, it will make sound. That is, it is not necessary that it have acertain tone vibrational character. Any object moving through a medium fasterthan the speed at which the medium carries waves will generate waves on eachside, automatically, just from the motion itself. This is simple in the case ofsound, but it also occurs in the case of light. At ﬁrst one might think nothing canmove faster than the speed of light. However, light in glass has a phase velocityless than the speed of light in a vacuum, and it is possible to shoot a chargedparticle of very high energy through a block of glass such that the particle velocityis close to the speed of light in a vacuum, while the speed of light in the glass may3 the speed of light in the vacuum. A particle moving faster than thebe only 2speed of light in the medium will produce a conical wave of light with its apex atthe source, like the wave wake from a boat (which is from the same eﬀect, as amatter of fact). By measuring the cone angle, we can determine the speed of theparticle. This is used technically to determine the speeds of particles as one ofthe methods of determining their energy in high-energy research. The directionof the light is all that needs to be measured.

than sound.

This light is sometimes called Cherenkov radiation, because it was ﬁrst ob-served by Cherenkov. How intense this light should be was analyzed theoreticallyby Frank and Tamm. The 1958 Nobel Prize for physics was awarded jointly toall three for this work.

The corresponding circumstances in the case of sound are illustrated inFig. 51-2, which is a photograph of an object moving through a gas at a speedgreater than the speed of sound. The changes in pressure produce a change inrefractive index, and with a suitable optical system the edges of the waves can bemade visible. We see that the object moving faster than the speed of sound does,indeed, produce a conical wave. But closer inspection reveals that the surface isactually curved. It is straight asymptotically, but it is curved near the apex, andwe have now to discuss how that can be, which brings us to the second topic ofthis chapter.

51-2 Shock wavesWave speed often depends on the amplitude, and in the case of sound the speeddepends upon the amplitude in the following way. An object moving through theair has to move the air out of the way, so the disturbance produced in this case

51-3

is some kind of a pressure step, with the pressure higher behind the wavefrontthan in the undisturbed region not yet reached by the wave (running along at thenormal speed, say). But the air that is left behind, after the wavefront passes, hasbeen compressed adiabatically, and therefore the temperature is increased. Nowthe speed of sound increases with the temperature, so the speed in the regionbehind the jump is faster than in the air in front. That means that any otherdisturbance that is made behind this step, say by a continuous pushing of the body,or any other disturbance, will ride faster than the front, the speed increasing withhigher pressure. Figure 51-3 illustrates the situation, with some little bumps ofpressure added to the pressure contour to aid visualization. We see that the higherpressure regions at the rear overtake the front as time goes on, until ultimatelythe compressional wave develops a sharp front. If the strength is very high,「ultimately」means right away; if it as rather weak, it takes a long time; it may be,in fact, that the sound is spreading and dying out before it has time to do this.

Fig. 51-3. Wavefront「snapshots」at successive instants in time.

The sounds we make in talking are extremely weak relative to the atmosphericpressure—only 1 part in a million or so. But for pressure changes of the orderof 1 atmosphere, the wave velocity increases by about twenty percent, and thewavefront sharpens up at a correspondingly high rate. In nature nothing happensinﬁnitely rapidly, presumably, and what we call a「sharp」front has, actually,a very slight thickness; it is not inﬁnitely steep. The distances over which it isvarying are of the order of one mean free path, in which the theory of the waveequation begins to fail because we did not consider the structure of the gas.

Now, referring again to Fig. 51-2, we see that the curvature can be understoodif we appreciate that the pressures near the apex are higher than they are fartherback, and so the angle θ is greater. That is, the curve is the result of the fact thatthe speed depends upon the strength of the wave. Therefore the wave from anatomic bomb explosion travels much faster than the speed of sound for a while,until it gets so far out that it is weakened to such an extent from spreading that

51-4

the pressure bump is small compared with atmospheric pressure. The speed ofthe bump then approaches the speed of sound in the gas into which it is going.(Incidentally, it always turns out that the speed of the shock is higher than thespeed of sound in the gas ahead, but is lower than the speed of sound in the gasbehind. That is, impulses from the back will arrive at the front, but the frontrides into the medium in which it is going faster than the normal speed of signals.So one cannot tell, acoustically, that the shock is coming until it is too late. Thelight from the bomb arrives ﬁrst, but one cannot tell that the shock is cominguntil it arrives, because there is no sound signal coming ahead of it.)

This is a very interesting phenomenon, this piling up of waves, and the mainpoint on which it depends is that after a wave is present, the speed of the resultingwave should be higher. Another example of the same phenomenon is the following.Consider water ﬂowing in a long channel with ﬁnite width and ﬁnite depth. Ifa piston, or a wall across the channel, is moved along the channel fast enough,water piles up, like snow before a snow plow. Now suppose the situation is asshown in Fig. 51-4, with a sudden step in water height somewhere in the channel.It can be demonstrated that long waves in a channel travel faster in deeper waterthan they do in shallow water. Therefore any new bumps or irregularities inenergy supplied by the piston run oﬀ forward and pile up at the front. Again,ultimately what we have is just water with a sharp front, theoretically. However,

Figure 51-4

51-5

as Fig. 51-4 shows, there are complications. Pictured is a wave coming up achannel; the piston is at the far right end of the channel. At ﬁrst it might haveappeared like a well-behaved wave, as one might expect, but farther along thechannel, it has become sharper and sharper until the events pictured occurred.There is a terrible churning at the surface, as the pieces of water fall down, butit is essentially a very sharp rise with no disturbance of the water ahead.

Actually water is much more complicated than sound. However, just toillustrate a point, we will try to analyze the speed of such a so-called bore, ina channel. The point here is not that this is of any basic importance for ourpurposes—it is not a great generalization—it is only to illustrate that the laws ofmechanics that we already know are capable of explaining the phenomenon.

Fig. 51-5. Two cross sections of a bore in a channel, with (b) at an

interval ∆t later than (a).

Imagine, for a moment, that the water does look something like Fig. 51-5(a),that water at the higher height h2 is moving with a velocity v, and that the frontis moving with velocity u into undisturbed water which is at height h1. We wouldlike to determine the speed at which the front moves. In a time ∆t a verticalplane initially at x1 moves a distance v ∆t to x2, while the front of the wave hasmoved u ∆t.Now we apply the equations of conservation of matter and momentum. First,the former: Per unit channel width, we see that the amount h2v ∆t of matter

51-6

that has moved past x1 (shown shaded) is compensated by the other shadedregion, which amounts to (h2 − h1)u ∆t. So, dividing by ∆t, vh2 = u(h2 − h1).That does not yet give us enough, because although we have h2 and h1, we donot know either u or v; we are trying to get both of them.Now the next step is to use conservation of momentum. We have not discussedthe problems of water pressure, or anything in hydrodynamics, but it is clearanyway that the pressure of water at a given depth is just enough to hold upthe column of water above it. Therefore the pressure of water is equal to ρ, thedensity of water, times g, times the depth below the surface. Since the pressureincreases linearly with depth, the average pressure over the plane at x1, say,2 ρgh2, which is also the average force per unit width and per unit heightis 1pushing the plane toward x2. So we multiply by another h2 to get the total forcewhich is acting on the water pushing from the left. On the other hand, there ispressure in the water on the right also, exerting an opposite force on the regionin question, which is, by the same kind of analysis, 11. Now we must balancethe forces against the rate of change of the momentum. Thus we have to ﬁgureout how much more momentum there is in situation (b) in Fig. 51-5 than therewas in (a). We see that the additional mass that has acquired the speed v isjust ρh2u ∆t − ρh2v ∆t (per unit width), and multiplying this by v gives theadditional momentum to be equated to the impulse F ∆t:2 ρgh2

(ρh2u ∆t − ρh2v ∆t)v = ( 1

1) ∆t.

2 ρgh2

2 − 1

If we eliminate v from this equation by substituting vh2 = u(h2 − h1), alreadyfound, and simplify, we get ﬁnally that u2 = gh2(h1 + h2)/2h1.If the height diﬀerence is very small, so that h1 and h2 are nearly equal, thissays that the velocity = √gh. As we will see later, that is only true provided thewavelength of the wave is longer than the depth of the channel.

We could also do the analogous thing for sound waves—including the conser-vation of internal energy, not the conservation of entropy, because the shock isirreversible. In fact, if one checks the conservation of energy in the bore problem,one ﬁnds that energy is not conserved. If the height diﬀerence is small, it isalmost perfectly conserved, but as soon as the height diﬀerence becomes veryappreciable, there is a net loss of energy. This is manifested as the falling waterand the churning shown in Fig. 51-4.

In shock waves there is a corresponding apparent loss of energy, from thepoint of view of adiabatic reactions. The energy in the sound wave, behind the

51-7

shock, goes into heating of the gas after shock passes, corresponding to churningof the water in the bore. In working it out, three equations for the sound caseturn out to be necessary for solution, and the temperature behind the shock isnot the same as the temperature in front, as we have seen.

If we try to make a bore that is upside down (h2 < h1), then we ﬁnd that theenergy loss per second is negative. Since energy is not available from anywhere,that bore cannot then maintain itself; it is unstable. If we were to start a waveof that sort, it would ﬂatten out, because the speed dependence on height thatresulted in sharpening in the case we discussed would now have the oppositeeﬀect.

51-3 Waves in solidsThe next kind of waves to be discussed are the more complicated waves insolids. We have already discussed sound waves in gas and in liquid, and thereis a direct analog to a sound wave in a solid. If a sudden push is applied toa solid, it is compressed. It resists the compression, and a wave analogous tosound is started. However there is another kind of wave that is possible in asolid, and which is not possible in a ﬂuid. If a solid is distorted by pushing itsideways (called shearing), then it tries to pull itself back. That is by deﬁnitionwhat distinguishes a solid from a liquid: if we distort a liquid (internally), holdit a minute so that it calms down, and then let go, it will stay that way, but ifwe take a solid and push it, like shearing a piece of「Jello,」and let it go, it ﬂiesback and starts a shear wave, travelling in the same way the compressions travel.In all cases, the shear wave speed is less than the speed of longitudinal waves.The shear waves are somewhat more analogous, so far as their polarizations areconcerned, to light waves. Sound has no polarization, it is just a pressure wave.Light has a characteristic orientation perpendicular to its direction of travel.

In a solid, the waves are of both kinds. First, there is a compression wave,analogous to sound, that runs at one speed. If the solid is not crystalline, then ashear wave polarized in any direction will propagate at a characteristic speed.(Of course all solids are crystalline, but if we use a block made up of microcrystalsof all orientations, the crystal anisotropies average out.)

Another interesting question concerning sound waves is the following: Whathappens if the wavelength in a solid gets shorter, and shorter, and shorter? Howshort can it get? It is interesting that it cannot get any shorter than the spacebetween the atoms, because if there is supposed to be a wave in which one

51-8

point goes up and the next down, etc., the shortest possible wavelength is clearlythe atom spacing. In terms of the modes of oscillation, we say that there arelongitudinal modes, and transverse modes, long wave modes, short wave modes.As we consider wavelengths comparable to the spacing between the atoms, thenthe speeds are no longer constant; there is a dispersion eﬀect where the velocityis not independent of the wave number. But, ultimately, the highest mode oftransverse waves would be that in which every atom is doing the opposite ofneighboring atoms.

Now from the point of view of atoms, the situation is like the two pendulumsthat we were talking about, for which there are two modes, one in which theyboth go together, and the other in which they go apart. It is possible to analyzethe solid waves another way, in terms of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators,like an enormous number of pendulums, with the highest mode such that theyoscillate oppositely, and lower modes with diﬀerent relationships of the timing.The shortest wavelengths are so short that they are not usually availabletechnically. However they are of great interest because, in the theory of thermo-dynamics of a solid, the heat properties of a solid, for example speciﬁc heats, canbe analyzed in terms of the properties of the short sound waves. Going to theextreme of sound waves of ever shorter wavelength, one necessarily comes to theindividual motions of the atoms; the two things are the same ultimately.

A very interesting example of sound waves in a solid, both longitudinal andtransverse, are the waves that are in the solid earth. Who makes the noises we donot know, but inside the earth, from time to time, there are earthquakes—somerock slides past some other rock. That is like a little noise. So waves like soundwaves start out from such a source very much longer in wavelength than oneusually considers in sound waves, but still they are sound waves, and they travelaround in the earth. The earth is not homogeneous, however, and the properties,of pressure, density, compressibility, and so on, change with depth, and thereforethe speed varies with depth. Then the waves do not travel in straight lines—thereis a kind of index of refraction and they go in curves. The longitudinal wavesand the transverse waves have diﬀerent speeds, so there are diﬀerent solutions forthe diﬀerent speeds. Therefore if we place a seismograph at some location andwatch the way the thing jiggles after there has been an earthquake somewhereelse, then we do not just get an irregular jiggling. We might get a jiggling, anda quieting down, and then another jiggling—what happens depends upon thelocation. If it were close enough, we would ﬁrst receive longitudinal waves fromthe disturbance, and then, a few moments later, transverse waves, because they

51-9

transverse sound waves.

travel more slowly. By measuring the time diﬀerence between the two, we cantell how far away the earthquake is, if we know enough about the speeds andcomposition of the interior regions involved.

An example of the behavior pattern of waves in the earth is shown in Fig. 51-6.The two kinds of waves are represented by diﬀerent symbols. If there were anearthquake at the place marked「source,」the transverse waves and longitudinalwaves would arrive at diﬀerent times at the station by the most direct routes,and there would also be reﬂections at discontinuities, resulting in other pathsand times. It turns out that there is a core in the earth which does not carrytransverse waves. If the station is opposite the source, transverse waves stillarrive, but the timing is not right. What happens is that the transverse wavecomes to the core, and whenever the transverse waves come to a surface whichis oblique, between two materials, two new waves are generated, one transverseand one longitudinal. But inside the core of the earth, a transverse wave is notpropagated (or at least, there is no evidence for it, only for a longitudinal wave);it comes out again in both forms and comes to the station.

It is from the behavior of these earthquake waves that it has been determinedthat transverse waves cannot be propagated within the inner circle. This meansthat the center of the earth is liquid in the sense that it cannot propagatetransverse waves. The only way we know what is inside the earth is by studyingearthquakes. So, by using a large number of observations of many earthquakesat diﬀerent stations, the details have been worked out—the speed, the curves,

51-10

etc. are all known. We know what the speeds of various kinds of waves areat every depth. Knowing that, therefore, it is possible to ﬁgure out what thenormal modes of the earth are, because we know the speed of propagation ofsound waves—in other words, the elastic properties of both kinds of waves atevery depth. Suppose the earth were distorted into an ellipsoid and let go. It isjust a matter of superposing waves travelling around in the ellipsoid to determinethe period and shapes in a free mode. We have ﬁgured out that if there is adisturbance, there are a lot of modes, from the lowest, which is ellipsoidal, tohigher modes with more structure.

The Chilean earthquake of May 1960 made a loud enough「noise」that thesignals went around the earth many times, and new seismographs of great delicacywere made just in time to determine the frequencies of the fundamental modesof the earth and to compare them with the values that were calculated from thetheory of sound with the known velocities, as measured from the independentearthquakes. The result of this experiment is illustrated in Fig. 51-7, which is aplot of the strength of the signal versus the frequency of its oscillation (a Fourieranalysis). Note that at certain particular frequencies there is much more beingreceived than at other frequencies; there are very deﬁnite maxima. These arethe natural frequencies of the earth, because these are the main frequencies atwhich the earth can oscillate. In other words, if the entire motion of the earth ismade up of many diﬀerent modes, we would expect to obtain, for each station,

Fig. 51-7. Power versus frequency as detected at seismographs inÑaña, Peru, and Isabella, California. The coherence is a measure ofthe coupling between the stations. [From Benioﬀ, Press and Smith, J.Geoph. Research 66, 605 (1961)].

51-11

irregular bumpings which indicate a superposition of many frequencies. If weanalyze this in terms of frequencies, we should be able to ﬁnd the characteristicfrequencies of the earth. The vertical dark lines in the ﬁgure are the calculatedfrequencies, and we ﬁnd a remarkable agreement, an agreement due to the factthat the theory of sound is right for the inside of the earth.

Fig. 51-8. High-resolution analysis of one of the seismograph records,

showing spectral doublet.

A very curious point is revealed in Fig. 51-8, which shows a very carefulmeasurement, with better resolution of the lowest mode, the ellipsoidal mode ofthe earth. Note that it is not a single maximum, but a double one, 54.7 minutesand 53.1 minutes—slightly diﬀerent. The reason for the two diﬀerent frequencieswas not known at the time that it was measured, although it may have beenfound in the meantime. There are at least two possible explanations: One wouldbe that there may be asymmetry in the earth’s distribution, which would resultin two similar modes. Another possibility, which is even more interesting, is this:Imagine the waves going around the earth in two directions from the source.The speeds will not be equal because of eﬀects of the rotation of the earth in

51-12

the equations of motion, which have not been taken into account in making theanalysis. Motion in a rotating system is modiﬁed by Coriolis forces, and thesemay cause the observed splitting.

Regarding the method by which these quakes have been analyzed, what isobtained on the seismograph is not a curve of amplitude as a function of frequency,but displacement as a function of time, always a very irregular tracing. To ﬁndthe amount of all the diﬀerent sine waves for all diﬀerent frequencies, we knowthat the trick is to multiply the data by a sine wave of a given frequency andintegrate, i.e., average it, and in the average all other frequencies disappear. Theﬁgures were thus plots of the integrals found when the data were multiplied bysine waves of diﬀerent cycles per minute, and integrated.

51-4 Surface wavesNow, the next waves of interest, that are easily seen by everyone and whichare usually used as an example of waves in elementary courses, are water waves.As we shall soon see, they are the worst possible example, because they are inno respects like sound and light; they have all the complications that waves canhave. Let us start with long water waves in deep water. If the ocean is consideredinﬁnitely deep and a disturbance is made on the surface, waves are generated. Allkinds of irregular motions occur, but the sinusoidal type motion, with a very smalldisturbance, might look like the common smooth ocean waves coming in towardthe shore. Now with such a wave, the water, of course, on the average, is standingstill, but the wave moves. What is the motion, is it transverse or longitudinal? Itmust be neither; it is not transverse, nor is it longitudinal. Although the waterat a given place is alternately trough or hill, it cannot simply be moving up anddown, by the conservation of water. That is, if it goes down, where is the watergoing to go? The water is essentially incompressible. The speed of compressionof waves—that is, sound in the water—is much, much higher, and we are notconsidering that now. Since water is incompressible on this scale, as a hill comesdown the water must move away from the region. What actually happens is thatparticles of water near the surface move approximately in circles. When smoothswells are coming, a person ﬂoating in a tire can look at a nearby object andsee it going in a circle. So it is a mixture of longitudinal and transverse, to addto the confusion. At greater depths in the water the motions are smaller circlesuntil, reasonably far down, there is nothing left of the motion (Fig. 51-9).

51-13

Fig. 51-9. Deep-water waves are formed from particles moving incircles. Note the systematic phase shifts from circle to circle. Howwould a ﬂoating object move?

To ﬁnd the velocity of such waves is an interesting problem: it must be somecombination of the density of the water, the acceleration of gravity, which is therestoring force that makes the waves, and possibly of the wavelength and of thedepth. If we take the case where the depth goes to inﬁnity, it will no longerdepend on the depth. Whatever formula we are going to get for the velocity ofthe phases of the waves must combine the various factors to make the properdimensions, and if we try this in various ways, we ﬁnd only one way to combinethe density, g, and λ in order to make a velocity, namely, √gλ, which does notinclude the density at all. Actually, this formula for the phase velocity is notexactly right, but a complete analysis of the dynamics, which we will not go into,shows that the factors are as we have them, except for √2π:vphase =pgλ/2π (for gravity waves).

It is interesting that the long waves go faster than the short waves. Thus if aboat makes waves far out, because there is some sports-car driver in a motorboattravelling by, then after a while the waves come to shore with slow sloshings atﬁrst and then more and more rapid sloshings, because the ﬁrst waves that comeare long. The waves get shorter and shorter as the time goes on, because thevelocities go as the square root of the wavelength.

One may object,「That is not right, we must look at the group velocity inorder to ﬁgure it out!」Of course that is true. The formula for the phase velocitydoes not tell us what is going to arrive ﬁrst; what tells us is the group velocity.So we have to work out the group velocity, and it is left as a problem to showit to be one-half of the phase velocity, assuming that the velocity goes as thesquare root of the wavelength, which is all that is needed. The group velocityalso goes as the square root of the wavelength. How can the group velocity go

51-14

half as fast as the phase? If one looks at the bunch of waves that are made by aboat travelling along, following a particular crest, he ﬁnds that it moves forwardin the group and gradually gets weaker and dies out in the front, and mysticallyand mysteriously a weak one in the back works its way forward and gets stronger.In short, the waves are moving through the group while the group is only movingat half the speed that the waves are moving.

Fig. 51-10. The wake of a boat.

Because the group velocities and phase velocities are not equal, then thewaves that are produced by an object moving through are no longer simply acone, but it is much more interesting. We can see that in Fig. 51-10, whichshows the waves produced by an object moving through the water. Note that itis quite diﬀerent than what we would have for sound, in which the velocity isindependent of wavelength, where we would have wavefronts only along the cone,travelling outward. Instead of that, we have waves in the back with fronts movingparallel to the motion of the boat, and then we have little waves on the sides atother angles. This entire pattern of waves can, with ingenuity, be analyzed by

51-15

knowing only this: that the phase velocity is proportional to the square root ofthe wavelength. The trick is that the pattern of waves is stationary relative tothe (constant-velocity) boat; any other pattern would get lost from the boat.

The water waves that we have been considering so far were long waves inwhich the force of restoration is due to gravitation. But when waves get veryshort in the water, the main restoring force is capillary attraction, i.e., the energyof the surface, the surface tension. For surface tension waves, it turns out thatthe phase velocity is

vphase =p2πT /λρ (for ripples),

where T is the surface tension and ρ the density. It is the exact opposite: thephase velocity is higher, the shorter the wavelength, when the wavelength getsvery small. When we have both gravity and capillary action, as we always do,we get the combination of these two together:

vphase =pT k/ρ + g/k,

where k = 2π/λ is the wave number. So the velocity of the waves of water is reallyquite complicated. The phase velocity as a function of the wavelength is shownin Fig. 51-11; for very short waves it is fast, for very long waves it is fast, andthere is a minimum speed at which the waves can go. The group velocity can be

Fig. 51-11. Phase velocity vs. wavelength for water.

51-16

2 the phase velocity for ripples and 1

calculated from the formula: it goes to 32 thephase velocity for gravity waves. To the left of the minimum the group velocityis higher than the phase velocity; to the right, the group velocity is less than thephase velocity. There are a number of interesting phenomena associated withthese facts. In the ﬁrst place, since the group velocity is increasing so rapidly asthe wavelength goes down, if we make a disturbance there will be a slowest end ofthe disturbance going at the minimum speed with the corresponding wavelength,and then in front, going at higher speed, will be a short wave and a very longwave. It is very hard to see the long ones, but it is easy to see the short ones ina water tank.

So we see that the ripples often used to illustrate simple waves are quiteinteresting and complicated; they do not have a sharp wavefront at all, as is thecase for simple waves like sound and light. The main wave has little ripples whichrun out ahead. A sharp disturbance in the water does not produce a sharp wavebecause of the dispersion. First come the very ﬁne waves. Incidentally, if anobject moves through the water at a certain speed, a rather complicated patternresults, because all the diﬀerent waves are going at diﬀerent speeds. One candemonstrate this with a tray of water and see that the fastest ones are the ﬁnecapillary waves. There are slowest waves, of a certain kind, which go behind. Byinclining the bottom, one sees that where the depth is lower, the speed is lower.If a wave comes in at an angle to the line of maximum slope, it bends and tendsto follow that line. In this way one can show various things, and we concludethat waves are more complicated in water than in air.

The speed of long waves in water with circulational motions is slower whenthe depth is less, faster in deep water. Thus as water comes toward a beachwhere the depth lessens, the waves go slower. But where the water is deeper, thewaves are faster, so we get the eﬀects of shock waves. This time, since the waveis not so simple, the shocks are much more contorted, and the wave over-curvesitself, in the familiar way shown in Fig. 51-12. This is what happens when wavescome into the shore, and the real complexities in nature are well revealed in sucha circumstance. No one has yet been able to ﬁgure out what shape the waveshould take as it breaks. It is easy enough when the waves are small, but whenone gets large and breaks, then it is much more complicated.

An interesting feature about capillary waves can be seen in the disturbancesmade by an object moving through the water. From the point of view of theobject itself, the water is ﬂowing past, and the waves which ultimately sit aroundit are always the waves which have just the right speed to stay still with the

51-17

Fig. 51-12. A water wave.

object in the water. Similarly, around an object in a stream, with the streamﬂowing by, the pattern of waves is stationary, and at just the right wavelengths togo at the same speed as the water going by. But if the group velocity is less thanthe phase velocity, then the disturbances propagate out backwards in the stream,because the group velocity is not quite enough to keep up with the stream. Ifthe group velocity is faster than the velocity of the phase, the pattern of waveswill appear in front of the object. If one looks closely at objects in a stream, onecan see that there are little ripples in front and long「slurps」in the back.

Another interesting feature of this sort can be observed in pouring liquids. Ifmilk is poured fast enough out of a bottle, for instance, a large number of linescan be seen crossing both ways in the outgoing stream. They are waves startingfrom the disturbance at the edges and running out, much like the waves about anobject in a stream. There are eﬀects from both sides which produce the crossedpattern.

We have investigated some of the interesting properties of waves and thevarious complications of dependence of phase velocity on wavelength, the speed ofthe waves on depth, and so forth, that produce the really complex, and thereforeinteresting, phenomena of nature.
