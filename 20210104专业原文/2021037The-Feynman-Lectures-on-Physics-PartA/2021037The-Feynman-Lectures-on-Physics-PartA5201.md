Symmetry in Physical Laws

52-1 Symmetry operationsThe subject of this chapter is what we may call symmetry in physical laws. Wehave already discussed certain features of symmetry in physical laws in connectionwith vector analysis (Chapter 11), the theory of relativity (Chapter 16), androtation (Chapter 20).

Why should we be concerned with symmetry? In the ﬁrst place, symmetry isfascinating to the human mind, and everyone likes objects or patterns that are insome way symmetrical. It is an interesting fact that nature often exhibits certainkinds of symmetry in the objects we ﬁnd in the world around us. Perhaps themost symmetrical object imaginable is a sphere, and nature is full of spheres—stars, planets, water droplets in clouds. The crystals found in rocks exhibit manydiﬀerent kinds of symmetry, the study of which tells us some important thingsabout the structure of solids. Even the animal and vegetable worlds show somedegree of symmetry, although the symmetry of a ﬂower or of a bee is not asperfect or as fundamental as is that of a crystal.

But our main concern here is not with the fact that the objects of natureare often symmetrical. Rather, we wish to examine some of the even moreremarkable symmetries of the universe—the symmetries that exist in the basiclaws themselves which govern the operation of the physical world.First, what is symmetry? How can a physical law be「symmetrical」? Theproblem of deﬁning symmetry is an interesting one and we have already notedthat Weyl gave a good deﬁnition, the substance of which is that a thing issymmetrical if there is something we can do to it so that after we have done it,it looks the same as it did before. For example, a symmetrical vase is of sucha kind that if we reﬂect or turn it, it will look the same as it did before. Thequestion we wish to consider here is what we can do to physical phenomena, orto a physical situation in an experiment, and yet leave the result the same. Alist of the known operations under which various physical phenomena remaininvariant is shown in Table 52-1.

52-2 Symmetry in space and timeThe ﬁrst thing we might try to do, for example, is to translate the phenomenonin space. If we do an experiment in a certain region, and then build anotherapparatus at another place in space (or move the original one over) then, whateverwent on in one apparatus, in a certain order in time, will occur in the same wayif we have arranged the same condition, with all due attention to the restrictionsthat we mentioned before: that all of those features of the environment whichmake it not behave the same way have also been moved over—we talked abouthow to deﬁne how much we should include in those circumstances, and we shallnot go into those details again.

In the same way, we also believe today that displacement in time will haveno eﬀect on physical laws. (That is, as far as we know today—all of these thingsare as far as we know today!) That means that if we build a certain apparatusand start it at a certain time, say on Thursday at 10:00 a.m., and then buildthe same apparatus and start it, say, three days later in the same condition, thetwo apparatuses will go through the same motions in exactly the same way asa function of time no matter what the starting time, provided again, of course,that the relevant features of the environment are also modiﬁed appropriately intime. That symmetry means, of course, that if one bought General Motors stockthree months ago, the same thing would happen to it if he bought it now!

52-2

We have to watch out for geographical diﬀerences too, for there are, of course,variations in the characteristics of the earth’s surface. So, for example, if wemeasure the magnetic ﬁeld in a certain region and move the apparatus to someother region, it may not work in precisely the same way because the magneticﬁeld is diﬀerent, but we say that is because the magnetic ﬁeld is associated withthe earth. We can imagine that if we move the whole earth and the equipment,it would make no diﬀerence in the operation of the apparatus.

Another thing that we discussed in considerable detail was rotation in space:if we turn an apparatus at an angle it works just as well, provided we turneverything else that is relevant along with it. In fact, we discussed the problem ofsymmetry under rotation in space in some detail in Chapter 11, and we inventeda mathematical system called vector analysis to handle it as neatly as possible.On a more advanced level we had another symmetry—the symmetry underuniform velocity in a straight line. That is to say—a rather remarkable eﬀect—that if we have a piece of apparatus working a certain way and then take thesame apparatus and put it in a car, and move the whole car, plus all the relevantsurroundings, at a uniform velocity in a straight line, then so far as the phenomenainside the car are concerned there is no diﬀerence: all the laws of physics appearthe same. We even know how to express this more technically, and that is that themathematical equations of the physical laws must be unchanged under a Lorentztransformation. As a matter of fact, it was a study of the relativity problem thatconcentrated physicists’ attention most sharply on symmetry in physical laws.Now the above-mentioned symmetries have all been of a geometrical nature,time and space being more or less the same, but there are other symmetries of adiﬀerent kind. For example, there is a symmetry which describes the fact thatwe can replace one atom by another of the same kind; to put it diﬀerently, thereare atoms of the same kind. It is possible to ﬁnd groups of atoms such that if wechange a pair around, it makes no diﬀerence—the atoms are identical. Whateverone atom of oxygen of a certain type will do, another atom of oxygen of that typewill do. One may say,「That is ridiculous, that is the deﬁnition of equal types!」That may be merely the deﬁnition, but then we still do not know whether thereare any「atoms of the same type」; the fact is that there are many, many atoms ofthe same type. Thus it does mean something to say that it makes no diﬀerenceif we replace one atom by another of the same type. The so-called elementaryparticles of which the atoms are made are also identical particles in the abovesense—all electrons are the same; all protons are the same; all positive pions arethe same; and so on.

52-3

After such a long list of things that can be done without changing thephenomena, one might think we could do practically anything; so let us givesome examples to the contrary, just to see the diﬀerence. Suppose that we ask:「Are the physical laws symmetrical under a change of scale?」Suppose we build acertain piece of apparatus, and then build another apparatus ﬁve times bigger inevery part, will it work exactly the same way? The answer is, in this case, no!The wavelength of light emitted, for example, by the atoms inside one box ofsodium atoms and the wavelength of light emitted by a gas of sodium atoms ﬁvetimes in volume is not ﬁve times longer, but is in fact exactly the same as theother. So the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the emitter will change.

Another example: we see in the newspaper, every once in a while picturesof a great cathedral made with little matchsticks—a tremendous work of artby some retired fellow who keeps gluing matchsticks together. It is much moreelaborate and wonderful than any real cathedral. If we imagine that this woodencathedral were actually built on the scale of a real cathedral, we see where thetrouble is; it would not last—the whole thing would collapse because of the factthat scaled-up matchsticks are just not strong enough.「Yes,」one might say,「but we also know that when there is an inﬂuence from the outside, it also mustbe changed in proportion!」We are talking about the ability of the object towithstand gravitation. So what we should do is ﬁrst to take the model cathedralof real matchsticks and the real earth, and then we know it is stable. Then weshould take the larger cathedral and take a bigger earth. But then it is evenworse, because the gravitation is increased still more!

Today, of course, we understand the fact that phenomena depend on thescale on the grounds that matter is atomic in nature, and certainly if we built anapparatus that was so small there were only ﬁve atoms in it, it would clearly besomething we could not scale up and down arbitrarily. The scale of an individualatom is not at all arbitrary—it is quite deﬁnite.

The fact that the laws of physics are not unchanged under a change of scalewas discovered by Galileo. He realized that the strengths of materials were notin exactly the right proportion to their sizes, and he illustrated this propertythat we were just discussing, about the cathedral of matchsticks, by drawing twobones, the bone of one dog, in the right proportion for holding up his weight,and the imaginary bone of a「super dog」that would be, say, ten or a hundredtimes bigger—that bone was a big, solid thing with quite diﬀerent proportions.We do not know whether he ever carried the argument quite to the conclusionthat the laws of nature must have a deﬁnite scale, but he was so impressed with

52-4

this discovery that he considered it to be as important as the discovery of thelaws of motion, because he published them both in the same volume, called「OnTwo New Sciences.」

Another example in which the laws are not symmetrical, that we know quitewell, is this: a system in rotation at a uniform angular velocity does not give thesame apparent laws as one that is not rotating. If we make an experiment and thenput everything in a space ship and have the space ship spinning in empty space,all alone at a constant angular velocity, the apparatus will not work the same waybecause, as we know, things inside the equipment will be thrown to the outside,and so on, by the centrifugal or Coriolis forces, etc. In fact, we can tell that theearth is rotating by using a so-called Foucault pendulum, without looking outside.Next we mention a very interesting symmetry which is obviously false, i.e.,reversibility in time. The physical laws apparently cannot be reversible in time,because, as we know, all obvious phenomena are irreversible on a large scale:「The moving ﬁnger writes, and having writ, moves on.」So far as we can tell, thisirreversibility is due to the very large number of particles involved, and if wecould see the individual molecules, we would not be able to discern whether themachinery was working forward or backwards. To make it more precise: we builda small apparatus in which we know what all the atoms are doing, in which wecan watch them jiggling. Now we build another apparatus like it, but which startsits motion in the ﬁnal condition of the other one, with all the velocities preciselyreversed. It will then go through the same motions, but exactly in reverse. Puttingit another way: if we take a motion picture, with suﬃcient detail, of all the innerworks of a piece of material and shine it on a screen and run it backwards, nophysicist will be able to say,「That is against the laws of physics, that is doingsomething wrong!」If we do not see all the details, of course, the situation will beperfectly clear. If we see the egg splattering on the sidewalk and the shell crackingopen, and so on, then we will surely say,「That is irreversible, because if we run themoving picture backwards the egg will all collect together and the shell will go backtogether, and that is obviously ridiculous!」But if we look at the individual atomsthemselves, the laws look completely reversible. This is, of course, a much harderdiscovery to have made, but apparently it is true that the fundamental physicallaws, on a microscopic and fundamental level, are completely reversible in time!

52-3 Symmetry and conservation lawsThe symmetries of the physical laws are very interesting at this level, but theyturn out, in the end, to be even more interesting and exciting when we come to

52-5

quantum mechanics. For a reason which we cannot make clear at the level of thepresent discussion—a fact that most physicists still ﬁnd somewhat staggering, amost profound and beautiful thing, is that, in quantum mechanics, for each of therules of symmetry there is a corresponding conservation law; there is a deﬁniteconnection between the laws of conservation and the symmetries of physical laws.We can only state this at present, without any attempt at explanation.

The fact, for example, that the laws are symmetrical for translation in spacewhen we add the principles of quantum mechanics, turns out to mean thatmomentum is conserved.

That the laws are symmetrical under translation in time means, in quantum

mechanics, that energy is conserved.

Invariance under rotation through a ﬁxed angle in space corresponds to theconservation of angular momentum. These connections are very interesting andbeautiful things, among the most beautiful and profound things in physics.

Incidentally, there are a number of symmetries which appear in quantummechanics which have no classical analog, which have no method of descriptionin classical physics. One of these is as follows: If ψ is the amplitude for someprocess or other, we know that the absolute square of ψ is the probability thatthe process will occur. Now if someone else were to make his calculations, notwith this ψ, but with a ψ0 which diﬀers merely by a change in phase (let ∆ besome constant, and multiply ei∆ times the old ψ), the absolute square of ψ0,which is the probability of the event, is then equal to the absolute square of ψ:(52.1)

|ψ0|2 = |ψ|2.

ψ0 = ψei∆;

Therefore the physical laws are unchanged if the phase of the wave functionis shifted by an arbitrary constant. That is another symmetry. Physical lawsmust be of such a nature that a shift in the quantum-mechanical phase makesno diﬀerence. As we have just mentioned, in quantum mechanics there is aconservation law for every symmetry. The conservation law which is connectedwith the quantum-mechanical phase seems to be the conservation of electricalcharge. This is altogether a very interesting business!

52-4 Mirror reﬂectionsNow the next question, which is going to concern us for most of the rest ofthis chapter, is the question of symmetry under reﬂection in space. The problem

52-6

is this: Are the physical laws symmetrical under reﬂection? We may put it thisway: Suppose we build a piece of equipment, let us say a clock, with lots ofwheels and hands and numbers; it ticks, it works, and it has things wound upinside. We look at the clock in the mirror. How it looks in the mirror is not thequestion. But let us actually build another clock which is exactly the same asthe ﬁrst clock looks in the mirror—every time there is a screw with a right-handthread in one, we use a screw with a left-hand thread in the correspondingplace of the other; where one is marked「2」on the face, we mark a「2」onthe face of the other; each coiled spring is twisted one way in one clock andthe other way in the mirror-image clock; when we are all ﬁnished, we have twoclocks, both physical, which bear to each other the relation of an object and itsmirror image, although they are both actual, material objects, we emphasize.Now the question is: If the two clocks are started in the same condition, thesprings wound to corresponding tightnesses, will the two clocks tick and goaround, forever after, as exact mirror images? (This is a physical question, nota philosophical question.) Our intuition about the laws of physics would suggestthat they would.We would suspect that, at least in the case of these clocks, reﬂection in spaceis one of the symmetries of physical laws, that if we change everything from「right」to「left」and leave it otherwise the same, we cannot tell the diﬀerence. Letus, then, suppose for a moment that this is true. If it is true, then it would beimpossible to distinguish「right」and「left」by any physical phenomenon, just asit is, for example, impossible to deﬁne a particular absolute velocity by a physicalphenomenon. So it should be impossible, by any physical phenomenon, to deﬁneabsolutely what we mean by「right」as opposed to「left,」because the physicallaws should be symmetrical.

Of course, the world does not have to be symmetrical. For example, usingwhat we may call「geography,」surely「right」can be deﬁned. For instance, westand in New Orleans and look at Chicago, and Florida is to our right (when ourfeet are on the ground!). So we can deﬁne「right」and「left」by geography. Ofcourse, the actual situation in any system does not have to have the symmetrythat we are talking about; it is a question of whether the laws are symmetrical—inother words, whether it is against the physical laws to have a sphere like theearth with「left-handed dirt」on it and a person like ourselves standing lookingat a city like Chicago from a place like New Orleans, but with everything theother way around, so Florida is on the other side. It clearly seems not impossible,not against the physical laws, to have everything changed left for right.

52-7

Another point is that our deﬁnition of「right」should not depend on history.An easy way to distinguish right from left is to go to a machine shop and pickup a screw at random. The odds are it has a right-hand thread—not necessarily,but it is much more likely to have a right-hand thread than a left-hand one. Thisis a question of history or convention, or the way things happen to be, and isagain not a question of fundamental laws. As we can well appreciate, everyonecould have started out making left-handed screws!

So we must try to ﬁnd some phenomenon in which「right hand」is involvedfundamentally. The next possibility we discuss is the fact that polarized lightrotates its plane of polarization as it goes through, say, sugar water. As we sawin Chapter 33, it rotates, let us say, to the right in a certain sugar solution. Thatis a way of deﬁning「right-hand,」because we may dissolve some sugar in thewater and then the polarization goes to the right. But sugar has come from livingthings, and if we try to make the sugar artiﬁcially, then we discover that it doesnot rotate the plane of polarization! But if we then take that same sugar whichis made artiﬁcially and which does not rotate the plane of polarization, and putbacteria in it (they eat some of the sugar) and then ﬁlter out the bacteria, weﬁnd that we still have sugar left (almost half as much as we had before), and thistime it does rotate the plane of polarization, but the other way! It seems veryconfusing, but is easily explained.Take another example: One of the substances which is common to all livingcreatures and that is fundamental to life is protein. Proteins consist of chains ofamino acids. Figure 52-1 shows a model of an amino acid that comes out of aprotein. This amino acid is called alanine, and the molecular arrangement wouldlook like that in Fig. 52-1(a) if it came out of a protein of a real living thing.On the other hand, if we try to make alanine from carbon dioxide, ethane, andammonia (and we can make it, it is not a complicated molecule), we discover thatwe are making equal amounts of this molecule and the one shown in Fig. 52-1(b)!The ﬁrst molecule, the one that comes from the living thing, is called L-alanine.The other one, which is the same chemically, in that it has the same kinds of atomsand the same connections of the atoms, is a「right-hand」molecule, comparedwith the「left-hand」L-alanine, and it is called D-alanine. The interesting thing isthat when we make alanine at home in a laboratory from simple gases, we get anequal mixture of both kinds. However, the only thing that life uses is L-alanine.(This is not exactly true. Here and there in living creatures there is a special usefor D-alanine, but it is very rare. All proteins use L-alanine exclusively.) Nowif we make both kinds, and we feed the mixture to some animal which likes to

52-8

Fig. 52-1. (a) L-alanine (left), and (b) D-alanine (right).

「eat,」or use up, alanine, it cannot use D-alanine, so it only uses the L-alanine;that is what happened to our sugar—after the bacteria eat the sugar that workswell for them, only the「wrong」kind is left! (Left-handed sugar tastes sweet, butnot the same as right-handed sugar.)

So it looks as though the phenomena of life permit a distinction between「right」and「left,」or chemistry permits a distinction, because the two moleculesare chemically diﬀerent. But no, it does not! So far as physical measurements canbe made, such as of energy, the rates of chemical reactions, and so on, the twokinds work exactly the same way if we make everything else in a mirror imagetoo. One molecule will rotate light to the right, and the other will rotate it tothe left in precisely the same amount, through the same amount of ﬂuid. Thus,so far as physics is concerned, these two amino acids are equally satisfactory. Sofar as we understand things today, the fundamentals of the Schrödinger equationhave it that the two molecules should behave in exactly corresponding ways, sothat one is to the right as the other is to the left. Nevertheless, in life it is allone way!

It is presumed that the reason for this is the following. Let us suppose, forexample, that life is somehow at one moment in a certain condition in whichall the proteins in some creatures have left-handed amino acids, and all theenzymes are lopsided—every substance in the living creature is lopsided—it isnot symmetrical. So when the digestive enzymes try to change the chemicals inthe food from one kind to another, one kind of chemical「ﬁts」into the enzyme,but the other kind does not (like Cinderella and the slipper, except that it is a

52-9

「left foot」that we are testing). So far as we know, in principle, we could builda frog, for example, in which every molecule is reversed, everything is like the「left-hand」mirror image of a real frog; we have a left-hand frog. This left-handfrog would go on all right for a while, but he would ﬁnd nothing to eat, becauseif he swallows a ﬂy, his enzymes are not built to digest it. The ﬂy has the wrong「kind」of amino acids (unless we give him a left-hand ﬂy). So as far as we know,the chemical and life processes would continue in the same manner if everythingwere reversed.

If life is entirely a physical and chemical phenomenon, then we can understandthat the proteins are all made in the same corkscrew only from the idea thatat the very beginning some living molecules, by accident, got started and a fewwon. Somewhere, once, one organic molecule was lopsided in a certain way,and from this particular thing the「right」happened to evolve in our particulargeography; a particular historical accident was one-sided, and ever since then thelopsidedness has propagated itself. Once having arrived at the state that it is innow, of course, it will always continue—all the enzymes digest the right things,manufacture the right things: when the carbon dioxide and the water vapor,and so on, go in the plant leaves, the enzymes that make the sugars make themlopsided because the enzymes are lopsided. If any new kind of virus or livingthing were to originate at a later time, it would survive only if it could「eat」thekind of living matter already present. Thus it, too, must be of the same kind.There is no conservation of the number of right-handed molecules. Oncestarted, we could keep increasing the number of right-handed molecules. So thepresumption is, then, that the phenomena in the case of life do not show a lackof symmetry in physical laws, but do show, on the contrary, the universal natureand the commonness of ultimate origin of all creatures on earth, in the sensedescribed above.

52-5 Polar and axial vectorsNow we go further. We observe that in physics there are a lot of other placeswhere we have「right」and「left」hand rules. As a matter of fact, when welearned about vector analysis we learned about the right-hand rules we have touse in order to get the angular momentum, torque, magnetic ﬁeld, and so on, tocome out right. The force on a charge moving in a magnetic ﬁeld, for example,is F = qv × B. In a given situation, in which we know F , v, and B, isn’t thatequation enough to deﬁne right-handedness? As a matter of fact, if we go back

52-10

and look at where the vectors came from, we know that the「right-hand rule」was merely a convention; it was a trick. The original quantities, like the angularmomenta and the angular velocities, and things of this kind, were not reallyvectors at all! They are all somehow associated with a certain plane, and it is justbecause there are three dimensions in space that we can associate the quantitywith a direction perpendicular to that plane. Of the two possible directions, wechose the「right-hand」direction.

So if the laws of physics are symmetrical, we should ﬁnd that if some demonwere to sneak into all the physics laboratories and replace the word「right」for「left」in every book in which「right-hand rules」are given, and instead we were touse all「left-hand rules,」uniformly, then it should make no diﬀerence whateverin the physical laws.

Fig. 52-2. A step in space and its mirror image.

Let us give an illustration. There are two kinds of vectors. There are「honest」vectors, for example a step r in space. If in our apparatus there is a piece hereand something else there, then in a mirror apparatus there will be the imagepiece and the image something else, and if we draw a vector from the「piece」to the「something else,」one vector is the mirror image of the other (Fig. 52-2).The vector arrow changes its head, just as the whole space turns inside out; sucha vector we call a polar vector.

But the other kind of vector, which has to do with rotations, is of a diﬀerentnature. For example, suppose that in three dimensions something is rotatingas shown in Fig. 52-3. Then if we look at it in a mirror, it will be rotating asindicated, namely, as the mirror image of the original rotation. Now we haveagreed to represent the mirror rotation by the same rule, it is a「vector」which,on reﬂection, does not change about as the polar vector does, but is reversedrelative to the polar vectors and to the geometry of the space; such a vector iscalled an axial vector.

Now if the law of reﬂection symmetry is right in physics, then it must be truethat the equations must be so designed that if we change the sign of each axial

52-11

Fig. 52-3. A rotating wheel and its mirror image. Note that the

angular velocity「vector」is not reversed in direction.

vector and each cross-product of vectors, which would be what corresponds toreﬂection, nothing will happen. For instance, when we write a formula which saysthat the angular momentum is L = r × p, that equation is all right, because if wechange to a left-hand coordinate system, we change the sign of L, but p and rdo not change; the cross-product sign is changed, since we must change from aright-hand rule to a left-hand rule. As another example, we know that the forceon a charge moving in a magnetic ﬁeld is F = qv × B, but if we change from aright- to a left-handed system, since F and v are known to be polar vectors thesign change required by the cross-product must be cancelled by a sign changein B, which means that B must be an axial vector. In other words, if we makesuch a reﬂection, B must go to −B. So if we change our coordinates from rightto left, we must also change the poles of magnets from north to south.Let us see how that works in an example. Suppose that we have two magnets,as in Fig. 52-4. One is a magnet with the coils going around a certain way, andwith current in a given direction. The other magnet looks like the reﬂectionof the ﬁrst magnet in a mirror—the coil will wind the other way, everythingthat happens inside the coil is exactly reversed, and the current goes as shown.Now, from the laws for the production of magnetic ﬁelds, which we do not knowyet oﬃcially, but which we most likely learned in high school, it turns out that

Fig. 52-4. A magnet and its mirror image.

52-12

the magnetic ﬁeld is as shown in the ﬁgure. In one case the pole is a southmagnetic pole, while in the other magnet the current is going the other way andthe magnetic ﬁeld is reversed—it is a north magnetic pole. So we see that whenwe go from right to left we must indeed change from north to south!

Never mind changing north to south; these too are mere conventions. Let ustalk about phenomena. Suppose, now, that we have an electron moving throughone ﬁeld, going into the page. Then, if we use the formula for the force, v × B(remember the charge is minus), we ﬁnd that the electron will deviate in theindicated direction according to the physical law. So the phenomenon is that wehave a coil with a current going in a speciﬁed sense and an electron curves in acertain way—that is the physics—never mind how we label everything.

Now let us do the same experiment with a mirror: we send an electron throughin a corresponding direction and now the force is reversed, if we calculate it fromthe same rule, and that is very good because the corresponding motions are thenmirror images!

52-6 Which hand is right?So the fact of the matter is that in studying any phenomenon there are alwaystwo right-hand rules, or an even number of them, and the net result is that thephenomena always look symmetrical. In short, therefore, we cannot tell rightfrom left if we also are not able to tell north from south. However, it may seemthat we can tell the north pole of a magnet. The north pole of a compass needle,for example, is one that points to the north. But of course that is again a localproperty that has to do with geography of the earth; that is just like talkingabout in which direction is Chicago, so it does not count. If we have seen compassneedles, we may have noticed that the north-seeking pole is a sort of bluish color.But that is just due to the man who painted the magnet. These are all local,conventional criteria.

However, if a magnet were to have the property that if we looked at it closelyenough we would see small hairs growing on its north pole but not on its southpole, if that were the general rule, or if there were any unique way to distinguishthe north from the south pole of a magnet, then we could tell which of the twocases we actually had, and that would be the end of the law of reﬂection symmetry.To illustrate the whole problem still more clearly, imagine that we were talkingto a Martian, or someone very far away, by telephone. We are not allowed tosend him any actual samples to inspect; for instance, if we could send light, we

52-13

could send him right-hand circularly polarized light and say,「That is right-handlight—just watch the way it is going.」But we cannot give him anything, we canonly talk to him. He is far away, or in some strange location, and he cannot seeanything we can see. For instance, we cannot say,「Look at Ursa major; nowsee how those stars are arranged. What we mean by ‘right’ is . . . 」We are onlyallowed to telephone him.

Now we want to tell him all about us. Of course, ﬁrst we start deﬁningnumbers, and say,「Tick, tick, two, tick, tick, tick, three, . . . ,」so that graduallyhe can understand a couple of words, and so on. After a while we may becomevery familiar with this fellow, and he says,「What do you guys look like?」We startto describe ourselves, and say,「Well, we are six feet tall.」He says,「Wait a minute,what is six feet?」Is it possible to tell him what six feet is? Certainly! We say,「Youknow about the diameter of hydrogen atoms—we are 17,000,000,000 hydrogenatoms high!」That is possible because physical laws are not invariant underchange of scale, and therefore we can deﬁne an absolute length. And so we deﬁnethe size of the body, and tell him what the general shape is—it has prongs withﬁve bumps sticking out on the ends, and so on, and he follows us along, and weﬁnish describing how we look on the outside, presumably without encounteringany particular diﬃculties. He is even making a model of us as we go along. Hesays,「My, you are certainly very handsome fellows; now what is on the inside?」So we start to describe the various organs on the inside, and we come to theheart, and we carefully describe the shape of it, and say,「Now put the heart onthe left side.」He says,「Duhhh—the left side?」Now our problem is to describeto him which side the heart goes on without his ever seeing anything that we see,and without our ever sending any sample to him of what we mean by「right」—nostandard right-handed object. Can we do it?

52-7 Parity is not conserved!It turns out that the laws of gravitation, the laws of electricity and magnetism,nuclear forces, all satisfy the principle of reﬂection symmetry, so these laws, oranything derived from them, cannot be used. But associated with the manyparticles that are found in nature there is a phenomenon called beta decay, or weakdecay. One of the examples of weak decay, in connection with a particle discoveredin about 1954, posed a strange puzzle. There was a certain charged particlewhich disintegrated into three π-mesons, as shown schematically in Fig. 52-5.This particle was called, for a while, a τ-meson. Now in Fig. 52-5 we also see

52-14

Fig. 52-5. A schematic diagram of the disintegration of a τ + and

a θ+ particle.

another particle which disintegrates into two mesons; one must be neutral, fromthe conservation of charge. This particle was called a θ-meson. So on the onehand we have a particle called a τ, which disintegrates into three π-mesons, anda θ, which disintegrates into two π-mesons. Now it was soon discovered thatthe τ and the θ are almost equal in mass; in fact, within the experimental error,they are equal. Next, the length of time it took for them to disintegrate intothree π’s and two π’s was found to be almost exactly the same; they live thesame length of time. Next, whenever they were made, they were made in thesame proportions, say, 14 percent τ’s to 86 percent θ’s.

Anyone in his right mind realizes immediately that they must be the sameparticle, that we merely produce an object which has two diﬀerent ways ofdisintegrating—not two diﬀerent particles. This object that can disintegrate intwo diﬀerent ways has, therefore, the same lifetime and the same productionratio (because this is simply the ratio of the odds with which it disintegrates intothese two kinds).

However, it was possible to prove (and we cannot here explain at all how),from the principle of reﬂection symmetry in quantum mechanics, that it wasimpossible to have these both come from the same particle—the same particlecould not disintegrate in both of these ways. The conservation law correspondingto the principle of reﬂection symmetry is something which has no classical analog,and so this kind of quantum-mechanical conservation was called the conservationof parity. So, it was a result of the conservation of parity or, more precisely, fromthe symmetry of the quantum-mechanical equations of the weak decays underreﬂection, that the same particle could not go into both, so it must be some kindof coincidence of masses, lifetimes, and so on. But the more it was studied, themore remarkable the coincidence, and the suspicion gradually grew that possiblythe deep law of the reﬂection symmetry of nature may be false.

As a result of this apparent failure, the physicists Lee and Yang suggestedthat other experiments be done in related decays to try to test whether the law

52-15

was correct in other cases. The ﬁrst such experiment was carried out by Miss Wufrom Columbia, and was done as follows. Using a very strong magnet at a verylow temperature, it turns out that a certain isotope of cobalt, which disintegratesby emitting an electron, is magnetic, and if the temperature is low enough thatthe thermal oscillations do not jiggle the atomic magnets about too much, theyline up in the magnetic ﬁeld. So the cobalt atoms will all line up in this strongﬁeld. They then disintegrate, emitting an electron, and it was discovered thatwhen the atoms were lined up in a ﬁeld whose B vector points upward, most ofthe electrons were emitted in a downward direction.If one is not really「hep」to the world, such a remark does not sound likeanything of signiﬁcance, but if one appreciates the problems and interestingthings in the world, then he sees that it is a most dramatic discovery: Whenwe put cobalt atoms in an extremely strong magnetic ﬁeld, more disintegrationelectrons go down than up. Therefore if we were to put it in a correspondingexperiment in a「mirror,」in which the cobalt atoms would be lined up in theopposite direction, they would spit their electrons up, not down; the action isunsymmetrical. The magnet has grown hairs! The south pole of a magnet is ofsuch a kind that the electrons in a β-disintegration tend to go away from it; thatdistinguishes, in a physical way, the north pole from the south pole.After this, a lot of other experiments were done: the disintegration of the πinto µ and ν; µ into an electron and two neutrinos; nowadays, the Λ into protonand π; disintegration of Σ’s; and many other disintegrations. In fact, in almostall cases where it could be expected, all have been found not to obey reﬂectionsymmetry! Fundamentally, the law of reﬂection symmetry, at this level in physics,is incorrect.

In short, we can tell a Martian where to put the heart: we say,「Listen, buildyourself a magnet, and put the coils in, and put the current on, and then takesome cobalt and lower the temperature. Arrange the experiment so the electronsgo from the foot to the head, then the direction in which the current goes throughthe coils is the direction that goes in on what we call the right and comes out onthe left.」So it is possible to deﬁne right and left, now, by doing an experiment ofthis kind.

There are a lot of other features that were predicted. For example, it turns outthat the spin, the angular momentum, of the cobalt nucleus before disintegrationis 5 units of , and after disintegration it is 4 units. The electron carries spinangular momentum, and there is also a neutrino involved. It is easy to see fromthis that the electron must carry its spin angular momentum aligned along its

52-16

direction of motion, the neutrino likewise. So it looks as though the electron isspinning to the left, and that was also checked. In fact, it was checked right hereat Caltech by Boehm and Wapstra, that the electrons spin mostly to the left.(There were some other experiments that gave the opposite answer, but theywere wrong!)

The next problem, of course, was to ﬁnd the law of the failure of parityconservation. What is the rule that tells us how strong the failure is going tobe? The rule is this: it occurs only in these very slow reactions, called weakdecays, and when it occurs, the rule is that the particles which carry spin, likethe electron, neutrino, and so on, come out with a spin tending to the left. Thatis a lopsided rule; it connects a polar vector velocity and an axial vector angularmomentum, and says that the angular momentum is more likely to be oppositeto the velocity than along it.

Now that is the rule, but today we do not really understand the whys andwherefores of it. Why is this the right rule, what is the fundamental reasonfor it, and how is it connected to anything else? At the moment we have beenso shocked by the fact that this thing is unsymmetrical that we have not beenable to recover enough to understand what it means with regard to all the otherrules. However, the subject is interesting, modern, and still unsolved, so it seemsappropriate that we discuss some of the questions associated with it.

52-8 AntimatterThe ﬁrst thing to do when one of the symmetries is lost is to immediately goback over the list of known or assumed symmetries and ask whether any of theothers are lost. Now we did not mention one operation on our list, which mustnecessarily be questioned, and that is the relation between matter and antimatter.Dirac predicted that in addition to electrons there must be another particle, calledthe positron (discovered at Caltech by Anderson), that is necessarily relatedto the electron. All the properties of these two particles obey certain rules ofcorrespondence: the energies are equal; the masses are equal; the charges arereversed; but, more important than anything, the two of them, when they cometogether, can annihilate each other and liberate their entire mass in the formof energy, say γ-rays. The positron is called an antiparticle to the electron,and these are the characteristics of a particle and its antiparticle. It was clearfrom Dirac’s argument that all the rest of the particles in the world should alsohave corresponding antiparticles. For instance, for the proton there should be an

52-17

antiproton, which is now symbolized by a p. The p would have a negative electricalcharge and the same mass as a proton, and so on. The most important feature,however, is that a proton and an antiproton coming together can annihilate eachother. The reason we emphasize this is that people do not understand it when wesay there is a neutron and also an antineutron, because they say,「A neutron isneutral, so how can it have the opposite charge?」The rule of the「anti」is not justthat it has the opposite charge, it has a certain set of properties, the whole lot ofwhich are opposite. The antineutron is distinguished from the neutron in this way:if we bring two neutrons together, they just stay as two neutrons, but if we bringa neutron and an antineutron together, they annihilate each other with a greatexplosion of energy being liberated, with various π-mesons, γ-rays, and whatnot.Now if we have antineutrons, antiprotons, and antielectrons, we can makeantiatoms, in principle. They have not been made yet, but it is possible inprinciple. For instance, a hydrogen atom has a proton in the center with anelectron going around outside. Now imagine that somewhere we can make anantiproton with a positron going around, would it go around? Well, ﬁrst of all,the antiproton is electrically negative and the antielectron is electrically positive,so they attract each other in a corresponding manner—the masses are all thesame; everything is the same. It is one of the principles of the symmetry ofphysics, the equations seem to show, that if a clock, say, were made of matter onone hand, and then we made the same clock of antimatter, it would run in thisway. (Of course, if we put the clocks together, they would annihilate each other,but that is diﬀerent.)

An immediate question then arises. We can build, out of matter, two clocks,one which is「left-hand」and one which is「right-hand.」For example, we couldbuild a clock which is not built in a simple way, but has cobalt and magnets andelectron detectors which detect the presence of β-decay electrons and count them.Each time one is counted, the second hand moves over. Then the mirror clock,receiving fewer electrons, will not run at the same rate. So evidently we canmake two clocks such that the left-hand clock does not agree with the right-handone. Let us make, out of matter, a clock which we call the standard or right-handclock. Now let us make, also out of matter, a clock which we call the left-handclock. We have just discovered that, in general, these two will not run the sameway; prior to that famous physical discovery, it was thought that they would.Now it was also supposed that matter and antimatter were equivalent. That is, ifwe made an antimatter clock, right-hand, the same shape, then it would run thesame as the right-hand matter clock, and if we made the same clock to the left it

52-18

would run the same. In other words, in the beginning it was believed that allfour of these clocks were the same; now of course we know that the right-handand left-hand matter are not the same. Presumably, therefore, the right-handedantimatter and the left-handed antimatter are not the same.

So the obvious question is, which goes with which, if either? In other words,does the right-handed matter behave the same way as the right-handed antimatter?Or does the right-handed matter behave the same as the left-handed antimatter?β-decay experiments, using positron decay instead of electron decay, indicatethat this is the interconnection: matter to the「right」works the same way asantimatter to the「left.」

Therefore, at long last, it is really true that right and left symmetry is stillmaintained! If we made a left-hand clock, but made it out of the other kind ofmatter, antimatter instead of matter, it would run in the same way. So what hashappened is that instead of having two independent rules in our list of symmetries,two of these rules go together to make a new rule, which says that matter to theright is symmetrical with antimatter to the left.

So if our Martian is made of antimatter and we give him instructions to makethis「right」handed model like us, it will, of course, come out the other wayaround. What would happen when, after much conversation back and forth, weeach have taught the other to make space ships and we meet halfway in emptyspace? We have instructed each other on our traditions, and so forth, and thetwo of us come rushing out to shake hands. Well, if he puts out his left hand,watch out!

52-9 Broken symmetriesThe next question is, what can we make out of laws which are nearly symmet-rical? The marvelous thing about it all is that for such a wide range of important,strong phenomena—nuclear forces, electrical phenomena, and even weak oneslike gravitation—over a tremendous range of physics, all the laws for these seemto be symmetrical. On the other hand, this little extra piece says,「No, the lawsare not symmetrical!」How is it that nature can be almost symmetrical, but notperfectly symmetrical? What shall we make of this? First, do we have any otherexamples? The answer is, we do, in fact, have a few other examples. For instance,the nuclear part of the force between proton and proton, between neutron andneutron, and between neutron and proton, is all exactly the same—there is asymmetry for nuclear forces, a new one, that we can interchange neutron andproton—but it evidently is not a general symmetry, for the electrical repulsion

52-19

between two protons at a distance does not exist for neutrons. So it is notgenerally true that we can always replace a proton with a neutron, but only to agood approximation. Why good? Because the nuclear forces are much strongerthan the electrical forces. So this is an「almost」symmetry also. So we do haveexamples in other things.

We have, in our minds, a tendency to accept symmetry as some kind ofperfection. In fact it is like the old idea of the Greeks that circles were perfect,and it was rather horrible to believe that the planetary orbits were not circles,but only nearly circles. The diﬀerence between being a circle and being nearlya circle is not a small diﬀerence, it is a fundamental change so far as the mindis concerned. There is a sign of perfection and symmetry in a circle that is notthere the moment the circle is slightly oﬀ—that is the end of it—it is no longersymmetrical. Then the question is why it is only nearly a circle—that is a muchmore diﬃcult question. The actual motion of the planets, in general, shouldbe ellipses, but during the ages, because of tidal forces, and so on, they havebeen made almost symmetrical. Now the question is whether we have a similarproblem here. The problem from the point of view of the circles is if they wereperfect circles there would be nothing to explain, that is clearly simple. But sincethey are only nearly circles, there is a lot to explain, and the result turned outto be a big dynamical problem, and now our problem is to explain why they arenearly symmetrical by looking at tidal forces and so on.
