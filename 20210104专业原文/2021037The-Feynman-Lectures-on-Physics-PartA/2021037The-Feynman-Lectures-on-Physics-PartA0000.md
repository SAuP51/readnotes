## About Richard Feynman

Born in 1918 in New York City, Richard P. Feynman received his Ph.D.from Princeton in 1942. Despite his youth, he played an important part in theManhattan Project at Los Alamos during World War II. Subsequently, he taught at Cornell and at the California Institute of Technology. In 1965 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger, forhis work in quantum electrodynamics.

Dr. Feynman won his Nobel Prize for successfully resolving problems with thetheory of quantum electrodynamics. He also created a mathematical theory thataccounts for the phenomenon of superﬂuidity in liquid helium. Thereafter, withMurray Gell-Mann, he did fundamental work in the area of weak interactions suchas beta decay. In later years Feynman played a key role in the development ofquark theory by putting forward his parton model of high energy proton collisionprocesses.

Beyond these achievements, Dr. Feynman introduced basic new computa-tional techniques and notations into physics — above all, the ubiquitous Feynmandiagrams that, perhaps more than any other formalism in recent scientiﬁc history,have changed the way in which basic physical processes are conceptualized andcalculated.

Feynman was a remarkably eﬀective educator. Of all his numerous awards,he was especially proud of the Oersted Medal for Teaching, which he won in1972. The Feynman Lectures on Physics, originally published in 1963, weredescribed by a reviewer in Scientiﬁc American as「tough, but nourishing and fullof ﬂavor. After 25 years it is the guide for teachers and for the best of beginningstudents.」In order to increase the understanding of physics among the lay public,Dr. Feynman wrote The Character of Physical Law and QED: The StrangeTheory of Light and Matter. He also authored a number of advanced publicationsthat have become classic references and textbooks for researchers and students.Richard Feynman was a constructive public man. His work on the Challengercommission is well known, especially his famous demonstration of the susceptibilityof the O-rings to cold, an elegant experiment which required nothing more thana glass of ice water and a C-clamp. Less well known were Dr. Feynman’s eﬀortson the California State Curriculum Committee in the 1960s, where he protestedthe mediocrity of textbooks.

A recital of Richard Feynman’s myriad scientiﬁc and educational accomplish-ments cannot adequately capture the essence of the man. As any reader ofeven his most technical publications knows, Feynman’s lively and multi-sidedpersonality shines through all his work. Besides being a physicist, he was atvarious times a repairer of radios, a picker of locks, an artist, a dancer, a bongoplayer, and even a decipherer of Mayan Hieroglyphics. Perpetually curious abouthis world, he was an exemplary empiricist.

Richard Feynman died on February 15, 1988, in Los Angeles.

Preface to the New Millennium Edition

Nearly ﬁfty years have passed since Richard Feynman taught the introductoryphysics course at Caltech that gave rise to these three volumes, The FeynmanLectures on Physics.In those ﬁfty years our understanding of the physicalworld has changed greatly, but The Feynman Lectures on Physics has endured.Feynman’s lectures are as powerful today as when ﬁrst published, thanks toFeynman’s unique physics insights and pedagogy. They have been studiedworldwide by novices and mature physicists alike; they have been translatedinto at least a dozen languages with more than 1.5 millions copies printed in theEnglish language alone. Perhaps no other set of physics books has had such wideimpact, for so long.

This New Millennium Edition ushers in a new era for The Feynman Lectureson Physics (FLP): the twenty-ﬁrst century era of electronic publishing. FLPhas been converted to eFLP, with the text and equations expressed in the LATEXelectronic typesetting language, and all ﬁgures redone using modern drawingsoftware.

The consequences for the print version of this edition are not startling; itlooks almost the same as the original red books that physics students have knownand loved for decades. The main diﬀerences are an expanded and improved index,the correction of 885 errata found by readers over the ﬁve years since the ﬁrstprinting of the previous edition, and the ease of correcting errata that futurereaders may ﬁnd. To this I shall return below.

The eBook Version of this edition, and the Enhanced Electronic Version areelectronic innovations. By contrast with most eBook versions of 20th century tech-nical books, whose equations, ﬁgures and sometimes even text become pixellatedwhen one tries to enlarge them, the LATEX manuscript of the New MillenniumEdition makes it possible to create eBooks of the highest quality, in which all

v

features on the page (except photographs) can be enlarged without bound andretain their precise shapes and sharpness. And the Enhanced Electronic Version,with its audio and blackboard photos from Feynman’s original lectures, and itslinks to other resources, is an innovation that would have given Feynman greatpleasure.

Memories of Feynman’s Lectures

These three volumes are a self-contained pedagogical treatise. They are also ahistorical record of Feynman’s 1961–64 undergraduate physics lectures, a courserequired of all Caltech freshmen and sophomores regardless of their majors.

Readers may wonder, as I have, how Feynman’s lectures impacted the studentswho attended them. Feynman, in his Preface to these volumes, oﬀered a somewhatnegative view.「I don’t think I did very well by the students,」he wrote. MatthewSands, in his memoir in Feynman’s Tips on Physics expressed a far more positiveview. Out of curiosity, in spring 2005 I emailed or talked to a quasi-random setof 17 students (out of about 150) from Feynman’s 1961–63 class — some who hadgreat diﬃculty with the class, and some who mastered it with ease; majors inbiology, chemistry, engineering, geology, mathematics and astronomy, as well asin physics.

The intervening years might have glazed their memories with a euphoric tint,but about 80 percent recall Feynman’s lectures as highlights of their college years.「It was like going to church.」The lectures were「a transformational experience,」「the experience of a lifetime, probably the most important thing I got fromCaltech.」「I was a biology major but Feynman’s lectures stand out as a highpoint in my undergraduate experience . . . though I must admit I couldn’t dothe homework at the time and I hardly turned any of it in.」「I was among theleast promising of students in this course, and I never missed a lecture. . . . Iremember and can still feel Feynman’s joy of discovery. . . . His lectures had an. . . emotional impact that was probably lost in the printed Lectures.」By contrast, several of the students have negative memories due largely to twoissues: (i)「You couldn’t learn to work the homework problems by attending thelectures. Feynman was too slick — he knew tricks and what approximations couldbe made, and had intuition based on experience and genius that a beginningstudent does not possess.」Feynman and colleagues, aware of this ﬂaw in thecourse, addressed it in part with materials that have been incorporated intoFeynman’s Tips on Physics: three problem-solving lectures by Feynman, and

vi

a set of exercises and answers assembled by Robert B. Leighton and RochusVogt. (ii)「The insecurity of not knowing what was likely to be discussed inthe next lecture, the lack of a text book or reference with any connection tothe lecture material, and consequent inability for us to read ahead, were veryfrustrating. . . . I found the lectures exciting and understandable in the hall, butthey were Sanskrit outside [when I tried to reconstruct the details].」This problem,of course, was solved by these three volumes, the printed version of The FeynmanLectures on Physics. They became the textbook from which Caltech studentsstudied for many years thereafter, and they live on today as one of Feynman’sgreatest legacies.

A History of Errata

The Feynman Lectures on Physics was produced very quickly by Feynmanand his co-authors, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, working fromand expanding on tape recordings and blackboard photos of Feynman’s courselectures* (both of which are incorporated into the Enhanced Electronic Versionof this New Millennium Edition). Given the high speed at which Feynman,Leighton and Sands worked, it was inevitable that many errors crept into the ﬁrstedition. Feynman accumulated long lists of claimed errata over the subsequentyears — errata found by students and faculty at Caltech and by readers aroundthe world. In the 1960’s and early 70’s, Feynman made time in his intense lifeto check most but not all of the claimed errata for Volumes I and II, and insertcorrections into subsequent printings. But Feynman’s sense of duty never rosehigh enough above the excitement of discovering new things to make him dealwith the errata in Volume III.† After his untimely death in 1988, lists of erratafor all three volumes were deposited in the Caltech Archives, and there they layforgotten.

In 2002 Ralph Leighton (son of the late Robert Leighton and compatriot ofFeynman) informed me of the old errata and a new long list compiled by Ralph’s

* For descriptions of the genesis of Feynman’s lectures and of these volumes, see Feynman’sPreface and the Forewords to each of the three volumes, and also Matt Sands’ Memoir inFeynman’s Tips on Physics, and the Special Preface to the Commemorative Edition of FLP,written in 1989 by David Goodstein and Gerry Neugebauer, which also appears in the 2005Deﬁnitive Edition.

† In 1975, he started checking errata for Volume III but got distracted by other things and

never ﬁnished the task, so no corrections were made.

friend Michael Gottlieb. Leighton proposed that Caltech produce a new editionof The Feynman Lectures with all errata corrected, and publish it alongside a newvolume of auxiliary material, Feynman’s Tips on Physics, which he and Gottliebwere preparing.Feynman was my hero and a close personal friend. When I saw the lists oferrata and the content of the proposed new volume, I quickly agreed to overseethis project on behalf of Caltech (Feynman’s long-time academic home, to whichhe, Leighton and Sands had entrusted all rights and responsibilities for TheFeynman Lectures). After a year and a half of meticulous work by Gottlieb, andcareful scrutiny by Dr. Michael Hartl (an outstanding Caltech postdoc who vettedall errata plus the new volume), the 2005 Deﬁnitive Edition of The FeynmanLectures on Physics was born, with about 200 errata corrected and accompaniedby Feynman’s Tips on Physics by Feynman, Gottlieb and Leighton.I thought that edition was going to be「Deﬁnitive」. What I did not antic-ipate was the enthusiastic response of readers around the world to an appealfrom Gottlieb to identify further errata, and submit them via a website thatGottlieb created and continues to maintain, The Feynman Lectures Website,www.feynmanlectures.info. In the ﬁve years since then, 965 new errata havebeen submitted and survived the meticulous scrutiny of Gottlieb, Hartl, and NateBode (an outstanding Caltech physics graduate student, who succeeded Hartlas Caltech’s vetter of errata). Of these, 965 vetted errata, 80 were corrected inthe fourth printing of the Deﬁnitive Edition (August 2006) and the remaining885 are corrected in the ﬁrst printing of this New Millennium Edition (332 involume I, 263 in volume II, and 200 in volume III). For details of the errata, seewww.feynmanlectures.info.Clearly, making The Feynman Lectures on Physics error-free has become aworld-wide community enterprise. On behalf of Caltech I thank the 50 readerswho have contributed since 2005 and the many more who may contribute over thecoming years. The names of all contributors are posted at www.feynmanlectures.info/flp_errata.html.Almost all the errata have been of three types: (i) typographical errorsin prose; (ii) typographical and mathematical errors in equations, tables andﬁgures — sign errors, incorrect numbers (e.g., a 5 that should be a 4), and missingsubscripts, summation signs, parentheses and terms in equations; (iii) incorrectcross references to chapters, tables and ﬁgures. These kinds of errors, thoughnot terribly serious to a mature physicist, can be frustrating and confusing toFeynman’s primary audience: students.

viii

It is remarkable that among the 1165 errata corrected under my auspices,only several do I regard as true errors in physics. An example is Volume II,page 5-9, which now says「. . . no static distribution of charges inside a closedgrounded conductor can produce any [electric] ﬁelds outside」(the word groundedwas omitted in previous editions). This error was pointed out to Feynman by anumber of readers, including Beulah Elizabeth Cox, a student at The College ofWilliam and Mary, who had relied on Feynman’s erroneous passage in an exam.To Ms. Cox, Feynman wrote in 1975,*「Your instructor was right not to giveyou any points, for your answer was wrong, as he demonstrated using Gauss’slaw. You should, in science, believe logic and arguments, carefully drawn, andnot authorities. You also read the book correctly and understood it. I made amistake, so the book is wrong. I probably was thinking of a grounded conductingsphere, or else of the fact that moving the charges around in diﬀerent placesinside does not aﬀect things on the outside. I am not sure how I did it, but Igoofed. And you goofed, too, for believing me.」

How this New Millennium Edition Came to Be

Between November 2005 and July 2006, 340 errata were submitted to TheFeynman Lectures Website www.feynmanlectures.info. Remarkably, the bulkof these came from one person: Dr. Rudolf Pfeiﬀer, then a physics postdoctoralfellow at the University of Vienna, Austria. The publisher, Addison Wesley, ﬁxed80 errata, but balked at ﬁxing more because of cost: the books were being printedby a photo-oﬀset process, working from photographic images of the pages fromthe 1960s. Correcting an error involved re-typesetting the entire page, and toensure no new errors crept in, the page was re-typeset twice by two diﬀerentpeople, then compared and proofread by several other people — a very costlyprocess indeed, when hundreds of errata are involved.

Gottlieb, Pfeiﬀer and Ralph Leighton were very unhappy about this, so theyformulated a plan aimed at facilitating the repair of all errata, and also aimedat producing eBook and enhanced electronic versions of The Feynman Lectureson Physics. They proposed their plan to me, as Caltech’s representative, in2007. I was enthusiastic but cautious. After seeing further details, including aone-chapter demonstration of the Enhanced Electronic Version, I recommended

ix

that Caltech cooperate with Gottlieb, Pfeiﬀer and Leighton in the execution oftheir plan. The plan was approved by three successive chairs of Caltech’s Divisionof Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy — Tom Tombrello, Andrew Lange, andTom Soifer — and the complex legal and contractual details were worked out byCaltech’s Intellectual Property Counsel, Adam Cochran. With the publication ofthis New Millennium Edition, the plan has been executed successfully, despiteits complexity. Speciﬁcally:Pfeiﬀer and Gottlieb have converted into LATEX all three volumes of FLP(and also more than 1000 exercises from the Feynman course for incorporationinto Feynman’s Tips on Physics). The FLP ﬁgures were redrawn in modernelectronic form in India, under guidance of the FLP German translator, HenningHeinze, for use in the German edition. Gottlieb and Pfeiﬀer traded non-exclusiveuse of their LATEX equations in the German edition (published by Oldenbourg)for non-exclusive use of Heinze’s ﬁgures in this New Millennium English edition.Pfeiﬀer and Gottlieb have meticulously checked all the LATEX text and equationsand all the redrawn ﬁgures, and made corrections as needed. Nate Bode andI, on behalf of Caltech, have done spot checks of text, equations, and ﬁgures;and remarkably, we have found no errors. Pfeiﬀer and Gottlieb are unbelievablymeticulous and accurate. Gottlieb and Pfeiﬀer arranged for John Sullivan at theHuntington Library to digitize the photos of Feynman’s 1962–64 blackboards,and for George Blood Audio to digitize the lecture tapes — with ﬁnancial supportand encouragement from Caltech Professor Carver Mead, logistical support fromCaltech Archivist Shelley Erwin, and legal support from Cochran.

The legal issues were serious: In the 1960s, Caltech licensed to Addison Wesleyrights to publish the print edition, and in the 1990s, rights to distribute the audioof Feynman’s lectures and a variant of an electronic edition. In the 2000s, througha sequence of acquisitions of those licenses, the print rights were transferred tothe Pearson publishing group, while rights to the audio and the electronic versionwere transferred to the Perseus publishing group. Cochran, with the aid of IkeWilliams, an attorney who specializes in publishing, succeeded in uniting all ofthese rights with Perseus (Basic Books), making possible this New MillenniumEdition.

Feynman’s Preface

These are the lectures in physics that I gave last year and the year beforeto the freshman and sophomore classes at Caltech. The lectures are, of course,not verbatim — they have been edited, sometimes extensively and sometimes lessso. The lectures form only part of the complete course. The whole group of 180students gathered in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures andthen they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation sectionsunder the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition, there was a laboratorysession once a week.

The special problem we tried to get at with these lectures was to maintainthe interest of the very enthusiastic and rather smart students coming out ofthe high schools and into Caltech. They have heard a lot about how interestingand exciting physics is — the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and othermodern ideas. By the end of two years of our previous course, many would bevery discouraged because there were really very few grand, new, modern ideaspresented to them. They were made to study inclined planes, electrostatics, andso forth, and after two years it was quite stultifying. The problem was whetheror not we could make a course which would save the more advanced and excitedstudent by maintaining his enthusiasm.

The lectures here are not in any way meant to be a survey course, but are veryserious. I thought to address them to the most intelligent in the class and to makesure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to completelyencompass everything that was in the lectures — by putting in suggestions of

3

applications of the ideas and concepts in various directions outside the main lineof attack. For this reason, though, I tried very hard to make all the statementsas accurate as possible, to point out in every case where the equations and ideasﬁtted into the body of physics, and how — when they learned more — things wouldbe modiﬁed. I also felt that for such students it is important to indicate whatit is that they should — if they are suﬃciently clever — be able to understand bydeduction from what has been said before, and what is being put in as somethingnew. When new ideas came in, I would try either to deduce them if they werededucible, or to explain that it was a new idea which hadn’t any basis in terms ofthings they had already learned and which was not supposed to be provable — butwas just added in.

At the start of these lectures, I assumed that the students knew somethingwhen they came out of high school — such things as geometrical optics, simplechemistry ideas, and so on. I also didn’t see that there was any reason to make thelectures in a deﬁnite order, in the sense that I would not be allowed to mentionsomething until I was ready to discuss it in detail. There was a great deal ofmention of things to come, without complete discussions. These more completediscussions would come later when the preparation became more advanced.Examples are the discussions of inductance, and of energy levels, which are atﬁrst brought in in a very qualitative way and are later developed more completely.At the same time that I was aiming at the more active student, I also wantedto take care of the fellow for whom the extra ﬁreworks and side applications aremerely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn most of the materialin the lecture at all. For such students I wanted there to be at least a centralcore or backbone of material which he could get. Even if he didn’t understandeverything in a lecture, I hoped he wouldn’t get nervous. I didn’t expect him tounderstand everything, but only the central and most direct features. It takes,of course, a certain intelligence on his part to see which are the central theoremsand central ideas, and which are the more advanced side issues and applicationswhich he may understand only in later years.

In giving these lectures there was one serious diﬃculty: in the way the coursewas given, there wasn’t any feedback from the students to the lecturer to indicatehow well the lectures were going over. This is indeed a very serious diﬃculty, andI don’t know how good the lectures really are. The whole thing was essentiallyan experiment. And if I did it again I wouldn’t do it the same way — I hope Idon’t have to do it again! I think, though, that things worked out — so far as thephysics is concerned — quite satisfactorily in the ﬁrst year.

4

In the second year I was not so satisﬁed. In the ﬁrst part of the course, dealingwith electricity and magnetism, I couldn’t think of any really unique or diﬀerentway of doing it — of any way that would be particularly more exciting than theusual way of presenting it. So I don’t think I did very much in the lectures onelectricity and magnetism. At the end of the second year I had originally intendedto go on, after the electricity and magnetism, by giving some more lectures onthe properties of materials, but mainly to take up things like fundamental modes,solutions of the diﬀusion equation, vibrating systems, orthogonal functions, . . .developing the ﬁrst stages of what are usually called「the mathematical methodsof physics.」In retrospect, I think that if I were doing it again I would go backto that original idea. But since it was not planned that I would be giving theselectures again, it was suggested that it might be a good idea to try to give anintroduction to the quantum mechanics — what you will ﬁnd in Volume III.

It is perfectly clear that students who will major in physics can wait untiltheir third year for quantum mechanics. On the other hand, the argument wasmade that many of the students in our course study physics as a background fortheir primary interest in other ﬁelds. And the usual way of dealing with quantummechanics makes that subject almost unavailable for the great majority of studentsbecause they have to take so long to learn it. Yet, in its real applications — especially in its more complex applications, such as in electrical engineeringand chemistry — the full machinery of the diﬀerential equation approach is notactually used. So I tried to describe the principles of quantum mechanics ina way which wouldn’t require that one ﬁrst know the mathematics of partialdiﬀerential equations. Even for a physicist I think that is an interesting thingto try to do — to present quantum mechanics in this reverse fashion — for severalreasons which may be apparent in the lectures themselves. However, I think thatthe experiment in the quantum mechanics part was not completely successful — inlarge part because I really did not have enough time at the end (I should, forinstance, have had three or four more lectures in order to deal more completelywith such matters as energy bands and the spatial dependence of amplitudes).Also, I had never presented the subject this way before, so the lack of feedback wasparticularly serious. I now believe the quantum mechanics should be given at alater time. Maybe I’ll have a chance to do it again someday. Then I’ll do it right.The reason there are no lectures on how to solve problems is because therewere recitation sections. Although I did put in three lectures in the ﬁrst year onhow to solve problems, they are not included here. Also there was a lecture oninertial guidance which certainly belongs after the lecture on rotating systems,

5

but which was, unfortunately, omitted. The ﬁfth and sixth lectures are actuallydue to Matthew Sands, as I was out of town.

The question, of course, is how well this experiment has succeeded. My ownpoint of view — which, however, does not seem to be shared by most of the peoplewho worked with the students — is pessimistic. I don’t think I did very well bythe students. When I look at the way the majority of the students handled theproblems on the examinations, I think that the system is a failure. Of course,my friends point out to me that there were one or two dozen students who — verysurprisingly — understood almost everything in all of the lectures, and who werequite active in working with the material and worrying about the many pointsin an excited and interested way. These people have now, I believe, a ﬁrst-ratebackground in physics — and they are, after all, the ones I was trying to get at.But then,「The power of instruction is seldom of much eﬃcacy except in thosehappy dispositions where it is almost superﬂuous.」(Gibbon)

Still, I didn’t want to leave any student completely behind, as perhaps I did.I think one way we could help the students more would be by putting more hardwork into developing a set of problems which would elucidate some of the ideasin the lectures. Problems give a good opportunity to ﬁll out the material of thelectures and make more realistic, more complete, and more settled in the mindthe ideas that have been exposed.

I think, however, that there isn’t any solution to this problem of educationother than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is adirect individual relationship between a student and a good teacher — a situationin which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks aboutthe things. It’s impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, oreven by simply doing problems that are assigned. But in our modern times wehave so many students to teach that we have to try to ﬁnd some substitute forthe ideal. Perhaps my lectures can make some contribution. Perhaps in somesmall place where there are individual teachers and students, they may get someinspiration or some ideas from the lectures. Perhaps they will have fun thinkingthem through — or going on to develop some of the ideas further.

Foreword

This book is based upon a course of lectures in introductory physics givenby Prof. R. P. Feynman at the California Institute of Technology during theacademic year 1961–62; it covers the ﬁrst year of the two-year introductory coursetaken by all Caltech freshmen and sophomores, and was followed in 1962–63 bya similar series covering the second year. The lectures constitute a major part ofa fundamental revision of the introductory course, carried out over a four-yearperiod.

The need for a basic revision arose both from the rapid development of physicsin recent decades and from the fact that entering freshmen have shown a steadyincrease in mathematical ability as a result of improvements in high school mathe-matics course content. We hoped to take advantage of this improved mathematicalbackground, and also to introduce enough modern subject matter to make thecourse challenging, interesting, and more representative of present-day physics.In order to generate a variety of ideas on what material to include and how topresent it, a substantial number of the physics faculty were encouraged to oﬀertheir ideas in the form of topical outlines for a revised course. Several of these werepresented and were thoroughly and critically discussed. It was agreed almost atonce that a basic revision of the course could not be accomplished either by merelyadopting a diﬀerent textbook, or even by writing one ab initio, but that the newcourse should be centered about a set of lectures, to be presented at the rate oftwo or three per week; the appropriate text material would then be produced as asecondary operation as the course developed, and suitable laboratory experimentswould also be arranged to ﬁt the lecture material. Accordingly, a rough outline of

7

the course was established, but this was recognized as being incomplete, tentative,and subject to considerable modiﬁcation by whoever was to bear the responsibilityfor actually preparing the lectures.

Concerning the mechanism by which the course would ﬁnally be broughtto life, several plans were considered. These plans were mostly rather similar,involving a cooperative eﬀort by N staﬀ members who would share the totalburden symmetrically and equally: each man would take responsibility for 1/N ofthe material, deliver the lectures, and write text material for his part. However,the unavailability of suﬃcient staﬀ, and the diﬃculty of maintaining a uniformpoint of view because of diﬀerences in personality and philosophy of individualparticipants, made such plans seem unworkable.

The realization that we actually possessed the means to create not just anew and diﬀerent physics course, but possibly a unique one, came as a happyinspiration to Professor Sands. He suggested that Professor R. P. Feynman pre-pare and deliver the lectures, and that these be tape-recorded. When transcribedand edited, they would then become the textbook for the new course. This isessentially the plan that was adopted.

It was expected that the necessary editing would be minor, mainly consistingof supplying ﬁgures, and checking punctuation and grammar; it was to be done byone or two graduate students on a part-time basis. Unfortunately, this expectationwas short-lived. It was, in fact, a major editorial operation to transform theverbatim transcript into readable form, even without the reorganization or revisionof the subject matter that was sometimes required. Furthermore, it was not a jobfor a technical editor or for a graduate student, but one that required the closeattention of a professional physicist for from ten to twenty hours per lecture!

The diﬃculty of the editorial task, together with the need to place the materialin the hands of the students as soon as possible, set a strict limit upon the amountof「polishing」of the material that could be accomplished, and thus we wereforced to aim toward a preliminary but technically correct product that couldbe used immediately, rather than one that might be considered ﬁnal or ﬁnished.Because of an urgent need for more copies for our students, and a hearteninginterest on the part of instructors and students at several other institutions, wedecided to publish the material in its preliminary form rather than wait for afurther major revision which might never occur. We have no illusions as to thecompleteness, smoothness, or logical organization of the material; in fact, weplan several minor modiﬁcations in the course in the immediate future, and wehope that it will not become static in form or content.

8

In addition to the lectures, which constitute a centrally important part of thecourse, it was necessary also to provide suitable exercises to develop the students’experience and ability, and suitable experiments to provide ﬁrst-hand contactwith the lecture material in the laboratory. Neither of these aspects is in asadvanced a state as the lecture material, but considerable progress has been made.Some exercises were made up as the lectures progressed, and these were expandedand ampliﬁed for use in the following year. However, because we are not yetsatisﬁed that the exercises provide suﬃcient variety and depth of application ofthe lecture material to make the student fully aware of the tremendous powerbeing placed at his disposal, the exercises are published separately in a lesspermanent form in order to encourage frequent revision.

A number of new experiments for the new course have been devised byProfessor H. V. Neher. Among these are several which utilize the extremelylow friction exhibited by a gas bearing: a novel linear air trough, with whichquantitative measurements of one-dimensional motion, impacts, and harmonicmotion can be made, and an air-supported, air-driven Maxwell top, with whichaccelerated rotational motion and gyroscopic precession and nutation can bestudied. The development of new laboratory experiments is expected to continuefor a considerable period of time.

The revision program was under the direction of Professors R. B. Leighton,H. V. Neher, and M. Sands. Oﬃcially participating in the program were ProfessorsR. P. Feynman, G. Neugebauer, R. M. Sutton, H. P. Stabler,* F. Strong, and R.Vogt, from the division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy, and ProfessorsT. Caughey, M. Plesset, and C. H. Wilts from the division of Engineering Science.The valuable assistance of all those contributing to the revision program isgratefully acknowledged. We are particularly indebted to the Ford Foundation,without whose ﬁnancial assistance this program could not have been carried out.
