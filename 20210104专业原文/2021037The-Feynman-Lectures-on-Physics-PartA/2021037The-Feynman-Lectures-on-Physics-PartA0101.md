# 0101. Atoms in Motion

1-1 IntroductionThis two-year course in physics is presented from the point of view that you,the reader, are going to be a physicist. This is not necessarily the case of course,but that is what every professor in every subject assumes! If you are going to bea physicist, you will have a lot to study: two hundred years of the most rapidlydeveloping ﬁeld of knowledge that there is. So much knowledge, in fact, that youmight think that you cannot learn all of it in four years, and truly you cannot;you will have to go to graduate school too!

Surprisingly enough, in spite of the tremendous amount of work that has beendone for all this time it is possible to condense the enormous mass of results toa large extent—that is, to ﬁnd laws which summarize all our knowledge. Evenso, the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair to you to start exploring thistremendous subject without some kind of map or outline of the relationship of onepart of the subject of science to another. Following these preliminary remarks,the ﬁrst three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the restof the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning ofscience, to help us develop a「feel」for the subject.

You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the basic laws onpage one and then showing how they work in all possible circumstances, as wedo in Euclidean geometry, where we state the axioms and then make all sorts ofdeductions. (So, not satisﬁed to learn physics in four years, you want to learn itin four minutes?) We cannot do it in this way for two reasons. First, we do notyet know all the basic laws: there is an expanding frontier of ignorance. Second,the correct statement of the laws of physics involves some very unfamiliar ideaswhich require advanced mathematics for their description. Therefore, one needs aconsiderable amount of preparatory training even to learn what the words mean.No, it is not possible to do it that way. We can only do it piece by piece.

1-1

Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximationto the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it.In fact,everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know thatwe do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to beunlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected.The principle of science, the deﬁnition, almost, is the following: The test ofall knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientiﬁc「truth.」But what is the source of knowledge? Where do the laws that are to be testedcome from? Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that itgives us hints. But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the greatgeneralizations—to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patternsbeneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have madethe right guess. This imagining process is so diﬃcult that there is a division oflabor in physics: there are theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and guessat new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are experimental physicistswho experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess.We said that the laws of nature are approximate: that we ﬁrst ﬁnd the「wrong」ones, and then we ﬁnd the「right」ones. Now, how can an experiment be「wrong」?First, in a trivial way: if something is wrong with the apparatus that you didnot notice. But these things are easily ﬁxed, and checked back and forth. Sowithout snatching at such minor things, how can the results of an experimentbe wrong? Only by being inaccurate. For example, the mass of an object neverseems to change: a spinning top has the same weight as a still one. So a「law」was invented: mass is constant, independent of speed. That「law」is now foundto be incorrect. Mass is found to increase with velocity, but appreciable increasesrequire velocities near that of light. A true law is: if an object moves with aspeed of less than one hundred miles a second the mass is constant to within onepart in a million. In some such approximate form this is a correct law. So inpractice one might think that the new law makes no signiﬁcant diﬀerence. Well,yes and no. For ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it and use the simpleconstant-mass law as a good approximation. But for high speeds we are wrong,and the higher the speed, the more wrong we are.

Finally, and most interesting, philosophically we are completely wrong withthe approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered eventhough the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing aboutthe philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small eﬀect sometimesrequires profound changes in our ideas.

1-2

Now, what should we teach ﬁrst? Should we teach the correct but unfamiliarlaw with its strange and diﬃcult conceptual ideas, for example the theory ofrelativity, four-dimensional space-time, and so on? Or should we ﬁrst teach thesimple「constant-mass」law, which is only approximate, but does not involve suchdiﬃcult ideas? The ﬁrst is more exciting, more wonderful, and more fun, butthe second is easier to get at ﬁrst, and is a ﬁrst step to a real understanding ofthe ﬁrst idea. This point arises again and again in teaching physics. At diﬀerenttimes we shall have to resolve it in diﬀerent ways, but at each stage it is worthlearning what is now known, how accurate it is, how it ﬁts into everything else,and how it may be changed when we learn more.

Let us now proceed with our outline, or general map, of our understanding ofscience today (in particular, physics, but also of other sciences on the periphery),so that when we later concentrate on some particular point we will have someidea of the background, why that particular point is interesting, and how it ﬁtsinto the big structure. So, what is our over-all picture of the world?

1-2 Matter is made of atomsIf, in some cataclysm, all of scientiﬁc knowledge were to be destroyed, andonly one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statementwould contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is theatomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that allthings are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion,attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling uponbeing squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is anenormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination andthinking are applied.To illustrate the power of the atomic idea, suppose that we have a dropof water a quarter of an inch on the side. If we look at it very closely we seenothing but water—smooth, continuous water. Even if we magnify it with thebest optical microscope available—roughly two thousand times—then the waterdrop will be roughly forty feet across, about as big as a large room, and if welooked rather closely, we would still see relatively smooth water—but here andthere small football-shaped things swimming back and forth. Very interesting.These are paramecia. You may stop at this point and get so curious about theparamecia with their wiggling cilia and twisting bodies that you go no further,except perhaps to magnify the paramecia still more and see inside. This, of

1-3

Figure 1-1

course, is a subject for biology, but for the present we pass on and look stillmore closely at the water material itself, magnifying it two thousand times again.Now the drop of water extends about ﬁfteen miles across, and if we look veryclosely at it we see a kind of teeming, something which no longer has a smoothappearance—it looks something like a crowd at a football game as seen from avery great distance. In order to see what this teeming is about, we will magnifyit another two hundred and ﬁfty times and we will see something similar to whatis shown in Fig. 1-1. This is a picture of water magniﬁed a billion times, butidealized in several ways. In the ﬁrst place, the particles are drawn in a simplemanner with sharp edges, which is inaccurate. Secondly, for simplicity, they aresketched almost schematically in a two-dimensional arrangement, but of coursethey are moving around in three dimensions. Notice that there are two kinds of「blobs」or circles to represent the atoms of oxygen (black) and hydrogen (white),and that each oxygen has two hydrogens tied to it. (Each little group of anoxygen with its two hydrogens is called a molecule.) The picture is idealizedfurther in that the real particles in nature are continually jiggling and bouncing,turning and twisting around one another. You will have to imagine this as adynamic rather than a static picture. Another thing that cannot be illustrated ina drawing is the fact that the particles are「stuck together」—that they attracteach other, this one pulled by that one, etc. The whole group is「glued together,」so to speak. On the other hand, the particles do not squeeze through each other.If you try to squeeze two of them too close together, they repel.

The atoms are 1 or 2×10−8 cm in radius. Now 10−8 cm is called an angstrom(just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Anotherway to remember their size is this: if an apple is magniﬁed to the size of the earth,then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple.

1-4

Now imagine this great drop of water with all of these jiggling particles stucktogether and tagging along with each other. The water keeps its volume; it doesnot fall apart, because of the attraction of the molecules for each other. If thedrop is on a slope, where it can move from one place to another, the water willﬂow, but it does not just disappear—things do not just ﬂy apart—because of themolecular attraction. Now the jiggling motion is what we represent as heat: whenwe increase the temperature, we increase the motion. If we heat the water, thejiggling increases and the volume between the atoms increases, and if the heatingcontinues there comes a time when the pull between the molecules is not enoughto hold them together and they do ﬂy apart and become separated from oneanother. Of course, this is how we manufacture steam out of water—by increasingthe temperature; the particles ﬂy apart because of the increased motion.

Figure 1-2

In Fig. 1-2 we have a picture of steam. This picture of steam fails in onerespect: at ordinary atmospheric pressure there certainly would not be as manyas three water molecules in this ﬁgure. Most squares this size would containnone—but we accidentally have two and a half or three in the picture (justso it would not be completely blank). Now in the case of steam we see thecharacteristic molecules more clearly than in the case of water. For simplicity, themolecules are drawn so that there is a 120◦ angle between the hydrogen atoms. Inactual fact the angle is 105◦30, and the distance between the center of a hydrogenand the center of the oxygen is 0.957 Å, so we know this molecule very well.

Let us see what some of the properties of steam vapor or any other gas are.The molecules, being separated from one another, will bounce against the walls.Imagine a room with a number of tennis balls (a hundred or so) bouncing aroundin perpetual motion. When they bombard the wall, this pushes the wall away.

1-5

Figure 1-3

(Of course we would have to push the wall back.) This means that the gas exertsa jittery force which our coarse senses (not being ourselves magniﬁed a billiontimes) feel only as an average push. In order to conﬁne a gas we must applya pressure. Figure 1-3 shows a standard vessel for holding gases (used in alltextbooks), a cylinder with a piston in it. Now, it makes no diﬀerence what theshapes of water molecules are, so for simplicity we shall draw them as tennis ballsor little dots. These things are in perpetual motion in all directions. So many ofthem are hitting the top piston all the time that to keep it from being patientlyknocked out of the tank by this continuous banging, we shall have to hold thepiston down by a certain force, which we call the pressure (really, the pressuretimes the area is the force). Clearly, the force is proportional to the area, for ifwe increase the area but keep the number of molecules per cubic centimeter thesame, we increase the number of collisions with the piston in the same proportionas the area was increased.

Now let us put twice as many molecules in this tank, so as to double thedensity, and let them have the same speed, i.e., the same temperature. Then, toa close approximation, the number of collisions will be doubled, and since eachwill be just as「energetic」as before, the pressure is proportional to the density.If we consider the true nature of the forces between the atoms, we would expecta slight decrease in pressure because of the attraction between the atoms, anda slight increase because of the ﬁnite volume they occupy. Nevertheless, to anexcellent approximation, if the density is low enough that there are not manyatoms, the pressure is proportional to the density.

We can also see something else: If we increase the temperature withoutchanging the density of the gas, i.e., if we increase the speed of the atoms, whatis going to happen to the pressure? Well, the atoms hit harder because they are

1-6

moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases.You see how simple the ideas of atomic theory are.

Let us consider another situation. Suppose that the piston moves inward, sothat the atoms are slowly compressed into a smaller space. What happens whenan atom hits the moving piston? Evidently it picks up speed from the collision.You can try it by bouncing a ping-pong ball from a forward-moving paddle, forexample, and you will ﬁnd that it comes oﬀ with more speed than that withwhich it struck. (Special example: if an atom happens to be standing still andthe piston hits it, it will certainly move.) So the atoms are「hotter」when theycome away from the piston than they were before they struck it. Therefore allthe atoms which are in the vessel will have picked up speed. This means thatwhen we compress a gas slowly, the temperature of the gas increases. So, underslow compression, a gas will increase in temperature, and under slow expansionit will decrease in temperature.We now return to our drop of water and look in another direction. Supposethat we decrease the temperature of our drop of water. Suppose that the jigglingof the molecules of the atoms in the water is steadily decreasing. We know thatthere are forces of attraction between the atoms, so that after a while they willnot be able to jiggle so well. What will happen at very low temperatures isindicated in Fig. 1-4: the molecules lock into a new pattern which is ice. Thisparticular schematic diagram of ice is wrong because it is in two dimensions, butit is right qualitatively. The interesting point is that the material has a deﬁniteplace for every atom, and you can easily appreciate that if somehow or otherwe were to hold all the atoms at one end of the drop in a certain arrangement,each atom in a certain place, then because of the structure of interconnections,which is rigid, the other end miles away (at our magniﬁed scale) will have a

Figure 1-4

1-7

deﬁnite location. So if we hold a needle of ice at one end, the other end resistsour pushing it aside, unlike the case of water, in which the structure is brokendown because of the increased jiggling so that the atoms all move around indiﬀerent ways. The diﬀerence between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solidthe atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called a crystalline array, andthey do not have a random position at long distances; the position of the atomson one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atomsaway on the other side of the crystal. Figure 1-4 is an invented arrangement forice, and although it contains many of the correct features of ice, it is not the truearrangement. One of the correct features is that there is a part of the symmetrythat is hexagonal. You can see that if we turn the picture around an axis by 60◦,the picture returns to itself. So there is a symmetry in the ice which accounts forthe six-sided appearance of snowﬂakes. Another thing we can see from Fig. 1-4 iswhy ice shrinks when it melts. The particular crystal pattern of ice shown herehas many「holes」in it, as does the true ice structure. When the organizationbreaks down, these holes can be occupied by molecules. Most simple substances,with the exception of water and type metal, expand upon melting, because theatoms are closely packed in the solid crystal and upon melting need more roomto jiggle around, but an open structure collapses, as in the case of water.

Now although ice has a「rigid」crystalline form, its temperature can change—ice has heat. If we wish, we can change the amount of heat. What is the heat inthe case of ice? The atoms are not standing still. They are jiggling and vibrating.So even though there is a deﬁnite order to the crystal—a deﬁnite structure—all ofthe atoms are vibrating「in place.」As we increase the temperature, they vibratewith greater and greater amplitude, until they shake themselves out of place. Wecall this melting. As we decrease the temperature, the vibration decreases anddecreases until, at absolute zero, there is a minimum amount of vibration thatthe atoms can have, but not zero. This minimum amount of motion that atomscan have is not enough to melt a substance, with one exception: helium. Heliummerely decreases the atomic motions as much as it can, but even at absolute zerothere is still enough motion to keep it from freezing. Helium, even at absolutezero, does not freeze, unless the pressure is made so great as to make the atomssquash together. If we increase the pressure, we can make it solidify.

1-3 Atomic processesSo much for the description of solids, liquids, and gases from the atomic pointof view. However, the atomic hypothesis also describes processes, and so we shall

1-8

Figure 1-5

now look at a number of processes from an atomic standpoint. The ﬁrst processthat we shall look at is associated with the surface of the water. What happens atthe surface of the water? We shall now make the picture more complicated—andmore realistic—by imagining that the surface is in air. Figure 1-5 shows thesurface of water in air. We see the water molecules as before, forming a body ofliquid water, but now we also see the surface of the water. Above the surfacewe ﬁnd a number of things: First of all there are water molecules, as in steam.This is water vapor, which is always found above liquid water. (There is anequilibrium between the steam vapor and the water which will be described later.)In addition we ﬁnd some other molecules—here two oxygen atoms stuck togetherby themselves, forming an oxygen molecule, there two nitrogen atoms also stucktogether to make a nitrogen molecule. Air consists almost entirely of nitrogen,oxygen, some water vapor, and lesser amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, andother things. So above the water surface is the air, a gas, containing some watervapor. Now what is happening in this picture? The molecules in the water arealways jiggling around. From time to time, one on the surface happens to be hit alittle harder than usual, and gets knocked away. It is hard to see that happeningin the picture because it is a still picture. But we can imagine that one moleculenear the surface has just been hit and is ﬂying out, or perhaps another one hasbeen hit and is ﬂying out. Thus, molecule by molecule, the water disappears—itevaporates. But if we close the vessel above, after a while we shall ﬁnd a largenumber of molecules of water amongst the air molecules. From time to time, oneof these vapor molecules comes ﬂying down to the water and gets stuck again.So we see that what looks like a dead, uninteresting thing—a glass of water with

1-9

a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years—really containsa dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time. To oureyes, our crude eyes, nothing is changing, but if we could see it a billion timesmagniﬁed, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing:molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back.

Why do we see no change? Because just as many molecules are leaving as arecoming back! In the long run「nothing happens.」If we then take the top of thevessel oﬀ and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the numberof molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends onthe jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced becausethere are so many fewer water molecules above the water. Therefore there aremore going out than coming in, and the water evaporates. Hence, if you wish toevaporate water turn on the fan!

Here is something else: Which molecules leave? When a molecule leaves itis due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinaryenergy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors.Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones thatare left have less average motion than they had before. So the liquid graduallycools if it evaporates. Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air tothe water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches thesurface. This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat.So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generateheat. Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing—thewater is not changing temperature. If we blow on the water so as to maintain acontinuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled.Hence, blow on soup to cool it!

Of course you should realize that the processes just described are morecomplicated than we have indicated. Not only does the water go into the air, butalso, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and「get lost」in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water. Thusthe air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their wayinto the water and the water will contain air. If we suddenly take the air awayfrom the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in,and in doing so will make bubbles. This is very bad for divers, as you may know.Now we go on to another process. In Fig. 1-6 we see, from an atomic point ofview, a solid dissolving in water. If we put a crystal of salt in the water, whatwill happen? Salt is a solid, a crystal, an organized arrangement of「salt atoms.」

1-10

Figure 1-6

Figure 1-7 is an illustration of the three-dimensional structure of common salt,sodium chloride. Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of whatwe call ions. An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has losta few electrons. In a salt crystal we ﬁnd chlorine ions (chlorine atoms with anextra electron) and sodium ions (sodium atoms with one electron missing). Theions all stick together by electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we putthem in the water we ﬁnd, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen andpositive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose. In Fig. 1-6 wesee a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms ﬂoating in the water in the formof ions. This picture was made with some care. Notice, for example, that thehydrogen ends of the water molecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion,

Figure 1-7

1-11

while near the sodium ion we are more likely to ﬁnd the oxygen end, because thesodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and they attractelectrically. Can we tell from this picture whether the salt is dissolving in wateror crystallizing out of water? Of course we cannot tell, because while some ofthe atoms are leaving the crystal other atoms are rejoining it. The process is adynamic one, just as in the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether thereis more or less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium. Byequilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms are leavingjust matches the rate at which they are coming back. If there is almost no salt inthe water, more atoms leave than return, and the salt dissolves. If, on the otherhand, there are too many「salt atoms,」more return than leave, and the salt iscrystallizing.

In passing, we mention that the concept of a molecule of a substance is onlyapproximate and exists only for a certain class of substances. It is clear in thecase of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together. It is not so clear inthe case of sodium chloride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodiumand chlorine ions in a cubic pattern. There is no natural way to group them as「molecules of salt.」

Returning to our discussion of solution and precipitation, if we increase thetemperature of the salt solution, then the rate at which atoms are taken awayis increased, and so is the rate at which atoms are brought back. It turns outto be very diﬃcult, in general, to predict which way it is going to go, whethermore or less of the solid will dissolve. Most substances dissolve more, but somesubstances dissolve less, as the temperature increases.

1-4 Chemical reactionsIn all of the processes which have been described so far, the atoms and theions have not changed partners, but of course there are circumstances in whichthe atoms do change combinations, forming new molecules. This is illustrated inFig. 1-8. A process in which the rearrangement of the atomic partners occurs iswhat we call a chemical reaction. The other processes so far described are calledphysical processes, but there is no sharp distinction between the two. (Naturedoes not care what we call it, she just keeps on doing it.) This ﬁgure is supposedto represent carbon burning in oxygen. In the case of oxygen, two oxygen atomsstick together very strongly. (Why do not three or even four stick together? Thatis one of the very peculiar characteristics of such atomic processes. Atoms are

1-12

Figure 1-8

very special: they like certain particular partners, certain particular directions,and so on. It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants.At any rate, two oxygen atoms form, saturated and happy, a molecule.)

The carbon atoms are supposed to be in a solid crystal (which could begraphite or diamond*). Now, for example, one of the oxygen molecules can comeover to the carbon, and each atom can pick up a carbon atom and go ﬂying oﬀin a new combination—「carbon-oxygen」—which is a molecule of the gas calledcarbon monoxide. It is given the chemical name CO. It is very simple: the letters「CO」are practically a picture of that molecule. But carbon attracts oxygenmuch more than oxygen attracts oxygen or carbon attracts carbon. Thereforein this process the oxygen may arrive with only a little energy, but the oxygenand carbon will snap together with a tremendous vengeance and commotion, andeverything near them will pick up the energy. A large amount of motion energy,kinetic energy, is thus generated. This of course is burning; we are getting heatfrom the combination of oxygen and carbon. The heat is ordinarily in the formof the molecular motion of the hot gas, but in certain circumstances it can be soenormous that it generates light. That is how one gets ﬂames.In addition, the carbon monoxide is not quite satisﬁed. It is possible for it toattach another oxygen, so that we might have a much more complicated reactionin which the oxygen is combining with the carbon, while at the same time therehappens to be a collision with a carbon monoxide molecule. One oxygen atomcould attach itself to the CO and ultimately form a molecule, composed of onecarbon and two oxygens, which is designated CO2 and called carbon dioxide. Ifwe burn the carbon with very little oxygen in a very rapid reaction (for example,in an automobile engine, where the explosion is so fast that there is not time

* One can burn a diamond in air.

1-13

for it to make carbon dioxide) a considerable amount of carbon monoxide isformed. In many such rearrangements, a very large amount of energy is released,forming explosions, ﬂames, etc., depending on the reactions. Chemists havestudied these arrangements of the atoms, and found that every substance is sometype of arrangement of atoms.

To illustrate this idea, let us consider another example. If we go into a ﬁeldof small violets, we know what「that smell」is. It is some kind of molecule, orarrangement of atoms, that has worked its way into our noses. First of all, howdid it work its way in? That is rather easy. If the smell is some kind of moleculein the air, jiggling around and being knocked every which way, it might haveaccidentally worked its way into the nose. Certainly it has no particular desire toget into our nose. It is merely one helpless part of a jostling crowd of molecules,and in its aimless wanderings this particular chunk of matter happens to ﬁnditself in the nose.

Now chemists can take special molecules like the odor of violets, and analyzethem and tell us the exact arrangement of the atoms in space. We know thatthe carbon dioxide molecule is straight and symmetrical: O—C—O. (That canbe determined easily, too, by physical methods.) However, even for the vastlymore complicated arrangements of atoms that there are in chemistry, one can,by a long, remarkable process of detective work, ﬁnd the arrangements of theatoms. Figure 1-9 is a picture of the air in the neighborhood of a violet; againwe ﬁnd nitrogen and oxygen in the air, and water vapor. (Why is there watervapor? Because the violet is wet. All plants transpire.) However, we also seea「monster」composed of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms,which have picked a certain particular pattern in which to be arranged. It isa much more complicated arrangement than that of carbon dioxide; in fact, it

Figure 1-9

1-14

Fig. 1-10. The substance pictured is α-irone.

is an enormously complicated arrangement. Unfortunately, we cannot pictureall that is really known about it chemically, because the precise arrangementof all the atoms is actually known in three dimensions, while our picture is inonly two dimensions. The six carbons which form a ring do not form a ﬂat ring,but a kind of「puckered」ring. All of the angles and distances are known. So achemical formula is merely a picture of such a molecule. When the chemist writessuch a thing on the blackboard, he is trying to「draw,」roughly speaking, in twodimensions. For example, we see a「ring」of six carbons, and a「chain」of carbonshanging on the end, with an oxygen second from the end, three hydrogens tiedto that carbon, two carbons and three hydrogens sticking up here, etc.

How does the chemist ﬁnd what the arrangement is? He mixes bottles full ofstuﬀ together, and if it turns red, it tells him that it consists of one hydrogenand two carbons tied on here; if it turns blue, on the other hand, that is notthe way it is at all. This is one of the most fantastic pieces of detective workthat has ever been done—organic chemistry. To discover the arrangement of theatoms in these enormously complicated arrays the chemist looks at what happenswhen he mixes two diﬀerent substances together. The physicist could never quitebelieve that the chemist knew what he was talking about when he describedthe arrangement of the atoms. For about twenty years it has been possible, insome cases, to look at such molecules (not quite as complicated as this one, butsome which contain parts of it) by a physical method, and it has been possibleto locate every atom, not by looking at colors, but by measuring where they are.And lo and behold!, the chemists are almost always correct.

It turns out, in fact, that in the odor of violets there are three slightly diﬀerent

molecules, which diﬀer only in the arrangement of the hydrogen atoms.

One problem of chemistry is to name a substance, so that we will know whatit is. Find a name for this shape! Not only must the name tell the shape, but

1-15

it must also tell that here is an oxygen atom, there a hydrogen—exactly whatand where each atom is. So we can appreciate that the chemical names mustbe complex in order to be complete. You see that the name of this thing inthe more complete form that will tell you the structure of it is 4-(2, 2, 3, 6tetramethyl-5-cyclohexenyl)-3-buten-2-one, and that tells you that this is thearrangement. We can appreciate the diﬃculties that the chemists have, and alsoappreciate the reason for such long names. It is not that they wish to be obscure,but they have an extremely diﬃcult problem in trying to describe the moleculesin words!

How do we know that there are atoms? By one of the tricks mentioned earlier:we make the hypothesis that there are atoms, and one after the other results comeout the way we predict, as they ought to if things are made of atoms. There isalso somewhat more direct evidence, a good example of which is the following:The atoms are so small that you cannot see them with a light microscope—infact, not even with an electron microscope. (With a light microscope you canonly see things which are much bigger.) Now if the atoms are always in motion,say in water, and we put a big ball of something in the water, a ball much biggerthan the atoms, the ball will jiggle around—much as in a push ball game, wherea great big ball is pushed around by a lot of people. The people are pushing invarious directions, and the ball moves around the ﬁeld in an irregular fashion.So, in the same way, the「large ball」will move because of the inequalities of thecollisions on one side to the other, from one moment to the next. Therefore, if welook at very tiny particles (colloids) in water through an excellent microscope, wesee a perpetual jiggling of the particles, which is the result of the bombardmentof the atoms. This is called the Brownian motion.We can see further evidence for atoms in the structure of crystals. In manycases the structures deduced by x-ray analysis agree in their spatial「shapes」with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The anglesbetween the various「faces」of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with anglesdeduced on the assumption that a crystal is made of many「layers」of atoms.

Everything is made of atoms. That is the key hypothesis. The most importanthypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that everything that animals do, atomsdo. In other words, there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understoodfrom the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the lawsof physics. This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimentingand theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is themost useful theory for producing new ideas in the ﬁeld of biology.

If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other,can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these littleblobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves andfoam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if allof this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms, howmuch more is possible? If instead of arranging the atoms in some deﬁnite pattern,again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexitylike the odor of violets, we make an arrangement which is always diﬀerent fromplace to place, with diﬀerent kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continuallychanging, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thingmight behave? Is it possible that that「thing」walking back and forth in front ofyou, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms in a very complex arrangement,such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it cando? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are merely a pileof atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the othermight well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror.
