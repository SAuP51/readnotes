Time and Distance

5-1 MotionIn this chapter we shall consider some aspects of the concepts of time anddistance. It has been emphasized earlier that physics, as do all the sciences,depends on observation. One might also say that the development of the physicalsciences to their present form has depended to a large extent on the emphasiswhich has been placed on the making of quantitative observations. Only withquantitative observations can one arrive at quantitative relationships, which arethe heart of physics.

Many people would like to place the beginnings of physics with the work done350 years ago by Galileo, and to call him the ﬁrst physicist. Until that time, thestudy of motion had been a philosophical one based on arguments that could bethought up in one’s head. Most of the arguments had been presented by Aristotleand other Greek philosophers, and were taken as「proven.」Galileo was skeptical,and did an experiment on motion which was essentially this: He allowed a ballto roll down an inclined trough and observed the motion. He did not, however,just look; he measured how far the ball went in how long a time.The way to measure a distance was well known long before Galileo, but therewere no accurate ways of measuring time, particularly short times. Althoughhe later devised more satisfactory clocks (though not like the ones we know),Galileo’s ﬁrst experiments on motion were done by using his pulse to count oﬀequal intervals of time. Let us do the same.

We may count oﬀ beats of a pulse as the ball rolls down the track:「one . . .two . . . three . . . four . . . ﬁve . . . six . . . seven . . . eight . . . 」We ask a friend tomake a small mark at the location of the ball at each count; we can then measurethe distance the ball travelled from the point of release in one, or two, or three,etc., equal intervals of time. Galileo expressed the result of his observations inthis way: if the location of the ball is marked at 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . units of time

5-1

from the instant of its release, those marks are distant from the starting point inproportion to the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . Today we would say the distance isproportional to the square of the time:

D ∝ t2.

The study of motion, which is basic to all of physics, treats with the questions:

where? and when?

5-2 TimeLet us consider ﬁrst what we mean by time. What is time? It would be niceif we could ﬁnd a good deﬁnition of time. Webster deﬁnes「a time」as「a period,」and the latter as「a time,」which doesn’t seem to be very useful. Perhaps weshould say:「Time is what happens when nothing else happens.」Which alsodoesn’t get us very far. Maybe it is just as well if we face the fact that time isone of the things we probably cannot deﬁne (in the dictionary sense), and justsay that it is what we already know it to be: it is how long we wait!

What really matters anyway is not how we deﬁne time, but how we measureit. One way of measuring time is to utilize something which happens over andover again in a regular fashion—something which is periodic. For example, a day.A day seems to happen over and over again. But when you begin to think aboutit, you might well ask:「Are days periodic; are they regular? Are all days thesame length?」One certainly has the impression that days in summer are longerthan days in winter. Of course, some of the days in winter seem to get awfullylong if one is very bored. You have certainly heard someone say,「My, but thishas been a long day!」

It does seem, however, that days are about the same length on the average.Is there any way we can test whether the days are the same length—either from

5-2

one day to the next, or at least on the average? One way is to make a comparisonwith some other periodic phenomenon. Let us see how such a comparison mightbe made with an hour glass. With an hour glass, we can「create」a periodicoccurrence if we have someone standing by it day and night to turn it overwhenever the last grain of sand runs out.

We could then count the turnings of the glass from each morning to the next.We would ﬁnd, this time, that the number of「hours」(i.e., turnings of the glass)was not the same each「day.」We should distrust the sun, or the glass, or both.After some thought, it might occur to us to count the「hours」from noon to noon.(Noon is here deﬁned not as 12:00 o’clock, but that instant when the sun is at itshighest point.) We would ﬁnd, this time, that the number of「hours」each day isthe same.

We now have some conﬁdence that both the「hour」and the「day」have aregular periodicity, i.e., mark oﬀ successive equal intervals of time, although wehave not proved that either one is「really」periodic. Someone might questionwhether there might not be some omnipotent being who would slow down theﬂow of sand every night and speed it up during the day. Our experiment doesnot, of course, give us an answer to this sort of question. All we can say is thatwe ﬁnd that a regularity of one kind ﬁts together with a regularity of anotherkind. We can just say that we base our deﬁnition of time on the repetition ofsome apparently periodic event.

5-3 Short timesWe should now notice that in the process of checking on the reproducibilityof the day, we have received an important by-product. We have found a way ofmeasuring, more accurately, fractions of a day. We have found a way of countingtime in smaller pieces. Can we carry the process further, and learn to measureeven smaller intervals of time?

Galileo decided that a given pendulum always swings back and forth in equalintervals of time so long as the size of the swing is kept small. A test comparingthe number of swings of a pendulum in one「hour」shows that such is indeedthe case. We can in this way mark fractions of an hour. If we use a mechanicaldevice to count the swings—and to keep them going—we have the pendulumclock of our grandfathers.

Let us agree that if our pendulum oscillates 3600 times in one hour (and ifthere are 24 such hours in a day), we shall call each period of the pendulum

5-3

one「second.」We have then divided our original unit of time into approximately105 parts. We can apply the same principles to divide the second into smallerand smaller intervals. It is, you will realize, not practical to make mechanicalpendulums which go arbitrarily fast, but we can now make electrical pendulums,called oscillators, which can provide a periodic occurrence with a very shortperiod of swing. In these electronic oscillators it is an electrical current whichswings to and fro, in a manner analogous to the swinging of the bob of thependulum.

We can make a series of such electronic oscillators, each with a period 10 timesshorter than the previous one. We may「calibrate」each oscillator against the nextslower one by counting the number of swings it makes for one swing of the sloweroscillator. When the period of oscillation of our clock is shorter than a fractionof a second, we cannot count the oscillations without the help of some devicewhich extends our powers of observation. One such device is the electron-beamoscilloscope, which acts as a sort of microscope for short times. This device plotson a ﬂuorescent screen a graph of electrical current (or voltage) versus time. Byconnecting the oscilloscope to two of our oscillators in sequence, so that it plots agraph ﬁrst of the current in one of our oscillators and then of the current in theother, we get two graphs like those shown in Fig. 5-2. We can readily determinethe number of periods of the faster oscillator in one period of the slower oscillator.With modern electronic techniques, oscillators have been built with periodsas short as about 10−12 second, and they have been calibrated (by comparisonmethods such as we have described) in terms of our standard unit of time, thesecond. With the invention and perfection of the「laser,」or light ampliﬁer, in thepast few years, it has become possible to make oscillators with even shorter periodsthan 10−12 second, but it has not yet been possible to calibrate them by themethods which have been described, although it will no doubt soon be possible.Times shorter than 10−12 second have been measured, but by a diﬀerenttechnique. In eﬀect, a diﬀerent deﬁnition of「time」has been used. One way hasbeen to observe the distance between two happenings on a moving object. If, forexample, the headlights of a moving automobile are turned on and then oﬀ, wecan ﬁgure out how long the lights were on if we know where they were turned onand oﬀ and how fast the car was moving. The time is the distance over whichthe lights were on divided by the speed.

Within the past few years, just such a technique was used to measure thelifetime of the π0-meson. By observing in a microscope the minute tracks left ina photographic emulsion in which π0-mesons had been created one saw that a

π0-meson (known to be travelling at a certain speed nearly that of light) wenta distance of about 10−7 meter, on the average, before disintegrating. It livedfor only about 10−16 sec. It should be emphasized that we have here used asomewhat diﬀerent deﬁnition of「time」than before. So long as there are noinconsistencies in our understanding, however, we feel fairly conﬁdent that ourdeﬁnitions are suﬃciently equivalent.

5-5

By extending our techniques—and if necessary our deﬁnitions—still furtherwe can infer the time duration of still faster physical events. We can speak ofthe period of a nuclear vibration. We can speak of the lifetime of the newlydiscovered strange resonances (particles) mentioned in Chapter 2. Their completelife occupies a time span of only 10−24 second, approximately the time it wouldtake light (which moves at the fastest known speed) to cross the nucleus ofhydrogen (the smallest known object).

What about still smaller times? Does「time」exist on a still smaller scale?Does it make any sense to speak of smaller times if we cannot measure—orperhaps even think sensibly about—something which happens in a shorter time?Perhaps not. These are some of the open questions which you will be asking andperhaps answering in the next twenty or thirty years.

5-4 Long timesLet us now consider times longer than one day. Measurement of longer timesis easy; we just count the days—so long as there is someone around to do thecounting. First we ﬁnd that there is another natural periodicity: the year, about365 days. We have also discovered that nature has sometimes provided a counterfor the years, in the form of tree rings or river-bottom sediments. In some caseswe can use these natural time markers to determine the time which has passedsince some early event.

When we cannot count the years for the measurement of long times, wemust look for other ways to measure. One of the most successful is the use ofradioactive material as a「clock.」In this case we do not have a periodic occurrence,as for the day or the pendulum, but a new kind of「regularity.」We ﬁnd that theradioactivity of a particular sample of material decreases by the same fractionfor successive equal increases in its age. If we plot a graph of the radioactivityobserved as a function of time (say in days), we obtain a curve like that shownin Fig. 5-3. We observe that if the radioactivity decreases to one-half in T days(called the「half-life」), then it decreases to one-quarter in another T days, and soon. In an arbitrary time interval t there are t/T「half-lives,」and the fractionleft after this time t is ( 1

If we knew that a piece of material, say a piece of wood, had contained anamount A of radioactive material when it was formed, and we found out by adirect measurement that it now contains the amount B, we could compute the

age of the object, t, by solving the equation

( 12)t/T = B/A.

There are, fortunately, cases in which we can know the amount of radioactivitythat was in an object when it was formed. We know, for example, that the carbondioxide in the air contains a certain small fraction of the radioactive carbonisotope C14 (replenished continuously by the action of cosmic rays). If we measurethe total carbon content of an object, we know that a certain fraction of thatamount was originally the radioactive C14; we know, therefore, the startingamount A to use in the formula above. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5000 years.By careful measurements we can measure the amount left after 20 half-lives orso and can therefore「date」organic objects which grew as long as 100,000 yearsago.We would like to know, and we think we do know, the life of still older things.Much of our knowledge is based on the measurements of other radioactive isotopeswhich have diﬀerent half-lives. If we make measurements with an isotope with alonger half-life, then we are able to measure longer times. Uranium, for example,has an isotope whose half-life is about 109 years, so that if some material wasformed with uranium in it 109 years ago, only half the uranium would remaintoday. When the uranium disintegrates, it changes into lead. Consider a piece ofrock which was formed a long time ago in some chemical process. Lead, being ofa chemical nature diﬀerent from uranium, would appear in one part of the rockand uranium would appear in another part of the rock. The uranium and leadwould be separate. If we look at that piece of rock today, where there should only

5-8

be uranium we will now ﬁnd a certain fraction of uranium and a certain fractionof lead. By comparing these fractions, we can tell what percent of the uraniumdisappeared and changed into lead. By this method, the age of certain rocks hasbeen determined to be several billion years. An extension of this method, notusing particular rocks but looking at the uranium and lead in the oceans andusing averages over the earth, has been used to determine (within the past fewyears) that the age of the earth itself is approximately 4.5 billion years.

It is encouraging that the age of the earth is found to be the same as the ageof the meteorites which land on the earth, as determined by the uranium method.It appears that the earth was formed out of rocks ﬂoating in space, and that themeteorites are, quite likely, some of that material left over. At some time morethan ﬁve billion years ago, the universe started. It is now believed that at leastour part of the universe had its beginning about ten or twelve billion years ago.We do not know what happened before then. In fact, we may well ask again:Does the question make any sense? Does an earlier time have any meaning?

5-5 Units and standards of timeWe have implied that it is convenient if we start with some standard unit oftime, say a day or a second, and refer all other times to some multiple or fractionof this unit. What shall we take as our basic standard of time? Shall we take thehuman pulse? If we compare pulses, we ﬁnd that they seem to vary a lot. Oncomparing two clocks, one ﬁnds they do not vary so much. You might then say,well, let us take a clock. But whose clock? There is a story of a Swiss boy whowanted all of the clocks in his town to ring noon at the same time. So he wentaround trying to convince everyone of the value of this. Everyone thought it wasa marvelous idea so long as all of the other clocks rang noon when his did! It israther diﬃcult to decide whose clock we should take as a standard. Fortunately,we all share one clock—the earth. For a long time the rotational period of theearth has been taken as the basic standard of time. As measurements have beenmade more and more precise, however, it has been found that the rotation of theearth is not exactly periodic, when measured in terms of the best clocks. These「best」clocks are those which we have reason to believe are accurate because theyagree with each other. We now believe that, for various reasons, some days arelonger than others, some days are shorter, and on the average the period of theearth becomes a little longer as the centuries pass.

5-9

Until very recently we had found nothing much better than the earth’s period,so all clocks have been related to the length of the day, and the second has beendeﬁned as 1/86,400 of an average day. Recently we have been gaining experiencewith some natural oscillators which we now believe would provide a more constanttime reference than the earth, and which are also based on a natural phenomenonavailable to everyone. These are the so-called「atomic clocks.」Their basic internalperiod is that of an atomic vibration which is very insensitive to the temperatureor any other external eﬀects. These clocks keep time to an accuracy of one partin 109 or better. Within the past two years an improved atomic clock whichoperates on the vibration of the hydrogen atom has been designed and built byProfessor Norman Ramsey at Harvard University. He believes that this clockmight be 100 times more accurate still. Measurements now in progress will showwhether this is true or not.

We may expect that since it has been possible to build clocks much moreaccurate than astronomical time, there will soon be an agreement among scientiststo deﬁne the unit of time in terms of one of the atomic clock standards.

5-6 Large distancesLet us now turn to the question of distance. How far, or how big, are things?Everybody knows that the way you measure distance is to start with a stick andcount. Or start with a thumb and count. You begin with a unit and count. Howdoes one measure smaller things? How does one subdivide distance? In the sameway that we subdivided time: we take a smaller unit and count the number ofsuch units it takes to make up the longer unit. So we can measure smaller andsmaller lengths.

But we do not always mean by distance what one gets by counting oﬀ witha meter stick. It would be diﬃcult to measure the horizontal distance betweentwo mountain tops using only a meter stick. We have found by experience thatdistance can be measured in another fashion: by triangulation. Although thismeans that we are really using a diﬀerent deﬁnition of distance, when they canboth be used they agree with each other. Space is more or less what Euclidthought it was, so the two types of deﬁnitions of distance agree. Since they doagree on the earth it gives us some conﬁdence in using triangulation for still largerdistances. For example, we were able to use triangulation to measure the heightof the ﬁrst Sputnik. We found that it was roughly 5 × 105 meters high. By morecareful measurements the distance to the moon can be measured in the same

5-10

way. Two telescopes at diﬀerent places on the earth can give us the two angleswe need. It has been found in this way that the moon is 4 × 108 meters away.We cannot do the same with the sun, or at least no one has been able to yet.The accuracy with which one can focus on a given point on the sun and with whichone can measure angles is not good enough to permit us to measure the distanceto the sun. Then how can we measure the distance to the sun? We must invent anextension of the idea of triangulation. We measure the relative distances of all theplanets by astronomical observations of where the planets appear to be, and weget a picture of the solar system with the proper relative distances of everything,but with no absolute distance. One absolute measurement is then required, whichhas been obtained in a number of ways. One of the ways, which was believeduntil recently to be the most accurate, was to measure the distance from theearth to Eros, one of the small planetoids which passes near the earth every nowand then. By triangulation on this little object, one could get the one requiredscale measurement. Knowing the relative distances of the rest, we can then tellthe distance, for example, from the earth to the sun, or from the earth to Pluto.Within the past year there has been a big improvement in our knowledge ofthe scale of the solar system. At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory the distance fromthe earth to Venus was measured quite accurately by a direct radar observation.This, of course, is a still diﬀerent type of inferred distance. We say we know thespeed at which light travels (and therefore, at which radar waves travel), and weassume that it is the same speed everywhere between the earth and Venus. Wesend the radio wave out, and count the time until the reﬂected wave comes back.From the time we infer a distance, assuming we know the speed. We have reallyanother deﬁnition of a measurement of distance.

How do we measure the distance to a star, which is much farther away?Fortunately, we can go back to our triangulation method, because the earth

Fig. 5-5. The distance of nearby stars can be measured by triangula-

tion, using the diameter of the earth’s orbit as a baseline.

moving around the sun gives us a large baseline for measurements of objectsoutside the solar system. If we focus a telescope on a star in summer and inwinter, we might hope to determine these two angles accurately enough to beable to measure the distance to a star.

What if the stars are too far away for us to use triangulation? Astronomersare always inventing new ways of measuring distance. They ﬁnd, for example,that they can estimate the size and brightness of a star by its color. The color andbrightness of many nearby stars—whose distances are known by triangulation—have been measured, and it is found that there is a smooth relationship between thecolor and the intrinsic brightness of stars (in most cases). If one now measures thecolor of a distant star, one may use the color-brightness relationship to determinethe intrinsic brightness of the star. By measuring how bright the star appears tous at the earth (or perhaps we should say how dim it appears), we can computehow far away it is. (For a given intrinsic brightness, the apparent brightnessdecreases with the square of the distance.) A nice conﬁrmation of the correctnessof this method of measuring stellar distances is given by the results obtained forgroups of stars known as globular clusters. A photograph of such a group is shownin Fig. 5-6. Just from looking at the photograph one is convinced that thesestars are all together. The same result is obtained from distance measurementsby the color-brightness method.

A study of many globular clusters gives another important bit of information.It is found that there is a high concentration of such clusters in a certain part of

5-12

the sky and that most of them are about the same distance from us. Couplingthis information with other evidence, we conclude that this concentration ofclusters marks the center of our galaxy. We then know the distance to the centerof the galaxy—about 1020 meters.

Knowing the size of our own galaxy, we have a key to the measurement ofstill larger distances—the distances to other galaxies. Figure 5-7 is a photographof a galaxy, which has much the same shape as our own. Probably it is thesame size, too. (Other evidence supports the idea that galaxies are all about thesame size.) If it is the same size as ours, we can tell its distance. We measurethe angle it subtends in the sky; we know its diameter, and we compute itsdistance—triangulation again!

Photographs of exceedingly distant galaxies have recently been obtained withthe giant Palomar telescope. One is shown in Fig. 5-8. It is now believed thatsome of these galaxies are about halfway to the limit of the universe—1026 metersaway—the largest distance we can contemplate!

5-13

Fig. 5-7. A spiral galaxy like our own. Presuming that its diameteris similar to that of our own galaxy, we may compute its distance fromits apparent size. It is 30 million light-years (3 × 1023 meters) from theearth.

5-7 Short distancesNow let’s think about smaller distances. Subdividing the meter is easy.Without much diﬃculty we can mark oﬀ one thousand equal spaces which add upto one meter. With somewhat more diﬃculty, but in a similar way (using a goodmicroscope), we can mark oﬀ a thousand equal subdivisions of the millimeterto make a scale of microns (millionths of a meter). It is diﬃcult to continue tosmaller scales, because we cannot「see」objects smaller than the wavelength ofvisible light (about 5 × 10−7 meter).We need not stop, however, at what we can see. With an electron microscope,we can continue the process by making photographs on a still smaller scale,say down to 10−8 meter (Fig. 5-9). By indirect measurements—by a kind oftriangulation on a microscopic scale—we can continue to measure to smaller andsmaller scales. First, from an observation of the way light of short wavelength (x-radiation) is reﬂected from a pattern of marks of known separation, we determine

5-14

the arrow), measured by the 200-inch telescope to date (1960).

the wavelength of the light vibrations. Then, from the pattern of the scatteringof the same light from a crystal, we can determine the relative location of theatoms in the crystal, obtaining results which agree with the atomic spacings alsodetermined by chemical means. We ﬁnd in this way that atoms have a diameterof about 10−10 meter.

There is a large「gap」in physical sizes between the typical atomic dimensionof about 10−10 meter and the nuclear dimensions 10−15 meter, 10−5 times smaller.For nuclear sizes, a diﬀerent way of measuring size becomes convenient. Wemeasure the apparent area, σ, called the eﬀective cross section. If we wish theradius, we can obtain it from σ = πr2, since nuclei are nearly spherical.

Measurement of a nuclear cross section can be made by passing a beam ofhigh-energy particles through a thin slab of material and observing the numberof particles which do not get through. These high-energy particles will plow rightthrough the thin cloud of electrons and will be stopped or deﬂected only if theyhit the concentrated weight of a nucleus. Suppose we have a piece of material1 centimeter thick. There will be about 108 atomic layers. But the nuclei areso small that there is little chance that any nucleus will lie behind another. We

might imagine that a highly magniﬁed view of the situation—looking along theparticle beam—would look like Fig. 5-10.

Fig. 5-10. Imagined view through a block of carbon 1 cm thick if only

the nuclei were observed.

The chance that a very small particle will hit a nucleus on the trip through isjust the total area covered by the proﬁles of the nuclei divided by the total areain the picture. Suppose that we know that in an area A of our slab of materialthere are N atoms (each with one nucleus, of course). Then the fraction of the

5-17

area「covered」by the nuclei is N σ/A. Now let the number of particles of ourbeam which arrive at the slab be n1 and the number which come out the otherside be n2. The fraction which do not get through is (n1 − n2)/n1, which shouldjust equal the fraction of the area covered. We can obtain the radius of thenucleus from the equation*

πr2 = σ = AN

n1 − n2

n1

.

From such an experiment we ﬁnd that the radii of the nuclei are from about1 to 6 times 10−15 meter. The length unit 10−15 meter is called the fermi, inhonor of Enrico Fermi (1901–1954).What do we ﬁnd if we go to smaller distances? Can we measure smallerdistances? Such questions are not yet answerable. It has been suggested thatthe still unsolved mystery of nuclear forces may be unravelled only by somemodiﬁcation of our idea of space, or measurement, at such small distances.

It might be thought that it would be a good idea to use some natural length asour unit of length—say the radius of the earth or some fraction of it. The meterwas originally intended to be such a unit and was deﬁned to be (π/2)×10−7 timesthe earth’s radius. It is neither convenient nor very accurate to determine theunit of length in this way. For a long time it has been agreed internationally thatthe meter would be deﬁned as the distance between two scratches on a bar keptin a special laboratory in France. More recently, it has been realized that thisdeﬁnition is neither as precise as would be useful, nor as permanent or universal asone would like. It is currently being considered that a new deﬁnition be adopted,an agreed-upon (arbitrary) number of wavelengths of a chosen spectral line.

Measurements of distance and of time give results which depend on theobserver. Two observers moving with respect to each other will not measurethe same distances and times when measuring what appear to be the samethings. Distances and time intervals have diﬀerent magnitudes, depending on thecoordinate system (or「frame of reference」) used for making the measurements.We shall study this subject in more detail in a later chapter.

* This equation is right only if the area covered by the nuclei is a small fraction of the total,i.e., if (n1 − n2)/n1 is much less than 1. Otherwise we must make a correction for the fact thatsome nuclei will be partly obscured by the nuclei in front of them.

5-18

Perfectly precise measurements of distances or times are not permitted bythe laws of nature. We have mentioned earlier that the errors in a measurementof the position of an object must be at least as large as

∆x ≥ /2∆p,

where  is a small fundamental physical constant called the reduced Planckconstant and ∆p is the error in our knowledge of the momentum (mass timesvelocity) of the object whose position we are measuring. It was also mentionedthat the uncertainty in position measurements is related to the wave nature ofparticles.

The relativity of space and time implies that time measurements have also a

minimum error, given in fact by

∆t ≥ /2∆E,

where ∆E is the error in our knowledge of the energy of the process whose timeperiod we are measuring. If we wish to know more precisely when somethinghappened we must know less about what happened, because our knowledge ofthe energy involved will be less. The time uncertainty is also related to the wavenature of matter.
