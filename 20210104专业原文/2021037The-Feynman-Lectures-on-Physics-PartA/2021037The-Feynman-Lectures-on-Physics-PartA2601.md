Optics: The Principle of Least Time

26-1 LightThis is the ﬁrst of a number of chapters on the subject of electromagneticradiation. Light, with which we see, is only one small part of a vast spectrum ofthe same kind of thing, the various parts of this spectrum being distinguished bydiﬀerent values of a certain quantity which varies. This variable quantity could becalled the「wavelength.」As it varies in the visible spectrum, the light apparentlychanges color from red to violet. If we explore the spectrum systematically, fromlong wavelengths toward shorter ones, we would begin with what are usually calledradiowaves. Radiowaves are technically available in a wide range of wavelengths,some even longer than those used in regular broadcasts; regular broadcasts havewavelengths corresponding to about 500 meters. Then there are the so-called「short waves,」i.e., radar waves, millimeter waves, and so on. There are no actualboundaries between one range of wavelengths and another, because nature didnot present us with sharp edges. The number associated with a given name forthe waves are only approximate and, of course, so are the names we give to thediﬀerent ranges.

Then, a long way down through the millimeter waves, we come to whatwe call the infrared, and thence to the visible spectrum. Then going in theother direction, we get into a region which is called the ultraviolet. Where theultraviolet stops, the x-rays begin, but we cannot deﬁne precisely where thisis; it is roughly at 10−8 m, or 10−2 µ. These are「soft」x-rays; then there areordinary x-rays and very hard x-rays; then γ-rays, and so on, for smaller andsmaller values of this dimension called the wavelength.Within this vast range of wavelengths, there are three or more regions ofapproximation which are especially interesting. In one of these, a condition existsin which the wavelengths involved are very small compared with the dimensionsof the equipment available for their study; furthermore, the photon energies,

26-1

using the quantum theory, are small compared with the energy sensitivity of theequipment. Under these conditions we can make a rough ﬁrst approximationby a method called geometrical optics. If, on the other hand, the wavelengthsare comparable to the dimensions of the equipment, which is diﬃcult to arrangewith visible light but easier with radiowaves, and if the photon energies are stillnegligibly small, then a very useful approximation can be made by studying thebehavior of the waves, still disregarding the quantum mechanics. This method isbased on the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, which will be discussedin a later chapter. Next, if we go to very short wavelengths, where we candisregard the wave character but the photons have a very large energy comparedwith the sensitivity of our equipment, things get simple again. This is the simplephoton picture, which we will describe only very roughly. The complete picture,which uniﬁes the whole thing into one model, will not be available to us for along time.

In this chapter our discussion is limited to the geometrical optics region, inwhich we forget about the wavelength and the photon character of the light,which will all be explained in due time. We do not even bother to say whatthe light is, but just ﬁnd out how it behaves on a large scale compared withthe dimensions of interest. All this must be said in order to emphasize the factthat what we are going to talk about is only a very crude approximation; thisis one of the chapters that we shall have to「unlearn」again. But we shall veryquickly unlearn it, because we shall almost immediately go on to a more accuratemethod.

Although geometrical optics is just an approximation, it is of very greatimportance technically and of great interest historically. We shall present thissubject more historically than some of the others in order to give some idea ofthe development of a physical theory or physical idea.

First, light is, of course, familiar to everybody, and has been familiar sincetime immemorial. Now one problem is, by what process do we see light? Therehave been many theories, but it ﬁnally settled down to one, which is that thereis something which enters the eye—which bounces oﬀ objects into the eye. Wehave heard that idea so long that we accept it, and it is almost impossible forus to realize that very intelligent men have proposed contrary theories—thatsomething comes out of the eye and feels for the object, for example. Some otherimportant observations are that, as light goes from one place to another, it goesin straight lines, if there is nothing in the way, and that the rays do not seemto interfere with one another. That is, light is crisscrossing in all directions in

26-2

the room, but the light that is passing across our line of vision does not aﬀectthe light that comes to us from some object. This was once a most powerfulargument against the corpuscular theory; it was used by Huygens. If light werelike a lot of arrows shooting along, how could other arrows go through them soeasily? Such philosophical arguments are not of much weight. One could alwayssay that light is made up of arrows which go through each other!

26-2 Reﬂection and refractionThe discussion above gives enough of the basic idea of geometrical optics—nowwe have to go a little further into the quantitative features. Thus far we have lightgoing only in straight lines between two points; now let us study the behaviorof light when it hits various materials. The simplest object is a mirror, and thelaw for a mirror is that when the light hits the mirror, it does not continue in astraight line, but bounces oﬀ the mirror into a new straight line, which changeswhen we change the inclination of the mirror. The question for the ancientswas, what is the relation between the two angles involved? This is a very simplerelation, discovered long ago. The light striking a mirror travels in such a waythat the two angles, between each beam and the mirror, are equal. For somereason it is customary to measure the angles from the normal to the mirrorsurface. Thus the so-called law of reﬂection is

θi = θr.

(26.1)

That is a simple enough proposition, but a more diﬃcult problem is encoun-tered when light goes from one medium into another, for example from air intowater; here also, we see that it does not go in a straight line. In the water theray is at an inclination to its path in the air; if we change the angle θi so thatit comes down more nearly vertically, then the angle of「breakage」is not as

Fig. 26-1. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reﬂection.

great. But if we tilt the beam of light at quite an angle, then the deviation angleis very large. The question is, what is the relation of one angle to the other?This also puzzled the ancients for a long time, and here they never found theanswer! It is, however, one of the few places in all of Greek physics that onemay ﬁnd any experimental results listed. Claudius Ptolemy made a list of theangle in water for each of a number of diﬀerent angles in air. Table 26-1 showsthe angles in the air, in degrees, and the corresponding angle as measured inthe water. (Ordinarily it is said that Greek scientists never did any experiments.But it would be impossible to obtain this table of values without knowing theright law, except by experiment. It should be noted, however, that these donot represent independent careful measurements for each angle but only somenumbers interpolated from a few measurements, for they all ﬁt perfectly on aparabola.)

26-4

This, then, is one of the important steps in the development of physical law:ﬁrst we observe an eﬀect, then we measure it and list it in a table; then we tryto ﬁnd the rule by which one thing can be connected with another. The abovenumerical table was made in 140 a.d., but it was not until 1621 that someoneﬁnally found the rule connecting the two angles! The rule, found by WillebrordSnell, a Dutch mathematician, is as follows: if θi is the angle in air and θr is theangle in the water, then it turns out that the sine of θi is equal to some constantmultiple of the sine of θr:(26.2)For water the number n is approximately 1.33. Equation (26.2) is called Snell’slaw; it permits us to predict how the light is going to bend when it goes from airinto water. Table 26-2 shows the angles in air and in water according to Snell’slaw. Note the remarkable agreement with Ptolemy’s list.

sin θi = n sin θr.

26-3 Fermat’s principle of least timeNow in the further development of science, we want more than just a formula.First we have an observation, then we have numbers that we measure, then wehave a law which summarizes all the numbers. But the real glory of science isthat we can ﬁnd a way of thinking such that the law is evident.

The ﬁrst way of thinking that made the law about the behavior of light evidentwas discovered by Fermat in about 1650, and it is called the principle of leasttime, or Fermat’s principle. His idea is this: that out of all possible paths that itmight take to get from one point to another, light takes the path which requiresthe shortest time.

Let us ﬁrst show that this is true for the case of the mirror, that this simpleprinciple contains both the law of straight-line propagation and the law for themirror. So, we are growing in our understanding! Let us try to ﬁnd the solutionto the following problem. In Fig. 26-3 are shown two points, A and B, and aplane mirror, M M0. What is the way to get from A to B in the shortest time?The answer is to go straight from A to B! But if we add the extra rule that thelight has to strike the mirror and come back in the shortest time, the answer isnot so easy. One way would be to go as quickly as possible to the mirror andthen go to B, on the path ADB. Of course, we then have a long path DB. If wemove over a little to the right, to E, we slightly increase the ﬁrst distance, butwe greatly decrease the second one, and so the total path length, and therefore

26-5

Fig. 26-3. Illustration of the principle of least time.

the travel time, is less. How can we ﬁnd the point C for which the time is theshortest? We can ﬁnd it very nicely by a geometrical trick.

We construct on the other side of M M0 an artiﬁcial point B0, which is thesame distance below the plane M M0 as the point B is above the plane. Thenwe draw the line EB0. Now because BF M is a right angle and BF = F B0, EBis equal to EB0. Therefore the sum of the two distances, AE + EB, which isproportional to the time it will take if the light travels with constant velocity,is also the sum of the two lengths AE + EB0. Therefore the problem becomes,when is the sum of these two lengths the least? The answer is easy: when theline goes through point C as a straight line from A to B0! In other words, wehave to ﬁnd the point where we go toward the artiﬁcial point, and that will bethe correct one. Now if ACB0 is a straight line, then angle BCF is equal toangle B0CF and thence to angle ACM. Thus the statement that the angle ofincidence equals the angle of reﬂection is equivalent to the statement that thelight goes to the mirror in such a way that it comes back to the point B in theleast possible time. Originally, the statement was made by Hero of Alexandriathat the light travels in such a way that it goes to the mirror and to the otherpoint in the shortest possible distance, so it is not a modern theory. It was thisthat inspired Fermat to suggest to himself that perhaps refraction operated on asimilar basis. But for refraction, light obviously does not use the path of shortestdistance, so Fermat tried the idea that it takes the shortest time.

Before we go on to analyze refraction, we should make one more remark aboutthe mirror. If we have a source of light at the point B and it sends light toward the mirror, then we see that the light which goes to A from the point Bcomes to A in exactly the same manner as it would have come to A if there were

26-6

an object at B0, and no mirror. Now of course the eye detects only the lightwhich enters it physically, so if we have an object at B and a mirror which makesthe light come into the eye in exactly the same manner as it would have comeinto the eye if the object were at B0, then the eye-brain system interprets that,assuming it does not know too much, as being an object at B0. So the illusionthat there is an object behind the mirror is merely due to the fact that the lightwhich is entering the eye is entering in exactly the same manner, physically, as itwould have entered had there been an object back there (except for the dirt onthe mirror, and our knowledge of the existence of the mirror, and so on, which iscorrected in the brain).

Now let us demonstrate that the principle of least time will give Snell’s lawof refraction. We must, however, make an assumption about the speed of light inwater. We shall assume that the speed of light in water is lower than the speedof light in air by a certain factor, n.

Fig. 26-4. Illustration of Fermat’s principle for refraction.

In Fig. 26-4, our problem is again to go from A to B in the shortest time.To illustrate that the best thing to do is not just to go in a straight line, let usimagine that a beautiful girl has fallen out of a boat, and she is screaming forhelp in the water at point B. The line marked x is the shoreline. We are atpoint A on land, and we see the accident, and we can run and can also swim.But we can run faster than we can swim. What do we do? Do we go in a straightline? (Yes, no doubt!) However, by using a little more intelligence we wouldrealize that it would be advantageous to travel a little greater distance on land

26-7

Fig. 26-5. The minimum time corresponds to point C, but nearby

points correspond to nearly the same time.

in order to decrease the distance in the water, because we go so much slower inthe water. (Following this line of reasoning out, we would say the right thingto do is to compute very carefully what should be done!) At any rate, let us tryto show that the ﬁnal solution to the problem is the path ACB, and that thispath takes the shortest time of all possible ones. If it is the shortest path, thatmeans that if we take any other, it will be longer. So, if we were to plot the timeit takes against the position of point X, we would get a curve something likethat shown in Fig. 26-5, where point C corresponds to the shortest of all possibletimes. This means that if we move the point X to points near C, in the ﬁrstapproximation there is essentially no change in time because the slope is zeroat the bottom of the curve. So our way of ﬁnding the law will be to considerthat we move the place by a very small amount, and to demand that there beessentially no change in time. (Of course there is an inﬁnitesimal change of asecond order; we ought to have a positive increase for displacements in eitherdirection from C.) So we consider a nearby point X and we calculate how longit would take to go from A to B by the two paths, and compare the new pathwith the old path. It is very easy to do. We want the diﬀerence, of course, to benearly zero if the distance XC is short. First, look at the path on land. If wedraw a perpendicular XE, we see that this path is shortened by the amount EC.Let us say we gain by not having to go that extra distance. On the other hand,in the water, by drawing a corresponding perpendicular, CF, we ﬁnd that wehave to go the extra distance XF, and that is what we lose. Or, in time, wegain the time it would have taken to go the distance EC, but we lose the time itwould have taken to go the distance XF. Those times must be equal since, inthe ﬁrst approximation, there is to be no change in time. But supposing that in

26-8

the water the speed is 1/n times as fast as in air, then we must have

(26.3)Therefore we see that when we have the right point, XC sin EXC = n·XC sin XCFor, cancelling the common hypotenuse length XC and noting that

EC = n · XF.

EXC = ECN = θi

we have

and

XCF ≈ BCN0 = θr

(when X is near C),

sin θi = n sin θr.

(26.4)

So we see that to get from one point to another in the least time when the ratioof speeds is n, the light should enter at such an angle that the ratio of the sinesof the angles θi and θr is the ratio of the speeds in the two media.

26-4 Applications of Fermat’s principleNow let us consider some of the interesting consequences of the principle ofleast time. First is the principle of reciprocity. If to go from A to B we have foundthe path of the least time, then to go in the opposite direction (assuming thatlight goes at the same speed in any direction), the shortest time will be the samepath, and therefore, if light can be sent one way, it can be sent the other way.An example of interest is a glass block with plane parallel faces, set at anangle to a light beam. Light, in going through the block from a point A to apoint B (Fig. 26-6) does not go through in a straight line, but instead it decreasesthe time in the block by making the angle in the block less inclined, although itloses a little bit in the air. The beam is simply displaced parallel to itself becausethe angles in and out are the same.

A third interesting phenomenon is the fact that when we see the sun setting,it is already below the horizon! It does not look as though it is below the horizon,but it is (Fig. 26-7). The earth’s atmosphere is thin at the top and dense at thebottom. Light travels more slowly in air than it does in a vacuum, and so thelight of the sun can get to point S beyond the horizon more quickly if, insteadof just going in a straight line, it avoids the dense regions where it goes slowlyby getting through them at a steeper tilt. When it appears to go below thehorizon, it is actually already well below the horizon. Another example of thisphenomenon is the mirage that one often sees while driving on hot roads. One

block.

sees「water」on the road, but when he gets there, it is as dry as the desert! Thephenomenon is the following. What we are really seeing is the sky light「reﬂected」on the road: light from the sky, heading for the road, can end up in the eye, asshown in Fig. 26-8. Why? The air is very hot just above the road but it is coolerup higher. Hotter air is more expanded than cooler air and is thinner, and thisdecreases the speed of light less. That is to say, light goes faster in the hot regionthan in the cool region. Therefore, instead of the light deciding to come in thestraightforward way, it also has a least-time path by which it goes into the regionwhere it goes faster for awhile, in order to save time. So, it can go in a curve.

Fig. 26-9. An optical「black box.」

As another important example of the principle of least time, suppose thatwe would like to arrange a situation where we have all the light that comes outof one point, P, collected back together at another point, P 0 (Fig. 26-9). Thatmeans, of course, that the light can go in a straight line from P to P 0. That is allright. But how can we arrange that not only does it go straight, but also so thatthe light starting out from P toward Q also ends up at P 0? We want to bring allthe light back to what we call a focus. How? If the light always takes the path ofleast time, then certainly it should not want to go over all these other paths. Theonly way that the light can be perfectly satisﬁed to take several adjacent pathsis to make those times exactly equal! Otherwise, it would select the one of leasttime. Therefore the problem of making a focusing system is merely to arrange adevice so that it takes the same time for the light to go on all the diﬀerent paths!This is easy to do. Suppose that we had a piece of glass in which light goesslower than it does in the air (Fig. 26-10). Now consider a ray which goes in air inthe path P QP 0. That is a longer path than from P directly to P 0 and no doubttakes a longer time. But if we were to insert a piece of glass of just the rightthickness (we shall later ﬁgure out how thick) it might exactly compensate theexcess time that it would take the light to go at an angle! In those circumstances

26-11

Fig. 26-10. A focusing optical system.

we can arrange that the time the light takes to go straight through is the sameas the time it takes to go in the path P QP 0. Likewise, if we take a ray P RR0P 0which is partly inclined, it is not quite as long as P QP 0, and we do not haveto compensate as much as for the straight one, but we do have to compensatesomewhat. We end up with a piece of glass that looks like Fig. 26-10. With thisshape, all the light which comes from P will go to P 0. This, of course, is wellknown to us, and we call such a device a converging lens. In the next chapter weshall actually calculate what shape the lens has to have to make a perfect focus.

Fig. 26-11. An ellipsoidal mirror.

Take another example: suppose we wish to arrange some mirrors so that thelight from P always goes to P 0 (Fig. 26-11). On any path, it goes to some mirrorand comes back, and all times must be equal. Here the light always travels inair, so the time and the distance are proportional. Therefore the statement thatall the times are the same is the same as the statement that the total distance isthe same. Thus the sum of the two distances r1 and r2 must be a constant. Anellipse is that curve which has the property that the sum of the distances fromtwo points is a constant for every point on the ellipse; thus we can be sure thatthe light from one focus will come to the other.

The same principle works for gathering the light of a star. The great 200-inchPalomar telescope is built on the following principle. Imagine a star billions of

26-12

Fig. 26-12. A paraboloidal mirror.

miles away; we would like to cause all the light that comes in to come to a focus.Of course we cannot draw the rays that go all the way up to the star, but westill want to check whether the times are equal. Of course we know that whenthe various rays have arrived at some plane KK0, perpendicular to the rays, allthe times in this plane are equal (Fig. 26-12). The rays must then come downto the mirror and proceed toward P 0 in equal times. That is, we must ﬁnd acurve which has the property that the sum of the distances XX0 + X0P 0 is aconstant, no matter where X is chosen. An easy way to ﬁnd it is to extend thelength of the line XX0 down to a plane LL0. Now if we arrange our curve so thatA0A00 = A0P 0, B0B00 = B0P 0, C0C00 = C0P 0, and so on, we will have our curve,because then of course, AA0 + A0P 0 = AA0 + A0A00 will be constant. Thus ourcurve is the locus of all points equidistant from a line and a point. Such a curveis called a parabola; the mirror is made in the shape of a parabola.

The above examples illustrate the principle upon which such optical devicescan be designed. The exact curves can be calculated using the principle that, tofocus perfectly, the travel times must be exactly equal for all light rays, as wellas being less than for any other nearby path.

We shall discuss these focusing optical devices further in the next chapter; letus now discuss the further development of the theory. When a new theoreticalprinciple is developed, such as the principle of least time, our ﬁrst inclinationmight be to say,「Well, that is very pretty; it is delightful; but the question is,does it help at all in understanding the physics?」Someone may say,「Yes, lookat how many things we can now understand!」Another says,「Very well, but Ican understand mirrors, too. I need a curve such that every tangent plane makes

26-13

equal angles with the two rays. I can ﬁgure out a lens, too, because every raythat comes to it is bent through an angle given by Snell’s law.」Evidently thestatement of least time and the statement that angles are equal on reﬂection,and that the sines of the angles are proportional on refraction, are the same. Sois it merely a philosophical question, or one of beauty? There can be argumentson both sides.

However, the importance of a powerful principle is that it predicts new things.It is easy to show that there are a number of new things predicted by Fermat’sprinciple. First, suppose that there are three media, glass, water, and air, andwe perform a refraction experiment and measure the index n for one mediumagainst another. Let us call n12 the index of air (1) against water (2); n13 theindex of air (1) against glass (3). If we measured water against glass, we shouldﬁnd another index, which we shall call n23. But there is no a priori reason whythere should be any connection between n12, n13, and n23. On the other hand,according to the idea of least time, there is a deﬁnite relationship. The index n12is the ratio of two things, the speed in air to the speed in water; n13 is the ratioof the speed in air to the speed in glass; n23 is the ratio of the speed in water tothe speed in glass. Therefore we cancel out the air, and get

n23 = v2v3

= v1/v3v1/v2

= n13n12

.

(26.5)

In other words, we predict that the index for a new pair of materials can beobtained from the indexes of the individual materials, both against air or againstvacuum. So if we measure the speed of light in all materials, and from this get asingle number for each material, namely its index relative to vacuum, called ni(n1 is the speed in air relative to the speed in vacuum, etc.), then our formula iseasy. The index for any two materials i and j is

nij = vivj

= njni

.

(26.6)

Using only Snell’s law, there is no basis for a prediction of this kind.* But ofcourse this prediction works. The relation (26.5) was known very early, and wasa very strong argument for the principle of least time.

* Although it can be deduced if the additional assumption is made that adding a layer ofone substance to the surface of another does not change the eventual angle of refraction in thelatter material.

26-14

Another argument for the principle of least time, another prediction, is thatif we measure the speed of light in water, it will be lower than in air. This is aprediction of a completely diﬀerent type. It is a brilliant prediction, because allwe have so far measured are angles; here we have a theoretical prediction whichis quite diﬀerent from the observations from which Fermat deduced the idea ofleast time. It turns out, in fact, that the speed in water is slower than the speedin air, by just the proportion that is needed to get the right index!

26-5 A more precise statement of Fermat’s principleActually, we must make the statement of the principle of least time a littlemore accurately. It was not stated correctly above. It is incorrectly called theprinciple of least time and we have gone along with the incorrect description forconvenience, but we must now see what the correct statement is. Suppose we hada mirror as in Fig. 26-3. What makes the light think it has to go to the mirror?The path of least time is clearly AB. So some people might say,「Sometimes it isa maximum time.」It is not a maximum time, because certainly a curved pathwould take a still longer time! The correct statement is the following: a ray goingin a certain particular path has the property that if we make a small change (saya one percent shift) in the ray in any manner whatever, say in the location atwhich it comes to the mirror, or the shape of the curve, or anything, there willbe no ﬁrst-order change in the time; there will be only a second-order change inthe time. In other words, the principle is that light takes a path such that thereare many other paths nearby which take almost exactly the same time.The following is another diﬃculty with the principle of least time, and onewhich people who do not like this kind of a theory could never stomach. WithSnell’s theory we can「understand」light. Light goes along, it sees a surface, itbends because it does something at the surface. The idea of causality, that it goesfrom one point to another, and another, and so on, is easy to understand. Butthe principle of least time is a completely diﬀerent philosophical principle aboutthe way nature works. Instead of saying it is a causal thing, that when we do onething, something else happens, and so on, it says this: we set up the situation,and light decides which is the shortest time, or the extreme one, and choosesthat path. But what does it do, how does it ﬁnd out? Does it smell the nearbypaths, and check them against each other? The answer is, yes, it does, in a way.That is the feature which is, of course, not known in geometrical optics, andwhich is involved in the idea of wavelength; the wavelength tells us approximately

26-15

Fig. 26-13. The passage of radiowaves through a narrow slit.

how far away the light must「smell」the path in order to check it. It is hardto demonstrate this fact on a large scale with light, because the wavelengthsare so terribly short. But with radiowaves, say 3-cm waves, the distances overwhich the radiowaves are checking are larger. If we have a source of radiowaves,a detector, and a slit, as in Fig. 26-13, the rays of course go from S to D becauseit is a straight line, and if we close down the slit it is all right—they still go. Butnow if we move the detector aside to D0, the waves will not go through the wideslit from S to D0, because they check several paths nearby, and say,「No, myfriend, those all correspond to diﬀerent times.」On the other hand, if we preventthe radiation from checking the paths by closing the slit down to a very narrowcrack, then there is but one path available, and the radiation takes it! With anarrow slit, more radiation reaches D0 than reaches it with a wide slit!

One can do the same thing with light, but it is hard to demonstrate on a largescale. The eﬀect can be seen under the following simple conditions. Find a small,bright light, say an unfrosted bulb in a street light far away or the reﬂection ofthe sun in a curved automobile bumper. Then put two ﬁngers in front of one eye,so as to look through the crack, and squeeze the light to zero very gently. Youwill see that the image of the light, which was a little dot before, becomes quiteelongated, and even stretches into a long line. The reason is that the ﬁngers arevery close together, and the light which is supposed to come in a straight lineis spread out at an angle, so that when it comes into the eye it comes in fromseveral directions. Also you will notice, if you are very careful, side maxima, a lotof fringes along the edges too. Furthermore, the whole thing is colored. All of thiswill be explained in due time, but for the present it is a demonstration that lightdoes not always go in straight lines, and it is one that is very easily performed.

26-16

26-6 How it worksFinally, we give a very crude view of what actually happens, how the wholething really works, from what we now believe is the correct, quantum-dynamicallyaccurate viewpoint, but of course only qualitatively described. In following thelight from A to B in Fig. 26-3, we ﬁnd that the light does not seem to be in theform of waves at all. Instead the rays seem to be made up of photons, and theyactually produce clicks in a photon counter, if we are using one. The brightnessof the light is proportional to the average number of photons that come in persecond, and what we calculate is the chance that a photon gets from A to B, sayby hitting the mirror. The law for that chance is the following very strange one.Take any path and ﬁnd the time for that path; then make a complex number,or draw a little complex vector, ρeiθ, whose angle θ is proportional to the time.The number of turns per second is the frequency of the light. Now take anotherpath; it has, for instance, a diﬀerent time, so the vector for it is turned througha diﬀerent angle—the angle being always proportional to the time. Take all theavailable paths and add on a little vector for each one; then the answer is thatthe chance of arrival of the photon is proportional to the square of the length ofthe ﬁnal vector, from the beginning to the end!

Now let us show how this implies the principle of least time for a mirror. Weconsider all rays, all possible paths ADB, AEB, ACB, etc., in Fig. 26-3. Thepath ADB makes a certain small contribution, but the next path, AEB, takesa quite diﬀerent time, so its angle θ is quite diﬀerent. Let us say that point Ccorresponds to minimum time, where if we change the paths the times do notchange. So for awhile the times do change, and then they begin to change less andless as we get near point C (Fig. 26-14). So the arrows which we have to add arecoming almost exactly at the same angle for awhile near C, and then graduallythe time begins to increase again, and the phases go around the other way, and so

on. Eventually, we have quite a tight knot. The total probability is the distancefrom one end to the other, squared. Almost all of that accumulated probabilityoccurs in the region where all the arrows are in the same direction (or in the samephase). All the contributions from the paths which have very diﬀerent times aswe change the path, cancel themselves out by pointing in diﬀerent directions.That is why, if we hide the extreme parts of the mirror, it still reﬂects almostexactly the same, because all we did was to take out a piece of the diagram insidethe spiral ends, and that makes only a very small change in the light. So this isthe relationship between the ultimate picture of photons with a probability ofarrival depending on an accumulation of arrows, and the principle of least time.
