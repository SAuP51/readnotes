The Relation of Wave andParticle Viewpoints

38-1 Probability wave amplitudesIn this chapter we shall discuss the relationship of the wave and particleviewpoints. We already know, from the last chapter, that neither the waveviewpoint nor the particle viewpoint is correct. Usually we have tried to presentthings accurately, or at least precisely enough that they will not have to bechanged when we learn more—it may be extended, but it will not be changed!But when we try to talk about the wave picture or the particle picture, both areapproximate, and both will change. Therefore what we learn in this chapter willnot be accurate in a certain sense; it is a kind of half-intuitive argument that willbe made more precise later, but certain things will be changed a little bit whenwe interpret them correctly in quantum mechanics. The reason for doing such athing, of course, is that we are not going to go directly into quantum mechanics,but we want to have at least some idea of the kinds of eﬀects that we will ﬁnd.Furthermore, all our experiences are with waves and with particles, and so it israther handy to use the wave and particle ideas to get some understanding ofwhat happens in given circumstances before we know the complete mathematicsof the quantum-mechanical amplitudes. We shall try to illustrate the weakestplaces as we go along, but most of it is very nearly correct—it is just a matter ofinterpretation.

First of all, we know that the new way of representing the world in quantummechanics—the new framework—is to give an amplitude for every event that canoccur, and if the event involves the reception of one particle then we can give theamplitude to ﬁnd that one particle at diﬀerent places and at diﬀerent times. Theprobability of ﬁnding the particle is then proportional to the absolute square ofthe amplitude. In general, the amplitude to ﬁnd a particle in diﬀerent places atdiﬀerent times varies with position and time.

38-1

In a special case the amplitude varies sinusoidally in space and time likeei(ωt−k·r) (do not forget that these amplitudes are complex numbers, not realnumbers) and involves a deﬁnite frequency ω and wave number k. Then it turnsout that this corresponds to a classical limiting situation where we would havebelieved that we have a particle whose energy E was known and is related to thefrequency by(38.1)

E = ω,

and whose momentum p is also known and is related to the wave number by

p = k.

(38.2)

This means that the idea of a particle is limited. The idea of a particle—its location, its momentum, etc.—which we use so much, is in certain waysunsatisfactory. For instance, if an amplitude to ﬁnd a particle at diﬀerent placesis given by ei(ωt−k·r), whose absolute square is a constant, that would mean thatthe probability of ﬁnding a particle is the same at all points. That means we donot know where it is—it can be anywhere—there is a great uncertainty in itslocation.On the other hand, if the position of a particle is more or less well known andwe can predict it fairly accurately, then the probability of ﬁnding it in diﬀerentplaces must be conﬁned to a certain region, whose length we call ∆x. Outsidethis region, the probability is zero. Now this probability is the absolute square ofan amplitude, and if the absolute square is zero, the amplitude is also zero, sothat we have a wave train whose length is ∆x (Fig. 38-1), and the wavelength(the distance between nodes of the waves in the train) of that wave train is whatcorresponds to the particle momentum.

Here we encounter a strange thing about waves; a very simple thing whichhas nothing to do with quantum mechanics strictly. It is something that anybodywho works with waves, even if he knows no quantum mechanics, knows: namely,we cannot deﬁne a unique wavelength for a short wave train. Such a wave train

Fig. 38-1. A wave packet of length ∆x.

38-2

does not have a deﬁnite wavelength; there is an indeﬁniteness in the wave numberthat is related to the ﬁnite length of the train, and thus there is an indeﬁnitenessin the momentum.

38-2 Measurement of position and momentumLet us consider two examples of this idea—to see the reason why there is anuncertainty in the position and/or the momentum, if quantum mechanics is right.We have also seen before that if there were not such a thing—if it were possibleto measure the position and the momentum of anything simultaneously—wewould have a paradox; it is fortunate that we do not have such a paradox, andthe fact that such an uncertainty comes naturally from the wave picture showsthat everything is mutually consistent.

Fig. 38-2. Diﬀraction of particles passing through a slit.

Here is one example which shows the relationship between the position andthe momentum in a circumstance that is easy to understand. Suppose we have asingle slit, and particles are coming from very far away with a certain energy—sothat they are all coming essentially horizontally (Fig. 38-2). We are going toconcentrate on the vertical components of momentum. All of these particles havea certain horizontal momentum p0, say, in a classical sense. So, in the classicalsense, the vertical momentum py, before the particle goes through the hole, isdeﬁnitely known. The particle is moving neither up nor down, because it camefrom a source that is far away—and so the vertical momentum is of course zero.But now let us suppose that it goes through a hole whose width is B. Thenafter it has come out through the hole, we know the position vertically—the

38-3

y position—with considerable accuracy—namely ±B.* That is, the uncertaintyin position, ∆y, is of order B. Now we might also want to say, since we know themomentum is absolutely horizontal, that ∆py is zero; but that is wrong. We onceknew the momentum was horizontal, but we do not know it any more. Before theparticles passed through the hole, we did not know their vertical positions. Nowthat we have found the vertical position by having the particle come through thehole, we have lost our information on the vertical momentum! Why? Accordingto the wave theory, there is a spreading out, or diﬀraction, of the waves afterthey go through the slit, just as for light. Therefore there is a certain probabilitythat particles coming out of the slit are not coming exactly straight. The patternis spread out by the diﬀraction eﬀect, and the angle of spread, which we candeﬁne as the angle of the ﬁrst minimum, is a measure of the uncertainty in theﬁnal angle.

How does the pattern become spread? To say it is spread means that thereis some chance for the particle to be moving up or down, that is, to have acomponent of momentum up or down. We say chance and particle because wecan detect this diﬀraction pattern with a particle counter, and when the counterreceives the particle, say at C in Fig. 38-2, it receives the entire particle, so that,in a classical sense, the particle has a vertical momentum, in order to get fromthe slit up to C.To get a rough idea of the spread of the momentum, the vertical momentum pyhas a spread which is equal to p0 ∆θ, where p0 is the horizontal momentum.And how big is ∆θ in the spread-out pattern? We know that the ﬁrst minimumoccurs at an angle ∆θ such that the waves from one edge of the slit have to travelone wavelength farther than the waves from the other side—we worked thatout before (Chapter 30). Therefore ∆θ is λ/B, and so ∆py in this experimentis p0λ/B. Note that if we make B smaller and make a more accurate measurementof the position of the particle, the diﬀraction pattern gets wider. Remember,when we closed the slits on the experiment with the microwaves, we had moreintensity farther out. So the narrower we make the slit, the wider the patterngets, and the more is the likelihood that we would ﬁnd that the particle hassidewise momentum. Thus the uncertainty in the vertical momentum is inverselyproportional to the uncertainty of y. In fact, we see that the product of thetwo is equal to p0λ. But λ is the wavelength and p0 is the momentum, and in

* More precisely, the error in our knowledge of y is ±B/2. But we are now only interested

in the general idea, so we won’t worry about factors of 2.

38-4

accordance with quantum mechanics, the wavelength times the momentum isPlanck’s constant h. So we obtain the rule that the uncertainties in the verticalmomentum and in the vertical position have a product of the order h:

∆y ∆py ≥ /2.

(38.3)

We cannot prepare a system in which we know the vertical position of a particleand can predict how it will move vertically with greater certainty than givenby (38.3). That is, the uncertainty in the vertical momentum must exceed /2∆y,where ∆y is the uncertainty in our knowledge of the position.

Sometimes people say quantum mechanics is all wrong. When the particlearrived from the left, its vertical momentum was zero. And now that it has gonethrough the slit, its position is known. Both position and momentum seem to beknown with arbitrary accuracy. It is quite true that we can receive a particle, andon reception determine what its position is and what its momentum would havehad to have been to have gotten there. That is true, but that is not what theuncertainty relation (38.3) refers to. Equation (38.3) refers to the predictabilityof a situation, not remarks about the past. It does no good to say「I knew whatthe momentum was before it went through the slit, and now I know the position,」because now the momentum knowledge is lost. The fact that it went throughthe slit no longer permits us to predict the vertical momentum. We are talkingabout a predictive theory, not just measurements after the fact. So we must talkabout what we can predict.

Now let us take the thing the other way around. Let us take another exampleof the same phenomenon, a little more quantitatively. In the previous examplewe measured the momentum by a classical method. Namely, we considered thedirection and the velocity and the angles, etc., so we got the momentum byclassical analysis. But since momentum is related to wave number, there existsin nature still another way to measure the momentum of a particle—photon orotherwise—which has no classical analog, because it uses Eq. (38.2). We measurethe wavelengths of the waves. Let us try to measure momentum in this way.

Suppose we have a grating with a large number of lines (Fig. 38-3), and senda beam of particles at the grating. We have often discussed this problem:ifthe particles have a deﬁnite momentum, then we get a very sharp pattern in acertain direction, because of the interference. And we have also talked about howaccurately we can determine that momentum, that is to say, what the resolvingpower of such a grating is. Rather than derive it again, we refer to Chapter 30,

38-5

Fig. 38-3. Determination of momentum by using a diﬀraction grating.

where we found that the relative uncertainty in the wavelength that can bemeasured with a given grating is 1/N m, where N is the number of lines on thegrating and m is the order of the diﬀraction pattern. That is,

∆λ/λ = 1/N m.

Now formula (38.4) can be rewritten as

∆λ/λ2 = 1/N mλ = 1/L,

(38.4)

(38.5)

where L is the distance shown in Fig. 38-3. This distance is the diﬀerence betweenthe total distance that the particle or wave or whatever it is has to travel ifit is reﬂected from the bottom of the grating, and the distance that it has totravel if it is reﬂected from the top of the grating. That is, the waves which formthe diﬀraction pattern are waves which come from diﬀerent parts of the grating.The ﬁrst ones that arrive come from the bottom end of the grating, from thebeginning of the wave train, and the rest of them come from later parts of thewave train, coming from diﬀerent parts of the grating, until the last one ﬁnallyarrives, and that involves a point in the wave train a distance L behind the ﬁrstpoint. So in order that we shall have a sharp line in our spectrum correspondingto a deﬁnite momentum, with an uncertainty given by (38.4), we have to have awave train of at least length L. If the wave train is too short we are not usingthe entire grating. The waves which form the spectrum are being reﬂected fromonly a very short sector of the grating if the wave train is too short, and thegrating will not work right—we will ﬁnd a big angular spread. In order to get anarrower one, we need to use the whole grating, so that at least at some momentthe whole wave train is scattering simultaneously from all parts of the grating.

38-6

Thus the wave train must be of length L in order to have an uncertainty in thewavelength less than that given by (38.5). Incidentally,

Therefore

∆λ/λ2 = ∆(1/λ) = ∆k/2π.

∆k = 2π/L.

(38.6)

(38.7)

where L is the length of the wave train.

This means that if we have a wave train whose length is less than L, theuncertainty in the wave number must exceed 2π/L. Or the uncertainty in a wavenumber times the length of the wave train—we will call that for a moment ∆x—exceeds 2π. We call it ∆x because that is the uncertainty in the location of theparticle. If the wave train exists only in a ﬁnite length, then that is where wecould ﬁnd the particle, within an uncertainty ∆x. Now this property of waves,that the length of the wave train times the uncertainty of the wave numberassociated with it is at least π, is a property that is known to everyone whostudies them. It has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. It is simply that ifwe have a ﬁnite train, we cannot count the waves in it very precisely. Let us tryanother way to see the reason for that.

Suppose that we have a ﬁnite train of length L; then because of the way ithas to decrease at the ends, as in Fig. 38-1, the number of waves in the length Lis uncertain by something like ±1. But the number of waves in L is kL/2π. Thusk is uncertain, and we again get the result (38.7), a property merely of waves.The same thing works whether the waves are in space and k is the number ofradians per centimeter and L is the length of the train, or the waves are in timeand ω is the number of oscillations per second and T is the「length」in timethat the wave train comes in. That is, if we have a wave train lasting only for acertain ﬁnite time T, then the uncertainty in the frequency is given by

∆ω = 2π/T.

(38.8)

We have tried to emphasize that these are properties of waves alone, and theyare well known, for example, in the theory of sound.

The point is that in quantum mechanics we interpret the wave number asbeing a measure of the momentum of a particle, with the rule that p = k, sothat relation (38.7) tells us that ∆p ≈ h/∆x. This, then, is a limitation of theclassical idea of momentum. (Naturally, it has to be limited in some ways if we

38-7

are going to represent particles by waves!) It is nice that we have found a rulethat gives us some idea of when there is a failure of classical ideas.

38-3 Crystal diﬀractionNext let us consider the reﬂection of particle waves from a crystal. A crystalis a thick thing which has a whole lot of similar atoms—we will include somecomplications later—in a nice array. The question is how to set the array so thatwe get a strong reﬂected maximum in a given direction for a given beam of, say,light (x-rays), electrons, neutrons, or anything else. In order to obtain a strongreﬂection, the scattering from all of the atoms must be in phase. There cannotbe equal numbers in phase and out of phase, or the waves will cancel out. Theway to arrange things is to ﬁnd the regions of constant phase, as we have alreadyexplained; they are planes which make equal angles with the initial and ﬁnaldirections (Fig. 38-4).

Fig. 38-4. Scattering of waves by crystal planes.

If we consider two parallel planes, as in Fig. 38-4, the waves scattered fromthe two planes will be in phase provided the diﬀerence in distance travelled by awavefront is an integral number of wavelengths. This diﬀerence can be seen tobe 2d sin θ, where d is the perpendicular distance between the planes. Thus thecondition for coherent reﬂection is

2d sin θ = nλ

(n = 1, 2, . . . ).

(38.9)

38-8

If, for example, the crystal is such that the atoms happen to lie on planesobeying condition (38.9) with n = 1, then there will be a strong reﬂection. If,on the other hand, there are other atoms of the same nature (equal in density)halfway between, then the intermediate planes will also scatter equally stronglyand will interfere with the others and produce no eﬀect. So d in (38.9) must referto adjacent planes; we cannot take a plane ﬁve layers farther back and use thisformula!As a matter of interest, actual crystals are not usually as simple as a singlekind of atom repeated in a certain way. Instead; if we make a two-dimensionalanalog, they are much like wallpaper, in which there is some kind of ﬁgurewhich repeats all over the wallpaper. By「ﬁgure」we mean, in the case of atoms,some arrangement—calcium and a carbon and three oxygens, etc., for calciumcarbonate, and so on—which may involve a relatively large number of atoms.But whatever it is, the ﬁgure is repeated in a pattern. This basic ﬁgure is calleda unit cell.The basic pattern of repetition deﬁnes what we call the lattice type; the latticetype can be immediately determined by looking at the reﬂections and seeingwhat their symmetry is. In other words, where we ﬁnd any reﬂections at alldetermines the lattice type, but in order to determine what is in each of theelements of the lattice one must take into account the intensity of the scatteringat the various directions. Which directions scatter depends on the type of lattice,but how strongly each scatters is determined by what is inside each unit cell, andin that way the structure of crystals is worked out.Two photographs of x-ray diﬀraction patterns are shown in Figs. 38-5 and 38-6;

they illustrate scattering from rock salt and myoglobin, respectively.

Figure 38-5

Figure 38-6

38-9

Incidentally, an interesting thing happens if the spacings of the nearest planesare less than λ/2. In this case (38.9) has no solution for n. Thus if λ is biggerthan twice the distance between adjacent planes then there is no side diﬀractionpattern, and the light—or whatever it is—will go right through the materialwithout bouncing oﬀ or getting lost. So in the case of light, where λ is muchbigger than the spacing, of course it does go through and there is no pattern ofreﬂection from the planes of the crystal.

Fig. 38-7. Diﬀusion of pile neutrons through graphite block.

This fact also has an interesting consequence in the case of piles which makeneutrons (these are obviously particles, for anybody’s money!). If we take theseneutrons and let them into a long block of graphite, the neutrons diﬀuse andwork their way along (Fig. 38-7). They diﬀuse because they are bounced by theatoms, but strictly, in the wave theory, they are bounced by the atoms because ofdiﬀraction from the crystal planes. It turns out that if we take a very long pieceof graphite, the neutrons that come out the far end are all of long wavelength! Infact, if one plots the intensity as a function of wavelength, we get nothing except

Fig. 38-8. Intensity of neutrons out of graphite rod as function of

wavelength.

38-10

for wavelengths longer than a certain minimum (Fig. 38-8). In other words, wecan get very slow neutrons that way. Only the slowest neutrons come through;they are not diﬀracted or scattered by the crystal planes of the graphite, butkeep going right through like light through glass, and are not scattered out thesides. There are many other demonstrations of the reality of neutron waves andwaves of other particles.

38-4 The size of an atomWe now consider another application of the uncertainty relation, Eq. (38.3).It must not be taken too seriously; the idea is right but the analysis is not veryaccurate. The idea has to do with the determination of the size of atoms, andthe fact that, classically, the electrons would radiate light and spiral in untilthey settle down right on top of the nucleus. But that cannot be right quantum-mechanically because then we would know where each electron was and how fastit was moving.

Suppose we have a hydrogen atom, and measure the position of the electron; wemust not be able to predict exactly where the electron will be, or the momentumspread will then turn out to be inﬁnite. Every time we look at the electron,it is somewhere, but it has an amplitude to be in diﬀerent places so there is aprobability of it being found in diﬀerent places. These places cannot all be at thenucleus; we shall suppose there is a spread in position of order a. That is, thedistance of the electron from the nucleus is usually about a. We shall determinea by minimizing the total energy of the atom.The spread in momentum is roughly /a because of the uncertainty relation,so that if we try to measure the momentum of the electron in some manner,such as by scattering x-rays oﬀ it and looking for the Doppler eﬀect from amoving scatterer, we would expect not to get zero every time—the electron isnot standing still—but the momenta must be of the order p ≈ /a. Then thekinetic energy is roughly 12 mv2 = p2/2m = 2/2ma2. (In a sense, this is a kindof dimensional analysis to ﬁnd out in what way the kinetic energy depends uponthe reduced Planck constant, upon m, and upon the size of the atom. We neednot trust our answer to within factors like 2, π, etc. We have not even deﬁned avery precisely.) Now the potential energy is minus e2 over the distance from thecenter, say −e2/a, where, we remember, e2 is the charge of an electron squared,divided by 4π0. Now the point is that the potential energy is reduced if a getssmaller, but the smaller a is, the higher the momentum required, because of

38-11

the uncertainty principle, and therefore the higher the kinetic energy. The totalenergy is

E = 2/2ma2 − e2/a.

(38.10)We do not know what a is, but we know that the atom is going to arrange itselfto make some kind of compromise so that the energy is as little as possible. Inorder to minimize E, we diﬀerentiate with respect to a, set the derivative equalto zero, and solve for a. The derivative of E is

dE/da = −2/ma3 + e2/a2,

and setting dE/da = 0 gives for a the value

a0 = 2/me2 = 0.528 angstrom,

= 0.528 × 10−10 meter.

(38.11)

(38.12)

out

This particular distance is called the Bohr radius, and we have thus learnedthat atomic dimensions are of the order of angstroms, which is right: This ispretty good—in fact, it is amazing, since until now we have had no basis forunderstanding the size of atoms! Atoms are completely impossible from theclassical point of view, since the electrons would spiral into the nucleus.

E0 = −e2/2a0 = −me4/22 = −13.6 eV.

Now if we put the value (38.12) for a0 into (38.10) to ﬁnd the energy, it comes(38.13)What does a negative energy mean? It means that the electron has less energywhen it is in the atom than when it is free. It means it is bound. It means it takesenergy to kick the electron out; it takes energy of the order of 13.6 eV to ionizea hydrogen atom. We have no reason to think that it is not two or three timesthis—or half of this—or (1/π) times this, because we have used such a sloppyargument. However, we have cheated, we have used all the constants in such away that it happens to come out the right number! This number, 13.6 electronvolts, is called a Rydberg of energy; it is the ionization energy of hydrogen.

So we now understand why we do not fall through the ﬂoor. As we walk, ourshoes with their masses of atoms push against the ﬂoor with its mass of atoms.In order to squash the atoms closer together, the electrons would be conﬁned toa smaller space and, by the uncertainty principle, their momenta would have tobe higher on the average, and that means high energy; the resistance to atomic

38-12

compression is a quantum-mechanical eﬀect and not a classical eﬀect. Classically,we would expect that if we were to draw all the electrons and protons closertogether, the energy would be reduced still further, and the best arrangement ofpositive and negative charges in classical physics is all on top of each other. Thiswas well known in classical physics and was a puzzle because of the existence of theatom. Of course, the early scientists invented some ways out of the trouble—butnever mind, we have the right way out, now! (Maybe.)

Incidentally, although we have no reason to understand it at the moment, ina situation where there are many electrons it turns out that they try to keepaway from each other. If one electron is occupying a certain space, then anotherdoes not occupy the same space. More precisely, there are two spin cases, so thattwo can sit on top of each other, one spinning one way and one the other way.But after that we cannot put any more there. We have to put others in anotherplace, and that is the real reason that matter has strength. If we could put allthe electrons in the same place it would condense even more than it does. It isthe fact that the electrons cannot all get on top of each other that makes tablesand everything else solid.

Obviously, in order to understand the properties of matter, we will have to

use quantum mechanics and not be satisﬁed with classical mechanics.

38-5 Energy levelsWe have talked about the atom in its lowest possible energy condition, butit turns out that the electron can do other things. It can jiggle and wiggle in amore energetic manner, and so there are many diﬀerent possible motions for theatom. According to quantum mechanics, in a stationary condition there can onlybe deﬁnite energies for an atom. We make a diagram (Fig. 38-9) in which we

Fig. 38-9. Energy diagram for an atom, showing several possible

transitions.

38-13

plot the energy vertically, and we make a horizontal line for each allowed value ofthe energy. When the electron is free, i.e., when its energy is positive, it can haveany energy; it can be moving at any speed. But bound energies are not arbitrary.The atom must have one or another out of a set of allowed values, such as thosein Fig. 38-9.

Now let us call the allowed values of the energy E0, E1, E2, E3. If an atomis initially in one of these「excited states,」E1, E2, etc., it does not remain inthat state forever. Sooner or later it drops to a lower state and radiates energyin the form of light. The frequency of the light that is emitted is determinedby conservation of energy plus the quantum-mechanical understanding that thefrequency of the light is related to the energy of the light by (38.1). Thereforethe frequency of the light which is liberated in a transition from energy E3 toenergy E1 (for example) is

ω31 = (E3 − E1)/.

(38.14)This, then, is a characteristic frequency of the atom and deﬁnes a spectral emissionline. Another possible transition would be from E3 to E0. That would have adiﬀerent frequency(38.15)Another possibility is that if the atom were excited to the state E1 it could dropto the ground state E0, emitting a photon of frequency

ω30 = (E3 − E0)/.

(38.16)The reason we bring up three transitions is to point out an interesting relationship.It is easy to see from (38.14), (38.15), and (38.16) that

ω10 = (E1 − E0)/.

ω30 = ω31 + ω10.

(38.17)In general, if we ﬁnd two spectral lines, we shall expect to ﬁnd another line at thesum of the frequencies (or the diﬀerence in the frequencies), and that all the linescan be understood by ﬁnding a series of levels such that every line correspondsto the diﬀerence in energy of some pair of levels. This remarkable coincidence inspectral frequencies was noted before quantum mechanics was discovered, and itis called the Ritz combination principle. This is again a mystery from the point ofview of classical mechanics. Let us not belabor the point that classical mechanicsis a failure in the atomic domain; we seem to have demonstrated that pretty well.

38-14

We have already talked about quantum mechanics as being represented byamplitudes which behave like waves, with certain frequencies and wave numbers.Let us observe how it comes about from the point of view of amplitudes that theatom has deﬁnite energy states. This is something we cannot understand fromwhat has been said so far, but we are all familiar with the fact that conﬁnedwaves have deﬁnite frequencies. For instance, if sound is conﬁned to an organpipe, or anything like that, then there is more than one way that the sound canvibrate, but for each such way there is a deﬁnite frequency. Thus an object inwhich the waves are conﬁned has certain resonance frequencies. It is therefore aproperty of waves in a conﬁned space—a subject which we will discuss in detailwith formulas later on—that they exist only at deﬁnite frequencies. And since thegeneral relation exists between frequencies of the amplitude and energy, we arenot surprised to ﬁnd deﬁnite energies associated with electrons bound in atoms.

38-6 Philosophical implicationsLet us consider brieﬂy some philosophical implications of quantum mechanics.As always, there are two aspects of the problem: one is the philosophical implica-tion for physics, and the other is the extrapolation of philosophical matters toother ﬁelds. When philosophical ideas associated with science are dragged intoanother ﬁeld, they are usually completely distorted. Therefore we shall conﬁneour remarks as much as possible to physics itself.

First of all, the most interesting aspect is the idea of the uncertainty principle;making an observation aﬀects the phenomenon.It has always been knownthat making observations aﬀects a phenomenon, but the point is that the eﬀectcannot be disregarded or minimized or decreased arbitrarily by rearranging theapparatus. When we look for a certain phenomenon we cannot help but disturbit in a certain minimum way, and the disturbance is necessary for the consistencyof the viewpoint. The observer was sometimes important in prequantum physics,but only in a rather trivial sense. The problem has been raised: if a tree falls ina forest and there is nobody there to hear it, does it make a noise? A real treefalling in a real forest makes a sound, of course, even if nobody is there. Even ifno one is present to hear it, there are other traces left. The sound will shake someleaves, and if we were careful enough we might ﬁnd somewhere that some thornhad rubbed against a leaf and made a tiny scratch that could not be explainedunless we assumed the leaf were vibrating. So in a certain sense we would haveto admit that there is a sound made. We might ask: was there a sensation of

38-15

sound? No, sensations have to do, presumably, with consciousness. And whetherants are conscious and whether there were ants in the forest, or whether the treewas conscious, we do not know. Let us leave the problem in that form.

Another thing that people have emphasized since quantum mechanics wasdeveloped is the idea that we should not speak about those things which wecannot measure. (Actually relativity theory also said this.) Unless a thing can bedeﬁned by measurement, it has no place in a theory. And since an accurate valueof the momentum of a localized particle cannot be deﬁned by measurement ittherefore has no place in the theory. The idea that this is what was the matterwith classical theory is a false position. It is a careless analysis of the situation.Just because we cannot measure position and momentum precisely does not apriori mean that we cannot talk about them. It only means that we need not talkabout them. The situation in the sciences is this: A concept or an idea whichcannot be measured or cannot be referred directly to experiment may or may notbe useful. It need not exist in a theory. In other words, suppose we compare theclassical theory of the world with the quantum theory of the world, and supposethat it is true experimentally that we can measure position and momentum onlyimprecisely. The question is whether the ideas of the exact position of a particleand the exact momentum of a particle are valid or not. The classical theoryadmits the ideas; the quantum theory does not. This does not in itself mean thatclassical physics is wrong. When the new quantum mechanics was discovered,the classical people—which included everybody except Heisenberg, Schrödinger,and Born—said:「Look, your theory is not any good because you cannot answercertain questions like: what is the exact position of a particle?, which hole doesit go through?, and some others.」Heisenberg’s answer was:「I do not need toanswer such questions because you cannot ask such a question experimentally.」Itis that we do not have to. Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains an ideathat cannot be checked directly but which is used in the analysis, and the other,(b), does not contain the idea. If they disagree in their predictions, one could notclaim that (b) is false because it cannot explain this idea that is in (a), becausethat idea is one of the things that cannot be checked directly. It is always goodto know which ideas cannot be checked directly, but it is not necessary to removethem all. It is not true that we can pursue science completely by using only thoseconcepts which are directly subject to experiment.

In quantum mechanics itself there is a wave function amplitude, there is apotential, and there are many constructs that we cannot measure directly. Thebasis of a science is its ability to predict. To predict means to tell what will

happen in an experiment that has never been done. How can we do that? Byassuming that we know what is there, independent of the experiment. We mustextrapolate the experiments to a region where they have not been done. Wemust take our concepts and extend them to places where they have not yetbeen checked. If we do not do that, we have no prediction. So it was perfectlysensible for the classical physicists to go happily along and suppose that theposition—which obviously means something for a baseball—meant somethingalso for an electron. It was not stupidity. It was a sensible procedure. Today wesay that the law of relativity is supposed to be true at all energies, but somedaysomebody may come along and say how stupid we were. We do not know wherewe are「stupid」until we「stick our neck out,」and so the whole idea is to put ourneck out. And the only way to ﬁnd out that we are wrong is to ﬁnd out whatour predictions are. It is absolutely necessary to make constructs.We have already made a few remarks about the indeterminacy of quantummechanics. That is, that we are unable now to predict what will happen inphysics in a given physical circumstance which is arranged as carefully as possible.If we have an atom that is in an excited state and so is going to emit a photon,we cannot say when it will emit the photon. It has a certain amplitude to emitthe photon at any time, and we can predict only a probability for emission; wecannot predict the future exactly. This has given rise to all kinds of nonsenseand questions on the meaning of freedom of will, and of the idea that the worldis uncertain.

Of course we must emphasize that classical physics is also indeterminate, in asense. It is usually thought that this indeterminacy, that we cannot predict thefuture, is an important quantum-mechanical thing, and this is said to explain thebehavior of the mind, feelings of free will, etc. But if the world were classical—ifthe laws of mechanics were classical—it is not quite obvious that the mind wouldnot feel more or less the same. It is true classically that if we knew the positionand the velocity of every particle in the world, or in a box of gas, we could predictexactly what would happen. And therefore the classical world is deterministic.Suppose, however, that we have a ﬁnite accuracy and do not know exactly wherejust one atom is, say to one part in a billion. Then as it goes along it hits anotheratom, and because we did not know the position better than to one part in abillion, we ﬁnd an even larger error in the position after the collision. And thatis ampliﬁed, of course, in the next collision, so that if we start with only a tinyerror it rapidly magniﬁes to a very great uncertainty. To give an example: ifwater falls over a dam, it splashes. If we stand nearby, every now and then a

drop will land on our nose. This appears to be completely random, yet such abehavior would be predicted by purely classical laws. The exact position of allthe drops depends upon the precise wigglings of the water before it goes overthe dam. How? The tiniest irregularities are magniﬁed in falling, so that we getcomplete randomness. Obviously, we cannot really predict the position of thedrops unless we know the motion of the water absolutely exactly.Speaking more precisely, given an arbitrary accuracy, no matter how precise,one can ﬁnd a time long enough that we cannot make predictions valid for thatlong a time. Now the point is that this length of time is not very large. It is notthat the time is millions of years if the accuracy is one part in a billion. Thetime goes, in fact, only logarithmically with the error, and it turns out that inonly a very, very tiny time we lose all our information. If the accuracy is takento be one part in billions and billions and billions—no matter how many billionswe wish, provided we do stop somewhere—then we can ﬁnd a time less than thetime it took to state the accuracy—after which we can no longer predict what isgoing to happen! It is therefore not fair to say that from the apparent freedomand indeterminacy of the human mind, we should have realized that classical「deterministic」physics could not ever hope to understand it, and to welcomequantum mechanics as a release from a「completely mechanistic」universe. Foralready in classical mechanics there was indeterminability from a practical pointof view.
