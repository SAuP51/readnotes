# 0201. Basic Physics

## 2.1 Introduction 

In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time.

The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations.

For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we also understand the sand and the moon? Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do diﬀerent movements have? What is common to diﬀerent kinds of sound? How many diﬀerent colors are there? And so on. In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at ﬁrst sight look diﬀerent, with the hope that we may be able to reduce the number of diﬀerent things and thereby understand them better.

A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers to such questions. Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call the scientiﬁc method. We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is sometimes called fundamental physics, or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method. What do we mean by「understanding」something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes「the world」is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to ﬁnd all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we「understand」the world.

How can we tell whether the rules which we「guess」at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we can ﬁgure out exactly.) A second good way to check rules is in terms of less speciﬁc rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by ﬁnding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we ﬁnd that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an over-all way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules. The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game. At ﬁrst the phenomena of nature were roughly divided into classes, like heat, electricity, mechanics, magnetism, properties of substances, chemical phenomena, light or optics, x-rays, nuclear physics, gravitation, meson phenomena, etc. However, the aim is to see complete nature as diﬀerent aspects of one set of phenomena. That is the problem in basic theoretical physics, today—to ﬁnd the laws behind experiment; to amalgamate these classes. Historically, we have always been able to amalgamate them, but as time goes on new things are found. We were amalgamating very well, when all of a sudden x-rays were found. Then we amalgamated some more, and mesons were found. Therefore, at any stage of the game, it always looks rather messy. A great deal is amalgamated, but there are always many wires or threads hanging out in all directions. That is the situation today, which we shall try to describe.

Some historic examples of amalgamation are the following. First, take heat and mechanics. When atoms are in motion, the more motion, the more heat the system contains, and so heat and all temperature eﬀects can be represented by the laws of mechanics. Another tremendous amalgamation was the discovery of the relation between electricity, magnetism, and light, which were found to be diﬀerent aspects of the same thing, which we call today the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Another amalgamation is the uniﬁcation of chemical phenomena, the various properties of various substances, and the behavior of atomic particles, which is in the quantum mechanics of chemistry. The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalgamate everything, and merely discover that this world represents diﬀerent aspects of one thing?

Nobody knows. All we know is that as we go along, we ﬁnd that we can amalga- mate pieces, and then we ﬁnd some pieces that do not ﬁt, and we keep trying to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Whether there are a ﬁnite number of pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, is of course unknown. It will never be known until we ﬁnish the picture, if ever. What we wish to do here is to see to what extent this amalgamation process has gone on, and what the situation is at present, in understanding basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set of principles. To express it in a simple manner, what are things made of and how few elements are there?

2-1 引言

在本章中我们将考察有关物理学的最基本观念，即我们在目前所知道的事物的本性。这里将不去论及我们如何知道所有这些观念是正确的那个认识过程，你们在适当的时候会学习到这些具体的细节。

我们在科学上所关心的事物具有无数的形式和许多属性。举例来说，假如我们站在岸边眺望大海，将会看到：这里有海水、拍击的浪花、飞溅的泡沫以及汹涌的波浪，还有太阳、光线、蔚蓝的天空、白云以及空气的流动一一风；在海边有沙粒，不同色纹和硬度的岩石；在海里浮游着生物，此生彼灭；最后，还有我们这些站在海岸边的观察者；甚至还有幸福和怀念。在自然界的其他场合，也同样出现种种纷繁复杂的事物和影响。无论在哪里，到处都是这样错综复杂和变化无穷。好奇心驱使我们提出问题，把事物联系起来，而将它们的种种表现理解为或许是由较少量的基本事物和相互作用以无穷多的方式组合后所产生的结果。

例如，沙粒和岩石是两回事吗？也许沙粒只不过是大量的细小石块？月亮是不是一块巨大的岩石呢？如果我们了解岩石，是否就能了解沙粒和月亮呢？风是否与海洋中的水流相类似，就是一种空气的流动？不同的运动有什么共同特征？不同的声音有什么相似之处？究竟有多少种颜色？等等。我们就是试图这样逐步分析所有的事情，把那些乍看起来似乎不相同的东西联系起来，希望有可能减少不同类事物的数目，从而能更好地理解它们。

几百年以前，人们想出了一种部分解答这类问题的方法，那就是：观察、推理和实验，这些内容构成了通常所说的科学方法。在这里，我们将只限于对那些有时称为基础物理中的基本观点，或者在科学方法的应用中形成的基本概念作一描述。

现在我们要问：所谓「理解」某种事情指的是什么意思？可以作一想象：组成这个「世界」的运动物体的复杂排列似乎有点像是天神们所下的一盘伟大的国际象棋，我们则是这盘棋的观众。我们不知道弈棋的规则，所有能做的事就是观看这场棋赛。当然，假如我们观看了足够长的时间，总归能看出几条规则来。这些弈棋规则就是我们所说的基础物理。但是，即使我们知道了每条规则，仍然可能不理解为什么下棋时要走某一步棋，这仅仅是因为情况太复杂了，而我们的智力却是有限的。如果你们会下棋，就一定知道，学会所有的规则是容易的，但要选择最好的一着棋，或者要弄懂别人为什么走这一着棋往往就很困难了。在自然界里，情况也正是如此，而且只会更难一些。但是，至少我们能发现所有的规则。实际上我们今天还没有找到所有规则（时而还会出现弈棋中「王车易位」之类的令人费解的情况）。除了我们还不知道所有的规则以外，我们真正能用已知规则来解释的事情也是非常有限的，因为几乎所有的情况都是极其复杂的，我们不能领会这盘棋中应用这些规则的走法，更无法预言下一步将要怎样。所以，我们必须使自己只限于这种游戏规则的比较基本的问题。如果我们知道了这些规则，就认为「理解」了世界。

如果我们不能很好地分析这盘象棋游戏，那么又怎样来辨别我们「猜测」出的规则实际上是否正确呢？大致地讲，可以有三种办法。第一，可能有这种情况：大自然安排得，或者说我们将大自然安排得十分简单，只有少数几个组成部分，从而使我们能够正确地预测将要发生的事。在这种情况下，我们就能检验我们的规则是怎样起作用的（在棋盘角落里可能只有少数几个棋子在移动，所以我们能够正确地解决）。

第二种检验规则的好办法是，利用那些由已知规则推导出来的较一般性的法则来检验已知规则本身。比如，象在棋盘中移动的规则是只许走对角线，因而我们可以推断，无论象走了多少步，它总是出现在红方块里。这样，即使不能领会细节，我们也总能检验有关象的走法的概念，只要弄清楚它是否一直在红方块里。当然，在相当长的时间里，它都将如此，直到突然发现它出现在黑方块里（显然，这时发生的情况是这个象被俘获了，另一个卒走过来成为皇后，红方块的象就变成黑方块的象）。这也就是物理学中出现的情况，即使我们不能领会其中的细节，但是在相当长的时期内我们仍有在各方面都很好地起作用的规则；但是在某个时候，我们又会发现新的规则。从基本物理的观点来看，最有趣的现象当然是在那些新的场合一一那些已知规则行不通的场合中所出现的现象，而不是在原有规则行得通的地方发生的现象！这是我们发现新规则的一条途径。

第三种鉴别我们的观念是否正确的方法比较粗糙，但或许是所有方法中最为有效的，这就是用粗略的近似方法来加以辨别。我们可能说不出为什么阿莱克因（Alekhine）要走这步棋，但是我们或许能大致认为他或多或少地在调集一些棋子到王的周围来保护它。因为这是在这种情况下明摆着的事。同样，根据我们对这盘棋的理解，即使不能看出每一步棋的作用，也常常能对自然界多少有所理解。

人们首先把自然界中的现象大致分为几类，如热、电、力学、磁、物性、化学、光或光学、X 射线、核物理、引力、介子等等现象。然而，这样做的目的是将整个自然界看作是一系列现象的许多不同侧面。这就是今天基础理论物理面临的问题：发现隐匿在实验后的定律；把各类现象综合起来。在历史上，人们总能做到这一点，但随着时间的推移，新的事实发现了；我们曾经将现象综合得很好，突然，发现了射线，随后我们又融合了更多事实，但是又发现了介子。因此，在弈棋的任何一个阶段，看起来总是相当凌乱。大量事实被归并了，但总还有许多线索向一切方向延伸出去。这就是今天的状况，也就是我们将试图去描绘的现状

历史上出现过的若干进行综合的情况有如下几个。首先，是热与力学的综合。当原子运动时，运动得越是剧烈，系统所包含的热量就越多，因此，热和所有的温度效应可以用力学定律来说明。另一个巨大的综合是发现了电、磁、光之间的联系，从而知道它们是同一个事物的不同方面，即今天我们称为电磁场的那个东西的不同表现。还有一个综合是把化学现象、各种物质的各种性质以及原子的行为统一起来，这就是量子化学的内容。

显然，现在的问题是：能不能继续把所有事情都综合起来，并且发现整个世界只是体现

了件事情的种种不同方面？无人知道答案如何。我们所知道的只是：这样做下去时，我们发现可以综合一些事实，随后又发党出现了一些不能综合的事实。我们继续尝试这种拼图游戏。至于是否只有有限数量的棋子，甚至这场拼图游戏是否有底，当然不知道。除非有那么一天终于把图拼成了，否则我们就永远不会知道事情的究竟。在这里我们要做的是，看看哪种综合已进行到什么程度，在借助于最少的一组原理来理解基本现象方面，现状又是如何。简言之，事物是用什么构成的？总共存在多少基本元素？

## 2-2 Physics before 1920 

It is a little diﬃcult to begin at once with the present view, so we shall ﬁrst see how things looked in about 1920 and then take a few things out of that picture. Before 1920, our world picture was something like this: The「stage」on which the universe goes is the three-dimensional space of geometry, as described by Euclid, and things change in a medium called time. The elements on the stage are particles, for example the atoms, which have some properties. First, the property of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless forces act upon it. The second element, then, is forces, which were then thought to be of two varieties: First, an enormously complicated, detailed kind of interaction force which held the various atoms in diﬀerent combinations in a complicated way, which determined whether salt would dissolve faster or slower when we raise the temperature. The other force that was known was a long-range interaction—a smooth and quiet attraction—which varied inversely as the square of the distance, and was called gravitation. This law was known and was very simple. Why things remain in motion when they are moving, or why there is a law of gravitation was, of course, not known.

A description of nature is what we are concerned with here. From this point of view, then, a gas, and indeed all matter, is a myriad of moving particles. Thus many of the things we saw while standing at the seashore can immediately be connected. First the pressure: this comes from the collisions of the atoms with the walls or whatever; the drift of the atoms, if they are all moving in one direction on the average, is wind; the random internal motions are the heat. There are waves of excess density, where too many particles have collected, and so as they rush oﬀ they push up piles of particles farther out, and so on. This wave of excess density is sound. It is a tremendous achievement to be able to understand so much. Some of these things were described in the previous chapter. What kinds of particles are there? There were considered to be 92 at that time: 92 diﬀerent kinds of atoms were ultimately discovered. They had diﬀerent names associated with their chemical properties.

The next part of the problem was, what are the short-range forces? Why does carbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but not three oxygens? What is the machinery of interaction between atoms? Is it gravitation? The answer is no. Gravity is entirely too weak. But imagine a force analogous to gravity, varying inversely with the square of the distance, but enormously more powerful and having one diﬀerence. In gravity everything attracts everything else, but now imagine that there are two kinds of「things,」and that this new force (which is the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes repel but unlikes attract. The「thing」that carries this strong interaction is called charge. Then what do we have? Suppose that we have two unlikes that attract each other, a plus and a minus, and that they stick very close together. Suppose we have another charge some distance away. Would it feel any attraction? It would feel practically none, because if the ﬁrst two are equal in size, the attraction for the one and the repulsion for the other balance out. Therefore there is very little force at any appreciable distance. On the other hand, if we get very close with the extra charge, attraction arises, because the repulsion of likes and attraction of unlikes will tend to bring unlikes closer together and push likes farther apart. Then the repulsion will be less than the attraction. This is the reason why the atoms, which are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel very little force when they are separated by appreciable distance (aside from gravity). When they come close together, they can「see inside」each other and rearrange their charges, with the result that they have a very strong interaction. The ultimate basis of an interaction between the atoms is electrical. Since this force is so enormous, all the plusses and all minuses will normally come together in as intimate a combination as they can. All things, even ourselves, are made of ﬁne-grained, enormously strongly interacting plus and minus parts, all neatly balanced out. Once in a while, by accident, we may rub oﬀ a few minuses or a few plusses (usually it is easier to rub oﬀ minuses), and in those circumstances we ﬁnd the force of electricity unbalanced, and we can then see the eﬀects of these electrical attractions. To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravitation, consider two grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart. If the force between them were not balanced, if everything attracted everything else instead of likes repelling, so that there were no cancellation, how much force would there be? There would be a force of three million tons between the two! You see, there is very, very little excess or deﬁcit of the number of negative or positive charges necessary to produce appreciable electrical eﬀects. This is, of course, the reason why you cannot see the diﬀerence between an electrically charged or uncharged thing—so few particles are involved that they hardly make a diﬀerence in the weight or size of an object.

With this picture the atoms were easier to understand. They were thought to have a「nucleus」at the center, which is positively electrically charged and very massive, and the nucleus is surrounded by a certain number of「electrons」which are very light and negatively charged. Now we go a little ahead in our story to remark that in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons, almost of the same weight and very heavy. The protons are electrically charged and the neutrons are neutral. If we have an atom with six protons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded by six electrons (the negative particles in the ordinary world of matter are all electrons, and these are very light compared with the protons and neutrons which make nuclei), this would be atom number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon. Atom number eight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend upon the electrons on the outside, and in fact only upon how many electrons there are. So the chemical properties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons. (The whole list of elements of the chemists really could have been called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Instead of saying「carbon,」we could say「element six,」meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements were ﬁrst discovered, it was not known that they could be numbered that way, and secondly, it would make everything look rather complicated. It is better to have names and symbols for these things, rather than to call everything by number.)

More was discovered about the electrical force. The natural interpretation of electrical interaction is that two objects simply attract each other: plus against minus. However, this was discovered to be an inadequate idea to represent it. A more adequate representation of the situation is to say that the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a「condition」in space, so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This potentiality for producing a force is called an electric ﬁeld. When we put an electron in an electric ﬁeld, we say it is「pulled.」We then have two rules: (a) charges make a ﬁeld, and (b) charges in ﬁelds have forces on them and move. The reason for this will become clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body, say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper at a distance and move the comb back and forth, the paper will respond by always pointing to the comb. If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that the paper is a little behind, there is a delay in the action. (At the ﬁrst stage, when we move the comb rather slowly, we ﬁnd a complication which is magnetism. Magnetic inﬂuences have to do with charges in relative motion, so magnetic forces and electric forces can really be attributed to one ﬁeld, as two diﬀerent aspects of exactly the same thing. A changing electric ﬁeld cannot exist without magnetism.) If we move the charged paper farther out, the delay is greater. Then an interesting thing is observed. Although the forces between two charged objects should go inversely as the square of the distance, it is found, when we shake a charge, that the inﬂuence extends very much farther out than we would guess at ﬁrst sight. That is, the eﬀect falls oﬀ more slowly than the inverse square. Here is an analogy: If we are in a pool of water and there is a ﬂoating cork very close by, we can move it「directly」by pushing the water with another cork. If you looked only at the two corks, all you would see would be that one moved immediately in response to the motion of the other—there is some kind of「interaction」between them. Of course, what we really do is to disturb the water; the water then disturbs the other cork. We could make up a「law」that if you pushed the water a little bit, an object close by in the water would move. If it were farther away, of course, the second cork would scarcely move, for we move the water locally. On the other hand, if we jiggle the cork a new phenomenon is involved, in which the motion of the water moves the water there, etc., and waves travel away, so that by jiggling, there is an inﬂuence very much farther out, an oscillatory inﬂuence, that cannot be understood from the direct interaction. Therefore the idea of direct interaction must be replaced with the existence of the water, or in the electrical case, with what we call the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The electromagnetic ﬁeld can carry waves; some of these waves are light, others are used in radio broadcasts, but the general name is electromagnetic waves. These oscillatory waves can have various frequencies. The only thing that is really diﬀerent from one wave to another is the frequency of oscillation. If we shake a charge back and forth more and more rapidly, and look at the eﬀects, we get a whole series of diﬀerent kinds of eﬀects, which are all uniﬁed by specifying but one number, the number of oscillations per second. The usual「pickup」that we get from electric currents in the circuits in the walls of a building have a frequency of about one hundred cycles per second. If we increase the frequency to

500 or 1000 kilocycles (1 kilocycle = 1000 cycles) per second, we are「on the air,」for this is the frequency range which is used for radio broadcasts. (Of course it has nothing to do with the air! We can have radio broadcasts without any air.) If we again increase the frequency, we come into the range that is used for FM and TV. Going still further, we use certain short waves, for example for radar. Still higher, and we do not need an instrument to「see」the stuﬀ, we can see it with the human eye. In the range of frequency from 5 × 1014 to 1015 cycles per second our eyes would see the oscillation of the charged comb, if we could shake it that fast, as red, blue, or violet light, depending on the frequency. Frequencies below this range are called infrared, and above it, ultraviolet. The fact that we can see in a particular frequency range makes that part of the electromagnetic spectrum no more impressive than the other parts from a physicist’s standpoint, but from a human standpoint, of course, it is more interesting. If we go up even higher in frequency, we get x-rays. X-rays are nothing but very high-frequency light. If we go still higher, we get gamma rays. These two terms, x-rays and gamma rays, are used almost synonymously. Usually electromagnetic rays coming from nuclei are called gamma rays, while those of high energy from atoms are called x-rays, but at the same frequency they are indistinguishable physically, no matter what their source. If we go to still higher frequencies, say to 1024 cycles per second, we ﬁnd that we can make those waves artiﬁcially, for example with the synchrotron here at Caltech. We can ﬁnd electromagnetic waves with stupendously high frequencies—with even a thousand times more rapid oscillation—in the waves found in cosmic rays. These waves cannot be controlled by us.

## 2-3 Quantum physics 

Having described the idea of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and that this ﬁeld can carry waves, we soon learn that these waves actually behave in a strange way which seems very unwavelike. At higher frequencies they behave much more like particles! It is quantum mechanics, discovered just after 1920, which explains this strange behavior. In the years before 1920, the picture of space as a three-dimensional space, and of time as a separate thing, was changed by Einstein, ﬁrst into a combination which we call space-time, and then still further into a curved space-time to represent gravitation. So the「stage」is changed into space-time, and gravitation is presumably a modiﬁcation of space-time. Then it was also found that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect. The mechanical rules of「inertia」and「forces」are wrong—Newton’s laws are wrong—in the world of atoms. Instead, it was discovered that things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale. That is what makes physics diﬃcult—and very interesting. It is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so「unnatural」; we have no direct experience with it. Here things behave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behavior in any other than analytic ways. It is diﬃcult, and takes a lot of imagination. Quantum mechanics has many aspects. In the ﬁrst place, the idea that a particle has a deﬁnite location and a deﬁnite speed is no longer allowed; that is wrong. To give an example of how wrong classical physics is, there is a rule in quantum mechanics that says that one cannot know both where something is and how fast it is moving. The uncertainty of the momentum and the uncertainty of the position are complementary, and the product of the two is bounded by a small constant. We can write the law like this: ∆x ∆p ≥ /2, but we shall explain it in more detail later. This rule is the explanation of a very mysterious paradox: if the atoms are made out of plus and minus charges, why don’t the minus charges simply sit on top of the plus charges (they attract each other) and get so close as to completely cancel them out? Why are atoms so big? Why is the nucleus at the center with the electrons around it? It was ﬁrst thought that this was because the nucleus was so big; but no, the nucleus is very small. An atom has a diameter of about 10−8 cm. The nucleus has a diameter of about 10−13 cm.

If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but very nearly all the weight of the atom is in that inﬁnitesimal nucleus. What keeps the electrons from simply falling in? This principle: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and the uncertainty principle would then require that they have a very large (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large kinetic energy. With this energy they would break away from the nucleus. They make a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance with this rule. (Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute zero, we said that the atoms do not stop moving, they still jiggle. Why? If they stopped moving, we would know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is against the uncertainty principle. We cannot know where they are and how fast they are moving, so they must be continually wiggling in there!)

Another most interesting change in the ideas and philosophy of science brought about by quantum mechanics is this: it is not possible to predict exactly what will happen in any circumstance. For example, it is possible to arrange an atom which is ready to emit light, and we can measure when it has emitted light by picking up a photon particle, which we shall describe shortly. We cannot, however, predict when it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms, which one is going to. You may say that this is because there are some internal「wheels」which we have not looked at closely enough. No, there are no internal wheels; nature, as we understand it today, behaves in such a way that it is fundamentally impossible to make a precise prediction of exactly what will happen in a given experiment. This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply not true, it is not a fundamental condition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can ﬁnd only an average, statistically, as to what happens. Nevertheless, science has not completely collapsed. Philosophers, incidentally, say a great deal about what is absolutely necessary for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong. For example, some philosopher or other said it is fundamental to the scientiﬁc eﬀort that if an experiment is performed in, say, Stockholm, and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the same results must occur. That is quite false. It is not necessary that science do that; it may be a fact of experience, but it is not necessary. For example, if one of the experiments

is to look out at the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see it in Quito; that is a diﬀerent phenomenon.「But,」you say,「that is something that has to do with the outside; can you close yourself up in a box in Stockholm and pull down the shade and get any diﬀerence?」Surely. If we take a pendulum on a universal joint, and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The blinds are down, too. The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science. What is the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the ﬁrst chapter: the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment. If it turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those「most experiments」will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm. We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experiment, and we do not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does not, then it does not. We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience. Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, because these are rather diﬃcult to understand. We shall assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the consequences are. One of the consequences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There is no distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics uniﬁes the idea of the ﬁeld and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the ﬁeld aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate description in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the measurements. In fact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly involving a frequency has yet been detected above approximately 1012 cycles per second. We only deduce the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule which assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid. Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new kind of particle to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron. That new particle is called a photon. The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric ﬁeld and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear processes. For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic ﬁelds, the speciﬁc heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law. All these details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an approximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptions are found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in the nucleus.

In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in chemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynam- ics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things. In the ﬁrst place, it tells the properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a positron, and these two, coming together, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays. (After all, light and gamma rays are all the same, they are just diﬀerent points on a frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true. In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has an- other name—it is called a positron, but for most other particles, it is called anti-so- and-so, like antiproton or antineutron. In quantum electrodynamics, two numbers are put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out. The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron. Actually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads us to the next part.

## 2-4 Nuclei and particles 

What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released,

the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms. The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus? Just as the electrical interaction can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a ﬁeld of some kind, and that when this ﬁeld jiggles it behaves like a particle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides protons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass! But it later turned out to be the wrong particle. It was called a µ-meson, or muon. However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was found, the π-meson, or pion, which satisﬁed Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion. Now, you say,「Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be explained.」Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are involved in this theory are so diﬃcult that no one has ever been able to ﬁgure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty years!

So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a little wrong, or at least incomplete. While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimentalists have been discovering some things. For example, they had already discovered this µ-meson or muon, and we do not yet know where it ﬁts. Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other「extra」particles were found. It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is very diﬃcult to understand the relationships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to another. We do not today understand these various particles as diﬀerent aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a representation of the fact that we have so much unconnected information without a good theory. After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience

and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from. Aside from that, we have made very little progress. We have collected an enormous number of chemical elements. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embodied in the periodic table of Mendeleev. For example, sodium and potassium are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same column in the Mendeleev chart. We have been seeking a Mendeleev-type chart for the new particles. One such chart of the new particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the U.S.A. and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classiﬁcation is a new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each particle, called its「strangeness,」S. This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which take place by nuclear forces. In Table 2-2 are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know. Underneath each particle its mass is given in a certain unit, called the MeV. One MeV is equal to 1.783 × 10−27 gram. The reason this unit was chosen is historical, and we shall not go into it now. More massive particles are put higher up on the chart; we see that a neutron and a proton have almost the same mass. In vertical columns we have put the particles with the same electrical charge, all neutral objects in one column, all positively charged ones to the right of this one, and all negatively charged objects to the left.

Particles are shown with a solid line and「resonances」with a dashed one. Several particles have been omitted from the table. These include the important zero-mass, zero-charge particles, the photon and the graviton, which do not fall into the baryon-meson-lepton classiﬁcation scheme, and also some of the newer resonances (K∗, φ, η). The antiparticles of the mesons are listed in the table, but the antiparticles of the leptons and baryons would have to be listed in another table which would look exactly like this one reﬂected on the zero-charge column. Although all of the particles except the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are unstable, decay products have been shown only for the resonances. Strangeness assignments are not applicable for leptons, since they do not interact strongly with nuclei.

All particles which are together with the neutrons and protons are called baryons, and the following ones exist: There is a「lambda,」with a mass of 1115 MeV, and three others, called sigmas, minus, neutral, and plus, with several masses almost the same. There are groups or multiplets with almost the same

Table 2-2

Elementary Particles

mass, within one or two percent. Each particle in a multiplet has the same strangeness. The ﬁrst multiplet is the proton-neutron doublet, and then there is a singlet (the lambda) then the sigma triplet, and ﬁnally the xi doublet. Very recently, in 1961, even a few more particles were found. Or are they particles? They live so short a time, they disintegrate almost instantaneously, as soon as they are formed, that we do not know whether they should be considered as new particles, or some kind of「resonance」interaction of a certain deﬁnite energy between the Λ and π products into which they disintegrate. In addition to the baryons the other particles which are involved in the nuclear interaction are called mesons. There are ﬁrst the pions, which come in three varieties, positive, negative, and neutral; they form another multiplet. We have also found some new things called K-mesons, and they occur as a doublet, K+ and K0. Also, every particle has its antiparticle, unless a particle is its own antiparticle. For example, the π− and the π+ are antiparticles, but the π0 is its own antiparticle. The K− and K+ are antiparticles, and the K0 and K0. In addition, in 1961 we also found some more mesons or maybe mesons which disintegrate almost immediately. A thing called ω which goes into three pions has a mass 780 on this scale, and somewhat less certain is an object which disintegrates into two pions. These particles, called mesons and baryons, and the antiparticles of the mesons are on the same chart, but the antiparticles of the baryons must be put on another chart,「reﬂected」through the charge-zero column.

Just as Mendeleev’s chart was very good, except for the fact that there were a number of rare earth elements which were hanging out loose from it, so we have a number of things hanging out loose from this chart—particles which do not interact strongly in nuclei, have nothing to do with a nuclear interaction, and do not have a strong interaction (I mean the powerful kind of interaction of nuclear energy). These are called leptons, and they are the following: there is the electron, which has a very small mass on this scale, only 0.510 MeV. Then there is that other, the µ-meson, the muon, which has a mass much higher, 206 times as heavy as an electron. So far as we can tell, by all experiments so far, the diﬀerence between the electron and the muon is nothing but the mass. Everything works exactly the same for the muon as for the electron, except that one is heavier than the other. Why is there another one heavier; what is the use for it? We do not know. In addition, there is a lepton which is neutral, called a neutrino, and this particle has zero mass. In fact, it is now known that there are two diﬀerent kinds of neutrinos, one related to electrons and the other related to muons.

Finally, we have two other particles which do not interact strongly with the nuclear ones: one is a photon, and perhaps, if the ﬁeld of gravity also has a quantum-mechanical analog (a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet been worked out), then there will be a particle, a graviton, which will have zero mass. What is this「zero mass」? The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest. A photon is never at rest, it is always moving at 186,000 miles a second. We will understand more what mass means when we understand the theory of relativity, which will come in due time.

Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together seem to be the fundamental constituents of matter. Fortunately, these particles are not all diﬀerent in their interactions with one another. In fact, there seem to be just four kinds of interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasing strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction, and gravity. The photon is coupled to all charged particles and the strength of the interaction is measured by some number, which is 1/137. The detailed law of this coupling is known, that is quantum electrodynamics. Gravity is coupled to all energy, but its coupling is extremely weak, much weaker than that of electricity. This law is also known. Then there are the so-called weak decays—beta decay, which causes the neutron to disintegrate into proton, electron, and neutrino, relatively slowly. This law is only partly known. The so-called strong interaction, the meson-baryon interaction, has a strength of 1 in this scale, and the law is completely unknown, although there are a number of known rules, such as that the number of baryons does not change in any reaction.

This then, is the horrible condition of our physics today. To summarize it, I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to know all; inside it, quantum mechanics is valid—the principles of quantum mechanics have not been found to fail. The stage on which we put all of our knowledge, we would say, is relativistic space-time; perhaps gravity is involved in space-time. We do not know how the universe got started, and we have never made experiments which check our ideas of space and time accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only know that our ideas work above that distance. We should also add that the rules of the game are the quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply, so far as we can tell, to the new particles as well as to the old. The origin of the forces in nuclei leads us to new particles, but unfortunately they appear in great profusion and we lack a complete understanding of their interrelationship, although we already know that there are some very surprising relationships among them. We seem gradually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of subatomic particles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go in this task.







82-21920 年以前的物理学

开始就从现在的观点讲起是有点困难的，所以让我们先来看一下在 1920 年左右人们是怎样看待世界的，然后再从这幅图像中挑出几件事情来。在 1920 年以前，我们的世界图

像大致是这样的：宇宙活动的「舞台」是欧几里得所描绘的三维几何空间，一切事物在被称为时的一种介质里变化，舞台上的基本元素是粒子，例如原子，它们具有某些恃性。首先它具有惯性：如果一个粒子正在运动，它将沿着同一方向继续运动下去，除非有力作用其上。此外，第二个基本元素就是力，当时认为共有两类力。第一类力是一种极其复杂细致的相互作用，它们以复杂的方式将各种各样的原子约東在不同的组合之中，它们决定当温度升高时食盐是溶解得快些还是慢些；另一类已知的力是一种长程的相互作用，它是与距离平方成反比而变化的平缓的吸引力，称为万有引力。这条定律已为我们所知，它是很简单的。当然，为仕么物体的运动一经开始就能保持下去，或者为什么存在一条万有引力定律，我们则不清楚。

对自然的描述正是我们在这里要关心的。从这个观点出发，气体以及实际上所有的物质都是无数运动着的原子。这样我们站在海边所见到的许多东西马上可以联系起来了。首先是压力，它来自原子与壁或者某个东西的碰撞；如果原子的运动平均而言都沿着一个方向，这种原子的漂移运动就是风；而无规则的内部运动就是热。某个地方有过多的原子集结在一起时，就形成过剩密度的波，当波前进时，把成堆的原子推向更远的地方，等等。这种过剩密度的波就是声波。能够理解这么多事情的确是惊人的成就。在前一章里我们已经说明过一些这样的事情。

粒子有哪些种类？在当时认为有 92 种。那时已发现有 92 种不同的原子，各按其化学性质而被赋予不同的名称。

其次的问题是，「短程力」是什么？为什么碳吸引一个（有时两个）而不是三个氧？原子间的相互作用的机制是什么？是万有引力吗？答案是否定的。万有引力实在太弱了。于是让我们来设想一种类似于万有引力那样的与距离平方成反比的力，不过它在强度上远远超过前者，此外还有一个差别：在重力作用下，每个物体彼此吸引，但现在我们设想有两类「东西」，而这种新的力（当然就是所谓电力）具有同类相斥而异类相吸的特性。具有这样强的作用的「东西」就称为电荷。

那么，我们会得到什么结果呢？假定我们有两个异类电荷，一正一负，并且彼此十分靠近。现在，在若干距离之外，还有另一个电荷。它会感到吸引吗？实际上它几乎不会感到什么作用，因为如果前两个电荷的大小相等，来自一个电荷的吸引被来自另一个电荷的排斥所抵消，所以，在任何可估计的距离上只有很小的一点作用力。另方面，如果我们使第三个

电荷非常靠近前两个时，就会发生吸引作用。因为同类电荷的斥力与异类电荷的引力倾向于使异类电荷靠近而使同类电荷远离。这样，排斥作用就将小于吸引作用。这就是为什么由正、负电荷组成的原子相互离开较远时只感受到很小一点作用力（重力除外），而当它们彼此靠近时，就能够互相「看到内部」而重新安排其电荷，结果产生极强的相互作用的原因。原子间作用力的最终基础是电的作用。由于这种力是如此巨大，以致所有正的与负的电荷通常都以尽可能紧密的方式结合在一起。所有的事物，甚至我们自己，都由极精细的和彼此强烈作用着的正、负微粒所组成，所有正的微粒与所有负的微粒正好抵消。有时，碰巧我们「擦」去了一些负电荷或正电荷（通常擦去负电荷较为容易），在这种情况下将会发现电力不再平衡，于是就能看到电的吸引作用。

为了对电力作用究竟比引力作用大多少有个概念，我们举出大小为 1mm，相距为 30m 的两粒沙子为例。假如它们之间的作用力没有抵消，每个电荷都吸引所有其他电荷而不考虑同类电荷间的斥力，那么，两颗沙粒之间的作用力会有多大呢？两者间将会产生 3×10° 的力！你瞧，只要正电荷或负电荷的数目有一点点极小的过剩或欠缺，就足以产生可观的电效应。当然，这就是你们为什么不能看出带电体与非带电体之间的差别的原因一一所牵涉的粒子数目少得无论在物体的重量上或者形状上都很难造成什么差别。

有了这样的图像，对原子就比较容易理解了。人们认为原子的中心是一个带正电的质量甚大的「原子核」，核周围围绕着一定数量的很轻而带有负电的「电子」。让我们稍稍超前点提一下：在原子核里也发现了两类粒子一质子和中子，它们的重量几乎相同，并且十分重。质子带正电，中子则呈中性。如果我们有一个原子，其核内有六个质子，从而四周环绕着六个电子（在通常的物质世界中负粒子都是电子，与组成原子核的质子和中子相比，它们是很轻的），在化学周期表上这个原子的序数是 6, 名称是碳。原子序数为 8 的物质叫做氧，等等。因为化学性质取决于核外的电子，实际上它只取决于核外有多少个电子，所以种物质的化学性质只由电子的数目所决定（化学家的全部元素的名称实际上可以用 1,2, 3,4,5, 等等编号来称呼）。我们可以说「元素 6」，表示六个电子，以代替「碳」这个名称。当然，在先前发现元素时，人们并不知道它们可以用这种方式来编号。此外，这又会使事情复杂化，因此，宁可对这些元素定一个名称和符号，这比用编号来称呼元素来得更好。

关于电的作用人们还发现了更多事情。对电相互作用的自然解释是，两个物体简单地互相吸引：正的吸引负的。然而后来发现用这种观点来描述电的相互作用并不妥当。更合适的描述这种情况的观点是：在某种意义上，正电荷的存在使空间的「状况」发生畸变，或者说在空间造成了一种「状况」。于是当我们将负电荷放到这个空间里后，它就会感受到一个作用力。这种产生力的潜在可能性就叫做电场。当把一个电子放入电场时，我们就说它受到「拉曳」。于是我们就有了两条规则：(1) 电荷产生电场；(2) 电荷在电场中会受到力的作用而运动。如果我们讨论下述现象的话，建立这两条规则的理由就清楚了：假如我们使某物体（比方说梳子）带电，然后把一张带电的纸片放在一定距离之外，当我们来回移动梳子时，纸片就会有反应，并且总是指向梳子。如果我们使梳子晃动得快些，就会发现纸片的运动有点滞后，即作用有所延迟（起先，当我们相当慢地晃动梳子时，我们发现一种错综复杂的现象，这就是磁。磁的影响与作相对运动的电荷有关，所以磁力和电的作用力实际上可以归之于ー个场，就像同一件事的两个不同的方面。变化的电场不能离开磁而存在）。假如我们把纸片移得更远，滞后就更大，这时能观察到一件有趣的事：虽然两个带电体之间的作用力应当与距离平方成反比，但是我们发现，当摇动一个电荷时，电作用的影响范围要比起初所猜想的大得多。这就是说，作用的减弱要比反平方的规则来得慢。

这里有一个类比：如果我们在水池里，而在近处漂浮着一个软木塞，我们可以用另一个

软木塞划水来「直接」移动那个木塞。如果现在你只注意两个软木塞，你能看到的将是一个

立即响应另个的运动一一在软木塞之间存在着某种「相互作用」。当然，我们实际上所做的只是搅动了水；然后水又去扰动另一个木塞。于是我们就能提出一条「定律」：如果稍微划下水，那么水中附近的物体就会移动。当然，假若第二个软木塞离得较远，则它将几乎不动，因为我们只是局部地搅动水。另一方面，假如我们晃动木塞，就会产生一个新的现象，即这部分水推动了那部分水，等等，于是波就传播开去，这样，由于晃动，就有一种波及分远的影响和一种振荡的影响，这是无法用直接相互作用来理解的。所以那种直接作用的概念必须用水的存在来代替，或者，对于电的情形，用我们所谓的电磁场来代替。

电磁场能传送各种波，其中的一些就是光波，另一些波用在无线电广播里，但它们的总

名称是电磁波。这些振荡的波可以有各种频率，一种波和另一种波之间的唯一的真正差别只是振荡的频率。假如我们越来越快地来回晃动电荷，并且注视着所产生的效应时，我们将得到一系列不同的效应，只要用一个数，即每秒钟振荡的次数，就能把这些效应统一起来。通常在我们住房墙上电路里流动的电流所产生的扰动约为 100Hz。如果我们把频率提高到 500kHz 或 1000kHz，我们就「在空气中了」*，因为这正是无线电广播所用的频率范围（当然，广播与空气毫无关系！没有任何空气也能进行广播）。假如再提高频率，那么就进入调频广播和电视所用的波段。再上去，我们使用一种极短的波，比如雷达所用的波。频率再增高，我们就无需用仪器来「看」这种波了，而用眼睛就能够看到它。在频率范围为 51014~ 5×10Hz 的时，只要有可能使带电的梳子晃动得这样快，我们的眼睛就能见到带电梳子的振动，像红光蓝光或紫光，视振动的频率而定。低于上述频率范围的称为红外，高于此范围的称为紫外。从物理学家的观点来看，我们能看见某种频率范围的波这个事实并不使这一部分电磁波谱比其他部分有什么更令人注意的地方，但是从人类的观点来看，这当然是更有趣的。如果我们把频率提得更高，于是就得到射线。射线不是别的，只是频率极高的光而已。如果再提高频率，就得到 γ 射线。射线与 γ 射线这两个名称在使用时几乎是同义的，通常将原子核发出的电磁射线称为 γ 射线，而从原子中发出的这种高能的电磁射线就称为射线。但是不论它们的起源如何，当频率相同时，它们在物理上是无法区别的。如果我们进到更高的频率，比如说 102Hz，我们发现可以人工制造这样的波，例如用加利福尼亚理工学院的同步加速器。我们还可以在宇宙线里发现频率出奇的高的电磁波一一具有甚至比它还快 1000 倍的振荡，而这些波目前还不能由我们来控制。

82-3 量子物理学

说明了电磁场概念和电磁场能传送波后，我们很快就认识到，这些波的行为实际上十分奇怪，看起来完全不像波。在频率较高时它们的行为更像粒子！正是在 1920 年后发展起来的量子力学解释了这种奇怪的行为。在 1920 年之前，爱因斯坦就已改变了把空间看作是三维空间，把时间看成单独存在的这种图像。他首先把它们组合在一起，并且称之为时空，然后又进一步用弯曲的时空来描绘万有引力，这样，「舞台」就变为时空，而万有引力则大概是时空的一种调整。以后，人们又发现有关原子运动的规则也是有问题的：在原子世界中，「性」与「力」的力学法则是不正确的一一牛顿定律已不再成立。人们发现小尺度范围内事物的行为与大尺度范围内事物的行为没有任何相似之处。这给物理学造成困难一但又十分有趣。之所以困难，是由于事物在小尺度范围内的表现如此「反常」，我们对之没有直接的经验。在这里，事物的表现完全不像我们所知道的任何事情，因而除了用解析的方式，用任何其他方法都不可能描写这种特性。这的确是困难的，需要作大量的想象。

量子力学有许多观点。首先，一个粒子既有确定的位置也有确定的速度这种概念已被抛弃，那是不正确的想法。表明经典物理是怎样不正确的一个例子是，在量子力学中有这样条定则：不可能既知道某个粒子在什么地方，又知道它运动得多快。动量的不确定性与位 置的不确定性是并协的，两者的乘积是常数。我们可以把这条定律写成△x△か≥/2r，在以后将会更详尽地解释它。这条定则解释了这样一个十分神秘的佯谬：如果原子是由正负电荷所构成，那么为什么负电荷不是简单地位于正电荷的顶端（它们彼此是吸引的），从而彼

此靠拢以至于完全抵消？为仕么原子这么大？为什么原子核在中心，而其周围环绕着一些电子？起先曾认为原子核很大，但事实并非如此，它是非常小的。一个原子的直径约为 10°cm，一个原子核的直径约为 10-1cm。如果我们有一个原子，为了看到原子核，就要把整个原子放大到一个大房间那样大，这时原子核才是一个刚刚可以用眼晴分辨出来的斑点，但是原子的几乎所有重量都集中在这个无比小的原子核上。是什么原因使电子没有直接落入原子核呢？正是由于上述的原理。如果电子在原子核里出现，我们就会精确地知道它们的位置，而不确定性原理则要求它们具有很大的（不过是不确定的）动量，即很大的动能。电子具有这样大的能量就要脱离原子核。然而这些电子作出了让步：由于不确定性，它们为自己留下一个狭小的空间，于是以由这个定则所决定的最小的运动晃动着（记得我们曾经说过，当晶体冷却到绝对零度时，原子并没有停止运动，它们仍然在晃动，为什么？如果它们停止运动，我们就能知道它们在什么地方，而且它们不运动，这就违反了不确定性原理：我们不能既知道它们在哪里，又知道它们以什么速度运动，所以它们必须在那里不断地摆动）。

另一个由量子力学带来的在科学的观念和哲学方面最有趣的变化是，在任何情形下要精确地预言会发生什么事都是不可能的。比如我们有可能使一个原子处于准备发光的状态，在原子发光时，可以利用探测光子的方法进行测量（这一点我们马上就要讲的），但是，我们无法预计它将在仕么时侯发光，或者在有几个原子的情况下，究竟哪一个原子将发光。你们可能说，这是由于某种我们还没有足够仔细观察过的内部「转轮」在起作用。然而，这里根本没有什么内部的转轮。按照我们今天的理解，大自然的表现是这样的：根本不可能精确地预言在一定的实验中究竟会发生什么事情，这是一件糟透了的事。事实上，哲学家曾经声称科学所必需的基本东西之一就是，每当你安排了同样的条件时，那么发生的必定是同件事。但是，这完全不正确，它并不是科学的基本条件。事实是所发生的并不是同一件事，我们所能得到的只是发生一些什么的统计平均。不过，科学并没有完全崩溃。顺便说一下，哲学家们讲了一大套科学之绝对必需是什么，但就像人们所能看到的那样，这些总是相当天真的，甚至还是错误的。例如，某个哲学家宣称，对科学的成就来说十分重要的是，如果同个实验先在某处（比如说在斯德哥尔摩）做，然后在另一处（比如说在基多）做，那么必定会出现同样的结果。完全错了。对科学来说，这并不是必然的。它可能是一个经验事实，但并不是必然的情况。比如有一个实验是在斯德哥尔摩观察天空，这时会看到北极光，如果在基多则看不到这种现象，这就是出现了不同的情况。「但是」，你会说：「这是一件与外部情况有关的事，如果你把自己关在斯德哥尔摩的一个房间里，拉下窗帘的话，那么会发现什么差别吗？」肯定会。假如我们在一个万向接头上挂一个摆，让它开始摆动，它就会差不多在一个平面里摆动，但也并不完全如此。在斯德哥尔摩，平面会缓慢地转动着。但是在基多就不会。在那里，窗帘也是垂下的。这件事的发生并没有引起科学的毁灭。科学的基本假设，它的基本哲学观念是什么呢？我们在第 1 章里讲到过：实验是任何观念的正确性的唯一试金石。假如结果是在基多所做的大多数实验与在斯德哥尔摩所做的实验效果一样，那么这「大多数实验」就可用来提出某种一般性的定律，至于对那些效果不同的实验我们就将说：「这是由于斯德哥尔摩周围的环境不同所引起的。」我们将能想出一些办法来概括实验结果，而没有必要在事先就被告诚说，这些办法看起来像什么。假如有人告诉我们说，同样的实验总是产生同样的结果，这固然很好。但是当我们试了一下后，发现并非如此，因而结论的确就是并非如此。我们正是必须相信自己所看到的，然后才能借助于实际的经验来形成我们的一切其他观念。

现在让我们回到量子力学和基本物理上来。当然，我们在此刻还不能详细叙述量子力学的原理，因为它们是颇难理解的。我们将假定它们成立，然后叙述一下某些结果。其中个是，我们通常视作为波的那些事物也具有粒子的特性，而粒子则具有波的特性。实际上每一种事物的行为都是一样的，不存在波和粒子的区别。这样，量子力学就将场的概念与场的波与粒子统一起来。的确，频率低时，现象的场的特性比较明显，或者说作为日常经验的近似描写时比较有用。但当频率增加时，现象的粒子特性对于我们通常用来作测量用的仪器来说更为明显。实际上，虽然我们提到过许多频率，但目前还没有探测到任何直接涉及频率在 102Hz 以上的现象，我们只是在假定了量子力学的波粒二象性概念是正确的之后，根据有关规则从粒子的能量来推断出这些较高的频率的。

于是，我们对电磁相互作用有了新的见解。我们把一种新类型的粒子加入到电子、质子及中子的行列，这种新的粒子称为光子。而这种电子与质子相互作用的新的见解被称为量子电动力学，它就是电磁理论，不过其中的一切在量子力学上都是正确的。这是光和物质，或电场与电荷之间相互作用的基本理论，就物理学来说它是我们最伟大的成就。在这个理论中，我们得到了除万有引力与原子核过程之外的所有一般现象的根本规则。比如，从量子电动力学可以得出所有已知的电学、力学和化学定律：弹子碰撞的定律、导线在磁场中运动的定律一氧化碳的比热、霓虹灯的色彩、盐的密度、以及氢与氧形成水的反应等全都是这理论的推论。所有这些细节，如果简单到能使我们运用近似方法的话，都可以得出，这实际上当然不可能，不过我们总能对发生的事多少有所理解。目前，在原子核外面还没有发现量子电动力学定律有什么例外，对于原子核我们不知道是否会有例外，因为对于核内的过程我们简直还不太清楚。

这样，在原则上，量子电动力学是一切化学以及生命的理论一一如果生命最后归结为化学，因而也就归结为物理的话（因为化学本身已经归结为物理，涉及化学中的那部分物理早就知道了）。不仅如此，量子电动力学这个伟大的理论还预言了许多新的事实。首先，它说明了甚高能光子、射线等的性质。它还预言了另一个十分出乎意外的事：除电子外，还应当有同样质量、但带有正电荷的称为正电子的粒子，并且这两种粒子碰在一起时，会彼此湮没而放出光或 γ 射线（其实，光与 y 射线完全是一回事，只是频率不同而已）。这件事情的推广一即对每个粒子总有一个反粒子一现在知道是正确的。电子的反粒子有另一个名称，即正电子，但其他大多数反粒子，就称反某某子，如反质子、反中子。在量子电动力学中提出了两个基本数据一一电子质量与电荷，所有世界上其他的数被认为可以从这两个数据推导出来。实际上，这不完全正确，因为化学还有一整套数据，它告诉我们原子核是多重，这就把我们引导到下一部分内容中去了

2-4 原子核与粒子

原子核是由什么组成的，这些东西又是怎样结合在一起的？人们发现，原子核是靠巨大的作用力结合在一起的，当这种力释放时，其放出来的能量比化学能大得多，前者与后者之比就好像原子弹爆炸与 TNT 炸药的爆炸相比一样。当然，这是因为原子弹爆炸时与原子核里的变化有关，而 TNT 的爆炸则与原子外层的电子变化有关。问题是，究竟是什么力使原子核中的质子与中子结合在一起呢？汤川秀树提出，就好像电相互作用可以与一种粒子光子联系起来一样，中子与质子之间的作用力也有某种场，当这个场晃动时，就好像个粒子一样。所以除去中子与质子外，在世界上应当有一些别的粒子，而汤川能从已知的核力特征推导出这些粒子的性质。比如，他预言它们应当有二三百个电子那样大的质量。你瞧！在宇宙间竟然真的发现了这样质量的粒子！但是，后来发现这并不正是预言的粒子它被称为 μ 子。

然而，没有过多少时候，在 1947 年或 1948 年就发现了另一个粒子ー - x 介子，它满足汤川的判据。这样，除去质子与中子外，为了得到核力，我们还必须加上介子。你可能会说，「太好了！借助这个理论就可以像汤川所希望的那样建立起利用 π 介子的量子核动力学，然后看看它是否成立。如果成立的话，那么每件事都可得到解释了。」不幸的是，包含在这种理论中的计算是如此困难，以至于一直到今天，已将近 20 年了，从来还没有一个人能够从这个理论中得出什么结果来，或者能够用实验去验证一下。

所以我们被这个理论难住了，我们不知道它究竟是正确的还是错误的，但却知道它有点小小的错误，或者至少是不完全的。正当我们在理论上徘徊并且试图用这个理论计算出结果时，实验物理学家发现了一些事情。比如，他们早已发现了 μ 子，而我们却还不知道把它归到哪里去。而且，在宇宙线里，还发现了大量的其他「额外」粒子。今天，我们已发现了大约 30 种粒子。理解所有这些粒子的相互关系是非常困难的一一大自然要它们来干什么？这一个粒子与另一个粒子之间的联系是什么？我们今天并没有把这些不同的粒子理解为同件事情的不同的方面。我们有这么多相互无关的粒子这件事本身就表明，我们还没有个能够说明这么多相互无关的信息的良好理论。由于量子电动力学的伟大成功，我们具备了一定的核物理知识，它是一种粗糙的半经验半理论的知识，假设一种质子与中子间的力的类型，然后看看会发生什么事情，但是并不确切知道力的来源。除此以外，我们很少取得进展。在化学上，人们曾搜集大量的化学元素，以后突然在元素之间显现出一种没有预期到的关系，它就体现在门捷列夫元素周期表中。比如，钠和钾的化学性质几乎是相同的，它们就在周期表的同一行里。对于新粒子而言，我们一直也在探索着这种门捷列夫式的表。有张这样的新粒子表是由美国的盖尔曼与日本的西岛各自独立做出的。他们分类的基础是个新的数，类似于电子的电荷，这种新的数叫做「奇异数」S，对每个粒子都指定了这样数，它像电荷一样是守恒的，即在核力的反应中保持不变。

表 2-2 列出了所有的粒子。眼下我们对之还无法讨论得更多。但是这张表至少向你们表明我们不知道的东西有多少。每个粒子下写着它的质量，其单位是兆电子伏（MeV）。1MeV 等于 1.782102g。选取这种单位的理由是出自历史的原因，我们现在不去说它。质量大的粒子在表中放在较高的位置。可以看到，中子与质子的质量是差不多相同的，在垂直的列内放置有同样电荷的粒子，所有的中性粒子都放在同一列内，所有带正电的粒子在这一列的右边，所有带负电的粒子则在左边

表 2-2 基本粒子

表 2-2 中实线标出的是粒子，虚线标明的是「共振态」。表中略去了几个粒子，包括重要的零质量、零电荷的粒子，即光子与引力子，它们并不属于重子介子一轻子分类图。此外，还有某些较新的共振态（K,9, n）也不包括在这里。介子的反粒子已列在本表内，但轻子与重子的反粒子就需要另列一张表了，它看起来正好是目前这张表对零电荷列的反演。虽然除去电子、中微子、光子、引力子和质子外，所有的粒子都是不稳定的，但是在这里只列出了共振态的衰变产物。奇异数并不适用于轻子，因为它们与核之间并没有强作用。

所有与中子、质子放在一起的粒子统称为子。共存在着以下几种：A 介子，质量为 1154Me。另外还有三个：介子、介子和 ° 介子，质量是相近的。这里还有成群或者说成多重态的粒子，带有差不多相同的质量，相差不到 1% 或 2%。在多重态内的每个粒子都有同样的奇异数。第一个多重态是质子ー中子二重态，以后是单重态（A 介子），再以后是三重态，最后是二重态。最近，在 1961 年，又发现少数几个粒子，但它们都是粒子吗？它们的寿命是如此短暂，当刚形成时，几乎就立刻蜕变了，所以我们不知道它们究竟应被认为是新的粒子，还是在它们蜕变成介子及 x 介子时后两者之间某种确定能量的「共振」作用呢？

除去重子外，其他包括在核内相互作用中的粒子称为介子。首先是 x 介子，有三种形态：正、负及中性，它们组成了另一多重态。我们还发现一些新的称为 K 介子的粒子，它们作为 K 及 K 而出现。其次，每个粒子都有反粒子，除非一个粒子是它自己的反粒子。例如 π 和 + 是一对反粒子，但是是它自己的反粒子；K 及 K + 是反粒子对，K° 及 K 也是反粒子对。附带说一下，在 1961 年我们又发现了一些介子或可能的介子，它们几乎即刻就蜕变了，有一个称为 o 的东西带有 780MeV 的质量，分解为三个 x 介子，有一个还不怎么确定的东西分解为两个 x 介子。那些被称为介子与重子的粒子与介子的反粒子放在同一张表里，但重子的反粒子必须放到另一张通过零电荷列「反射」而来的表里去。

门捷列夫周期表是很完美的，除去有一些稀土元素挂在外面。同样，这里也有一些粒子在表外，它们在核内的相互作用不强，跟核相互作用根本无关，跟核之间也没有强相互作用（我们所指的是那种强的核能相互作用）。它们被称为轻子，主要有如下几种：电子，其质量很小，只有 0.510MeV；然后是 μ 子，质量约为电子的 206 倍。根据所有的实验，我们今天所能说的电子与子之间的差别仅仅是质量不同而已，除了子比电子重外，两者在其他方面都完全一样。为什么一个比另一个重？ュ子有什么用？我们不知道。此外，有一种轻子是中性的，叫做中微子，具有零质量，事实上，现在知道有两类中微子，一类与电子有关，另类与 μ 子有关。

最后，还有两种与核内其他粒子间没有强作用的粒子：一个是光子，另一个（或许）是具有零质量的引力子一假如引力场也有类似量子力学的原理的话（引力的量子化理论还没有建立）。

什么是「零质量」？这里所标示的质量是粒子在静止时的质量。事实上，一个粒子具有零质量在某种程度上就意味着它不可能静止。光子是永远不会静止的，它一直以 186000mis（即 300000km·s-1) 的速度运动。当我们在适当的时候学习了相对论的内容后，对于质量就会理解得更多一些。

这样，我们就面对着一大群粒子，它们看来都是物质的基本组成部分。幸运的是，这些

粒子彼此之间的相互作用并不全都是不同的。事实上，粒子之间的相互作用看来可以分为四类，按强度降低的顺序排列时，它们就是：核力、电相互作用、衰变作用以及引力。光子 与所有带电粒子会发生耦合，作用的强度用某个数（1/137) 来度量。这种耦合的详细定律已经知道，那就是量子电动力学。引力和所有的能量发生耦合，但它的耦合是非常弱的，远远小于电的作用，这条定律也已经知道了。然后，还存在着所谓的弱衰变一衰变，它使中子蜕变为质子、电子及中微子，其过程是比较慢的，这种作用的定律只是部分地知道。还有所谓的强相互作用一介子 - 重子相互作用，其强度为 1, 它的规律完全不知道，虽然已经知道几条法则，比如重子的数目在任何反应中都不改变。

这些就是当代物理学的惊人的状况。总结一下，我可以这样说在核外，看来一切都知道了；在核内，量子力学是正确的，还没有发现量子力学原理失效的情况。可以说：容纳我们所有知识的舞台是相对论性时空；许引力也包括在时空之中。我们不知道，宇宙是怎样开始的，我们从来没有做过实验来精确地检査在某个微小距离下的时空观念，所以只知道在那个距离以上我们的时空观念行得通。我们还应当补充说：这个伟大的国际象棋赛的规则就是量子力学的原理，到现在为止我们可以说，这些原则应用于新的粒子时与应用于过去已发现的粒子一样成功。核力的起源将我们引向新的粒子，但是遗憾的是出现的粒子实在太多，以至于使我们感到迷惑不解。虽然我们已经知道在它们之间存在着一些非常出人意外的关系，但对它们的相互关系缺乏完整的理解。看来我们正摸索着前进，逐渐趋近于对亚原子粒子世界的理解；但是，我们实在不清楚，在这种摸索中我们还必须走多远。
