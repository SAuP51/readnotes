# 0201. Basic Physics

2-1 IntroductionIn this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we haveabout physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shallnot discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you willlearn these details in due time.

The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms,and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore andlook at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshingmotion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun andthe blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardnessand permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger anddisease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought.Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is alwaysas complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we askquestions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitudeof aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number ofelemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations.

For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhapsnothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? Ifwe understood rocks, would we also understand the sand and the moon? Is thewind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in thesea? What common features do diﬀerent movements have? What is common todiﬀerent kinds of sound? How many diﬀerent colors are there? And so on. Inthis way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which atﬁrst sight look diﬀerent, with the hope that we may be able to reduce the numberof diﬀerent things and thereby understand them better.

2-1

A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers tosuch questions. Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call thescientiﬁc method. We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of ourbasic view of what is sometimes called fundamental physics, or fundamental ideaswhich have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method.What do we mean by「understanding」something? We can imagine that thiscomplicated array of moving things which constitutes「the world」is somethinglike a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of thegame. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to dois to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventuallycatch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean byfundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be ableto understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it istoo complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must knowthat it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select thebest move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature,only much more so; but we may be able at least to ﬁnd all the rules. Actually,we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castlingis going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of therules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, becausealmost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow theplays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next.We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of thegame. If we know the rules, we consider that we「understand」the world.

How can we tell whether the rules which we「guess」at are really right if wecannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways.First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature,to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what willhappen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the boardthere may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we can ﬁgure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less speciﬁc rules derived fromthem. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that itmoves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves maybe made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without beingable to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motionby ﬁnding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a longtime, until all of a sudden we ﬁnd that it is on a black square (what happened of

2-2

course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening,and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics.For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an over-all way, evenwhen we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a newrule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomenaare of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not theplaces where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude butprobably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. Whilewe may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps wecan roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protectit, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. Inthe same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being ableto see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game.At ﬁrst the phenomena of nature were roughly divided into classes, like heat,electricity, mechanics, magnetism, properties of substances, chemical phenomena,light or optics, x-rays, nuclear physics, gravitation, meson phenomena, etc.However, the aim is to see complete nature as diﬀerent aspects of one set ofphenomena. That is the problem in basic theoretical physics, today—to ﬁndthe laws behind experiment; to amalgamate these classes. Historically, we havealways been able to amalgamate them, but as time goes on new things are found.We were amalgamating very well, when all of a sudden x-rays were found. Thenwe amalgamated some more, and mesons were found. Therefore, at any stageof the game, it always looks rather messy. A great deal is amalgamated, butthere are always many wires or threads hanging out in all directions. That is thesituation today, which we shall try to describe.

Some historic examples of amalgamation are the following. First, take heatand mechanics. When atoms are in motion, the more motion, the more heat thesystem contains, and so heat and all temperature eﬀects can be represented bythe laws of mechanics. Another tremendous amalgamation was the discovery ofthe relation between electricity, magnetism, and light, which were found to bediﬀerent aspects of the same thing, which we call today the electromagnetic ﬁeld.Another amalgamation is the uniﬁcation of chemical phenomena, the variousproperties of various substances, and the behavior of atomic particles, which isin the quantum mechanics of chemistry.The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalgamate everything,and merely discover that this world represents diﬀerent aspects of one thing?

2-3

Nobody knows. All we know is that as we go along, we ﬁnd that we can amalga-mate pieces, and then we ﬁnd some pieces that do not ﬁt, and we keep trying toput the jigsaw puzzle together. Whether there are a ﬁnite number of pieces, andwhether there is even a border to the puzzle, is of course unknown. It will neverbe known until we ﬁnish the picture, if ever. What we wish to do here is to seeto what extent this amalgamation process has gone on, and what the situationis at present, in understanding basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set ofprinciples. To express it in a simple manner, what are things made of and howfew elements are there?

2-2 Physics before 1920It is a little diﬃcult to begin at once with the present view, so we shall ﬁrstsee how things looked in about 1920 and then take a few things out of thatpicture. Before 1920, our world picture was something like this: The「stage」onwhich the universe goes is the three-dimensional space of geometry, as describedby Euclid, and things change in a medium called time. The elements on thestage are particles, for example the atoms, which have some properties. First, theproperty of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same directionunless forces act upon it. The second element, then, is forces, which were thenthought to be of two varieties: First, an enormously complicated, detailed kindof interaction force which held the various atoms in diﬀerent combinations in acomplicated way, which determined whether salt would dissolve faster or slowerwhen we raise the temperature. The other force that was known was a long-rangeinteraction—a smooth and quiet attraction—which varied inversely as the squareof the distance, and was called gravitation. This law was known and was verysimple. Why things remain in motion when they are moving, or why there is alaw of gravitation was, of course, not known.

A description of nature is what we are concerned with here. From this pointof view, then, a gas, and indeed all matter, is a myriad of moving particles. Thusmany of the things we saw while standing at the seashore can immediately beconnected. First the pressure: this comes from the collisions of the atoms with thewalls or whatever; the drift of the atoms, if they are all moving in one directionon the average, is wind; the random internal motions are the heat. There arewaves of excess density, where too many particles have collected, and so as theyrush oﬀ they push up piles of particles farther out, and so on. This wave of excess

2-4

density is sound. It is a tremendous achievement to be able to understand somuch. Some of these things were described in the previous chapter.What kinds of particles are there? There were considered to be 92 at thattime: 92 diﬀerent kinds of atoms were ultimately discovered. They had diﬀerentnames associated with their chemical properties.

The next part of the problem was, what are the short-range forces? Why doescarbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but not three oxygens? Whatis the machinery of interaction between atoms? Is it gravitation? The answeris no. Gravity is entirely too weak. But imagine a force analogous to gravity,varying inversely with the square of the distance, but enormously more powerfuland having one diﬀerence. In gravity everything attracts everything else, butnow imagine that there are two kinds of「things,」and that this new force (whichis the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes repel but unlikesattract. The「thing」that carries this strong interaction is called charge.Then what do we have? Suppose that we have two unlikes that attract eachother, a plus and a minus, and that they stick very close together. Suppose wehave another charge some distance away. Would it feel any attraction? It wouldfeel practically none, because if the ﬁrst two are equal in size, the attraction forthe one and the repulsion for the other balance out. Therefore there is very littleforce at any appreciable distance. On the other hand, if we get very close withthe extra charge, attraction arises, because the repulsion of likes and attractionof unlikes will tend to bring unlikes closer together and push likes farther apart.Then the repulsion will be less than the attraction. This is the reason why theatoms, which are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel verylittle force when they are separated by appreciable distance (aside from gravity).When they come close together, they can「see inside」each other and rearrangetheir charges, with the result that they have a very strong interaction. Theultimate basis of an interaction between the atoms is electrical. Since this forceis so enormous, all the plusses and all minuses will normally come together inas intimate a combination as they can. All things, even ourselves, are made ofﬁne-grained, enormously strongly interacting plus and minus parts, all neatlybalanced out. Once in a while, by accident, we may rub oﬀ a few minuses or afew plusses (usually it is easier to rub oﬀ minuses), and in those circumstanceswe ﬁnd the force of electricity unbalanced, and we can then see the eﬀects of theseelectrical attractions.To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravitation, considertwo grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart. If the force between

2-5

them were not balanced, if everything attracted everything else instead of likesrepelling, so that there were no cancellation, how much force would there be?There would be a force of three million tons between the two! You see, there isvery, very little excess or deﬁcit of the number of negative or positive chargesnecessary to produce appreciable electrical eﬀects. This is, of course, the reasonwhy you cannot see the diﬀerence between an electrically charged or unchargedthing—so few particles are involved that they hardly make a diﬀerence in theweight or size of an object.

With this picture the atoms were easier to understand. They were thoughtto have a「nucleus」at the center, which is positively electrically charged andvery massive, and the nucleus is surrounded by a certain number of「electrons」which are very light and negatively charged. Now we go a little ahead in ourstory to remark that in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of particles,protons and neutrons, almost of the same weight and very heavy. The protonsare electrically charged and the neutrons are neutral. If we have an atom with sixprotons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded by six electrons (the negativeparticles in the ordinary world of matter are all electrons, and these are verylight compared with the protons and neutrons which make nuclei), this would beatom number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon. Atom numbereight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend upon theelectrons on the outside, and in fact only upon how many electrons there are. Sothe chemical properties of a substance depend only on a number, the numberof electrons. (The whole list of elements of the chemists really could have beencalled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Instead of saying「carbon,」we could say「element six,」meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements were ﬁrst discovered, itwas not known that they could be numbered that way, and secondly, it wouldmake everything look rather complicated. It is better to have names and symbolsfor these things, rather than to call everything by number.)

More was discovered about the electrical force. The natural interpretation ofelectrical interaction is that two objects simply attract each other: plus againstminus. However, this was discovered to be an inadequate idea to represent it.A more adequate representation of the situation is to say that the existence ofthe positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a「condition」in space,so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This potentialityfor producing a force is called an electric ﬁeld. When we put an electron in anelectric ﬁeld, we say it is「pulled.」We then have two rules: (a) charges make aﬁeld, and (b) charges in ﬁelds have forces on them and move. The reason for

2-6

this will become clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we wereto charge a body, say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece ofpaper at a distance and move the comb back and forth, the paper will respond byalways pointing to the comb. If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that thepaper is a little behind, there is a delay in the action. (At the ﬁrst stage, whenwe move the comb rather slowly, we ﬁnd a complication which is magnetism.Magnetic inﬂuences have to do with charges in relative motion, so magneticforces and electric forces can really be attributed to one ﬁeld, as two diﬀerentaspects of exactly the same thing. A changing electric ﬁeld cannot exist withoutmagnetism.) If we move the charged paper farther out, the delay is greater. Thenan interesting thing is observed. Although the forces between two charged objectsshould go inversely as the square of the distance, it is found, when we shake acharge, that the inﬂuence extends very much farther out than we would guess atﬁrst sight. That is, the eﬀect falls oﬀ more slowly than the inverse square.Here is an analogy: If we are in a pool of water and there is a ﬂoating corkvery close by, we can move it「directly」by pushing the water with anothercork. If you looked only at the two corks, all you would see would be that onemoved immediately in response to the motion of the other—there is some kind of「interaction」between them. Of course, what we really do is to disturb the water;the water then disturbs the other cork. We could make up a「law」that if youpushed the water a little bit, an object close by in the water would move. If itwere farther away, of course, the second cork would scarcely move, for we movethe water locally. On the other hand, if we jiggle the cork a new phenomenonis involved, in which the motion of the water moves the water there, etc., andwaves travel away, so that by jiggling, there is an inﬂuence very much farther out,an oscillatory inﬂuence, that cannot be understood from the direct interaction.Therefore the idea of direct interaction must be replaced with the existence ofthe water, or in the electrical case, with what we call the electromagnetic ﬁeld.The electromagnetic ﬁeld can carry waves; some of these waves are light,others are used in radio broadcasts, but the general name is electromagneticwaves. These oscillatory waves can have various frequencies. The only thing thatis really diﬀerent from one wave to another is the frequency of oscillation. If weshake a charge back and forth more and more rapidly, and look at the eﬀects, weget a whole series of diﬀerent kinds of eﬀects, which are all uniﬁed by specifyingbut one number, the number of oscillations per second. The usual「pickup」thatwe get from electric currents in the circuits in the walls of a building have afrequency of about one hundred cycles per second. If we increase the frequency to

500 or 1000 kilocycles (1 kilocycle = 1000 cycles) per second, we are「on the air,」for this is the frequency range which is used for radio broadcasts. (Of course ithas nothing to do with the air! We can have radio broadcasts without any air.) Ifwe again increase the frequency, we come into the range that is used for FM andTV. Going still further, we use certain short waves, for example for radar. Stillhigher, and we do not need an instrument to「see」the stuﬀ, we can see it withthe human eye. In the range of frequency from 5 × 1014 to 1015 cycles per secondour eyes would see the oscillation of the charged comb, if we could shake it thatfast, as red, blue, or violet light, depending on the frequency. Frequencies belowthis range are called infrared, and above it, ultraviolet. The fact that we can seein a particular frequency range makes that part of the electromagnetic spectrumno more impressive than the other parts from a physicist’s standpoint, but froma human standpoint, of course, it is more interesting. If we go up even higher infrequency, we get x-rays. X-rays are nothing but very high-frequency light. If wego still higher, we get gamma rays. These two terms, x-rays and gamma rays,are used almost synonymously. Usually electromagnetic rays coming from nucleiare called gamma rays, while those of high energy from atoms are called x-rays,but at the same frequency they are indistinguishable physically, no matter whattheir source. If we go to still higher frequencies, say to 1024 cycles per second, weﬁnd that we can make those waves artiﬁcially, for example with the synchrotron

2-8

here at Caltech. We can ﬁnd electromagnetic waves with stupendously highfrequencies—with even a thousand times more rapid oscillation—in the wavesfound in cosmic rays. These waves cannot be controlled by us.

2-3 Quantum physicsHaving described the idea of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and that this ﬁeldcan carry waves, we soon learn that these waves actually behave in a strangeway which seems very unwavelike. At higher frequencies they behave muchmore like particles! It is quantum mechanics, discovered just after 1920, whichexplains this strange behavior. In the years before 1920, the picture of spaceas a three-dimensional space, and of time as a separate thing, was changed byEinstein, ﬁrst into a combination which we call space-time, and then still furtherinto a curved space-time to represent gravitation. So the「stage」is changedinto space-time, and gravitation is presumably a modiﬁcation of space-time.Then it was also found that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect.The mechanical rules of「inertia」and「forces」are wrong—Newton’s laws arewrong—in the world of atoms. Instead, it was discovered that things on a smallscale behave nothing like things on a large scale. That is what makes physicsdiﬃcult—and very interesting. It is hard because the way things behave on asmall scale is so「unnatural」; we have no direct experience with it. Here thingsbehave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behaviorin any other than analytic ways. It is diﬃcult, and takes a lot of imagination.Quantum mechanics has many aspects. In the ﬁrst place, the idea that aparticle has a deﬁnite location and a deﬁnite speed is no longer allowed; that iswrong. To give an example of how wrong classical physics is, there is a rule inquantum mechanics that says that one cannot know both where something is andhow fast it is moving. The uncertainty of the momentum and the uncertaintyof the position are complementary, and the product of the two is bounded bya small constant. We can write the law like this: ∆x ∆p ≥ /2, but we shallexplain it in more detail later. This rule is the explanation of a very mysteriousparadox: if the atoms are made out of plus and minus charges, why don’t theminus charges simply sit on top of the plus charges (they attract each other) andget so close as to completely cancel them out? Why are atoms so big? Why is thenucleus at the center with the electrons around it? It was ﬁrst thought that thiswas because the nucleus was so big; but no, the nucleus is very small. An atomhas a diameter of about 10−8 cm. The nucleus has a diameter of about 10−13 cm.

2-9

If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus, we would have to magnify ituntil the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus wouldbe a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but verynearly all the weight of the atom is in that inﬁnitesimal nucleus. What keeps theelectrons from simply falling in? This principle: If they were in the nucleus, wewould know their position precisely, and the uncertainty principle would thenrequire that they have a very large (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very largekinetic energy. With this energy they would break away from the nucleus. Theymake a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty andthen jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance with thisrule. (Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute zero, we said that theatoms do not stop moving, they still jiggle. Why? If they stopped moving, wewould know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is againstthe uncertainty principle. We cannot know where they are and how fast they aremoving, so they must be continually wiggling in there!)

Another most interesting change in the ideas and philosophy of science broughtabout by quantum mechanics is this: it is not possible to predict exactly what willhappen in any circumstance. For example, it is possible to arrange an atom whichis ready to emit light, and we can measure when it has emitted light by picking upa photon particle, which we shall describe shortly. We cannot, however, predictwhen it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms, which one is going to.You may say that this is because there are some internal「wheels」which we havenot looked at closely enough. No, there are no internal wheels; nature, as weunderstand it today, behaves in such a way that it is fundamentally impossibleto make a precise prediction of exactly what will happen in a given experiment.This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of thefundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions,the same thing must happen. This is simply not true, it is not a fundamentalcondition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that wecan ﬁnd only an average, statistically, as to what happens. Nevertheless, sciencehas not completely collapsed. Philosophers, incidentally, say a great deal aboutwhat is absolutely necessary for science, and it is always, so far as one can see,rather naive, and probably wrong. For example, some philosopher or other saidit is fundamental to the scientiﬁc eﬀort that if an experiment is performed in, say,Stockholm, and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the same resultsmust occur. That is quite false. It is not necessary that science do that; it may bea fact of experience, but it is not necessary. For example, if one of the experiments

2-10

is to look out at the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see itin Quito; that is a diﬀerent phenomenon.「But,」you say,「that is something thathas to do with the outside; can you close yourself up in a box in Stockholm andpull down the shade and get any diﬀerence?」Surely. If we take a pendulum ona universal joint, and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almostin a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but notin Quito. The blinds are down, too. The fact that this happened does not bringon the destruction of science. What is the fundamental hypothesis of science,the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the ﬁrst chapter: the sole test ofthe validity of any idea is experiment. If it turns out that most experiments workout the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those「most experiments」will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do notcome out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm.We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experiment, and we donot have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we are told thatthe same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well,but if when we try it, it does not, then it does not. We just have to take what wesee, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience.Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot gointo details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, becausethese are rather diﬃcult to understand. We shall assume that they are there, andgo on to describe what some of the consequences are. One of the consequences isthat things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, andparticles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There isno distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics uniﬁes theidea of the ﬁeld and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true thatwhen the frequency is low, the ﬁeld aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, ormore useful as an approximate description in terms of everyday experiences. Butas the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become moreevident with the equipment with which we usually make the measurements. Infact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly involvinga frequency has yet been detected above approximately 1012 cycles per second.We only deduce the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rulewhich assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid.Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new kindof particle to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron. That new particleis called a photon. The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that

2-11

is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, iscalled quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction oflight and matter, or electric ﬁeld and charges, is our greatest success so far inphysics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomenaexcept for gravitation and nuclear processes. For example, out of quantumelectrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: thelaws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic ﬁelds,the speciﬁc heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt,and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequencesof this one law. All these details can be worked out if the situation is simpleenough for us to make an approximation, which is almost never, but often we canunderstand more or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptionsare found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there wedo not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know whatis going on in the nucleus.

In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry,and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physicsbecause chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved inchemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynam-ics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things. In the ﬁrst place, it tells theproperties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted anothervery remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle ofthe same mass, but of opposite charge, called a positron, and these two, comingtogether, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays.(After all, light and gamma rays are all the same, they are just diﬀerent pointson a frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle there is anantiparticle, turns out to be true. In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has an-other name—it is called a positron, but for most other particles, it is called anti-so-and-so, like antiproton or antineutron. In quantum electrodynamics, two numbersare put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out.The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the chargeof the electron. Actually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbersfor chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads us to the next part.

2-4 Nuclei and particlesWhat are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is foundthat the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released,

2-12

the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the sameratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course,the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosionof TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms.The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons togetherin the nucleus? Just as the electrical interaction can be connected to a particle,a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons alsohave a ﬁeld of some kind, and that when this ﬁeld jiggles it behaves like aparticle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides protonsand neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles fromthe already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For example, he predictedthey should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and loand behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass! Butit later turned out to be the wrong particle. It was called a µ-meson, or muon.However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was found, theπ-meson, or pion, which satisﬁed Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the proton andthe neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion. Now,you say,「Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics usingthe pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything willbe explained.」Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are involved inthis theory are so diﬃcult that no one has ever been able to ﬁgure out what theconsequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this hasbeen going on now for almost twenty years!

So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right orwrong, but we do know that it is a little wrong, or at least incomplete. While wehave been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences ofthis theory, the experimentalists have been discovering some things. For example,they had already discovered this µ-meson or muon, and we do not yet know whereit ﬁts. Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other「extra」particles were found.It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is verydiﬃcult to understand the relationships of all these particles, and what naturewants them for, or what the connections are from one to another. We do nottoday understand these various particles as diﬀerent aspects of the same thing,and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a representation ofthe fact that we have so much unconnected information without a good theory.After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amountof knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience

2-13

and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeingwhat will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from. Asidefrom that, we have made very little progress. We have collected an enormousnumber of chemical elements. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared arelationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embodiedin the periodic table of Mendeleev. For example, sodium and potassium areabout the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same columnin the Mendeleev chart. We have been seeking a Mendeleev-type chart for thenew particles. One such chart of the new particles was made independently byGell-Mann in the U.S.A. and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classiﬁcationis a new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each particle,called its「strangeness,」S. This number is conserved, like the electric charge, inreactions which take place by nuclear forces.In Table 2-2 are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss them much at thisstage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know. Underneatheach particle its mass is given in a certain unit, called the MeV. One MeV isequal to 1.783 × 10−27 gram. The reason this unit was chosen is historical, andwe shall not go into it now. More massive particles are put higher up on thechart; we see that a neutron and a proton have almost the same mass. In verticalcolumns we have put the particles with the same electrical charge, all neutralobjects in one column, all positively charged ones to the right of this one, and allnegatively charged objects to the left.

Particles are shown with a solid line and「resonances」with a dashed one.Several particles have been omitted from the table. These include the importantzero-mass, zero-charge particles, the photon and the graviton, which do not fallinto the baryon-meson-lepton classiﬁcation scheme, and also some of the newerresonances (K∗, φ, η). The antiparticles of the mesons are listed in the table, butthe antiparticles of the leptons and baryons would have to be listed in anothertable which would look exactly like this one reﬂected on the zero-charge column.Although all of the particles except the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, andproton are unstable, decay products have been shown only for the resonances.Strangeness assignments are not applicable for leptons, since they do not interactstrongly with nuclei.

All particles which are together with the neutrons and protons are calledbaryons, and the following ones exist: There is a「lambda,」with a mass of1115 MeV, and three others, called sigmas, minus, neutral, and plus, with severalmasses almost the same. There are groups or multiplets with almost the same

mass, within one or two percent. Each particle in a multiplet has the samestrangeness. The ﬁrst multiplet is the proton-neutron doublet, and then there isa singlet (the lambda) then the sigma triplet, and ﬁnally the xi doublet. Veryrecently, in 1961, even a few more particles were found. Or are they particles?They live so short a time, they disintegrate almost instantaneously, as soon asthey are formed, that we do not know whether they should be considered as newparticles, or some kind of「resonance」interaction of a certain deﬁnite energybetween the Λ and π products into which they disintegrate.In addition to the baryons the other particles which are involved in the nuclearinteraction are called mesons. There are ﬁrst the pions, which come in threevarieties, positive, negative, and neutral; they form another multiplet. We havealso found some new things called K-mesons, and they occur as a doublet, K+and K0. Also, every particle has its antiparticle, unless a particle is its ownantiparticle. For example, the π− and the π+ are antiparticles, but the π0 isits own antiparticle. The K− and K+ are antiparticles, and the K0 and K0.In addition, in 1961 we also found some more mesons or maybe mesons whichdisintegrate almost immediately. A thing called ω which goes into three pionshas a mass 780 on this scale, and somewhat less certain is an object whichdisintegrates into two pions. These particles, called mesons and baryons, andthe antiparticles of the mesons are on the same chart, but the antiparticles ofthe baryons must be put on another chart,「reﬂected」through the charge-zerocolumn.

Just as Mendeleev’s chart was very good, except for the fact that there werea number of rare earth elements which were hanging out loose from it, so we havea number of things hanging out loose from this chart—particles which do notinteract strongly in nuclei, have nothing to do with a nuclear interaction, and donot have a strong interaction (I mean the powerful kind of interaction of nuclearenergy). These are called leptons, and they are the following: there is the electron,which has a very small mass on this scale, only 0.510 MeV. Then there is thatother, the µ-meson, the muon, which has a mass much higher, 206 times as heavyas an electron. So far as we can tell, by all experiments so far, the diﬀerencebetween the electron and the muon is nothing but the mass. Everything worksexactly the same for the muon as for the electron, except that one is heavier thanthe other. Why is there another one heavier; what is the use for it? We do notknow. In addition, there is a lepton which is neutral, called a neutrino, and thisparticle has zero mass. In fact, it is now known that there are two diﬀerent kindsof neutrinos, one related to electrons and the other related to muons.

Finally, we have two other particles which do not interact strongly with thenuclear ones: one is a photon, and perhaps, if the ﬁeld of gravity also has aquantum-mechanical analog (a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet beenworked out), then there will be a particle, a graviton, which will have zero mass.What is this「zero mass」? The masses given here are the masses of theparticles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that itcannot be at rest. A photon is never at rest, it is always moving at 186,000 milesa second. We will understand more what mass means when we understand thetheory of relativity, which will come in due time.

Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together seemto be the fundamental constituents of matter. Fortunately, these particles arenot all diﬀerent in their interactions with one another. In fact, there seem to bejust four kinds of interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasingstrength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction,and gravity. The photon is coupled to all charged particles and the strength of theinteraction is measured by some number, which is 1/137. The detailed law of thiscoupling is known, that is quantum electrodynamics. Gravity is coupled to allenergy, but its coupling is extremely weak, much weaker than that of electricity.This law is also known. Then there are the so-called weak decays—beta decay,which causes the neutron to disintegrate into proton, electron, and neutrino,relatively slowly. This law is only partly known. The so-called strong interaction,the meson-baryon interaction, has a strength of 1 in this scale, and the law iscompletely unknown, although there are a number of known rules, such as thatthe number of baryons does not change in any reaction.

This then, is the horrible condition of our physics today. To summarize it,I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to know all; inside it, quantummechanics is valid—the principles of quantum mechanics have not been found tofail. The stage on which we put all of our knowledge, we would say, is relativisticspace-time; perhaps gravity is involved in space-time. We do not know how theuniverse got started, and we have never made experiments which check our ideasof space and time accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only know that ourideas work above that distance. We should also add that the rules of the gameare the quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply, so far as wecan tell, to the new particles as well as to the old. The origin of the forces innuclei leads us to new particles, but unfortunately they appear in great profusionand we lack a complete understanding of their interrelationship, although wealready know that there are some very surprising relationships among them. Weseem gradually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of subatomicparticles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go in this task.
