The Kinetic Theory of Gases

39-1 Properties of matterWith this chapter we begin a new subject which will occupy us for sometime. It is the ﬁrst part of the analysis of the properties of matter from thephysical point of view, in which, recognizing that matter is made out of a greatmany atoms, or elementary parts, which interact electrically and obey the lawsof mechanics, we try to understand why various aggregates of atoms behave theway they do.

It is obvious that this is a diﬃcult subject, and we emphasize at the beginningthat it is in fact an extremely diﬃcult subject, and that we have to deal withit diﬀerently than we have dealt with the other subjects so far. In the case ofmechanics and in the case of light, we were able to begin with a precise statementof some laws, like Newton’s laws, or the formula for the ﬁeld produced by anaccelerating charge, from which a whole host of phenomena could be essentiallyunderstood, and which would produce a basis for our understanding of mechanicsand of light from that time on. That is, we may learn more later, but we do notlearn diﬀerent physics, we only learn better methods of mathematical analysis todeal with the situation.

We cannot use this approach eﬀectively in studying the properties of matter.We can discuss matter only in a most elementary way; it is much too complicateda subject to analyze directly from its speciﬁc basic laws, which are none otherthan the laws of mechanics and electricity. But these are a bit too far away fromthe properties we wish to study; it takes too many steps to get from Newton’s lawsto the properties of matter, and these steps are, in themselves, fairly complicated.We will now start to take some of these steps, but while many of our analyseswill be quite accurate, they will eventually get less and less accurate. We willhave only a rough understanding of the properties of matter.

39-1

One of the reasons that we have to perform the analysis so imperfectly is thatthe mathematics of it requires a deep understanding of the theory of probability;we are not going to want to know where every atom is actually moving, butrather, how many move here and there on the average, and what the odds are fordiﬀerent eﬀects. So this subject involves a knowledge of the theory of probability,and our mathematics is not yet quite ready and we do not want to strain it toohard.

Secondly, and more important from a physical standpoint, the actual behaviorof the atoms is not according to classical mechanics, but according to quantummechanics, and a correct understanding of the subject cannot be attained untilwe understand quantum mechanics. Here, unlike the case of billiard balls andautomobiles, the diﬀerence between the classical mechanical laws and the quantum-mechanical laws is very important and very signiﬁcant, so that many things thatwe will deduce by classical physics will be fundamentally incorrect. Thereforethere will be certain things to be partially unlearned; however, we shall indicate inevery case when a result is incorrect, so that we will know just where the「edges」are. One of the reasons for discussing quantum mechanics in the precedingchapters was to give an idea as to why, more or less, classical mechanics isincorrect in the various directions.

Why do we deal with the subject now at all? Why not wait half a year, or ayear, until we know the mathematics of probability better, and we learn a littlequantum mechanics, and then we can do it in a more fundamental way? Theanswer is that it is a diﬃcult subject, and the best way to learn is to do it slowly!The ﬁrst thing to do is to get some idea, more or less, of what ought to happenin diﬀerent circumstances, and then, later, when we know the laws better, wewill formulate them better.

Anyone who wants to analyze the properties of matter in a real problemmight want to start by writing down the fundamental equations and then tryto solve them mathematically. Although there are people who try to use suchan approach, these people are the failures in this ﬁeld; the real successes cometo those who start from a physical point of view, people who have a rough ideawhere they are going and then begin by making the right kind of approximations,knowing what is big and what is small in a given complicated situation. Theseproblems are so complicated that even an elementary understanding, althoughinaccurate and incomplete, is worthwhile having, and so the subject will be onethat we shall go over again and again, each time with more and more accuracy,as we go through our course in physics.

39-2

Another reason for beginning the subject right now is that we have alreadyused many of these ideas in, for example, chemistry, and we have even heard ofsome of them in high school. It is interesting to know the physical basis for thesethings.

As an interesting example, we all know that equal volumes of gases, at thesame pressure and temperature, contain the same number of molecules. Thelaw of multiple proportions, that when two gases combine in a chemical reactionthe volumes needed always stand in simple integral proportions, was understoodultimately by Avogadro to mean that equal volumes have equal numbers of atoms.Now why do they have equal numbers of atoms? Can we deduce from Newton’slaws that the number of atoms should be equal? We shall address ourselves tothat speciﬁc matter in this chapter. In succeeding chapters, we shall discussvarious other phenomena involving pressures, volumes, temperature, and heat.We shall also ﬁnd that the subject can be attacked from a nonatomic point ofview, and that there are many interrelationships of the properties of substances.For instance, when we compress something, it heats; if we heat it, it expands.There is a relationship between these two facts which can be deduced indepen-dently of the machinery underneath. This subject is called thermodynamics. Thedeepest understanding of thermodynamics comes, of course, from understandingthe actual machinery underneath, and that is what we shall do: we shall takethe atomic viewpoint from the beginning and use it to understand the variousproperties of matter and the laws of thermodynamics.

Let us, then, discuss the properties of gases from the standpoint of Newton’s

laws of mechanics.

39-2 The pressure of a gasFirst, we know that a gas exerts a pressure, and we must clearly understandwhat this is due to. If our ears were a few times more sensitive, we would heara perpetual rushing noise. Evolution has not developed the ear to that point,because it would be useless if it were so much more sensitive—we would heara perpetual racket. The reason is that the eardrum is in contact with the air,and air is a lot of molecules in perpetual motion and these bang against theeardrums. In banging against the eardrums they make an irregular tattoo—boom,boom, boom—which we do not hear because the atoms are so small, and thesensitivity of the ear is not quite enough to notice it. The result of this perpetualbombardment is to push the drum away, but of course there is an equal perpetual

39-3

bombardment of atoms on the other side of the eardrum, so the net force on itis zero. If we were to take the air away from one side, or change the relativeamounts of air on the two sides, the eardrum would then be pushed one way orthe other, because the amount of bombardment on one side would be greaterthan on the other. We sometimes feel this uncomfortable eﬀect when we go uptoo fast in an elevator or an airplane, especially if we also have a bad cold (whenwe have a cold, inﬂammation closes the tube which connects the air on the insideof the eardrum with the outside air through the throat, so that the two pressurescannot readily equalize).

Fig. 39-1. Atoms of a gas in a box with a frictionless piston.

In considering how to analyze the situation quantitatively, we imagine thatwe have a volume of gas in a box, at one end of which is a piston which can bemoved (Fig. 39-1). We would like to ﬁnd out what force on the piston resultsfrom the fact that there are atoms in this box. The volume of the box is V ,and as the atoms move around inside the box with various velocities they bangagainst the piston. Suppose there is nothing, a vacuum, on the outside of thepiston. What of it? If the piston were left alone, and nobody held onto it, eachtime it got banged it would pick up a little momentum and it would graduallyget pushed out of the box. So in order to keep it from being pushed out of thebox, we have to hold it with a force F. The problem is, how much force? Oneway of expressing the force is to talk about the force per unit area: if A is thearea of the piston, then the force on the piston will be written as a number timesthe area. We deﬁne the pressure, then, as equal to the force that we have toapply on a piston, divided by the area of the piston:

P = F/A.

(39.1)To make sure we understand the idea (we have to derive it for another purposeanyway), the diﬀerential work dW done on the gas in compressing it by movingthe piston in a diﬀerential amount −dx would be the force times the distancethat we compress it, which, according to (39.1), would be the pressure times the

39-4

area, times the distance, which is equal to minus the pressure times the changein the volume:

dW = F(−dx) = −P A dx = −P dV.

(39.2)(The area A times the distance dx is the volume change.) The minus sign is therebecause, as we compress it, we decrease the volume; if we think about it we cansee that if a gas is compressed, work is done on it.

How much force do we have to apply to balance the banging of the molecules?The piston receives from each collision a certain amount of momentum. A certainamount of momentum per second will pour into the piston, and it will start to move.To keep it from moving, we must pour back into it the same amount of momentumper second from our force. Of course, the force is the amount of momentum persecond that we must pour in. There is another way to put it: if we let go of thepiston it will pick up speed because of the bombardments; with each collisionwe get a little more speed, and the speed thus accelerates. The rate at which thepiston picks up speed, or accelerates, is proportional to the force on it. So we seethat the force, which we already have said is the pressure times the area, is equalto the momentum per second delivered to the piston by the colliding molecules.To calculate the momentum per second is easy—we can do it in two parts:ﬁrst, we ﬁnd the momentum delivered to the piston by one particular atom in acollision with the piston, then we have to multiply by the number of collisionsper second that the atoms have with the wall. The force will be the product ofthese two factors. Now let us see what the two factors are: In the ﬁrst place,we shall suppose that the piston is a perfect「reﬂector」for the atoms. If it isnot, the whole theory is wrong, and the piston will start to heat up and thingswill change, but eventually, when equilibrium has set in, the net result is thatthe collisions are eﬀectively perfectly elastic. On the average, every particle thatcomes in leaves with the same energy. So we shall imagine that the gas is ina steady condition, and we lose no energy to the piston because the piston isstanding still. In those circumstances, if a particle comes in with a certain speed,it comes out with the same speed and, we will say, with the same mass.

If v is the velocity of an atom, and vx is the x-component of v, then mvx isthe x-component of momentum「in」; but we also have an equal component ofmomentum「out,」and so the total momentum delivered to the piston by theparticle, in one collision, is 2mvx, because it is「reﬂected.」Now, we need the number of collisions made by the atoms in a second, or ina certain amount of time dt; then we divide by dt. How many atoms are hitting?

39-5

Let us suppose that there are N atoms in the volume V , or n = N/V in each unitvolume. To ﬁnd how many atoms hit the piston, we note that, given a certainamount of time t, if a particle has a certain velocity toward the piston it willhit during the time t, provided it is close enough. If it is too far away, it goesonly part way toward the piston in the time t, but does not reach the piston.Therefore it is clear that only those molecules which are within a distance vxtfrom the piston are going to hit the piston in the time t. Thus the number ofcollisions in a time t is equal to the number of atoms which are in the regionwithin a distance vxt, and since the area of the piston is A, the volume occupiedby the atoms which are going to hit the piston is vxtA. But the number of atomsthat are going to hit the piston is that volume times the number of atoms perunit volume, nvxtA. Of course we do not want the number that hit in a time t,we want the number that hit per second, so we divide by the time t, to get nvxA.(This time t could be made very short; if we feel we want to be more elegant, wecall it dt, then diﬀerentiate, but it is the same thing.)

So we ﬁnd that the force is

(39.3)See, the force is proportional to the area, if we keep the particle density ﬁxed aswe change the area! The pressure is then

F = nvxA · 2mvx.

P = 2nmv2x.

(39.4)

Now we notice a little trouble with this analysis: First, all the molecules donot have the same velocity, and they do not move in the same direction. So, allthe v2’s are diﬀerent! So what we must do, of course, is to take an average ofthe v2’s, since each one makes its own contribution. What we want is the squareof vx, averaged over all the molecules:

x

x

P = nmhv2xi.

(39.5)

Did we forget to include the factor 2? No; of all the atoms, only half are headedtoward the piston. The other half are headed the other way, so the number ofatoms per unit volume that are hitting the piston is only n/2.Now as the atoms bounce around, it is clear that there is nothing specialabout the「x-direction」; the atoms may also be moving up and down, back andforth, in and out. Therefore it is going to be true that hv2xi, the average motion

39-6

yi = hv2zi.

hv2xi = hv2

of the atoms in one direction, and the average in the other two directions, are allgoing to be equal:

(39.6)It is only a matter of rather tricky mathematics to notice, therefore, that theyare each equal to one-third of their sum, which is of course the square of themagnitude of the velocity:hv2xi = 1

(39.7)This has the advantage that we do not have to worry about any particulardirection, and so we write our pressure formula again in this form:

zi = hv2i/3.

3hv2

x

+ v2

y

+ v2

(39.8)The reason we wrote the last factor as hmv2/2i is that this is the kinetic energyof the center-of-mass motion of the molecule. We ﬁnd, therefore, that

3)nhmv2/2i.

P = ( 2

3)hmv2/2i.

(39.9)With this equation we can calculate how much the pressure is, if we know thespeeds.

P V = N( 2

As a very simple example let us take helium gas, or any other gas, like mercuryvapor, or potassium vapor of high enough temperature, or argon, in which all themolecules are single atoms, for which we may suppose that there is no internalmotion in the atom. If we had a complex molecule, there might be some internalmotion, mutual vibrations, or something. We suppose that we may disregardthat; this is actually a serious matter that we will have to come back to, but itturns out to be all right. We suppose that the internal motion of the atoms canbe disregarded, and therefore, for this purpose, that the kinetic energy of thecenter-of-mass motion is all the energy there is. So for a monatomic gas, thekinetic energy is the total energy. In general, we are going to call U the totalenergy (it is sometimes called the total internal energy—we may wonder why,since there is no external energy to a gas), i.e., all the energy of all the moleculesin the gas, or the object, whatever it is.For a monatomic gas we will suppose that the total energy U is equal toa number of atoms times the average kinetic energy of each, because we aredisregarding any possibility of excitation or motion inside the atoms themselves.Then, in these circumstances, we would have

P V = 2

3 U.

39-7

(39.10)

Incidentally, we can stop here and ﬁnd the answer to the following question:Suppose that we take a can of gas and compress the gas slowly, how much pressuredo we need to squeeze the volume down? It is easy to ﬁnd out, since the pressureis 23 the energy divided by V . As we squeeze it down, we do work on the gasand we thereby increase the energy U. So we are going to have some kind of adiﬀerential equation: If we start out in a given circumstance with a certain energyand a certain volume, we then know the pressure. Now we start to squeeze, butthe moment we do, the energy U increases and the volume V decreases, so thepressure goes up.So, we have to solve a diﬀerential equation, and we will solve it in a moment.We must ﬁrst emphasize, however, that as we are compressing this gas, we aresupposing that all the work goes into increasing the energy of the atoms inside.We may ask,「Isn’t that necessary? Where else could it go?」It turns out that itcan go another place. There are what we call「heat leaks」through the walls: thehot (i.e., fast-moving) atoms that bombard the walls, heat the walls, and energygoes away. We shall suppose for the present that this is not the case.

For somewhat wider generality, although we are still making some very special

assumptions about our gas, we shall write, not P V = 2

3 U, but

P V = (γ − 1)U.

3 for a monatomic gas like helium, because 5

(39.11)It is written (γ − 1) times U for conventional reasons, because we will deal with3, but willa few other cases later where the number in front of U will not be 2be a diﬀerent number. So, in order to do the thing in general, we call it γ − 1,because people have been calling it that for almost one hundred years. This γ,then, is 5We have already noticed that when we compress a gas the work done is −P dV .A compression in which there is no heat energy added or removed is called anadiabatic compression, from the Greek a (not) + dia (through) + bainein (togo). (The word adiabatic is used in physics in several ways, and it is sometimeshard to see what is common about them.) That is, for an adiabatic compressionall the work done goes into changing the internal energy. That is the key—thatthere are no other losses of energy—for then we have P dV = −dU. But sinceU = P V /(γ − 1), we may write

3 − 1 is 23.

(39.12)So we have P dV = −(P dV + V dP)/(γ −1), or, rearranging the terms, γP dV =

dU = (P dV + V dP)/(γ − 1).

39-8

−V dP, or

(39.13)Fortunately, assuming that γ is constant, as it is for a monatomic gas, wecan integrate this: it gives γ ln V + ln P = ln C, where ln C is the constant ofintegration. If we take the exponential of both sides, we get the law

(γ dV /V ) + (dP/P) = 0.

P V γ = C (a constant).

(39.14)In other words, under adiabatic conditions, where the temperature rises as wecompress because no heat is being lost, the pressure times the volume to the3 power is a constant for a monatomic gas! Although we derived it theoretically,5this is, in fact, the way monatomic gases behave experimentally.

39-3 Compressibility of radiationWe may give one other example of the kinetic theory of a gas, one whichis not used in chemistry so much, but is used in astronomy. We have a largenumber of photons in a box in which the temperature is very high. (The boxis, of course, the gas in a very hot star. The sun is not hot enough; there arestill too many atoms, but at still higher temperatures in certain very hot stars,we may neglect the atoms and suppose that the only objects that we have inthe box are photons.) Now then, a photon has a certain momentum p. (Wealways ﬁnd that we are in terrible trouble when we do kinetic theory: p is thepressure, but p is the momentum; v is the volume, but v is the velocity; T is thetemperature, but T is the kinetic energy or the time or the torque; one must keepone’s wits about one!) This p is momentum, it is a vector. Going through thesame analysis as before, it is the x-component of the vector p which generatesthe「kick,」and twice the x-component of the vector p is the momentum whichis given in the kick. Thus 2px replaces 2mvx, and in evaluating the number ofcollisions, vx is still vx, so when we get all the way through, we ﬁnd that thepressure in Eq. (39.4) is, instead,

(39.15)Then, in the averaging, it becomes n times the average of pxvx (the same factorof 2) and, ﬁnally, putting in the other two directions, we ﬁnd

P = 2npxvx.

P V = Nhp · vi/3.

39-9

(39.16)

3(p · v), averaged.

This checks with the formula (39.9), because the momentum is mv; it is a littlemore general, that is all. The pressure times the volume is the total number ofatoms times 1Now, for photons, what is p · v? The momentum and the velocity are in thesame direction, and the velocity is the speed of light, so this is the momentum ofeach of the objects, times the speed of light. The momentum times the speed oflight of every photon is its energy: E = pc, so these terms are the energies ofeach of the photons, and we should, of course, take an average energy, times thenumber of photons. So we have 1

3 of the energy inside the gas:

P V = U/3 (photon gas).

(39.17)3, or γ = 43,

For photons, then, since we have 1and we have discovered that radiation in a box obeys the law

3 in front, (γ − 1) in (39.11) is 1

P V 4/3 = C.

(39.18)

So we know the compressibility of radiation! That is what is used in an analysisof the contribution of radiation pressure in a star, that is how we calculate it,and how it changes when we compress it. What wonderful things are alreadywithin our power!

39-4 Temperature and kinetic energySo far we have not dealt with temperature; we have purposely been avoidingthe temperature. As we compress a gas, we know that the energy of the moleculesincreases, and we are used to saying that the gas gets hotter; we would liketo understand what this has to do with the temperature. If we try to do theexperiment, not adiabatically but at what we call constant temperature, what arewe doing? We know that if we take two boxes of gas and let them sit next toeach other long enough, even if at the start they were at what we call diﬀerenttemperatures, they will in the end come to the same temperature. Now whatdoes that mean? That means that they get to a condition that they would getto if we left them alone long enough! What we mean by equal temperature isjust that—the ﬁnal condition when things have been sitting around interactingwith each other long enough.

Let us consider, now, what happens if we have two gases in containersseparated by a movable piston as in Fig. 39-2 (just for simplicity we shall take

39-10

Fig. 39-2. Atoms of two diﬀerent monatomic gases are separated by

a movable piston.

two monatomic gases, say helium and neon). In container (1) the atoms havemass m1, velocity v1, and there are n1 per unit volume, and in the other containerthe atoms have mass m2, velocity v2, there are n2 atoms per unit volume. Whatare the conditions for equilibrium?Obviously, the bombardment from the left side must be such that it movesthe piston to the right and compresses the other gas until its pressure builds up,and the thing will thus slosh back and forth, and will gradually come to rest at aplace where the pressures are equal on both sides. So we can arrange that thepressures are equal; that just means that the internal energies per unit volume areequal, or that the numbers n times the average kinetic energies on each side areequal. What we have to try to prove, eventually, is that the numbers themselvesare equal. So far, all we know is that the numbers times the kinetic energies areequal,

n1hm1v2

1/2i = n2hm2v2

2/2i,

from (39.8), because the pressures are equal. We must realize that this is not theonly condition over the long run, but something else must happen more slowlyas the true complete equilibrium corresponding to equal temperatures sets in.To see the idea, suppose that the pressure on the left side were developed byhaving a very high density but a low velocity. By having a large n and a small v,we can get the same pressure as by having a small n and a large v. The atomsmay be moving slowly but be packed nearly solidly, or there may be fewer butthey are hitting harder. Will it stay like that forever? At ﬁrst we might think so,but then we think again and ﬁnd we have forgotten one important point. That is,that the intermediate piston does not receive a steady pressure; it wiggles, justlike the eardrum that we were ﬁrst talking about, because the hangings are notabsolutely uniform. There is not a perpetual, steady pressure, but a tattoo—thepressure varies, and so the thing jiggles. Suppose that the atoms on the rightside are not jiggling much, but those on the left are few and far between and veryenergetic. The piston will, now and then, get a big impulse from the left, and will

39-11

Fig. 39-3. A collision between unequal atoms, viewed in the CM

system. u1 = |v1 − vCM|, u2 = |v2 − vCM|.

be driven against the slow atoms on the right, giving them more speed. (As eachatom collides with the piston, it either gains or loses energy, depending uponwhether the piston is moving one way or the other when the atom strikes it.) So,as a result of the collisions, the piston ﬁnds itself jiggling, jiggling, jiggling, andthis shakes the other gas—it gives energy to the other atoms, and they build upfaster motions, until they balance the jiggling that the piston is giving to them.The system comes to some equilibrium where the piston is moving at such amean square speed that it picks up energy from the atoms at about the samerate as it puts energy back into them. So the piston picks up a certain meanirregularity in speed, and it is our problem to ﬁnd it. When we do ﬁnd it, we cansolve our problem better, because the gases will adjust their velocities until therate at which they are trying to pour energy into each other through the pistonwill become equal.

It is quite diﬃcult to ﬁgure out the details of the piston in this particularcircumstance; although it is ideally simple to understand, it turns out to be alittle harder to analyze. Before we analyze that, let us analyze another problemin which we have a box of gas but now we have two diﬀerent kinds of moleculesin it, having masses m1 and m2, velocities v1 and v2, and so forth; there is nowa much more intimate relationship. If all of the No. 2 molecules are standingstill, that condition is not going to last, because they get kicked by the No. 1molecules and so pick up speed. If they are all going much faster than the No. 1molecules, then maybe that will not last either—they will pass the energy backto the No. 1 molecules. So when both gases are in the same box, the problem isto ﬁnd the rule that determines the relative speeds of the two.

This is still a very diﬃcult problem, but we will solve it as follows. First weconsider the following sub-problem (again this is one of those cases where—nevermind the derivation—in the end the result is very simple to remember, but the

39-12

derivation is just ingenious). Let us suppose that we have two molecules, ofdiﬀerent mass, colliding, and that the collision is viewed in the center-of-mass(CM) system. In order to remove a complication, we look at the collision in theCM. As we know from the laws of collision, by the conservation of momentumand energy, after the molecules collide the only way they can move is such thateach maintains its own original speed—and they just change their direction. Sowe have an average collision that looks like that in Fig. 39-3. Suppose, for amoment, that we watch all the collisions with the CM at rest. Suppose weimagine that they are all initially moving horizontally. Of course, after the ﬁrstcollision some of them are moving at an angle. In other words, if they were allgoing horizontally, then at least some would later be moving vertically. Now insome other collision, they would be coming in from another direction, and thenthey would be twisted at still another angle. So even if they were completelyorganized in the beginning, they would get sprayed around at all angles, andthen the sprayed ones would get sprayed some more, and sprayed some more,and sprayed some more. Ultimately, what will be the distribution? Answer: Itwill be equally likely to ﬁnd any pair moving in any direction in space. After thatfurther collisions could not change the distribution.They are equally likely to go in all directions, but how do we say that? Thereis of course no likelihood that they will go in any speciﬁc direction, because aspeciﬁc direction is too exact, so we have to talk about per unit「something.」The idea is that any area on a sphere centered at a collision point will have justas many molecules going through it as go through any other equal area on thesphere. So the result of the collisions will be to distribute the directions so thatequal areas on a sphere will have equal probabilities.

Incidentally, if we just want to discuss the original direction and some otherdirection an angle θ from it, it is an interesting property that the diﬀerentialarea of a sphere of unit radius is sin θ dθ times 2π (see Fig. 32-1). And sin θ dθis the same as the diﬀerential of − cos θ. So what it means is that the cosine ofthe angle θ between any two directions is equally likely to be anything from −1to +1.Next, we have to worry about the actual case, where we do not have thecollision in the CM system, but we have two atoms which are coming togetherwith vector velocities v1 and v2. What happens now? We can analyze thiscollision with the vector velocities v1 and v2 in the following way: We ﬁrst saythat there is a certain CM; the velocity of the CM is given by the「average」velocity, with weights proportional to the masses, so the velocity of the CM

39-13

If we watch this collision in the CMis vCM = (m1v1 + m2v2)/(m1 + m2).system, then we see a collision just like that in Fig. 39-3, with a certain relativevelocity w coming in. The relative velocity is just v1 − v2. Now the idea is that,ﬁrst, the whole CM is moving, and in the CM there is a relative velocity w, andthe molecules collide and come oﬀ in some new direction. All this happens whilethe CM keeps right on moving, without any change.

Now then, what is the distribution resulting from this? From our previousargument we conclude this: that at equilibrium, all directions for w are equallylikely, relative to the direction of the motion of the CM.* There will be noparticular correlation, in the end, between the direction of the motion of therelative velocity and that of the motion of the CM. Of course, if there were, thecollisions would spray it about, so it is all sprayed around. So the cosine of theangle between w and vCM is zero on the average. That is,

hw · vCMi = 0.

(39.19)

But w · vCM can be expressed in terms of v1 and v2 as well:

w · vCM = (v1 − v2) · (m1v1 + m2v2)

m1 + m2

.

= (m1v2

1 − m2v2

2) + (m2 − m1)(v1 · v2)m1 + m2

(39.20)First, let us look at the v1 · v2; what is the average of v1 · v2? That is, whatis the average of the component of velocity of one molecule in the direction ofanother? Surely there is just as much likelihood of ﬁnding any given moleculemoving one way as another. The average of the velocity v2 in any direction iszero. Certainly, then, in the direction of v1, v2 has zero average. So, the averageof v1 · v2 is zero! Therefore, we conclude that the average of m1v21 must be equal2. That is, the average kinetic energy of the two must beto the average of m2v2equal:(39.21)If we have two kinds of atoms in a gas, it can be shown, and we presume to haveshown it, that the average of the kinetic energy of one is the same as the average

* This argument, which was the one used by Maxwell, involves some subtleties. Althoughthe conclusion is correct, the result does not follow purely from the considerations of symmetrythat we used before, since, by going to a reference frame moving through the gas, we may ﬁnda distorted velocity distribution. We have not found a simple proof of this result.

of the kinetic energy of the other, when they are both in the same gas in thesame box in equilibrium. That means that the heavy ones will move slower thanthe light ones; this is easily shown by experimentation with「atoms」of diﬀerentmasses in an air trough.

Now we would like to go one step further, and say that if we have two diﬀerentgases separated in a box, they will also have equal average kinetic energy whenthey have ﬁnally come to equilibrium, even though they are not in the same box.We can make the argument in a number of ways. One way is to argue that ifwe have a ﬁxed partition with a tiny hole in it (Fig. 39-4) so that one gas couldleak out through the holes while the other could not, because the molecules aretoo big, and these had attained equilibrium, then we know that in one part,where they are mixed, they have the same average kinetic energy, but some comethrough the hole without loss of kinetic energy, so the average kinetic energy inthe pure gas and in the mixture must be the same. That is not too satisfactory,because maybe there are no holes, for this kind of molecule, that separate onekind from the other.

Let us now go back to the piston problem. We can give an argument whichshows that the kinetic energy of this piston must also be 12. Actually, thatwould be the kinetic energy due to the purely horizontal motion of the piston,so, forgetting its up and down motion, it will have to be the same as 1.2 m2v22xLikewise, from the equilibrium on the other side, we can prove that the kineticenergy of the piston is 1. Although this is not in the middle of the gas,but is on one side of the gas, we can still make the argument, although it is alittle more diﬃcult, that the average kinetic energy of the piston and of the gasmolecules are equal as a result of all the collisions.

If this still does not satisfy us, we may make an artiﬁcial example by whichthe equilibrium is generated by an object which can be hit on all sides. Supposethat we have a short rod with a ball on each end sticking through the piston, ona frictionless sliding universal joint. Each ball is round, like one of the molecules,and can be hit on all sides. This whole object has a certain total mass, m. Now,

we have the gas molecules with mass m1 and mass m2 as before. The result ofthe collisions, by the analysis that was made before, is that the kinetic energyof m because of collisions with the molecules on one side must be 11, onthe average. Likewise, because of the collisions with molecules on the other side,it has to be 12 on the average. So, therefore, both sides have to have thesame kinetic energy when they are in thermal equilibrium. So, although we onlyproved it for a mixture of gases, it is easily extended to the case where there aretwo diﬀerent, separate gases at the same temperature.

Thus when we have two gases at the same temperature, the mean kineticenergy of the CM motions are equal.The mean molecular kinetic energy is a property only of the「temperature.」Being a property of the「temperature,」and not of the gas, we can use it as adeﬁnition of the temperature. The mean kinetic energy of a molecule is thussome function of the temperature. But who is to tell us what scale to use forthe temperature? We may arbitrarily deﬁne the scale of temperature so thatthe mean energy is linearly proportional to the temperature. The best way todo it would be to call the mean energy itself「the temperature.」That wouldbe the simplest possible function. Unfortunately, the scale of temperature hasbeen chosen diﬀerently, so instead of calling it temperature directly we use aconstant conversion factor between the energy of a molecule and a degree ofabsolute temperature called a degree Kelvin. The constant of proportionality isk = 1.38 × 10−23 joule for every degree Kelvin.* So if T is absolute temperature,our deﬁnition says that the mean molecular kinetic energy is 32 is putin as a matter of convenience, so as to get rid of it somewhere else.)We point out that the kinetic energy associated with the component of motion2 kT. The three independent directions that

(39.9) andso ﬁnd the law for the pressure of gases as a function of the temperature: it isthat the pressure times the volume is equal to the total number of atoms timesthe universal constant k, times the temperature:

Furthermore, at the same temperature and pressure and volume, the number ofatoms is determined; it too is a universal constant! So equal volumes of diﬀerentgases, at the same pressure and temperature, have the same number of molecules,because of Newton’s laws. That is an amazing conclusion!

In practice, when dealing with molecules, because the numbers are so large,the chemists have artiﬁcially chosen a speciﬁc number, a very large number, andcalled it something else. They have a number which they call a mole. A mole ismerely a handy number. Why they did not choose 1024 objects, so it would comeout even, is a historical question. They happened to choose, for the convenientnumber of objects on which they standardize, N0 = 6.02 × 1023 objects, and thisis called a mole of objects. So instead of measuring the number of molecules inunits, they measure in terms of numbers of moles.* In terms of N0 we can writethe number of moles, times the number of atoms in a mole, times kT, and if wewant to, we can take the number of atoms in a mole times k, which is a mole’sworth of k, and call it something else, and we do—we call it R. A mole’s worthof k is 8.317 joules: R = N0k = 8.317 J · mole−1 · ◦K−1. Thus we also ﬁnd thegas law written as the number of moles (also called N) times RT, or the numberof atoms, times kT:(39.23)It is the same thing, just a diﬀerent scale for measuring numbers. We use 1 as aunit, and chemists use 6 × 1023 as a unit!We now make one more remark about our gas law, and that has to do withthe law for objects other than monatomic molecules. We have dealt only with theCM motion of the atoms of a monatomic gas. What happens if there are forcespresent? First, consider the case that the piston is held by a horizontal spring,and there are forces on it. The exchange of jiggling motion between atoms andpiston at any moment does not depend on where the piston is at that moment,of course. The equilibrium conditions are the same. No matter where the pistonis, its speed of motion must be such that it passes energy to the molecules in justthe right way. So it makes no diﬀerence about the spring. The speed at whichthe piston has to move, on the average, is the same. So our theorem, that themean value of the kinetic energy in one direction is 12 kT, is true whether thereare forces present or not.

P V = N RT.

* What the chemists call molecular weights are the masses in grams of a mole of a molecule.The mole is deﬁned so that the mass of a mole of carbon atoms of isotope 12 (i.e., having6 protons and 6 neutrons in the nucleus) is exactly 12 grams.

Consider, for example, a diatomic molecule composed of atoms mA and mB.What we have proved is that the motion of the CM of part A and that of part Bare such that h 12 kT. How can this be, if they are heldtogether? Although they are held together, when they are spinning and turningin there, when something hits them, exchanging energy with them, the onlything that counts is how fast they are moving. That alone determines how fastthey exchange energy in collisions. At the particular instant, the force is not anessential point. Therefore the same principle is right, even when there are forces.Let us prove, ﬁnally, that the gas law is consistent also with a disregard ofthe internal motion. We did not really include the internal motions before; wejust treated a monatomic gas. But we shall now show that an entire object,considered as a single body of total mass M, has a velocity of the CM such that

In other words, we can consider either the separate pieces or the whole thing! Letus see the reason for that: The mass of the diatomic molecule is M = mA + mB,and the velocity of the center of mass is equal to vCM = (mAvA + mBvB)/M.Now we need hv2

(We have used the fact that (mA + mB)/M = 1.) Now what is hvA · vBi? (Ithad better be zero!) To ﬁnd out, let us use our assumption that the relativevelocity, w = vA − vB is not any more likely to point in one direction than inanother—that is, that its average component in any direction is zero. Thus weassume that

hw · vCMi = 0.

Thus if mA 6= mB, we ﬁnd that hvA · vBi = 0, and therefore that the bodilymotion of the entire molecule, regarded as a single particle of mass M, has akinetic energy, on the average, equal to 3Incidentally, we have also proved at the same time that the average kineticenergy of the internal motions of the diatomic molecule, disregarding the bodilymotion of the CM, is 32 kT! For, the total kinetic energy of the parts of the2 kT, or 3kT. The kineticmolecule is 12 mBv2energy of the center-of-mass motion is 32 kT, so the average kinetic energy of therotational and vibratory motions of the two atoms inside the molecule is thediﬀerence, 3

The theorem concerning the average energy of the CM motion is general: forany object considered as a whole, with forces present or no, for every independentdirection of motion that there is, the average kinetic energy in that motion is 12 kT.These「independent directions of motion」are sometimes called the degrees offreedom of the system. The number of degrees of freedom of a molecule composedof r atoms is 3r, since each atom needs three coordinates to deﬁne its position.The entire kinetic energy of the molecule can be expressed either as the sum ofthe kinetic energies of the separate atoms, or as the sum of the kinetic energy ofthe CM motion plus the kinetic energy of the internal motions. The latter cansometimes be expressed as a sum of rotational kinetic energy of the molecule andvibrational energy, but this is an approximation. Our theorem, applied to ther-atom molecule, says that the molecule will have, on the average, 3rkT /2 joulesof kinetic energy, of which 32 kT is kinetic energy of the center-of-mass motion of2(r−1)kT, is internal vibrational and rotationalthe entire molecule, and the rest, 3kinetic energy.
