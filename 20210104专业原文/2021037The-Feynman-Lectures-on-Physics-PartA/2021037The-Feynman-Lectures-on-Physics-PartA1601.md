Relativistic Energy and Momentum

16-1 Relativity and the philosophersIn this chapter we shall continue to discuss the principle of relativity ofEinstein and Poincaré, as it aﬀects our ideas of physics and other branches ofhuman thought.

Poincaré made the following statement of the principle of relativity:「Ac-cording to the principle of relativity, the laws of physical phenomena must bethe same for a ﬁxed observer as for an observer who has a uniform motion oftranslation relative to him, so that we have not, nor can we possibly have, anymeans of discerning whether or not we are carried along in such a motion.」

When this idea descended upon the world, it caused a great stir amongphilosophers, particularly the「cocktail-party philosophers,」who say,「Oh, it isvery simple: Einstein’s theory says all is relative!」In fact, a surprisingly largenumber of philosophers, not only those found at cocktail parties (but rather thanembarrass them, we shall just call them「cocktail-party philosophers」), will say,「That all is relative is a consequence of Einstein, and it has profound inﬂuenceson our ideas.」In addition, they say「It has been demonstrated in physics thatphenomena depend upon your frame of reference.」We hear that a great deal,but it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd out what it means. Probably the frames of referencethat were originally referred to were the coordinate systems which we use in theanalysis of the theory of relativity. So the fact that「things depend upon yourframe of reference」is supposed to have had a profound eﬀect on modern thought.One might well wonder why, because, after all, that things depend upon one’spoint of view is so simple an idea that it certainly cannot have been necessary togo to all the trouble of the physical relativity theory in order to discover it. Thatwhat one sees depends upon his frame of reference is certainly known to anybodywho walks around, because he sees an approaching pedestrian ﬁrst from thefront and then from the back; there is nothing deeper in most of the philosophy

16-1

which is said to have come from the theory of relativity than the remark that「Aperson looks diﬀerent from the front than from the back.」The old story aboutthe elephant that several blind men describe in diﬀerent ways is another example,perhaps, of the theory of relativity from the philosopher’s point of view.

But certainly there must be deeper things in the theory of relativity thanjust this simple remark that「A person looks diﬀerent from the front than fromthe back.」Of course relativity is deeper than this, because we can make deﬁnitepredictions with it. It certainly would be rather remarkable if we could predictthe behavior of nature from such a simple observation alone.There is another school of philosophers who feel very uncomfortable about thetheory of relativity, which asserts that we cannot determine our absolute velocitywithout looking at something outside, and who would say,「It is obvious thatone cannot measure his velocity without looking outside. It is self-evident that itis meaningless to talk about the velocity of a thing without looking outside; thephysicists are rather stupid for having thought otherwise, but it has just dawned onthem that this is the case. If only we philosophers had realized what the problemswere that the physicists had, we could have decided immediately by brainworkthat it is impossible to tell how fast one is moving without looking outside, andwe could have made an enormous contribution to physics.」These philosophersare always with us, struggling in the periphery to try to tell us something, butthey never really understand the subtleties and depths of the problem.

Our inability to detect absolute motion is a result of experiment and not aresult of plain thought, as we can easily illustrate. In the ﬁrst place, Newtonbelieved that it was true that one could not tell how fast he is going if he ismoving with uniform velocity in a straight line. In fact, Newton ﬁrst statedthe principle of relativity, and one quotation made in the last chapter was astatement of Newton’s. Why then did the philosophers not make all this fussabout「all is relative,」or whatever, in Newton’s time? Because it was not untilMaxwell’s theory of electrodynamics was developed that there were physical lawsthat suggested that one could measure his velocity without looking outside; soonit was found experimentally that one could not.Now, is it absolutely, deﬁnitely, philosophically necessary that one shouldnot be able to tell how fast he is moving without looking outside? One of theconsequences of relativity was the development of a philosophy which said,「Youcan only deﬁne what you can measure! Since it is self-evident that one cannotmeasure a velocity without seeing what he is measuring it relative to, thereforeit is clear that there is no meaning to absolute velocity. The physicists should

16-2

have realized that they can talk only about what they can measure.」But thatis the whole problem: whether or not one can deﬁne absolute velocity is thesame as the problem of whether or not one can detect in an experiment, withoutlooking outside, whether he is moving. In other words, whether or not a thingis measurable is not something to be decided a priori by thought alone, butsomething that can be decided only by experiment. Given the fact that thevelocity of light is 186,000 mi/sec, one will ﬁnd few philosophers who will calmlystate that it is self-evident that if light goes 186,000 mi/sec inside a car, andthe car is going 100,000 mi/sec, that the light also goes 186,000 mi/sec past anobserver on the ground. That is a shocking fact to them; the very ones who claimit is obvious ﬁnd, when you give them a speciﬁc fact, that it is not obvious.

Finally, there is even a philosophy which says that one cannot detect anymotion except by looking outside. It is simply not true in physics. True, onecannot perceive a uniform motion in a straight line, but if the whole room wererotating we would certainly know it, for everybody would be thrown to the wall—there would be all kinds of「centrifugal」eﬀects. That the earth is turning on itsaxis can be determined without looking at the stars, by means of the so-calledFoucault pendulum, for example. Therefore it is not true that「all is relative」; itis only uniform velocity that cannot be detected without looking outside. Uniformrotation about a ﬁxed axis can be. When this is told to a philosopher, he is veryupset that he did not really understand it, because to him it seems impossiblethat one should be able to determine rotation about an axis without lookingoutside. If the philosopher is good enough, after some time he may come backand say,「I understand. We really do not have such a thing as absolute rotation;we are really rotating relative to the stars, you see. And so some inﬂuence exertedby the stars on the object must cause the centrifugal force.」Now, for all we know, that is true; we have no way, at the present time, oftelling whether there would have been centrifugal force if there were no stars andnebulae around. We have not been able to do the experiment of removing all thenebulae and then measuring our rotation, so we simply do not know. We mustadmit that the philosopher may be right. He comes back, therefore, in delight andsays,「It is absolutely necessary that the world ultimately turn out to be this way:absolute rotation means nothing; it is only relative to the nebulae.」Then we say tohim,「Now, my friend, is it or is it not obvious that uniform velocity in a straightline, relative to the nebulae should produce no eﬀects inside a car?」Now that themotion is no longer absolute, but is a motion relative to the nebulae, it becomesa mysterious question, and a question that can be answered only by experiment.

16-3

What, then, are the philosophic inﬂuences of the theory of relativity? If welimit ourselves to inﬂuences in the sense of what kind of new ideas and suggestionsare made to the physicist by the principle of relativity, we could describe some ofthem as follows. The ﬁrst discovery is, essentially, that even those ideas whichhave been held for a very long time and which have been very accurately veriﬁedmight be wrong. It was a shocking discovery, of course, that Newton’s laws arewrong, after all the years in which they seemed to be accurate. Of course it isclear, not that the experiments were wrong, but that they were done over only alimited range of velocities, so small that the relativistic eﬀects would not havebeen evident. But nevertheless, we now have a much more humble point of viewof our physical laws—everything can be wrong!Secondly, if we have a set of「strange」ideas, such as that time goes slowerwhen one moves, and so forth, whether we like them or do not like them is anirrelevant question. The only relevant question is whether the ideas are consistentwith what is found experimentally. In other words, the「strange ideas」need onlyagree with experiment, and the only reason that we have to discuss the behaviorof clocks and so forth is to demonstrate that although the notion of the timedilation is strange, it is consistent with the way we measure time.Finally, there is a third suggestion which is a little more technical but whichhas turned out to be of enormous utility in our study of other physical laws,and that is to look at the symmetry of the laws or, more speciﬁcally, to look forthe ways in which the laws can be transformed and leave their form the same.When we discussed the theory of vectors, we noted that the fundamental lawsof motion are not changed when we rotate the coordinate system, and now welearn that they are not changed when we change the space and time variables ina particular way, given by the Lorentz transformation. So this idea of studyingthe patterns or operations under which the fundamental laws are not changedhas proved to be a very useful one.

16-2 The twin paradoxTo continue our discussion of the Lorentz transformation and relativisticeﬀects, we consider a famous so-called「paradox」of Peter and Paul, who aresupposed to be twins, born at the same time. When they are old enough todrive a space ship, Paul ﬂies away at very high speed. Because Peter, who is lefton the ground, sees Paul going so fast, all of Paul’s clocks appear to go slower,his heart beats go slower, his thoughts go slower, everything goes slower, from

16-4

Peter’s point of view. Of course, Paul notices nothing unusual, but if he travelsaround and about for a while and then comes back, he will be younger than Peter,the man on the ground! That is actually right; it is one of the consequencesof the theory of relativity which has been clearly demonstrated. Just as themu-mesons last longer when they are moving, so also will Paul last longer whenhe is moving. This is called a「paradox」only by the people who believe that theprinciple of relativity means that all motion is relative; they say,「Heh, heh, heh,from the point of view of Paul, can’t we say that Peter was moving and shouldtherefore appear to age more slowly? By symmetry, the only possible result isthat both should be the same age when they meet.」But in order for them tocome back together and make the comparison, Paul must either stop at the endof the trip and make a comparison of clocks or, more simply, he has to comeback, and the one who comes back must be the man who was moving, and heknows this, because he had to turn around. When he turned around, all kinds ofunusual things happened in his space ship—the rockets went oﬀ, things jammedup against one wall, and so on—while Peter felt nothing.

So the way to state the rule is to say that the man who has felt the accelerations,who has seen things fall against the walls, and so on, is the one who would bethe younger; that is the diﬀerence between them in an「absolute」sense, and itis certainly correct. When we discussed the fact that moving mu-mesons livelonger, we used as an example their straight-line motion in the atmosphere. Butwe can also make mu-mesons in a laboratory and cause them to go in a curvewith a magnet, and even under this accelerated motion, they last exactly as muchlonger as they do when they are moving in a straight line. Although no one hasarranged an experiment explicitly so that we can get rid of the paradox, onecould compare a mu-meson which is left standing with one that had gone arounda complete circle, and it would surely be found that the one that went aroundthe circle lasted longer. Although we have not actually carried out an experimentusing a complete circle, it is really not necessary, of course, because everythingﬁts together all right. This may not satisfy those who insist that every single factbe demonstrated directly, but we conﬁdently predict the result of the experimentin which Paul goes in a complete circle.

16-3 Transformation of velocitiesThe main diﬀerence between the relativity of Einstein and the relativity ofNewton is that the laws of transformation connecting the coordinates and times

16-5

between relatively moving systems are diﬀerent. The correct transformation law,that of Lorentz, is

These equations correspond to the relatively simple case in which the relativemotion of the two observers is along their common x-axes. Of course otherdirections of motion are possible, but the most general Lorentz transformation israther complicated, with all four quantities mixed up together. We shall continueto use this simpler form, since it contains all the essential features of relativity.Let us now discuss more of the consequences of this transformation. First, itis interesting to solve these equations in reverse. That is, here is a set of linearequations, four equations with four unknowns, and they can be solved in reverse,for x, y, z, t in terms of x0, y0, z0, t0. The result is very interesting, since it tells ushow a system of coordinates「at rest」looks from the point of view of one that is「moving.」Of course, since the motions are relative and of uniform velocity, theman who is「moving」can say, if he wishes, that it is really the other fellow whois moving and he himself who is at rest. And since he is moving in the oppositedirection, he should get the same transformation, but with the opposite sign ofvelocity. That is precisely what we ﬁnd by manipulation, so that is consistent. Ifit did not come out that way, we would have real cause to worry!

(16.1)

(16.2)

Next we discuss the interesting problem of the addition of velocities in relativity.We recall that one of the original puzzles was that light travels at 186,000 mi/secin all systems, even when they are in relative motion. This is a special case of

16-6

the more general problem exempliﬁed by the following. Suppose that an objectinside a space ship is going at 100,000 mi/sec and the space ship itself is going at100,000 mi/sec; how fast is the object inside the space ship moving from the pointof view of an observer outside? We might want to say 200,000 mi/sec, which isfaster than the speed of light. This is very unnerving, because it is not supposedto be going faster than the speed of light! The general problem is as follows.

Let us suppose that the object inside the ship, from the point of view ofthe man inside, is moving with velocity v, and that the space ship itself has avelocity u with respect to the ground. We want to know with what velocity vxthis object is moving from the point of view of the man on the ground. This is,of course, still but a special case in which the motion is in the x-direction. Therewill also be a transformation for velocities in the y-direction, or for any angle;these can be worked out as needed. Inside the space ship the velocity is vx0,which means that the displacement x0 is equal to the velocity times the time:

x0 = vx0t0.

(16.3)

Now we have only to calculate what the position and time are from the point ofview of the outside observer for an object which has the relation (16.2) betweenx0 and t0. So we simply substitute (16.3) into (16.2), and obtain

p1 − u2/c2 .x = vx0t0 + ut0

(16.4)

(16.5)

(16.6)

But here we ﬁnd x expressed in terms of t0. In order to get the velocity as seenby the man on the outside, we must divide his distance by his time, not by theother man’s time! So we must also calculate the time as seen from the outside,which is

p1 − u2/c2t = t0 + u(vx0t0)/c2Now we must ﬁnd the ratio of x to t, which is= u + vx0

.

vx = xt

1 + uvx0/c2 ,

the square roots having cancelled. This is the law that we seek: the resultantvelocity, the「summing」of two velocities, is not just the algebraic sum of two

16-7

velocities (we know that it cannot be or we get in trouble), but is「corrected」by 1 + uv/c2.

Now let us see what happens. Suppose that you are moving inside the spaceship at half the speed of light, and that the space ship itself is going at half the2 c and v is 1speed of light. Thus u is 12 c, but in the denominator uv is one-fourth,so that2 c + 112 c1 + 14

= 4c5 .

v =

So, in relativity,「half」and「half」does not make「one,」it makes only「4/5.」Ofcourse low velocities can be added quite easily in the familiar way, because solong as the velocities are small compared with the speed of light we can forgetabout the (1 + uv/c2) factor; but things are quite diﬀerent and quite interestingat high velocity.

Let us take a limiting case. Just for fun, suppose that inside the space shipthe man was observing light itself. In other words, v = c, and yet the space shipis moving. How will it look to the man on the ground? The answer will be

v = u + c1 + uc/c2

= c

u + cu + c

= c.

Therefore, if something is moving at the speed of light inside the ship, it willappear to be moving at the speed of light from the point of view of the manon the ground too! This is good, for it is, in fact, what the Einstein theory ofrelativity was designed to do in the ﬁrst place—so it had better work!

Of course, there are cases in which the motion is not in the direction of theuniform translation. For example, there may be an object inside the ship whichis just moving「upward」with the velocity vy0 with respect to the ship, and theship is moving「horizontally.」Now, we simply go through the same thing, onlyusing y’s instead of x’s, with the result

so that if vx0 = 0,

Thus a sidewise velocity is no longer vy0, but vy0p1 − u2/c2. We found this

result by substituting and combining the transformation equations, but we can

vy = yt

(16.7)

y = y0 = vy0t0,

= vy0p1 − u2/c2.

light by the factorp1 − u2/c2 (see Eq. 15.3). But now suppose that we let a

also see the result directly from the principle of relativity for the following reason(it is always good to look again to see whether we can see the reason). We havealready (Fig. 15-3) seen how a possible clock might work when it is moving; thelight appears to travel at an angle at the speed c in the ﬁxed system, while itsimply goes vertically with the same speed in the moving system. We found thatthe vertical component of the velocity in the ﬁxed system is less than that ofmaterial particle go back and forth in this same「clock,」but at some integralfraction 1/n of the speed of light (Fig. 16-1). Then when the particle has goneback and forth once, the light will have gone exactly n times. That is, each「click」of the「particle」clock will coincide with each nth「click」of the light clock. Thisfact must still be true when the whole system is moving, because the physicalphenomenon of coincidence will be a coincidence in any frame. Therefore, sincethe speed cy is less than the speed of light, the speed vy of the particle must beslower than the corresponding speed by the same square-root ratio! That is whythe square root appears in any vertical velocity.

16-4 Relativistic massWe learned in the last chapter that the mass of an object increases withvelocity, but no demonstration of this was given, in the sense that we made noarguments analogous to those about the way clocks have to behave. However,we can show that, as a consequence of relativity plus a few other reasonableassumptions, the mass must vary in this way. (We have to say「a few otherassumptions」because we cannot prove anything unless we have some laws which

16-9

we assume to be true, if we expect to make meaningful deductions.) To avoidthe need to study the transformation laws of force, we shall analyze a collision,where we need know nothing about the laws of force, except that we shall assumethe conservation of momentum and energy. Also, we shall assume that themomentum of a particle which is moving is a vector and is always directed in thedirection of the velocity. However, we shall not assume that the momentum is aconstant times the velocity, as Newton did, but only that it is some function ofvelocity. We thus write the momentum vector as a certain coeﬃcient times thevector velocity:

p = mvv.

(16.8)We put a subscript v on the coeﬃcient to remind us that it is a function ofvelocity, and we shall agree to call this coeﬃcient mv the「mass.」Of course,when the velocity is small, it is the same mass that we would measure in theslow-moving experiments that we are used to. Now we shall try to demonstrate

that the formula for mv must be m0/p1 − v2/c2, by arguing from the principle

of relativity that the laws of physics must be the same in every coordinate system.

Fig. 16-2. Two views of an elastic collision between equal objects

moving at the same speed in opposite directions.

Suppose that we have two particles, like two protons, that are absolutely equal,and they are moving toward each other with exactly equal velocities. Their totalmomentum is zero. Now what can happen? After the collision, their directionsof motion must be exactly opposite to each other, because if they are not exactlyopposite, there will be a nonzero total vector momentum, and momentum wouldnot have been conserved. Also they must have the same speeds, since they areexactly similar objects; in fact, they must have the same speed they started with,since we suppose that the energy is conserved in these collisions. So the diagramof an elastic collision, a reversible collision, will look like Fig. 16-2(a): all thearrows are the same length, all the speeds are equal. We shall suppose that such

16-10

collisions can always be arranged, that any angle θ can occur, and that any speedcould be used in such a collision. Next, we notice that this same collision can beviewed diﬀerently by turning the axes, and just for convenience we shall turnthe axes, so that the horizontal splits it evenly, as in Fig. 16-2(b). It is the samecollision redrawn, only with the axes turned.

Fig. 16-3. Two more views of the collision, from moving cars.

Now here is the real trick: let us look at this collision from the point of view ofsomeone riding along in a car that is moving with a speed equal to the horizontalcomponent of the velocity of one particle. Then how does the collision look?It looks as though particle 1 is just going straight up, because it has lost itshorizontal component, and it comes straight down again, also because it doesnot have that component. That is, the collision appears as shown in Fig. 16-3(a).Particle 2, however, was going the other way, and as we ride past it appears toﬂy by at some terriﬁc speed and at a smaller angle, but we can appreciate thatthe angles before and after the collision are the same. Let us denote by u thehorizontal component of the velocity of particle 2, and by w the vertical velocityof particle 1.Now the question is, what is the vertical velocity u tan α? If we knew that, wecould get the correct expression for the momentum, using the law of conservationof momentum in the vertical direction. Clearly, the horizontal component of themomentum is conserved: it is the same before and after the collision for bothparticles, and is zero for particle 1. So we need use the conservation law onlyfor the upward velocity u tan α. But we can get the upward velocity, simply bylooking at the same collision going the other way! If we look at the collision ofFig. 16-3(a) from a car moving to the left with speed u, we see the same collision,except「turned over,」as shown in Fig. 16-3(b). Now particle 2 is the one that goesup and down with speed w, and particle 1 has picked up the horizontal speed u.

16-11

it is wp1 − u2/c2 (see

Of course, now we know what the velocity u tan α is:Eq. 16.7). We know that the change in the vertical momentum of the verticallymoving particle is

∆p = 2mww

(2, because it moves up and back down). The obliquely moving particle has a

certain velocity v whose components we have found to be u and wp1 − u2/c2,therefore ∆p0 = 2mvwp1 − u2/c2 because, in accordance with our assumed

and whose mass is mv. The change in vertical momentum of this particle islaw (16.8), the momentum component is always the mass corresponding to themagnitude of the velocity times the component of the velocity in the direction ofinterest. Thus in order for the total momentum to be zero the vertical momentamust cancel and the ratio of the mass moving with speed v and the mass movingwith speed w must therefore be

Let us take the limiting case that w is inﬁnitesimal. If w is very tiny indeed, itis clear that v and u are practically equal. In this case, mw → m0 and mv → mu.The grand result is

It is an interesting exercise now to check whether or not Eq. (16.9) is indeed truefor arbitrary values of w, assuming that Eq. (16.10) is the right formula for themass. Note that the velocity v needed in Eq. (16.9) can be calculated from theright-angle triangle:

v2 = u2 + w2(1 − u2/c2).

It will be found to check out automatically, although we used it only in the limitof small w.

Now, let us accept that momentum is conserved and that the mass dependsupon the velocity according to (16.10) and go on to ﬁnd what else we can conclude.Let us consider what is commonly called an inelastic collision. For simplicity, weshall suppose that two objects of the same kind, moving oppositely with equalspeeds w, hit each other and stick together, to become some new, stationaryobject, as shown in Fig. 16-4(a). The mass m of each corresponds to w, which, as

we know, is m0/p1 − w2/c2. If we assume the conservation of momentum and

objects.

the principle of relativity, we can demonstrate an interesting fact about the massof the new object which has been formed. We imagine an inﬁnitesimal velocity uat right angles to w (we can do the same with ﬁnite values of u, but it is easier tounderstand with an inﬁnitesimal velocity), then look at this same collision as weride by in an elevator at the velocity −u. What we see is shown in Fig. 16-4(b).The composite object has an unknown mass M. Now object 1 moves with anupward component of velocity u and a horizontal component which is practicallyequal to w, and so also does object 2. After the collision we have the mass Mmoving upward with velocity u, considered very small compared with the speedof light, and also small compared with w. Momentum must be conserved, so letus estimate the momentum in the upward direction before and after the collision.Before the collision we have p ≈ 2mwu, and after the collision the momentum isevidently p0 = Muu, but Mu is essentially the same as M0 because u is so small.These momenta must be equal because of the conservation of momentum, andtherefore

M0 = 2mw.

(16.11)The mass of the object which is formed when two equal objects collide must betwice the mass of the objects which come together. You might say,「Yes, of course,that is the conservation of mass.」But not「Yes, of course,」so easily, becausethese masses have been enhanced over the masses that they would be if they werestanding still, yet they still contribute, to the total M, not the mass they havewhen standing still, but more. Astonishing as that may seem, in order for theconservation of momentum to work when two objects come together, the massthat they form must be greater than the rest masses of the objects, even thoughthe objects are at rest after the collision!

16-5 Relativistic energyIn the last chapter we demonstrated that as a result of the dependence ofthe mass on velocity and Newton’s laws, the changes in the kinetic energy of an

16-13

object resulting from the total work done by the forces on it always comes out tobe

p1 − u2/c2 − m0c2.

m0c2

∆T = (mu − m0)c2 =

(16.12)

We even went further, and guessed that the total energy is the total mass times c2.Now we continue this discussion.

Suppose that our two equally massive objects that collide can still be「seen」inside M. For instance, a proton and a neutron are「stuck together,」but are stillmoving about inside of M. Then, although we might at ﬁrst expect the mass M tobe 2m0, we have found that it is not 2m0, but 2mw. Since 2mw is what is put in,but 2m0 are the rest masses of the things inside, the excess mass of the compositeobject is equal to the kinetic energy brought in. This means, of course, that energyhas inertia. In the last chapter we discussed the heating of a gas, and showed thatbecause the gas molecules are moving and moving things are heavier, when we putenergy into the gas its molecules move faster and so the gas gets heavier. But infact the argument is completely general, and our discussion of the inelastic collisionshows that the mass is there whether or not it is kinetic energy. In other words, iftwo particles come together and produce potential or any other form of energy; ifthe pieces are slowed down by climbing hills, doing work against internal forces, orwhatever; then it is still true that the mass is the total energy that has been put in.So we see that the conservation of mass which we have deduced above is equivalentto the conservation of energy, and therefore there is no place in the theory ofrelativity for strictly inelastic collisions, as there was in Newtonian mechanics.According to Newtonian mechanics it is all right for two things to collide and soform an object of mass 2m0 which is in no way distinct from the one that wouldresult from putting them together slowly. Of course we know from the law ofconservation of energy that there is more kinetic energy inside, but that does notaﬀect the mass, according to Newton’s laws. But now we see that this is impossible;because of the kinetic energy involved in the collision, the resulting object willbe heavier; therefore, it will be a diﬀerent object. When we put the objectstogether gently they make something whose mass is 2m0; when we put themtogether forcefully, they make something whose mass is greater. When the mass isdiﬀerent, we can tell that it is diﬀerent. So, necessarily, the conservation of energymust go along with the conservation of momentum in the theory of relativity.

This has interesting consequences. For example, suppose that we have anobject whose mass M is measured, and suppose something happens so that it ﬂies

16-14

into two equal pieces moving with speed w, so that they each have a mass mw.Now suppose that these pieces encounter enough material to slow them up untilthey stop; then they will have mass m0. How much energy will they have givento the material when they have stopped? Each will give an amount (mw − m0)c2,by the theorem that we proved before. This much energy is left in the materialin some form, as heat, potential energy, or whatever. Now 2mw = M, so theliberated energy is E = (M − 2m0)c2. This equation was used to estimate howmuch energy would be liberated under ﬁssion in the atomic bomb, for example.(Although the fragments are not exactly equal, they are nearly equal.) The massof the uranium atom was known—it had been measured ahead of time—and theatoms into which it split, iodine, xenon, and so on, all were of known mass. Bymasses, we do not mean the masses while the atoms are moving, we mean themasses when the atoms are at rest. In other words, both M and m0 are known.So by subtracting the two numbers one can calculate how much energy will bereleased if M can be made to split in「half.」For this reason poor old Einsteinwas called the「father」of the atomic bomb in all the newspapers. Of course, allthat meant was that he could tell us ahead of time how much energy would bereleased if we told him what process would occur. The energy that should beliberated when an atom of uranium undergoes ﬁssion was estimated about sixmonths before the ﬁrst direct test, and as soon as the energy was in fact liberated,someone measured it directly (and if Einstein’s formula had not worked, theywould have measured it anyway), and the moment they measured it they nolonger needed the formula. Of course, we should not belittle Einstein, but rathershould criticize the newspapers and many popular descriptions of what causeswhat in the history of physics and technology. The problem of how to get thething to occur in an eﬀective and rapid manner is a completely diﬀerent matter.The result is just as signiﬁcant in chemistry. For instance, if we were to weighthe carbon dioxide molecule and compare its mass with that of the carbon andthe oxygen, we could ﬁnd out how much energy would be liberated when carbonand oxygen form carbon dioxide. The only trouble here is that the diﬀerences inmasses are so small that it is technically very diﬃcult to do.

Now let us turn to the question of whether we should add m0c2 to the kineticenergy and say from now on that the total energy of an object is mc2. First, if wecan still see the component pieces of rest mass m0 inside M, then we could saythat some of the mass M of the compound object is the mechanical rest mass ofthe parts, part of it is kinetic energy of the parts, and part of it is potential energyof the parts. But we have discovered, in nature, particles of various kinds which

undergo reactions just like the one we have treated above, in which with all thestudy in the world, we cannot see the parts inside. For instance, when a K-mesondisintegrates into two pions it does so according to the law (16.11), but the ideathat a K is made out of 2 π’s is a useless idea, because it also disintegrates into3 π’s!Therefore we have a new idea: we do not have to know what things are madeof inside; we cannot and need not identify, inside a particle, which of the energy isrest energy of the parts into which it is going to disintegrate. It is not convenientand often not possible to separate the total mc2 energy of an object into restenergy of the inside pieces, kinetic energy of the pieces, and potential energy ofthe pieces; instead, we simply speak of the total energy of the particle. We「shiftthe origin」of energy by adding a constant m0c2 to everything, and say that thetotal energy of a particle is the mass in motion times c2, and when the object isstanding still, the energy is the mass at rest times c2.Finally, we ﬁnd that the velocity v, momentum P, and total energy E arerelated in a rather simple way. That the mass in motion at speed v is the mass m0following relations are easily proved, and turn out to be very useful:

at rest divided byp1 − v2/c2, surprisingly enough, is rarely used. Instead, the
