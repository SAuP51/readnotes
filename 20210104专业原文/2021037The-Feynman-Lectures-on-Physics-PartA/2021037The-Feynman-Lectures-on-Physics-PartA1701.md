Space-Time

17-1 The geometry of space-timeThe theory of relativity shows us that the relationships of positions andtimes as measured in one coordinate system and another are not what we wouldhave expected on the basis of our intuitive ideas. It is very important that wethoroughly understand the relations of space and time implied by the Lorentztransformation, and therefore we shall consider this matter more deeply in thischapter.

The Lorentz transformation between the positions and times (x, y, z, t) asmeasured by an observer「standing still,」and the corresponding coordinates andtime (x0, y0, z0, t0) measured inside a「moving」space ship, moving with velocity uare

(17.1)

x − ut

p1 − u2/c2 ,x0 =y0 = y,z0 = z,p1 − u2/c2 .t0 = t − ux/c2

Let us compare these equations with Eq. (11.5), which also relates measurementsin two systems, one of which in this instance is rotated relative to the other:

x0 = x cos θ + y sin θ,y0 = y cos θ − x sin θ,z0 = z .

(17.2)

In this particular case, Moe and Joe are measuring with axes having an angle θbetween the x0- and x-axes. In each case, we note that the「primed」quantities

17-1

are「mixtures」of the「unprimed」ones: the new x0 is a mixture of x and y, andthe new y0 is also a mixture of x and y.An analogy is useful: When we look at an object, there is an obvious thing wemight call the「apparent width,」and another we might call the「depth.」But thetwo ideas, width and depth, are not fundamental properties of the object, becauseif we step aside and look at the same thing from a diﬀerent angle, we get a diﬀerentwidth and a diﬀerent depth, and we may develop some formulas for computing thenew ones from the old ones and the angles involved. Equations (17.2) are theseformulas. One might say that a given depth is a kind of「mixture」of all depthand all width. If it were impossible ever to move, and we always saw a givenobject from the same position, then this whole business would be irrelevant—wewould always see the「true」width and the「true」depth, and they would appearto have quite diﬀerent qualities, because one appears as a subtended optical angleand the other involves some focusing of the eyes or even intuition; they wouldseem to be very diﬀerent things and would never get mixed up. It is because wecan walk around that we realize that depth and width are, somehow or other,just two diﬀerent aspects of the same thing.Can we not look at the Lorentz transformations in the same way? Here alsowe have a mixture—of positions and the time. A diﬀerence between a spacemeasurement and a time measurement produces a new space measurement. Inother words, in the space measurements of one man there is mixed in a little bitof the time, as seen by the other. Our analogy permits us to generate this idea:The「reality」of an object that we are looking at is somehow greater (speakingcrudely and intuitively) than its「width」and its「depth」because they dependupon how we look at it; when we move to a new position, our brain immediatelyrecalculates the width and the depth. But our brain does not immediatelyrecalculate coordinates and time when we move at high speed, because we havehad no eﬀective experience of going nearly as fast as light to appreciate thefact that time and space are also of the same nature. It is as though we werealways stuck in the position of having to look at just the width of something,not being able to move our heads appreciably one way or the other; if we could,we understand now, we would see some of the other man’s time—we would see「behind,」so to speak, a little bit.

Thus we shall try to think of objects in a new kind of world, of space and timemixed together, in the same sense that the objects in our ordinary space-world arereal, and can be looked at from diﬀerent directions. We shall then consider thatobjects occupying space and lasting for a certain length of time occupy a kind of

a「blob」in a new kind of world, and that we look at this「blob」from diﬀerentpoints of view when we are moving at diﬀerent velocities. This new world, thisgeometrical entity in which the「blobs」exist by occupying position and takingup a certain amount of time, is called space-time. A given point (x, y, z, t) inspace-time is called an event. Imagine, for example, that we plot the x-positionshorizontally, y and z in two other directions, both mutually at「right angles」andat「right angles」to the paper (!), and time, vertically. Now, how does a movingparticle, say, look on such a diagram? If the particle is standing still, then it hasa certain x, and as time goes on, it has the same x, the same x, the same x; soits「path」is a line that runs parallel to the t-axis (Fig. 17-1 a). On the otherhand, if it drifts outward, then as the time goes on x increases (Fig. 17-1 b).So a particle, for example, which starts to drift out and then slows up shouldhave a motion something like that shown in Fig. 17-1(c). A particle, in otherwords, which is permanent and does not disintegrate is represented by a line inspace-time. A particle which disintegrates would be represented by a forked line,because it would turn into two other things which would start from that point.What about light? Light travels at the speed c, and that would be represented

by a line having a certain ﬁxed slope (Fig. 17-1 d).

Now according to our new idea, if a given event occurs to a particle, say ifit suddenly disintegrates at a certain space-time point into two new ones whichfollow some new tracks, and this interesting event occurred at a certain valueof x and a certain value of t, then we would expect that, if this makes any sense,we just have to take a new pair of axes and turn them, and that will give us thenew t and the new x in our new system, as shown in Fig. 17-2(a). But this iswrong, because Eq. (17.1) is not exactly the same mathematical transformation

17-3

as Eq. (17.2). Note, for example, the diﬀerence in sign between the two, and thefact that one is written in terms of cos θ and sin θ, while the other is written withalgebraic quantities. (Of course, it is not impossible that the algebraic quantitiescould be written as cosine and sine, but actually they cannot.) But still, the twoexpressions are very similar. As we shall see, it is not really possible to thinkof space-time as a real, ordinary geometry because of that diﬀerence in sign. Infact, although we shall not emphasize this point, it turns out that a man who ismoving has to use a set of axes which are inclined equally to the light ray, usinga special kind of projection parallel to the x0- and t0-axes, for his x0 and t0, asshown in Fig. 17-2(b). We shall not deal with the geometry, since it does nothelp much; it is easier to work with the equations.

17-2 Space-time intervalsAlthough the geometry of space-time is not Euclidean in the ordinary sense,there is a geometry which is very similar, but peculiar in certain respects. Ifthis idea of geometry is right, there ought to be some functions of coordinatesand time which are independent of the coordinate system. For example, underordinary rotations, if we take two points, one at the origin, for simplicity, andthe other one somewhere else, both systems would have the same origin, andthe distance from here to the other point is the same in both. That is oneproperty that is independent of the particular way of measuring it. The squareof the distance is x2 + y2 + z2. Now what about space-time? It is not hard todemonstrate that we have here, also, something which stays the same, namely, thecombination c2t2 − x2 − y2 − z2 is the same before and after the transformation:(17.3)This quantity is therefore something which, like the distance, is「real」in somesense; it is called the interval between the two space-time points, one of which is,

c2t02 − x02 − y02 − z02 = c2t2 − x2 − y2 − z2.

17-4

in this case, at the origin. (Actually, of course, it is the interval squared, justas x2 + y2 + z2 is the distance squared.) We give it a diﬀerent name because itis in a diﬀerent geometry, but the interesting thing is only that some signs arereversed and there is a c in it.

Let us get rid of the c; that is an absurdity if we are going to have a wonderfulspace with x’s and y’s that can be interchanged. One of the confusions that couldbe caused by someone with no experience would be to measure widths, say, by theangle subtended at the eye, and measure depth in a diﬀerent way, like the strainon the muscles needed to focus them, so that the depths would be measured infeet and the widths in meters. Then one would get an enormously complicatedmess of equations in making transformations such as (17.2), and would not beable to see the clarity and simplicity of the thing for a very simple technicalreason, that the same thing is being measured in two diﬀerent units. Now in Eqs.(17.1) and (17.3) nature is telling us that time and space are equivalent; timebecomes space; they should be measured in the same units. What distance is a「second」? It is easy to ﬁgure out from (17.3) what it is. It is 3 × 108 meters, thedistance that light would go in one second. In other words, if we were to measureall distances and times in the same units, seconds, then our unit of distancewould be 3 × 108 meters, and the equations would be simpler. Or another waythat we could make the units equal is to measure time in meters. What is ameter of time? A meter of time is the time it takes for light to go one meter,and is therefore 1/3 × 10−8 sec, or 3.3 billionths of a second! We would like, inother words, to put all our equations in a system of units in which c = 1. If timeand space are measured in the same units, as suggested, then the equations areobviously much simpliﬁed. They are

x0 = x − ut√1 − u2 ,y0 = y,z0 = z,t0 = t − ux√1 − u2 .

t02 − x02 − y02 − z02 = t2 − x2 − y2 − z2.

(17.4)

(17.5)

If we are ever unsure or「frightened」that after we have this system with c = 1we shall never be able to get our equations right again, the answer is quite the

17-5

opposite. It is much easier to remember them without the c’s in them, and it isalways easy to put the c’s back, by looking after the dimensions. For instance,in √1 − u2, we know that we cannot subtract a velocity squared, which has units,from the pure number 1, so we know that we must divide u2 by c2 in order tomake that unitless, and that is the way it goes.The diﬀerence between space-time and ordinary space, and the character of aninterval as related to the distance, is very interesting. According to formula (17.5),if we consider a point which in a given coordinate system had zero time, andonly space, then the interval squared would be negative and we would have animaginary interval, the square root of a negative number. Intervals can be eitherreal or imaginary in the theory. The square of an interval may be either positiveor negative, unlike distance, which has a positive square. When an interval isimaginary, we say that the two points have a space-like interval between them(instead of imaginary), because the interval is more like space than like time. Onthe other hand, if two objects are at the same place in a given coordinate system,but diﬀer only in time, then the square of the time is positive and the distancesare zero and the interval squared is positive; this is called a time-like interval. Inour diagram of space-time, therefore, we would have a representation somethinglike this: at 45◦ there are two lines (actually, in four dimensions these will be「cones,」called light cones and points on these lines are all at zero interval fromthe origin. Where light goes from a given point is always separated from it by azero interval, as we see from Eq. (17.5). Incidentally, we have just proved thatif light travels with speed c in one system, it travels with speed c in another,for if the interval is the same in both systems, i.e., zero in one and zero in theother, then to state that the propagation speed of light is invariant is the sameas saying that the interval is zero.

17-3 Past, present, and futureThe space-time region surrounding a given space-time point can be separatedinto three regions, as shown in Fig. 17-3.In one region we have space-likeintervals, and in two regions, time-like intervals. Physically, these three regionsinto which space-time around a given point is divided have an interesting physicalrelationship to that point: a physical object or a signal can get from a point inregion 2 to the event O by moving along at a speed less than the speed of light.Therefore events in this region can aﬀect the point O, can have an inﬂuenceon it from the past. In fact, of course, an object at P on the negative t-axis is

17-6

Fig. 17-3. The space-time region surrounding a point at the origin.

precisely in the「past」with respect to O; it is the same space-point as O, onlyearlier. What happened there then, aﬀects O now. (Unfortunately, that is theway life is.) Another object at Q can get to O by moving with a certain speedless than c, so if this object were in a space ship and moving, it would be, again,the past of the same space-point. That is, in another coordinate system, the axisof time might go through both O and Q. So all points of region 2 are in the「past」of O, and anything that happens in this region can aﬀect O. Thereforeregion 2 is sometimes called the aﬀective past, or aﬀecting past; it is the locus ofall events which can aﬀect point O in any way.

Region 3, on the other hand, is a region which we can aﬀect from O, we can「hit」things by shooting「bullets」out at speeds less than c. So this is the worldwhose future can be aﬀected by us, and we may call that the aﬀective future.Now the interesting thing about all the rest of space-time, i.e., region 1, is that wecan neither aﬀect it now from O, nor can it aﬀect us now at O, because nothingcan go faster than the speed of light. Of course, what happens at R can aﬀect uslater; that is, if the sun is exploding「right now,」it takes eight minutes beforewe know about it, and it cannot possibly aﬀect us before then.

What we mean by「right now」is a mysterious thing which we cannot deﬁneand we cannot aﬀect, but it can aﬀect us later, or we could have aﬀected it ifwe had done something far enough in the past. When we look at the star AlphaCentauri, we see it as it was four years ago; we might wonder what it is like「now.」「Now」means at the same time from our special coordinate system. Wecan only see Alpha Centauri by the light that has come from our past, up to fouryears ago, but we do not know what it is doing「now」; it will take four yearsbefore what it is doing「now」can aﬀect us. Alpha Centauri「now」is an ideaor concept of our mind; it is not something that is really deﬁnable physicallyat the moment, because we have to wait to observe it; we cannot even deﬁne itright「now.」Furthermore, the「now」depends on the coordinate system. If, for

17-7

example, Alpha Centauri were moving, an observer there would not agree withus because he would put his axes at an angle, and his「now」would be a diﬀerenttime. We have already talked about the fact that simultaneity is not a uniquething.

There are fortune tellers, or people who tell us they can know the future, andthere are many wonderful stories about the man who suddenly discovers thathe has knowledge about the aﬀective future. Well, there are lots of paradoxesproduced by that because if we know something is going to happen, then we canmake sure we will avoid it by doing the right thing at the right time, and so on.But actually there is no fortune teller who can even tell us the present! Thereis no one who can tell us what is really happening right now, at any reasonabledistance, because that is unobservable. We might ask ourselves this question,which we leave to the student to try to answer: Would any paradox be producedif it were suddenly to become possible to know things that are in the space-likeintervals of region 1?

17-4 More about four-vectorsLet us now return to our consideration of the analogy of the Lorentz transfor-mation and rotations of the space axes. We have learned the utility of collectingtogether other quantities which have the same transformation properties as thecoordinates, to form what we call vectors, directed lines. In the case of ordinaryrotations, there are many quantities that transform the same way as x, y, and zunder rotation: for example, the velocity has three components, an x, y, and z-component; when seen in a diﬀerent coordinate system, none of the componentsis the same, instead they are all transformed to new values. But, somehow orother, the velocity「itself」has a greater reality than do any of its particularcomponents, and we represent it by a directed line.

We therefore ask: Is it or is it not true that there are quantities whichtransform, or which are related, in a moving system and in a nonmoving system,in the same way as x, y, z, and t? From our experience with vectors, we know thatthree of the quantities, like x, y, z, would constitute the three components of anordinary space-vector, but the fourth quantity would look like an ordinary scalarunder space rotation, because it does not change so long as we do not go intoa moving coordinate system. Is it possible, then, to associate with some of ourknown「three-vectors」a fourth object, that we could call the「time component,」in such a manner that the four objects together would「rotate」the same way

17-8

as position and time in space-time? We shall now show that there is, indeed, atleast one such thing (there are many of them, in fact): the three components ofmomentum, and the energy as the time component, transform together to makewhat we call a「four-vector.」In demonstrating this, since it is quite inconvenientto have to write c’s everywhere, we shall use the same trick concerning units ofthe energy, the mass, and the momentum, that we used in Eq. (17.4). Energyand mass, for example, diﬀer only by a factor c2 which is merely a question ofunits, so we can say energy is the mass. Instead of having to write the c2, weput E = m, and then, of course, if there were any trouble we would put in theright amounts of c so that the units would straighten out in the last equation,but not in the intermediate ones.

Thus our equations for energy and momentum are

p1 − v2,p1 − v2.

E = m = m0/p = mv = m0v/

(17.6)

Also in these units, we have

E2 − p2 = m20.

(17.7)For example, if we measure energy in electron volts, what does a mass of 1 electronvolt mean? It means the mass whose rest energy is 1 electron volt, that is, m0c2is one electron volt. For example, the rest mass of an electron is 0.511 × 106 eV.Now what would the momentum and energy look like in a new coordinatesystem? To ﬁnd out, we shall have to transform Eq. (17.6), which we can dobecause we know how the velocity transforms. Suppose that, as we measure it,an object has a velocity v, but we look upon the same object from the point ofview of a space ship which itself is moving with a velocity u, and in that systemwe use a prime to designate the corresponding thing. In order to simplify thingsat ﬁrst, we shall take the case that the velocity v is in the direction of u. (Later,we can do the more general case.) What is v0, the velocity as seen from the spaceship? It is the composite velocity, the「diﬀerence」between v and u. By the lawwhich we worked out before,

v0 = v − u1 − uv

.

(17.8)

Now let us calculate the new energy E0, the energy as the fellow in the spaceship would see it. He would use the same rest mass, of course, but he would

17-9

use v0 for the velocity. What we have to do is square v0, subtract it from one,take the square root, and take the reciprocal:v02 = v2 − 2uv + u21 − 2uv + u2v2 ,

1 − v02 = 1 − 2uv + u2v2 − v2 + 2uv − u2

,

1 − 2uv + u2v2

= 1 − v2 − u2 + u2v21 − 2uv + u2v2= (1 − v2)(1 − u2)

(1 − uv)2

.

,

Therefore

1√1 − v02

=

1 − uv

√1 − v2√1 − u2 .

(17.9)

The energy E0 is then simply m0 times the above expression. But we wantto express the energy in terms of the unprimed energy and momentum, and wenote that

E0 = m0 − m0uv√1 − v2√1 − u2

or

√1 − v2) − (m0v/√1 − u2

√1 − v2)u

= (m0/E0 = E − upx√1 − u2 ,

,

(17.10)

which we recognize as being exactly of the same form as

t0 = t − ux√1 − u2 .

x

Next we must ﬁnd the new momentum p0. This is just the energy E0 times v0,and is also simply expressed in terms of E and p:v − u(1 − uv) = m0v − m0u√1 − v2√1 − u2 .= px − uE√1 − u2 ,

= E0v0 = m0(1 − uv)

√1 − v2√1 − u2 ·

(17.11)

Thus

p0

x

p0

x

17-10

which we recognize as being of precisely the same form as

x0 = x − ut√1 − u2 .

Thus the transformations for the new energy and momentum in terms of theold energy and momentum are exactly the same as the transformations for t0 interms of t and x, and x0 in terms of x and t: all we have to do is, every time wesee t in (17.4) substitute E, and every time we see x substitute px, and then theequations (17.4) will become the same as Eqs. (17.10) and (17.11). This wouldimply, if everything works right, an additional rule that p0= pz.To prove this would require our going back and studying the case of motion upand down. Actually, we did study the case of motion up and down in the lastchapter. We analyzed a complicated collision and we noticed that, in fact, thetransverse momentum is not changed when viewed from a moving system; so wehave already veriﬁed that p0= pz. The complete transformation,then, is

= py and that p0

= px − uE√1 − u2 ,p0p0= py,p0= pz,E0 = E − upx√1 − u2 .

(17.12)

In these transformations, therefore, we have discovered four quantities whichtransform like x, y, z, and t, and which we call the four-vector momentum. Sincethe momentum is a four-vector, it can be represented on a space-time diagramof a moving particle as an「arrow」tangent to the path, as shown in Fig. 17-4.This arrow has a time component equal to the energy, and its space components

Fig. 17-4. The four-vector momentum of a particle.

17-11

represent its three-vector momentum; this arrow is more「real」than either theenergy or the momentum, because those just depend on how we look at thediagram.

17-5 Four-vector algebraThe notation for four-vectors is diﬀerent than it is for three-vectors.

Inthe case of three-vectors, if we were to talk about the ordinary three-vectormomentum we would write it p. If we wanted to be more speciﬁc, we could sayit has three components which are, for the axes in question, px, py, and pz, orwe could simply refer to a general component as pi, and say that i could eitherbe x, y, or z, and that these are the three components; that is, imagine that i isany one of three directions, x, y, or z. The notation that we use for four-vectorsis analogous to this: we write pµ for the four-vector, and µ stands for the fourpossible directions t, x, y, or z.We could, of course, use any notation we want; do not laugh at notations;invent them, they are powerful.In fact, mathematics is, to a large extent,invention of better notations. The whole idea of a four-vector, in fact, is animprovement in notation so that the transformations can be remembered easily.Aµ, then, is a general four-vector, but for the special case of momentum, the ptis identiﬁed as the energy, px is the momentum in the x-direction, py is that inthe y-direction, and pz is that in the z-direction. To add four-vectors, we addthe corresponding components.If there is an equation among four-vectors, then the equation is true for eachcomponent. For instance, if the law of conservation of three-vector momentum isto be true in particle collisions, i.e., if the sum of the momenta for a large numberof interacting or colliding particles is to be a constant, that must mean that thesums of all momenta in the x-direction, in the y-direction, and in the z-direction,for all the particles, must each be constant. This law alone would be impossiblein relativity because it is incomplete; it is like talking about only two of thecomponents of a three-vector. It is incomplete because if we rotate the axes, wemix the various components, so we must include all three components in our law.Thus, in relativity, we must complete the law of conservation of momentum byextending it to include the time component. This is absolutely necessary to gowith the other three, or there cannot be relativistic invariance. The conservationof energy is the fourth equation which goes with the conservation of momentum

17-12

to make a valid four-vector relationship in the geometry of space and time. Thusthe law of conservation of energy and momentum in four-dimensional notation is

where i = 1, 2, . . . refers to the particles going into the collision, j = 1, 2, . . .refers to the particles coming out of the collision, and µ = x, y, z, or t. You say,「In which axes?」It makes no diﬀerence. The law is true for each component,using any axes.

In vector analysis we discussed one other thing, the dot product of two vectors.Let us now consider the corresponding thing in space-time. In ordinary rotationwe discovered there was an unchanged quantity x2 + y2 + z2. In four dimensions,we ﬁnd that the corresponding quantity is t2 − x2 − y2 − z2 (Eq. 17.3). How canwe write that? One way would be to write some kind of four-dimensional thingwith a square dot between, like Aµ (cid:0) Bµ; one of the notations which is actuallyused is

(17.15)

AµAµ = A2

t − A2

x − A2

y − A2z.

µ

The prime onP means that the ﬁrst term, the「time」term, is positive, but the

other three terms have minus signs. This quantity, then, will be the same in anycoordinate system, and we may call it the square of the length of the four-vector.For instance, what is the square of the length of the four-vector momentum ofa single particle? This will be equal to p2or, in other words,E2 − p2, because we know that pt is E. What is E2 − p2? It must be somethingwhich is the same in every coordinate system. In particular, it must be the samefor a coordinate system which is moving right along with the particle, in whichthe particle is standing still. If the particle is standing still, it would have nomomentum. So in that coordinate system, it is purely its energy, which is thesame as its rest mass. Thus E2 − p2 = m20. So we see that the square of thelength of this vector, the four-vector momentum, is equal to m20.

x − p2

y − p2

t − p2

z

17-13

From the square of a vector, we can go on to invent the「dot product,」or theproduct which is a scalar: if aµ is one four-vector and bµ is another four-vector,

then the scalar product isX0

aµbµ = atbt − axbx − ayby − azbz.

(17.16)

It is the same in all coordinate systems.

Finally, we shall mention certain things whose rest mass m0 is zero. A photonof light, for example. A photon is like a particle, in that it carries an energyand a momentum. The energy of a photon is a certain constant, called Planck’sconstant, times the frequency of the photon: E = hν. Such a photon also carriesa momentum, and the momentum of a photon (or of any other particle, in fact)is h divided by the wavelength: p = h/λ. But, for a photon, there is a deﬁniterelationship between the frequency and the wavelength: ν = c/λ. (The numberof waves per second, times the wavelength of each, is the distance that the lightgoes in one second, which, of course, is c.) Thus we see immediately that theenergy of a photon must be the momentum times c, or if c = 1, the energy andmomentum are equal. That is to say, the rest mass is zero. Let us look at thatagain; that is quite curious. If it is a particle of zero rest mass, what happenswhen it stops? It never stops! It always goes at the speed c. The usual formula√1 − v2. Now can we say that m0 = 0 and v = 1, so the energyfor energy is m0/is 0? We cannot say that it is zero; the photon really can (and does) have energyeven though it has no rest mass, but this it possesses by perpetually going at thespeed of light!

We also know that the momentum of any particle is equal to its total energytimes its velocity: if c = 1, p = vE or, in ordinary units, p = vE/c2. For anyparticle moving at the speed of light, p = E if c = 1. The formulas for the energyof a photon as seen from a moving system are, of course, given by Eq. (17.12),but for the momentum we must substitute the energy times c (or times 1 in thiscase). The diﬀerent energies after transformation means that there are diﬀerentfrequencies. This is called the Doppler eﬀect, and one can calculate it easily fromEq. (17.12), using also E = p and E = hν.shadows, and only a kind of union between them shall survive.」

As Minkowski said,「Space of itself, and time of itself will sink into mere
