Center of Mass; Moment of Inertia

19-1 Properties of the center of massIn the previous chapter we found that if a great many forces are acting on acomplicated mass of particles, whether the particles comprise a rigid or a nonrigidbody, or a cloud of stars, or anything else, and we ﬁnd the sum of all the forces(that is, of course, the external forces, because the internal forces balance out),then if we consider the body as a whole, and say it has a total mass M, there isa certain point「inside」the body, called the center of mass, such that the netresulting external force produces an acceleration of this point, just as though thewhole mass were concentrated there. Let us now discuss the center of mass in alittle more detail.

The location of the center of mass (abbreviated CM) is given by the equation

P miriP mi

RCM =

.

(19.1)

This is, of course, a vector equation which is really three equations, one foreach of the three directions. We shall consider only the x-direction, becauseif we can understand that one, we can understand the other two. What does

XCM =P mixi/P mi mean? Suppose for a moment that the object is dividedby the number of things that we have added: XCM = mP xi/mN =P xi/N.

into little pieces, all of which have the same mass m; then the total mass issimply the number N of pieces times the mass of one piece, say one gram, or anyunit. Then this equation simply says that we add all the x’s, and then divideIn other words, XCM is the average of all the x’s, if the masses are equal. Butsuppose one of them were twice as heavy as the others. Then in the sum, that xwould come in twice. This is easy to understand, for we can think of this doublemass as being split into two equal ones, just like the others; then in taking theaverage, of course, we have to count that x twice because there are two masses

19-1

there. Thus X is the average position, in the x-direction, of all the masses, everymass being counted a number of times proportional to the mass, as though itwere divided into「little grams.」From this it is easy to prove that X must besomewhere between the largest and the smallest x, and, therefore lies inside theenvelope including the entire body. It does not have to be in the material of thebody, for the body could be a circle, like a hoop, and the center of mass is in thecenter of the hoop, not in the hoop itself.

Of course, if an object is symmetrical in some way, for instance, a rectangle,so that it has a plane of symmetry, the center of mass lies somewhere on theplane of symmetry. In the case of a rectangle there are two planes, and thatlocates it uniquely. But if it is just any symmetrical object, then the center ofgravity lies somewhere on the axis of symmetry, because in those circumstancesthere are as many positive as negative x’s.

Fig. 19-1. The CM of a compound body lies on the line joining the

CM’s of the two composite parts.

Another interesting proposition is the following very curious one. Supposethat we imagine an object to be made of two pieces, A and B (Fig. 19-1). Thenthe center of mass of the whole object can be calculated as follows. First, ﬁnd thecenter of mass of piece A, and then of piece B. Also, ﬁnd the total mass of eachpiece, MA and MB. Then consider a new problem, in which a point mass MA isat the center of mass of object A, and another point mass MB is at the centerof mass of object B. The center of mass of these two point masses is then thecenter of mass of the whole object. In other words, if the centers of mass ofvarious parts of an object have been worked out, we do not have to start all overagain to ﬁnd the center of mass of the whole object; we just have to put thepieces together, treating each one as a point mass situated at the center of massof that piece. Let us see why that is. Suppose that we wanted to calculate thecenter of mass of a complete object, some of whose particles are considered to

be members of object A and some members of object B. The total sumP mixi

19-2

can then be split into two pieces—the sumPthe sumP

A mixi for the A object only, andB mixi for object B only. Now if we were computing the center ofmass of object A alone, we would have exactly the ﬁrst of these sums, and weknow that this by itself is MAXA, the total mass of all the particles in A timesthe position of the center of mass of A, because that is the theorem of the centerof mass, applied to object A. In the same manner, just by looking at object B,we get MBXB, and of course, adding the two yields M XCM:

M XCM =X

mixi +X

mixi= MAXA + MBXB.

A

(19.2)Now since M is evidently the sum of MA and MB, we see that Eq. (19.2) canbe interpreted as a special example of the center of mass formula for two pointobjects, one of mass MA located at XA and the other of mass MB located at XB.The theorem concerning the motion of the center of mass is very interesting,and has played an important part in the development of our understanding ofphysics. Suppose we assume that Newton’s law is right for the small componentparts of a much larger object. Then this theorem shows that Newton’s law is alsocorrect for the larger object, even if we do not study the details of the object, butonly the total force acting on it and its mass. In other words, Newton’s law hasthe peculiar property that if it is right on a certain small scale, then it will beright on a larger scale. If we do not consider a baseball as a tremendously complexthing, made of myriads of interacting particles, but study only the motion of thecenter of mass and the external forces on the ball, we ﬁnd F = ma, where Fis the external force on the baseball, m is its mass, and a is the acceleration ofits center of mass. So F = ma is a law which reproduces itself on a larger scale.(There ought to be a good word, out of the Greek, perhaps, to describe a lawwhich reproduces the same law on a larger scale.)

Of course, one might suspect that the ﬁrst laws that would be discoveredby human beings would be those that would reproduce themselves on a largerscale. Why? Because the actual scale of the fundamental gears and wheels of theuniverse are of atomic dimensions, which are so much ﬁner than our observationsthat we are nowhere near that scale in our ordinary observations. So the ﬁrstthings that we would discover must be true for objects of no special size relative toan atomic scale. If the laws for small particles did not reproduce themselves on alarger scale, we would not discover those laws very easily. What about the reverse

19-3

problem? Must the laws on a small scale be the same as those on a larger scale?Of course it is not necessarily so in nature, that at an atomic level the laws haveto be the same as on a large scale. Suppose that the true laws of motion of atomswere given by some strange equation which does not have the property that whenwe go to a larger scale we reproduce the same law, but instead has the propertythat if we go to a larger scale, we can approximate it by a certain expression suchthat, if we extend that expression up and up, it keeps reproducing itself on alarger and larger scale. That is possible, and in fact that is the way it works.Newton’s laws are the「tail end」of the atomic laws, extrapolated to a very largesize. The actual laws of motion of particles on a ﬁne scale are very peculiar, butif we take large numbers of them and compound them, they approximate, butonly approximate, Newton’s laws. Newton’s laws then permit us to go on to ahigher and higher scale, and it still seems to be the same law. In fact, it becomesmore and more accurate as the scale gets larger and larger. This self-reproducingfactor of Newton’s laws is thus really not a fundamental feature of nature, butis an important historical feature. We would never discover the fundamentallaws of the atomic particles at ﬁrst observation because the ﬁrst observationsare much too crude. In fact, it turns out that the fundamental atomic laws,which we call quantum mechanics, are quite diﬀerent from Newton’s laws, andare diﬃcult to understand because all our direct experiences are with large-scaleobjects and the small-scale atoms behave like nothing we see on a large scale. Sowe cannot say,「An atom is just like a planet going around the sun,」or anythinglike that. It is like nothing we are familiar with because there is nothing likeit. As we apply quantum mechanics to larger and larger things, the laws aboutthe behavior of many atoms together do not reproduce themselves, but producenew laws, which are Newton’s laws, which then continue to reproduce themselvesfrom, say, micro-microgram size, which still is billions and billions of atoms, onup to the size of the earth, and above.

Let us now return to the center of mass. The center of mass is sometimescalled the center of gravity, for the reason that, in many cases, gravity may beconsidered uniform. Let us suppose that we have small enough dimensions that thegravitational force is not only proportional to the mass, but is everywhere parallelto some ﬁxed line. Then consider an object in which there are gravitational forceson each of its constituent masses. Let mi be the mass of one part. Then thegravitational force on that part is mi times g. Now the question is, where can weapply a single force to balance the gravitational force on the whole thing, so thatthe entire object, if it is a rigid body, will not turn? The answer is that this force

19-4

τ =X

X

migxi = g

mixi,

must go through the center of mass, and we show this in the following way. Inorder that the body will not turn, the torque produced by all the forces must addup to zero, because if there is a torque, there is a change of angular momentum,and thus a rotation. So we must calculate the total of all the torques on all theparticles, and see how much torque there is about any given axis; it should bezero if this axis is at the center of mass. Now, measuring x horizontally and yvertically, we know that the torques are the forces in the y-direction, times thelever arm x (that is to say, the force times the lever arm around which we wantto measure the torque). Now the total torque is the sum

(19.3)

so if the total torque is to be zero, the sumP mixi must be zero. ButP mixi =

M XCM, the total mass times the distance of the center of mass from the axis.Thus the x-distance of the center of mass from the axis is zero.Of course, we have checked the result only for the x-distance, but if we usethe true center of mass the object will balance in any position, because if weturned it 90 degrees, we would have y’s instead of x’s. In other words, when anobject is supported at its center of mass, there is no torque on it because of aparallel gravitational ﬁeld. In case the object is so large that the nonparallelismof the gravitational forces is signiﬁcant, then the center where one must applythe balancing force is not simple to describe, and it departs slightly from thecenter of mass. That is why one must distinguish between the center of mass andthe center of gravity. The fact that an object supported exactly at the center ofmass will balance in all positions has another interesting consequence. If, insteadof gravitation, we have a pseudo force due to acceleration, we may use exactlythe same mathematical procedure to ﬁnd the position to support it so that thereare no torques produced by the inertial force of acceleration. Suppose that theobject is held in some manner inside a box, and that the box, and everythingcontained in it, is accelerating. We know that, from the point of view of someoneat rest relative to this accelerating box, there will be an eﬀective force due toinertia. That is, to make the object go along with the box, we have to push on itto accelerate it, and this force is「balanced」by the「force of inertia,」which is apseudo force equal to the mass times the acceleration of the box. To the man inthe box, this is the same situation as if the object were in a uniform gravitationalﬁeld whose「g」value is equal to the acceleration a. Thus the inertial force dueto accelerating an object has no torque about the center of mass.

19-5

This fact has a very interesting consequence. In an inertial frame that isnot accelerating, the torque is always equal to the rate of change of the angularmomentum. However, about an axis through the center of mass of an objectwhich is accelerating, it is still true that the torque is equal to the rate of changeof the angular momentum. Even if the center of mass is accelerating, we maystill choose one special axis, namely, one passing through the center of mass, suchthat it will still be true that the torque is equal to the rate of change of angularmomentum around that axis. Thus the theorem that torque equals the rate ofchange of angular momentum is true in two general cases: (1) a ﬁxed axis ininertial space, (2) an axis through the center of mass, even though the objectmay be accelerating.

19-2 Locating the center of massThe mathematical techniques for the calculation of centers of mass are in theprovince of a mathematics course, and such problems provide good exercise inintegral calculus. After one has learned calculus, however, and wants to knowhow to locate centers of mass, it is nice to know certain tricks which can be usedto do so. One such trick makes use of what is called the theorem of Pappus. Itworks like this: if we take any closed area in a plane and generate a solid bymoving it through space such that each point is always moved perpendicular tothe plane of the area, the resulting solid has a total volume equal to the area ofthe cross section times the distance that the center of mass moved! Certainlythis is true if we move the area in a straight line perpendicular to itself, but ifwe move it in a circle or in some other curve, then it generates a rather peculiarvolume. For a curved path, the outside goes around farther, and the inside goesaround less, and these eﬀects balance out. So if we want to locate the centerof mass of a plane sheet of uniform density, we can remember that the volumegenerated by spinning it about an axis is the distance that the center of massgoes around, times the area of the sheet.

For example, if we wish to ﬁnd the center of mass of a right triangle ofbase D and height H (Fig. 19-2), we might solve the problem in the followingway. Imagine an axis along H, and rotate the triangle about that axis througha full 360 degrees. This generates a cone. The distance that the x-coordinateof the center of mass has moved is 2πx. The area which is being moved is thearea of the triangle, 12 HD. So the x-distance of the center of mass times thearea of the triangle is the volume swept out, which is of course πD2H/3. Thus

19-6

Fig. 19-2. A right triangle and a right circular cone generated by

rotating the triangle.(2πx)( 12 HD) = πD2H/3, or x = D/3. In a similar manner, by rotating aboutthe other axis, or by symmetry, we ﬁnd y = H/3. In fact, the center of massof any uniform triangular area is where the three medians, the lines from thevertices through the centers of the opposite sides, all meet. That point is 1/3of the way along each median. Clue: Slice the triangle up into a lot of littlepieces, each parallel to a base. Note that the median line bisects every piece, andtherefore the center of mass must lie on this line.

Now let us try a more complicated ﬁgure. Suppose that it is desired to ﬁndthe position of the center of mass of a uniform semicircular disc—a disc sliced inhalf. Where is the center of mass? For a full disc, it is at the center, of course,but a half-disc is more diﬃcult. Let r be the radius and x be the distance of thecenter of mass from the straight edge of the disc. Spin it around this edge as axisto generate a sphere. Then the center of mass has gone around 2πx, the areais πr2/2 (because it is only half a circle). The volume generated is, of course,4πr3/3, from which we ﬁnd that

or

(2πx)( 1

2 πr2) = 4πr3/3,

x = 4r/3π.

There is another theorem of Pappus which is a special case of the above one,and therefore equally true. Suppose that, instead of the solid semicircular disc,we have a semicircular piece of wire with uniform mass density along the wire,and we want to ﬁnd its center of mass. In this case there is no mass in theinterior, only on the wire. Then it turns out that the area which is swept bya plane curved line, when it moves as before, is the distance that the center ofmass moves times the length of the line. (The line can be thought of as a verynarrow area, and the previous theorem can be applied to it.)

19-7

19-3 Finding the moment of inertiaNow let us discuss the problem of ﬁnding the moments of inertia of variousobjects. The formula for the moment of inertia about the z-axis of an object is

That is, we must sum the masses, each one multiplied by the square of itsdistance (x2) from the axis. Note that it is not the three-dimensionaldistance, only the two-dimensional distance squared, even for a three-dimensionalobject. For the most part, we shall restrict ourselves to two-dimensional objects,but the formula for rotation about the z-axis is just the same in three dimensions.

Fig. 19-3. A straight rod of length L rotating about an axis through

one end.

As a simple example, consider a rod rotating about a perpendicular axisthrough one end (Fig. 19-3). Now we must sum all the masses times the x-distances squared (the y’s being all zero in this case). What we mean by「thesum,」of course, is the integral of x2 times the little elements of mass. If wedivide the rod into small elements of length dx, the corresponding elements ofmass are proportional to dx, and if dx were the length of the whole rod the masswould be M. Therefore

and so

(19.5)

The dimensions of moment of inertia are always mass times length squared, soall we really had to work out was the factor 1/3.

19-8

Now what is I if the rotation axis is at the center of the rod? We could justdo the integral over again, letting x range from − 12 L. But let us noticea few things about the moment of inertia. We can imagine the rod as two rods,each of mass M/2 and length L/2; the moments of inertia of the two small rodsare equal, and are both given by the formula (19.5). Therefore the moment ofinertia is

2 L to + 1

I = 2(M/2)(L/2)2

= M L212 .

(19.6)

Thus it is much easier to turn a rod about its center, than to swing it around anend.

Of course, we could go on to compute the moments of inertia of various otherbodies of interest. However, while such computations provide a certain amount ofimportant exercise in the calculus, they are not basically of interest to us as such.There is, however, an interesting theorem which is very useful. Suppose we havean object, and we want to ﬁnd its moment of inertia around some axis. Thatmeans we want the inertia needed to carry it by rotation about that axis. Now ifwe support the object on pivots at the center of mass, so that the object does notturn as it rotates about the axis (because there is no torque on it from inertialeﬀects, and therefore it will not turn when we start moving it), then the forcesneeded to swing it around are the same as though all the mass were concentratedat the center of mass, and the moment of inertia would be simply I1 = M R2CM,where RCM is the distance from the axis to the center of mass. But of coursethat is not the right formula for the moment of inertia of an object which is reallybeing rotated as it revolves, because not only is the center of it moving in a circle,which would contribute an amount I1 to the moment of inertia, but also we mustturn it about its center of mass. So it is not unreasonable that we must add to I1the moment of inertia Ic about the center of mass. So it is a good guess that thetotal moment of inertia about any axis will beI = Ic + M R2

(19.7)

the yi’s, each squared: I =P(x2

This theorem is called the parallel-axis theorem, and may be easily proved.The moment of inertia about any axis is the mass times the sum of the xi’s and)mi. We shall concentrate on the x’s, butof course the y’s work the same way. Now x is the distance of a particular pointmass from the origin, but let us consider how it would look if we measured x0from the CM, instead of x from the origin. To get ready for this analysis, we

CM. In the second sum there are two pieces,The third sum is easy; it is just M X2, which is the total mass times the x0-coordinate of thecenter of mass. But this contributes nothing, because x0 is measured from thecenter of mass, and in these axes the average position of all the particles, weightedby the masses, is zero. The ﬁrst sum, of course, is the x part of Ic. Thus wearrive at Eq. (19.7), just as we guessed.Let us check (19.7) for one example. Let us just see whether it works for therod. For an axis through one end, the moment of inertia should be M L2/3, for wecalculated that. The center of mass of a rod, of course, is in the center of the rod,at a distance L/2. Therefore we should ﬁnd that M L2/3 = M L2/12 + M(L/2)2.Since one-quarter plus one-twelfth is one-third, we have made no fundamentalerror.

Incidentally, we did not really need to use an integral to ﬁnd the moment ofinertia (19.5). If we simply assume that it is M L2 times γ, an unknown coeﬃcient,4 γ for (19.6), then fromand then use the argument about the two halves to get 1our argument about transferring the axes we could prove that γ = 14, so γmust be 1/3. There is always another way to do it!In applying the parallel-axis theorem, it is of course important to rememberthat the axis for Ic must be parallel to the axis about which the moment of inertiais wanted.One further property of the moment of inertia is worth mentioning because itis often helpful in ﬁnding the moment of inertia of certain kinds of objects. Thisproperty is that if one has a plane ﬁgure and a set of coordinate axes with originin the plane and z-axis perpendicular to the plane, then the moment of inertia ofthis ﬁgure about the z-axis is equal to the sum of the moments of inertia about

4 γ + 1

19-10

the x- and y-axes. This is easily proved by noting that

As an example, the moment of inertia of a uniform rectangular plate of mass M,width w, and length L, about an axis perpendicular to the plate and throughits center is simply

I = M(w2 + L2)/12,

because its moment of inertia about an axis in its plane and parallel to its lengthis M w2/12, i.e., just as for a rod of length w, and the moment of inertia aboutthe other axis in its plane is M L2/12, just as for a rod of length L.To summarize, the moment of inertia of an object about a given axis, whichwe shall call the z-axis, has the following properties:(1) The moment of inertia is

(2) If the object is made of a number of parts, each of whose moment of inertiais known, the total moment of inertia is the sum of the moments of inertiaof the pieces.

(3) The moment of inertia about any given axis is equal to the moment ofinertia about a parallel axis through the CM plus the total mass times thesquare of the distance from the axis to the CM.

(4) If the object is a plane ﬁgure, the moment of inertia about an axis perpen-dicular to the plane is equal to the sum of the moments of inertia aboutany two mutually perpendicular axes lying in the plane and intersecting atthe perpendicular axis.

19-4 Rotational kinetic energyNow let us go on to discuss dynamics further. In the analogy between linearmotion and angular motion that we discussed in Chapter 18, we used the worktheorem, but we did not talk about kinetic energy. What is the kinetic energy ofa rigid body, rotating about a certain axis with an angular velocity ω? We canimmediately guess the correct answer by using our analogies. The moment ofinertia corresponds to the mass, angular velocity corresponds to velocity, and so

19-12

the kinetic energy ought to be 12 Iω2, and indeed it is, as will now be demonstrated.Suppose the object is rotating about some axis so that each point has a velocitywhose magnitude is ωri, where ri is the radius from the particular point to theaxis. Then if mi is the mass of that point, the total kinetic energy of the wholething is just the sum of the kinetic energies of all of the little pieces:

Now ω2 is a constant, the same for all points. Thus

(19.8)

At the end of Chapter 18 we pointed out that there are some interestingphenomena associated with an object which is not rigid, but which changes fromone rigid condition with a deﬁnite moment of inertia, to another rigid condition.Namely, in our example of the turntable, we had a certain moment of inertia I1with our arms stretched out, and a certain angular velocity ω1. When we pulledour arms in, we had a diﬀerent moment of inertia, I2, and a diﬀerent angularvelocity, ω2, but again we were「rigid.」The angular momentum remained constant,since there was no torque about the vertical axis of the turntable. This meansthat I1ω1 = I2ω2. Now what about the energy? That is an interesting question.With our arms pulled in, we turn faster, but our moment of inertia is less, and itlooks as though the energies might be equal. But they are not, because whatdoes balance is Iω, not Iω2. So if we compare the kinetic energy before andafter, the kinetic energy before is 12 Lω1, where L = I1ω1 = I2ω2 is theangular momentum. Afterward, by the same argument, we have T = 12 Lω2 andsince ω2 > ω1 the kinetic energy of rotation is greater than it was before. So wehad a certain energy when our arms were out, and when we pulled them in, wewere turning faster and had more kinetic energy. What happened to the theoremof the conservation of energy? Somebody must have done some work. We didwork! When did we do any work? When we move a weight horizontally, we donot do any work. If we hold a thing out and pull it in, we do not do any work.But that is when we are not rotating! When we are rotating, there is centrifugalforce on the weights. They are trying to ﬂy out, so when we are going aroundwe have to pull the weights in against the centrifugal force. So, the work wedo against the centrifugal force ought to agree with the diﬀerence in rotationalenergy, and of course it does. That is where the extra kinetic energy comes from.

1 = 1

19-13

There is still another interesting feature which we can treat only descriptively,as a matter of general interest. This feature is a little more advanced, but isworth pointing out because it is quite curious and produces many interestingeﬀects.

Consider that turntable experiment again. Consider the body and the armsseparately, from the point of view of the man who is rotating. After the weightsare pulled in, the whole object is spinning faster, but observe, the central partof the body is not changed, yet it is turning faster after the event than before.So, if we were to draw a circle around the inner body, and consider only objectsinside the circle, their angular momentum would change; they are going faster.Therefore there must be a torque exerted on the body while we pull in our arms.No torque can be exerted by the centrifugal force, because that is radial. So thatmeans that among the forces that are developed in a rotating system, centrifugalforce is not the entire story, there is another force. This other force is calledCoriolis force, and it has the very strange property that when we move somethingin a rotating system, it seems to be pushed sidewise. Like the centrifugal force,it is an apparent force. But if we live in a system that is rotating, and movesomething radially, we ﬁnd that we must also push it sidewise to move it radially.This sidewise push which we have to exert is what turned our body around.

Now let us develop a formula to show how this Coriolis force really works.Suppose Moe is sitting on a carousel that appears to him to be stationary. Butfrom the point of view of Joe, who is standing on the ground and who knowsthe right laws of mechanics, the carousel is going around. Suppose that we havedrawn a radial line on the carousel, and that Moe is moving some mass radiallyalong this line. We would like to demonstrate that a sidewise force is required todo that. We can do this by paying attention to the angular momentum of themass. It is always going around with the same angular velocity ω, so that theangular momentum is

L = mvtangr = mωr · r = mωr2.

So when the mass is close to the center, it has relatively little angular momentum,but if we move it to a new position farther out, if we increase r, m has moreangular momentum, so a torque must be exerted in order to move it along theradius. (To walk along the radius in a carousel, one has to lean over and pushsidewise. Try it sometime.) The torque that is required is the rate of change of Lwith time as m moves along the radius. If m moves only along the radius, omega

19-14

stays constant, so that the torque is

where Fc is the Coriolis force. What we really want to know is what sidewiseforce has to be exerted by Moe in order to move m out at speed vr = dr/dt. Thisis Fc = τ /r = 2mωvr.Now that we have a formula for the Coriolis force, let us look at the situationa little more carefully, to see whether we can understand the origin of this forcefrom a more elementary point of view. We note that the Coriolis force is the sameat every radius, and is evidently present even at the origin! But it is especiallyeasy to understand it at the origin, just by looking at what happens from theinertial system of Joe, who is standing on the ground. Figure 19-4 shows threesuccessive views of m just as it passes the origin at t = 0. Because of the rotationof the carousel, we see that m does not move in a straight line, but in a curvedpath tangent to a diameter of the carousel where r = 0. In order for m to goin a curve, there must be a force to accelerate it in absolute space. This is theCoriolis force.

rotating turntable.

This is not the only case in which the Coriolis force occurs. We can alsoshow that if an object is moving with constant speed around the circumferenceof a circle, there is also a Coriolis force. Why? Moe sees a velocity vM aroundthe circle. On the other hand, Joe sees m going around the circle with thevelocity vJ = vM + ωr, because m is also carried by the carousel. Thereforewe know what the force really is, namely, the total centripetal force due to thevelocity vJ, or mv2J /r; that is the actual force. Now from Moe’s point of view,this centripetal force has three pieces. We may write it all out as follows:

Fr = − mv2

Now, Fr is the force that Moe would see. Let us try to understand it. Would Moeappreciate the ﬁrst term?「Yes,」he would say,「even if I were not turning, therewould be a centripetal force if I were to run around a circle with velocity vM.」This is simply the centripetal force that Moe would expect, having nothing to dowith rotation. In addition, Moe is quite aware that there is another centripetalforce that would act even on objects which are standing still on his carousel. Thisis the third term. But there is another term in addition to these, namely thesecond term, which is again 2mωv. The Coriolis force Fc was tangential whenthe velocity was radial, and now it is radial when the velocity is tangential. Infact, one expression has a minus sign relative to the other. The force is alwaysin the same direction, relative to the velocity, no matter in which direction thevelocity is. The force is at right angles to the velocity, and of magnitude 2mωv.
