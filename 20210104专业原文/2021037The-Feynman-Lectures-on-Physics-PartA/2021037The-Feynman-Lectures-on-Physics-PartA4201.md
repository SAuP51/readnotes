Applications of Kinetic Theory

42-1 EvaporationIn this chapter we shall discuss some further applications of kinetic theory.In the previous chapter we emphasized one particular aspect of kinetic theory,namely, that the average kinetic energy in any degree of freedom of a moleculeor other object is 12 kT. The central feature of what we shall now discuss, onthe other hand, is the fact that the probability of ﬁnding a particle in diﬀerentplaces, per unit volume, varies as e−potential energy/kT ; we shall make a number ofapplications of this.The phenomena which we want to study are relatively complicated: a liquidevaporating, or electrons in a metal coming out of the surface, or a chemicalreaction in which there are a large number of atoms involved. In such cases it is nolonger possible to make from the kinetic theory any simple and correct statements,because the situation is too complicated. Therefore, this chapter, except whereotherwise emphasized, is quite inexact. The idea to be emphasized is only thatwe can understand, from the kinetic theory, more or less how things ought tobehave. By using thermodynamic arguments, or some empirical measurementsof certain critical quantities, we can get a more accurate representation of thephenomena.

However, it is very useful to know even only more or less why somethingbehaves as it does, so that when the situation is a new one, or one that we havenot yet started to analyze, we can say, more or less, what ought to happen. Sothis discussion is highly inaccurate but essentially right—right in idea, but alittle bit simpliﬁed, let us say, in the speciﬁc details.

The ﬁrst example that we shall consider is the evaporation of a liquid. Supposewe have a box with a large volume, partially ﬁlled with liquid in equilibrium andwith the vapor at a certain temperature. We shall suppose that the molecules ofthe vapor are relatively far apart, and that inside the liquid, the molecules are

42-1

packed close together. The problem is to ﬁnd out how many molecules there arein the vapor phase, compared with the number there are in the liquid. How denseis the vapor at a given temperature, and how does it depend on the temperature?Let us say that n equals the number of molecules per unit volume in thevapor. That number, of course, varies with the temperature. If we add heat,we get more evaporation. Now let another quantity, 1/Va, equal the number ofatoms per unit volume in the liquid: We suppose that each molecule in the liquidoccupies a certain volume, so that if there are more molecules of liquid, then alltogether they occupy a bigger volume. Thus if Va is the volume occupied by onemolecule, the number of molecules in a unit volume is a unit volume divided bythe volume of each molecule. Furthermore, we suppose that there is a force ofattraction between the molecules to hold them together in the liquid. Otherwisewe cannot understand why it condenses. Thus suppose that there is such a forceand that there is an energy of binding of the molecules in the liquid which is lostwhen they go into the vapor. That is, we are going to suppose that, in orderto take a single molecule out of the liquid into the vapor, a certain amount ofwork W has to be done. There is a certain diﬀerence, W, in the energy of amolecule in the liquid from what it would have if it were in the vapor, becausewe have to pull it away from the other molecules which attract it.

Now we use the general principle that the number of atoms per unit volume intwo diﬀerent regions is n2/n1 = e−(E2−E1)/kT . So the number n per unit volumein the vapor, divided by the number 1/Va per unit volume in the liquid, is equalto

nVa = e−W/kT ,

(42.1)because that is the general rule. It is like the atmosphere in equilibrium undergravity, where the gas at the bottom is denser than that at the top because ofthe work mgh needed to lift the gas molecules to the height h. In the liquid, themolecules are denser than in the vapor because we have to pull them out throughthe energy「hill」W, and the ratio of the densities is e−W/kT .

This is what we wanted to deduce—that the vapor density varies as e to theminus some energy or other over kT. The factors in front are not really interestingto us, because in most cases the vapor density is very much lower than the liquiddensity. In those circumstances, where we are not near the critical point wherethey are almost the same, but where the vapor density is much lower than theliquid density, then the fact that n is very much less than 1/Va is occasionedby the fact that W is very much greater than kT. So formulas such as (42.1)

42-2

are interesting only when W is very much bigger than kT, because in thosecircumstances, since we are raising e to minus a tremendous amount, if we changeT a little bit, that tremendous power changes a bit, and the change produced inthe exponential factor is very much more important than any change that mightoccur in the factors out in front. Why should there be any changes in such factorsas Va? Because ours was an approximate analysis. After all, there is not really adeﬁnite volume for each molecule; as we change the temperature, the volume Vadoes not stay constant—the liquid expands. There are other little features likethat, and so the actual situation is more complicated. There are slowly varyingtemperature-dependent factors all over the place. In fact, we might say that Witself varies slightly with temperature, because at a higher temperature, at adiﬀerent molecular volume, there would be diﬀerent average attractions, and soon. So, while we might think that if we have a formula in which everything variesin an unknown way with temperature then we have no formula at all, if we realizethat the exponent W/kT is, in general, very large, we see that in the curve of thevapor density as a function of temperature most of the variation is occasioned bythe exponential factor, and if we take W as a constant and the coeﬃcient 1/Vaas nearly constant, it is a good approximation for short intervals along the curve.Most of the variation, in other words, is of the general nature e−W/kT .It turns out that there are many, many phenomena in nature which arecharacterized by having to borrow an energy from somewhere, and in whichthe central feature of the temperature variation is e to the minus the energyover kT. This is a useful fact only when the energy is large compared with kT,so that most of the variation is contained in the variation of the kT and not inthe constant and in other factors.Now let us consider another way of obtaining a somewhat similar result forthe evaporation, but looking at it in more detail. To arrive at (42.1), we simplyapplied a rule which is valid at equilibrium, but in order to understand thingsbetter, there is no harm in trying to look at the details of what is going on. Wemay also describe what is going on in the following way: the molecules thatare in the vapor continually bombard the surface of the liquid; when they hitit, they may bounce oﬀ or they may get stuck. There is an unknown factor forthat—maybe 50–50, maybe 10 to 90—we do not know. Let us say they alwaysget stuck—we can analyze it over again later on the assumption that they donot always get stuck. Then at a given moment there will be a certain numberof atoms which are condensing onto the surface of the liquid. The number ofcondensing molecules, the number that arrive on a unit area per unit time, is the

42-3

number n per unit volume times the velocity v. This velocity of the moleculesis related to the temperature, because we know that 12 kT onthe average. So v is some kind of a mean velocity. Of course we should integrateover the angles and get some kind of an average, but it is roughly proportionalto the root-mean-square velocity, within some factor. Thus

2 mv2 is equal to 3

Nc = nv

(42.2)

is the rate at which the molecules arrive per unit area and are condensing.

At the same time, however, the atoms in the liquid are jiggling about, andfrom time to time one of them gets kicked out. Now we have to estimate howfast they get kicked out. The idea will be that at equilibrium the number thatare kicked out per second and the number that arrive per second are equal.

How many get kicked out? In order to get kicked out, a particular molecule hasto have acquired by accident an excess energy over its neighbors—a considerableexcess energy, because it is attracted very strongly by the other molecules inthe liquid. Ordinarily it does not leave because it is so strongly attracted, butin the collisions sometimes one of them gets an extra energy by accident. Andthe chance that it gets the extra energy W which it needs in our case is verysmall if W (cid:29) kT. In fact, e−W/kT is the chance that an atom has picked upmore than this much energy. That is the general principle in kinetic theory: inorder to borrow an excess energy W over the average, the odds are e to theminus the energy that we have to borrow, over kT. Now suppose that somemolecules have borrowed this energy. We now have to estimate how many leavethe surface per second. Of course, just because a molecule has the necessaryenergy does not mean that it will actually evaporate, since it may be buried toodeeply inside the liquid or, even if it is near the surface, it may be travellingin the wrong direction. The number that are going to leave a unit area persecond is going to be something like this: the number of atoms there are nearthe surface, per unit area, divided by the time it takes one to escape, multipliedby the probability e−W/kT that they are ready to escape in the sense that theyhave enough energy.

We shall suppose that each molecule at the surface of the liquid occupiesa certain cross-sectional area A. Then the number of molecules per unit areaof liquid surface will be 1/A. And now, how long does it take a molecule toescape? If the molecules have a certain average speed v, and have to move, say,one molecular diameter D, the thickness of the ﬁrst layer, then the time it takes

42-4

to get across that thickness is the time needed to escape, if the molecule hasenough energy. The time will be D/v. Thus the number evaporating should beapproximately(42.3)Now the area of each atom times the thickness of the layer is approximatelythe same as the volume Va occupied by a single atom. And so, in order to getequilibrium, we must have Nc = Ne, or

Ne = (1/A)(v/D)e−W/kT .

nv = (v/Va)e−W/kT .

(42.4)We may cancel the v’s, since they are equal; even though one is the velocity of amolecule in the vapor and the other is the velocity of an evaporating molecule,these are the same, because we know their mean kinetic energy (in one direction)2 kT. But one may object,「No! No! These are the especially fast-moving ones;is 1these are the ones that have picked up excess energy.」Not really, because themoment they start to pull away from the liquid, they have to lose that excessenergy against the potential energy. So, as they come to the surface they areslowed down to the velocity v! It is the same as it was in our discussion ofthe distribution of molecular velocities in the atmosphere—at the bottom, themolecules had a certain distribution of energy. The ones that arrive at the tophave the same distribution of energy, because the slow ones did not arrive atall, and the fast ones were slowed down. The molecules that are evaporatinghave the same distribution of energy as the ones inside—a rather remarkablefact. Anyway, it is useless to try to argue so closely about our formula because ofother inaccuracies, such as the probability of bouncing back rather than enteringthe liquid, and so on. Thus we have a rough idea of the rate of evaporation andcondensation, and we see, of course, that the vapor density n varies in the sameway as before, but now we have understood it in some detail rather than just asan arbitrary formula.

This deeper understanding permits us to analyze some things. For example,suppose that we were to pump away the vapor at such a great rate that weremoved the vapor as fast as it formed (if we had very good pumps and the liquidwas evaporating very slowly), how fast would evaporation occur if we maintaineda liquid temperature T? Suppose that we have already experimentally measuredthe equilibrium vapor density, so that we know, at the given temperature, howmany molecules per unit volume are in equilibrium with the liquid. Now wewould like to know how fast it will evaporate. Even though we have used only a

42-5

rough analysis so far as the evaporation part of it is concerned, the number ofvapor molecules arriving was not done so badly, aside from the unknown factor ofreﬂection coeﬃcient. So therefore we may use the fact that the number that areleaving, at equilibrium, is the same as the number that arrive. True, the vaporis being swept away and so the molecules are only coming out, but if the vaporwere left alone, it would attain the equilibrium density at which the number thatcome back would equal the number that are evaporating. Therefore, we caneasily see that the number that are coming oﬀ the surface per second is equal tothe unknown reﬂection coeﬃcient R times the number that would come downto the surface per second were the vapor still there, because that is how manywould balance the evaporation at equilibrium:

Ne = nvR = (vR/Va)e−W/kT .

(42.5)

Of course, the number of molecules that hit the liquid from the vapor is easy tocalculate, since we do not need to know as much about the forces as we do whenwe are worrying about how they get to escape through the liquid surface; it ismuch easier to make the argument the other way.

42-2 Thermionic emissionWe may give another example of a very practical situation that is similar tothe evaporation of a liquid—so similar that it is not worth making a separateanalysis. It is essentially the same problem. In a radio tube there is a source ofelectrons, namely a heated tungsten ﬁlament, and a positively charged plate toattract the electrons. Any electron that escapes from the surface of the tungstenis immediately swept away to the plate. That is our ideal「pump,」which is「pumping」the electrons away all the time. Now the question is: How manyelectrons per second can we get out of a piece of tungsten, and how does thatnumber vary with temperature? The answer to that problem is the same as (42.5),because it turns out that in a piece of metal, electrons are attracted to the ions,or to atoms, of the metal. They are attracted, if we may say it crudely, to themetal. In order to get an electron out of a piece of metal, it takes a certainamount of energy or work to pull it out. This work varies with the diﬀerent kindsof metal. In fact, it varies even with the character of the surface of a given kindof metal, but the total work may be a few electron volts, which, incidentally, istypical of the energy involved in chemical reactions. We can remember the latter

42-6

fact by remembering that the voltage in a chemical cell like a ﬂashlight battery,which is produced by chemical reactions, is about one volt.

How can we ﬁnd out how many electrons come out per second? It would bequite diﬃcult to analyze the eﬀects on the electrons going out; it is easier toanalyze the situation the other way. So, we could start out by imagining thatwe did not draw the electrons away, and that the electrons were like a gas, andcould come back to the metal. Then there would be a certain density of electronsat equilibrium which would, of course, be given by exactly the same formulaas (42.1), where Va is the volume per electron in the metal, roughly, and W isequal to qeφ, where φ is the so-called work function, or the voltage needed to pullan electron oﬀ the surface. This would tell us how many electrons would have tobe in the surrounding space and striking the metal in order to balance the onesthat are coming out. And thus it is easy to calculate how many are coming outif we sweep away all of them, because the number that are coming out is exactlyequal to the number that would be going in with the above density of electron「vapor.」In other words, the answer is that the current of electricity that comesin per unit area is equal to the charge on each times the number that arrive persecond per unit area, which is the number per unit volume times the velocity, aswe have seen many times:

I = qenv = (qev/Va)e−qeφ/kT .

(42.6)Now one electron volt corresponds to kT at a temperature of 11,600 degrees. Theﬁlament of the tube may be operating at a temperature of, say, 1100 degrees, sothe exponential factor is something like e−10; when we change the temperature alittle bit, the exponential factor changes a lot. Thus, again, the central featureof the formula is the e−qeφ/kT . As a matter of fact, the factor in front is quitewrong—it turns out that the behavior of electrons in a metal is not correctlydescribed by the classical theory, but by quantum mechanics, but this onlychanges the factor in front a little. Actually, no one has ever been able to getthe thing straightened out very well, even though many people have used thehigh-class quantum-mechanical theory for their calculations. The big problem is,does W change slightly with temperature? If it does, one cannot distinguish aW changing slowly with temperature from a diﬀerent coeﬃcient in front. Thatis, if W changed linearly, say, with temperature, so that W = W0 + αkT, thenwe would have

e−W/kT = e−(W0+αkT )/kT = e−αe−W0/kT .

42-7

Thus a linearly temperature-dependent W is equivalent to a shifted「constant.」It is really quite diﬃcult and usually fruitless to try to obtain the coeﬃcient inthe front accurately.

42-3 Thermal ionizationNow we go on to another example of the same idea; always the same idea.This has to do with ionization. Suppose that in a gas we have a whole lot ofatoms which are in the neutral state, say, but the gas is hot and the atoms canbecome ionized. We would like to know how many ions there are in a givencircumstance if we have a certain density of atoms per unit volume at a certaintemperature. Again we consider a box in which there are N atoms which canhold electrons. (If an electron has come oﬀ an atom, it is called an ion, and ifthe atom is neutral, we simply call it an atom.) Then suppose that, at any givenmoment, the number of neutral atoms is na, the number of ions is ni, and thenumber of electrons is ne, all per unit volume. The problem is: What is therelationship of these three numbers?In the ﬁrst place, we have two conditions or constraints on the numbers. Forinstance, as we vary diﬀerent conditions, like the temperature and so on, na + niwould remain constant, because this would be simply the number N of atomicnuclei that are in the box. If we keep the number of nuclei per unit volumeﬁxed, and change, say, the temperature, then as the ionization proceeded someatoms would turn to ions, but the total number of atoms plus ions would beunchanged. That is, na + ni = N. Another condition is that if the entire gasis to be electrically neutral (and if we neglect double or triple ionization), thatmeans that the number of ions is equal to the number of electrons at all times,or ni = ne. These are subsidiary equations that simply express the conservationof charge and the conservation of atoms.These equations are true, and we ultimately will use them when we consider areal problem. But we want to obtain another relationship between the quantities.We can do this as follows. We again use the idea that it takes a certain amountof energy to lift the electron out of the atom, which we call the ionization energy,and we would write it as W, in order to make all of the formulas look the same.So we let W equal the energy needed to pull an electron out of an atom andmake an ion. Now we again say that the number of free electrons per unit volumein the「vapor」is equal to the number of bound electrons per unit volume inthe atoms, times e to the minus the energy diﬀerence between being bound and

42-8

being free, over kT. That is the basic equation again. How can we write it? Thenumber of free electrons per unit volume would, of course, be ne, because that isthe deﬁnition of ne. Now what about the number of electrons per unit volumethat are bound to atoms? The total number of places that we could put theelectrons is apparently na + ni, and we will suppose that when they are boundeach one is bound within a certain volume Va. So the total amount of volumewhich is available to electrons which would be bound is (na + ni)Va, so we mightwant to write our formula as

ne =

na

(na + ni)Va

e−W/kT .

The formula is wrong, however, in one essential feature, which is the following:when an electron is already on an atom, another electron cannot come to thatvolume anymore! In other words, all the volumes of all the possible sites are notreally available for the one electron which is trying to make up its mind whetheror not to be in the vapor or in the condensed position, because in this problemthere is an extra feature that when one electron is where another electron is, it isnot allowed to go—it is repelled. For that reason, it comes out that we shouldcount only that part of the volume which is available for an electron to sit on ornot. That is, those which are already occupied do not count in the total availablevolume, but the only volume which is allowed is that of the ions, where there arevacant places for the electron to go. Then, in those circumstances, we ﬁnd that anicer way to write our formula is

nenina

= 1Va

e−W/kT .

(42.7)

This formula is called the Saha ionization equation. Now let us see if we canunderstand qualitatively why a formula like this is right, by arguing about thekinetic things that are happening.

First, every once in a while an electron comes to an ion and they combineto make an atom. And also, every once in a while, an atom gets into a collisionand breaks up into an ion and an electron. Now those two rates must be equal.How fast do electrons and ions ﬁnd each other? The rate is certainly increased ifthe number of electrons per unit volume is increased. It is also increased if thenumber of ions per unit volume is increased. That is, the total rate at whichrecombination is occurring is certainly proportional to the number of electronstimes the number of ions. Now the total rate at which ionization is occurring

42-9

due to collisions must be dependent linearly on how many atoms there are toionize. And so the rates will balance when there is some relationship betweenthe product neni and the number of atoms, na. The fact that this relationshiphappens to be given by this particular formula, where W is the ionization energy,is of course a little bit more information, but we can easily understand thatthe formula would necessarily involve the concentrations of the electrons, ions,and atoms in the combination neni/na to produce a constant independent ofthe n’s, and dependent only on temperature, the atomic cross sections, and otherconstant factors.

We may also note that, since the equation involves the numbers per unitvolume, if we were to do two experiments with a given total number N ofatoms plus ions, that is, a certain ﬁxed number of nuclei, but using boxes withdiﬀerent volumes, the n’s would all be smaller in the larger box. But since theratio neni/na stays the same, the total number of electrons and ions must begreater in the larger box. To see this, suppose that there are N nuclei inside a boxof volume V , and that a fraction f of them are ionized. Then ne = f N/V = ni,and na = (1 − f)N/V . Then our equation becomes

f 21 − f

NV

= e−W/kTVa

.

(42.8)

In other words, if we take a smaller and smaller density of atoms, or make thevolume of the container bigger and bigger, the fraction f of electrons and ionsmust increase. That ionization, just from「expansion」as the density goes down,is the reason why we believe that at very low densities, such as in the coldspace between the stars, there may be ions present, even though we might notunderstand it from the point of view of the available energy. Although it takesmany, many kT of energy to make them, there are ions present.

Why can there be ions present when there is so much space around, while ifwe increase the density, the ions tend to disappear? Answer: Consider an atom.Every once in a while, light, or another atom, or an ion, or whatever it is thatmaintains thermal equilibrium, strikes it. Very rarely, because it takes such aterriﬁc amount of excess energy, an electron comes oﬀ and an ion is left. Nowthat electron, if the space is enormous, wanders and wanders and does not comenear anything for years, perhaps. But once in a very great while, it does comeback to an ion and they combine to make an atom. So the rate at which electronsare coming out from the atoms is very slow. But if the volume is enormous, an

42-10

electron which has escaped takes so long to ﬁnd another ion to recombine withthat its probability of recombination is very, very small; thus, in spite of the largeexcess energy needed, there may be a reasonable number of electrons.

nAnBnAB

= ce−W/kT .

42-4 Chemical kineticsThe same situation that we have just called「ionization」is also found ina chemical reaction. For instance, if two objects A and B combine into acompound AB, then if we think about it for a while we see that AB is what wehave called an atom, B is what we call an electron, and A is what we call an ion.With these substitutions the equations of equilibrium are exactly the same inform:

(42.9)This formula, of course, is not exact, since the「constant」c depends on how muchvolume is allowed for the A and B to combine, and so on, but by thermodynamicarguments one can identify what the meaning of the W in the exponential factoris, and it turns out that it is very close to the energy needed in the reaction.Suppose that we tried to understand this formula as a result of collisions,much in the way that we understood the evaporation formula, by arguing abouthow many electrons came oﬀ and how many of them came back per unit time.Suppose that A and B combine in a collision every once in a while to form acompound AB. And suppose that the compound AB is a complicated moleculewhich jiggles around and is hit by other molecules, and from time to time it getsenough energy to explode and break up again into A and B.Now it actually turns out, in chemical reactions, that if the atoms cometogether with too small an energy, even though energy may be released in thereaction A + B → AB, the fact that A and B may touch each other does notnecessarily make the reaction start. It usually is required that the collision be

Fig. 42-1. The energy relationship for the reaction A + B → AB.

42-11

rather hard, in fact, to get the reaction to go at all—a「soft」collision between Aand B may not do it, even though energy may be released in the process. Solet us suppose that it is very common in chemical reactions that, in order for Aand B to form AB, they cannot just hit each other, but they have to hit eachother with suﬃcient energy. This energy is called the activation energy—theenergy needed to「activate」the reaction. Call A∗ the activation energy, theexcess energy needed in a collision in order that the reaction may really occur.Then the rate Rf at which A and B produce AB would involve the number ofatoms of A times the number of atoms of B, times the rate at which a singleatom would strike a certain cross section σAB, times a factor e−A∗/kT which isthe probability that they have enough energy:

Rf = nAnBvσABe−A∗/kT .

(42.10)Now we have to ﬁnd the opposite rate, Rr. There is a certain chance that ABwill ﬂy apart. In order to ﬂy apart, it not only must have the energy W which itneeds in order to get apart at all but, just as it was hard for A and B to cometogether, so there is a kind of hill that A and B have to climb over to get apartagain; they must have not only enough energy just to get ready to pull apart,but a certain excess. It is like climbing a hill to get into a deep valley; they haveto climb the hill coming in and they have to climb out of the valley and then overthe hill coming back (Fig. 42-1). Thus the rate at which AB goes to A and Bwill be proportional to the number nAB that are present, times e−(W +A∗)/kT :(42.11)The c0 will involve the volume of atoms and the rate of collisions, which wecan work out, as we did the case of evaporation, with areas and times andthicknesses; but we shall not do this. The main feature of interest to us is thatwhen these two rates are equal, the ratio of them is equal to unity. This tellsus that nAnB/nAB = ce−W/kT , as before, where c involves the cross sections,velocities, and other factors independent of the n’s.The interesting thing is that the rate of the reaction also varies as e−const/kT ,although the constant is not the same as that which governs the concentrations;the activation energy A∗ is quite diﬀerent from the energy W. W governs theproportions of A, B, and AB that we have in equilibrium, but if we want to knowhow fast A + B goes to AB, that is not a question of equilibrium, and here a

Rr = c0nABe−(W +A∗)/kT .

42-12

diﬀerent energy, the activation energy, governs the rate of reaction through anexponential factor.Furthermore, A∗ is not a fundamental constant like W. Suppose that at thesurface of the wall—or at some other place—A and B could temporarily stickthere in such a way that they could combine more easily. In other words, we mightﬁnd a「tunnel」through the hill, or perhaps a lower hill. By the conservationof energy, when we are all ﬁnished we have still made AB out of A and B,so the energy diﬀerence W will be quite independent of the way the reactionoccurred, but the activation energy A∗ will depend very much on the way thereaction occurs. This is why the rates of chemical reactions are very sensitive tooutside conditions. We can change the rate by putting in a surface of a diﬀerentkind, we can put it in a「diﬀerent barrel」and it will go at a diﬀerent rate, ifit depends on the nature of the surface. Or if we put in a third kind of objectit may change the rate very much; some things produce enormous changes inrate simply by changing the A∗ a little bit—they are called catalysts. A reactionmight practically not occur at all because A∗ is too big at the given temperature,but when we put in this special stuﬀ, the catalyst, then the reaction goes veryfast indeed, because A∗ is reduced.Incidentally, there is some trouble with such a reaction, A plus B, makingAB, because we cannot conserve both energy and momentum when we try to puttwo objects together to make one that is more stable. Therefore, we need at leasta third object C, so the actual reaction is much more complicated. The forwardrate would involve the product nAnBnC, and it might seem that our formula isgoing wrong, but no! When we look at the rate at which AB goes the other way,we ﬁnd that it also needs to collide with C, so there is an nABnC in the reverserate; the nC’s cancel out in the formula for the equilibrium concentrations. Thelaw of equilibrium, (42.9), which we ﬁrst wrote down is absolutely guaranteed tobe true, no matter what the mechanism of the reaction may be!

42-5 Einstein’s laws of radiationWe now turn to an interesting analogous situation having to do with theblackbody radiation law. In the last chapter we worked out the distribution lawfor the radiation in a cavity the way Planck did, considering the radiation froman oscillator. The oscillator had to have a certain mean energy, and since it wasoscillating, it would radiate and would keep pumping radiation into the cavityuntil it piled up enough radiation to balance the absorption and emission. In

42-13

that way we found that the intensity of radiation at frequency ω was given bythe formula

ω3 dω

π2c2(eω/kT − 1) .

I(ω) dω =

(42.12)

This result involved the assumption that the oscillator which was generatingthe radiation had deﬁnite, equally spaced energy levels. We did not say thatlight had to be a photon or anything like that. There was no discussion abouthow, when an atom goes from one level to another, the energy must come outin one unit of energy, ω, in the form of light. Planck’s original idea was thatthe matter was quantized but not the light: material oscillators cannot take upjust any energy, but have to take it in lumps. Furthermore, the trouble with thederivation is that it was partially classical. We calculated the rate of radiationfrom an oscillator according to classical physics; then we turned around andsaid,「No, this oscillator has a lot of energy levels.」So gradually, in order toﬁnd the right result, the completely quantum-mechanical result, there was aslow development which culminated in the quantum mechanics of 1927. But inthe meantime, there was an attempt by Einstein to convert Planck’s viewpointthat only oscillators of matter were quantized, to the idea that light was reallyphotons and could be considered in a certain way as particles with energy ω.Furthermore, Bohr had pointed out that any system of atoms has energy levels,but they are not necessarily equally spaced like Planck’s oscillator. And so itbecame necessary to rederive or at least rediscuss the radiation law from a morecompletely quantum-mechanical viewpoint.

Einstein assumed that Planck’s ﬁnal formula was right, and he used thatformula to obtain some new information, previously unknown, about the inter-action of radiation with matter. His discussion went as follows: Consider anytwo of the many energy levels of an atom, say the mth level and the nth level(Fig. 42-2). Now Einstein proposed that when such an atom has light of the rightfrequency shining on it, it can absorb that photon of light and make a transitionfrom state n to state m, and that the probability that this occurs per second

depends upon the two levels, of course, but is proportional to how intense thelight is that is shining on it. Let us call the proportionality constant Bnm, merelyto remind us that this is not a universal constant of nature, but depends on theparticular pair of levels: some levels are easy to excite; some levels are hard toexcite. Now what is the formula going to be for the rate of emission from m to n?Einstein proposed that this must have two parts to it. First, even if there wereno light present, there would be some chance that an atom in an excited statewould fall to a lower state, emitting a photon; this we call spontaneous emission.It is analogous to the idea that an oscillator with a certain amount of energy,even in classical physics, does not keep that energy, but loses it by radiation.Thus the analog of spontaneous radiation of a classical system is that if the atomis in an excited state there is a certain probability Amn, which depends on thelevels again, for it to go down from m to n, and this probability is independentof whether light is shining on the atom or not. But then Einstein went further,and by comparison with the classical theory and by other arguments, concludedthat emission was also inﬂuenced by the presence of light—that when light ofthe right frequency is shining on an atom, it has an increased rate of emitting aphoton that is proportional to the intensity of the light, with a proportionalityconstant Bmn. Later, if we deduce that this coeﬃcient is zero, then we will havefound that Einstein was wrong. Of course we will ﬁnd he was right.Thus Einstein assumed that there are three kinds of processes: an absorptionproportional to the intensity of light, an emission proportional to the inten-sity of light, called induced emission or sometimes stimulated emission, and aspontaneous emission independent of light.

Now suppose that we have, in equilibrium at temperature T, a certain numberof atoms Nn in the state n and another number Nm in the state m. Then thetotal number of atoms that are going from n to m is the number that are in thestate n times the rate per second that, if one is in n, it goes up to m. So we havea formula for the number that are going from n to m per second:

Rn→m = NnBnmI(ω).

(42.13)

The number that will go from m to n is expressed in the same manner, as thenumber Nm that are in m, times the chance per second that each one goes downto n. This time our expression is

Rm→n = Nm[Amn + BmnI(ω)].

(42.14)

42-15

Now we shall suppose that in thermal equilibrium the number of atoms going upmust equal the number coming down. That is one way, at least, in which thenumber will be sure to stay constant in each level.* So we take these two rates tobe equal at equilibrium. But we have one other piece of information: we know howlarge Nm is compared with Nn—the ratio of those two is e−(Em−En)/kT . NowEinstein assumed that the only light which is eﬀective in making the transitionfrom n to m is the light which has the frequency corresponding to the energydiﬀerence, so Em − En = ω in all our formulas. Thus

(42.15)Thus if we set the two rates equal: NnBnmI(ω) = Nm[Amn + BmnI(ω)], and

Nm = Nne−ω/kT .

divide by Nm, we get

BnmI(ω)e

ω/kT = Amn + BmnI(ω).

From this equation, we can calculate I(ω). It is simply

I(ω) =

Amn

Bnmeω/kT − Bmn

.

(42.16)

(42.17)

But Planck has already told us that the formula must be (42.12). Thereforewe can deduce something: First, that Bnm must equal Bmn, since otherwise weω/kT − 1). So Einstein discovered some things that he didcannot get the (enot know how to calculate, namely that the induced emission probability and theabsorption probability must be equal. This is interesting. And furthermore, inorder for (42.17) and (42.12) to agree,

Amn/Bmn

must be

ω3/π2c2.

(42.18)So if we know, for instance, the absorption rate for a given level, we can deducethe spontaneous emission rate and the induced emission rate, or any combination.This is as far as Einstein or anyone else could go using such arguments. Toactually compute the absolute spontaneous emission rate or the other rates forany speciﬁc atomic transition, of course, requires a knowledge of the machineryof the atom, called quantum electrodynamics, which was not discovered untileleven years later. This work of Einstein was done in 1916.

* This is not the only way one can arrange to keep the numbers of atoms in the various levelsconstant, but it is the way it actually works. That every process must, in thermal equilibrium,be balanced by its exact opposite is called the principle of detailed balancing.

The possibility of induced emission has, today, found interesting applications.If there is light present, it will tend to induce the downward transition. Thetransition then adds its ω to the available light energy, if there were some atomssitting in the upper state. Now we can arrange, by some nonthermal method, tohave a gas in which the number in the state m is very much greater than thenumber in the state n. This is far out of equilibrium, and so is not given by theformula e−ω/kT , which is for equilibrium. We can even arrange it so that thenumber in the upper state is very large, while the number in the lower state ispractically zero. Then light which has the frequency corresponding to the energydiﬀerence Em − En will not be strongly absorbed, because there are not manyatoms in state n to absorb it. On the other hand, when that light is present, itwill induce the emission from this upper state! So, if we had a lot of atoms inthe upper state, there would be a sort of chain reaction, in which, the momentthe atoms began to emit, more would be caused to emit, and the whole lot ofthem would dump down together. This is what is called a laser, or, in the caseof the far infrared, a maser.

Various tricks can be used to obtain the atoms in state m. There may behigher levels to which the atoms can get if we shine in a strong beam of light ofhigh frequency. From these high levels, they may trickle down, emitting variousphotons, until they all get stuck in the state m. If they tend to stay in thestate m without emitting, the state is called metastable. And then they areall dumped down together by induced emissions. One more technical point—ifwe put this system in an ordinary box, it would radiate in so many diﬀerentdirections spontaneously, compared with the induced eﬀect, that we would stillbe in trouble. But we can enhance the induced eﬀect, increase its eﬃciency, by

42-17

putting nearly perfect mirrors on each side of the box, so that the light which isemitted gets another chance, and another chance, and another chance, to inducemore emission. Although the mirrors are almost one hundred percent reﬂecting,there is a slight amount of transmission of the mirror, and a little light gets out.In the end, of course, from the conservation of energy, all the light goes out ina nice uniform straight direction which makes the strong light beams that arepossible today with lasers.
