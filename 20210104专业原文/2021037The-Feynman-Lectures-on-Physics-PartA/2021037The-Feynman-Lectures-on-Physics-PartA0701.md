The Theory of Gravitation

7-1 Planetary motionsIn this chapter we shall discuss one of the most far-reaching generalizations ofthe human mind. While we are admiring the human mind, we should take sometime oﬀ to stand in awe of a nature that could follow with such completenessand generality such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation. Whatis this law of gravitation? It is that every object in the universe attracts everyother object with a force which for any two bodies is proportional to the massof each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between them. Thisstatement can be expressed mathematically by the equation

F = G

mm0r2 .

If to this we add the fact that an object responds to a force by accelerating inthe direction of the force by an amount that is inversely proportional to the massof the object, we shall have said everything required, for a suﬃciently talentedmathematician could then deduce all the consequences of these two principles.However, since you are not assumed to be suﬃciently talented yet, we shalldiscuss the consequences in more detail, and not just leave you with only thesetwo bare principles. We shall brieﬂy relate the story of the discovery of thelaw of gravitation and discuss some of its consequences, its eﬀects on history,the mysteries that such a law entails, and some reﬁnements of the law madeby Einstein; we shall also discuss the relationships of the law to the other lawsof physics. All this cannot be done in one chapter, but these subjects will betreated in due time in subsequent chapters.

The story begins with the ancients observing the motions of planets amongthe stars, and ﬁnally deducing that they went around the sun, a fact that wasrediscovered later by Copernicus. Exactly how the planets went around the sun,

7-1

with exactly what motion, took a little more work to discover. In the beginningof the ﬁfteenth century there were great debates as to whether they really wentaround the sun or not. Tycho Brahe had an idea that was diﬀerent from anythingproposed by the ancients: his idea was that these debates about the nature of themotions of the planets would best be resolved if the actual positions of the planetsin the sky were measured suﬃciently accurately. If measurement showed exactlyhow the planets moved, then perhaps it would be possible to establish one oranother viewpoint. This was a tremendous idea—that to ﬁnd something out, it isbetter to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophicalarguments. Pursuing this idea, Tycho Brahe studied the positions of the planetsfor many years in his observatory on the island of Hven, near Copenhagen. Hemade voluminous tables, which were then studied by the mathematician Kepler,after Tycho’s death. Kepler discovered from the data some very beautiful andremarkable, but simple, laws regarding planetary motion.

7-2 Kepler’s lawsFirst of all, Kepler found that each planet goes around the sun in a curvecalled an ellipse, with the sun at a focus of the ellipse. An ellipse is not just anoval, but is a very speciﬁc and precise curve that can be obtained by using twotacks, one at each focus, a loop of string, and a pencil; more mathematically, itis the locus of all points the sum of whose distances from two ﬁxed points (thefoci) is a constant. Or, if you will, it is a foreshortened circle (Fig. 7-1).

Fig. 7-1. An ellipse.

Kepler’s second observation was that the planets do not go around the sun ata uniform speed, but move faster when they are nearer the sun and more slowlywhen they are farther from the sun, in precisely this way: Suppose a planet

is observed at any two successive times, let us say a week apart, and that theradius vector* is drawn to the planet for each observed position. The orbital arctraversed by the planet during the week, and the two radius vectors, bound acertain plane area, the shaded area shown in Fig. 7-2. If two similar observationsare made a week apart, at a part of the orbit farther from the sun (where theplanet moves more slowly), the similarly bounded area is exactly the same as inthe ﬁrst case. So, in accordance with the second law, the orbital speed of eachplanet is such that the radius「sweeps out」equal areas in equal times.

Finally, a third law was discovered by Kepler much later; this law is of adiﬀerent category from the other two, because it deals not with only a singleplanet, but relates one planet to another. This law says that when the orbitalperiod and orbit size of any two planets are compared, the periods are proportionalto the 3/2 power of the orbit size. In this statement the period is the time intervalit takes a planet to go completely around its orbit, and the size is measured bythe length of the greatest diameter of the elliptical orbit, technically known asthe major axis. More simply, if the planets went in circles, as they nearly do, thetime required to go around the circle would be proportional to the 3/2 power ofthe diameter (or radius). Thus Kepler’s three laws are:

I. Each planet moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sun at one focus.II. The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in

equal intervals of time.

III. The squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional to the cubes

of the semimajor axes of their respective orbits: T ∝ a3/2.

* A radius vector is a line drawn from the sun to any point in a planet’s orbit.

7-3 Development of dynamics

While Kepler was discovering these laws, Galileo was studying the laws ofmotion. The problem was, what makes the planets go around? (In those days,one of the theories proposed was that the planets went around because behindthem were invisible angels, beating their wings and driving the planets forward.You will see that this theory is now modiﬁed! It turns out that in order to keep theplanets going around, the invisible angels must ﬂy in a diﬀerent direction and theyhave no wings. Otherwise, it is a somewhat similar theory!) Galileo discovered avery remarkable fact about motion, which was essential for understanding theselaws. That is the principle of inertia—if something is moving, with nothingtouching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at auniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do notknow, but that is the way it is.)

Newton modiﬁed this idea, saying that the only way to change the motionof a body is to use force. If the body speeds up, a force has been applied inthe direction of motion. On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a newdirection, a force has been applied sideways. Newton thus added the idea thata force is needed to change the speed or the direction of motion of a body. Forexample, if a stone is attached to a string and is whirling around in a circle, ittakes a force to keep it in the circle. We have to pull on the string. In fact, thelaw is that the acceleration produced by the force is inversely proportional to themass, or the force is proportional to the mass times the acceleration. The moremassive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given acceleration.(The mass can be measured by putting other stones on the end of the same stringand making them go around the same circle at the same speed. In this way itis found that more or less force is required, the more massive object requiringmore force.) The brilliant idea resulting from these considerations is that notangential force is needed to keep a planet in its orbit (the angels do not have toﬂy tangentially) because the planet would coast in that direction anyway. If therewere nothing at all to disturb it, the planet would go oﬀ in a straight line. Butthe actual motion deviates from the line on which the body would have gone ifthere were no force, the deviation being essentially at right angles to the motion,not in the direction of the motion. In other words, because of the principle ofinertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet around the sun is nota force around the sun but toward the sun. (If there is a force toward the sun,the sun might be the angel, of course!)

7-4

7-4 Newton’s law of gravitationFrom his better understanding of the theory of motion, Newton appreciatedthat the sun could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion ofthe planets. Newton proved to himself (and perhaps we shall be able to prove itsoon) that the very fact that equal areas are swept out in equal times is a precisesign post of the proposition that all deviations are precisely radial—that the lawof areas is a direct consequence of the idea that all of the forces are directedexactly toward the sun.Next, by analyzing Kepler’s third law it is possible to show that the fartheraway the planet, the weaker the forces. If two planets at diﬀerent distancesfrom the sun are compared, the analysis shows that the forces are inverselyproportional to the squares of the respective distances. With the combinationof the two laws, Newton concluded that there must be a force, inversely as thesquare of the distance, directed in a line between the two objects.

Being a man of considerable feeling for generalities, Newton supposed, ofcourse, that this relationship applied more generally than just to the sun holdingthe planets. It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter hadmoons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the earth, andNewton felt certain that each planet held its moons with a force. He already knewof the force holding us on the earth, so he proposed that this was a universalforce—that everything pulls everything else.The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the「same」as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the distance. Ifan object on the surface of the earth falls 16 feet in the ﬁrst second after it isreleased from rest, how far does the moon fall in the same time? We might saythat the moon does not fall at all. But if there were no force on the moon, itwould go oﬀ in a straight line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it reallyfalls in from where it would have been if there were no force at all. We cancalculate from the radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about 240,000 miles) andhow long it takes to go around the earth (approximately 29 days), how far themoon moves in its orbit in 1 second, and can then calculate how far it falls inone second.* This distance turns out to be roughly 1/20 of an inch in a second.That ﬁts very well with the inverse square law, because the earth’s radius is4000 miles, and if something which is 4000 miles from the center of the earth

* That is, how far the circle of the moon’s orbit falls below the straight line tangent to it at

the point where the moon was one second before.

7-5

falls 16 feet in a second, something 240,000 miles, or 60 times as far away, shouldfall only 1/3600 of 16 feet, which also is roughly 1/20 of an inch. Wishing toput this theory of gravitation to a test by similar calculations, Newton made hiscalculations very carefully and found a discrepancy so large that he regarded thetheory as contradicted by facts, and did not publish his results. Six years latera new measurement of the size of the earth showed that the astronomers hadbeen using an incorrect distance to the moon. When Newton heard of this, hemade the calculation again, with the corrected ﬁgures, and obtained beautifulagreement.

This idea that the moon「falls」is somewhat confusing, because, as you see,it does not come any closer. The idea is suﬃciently interesting to merit furtherexplanation: the moon falls in the sense that it falls away from the straight linethat it would pursue if there were no forces. Let us take an example on the surfaceof the earth. An object released near the earth’s surface will fall 16 feet in theﬁrst second. An object shot out horizontally will also fall 16 feet; even though itis moving horizontally, it still falls the same 16 feet in the same time. Figure 7-3shows an apparatus which demonstrates this. On the horizontal track is a ballwhich is going to be driven forward a little distance away. At the same height isa ball which is going to fall vertically, and there is an electrical switch arrangedso that at the moment the ﬁrst ball leaves the track, the second ball is released.That they come to the same depth at the same time is witnessed by the factthat they collide in midair. An object like a bullet, shot horizontally, might goa long way in one second—perhaps 2000 feet—but it will still fall 16 feet if itis aimed horizontally. What happens if we shoot a bullet faster and faster? Donot forget that the earth’s surface is curved. If we shoot it fast enough, then

horizontal motions.

Fig. 7-4. Acceleration toward the center of a circular path. Fromplane geometry, x/S = (2R − S)/x ≈ 2R/x, where R is the radius ofthe earth, 4000 miles; x is the distance「travelled horizontally」in onesecond; and S is the distance「fallen」in one second (16 feet).

when it falls 16 feet it may be at just the same height above the ground as itwas before. How can that be? It still falls, but the earth curves away, so it falls「around」the earth. The question is, how far does it have to go in one second sothat the earth is 16 feet below the horizon? In Fig. 7-4 we see the earth withits 4000-mile radius, and the tangential, straight line path that the bullet wouldtake if there were no force. Now, if we use one of those wonderful theorems ingeometry, which says that our tangent is the mean proportional between the twoparts of the diameter cut by an equal chord, we see that the horizontal distancetravelled is the mean proportional between the 16 feet fallen and the 8000-milediameter of the earth. The square root of (16/5280) × 8000 comes out very closeto 5 miles. Thus we see that if the bullet moves at 5 miles a second, it then willcontinue to fall toward the earth at the same rate of 16 feet each second, but willnever get any closer because the earth keeps curving away from it. Thus it wasthat Mr. Gagarin maintained himself in space while going 25,000 miles aroundthe earth at approximately 5 miles per second. (He took a little longer becausehe was a little higher.)

Any great discovery of a new law is useful only if we can take more out thanwe put in. Now, Newton used the second and third of Kepler’s laws to deducehis law of gravitation. What did he predict? First, his analysis of the moon’smotion was a prediction because it connected the falling of objects on the earth’ssurface with that of the moon. Second, the question is, is the orbit an ellipse?We shall see in a later chapter how it is possible to calculate the motion exactly,

7-7

and indeed one can prove that it should be an ellipse,* so no extra fact is neededto explain Kepler’s ﬁrst law. Thus Newton made his ﬁrst powerful prediction.The law of gravitation explains many phenomena not previously understood.For example, the pull of the moon on the earth causes the tides, hitherto mys-terious. The moon pulls the water up under it and makes the tides—peoplehad thought of that before, but they were not as clever as Newton, and so theythought there ought to be only one tide during the day. The reasoning was thatthe moon pulls the water up under it, making a high tide and a low tide, and sincethe earth spins underneath, that makes the tide at one station go up and downevery 24 hours. Actually the tide goes up and down in 12 hours. Another schoolof thought claimed that the high tide should be on the other side of the earthbecause, so they argued, the moon pulls the earth away from the water! Both ofthese theories are wrong. It actually works like this: the pull of the moon for theearth and for the water is「balanced」at the center. But the water which is closerto the moon is pulled more than the average and the water which is farther awayfrom it is pulled less than the average. Furthermore, the water can ﬂow while themore rigid earth cannot. The true picture is a combination of these two things.What do we mean by「balanced」? What balances? If the moon pulls thewhole earth toward it, why doesn’t the earth fall right「up」to the moon? Becausethe earth does the same trick as the moon, it goes in a circle around a pointwhich is inside the earth but not at its center. The moon does not just go aroundthe earth, the earth and the moon both go around a central position, each fallingtoward this common position, as shown in Fig. 7-5. This motion around the

* The proof is not given in this course.

7-8

common center is what balances the fall of each. So the earth is not going in astraight line either; it travels in a circle. The water on the far side is「unbalanced」because the moon’s attraction there is weaker than it is at the center of theearth, where it just balances the「centrifugal force.」The result of this imbalanceis that the water rises up, away from the center of the earth. On the near side,the attraction from the moon is stronger, and the imbalance is in the oppositedirection in space, but again away from the center of the earth. The net result isthat we get two tidal bulges.

7-5 Universal gravitationWhat else can we understand when we understand gravity? Everyone knowsthe earth is round. Why is the earth round? That is easy; it is due to gravitation.The earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attractseverything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can! If we goeven further, the earth is not exactly a sphere because it is rotating, and thisbrings in centrifugal eﬀects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator. Itturns out that the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape forthe ellipse. We can thus deduce that the sun, the moon, and the earth should be(nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation.

What else can you do with the law of gravitation? If we look at the moonsof Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move around thatplanet. Incidentally, there was once a certain diﬃculty with the moons of Jupiterthat is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully byRoemer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule,and sometimes behind. (One can ﬁnd their schedules by waiting a very long timeand ﬁnding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.)Now they were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and theywere behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have beena very diﬃcult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation—it wouldhave been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no otherexplanation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it isjust wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: ittakes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes lightto travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the timeis a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is whymoons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending

7-9

on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showedthat light does not travel instantaneously, and furnished the ﬁrst estimate of thespeed of light. This was done in 1656.

If all of the planets push and pull on each other, the force which controls,let us say, Jupiter in going around the sun is not just the force from the sun;there is also a pull from, say, Saturn. This force is not really strong, since thesun is much more massive than Saturn, but there is some pull, so the orbitof Jupiter should not be a perfect ellipse, and it is not; it is slightly oﬀ, and「wobbles」around the correct elliptical orbit. Such a motion is a little morecomplicated. Attempts were made to analyze the motions of Jupiter, Saturn,and Uranus on the basis of the law of gravitation. The eﬀects of each of theseplanets on each other were calculated to see whether or not the tiny deviationsand irregularities in these motions could be completely understood from thisone law. Lo and behold, for Jupiter and Saturn, all was well, but Uranus was「weird.」It behaved in a very peculiar manner. It was not travelling in an exactellipse, but that was understandable, because of the attractions of Jupiter andSaturn. But even if allowance were made for these attractions, Uranus still wasnot going right, so the laws of gravitation were in danger of being overturned,a possibility that could not be ruled out. Two men, Adams and Le Verrier, inEngland and France, independently, arrived at another possibility: perhaps thereis another planet, dark and invisible, which men had not seen. This planet, N,could pull on Uranus. They calculated where such a planet would have to be inorder to cause the observed perturbations. They sent messages to the respectiveobservatories, saying,「Gentlemen, point your telescope to such and such a place,and you will see a new planet.」It often depends on with whom you are workingas to whether they pay any attention to you or not. They did pay attention toLe Verrier; they looked, and there planet N was! The other observatory thenalso looked very quickly in the next few days and saw it too.This discovery shows that Newton’s laws are absolutely right in the solarsystem; but do they extend beyond the relatively small distances of the nearestplanets? The ﬁrst test lies in the question, do stars attract each other as well asplanets? We have deﬁnite evidence that they do in the double stars. Figure 7-6shows a double star—two stars very close together (there is also a third star inthe picture so that we will know that the photograph was not turned). The starsare also shown as they appeared several years later. We see that, relative to the「ﬁxed」star, the axis of the pair has rotated, i.e., the two stars are going aroundeach other. Do they rotate according to Newton’s laws? Careful measurements

Fig. 7-7. Orbit of Sirius B with respect to Sirius A.

7-11

of the relative positions of one such double star system are shown in Fig. 7-7.There we see a beautiful ellipse, the measures starting in 1862 and going all theway around to 1904 (by now it must have gone around once more). Everythingcoincides with Newton’s laws, except that the star Sirius A is not at the focus.Why should that be? Because the plane of the ellipse is not in the「plane of thesky.」We are not looking at right angles to the orbit plane, and when an ellipse isviewed at a tilt, it remains an ellipse but the focus is no longer at the same place.Thus we can analyze double stars, moving about each other, according to therequirements of the gravitational law.

Fig. 7-8. A globular star cluster.

That the law of gravitation is true at even bigger distances is indicated inFig. 7-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul. This ﬁgureshows one of the most beautiful things in the sky—a globular star cluster. Allof the dots are stars. Although they look as if they are packed solid toward thecenter, that is due to the fallibility of our instruments. Actually, the distancesbetween even the centermost stars are very great and they very rarely collide.There are more stars in the interior than farther out, and as we move outwardthere are fewer and fewer. It is obvious that there is an attraction among thesestars. It is clear that gravitation exists at these enormous dimensions, perhaps100,000 times the size of the solar system. Let us now go further, and look at an

7-12

entire galaxy, shown in Fig. 7-9. The shape of this galaxy indicates an obvioustendency for its matter to agglomerate. Of course we cannot prove that thelaw here is precisely inverse square, only that there is still an attraction, at thisenormous dimension, that holds the whole thing together. One may say,「Well,that is all very clever but why is it not just a ball?」Because it is spinning andhas angular momentum which it cannot give up as it contracts; it must contractmostly in a plane. (Incidentally, if you are looking for a good problem, theexact details of how the arms are formed and what determines the shapes ofthese galaxies has not been worked out.) It is, however, clear that the shape ofthe galaxy is due to gravitation even though the complexities of its structurehave not yet allowed us to analyze it completely. In a galaxy we have a scaleof perhaps 50,000 to 100,000 light years. The earth’s distance from the sun is3 light minutes, so you can see how large these dimensions are.8 1Gravity appears to exist at even bigger dimensions, as indicated by Fig. 7-10,which shows many「little」things clustered together. This is a cluster of galaxies,just like a star cluster. Thus galaxies attract each other at such distances thatthey too are agglomerated into clusters. Perhaps gravitation exists even overdistances of tens of millions of light years; so far as we now know, gravity seemsto go out forever inversely as the square of the distance.

7-14

Fig. 7-12. The formation of new stars?

Not only can we understand the nebulae, but from the law of gravitation wecan even get some ideas about the origin of the stars. If we have a big cloud ofdust and gas, as indicated in Fig. 7-11, the gravitational attractions of the piecesof dust for one another might make them form little lumps. Barely visible in theﬁgure are「little」black spots which may be the beginning of the accumulationsof dust and gases which, due to their gravitation, begin to form stars. Whetherwe have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable. Figure 7-12 shows the onepiece of evidence which suggests that we have. At the left is a picture of a regionof gas with some stars in it taken in 1947, and at the right is another picture,taken only 7 years later, which shows two new bright spots. Has gas accumulated,has gravity acted hard enough and collected it into a ball big enough that thestellar nuclear reaction starts in the interior and turns it into a star? Perhaps,and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that in only seven years we should be solucky as to see a star change itself into visible form; it is much less probable thatwe should see two!

7-6 Cavendish’s experimentGravitation, therefore, extends over enormous distances. But if there is aforce between any pair of objects, we ought to be able to measure the force

7-15

between our own objects. Instead of having to watch the stars go around eachother, why can we not take a ball of lead and a marble and watch the marble gotoward the ball of lead? The diﬃculty of this experiment when done in such asimple manner is the very weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done withextreme care, which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, makingsure it is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured.It was ﬁrst measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematicallyindicated in Fig. 7-13. This ﬁrst demonstrated the direct force between two large,ﬁxed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supportedby a very ﬁne ﬁber, called a torsion ﬁber. By measuring how much the ﬁbergets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inverselyproportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus,one may accurately determine the coeﬃcient G in the formula

F = G

mm0r2 .

All the masses and distances are known. You say,「We knew it already forthe earth.」Yes, but we did not know the mass of the earth. By knowing Gfrom this experiment and by knowing how strongly the earth attracts, we canindirectly learn how great is the mass of the earth! This experiment has beencalled「weighing the earth」by some people, and it can be used to determine thecoeﬃcient G of the gravity law. This is the only way in which the mass of the

7-16

earth can be determined. G turns out to be

6.670 × 10−11 newton · m2/kg2.

It is hard to exaggerate the importance of the eﬀect on the history of scienceproduced by this great success of the theory of gravitation. Compare the confusion,the lack of conﬁdence, the incomplete knowledge that prevailed in the earlier ages,when there were endless debates and paradoxes, with the clarity and simplicityof this law—this fact that all the moons and planets and stars have such a simplerule to govern them, and further that man could understand it and deduce howthe planets should move! This is the reason for the success of the sciences infollowing years, for it gave hope that the other phenomena of the world mightalso have such beautifully simple laws.

7-7 What is gravity?But is this such a simple law? What about the machinery of it? All we havedone is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not saidwhat makes it go. Newton made no hypotheses about this; he was satisﬁed to ﬁndwhat it did without getting into the machinery of it. No one has since given anymachinery. It is characteristic of the physical laws that they have this abstractcharacter. The law of conservation of energy is a theorem concerning quantitiesthat have to be calculated and added together, with no mention of the machinery,and likewise the great laws of mechanics are quantitative mathematical laws forwhich no machinery is available. Why can we use mathematics to describe naturewithout a mechanism behind it? No one knows. We have to keep going becausewe ﬁnd out more that way.

Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested. It is interesting toconsider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to time. Atﬁrst, one is quite excited and happy when he「discovers」it, but he soon ﬁndsthat it is not correct. It was ﬁrst discovered about 1750. Suppose there weremany particles moving in space at a very high speed in all directions and beingonly slightly absorbed in going through matter. When they are absorbed, theygive an impulse to the earth. However, since there are as many going one wayas another, the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particlescoming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer of themare coming from the sun than are coming from the other side. Therefore, the

7-17

earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to seethat it is inversely as the square of the distance—because of the variation of thesolid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong withthat machinery? It involves some new consequences which are not true. Thisparticular idea has the following trouble: the earth, in moving around the sun,would impinge on more particles which are coming from its forward side thanfrom its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain in your face is strongerthan that on the back of your head!). Therefore there would be more impulsegiven the earth from the front, and the earth would feel a resistance to motionand would be slowing up in its orbit. One can calculate how long it would takefor the earth to stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take longenough for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work. Nomachinery has ever been invented that「explains」gravity without also predictingsome other phenomenon that does not exist.Next we shall discuss the possible relation of gravitation to other forces. Thereis no explanation of gravitation in terms of other forces at the present time. Itis not an aspect of electricity or anything like that, so we have no explanation.However, gravitation and other forces are very similar, and it is interesting tonote analogies. For example, the force of electricity between two charged objectslooks just like the law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with aminus sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the squareof the distance. It is in the opposite direction—likes repel. But is it still not veryremarkable that the two laws involve the same function of distance? Perhapsgravitation and electricity are much more closely related than we think. Manyattempts have been made to unify them; the so-called uniﬁed ﬁeld theory is onlya very elegant attempt to combine electricity and gravitation; but, in comparinggravitation and electricity, the most interesting thing is the relative strengths ofthe forces. Any theory that contains them both must also deduce how strong thegravity is.

If we take, in some natural units, the repulsion of two electrons (nature’suniversal charge) due to electricity, and the attraction of two electrons due totheir masses, we can measure the ratio of electrical repulsion to the gravitationalattraction. The ratio is independent of the distance and is a fundamental constantof nature. The ratio is shown in Fig. 7-14. The gravitational attraction relativeto the electrical repulsion between two electrons is 1 divided by 4.17 × 1042! Thequestion is, where does such a large number come from? It is not accidental, likethe ratio of the volume of the earth to the volume of a ﬂea. We have considered

actions between two electrons.

two natural aspects of the same thing, an electron. This fantastic number is anatural constant, so it involves something deep in nature. Where could sucha tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day ﬁnd the「universal equation,」and in it, one of the roots will be this number. It is verydiﬃcult to ﬁnd an equation for which such a fantastic number is a natural root.Other possibilities have been thought of; one is to relate it to the age of theuniverse. Clearly, we have to ﬁnd another large number somewhere. But dowe mean the age of the universe in years? No, because years are not「natural」;they were devised by men. As an example of something natural, let us considerthe time it takes light to go across a proton, 10−24 second. If we compare thistime with the age of the universe, 2 × 1010 years, the answer is 10−42. It hasabout the same number of zeros going oﬀ it, so it has been proposed that thegravitational constant is related to the age of the universe. If that were the case,the gravitational constant would change with time, because as the universe gotolder the ratio of the age of the universe to the time which it takes for light to goacross a proton would be gradually increasing. Is it possible that the gravitationalconstant is changing with time? Of course the changes would be so small that itis quite diﬃcult to be sure.

One test which we can think of is to determine what would have been theeﬀect of the change during the past 109 years, which is approximately the agefrom the earliest life on the earth to now, and one-tenth of the age of the universe.In this time, the gravity constant would have increased by about 10 percent.It turns out that if we consider the structure of the sun—the balance between

the weight of its material and the rate at which radiant energy is generatedinside it—we can deduce that if the gravity were 10 percent stronger, the sunwould be much more than 10 percent brighter—by the sixth power of the gravityconstant! If we calculate what happens to the orbit of the earth when the gravityis changing, we ﬁnd that the earth was then closer in. Altogether, the earthwould be about 100 degrees centigrade hotter, and all of the water would nothave been in the sea, but vapor in the air, so life would not have started in thesea. So we do not now believe that the gravity constant is changing with the ageof the universe. But such arguments as the one we have just given are not veryconvincing, and the subject is not completely closed.

It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the mass, thequantity which is fundamentally a measure of inertia—of how hard it is to holdsomething which is going around in a circle. Therefore two objects, one heavyand one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same speedbecause of gravity, will stay together because to go in a circle requires a forcewhich is stronger for a bigger mass. That is, the gravity is stronger for a givenmass in just the right proportion so that the two objects will go around together.If one object were inside the other it would stay inside; it is a perfect balance.Therefore, Gagarin or Titov would ﬁnd things「weightless」inside a space ship; ifthey happened to let go of a piece of chalk, for example, it would go around theearth in exactly the same way as the whole space ship, and so it would appearto remain suspended before them in space. It is very interesting that this forceis exactly proportional to the mass with great precision, because if it were notexactly proportional there would be some eﬀect by which inertia and weightwould diﬀer. The absence of such an eﬀect has been checked with great accuracyby an experiment done ﬁrst by Eötvös in 1909 and more recently by Dicke. Forall substances tried, the masses and weights are exactly proportional within 1part in 1,000,000,000, or less. This is a remarkable experiment.

7-8 Gravity and relativityAnother topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modiﬁcation of Newton’s lawof gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton’s law of gravitationis not correct! It was modiﬁed by Einstein to take into account the theory ofrelativity. According to Newton, the gravitational eﬀect is instantaneous, thatis, if we were to move a mass, we would at once feel a new force because of thenew position of that mass; by such means we could send signals at inﬁnite speed.

Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we cannot send signals fasterthan the speed of light, so the law of gravitation must be wrong. By correctingit to take the delays into account, we have a new law, called Einstein’s law ofgravitation. One feature of this new law which is quite easy to understand is this:In the Einstein relativity theory, anything which has energy has mass—mass inthe sense that it is attracted gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy,has a「mass.」When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sunthere is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but isdeﬂected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which are aroundthe sun should appear displaced from where they would be if the sun were notthere, and this has been observed.

Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories. In recent years we havediscovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that there are several kindsof interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc. None of these nuclear or electricalforces has yet been found to explain gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspectsof nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is sosmall that we need the quantum eﬀects, the gravitational eﬀects are so weakthat the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. Onthe other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important tosee whether Newton’s law modiﬁed to Einstein’s law can be further modiﬁed tobe consistent with the uncertainty principle. This last modiﬁcation has not yetbeen completed.
