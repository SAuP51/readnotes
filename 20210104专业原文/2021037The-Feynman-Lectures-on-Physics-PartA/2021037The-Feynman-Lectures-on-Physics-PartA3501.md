Color Vision

35-1 The human eyeThe phenomenon of colors depends partly on the physical world. We discussthe colors of soap ﬁlms and so on as being produced by interference. But also,of course, it depends on the eye, or what happens behind the eye, in the brain.Physics characterizes the light that enters the eye, but after that, our sensationsare the result of photochemical-neural processes and psychological responses.

There are many interesting phenomena associated with vision which involvea mixture of physical phenomena and physiological processes, and the full ap-preciation of natural phenomena, as we see them, must go beyond physics inthe usual sense. We make no apologies for making these excursions into otherﬁelds, because the separation of ﬁelds, as we have emphasized, is merely a humanconvenience, and an unnatural thing. Nature is not interested in our separations,and many of the interesting phenomena bridge the gaps between ﬁelds.

In Chapter 3 we have already discussed the relation of physics to the othersciences in general terms, but now we are going to look in some detail at a speciﬁcﬁeld in which physics and other sciences are very, very closely interrelated. Thatarea is vision. In particular, we shall discuss color vision. In the present chapterwe shall discuss mainly the observable phenomena of human vision, and in thenext chapter we shall consider the physiological aspects of vision, both in manand in other animals.

It all begins with the eye; so, in order to understand what phenomena we see,some knowledge of the eye is required. In the next chapter we shall discuss in somedetail how the various parts of the eye work, and how they are interconnectedwith the nervous system. For the present, we shall describe only brieﬂy how theeye functions (Fig. 35-1).

Light enters the eye through the cornea; we have already discussed how it isbent and is imaged on a layer called the retina in the back of the eye, so that

35-1

Fig. 35-1. The eye.

diﬀerent parts of the retina receive light from diﬀerent parts of the visual ﬁeldoutside. The retina is not absolutely uniform: there is a place, a spot, in thecenter of our ﬁeld of view which we use when we are trying to see things verycarefully, and at which we have the greatest acuity of vision; it is called the foveaor macula. The side parts of the eye, as we can immediately appreciate fromour experience in looking at things, are not as eﬀective for seeing detail as is thecenter of the eye. There is also a spot in the retina where the nerves carrying allthe information run out; that is a blind spot. There is no sensitive part of theretina here, and it is possible to demonstrate that if we close, say, the left eye andlook straight at something, and then move a ﬁnger or another small object slowlyout of the ﬁeld of view it suddenly disappears somewhere. The only practical useof this fact that we know of is that some physiologist became quite a favorite inthe court of a king of France by pointing this out to him; in the boring sessionsthat he had with his courtiers, the king could amuse himself by「cutting oﬀ theirheads」by looking at one and watching another’s head disappear.

Figure 35-2 shows a magniﬁed view of the inside of the retina in somewhatschematic form.In diﬀerent parts of the retina there are diﬀerent kinds ofstructures. The objects that occur more densely near the periphery of the retinaare called rods. Closer to the fovea, we ﬁnd, besides these rod cells, also conecells. We shall describe the structure of these cells later. As we get close to the

35-2

Fig. 35-2. The structure of the retina. (Light enters from below.)

fovea, the number of cones increases, and in the fovea itself there are in factnothing but cone cells, packed very tightly, so tightly that the cone cells aremuch ﬁner, or narrower here than anywhere else. So we must appreciate that wesee with the cones right in the middle of the ﬁeld of view, but as we go to theperiphery we have the other cells, the rods. Now the interesting thing is thatin the retina each of the cells which is sensitive to light is not connected by aﬁber directly to the optic nerve, but is connected to many other cells, which arethemselves connected to each other. There are several kinds of cells: there arecells that carry the information toward the optic nerve, but there are others thatare mainly interconnected「horizontally.」There are essentially four kinds of cells,but we shall not go into these details now. The main thing we emphasize is thatthe light signal is already being「thought about.」That is to say, the informationfrom the various cells does not immediately go to the brain, spot for spot, but inthe retina a certain amount of the information has already been digested, by acombining of the information from several visual receptors. It is important tounderstand that some brain-function phenomena occur in the eye itself.

35-2 Color depends on intensityOne of the most striking phenomena of vision is the dark adaptation of theeye. If we go into the dark from a brightly lighted room, we cannot see very wellfor a while, but gradually things become more and more apparent, and eventually

35-3

we can see something where we could see nothing before. If the intensity of thelight is very low, the things that we see have no color. It is known that thisdark-adapted vision is almost entirely due to the rods, while the vision in brightlight is due to the cones. As a result, there are a number of phenomena that wecan easily appreciate because of this transfer of function from the cones and rodstogether, to just the rods.

There are many situations in which, if the light intensity were stronger, wecould see color, and we would ﬁnd these things quite beautiful. One exampleis that through a telescope we nearly always see「black and white」images offaint nebulae, but W. C. Miller of the Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatorieshad the patience to make color pictures of some of these objects. Nobody hasever really seen these colors with the eye, but they are not artiﬁcial colors, itis merely that the light intensity is not strong enough for the cones in our eyeto see them. Among the more spectacular such objects are the ring nebula andthe Crab nebula. The former shows a beautiful blue inner part, with a brightred outer halo, and the latter shows a general bluish haze permeated by brightred-orange ﬁlaments.

In the bright light, apparently, the rods are at very low sensitivity but, in thedark, as time goes on they pick up their ability to see light. The variations in lightintensity for which one can adapt is over a million to one. Nature does not doall this with just one kind of cell, but she passes her job from bright-light-seeingcells, the color-seeing cells, the cones, to low-intensity, dark-adapted cells, therods. Among the interesting consequences of this shift is, ﬁrst, that there is nocolor, and second, that there is a diﬀerence in the relative brightness of diﬀerentlycolored objects. It turns out that the rods see better toward the blue than thecones do, and the cones can see, for example, deep red light, while the rods ﬁndthat absolutely impossible to see. So red light is black so far as the rods areconcerned. Thus two pieces of colored paper, say blue and red, in which the redmight be even brighter than the blue in good light, will, in the dark, appearcompletely reversed. It is a very striking eﬀect. If we are in the dark and canﬁnd a magazine or something that has colors and, before we know for sure whatthe colors are, we judge the lighter and darker areas, and if we then carry themagazine into the light, we may see this very remarkable shift between which wasthe brightest color and which was not. The phenomenon is called the Purkinjeeﬀect.In Fig. 35-3, the dashed curve represents the sensitivity of the eye in the dark,i.e., using the rods, while the solid curve represents it in the light. We see that

35-4

Fig. 35-3. The spectral sensitivity of the eye. Dashed curve, rods;

solid curve, cones.

the peak sensitivity of the rods is in the green region and that of the cones ismore in the yellow region. If there is a red-colored page (red is about 650 mµ)we can see it if it is brightly lighted, but in the dark it is almost invisible.Another eﬀect of the fact that rods take over in the dark, and that there areno rods in the fovea, is that when we look straight at something in the dark, ourvision is not quite as acute as when we look to one side. A faint star or nebulacan sometimes be seen better by looking a little to one side than directly at it,because we do not have sensitive rods in the middle of the fovea.

Another interesting eﬀect of the fact that the number of cones decreases aswe go farther to the side of the ﬁeld of view is that even in a bright light colordisappears as the object goes far to one side. The way to test that is to look insome particular ﬁxed direction, let a friend walk in from one side with coloredcards, and try to decide what color they are before they are right in front of you.One ﬁnds that he can see that the cards are there long before he can determinethe color. When doing this, it is advisable to come in from the side opposite theblind spot, because it is otherwise rather confusing to almost see the color, thennot see anything, then to see the color again.

Another interesting phenomenon is that the periphery of the retina is verysensitive to motion. Although we cannot see very well from the corner of oureye, if a little bug moves and we do not expect anything to be moving over there,

35-5

we are immediately sensitive to it. We are all「wired up」to look for somethingjiggling to the side of the ﬁeld.

35-3 Measuring the color sensationNow we go to the cone vision, to the brighter vision, and we come to thequestion which is most characteristic of cone vision, and that is color. As weknow, white light can be split by a prism into a whole spectrum of wavelengthswhich appear to us to have diﬀerent colors; that is what colors are, of course:appearances. Any source of light can be analyzed by a grating or a prism, and onecan determine the spectral distribution, i.e., the「amount」of each wavelength. Acertain light may have a lot of blue, considerable red, very little yellow, and so on.That is all very precise in the sense of physics, but the question is, what color willit appear to be? It is evident that the diﬀerent colors depend somehow upon thespectral distribution of the light, but the problem is to ﬁnd what characteristicsof the spectral distribution produce the various sensations. For example, whatdo we have to do to get a green color? We all know that we can simply take apiece of the spectrum which is green. But is that the only way to get green, ororange, or any other color?

Is there more than one spectral distribution which produces the same apparentvisual eﬀect? The answer is, deﬁnitely yes. There is a very limited number ofvisual eﬀects, in fact just a three-dimensional manifold of them, as we shallshortly see, but there is an inﬁnite number of diﬀerent curves that we can drawfor the light that comes from diﬀerent sources. Now the question we have todiscuss is, under what conditions do diﬀerent distributions of light appear asexactly the same color to the eye?

The most powerful psycho-physical technique in color judgment is to use theeye as a null instrument. That is, we do not try to deﬁne what constitutes agreen sensation, or to measure in what circumstances we get a green sensation,because it turns out that this is extremely complicated. Instead, we study theconditions under which two stimuli are indistinguishable. Then we do not haveto decide whether two people see the same sensation in diﬀerent circumstances,but only whether, if for one person two sensations are the same, they are also thesame for another. We do not have to decide whether, when one sees somethinggreen, what it feels like inside is the same as what it feels like inside someoneelse when he sees something green; we do not know anything about that.

35-6

To illustrate the possibilities, we may use a series of four projector lampswhich have ﬁlters on them, and whose brightnesses are continuously adjustableover a wide range: one has a red ﬁlter and makes a spot of red light on thescreen, the next one has a green ﬁlter and makes a green spot, the third onehas a blue ﬁlter, and the fourth one is a white circle with a black spot in themiddle of it. Now if we turn on some red light, and next to it put some green,we see that in the area of overlap it produces a sensation which is not what wecall reddish green, but a new color, yellow in this particular case. By changingthe proportions of the red and the green, we can go through various shades oforange and so forth. If we have set it for a certain yellow, we can also obtainthat same yellow, not by mixing these two colors but by mixing some other ones,perhaps a yellow ﬁlter with white light, or something like that, to get the samesensation. In other words, it is possible to make various colors in more than oneway by mixing the lights from various ﬁlters.

What we have just discovered may be expressed analytically as follows. Aparticular yellow, for example, can be represented by a certain symbol Y , which isthe「sum」of certain amounts of red-ﬁltered light (R) and green-ﬁltered light (G).By using two numbers, say r and g, to describe how bright the R and G are, wecan write a formula for this yellow:

Y = rR + gG.

(35.1)

The question is, can we make all the diﬀerent colors by adding together twoor three lights of diﬀerent, ﬁxed colors? Let us see what can be done in thatconnection. We certainly cannot get all the diﬀerent colors by mixing only redand green, because, for instance, blue never appears in such a mixture. However,by putting in some blue the central region, where all three spots overlap, maybe made to appear to be a fairly nice white. By mixing the various colors andlooking at this central region, we ﬁnd that we can get a considerable range ofcolors in that region by changing the proportions, and so it is not impossiblethat all the colors can be made by mixing these three colored lights. We shalldiscuss to what extent this is true; it is in fact essentially correct, and we shallshortly see how to deﬁne the proposition better.

In order to illustrate our point, we move the spots on the screen so that theyall fall on top of each other, and then we try to match a particular color whichappears in the annular ring made by the fourth lamp. What we once thoughtwas「white」coming from the fourth lamp now appears yellowish. We may try to

35-7

match that by adjusting the red and green and blue as best we can by a kind oftrial and error, and we ﬁnd that we can approach rather closely this particularshade of「cream」color. So it is not hard to believe that we can make all colors.We shall try to make yellow in a moment, but before we do that, there is onecolor that might be very hard to make. People who give lectures on color makeall the「bright」colors, but they never make brown, and it is hard to recall everhaving seen brown light. As a matter of fact, this color is never used for anystage eﬀect, one never sees a spotlight with brown light; so we think it mightbe impossible to make brown. In order to ﬁnd out whether it is possible tomake brown, we point out that brown light is merely something that we are notused to seeing without its background. As a matter of fact, we can make it bymixing some red and yellow. To prove that we are looking at brown light, wemerely increase the brightness of the annular background against which we seethe very same light, and we see that that is, in fact, what we call brown! Brownis always a dark color next to a lighter background. We can easily change thecharacter of the brown. For example, if we take some green out we get a reddishbrown, apparently a chocolaty reddish brown, and if we put more green into it,in proportion, we get that horrible color which all the uniforms of the Army aremade of, but the light from that color is not so horrible by itself; it is of yellowishgreen, but seen against a light background.

Now we put a yellow ﬁlter in front of the fourth light and try to match that.(The intensity must of course be within the range of the various lamps; we cannotmatch something which is too bright, because we do not have enough power inthe lamp.) But we can match the yellow; we use a green and red mixture, andput in a touch of blue to make it even more perfect. Perhaps we are ready tobelieve that, under good conditions, we can make a perfect match of any givencolor.

Now let us discuss the laws of color mixture. In the ﬁrst place, we found thatdiﬀerent spectral distributions can produce the same color; next, we saw that「any」color can be made by adding together three special colors, red, blue, andgreen. The most interesting feature of color mixing is this: if we have a certainlight, which we may call X, and if it appears indistinguishable from Y , to theeye (it may be a diﬀerent spectral distribution, but it appears indistinguishable),we call these colors「equal,」in the sense that the eye sees them as equal, and wewrite

X = Y.

35-8

(35.2)

Here is one of the great laws of color: if two spectral distributions are indistin-guishable, and we add to each one a certain light, say Z (if we write X + Z,this means that we shine both lights on the same patch), and then we take Yand add the same amount of the same other light, Z, the new mixtures are alsoindistinguishable:

X + Z = Y + Z.

(35.3)We have just matched our yellow; if we now shine pink light on the whole thing,it will still match. So adding any other light to the matched lights leaves a match.In other words, we can summarize all these color phenomena by saying that oncewe have a match between two colored lights, seen next to each other in the samecircumstances, then this match will remain, and one light can be substituted forthe other light in any other color mixing situation. In fact, it turns out, andit is very important and interesting, that this matching of the color of lights isnot dependent upon the characteristics of the eye at the moment of observation:we know that if we look for a long time at a bright red surface, or a bright redlight, and then look at a white paper, it looks greenish, and other colors are alsodistorted by our having looked so long at the bright red. If we now have a matchbetween, say, two yellows, and we look at them and make them match, then welook at a bright red surface for a long time, and then turn back to the yellow,it may not look yellow any more; I do not know what color it will look, but itwill not look yellow. Nevertheless the yellows will still look matched, and so, asthe eye adapts to various levels of intensity, the color match still works, with theobvious exception of when we go into the region where the intensity of the lightgets so low that we have shifted from cones to rods; then the color match is nolonger a color match, because we are using a diﬀerent system.

The second principle of color mixing of lights is this: any color at all canbe made from three diﬀerent colors, in our case, red, green, and blue lights.By suitably mixing the three together we can make anything at all, as wedemonstrated with our two examples. Further, these laws are very interestingmathematically. For those who are interested in the mathematics of the thing, itturns out as follows. Suppose that we take our three colors, which were red, green,and blue, but label them A, B, and C, and call them our primary colors. Thenany color could be made by certain amounts of these three: say an amount a ofcolor A, an amount b of color B, and an amount c of color C makes X:

X = aA + bB + cC.

(35.4)

35-9

Now suppose another color Y is made from the same three colors:

Y = a0A + b0B + c0C.

(35.5)

Then it turns out that the mixture of the two lights (it is one of the consequencesof the laws that we have already mentioned) is obtained by taking the sum ofthe components of X and Y :

Z = X + Y = (a + a0)A + (b + b0)B + (c + c0)C.

(35.6)It is just like the mathematics of the addition of vectors, where (a, b, c) are thecomponents of one vector, and (a0, b0, c0) are those of another vector, and the newlight Z is then the「sum」of the vectors. This subject has always appealed tophysicists and mathematicians. In fact, Schrödinger wrote a wonderful paper oncolor vision in which he developed this theory of vector analysis as applied tothe mixing of colors.

Now a question is, what are the correct primary colors to use? There is nosuch thing as「the」correct primary colors for the mixing of lights. There may be,for practical purposes, three paints that are more useful than others for getting agreater variety of mixed pigments, but we are not discussing that matter now.Any three diﬀerently colored lights whatsoever* can always be mixed in the correctproportion to produce any color whatsoever. Can we demonstrate this fantasticfact? Instead of using red, green, and blue, let us use red, blue, and yellow inour projector. Can we use red, blue, and yellow to make, say, green?

By mixing these three colors in various proportions, we get quite an array ofdiﬀerent colors, ranging over quite a spectrum. But as a matter of fact, after alot of trial and error, we ﬁnd that nothing ever looks like green. The questionis, can we make green? The answer is yes. How? By projecting some red ontothe green, then we can make a match with a certain mixture of yellow and blue!So we have matched them, except that we had to cheat by putting the red onthe other side. But since we have some mathematical sophistication, we canappreciate that what we really showed was not that X could always be made, say,of red, blue, and yellow, but by putting the red on the other side we found thatred plus X could be made out of blue and yellow. Putting it on the other side ofthe equation, we can interpret that as a negative amount, so if we will allow thatthe coeﬃcients in equations like (35.4) can be both positive and negative, and if

* Except, of course, if one of the three can be matched by mixing the other two.

35-10

we interpret negative amounts to mean that we have to add those to the otherside, then any color can be matched by any three, and there is no such thing as「the」fundamental primaries.We may ask whether there are three colors that come only with positiveamounts for all mixings. The answer is no. Every set of three primaries requiresnegative amounts for some colors, and therefore there is no unique way to deﬁnea primary. In elementary books they are said to be red, green, and blue, but thatis merely because with these a wider range of colors is available without minussigns for some of the combinations.

35-4 The chromaticity diagramNow let us discuss the combination of colors on a mathematical level as ageometrical proposition. If any one color is represented by Eq. (35.4), we canplot it as a vector in space by plotting along three axes the amounts a, b, and c,and then a certain color is a point. If another color is a0, b0, c0, that color islocated somewhere else. The sum of the two, as we know, is the color whichcomes from adding these as vectors. We can simplify this diagram and representeverything on a plane by the following observation: if we had a certain color light,and merely doubled a and b and c, that is, if we make them all stronger in thesame ratio, it is the same color, but brighter. So if we agree to reduce everythingto the same light intensity, then we can project everything onto a plane, andthis has been done in Fig. 35-4. It follows that any color obtained by mixing agiven two in some proportion will lie somewhere on a line drawn between the twopoints. For instance, a ﬁfty-ﬁfty mixture would appear halfway between them,and 1/4 of one and 3/4 of the other would appear 1/4 of the way from one pointto the other, and so on. If we use a blue and a green and a red, as primaries,we see that all the colors that we can make with positive coeﬃcients are insidethe dotted triangle, which contains almost all of the colors that we can ever see,because all the colors that we can ever see are enclosed in the oddly shaped areabounded by the curve. Where did this area come from? Once somebody made avery careful match of all the colors that we can see against three special ones.But we do not have to check all colors that we can see, we only have to check thepure spectral colors, the lines of the spectrum. Any light can be considered as asum of various positive amounts of various pure spectral colors—pure from thephysical standpoint. A given light will have a certain amount of red, yellow, blue,and so on—spectral colors. So if we know how much of each of our three chosen

35-11

Fig. 35-4. The standard chromaticity diagram.

primaries is needed to make each of these pure components, we can calculatehow much of each is needed to make our given color. So, if we ﬁnd out what thecolor coeﬃcients of all the spectral colors are for any given three primary colors,then we can work out the whole color mixing table.

An example of such experimental results for mixing three lights togetheris given in Fig. 35-5. This ﬁgure shows the amount of each of three diﬀerentparticular primaries, red, green and blue, which is required to make each of thespectral colors. Red is at the left end of the spectrum, yellow is next, and so on, allthe way to blue. Notice that at some points minus signs are necessary. It is fromsuch data that it is possible to locate the position of all of the colors on a chart,where the x- and the y-coordinates are related to the amounts of the diﬀerentprimaries that are used. That is the way that the curved boundary line has beenfound. It is the locus of the pure spectral colors. Now any other color can bemade by adding spectral lines, of course, and so we ﬁnd that anything that can beproduced by connecting one part of this curve to another is a color that is availablein nature. The straight line connects the extreme violet end of the spectrum withthe extreme red end. It is the locus of the purples. Inside the boundary are colorsthat can be made with lights, and outside it are colors that cannot be made withlights, and nobody has ever seen them (except, possibly, in after-images!).

certain set of standard primary colors.

35-5 The mechanism of color visionNow the next aspect of the matter is the question, why do colors behave inthis way? The simplest theory, proposed by Young and Helmholtz, supposes thatin the eye there are three diﬀerent pigments which receive the light and that thesehave diﬀerent absorption spectra, so that one pigment absorbs strongly, say, inthe red, another absorbs strongly in the blue, another absorbs in the green. Thenwhen we shine a light on them we will get diﬀerent amounts of absorptions in thethree regions, and these three pieces of information are somehow maneuvered inthe brain or in the eye, or somewhere, to decide what the color is. It is easy todemonstrate that all of the rules of color mixing would be a consequence of thisproposition. There has been considerable debate about the thing because thenext problem, of course, is to ﬁnd the absorption characteristics of each of thethree pigments. It turns out, unfortunately, that because we can transform thecolor coordinates in any manner we want to, we can only ﬁnd all kinds of linearcombinations of absorption curves by the color-mixing experiments, but not thecurves for the individual pigments. People have tried in various ways to obtain aspeciﬁc curve which does describe some particular physical property of the eye.One such curve is called a brightness curve, demonstrated in Fig. 35-3. In thisﬁgure are two curves, one for eyes in the dark, the other for eyes in the light;the latter is the cone brightness curve. This is measured by ﬁnding what is thesmallest amount of colored light we need in order to be able to just see it. Thismeasures how sensitive the eye is in diﬀerent spectral regions. There is another

35-13

very interesting way to measure this. If we take two colors and make them appearin an area, by ﬂickering back and forth from one to the other, we see a ﬂickerif the frequency is too low. However, as the frequency increases, the ﬂicker willultimately disappear at a certain frequency that depends on the brightness ofthe light, let us say at 16 repetitions per second. Now if we adjust the brightnessor the intensity of one color against the other, there comes an intensity wherethe ﬂicker at 16 cycles disappears. To get ﬂicker with the brightness so adjusted,we have to go to a much lower frequency in order to see a ﬂicker of the color.So, we get what we call a ﬂicker of the brightness at a higher frequency and,at a lower frequency, a ﬂicker of the color. It is possible to match two colorsfor「equal brightness」by this ﬂicker technique. The results are almost, but notexactly, the same as those obtained by measuring the threshold sensitivity of theeye for seeing weak light by the cones. Most workers use the ﬂicker system as adeﬁnition of the brightness curve.

Now, if there are three color-sensitive pigments in the eye, the problem is todetermine the shape of the absorption spectrum of each one. How? We knowthere are people who are color blind—eight percent of the male population, andone-half of one percent of the female population. Most of the people who are colorblind or abnormal in color vision have a diﬀerent degree of sensitivity than othersto a variation of color, but they still need three colors to match. However, thereare some who are called dichromats, for whom any color can be matched using onlytwo primary colors. The obvious suggestion, then, is to say that they are missingone of the three pigments. If we can ﬁnd three kinds of color-blind dichromats whohave diﬀerent color-mixing rules, one kind should be missing the red, another thegreen, and another the blue pigmentation. By measuring all these types we candetermine the three curves! It turns out that there are three types of dichromaticcolor blindness; there are two common types and a third very rare type, andfrom these three it has been possible to deduce the pigment absorption spectra.Figure 35-6 shows the color mixing of a particular type of color-blind personcalled a deuteranope. For him, the loci of constant colors are not points, butcertain lines, along each of which the color appears to him to be the same. If thetheory that he is missing one of the three pieces of information is right, all theselines should intersect at a point. If we carefully measure on this graph, they dointersect perfectly. Obviously, therefore, this has been made by a mathematicianand does not represent real data! As a matter of fact, if we look at the latestpaper with real data, it turns out that in the graph of Fig. 35-6, the point offocus of all the lines is not exactly at the right place. Using the lines in the

35-14

Fig. 35-6. Loci of colors confused by deuteranopes.

above ﬁgure, we cannot ﬁnd reasonable spectra; we need negative and positiveabsorptions in diﬀerent regions. But using the new data of Yustova, it turns outthat each of the absorption curves is everywhere positive.

Figure 35-7 shows a diﬀerent kind of color blindness, that of the protanope,which has a focus near the red end of the boundary curve. Yustova gets approxi-mately the same position in this case. Using the three diﬀerent kinds of colorblindness, the three pigment response curves have ﬁnally been determined, andare shown in Fig. 35-8. Finally? Perhaps. There is a question as to whether thethree-pigment idea is right, whether color blindness results from lack of one pig-ment, and even whether the color-mix data on color blindness are right. Diﬀerentworkers get diﬀerent results. This ﬁeld is still very much under development.

35-6 Physiochemistry of color visionNow, what about checking these curves against actual pigments in the eye?The pigments that can be obtained from a retina consist mainly of a pigmentcalled visual purple. The most remarkable features of this are, ﬁrst, that it is in

the eye of almost every vertebrate animal, and second, that its response curveﬁts beautifully with the sensitivity of the eye, as seen in Fig. 35-9, in which areplotted on the same scale the absorption of visual purple and the sensitivity ofthe dark-adapted eye. This pigment is evidently the pigment that we see within the dark: visual purple is the pigment for the rods, and it has nothing to dowith color vision. This fact was discovered in 1877. Even today it can be saidthat the color pigments of the cones have never been obtained in a test tube. In1958 it could be said that the color pigments had never been seen at all. Butsince that time, two of them have been detected by Rushton by a very simpleand beautiful technique.

The trouble is, presumably, that since the eye is so weakly sensitive to brightlight compared with light of low intensity, it needs a lot of visual purple to seewith, but not much of the color pigments for seeing colors. Rushton’s idea is toleave the pigment in the eye, and measure it anyway. What he does is this. Thereis an instrument called an ophthalmoscope for sending light into the eye throughthe lens and then focusing the light that comes back out. With it one can measurehow much is reﬂected. So one measures the reﬂection coeﬃcient of light whichhas gone twice through the pigment (reﬂected by a back layer in the eyeball,and coming out through the pigment of the cone again). Nature is not alwaysso beautifully designed. The cones are interestingly designed so that the lightthat comes into the cone bounces around and works its way down into the littlesensitive points at the apex. The light goes right down into the sensitive point,bounces at the bottom and comes back out again, having traversed a considerable

amount of the color-vision pigment; also, by looking at the fovea, where thereare no rods, one is not confused by visual purple. But the color of the retinahas been seen a long time ago: it is a sort of orangey pink; then there are all theblood vessels, and the color of the material at the back, and so on. How do weknow when we are looking at the pigment? Answer: First we take a color-blindperson, who has fewer pigments and for whom it is therefore easier to makethe analysis. Second, the various pigments, like visual purple, have an intensitychange when they are bleached by light; when we shine light on them they changetheir concentration. So, while looking at the absorption spectrum of the eye,Rushton put another beam in the whole eye, which changes the concentration ofthe pigment, and he measured the change in the spectrum, and the diﬀerence, ofcourse, has nothing to do with the amount of blood or the color of the reﬂectinglayers, and so on, but only the pigment, and in this manner Rushton obtaineda curve for the pigment of the protanope eye, which is given in Fig. 35-10.

colorblind eye (squares) and a normal eye (dots).

The second curve in Fig. 35-10 is a curve obtained with a normal eye. Thiswas obtained by taking a normal eye and, having already determined what onepigment was, bleaching the other one in the red where the ﬁrst one is insensitive.Red light has no eﬀect on the protanope eye, but does in the normal eye, and thusone can obtain the curve for the missing pigment. The shape of one curve ﬁtsbeautifully with Yustova’s green curve, but the red curve is a little bit displaced.So perhaps we are getting on the right track. Or perhaps not—the latest workwith deuteranopes does not show any deﬁnite pigment missing.

Color is not a question of the physics of the light itself. Color is a sensation,and the sensation for diﬀerent colors is diﬀerent in diﬀerent circumstances. Forinstance, if we have a pink light, made by superimposing crossing beams of whitelight and red light (all we can make with white and red is pink, obviously), wemay show that white light may appear blue. If we place an object in the beams,it casts two shadows—one illuminated by the white light alone and the otherby the red. For most people the「white」shadow of an object looks blue, but ifwe keep expanding this shadow until it covers the entire screen, we see that itsuddenly appears white, not blue! We can get other eﬀects of the same natureby mixing red, yellow, and white light. Red, yellow, and white light can produceonly orangey yellows, and so on. So if we mix such lights roughly equally, weget only orange light. Nevertheless, by casting diﬀerent kinds of shadows in thelight, with various overlaps of colors, one gets quite a series of beautiful colorswhich are not in the light themselves (that is only orange), but in our sensations.We clearly see many diﬀerent colors that are quite unlike the「physical」ones inthe beam. It is very important to appreciate that a retina is already「thinking」about the light; it is comparing what it sees in one region with what it sees inanother, although not consciously. What we know of how it does that is thesubject of the next chapter.
