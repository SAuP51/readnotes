## PREFACE

The changes brought about in version 3.x continue the trend of iterating and improving the language, taking a larger step toward removing some of its last major flaws, and representing a bigger jump in the continuing evolution of the language. Similarly, the structure of the book is also making a rather significant transition. Due to its size and scope, Core Python Programming as it has existed wouldn’t be able to handle all the new material introduced in this third edition.

Therefore, Prentice Hall and I have decided the best way of moving forward is to take that logical division represented by Parts I and II of the previous editions, representing the core language and advanced applications topics, respectively, and divide the book into two volumes at this juncture. You are holding in your hands (perhaps in eBook form) the second half of the third edition of Core Python Programming. The good news is that the first half is not required in order to make use of the rich amount of content in this volume. We only recommend that you have intermediate Python experience. If you’ve learned Python recently and are fairly comfortable with using it, or have existing Python skills and want to take it to the next level, then you’ve come to the right place!

As existing Core Python Programming readers already know, my primary focus is teaching you the core of the Python language in a comprehensive manner, much more than just its syntax (which you don’t really need a book to learn, right?). Knowing more about how Python works under the hood—including the relationship between data objects and memory management—will make you a much more effective Python programmer right out of the gate. This is what Part I, and now Core Python Language Fundamentals, is all about.

• Web-based e-mail examples (Chapter 3)

• Using Tile/Ttk (Chapter 5)

• Using MongoDB (Chapter 6)

• More significant Outlook and PowerPoint examples (Chapter 7)

• Web server gateway interface (WSGI) (Chapter 10)

• Using Twitter (Chapter 13)

• Using Google+ (Chapter 15)

In addition, we are proud to introduce three brand new chapters to the book: Chapter 11, “Web Frameworks: Django,” Chapter 12, “Cloud Computing: Google App Engine,” and Chapter 14, “Text Processing.” These represent new or ongoing areas of application development for which Python is used quite often. All existing chapters have been refreshed and updated to the latest versions of Python, possibly including new material. Take a look at the chapter guide that follows for more details on what to expect from every part of this volume.

This book is divided into three parts. The first part, which takes up about two-thirds of the text, gives you treatment of the "core" members of an application development toolset  (with Python being the focus, of course). 

The second part concentrates on a variety of topics, all tied to Web programming. The book concludes with the supplemental section which provides experimental chapters that are under development and hopefully will grow into independent chapters in future editions.
