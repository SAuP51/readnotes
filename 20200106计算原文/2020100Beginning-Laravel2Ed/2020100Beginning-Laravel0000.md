## Introduction

After reading this book, you will be able to develop any web application using Laravel 5.8. It details all you need to know, including the Model-View-Controller pattern, SQLite databases, routing, Eloquent relations, authorization, middleware, events, broadcasting, APIs, and CRUD applications. I use four applications to explain various aspects of Laravel 5.8, and you can find the source code for all of them in this bookâ€™s GitHub repository, which you can find at [Apress/beginning-laravel-2e: Source Code for 'Beginning Laravel, 2nd Edition' by Sanjib Sinha](https://github.com/Apress/beginning-laravel-2e).

After showing how to set up your environment, the book explains routing, controllers, templates, and views in detail so that beginners can get started easily. It explains how a resourceful controller can become your great friend in keeping resources separated.

While introducing models, I also explain route model binding, model relations, and the relationship between models, databases, and Eloquent. I also explain how user input and dependency injection work together and how Elixir and pagination work.

Understanding Eloquent relationships is important, so this book explains all types of relations, including one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, has-many-through, and polymorphic.

While learning about Query Builder and Database Facade, you will also learn how you use fake database data for testing purposes.

Handling user data and redirecting it plays a big role in Laravel, so this is explained along with web form fundamentals and validations.

Artisan and Tinker are two great features of Laravel 5.8; you will learn about them in detail. You will also learn how to use SQLite in a small or medium-sized application.

In this book, you will get a detailed overview of authentication, authorization, and middleware; in addition, you will learn how authorization can be managed through Blade templates, gates, and policies.

After a detailed discussion of Laravel container and facades, you will learn how a mail template works, how one user can send a notification to another, and so on. Events and broadcasting also play vital roles in building complicated applications. The same is true for APIs; they are explained with examples.

At the end of the book, you will also get a glimpse of all the new features of Laravel 5.8.
