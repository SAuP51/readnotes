## 0101Story Time

Early one Friday the boss came to Ward to introduce him to Peter, a prospective customer for WyCash, the bond portfolio management system they were selling. Peter said, “I’m very impressed with the functionality I see. However, I notice you only handle US dollar denominated bonds. I’m starting a new bond fund and my strategy requires that I handle bonds in different currencies.” The boss turned to Ward, “Well, can we do it?”

Here is the nightmare scenario for any software designer. You have been cruising along happily and successfully with a set of assumptions. Suddenly, everything changes. And the nightmare wasn’t just for Ward. The boss, an experienced hand at directing software development, wasn’t sure what the answer was going to be.

WyCash had been developed over the course of a couple of years by a small team. It was able to handle most of the varieties of fixed income securities commonly found on the US market, and a few exotic new instruments, like Guaranteed Investment Contracts, that the competition couldn’t handle.

WyCash had been developed all along using objects and an object database. The fundamental abstraction of computation, Dollar, had been outsourced at the beginning to a clever group of programmers. The resulting object combined formatting and calculation responsibilities.

For the last six months, Ward and the rest of the team had been slowly divesting Dollar of its responsibilities. The Smalltalk numerical classes turned out to be just fine at calculation. All the tricky code for rounding to three decimal digits got in the way of producing precise answers. As the answers got more precise, the complicated mechanisms in the testing framework for comparing to within a certain tolerance were replaced by precise matching of expected and actual results.

Responsibility for formatting actually belonged in the user interface classes. As the tests were written at the level of the user interface classes, in particular the report framework 1 , these tests didn’t have to change to accomodate this refinement. After

six months of careful paring, the resulting Dollar didn’t have much responsibility left.

One of the most complicated algorithms in the system, weighted average, had likewise been undergoing a slow transformation. At one time there had been many different variations of weighted average code scattered throughout the system. As the report framework coalesced from the primodial object soup, it was obvious that there could be one home for the algorithm, in AveragedColumn.

It was to AveragedColumn that Ward now turned. If weighted averages could be made multi-currency, the rest of the system should be possible. The heart of the algorithm was keeping a count of the money in the column. In fact, the algorithm had been abstracted enough to calculate the weighted average of any object that could act arithmetic. You could have weighted averages of dates, for example.

The weekend past in the usual weekend activities. Monday morning the boss was back. “Can we do it?” “Give me another day and I’ll tell you for sure.”

Since Dollar acted like a counter in weighted average, in order to calculate in multiple currencies they needed an object with a counter per currency, kind of like a

polynomial. Instead of 3x 2 and 4y 3 , though, the terms would be 15 USD and 200 CHF.

A quick experiment showed that it was possible to compute with a generic Currency object instead of a Dollar, and return a PolyCurrency when two un-alike currencies were added together. The trick now was to make space for the new functionality without breaking anything that already worked. What would happen if Ward just ran the tests?

2 After adding a few un-implemented operations to Currency, the bulk of the tests passed. By the end of the day, all the tests were passing. Ward checked the code into the build and went to the boss. “We can do it,” he said confidently.

Let’s think a bit about this story. In two days, the potential market was multiplied several fold, multiplying the value of WyCash several fold. The ability to create so much business value so quickly was no accident though. Several factors came into play:

• Method—Ward and the WyCash team needed to have constant experience growing the design of the system little-by-little, so the mechanics of the transformation were well practiced.

• Motive—Ward and team had to understand clearly from the business the importance of making WyCash multi-currency, and to have the courage to start such a seemingly impossible task.

• Opportunity— The combination of comprehensive, confidence-generating tests; a well-factored program; and a programming language that made it possible to isolate design decisions meant that there were few sources of error, and those errors were easy to identify.

You can’t control whether you ever get the motive to multiply the value of your project by spinning technical magic. Method and opportunity, however, are entirely under your control. Ward and his team created method and opportunity by a combination of superior talent, experience, and discipline. Does this mean that if you are not one of the ten best software engineers on the planet and you don’t have a wad of cash in the bank so you can tell your boss to take a hike, you’re going to take the time to do this right, that such moments are forever beyond your reach?

No. You absolutely can place your projects in a position for you to work magic, even if you are a programmer with ordinary skills and you sometimes buckle under and take shortcuts when the pressure builds. Test-driven development is a set of techniques any programmer can follow, that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. If you are a genius, you don’t need these rules. If you are a dolt, the rules won’t help. For the vast majority of us in between, though, following these two simple rules can lead us to work much closer to our potential:

• Write a failing automated test before you write any code

• Remove duplication

How exactly to do this, the subtle gradations in applying these rules, and the lengths to which you can push these two simple rules are the topic of this book. We’ll start with the object Ward created in his moment of inspiration—multi-currency money.

4 CHAPTER 2

## 0102Section I: Money Example

In this section we will develop typical model code completely driven by tests (except when we slip, purely for educational purposes). My goal is for you to see the rhythm of test-driven development:

1. Quickly add a test

2. Run all tests and see the new one fail

3. Make a little change

4. Run all tests and see them all succeed

5. Refactor to remove duplication

The surprises are likely to be:

• How each test can cover a small increment of functionality

• How small and ugly the changes can be to make the new tests run

• How often the tests are run

• How many teensy tiny steps make up the refactorings
