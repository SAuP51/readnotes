## Introduction

Docker helps users to package one application with all its dependencies into one standardized unit for the software development. Unlike other virtual machines, the containers don’t have any high overhead and you can increase the efficiency of underlying resources and system.

It is a common practice in the industry to use VMs (virtual Machines) to run different software applications. The VMS can run these applications in the visitant operating system that runs on the virtual hardware. This hardware is powered by the OS host of the server.

VMs play an important role to provide complete procedure isolation for different applications. The problem of the host OS (operating system) can influence the software running in the operation system of guest and vice versa in different ways.

This isolation may be available at a higher cost and computational overhead disbursed virtualizing hardware for the operating system of guest is essential. Container may use dissimilar approach by leveraging the mechanics of the operating system of host and the containers offer maximum isolation of the virtual machines at one fraction of your computing power.

Rise of Docker is nothing that short of spectacular. The containers are not new technology because these also get conventional attention. The standard APIs make it easy to use containers and create a unique method for the public to collaborate all the way around libraries of the containers.

Docker plays an important role to change the face of technology landscape. In an article of “The Register”, they claim that the Google runs more than two billion containers in one week.

In this book, you will read about Docker, its uses and procedure to use it. This book proves helpful for beginners to get started with Docker.

## Conclusion

Docker is designed for different applications and container. These containers are good for developers to develop codes and make their own assignments. There are different tools in docker for your assistance and you can use these tools to create different things.

This open source program is good to automate the deployment of software and container with extra layer of abstraction and automation. In this book, you will find useful details about docker and containers.
