## Preface

The response of students and teachers to the ﬁrst four editions of Linear Algebra and Its Applications has been most gratifying. This Fifth Edition provides substantial support both for teaching and for using technology in the course. As before, the text provides a modern elementary introduction to linear algebra and a broad selection of interesting applications. The material is accessible to students with the maturity that should come from successful completion of two semesters of college-level mathematics, usually calculus.

The main goal of the text is to help students master the basic concepts and skills they will use later in their careers. The topics here follow the recommendations of the Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group, which were based on a careful investigation of the real needs of the students and a consensus among professionals in many disciplines that use linear algebra. We hope this course will be one of the most useful and interesting mathematics classes taken by undergraduates.

### 1. WHAT'S NEW IN THIS EDITION

The main goals of this revision were to update the exercises, take advantage of improvements in technology, and provide more support for conceptual learning.

1. Support for the Fifth Edition is offered through MyMathLab. MyMathLab, from Pearson, is the world’s leading online resource in mathematics, integrating interactive homework, assessment, and media in a ﬂexible, easy-to-use format. Students submit homework online for instantaneous feedback, support, and assessment. This system works particularly well for computation-based skills. Many additional resources are also provided through the MyMathLab web site.

2. The Fifth Edition of the text is available in an interactive electronic format. Using the CDF player, a free Mathematica player available from Wolfram, students can interact with ﬁgures and experiment with matrices by looking at numerous examples with just the click of a button. The geometry of linear algebra comes alive through these interactive ﬁgures. Students are encouraged to develop conjectures through experimentation and then verify that their observations are correct by examining the relevant theorems and their proofs. The resources in the interactive version of the text give students the opportunity to play with mathematical objects and ideas much as we do with our own research. Files for Wolfram CDF Player are also available for classroom presentations.

3. The Fifth Edition includes additional support for concept- and proof-based learning. Conceptual Practice Problems and their solutions have been added so that most sections now have a proof- or concept-based example for students to review. Additional guidance has also been added to some of the proofs of theorems in the body of the textbook.

4. More than 25 percent of the exercises are new or updated, especially the computational exercises. The exercise sets remain one of the most important features of this book, and these new exercises follow the same high standard of the exercise sets from the past four editions. They are crafted in a way that reﬂects the substance of each of the sections they follow, developing the students’ conﬁdence while challenging them to practice and generalize the new ideas they have encountered.

### 2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES

Early Introduction of Key Concepts

Many fundamental ideas of linear algebra are introduced within the ﬁrst seven lectures, in the concrete setting of R n , and then gradually examined from different points of view. Later generalizations of these concepts appear as natural extensions of familiar ideas, visualized through the geometric intuition developed in Chapter 1. A major achievement of this text is that the level of difﬁculty is fairly even throughout the course.

A Modern View of Matrix Multiplication

Good notation is crucial, and the text reﬂects the way scientists and engineers actually use linear algebra in practice. The deﬁnitions and proofs focus on the columns of a matrix rather than on the matrix entries. A central theme is to view a matrix–vector product Ax as a linear combination of the columns of A. This modern approach simpliﬁes many arguments, and it ties vector space ideas into the study of linear systems.

Linear Transformations

Linear transformations form a “thread” that is woven into the fabric of the text. Their use enhances the geometric ﬂavor of the text. In Chapter 1, for instance, linear transformations provide a dynamic and graphical view of matrix–vector multiplication.

Eigenvalues and Dynamical Systems

Eigenvalues appear fairly early in the text, in Chapters 5 and 7. Because this material is spread over several weeks, students have more time than usual to absorb and review these critical concepts. Eigenvalues are motivated by and applied to discrete and continuous dynamical systems, which appear in Sections 1.10, 4.8, and 4.9, and in ﬁve sections of Chapter 5. Some courses reach Chapter 5 after about ﬁve weeks by covering Sections 2.8 and 2.9 instead of Chapter 4. These two optional sections present all the vector space concepts from Chapter 4 needed for Chapter 5.

Orthogonality and Least-Squares Problems

These topics receive a more comprehensive treatment than is commonly found in beginning texts. The Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group has emphasized the need for a substantial unit on orthogonality and least-squares problems, because orthogonality plays such an important role in computer calculations and numerical linear algebra and because inconsistent linear systems arise so often in practical work.

### 3. PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES

Applications

A broad selection of applications illustrates the power of linear algebra to explain fundamental principles and simplify calculations in engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, biology, economics, and statistics. Some applications appear in separate sections; others are treated in examples and exercises. In addition, each chapter opens with an introductory vignette that sets the stage for some application of linear algebra and provides a motivation for developing the mathematics that follows. Later, the text returns to that application in a section near the end of the chapter.

A Strong Geometric Emphasis

Every major concept in the course is given a geometric interpretation, because many students learn better when they can visualize an idea. There are substantially more drawings here than usual, and some of the ﬁgures have never before appeared in a linear algebra text. Interactive versions of these ﬁgures, and more, appear in the electronic version of the textbook.

Examples

This text devotes a larger proportion of its expository material to examples than do most linear algebra texts. There are more examples than an instructor would ordinarily present in class. But because the examples are written carefully, with lots of detail, students can read them on their own.

Theorems and Proofs

Important results are stated as theorems. Other useful facts are displayed in tinted boxes, for easy reference. Most of the theorems have formal proofs, written with the beginner student in mind. In a few cases, the essential calculations of a proof are exhibited in a carefully chosen example. Some routine veriﬁcations are saved for exercises, when they will beneﬁt students.

Practice Problems

A few carefully selected Practice Problems appear just before each exercise set. Complete solutions follow the exercise set. These problems either focus on potential trouble spots in the exercise set or provide a “warm-up” for the exercises, and the solutions often contain helpful hints or warnings about the homework.

Exercises

The abundant supply of exercises ranges from routine computations to conceptual questions that require more thought. A good number of innovative questions pinpoint conceptual difﬁculties that we have found on student papers over the years. Each exercise set is carefully arranged in the same general order as the text; homework assignments are readily available when only part of a section is discussed. A notable feature of the exercises is their numerical simplicity. Problems “unfold” quickly, so students spend little time on numerical calculations. The exercises concentrate on teaching understanding rather than mechanical calculations. The exercises in the Fifth Edition maintain the integrity of the exercises from previous editions, while providing fresh problems for students and instructors.

Exercises marked with the symbol [M] are designed to be worked with the aid of a “Matrix program” (a computer program, such as MATLAB ® , Maple TM , Mathematica ® , MathCad ® , or Derive TM , or a programmable calculator with matrix capabilities, such as those manufactured by Texas Instruments).

True/False Questions

To encourage students to read all of the text and to think critically, we have developed 300 simple true/false questions that appear in 33 sections of the text, just after the computational problems. They can be answered directly from the text, and they prepare students for the conceptual problems that follow. Students appreciate these questions—after they get used to the importance of reading the text carefully. Based on class testing and discussions with students, we decided not to put the answers in the text. (The Study Guide tells the students where to ﬁnd the answers to the odd-numbered questions.) An additional 150 true/false questions (mostly at the ends of chapters) test understanding of the material. The text does provide simple T/F answers to most of these questions, but it omits the justiﬁcations for the answers (which usually require some thought).

Writing Exercises

An ability to write coherent mathematical statements in English is essential for all students of linear algebra, not just those who may go to graduate school in mathematics. The text includes many exercises for which a written justiﬁcation is part of the answer. Conceptual exercises that require a short proof usually contain hints that help a student get started. For all odd-numbered writing exercises, either a solution is included at the back of the text or a hint is provided and the solution is given in the Study Guide, described below.

Computational Topics

The text stresses the impact of the computer on both the development and practice of linear algebra in science and engineering. Frequent Numerical Notes draw attention to issues in computing and distinguish between theoretical concepts, such as matrix inversion, and computer implementations, such as LU factorizations.

### 4. WEB SUPPORT

MyMathLab–Online Homework and Resources

Support for the Fifth Edition is offered through MyMathLab (www.mymathlab.com). MyMathLab from Pearson is the world’s leading online resource in mathematics, integrating interactive homework, assessment, and media in a ﬂexible, easy-to-use format. MyMathLab contains hundreds of algorithmically generated exercises that mirror those in the textbook. Students submit homework online for instantaneous feedback, support, and assessment. This system works particularly well for supporting computation-based skills. Many additional resources are also provided through the MyMathLab web site.

Interactive Textbook

The Fifth Edition of the text is available in an interactive electronic format within MyMathLab. Using Wolfram CDF Player, a free Mathematica player available from Wolfram (www.wolfram.com/player), students can interact with ﬁgures and experiment with matrices by looking at numerous examples. The geometry of linear algebra comes alive through these interactive ﬁgures. Students are encouraged to develop conjectures

through experimentation, then verify that their observations are correct by examining the relevant theorems and their proofs. The resources in the interactive version of the text give students the opportunity to interact with mathematical objects and ideas much as we do with our own research.

This web site at www.pearsonhighered.com/lay contains all of the support material referenced below. These materials are also available within MyMathLab.

Review Material

Review sheets and practice exams (with solutions) cover the main topics in the text. They come directly from courses we have taught in the past years. Each review sheet identiﬁes key deﬁnitions, theorems, and skills from a speciﬁed portion of the text.

Applications by Chapters

The web site contains seven Case Studies, which expand topics introduced at the beginning of each chapter, adding real-world data and opportunities for further exploration. In addition, more than 20 Application Projects either extend topics in the text or introduce new applications, such as cubic splines, airline ﬂight routes, dominance matrices in sports competition, and error-correcting codes. Some mathematical applications are integration techniques, polynomial root location, conic sections, quadric surfaces, and extrema for functions of two variables. Numerical linear algebra topics, such as condition numbers, matrix factorizations, and the QR method for ﬁnding eigenvalues, are also included. Woven into each discussion are exercises that may involve large data sets (and thus require technology for their solution).

Getting Started with Technology

If your course includes some work with MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, or TI calculators, the Getting Started guides provide a “quick start guide” for students.

Technology-speciﬁc projects are also available to introduce students to software and calculators. They are available on www.pearsonhighered.com/lay and within MyMathLab. Finally, the Study Guide provides introductory material for ﬁrst-time technology users.

Data Files

Hundreds of ﬁles contain data for about 900 numerical exercises in the text, Case Studies, and Application Projects. The data are available in a variety of formats—for MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, and the Texas Instruments graphing calculators. By allowing students to access matrices and vectors for a particular problem with only a few keystrokes, the data ﬁles eliminate data entry errors and save time on homework. These data ﬁles are available for download at www.pearsonhighered.com/lay and MyMathLab.

Projects

Exploratory projects for Mathematica, TM Maple, and MATLAB invite students to discover basic mathematical and numerical issues in linear algebra. Written by experienced faculty members, these projects are referenced by the icon WEB at appropriate points in the text. The projects explore fundamental concepts such as the column space, diagonalization, and orthogonal projections; several projects focus on numerical issues such as ﬂops, iterative methods, and the SVD; and a few projects explore applications such as Lagrange interpolation and Markov chains.

### 5. SUPPLEMENTS

Study Guide

A printed version of the Study Guide is available at low cost. It is also available electronically within MyMathLab. The Guide is designed to be an integral part of the course. The icon SG in the text directs students to special subsections of the Guide that suggest how to master key concepts of the course. The Guide supplies a detailed solution to every third odd-numbered exercise, which allows students to check their work. A complete explanation is provided whenever an odd-numbered writing exercise has only a “Hint” in the answers. Frequent “Warnings” identify common errors and show how to prevent them. MATLAB boxes introduce commands as they are needed. Appendixes in the Study Guide provide comparable information about Maple, Mathematica, and TI graphing calculators (ISBN: 0-321-98257-6).

Instructor’s Edition

For the convenience of instructors, this special edition includes brief answers to all exercises. A Note to the Instructor at the beginning of the text provides a commentary on the design and organization of the text, to help instructors plan their courses. It also describes other support available for instructors (ISBN: 0-321-98261-4).

Instructor’s Technology Manuals

Each manual provides detailed guidance for integrating a speciﬁc software package or graphing calculator throughout the course, written by faculty who have already used the technology with this text. The following manuals are available to qualiﬁed instructors through the Pearson Instructor Resource Center, www.pearsonhighered.com/irc and MyMathLab: MATLAB (ISBN: 0-321-98985-6), Maple (ISBN: 0-134-04726-5), Mathematica (ISBN: 0-321-98975-9), and TI-83C/89 (ISBN: 0-321-98984-8).

Instructor’s Solutions Manual

The Instructor’s Solutions Manual (ISBN 0-321-98259-2) contains detailed solutions for all exercises, along with teaching notes for many sections. The manual is available electronically for download in the Instructor Resource Center (www.pearsonhighered. com/lay) and MyMathLab.

PowerPoint ® Slides and Other Teaching Tools

A brisk pace at the beginning of the course helps to set the tone for the term. To get quickly through the ﬁrst two sections in fewer than two lectures, consider using PowerPoint ® slides (ISBN 0-321-98264-9). They permit you to focus on the process of row reduction rather than to write many numbers on the board. Students can receive a condensed version of the notes, with occasional blanks to ﬁll in during the lecture. (Many students respond favorably to this gesture.) The PowerPoint slides are available for 25 core sections of the text. In addition, about 75 color ﬁgures from the text are available as PowerPoint slides. The PowerPoint slides are available for download at www.pearsonhighered.com/irc. Interactive ﬁgures are available as Wolfram CDF Player ﬁles for classroom demonstrations. These ﬁles provide the instructor with the opportunity to bring the geometry alive and to encourage students to make conjectures by looking at numerous examples. The ﬁles are available exclusively within MyMathLab.

TestGen

TestGen (www.pearsonhighered.com/testgen) enables instructors to build, edit, print, and administer tests using a computized bank of questions developed to cover all the objectives of the text. TestGen is algorithmically based, allowing instructors to create multiple, but equivalent, versions of the same question or test with the click of a button. Instructors can also modify test bank questions or add new questions. The software and test bank are available for download from Pearson Education’s online catalog. (ISBN: 0-321-98260-6)

## A Note to Students

This course is potentially the most interesting and worthwhile undergraduate mathematics course you will complete. In fact, some students have written or spoken to us after graduation and said that they still use this text occasionally as a reference in their careers at major corporations and engineering graduate schools. The following remarks offer some practical advice and information to help you master the material and enjoy the course.

In linear algebra, the concepts are as important as the computations. The simple numerical exercises that begin each exercise set only help you check your understanding of basic procedures. Later in your career, computers will do the calculations, but you will have to choose the calculations, know how to interpret the results, and then explain the results to other people. For this reason, many exercises in the text ask you to explain or justify your calculations. A written explanation is often required as part of the answer. For odd-numbered exercises, you will ﬁnd either the desired explanation or at least a good hint. You must avoid the temptation to look at such answers before you have tried to write out the solution yourself. Otherwise, you are likely to think you understand something when in fact you do not.

To master the concepts of linear algebra, you will have to read and reread the text carefully. New terms are in boldface type, sometimes enclosed in a deﬁnition box. A glossary of terms is included at the end of the text. Important facts are stated as theorems or are enclosed in tinted boxes, for easy reference. We encourage you to read the ﬁrst ﬁve pages of the Preface to learn more about the structure of this text. This will give you a framework for understanding how the course may proceed.

In a practical sense, linear algebra is a language. You must learn this language the same way you would a foreign language—with daily work. Material presented in one section is not easily understood unless you have thoroughly studied the text and worked the exercises for the preceding sections. Keeping up with the course will save you lots of time and distress!

Numerical Notes

We hope you read the Numerical Notes in the text, even if you are not using a computer or graphing calculator with the text. In real life, most applications of linear algebra involve numerical computations that are subject to some numerical error, even though that error may be extremely small. The Numerical Notes will warn you of potential difﬁculties in using linear algebra later in your career, and if you study the notes now, you are more likely to remember them later.

If you enjoy reading the Numerical Notes, you may want to take a course later in numerical linear algebra. Because of the high demand for increased computing power, computer scientists and mathematicians work in numerical linear algebra to develop faster and more reliable algorithms for computations, and electrical engineers design faster and smaller computers to run the algorithms. This is an exciting ﬁeld, and your ﬁrst course in linear algebra will help you prepare for it.

Study Guide

To help you succeed in this course, we suggest that you purchase the Study Guide (www.mypearsonstore.com; 0-321-98257-6). It is available electronically within MyMathLab. Not only will it help you learn linear algebra, it also will show you how to study mathematics. At strategic points in your textbook, the icon SG will direct you to special subsections in the Study Guide entitled “Mastering Linear Algebra Concepts.” There you will ﬁnd suggestions for constructing effective review sheets of key concepts. The act of preparing the sheets is one of the secrets to success in the course, because you will construct links between ideas. These links are the “glue” that enables you to build a solid foundation for learning and remembering the main concepts in the course.

The Study Guide contains a detailed solution to every third odd-numbered exercise, plus solutions to all odd-numbered writing exercises for which only a hint is given in the Answers section of this book. The Guide is separate from the text because you must learn to write solutions by yourself, without much help. (We know from years of experience that easy access to solutions in the back of the text slows the mathematical development of most students.) The Guide also provides warnings of common errors and helpful hints that call attention to key exercises and potential exam questions.

If you have access to technology—MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, or a TI graphing calculator—you can save many hours of homework time. The Study Guide is your “lab manual” that explains how to use each of these matrix utilities. It introduces new commands when they are needed. You can download from the web site www.pearsonhighered.com/lay the data for more than 850 exercises in the text. (With a few keystrokes, you can display any numerical homework problem on your screen.) Special matrix commands will perform the computations for you!

What you do in your ﬁrst few weeks of studying this course will set your pattern for the term and determine how well you ﬁnish the course. Please read “How to Study Linear Algebra” in the Study Guide as soon as possible. Many students have found the strategies there very helpful, and we hope you will, too.
