The rain is pouring down and shelter is a few hundred yards away. Do you get less wet by running? On the one hand, running means less time for raindrops to hit you. On the other hand, running means that the raindrops come toward you more directly and therefore more rapidly. The resolution is not obvious‚Äîuntil you apply the new tool of this chapter: symmetry and conservation. (In Section 3.1.1, we'll resolve this run-in-the-rain question.) 3.1 Invariants

We use symmetry and conservation whenever we find a quantity that, despite the surrounding complexity, does not change. This conserved quantity is called an invariant. Finding invariants simplifies many problems.

Our first invariant appeared unannounced in Section 1.2 when we estimated the carrying capacity of a lane of highway. The carrying capacity‚Äîthe rate at which cars flow down the lane‚Äîdepends on the separation between the cars and on their speed. We could have tried to estimate each quantity and then the carrying capacity. However, the separation between cars and the cars' speeds vary greatly, so these estimates are hard to make reliably.

3 Symmetry and conservation

Instead, we invoked the 2-second following rule. As long as drivers obey it, the separation between cars equals 2 seconds of driving. Therefore, one car flows by every 2 seconds‚Äîwhich is the lane's carrying capacity (in cars per time). By finding an invariant, we simplified a complex, changing process.

When there is change, look for what does not change! (This wisdom is from Arthur Engel's Problem-Solving Strategies [12].) 3.1.1 To run or walk in the rain?

We'll practice with this tool by deciding whether to run or walk in the rain.

It's pouring, your umbrella is sitting at home, and home lies a few hundred meters away.

To minimize how wet you become, should you run or walk?

you

Let's answer this question with three simplifications. First, assume that there is no wind, so the raindrops

rain is falling vertically. Second, assume that the v

home

rain is steady. Third, assume that you are a thin sheet: You have zero thickness along the direction toward your house (this approximation was more valid in my youth). Equivalently, your head is protected by a waterproof cap, so you do not care whether raindrops hit your head. You try to minimize just the amount of water hitting your front.

Your only degree of freedom‚Äîthe only parameter that you get to choose‚Äîis your speed. A high speed leaves you in the rain for less time. However, it also makes the rain come at you more directly (more horizontally). But what remains constant, independent of your speed, is the volume of air that you sweep out. Because the rain is steady, that volume contains a fixed number of raindrops, independent of your speed. Only these raindrops hit your front. Therefore, you get equally wet, no matter your speed.

This surprising conclusion is another application of the principle that when there is change, look for what does not change. Here, we could change our speed by choosing to walk or run. Yet no matter what our speed, we sweep out the same volume of air‚Äîour invariant.

Because the conclusion of this invariance analysis, that it makes no difference whether you walk or run, is surprising, you might still harbor a nag-ging doubt. Surely running in the rain, which we do almost as a reflex, provide some advantage over a leisurely stroll.

3.1 Invariants

59

Is it irrational to run to avoid getting wet?

If you are infinitely thin, and are just a rectangle moving in the rain, then the preceding analysis applies: Whether you run or walk, your front will absorb the same number of raindrops. But most of us have a thickness, and the number of drops landing on our head depends on our speed. If your head is exposed and you care how many drops land on your head, then you should run. But if your head is covered, feel free to save your energy and enjoy the stroll. Running won't keep you any dryer.

3.1.2 Tiling a mouse-eaten chessboard

Often a good way to practice a new tool is on a mathematical problem. Then we do not add the complexity of the physical world to the problem of learning a new tool. Here, therefore, is a mathematical problem: a solitaire game.

A mouse comes and eats two diagonally opposite corners out of a standard, 8 √ó 8 chessboard. We have a box of rectangular, 2 √ó 1 dominoes.

Can these dominoes tile the mouse-eaten chessboard? In other words, can we lay down the dominoes to cover every square exactly once (with no empty squares and no overlapping dominoes)?

Placing a domino on the board is one move in this solitaire game. For each move, you choose where to place the domino‚Äîso you have many choices at each move. The number of possible move sequences grows rapidly. Instead of examining all these sequences, we'll look for an invariant: a quantity unchanged by any move of the game.

Because each domino covers one white square and one black square, the following quantity ùêº is invariant (remains fixed): ùêº = uncovered black squares ‚àí uncovered white squares.

(3.1)

On a regular chess board, with 32 white squares and 32 black squares, the initial position has ùêº = 0. The nibbled board has two fewer black squares, so ùêº starts at 30 ‚àí 32 = ‚àí2. In the winning position, all squares are covered, so ùêº = 0. Because ùêº is invariant, we cannot win: The dominoes cannot tile the nibbled board.

Each move in this game changes the chessboard. By finding what does not change, an invariant, we simplified the analysis.

3 Symmetry and conservation

Invariants are powerful partly because they are abstractions. The details of the empty squares‚Äîtheir exact locations‚Äîlie below the abstraction barrier.

Above the barrier, we see only the excess of black over white squares. The abstraction contains all the information we need in order to know that we can never tile the chessboard.

Problem 3.1

Cube solitaire

A cube has numbers at each vertex; all vertices start at 0 except for the lower left corner, which starts at 1. The moves are all of the same form: Pick any edge and increment its two vertices by one. The goal of this solitaire game is to make all vertices multiples of 3.

For example, picking the bottom edge of the front face and then the bottom edge of the back face, makes the following sequence of cube configurations:

‚ü∂

‚ü∂

(3.2)

Although no configuration above wins the game, can you win with a different move sequence? If you can win, give a winning sequence. If you cannot win, prove that you cannot.

Hint: Create analogous but simpler versions of this game.

Problem 3.2

Triplet solitaire

Here is another solitaire game. Start with the triplet (3, 4, 5). At each move, choose any two of the three numbers. Call the choices ùëé and ùëè. Then make the following replacements:

ùëé ‚ü∂ 0.8ùëé ‚àí 0.6ùëè;

(3.3)

ùëè ‚ü∂ 0.6ùëé + 0.8ùëè.

Can you reach (4, 4, 4)? If you can, give a move sequence; otherwise, prove that it is impossible.

Problem 3.3

Triplet-solitaire moves as rotations in space At each step in triplet solitaire (Problem 3.2), there are three possible moves, depending on which pair of numbers from among ùëé, ùëè, and ùëê you choose to replace.

Describe each of the three moves as a rotation in space. That is, for each move, give the rotation axis and the angle of rotation.

Finding the period of a pendulum, even at small amplitudes, requires calculus because of the pendulum's varying speed.

ingly, Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695), called„Äåthe most inge-nious watchmaker of all time„Äç[20, p. 79] by the great physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, analyzed the motion of a pendulum moving in a horizontal circle (a conical pendulum). Project-ing its two-dimensional motion onto a vertical screen produces one-dimensional pendulum motion; thus, the period of the two-dimensional motion is the same as the period of one-dimensional pendulum motion! Use that idea to find the period of a pendulum (without calculus!).

such a move is made, what is invariant?„ÄçAs an example to crystallize our thinking, here are frequencies related to human hearing. Let's graph them using kilohertz (kHz) as the unit. The frequencies then arrange themselves as follows:

low end

high C

20

middle C

Now let's change units from kilohertz to hertz (Hz)‚Äîand keep the 0, 10, and 20 labels at their current positions on the page. This change magnifies every spacing by a factor of 1000: The new 20 hertz is where 20 kilohertz was (about 4 inches or 10 centimeters to the right of the origin), and 20 kilohertz, the high end of human hearing, sits 100 meters to our right‚Äîfar beyond the borders of the page. This new scale is not very useful.

However, we missed the chance to use an invariant: the ratio between frequencies. For example, the ratio between the upper end of human hearing (20 kilohertz) and middle C (262 hertz) is roughly 80. If we use a representation based on ratio rather than absolute difference, then the spacing between frequencies would not change even when we changed the unit.

3 Symmetry and conservation

We have such a representation: logarithms! On a logarithmic scale, a distance corresponds to a ratio rather than a difference. To see the contrast, let's place the numbers from 1 to 10 on a logarithmic scale.

The physical gap between 1 and 2 represents not their difference but rather their ratio, namely 2. According to my ruler, the gap is approximately 3.16

centimeters. Similarly, the physical gap between 2 and 3‚Äîapproximately 1.85 centimeters‚Äîrepresents the smaller ratio 1.5. In contrast to their relative positions on a linear scale, 2 and 3 on a logarithmic scale are closer than 1 and 2 are. On a logarithmic scale, 1 and 2 have the same separation as 2

and 4: Both gaps represent a ratio of 2 and therefore have the same physical size (3.16 centimeters).

Problem 3.5

Practice with ratio thinking

On a logarithmic scale, how does the physical gap between 2 and 8 compare to the gap between 1 and 2? Decide based on your understanding of ratios; then check your reasoning by measuring both gaps.

Problem 3.6

More practice with ratio thinking

Is the gap between 1 and 10 less than twice, equal to twice, or more than twice the gap between 1 and 3? Decide based on your understanding of ratios; then check your reasoning by measuring both gaps.

Problem 3.7

Moving along a logarithmic scale

On the logarithmic scale in the text, the gap between 2 and 3 is approximately 1.85

centimeters. Where do you land if you start at 6 and move 1.85 centimeters right-ward? Decide based on your understanding of ratios; then check your reasoning by using a ruler to find the new location.

Problem 3.8

Extending the scale to the right

On the logarithmic scale in the text, the gap between 1 and 10 is approximately 10.5 centimeters. If the scale were extended to include numbers up to 1000, how large would the gap between 10 and 1000 be?

Problem 3.9

Extending the scale to the left

If the logarithmic scale were extended to include numbers down to 0.01, how far to the left of 1 would you have to place 0.04?

On a logarithmic scale, the frequencies related to hearing arrange themselves as follows:

Acoustic energy fluxes

In acoustics, sound intensity is measured by energy flux, which is measured in decibels (dB)‚Äîa logarithmic representation of watts per square meter. On the decibel scale, 0 decibels corresponds to the reference level of 10‚àí12 watts per square meter.

Every 10 decibels (or 1 bel) represents an increase in energy flux of a factor of 10

(thus, 20 decibels represents a factor-of-100 increase in energy flux).

a. How many watts per square meter is 60 decibels (the sound level of normal conversation)?

b. Place the following energy fluxes on a decibel scale: 10‚àí9 watts per square meter (an empty church), 10‚àí2 watts per square meter (front row at an orchestra concert), and 1 watt per square meter (painfully loud).

Logarithmic scales offer two benefits. First, as we saw explicitly, logarithmic scales incorporate invariance. The second benefit was only implicit in the previous discussion: Logarithmic scales, unlike linear scales, allow us to represent a huge range. For example, if we include power-line hum (50 or 60 hertz) on the linear frequency scale on p. 61, we can hardly distinguish its position from 0 kilohertz. The logarithmic scale has no problem.

Labeling a logarithmic scale

Let's make a scale to represent sizes in the universe, from protons (10‚àí15 meters) to galaxies (1030 meters), with people and bacteria in between.

Logarithmic scales can make otherwise obscure symbolic calculations intuitive. An example is the geometric mean, which we used in Section 1.6 to make gut estimates:

Geometric means also occur in the physical world.

(3.7)

In this symbolic form with a square root, the calculation obscures the fundamental structure of the geometric mean. We first calculate ‚Ñéùê∑, which is an area (and often contains, as it did here, a huge number). Then we take the square root to get back a distance. However, the area has nothing to do with the structure of the problem. It is merely a bookkeeping device.

Bookkeeping devices are useful; they are how you tell a computer what to calculate. However, to understand the calculation, we, as humans, should use a logarithmic scale to represent the distances. This scale captures the structure of the problem.

How can we describe the position of the geometric mean ‚Ñéùê∑ ?

The first clue is that the geometric mean, because it gap endpoints

is a mean, lies somewhere between ‚Ñé and ùê∑. This property is not obvious from the calculation using left ‚Ñé‚Ä¶ ‚Ñéùê∑

‚Ñéùê∑

‚Ñé = ùê∑‚Ñé

the square root. To find where the geometric mean lies, mind the gaps. On a logarithmic scale, a gap right ‚Ñéùê∑ ‚Ä¶ùê∑

ùê∑ = ùê∑

‚Ñéùê∑

‚Ñé

represents the ratio of its endpoints. As shown in the table, the left and right gaps represent the same ratio, namely ùê∑/‚Ñé! Therefore, on the logarithmic scale, the geometric mean lies exactly halfway between ‚Ñé and ùê∑.

Based on this ratio representation, we can rephrase the geometric-mean calculation in a form that we can do mentally.

What distance is as large compared to 4 meters as 12 000 kilometers is compared to it?

For lack of imagination, my first guess is 1 kilometer. It's 12 000 times smaller than the diameter ùê∑ (which is 12 000 kilometers), but only 250 times larger than the height ‚Ñé (4 meters). My guess of 1 kilometer is therefore somewhat too small.

How is a guess of 10 kilometers?

It's 2500 times larger than ‚Ñé, but only 1200 times smaller than ùê∑. I overshot slightly. How about 7 kilometers? It's roughly 1750 times larger than 4 meters, and roughly 1700 times smaller than 12 000 kilometers. Those gaps are close to each other, so 7 kilometers is the approximate geometric mean.

3 Symmetry and conservation

Should all quantities be placed on a logarithmic scale?

No. An illustrative contrast is between size and position. Both quantities have the same units. But size ranges from 0 to ‚àû, whereas position ranges from ‚àí‚àû to ‚àû. Position therefore cannot be placed on a logarithmic scale (where would you put ‚àí1 meter?). In contrast, size (a magnitude) belongs on a logarithmic scale. In general, location parameters, such as position, should not be placed on a logarithmic scale but magnitudes should.

3.2 From invariant to symmetry operation

In the preceding examples, we knew the moves of the game and sought the invariant. In the mouse-eaten chessboard (Section 3.1.2), the moves are putting down a 2√ó1 domino on two adjacent empty squares. The invariant was the difference between empty black and white squares. Often, however, the benefit of invariants lies in the other direction: You know the invariant and seek the moves that preserve it. These moves are called the symmetry operations or simply the symmetries.

We'll first examine this idea in a familiar situation: converting units (Section 3.2.1). Then we'll practice it on a sum solved by the three-year-old Carl Friedrich Gauss (Section 3.2.2) and then by finding maxima and minima (Section 3.2.3).

3.2.1 Converting units

We often convert a quantity from one unit system to another‚Äîfor example, mass from English to metric units or prices from dollars to pounds or euros.

A useful physical conversion is writing energy density‚Äîenergy divided by amount of stuff‚Äîin useful units. Let's start with the reasonable energy unit for a chemical bond, namely the electron volt or eV (Section 2.1). Then a useful unit for energy density is

1 eV

molecule.

(3.8)

This energy density is our invariant. As we convert from one unit system to another, our moves have to preserve the energy density.

What are the legal moves‚Äîthe moves that preserve the energy density?

The legal moves are all ways of multiplying by 1‚Äîfor example, by 2014-09-02 10:51:35 UTC / rev 78ca0ee9dfae

Convert green-light wavelength, 0.5 micrometers (0.5 Œºm), to a frequency in cycles per second (hertz or Hz).

Problem 3.15

Converting frequency to energy

Analogously to how you used the speed of light in Problem 3.14, use Planck's constant ‚Ñé to convert the frequency of green light to an energy in joules (J) and in electron volts (eV). This energy is the energy of a green-light photon.

Problem 3.16

Converting energy to temperature

Use Boltzmann's constant ùëòB to convert the energy of a green-light photon (Problem 3.15) to a temperature (in kelvin). This temperature, except for a factor of 3, is the surface temperature of the Sun!

Conversion factors need not be numerical. Insight often comes from symbolic factors. Here is an example from fluid flow. As we will derive in Section 5.3.2, the drag coefficient ùëêd is defined as the dimensionless ratio ùêπ

In the denominator, the product ùê¥ùëë is the volume of fluid displaced by the object, so ùúåùê¥ùëë is the corresponding mass of fluid. Therefore, the denominator is also

12 √ómassoffluiddisplaced√óùë£2.

(3.18)

The object's speed ùë£ is also approximately the speed given to the displaced fluid (which the object shoved it out of its way). Therefore, the denominator is roughly

12 √ómassoffluiddisplaced√ó(speedofdisplacedfluid)2.

(3.19)

This expression is the kinetic energy given to the displaced fluid. The drag coefficient is therefore roughly the ratio

My tenth-grade chemistry teacher, Mr. McCready, told us that unit conversion was the one idea that we should remember from the entire course.

Almost every problem in the chemistry textbook could be solved by unit conversion, which says something about the quality of the book but also about the power of the method.

3.2.2 Gauss's childhood sum

A classic example of going from the invariant to the symmetry is the following story of the young Carl Friedrich Gauss. Although maybe just a legend, the story is so instructive that it ought to be true. Once upon a time, when Gauss was 3 years old, his schoolteacher, wanting to occupy the students, assigned them to compute the sum

ùëÜ = 1 + 2 + 3 + ‚ãØ + 100,

(3.21)

and sat back to enjoy the break. In a few minutes, Gauss returned with an answer of 5050.

3 Symmetry and conservation

Was Gauss right? If so, how did he compute the sum so quickly?

Gauss saw that the sum‚Äîthe invariant‚Äîis unchanged when the terms are added backward, from highest to lowest:

1 + 2 + 3 + ‚ãØ + 100 = 100 + 99 + 98 + ‚ãØ + 1.

(3.22)

Then he added the two versions of the sum, the original and the reflected: 1 + 2 + 3 + ‚ãØ + 100 = ùëÜ

+ 100 + 99 + 98 + ‚ãØ + 1 = ùëÜ

101 + 101 + 101 + ‚ãØ + 101 = 2ùëÜ.

In this form, 2ùëÜ is easy to compute: It contains 100 copies of 101. Therefore, 2ùëÜ = 100 √ó 101, and ùëÜ = 50 √ó 101 or 5050‚Äîas the young Gauss claimed. He made the problem so simple by finding a symmetry: a transformation that preserved the invariant.

3.2.3 Finding maxima or minima

To practice finding the symmetry operation, we'll find the maximum of the function 6ùë• ‚àí ùë•2 without using calculus. Calculus is the elephant gun. It can solve many problems, but only after blasting them into the same form (smithereens). Avoiding calculus forces us to use more particular, but more subtle methods‚Äîsuch as symmetry. As Gauss did in summing 1 + 2 + ‚ãØ +

100, let's find a symmetry operation that preserves the essential feature of the problem‚Äînamely, the location of the maximum.

2014-09-02 10:51:35 UTC / rev 78ca0ee9dfae

3.2 From invariant to symmetry operation 71

Symmetry implies moving around an object's pieces. Fortunately, our function 6ùë• ‚àí ùë•2 factors into pieces:

6ùë• ‚àí ùë•2 = ùë•(6 ‚àí ùë•).

(3.25)

This form, along with the idea that multiplication is commutative, suggests the symmetry operation. For if the operation just swaps the two factors, replacing ùë•(6 ‚àí ùë•) with (6 ‚àí ùë•)ùë•, it does not change the location of the maximum. (A parabola has exactly one maximum or minimum.) The symmetry operation that makes the swap is ùë• ‚ü∑ 6 ‚àí ùë•.

(3.26)

It turns 2 into 4 (and vice versa) and 1 into 5 (and vice versa). The only value unchanged (left invariant) by the symmetry operation is ùë• = 3. Therefore, 6ùë• ‚àí ùë•2 has its maximum at ùë• = 3.

maximum

Geometrically, the symmetry operation reflects the graph of 6ùë• ‚àí ùë•2 through the line ùë• = 3. By construction, this symme-6x ‚àí x2

try operation preserves the location of the maximum. Therefore, the maximum has to lie on the line ùë• = 3.

We could have found this maximum in several other ways, so the use of symmetry might seem superfluous or like overkill.

However, it warms us up for the following, more compli-x = 3

cated use. The energy required to fly has two pieces: generating lift, which requires an energy ùê¥/ùë£2, and fighting drag, which requires an energy ùêµùë£2. (ùê¥ and ùêµ are constants that we estimate in Sections 3.6.2 and 4.6.1.)

ùê∏flight = ùê¥

ùë£2 + ùêµùë£2.

(3.27)

To minimize fuel consumption, planes choose their cruising speed to minimize ùê∏flight. More precisely, a cruising speed is selected, and the plane is designed so that this speed minimizes ùê∏flight.

In terms of the constants ùê¥ and ùêµ , what speed minimizes ùê∏ flight?

Like the parabola ùë•(6‚àíùë•), this energy has one extremum. For the parabola, the extremum was a maximum; here, it is a minimum. Also similar to the parabola, this energy has two pieces connected by a commutative operation. For the parabola, the operation was multiplication; here, it is addition.

Continuing the analogy, if we find a symmetry operation that transposes 2014-09-02 10:51:35 UTC / rev 78ca0ee9dfae

72

3 Symmetry and conservation

the two pieces, then the speed preserved by the operation will be the minimum-energy speed.

Finding this symmetry operation is hard to do in one gulp, because it must transpose 1/ùë£2 and ùë£2 and transpose ùê¥ and ùêµ. These two difficulties suggest that we apply divide-and-conquer reasoning: Find a symmetry operation that transposes 1/ùë£2 and ùë£2, and then modify so that it also transposes ùê¥

and ùêµ.

E

To transpose 1/ùë£2 and ùë£2, the symmetry operation is the following:

ùë£ ‚ü∑ 1ùë£.

(3.28)

Now let's restore one of the two constants and modify Eflight

the symmetry operation so that it transposes ùê¥/ùë£2 and Edrag

ùë£2:

Elift

ùë£ ‚ü∑ ùê¥

vmin

v

ùë£ .

(3.29)

Now let's restore the second constant, ùêµ, and find the full symmetry operation that transposes ùê¥/ùë£2 and ùêµùë£2: ùêµ ùë£ ‚ü∑ ùê¥

ùë£ .

(3.30)

Rewriting it as a replacement for ùë£, the symmetry operation becomes ùë£ ‚ü∑ ùê¥/ùêµ

ùë£ .

(3.31)

This symmetry operation transposes the drag energy and lift energy, leaving the total energy ùê∏flight unchanged. Solving for the speed preserved by the symmetry operation gives us the minimum-energy speed: 1/4

ùë£min = (ùê¥ùêµ) .

(3.32)

In Section 4.6.1, once we find ùê¥ and ùêµ in terms of the characteristics of the air (its density) and the plane (such as its wingspan), we can estimate the minimum-energy (cruising) speeds of planes and birds.

Once the pentagon temperature equilibrates, what is the temperature at its center?

A brute-force, analytic solution is difficult. Heat flow is described by the heat equation, a linear second-order partial-differential equation: ùúÖ‚àá2ùëá = ‚àÇùëá

‚àÇùë° ,

(3.33)

where ùëá is the temperature as a function of position and time, and ùúÖ (kappa) is the thermal diffusivity (which we will study in more detail in Chapter 7).

But don't worry: You do not have to understand the equation, only that it is difficult to solve!

80‚ó¶

Once the temperature settles down, the time derivative becomes zero, and the equation simplifies to ùúÖ‚àá2ùëá = 0. However, even this 10‚ó¶

10‚ó¶

simpler equation has solutions only for simple shapes, and the solutions are complicated. For example, the temperature distrib-10‚ó¶

ution on the simpler square sheet is hardly intuitive (the figure shows contour lines spaced every 10‚àò). For a pentagon, the temperature distribution is worse. However, because the pentagon is regular, symmetry might make the solution flow.

What is a useful symmetry operation?

Nature, in the person of the heat equation, does not care about the direction of our coordinate system. Thus, rotating the pentagon about its center does not change the temperature at the center. Therefore, the following five orientations of the pentagon share the same central temperature: 80‚ó¶

3 Symmetry and conservation

Like Gauss adding the two versions of his sum (Section 3.2.2), stack these sheets mentally and add the temperatures that lie on top of each other to make the temperature profile of a new super sheet (adding the temperatures is valid because the heat equation is linear).

=

(3.34)

Each super edge contains one 80‚àò edge and four 10‚àò edges, for a temperature of 120‚àò. The super sheet is a regular pentagon where all edges are at 120‚àò.

Therefore, the temperature throughout the sheet is 120‚àò‚Äîincluding at the center. Because the symmetry operation has helped us construct a much easier problem, we did not have to solve the heat equation.

One more step tells us the temperature in the center of the original sheet.

The symmetry operation rotates the pentagon about its center; when the plates are stacked, the centers align. Each center then contributes one-fifth of the 120‚àò in the center, so the original central temperature is 24‚àò.

To highlight the transferable ideas (abstractions), compare the symmetry solutions to Gauss's sum and to this temperature problem. First, both problems seem complicated. Gauss's sum has many terms, all different; the pentagon problem seems to require solving a difficult differential equation.

Second, both problems contain a symmetry operation. In Gauss's sum, the symmetry operation reversed the order of the terms; for the pentagon, the symmetry operation rotates it by 72‚àò. Finally, the symmetry operation leaves an important quantity unchanged. For Gauss's problem, this quantity is the sum; for the pentagon, it is the central temperature.

When there is change, look for what does not change. Look for invariants and the corresponding symmetries: the operations that preserve the invariants.

Here are three examples of bisecting paths:

To set your problem-solving gears in motion, first rank these three bisecting paths according to their lengths.

3.4 Box models and conservation

Invariance underlies a powerful everyday abstraction: box models. We already made a box model in Section 3.1.1, to decide whether to run or walk in the rain. Now let's examine this method further. The simplest kind of box contains a fixed amount of stuff‚Äîperhaps the volume of fluid or the number of students at an ideal university (where every student graduates in a fixed time). Then what goes into the box must come out. This conclusion seems simple, even simplistic, but it has wide application.

3.4.1 Supply and demand

box

For another example of a box model, return to our supply

demand

estimate of US oil usage (Section 1.4). The flow oil

into the box‚Äîthe push or the supply‚Äîis the imported and domestically produced oil. The flow out of the box‚Äîthe pull or the demand‚Äîis the oil usage. The estimate, literally taken, asks for the supply (how much oil is imported and domestically produced). This estimate is difficult. Fortunately, as long as oil does not accumulate in the box (for example, as long as oil is not salted away in underground storage bunkers), then the amount of oil in the box is an invariant, so the supply equals the demand. To estimate the supply, we accordingly estimated the demand. This conservation reasoning is the basis of the following estimate of a market size.

How many taxis are there in Boston, Massachusetts?

For many car-free years, I lived in an old neighborhood of Boston. I often rode in taxis and wondered about the size of the taxi market‚Äîin particular, how many taxis there were. This number seemed hard to estimate, because taxis are scattered throughout the city and hard to count.

The box contains the available taxi driving (mea-supply

demand

sured, for example, as time). It is supplied by taxi driving

(drivers)

(users)

taxi drivers. The demand is due to taxi users. As long as the supply and demand match, we can

estimate the supply by estimating the demand.

For estimating the demand, the starting point is that Boston has roughly 500 000 residents. As a gut estimate, each resident uses maybe one taxi per month, for a 15-minute ride: Boston taxis are expensive; unless one doesn't own a car, it's hard to imagine using them more often than once a month or for longer than 15 minutes. Then the demand is about 105 hours of taxi driving per month:

15 min

105 hr

(3.35)

resident month 60 min

How many taxi drivers will that many monthly hours support?

Taxi drivers work long shifts, maybe 60 hours per week. I'd guess that they carry passengers one-half of that time: 30 hours per week or roughly 100

hours per month. At that pace, 105 hours of monthly demand could be supplied by 1000 taxi drivers or, assuming each taxi is driven by one driver, by 1000 taxis.

What about tourists?

Tourists are very short-term Boston residents, mostly without cars. Tourists, although fewer than residents, use taxis more often and for longer than residents do. To include the tourist contribution to taxi demand, I'll simply double the previous estimate to get 2000 taxis.

This estimate can be checked reliably, because Boston is one of the United States cities where taxis may pick up passengers only with a special permit, the medallion. The number of medallions is strictly controlled, so medallions cost a fortune. For about 60 years, their number was restricted to 1525, until a 10-year court battle got the limit raised by 260, to about 1800.

3.4 Box models and conservation 77

The estimate of 2000 may seem more accurate than it deserves. However, chance favors the prepared mind. We prepared by using good tools: a box model and divide-and-conquer reasoning. In making your own estimates, have confidence in the tools, and expect your estimates to be at least half decent. You will thereby find the courage to start: Optimism oils the rails of estimation.

3.4.2 Flux

Flows, such as the demand for oil or the supply of taxi cabs, are rates‚Äîan amount per time. Physical flows are also rates, but they live in a geometry. This embedding allows us to de- flow rate area

fine a related quantity: flux.

amount

flux of stuff ‚â° rate

area = amount of stuff

area √ó time .

(3.37)

For example, particle flux is the rate at which particles (say, molecules) pass through a surface perpendicular to the flow, divided by the area of the surface. Dividing by the surface area, an operation with no counterpart in nonphysical flows (for example, in the demand for taxicabs), makes flux more invariant and useful than rate. For if you double the surface area, you double the rate. This proportionality is not newsworthy, and usually doesn't add insight, only clutter. When there is change, look for what does not change: Even when the area changes, flux does not.

What kind of flux (flux of what?) is current density (current per area)?

The definition of flux leads to a simple and important connection between flux and flow speed. Imagine a tube of stuff (for example, molecules) with cross-sectional area ùê¥. The stuff flows through the tube at a speed ùë£.

In a time ùë° , how much stuff leaves the tube?

The general relation will be crucial in estimating the power required to fly (Section 3.6) and in understanding heat conduction (Section 7.4.2).

3.4.3 Average solar flux

An important flux is energy flux: the rate at which energy passes through a surface, divided by the area of the surface. Here, rate means energy per time, or power. Therefore, energy flux is power per area. An energy flux essential to life is the solar flux: the solar power per area falling on Earth.

This flux drives most of our weather. At the top of the atmosphere, looking directly toward the sun, the flux is roughly ùêπ = 1300 watts per square meter.

However, this flux is not evenly distributed over the surface of the earth.

The simplest reason is night and day. On the night side of the Earth, the solar flux is zero. More subtly, different latitudes have different solar fluxes: The equatorial regions are warmer than the poles because they receive more solar flux than the poles do.

What is the solar flux averaged over the whole Earth?

We can find the average flux using a box model (a sunlight

Earth

conservation argument). Here is sunlight coming to the Earth (with parallel rays, because the Sun is so far away). Hold a disk with radius ùëÖEarth perpendicular to the sunlight so that it blocks all sunlight that the Earth otherwise would get. The disk absorbs a power that we can find from the energy flux: power = energy flux √ó area = ùêπùúãùëÖ2Earth,

(3.42)

where ùêπ is the solar flux. Now spread this power over the whole Earth, which has surface area 4ùúãùëÖ2Earth:

Earth

Because one-half of the Earth is in night, averaging over the night and day-light parts of the earth accounts for a factor of 2. Therefore, averaging over latitudes must account for another factor of 2 (Problem 3.29).

Problem 3.29

Averaging solar flux over all latitudes

Integrate the solar flux over the whole sunny side of the Earth, accounting for the varying angles between the incident sunlight and the surface. Check that the result agrees with the result of the box model.

3 Symmetry and conservation

The result is roughly 325 watts per square meter. This average flux slightly overestimates what the Earth receives at ground level, because not all of the 1300 watts per square meter hitting the top of the atmosphere reaches the surface. Roughly 30 percent gets reflected near the top of the atmosphere (by clouds). The surviving amount is about 1000 watts per square meter.

Averaged over the surface of the Earth, it becomes 250 watts per square meter (which then goes into the surface and the atmosphere), or approximately ùêπ/5, where ùêπ is the flux at the top of the atmosphere.

3.4.4 Rainfall

These 250 watts per square meter determine characteristics of our weather that are essential to life: the average surface temperature and the average rainfall. You get to estimate the surface temperature in Problem 5.43, once you learn the reasoning tool of dimensional analysis. Here, we will estimate the average rainfall.

If the box representing the atmosphere holds a evaporation water in rainfall

fixed amount of water‚Äîand over a long timescale, atmosphere

the amount is constant (it is our invariant)‚Äîthen what goes into the box must come out of the box.

The inflow is evaporation; the outflow is rain. Therefore, to estimate the rainfall, estimate the evaporation‚Äîwhich is produced by the solar flux.

How much rain falls on Earth?

Rainfall is measured as a height of water per time‚Äîtypically, inches or millimeters per year. To estimate global average rainfall, convert the supply of solar energy to the supply of rainwater. In other words, convert power per area to height per time. The structure of the conversion is power

height

area √ó ?? = time ,

(3.44)

where ?/? represents the conversion factor that we need to determine. To find what this conversion factor represents, we multiply both sides by area per power. The result is

?

area √ó height

? = power √ó time = volume

What physical quantity could this volume per energy be?

3.4 Box models and conservation 81

We are trying to determine the amount of rain, so the volume in the numerator must be the volume of rain. Evaporating the water requires energy, so the energy in the denominator must be the energy required to evaporate that much water. The conversion factor is then the reciprocal of the heat of vaporization of water ùêøvap, but expressed as an energy per volume. In Section 1.7.3, we estimated ùêøvap as an energy per mass. To make it an energy per volume, just multiply by a mass per volume‚Äînamely, by ùúåwater: energy

waterùêøvap

For the numerator, we cannot just use ùêπ, the full solar flux at the top of the atmosphere. Rather, the numerator incorporates several dimensionless ratios that account for the hoops through which sunlight must jump in order to reach the surface and evaporate water:

0.25

averaging the intercepted flux over the whole surface of the Earth (Section 3.4.3)

0.7

the fraction not reflected at the top of the atmosphere 0.7

of the sunlight reaching the surface, the fraction reaching the oceans (the other 30 percent mostly warms land)

Explaining the difference between ocean and land rainfall Why is the average rainfall over land lower than over the ocean?

3.4.5 Residence times

Because of evaporation, the atmosphere contains a lot of water: roughly 1.3√ó1016 kilograms‚Äîas vapor, liquid, and solid. This mass tells us the residence time: how long a water molecule remains in the atmosphere before it falls back to the Earth as precipitation (the overall name for rain, snow, or hail). The estimate will illustrate a new way to use box models.

Here is the box representing the water in the atmosphere (assumed to need only one box). The box is filled by evaporation and emptied by rainfall.

return to the Earth as precipitation. In the box model, the time is the time to completely fill the box. This time constant, denoted ùúè, is mass of water in the atmosphere

ùúè = rate of inflow or outflow, as a mass per time .

(3.50)

The numerator is ùëöwater. For the denominator, we convert rainfall, which is a speed (for example, in meters per year), to a mass flow rate (mass per time). Let's name the rainfall speed ùë£rainfall. The corresponding mass flux is, using our results from Section 3.4.2, ùúåwaterùë£rainfall: mass flux = density

‚èü‚èü‚èü‚èü‚èü √ó flow speed

Flux is flow per area, so we multiply mass flux by the Earth's surface area ùê¥Earth to get the mass flow:

There are two ways to evaluate this time: the direct but less insightful method, and the less direct but more insightful method. Let's first do the direct method, so that we at least have an estimate for ùúè: ùúè ‚àº

which is roughly 10 days. Therefore, after evaporating, water remains in the atmosphere for roughly 10 days.

For the less direct but more insightful method, notice which quantities are not reasonably sized‚Äîthat is, not graspable by our minds‚Äînamely, ùëöwater and ùê¥Earth. But the combination ùëöwater/ùúåwaterùê¥Earth is reasonably sized: ùëöwater

This length, 2.5 centimeters, has a physical interpretation. If all water, snow, and vapor fell out of the atmosphere to the surface of the Earth, it would form an additional global ocean 2.5 centimeters deep.

Rainfall takes away 100 centimeters per year. Therefore, draining this ocean, with a 2.5-centimeter depth, requires 2.5√ó10‚àí2 years or about 10 days. This time is, once again, the residence time of water in the atmosphere.

3.5 Drag using conservation of energy

A box model will next help us estimate drag forces. Drag, one of the most difficult subjects in physics, is also one of the most important forces in everyday life. If it weren't for drag, bicycling, flying, and driving would be a breeze. Because of drag, locomotion requires energy. Rigorously calculating a drag force requires solving the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations: (ùêØ‚ãÖ‚àá)ùêØ + ‚àÇùêØ

‚àÇùë° = ‚àí1ùúå‚àáùëù + ùúà‚àá2ùêØ.

(3.56)

They are coupled, nonlinear, partial-differential equations. You could read many volumes describing the mathematics to solve these equations. Even then, solutions are known only in a few circumstances‚Äîfor example, a sphere moving slowly in a viscous fluid or moving at any speed in a nonviscous fluid. However, a nonviscous fluid‚Äîwhat Feynman [14, Section II-40-2], quoting John von Neumann, rightly disparages as„Äådry water„Äç‚Äîis particularly irrelevant to real life because viscosity is the cause of drag, so a zero-viscosity solution predicts zero drag! Using a box model and conservation of energy is a simple and insightful alternative.

3.5.1 Box model for drag

We will first estimate the energy lost to drag as an ob-Acs

v

ject moves through a fluid, as in Section 3.2.1. From the energy, we will find the drag force. To quantify the the d

problem, imagine pushing an object of cross-sectional area ùê¥cs at speed ùë£ for a distance ùëë. The object sweeps out a tube of fluid.

(The tube length ùëë is arbitrary, but it will cancel out of the force.) How much energy is consumed by drag?

Energy is consumed because the object gives kinetic energy to the fluid (say, water or air); viscosity, as we will model in Section 6.4.4, then turns this energy into heat. The kinetic energy depends on the mass of the fluid and on the speed it is given. The mass of fluid in the tube is ùúåùê¥csùëë, where ùúå is the fluid density. The speed imparted to the fluid is roughly the speed of the object, which is ùë£. Therefore, the kinetic energy given to the fluid is roughly ùúåùê¥csùë£2ùëë:

ùê∏kinetic ‚àº ùúåùê¥csùëë

‚èü √ó ùë£2 = ùúåùê¥csùë£2ùëë.

3.5 Drag using conservation of energy 85

This calculation ignores the factor of one-half in the definition of kinetic energy. However, the other approximations, such as assuming that only the swept-out fluid is affected or that all the swept-out fluid gets speed ùë£, are at least as inaccurate. For this rough calculation, there is little point in including the factor of one-half.

This kinetic energy is roughly the energy converted into heat. Therefore, the energy lost to drag is roughly ùúåùê¥csùë£2ùëë. The drag force is then given by energy lost to drag

As expected, the arbitrary distance ùëë has canceled out.

3.5.2 Testing the analysis with a home experiment To test this analysis, try the following home experiment. Photocopy or print this page at 200 percent enlargement (a factor of 2 larger in width and height), cut out the template, and tape the two straight edges together to make a cone:

3.5 cm

We could use many other shapes. However, a cone is easy to construct, and also falls without swishing back and forth (as a sheet of paper would) or flipping over (as long as you drop it point down).

We'll test the analysis by predicting the cone's terminal speed: that is, its steady speed while falling. When the cone is falling at this constant speed, its acceleration is zero, so the net force on it is, by Newton's second law, also zero. Thus, the drag force ùêπdrag equals the cone's weight ùëöùëî

(where ùëö is the cone's mass and ùëî is the gravitational acceleration): ùúåairùë£2ùê¥cs ‚àº ùëöùëî.

The terminal speed thus reveals the drag force. (Even though the drag force equals the weight, the left side is only an approximation to the drag force, so we connect the left and right sides with a single approximation sign ‚àº.) The terminal speed ùë£term is then

Here, ùê¥paper is the area of the cone template; and the areal density ùúépaper, named in analogy to the regular (volume) density, is the mass per area of paper. Although areal density seems like a strange quantity to define, it is used worldwide to describe the„Äåweight„Äçof different papers.

The quotient ùëö/ùê¥cs contains the ratio ùê¥paper/ùê¥cs. Rather than estimating both areas and finding their ratio, let's estimate the ratio directly.

How does the cross-sectional area ùê¥ cs compare to the area of the paper?

Because the cone's circumference is three-quarters of the circum-r

ference of the full circle, its cross-sectional radius is three-quar-co

ters of the radius ùëü of the template circle. Therefore, ne circumference

ùê¥cs = ùúã (34ùëü) .

(3.64)

Because the template is three-quarters of a full circle, ùê¥paper = 34ùúãùëü2.

(3.65)

The paper area has one factor of three-quarters, whereas the cross-sectional area has two factors of three-quarters, so ùê¥paper/ùê¥cs = 4/3. Now ùë£term simplifies as follows:

3.5 Drag using conservation of energy 87

Is this ùúé paper consistent with the estimates for a dollar bill in Section 1.1?

There we estimated that the thickness ùë° of a dollar bill, or of paper in general, is approximately 0.01 centimeters. The regular (volume) density ùúå would then be 0.8 grams per cubic centimeter:

This density, slightly below the density of water, is a good guess for the density of paper, which originates as wood (which barely floats on water).

Therefore, our estimate in Section 1.1 is consistent with the proposed areal density of 80 grams per square meter.

After putting in the constants, the cone's terminal speed is predicted to be roughly 0.9 meters per second:

To test the prediction and, with it, the analysis justifying it, I held the cone slightly above my head, from about 2 meters high. After I let the cone go, it fell for almost exactly 2 seconds before it hit the ground‚Äîfor a speed of roughly 1 meter per second, very close to the prediction. Box models and conservation triumph again!

3.5.3 Cycling

In introducing the analysis of drag, I said that drag is one of the most important physical effects in everyday life. Our analysis of drag will now help us understand the physics of a fantastically efficient form of locomotion‚Äîcycling (for its efficiency, see Problem 3.34).

What is the world-record cycling speed?

The first task is to define the kind of world record. Let's analyze cycling on level ground using a regular bicycle, even though faster speeds are possible riding downhill or on special bicycles. In bicycling, energy goes into rolling resistance, friction in the chain and gears, and air drag. The importance of drag rises rapidly with speed, due to the factor of ùë£2 in the drag force, so at high-enough speeds drag is the dominant consumer of energy.

2014-09-02 10:51:35 UTC / rev 78ca0ee9dfae

88

3 Symmetry and conservation

Therefore, let's simplify the analysis by assuming that drag is the only consumer of energy. At the maximum cycling speed, the power consumed by drag equals the maximum power that the rider can supply. The problem therefore divides into two estimates: the power consumed by drag (ùëÉdrag) and the power that an athlete can supply (ùëÉathlete).

Power is force times velocity:

energy

power = time = force√ódistance

time

= force √ó velocity.

(3.69)

Therefore,

ùëÉdrag = ùêπdragùë£max ‚àº ùúåùë£3ùê¥cs.

(3.70)

Setting ùëÉdrag = ùëÉathlete allows us to solve for the maximum speed: 1/3

air ùê¥cs

where ùê¥cs is the cyclist's cross-sectional area. In Section 1.7.2, we estimated ùëÉathlete as 300 watts. To estimate the cross-sectional area, divide it into a width and a height. The width is a body width‚Äîsay, 0.4 meters. A racing cyclist crouches, so the height is roughly 1 meter rather than a full 2 meters.

Then ùê¥cs is roughly 0.4 square meters.

Plugging in the numbers gives

W ‚â° Js,

J ‚â° N m,

N ‚â° s2 .

(3.73)

The three definitions are represented in the next divide-and-conquer tree, one definition at each nonleaf node. Propagating the leaves toward the root gives us the following expression for the watt in terms of meters, kilograms, and seconds (the fundamental units in the SI system): kg m2

In more familiar units, the record speed is 22 miles per hour or 36 kilometers per hour. As a comparison, the world 1-hour record‚Äîcycling as far as possible in 1 hour‚Äîis 49.7 kilometers or 30.9 miles, set in 2005 by Ond≈ôej Sosenka. Our prediction, based on the conservation analysis of drag, is roughly 70 percent of the actual value.

How can such an estimate be considered useful?

High accuracy often requires analyzing and tracking many physical effects.

The calculations and bookkeeping can easily obscure the most important effect and its core idea, costing us insight and understanding. Therefore, almost everywhere in this book, the goal is an estimate within a factor of 2

or 3. That level of agreement is usually enough to convince us that our model contains the situation's essential features.

Here, our predicted speed is only 30 percent lower than the actual value, so our model of the energy cost of cycling must be broadly correct. Its main error arises from the factor of one-half that we ignored when estimating the drag force‚Äîas you can check by doing Problem 3.33.

3.5.4 Fuel efficiency of automobiles

Bicycles, in many places, are overshadowed by cars. From the analysis of drag, we can estimate the fuel consumption of a car (at highway speeds).

Most of the world measures fuel consumption in liters of fuel per 100 kilometers of driving. The United States uses the reciprocal quantity, fuel efficiency‚Äîdistance per volume of fuel‚Äîmeasured in miles per US gallon. To develop unit flexibility, we'll do the calculation using both systems.

For a bicycle, we compared powers: the power consumed by drag with the power supplied by an athlete. For a car, we are interested in the fuel consumption, which is related to the energy contained in the fuel. Therefore, we need to compare energies. For cars traveling at highway speeds, most of the energy is consumed fighting drag. Therefore, the energy consumed by drag equals the energy supplied by the fuel.

Driving a distance ùëë, which will be 100 kilometers, consumes an energy ùê∏drag ‚àº ùúåairùë£2ùê¥cs ùëë.

1. Density ratio ùúå air/ùúå fuel. The density of gasoline is similar to the density of water, so the density ratio is roughly 10‚àí3.

2. Speed ùë£. A highway speed is roughly 100 kilometers per hour (60 miles per hour) or 30 meters per second. (A useful approximation for Americans is that 1 meter per second is roughly 2 miles per hour.) 3. Energy density ‚Ñ∞ fuel. We estimated this quantity Section 2.1 as roughly 10 kilocalories per gram or 40 megajoules per kilogram.

ùê¥consumption

The struck-through exponent of 3 in the m3 indicates that the cubic meters became linear meters, as a result of cancellation with the m2 in the ùê¥consumption. The resulting distance is 50 kilometers or 30 miles. The predicted fuel efficiency is thus roughly 30 miles per gallon.

This prediction is very close to the official values. For example, for new mid-size American cars (in 2013), fuel efficiencies of nonelectric vehicles range from 16 to 43 miles per gallon, with a mean and median of 30 miles per gallon (7.8 liters per 100 kilometers).

The fuel-efficiency and fuel-consumption predictions are far more accurate than we deserve, given the many approximations! For example, we ignored all energy losses except for drag. We also used a very rough drag force ùúåairùë£2ùê¥cs, derived from a reasonable but crude conservation argument. Yet, like Pippi Longstocking, we came out right anyway.

What went right?

3 Symmetry and conservation

The analysis neglects two important factors, so such accuracy is possible only if these factors cancel. The first factor is the dimensionless constant hidden in the single approximation sign of the drag force: ùêπdrag ‚àº ùúåairùê¥csùë£2.

(3.83)

Including the dimensionless prefactor (shown in gray), the drag force is ùêπdrag = 12ùëêd ùúåairùê¥csùë£2,

(3.84)

where ùëêd is the drag coefficient (introduced in Section 3.2.1). The factor of one-half comes from the one-half in the definition of kinetic energy. The drag coefficient is the remaining adjustment, and its origin is the subject of Section 5.3.2. For now, we need to know only that, for a typical car, ùëêd ‚âà 1/2.

Therefore, the dimensionless prefactor hidden in the single approximation sign is approximately 1/4.

Based on this more accurate drag force, will cars use more or less than 8 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers?

Including the ùëêd/2 reduces the drag force and the fuel consumption by a factor of 4. Therefore, cars would travel 120 miles on 1 gallon of fuel or would consume only 2 liters per 100 kilometers. This more careful prediction is far too optimistic‚Äîand far worse than the original, simpler estimate.

What other effect did we neglect?

The engine efficiency‚Äîa typical combustion engine, whether gasoline or human, is only about 25 percent efficient: An engine extracts only one-quarter of the combustion energy in the fuel; the remaining three-quarters turns into heat without doing mechanical work. Including this factor increases our estimate of the fuel consumption by a factor of 4.

The engine efficiency and the more accurate drag force together give the following estimate of the fuel consumption, with the new effect in gray: 1

What is the fuel consumption and efficiency of a bicyclist powered by peanut butter? Express your estimate as an efficiency (miles per gallon of peanut butter) and a consumption (liters of peanut butter per 100 kilometers). How does a bicycle compare with a car?

3.6 Lift using conservation of momentum

If drag is a drag, our next force, which is the companion to drag, should lift our spirits. Using conservation and box models, we will estimate the power required to generate lift. There are two main cases: hovering flight‚Äîfor example, a hummingbird‚Äîand forward flight. Compared to forward flight, hovering flight has one fewer parameter (there is no forward velocity), so let's begin with its analysis, for a bird of mass ùëö.

3.6.1 Hovering: Hummingbirds

How much power does a hummingbird require to hover?

box

Hovering demands power because a hummingbird has weight: The Earth, via the gravitational field, supplies the hummingbird bird

with downward momentum. The Earth therefore loses downward downward

momentum or, equivalently, acquires upward momentum. (Thus, momentum

the Earth accelerates upward toward the hummingbird, although earth

very, very slowly.) This flow of momentum can be tracked with a box model. Let's draw the box around the Earth‚Äìhummingbird system and imagine the system as the whole universe. The box contains a fixed (constant) amount of downward momentum, so the gravitational field can transfer downward momentum only within the box. In particular, the field transfers downward momentum from the Earth to the hummingbird. This picture is a fancy way of saying that the Earth exerts a downward force on the hummingbird, but the fancy way shows us what the hovering hummingbird must do to stay aloft.

box

If the hummingbird keeps this downward momentum, it would accumulate downward speed‚Äîand crash to the ground. Fortunately, the air

box has one more constituent: the fluid (air). The hummingbird gives the downward momentum to the air: It flaps its wings and sends air bird

downward. Lift, like drag, requires a fluid. (The air pushes down on the Earth, returning the downward momentum that the Earth lost via the gravitational field. Thus, the Earth does not accelerate.) earth

How much power is required to send air downward?

Power is force times speed. The force is the gravitational force ùëöùëî that the hummingbird is unloading onto the air. Estimating the air's downward speed ùë£ùëß requires careful thought about the flow of momentum. The air carries the downward momentum supplied to the hummingbird. The momentum supply (a momentum rate or momentum per time) is area ‚àº L2

the force ùëöùëî: Force is simply momentum per time. Because mo-vz

mentum flux is momentum per time per area, ùëöùëî = momentum flux √ó area.

mom. density

When we first studied flux, in Section 3.4.2, we derived that

‚àº œÅ airvz

flux of stuff = density of stuff √ó flow speed.

(3.87)

Because our stuff is momentum, this relation takes the particular form momentum flux = momentum density √ó flow speed.

(3.88)

Substituting this momentum flux into ùëöùëî = momentum flux √ó area, ùëöùëî = momentum density √ó flow speed √ó area.

(3.89)

Momentum density is momentum (ùëöairùë£ùëß) per volume, so it is ùúåairùë£ùëß. The flow speed is ùë£ùëß. Thus,

ùëöùëî = ùúåairùë£ùëß √ó ùë£ùëß √ó area = ùúåairùë£2ùëß √ó area.

(3.90)

To complete this equation, so that it gives us the downward velocity ùë£ùëß, we need to estimate the area. It is the area over which the hummingbird directs air downward. It is roughly ùêø2, where ùêø is the wingspan (wingtip to wingtip). Even though the wings do not fill that entire area, the relevant area is still ùêø2, because the wings disturb air in a region whose size is comparable to their longest dimension. (For this reason, high-efficiency planes, such as gliders, have very long wings.)

Using ùêø2 as the estimate for the area, we get 2014-09-02 10:51:35 UTC / rev 78ca0ee9dfae

With this downward velocity and with the downward force ùëöùëî, the power ùëÉ (not to be confused with momentum!) is

(3.94)

mass ùëö ‚âà 2.5 g.

As the first step in estimating the hovering power, we'll estimate the downward air speed using our formula for ùë£ùëß. The result is that, to stay aloft, the hummingbird sends air downward at roughly 1.3 meters per second: ùëöùëî

7 watts per kilogram (Section 1.7.2). However, for a chemically unenhanced world-class athlete, 5 watts per kilogram is a more typical value. According to our estimates, hummingbird muscles should be twice as powerful as this world-class human value! Even for a small bird, hovering is hard work.

Problem 3.35

Fueling hovering

How much nectar must a hummingbird drink, as a fraction of its body mass, in order to hover for its working day (roughly 8 hours)? By mass, nectar is roughly 50 percent sugar.

Human hovering

How much power would a person have to put out in order to hover by flapping his or her arms?

3.6.2 Lift in forward flight

Now that we understand the fundamental mechanism wing

of lift‚Äîdiscarding downward momentum by giving it to the air‚Äîwe are ready to study forward flight: the body

flight of a migrating bird or of a plane. Forward flight is more complicated than hovering because forward wing

flight has two velocities: the plane's forward velocity ùë£ and the downward component ùë£ùëß of the air's velocity after passing around the wing. In forward flight, ùë£ùëß depends not only on the plane's weight and wingspan, but also on the plane's forward velocity.

To stay aloft, the plane, like the hummingbird, must deflect air downward.

The wing does this magic using complicated fluid mechanics, but we need not investigate it. All the gymnastics are hidden in the box. We need just the downward velocity ùë£ùëß required to keep the plane aloft, and the power required to give the air that much downward velocity. The power is, as with hovering, ùëöùëîùë£ùëß. However, the downward velocity ùë£ùëß is not the same as in hovering.

It is determined by a slightly different momentum-flow diagram. It shows the air flow before and after it meets the wing.

3.6 Lift using conservation of momentum

downward

mom. density

‚àº œÅ airvz

Before the air reaches the wing (the left tube), the air has zero downward momentum. As in the analysis of hovering flight, the Earth supplies downward momentum to the plane, which passes it onto the air. This downward momentum is carried away by the air after the wing (the right tube).

As with any flux, the rate of transfer of downward momentum is flux of downward momentum √ó area.

(3.98)

As in the analysis of the hummingbird, this rate must be ùëöùëî, so that the plane stays aloft. The first factor, the flux of downward momentum, is density of downward momentum √ó flow speed.

(3.99)

Therefore,

ùëöùëî = density of downward momentum √ó flow speed √ó area.

(3.100)

As in the analysis of hovering, the density of downward momentum is ùúåùë£ùëß.

In contrast to the analysis of hovering, where the stuff (downward momentum) is carried by the air moving downward, here the stuff is carried by air moving to the right. Thus, where the flow speed in hovering was the downward air speed ùë£ùëß, in forward flight the flow speed is the forward velocity ùë£.

As in the analysis of hovering, the relevant area is the squared wingspan ùêø2, because the wings alter the airflow over a distance comparable to their longest dimension, which is their wingspan. You can see this effect in a NASA photograph of an airplane flying through a cloud of smoke. The giant swirl, known as the wake vortex, has a diameter comparable to the plane's wingspan. Large planes can generate vortices that flip over small planes. Thus, when coming in for landing, planes must maintain enough separation to give these vortices time to dissipate.

In contrast to hovering, in forward flight the power contains the forward velocity in the denominator‚Äîa location that would produce nonsense for hovering, where the forward velocity is zero.

As we did for hovering flight using the Calliope hummingbird, let's apply our knowledge of forward flight to an actual object. The object will be a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, and we will estimate the power that it requires in order to take off. A 747 has a wingspan ùêø of approximately 60 meters, and a maximum takeoff mass ùëö of approximately 4√ó105 kilograms (400 tons).

We'll estimate the power in two steps: the weight ùëöùëî and then the downward air speed ùë£ùëß. The weight is the easy step: It is just 4 √ó 106 newtons.

The downward air speed ùë£ùëß is ùëöùëî/ùúåairùë£ùêø2. The only unknown quantity is the takeoff speed ùë£. You can estimate it by estimating the plane's acceleration ùëé while taxiing on the runway and by estimating the duration of the 2014-09-02 10:51:35 UTC / rev 78ca0ee9dfae

acceleration. When I last flew on a 747, I measured the acceleration by suspending my key chain from a string and estimating the angle ùúÉ that it made with vertical (perpendicular to the ground). Then tan ùúÉ = ùëé/ùëî. For small ùúÉ, the relation simplifies to ùëé/ùëî ‚âà ùúÉ. I found ùúÉ ‚âà 0.2, so the acceleration was about 0.2ùëî or 2 meters per second per second. This acceleration lasted for about 40 seconds, giving a takeoff speed of ùë£ ‚âà 80 meters per second (180

miles per hour).

The resulting downward speed ùë£ùëß is roughly 12 meters per second: ùëöùëî

(3.105)

Let's see whether these estimates are reasonable. According to the plane's technical documentation, the 747-400's four engines together can provide roughly 1 meganewton of thrust. This thrust can accelerate the plane, with a mass of 4√ó105 kilograms, at 2.5 meters per second. This value is in good agreement with my estimate of 2 meters per second, made by suspending a key chain from a string and turning it into a plumb line.

As another check: At takeoff, when ùë£ is roughly 80 meters per second, the meganewton of thrust corresponds to a power output ùêπùë£ of 80 megawatts.

This output is comparable to our estimate of 50 megawatts for the power to lift the plane off the ground. After liftoff, the engines use some of their power to lift the plane and some to accelerate the plane, because the plane still needs to reach its cruising speed of 250 meters per second.

Symmetry and conservation make even fluid dynamics tractable.

3.7 Summary and further problems

In the midst of change, find what does not change‚Äîthe invariant or conserved quantity. Finding these quantities simplifies problems: We focus on the few quantities that do not change rather than on the many ways in which quantities do change. An instance of this idea with wide application is a box model, where what goes in must come out. By choosing suitable boxes, we could estimate rainfalls and drag forces, and understand lift.
