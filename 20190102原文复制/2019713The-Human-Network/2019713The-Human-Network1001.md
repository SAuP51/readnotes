There is much to be optimistic about. Economic productivity is at a historic high, large parts of the world are emerging from extreme poverty, and wars are down. People are living longer and enjoying themselves more. But there are challenges ahead. Divisions in our networks of interaction and communication remain, and some are even growing despite our advances in the ability to connect at a distance. The resulting frustration with increased immobility and inequality, when combined with growing polarization, can be volatile.

We need to better understand the benefits and risks from ever-increasing financial entanglements and address those risks rather than ignoring them. We need to recognize that our network is highly connected when it comes to the transmission of diseases, including some that we have yet to encounter and that may spread more rapidly and widely than in our worst nightmares. We need to recognize the numerous externalities in our lives, as well as how networks shape our social norms and behaviors, including corruption and crime. We need to combat the damaging side-effects of homophily, as well as improve the incentives to collect and spread accurate and deep information, while learning to better filter the noise. Understanding the human network can ensure that our increased connectivity will improve our collective intelligence and productivity, instead of dividing society even more.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

As we have seen in these pages, people are embedded in many different networks that combine to shape our views and actions. This is never truer than when writing a book. Stress also reveals much about your true friendships, and writing a book shines a bright light on relationships.

The seed for this book came from my wife’s line-by-line proofreading of a text I wrote called Social and Economic Networks . Sara loved the descriptions of the concepts and ideas that came at the beginning of each chapter, before the technical presentation. Compiling those descriptions would have made for a short and dry book, but it made it clear that the many wonders of how networks influence human behavior could be made accessible to a wide readership, and there was at least one person interested in learning more.

A special thanks to Asher Wolinsky, for a lunch conversation in 1992 that sparked my interest in networks, and for his collaboration that launched me on the journey that eventually led to this book. I have a long list of coauthors on social interactions whose deep influences on my views are explicit or implicit in the pages here. In chronological order: Asher Wolinsky, Alison Watts, Bhaskar Dutta, Ehud Kalai, Anna Bogomolnaia, Anne van den Nouweland, Toni Calvó-Armengol, Roland Fryer, Francis Bloch, Gary Charness, Alan Kirman, Jernej Čopič, Brian Rogers, Massimo Morelli, Dunia López Pintado, Leeat Yariv, Andrea Galeotti, Sanjeev Goyal, Fernando Vega-Redondo, Ben Golub, Sergio Currarini, Paolo Pin, Daron Acemoglu, Tomas Rodriguez Barraquer, Xu Tan, Abhijit Banerjee, Arun Chandrasekhar, Esther Duflo, Yiqing Xing, Yves Zenou, Matt Elliott, Stephen Nei, Matt Leduc, Ramesh Johari, Sylvia Morelli, Desmond Ong, Rucha Makati, Jamil Zaki, Pietro Tebaldi, Mohammad Akbarpour, Evan Storms, Nathan Canen, Francesco Trebbi, Zafer Kanik, and Sharon Shiao.

I am grateful to have had much of my research, which provided the background for this book, supported by a number of organizations: Northwestern University, Caltech, Stanford University, the National Science Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, the Army Research Office, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, and the Santa Fe Institute. In addition, I wish to give a shout-out to Wikipedia — it gives one faith in our human network and its ability to harvest our collective knowledge. It is unparalleled in its centrality, quickly connecting one to otherwise hard-to-find sources on almost any subject.

I have drawn on a lot of social capital in the writing of this book. My family — my wife, Sara; my daughters, Lisa and Emilie; my parents, Sally and Hal; and my brother and sister, Mark and Kim — commented on many drafts, kept my morale high, and put up with outlandish hours. My academic「parents,」Hugo Sonnenschein, Salvador Barberà, and Darrell Duffie, have shaped me over the years, and their decades of friendship and mentoring are greatly appreciated. Salvador also provided very helpful comments on a draft, as did several of my academic「children,」Yiqing Xing, Eduardo Laguna Műggenburg, Isa Chaves, Sharon Shiao, and Evan Storms. My literary family — Tim Sullivan, Max Brockman, Erroll McDonald, and Nicholas Thomson — guided me and kept me moving through the long process of writing such a book. Erroll McDonald is a remarkable editor and his surgical cuts and suggestions are deeply appreciated.

## NOTES

1. INTRODUCTION: NETWORKS AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR

2. POWER AND INFLUENCE: CENTRAL POSITIONS IN NETWORKS

3. DIFFUSION AND CONTAGION

1 . A study by Katharine Dean et al. (2010) suggests that the medieval spread of the Black Plague may have been primarily due to fleas and lice that live mostly on humans, and not so dependent upon rats and other animals. The hygiene of the day meant that such fleas and lice were abundant and could easily make their way from one host to another. The rarer modern cases of the plague are more dependent upon flea-bearing animals or close human-to-human contact, given that fewer people now live with lice and fleas regularly upon them so that it is now harder for, say, a flea to make its way directly from one human to another.

2 . See Marvel, Martin, Doering, Lusseau, and Newman (2013).

3 . This figure is based on data from a study by Peter Bearman, James Moody, and Katherine Stovel (2004), involving the Add Health data set (the National Longitudinal Adolescent Health data set, as referenced in Chapter 1). The figure differs slightly from their figure 2.

4 . More precisely, a component is a part of a network in which every node can reach every other node via a path in the network, and is maximal in the sense that every link that involves any node in the component (and hence any neighbor of a node in the component) is included in the component.

5 . Networks tend to have at most one giant component. Having two of them requires having many people in each of the two components. However, for those two components to be separate, it has to be that nobody in either component has any connections to the other component, which becomes very unlikely as the numbers of people in each of the two components increase. It only takes one connection across the two components to combine them into one.

6 . I am glossing over an issue of timing here. Some of the relationships ended before others began, and so there are certain restrictions on which directions a disease might move in this network. That can slow contagion down, but would not necessarily eliminate it from still infecting large numbers of those in the giant component. See Johansen (2004); Wu et al. (2010); Barabási (2011); Pfitzner, Scholtes, Tessone, Garras, and Schweitzer (2013); and Akbarpour and Jackson (2018) for discussion and details.

7 . The estimates of its prevalence vary widely depending on the sample of the population and the techniques used to measure and define infection, and are complicated by the fact that many people have no idea that they are infected. Estimates of the fraction of sexually active people who have been infected at one point in their lives are well above 50 percent (see Revzina and DiClemente [2005] for a meta-study).

8 . For background, see Stanley (1971).

9 . The Big Fifty rifle earned notoriety in a battle in 1874 between roughly thirty buffalo hunters and several hundred Comanche, Cheyenne, and Kiowa warriors at a trading post known as Adobe Walls in the Texas Panhandle. On the third day, one of the hunters, Billy Dixon, in what he acknowledged as a lucky shot, killed an Indian chief at an estimated 1,538 yards, helping to convince the Indians to end the battle.

10 . Althaus (2014).

11 . These sorts of high-level calculations are abstracting from a great amount of heterogeneity in populations — it may be that reproduction numbers within schools are much higher than in the general population. These sorts of broad estimates are made from observing the number of cases over time in large populations, and much more detailed information can be used in designing policies for stemming contagions. However, for our discussion, these high-level numbers provide the essential insights.

12 . The reproduction number of a disease can be greater than one in part of a population or in some locations and not in others, and this can still lead it to reach large portions of the population and cross boundaries. A detailed analysis of this phenomenon appears in Jackson and López Pintado (2013).

13 . Sidgwick found externalities inescapable when trying to devise measures of a society’s well-being. Earlier philosophers, such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, grappled with externalities as they developed ways of measuring a society’s well-being, but failed to articulate them as clearly. Economists such as Adam Smith (1776) and Alfred Marshall (1890) mentioned the issue in their writings on the efficiency of markets, but largely sidestepped externalities, even though Marshall was familiar with Sidgwick and his writings. Marshall seems to have been distrustful of a government’s ability to do much of anything, and so it is perhaps not surprising that he avoided the topic of externalities, since overcoming externalities often involves regulations, taxes, or other government interventions. Arthur Cecil Pigou is the name that many economists associate with externalities, as he mentioned them directly in a 1920 essay. Interestingly, this may be in part responding to a critique by Allyn Young, who in 1913 pointed out that such effects were glossed over in earlier work by Pigou ( Wealth and Welfare , by A. C. Pigou, M.A., London: Macmillan, 1912) and suggested that it deserves a fuller treatment (see Young’s p. 676 — and thanks to Ken Arrow for pointing me to Young’s paper). Yet it would not actually be until the 1960s, with a pair of papers by Ronald Coase and James Buchanan and Craig Stubblebine, that externalities would really be completely laid out in their modern form (Coase [1960]; Buchanan and Stubblebine [1962]). One can also find intermediate works that wrestle with these concepts such as that of Frank Knight (1924) and Tibor Scitovsky (1954). An excellent discussion is given by Kenneth Arrow (1969).

14 . This definition of externalities is a broadly encompassing and modern version. It does not require that the consequences of one’s behaviors on others be intended, and it applies to all sorts of behaviors from a single person smoking to a tire factory polluting. It includes both positive externalities, such as someone coming up with the idea for public-key encryption for Web security, and negative externalities, such as someone cheating in a sports competition. Often externalities are incidental and not the reason for the original behavior: as in the case of a person smoking. But there are cases in which externalities are intended, as for instance when someone writes software and makes it freely available. This makes the definition a bit slippery, since one person punching another is not really what we mean to capture with the concept of externality, but it is admitted under the definition here. I will stick with the definition that may be over-inclusive for the sake of simplicity and to cover the wide variety of ways that externalities appear in networks.

15 . There are many forms of externalities in network settings. They should not be confused with the special class that are termed「network externalities.」 Those refer to situations in which a person’s consumption value of, say, a new technology depends on how many others also use the same technology. Network externalities certainly matter in networks, but there are many other forms of externality that are of interest to us.

19 . It was first studied mathematically by Ray Solomonoff and Anatol Rapoport (1951), and then studied more extensively in the late 1950s and early 1960s by the mathematicians Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi (1959; 1960), when they built the foundations of random graph theory. It is less well known that it was independently studied by Edgar Gilbert (1959).

20 . More detailed numbers appear in a follow-up study by Travers and Milgram (1969).

21 . See Dodds, Muhamad, and Watts (2003).

22 . The answer to this question is important to cover here, but given its extensive treatment elsewhere I will stick to the basic insights. See Watts (1999) for more discussion and illustrations, and Jackson (2008) for mathematical detail.

23 . More generally, beyond Facebook, estimates of the number of people known by a given individual (where known means having some contact in the last two years and reciprocally being able to contact each other) vary but are in the range of upper hundreds to thousands depending on the technique and populations used for estimation. See McCarty, Killworth, Bernard, and Johnsen (2001) and McCormick, Salganik, and Zheng (2010).

24 . This is roughly right when accounting for the friendship paradox, which leads to more friends, and the rate at which Diana’s friends might be friends with each other, which lowers the number of new people reached. For those of you interested in the mathematical details, there are two problems with this quick calculation. This first is that we overestimated the rate at which the neighborhoods expand, since not every friend at every step is「new」: some have already been reached. For instance, some of a user’s friends’ friends are that user’s friends. For instance, if Diana is friends with Emilie and Lisa, then when going out on paths of length 2, if they are friends with each other, then we have already counted them among the 200 friends, and so they should not be counted at the next step. Thus, the 200 new friends at each step for each person generally involves some double counting. However, even if we do a conservative approximation and cut the number of new friends reached at each step after the first in half, to 100, we would end up with 200 × 100 × 100 × 100 = 200 million after four steps. (A better approximation has the number of new friends be higher at early steps and lower at later steps. But it generally has mostly new friends until the very last step, since most of the population is reached at the last step.) By the fifth step we would have reached 720 million users, and this tells us almost exactly why Ugander Karrer, Backstrom, and Marlow (2011) found an average distance between any two active users of 4.7. The other problem with our calculation is to assume that every friend brings in the same number of additional friends on the next step. There is substantial heterogeneity in the population and one friend might reach 500 new friends and another almost none. However, with this large a network and average degree, this variation essentially washes out. This is a fact that traces back to the work of Erdős and Rényi mentioned above (1959; 1960) for networks in which links are formed uniformly at random, and has now been established in much richer random network models (e.g., see Jackson [2008b]). Variations of laws of large numbers apply and working with approximations that ignore individual to individual variations are very accurate in many settings, even in networks as rich and global as Facebook.

27 . As Cesaretti Lobo, Bettencourt, Ortman, Smith (2016) point out, medieval cities involved social and spatial structures that share many features in common with modern cities. The medieval population, however, was much more rural than a modern population, and traveled much less. For more discussion see Ferguson (2018).

37 . There are many other things that might also correlate with degree here, for instance, how large a territory a tuatara has, which might also relate to the animal’s chance of having ticks. One cannot rule out all such alternative explanations without a controlled experiment, but the fact that the mite infections do not exhibit the correlation with degree but are correlated with territory and body size is reassuring.

38 . See Godfrey (2013).

39 . Christakis and Fowler (2010).

40 . Having high degree does not always mean bad news in terms of infection. Japanese macaques (monkeys) with more social contact have been found to have fewer lice than other macaques who had less social contact. This is a seasonal effect, as found in Duboscq, Romano, Sueur, and MacIntosh (2016). A key form of contact between macaques is to groom each other, with one removing lice eggs from the other — a form of true friendship. Thus, contact not only leads to the spread of lice, but also to their removal. Higher degree translates into more grooming by others and ultimately to having fewer lice.

45 . The Super Bowl is usually the most viewed event in the U.S. each year: more than one third of the U.S. population watched its television broadcast in 2016. Although it has some international viewership, it is small in comparison to FIFA’s World Cup Final or the opening of the Olympics (Beijing’s opening holds the record), which can be orders of magnitude higher in viewers. Thus, it is really a U.S.-based game.

4. TOO CONNECTED TO FAIL: FINANCIAL NETWORKS

1 . More than thirty countries are major producers of coffee (producing more than thirty million pounds per year). Global chains such as Starbucks and Costa Coffee ride out a political crisis or weather disaster that causes temporary shortages in one region by sourcing from somewhere else. World commodity prices can still be volatile (and coffee prices are certainly no exception), but a company trying to consistently deliver coffee to consumers is better off if it can buy from many countries than if it is locked into just one region and exposed to the idiosyncratic production gyrations in that one region.

2 . This is just part of Sheila Ramos’s story, as reported by Paul Kiel. The fuller story is fascinatingly told by Kiel in「The Great American Foreclosure Story: The Struggle for Justice and a Place to Call Home,」ProPublica, 2012.

3 . Fannie Mae is the common nickname for FNMA, which is the Federal National Mortgage Association; and Freddie Mac stands for FHLMC — which is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collected loans from all over the U.S. and packaged them into bunches called mortgage-backed securities and more generally collateralized-debt obligations. A third enterprise that was a major player in the mortgage market, Ginnie Mae (for GNMA — the Government National Mortgage Association), was government-run and specialized in loans such as those to veterans or low-income housing and other government programs. It is also large and had its difficulties, but is less central to our story.

4 . Credit default swaps are the primary form of insurance that various financial institutions were buying to make sure they would be paid if a collateralized-debt obligation (e.g., a mortgage-backed security) failed to make its payments. For instance, if someone was buying a mortgage-backed security from Lehman Brothers, they might also go to AIG to buy some insurance against the once seemingly absurd event that Lehman Brothers would fail to pay on its obligation.

5 . For a detailed discussion of this point, see Elliott, Golub, and Jackson (2014).

6 . Beneficial trading can involve short-term borrowing and lending with other banks as their deposits fluctuate, as well as exchanging currencies as a bank’s exposure to specific currencies fluctuates, and even much longer-term co-investing as banks may each have regional expertise that biases their portfolios of loans and other investments to be local. You might ask why one cares whether a bank’s portfolio is unbalanced. Someone who buys shares of different banks could do the diversifying by holding a portfolio of banks even if the banks themselves are not well-diversified in their investments. Indeed, a lack of diversification by the banks themselves would not be a problem without the frictions and costs of potential bankruptcies. However, bankruptcy costs are real losses to the economy: valuable resources remain idle or underutilized while the bankruptcy is sorted out, and enormous amounts of time and legal costs are burned in the process. Those costs are what make us want to avoid any firm becoming insolvent, and also what makes it especially costly to have bankruptcies become contagious.

7 . This does not mean that (c) is a「safe」situation: here each bank still only has between four and six connections, and so there can still be nontrivial exposure and a large-scale default by several banks at the same time could take others with it.

8 . Guilt by association can also accompany this phenomenon. When Lehman Brothers hit bankruptcy, companies that looked like Lehman, not just ones that did business with them, were also suddenly cast into uncertainty. In fact, banks all over the world curtailed the short-term (overnight) lending among themselves, which they normally use to meet capital reserve requirements (amounts of cash that they need to have on hand by regulation) and to do other short-term smoothing. Nobody was sure which banks were safe and which were not. As overnight trading evaporated, those markets had to be propped up by countries’ central banks.

9 . For instance, see Bloom (2009).

10 . For more discussion, see, for instance, Shiller (2015).

11 . Prominent people can end up causing panics by their statements. If someone who is observed by many others says that he or she has lost confidence in some bank or other financial enterprise, even if one does not believe them, one might fear that some of the many others who observe the same prominent person will. For more on the ability of prominent people to correlate the behavior of others, see Acemoglu and Jackson (2014).

12 . Branch (2002).

13 . Of the lost 44 percent, 16 percent are legal costs and other losses associated with the bankruptcy itself, and the other 28 percent are losses in the values of the assets (e.g., investments gone bad) that either triggered the insolvency or came along with trying to unwind and sell off the assets. At least the 16 percent is loss due to bankruptcy, and likely some of the other 28 percent is due to the bankruptcy as well, as a result of a firesale of assets.

14 . See https://www5.fdic.gov/hsob/HSOBRpt.asp .

15 . The arguments for and against the separation hinge on trade-offs of conflicts of interest versus economies of scale and scope. Having companies trying to make money by trading and selling securities, and at the same time managing other people’s money, for instance, could lead them to push people toward securities that the company has interests in, or to gain advantageous information about intended buy and sell orders before other investors. The benefits of economies of scale and scope are discussed below.

16 . For more background and references on core-periphery financial networks, see Wang (2017), Farboodi (2017); Hugonnier, Lester, and Weill (2014); Fricke and Lux (2014); van der Leij, in’t Veld, Daan and Hommes (2016); Gofman (2011); and Babus and Hu (2017).

17 . There are many other issues with having a few banks that are doing most of the business that I will not discuss here, such as the substantial market power in determining prices and extracting profits that comes with a few firms dominating an industry, as well as temptations to take advantage of their ability to cross market-making and trading boundaries.

18 . See Uzzi (1997).

19 . The arrows actually also incorporate indirect exposures, via a measure that we outline in the paper (see Elliott, Golub, and Jackson [2014] for details).

20 . For instance, see the discussion of the Asian Crisis in Baig and Goldfajn (1999). For more background on financial crises and contagions across countries, see Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) as well as Kindelberger (2000); Neal and Weidenmier (2003); and Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2003).

21 . Battiston et al. (2016) note a related challenge in monitoring financial networks: the phase transitions and abrupt cascades that accompany financial markets mean that being slightly off in the measurement of someone’s exposure to some investment, or in the network, can lead to a substantial underestimation of the potential cascade that can ensue.

22 . See Admati and Hellwig (2013); Admati (2016) for further discussions of incentive problems in financial markets.

23 . See Lucas (2013) for some background history.

24 . In addition to the challenge of regulating moving targets, placing any restrictions on what any given financial company can do with its money has other problems too. By restricting investments, one can push the regulated enterprise to less-diversified portfolios. Many European banks are subject to some constraints on what they can invest in, and some ended up holding a large amount of Greek sovereign debt as that was allowed and offering relatively high interest rates. Regulations and restrictions on investments can also correlate investments, as the regulated entities are pushed to invest in the same more limited options, leading to many insolvencies at the same time if those limited options have a negative shock.

25 . The real popping started in 2007 and continued through 2008. It began with mortgage, subprime lending, and construction companies becoming insolvent: American Freedom Mortgage, Mortgage Lenders Network USA, DR Horton, Countrywide Financial, New Century Financial, American Home Mortgage Investment Corp., Ameriquest…it continued with banks and investment banks becoming insolvent: BNP Paribas, Northern Rock, IndyMac, Bear Stearns…and then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are taken over; and quickly more banks and investment banks are sold off or bankrupt: Meryl Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual; and in various installments AIG gets large amounts of government aid. In the fall of 2008, Congress eventually passed the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program under which troubled bank assets are purchased at inflated values, and finally in November the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged another $800 billion to buy more assets, with more than half of that buying bad mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

26 . There are also forces that correlate the investments of various financial institutions, and banks especially. Some are regulated to only be able to hold some types of assets, so they can be constrained in their portfolios (see note 24). Also, they are often in competition with each other — if one’s investments outperform another’s then they can attract more customers and investors. This can lead them to copy each other — by holding similar portfolios banks can stabilize their customer base, as those customers are then more or less indifferent between them. There is also a herd mentality, which can lead them to move toward the same investments (more on this in Chapter 7, but also see Scharfstein and Stein [1990] and Froot, Scharfstein and Stein [1992]).

27 . January 2011, official government edition.

28 . Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale, among others.

29 . Six members of the commission were appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans and, not surprisingly, they disagreed on the role of regulations — or the lack thereof — in the causes of the crisis, along with various details concerning responsibilities for the crisis. Nonetheless, they agreed on the fact that potential contagion was central to the crisis and an important driver of the government’s intervention. For instance, the dissenting report (page 432), in recounting the importance of the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, states:「A bank cannot hold all of its assets in debt issued by General Electric or AT&T, but can hold it all in Fannie or Freddie debt. The same is true for many other investors in the United States and around the world — they assumed that GSE [government-sponsored enterprise: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] debt was perfectly safe and so they weighted it too heavily in their portfolios. Policymakers were convinced that this counterparty risk faced by many financial institutions meant that any write-down of GSE debt would trigger a chain of failures throughout the financial system. In addition, GSE debt was used as collateral in short-term lending markets, and by extension, their failure would have led to a sudden massive contraction of credit beyond what did occur.」

5. HOMOPHILY: HOUSES DIVIDED

1 . Some jatis do not fit cleanly within a caste. For instance, a clan that had historically included both artisans and soldiers straddles two varnas, but it was shoehorned into one caste in the nineteenth century.

2 . India Human Development Survey (IHDS), conducted by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the University of Maryland: http://ihds.info.edu/ .

3 . See Maurizio Mazzocco and Shiv Saini (2012). Getting accurate estimates of household as well as village-wide incomes and consumptions can often be challenging (e.g., see Ravallion and Chaudhuri [1997]), but even with noisy data, full risk sharing on local levels is still generally rejected (e.g., Townsend [1994]; Fafchamps and Lund [2003]; Kinnan and Townsend [2012]; Samphantharak and Townsend [2018]). Atila Ambrus, Markus Mobius, and Adam Szeidl (2014) look deeply into the specific network structures to understand the mechanics of such risk sharing, and offer intuitive explanations. The dense connections within groups, for instance, allow villagers to help each other out to override small idiosyncratic shocks. When large shocks hit, especially hitting a whole group, then they need to rely on relationships with other groups for help. There, the lack of connections across groups becomes inhibiting, since there are few relationships between the groups: not enough social capital exists across caste lines for them to help each other out in dealing with large hits to their incomes. This is not unique to Indian villages, as there is also ample evidence that the poorest in the United States have similar difficulties in dealing with shocks to their incomes (see, for example, Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston [2008]). Xing (2016) explores why such inefficient risk sharing can be quite entrenched.

4 . Hispanics and other categories form a small minority of this school, and in this case they end up more integrated. The level of integration varies with group size, and tiny groups sometimes have no choice but to integrate. See Currarini, Jackson, and Pin (2009, 2010).

5 . The same patterns are seen when looking at recent Facebook friendships among Dutch teenagers. A study led by Bas Hofstra (Hofstra, Corten, van Tubergen, and Ellisond [2016]) finds stronger homophily among core groups of friends than overall, and finds stronger homophily on ethnicity than gender.

6 . Fryer (2007).

7 . The asymmetry in these numbers is due to the fact that the white population is much larger than the black population. The patterns also differ by gender, as black male and white female couples are much more common than the reverse.

8 . See McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook (2001) for overall background of the vast literature. A few more recent references can be found in Jackson, Rogers, and Zenou (2017). For recent studies on the genetic similarities of friends, see Christakis and Fowler (2014) and Domingue, Belsky, Fletcher, Conley, Boardman, Harris (2018).

9 . Verbrugge (1977). She examined 240 different categories (for instance, ten-year groupings of age, various religions, professions, etc.). Then she calculated odds ratios for the closest friendship. For instance, she compared the odds that someone who is Catholic named a best friend who is Catholic to the odds that someone who is not Catholic named a Catholic as a best friend. If the ratio is 1, then there is no homophily: people are naming Catholics as best friends in the same way regardless of whether they are Catholic or not. The odds ratio for Catholic were 6.3 in Detroit and 6.8 in Alt Neustadt — so Catholics were more than 6 times relatively more likely to name Catholics as best friends than non-Catholics were. Out of the 240 categories she examined, she found all odds ratios to be above 1, and 225 of the 240 odds ratios were statistically significant (the 15 insignificant categories were subsamples that were small), and those odds ratios ranged from 2.2 to 81. The extreme of 81 corresponded to an age category: when asked to name a best friend, someone younger than 25 years old was 81 times relatively more likely to name someone younger than 25 than was someone older than 25.

25 . Yiqing Xing, a former student of mine, and I studied whether people’s ability to predict others’ behaviors depends on their country of origin (Jackson and Xing [2014]). We used populations from the U.S. and India. People were randomly matched with a partner, and they had to coordinate on splitting a sum of money — each simultaneously stating whether they wanted an equal or unequal split, and if unequal who should get the greater share. They only got the money if their requests agreed, and so it was essential to be able to predict what the other person was going to ask for. Only 34 percent of the Indian population went for the equal split, while 83 percent of the U.S. population did. Most important, people were much more accurate in predicting the play of their own population and their overall earnings were higher when matched with their own population. Showing my own bias, I had expected to find little difference across countries, as an equal split seemed so focal to me. That was typical: many errors in prediction were from predicting that the other population would act like one’s own. Other researchers have also found significant differences in play across culture populations. A group of economists and anthropologists, headed by Joe Henrich (Henrich et al. [2001]), tested levels of prosocial (altruistic) behavior across a variety of different societies and countries. They found that self-interested play was higher in cultures with less market access, and that access to markets actually led to more prosocial behavior. Their explanation for this is that prosociality and cooperation are needed to make markets work.

26 . The fact that friends act similarly has not been lost on businesses. Kreditech is a company out of Hamburg that offers small loans in parts of Europe. They ask prospective borrowers for access to their social media accounts. If they see that an applicant’s friend has defaulted on a Kreditech loan, then they are more likely to reject the applicant, while if they see that the applicant’s friends are well-employed then they are more likely to offer a loan. (「Lenders Are Turning to Social Media to Assess Borrowers,」 The Economist , February 9, 2013).

27 . Christofer Edling, Jens Rydgren, and Rickard Sandell (2016) examined millions of Spanish register records that tracked migrants’ locations as well as internal movements before and after the bombings. They found a reluctance of native Spaniards to live in immigrant neighborhoods as well as a trend for Arabs to move closer to each other. Edling, Rydgren, and Sandell use a measure of segregation that varies from 0 to 1 depending on how segregated a group is — with 1 representing complete segregation and 0 being total integration. The segregation of the Arab population was near .7 in the year 2000, and had dropped to .58 by the time of the bombing. It quickly reversed and by 2006 it was up to almost .63 again, and would take several years to move back to the pre-bombing trend.

28 . See http://www.prisonexp.org/the-story/ . See also, Haney, Banks, and Zimbardo (1973) for a detailed description of the protocols of the experiment.

29 . This is also described in Haney, Banks, and Zimbardo (1973). A consultant on the experiment, Carlo Prescott, suggested in an editorial ( Stanford Daily , April 28, 2005) that guards were encouraged to act in some of the ways that they did. Regardless, the point for our purposes is that the subjects assumed the identities in a short period of time and the division between the two groups was stark.

30 . Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011).

31 . GDP is in PPP 2000 international dollars (purchasing power parity adjusted dollars). If you wish to work with the data, it is quite illuminating and you can find the file I used to create these figures on my Web site — but credit for the data should go to (and details on precise variable definitions can be found in) Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011).

32 . You may be questioning whether segregation is the real driver of the poor functioning of a country or just a by-product. It could be that poorly functioning countries somehow encourage people to segregate, or remain separated, by ethnicity. There is nothing in the figure that shows any causal relationship. We cannot do a carefully controlled experiment to test such a theory, since we cannot create some segregated countries and some nonsegregated countries, and then put them in identical situations and watch them evolve over time. Despite not being able to do an experiment, Alberto Alesina and Ekaterina Zhuravskaya (2011) provide evidence suggesting that these relationships are causal. They use a technique that is common for dealing with such data, using「instrumental variables.」The ideas behind this technique, and its application here, are explained in an online supplementary appendix to this text that can be found on my Web site, under Chapter 5.

33 . It also helps us navigate a network. You can find more discussion in the online supplementary appendix and also in Chapter 5 in Duncan Watts (2004).

6. IMMOBILITY AND INEQUALITY: NETWORK FEEDBACK AND POVERTY TRAPS

1 . For those of you who do not remember Olympia Beer’s publicity, or who thought Artesia was a place, artesian water refers to water that is under natural pressure, and often sitting in an aquifer that is at an angle and that provides water with little effort.

2 . Claire Vaye Watkins,「The Ivy League Was Another Planet,」 New York Times , March 28, 2013.

3 . See https://www.theodysseyonline.com/black-women-in-tech .

4 . There are many ways of measuring mobility — how children’s education, income, wealth, social class, longevity all depend on those attributes of their parents, and one can measure father-son, mother-daughter, mother-son, etc. The enormous research on such measures finds similar patterns to what we see above — significant correlations and a lot of variation across countries; although there can be some differences in the magnitudes depending on what exactly is being measured. The term「elasticity」is what economists use to refer to things that are all done in percentage terms, in order to compare across situations. The numbers here are calculated by estimating the following sort of equation: ln ( Incomechild ) = α + β ln ( Incomeparent) + error , and so Incomechild = factor × Incomeparent . The numbers are similar for sons and daughters. See Lee and Solon (2009).

5 . This is capturing the correlation in income across generations, rather than wealth. Inheritance of wealth provides a direct channel of correlation of wealth across generations, while the correlation of income stems from many things other than wealth transmission.

6 . See「The American Dream? Social Mobility and Equality in the US & EU,」Dalia Research, March 1, 2017. A detailed study by Alesina, Stantcheva, and Teso (2018) finds similar overoptimism in the U.S. compared to a series of European countries. They also find that the overoptimism is highest in some of the states in which mobility is lowest. Moreover, they find that people’s perceptions of mobility correlate with their political views, perceptions of government, and support for redistribution.

7 . You might notice that the name is a bit off for this graph. Jay Gatsby did in fact manage to become very wealthy, albeit as a bootlegger, and hence was economically quite mobile, despite his background. It was a particular social ladder that he failed to climb. Nonetheless, the name is catchy, and does evoke the immobility in the U.S., which now goes beyond social class to include the economic.

8 . For the correlation in Denmark see the supplementary material of Calvó-Armengol and Jackson (2009), while the U.S. correlation comes from Huang (2013). The attainment numbers are 43 percent for the U.S. and 39 percent for Denmark, from http://www.russell sage.org/research/chartbook/percentage-population-select-countries-bachelors-degrees-or-higher-age (accessed December 6, 2016).

9 . If you want to see more detail, an online appendix on my Web site gives two other ways of thinking of Gini indices, as well as some other measures of inequality.

10 . There are other ways to understand and visualize the Gini index, and the interested reader can find more detail in the online appendix. I learned the method explained here from Sam Bowles, and it is much simpler than the usual explanations, which appear in the appendix.

11 . In many countries getting accurate income information for the full population is challenging. Figure 6.3 involves a series of different studies and depends on local government reporting and so should be interpreted with some caution. Moreover, Gini indices depend on whether one accounts for taxes and welfare programs. If a country has a high tax rate on high incomes and then offers large subsidies to the poor, then whether one looks at pre-tax or post-tax incomes can make a difference. In some European countries looking at post-tax rather than pre-tax incomes lowers the Gini significantly. The Gini index for the United States drops by about 10 percentage points when including taxes and transfers. Moreover, by reducing a complex phenomenon to one number, the Gini index does not give us a full picture of whether inequality is due only to the lower class being extremely poor or whether the middle class is also relatively poor. Nonetheless, these numbers do give us a rough idea of how unequally income is distributed.

15 . Although inequality has been increasing within many countries throughout the world, it has been decreasing between countries, as key developing countries are getting wealthier overall even as inequality grows within them. See the online appendix for more background.

16 . See Goldin and Katz (2009) for an insightful overview of the evolution of education and productivity through the twentieth century.

17 . Acemoglu et al. (2016) have a direct estimate of 10 percent, but then accounting for further equilibrium effects (from lost business in other parts of the economy that spill over) doubles the estimate. Similarly, Hicks and Devaraj (2015) estimate that 87 percent of the decrease in manufacturing jobs has been from changes in technology and only 13 percent from production leaving the U.S.

18 . Parts of information technology are lumped into the service sector, but people have suggested expanding the number of sectors that track the production of the economy to accommodate the richer range of modern economic activities.

The top one percent includes millions of people in a variety of different jobs.

23 . In particular, for families who are in the bottom fifth of the income distribution, less than 30 percent of their children end up with college degrees. In contrast, families in the top fifth of the income distribution have more than 80 percent of their children end up with college degrees. Chetty and Hendren (2015).

29 . Differences are not just in speaking to young children. Flavio Cunha analyzed how many hours mothers spend with their children doing a variety of things:「soothing the baby when he/she is upset; moving the baby’s arms and legs around playfully; talking to the baby; playing peek-a-boo with the baby; singing songs with the baby; telling stories to the baby; reading books to the baby; and taking the baby outside to play in the yard, park, or playground.」Mothers spend, typically, somewhere around four or five hours per day interacting with their young children in these ways. This varies, however, with the mothers’ background. Mothers who have at least a two-year college degree spend more than two thirds of an hour a day more than do mothers who were high school dropouts with their young children. See Cunha (2016).

37 . Claire Vaye Watkins,「The Ivy League Was Another Planet.」

38 . See Jackson (2017) for more background on definitions of social capital.

39 . We are skipping some forms of capital. For instance,「somatic capital」refers to the health and strength of one’s body, which depends on calories, exercise, genetics, access to health care, and so forth. This is important in some settings, for instance, in a society of hunter-gatherers, but is less vital in our discussion. We are also skipping「cultural capital」(Bourdieu and Passeron [1970]), which becomes slippery to define, as culture is itself a rich concept with many interpretations. Our discussion will not require making cultural capital explicit, although it will be implicit.

40 . Social capital has been defined in many ways, and appears sporadically over the last century. See, for instance, the many definitions in Dasgupta and Serageldin (2001) and Sobel (2002), and the discussion in Jackson (2017). Two of the first to define social capital explicitly in terms similar to the way we use it here were Pierre Bourdieu and Glenn Loury. Pierre Bourdieu defined it as (Bourdieu, 1986)「the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance or recognition.」Glenn Loury states (Loury, 1977),「It may thus be useful to employ a concept of ‘social capital’ to represent the consequences of social position in facilitating acquisition of the standard human capital characteristics.」Our definition goes beyond Loury’s in allowing social capital to be used for more than acquiring human capital — for instance, calling on a friend for a loan. For details on alternative sources and measures of social capital, see Jackson (2017).

41 . In terms of our discussion of centrality measures, concepts like eigenvector and diffusion centrality can capture aspects of social capital that will be missed by degree centrality.

42 . 2104 American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau.

43 . Bischoff and Reardon (2014). Let us call a family「poor」if its income is less than two thirds of the median family income, a family ‘「rich」if its income is more than three halves of the median family income. Define a neighborhood as poor if the majority of families in the neighborhood are poor, and call a neighborhood rich if the majority of families are rich. In 1970, 7 percent of families lived in poor neighborhoods, 8 percent in rich neighborhoods, and the remainder in mixed neighborhoods. In fact, 65 percent lived in neighborhoods in which the median income was between 80 and 125 percent of the U.S. median income. By 2009, 15 percent of families lived in poor neighborhoods, 18 percent lived in rich neighborhoods, and only 42 percent lived in neighborhoods in which the median income was between 80 and 125 percent of the U.S. median income. For more detailed ways of measuring geographic segregation, see Echenique and Fryer Jr. (2007).

44 . Earlier studies that looked at short-term outcomes were mixed in terms of finding significant impact beyond mental health. For instance, see Clampet-Lundquist and Massey (2008); Ludwig et al. (2008); de Souza Briggs, Popkin, and Goering (2010); Fryer Jr. and Katz (2013). The longer-term effects are now measurable and provide clear evidence of the impact of the program, as shown by Chetty and Hendren (2015); Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016b).

45 . There can be some selection effects in these numbers, since families choose whether to move, and some did not move. One has to take into consideration effects such as having families who care more about their children be the most likely to make use of the vouchers and move. To avoid such issues, Raj Chetty and Nathan Hendren (Chetty and Hendren, 2015) compare siblings whose families moved (so there were two children of different ages whose family moved to see how different their outcomes are), among other things to check that the effects are causal and appropriately estimated.

46 . This includes Pierre Bourdieu, James Coleman, Glenn Loury, Douglas Massey, Elinor Ostrom, Robert Putnam, and William Julius Wilson, among many others. The literature is too immense to summarize succinctly, but for a range of classic references from different fields and perspectives see Bourdieu and Passeron (1970); Loury (1977); Coleman and Hoffer (1987); Ostrom (1990); Massey and Denton (1993); Putnam (2000); Wilson (2012).

He negotiated a key accord with China when tensions over U.S. relations with Taiwan were high, and was instrumental in convincing President Reagan to have extended talks with Mikhail Gorbachev, setting the stage for a thaw and ultimately an end to the Cold War. But before George Shultz was a politician, he was an economist at MIT and the University of Chicago in the 1950s through the early 1970s.

57 . The logic of getting more bids/opportunities leading to a better price is an old one in economics, driving the analysis of auctions, for instance. Its role in explaining wage differences by race is explored by Arrow and Borzekowski (2004) (see also Smith [2000]). It also, for instance, plays a role in why the disabled get worse prices for car repairs than nondisabled, as they seek fewer quotes (it is more time-consuming for them to access multiple shops to get quotes) and this is also anticipated by the repair shops who give them higher quotes, as analyzed by Gneezy, List, and Price (2012).

58 . See Calvó-Armengol and Jackson (2004, 2007). There are some interesting subtleties in these settings. Friends help provide information about jobs, but they also compete for jobs, and so much of the technical detail that Toni Calvó-Armengol and I wrestled with was in sorting those effects out. This effect is present in the data. As Lori Beaman finds (Beaman, 2012), if refugees are relocated into a community of many others from their same country, then this increases their employment if those refugees have been there for a while, as they provide job information, while it hurts their employment if those others are arriving at the same time, as they compete for jobs. For more details on the fraction of co-ethnics in an area and employment, see Munshi (2003); Patacchini and Zenou (2012).

59 . One theory (among several) on the term「doughboys」traces the term back to the Mexican-American War of 1846–1848. The infantry, in marching over dusty trails, accumulated dust and looked much like the adobe houses of northern Mexico. The alliteration of「adobe」became「doughboy.」See http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/origindb.htm .

62 . Granovetter (1973, 1995).

63 . Bramoullé and Rogers (2010) also find less homophily for more popular students: if a student is named just once as a friend then there is a 75 percent chance it is by someone of the same gender, but if they are named by ten students then there is just a 51 percent chance of them being of the same gender. This would be consistent with the fewer friendships being stronger ties, on average, for instance.

They found no evidence that the referred employees worked any harder because they cared about the referrer’s reputation. But other studies in which employers can actively penalize the referrer if the referred does not work out, as in a Bangladeshi garment factory (see Heath [forthcoming]), find that the referred does seem to react to reputational concerns. Also, Beaman and Magruder (2012) find that if pay is based on the referred’s performance, then better people are referred.

77 . To address the small portion of jobs that are being exported from developed countries, one could work at a policy that would be truly beneficial on a world scale: enforcing world work standards. Costs of labor around the world vary substantially, especially for unskilled labor — at times reaching ratios of twenty or more. Part of this has to do with varying standards and lack of enforcement of work safety, hours, minimum wages, benefits, and general working conditions. Putting a priority on enforcing global minimal labor standards would help slow some of the trends, and likely in a much more productive manner than imposing trade barriers.

80 . The costs of such a policy of a base income are not unthinkable. For the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (conservatively estimated at about $2.4 trillion), one could give each person in the lowest 20 percent of the income distribution in the U.S. $5,000 per year for the next eight years. For a family of four, that would be $20,000 in cash, tax free each year. If one accounts for the savings of other programs that this would offset, the net cost could be much lower. It is radical, but not infeasible.

Group versus individual performance is the bread and butter of social psychology and there are many examples in which groups outperform individuals, including situations in which they outperform their best members at a task, and it can depend on how the team is organized.

DeGroot rediscovered the model and began to analyze it in more detail. An independent rediscovery often suggests a good idea.

13 . For details on how this is calculated see Jackson (2008).

14 . For those who want a bit more mathematical background. Two conditions are needed in the DeGroot model in order to guarantee a consensus. One is that information from any one person can flow to any other via some directed path in the network. The second is a condition known as aperiodicity: that the least common divisor of all (directed) cycles in the network is one. See Golub and Jackson (2010).

15 . This presumes the eigenvector centralities have been normalized to sum to one; if not, just divide by the total sum of the eigenvector centralities.

16 . Such double counting also goes by the name of「correlation neglect」and has important implications in voting and other behaviors. For instance, see Demarzo, Vayanos, and Zweibel (2003); Glaeser and Sunstein (2009); Levy and Razin (2015).

21 . To fully account for whether a network is well-balanced, we need to adjust for how much each person interacts with others and how much they weight those other opinions when they update their own opinions. The full description is in Golub and Jackson (2010). The speed with which beliefs converge will also depend on the network structure and those weights (Golub and Jackson [2012]).

22 . For more about such advantages and disadvantages to different network structures, and opinion leaders, see Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955); Jackson and Wolinsky (1996); Bala and Goyal (1998); Golub and Jackson (2010, 2012); Galeotti and Goyal (2010); Molavi, TahbazSalehi, and Jadbabaie (2018).

29 . This abstracts away from personal tastes, which can lead to more diverse views on products like wine, restaurants, and movies. Still, despite individual variation in evaluations of some products, there can still be a sort of common base assessment that can be communicated, and the large industry of rating such goods suggests that hearing other people’s opinions is valuable.

30 . There are many issues with reviews. For instance, many product review systems have heavily skewed distributions of ratings — with most giving excellent scores and occasional poor scores, but few scores in the middle. Somebody who loves or hates a product may be motivated to write a review, while people who feel lukewarm are less motivated to spend time entering a review. The few reviewers who spend lots of time writing many reviews might also have biases, including being paid to like products. See Duan, Gu, and Whinston (2008); Fradkin, Grewal, Holtz, and Pearson (2015); Tadelis (2016); and Nei (2017).

44 . Beyond timing issues, the production of news is undergoing a fundamental shift in how revenues are generated. The Internet poses a number of challenges for news services. Revenue from classified advertising has plummeted as has circulation of print versions of news. Revenue from online advertising, and online subscriptions, has not replaced disappearing streams of traditional revenues. For backgrounds, see for instance, Waldman (2011); Hamilton (2016); the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017 ( http://po.st/lfJFXh ); Pew Research Center「Newspaper industry estimated advertising and circulation revenue」(June 1, 2017, http://www.journalism.org/chart/newspaper-industry-estimated-advertising-and-circulation-revenue/ ).

57 . The code was developed by Renzo Lucioni, and modified by Peter Aldhous, with some adjustments for my analysis.

58 . The choice of a threshold for what fraction of bills two senators had to vote the same on in order to be linked, and the year examined matters (e.g., see the Blog by Randy Olson of December 21, 2013, at http://www.randalolson.com/blog/ ). A threshold of one half is one where senators who are linked then agree more than they disagree. I used data as recent as possible at the time of the analysis for this chapter (2015), and back to the comparable date of 1990 from the partisanship data discussed earlier. You can find the code and data and details behind the construction of the figures on my Web site if you wish to explore the relationships in more detail.

61 . See Jackson (2008b) and Section VII in Golub and Jackson (2012).

62 . This presumes that the network is not completely fragmented, and that no part of the network is substantially denser than some other part. For instance, if everyone in marketing is in contact with dozens of other employees, while people in production interact only with one or two others, then this could fail, but simply because different parts of the network have different diffusion properties, not because of the homophily.

It is difficult to test directly for such informational effects just using stock data, even though there is suggestive evidence as discussed by Bikhchandani and Sharma (2000) and Hirshleifer and Hong Teoh (2003). However, when you put people in a lab setting, so you control the information and can see what people buy and sell, then there is clear herding behavior, as seen in Anderson and Holt (1997) and Hung and Plott (2001).

13 . This is another quote of dubious origin. It is not clear that Confucius ever said it, although it is widely attributed to him. It is more likely a morphing of a quote from Analects , a text that was likely written centuries later by followers, and has a fascinating history of its own.

14 . The logic of herding comes from a pair of studies by Abhijit Banerjee (1992) and Sushil Bikhchandani, David Hirshleifer, and Ivo Welch (1992).

19 . It seems that fish suppliers take advantage of our inability to judge. In a study of sushi restaurants in Los Angeles (a town with a good reputation for sushi), a team of researchers (Willette et al. [2017]) gathered 364 fish samples from twenty-six restaurants, in a variety of neighborhoods, price ranges, and ratings levels, over a four-year period. Using analysis of the DNA of the fish samples, they checked whether the fish that they were served matched what it was sold as. Every single restaurant sold them at least one piece of sushi that was not as advertised. Overall, 47 percent of the sushi was mislabeled! Some species were almost always mislabeled — usually ones for which there are look-alike substitutes. For instance, 89 percent of red snapper and 93 percent of what was sold as yellowtail were something else, while only 8 percent of the mackerel was mislabeled. One cannot just blame the restaurants, as they are part of a chain of suppliers, but it is clear that somewhere along the line someone is taking repeated advantage of our inability to discern types of fish.

20 . See Young (1996) for more discussion of conventions. The driving example is an interesting one, since some countries have dramatically changed sides. The divisions that remain are often separated by bodies of water or major mountain ranges, with little traffic between countries.

21 . Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman (2003); Martinelli, Parker, Pérez-Gea, and Rodrigo (2015); Su and Wu (2016).

22 . Fisman and Miguel (2007).

23 . Kuwait, with corruption of -1.1, is dropped from the figure because it is so far out of the picture (250 parking tickets per diplomat) that it squeezes the rest of the picture. It is a true outlier, not only in the huge number of tickets it had, but also in having a lower than average corruption level. (The corruption number for Kuwait in the Fisman and Miguel data seems to be out of line with many other indices that have its corruption as being close to the levels of India, Brazil, Bulgaria, and other countries with significant corruption.) I still include Kuwait in all of the numbers quoted, and, even with Kuwait included, there is a significant correlation between a country’s corruption and how many tickets its diplomats amass. For instance, the comparison of 23 and 12 includes Kuwait among noncorrupt. Dropping Kuwait from that calculation would lead to an even starker contrast, as then the average tickets among noncorrupt countries drops to 8!

24 . This is also related to the concept of「transitivity」: if A knows B and B knows C, does A know C?

25 . Chandrasekhar and Jackson (2016).

26 . See Watts (1999) for some examples, and you can find a range of clustering coefficients in data sets described in Jackson and Rogers (2007a).

27 . Chandrasekhar and Jackson (2016).

28 . Jackson and Rogers (2007a).

29 . There are also cases in which diffusion of a new product can happen without such reinforcement. For example, we found no social reinforcement effects in the diffusion of microfinance in our Indian village study (Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, and Jackson, 2013). There it seems that microfinance was something that villagers were already somewhat familiar with and able to decide about on their own, but that information about the availability of microfinance was something that they needed to know about. Simple awareness acts more like a disease in its spread and so does not depend on clustering or other local reinforcement to spread.

30 . Goel et al. (2016).

31 . See Beaman, BenYishay, Magruder, and Mobarak (2015). Damon Centola (2011) tested how diffusion worked in a setting in which people might care to have multiple friends act in order to act themselves, among an online community of more than fifteen hundred people from a health interest site. He connected some of the participants to each other in a highly clustered network and the rest of the participants were connected to each other in a network with low clustering. Each of the participants thus got some new「health buddies」and they could learn things about what their buddies were doing. He then seeded one of the people with a chance to join a health forum. Each time someone joined, his or her health buddies would get a message telling them that the buddy had joined. So if multiple buddies of someone joined the forum then they would get multiple messages. Damon found rates of diffusion of the forum that were 42 percent higher in clustered networks than in the random networks. This seemed to be a case in which multiple stimuli were important in getting people to act, and even though the clustered network had greater average distances between people, the diffusion spread faster and to more people than in the less clustered network.

32 . The concept of「Nash equilibrium」is what was referred to when I mentioned multiple equilibria in settings with coordination issues. John Nash proved that such equilibria exist in a wide class of settings. It has become a primary tool in modern economics.

33 . This definition of support and the game theory behind it are developed in Jackson, Rodriguez Barraquer, and Tan (2012). You might be wondering how having friends in common relates to clustering. Both involve triangles in networks and so there is a close relationship. If lots of relationships are supported, then there will be lots of triangles and so the network will tend to be highly clustered. But support and clustering are distinct conceptually. For instance, in the Indian villages, more than 90 percent of relationships are supported; however, the clustering tends to be only between 20 and 30 percent. When we think about a supported relationship, it is a relationship — a link in the network — that is what is supported by the friend in common. Clustering asks what fraction of a person’s friends are friends with each other. Support and clustering also can play quite distinct roles in enforcing behavior. Support plays a role via a witness, guarantor, or enforcer, as the third party to a relationship, while clustering ensures that people can coordinate their behaviors in influencing someone else. See Coleman (1988) for more on this latter point.

34 . There are times at which nuclear families require more calories than they produce. For instance, see Hill and Hurtado (2017).

35 . See Kaplan, Hill, Lancaster, and Hurtado (2000) and Hill (2002), for example.

36 . For an overarching perspective on human cooperation see Seabright (2010).

37 . See Jackson, Rodriguez Barraquer, and Tan (2012); Feinberg, Willer, and Schultz (2014); and Ali and Miller (2016). Coleman (1988) examines a different aspect of such communication as he discusses how clustering can help two friends of a given person coordinate in sanctioning a given person, which is different from what is discussed here. See Jackson, Rodriguez Barraquer, and Tan (2012) for more discussion of the distinction.

38 . Jackson, Rodriguez Barraquer, and Tan (2012).

39 . The precise percentages quoted here come from the second wave of our data (that we collected in Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, and Jackson [2016]). The rates of support were similar whether we looked at the borrowing of money, kerosene, or rice, or the offering of help or advice. Interestingly, support was significantly lower when we looked at more purely social interactions, such as having someone come to visit, which have no associated incentive issues. Also, the 93 percent support figure may be an underestimate, as when collecting network information by surveys one can miss some links — especially as not all people participate in the surveys.

4 . See Friedman (2016) for a wider discussion; and Hjort and Poulsen (2018) for an example of how the Internet affects productivity and employment.

5 . The subject of network formation has been analyzed extensively. For our purposes here, I just focus on a couple of important insights, but there are many more in the literature. More technical and detailed discussion and numerous references can be found in Jackson (2008) and Jackson, Rogers, and Zenou (2017).

6 . Jackson and Wolinsky (1996).

7 . There are nuances here that I am ignoring to get across a basic insight. The way in which externalities and incentives to form relationships interact can be complex in some situations and has resulted in many studies of how networks form. You can find much more technical discussions of the literature in Jackson (2003, 2008a, 2014).

8 . There is a third fairly important force that I discuss in the online appendix available on my Web site. Network formation also involves feedback. The more friends a person has, the easier it is for them to meet more people, and the more attractive they are as a friend to others given the increased externalities that they offer. This feedback can lead to inequality in network formation: people with more friends gain even more friends.

9 . As we saw in Chapter 7, for things like the formation of people’s opinions, it can be the relative numbers of connections that people have with others rather than the absolute numbers that are consequential (details on this appear in Golub and Jackson [2012]). If new relationships are added that are more homophilistic, then the network becomes more homophilistic and opinions can remain or become more polarized, even as the network becomes denser.

10 . The fact that there has been a significant decrease is robust to when the cutoff is made, as noted in Jackson and Nei (2015): from 1820 to 1959 it was .00056, while from 1960 to 2000 it was .00005, from 1820 to 1969 it was .00053, and from 1970 to 2000 it was .00005. In terms of wars per country (instead of per pair of countries): from 1820 to 1959 the rate was .012, while from 1960 to 2000 it was .004. Based on all「Militarized Interstate Disputes」(MID2s-MID5s) instead of just wars (MID5s — involving at least 1,000 deaths): from 1820 to 1959 there are .006 MIDs per pair of countries, while from 1960 to 2000 there were .003. Nonetheless, whether the change in conflict is statistically significant depends on what class of random processes one presumes generates the conflict. There are some processes for which it will take much more data to be sure, as pointed out by Clauset (2017).

11 . Data are from 1870–1949: Klasing and Milionis (2014); 1950–1959 Penn World Trade Tables Version 8.1; 1960–2015 World Bank World Development Indicators.

12 . In fact, ignoring the Second World War, the number of alliances was only 1.7 per country from 1816 to 1940.

18 . See the discussion in Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy (2016); Boxell, Shapiro, and Shapiro (2017); Fiorina (2017); and Gentzkow (2017). There is still quite a bit of disagreement (polarization?) among researchers as to how to measure polarization, the extent to which it is increasing, and what the causes could be.

19 . See the discussion in Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy (2016).

20 . This is known as the「false consensus effect」in psychology (e.g., see Ross, Greene, and House [1977]), and can be exacerbated by homophily as people’s friends often influence their estimation of what others believe.

21 . I thank Jasmin Droege’s blog「Urbanization vs GDP per Capita Revisited,」April 11, 2016, for pointing me to the data.

22 . E.g., see Barnhardt, Field, and Pande (2016).

23 . Ultimately, technology may also enable people to work remotely, a sort of countervailing force. But as people are increasingly dependent on others for the provision of the goods and services that they consume, there is likely to still be some agglomeration, whether it be suburban, urban, or sprawling metropolitan areas.

24 . Some work and live in cities without proper permission. The「hukou」system of registering families to certain locations in China has kept the surge toward cities from becoming overwhelming, making it a challenge for some to migrate to cities.
