Here’s an even more zoomed-in view of two stretches of shoreline taken at the same latitude, east versus west. You can see that the eastern shore has many long barrier islands, with lagoons and waterways just west of the beaches (figure 8.2).

Do you see what I see? There are lots and lots of low-lying islands on the East Coast than on the west. (Note that I didn’t try to cherry-pick really good locations; these samples are from the same latitude on the West and East Coasts, and are pretty representative of the topography.)

Finally, here’s a real close-up of two locations, west versus east. Now the difference is really clear (figure 8.3).

Of course, there are long stretches of sandy beach in the west (think of the classic beaches of Los Angeles County), and stretches of stony beach in the east (think of the coast of Maine). But when you look at the long view (which is what that map made clear to me), you see different kinds of spaces. It’s literally a different view.

Figure 8.2

Two different stretches of the west and east coastlines. Note how the west doesn’t have many barrier islands, while they’re common in the east.

See that? The West Coast beaches are often stony and highly contoured. East Coast beaches are often broad sweeps of sand.

And now for the real question.

Research Question 1: Why?

Or to be more precise (because framing your research question carefully is half the battle of doing research):

Research Question 2: Why is the East Coast topography dominated by low-lying fringe islands, while the West Coast of the United States is mostly without islands?

To be sure, there are a few islands off the West Coast, but they’re pretty jaggy and stony, while the East Coast islands are mostly sandy and flat. They are, in a word,「fringy,」long and stringy in appearance, apparently mostly made of sand.

I started this research by trying to pick up a few terms that would be useful in my searching. I opened Google Maps and zoomed in for a while, looking at much of the East Coast to get a sense of what it’s like. (This is something you can do easily with a zoomable user interface. It’s simple to look at a whole continent, and pan up and down, while zooming in and out to get both a local and global view of the landforms.) I was looking for a typical section of the coast, and settled on a place on the coast of Maryland and Virginia.

Figure 8.4

I chose Assateague Island as a representative land feature. Not only was it on a long and fairly consistent stretch of the East Coast, but I recognized the name from books I’d read long ago. And visually it seems like a representative stretch of the eastern shore. Since I knew there were a lot of books about Assateague and Chincoteague, I started with a query that would focus the results on what I wanted to learn about—that is, the geography:

[Assateague geography]

I quickly learned that these long, linear islands are called「barrier islands,」and they’re formed by sand being deposited along the shore by currents and storms that create a constantly changing arrangement of sand dunes, sandbars, and sand islands, and waterways between them all.

Figure 8.5

There are barrier islands on the West Coast, but there aren’t many. On the left is Morro Bay in central California, and on the right is Guerrero Negro in Baja California.

So now that I know what these long filaments of sand are called, I can reframe my question to ask a more carefully crafted version of my goal.

Research Question 3: Why are there so many barrier islands on the East Coast, and so few on the West Coast?

With online maps such as Google Maps that let you easily zoom in and out as well as roam up and down the coast, you can check for barrier islands just by zooming out and then dragging your view around. When you do this along the West Coast of North America, you’ll find that there are a couple of barrier islands; there’s one in Morro Bay in central California and another down south in Baja California in Guerrero Negro, but that’s about it. If you look at the islands off the West Coast, they’re all rocky points that seem like mountaintops rather than sandy bars.

The big surprise here is that out of all those roughly three thousand miles (or forty-eight hundred kilometers) of coastline, from Alaska to the tip of Baja California, you can scan the entire coastline using Google Maps and find just a few. By contrast, most of the East Coast is lined with barrier islands.

In my reading of these results, it became clear that the biggest difference is that the shorelines are different between the east and west. If you look at figure 8.1, you can see that the flat areas next to the coast are much wider on the East Coast (up to ten times wider) than the equivalent flat areas just offshore on the West Coast. Why? It turns out that the West Coast is the leading edge of the North American plate, while the East Coast is the trailing edge. Barrier islands form on the trailing edge because there’s a broad, flat place for sand to accumulate.

The Pacific and North American plates meet on the West Coast at the subduction zone—that is, where one plate is sliding under the other. Any sediments that are carried to the ocean move across the narrow continental shelf (off California, this is about twenty miles wide) and fall into this area. There is no sediment buildup and consequently no barrier islands.

On the trailing edge (the East Coast), sediments carried to the ocean have a broad plain to accumulate on. New land is formed at the mid-ocean ridge as the plate moves and a wide continental shelf is created. The continental shelf off the coast of Georgia is around eighty miles wide, or four times larger than off California. And so barrier islands have space, a shallow continental shelf, and sand supply to form.1

So in the final analysis, here’s the short answer to my original question, Why? Because plate tectonics (specifically, the nearby edge of the Pacific plate) force the western coast to be steep without much chance to accumulate the sediments needed to make barrier and fringing islands. By contrast, the East Coast has a long, gently sloping grade from the coastline to the next plate edge (which is far away), giving sediment an easy place to accumulate.

See the following map (from the Wikipedia article on plate tectonics; figure 8.6).2

Note that the Pacific plate butts up against California, while the North American plate extends way out into the Atlantic. That’s a huge difference, and vastly changes the nature of the coastlines as well.

Research Lessons

The real lesson here is obvious.

1. Look up stuff that’s interesting, unknown, or unclear. Learn to recognize the terms and concepts that you might not already know. In searching and reading web pages to answer this question, I had to constantly look up words that were「terms of art.」What actually IS a barrier island? What are「plate tectonics,」and what is the difference between topography and geography? (You could just look them up—and you should.)

2. You need to follow the search deeply enough to get a「real」answer. Many researchers who work on this question found that the East Coast clearly accumulated sediment, but couldn’t say why. Intriguingly, they said they could make up (that is, rationalize) a story quickly. But they didn’t have any data to back up what they were saying. Word to the wise: when you don’t have data, you usually know it. That’s when you slip over the slippery slope into fake storytelling. It’s easy to do, and we all practice it all the time. As researchers, though, we need to be aware of when this happens, and be able to stop ourselves and realize that this is the time for more research.

3. Starting this search was hard; don’t get discouraged at the start. It was difficult getting started with searches that worked. In this case, unless you’re a practicing geologist, terms like「continental shelf」and「shoreline sedimentary systems」don’t just come trippingly off the tongue. Don’t worry about the terminology when beginning a research quest; eventually you’ll learn the relevant language.

4. Follow the people chain. I did find several articles that helped me in my search. By starting with [west coast vs east coast barrier islands] I found an article comparing the two coasts by Molly Samuels (an environmental reporter).3 Reading the comments left by readers on that article led me to Brian Romans, a geologist who writes about island formation for his blog, ClasticDetritus.4 It was his comment that led me to start thinking about plate tectonics.

The point of this is that following the comments in a blog is often a great way to find experts. (But be sure to check their bona fides.) There are lots of random people commenting authoritatively on blog streams as well. If you can’t prove that they actually know something about a topic (usually because of a history of good writing on that topic), then quickly file under「don’t know」and move on to people whose comments you can trust.

5. Use context terms to limit the diversity of your search results. When I was doing my searches, I found that adding the context term geology reduced the number of off-topic results and ended up focusing more on scholarly articles.

6. Sometimes search requires … well, searching. Once upon a time, the verb「search」meant to spend the time looking for something. In this case, I had to hunt around a bit looking for a way to phrase my query to get something useful. Sometimes you get lucky and your first query gets you into a set of results that resolves the question. This kind of question is more complicated. For something like this topic, it might take a few probes to find a valuable set of results. Get in, check out the results, and if you don’t see what you like, move on. But learn as you go; notice the terms used along with the publications and people involved. Usually that is enough to point you in the direction you need to go.

What started this whole thing was the wonderful map made by Raven Maps. I have no affiliation with Raven Maps other than being a fan. Here’s the link to the map that sparked the question.5 You have to see the map in person to get the full effect—but when you look at it, you’ll immediately see that the right-hand side is VERY different than the left-hand side. The East Coast is full of detailed inlets, bays, and islands. The West Coast is relatively straighter, with fewer small details. Hence my original question.

Try This Yourself

This chapter began with an observation about something I noticed on a wall map, and ended with a long series of searches to learn about the differences between the East and West Coasts. Somehow, this ended up with a discussion of plate tectonics and sedimentation rates.

Noticing something and then figuring out WHY that something is that way often leads to fascinating research. Maps are particularly good at letting you see features of the landscape at different scales, and as we know, looking differently at the data frequently leads to insights.

For example, the other day I noticed that there’s apparently a gentle arc of large lakes stretching across North America. You can see it in the following diagram (figure 8.8).

When you see such an apparently unusual alignment of lakes, you might think to yourself, How can I find out why this is so? (While keeping in mind that it could be simply random.)

Figure 8.8

How would you frame a research question for this? And now, knowing about how to ask good research questions, where would you start in answering such a profound one? (Here’s a big hint: doing research starting with an observation might lead to deep questions about large-scale geographic features. Don’t be afraid to follow your research clues to wherever they lead.)

9 Mysterious Mission Stars: How to Read Snippets in the Search Results and Pay Attention to Search Details

Every Spanish mission seems to have an unusual, beautiful, star-shaped window. Is this really a design feature of Spanish architecture from the colonial era? How can we find out?

I was recently in the seaside village of Carmel, California, visiting the old Spanish mission there. It really is a beautiful place; the courtyard is full of flowers, gentle sea breezes flow in from Monterey Bay, and thousands of hummingbirds zip from place to place. It’s a traditional Spanish colonial mission building, with all the architectural stylings that you’d expect—domes, archways, and a distinctive four-lobed-star window. I’ve seen enough of these stars to wonder about them. Where did they come from?

To figure out the story lurking behind the star window at the main entrance to the old Spanish mission in Carmel, a picture is a helpful start.

I was wondering about that prominent star-shaped window over the arched doorway. It’s pretty clearly a colonial era Spanish design element, but I’m not sure I’ve seen it at any other missions in California.

This prompted a few questions for me.

Research Question 1: What is the story with that unusual star over the doorway at Mission Carmel?

Research Question 2: Does any other Californian mission have a star window like that?

Research Question 3: Where did that particular star shape come from? Can you find any other examples of stars in this shape in architecture elsewhere in the world?

Figure 9.1

Above the door at the Carmel mission is a window of a distinctive design. This star pattern appears throughout colonial Spanish architecture. What’s the story behind it?

I started with the first search I could think of:

[star window Carmel mission California]

The results I found were pretty interesting.

The first thing that you learn is the actual name of the mission: Mission San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo.

Everyone just calls it「The Carmel Mission」or「Carmel,」although just the single「Carmel」can also refer to the nearby small town that’s famous for expensive real estate, expensive art shops, and the expensive people living there.

But note the two texts that I’ve circled on the SERP. The first tells me that there’s a「Moorish」architectural element here (which I hadn’t thought about before), and the second ellipse tell me that「the replica has a Mudejar or star window.」That’s a word I haven’t seen before.

Figure 9.2

Just by looking at the search results page (SERP), you can learn a lot, but don’t stop there!

I read both those pages, and sure enough, I see that this entire mission was designed by Manuel Ruíz, a master mason from Mexico City who apparently also designed the Royal Chapel in Monterey (which is nearby, but is NOT the same as the village of Carmel). Ruíz is said to have incorporated Moorish elements into the plan, such as the domes, and the Moorish window, often called the「star window,」over the entrance.

But as the second reference suggests, this kind of window is also called a Mudejar.

I do a quick search for:

[mudejar]

It teaches us that「Mudéjar also denotes a style of Iberian architecture and decoration, particularly of Aragon and Castile strongly influenced by Moorish taste and workmanship.」1 The Mudejares were Muslims who lived in Spain after the 1200s.

Figure 9.3

Mudejar stars appear all over Spain in artwork and even along the Autovía.

I then do an image search for:

[「mudejar star」]

It shows lots of versions of the star in different locations in Spain (including two signs along the Autovía Mudéjar).

As that fourth result in the SERP above suggests, Mudejar stars also decorate other missions, such as the one in San Rafael, prompting another search for:

[San Rafael mudejar star]

In figure 9.4, Google Images shows us the star in the San Rafael Arcángel mission (which is about a hundred miles north of Carmel).

San Rafael Arcángel (1817) is one of the last and most northern of the Spanish missions to be established. It is unique among all the California missions in the fact that it was primarily established as a sanitarium to help heal the native population. (It was set up as a healthy place to go because Mission San Francisco de Assisi, in the current city of San Francisco, was so foggy and damp. This surprises absolutely nobody who has visited San Francisco in the past two hundred years.)

Oddly, when you do a search for San Rafael Arcángel in Google Maps, you see something different. Where’s the white building with the Mudejar star? When you search for Mission San Rafael Arcángel, you land here—and while that mission building has a star window over the door, that’s not quite what we’re looking in this case!

Figure 9.4

Where is it? Ah, with just a little poking around in Google StreetviewA, I found the「mission building」(it’s the white building behind the palm tree in the above image). (See figures 9.5 and 9.6.)

THAT’s where the San Rafael Mudejar star is!

But I know that the California missions all had a complicated history. So I search for:

[Mission San Rafael history]

That leads me to a number of sites that agree: the original San Rafael adobe church was built in 1818, but not long afterward began to disintegrate. San Rafael Arcángel was one of the first missions to be secularized, and in 1833, it was turned over to the Mexican government. By 1844, the mission had been completely abandoned. And somewhere between 1861 to 1870, the ruins of the mission were completely torn down and replaced by a new parish church.

Today, all traces of the early buildings have been lost and all that is left of the original mission is a single pear tree from the old mission’s orchard. For this reason, San Rafael Arcángel is known as the「most obliterated of California’s missions.」2

Luckily for us, on December 18, 1949, a replica of the original mission church with a simple doorway under a star window was dedicated. (I tried to find where this particular design came from, but I haven’t yet succeeded. Is the「replica」really a replica? Or is it just kind of like the original?)

From MissionTour.org we learn that in 1878, General Mariano Vallejo (the governor of California at the time) approved a drawing of the mission done by Edward Vischer (a German-born artist who made a living drawing missions and the Californian scenery). MissionTour.org says that it found this drawing in the collection of the Historic American Buildings Survey run by the Library of Congress. Here is a poorly digitized 1940 photo of that drawing (figure 9.7).

That’s an interesting lead. So I visited the Historic American Buildings Survey site and did the search for [Mission San Rafael]. The Vischer drawing is from this Library of Congress collection. Notice the shape of the window at the end of the building over the door; it’s fairly square.

Yet THIS painting by Renaud (a contemporary of Vischer) dates from before 1835, but how far before is unknown. Here it’s Mudejar star-shaped!

Figure 9.8

And to complicate things, here’s another by Oriana Day (figure 9.9), who painted all the missions between 1861 and 1865.

If I had to guess, I’d say that Day was taking a few liberties. Note that the other two paintings clearly show a walkway with many posts supporting the roof, while the Day portrait does not.

In any case, there’s a Mudejar star in the「replica」building in San Rafael now.

To find other examples of the Mudejar star is fairly straightforward. As we saw in the earlier illustrations from Spain, they’re easy to find with Mudejar as an additional term in the query. But naturally, I wanted more. (Or perhaps, I wanted Moor proof.)

So I queried:

[Moorish architecture Mudejar star]

That search gave me a LOT of examples of stellate images from the Alhambra, that quintessentially Moorish palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain.

But as I entered the query

[Alhambra mudejar …],

Figure 9.9

I started to see some interesting auto-completion suggestions. The second suggestion told me something useful: arte is a Spanish word. (See figure 9.10.) Maybe I should try searching in Spanish. This is, after all, an inherently Spanish term, and there’s probably a lot that I’m missing by searching in English.

The simplest way to search in SpanishB is just to translate the query into Spanish, and then enter it into the search box and see what comes out. If I translate「star」into Spanish, it’s estrella. That query comes up with the following.

In this case, a query with estrella gives us even more fantastic examples of Mudejar stars/estrellas (figure 9.11).

Although I have to admit that my favorite example, which I found just by browsing through the images, was this beautiful fountain in the Alhambra (figure 9.12).

This fountain pretty neatly connects the「star window」in the San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo Mission in Northern California with the Moorish designs of the Alhambra from the heart of Spain.
