Naturally, long-form texts (such as books and longer magazine or journal articles) are great at providing context; that’s often why they’re long. But in other kinds of research where the hits tend to be shorter and decontextualized, the job of finding context is left up to you, the researcher.

4. It’s also easy to find fake, spurious, or incorrect information as well. Technology has made it easy to publish content on the web. That’s great; the world now has more published information than ever, on a wider variety of topics than ever. Just as it’s simple for serious archivists, publishers, and librarians to add to the world’s knowledge, however, it’s also simple for those who are uncaring, or downright uninformed or malicious, to add content that will show up in your online searches. (One of my favorite bizarre stories along this line is the former NASA engineer who claims massive alien motherships are lurking inside the rings of Saturn, spawning UFOs that are plaguing the solar system.) You can find gems of content that are filled with insight and brilliance with your searching, but you can also find bullshit just as easily. It’s all online and it’s all searchable, but this means that you, the researcher, need to understand the author’s motivations as well. You need to follow (at least a little bit) the big trends in publishing. Are false and misleading news articles popular this year? You need to know that, and what signs you should know in order to pick up the fake news.

5. Nothing lasts forever, even online resources. Although people commonly believe that「nothing on the internet is ever deleted,」the truth is that researchers run into missing content all the time. When clicking on a link gives you a「404」error, that means that the target page of the link was moved or deleted. This happens more frequently than you might like. As a great researcher, you need to know how to be resilient in the face of vanishing content. When it happens (and it will happen to you), you’ll need to search again for the missing content. You can often do this by searching by the page title (use the page title of the missing page with the intitle: search operator) or the URL of the old page (use the inurl: operator), or by double quoting key text that was in the document.

A skilled online researcher needs to know not just that a kind of content exists but also where it might be cached after the hosting website has vanished into the ether. You can use cached: as a Google search operator to retrieve the previous version of a web page (for up to six months after it’s gone missing). And when things really go missing, you can often use Internet Archive to find missing content.11

In the future, this means that you’ll continue to need these skills. Although they might well change in form over the next decade, the core ideas—how to narrow a search, how to find repositories of content, how to triangulate information from multiple sources, and how to recover lost or deleted content—will always be core skills.

These five truths suggest that online researchers need to know MORE about the information landscape, not less.

A caution about checklists: every so often you’ll find teaching aids that say「in order to verify/validate information, do this,」with a list of things to check off. The problem is, this「list of things to check」goes out of date quickly. A fundamental property of the online world is that things change constantly—the moment you put up a content quality checklist guide with rules like「check for the presence of a copyright date,」sketchy online publishers figure it out and suddenly, copyright dates are everywhere, making the checklist less useful.

What Will the Future of Online Research Look Like?

As much as I’d like to lay out a clear road map for the future of online content along with search systems to help with that, that’s a bit treacherous. Surely our ability to search will improve as algorithms and tools get better, but exactly how and in what ways it will change are tricky questions. That’s my cautionary note; now let’s look at some trends that seem inevitable over the next few years.

Mobile searching: The global trend toward more searches happening on phones is inexorable. The trade-off for searchers doing detailed research tasks is that the mobile devices have small screens. That makes it a bit more difficult to read large documents with lots of text. It’s also harder to do lateral searching, using multiple tabs or multiple windows to explore comprehensively, or to save the state of your searches. On the other hand, you’ve got an amazing resource with you all the time. And because you’re searching in a specific location, this gives you the opportunity to do local searches (for instance, queries like [coffee near me] works really well when you’re on your mobile device).

Spoken search: Along with more searches on mobile devices comes an increasing trend to speaking your queries aloud. This is true in countries with high levels of literacy, but it is a special boon in countries with lower levels of reading and writing. Voice recognition for queries that works with text to speech is a godsend in such places. But even in high-literacy countries, spoken searches will continue to become an increasing part of our research culture.

Of course, spoken output isn’t the only way to go with mobile devices. The results of search are often best seen and not heard. And while I don’t expect a list of link results to disappear, the results of searches will become more media savvy and give visual resources when that’s a better approach.

Figure 20.3

You can now search your personal photo collection for photos with different kinds of objects (in this case, a beach) within them. Note that none of these photos have the word「beach」attached to them; the AI system recognizes them as beaches.

More artificial-intelligence-based help: Artificially intelligent (AI) systems will change many of our expectations about how online search operates. You can already see this in your personal photos on Google. Searching your personal photos for something like [beach] produces a set of photos of beaches; the AI boost here is that none of these photos have the word「beach」in them—the AI system is attaching labels of things in the photo, letting me later search across my photos.

Right now this works well for things like「cat,」「dog,」「beach,」「ship,」and so on. But you can see that soon we’ll be able to search for pictures with queries like [two golden retrievers playing with babies] and it will just work.

AI also powers entity recognition, which is the ability to identify all the variations on a named entity (e.g.,「Dan Russell,」「Daniel M. Russell,」「Dr. Russell from Google,」and「that guy from Google who works on search named Dan, or something …」), which will improve the ability to search for entity names, even if you don’t know all the variations on that theme. Entity detection will also allow you to ask fairly general questions that depend on a particular kind of entity being listed in the target document. Imagine a query such as [California <technology-company> green energy] where the phrase in angle brackets defines a kind of entity that you want in your results—in this case, any technology company that is in California and working on green energy.

Question answering: Of course, one of the biggest targets of AI is the ability to process natural language well enough to answer questions and potentially have a bit of conversation about your research topic. As it is now, Google and Bing can both handle fairly straightforward queries written in question form. Questions such as [How many countries are in North America?] and [Who was the prime minister of the United Kingdom in 1980?] can be handled easily. You can see the answers starting to improve as both Google and Bing now provide a bit of context in the answers. In Google’s answer to [What is the population of India?], you see the direct answer, but also a chart comparing its population with other similar countries and a panel on the right side with related statistics. (See figure 20.4.)

In essence, questions like this are translated into regular queries and handled in the normal way. But you can see where this is going with improved natural language. Search engines are starting to be able to answer follow-up questions that correctly handle pronouns. You can ask Google, [How tall is President Obama?], and then follow up that question with [How tall is his wife?] and then [How old are their children?]. While this is relatively straightforward, the direction is clear: search interactions can become much more like a conversation. Simple queries will always be with us, but the ability to ask questions and then follow up in the conversation will make much research far simpler.

More social: Social media is a big player in online content, if only for the powerful effect that recommendations have on people. When you’re doing online research, your social network (and implicitly, all the social media systems and tools) can be an incredibly valuable ally in your research. The players may change over time (anyone remember the MySpace social media site?), yet it’s worth cultivating your personal network of friends in the know to ask them for help. In my studies of really extraordinarily skilled researchers, one striking thing I noticed was that they all had (and used) deep and broad Rolodexes, or what would today be called「social contact lists.」

Figure 20.4

Search engines can handle queries that are written out as questions. The ability to do this will continue to improve. The answer shown here provides some nice context information, such as the population graph that compares India’s population with that of the United States and China—a comparison that makes the number of Indians easier to understand.

More assistance: A huge trend in the industry is toward more and more online assistance that goes well beyond research. Mostly, this is a trend toward helping you get everyday tasks done quickly and accurately, but you can see a day when online assistance systems improve your ability to manage multiple research tasks or data sets. One can also safely predict more intelligent agents to provide information-finding aids. Imagine a chatbot reference librarian who knows about the catalog of every library in the world and every reference book out there in their collections.

Content continues to grow in quantity and kind: There’s every reason to believe that content will continue to grow, both in the amount of online content and the different kinds of content. A perpetual challenge as new kinds of resources become available will be how well they can be indexed. Although it doesn’t make much sense to create a new kind of online content that can’t be found by search engines or online catalogs, it happens every day, leaving unhappy researchers to manually track down the content without the aid of an online index. One side effect is that media literacy will be an ever-evolving concept. How media is used will continue to change, and as new kinds of media evolve, so too will the way that they’re used.

Content continues to splinter: It’s not much of a prediction to point out the obvious, which is that copyrights will continue to operate, and new content providers will arise. The side effect of these two forces is that searchable content will continue to be in unsearchable silos. The good news here is that there are also shifts toward increasingly open access publication. But as the publishing industry continues to search for an effective funding model, we, the researchers, should expect information to still be in repositories, some of which are open, and some of which are not. Some will require payment to read their content, and others will be free and open to the public.

Then there’s regulation—the big unknown in the content space, but a highly contested area as publishers look for protection (and payment), while searchers look for answers to research questions. The only thing that’s predictable here is that more regulation will happen, making things increasingly complicated.12

I worry about the future of online research, but my deep belief is that the ecosystem of online content and search over that content is just too useful, too handy, and too important to suddenly go away. The one thing I am certain of is that the landscape of content will change constantly. Sites, data sets, maps, images, recordings, and videos—the whole lot of it—will come and go. Sometimes that change will be driven by deep-seated, honest desires to improve knowledge in the world, sometimes the change will be driven by people who are trying to manipulate information for personal gain, and sometimes the change will happen by accident, when a company (and the information associated with it) goes bankrupt or is absorbed into another company that doesn’t see the value in having the information publicly available.

In other words, the information universe will change shape and content, just as it always has. The big difference is that now there are larger amounts of information and change happens far more quickly.

Likewise, the tools that we use to access, manipulate, and search for that information will continue to change as well. As we’ve seen, kinds of content will come online, and old kinds will disappear. There will be wholly new ways to see information and interact with it. Probably some of those new kinds of content and new tools will vanish as well, like tears in rain.13

But the underlying skills, attitudes, and behaviors you have learned here will continue to be valuable. Knowing how to evaluate the quality of content, and understanding how to go from one resource to another—these are powerful and eternally useful skills. In fact, if anything, these search and research skills will become more valuable, not less so, as things change. The range and diversity of online resources will continue to expand—as will the need to understand them, and discern their quality and accuracy.

I started this book with the idea that you too could learn how to ask (and answer) your odd and peculiarly interesting questions. You’ve seen how I do it, but this is just the beginning; there’s so much more to learn.

Go forth, and start asking—and answering—your own curious questions.

3. For readers on the younger side, an encyclopedia was a huge set of books with many, many articles on different topics, written by experts, arranged in alphabetic order by the subject that they covered. You had to learn the skill of looking for multiple articles if you wanted to get a complete, well-rounded understanding of a topic like「England.」It would be handy if you also read other articles like「United Kingdom」or「Queen Elizabeth.」The better encyclopedias had little hints—links really—to other articles in the encyclopedia. But you had to actually pull out the other volumes (and we’re talking about big books) to read them all. Now, of course, you’d just click on the link to go read the other articles instantly. You can’t believe how much faster clicking is rather than pulling out all the volumes. Remember, you have to put them all back into the bookcase … in alphabetic order!

1. Yes, I know you can edit the articles, changing their content, but in practice, this is harder than you might think. Have you actually tried to edit an article? It takes a special kind of person to work within the Wikipedia system. There’s a fair bit of evidence that the overall quality of Wikipedia articles is quite high. You can see a comprehensive analysis of many studies in the article「The Sum of All Human Knowledge,」in which Wikipedia is shown to favorably compare with the long-established Encyclopedia Britannica. Mustafa Mesgari et al.,「A Systematic Review of Scholarly Research on the Content of Wikipedia,」Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 66, no. 2 (2015): 219–245. bit.LY/TJOS-7-1; http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/103083646/WikiLit_Content_open_access_version.pdf. Alternatively, you can read Wikipedia’s own assessment of its accuracy in the article「Reliability of Wikipedia」(bit.LY/TJOS-7-2; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia). It’s nicely self-referential, but also a decent analysis of what works and what doesn’t. There are many such studies, all of which tell us that the quality of Wikipedia articles is remarkably high.
