Is that plant safe to eat? How would you find out in a hurry?

Many parents have had this awful moment: your kid comes in from playing outside, and their mouth has little green leaves, petals, or white sap from something she’s been eating. The thing you need to figure out—quickly!—is whether it’s poisonous or not.

Here’s my story about trying to quickly identify a local flower.

This time of year, a particular kind of small, white flower blooms all over the valley where I live in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. You see it everywhere—in open fields, along roadsides, anyplace where there’s not a lot of water yet a lot of relatively untended land.

Imagine yourself the parent of a child who comes in carrying this flower, with one-half eaten hanging from her mouth. What’s worse, it smells terrible.

What should you do?

The research question here is fairly simple and obvious.

Research Question 1: What is this plant?

Research Question 2: Is it poisonous or not?

As you can probably tell, I enjoy flowers—especially the local wildflowers that appear everywhere in the valley and woodlands near my home.

So when I saw this particular flower in my daughter’s hand, I recognized it instantly as a member of the Compositae family. That’s the family name for flowers that look like this: they all have multiple flowers in a single disk (botanically「composite」), usually with petals pointing straight out from the center. This family includes sunflowers, dandelions, asters, and similar flowers.

You might not recognize this as a member of the Compositae family, so maybe you’d like to call Poison Control first. The quick way to find out what number to call is with the query:

[poison control]

That gives you the phone number of the emergency service that can help you out. (This is a handy trick to know. It works no matter where you are.)

Poison Control, however, might not know what your local plants are, so while you’re on hold, you could look up this information.

But (this is a key point) many Compositae flowers and plants are edible—both the leaves, stems, and flowers. Some common edible composite flowering plants are Lactuca sativa (lettuce), Cichorium (chicory), Cynara scolymus (globe artichoke), Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Carthamus tinctorius (safflower), and Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke).

So knowing that it’s a Compositae, I did a quick search to see if these flowers are, in general, bad for your health with the query:

[poisonous compositae]

That gives me the following search results page (the SERP in figure 5.2).

Figure 5.3

Reading this SERP tells me a couple of things right off the bat. First, looking at the bolded term Asteraceae in the first result tells me that my word Compositae is probably an outmoded or, at the very least, slightly alternative name. (What can I say? I learned my botany in a different era.)

The link to the Food and Drug Administration’s Poisonous Plant Database is worrisome, but clicking on the link takes me to a slightly scary list of noxious plants.1 Fortunately, scanning that page lets me know that its list of Asteraceae/Compositae plants is all about contact allergies. That is, the plants are not poisonous but are instead just irritating.

Yet as the third question in the「People Also Ask」suggests, chrysanthemums ARE toxic to cats (and dogs)

So there are a few Compositae that are somewhat poisonous in large amounts. The most common is probably burdock, Arctium genus, leaves, which can cause a rash. But even then, burdock roots are good to eat, so it’s not really toxic per se—just really irritating. In the United Kingdom, ragwort, Senecio jacobaea, is poisonous, but we’re not near the United Kingdom; we’re in California.

A little background: the name Asteraceae comes from Aster, the most prominent genus in the family, and derives from the Greek word meaning star. The flower has a clear star shape. Compositae refers to the fact that the family is one of the few flowering plants that have a bunch of tiny flowers growing tightly side by side in a center.

So at this point, I’m not especially worried. Our challenge isn’t to feel good about our background knowledge, though, but rather to identify what the kid is holding in her hand. We want to figure out exactly what it is. If your kid got into a patch of flowers like this one and started munching, should you be worried?

In my case, I’d just turn to one of my plant identification guides such as A Field Guide to Pacific States Wildflowers.2 These books all have a「key」—that is, a linked set of questions about the flower that lead to an identification.

The questions in the key are like this. They’re short, use a fair bit of technical language, and lead you to a plant family or species name. Here’s the last question you have to answer before making a positive identification of a flower as a Compositae:

87a. Flowers in racemes, spikes, or solitary. …

87b. Numerous flowers in heads, sunflower-like. Each flower tubular (some with outer ray flowers). Compositae.

If the flower isn’t in racemes, spikes, or solitary, it’s either a Caprifoliaceae (and pink) or Campanulaceae (and blue). In essence, if you answer each question correctly and then follow the numbers, you’ll end up at the right flower identification. It’s basically a flowchart for identifying flowers.

But it’s a little tricky. In practice, I end up looking up every other word (what’s a「raceme」? What’s an「outer ray flower」?), and going up and down the tree of questions until I finally get to one that matches all the test questions.

We don’t have time for that here. So what can we online searchers do to help?

There are a couple of ways to do this.

A. Find an online wildflower identification book.

Typically, these cost some money. As you can imagine, there aren’t a lot of free ones available online. There are online versions of various field guides that you can buy (say, on iBooks, Amazon, or Google Play Books). You could then just use them to ID the flower in the normal way by working your way up and down the key questions. This is a great use case for tablets or large phones with a reasonably sized display. If it’s an e-book, you can carry lots of field guides with you; this is especially handy as they tend to be big and bulky. The e-versions have links and bookmarks to help you flip back and forth.

B. Search for online wildflower guides specific to the area.

This is the approach I took. Knowing that there are a LOT of people (besides me) who want to identify flowers, I did a simple search:

[wildflowers San Francisco Bay Area]

This query brings up a number of resources that seem like they might work. Notice that I added「San Francisco Bay Area」in the query. Even though Google would probably assume I meant local flowers, I wanted to be sure that I wasn’t also looking at flowers from the far north or far south of California.

After looking through a number of wildflower collections, I finally find two photographers’ collection of white flowers, with a flower that looks similar to the one in the photo above. In their website collection, John Raithel and Linda Herbert label it as Hayfield tarweed (Hemizonia congesta), and in their photo, it looks a LOT like the flower above (figure 5.4).

Getting to this point took a little time, as I had to look through a few collections of white wildflowers before I found this image. As nice as it is, this little picture isn’t quite large enough for me to be sure that the identification of my daughter’s flower is quite right. So I did another search for the Latin name given on the web page, Hemizonia congesta. The obvious search query at this point is to find out more about the biological name.

Credit: Neal Kramer © 2007, The Calflora Database [a nonprofit organization], http://www.calflora.org

As you can see in figure 5.5, the top three results are from the Calflora.org website. I know that Calflora.org is a massive, high-quality database of flowers and plants in California that was originally started by people in the US Forest Service, and who also work with the botanists at the University of California at Berkeley. (You can learn this by checking the「history」tab on the Calflora site, or you could search just for information about the organization by doing a search for [Calflora] and reading about its mission.) Bottom line: for matters botanical, especially in California, I tend to believe Calflora; it’s maintained by botanists, and they’re careful with their content.

I start to get worried, though, when I check the Calflora site. When I look at the page for Hemizonia congesta, nearly all the flowers are yellow. Uh oh. They look like the same flower, but they’re not white. Is this NOT the right flower?

See those links to Hemizonia congesta ssp? Clicking on those shows many photos of this flower from different「ssp」(that is,「subspecies」; you can find this out by searching for [define ssp botany] to learn what that specialty term means). It turns out that there are lots of subspecies, with color variation between yellow and white as part of the defining characteristic. And it turns out that Hemizonia congesta congesta (yes, with the word congesta repeated twice) is the white version of the plant.

Figure 5.7

Whew! So it IS Hemizonia congesta, and most likely the subspecies known as congesta, which is white, not lutescens, which is yellow.

After a little digging around in the intricacies of the naming of this little flower, you’ll find a quiet controversy about whether or not the various subspecies of tarweed should have different names, what that name should be, and how people agree to give it a particular scientific name. This doesn’t matter much to me now, but as we saw at the beginning with the Compositae versus Asteraeae difference, even scientists sometimes change their minds about what to call things.3

Now we have the answer to the first question.

1.	What is this plant?

Answer: Hemizonia congesta, the「Hayfield tarweed」in a white subspecies variation.

Lets now return to the second research question.

2.	Is it poisonous or not?

To find out, I did two quick searches for:

[tarweed edibility]

and

[tarweed poisonous]

The answers come back quickly. Not only is it NOT poisonous; the local Indians would eat the seeds, aggressively harvesting them in the fall to make pinole (a form of meal or watery gruel, made from ground-up acorns, seeds, and wild grain). Reading a bit more, I discovered that they also would burn over the fields to ensure good growing conditions for next year. You wouldn’t go to all this trouble if the plant were really poisonous!

This makes me think, How was tarweed used in early California? As we’ve seen, it’s clear that tarweed was sought out and harvested for food. So I did two searches to follow up on this.

[tarweed Indians]

[tarweed harvesting]

Why is that query [tarweed Indians]? (As opposed to the more politically correct terms「Native Americans」or「indigenous people」?)

Short answer: because that’s where the content is. It’s useful to sometimes use older terms when searching. (It’s fairly easy to compare [tarweed Indians] and [tarweed Native Americans], say, and quickly discover that「Indians」is a much more common term and gives us much better results!

But in both cases, I was able to find many references to the harvesting and preparation of the seeds for food.

One of the loveliest references I could find is a link to this image of a Pomo woman kitted out to collect tarweed. (Although from the title, she’s apparently ready to collect the seeds of the Madia elegans flowers, also called tarweed, which look, taste, and smell much like Hemizonia. They’re all called tarweed, which is a nice example of why the Latin botanical name is much more specific and useful for searching.)

The woman pictured is well-known basket maker Joseppa Pinto Dick (born circa 1860 and died 1905), who was Yokayo Pomo, a native community southeast of Ukiah in Northern California. Here she is ready to collect the plentiful seeds of the Madia elegans flower, a near relative of our Hayfield tarweed, Hemizonia congesta congesta.

Not only is the common tarweed not poisonous; but it’s edible and considered quite good by those who grew up with it. I tried a couple of seeds, and found it hard to get past their resinous flavor. They were a bit too turpentine tasting for me. But perhaps people who like retsina (the pine-flavored Greek wine) would like tarweed as well.

So if you pick one or even walk through a field of them, you’ll be wearing that smell on your hands and clothes until you can scrub it clear. It’s an intense smell—one that reminds you happily of late summer in the golden fields of California or a stink that you can’t wait to get away from. It’s the cilantro of summery scents—appealing to some, and despised by others. One writer described the tarweed aroma as「pungent, soapy, with an intriguing undertone of kerosene.」4 She was right.

Research Lessons

1. When you have a specific name for something, use it. In this case, we found the scientific, binomial, Latin name to uniquely identify our mystery flower.

2. Likewise, when you’ve found a specialized database (such as Calflora) that’s dedicated to a single topic (such as the flowers of California), use it; it probably has great high-quality data.

3. Names change—even within the scientific community. From the start we learned that there are two names for this family of flowers. The name Asteraceae comes from the genus Aster, from the Greek word meaning star, referring to the starlike shape of the flowers. Meanwhile, Compositae is an older name that refers to the fact that flowers in this family are composites, like a daisy, dandelion, or sunflower. (Pay attention, and look at chapter 11 about changing terminology.)

4. Sometimes an online search means manually searching through collections. When searching for the white flower based on the picture, I really knew fairly little about the flower other than how it looked. So there just wasn’t much to go on, and I had to look one picture at a time through a number of collected photo albums. Sure, it felt a little like looking for a criminal in a lineup, but it didn’t take long to spot the suspect in the online photo books.

5. A「key」is a specialized kind of flowchart for identifying flowers (or animals, fossils, kinds of pollen, or microorganisms). When you really want to learn how to identify flowers, you will at some point have to learn how to use a flower key, which leads you through a sequence of questions about the flower in question. In the process, you’ll learn a lot about botany in order to understand the questions. (「Flowers in racemes, spikes, or solitary?」)

Try This Yourself

A useful tactic when searching for specific information is to use specific terms. This might seem obvious (after all, a search engine uses the information you give it), but one of the most common search mistakes that I see people making is to use fairly generic language, hoping that Google will guess what they mean. The remarkable thing is how often this actually works.

Yet if you can use a specific term for your search, it will increase your accuracy.

For example, you might be able to search for a pain in your leg by doing a query for:

[pain in leg]

But then you’d spend some time reading through all the hits trying to determine which of them describes the pain you feel in that part of your leg. Instead, if you can use the right word for the pain in the muscle that’s just to the side of your shin bone, your searching would be much more precise, and you’d get to the best answer more quickly.

Now I’m curious. What’s the name of that muscle that’s just to the outside of your shin bone? Can you figure out what kind of exercise might cause injury to that particular muscle?

6 What’s the Most Likely Way You’ll Die? How to Be Explicit about What You’re Searching to Find (and Why That Matters)

Looking up data sources is fairly easy, but understanding how much you should trust that data is a bit trickier.

I don’t mean to be macabre, especially after the previous chapter, but there are times when your thoughts turn to the eternal. The life of a soldier in the War of 1812 could end in a fairly dramatic way. What about we ordinary people? How do we live, and how do we die?

I was running through yet another cemetery, this time in Middletown, Connecticut, and reading the headstones made me wonder about what causes people die from each year. To make it personal, when I read the headstones in this cemetery, I started to wonder, what are the top reasons people die in the United States these days? We’re not in the middle of the Civil War, so that’s not what’s causing deaths, but what are the leading causes today?

Before you answer that question, give it a thought for a second. What’s your intuition about this? In the United States, what fraction of people die from car accidents? Is it as much as 10 percent of all deaths in a year? Or 15 percent? Or is it as low as 2 percent? How many people die from other kinds of accidents, like falls from a high ladder or slipping on a banana peel? Is that a significant fraction, or is it less than 1 percent?

What of different medical conditions? Do you have any idea what fraction of people die from heart attacks versus cancer versus infections? Which is a higher proportion of all deaths: medical causes or accidental causes? I realize that I don’t know the answers to these questions, even though it’s an important piece of data to know.

Figure 6.1

Cemeteries from the mid-nineteenth century show that people passed away from a surprising number of causes that we no longer think much about in the United States. The Civil War was one such cause, which we no longer worry about, along with malaria, yellow fever, and the flux.

Let’s reframe my wondering with two specific research questions.

Research Question 1: How many people die (from all causes) each year in the United States?

Research Question 2: What are the top five causes of death in the United States (as a fraction of the whole)?

There are two things that I’ve learned about intuitions over all my years of studying human behavior. First, even though we love to think of them as highly accurate and useful, they’re often wrong (especially about areas in which you have little expertise). And second, if you don’t write your intuitions down, you’ll quickly and unconsciously adjust them to align with the facts, once you figure out what they are. It’s almost as though we can’t stand to think of ourselves as making a mistake, so your mind will quickly back up and retroactively adjust your intuition to what you’ve learned. (「Oh … I knew that.」No you didn’t. You just changed your mind once you found out the reality.)

Knowing this is true, before I did any research on these questions (and at the risk of exposing my complete ignorance about such things), I wrote down a few of my intuitions, amplifying the research questions just a bit to make them measurable and easy to test. This way, I’ll know exactly what I learned.

Here’s how I amplified the questions.

A. What fraction of people die from car accidents in the United States each year?

B. How many people die from other kinds of accidents?

C. How many people die of different medical conditions?

D. What are the leading causes of death?

I noted my guesses before having done any research.

A. Car accidents: I guess it’s around 15 percent of all the US deaths per year

B. Other accidents not from cars: 5 percent per year

C. Medical conditions (not including old age): 50 percent

D. Leading causes of death (of any or all causes), in order: accidents, heart problems, and cancer

The obvious queries on different search platforms give different numbers. There’s variation in the answers even within a single search platform. Compare these results with slightly different queries on Google.

Notice that there’s a 250,000-person difference between these two numbers. Why? Because they come from different sources. The first query gives a short web answer from www.medicalnewstoday.com (which in turn gets its data from the 2014 Centers for Disease Control—aka the CDC—numbers), while the second query shows an answer that’s from Quora.com with data from the UN data source UNstats.un.org, and these numbers are from 2008.

Oddly, the first article tells us that the CDC data is no longer available. The link that the Medical News Today cites IS broken, but there is an obvious query you can do:

[CDC 2014 data deaths]

It takes you to the CDC’s「National Vital Statistics Report,」which has exactly the same number: 2,626,418 in 2014.1

If you click on the Quora link in the second query [how many people die each year in the us], the write-up there takes you to the UN Demographics Report from October 2017, which tells us the total number of deaths for 2015.2

Looking at that page, you see the entry for the United States.3

READ CAREFULLY: The Quora article says that「the most recent data available is from 2008.」But this data is from 2015 (the date is in the gray column), and the report was updated on October 16, 2017, yet notice that the number shown here is different from what’s in the summary! Here, the United Nations says it’s 2,712,630 deaths in 2015, as opposed to the 2,473,018 deaths reported in the 2008 UN summary seen in the web answer. Notice that we’re comparing deaths in 2008 versus 2015; of course there’s a big difference.
