# 0301. Do Lakes in Africa Sometimes Explode? How to Focus Your Search with「site:」and Using Specialized Terms

Can some lakes erupt and kill thousands of people? How would you find out?

Not long ago I was reading about a strange lake. I know what you’re thinking: How strange can a lake be? A lake’s a lake, right? In this case, the lake I’m thinking of seems not just strange but also deadly.

In particular, the lake I’d been reading about directly caused the death of a lot of people. The people didn’t drown, and their deaths weren’t due to something obvious (like a dam bursting) but rather were from something intrinsic to the lake itself.

This is the kind of article that makes me start doing research. It’s a fascinating topic, but the article itself was heavy on fluff and light on details. It had lots of exclamation points and adjectives like amazing, stunning, deadly, and awesome. There’s nothing wrong with these in general; they just don’t help me to understand what’s really going on here. I wanted to know if this was a real thing, and if so, how could a lake actually kill so many people?

As I read, it became clear that this strange lake is nothing like what you think about when you think of a lake. When you think of a「lake,」you probably have something like the following in mind (figure 3.1).

But there are deadly lakes. It’s not a poisonous lake (that is, you can go swimming in it without any harm coming to you), and it’s not a boiling lake, like this one in Yellowstone National Park.

So I had to think carefully about what such a「deadly lake」would be. Here’s the research question I wrote down to get started.

Research Question 1: Is there a lake somewhere in the world that could have somehow caused the death of nearly two thousand people?

Here’s what I did to find the answer.

To start this research, I did the simplest, fastest Google query I could think of:

[killer lake]

I know—this query seems way too obvious to work. Much to my surprise, this simple query leads you to quickly discover that Lake Nyos, in Cameroon, Africa, suddenly released a huge quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2) on August 21, 1986, killing nearly two thousand people who lived nearby. CO2 is heavier than air, so unless it’s stirred up by the wind, it pools close to the ground, leading to death by asphyxiation when the bubble of CO2 flowed silently over the nearby villages. Tragically, this happened at night, when many people were sleeping close to the ground, killing everyone and everything within a roughly 15-mile (or 24-kilometer) radius.1

Lake Nyos is a roughly circular lake known in the geology trade as a maar.2 A maar is a crater formed when a lava flow interacts violently with groundwater, blowing a giant hole in the ground. This particular maar lake is thought to have formed about four hundred years ago and is pretty deep (682 feet, or 208 meters), sitting on a porous layer of rubble, full of leftovers from earlier volcanic eruptions. CO2 seeps upward into the water as well as into the deep lake-bottom water. There, under pressure from the water above, the CO2 accumulates, with water pressure preventing the gas from bubbling up. It instead just dissolves into the water. In essence, this unusual configuration is creating highly pressurized soda water.

Research Question 2: How could such a thing happen? What would make it deadly?

If the lake were in a different place, seasonal temperature swings would mix the waters, preventing CO2 buildup. Cold weather causes surface waters to become dense and sink, displacing lower layers upward; in spring, the process reverses. But for equatorial lakes such as Nyos and nearby Lake Monoun, these deep layers seldom mix with the top layers. These waters might be unmixed for hundreds of years.

On that night in 1986, though, something happened to suddenly cause the waters to mix, bringing the carbonated water from the bottom to the top. One theory is that boulders crashing into the lake set it off. (There were signs of a recent rockslide nearby.) Or it could have been a wind-generated wave that hit the surface just wrong, causing a mixing of the layers. As the bottom layers of water saturated with CO2 started coming to the top, dissolved CO2 bubbled out of the solution, and the bubbles drew larger and larger until the lake exploded like a huge shaken seltzer bottle. This explosion also brought up iron-rich water, which oxidized at the surface and turned the lake red.

In the process of reading about this, I realized that the US Geological Survey (USGS) probably had a report or two on this that would give me the level of detail I wanted, so I did a search for:

[site:USGS.gov Lake Nyos]

It showed a number of great results. (Adding the site: at the beginning of the query means that the results will be limited to only web pages from the USGS.gov website.)

Figure 3.4

Search results for Lake Nyos that come only from USGS.gov; here I used the site: operator to limit the results to those from the USGS website.

This leads to several technical reports on the lake’s CO2 eruption. There’s a USGS final report with as much detail about the eruption as a geologist might want to read. (If you’re interested, I highly recommend this.)

After reading about this event for a bit, I learned that the technical term for this kind of sudden bubbling up of CO2 from a lake is a「limnic eruption.」I had no idea what a limnic eruption really is or how it works, so a quick search for this specialized term teaches me a good deal:

[limnic eruption]

Google gives me a bit more detail: a limnic eruption,「also referred to as a lake overturn, is a rare type of natural disaster in which dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) suddenly erupts from deep lake waters, forming a gas cloud that can suffocate wildlife, livestock, and humans.」This is starting to make sense; I’m finding multiple sources of information that are telling me the same things.


Figure 3.5

Now what about that wave?

This search takes us to several more research reports, including ones that tell us about the wave. The Washington Post reported it as being 80 feet high (bit.LY/TJOS-3-3), while a report from Duke University claims that the resulting wave was a「water surge 6 m high [that] flowed over the spillway at the northern end of the lake, and a fountain of water or froth had splashed over an 80-m-high rock promontory on the southwestern shore.」3 You can see the washed-away vegetation in this picture from the USGS.

If that barren promontory is the same one that was denuded by the post–limnic eruption wave, then it likely was an 80-meter wave, and not 80 feet. (It’s difficult to actually know without a better image or a topographic map to tell us the exact elevation, but if those are trees in the foreground, it well could be 80 meters.) And of course, this leads to another question.

Research Question 3: And how high did the eruption blow water into the sky?

To answer this question, I turned to Google ScholarA for a few reports written on the Lake Nyos eruption using the query (yes, the same query as before, but this time using just Google Scholar rather than the more general Google Web search):

[limnic eruption]

I quickly found a paper with the title「Dynamics of CO2-Driven Lake Eruption.」4

When you look up the author, Youxue Zhang, you’ll find that he’s in the University of Michigan geology department, and this paper was published in the science journal Nature. (Just so you’ll know, it’s quite hard to get things published there. So this is probably correct, at least to the best of our current knowledge.)

In this paper, Zhang creates a mathematical model of what happened in August 1986. And although he doesn’t have a picture of the event on that fatal day, his reasoning is pretty compelling, and he made the following diagram to show what probably happened (figure 3.6).

This shows that the limnic eruption caused a shower of lake water roughly 300 meters into the air. (Note also that Zhang has indicated a promontory height of 80 meters.) The water would have shot up from the lake surface at a top speed of around 199 miles per hour (or 320 kilometers per hour), which is incredibly violent. You would not want to be nearby when this happens, not just because of the high velocity water jet and rain of carbonated water, but because that’s when all the CO2 is released into the air. It’s probably a spectacular sight, but one that you’d want to watch from a safe distance.

Figure 3.7

So what’s going on with Lake Nyos today? It’s still dangerously full of high-pressure CO2, but there has been an effort to depressurize the lower levels of the lake by dropping a 200-meter tube from the surface to the lower part of the lake. As you might expect, when you make a connection between the surface and the pressurized bottom of the lake, you get a fountain, which they hope is removing the pressurized CO2 fast enough to prevent a similar disaster from happening in the future (figure 3.7).

But of course, where there’s one maar waiting to turn over, there might be others. Nearby, Lake Kivu could be another such lake with a huge CO2 reservoir just waiting for the right trigger to overturn and release its CO2 contents into the atmosphere (based on the USGS report on this hazard). If this happens, it could easily kill many more people, as there are around two million people living nearby.

Research Lessons

There are a few lessons here.

1. Short and obvious searches often work well. Much to my surprise, a query like [killer lake] actually led instantly to Lake Nyos. This startled me; there really haven’t been other killer lakes? Apparently not. The biggest lesson I pick up from this is that obvious queries work—but only if you have some kind of target in mind. (That is, [killer lake] isn’t the kind of query any normal person would do unless they were looking for something like the story behind Lake Nyos.)

2. Checking a known expert site (e.g., USGS.gov) is a great strategy for getting in-depth articles. While it’s easy to find lots of articles on Lake Nyos, scholarly ones are best when they come from a known source that does a lot of work in this area. In this case, I happened to know about the USGS in advance, so I just restricted my search to the articles and papers inside USGS.gov by using the site: operator. (This is probably the single operator that I use more than any other to limit search results to just those from one site.)

3. Specialized terms, when you learn them, are great! This is a lesson we’ve seen a bunch; when you see these special terms (or phrases, such as limnic eruption), use them for your search terms. (But be sure you know exactly what they mean or you might end up doing some time-wasting searches. And be sure to get your spelling right: a search for a limbus eruption will tell you a lot about diseases of the eye, and nothing about savage geology; that would be a limnic eruption.)

4. Triangulating multiple sources is a requirement when you’re doing research. As you see, there are reports of the tsunami being eighty feet … or eighty meters. That’s a huge difference. When you’re doing research like this, keep looking around; you might find different data (or points of view) around a topic—even things that should be easy to verify.

5. Remember that Google Scholar is a great collection of high-quality articles and papers that anyone can access for free. While it’s a collection of academic and scientific papers, it’s NOT just for academics but rather for everyone to use. Google Scholar gives everyone equal access to a rich source of knowledge that’s otherwise difficult to find. The kind of knowledge that you can discover in Google Scholar is comprehensive and authoritative, which makes it perfect for you to use when studying lakes that explode due to subterranean CO2 sources. If you’re researching something that’s a bit technical, do a search for your topic in Google Scholar as a way to get access to some of the best research and information available.

How to Do It

A. Google Scholar.

Google offers Scholar.Google.com as a collection of peer-reviewed scientific papers from journals, magazines, and technical conferences. It’s simple to use; just visit the site and do a search for the topic of your choice. For instance, the search I did above, [limnic eruption], gives different results on「regular」Google versus Google Scholar. The results from Google Scholar are going to be much more detailed and technical than those from Google.com; you won’t see any videos in Google Scholar results, but you will find authoritative articles written by geologists and research scientists from around the world.

Try This Yourself

While the USGS is the keeper of much of geologic data about the United States (and other places in the world as well), the British Geological Survey is the equivalent governmental organization in Britain. Its website is www.bgs.ac.uk. Now that you know its web address, you can use some of the key lessons of this chapter to answer questions that the British Geological Survey would have deep knowledge about. For instance, Stonehenge, the Paleolithic monument in Wiltshire, England, has many mysteries. (See figure 3.8.) One of these is how well known it was throughout the prehistoric world. Did people in other parts of Europe visit the site? For example, did people from the Mediterranean come to visit and maybe even stay at Stonehenge?

How would you make a query to find out?

Figure 3.8

Stonehenge has been around for more than four thousand years, yet it still has many unanswered questions. Can you find out if the British Geological Survey has reason to believe that people from the Mediterranean visited the site?

4 Things You Notice While Traveling: How and When to Switch Search Modes to Find Information

Satisfying your curiosity while on the road is usually a quick search on your mobile device. Here are some fast ways to get to the answers that you seek.

I don’t know about you, but when I’m traveling I often end up with small questions that arise during the day from reading the local news, listening to the radio on those long drives, or watching slightly sketchy TV in a random hotel room.

Mostly, these questions that pop up are fairly easy to answer, but they’re like mosquito bites—you’re not really satisfied until you know the answers. Here are a few questions that came up for me in my travels over the past couple of months. As they happen, I just jot them down and look these things up when I get home. How many of these have you also had?

Research Question 1: You’re driving a rental car into the gas station. Is there some way to tell (without getting out of the car) which side the gas cap is on? Is it on the left or right?

It’s really annoying to have to get out of the car, walk around, and discover it.

The answer is obvious, once you know. But I had to look it up; more important, I had to realize that this was a problem, a minor one to be sure, yet it’s a problem for which I could probably search out the answer. Here was my query: [car dashboard fuel side] (see figure 4.1).

Interestingly, this also led me to a Snopes.com article asking if the gas cap side was indicated by which side the pump handle on the ICON was on.1 I hadn’t thought of that interpretation. But no, it’s the triangle that points to the correct side of the car; the pump handle doesn’t actually indicate anything.

Figure 4.1

A quick query about fuel indicators on the dashboard uses just the essential query terms.

By the way, what’s the correct term for that part of the car where the gas cap is located? What’s it called? I did the following query:

[gas cap diagram]

I ended up finding out that the gas cap is the cover (the cap) on the「fuel filler hose」that leads to the fuel tank. Another term I didn’t know! In the process, I learned that this is the term you should use when looking up information about the「gas cap」in the booklet that came along with the car. The language that you and I might use to talk about gas caps isn’t necessarily the same as the language that people who write the manuals use.

Figure 4.2

The query [gas cap diagram] gives you a set of results that are all diagrams that have a gas cap in them somewhere. Adding the extra context term「diagram」is a handy search tip to know when you want to learn how things are built, organized, or laid out.

It’s also worth remembering this search trick of adding in a term that describes what you’re looking for; I call this a context term because it provides a bit more context for the kind of query results you want.

With this query, if you look in Google Images (which is probably where you’d expect to find the diagrams), you’ll find lots of useful diagrams showing you how the fuel filler hose is located, and where the cover is located.

Research Question 2: I saw Mount Rushmore, and while I was being amazed, I also wondered about how it was designed by the sculptor. What was the original design for Mount Rushmore? Was what we see today what he originally thought it would be? How different was the original design?

Figure 4.3

An early design had presidents shown to their waist rather than just their heads. But you stop sculpting when you run out of funding, as the project did in 1939.

My first query was intended to find the original design for the monument:

[Mount Rushmore original design]

It led to a number of sites, all of which pointed out that the original design was as shown in the photograph in figure 4.3. Of course, it was also going to be at a different location (at the rocky outcrop called Needles, not far away from where Mount Rushmore is), and Thomas Jefferson was originally supposed to be at George Washington’s left, until they found that the rock there wasn’t suited for sculpting.

With any project of this scale, there are many designs in the ramp up to actually getting it running. Another approach to answering this question would be to expect that there would be multiple models that were developed along the way and then do a query like this:

[Mount Rushmore models]

This gives a set of results showing that Gutzon Borglum (the sculptor) had many variations on the design of Mount Rushmore—so many that it’s difficult to identify just one as the「original.」The differences between the variations are fairly substantial, although the project was always going to be presidential.

The way Mount Rushmore looks today is quite different than the early designs.

Research Question 3: How do you know which is the「right」side of a towel? (Yes, there’s a right and wrong side. Have you been doing it wrong all these years?)

Yeah, who knew? I saw this while traveling in a seaside community. There was an ad for a special kind of beach towel that touted its especially wonderful「right side.」What? How could a towel have a wrong side? That made me wonder, IS there a right and wrong side to a towel?

This was a quick and simple query; [towel right wrong side] found many articles telling me that the side with the long loops (and therefore more surface area) is the side meant for drying. The side with the short loops is meant for everything else (maybe sitting on the beach?). As with many things like this, use the side you like.

Figure 4.5

Most towels have long loops on one side, and short loops on the other. The side with long loops is somewhat more absorbent, making it the right side for drying off.

Research Question 4: People keep saying things, but I don’t know what they mean! For instance, just today, someone said,「It was taken care of in one fell swoop.」What does「one fell swoop」mean?

I’d start this piece of research with the straightforward:

[one fell swoop]

Again, the search is easy, but finding the answer at PhraseFinder tells me that it means「a sudden action」and comes from William Shakespeare’s play Macbeth.2 The original use was in this bit of dialogue:

MACDUFF: (on hearing that his family and servants have all been killed)

All my pretty ones?

Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?

What, all my pretty chickens and their dam

At one fell swoop?

Here, Shakespeare uses the imagery of a hunting bird (in this case, a「hell-kite」; you could go look it up!) that did a「fell swoop」to suggest the animal and savage nature of the deadly attack on Macduff’s family by Macbeth’s assassins.

The「swoop」is when a raptor (such as the「kite」mentioned in line two) makes a sudden, rapid descent from on high, usually called a「stoop」today. The stoop is the way that raptors stun and kill their prey. They literally「swoop」down on them.「Fell」as an adjective here just means「evil」or「fierce.」Today this phrase has come to mean「a sudden stroke, action, or attack.」

Research Question 5: At a small country store, I heard someone say,「Oh, heavens to murgatroyd!」Really? What does that even mean? And who said this originally anyway?

You have to be a bit cautious when searching for etymologies (the origin of words and phrases); in general, they’re complicated. But as a first guess, my search was:

[heavens to murgatroid]

Notice that I left the「oh」out of the phrase. When you’re searching for quotes or phrases, usually the best way is to search for just the core of the phrase—that is, the part that’s probably going to be preserved over multiple tellings and repetitions. I also did NOT put it in quotes because I figured that this sequence of words would be idiosyncratic enough to work.

I got the following search result (figure 4.6).

The search is quietly telling me that my search is actually misspelled. Who knew? The correct spelling is listed in the helpful phrase,「Showing results for murgatroyd.」That wasn’t what I originally put in my query, which was「murgatroid.」(If I was convinced that my spelling was correct, I could put that single word in double quotesA, which would then turn off spell correcting.

Looking at these results, we can see that at very least, it was said by the cartoon character Snagglepuss.

Out of sheer curiosity, I clicked on several of the top ten results, including the Wikipedia entry that directed me back to PhraseFinder. It turns out that our friends at PhraseFinder have a story for this too. They claim that「heavens to murgatroyd」was first uttered by Bert Lahr (an actor best known as the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz movie) in the 1944 film Meet the People. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball star in this World War II era musical revue. Ball plays a popular but stuck-up Broadway star who leaves the bright lights to become a welder in a shipyard as a way to contribute to the war effort. Here she meets and falls in love with coworker Powell. Since this is a wartime musical, the plotline is periodically abandoned for guest star cameos of famous actors (of the time) Virginia O’Brien and Lahr, and musical groups like the Vaughn Monroe Orchestra or Spike Jones and His City Slickers.

Figure 4.6

Searching for a common phrase works well, even if you misspell it.

While that was the phrase’s first appearance, it was popularized by the 1959 Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Snagglepuss, a pink mountain lion with grand aspirations to be an actor. Interestingly, the voice of Snagglepuss was originally by actor Dawes Butler, who obviously imitated the voice style of Lahr playing the Cowardly Lion. That voice style was so similar that Lahr sued Kellogg’s when it used Snagglepuss in some of its TV commercials. Lahr was concerned that viewers might think that he was endorsing the cereal. As part of the settlement, subsequent commercials with Snagglepuss had to have a credit line saying,「Snagglepuss voice by Dawes Butler,」making Butler quite possibly the only voice actor to get a credit line in a commercial!

Now that we’ve found that this is a common exclamation by the character of Snagglepuss, watching one or two videos quickly tells us that it’s a general phrase of exasperation, a bit like「oh heavens to Betsy.」Of course, I now wonder who Betsy was—but I’ll leave that for you to find out on your own.

Research Question 6: In the story of David and Goliath, David kills the giant with a single stone from his sling. Is this really possible? What kind of a slingshot could do that?

A simple query, [David sling stone] or [David slingshot], leads to a wealth of information about the「traditional sling」(as opposed to the surgical tube or heavy rubber band version).

A traditional sling is just a length of twine (or leather) with a small pocket into which you can place a stone or small projectile. David’s traditional sling would have looked like the following (no rubber bands needed).

How powerful can such a sling be? Isn’t this just a kid’s plaything?

Figure 4.7

The classical sling from biblical times is made of string and a woven pocket for the stone—simple, effective, and deadly.

The sling is simple to make and yet much more powerful than you’d think. When I was in high school, I read an interesting article in Scientific American on「The Sling as a Weapon」(1973).3 Being a teen, I made one and proceeded to test it out. I chose a smooth stone about one inch (two centimeters) in diameter, whirled it around my head a couple of times, and let it fly. The stone hit the side of our wood-shingle-sided garage and went THROUGH the wall!

Fascinated, I quickly found that I could easily put such a stone through a quarter-inch plywood at twenty paces. (I quickly stopped testing in my backyard because I realized a missed shot could easily break windows and potentially really hurt someone. This simple sling has enormous power. I soon came to believe that it could kill someone, including Goliath-sized giants.)

On a trip to the seashore, I ended up slinging stones out into the ocean, and got them going fast and far enough that I’d often lose sight of them before they hit the water. From my perspective, they’d just disappear into the distance.

One of the best sources I found is the website Slinging.org (its tagline is「Stone Age ballistics」), which has an extensive list of publications about slings and their use as well as a lot of practical advice.

While there is a great debate about whether or not the stone actually killed Goliath by striking him in the forehead (wasn’t he wearing a helmet?), there’s no doubt that a sling could seriously injure and quite possibly kill someone.

That first query led me to a lot of results, so I found myself scanning through them, trying to pick out the articles that would tell me more about the uses of slings and stones as weapons. One of those articles was a rather-promising one by Eric Skov that appeared in a 2011 issue of Nebraska Anthropologist titled「Sling Technology: Towards an Understanding of Capabilities.」4

I read fairly widely, but even I’m not in the habit of reading back issues of the Nebraska Anthropologist, yet after I read this article, I might have to start.

In this article on the devastating power of the sling, Skov shows pretty conclusively that a relatively small lead bullet flung by a sling could easily penetrate the skull, allowing even a relatively small shepherd boy to take down a giant. David and Goliath indeed. (Of course, if you’re interested in what seems like an uneven fight, I have to recommend Malcolm Gladwell’s book David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants, if only for his telling of the David and Goliath story, emphasizing that David was a smart kid who knew how powerful a sling in a shepherd’s skilled hand could be.)5

To this day, slings are still being used in the Middle East, where they’re powerful weapons in the hands of people who have used them for thousands of years.

Research Lessons

The real lesson here is obvious.

1. Look up stuff that’s interesting, unknown, or unclear. Learn to recognize the little annoyances that you can reframe as a small research question. In my case, the hassle of getting out and looking for the darn gas cap was annoying enough to make me wonder,「Has anyone else had this problem?」Hence my query above. And hence all these queries that came from this. None of them are difficult, so it really shows how much great content is available, if only you go and look for it!

2. Adding a context term (like diagram) to your search can tailor the results toward useful information sources. Adding in a context term is something that expert searchers do when they want to limit the search results to a particular kind of result. Other useful context terms also describe the kinds of results that you might want to see. For instance, adding the term album (when looking for a collection of images on a topic), glossary (to find collections of words on a particular topic), or overview (when you’re looking for a short summary on a given subject).

3. Putting a single word in double quotes makes Google search for that word without any spell corrections or substitutions. This is useful when you’re looking for an intentionally misspelled word (for instance, when you’re searching for a word that’s spelled as part of a dialect, such as「dat」for「that」), or a place-name with a spelling that’s close to a regular word (such as「Noble,」which is close to「Nobel」yet different at the same time).

How to Do It

A. Single word in double quotes.

It might seem odd to do a search with a single word in double quotes (like the following).

There ARE times when you want to override the Google spelling corrector and use the search term the way you specified it. In this case, Darwwen is a friend with an unusual spelling of his name (figure 4.8). In cases like that, you can put double quotes around the search term to mean search for exactly this term. (You are implicitly telling Google,「Please don’t help out by fixing the spelling for me; this is really what I mean.」)

Of course, most of the time the spelling correction is what you want. But this gives you a way to get around that system if you need to do so. (As in this example, it’s most often for unusual spellings of names.)

Figure 4.8

Double quoting a single word will return results with exactly that word. There’s a suggestion for a more standard spelling, but you can ignore that and see only the results with this (slightly unusual) name.

Try This Yourself

This chapter is really about how to quickly satisfy your curiosity when you see something that piques your interest. When this happens to you, you needn’t just wonder about it; now you can go do a bit of research to find out the backstory.

For example, the other day while driving down a country road in Arizona, I noticed a series of small signs that rhymed when read aloud. This series of signs read:

If daisies are

your favorite flower

keep pushing up

those miles per hour!

People have told me that this was once a common sight on roads in the United States, but no longer.

Who put up these signs, and why? What was the point? (Think: How would you search for something like this playful poetry?)
