1. For background on cemeteries as places for family visits, and why running through one isn’t as crazy as it seems, see Keith Eggener, Cemeteries (New York: Library of Congress Visual Sourcebooks, 2010). This book has a lovely essay describing our changing attitudes about what’s appropriate behavior in a cemetery, and how cemeteries led to the design of America’s first public parks.

5. Interestingly, Key wrote a different set of lyrics for the same tune in 1805, but this earlier version was about the First Barbary War and its US Navy hero Stephen Decatur. In essence, Key was recycling an earlier idea, with some of the lyrics being partly reused in the「Defence of Fort M’Henry.」

7. Yes, that Aaron Burr, who, despite shooting Alexander Hamilton in their famous duel, went on to serve out the remainder of his term as vice president, all charges having been dropped. But he then went on to be accused of conspiracy to set up his own nation in the lands along the Ouachita River, in what is now Louisiana. Key was an assistant lawyer in this case.

9. Teresa Sickles (nee Bagioli) was fifteen (or sixteen, depending on which account you read) when she married Dan Sickles. Together, she and Key II attended parties and were generally well known to Washington, DC, society as an unusual couple since neither seemed to be regularly in the company of their spouses.

11. This is a variation on the so-called Pomodoro Technique of setting a timer to break up study sessions into small, timed segments, with breaks between each twenty-five-minute interval to help in assimilating what you’ve studied thus far. I use this idea, but tend to set my timer for one hour. When the timer goes off, I do that same collecting of what I’ve learned so far, summarizing my notes, and assimilating.

12. It’s called the Matthew effect after the verse in the New Testament’s Book of Matthew where it is written in 13:12 that「for whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.」That is, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.

5. In the days before cameras on every phone, and before cheap photocopying, it was common practice to have a younger seaman write up copies of every letter that went out from the captain.

3. Why did I choose these particular guys as an example? I was wondering if they were all contemporaries and could have all met over a hypothetical dinner. Once you see their timelines, it’s obvious that they were. In this case, knowing how to do a simple query that creates a visualization really enhances your understanding of timelines and contemporary events.

6. There are many articles that point this out, but for perhaps the best one, see James R. Dwyer,「Public Response to an Academic Library Microcatalog,」Journal of Academic Librarianship 5, no. 3 (1979): 132–141. In this piece, Dwyer shows that the probability of reading a book varies as the cube of the distance from the catalog. That is, you’re more likely to access a text if it’s close (or fast) to get to it. Something that’s ten feet away is far more likely to be used than something that’s a hundred feet away. The difference is dramatic.

11. Knowing how to use the Internet Archive is increasingly becoming a basic research skill. But that’s material for the next book. Luckily, as a skilled online researcher, you have the ability to search for the information you need to use it effectively. To get to the Internet Archive, see https://archive.org/.

12. One such bit of regulation is the「right to be forgotten」ruling, which allows people and institutions to require Google to remove specific articles from search results about them. This is an effort to allow bad (or out-of-date) content to be unfindable, but the possibility of misuse is huge.

13. Last search tip of the book: when you see a fragment of language that sounds a bit different than everything around it, such as this phrase「like tears in rain,」it’s usually worth doing a quick search to understand what it means. Don’t let the meaning slip away in your reading.
