11 Can You Die from Apoplexy or Rose Catarrh? How to Find (and Use) Old, Sometimes-Archaic or Obsolete Terminology

How does language change over time? We’ve changed the names of a few important things over the past hundred years. Here’s how to do your online research and not get confused when things change names.

One of the greatest problems with the past is that the language they spoke then is different than what we speak (or write, blog, or inscribe on our cars) now. You’d think that English is English, but the truth is that there’s a fairly high rate of turnover in the language. New words enter, and old ones leave, but there’s also a shift in the meaning of some words with time. (Depending on how old you are,「bad」means, well, bad, but in the mid-1940s, the 1960s, and again in the 1980s,「bad」had a slang meaning of「good!」Go figure. I have no idea why「bad」meant「bad」in the 1950s.)

As a consequence, when you’re trying to search for historical content, you sometimes (often?) have to shift your language to accommodate the way that authors in the past would have written.

For instance, when I was young, I grew up learning about a dinosaur that was then called the brontosaurus. The way these things go, the name was more or less rescinded in favor of apatosaurus, and then brought back a few years later when a newer, finer distinction was made between the brontosaurus and apatosaurus.1 If you’re curious, you can go read that article to get the whole story about the name changes (and why they keep changing the name back and forth). It’s an interesting story about science, with the scientists wanting to be clear about what they’re studying.

But the reason I bring it up here is that terms can change significantly over time. One dinosaur name goes away and then comes back. If you think about it, a lot of our language has shifted.「Boers」became「Afrikaners,」people who were「insane」became「mentally ill,」and the phrase「outdoor relief」became commonly known as「public welfare,」and so on. Of course, this is particularly useful to know if you’re trying to do online research, especially about historical ideas.

This terminological shift (a great phrase to use at your next party!) showed up a bit in my own research recently. Here’s an example.

I was doing a bit of reading about the US Civil War (1861–1865) and had read in one source that many of the soldiers died from some kind of disease that had extensive diarrhea. Given the sanitation conditions at the time, that’s not surprising. What WAS startling was the claim that more soldiers died of disease than from actual combat. I know that around 2 percent of the entire US population perished during the war (that is, around 625,000 souls). How much of that was due to disease rather than direct fighting? Yet when I search in writings from that time, I find lots of diarrhea, but I seem to be missing many of the references that would help me figure this out.

Research Question 1: Is there some other term (or terms) I SHOULD be using to search in archival accounts from that period for this disease?

There are several ways to find terms for medical conditions used during the US Civil War. Here are a couple of methods.

Search explicitly for synonyms of terms that you know about. That is, start with a specific disease you can name, and look for uses during that period:

[diarrhea during the us civil war]

This leads us to a few documents that give us several synonyms for diarrhea: dysentery, quickstep, flux, and「alvine flux」by the doctors. Unfortunately, doctors knew neither how soldiers contracted the condition nor how the diseases should be treated. Likewise, do a search for:

[diarrhea synonyms]

It will give us a bunch more synonyms (Delhi belly, flux, Montezuma’s revenge, runs, trots, and turista), but for each of these you have to check to be sure they’re Civil War period relevant. For example, looking at the Google Ngram chart for「Delhi belly」shows that it didn’t come into use until the late 1940s.2

Figure 11.2

The term「Delhi belly」didn’t come into common use until the 1940s. This chart is made using Google Ngrams, which shows how often a word (or phrase) occurs in the Google Books collection over the past two hundred years.

Unfortunately, checking Ngrams for「flux」doesn’t work because it’s a common industrial term as well. We want only the interpretation of「flux」as it applies to our research. So we have to confirm that「flux」is a Civil War era term by doing a simple query:

[flux Civil War]

This leads us straight to a glossary of Civil War medical terms and confirmations that「flux」was a common term for diarrhea.3

For these kinds of historical topics, it’s worth checking Google Books with a search like:

[Civil War language disease]

That leads us quickly to The Language of the Civil War, confirming「flux」and「bloody flux.」4

The disease problem was massive. Soldiers had to contend not just with the fighting but also with typhoid, pneumonia, measles, tuberculosis, and malaria. An indication of just how bad this was during the war is shown in this chart from the Civil War Trust (figure 11.3).5

As you can see, MOST of the deaths during the American Civil War were due to disease; there were many terms, but any diarrheal problem was often called flux, quickstep, or trots. Those (along with regular old diarrhea, in all its misspellings, which were common at the time) are the search terms to use

Of course, not all disease is fatal, but when you’re reading texts from the late nineteenth century, you’ll frequently come across language that’s archaic or just plain puzzling.

For instance, while reading about the death and destruction of flux/influenza, I happened across an unfamiliar term: rose catarrh. When I did a search for [rose catarrh], the definitions were a fairly unhelpful「rose cold.」Really? That’s it? So I kept at it, looking further and further down the list of results until I finally found a slightly more useful definition:「a variety of hay fever, sometimes attributed to the inhalation of the effluvia of roses.」(This was from the 1913 edition of Webster’s dictionary; you can tell because the word「effluvia」has such a nineteenth-century feel to it. Of course, my first reaction was to do a quick definition search on Google: [define effluvia], which tells me that it’s「an unpleasant or harmful odor, secretion, or discharge, such as ‘the unwholesome effluvia of decaying vegetable matter.’」

Figure 11.3

It’s easy to see that deaths due to disease (the red bars on top) significantly outnumber deaths due to actual fighting.

Naturally, this made me curious about what「rose catarrh」meant back in those latter days of the 1800s. My query was:

[「rose catarrh」19th century]

I was happy to see not just some articles on it but also images that lead to newspaper stories from the period (figure 11.4).

With these hits, it’s easy to quickly understand that rose catarrh is just what we now call hay fever—that is, an allergic reaction to pollen, dust, and so on. In the late 1800s, it was one of those things that caused all kinds of advertisements, each peddling patent medicine cures. Here’s one from the Los Angeles Daily Herald, March 31, 1887, 6 (figure 11.5).6

So rose catarrh won’t kill you; you won’t die from it, you’ll just feel crummy. And of course it’s a phrase that’s fallen out of the language along with flux and quickstep.

Figure 11.4

Searching for the phrase「rose catarrh」and the context term「19th century」gives a set of results that tells us that it’s just a variety of hay fever. The images of「rose catarrh」on the page link directly to news stories (and advertising) from that period.

Reading widely is a dangerous thing to do. As I was reading about the Civil War era, as I was reading through newspapers of the time about rose catarrh, I was struck by the number of times that I saw stories and advertisements for the amazing curative and restorative power of hot springs. If the war didn’t kill you, a dip in the hot springs would surely make you better. But then I was led to this research question, which naturally follows from the first one.

Research Question 2: These days, it’s popular to go to a spa that features natural hot springs, such as those at Big Sur (California), Wiesbaden (Germany), or Bath (England). But if I’m searching for such a spa to visit in 1890s’ America just after the Civil War, what search terms should I use?7

Figure 11.5

Again, the problem here is to find terms that were used during this time to describe a spa with hot springs.

As we did above, you can get started by doing standard synonym queries and poking around in Wikipedia articles, looking for alternative phrases.

But I decided to go to one of the contemporary sources: archival newspapers. I found the Library of Congress’s Chronicling America newspaper collection by doing a search for the following:8

[online archival newspapers]

Then, once there, I limited the dates of my search to 1890–1899, and searched for「Saratoga Springs」(a place that I already knew as a famous natural springs resort popular during those days). My idea was to search for newspaper accounts of the place and see how the articles referred to it.

Figure: 11.6

My query gave me a page that looked like the following (figure 11.6).

All the red boxes you see on the page are hits for the string「Saratoga Springs.」

Within a couple of minutes, I found those springs referred to as: sanitarium, tonic spring, sulphur springs, soda springs, and commonly, just plain-old hot springs.

I’m sure that if I kept reading, I’d find other ways to refer to these kinds of therapeutic resorts with springs. But this is a great list, and it comes directly from the writing of the times.

Interestingly, the best way to pick up on these alternative descriptions was to read through the advertisements. Often the language is colorful and the claims are extravagant yet completely fun to read! Here’s one from a place at the edge of today’s Silicon Valley.

I too want to relax at a place where the「Ogre Malaria Never Lifts His Ghastly Head and Where the Waters of Healing Pour Freely from Nature’s Own Fountain.」9 And now I know that if I want to look for all the expressions of what we think of today as「hot springs,」I should also search for「tonic spring,」「soda spring,」「sulphur spring,」and so on.

That is, I’d do a search like this:

[19th century「hot springs」OR「tonic springs」OR「soda springs」OR「sulphur springs」]

Such a search would get the widest-possible range of results for the warm, healing, sometimes-smelly waters that people of the day would enjoy.

Research Question 3: While reading about the Civil War time period, my attention wavered for a few moments as I read about the binoculars of the period, thereby leading me to read about the life of John Dollond (the inventor of the achromatic lens, for which you should be grateful), and I learned that he died of a stroke. But oddly, I can’t find period accounts with「stroke」as a search term. Is this another term that has changed since the mid-nineteenth century? What search term should I use instead to find an eighteenth-century death by stroke?

I spent quite a bit of time searching the newspapers and books of the time for「John Dollond」and「stroke,」but not getting much of any useful results.

Now we know that searching directly for synonyms can often give us lots of options, but then we need to verify that the term was used during that time period.

My first query was:

[stroke synonym]

That led me to the only term I hadn’t heard of before: apoplexy. (Well to be honest, I’d heard of this word before, but I wasn’t really sure what it meant!)

I did a quick define search:

[define apoplexy]

It confirmed that it means a「stroke.」

How do we confirm that this was being used in the 1700s? The Ngram’s database only goes back to 1800, and many of the newspaper archives are limited to post-1800 as well.

But Books.Google.com goes WAAY back! By searching in Google Books for「apoplexy」and limiting the time range to 1700–1799, we see the following (figure 11.8).

I scanned down a bit to find a book that has a readable (to my modern eyes) explanation of apoplexy and found it in the 1793 book by Samuel Auguste David Tissot: Advice to People in General, with Respect to Their Health. Translated from the French. … To Which Are Added, by the Author, Two New Chapters; One upon Inoculation, the Other upon Lingering Distempers. … The Sixth Edition, Corrected and Improved.10

In this book, we find the following definition (figure 11.9).

I like the image here of「inflammable blood, and that in a large quantity …」But you get the idea. Apoplexy is the word we seek when we need to search for people who died of a stroke in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In particular, using this new (old!) synonym for「stroke,」I searched for:

[John Dolland apoplexy]

Figure 11.8

A search for「apoplexy」in Google Books with the date range restricted to the eighteenth century shows a number of books that you can read. If you check some of these references, it’s clear that「apoplexy」means「stroke」in a medical sense.

I quickly found an account of his death in the Gentleman’s Magazine (1820), not long after he was appointed to be a Fellow of the Royal Society and optician to the king. As the article points out, he「did not live to enjoy his honours long, as he died of apoplexy, Nov. 30, in the same year.」11

But you see the point. To find this account of his death, we had to use language appropriate to the time. In this case, we had to search for apoplexy rather than stroke.

If you want to search for terms that are even older than the nineteenth century, you’ll want to know about a historical thesaurus, such as the Historical Thesaurus of English (for English words over the past several centuries).12 This is the resource you’ll want to use if you’re doing research in a time period that’s different from your own. (And it’s an alternate way to do this particular search.)

Figure 11.9

Page 55 of the above-mentioned book. Recall that the letter that looks like an f is in fact a long S. Thus,「fudden」is「sudden,」and「ferrous apoplexy」is「serous apoplexy,」where「serous」means「of serum」—that is, an apoplexy that was believed to be caused by an excess of a watery serum in the brain.

The Historical Thesaurus of English has all the words from Old English days until now—in both obsolete and current definitions—all extracted from the Oxford English Dictionary, and organized by their meanings and dates of use. This way, each word shows up in its own era, demonstrating how even simple words have changed.

For instance, if you want to look for a disease symptom like「fever,」you’ll need to use different words depending on the time period that you’re interested in. Using the Historical Thesaurus of English, you’ll learn that「fever」would be written as feferadl in the tenth century, febricitation in the sixteenth century, pyrexia in the eighteenth, and febrility in the nineteenth.

In the end, language shifts happen all the time—and relatively quickly. As we found out, you can die of apoplexy, but not of rose catarrh. On the other hand, if you do have rose catarrh, you might well have a feferadl.

Research Lessons

1. Search for synonyms, but check that the synonyms you find are appropriate to the time period. As we saw, the obvious search for synonyms will often offer up old-fashioned and even archaic terms for an idea that you seek. But you have to check that this term is the right one for the time. You can search for synonyms for terms using a context term like「19th century,」but remember that newspapers or books of the period can be incredibly good resources. And if you go far enough back, check a historical thesaurus for specific terms in that specific time period.

2. You might find multiple terms! It shouldn’t be a surprise, but people frequently have different ways to refer to a common concept. (If you think about it for a second, you can probably call to mind a few different ways to refer to diarrhea in your own language. It shouldn’t surprise you that this was true in the past as well.)

3. A great way to find old terminology is to check out old newspapers and books. The simplest way to do this is via online archival newspapers (e.g., those at the Library of Congress newspaper collection, Chronicling America) or in a books database that has a collection from the deep past (such as Books.Google.com or the Hathi Trust).13

4. If you go far enough back, sometimes the characters themselves are different. Text that looks like a「fudden lofs」is actually a「sudden loss」—especially true in books from the eighteenth century. In Google Books, however, the long S character is recognized as an actual s, so when you search within the text of the book, just search for「sudden loss」and you’ll find the correct text (even though it might not look like it).

Try This Yourself

Language changes over time, often in profound ways. It’s important to know this when you’re searching for something archival or historical.

If you want to see for yourself, try searching for information in a topic area that you know well—and then carry that search back in time for sources that discuss your favorite things, but from a century earlier.

Say that you’re interested in football (the US kind). How has the language of that sport changed over time? What’s a「momentum mass play,」「wingback,」or「rush line」? Or in baseball, what was a「Baltimore chop」or「dirt dipper」?

Likewise, you could look at the changes in language for a technology over time. Train locomotives have changed considerably over time. What’s「induced drafting」or a「thermic syphon」? Do those devices have equivalents in today’s locomotives, or have they, like buggy whips, vanished into the dark recesses of language?

As you look backward in time, consider how you might find collections of terms that would be useful to you. How do you find old-fashioned, out-of-date, or archaic terms in a particular field?

12 What’s That Wreck Just Offshore? How to Find Archival Imagery and Use Metadata from Photographs

A strange pile of wreckage just offshore, map, strange story of wrecks, dancing pavilion, and possible arson. How can we solve a cold case through online research? Learn how to use online maps and archival news sources.

On a Saturday, I went for a run on a beautiful summer day along the shoreline of the Carquinez Straits, where the Sacramento River flows serenely into San Francisco Bay before heading out to the Pacific Ocean. As I cruised the southern shore of the straits, I ran past a big pile of iron and steel sticking up out of the water just a few yards offshore in fairly shallow water (figure 12.1).

Being a curious sort of fellow, I took a picture with my phone and kept going on my run, knowing that later I could figure out what it was all about.

But seeing this wreck left me with a few questions.

Research Question 1: What’s the story of this wreck? What was it? Did it have a name? Why is it here?

First I knew it was a cell phone photo, so there would be EXIF metadata attached to it. It’s a simple process to extract the EXIF data from the photoA. I also knew that the EXIF metadata would have a fairly accurate latitude and longitude of the wreck’s location. It turns out that when I took the picture, I was standing at 38.054242, −122.20228.

I started by going to Google Maps to get a look around, just to see what things might be nearby that I could use as search terms. Here’s what I saw when I put that latitude/longitude into the Google Maps search box (figure 12.2).

But that’s too wide a view of that location on the map to be useful. I thought I should zoom in a bit to see more detail.

Figure 12.1

Seeing this wreckage just a few yards offshore made me curious. Why is there a shipwreck in the Carquinez Straits, not far from San Francisco Bay?

And what do you know? There’s the answer right there on the map! At exactly the place where my「hunk of junk」lay, the map has a label in the water marked as「Garden City Wreckage」(figure 12.3).

Longtime Google Maps users know that there are layers of information that show up at different zoom levels. Unfortunately you can’t turn them on/off individually but instead have to manually zoom in and out until the layer you want appears. In this case, I got lucky that it had shown up. (If it hadn’t, I would have used other clues shown here such as「Eckley Pier,」「Bull Valley,」or the nearby town of「Port Costa」as place-names. I’d have found it that way.)

Yet as often happens, someone else had already marked this particular spectacular junk pile. I switched to Google Earth view and zoomed way in to see if it was what I thought it was. Here’s the satellite image (and it’s clearly the same, although at low tide). (See figure 12.4.)

Now that I know it’s the「Garden City」(and probably a boat of some kind), I had to figure out the story.

I did a query for:

[「Garden City」wreckage]

The Google News archives returns a number of hits, many of which tell the story of how the good ship Garden City was built in 1879 as a side-wheel ferry for the South Pacific Coast Railroad to move train cars to San Francisco.1

Although the Garden City was built with narrow-gauge track on the main deck to carry freight cars to San Francisco, it could also carry passengers and cars as a relief ferry. Southern Pacific used the Garden City as a relief boat for its auto ferry run on the old「creek route.」The Garden City stayed on the creek route as a passenger ferry when auto ferry service was shifted to the Oakland pier.

The ferry ran from Alameda to San Francisco until 1929, when it was brought to the piers at the town of Eckley as a fishing resort and bit of a dance hall. Unfortunately that was its last assignment before becoming a picturesque wreck.

Figure 12.5

In this shot from the water, you can clearly see the boilers and engine remains from the Garden City ferry.
