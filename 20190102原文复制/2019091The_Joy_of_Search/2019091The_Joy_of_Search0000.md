The Joy of Search: A Google Insider’s Guide to Going Beyond the Basics

Daniel M. Russell

## Acknowledgments

I’m grateful to Don Norman for saying,「You know, your SearchResearch blog really wants to be a book.」He’s the guy who really got this book project started with early guidance and encouragement. 

Thanks for the push.

Thanks also to Ira Chinoy, who also gave me a wagonload of encouragement in the process of figuring out what this book should be. We share a passion for research and archives—both valuable qualities in science and journalism.

Thanks to Sam Wineburg for pushing on the idea that we should understand how good searchers operate. His work and our conversations have been important in developing my understanding about how people do their research — and how they can improve.

Thanks to all the regular readers of my blog, SearchResearch. There are too many to name (and in many cases, I only know their blog names), but I want to mention frequent contributors Remmij, José Ramón Gonzalez, Jon-the-Unknown, Mike Ross, Rosemary, Anne Piascik, Debra Gottsleben, Passager, Luís Miguel Viterbo, Jeff Dowdy, Judith Koveleskie, Michael Michelmore, Clayton Lewis, and GRayR. There were many, many others over past four years; thanks to you all.

My appreciation to Mimi Ito for reminding me that most people think of online research as a pedestrian skill that shouldn’t need any teaching. That’s a humbling perspective that’s completely right. She pointed out that this book needs to be intrinsically interesting. She’s correct.

Thanks to the publication people at Google for letting me push the boundaries just a bit (with special appreciation to Peter Norvig, David Price, and Crystal Dahlen for reading everything!).

A huge thanks to my manager at Google, Scott Huffman, for allowing me to take the time needed to write this book.

I’m grateful to my family, especially my wife, Lynne, who always has the best ideas and critiques; my daughter, Katie, for copyediting help; and my son, Chris, for putting up with me during all the writing and endless questions.

In addition, I had a couple of good friends who invested a large amount of time in reading early drafts, and giving profuse and excellent commentary. Thanks to Robin Jeffries for valiantly reading early drafts of each chapter with depth and rigor. Luís Miguel Viterbo read with a valuable European perspective, which I deeply appreciated. Katie Russell has an eagle eye for copyediting — a skill that she did not inherit from me! Many thanks to Roz Foster, my literary agent, for walking me through my first book publication project (let’s do some more!). Thanks also to Ann Awakuni Fernald, who has been wading through the texts with me, pruning, organizing, and tracking down permissions with great care.

And of course, a huge thanks to all the engineers, product managers, and researchers at Google. This book would not have been possible without your superhuman work.
