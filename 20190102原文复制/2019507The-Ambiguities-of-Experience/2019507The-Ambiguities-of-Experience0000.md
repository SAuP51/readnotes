THE AMBIGUITIES OF EXPERIENCE

## PREFACE

The chapters in this book are based on three Messenger Lectures given at Cornell University in October 2008. I am grateful to the university and particularly to my hosts, Victor Nee and Danielle Adams, who made the visit a pleasure for me. Parts of the material are based on talks I have given at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of California, Irvine. For their able assistance in preparing the manuscript for publication, I owe thanks to three Cornell University Press editors: Roger Haydon, Priscilla Hurdle, and Ange Romeo-Hall, as well as to Jamie Fuller. The index was prepared by Daniel Newark.

The book focuses on a few small aspects of a simple question: What is, or should be, the role of experience in creating intelligence, particularly in organizations? The chapters presented here are intended to provide fragments of a partial answer to that question. The fragments represent a sampler of possible ideas rather than a comprehensive encyclopedia of them. They provide incomplete ruminations on the ideas rather than thorough expositions of them. The small number of words in the book may be somewhat balanced by the large number of references (a testimony to authorial inadequacy), including an excessive number of self-references (a testimony to authorial self-indulgence).

Although they might with justice claim that I have extracted lessons from their teachings that are not what they intended, seven talented colleagues and friends have contributed substantially to the ideas here and must share some of the blame: Mie Augier, who bridges the chasms among Sch√ºtz, Kundera, Plath, Nietzsche, and Dosi with a combination of enthusiasm and skepticism that I admire; Barbara Czarniawska, who has tried patiently for many years to teach me about stories, narratives, and organization theory; Jerker Denrell, who has made my life better through conversations about endogenous sampling, learning, and the wonders of stochastic processes; Daniel Levinthal, with whom I have shared many years of conversation and collaboration on problems of organizational learning; Johan P. Olsen, whose wisdom, careful scholarship, and friendship inform everything I do, and particularly the topics covered here; William H. Starbuck, whose contributions to understanding the problems and possibilities of learning in organizations span almost as many years as mine; and Sidney Winter, whose reluctance to write his thoughts is matched only by their fruitfulness when he gets around to it. I will not try to list the many others to whom I owe debts. I once did that, and it took up several pages of text.

I have benefited from generous financial support by the Spencer Foundation, the Reed Foundation, the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the Stanford University School of Education, and the Copenhagen School of Business. I appreciate both their support and the spirit of free inquiry in which it has been provided.

Finally, I owe a large debt to the infinite tolerance of my wife, Jayne. With a grace that suggests some rare variety of benevolence, she has borne my presence for over sixty years. It is an achievement as inexplicable as it is appreciated.
