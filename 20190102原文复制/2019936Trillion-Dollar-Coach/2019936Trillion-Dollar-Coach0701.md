*A 2006 paper by Peter Frost, Jane Dutton, Sally Maitlis, Jacoba Lilius, Jason Kanov, and Monica Worline contains a compendium of research over the past century confirming the high value of compassion in the workplace and organizations.

*Search「Apple 1984 commercial」on your favorite search engine to see the ad.

*John is one of the more successful VCs in Silicon Valley, having led Kleiner Perkins’s investments in companies such as Google, Amazon, Netscape, Sun, Intuit, and Compaq.

*Bill stepped down as Intuit CEO in July 1998, then returned to the position in September 1999, when his replacement, Bill Harris, decided to resign. Bill stayed on as CEO until early 2000.

*Technically, Steve was the「interim CEO」of Apple from 1997 until January 2000, when he dropped「interim」from his title.

*Bill and Roberta divorced in 2009. He married Eileen Bocci in 2015.

*A hagiography is a biography that idealizes the subject. Jonathan and Alan had to look it up when Eric told them that was not what we were going to write.

*A 2010 study from Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia, includes several failure modes for managers acting as coaches, including not taking enough time, believing that people can’t be developed, and a perception that coaching isn’t aligned with bottom-line results.

*There are numerous studies that report favorable effects of profanity in the workplace: it’s good for, among other things, stress relief, honesty, integrity, and creativity. But before you go cussing up a blue streak, you should also know that other studies show that purveyors of profanity are generally judged to be less trustworthy and not as intelligent. Plus, your mom still disapproves.

*If not before the first company! As Peter Drucker astutely pointed out, the greatest manager of all time was probably「the fellow who managed the building of the first pyramid in Egypt some 4,500 years ago.」

*After Donna left Claris, she became CEO of Palm, makers of the PalmPilot. Later she was CEO of Handspring and lead trustee for Yale University, and she is currently the CEO of Numenta, a machine intelligence company.

*You can read more about Google’s「Project Oxygen」study in a December 2013 Harvard Business Review article by David Garvin,「How Google Sold Its Engineers on Management.」

*Bill Walsh was the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers for ten years, from 1979 through 1988. His teams won three Super Bowls.

*Perhaps some of Larry’s and Sergey’s adventurous spirit rubbed off on Alan. In October 2014, while on sabbatical from Google, he set the world record for highest-altitude「free-fall」jump when he leapt from a balloon 135,899 feet above the earth’s surface. Fourteen minutes later he landed safely, after reaching speeds of 822 mph, successfully completing what Jonathan likes to call「Alan’s failure to commit suicide.」

*Research on conflict resolution proves that having a standard process for managing conflict, whether it’s the rule of two or another approach, makes everyone happier and more effective.

*John came in as Tellme’s CEO in 2001. He left the company and Mike resumed the CEO role at the end of 2004.

*AT&T ended up deprioritizing its effort to build a competitive product and over time quadrupled its business with Tellme. In 2005, AT&T merged with SBC.

*A 2017 Harvard Business Review article on managing narcissists (which many aberrant geniuses may be), by Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries, includes the recommendation to minimize direct confrontation, which is what a lot of that「eighteen hours」consisted of.

*A year earlier, in 1975, a Kodak engineer, Steve Sasson, invented the world’s first digital camera. And thirty-seven years later, in 2012, the company declared bankruptcy, done in by the shift to digital.

*Innovative product teams should use problem intelligence as only a starting point. In a January–February 2017 article in Harvard Business Review, author and consultant Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg notes that many teams searching for solutions to problems fail to consider if they are solving the right problem. Wedell-Wedellsborg outlines seven practices to「re-frame」problems, which can lead to new and surprising solutions.

*Who manages whom is often a source of tension on boards. As a 2003 paper from the University of California, Berkeley, says,「The CEO has incentives to ‘capture’ the board, so as to ensure that he can keep his job and increase the other benefits he derives from being CEO. Directors have incentives to maintain their independence, to monitor the CEO, and to replace the CEO if his performance is poor.」

*More details about the study can be found in James Graham,「What Google Learned from Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team,」New York Times, February 25, 2016.

*A 2012 study demonstrates that tech companies have higher return on assets (ROA) when CEOs are servant leaders and lower ROA when CEOs are narcissists.

*Among other notable Google accomplishments, Salar helped create Google’s flagship advertising product, AdWords, and later led YouTube.

*Jesse was one of several people to use the present tense when talking about Bill, even though all of our interviews took place after Bill’s passing. Many said they still think about Bill and about how he would advise them whenever they are making decisions.

*For example, a 2011 study from the Ashridge Business School in the United Kingdom ranks「encouragement」as the third-most-appreciated quality in a coach, behind only listening and understanding.

*A 2014 research paper from Y. Joel Wong of Indiana University shows that「perceived trustworthiness of the encourager」is an important characteristic in differentiating effective encouragement from blind cheerleading.

*Early examples of companies with dual class share structures include Ford, the New York Times Company, and Berkshire Hathaway. Since 2004, structures with differing voting rights for different stock classes have become more commonplace, being adopted by Facebook, LinkedIn, and Snap, among others.

*This is the rare instance where available research does not bear out Bill’s principle. As James Pennebaker states in his book The Secret Life of Pronouns, use of「I」vs.「we」is not a good indicator of whether a person is a team player. Rather, it is an indicator of status. Lower-status people (for example, individual contributors in a company, first-year students in a university) use「I」more often, while higher-status people (executives, professors) use「we」more. We are not amused.

*Overindex is geek-speak for「pay a lot of attention to.」

*Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are stars on the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, who had just won their third title in four years when Sundar (a big Warriors fan) said this.

*A 1995 study by Daniel McAllister of Georgetown University shows that trust increases with the frequency of interaction between a manager and a peer.

*Three decades later, women still constitute a minority of executives in technology. A 2016 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission report states that 20 percent of high-tech execs are women, while a 2018 Entelo Women in Tech report pegs the number at 10 percent.

*P&L is profit and loss, having financial responsibility for a business unit or company. HR is human resources; PR is public relations.

*「Thank God for Webvan,」Bill loved to say.「They lost so much money they made people forget about GO.」Webvan raised more than $400 million from private investors and another $375 million from a 1999 IPO. It went bankrupt in 2001. GO lost about $75 million.

*Most research about delivering bad news shows that empathy is critical to doing it well. A 2000 paper for oncologists who have to bring bad news to patients notes that until「the emotion is cleared」(through empathy), it’s difficult to go on and discuss a plan.

*Including, in the late 1970s, a couple of local kids named Jonathan and Alan.

*The 49ers reached the playoffs sixteen times in those eighteen seasons. Lambeau Field is the home stadium of the Green Bay Packers, a frequent 49er rival.

*A 2001 paper by Fiona Lee and Larissa Z. Tiedens examines how these factors of interdependence and independence reinforce each other and notes that「power creates a subjective sense of separation and distinctiveness from others.」
