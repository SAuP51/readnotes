We have offered evidence that metaphors and metonymies are not random but instead form coherent systems in terms of which we conceptualize our experience. But it is easy to find apparent incoherences in everyday metaphorical expressions. We have not made a complete study of these, but those that we have looked at in detail have turned out not to be incoherent at all, though they appeared that way at first. Let us consider two examples.





An Apparent Metaphorical Contradiction









Charles Fillmore has observed (in conversation) that English appears to have two contradictory organizations of time. In the first, the future is in front and the past is behind:



In the weeks ahead of us ... (future)

That's all behind us now. (past)



In the second, the future is behind and the past is in front:



In the following weeks ... (future)

In the preceding weeks ... (past)



This appears to be a contradiction in the metaphorical organization of time. Moreover, the apparently contradictory metaphors can mix with no ill effect, as in



We're looking  ahead  to the  following  weeks.



Here it appears that  ahead  organizes the future in front, while  following  organizes it behind.

To see that there is, in fact, a coherence here, we first have to consider some facts about front-back organization. Some things, like people and cars, have inherent fronts and backs, but others, like trees, do not. A rock may receive a front-back organization under certain circumstances. Suppose you are looking at a medium-sized rock and there is a ball between you and the rock—say, a foot away from the rock. Then it is appropriate for you to say "The ball is in front of the rock." The rock has received a front-back orientation, as if it had a front that faced you. This is not universal. There are languages—Hausa, for instance— where the rock would receive the reverse orientation and you would say that the ball was behind the rock if it was between you and the rock.

Moving objects generally receive a front-back orientation so that the front is in the direction of motion (or in the canonical direction of motion, so that a car backing up retains its front). A spherical satellite, for example, that has no front while standing still, gets a front while in orbit by virtue of the direction in which it is moving.

Now, time in English is structured in terms of the  TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT  metaphor, with the future moving toward us:



The time will come when...

The time has long since gone when...

The time for action has arrived.



The proverb "Time flies" is an instance of the time is a moving object metaphor. Since we are facing toward the future, we get:



Coming up in the weeks ahead...

I look forward to the arrival of Christmas.

Before us is a great opportunity, and we don't want it to pass us by.



By virtue of the  TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT  metaphor, time receives a front-back orientation facing in the direction of motion, just as any moving object would. Thus the future isfacing toward us as it moves toward us, and we find expressions like:



I can't face the future.

The face of things to come...

Let's meet the future head-on.



Now, while expressions like  ahead of us, I look forward,  and  before us  orient times with respect to people, expressions like  precede and follow  orient times with respect to times. Thus we get:



Next week and the week following it.

but not:

The week following me ...



Since future times are facing toward us, the times following them are further in the future, and all future times follow the present. That is why the  weeks to follow  are the same as the  weeks ahead of us.

The point of this example is not merely to show that there is no contradiction but also to show all the subtle details that are involved: the time is a moving object metaphor, the front-back orientation given to time by virtue of its being a moving object, and the consistent application of words lik e follow, precede,  and  face  when applied to time on the basis of the metaphor. All of this consistent detailed metaphorical structure is part of our everyday literal language about time, so familiar that we would normally not notice it.





Coherence versus Consistency









We have shown that the  TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT  metaphor has an internal consistency. But there is another way in which we conceptualize the passing of time:





TIME IS STATIONARY AND WE MOVE THROUGH IT





As we go through the years,...

As we go further into the 1980s,...

We're approaching the end of the year.



What we have here are two subcases of time passes us: in one case, we are moving and time is standing still; in the other, time is moving and we are standing still. What is in common is relative motion with respect to us, with the future in front and the past behind. That is, they are two subcases of the same metaphor, as shown in the accompanying diagram.











This is another way of saying that they have a major common entailment. Both metaphors entail that, from our point of view, time goes past us from front to back.

Although the two metaphors are not consistent (that is, they form no single image), they nonetheless "fit together," by virtue of being subcategories of a major category and therefore sharing a major common entailment. There is a difference between metaphors that are  coherent  (that is, "fit together") with each other and those that are  consistent.  We have found that the connections between metaphors are more likely to involve coherence than consistency.

As another example, let us take another metaphor:





LOVE IS A JOURNEY





Look  how far we've come.

We're  at a crossroads.

We'll just have to  go our separate ways.

We can't  turn hack now.

I don't think this relationship is  going anywhere.

Where  are we?

We're  stuck.

It's been a  long, bumpy road.

This relationship is a  dead-end street.

We're just  spinning our wheels.

Our marriage is  on the rocks.

We've gotten  off the track.

This relationship is  foundering.



Here the basic metaphor is that of a journey, and there are various types of journeys that one can make: a car trip, a train trip, or a sea voyage.











Once again, there is no single consistent image that the journey metaphors all fit. What makes them  coherent  is that they are all journey metaphors, though they specify different means of travel. The same sort of thing occurs with the time is a moving object metaphor, where there are various ways in which something can move. Thus,  time flies, time creeps along, time speeds by.  In general, metaphorical concepts are defined not in terms of concrete images (flying, creeping, going down the road, etc.), but in terms of more general categories, like passing.

Some Further Examples







We have been claiming that metaphors partially structure our everyday concepts and that this structure is reflected in our literal language. Before we can get an overall picture of the philosophical implications of these claims, we need a few more examples. In each of the ones that follow we give a metaphor and a list of ordinary expressions that are special cases of the metaphor. The English expressions are of two sorts: simple literal expressions and idioms that fit the metaphor and are part of the normal everyday way of talking about the subject.



THEORIES (AND ARGUMENTS) ARE BUILDINGS





Is that the  foundation  for your theory? The theory needs more  support.  The argument is  shaky.  We need some more facts or the argument will  fall apart.  We need to  construct  a  strong  argument for that. I haven't figured out yet what the  form  of the argument will be. Here are some more facts to  shore up  the theory. We need to  buttress  the theory with  solid  arguments. The theory will  stand  or  fall  on the  strength  of that argument. The argument  collapsed.  They  exploded  his latest theory. We will show that theory to be without  foundation.  So far we have put together only  the framework  of the theory.





IDEAS ARE FOOD





What he said  left a bad taste in my mouth.  All this paper has in it are  raw facts, half-baked ideas, and warmed-over theories.  There are too many facts here for me to  digest  them all. I just can't  swallow  that claim. That argument  smells fishy.  Let me  stew  over that for a while. Now there's a theory you can really  sink your teeth into.  We need to let that idea  percolate  for a while. That's  food for thought.  He's a  voracious  reader. We don't need to  spoon-feed  our students. He  devoured  the book. Let's let that idea  simmer on the hack burner  for a while. This is the  meaty  part of the paper. Let that idea  jell  for a while. That idea has been  fermenting  for years.







With respect to life and death ideas are organisms, either people or plants.





IDEAS ARE PEOPLE





The theory of relativity  gave birth to  an enormous number of ideas in physics. He is the  father  of modern biology. Whose  brainchild  was that? Look at what his ideas have  spawned.  Those ideas  died off  in the Middle Ages. His ideas will  live on  forever. Cognitive psychology is still in its  infancy.  That's an idea that ought to be  resurrected.  Where'd you  dig up  that idea? He  breathed new life into  that idea.





IDEAS ARE PLANTS





His ideas have finally come to  fruition.  That idea  died on the vine.  That's a  budding  theory. It will take years for that idea to  come to full flower.  He views chemistry as a mere  offshoot  of physics. Mathematics has many  branches.  The  seeds  of his great ideas were  planted  in his youth. She has  a fertile  imagination. Here's an idea that I'd like to  plant  in your mind. He has a  barren  mind.





IDEAS ARE PRODUCTS





We're really  turning (churning, cranking, grinding) out  new ideas. We've  generated  a lot of ideas this week. He  produces  new ideas at an astounding rate. His  intellectual productivity  has decreased in recent years. We need to  take the rough edges off  that idea,  hone it down, smooth it out.  It's a rough idea; it needs to be  refined.





IDEAS ARE COMMODITIES





It's important how you  package  your ideas. He won't  buy  that. That idea just won't  sell.  There is always a  market  for good ideas. That's a  worthless  idea. He's been a source of  valuable  ideas. I wouldn't  give a plugged nickel for  that idea. Your ideas don't have a chance in the  intellectual marketplace.





IDEAS ARE RESOURCES





He  ran out of  ideas. Don't  waste  your thoughts on small projects. Let's  pool  our ideas. He's a  resourceful  man. We've  used up  all our ideas. That's a  useless  idea. That idea will  go a long way.





IDEAS ARE MONEY





Let me put in my  two cents' worth.  He's  rich  in ideas. That book is a  treasure trove  of ideas. He has a  wealth  of ideas.





IDEAS ARE CUTTING INSTRUMENTS





That's an  incisive  idea. That  cuts right to the heart of  the matter. That was a  cutting  remark. He's  sharp.  He has a  razor  wit. He has a  keen  mind. She  cut  his argument  to ribbons.





IDEAS ARE FASHIONS





That idea went  out of style  years ago. I hear sociobiology  is in  these days. Marxism is currently  fashionable  in western Europe. That idea is  old hat!  That's an  outdated  idea. What are the new  trends  in English criticism?  Old-fashioned  notions have no place in today' s society. He keeps  up-to-date  by reading the New York Review of Books. Berkeley is a center of  avant-garde  thought. Semiotics has become quite  chic.  The idea of revolution is no longer  in vogue  in the United States. The transformational grammar  craze  hit the United States in the mid-sixties and has just made it to Europe.





UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING; IDEAS ARE LIGHT-SOURCES; DISCOURSE IS A LIGHT-MEDIUM





I  see  what you're saying. It  looks  different from my  point of view.  What is your  outlook  on that? I  view  it differently. Now I've got the  whole picture.  Let me  point something out  to you. That's an  insightful  idea. That was a  brilliant  remark. The argument is  clear.  It was a  murky  discussion. Could you  elucidate  your remarks? It's a  transparent  argument. The discussion was  opaque.





LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE (ELECTROMAGNETIC, GRAVITATIONAL, etc.)





I could feel the  electricity  between us. There were  sparks.  I was  magnetically drawn  to her. They are uncontrollably  attracted  to each other. They  gravitated  to each other immediately. His whole life  revolves  around her. The  atmosphere  around them is always  charged.  There is incredible  energy  in their relationship. They lost their  momentum.





LOVE IS A PATIENT





This is a  sick  relationship. They have a  strong, healthy  marriage. The marriage is  dead —it can't be  revived.  Their marriage is  on the mend.  We're getting  hack on our feet.  Their relationship is  in really good shape.  They've got a  listless  marriage. Their marriage is  on its last legs.  It's a  tired  affair.





LOVE IS MADNESS





I'm  crazy  about her. She  drives me out of my mind.  He constantly  raves  about her. He's gone  mad  over her. I'm just  wild  about Harry. I'm  insane  about her.





LOVE IS MAGIC





She  cast her spell  over me. The  magic  is gone. I was  spellbound.  She had me  hypnotized.  He has me  in a trance.  I was  entranced  by him. I'm  charmed  by her. She is  bewitching.





LOVE IS WAR





He is known for his many rapid  conquests . She  fought for  him, but his mistress  won out.  He  fled from  her  advances.  She  pursued  him  relentlessly.  He is slowly  gaining ground  with her. He  won  her hand in marriage. He  overpowered  her. She is  besieged  by suitors. He has to  fend  them  off.  He  enlisted the aid  of her friends. He  made an ally  of her mother. Theirs is a  misalliance  if I've ever seen one.





WEALTH IS A HIDDEN OBJECT





He's  seeking  his fortune. He's flaunting his  new-found  wealth. He's a  fortune-hunter.  She's  a gold-digger.  He  lost  his fortune. He's  searching for  wealth.





SIGNIFICANT IS BIG





He's a  big  man in the garment industry. He's a  giant  among writers. That's the  biggest  idea to hit advertising in years. He's  head and shoulders above  everyone in the industry. It was only a  small  crime. That was only a  little  white lie. I was astounded at the  enormity  of the crime. That was one of the  greatest  moments in World Series history. His accomplishments  tower over  those of  lesser  men.





SEEING IS TOUCHING; EYES ARE LIMBS





I can't  take  my eyes  off  her. He sits with his eyes  glued to  the TV. Her eyes  picked out  every detail of the pattern. Their eyes  met.  She never  moves  her eyes  from  his face.  She ran  her eyes  over  everything in the room. He wants everything  within reach of  his eyes.





THE EYES ARE CONTAINERS FOR THE EMOTIONS





I could see the fear  in  his eyes. His eyes  were filled  with anger. There was passion  in  her eyes. His eyes  displayed  his compassion. She couldn't  get  the fear  out  of her eyes. Love  showed in  his eyes. Her eyes  welled  with emotion.





EMOTIONAL EFFECT IS PHYSICAL CONTACT





His mother's death  hit  him  hard.  That idea  bowled me over.  She's a  knockout.  I was  struck  by his sincerity. That really  made an impression  on me. He  made his mark on  the world. I was  touched  by his remark. That  blew me away.





PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATES ARE ENTITIES WITHIN A PERSON





He has a pain m his shoulder. Don't  give  me the flu. My cold has  gone from my head to my chest.  His pains  went away.  His depression  returned.  Hot tea and honey will  get rid of  your cough. He could barely  contain  his joy. The smile  left  his face.  Wipe  that sneer  off  your face, private! His fears  keep coming back.  I've got to  shake off  this depression—it keeps  hanging on.  If you've got a cold, drinking lots of tea will  flush it out  of your system. There isn't a  trace  of cowardice  in  him. He hasn't got  an honest bone in his body.





VITALITY IS SUBSTANCE





She's  brimming  with vim and vigor. She's  overflowing  with vitality. He's  devoid  of energy. I don't  have  any energy  left  at the end of the day. I'm  drained.  That  took a lot out of  me.





LIFE IS A CONTAINER





I've had a  full  life. Life is  empty  for him. There's  not much left  for him  in  life. Her life is  crammed  with activities.  Get the most out of  life. His life  contained  a great deal of sorrow. Live your life  to the fullest.





LIF IS A GAMBLING GAME





I'll  take my chances.  The  odds are against me.  I've got an  ace up my sleeve.  He's  holding all the aces.  It's a  toss-up.  If you  play your cards right,  you can do it. He  won big.  He's a real  loser.  Where is he when the  chips are down?  That's my  ace in the hole.  He's  bluffing.  The president is  playing it close to his vest.  Let's  up the ante.  Maybe we need to  sweeten the pot.  I think we should  stand pat.  That's  the luck of the draw.  Those are  high stakes.





In this last group of examples we have a collection of what are called "speech formulas," or "fixed-form expressions," or "phrasal lexical items." These function in many ways like single words, and the language has thousands of them. In the examples given, a set of such phrasal lexical items is coherently structured by a single metaphorical concept. Although each of them is an instance of the life is a gambling game metaphor, they are typically used to speak of life, not of gambling situations. They are normal ways of talking about life situations, just as using the word "construct" is a normal way of talking about theories. It is in this sense that we include them in what we have called literal expressions structured by metaphorical concepts. If you say "The odds are against us" or "We'll have to take our chances," you would not be viewed as speaking metaphorically but as using the normal everyday language appropriate to the situation. Nevertheless, your way of talking about, conceiving, and even experiencing your situation would be metaphorically structured.









11















The Partial Nature of Metaphorical Structuring







Up to this point we have described the systematic character of metaphorically defined concepts. Such concepts are understood in terms of a number of different metaphors (e.g.,  TIME IS MONEY, TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT , etc.). The metaphorical structuring of concepts is necessarily partial and is reflected in the lexicon of the language, including the phrasal lexicon, which contains fixed-form expressions such as "to be without foundation." Because concepts are metaphorically structured in a systematic way, e.g.,  THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS , it is possible for us to use expressions  (construct, foundation)  from one domain  (BUILDINGS)  to talk about corresponding concepts in the metaphorically defined domain  (THEORIES) . What  foundation , for example, means in the metaphorically defined domain (theory) will depend on the details of how the metaphorical concept  THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS  is used to structure the concept  THEORY .

The parts of the concept  BUILDING  that are used to structure the concept  THEORY  are the foundation and the outer shell. The roof, internal rooms, staircases, and hallways are parts of a building not used as part of the concept  THEORY . Thus the metaphor  THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS  has a "used" part (foundation and outer shell) and an "unused" part (rooms, staircases, etc.). Expressions such as  construct and foundation  are instances of the used part of such a metaphorical concept and are part of our ordinary literal language about theories.

But what of the linguistic expressions that reflect the"unused" part of a metaphor like  THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS ? Here are four examples:



His theory has thousands of little rooms and long, winding corridors.

His theories are Bauhaus in their pseudofunctional simplicity.

He prefers massive Gothic theories covered with gargoyles.

Complex theories usually have problems with the plumbing.



These sentences fall outside the domain of normal literal language and are part of what is usually called "figurative" or "imaginative" language. Thus, literal expressions ("He has constructed a theory") and imaginative expressions ("His theory is covered with gargoyles") can be instances of the same general metaphor ( THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS ).

Here we can distinguish three different subspecies of imaginative (or nonliteral) metaphor:



Extensions of the used part of a metaphor, e.g., "These facts are the bricks and mortar of my theory." Here the outer shell of the building is referred to, whereas the  THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS  metaphor stops short of mentioning the materials used.



Instances of the unused part of the literal metaphor, e.g., "His theory has thousands of little rooms and long, winding corridors."



Instances of novel metaphor, that is, a metaphor not used to structure part of our normal conceptual system but as a new way of thinking about something, e.g., "Classical theories are patriarchs who father many children, most of whom fight incessantly." Each of these subspecies lies outside the  used  part of a metaphorical concept that structures our normal conceptual system.



We note in passing that all of the linguistic expressions we have given to characterize general metaphorical concepts are figurative. Examples are  TIME IS MONEY ,TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT, CONTROL IS UP IDEAS ARE FOOD, THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS , etc None of these is literal. Thisis a consequence of the fact that only  part  of them is used to structure our normal concepts. Since they necessarily contain parts that are not used in our normal concepts, they go beyond the realm of the literal.

Each of the metaphorical expressions we have talked about so far (e.g., the time  will come;  we  construct  a theory,  attack  an idea) is used within a whole system of metaphorical concepts—concepts that we constantly use in living and thinking. These expressions, like all other words and phrasal lexical items in the language, are fixed by convention. In addition to these cases, which are parts of whole metaphorical systems, there are idiosyncratic metaphorical expressions that stand alone and are not used systematically in our language or thought. These are well-known expressions like the  foot  of the mountain, a  head  of cabbage, the  leg  of a table, etc. These expressions are isolated instances of metaphorical concepts, where there is only one instance of a used part (or maybe two or three). Thus the  foot  of the mountain is the only used part of the metaphor A  MOUNTAIN  I S A PERSON . In normal discourse we do not speak of the  head, shoulders,  or  trunk  of a mountain, though in special contexts it is possible to construct novel metaphorical expressions based on these unused parts. In fact, there is an aspect of the metaphor a mountain is a person in which mountain climbers will speak of the  shoulder  of a mountain (namely, a ridge near the top) and of  conquering, fighting,  and even  being killed by  a mountain. And there are cartoon conventions where mountains become animate and their peaks become heads. The point here is that there are metaphors, like  A MOUNTAIN IS A PERSON , that are marginal in our culture and our language; their used part may consist of only one conventionally fixed expression of the language, and they do not systematically interact with other metaphorical concepts because so little of them is used. This makes them relatively uninteresting for our purposes but not completely so, since they can be extended to their unused part in coining novel metaphoricalexpressions, making jokes, etc. And our ability to extend them to unused parts indicates that, however marginal they are, they do exist.

Examples like  the foot  of the mountain are idiosyncratic, unsystematic, and isolated. They do not interact with other metaphors, play no particularly interesting role in our conceptual system, and hence are not metaphors that we live by. The only signs of life they have is that they can be extended in subcultures and that their unused portions serve as the basis for (relatively uninteresting) novel metaphors. If any metaphorical expressions deserve to be called "dead," it is these, though they do have a bare spark of life, in that they are understood partly in terms of marginal metaphorical concepts like  A MOUNTAIN IS A PERSON .

It is important to distinguish these isolated and unsystematic cases from the systematic metaphorical expressions we have been discussing. Expressions like  wasting time, attacking positions, going our separate ways,  etc., are reflections of systematic metaphorical concepts that structure our actions and thoughts. They are "alive" in the most fundamental sense: they are metaphors we live by. The fact that they are conventionally fixed within the lexicon of English makes them no less alive.

How Is Our Conceptual System Grounded?







We claim that most of our normal conceptual system is metaphorically structured; that is, most concepts are partially understood in terms of other concepts. This raises an important question about the grounding of our conceptual system. Are there any concepts at all that are understood directly, without metaphor? If not, how can we understand anything at all?

The prime candidates for concepts that are understood directly are the simple spatial concepts, such as UP. Our spatial concept UP arises out of our spatial experience. We have bodies and we stand erect. Almost every movement we make involves a motor program that either changes our up-down orientation, maintains it, presupposes it, or takes it into account in some way. Our constant physical activity in the world, even when we sleep, makes an up-down orientation not merely relevant to our physical activity but centrally relevant. The centrality of up-down orientation in our motor programs and everyday functioning might make one think that there could be no alternative to this orientational concept. Objectively speaking, however, there are many possible frameworks for spatial orientation, including Cartesian coordinates, that don't in themselves have up-down orientation. Human spatial concepts, however, include  UP-DOWN, FRONT-BACK, IN-OUT ,  NEAR-FAR , etc. It is these that are relevant to our continual everyday bodily functioning, and this gives them priority over other possible structurings of space—for us. In other words, the structure of our spatial concepts emerges from our constant spatialexperience, that is, our interaction with the physical environment. Concepts that emerge in this way are concepts that we live by in the most fundamental way.

Thus UP is not understood purely in its own terms but emerges from the collection of constantly performed motor functions having to do with our erect position relative to the gravitational field we live in. Imagine a spherical being living outside any gravitational field, with no knowledge or imagination of any other kind of experience. What could up possibly mean to such a being? The answer to this question would depend, not only on the physiology of this spherical being, but also on its culture.

In other words, what we call "direct physical experience" is never merely a matter of having a body of a certain sort; rather,  every  experience takes place within a vast background of cultural presuppositions. It can be misleading, therefore, to speak of direct physical experience as though there were some core of immediate experience which we then "interpret" in terms of our conceptual system. Cultural assumptions, values, and attitudes are not a conceptual overlay which we may or may not place upon experience as we choose. It would be more correct to say that all experience is cultural through and through, that we experience our "world" in such a way that our culture is already present in the very experience itself.

However, even if we grant that every experience involves cultural presuppositions, we can still make the important distinction between experiences that are "more" physical, such as standing up, and those that are "more" cultural, such as participating in a wedding ceremony. When we speak of "physical" versus "cultural" experience in what follows, it is in this sense that we use the terms.

Some of the central concepts in terms of which our bodies function—UP-DOWN,  IN-OUT, FRONT-BACK, LIGHT-DARK, WARM-COLD, MALE-FEMALE , etc.—are more sharply delineated than others. While our emotional experience isas basic as our spatial and perceptual experience, our emotional experiences are much less sharply delineated in terms of what we do with our bodies. Although a sharply delineated conceptual structure for space emerges from our perceptual-motor functioning, no sharply defined conceptual structure for the emotions emerges from our emotional functioning alone. Since there are  systematic correlates  between our emotions (like happiness) and our sensory-motor experiences (like erect posture), these form the basis of orientational metaphorical concepts (such as  HAPPY IS  UP). Such metaphors allow us to conceptualize our emotions in more sharply defined terms and also to relate them to other concepts having to do with general well-being (e.g.,  HEALTH, LIFE, CONTROL , etc.). In this sense, we can speak of  emergent metaphors  and  emergent concepts.

For example, the concepts  OBJECT, SUBSTANCE , and  CONTAINER  emerge directly. We experience ourselves as entities, separate from the rest of the world—as containers with an inside and an outside. We also experience things external to us as entities—often also as containers with in-sides and outsides. We experience ourselves as being made up of substances—e.g., flesh and bone—and external objects as being made up of various kinds of substances— wood, stone, metal, etc. We experience many things, through sight and touch, as having distinct boundaries, and, when things have no distinct boundaries, we often project boundaries upon them—conceptualizing them as entities and often as containers (for example, forests, clearings, clouds, etc.).

As in the case of orientational metaphors, basic ontological metaphors are grounded by virtue of  systematic correlates within our experience . As we saw, for example, the metaphor  THE VISUAL FIELD IS A CONTAINER  is grounded in the correlation between what we see and a bounded physical space.  THE TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT  metaphor is based on the correlation between an object moving toward us and the time it takes to get to us. The same correlation is a basis for the  TIME IS A CONTAINER  metaphor (as in "He did it  in  ten minutes"), with the bounded space traversed by the object correlated with the time the object takes to traverse it. Events and actions are correlated with bounded time spans, and this makes them  CONTAINER OBJECTS .

Experience with physical objects provides the basis for metonymy. Metonymie concepts emerge from correlations in our experience between two physical entities (e.g.,  PART FOR WHOLE, OBJECT FOR USER ) or between a physical entity and something metaphorically conceptualized as a physical entity (e.g.,  THE PLACE FOR THE EVENT, THE INSTITUTION FOR THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE ).

Perhaps the most important thing to stress about grounding is the distinction between an experience and the way we conceptualize it. We are not claiming that physical experience is in any way more basic than other kinds of experience, whether emotional, mental, cultural, or whatever. All of these experiences may be just as basic as physical experiences. Rather, what we are claiming about grounding is that we typically conceptualize the nonphysical  in terms of  the physical—that is, we conceptualize the less clearly delineated in terms of the more clearly delineated. Consider the following examples:



Harry is in the kitchen.

Harry is in the Elks.

Harry is in love.



The sentences refer to three different domains of experience: spatial, social, and emotional. None of these has experiential priority over the others; they are all equally basic kinds of experience.

But with respect to conceptual structuring there is a difference. The concept IN of the first sentence emerges directly from spatial experience in a clearly delineated fashion. It is not an instance of a metaphorical concept. The other two sentences, however, are instances of metaphori-cal concepts. The second is an instance of the social groups are containers metaphor, in terms of which the concept of a social group is structured. This metaphor allows us to "get a handle on" the concept of a social group by means of a spatialization. The word "in" and the concept IN are the same in all three examples; we do not have three different concepts of IN or three homophonous words "in." We have one emergent concept IN, one word for it, and two metaphorical concepts that partially define social groups and emotional states. What these cases show is that it is possible to have equally basic kinds of experiences while having conceptualizations of them that are not equally basic.

The Grounding of Structural Metaphors
