## 0501. Metaphor and Cultural Coherence

The most fundamental values in a culture will be coherent with the metaphorical structure of the most fundamental concepts in the culture. As an example, let us consider some cultural values in our society that are coherent with our up-down spatialization metaphors and whose opposite s would not be.

"More is better" is coherent with more is up and good is up.

"Less is better" is not coherent with them.



"Bigger is better" is coherent with more is up and good is up. "Smaller is better" is not coherent with them.



"The future will be better" is coherent with the future is up and good is up. "The future will be worse" is not.



"There will be more in the future" is coherent with more is up and  THE FUTURE IS UP.



"Your status should be higher in the future" is coherent with  HIGH STATUS IS UP  and  THE FUTURE IS UP.



These are values deeply embedded in our culture. "The future will be better" is a statement of the concept of progress. "There will be more in the future" has as special cases the accumulation of goods and wage inflation. "Your status should be higher in the future" is a statement of careerism. These are coherent with our present spatialization metaphors; their opposites would not be. So it seems that our values are not independent but must form a coherent system with the metaphorical concepts we live by. We are not claiming that all cultural values coherent with a metaphorical system actually exist, only that those that do exist and are deeply entrenched are consistent with the metaphorical system.

The values listed above hold in our culture generally—all things being equal. But because things are usually not equal, there are often conflicts among these values and hence conflicts among the metaphors associated with them. To explain such conflicts among values (and their metaphors), we must find the different priorities given to these values and metaphors by the subculture that uses them. For instance, more is up seems always to have the highest priority since it has the clearest physical basis. The priority of more is up over good is up can be seen in examples like "Inflation is rising" and "The crime rate is going up." Assuming that inflation and the crime rate are bad, these sentences mean what they do because more is up always has top priority.

In general, which values are given priority is partly a matter of the subculture one lives in and partly a matter of personal values. The various subcultures of a mainstream culture share basic values but give them different priorities. For example, bigger is better may be in conflict with there will be more in the future when it comes to the question of whether to buy a big car now, with large time payments that will eat up future salary, or whether to buy a smaller, cheaper car. There are American subcultures where you buy the big car and don't worry about the future, and there are others where the future comes first and you buy the small car. There was a time (before inflation and the energy crisis) when owning a small car had a high status within the subculture where virtue is up and saving resources is virtuous took priority over bigger is better. Nowadays the number of small-car owners has gone up drastically because there is a large subculture where saving money is better has priority over bigger is better.

In addition to subcultures, there are groups whose defining characteristic is that they share certain important values that conflict with those of the mainstream culture. But in less obvious ways they preserve other mainstream values. Take monastic orders like the Trappists. There less is better and  SMALLER IS BETTER  are true with respect to material possessions, which are viewed as hindering what is important, namely, serving God. The Trappists share the mainstream value virtue is up, though they give it the highest priority and a very different definition, more is still better, though it applies to virtue; and status is still up, though it is not of this world but of a higher one, the Kingdom of God. Moreover, the future will be better is true in terms of spiritual growth (up) and, ultimately, salvation (really up). This is typical of groups that are out of the mainstream culture. Virtue, goodness, and status may be radically redefined, but they are still up. It is still better to have more of what is important, the future will be better with respect to what is important, and so on. Relative to what is important for a monastic group, the value system is both internally coherent and, with respect to what is important for the group, coherent with the major orientational metaphors of the mainstream culture.

Individuals, like groups, vary in their priorities and in the ways they define what is good or virtuous to them. In this sense, they are subgroups of one. Relative to what is important for them, their individual value systems are coherent with the major orientational metaphors of the mainstream culture.

Not all cultures give the priorities we do to up-down orientation. There are cultures where balance or centrality plays a much more important role than it does in our culture. Or consider the nonspatial orientation active-passive. For us  ACTIVE ISUP AND PASIIVE IS DOWN  in most matters. But there are cultures where passivity is valued more than activity. In general the major orientations up-down, in-out, central-peripheral, active-passive, etc., seem to cut across all cultures, but which concepts are oriented which way and which orientations are most important vary from culture to culture.











Ontological Metaphors









Entity and Substance Metaphors





Spatial orientations like up-down, front-back, on-off, center-periphery, and near-far provide an extraordinarily rich basis for understanding concepts in orientational terms. But one can do only so much with orientation. Our experience of physical objects and substances provides a further basis for understanding—one that goes beyond mere orientation. Understanding our experiences in terms of objects and substances allows us to pick out parts of our experience and treat them as discrete entities or substances of a uniform kind. Once we can identify our experiences as entities or substances, we can refer to them, categorize them, group them, and quantify them—and, by this means, reason about them.

When things are not clearly discrete or bounded, we still categorize them as such, e.g., mountains, street corners, hedges, etc. Such ways of viewing physical phenomena are needed to satisfy certain purposes that we have: locating mountains, meeting at street corners, trimming hedges. Human purposes typically require us to impose artificial boundaries that make physical phenomena discrete just as we are: entities bounded by a surface.

Just as the basic experiences of human spatial orientations give rise to orientational metaphors, so our experiences with physical objects (especially our own bodies) provide the basis for an extraordinarily wide variety of ontological metaphors, that is, ways of viewing events, activities, emotions, ideas, etc., as entities and substances.

Ontological metaphors  serve various purposes, and the various kinds of metaphors there are reflect the kinds of purposes served. Take the experience of rising prices, which can be metaphorically viewed as an entity via the noun  inflation.  This gives us a way of referring to the experience:



INFLATION IS AN ENTITY







Inflation is lowering  our standard of living.

If there's much  more inflation,   we'll never survive.

We need to  combat inflation.

Inflation is backing us  into a corner.

Inflation is taking its toll  at the checkout counter and the gas pump.

Buying land is the best way of  dealing with inflation.



Inflation makes me sick.





In these cases, viewing inflation as an entity allows us to refer to it, quantify it, identify a particular aspect of it, see it as a cause, act with respect to it, and perhaps even believe that we understand it. Ontological metaphors like this are necessary for even attempting to deal rationally with our experiences.

The range of ontological metaphors that we use for such purposes is enormous. The following list gives some idea of the kinds of purposes, along with representative examples of ontological metaphors that serve them.





Referring



My  fear of insects  is driving my wife crazy.

That was a  beautiful catch.

We are working toward  peace.

The  middle class  is a  powerful silent force  in  American politics.

The  honor of our country  is at stake in this war.





Quantifying



It will take  a lot of patience  to finish this book.

There is  so much hatred  in the world.

DuPont has  a lot of political power  in Delaware.

You've got  too much hostility  in you.

Pete Rose has  a lot of hustle and baseball know-how.





Identifying Aspects



The  ugly side of his personality  comes out under pressure.

The  brutality of war  dehumanizes us all.

I can't keep up with the  pace of modern life.

His  emotional health  has deteriorated recently.

We never got to feel the  thrill of victory  in Vietnam.





Identifying Causes



The  pressure of his responsibilities  caused his breakdown.

He did it out of  anger.

Our influence in the world has declined because of our  lack of moral fiber.

Internal dissension  cost them the pennant.





Setting Goals and Motivating Actions



He went to New York to  seek fame and fortune.

Here's what you have to do to  insure financial security.

I'm changing my way of life so that I can  find true happiness.

The FBI will act quickly in the face of a  threat to national security.

She saw getting married as the  solution to her problems.



As in the case of orientational metaphors, most of these expressions are not noticed as being metaphorical. One reason for this is that ontological metaphors, like orientational metaphors, serve a very limited range of purposes— referring, quantifying, etc. Merely viewing a nonphysical thing as an entity or substance does not allow us to comprehend very much about it. But ontological metaphors may be further elaborated. Here are two examples of how the ontological metaphor the mind is an entity is elaborated in our culture.



THE MIND IS A MACHINE





We're still trying to  grind out  the solution to this equation.

My mind just isn't  operating  today.

Boy, the  wheels are turning  now!

I'm  a little rusty  today.

We've been working on this problem all day and now we're  running out of steam.





THE MIND IS A BRITTLE OBJECT





Her ego is very  fragile.

You have to  handle him with care  since his wife's death.

He  broke  under cross-examination.

She is  easily crushed.

The experience  shattered  him.

I'm  going to pieces.

His mind  snapped.



These metaphors specify different kinds of objects. They give us different metaphorical models for what the mind is and thereby allow us to focus on different aspects of mental experience. The  MACHINE  metaphor gives us a conception of the mind as having an on-off state, a level of efficiency, a productive capacity, an internal mechanism, a source of energy, and an operating condition. The brittle object metaphor is not nearly as rich. It allows us to talk only about psychological strength. However, there is a range of mental experience that can be conceived of in terms of either metaphor. The examples we have in mind are these:



He broke down, ( THE MIND IS A MACHINE )

He cracked up. (THE MIND IS A BRITTLE OBJECT)



But these two metaphors do not focus on  exactly  the same aspect of mental experience. When a machine breaks down, it simply ceases to function. When a brittle object shatters, its pieces go flying, with possibly dangerous consequences. Thus, for example, when someone goes crazy and becomes wild or violent, it would be appropriate to say "He cracked up." On the other hand, if someone becomes lethargic and unable to function for psychological reasons, we would be more likely to say "He broke down."

Ontological metaphors like these are so natural and so pervasive in our thought that they are usually taken as self-evident, direct descriptions of mental phenomena. The fact that they are metaphorical never occurs to most of us. We take statements like "He cracked under pressure" as being directly true or false. This expression was in fact used by various journalists to explain why Dan White brought his gun to the San Francisco City Hall and shot and killed Mayor George Moscone. Explanations of this sort seem perfectly natural to most of us. The reason is that metaphors like  THE MIND IS A BRITTLE OBJECT  are an integral part of the model of the mind that we have in this culture; it is the model most of us think and operate in terms of.





Container Metaphors









Land Areas











We are physical beings, bounded and set off from the rest of the world by the surface of our skins, and we experience the rest of the world as outside us. Each of us is a container, with a bounding surface and an in-out orientation. We project our own in-out orientation onto other physical objects that are bounded by surfaces. Thus we also view them as containers with an inside and an outside. Rooms and houses are obvious containers. Moving from room to room is moving from one container to another, that is, moving  out of  one room and  into  another. We even give solid objects this orientation, as when we break a rock open to see what's inside it. We impose this orientation on our natural environment as well. A clearing in the woods is seen as having a bounding surface, and we can view ourselves as being  in  the clearing or  out of  the clearing,   in  the woods or  out of  the woods. A clearing in the woods has something we can perceive as a natural boundary—the fuzzy area where the trees more or less stop and the clearing more or less begins. But even where there is no natural physical boundary that can be viewed as defining a container, we impose boundaries—marking off territory so that it has an inside and a bounding surface—whether a wall, a fence, or an abstract line or plane. There are few human instincts more basic than territoriality. And such defining of a territory, putting a boundary around it, is an act of quantification. Bounded objects, whether human beings, rocks, or land areas, have sizes. This allows them to be quantified in terms of the amount of substance they contain. Kansas, for example, is a bounded area— a  CONTAINER —which is why we can say, "There's a lot of land  in  Kansas."

Substances can themselves be viewed as containers. Take a tub of water, for example. When you get into the tub, you get into the water. Both the tub and the water are viewed as containers, but of different sorts. The tub is a  CONTAINER OBJECT , while the water is a  CONTAINER SUBSTANCE.





The Visual Field







We conceptualize our visual field as a container and conceptualize what we see as being inside it. Even the term "visual field"  suggests this. The metaphor is a natural one that emerges from the fact that, when you look at some territory (land, floor space, etc.), your field of vision defines a boundary of the territory, namely, the part that you can see. Given that a bounded physical  SPACE IS CONTAINER  and that our field of vision correlates with that bounded physical space, the metaphorical concept  VISUAL FIELDS ARE CONTAINER  emerges naturally. Thus we can say:



The ship is  coming into  view.

I  have  him  in  sight.

I can't see him—the tree is  in  the way.

He's  out of  sight now.

That's  in  the  center of  my  field  of vision.

There's  nothing in  sight.

I can't get  all  of the ships  in  sight at once.





Events, Actions, Activities, and States







We use ontological metaphors to comprehend events, actions, activities, and states. Events and actions are conceptualized metaphorically as objects, activities as substances, states as containers. A race, for example, is an event, which is viewed as a discrete entity. The race exists in space and time, and it has well-defined boundaries. Hence we view it as a  CONTAINER OBJECT , having in it participants (which are objects), events like the start and finish (which are metaphorical objects), and the activity of running (which is a metaphorical substance). Thus we can say of a race:



Are you  in  the race on Sunday? (race as  CONTAINER OBJECT)

Are you  going to  the race? (race as  OBJECT )

Did you  see  the race? (race as  OBJECT )

The  finish  of the race was really exciting, (finish as event

OBJECT  within  CONTAINER OBJECT)



There was  a lot of good running in  the race, (running as a

SUBSTANCE   in a  CONTAINER ) I couldn't do  much sprinting  until the end. (sprinting as  SUBSTANCE )

Halfway into  the race, I ran out of energy, (race as  CONTAINER OBJECT )

He's  out of  the race now. (race as  CONTAINER OBJECT )





Activities in general are viewed metaphorically as  SUBSTANCES  and therefore as  CONTAINERS :



In  washing the window, I splashed water all over the floor.

How did Jerry  get out of  washing the windows?

Outside of  washing the windows, what else did you do?

How much  window-washing did you do?

How did you  get into  window-washing as a profession?

He's  immersed in  washing the windows right now.



Thus, activities are viewed as containers for the actions and other activities that make them up. They are also viewed as containers for the energy and materials required for them and for their by-products, which may be viewed as  in  them or as  emerging from  them:



I  put a lot of energy into  washing the windows.

I  get a lot of satisfaction out of  washing windows.

There is a lot of satisfaction in  washing windows.



Various kinds of states may also be conceptualized as containers. Thus we have examples like these:



He' s  in  love.

We're  out of  trouble now.

He's  coming out of  the coma.

I'm  slowly getting into  shape.

He  entered  a state of euphoria.

He fell into  a depression.

He finally  emerged from  the catatonic state he had been  in  since the end of finals week.











Personification







Perhaps the most obvious ontological metaphors are those where the physical object is further specified as being a person. This allows us to comprehend a wide variety of experiences with nonhuman entities in terms of human motivations, characteristics, and activities. Here are some examples:



His  theory explained  to me the behavior of chickens raised in factories.

This  fact argues  against the standard theories.

Life has cheated  me.

Inflation is eating up  our profits.

His  religion tells  him that he cannot drink fine French wines.

The  Michelson-Morley experiment gave birth to  a new physical theory.

Cancer  finally  caught up with  him.



In each of these cases we are seeing something nonhuman as human. But personification is not a single unified general process. Each personification differs in terms of the aspects of people that are picked out. Consider these examples.



Inflation  has attacked  the foundation of our economy.

Inflation  has pinned  us  to the wall.

Our biggest  enemy  right now  is  inflation.

The dollar  has been destroyed  by inflation.

Inflation  has robbed  me of my savings.

Inflation  has outwitted  the best economic minds in the country.

Inflation  has given birth  to a money-minded generation.



Here inflation is personified, but the metaphor is not merely  INFLATION IS A PERSON . It is much more specific, namely,  INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY . It not only gives us a very specific way of thinking about inflation but also a way of acting toward it. We think of inflation as an adversary that can attack us, hurt us, steal from us, even destroy us. THE INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY THE  INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY  metaphor therefore gives rise to and justifies political and economic actions on the part of our government: declaring war on inflation, setting targets, calling for sacrifices, installing a new chain of command, etc.

The point here is that personification is a general category that covers a very wide range of metaphors, each picking out different aspects of a person or ways of looking at a person. What they all have in common is that they are extensions of ontological metaphors and that they allow us to make sense of phenomena in the world in human terms—terms that we can understand on the basis of our own motivations, goals, actions, and characteristics. Viewing something as abstract as inflation in human terms has an explanatory power of the only sort that makes sense to most people. When we are suffering substantial economic losses due to complex economic and political factors that no one really understands,  INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY  metaphor at least gives us a coherent account of why we're suffering these losses.











Metonymy







In the cases of personification that we have looked at we are imputing human qualities to things that are not human— theories, diseases, inflation, etc. In such cases there are no actual human beings referred to. When we say "Inflation robbed me of my savings," we are not using the term "inflation" to refer to a person. Cases like this must be distinguished from cases like



The  ham sandwich  is waiting for his check.



where the expression "the ham sandwich" is being used to refer to an actual person, the person who ordered the ham sandwich. Such cases are not instances of personification metaphors, since we do not understand "the ham sandwich" by imputing human qualities to it. Instead, we are using one entity to refer to another that is related to it. This is a case of what we will call  metonymy.  Here are some further examples:



He likes to read the  Marquis de Sade.  (= the writings of the marquis)

He's in  dance.  (= the dancing profession)

Acrylic  has taken over the art world. (= the use of acrylic paint)

The  Times  hasn't arrived at the press conference yet. (= the reporter from the  Times)

Mrs. Grundy frowns on  blue jeans.  (= the wearing of blue jeans)

New windshield wipers  will satisfy him. (= the state of having new wipers)

We are including as a special case of metonymy what traditional rhetoricians have called  synecdoche , where the part stands for the whole, as in the following.





THE PART FOR THE WHOLE





The  automobile  is clogging our highways. (= the collection of automobiles)

We need a couple of  strong bodies  for our team. (= strong people)

There are a lot of  good heads  in the university. (= intelligent people)

I've got a new  set of wheels.  (= car, motorcycle, etc.)

We need some  new blood  in the organization. (= new people)



In these cases, as in the other cases of metonymy, one entity is being used to refer to another. Metaphor and metonymy are different  kinds  of processes. Metaphor is principally a way of conceiving of one thing in terms of another, and its primary function is understanding. Metonymy, on the other hand, has primarily a referential function, that is, it allows us to use one entity to  stand for  another. But metonymy is not merely a referential device. It also serves the function of providing understanding. For example, in the case of the metonymy the part for the whole there are many parts that can stand for the whole. Which part we pick out determines which aspect of the whole we are focusing on. When we say that we need some  good heads  on the project, we are using "good heads" to refer to "intelligent people." The point is not just to use a part (head) to stand for a whole (person) but rather to pick out a particular characteristic of the person, namely, intelligence, which is associated with the head. The same is true of other kinds of metonymies. When we say "The  Times  hasn't arrived at the press conference yet," we are using "The  Times " not merely to refer to some reporter or other but also to suggest the importance of the institution the reporter represents. So "The  Times  has not yet arrived for the press conference" means something different from "Steve Roberts has not yet arrived for the press conference," even though Steve Roberts may be the  Times  reporter in question.

Thus metonymy serves some of the same purposes that metaphor does, and in somewhat the same way, but it allows us to focus more specifically on certain aspects of what is being referred to. It is also like metaphor in that it is not just a poetic or rhetorical device. Nor is it just a matter of language. Metonymic concepts (like the part for the whole) are part of the ordinary, everyday way we think and act as well as talk.

For example, we have in our conceptual system a special case of the metonymy the part for the whole, namely, the face for the person. For example:



She's just a  pretty face.

There are an  awful lot of faces  out there in the audience.

We need some  new faces  around here.



This metonymy functions actively in our culture. The tradition of portraits, in both painting and photography, is based on it. If you ask me to show you a picture of my son and I show you a picture of his face, you will be satisfied. You will consider yourself to have seen a picture of him. But if I show you a picture of his body without his face, you will consider it strange and will not be satisfied. You might even ask, "But what does he look like?" Thus the metonymy the face for the person is not merely a matter of language. In our culture we look at a person's face—rather than his posture or his movements—to get our basic information about what the person is like. We function in terms of a metonymy when we perceive the person in terms of his face and act on those perceptions.

Like metaphors, metonymies are not random or arbitrary occurrences, to be treated as isolated instances. Metonymie concepts are also systematic, as can be seen in the following representative examples that exist in our culture.





THE PART FOR THE WHOLE





Get  your butt  over here!

We don't hire  longhairs.

The Giants need a  stronger arm  in right field.

I've got a new  four-on-the-floor V-8.





PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT





I'll have a  Löwenbräu.

He bought a  Ford.

He's got a  Picasso  in his den.

I hate to read  Heidegger.





OBJECT USED FOR USER





The  sax  has the flu today.

The  BLT  is a lousy tipper.

The  gun  he hired wanted fifty grand.

We need a better  glove  at third base.

The  buses  are on strike.





CONTROLLER FOR CONTROLLED





Nixon  bombed Hanoi.

Ozawa  gave a terrible concert last night.

Napoleon  lost at Waterloo.

Casey Stengel  won a lot of pennants.

A Mercedes rear-ended  me.





INSTITUTION FOR PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE





Exxon  has raised its prices again.

You'll never get the  university  to agree to that.

The  Army  wants to reinstitute the draft.

The  Senate  thinks abortion is immoral.

I don't approve of the  government's  actions.





THE PLACE FOR THE INSTITUTION





The  White House  isn't saying anything.

Washington  is insensitive to the needs of the people.

The  Kremlin  threatened to boycott the next round of SALT talks.

Paris  is introducing longer skirts this season.

Hollywood  isn't what it used to be.

Wall Street  is in a panic.





THE PLACE FOR THE EVENT





Let's not let Thailand become another  Vietnam.

Remember  the Alamo.

Pearl Harbor  still has an effect on our foreign policy.

Watergate  changed our politics.

It's been  Grand Central Station  here all day.



Metonymie concepts like these are systematic in the same way that metaphoric concepts are. The sentences given above are not random. They are instances of certain general métonymie concepts in terms of which we organize our thoughts and actions. Metonymie concepts allow us to conceptualize one thing by means of its relation to something else. When we think of  a Picasso,  we are not just thinking of a work of art alone, in and of itself. We think of it in terms of its relation to the artist, that is, his conception of art, his technique, his role in art history, etc. We act with reverence toward  a Picasso,  even a sketch he made as a teen-ager, because of its relation to the artist. This is a way in which the producer for product metonymy affects both our thought and our action. Similarly, when a waitress says "The ham sandwich wants his check," she is not interested in the person as a person but only as a customer, which is why the use of such a sentence is dehumanizing. Nixon himself may not have dropped the bombs on Hanoi, but via the controller for controlled metonymy we not only say "Nixon bombed Hanoi" but also think of him as doing the bombing and hold him responsible for it. Again this is possible because of the nature of the métonymie relationship in the controller for controlled metonymy, where responsibility is what is focused on.

Thus, like metaphors, métonymie concepts structure not just our language but our thoughts, attitudes, and actions. And, like metaphoric concepts, métonymie concepts are grounded in our experience. In fact, the grounding of métonymie concepts is in general more obvious than is the case with metaphoric concepts, since it usually involves direct physical or causal associations. The part for whole metonymy, for example, emerges from our experiences with the way parts in general are related to wholes. producer for product is based on the causal (and typically physical) relationship between a producer and his product, the place for the event is grounded in our experience with the physical location of events. And so on.

Cultural and religious symbolism are special cases of metonymy. Within Christianity, for example, there is the metonymy dove for holy spirit. As is typical with metonymies, this symbolism is not arbitrary. It is grounded in the conception of the dove in Western culture and the conception of the Holy Spirit in Christian theology. There is a reason why the dove is the symbol of the Holy Spirit and not, say, the chicken, the vulture, or the ostrich. The dove is conceived of as beautiful, friendly, gentle, and, above all, peaceful. As a bird, its natural habitat is the sky, which metonymically stands for heaven, the natural habitat of the Holy Spirit. The dove is a bird that flies gracefully, glides silently, and is typically seen coming out of the sky and landing among people.

The conceptual systems of cultures and religions are metaphorical in nature. Symbolic metonymies are critical links between everyday experience and the coherent metaphorical systems that characterize religions and cultures. Symbolic metonymies that are grounded in our physical experience provide an essential means of comprehending religious and cultural concepts.











Challenges to Metaphorical Coherence
