The metaphors we have discussed so far are  conventional  metaphors, that is, metaphors that structure the ordinary conceptual system of our culture, which is reflected in our everyday language. We would now like to turn to metaphors that are outside our conventional conceptual system, metaphors that are imaginative and creative. Such metaphors are capable of giving us a new understanding of our experience. Thus, they can give new meaning to our pasts, to our daily activity, and to what we know and believe.

To see how this is possible, let us consider the new metaphor LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART. This is a metaphor that we personally find particularly forceful, insightful, and appropriate, given our experiences as members of our generation and our culture. The reason is that it makes our experiences of love coherent—it makes sense of them. We would like to suggest that new metaphors make sense of our experience in the same way conventional metaphors do: they provide coherent structure, highlighting some things and hiding others.

Like conventional metaphors, new metaphors have entailments, which may include other metaphors and literal statements as well. For example, the entailments of LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART arise from our beliefs about, and experiences of, what it means for something to be a collaborative work of art. Our personal views of work and art give rise to at least the following entailments for this metaphor:





Love is work.





Love is active.





Love requires cooperation.





Love requires dedication.





Love requires compromise.





Love requires a discipline.





Love involves shared responsibility.





Love requires patience.





Love requires shared values and goals.





Love demands sacrifice.





Love regularly brings frustration.





Love requires instinctive communication.





Love is an aesthetic experience.





Love is primarily valued for its own sake.





Love involves creativity.





Love requires a shared aesthetic.





Love cannot be achieved by formula.





Love is unique in each instance.





Love is an expression of who you are.





Love creates a reality.





Love reflects how you see the world.





Love requires the greatest honesty.





Love may be transient or permanent.





Love needs funding.





Love yields a shared aesthetic satisfaction from your joint efforts.





Some of these entailments are metaphorical (e.g., "Love is an aesthetic experience"); others are not (e.g., "Love involves shared responsibility"). Each of these entailments may itself have further entailments. The result is a large and coherent network of entailments, which may, on the whole, either fit or not fit our experiences of love. When the network does fit, the experiences form a coherent whole as instances of the metaphor. What we experience with such a metaphor is a kind of reverberation down through the network of entailments that awakens and connects our memories of our past love experiences and serves as a possible guide for future ones.

Let's be more specific about what we mean by "reverberations" in the metaphor  LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART.

First, the metaphor highlights certain features while suppressing others. For example, the active side of love is brought into the foreground through the notion of work both in COLLABORATIVE WORK and in WORK OF ART. This requires the masking of certain aspects of love that are viewed passively. In fact, the emotional aspects of love are almost never viewed as being under the lovers' active control in our conventional conceptual system. Even in the LOVE is a JOURNEY metaphor, the relationship is viewed as a vehicle that is not in the couple's active control, since it can be  off the tracks,  or  on the rocks,  or  not going anywhere . In the LOVE is MADNESS metaphor ("I'm crazy about her," "She's driving me wild"), there is the ultimate lack of control. In the LOVE IS HEALTH metaphor, where the relationship is a patient ("It's a healthy relationship," "It's a sick relationship," "Their relationship is reviving"), the passivity of health in this culture is transferred to love. Thus, in focusing on various aspects of activity (e.g., WORK, CREATION, PURSUING GOALS, BUILDING, HELPING, etc.), the metaphor provides an organization of important love experiences that our conventional conceptual system does not make available.

Second, the metaphor does not merely entail other concepts, like WORK or PURSUING SHARED GOALS, but it entails very specific  aspects  of these concepts. It is not just any work, like working on an automobile assembly line, for instance. It is work that requires that special balance of control and letting-go that is appropriate to artistic creation, since the goal that is pursued is not just any kind of goal but a joint aesthetic goal. And though the metaphor may suppress the out-of-control aspects of the LOVE IS MADNESS metaphor, it highlights another aspect, namely, the sense of almost demonic possession that lies behind our culture's connection between artistic genius and madness.

Third, because the metaphor highlights important love experiences and makes them coherent while it masks other love experiences, the metaphor gives love a new meaning. If those things entailed by the metaphor are for us the most important aspects of our love experiences, then the metaphor can acquire the status of a truth; for many people, love  is  a collaborative work of art. And because it is, the metaphor can have a feedback effect, guiding our future actions in accordance with the metaphor.

Fourth, metaphors can thus be appropriate because they sanction actions, justify inferences, and help us set goals. For example, certain actions, inferences, and goals are dictated by the LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART metaphor but not by the LOVE IS MADNESS metaphor. If love is madness, I do not concentrate on what I have to do to maintain it. But if it is work, then it requires activity, and if it is a work of art, it requires a very special  kind  of activity, and if it is collaborative, then it is even further restricted and specified.

Fifth, the meaning a metaphor will have for me will be partly culturally determined and partly tied to my past experiences. The cultural differences can be enormous because each of the concepts in the metaphor under discussion—ART,  WORK, COLLABORATION , and LOVE—can vary widely from culture to culture. Thus, LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART would mean very different things to a nineteenth-century European Romantic and an Eskimo living in Greenland at the same time. There will also be differences within a culture based on how individuals differ in their views of work and art. LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART will mean something very different to two fourteen-year-olds on their first date than to a mature artist couple.

As an example of how the meaning of a metaphor may vary radically within a culture, let us consider some entailments of the metaphor for someone with a view of art very different from our own. Someone who values a work of art not for itself but only as an object for display and someone who thinks that art creates only an illusion, not reality, could see the following as entailments of the metaphor:



Love is an object to be placed on display.

Love exists to be judged and admired by others.

Love creates an illusion.

Love requires hiding the truth.



Because such a person's view of art is different, the metaphor will have a different meaning for him. If his experience of love is pretty much like ours, then the metaphor simply will not fit. In fact, it will be grossly inappropriate. Hence, the same metaphor that gives new meaning to our experiences will not give new meaning to his.

Another example of how a metaphor can create new meaning for us came about by accident. An Iranian student, shortly after his arrival in Berkeley, took a seminar on metaphor from one of us. Among the wondrous things that he found in Berkeley was an expression that he heard over and over and understood as a beautifully sane metaphor. The expression was "the solution of my problems"—which he took to be a large volume of liquid, bubbling and smoking, containing all of your problems, either dissolved or in the form of precipitates, with catalysts constantly dissolving some problems (for the time being) and precipitating out others. He was terribly disillusioned to find that the residents of Berkeley had no such chemical metaphor in mind. And well he might be, for the chemical metaphor is both beautiful and insightful. It gives us a view of problems as things that never disappear utterly and that cannot be solved once and for all. All of your problems are always present, only they may be dissolved and in solution, or they may be in solid form. The best you can hope for is to find a catalyst that will make one problem dissolve without making another one precipitate out. And since you do not have complete control over what goes into the solution, you are constantly finding old and new problems precipitating out and present problems dissolving, partly because of your efforts and partly despite anything you do.

The CHEMICAL metaphor gives us a new view of human problems. It is appropriate to the experience of finding that problems which we once thought were "solved" turn up again and again. The CHEMICAL metaphor says that problems are not the kind of things that can be made to disappear forever. To treat them as things that can be "solved" once and for all is pointless. To live by the CHEMICAL metaphor would be to accept it as a fact that no problem ever disappears forever. Rather than direct your energies toward solving your problems once and for all, you would direct your energies toward finding out what catalysts will dissolve your most pressing problems for the longest time without precipitating out worse ones. The reappearance of a problem is viewed as a natural occurrence rather than a failure on your part to find "the right way to solve it."

To live by the CHEMICAL metaphor would mean that your problems have a different kind of reality for you. A temporary solution would be an accomplishment rather than a failure. Problems would be part of the natural order of things rather than disorders to be "cured." The way you would understand your everyday life and the way you would act in it would be different if you lived by the CHEMCAL metaphor.

We see this as a clear case of the power of metaphor to create a reality rather than simply to give us a way of conceptualizing a preexisting reality. This should not be surprising. As we saw in the case of the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor, there are natural kinds of  activity  (e.g., arguing) that are metaphorical in nature. What the chemical metaphor reveals is that our current way of dealing with problems is another kind of metaphorical activity. At present most of us deal with problems according to what we might call the PUZZLE metaphor, in which problems are PUZZLES for which, typically, there is a correct solution—and, once solved, they are solved forever. The PROBLEMS ARE PUZZLES metaphor characterizes our present reality. A shift to the chemical metaphor would characterize a new reality.

But it is by no means an easy matter to change the metaphors we live by. It is one thing to be aware of the possibilities inherent in the CHEMICAL metaphor, but it is a very different and far more difficult thing to live by it. Each of us has, consciously or unconsciously, identified hundreds of problems, and we are constantly at work on solutions for many of them—via the PUZZLE metaphor. So much of our unconscious everyday activity is structured in terms of the PUZZLE metaphor that we could not possibly make a quick or easy change to the CHEMICAL metaphor on the basis of a conscious decision.

Many of our activities (arguing, solving problems, budgeting time, etc.) are metaphorical in nature. The metaphorical concepts that characterize those activities structure our present reality. New metaphors have the power to create a new reality. This can begin to happen when we start to comprehend our experience in terms of a metaphor, and it becomes a deeper reality when we begin to act in terms of it. If a new metaphor enters the conceptual system that we base our actions on, it will alter that conceptual system and the perceptions and actions that the system gives rise to. Much of cultural change arises from the introduction of new metaphorical concepts and the loss of old ones. For example, the Westernization of cultures throughout the world is partly a matter of introducing the time Is money metaphor into those cultures.

The idea that metaphors can create realities goes against most traditional views of metaphor. The reason is that metaphor has traditionally been viewed as a matter of mere language rather than primarily as a means of structuring our conceptual system and the kinds of everyday activities we perform. It is reasonable enough to assume that words alone don't change reality. But changes in our conceptual system do change what is real for us and affect how we perceive the world and act upon those perceptions.

The idea that metaphor is just a matter of language and can at best only describe reality stems from the view that what is real is wholly external to, and independent of, how human beings conceptualize the world—as if the study of reality were just the study of the physical world. Such a view of reality—so-called objective reality—leaves out human aspects of reality, in particular the real perceptions, conceptualizations, motivations, and actions that constitute most of what we experience. But the human aspects of reality are most of what matters to us, and these vary from culture to culture, since different cultures have different conceptual systems. Cultures also exist within physical environments, some of them radically different—jungles, deserts, islands, tundra, mountains, cities, etc. In each case there is a physical environment that we interact with, more or less successfully. The conceptual systems of various cultures partly depend on the physical environments they have developed in.

Each culture must provide a more or less successful way of dealing with its environment, both adapting to it and changing it. Moreover, each culture must define a social reality within which people have roles that make sense to them and in terms of which they can function socially. Not surprisingly, the social reality defined by a culture affects its conception of physical reality. What is real for an individual as a member of a culture is a product both of his social reality and of the way in which that shapes his experience of the physical world. Since much of our social reality is understood in metaphorical terms, and since our conception of the physical world is partly metaphorical, metaphor plays a very significant role in determining what is real for us.

The Creation of Similarity







We have seen that many of our experiences and activities are metaphorical in nature and that much of our conceptual system is structured by metaphor. Since we see similarities in terms of the categories of our conceptual system and in terms of the natural kinds of experiences we have (both of which may be metaphorical), it follows that many of the similarities that we perceive are a result of conventional metaphors that are part of our conceptual system. We have already seen this in the case of  orientational metaphors.  For example, the orientations more is up and happy is up induce a similarity that we perceive between MORE and HAPPY that we do not see between LESS and HAPPY.

Ontological metaphors  also make similarities possible. We saw, for example, that the viewing of TIME and LABOR metaphorically as uniform SUBSTANCES allows us to view them both as being similar to physical resources and hence as similar to each other. Thus the metaphors time is a SUBSTANCE and LABOR IS A SUBSTANCE allow us to conceive of time and labor as similar in our culture, since both can be quantified, assigned a value per unit, seen as serving a purposeful end, and used up progressively. Since these metaphors play a part in defining what is real for us in this culture, the similarity between time and labor is both based on metaphor and real for our culture.

Structural metaphors  in our conceptual system also induce similarities. Thus, the  IDEAS ARE FOOD  metaphor establishes similarities between  IDEAS  and  FOOD . Both can be digested, swallowed, devoured, and warmed over, and both can nourish you. These similarities do not exist independently of the metaphor. The concept of swallowing food is independent of the metaphor, but the concept of swallowing ideas arises only by virtue of the metaphor. In fact, the  IDEAS ARE FOOD  metaphor is based on still more basic metaphors. For example, it is based partly on the  CONDUIT  metaphor, according to which  IDEAS ARE OBJECTS  and we can get them from outside ourselves. It also assumes the  MIND IS A CONTAINER  metaphor, which establishes a similarity between the mind and the body— both being containers. Together with the  CONDUIT  metaphor, we get a complex metaphor in which  IDEAS ARE OBJECTS THAT COME INTO THE MIND , just as pieces of food are objects that come into the body. It is this metaphorically created similarity between  IDEAS  and  FOOD  that the  IDEAS ARE FOOD  metaphor is partly based on. And, as we have seen, the similarity itself is a consequence of the conduit metaphor and the  MIND  is a  CONTAINER  metaphor.

The  IDEAS ARE FOOD  metaphor fits our experience partly because of this metaphor-induced similarity. The  IDEAS ARE FOOD  metaphor is therefore partly grounded via the mind is a  CONTAINER  and conduit metaphors. As a consequence of the  IDEAS ARE FOOD  metaphor, we get new (metaphorical) similarities between  IDEAS  and  FOOD : both can be swallowed, digested, and devoured, and both can nourish you. These food concepts give us a way of understanding psychological processes that we have no direct and well-defined way of conceptualizing.

Finally, we can see the creation of similarity in  new metaphors  as well. For example, the metaphor  PROBLEMS ARE PRECIPITATES IN A CHEMICAL SOLUTION  is based on the conventional metaphor  PROBLEMS ARE OBJECTS . In addition, the CHEMICAL metaphor adds  PROBLEMS ARE SOLID OBJECTS , which identifies them as the precipitates in a chemical solution. The similarities thus induced between problems as we usually experience them and precipitates in a CHEMICAL solution are: they both have a perceptible form and thus can be identified, analyzed, and acted upon. These similarities are induced by the  PROBLEMS ARE SOLID OBJECTS  part of the chemical metaphor. In addition, when a precipitate is dissolved, it appears to be gone because it does not have a perceptible form and cannot be identified, analyzed, and acted upon. However, it may precipitate out again, i.e., recur in solid form, just as a problem may recur. We perceive this similarity between problems and precipitates as a result of the rest of the chemical metaphor.

A more subtle example of the similarities created by a  new metaphor  can be seen in  LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART . This metaphor highlights certain aspects of love experiences, downplays others, and hides still others. In particular, it downplays those experiences that fit the  LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE  metaphor. By "downplaying," we mean that it is consistent with, but does not focus on, experiences of love that could be reasonably described by "There is a magnetism between us," "We felt sparks," etc. Moreover, it hides those love experiences that fit the love is war metaphor because there is no consistent overlap possible between the two metaphors. The collaborative and cooperative aspects of the  LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF  ART metaphor are inconsistent with (and therefore hide) the aggressive and dominance-oriented aspects of our love experiences as they might be described by "She is my latest conquest," "He surrendered to her," "She overwhelmed me," etc.

By this means, the  LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART  metaphor puts aside some of our love experiences and picks out others to focus on as if they were our only experiences of love. In doing so it induces a set of similarities between the love experiences it highlights and the real or imagined experiences of collaborating on a work of art. These induced similarities are given in our list of entailments ("Love is work," "Love is an aesthetic experience," etc.).

Within the range of highlighted love experiences, each experience fits at least one of the similarities given in the list of entailments, and probably no one of them fits all the entailments. For example, a particularly frustrating episode would fit "Love regularly brings frustration" but might not fit "Love is an aesthetic experience" or "Love is primarily valued for its own sake." Each entailment thus states a similarity that holds between certain types of love experiences, on the one hand, and certain types of experiences of collaborative works of art, on the other. No one entailment shows the overall similarity between the  entire range  of highlighted love experiences and the range of experiences involved in producing a collaborative work of art. It is only the whole metaphor, with its entire system of entailments, that shows the similarities between the full range of highlighted love experiences and the full range of experiences of producing a collaborative work of art.

Moreover, there is a similarity induced by the metaphor that goes beyond the mere similarities between the two ranges of experience. The additional similarity is a  structural  similarity. It involves the way we understand how the individual highlighted experiences fit together in a coherent way. The coherence is provided by the structure of what we know about producing a collaborative work of art and is reflected in the way the entailments fit together (e.g., some are entailments of work, some are entailments of art, some are entailments of  COLLABORATIVE WORK , etc.). It is only this coherent structure that enables us to understand what the highlighted experiences have to do with each other and how the entailments are related to each other. Thus, by virtue of the metaphor, the range of highlighted love experiences is seen as similar  in structure  to the range of experiences of producing a collaborative work of art.

It is this  structural  similarity between the two ranges of experience that allows you  to find coherence  in the range of highlighted love experiences. Correspondingly, it is by virtue of the metaphor that the highlighted range of experiences is picked out as being coherent. Without the metaphor, this range of experiences does not exist for you as being an identifiable and coherent set of experiences. Conceptualizing  LOVE  as  A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART  brings them into focus as fitting together into a coherent whole.

Moreover, the metaphor, by virtue of giving coherent structure to a range of our experiences,  creates similarities of a new kind . For example, we might, independently of the metaphor, see a frustrating love experience as similar to a frustrating experience in producing a work of art jointly with someone, since they are both frustrating. In this sense, the frustrating love experience would also be similar to  any  frustrating experience at all. What the metaphor adds to an understanding of the frustrating love experience is that the  kind  of frustration involved is that involved in producing collaborative artworks. The similarity is similarity with respect to the metaphor.

Thus the precise nature of the similarity between the frustrating love experience and the frustrating art experience is perceived only in understanding the love experience in terms of the art experience. Understanding love experiences in terms of what is involved in producing a collaborative work of art is, by our definition, to comprehend that experience in terms of the metaphorical concept  LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART.

We can summarize the ways in which metaphors create similarities as follows:

1. Conventional metaphors (orientational, ontological, and structural) are often based on correlations we perceive in our experience. For example, in an industrial culture such as ours there is a correlation between the amount of time a task takes and the amount of labor it takes to accomplish the task. This correlation is part of what allows us to view time and labor metaphorically as resources and hence to see a similarity between them. It is important to remember that correlations are not similarities. Metaphors that are based on correlations in our experience define concepts in terms of which we perceive similarities.

2. Conventional metaphors of the structural variety (e.g.,  IDEAS ARE FOOD ) may be based on similarities that arise out of orientational and ontological metaphors. As we saw, for example,  IDEAS ARE FOOD  is based on  IDEAS ARE OBJECTS  (ontological) and  THE MIND IS A CONTAINER  (ontological and orientational). A structural similarity between  IDEAS  and  FOOD  is induced by the metaphor and gives rise to metaphorical similarities ( IDEAS  and  FOOD  can be swallowed, digested, and devoured, can provide nourishment, etc.).

3. New metaphors are mostly structural. They can create similarities in the same way as conventional metaphors that are structural. That is, they can be based on similarities that arise from ontological and orientational metaphors. As we saw,  PROBLEMS ARE PRECIPITATES IN A CHEMICAL SOLUTION  is based on the physical metaphor  PROBLEMS ARE SOLID OBJECTS . This metaphor creates similarities between problems and precipitates, since both can be identified, analyzed, and acted upon. The problems are precipitates metaphor creates new similarities, namely, problems can appear to be gone (dissolve into solutions) and later reappear (precipitate out).

4. New metaphors, by virtue of their entailments, pick out a range of experiences by highlighting, downplaying, and hiding. The metaphor then characterizes a similarity between the entire range of highlighted experiences and some other range of experiences. For example, love is a collaborative work of art picks out a certain range of our love experiences and defines a  structural  similarity between the  entire range  of highlighted experiences and the range of experiences involved in producing collaborative works of art. There may be isolated similarities between love and art experiences that are independent of the metaphor, but the metaphor allows us to find coherence in these isolated similarities in terms of the overall structural similarities induced by the metaphor.

5. Similarities may be similarities with respect to a metaphor. As we saw, the love is a collaborative work of art metaphor defines a unique  kind  of similarity. For example, a frustrating love experience may be understood as being similar to a frustrating art experience not merely by virtue of being frustrating but as involving the  kind  of frustration peculiar to jointly producing works of art.

Our view that metaphors can create similarities runs counter to the classical and still most widely held theory of metaphor, namely, the  comparison theory.  The comparison theory says:



1. Metaphors are matters of language and not matters of thought or action. There is no such thing as metaphorical thought or action.



2. A metaphor of the form "A is 2?" is a linguistic expression whose meaning is the same as a corresponding linguistic expression of the form  "A  is  like Β,  in respects X,  Υ, Ζ . . . .  " "Respects Χ, Y, Z, ..." characterize what we have called "isolated similarities."



3. A metaphor can therefore only describe preexisting similarities. It cannot create similarities.



Though we have given evidence against much of the comparison theory, we accept what we take to be its basic insight, namely, that metaphors can be based on isolated similarities. We differ with the comparison theory by maintaining that:



1. Metaphor is primarily a matter of thought and action and only derivatively a matter of language.



2.a. Metaphors can be based on similarities, though in many cases these similarities are themselves based on conventional metaphors that are not based on similarities. Similarities based on conventional metaphors are nonetheless  real in our culture , since conventional metaphors partly define what we find real.



2.b. Though the metaphor may be based partly on isolated similarities, we see the important similarities as those created by the metaphor, as described above.



3. The primary function of metaphor is to provide a partial understanding of one kind of experience in terms of another kind of experience. This may involve preexisting isolated similarities, the creation of new similarities, and more.



It is important to bear in mind that the comparison theory most often goes hand in hand with an objectivist philosophy in which all similarities are objective, that is, they are similarities inherent in the entities themselves. We argue, on the contrary, that the only similarities relevant to metaphor are  similarities as experienced by people . The difference between  objective similarities  and  experiential similarities  is all-important, and is discussed in detail in chapter 27. Briefly, an objectivist would say that objects have the properties they have independently of anyone who experiences them; the objects are  objectively similar  if they share those properties. To an objectivist it would make no sense to speak of metaphors as " creating  similarities," since that would require metaphors to be able to change the nature of the external world, bringing into existence objective similarities that did not previously exist.

We agree with objectivists on one major point: that things in the world do play a role in constraining our conceptual system. But they play this role  only through our experience of them.  Our experiences will (1) differ from culture to culture and (2) may depend on our understanding one kind of experience in terms of another, that is, our experiences may be metaphorical in nature. Such experiences determine the categories of our conceptual system. And properties and similarities, we maintain, exist and can be experienced only relative to a conceptual system. Thus, the only kind of similarities relevant to metaphors are  experiential , not  objective , similarities.

Our general position is that conceptual metaphors are grounded in  correlations  within our experience. These experiential correlations may be of two types:  experiential cooccurrence  and  experiential similarity.  An example of experiential cooccurrence would be the  MORE IS UP  metaphor, more is up is grounded in the cooccurrence of two types of experiences: adding more of a substance and seeing the level of the substance rise. Here there is no experiential similarity at all. An example of experiential similarity is  LIFE IS A GAMBLING GAME , where one experiences actions in life as gambles, and the possible consequences of those actions are perceived as winning or losing. Here the metaphor seems to be grounded in experiential similarity. When such a metaphor is extended, we may experience new similarities between life and gambling games.

Metaphor, Truth, and Action







In the preceding chapter we suggested the following:



Metaphors have entailments through which they highlight and make coherent certain aspects of our experience.



A given metaphor may be the only way to highlight and coherently organize exactly those aspects of our experience.



Metaphors may create realities for us, especially social realities. A metaphor may thus be a guide for future action. Such actions will, of course, fit the metaphor. This will, in turn, reinforce the power of the metaphor to make experience coherent. In this sense metaphors can be self-fulfilling prophecies.



For example, faced with the energy crisis, President Carter declared "the moral equivalent of war." The war metaphor generated a network of entailments. There was an "enemy," a "threat to national security," which required "setting targets," "reorganizing priorities," "establishing a new chain of command," "plotting new strategy," "gathering intelligence," "marshaling forces," "imposing sanctions," "calling for sacrifices," and on and on. The war metaphor highlighted certain realities and hid others. The metaphor was not merely a way of viewing reality; it constituted a license for policy change and political and economic action. The very acceptance of the metaphor provided grounds for certain inferences: there was an external, foreign, hostile enemy (pictured by cartoonists in Arab headdress); energy needed to be given top priorities; the populace would have to make sacrifices; if we didn't meet the threat, we would not survive. It is important to realize that this was not the only metaphor available.

Carter's war metaphor took for granted our current concept of what energy is, and focused on how to get enough of it. On the other hand, Amory Lovins (1977) observed that there are two fundamentally different ways, or paths, to supply our energy needs. He characterized these metaphorically as hard and soft. The hard energy path uses energy supplies that are inflexible, nonrenewable, needing military defense and geopolitical control, irreversibly destructive of the environment, and requiring high capital investment, high technology, and highly skilled workers. They include fossil fuels (gas and oil), nuclear power plants, and coal gasification. The soft energy path uses energy supplies that are flexible, renewable, not needing military defense or geopolitical control, not destructive of the environment, and requiring only low capital investment, low technology, and unskilled labor. They include solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, biomass alcohol, fluidized beds for burning coal or other combustible materials, and a great many other possibilities currently available. Lovins' soft energy path metaphor highlights the technical, economic, and sociopolitical  structure  of the energy system, which leads him to the conclusion that the "hard" energy paths—coal, oil, and nuclear power—lead to political conflict, economic hardship, and harm to the environment. But Jimmy Carter is more powerful than Amory Lovins. As Charlotte Linde (in conversation) has observed, whether in national politics or in everyday interaction, people in power get to impose their metaphors.

New metaphors, like conventional metaphors, can have the power to define reality. They do this through a coherent network of entailments that highlight some features of reality and hide others. The acceptance of the metaphor, which forces us to focus  only  on those aspects of our experience that it highlights, leads us to view the entailments of the metaphor as being  true.  Such "truths" may be true, of course, only relative to the reality defined by the metaphor. Suppose Carter announces that his administration has won a major energy battle. Is this claim true or false? Even to address oneself to the question requires accepting at least the central parts of the metaphor. If you do not accept the existence of an external enemy, if you think there is no external threat, if you recognize no field of battle, no targets, no clearly defined competing forces, then the issue of objective truth or falsity cannot arise. But if you see reality as defined by the metaphor, that is, if you do see the energy crisis as a war, then you can answer the question relative to whether the metaphorical entailments fit reality. If Carter, by means of strategically employed political and economic sanctions, forced the OPEC nations to cut the price of oil in half, then you would say that he would indeed have won a major battle. If, on the other hand, his strategies had produced only a temporary price freeze, you couldn't be so sure and might be skeptical.

Though questions of truth do arise for new metaphors, the more important questions are those of appropriate action. In most cases, what is at issue is not the truth or falsity of a metaphor but the perceptions and inferences that follow from it and the actions that are sanctioned by it. In all aspects of life, not just in politics or in love, we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of the metaphors. We draw inferences, set goals, make commitments, and execute plans, all on the basis of how we in part structure our experience, consciously and unconsciously, by means of metaphor.

Truth









Why Care about a Theory of Truth?





Metaphors, as we have seen, are conceptual in nature. They are among our principal vehicles for understanding. And they play a central role in the construction of social and political reality. Yet they are typically viewed within philosophy as matters of "mere language," and philosophical discussions of metaphor have not centered on their conceptual nature, their contribution to understanding, or their function in cultural reality. Instead, philosophers have tended to look at metaphors as out-of-the-ordinary imaginative or poetic linguistic expressions, and their discussions have centered on whether these linguistic expressions can be  true.  Their concern with truth comes out of a concern with objectivity:  truth  for them means  objective, absolute  truth. The typical philosophical conclusion is that metaphors cannot directly state truths, and, if they can state truths at all, it is only indirectly, via some nonmetaphorical "literal" paraphrase.

We do not believe that there is such a thing as  objective  (absolute and unconditional)  truth , though it has been a long-standing theme in Western culture that there is. We do believe that there are  truths  but think that the idea of truth need not be tied to the objectivist view. We believe that the idea that there is absolute objective truth is not only mistaken but socially and politically dangerous. As we have seen, truth is always relative to a conceptual system that is defined in large part by metaphor. Most of our metaphors have evolved in our culture over a long period, but many are imposed upon us by people in power—political leaders, religious leaders, business leaders, advertisers, the media, etc. In a culture where the myth of objectivism is very much alive and truth is always absolute truth, the people who get to impose their metaphors on the culture get to define what we consider to be true—absolutely and objectively true.

It is for this reason that we see it as important to give an account of truth that is free of the myth of objectivism (according to which truth is always absolute truth). Since we see truth as based on understanding and see metaphor as a principal vehicle of understanding, we think that an account of how metaphors can be true will reveal the way in which truth depends upon understanding.



The Importance of Truth in Our Daily Lives





We base our actions, both physical and social, on what we take to be true. On the whole, truth matters to us because it has survival value and allows us to function in our world. Most of the truths we accumulate—about our bodies, the people we interact with, and our immediate physical and social environments—play a role in daily functioning. They are truths so obvious that it takes a conscious effort to become aware of them: where the front door of the house is, what you can and can't eat, where the nearest gas station is, what stores sell the things you need, what your friends are like, what it would take to insult them, what responsibilities you have. This tiny sample suggests the nature and extent of the vast body of truths that play a role in our daily lives.



The Role of Projection in Truth





In order to acquire such truths and to make use of them, we need an understanding of our world sufficient for our needs. As we have seen, some of this understanding is cast in terms of categories that emerge from our direct experience:orientational categories, concepts like  OBJECT, SUBSTANCE, PURPOSE, CAUSE,   etc. We have also seen that when the categories that emerge from direct physical experience do not apply, we sometimes project these categories onto aspects of the physical world that we have less direct experience of. For example, we project a front-back orientation in context onto objects that have no intrinsic fronts or backs. Given a medium-sized rock in our visual field and a ball between us and the rock, say, a foot from it, we would perceive the ball as being  in front of  the rock. The Hausas make a different projection than we do and would understand the ball as being  in back of  the rock. Thus, a frontback orientation is not an inherent property of objects like rocks but rather an orientation that we project onto them, and the way we do this varies from culture to culture. Relative to our purposes, we can conceive of things in the world as being containers or not. We can, for example, conceive of a clearing in a forest as being a  CONTAINER  and understand ourselves as being IN the clearing, or OUT OF it. Being a container is not an inherent property of that place in the woods where the trees are less dense; it is a property that we project onto it relative to the way we function with respect to it. Relative to other perceptions and purposes, we can view the rest of the forest outside the clearing as a different container and perceive ourselves as being in the forest. And we can do both simultaneously and speak of  EMERGING FROM  the forest  INTO  the clearing.

Similarly, our on-off orientation emerges from our direct experience with the ground, floors, and other horizontal surfaces. Typically, we are  on  the ground, floor, etc., if we are standing on it with our bodies erect. We also project on-off orientations onto walls and conceive of a fly as standing  on  the wall if its legs are in contact with it and its head is oriented away from the wall. The same carries over to the fly on the ceiling: we conceive of it as being  on  rather than  under  the ceiling.

As we have also seen, we perceive various things in the natural world as entities, often projecting boundaries and surfaces on them where no clear-cut boundaries or surfaces exist naturally. Thus we can conceive of a fogbank as an entity that can be  over  the bay (which we conceive as an entity) and  in front of  the mountain (conceived as an entity with a front-back orientation). By virtue of these projections, a sentence like "The fog is in front of the mountain" may be  true.  As is typically the case in our daily lives, truth is relative to understanding, and the truth of such a sentence is relative to the normal way we understand the world by projecting orientation and entity structure onto it.



The Role of Categorization in Truth





In order to understand the world and function in it, we have to categorize, in ways that make sense to us, the things and experiences that we encounter. Some of our categories emerge directly from our experience, given the way our bodies are and the nature of our interactions with other people and with our physical and social environments. As we saw in our discussion of the  FAKE GUN  example in chapter 19, there are natural dimensions to our categories for objects:  perceptual,  based on the conception of the object by means of our sensory apparatus;  motor activity,  based on the nature of motor interactions with objects;  functional,  based on our conception of the functions of the object; and  purposive,  based on the uses we can make of an object in a given situation. Our categories for kinds of objects are thus gestalts with at least these natural dimensions, each of which specifies interactional properties. Similarly, there are natural dimensions in terms of which we categorize events, activities, and other experiences as structured wholes. As we saw in our discussion of conversation and argument, these natural dimensions include  participants, parts, stages, linear sequence, purpose,  and  causation.

A categorization is a natural way of identifying a  kind  of object or experience by highlighting certain properties, downplaying others, and hiding still others. Each of the dimensions gives the properties that are highlighted. To highlight certain properties is necessarily to downplay or hide others, which is what happens whenever we categorize something. Focusing on one set of properties shifts our attention away from others. When we give everyday descriptions, for example, we are using categorizations to focus on certain properties that fit our purposes. Every description will highlight, downplay, and hide—for example:



I've invited a sexy blonde to our dinner party.

I've invited a renowned cellist to our dinner party.

I've invited a Marxist to our dinner party.

I've invited a lesbian to our dinner party.



Though the same person may fit all of these descriptions, each description highlights different aspects of the person. Describing someone who you know has all of these properties as "a sexy blonde" is to downplay the fact that she is a renowned cellist and a Marxist and to hide her lesbianism.

In general, the true statements that we make are based on the way we categorize things and, therefore, on what is highlighted by the natural dimensions of the categories. In making a statement, we make a choice of categories because we have some reason for focusing on certain properties and downplaying others. Every true statement, therefore, necessarily leaves out what is downplayed or hidden by the categories used in it.

Moreover, since the natural dimensions of categories (perceptual, functional, etc.) arise out of our interactions with the world, the properties given by those dimensions are not properties of objects  in themselves  but are, rather, interactional properties, based on the human perceptual apparatus, human conceptions of function, etc. It follows from this that true statements made in terms of human categories typically do not predicate  properties of objects in themselves  but rather  interactional properties  that make sense only relative to human functioning.

In making a true statement, we have to choose categories of description, and that choice involves our perceptions and our purposes in the given situation. Suppose you say to me, "We're having a discussion group over tonight, and I need four more chairs. Can you bring them?" I say "Sure," and show up with a hardback chair, a rocking chair, a beanbag chair, and a hassock. Leaving them in your living room, I report to you in the kitchen, "I brought the four chairs you wanted." In this situation, my statement is true, since the four objects I've brought will serve the purpose of chairs for an informal discussion group. Had you instead asked me to bring four chairs for a formal dinner and I show up with the same four objects and make the same statement, you will not be appropriately grateful and will find the statement misleading or false, since the hassock, beanbag chair, and rocker are not practical as "chairs" at a formal dinner.

This shows that our categories (e.g.,  CHAIR ) are not rigidly fixed in terms of inherent properties of the objects themselves. What counts as an instance of a category depends on our purpose in using the category. This is the same point we made above, in our discussion  of Definition,  where we showed that categories are defined for purposes of human understanding by prototypes and family resemblances to those prototypes. Such categories are not fixed but may be narrowed, expanded, or adjusted relative to our purposes and other contextual factors. Since the truth of a statement depends on whether the categories employed in the statement fit, the truth of a statement will always be relative to the way the category is understood for our purposes in a given context.

There are many celebrated examples to show that sentences, in general, are not true or false independent of human purposes:





France is hexagonal.





Missouri is a parallelogram.





The earth is a sphere.





Italy is boot-shaped.





An atom is a tiny solar system with the nucleus at the center and electrons whirling around it.





Light consists of particles.





Light consists of waves.





Each of these sentences is true for certain purposes, in certain respects, and in certain contexts. "France is a hexagon" and "Missouri is a parallelogram" can be true for a schoolboy who has to draw rough maps but not for professional cartographers. "The earth is a sphere" is true as far as most of us are concerned, but it won't do for precisely plotting the orbit of a satellite. No self-respecting physicist has believed since 1914 that an atom is a tiny solar system, but it is true for most of us relative to our everyday functioning and our general level of sophistication in mathematics and physics. "Light consists of particles" seems to contradict "Light consists of waves," but both are taken as true by physicists relative to which aspects of light are picked out by different experiments.

What all of this shows is that truth depends on categorization in the following four ways:



—A statement can be true only relative to some understanding of it.

—Understanding always involves human categorization, which is a function of interactional (rather than inherent) properties and of dimensions that emerge from our experience.

—The truth of a statement is always relative to the properties that are highlighted by the categories used in the statement. (For example, "Light consists of waves" highlights wavelike properties of light and hides particle-like properties.)

—Categories are neither fixed nor uniform. They are defined by prototypes and family resemblances to prototypes and are adjustable in context, given various purposes. Whether a statement is true depends on whether the category employed in the statement fits, and this in turn varies with human purposes and other aspects of context.





What Does It Take to Understand a Simple Sentence as Being True?





To understand a sentence as being true, we must first understand it. Let us look at part of what is involved in understanding such simple sentences as "The fog is in front of the mountain" and "John fired the gun at Harry." Sentences like these are always uttered as part of discourses of some kind, and understanding them in a discourse context involves complications of a nontrivial sort that, for our purposes, we must ignore here. But, even ignoring some of the complexities of discourse context, any understanding of such sentences involves quite a bit. Consider what must be the case for us to understand "The fog is in front of the mountain" as being true. As we saw above, we have to view "the fog" and "the mountain" as entities, by means of projection, and we must project a front-back orientation on the mountain—an orientation which varies from culture to culture, is given relative to a human observer, and is not inherent in the mountain. We must then determine, relative to our purposes, whether what we view as "the fog" is pretty much between us and what we pick out as "the mountain," closer to the mountain, and not to the side of the mountain, or above it, etc. There are three projections onto the world plus some pragmatic determinations, relative to our perceptions and purposes, as to whether the relation  in front of  is more appropriate than other possible relations. Thus, understanding whether "The fog is in front of the mountain" is true is not merely a matter of  (a)  picking out preexisting and well-defined entities in the world (the fog and the mountain) and (b) seeing whether some inherent relation (independent of any human observer) holds between these well-defined entities. Instead, it is a matter of human projection and human judgment, relative to certain purposes.

"John fired the gun at Harry" raises other issues. There are the obvious matters of picking out people named  John  and  Harry,  picking out the object that fits the category GUN, understanding what it means to fire a gun and to fire it at someone. But we don't understand sentences like this  in vacuo.  We understand them relative to certain larger categories of experience, for example, shooting someone, scaring someone, performing a circus act, or pretending to do any of these in a play or film or joke. Firing a gun can be an instance of any of these, and which is applicable will depend on the context. But there is only a small range of categories of experience that firing a gun fits into, the most typical of which is  SHOOTING SOMEONE , since there are many typical ways to scare someone or perform a circus act but only one normal way to shoot someone.

We can thus view  SHOOTING SOMEONE  as an experiential gestalt with roughly the following dimensions, in this instance:











The sentence "John fired the gun at Harry" typically evokes a  SHOOTING SOMEONE  gestalt of this form. Or it could, in other contexts, evoke other equally complex experiential gestalts (e.g.,  PERFORMING A CIRCUS ACT ). But the sentence is virtually never understood on its own terms without the evocation of some larger gestalt that specifies the normal range of natural dimensions (e.g., purpose, stages, etc.). Whichever gestalt is evoked, we understand much more than is given directly in the sentence. Each such gestalt provides a background for understanding the sentence in terms that make sense to us, that is, in terms of an experiential category of our culture.

In addition to the larger category of experience evoked by the sentence, we also categorize  FIRING  and  GUN  in terms of information-rich prototypes. Unless the context forces us to do otherwise, we understand the gun to be a prototypical gun, with the usual prototypical  perceptual, motor, functional , and  purpose  properties. Unless the context specifies otherwise, the image evoked is not that of an umbrella gun or a suitcase gun, and the motor program used in firing is holding the gun horizontal and squeezing the trigger, which is the normal motor program that fits both  FIRING  and  GUN . Unless the context is rigged, we do not imagine a Rube Goldberg device in which the trigger is tied by a string to, say, a door handle.

We understand the sentence in terms of the way these gestalts fit together, both the "smaller" gestalts ( GUN ,  FIRING, AIMING , etc.) and the "larger" gestalts ( SHOOTING SOMEONE  or  PERFORMING A CIRCUS ACT ). Only relative to such understandings do issues of truth arise. The issue of truth is straightforward when our understanding of the sentence in these terms fits closely enough our understanding of the events that have occurred. But what happens when there is a discrepancy between our  normal  understanding of the sentence and our understanding of the events? Say, for example, that John, in an ingenious Rube Goldberg fashion, set up the gun so that it would be aimed at a point where Harry would be at some time and then tied a string to the trigger. Let's take two cases:



A.  John's scratching his ear causes the gun to fire at Harry.

B. Harry's opening the door causes the gun to fire at Harry.



In case A, John's action is responsible for the firing, while, in B, Harry's action is. This makes A closer than B to our normal understanding of the sentence. Thus, we might, if pressed, be willing to say that A is a case where it would be true to say "John fired the gun at Harry." Case B, however, is so far from our prototypical understanding of firing that we would probably not want to say that it was true that "John fired the gun at Harry." But we would not want to say that it was unqualifiedly false either, since John was primarily responsible for the shooting. Instead, we'd want to explain, not just answer "True" or "False." This is what typically happens when our understanding of the events does not fit our normal understanding of the sentence because of some deviation from a prototype.

We can summarize the results of this section as follows:





Understanding a sentence as being true in a given situation requires having an understanding of the sentence and having an understanding of the situation.

We understand a sentence as being true when our understanding of the sentence fits our understanding of the situation closely enough.

Getting an understanding of a situation of the sort that could fit our understanding of a sentence may require:







Projecting an orientation onto something that has no inherent orientation (e.g., viewing the mountain as having a front)

Projecting an entity structure onto something that is not bounded in any clear sense (e.g., the fog, the mountain)

Providing a background in terms of which the sentence makes sense, that is, calling up an experiential gestalt (e.g.,  SHOOTING SOMEONE ,  PERFORMING A CIRCUS ACT ) and understanding the situation in terms of the gestalt

Getting a "normal" understanding of the sentence in terms of its categories (e.g.,  GUN ,  FIRING ), as defined by prototype, and trying to get an understanding of the situation in terms of the same categories





What Does It Take to Understand a Conventional Metaphor as Being True?





We have seen what is involved in understanding a simple sentence (without metaphor) as being true. We now want to suggest that adding conventional metaphors changes nothing. We understand them as being true in basically the same way. Take a sentence like "Inflation has gone up." Understanding a situation as one in which this sentence could be true involves two projections. We have to pick out instances of inflation and view them as constituting a substance, which we can then quantify and thereby view as increasing. In addition we have to project an UP orientation on the increase. These two projections constitute two conventional metaphors:  INFLATION IS A SUBSTANCE  (an ontological metaphor) and  MORE IS UP  (an orientational metaphor). There is one principal difference between the projections onto the situation in this case and in the case given above, namely, "The fog is in front of the mountain." In the case of  fog,  we are understanding something physical (fog) on the model of something else physical but more clearly delineated—a bounded physical object. In the case of  front,  we are understanding the physical orientation of the mountain in terms of another physical orientation—that of our bodies. In both cases, we are understanding something that is physical in terms of something  else  that is  also  physical. In other words, we are understanding one thing in terms of something else  of the same kind.  But in conventional metaphor, we are understanding one thing in terms of something else  of a different kind.  In "Inflation has gone up," for example, we understand  inflation  (which is abstract) in terms of a physical substance, and we understand an increase of inflation (which is also abstract) in terms of a physical orientation (up). The only difference is whether our projection involves the  same  kinds of things or  different  kinds of things.

When we understand a sentence like "Inflation has gone up" as being true, we do the following:



1. We understand the  situation  by metaphorical projection in two ways:





We view inflation as a  SUBSTANCE  (via an ontological metaphor).

We view  MORE  as being oriented  UP  (via an orientational metaphor).



2. We understand the  sentence  in terms of the same two metaphors.

3. This allows us to fit our understanding of the sentence to our understanding of the situation.



Thus an understanding of truth in terms of metaphorical projection is not essentially different from an understanding of truth in terms of nonmetaphorical projection. The only difference is that metaphorical projection involves understanding one kind of thing in terms of another kind of thing. That is, metaphorical projection involves two different kinds of things, while nonmetaphorical projection involves only one kind.

The same holds for structural metaphors, also. Take a sentence like "John defended his position in the argument." As we saw above, the experience of arguing is structured partially in terms of the WAR gestalt, by virtue of the  ARGUMENT IS WAR  metaphor. Since argument is a metaphorical kind of experience, structured by the conventional metaphor  ARGUMENT IS WAR , it follows that a situation in which there is an argument may be understood in these metaphorical terms. Our understanding of an argument situation will involve viewing it simultaneously in terms of both the  CONVERSATION  gestalt and the  WAR  gestalt. If our understanding of the situation is such that a portion of the conversation fits a successful defense in the WAR gestalt, then our understanding of the sentence will fit our understanding of the situation and we will take the sentence to be true.

In both the metaphorical and nonmetaphorical cases, our account of how we understand truth depends on our account of how we understand situations. Given that metaphor is conceptual in nature rather than a matter of "mere language," it is natural for us to conceptualize situations in metaphorical terms. Because we can conceptualize  situations  in metaphorical terms, it is possible for  sentences  containing metaphors to be taken as fitting the situations as we conceptualize them.



How Do We Understand New Metaphors as Being True?





We have just seen that conventional metaphors fit our account of truth in the same way as nonmetaphorical sentences do. In both cases, understanding a sentence as true in a given situation involves fitting our understanding of the sentence to our understanding of the situation. Because our understanding of situations may involve conventional metaphor, sentences with conventional metaphors raise no special problems for our account of truth. This suggests that the same account of truth should work for new, or nonconventional, metaphors.

To see this, let us consider two related metaphors, one conventional and one nonconventional:





Tell me the  story of your life,  (conventional)





Life's ... a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, (nonconventional)





Let us start with "Tell me the story of your life," which contains the conventional metaphor  LIFE IS A STORY . This is a metaphor rooted deep in our culture. It is assumed that everyone's life is structured like a story, and the entire biographical and autobiographical tradition is based on this assumption. Suppose someone asks you to tell your life story. What do you do? You construct a coherent narrative that starts early in your life and continues up to the present. Typically the narrative will have the following features:

















This is a much oversimplified version of a typical experiential gestalt for giving coherence to one's life by viewing it as a  STORY . We have omitted various complexities, such as the fact that each episode may in itself be a coherent subnarrative with a similar structure. Not all life stories will contain all of these dimensions of structure.

Notice that understanding your life in terms of a coherent life story involves highlighting certain  participants  and  parts  (episodes and states) and ignoring or hiding others. It involves seeing your life in terms of  stages, causal connections  among the parts, and  plans  meant to achieve a  goal  or a set of goals. In general, a life story imposes a coherent structure on elements of your life that are highlighted.

If you tell such a story and then say, "That is the story of my life," you will legitimately see yourself as telling the truth if you do, in fact, view the highlighted participants and events as the significant ones and do, in fact, perceive them as fitting together coherently in the way specified by the structure of the narrative. The issue of truth in this case is whether the coherence provided by the narrative matches the coherence you see in your life. And it is the coherence that you see in your life that gives it meaning and significance.

Let us now ask what is involved in understanding as true the nonconventional metaphor "Life's ... a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." This non-conventional metaphor evokes the conventional metaphor  LIFE IS A STORY . The most salient fact about stories told by idiots is that they are not coherent. They start off as if they were coherent stories with stages, causal connections, and overall purposes, but they suddenly shift over and over again, making it impossible to find coherence as you go along or any coherence overall. A life story of this sort would have no coherent structure for us and therefore no way of providing meaning or significance to our lives. There would be no way of highlighting events in your life as being significant, that is, as serving a purpose, having a causal connection to other significant events, fitting stages, etc. In a life viewed as a tale, episodes "full of sound and fury" would represent periods of frenzy, agonized struggle, and perhaps violence. In a typical life story, such events would be viewed as momentous—either traumatic, cathartic, disastrous, or climactic. But the modifier "signifying nothing" negates all these possibilities for significance, suggesting instead that the episodes cannot be viewed in terms of causal connections, purposes, or identifiable stages in some coherent whole.

If we in fact view our lives and the lives of others in this way, then we would take the metaphor as being true. What makes it possible for many of us to see this metaphor as true is that we usually comprehend our life experiences in terms of the  LIFE IS A STORY  metaphor. We are constantly looking for meaning in our lives by seeking out coherences that will fit some sort of coherent life story. And we constantly tell such stories and live in terms of them. As the circumstances of our lives change, we constantly revise our life stories, seeking new coherence.

The metaphor  LIFE'S . . . A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT  may well fit the lives of people whose life circumstances change so radically, rapidly, and unexpectedly that no coherent life story ever seems possible for them.

Although we have seen that such new, nonconventional metaphors will fit our general account of truth, we should stress again that issues of truth are among the least relevant and interesting issues that arise in the study of metaphor. The real significance of the metaphor  LIFE'S ... A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT  is that, in getting us to try to understand how it could be true, it makes possible a new understanding of our lives. It highlights the fact that we are constantly functioning under the expectation of being able to fit our lives into some coherent life story but that this expectation may be constantly frustrated when the most salient experiences in our lives, those full of sound and fury, do not fit any coherent whole and, therefore, signify nothing. Normally, when we construct life stories, we leave out many extremely important experiences for the sake of finding coherence. What the  LIFE'S ... A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT  metaphor does is to evoke the LIFE IS A STORY metaphor, which involves living with the constant expectation of fitting important episodes into a coherent whole—a sane life story. The effect of the metaphor is to evoke this expectation and to point out that, in reality, it may be constantly frustrated.



Understanding a Situation: A Summary





In this chapter we have been developing the elements of an experiential account of truth. Our account of truth is based on understanding. What is central to this theory is our analysis of what it means to understand a situation. Here is a summary of what we have said on the matter so far:





Direct Immediate Understanding







There are many things that we understand directly from our direct physical involvement as an inseparable part of our immediate environment.



Entity structure:  We understand ourselves as bounded entities, and we directly experience certain objects that we come into direct contact with as bounded entities, too.



Orientational structure:  We understand ourselves and other objects as having certain orientations relative to the environments we function in (up-down, in-out, front-back, on-off, etc.).



Dimensions of experience:  There are dimensions of experience in terms of which we function most of the time in our direct interactions with others and with our immediate physical and cultural environment. We categorize the entities we directly encounter and the direct experiences we have in terms of these categories.



Experiential gestalts:  Our object and substance categories are gestalts that have at least the following dimensions:  perceptual, motor activity, part/whole, functional, purposive.  Our categories of direct actions, activities, events, and experiences are gestalts that have at least the following dimensions:  participants, parts, motor activities, perceptions, stages, linear sequences (of parts), causal relations, purpose (goals/plans  for actions and  end states  for events). These constitute the natural dimensions of our direct experience. Not all of them will play a role in every kind of direct experience, but, in general, most of them will play some role or other.



Background:  An experiential gestalt will typically serve as a background for understanding something we experience as an aspect of that gestalt. Thus a person or object may be understood as a  participant  in a gestalt, and an action may be understood as a  part  of a gestalt. One gestalt may presuppose the presence of another, which may, in turn, presuppose the presence of others, and so on. The result will typically be an incredibly rich background structure necessary for a full understanding of any given situation. Most of this background structure will never be noticed, since it is presupposed in so many of our daily activities and experiences.



Highlighting:  Understanding a situation as being an instance of an experiential gestalt involves picking out elements of the situation as fitting the dimensions of the gestalt—for example, picking out aspects of the experience as being  participants, parts, stages,  etc. This highlights those aspects of the situation and downplays or hides aspects of the situation that do not fit the gestalt.



Interactional properties:  The properties we directly experience an object or event as having are products of our interactions with them in our environment. That is, they may not be  inherent  properties of the object or experience but, instead,  interactional  properties.



Prototypes:  Each category is structured in terms of a prototype, and something counts as a member of the category by virtue of the family resemblances it bears to the prototype.







Indirect Understanding







We have just described how we understand aspects of a situation that are fairly clearly delineated in our direct experience. But we have seen throughout this work that many aspects of our experience cannot be clearly delineated in terms of the naturally emergent dimensions of our experience. This is typically the case for human emotions, abstract concepts, mental activity, time, work, human institutions, social practices, etc., and even for physical objects that have no inherent boundaries or orientations. Though most of these can be  experienced  directly, none of them can be fully comprehended on their own terms. Instead, we must understand them in terms of other entities and experiences, typically other  kinds  of entities and experiences.

As we saw, understanding a situation where we see the fog as being in front of the mountain requires us to view the fog and the mountain as entities. It also requires us to project a front-back orientation upon the mountain. These projections are built into our very perception. We perceive the fog and the mountain as entities and we perceive the mountain as having a front, with the fog in front of it. The front-back orientation that we perceive for the mountain is obviously an interactional property, as is the status of the fog and the mountain as entities. Here we have a case of indirect understanding, where we are understanding physical phenomena in terms of other more clearly delineated physical phenomena.

What we do in indirect understanding is to use the resources of direct understanding. In the case of the fog and the mountain, we are using entity structure and orientational structure. In this case we stayed within a single domain, that of physical objects. But most of our indirect understanding involves understanding  one kind  of entity or experience in terms of  another kind —that is, understanding via metaphor. As we have seen, all of the resources that are used in direct, immediate understanding are pressed into service in indirect understanding via metaphor.



Entity structure:  Entity and substance structure is imposed via ontological metaphor.



Orientational structure:  Orientational structure is imposed via orientational metaphor.



Dimensions of experience:  Structural metaphor involves structuring one kind of thing or experience in terms of another kind, but the same natural dimensions of experience are used in both  (e.g., parts, stages, purposes,  etc.).



Experiential gestalts:  Structural metaphor involves imposing part of one gestalt structure upon another.



Background:  Experiential gestalts play the role of a background in metaphorical understanding, just as they do in nonmetaphorical understanding.



Highlighting:  Metaphorical highlighting works by the same mechanism as that for nonmetaphorical gestalts. That is, the experiential gestalt that is superimposed in the situation via the metaphor picks out elements of the situation as fitting its dimensions—it picks out its own participants, parts, stages, etc. These are what the metaphor highlights, and what is not highlighted is downplayed or hidden.



Since new metaphors highlight things not usually highlighted by our normal conceptual structure, they have become the most celebrated examples of highlighting.



Interactional properties:  All of the dimensions of our experience are interactional in nature, and all experiential gestalts involve interactional properties. This holds for both metaphorical and nonmetaphorical concepts.



Prototypes:  Both metaphorical and nonmetaphorical categories are structured in terms of prototypes.







Truth Is Based on Understanding







We have seen that the same eight aspects of our conceptual system that go into direct immediate understanding of situations play parallel roles in indirect understanding. These aspects of our normal conceptual system are used whether we are understanding a situation in metaphorical or nonmetaphorical terms. It is because we understand  situations  in terms of our conceptual system that we can understand  statements  using that system of concepts as being  true , that is, as fitting or not fitting the situation as we understand it. Truth is therefore a function of our conceptual system. It is because many of our concepts are metaphorical in nature, and because we understand situations in terms of those concepts, that metaphors can be true or false.



The Nature of the Experientialist Account of Truth







We understand a statement as being true in a given situation when our understanding of the statement fits our understanding of the situation closely enough for our purposes.





This is the foundation of our experientialist theory of truth, which has the following characteristics.

First, our theory has some elements in common with a  correspondence  theory. According to the most rudimentary correspondence view, a statement has an objective meaning, which specifies the conditions under which it is true. Truth consists of a direct fit (or correspondence) between a statement and some state of affairs in the world.

We reject such a simplistic picture, primarily because it ignores the way in which truth is based on understanding. The experientialist view we are proposing is a correspondence theory in the following sense:



A theory of truth is a theory of what it means to understand a statement as true or false in a certain situation.



Any correspondence between what we say and some state of affairs in the world is always mediated by our understanding of the statement and of the state of affairs. Of course, our understanding of the situation results from our interaction with the situation itself. But we are able to make true (or false) statements about the world because it is possible for  our understanding of a statement  to fit (or not fit)  our understanding of the situation  in which the statement is made.



Since we understand situations and statements in terms of our conceptual system, truth for us is always relative to that conceptual system. Likewise, since an understanding is always partial, we have no access to "the whole truth" or to any definitive account of reality.



Second, understanding something requires fitting it into a coherent scheme, relative to a conceptual system. Thus, truth will always depend partly on coherence. This gives us elements of a  coherence theory.

Third, understanding also requires a grounding in experience. On the experientialist view, our conceptual system emerges from our constant successful functioning in our physical and cultural environment. Our categories of experience and the dimensions out of which they are constructed not only have emerged from our experience but are constantly being tested through ongoing successful functioning by all the members of our culture. This gives us elements of a  pragmatic theory.

Fourth, the experientialist theory of truth has some elements in common with classical  realism , but these do not include its insistence on absolute truth. Instead, it takes as given that:



The physical world is what it is. Cultures are what they are. People are what they are.



People successfully interact in their physical and cultural environments. They are constantly interacting with the real world.



Human categorization is constrained by reality, since it is characterized in terms of natural dimensions of experience that are constantly tested through physical and cultural interaction.



Classical realism focuses on physical reality rather than cultural and personal reality. But social, political, economic, and religious institutions and the human beings who function within them are no less real than trees, tables, or rocks. Since our account of truth deals with social and personal reality as well as physical reality, it can be considered an attempt to extend the realist tradition.



The experientialist theory varies from classical objective realism in the following basic way: Human concepts do not correspond to inherent properties of things but only to interactional properties. This is natural, since concepts can be metaphorical in nature and can vary from culture to culture.



Fifth, people with very different conceptual systems than our own may understand the world in a very different way than we do. Thus, they may have a very different body of truths than we have and even different criteria for truth and reality.

It should be obvious from this description that there is nothing radically new in our account of truth. It includes some of the central insights of the phenomenological tradition, such as the rejection of epistemological foundationalism, the stress on the centrality of the body in the structuring of our experience, and the importance of that structure in understanding. Our view also accords with some of the key elements of Wittgenstein's later philosophy: the family-resemblance account of categorization, the rejection of the picture theory of meaning, the rejection of a building-block theory of meaning, and the emphasis on meaning as relative to context and to one's own conceptual system.



Elements of Human Understanding in Theories of "Objective Truth"





A theory of truth based on understanding is obviously not a theory of "purely objective truth." We do not believe that there is such a thing as absolute truth, and we think that it is pointless to try to give a theory of it. However, it is traditional in Western philosophy to assume that absolute truth is possible and to undertake to give an account of it. We would like to point out how the most prominent contemporary approaches to the problem build in aspects of human understanding, which they claim to exclude.

The most obvious case is the account of truth given within model-theoretic approaches, say, for example, those done within the Kripke and Montague traditions. The models are constructed out of a universe of discourse that is taken to be a set of  entities.  Relative to this set of entities, we can define world states, in which all the properties that the entities have and all the relations among them are specified. It is assumed that this concept of a world state is sufficiently general to apply to any conceivable situation, including the real world. In such a system, sentences like "The fog is in front of the mountain" would present no problem, since there would be an entity corresponding to  the fog,  an entity corresponding to  the mountain,  and a relation  in front of,  relating the two entities. But such models do not correspond to the world in itself, free of human understanding, since there are in the world no well-defined entities corresponding to  the mountain  and  the fog  and there is no inherent  front  to the mountain. The entity structure and the front-back orientation are imposed by virtue of human understanding. Any attempt to give an account of the truth of "The fog is in front of the mountain" in such model-theoretic terms will not be an account  of objective, absolute  truth, since it involves building elements of human understanding into the models.

The same can be said of attempts to provide a theory of truth meeting the constraints of the classic Tarski truth definition:



"S"  is true if and only if  S ...



or more up-to-date versions like:



"S" is true if and only if ρ (where ρ is a statement in some universally applicable logical language)



The prototype for such theories, the well-worn



"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white.



seems reasonable enough, since there could reasonably be thought to be a sense in which snow is objectively identifiable and in which it is inherently white. But what about



"The fog is in front of the mountain" is true if and only if the fog is in front of the mountain.



Since the world does not contain clearly identifiable entities  the fog  and  the mountain , and since mountains don't have inherent fronts, the theory can work only relative to some human understanding of what a front is for a mountain and to some delineation of  fog  and  mountain . The problem is even trickier, since not all human beings have the same way of projecting fronts onto mountains. Here some elements of human understanding must be brought in to make the truth definition work.

There is another important difference between our account of truth in terms of understanding and the standard attempts to give an account of truth free of human understanding. The different accounts of truth give rise to different accounts of meaning. For us, meaning depends on understanding. A sentence can't mean anything to you unless you understand it. Moreover, meaning is always meaning  to  someone. There is no such thing as a meaning of a sentence in itself, independent of any people. When we speak of the meaning of a sentence, it is always the meaning of the sentence to someone, a real person or a hypothetical typical member of a speech community.

Here our theory differs radically from standard theories of meaning. The standard theories assume that it is possible to give an account of truth in itself, free of human understanding, and that the theory of meaning will be based on such a theory of truth. We see no possibility for any such program to work and think that the only answer is to base both the theory of meaning and the theory of truth on a theory of understanding. Metaphor, both conventional and nonconventional, plays a central role in such a program. Metaphors are basically devices for understanding and have little to do with objective reality, if there is such a thing. The fact that our conceptual system is inherently metaphorical, the fact that we understand the world, think, and function in metaphorical terms, and the fact that metaphors can not merely be understood but can be meaningful and true as well—these facts all suggest that an adequate account of meaning and truth can only be based on understanding.
