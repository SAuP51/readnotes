Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! By Feynman, Richard

## Introduction

I hope these won’t be the only memoirs of Richard Feynman. Certainly the reminiscences here give a true picture of much of his character–his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles, his provocative mischievousness, his indignant impatience with pretension and hypocrisy, and his talent for one-upping anybody who tries to one-up him! This book is great reading: outrageous, shocking, still warm and very human.

For all that, it only skirts the keystone of his life: science. We see it here and there, as background material in one sketch or another, but never as the focus of his existence, which generations of his students and colleagues know it to be. Perhaps nothing else is possible. There may be no way to construct such a series of delightful stories about himself and his work: the challenge and frustration, the excitement that caps insight, the deep pleasure of scientific understanding that has been the wellspring of happiness in his life.

I remember when I was his student how it was when you walked into one of his lectures. He would be standing in front of the hall smiling at us all as we came in, his fingers tapping out a complicated rhythm on the black top of the demonstration bench that crossed the front of the lecture hall. As latecomers took their seats, he picked up the chalk and began spinning it rapidly through his fingers in a manner of a professional gambler playing with a poker chip, still smiling happily as if at some secret joke. And then–still smiling–he talked to us about physics, his diagrams and equations helping us to share his understanding. It was no secret joke that brought the smile and the sparkle in his eye, it was physics. The joy of physics! The joy was contagious. We are fortunate who caught that infection. Now here is _your_ opportunity to be exposed to the joy of life in the style of Feynman.

Some facts about my timing: I was born in 1918 in a small town called Far Rockawav, right on the outskirts of New York, near the sea. I lived there until 1935, when I was seventeen. I went to MIT for four years, and then I went to Princeton, in about 1939. During the time I was at Princeton I started to work on the Manhattan Project, and I ultimately went to Los Alamos in April 1943, until something like October or November 1946, when I went to Cornell.

I got married to Arlene in 1941, and she died of tuberculosis while I was at Los Alamos, in 1946.

I was at Cornell until about 1951. I visited Brazil in the summer of 1949 and spent half a year there in 1951, and then went to Caltech, where I’ve been ever since.

I went to Japan at the end of 1951 for a couple of weeks, and then again, a year or two later, just after I married my second wife, Mary Lou.

I am now married to Gweneth, who is English, and we have two children, Carl and Michelle.

From Far Rockaway to MIT

—————————- He Fixes Radios by Thinking! —————————-

When I was about eleven or twelve I set up a lab in my house. It consisted of an old wooden packing box that I put shelves in. I had a heater, and I’d put in fat and cook french-fried potatoes all the time. I also had a storage battery, and a lamp bank.

To build the lamp bank I went down to the five-and-ten and got some sockets you can screw down to a wooden base, and connected them with pieces of bell wire. By making different combinations of switches–in series or parallel–I knew I could get different voltages. But what I hadn’t realized was that a bulb’s resistance depends on its temperature, so the results of my calculations weren’t the same as the stuff that came out of the circuit. But it was all right, and when the bulbs were in series, all half-lit, they would _gloooooooooow_, very pretty–it was great!

I had a fuse in the system so if I shorted anything, the fuse would blow. Now I had to have a fuse that was weaker than the fuse in the house, so I made my own fuses by taking tin foil and wrapping it around an old burnt-out fuse. Across my fuse I had a five-watt bulb, so when my fuse blew, the load from the trickle charger that was always charging the storage battery would light up the bulb. The bulb was on the switchboard behind a piece of brown candy paper (it looks red when a light’s behind it)–so if something went off, I’d look up to the switchboard and there would be a big red spot where the fuse went. It was _fun_!

I enjoyed radios. I started with a crystal set that I bought at the store, and I used to listen to it at night in bed while I was going to sleep, through a pair of earphones. When my mother and father went out until late at night, they would come into my room and take the earphones off–and worry about what was going into my head while I was asleep.

About that time I invented a burglar alarm, which was a very simple-minded thing: it was just a big battery and a bell connected with some wire. When the door to my room opened, it pushed the wire against the battery and closed the circuit, and the bell would go off.

One night my mother and father came home from a night out and very, very quietly, so as not to disturb the child, opened the door to come into my room to take my earphones off. All of a sudden this tremendous bell went off with a helluva racket–BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG!!! I jumped out of bed yelling,「It worked! It worked!」

I had a Ford coil–a spark coil from an automobile–and I had the spark terminals at the top of my switchboard. I would put a Raytheon RH tube, which had argon gas in it, across the terminals, and the spark would make a purple glow inside the vacuum–it was just great!

One day I was playing with the Ford coil, punching holes in paper with the sparks, and the paper caught on fire. Soon I couldn’t hold it any more because it was burning near my fingers, so I dropped it in a metal wastebasket which had a lot of newspapers in it. Newspapers burn fast, you know, and the flame looked pretty big inside the room. I shut the door so my mother–who was playing bridge with some friends in the living room–wouldn’t find out there was a fire in my room, took a magazine that was lying nearby, and put it over the wastebasket to smother the fire.

After the fire was out I took the magazine off, but now the room began to fill up with smoke. The wastebasket was still too hot to handle, so I got a pair of pliers, carried it across the room, and held it out the window for the smoke to blow out.

But because it was breezy outside, the wind lit the fire again, and now the magazine was out of reach. So I pulled the flaming wastebasket back in through the window to get the magazine, and I noticed there were curtains in the window–it was very dangerous!

Well, I got the magazine, put the fire out again, and this time kept the magazine with me while I shook the glowing coals out of the wastepaper basket onto the street, two or three floors below. Then I went out of my room, closed the door behind me, and said to my mother,「I’m going out to play,」and the smoke went out slowly through the windows.

I also did some things with electric motors and built an amplifier for a photo cell that I bought that could make a bell ring when I put my hand in front of the cell. I didn’t get to do as much as I wanted to, because my mother kept putting me out all the time, to play. But I was often in the house, fiddling with my lab.

I bought radios at rummage sales. I didn’t have any money, but it wasn’t very expensive-they were old, broken radios, and I’d buy them and try to fix them. Usually they were broken in some simple-minded way–some obvious wire was hanging loose, or a coil was broken or partly unwound–so I could get some of them going. On one of these radios one night I got WACO in Waco, Texas–it was tremendously exciting!

On this same tube radio up in my lab I was able to hear a station up in Schenectady called WGN. Now, all of us kids– my two cousins, my sister, and the neighborhood kids–listened on the radio downstairs to a program called the Eno Crime Club–Eno effervescent salts–it was _the_ thing! Well, I discovered that I could hear this program up in my lab on WGN one hour before it was broadcast in New York! So I’d discover what was going to happen, and then, when we were all sitting around the radio downstairs listening to the Eno Crime Club, I’d say,「You know, we haven’t heard from so-and-so in a long time. I betcha he comes and saves the situation.」

Two seconds later, _bup-bup_, he comes! So they all got excited about this, and I predicted a couple of other things. Then they realized that there must be some trick to it–that I must know, somehow. So I owned up to what it was, that I could hear it upstairs the hour before.

You know what the result was, naturally. Now they couldn’t wait for the regular hour, They all had to sit upstairs in my lab with this little creaky radio for half an hour, listening to the Eno Crime Club from Schenectady.

We lived at that time in a big house; it was left by my grandfather to his children, and they didn’t have much money aside from the house. It was a very large, wooden house, and I would run wires all around the outside, and had plugs in all the rooms, so I could always listen to my radios, which were upstairs in my lab. I also had a loudspeaker–not the whole speaker, but the part without the big horn on it.

One day, when I had my earphones on, I connected them to the loudspeaker, and I discovered something: I put my finger in the speaker and I could hear it in the earphones; I scratched the speaker and I’d hear it in the earphones. So I discovered that the speaker could act like a microphone, and you didn’t even need any batteries. At school we were talking about Alexander Graham Bell, so I gave a demonstration of the speaker and the earphones. I didn’t know it at the time, but I think it was the type of telephone he originally used.

So now I had a microphone, and I could broadcast from upstairs to downstairs, and from downstairs to upstairs, using the amplifiers of my rummage-sale radios. At that time my sister Joan, who was nine years younger than I was, must have been about two or three, and there was a guy on the radio called Uncle Don that she liked to listen to. He’d sing little songs about「good children,」and so on, and he’d read cards sent in by parents telling that「Mary So-and-so is having a birthday this Saturday at 25 Flatbush Avenue.」

One day my cousin Francis and I sat Joan down and said that there was a special program she should listen to. Then we ran upstairs and we started to broadcast:「This is Uncle Don. We know a very nice little girl named Joan who lives on New Broadway; she’s got a birthday coming–not today, but such-and-such. She’s a cute girl.」We sang a little song, and then we made music:「_Deedle leet deet, doodle doodle loot doot; deedle deedle leet, doodle loot doot doo_ We went through the whole deal, and then we came downstairs:「How was it? Did you like the program?」

「It was good,」she said,「but why did you make the music with your mouth?」

One day I got a telephone call:「Mister, are you Richard Feynman ?」

「Yes.」

「This is a hotel. We have a radio that doesn’t work, and would like it repaired. We understand you might be able to do something about it.」

「But I’m only a little boy,」I said.「I don’t know how–「

「Yes, we know that, but we’d like you to come over anyway.」

It was a hotel that my aunt was running, but I didn’t know that. I went over there with–they still tell the story–a big screwdriver in my back pocket. Well, I was small, so _any_ screwdriver looked big in my back pocket.

I went up to the radio and tried to fix it. I didn’t know anything about it, but there was also a handyman at the hotel, and either he noticed, or I noticed, a loose knob on the rheostat–to turn up the volume–so that it wasn’t turning the shaft. He went off and filed something, and fixed it up so it worked.

The next radio I tried to fix didn’t work at all. That was easy: it wasn’t plugged in right. As the repair jobs got more and more complicated, I got better and better, and more elaborate. I bought myself a milliammeter in New York and converted it into a voltmeter that had different scales on it by using the right lengths (which I calculated) of very fine copper wire. It wasn’t very accurate, hut it was good enough to tell whether things were in the right ballpark at different connections in those radio sets.

The main reason people hired me was the Depression. They didn’t have any money to fix their radios, and they’d hear about this kid who would do it for less. So I’d climb on roofs to fix antennas, and all kinds of stuff. I got a series of lessons of ever-increasing difficulty. Ultimately I got some job like converting a DC set into an AC set, and it was very hard to keep the hum from going through the system, and I didn’t build it quite right. I shouldn’t have bitten that one off, but I didn’t know.

One job was really sensational. I was working at the time for a printer, and a man who knew that printer knew I was trying to get jobs fixing radios, so he sent a fellow around to the print shop to pick me up. The guy is obviously poor–his car is a complete wreck–and we go to his house which is in a cheap part of town. On the way, I say,「What’s the trouble with the radio?」

He says,「When I turn it on it makes a noise, and after a while the noise stops and everything’s all right, but I don’t like the noise at the beginning.」

I think to myself:「What the hell! If he hasn’t got any money, you’d think he could stand a little noise for a while.」

And all the time, on the way to his house, he’s saying things like,「Do you know anything about radios? How do you know about radios–you’re just a little boy!」

He’s putting me down the whole way, and I’m thinking,「So what’s the matter with him? So it makes a little noise.」

But when we got there I went over to the radio and turned it on. Little noise? _My God!_ No wonder the poor guy couldn’t stand it. The thing began to roar and wobble–WUH BUH BUH BUH BUH–A _tremendous_ amount of noise. Then it quieted down and played correctly. So I started to think:「How can that happen?」

I start walking back and forth, thinking, and I realize that one way it can happen is that the tubes are heating up in the wrong order–that is, the amplifier’s all hot, the tubes are ready to go, and there’s nothing feeding in, or there’s some back circuit feeding in, or something wrong in the beginning part–the HF part–and therefore it’s making a lot of noise, picking up something. And when the RF circuit’s finally going, and the grid voltages are adjusted, everything’s all right.

So the guy says,「What are you doing? You come to fix the radio, but you’re only walking back and forth!」

I say,「I’m thinking!」Then I said to myself,「All right, take the tubes out, and reverse the order completely in the set.」(Many radio sets in those days used the same tubes in different places–212’s, I think they were, or 212-A’s.) So I changed the tubes around, stepped to the front of the radio, turned the thing on, and it’s as quiet as a lamb: it waits until it heats up, and then plays perfectly–no noise.

When a person has been negative to you, and then you do something like that, they’re usually a hundred percent the other way, kind of to compensate. He got me other jobs, and kept telling everybody what a tremendous genius I was, saying,「He fixes radios by _thinking_!」The whole idea of thinking, to fix a radio–a little boy stops and thinks, and figures out how to do it–he never thought that was possible.

Radio circuits were much easier to understand in those days because everything was out in the open. After you took the set apart (it was a big problem to find the right screws), you could see this was a resistor, that’s a condenser, here’s a this, there’s a that; they were all labeled. And if wax had been dripping from the condenser, it was too hot and you could tell that the condenser was burned out. If there was charcoal on one of the resistors you knew where the trouble was. Or, if you couldn’t tell what was the matter by looking at it, you’d test it with your voltmeter and see whether voltage was coming through. The sets were simple, the circuits were not complicated. The voltage on the grids was always about one and a half or two volts and the voltages on the plates were one hundred or two hundred, DC. So it wasn’t hard for me to fix a radio by understanding what was going on inside, noticing that something wasn’t working right, and fixing it.

Sometimes it took quite a while. I remember one particular time when it took the whole afternoon to find a burnedout resistor that was not apparent. That particular time it happened to be a friend of my mother, so I _had_ time-there was nobody on my back saying,「What are you doing?」Instead, they were saying,「Would you like a little milk, or some cake?」I finally fixed it because I had, and still have, persistence. Once I get on a puzzle, I can’t get off. If my mother’s friend had said,「Never mind, it’s too much work,」I’d have blown my top, because I want to beat this damn thing, as long as I’ve gone this far. I can’t just leave it after I’ve found out so much about it. I have to keep going to find out ultimately what is the matter with it in the end.

That’s a puzzle drive. It’s what accounts for my wanting to decipher Mayan hieroglyphics, for trying to open safes. I remember in high school, during first period a guy would come to me with a puzzle in geometry, or something which had been assigned in his advanced math class. I wouldn’t stop until I figured the damn thing out–it would take me fifteen or twenty minutes. But during the day, other guys would come to me with the same problem, and I’d do it for them in a flash. So for one guy, to do it took me twenty minutes, while there were five guys who thought I was a super-genius.

So I got a fancy reputation. During high school every puzzle that was known to man must have come to me. Every damn, crazy conundrum that people had invented, I knew. So when I got to MIT there was a dance, and one of the seniors had his girlfriend there, and she knew a lot of puzzles, and he was telling her that I was pretty good at them. So during the dance she came over to me and said,「They say you’re a smart guy, so here’s one for you: A man has eight cords of wood to chop . . .」

And I said,「He starts by chopping every other one in three parts,」because I had heard that one.

Then she’d go away and come back with another one, and I’d always know it.

This went on for quite a while, and finally, near the end of the dance, she came over, looking as if she was going to get me for sure this time, and she said,「A mother and daughter are traveling to Europe . . .」

「The daughter got the bubonic plague.」

She collapsed! That was hardly enough clues to get the answer to that one: It was the long story about how a mother and daughter stop at a hotel and stay in separate rooms, and the next day the mother goes to the daughter’s room and there’s nobody there, or somebody else is there, and she says,「Where’s my daughter?」and the hotel keeper says,「What daughter?」and the register’s got only the mother’s name, and so on, and so on, and there’s a big mystery as to what happened. The answer is, the daughter got bubonic plague, and the hotel, not wanting to have to close up, spirits the daughter away, cleans up the room, and erases all evidence of her having been there. It was a long tale, but I had heard it, so when the girl started out with,「A mother and daughter are traveling to Europe,」I knew one thing that started that way, so I took a flying guess, and got it.

We had a thing at high school called the algebra team, which consisted of five kids, and we would travel to different schools as a team and have competitions. We would sit in one row of seats and the other team would sit in another row. A teacher, who was running the contest, would take out an envelope, and on the envelope it says「forty-five seconds.」She opens it up, writes the problem on the blackboard, and says,「Go!」–so you really have more than forty-five seconds because while she’s writing you can think. Now the game was this: You have a piece of paper, and on it you can write anything, you can do anything. The only thing that counted was the answer. If the answer was「six books,」you’d have to write「6,」and put a big circle around it. If what was in the circle was right, you won; if it wasn’t, you lost.

One thing was for sure: It was practically impossible to do the problem in any conventional, straightforward way, like putting「A is the number of red books, B is the number of blue books,」grind, grind, grind, until you get「six books.」That would take you fifty seconds, because the people who set up the timings on these problems had made them all a trifle short. So you had to think,「Is there a way to see it?」Sometimes you could see it in a flash, and sometimes you’d have to invent another way to do it and then do the algebra as fast as you could. It was wonderful practice, and I got better and better, and I eventually got to be the head of the team. So I learned to do algebra very quickly, and it came in handy in college. When we had a problem in calculus, I was very quick to see where it was going and to do the algebra–fast.

Another thing I did in high school was to invent problems and theorems. I mean, if I were doing any mathematical thing at all, I would find some practical example for which it would be useful. I invented a set of right-triangle problems. But instead of giving the lengths of two of the sides to find the third, I gave the difference of the two sides. A typical example was: There’s a flagpole, and there’s a rope that comes down from the top. When you hold the rope straight down, it’s three feet longer than the pole, and when you pull the rope out tight, it’s five feet from the base of the pole. How high is the pole?

I developed some equations for solving problems like that, and as a result I noticed some connection–perhaps it was sin2 + cos2 = 1–that reminded me of trigonometry. Now, a few years earlier, perhaps when I was eleven or twelve, I had read a book on trigonometry that I had checked out from the library, but the book was by now long gone. I remembered only that trigonometry had something to do with relations between sines and cosines. So I began to work out all the relations by drawing triangles, and each one I proved by myself. I also calculated the sine, cosine, and tangent of every five degrees, starting with the sine of five degrees as given, by addition and half-angle formulas that I had worked out.

A few years later, when we studied trigonometry in school, I still had my notes and I saw that my demonstrations were often different from those in the book. Sometimes, for a thing where I didn’t notice a simple way to do it, I went all over the place till I got it. Other times, my way was most clever–the standard demonstration in the book was much more complicated! So sometimes I had ‘em heat, and sometimes it was the other way around.

While I was doing all this trigonometry, I didn’t like the symbols for sine, cosine, tangent, and so on. To me,「sin f」looked like s times i times n times f! So I invented another symbol, like a square root sign, that was a sigma with a long arm sticking out of it, and I put the f underneath. For the tangent it was a tau with the top of the tau extended, and for the cosine I made a kind of gamma, but it looked a little bit like the square root sign.

Now the inverse sine was the same sigma, but left-to-right reflected so that it started with the horizontal line with the value underneath, and then the sigma. _That_ was the inverse sine, NOT sink f–that was crazy! They had that in books! To me, sin_i meant i/sine, the reciprocal. So my symbols were better.

I didn’t like f(x)–that looked to me like f times x. I also didn’t like dy/dx–you have a tendency to cancel the d’s–so I made a diflerent sign, something like an & sign. For logarithms it was a big L extended to the right, with the thing you take the log of inside, and so on.

I thought my symbols were just as good, if not better, than the regular symbols–it doesn’t make any difference _what_ symbols you use–but I discovered later that it _does_ make a difference. Once when I was explaining something to another kid in high school, without thinking I started to make these symbols, and he said,「What the hell are those?」I realized then that if I’m going to talk to anybody else, I’ll have to use the standard symbols, so I eventually gave up my own symbols.

I had also invented a set of symbols for the typewriter, like FORTRAN has to do, so I could type equations. I also fixed typewriters, with paper clips and rubber bands (the rubber bands didn’t break down like they do here in Los Angeles), hut I wasn’t a professional repairman; I’d just fix them so they would work. But the whole problem of discovering what was the matter, and figuring out what you have to do to fix it–that was interesting to me, like a puzzle.

———— String Beans ————

I must have been seventeen or eighteen when I worked one summer in a hotel run by my aunt. I don’t know how much I got–twenty-two dollars a month, I think–and I alternated eleven hours one day and thirteen the next as a desk clerk or as a busboy in the restaurant. And during the afternoon, when you were desk clerk, you had to bring milk up to Mrs. D–, an invalid woman who never gave us a tip. That’s the way the world was: You worked long hours and got nothing for it, every day.

This was a resort hotel, by the beach, on the outskirts of New York City. The husbands would go to work in the city and leave the wives behind to play cards, so you would always have to get the bridge tables out. Then at night the guys would play poker, so you’d get the tables ready for them–clean out the ashtrays and so on. I was always up until late at night, like two o’clock, so it really was thirteen and eleven hours a day.

There were certain things I didn’t like, such as tipping. I thought we should be paid more, and not have to have any tips. But when I proposed that to the boss, I got nothing but laughter. She told everybody,「Richard doesn’t want his tips, hee, hee, hee; he doesn’t want his tips, ha, ha, ha.」The world is full of this kind of dumb smart-alec who doesn’t understand anything.

Anyway, at one stage there was a group of men who, when they’d come back from working in the city, would right away want ice for their drinks. Now the other guy working with me had really been a desk clerk. He was older than I was, and a lot more professional. One time he said to me,「Listen, we’re always bringing ice up to that guy Ungar and he never gives us a tip–not even ten cents. Next time, when they ask for ice, just don’t do a damn thing. Then they’ll call you back, and when they call you back, you say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot. We’re all forgetful sometimes.’」

So I did it, and Ungar gave me fifteen cents! But now, when I think back on it, I realize that the other desk clerk, the professional, had _really_ known what to do–tell the _other_ guy to take the risk of getting into trouble. He put me to the job of training this fella to give tips. _He_ never said anything; he made _me_ do it!

I had to clean up tables in the dining room as a busboy. You pile all this stuff from the tables on to a tray at the side, and when it gets high enough you carry it into the kitchen. So you get a new tray, right? You _should_ do it in two steps–take the old tray away, and put in a new one-but I thought,「I’m going to do it in one step.」So I tried to slide the new tray under, and pull the old tray out at the same time, and it slipped–BANG! All the stuff went on the floor. And then, naturally, the question was,「What were you doing? How did it fall?」Well, how could I explain that I was trying to invent a new way to handle trays?

Among the desserts there was some kind of coffee cake that came out very pretty on a doily, on a little plate. But if you would go in the back you’d see a man called the pantry man. His problem was to get the stuff ready for desserts. Now this man must have been a miner, or something–heavybuilt, with very stubby, rounded, thick fingers. He’d take this stack of doilies, which are manufactured by some sort of stamping process, all stuck together, and he’d take these stubby fingers and try to separate the doilies to put them on the plates. I always heard him say,「Damn deez doilies!」while he was doing this, and I remember thinking,「What a contrast–the person sitting at the table gets this nice cake on a doilied plate, while the pantry man back there with the stubby thumbs is saying, ‘Damn deez doilies!’」So that was the difference between the real world and what it looked like.

My first day on the job the pantry lady explained that she usually made a ham sandwich, or something, for the guy who was on the late shift. I said that I liked desserts, so if there was a dessert left over from supper, I’d like that. The next night I was on the late shift till 2:00 A.M. with these guys playing poker. I was sitting around with nothing to do, getting bored, when suddenly I remembered there was a dessert to eat. I went over to the icebox and opened it up, and there she’d left _six_ desserts! There was a chocolate pudding, a piece of cake, some peach slices, some rice pudding, some jello–there was everything! So I sat there and ate the six desserts–it was sensational!

The next day she said to me,「I left a dessert for you.

「It was wonderful,」I said,「abolutely wonderful!」

「But I left you six desserts because I didn’t know which one you liked the best.」

So from that time on she left six desserts. They weren’t always different, but there were always six desserts.

One time when I was desk clerk a girl left a book by the telephone at the desk while she went to eat dinner, so I looked at. it. It was _The Life of Leonardo_, and I couldn’t resist: The girl let me borrow it and I read the whole thing.

I slept in a little room in the back of the hotel, and there was some stew about turning out the lights when you leave your room, which I couldn’t ever remember to do. Inspired by the Leonardo book, I made this gadget which consisted of a system of strings and weights–Coke bottles full of water– that would operate when I’d open the door, lighting the pull-chain light inside. You open the door, and things would go, and light the light; then you close the door behind you, and the light would go out. But my _real_ accomplishment came later.

I used to cut vegetables in the kitchen. String beans had to be cut into one-inch pieces. The way you were supposed to do it was: You hold two beans in one hand, the knife in the other, and you press the knife against the beans and your thumb, almost cutting yourself. It was a slow process. So I put my mind to it, and I got a pretty good idea. I sat down at the wooden table outside the kitchen, put a bowl in my lap, and stuck a very sharp knife into the table at a forty-five-degree angle away from me. Then I put a pile of the string beans on each side, and I’d pick out a bean, one in each hand, and bring it towards me with enough speed that it would slice, and the pieces would slide into the bowl that was in my lap.

So I’m slicing beans one after the other–_chig, chig, chig, chig, chig_–and everybody’s giving me the beans, and I’m going like sixty when the boss comes by and says,「What are you _doing_?」

I say,「Look at the way I have of cutting beans!」–and just at that moment I put a finger through instead of a bean. Blood came out and went on the beans, and there was a big excitement:「Look at how many beans you spoiled! What a stupid way to do things!」and so on. So I was never able to make any improvement, which would have been easy–with a guard, or something–but no, there was no chance for improvement.

I had another invention, which had a similar difficulty. We had to slice potatoes after they’d been cooked, for some kind of potato salad. They were sticky and wet, and difficult to handle. I thought of a whole lot of knives, parallel in a rack, coming down and slicing the whole thing. I thought about this a long time, and finally I got the idea of wires in a rack,

So I went to the five-and-ten to buy some knives or wires, and saw exactly the gadget I wanted: it was for slicing eggs. The next time the potatoes came out I got my little egg-slicer out and sliced all the potatoes in no time, and sent them back to the chef. The chef was a German, a great big guy who was King of the Kitchen, and he came storming out, blood vessels sticking out of his neck, livid red.「What’s the matter with the potatoes?」he says.「They’re not sliced!」

I had them sliced, but they were all stuck together. He says,「How can I separate them?」

「Stick ‘em in water,」I suggest.

「IN WATER? EAGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!」

Another time I had a _really_ good idea. When I was desk clerk I had to answer the telephone. When a call came in, something buzzed, and a flap came down on the switchboard so you could tell which line it was. Sometimes, when I was helping the women with the bridge tables or sitting on the front porch in the middle of the afternoon (when there were very few calls), I’d be some distance from the switchboard when suddenly it would go. I’d come running to catch it, but the way the desk was made, in order to get to the switchboard you had to go quite a distance further down, then around, in behind, and then back up to see where the call was coming from–it took extra time.

So I got a good idea. I tied threads to the flaps on the switchboard, and strung them over the top of the desk and then down, and at the end of each thread I tied a little piece of paper. Then I put the telephone talking piece up on top of the desk, so I could reach it from the front. Now, when a call came, I could tell which flap was down by which piece of paper was up, so I could answer the phone appropriately, from the front, to save time. Of course I still had to go around back to switch it in, but at least I was answering it. I’d say,「Just a moment,」and then go around to switch it in.

I thought that was perfect, but the boss came by one day, and she wanted to answer the phone, and she couldn’t figure it out–too complicated.「What are all these papers doing? Why is the telephone on this side? Why don’t you . . . _raaaaaaaa!_」

I tried to explain–it was my own aunt–that there was no reason _not_ to do that, but you can’t say that to anybody who’s _smart_, who _runs a hotel!_ I learned there that innovation is a very difficult thing in the real world.

——————- Who Stole the Door? ——————-

At MIT the different fraternities all had「smokers」where they tried to get the new freshmen to be their pledges, and the summer before I went to MIT I was invited to a meeting in New York of Phi Beta Delta, a Jewish fraternity. In those days, if you were Jewish or brought up in a Jewish family, you didn’t have a chance in any other fraternity. Nobody else would look at you. I wasn’t particularly looking to be with other Jews, and the guys from the Phi Beta Delta fraternity didn’t care how Jewish I was–in fact, I didn’t believe anything about that stuff, and was certainly not in any way religious. Anyway, some guys from the fraternity asked me some questions and gave me a little bit of advice–that I ought to take the first-year calculus exam so I wouldn’t have to take the course-which turned out to be good advice. I liked the fellas who came down to New York from the fraternity, and the two guys who talked me into it, I later became their roommate.

There was another Jewish fraternity at MIT, called「SAM,」and their idea was to give me a ride up to Boston and I could stay with them. I accepted the ride, and stayed upstairs in one of the rooms that first night.

The next morning I looked out the window and saw the two guys from the other fraternity (that I met in New York) walking up the steps. Some guys from the Sigma Alpha Mu ran out to talk to them and there was a big discussion.

I yelled out the window,「Hey, I’m supposed to be with _those_ guys!」and I rushed out of the fraternity without realizing that they were all operating, competing for my pledge. I didn’t have any feelings of gratitude for the ride, or anything.

The Phi Beta Delta fraternity had almost collapsed the year before, because there were two different cliques that had split the fraternity in half. There was a group of socialite characters, who liked to have dances and fool around in their cars afterwards, and so on, and there was a group of guys who did nothing but study, and never went to the dances.

Just before I came to the fraternity they had had a big meeting and had made an important compromise. They were going to get together and help each other out. Everyone had to have a grade level of at least such-and-such. If they were sliding behind, the guys who studied all the time would teach them and help them do their work. On the other side, everybody had to go to every dance. If a guy didn’t know how to get a date, the other guys would _get_ him a date. If the guy didn’t know how to dance, they’d _teach_ him to dance. One group was teaching the other how to think, while the other guys were teaching them how to be social.

That was just right for me, because I was _not_ very good socially. I was so timid that when I had to take the mail out and walk past some seniors sitting on the steps with some girls, I was petrified: I didn’t know how to walk past them! And it didn’t help any when a girl would say,「Oh, he’s cute!」

It was only a little while after that the sophomores brought their girlfriends and their girlfriends’ friends over to teach us to dance. Much later, one of the guys taught me how to drive his car. They worked very hard to get us intellectual characters to socialize and be more relaxed, and vice versa. It was a good balancing out.

I had some difficulty understanding what exactly it meant to be「social.」Soon after these social guys had taught me how to meet girls, I saw a nice waitress in a restaurant where I was eating by myself one day. With great effort I finally got up enough nerve to ask her to be my date at the next fraternity dance, and she said yes.

Back at the fraternity, when we were talking about the dates for the next dance, I told the guys I didn’t need a date this time–I had found one on my own. I was very proud of myself.

When the upperclassmen found out my date was a waitress, they were horrified. They told me that was not possible; they would get me a「proper」date. They made me feel as though I had strayed, that I was amiss. They decided to take over the situation. They went to the restaurant, found the waitress, talked her out of it, and got me another girl. They were trying to educate their「wayward son,」so to speak, but they were wrong, I think. I was only a freshman then, and I didn’t have enough confidence yet to stop them from breaking my date.

When I became a pledge they had various ways of hazing. One of the things they did was to take us, blindfolded, far out into the countryside in the dead of winter and leave us by a frozen lake about a hundred feet apart. We were in the middle of absolutely _nowhere_–no houses, no nothing–and we were supposed to find our way back to the fraternity. We were a little bit scared, because we were young, and we didn’t say much–except for one guy, whose name was Maurice Meyer: you couldn’t stop him from joking around, making dumb puns, and having this happy-go-lucky attitude of「Ha, ha, there’s nothing to worry about. Isn’t this fun!」

We were getting mad at Maurice. He was always walking a little bit behind and laughing at the whole situation, while the rest of us didn’t know how we were ever going to get out of this.

We came to an intersection not far from the lake–there were still no houses or anything–and the rest of us were discussing whether we should go this way or that way, when Maurice caught up to us and said,「Go _this_ way.」

「What the hell do _you_ know, Maurice?」we said, frustrated.「You’re always making these jokes. Why should we go _this_ way?」

「Simple: Look at the telephone lines. Where there’s more wires, it’s going toward the central station.」

This guy, who looked like he wasn’t paying attention to anything, had come up with a terrific idea! We walked straight into town without making an error.

On the following day there was going to be a schoolwide freshman versus sophomore mudeo (various forms of wrestling and tug of wars that take place in the mud). Late in the evening, into our fraternity comes a whole bunch of sophomores–some from our fraternity and some from outside– and they kidnap us: they want us to be tired the next day so they can win.

The sophomores tied up all the freshmen relatively easily–except me. I didn’t want the guys in the fraternity to find out that I was a「sissy.」(I was never any good in sports. I was always terrified if a tennis ball would come over the fence and land near me, because I never could get it over the fence-it usually went about a radian off of where it was supposed to go.) I figured this was a new situation, a new world, and I could make a new reputation. So in order that I wouldn’t look like I didn’t know how to fight, I fought like a son of a gun as best I could (not knowing what I was doing), and it took three or four guys many tries before they were finally able to tie me up. The sophomores took us to a house, far away in the woods, and tied us all down to a wooden floor with big U tacks.

I tried all sorts of ways to escape, but there were sophomores guarding us, and none of my tricks worked. I remember distinctly one young man they were afraid to tie down because he was so terrified: his face was pale yellowgreen and he was shaking. I found out later he was from Europe-this was in the early thirties–and he didn’t realize that these guys all tied down to the floor was some kind of a joke; he knew what kinds of things were going on in Europe. The guy was frightening to look at, he was so scared.

By the time the night was over, there were only three sophomores guarding twenty of us freshmen, but we didn’t know that. The sophomores had driven their cars in and out a few times to make it sound as if there was a lot of activity, and we didn’t notice it was always the same cars and the same people. So we didn’t win that one.

My father and mother happened to come up that morning to see how their son was doing in Boston, and the fraternity kept putting them off until we came back from being kidnapped. I was so bedraggled and dirty from struggling so hard to escape and from lack of sleep that they were really horrified to discover what their son looked like at MIT!

I had also gotten a stiff neck, and I remember standing in line for inspection that afternoon at ROTC, not being able to look straight forward. The commander grabbed my head and turned it, shouting,「Straighten up!」

I winced, as my shoulders went at an angle:「I can’t help it, sir!

「Oh, excuse _me_!」he said, apologetically.

Anyway, the fact that I fought so long and hard not to be tied up gave me a terrific reputation, and I never had to worry about that sissy business again–a tremendous relief.

I often listened to my roommates–they were both seniors–studying for their theoretical physics course. One day they were working pretty hard on something that seemed pretty clear to me, so I said,「Why don’t you use the Baronallai’s equation?」

「What’s that!」they exclaimed.「What are you talking about!」

I explained to them what I meant and how it worked in this case, and it solved the problem. It turned out it was Bernoulli’s equation that I meant, but I had read all this stuff in the encyclopedia without talking to anybody about it, so I didn’t know how to pronounce anything.

But my roommates were very excited, and from then on they discussed their physics problems with me–I wasn’t so lucky with many of them–and the next year, when I took the course, I advanced rapidly. That was a very good way to get educated, working on the senior problems and learning how to pronounce things.

I liked to go to a place called the Raymor and Playmore Ballroom–two ballrooms that were connected together–on Tuesday nights. My fraternity brothers didn’t go to these「open」dances; they preferred their own dances, where the girls they brought were upper crust ones they had met「properly.」I didn’t care, when I met somebody, where they were from, or what their background was, so I would go to these dances–even though my fraternity brothers disapproved (I was a junior by this time, and they couldn’t stop me)–and I had a very good time.

One time I danced with a certain girl a few times, and didn’t say much. Finally, she said to me,「Who hants vewwy nice-ee.」

I couldn’t quite make it out–she had some difficulty in speech–but I thought she said,「You dance very nicely.」

「Thank you,」I said.「It’s been an honor.」

We went over to a table where a friend of hers had found a boy she was dancing with and we sat, the four of us, together. One girl was very hard of hearing, and the other girl was nearly deaf.

When the two girls conversed they would do a large amount of signaling very rapidly back and forth, and grunt a little bit. It didn’t bother me; the girl danced well, and she was a nice person.

After a few more dances, we’re sitting at the table again, and there’s a large amount of signaling back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, until finally she says something to me which I gathered means, she’d like us to take them to some hotel.

I ask the other guy if he wants to go.

「What do they want us to go to this hotel for?」he asks.

「Hell, I don’t know. We didn’t talk well enough!」But I don’t _have_ to know. It’s just fun, seeing what’s going to happen; it’s an adventure!

The other guy’s afraid, so he says no. So I take the two girls in a taxi to the hotel, and discover that there’s a dance organized by the deaf and dumb, believe it or not. They all belonged to a club. It turns out many of them can feel the rhythm enough to dance to the music and applaud the band at the end of each number.

It was very, very interesting! I felt as if I was in a foreign country and couldn’t speak the language: I could speak, but nobody could hear me. Everybody was talking with signs to everybody else, and I couldn’t understand anything! I asked my girl to teach me some signs and I learned a few, like you learn a foreign language, just for fun.

Everyone was so happy and relaxed with each other, making jokes and smiling all the time; they didn’t seem to have any real difficulty of any kind communicating with each other. It was the same as with any other language, except for one thing: as they’re making signs to each other, their heads were always turning from one side to the other. I realized what that was. When someone wants to make a side remark or interrupt you, he can’t yell,「Hey, Jack!」He can only make a signal, which you won’t catch unless you’re in the habit of looking around all the time.

They were completely comfortable with each other. It was _my_ problem to be comfortable. It was a wonderful experience.

The dance went on for a long time, and when it closed down we went to a cafeteria. They were all ordering things by pointing to them. I remember somebody asking in signs,「Where-are-you-from?」and my girl spelling out「N-e-w Y-o-r-k.」I still remember a guy signing to me「Good sport!」–he holds his thumb up, and then touches an imaginary lapel, for「sport.」It’s a nice system.

Everybody was sitting around, making jokes, and getting me into their world very nicely. I wanted to buy a bottle of milk, so I went up to the guy at the counter and mouthed the word「milk」without saying anything.

The guy didn’t understand.

I made the symbol for「milk,」which is two fists moving as if you’re milking a cow, and he didn’t catch that either.

I tried to point to the sign that showed the price of milk, but he still didn’t catch on.

Finally, some stranger nearby ordered milk, and I pointed to it.

「Oh! Milk!」he said, as I nodded my head yes.

He handed me the bottle, and I said,「Thank you very much!」

「You SON of a GUN!」he said, smiling.

I often liked to play tricks on people when I was at MIT. One time, in mechanical drawing class, some joker picked up a French curve (a piece of plastic for drawing smooth curves–a curly, funny-looking thing) and said,「I wonder if the curves on this thing have some special formula?」

I thought for a moment and said,「Sure they do. The curves are very special curves. Lemme show ya,」and I picked up my French curve and began to turn it slowly.「The French curve is made so that at the lowest point on each curve, no matter how you turn it, the tangent is horizontal.」

All the guys in the class were holding their French curve up at different angles, holding their pencil up to it at the lowest point and laying it along, and discovering that, sure enough, the tangent is horizontal. They were all excited by this「discovery」–even though they had already gone through a certain amount of calculus and had already「learned」that the derivative (tangent) of the minimum (lowest point) of _any_ curve is zero (horizontal). They didn’t put two and two together. They didn’t even know what they「knew.」

I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way–by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!

I did the same kind of trick four years later at Princeton when I was talking with an experienced character, an assistant of Einstein, who was surely working with gravity all the time. I gave him a problem: You blast off in a rocket which has a clock on board, and there’s a clock on the ground. The idea is that you have to be back when the clock on the ground says one hour has passed. Now you want it so that when you come back, your clock is as far ahead as possible. According to Einstein, if you go very high, your clock will go faster, because the higher something is in a gravitational field, the faster its clock goes. But if you try to go too high, since you’ve only got an hour, you have to go so fast to get there that the speed slows your clock down. So you can’t go too high. The question is, exactly what program of speed and height should you make so that you get the maximum time on your clock?

This assistant of Einstein worked on it for quite a bit before he realized that the answer is the real motion of matter. If you shoot something up in a normal way, so that the time it takes the shell to go up and come down is an hour, that’s the correct motion. It’s the fundamental principle of Einstein’s gravity–that is, what’s called the「proper time」is at a maximum for the actual curve. But when I put it to him, about a rocket with a clock, he didn’t recognize it. It was just like the guys in mechanical drawing class, but this time it wasn’t dumb freshmen. So this kind of fragility is, in fact, fairly common, even with more learned people.

When I was a junior or senior I used to eat at a certain restaurant in Boston. I went there by myself, often on successive evenings. People got to know me, and I had the same waitress all the time.

I noticed that they were always in a hurry, rushing around, so one day, just for fun, I left my tip, which was usually ten cents (normal for those days), in two nickels, under two glasses: I filled each glass to the very top, dropped a nickel in, and with a card over it, turned it over so it was upside down on the table. Then I slipped out the card (no water leaks out because no air can come in–the rim is too close to the table for that).

I put the tip under two glasses because I knew they were always in a hurry. If the tip was a dime in one glass, the waitress, in her haste to get the table ready for the next customer, would pick up the glass, the water would spill out, and that would be the end of it. But after she does that with the first glass, what the hell is she going to do with the second one? She can’t just have the nerve to lift it up now!

On the way out I said to my waitress,「Be careful, Sue. There’s something funny about the glasses you gave me– they’re filled in on the top, and there’s a hole on the bottom!」

The next day I came back, and I had a new waitress. My regular waitress wouldn’t have anything to do with me.「Sue’s very angry at you,」my new waitress said.「After she picked up the first glass and water went all over the place, she called the boss out. They studied it a little bit, but they couldn’t spend all day figuring out what to do, so they finally picked up the other one, and water went out _again_, all over the floor. It was a terrible mess; Sue slipped later in the water. They’re _all_ mad at you.」

I laughed.

She said,「It’s not funny! How would _you_ like it if someone did that to you–what would _you_ do?」

「I’d get a soup plate and then slide the glass very carefully over to the edge of the table, and let the water run into the soup plate–it doesn’t have to run onto the floor. Then I’d take the nickel out.」

「Oh, that’s a goood idea,」she said.

That evening I left my tip under a coffee cup, which I left upside down on the table.

The next night I came and I had the same new waitress.

「What’s the idea of leaving the cup upside down last time?」

「Well, I thought that even though you were in a hurry, you’d have to go back into the kitchen and get a soup plate; then you’d have to _sloooowly_ and carefully slide the cup over to the edge of the table . . .」

「I _did_ that,」she complained,「but there was no _water_ in it!」

My masterpiece of mischief happened at the fraternity. One morning I woke up very early, about five o’clock, and couldn’t go back to sleep, so I went downstairs from the sleeping rooms and discovered some signs hanging on strings which said things like「DOOR! DOOR! WHO STOLE THE DOOR?」I saw that someone had taken a door off its hinges, and in its place they hung a sign that said,「PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR!」–the sign that used to be on the door that was missing.

I immediately figured out what the idea was. In that room a guy named Pete Bernays and a couple of other guys liked to work very hard, and always wanted it quiet. If you wandered into their room looking for something, or to ask them how they did problem such and such, when you would leave you would always hear these guys scream,「Please close the door!」

Somebody had gotten tired of this, no doubt, and had taken the door off. Now this room, it so happened, had two doors, the way it was built, so I got an idea: I took the other door off its hinges, carried it downstairs, and hid it in the basement behind the oil tank. Then I quietly went back upstairs and went to bed.

Later in the morning I made believe I woke up and came downstairs a little late. The other guys were milling around, and Pete and his friends were all upset: The doors to their room were missing, and they had to study, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was coming down the stairs and they said,「Feynman! Did you take the doors?」

「Oh, yeah!」I said.「I took the door. You can see the scratches on my knuckles here, that I got when my hands scraped against the wall as I was carrying it down into the basement.」

They weren’t satisfied with my answer; in fact, they didn’t believe me.

The guys who took the first door had left so many clues–the handwriting on the signs, for instance–that they were soon found out. My idea was that when it was found out who stole the first door, everybody would think they also stole the other door. It worked perfectly: The guys who took the first door were pummeled and tortured and worked on by everybody, until finally, with much pain and difficulty, they convinced their tormentors that they had only taken one door, unbelievable as it might be.

I listened to all this, and I was happy.

The other door stayed missing for a whole week, and it became more and more important to the guys who were trying to study in that room that the other door be found.

Finally, in order to solve the problem, the president of the fraternity says at the dinner table,「We have to solve this problem of the other door. I haven’t been able to solve the problem myself, so I would like suggestions from the rest of you as to how to straighten this out, because Pete and the others are trying to study.」

Somebody makes a suggestion, then someone else.

After a little while, I get up and make a suggestion.「All right,」I say in a sarcastic voice,「whoever you are who stole the door, we know you’re wonderful. You’re so _clever_! We can’t figure out _who_ you are, so you must be some sort of super-genius. You don’t have to tell us who you are; all we want to know is where the door is. So if you will leave a note somewhere, telling us where the door is, we will honor you and admit _forever_ that you are a super-marvel, that you are so _smart_ that you could take the other door without our being able to figure out who you are. But for God’s sake, just leave the note somewhere, and we will be forever grateful to you for it.」

The next guy makes his suggestion:「I have another idea,」he says.「I think that you, as president, should ask each man on his word of honor towards the fraternity to say whether he took the door or not.」

The president says,「That’s a _very_ good idea. On the fraternity word of honor!」So he goes around the table, and asks each guy, one by one:「Jack, did _you_ take the door?」

「No, sir, I did not take the door.」

「Tim: Did _you_ take the door?」

「No, sir! I did not take the door!」

「Maurice. Did _you_ take the door?」

「No, I did not take the door, sir.」

「Feynman, did _you_ take the door?」

「Yeah, _I_ took the door.」

「Cut it out, Feynman; this is _serious_! Sam! Did _you_ take the door . . .」–it went all the way around. Everyone was _shocked_. There must be some real _rat_ in the fraternity who didn’t respect the fraternity word of honor!

That night I left a note with a little picture of the oil tank and the door next to it, and the next day they found the door and put it back.

Sometime later I finally admitted to taking the other door, and I was accused by everybody of lying. They couldn’t remember what I had said. All they could remember was their conclusion after the president of the fraternity had gone around the table and asked everybody, that nobody admitted taking the door. The idea they remembered, but not the words.

People often think I’m a faker, but I’m usually honest, in a certain way–in such a way that often nobody believes me!

—————– Latin or Italian? —————–

There was an Italian radio station in Brooklyn, and as a boy I used to listen to it all the time. I LOVed the ROLLing SOUNds going over me, as if I was in the ocean, and the waves weren’t very high. I used to sit there and have the water come over me, in this BEAUtiful iTALian. In the Italian programs there was always some kind of family situation where there were discussions and arguments between the mother and father: High voice:「_Nio teco TIEto capeto TUtto_ . . .」

Loud, low voice:「_DRO tone pala TUtto!!_」(with hand slapping).

It was great! So I learned to make all these emotions: I could cry; I could laugh; all this stuff. Italian is a lovely language.

There were a number of Italian people living near us in New York. Once while I was riding my bicycle, some Italian truck driver got upset at me, leaned out of his truck, and, gesturing, yelled something like,「_Me aRRUcha LAMpe etta Tiche!_」

I felt like a crapper. What did he say to me? What should I yell back?

So I asked an Italian friend of mine at school, and he said,「Just say, ‘_A te! A te!_’–which means ‘The same to you! The same to you!」

I thought it was a great idea. I would say ‘_A te! A te!_」back–gesturing, of course. Then, as I gained confidence, I developed my abilities further. I would be riding my bicycle, and some lady would be driving in her car and get in the way, and I’d say,「_PUzzia a la maLOche!_」–and she’d shrink! Some terrible Italian boy had cursed a terrible curse at her!

It was not so easy to recognize it as fake Italian. Once, when I was at Princeton, as I was going into the parking lot at Palmer Laboratory on my bicycle, somebody got in the way.

My habit was always the same: I gesture to the guy,「_oREzze caB ONca MIche!_」, slapping the back of one hand against the other.

And way up on the other side of a long area of grass, there’s an Italian gardner putting in some plants. He stops, waves, and shouts happily,「_REzza ma LIa!_」

I call back,「_RONte BALta!_」, returning the greeting. He didn’t know I didn’t know, and I didn’t know what he said, and he didn’t know what I said. But it was OK! It was great! It works! Afrer all, when they hear the intonation, they recognize it immediately as Italian–maybe it’s Milano instead of Romano, what the hell. But he’s an iTALian! So it’s just great. But you have to have absolute confidence. Keep right on going, and nothing will happen.

One time I came home from college for a vacation, and my sister was sort of unhappy, almost crying: her Girl Scouts were having a father-daughter banquet, but our father was out on the road, selling uniforms. So I said I would take her, being the brother (I’m nine years older, so it wasn’t so crazy).

When we got there, I sat among the fathers for a while, but soon became sick of them. All these fathers bring their daughters to this nice little banquet, and all they talked about was the stock market–they don’t know how to talk to their own children, much less their children’s friends.

During the banquet the girls entertained us by doing little skits, reciting poetry, and so on. Then all of a sudden they bring out this funny-looking apronlike thing, with a hole at the top to put your head through. The girls announce that the fathers are now going to entertain _them_.

So each father has to get up and stick his head through and say something–one guy recites「Mary Had a Little Lamb」–and they don’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to do either, but by the time I got up there, I told them that I was going to recite a little poem, and I’m sorry that it’s not in English, but I’m sure they will appreciate it anyway:

A TUZZO LANTO

–Poici di Pare

TANto SAca TULna TI, na PUta TUchi PUti TI la.

RUNto CAta CHANto CHANta MANto CHI la TI da.

YALta CAra SULda MI la CHAta Picha Pino Tito

BRALda pe te CHIna nana CHUNda lala CHINda lala CHUNda!

RONto piti CA le, a TANto CHINto quinta LALda

ola TiNta dalla LALta, YENta PUcha lalla TALta!

I do this for three or four stanzas, going through all the emotions that I heard on Italian radio, and the kids are unraveled, rolling in the aisles, laughing with happiness.

After the banquet was over, the scoutmaster and a schoolteacher came over and told me they had been discussing my poem. One of them thought it was Italian, and the other thought it was Latin. The schoolteacher asks,「Which one of us is right?」

I said,「You’ll have to go ask the girls–they understood what language it was right away.」

———————– Always Trying to Escape ———————–

When I was a student at MIT I was interested only in science; I was no good at anything else. But at MIT there was a rule: You have to take some humanities courses to get more「culture.」Besides the English classes required were two electives, so I looked through the list, and right away I found astronomy–as a _humanities_ course! So that year I escaped with astronomy. Then next year I looked further down the list, past French literature and courses like that, and found philosophy. It was the closest thing to science I could find.

Before I tell you what happened in philosophy, let me tell you about the English class. We had to write a number of themes. For instance, Mill had written something on liberty, and we had to criticize it. But instead of addressing myself to _political_ liberty, as Mill did, I wrote about liberty in social occasions–the problem of having to fake and lie in order to be polite, and does this perpetual game of faking in social situations lead to the「destruction of the moral fiber of society.」An interesting question, but not the one we were supposed to discuss.

Another essay we had to criticize was by Huxley,「On a Piece of Chalk,」in which he describes how an ordinary piece of chalk he is holding is the remains from animal bones, and the forces inside the earth lifted it up so that it became part of the White Cliffs, and then it was quarried and is now used to conve ideas through writing on the l)lackboard.

But again, instead of criticizing the essay assigned to us, I wrote a parody called,「On a Piece of Dust,」about how dust makes the colors of the sunset and precipitates the rain, and so on. I was always a faker, always trying to escape.

But when we had to write a theme on Goethe’s _Faust_, it was hopeless! The work was too long to make a parody of it or to invent something else. I was storming back and forth in the fraternity saying,「I _can’t_ do it. I’m just _not_ gonna do it. I ain’t gonna do it!」

One of my fraternity brothers said,「OK, Feynman, you’re not gonna do it. But the professor will think you didn’t do it because you don’t want to do the work. You oughta write a theme on _something_–same number of words–and hand it in with a note saying that you just couldn’t understand the _Faust_, you haven’t got the heart for it, and that it’s impossible for you to write a theme on it.」

So I did that. I wrote a long theme,「On the Limitations of Reason.」I had thought about scientific techniques for solving problems, and how there are certain limitations: moral values cannot be decided by scientific methods, yak, yak, yak, and so on.

Then another fraternity brother offered some more advice.「Feynman,」he said,「it ain’t gonna work, handing in a theme that’s got nothing to do with _Faust_. What you oughta do is work that thing you wrote _into_ the _Faust_.」

「Ridiculous!」I said.

But the other fraternity guys think it’s a good idea.

「All right, all right!」I say, protesting.「I’ll try.」

So I added half a page to what 1 had already written, and said that Mephistopheles represents reason, and Faust represents the spirit, and Goethe is trying to show the limitations of reason. I stirred it up, cranked it all in, and handed in my theme.

The professor had us each come in individually to discuss our theme. I went in expecting the worst.

He said,「The introductory material is fine, but the _Faust_ material is a bit too brief. Otherwise, it’s very good– B + .」I escaped again!

Now to the philosophy class. The course was taught by an old bearded professor named Robinson, who always mumbled. I would go to the class, and he would mumble along, and I couldn’t understand a _thing_. The other people in the class seemed to understand him better, but they didn’t seem to pay any attention. I happened to have a small drill, about one-sixteenth-inch, and to pass the time in that class, I would twist it between my fingers and drill holes in the sole of my shoe, week after week.

Finally one day at the end of the class, Professor Robinson went「wugga mugga mugga wugga wugga . . . and everybody got excited! They were all talking to each other and discussing, so I figured he’d said something interesting, thank God! I wondered what it was?

I asked somebody, and they said,「We have to write a theme, and hand it in in four weeks.」

「A theme on what?」

「On what he’s been talking about all year.」

I was stuck. The only thing that I had heard during that entire term that I could remember was a moment when there came this upwelling,「muggawuggastreamofconsciousnessmugga wugga,」and _phoom!_–it sank back into chaos.

This「stream of consciousness」reminded me of a problem my father had given to me many years before. He said,「Suppose some Martians were to come down to earth, and Martians never slept, but instead were perpetually active. Suppose they didn’t have this crazy phenomenon that we have, called sleep. So they ask you the question: ‘How does it _feel_ to go to sleep? What _happens_ when you go to sleep? Do your thoughts suddenly stop, or do they move less aanndd lleeessss rraaaaapppppiidddddllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy yyy? How does the mind actually turn off?」

I got interested. Now I had to answer this question: How does the stream of consciousness _end_, when you go to sleep?

So every afternoon for the next four weeks I would work on my theme, I would pull down the shades in my room, turn off the lights, and go to sleep. And I’d watch what _happened_, when I went to sleep.

Then at night, I’d go to sleep again, so I had two times each day when I could make observations–it was very good!

At first I noticed a lot of subsidiary things that had little to do with falling asleep. I noticed, for instance, that I did a lot of thinking by speaking to myself internally. I could also imagine things visually.

Then, when I was getting tired, I noticed that I could think of two things at once. I discovered this when I was talking internally to myself about something, and _while_ I was doing this, I was idly imagining two ropes connected to the end of my bed, going through some pulleys, and winding around a turning cylinder, slowly lifting the bed. I wasn’t _aware_ that I was imagining these ropes until I began to worry that one rope would catch on the other rope, and they wouldn’t wind up smoothly. But I said, internally,「Oh, the tension will take care of that,」and this interrupted the first thought I was having, and made me aware that I was thinking of two things at once.

I also noticed that as you go to sleep the ideas continue, but they become less and less logically interconnected. You don’t _notice_ that they’re not logically connected until you ask yourself,「What made me think of that?」and you try to work your way back, and often you can’t remember what the hell _did_ make you think of that!

So you get every _illusion_ of logical connection, but the actual fact is that the thoughts become more and more cockeyed until they’re completely disjointed, and beyond that, you fall asleep.

After four weeks of sleeping all the time, I wrote my theme, and explained the observations I had made. At the end of the theme I pointed out that all of these observations were made while I was _watching_ myself fall asleep, and I don’t really know what it’s like to fall asleep when I’m not watching myself. I concluded the theme with a little verse I made up, which pointed out this problem of introspection:

_I wonder why. I wonder why._

_I wonder why I wonder._

_I wonder why I wonder why_

_I wonder why I wonder!_

We hand in our themes, and the next time our class meets, the professor reads one of them:「Mum bum wugga mum bum . . .」I can’t tell what the guy wrote.

He reads another theme:「Mugga wugga mum bum wugga wugga. . .」I don’t know what that guy wrote either, but at the end of it, he goes:

_Uh wugga wuh. Uh wugga wuh._

_Uh wugga wugga wugga._

_I wugga wuh uh wugga wuh_

_Uh wugga wugga wugga._

「Aha!」I say.「That’s _my_ theme!」I honestly didn’t recognize it until the end.

After I had written the theme I continued to be curious, and I kept practicing this watching myself as I went to sleep. One night, while I was having a dream, I realized I was observing myself _in_ the dream. I had gotten all the way down into the sleep itself!

In the first part of the dream I’m on top of a train and we’re approaching a tunnel. I get scared, pull myself down, and we go into the tunnel–whoosh! I say to myself,「So you can get the feeling of fear, and you can hear the sound change when you go into the tunnel.」

I also noticed that I could see colors. Some people had said that you dream in black and white, but no, I was dreaming in color.

By this time I was inside one of the train cars, and I can feel the train lurching about. I say to myself,「So you can get kinesthetic feelings in a dream.」I walk with some difficulty down to the end of the car, and I see a big window, like a store window. Behind it there are-not mannequins, but three live girls in bathing suits, and they look pretty good!

I continue walking into the next car, hanging onto the straps overhead as I go, when I say to myself,「Hey! It would be interesting to get excited–sexually–so I think I’ll go back into the other car.」I discovered that I could turn around, and walk back through the train–I could control the direction of my dream. I get back to the car with the special window, and I see three old guys playing violins–but they turned back into girls! So I could modify the direction of my dream, but not perfectly.

Well, I began to get excited, intellectually as well as sexually, saying things like,「Wow! It’s working!」and I woke up.

I made some other observations while dreaming. Apart from always asking myself,「Am I _really_ dreaming in color?」I wondered,「How accurately do you see something?」

The next time I had a dream, there was a girl lying in tall grass, and she had red hair. I tried to see if I could see _each_ hair. You know how there’s a little area of color just where the sun is reflecting–the diffraction effect, I could see _that_! I could see each hair as sharp as you want: perfect vision!

Another time I had a dream in which a thumbtack was stuck in a doorframe. I see the tack, run my fingers down the doorframe, and I feel the tack. So the「seeing department」and the「feeling department」of the brain seem to be connected. Then I say to myself, Could it be that they _don’t_ have to be connected? I look at the doorframe again, and there’s no thumbtack. I run my finger down the doorframe, and I _feel_ the tack!

Another time I’m dreaming and I hear「knock-knock; knock-knock.」Something was happening in the dream that made this knocking fit, but not perfectly–it seemed sort of foreign. I thought:「Absolutely guaranteed that this knocking is coming from _outside_ my dream, and I’ve invented this part of the dream to fit with it. I’ve _got_ to wake up and find out what the hell it is.」

The knocking is still going, I wake up, and . . . Dead silence. There was nothing. So it wasn’t connected to the outside.

Other people have told me that they have incorporated external noises into their dreams, but when I had this experience, carefully「watching from below,」and _sure_ the noise was coming from outside the dream, it wasn’t.

During the time of making observations in my dreams, the process of waking up was a rather fearful one. As you’re beginning to wake up there’s a moment when you feel rigid and tied down, or underneath many layers of cotton batting. It’s hard to explain, but there’s a moment when you get the feeling you can’t get out; you’re not sure you can wake up. So I would have to tell myself–after I was awake–that that’s ridiculous. There’s no disease I know of where a person falls asleep naturally and can’t wake up. You can _always_ wake up. And after talking to myself many times like that, I became less and less afraid, and in fact I found the process of waking up rather thrilling–something like a roller coaster: After a while you’re not so scared, and you begin to enjoy it a little bit.

You might like to know how this process of observing my dreams stopped (which it has for the most part; it’s happened just a few times since). I’m dreaming one night as usual, making observations, and I see on the wall in front of me a pennant. I answer for the twenty-fifth time,「Yes, I’m dreaming in color,」and then I realize that I’ve been sleeping with the back of my head against a brass rod. I put my hand behind my head and I feel that the back of my head is _soft_. I think,「Aha! _That’s_ why I’ve been able to make all these observations in my dreams: the brass rod has disturbed my visual cortex. All I have to do is sleep with a brass rod under my head, and I can make these observations any time I want. So I think I’ll stop making observations on this one, and go into deeper sleep.」

When I woke up later, there was no brass rod, nor was the back of my head soft. Somehow I had become tired of making these observations, and my brain had invented some false reasons as to why I shouldn’t do it any more.

As a result of these observations I began to get a little theory. One of the reasons that I liked to look at dreams was that I was curious as to how you can see an image, of a person, for example, when your eyes are closed, and nothing’s coming in. You say it might be random, irregular nerve discharges, but you can’t get the nerves to discharge in exactly the same delicate patterns when you are sleeping as when you are awake, looking at something. Well then, how could I「see」in color, and in better detail, when I was asleep?

I decided there must be an「interpretation department.」When you are actually looking at something–a man, a lamp, or a wall–you don’t just see blotches of color. Something tells you what it is; it has to be interpreted. When you’re dreaming, this interpretation department is still operating, but it’s all slopped up. It’s telling you that you’re seeing a human hair in the greatest detail, when it isn’t true. It’s interpreting the random junk entering the brain as a clear image.

One other thing about dreams. I had a friend named Deutsch, whose wife was from a family of psychoanalysts in Vienna. One evening, during a long discussion about dreams, he told me that dreams have significance: there are symbols in dreams that can be interpreted psychoanalytically. I didn’t believe most of this stuff, but that night I had an interesting dream: We’re playing a game on a billiard table with three balls–a white ball, a green ball, and a gray ball–and the name of the game is「titsies.」There was something about trying to get the balls into the pocket: the white ball and the green ball are easy to sink into the pocket, but the gray one, I can’t get to it.

I wake up, and the dream is very easy to interpret: the name of the game gives it away, of course-them’s girls! The white ball was easy to figure out, because I was going out, sneakily, with a married woman who worked at the time as a cashier in a cafeteria and wore a white uniform. The green one was also easy, because I had gone out about two nights before to a drive-in movie with a girl in a green dress. But the gray one-what the hell was the gray one? I knew it _had_ to be _somebody_; I _felt_ it. It’s like when you’re trying to remember a name, and it’s on the tip of your tongue, hut you can’t get it.

It took me half a day before I remembered that I had said goodbye to a girl I liked very much, who had gone to Italy about two or three months before. She was a very nice girl, and I had decided that when she came back I was going to see her again. I don’t know if she wore a gray suit, but it was perfectly clear, as soon as I thought of her, that she was the gray one.

I went back to my friend Deutsch, and I told him he must be right–there _is_ something to analyzing dreams. But when he heard about my interesting dream, he said,「No, that one was too perfect–too cut and dried. Usually you have to do a bit more analysis.」

————————– The Chief Research

Chemist of the

Metaplast Corporation ————————–

After I finished at MIT I wanted to get a summer job. I had applied two or three times to the Bell Labs, and had gone out a few times to visit. Bill Shockley, who knew me from the lab at MIT, would show me around each time, and I enjoyed those visits terrifically, but I never got a job there.

I had letters from some of my professors to two specific companies. One was to the Bausch and Lomb Company for tracing rays through lenses; the other was to Electrical Testing Labs in New York. At that time nobody knew what a physicist even was, and there weren’t any positions in industry for physicists. Engineers, OK; but physicists–nobody knew how to use them. It’s interesting that very soon, after the war, it was the exact opposite: people wanted physicists everywhere. So I wasn’t getting anywhere as a physicist looking for a job late in the Depression.

About that time I met an old friend of mine on the beach at our home town of Far Rockaway, where we grew up together. We had gone to school together when we were about eleven or twelve, and were very good friends. We were both scientifically minded. He had a「laboratory,」and I had a「laboratory.」We often played together, and discussed things together.

We used to put on magic shows–chemistry magic–for the kids on the block. My friend was a pretty good showman, and I kind of liked that too. We did our tricks on a little table, with Bunsen burners at each end going all the time. On the burners we had watch glass plates (flat glass discs) with iodine on them, which made a beautiful purple vapor that went up on each side of the table while the show went on. It was great! We did a lot of tricks, such as turning「wine」into water, and other chemical color changes. For our finale, we did a trick that used something which we had discovered. I would put my hands (secretly) first into a sink of water, and then into benzine. Then I would「accidentally」brush by one of the Bunsen burners, and one hand would light up. I’d clap my hands, and both hands would then be burning. (It doesn’t hurt because it burns fast and the water keeps it cool.) Then I’d wave my hands, running around yelling,「FIRE! FIRE!」and everybody would get all excited. They’d run out of the room, and that was the end of the show!

Later on I told this story at college to my fraternity brothers and they said,「Nonsense! You can’t _do_ that!」

(I often had this problem of demonstrating to these fellas something that they didn’t believe-like the time we got into an argument as to whether urine just ran out of you by gravity, and I had to demonstrate that that wasn’t the case by showing them that you can pee standing on your head. Or the time when somebody claimed that if you took aspirin and Coca-Cola you’d fall over in a dead faint directly. I told them I thought it was a lot of baloney, and offered to take aspirin and Coca-Cola together. Then they got into an argument whether you should have the aspirin before the Coke, just after the Coke, or mixed in the Coke. So I had six aspirin and three Cokes, one right after the other. First, I took aspirins and then a Coke, then we dissolved two aspirins in a Coke and I took that, and then I took a Coke and two aspirins. Each time the idiots who believed it were standing around me, waiting to catch me when I fainted. But nothing happened. I do remember that I didn’t sleep very well that night, so I got up and did a lot of figuring, and worked out some of the formulas for what is called the Riemann-Zeta function.)

「All right, guys,」I said.「Let’s go out and get some benzine.」

They got the henzine ready, I stuck my hand in the water in the sink and then into the benzine and lit it . . . and it hurt like hell! You see, in the meantime I had grown _hairs_ on the back of my hand, which acted like wicks and held the benzine in place while it burned, whereas when I had done it earlier I had no hairs on the back of my hand. After I _did_ the experiment for my fraternity brothers, I didn’t have any hairs on the back of my hands either.

Well, my pal and I met on the beach, and he told me that he had a process for metal-plating plastics. I said that was impossible, because there’s no conductivity; you can’t attach a wire. But he said he could metal-plate anything, and I still remember him picking up a peach pit that was in the sand, and saying he could metal-plate that–trying to impress me.

What was nice was that he offered me a job at his little company, which was on the top floor of a building in New York. There were only about four people in the company. His father was the one who was getting the money together and was, I think, the「president.」He was the「vice-president,」along with another fella who was a salesman. I was the「chief research chemist,」and my friend’s brother, who was not very clever, was the bottle-washer. We had six metal-plating baths.

They had this process for metal-plating plastics, and the scheme was: First, deposit silver on the object by precipitating silver from a silver nitrate bath with a reducing agent (like you make mirrors); then stick the object, with silver on it as a conductor, into an electroplating bath, and the silver gets plated.

The problem was, does the silver stick to the object?

It doesn’t. It peels off easily. So there was a step in between, to make the silver stick better to the object. It depended on the material. For things like Bakelite, which was an important plastic in those days, my friend had found that if he sandblasted it first, and then soaked it for many hours in stannous hydroxide, which got into the pores of the Bakelite, the silver would hold onto the surface very nicely.

But it worked only on a few plastics, and new kinds of plastics were coming out all the time, such as methyl methacrylate (which we call plexiglass, now), that we couldn’t plate directly, at first. And cellulose acetate, which was very cheap, was another one we couldn’t plate at first, though we finally discovered that putting it in sodium hydroxide for a little while before using the stannous chloride made it plate very well.

I was pretty successful as a「chemist」in the company. My advantage was that my pal had done no chemistry at all; he had done no experiments; he just knew how to do something once. I set to work putting lots of different knobs in bottles, and putting all kinds of chemicals in. By trying everything and keeping track of everything I found ways of plating a wider range of plastics than he had done before.

I was also able to simplify his process. From looking in books I changed the reducing agent from glucose to formaldehyde, and was able to recover 100 percent of the silver immediately, instead of having to recover the silver left in solution at a later time.

I also got the stannous hydroxide to dissolve in water by adding a little bit of hydrochloric acid–something I remembered from a college chemistry course–so a step that used to take _hours_ now took about five minutes.

My experiments were always being interrupted by the salesman, who would come back with some plastic from a prospective customer. I’d have all these bottles lined up, with everything marked, when all of a sudden,「You gotta stop the experiment to do a ’super job’ for the sales department!」So, a lot of experiments had to be started more than once.

One time we got into one hell of a lot of trouble. There was some artist who was trying to make a picture for the cover of a magazine about automobiles. He had very carefully built a wheel out of plastic, and somehow or other this salesman had told him we could plate anything, so the artist wanted us to metal-plate the hub, so it would be a shiny, silver hub. The wheel was made of a new plastic that we didn’t know very well how to plate–the fact is, the salesman never knew what we _could_ plate, so he was always promising things–and it didn’t work the first time. So, to fix it up we had to get the old silver off, and we couldn’t get it off easily. I decided to use concentrated nitric acid on it, which took the silver off all right, but also made pits and holes in the plastic. We were really in hot water _that_ time! In fact, we had lots of「hot water」experiments.

The other fellas in the company decided we should run advertisements in _Modern Plastics_ magazine. A few things we metal-plated were very pretty. They looked good in the advertisements. We also had a few things out in a showcase in front, for prospective customers to look at, but nobody could pick up the things in the advertisements or in the showcase to see how well the plating stayed on. Perhaps some of them were, in fact, pretty good jobs. But they were made specially; they were not regular products.

Right after I left the company at the end of the summer to go to Princeton, they got a good offer from somebody who wanted to metal-plate plastic pens. Now people could have silver pens that were light, and easy, and cheap. The pens immediately sold, all over, and it was rather exciting to see people walking around everywhere with these pens–and you knew where they came from.

But the company hadn’t had much experience with the material–or perhaps with the filler that was used in the plastic (most plastics aren’t pure; they have a「filler,」which in those days wasn’t very well controlled)–and the darn things would develop a blister. When you have something in your hand that has a little blister that starts to peel, you can’t help fiddling with it. So everybody was fiddling with all the peelings coming off the pens.

Now the company had this _emergency_ problem to fix the pens, and my pal decided he needed a big microscope, and so on. He didn’t know what he was going to look at, or why, and it cost his company a lot of money for this fake research. The result was, they had trouble: They never solved the problem, and the company failed, because their first big job was such a failure.

A few years later I was in Los Alamos, where there was a man named Frederic de Hoffman, who was a sort of scientist; but more, he was also very good at administrating. Not highly trained, he liked mathematics, and worked very hard; he compensated for his lack of training by hard work. Later he became the president or vice president of General Atomics and he was a big industrial character after that. But at the time he was just a very energetic, open-eyed, enthusiastic boy, helping along with the Project as best he could.

One day we were eating at the Fuller Lodge, and he told me he had been working in England before coming to Los Alamos.

「What kind of work were you doing there?」I asked.

「I was working on a process for metal-plating plastics. I was one of the guys in the laboratory.」

「How did it go?」

「It was going along pretty well, but we had our problems.」

「Oh?」

「Just as we were beginning to develop our process, there was a company in New York . . .」

「_What_ company in New York?」

「It was called the Metaplast Corporation. They were developing further than we were.」

「How could you tell?」

「They were advertising all the time in _Modern Plastics_ with full-page advertisements showing all the things they could plate, and we realized that they were further along than we were.」

「Did you have any stuff from them?」

「No, but you could tell from the advertisements that they were way ahead of what we could do. Our process was pretty good, but it was no use trying to compete with an American process like that.」

「How many chemists did you have working in the lab?」

「We had six chemists working.」

「How many chemists do you think the Metaplast Corporation had?」

「Oh! They must have had a _real_ chemistry department!」

「Would you describe for me what you think the chief research chemist at the Metaplast Corporation might look like, and how his laboratory might work?」

「I would guess they must have twenty-five or fifty chemists, and the chief research chemist has his own office–special, with glass. You know, like they have in the movies– guys coming in all the time with research projects that they’re doing, getting his advice, and rushing off to do more research, people coming in and out all the time. With twenty-five or fifty chemists, how the hell could we compete with them?」

「You’ll be interested and amused to know that you are now talking to the chief research chemist of the Metaplast Corporation, whose staff consisted of one bottle-washer!」

Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!

Part 2

The Princeton Years

————————————「Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!」————————————

When I was an undergraduate at MIT I loved it. I thought it was a great place, and I wanted to go to graduate school there too, of course. But when I went to Professor Slater and told him of my intentions, he said,「We won’t let you in here.」

I said,「What?」

Slater said,「Why do you think you should go to graduate school at MIT?」

「Because MIT is the best school for science in the country.」

「You _think_ that?」

「Yeah.」

「That’s why you should go to some other school. You should find out how the rest of the world is.」

So I decided to go to Princeton. Now Princeton had a certain aspect of elegance. It was an imitation of an English school, partly. So the guys in the fraternity, who knew my rather rough, informal manners, started making remarks like「Wait till they find out who they’ve got coming to Princeton! Wait till they see the mistake they made!」So I decided to try to be nice when I got to Princeton.

My father took me to Princeton in his car, and I got my room, and he left. I hadn’t been there an hour when I was met by a man:「I’m the Mahstah of Residences heah, and I should like to tell you that the Dean is having a Tea this aftanoon, and he should like to have all of you come. Perhaps you would be so kind as to inform your roommate, Mr. Serette.」

That was my introduction to the graduate「College」at Princeton, where all the students lived. It was like an imitation Oxford or Cambridge–complete with accents (the master of residences was a professor of「French littrachaw」). There was a porter downstairs, everybody had nice rooms, and we ate all our meals together, wearing academic gowns, in a great hall which had stained-glass windows.

So the very afternoon I arrived in Princeton I’m going to the dean’s tea, and I didn’t even know what a「tea」was, or why! I had no social abilities whatsoever; I had no experience with this sort of thing.

So I come up to the door, and there’s Dean Eisenhart, greeting the new students:「Oh, you’re Mr. Feynman,」he says.「We’re glad to have you.」So that helped a little, because he recognized me, somehow.

I go through the door, and there are some ladies, and some girls, too. It’s all very formal and I’m thinking about where to sit down and should I sit next to this girl, or not, and how should I behave, when I hear a voice behind me.

「Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?」It’s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea.

「I’ll have both, thank you,」I say, still looking for where I’m going to sit, when suddenly I hear「Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you’re _joking_, Mr. Feynman.」

Joking? Joking? What the hell did I just say? Then I realized what I had done. So that was my first experience with this tea business.

Later on, after I had been at Princeton longer, I got to understand this「Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.」In fact it was at that first tea, as I was leaving, that I realized it meant「You’re making a social error.」Because the _next_ time I heard this same cackle,「Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh,」from Mrs. Eisenhart, somebody was kissing her hand as he left.

Another time, perhaps a year later, at another tea, I was talking to Professor Wildt, an astronomer who had worked out some theory about the clouds on Venus. They were supposed to be formaldehyde (it’s wonderful to know what we once worried about) and he had it all figured out, how the formaldehyde was precipitating, and so on. It was extremely interesting. We were talking about all this stuff, when a little lady came up and said,「Mr. Feynman, Mrs. Eisenhart would like to see you.」

「OK, just a minute . . .」and I kept talking to Wildt.

The little lady came back again and said,「Mr. _Feynman_, Mrs. Eisenhart would like to see you.」

「OK, OK!」and I go over to Mrs. Eisenhart, who’s pouring tea.

「Would you like to have some coffee or tea, Mr. Feynman?」

「Mrs. So-and-so says you wanted to talk to me.」

「Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Would you like to have _coffee_, or _tea_, Mr. Feynman?」

「Tea,」I said,「thank you.」

A few moments later Mrs. Eisenhart’s daughter and a schoolmate came over, and we were introduced to each other. The whole idea of _this_「heh-heh-heh」was: Mrs. Eisenhart didn’t want to talk to me, she wanted me over there getting tea when her daughter and friend came over, so they would have someone to talk to. That’s the way it worked. By that time I knew what to do when I heard「Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.」I didn’t say,「What do you mean, ‘Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh’?」; I knew the「heh-heh-heh」meant「error,」and I’d better get it straightened out.

Every night we wore academic gowns to dinner. The first night it scared the life out of me, because I didn’t like formality. But I soon realized that the gowns were a great advantage. Guys who were out playing tennis could rush into their room, grab their academic gown, and put it on. They didn’t have to take time off to change their clothes or take a shower. So underneath the gowns there were bare arms, T-shirts, everything. Furthermore, there was a rule that you never cleaned the gown, so you could tell a first-year man from a second-year man, from a third-year man, from a pig! You never cleaned the gown and you never repaired it, so the first-year men had very nice, relatively clean gowns, but by the time you got to the third year or so, it was nothing but some kind of cardboard thing on your shoulders with tatters hanging down from it.

So when I got to Princeton, I went to that tea on Sunday afternoon and had dinner that evening in an academic gown at the「College.」But on Monday, the first thing I wanted to do was to see the cyclotron.

MIT had built a new cyclotron while I was a student there, and it was just _beautiful_! The cyclotron itself was in one room, with the controls in another room. It was beautifully engineered. The wires ran from the control room to the cyclotron underneath in conduits, and there was a whole console of buttons and meters. It was what I would call a gold-plated cyclotron.

Now I had read a lot of papers on cyclotron experiments, and there weren’t many from MIT. Maybe they were just starting. But there were lots of results from places like Cornell, and Berkeley, and above all, Princeton. Therefore what I really wanted to see, what I was looking forward to, was the PRINCETON CYCLOTRON. That must be _something!_

So first thing on Monday, I go into the physics building and ask,「Where is the cyclotron–which building?」

「It’s downstairs, in the basement–at the end of the hall.」

In the _basement_? It was an old building. There was no room in the basement for a cyclotron. I walked down to the end of the hall, went through the door, and in ten seconds I learned why Princeton was right for me–the best place for me to go to school. In this room there were wires strung _all over the place!_ Switches were hanging from the wires, cooling water was dripping from the valves, the room was _full_ of stuff, all out in the open. Tables piled with tools were everywhere; it was the most godawful mess you ever saw. The whole cyclotron was there in one room, and it was complete, absolute chaos!

It reminded me of my lab at home. Nothing at MIT had ever reminded me of my lab at home. I suddenly realized why Princeton was getting results. They were working with the instrument. They _built_ the instrument; they knew where everything was, they knew how everything worked, there was no engineer involved, except maybe he was working there too. It was much smaller than the cyclotron at MIT, and「gold-plated」?–it was the exact opposite. When they wanted to fix a vacuum, they’d drip glyptal on it, so there were drops of glyptal on the floor. It was wonderful! Because they _worked_ with it. They didn’t have to sit in another room and push buttons! (Incidentally, they had a fire in that room, because of all the chaotic mess that they had–too many wires–and it destroyed the cyclotron. But I’d better not tell about that!)

(When I got to Cornell I went to look at the cyclotron there. This cyclotron hardly required a room: It was about a yard across–the diameter of the whole thing. It was the world’s smallest cyclotron, hut they had got fantastic results. They had all kinds of special techniques and tricks. If they wanted to change something in the「D’s」–the D-shaped half circles that the particles go around–they’d take a screwdriver, and remove the D’s by hand, fix them, and put them back. At Princeton it was a lot harder, and at MIT you had to take a crane that came rolling across the ceiling, lower the hooks, and it was a _hellllll_ of a job.)

I learned a lot of different things from different schools. MIT is a _very_ good place; I’m not trying to put it down. I was just in love with it. It has developed for itself a spirit, so that every member of the whole place thinks that it’s the most wonderful place in the world–it’s the _center_, somehow, of scientific and technological development in the United States, if not the world. It’s like a New Yorker’s view of New York: they forget the rest of the country. And while you don’t get a good sense of proportion there, you do get an excellent sense of being _with_ it and _in_ it, and having motivation and desire to keep on–that you’re specially chosen, and lucky to be there.

So MIT was good, hut Slater was right to warn me to go to another school for my graduate work. And I often advise my students the same way. Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile.

I once did an experiment in the cyclotron laboratory at Princeton that had some startling results. There was a problem in a hydrodynamics book that was being discussed by all the physics students. The problem is this: You have an S-shaped lawn sprinkler–an S-shaped pipe on a pivot–and the water squirts out at right angles to the axis and makes it spin in a certain direction. Everybody knows which way it goes around; it backs away from the outgoing water. Now the question is this: If you had a lake, or swimming pool–a big supply of water–and you put the sprinkler completely under water, and sucked the water in, instead of squirting it out, which way would it turn? Would it turn the same way as it does when you squirt water out into the air, or would it turn the other way?

The answer is perfectly clear at first sight. The trouble was, some guy would think it was perfectly clear one way, and another guy would think it was perfectly clear the other way. So everybody was discussing it. I remember at one particular seminar, or tea, somebody went nip to Prof John Wheeler and said,「Which way do _you_ think it goes around?」

Wheeler said,「Yesterday, Feynman convinced me that it went backwards. Today, he’s convinced me equally well that it goes around the other way. I don’t know _what_ he’ll convince me of tomorrow!」

I’ll tell you an argument that will make you think it’s one way, and another argument that will make you think it’s the other way, OK?

One argument is that when you’re sucking water in, you’re sort of pulling the water with the nozzle, so it will go forward, towards the incoming water.

But then another guy comes along and says,「Suppose we hold it still and ask what kind of a torque we need to hold it still. In the case of the water going out, we all know you have to hold it on the outside of the curve, because of the centrifugal force of the water going around the curve, Now, when the water goes around the same curve the _other_ way, it still makes the same centrifugal force toward the outside of the curve. Therefore the two cases are the same, and the sprinkler will go around the same way, whether you’re squirting water out or sucking it in.」

After some thought, I finally made up my mind what the answer was, and in order to demonstrate it, I wanted to do an experiment.

In the Princeton cyclotron lab they had a big carboy–a monster bottle of water. I thought this was just great for the experiment. I got a piece of copper tubing and bent it into an S-shape. Then in the middle I drilled a hole, stuck in a piece of rubber hose, and led it up through a hole in a cork I had put in the top of the bottle. The cork had another hole, into which I put another piece of rubber hose, and connected it to the air pressure supply of the lab. By blowing air into the bottle, I could force water into the copper tubing exactly as if I were sucking it in. Now, the S-shaped tubing wouldn’t turn around, but it would twist (because of the flexible rubber hose), and I was going to measure the speed of the water flow by measuring how far it squirted out of the top of the bottle.

I got it all set up, turned on the air supply, and it went「_Puup!_」The air pressure blew the cork out of the bottle. I wired it in very well, so it wouldn’t jump out. Now the experiment was going pretty good. The water was coming out, and the hose was twisting, so I put a little more pressure on it, because with a higher speed, the measurements would be more accurate. I measured the angle very carefully, and measured the distance, and increased the pressure again, and suddenly the whole thing just blew glass and water in all directions throughout the laboratory. A guy who had come to watch got all wet and had to go home and change his clothes (it’s a miracle he didn’t get cut by the glass), and lots of cloud chamber pictures that had been taken patiently using the cyclotron were all wet, but for some reason I was far enough away, or in some such position that I didn’t get very wet. But I’ll always remember how the great Professor Del Sasso, who was in charge of the cyclotron, came over to me and said sternly,「The freshman experiments should be done in the freshman laboratory!」

————- Meeeeeeeeeee! ————-

On Wednesdays at the Princeton Graduate College, various people would come in to give talks. The speakers were often interesting, and in the discussions after the talks we used to have a lot of fun. For instance, one guy in our school was very strongly anti-Catholic, so he passed out questions in advance for people to ask a religious speaker, and we gave the speaker a hard time.

Another time somebody gave a talk about poetry. He talked about the structure of the poem and the emotions that come with it; he divided everything up into certain kinds of classes. In the discussion that came afterwards, he said,「Isn’t that the same as in mathematics, Dr. Eisenhart?」

Dr. Eisenhart was the dean of the graduate school and a great professor of mathematics. He was also very clever. He said,「I’d like to know what Dick Feynman thinks about it in reference to theoretical physics.」He was always putting me on in this kind of situation.

I got up and said,「Yes, it’s very closely related. In theoretical physics, the analog of the word is the mathematical formula, the analog of the structure of the poem is the interrelationship of the theoretical bling-bling with the so-andso」–and I went through the whole thing, making a perfect analogy. The speaker’s eyes were _beaming_ with happiness.

Then I said,「It seems to me that no matter _what_ you say about poetry, I could find a way of making up an analog with _any_ subject, just as I did for theoretical physics. I don’t consider such analogs meaningful.」

In the great big dining hall with stained-glass windows, where we always ate, in our steadily deteriorating academic gowns, Dean Eisenhart would begin each dinner by saying grace in Latin. After dinner he would often get up and make some announcements. One night Dr. Eisenhart got up and said,「Two weeks from now, a professor of psychology is coming to give a talk about hypnosis. Now, this professor thought it would be much better if we had a real demonstration of hypnosis instead of just talking about it. Therefore he would like some people to volunteer to be hypnotized.

I get all excited: There’s no question but that I’ve got to find out about hypnosis. This is going to he terrific!

Dean Eisenhart went on to say that it would be good if three or four people would volunteer so that the hypnotist could try them out first to see which ones would be able to be hypnotized, so he’d like to urge very much that we apply for this. (_He’s wasting all this time_, for God’s sake!)

Eisenhart was down at one end of the hall, and I was way down at the other end, in the back. There were hundreds of guys there. I knew that everybody was going to want to do this, and I was terrified that he wouldn’t see me because I was so far back. I just had to get in on this demonstration!

Finally Eisenhart said,「And so I would like to ask if there are going to be any volunteers . . .」

I raised my hand and shot out of my seat, screaming as loud as I could, to make sure that he would hear me:「MEEEEEEEEEEE!」

He heard me all right, because there wasn’t another soul. My voice reverberated throughout the hall–it was very embarrassing. Eisenhart’s immediate reaction was,「Yes, of course, I knew _you_ would volunteer, Mr. Feynman, but I was wondering if there would be anybody _else_.」

Finally a few other guys volunteered, and a week before the demonstration the man came to practice on us, to see if any of us would be good for hypnosis. I knew about the phenomenon, but I didn’t know what it was like to be hypnotized.

He started to work on me and soon I got into a position where he said,「You can’t open your eyes.」

I said to myself,「I bet I _could_ open my eyes, but I don’t want to disturb the situation: Let’s see how much further it goes.」It was an interesting situation: You’re only slightly fogged out, and although you’ve lost a little bit, you’re pretty sure you could open your eyes. But of course, you’re not opening your eyes, so in a sense you can’t do it.

He went through a lot of stuff and decided that I was pretty good.

When the real demonstration came he had us walk on stage, and he hypnotized us in front of the whole Princeton Graduate College. This time the effect was stronger; I guess I had learned how to become hypnotized. The hypnotist made various demonstrations, having me do things that I couldn’t normally do, and at the end he said that after I came out of hypnosis, instead of returning to my seat directly, which was the natural way to go, I would walk all the way around the room and go to my seat from the back.

All through the demonstration I was vaguely aware of what was going on, and cooperating with the things the hypnotist said, but this time I decided,「Damn it, enough is enough! I’m gonna go straight to my seat.」

When it was time to get up and go off the stage, I started to walk straight to my seat. But then an annoying feeling came over me: I felt so uncomfortable that I couldn’t continue. I walked all the way around the hall.

I was hypnotized in another situation some time later by a woman. While I was hypnotized she said,「I’m going to light a match, blow it out, and immediately touch the back of your hand with it. You will feel no pain.」

I thought,「Baloney!」She took a match, lit it, blew it out, and touched it to the back of my hand. It felt slightly warm. My eyes were closed throughout all of this, but I was thinking,「That’s easy. She lit one match, but touched a different match to my hand. There’s nothin’ to _that_; it’s a fake!」

When I came out of the hypnosis and looked at the back of my hand, I got the biggest surprise: There was a burn on the back of my hand. Soon a blister grew, and it never hurt at all, even when it broke.

So I found hypnosis to be a very interesting experience. All the time you’re saying to yourself,「I could do that, but I won’t」–which is just another way of saying that you can’t.

—————– A Map of the Cat? —————–

In the Graduate College dining room at Princeton everybody used to sit with his own group. I sat with the physicists, but after a bit I thought: It would be nice to see what the rest of the world is doing, so I’ll sit for a week or two in each of the other groups.

When I sat with the philosophers I listened to them discuss very seriously a book called _Process and Reality_ by Whitehead. They were using words in a funny way, and I couldn’t quite understand what they were saying. Now I didn’t want to interrupt them in their own conversation and keep asking them to explain something, and on the few occasions that I did, they’d try to explain it to me, but I still didn’t get it. Finally they invited me to come to their seminar.

They had a seminar that was like, a class. It had been meeting once a week to discuss a new chapter out of _Process and Reality_–some guy would give a report on it and then there would be a discussion. I went to this seminar promising myself to keep my mouth shut, reminding myself that I didn’t know anything about the subject, and I was going there just to watch.

What happened there was typical–so typical that it was unbelievable, but true. First of all, I sat there without saying anything, which is almost unbelievable, but also true. A student gave a report on the chapter to be studied that week. In it Whitehead kept using the words「essential object」in a particular technical way that presumably he had defined, but that I didn’t understand.

After some discussion as to what「essential object」meant, the professor leading the seminar said something meant to clarify things and drew something that looked like lightning bolts on the blackboard.「Mr. Feynman,」he said,「would you say an electron is an ‘essential object’?」

Well, now I was in trouble. I admitted that I hadn’t read the book, so I had no idea of what Whitehead meant by the phrase; I had only come to watch.「But,」I said,「I’ll try to answer the professor’s question if you will first answer a question from me, so I can have a better idea of what ‘essential object’ means. Is a _brick_ an essential object?」

What I had intended to do was to find out whether they thought theoretical constructs were essential objects. The electron is a _theory_ that we use; it is so useful in understanding the way nature works that we can almost call it real. I wanted to make the idea of a theory clear by analogy. In the case of the brick, my next question was going to be,「What about the _inside_ of the brick?」–and I would then point out that no one has ever seen the inside of a brick. Every time you break the brick, you only see the surface. That the brick has an inside is a simple theory which helps us understand things better. The theory of electrons is analogous. So I began by asking,「Is a brick an essential object?」

Then the answers came out. One man stood up and said,「A brick as an individual, specific brick. _That_ is what Whitehead means by an essential object.」

Another man said,「No, it isn’t the individual brick that is an essential object; it’s the general character that all bricks have in common–their ‘brickiness’–that is the essential object.」

Another guy got up and said,「No, it’s not in the bricks themselves. ‘Essential object’ means the idea in the mind that you get when you think of bricks.」

Another guy got up, and another, and I tell you I have never heard such ingenious different ways of looking at a brick before. And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos. In all their previous discussions they hadn’t even asked themselves whether such a simple object as a brick, much less an electron, is an「essential object.」

After that I went around to the biology table at dinner time. I had always had some interest in biology, and the guys talked about very interesting things. Some of them invited me to come to a course they were going to have in cell physiology. I knew something about biology, but this was a graduate course.「Do you think I can handle it? Will the professor let me in?」I asked.

They asked the instructor, E. Newton Harvey, who had done a lot of research on light-producing bacteria. Harvey said I could join this special, advanced course provided one thing–that I would do all the work, and report on papers just like everybody else.

Before the first class meeting, the guys who had invited me to take the course wanted to show me some things under the microscope. They had some plant cells in there, and you could see some little green spots called chloroplasts (they make sugar when light shines on them) circulating around. I looked at them and then looked up:「How do they circulate? What pushes them around?」I asked.

Nobody knew. It turned out that it was not understood at that time. So right away I found out something about biology: it was very easy to find a question that was very interesting, and that nobody knew the answer to. In physics you had to go a little deeper before you could find an interesting question that people didn’t know.

When the course began, Harvey started out by drawing a great, big picture of a cell on the blackboard and labeling all the things that are in a cell. He then talked about them, and I understood most of what he said.

After the lecture, the guy who had invited me said,「Well, how did you like it?」

「Just fine,」I said.「The only part I didn’t understand was the part about lecithin. What is lecithin?」

The guy begins to explain in a monotonous voice:「All living creatures, both plant and animal, are made of little bricklike objects called ‘cells’.

「Listen,」I said, impatiently,「I _know_ all that; otherwise I wouldn’t be in the course. What is _lecithin_?」

「I don’t know.」

I had to report on papers along with everyone else, and the first one I was assigned was on the effect of pressure on cells–Harvey chose that topic for me because it had something that had to do with physics. Although I understood what I was doing, I mispronounced everything when I read my paper, and the class was always laughing hysterically when I’d talk about「blastospheres」instead of「blastomeres,」or some other such thing.

The next paper selected for me was by Adrian and Bronk. They demonstrated that nerve impulses were sharp, single-pulse phenomena. They had done experiments with cats in which they had measured voltages on nerves.

I began to read the paper. It kept talking about extensors and flexors, the gastrocnemius muscle, and so on. This and that muscle were named, but I hadn’t the foggiest idea of where they were located in relation to the nerves or to the cat. So I went to the librarian in the biology section and asked her if she could find me a map of the cat.

「_A map of the cat_, sir?」she asked, horrified.「You mean a _zoological chart_!」From then on there were rumors about some dumb biology graduate student who was looking for a「map of the cat.」

When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles.

The other students in the class interrupt me:「We _know_ all that!」

「Oh,」I say,「you _do?_ Then no _wonder_ I can catch up with you so fast after you’ve had four years of biology.」They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.

After the war, every summer I would go traveling by car somewhere in the United States. One year, after I was at Caltech, I thought,「This summer, instead of going to a different place, I’ll go to a different _field_.」

It was right after Watson and Crick’s discovery of the DNA spiral. There were some very good biologists at Caltech because Delbrück had his lab there, and Watson came to Caltech to give some lectures on the coding systems of DNA. I went to his lectures and to seminars in the biology department and got full of enthusiasm. It was a very exciting time in biology, and Caltech was a wonderful place to be.

I didn’t think I was up to doing actual research in biology, so for my summer visit to the field of biology I thought I would just hang around the biology lab and「wash dishes,」while I watched what they were doing. I went over to the biology lab to tell them my desire, and Bob Edgar, a young post-doc who was sort of in charge there, said he wouldn’t let me do that. He said,「You’ll have to really do some research, just like a graduate student, and we’ll give you a problem to work on.」That suited me fine.

I took a phage course, which told us how to do research with bacteriophages (a phage is a virus that contains DNA and attacks bacteria). Right away I found that I was saved a lot of trouble because I knew some physics and mathematics. I knew how atoms worked in liquids, so there was nothing mysterious about how the centrifuge worked. I knew enough statistics to understand the statistical errors in counting little spots in a dish. So while all the l)iology guys were trying to understand these「new」things, I could spend my time learning the biology part.

There was one useful lab technique I learned in that course which I still use today. They taught us how to hold a test tube and take its cap off with one hand (you use your middle and index fingers), while leaving the other hand free to do something else (like hold a pipette that you’re sucking cyanide up into). Now, I can hold my toothbrush in one hand, and with the other hand, hold the tube of toothpaste, twist the cap off, and put it back on.

It had been discovered that phages could have mutations which would affect their ability to attack bacteria, and we were supposed to study those mutations. There were also some phages that would have a second mutation which would reconstitute their ability to attack bacteria. Some phages which mutated back were exactly the same as they were before. Others were not: There was a slight difference in their effect on bacteria–they would act faster or slower than normal, and the bacteria would grow slower or faster than normal. In other words, there were「back mutations, but they weren’t always perfect; sometimes the phage would recover only part of the ability it had lost.

Bob Edgar suggested that I do an experiment which would try to find out if the back mutations occurred in the same place on the DNA spiral. With great care and a lot of tedious work I was able to find three examples of back mutations which had occurred very close together–closer than anything they had ever seen so far–and which partially restored the phage’s ability to function. It was a slow job. It was sort of accidental: You had to wait around until von got a double mutation, which was very rare.

I kept trying to think of ways to make a phage mutate more often and how to detect mutations more quickly, but before I could come up with a good technique the summer was over, and I didn’t feel like continuing on that problem.

However, my sabbatical year was coming up, so I decided to work in the same biology lab but on a different subject. I worked with Matt Meselson to some extent, and then with a nice fella from England named J. D. Smith. The problem had to do with ribosomes, the「machinery」in the cell that makes protein from what we now call messenger RNA. Using radioactive substances, we demonstrated that the RNA could come out of ribosomes and could be put back in.

I did a very careful job in measuring and trying to control everything, but it took me eight months to realize that there was one step that was sloppy. In preparing the bacteria, to get the ribosomes out, in those days you ground it up with alumina in a mortar. Everything else was chemical and all under control, but you could never repeat the way you pushed the pestle around when you were grinding the bacteria. So nothing ever came of the experiment.

Then I guess I have to tell about the time I tried with Hildegarde Lamfrom to discover whether peas could use the same ribosomes as bacteria. The question was whether the ribosomes of bacteria can manufacture the proteins of humans or other organisms, She had just developed a scheme for getting the ribosomes out of peas and giving them messenger RNA so that they would make pea proteins. We realized that a very dramatic and important question was whether ribosomes from bacteria, when given the peas’ messenger RNA, would make pea protein or bacteria protein. It was to be a very dramatic and fundamental experiment.

Hildegarde said,「I’ll need a lot of ribosomes from bacteria.」

Meselson and I had extracted enormous quantities of ribosomes from _E. coli_ for some other experiment. I said,「Hell, I’ll just give you the ribosomes we’ve got. We have plenty of them in my refrigerator at the lab.」

It would have been a fantastic and vital discovery if I had been a good biologist. But I wasn’t a good biologist. We had a good idea, a good experiment, the right equipment, but I screwed it up: I gave her infected ribosomes–the grossest possible error that you could make in an experiment like that. My ribosomes had been in the refrigerator for almost a month, and had become contaminated with some other living things. Had I prepared those ribosomes promptly over again and given them to her in a serious and careful way, with everything under control, that experiment would have worked,. and we would have been the first to demonstrate the uniformity of life: the machinery of making proteins, the rihosomes, is the same in every creature. We were there at the right place, we were doing the right things, but I was doing things as an amateur–stupid and sloppy.

You know what it reminds me of? The husband of Madame Bovary in Flaubert’s book, a dull country doctor who had some idea of how to fix club feet, and all he did was screw people up. I was similar to that unpracticed surgeon.

The other work on the phage I never wrote up–Edgar kept asking me to write it up, hut I never got around to it. That’s the trouble with not being in your own field: You don’t take it seriously.

I did write something informally on it. I sent it to Edgar, who laughed when he read it. It wasn’t in the standard form that biologists use–first, procedures, and so forth. I spent a lot of time explaining things that all the biologists knew. Edgar made a shortened version, hut I couldn’t understand it. I don’t think they ever published it. I never published it directly.

Watson thought the stuff I had done with phages was of some interest, so he invited me to go to Harvard. I gave a talk to the biology department about the double mutations which occurred so close together. I told them my guess was that one mutation made a change in the protein, such as changing the pH of an amino acid, while the other mutation made the opposite change on a different amino acid in the same protein, so that it partially balanced the first imitation– not perfectly, but enough to let the phage operate again. I thought they were two changes in the same protein, which chemically compensated each other.

That turned out not to be the case. It was found out a few years later by people who undoubtedly developed a technique for producing and detecting the mutations faster, that what happened was, the first mutation was a mutation in which an entire DNA base was missing. Now the「code」was shifted and could not be read any more. The second mutation was either one in which an extra base was put back in, or two more were taken out. Now the code could be read again. The closer the second mutation occurred to the first, the less message would he altered by the double mutation, and the more completely the phage would recover its lost abilities. The fact that there are three「letters」to code each amino acid was thus demonstrated.

While I was at Harvard that week, Watson suggested something and we did an experiment together for a few days. It was an incomplete experiment, but I learned some new lab techniques from one of the best men in the field.

But that was my big moment: I gave a seminar in the biology department of Harvard! I always do that, get into something and see how far I can go.

I learned a lot of things in biology, and I gained a lot of experience. I got better at pronouncing the words, knowing what not to include in a paper or a seminar, and detecting a weak technique in an experiment. But I love physics, and I love to go back to it.

————- Monster Minds ————-

While I was still a graduate student at Princeton, I worked as a research assistant under John Wheeler. He gave me a problem to work on, and it got hard, and I wasn’t getting anywhere. So I went back to an idea that I had had earlier, at MIT. The idea was that electrons don’t act on themselves, they only act on other electrons.

There was this problem: When you shake an electron, it radiates energy and so there’s a loss. That means there must he a force on it. And there must he a different force when it’s charged than when it’s not charged. (If the force were exactly the same when it was charged and not charged, in one case it would lose energy, and in the other it wouldn’t. You can’t have two different answers to the same problem.)

The standard theory was that it was the electron acting on itself that made that force (called the force of radiation reaction), and I had only electrons acting on other electrons. So I was in some difficulty, I realized, by that time. (When I was at MIT, I got the idea without noticing the problem, but by the time I got to Princeton, I knew that problem.)

What I thought was: I’ll shake this electron. It will make some nearby electron shake, and the effect back from the neari)y electron would be the origin of the force of radiation reaction. So I did some calculations and took them to Wheeler.

Wheeler, right away said,「Well, that isn’t right because it varies inversely as the square of the distance of the other electrons, whereas it should not depend on any of these variables at all. It’ll also depend inversely upon the mass of the other electron; it’ll be proportional to the charge on the other electron.」

What bothered me was, I thought he must have _done_ the calculation. I only realized later that a man like Wheeler could immediately _see_ all that stuff when you give him the problem. I had to calculate, but he could see.

Then he said,「And it’ll he delayed–the wave returns late–so all you’ve described is reflected light.」

「Oh! Of course,」I said.

「But wait,」he said.「Let’s suppose it returns by advanced waves–reactions backward in time–so it comes back at the right time. We saw the effect varied inversely as the square of the distance, but suppose there are a lot of electrons, all over space: the number is proportional to the square of the distance. So maybe we can make it all compensate.」

We found out we could do that. It came out very nicely, and fit very well. It was a classical theory that could be right, even though it differed from Maxwell’s standard, or Lorentz’s standard theory. It didn’t have any trouble with the infinity of self-action, and it was ingenious. It had actions and delays, forwards and backwards in time–we called it「half-advanced and half-retarded potentials.」

Wheeler and I thought the next problem was to turn to the quantum theory of electrodynamics, which had difficulties (I thought) with the self-action of the electron. We figured if we could get rid of the difficulty first in classical physics, and then make a quantum theory out of that, we could straighten out the quantum theory as well.

Now that we had got the classical theory right, Wheeler said,「Feynman, you’re a young fella–you should give a seminar on this. You need experience in giving talks. Meanwhile, I’ll work out the quantum theory part and give a seminar on that later.」

So it was to be my first technical talk, and Wheeler made arrangements with Eugene Wigner to put it on the regular seminar schedule.

A day or two before the talk I saw Wigner in the hail.「Feynman,」he said,「I think that work you’re doing with Wheeler is very interesting, so I’ve invited Russell to the seminar.」Henry Norris Russell, the famous, great astronomer of the day, was coming to the lecture!

Wigner went on.「I think Professor von Neumann would also he interested.」Johnny von Neumann was the greatest mathematician around.「And Professor Pauli is visiting from Switzerland, it so happens, so I’ve invited Professor Pauli to come」–Pauli was a very famous physicist–and by this time, I’m turning yellow. Finally, Wigner said,「Professor Einstein only rarely comes to our weekly seminars, but your work is so interesting that I’ve invited him specially, so he’s coming, too.」

By this time I must have turned green, because Wigner said,「No, no! Don’t worry! I’ll just warn you, though: If Professor Russell falls asleep–and he will undoubtedly fall asleep–it doesn’t mean that the seminar is bad; he falls asleep in all the seminars. On the other hand, if Professor Pauli is nodding all the time, and seems to be in agreement as the seminar goes along, pay no attention. Professor Pauli has palsy.」

I went back to Wheeler and named all the big, famous people who were coming to the talk he got me to give, and told him I was uneasy about it.

「It’s all right,」he said.「Don’t worry. I’ll answer all the questions.」

So I prepared the talk, and when the day came, I went in and did something that young men who have had no experience in giving talks often do–I put too many equations up on the blackboard. You see, a young fella doesn’t know how to say,「Of course, that varies inversely, and this goes this way . . . because everybody listening already knows; they can see it. But _he_ doesn’t know. He can only make it come out by actually doing the algebra–and therefore the reams of equations.

As I was writing these equations all over the blackboard ahead of time, Einstein came in and said pleasantly,「Hello, I’m coming to your seminar. But first, where is the tea?」

I told him, and continued writing the equations.

Then the time came to give the talk, and here are these _monster minds_ in front of me, waiting! My first technical talk–and I have this audience! I mean they would put me through the wringer! I remember very clearly seeing my hands shaking as they were pulling out my notes from a brown envelope.

But then a miracle occurred, as it has occurred again and again in my life, and it’s very lucky for me: the moment I start to think about the physics, and have to concentrate on what I’m explaining, nothing else occupies my mind–I’m completely immune to being nervous. So after I started to go, I just didn’t know who was in the room. I was only explaining this idea, that’s all.

But then the end of the seminar came, and it was time for questions. First off, Pauli, who was sitting next to Einstein, gets up and says,「I do not sink dis teory can be right, because of dis, and dis, and dis,」and he turns to Einstein and says,「Don’t you agree, Professor Einstein?」

Einstein says,「Nooooooooooooo,」a nice, Germansounding「No,「–very polite.「I find only that it would be very difficult to make a corresponding theory for gravitational interaction.」He meant for the general theory of relativity, which was his baby. He continued:「Since we have at this time not a great deal of experimental evidence, I am not absolutely sure of the correct gravitational theory.」Einstein appreciated that things might he different from what his theory stated; he was very tolerant of other ideas.

I wish I had remembered what Pauli said, because I discovered years later that the theory was not satisfactory when it came to making the quantum theory. It’s possible that that great man noticed the difficulty immediately and explained it to me in the question, hut I was so relieved at not having to answer the questions that I didn’t really listen to them carefully. I do remember walking up the steps of Palmer Library with Pauli, who said to me,「What is Wheeler going to say about the quantum theory when he gives his talk?」

I said,「I don’t know. He hasn’t told me. He’s working it out himself.」

「Oh?」he said.「The man works and doesn’t tell his assistant what he’s doing ‘on the quantum theory?」He came closer to me and said in a low, secretive voice,「Wheeler will never give that seminar.」

And it’s true. Wheeler didn’t give the seminar. He thought it would he easy to work out the quantum part; he thought he had it, almost. But he didn’t. And by the time the seminar came around, he realized he didn’t know how to do it, and therefore didn’t have anything to say.

I never solved it, either–a quantum theory of halfadvanced, half-retarded potentials–and I worked on it for years.

————- Mixing Paints ————-

The reason why I say I’m「uncultured」or「anti-intellectual」probably goes all the way back to the time when I was in high school. I was always worried about being a sissy; I didn’t want to he too delicate. To me, no _real_ man ever paid any attention to poetry and such things. How poetry ever got _written_–that never struck me! So I developed a negative attitude toward the guy who studies French literature, or studies too much music or poetry–all those「fancy」things. I admired better the steel-worker, the welder, or the machine shop man. I always thought the guy who worked in the machine shop and could make things, now _he_ was a _real guy_! That was my attitude. To be a practical man was, to me, always somehow a positive virtue, and to be「cultured」or「intellectual」was not. The first was right, of course, hut the second was crazy.

I still had this feeling when I was doing my graduate study at Princeton, as you’ll see. I used to eat often in a nice little restaurant called Papa’s Place. One day while I was eating there, a painter in his painting clothes came down from an upstairs room he’d been painting, and sat near me. Somehow we struck up a conversation and he started talking about how you’ve got to learn a lot to be in the painting business.「For example,」he said,「in this restaurant, what colors would you use to paint the walls, if _you_ had the job to do?」

I said I didn’t know, and he said,「You have a dark band up to such-and-such a height, because, you see, people who sit at the tables rub their elbows against the walls, so you don’t want a nice, white wall there. It gets dirty too easily. But above that, you _do_ want it white to give a feeling of cleanliness to the restaurant.」

The guy seemed to know what he was doing, and I was sitting there, hanging on his words, when he said,「And you also have to know about colors–how to get different colors when you mix the paint. For example, what colors would _you_ mix to get yellow?」

I didn’t know how to get yellow by mixing paints. If it’s _light_, you mix green and red, but I knew he was talking _paints_. So I said,「I don’t know how you get yellow without using yellow.」

「Well,」he said,「if you mix red and white, you’ll get yellow.」

「Are you sure you don’t mean _pink_?」

「No,」he said,「you’ll get yellow」–and I believed that he got yellow, because he was a professional painter, and I always admired guys like that. But I still wondered how he did it.

I got an idea.「It must be some kind of _chemical_ change. Were you using some special kind of pigments that make a chemical change?」

「No,」he said,「any old pigments will work. You go down to the five-and-ten and get some paint–just a regular can of red paint and a regular can of white paint–and I’ll mix ‘em, and I’ll show how you get yellow.」

At this juncture I was thinking,「Something is crazy. I know enough about paints to know you won’t get yellow, but _he_ must know that you _do_ get yellow, and therefore something interesting happens. I’ve got to see what it is!」

So I said,「OK, I’ll get the paints.」

The painter went back upstairs to finish his painting job, and the restaurant owner came over and said to me,「What’s the idea of arguing with that man? The man is a painter; he’s been a painter all his life, and _he_ says he gets yellow. So why argue with him?」

I felt embarrassed. I didn’t know what to say. Finally I said,「All my life, I’ve been studying light. And I think that with red and white you _can’t_ get yellow–you can only get pink.」

So I went to the five-and-ten and got the paint, and brought it back to the restaurant. The painter came down from upstairs, and the restaurant owner was there too. I put the cans of paint on an old chair, and the painter began to mix the paint. He put a little more red, he put a little more white–it still looked pink to me–and he mixed some more. Then he mumbled something like,「I used to have a little tube of yellow here to sharpen it up a bit–then this’ll be yellow.」

「Oh!」I said.「Of course! You add yellow, and you can get yellow, but you couldn’t do it without the yellow.」

The painter went back upstairs to paint.

The restaurant owner said,「That guy has his nerve, arguing with a guy who’s studied light all his life!」

But that shows you how much I trusted these「real guys.」The painter had told me so much stuff that was reasonable that I was ready to give a certain chance that there was an odd phenomenon I didn’t know. I was expecting pink, but my set of thoughts were,「The only way to get yellow will be something new and interesting, and I’ve got to see this.」

I’ve very often made mistakes in my physics by thinking the theory isn’t as good as it really is, thinking that there are lots of complications that are going to spoil it–an attitude that anything can happen, in spite of what you’re pretty sure should happen.

———————— A Different Box of Tools ————————

At the Princeton graduate school, the physics department and the math department shared a common lounge, and every day at four o’clock we would have tea. It was a way of relaxing in the afternoon, in addition to imitating an English college. People would sit around playing Go, or discussing theorems. In those days topology was the big thing.

I still remember a guy sitting on the couch, thinking very hard, and another guy standing in front of him, saying,「And therefore such-and-such is true.」

「Why is that?」the guy on the couch asks.

「It’s trivial! It’s trivial!」the standing guy says, and he rapidly reels off a series of logical steps:「First you assume thus-and-so, then we have Kerchoff’s this-and-that; then there’s Waffenstoffer’s Theorem, and we substitute this and construct that. Now you put the vector which goes around here and then thus-and-so . . .」The guy on the couch is struggling to understand all this stuff, which goes on at high speed for about fifteen minutes!

Finally the standing guy comes out the other end, and the guy on the couch says,「Yeah, yeah. It’s trivial.」

We physicists were laughing, trying to figure them out. We decided that「trivial」means「proved.」So we joked with the mathematicians:「We have a new theorem–that mathematicians can prove only trivial theorems, because every theorem that’s proved is trivial.」

The mathematicians didn’t like that theorem, and I teased them about it. I said there are never any surprises– that the mathematicians only prove things that are obvious.

Topology was not at all obvious to the mathematicians. There were all kinds of weird possibilities that were「counterintuitive.」Then I got an idea. I challenged them:「I bet there isn’t a single theorem that you can tell me–what the assumptions are and what the theorem is in terms I can understand–where I can’t tell you right away whether it’s true or false.」

It often went like this: They would explain to me,「You’ve got an orange, OK? Now you cut the orange into a finite number of pieces, put it back together, and it’s as big as the sun. True or false?」

「No holes?」

「No holes.」

「Impossible! There ain’t no such a thing.」

「Ha! We got him! Everybody gather around! It’s So-and-so’s theorem of immeasurable measure!」

Just when they think they’ve got me, I remind them,「But you said an orange! You can’t cut the orange peel any thinner than the atoms.」

「But we have the condition of continuity: We can keep on cutting!」

「No, you said an orange, so I _assumed_ that you meant a _real orange_.」

So I always won. If I guessed it right, great. If I guessed it wrong, there was always something I could find in their simplification that they left out.

Actually, there was a certain amount of genuine quality to my guesses. I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I’m trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For instance, the mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they’re all excited. As they’re telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something which fits all the conditions. You know, you have a set (one ball)–disjoint (two halls). Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head as they put more conditions on. Finally they state the theorem, which is some dumb thing about the ball which isn’t true for my hairy green ball thing, so I say,「False!」

If it’s true, they get all excited, and I let them go on for a while. Then I point out my counterexample.

「Oh. We forgot to tell you that it’s Class 2 Hausdorff homomorphic.」

「Well, then,」I say,「It’s trivial! It’s trivial!」By that time I know which way it goes, even though I don’t know what Hausdorff homomorphic means.

I guessed right most of the time because although the mathematicians thought their topology theorems were counterintuitive, they weren’t really as difficult as they looked. You can get used to the funny properties of this ultra-fine cutting business and do a pretty good job of guessing how it will come out.

Although I gave the mathematicians a lot of trouble, they were always very kind to me. They were a happy hunch of boys who were developing things, and they were terrifically excited about it. They would discuss their「trivial」theorems, and always try to explain something to you if you asked a simple question.

Paul Olum and I shared a bathroom. We got to be good friends, and he tried to teach me mathematics. He got me up to homotopy groups, and at that point I gave up. But the things below that I understood fairly well.

One thing I never did learn was contour integration. I had learned to do integrals by various methods shown in a book that my high school physics teacher Mr. Bader had given me.

One day he told me to stay after class.「Feynman,」he said,「you talk too much and you make too much noise. I know why. You’re bored. So I’m going to give you a book. You go up there in the back, in the corner, and study this book, and when you know everything that’s in this book, you can talk again.」

So every physics class, I paid no attention to what was going on with Pascal’s Law, or whatever they were doing. I was up in the back with this book: _Advanced Calculus_, by Woods. Bader knew I had studied _Calculus for the Practical Man_ a little bit, so he gave me the real works–it was for a junior or senior course in college. It had Fourier series, Bessel functions, determinants, elliptic functions–all kinds of wonderful stuff that I didn’t know anything about.

That book also showed how to differentiate parameters under the integral sign–it’s a certain operation. It turns out that’s not taught very much in the universities; they don’t emphasize it. But I caught on how to use that method, and I used that one damn tool again and again. So because I was self-taught using that book, I had peculiar methods of doing integrals.

The result was, when guys at MIT or Princeton had trouble doing a certain integral, it was because they couldn’t do it with the standard methods they had learned in school. If it was contour integration, they would have found it; if it was a simple series expansion, they would have found it. Then I come along and try differentiating under the integral sign, and often it worked. So I got a great reputation for doing integrals, only because my box of tools was different from everybody else’s, and they had tried all their tools on it before giving the problem to me.

———– Mindreaders ———–

My father was always interested in magic and carnival tricks, and wanting to see how they worked. One of the things he knew about was mindreaders. When he was a little boy growing up in a small town called Patchogue, in the middle of Long Island, it was announced on advertisements posted all over that a mindreader was coining next Wednesday. The posters said that some respected citizens–the mayor, a judge, a banker–should take a five-dollar bill and hide it somewhere, and when the mindreader came to town, he would find it.

When he came, the people gathered around to watch him do his work. He takes the hands of the banker and the judge, who had hidden the five-dollar bill, and starts to walk down the street. He gets to an intersection, turns the corner, walks down another street, then another, to the correct house. He goes with them, always holding their hands, into the house, up to the second floor, into the right room, walks up to a bureau, lets go of their hands, opens the correct drawer, and there’s the five-dollar bill. Very dramatic!

In those days it was difficult to get a good education, so the mindreader was hired as a tutor for my father. Well, my father, after one of his lessons, asked the mindreader how he was able to find the money without anyone telling him where it was.

The mindreader explained that you hold onto their hands, loosely and as you move, you jiggle a little bit. You come to an intersection, where you can go forward, to the left, or to the right. You jiggle a little bit to the left, and if it’s incorrect, you feel a certain amount of resistance, because they don’t expect you to move that way. But when you move in the right direction, because they think you might he able to do it, they give way more easily and there’s no resistance. So you must always be jiggling a little bit, testing out which seems to be the easiest way.

My father told me the story and said he thought it would still take a lot of practice. He never tried it himself.

Later, when I was doing graduate work at Princeton, I decided to try it on a fellow named Bill Woodward. I suddenly announced that I was a mindreader, and could read his mind. I told him to go into the「laboratory」–a big room with rows of tables covered with equipment of various kinds, with electric circuits, tools, and junk all over the place–pick out a certain object, somewhere, and come out. I explained,「Now I’ll read your mind and take you right up to the object.」

He went into the lab, noted a particular object, and came out. I took his hand and started jiggling. We went down this aisle, then that one, right to the object. We tried it three times. One time I got the object right on–and it was in the middle of a whole hunch of stuff. Another time I went to the right place hut missed the object by a few inches–wrong object. The third time, something went wrong. But it worked better than I thought. It was very easy.

Some time after that, when I was about twenty-six or so, my father and I went to Atlantic City where they had various carnival things going on outdoors. While my father was doing some business, I went to see a mindreader. He was seated on the stage with his back to the audience, dressed in robes and wearing a great big turban. He had an assistant, a little guy who was running around through the audience, saying things like,「Oh, Great Master, what is the color of this pocketbook?」

「Blue!」says the master.

「And oh, Illustrious Sir, what is the name of this woman?」

「Marie!」

Some guy gets up:「What’s my name?」

「Henry.」

I get up and say,「What’s _my_ name?」

He doesn’t answer. The other guy was obviously a confederate, but I couldn’t figure out how the mindreader did the other tricks, like telling the color of the pocketbook. Did he wear earphones underneath the turban?

When I met up with my father, I told him about it. He said,「They have a code worked out, but I don’t know what it is. Let’s go back and find out.」

We went back to the place, and my father said to me,「Here’s fifty cents. Go get your fortune read in the booth back there, and I’ll see you in half an hour.」

I knew what he was doing. He was going to tell the man a story, and it would go smoother if his son wasn’t there going,「Ooh, ooh!」all the time. He had to get me out of the way.

When he came back he told me the whole code:「Blue is ‘Oh, Great Master,’ Green is ‘Oh, Most Knowledgeable One,’」and so forth. He explained,「I went up to him, afterwards, and told him I used to do a show in Patchogue, and we had a code, but it couldn’t do many numbers, and the range of colors was shorter. I asked him, ‘How do you carry so much information?’」

The mindreader was so proud of his code that he sat down and explained the _whole works_ to my father. My father was a salesman. He could set up a situation like that. I can’t do stuff like that.

——————— The Amateur Scientist ———————

When I was a kid I had a「lab.」It wasn’t a laboratory in the sense that I would measure, or do important experiments.

Instead, I would play: I’d make a motor, I’d make a gadget that would go off when something passed a photocell. I’d play around with selenium; I was piddling around all the time. I did calculate a little bit for the lamp bank, a series of switches and bulbs I used as resistors to control voltages. But all that was for application. I never did any laboratory kind of experiments.

I also had a microscope and _loved_ to watch things under the microscope.It took patience: I would get something under the microscope and I would watch it interminably. I saw many interesting things, like everybody sees–a diatom slowly making its way across the slide, and so on.

One day I was watching a paramecium and I saw something that was not described in the books I got in school–in college, even. These books always simplify things so the world will be more like _they_ want it to be: When they’re talking about the behavior of animals, they always start out with,「The paramecium is extremely simple; it has a simple behavior. It turns as its slipper shape moves through the water until it hits something, at which time it recoils, turns through an angle, and then starts out again.」

It isn’t really right. First of all, as everybody knows, the paramecia, from time to time, conjugate with each other– they meet and exchange nuclei. How do they decide when it’s time to do that? (Never mind; that’s not my observation.)

I watched these paramecia hit something, recoil, turn through an angle, and go again. The idea that it’s mechanical, like a computer program–it doesn’t look that way. They go different distances, they recoil different distances, they turn through angles that are different in various cases; they don’t always turn to the right; they’re very irregular. It looks random, because you don’t know what they’re hitting; you don’t know all the chemicals they’re smelling, or what.

One of the things I wanted to watch was what happens to the paramecium when the water that it’s in dries up. It was claimed that the paramecium can dry up into a sort of hardened seed. I had a drop of water on the slide under my microscope, and in the drop of water was a paramecium and some「grass」–at the scale of the paramecium, it looked like a network of jackstraws. As the drop of water evaporated, over a time of fifteen or twenty minutes, the paramecium got into a tighter and tighter situation: there was more and more of this back-and-forth until it could hardly move. It was stuck between these「sticks,」almost jammed.

Then I saw something I had never seen or heard of: the paramecium lost its shape. It could flex itself, like an amoeba. It began to push itself against one of the sticks, and began dividing into two prongs until the division was about halfway up the paramecium, at which time it decided _that_ wasn’t a very good idea, and backed away.

So my impression of these animals is that their behavior is much too simplified in the books. It is not so utterly mechanical or one-dimensional as they say. They should describe the behavior of these simple animals correctly. Until we see how many dimensions of behavior even a one-celled animal has, we won’t be able to fully understand the behavior of more complicated animals.

I also enjoyed watching hugs. I had an insect book when I was about thirteen. It said that dragonflies are not harmful; they don’t sting. In our neighborhood it was well known that「darning needles,」as we called them, were very dangerous when they’d sting. So if we were outside somewhere playing baseball, or something, and one of these things would fly around, everybody would run for cover, waving their arms, yelling,「A darning needle! A darning needle!」

So one day I was on the beach, and I’d just read this book that said dragonflies don’t sting. A darning needle came along, and everybody was screaming and running around, and I just sat there.「Don’t worry!」I said.「Darning needles don’t sting!」

The thing landed on my foot. Everybody was yelling and it was a big mess, because this darning needle was sitting on my foot, And there I was, this scientific wonder, saying it wasn’t going to sting me.

You’re _sure_ this is a story that’s going to come out that it stings me–but it didn’t. The book was right. But I did sweat a bit.

I also had a little hand microscope. It was a toy microscope, and I pulled the magnification piece out of it, and would hold it in my hand like a magnifying glass, even though it was a microscope of forty or fifty power. With care you could hold the focus. So I could go around and look at things right out in the street.
