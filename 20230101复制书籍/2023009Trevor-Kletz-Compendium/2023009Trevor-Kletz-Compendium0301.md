## 0301. Inherent Safety

### 3.1 Introduction

What you don’t have, can’t leak

This is the title of a paper written by Kletz in 1978 [1]. It was pivotal in the development of inherent safety. Although Kletz says that he did not develop the original idea it is very clear that he did a great deal to advance and promote it to the point today where it is widely accepted as a fundamental safety concept.

Kletz was such a prolific author that he continued to develop his thoughts and examples on inherent safety in many publications. One aim with this chapter has been to draw together many of these into one place, including Kletz’s thoughts on how the absence of inherent safety led to major incidents in the process industries including Flixborough and Bhopal, and other industries including the space shuttle Challenger disaster.

Prompted by Kletz, many other people and organisations have worked on understanding what inherent safety is and how it can be applied. Another aim of this chapter has been to summarise current thoughts on the subject with particular emphasis on practical application.

Inherent safety is a design concept that is best addressed by multifunctional teams in a rigorous and systematic way. This is particularly important where systems or decisions are complex or cross the boundaries of responsibility of different discipline engineers. It is most effective when applied at the earliest stage of any project. Applying inherent safety concepts to an existing system is more difficult and often impractical, but it can still be considered. For example, when specifying or evaluating safety systems it is very useful to recognise the extent to which the design has achieved inherent safety and hence the gap that needs to be filled with the system. Also, when planning work on a system (e.g. maintenance) the principles of inherent safety can be used to define the preparation and safest methods to use.

#### 3.1.1 History of inherent safety

A good summary of the history of inherently safer design is provided in the book Kletz wrote with Paul Amyotte on the subject [2]. It suggests that examples can be observed over many years, long before it was recognised as a concept. Kletz provided the following example [2].

Text Box 3.1

One example of inherently safer design is from the 1870s. In the early days of the Solvay process for the manufacture of sodium carbonate, a manhole at the top of each batch distillation column had to be opened and solid lime tipped in every time the column was charged. Because ammonia vapour could escape, this operation was hazardous. Ludwig Mond suggested that milk of lime should be pumped into the columns instead. However, it was not until 100years later that inherently safer design was recognised as a specific concept and engineers began to consider it systematically.

Kletz described how he first developed ideas of inherent safety in the early 1970s [3].

Text Box 3.2

One of the papers presented at the conference was a now classical paper by N.A.R. Bell on the manufacture of nitro-glycerine (Loss Prevent in the Process Industries, Symposium Series No 34, Institution of Chemical Engineers, Rugby, 1971, P50). In the old method (illustrated below) acid and glycerine were mixed in a large stirred reactor holding about a ton of raw materials and product watched over by an operator on a one-legged stool. If the temperature got too hot the reactor exploded, taking the operator with it. The reactor was so large because the reaction was slow. Once the molecules came together they reacted quickly. The reaction appeared to be slow because the mixing was poor. Once this was realised it became possible to design a small, well-mixed reactor with the same output as the old one but containing only about a kilogram. The new reactor resembled a laboratory water pump. A stream of acid sucked in the glycerine through a side arm and by the time the mixture left the reactor the reaction was complete. The residence time fell from an hour to a couple of minutes. The maximum size of an explosion was greatly reduced, not by adding on protective equipment that might fail or be neglected but by the inherent or intrinsic nature of the process: what you don’t have, can’t explode. I was later to quote this paper as an excellent example of inherently safer design—that is, design that are safe because of their nature rather than made safe by adding on layers of protection.

Kletz referred to the paper by Bell on many occasions and illustrated how philosophies have changed with the very famous photo of a plant operator sitting on a one legged stool, peering into a reactor. The purpose of the stool had been that if the operator fell asleep he would start to fall, which would wake him up. This was necessary because it was recognised that monitoring the reaction taking place was essential to avoid accidents.

But Kletz said he did not really formulate his thoughts on inherent safety immediately. It took him a few years from reading the paper by Bell for him to recognise its potential and relevance [2].

Text Box 3.3

A few times in a lifetime, like a single stone setting off a landslide, a single remark makes one look at a whole range of problems in an entirely different way. Kantyka’s remark had this effect on me, though the seed he sowed did not germinate until the explosion at Flixborough 4years later. There were many lessons to be learned from this explosion, but one of the most important was missed by the official inquiry and by most commentators: The leak was big (about 50 tons) and the explosion devastating because there was so much flammable material in the plant (about 400 tons). If the inventory could be reduced, the plant would be safer: What you don’t have, can’t leak. The inventory was so large because the conversion was low, about 6% per pass, and so most of the raw material, cyclohexane, had to be recovered and recycled; 94% of it got a ‘free ride’ through the plant—in fact many ‘free rides’. If the conversion could be increased, the inventory would be lower.

After this Kletz published his "What you don’t have, can’t leak" paper [1], which represented a fundamental shift in hazard management towards building safety into the fundamental design of process plants as opposed to adding protective systems to control hazards.

#### 3.1.2 Definitions

It is probably fair to say that inherent safety is a concept rather than a clearly defined method or approach. This may explain why the development of a universally agreed definition has not been straight forward.

3.1.2.1 Kletz’s definition

Whilst Kletz wrote a lot about the subject, he does not appear to have used a specific definition of inherent safety. One of the closest attempts appears in his autobiography [3] where he says the main concept is that "it is better to remove a hazard than to keep it under control."

A potentially confusing aspect is that Kletz tended to use the term ‘user-friendly design’ almost synonymously with ‘inherently safer design’. This appears to be a recognition that total elimination of hazard is not possible and so a range of options should be considered to achieve the best overall effect.

3.1.2.2 Definition from CCPS

The US Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) spent several years developing and refining its definitions of inherent safety. The journey taken is an interesting one because it gets to the heart of what inherently safer design is about.

• 2007 [4]—"Inherently safer - a condition in which the hazards associated with the materials and operations used in the process have been reduced or eliminated, and this reduction or elimination is permanent and inseparable from the process."

• 2009 [5]—"Inherent safety is a concept, an approach to safety that focuses on eliminating or reducing the hazards associated with a set of conditions. A chemical manufacturing 

process is inherently safer if it reduces or eliminates the hazards associated with materials and operations used in the process and this reduction or elimination is permanent and inseparable."

• 2010 [6]—"Inherently Safer Technology (IST), also known as Inherently Safer Design (ISD), permanently eliminates or reduces hazards to avoid or reduce the consequences of incidents. IST is a philosophy, applied to the design and operation lifecycle, including manufacture, transport, storage, use, and disposal. IST is an iterative process that considers such options, including eliminating a hazard, reducing a hazard, substituting a less hazardous material, using less hazardous process conditions, and designing a process to reduce the potential for, or consequences of, human error, equipment failure, or intentional harm. Overall safe design and operation options cover a spectrum from inherent through passive, active and procedural risk management strategies. There is no clear boundary between IST and other strategies."

The 2007 definition [4] is attractively simple. A key feature is that the reduction or elimination of the hazard is an intrinsic part of the process and not an added layer of protection. This is probably the most critical feature of the concept and lies at the heart of inherently safer design.

The longer and more complex 2009 definition [5] did not really add much. However, in the same publication [5] it was highlighted that inherent safety is separate from other categories of risk reduction, which may involve passive, active, and procedural controls. This was a useful clarification.

The 2010 definition [6] was clearly more comprehensive than others. Key features include:

• Inherent safety is within a spectrum of risk reduction strategies, which also includes passive, active, and procedural controls,

• There is no clear boundary between inherently safe approaches and the others but passive, active, and procedural controls are different and separate.

• Inherent safety is permanent and inseparable from the process, whereas passive, active, and procedural controls are additional control measures;

• Inherent safety should not be considered in a vacuum but instead balanced with other decision-making criteria, especially where there is significant cost or technical risk.

The final point earlier is also mirrored in UK regulations by the concept of ALARP—As Low As Reasonably Practicable, which is covered later in this chapter.

美国的化工过程安全中心（CCPS）投入了好几年来定义和优化「本质安全性」的定义。这个探索过程很引人入胜，因为它触及到了本质安全设计的核心思想。

2007 年 [4] —— 本质安全是化工过程中的一种，与物料和操作有关的危险被减少或消除的一种状态，这种减少或消除是永久性的且与化工过程紧密相关。

2009 年 [5] —— 本质安全的概念，是一种以消除或减少某一系列条件下的危险为目标的安全策略。如果在一个化工过程中，与物料和操作有关的危险被减少或消除是永久性的且与化工过程紧密相关的话，那么这个化工生产过程就是本质安全的。

2010 年 [6] —— 本质安全技术（IST），也被称为本质安全设计（ISD），永久地消除或减少危险以避免或减少事故的后果。IST 是一种哲学，应用于设计和操作的整个生命周期，包括制造、运输、储存、使用和处置。IST 是一个迭代的过程，该过程涵盖了诸如消除危险、减少危险、替换成危险更新的物料、使用危险性更小的操作条件，以及设计过程以减少人为错误、设备故障或事故伤害的可能性或后果。总体而言，安全设计和操作涵盖了从固有到被动、主动和程序性风险管理策略的整个范围。IST 和其他策略之间没有明确的界限。

2007 年的定义 [4] 简洁明了。一个关键特点是，危险的减少或消除是过程的固有部分，而不是额外添加的保护层。这可能是本质安全概念最关键的特征，并且是本质安全设计的核心。

更长和更复杂的 2009 年定义 [5] 实际上没有增加太多。然而，同一文献 [5] 中明确了，与被动、主动和程序性控制相比，本质安全是一个独立的风险减少策略。这是一个有用的澄清。

2010 年的定义 [6] 更为全面和详细。核心观点有：

本质安全是一种减少危险风险的策略，其他策略还包括被动、主动和程序控制。

本质安全与其他减少风险策略之间没有明确的界限，但是与被动、主动和程序性控制是不同且独立的。

1『与 HAZOP 串起来了，可以叠加一起用。』

本质安全性是与过程永久和不可分割的，而被动、主动和程序控制是额外的控制措施；

本质安全性不应该孤立地考虑，而应该与其他决策标准进行权衡，特别是在存在显著成本或技术风险的情况下。

最后一点早些时候也在英国的规定中有所反映，即「尽量低的合理可行水平」（ALARP）的概念，这将在本章后面进行介绍。



3.1.2.3 Definition from the UK Health and Safety Executive

Through his association with Loughborough University, Kletz co-authored a report for the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on the subject of improving inherent safety [7]. This included the following definition:

Text Box 3.4

An ‘inherently safe’ approach to hazard management is one that tries to avoid or eliminate hazards, or reduce their magnitude, severity or likelihood of occurrence, by careful attention to the fundamental design and layout. Less reliance is placed on ‘add-on’ engineered safety systems and features, and procedural controls, which can and do fail.

FIG. 3.1

Inherent safety is not a single change but a package of improvements.

3.1.2.4 Definition from the Energy Institute In its guidance on applying inherently safe design (ISD) [8] the UK’s Energy Institute included the following in its foreword.

Traditional process safety approaches have often required ‘add-on’ risk safety systems that are costly to install and maintain. By comparison, ISD provides the opportunity to eliminate hazards or reduce their severity or likelihood by better design, with the potential of reducing overall capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX). ISD should promote a culture of challenging the need for designs that rely on ‘add-on’ safety systems, by confirming why they are needed, and how the need could be avoided by improving the basic process design.

3.1.3 The benefits of inherent safety

Kletz was very clear on what he saw to be the benefits of inherent safety [9] (Fig. 3.1).

Text Box 3.5

How much money would we save it we did not have to contain such large inventories or could use safer materials? No one knows. No one keeps separate costs for safety. It is not something added afterwards like a coat of paint, but it is an integral part of the design. If a design engineer is asked the cost of the safety features in his plant he tends to list the newer features which were subject to debate. But he does not include traditional safety features such as relief valves, or even the cost of all the alarms and trips. These features he takes for granted.

As a guess, perhaps 5% of the capital cost could be saved if we could reduce our expenditure on added-on protective equipment such trips, alarms, emergency valves, leak and fire detectors, insulation, water drenching and fire-fighting equipment.

More important would be reductions in the cost of maintaining the equipment and systems. A lot of protective instrumentation means a lot of skilled manpower has to be employed for maintenance and testing. A lot of management time has to be taken up or should be taken up—by monitoring to make sure that equipment is operated and maintained to the necessary standard. Obviously this

effort cannot be eliminated completely. But if plants can be made inherently safer, then the effort can be reduced.

Also, it will be easier to persuade the central and local authorities that a plant will not blow up or poison the neighbourhood. It will be easier to find a location for the plant and the equipment may not have to be spread so far apart.

If inventories can be reduced, probably the biggest saving, will not come from a reduction in the amount of protective equipment needed or the effort required to maintain it. Rather, it will come from a reduction in the size of the plant items together with the consequent reduction in structures to support them and land to accommodate them.

Text Box 3.6

When I worked in industry, my research colleagues sometimes complained about the high cost of extrinsic safety features. They suggested that by recommending so much ‘added-on’ safety, I was making their processes uneconomic. My reply was that ‘added-on’ safety was necessary because they invented such poor processes—poor in other ways beside safety. It is not economic to push large inventories round and round. If they could invent better processes we would not need to add so much safety equipment.

### 3.2 The concept of inherent safety

Whilst there is consistency between the various definitions listed earlier, do they convey the true principles of inherent safety? In many ways it is easier to understand it by having a better grasp of the aims and objectives.

Kletz summed up his views of the concept of inherent safety as follows [10].

Text Box 3.7

The essence of the inherently safer approach to plant design is the avoidance of hazards rather than their control by added protective equipment. Although we generally think of safety in a comparative sense, one experienced practitioner a has made the distinction between safe design and safer design. He explains that with safe design, there are active safeguards to prevent the occurrence of hazardous events and to protect people and plant from the effects. With safer design, there are fewer hazards, fewer causes, and fewer people to be exposed to the effects.

a G. Dalzell, Inherently safety design: changing attitudes and relationships. Seventh International Conference on Health, Safety and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production. Canada Society of Petroleum Engineers. 2004.

But in true Kletz style he illustrated this concept with some very simple but effective statements:

1. "What you don’t have, can’t leak"

2. "People who are not there can’t be killed"

3. "The more complicated a system becomes, the more opportunities there are for equipment failure and human error"

Kletz’s explanation of these concepts and how he relates them to industrial accidents helps us to understand the thoughts that drove the definitions used commonly in industry.

3.2.1 What you don’t have, can’t leak

This statement represents a very significant step in both Kletz’s and industry’s understanding of inherent safety and why it is so important. He explained what it means in practice [11].

Text Box 3.8

The best way of preventing a leak of hazardous material is to use so little that it does not matter if it all leaks out, or to use a safer material instead. We cannot always find ways of doing this but once we start looking for them we find a surprisingly large number.

Until the explosion at Flixborough, UK in 1974, which killed 28 employees the attitude in the process industries was, ‘There is no need to worry about large stocks of hazardous materials as we know how to keep them under control’. Flixborough weakened that confidence and 10years later the toxic gas release at Bhopal, India, which killed over 2000 members of the public, almost destroyed it. Since then companies, to varying extents and with varying degrees of success, have tried to reduce their stocks of hazardous materials in storage and process.

To do so requires a major change in the design process: much more consideration of alternative in the early stages of design, and this will not occur without encouragement and support from the senior levels of management.

3.2.1.1 Flixborough accident

On 1 June 1974 the Flixborough chemical plant in North Lincolnshire, UK exploded killing 28 people and seriously injuring 36. The plant site produced caprolactam, a chemical used in the manufacture of nylon. The explosion occurred due to pipework failure that led to a release of highly flammable cyclohexane.

The normal focus on this accident is the failure to manage plant modifications but Kletz also used it to discuss the role of inherent safety [10].

Text Box 3.9

The explosion at Flixborough in 1974 occurred in a plant for the oxidation of cyclohexane with air, at about 150°C and a gauge pressure of about 10bar (150psi), to a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, usually known as KA (ketone/alcohol) mixture. It is a stage in the manufacture of nylon. The inventory in the plant was large (200–500tonne has been quoted) because the reaction was slow and the conversion low, the latter being about 6% per pass! Much of the inventory was held in six large continuous reactors operated in series, and the rest was held in the equipment for recovering the product and recycling the unconverted raw material.

The first stage of the reaction (hydroperoxide formation) was slow because mixing was poor. Conversion was kept low for the same reason. If the oxygen concentration in the liquid is high it can easily become too high where it leaves the gas sparger, and then unwanted side reactions (further oxidation of the cyclohexane) occur. A method of improving the mixing in gas/liquid reactors has been described. In most such reactors the gas is added through a sparger, and the liquid is stirred by a conventional stirrer. In the Litz design the gas is added to the vapour space, and a down-pumping impellor sucks the gas down and mixes it intimately with the liquid. Unreacted gas that escapes back into the vapour space is recirculated. The reactor was designed to increase output and efficiency, but compared with a conventional reactor less inventory is needed for a given output. Other methods of improving mixing are suggested. The second stage of the reaction, decomposition of the hydroperoxide, is inherently slow, and a long residence time is required. Could this be achieved in a tubular reactor as discussed above? Higher temperatures would increase the rate of decomposition.

Kletz went on to say that the inherently safe solution is not always obvious and can raise other issues that need to be considered. For example, addressing the issues with the second stage reaction would have required a new approach to heat removal. But if this had resulted in a significantly lower hazardous inventory the impact of any accident would have been greatly reduced.

Kletz also used Flixborough to highlight that there can be unintended consequences of changes, with transfer of risk being a particular concern [9].

Text Box 3.10

At one extreme, the ‘back to nature’ enthusiasts suggest we abandon man-made fibres and go back to the use of wood, wool and cotton. They overlook the fact that the ‘accident content’ of natural materials is higher than that of synthetic materials, though people are killed one at a time. (The price of any article is the price of the labour used to make it, capital costs being other people’s labour. Agriculture is a low wage industry so there will be more hours of labour in a wool or cotton shirt than in a synthetic fibre shirt of the same price. Because agriculture is also a high accident industry this means that there will be more fatal accidents per woollen or cotton shift than per nylon shirt.)

Given that the demand for nylon would remain, the occurrence of the accident prompted a review of how it could be made more safely. Kletz shows how the chosen solution probably raised as many questions as it answered [9].

Text Box 3.11

An example often quoted of an inherently safer route is the manufacture of a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, usually known as KA or ketone-aldehyde mixture. It is an intermediate in the manufacture of nylon. At Flixborough it was manufactured by the air oxidation of cyclohexane. A leak from the plant, the result of a substandard modification, exploded, destroying the plant and killing 28 people. When the plant was rebuilt cyclohexanol was manufactured by an alternative route, the hydrogenation of phenol. This is a vapour phase process and a much less hazardous one than the oxidation route KA. However, the phenol has to be manufactured, usually by the oxidation of cumene to cumene hydroperoxide and its ‘cleavage’ to phenol and acetone. This process is at least as hazardous as, perhaps more hazardous than, the oxidation of cyclohexane and as much extrinsic safety equipment is required. It was not carried out at Flixborough but elsewhere. There was less hazard on the Flixborough site, but no reduction in the total hazard of the process.

3.2.1.2 Bhopal

Kletz was very clear on his views on the Bhopal disaster and how even a basic understanding of inherent safety would have made a great difference to the consequences [12].

Text Box 3.12

Methyl isocyanate, the material that leaked and killed over 2000 people, was not a raw material or product but an intermediate. It was convenient to store it but not essential to do so. If it had been made continuously and used as it was made, the worst possible leak would have been a few kilograms from a ruptured pipeline. After Bhopal many companies did reduce their stocks of hazardous intermediates. Alternatively, the production of methyl isocyanate could have been avoided by reacting the three raw materials in a different order.

3.2.1.3 Ammonia as a refrigerant

Ammonia is commonly used as a refrigerant, but it is a severe irritant and human exposure can be fatal. In one accident 15 people were killed when liquid ammonia leaked from a refrigeration plant in Shanghai [13]. The leak was caused when a cap on a pipeline carrying ammonia was detached. Although the investigation concluded that the company concerned had not conformed to safety requirements it was clear that use of another, less hazardous refrigerant would have had less severe consequences.

Unfortunately alternative refrigerants such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), that were used in domestic refrigerators because they are safer to people, were subsequently found to be very hazardous to the environment and have been banned internationally. This highlights the challenges of inherent safety. In this case there is a requirement to weigh up safety and environmental risks [13].

3.2.2 People who are not there can’t be killed

Whilst hazard elimination will always be the most effective measure, Kletz was very well aware that this was not always possible or desirable. With this in mind he pointed out that keeping people away from hazardous areas can be very effective at reducing the consequences of any accidents that occur [11].

Text Box 3.13

Justasmaterialwhichisnottherecannotleak,peoplewhoarenottherecannotbekilled.Thosekilled at Bhopal were living in a shanty town which had grown up close to the plant. Earlier the same year 542 people were killed in a BLEVE in Mexico City. Most were living in a shanty town near the plant.

It is difficult in some countries to control development. Nevertheless plants handling large amounts of hazardous materials should not be built unless concentrations of people can be kept well away. Fortunately disasters such as Bhopal can occur in only a few plants and industries but the principle of segregation applies everywhere. By sensible lay-out—for example, by keeping people and traffic apart or by not putting a workshop near a unit that might explode—we can reduce the chance that someone will be killed or injured.

Using Bhopal and Mexico City accidents as examples of keeping people outside of the hazardous area implies that this is only a concern for people living, working, and visiting places near to, but external to the site. In countries with effective arrangements for land use planning this is handled by regulations. Unfortunately this does not apply in all countries and companies can have little control over who could be exposed to the hazards they handle. However, companies do have control over who enters their site and where they work and visit. Understanding the hazardous areas and rearranging the site and working arrangements can be effective at reducing the potential consequences of an accident.

3.2.2.1 Piper Alpha The fires and explosions at the Piper Alpha oil platform in July 1988 led to the deaths of 167 people partly because there was a single structure that housed equipment used for processing hydrocarbons, a range of work spaces, and the accommodation for the people working there. Although some protection had been provided in the form of fire walls, these proved to be ineffective due to the scale of the incident.

Multijacketed (a ‘jacket’ is the structure which supports an offshore platform) facilities have become far more prevalent in the offshore oil and gas industry. These provide different structures to separate accommodation including offices from the hydrocarbon. They do not eliminate the exposure to the hazard because people still have to visit the other jacket to do their work but if there were to be an incident there would be fewer people present and they have a permanent means of escape to a safer location.

3.2.2.2 BP Texas City refinery accident

Most of the 15 people killed as a result of the explosion and fire at the Texas City refinery in 2005 were located in a temporary building (referred to as a ‘trailer’ in the United States). The plant was being started up at the time of the accident, which is known to be a vulnerable time due to process instability as fluids are introduced and pressures, temperatures, and flows are increased. Due to the increased risk it would have been prudent to have removed all personnel from the buildings whilst the start-up was taking place. However, the inherently safer solution would have been to locate the building at a safe distance from the plant. In this case it may have not been considered necessary because the building was only temporary, but this accident clearly highlights the danger of this approach.

3.2.2.3 Corden pharmachem fatal accident On 28 April 2008 a runaway chemical reaction caused distortion of a pressure rated reactor and led to a loss of containment, which created a blast wave sufficient to kill one person, seriously injure another, and cause significant physical damage [14]. The accident highlighted a number of failures that build the case for inherent safety, including the runaway occurring because a solvent (acetone) was omitted in error and the installed relief valves not being able to cope. However, people were harmed because, when a runaway reaction was detected, it was necessary for operators to enter the plant area to shut manual valves [14]. If remotely operated valves had been available these people could have remained in a safer location and may not have been harmed when the reactor failed.

3.2.3 The more complicated a system becomes, the more opportunities there are for equipment failure and human error

This final concept due to Kletz was a recognition that complexity can be a cause of problems [11].

Text Box 3.14

The usual response to this statement is that complication is inevitable today. Sometimes it may be, but not always; There are many ways in which plants have been made simpler, and thus cheaper and safer. As with the reduction of stocks, the constraints are often procedural rather than technical. We cannot simplify a design if we wait until it is far advanced; we have to consider alternatives in a structured and systematic way during the early stages of design.

Kletz highlighted that one of the causes of complexity is the safety systems added to hazardous systems [11].

Text Box 3.15

Many plants contain a large amount of hazardous materials. We try to keep it under control by adding on trips and alarms and other protective equipment which may fail or can be neglected. It would be better to devise processes and equipment that use less hazardous material, so that it does not matter if it all leaks out, or safer materials instead.

A quote that sums up this concern about complexity was made in relation to software design [15]. It is interesting to note that this was said in 1980, when by today’s standards the computer technology was so much simpler:

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature.

3.2.3.1 Avoiding static discharges

On 29 October 2007 a fire and series of explosions occurred at the Barton Solvents chemical distribution facility in Des Moines, Iowa, United States. The investigation concluded that a vapour–air mixture was ignited due to static discharge (spark) occurring between the body of a ‘tote’ tank being filled with ethyl acetate and a metal component of the equipment being used for filling [16].

Many things can be done to reduce the likelihood of static discharges including ensuring proper electrical bonding and/or grounding of equipment and controlling flow rate. However, splash filling a vessel (as was the case in this accident) means it is always possible. A more inherently safe option is to avoid splash filling by using a dip pipe that can be inserted into the top but will reach to the bottom of the vessel. This will avoid splashing and hence the generation of static [16] (Fig. 3.2).

FIG. 3.2

Image from CSB report [16] showing how to avoid splash filling and reduce risk of static.

3.2.3.2 Chevron Richmond refinery

On 6 August 2012 a catastrophic pipe rupture in a crude unit at the Chevron USA Inc. Refinery in Richmond, California, United States resulted in a large fire that engulfed 19 workers. All managed to escape with six experiencing minor injuries [17].

The pipe ruptured due to sulphidic corrosion, which occurs when steel is exposed to sulphur compounds at certain temperature ranges. It is a well-known phenomenon in refineries due to the sulphur content of crude oil and is avoided by using appropriate materials of construction wherever the risk justifies it. When initially designed, the pipe that failed in this accident was not considered to pose a significant risk due to the types of crude expected to be processed and so was constructed from carbon steel. However, operating conditions changed over the life of the refinery and the risk of sulphidic corrosion increased. This had been recognised by some people within Chevron, who recommended increased inspection regimes. This would have been a complex undertaking and was not implemented [17].

In this case implementing an inherently safer design by selecting materials of construction that would be resistant to sulphidic corrosion would have simplified management of changes to process conditions and would not have required any increased inspection regimes above those considered ‘normal’ in a refinery.

### 3.3 Principles of inherent safety

Whilst the concepts described earlier were effective at illustrating why inherent safety was important they did not give such a clear idea of how it can be achieved in practice. To do this Kletz developed the following set of principles:

• Intensification—lower inventories of hazardous materials;

• Substitution—use a less hazardous substance;

• Attenuation—use less hazardous conditions;

• Limitations of effects—design to minimise or withstand hazardous circumstances so that there is less reliance on additional protective devices;

• Simplicity—less equipment that can fail, and equipment design that is easier to understand and operate as intended (so human error is less likely).

These principles remain evident today although some of the terminology has changed. In particular ‘intensification’ has been replaced by ‘minimisation’ and ‘attenuation’ has been replaced by ‘moderation’.

Other principles have been introduced. For example, a list from the Energy Institute [8] includes ‘elimination’ and ‘segregation’, which do not appear on Kletz’s list.

3.3.1 Intensification or minimisation

The aim here is to perform the same activity with smaller quantities of hazardous material or performing an activity less often [8]. Kletz illustrated this principle with the following image [9] (Fig. 3.3).

FIG. 3.3

Intensify to increase inherent safety.

Kletz provided a number of examples of how intensification or minimisation can be applied in practice including [9]:

• Reducing reactor sizes by increasing reaction rates though improved mixing, increasing temperature or pressure, or switching from liquid phase to vapour phase reactions;

• Reducing the size of distillation columns by selecting different types of packing or tray design, reducing the quantity of liquid by reducing the diameter of the column base in relation to higher up the column where vapour will be present, using internal auxiliaries such as reboiler or bottoms pumps, and considering other forms of separation;

• Reducing inventories in heat exchangers by selecting different design (e.g. printed circuit instead of shell and tube);

• Reducing inventories in liquid–liquid separation systems by using devices to promote coalescence; and

• Reducing quantities of materials stored, with the aim of eliminating all unnecessary intermediate storage.

Kletz provided the following comparisons of reactor design that sum up the types of considerations that should be made when looking for an inherently safer solution [9].

Text Box 3.16

No unit operation offers more scope for reduction of inventory than reaction. Many reactors, particularly liquid phase oxidation reactors, contain large inventories of hazardous materials and leaks from them have caused many fires and explosions, including that at Flixborough.

Reactors can be arranged in the following hierarchy of (usually) increasing inventory and decreasing inherent safety (Table 3.1).

Text Box 3.17

In a batch reactor, all the reactants are added before reaction starts. In a semibatch reactor, one (or more) of the reactants is added and the final reactants added gradually as reaction proceeds; reaction takes place at once, and an unreacted mixture cannot accumulate unless mixing fails or the catalyst is consumed.

TABLE 3.1

Hierarchy of reactor safety [2].

Vapour-phase reactors Liquid-phase reactors

Inventory decreases

Thin-film reactors Tubular reactors (once-through and loop) Continuous pot (stirred tank) reactors Semibatch reactors Batch reactors

Safety increases

Each process should be considered on its merits, for there are exceptions to the general rules. For example, according to Englundb , for the copolymerisation of styrene and butadiene, a semibatch reactor is safer than a batch one, but a continuous reactor may not be the safest because some designs contain more unreacted raw material than semibatch reactors.

When possible, vapour-phase reactors should be developed in place of liquid phase ones because the density of the vapour is less and the leak rate through a hole of a given size is lower. Of course, a gas at very high pressure with a density similar to that of a liquid is as hazardous as a liquid.

As a rule, reactors, of all types are large not because a large output is desired, but because conversion is low, reaction is slow, or both.

3.3.1.1 Incident caused by a shared water flushing system

Kletz shared the following example of where intensification or minimisation of the water supply to three gasifiers could have prevented an accident [18] (Fig. 3.4).

b S. Englund, Design and operate plant for inherent safety, Part 1. Chem Eng Progress 87. 1991.

Text Box 3.18

Another incident involving shared equipment occurred on an ammonia plant on which there were three parallel gasifiers, A, B and C. They were distinct units but a common 1in. (25mm) line supplied water at a gauge pressure of 63bar (910psi) for flushing out level indicators and level gauges. The plant operated at a gauge pressure of 54bar (780psi). Gasifiers A and C were on line and B was shut down for repair. A large amount of flushing water was used on C and the pressure in the water line near A and B fell below 54bar. Gas from A entered the water line, entered B through a leaking valve and came out inside B where it was ignited by a welding spark. Fortunately no one was injured. The connection from the water line to B gasifier had not been slip-plated as no one thought it possible for gas to enter by this route. Afterwards separate water lines were run to the three gasifiers.

3.3.2 Substitution

The aim here is to reduce the hazard severity by replacing a hazardous substance or a processing route with a less hazardous alternative. Another option is to replace a procedure with one that presents a lesser hazard [8] (Fig. 3.5).

Kletz provided a number of examples of how substitution can be applied in practice including [9]:

• Using safer agents that are less flammable, toxic, or reactive in services such as heat transfer or refrigeration, or as a solvent;

• Choosing a process that uses less hazardous materials or less hazardous operating conditions.

Kletz provided the following example of substituting a flammable hydrocarbon heating medium with water as an inherently safe solution [9].

Text Box 3.19

Flammable hydrocarbons or ethers are often used as heat-transfer media at pressures considerably above atmospheric. In some plants the inventory of the heat transfer system is several hundred tonnes and exceeds that in the process. Sometimes the heat transfer medium is heated in a furnace and supplies heat to a reactor or distillation column reboiler; sometimes it removes heat from a reactor and gives it up to water in a cooler, possibly raising steam.

When possible, we should use a higher boiling liquid or, better still, water. Though pressures will be higher than in a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon/ether system, the technology is well understood and if the heat-transfer medium is used to remove heat from a reactor, the heat is immediately available as steam which can usually be used elsewhere on the site.

3.3.2.1 Bhopal

The Bhopal tragedy highlights why inherent safety has to be considered for any hazardous process. Kletz discussed the substitution options that were available that could have prevented or significantly reduced the consequences [18] (Fig. 3.6).

Text Box 3.20

If reducing inventories, or intensification as it is called, is not practicable an alternative is substitution, that is, using a safer material or route. At Bhopal the product (carbaryl) was made from phosgene, methylamme and alpha-naphthol. The first two were reacted together to make MIC which was then reacted with alpha-naphthol. In an alternative process used by the Israeli company Makhteshim, alpha-naphthol and phosgene are reacted together to make a chloroformate ester what is then reacted with methylamine to make carbaryl. The same raw materials are used but MIC is not formed at all.

Of course, phosgene is also a hazardous material and its inventory should be kept as low as possible, or avoided altogether. If carbaryl can only be made via phosgene, perhaps another insecticide should be manufactured instead.

FIG. 3.6

Routes to making carbaryl.

Or instead of manufacturing pesticides perhaps we should achieve our objective—preventing the harm done by pests—in other ways, for example, by breeding pest-resistant plants or by introducing natural predators? I am not saying we should, both these suggestions have disadvantages, merely saying that the question should be asked.

3.3.2.2 Challenger space shuttle

On 28 January 1986 the Challenger Space Shuttle exploded killing all seven crew members. The direct cause was a failure of rubber O-rings that allowed fuel to escape from the rocket boosters. Kletz used this as an example of where a substitution of components could have prevented the accident and the difficulties of managing additional layers of protection if the most inherently safe option is not selected [18].

Text Box 3.21

NASA accepted the cheapest quotation for the design of the shuttle even though the casing would be made in parts. One of the four quotations was for a one-piece design, an inherently safer one as its integrity does not depend on additional pieces of equipment, seals, which are inevitably weaker in nature than the parts they join. The failure of one of these O-ring seals led to the loss of Challenger.

Realising that the O-rings were weak features, the designers decided to duplicate them. However, this did not give them the redundancy they thought it would as one ring in a pair may be gripped less tightly than the other one. The first flights showed that the O-rings became eroded but this caused little concern amongst the senior management. Development of a new design, a 27-month programme, was started but meanwhile the old design continued in use, for several reasons.

The O-ring option may have been cheaper but relied on additional controls. The quality of the O-rings installed required very close attention. Another factor that was not recognised or accepted was that O-ring reliability was affected by ambient temperatures. If the full cost of the quality control and the operational limits on ambient temperature had been properly accounted for it is likely that the apparently higher costs of the inherently safer solution may actually have been cheaper than the O-rings over the life of the Space Shuttle programme.

There were a number of cultural issues that resulted in Challenger being launched when the ambient temperature was too low, which resulted in the O-ring failure. This raises an interesting observation. Organisations with poor safety culture are least likely to recognise the importance of inherent safety. However, these same organisations have the most to gain in applying inherent safety because their poorer safety culture makes them more prone to operational failures. On the flip side, organisations with a better safety culture gain additional benefits because selecting inherently safer designs gives them more time to focus on managing their residual risks.

3.3.2.3 Substituting materials of construction

In April 2010 a heat exchanger ruptured at Tesoro’s Anacortes refinery in Washington State, United States resulting in a fire and explosion. Seven people died [19]. The rupture occurred due to a reduction in the strength of steel caused by High Temperature Hydrogen Attack (HTHA).

The investigation report [19] stated that "It is very difficult to inspect for HTHA because the damage might not be detected" and that "Successful identification of HTHA is highly dependent on the specific techniques employed and the skill of the inspector, and there are few inspectors who have this expertise. Inspection is therefore not sufficiently reliable to ensure mechanical integrity and prevent HTHA equipment damage." It went on to say that chromium steels are far more resistant to HTHA than carbon steel and that using it would have been an inherently safer solution and hence a much better solution. [19]

3.3.3 Attenuation or moderation

The aim here is to use a substance in a way that reduces its hazardous properties or to use less severe processing conditions [8]. Another way is to store or transport material in a less hazardous form. Kletz illustrated this principle with the following image [9] (Fig. 3.7).

Kletz provided a number of examples of attenuation [10]:

• Attenuate reactions by controlling the operating temperature to below where a runaway reaction can occur, replace a batch with a continuous reactor, where the improved mixing reduces the required contact time of the reagents, or select catalysts that allow reactions to take place at less severe operating conditions;

• Attenuated storage and transport can be achieved by transforming a hazardous powder into a paste, dissolving a hazardous material in a solvent, or liquefying via refrigeration instead of pressurisation.

Kletz gave the following explanation for using refrigeration over pressurisation [9].

FIG. 3.7

Attenuate to increase inherent safety.

Text Box 3.22

Large quantities of liquefied ammonia and chlorine are now usually stored refrigerated at atmospheric pressure, instead of being stored under pressure at atmospheric temperature. If there is a hole in the plant, the quantity discharged is much less; if there is a large spillage, the amount of vapour produced is much less.

3.3.4 Limitations of effects

The aim here is to design equipment and processes so that the effects of equipment, control system, or human failures are limited [10]. Kletz gave the following examples:

• Equipment design—spiral-wound gaskets that leak at a lower rate than fibre gaskets, dikes, or bunds having higher walls so that they can have a smaller surface and hence lower evaporation rate of spilt liquid, not overdesigning pipework so that held-up inventories are always minimised;

• Changing reaction conditions—carrying out different stages of a reaction in different vessels if this reduces the potential for incompatible materials to be mixed, ensuring reagents are added to a reactor in a way that minimises the potential for hazardous reactions, changing temperature, concentration, or another parameter;

• Limiting the energy available—using a heating medium that is incapable of overheating the process, and so reducing the risk of fire or runaway reaction, using pumps with discharge pressure less than the receiving vessel’s design pressure or relief valve setting;

• Elimination of hazards—using fully flooded drainage systems that do not have a vapour space that can create a flammable atmosphere, using submerged pumps directly inside tanks to remove the need for a pump room, moving all potential ignition sources to outside a flammable hazard area, reducing the number of samples taken to only those necessary, reducing maintenance frequency through better design and planning.

3.3.4.1 Flixborough and Bhopal Kletz again used the Flixborough and Bhopal accidents to highlight how inherent safety could have been applied, in this case by reducing the consequence through limitations of effect [18].

Text Box 3.23

It is almost impossible to prevent ignition of a leak the size of that which occurred at Flixborough. (Not all such leaks ignite, but it is often a matter of chance which ones do or do not.) The leak may spread until it reaches a source of ignition. However, it is possible to locate and lay out a plant so that injuries and damage are minimised if an explosion occurs. Most of the men who were killed were in the control room and were killed by the collapse of the building on them.

Is it right to protect the men in the control room and ignore those who are outside? At Flixborough most of those outside survived. Men in an ordinary unreinforced building are at greater risk than those outside.

We now move to the Bhopal incident.

Text Box 3.24

If materials which are not there cannot leak, people who are not there cannot be killed. The death toll at Bhopal would have been much smaller if unauthorised developments had not been allowed to grow up near the plant. In many countries planning controls prevent such developments, but not apparently in India.

It is easy to casually and wrongly think that these problems at Bhopal were because it happened in India and would not have occurred in a wealthier or more developed country. However, Kletz stated [18]:

Text Box 3.25

In one respect the managing director of Union Carbide, India showed more awareness that his US colleagues: he queried the need for so much MIC storage but was overruled.

3.3.4.2 Sterigenics ethylene oxide explosion

Ethylene oxide is widely used as a sterilising agent but it presents a particularly serious explosion hazard. This has become more of an issue as a result of increasingly stringent requirements for pollution control [20].

On 19 August 2004 and explosion occurred at the Sterigenics International Inc. sterilisation facility in Ontario, California, United States. Four workers were injured and the facility was severely damaged [21]. It occurred when a door to a steriliser was opened prematurely, which admitted air and allowed an explosion mixture with ethylene oxide to form. A computer control system was supposed to prevent this occurrence but it was overridden by maintenance personnel. This highlights how safety systems can always be defeated and so emphasises the value of applying inherent safety wherever possible.

In this case, using a less hazardous sterilisation agent would have been preferred. But this will not always be possible. The potential for explosion should always be a concern due to the flammability of ethylene oxide. Active devices can be used for detecting hazards and initiating an appropriate response, but of course these can fail. Passive devices would be inherently safer. In this case flame arrestors have been proven to be effective at stopping explosions and specially designed valves are available that do not allow explosions to propagate [20].

3.3.5 Simplicity or simplification

The aim here is to reduce the likelihood of an accident through inherent features of the design. This can involve designing processes, equipment, and procedures to eliminate opportunities for failure, including human error; also, designing equipment that cannot be exposed to extreme process conditions by the worst-case processing conditions [8]. Kletz illustrated this principle with the following image [9] (Fig. 3.8).

FIG. 3.8

Simplify to increase inherent safety.

Kletz felt that complexity occurs because inherently safer designs are not adopted and so additional safety devices have to be added. This becomes a particular issue if safety studies are performed late in the design process because the opportunity to adopt an inherently safer design has already been missed. He gave the following examples of simplification [9]:

• Using stronger equipment so that relief devices are not required;

• Using materials resistant to harsh conditions (e.g. extreme temperature, corrosivity) so that reliance on operating procedures and safety systems is reduced;

• Simplifying system arrangements so that the likelihood of human error and vulnerability to instrumentation failures are reduced;

• Relocating potential ignition sources to outside of flammable hazard zones;

• Incorporating passive arrangements to avoid the need for active safety devices.

3.3.5.1 Esso Longford

Kletz shared the example of the explosion at Esso’s Longford site as an example of where inherent safety using simplification may have been beneficial [18].

Text Box 3.26

On 25 September 1998 a heat exchanger in the Esso gas plant in Longford, Victoria, Australia fractured, releasing hydrocarbon vapours and liquids. Explosions and a fire followed, killing two employees and injuring eight. Supplies of natural gas were interrupted throughout the State of Victoria and were not fully restored until 14 October. There was no alternative supply of gas and many industrial and domestic users were without fuel for all or part of the time that the plant was shut down.

[Information about this accident] is based on the official Reports and on a book by Andrew Hopkinsc . The Report is commendably thorough. It describes the operator failings that led to the explosion but does not blame the operators, as reports in earlier time might have done, but shows how the operators’ failings were the result of inadequate training and other management failures. In contrast, the weaknesses in design get less consideration.

c A. Hopkins. Lessons from Longford—The Esso Gas Plant Explosion. CCH Australia Limited (2001).

As the result of a plant upset the lean oil pump stopped and was not restarted for several hours. There was now no flow of warm lean oil through the heat exchanger and its temperature fell to that of the rich oil, À48°C. The Report describes in great detail the circumstances that led to the pump stopping but all pumps are liable to stop from time to time. There are many possible causes such as mechanical failure, loss of power supply, low level in the suction vessel and high level in the delivery vessel. All possible causes should be recognised and precautions taken. The precise reason why the flow stopped on 25 September 1998 is of secondary importance. Next time the pump will stop for a different reason. In this case one of the underlying reasons was the complexity of the plant. It had been designed to recover as much heat as possible and this resulted in complex interactions, difficult to foresee, between different sections. Whatever the reason for the pump stopping, the consequences of the interruption of flow were of major importance.

Equipment is, of course, designed to withstand the temperature (and other conditions) at which it normally operates. Today, it is often designed to withstand the temperatures that it can reach under abnormal or fault conditions. This was less common in 1969 when the plant was built. It was more common then to rely on control and trip systems and operator intervention to prevent equipment reaching temperatures that could cause failure, either immediately or in the long term.

3.3.5.2 Refinery furnace failure

In May 2013 a major failure occurred during the start-up of a primary reformer in an oil refinery in Southern Africa [22]. Although no one was killed the incident caused major environmental and equipment damage and resulted in the plant being shutdown for more than 6months. It occurred when furnace tubes became overheated because burners were started using fuel gas with a higher calorific value than normal and with an insufficient flow of process nitrogen through the tubes due to restricted availability. The inexperienced operator did not appreciate the risks of starting the furnace under these conditions.

The investigation highlighted that "the plant, as originally designed, could not be described as inherently safe" [22]. One particular issue that added to the complexity of plant operation and meant operators required a good understanding of its operation and associated risks was that there was no direct measurement of tube skin temperatures provided, even though hazards of tube failure are well known. Indirect indications of temperature had to be used instead. Fundamentally, there was an almost full reliance on operators following start-up procedures to avoid incidents, but the controls required to ensure effectiveness were not in place.

3.3.6 Elimination

Elimination involves changing a process design or removing a hazardous activity. The effect is to eliminate the hazardous event completely. Examples include removing a storage tank from a design or avoiding the need for pigging a pipeline [8].

Elimination did not appear in Kletz’s list because he generally saw it as a result of applying inherent safety rather than a principle in itself. However, he did make specific reference to elimination when discussing his principles of inherent safety as an option for limitation of effects.

3.3.6.1 Buncefield incident

On 11 December 2005 an explosion occurred at the Buncefield oil products terminal in the United Kingdom. It was one of the most significant explosions in Europe since the Flixborough disaster.

The explosion occurred because 195 tonnes of petrol (gasoline) leaked from a storage tank when it was overfilled following a transfer from another site. A huge 500m by 350m vapour cloud was formed in the zero wind conditions [23]. A tanker driver at the loading gantry reported the cloud, which initiated the site emergency system. The site’s fire pump was started, providing a source of ignition. The subsequent vapour cloud explosion caused an overpressure of 2000mbar [23]. Although there were no deaths or life changing injuries, this incident resulted in £1 billion of physical damage.

One of the causes of the Buncefield incident was that high-level alarms failed to operate. Clearly, an inherently safer design would have reduced the risks without relying on such devices. In this case it would not be practical to stop storing petrol (at least until the internal combustion engine is phased out) but there is scope to eliminate vapour cloud explosions from storage tank overflowing from the roof of storage tanks. The UK Health & Safety laboratory has spent the years since the incident reviewing how to do this [24].

The Buncefield explosion was so large because the overflow from the roof of the tank acted like a ‘waterfall’, atomising into small droplets which provided more surface area to accelerate the evaporation of the liquid gasoline into vapour. An option being considered to eliminate this is to instal overflow or downpipes near the top of the storage tank. These would mean that liquid from an overfilled tank would be directed to a safe collection area where it can be safely managed and removed. This eliminates the waterfall effect and hence the potential for a significant vapour cloud explosion.

An overflow or downpipe would be both permanent and inseparable from the tank design. This means it would be more reliable than installing additional layers of protection such as additional level switches and valves, which are all prone to failure. Although this still results in a small vapour cloud from the splashing as the gasoline exits the downpipe, the risk that is eliminated is the potential for a significant vapour cloud explosion impacting adjacent populations, and so is inherently much safer.

Downpipes have started to be installed more widely, both on new storage tanks, and also retrofitted to existing storage tanks at different locations in the United Kingdom and around the world. However, it has not been recognised universally across the industry and there is still quite a lot of effort going into installation of safety instrumented devices (e.g. high level instruments which close feed valves) instead.

There was a view shortly after Buncefield that it was a one-off event and so may not warrant too much attention. This was not the case and 5years later a similar explosion occurred at the Caribbean Petroleum Corporation storage tank facility in Puerto Rico when a tank overflowed during offloading of gasoline from a tanker ship. This caused destruction of 17 storage tanks on the site and damage to buildings over a mile away [25]. Also another similar explosion occurred in Jaipur, India in the same year and further research has shown that incidents had occurred before Buncefield including at Newark, United States in 1983.

3.3.7 Segregation

The aim here is to limit the effects of a hazard by providing physical separation between the source of hazards and receptors such as people or the environment [8].

Although segregation did not appear in Kletz’s list of inherently safe principles it is clearly related to his second concept of "People who are not there can’t be killed."

One of the first options to be considered on any project is where it will be located. This highlights why segregation is a valid principle of inherent safety. For example during a project we can minimise the equipment inventory of a toxic compound, simplify the process, or moderate the reaction conditions to reduce the potential for an exothermic reaction. However, increasing the distance between the source and potential impacted receptors should also be considered and is often the best way to minimise risks.

Segregation can also be applied to newer industries like hydrogen fuelling stations for hydrogen powered vehicles. The UK HSE undertook an experimental demonstration that shows how liquid hydrogen releases from a 1in. hole can create an explosion and a jet fire. Locating hydrogen fuel pumps on retail sites away from populations, buildings, and other equipment based on the distances in this UK HSE study [26] would be an inherently safer design.

3.3.7.1 Tianjin explosion

On 12 August 2015 a series of explosions occurred at the Tianjin factory in the Hebei province of China. One hundred and seventy-three people were killed, including many firefighters. Hundreds of others were injured and hundreds of homes were destroyed [27].

It is believed that that the accident was triggered initially by a fire. Attempts were made to extinguish this fire but 40min later an explosion occurred, followed shortly after by a much larger explosion. This chain of events occurred because hazardous materials were being stored in close proximity to people and the consequences would have been much less if effective segregation had been applied.

### 3.4 Applying inherent safety through a system’s lifecycle

The concept and principles of Inherent Safety can be applied at all stages of a system’s lifecycle. However, the greatest opportunities for risk reduction are usually found at the earlier stages of development because there are more options to eliminate or significantly reduce hazards by changing the fundamental design or location. Also, making these changes earlier is likely to be cheaper and cause fewer knock-on issues.

3.4.1 Inherent safety in projects

As Kletz said [18],

Text Box 3.27

If we are to develop inherently safer designs, we need to carry out studies similar to hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) much earlier in design, at the conceptual stage when we are deciding which process to use, and at the flowsheet stage, before detailed design starts. These studies should be additional to the usual HAZOP of the line diagram and will not replace it.

Whilst inherent safety can be applied at all stages in a project, the options change as it develops.

3.4.1.1 Inherent safety at the conceptual stage

Kletz acknowledged that what he viewed as the conceptual stage of a project may be defined differently by others. He clarified by saying that this is the stage when decisions are made about what to make, by what route, and where the facility will be located [10]. At the time he started talking about this the idea of considering inherent safety so early in a system’s lifecycle was new. It is good to know that since then formal studies at the conceptual stage have become much more common (although still overlooked in many places).

Kletz and Amyotte explained the benefit of such an early start [2].

Text Box 3.28

The words identify, prevent, control, and mitigate, applied to hazards, are often used to describe the stages to be followed to obtain a safe plant. Inherently safer design could be described as part of prevention, but it is better to add avoid or eliminate to the list of key words, to emphasise its importance. Designers seem to respond to the word control by thinking of added protective equipment; the word does not trigger thoughts of avoidance.

Applying the concept of inherently safer design at the very beginning of a project, we may be able to choose a safe product instead of a hazardous one. When a process is being chosen, we may be able to choose a route that avoids the use of hazardous raw materials or intermediates.

Oncethechemistryhasbeendecidedandwearedevelopingtheflowsheet,wemaybeabletochooseor develop intensified equipment such as reactors, distillation columns, and heat exchangers that do not require large quantities of materials. It may be possible to manage without intermediate storage,possibly by siting production and consuming plants near each other, and to avoid flammable heat-transfer fluids or refrigerants.

3.4.1.2 Inherent safety at the start of design

Kletz described early design as the ‘flowsheet stage’. Today it may be called Front End Engineering Design (FEED) or Define; but one of the outputs is likely to be a flowsheet that identifies the main subsystems and how they are connected.

Kletz and Amyotte provided a comprehensive list of issues to consider before finalising the flowsheet, with the suggestion that these could be included in an early design HAZOP or equivalent study. The issues to consider for a process plant at the early stage of design include [2]:

• Materials—develop an inventory, identify their hazards, and consider options to remove or reduce;

Reaction—size of reactors and opportunities to reduce; process conditions and opportunities to make less severe; and any potential for runaway reaction;

• Separation—inventory of material in separators and opportunities to reduce;

• Heat transfer—inventory of material in exchangers and opportunities to reduce; use of less hazardous heat transfer medium; ensuring the most hazardous material is in the safest part of the exchanger (e.g. in tubes not shell);

• Storage—factors defining storage requirements and options that would reduce these; storage process conditions and options to make less hazardous;

• Equipment types—options to use simpler alternatives;

• Human error—options to reduce susceptibility that do not involve additional safety systems.

The same questions can be asked throughout the design but it becomes increasingly difficult as the project develops. For example, location options may be very limited very early on, especially if it has taken years to negotiate purchase of new land. Hence, inherent safety should be part of the land selection process.

3.4.1.3 Inherent safety during detailed design

Although it may become more difficult it is still important to continue looking for options to increase inherent safety as the design is developed. Examples include eliminating or minimising the stored inventory of hazardous materials, substituting a more corrosion resistant material of construction for equipment, minimising potential hazardous impact by locating access routes and roads away from potentially hazardous areas, locating emergency equipment such as fire water pumps and switch gear for emergency equipment away from the main plant which it is designed to protect, and designing the equipment arrangement in well vented and open process areas to prevent accumulation of hydrocarbon if released.

Even towards the end of detailed design there will still be decisions made that can contribute. KletzprovidedalistofdetailstoconsiderduringtheHAZOPorothersafetystudiesincluding[10]:

• Types of gasket;

• Valve design;

• Locations where positive isolation will be required and the methods to be used (e.g.

spades, blinds, removable spools);

• Hoses and other flexible connections;

• Sample points;

• Use of quick release couplings;

• Fragile items (e.g. glass, plastic).

As well as selecting items based on safety, the full lifecycle costs and potential complexity should be considered. For example, standardising gaskets, nuts, and bolts can reduce requirements for stock.

3.4.1.4 Inherent safety during construction

Although the design is likely to be fixed, there are still opportunities to apply inherent safety when planning for the construction stage of a project. Examples include minimising the hazards of simultaneous operation and construction activities by installing modular units constructed offsite rather than on site construction, and eliminating the potential impact of a

blast wave on portable occupied buildings associated with construction by relocating away from potentially impacted areas. Also, elimination of heavy lifts over live equipment, and location of muster points for construction workers in safer areas.

3.4.2 Inherent safety during operation

Whilst applying inherent safety at the start of a system’s lifecycle provides the greatest opportunities to reduce risk it does not mean that it is only relevant to projects. There can be many opportunities to apply inherent safety during the operational stage of the lifecycle of a system.

Whilst identifying opportunities for inherent safety should be a continual goal, there will be specific times when it should be considered formally. For example, inherent safety should be an option when identifying actions following an incident investigation or when evaluating a plant or process change, instead of simply specifying additional safety systems or changes to procedures. Also, it should be a key part of any routine review of safety studies and of any study carried out retrospectively. In fact, inherent safety was a part of changes to Risk Management Plans (RMP) introduced in 2017 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [28], which apply to petroleum, coal products manufacturing, chemical and paper manufacturing where Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation is required every 5years.

Applying inherent safety to an operating system is not straight forward and care has to be taken to avoid unintended consequences. These can include loss of operational flexibility, reduced plant availability, or transfer of safety risks. It is a fine balance to select reasonably practicable options whilst not affecting economic viability.

3.4.2.1 Managing inventories

Just because a tank or vessel can hold a quantity of material, it does not always need to be filled to capacity. Reducing inventories to only what is needed will reduce the potential consequences of failure. On the other hand, reduced inventories will inevitably mean that materials need to be handled more often (e.g. smaller deliveries carried out more often). The risk of additional handling needs to be considered against the reduction of risk through reduced inventory.

3.4.2.2 Inherent safety during maintenance

It is standard practice to isolate, drain, clean, and purge process equipment before maintenance. But decisions can be made about how much plant needs to be prepared in this way. The inherently safer approach is to shut down and prepare the whole facility because this will minimise the inventory of material present whilst the maintenance is being carried out and also reduces the potential consequence of maintenance errors (e.g. someone breaking the wrong pipework joint). However, it can have significant impact on production. Also, preparing plant and equipment for maintenance, and returning it to service after maintenance carries its own risk and so a balanced approach has to be taken.

Another decision to make when carrying out maintenance is the type of isolation to be used. The inherently safer option is to use positive isolation, with removal of spool pieces being the most robust option because the alternative methods (e.g. spades, blind flanges) are easier to defeat. However, all forms of positive isolation involve breaking joints and so introduce their own risks.

3.4.2.3 Inherent safety during hazardous operations Whilst hazard is present there is always some risk. But certain operations such as plant start-up and shutdown are known to be more hazardous. In these cases the concept of "People who are not there can’t be killed" can be applied by clearing sites during the most hazardous operations, or at least limiting them to essential personnel only. Other hazardous operations where this applies include tanker deliveries of hazardous material, opening pig receivers/launchers, sampling, and any activity involving a break of containment, such as filter changing.

3.4.2.4 Inherent safety of obsolete equipment

There can be a tendency to allow obsolete equipment to remain on site. This can be because of the expense of removal or ‘just in case’ it may be used again in the future. This introduces the potential for hazardous materials to collect or hazardous conditions to develop over time. These can either result in incidents in their own right or contribute to the escalation of other incidents.

Ideally, any equipment not being used would be removed. Where this is not possible or desirable it should be fully cleaned and purged, and ‘air gaps’ created so that there is no connection between the obsolete items and the operating plant.

3.4.3 Applying inherent safety in practice

Inherent safety is often considered to be a philosophy: a way of thinking. However, for it to work in practice, inherent safety has to be applied as a systematic process.

Applying inherent safety to complex systems is particularly challenging but it is here that the greatest benefits can be achieved. It is not something that can be done alone, so knowing who to involve is one of the main considerations. In most cases input from different discipline engineers will be required because they all have different expertise and different areas of responsibility.

Collaboration leads to better decision making when applying inherent safety. But like all safety studies a clear process is required to ensure the approach taken is rigorous and systematic. Three different approaches are described as follows [29].

3.4.3.1 Focus on high severity hazards The greatest benefits from applying inherent safety are from eliminating or reducing potential events with high severity (major accidents). The challenge here can be that these events occur very infrequently, making it difficult for people to fully appreciate the benefits when they are having to deal with the frequently occurring lower consequence events.

Potential high severity events will usually be identified in a hazard identification study such as HAZID or a Quantified Risk Assessment (QRA). The requirement to formally apply inherent safety should be identified from this study leading to a separate follow-up review.

The output from the hazard identification study (HAZID or QRA) becomes the input to inherent safety review, but if action is taken that results in an inherently safer solution it may be possible to update the results of the original hazard identification study to show the improvements achieved.

Examples showing where a focus on high severity events can lead to inherently safer solutions include:

• Increasing the design pressure of low pressure equipment to remove any high-low pressure interfaces. Capital costs are increased but the possibility of overpressuring systems is removed;

• Minimising quantities stored of hazardous materials or moving their location away from human populations;

• Moderating temperatures so that the materials being handled are below their flash-point or auto-ignition so that fire does not occur in the event of a loss of primary containment; and

• Removing intermediate storage by using existing capacity in other vessels like the bottom of a distillation tower or reflux drum.

3.4.3.2 Applying inherent safety during option selection

During the lifetime of a project (including modifications of operating systems) many different options may be studied. Inherent safety should be a key part of selecting the preferred option. One way to do this is to define inherent safety goals and include these in the evaluation process. Conducting a formal and structured Inherent Safety Workshop is recommended, with the focus on changing the basic demand so that add-on safety measures will not be relied on so much [30]. An advantage of doing this is that the project team will improve its understanding of inherent safety principles, which will be of benefit in later stages of the project [30].

A clear definition of inherent safety goals can be used to rank options using a scoring method, which is used to assist decision making [29, 31]. This is best done by a team so the decision-making benefits from the experience and expertise of different discipline engineers.

Inherent safety goals should be selected to be relevant to a project. They may include minimising impact on populations, including third parties offsite, and minimising incidents during construction.

An example of option selection common to most projects is location. The first goal is to select an option away from existing populations. But another consideration is whether populations can be moved, for example by relocating a building or moving the workplace of people currently based there. This can involve a trade-off between everyday convenience and safety, which may not always be obvious to everyone because of the low probability of high severity events.

If a scoring system is used for an evaluation the scores would normally be applied according to how well an option aligns with an inherent safety goal. The range could be between ‘fully aligned’ and ‘no alignment’, with a scale to represent partial alignment. The scores may be weighted if the inherent safety goals are not deemed to be equal. Although the selection of the scoring system and the implementation of the process is not scientifically rigorous, the main value of this process is in the way it brings teams together in understanding and identifying hazards and the ways to manage these hazards, so assisting the decision-making process, and in doing so, selecting an inherently safer option.

Examples of option selection include conceptual designs or selection of a technology. The latter may be dependent on the licensor for a process, which can be challenging because the licensor is understandably reluctant to share details of their offering due to commercial confidentiality. Despite this, it still may be possible to get some idea of how well inherent safety goals are being achieved by looking for indications that suggest a reliance on add-on safety systems, for example, the number of relief valves installed, the maximum relief load for flare sizing, or safety instrumented systems with a high safety integrity level. These all indicate that there has been little consideration given to inherent safety in the design.

3.4.3.3 Checklists during general engineering design reviews

One issue can be that people do not have the opportunity to formally consider inherent safety on a regular basis. A checklist approach can prompt them to consider the options and prevent items being forgotten [32]. This checklist can be applied as a team to bring in different discipline expertise and experience. However, when using a checklist, it is usually appropriate to remind the team of the inherent safety principles which underpin the checklist, and in this way, build capability and understanding within the team of ISD.

The following is an example of a checklist that can be adopted for this purpose (Table 3.2).

TABLE 3.2

Set construction and start-up philosophy to avoid construction activities during start-up of adjacent equipment

3.4.3.4 A cultural issue Applying inherent safety concepts requires hazards to be identified and for people to consider the wider issues. This can be particularly challenging when resources are focused on operational activities and when process safety incidents, particularly major accidents, are so rare as to not be considered.

Integrating inherent safety into decision making is largely a cultural issue. Having a sense of ‘chronic unease’—continuously looking for potential issues and aiming to uncover root causes rather than simply fixing the immediate issue—results in people recognising that absence of incidents does not mean that there is no hazard and so inherent safety can always be applied.

Kletz shared the following examples where hard working and diligent people often overlook the opportunities to develop inherently safer solutions because they are too focussed on dealing with the systems or consequences of events instead taking a step back to understand what is happening and how an inherently safer solution could be applied [33].

Text Box 3.29

(a) A cylinder lining on a high-pressure compressor was changed 27 times in 9years. On 11 occasions it was found to be cracked and on the other 16 occasions it showed signs of wear. No one asked why it had to be changed so often. Everyone just went on changing it. Finally, a bit of the lining got caught between the piston and the cylinder head and split the cylinder.

(b) While a man was unbolting some 3/4in. bolts, one of them sheared. The sudden jerk caused a back strain and absence from work. During the investigation of the accident, seven bolts that had been similarly sheared on previous occasions were found nearby. It was clear that the bolts sheared frequently. If, instead of simply replacing them and carrying on, the worker had reported the failures, then a more suitable bolt material could have been found.

Why did they not report the failures? If they had reported them, would anything have been done? The accident would not have occurred if the foreman or the engineer, on their plants, had noticed the broken bolts and asked why there were so many.

(c) A line frequently choked, As a result of attempts to clear the chokes, the line was hammered almost flat in several places. It would have been better to have replaced the line with a larger one or with a line that had a greater fall, more gentle bends, or rodding points.

Taking the second incident (b) discussed previously as an example, the inherently safer decision would be to replace the bolts with stronger ones. The challenge is that changing all the bolts may have created more work in the short term and so may not have been considered as viable. However, it would have led to a reduction in both work and safety risks over the longer term. One way to integrate inherent safety into day-to-day operations and prevent incidents before they happen is to start asking your front line staff what is making their work difficult. This requires a more searching attitude to finding out about how things work in practice rather than how it may be imagined or described in procedures. But it also requires buy in from front line staff, which requires trust and a demonstrated willingness to respond to make things better.

### 3.5 How far should we go?

Kletz was well aware that inherently safer options can be expensive and cannot always be justified. But he was very keen to emphasise that any decisions made should be based on all the facts and not simplified short-sighted criteria [9].

Text Box 3.30

First, we have to decide on the level of safety we require. This may he expressed as a Fatal Accident Rate, as the risk to a member of the public living near the factory, as a hazard rate, or in some other way that is considered appropriate.

The two ways of achieving the objective must then be costed—an inherently safer plant (or process) and a conventional or extrinsically safe one with ‘added-on’ safety. We must remember that we shall probably want to add on more protective equipment than on the last plant, that in some countries the authorities may insist on more protective equipment than we think is necessary, that yet more may be needed during the life of the plant and that all this added-on safety requires testing and maintenance.

We should then adopt the cheaper solution, even if it is the extrinsically safer one. If the two costs are about the same, then we should prefer the inherently safer solution as the ‘intangibles’ are in its favour. It will be easier to convince the authorities and the public that the plant will not blow up.

The shortcoming of this procedure is that the conventional design may be cheaper because no research has been done on alternatives. It is therefore necessary at corporate level to take a definite decision to carry out research on inherently safer plant. Whether or not we adopt the results of the research should depend on the relative costs of the new and conventional plants, as already discussed.

Once somebody develops an economic inherently safer design, then it will become harder for others to build new extrinsically safer plants for the same product. They can no longer say that they are following ‘best current practice’ or that the alternatives are not ‘reasonably practicable’. Those who are giving no thought to inherent safety had better beware they may be left behind in the race.

3.5.1 Controlling risks in practice

Although the goal of inherent safety is to avoid reliance on added safety systems, it is recognised that it can never be fully effective. This means safety systems are often required, and in deciding which to implement it is important to recognise that they are not all equally effective or reliable.

3.5.1.1 Is inherent safety a risk control?

There can be some confusion because inherent safety aims to avoid a hazard and if avoided it does not need to be controlled. On this basis it is possible to argue that inherent safety is a separate entity. However, pragmatically it is clear that managing risks is achieved in practice in multiple ways and making clear-cut distinctions is neither necessary or helpful.

3.5.1.2 Hierarchy of risk controls

The concept of the hierarchy of risk control illustrates that the effectiveness of controls depends on their characteristics. As a general philosophy controls at the top of the hierarchy should always be considered first because they are most reliable. But the overall solution is likely to involve controls at all levels of the hierarchy.

The following is generally considered as an appropriate hierarchy of risk control [8]:

1. Inherent safety—the most effective;

2. Passive controls (e.g. surface coatings, atmospheric vent);

3. Active controls (e.g. relief valve, safety instrumented system);

4. Procedural controls (e.g. start-up procedure, permit to work, response to alarms—least effective).

In addition, mitigation may be considered as an additional control to address residual risks, in order to reduce the consequences of failure of other controls. This includes items such as catchment bunds or dikes, personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures.

It is noted that the US EPA make it clear in their RMP regulations that the term ‘hierarchy of control’ should not be used and instead state that controls should always be used in the specified order [28]. Interestingly this aligns exactly with the earlier definition of hierarchy of controls, so we have an alignment of the principle even if the EPA does not explicitly use of the term ‘hierarchy of controls’.

3.5.1.3 Defence in depth Kletz used the concept of ‘defence in depth’ to explain the role of inherent safety in the wider safety context. He said [10].

Text Box 3.31

The prevention of accidents is based on defence in depth. If one line of defence fails, there are others in reserve.

These lines of defence are similar in concept to James Reason’s Swiss Cheese model [34] in that each line, or layer of protection, prevents events occurring. However, none are fully reliable and failures are represented as holes in the pieces of cheese. When these holes line up a failure pathway is created and results in an accident.

Kletz and Amyotte pointed out that lines of defence act at first to prevent an event, then mitigate to reduce the hazard of an event and finally act to protect people. They listed them as follows for a flammable hazard [2]:

1. Avoidance of hazard (inherent safety);

2. Containment;

3. Detection and warning;

4. Isolation;

5. Dispersion;

6. Removal, as far as possible, of known sources of ignition;

7. Protection of people and equipment against the effects of fire and explosion;

8. Provision of firefighting facilities.

They went on to say [10].

Text Box 3.32

Similarly, in industry, a common failing is to ignore the outer lines of defence because the inner ones are considered impregnable. When they fail, there is nothing to fall back on. Some companies have not worried about leaks of flammable gas because they had, they believed, removed all sources of ignition so that leaks could not ignite. When an unsuspected source of ignition turned up, an explosion occurred. More often, companies have not worried about large inventories of hazardous materials because they knew, they thought, how to prevent leaks and deal with any that occurred. When they were proved wrong, a fire or explosion occurred or people were killed by toxic gas or vapour.

Effective loss prevention is based on strong outer defences, i.e. on getting rid of our hazards when we can rather than controlling them by added equipment that may fail or may be neglected. It is hubris to imagine we can infallibly prevent a thermodynamically favoured event.

3.5.2 ALARP

The Acronym ALARP is now widely used and stands for "As Low As Reasonably Practicable." In a safety context it is used when discussing whether a risk is ALARP or further action is required to reduce it.

3.5.2.1 Kletz’s view of ALARP Kletz may not have used the term ALARP but he did describe ‘reasonably practicable’ being relevant because it is impractical to remove every hazard [33]. He implied that the size of a risk and whether it can be tolerated should be compared to the cost, time, and trouble of removing or reducing it.

Kletz recognised that applying an inherently safer solution is not always reasonably practicable and so acknowledged that the principles of ALARP are important when determining how risks are going to be managed.

3.5.2.2 ALARP in legislation

The UK Health and Safety regulatory system [35] is ‘goal-setting’ rather than prescriptive ‘rule-setting’. This means it is the duty holder’s responsibility to demonstrate that they are managing their risks rather than the regulator’s responsibility for saying how risks shall be managed. This approach has ALARP at its heart, relying on a judgement of what is considered ‘reasonably practicable’.

Other countries including the United States have avoided adoption of the ALARP principle [28]. One of the reasons is that it is difficult to define what is considered as reasonably practicable for a given circumstance, which makes it difficult to implement when a regulatory approach is rule-based rather than goal-setting. However, recent clarification by the US EPA to the proposed 2017 RMP regulation for petroleum, coal, chemical, and paper manufacturing uses the concept of ‘practicability’ when applying inherent safety [28]. This recognises that the implementation of the most inherently safer option may not be practicable especially when applying to existing plant. Considerations for this practicability are listed as including timeframe to implement taking into account economic, environmental, legal, social, and technological factors. In this way, there is no absolute requirement to instal the inherently safer solutions, as these should be considered alongside passive, active, or procedural controls as ways to reduce risk.

However, it should be noted that as this book goes to print, the EPA’s Proposed Reconsideration Rule rescinded some of the earlier requirements including those associated with ISD [36].

3.5.2.3 Applying ALARP in practice

Due to the origin of ALARP in UK legislation, the UK’s HSE provides the most guidance on how to apply ALARP in practice. This tends to rely quite heavily on cost–benefit analysis. Whilst this may play a part, it does introduce complexity and relies on quantified data related to risk, which is rarely available in any useful form.

Ironically, HSE has provided some excellent guidance on applying ALARP, but has buried it in some rather obscure references. In particular, deep in their guidance for permissioning within the Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) regulations it states that "ALARP demonstration for individual risks is essentially a simple concept which can be satisfied by the Operator answering the following fundamental questions" [37].

Question 1—What more can I do to reduce the risks? Question 2—Why have I not done it?

Answers to the first question are qualitative in nature and involve looking systematically at the risks and drawing up, in a proportionate way, a list of measures which could be implemented to reduce those risks.

The answer to the second question may be qualitative or quantitative in nature depending on the predicted level of risk prior to the implementation of those identified further measures. The guidance states that if "it cannot be shown that the cost of the measure is grossly disproportionate to the benefit to be gained, then the Operator is duty bound to implement that measure" [37]. However, there are often reasons to not implement additional measures that are not purely due to financial cost. Risk transferral is very often a factor where a measure to reduce one risk increases another.

In some cases ALARP can mean that an inherently safer solution is not safer overall. For example, choosing to not make a product, to eliminate a hazard, may simply mean that production is moved to another site, possibly in another country. The alternative may apply lower safety standards. Also, risks of transport will have increased. In this case the issue may be moral rather than economic, and there may be an argument to say that such global issues are not necessarily the responsibility of commercial organisations. However, with increased scrutiny from customers of the supply chains of their suppliers it is possible that keeping production local may be the best solution from all perspectives.

ALARP can highlight why inherent safety is preferred to applying add-on safety devices. For example, High Integrity Pressure Protection Systems (HIPPS) are often installed where specification changes occur on a plant so that some plant is rated below the maximum pressure that can be achieved. These are often complex devices that employ multiple instruments acting on multiple valves using a voting system. Testing them can be particularly difficult and time consuming. If this is taken into account the inherently safer option of using fully rated pipework and plant may prove to be cheaper over the full lifetime.

Applying ALARP can challenge views on what is considered to be the inherently safer solution. For example, interlock systems are often specified for pig launchers/receivers that require multiple valve operations to prepare them for opening to insert or remove the pigs. The interlocks are considered necessary to prevent human errors when operating valves. However, they add complexity, which is against inherent safety principles. The reality is that all interlocks can fail or be overridden. The complexity introduced by the interlock makes it difficult for people to understand what they are doing, or more importantly, why. Interlocks should not be considered as an inherently safer solution and require thorough assessment to ensure that they do actually achieve an overall risk reduction.

3.5.3 Friendly systems

Inherent safety can appear to be a very technical process reliant on detailed engineering solutions. But Kletz pointed out that thinking about how people are going to interact with a system during its lifecycle can result in subtle design details that can reduce risks during construction, installation, operation, and maintenance. He described this approach as "Making plants friendlier" [10]. He gave some very practical advice and examples, which are summarised as follows.

3.5.3.1 Avoiding knock-on effects "Friendly plants are designed so that incidents do not produce knock-on or domino effects" [10]. This can be achieved by:

• Providing corridors, about 50m wide, between units;

• Designing and locating equipment so that if their most likely failures occur the consequences are limited. For example, storage tanks are usually built with a weak weld where the roof meets the walls, so that, if a tank is over pressurised this weld will fail first and, although the tank is damaged, the liquid inside will remain contained; and • Constructing plants that handle flammable materials outside of buildings.

3.5.3.2 Making incorrect assembly impossible

"Friendly plants are designed so that incorrect assembly is difficult or impossible" [10]. For example:

• Compressor valves designed so that inlet and outlet cannot be interchanged;

• Relief valves with different sized flanges on their inlet and outlet so that they cannot be installed the wrong way round.

Kletz and Amyotte cautioned that "human beings have demonstrated an ability to defeat even the most inherent of safety features" [2]. Use of unique hose connections is often proposed as a design that eliminates the potential for people to connect to the wrong vessel. A common example is a site that receives deliveries of acid and caustic liquids from road tankers, which can react violently if mixed. However, tanker drivers often have to deal with many different types of connection and so routinely carry adaptors, which rather defeats the effectiveness of this approach.

3.5.3.3 Making status clear

"With friendlier equipment, it is possible to see at a glance whether it has been assembled or installed incorrectly or whether it is in the open or shut position" [10]. Other examples include:

• Check (nonreturn) valves clearly marked with their direction of flow;

• Gate valves with rising spindles are friendlier because it is easy to determine if they are open or closed;

• Including spectacle blinds in the original design is friendlier because it is easy to see its status whereas if standard blinds or spades are used it may not be immediately clear if one has been inserted or not; and

• Translucent tanks allow level to be seen directly rather than relying on instrumentation (although their use is limited by the materials available).

3.5.3.4 Tolerance of misuse "Friendly equipment will tolerate poor installation or operation without failure" [10]. Examples include:

• Spiral wound gaskets leak at a lower rate than fibre if the joint works loose;

• Expansion loops are more tolerant to poor installation than bellows;

• Articulated arms are friendlier than hoses; and

• Pumps that are tolerant to running dry.

3.5.3.5 Ease of control

"If a process is difficult to control, we should look for ways of changing the process before we invest in complex control equipment" [10]. It should have the following features:

Be based on use of physical principles rather than relying on added control equipment;

• Be robust so that it will still operate even though there are approximations in the model of the process on which the control system is based;

• Be resilient so that it can be tested and maintained without interfering with operations;

• Respond gradually to process changes rather than rapidly;

• Have wide safe operating limits;

• Have wide margins between control limits and safe operating limits;

• Not rely on very accurate control; and

• Avoid positive feedback within the process, for example avoiding exothermic reactions that increase their rate when they get hot as this can result in a runaway.

It has been noted that computer control introduces a number of additional issues and work is required to make it as friendly as possible. This includes making it easier to scrutinise and subjecting it to safety studies (e.g. CHAZOP).

3.5.3.6 Instructions and other procedures "We should aim for safety by design rather than procedures when it is practicable and economic to do so" [2]. Procedures will always be required but they are often too long and complex. One reason for this is a desire to cover every conceivable eventuality; sometimes due to the writer wishing to protect themselves from criticism instead of focusing on the users’ needs. It is better to write an instruction that covers most of the circumstances that can arise and is short and simple enough to read, understand and follow [2].

3.5.3.7 Lifecycle friendliness

"We should, when designing a plant, consider the problems of those who have to construct and demolish it, as well as those who have to operate it" [2]. Kletz gave examples of having to lift a reactor over existing plant that had to be shutdown, which could have been avoided by changing the design. Also, the issues experienced in the nuclear industry where decommissioning is proving to be difficult because it was not considered during the original design.

The following summarises the role of inherent safety in minimising risks over the full lifecycle of a system [38].

Inherently safer technologies implemented in the design phase do not create environmental problems, and inherently cleaner technologies do not create safety problems. Instead of resorting to end-of-pipe solutions, inherently safer and cleaner approaches during design and other phases of a plant’s life cycle can eliminate potential conflict between environmental initiatives and safety activities.

3.5.4 Global issues

The accident at Bhopal has provided us with one of the most graphic examples of why inherent safety is so important. Unfortunately, project design teams are still missing opportunities to design out hazards and continue to rely only on add-on safety devices to reduce risks [30].

The fundamental issues that resulted in the Bhopal plant being built in India remain and there is a continued trend to moving bulk chemicals production and handling to developing countries [39]. Even when the same safety standards are applied to these plants as in other parts of the world the hazards are often greater because plants are larger, and legislation is often less effective at ensuring safety standards are maintained for the lifecycle.

A design exported from developed to developing countries is often justified ‘because it works’, with minimal consideration of safety issues. "Perversely, it seems that widespread adoption of inherently safer design, the best available technique for reducing risk to people and the environment, has been prevented by inherent aversion to commercial risk and conservatism of the chemical industry" [39]. This can be exacerbated by project evaluations being focussed on economic and logistical considerations at the expense of any serious engineering or safety evaluation.

The message for industry is that it should "Export inherent safety not risk" [39].
