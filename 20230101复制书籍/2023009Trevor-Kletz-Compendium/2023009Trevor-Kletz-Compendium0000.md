## Introduction

### 1 Trevor Kletz

One of the founders and leaders of process safety in thought and practice, Professor Trevor Kletz died on 31 October 2013. He left behind a magnificent canon of publications, including 16 books and well over a 100 reviewed papers on loss prevention and process safety, which communicate useful learning in a readable and understandable way and which will serve long into the future to guide safety people in their work in our industry and beyond. They have provided the philosophical and practical basis for many areas of process safety and encouraged people to look at safety differently.

Kletz wrote with clarity and understood the power of story as a way to get important mes- sages across. The aim of this compendium is to update and combine Kletz's writings with new stories and commentary showing how they remain relevant today and how the underlying ideas have been developed further. It is a resource for a new generation of engineers and others, which is intended to inspire them to make a positive contribution to the way safety is managed where they work. It should also prompt people who have read his books in the past to have another look.

Trevor Asher Kletz was born in 1922 in Darlington of Jewish parents, from a Russian immigrant background. His father, a shopkeeper, was insistent that Trevor should better him- self and he attended The King's School, Chester and then Liverpool University. When he was 11 years old, an uncle had given him a chemistry set as a present, which influenced his deci- sion to study chemistry. He graduated in 1944 and joined Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), where he spent 8years in research, 16 in production management, and the last 14 as safety adviser to the Petrochemicals Division. In 1978 he was appointed an industrial professor in the Chemical Engineering Department at Loughborough University. On retiring from ICI in 1982 he joined the Department full-time; in 1986 he became a visiting fellow and was latterly a visiting professor at Loughborough and an adjunct professor at Texas A&M University in the United States.

David Edwards became aware of Trevor when he joined the Loughborough Chemical Engineering Department in 1990. He recalls: "I did not know much about how academic careers progressed but one of the few things they told me was to get a line of research. Safety seemed the most prominent of the lines available (mainly due to Frank Lees), so I aligned myself with that. Then I attended one of Trevor's lectures on inherently safer design, which blew me away isn't all plant designed like this (it's just common sense)- well, actually, no. One thing that particularly struck me was Trevor's graph showing that safety improves with money expended. We spent the next few years working, with considerable guidance from Trevor, to show that inherently safer plants are also cost effective."

Trevor was appointed an OBE in 1997 and he was a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institution of Chemical Engineers, the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. He was also an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the Safety and Reliability Society. He was one of the most famous chemical engineers, who was not a chemical engineer!

Trevor retired at the age of 90, as his old school noted: "One of King's oldest Old Boys Trevor Kletz has finally retired what a career! Every engineer/technician in the UK and far beyond on any chemical plant will have heard of Trevor, who has much improved the safety of the chemical process industry with his career work. He certainly deserves his place in the School's Hall of Fame, and all the accolades he has been awarded in his long career - Happy retirement Trevor!"

Up until then he was still making forthright and insightful statements about safety in the process industry, saying in 2011 that the industry's 'macho culture' was one of the main causes of recent accidents.

Jill Wilday, who knew him at ICI, commented: "When I joined ICI in the late 70s he was the Safety Advisor for Petrochemicals Division and his safety newsletter was circulated throughout ICI and was as popular as New Scientist among young engineers. (This was well before email as a means of sharing information). The newsletter predominantly described incidents and their recommendations, but always with an opportunity for you to work out what went wrong before reading as far as the conclusions of the internal enquiry. It was easy and entertaining to read and consequently it was popular, well read, and so it acted to improve everyone's understanding. He also used humour and those bits in particular were much repeated in conversations in the canteen.'

Andy Rushton was a colleague of Trevor and David Edwards in the Chemical Engineering Department at Loughborough University, where they worked together on inherent safety.

Andy says: "He was a great communicator (always top of the poll on the [student feedback] 'happy' sheets)and his forte was distilling his (and others') experience, drawing out principles and presenting them in a relevant way (not just to process engineers-transport, defence and other sectors have been mightily influenced too). He could make what he was saying relevant to you and your problems, and could present it with humour, patience and cogency (although not everyone agreed with everything he said)."

His entertaining after-dinner stories further served to make people remember him and his messages.

Not only was he a masterful communicator, both written and orally, but he also had the insight to reduce seemingly complicated issues to the simple fundamentals and to understand which were important. He knew that he could save lives by spreading his insights and he had the perseverance, patience, and generosity to repeat his messages until heard and understood.

So what were his messages? Well, if you don't know, you should definitely read this compendium! We also recommend that you read his books, which are listed here.

If you only read one of these, choose "Process Plants: A Handbook for Inherently Safer Design" [1] now in its second edition and co-authored by Professor Paul Amyotte of Dalhousie University. The inherently safer approach aims to eliminate or reduce hazards or exposure to them or the chance of occurrence by design. Most people will say that it is common sense, and it is, but it took Trevor to cast this common sense into a practical philosophy. There are undoubtedly tens, probably hundreds, possibly thousands of people who each day go home to their families and will do for many years to come, but who are only with us because of decisions influenced by this light that Trevor shone to lead our way.

Craig Skinner, also a chemical engineering graduate of Loughborough University, remarks: "It wasn't until I was a practicing chemical engineer that Kletz's inherent safety really started to make sense to me, and the simple and practical framework of inherent safety principles has helped in many key engineering decisions over the last 30 years, both when applied to major hazards and when deciding between engineering options. Over this period, inherent safety has also grown from a philosophy into a practical, effective process and team activity, and this is shared in this book alongside Kletz's original concepts and stories, which we hope readers find pragmatic and helpful."

Inherent Safety is not the only area where his clear thinking has changed the way we think and act. His writings on human error and accident investigation refocused the emphasis away from individual lapses to systems failures and safer design. These concepts fostered a revolution in modern safety management thinking. In a video that he made for the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, Trevor says: "For a long time, people were saying that most accidents were due to human error and this is true in a sense but it's not very helpful. It's a bit like saying that falls are due to gravity." Andy Brazier comments: "The discovery of Kletz's book 'An Engineer's view of human error' [2] was a defining moment for me because it gave a clear insight into the issues affecting industry and illustrated why understanding human factors is so important.'

A theme that runs through Trevor's work is drawing lessons from accidents and his mantra: "organisations have no memory" should be a constant watchword. Another favourite among his many sayings is: "There's an old saying that if you think safety is expensive, try an accident.

Accidents cost a lot of money. And, not only in damage to plant and in claims for injury, but also in the loss of the company's reputation."

Trevor also said: "You may not agree with some (or even all) of the advice in my books but I hope you won't disregard the accident reports. If you don't like my advice, I hope you will decide what to do instead." [3].

Trevor was a firm believer that people should be persuaded by sound reason to take the safer course. His was a common sense approach and if we put all of his ideas together we get a common sense philosophy.

1. Inherent Safety: eliminate the hazard or cause of the accident.

2. If you can't do this, use techniques such as HAZOP and HAZAN to analyse what you want to do, applying rigorous technical methods but also with an awareness of Human Error, in order to minimise the risk.

3. If despite all of this, you do have an accident: investigate it, record, and make the details easily accessible, learn the lessons and tell people all about it, so that we don't do it again.

Outside of his professional life and vocation, Trevor was very active in the Jewish community and had a strong interest in steam trains. He also lived in a bungalow. This is inherently safer, because the hazards due to stairs, which are the biggest cause of accidents in the home, have been eliminated. He always wore belt and braces, so that there were two layers of protection against his trousers falling down; he probably had a piece of string in his pocket just in case!

Trevor is buried in the Jewish section of the Linthorpe Road Cemetery in Middlesbrough, surrounded by trees and birdsong.

The late Professor Sam Mannan, who was Director of the Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center at Texas A&M University, summed up his life and work well: "Some have characterized Trevor as a scholar, some have called him an astute practitioner, and some hold him in high regard for his unique ability to transform complex issues into simple messages that he communicated in his unique way. Above all, Trevor was a visionary and a trailblazer, the likes of whom come in our midst only every few centuries."

Managing process safety is proving to be a long-term challenge for industry. Unfortunately major accidents are still occurring and lessons from the past are not being learnt as well as they should. Trevor was one of the first people to tackle these issues and his stories and proposals for improving safety remain entirely relevant today. This compendium collects, updates, and enhances these messages for a new audience.

David Edwards said "It is a great honour for me to contribute to this new compendium of Trevor's work. He was a great man, whom I had the privilege of working with and calling my friend and mentor. It behoves us all to honour his memory by following his teaching and example in our professional and personal lives by learning from past incidents and making all of our endeavours inherently safer."

过程安全（process safety）理论与实践的先驱之一 Trevor Kletz 教授于 2013 年 10 月 31 日辞世。他留下了一笔宝贵的学术遗产，包括 16 本著作和超过 100 篇经过同行评审的学术论文，涵盖了损失预防和过程安全等领域。这些作品以通俗易懂的方式传播了重要的安全知识，将长期指导我们行业乃至其他领域的安全工作者。Kletz 教授的著作为过程安全的诸多领域奠定了理论和实践基础，同时也鼓励人们用创新的视角看待安全问题。

Kletz 教授以其清晰的写作风格著称，他深谙故事叙述的魔力，善于用生动的案例传递重要信息。本书旨在整合并更新 Kletz 教授的著作，结合新的案例和评论，展示这些经典思想在当今时代的持续影响力，以及它们如何得到进一步发展和应用。这本书是为新一代工程师和其他相关人士准备的宝贵资源，希望能激励他们在各自的工作岗位上为安全管理做出积极贡献。同时，我们也希望这本书能够唤起那些曾经读过 Kletz 教授作品的人重新翻阅，重温这些经典思想。

Trevor Asher Kletz 出生于 1922 年，在英国达灵顿市。他的父母是犹太人，有着俄罗斯移民的背景。Trevor 的父亲是一名小店主，但他坚持认为儿子应该有更好的发展。在父亲的鼓励下，Trevor 先后就读于切斯特的国王学校（The King's School，Chester）和利物浦大学。

Trevor 对化学的兴趣源于 11 岁时一份特殊的礼物。他的叔叔送给他一套儿童化学实验套装，这个礼物激发了他对化学的热爱，并最终影响了他的学业选择。1944 年，Trevor 大学毕业后加入了帝国化学工业公司（Imperial Chemical Industries，ICI）。在 ICI，他的职业生涯跨越了不同的领域：先是在研究部门工作了 8 年，随后在生产管理岗位上又度过了 16 年，最后的 14 年则担任石油化工部门的安全顾问。

1978 年，Trevor 的职业生涯迎来了新的篇章。他被任命为拉夫堡大学化学工程系的工业教授。1982 年从 ICI 退休后，他并没有选择安享晚年，而是全职加入了拉夫堡大学。到了 1986 年，他的学术生涯更上一层楼，成为该校的访问研究员，后来还晋升为客座教授。不仅如此，他还将自己的知识和经验带到了大洋彼岸，在美国德克萨斯 A&M 大学担任兼职教授，为国际化学工程教育做出了贡献。

David Edwards 在 1990 年加入拉夫堡大学（Loughborough University）化学工程系时首次了解到 Trevor。他回忆道：「当时我对学术生涯的发展路径知之甚少，但我得到的为数不多的建议之一是要确立一个研究方向。安全领域似乎是最突出的选择之一（主要是由于 Frank Lees 教授的影响），所以我决定专注于这个方向。后来，我参加了 Trevor 关于本质安全设计（inherently safer design）的一次讲座，这次经历令我大开眼界。我不禁想到：难道不是所有工厂都应该采用这种设计吗？毕竟这只是常识。然而，事实并非如此。特别让我印象深刻的是 Trevor 展示的一张图表，它显示了安全性会随着资金投入的增加而提高。在接下来的几年里，在 Trevor 的悉心指导下，我们致力于证明本质安全的工厂不仅更安全，还具有成本效益。」

Trevor 于 1997 年被授予大英帝国官佐勋章（OBE）。他是英国皇家工程院院士、英国化学工程师学会会员、英国皇家化学学会会员和美国化学工程师学会会员。此外，他还是职业安全与健康研究所和安全与可靠性学会的荣誉会员。有趣的是，尽管 Trevor 被认为是最著名的化学工程师之一，但他本人的教育背景实际上并非化学工程！这一事实凸显了他在跨学科研究和应用方面的卓越贡献。

Trevor Kletz 在 90 岁高龄时光荣退休，他的母校 King's School（国王学校）这样评价道：「我校最年长的校友之一 Trevor Kletz 终于退休了，他的职业生涯何其辉煌！在英国乃至全球，任何化工厂的工程师或技术人员都听说过 Trevor 的大名。他毕生致力于提升化工行业的安全性，成就斐然。Trevor 当之无愧地跻身我校名人堂，他在漫长职业生涯中获得的所有荣誉都实至名归。Trevor，祝你退休生活愉快！」

即便到了退休之际，Trevor 仍在就过程工业的安全问题发表犀利而富有洞察力的见解。2011 年，他曾指出该行业根深蒂固的「大男子主义文化」（一种强调冒险、蔑视安全的风气）是近期事故频发的主要原因之一。

曾在帝国化学工业公司（Imperial Chemical Industries，ICI）与 Trevor 共事的 Jill Wilday 回忆道：「我在 70 年代末加入 ICI 时，Trevor 担任石油化工部门的安全顾问。他编写的安全简报在整个 ICI 内部广为流传，在年轻工程师中的受欢迎程度堪比《新科学家》（New Scientist）杂志。（要知道，那时电子邮件还未成为主流的信息共享工具）。这份安全简报主要内容是描述各类事故及其相关建议，但总是巧妙地设计，让读者有机会在看到内部调查结论之前，自己先推断事故原因。简报行文生动有趣，因此广受欢迎，阅读量很高，有效提升了每个人对安全问题的认识。Trevor 还善于运用幽默，这些妙趣横生的段落经常成为员工在食堂聊天时的谈资。」

Andy Rushton 是 Trevor 和 David Edwards 在拉夫堡大学化学工程系的同事，他们共同致力于研究本质安全（inherent safety）领域。

Andy 这样评价道：「他是一位出色的沟通者（在学生评教反馈中总是获得最高评分）。他的强项是能够提炼自己和他人的经验，提取核心原则，并以贴近实际的方式呈现出来。他的影响力不仅限于过程工程领域，在交通、国防等其他行业也产生了巨大影响。他能够使自己的观点与听众的实际问题紧密相关，并以幽默、耐心和富有说服力的方式表达出来（尽管并非所有人都赞同他的每一个观点）。」

他在餐后常常讲述一些有趣的轶事，这进一步加深了人们对他本人及其观点的印象。

他不仅是一位出色的演说家和作家，还具有敏锐的洞察力，能够将看似复杂的问题简化为基本原理，并准确把握其中的关键点。他深知通过传播自己的见解可以挽救生命，因此他以坚持不懈的毅力、耐心和慷慨精神，不断重复自己的观点，直到这些观点被人们听到并理解。

那么，他究竟传达了哪些观点呢？如果你还不了解，那么这本汇编绝对值得一读！我们也推荐你阅读他的著作，以下是他的作品列表：

如果你只能阅读其中一本书，我推荐你选择《工艺装置：本质安全设计手册》（Process Plants：A Handbook for Inherently Safer Design）[1]。这本书目前已经出版了第二版，由达尔豪斯大学的 Paul Amyotte 教授与 Trevor Kletz 共同撰写。本质安全方法（Inherently Safer Approach）是一种创新的安全理念，它致力于通过设计来消除或减少危险、降低危险暴露程度或减少危险发生的可能性。

很多人可能会说，这不就是常识吗？确实如此。但正是 Trevor Kletz 将这种看似简单的常识转化为了一种实用的安全哲学。这种理念的影响是深远的：每天都有数十人、数百人，甚至可能数千人能够平安回家与家人团聚，而这种幸福将持续多年。他们之所以能够安然无恙，很大程度上要归功于 Trevor 提出的这种安全理念所影响的决策。Trevor 就像是在工业安全领域点燃了一盏明灯，为我们指引着前进的方向。

同样毕业于拉夫堡大学化学工程专业的 Craig Skinner 这样说道：「说实话，直到我真正成为一名化学工程师后，我才开始理解 Kletz 提出的本质安全性（inherent safety）概念的重要性。在过去 30 年里，这套简单实用的本质安全性原则框架，在我面对许多关键工程决策时都帮了大忙。无论是处理重大安全隐患，还是在不同工程方案中做选择，这些原则都发挥了重要作用。更令人兴奋的是，在这段时间里，本质安全性已经从一种理念发展成为一套实用有效的流程和团队协作方法。在这本书里，我们不仅分享了 Kletz 最初提出的概念和案例，还介绍了这些新的发展。我们希望读者们能觉得这些内容既实用又有帮助。」

Trevor Kletz 的清晰思维不仅在本质安全性（Inherent Safety）领域改变了我们的思考和行动方式。他关于人为错误（human error）和事故调查（accident investigation）的著作，将重点从个人失误转移到系统失效和更安全的设计上。这些概念引发了现代安全管理思维的革命性变革。在为美国化学安全委员会（U.S. Chemical Safety Board）制作的一个视频中，Trevor 这样说道：「长期以来，人们一直认为大多数事故都是由人为错误造成的。从某种意义上说这是对的，但这种说法并不十分有建设性。这就像说跌倒是由重力造成的一样。」Andy Brazier 评论道：「发现 Kletz 的著作《工程师眼中的人为错误》[2] 对我来说是一个转折点，因为它清晰地揭示了影响行业的问题，并阐明了为什么理解人为因素如此重要。」

Trevor 工作中的一个重要主题是从事故中汲取教训。他的口头禅「组织没有记忆」应该成为一个永恒的警示。这句话提醒我们，如果不持续关注安全问题，组织很容易忘记过去的教训。他的另一句名言是：「有句老话说，如果你觉得安全成本高，那就试试事故的代价吧。事故不仅会造成工厂损失和伤害赔偿，还会严重损害公司的声誉，这些都需要付出巨大的代价。」

Trevor 还说过：「你可能不同意我书中的部分甚至全部建议，但我希望你不要忽视那些事故报告。如果你不认同我的建议，我希望你能够思考出其他更好的解决方案。」[3]

Trevor 坚信，应该用合理的论据来说服人们采取更安全的做法。他的理念是一种基于常识的方法，如果我们把他所有的想法汇总起来，就形成了一种基于常识的安全哲学。

这种哲学包含以下几个要点：

1、本质安全（Inherent Safety）：消除危险源或事故的根本原因。

2、如果无法做到第一点，就使用像 HAZOP（危险和可操作性分析）和 HAZAN（危险分析）这样的技术来分析你的计划。在应用严格的技术方法的同时，也要考虑到人为失误的可能性，从而将风险降到最低。

3、如果尽管采取了上述措施，事故仍然发生了：那就要调查事故，记录详细情况，并确保这些信息易于获取。要从中吸取教训，并广泛传播这些经验，以避免同样的错误再次发生。

在工作和职业使命之外，Trevor 在犹太社区非常活跃，并对蒸汽火车有着浓厚的兴趣。有趣的是，他选择住在平房里。这其实也体现了他的安全理念，因为平房消除了楼梯带来的危险，而楼梯恰恰是家庭事故的最大祸首。Trevor 总是习惯同时系皮带和背带，为裤子提供双重保护；据说他口袋里可能还会备着一根绳子，以防万无一失！

如今，Trevor 长眠于米德尔斯堡林索普路公墓的犹太人区，四周树木环绕，鸟语花香，宁静祥和。

已故的 Sam Mannan 教授曾是德克萨斯 A&M 大学 Mary Kay O'Connor 过程安全中心（Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center）的主任。他曾经这样精辟地总结了 Trevor Kletz 的一生和工作：「有人称 Trevor 为学者，有人说他是一位老练的实践者，还有人高度赞赏他能将复杂问题转化为简单信息，并以其独特方式传达的能力。但最重要的是，Trevor 是一位具有远见卓识的开拓者，这样的人物几个世纪才会出现一次。」

管理过程安全（process safety），即确保工业生产过程中的安全，一直是行业面临的长期挑战。遗憾的是，重大事故仍在发生，而过去的教训并没有得到应有的吸取。Trevor Kletz 是最早着手解决这些问题的先驱者之一，他的案例分析和改善安全的建议至今仍然具有重要意义。这本新编的文集收集并更新了 Trevor 的重要著作，同时强化了这些宝贵信息，以期能够影响新一代的读者。

David Edwards 表示：「能为这本 Trevor 作品新文集贡献一份力量，我感到无比荣幸。Trevor 是一位伟大的人，我有幸与他共事，并将他视为朋友和导师。为了纪念他，我们应该在专业和个人生活中遵循他的教导和榜样，从过去的事故中吸取教训，努力使我们所有的工作本质上更加安全。」
