## 0101. Hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis

### 1.1 Introduction

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is considered to be one of the key methods when managing process safety. Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) is the most well-known, widely used, and effective PHA method.

Kletz stated in his autobiography [1] that there was an "obvious need to find out what can go wrong without waiting until it has gone wrong. HAZOP is the preferred technique in the process industries."

Kletz has sometimes been credited with developing the concept of HAZOP, but that is not true. HAZOP grew out of ‘critical examination', a technique which was popular with ICIa during the 1960s for examining management decisions. Ken Gee, a production manager with ICI, decided to apply this technique to the design of a new phenol plant and, over a 4-month period, spent 3 days a week, every week, examining every aspect of the plant, discovering many potential hazards and operating problems that would not have been foreseen otherwise. Kletz said this was the first recognizable HAZOP [1].

Kletz used the following quote to illustrate the role of HAZOP for predicting potential problems [2]:

Text Box 1.1

Samuel Coleridge described history as a ‘lantern on the stern', illuminating the hazards the ship has passed through rather than those that lie ahead. It is better to illuminate the hazards we have passed through than not illuminate them at all as we may pass the same way again, but we should try to see them before we meet them. HAZOP can be a lantern on the bow.

a) ICI was a large British chemicals company, which is now defunct, but parts of it are now incorporated into other companies and many of the old sites are still occupied by process plants.

Although Kletz did not develop the method, he had a significant role in its adoption across the process industry. He encouraged public courses to be held at UK universities, with the first at Teesside Polytechnic (now a University) in 1975 and followed by UMIST in 1978. Kletz's motivation was the knowledge that HAZOP led to safer process plants and operations, but it is a sign of his communication skills that he not only persuaded universities to run courses but he was also successful at obtaining agreement from his employer, ICI, to make the method widely available to others, including competitors.

HAZOP has become the method of choice for identifying hazards and operability issues in process plant design. In most HAZOPs more operability problems are identified than hazards. Like all methods it has its limitations. However, HAZOP is used widely beyond the process industry, where the approaches taken are adapted to suit the particular requirements.

1.1 引言过程危害分析（Process Hazard Analysis，PHA）被认为是管理过程安全的关键方法之一。其中，危害和操作性研究（Hazard and Operability Study，HAZOP）是最著名、应用最广泛和最有效的 PHA 方法。

Kletz 在他的自传 [1] 中指出："我们显然需要在事故发生之前就找出可能出错的地方。在过程工业中，HAZOP 是实现这一目标的首选技术。"

虽然有时人们会将 HAZOP 的概念归功于 Kletz，但事实并非如此。HAZOP 其实源于「批判性检查」，这是 20 世纪 60 年代英国帝国化学工业公司（ICI）常用的一种管理决策审查技术。ICI 的一位生产经理 Ken Gee 决定将这种技术应用于新建苯酚工厂的设计中。在 4 个月的时间里，他每周花 3 天时间仔细检查工厂的各个方面，由此发现了许多原本难以预见的潜在危害和操作问题。Kletz 称这次尝试是第一个可辨识的 HAZOP [1]。

Kletz 引用了以下名言来阐述 HAZOP 在预测潜在问题方面的作用 [2]：

Samuel Coleridge 曾将历史比喻为「船尾的灯笼」，它只能照亮船只已经驶过的危险区域，而不是前方将要面对的危险。虽然回顾过往的危险总比完全忽视要好，因为我们可能会重蹈覆辙，但更理想的做法是在遇到危险之前就能预见它们。在这个意义上，HAZOP 就像是船头的灯笼，为我们照亮前方的航程。

a）ICI（Imperial Chemical Industries，英国帝国化学工业公司）曾是英国一家大型化工企业。虽然该公司已经不复存在，但其部分业务已被其他公司收购，而且许多原有的工厂场地仍在继续运营，用于各种化工生产过程。

尽管 Kletz 并非危害与可操作性研究（HAZOP）方法的发明者，但他在推动整个加工行业采用这一方法方面发挥了重要作用。他积极倡导在英国各大学举办公开课程，首次课程于 1975 年在 Teesside Polytechnic（现已升格为大学）举办，随后在 1978 年，曼彻斯特理工学院（UMIST）也开设了相关课程。Kletz 之所以如此热心推广 HAZOP，是因为他深知这一方法能够显著提高加工厂的安全性和操作可靠性。值得一提的是，Kletz 不仅成功说服了各大学开设 HAZOP 课程，还说服了他的雇主 ICI 同意将这一方法广泛分享给其他公司，甚至包括竞争对手。这充分展现了他卓越的沟通能力。

如今，HAZOP 已成为识别加工厂设计中潜在危害和操作问题的首选方法。有趣的是，在大多数 HAZOP 研究中，发现的操作问题往往比安全隐患更多。当然，像任何方法一样，HAZOP 也有其局限性。尽管如此，HAZOP 的应用范围已经远远超出了加工行业，在其他领域的应用中，研究方法会根据具体需求进行相应的调整。

1.1.1 What is HAZOP?

Kletz described HAZOP as follows:

Text Box 1.2

HAZOP is a technique which provides opportunities for people to let their imaginations go free and think of all possible ways in which hazards or operating problems might arise, but—to reduce the chance that something is missed—it is done in a systematic way, and each pipeline and each sort of hazard is considered in turn. The study is carried out by a team so that the members can stimulate each other and build upon each other's ideas.

A more formal definition is provided by Eggett and Whitty:

HAZOP is a formal, qualitative, systematic and rigorous examination of a plant, process or operation, in order to identify credible deviations from the design intent in the context of the complete system, which can contribute to the realisation of hazards or operability problems, by applying the experience, judgement and imagination, stimulated by key words, of a team.

The core principle of HAZOP is that problems only arise when there is a deviation from either normal operation or a system's design intent.

1.1.1 什么是 HAZOP？

Kletz 对 HAZOP 的描述如下：

专栏 1.2

危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）是一种特殊的技术。它鼓励人们发挥想象力，尽可能地思考可能出现的危险或操作问题。为了降低遗漏重要信息的风险，这项技术采用系统化的方法，逐一考虑每个管道和每种潜在危险。HAZOP 分析通常由一个团队共同完成，团队成员之间可以相互启发，在彼此的想法基础上不断创新。

Eggett 和 Whitty 对 HAZOP 提供了一个更为正式的定义：

HAZOP 是一种正式的、定性的、系统化且严格的检查方法，用于分析工厂、流程或操作。它的目的是在整个系统的背景下，识别那些可能偏离原始设计意图的情况（即可信偏差），这些偏差可能导致危险或操作问题。分析过程中，团队成员会运用他们的经验、判断力和想象力，并在关键词的引导下展开讨论。

HAZOP 的核心理念是：问题只会在偏离正常操作或系统设计意图时才会出现。

1.1.1.1 HAZOP basics

HAZOP is a qualitative process involving a structured and systematic examination of a system. The first activity is to break the system into ‘nodes', each of which has a clear identity but is not too large to assess. For process plant the current approach is to identify nodes by section or by major equipment item. The main working document for a HAZOP is the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID).

The objectives of HAZOP are to identify all the deviations that can have a consequence and decide whether action is required to control the hazard or operability issue. This is performed by the assessment team in a meeting or workshop, which is recorded by a scribe.

Documenting the HAZOP provides an effective means of capturing inputs and outputs and communicating potential hazards and operability problems to the people who operate, maintain, and manage the facility.

1.1.1.1 HAZOP 基础知识

HAZOP 是一个定性的过程，涉及对系统进行结构化和系统化的检查。首要任务是将系统划分为若干个「节点」（node），每个节点都有明确的特征，但规模不至于大到难以评估。对于工艺装置而言，当前的做法是按照部分或主要设备来划分节点。HAZOP 分析的主要工作文件是管道和仪表图（Piping and Instrumentation Diagram，P&ID）。

危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Analysis）的目标是识别所有可能产生后果的偏差，并决定是否需要采取行动来控制潜在的危险或操作问题。这个过程通常由评估团队在会议或研讨会中执行，并由专门的文档记录员详细记录。

记录 HAZOP 的过程不仅能有效捕捉分析的输入和输出，还能向设施的操作、维护和管理人员清晰传达潜在的危险和操作问题。

1.1.1.2 A simple example

A simple node consisting of a tank and associated pumps and valves is shown in Fig. 1.1 as a very simple example. The design intent is stated as follows: 'Pump P1 supplies petrol to a storage tank, which is vented to a safe location. P2 delivers petrol from the tank'.

During the HAZOP the node is examined and the scribe records the output of the team's deliberations and conclusions. This information is recorded as shown in Table 1.1.

This is only a very simple example. A full HAZOP would consider many other deviations and the plant would have other nodes.

1.1.1.3 Parameters and guidewords

A HAZOP is conducted by considering a range of parameters applicable to the type of system and a range of guidewords applicable to the parameter. The aim is to assist the HAZOP team to consider all possible deviations. This helps them to avoid becoming fixated on the more obvious or known issues, which may mean others that may be less obvious but potentially significant are overlooked.

In the process industry the typical parameters include flow, pressure, and temperature, and the guidewords include none, more, less, and different. They have been developed to cover the main scenarios that are known to result in major accidents and significant operational problems. The aim is to combine parameters and guidewords to obtain meaningful deviations, for example no flow, more pressure, less temperature.

**FIG. 1.1** Example node for a simple HAZOP.

| # | Deviation | Cause      | Consequences             | Safeguards          | Actions                          |
|----|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | More flow | None identified |                   |             |                              |
| 2 | No flow  | Pump P1 stopped | Tank not filled           | None             |                              |
| 3 |      | Valve V1 shut  | Tank not filled           | None             | Install a pump temperature trip              |
|  |      |         | P1 damaged, possible fire or explosion| None             |                              |
| 4 | High level| Delay stopping P1| Tank overflows. Possible explosion  | Level gauge monitored by Operator | Install a high level alarm and high-high level trip that stops P1 |

Guidewords vary depending on the industry, but are usually defined in sector guidance. There is a school of thought that says the lists are prescriptive and should not be changed or added to. Kletz did not agree [2].

Text Box 1.3

They are based on long experience but, nevertheless, if you find other words are useful, by all means use them, particularly if you are applying HAZOP outside the type of activity for which it was originally designed.

1.1.1.2 一个简单的例子

图 1：展示了一个简单的系统节点，包括一个储罐及其相关的泵和阀门。这个设计的目的如下：泵 P1 向储罐供应汽油，储罐通过管道排气至安全位置。泵 P2 则负责从储罐中输送汽油。

在 HAZOP 分析过程中，团队会仔细检查这个节点，文档记录员会详细记录团队的讨论过程和得出的结论。表 1 展示了这些记录的格式和内容。

需要注意的是，这只是一个非常简化的例子。在实际的 HAZOP 分析中，我们会考虑更多的可能偏差，且整个工厂通常包含多个需要分析的节点。

**图 1.1** 简单危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）的示例节点。

| 序号 | 异常情况 | 原因 | 后果 | 现有安全措施 | 建议采取的行动 |
|----|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | 流量过大 | 未发现 |          |       |               |
| 2 | 无流量 | 泵（P1）停止运转 | 储存罐无法充满 | 无 |               |
| 3 |   | 阀门（V1）关闭 | 储存罐无法充满 | 无 | 安装泵温度自动断电保护装置 |
| |   |     | 泵（P1）损坏，可能引发火灾或爆炸 | 无 |               |
| 4 | 液位过高 | 延迟关闭泵（P1）| 储存罐溢出。可能引发爆炸 | 操作员通过液位计监控 | 安装高液位警报和极高液位自动断泵装置 |

1.1.1.3 参数和指导词

HAZOP 分析通过考虑一系列适用于特定系统类型的参数，以及与这些参数相关的指导词来进行。这种方法旨在帮助 HAZOP 团队全面考虑所有可能的偏差。它能有效防止团队仅聚焦于明显或已知的问题，从而忽视了那些可能不太明显但同样重要的潜在问题。

在工业生产过程中，我们通常关注的参数包括流量、压力和温度。为了分析可能出现的问题，我们使用一些关键词，如「无」、「过多」、「过少」和「异常」。这些参数和关键词的组合已经被开发出来，用于覆盖已知可能导致重大事故和严重操作问题的主要情况。我们的目标是将这些参数和关键词结合起来，得出有意义的异常情况，比如没有流量、压力过高、温度过低等。

引导词（Guidewords）在不同行业中有所不同，但通常在行业指南中有明确定义。有一种观点认为这些引导词列表是固定的，不应该被修改或增添。然而，著名化工安全专家特雷弗·克莱茨（Trevor Kletz）并不赞同这种观点 [2]。

> 引导词虽然是基于长期经验总结而来，但如果你发现其他词语更有用，请随意使用，尤其是当你将危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）应用于其原本设计用途之外的领域时。

1.1.1.4 HAZOP method

Whilst flexible use of guidewords may be acceptable, only studies that follow the defined method should be considered as a HAZOP. The procedure for each node is as follows:

1. Define the node and its design intent;

2. Work through all combinations of parameter and guideword for the node to identify possible deviations (situations where the node would deviate from its design intent);

3. Identify the potential causes of all meaningful deviations identified;

4. Identify potential consequences of each deviation and cause;

5. Identify existing safeguards in place to control the risks of the cause and consequence;

6. Consider the adequacy of safeguards and possible opportunities to reduce risk; and

7. Record the results for future reference.

HAZOP is performed in a meeting or workshop controlled by a team leader. Nodes are selected and displayed to the team so that they know what is being discussed. In the process industry this is usually achieved by marking the nodes on the Piping and Instrument Diagram (P&ID) using coloured marker pens and laying them out on a table, pinning them to the wall, or issuing duplicate copies so that every member of the team can see them. This can also be done electronically so that the marked up drawing can be displayed using a projector (but hand marking is often found to be easier).

The team leader identifies and summarises the node and encourages the team to consider all possible deviations. A scribe is usually appointed to take detailed notes but he/she is also a contributing member of the team.

The details for the HAZOP method may vary in different industries but the basic method should be the same. For an up-to-date description of the HAZOP method for the process industry, refer to the ‘HAZOP Guide to Best Practice' published by the Institution of Chemical Engineers [5].

1.1.1.4 HAZOP 方法

尽管灵活使用引导词是可以接受的，但只有严格遵循规定方法的研究才能被视为真正的 HAZOP 分析。对于每个研究节点（通常指系统中的特定位置或过程），HAZOP 分析按以下步骤进行：

1. 明确定义节点及其设计目的；

2. 分析该节点的所有参数和引导词组合，以识别可能的偏差（即节点偏离其设计目的的情况)；

3. 找出所有有意义偏差的潜在原因；

4. 确定每种偏差和原因可能带来的后果；

5. 识别现有的安全措施，这些措施用于控制由原因引发的风险和可能的后果；

6. 评估现有安全措施的充分性，并探索进一步降低风险的可能性；

7. 详细记录分析结果，以供将来参考和审查。

通过这种系统化的方法，HAZOP 分析能够全面识别和评估工业过程中的潜在危害，从而提高系统的安全性和可靠性。

危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）是在团队领导主持的会议或研讨会中进行的。分析过程中，团队会选择并展示特定的分析点（也称为节点），确保所有成员都了解正在讨论的内容。在过程工业中，这通常通过在管道和仪表图（P&ID，一种显示工艺流程细节的工程图）上用彩色记号笔标记这些分析点来实现。标记后的图纸可以铺在桌子上、贴在墙上，或者分发副本给每个团队成员。虽然也可以用电子方式展示标记过的图纸（如使用投影仪），但实践中发现手动标记往往更为便捷。

团队领导负责识别并总结每个分析点，同时鼓励团队考虑所有可能出现的异常情况或偏离正常工况的情形。团队通常会指定一名成员担任记录员，负责详细记录讨论内容，但这名记录员同时也是团队的积极参与者。

虽然 HAZOP 方法在不同行业可能有细节上的差异，但其基本方法应该是一致的。如果想了解过程工业中 HAZOP 方法的最新描述，可以参考化学工程师学会出版的《HAZOP 最佳实践指南》[5]。

1.1.1.5 Recording the output from HAZOP

The value of a HAZOP is somewhat limited if its results are not recorded in a useful and accessible way. In the time before personal computers, handwritten notes would have been taken and a final record would be made by typing a report. Whilst this remains an option it is now far more common for a scribe to make records using a computer. Generic spreadsheet or word processing software can be used but proprietary software is available that provides templates and handles follow-up reporting and monitoring.

Whether proprietary or generic software is used the output is captured in a table with columns to record deviations, causes, consequences, safeguards, and follow-up actions. This may not be considered as a particularly fascinating read but having a full record of what was discussed and the basis for evaluations and decisions can be essential in the future to confirm a design is appropriate and demonstrate that risks are As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). Failure to follow the correct HAZOP method or record the results in full will inevitably cause problems in the future.

Text Box 1.4

Some of the factors to be considered when choosing a programme for recording the results of HAZOPs:

- Is it simple to use? How much training is required?

- Is it well proven?

- What are the initial and ongoing costs?

- What is the availability and cost of support?

- Are updates available?

- Is it compatible with other programmes?

- What other studies are included?

- Can it be customised? (e.g. can additional columns be added to indicate items which have to be reported to internal or external authorities?)

- Does it include a comprehensive list of prompts?

- How does it monitor actions and changes?

- How are data on failure rates included?

- Can it be linked to accident databases?

- Does it have a spell-check facility?

1.1.1.5 HAZOP 分析结果的记录

如果危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）的结果没有以实用且易于访问的方式记录下来，其价值就会大打折扣。在个人电脑普及之前，人们通常采用手写笔记的方式，最后再打印成报告。虽然这种方法至今仍可使用，但现在更常见的做法是由专门的记录员使用计算机进行记录。记录可以使用常见的电子表格或文字处理软件，也可以选择专门设计的软件，后者提供模板并能处理后续的报告和监控工作。

无论使用哪种软件，输出结果都会被整理成一张表格，其中包含偏差、原因、后果、保障措施和后续行动等栏目。虽然这样的记录可能看起来并不吸引人，但拥有完整的讨论记录以及评估和决策的依据，对于未来验证设计的适当性和证明风险已降低到合理可行的最低水平（As Low as Reasonably Practicable，ALARP）至关重要。如果没有严格遵循正确的 HAZOP 方法或未能完整记录结果，将不可避免地在日后引发问题。

专栏 1.4

选择记录 HAZOP 结果的软件时，需要考虑以下因素：

- 是否容易上手？需要多少培训？

- 是否经过充分验证？

- 初始和长期使用成本如何？

- 技术支持的可用性和费用如何？

- 是否提供软件更新？

- 是否与其他软件兼容？

- 还包含哪些其他相关的分析工具？

- 该系统是否可以定制？（例如，能否添加额外的列来标示需要向内部或外部机构报告的项目？）

- 它是否包含一个全面的引导性问题列表？

- 它如何追踪和记录行动及变更？

- 如何在系统中包含故障率相关数据？

- 它能否与事故数据库进行连接？

- 它是否具备拼写检查功能？

1.1.2 When is HAZOP carried out?

Although very effective and having wide application, HAZOP is not the only safety study available and it is not always the right method to use. Like many things, it is a case of using the right tool to do the right job at the right time.

1.1.2 HAZOP 的实施时机

尽管 HAZOP（危害与可操作性分析）非常有效且应用广泛，但它并非唯一可用的安全研究方法，也并不总是最合适的选择。正如许多情况一样，关键在于在正确的时间使用正确的工具完成正确的任务。

1.1.2.1 Original role of HAZOP on new projects

Kletz was very clear about the timing of a HAZOP.

Text Box 1.5

A HAZOP cannot be carried out before the line diagrams, complete with control instrumentation (that is, process and instrumentation diagrams) are complete. It should be carried out as soon as possible thereafter, before detailed design starts. The ‘window of opportunity' is thus limited, so plan the meetings well in advance. It is no use waiting until the line diagrams are ready and then expecting the members of the team to be available.

If an existing plant is being studied the first step is to bring the line diagrams up to date or check that they are up to date. Carrying out a HAZOP on an incorrect line diagram is the most useless occupation in the world. It is as effective as setting out on a journey with a railway timetable 10 years out of date.

The timing of HAZOP was formalised by ICI (the company where HAZOP originated) with this six stage process:

1. Exploratory phase—identification of basic hazards and review of sites, check for availability of data;

2. Flowsheet phase—coarse HAZOP using Process Flow Diagrams (PFD), identification and assessment of significant hazards;

3. Detailed design—HAZOP on ‘frozen' P&IDs;

4. Construction—check that decisions made in earlier studies have been implemented, including hardware and software;

5. Commissioning—precommissioning check and final inspection; and

6. Postcommissioning—safety audit and review after a few months of operation.

The general expectation was that a full HAZOP was performed once. Kletz highlighted the challenges of including HAZOP in a project plan [2].

Text Box 1.6

The HAZOP on a large project may take several months, even with two or three teams working in parallel on different sections of the plant. It is thus necessary to either:

(a) Hold up detailed design and construction until the HAZOP is complete; or.

(b) Allow detailed design and construction to go ahead and risk having to modify the detailed design or even alter the plant when the results of the HAZOP are known.

Ideally, the design should be planned to allow time for (a) but if completion is urgent (b) may have to be accepted.

1.1.2.1 HAZOP 在新项目中的原始作用

Kletz 对 HAZOP 的实施时机有非常明确的观点。

文本框 1.5

在完成管线图（包括控制仪表，即过程和仪表图（P&ID)）之前，无法进行 HAZOP。应在图纸完成后尽快进行分析，且要在详细设计开始之前完成。因此，可供实施的「时间窗口」是有限的，所以要提前计划好相关会议。等到管线图准备就绪后再期望团队成员能够立即参与是不现实的。

对于正在研究的现有工厂，首要任务是更新或核实工艺流程图的准确性。基于错误流程图进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）是毫无意义的，就像使用 10 年前的火车时刻表开始旅程一样徒劳无功。

HAZOP 的时间安排由帝国化学工业公司（ICI，HAZOP 的发源地）正式制定，包括以下六个阶段：

1. 探索阶段：识别基本危险，审查场地，检查数据可用性；

2. 流程图阶段：利用工艺流程图（Process Flow Diagrams，PFD）进行初步 HAZOP，识别和评估重大危险；

3. 详细设计阶段：对最终确定的管道和仪表图（Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams，P&ID）进行 HAZOP；

4. 建设阶段：检查先前研究中做出的决策是否已落实，包括硬件和软件；

5. 调试阶段：进行预调试检查和最终检验；

6. 调试后阶段：运行几个月后进行安全审计和复查。

一般来说，完整的 HAZOP 分析通常只进行一次。Kletz 在文献 [2] 中强调了将 HAZOP 纳入项目计划的挑战。

专栏 1.6

大型项目的 HAZOP 可能需要几个月时间，即便有两到三个团队同时在工厂的不同部分并行工作。因此，必须选择以下方案之一：

(a）暂停详细设计和施工，直到 HAZOP 完成；或者

(b）允许详细设计和施工继续进行，但冒着在得知危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）结果后可能需要修改详细设计甚至改动工厂的风险。

理想情况下，设计应该预留充足的时间来完成 HAZOP 分析，但如果项目完成时间紧迫，可能不得不接受上述风险。

1.1.2.2 Current approaches to integrating HAZOP into new projects

HAZOP may not be defined as a legal requirement anywhere in the world but it has been accepted as a standard method. It is recognised as a valid technique in international standards [6] and it is mentioned very widely in guidance from regulators, institutions, and trade bodies.

In other words, companies are free to decide if a HAZOP is required, but if they decide not to perform one or choose to use a different method they had better have a good explanation about why their approach was better.

All significant projects in the process industry are now usually run in stages, often completed by different teams or contractors. As the project progresses through each stage the quality of information and detail improves. But the same issues remain about doing HAZOP too early or too late. One way of overcoming this is to repeat HAZOP several times during a project. The idea being that information about deviations, causes, consequences, and safeguards can be continually improved as the design develops.

As Kletz said, there is no value in doing HAZOP too early. For example during the earliest phase of a project (concept development) the process and its control are not sufficiently developed. At this time a Hazard Identification (HAZID) (another multidisciplinary workshop-based study) is more appropriate for identifying the major hazards and predicting their possible consequences so that design requirements can be identified. HAZOP is used later in the project to provide the detail of how these identified hazards may be realised and controlled, and to identify any that were not evident at the HAZID.

The first realistic opportunity to perform a worthwhile HAZOP is during Front End Engineering Design (FEED) based on PFDs or preliminary P&IDs. It is performed at a high level using a limited set of guidewords. To be useful a basic control logic should be available.

The most important HAZOP is likely to be performed during detailed design, when P&IDs are mature enough that they can be ‘frozen', so that design changes cannot be made until the HAZOP is complete.

HAZOP reports are often a key document in the handover between the teams or contractors performing each phase of the project. They are a valuable reference to show what issues were considered and why the design was considered to be fit for purpose.

1.1.2.2 将 HAZOP 整合到新项目中的当前方法

尽管 HAZOP 可能在世界上任何地方都没有被明确规定为法律要求，但它已经被广泛接受为一种标准方法。它被国际标准 [6] 认可为一种有效技术，并在监管机构、专业机构和行业协会的指导文件中被广泛提及。

换句话说，公司可以自行决定是否需要进行 HAZOP 分析，但如果他们决定不进行或选择使用其他方法，他们最好能够充分解释为什么他们的替代方法更加合适。

如今，化工过程行业的所有重大项目通常都分阶段进行，每个阶段往往由不同的团队或承包商完成。随着项目在各个阶段的推进，信息的质量和细节都会不断改善。但关于 HAZOP 进行的时机是否恰当（太早或太晚）的问题仍然存在。为了解决这个问题，一种方法是在项目期间多次重复进行 HAZOP 分析。这种方法的理念是，随着设计的深入，可以不断完善关于工艺偏差、潜在原因、可能后果和安全保障措施的信息。

正如 Kletz 所指出的，在项目过早的阶段进行 HAZOP（危害与可操作性分析）并不会带来多大价值。举例来说，在项目的最初阶段（概念开发阶段），工艺流程及其控制系统还没有充分发展。此时，更适合进行危险识别（Hazard Identification，HAZID)（另一种基于多学科研讨会的研究方法）来识别主要危险并预测其可能造成的后果，从而确定设计要求。HAZOP 则在项目后期使用，用于详细说明如何实现和控制这些已识别的危险，并识别在 HAZID 中可能未被发现的任何潜在危险。

进行有意义的 HAZOP 分析的第一个实际机会通常是在前端工程设计（Front End Engineering Design，FEED）阶段，基于工艺流程图（Process Flow Diagrams，PFDs）或初步的管道和仪表图（Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams，P&IDs）。这种分析是在高层次上进行的，使用有限的一组引导词（用于引导讨论的关键词或短语）。为了使分析有效，应该有基本的控制逻辑可用。

最关键的 HAZOP 分析可能在详细设计阶段进行，此时 P&IDs 已经足够成熟，可以进入冻结状态，这意味着在 HAZOP 完成之前不能进行设计更改。

HAZOP 报告通常是项目各个阶段之间团队或承包商交接的关键文档。这些报告是非常有价值的参考资料，它们不仅展示了项目中考虑过的各种问题，还说明了为什么认为当前的设计是适合预期用途的。

1.1.2.3 Retrospective HAZOP

There can be a number of reasons why a HAZOP may be carried out retrospectively, for a system that already exists and is in operation. It may be because a HAZOP was not carried out when it was designed, or that changes have occurred which means that the existing HAZOP is no longer representative of its actual operation. Another reason could be to thoroughly check an acquired plant.

A retrospective HAZOP can be carried out in the same way as during design but this may not always be the most effective approach. Having practical experience of operation can help to optimise the process and reduce some uncertainty.

HAZOP can be time consuming and require a lot of resource. Other methods are available that make more use of the additional information available for a retrospective study that may be more appropriate. Process Hazard Review (PHR) is one example. It was also developed by ICI and uses a similar guideword approach. It examines the system at a higher level instead of the detailed nodes used by HAZOP and is reported to be up to five times quicker.

1.1.2.3 回顾性 HAZOP

对于已经存在并正在运行的系统，有时需要进行回顾性的危险与可操作性分析（Hazard and Operability Study，HAZOP），这可能出于以下几个原因：

1. 在系统设计阶段没有进行 HAZOP 分析；
2. 系统发生了变化，导致现有的 HAZOP 分析结果不再能准确反映其实际运行情况；
3. 需要对新收购的工厂进行彻底检查。

虽然回顾性 HAZOP 可以采用与设计阶段相同的方法进行，但这种做法并非总是最有效的。利用实际运行经验可以帮助优化分析过程，并减少一些不确定性。

然而，HAZOP 分析通常耗时较长，且需要大量资源投入。考虑到回顾性研究可以获取更多额外信息，有些其他方法可能更为合适。例如，过程危害评审（Process Hazard Review，PHR）就是一种备选方案。PHR 也是由帝国化学工业公司（Imperial Chemical Industries，ICI）开发的，同样使用引导词方法，但它是在更高层面上检查系统，而不是像 HAZOP 那样深入到详细的节点。据报道，PHR 的分析速度可以比 HAZOP 快五倍。

1.1.2.4 Reviewing previous HAZOP reports

It was common in the past to perform a HAZOP during design, implement any actions, and then file the report away in the archives. This is no longer considered as acceptable and periodic reviews should be carried out to ensure that the study remains relevant and useful. Industries required by law to generate Safety Cases or Safety Reports will usually be expected to review and update these every 4 or 5 years. This seems to be a reasonable frequency for reviewing and updating a HAZOP study and its report.

Things to look for when reviewing a previously completed HAZOP include:

- Creeping changes at the facility due to lots of small hardware and software modifications;

- Changes in the way the system is operated or tasks are performed;

- Evidence from incident reports and other sources that may suggest the HAZOP overlooked certain risks or that the specified controls are inadequate; and

- New information becoming available about hazards and the development of new good practices in industry.

If only minor issues are uncovered during a review it is normally acceptable to update the report, highlighting any changes using standard document control processes. If major issues are found it may be necessary to conduct a retrospective HAZOP or to carry out an alternative assessment for the same purpose such as PHR.

1.1.2.4 审查以往的 HAZOP 报告

过去，人们通常在设计阶段进行危险与可操作性分析（Hazard and Operability Study，HAZOP），实施相应措施，然后将报告存档了事。然而，这种做法如今已不再被认为是恰当的。相反，应该定期审查 HAZOP，以确保其持续相关和有效。法律要求编制安全论证（Safety Cases）或安全报告（Safety Reports）的行业，通常需要每 4 到 5 年审查并更新这些文件。这个频率也适用于 HAZOP 研究及其报告的审查和更新。

在审查之前完成的 HAZOP 时，需要注意以下几点：

- 由于众多小型硬件和软件改动导致的设施渐进式变化；
- 系统操作方式或任务执行方法的改变；
- 来自事故报告和其他来源的证据，可能表明 HAZOP 忽视了某些风险或指定的控制措施不够充分；
- 新出现的危险相关信息以及行业新的最佳实践。

如果审查过程中只发现 minor 问题，通常可以直接更新报告，并使用标准文档控制流程标注变更之处。但如果发现重大问题，可能需要进行回顾性 HAZOP，或者采用其他具有相同目的的评估方法，如工艺危险审查（Process Hazard Review，PHR）。

1.1.3 Why HAZOP?

Kletz explained the reason why HAZOP had to be developed.

Text Box 1.7

The traditional method of identifying hazards—in use from the dawn of technology until the present day—was to build the plant and see what happens—"every dog is allowed one bite". Until it bites someone, we can say that we did not know it would. This is not a bad method when the size of an incident is limited but is no longer satisfactory now that we keep dogs which may be as big as Bhopal (over 2000 killed in one bite) or even Flixborough (28 killed). We need to identify hazards before the accidents occur. Check-lists are often used to identify hazards but their disadvantage is that items on the list are not brought forward for consideration and our minds are closed to them. Check-lists may be satisfactory if there is little or no innovation and all the hazards have been met before, but are least satisfactory when the design is new.

These days, plants are not built ‘to see what happens' and there are very clear duties on companies to do everything reasonably practicable to identify hazards and control risks. HAZOP is probably the most recognised method available to assist with this and there is a high expectation that a HAZOP is carried out for any new major hazard facility, unless another equally effective method is used.

1.1.3 为什么要进行 HAZOP？

Kletz 解释了开发 HAZOP 的原因。

专栏 1.7

从技术诞生之初到现在，识别危险的传统方法一直是先建造工厂，然后看会发生什么 —— 就像人们常说的「每条狗都有一次咬人的机会」。在狗真的咬到人之前，我们可以说我们不知道它会这样做。当事故规模有限时，这种方法还不算太糟，但现在已经不再适用了。因为我们现在面对的「狗」可能如同印度博帕尔事故（一次事故就导致 2000 多人死亡）或英国弗利克斯伯勒事故（造成 28 人死亡）那样「体型巨大」。我们需要在事故发生之前就能识别危险。

检查清单是常用的危险识别方法，但它也有缺点。使用清单时，我们往往只关注清单上的项目，而忽视了可能存在的其他危险，这限制了我们的思考。当面对的是常规情况，所有可能的危险都已知时，检查清单还算有效。但对于新的设计，这种方法就显得不够充分了。

如今，工厂的建造不再是「看看会发生什么」的试错过程。公司有明确的责任，必须采取一切合理可行的措施来识别危险和控制风险。危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）可能是最广为人知的辅助方法。对于任何新的重大危险设施，人们都很期待进行 HAZOP 分析，除非有其他同样有效的方法可以替代。

1.1.4 Alternatives

Motivational theorist Abraham Maslow is quoted as saying "If the only tool you have is a hammer, you will see every problem as a nail." HAZOP is one of our better tools but we have many others available. These include:

- Previous incident reports and analyses;

- Human factors and error assessment;

- Integrity management and review (particularly for aging facilities);

- Reliability analysis;

- Dynamic process simulation;

- Inherent safety review;

- ALARP reviews;

- Process materials and fluids analysis;

- Barrier analysis; and

- Safety critical element reviews and performance standards.

A study of hazard identification methods [9] identified 40 but concluded that HAZOP was one of only a few with any formal guidance. Also, it can be seen that some of the other methods available are adaptations of the standard HAZOP.

1.1.4 替代方法

著名的动机理论心理学家亚伯拉罕·马斯洛曾说过一句名言：「当你手里只有一把锤子时，眼中所有的问题都像是钉子。」虽然危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）是我们最有效的工具之一，但我们还有许多其他可用的方法。这些方法包括：

- 历史事故报告和分析；

- 人因工程和错误评估；

- 完整性管理和审查（尤其针对老旧设施）；

- 可靠性分析；

- 动态过程模拟；

- 本质安全性审查；

- 合理可行低（ALARP）原则审查；

- 工艺材料和流体分析；

- 安全屏障分析；以及

- 安全关键要素审查和性能标准制定。

一项关于危险识别方法的研究 [9] 共识别出 40 种方法，但研究结论指出，HAZOP 是为数不多的几种有正式指导文件的方法之一。此外，我们可以发现，许多其他可用的方法实际上是标准 HAZOP 的变体或改进版本。

1.1.5 Accidents that should have been prevented by HAZOP

Kletz dedicated a whole chapter in his book about HAZOP [2] to describe "some accidents that could have been prevented by HAZOPs." At the time he wrote this it was probably fair to say that HAZOP was relatively uncommon. This meant that Kletz could speculate that an accident happened because of a lack of risk controls because a HAZOP had not been carried out. Things have changed and now the expectation is that HAZOP is carried out and so for more recent accidents it is more reasonable to consider why the HAZOP (or equivalent method) was not effective.

1.1.5 本应被 HAZOP 预防的事故

在 Kletz 撰写的 HAZOP 专著 [2] 中，他用整整一章的篇幅描述了「一些原本可以通过 HAZOP 预防的事故」。在 Kletz 写这本书的时候，HAZOP 的应用还不够普及，这种说法可能是合理的。这意味着 Kletz 可以推测某些事故的发生是由于没有进行 HAZOP 而导致缺乏必要的风险控制措施。然而，如今情况已经发生了变化。现在，进行 HAZOP 分析已成为行业标准做法。因此，对于近期发生的事故，我们更应该思考的是：为什么 HAZOP（或类似的方法）未能有效预防这些事故。

1.1.5.1 Accidents due to ‘reverse flow'

Kletz identified [2] that

Text Box 1.8

Many accidents have occurred because process materials flowed in the opposite direction to that expected and the fact that this could occur was not foreseen. For example, ethylene oxide and amine were reacted to make ethanolamine. Some ammonia flowed from the reactor, in the wrong direction, along the ethylene oxide transfer line into the ethylene oxide tank, past several nonreturn valves and a positive pump. It got past the pump through the relief valve which discharged into the pump suction line. The ammonia reacted with 30 m³ of ethylene oxide in the tank which ruptured violently. The released ethylene oxide vapour exploded causing damage and destruction over a wide area.

A hazard and operability study would have disclosed the fact that reverse flow could occur. On another occasion some paraffin passed from a reactor up a chlorine transfer line and reacted with liquid chlorine in a catchpot. Bits of the catchpot were found 30 m away.

On many occasions process materials have entered service lines, either because the service pressure was lower than usual or the process pressure was higher than usual. The contamination has then spread via the service lines (steam, air, nitrogen, water) to other parts of the plant. On one occasion ethylene entered a steam heater through a leaking heat exchanger. Another branch of the steam line supplied a space heater in the basement of the control room and the condensate was discharged to an open drain inside the building. Ethylene accumulated in the basement, and was ignited (probably by the electric equipment, which was not protected), destroying the building. Again, a HAZOP would have disclosed the route taken by the ethylene.

许多工业事故的发生，是由于过程物料（process materials）意外地逆向流动，而这种可能性往往未被预见到。举个例子，在一次生产乙醇胺的过程中，环氧乙烷（ethylene oxide）与胺类物质发生反应。然而，一些氨气却从反应器中逆流而出，沿着环氧乙烷的输送管线，一路流向环氧乙烷储罐。在这个过程中，氨气竟然穿过了几个止回阀和一台正向泵。它之所以能绕过泵，是通过泵的泄压阀（relief valve），该阀门将流体排放到泵的进口管线。最终，氨气与储罐中 30 立方米的环氧乙烷发生剧烈反应，导致储罐猛烈破裂。释放出的环氧乙烷蒸气随即爆炸，造成了大范围的破坏和毁坏。

如果事先进行危害与可操作性分析（hazard and operability study），就可能发现这种逆流的潜在风险。另一起类似事件中，一些石蜡从反应器沿着氯气输送管线逆流而上，与收集罐（catchpot）中的液态氯发生了反应。事后，人们在 30 米外的地方发现了收集罐的碎片。

在许多情况下，生产过程中使用的物料意外进入了公用工程系统（如蒸汽、空气、氮气、水等），这通常是因为公用工程系统的压力比平常低，或者生产系统的压力比平常高。这种污染随后通过公用工程系统扩散到工厂的其他部分。有一次，乙烯通过泄漏的热交换器进入了蒸汽加热器。蒸汽管线的另一个分支为控制室地下室的空间加热器供应蒸汽，冷凝水则排放到建筑物内的开放式排水沟。结果，乙烯在地下室积聚，并被点燃（可能是由未做防护的电气设备引起），导致整个建筑物被摧毁。值得注意的是，如果事先进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study），本可以发现乙烯泄漏的途径，从而避免这次事故。

1.1.5.2 Texaco Pembroke Refinery (1994)

On 24 July 1994 a severe electrical storm caused major plant disturbances across the whole refinery. Whilst attempting to resume normal operations a large quantity of hydrocarbon was routed to the flare system. Liquids collected in the flare knock-out drum and eventually overflowed into the downstream flare pipework, which failed leading to a significant release. This ignited and exploded, leading to significant damage to the site and beyond. There were some injuries but fortunately no one was killed.

The flare knock-out drum had originally been designed so that any liquid collected would drain away automatically to slops. Modifications had been made to return the liquid to the process in order to reduce waste, but which significantly reduced the rate that liquid could be removed from the drum. A HAZOP of this modification should have identified that during major plant upsets the flow of liquid to the drum would have been greater than the capacity of the new draining system and also, that high level in the drum could result in liquid breakthrough into the downstream pipework, which was not designed to handle this (Fig. 1.2).

FIG. 1.2 The arrangement of flare drum liquid handling before and after modifications.

1.1.5.2 德士古彭布罗克炼油厂事故（1994 年）

1994 年 7 月 24 日，一场强烈的雷暴天气导致英国威尔士彭布罗克郡的德士古炼油厂（Texaco Pembroke Refinery）全面出现严重的运行故障。在尝试恢复正常运营的过程中，大量烃类物质被输送到火炬系统（用于安全燃烧多余气体的装置）。液态烃类物质积聚在火炬分离罐（用于分离气液的容器）中，最终溢出进入下游的火炬管道，导致管道失效，引发大量泄漏。这些泄漏的烃类物质随后被点燃并爆炸，对炼油厂及其周边地区造成了严重损害。虽然有一些人员受伤，但幸运的是没有造成人员死亡。

火炬系统中的分液罐（flare knock-out drum）最初设计是为了将收集的液体自动排入废液处理系统。为了减少废物，工厂进行了改造，将液体重新引回生产流程中。然而，这一改动显著降低了分液罐排出液体的速度。对这项改造进行的危险和可操作性分析（Hazard and Operability Study，HAZOP）本应识别出两个潜在问题：首先，在重大工艺 upset 期间，流入分液罐的液体量可能超过新排液系统的处理能力；其次，分液罐液位过高可能导致液体突破进入下游管道，而这些管道并未设计用于处理液体（图 1.2）。

图 1.2 改造前后火炬分液罐液体处理系统的布置图。

1.1.5.3 Electrostatic precipitator explosion

An explosion occurred on 18 February 2015 at a refinery in Torrance, California. A pressure deviation during preparation for maintenance allowed hydrocarbon to backflow into an electrostatic precipitator where it ignited and exploded, damaging the equipment and injuring four people in the area. The hydrocarbon was able to backflow because a side valve, which was being used as the isolation, had been eroded by solid catalyst that passed through.

it during normal operation. This valve had been identified as safety critical but the steps taken by the refinery to prove its integrity only confirmed that mechanical components were working and not whether it was effective as an isolation.

A HAZOP of this system should have identified that pressure deviations could occur and that these would result in hydrocarbon back-flowing through the slide valve to the electrostatic precipitator where ignition was likely to have occurred. It should have highlighted that an effective isolation would be required to avoid this and that a single slide valve that was used for control was very unlikely to be sufficient for this purpose.

1.1.5.3 静电除尘器爆炸事故

2015 年 2 月 18 日，美国加利福尼亚州托兰斯市的一家炼油厂发生了爆炸事故。在准备维护工作期间，由于压力异常，导致含碳化合物的物质倒流进入静电除尘器（一种用于去除气体中颗粒物的设备）。这些化合物在除尘器中被点燃并引发爆炸，造成设备损坏，并导致现场四人受伤。化合物之所以能够倒流，是因为用作隔离的侧阀在日常运行中被流过的固体催化剂（一种用于加速化学反应的物质）腐蚀。虽然这个阀门被认定为关键安全设备，但炼油厂在验证其完整性时，只确认了机械部件的工作状态，而没有检查它是否能有效起到隔离作用。

对该系统进行的危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）本应识别出可能发生的压力异常情况。这些异常会导致碳氢化合物（主要是石油和天然气的成分）通过滑动阀门倒流至静电除尘器（一种用于去除气体中颗粒物的设备），而在那里很可能发生点燃。分析还应该强调，需要有效的隔离措施来避免这种情况，而仅仅使用一个用于控制的滑动阀门很可能不足以达到这个目的。

1.1.5.4 Esso Longford

Kletz referred to the Esso Longford accident to illustrate how HAZOP could have prevented it [12].

Text Box 1.9

On 25 September 1998 a heat exchanger in the Esso gas plant in Longford, Victoria, Australia fractured, releasing hydrocarbon vapours and liquids. Explosions and a fire followed, killing two employees and injuring eight. Supplies of natural gas were interrupted throughout the State of Victoria and were not fully restored until 14 October. There was no alternative supply of gas and many industrial and domestic users were without fuel for all or part of the time that the plant was shut down.

Many companies have examined their older plants to judge their fitness for purpose, including the suitability of the materials of construction. Some equipment is replaced so that it can withstand fault conditions. In other cases control and trip systems are improved, instructions revised or the need to avoid low temperature avenues emphasised in operator training. Esso, part of the US Exxon company, decided to carry out hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) on all the old plants on their Longford site. Most of them were completed but the 1969 plant, the oldest on the site, was never studied. According to the official Report (p. 203), ‘no satisfactory reason was given in evidence for its deferral or abandonment'. A HAZOP almost certainly would have disclosed that the heat exchanger that failed could become too cold and would have led to a systematic examination of the ways in which this could occur and the actions that might be taken to prevent it. It would also have disclosed the need to provide better isolations in the connecting lines to the other units.

1.1.5.4 Esso Longford 事故

Kletz 引用了「Esso Longford」事故来说明 HAZOP 分析如何可以预防类似事故的发生 [12]。

文本框 1.9

1998 年 9 月 25 日，位于澳大利亚维多利亚州 Longford 的 Esso 天然气工厂发生了一起严重事故。一个热交换器破裂，释放出碳氢化合物蒸气和液体。随后发生爆炸和火灾，导致两名员工不幸遇难，另有八人受伤。这起事故造成整个维多利亚州的天然气供应中断，直到 10 月 14 日才完全恢复。由于没有替代的天然气供应，许多工业和家庭用户在工厂关闭期间的全部或部分时间内都无法获得燃料，影响巨大。

许多公司已经对其老旧工厂进行了检查，以评估其是否仍然适合使用，包括建筑材料的适用性。一些设备被更换，以便能够承受故障情况。在其他情况下，控制和安全停机系统得到改进，操作指令被修订，或者在操作员培训中强调了避免低温影响的重要性。埃克森美孚旗下的埃索公司决定对其朗福德场地的所有老旧工厂进行危险和可操作性研究（Hazard and Operability Studies，HAZOPs）。大部分研究已经完成，但是建于 1969 年的工厂，即该场地最古老的工厂，从未被研究过。根据官方报告（第 203 页），「证据中没有给出令人满意的理由来解释为什么推迟或放弃对该工厂的研究」。如果进行了 HAZOP，几乎肯定会发现失效的热交换器可能会变得过冷，并会导致对这种情况发生的方式以及可能采取的预防措施进行系统性检查。它还会揭示需要在连接其他单元的管线上提供更好的隔离措施。

1.1.6 Ensuring effective HAZOP

Kletz had some concerns that people underestimated the HAZOP method, viewing it as one of the "hammers and spanners of the chemical industry" [2].

Text Box 1.10

This makes them sound too easy. They are, in fact, sophisticated tools which require long, detailed application. They are not quick fixes.

He saw that part of the problem was that, as it has become ubiquitous, people would assume that studies would automatically become ‘better and better'. His response to this view was as follows [2].

Text Box 1.11

In some ways this is true; the best are getting better. However, as with any technique, as more and more people start to use it the standard can easily fall and it can become a perfunctory exercise, carried out because the company rules (or the regulators) require it and not because those present really feel that it is worthwhile. Some auditing of the quality of HAZOPs is therefore desirable.

The key message is that HAZOP requires respect and resources. Companies should have procedures in place that define the requirements, use competent team leaders, and always involve the right people. As with all processes, continual review and audit is required. Kletz gave this perspective [2].

Text Box 1.12

As the use of any technique becomes more widespread its quality is liable to decrease. There is therefore a need to be able to audit the quality of a HAZOP. At a workshop on HAZOP held in 1995 the auditing of HAZOP was selected as the most pressing current topic. The best method of auditing is to sit in on a HAZOP. If that is not practicable—for example, because the HAZOP is complete—Rushton has described an audit scheme. The auditor samples the documentation produced by the HAZOP and looks for evidence that various modes of operation—such as start-up, shutdown and maintenance—have been considered in addition to normal operation, that the knowledge and experience of the team members were adequate, that the same people attended throughout and did so regularly, that the recommendations made were carried out, and that any late changes in design were studied. If the plant has already been commissioned the auditor should examine the problems that have arisen and see if they could reasonably have been spotted during the HAZOP. Altogether there are six aspects of suggested questions. The auditor should talk to the team members to gain their impressions and assess their knowledge and experience.

1.1.6 确保 HAZOP 的有效性

Kletz 担心人们低估了 HAZOP 方法，认为它只是「化工行业的常用工具之一」[2]。

文本框 1.10

这种看法让 HAZOP 听起来过于简单。事实上，它们是复杂的工具，需要长期、细致的应用。它们不是快速解决问题的方法。

他意识到问题的一部分在于，随着这种方法的普及，人们会自然而然地认为研究会「越来越好」。对于这种观点，他的回应如下 [2]。

专栏 1.11

从某些方面来说，这确实是真的；最好的研究确实在变得更好。然而，就像任何技术一样，当越来越多的人开始使用它时，标准很容易下降。它可能会变成一种例行公事，人们执行它仅仅是因为公司规定（或监管机构）要求，而不是因为参与者真的认为它有价值。因此，对危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）的质量进行一些审核是很有必要的。

关键信息是 HAZOP 需要得到尊重，并且需要足够的资源投入。公司应该建立明确的程序来定义要求，使用称职的团队领导，并始终确保合适的人员参与。与所有流程一样，HAZOP 也需要持续的检查和审核。Kletz 对此给出了如下见解 [2]。

专栏 1.12

随着任何技术的普及，其质量往往会有所下降。因此，我们需要有能力对危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）的质量进行审核。在 1995 年举行的 HAZOP 研讨会上，与会者将 HAZOP 的审核确定为当时最紧迫的议题。

审核 HAZOP 的最佳方法是亲自参与 HAZOP 会议。然而，如果这不可行 —— 比如 HAZOP 已经结束 —— 那么我们可以采用 Rushton 提出的审核方案。根据这个方案，审核员需要对 HAZOP 生成的文档进行抽样检查，寻找以下几个方面的证据：

1、是否考虑了各种运行模式，如启动、关闭和维护等，而不仅仅是正常运行。

2、团队成员的知识和经验是否足够。

3、是否有固定的人员全程参与并定期出席会议。

4、提出的建议是否得到了执行。

5、后期的设计变更是否得到了充分研究。

如果工厂已经开始运营，审核员还应该检查已经出现的问题，评估这些问题是否本可以在 HAZOP 过程中被合理地识别出来。Rushton 的审核方案共包括六个方面的建议问题。除此之外，审核员还应该与团队成员进行交谈，了解他们的印象，并评估他们的知识水平和经验。

通过这种全面的审核过程，我们可以确保 HAZOP 的质量，进而提高整个系统的安全性和可操作性。

### 1.2 HAZOP organisation and process

Although HAZOP provides a method for performing a hazard analysis it relies on people to identify the relevant deviations, recognise potential hazards, and make reasonable judgements about existing safeguards and potential new ones.

1.2 危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）的组织和流程

尽管危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）提供了一种进行危害分析的方法，但它仍然依赖于人来识别相关的偏差，认识潜在的危害，并对现有的安全措施和可能的新措施做出合理的判断。

1.2.1 Organising a HAZOP

From a technical perspective a HAZOP cannot take place until there is enough information about the system being assessed. For process plant this is when an up-to-date and ‘frozen' set of P&IDs are available. Once this is achieved there are three key factors for a successful HAZOP:

- A committed, knowledgeable, and creative team;

- An experienced and competent Team Leader; and

- Meeting organisation.

1.2.1 组织 HAZOP

从技术角度来看，只有在获得足够的系统信息后，才能进行 HAZOP。对于化工厂来说，这意味着需要有最新的、已「冻结」的管道仪表图（P&IDs）。一旦具备这些条件，成功实施 HAZOP 还需要三个关键因素：

- 一个敬业、知识渊博且富有创造力的团队；

- 一个经验丰富、能力出众的团队领导；以及

- 良好的会议组织。

1.2.1.1 HAZOP team members

The make-up of the team has a significant impact on the quality of a HAZOP. The challenge is to get a group of people together who cover a range of knowledge and experience whilst keeping the process manageable. Also, to involve people who can be creative and are willing to discuss the issues. Kletz identified the following people to be involved in a HAZOP for a new facility [2].

Text Box 1.13

Project or design engineer

Usually a mechanical engineer and, at this stage of the project, the person responsible for keeping the costs within the sum sanctioned. The project engineer wants to minimise changes but at the same time find out now rather than later if there are any unknown hazards or operating problems.

Process engineer

Usually the chemical engineer who drew up the flowsheet.

Commissioning manager

Usually a chemical engineer, the commissioning manager will have to start up and operate the plant and is therefore inclined to press for any changes that will make life easier.

Control system design engineer

Modern plants contain sophisticated control and trip systems and HAZOPs often result in the addition of yet more instrumentation.

Research Chemist

If new chemistry is involved.

The importance of the HAZOP in verifying the safety and operability of the plant and the expense of modifications means that the Project Manager will usually attend for some if not all of the HAZOP.

Whilst Kletz suggested that ‘modern plants' would require a higher input from control systems engineers this may no longer be the case because most control software is usually not bespoke. However, knowledge of the control logic is required including any role it has in safeguarding to prevent or mitigate hazardous scenarios.

Kletz pointed out that the make-up of the team may vary according to the nature of the design process, for example [2].

Text Box 1.14

If the plant has been designed by a contractor, the HAZOP team should contain people from both the contractor and client organisation, and certain functions may have to be duplicated.

HAZOP practices have evolved and the team make-up has probably changed since Kletz first started writing on the subject. For example, it is increasingly recognised that involving experienced operators and maintenance technicians is a critical factor in achieving a good HAZOP. They are the people who know what actually happens, what works, and what doesn't. This is particularly the case for a retrospective or modification HAZOP, but even for a completely new facility practical experience can provide a real insight into potential issues that designers and project engineers might not recognise. Also, people who have spent their working lives at the sharp end of operations have usually developed robust and effective communication skills that can help the whole team focus on the critical issues and avoid getting hung up on trivia and interesting but irrelevant technical details.

Another key member of the HAZOP team, who was not mentioned by Kletz, is the Scribe. They are usually a junior process engineer. Their role is to record the HAZOP inputs and outputs, but they are still a full team member and should be able to contribute to the technical discussions. They need to understand the discussions that take place, be reasonably quick at taking notes (typically directly on a computer nowadays), and be prepared to slow down the meeting and ask for clarification if required. The scribe usually does most of the organisational legwork, for example assembling documentation. It has been reported that "a good scribe can cut 30% of the time taken to complete a HAZOP, whereas a bad scribe can virtually wreck it."

One of the concerns of inviting people who are not usually directly involved in design (particularly operators and maintenance technicians) is that they are not familiar with the method. In fact some people invited to a HAZOP may be worried that they may struggle to understand what is going on. Kletz pointed out that team members are invited due to their knowledge and experience and are not expected to be experts at HAZOP.

Text Box 1.15

HAZOP teams, apart from the team leader, do not require much training. They can pick up the techniques as they go along. If anyone is present for the first time, the team leader should start with 10 min of explanation. However, if possible, new team members should attend a half-day lecture and discussion based on this chapter. The Institution of Chemical Engineers can supply a training package. The team leader should, however, start the discussion of each line or plant item by explaining, or asking someone to explain, its purpose.

Another key point, highlighted by Kletz, is that the value of the input made by team members is not restricted to their technical knowledge. In fact it is often their willingness to discuss the things that they do not understand that can add the most value. It is worth noting that the designers should have already considered the well-known and understood hazards and operability issues and so it is the quirky and unusual potential issues that are of most concern.

Text Box 1.16

It might be thought that membership of a HAZOP team is "the proper toil of artless industry, a task that requires neither the light of learning, nor the activity of genius, but may he successfully performed without any higher quality than that of bearing burthens with dull patience and ... sluggish resolution," to quote Dr. Johnson. This is not the case. The best team members are creative and uninhibited people who can think of new and original ways for things to go wrong and are not too shy to suggest them. In a HAZOP, do not hesitate to suggest impossibly crazy deviations, causes, consequences or solutions as they may lead other people to think of similar but possible deviations, etc. Zetlin writes. "I look at everything and try to imagine disaster. I am always scared. Imagination and fear are among the best engineering tools for preventing tragedy.

A final point made by Kletz is that the status of the team and its members can have a big impact on a HAZOP.

Text Box 1.17

The team should have the authority to agree most changes there and then. Progress is slow if every change has to be referred to someone who is not present. The team members should try to avoid sending deputies. They lack the knowledge of previous meetings and might not have the authority to approve changes: as a result progress is held up. Some people have told me that this is impractical in their companies as all changes have to be approved at a high level. This does not matter so long as the team members feel confident that most of their recommendations will be accepted without argument. However, if the discussions in the HAZOP meetings have to be gone through again, time is wasted.

1.2.1.1 HAZOP 团队成员

团队的组成对 HAZOP 的质量有重大影响。挑战在于如何组织一群具有广泛知识和经验的人员，同时保持过程可控。此外，还需要吸引那些富有创新精神并愿意讨论问题的人参与其中。Kletz 指出，以下人员应该参与新设施的 HAZOP [2]。

专栏 1.13：HAZOP 团队核心成员项目或设计工程师：
通常是一名机械工程师，在项目的这个阶段负责将成本控制在批准的预算内。项目工程师希望尽量减少变更，但同时也希望尽早发现任何未知的危害或操作问题，而不是在项目后期才发现。

工艺工程师：

在进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）时，通常需要多个领域的专家参与。以下是常见的参与者及其角色：

流程工程师：通常是绘制流程图的化学工程师。

调试经理（Commissioning manager)：通常也是一名化学工程师。他负责启动和运营工厂，因此倾向于推动任何能简化操作的变更。

控制系统设计工程师（Control system design engineer)：现代工厂包含复杂的控制和安全联锁系统，HAZOP 分析常常会导致增加更多的仪器设备。

研究化学家：如果涉及新的化学反应，则需要他们的专业知识。

由于 HAZOP 在验证工厂安全性和可操作性方面的重要性，以及可能导致的昂贵修改，项目经理通常会参加部分或全部的 HAZOP 会议。

Kletz 曾建议「现代工厂」会需要控制系统工程师的更多投入。然而，如今这种情况可能已经改变，因为大多数控制软件通常不是定制的。尽管如此，仍然需要了解控制逻辑，特别是它在预防或减轻危险情况中的作用。

Kletz 还指出，团队的组成可能会根据设计过程的性质而有所不同 [2]。

表 1.14：HAZOP 团队组成的特殊情况如果工厂是由承包商设计的，HAZOP 团队应该包括来自承包商和客户组织的人员。在这种情况下，某些职能可能需要在两个组织中都有代表，以确保全面的分析和沟通。

危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）的实践方法已经有了长足的发展。自从 Trevor Kletz（一位在化工安全领域颇有建树的专家）最初开始撰写这个主题以来，HAZOP 团队的组成也可能发生了显著变化。例如，业界越来越认识到，让经验丰富的操作员和维护技术人员参与其中，是实现高质量 HAZOP 分析的关键因素。这些一线工作人员最了解实际情况，清楚哪些方法行之有效，哪些则不然。

这种做法在进行已有设施的回顾性评估或针对设施改造的 HAZOP 分析时尤为重要。不过，即使是对全新的设施进行分析，这些实践经验也能为潜在问题提供独到见解，而这些问题可能是设计师和项目工程师所未曾察觉的。

此外，长期在生产运营一线工作的人员通常已经培养出了稳健而有效的沟通技能。这些技能可以帮助整个团队聚焦于关键问题，避免在琐碎细节或有趣但无关紧要的技术问题上浪费时间。他们的参与可以使 HAZOP 分析更加高效、切中要害，从而提高整个过程的质量和效果。

HAZOP（危害与可操作性分析）团队中还有一个 Kletz 没有提到的关键成员，那就是记录者（Scribe）。这个角色通常由一名初级过程工程师担任。记录者的主要职责是记录 HAZOP 的输入和输出，但他们同时也是团队的正式成员，应该能够为技术讨论做出贡献。他们需要理解讨论的内容，能够快速记录笔记（如今通常直接使用电脑），并在必要时请求与会者放慢讨论速度或要求澄清。记录者通常还负责大部分准备工作，例如整理相关文档。有报告指出，「一个优秀的记录者可以减少 30% 的 HAZOP 完成时间，而一个不称职的记录者几乎可能导致整个分析无法进行。」

邀请那些通常不直接参与设计的人员（特别是操作员和维护技术人员）参与 HAZOP 时，一个常见的担忧是他们可能不熟悉这种分析方法。事实上，一些被邀请参加 HAZOP 的人可能会担心自己难以理解讨论内容。对此，Kletz 指出，团队成员是因为他们的专业知识和经验而被邀请的，并不要求他们成为 HAZOP 方法的专家。

文框 1.15

除了团队领导外，危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）团队成员不需要太多培训。他们可以在实践中逐步掌握这些技巧。如果有人是首次参与，团队领导应该花 10 分钟进行简要说明。然而，如果条件允许，新团队成员最好能参加基于本章内容的半天讲座和讨论。英国化学工程师学会（Institution of Chemical Engineers）可以提供相关的培训资料。无论如何，团队领导在开始讨论每条生产线或工厂设备时，都应该先解释或指派 someone 解释其用途。

Kletz 强调的另一个关键点是，团队成员的贡献价值并不仅限于他们的专业知识。实际上，他们愿意讨论自己不理解的事情往往能带来最大的价值。值得注意的是，设计人员应该已经考虑过常见的和被充分理解的危害及操作性问题，因此那些特殊和不寻常的潜在问题才是最值得关注的。

专栏 1.16

人们可能会认为，成为危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）团队的成员是一项「不需要技巧的单调工作，既不需要渊博的学识，也不需要天才的创造力，只要具备迟钝的耐心和缓慢的决心就能完成」—— 用约翰逊博士的话来说。然而，事实并非如此。最优秀的团队成员往往是富有创造力和思想开放的人，他们能够想象出新颖独特的事故发生方式，并且有勇气提出这些想法。在 HAZOP 分析中，不要害怕提出看似荒谬的偏差、原因、后果或解决方案，因为这些想法可能会激发其他人思考类似但切实可行的情况。正如 Zetlin 所说：「我观察一切，并试图预想可能发生的灾难。我总是保持警惕。想象力和谨慎是预防悲剧发生的最佳工程工具。」

Kletz 还指出了一个重要观点：团队及其成员的地位可能会对 HAZOP 分析的效果产生重大影响。这提醒我们，在进行这类分析时，不仅要关注技术细节，还要考虑团队动态和组织因素。

文本框 1.17

团队应该有权力现场决定大部分变更。如果每个变更都需要请示未出席会议的人，进度就会变得缓慢。团队成员应该尽量避免委派他人代替出席。这些代表缺乏之前会议的背景知识，可能也没有批准变更的权力，结果就会导致进展受阻。有些人告诉我，在他们的公司里这种做法不太可行，因为所有变更都必须经过高层批准。只要团队成员有信心他们的大多数建议能够顺利通过，这其实并不是问题。但是，如果危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）会议中的讨论不得不重复进行，那就会造成时间浪费。

1.2.1.2 Team leader

The Team Leader is critical for any HAZOP and their ability to use the method, control the workshop, and manage the overall process will have a significant impact on the quality of the outcomes. Kletz summed up the main requirements.

Text Box 1.18

Independent team leader

An expert in the HAZOP technique, not the plant. The job of the team leader is to ensure that the team follows the procedure. To be a successful team leader you need to be skilled in leading a team.

of people who are not responsible to you, and be the sort of person who pays meticulous attention to detail. It is easy to underestimate the ability required. It is not a job that anyone can do. The team leader may also supply the safety department's view on the points dictated. If not, a representative from this department should be present.

The Team Leader needs to ensure that the HAZOP participants play their part in the workshop. They need to facilitate the discussion so that everyone is actively involved and is prepared to discuss issues without becoming side-tracked. All contributions should be constructive so that solutions are identified and not just potential problems. The Team Leader should be independent of the project and some companies insist that they are provided by an external organisation (i.e. a consultant). The Team Leader should have received some formal, certified training.

Other traits of a good Team Leader include knowledge of other methods (e.g. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA), HAZID, attention to detail, and enough stamina to adhere to the method for the full duration). They need to be able to handle people, particularly the dominant personalities that may be inclined to take over the meeting and dissuade others from talking. This can be a particular problem if this person is an engineer who is overly defensive of their design.

Kletz pointed out that motivating the team is vitally important.

Text Box 1.19

Although HAZOP is a valuable technique, no-one jumps out of bed on a Monday morning shouting, ‘Hooray! I've got a HAZOP today!'. The need to consider every deviation on every line can become tedious. Beware of making it more so by bureaucratic procedures such as insisting on excessive recording or discussing everything twice (or three times)—in the HAZOP meeting and afterwards with the boss of the project team. There is a net loss if, in our eagerness to document everything to explain it to everybody, we discover less information worth documenting. If HAZOP and similar systems are not acceptable to creative minds, they will never succeed.

It is possible for the Team Leader's involvement to be limited to the duration of the workshop, with a short time later to review a report prepared by the Scribe or others. In this case they are relying on others to prepare and organise the HAZOP. This may be the case if an external consultant has been engaged for the role. In practice the HAZOP will generally run more smoothly and efficiently if the Team Leader has oversight of the whole organisation and is actively involved in planning the time requirements, selecting the team, establishing the support requirements, and developing the terms of reference for the study. This is important because resources are always limited and any inefficiency will reduce the time available for conducting the HAZOP and will inevitably affect the scope covered and/or depth of assessment carried out.

1.2.1.2 团队领导

团队领导对任何 HAZOP 都至关重要，他们运用该方法的能力、主持研讨会的水平以及管理整个过程的技巧都会对最终结果的质量产生重大影响。Kletz 总结了作为团队领导的主要要求。

【专栏 1.18】独立团队领导的特质

- HAZOP 技术专家，而非工厂专家

- 工作职责是确保团队遵循正确的流程

- 成功的团队领导需要具备出色的团队管理能力

团队领导的职责是确保危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）的参与者在讨论会中充分发挥作用。他们需要引导讨论，使每个人都能积极参与，并准备讨论问题而不偏离主题。所有的意见都应该是建设性的，目的是找出解决方案，而不仅仅是指出潜在问题。团队领导应该与项目保持独立，不直接参与项目的设计或执行，以保持客观性。一些公司甚至坚持从外部聘请顾问来担任团队领导。无论如何，团队领导都应该接受过正式的、经过认证的培训。

一个优秀的团队领导还应具备其他特质，包括熟悉其他风险分析方法（例如失效模式与影响分析（FMEA)、保护层分析（LOPA)、危险识别（HAZID）等），具有敏锐的洞察力，以及能够在整个过程中始终如一地坚持方法论的毅力。他们需要具备出色的人际交往能力，特别是要能够应对那些可能试图主导会议并压制他人发言的强势人物。如果这个强势人物恰好是一位对自己的设计过分维护的工程师，情况可能会变得特别棘手。

著名化工安全专家 Trevor Kletz 曾指出，激励团队是至关重要的。一个积极性高、团结协作的团队能够更有效地识别潜在风险并提出创新的解决方案，从而显著提高 HAZOP 分析的质量和效果。

尽管危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）是一种有价值的技术，但没有人会对参加 HAZOP 分析感到异常兴奋。这种需要考虑每个环节中每种可能偏差的方法可能会让人感到枯燥。我们要警惕不要通过一些繁琐的流程使其变得更加乏味，比如坚持过度记录或重复讨论每个问题（两次或三次）—— 在 HAZOP 会议上讨论一次，之后又与项目团队负责人讨论。如果我们过于急于记录所有细节以向所有人解释，反而可能导致发现的有价值信息减少，这将适得其反。如果 HAZOP 和类似的系统方法无法被具有创造力的人接受，那么它们就难以取得成功。

团队负责人的参与可能仅限于研讨会的持续时间，以及之后短暂审阅由记录人或其他成员准备的报告。在这种情况下，他们依赖其他人来准备和组织危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Analysis）。这种情况可能发生在聘请外部顾问担任这个角色时。然而实践表明，如果团队负责人对整个组织有全面的了解，并积极参与规划时间安排、选择团队成员、确定所需支持以及制定研究目标和范围，HAZOP 通常会进行得更加顺利和高效。这一点至关重要，因为资源总是有限的，任何效率的损失都会减少实际进行 HAZOP 的时间，并不可避免地影响到分析的覆盖范围和 / 或深度。

1.2.1.3 Meeting organisation

HAZOP is performed by a group of people working together in a meeting or workshop. The way this meeting is conducted will have a significant impact on the quality of the assessment and output.

The factors that affect a HAZOP meeting are largely the same as any other type of meeting. A shared understanding of objectives amongst attendees, good preparation and time management, strong leadership, and all participants taking an active and pragmatic approach will have positive influences. A suitable venue and equipment will help the meeting to progress and management commitment is essential to ensure attendance of the right people at the right time. Kletz highlighted that adhering to a systematic approach is vital. The meeting must be managed to avoid aimless discussion and straying off on tangents.

Text Box 1.20

The complexity of modern plants makes it difficult or impossible to see what might go wrong unless we go through the design systematically. Few accidents occur because the design team members lack knowledge; most errors in design occur because they fail to apply their knowledge. HAZOP gives them an opportunity to go through the design line by line, deviation by deviation, to see what they have missed.

The time required to conduct a HAZOP is often a bone of contention. Kletz tended to take the view that it will take as long as it requires and advocated that the meetings themselves should be limited in their duration and frequency to avoid fatigue of team members and the temptation to rush the HAZOP.

Text Box 1.21

A HAZOP usually takes 1.5-3 hr per main plant item (still, furnace, reactor, heater, and so on). If the plant is similar to an existing one it will take 1.5 hr per item but if the process is new it may take 3 hr per item. Inexperienced teams of course, take longer than experienced ones. Meetings are usually restricted to 3 hr, or 2-3 days per week to give the team time to attend to their other duties and because the imagination tires after 3 hr at a stretch. If the members of the team have to be gathered from a distance, longer periods of working, perhaps every morning for a week, may have to be accepted. Resist any temptation to work 8 or more hours per day for a week, as attention inevitably flags. It is the results of a HAZOP that are important, not the number of hours spent on it.

The times proposed by Kletz may have been a bit optimistic because a complicated system such as a reactor might take a lot longer than 3 hr to complete. Using an average of 4-5 hr per P&ID or an average of 3 hr per subsystem may provide a reasonable estimate for planning. However, planning should include input from an experienced team leader who will be able to give more accurate estimates of time, which can avoid arbitrary plans being set based on resources perceived to be available.

The suggestion that HAZOPs should not occupy full, consecutive days remains appropriate and valid. Unfortunately it is a guideline that is often overlooked, particularly in major projects. The problem is that adhering to these restrictions will have a significant impact on schedule. If the HAZOP results in a delay in project delivery it will be very unpopular and the impact that this has on perceptions of the role of process safety and reasonableness of approach may be counter-productive. If the schedule dictates that full and consecutive days are required, then the potential issues with fatigue of team members and hence the quality of the HAZOP output need to be factored into the overall approach being taken to address process safety.

The approach taken by the Team Leader can have a significant effect on how the HAZOP meeting progresses. Kletz identified a range of issues that they need to manage [2]:

Text Box 1.22

While the team members have a common objective—a safe and operable plant—the constraints on them are different. The designers, especially the design engineer responsible for costs, want to keep the costs down. The commissioning manager wants an easy start-up. This conflict of interests ensures that the pros and cons of each proposal are thoroughly explored before an agreed decision is reached. However, if the design engineer has a much stronger personality than the other members, they may stray too far towards economy. Other teams may err the other way. The team leader tries to correct any imbalance. To quote Sir John Harvey-Jones, "In industry the optimal level of conflict is not zero."

One of the most common causes of disruption of the team and inefficient HAZOP is spending too much time on discussion of design changes. The HAZOP is not a design meeting. If the solution to an identified problem is not obvious, the Team Leader must quickly guide the team to formulate an action and move on [2].

Text Box 1.23

If the team cannot agree, the team leader should suggest that the point is considered outside the meeting. Sometimes a decision is postponed while expert advice is sought—for example, from a materials expert—or even while research is carried out. Sometimes a decision is postponed so that a quantitative estimate of the hazard can be made.

One common failure from HAZOP (and other safety studies) is poorly defined actions. For example:

- Actions that ask people to ‘Consider' an issue without any clear acceptance criteria so that they can be closed without any action taken or any justification;

- Actions that make sense when raised during the HAZOP but on their own are difficult to interpret or are ambiguous outside of the meeting; and

- Actions that are too specific so that they can be closed by a simple design change that does not address more fundamental and wide-ranging issues.

Actions from HAZOPs must be "written sufficiently clearly that the discipline engineers implement the intent of the action; and not just the title" [15]. Sometimes it is not possible to formulate the wording correctly in the workshop and it is usually acceptable for the Team

e Sir John Harvey Jones was a flamboyant Chairman of ICI and broadcaster.

Leader and Scribe to have a wash-up session afterwards to finalize details including wording of actions. This should be done very soon after the workshop with any changes communicated to the HAZOP team to allow them to comment.

Overall, it must be recognized that HAZOPs take up significant resources. The people who attend will usually have lots of other work to be done, whether that be progressing the design for a new project or operating an existing facility. Whilst the HAZOP is important, there can be no justification for using time inefficiently due to poor organization and planning. Identifying in advance similar nodes or areas where the HAZOP will become very repetitive can allow for a different approach to be taken to maintain interest and attention of the team so that they will continue to pay close attention and be actively involved.

1.2.1.3 HAZOP 会议的组织与实施

HAZOP 是由一组人在会议或研讨会中共同完成的。会议的组织和进行方式将对评估的质量和最终成果产生重大影响。

影响危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）会议的因素在很大程度上与其他类型会议相似。与会者之间对目标的共同理解、充分的准备和有效的时间管理、有力的领导，以及所有参与者积极务实的态度都将产生积极影响。合适的场地和设备有助于会议顺利进行，而管理层的支持则是确保合适人员准时出席的关键。特雷弗·克莱茨（Trevor Kletz）强调，坚持系统性方法至关重要。会议主持人必须有效管理讨论，避免无目的的发散和偏离主题。

专栏 1.20

现代工厂的复杂性使得我们难以预见可能出现的问题，除非系统地审查设计。设计团队成员知识不足导致的事故很少；设计中的大多数错误发生是因为他们未能充分运用已有的知识。HAZOP 为他们提供了一个机会，通过逐行、逐个偏差地检查设计，发现可能被忽视的问题。

进行 HAZOP 所需的时间常常是一个争议焦点。克莱茨倾向于认为应该根据实际需要来决定时间长短，他主张限制会议的持续时间和频率，以避免团队成员疲劳，同时防止为赶进度而草率完成分析的情况发生。

专栏 1.21

危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）通常对每个主要工厂设备（如蒸馏塔、炉子、反应器、加热器等）需要 1.5-3 小时。如果工厂与现有工厂相似，每个设备只需 1.5 小时，但如果是新工艺，可能需要 3 小时。当然，缺乏经验的团队比有经验的团队需要更长时间。会议通常限制在 3 小时内，或每周 2-3 天，这样可以让团队有时间处理其他职责，同时也是因为连续思考 3 小时后，人的想象力会变得疲劳。如果团队成员需要从远处聚集，可能不得不接受更长的工作时间，比如一周内每天上午。但要注意抵制一周内每天工作 8 小时或更长时间的诱惑，因为长时间工作 inevitably 会导致注意力下降。记住，HAZOP 的结果才是重要的，而不是花在上面的时间。

Kletz 提出的时间估计可能有点乐观，因为像反应器这样复杂的系统可能需要远超过 3 小时才能完成分析。为了合理规划，可以使用平均每份管道仪表图（P&ID）4-5 小时或每个子系统（subsystem）平均 3 小时作为估算基准。然而，在制定计划时，应该征求有经验的团队领导的意见，他们能够提供更准确的时间估计。这样可以避免仅仅基于可用资源而制定出不切实际的计划。

建议危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）不应占用连续的整天时间，这一观点仍然是恰当和有效的。遗憾的是，这一指导原则经常被忽视，尤其是在大型项目中。问题在于，严格遵守这些限制将对项目进度产生重大影响。如果 HAZOP 导致项目交付延迟，它将很可能招致不满。这种不满可能会对人们对过程安全（指在工业过程中预防和控制可能导致事故的风险）重要性的认知产生负面影响，甚至可能适得其反。

如果项目进度要求必须连续整天进行 HAZOP，那么就需要在整体过程安全方法中考虑到团队成员疲劳以及由此可能导致的 HAZOP 输出质量下降等潜在问题。

HAZOP 团队领导的工作方式可以对会议进展产生重大影响。著名化工安全专家 Trevor Kletz 曾指出，团队领导需要管理以下一系列问题 [2]：

【以下是 Kletz 提到的问题列表】

虽然团队成员有一个共同的目标 —— 建立一个安全可运行的工厂 —— 但他们各自面临的约束条件却不尽相同。设计团队，尤其是负责成本控制的设计工程师，希望尽可能降低成本。而负责调试的经理则希望能够轻松启动工厂。这种利益导向的差异确保了在达成最终决策之前，每个提案的优缺点都能得到充分讨论。然而，如果设计工程师的个性比其他成员强势得多，可能会过度强调经济效益。其他团队则可能犯相反的错误。团队领导的职责就是努力纠正这种失衡。正如 Sir John Harvey-Jones 所言：「在工业领域，最理想的冲突水平并非零。」

导致团队工作中断和危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）效率低下的最常见原因之一是在讨论设计变更上花费过多时间。需要明确的是，HAZOP 并不是一个设计会议。如果解决已识别问题的方案并不明显，团队领导必须迅速引导团队制定行动计划并继续推进 [2]。

专家提示：

如果团队无法达成一致，团队领导应建议在会议之外继续讨论该问题。有时，决策可能会被推迟，以便寻求专家意见（例如，咨询材料专家）或进行进一步研究。在某些情况下，决策也可能被推迟，以便对潜在危险进行定量评估。

HAZOP（以及其他安全研究）中的一个常见问题是行动计划定义不清。例如：

- 一些行动项目仅要求人员「考虑」某个问题，但没有明确的验收标准。这样的项目可能会在没有采取实际行动或给出合理解释的情况下就被关闭；

- 某些行动项目在危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）会议中提出时看似合理，但单独拿出来时却难以理解或含义模糊；

- 还有一些行动项目过于具体，以至于可以通过简单的设计更改就能解决。然而，这种做法可能无法应对更为根本和广泛的问题。

HAZOP 会议产生的行动项目「必须表述得足够清晰，使专业工程师能够理解并执行行动的实质内容，而不仅仅是标题」[15]。有时，在会议期间难以准确地制定措辞。在这种情况下，通常可以接受团队负责人和记录员在会后进行一次总结会议，以确定细节，包括行动项目的具体措辞。这个总结会议应该在 HAZOP 会议结束后尽快进行，任何变更都应及时传达给 HAZOP 团队成员，以便他们提供反馈意见。

注：John Harvey Jones 爵士曾是英国帝国化学工业公司（ICI）的一位富有个性的董事长，后来成为广播员。

总的来说，我们必须认识到危害和可操作性分析（HAZOP）会消耗大量资源。参与 HAZOP 的人员通常还有许多其他工作要处理，比如推进新项目的设计或运营现有设施。尽管 HAZOP 很重要，但不应该因为组织和规划不当而浪费时间。我们可以提前识别出可能导致 HAZOP 过程变得重复的相似节点或区域，然后采取不同的方法来维持团队的兴趣和注意力，确保他们持续保持高度关注并积极参与。

1.2.2 Accidents that may have been avoided by HAZOP

Although HAZOP has been proven to be effective, nevertheless it is reliant on the people involved. Whilst guidewords can prompt them to think about a range of scenarios, if potential hazards are not understood it is possible that some will not be recognized. Having the right people involved in the HAZOP certainly reduces the risks but this cannot be guaranteed.

1.2.2 可能通过 HAZOP 避免的事故

虽然 HAZOP 已被证明是有效的，但它仍然依赖于参与人员的经验和判断。引导词（guidewords）可以提示团队考虑各种可能的情况，但如果对潜在危险缺乏理解，某些风险可能会被忽视。让合适的人参与 HAZOP 无疑可以降低风险，但这并不能完全保证万无一失。

1.2.2.1 Abbeystead

Although included in his chapter about accidents that could have been prevented by HAZOP, Kletz highlights that Abbeystead this would only have been the case if someone in the team had the insight to recognize that methane could be present.

Text Box 1.24

At Abbeystead, water was pumped from one river to another through a tunnel. In an incident in May 1984, when pumping stopped, some water was allowed to drain out of the tunnel leaving a void. Methane from the rocks below accumulated in the void and, when pumping was restarted, was pushed through vent valves into a pump house where it exploded, killing 16 people, most of them local residents who were visiting the plant.

If anyone had realized that methane might be present, the explosion could have been prevented by keeping the tunnel full of water or by discharging the vent valves into the open air. In addition, smoking, the probable cause of ignition, could have been prohibited (though we should not rely on this alone). None of these things were done because no-one realized that methane might be present. Published papers contain references to the presence of dissolved methane in water supplies but these references were not known to the water supply engineers. The knowledge was in the wrong place.

Could a HAZOP have prevented the accident? Only if one of the team knew or suspected that methane might be present. He need not have known the details so long as he could recall the fact from the depths of his memory. Good HAZOP team members are people who have accumulated, by experience and reading, a mental ragbag of bits and pieces of knowledge that may come in useful one day. A HAZOP provides opportunities for the recall of long-forgotten bits of knowledge that might otherwise never pass through the conscious mind again.

1.2.2.1 Abbeystead

事故安全专家 Trevor Kletz 在讨论可能通过 HAZOP 预防的事故时提到了 Abbeystead 事故。然而，他强调，只有当团队中有人具备识别甲烷可能存在的洞察力时，HAZOP 才可能预防这种事故。

案例 1.24

1984 年 5 月，英国兰开夏郡的 Abbeystead 水利工程发生了一起悲剧性事故。该工程的设计目的是通过一条隧道将水从一条河泵入另一条河。在事故发生当天，当泵停止工作时，部分水被排出隧道，形成了一个空腔。随后，来自下方岩层的甲烷（methane）在这个空腔中积聚。当泵重新启动时，积聚的甲烷被推入泵房内，并通过排气阀释放。不幸的是，甲烷在泵房内发生爆炸，导致 16 人丧生，其中大多数是正在参观该设施的当地居民。

事后分析表明，如果工作人员意识到甲烷可能存在，这场悲剧是完全可以避免的。例如，他们可以采取以下预防措施：保持隧道始终充满水，或将排气阀直接排放到户外。此外，禁止在该区域吸烟（虽然这很可能是引发爆炸的原因，但不应该仅仅依赖这一措施）。然而，由于没有人意识到甲烷的潜在存在，这些预防措施都没有被采取。

这起事故揭示了一个严重的知识传播问题。虽然已发表的学术论文中提到了水源中可能存在溶解甲烷，但这些信息并未传达给负责水利工程的工程师。这种情况可以被描述为「知识存在于错误的地方」—— 重要信息没有到达最需要它的人手中。这个案例强调了跨学科知识共享和有效信息传播在工程安全中的重要性。

危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）是否能够预防这起事故呢？这要取决于团队中是否有人知道或怀疑可能存在甲烷。值得注意的是，这个人不需要了解所有细节，只要能从记忆深处唤起这个信息就足够了。优秀的 HAZOP 团队成员通常是那些通过经验积累和广泛阅读，在脑海中储存了大量零散知识的人。这些知识看似杂乱无章，却可能在某一天派上大用场。HAZOP 分析过程为团队成员提供了一个难得的机会，让他们能够回忆起那些被尘封已久的知识碎片，这些知识如果不是在这种场合，可能永远不会重新浮现在他们的意识中。

1.2.2.2 Anhydrous ammonia leak

On 23 August 2010 a release of anhydrous ammonia at the Millard Refrigerated Services facility in Theodore, Alabama resulted in 32 people being admitted to hospital, with four of those requiring intensive care [17]. It happened because pipework failed due to hydraulic shock during the restart of the plant's ammonia refrigeration system following a 7-hour power outage. One of the causes was identified as "the control system contained a programming error that permitted the system to go from soft gas directly to refrigeration mode without bleeding the high pressure from the coil or preventing the low-temperature suction valve from opening. The error with the software logic in the control system went undetected because under normal operations, in its programmed sequence, the defrost cycle would not allow the ammonia liquid to enter the evaporator until the coil was properly depressurized via the bleed cycle."

A HAZOP should have identified that an interruption in the plant's automatic defrost cycle could result in steps occurring out of sequence, some of which would be hazardous. This alone may not have been sufficient to prevent this accident because the cause was a software error. However, the HAZOP may have prevented the accident if the criticality of the software controlled cycle had been fully understood so that it was subject to more scrutiny during its initial programming and any subsequent modification. It is very common, especially for legacy systems, for critical steps to be hidden within software code that is predominantly concerned with normal operations. As a minimum, a functional specification should define all safety critical elements so that they can be actively confirmed as part of initial acceptance tests and during management of change.

1.2.2.2 无水氨泄漏事故

2010 年 8 月 23 日，在美国阿拉巴马州西奥多市的 Millard 制冷服务设施发生了一起严重的无水氨泄漏事故。这起事故导致 32 人入院治疗，其中 4 人情况危急，需要进行重症监护 [17]。事故的起因是在经历了 7 小时的停电之后，工厂重启氨制冷系统时，由于水力冲击导致管道失效。

调查人员发现，造成这次事故的一个重要原因是控制系统中存在一个编程错误。这个错误允许系统从气态氨直接切换到制冷模式，而没有执行必要的安全步骤，如从盘管中排出高压气体或阻止低温吸气阀打开。在正常运行条件下，系统的除霜循环会确保在盘管通过排气循环充分降压之前，不允许液态氨进入蒸发器。然而，由于这个软件逻辑错误，系统跳过了这个重要的安全步骤。更严重的是，这个错误长期未被发现，因为在日常操作中，系统通常会按照正确的程序顺序运行，从而掩盖了这个潜在的危险。

危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）本应识别出，工厂自动化除霜过程的中断可能导致操作步骤顺序混乱，其中某些步骤可能会造成安全隐患。仅仅这一点可能还不足以防止这次事故，因为事故的根本原因是软件错误。然而，如果能充分认识到软件控制循环在整个系统中的关键作用，从而在初始编程和后续任何修改时对其进行更严格的审查，那么 HAZOP 可能就能防止这次事故发生。值得注意的是，特别是在老旧系统中，关键操作步骤往往隐藏在主要用于控制正常运行的软件代码中，这种情况非常普遍。因此，至少应该在功能规范中明确定义所有与安全相关的关键元素，以便在初始验收测试和后续的变更管理过程中能够主动验证这些元素。

1.2.2.3 Heat exchanger rupture caused by High Temperature Hydrogen Attack

In April 2010 a heat exchanger ruptured at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery in Washington State, United States resulting in a fire and explosion. Seven people died [18]. The rupture occurred due to a reduction in the strength of steel caused by High Temperature Hydrogen Attack (HTHA). This occurs at high temperatures when hydrogen is present.

HTHA is a known issue and it is reasonable to expect a HAZOP team to have some awareness. But it only occurs under certain conditions. In this case it was concluded that the exchanger should have operated outside of the region where HTHA was a significant risk, but a HAZOP team member with a more in-depth knowledge may have raised the issue and insisted that the exchanger was subject to postweld heat treatment, which can reduce susceptibility. Also, they may have insisted that active monitoring of the exchanger's operating condition was to be considered critical in order to detect any deviations from the predicted range into a region where HTHA was a risk.

1.2.2.3 由高温氢攻击导致的热交换器破裂事故

2010 年 4 月，美国华盛顿州的德索（Tesoro）阿纳科特斯（Anacortes）炼油厂发生了一起热交换器破裂事故，引发火灾和爆炸，造成 7 人死亡 [18]。这次破裂事故是由高温氢攻击（High Temperature Hydrogen Attack，HTHA）导致钢材强度降低而引起的。高温氢攻击是一种在高温和氢气存在的环境下发生的材料劣化现象。

高温氢攻击（High Temperature Hydrogen Attack，HTHA）是一个众所周知的问题，我们有理由期望危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）团队对此有一定的认识。但是，HTHA 只在特定条件下发生。在这个案例中，结论是换热器应该在 HTHA 不构成重大风险的区域外运行。然而，如果有一位对此有更深入了解的 HAZOP 团队成员，他们可能会提出这个问题，并坚持要求对换热器进行焊后热处理（postweld heat treatment），这可以降低设备对 HTHA 的敏感性。此外，他们可能还会坚持认为，应该将换热器运行状况的主动监测视为关键措施，以便及时发现任何偏离预测范围并进入 HTHA 风险区域的情况。

1.2.3 Harnessing available knowledge

The accidents described previously highlight that HAZOP is most effective if knowledge from a range of sources can be harnessed effectively. Kletz highlighted a number of different examples [2]. The first case is a floating roof tank located in a bund, shown in Fig.1.3.

Fig.1.3 Considering the potential for a hose to leak.

Text Box 1.25

The tank contains oil. Rainwater can be drained from the roof into the bund and from there into the main drainage system. Suppose a HAZOP team is considering whether any substance ‘other than' water can get into the main drainage system. For this to occur there would have to be a hole in the hose, and both valves would have to be left open. An inexperienced team might decide that a triple coincidence is so improbable that there is no need to consider it further. However, someone with knowledge of the practicalities of plant operation would realise that during prolonged rain the operators may leave both drain valves open, whatever the instructions say, to avoid frequent visits to the tank. Any hole in the hose will then contaminate the main drainage system with oil.

Kletz used the following example to emphasise the need for specialised knowledge.

Text Box 1.26

A vessel contained liquid sulphur (melting point 120°C). A HAZOP was carried out on the flowsheet; the team considered ‘more of pressure' and decided that the precautions taken to prevent choking of the vent, which included a lute, were adequate. At a later HAZOP of the line diagram, when considering ‘more of temperature', someone pointed out that the viscosity of sulphur rises sharply above about 200°C. This temperature could not be reached in normal operation but could be reached if the vessel was exposed to fire. The sulphur in the lute could then become so viscous that it would prevent relief of the vessel. The relief system had to be redesigned.

A solvent tank was vented through a seal pot. An electric heater was added later. The reason is not stated in the report, but was presumably to prevent freezing in cold weather. The modification was HAZOPed but all the members of the team were chemical engineers; no electrical engineer or representative of the supplier was present. None of the chemical engineers realised that the temperature of the heater could rise above the auto-ignition temperature of the solvent if the liquid level in seal pot was lost.

Kletz highlighted the importance of local knowledge [2].

Text Box 1.27

During the HAZOP of a batch process the team asked what might be added to the reactor ‘other than' the materials that should be present. The word they actually used was ‘contamination'. Someone pointed out that organic acids could cause a runaway. Further discussion revealed the fact that organic acids were used in another process and were stored in the same warehouse and in the same colour and type of drum as one of the reactants.

Kletz showed how wide-ranging knowledge of what happens including what other people can do can make a big difference in a HAZOP [2].

Text Box 1.28

A plant was fitted with blowdown valves which were operated by high-pressure gas. On a cold day, a leak on the plant caught fire. The operators isolated the feed and tried to blow off the pressure in the plant. The blowdown valves failed to open as there was some water in the impulse lines and it had frozen. As a result the fire continued for longer and caused more damage than it would otherwise have done.

How the water got into the impulse lines was at first a mystery. At a HAZOP 2 years earlier, when the plant was modified, the team were asked if water could get into the impulse lines and they said ‘No'.

Occasionally the valves had to be operated during a shutdown, when no high-pressure gas was available. The maintenance team members were asked to operate the valves but not told how to do so. They used water and a hydraulic pump. None of the HAZOP team members, which included the operator shop steward, knew that the valves had been operated in this way.

HAZOPs are only as good as the knowledge and experience of the people present. If they do not know what goes on, the HAZOP cannot bring out the hazards.

1.2.3 充分利用现有知识

前面描述的事故突出表明，如果能够有效利用来自多个来源的知识，HAZOP 分析会发挥最大效用。Kletz 在其著作中强调了许多不同的例子 [2]。第一个案例是位于防泄漏堤（bund）内的浮顶储罐，如图 1.3 所示。

图 1.3：考虑软管泄漏的可能性。

案例 1.25

储罐内装有油。雨水可以从屋顶排入防护堤，然后从那里流入主排水系统。假设一个危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）团队正在评估是否有除水以外的其他物质可能进入主排水系统。要发生这种情况，需要同时满足三个条件：软管有破损、两个阀门都处于打开状态。缺乏经验的团队可能会认为这种三重巧合的概率极低，因此不值得进一步考虑。然而，熟悉工厂实际运营的人会意识到，在长时间降雨期间，操作员可能会违反操作规程，将两个排水阀都保持打开状态，以避免频繁查看和操作储罐。在这种情况下，如果软管上有任何破损，油就会污染主排水系统。

Kletz 使用以下例子来强调专业知识的重要性。

案例 1.26

一个容器中盛放着液态硫（熔点 120°C）。工程师们对流程图进行了危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP)；在考虑「压力增加」的情况时，团队认为已采取的防止排气管堵塞的预防措施（包括一个液封）是足够的。然而，在后来对详细管线图进行 HAZOP 分析时，当讨论到「温度升高」的情况，有人指出硫的粘度在 200°C 以上会急剧上升。虽然在正常操作中不会达到这个温度，但如果容器暴露在火中就可能达到。这时，液封中的硫可能会变得非常粘稠，以至于阻止容器的泄压。因此，工程师们不得不重新设计泄压系统。

另一个案例中，一个溶剂储罐通过一个密封罐进行排气。后来，工程师们添加了一个电加热器。虽然报告中没有说明原因，但很可能是为了防止在寒冷天气中溶剂冻结。对这一改动进行了 HAZOP 分析，但团队的所有成员都是化学工程师，没有电气工程师或设备供应商代表参与。结果，这些化学工程师都没有意识到一个潜在的危险：如果密封罐中的液位丢失，加热器的温度可能会升高到超过溶剂的自燃点。

Kletz 在其研究中强调了本地知识对于识别潜在危险的重要性 [2]。

案例 1.27

在某些情况下，即使在设备停机（shutdown）期间没有高压气体可用时，也需要操作阀门。维护团队成员被要求操作这些阀门，但却没有得到具体的操作指导。于是，他们采用了水和液压泵来完成操作。令人惊讶的是，包括操作工代表在内的危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）团队成员竟然都不知道阀门是以这种方式被操作的。

这个案例说明，HAZOP 的有效性在很大程度上取决于参与人员的知识和经验。如果他们对实际操作情况不了解，HAZOP 就无法有效识别和评估潜在的危险。

案例 1.28

某工厂安装了一批由高压气体控制的吹除阀 (blowdown valves)。一个寒冷的日子里，工厂出现泄漏并引发火灾。操作人员切断了进料，并试图释放工厂内的压力。然而，吹除阀却无法打开，原因是控制管路中有积水并已结冰。这导致火势持续时间超出预期，造成了更严重的损失。

起初，人们对水如何进入控制管路感到困惑。在两年前工厂改造时进行的危险与可操作性分析 (HAZOP) 中，团队曾被问及水是否可能进入控制管路，他们当时回答「不可能」。

在停车检修期间，有时需要操作这些阀门，但此时没有高压气体可用。维修团队成员被要求操作阀门，但没有得到具体的操作指导。他们便使用水和液压泵来操作阀门。然而，包括操作工工会代表在内的 HAZOP 分析团队成员都不知道阀门曾以这种方式被操作过。

这个案例说明，HAZOP 分析的效果取决于参与人员的知识和经验。如果他们不了解实际操作情况，HAZOP 就无法识别出潜在的危险。

### 1.3 Limitations of HAZOP

Although considered to be one of the best tools available, Kletz pointed out that HAZOP has its limitations [2].

**Text Box 1.29**

HAZOP cannot, of course detect every weakness in design. In particular, it cannot draw attention to weaknesses in layout. It will also miss hazards due to leaks on lines that pass through or close to a unit but carry a material that is not used on that unit. This can be overcome by using an additional guide word such as PASSING THROUGH or NEARBY.

HAZOP assumes that the design assumptions are followed during construction and operation. If, say, the wrong material of construction is used or equipment is not tested as assumed, then problems may arise.

result. HAZOP teams may, of course, draw attention to circumstances where special measures should be taken to ensure that the right materials are used or tests carried out, and may question the wisdom of including equipment such as bypasses around trip valves or isolation valves below relief valves.

Fundamentally HAZOP is limited because it analyses system drawings (e.g. P&ID), which are only a representation of some aspects of the system [15].

1.3 HAZOP 的局限

尽管被认为是最佳可用工具之一，Kletz 还是指出了 HAZOP（危险与可操作性分析）存在一些不足 [2]。

专栏 1.29

HAZOP 无法检测出设计中的所有缺陷。特别是，它难以发现布局方面的问题。此外，对于那些穿过或靠近某个装置，但携带该装置未使用物料的管线，HAZOP 可能会忽视其泄漏带来的危险。为了解决这个问题，可以引入「穿过」或「附近」等额外的分析关键词。

HAZOP 分析基于一个假设，即施工和运行过程都严格遵循设计要求。然而，如果使用了错误的建造材料，或者设备未按计划进行测试，就可能引发问题。

因此，HAZOP 团队通常会特别关注那些需要采取特殊措施的情况，以确保使用正确的材料或进行必要的测试。他们还可能质疑某些设备的合理性，比如安装在跳闸阀周围的旁路系统，或者位于安全阀下方的隔离阀。

HAZOP 的根本局限在于，它分析的是系统图纸（如管道仪表流程图 P&ID），而这些图纸只能反映系统的部分特征 [15]。

1.3.1 Poorly executed HAZOP

1.3.1.1 HAZOP as a design review

Kletz identified a common problem where designers assume problems they encounter can be addressed by a HAZOP [2].

Text Box 1.30

Design engineers have been known to say, when someone suggests a change in design, "Don't bother me now. We'll be having a HAZOP later on. Let's talk about it then."

He points out that this is not the purpose of HAZOP and can result in the assessment being compromised because it is side-tracked into design activities, which means hazards and operability problems can be overlooked [2].

Text Box 1.31

This is the wrong approach. A HAZOP is a final check on a basically sound design to make sure that no unforeseen effects have been overlooked. It should not replace the normal consultations and discussions that take place while a design is being developed. A HAZOP meeting is not the right place for redesigning the plant; there are too many people present and it distracts from the main purpose of the meeting which is the critical examination of the design on the table.

1.3.1 HAZOP 实施中的常见问题

1.3.1.1 将 HAZOP 误用为设计审查

Kletz 发现了一个普遍存在的问题：设计师往往过分依赖 HAZOP，认为它能解决设计过程中遇到的所有问题 [2]。

专栏 1.30

当有人提出设计变更建议时，设计工程师们可能会说：「现在别打扰我。我们之后会进行 HAZOP（危险与可操作性分析）。到时候再讨论吧。」

然而，有专家指出，这并非 HAZOP 的本意。这种做法可能会影响评估的质量，因为它将重点错误地转移到了设计活动上，从而可能导致忽视了潜在的危险和操作问题 [2]。

文本框 1.31：

正确的 HAZOP 应用方法上述做法是不正确的。HAZOP 应该是对一个基本完善的设计进行最后的检查，目的是确保没有遗漏任何未预见的影响。它不应该取代设计开发过程中的日常咨询和讨论。HAZOP 会议不适合重新设计工厂，原因有二：首先，参与的人员过多；其次，这会分散会议的主要目的，即对现有设计进行系统的安全性和可操作性评估。

1.3.1.2 HAZOP completed too late

A fairly common problem is that HAZOP is done too late in a project. This means that people are reluctant to get involved because they know that if they do identify any problems with the design they will be very difficult and expensive to rectify. This arises when the project is not well managed or the value of HAZOP is not recognised. The study happens because it is a key deliverable that has to be done but gets left to the last minute.

The problem with a late HAZOP is that recommendations for improvements will be mainly restricted to add-on safety protection systems rather than implementing inherently safer solutions. The result is that the hazards remain but the plant complexity is potentially increased due to all the devices being added [19].





1.3.1.3 Short cutting the process

One of the significant challenges for HAZOP is the resources required. It is inevitable that people will try to modify their approach to reduce this burden.

Kletz identified one example where this was done [2].

**Text Box 1.32**

One company has tried to simplify HAZOP by just looking for deviations from its design codes and standards. This may be OK if there is little or no innovation but if there is innovation—and there usually is some—the existing codes may not cover the new circumstances. For example, a hydraulic crane tried to lift a load that was too heavy for the fully extended jib and fell onto the plant: no alarm sounded. The crane was fitted with all the alarms required by the current codes and they were all in working order. However, the codes were written for mechanical strut cranes. Hydraulic cranes have an extra degree of freedom—the length of the jib can be changed—and therefore an extra alarm is needed, but no one had realised this.

One way of short cutting the process is to minimise the amount of analysis conducted in the meeting or workshop. People justify this by saying that their designers are highly competent in both design and HAZOP, and so will have already completed a thorough analysis themselves as they went along. Taken to an extreme this philosophy can lead to a view that HAZOP is not required at all. This is something that Kletz discussed [2].

**Text Box 1.33**

‘We don't need a HAZOP. We employ good people and rely on their knowledge and experience'.

A HAZOP is not a substitute for knowledge and experience. It is not a sausage machine which consumes line diagrams and produces lists of modifications. It merely harnesses the knowledge and experience of the team in a systematic and concerted way. Because designs are so complicated the team members cannot apply their knowledge and experience without this crutch for their thinking. If the team lacks knowledge and experience the HAZOP will produce nothing worthwhile.

‘Good People' sometimes work in isolation. Pegram writes, "working independently, the solving of a problem by one discipline can become a problem of another" and "low cost engineering solutions from one point of view may not necessarily end up as overall low cost." HAZOP ensures that hazards and operating problems are considered systematically by people from different functions working together. Experience shows that start-up, shutdown and other abnormal conditions are often overlooked by functional groups working in isolation.

The opposite of the heading to this section is the belief that good systems can be a substitute for good people. All that systems can do, however, is to ensure that people's knowledge and experience are applied systematically and thus reduce the chance that something is missed. If people lack knowledge or experience (or commitment) then systems such as HAZOP are empty shells. People will go through the motions but the output will be poor. Good people without a system will achieve less than their full potential, but if people lack knowledge and experience the systems will achieve nothing.

In fact, one flip side of involving knowledgeable and experienced people in HAZOP is that they can provide convincing arguments to say an issue is not a major concern because they have seen it happen and the consequences were not significant. In this case the experience is helping to keep the HAZOP moving along at a good pace but introduces the potential for things to be missed, particularly the low-frequency, high-consequence events. Another way that this can happen is if the team get fixated on one or two major hazards, because then they can start to perceive that lesser ones are not worth discussing. But as we know most accidents occur due to a combination of multiple, relatively minor issues and not just one very large one in isolation.

1.3.2 Inappropriate safeguards

It is tempting in a HAZOP to identify a range of existing items as Safeguards or to propose additional items without taking account of what they can reasonably achieve in practice. For example:

- Local instruments which are never checked by field operators and, therefore, could in no way be considered safeguards;

- Alarms which give the operator insufficient time to effectively halt the deviation, because the rate of upset is too fast. Also, alarms that are too generic, activated frequently, or would occur as part of a flood of alarms in the scenario being considered;

- Pressure relief systems for which there is no guarantee that they were designed for the case being studied; and

- Operating procedures, when the cause giving rise to the scenario is human error.

1.3.2.1 Over reliance on people

As with all things in life it is necessary to take a balanced approach to HAZOP, particularly when deciding what safeguards are required and which are not because they would not add additional benefit. When making these decisions it is important to recognise the ability of the people involved in operating the system, but to be realistic about their capabilities and reliability. This can be particularly difficult if experienced operators are involved in the process, if they become protective of their role, as they are likely to find it difficult to believe that they or their colleagues will make the errors that would result in the deviations being discussed. This is often a wider cultural issue caused by operators being unfairly blamed for incidents and other problems experienced. Kletz pointed out that human errors must be considered fully.

Text Box 1.34

Human error should also always be considered as a possible cause of deviations. Thus no flow may be due to someone failing to open a valve. This can occur for a number of reasons.

The operator may not have known the valve should have been opened; the intention was wrong.

We may have to improve training and instructions or simplify the job.

The operator may have decided that it was unnecessary to open the valve at that time or that other tasks were more urgent. We may have to explain the reasons for instructions and make sure they are followed.

The valve may have been too stiff or out of reach. Most likely of all, there may have been a slip or lapse of attention, the intention was correct but was not fulfilled. Everyone has slips and lapses of attention from time to time and they cannot be prevented, though various actions may make them less likely. If the consequences are serious, we should remove or reduce the opportunities for error by changing the design or method of working (or protect people from the consequences or make recovery possible).

There are two fairly common problems that result from a lack of understanding of human factors when carrying out a HAZOP:

- Discounting deviations because it is assumed that competent people who follow procedures will not make errors; and

- Identifying procedures as effective safeguards without specifying exactly what procedure is required and what content is required to ensure that the safeguard is effective.

Although it is possible to take some credit for procedures in a HAZOP the focus must remain on finding design solutions. The HAZOP team have no control over what procedures are provided when the system is operational or the competence of the people who operate, maintain, and manage it.

1.3.2.2 Unrealistic expectations of automated systems

A very common outcome from a HAZOP is a recommendation to include additional trips or Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in the design. Kletz said that this occurs because the HAZOP team perceives this to be a cheap and effective solution, but he pointed out that this was not the case.

Many are solved that way but not as cheaply as we usually think. Testing and maintaining an extra trip costs about as much as purchase and installation, even after discounting. Trips cost twice what we think. In addition, a considerable management effort is needed to make sure that the testing is carried out. Procedures can corrode faster than steel and vanish without trace once managers lose interest. Instead of installing extra trips, it is better to carry out systematic studies earlier in design to find ways of avoiding the hazards.

Another problem is that people assume that automated systems don't fail. Kletz pointed out that this is not correct.

Always consider the failure of automatic equipment as a possible cause of the deviations. For example, no flow may be due to a trip or controller failing to open a valve or closing it at the wrong time.

In fact he recommended that any software used as control needs to be subject to HAZOP [2].

**Text Box 1.37**

On the contrary, it is vital to HAZOP the instructions given to the computer (the applications software) as, unlike operators, the computer cannot recognise and query instructions that are ambiguous, lack precision or are simply wrong. Also, software engineers are rarely also chemical engineers and can easily misunderstand the chemical engineer's requirements.

Another very common issue is that alarms are often specified as safeguards in a HAZOP. This has, in part, contributed to a very serious problem in many industries including process, where alarm systems fail in their key objectives. This is because operators receive far too many nuisance alarms that do not require a response and are overwhelmed by floods of alarms that they have no chance of understanding whenever a system experiences a malfunction or upset. Many companies have identified this issue and are working hard to resolve it [9]. This often includes deletion or modifications to alarms. This can mean that assumptions made during the HAZOP are no longer valid and may call into question the underlying basis of the safeguards assumed in the study.

**1.3.2.3 Overlooking knock-on effects**

To be effective a HAZOP must not only identify issues, but it also should involve some consideration of potential solutions. However, there is a balance to strike because there is unlikely to be sufficient time to fully evaluate any proposed design change. Kletz identified that a failure to consider potential knock-on effects is one particular concern [2].

**Text Box 1.38**

When a change in design (or operating conditions) is made during a HAZOP, it may have effects elsewhere in the plant, including the sections already studied.

For example, during a HAZOP the team decided to connect an alternative cooling water supply to a heat exchanger. The original water supply was clean but the alternative was contaminated, and so the team had to change the grade of steel used for the heat exchanger and connecting lines. It also had to consider the effects of reverse flow in the original lines.

The way actions are worded can have a significant effect on how they are implemented. If they are too prescriptive it is possible that they are implemented without anyone taking the time to fully evaluate the intended and unintended consequences. However, high-level actions to ‘consider' a change are often closed quickly by someone saying that they have considered the issue and decided that no change was required.

**1.3.3 Lack of follow-up**

Of course a HAZOP does nothing on its own to improve safety. It is the actions that result that have this effect.

It is always reasonable for actions from HAZOP (or any study) to be rejected but they should not be ignored. In most cases, a rejection should be justified because another action is identified that can be demonstrated to be more effective. Whilst rejecting an action and doing nothing may be acceptable it should be clearly explained why the risks are considered to be acceptable and ALARP. "It is worse for the company to have a HAZOP and ignore the recommendations than to not have a HAZOP at all" [15].

One practice to be particularly aware of is for actions to be postponed to a later stage in the project [15]. This results in the original action being closed because the people currently involved in the project feel that they are unable to implement a solution. Such an action should only be closed if it has been transferred to another system (e.g. risk register) to ensure that it receives the proper attention at a later time. Alternatively, the action should be ‘deferred' with details for when it needs to be addressed.

One problem with making HAZOP a mandatory activity, either as part of a project or as a planned retrospective review, is that it can become perceived as a ‘tick-box exercise' that people think needs to be done quickly and easily, with the aim of discovering as few issues as possible. This can be partly avoided by ensuring that clear procedures are in place that describe how the HAZOP has to be performed but its importance still needs to be emphasised. Making a senior manager responsible for the final ‘sign off' of the HAZOP report will focus their attention [14]. The responsibility in this regard is to confirm that all actions have been cleared or formally accepted as exceptions and that the HAZOP process has been carried out according to company guidelines by competent people.

1.3.4 Accidents that probably would not have been avoided by HAZOP

Kletz was quite clear that HAZOP cannot prevent every accident [2].

Text Box 1.39

They will not for at least three reasons: (a) Being human, we will not spot everything that might go wrong; (b) People will not always act in the way we have assumed they will; and (c) HAZOP cannot, by its nature, prevent mechanical accidents, such as people bumping into equipment which has been badly located.

Kletz highlighted that the HAZOP team have to assume that a system will be operated and maintained correctly [2].

Text Box 1.40

They assume that the general level of management is competent, that the plant will be operated and maintained in the manner assumed by the design team and in accordance with good management and engineering practice. In particular they assume that protective systems will be tested regularly and repaired promptly when necessary.

If these assumptions are not true then HAZOPs are a waste of time. It is no use identifying hazards or estimating their probability if no-one wants to do anything about them; it is no use installing trip and alarms if no-one is going to use or maintain them. The time spent on HAZOP would be better spent on bringing the safety consciousness of employees and management up to standard.

1.3.4.1 Piper Alpha

The tragedy at Piper Alpha that resulted in the death of 167 people when the offshore oil platform caught fire occurred because hydrocarbon leaked from the location where a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) had been removed for maintenance. Whilst a HAZOP would have identified the PSV as a safeguard against overpressurisation of pipework it would have assumed that it would always be in place whenever hydrocarbon was present.

At its simplest level Piper Alpha occurred due to a leak of hydrocarbon from a pipework joint. It did not particularly matter which joint leaked. The fundamental failures were due to poor management of maintenance and isolations. Whilst HAZOP can highlight the importance of these processes at a general level it cannot consider specific scenarios.

Nonetheless, had a HAZOP been performed on Piper Alpha, it may have identified the need for a HAZOP action to consider ways to mitigate the potential consequences of a vapour cloud explosion, as explained by Kletz as follows [12].

Text Box 1.1

The overpressure from the explosion in the condensate area blew down the fire wall separating it from the section of plant containing equipment to extract crude oil. Containment was breached and there was an immediate and large oil fire. It was that fire and the resultant engulfing of the platform in thick smoke which hampered attempts to escape.

Evidently, in the design stage of the platform, it had been judged that a fire could occur due to a loss of containment in the condensate section. The probability of that happening was sufficiently likely that fire walls were installed between the various sections of the unit. It is difficult to imagine that, in the light of that assessment, an explosion in the condensate area was less likely. Nevertheless, Piper Alpha had no explosion walls either side of the condensate area. However, the more crucial deficiency was that, at the design stage, there had not been a systematic and, where necessary, quantified assessment of the major hazards which could occur on the platform. No hazard and operability review had been made of the design.

1.3.4.2 Buncefield

The fire and explosion at the Buncefield oil storage depot occurred because a tank used to store gasoline was overfilled. This occurred due to operational errors but level instrumentation that would have triggered an alarm when the tank reached a certain level was not functional. A HAZOP would have identified a high level alarm as a safeguard against this accident, and it would have been a reasonable outcome of the study. But the HAZOP team have to assume that, once fitted, the instrumentation would have been maintained in an operational condition. The study could have been used to highlight the importance of the safeguard, but again this could only be at a general level because it would apply to a wide range of instrumentation associated with alarms and trips.

Other types of study such as LOPA may have provided a better insight into the adequacy of instrumentation that only could have caused an alarm without any trip function, but this would still assume that all devices were maintained appropriately.

Alternatively, an inherently safer design study may have identified options to eliminate the potential for the huge vapour cloud explosions by considering alternative options higher.

on the hierarchy of risk reduction techniques, rather than relying on additional layer of protection like level switches and valves which are all prone to failure. The consideration of inherently safer design at Buncefield is included in the Inherent Safety section of this book.

1.4 Practical application

The purpose of this chapter has been to share a range of viewpoints of HAZOP based on what Kletz wrote about and more recent experience by others. This final section provides some additional practical guidance for anyone who may be organising or taking part in a study.

1.4.1 The how and when of HAZOP

Performing a HAZOP requires a fair degree of planning and organisation. Kletz gave us some real insight into some of the issues that need to be addressed in doing this.

1.4.1.1 Involve the right people

Kletz pointed out that HAZOP does not have magical properties and it totally relies on the involvement of people.

Text Box 1.42

Techniques discover nothing; only people discover hazards; techniques can help them do so. HAZOP helps people apply their knowledge and experience, and much of that comes from learning and remembering the lessons of the past.

Kletz discussed whether a HAZOP team should remain the same throughout a study. His view was that changes could occur, especially during longer studies as this would avoid too much HAZOP fatigue. Also, allowing different people to attend meant that the level of understanding and insight into the design, hazards, and potential operational issues would be distributed more widely through a team, which can be beneficial.

Kletz identified that some issues require expert input from people who may not be required to attend a HAZOP for the whole time.

Text Box 1.43

On the contrary, if a plant has specific problems (for example, if corrosion is serious), an expert in these problems should join the team. But do not have experts sitting in the meeting just in case their advice is needed.

Experts can always be on-call. The wide availability of tele- and video conferencing facilities means that they do not need to be local to have an input.

1.4 Practical application

1.4.1.2 Don't leave it to contractors

One concern is for projects where the bulk of the design is performed by third parties. Often the completion of a HAZOP is part of their contract and that can lead to the impression that they should do this alone. Kletz highlighted that this would not be a good idea [2].

Text Box 1.44

Companies have been known to say to a design contractor, "We are under-staffed and you are the experts, so why don't you do the HAZOP for us?"

The client should be involved as well as the contractor because the client will have to operate the plant. The HAZOP gives the client's staff an understanding of the reasons for various design features and helps them write the operating instructions. Even if the client's staff know little to start with about the problems specific to the particular process, they will be able to apply general chemical engineering and scientific knowledge as well as common sense knowledge. Writing in a different context, Pegram says, "... The only effective team is one that owns the problem. The team must therefore comprise the individuals who are responsible for implementing the results of the study, not an external group of experts." The actions agreed at a HAZOP include changes in procedures as well as changes to equipment and, while the contractor is responsible for the latter, the client is responsible for the former.

1.4.1.3 Getting started

Some people feel that they do not need to do HAZOP because they only ever carry out small projects where they (incorrectly) feel that it does not apply. Not only does this mean that the small projects are not given the scrutiny which they require, but it can mean that the company and people are not prepared when a large project comes along. Kletz summed up his views on this [2].

Text Box 1.45

On the contrary, we should start small by applying HAZOP to one or two projects and see if we find it useful. If we do, we can gradually increase our effort until we are HAZOPing all new plants and as many old ones as resources allow.

1.4.1.4 Plant modifications should be HAZOPed

Kletz had concerns that people sometimes feel HAZOP is only intended for new projects and so does not get used for modifications. He summed up his main concern as follows [2].

Text Box 1.46

A modification that has not been thoroughly thought through can result in a chain of further modifications during the subsequent months, possibly in distant parts of the plant.

N. Pegram. The Chemical Engineer Number 482. 1990.

He gave the following further explanation [2].

**Text Box 1.47**

Many people believe that HAZOP is unsuitable for small modifications because it is difficult to assemble a team every time we wish to install a new valve or sample point or raise the operating temperature. However, many accidents have occurred because modifications had unforeseen and unpleasant side-effects. If proposals are not ‘HAZOPed', therefore, they should still be thoroughly probed before they are authorised.

Do not overlook the following modifications:

- Temporary modifications as well as permanent ones;

- Start-up modifications as well as those on established plants;

- Cheap modifications as well as expensive ones; and

- Modifications to procedures, process materials or operating conditions, as well as modifications to equipment.

The requirement to consider a HAZOP should be integral in any Management of Change procedure. It should be very clear in which circumstances it should be mandatory, recommended, or not required.

1.4.1.5 **‘Reasonably practicable' applies**

One concern is that companies are obliged to implement actions arising from HAZOP, even if they are very expensive. Kletz said this was not necessarily the case [2].

**Text Box 1.48**

HAZOP uncovers problems and ways of removing them. If the problems are very expensive to remove and the risks are not intolerable (in the legal phrase, if removing them is not ‘reasonably practicable'), we do not have to remove them. But it is wrong to close our eyes in case we do not like what we see.

What is clear is that making a case for ALARP requires far more than simply rejecting an action because it is expensive. Any rejection of an action should have a fully documented justification, primarily focused on why the risk reduction achieved is not considered sufficient. Ideally, an alternative action should be proposed that addresses the issue raised in the HAZOP and which is more effective and/or less expensive.

1.4.1.6 **Automated HAZOP**

Software for recording HAZOP inputs and outputs is now ubiquitous, but people would like to take this further. Automating the HAZOP process has been researched by a number of groups for many years, but none have succeeded in developing a usable system, perhaps because computers cannot replace the imagination and judgement of a knowledgeable and experienced team. Kletz had some involvement in this and shared his views [2].

Text Box 1.49

Computers are now widely used for recording results and reminding teams of common causes of deviations. Programmes have also been developed, but so far little used, for producing a list of technical problems for consideration. A computer is highly unlikely to be able to identify the problems that arise out of interactions, or failures to interact, between people.

1.4.1.7 Other types of HAZOP

It has been stated that HAZOP is only one method of many that can be used for hazard identification studies. There are some variations on the method that have been developed for specific purposes. Some of the more well known include:

- Batch HAZOP, for batch processes, where the guidewords should be augmented to include phrases such as ‘early', ‘late', ‘before', ‘after', etc.;

- Human or procedures HAZOP—focussed on human errors, their consequences and controls; and

- Software or control HAZOP (CHAZOP)—identification of weaknesses and errors in software.

Studies using these methods can follow very similar approaches taken to standard HAZOP, but will require team leaders and/or team members with the appropriate subject knowledge.

1.4.2 Specific pointers for process HAZOP

Kletz provided us with a lot of things to look out for when carrying out HAZOP in the process industry.

1.4.2.1 HAZOP for vessels

Kletz suggested that vessels sometimes need special consideration during HAZOP [2].

Text Box 1.50

When all the lines leading into a vessel have been studied, the guide word OTHER THAN is applied to the vessel. It is not essential to apply the other guide words to this item as any problems should come to light when the inlet and exit lines are studied. However, to reduce the chance that something is missed, the guide words should be applied to any operation carried out in the vessel. For example, if settling takes place we ask if it is possible to have no settling, reverse settling (that is, mixing), more settling or less settling, and similarly for stirring, heating, cooling and any other operations.

1.4.2.2 Intermediate storage

Kletz's focus on inherent safety led to him saying that "you should have grey hairs, not intermediate storage." Nevertheless, it is often required and it should receive special attention during a HAZOP [2].

1. Hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis

**Text Box 1.51**

Pay special attention to intermediate storage vessels. As a rule, no change is supposed to take place there except emptying or filling but changes in temperature or composition may take place, particularly when the contents are allowed to stand for longer than usual.

1.4.2.3 Small branches

Kletz highlighted the potential for HAZOPs to focus on larger items, which sometimes means that apparently less significant items such as small branches can be missed [2].

**Text Box 1.52**

Do not overlook small branches which may not have been given a line number. For example, a tank was fitted with a tundish so that it could be dosed with stabilising chemicals. The effects of adding too much or too little additive (or the wrong additive, or adding it at the wrong time) should obviously be considered during HAZOP but might be overlooked if the team studied only lines with line numbers. (On the other hand, they might have picked it up by considering operations taking place inside a vessel, another example of the way in which HAZOP often gives us a second chance.)

1.4.2.4 Ask about design features

Kletz suggested that the HAZOP was a good time to ask about a range of design features that are not always directly associated with the process [2].

**Text Box 1.53**

The HAZOP also provides an opportunity to check that a number of detailed points have been considered during design. The team should ask:

- What types of gasket have been used? Should spiral wound ones be used? Has the number of types been kept to a minimum? (The more types we use, the greater the chance that the wrong sort will be used.)

- Has the number of types of nuts and bolts, been kept to a minimum?

- Are the valves used of a type, such as rising spindle valves, whose position can be seen at a glance?

- If ball valves or cocks are used, can the handles be fitted in the wrong position?

- Are spectacle plates installed whenever regular slip-plating (blinding) of a joint (for maintenance or to prevent contamination) is foreseen?

- Access is normally considered later in design, when a model of the plant (real or on computer) is available, but the HAZOP team should note any points that need special attention, for example valves that will have to be operated frequently or in an emergency, and should therefore be easy to reach.

1.4.3 Summing up

Kletz shared the following about the potential power of HAZOP [2].

**Text Box 1.54**

Carling has described the effects of using HAZOP in his company. The benefits went far beyond a simple list of recommendations for a safer plant. The interaction between team members brought about a profound change in individual and departmental attitudes. Staff began to seek one another out to discuss possible consequences of proposed changes, problems were discussed more openly, departmental rivalries and barriers receded. The dangers of working in isolation and the consequences of ill-judged and hasty actions became better appreciated. Knowledge, ideas and experience became shared more fully to the benefit of the individual and the company.

Carling's company adopted HAZOP after experiencing several serious incidents. Buzzelli writes: "For an industry so proud of its technical safety achievement, it is humbling to have to admit that most of our significant safety improvements were developed in response to plant accidents."

It does not have to be so. HAZOP provides us with a lantern on the bow, a way of seeing hazards before they wreck our ship.

A publication that reviewed 40 different methods of hazard identification summarised the advantages of HAZOP as follows.

- It is a systematic and comprehensive technique. A detailed plan for performing the technique is available which systematically applies guidewords and parameters to all the pipes and vessels in the process.

- It examines the consequences of the failure. Thought should be given by the assessment team to the consequences of the deviations identified. This aids in the production of recommendations for methods to minimise or mitigate the hazard.

The same study summarised the disadvantages of HAZOP as follows.

- It is time consuming and expensive. Most plants contain a large number of pipes and vessels each of which need to be examined by the application of the various guidewords and parameters.

- It requires detailed design drawing to perform the full study. To fully perform the study the process has to be designed to such a level that all the pipes and vessels are detailed with their operating conditions and control instrumentation.

- Additional guidewords are required for unusual hazards. For specific dangers that will not be covered by the general guidewords, further words (such as radiation for the nuclear industry) will need to be applied.

- It requires experienced practitioners. Experienced team members are required to identify all possible causes and consequences of the deviations, as well as producing realistic recommendations.

- It focuses on one-event causes of deviation only. Only the hazards associated with single deviations can be studied. Hazards that are caused by two or more separate deviations cannot be identified by the technique.

Another study [13] concluded that HAZOP is very beneficial at assuring the ‘conception, configuration and specification' of a system, which leads to improvements in specifications for fabrication, commissioning, operating, and maintaining the plant. But it has many side benefits, including serving as a source of reference for aiding decisions during the system's life, particularly when making modifications and for educating the people involved in a way that helps to improve future design and eliminate cross-discipline conflicts.

HAZOP conducted at design provides the opportunity to avoid high probability, low-consequence events, whilst also ensuring suitable protection is in place against the low-probability, high-consequence events. HAZOPs conducted retrospectively have the advantage of experience that gives a greater insight into problems and the likelihood of escalation into incidents and possibly accidents [13].

HAZOP is one of the few methods for which formal guidance exists. It should not be seen as the only option for identifying hazards, with the chosen method depending on the application and available resources [9].

1.3.1.2 危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）完成时间过晚一个常见问题是 HAZOP 在项目中进行得太晚。这导致人们不愿参与，因为他们明白：即使发现设计问题，此时再进行修正也将非常困难且成本高昂。这种情况通常出现在项目管理不善或未充分认识 HAZOP 价值的情况下。虽然 HAZOP 是必须完成的关键 deliverable，但常常被拖延到最后一刻才开始进行。

HAZOP 进行得太晚的问题在于，改进建议往往局限于增加额外的安全保护系统，而非实施本质上更安全的解决方案（如从设计层面消除潜在危险）。结果是，原有的危害依然存在，而由于添加了众多设备，反而可能增加了工厂的复杂度 [19]。

1.3.1.3 简化流程

HAZOP 面临的主要挑战之一是所需资源量大。因此，人们往往会尝试调整方法以减轻这一负担。

Kletz 曾举例说明这种做法 [2]。

Text Box 1.32

有一家公司试图通过仅关注设计规范和标准的偏差来简化危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）。如果项目中几乎没有创新，这种做法可能是可以接受的。但如果存在创新 —— 而通常都会有一些创新 —— 现有的规范可能无法涵盖新出现的情况。举个例子，有一次一台液压起重机试图吊起一个对于完全伸展的吊臂来说过重的负载，结果整个起重机倒在了工厂上，但没有任何警报响起。这台起重机装配了当前规范要求的所有警报器，而且它们都处于正常工作状态。然而，这些规范最初是为机械式起重机制定的。液压起重机多了一个可变因素 —— 吊臂的长度可以改变 —— 因此需要增加一个额外的警报，但当时没有人意识到这一点。

有些人试图通过减少在会议或研讨会上进行的分析来简化 HAZOP 流程。他们为此辩解说，他们的设计师在设计和 HAZOP 方面都非常有能力，因此在工作过程中已经完成了彻底的分析。如果将这种观点推到极端，可能会导致认为根本不需要进行 HAZOP。这个问题曾被 Kletz 讨论过 [2]。

插文 1.33

"我们不需要 HAZOP。我们雇佣的都是优秀人才，我们相信他们的知识和经验。"

危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）并不能替代知识和经验。它不是一个简单的自动化工具，不能仅靠输入线路图就生成修改清单。相反，HAZOP 是一种系统化和协调的方法，用于充分利用团队的知识和经验。由于现代设计变得越来越复杂，团队成员如果没有这种思维辅助工具，就难以有效地运用他们的知识和经验。因此，如果团队缺乏必要的知识和经验，即使进行 HAZOP 分析也难以产生有价值的结果。

有时候，即使是「优秀的人才」也可能陷入单独工作的困境。正如 Pegram 所言："当各个学科独立工作时，一个领域解决的问题可能会成为另一个领域的麻烦」，他还指出，"从单一角度看似成本较低的工程解决方案，最终可能并不是整体上最经济的选择。」HAZOP 的优势在于它能确保来自不同职能部门的人员共同系统地考虑潜在危险和操作问题。实践经验表明，当各个功能部门单独工作时，往往会忽视启动、关闭以及其他异常情况的考虑。

本节讨论的是一个普遍存在的误解：认为优秀的系统可以取代优秀的人才。然而，系统的作用仅限于确保人们的知识和经验得到系统性的应用，从而降低遗漏重要信息的可能性。如果参与者缺乏必要的知识、经验或投入，那么像危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）这样的系统就会沦为空壳。人们可能会按部就班地完成流程，但产出的质量必然低劣。反之，即使是优秀的人才，如果没有系统的辅助，也难以充分发挥其潜力。但若参与者本身就缺乏必要的知识和经验，再好的系统也无法产生有价值的成果。

有趣的是，让知识渊博、经验丰富的专家参与 HAZOP 也可能带来意想不到的问题。这些专家可能会基于自身经历，convincingly 地论证某些问题并不需要太多关注，因为他们曾亲眼目睹类似情况，而结果并不严重。这种经验虽然有助于保持 HAZOP 进程的流畅性，但也可能导致某些问题被忽视，尤其是那些发生频率低但后果严重的事件。另一种可能出现的情况是，如果团队过度关注一两个主要危害，他们可能会开始认为其他相对较小的危害不值得讨论。然而，我们知道大多数事故并非由单一的重大问题引起，而是多个相对较小的问题叠加的结果。

1.3.2 安全防护不当

在进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）时，人们很容易将一系列现有项目识别为保障措施，或提出额外的措施，而不考虑这些措施在实际操作中能够合理达到的效果。例如：

- 现场操作人员从未检查的现场仪表，这些仪表实际上根本不能被视为保障措施；

- 由于故障发生速度太快，无法给操作员留出足够时间有效阻止偏差的警报。此外，还包括那些过于笼统、频繁触发，或在所考虑的情景中会成为警报洪流一部分的警报；

- 无法保证是为所研究情况而设计的压力泄放系统；以及

- 操作程序，特别是在导致某种情景发生的原因本身就是人为错误的情况下。

1.3.2.1 过度依赖人员

与生活中的所有事物一样，对危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）采取平衡的方法是必要的，特别是在决定哪些安全措施是必需的，以及哪些因不能带来额外收益而可以省略时。在做出这些决定时，重要的是要认识到系统操作人员的能力，但同时也要对他们的能力和可靠性保持客观态度。如果有经验丰富的操作员参与这个过程，这可能会特别困难，因为如果他们对自己的职责产生了过度的保护意识，他们可能很难相信自己或同事会犯下导致正在讨论的异常情况的错误。这通常反映了一个更广泛的组织文化问题，源于操作员在事故和其他问题发生时被不公平地归咎。Kletz 指出，必须充分考虑人为错误的因素。

表 1.34

在考虑可能导致异常情况的原因时，也应该始终将人为错误纳入考虑范围。例如，流量为零可能是由于某人没有打开阀门造成的。这可能由多个原因引起：

操作员可能不知道应该打开阀门，也就是说，其操作意图本身就是错误的。

在这种情况下，我们可能需要改进培训和操作指令，或者简化工作流程。

操作员可能认为当时没有必要打开阀门，或者其他任务更为紧急。针对这种情况，我们可能需要解释操作指令背后的原因，并确保这些指令得到严格执行。

阀门可能过于坚硬或位置难以触及。更有可能的是，操作者可能出现了一时的疏忽或注意力分散，虽然操作意图正确，但未能完成预期目标。人人都难免会有疏忽和走神的时候，这些是无法完全避免的，尽管我们可以采取各种措施来降低其发生的可能性。如果潜在后果十分严重，我们应该通过优化设计或改进工作方法来消除或减少错误发生的机会（或者保护人员免受不良后果的影响，或使系统能够从错误中恢复）。

在进行危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）时，由于缺乏对人为因素的深入理解，常常会出现两个问题：

- 错误地认为只要是有能力的人员严格遵守操作程序就不会犯错，从而忽视了可能的偏差；

- 将操作程序笼统地视为有效的安全保障，但未能具体说明需要什么样的程序，以及这些程序应包含哪些内容才能确保其有效性。

尽管在 HAZOP 分析中可以在一定程度上考虑操作程序的作用，但分析的重点必须始终放在寻找设计层面的解决方案上。这是因为 HAZOP 团队无法掌控系统实际运行时会采用什么样的程序，也无法决定负责操作、维护和管理系统的人员的实际能力水平。

1.3.2.2 警惕对自动化系统的过度乐观

危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）的一个非常常见的建议是在设计中增加额外的安全联锁或安全仪表系统（Safety Instrumented Systems，SIS）。Kletz 指出，HAZOP 团队之所以会提出这样的建议，是因为他们认为这是一种既便宜又有效的解决方案。然而，他强调事实并非如此简单。

虽然很多问题确实可以通过这种方式解决，但成本往往比我们想象的要高得多。即使考虑了价格优惠，测试和维护一个额外的安全联锁系统的成本也差不多等于购买和安装的费用。换句话说，安全联锁系统的实际成本可能是我们预期的两倍。更重要的是，确保这些测试得到切实执行还需要大量的管理工作。一旦管理层对此失去兴趣，相关的操作程序可能会比金属老化得更快，甚至会悄无声息地消失。因此，与其安装额外的安全联锁系统，不如在设计的早期阶段就进行系统性的研究，找出避免潜在危险的方法。

另一个常见的误区是人们倾向于认为自动化系统是万无一失的。Kletz 指出这种想法是错误的。

他强调，在分析可能的异常情况时，我们必须考虑到自动设备故障的可能性。例如，如果发现没有物料流动，原因可能是安全联锁系统触发了，或者是控制器没能正常打开阀门，又或者是在错误的时间关闭了阀门。

事实上，Kletz 建议，任何用于控制的软件都应该接受 HAZOP 分析 [2]。

图 1.37：HAZOP 分析中的常见误区

相反，对给予计算机的指令（即应用软件）进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）是至关重要的。这是因为与人类操作员不同，计算机无法识别和质疑那些模糊不清、缺乏精确性或完全错误的指令。此外，软件工程师很少同时具备化学工程背景，因此很容易误解化学工程师的需求。

另一个非常普遍的问题是，在 HAZOP 分析中经常将报警系统指定为安全措施。这在一定程度上导致了包括过程工业在内的许多行业出现了一个非常严重的问题：报警系统未能实现其关键目标。造成这种情况的原因是操作员常常收到大量不需要响应的干扰报警，而且每当系统出现故障或异常时，他们就会被铺天盖地的报警信息淹没，根本无法理解和处理。许多公司已经意识到这个问题，并正在努力解决它 [9]。解决方案通常包括删除或修改某些报警设置。然而，这可能意味着在 HAZOP 分析期间做出的假设不再有效，甚至可能质疑研究中所假定的安全措施的基本依据。

1.3.2.3 忽视连锁反应

为了发挥实效，危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）不仅要识别问题，还应该考虑潜在的解决方案。然而，这其中需要取得平衡，因为通常没有足够的时间来全面评估任何提议的设计变更。Kletz 指出，未能考虑潜在的连锁效应是一个特别值得关注的问题 [2]。

插文 1.38

在 HAZOP 过程中，如果对设计（或操作条件）进行更改，可能会影响工厂的其他部分，包括已经分析过的区域。

举个例子，在一次 HAZOP 中，团队决定为一个热交换器连接一个备用冷却水源。原有的水源很干净，但备用水源却被污染了。因此，团队不得不更改热交换器和连接管道所使用的钢材等级。他们还必须考虑原有管道中可能出现的反向流动问题。

行动措施的表述方式可能会显著影响其实施效果。如果表述过于具体，可能导致在没有充分评估预期和非预期后果的情况下就匆忙实施。然而，笼统的「考虑」某项变更的行动措施往往会被人轻易地搪塞过去，声称已经考虑过并决定不需要做任何改变。

1.3.3 缺乏后续跟进显然，HAZOP 本身并不能提高安全性。真正起作用的是由此产生的具体行动。

对于来自 HAZOP（危害与可操作性分析，Hazard and Operability Study）或任何其他研究的建议行动被拒绝是可以理解的，但不应该被完全忽视。在大多数情况下，拒绝某项建议时应该提供合理的解释，通常是因为找到了一个更有效的替代方案。即使决定拒绝某项行动而不采取任何措施，也应该清楚地解释为什么认为当前风险是可以接受的，并且已经达到了合理可行尽量降低（ALARP，As Low As Reasonably Practicable）的程度。正如文献 [15] 中所说："对一个公司而言，进行了 HAZOP 分析却忽视其建议，比完全不进行 HAZOP 分析更加有害。"

有一种做法需要特别警惕，那就是将建议的行动推迟到项目的后期阶段 [15]。这种做法往往会导致原本的行动建议被草率地关闭，因为当前的项目参与者认为他们暂时无法实施解决方案。对于这种情况，只有在将该行动转移到另一个跟踪系统（比如风险登记册，用于记录和跟踪项目风险的工具）以确保日后得到适当关注时，才应该关闭该行动项。否则，应该将该行动标记为「延期」，并详细说明在什么时候需要重新审视和解决这个问题。

将 HAZOP（危险与可操作性分析）作为强制性活动的一个问题，无论是作为项目的一部分还是作为计划中的回顾性审查，是它可能被视为一种「例行公事」，人们认为只需快速轻松地完成，目的是发现尽可能少的问题。为了部分避免这种情况，可以确保制定清晰的程序来描述如何执行 HAZOP，但仍需强调其重要性。让一位高级经理负责 HAZOP 报告的最终「签字」可以提高他们对此事的重视程度 [14]。在这方面，管理者的责任是确认所有行动都已完成或正式接受为例外情况，并且 HAZOP 过程已按公司指南由合格人员执行。

1.3.4 HAZOP 可能无法避免的事故

Kletz 明确指出，HAZOP 无法预防所有事故 [2]。

文本框 1.39

HAZOP 无法预防所有事故，至少有三个原因：(a）作为人类，我们难免会有疏漏，无法预见所有可能出错的地方；(b）人们的行为并不总是符合我们的预期；(c）由于 HAZOP 的特性，它无法预防某些机械事故，例如人们碰撞到位置不当的设备。

Kletz 强调，HAZOP 团队必须假设系统将被正确操作和维护 [2]。

文本框 1.40

他们假设总体管理水平是 competent 的，工厂的运营和维护将符合设计团队的设想，并遵循良好的管理和工程实践。特别是，他们假设保护系统将定期进行测试，并在必要时得到及时修复。

如果这些假设不成立，那么危害和可操作性研究（HAZOP）就是在浪费时间。如果没有人愿意采取任何行动，那么识别危险或估计其概率就毫无意义；如果没有人会使用或维护它们，那么安装跳闸保护和警报系统也是徒劳的。与其花时间进行 HAZOP，不如将这些时间用于将员工和管理层的安全意识提升到标准水平。

1.3.4.1 Piper Alpha（派珀阿尔法平台)

Piper Alpha 悲剧导致 167 人在一座海上石油生产平台起火时丧生，这是因为在压力安全阀（PSV）被拆除进行维护的位置发生了碳氢化合物（主要成分是石油和天然气）泄漏。虽然 HAZOP 会将 PSV 识别为防止管道过压的安全保护措施，但它会假设只要存在碳氢化合物，PSV 就应该始终处于正常工作状态。

从最基本的角度来看，Piper Alpha 事故的发生是由于管道接头处泄漏了碳氢化合物（hydrocarbon）。具体是哪个接头泄漏并不是最关键的。事故的根本原因在于维护和隔离管理的严重缺陷。虽然危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）可以在宏观层面强调这些流程的重要性，但它无法涵盖所有具体情况。

然而，如果当时在 Piper Alpha 平台上进行了 HAZOP 分析，可能就会发现有必要采取行动，考虑如何降低蒸气云爆炸的潜在危害。正如 Kletz 所解释的 [12]：

【文本框 1.1】

凝析油区域的爆炸产生的超压摧毁了将其与原油提取设备区域隔开的防火墙。防护屏障被突破后，立即引发了大规模的油火。这场火灾以及随之而来的浓烟笼罩了整个平台，严重阻碍了人员的逃生尝试。

显然，在石油平台的设计阶段，工程师们已经预见到凝析油区域可能因泄漏而引发火灾。这种情况发生的概率被认为相当高，以至于他们在装置的各个区域之间安装了防火隔离墙。考虑到这种风险评估，令人费解的是，他们似乎认为凝析油区域发生爆炸的可能性反而更低。然而，事实上，Piper Alpha 石油平台在凝析油区域的两侧都没有安装防爆墙。

更为严重的问题是，在设计阶段，工程师们没有对平台上可能发生的主要危险进行系统性的评估，在必要时还应包括定量分析。他们甚至没有对设计方案进行危害和可操作性研究（HAZOP，一种系统性的安全分析方法）。

1.3.4.2 邦斯菲尔德事故

Buncefield 石油储存库发生火灾和爆炸的原因是一个用于储存汽油的储罐被过度填充。这起事故源于操作失误，而本应在储罐液位达到特定高度时触发警报的液位仪表却未能正常工作。通过危害和可操作性研究（HAZOP）本可以将高液位警报识别为防止此类事故的安全保障措施，这本应是研究的合理结果。然而，HAZOP 团队必须假设，一旦安装，这些仪器将会得到妥善维护并保持在可操作状态。尽管该研究可以用来强调安全保障措施的重要性，但这种强调也只能停留在一般层面上，因为它适用于与警报和自动停机系统相关的广泛仪器设备。

其他类型的研究，如保护层分析（LOPA），可能会对那些仅能触发警报而没有自动停机功能的仪器的充分性提供更深入的见解。但这种分析仍然基于所有设备都得到适当维护的假设。

另一种方法是进行固有安全设计研究。这种研究可能已经确定了消除巨大蒸汽云爆炸潜在风险的方案。它着眼于风险减少技术层次结构中更高级的替代方案，而不是仅仅依赖于额外的保护层（如液位开关和阀门等容易发生故障的设备）。本书的固有安全章节中包含了对 Buncefield 事故中固有安全设计考虑的讨论。

1.4 实际应用本章旨在分享多角度的 HAZOP（危险与可操作性分析）观点，这些观点既基于 Kletz 的著作，也来源于其他人的近期经验。本节最后将为那些可能组织或参与 HAZOP 研究的人提供一些额外的实用指导。

1.4.1 HAZOP 的实施方法与时机开展 HAZOP 分析需要充分的计划和组织。Kletz 为我们提供了一些富有洞察力的观点，帮助我们理解在这个过程中需要解决的关键问题。

1.4.1.1 确保合适人员的参与

Kletz 强调，HAZOP 并非万能良药，其效果完全取决于参与人员的投入。

文本框 1.42

技术工具本身并不能发现危险；真正发现危险的是人。技术只是辅助工具，帮助人们更好地完成这项工作。HAZOP 的作用在于帮助人们运用自身的知识和经验，而这些知识和经验大多来自于学习和铭记过去的教训。

关于 HAZOP 团队在整个研究过程中是否应保持不变，Kletz 提出了自己的看法。他认为，特别是在较长期的研究中，团队成员可以适当变动。这样做有两个好处：一是可以避免团队成员因长期参与同一项目而产生的疲劳感（即 HAZOP 疲劳）；二是让不同的人参与可以使对设计、危险和潜在操作问题的理解更加广泛地分布在团队中，从而带来更多收益。

Kletz 还指出，某些特定问题可能需要专家的专业意见，但这些专家不一定需要全程参与 HAZOP 分析。

文本框 1.43

相反，如果一个工业设施存在特定问题（比如严重的腐蚀问题），这些问题的专家应该加入团队。但不要让专家仅仅为了可能需要他们的建议而坐在会议室里。

专家可以随时待命。现在远程通讯和视频会议设备已经普及，这意味着专家们不必亲临现场也能提供意见。

1.4 实际应用

1.4.1.2 不要将工作全权交给承包商一个值得关注的问题是，在一些项目中，大部分设计工作是由第三方完成的。通常，完成危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）是他们合同的一部分，这可能会让人觉得他们应该独自完成这项工作。但 Kletz 强调，这绝对不是一个好主意 [2]。

专栏 1.44

有些公司曾经对设计承包商说："我们这边人手紧张，而你们是专家，那么为什么不帮我们做 HAZOP 呢？"

客户应该与承包商一同参与项目，因为最终是客户要负责运营该工厂。危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）能够帮助客户的员工理解各种设计特征的原理，并协助他们编写操作规程。即使客户的员工最初对特定工艺的具体问题了解不多，他们也能运用一般的化学工程和科学知识，以及日常经验来贡献自己的见解。Pegram 在另一个场合中指出："... 唯一有效的团队是真正承担问题的团队。因此，团队必须由那些负责实施研究结果的人员组成，而不是外部专家组。」HAZOP 分析后通常会提出一系列建议，包括程序的修改和设备的改进。虽然承包商负责后者，但客户则负责前者的实施。

1.4.1.3 如何开展 HAZOP

一些人认为他们不需要进行 HAZOP 分析，因为他们只处理小型项目，他们（错误地）认为 HAZOP 不适用于这些项目。这种想法不仅导致小型项目缺乏必要的安全审查，还可能使公司和人员在面对大型项目时措手不及。Kletz 对此观点进行了总结 [2]。

框 1.45

相反，我们应该从小处着手，先将危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）应用于一两个项目，看看是否有效。如果效果不错，我们可以逐步扩大应用范围，直到对所有新建工厂和尽可能多的现有工厂都进行 HAZOP 分析。

1.4.1.4 工厂改造也需要进行 HAZOP 分析

Kletz 注意到，人们有时认为 HAZOP 只适用于新项目，因此在进行改造时往往不会使用。他对此表示担忧，并总结如下 [2]：

> 
> 一项未经充分考虑的改造可能会在随后的几个月里引发一系列连锁反应，甚至影响到工厂的偏远区域。
> 
> ——N. Pegram，《化学工程师》第 482 期，1990 年他进一步解释道 [2]：

> 文本框 1.47
> 
> 许多人认为 HAZOP 不适合小型改造，因为每次安装新阀门、增加采样点或提高操作温度时，都很难组织一个团队进行分析。然而，许多事故的发生正是由于改造带来了意想不到的负面影响。因此，即使不进行完整的 HAZOP 分析，在批准任何改造方案之前，也应该对其进行彻底的审查。

在进行改造时，不要忽视以下几点：

- 临时改造与永久改造同样重要；
- 新建工厂的启动改造和现有工厂的改造都需要注意；
- 不论改造成本高低，都应该谨慎对待；以及

- 对程序、生产材料或操作条件的修改，以及对设备的改动。

在任何变更管理（Management of Change）程序中，考虑进行危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）的要求应该是不可或缺的。应该明确指出在哪些情况下 HAZOP 是强制性的、推荐的或不需要的。

1.4.1.5 ' 合理可行 ' 原则的应用一个常见的担忧是，公司必须执行 HAZOP 分析所提出的所有建议，即使这些建议非常昂贵。然而，Kletz 指出这种观点并非总是正确的 [2]。

> 文本框 1.48
> 
> HAZOP 能够发现问题并提出解决方案。但如果解决这些问题的成本过高，而风险又不是完全不可接受的（用法律术语来说，如果采取措施不是「合理可行的"），我们就不必强制执行这些解决方案。然而，我们也不应该因为担心发现不想看到的问题就闭上眼睛视而不见。

显然，要证明风险已经降低到合理可行且实际可行的水平（ALARP，As Low As Reasonably Practicable），远不止是因为某项措施昂贵就简单地拒绝它。任何拒绝采取行动的决定都应该有详细记录的理由，主要关注为什么认为风险降低的程度不够。理想情况下，应该提出一个替代方案来解决 HAZOP 中提出的问题，这个方案应该更有效和 / 或更经济。

1.4.1.6 自动化 HAZOP

随着技术的发展，HAZOP 分析也在向自动化方向演进。下面我们将探讨自动化 HAZOP 的优势和挑战。

如今，用于记录 HAZOP（危险与可操作性分析）输入和输出的软件已经广泛普及，但研究人员希望在此基础上更进一步，实现 HAZOP 过程的自动化。多年来，许多研究团队一直在探索这个方向，但迄今为止还没有一个团队成功开发出可实际应用的系统。这可能是因为计算机难以模拟知识丰富、经验丰富的团队所具备的创造力和判断力。在这个领域，Kletz 曾参与相关研究并分享了他的见解 [2]。

文本框 1.49

计算机目前被广泛应用于记录结果和提醒团队关注常见的偏差原因。此外，一些旨在生成技术问题清单的程序也已经开发出来，但目前使用还不广泛。然而，计算机很难识别那些源于人与人之间互动（或缺乏互动）而产生的问题。

1.4.1.7 其他类型的 HAZOP

HAZOP 只是危险识别研究中众多方法之一。为了满足特定需求，研究人员开发了一些 HAZOP 的变体。以下是几种较为知名的变体：

- 批次 HAZOP：适用于批处理过程。在这种方法中，除了标准的引导词外，还增加了「过早」、「过晚」、「之前」、「之后」等时序相关的引导词；

- 人员或程序 HAZOP：这种方法主要关注人为错误，分析其可能造成的后果以及相应的控制措施；

- 软件或控制 HAZOP（CHAZOP)：专门用于识别软件系统中的潜在弱点和错误，提高软件的安全性和可靠性。

使用这些危害分析方法的研究可以采用与标准危害和可操作性分析（HAZOP）非常相似的方法，但需要具备相关专业知识的团队领导和 / 或团队成员。

1.4.2 过程 HAZOP 的具体注意事项

Kletz 为我们提供了在进行过程工业 HAZOP 时需要注意的许多具体事项。这些事项有助于我们更全面地识别和评估潜在的危害。

1.4.2.1 容器的 HAZOP

Kletz 建议在 HAZOP 过程中有时需要对容器进行特别考虑 [2]。

文本框 1.50

在分析完所有通向容器的管线后，我们会将引导词「OTHER THAN」（除此之外）应用于该容器。虽然对容器本身应用其他引导词并非必要，因为大多数问题应该在分析进出口管线时被发现，但为了减少遗漏的可能性，我们仍应将引导词应用于容器中进行的所有操作。例如，如果容器内发生沉降，我们会考虑是否可能出现无沉降、反向沉降（即混合）、沉降过多或过少的情况。同样的方法也适用于搅拌、加热、冷却和其他任何操作。

1.4.2.2 中间储存

Kletz 对固有安全的关注使他说了这样一句话："你应该长出白发，而不是依赖中间储存。」这句话形象地表达了他对减少中间储存的重视。尽管如此，中间储存通常是必需的，因此在 HAZOP 分析中应该得到特别关注 [2]。

1. 危害和可操作性（HAZOP）分析文本框 1.51

（注：原文中此处只有标题，没有具体内容。）

请特别关注中间存储设备。一般来说，除了装料和卸料，这些设备中不应该发生其他变化。但是，如果内容物停留的时间比平常长，可能会出现温度或成分的变化。

1.4.2.3 小型支线

Kletz 指出，危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）可能会过于关注大型设备，这有时会导致看似不太重要的部分被忽视，比如小型支线 [2]。

文本框 1.52

不要忽视那些可能没有编号的小型支线。举个例子，一个储罐装有一个加料漏斗，用于添加稳定剂。在进行 HAZOP 时，显然应该考虑添加剂量过多、过少，使用错误添加剂或在错误时间添加等情况的影响。但如果团队只研究有编号的管线，这些情况可能会被忽略。（不过，他们可能会通过考虑容器内的操作而发现这一问题，这也是 HAZOP 经常给我们第二次发现问题机会的另一个例子。）

1.4.2.4 询问设计细节

Kletz 建议，HAZOP 是一个很好的机会来询问一系列设计细节，这些细节可能并不总是直接与工艺过程相关 [2]。

文本框 1.53

HAZOP 还提供了一个机会，让我们检查设计过程中是否考虑了一些具体细节。团队应该提出以下问题：

- 使用了哪些类型的密封垫？是否应该使用金属缠绕垫片？密封垫的种类是否已控制到最少？(我们使用的种类越多，误用的可能性就越大。)

- 螺母和螺栓的种类是否已控制到最少？

- 所使用的阀门是否属于那种位置一目了然的类型，比如升降杆阀？

- 如果使用了球阀或旋塞阀，它们的手柄是否有可能被安装在错误的位置？

- 在预计需要定期进行盲板操作（用于维护或防止污染）的接头处，是否安装了双面盲板？

- 通常，可达性问题会在设计的后期阶段考虑，即当工厂模型（实物或计算机模型）可用时。但是危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP）团队应该注意任何需要特别关注的点。例如，那些需要频繁操作或在紧急情况下操作的阀门应该易于接近。

1.4.3 总结

Kletz 分享了关于 HAZOP 潜在威力的以下观点 [2]。

插文 1.54

Carling 描述了在他的公司中使用危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Analysis）的效果。这些收益远远超出了一份简单的安全工厂建议清单。团队成员之间的互动带来了个人和部门态度的深刻变化。员工开始主动寻找同事讨论 proposed 变更可能带来的后果，问题被更公开地讨论，部门间的竞争和壁垒逐渐消除。大家更深刻地认识到了独立工作的风险，以及草率和仓促行动可能造成的严重后果。知识、想法和经验得到了更充分的分享，这既有利于个人，也有利于公司的发展。

Carling 的公司是在经历了几次严重事故后才采用 HAZOP 的。Buzzelli 写道："对于一个一直以技术安全成就为傲的行业来说，不得不承认我们大多数重要的安全改进都是在响应工厂事故后才开发的，这实在是一个发人深省的事实。"

但事情不必如此。HAZOP 就像是为我们的航船提供了一盏前照灯，让我们能够在危险真正造成损害之前就发现它们。

一份回顾了 40 种不同危险识别方法的出版物总结了 HAZOP 的优点如下：

- 这是一种系统性和全面的技术。有一个详细的执行计划，它能系统地将指导词（guidewords）和参数（parameters）应用于过程中的所有管道和设备。

- 它分析失效可能带来的影响。评估团队应当仔细考虑已识别出的偏差可能导致的后果。这有助于制定建议，以最小化或减轻潜在的危害。

同一研究还总结了危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）方法的以下缺点：

- 耗时且成本高。大多数工厂都包含大量的管道和设备，每一个都需要通过应用各种引导词和参数进行详细检查。

- 需要详细的设计图纸才能进行完整的研究。为了全面执行 HAZOP 分析，生产过程必须设计得足够详细，包括所有管道和设备的运行条件以及控制仪器的具体信息。

- 对于特殊危险需要额外的引导词。一般引导词可能无法涵盖某些特定的危险，因此需要引入额外的专门词语（例如核工业中的「辐射"）。

- 需要经验丰富的专家。需要有丰富经验的团队成员来识别偏差的所有可能原因和后果，并提出切实可行的建议。

- 只关注单一事件导致的偏差。这种方法只能研究与单一偏差相关的危险。由两个或更多独立偏差共同引起的危险无法通过该技术识别。

另一项研究 [13] 表明，危害和可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Analysis）在确保系统的「概念设计、配置和规格说明」方面非常有效，这有助于改进制造、调试、操作和维护工厂的各项规格。除此之外，HAZOP 还带来了许多额外的好处，包括可以作为系统生命周期内决策的重要参考，特别是在进行系统修改时。此外，它还能以一种特殊的方式教育相关人员，有助于改进未来的设计并消除不同专业领域之间的潜在冲突。

在设计阶段进行的 HAZOP 分析为我们提供了机会，既可以避免那些发生概率高但后果较轻的事件，又能确保针对那些虽然发生概率低但后果严重的事件采取适当的防护措施。而在系统运行一段时间后回过头来进行的 HAZOP 分析则具有经验优势，能够让我们更深入地了解潜在问题，以及这些问题演变为事件甚至可能酿成事故的可能性 [13]。

HAZOP 是少数几种拥有正式指导方法的分析技术之一。然而，我们不应将其视为识别危险的唯一选择。实际上，选择何种方法应该根据具体应用场景和可用资源来决定 [9]。
