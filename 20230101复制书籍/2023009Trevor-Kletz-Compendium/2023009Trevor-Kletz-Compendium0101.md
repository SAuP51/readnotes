## 0101. Hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis

### 1.1 Introduction

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is considered to be one of the key methods when managing process safety. Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) is the most well-known, widely used, and effective PHA method.

Kletz stated in his autobiography [1] that there was an "obvious need to find out what can go wrong without waiting until it has gone wrong. HAZOP is the preferred technique in the process industries."

Kletz has sometimes been credited with developing the concept of HAZOP, but that is not true. HAZOP grew out of ‘critical examination', a technique which was popular with ICIa during the 1960s for examining management decisions. Ken Gee, a production manager with ICI, decided to apply this technique to the design of a new phenol plant and, over a 4-month period, spent 3 days a week, every week, examining every aspect of the plant, discovering many potential hazards and operating problems that would not have been foreseen otherwise. Kletz said this was the first recognizable HAZOP [1].

Kletz used the following quote to illustrate the role of HAZOP for predicting potential problems [2]:

Text Box 1.1

Samuel Coleridge described history as a ‘lantern on the stern', illuminating the hazards the ship has passed through rather than those that lie ahead. It is better to illuminate the hazards we have passed through than not illuminate them at all as we may pass the same way again, but we should try to see them before we meet them. HAZOP can be a lantern on the bow.

a) ICI was a large British chemicals company, which is now defunct, but parts of it are now incorporated into other companies and many of the old sites are still occupied by process plants.

Although Kletz did not develop the method, he had a significant role in its adoption across the process industry. He encouraged public courses to be held at UK universities, with the first at Teesside Polytechnic (now a University) in 1975 and followed by UMIST in 1978. Kletz's motivation was the knowledge that HAZOP led to safer process plants and operations, but it is a sign of his communication skills that he not only persuaded universities to run courses but he was also successful at obtaining agreement from his employer, ICI, to make the method widely available to others, including competitors.

HAZOP has become the method of choice for identifying hazards and operability issues in process plant design. In most HAZOPs more operability problems are identified than hazards. Like all methods it has its limitations. However, HAZOP is used widely beyond the process industry, where the approaches taken are adapted to suit the particular requirements.

1.1 引言过程危害分析（Process Hazard Analysis，PHA）被认为是管理过程安全的关键方法之一。其中，危害和操作性研究（Hazard and Operability Study，HAZOP）是最著名、应用最广泛和最有效的 PHA 方法。

Kletz 在他的自传 [1] 中指出："我们显然需要在事故发生之前就找出可能出错的地方。在过程工业中，HAZOP 是实现这一目标的首选技术。"

虽然有时人们会将 HAZOP 的概念归功于 Kletz，但事实并非如此。HAZOP 其实源于「批判性检查」，这是 20 世纪 60 年代英国帝国化学工业公司（ICI）常用的一种管理决策审查技术。ICI 的一位生产经理 Ken Gee 决定将这种技术应用于新建苯酚工厂的设计中。在 4 个月的时间里，他每周花 3 天时间仔细检查工厂的各个方面，由此发现了许多原本难以预见的潜在危害和操作问题。Kletz 称这次尝试是第一个可辨识的 HAZOP [1]。

Kletz 引用了以下名言来阐述 HAZOP 在预测潜在问题方面的作用 [2]：

Samuel Coleridge 曾将历史比喻为「船尾的灯笼」，它只能照亮船只已经驶过的危险区域，而不是前方将要面对的危险。虽然回顾过往的危险总比完全忽视要好，因为我们可能会重蹈覆辙，但更理想的做法是在遇到危险之前就能预见它们。在这个意义上，HAZOP 就像是船头的灯笼，为我们照亮前方的航程。

a）ICI（Imperial Chemical Industries，英国帝国化学工业公司）曾是英国一家大型化工企业。虽然该公司已经不复存在，但其部分业务已被其他公司收购，而且许多原有的工厂场地仍在继续运营，用于各种化工生产过程。

尽管 Kletz 并非危害与可操作性研究（HAZOP）方法的发明者，但他在推动整个加工行业采用这一方法方面发挥了重要作用。他积极倡导在英国各大学举办公开课程，首次课程于 1975 年在 Teesside Polytechnic（现已升格为大学）举办，随后在 1978 年，曼彻斯特理工学院（UMIST）也开设了相关课程。Kletz 之所以如此热心推广 HAZOP，是因为他深知这一方法能够显著提高加工厂的安全性和操作可靠性。值得一提的是，Kletz 不仅成功说服了各大学开设 HAZOP 课程，还说服了他的雇主 ICI 同意将这一方法广泛分享给其他公司，甚至包括竞争对手。这充分展现了他卓越的沟通能力。

如今，HAZOP 已成为识别加工厂设计中潜在危害和操作问题的首选方法。有趣的是，在大多数 HAZOP 研究中，发现的操作问题往往比安全隐患更多。当然，像任何方法一样，HAZOP 也有其局限性。尽管如此，HAZOP 的应用范围已经远远超出了加工行业，在其他领域的应用中，研究方法会根据具体需求进行相应的调整。

1.1.1 What is HAZOP?

Kletz described HAZOP as follows:

Text Box 1.2

HAZOP is a technique which provides opportunities for people to let their imaginations go free and think of all possible ways in which hazards or operating problems might arise, but—to reduce the chance that something is missed—it is done in a systematic way, and each pipeline and each sort of hazard is considered in turn. The study is carried out by a team so that the members can stimulate each other and build upon each other's ideas.

A more formal definition is provided by Eggett and Whitty:

HAZOP is a formal, qualitative, systematic and rigorous examination of a plant, process or operation, in order to identify credible deviations from the design intent in the context of the complete system, which can contribute to the realisation of hazards or operability problems, by applying the experience, judgement and imagination, stimulated by key words, of a team.

The core principle of HAZOP is that problems only arise when there is a deviation from either normal operation or a system's design intent.

1.1.1 什么是 HAZOP？

Kletz 对 HAZOP 的描述如下：

专栏 1.2

危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）是一种特殊的技术。它鼓励人们发挥想象力，尽可能地思考可能出现的危险或操作问题。为了降低遗漏重要信息的风险，这项技术采用系统化的方法，逐一考虑每个管道和每种潜在危险。HAZOP 分析通常由一个团队共同完成，团队成员之间可以相互启发，在彼此的想法基础上不断创新。

Eggett 和 Whitty 对 HAZOP 提供了一个更为正式的定义：

HAZOP 是一种正式的、定性的、系统化且严格的检查方法，用于分析工厂、流程或操作。它的目的是在整个系统的背景下，识别那些可能偏离原始设计意图的情况（即可信偏差），这些偏差可能导致危险或操作问题。分析过程中，团队成员会运用他们的经验、判断力和想象力，并在关键词的引导下展开讨论。

HAZOP 的核心理念是：问题只会在偏离正常操作或系统设计意图时才会出现。

1.1.1.1 HAZOP basics

HAZOP is a qualitative process involving a structured and systematic examination of a system. The first activity is to break the system into ‘nodes', each of which has a clear identity but is not too large to assess. For process plant the current approach is to identify nodes by section or by major equipment item. The main working document for a HAZOP is the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID).

The objectives of HAZOP are to identify all the deviations that can have a consequence and decide whether action is required to control the hazard or operability issue. This is performed by the assessment team in a meeting or workshop, which is recorded by a scribe.

Documenting the HAZOP provides an effective means of capturing inputs and outputs and communicating potential hazards and operability problems to the people who operate, maintain, and manage the facility.

1.1.1.1 HAZOP 基础知识

HAZOP 是一个定性的过程，涉及对系统进行结构化和系统化的检查。首要任务是将系统划分为若干个「节点」（node），每个节点都有明确的特征，但规模不至于大到难以评估。对于工艺装置而言，当前的做法是按照部分或主要设备来划分节点。HAZOP 分析的主要工作文件是管道和仪表图（Piping and Instrumentation Diagram，P&ID）。

危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Analysis）的目标是识别所有可能产生后果的偏差，并决定是否需要采取行动来控制潜在的危险或操作问题。这个过程通常由评估团队在会议或研讨会中执行，并由专门的文档记录员详细记录。

记录 HAZOP 的过程不仅能有效捕捉分析的输入和输出，还能向设施的操作、维护和管理人员清晰传达潜在的危险和操作问题。

1.1.1.2 A simple example

A simple node consisting of a tank and associated pumps and valves is shown in Fig. 1.1 as a very simple example. The design intent is stated as follows: 'Pump P1 supplies petrol to a storage tank, which is vented to a safe location. P2 delivers petrol from the tank'.

During the HAZOP the node is examined and the scribe records the output of the team's deliberations and conclusions. This information is recorded as shown in Table 1.1.

This is only a very simple example. A full HAZOP would consider many other deviations and the plant would have other nodes.

1.1.1.3 Parameters and guidewords

A HAZOP is conducted by considering a range of parameters applicable to the type of system and a range of guidewords applicable to the parameter. The aim is to assist the HAZOP team to consider all possible deviations. This helps them to avoid becoming fixated on the more obvious or known issues, which may mean others that may be less obvious but potentially significant are overlooked.

In the process industry the typical parameters include flow, pressure, and temperature, and the guidewords include none, more, less, and different. They have been developed to cover the main scenarios that are known to result in major accidents and significant operational problems. The aim is to combine parameters and guidewords to obtain meaningful deviations, for example no flow, more pressure, less temperature.

**FIG. 1.1** Example node for a simple HAZOP.

| # | Deviation | Cause      | Consequences             | Safeguards          | Actions                          |
|----|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | More flow | None identified |                   |             |                              |
| 2 | No flow  | Pump P1 stopped | Tank not filled           | None             |                              |
| 3 |      | Valve V1 shut  | Tank not filled           | None             | Install a pump temperature trip              |
|  |      |         | P1 damaged, possible fire or explosion| None             |                              |
| 4 | High level| Delay stopping P1| Tank overflows. Possible explosion  | Level gauge monitored by Operator | Install a high level alarm and high-high level trip that stops P1 |

Guidewords vary depending on the industry, but are usually defined in sector guidance. There is a school of thought that says the lists are prescriptive and should not be changed or added to. Kletz did not agree [2].

Text Box 1.3

They are based on long experience but, nevertheless, if you find other words are useful, by all means use them, particularly if you are applying HAZOP outside the type of activity for which it was originally designed.

1.1.1.2 一个简单的例子

图 1：展示了一个简单的系统节点，包括一个储罐及其相关的泵和阀门。这个设计的目的如下：泵 P1 向储罐供应汽油，储罐通过管道排气至安全位置。泵 P2 则负责从储罐中输送汽油。

在 HAZOP 分析过程中，团队会仔细检查这个节点，文档记录员会详细记录团队的讨论过程和得出的结论。表 1 展示了这些记录的格式和内容。

需要注意的是，这只是一个非常简化的例子。在实际的 HAZOP 分析中，我们会考虑更多的可能偏差，且整个工厂通常包含多个需要分析的节点。

**图 1.1** 简单危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）的示例节点。

| 序号 | 异常情况 | 原因 | 后果 | 现有安全措施 | 建议采取的行动 |
|----|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | 流量过大 | 未发现 |          |       |               |
| 2 | 无流量 | 泵（P1）停止运转 | 储存罐无法充满 | 无 |               |
| 3 |   | 阀门（V1）关闭 | 储存罐无法充满 | 无 | 安装泵温度自动断电保护装置 |
| |   |     | 泵（P1）损坏，可能引发火灾或爆炸 | 无 |               |
| 4 | 液位过高 | 延迟关闭泵（P1）| 储存罐溢出。可能引发爆炸 | 操作员通过液位计监控 | 安装高液位警报和极高液位自动断泵装置 |

1.1.1.3 参数和指导词

HAZOP 分析通过考虑一系列适用于特定系统类型的参数，以及与这些参数相关的指导词来进行。这种方法旨在帮助 HAZOP 团队全面考虑所有可能的偏差。它能有效防止团队仅聚焦于明显或已知的问题，从而忽视了那些可能不太明显但同样重要的潜在问题。

在工业生产过程中，我们通常关注的参数包括流量、压力和温度。为了分析可能出现的问题，我们使用一些关键词，如「无」、「过多」、「过少」和「异常」。这些参数和关键词的组合已经被开发出来，用于覆盖已知可能导致重大事故和严重操作问题的主要情况。我们的目标是将这些参数和关键词结合起来，得出有意义的异常情况，比如没有流量、压力过高、温度过低等。

引导词（Guidewords）在不同行业中有所不同，但通常在行业指南中有明确定义。有一种观点认为这些引导词列表是固定的，不应该被修改或增添。然而，著名化工安全专家特雷弗·克莱茨（Trevor Kletz）并不赞同这种观点 [2]。

> 引导词虽然是基于长期经验总结而来，但如果你发现其他词语更有用，请随意使用，尤其是当你将危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）应用于其原本设计用途之外的领域时。


1.1.1.4 HAZOP method

Whilst flexible use of guidewords may be acceptable, only studies that follow the defined method should be considered as a HAZOP. The procedure for each node is as follows:

1. Define the node and its design intent;

2. Work through all combinations of parameter and guideword for the node to identify possible deviations (situations where the node would deviate from its design intent);

3. Identify the potential causes of all meaningful deviations identified;

4. Identify potential consequences of each deviation and cause;

5. Identify existing safeguards in place to control the risks of the cause and consequence;

6. Consider the adequacy of safeguards and possible opportunities to reduce risk; and

7. Record the results for future reference.

HAZOP is performed in a meeting or workshop controlled by a team leader. Nodes are selected and displayed to the team so that they know what is being discussed. In the process industry this is usually achieved by marking the nodes on the Piping and Instrument Diagram (P&ID) using coloured marker pens and laying them out on a table, pinning them to the wall, or issuing duplicate copies so that every member of the team can see them. This can also be done electronically so that the marked up drawing can be displayed using a projector (but hand marking is often found to be easier).

The team leader identifies and summarises the node and encourages the team to consider all possible deviations. A scribe is usually appointed to take detailed notes but he/she is also a contributing member of the team.

The details for the HAZOP method may vary in different industries but the basic method should be the same. For an up-to-date description of the HAZOP method for the process industry, refer to the ‘HAZOP Guide to Best Practice' published by the Institution of Chemical Engineers [5].

1.1.1.5 Recording the output from HAZOP

The value of a HAZOP is somewhat limited if its results are not recorded in a useful and accessible way. In the time before personal computers, handwritten notes would have been taken and a final record would be made by typing a report. Whilst this remains an option it is now far more common for a scribe to make records using a computer. Generic spreadsheet or word processing software can be used but proprietary software is available that provides templates and handles follow-up reporting and monitoring.

Whether proprietary or generic software is used the output is captured in a table with columns to record deviations, causes, consequences, safeguards, and follow-up actions. This may not be considered as a particularly fascinating read but having a full record of what was discussed and the basis for evaluations and decisions can be essential in the future to confirm a design is appropriate and demonstrate that risks are As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). Failure to follow the correct HAZOP method or record the results in full will inevitably cause problems in the future.

Text Box 1.4

Some of the factors to be considered when choosing a programme for recording the results of HAZOPs:

- Is it simple to use? How much training is required?

- Is it well proven?

- What are the initial and ongoing costs?

- What is the availability and cost of support?

- Are updates available?

- Is it compatible with other programmes?

- What other studies are included?

- Can it be customised? (e.g. can additional columns be added to indicate items which have to be reported to internal or external authorities?)

- Does it include a comprehensive list of prompts?

- How does it monitor actions and changes?

- How are data on failure rates included?

- Can it be linked to accident databases?

- Does it have a spell-check facility?

1.1.2 When is HAZOP carried out?

Although very effective and having wide application, HAZOP is not the only safety study available and it is not always the right method to use. Like many things, it is a case of using the right tool to do the right job at the right time.

1.1.2.1 Original role of HAZOP on new projects

Kletz was very clear about the timing of a HAZOP.

Text Box 1.5

A HAZOP cannot be carried out before the line diagrams, complete with control instrumentation (that is, process and instrumentation diagrams) are complete. It should be carried out as soon as possible thereafter, before detailed design starts. The ‘window of opportunity' is thus limited, so plan the meetings well in advance. It is no use waiting until the line diagrams are ready and then expecting the members of the team to be available.

If an existing plant is being studied the first step is to bring the line diagrams up to date or check that they are up to date. Carrying out a HAZOP on an incorrect line diagram is the most useless occupation in the world. It is as effective as setting out on a journey with a railway timetable 10 years out of date.

The timing of HAZOP was formalised by ICI (the company where HAZOP originated) with this six stage process:

1. Exploratory phase—identification of basic hazards and review of sites, check for availability of data;

2. Flowsheet phase—coarse HAZOP using Process Flow Diagrams (PFD), identification and assessment of significant hazards;

3. Detailed design—HAZOP on ‘frozen' P&IDs;

4. Construction—check that decisions made in earlier studies have been implemented, including hardware and software;

5. Commissioning—precommissioning check and final inspection; and

6. Postcommissioning—safety audit and review after a few months of operation.

The general expectation was that a full HAZOP was performed once. Kletz highlighted the challenges of including HAZOP in a project plan [2].

Text Box 1.6

The HAZOP on a large project may take several months, even with two or three teams working in parallel on different sections of the plant. It is thus necessary to either:

(a) Hold up detailed design and construction until the HAZOP is complete; or.

(b) Allow detailed design and construction to go ahead and risk having to modify the detailed design or even alter the plant when the results of the HAZOP are known.

Ideally, the design should be planned to allow time for (a) but if completion is urgent (b) may have to be accepted.

1.1.2.2 Current approaches to integrating HAZOP into new projects

HAZOP may not be defined as a legal requirement anywhere in the world but it has been accepted as a standard method. It is recognised as a valid technique in international standards [6] and it is mentioned very widely in guidance from regulators, institutions, and trade bodies.

In other words, companies are free to decide if a HAZOP is required, but if they decide not to perform one or choose to use a different method they had better have a good explanation about why their approach was better.

All significant projects in the process industry are now usually run in stages, often completed by different teams or contractors. As the project progresses through each stage the quality of information and detail improves. But the same issues remain about doing HAZOP too early or too late. One way of overcoming this is to repeat HAZOP several times during a project. The idea being that information about deviations, causes, consequences, and safeguards can be continually improved as the design develops.

As Kletz said, there is no value in doing HAZOP too early. For example during the earliest phase of a project (concept development) the process and its control are not sufficiently developed. At this time a Hazard Identification (HAZID) (another multidisciplinary workshop-based study) is more appropriate for identifying the major hazards and predicting their possible consequences so that design requirements can be identified. HAZOP is used later in the project to provide the detail of how these identified hazards may be realised and controlled, and to identify any that were not evident at the HAZID.

The first realistic opportunity to perform a worthwhile HAZOP is during Front End Engineering Design (FEED) based on PFDs or preliminary P&IDs. It is performed at a high level using a limited set of guidewords. To be useful a basic control logic should be available.

The most important HAZOP is likely to be performed during detailed design, when P&IDs are mature enough that they can be ‘frozen', so that design changes cannot be made until the HAZOP is complete.

HAZOP reports are often a key document in the handover between the teams or contractors performing each phase of the project. They are a valuable reference to show what issues were considered and why the design was considered to be fit for purpose.

1.1.2.3 Retrospective HAZOP

There can be a number of reasons why a HAZOP may be carried out retrospectively, for a system that already exists and is in operation. It may be because a HAZOP was not carried out when it was designed, or that changes have occurred which means that the existing HAZOP is no longer representative of its actual operation. Another reason could be to thoroughly check an acquired plant.

A retrospective HAZOP can be carried out in the same way as during design but this may not always be the most effective approach. Having practical experience of operation can help to optimise the process and reduce some uncertainty.

HAZOP can be time consuming and require a lot of resource. Other methods are available that make more use of the additional information available for a retrospective study that may be more appropriate. Process Hazard Review (PHR) is one example. It was also developed by ICI and uses a similar guideword approach. It examines the system at a higher level instead of the detailed nodes used by HAZOP and is reported to be up to five times quicker.

1.1.2.4 Reviewing previous HAZOP reports

It was common in the past to perform a HAZOP during design, implement any actions, and then file the report away in the archives. This is no longer considered as acceptable and periodic reviews should be carried out to ensure that the study remains relevant and useful. Industries required by law to generate Safety Cases or Safety Reports will usually be expected to review and update these every 4 or 5 years. This seems to be a reasonable frequency for reviewing and updating a HAZOP study and its report.

Things to look for when reviewing a previously completed HAZOP include:

- Creeping changes at the facility due to lots of small hardware and software modifications;

- Changes in the way the system is operated or tasks are performed;

- Evidence from incident reports and other sources that may suggest the HAZOP overlooked certain risks or that the specified controls are inadequate; and

- New information becoming available about hazards and the development of new good practices in industry.

If only minor issues are uncovered during a review it is normally acceptable to update the report, highlighting any changes using standard document control processes. If major issues are found it may be necessary to conduct a retrospective HAZOP or to carry out an alternative assessment for the same purpose such as PHR.

1.1.3 Why HAZOP?

Kletz explained the reason why HAZOP had to be developed.

Text Box 1.7

The traditional method of identifying hazards—in use from the dawn of technology until the present day—was to build the plant and see what happens—"every dog is allowed one bite". Until it bites someone, we can say that we did not know it would. This is not a bad method when the size of an incident is limited but is no longer satisfactory now that we keep dogs which may be as big as Bhopal (over 2000 killed in one bite) or even Flixborough (28 killed). We need to identify hazards before the accidents occur. Check-lists are often used to identify hazards but their disadvantage is that items on the list are not brought forward for consideration and our minds are closed to them. Check-lists may be satisfactory if there is little or no innovation and all the hazards have been met before, but are least satisfactory when the design is new.

These days, plants are not built ‘to see what happens' and there are very clear duties on companies to do everything reasonably practicable to identify hazards and control risks. HAZOP is probably the most recognised method available to assist with this and there is a high expectation that a HAZOP is carried out for any new major hazard facility, unless another equally effective method is used.

1.1.4 Alternatives

Motivational theorist Abraham Maslow is quoted as saying "If the only tool you have is a hammer, you will see every problem as a nail." HAZOP is one of our better tools but we have many others available. These include:

- Previous incident reports and analyses;

- Human factors and error assessment;

- Integrity management and review (particularly for aging facilities);

- Reliability analysis;

- Dynamic process simulation;

- Inherent safety review;

- ALARP reviews;

- Process materials and fluids analysis;

- Barrier analysis; and

- Safety critical element reviews and performance standards.

A study of hazard identification methods [9] identified 40 but concluded that HAZOP was one of only a few with any formal guidance. Also, it can be seen that some of the other methods available are adaptations of the standard HAZOP.

1.1.5 Accidents that should have been prevented by HAZOP

Kletz dedicated a whole chapter in his book about HAZOP [2] to describe "some accidents that could have been prevented by HAZOPs." At the time he wrote this it was probably fair to say that HAZOP was relatively uncommon. This meant that Kletz could speculate that an accident happened because of a lack of risk controls because a HAZOP had not been carried out. Things have changed and now the expectation is that HAZOP is carried out and so for more recent accidents it is more reasonable to consider why the HAZOP (or equivalent method) was not effective.

1.1.5.1 Accidents due to ‘reverse flow'

Kletz identified [2] that

Text Box 1.8

Many accidents have occurred because process materials flowed in the opposite direction to that expected and the fact that this could occur was not foreseen. For example, ethylene oxide and amine were reacted to make ethanolamine. Some ammonia flowed from the reactor, in the wrong direction, along the ethylene oxide transfer line into the ethylene oxide tank, past several nonreturn valves and a positive pump. It got past the pump through the relief valve which discharged into the pump suction line. The ammonia reacted with 30 m³ of ethylene oxide in the tank which ruptured violently. The released ethylene oxide vapour exploded causing damage and destruction over a wide area.

A hazard and operability study would have disclosed the fact that reverse flow could occur. On another occasion some paraffin passed from a reactor up a chlorine transfer line and reacted with liquid chlorine in a catchpot. Bits of the catchpot were found 30 m away.

On many occasions process materials have entered service lines, either because the service pressure was lower than usual or the process pressure was higher than usual. The contamination has then spread via the service lines (steam, air, nitrogen, water) to other parts of the plant. On one occasion ethylene entered a steam heater through a leaking heat exchanger. Another branch of the steam line supplied a space heater in the basement of the control room and the condensate was discharged to an open drain inside the building. Ethylene accumulated in the basement, and was ignited (probably by the electric equipment, which was not protected), destroying the building. Again, a HAZOP would have disclosed the route taken by the ethylene.

1.1.5.2 Texaco Pembroke Refinery (1994)

On 24 July 1994 a severe electrical storm caused major plant disturbances across the whole refinery. Whilst attempting to resume normal operations a large quantity of hydrocarbon was routed to the flare system. Liquids collected in the flare knock-out drum and eventually overflowed into the downstream flare pipework, which failed leading to a significant release. This ignited and exploded, leading to significant damage to the site and beyond. There were some injuries but fortunately no one was killed.

The flare knock-out drum had originally been designed so that any liquid collected would drain away automatically to slops. Modifications had been made to return the liquid to the process in order to reduce waste, but which significantly reduced the rate that liquid could be removed from the drum. A HAZOP of this modification should have identified that during major plant upsets the flow of liquid to the drum would have been greater than the capacity of the new draining system and also, that high level in the drum could result in liquid breakthrough into the downstream pipework, which was not designed to handle this (Fig. 1.2).

1.1.5.3 Electrostatic precipitator explosion

An explosion occurred on 18 February 2015 at a refinery in Torrance, California. A pressure deviation during preparation for maintenance allowed hydrocarbon to backflow into an electrostatic precipitator where it ignited and exploded, damaging the equipment and injuring four people in the area. The hydrocarbon was able to backflow because a side valve, which was being used as the isolation, had been eroded by solid catalyst that passed through.

FIG. 1.2 The arrangement of flare drum liquid handling before and after modifications.

it during normal operation. This valve had been identified as safety critical but the steps taken by the refinery to prove its integrity only confirmed that mechanical components were working and not whether it was effective as an isolation.

A HAZOP of this system should have identified that pressure deviations could occur and that these would result in hydrocarbon back-flowing through the slide valve to the electrostatic precipitator where ignition was likely to have occurred. It should have highlighted that an effective isolation would be required to avoid this and that a single slide valve that was used for control was very unlikely to be sufficient for this purpose.

1.1.5.4 Esso Longford

Kletz referred to the Esso Longford accident to illustrate how HAZOP could have prevented it [12].

Text Box 1.9

On 25 September 1998 a heat exchanger in the Esso gas plant in Longford, Victoria, Australia fractured, releasing hydrocarbon vapours and liquids. Explosions and a fire followed, killing two employees and injuring eight. Supplies of natural gas were interrupted throughout the State of Victoria and were not fully restored until 14 October. There was no alternative supply of gas and many industrial and domestic users were without fuel for all or part of the time that the plant was shut down.

Many companies have examined their older plants to judge their fitness for purpose, including the suitability of the materials of construction. Some equipment is replaced so that it can withstand fault conditions. In other cases control and trip systems are improved, instructions revised or the need to avoid low temperature avenues emphasised in operator training. Esso, part of the US Exxon company, decided to carry out hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) on all the old plants on their Longford site. Most of them were completed but the 1969 plant, the oldest on the site, was never studied. According to the official Report (p. 203), ‘no satisfactory reason was given in evidence for its deferral or abandonment'. A HAZOP almost certainly would have disclosed that the heat exchanger that failed could become too cold and would have led to a systematic examination of the ways in which this could occur and the actions that might be taken to prevent it. It would also have disclosed the need to provide better isolations in the connecting lines to the other units.

1.1.6 Ensuring effective HAZOP

Kletz had some concerns that people underestimated the HAZOP method, viewing it as one of the "hammers and spanners of the chemical industry" [2].

Text Box 1.10

This makes them sound too easy. They are, in fact, sophisticated tools which require long, detailed application. They are not quick fixes.

He saw that part of the problem was that, as it has become ubiquitous, people would assume that studies would automatically become ‘better and better'. His response to this view was as follows [2].

Text Box 1.11

In some ways this is true; the best are getting better. However, as with any technique, as more and more people start to use it the standard can easily fall and it can become a perfunctory exercise, carried out because the company rules (or the regulators) require it and not because those present really feel that it is worthwhile. Some auditing of the quality of HAZOPs is therefore desirable.

The key message is that HAZOP requires respect and resources. Companies should have procedures in place that define the requirements, use competent team leaders, and always involve the right people. As with all processes, continual review and audit is required. Kletz gave this perspective [2].

Text Box 1.12

As the use of any technique becomes more widespread its quality is liable to decrease. There is therefore a need to be able to audit the quality of a HAZOP. At a workshop on HAZOP held in 1995 the auditing of HAZOP was selected as the most pressing current topic. The best method of auditing is to sit in on a HAZOP. If that is not practicable—for example, because the HAZOP is complete—Rushton has described an audit scheme. The auditor samples the documentation produced by the HAZOP and looks for evidence that various modes of operation—such as start-up, shutdown and maintenance—have been considered in addition to normal operation, that the knowledge and experience of the team members were adequate, that the same people attended throughout and did so regularly, that the recommendations made were carried out, and that any late changes in design were studied. If the plant has already been commissioned the auditor should examine the problems that have arisen and see if they could reasonably have been spotted during the HAZOP. Altogether there are six aspects of suggested questions. The auditor should talk to the team members to gain their impressions and assess their knowledge and experience.

### 1.2 HAZOP organisation and process

Although HAZOP provides a method for performing a hazard analysis it relies on people to identify the relevant deviations, recognise potential hazards, and make reasonable judgements about existing safeguards and potential new ones.

1.2.1 Organising a HAZOP

From a technical perspective a HAZOP cannot take place until there is enough information about the system being assessed. For process plant this is when an up-to-date and ‘frozen' set of P&IDs are available. Once this is achieved there are three key factors for a successful HAZOP:

- A committed, knowledgeable, and creative team;

- An experienced and competent Team Leader; and

- Meeting organisation.

1.2.1.1 HAZOP team members

The make-up of the team has a significant impact on the quality of a HAZOP. The challenge is to get a group of people together who cover a range of knowledge and experience whilst keeping the process manageable. Also, to involve people who can be creative and are willing to discuss the issues. Kletz identified the following people to be involved in a HAZOP for a new facility [2].

**Text Box 1.13**

Project or design engineer

Usually a mechanical engineer and, at this stage of the project, the person responsible for keeping the costs within the sum sanctioned. The project engineer wants to minimise changes but at the same time find out now rather than later if there are any unknown hazards or operating problems.

Process engineer

Usually the chemical engineer who drew up the flowsheet.

Commissioning manager

Usually a chemical engineer, the commissioning manager will have to start up and operate the plant and is therefore inclined to press for any changes that will make life easier.

Control system design engineer

Modern plants contain sophisticated control and trip systems and HAZOPs often result in the addition of yet more instrumentation.

Research Chemist

If new chemistry is involved.

The importance of the HAZOP in verifying the safety and operability of the plant and the expense of modifications means that the Project Manager will usually attend for some if not all of the HAZOP.

Whilst Kletz suggested that ‘modern plants' would require a higher input from control systems engineers this may no longer be the case because most control software is usually not bespoke. However, knowledge of the control logic is required including any role it has in safeguarding to prevent or mitigate hazardous scenarios.

Kletz pointed out that the make-up of the team may vary according to the nature of the design process, for example [2].

Text Box 1.14

If the plant has been designed by a contractor, the HAZOP team should contain people from both the contractor and client organisation, and certain functions may have to be duplicated.

HAZOP practices have evolved and the team make-up has probably changed since Kletz first started writing on the subject. For example, it is increasingly recognised that involving experienced operators and maintenance technicians is a critical factor in achieving a good HAZOP. They are the people who know what actually happens, what works, and what doesn't. This is particularly the case for a retrospective or modification HAZOP, but even for a completely new facility practical experience can provide a real insight into potential issues that designers and project engineers might not recognise. Also, people who have spent their working lives at the sharp end of operations have usually developed robust and effective communication skills that can help the whole team focus on the critical issues and avoid getting hung up on trivia and interesting but irrelevant technical details.

Another key member of the HAZOP team, who was not mentioned by Kletz, is the Scribe.

They are usually a junior process engineer. Their role is to record the HAZOP inputs and outputs, but they are still a full team member and should be able to contribute to the technical discussions. They need to understand the discussions that take place, be reasonably quick at taking notes (typically directly on a computer nowadays), and be prepared to slow down the meeting and ask for clarification if required. The scribe usually does most of the organisational legwork, for example assembling documentation. It has been reported that "a good scribe can cut 30% of the time taken to complete a HAZOP, whereas a bad scribe can virtually wreck it."

One of the concerns of inviting people who are not usually directly involved in design (particularly operators and maintenance technicians) is that they are not familiar with the method. In fact some people invited to a HAZOP may be worried that they may struggle to understand what is going on. Kletz pointed out that team members are invited due to their knowledge and experience and are not expected to be experts at HAZOP.

Text Box 1.15

HAZOP teams, apart from the team leader, do not require much training. They can pick up the techniques as they go along. If anyone is present for the first time, the team leader should start with 10 min of explanation. However, if possible, new team members should attend a half-day lecture and discussion based on this chapter. The Institution of Chemical Engineers can supply a training package. The team leader should, however, start the discussion of each line or plant item by explaining, or asking someone to explain, its purpose.

Another key point, highlighted by Kletz, is that the value of the input made by team members is not restricted to their technical knowledge. In fact it is often their willingness to discuss the things that they do not understand that can add the most value. It is worth noting that the designers should have already considered the well-known and understood hazards and operability issues and so it is the quirky and unusual potential issues that are of most concern.

# Text Box 1.16

It might be thought that membership of a HAZOP team is "the proper toil of artless industry, a task that requires neither the light of learning, nor the activity of genius, but may he successfully performed without any higher quality than that of bearing burthens with dull patience and ... sluggish resolution," to quote Dr. Johnson. This is not the case. The best team members are creative and uninhibited people who can think of new and original ways for things to go wrong and are not too shy to suggest them. In a HAZOP, do not hesitate to suggest impossibly crazy deviations, causes, consequences or solutions as they may lead other people to think of similar but possible deviations, etc. Zetlin writes. "I look at everything and try to imagine disaster. I am always scared. Imagination and fear are among the best engineering tools for preventing tragedy.

A final point made by Kletz is that the status of the team and its members can have a big impact on a HAZOP.

# Text Box 1.17

The team should have the authority to agree most changes there and then. Progress is slow if every change has to be referred to someone who is not present. The team members should try to avoid sending deputies. They lack the knowledge of previous meetings and might not have the authority to approve changes: as a result progress is held up. Some people have told me that this is impractical in their companies as all changes have to be approved at a high level. This does not matter so long as the team members feel confident that most of their recommendations will be accepted without argument. However, if the discussions in the HAZOP meetings have to be gone through again, time is wasted.

## Team leader

The Team Leader is critical for any HAZOP and their ability to use the method, control the workshop, and manage the overall process will have a significant impact on the quality of the outcomes. Kletz summed up the main requirements.

# Text Box 1.18

Independent team leader

An expert in the HAZOP technique, not the plant. The job of the team leader is to ensure that the team follows the procedure. To be a successful team leader you need to be skilled in leading a team.

of people who are not responsible to you, and be the sort of person who pays meticulous attention to detail. It is easy to underestimate the ability required. It is not a job that anyone can do. The team leader may also supply the safety department's view on the points dictated. If not, a representative from this department should be present.

The Team Leader needs to ensure that the HAZOP participants play their part in the workshop. They need to facilitate the discussion so that everyone is actively involved and is prepared to discuss issues without becoming side-tracked. All contributions should be constructive so that solutions are identified and not just potential problems. The Team Leader should be independent of the project and some companies insist that they are provided by an external organisation (i.e. a consultant). The Team Leader should have received some formal, certified training.

Other traits of a good Team Leader include knowledge of other methods (e.g. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA), HAZID, attention to detail, and enough stamina to adhere to the method for the full duration). They need to be able to handle people, particularly the dominant personalities that may be inclined to take over the meeting and dissuade others from talking. This can be a particular problem if this person is an engineer who is overly defensive of their design.

Kletz pointed out that motivating the team is vitally important.

Text Box 1.19

Although HAZOP is a valuable technique, no-one jumps out of bed on a Monday morning shouting, ‘Hooray! I've got a HAZOP today!'. The need to consider every deviation on every line can become tedious. Beware of making it more so by bureaucratic procedures such as insisting on excessive recording or discussing everything twice (or three times)—in the HAZOP meeting and afterwards with the boss of the project team. There is a net loss if, in our eagerness to document everything to explain it to everybody, we discover less information worth documenting. If HAZOP and similar systems are not acceptable to creative minds, they will never succeed.

It is possible for the Team Leader's involvement to be limited to the duration of the workshop, with a short time later to review a report prepared by the Scribe or others. In this case they are relying on others to prepare and organise the HAZOP. This may be the case if an external consultant has been engaged for the role. In practice the HAZOP will generally run more smoothly and efficiently if the Team Leader has oversight of the whole organisation and is actively involved in planning the time requirements, selecting the team, establishing the support requirements, and developing the terms of reference for the study. This is important because resources are always limited and any inefficiency will reduce the time available for conducting the HAZOP and will inevitably affect the scope covered and/or depth of assessment carried out.

1.2.1.3 Meeting organisation

HAZOP is performed by a group of people working together in a meeting or workshop. The way this meeting is conducted will have a significant impact on the quality of the assessment and output.

The factors that affect a HAZOP meeting are largely the same as any other type of meeting. A shared understanding of objectives amongst attendees, good preparation and time management, strong leadership, and all participants taking an active and pragmatic approach will have positive influences. A suitable venue and equipment will help the meeting to progress and management commitment is essential to ensure attendance of the right people at the right time. Kletz highlighted that adhering to a systematic approach is vital. The meeting must be managed to avoid aimless discussion and straying off on tangents.

**Text Box 1.20**

The complexity of modern plants makes it difficult or impossible to see what might go wrong unless we go through the design systematically. Few accidents occur because the design team members lack knowledge; most errors in design occur because they fail to apply their knowledge. HAZOP gives them an opportunity to go through the design line by line, deviation by deviation, to see what they have missed.

The time required to conduct a HAZOP is often a bone of contention. Kletz tended to take the view that it will take as long as it requires and advocated that the meetings themselves should be limited in their duration and frequency to avoid fatigue of team members and the temptation to rush the HAZOP.

**Text Box 1.21**

A HAZOP usually takes 1.5-3 hr per main plant item (still, furnace, reactor, heater, and so on). If the plant is similar to an existing one it will take 1.5 hr per item but if the process is new it may take 3 hr per item. Inexperienced teams of course, take longer than experienced ones. Meetings are usually restricted to 3 hr, or 2-3 days per week to give the team time to attend to their other duties and because the imagination tires after 3 hr at a stretch. If the members of the team have to be gathered from a distance, longer periods of working, perhaps every morning for a week, may have to be accepted. Resist any temptation to work 8 or more hours per day for a week, as attention inevitably flags. It is the results of a HAZOP that are important, not the number of hours spent on it.

The times proposed by Kletz may have been a bit optimistic because a complicated system such as a reactor might take a lot longer than 3 hr to complete. Using an average of 4-5 hr per P&ID or an average of 3 hr per subsystem may provide a reasonable estimate for planning. However, planning should include input from an experienced team leader who will be able to give more accurate estimates of time, which can avoid arbitrary plans being set based on resources perceived to be available.

The suggestion that HAZOPs should not occupy full, consecutive days remains appropriate and valid. Unfortunately it is a guideline that is often overlooked, particularly in major projects. The problem is that adhering to these restrictions will have a significant impact on schedule. If the HAZOP results in a delay in project delivery it will be very unpopular and the impact that

26

this has on perceptions of the role of process safety and reasonableness of approach may be counter-productive. If the schedule dictates that full and consecutive days are required, then the potential issues with fatigue of team members and hence the quality of the HAZOP output need to be factored into the overall approach being taken to address process safety.

The approach taken by the Team Leader can have a significant effect on how the HAZOP meeting progresses. Kletz identified a range of issues that they need to manage [2]:

**Text Box 1.22**

While the team members have a common objective—a safe and operable plant—the constraints on them are different. The designers, especially the design engineer responsible for costs, want to keep the costs down. The commissioning manager wants an easy start-up. This conflict of interests ensures that the pros and cons of each proposal are thoroughly explored before an agreed decision is reached. However, if the design engineer has a much stronger personality than the other members, they may stray too far towards economy. Other teams may err the other way. The team leader tries to correct any imbalance. To quote Sir John Harvey-Jones, "In industry the optimal level of conflict is not zero."

One of the most common causes of disruption of the team and inefficient HAZOP is spending too much time on discussion of design changes. The HAZOP is not a design meeting. If the solution to an identified problem is not obvious, the Team Leader must quickly guide the team to formulate an action and move on [2].

**Text Box 1.23**

If the team cannot agree, the team leader should suggest that the point is considered outside the meeting. Sometimes a decision is postponed while expert advice is sought—for example, from a materials expert—or even while research is carried out. Sometimes a decision is postponed so that a quantitative estimate of the hazard can be made.

One common failure from HAZOP (and other safety studies) is poorly defined actions. For example:

- Actions that ask people to ‘Consider' an issue without any clear acceptance criteria so that they can be closed without any action taken or any justification;

- Actions that make sense when raised during the HAZOP but on their own are difficult to interpret or are ambiguous outside of the meeting; and

- Actions that are too specific so that they can be closed by a simple design change that does not address more fundamental and wide-ranging issues.

Actions from HAZOPs must be "written sufficiently clearly that the discipline engineers implement the intent of the action; and not just the title" [15]. Sometimes it is not possible to formulate the wording correctly in the workshop and it is usually acceptable for the Team

*"Sir John Harvey Jones was a flamboyant Chairman of ICI and broadcaster."*

Leader and Scribe to have a wash-up session afterwards to finalize details including wording of actions. This should be done very soon after the workshop with any changes communicated to the HAZOP team to allow them to comment.

Overall, it must be recognized that HAZOPs take up significant resources. The people who attend will usually have lots of other work to be done, whether that be progressing the design for a new project or operating an existing facility. Whilst the HAZOP is important, there can be no justification for using time inefficiently due to poor organization and planning. Identifying in advance similar nodes or areas where the HAZOP will become very repetitive can allow for a different approach to be taken to maintain interest and attention of the team so that they will continue to pay close attention and be actively involved.

1.2.2 Accidents that may have been avoided by HAZOP

Although HAZOP has been proven to be effective, nevertheless it is reliant on the people involved. Whilst guidewords can prompt them to think about a range of scenarios, if potential hazards are not understood it is possible that some will not be recognized. Having the right people involved in the HAZOP certainly reduces the risks but this cannot be guaranteed.

1.2.2.1 Abbeystead

Although included in his chapter about accidents that could have been prevented by HAZOP, Kletz highlights that Abbeystead this would only have been the case if someone in the team had the insight to recognize that methane could be present.

Text Box 1.24

At Abbeystead, water was pumped from one river to another through a tunnel. In an incident in May 1984, when pumping stopped, some water was allowed to drain out of the tunnel leaving a void. Methane from the rocks below accumulated in the void and, when pumping was restarted, was pushed through vent valves into a pump house where it exploded, killing 16 people, most of them local residents who were visiting the plant.

If anyone had realized that methane might be present, the explosion could have been prevented by keeping the tunnel full of water or by discharging the vent valves into the open air. In addition, smoking, the probable cause of ignition, could have been prohibited (though we should not rely on this alone). None of these things were done because no-one realized that methane might be present. Published papers contain references to the presence of dissolved methane in water supplies but these references were not known to the water supply engineers. The knowledge was in the wrong place.

Could a HAZOP have prevented the accident? Only if one of the team knew or suspected that methane might be present. He need not have known the details so long as he could recall the fact from the depths of his memory. Good HAZOP team members are people who have accumulated, by experience and reading, a mental ragbag of bits and pieces of knowledge that may come in useful one day. A HAZOP provides opportunities for the recall of long-forgotten bits of knowledge that might otherwise never pass through the conscious mind again.

1.2.2.2 Anhydrous ammonia leak

On 23 August 2010 a release of anhydrous ammonia at the Millard Refrigerated Services facility in Theodore, Alabama resulted in 32 people being admitted to hospital, with four of those requiring intensive care [17]. It happened because pipework failed due to hydraulic shock during the restart of the plant's ammonia refrigeration system following a 7-hour power outage. One of the causes was identified as "the control system contained a programming error that permitted the system to go from soft gas directly to refrigeration mode without bleeding the high pressure from the coil or preventing the low-temperature suction valve from opening. The error with the software logic in the control system went undetected because under normal operations, in its programmed sequence, the defrost cycle would not allow the ammonia liquid to enter the evaporator until the coil was properly depressurized via the bleed cycle."

A HAZOP should have identified that an interruption in the plant's automatic defrost cycle could result in steps occurring out of sequence, some of which would be hazardous. This alone may not have been sufficient to prevent this accident because the cause was a software error. However, the HAZOP may have prevented the accident if the criticality of the software controlled cycle had been fully understood so that it was subject to more scrutiny during its initial programming and any subsequent modification. It is very common, especially for legacy systems, for critical steps to be hidden within software code that is predominantly concerned with normal operations. As a minimum, a functional specification should define all safety critical elements so that they can be actively confirmed as part of initial acceptance tests and during management of change.

1.2.2.3 Heat exchanger rupture caused by High Temperature Hydrogen Attack

In April 2010 a heat exchanger ruptured at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery in Washington State, United States resulting in a fire and explosion. Seven people died [18]. The rupture occurred due to a reduction in the strength of steel caused by High Temperature Hydrogen Attack (HTHA). This occurs at high temperatures when hydrogen is present.

HTHA is a known issue and it is reasonable to expect a HAZOP team to have some awareness. But it only occurs under certain conditions. In this case it was concluded that the exchanger should have operated outside of the region where HTHA was a significant risk, but a HAZOP team member with a more in-depth knowledge may have raised the issue and insisted that the exchanger was subject to postweld heat treatment, which can reduce susceptibility. Also, they may have insisted that active monitoring of the exchanger's operating condition was to be considered critical in order to detect any deviations from the predicted range into a region where HTHA was a risk.

1.2.3 Harnessing available knowledge

The accidents described previously highlight that HAZOP is most effective if knowledge from a range of sources can be harnessed effectively. Kletz highlighted a number of different examples [2]. The first case is a floating roof tank located in a bund, shown in Fig. 1.3.

### Considering the potential for a hose to leak.

The tank contains oil. Rainwater can be drained from the roof into the bund and from there into the main drainage system. Suppose a HAZOP team is considering whether any substance ‘other than' water can get into the main drainage system. For this to occur there would have to be a hole in the hose, and both valves would have to be left open. An inexperienced team might decide that a triple coincidence is so improbable that there is no need to consider it further. However, someone with knowledge of the practicalities of plant operation would realise that during prolonged rain the operators may leave both drain valves open, whatever the instructions say, to avoid frequent visits to the tank. Any hole in the hose will then contaminate the main drainage system with oil.

Kletz used the following example to emphasise the need for specialised knowledge.

A vessel contained liquid sulphur (melting point 120°C). A HAZOP was carried out on the flowsheet; the team considered ‘more of pressure' and decided that the precautions taken to prevent choking of the vent, which included a lute, were adequate. At a later HAZOP of the line diagram, when considering ‘more of temperature', someone pointed out that the viscosity of sulphur rises sharply above about 200°C. This temperature could not be reached in normal operation but could be reached if the vessel was exposed to fire. The sulphur in the lute could then become so viscous that it would prevent relief of the vessel. The relief system had to be redesigned.

A solvent tank was vented through a seal pot. An electric heater was added later. The reason is not stated in the report, but was presumably to prevent freezing in cold weather. The modification was HAZOPed but all the members of the team were chemical engineers; no electrical engineer or representative of the supplier was present. None of the chemical engineers realised that the temperature of the heater could rise above the auto-ignition temperature of the solvent if the liquid level in seal pot was lost.

30

Kletz highlighted the importance of local knowledge [2].

**Text Box 1.27**

During the HAZOP of a batch process the team asked what might be added to the reactor ‘other than' the materials that should be present. The word they actually used was ‘contamination'. Someone pointed out that organic acids could cause a runaway. Further discussion revealed the fact that organic acids were used in another process and were stored in the same warehouse and in the same colour and type of drum as one of the reactants.

Kletz showed how wide-ranging knowledge of what happens including what other people can do can make a big difference in a HAZOP [2].

**Text Box 1.28**

A plant was fitted with blowdown valves which were operated by high-pressure gas. On a cold day, a leak on the plant caught fire. The operators isolated the feed and tried to blow off the pressure in the plant. The blowdown valves failed to open as there was some water in the impulse lines and it had frozen. As a result the fire continued for longer and caused more damage than it would otherwise have done.

How the water got into the impulse lines was at first a mystery. At a HAZOP 2 years earlier, when the plant was modified, the team were asked if water could get into the impulse lines and they said ‘No'.

Occasionally the valves had to be operated during a shutdown, when no high-pressure gas was available. The maintenance team members were asked to operate the valves but not told how to do so. They used water and a hydraulic pump. None of the HAZOP team members, which included the operator shop steward, knew that the valves had been operated in this way.

HAZOPs are only as good as the knowledge and experience of the people present. If they do not know what goes on, the HAZOP cannot bring out the hazards.

**1.3 Limitations of HAZOP**

Although considered to be one of the best tools available, Kletz pointed out that HAZOP has its limitations [2].

**Text Box 1.29**

HAZOP cannot, of course detect every weakness in design. In particular, it cannot draw attention to weaknesses in layout. It will also miss hazards due to leaks on lines that pass through or close to a unit but carry a material that is not used on that unit. This can be overcome by using an additional guide word such as PASSING THROUGH or NEARBY.

HAZOP assumes that the design assumptions are followed during construction and operation. If, say, the wrong material of construction is used or equipment is not tested as assumed, then problems may arise.

result. HAZOP teams may, of course, draw attention to circumstances where special measures should be taken to ensure that the right materials are used or tests carried out, and may question the wisdom of including equipment such as bypasses around trip valves or isolation valves below relief valves.

Fundamentally HAZOP is limited because it analyses system drawings (e.g. P&ID), which are only a representation of some aspects of the system [15].

1.3.1 Poorly executed HAZOP

1.3.1.1 HAZOP as a design review

Kletz identified a common problem where designers assume problems they encounter can be addressed by a HAZOP [2].

Text Box 1.30

Design engineers have been known to say, when someone suggests a change in design, "Don't bother me now. We'll be having a HAZOP later on. Let's talk about it then."

He points out that this is not the purpose of HAZOP and can result in the assessment being compromised because it is side-tracked into design activities, which means hazards and operability problems can be overlooked [2].

Text Box 1.31

This is the wrong approach. A HAZOP is a final check on a basically sound design to make sure that no unforeseen effects have been overlooked. It should not replace the normal consultations and discussions that take place while a design is being developed. A HAZOP meeting is not the right place for redesigning the plant; there are too many people present and it distracts from the main purpose of the meeting which is the critical examination of the design on the table.

1.3.1.2 HAZOP completed too late

A fairly common problem is that HAZOP is done too late in a project. This means that people are reluctant to get involved because they know that if they do identify any problems with the design they will be very difficult and expensive to rectify. This arises when the project is not well managed or the value of HAZOP is not recognised. The study happens because it is a key deliverable that has to be done but gets left to the last minute.

The problem with a late HAZOP is that recommendations for improvements will be mainly restricted to add-on safety protection systems rather than implementing inherently safer solutions. The result is that the hazards remain but the plant complexity is potentially increased due to all the devices being added [19].

1.3.1.3 Short cutting the process

One of the significant challenges for HAZOP is the resources required. It is inevitable that people will try to modify their approach to reduce this burden.

Kletz identified one example where this was done [2].

**Text Box 1.32**

One company has tried to simplify HAZOP by just looking for deviations from its design codes and standards. This may be OK if there is little or no innovation but if there is innovation—and there usually is some—the existing codes may not cover the new circumstances. For example, a hydraulic crane tried to lift a load that was too heavy for the fully extended jib and fell onto the plant: no alarm sounded. The crane was fitted with all the alarms required by the current codes and they were all in working order. However, the codes were written for mechanical strut cranes. Hydraulic cranes have an extra degree of freedom—the length of the jib can be changed—and therefore an extra alarm is needed, but no one had realised this.

One way of short cutting the process is to minimise the amount of analysis conducted in the meeting or workshop. People justify this by saying that their designers are highly competent in both design and HAZOP, and so will have already completed a thorough analysis themselves as they went along. Taken to an extreme this philosophy can lead to a view that HAZOP is not required at all. This is something that Kletz discussed [2].

**Text Box 1.33**

‘We don't need a HAZOP. We employ good people and rely on their knowledge and experience'.

A HAZOP is not a substitute for knowledge and experience. It is not a sausage machine which consumes line diagrams and produces lists of modifications. It merely harnesses the knowledge and experience of the team in a systematic and concerted way. Because designs are so complicated the team members cannot apply their knowledge and experience without this crutch for their thinking. If the team lacks knowledge and experience the HAZOP will produce nothing worthwhile.

‘Good People' sometimes work in isolation. Pegram writes, "working independently, the solving of a problem by one discipline can become a problem of another" and "low cost engineering solutions from one point of view may not necessarily end up as overall low cost." HAZOP ensures that hazards and operating problems are considered systematically by people from different functions working together. Experience shows that start-up, shutdown and other abnormal conditions are often overlooked by functional groups working in isolation.

The opposite of the heading to this section is the belief that good systems can be a substitute for good people. All that systems can do, however, is to ensure that people's knowledge and experience are applied systematically and thus reduce the chance that something is missed. If people lack knowledge or experience (or commitment) then systems such as HAZOP are empty shells. People will go through the motions but the output will be poor. Good people without a system will achieve less than their full potential, but if people lack knowledge and experience the systems will achieve nothing.

In fact, one flip side of involving knowledgeable and experienced people in HAZOP is that they can provide convincing arguments to say an issue is not a major concern because they have seen it happen and the consequences were not significant. In this case the experience is helping to keep the HAZOP moving along at a good pace but introduces the potential for things to be missed, particularly the low-frequency, high-consequence events. Another way that this can happen is if the team get fixated on one or two major hazards, because then they can start to perceive that lesser ones are not worth discussing. But as we know most accidents occur due to a combination of multiple, relatively minor issues and not just one very large one in isolation.

1.3.2 Inappropriate safeguards

It is tempting in a HAZOP to identify a range of existing items as Safeguards or to propose additional items without taking account of what they can reasonably achieve in practice. For example:

- Local instruments which are never checked by field operators and, therefore, could in no way be considered safeguards;

- Alarms which give the operator insufficient time to effectively halt the deviation, because the rate of upset is too fast. Also, alarms that are too generic, activated frequently, or would occur as part of a flood of alarms in the scenario being considered;

- Pressure relief systems for which there is no guarantee that they were designed for the case being studied; and

- Operating procedures, when the cause giving rise to the scenario is human error.

1.3.2.1 Over reliance on people

As with all things in life it is necessary to take a balanced approach to HAZOP, particularly when deciding what safeguards are required and which are not because they would not add additional benefit. When making these decisions it is important to recognise the ability of the people involved in operating the system, but to be realistic about their capabilities and reliability. This can be particularly difficult if experienced operators are involved in the process, if they become protective of their role, as they are likely to find it difficult to believe that they or their colleagues will make the errors that would result in the deviations being discussed. This is often a wider cultural issue caused by operators being unfairly blamed for incidents and other problems experienced. Kletz pointed out that human errors must be considered fully.

Text Box 1.34

Human error should also always be considered as a possible cause of deviations. Thus no flow may be due to someone failing to open a valve. This can occur for a number of reasons.

The operator may not have known the valve should have been opened; the intention was wrong.

We may have to improve training and instructions or simplify the job.

The operator may have decided that it was unnecessary to open the valve at that time or that other tasks were more urgent. We may have to explain the reasons for instructions and make sure they are followed.

The valve may have been too stiff or out of reach. Most likely of all, there may have been a slip or lapse of attention, the intention was correct but was not fulfilled. Everyone has slips and lapses of attention from time to time and they cannot be prevented, though various actions may make them less likely. If the consequences are serious, we should remove or reduce the opportunities for error by changing the design or method of working (or protect people from the consequences or make recovery possible).

There are two fairly common problems that result from a lack of understanding of human factors when carrying out a HAZOP:

- Discounting deviations because it is assumed that competent people who follow procedures will not make errors; and

- Identifying procedures as effective safeguards without specifying exactly what procedure is required and what content is required to ensure that the safeguard is effective.

Although it is possible to take some credit for procedures in a HAZOP the focus must remain on finding design solutions. The HAZOP team have no control over what procedures are provided when the system is operational or the competence of the people who operate, maintain, and manage it.

1.3.2.2 Unrealistic expectations of automated systems

A very common outcome from a HAZOP is a recommendation to include additional trips or Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in the design. Kletz said that this occurs because the HAZOP team perceives this to be a cheap and effective solution, but he pointed out that this was not the case.

Many are solved that way but not as cheaply as we usually think. Testing and maintaining an extra trip costs about as much as purchase and installation, even after discounting. Trips cost twice what we think. In addition, a considerable management effort is needed to make sure that the testing is carried out. Procedures can corrode faster than steel and vanish without trace once managers lose interest. Instead of installing extra trips, it is better to carry out systematic studies earlier in design to find ways of avoiding the hazards.

Another problem is that people assume that automated systems don't fail. Kletz pointed out that this is not correct.

Always consider the failure of automatic equipment as a possible cause of the deviations. For example, no flow may be due to a trip or controller failing to open a valve or closing it at the wrong time.

In fact he recommended that any software used as control needs to be subject to HAZOP [2].

**Text Box 1.37**

On the contrary, it is vital to HAZOP the instructions given to the computer (the applications software) as, unlike operators, the computer cannot recognise and query instructions that are ambiguous, lack precision or are simply wrong. Also, software engineers are rarely also chemical engineers and can easily misunderstand the chemical engineer's requirements.

Another very common issue is that alarms are often specified as safeguards in a HAZOP. This has, in part, contributed to a very serious problem in many industries including process, where alarm systems fail in their key objectives. This is because operators receive far too many nuisance alarms that do not require a response and are overwhelmed by floods of alarms that they have no chance of understanding whenever a system experiences a malfunction or upset. Many companies have identified this issue and are working hard to resolve it [9]. This often includes deletion or modifications to alarms. This can mean that assumptions made during the HAZOP are no longer valid and may call into question the underlying basis of the safeguards assumed in the study.

**1.3.2.3 Overlooking knock-on effects**

To be effective a HAZOP must not only identify issues, but it also should involve some consideration of potential solutions. However, there is a balance to strike because there is unlikely to be sufficient time to fully evaluate any proposed design change. Kletz identified that a failure to consider potential knock-on effects is one particular concern [2].

**Text Box 1.38**

When a change in design (or operating conditions) is made during a HAZOP, it may have effects elsewhere in the plant, including the sections already studied.

For example, during a HAZOP the team decided to connect an alternative cooling water supply to a heat exchanger. The original water supply was clean but the alternative was contaminated, and so the team had to change the grade of steel used for the heat exchanger and connecting lines. It also had to consider the effects of reverse flow in the original lines.

The way actions are worded can have a significant effect on how they are implemented. If they are too prescriptive it is possible that they are implemented without anyone taking the time to fully evaluate the intended and unintended consequences. However, high-level actions to ‘consider' a change are often closed quickly by someone saying that they have considered the issue and decided that no change was required.

**1.3.3 Lack of follow-up**

Of course a HAZOP does nothing on its own to improve safety. It is the actions that result that have this effect.

It is always reasonable for actions from HAZOP (or any study) to be rejected but they should not be ignored. In most cases, a rejection should be justified because another action is identified that can be demonstrated to be more effective. Whilst rejecting an action and doing nothing may be acceptable it should be clearly explained why the risks are considered to be acceptable and ALARP. "It is worse for the company to have a HAZOP and ignore the recommendations than to not have a HAZOP at all" [15].

One practice to be particularly aware of is for actions to be postponed to a later stage in the project [15]. This results in the original action being closed because the people currently involved in the project feel that they are unable to implement a solution. Such an action should only be closed if it has been transferred to another system (e.g. risk register) to ensure that it receives the proper attention at a later time. Alternatively, the action should be ‘deferred' with details for when it needs to be addressed.

One problem with making HAZOP a mandatory activity, either as part of a project or as a planned retrospective review, is that it can become perceived as a ‘tick-box exercise' that people think needs to be done quickly and easily, with the aim of discovering as few issues as possible. This can be partly avoided by ensuring that clear procedures are in place that describe how the HAZOP has to be performed but its importance still needs to be emphasised. Making a senior manager responsible for the final ‘sign off' of the HAZOP report will focus their attention [14]. The responsibility in this regard is to confirm that all actions have been cleared or formally accepted as exceptions and that the HAZOP process has been carried out according to company guidelines by competent people.

1.3.4 Accidents that probably would not have been avoided by HAZOP

Kletz was quite clear that HAZOP cannot prevent every accident [2].

Text Box 1.39

They will not for at least three reasons: (a) Being human, we will not spot everything that might go wrong; (b) People will not always act in the way we have assumed they will; and (c) HAZOP cannot, by its nature, prevent mechanical accidents, such as people bumping into equipment which has been badly located.

Kletz highlighted that the HAZOP team have to assume that a system will be operated and maintained correctly [2].

Text Box 1.40

They assume that the general level of management is competent, that the plant will be operated and maintained in the manner assumed by the design team and in accordance with good management and engineering practice. In particular they assume that protective systems will be tested regularly and repaired promptly when necessary.

If these assumptions are not true then HAZOPs are a waste of time. It is no use identifying hazards or estimating their probability if no-one wants to do anything about them; it is no use installing trip and alarms if no-one is going to use or maintain them. The time spent on HAZOP would be better spent on bringing the safety consciousness of employees and management up to standard.

1.3.4.1 Piper Alpha

The tragedy at Piper Alpha that resulted in the death of 167 people when the offshore oil platform caught fire occurred because hydrocarbon leaked from the location where a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) had been removed for maintenance. Whilst a HAZOP would have identified the PSV as a safeguard against overpressurisation of pipework it would have assumed that it would always be in place whenever hydrocarbon was present.

At its simplest level Piper Alpha occurred due to a leak of hydrocarbon from a pipework joint. It did not particularly matter which joint leaked. The fundamental failures were due to poor management of maintenance and isolations. Whilst HAZOP can highlight the importance of these processes at a general level it cannot consider specific scenarios.

Nonetheless, had a HAZOP been performed on Piper Alpha, it may have identified the need for a HAZOP action to consider ways to mitigate the potential consequences of a vapour cloud explosion, as explained by Kletz as follows [12].

Text Box 1.1

The overpressure from the explosion in the condensate area blew down the fire wall separating it from the section of plant containing equipment to extract crude oil. Containment was breached and there was an immediate and large oil fire. It was that fire and the resultant engulfing of the platform in thick smoke which hampered attempts to escape.

Evidently, in the design stage of the platform, it had been judged that a fire could occur due to a loss of containment in the condensate section. The probability of that happening was sufficiently likely that fire walls were installed between the various sections of the unit. It is difficult to imagine that, in the light of that assessment, an explosion in the condensate area was less likely. Nevertheless, Piper Alpha had no explosion walls either side of the condensate area. However, the more crucial deficiency was that, at the design stage, there had not been a systematic and, where necessary, quantified assessment of the major hazards which could occur on the platform. No hazard and operability review had been made of the design.

1.3.4.2 Buncefield

The fire and explosion at the Buncefield oil storage depot occurred because a tank used to store gasoline was overfilled. This occurred due to operational errors but level instrumentation that would have triggered an alarm when the tank reached a certain level was not functional. A HAZOP would have identified a high level alarm as a safeguard against this accident, and it would have been a reasonable outcome of the study. But the HAZOP team have to assume that, once fitted, the instrumentation would have been maintained in an operational condition. The study could have been used to highlight the importance of the safeguard, but again this could only be at a general level because it would apply to a wide range of instrumentation associated with alarms and trips.

Other types of study such as LOPA may have provided a better insight into the adequacy of instrumentation that only could have caused an alarm without any trip function, but this would still assume that all devices were maintained appropriately.

Alternatively, an inherently safer design study may have identified options to eliminate the potential for the huge vapour cloud explosions by considering alternative options higher.

on the hierarchy of risk reduction techniques, rather than relying on additional layer of protection like level switches and valves which are all prone to failure. The consideration of inherently safer design at Buncefield is included in the Inherent Safety section of this book.

1.4 Practical application

The purpose of this chapter has been to share a range of viewpoints of HAZOP based on what Kletz wrote about and more recent experience by others. This final section provides some additional practical guidance for anyone who may be organising or taking part in a study.

1.4.1 The how and when of HAZOP

Performing a HAZOP requires a fair degree of planning and organisation. Kletz gave us some real insight into some of the issues that need to be addressed in doing this.

1.4.1.1 Involve the right people

Kletz pointed out that HAZOP does not have magical properties and it totally relies on the involvement of people.

Text Box 1.42

Techniques discover nothing; only people discover hazards; techniques can help them do so. HAZOP helps people apply their knowledge and experience, and much of that comes from learning and remembering the lessons of the past.

Kletz discussed whether a HAZOP team should remain the same throughout a study. His view was that changes could occur, especially during longer studies as this would avoid too much HAZOP fatigue. Also, allowing different people to attend meant that the level of understanding and insight into the design, hazards, and potential operational issues would be distributed more widely through a team, which can be beneficial.

Kletz identified that some issues require expert input from people who may not be required to attend a HAZOP for the whole time.

Text Box 1.43

On the contrary, if a plant has specific problems (for example, if corrosion is serious), an expert in these problems should join the team. But do not have experts sitting in the meeting just in case their advice is needed.

Experts can always be on-call. The wide availability of tele- and video conferencing facilities means that they do not need to be local to have an input.

1.4 Practical application

1.4.1.2 Don't leave it to contractors

One concern is for projects where the bulk of the design is performed by third parties. Often the completion of a HAZOP is part of their contract and that can lead to the impression that they should do this alone. Kletz highlighted that this would not be a good idea [2].

Text Box 1.44

Companies have been known to say to a design contractor, "We are under-staffed and you are the experts, so why don't you do the HAZOP for us?"

The client should be involved as well as the contractor because the client will have to operate the plant. The HAZOP gives the client's staff an understanding of the reasons for various design features and helps them write the operating instructions. Even if the client's staff know little to start with about the problems specific to the particular process, they will be able to apply general chemical engineering and scientific knowledge as well as common sense knowledge. Writing in a different context, Pegram says, "... The only effective team is one that owns the problem. The team must therefore comprise the individuals who are responsible for implementing the results of the study, not an external group of experts." The actions agreed at a HAZOP include changes in procedures as well as changes to equipment and, while the contractor is responsible for the latter, the client is responsible for the former.

1.4.1.3 Getting started

Some people feel that they do not need to do HAZOP because they only ever carry out small projects where they (incorrectly) feel that it does not apply. Not only does this mean that the small projects are not given the scrutiny which they require, but it can mean that the company and people are not prepared when a large project comes along. Kletz summed up his views on this [2].

Text Box 1.45

On the contrary, we should start small by applying HAZOP to one or two projects and see if we find it useful. If we do, we can gradually increase our effort until we are HAZOPing all new plants and as many old ones as resources allow.

1.4.1.4 Plant modifications should be HAZOPed

Kletz had concerns that people sometimes feel HAZOP is only intended for new projects and so does not get used for modifications. He summed up his main concern as follows [2].

Text Box 1.46

A modification that has not been thoroughly thought through can result in a chain of further modifications during the subsequent months, possibly in distant parts of the plant.

N. Pegram. The Chemical Engineer Number 482. 1990.

He gave the following further explanation [2].

**Text Box 1.47**

Many people believe that HAZOP is unsuitable for small modifications because it is difficult to assemble a team every time we wish to install a new valve or sample point or raise the operating temperature. However, many accidents have occurred because modifications had unforeseen and unpleasant side-effects. If proposals are not ‘HAZOPed', therefore, they should still be thoroughly probed before they are authorised.

Do not overlook the following modifications:

- Temporary modifications as well as permanent ones;

- Start-up modifications as well as those on established plants;

- Cheap modifications as well as expensive ones; and

- Modifications to procedures, process materials or operating conditions, as well as modifications to equipment.

The requirement to consider a HAZOP should be integral in any Management of Change procedure. It should be very clear in which circumstances it should be mandatory, recommended, or not required.

1.4.1.5 **‘Reasonably practicable' applies**

One concern is that companies are obliged to implement actions arising from HAZOP, even if they are very expensive. Kletz said this was not necessarily the case [2].

**Text Box 1.48**

HAZOP uncovers problems and ways of removing them. If the problems are very expensive to remove and the risks are not intolerable (in the legal phrase, if removing them is not ‘reasonably practicable'), we do not have to remove them. But it is wrong to close our eyes in case we do not like what we see.

What is clear is that making a case for ALARP requires far more than simply rejecting an action because it is expensive. Any rejection of an action should have a fully documented justification, primarily focused on why the risk reduction achieved is not considered sufficient. Ideally, an alternative action should be proposed that addresses the issue raised in the HAZOP and which is more effective and/or less expensive.

1.4.1.6 **Automated HAZOP**

Software for recording HAZOP inputs and outputs is now ubiquitous, but people would like to take this further. Automating the HAZOP process has been researched by a number of groups for many years, but none have succeeded in developing a usable system, perhaps because computers cannot replace the imagination and judgement of a knowledgeable and experienced team. Kletz had some involvement in this and shared his views [2].

Text Box 1.49

Computers are now widely used for recording results and reminding teams of common causes of deviations. Programmes have also been developed, but so far little used, for producing a list of technical problems for consideration. A computer is highly unlikely to be able to identify the problems that arise out of interactions, or failures to interact, between people.

1.4.1.7 Other types of HAZOP

It has been stated that HAZOP is only one method of many that can be used for hazard identification studies. There are some variations on the method that have been developed for specific purposes. Some of the more well known include:

- Batch HAZOP, for batch processes, where the guidewords should be augmented to include phrases such as ‘early', ‘late', ‘before', ‘after', etc.;

- Human or procedures HAZOP—focussed on human errors, their consequences and controls; and

- Software or control HAZOP (CHAZOP)—identification of weaknesses and errors in software.

Studies using these methods can follow very similar approaches taken to standard HAZOP, but will require team leaders and/or team members with the appropriate subject knowledge.

1.4.2 Specific pointers for process HAZOP

Kletz provided us with a lot of things to look out for when carrying out HAZOP in the process industry.

1.4.2.1 HAZOP for vessels

Kletz suggested that vessels sometimes need special consideration during HAZOP [2].

Text Box 1.50

When all the lines leading into a vessel have been studied, the guide word OTHER THAN is applied to the vessel. It is not essential to apply the other guide words to this item as any problems should come to light when the inlet and exit lines are studied. However, to reduce the chance that something is missed, the guide words should be applied to any operation carried out in the vessel. For example, if settling takes place we ask if it is possible to have no settling, reverse settling (that is, mixing), more settling or less settling, and similarly for stirring, heating, cooling and any other operations.

1.4.2.2 Intermediate storage

Kletz's focus on inherent safety led to him saying that "you should have grey hairs, not intermediate storage." Nevertheless, it is often required and it should receive special attention during a HAZOP [2].

42

1. Hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis

**Text Box 1.51**

Pay special attention to intermediate storage vessels. As a rule, no change is supposed to take place there except emptying or filling but changes in temperature or composition may take place, particularly when the contents are allowed to stand for longer than usual.

1.4.2.3 Small branches

Kletz highlighted the potential for HAZOPs to focus on larger items, which sometimes means that apparently less significant items such as small branches can be missed [2].

**Text Box 1.52**

Do not overlook small branches which may not have been given a line number. For example, a tank was fitted with a tundish so that it could be dosed with stabilising chemicals. The effects of adding too much or too little additive (or the wrong additive, or adding it at the wrong time) should obviously be considered during HAZOP but might be overlooked if the team studied only lines with line numbers. (On the other hand, they might have picked it up by considering operations taking place inside a vessel, another example of the way in which HAZOP often gives us a second chance.)

1.4.2.4 Ask about design features

Kletz suggested that the HAZOP was a good time to ask about a range of design features that are not always directly associated with the process [2].

**Text Box 1.53**

The HAZOP also provides an opportunity to check that a number of detailed points have been considered during design. The team should ask:

- What types of gasket have been used? Should spiral wound ones be used? Has the number of types been kept to a minimum? (The more types we use, the greater the chance that the wrong sort will be used.)

- Has the number of types of nuts and bolts, been kept to a minimum?

- Are the valves used of a type, such as rising spindle valves, whose position can be seen at a glance?

- If ball valves or cocks are used, can the handles be fitted in the wrong position?

- Are spectacle plates installed whenever regular slip-plating (blinding) of a joint (for maintenance or to prevent contamination) is foreseen?

- Access is normally considered later in design, when a model of the plant (real or on computer) is available, but the HAZOP team should note any points that need special attention, for example valves that will have to be operated frequently or in an emergency, and should therefore be easy to reach.

1.4.3 Summing up

Kletz shared the following about the potential power of HAZOP [2].

**Text Box 1.54**

Carling has described the effects of using HAZOP in his company. The benefits went far beyond a simple list of recommendations for a safer plant. The interaction between team members brought about a profound change in individual and departmental attitudes. Staff began to seek one another out to discuss possible consequences of proposed changes, problems were discussed more openly, departmental rivalries and barriers receded. The dangers of working in isolation and the consequences of ill-judged and hasty actions became better appreciated. Knowledge, ideas and experience became shared more fully to the benefit of the individual and the company.

Carling's company adopted HAZOP after experiencing several serious incidents. Buzzelli writes: "For an industry so proud of its technical safety achievement, it is humbling to have to admit that most of our significant safety improvements were developed in response to plant accidents."

It does not have to be so. HAZOP provides us with a lantern on the bow, a way of seeing hazards before they wreck our ship.

A publication that reviewed 40 different methods of hazard identification summarised the advantages of HAZOP as follows.

- It is a systematic and comprehensive technique. A detailed plan for performing the technique is available which systematically applies guidewords and parameters to all the pipes and vessels in the process.

- It examines the consequences of the failure. Thought should be given by the assessment team to the consequences of the deviations identified. This aids in the production of recommendations for methods to minimise or mitigate the hazard.

The same study summarised the disadvantages of HAZOP as follows.

- It is time consuming and expensive. Most plants contain a large number of pipes and vessels each of which need to be examined by the application of the various guidewords and parameters.

- It requires detailed design drawing to perform the full study. To fully perform the study the process has to be designed to such a level that all the pipes and vessels are detailed with their operating conditions and control instrumentation.

- Additional guidewords are required for unusual hazards. For specific dangers that will not be covered by the general guidewords, further words (such as radiation for the nuclear industry) will need to be applied.

- It requires experienced practitioners. Experienced team members are required to identify all possible causes and consequences of the deviations, as well as producing realistic recommendations.

- It focuses on one-event causes of deviation only. Only the hazards associated with single deviations can be studied. Hazards that are caused by two or more separate deviations cannot be identified by the technique.

Another study [13] concluded that HAZOP is very beneficial at assuring the ‘conception, configuration and specification' of a system, which leads to improvements in specifications for fabrication, commissioning, operating, and maintaining the plant. But it has many side benefits, including serving as a source of reference for aiding decisions during the system's life, particularly when making modifications and for educating the people involved in a way that helps to improve future design and eliminate cross-discipline conflicts.

HAZOP conducted at design provides the opportunity to avoid high probability, low-consequence events, whilst also ensuring suitable protection is in place against the low-probability, high-consequence events. HAZOPs conducted retrospectively have the advantage of experience that gives a greater insight into problems and the likelihood of escalation into incidents and possibly accidents [13].

HAZOP is one of the few methods for which formal guidance exists. It should not be seen as the only option for identifying hazards, with the chosen method depending on the application and available resources [9].
