## Preface to the First Edition

This book is based on a much shorter one, Cheaper, Safer Plants or Wealth and Safety at Work—Notes on Inherently Safer and Simpler Plants, published by the U.K. Institution of Chemical Engineers in 1984 (second edition, 1985). It dealt only with inherently safer and simpler plants. An extended edition that also considered other ways of making plants more user friendly was published by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation (now part of Taylor & Francis) in 1991 with the title Plant Design for Safety—A User-Friendly Approach. For this new edition, 70% longer than the last one, the title has again been changed, as the phrase inherently safer is now much more familiar to engineers than user friendly. The difference between the two terms is described in Chapter 1. This new edition contains many more examples of inherently safer and user-friendly design and an expanded section (in Chapter 10) on procedures that can be followed to make sure that the subject is considered systematically during design.

Thanks are due to all those who have provided ideas for inclusion in the book or commented on the earlier versions—especially those whose employers wish them to remain anonymous. I would also like to thank those companies that have allowed me to describe accidents that have shown the need for inherently safer and friendlier designs.

The original book was based on lecture notes I had used for teaching inherently safer design to adult students attending short courses in loss prevention and to undergraduate and graduate students in college courses. University departments of chemical engineering may, therefore, find the book useful for teaching the elements of friendlier design. I argue in Section 10.2 that this subject should be included in all chemical engineering courses. The examples in the book can be used as subjects for discussion, participants being asked to suggest better designs. However, the book is intended primarily for process and design engineers, production staff, safety advisers, and research chemists in the process industries. I hope it will encourage them to design inherently safer plants and help them to do so. The book will also interest engineers in other industries and everyone interested in innovation.

As many design engineers have told me, inherently safer design needs more than new information; it needs a change in the way design is accomplished and this will not come about until senior managers are convinced of the need. I hope, therefore, that readers will encourage their senior managers to read the book or, if they cannot do that, to watch the video lecture on inherently safer design that has been prepared by the U.K. Institution of Chemical Engineers. It is available from 165 Railway Terrace, Rugby CV21 3HQ, England.

I have been told that the original work on which this book is based, Cheaper, Safer Plants, was before its time. If so, its time has now come. As will be seen, interest in inherently safer design is substantial and growing. Since the last edition was published, many more people have contributed to the subject and I could not have prepared this new edition without their published and private communications.

Readers in the United States will notice frequent references to The Chemical Engineer (Chem. Eng. [U.K.]), the biweekly magazine of the U.K. Institution of Chemical Engineers, for the publication has consistently reported new developments in the subject of this book. Chem. Eng. (U.S.) refers to the U.S. magazine Chemical Engineering. When no reference is given, the information is usually a private communication from the company or individual concerned.

## Preface to the Second Edition

The principles of inherently safer design are somewhat analogous to the laws of conservation of mass and energy. They have been around for a long time, and they have not changed since they first came into existence. But unlike mass and energy conservation laws, inherently safer design principles have been formalized in the process-safety community for only about the past 30 years. Individual practitioners undoubtedly applied the principles of intensification, substitution, and the like in their projects, but it was Trevor Kletz who first provided a road map for inherently safer design application in the late 1970s. Since that time, the concepts of inherent safety and inherently safer design have matured to the point where their widely acknowledged common sense nature has made them common knowledge. There remains a strong need, however, for books such as the current one to continue moving inherently safer design into the realm of common application and practice.

This second edition of Process Plants: A Handbook for Inherently Safer Design builds upon the first edition by a process of moderate revision of the original text and updating with developments over the past 10 years. New examples are given of application of the fundamental principles of inherently safer design—for this is first and foremost a “how-to” book. Emphasis has also been placed in this second edition on the role of inherent safety in process-safety management systems and in ensuring an appropriate process-safety culture. A comprehensive approach for developing case studies is provided to demonstrate the prevention and mitigation of process incidents by timely incorporation of inherently safer design. Dust explosion risk reduction by means of inherently safer approaches is also addressed. Finally, details on inherent-safety metrics—how to measure the degree or level of inherent safety—are also provided.

Three key features of the original text are also found in this second edition. First, the term user friendly has been retained in addition to the term inherently safer (although the latter appears more predominantly in the updated material included in the current edition). Second, the inherent-safety principles of intensification and of attenuation or limitation of effects have been retained as such rather than renaming them throughout the text as minimization and moderation, respectively. Although these latter labels are perhaps more commonly used in North America, there are advantages to identifying minimization with process intensification and to separating moderation into the concepts of attenuation and limitation of effects. Additionally, the essential character of the first edition is thus retained without diluting its scientific and engineering rigor. The observant reader will notice that in parts of the updated material, the user-friendly idea of simplification has been adopted more as a principle of inherent safety.

The third feature of the original text that has been retained is the use of the first person to refer to the work and thoughts of my coauthor in this second editionTrevor Kletz—who, of course, is the sole author of the first edition. In general, then (with the exception of Section 16.1), “I” and “my” refer to Trevor and his pioneering work in the field of inherently safer design. Readers should, however, be aware of two facts. First, I made the decision to retain this feature because of the high regard in which I hold my coauthor; Trevor had suggested to me that “we” replace “I” throughout the text. Second, in spite of declining his gracious offer, I agree with each and every one of Trevor’s personal observations. How could I not? These are the very points that have shaped my own understanding of what inherent safety means in practice.

The approach taken to revising the first edition has been to incorporate much of the work of my own research team over the past decade. I therefore want to gratefully acknowledge the many graduate students and research assistants who have so wonderfully enriched my knowledge of process safety. In particular, I greatly appreciate the friendship and partnership of Professor Faisal Khan of Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, Canada. I also wish to acknowledge the huge debt of gratitude I owe to my colleagues in industry who have shared with me their valuable and practical insights; many of their examples appear in this second edition.

Ruth Domaratzki was a tremendous help in researching the literature for new examples of inherent-safety application that have appeared since publication of the first edition. She dutifully and cheerfully searched through journals and conference proceedings. Our archival efforts in this regard were directed primarily at the Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, Journal of Hazardous Materials, Loss Prevention Bulletin, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, Process Safety Progress, and Safety Science. Relevant conference papers were identified by a selective review of proceedings from, for example, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers suite of symposia (Annual Loss Prevention Symposium, Center for Chemical Process Safety International Conference, and Process Plant Safety Symposium), Annual Conference of European Safety and Reliability Association, International Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference, International Symposium on Hazards, Prevention, and Mitigation of Industrial Explosions, International Symposium on Loss Prevention and Safety Promotion in the Process Industries, and Mary Kay O’Connor Process Safety Center Annual Symposium.

There are two others without whom this edition would not have been possible. It should be well understood by the reader that this is Trevor’s book. It is his knowledge and skillful writing that I have attempted to emulate with my words and my examples. If this edition helps to advance the field of process safety, and in particular inherent safety, full credit is extended to the lessons so ably taught by Trevor Kletz and to the man himself.

Finally, I would invoke the principle of simplification and say simply: My work on this book is dedicated to my wife, Peggy, without whom nothing in my life is possible.

本质安全的原则在某种程度上类似于质量和能量守恒定律。它们已经存在了很长时间，并且自从它们首次出现以来就没有改变。但是，与质量和能量守恒定律不同，本质安全原则在过程安全社区中仅在过去大约 30 年内得到了正式化。个别从业者无疑在他们的项目中应用了强化、替代等原则，但是 Trevor Kletz 在 1970 年代末首次提供了一个本质安全应用的路线图。自那时起，固有安全和本质安全的概念已经成熟到广泛认可其常识性质使其成为常识。然而，仍然存在强烈的需求，需要像当前这本书一样的书籍继续推动本质安全进入常见应用和实践的领域。

这本「过程工厂：本质安全手册」的第二版在对原文进行适度修订和更新过去 10 年的发展基础上，建立在第一版的基础上。给出了应用本质安全的基本原则的新示例 —— 因为这首先是一本「如何做」的书。在这第二版中，也强调了固有安全性在过程安全管理系统和确保适当的过程安全文化中的作用。提供了一个全面的方法，以开展案例研究，以示范通过及时采用本质安全，预防和减轻过程事故。也解决了通过固有更安全的方法减少粉尘爆炸风险。最后，也提供了关于固有安全性度量 —— 如何衡量固有安全性的程度或水平的详细信息。

1『找到一个核心问题：如何来量化本质安全的程度。（2023-07-21）』

原始文本的三个关键特点也在这第二版中被保留下来。首先，「用户友好」这个术语被保留了，除了「固有更安全」这个术语（尽管后者在当前版本中更新的材料中出现的更为突出）。其次，过程强化的固有安全原则和衰减或限制效应的原则被保留了，而不是在整个文本中将它们分别重新命名为最小化和缓和。尽管这些后者的标签在北美可能更常用，但是将最小化与过程强化相联系，并将缓和分解为衰减和限制效应的概念，还是有其优势的。另外，第一版的基本特征因此得以保留，而没有稀释其科学和工程的严谨性。细心的读者会注意到，在部分更新的材料中，简化的「用户友好」思想被更多地作为固有安全原则采用。

原始文本保留下来的第三个特点是使用第一人称来参考我在这第二版中的合著者 Trevor Kletz 的工作和思想 —— 当然，他是第一版的唯一作者。因此，一般来说（16.1 节除外），「我」和「我的」是指 Trevor 和他在本质安全领域的开创性工作。然而，读者应当注意两个事实。首先，我决定保留这个特点，因为我非常尊重我的合著者；Trevor 曾经建议我在整个文本中用「我们」代替「我」。其次，尽管我拒绝了他的亲切提议，我同意 Trevor 的每一个个人观察。我怎么可能不同意呢？这些都是塑造了我对实践中的固有安全意味着什么的理解的关键点。

修改第一版的方法是将过去十年我自己的研究团队的大部分工作纳入其中。因此，我想表示深深的感谢，对那些极大地丰富了我对过程安全知识的许多研究生和研究助理表示感谢。特别是，我非常感谢加拿大纽芬兰和拉布拉多省圣约翰市纪念大学的 Faisal Khan 教授的友谊和合作。我也希望对那些与我分享了他们宝贵和实用见解的行业同行表示巨大的感激；他们的许多例子出现在这第二版中。

Ruth Domaratzki 在寻找自第一版出版以来出现的固有安全应用的新例子方面提供了巨大的帮助。她尽职尽责、欣然乐观地翻阅了各种期刊和会议论文集。我们在这方面的档案工作主要针对《过程工业损失预防杂志》、《有害物质杂志》、《损失预防公报》、《过程安全和环保》、《过程安全进展》和《安全科学》。通过选择性地审查来自，例如，美国化学工程师研究所的一系列研讨会（年度损失预防研讨会，化学过程安全中心国际会议，和过程工厂安全研讨会），欧洲安全与可靠性协会年会，国际概率安全评估和管理会议，国际工业爆炸危害、预防、和减轻研讨会，过程工业损失预防和安全促进国际研讨会，以及 Mary Kay O’Connor 过程安全中心年度研讨会等处的论文，我们确定了相关的会议论文。

还有两个人如果没有他们，这个版本就不可能实现。读者应该非常明白，这是 Trevor 的书。是他的知识和娴熟的写作技巧，我试图用我的语言和我的例子去模仿。如果这版能够推进过程安全领域的发展，特别是固有的安全，全部的荣誉都归功于 Trevor Kletz 有能力教授的课程以及他本人。

最后，我想引用简化的原则，简单地说：我在这本书上的工作是为了我妻子 Peggy，没有她，我的生活中什么也不可能实现。
