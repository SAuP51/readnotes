## 0501. 空间与他人

0501 Space and other people

Back to Manchester Royal Infirmary, this time in 1976. It's the middle of the night and I'm fast asleep when my pager goes off. I'm a bit more experienced than when I started the bloods that Sunday morning in Chapter 3 , though I'm still a medical student. Now I'm on my maternity attachment. I've been hauled out of bed to repair an episiotomy, the scissor cut into a woman's vagina which a midwife or obstetrician sometimes has to make during delivery. Its purpose is to release tension and minimize the chances of the baby's head splitting important structures such as the mother's anal sphincter. I'd learned to make these cuts when I was delivering babies. Then I found out the hard way that episiotomies are easier to make than to repair.

At that time, students were often called at night to sew up episiotomies, because nobody else wanted to do it. The excitement of bringing a baby into the world has simmered down, and the patient is usually exhausted. Of course, repairing a cut of this kind is crucial for the patient later on. It can have a major impact on a mother's continence and sexual function. I'm painfully aware that I need to get things right, but I'm not sure how.

From the few episiotomy repairs I've seen and done, I know that when I arrive my patient will be in the lithotomy position, her feet in stirrups and her legs splayed. It's undignified and uncomfortable. Gowned and gloved, I'll sit between her legs with a portable operating light shining into her vagina. A nurse will put a sterile suturing pack with instruments, swabs, and small dishes for antiseptic solution onto a trolley next to me. After opening the pack and adding syringes, suture needles and local anaesthetic, the nurse will probably go away and do something else. I'll be left bleary-eyed and uncertain, staring into a dark cavity with blood oozing out, trying to make sense of my patient's anatomy, which won't look anything like the neat diagrams in my textbook. Then I'll have to remember what to do next.

Tonight my patient is Brenda. She's just given birth to Emma, her first baby. It's been a long labour and Brenda's exhausted. All she wants to do is sleep. But first there's her episiotomy to deal with. Shyly I introduce myself, trying to project a confidence I don't feel. ‘Are you the doctor who delivered my baby?' she asks. Embarrassed, I stammer that I'm not yet a doctor, but I've been sent to sew up the cut her midwife had to make.

I take my seat between Brenda's legs, which are covered with green sterile drapes. Now I'm unable to see her face or make eye contact. I try to keep up a conversation, though it's difficult to do that and keep track of the procedure at the same time. I lapse into silence and focus on the task. I clean the perineal wound with antiseptic, then draw up some local anaesthetic and inject it slowly, as I've been shown. Brenda flinches and I realize that I was concentrating so hard on the procedure that I forgot to warn her that I'd be giving her an injection. My fragile confidence shatters and I feel mortified. I'm out of my depth, I can't see the expression of the person I'm talking to and my conversational landmarks have disappeared. Fortunately, this time, the nurse is still standing there. She holds Brenda's hand, tells her what I'm doing – then leaves me to get on with it. I need to suture the episiotomy and keep Brenda's confidence at the same time. How?

再次回到曼彻斯特皇家医院，不过这一次我们来到了 1976 年。当时正是深夜，我正在熟睡，而我的呼机响了起来。虽然我依然是一名医学生，但比起第 3 章开始采血时的我，此时的我经验更丰富一些。我此时正在产科实习。我经常被人从床上叫起来，去修复会阴切开术的伤口 —— 在妇女分娩过程中，助产士或产科医生有时会用剪刀剪开产妇的阴道。这样做的目的是缓解产道压力，减少婴儿头部撕裂重要结构（如母亲的肛门括约肌）的可能性。我在给婴儿接生的时候学过做这样的切口。后来我才发现，做会阴切开术比修复更容易。

那个时候，学生经常会在夜晚被叫去缝合会阴切开术的伤口，因为别人都不愿意做这事。把婴儿带到这个世界上的兴奋已经褪去，而患者通常已经筋疲力尽。当然，修复这种切口对患者以后的生活是至关重要的。它会对母亲的控尿能力与性功能产生重大的影响。我痛苦地意识到我需要把事情做好，但我不确定该怎么做。

根据我见过和做过的几次会阴切开修复术的经验，我知道当我到达时，患者会处于截石位，她的双脚会放在腿架上，双腿张开。这是一个毫无尊严又不舒服的姿势。我穿上手术服，戴上手套，坐在她两腿之间，用便携式手术灯照进她的阴道。护士会把一个无菌缝合包放在我旁边的手推车上，包里有手术器械、棉签和装满消毒液的小碟子。在打开缝合包、准备好注射器、缝合针、局部麻醉剂之后，护士可能会离开去做其他事情。只剩下我一个人，睡眼蒙眬、犹豫不决地盯着一个流血的黑色空洞，试图弄清患者的解剖结构，这和教科书里清晰的图表完全不同。然后我得想起下一步该做什么。

我今晚的患者是布伦达。她刚刚生下来了她的第一个孩子埃玛。这是一次漫长的生产，布伦达已经筋疲力尽了。她只想睡觉，但我们先要处理她的会阴切开术。我怯生生地介绍了自己，试图表现出一种我没感觉到的自信。「你是给我孩子接生的医生吗？」她问。我很尴尬，结结巴巴地说我还不是医生，而是被派来缝合助产士不得不切开的伤口的人。

我坐在布伦达的双腿之间，她的腿上盖着绿色的无菌手术巾。现在我看不到她的脸，也不能做眼神交流。我试着继续聊天，但我很难一边说话，一边注意我正在做的手术。我陷入了沉默，专注于自己的任务。我用消毒液清洗了会阴伤口，然后用注射器抽取了一些局部麻醉剂，慢慢地将麻醉剂注射到她体内，就像别人给我展示的那样。布伦达颤抖了一下，我意识到我太专注于手术，以至于忘了提醒她我要给她打针。我脆弱的信心破碎了，我感到很羞愧。我的处境超出了我的能力范围，我看不见谈话对象的表情，我也不知道该说什么。幸运的是，这一次，护士还站在那里。她握住布伦达的手，告诉她我在做什么 —— 然后让我专心去做。我需要缝合会阴切开术的伤口，同时保持布伦达对我的信心。我到底该怎么做？

### 5.1 准备工作

Developing mise en place

Part of this is about having a system to work with. When I started repairing episiotomies, I would shake the instruments out of their sterile pack and make a start. But each time I needed to pick up the needle-holder or grab another swab, I had to take my eye off my patient as I cast about amongst the clutter. When I looked again, the bleeding point would have vanished from view and I'd be back at square one.

One night, a kindly midwife saw me struggling. She came over and explained how to set things out in a logical sequence, so I could put my hand on what I needed, almost without looking. She asked if I was right- or left-handed, then showed me how to ensure the essential instruments were within easy reach. It made a huge difference, and from then on I laid out each pack in the same order. Eventually this became second nature, and I didn't even register I was doing it. In retrospect, this approach seems so obvious that I can't understand why I didn't realize it from the start. But at the time it wasn't obvious. None of the doctors ever mentioned it – it took someone else to point it out before the penny dropped. Even then, nobody gave it a name.

Years later, I learned that chefs describe this as ‘mise en place', a French expression meaning ‘organizing your workplace'. This is a fundamental principle in the high-pressure world of the restaurant kitchen, where everything depends on split-second timing and flawless coordination.

Mise en place is not just for the kitchen, though. It's how we can get into an unfamiliar car, identify the controls for headlights, indicators and horn, and drive. Yet small departures from what you are used to can still throw you off balance. An unfamiliar mise en place takes time to adjust to. Anyone who's driven a hired car will know how easy it is to find you've turned on the windscreen wipers instead of indicating a turn.

By now you're partway along the Apprentice section of the path towards becoming expert. You're becoming familiar with tools and materials, and you're learning how to read your own body as you work. But becoming expert is not just about tools and materials. It's about the way you interact with the world around you. To flourish within a system, you need to learn how it works and you need to fit in. That's what you do when you're starting.

As a beginner, it's easy to focus on individual tasks without noticing how your workplace is structured. By fitting into a way of working that is already there, you can overlook the importance of your environment. In any system, the materials and tools you work with have already been organized.

Experts don't work on only one task, so their focus is not just on the work in front of them. They have prepared things in advance and know where they've put them. They pay attention to how their workplace is arranged, to where their tools are, to what they will be doing next and how to lay their hands on what they need. Often they share their space with other people, and they have to notice and respect what others are doing. They put things back after using them, and they never use somebody else's tools. It's easy not to register their systematic approach, because it appears to be so effortless.

It was Jozef Youssef who explained to me about mise en place. Jozef is the founder and chef patron of Kitchen Theory , an experimental restaurant in north London which he describes as a design studio with a chef's table. Jozef's passion is what he calls ‘multisensory gastronomy'. If you go there for a meal , you'll experience a succession of unusual courses, each engaging your senses in a different way. Jozef's creations play with vision, touch and hearing, as well as taste and smell. They invite you to see, hear, feel, smell and savour. Jozef only puts on his chef's table once a month, and then only for fourteen diners. The rest of the time he works with schools, industrial partners and academics to widen people's ideas about the world of food. Yet he started with a traditional training.

Like all the experts in this book, Jozef has been through the stages of doing time, using his senses and navigating space – in his case, in the kitchen and front of house. He's worked his way up through the hierarchy of fine dining, spending time in some of the world's leading restaurants. He's earned his stripes in Michelin-starred establishments. But wherever he's worked, mise en place is crucial. Everyone in a professional kitchen has to know exactly where everything is, from their knives and chopping boards to the ingredients for those last-minute touches as a dish leaves the kitchen for a table. Everyone depends on a shared understanding of how this works. Disrupting another cook's mise en place, like using another cook's knife, is a cardinal sin.

The need to be systematic is dinned into culinary students from day one. Mise en place starts with writing down the day's tasks in the order you'll perform them, specifying everything you'll need and making sure you can lay your hands on it at a moment's notice. When you join the ‘brigade' of a professional kitchen, mise en place must have become second nature.

Jozef told me about the thousands of vol-au-vents he prepared at The Dorchester, a leading London centre of haute cuisine. The kitchen team were setting up for a high-profile function several weeks ahead. As Jozef finished making each batch of puff pastry, it was transferred to a freezer to wait for further preparation ahead of the big day, when he'd complete the vol-au-vents. These were just one element of one dish on a menu of five courses. Putting on a massive culinary event like that demands military precision. Remembering exactly where in the cold storage units he'd stored those earlier preparations was part of Jozef's mise en place. He couldn't afford to get it wrong.

Not many people work in Michelin-starred restaurants, but we all need mise en place. Whether we're keeping track of our tools in the garden shed or knowing where the spare light bulbs are in our house, mise en place is how we take the strain off our memory and minimize cognitive load. Anyone who has tried to memorize a string of phone numbers understands the value of an address book. It's the same with physical space.

Experts all develop systems which work for them. Derek Frampton's taxidermy workshop and Andrew Davidson's engraving studio didn't look highly organized to me. I wouldn't have known where they kept things. Yet both of them could lay their hands on whatever tool or material they needed, without even looking. There was a place for everything and everything was in its place; I just didn't know what those places were. Where they recognized order, I saw only clutter.

As a newcomer to their world, I could have easily mistaken their set-up for the absence of any system at all. Someone looking at my writing desk would probably say the same. In both cases, that would be a mistake. These systems represent a distillation of years of experience, of experts having found what works for them.

Part of becoming expert is taking control of your environment. When I see Joshua in his workshop, he has his scissors, thread, tailor's chalk and cloth within easy reach. He and the other experts I've worked with all have their mise en place, though most of them don't use that term. Yet though a systematic approach is expected in almost every area of expert practice, this is seldom explained to novices. As I discovered when I was learning to repair episiotomies, as a beginner you are expected to know all this without being told. If you're lucky, someone helps you. But often no one does.

People often allow the arrangement of their workplace to be dictated to them; they forget they have agency to change it. Kirsty Flower, one of my colleagues at Imperial, told me it was only after years in the laboratory as a postdoctoral molecular biologist that she realized that she was a left-handed scientist working in a right-handed system. Since starting as an undergraduate, she had fitted into a system that was already there. Every time she picked up a pipette, she had to reach awkwardly across her workspace to the specimen bottles on the other side. Because she had always worked like that, it hadn't occurred to her to change her apparatus round. She was focusing on the work, not her system for doing it. Once she rearranged things, her work became much easier.

This highlights a characteristic of the Apprentice phase. You know that everyone else knows more than you, and you want to be part of the group. You don't want to look like an idiot, so you copy other people. But you are only mimicking what you've seen them do. You don't yet understand why or how they do it. So you often miss the finer points that later you'll come to rely on. You seldom have the confidence to shape your workplace, to impose your will on your environment – or even to adjust your chair to suit your height. Like me with my early attempts at episiotomy repair, you work with what you find rather than shaping it to your requirements.

It's easy to work in a mess at home, in your workshop, your kitchen or at your desk, as long as it's your mess. You know your own clutter, you have a sense of where you keep things, and it works for you. If you're working alone, it doesn't matter what your space looks like, as long as you can find what you need the moment you need it. But if you work with other people, there are reasons for maintaining an orderly space. Anyone who works in an open-plan office has had the experience of reaching for the stapler, only to find that someone has borrowed it and not put it back, or that someone has moved the pile of papers you were working on. This explains why sharing a workspace can be so stressful.

Often you only notice mise en place when it's disrupted. When someone comes to stay in your house and helps dry the dishes after supper, you often can't find utensils for weeks afterwards. Your visitors have put things in places that make sense to them but not to you. Objects have been misfiled, as if they were books on the wrong shelf in a library. It's bad enough if you can't find a saucepan. It's worse when you're working in a garage and you can't find the wrench you need because someone else hasn't put it back. In the operating theatre, of course, the stakes are especially high. There, the system for tracking tools is formalized, codified and directed by someone who is expert in exactly that – the scrub nurse.

The scrub nurse is a crucial part of the surgical team, responsible for all the instruments and materials used during an operation. They have to ensure that nothing is left inside a patient after a procedure is completed. Everything has to be counted in and counted out. Working closely with the surgeons, scrub nurses have to be able to lay their hands instantly on whatever instrument is needed and put it back there after use. They have to work within a consistent system that allows a scrub nurse from one theatre to move seamlessly to another. Yet they also customize their mise en place in a way that fits with how they personally like to work.

But the role of the scrub nurse goes far beyond handing over instruments and keeping track of them. Expert scrub nurses are constantly vigilant, paying close attention to the procedure and anticipating what will be needed. Like the highly experienced Sister Ramaphosa at Bara in Soweto, scrub nurses have years of experience. They can teach others in their team a huge amount. They are a crucial part of the community of practice of the operating theatre, using an unspoken language to communicate which even they are often unaware of.

When I did some research using video to analyse long-established surgical teams, I noticed a scrub nurse passing a pair of surgical scissors to the surgeon before he asked for them. Slowing down the film, you could see the surgeon holding out his hand, the nurse placing the scissor handles in his palm, the surgeon closing his fingers and starting to use the instrument, and only then saying, ‘Scissors, please, Sister.' Playing the video for them afterwards, neither the surgeon nor the nurse had any recollection of what had happened. They had worked together for so many years that their actions had become instinctive. Old-school surgeons I worked for would even say, ‘For heaven's sake, Sister, give me what I want , not what I asked for,' relying on that unspoken rapport that only comes from a long collaboration. This is the inheritance of a strong, well-organized mise en place.

要做好这件事，就需要找到一套可行的方法。我开始修复会阴切开术时，我要把无菌包里的器械拿出来再动手。但我每次需要拿起持针钳或另一个棉签时，我都不得不把目光从患者身上移开，在杂物中四处寻找。我再看向患者时，出血点已经从视野中消失了，而我又得从头做起。

一天晚上，一位好心的助产士看到了我的困境。她走了过来，向我解释如何按照逻辑的顺序摆放器械，这样我就能把手放在我需要的东西上，几乎不用低头去看。她问我是右利手还是左利手，然后告诉我如何确保将重要的工具放在触手可及的地方。如此一来，情况大有改观。从那以后，我每次都把无菌包里的东西按同样的顺序摆放。后来，这种习惯成了我的第二天性，我甚至没有意识到自己在这样做。回想起来，这种做法似乎是显而易见的，以至于我不明白自己为什么一开始没有想到。但这一点在当时看来，并没有那么明显。没有一个医生提到过这种做法 —— 直到有人指出来，我才恍然大悟。即便在当时，也没有人专门给这种方法命名过。

多年以后，我发现厨师将这种做法称为「准备工作」，这是一种法国俗语，意思是「整理你的工作场合」。这是在餐厅厨房这种高压环境里的一项基本原则。在那里，一切都取决于稍纵即逝的时机和完美的协调配合。

不过，「准备工作」并不只适用于厨房。我们进入一辆陌生的汽车时也会这样做：找到前灯、转向灯、喇叭的控制器，然后再开始驾驶。然而，如果真实情况与你的习惯有微小的偏差，依然会让你感到有些不适应。不熟悉的「准备工作」需要你花一些时间去适应。任何租过车的人都知道，想打开转向灯却误打开雨刷器是多么常有的事。

到现在为止，在成为专家的道路上，你已经走完了学徒阶段的一半。你对工具和工作对象越来越熟悉，你也在学习如何在工作中读懂自己的身体。但是，成为专家不仅与工具和工作对象有关，其重点在于你与周围世界的互动方式。要在一个系统中蓬勃发展，你需要了解这个系统是如何运作的，你需要融入其中。这就是你在开始时需要做的。

作为一个初学者，你很容易将关注点放在个人的任务上，而忽视了你工作场所的结构。你已经适应了既有的工作方式，可能会忽视环境的重要性。在任何系统里，你要处理的工作对象与工具都已经被整理好了。

专家不会只专注于一项任务，所以他们的关注点不会只放在眼前的工作上。他们会提前准备好各种事物，知道它们应该放在哪里。他们会关注工作场所是如何配置的，他们的工具在哪里，他们接下来要做什么，以及如何获取自己需要的东西。他们经常与他人共享自己的空间，他们必须注意并尊重他人的所作所为。他们用完东西就会放回原处，从不使用别人的工具。他人很难注意到专家的严谨周密的工作方法，因为他们的方法看上去毫不费力。

约瑟夫·优素福（Jozef Youssef）向我解释了「准备工作」。约瑟夫是「厨房理论」餐厅的创始人和老板，那是一家位于伦敦北部的实验性餐。约瑟夫称「厨房理论」是一间有着料理台的设计工作室。约瑟夫的激情是他所谓的「多感官美食」。

如果你去那里用餐，你会体验到一系列不同寻常的菜肴，每道菜都会用不同的方式吸引你的各种感官。约瑟夫的菜肴除了调动你的味觉和嗅觉以外，还会调动视觉、触觉和听觉。它们会邀请你去看、去听、去感受、去闻、去品味。约瑟夫每个月只下一次厨，并且只给 14 位食客下厨。在其余时间里，他会与学校、行业合作伙伴和学者合作，拓宽公众对于食品世界的看法。

然而他在一开始接受的是传统的烹饪训练。就像本书中的所有专家一样，约瑟夫也经历了积累、运用感官、在空间内摸索的阶段 —— 在他的例子里，他的空间是餐厅的厨房和前厅。他在高档餐饮领域内努力向上攀登，在一些世界顶尖的餐厅工作过。他曾在米其林星级餐厅积累过经验。

无论他在哪里工作，「准备工作」都是至关重要的。在专业厨房里，人人都必须知道每样东西的确切位置 —— 从菜刀到案板，再到菜肴离开厨房摆上餐桌前最后一刻要用到的调料。每个人都依赖于对这套工作制度的共同理解。干扰其他厨师的「准备工作」，就像使用其他厨师的菜刀一样，是一种大忌。

烹饪学生从第一天起就被灌输了这种井井有条的需要。「准备工作」始于按顺序写下当天的任务，详细列出你需要的所有东西，确保你可以随时拿到它们。当他们加入专业厨房的队伍时，「准备工作」已经成了他们的第二天性。

约瑟夫跟我说过他曾在多切斯特酒店餐厅制作过成千上万个酥皮馅饼。多切斯特酒店餐厅是伦敦首屈一指的高级烹饪中心。当时厨房团队正在为几周后的一项备受瞩目的活动做准备。约瑟夫每做完一批酥皮，就把它们放进冰箱里，等到大日子到来之前再做进一步的加工，他会在那时做好酥皮馅饼。这只是五道菜中的一道菜里的一个要素。举办这样的大型烹饪活动需要军事行动一般的精确调度。准确记住他事先准备好的酥皮放在冷藏室的什么位置，是约瑟夫的「准备工作」的一部分。他决不能出错。

在米其林星级餐厅工作的人并不多，但人人都需要「准备工作」。无论我们是要记住花园小棚里的工具摆放位置，还是弄清家里备用的灯泡在哪儿，「准备工作」都是我们减轻记忆压力，尽可能减少认知负荷的方法。任何一个试图记住一连串电话号码的人，都明白号码本的价值。同样的道理也适用于物理空间。专家都会发展出适合自己的系统。在我看来，德里克·弗兰普顿的标本剥制工坊和安德鲁·戴维森的雕刻工作室并不是很有条理。我不知道他们把东西都放在哪里。然而，他们两人甚至不用看就能拿到他们需要的任何工具或工作对象。每样东西都各就各位，每样东西都在该在的地方。只是我不知道那些地方在哪儿。他们眼中的秩序，在我看来是混乱。

我作为一个刚刚进入他们世界的新人，很容易会误以为他们的布置杂乱无章。别人看见我的写字台可能也会说同样的话。在这两种情况下，这都是不正确的。这两种系统都是多年经验的结晶，是专家找到适合自己的方法的结果。

成为专家的一部分在于控制你的环境。我在约书亚的工作室里见到他时，他的剪刀、线、裁缝用的粉笔和布料都触手可及。他与和我打过交道的其他专家都有自己的「准备工作」，不过他们大多数人都不会使用这个术语。然而，尽管几乎在所有专业实践领域内，都需要一套系统性方法，但很少有人把这一点解释给新手。正如我在学习修复会阴切开术时发现的那样，作为一个初学者，大家不会告诉你这些，却希望你知道这一切。

如果你幸运的话，有人会帮助你，但通常没有人这么做。人们常常听任别人安排自己的工作场所，他们忘记了自己拥有改变环境的能动性。我在帝国理工学院的同事柯丝蒂·弗劳尔（Kirsty Flower）告诉我，直到在实验室做分子生物学博士后的数年之后，她才意识到自己是一个在右利手系统中工作的左利手科学家。从上大学开始，她就融入了一个既有的系统。

每次拿起移液管，她都得笨拙地伸手越过工作空间，去拿另一边的样本瓶。她一直都是这样工作的，所以她从没想过改变身边的器具布置。她专注于工作，却因此没有注意她所处的系统。

一旦她重新布置了各种事物，她的工作就容易多了。这个例子凸显了学徒阶段的一个特点。你知道其他人比你懂得多，而你想成为团队的一员。你不想看起来像个傻瓜，于是你模仿他人。但你只是在模仿你看见他们所做的事情。你还不明白他们为什么这样做，也不知道他们是怎样做的。所以你常会忽略以后需要依赖的细节。你很少会有信心去改造自己的工作场所，把自己的意志施加于环境 —— 甚至不敢调整椅子以适应你的身高。就像我当初尝试做会阴切开修复术一样，你会去适应你看到的环境，而不会按照自己的需要来改造环境。

在家里、工坊里、厨房里或书桌上的混乱中工作是很容易的，只要这是属于你的混乱。只要你对自己的杂物了如指掌，知道你把东西都放在哪里，那种布置就适合你。如果你独自工作，你的空间看起来如何并不重要，只要你能在需要的时候找到需要的东西就好。但如果你和其他人一起工作，就应该保持空间的有序。任何在开放式办公室工作过的人都有这样的经历：当你伸手去拿订书机，却发现有人把它借走了，而没放回去；或者有人动了你在处理的一堆文件。这就是为什么与他人共用工作空间可能会给人带来很大的压力。

通常只有在被打乱的情况下你才会注意到「准备工作」。如果有人到你家做客，在晚餐后帮你擦碗，你常常在之后的几周里都找不到餐具。你的客人把东西放在了他们觉得合适的地方，但你觉得不合适。东西放在不合适的地方，就像图书馆的书被放在了错误的书架上。找不到平底锅就已经够糟糕了。更糟的是，你在车库工作，却找不到需要的扳手，因为别人没有把它放回原处。当然，在手术室里，这样做的风险特别高。在那里，有一套制度规定工具该放在哪里，这套制度由专门从事这方面工作的人员制定、实施和管理 —— 这些人就是洗手护士。

洗手护士是外科团队的重要组成部分，负责手术过程中的所有器械和材料。他们必须确保在手术结束后，没有任何东西留在患者的体内。每样东西的进出都要有数。洗手护士与外科医生密切合作，他们必须能够立即把手放在任何需要的器械上，并且在使用后将其放回原位。他们必须按照一个固定的流程工作，这样洗手护士在任何一个外科手术团队中都能顺利工作。然而，他们也得按照自己喜欢的工作方式来做自己的「准备工作」。

但是，洗手护士的任务远不止递出和收好器械。专家级的洗手护士会时刻保持警惕，密切关注手术过程，并预测接下来需要做什么。就像索韦托巴拉瓜纳医院里经验丰富的拉马福萨护士一样，洗手护士有多年的工作经验。他们可以教给团队里的其他人很多东西。他们是手术室实践社群的重要组成部分。他们会用一种无声的语言交流，甚至连他们自己也没有觉察到。

我用视频分析合作多年的手术团队时，注意到一名洗手护士在外科医生要求之前就把手术剪递给了他。慢放视频，你可以看到外科医生伸出手来，护士把剪刀把手放在他的掌心，外科医生的手指合拢，开始使用器械。直到那时他才说：「护士，剪刀，谢谢。」事后我给这个团队播放视频时，外科医生和护士都不记得发生了什么。他们在一起工作了许多年，他们的动作都成了本能。我曾在一些老派的外科医生手下工作过，他们甚至会说：「看在上帝的分儿上，护士，把我心里想的东西给我，而不是我开口要的东西。」他们很依赖那种只会来自长期合作的默契。这是一种高效的、极有条理的「准备工作」带来的结果。

### 5.2 制作羽管键琴

Making a harpsichord

Joining an organization or working in a group allows you to benefit from having a mise en place that has developed over several years – or even, as in the case of surgery, over centuries. But if you've ever tried to teach yourself something without the help of others, you're likely to have suffered from having to build your own mise en place without the requisite context.

I learned the piano as a child, though not very well. I've always loved baroque music, and for years I had a yen to play the harpsichord. When I was a GP, I thought I'd take the plunge and get one. But harpsichords are expensive and I couldn't justify buying one before I knew if I'd like playing it. My compromise was to build one myself from a kit. Even a kit was almost more than I could afford, and would involve uncertainty and risk. I had no idea if I could even finish it.

After a lot of research, I decided on one made by John Storrs. He had trained as an engineer before going into musical instrument design, and he used that background to ensure that the mission-critical parts of the harpsichord assembly were foolproof – the spacing of the strings, the holes in the wrest plank for the tuning pins, those parts where a hair's breadth of error would result in an unplayable instrument. The parts that required endless patience but limited ability – assembling the jacks and fitting their horsehair bristles; sanding down ebony and bone keys; scraping plectra – he left to each customer.

The kit was based on a seventeenth-century instrument by Hans Ruckers, a famous Flemish maker. It arrived at my house in boxes. We had a small house, so I evicted our younger daughter from her tiny bedroom and turned it into a temporary workshop. There were two slim instruction booklets, one of words and the other of diagrams.

My main problem with building that instrument was that I had no idea what I was aiming for. I had to interpret instructions written by someone who already knew what I didn't. I had no one to help me recognize thin materials on the verge of collapse, no one to advise me about mise en place.

Although a harpsichord is quite small – much shorter than a grand piano, a fraction of its weight and with fewer notes – a lot goes on under the bonnet. The instrument I was making had three strings for each key. Each of those strings has its own jack: a thin slip of wood that sits on the far end of the key and plucks the string with a plectrum when you press down on the key. Each plectrum is seated in a tiny pivoted tongue in the jack, allowing it to pluck the string on the way up but slide silently past it on the way back. The damper, a small square of red felt, fits into a groove in the side of each jack and stops the string sounding once you release the key. It all has to be minutely adjusted.

There were almost two hundred of these jacks. Each of the steps – fitting the tongue, filing a tiny groove for the hog's hair bristle, cutting the damper felts, inserting the plectra – had to be done almost two hundred times, and each involved a new learning curve. Again and again I went from cack-handed ignorance to weary familiarity – that cycle of doing time.

The only way I could keep track of these minuscule parts was by developing my own mise en place. In my daughter's tiny bedroom, I was working in a cramped space. My tray of tools wasn't much bigger than the trolley of instruments I'd used when I was a medical student suturing Brenda's episiotomy after she'd given birth to her baby Emma. I needed a similar sense of order.

A big problem was that I was working alone. I wasn't in a workshop surrounded by other apprentices. All I had were the components of the harpsichord I was going to assemble. I didn't have access to an inherited mise en place, the collective knowledge of generations of harpsichord builders or the shared wisdom of a group. There was no community of practice for me to fit into. I didn't even have an example of a harpsichord to refer to. All I could do was follow the sets of written and illustrated instructions. Most challenging of all, I didn't have a sense of what to expect. I tackled the project one stage at a time, not knowing how all the elements would fit together. Those instruction booklets were a map, but I had no guide.

Gradually, I started to get the hang of things. By the time I'd cut my umpteenth red felt damper, put the finishing touches to yet another ebony key slip, or wound another string from a coil of brass wire, I was becoming comfortable in my workshop and developing my ‘mechanic's feel'.

Anyone who has embarked on a project will have experienced something similar. You have to think through the components you're going to need so you can put your hand on them quickly. Sometimes the challenges are physical, like repairing an engine, suturing an episiotomy or building a harpsichord. Sometimes they are more conceptual, like writing an essay or a book, where you need access to information you've researched and references you'll cite. Whatever your field, you need to organize your workspace. But workspace is only part of the picture.

加入一个组织或在一个团队里工作，可以让你从多年来形成的「准备工作」习惯中受益 —— 在外科的例子里，这种习惯经历了几个世纪的发展。但是，如果你曾经尝试自学而没有别人的帮助，那你可能会因为不得不在没有必要环境的情况下形成自己的「准备工作」而遇到困难。

我小时候学过钢琴，不过弹得不是很好。我一直喜爱巴洛克音乐，多年来一直渴望弹奏羽管键琴。在我做全科医生的时候，我曾想冒险一试，买一台来弹。但是羽管键琴很贵，在知道自己是否喜欢弹奏之前，我实在是没有足够的理由去买。我采取了一条折中的道路：自己动手用组装包做一台。即便是一套组装包也几乎超出了我的消费能力，而且会涉及不确定性和风险。我甚至不知道自己能不能完成这件事。

经过大量研究，我决定使用约翰·斯托尔斯（John Storrs）制作的组装包。在进入乐器设计领域之前，他接受过工程师的训练。他利用这种知识背景来确保羽管键琴的关键组成部件万无一失 —— 琴弦的间距、弦轴板上用于固定弦轴的孔，这些部分有一点点偏差，就会导致乐器无法弹奏。那些需要无尽的耐心，但不需要很高能力的部分 —— 组装顶杆，再给顶杆装上马鬃弹簧，打磨乌木和骨质琴键，刮制弦拨，他把这些工作留给顾客来做。

这套组装包是根据著名的佛兰德斯制造商汉斯·鲁克斯（Hans Ruckers）于 17 世纪制作的一台羽管键琴设计而成的。这套组装包分了好几个箱子送到我家。我家当时的房子很小，所以我把小女儿从她的小卧室里赶了出来，把她的卧室变成了一个临时工坊。组装包里有两本薄薄的说明书，一本是文字，另一本是图表。

欧洲历史地名，泛指今天法国西北部、比利时西部、荷兰南部等地。—— 译者注

我组装这个乐器的主要问题在于，我不知道我的目标是什么。我必须读懂说明书，说明书的作者知道一些我不知道的东西。没有人帮助我分辨脆弱的工作对象何时会濒临崩溃，也没有人建议我该怎样做「准备工作」。

尽管羽管键琴很小 —— 比三角钢琴短得多，也轻得多，琴键也少，但琴盖下的东西很复杂。对于我要制作的这个乐器来说，每个琴键都有三根弦。每根弦也都有自己的顶杆 —— 也就是一片薄木片，安装在琴键的另一端。当你按下琴键时，顶杆就会用弦拨拨动琴弦。每个弦拨都位于顶杆上的一个小小的、能够转动的拨舌上，这样弦拨就能在上升的过程中拨动琴弦，在返回原位时安静地掠过琴弦。制音器是一小块方形的红色毛毡，嵌在每个顶杆侧面的凹槽里。一旦你松开琴键，制音器就会让琴弦停止发声。这些都需要经过细微的调整。

一共大约有 200 个这样的顶杆。每个步骤（安装拨舌、为安装马鬃弹簧锉出一道小小的凹槽、切割制音器、插入弦拨）都得重复大约 200 次，每一次都有新的心得。通过一遍又一遍的重复，我的感觉从一无所知的笨拙变成了令人厌倦的熟悉 —— 这就是积累的过程。

我能找到这些微小零件的唯一方法，就是学会做「准备工作」。在女儿的狭小卧室里，我在拥挤的空间里工作。我的工具托盘并不比我在学生时代给生下宝宝埃玛的布伦达缝合会阴切开术的伤口时所用的器械推车大多少。我需要这种类似的秩序感。

一个大问题是，我此时在独自工作。我不是在工坊里，身边也没有其他学徒。我只有需要组装的羽管键琴零件。我不懂这个领域传承下来的「准备工作」，也没有几代羽管键琴制造者的集体知识，没有群体的共同智慧。没有能够让我融入的实践大社群。我甚至连可供参考的羽管键琴的样例都没有。我只能按照一套图文说明书的指示来做。最具挑战性的是，我不知道接下来会发生什么。我只能一次一个阶段地完成这个项目，不知道所有元素该怎样结合在一起。这两本说明书就像一张地图，而我没有向导。

渐渐地，我开始掌握要领。当我剪裁了无数个红色毛毡制音器，又给一块乌木琴键做完最后的修饰，或者再次用一卷铜线缠绕出一根琴弦时，我在我的「工坊」里越来越得心应手，产生了「机械师的感觉」。

任何开始做一件新事情的人都会有类似的经历。你必须想清楚你需要的各种「零件」，这样你就能迅速找到它们。有时你面临的挑战是身体上的，比如修理引擎、缝合会阴切开术的伤口或制作羽管键琴。有时挑战是概念上的，比如写一篇论文或一本书，这时你就需要找到你研究过的信息和你将要引用的参考文献。无论你的领域是什么，你都需要整理好自己的工作空间。不过工作空间只是一个方面。

### 5.3 个人空间与他人

Personal space and other people

As I assembled that harpsichord at home, I could arrange my workshop as I wanted it. I could design my own mise en place. I didn't get that design right first time, but the only person who suffered from my mistakes was me. But in my medical work, I was sharing space with my patients. Often I needed to examine them, to look at them closely and touch their bodies. This isn't a straightforward process, as I have discovered several times when the roles have been reversed and I've become a patient.

When I started working in London, I bought a motor scooter. One summer evening I was riding home with my visor up when something hit me in the face. I didn't know what it was, but I felt liquid trickling down my cheek and my vision in one eye was blurred. I thought the liquid might be toxic or corrosive, and I was terrified. I went straight to my local eye hospital. First I was seen by a junior ophthalmologist. He seemed as anxious as I was. Though he did all the right things clinically, this doctor's examination made me feel very uncomfortable. He put his face close to mine without any warning, shone a bright light in my eye, then turned my upper eyelid inside out and examined my eye with a slit lamp. I flinched and moved about, and the experience was unpleasant for us both.

Half an hour later I saw the consultant. The experience was completely different. She glided effortlessly into my personal space, unhurried and gentle. Although she did the same things as the trainee – shining a bright light, everting my eyelid, using a slit lamp – she did them in a different way. I felt confident, at ease, happy to let down my barriers and allow her in. Fortunately, it turned out that the liquid was water, and although there was some damage to my eye it recovered in the following weeks. But I've never forgotten her approach. To me, she demonstrated mastery.

Many of the experts in this book work at close quarters with other people. There's a special skill to entering someone else's personal space, that buffer zone which is bounded by an invisible ‘second skin'. This notional space is different for each of us, and our brains continually reconfigure it depending on the social context. The rules and expectations for being comfortable when a stranger approaches you are complex. Shaking hands with someone you've never met is acceptable; holding hands is not.

Some experts – like doctors, dentists, opticians, physiotherapists, osteopaths and massage therapists – work with people's bodies all the time. Bodies are these experts' primary material, their equivalent of the potter's clay, the cabinetmaker's wood or the sculptor's stone. Other experts – like barbers, hairstylists, beauticians, tattoo artists and body piercers – do something similar, though in a non-clinical setting. Tailors, corset-makers and hat designers work with people's bodies at one remove, creating clothes that can be put on and taken off. Others, such as restaurant waiters, close-up magicians and theatre performers, work in people's personal space without touching them at all. Experts in all these fields develop a confidence that you hardly notice.

That sense of ease is characteristic of experts who work with precious materials, whether people or things. It often astonishes me to see a violin virtuoso tuning up before a performance. Even when the instrument is a priceless masterpiece – a Stradivarius or a Guarneri – she will handle it with supreme confidence. She places it gently between her chin and shoulder, taking both hands away before turning the tuning pegs at the end of the violin. Anyone else would be terrified of dropping the instrument in the tension of the moment, but these experts are secure in their mastery. Working with people requires a similar confidence – respectful yet assured.

The neuroscientist Michael Graziano has been working on personal space for decades. He begins his 2018 book, The Spaces Between Us , like this:

We all have an invisible, protective bubble around us. Personal space, margin of safety, bad breath zone, duck-and-flinch buffer – whatever you call it, we have it constantly switched on like a force field. It comes in layers, some layers close to the skin like a bodysuit, others farther away like a quarantine tent. Elaborate networks in the brain monitor those protective bubbles and keep them clear of danger by subtly, or sometimes drastically, adjusting our actions. You walk through a cluttered room weaving effortlessly around the furniture. A pigeon swoops past your head in the street and you duck. You stand a little farther from your boss than from your friend, and much closer to your lover. Usually hidden under the surface of consciousness, occasionally rising into awareness, personal space affects every part of human experience.

Graziano points out that initial notions of personal space as a ‘second skin' developed in the 1960s as a psychological and social phenomenon. Edward T. Hall's The Hidden Dimension , published in 1966, put forward the notion of ‘proxemics', the author's way of interpreting ‘man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture'. Hall was building on the work of Heini Hediger, a pioneering animal biologist who developed the field of ‘zoo biology' – the science of wild animals kept in human care.

Hediger, who was the director of the Zurich Zoo, showed that animals in their natural environment live within relatively small bubbles of territory which they take with them when they move. He described different interaction distances between animals. For example, flight distance is the distance an animal will tolerate when confronted by a member of a different species before fleeing. Critical distance is the narrow zone separating flight distance from attack distance (when an animal being pursued will turn and go on the offensive). Personal distance and social distance relate to interactions between animals of the same species. These determine the normal spacing that animals maintain between themselves and others in their group.

Hall's insight was to apply these observations to humans. Although flight distance and critical distance have been largely eliminated, personal and social distance remain. He put forward four categories of distance – intimate, personal, social and public. These distances are not fixed but change with context. They delineate an exclusion zone, a region in which you don't want other people. Hall put it like this: ‘it is in the nature of animals, including man, to exhibit behaviour which we call territoriality. In so doing, they use the sense to distinguish between one space or distance and another. The specific distance chosen depends on the transaction; the relationship of the interacting individuals, how they feel, and what they are doing.'

Since the 1980s there has been an explosion of interest in personal space in the world of experimental neuroscience. It turns out that the space surrounding the body has a special representation in the brain. Graziano's own experimental work, first with monkeys and more recently with humans, demonstrates a highly complex set of specialized ‘multisensory' neurons which allow us to keep track of the location of things, even in the dark. He has shown how sets of behaviours – documented first with animals and their territories, then by social observation of humans – turn out to have a neuroscientific basis that is only now beginning to be unravelled. Graziano writes of a ‘simulated bubble wrap', an invisible second skin surrounding the body that emphasizes nearby space while also registering what happens further away. But unlike Hall's original concept, there is no single giant envelope of space around the body. Every body part seems to have its own bubble. This system allows us to keep track of objects through sight, sound, touch and even memory. It depends on a well-defined set of brain areas and specialized neurons that have elegant properties. The result is to weld our senses together into a visual-auditory-tactile radar for nearby objects.

But our mechanisms for personal space don't only apply to people – we extend our peripersonal buffer zone around our tools as well. That's how we can use a fork or a screwdriver to ‘sense' what it is doing and interpret the space around it. Using the example of a vacuum cleaner, Graziano explains how a person monitors the spaces around the entire wand ‘to make sure it doesn't crash into furniture or doorways and knock over vases, injure the cat, or bruise your own legs'. To use a tool competently, he points out, you must process the space around it. It seems that our brains incorporate the tool into a body schema, creating a modifiable margin of safety that can be extended around a foreign object.

This helps to understand the importance of mise en place – the need for an ordered and familiar environment where much can be taken for granted. In such a set-up, we have reconfigured our peripersonal buffer zones so we can use our energy for the work in hand rather than trying to make sense of the space around us.

当我在家里组装羽管键琴时，可以随心所欲地安排我的「工坊」。我可以设计自己的「准备工作」。虽然我第一次的设计不太合理，但为错误承担后果的人只有我自己。可是在我的医疗工作里，我和患者同处于一个空间。我常常需要给他们检查身体，仔细观察并触摸他们的身体。这不是一个简单的过程，在角色互换、我成为患者的时候，我多次发现了这一点。

刚开始在伦敦工作的时候，我买了一辆摩托车。一个夏天的晚上，我骑车回家，但没有放下头盔的护目镜。突然有什么东西撞上了我的脸。我不知道那是什么，但我感觉有液体从脸颊上流下来，一只眼睛的视线模糊了。我觉得这种液体可能有毒或有腐蚀性，我吓坏了。我直接去了当地的眼科医院。首先来看我的是一位眼科实习医生。他似乎和我一样焦虑。虽然这位医生做的所有事情在临床上都是对的，但他的检查让我很不舒服。他毫无预兆地把脸凑近我的脸，用强光照射我的眼睛，然后翻起我的上眼睑，用裂隙灯检查我的眼睛。我畏缩了一下，忍不住扭动起来，这对我们来说都不是一次愉快的经历。

半小时后，我见到了顾问医师。这次的感觉大不相同。她毫不费力地进入我的个人空间，从容又温柔。虽然她做的事情和那位实习医生一样 —— 打开强光，翻开我的眼睑，使用裂隙灯，但她做的方式不一样。我感到有信心、放松、愿意放下防备、接纳她。幸运的是，那种液体原来是水。尽管我的眼睛受了一些损伤，但在接下来的几周内恢复如初了。不过我从未忘记顾问医师的做法。在我看来，她展现出了高超的技艺。

本书中的许多专家都要与他人近距离地工作。要进入别人的个人空间，有一种特殊的技巧。个人空间是一种缓冲区，周围环绕着无形的「第二层皮肤」。这种假想的空间对我们每个人来说都是不同的，我们的大脑会根据社会情境不断地调整这个空间。在陌生人接近你时，让你感到舒服的规则和期望是复杂的。与从未谋面的人握手是可以接受的，牵手则不是。

有些专家（如牙医、眼科医生、理疗师、整骨师和按摩师）一直在和他人的身体打交道。身体是这些专家的主要工作对象，相当于陶艺师的黏土、家具木工的木材或雕塑家的石头。还有些专家（如理发师、发型设计师、美容师、文身师和身体穿孔师）做的事情也很类似，但是在非临床的情境里。裁缝、束身胸衣制作师、帽子设计师间接地与人体工作，制作可以穿脱的衣物。还有一些人，如餐厅服务员、近景魔术师、戏剧演员，他们在别人的个人空间里工作，但完全不会触碰他人。所有这些领域的专家都有一种你几乎觉察不到的自信。

对于那些与宝贵的工作对象工作的专家来说，这种从容是他们的特点，无论他们的工作对象是人还是物。有一名小提琴演奏家在演出前调音的样子常常让我感到惊讶。即使手中的乐器是无价的珍宝，如斯特拉迪瓦里（Stradivarius）或瓜尔内里（Guarneri）这样的名琴，她也能非常自信地摆弄它。她会轻轻地把琴放在下巴和肩膀之间，松开双手，然后再去转动小提琴琴头的调音弦轴。其他人会害怕在那一刻的紧张中失手，把乐器摔下来，但这些专家对自己高超的技艺很放心。与他人一起工作需要相似的自信 —— 保持尊重而且有把握。

神经科学家迈克尔·格拉齐亚诺（Michael Graziano）研究个人空间已有数十年之久。他在 2018 年出版的《我们之间的空间》（The Spaces Between Us）一书的开篇中写道：

我们身边都有一个无形的、保护性的气泡。个人空间、安全边界、口臭区、躲闪与畏缩缓冲区 —— 无论你怎么称呼这个区域，它时刻都环绕在我们身边，就像一个力场一样。这个区域有很多层次，有些层次离我们的皮肤很近，就像紧身衣，还有些层次离得远一些，就像检疫帐蓬。大脑中的复杂网络监控着这些保护性的气泡，通过轻微地（有时是剧烈地）调整我们的行动，来保证这些气泡的安全。你可以走过一间杂乱的房间，轻松地在家具间穿行。在大街上，一只鸽子从你头顶上掠过，你就会赶紧躲开。与朋友比起来，你会站得离老板稍远一些，而你与爱人之间的距离会近得多。个人空间通常隐藏在意识的表面之下，偶尔也会被我们觉察到。它影响着人类体验的每一方面。

格拉齐亚诺指出，个人空间作为「第二层皮肤」的最初概念，是在 20 世纪 60 年代作为一种心理、社会现象发展起来的。爱德华·T. 霍尔（EdwardT.Hall）在 1966 年出版的《隐藏的维度》（The Hidden Dimension）一书中提出了「空间关系」（proxemics）的概念。霍尔用这个概念说明了「人类对空间的利用是一种文化的特殊表现形式」。霍尔的观点建立在动物生物学先驱海尼·黑迪格尔（Heini Hediger）的工作基础之上。黑迪格尔开创了「动物园生物学」—— 研究人类饲养的野生动物的科学。

黑迪格尔曾任苏黎世动物园的园长，他观察发现，在自然环境中的动物，会生活在相对较小的「领地气泡」内，这种「领地气泡」会跟随它们一起移动。他阐述了动物之间的不同互动距离。例如，逃跑距离是指动物在面对另一物种的动物靠近时能够忍受而不逃走的距离。临界距离是指逃跑距离与攻击距离（进入这个范围，被追赶的动物会转身开始进攻）之间的狭窄区域。个人距离与社交距离与同一种动物之间的互动有关。这些互动决定了动物在自身和群体中其他动物之间所保持的正常间距。

霍尔将这些观察的结果应用在了人类身上。虽然逃跑距离和临界距离基本上已经消失了，但个人距离和社交距离依然存在。他提出了四种距离 —— 亲密距离、个人距离、社会距离与公共距离。这些距离不是固定的，会随着情境而变化。它们划定了一个专属区域，一个你不希望他人进入的区域。霍尔是这样说的：「表现出我们称为‘领地意识'的行为，是动物（包括人类）的天性。通过这样的行为，它们能够用这种意识来区分一个个体与另一个个体之间的空间或距离。它们所选择的具体距离取决于互动，取决于互动个体之间的关系，以及它们的感受与行为。」

自 20 世纪 80 年代以来，实验神经科学界对个人空间的兴趣越来越浓厚。事实证明，身体周围的空间会在大脑中有一种特殊的表征。格拉齐亚诺自己的实验最先是在猴子身上做的，近年来才是在人身上做的。他的研究发现了一组极为复杂的特异化「多感官」神经元，这些神经元能让我们记住物体的位置，即使在黑暗中也是如此。他的研究表明，好几种行为（首先研究的是动物及其领地意识，后来对人类进行了社会性观察）原来都有一种神经科学的基础，直到现在才刚刚被人发现。格拉齐亚诺提到过一种「模拟气泡包装袋」，这是一种围绕在身体周围的、无形的第二层皮肤。这种「模拟气泡包装袋」使人重视身体附近的空间，同时也会注意到远处发生的事情。但是，与霍尔最初提出的概念不同，身体周围并不存在一层像巨大包裹一样的单一空间。每个身体部位似乎都有自己的「气泡」。这个系统让我们能通过视觉、听觉、触觉甚至记忆来随时关注物体的位置。该系统依赖于一组明确的大脑区域和一些具有精妙特性的特异化神经元。这个系统能将我们的感官整合在一起，形成一种对于身边物体的视、听、触觉雷达。

我们个人空间的作用机制并不只适用于人 —— 我们同样会将我们的工具纳入自己的近身缓冲区。正是通过这种方式，我们才能在用叉子或螺丝刀时「感觉」到它在做什么，并理解它周围的空间。格拉齐亚诺以吸尘器为例，解释了一个人如何监控吸尘器杆周围的空间，「以确保杆子不会碰到家具或门框、撞倒花瓶、弄伤猫或自己的腿」。他指出，要想熟练地使用工具，你就必须将其周围的空间考虑在内。似乎我们的大脑会将工具整合到身体图式中去，划定一个可调整的安全范围。这个安全范围能够扩张，环绕外界的物体。

这种现象有助于我们理解「准备工作」的重要性 —— 我们需要一个有序而熟悉的环境，让许多事情都能在预期之内。通过这样的安排，我们重新设置了自己的近身缓冲区，这样我们就能把精力集中在手头的工作上，而不必去试着适应我们周围的空间。

### 5.4 个人空间与表现

Personal space and performance

The need to navigate other people's personal space with sensitivity and skill is especially pressing in medicine. Clinicians work with patients, and this involves proximity, contact and physical examination. Experienced doctors negotiate this without even thinking about it. They have become comfortable not only with being close to people physically but with handling any part of a person's body. It's easy to lose sight of how difficult this skill is to acquire, though my experience with the trainee ophthalmologist brought it back. As a medical student, it took me a long time to learn how to move in and out of personal space without showing anxiety or embarrassment or transmitting that to my patients. I had to listen to their chests, palpate their abdomens, move their joints, peer into their eyes and ears. At first I felt acutely uncomfortable. But eventually this clinical touch became a natural part of every medical encounter.

Navigating personal space involves understanding how to respond. As a patient who has already experienced a clinical consultation, you know what to expect. There are conventions you've learned to recognize. It's like going to a classical music concert. There, you find your seat, sit quietly and wait for the performers to come on stage and begin. You don't break open a bottle of whisky, pass round bags of fried chicken, and start telling raucous jokes to the people in the row behind. And the rules are different at a football match or Glastonbury music festival.

These are unspoken patterns of behaviour which we have absorbed since childhood. When you go to the doctor, you know you may need to be examined, so you're not surprised when it happens. Yet entering a patient's personal space as a clinician is the equivalent of going into their house. Indeed, in any sphere of work where you deal with other people, you can't just barge in. You have to be invited. You have to show respect. If everyone takes their shoes off at the door, so should you.

Entering and leaving personal space with grace and respect requires practice. At first you may think that your own imperatives – to acquire information, say, or impress your teachers – take priority over the needs of your patient, colleague or customer. You may not think about their experience much at all, but instead focus upon yourself. Gradually, though, you start to shift from you to them, resetting your focus from yourself to the space between the two of you.

Working in personal space requires sensitivity and an ability to ‘read' people. Skilled professionals are able to enter and ‘inhabit' someone's personal space without causing discomfort or even much awareness. By being at ease in someone's personal space, you help to make them comfortable too. Experts make this look effortless, though everyone knows what an inept or ill-intentioned attempt feels like. It might be a waiter who looms over you, demanding your attention when you're not yet ready to order; or a colleague who stands behind you, reading what's on your computer screen while you type.

Fabrice the hairstylist learned this when he was an apprentice shampooing clients' hair. People are most aware of the personal space in front of them, because that's where they're looking. In the salon, things function differently. In order to work with their hair, Fabrice approaches his clients from the side or behind. They can see him in the mirror, of course, but he isn't directly confronting them. Approaching from the side, where the warning systems of personal space are less sensitive, makes connecting with someone much easier. Good waiters know this too. They don't approach diners directly but from the side, gauging and adjusting their distance as they read the tiny unconscious signals that show where the invisible boundary lies. That's what allows them to move in and out of personal space, reading the dynamics of each individual and group.

Many experts use an unthreatening preliminary manoeuvre to make contact and set the scene. For a hairstylist, that might be running their fingers through their client's hair. Joshua the tailor starts by walking round a customer, then explains that he needs to move closer to gauge the fit of the trousers or jacket. Sam Gallivan, a hand surgeon I work with, takes each patient's hand when they first meet in her clinic. During the usual shake, she holds on for a bit longer as they begin their conversation. After a few moments, she has assessed the range of movement in all the important joints of the patient's fingers and wrist without her patient even realizing it. And she has established a physical contact that sets the tone for the rest of the consultation.

Social and technical skills do not always go hand in hand, and their boundaries are not clear. Fabrice talks about colleagues who are brilliant at cutting and styling hair, yet lack the ease which keeps their clients coming back. Others are highly skilled at social interaction, but their technical and aesthetic powers are ordinary at best. Meanwhile Joshua speaks of cutting tailors whose social skills are outstanding, but whose suits are mediocre. And we've all encountered financial advisers who sound plausible but don't know much, or computer geeks who can fix any problem but won't look you in the eye. To become expert, you need both.

医学工作者尤其需要用敏感的觉察与技巧来对待他人的个人空间。临床医生要与患者一起工作，需要近距离接触患者，包括触碰和身体检查。有经验的医生无须思索就能成功处理这种事情。他们不仅在接近他人身体时游刃有余，而且在触碰人体的任何部位时都非常自然。我们很容易忽视这种技能是多么难以获取，不过我与那位实习眼科医生的经历让我想起了这一点。在上学期间，我花了很长时间来学习如何进出患者的个人空间，而不表现出焦虑、尴尬，或者把这种情绪传递给他们。我必须听他们的胸部、触摸他们的腹部、移动他们的关节、观察他们的眼睛和耳道。起初我觉得很不舒服，但最终，这种临床接触成了每次看病的自然组成部分。

进入个人空间需要明白如何做出应对。作为有就诊经历的患者，你知道会发生什么。有些惯例你已经熟悉了。这就像去听古典音乐会一样。到了音乐会，你要找到自己的座位，安静地坐着，等待表演者上台表演。你不会打开一瓶威士忌，和朋友分食一袋炸鸡翅，然后对后面一排的人讲粗俗的笑话。足球比赛与格拉斯顿伯里音乐节上的规矩是不同的。

这些不言而喻的行为模式是我们从小就学会的。你去看医生时，你知道你可能要做检查，所以在检查的时候你就不会感到惊讶。然而，临床医生进入患者的个人空间就相当于进入患者的房子。事实上，在任何与他人打交道的工作领域，你都不能随意闯入别人的个人空间。你必须得到邀请。你必须表现出尊重。如果每个人在进门前都要脱鞋，那你也应该脱鞋。

优雅和尊重地进入个人空间需要练习。一开始，你可能认为你的要紧事务（比如获取信息，或者给老师留下深刻印象）比患者、同事或顾客的需求更重要。你可能根本不会考虑他们的感受，而把关注点放在自己身上。不过，你会渐渐地把注意力从自己转移到他们身上，把关注点从自己身上移开，转移到你们之间的空间上。在个人空间里工作需要一定的敏感性和「阅读」他人的能力。熟练的专业人士能进入并停留在他人的个人空间，而不会引起不造，甚至不会引起太多注意。在别人的个人空间里感到自在，你也会帮助他人感到舒适。专家让这一点看起来毫不费力，但每个人都知道，如果进入你个人空间的人很笨拙或动机不纯，会给你带来什么感觉。这就好比在你还没有准备点餐的时候，某个服务员朝你逼近，向你唐突地提问；或者是一个同事站在你身后，在你打字时阅读你电脑屏幕上的内容。

发型设计师法布里斯在学徒时期为顾客洗头时学到了这一点。大家最能意识到自己面前的个人空间，因为他们在看向那里。在美发店里，事情却与此不同。为了打理顾客的头发，法布里斯会从侧面或后面接近他们。当然，顾客能从镜子里看见他，但他没有直接面对顾客。人侧面的个人空间警报系统不太敏感，所以从侧面接近更容易与人建立联结。优秀的服务员也知道这一点。他们不会从正面接近食客，而是从侧面接近。他们会一边解读细微的无意识信号 —— 这些信号表明了看不见的边界在哪儿，一边估计和调整自己的距离。这样一来，他们就能进出顾客的个人空间，解读每个个体与群体的关系动力。

许多专家会用一种没有威胁性的初步策略，来接触工作对象，做好工作准备。对于发型设计师来说，这可能是用手指捋一将顾客的头发。裁缝约书亚首先会绕着顾客走一圈，然后解释说他需要靠近一些，来测量裤子或上衣的长度。与我一起工作的手部外科医生萨姆·加利文（Sam Gallivan），每次在诊所里见到患者时都会与他们握手。在通常的握手过程中，她会多握一会儿，并且开始谈话。片刻之后，她就在患者没有意识到人的情况下，评估了患者手指和手腕所有重要关节的活动范围。她还与患者进行了身体接触，为接下来的问诊奠定了基础。

社交技能与专业技能并非总是同步发展的，它们之间的边界也并不明确。法布里斯谈到过一些同事，他们在剪发和发型设计方面才华横溢，但缺乏让顾客再次光临的轻松感。还有些同事擅长人际互动，但他们的专业技能和审美能力却平平无奇。同样地，约书亚也谈到过一些裁缝，他们的社交能力很出色，但设计的西装却很平庸。我们都见过说起话来头头是道却懂得不多的金融顾问，也见过能解决任何问题却不愿看你眼睛的技术人员。要成为专家，这两种能力你都需要。

### 5.5 触摸我的患者

Getting in touch with my patients

Within personal space, much is conveyed through touch. Confidence, assurance and concern, or roughness, indifference and ineptitude; we recognize these in an instant. Yet fluency in the language of touch can't be taken for granted. It has to be attended to, worked at, practised and perfected. In all fields, this is a challenge. As we've seen, touch is proximal and acts in two directions. It's a language you need to learn, but it doesn't have a dictionary.

When I was at medical school, none of my teachers said, ‘Roger, you need to learn how to enter and work within your patients' personal space, and to become fluent in the language of touch.' Nobody said that to Fabrice or Joshua either, and nobody explained it to Jozef when he started working in a team of chefs. We all absorbed these skills without realizing, as a by-product of other work. Those years of doing the bloods, chopping onions, sweeping the floor or measuring inseams helped us to develop the confidence to pass through someone's invisible second skin; to feel comfortable within their personal space and to make them comfortable in return. That took a long time for all of us. But we were aided in our efforts by having a system, a mise en place.

I'm back with Brenda and her newborn baby. It's the middle of the night, and I've almost finished suturing the episiotomy. I've found it stressful, though I've tried not to let that show. I know how important this repair will be for her and I want to do the best I can. I'm also becoming more confident in the two elements we've looked at – taking responsibility for my mise en place and working in someone's personal space. I've been aided on this occasion by experienced colleagues, essential members of the system I'm in. There was the midwife who showed me how to set out my trolley, and the nurse who talked to Brenda while I concentrated on my task.

I tie and cut the final suture, gather up my swabs and instruments, put the needles into a sharps bin, remove the green drapes and peel off my gloves. The midwife's scissor cut was expertly made and I've managed to close the perineal layers in the way I've been taught. Brenda's wound will heal up well. I help her out of the stirrups and make sure she's comfortable. Then I reassure her that it's all over and that everything's fine. ‘Thank you, Doctor,' Brenda says. ‘I hardly felt a thing. But now I'm so tired I'm going to have a sleep.'

I say goodbye and leave her to share her personal space with her new baby, then go back to bed and get some sleep before my pager goes off again. On this occasion, everything went smoothly. But things don't always go according to plan. In the next chapter, we'll look at those scary times when things go wrong.

在个人空间里，许多信息都是通过触摸传递的。信心、可靠与关心，或者粗暴、冷漠与无能。我们在片刻间就能感觉出来。然而，娴熟的触觉语言并不是轻易得来的。这种能力需要你留心、努力练习与完善。在所有领域，这都是一种挑战。正如我们所见，触摸是一种近距离的接触，具有双向作用。这是一门需要学习的语言，但没有关于它的字典。

在我上医学院的时候，没有老师说过：「罗杰，你得学会如何进入患者的个人空间，在那里面工作，还要熟练运用触摸的语言。」没有人对法布里斯和约书亚这么说，也没有人在约瑟夫开始在厨师团队里工作时向他解释过这一点。这些技能是其他工作的副产品，我们都在不知不觉间学会了这些东西。那些年的采血、切洋葱、扫地或量内缝的工作，帮助我们培养出穿过别人看不见的第二层皮肤的信心，也帮助我们培养出能在他人的个人空间里感到自如，同时也让他们感到舒服的信心。我们都花了很长时间才能做到这一点。但是，我们的努力都得到了一个系统、一种「准备工作」的帮助。

回到布伦达和她的新生儿身边。当时已经是深夜，会阴切开术的缝合已接近尾声。我的压力很大，不过我尽量不表现出来。我知道这次修复手术对她来说有多重要，我想尽力做到最好。我对这两个方面也更加自信了：为自己的「准备工作」负责，在别人的个人空间里工作。这一次，我得到了经验丰富的同事的帮助，他们是我所在的系统里的重要成员。助产士教会了我如何布置好手推车里的器械，护士在我专心工作时和布伦达讲话。

我打上结，剪断最后一根缝合线，收拾好我的棉签和器械，把针头放进利器箱里，取下绿色的手术巾，摘下手套。助产士的剪刀切口干净利落，我也成功地按照老师教的方法缝合了会阴层。布伦达的伤口会愈合得很好。我帮她把腿从腿架上放下来，确保她舒服地躺着。然后我向她保证一切都结束了，一切都很顺利。「谢谢你，医生，」布伦达说，「我几乎一点儿感觉都没有。可我现在太累了，我要睡一觉。」

我道了别，让她和刚出生的宝宝共享私人空间，然后回到了自己的床上，打算在呼机再次响起之前睡上一会儿。这一次，一切都很顺利，但事情并非总会按计划发展。在下一章里，我们会看到那些事情出错的可怕情况。
