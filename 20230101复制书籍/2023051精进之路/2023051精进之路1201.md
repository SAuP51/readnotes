## 1201. 专家的重要性

1201 Why experts matter

When I noticed damp in my house, I called Richard, an expert recommended by a friend. Richard listened as I described the problem, then walked around my basement and peered at the walls and the floor. He got out a meter and took some readings. After collecting his thoughts, he outlined what he saw as the issue, suggested some possible approaches, and recommended the option he thought best. Rather to my surprise, it turned out to be one of the less expensive ones.

I asked Richard how he'd decided what to advise. He explained that he'd been in the business for almost forty years, and had worked in a lot of houses like mine. He'd seen similar problems many times and tried all kinds of solutions. Although some new materials and technologies had recently become available, he felt that a conservative approach would work best in my case. He believed that what he suggested would fix the problem, though he didn't know for certain. If it didn't, there were other avenues we could explore. We agreed to go ahead on that basis.

At that point, I had no direct evidence of Richard's technical skills, though my friend had said they were excellent. My relationship was with Richard as a person – as an expert in his field. Richard had started by identifying my problem. He wasn't thinking only of meter readings, and he wasn't out for a short-term profit. Instead, he used his experience to suggest a way forward that made sense to us both. I trusted him and what he said, because I believed he was an expert. Richard did what I do as a clinician, what Joshua does as a tailor, and what the other experts in this book are so good at.

我发现我的房子受潮了，于是打电话给理查德，他是一个朋友推荐给我的专家。理查德听我讲完我的问题，然后在地下室里走来走去，检查墙壁和地板。他掏出一个仪表，测量了一下读数。整理好思路后，他概述了他认为的问题，提出了一些可能的解决方法，并推荐了他认为最好的选择。让我颇为惊讶的是，这种选择竟然是比较便宜的一种。

我问理查德，他是如何决定该提什么建议的。他解释说，他在这一行干了将近 40 年，维修过许多像我家这样的房子。类似的问题他见过许多次，尝试过各种各样的解决办法。虽然近来出现了一些新的材料和技术，但他觉得保守的方法对我的问题来说是最好的。虽然不能确定，但他相信自己的建议能解决问题。如果问题没有解决，我们还可以探索其他途径。我们决定就这么办。

尽管我朋友说理查德非常优秀，但当时我没有直接的证据证明他的技术水平。我和理查德的关系是人与人的关系 —— 他是他领域里的一个专家。理查德先是发现了我的问题。接下来他并没有只考虑仪表读数，也没有追求短期利益。相反，他运用了自己的经验，提出了一种我们俩都赞同的方法。我相信他和他说的话。理查德做的事，就是我作为医生、约书亚作为裁缝所做的事，以及本书其他专家所擅长的事。

### 12.1 专家说的话

What the experts say

We all need experts like Richard because we rely on what they do; when we have problems, we need experts to fix them. When we are ill, we need doctors. When we fly, we need pilots. When we have a problem in our basement, we need specialists in treating damp. Yet the talk today about experts often leaves me angry. In this final chapter, I'll explain why.

I often hear experts dismissed as irrelevant – no longer of value in a rapidly changing world. I hear them written off as a useless elite. Yet nothing could be further from the truth, as we all realize when we are sick, or on an aeroplane, or find damp in our house.

But the services which experts provide are only part of their importance. Becoming expert is at the core of being human. It doesn't matter if we end up as an expert, recognized by our peers and the wider world – what matters is that we become better at whatever we strive to achieve. Whatever our interests, devoting years to something worthwhile meets a deep need: to immerse ourselves in something bigger than we are.

In this book, I've tracked the internal processes of becoming expert. These processes are less often written about than the declarative knowledge or component skills of ‘expertise'. Partly that's because knowledge and skill are easier to demonstrate and test. But it's also because, as an insider, it's easy to lose sight of the stages you went through as you became expert. Soon that experience of becoming disappears from view, however tough you found it at the time. But it's that very experience that's so important and so worthwhile. Becoming expert is about channelling our energies into something that has purpose and meaning. It's about making use of the potential we all have, to achieve something that goes beyond humdrum everyday life.

Becoming an expert of this kind involves a shift in who you are, not just in how much you know and what you can do. In this book, I distinguish between the knowing that focuses on process – the skills and procedural knowledge of a plumber, a tailor or a surgeon – and the transformations that go on underneath. Becoming expert is about your relationship with your work and the people you do it for and with. It allows you to work with thin materials on the verge of collapse, to judge when to act and when to hold back, to let someone else go ahead and make mistakes because you know they have to learn.

I believe that we all have the capacity to become expert, whether we recognize it or not. Of course, not everyone can become an international concert pianist, a surgical pioneer, a famous sculptor or a Nobel Prize–winning scientist. Most people wouldn't want to – becoming a Nobel Prize–winning scientist is to live your whole life for science. But we're all on a path, we all do things we care about, and we can all get better at doing them. The ideas in this book will resonate with anyone who joins a basketball club, gives presentations to colleagues at work, learns a foreign language, goes to a pottery class or designs spreadsheets. Becoming expert is about recognizing our potential and letting it grow. Like a deep ocean current, becoming expert may not be visible on the surface, but its effects are profound.

While it's clear that we need experts, we often think of them as a species apart. We overlook the fact that we can all become expert ourselves, or at least move in that direction. Though the taxidermists, tailors and magicians in this book might seem exotic, we can all aspire to do what they do, though to a different extent and in our own area of interest. But we often fail to see the parallels between what such experts have gone through and what we are experiencing ourselves. We don't recognize them as examples of what we can become.

All the experts in this book have something in common: what they do is central to who they are. This doesn't mean that becoming expert is restricted to your main occupation. Your passion may be dismissively described by others as a ‘hobby'. But many people are more expert at their hobby than their ‘proper' job.

Becoming expert does not depend on how society gauges the value of your work, for society is fickle and inconstant. And it's not about fame or money either. Instead, it's about the path you take. If you are going through the stages in this book, as I believe we all are, you are on your way to becoming expert, whether you're a plumber, a pilot or a Sunday painter.

I've tried to give a realistic sense of what this path is like. It's not a steady climb upwards; it's more like a difficult mountain pass. You might have to descend to get around some obstacle before you can continue. You'll go through bleak times when you feel you're standing still or going backwards. It takes belief and perseverance to stick with it, to realize that the path is going upwards overall. Becoming expert takes time – lots of time.

I hope this book has helped to counter the argument that you can do everything in a rush. I am aware that there are courses on the internet that claim to teach you to speak a language, play a musical instrument or become an investment banker in just one month. But these short, snipped-up experiences aren't satisfying alternatives to a long-term commitment. You can't master the guitar in a month, because there isn't an end point to mastering the guitar. You can start, but you never finish. That's the fascination of becoming expert.

Even in a fast-moving society like ours, some things remain constant. We need experts to move us around the world, treat us when we're sick, fix things when they go wrong, create beauty and inspire us. The specifics do change, of course. Things that were taken for granted become obsolete. For the most part we no longer develop photographs in darkrooms, use manual typewriters or send telegrams, so we no longer need experts in those areas. Now we have different approaches to creating images, communicating at distance and writing text. Soon, these too will change. Yet the developments of the future will require experts as much as the past ever did – more so, as the complexity of our world increases. Robotics, artificial intelligence, new forms of energy, the responsible stewardship of resources – all these will depend on experts. And those experts of the future must apply themselves to their craft with the same sense of purpose as Derek the taxidermist, Andrew the wood engraver and Joshua the tailor do today. Although their fields may be very different, the process will remain the same.

我们都需要理查德这样的专家，因为我们依赖他们的工作。当我们遇到问题的时候，我们需要专家来解决问题。我们生病时，需要医生。我们乘飞机时，需要飞行员。我们的地下室有问题，就需要专家来处理潮湿的问题。然而，现在有关专家的论调常常让我生气。在最后一章里，我会解释为什么。

我经常听说有人认为专家无关紧要 —— 他们在瞬息万变的世界里不再有价值了。我听说专家被认为是无用的精英。然而事实远非如此。在生病时、乘飞机时、屋子受潮时，我们都会意识到这一点。

然而专家提供的服务只是他们重要性的一部分。成为专家是做人的核心。我们最终是否成为专家，是否能得到同行和更广阔的世界的认可，这并不重要 —— 重要的是，无论我们努力实现什么目标，我们都要精益求精。不管我们的兴趣是什么，花上多年时间去做一些有价值的事情，能够满足我们的一种深层需求：让自己沉浸在比自身更伟大的事情里。

在本书中，我记录了成为专家的内在过程。比起「专长」的陈述性知识或者子技能，很少有人写到这些内在过程。这在一定程度上是因为知识和技能更容易被展示和测试。然而，这也是因为，专业人士很容易忘记自己在成为专家的过程中经历的阶段。不管当时有多艰难，那种「成为」专家的过程很快就会消失在视野中。但是这种经历却无比重要，弥足珍贵。成为专家就是要把我们的精力输送到有目的、有意义的事情上；就是要发挥我们所有人都有的潜能，做出一些超越平凡人的日常生活的事情。

成为这样的专家，需要你改变自己，这种改变不仅在于你有多少知识，能做什么事情。在本书中，我区分了专注于过程的知识（管道工、裁缝或外科医生的技能和程序性知识）与内在的转变。成为专家涉及你与自己的工作、你工作的受众及所接触的人之间的关系。成为专家让你能够处理濒临崩溃的脆弱工作对象，判断什么时候应该行动；什么时候应该克制自己，允许别人放手做事、犯错，因为你知道他们必须吸取教训。

我相信我们都有能力成为专家，不管我们承认与否。当然，不是每个人都会成为在全球演出的钢琴家、外科的先驱者、著名雕塑家或者获得诺贝尔奖的科学家。大多数不想成为这样的人 —— 做一个诺贝尔奖得主，就要把一生奉献给科学。但是我们都走在同一条路上，都在做我们关心的事情，而且我们都可以做得更好。对于任何加入篮球俱乐部、给同事做报告、学习外语、参加陶艺班或制作电子表格的人来说，他们都能与本书中的观念产生共鸣。成为专家就是要认识到自己的潜能，并让它成长壮大。就像深海洋流一样，成为专家可能不会表现在外表上，但这个过程的影响是深远的。

虽然很明显我们需要专家，但我们经常认为他们与我们完全不同。我们忽略了这样一个事实：我们每个人都可以成为专家，或至少朝这个方向前进。虽然书中的标本剥制师、裁缝和魔术师看起来有些不同寻常，但我们都可以在自己感兴趣的领域，力求做到他们所做到的事情 —— 尽管我们达到的造诣深浅不同。然而我们往往看不到这些专家的经历与我们自身的体验有何相似之处。我们不认为他们是我们可以成为的榜样。

本书中的所有专家都有一个共同点：他们所做的事情对于他们的身份来说至关重要。这不意味着你只能在自己的主要工作领域里成为专家。你所热爱的东西可能会被别人不屑地称为一种「爱好」，但许多人在爱好上比在工作上更专业。

成为专家并不取决于社会如何衡量你工作的价值，因为社会是变幻无常的。这也不是名誉或金钱的问题。相反，重要的是你选择的道路。如果你正在经历本书中写的这些阶段（我相信我们都是如此），那么你就在成为专家，无论你是管道工、飞行员还是业余画家。

我已经尝试让大家对这条道路产生一种真实的感觉。这不是一个稳步上升的过程，更像是一条艰难的山路。你可能要向下走一段路，绕开一些障碍，然后才能继续向上。当你觉得自己停滞不前或倒退的时候，你会经历惨淡的时期。坚持下去需要信念与毅力，你要意识到这条路的大方向是向上的。成为专家需要时间 —— 许多时间。

我希望这本书有助于反驳这种观点：所有事都可以一蹴而就。我知道，网上有些课程声称能在一个月内教会你说一门语言、弹奏一种乐器或成为一名投资银行家，但这些短暂、浅尝辄止的经历不能代替长期的投入。你不可能在一个月内掌握吉他，因为掌握没有终点。你可以开始，但你永远不会走到终点。

这就是成为专家的魅力所在。

即使在我们这样一个快速变化的社会里，有些东西仍然是不变的。我们需要专家带我们去世界各地，在我们生病时治疗我们，在我们出错时解决问题，创造美好的事物并激励我们。

当然，具体的事物会发生变化。我们认为理所应当的事物会过时。在今天的大部分情况下，我们不再在暗房里冲洗照片，不再用手动打字机，不再发电报，所以我们不再需要这些领域的专家了。现在我们有不同的方式生成图像、远距离交流、书写文本。很快，这些也会改变。然而，未来的发展会像过去一样需要专家 —— 随着世界越来越错综复杂，情况更是如此。机器人、人工智能、新能源、资源的负责任管理 —— 所有这些都将依赖于专家。这些专家必须像今天的标本剥制师德里克、木版雕刻师安德鲁和裁缝约书亚一样，怀着同样的使命感专注于自己的技艺。尽管他们的领域可能大不相同，但这个过程会保持不变。

### 12.2 毒素与养分

Toxins and nutrients

The opportunity to become expert should be one of our inalienable rights. It's how we fulfil our potential as human beings. Yet the slow process required is at odds with demands for instant gratification. There's a growing sense that anyone can learn to do anything – and quickly. But that's not the case. Becoming expert involves sticking at something for much longer than you normally would. Of course, just persevering doesn't automatically turn you into an expert, and there are plenty of people who keep doing the same thing and don't get much better – like me with my juggling.

Like any organic process, becoming expert needs nutrients. These include guidance and encouragement, exposure to mistakes, opportunities for spending time with your materials and the people you work with, and allowing your personality to unfold. I've described this path as if you started when you become an Apprentice. I've told the stories of people in specialized fields where it can seem that their careers only began when they joined their workshop, studio or salon. But there is always a background. Throughout our childhood we are immersed in a world of the senses, experiencing the world and the people around us. At home and at school, we stock our internal library of sensations, knowledge and skills which we build on later. We need to experience what it is to look, hear, touch, sniff and taste; to work with other people; to share space and to negotiate our wishes around theirs. Becoming expert is part of a story which begins when we are born.

Yet in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, conditions for becoming expert are under threat. These threats include a relentless pressure to speed everything up, a narrowing of school curriculums, and a neoliberal mindset that sees everything in terms of the bottom line and places short-term profit over long-term value. More pressure comes from reduced social contact and dwindling opportunities for engaging physically with the material world. Paradoxically, as we are becoming more connected globally, local isolation is getting worse. Opportunities for shared doing are becoming scarcer.

Concentration and focus are being nibbled away at by the demands of email and social media. The urgent takes precedence over the important, and pressures for an immediate response can be overwhelming. Gradual processes are under attack, whether in food, reading or craftsmanship. Slow learning is being squeezed by political pressure to achieve qualifications faster, with less effort and fewer resources. Qualifications themselves are skewed by an obsession with assessment. But quantifying what students learn at the expense of how they learn it is dangerously short-sighted.

Young people are being deprived of the opportunities they need to make the most of their potential. When newcomers start in an expert field, we expect them to have basic skills of reading, writing, arithmetic and using a computer, to have an understanding of the world around them. We expect a basic fluency in the physical world, an understanding that is built through years of exposure at home and at school. We expect people to relate to others they work alongside, to behave responsibly and to look out for one another's safety. If we can no longer take that fluency for granted, we must do something to redress it, or make allowances for the time it will take to build up later. We know the conditions that becoming expert requires, yet we are allowing them to be destroyed.

I've noticed this at the university where I work. Until recently, you could assume that first-year students would arrive with a range of basic skills they'd learned at home and school through working with their hands. Cutting with scissors and paper, sticking things together with glue, writing with a pen, tying knots in shoelaces and string – all skills which should develop throughout childhood. Some people are more dextrous or confident than others, of course, but there was a baseline you could rely on, a shared experience of having done stuff. Young people had also learned to do things in front of others, through music, drama and dance. Even if they weren't good performers in a conventional sense, they had gained vital experience.

In recent years, my colleagues and I have found that we can no longer make these assumptions. Young people entering science and medicine at our university have excellent academic results, but many struggle to tie a firm knot, cut out a shape with scissors, or speak in front of other people. Though a glance at the UK state secondary school curriculum gives a clue as to why this is, my students come from all over the world, which makes me think the problem is global.

Art, design, music, dance, cooking and other subjects that involve dexterity and performance are being eradicated from the curriculum. Even science subjects are taught in an abstracted way, with few opportunities to work in a laboratory and carry out experiments for yourself. Pupils in science lessons have their chemicals measured out for them in advance, to save teachers' time and make sure that the practicals ‘work'. Opportunities for error are being eliminated by an institutional aversion to risk. Young people no longer experience what it feels like to get things wrong and have to put them right.

There is also a pernicious tendency to divide and categorize our lives. ‘Doing' is relegated to the art room, yet art rooms are being abolished. Performance is confined to music or drama, yet music and drama are being cut out. This is a tragedy and a disgrace. We are stripping people of their birthright – their confidence to work with the material world around them. Talking to a head teacher at a north London school, I was horrified to learn that some pupils are unable to hold a pen or use a pair of scissors because they have never had the opportunity to try. This is not for lack of will on the part of the school. Quite the opposite. It comes from a combination of decades of inadequate resourcing and a lack of insight into how people become expert. This is not just a problem for young people coming into the system now. It's a problem for us all.

The push for quick results is having an especially baneful effect. A preoccupation with visual, screen-based information is making the problem more evident. Young people learn about chemistry experiments by watching scientists online, not by doing the work themselves. The sounds and smells of science are being sanitized. People are becoming spectators, not participants. Sensory richness is being flattened by technologies which privilege sight over the other senses.

As you'll have seen so far, I'm all in favour of technology. I'm writing this book on a laptop computer. I have worked throughout my career with people who operate at the cutting edge of technological innovation, and I am excited that each new generation will be expert in things that I can't yet conceive of. My point is that we should use technological advances and social change to enrich our experiences, not impoverish them.

We are in a perilous place at the moment. We risk losing skills without even noticing that they're disappearing, like habitat loss elsewhere in the world. The statistics are alarming. In the United Kingdom, school exam entries in creative subjects have fallen by over 20 per cent since 2010, and entries in design and technology have fallen by 57 per cent. The skills of doing are being wrenched out of curriculums. There is an insidious assumption that science is more productive than the arts, and that there is no place for art within science. This is short-sighted to the point of madness.

Myopic initiatives to ‘streamline' systems which have evolved over many years are hollowing out the expertise of communities. That mixture of ‘newcomers and old-timers', as Lave and Wenger put it, is disappearing. Becoming expert is seen as individual, not collective. Yet all the stories in this book show how much we depend on one another, on communities of practice, as we move along our own path to becoming expert.

This is not a nostalgic yearning for an imaginary golden age. There are plenty of bad things about the old-fashioned apprenticeship system. It encouraged bullying and exploitation. It expected inhuman levels of work. It put a system ahead of those within it. Often, it stultified initiative and prevented people from realizing their potential, keeping them in dead-end roles long after they should have progressed, or not allowing them to participate at all.

It's not all doom and gloom, however. Domains of practice may come and go, but reports of the death of experts have been much exaggerated. Becoming expert remains a basic human need, and the opportunity to pursue that path should be there for every one of us. The threats are real, but they can be countered. The people in this book are living proof of that. They exemplify the principles I've outlined: paying close attention for a long time to something worthwhile that requires and repays sustained commitment; subordinating your desires to the needs of other people; and becoming as good as you can be, even if your area of interest falls outside the mainstream.

As I said earlier, the ecosystem of expertise depends on nutrients which we have a responsibility to deliver. These nutrients include a supportive environment, having basic material needs provided for, and becoming part of a group of like-minded people. A nutrient-rich environment should provide opportunities to gain physical skill, factual knowledge and a sensitivity to materials and people.

Perhaps the biggest threat of all is impatience. We are losing sight of the need for slow learning. Learners need time and support. Experts only emerge through a long process of growth and maturation, like trees growing in a forest. Like trees, experts need to develop without being uprooted and transplanted. Uprooting and transplanting wastes energy on new rooting that would be far better spent on growing upwards.

When it happens as it should, travelling the path to becoming expert is like a personal relationship. It has the potential to sustain and enrich. It offers great satisfaction and invites lifelong contribution in return. Like other long-term relationships, it doesn't have a clear-cut end. Large enough and flexible enough to contain your growth and evolution, it grows and evolves with you.

成为专家的机会应当是我们不可剥夺的权利之一。这样我们才能发挥我们生而为人的潜能。然而，这种缓慢的过程与即时满足的需求是格格不入的。越来越多的人认为，任何人可以学做任何事 —— 而且很快就能学会，但事实并非如此。要成为专家，就需要在一件事上投入远比平常更多的时间。当然，仅靠坚持不懈不会自动让你成为专家，很多人一直在做同样的事情，但并没有进步 —— 就像我学杂耍一样。

就像任何有机的过程一样，成为专家需要养分。这包括指导和鼓励，犯错，花时间与你的工作对象、工作时接触的人在一起，允许自己的个性逐渐展现出来。我已经讲述过你成为学徒、走上这条路时的情形。我也讲过一些专业领域里的人的故事，他们的职业生涯似乎是在进入他们的工坊、工作室或美发店后才开始的。但是大背景无处不在。整个童年，我们一直沉浸在感官的世界里，体验着世界和周围的人。无论是在家还是在学校，我们都在内在的信息库里积累大量感觉、知识和技能，我们日后会在这个基础上不断发展进步。我们需要体验视觉、听觉、触觉、嗅觉和味觉；需要和其他人一起工作；需要与他人共处一个空间，在自我和他人的意愿之间找到平衡。成为专家是我们人生故事的一部分，这个故事从我们出生时就开始了。

然而，在世界上的许多地方，包括英国在内，成为专家的条件受到了威胁。这些威胁包括使一切加速的无情压力、学校课程的缩减，以及从成本、收益的角度看待一切、将短期利益置于长远价值之上的新自由主义思维。更多的压力来自社会接触的减少，亲身接触物质世界的机会的减少。矛盾的是，随着我们在全球范围内的联系越来越紧密，地区的孤立却越发严重。共同工作的机会越来越少了。

注意力和专注力正在被电子邮件和社交媒体蚕食。紧急的事情优先于重要的事情，立即做出反应的压力可能会让人不堪重负。无论是在美食、阅读还是手工艺方面，循序渐进的过程都受到了冲击。缓慢的学习过程受到了环境压力的打压 —— 这种压力要求学生用更少的努力和资源，更快地获取资质。对于评估的痴迷已经扭曲了资质本身。但是，以牺牲学习质量的代价来量化学生的学习内容，是一种危险的短视。

年轻人失去了充分发挥自身潜能所需要的机会。新人进入一个专业领域的时候，我们希望他们具备阅读、写作、算术和使用电脑的基本技能，了解周围的世界。我们希望他们对物质世界有基本的了解，这种了解是通过多年在家、在学校的经历建立起来的。我们希望他们能与工作中的他人建立良好的关系，为自己的行为负责，照看彼此的安全。如果我们不再把具备这些基本能力看作理所应当，我们就必须做些事情来纠正这一点，或者为这些能力的培养预留出一些时间。我们知道成为专家所需要的条件，但我们却放任这些条件受到破坏。

我在大学工作时就发现了这一点。直到最近，你可能还以为，一年级学生在入学时，应当掌握一系列他们在家和在学校里通过动手学习到的基本技能。用剪刀剪纸、用胶水粘东西、用笔写字、系鞋带、给绳子打结 —— 所有这些技能都应该是在童年期培养的。当然，有些人比其他人更手巧、更自信，但学生群体本应该有一个基础的水平，一种做过这些事情的共同经历。年轻人还应该通过音乐、戏剧和舞蹈学会在别人面前做事。

即使他们不是传统意义上的优秀表演者，但他们也会因此获得重要的经验。

近年来，同事和我发现，我们不能再如此想当然了。在我们的大学里，进入理学和医学领域的年轻人成绩优异，但许多人连打绳结、用剪刀剪裁图形、在他人面前讲话都会遇到困难。虽然看一眼英国公立中学的课程就知道这是为什么，但我的学生来自世界各地，所以我认为这是一个全球性的问题。

艺术、设计、音乐、舞蹈、烹饪，以及其他涉及技巧与表演的学科都从课程表里消失了。甚至连科学的学科也在以抽象的方式讲授，学生很少有机会在实验室里学习，凭自己的兴趣做实验。在科学课程上，为了节省老师的时间，确保实际操作「正确无误」，学生要用的化学物质都已经为他们称好了。由于我们的制度厌恶风险，犯错的机会正在消失。年轻人不会再体验到犯错、必须纠正错误的感觉。

我们还有一种将生活分门别类的有害倾向。「动手」被归为艺术教室里的事情，而艺术教室正在被废除。表演则仅限于音乐或戏剧，而音乐和戏剧课则正在被削减。这是一场悲剧和耻辱。我们正在剥夺学生与生俱来的权利 —— 他们与周围的物质世界打交道的信心。在与伦敦北部一所学校的校长交流时，我大吃一惊：有些学生不会握笔，或者不会使用剪刀，因为他们从没有尝试的机会。这不是因为学校缺乏意愿。恰恰相反。这是由于他们几十年来的资源不足，以及不了解人是如何成为专家的。这不仅仅是年轻人进入社会面临的问题。这是我们所有人的问题。

这种快速追求成果的做法，产生了极为有害的影响。视觉的、电子设备屏幕上的信息占据了人的大部分注意力，因此这个问题变得更加明显。年轻人通过在线观看科学家的实验来学习化学实验，而不是自己动手做实验。科学的声音和气味正在消失。大家成了旁观者，而不是参与者。丰富的感觉信息被重视视觉、忽视其他感觉的技术所消除了。

如你所见，我完全支持技术进步。我正在笔记本电脑上写作本书。在我的职业生涯里，我一直在与那些在技术创新前沿工作的人合作，每一代年轻人都将在我无法想象的事情上成为专家，这让我感到很兴奋。我想说的是，我们应该利用技术进步和社会变革来丰富我们的体验，而不是让体验变得贫乏。

我们正处于一个危险的境地。我们可能会失去许多技能，却没有意识到它们正在消失，就像世界其他地方的生物栖息地逐渐消失一样。相关的统计数据让人担忧。在英国，自 2010 年起，创意类学科的入学考试参加人数下降了 20％以上，设计类和技术类专业的入学人数下降了 57％。动手技能的教学正在从课程设置中消失。有一种隐秘而危险的假设认为，科学比艺术更有价值，科学中没有艺术的一席之地。这种目光已经短浅到了疯狂的程度。

这种「精简」的弊政经过多年的发展，已经掏空了实践社群的专业精神。如莱夫和温格所说的「新人与老手的交流」正在迅速消失。成为专家被看作是个人的事情，而不需要集体的力量。然而，本书中的所有故事都表明，在我们成为专家的路上，我们多么依赖彼此，依赖实践社群。

这不是一种对假想的黄金时代的怀旧渴望。传统的学徒制有很多不好的地方。那种制度鼓励霸凌与剥削，要求不人道的工作量；它将一套规则摆在处于这种制度下的人的面前。这种学徒制往往会抑制人的主动性，妨碍他们发挥自己的潜能，让他们在本应取得进步的很长一段时间后，依然困在毫无意义的工作里，或者根本不允许他们参与到工作中来。

然而，现实情况可能不全是糟糕的。不同的实践领域可能出现又消失，但「专家已死」的说法实在有些夸张。成为专家依然是人类的基本需求，在这条道路上探索的机会应该为我们每个人所有。这些威胁都是真实存在的，但它们是可以被应对的。本书中的这些人就是活生生的例子。他们践行了我概述的原则：长期专注于有价值的事情 —— 这些事情需要持续的投入，而这种投入能带来奖赏；让自己的欲求从属于他人的需要；即使自己的领域不在主流之内，也要精益求精。

我之前说过，专长的生态系统依赖于我们有责任提供的养分。这些养分包括提供支持性的环境，满足基本的物质需求，成为志同道合的群体中的一员。一个给养丰富的环境应该提供机会，让人获得身体技能、事实性知识，以及对待工作对象和他人的敏感性。

也许最大的威胁就是缺乏耐心。我们正在忽视缓慢学习的必要性。学习者需要时间和支持。专家必须经过漫长的成长和成熟过程，就像树木在森林中成长一样。就像树木一样，专家需要发展，而不是被连根拔起、移植。拔起和移植浪费了重新生根的能量，而这些能量本可以更好地用于向上生长。

当成为专家的过程恰如其分地发生时，它就像一种人与人的关系。它具有经久不衰和丰富充盈的潜力。它能为人提供极大的满足感，让人为之奉献终生。就像其他的长期关系一样，这个过程没有明确的终点。这个过程足够宏大、足够灵活，能容纳你的成长和进化，它也会随着你一起成长和进化。

### 12.3 终点？

The end?

So what is being expert? How do you know when you've become one? The truth is, you never really get there. The path to becoming expert doesn't have an end. So I'll finish with some thoughts about writing this book, using it as a mirror for the ideas it contains.

This is the first book I've written on my own, so I'm not an expert author. Yet it's not the first time I've written anything, so it's a point along my path to becoming expert. That process started at primary school, when I learned the letters of the alphabet and put them together to make simple words. Over the years I've done a lot of writing, from student exams and GP referral letters to essays and scientific papers. But it wasn't until I started writing this book that these stages I've gone through became coherent.

As I was doing time with all that writing, I was using my senses, responding to what other people had written, and sharpening my ideas about what worked and what didn't. I developed a feel for the kind of writer I wanted to become. I got a sense of thin materials on the verge of collapse, of how much I could squeeze a sentence before it lost its meaning or how far I could stretch it before it snapped. I tried things out, got them wrong and had to put them right.

At first my focus was on myself and how I wanted to say things. But then I had to make the transition ‘from you to them'. I had to shift from what I wanted to write to what other people would find interesting to read. I had to think how my work would land. I began to develop my voice, my style, my individuality. Now I'm working on how to combine all that to express ideas I've been struggling to articulate for decades, and how to move my field in a different direction.

For each step forward there have been two steps back. I've had to improvise, to respond to the contexts I work in and the people I meet. I've kept reframing my ideas and thinking of new ways to express them. But now I have to stop. I know this book will never be as good as it could be. But sooner or later you need to perform what you've been practising, share it with other people and move on. Echoing Paul Valéry the poet, my editor put it like this: you never finish a book; you just decide when to abandon it.

For me, that sense of never quite being finished lies at the heart of becoming expert. It's an unending process with an elusive goal, but it meets a need in all of us. It's what Andrew Davidson in Chapter 4 meant when he said, ‘For more than forty years I've been trying to make the perfect print from a woodblock. I never have, and I know I never will. But I'll never stop trying.' It's what Joshua Byrne meant when he said that he knows there's no such thing as a perfect suit, but he'll always keep trying to make one. It's what I feel about being a doctor, too. There's no perfect operation and no perfect consultation. But we should never stop trying. It's what the path to becoming expert is all about.

成为专家意味着什么？你怎么知道自己什么时候成了专家？事实上，你永远不会真的达成这个目标。成为专家的道路没有终点。因此，我将以一些写作本书时想到的东西作为结尾，将这些想法当作一面镜子，反映本书中所包含的思想。

这是我独立写作的第一本书，所以我不是一个专家级的作者。但这不是我第一次写东西，所以这是我在成为专家之路上的一站。这一过程始于小学，那时我学会了字母表，并把字母组合起来，构成简单的单词。多年以来，我写了许多东西，从学生时代的考试到全科医生的转诊信，再到文章和科研论文。

但是，直到我开始写作本书的时候，我经历的所有这些阶段才变成了一个连贯的整体。

在我为写作积累经验的时候，我运用了自己的感官，品鉴了其他人所写的东西，对哪些文字好、哪些不好有了清晰的想法。对于自己想成为哪种作者，我产生了一种感觉。我曾感受过脆弱的工作对象处于崩溃边缘的感觉，我了解了我能在一个句子失去意义之前将其缩减到什么程度，以及它在变味儿之前能延长到什么长度。我尝试过，犯过错，也曾不得不改正。

一开始，我关注的只有我自己和我想说的话，但我后来不得不做出「从你到他们」的转变。我必须从写自己想写的东西，转变到写他人愿意读的东西。我必须考虑别人对我的作品有何感受。我逐渐找到了自己的「声音」、风格、个性。现在，我在努力把所有这些结合起来，表达我几十年来一直想表达的想法，思考如何带领我的领域走向一个不同的方向。

我每前进一步，就会倒退两步。我必须随机应变，对我工作的环境和遇见的人做出反应。我不断地整理自己的想法，思考新的表达方式。但现在我必须停下来。我知道这本书永远达不到理想的水平。你迟早都要把你一直在练习的东西拿出来表演，与他人分享，然后继续前进。我的编辑说了一句话，与诗人保罗·瓦莱里（Paul Valéry）的话有异曲同工之妙：你永远写不完一本书，你只需要决定在什么时候放下它。

对我来说，那种永远无法完成的感觉就是成为专家的核心。这是一个永无止境的过程，其目标是难以捉摸的，但它满足了我们所有人都有的一种需求。安德鲁·戴维森在第 4 章所说的那句话就表达了这个意思：「40 多年来，我一直在尝试用木板制作出完美的版画。我从来没做到过，我知道我永远也做不到，但我决不会停止努力。」约书亚·伯恩说他知道没有完美的西装，但他会一直努力去做。他表达的也是这个意思。这也是我做医生的感觉。没有完美的手术，也没有完美的问诊，但是我们不应停止尝试。这就是成为专家之路的重中之重。
