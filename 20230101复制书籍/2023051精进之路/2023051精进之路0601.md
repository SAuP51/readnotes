## 0601. 犯错与改正

0601 Getting it wrong and putting it right

One night at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, I start operating on Jonas, a young man who has been stabbed in the neck. I haven't been at Bara very long. To say I'm anxious would be an understatement. Neck wounds are notorious. A combination of spasm in an artery's wall and a temporary blood clot often stop the initial bleeding, and at first the damage doesn't seem too serious. This comforting sense of security disappears abruptly when you dislodge the clot and a pulsating fountain of blood hits you in the face. Before you know where you are, torrential bleeding swamps your view. If a major vessel like the carotid artery has been damaged, blood under pressure forces its way into the surrounding tissues, distorting everything. Boundaries between anatomical structures become obliterated and you lose your bearings. But if arteries are bad, veins are worse. Make a hole in one of those – their walls are paper-thin, so it's perilously easy to do – and an ominous whooshing gives you a second's warning that a tidal wave of blood is about to blot everything out. It's one of the most terrifying things that can happen.

With Jonas I'm picking my way through a morass of soggy tissue, trying to locate vital structures. As I probe and snip, I'm about to cut through some dreary-looking connective tissue. Something – I still don't know what – makes me stop and look again. I realize with a lurch that what I was about to divide is actually the internal jugular vein. This crucial vessel drains blood from the brain back to the heart, and cutting through it would be a disaster. A heart-stopping moment in every sense. I freeze, uncertain of what to do next. To gain time, I press hard with a swab and wait for my pulse to settle, thinking how close I just came to causing a catastrophe.

I try to summon my knowledge of neck anatomy. I should know it backwards. But I'm early in my surgical training and I haven't been operating solo for very long. The neck is scary territory at the best of times – even during a planned operation when you can see the tightly packed anatomy you've learned about from textbooks and in the dissecting room. But when someone has been stabbed, any certainty goes out of the window.

一天晚上，在索韦托的巴拉瓜纳医院，我开始给乔纳斯做手术。他的脖子被刺伤了。当时我来巴拉瓜纳医院的时间还不长。说「我感到焦虑」简直是轻描淡写。颈部受伤是出了名的棘手。颈动脉壁痉挛与临时产生的血块结合在一起，通常可以阻止最初的出血，而且起初看来，乔纳斯的伤口并不严重。一旦你移除血块，一阵一阵的血液像喷泉一样溅到你的脸上，这种令人安慰的安全感就突然消失了。在你弄清楚状况之前，如注的血流淹没了你的视野。如果像颈动脉这样的重要血管受损，血液会在血压的作用下进入周围的组织，让一切都变得扭曲起来。解剖结构之间的边界消失了，而你也会迷失方向。如果动脉状况不好，静脉就更糟糕了。要是在静脉上打个洞（静脉壁薄得像纸一样，所以极有这种可能性），一种不祥的嗖嗖声就会提前一秒给你警告：一股血浪马上就要涌出来染红一切。这是最可怕的事情之一。

给乔纳斯做手术，就像在湿软的沼泽里寻找出路，我试图找到重要的组织结构。我一边摸索一边剪，正要剪开一些看起来很可怕的结缔组织。某种原因（我现在依然不知道是什么原因）导致我停下来检查。我突然意识到，我正要剪开的东西其实是颈内静脉。这条重要的血管负责将血液从大脑运回心脏，剪断这条血管将是一场灾难。从任何意义上讲，这都是令人心悸的一刻。我呆住了，不知道接下来该做什么。为了争取时间，我用棉签用力按压，等待我的脉搏稳定下来，心想我差点儿酿成了一场灾难。

我努力回想我关于颈部解剖的知识。我应该倒背如流。但是，我的外科训练才开始不久，独立做手术的时间也不长。即使在理想的情况下，颈部也是个可怕的部位 —— 即使在计划好的手术中，在你能看到如同课本上和解剖室里学过的那些严密的解剖结构的情况下，也是如此。但如果有人被刀子捅了，就不存在任何确定性了。

### 6.1 单飞

Flying solo

Head and neck anatomy is unbelievably complicated; I wasn't alone in finding it confusing. In my first year as a medical student, I went to see our family doctor for something and mentioned I'd just started at medical school. He pulled down a pristine copy of Gray's Anatomy from his bookshelf and handed it to me. ‘Here,' he said, ‘you might as well have this – I won't need it. I never could learn the names of those little buggers in the neck. Still have nightmares about them. Good luck.' Soon, I found out exactly what he meant.

Years later, when I was teaching anatomy to medical students, I became more familiar with those little buggers in the neck. We spent a whole term on the head and neck. At last, I understood the ‘strap muscles' whose names seemed designed to confuse: sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid, thyrohyoid. I learned how the structures fitted into one another: the great arteries and veins taking blood to and from the brain; the nerves spreading out in all directions; the trachea taking air through the larynx to the lungs; and the treacherous oesophagus with its evil reputation as an unforgiving structure that was difficult to heal. Day after day, I guided groups of students through their dissections. By the end of that year, I had a pretty good idea about anatomy. I passed the primary exam for surgeons and felt smugly confident that those medical-school mists had dispersed. I'd memorized the names of all the little buggers and I knew exactly where to find them. At last, I knew it all. And it hadn't even been that difficult, really.

With Jonas on the operating table, I found out the difference between learning information and having knowledge. Anatomy in a living person is totally different from anatomy in a cadaver. I was way out of my depth, but there was no one to call on. I had to get on with it. I was flying solo and the stakes were real.

In this chapter we'll explore what happens when you're on the cusp between Apprentice and Journeyman. You've spent years on the early parts of the path I outlined in Chapter 1 . Until now, you've been learning to do things in the way they're done by others. You've been wrapped in a protective blanket. The people you work with know you'll make mistakes, because of your inexperience and lack of skill. As an Apprentice, you are at first only too aware of how little you know (the ‘conscious incompetence' I described in Chapter 3 ). Gradually, though, the technical difficulties start to recede. You're no longer having to use your full attention for everything, to concentrate so hard on what you're doing. You become more confident and you start to take things for granted. You are given licence to do more on your own. Eventually, you are on the verge of becoming independent, of moving into the Journeyman phase.

By this point you may think you know more than you actually do. You have become expert within the narrow compass of what your protected surroundings have allowed you to experience. Once those surroundings change, when you're out there on your own, you find you're up against challenges you didn't even know existed. Now you experience a different category of getting it wrong, one with serious consequences for all concerned. This is especially evident when the materials you work with are other people.

You can't help making mistakes – they're an inevitable part of becoming expert. When I started that operation on Jonas's neck I was beginning to take responsibility for my work, to lead operations on my own. But I was still wet behind the ears in terms of trauma surgery. Although I was gaining confidence, I didn't yet know how much I didn't know. All the experts I've worked with have similar stories of stopping just in time before something bad happens, of narrowly avoiding disaster.

Errors of this kind happen when you move from doing component tasks in someone else's workshop to taking responsibility for your work as a whole. That's the stage I'd reached when I was operating on Jonas. When you're at the limits of your competence and experience, but you have to carry on anyway, you're bound to make mistakes. Often, you notice in time and put it right. To improve, you have to expand the borders of your ability, and you'll only do that through work that stretches you. But sometimes bad things happen – work is damaged, people get hurt, your confidence is shattered.

Dealing with error involves interacting with people you may have disappointed in all kinds of ways. Fabrice the hairstylist describes these interactions in terms of psychological skills, as opposed to technical skills with scissors and comb. This chapter is about recognizing and responding when things are going wrong. No matter how many books you read, or how much advice people give you, you have to experience it for yourself. You have to learn to deal with that sick lurch when you realize you're on the verge of disaster. That's what happens when you go solo.

‘Flying solo' is a hackneyed shorthand for doing something on your own. But sometimes it's literal. While I was becoming a surgeon in Soweto, I learned to fly. It was a crazy thing to do but I loved it.

Every day as I drove to and from the hospital, I passed a tiny airfield next to the road. A battered sign said ‘Baragwanath Flying School'. One day, I went in. The flying school headquarters was a single-storey shack. One runway, no control tower, just a couple of tiny single-engine aeroplanes on the tarmac. It turned out that the school ran taster flights, where you could go up with an instructor for an hour to see if you liked it. I went up with Bill. A gruff, grizzled Afrikaner, he had been flying for decades and had seen it all. We took off in a two-seater, with me in the co-pilot's seat with its dual controls. Once we had gained some height, Bill pointed out the hospital below us and the skyline of Johannesburg in the distance. It was magical. Then he allowed me to fly the plane.

Of course, I wasn't really flying it – certainly not in the sense of taking any responsibility. But I was using the stick and the rudder, making the aircraft bank and turn; using my senses and learning about space and about other people. I had a glimpse of the mise en place of the cockpit and the other planes in the sky that we needed to avoid. Back on terra firma, I signed up for lessons on the spot.

The plane was a Cessna 152, one of the smallest you could get. It was like a second-hand car with wings, and its call sign was Kilo Sierra Lima (KSL). Over the next few months I came to know KSL extremely well. To begin with, all I did was ‘circuits and bumps'. Bill and I spent hours taking off and landing, again and again, not stopping after we'd touched down but opening the throttle and taking off for another ‘circuit'. I got to know that circuit by heart – a notional rectangle above the runway, each component with its technical name of crosswind leg, downwind leg, base leg and final approach. Time after time I went through the checklist procedures for taking off, gaining height, adjusting to the weather conditions, landing, then doing it all again. Crosswind landings. Flaps up, flaps down.

One day, after yet another set of take-offs and landings, Bill told me to stop. I thought I must have done something wrong and braced myself for a dressing-down. Instead, he got out of the cockpit and closed his door. ‘I'll be in the school building,' he said. ‘Let me know when you're back.' Before I'd realized quite what was happening, I'd taken off and was looking down at the flying school, this time on my own.

Everything changes when you're up there alone. All those lessons, that theory, those procedures become a blur. It's just you, and there's no Bill making tiny adjustments as you come in to land. But somehow things fell into place, I landed safely and brought KSL to a standstill. This moment occurs in the path of every expert. At a certain point, everybody has to stand on their own two feet.

After that, my confidence started to grow. I went out to the airfield on my own in the early mornings before work. I put in the hours I needed. I practised getting in and out of incipient spins and recovering from stalls. Eventually the day came for my flying test. The examiner put me through my paces. I showed I could take off on a short runway in a crosswind, navigate along a flight path, and make an emergency landing if the engine failed. I proudly received my Private Pilot Licence and couldn't wait to start using it.

Soon after that, I made a blunder that could have killed me and hundreds of others.

头部和颈部的解剖结构复杂到了难以置信的程度，我并不是唯一对此感到困惑的人。在我上医学院的第一年里，我去看我们的家庭医生，提到我刚刚开始上医学院。他从书架上抽出一本崭新的《格氏解剖学》（Gray's Anatomy）递给我。「拿着，」他说，「还是给你吧，我用不上了。我永远也记不住那些脖子里的小东西的名字。我到现在还会做有关它们的噩梦。祝你好运。」

很快，我就完完全全地明白了他的意思。

多年以后，我在给医学生讲授解剖学的时候，我对脖子里的小东西更加熟悉了。我们花了整整一学期的时间在头颈部。最后，我弄懂了那些「带状肌」，这些名称似乎是故意让人混淆的：胸骨舌骨肌、胸骨甲状肌、肩胛舌骨肌、甲状舌骨肌。我了解了这些结构是如何相互配合的：大动脉和大静脉将血液送至和送出大脑，神经向四面八方扩散，气管将空气经由喉部送到肺部，还有难以捉摸的食道 —— 它是出了名的难伺候，一旦受伤很难愈合。我日复一日地指导学生做解剖。到了那年年底，我对解剖学有了相当不错的了解。我通过了外科医生的初级院士考试，沾沾自喜地以为医学院的苦日子终于到头了。我已经记住了所有那些小东西的名字，也知道它们的确切位置。终于，我全都懂了。事实上，这并没有那么困难。

站在乔纳斯的手术台边，我发现了学会信息和拥有知识之间的区别。活人的解剖结构与尸体的截然不同。这件事超出了我的能力范围，但我没有人可以求助。我必须硬着头皮做下去。我已经独当一面了，面临的风险是真真切切的。

在本章中，我们将探讨你在学徒与熟练工的交界处会遇到的事情。你已经花了多年时间在第 1 章概述的早期道路上跋涉。到目前为止，你一直在学习别人做事的方式。你被包裹在一个保护罩里。和你一起工作的人知道你会犯错，因为你缺乏经验和技能。作为一名学徒，一开始你很清楚自己所知甚少（即我在第 3 章中描述过的「有意识的无能」）。不过，技能上的困难会逐渐消退。你不再需要全神贯注地做每件事情，努力把精力集中在你手头的事上。你变得更加自信，开始习惯事情的常态。

你可以独立做更多的事情了。最后，你来到了独立的边缘，准备进入「熟练工」阶段。

这时，你可能认为自己知道的比实际上更多。在受保护的环境所允许的狭窄范围内，你已经成为专家。一旦那些环境发生变化，当你独当一面的时候，你会发现你面对的挑战是自己以前从未意识到的。你会有一种不同的犯错体验，这种错误会给所有相关的人带来严重的后果。如果你的工作对象是其他人，这一点尤其明显。

你无法避免犯错 —— 犯错是成为专家的必经之路。我在给乔纳斯的脖子动手术时，已经开始为自己的工作负责了，独立担任主刀医生。但是，在创伤外科方面，我还很稚嫩。虽然我越来越有信心，但我还不知道我有多少不知道的东西。与我打过交道的所有专家都有类似的经历：在糟糕的事情发生之前及时停下来，侥幸逃过灾难。

当你不再在别人的工坊里负责部分任务，而开始为整体工作负责时，就会犯这样的错误。这就是我在给乔纳斯做手术时所处的阶段。你已经达到了自己能力与经验的极限，却不得不继续推进，你必然会犯错。通常情况下，你会及时发现并纠正错误。为了提高自己，你必须扩大自己的能力范围，而你只能通过挑战自己来做到这一点。有时糟糕的事情会发生 —— 工作搞砸了，有人受伤了，你的信心也受到了打击。

处理错误，需要你和出于各种原因而对你失望的人打交道。发型设计师法布里斯认为这些互动需要心理技能，而不是用剪刀和梳子的专业技能。这一章讲的就是在事情出错时你要如何识别并做出反应。无论你读过多少书，或者别人给了你多少建议，你都必须亲身体验。你必须学会在意识到自己面临灾难时如何应对那种难受的、心中一惊的感觉。这就是你在「单飞」时会遇到的事情。

「单飞」是独立做某件事的简略说法，但有时它就是字面上的意思。我在索韦托学做外科医生的时候，学会了开飞机。这是一件疯狂的事情，但我很喜欢。

每天我开车前往和离开医院的路上，都会经过一座小机场。一块破破烂烂的牌子上写着「巴拉瓜纳飞行学校」。有一天，我进去了。这所飞行学校的总部是一间单层的棚屋。这里只有一条跑道，没有控制塔，还有几架小型单引擎飞机停在停机坪上。原来这里开设了试航课程，你可以跟教练一起飞上一个小时，看看自己是否喜欢。我和比尔一起去了试航。比尔是一个性情粗鲁、头发花白的南非白人，几十年来一直在开飞机，见多识广。我们开的是一架双座飞机，我坐在副驾驶的位置上，也有一套控制系统。我们爬升到一定高度时，比尔指给我看下面的医院和远方约翰内斯堡的轮廓。这种感觉很奇妙。然后他允许我来开飞机。

当然，我不是真的在开飞机 —— 显然我不必承担任何责任。但是我在操作操纵杆和方向舵，让飞机倾斜和转向；我在运用自己的感官，了解空间与他人。我领略了驾驶舱内的「准备工作」，也瞥见了天空中我们需要避开的其他飞机。回到坚实的陆地上后，我立即报名参加了课程。

那架飞机的型号是塞斯纳 152，是你能找到的最小的飞机之一。它就像一辆有机翼的二手车，它的呼号是 KSL，即基洛·谢拉·利马（Kilo Sierra Lima）。在接下来的几个月里，我对 KSL 变得非常了解。一开始，我只能做「绕圈与降落」。

比尔和我花了好几个小时练习起飞和降落，一遍又一遍。我们在着陆后没有停下来，而是打开节气门，起飞做另一次「绕圈」。我对绕圈的线路已经烂熟于心了 —— 跑道上方的一个假想的长方形，每条边都有专门的名称，如二边、三边、四边和五边。

我一次又一次地按步骤起飞、爬升、适应天气状况、降落，然后再做一遍。侧风着陆。打开襟翼，放下襟翼。

有一天，在又一次起飞和降落之后，比尔让我停下来。我想我一定是做错了什么，准备挨一顿骂。然而，他走出驾驶舱，关上了舱门。「我去教学楼里，」他说，「你回来时告诉我一声。」

我还没有意识到发生了什么，就已经起飞了。我俯视着飞行学校，这次我是独自一人。当你在天上独自一人的时候，一切都变了。所有的课程、理论、操作步骤都变得模糊起来。天上只有你自己，在降落时不会有比尔做微小的调整。但不知为何，一切都很顺利，我安全着陆了，让 KSL 稳稳地停了下来。在每个人成为专家的道路上都会有这一时刻。从某个时间点起，每个人都得自力更生。

从那以后，我的信心开始增长。清晨上班前，我会一个人前往机场。我花了足够的时间积累。我练习了进入和改出初始螺旋状态，并从失速中恢复。终于到了我飞行测试的那天。考官考查了各项科目。我展示了侧风短跑道起飞，沿航线飞行，并且在引擎故障的情况下緊急迫降。我自豪地获得了私人飞机驾驶执照，并迫不及待地想使用它。

不久之后，我犯了一个可能会害死自己和几百个其他人的错误。

### 6.2 纠正错误

Recovering from error

Everyone makes errors. Nobody sets out to make them, but that's how life is and that's how we learn. So far in the book we've looked at practising your craft within a setting which protects you and has safeguards against too much harm. Fabrice started by shampooing, and Joshua began with pocket flaps. I didn't leap in by operating on stab wounds to the neck. I started with straightforward clinical procedures, like taking blood. As a medical student and a junior doctor, there were always people I could call on – though in the culture of the time I didn't unless I had no choice. But everyone knew I was learning and they made allowances. If I was really stuck I could call for help, and the only damage would be to my pride.

But there comes a point when you have to take direct responsibility for your work. You fetch up against the consequences of that work, especially when its focus is other people. You are having to make decisions in a world which no longer makes allowances for your mistakes. You chose to go there, and you have to deal with it.

Sometimes you find yourself out of your depth, your usual landmarks erased. Sometimes, as I discovered in that operation on Jonas's stabbed neck, you stop on the edge of disaster. But sometimes you don't stop, and bad things happen.

It's how you learn from your mistakes that counts. That's easy enough to say, but it's difficult to cope with when you damage someone else through your inexperience or inattention. Not all my own mistakes were medical. For one of my more spectacular blunders we'll go back to Baragwanath Flying School, where my first major error was nearly my last.

Soon after I got my pilot's licence, I took off in KSL on a short hop to Rand Airport. Rand was one of several large airports in Johannesburg but I'd never been there before. My flying school was so small it didn't have a control tower, and I wanted to practise flying to somewhere larger. My instructor Bill told me, ‘You can't miss Rand Airport. Just turn left at the silver water tower soon after take-off and you'll see the runway ahead of you.'

I took off, saw the silver water tower and turned left. At first I couldn't spot the airport, so I kept going for a bit longer. Eventually I saw a sizeable runway. Although it was a little to one side of where I was expecting, I radioed Rand Airport tower, got clearance and landed. The runway seemed very long as I was taxiing along it, but it was only when I passed a row of jumbo jets and a sign saying ‘Welcome to Johannesburg International Airport' that I realized I'd landed unannounced at one of the continent's busiest airports instead of the one I was aiming for. Soon after that my radio crackled into life, with a furious voice barking ‘Kilo Sierra Lima, Kilo Sierra Lima, do you read me?'

I parked my little Cessna in front of the tower, then spent the next half hour in a most uncomfortable interview with the air traffic controller and his team. By sheer luck it had been a quiet afternoon, with no passenger aircraft scheduled to take off or land. If I'd come down in the path of an incoming airliner I could have caused a catastrophic crash, killing myself and a planeload of others.

The only reason I wasn't crucified was that the tower crew had relaxed their normal vigilance and hadn't noticed me coming until I'd actually landed. Red faces all round. Although the primary fault was mine, the safety net that should have picked up my mistake early had failed too. So after a severe dressing-down I was allowed to get back into KSL, much chastened, and fly back to Baragwanath airfield.

As soon as I landed, I told Bill what I had done. Bill was not known for his sensitivity and I braced myself for a tirade. But to my astonishment he burst into laughter, took me into a private room, produced a bottle from somewhere, poured us both a glass and started to tell me about the time he wrote off a twin-engine plane by forgetting to put down the undercarriage. More stories followed and I realized that, by making my mistake, I had moved one step nearer the centre of a community of practice. I'd joined the company of pilots who had made errors they didn't normally talk about; people who know that error is inevitable but who only tell you about theirs when you've made one yourself – just like surgeons.

Bill didn't minimize the seriousness of my mistake. It could have been horrendous, and it was sheer luck that I didn't cause a major disaster. But he realized that I needed to use that experience to become a better pilot, not let it make me lose my nerve so I never flew again.

人人都会犯错。没有人愿意犯错，但这就是生活的真相，也是我们学习的方式。到目前为止，我们在本书中讨论的是在一个保护你的环境中练习你的技艺，防止你造成太大的损害。在最开始的时候，法布里斯只需要给客人洗头，而约书亚只用制作袋盖。我也不会一开始就给脖子上的刺伤动手术。我从最简单的临床操作做起，比如采血。在做医学生和实习医生的时候，总有我可以求助的人 —— 不过在当时的环境氛围里，不到万不得已，我是不会求助的。每个人都知道我在学习，他们对我有一定的宽容。如果我真的陷入了困境，我可以求助，唯一受损的只有我的自尊。

但是总有一天，你必须对自己的工作负直接责任。你要直面工作的后果，尤其是在工作的重心是其他人的情况下。你必须在一个不再宽容你犯错的世界里做决定。这是你自己的选择，你必须面对。

有时你会发现自己力不从心，平常熟悉的参照物已不复存在。有时候，就像我在手术台旁面对乔纳斯脖子上的刺伤一样，你也会在酿成大错之前停下来。但有时你停不下来，糟糕的事情就会发生。

重要的是你如何从错误中学习。这说起来很容易，但当你因为经验不足或注意力不集中而伤害到别人时，你就很难应对了。并非我所有的错误都与医学有关。要说起我犯的一个很严重的错误，就得回到巴拉瓜纳飞行学校。在那里，我犯下的第一个严重错误，几乎就成了我这辈子犯的最后一个错误。

我拿到飞机执照后不久，就 KSL 飞往不远的兰德机场。兰德机场是约翰内斯堡的几个大型机场之一，但我从没去过那儿。我的飞行学校很小，连控制塔都没有，所以我想去更大的地方练习飞行。教练比尔告诉我：「兰德机场绝对不容错过。起飞不久后在银色水塔处左转，你就能看到前方的跑道。」

我起飞了，看到了银色水塔就向左转。起初我找不到机场，于是又向前飞了一段。最后我看到了一条相当宽敞的跑道。不过这条跑道有些偏向一侧，和我想的不太一样，我用无线电通知了兰德机场控制塔，得到了许可，然后降落了。跑道似乎很长，我沿着跑道滑行。我经过了一排喷气式飞机，看到一个标志上写着「欢迎来到约翰内斯堡国际机场」，这时我才意识到我未经知会就降落在了这片陆地最繁忙的机场上，而不是我原本的目的地。很快我的无线电响了起来，一个愤怒的声音喊道：

「基洛·谢拉·利马，基洛·谢拉·利马，你能听到吗？」

我把我的小塞斯纳飞机停在了控制塔前，然后花了半个小时与空中交通管制员和他的团队进行了一次非常难堪的访谈。

非常幸运的是，当天下午机场并不繁忙，没有一架客机要起飞或降落。如果我在一架飞机的行进路线上降落，可能就会造成灾难性的事故，害死我自己和对面飞机上的其他人。

我没有受到严惩的唯一原因是，控制塔上的工作人员也放松了警惕，直到我着陆时才注意到我。周围的每个人都气冲冲的。虽然主要责任在我，但本应及早发现我犯错的安全保障措施也失效了。所以，在接受严厉的训斥之后，我更加警醒了，他们允许我回到 KSL，飞回巴拉瓜纳机场。

一下飞机，我就告诉了比尔我所做的事情。照顾别人的感受不是比尔的长项，我准备好接受他喋喋不休的训斥了。可让我惊讶的是，他却哈哈大笑起来，把我带进一间私人房间，不知从哪儿拿出一瓶酒，给我们俩各倒上一杯，讲起了他有一次因为忘记放下起落架而毁掉一架双引擎飞机的故事。然后他又讲了更多的故事，而我意识到，由于犯了错误，我朝着实践社群的中心又迈进了一步。我加入了老练飞行员的行列，他们都犯过一些通常不愿谈论的错误，他们知道错误是不可避免的，但只有在你犯了错误之后才会告诉你他们的错误 —— 就像外科医生一样。

比尔并没有淡化我的错误的严重性。这件事可能会带来可怕的后果，幸运的是我没有酿成大祸。但他知道我需要利用这段经历来成为一名更好的飞行员，而不是让这件事浇灭我的勇气，以至于再也不敢飞行。

### 6.3 剖析错误

Dissecting error

Although technically categorized as a ‘near miss', my error with KSL was way beyond the ‘normal' margin of error that beginners find themselves in. Nothing like it had ever happened at that airport – no aircraft would ever arrive at a large airport like that without making radio contact long before coming into view. Because my mistake was so egregious, it had never occurred to me or anyone else that it might even happen. The control tower team and I were both working within what we were expecting, and the unfamiliar floored us. I was focusing on my procedures for landing, without asking if I was at the right place. It was the aviation equivalent of doing a perfect operation on the wrong patient.

My near misses in surgery were of a different kind. These were caused by finding myself in unfamiliar terrain and not knowing what to do. When I was operating on Jonas, I found it impossible to recognize the usual landmarks. I'd operated on the neck before, but now the neck looked different.

Another night at Bara I was operating on a patient with penetrating chest and abdominal wounds. I didn't even know his name at the time, as he was almost dead from blood loss when he arrived. We had to take him straight to theatre. As I finished dealing with his abdominal injuries, his condition plummeted and I realized I had to go into his chest. The knife that stabbed him must have been a long one as there was bleeding from the great vessels near the heart. I hadn't seen much thoracic surgery, let alone done any, and yet again I was way outside my comfort zone. But there was no alternative, so I carried on.

Thoracic surgery is a specialized field and needs specialized instruments. After opening the chest, I found that blood was hosing from one of the large vessels to the lung. I could see where it was coming from, and I needed to stop it fast if my patient was to survive.

In this kind of emergency you can't take your eye off the site of injury, and your scrub nurse plays a vital role by putting what you need into your hand. On this occasion, the nurse with me hadn't done much thoracic surgery either. I asked for an angled clamp to control the bleeding, held out my hand and felt the instrument's handle hit my palm. I was just about to place it across the fragile vessel when I realized that, instead of the soft vascular clamp I was expecting, she had given me a bronchial clamp. This has murderous spikes in its jaws, designed to grasp the stiff cartilage of the air passages. It would have cut the delicate pulmonary vessels to shreds. To this day, I can feel the pounding of my heart as I realized what a narrow escape my patient and I had both just had.

My near misses in the operating theatre and in the air have similarities and differences. Thinking back to when I arrived unannounced at Johannesburg International Airport, I can identify several classic types of blunder. Landing at the wrong airport was an error through simple inexperience. The weather was fine; there was no obvious problem. I should have known better, but I didn't have the experience to recognize key signals and respond appropriately. I just hadn't learned enough. When I took off from Baragwanath airfield I was using my attentional capacity to fly the plane, talk on the radio and look out for the silver water tower. I didn't have a clear sense of where I was going, and I hadn't been there before. I took the advice of people who were more experienced than I was, people who assumed my knowledge was like theirs. For them, ‘turn left at the silver water tower' told them all they needed to know. But what I needed to know was what to do after turning left. It didn't occur to me that there might be more than one airport in the vicinity. Though I'd studied the aerial charts until I was sick of them while I was swotting for my Private Pilot Licence, I hadn't made the connection.

On top of that, I was anxious. When I did see a runway, I was so relieved that I jumped to the conclusion that it was the right one, even though it wasn't exactly where I expected. Instead of questioning my assumptions, I over-focused on landing the plane. This ties in with Daniel Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 thinking. In my case, I worked according to System 1 – the fast, automatic way – when I should have been using System 2, the painstaking effortful approach which analyses factors systematically.

It is frighteningly easy to make assumptions. In surgical training you spend a long time learning anatomy, mostly from textbooks. This is highly detailed knowledge and it provides a reassuring sense of certainty. But that certainty can be illusory. You think in terms of ‘a gastrectomy' (removing the stomach) – of descriptions you have seen in books and other patients you have been involved with. But you can't know what this patient's stomach will be like until you see it for yourself.

In Chapter 4 I described the need to look, really look, at what's in front of you, rather than seeing what you expect to find. As my experience in the air showed me, when you're feeling vulnerable – uncertain, out of your depth, tired, and all the other things the books don't mention – this is the very time when you need to take note of warning signs and not just plough on. Luckily, that's what I did with Jonas as I was about to divide his internal jugular vein. But sometimes you are forced out of your comfort zone because the circumstances are beyond your control. You find yourself in territory you wouldn't have chosen and you cannot avoid. If you're lucky you can call for help, but often you just have to deal with it.

Error has a bad name, but it's both important and unavoidable. The challenge is not to eliminate it but to minimize the damage it causes. There's a difference between ‘bad error' (those harmful mistakes that should have been avoided) and ‘honourable error' (when you try something and it doesn't work). There's no shame in honourable error. On the contrary, it's how people move forward. Error then becomes something to learn from, something to be experienced, corrected and reshaped, rather than avoided altogether. Nobody sets out to make mistakes, but learning from error is an essential part of becoming expert. It's how you improve. Error and failure are not the same.

虽然严格来讲，这次属于「未遂事故」，但我驾驶 KSL 所犯的错误远远超出了初学者犯错的「正常」范围。那座机场里从没发生过类似的事情 —— 没有一架飞机能直接降落在一座大型机场，而不在进入视线范围前早早地用无线电联络。由于我的错误太严重了，我和其他人都没想过会发生这样的事情。控制塔团队和我都在按计划做事，这种不熟悉的情况让我们措手不及。我只想着降落的步骤，而没有考虑我是否降落在了正确的地点。这就好比在错误的患者身上做了一台完美的手术。

我在手术中的「未遂事故」与此不同。这些「未遂事故」的原因是我发现自己处在陌生的情况里，不知道该做什么。在给乔纳斯做手术时，我无法辨认出熟悉的参照物。我以前做过颈部手术，但现在乔纳斯的脖子看起来完全不同。

在巴拉瓜纳医院的另一个晚上，我在给一个胸部有穿透伤，腹部也有伤口的患者做手术。当时我连他的名字都不知道，因为他到医院时已经因为失血过多而奄奄一息了。我们只好直接把他送进手术室。我刚处理完他腹部的伤口，他的情况就急转直下，我意识到我必须做开胸手术。刺伤他的那把刀一定很长，因为靠近心脏的大血管正在出血。我没见过多少胸外科手术，更别提动手做了，我又一次离开了自己的舒适区。但我别无选择，只能迎难而上。

胸外科是一个专业的领域，做手术需要专门的器械。打开胸腔之后，我发现血液正在从一根连接肺部的大血管里喷涌而出。我能看到出血的位置，如果想要患者活下来，我就需要迅速止血。

在这种紧急情况下，你必须目不转睛地盯着伤处，你的洗手护士则要扮演重要的角色，把你需要的东西放在你的手上。

在当时，与我合作的护士也没有做过多少胸外科手术。我想要一个弯的夹钳来止血，我伸出手去，感到夹钳的手柄拍在了我的手掌上。我正要用夹钳去夹脆弱的血管，这时我才意识到，护士给我的不是我想要的软血管钳，而是支气管钳。这种夹钳的钳口上有尖利的刺，是用来夹呼吸道里较硬的软骨的。它会把脆弱的肺血管夹碎。时至今日，我依然能感觉到我在意识到患者死里逃生、我险些酿成大错时的心跳。

我在手术室内与驾驶飞机时的「未遂事故」既有相似也有不同。回想起我未经知会就降落在约翰内斯堡国际机场时的场景，我能找出几种典型的错误。降落在错误的机场纯粹是由于缺乏经验造成的错误。当时天气很好，没有明显的问题。我应该做得更好，但我没有识别关键信号并做出适当反应的经验。我学得还不够。我从巴拉瓜纳机场起飞时，把全部注意力都放在了驾驶飞机、无线电通话和寻找银色水塔上。我不清楚我要去哪儿，我以前没去过那里。我听取了一些比我更有经验的人的建议，他们以为我的经验与他们相当。对他们来说，只需要知道「到了银色水塔处左转」就足够了，但我需要知道左转之后该做什么。我没有想到附近会有不止一座机场。虽然在备考私人飞机驾驶执照时，我一直在研究航空图，直到不胜其烦，但我没有意识到这一点。

最重要的是，我当时很焦虑。当我看到跑道时，我如释重负，草率地认为我到达了正确的机场，但事实出乎了我的意料。我没有质疑自己的假设，而是过于关注飞机的降落。这种情况与丹尼尔·卡尼曼所说的系统 1 与系统 2 思维有关。在我的例子里，我在按照系统 1（快速的、自动化的方式）工作，但我实际上应该使用系统 2（全面分析各项因素的、勤勉、努力的方式）。

做假设是非常容易的。在外科训练中，你要花很长时间学习解剖学，主要是从课本上学习。这是非常详细的知识，提供了一种令人安心的确定性，但这种确定性可能是虚幻的。你脑子里全是「胃切除术」（切除胃部的手术）这样的术语 —— 你想到的是书中的描述，以及你接触过的其他患者。但如果你不亲自去见识，就不知道眼前这位患者的胃是什么样子。

在第 4 章中，我谈到了「看」，真正的「看见」你眼前的东西，而不是只看到你希望发现的东西。我开飞机的经历告诉我，你感到脆弱的时候 —— 感到不确定、力不从心、疲惫以及所有其他书里没提到的感觉时，正是你需要注意报警信号而不是埋头苦干的时候。幸运的是，我在给乔纳斯做手术时正是这样做的，我差点就切开了他的颈内静脉。有时你会被迫离开自己的舒适区，因为环境是你无法控制的。你会发现自己置身于不愿选择、无法回避的境地。如果你够幸运，就可以向人求助，但通常你只能独立应对。

错误看似很糟糕，但它既重要又不可避免。我们面临的挑战不是消除错误，而是将它造成的损害降到最低。「糟糕的错误」与「可敬的错误」是有区别的。前者是指那些本可以避免的有害错误，而后者是指你尝试了某些事情却失败了。「可敬的错误」并不可耻。相反，这是大家进步的方式。这样一来，错误就变成了需要学习、体验、纠正和重塑的东西，而不是需要彻底避免的东西。没有人以犯错为目标，但从错误中学习是成为专家的必经之路。这是你进步的方式。错误与失败不是一回事。

### 6.4 假设的危险

The danger of making assumptions

At around the time I was landing at the wrong airport, Fabrice the hairstylist was starting with his last client of the day in the salon where he was completing his training. The pressure was on to finish quickly so that the salon could close on time. By now Fabrice had gained a lot of technical skill. He was expert with scissors and comb, with handling different kinds of hair. After years of apprenticeship he hardly had to think about what he was doing, and he could keep up a conversation on autopilot while he worked.

On this occasion, his client was a middle-aged woman with shortish hair. Partway through, he suddenly realized that he'd cut the hair on her crown too short. Hairstylists have a saying, ‘When it's too short, it's too late'; that day, Fabrice had that sinking feeling I'd experienced many times in the operating theatre.

To an outsider, hairstyling seems to be about technique, about shaping and snipping. In fact, the most important part is design. Everyone's hair grows differently and those growth patterns are crucial, especially on the crown. If you get that wrong you'll create something that may look reasonable at first but quickly becomes distorted as the hair grows. It's especially challenging with shorter hair, where even a millimetre can make a huge difference.

Fabrice had made an unforced error and now he had to handle it. Building on the relationship he had developed with this client over previous visits, he was straightforward. ‘I've made it a little shorter than we planned,' he said, ‘and perhaps I misjudged the growth pattern. In two weeks' time it should be fine, but today it will look a bit shorter than you expected. Will you be OK with that?' The client wasn't pleased, but she accepted Fabrice's explanation. The next time she made an appointment she even insisted on being styled by him again.

Fabrice made that mistake through overconfidence. Relying on the techniques he was beginning to master, he overlooked the need to check and recheck whether he was doing the right thing. Later, he discovered that all stylists make errors of this kind, even when they are extremely experienced. Fabrice had become part of a community of stylists who had made errors. Even the most famous are not immune. The fashion designer Mary Quant once described having her hair cut by the iconic stylist Vidal Sassoon in the 1960s. ‘One night,' Quant recalled, ‘[he] was cutting my hair to promote his new five-point geometric bob, in the presence of various Press photographers. Spurred on by the vast audience, he went whap! – and cut my ear. Just the fat bit – and nothing bleeds more.'

Joshua the tailor made mistakes at this stage of his career too. When he'd just finished his second apprenticeship and was starting to work as a qualified tailor, he deliberately sought out challenging customers in order to gain experience. One of these was a man who suffered a physical disability and had an unusual body shape. He and Joshua decided on a design for his suit, then Joshua began a series of fittings. By the third fitting he discovered that things were getting worse, not better.

Joshua was skilled in making suits for average-looking people, but he didn't yet have the experience to deal with outliers. He realized that he'd never be able to make the successful suit he had in mind by tinkering with what he'd created so far. His fundamental design, based on a man of more usual proportions, was an error. Bravely, he decided to scrap what he'd done, go back to the beginning and start again from scratch. He was able to use what he'd learned from that false start to come up with a different design. In the end, the suit was a success, and the customer was delighted. But Joshua had to recognize when his situation needed a radical rethink rather than fiddling. He'd had to write off everything he had done so far – the materials, the work of the making tailors, his time and his customer's time – and that took guts. But his priority was to do the best work possible, and he could only do that by starting again. So Joshua moved out of the frame he had been working in – the approaches he'd been taught and the assumptions he'd grown used to – and set up a different one. This is difficult to do, but it's an essential part of improving. That ability to change frames is a marker of becoming expert.

I experienced something similar after I'd been a GP for several years. One of my patients came to see me because she was tired. Bethany was in her forties, with a family and a busy career. There was nothing specific in her history apart from some indigestion. I arranged a blood test which confirmed that she was anaemic, so the next step was to find out why. I had a niggling worry that there might be something more serious going on, as I'd known Bethany for years and she didn't look quite right. So, because of the indigestion, I referred her to a gastroenterologist. He arranged various tests including an endoscopy (passing a flexible tube into the stomach and another into the rectum), and all the results came back normal. He reassured Bethany that nothing was wrong. But a few months later she saw me again because her tiredness was getting worse.

Although the hospital consultant had given her the green light, I realized that was only from his perspective as a specialist. When he said there was nothing wrong, he meant nothing wrong with her digestive system – not that there was nothing wrong at all. As a GP, my job was to step back and think whether we'd been asking the right questions. Maybe her problem was not with her digestive system but another part of her body altogether.

In the end, it turned out that Bethany had an early cancer of the uterus. Luckily, we caught it in time and she was fine, but I could easily have missed it. It is surprisingly easy to start down a path from the initial framing of a problem and stay within that set of assumptions. I had to learn to stop, rewind and think again – to check whether I was treating the right problem.

I'm sure we've all made errors through assumption, treating a symptom rather than its cause. When a light goes out in the house, your immediate response is to change the bulb. But when that bulb blows too, you have to look for a different explanation. It happened with the battered old Morris Minor van I used to drive as a student. One day it coughed and died by the side of the road. The petrol gauge said ‘Full', so I knew that couldn't be the problem. I called the roadside rescue service and the first thing the mechanic did was pour in some petrol from a can. The car started without a murmur and I felt like a complete idiot. It turned out that my petrol gauge was faulty and had stuck on ‘Full'.

就在我降落在错误机场的时候，发型设计师法布里斯在他学艺的美发店里，正准备给当天的最后一位客人服务。他感到有些压力，因为要尽快完工，这样美发店才能按时关门。此时法布里斯已经掌握了许多专业技能。他擅长使用剪刀和梳子，擅长处理不同类型的头发。经历了多年的学徒生涯，他几乎不用思考自己在做什么，可以在工作的同时与人自如地交谈。

这一次，他的客人是一位短发的中年妇女。剪到一半，他突然发现他把客人头顶上的头发剪得太短了。发型设计师常说：「剪得太短，为时已晚。」那天，法布里斯有了一种我在手术室里体验过多次的沉重感。

在外行人看来，发型设计好像是关乎技术的，关乎造型与修剪。事实上，最重要的部分是设计。每个人的头发都长得不一样，这种生长的模式是至关重要的，尤其是头顶的头发。如果你不顺应这种规律，就会剪出一些看起来很合理的发型，但很快就会随着头发的生长而变形。对于较短的发型来说，这一点尤其具有挑战性，即使一毫米的偏差也能产生巨大的影响。法布里斯出现了失误，现在他必须处理这个错误。他之前与这位客人建立了一定的关系，于是他直言不讳。「我剪得比预计的短了些，」他说，「可能我看错了头发的生长模式。两周后应该就没问题了，但今天头发会看起来比您预想的要短一些。您可以接受吗？」客人不太满意，但她接受了法布里斯的解释。下次预约时，她甚至坚持要法布里斯来给她剪发。

法布里斯犯这种错误的原因是过度自信。由于过度依赖自己逐渐掌握的各项技能，他忘记了应该反复检查自己做得是否正确。后来他发现，所有发型设计师都会犯这种错误，即使经验非常丰富的人也不例外。法布里斯成了犯过错误的发型设计师社群中的一员。即使最著名的发型设计师也不能幸免。时装设计师玛丽·奎恩特（Mary Quant）曾讲过著名发型设计师维达·沙宣（Vidal Sassoon）在 20 世纪 60 年代给自己剪发的经历。「一天晚上，」奎恩特回忆道，「他当着各路摄影记者的面给我剪发，宣传他新设计的‘五点几何波波头'。在大批观众的刺激下，他大刀阔斧地剪了下来 —— 剪到了我的耳朵。剪到了肉最多的那部分，我从没流过这么多血。」

裁缝约书亚在职业生涯的这个阶段也犯过错误。当时他刚刚结束自己的第二次学徒生涯，成为一名有资质的裁缝。他故意寻找有挑战性的顾客，以积累经验。其中一位顾客是残疾人，他的体型很不寻常。他和约书亚决定了西装的款式，然后开始试穿。在第三次试穿时，约书亚发觉衣服变得更不合身了，而不是更合身。

约书亚擅长为普通人制作西装，但还没有与这类身材不同寻常的人工作的经验。他意识到，他不可能把现在这件西装修改成他想象中的样子。他的设计是以更常见的身材比例为基础的，这是一个错误。他勇敢地决定放弃目前所做的一切，重新开始。他利用他从失败中学到的东西，做出了一个不同的设计。最后，他成功了，顾客很高兴。但是，要做到这一点，约书亚必须认识到自己的处境需要彻底转变思路，而不是小修小补。他必须放弃当时所做的一切，包括材料、制作裁缝的工作、他和顾客的时间，而这需要勇气。不过他的首要任务是把工作尽可能做好，而他只有重新开始才能达到这个目标。于是约书亚跳出了他工作中的窠臼 —— 他学到的方法与习惯的假设，采用了另一种思路。这很难做到，但这也是进步的重要组成部分。

这种改变思路的能力是成为专家的标志。

做了几年全科医生后，我也有了类似的经历。有一位名叫贝萨妮的患者前来找我，因为她感觉很累。她当时 40 多岁，需要照顾家庭，为事业奔忙。除了消化不良，她的病史里没有什么具体问题。我安排了一次验血，结果表明她有贫血，所以下一步就是找出原因。我有点儿担心她可能会有更严重的问题。我认识贝萨妮很多年了，她看起来有些不对劲。由于她消化不良，我把她转诊给了肠胃科医生。肠胃科医生安排了各项检查，包括内窥镜检查（把一根软管伸入胃中，另一根伸入直肠），结果都是正常的。他向贝萨妮保证一切正常。但几个月后，贝萨妮又来见我，因为她越来越累了。

虽然医院的肠胃科顾问医师说她没有问题，但我意识到，这只是因为他是从专科医生的角度来看待问题的。他说贝萨妮没有问题，他的意思其实是她的消化系统没有问题 —— 并不是说她完全没有问题。作为全科医生，我的工作是后退一步，思考我们是否提出了正确的问题。也许她的问题不在于消化系统，而完全在于身体的其他部分。

最后，事实证明贝萨妮患有早期子宫癌。幸运的是，我们发现得很及时，她也恢复了健康，但我当时很可能会忽视这个问题。我们非常容易从问题的初始思路出发，并一直坚持那套假设。我必须学会停下来、后退、重新思考 —— 检查我是否在治疗正确的问题。

我相信我们都曾坚持过错误的假设，治疗患者的症状而非找出导致症状的原因。房子里的灯熄灭时，你的第一反应是换灯泡。但是如果你换的灯泡也坏了，那你就得寻找其他的解释了。我在学生时代开的那辆破旧的莫里斯小型面包车也出现过这样的问题。有一天，这辆车嘎吱一声，在路边抛锚了。燃油表上显示「满」，所以我知道那不是问题的原因。我给道路救援机构打了电话，维修师傅做的第一件事就是用一个罐子往油箱里倒了一些汽油。汽车立即发动了，我觉得自己像个十足的傻瓜。原来是我的燃油表有问题，卡在了「满」的位置上。

### 6.5 思路的错误

Mistaking the frame

If you make a textbook landing at the wrong airport or perfectly execute an unsuitable hairstyle, your error is not a failure of technique. It's a failure to perceive the bigger picture. Becoming expert means you have to combine knowledge and skill with an understanding of the whole context. You have to be vigilant for what is happening around the edges of your situation, not just at the centre.

By this stage, you're on the verge of becoming a Journeyman, of working independently. Error has different consequences and implications from when you were an Apprentice. Errors now may affect the work itself, your colleagues, or others such as patients or passengers. And for every full-blown error there will be lots of near misses. Some of these will be blameworthy, others not. But part of becoming expert is developing resilience, carrying on without either trivializing errors or allowing them to destroy you. As Samuel Beckett tersely put it: ‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.'

This requires self-awareness and insight. Back in the world of medicine, Renée Fox – in her 1957 book Training for Uncertainty – identifies three types of uncertainty. ‘The first results from incomplete or imperfect mastery of available knowledge,' she writes. ‘The second depends upon limitations in current medical knowledge … The third source of uncertainty derives from the first two. This consists of difficulty in distinguishing between personal ignorance or ineptitude and the limitations of present medical knowledge.' While Fox was focused on medicine, this holds true in all fields of expertise: it's hard to know what you don't know.

Often it's not because people don't know enough that they make errors, but because for some reason they do the wrong thing. No matter how many times someone tells you to save your project on the computer, sooner or later you don't bother and a day's work is lost. However often your boss warns you not to over-tighten a nut on an engine you're working on, one day you go too far and shear it off. This kind of error is how you develop an embodied understanding of the material world and what it feels like to interact with it. This is how you learn to recognize limits, to know when materials or people are on the verge of collapse. It's only by shearing off a nut that you stock your internal library with ‘tight' and ‘over-tight'. It's a horrible feeling, but it happens to us all.

It happened to me when I was building my harpsichord. By that time, it was over ten years since my debacle at Johannesburg Airport and I was back in the UK. After six months, the end was in sight. I'd finished the basic assembly, put the keyboard into position and shaped the hundreds of jacks for the strings. I was on to the ‘voicing', scraping and shaping the plectra to give the instrument its touch and tone.

The art of voicing is to shave each plectrum with a scalpel so that its volume and tone matches the other notes. Once you've learned to use the scalpel without slicing your thumb off, you work on each plectrum in turn. This is a challenge. Take off too little and the sound is harsh and aggressive. Take off too much and it becomes barely audible. A fraction further and the plectrum snaps. The process gets more difficult as you go on, because the heavier bass strings need firmer plectra than the lightweight treble ones. Voicing harpsichord plectra is working with thin materials on the verge of collapse. Like Duncan Hooson and his pottery vases, the line between too little and too much is very fine.

Finally, after months of work, my harpsichord was finished. Every note worked, the voicing sounded reasonable and I couldn't wait to play it. But first I had to get it out of the tiny bedroom where I'd built it, allowing my youngest daughter to return. When it was in a larger room, I discovered to my horror that I could hardly hear it. The sound was completely lost: I had shaved all the plectra too far. In what I later learned was a classic beginner's blunder, I had voiced it for the room where I was making it, not the room where it would be played. In the words of Fabrice and the hairstylists, when it's too short, it's too late. You can't put it back if you remove too much. All you can do is start again. I had to remove every one of those two hundred plectra and go through the whole painful process again. I was furious with myself.

Here were several problems. I'd never built a harpsichord before, so I had no idea of the stages which lay ahead of me or what it should sound like. I was building the instrument in isolation, away from anybody who could help, so I wasn't part of a community of practice. I was trying to interpret instructions written by somebody who was already expert and knew what the final outcome should be. Such instructions assume prior knowledge, which in my case I did not have. And because I'd never played a harpsichord, I didn't really know what mine should sound like or how it should feel. I had few coordinates when plotting my path through making that instrument, and no clear idea of where I was heading.

如果你在错误的机场完成了一次教科书般的降落，或者完美地剪出了一个不合适的发型，那么你的错误并不是技术上的失败，而是未能看清大局的失败。成为专家意味着你必须将知识和技能与对整体情境的理解结合起来。你必须对周边发生的事情保持清醒的认识，而不是仅仅关注问题的核心。

在这个阶段，你即将成为独立工作的熟练工。在做学徒的时候，你犯错的后果和影响与此时不同。现在的错误可能会影响工作本身、你的同事或他人，比如患者或乘客。你每犯一个严重的错误之前，都会经历许多次「未遂事故」。一些「未遂事故」是应受责备的，还有些则不是。但是，成为专家还需要你培养抗逆力，坚持前行，同时不要轻视错误，也不要让错误打垮你。萨缪尔·贝克特（Samuel Beckett）简洁明了地指出：「尝试过，失败过，都无妨。再尝试，再失败，纵使失败也是进步。」

这需要自我意识与洞察力。回到医学界，勒妮·福克斯 （Renée Fox）在她 1957 年出版的《不确定性训练》（Training forUncertainty）中提出了三种不确定性。「第一种不确定性源于对发现有知识的掌握不完全、不完美，」她写道，「第二种不确定性取决于当前医学知识的局限性…… 不确定性的第三种来源，是前两种不确定性的结果。这种不确定性包含了如何分辨个人的无知、无能与现有医学知识局限性的难题。」虽然福克斯讨论的重点是医学，但这个道理适用于所有专业领域：你很难知道自己不知道什么。

通常情况下，大家犯错并不是因为他们知道得不够多，而是因为他们出于某种原因做了错误的事情。不管别人多少次告诉你要在电脑上保存自己的工作项目，但迟早你会把这种忠告抛诸脑后，一天的劳动就此付诸东流。不管你的老板多少次警告你不要把引擎上的螺母拧得太紧，但总有一天你会用力过度，把螺母拧坏。你需要靠这种错误来发展对于物质世界的具身理解，并了解与之互动的感觉。你需要靠这种方式了解工作中的极限，知道何时工作对象或他人会濒临崩溃。只有通过拧坏螺母，你才能在内部感觉库中存储「紧」和「太紧」的感觉。这是一种可怕的感受，但我们人人都会体会到。

我在制作羽管键琴时就遇到过这样的事情。那时候，距我在约翰内斯堡机场犯错已有十多年之久了，我已经回到了英国。开始制作的六个月后，我似乎又面临了世界末日。我已经完成了基本的组装，装好了琴键，做好了几百个安装琴弦的顶杆。现在我要开始「定音」了，刮制弦拨，为羽管键琴赋予触感与音色。定音的诀窍在于用小刀削刮每根弦拨，使其音量与音色与其他琴键相匹配。一旦你学会了使用小刀而不把拇指切掉，你就能依次加工每个弦拨了。这是一项挑战。刮得太少，琴音就会尖锐刺耳。刮得太多，琴音就几乎听不到了。再多刮一点，弦拨就会断成两截。这个过程会变得越来越困难，因为比起较轻的高音弦，较重的低音弦需要的弦拨更结实。为羽管键琴的弦拨定音，就是在崩溃的边缘处理脆弱的工作对象。就像邓肯·胡森制作陶瓷花瓶一样，「太少」和「太多」之间的界限非经过几个月的努力，我的羽管键琴终于要完成了。每个琴常微妙。

键都能正常工作，听起来定音做得不错，我已经迫不及待地想要弹奏了。但首先我得把琴从制作它的小卧室里搬出来，把卧室还给小女儿。移到大一些的房间里时，我惊恐地发现，我几乎听不到羽管键琴的声音。声音似乎完全消失了：我把所有弦拨刮得太多了。后来我了解到，这是一个典型的初学者错误，我是为制作羽管键琴的房间给琴定的音，却没有为演奏它的房间定音。借用法布里斯和其他发型设计师的话来说，「刮得太短，为时已晚」。如果你刮掉的部分太多，就不能再拼回去了。

你只能重新开始。我必须将那 200 个弦拨一个一个地取下来，再经历一次这个痛苦的过程。我很生自己的气。

这里有几个问题。我以前从没制作过羽管键琴，所以我不知道我要经历哪些阶段，也不知道它应该发出什么样的声音。我是在孤立的环境里制作这台乐器的，没有任何可以帮助我的人，所以我不是实践社群中的一员。我在试着解读一个已经是专家的人写的说明书，他知道最终结果应该是什么样的。这样的说明书假定我有先前的相关知识，但我没有。因为我从没弹过羽管键琴，所以我并不真正知道我的琴应该发出什么声音，也不知道它弹起来应该有什么感觉。我在制作这台乐器时，并没有多少参照点，也不清楚我的目标。

### 6.6 集体错误与同谋

Collective error and collusion

My error in voicing the harpsichord was mine alone, caused by my inexperience and an inability to understand the bigger picture. But unlike mistakes in an individual's workshop, errors in surgery are seldom caused by one person alone. Sometimes they happen by default, by inaction or by a collective reluctance to intervene. Sometimes they are difficult to explain afterwards.

I experienced this at first hand during one of my hospital attachments – a cardiac surgery unit where the atmosphere was toxic. For some reason, the consultants seemed to be at war with one another. As a registrar (a surgeon in training), I felt the brunt of this hostility. After heart surgery, patients go to the intensive care unit (ICU) to recover. At any time, the ICU would contain patients for each of the consultants I worked for. One of my jobs was to make sure these patients were stable, and to adjust the intravenous drugs that supported their hearts after the operation. Every four hours there would be an ICU ward round. The consultant surgeons would take it in turns to lead the round and give instructions. Each countermanded the orders of the one before, for no good reason that I could see except to impose their authority. It was a horrible place to work.

Part of my job involved assisting at open heart operations, where patients with aortic or mitral valve disease would be put onto a cardiopulmonary bypass (heart–lung machine), so that their heart could be stopped, the faulty valve cut out and an artificial one put in. Although the operation was routine and generally safe, it was important to minimize how long the patient remained on bypass, as it could lead to brain damage and other complications.

Replacement valves at that time consisted of a silastic ball within a metal cage. As the heart contracts, the ball moves forward into the cage and allows the blood to flow. As the heart relaxes, the ball falls back and blocks the flow. The cage was surrounded by a fabric ring, which allowed the new valve to be securely sewn in with a watertight join.

One day, I was the second assistant in a valve replacement performed by a senior consultant. The first assistant was an experienced registrar who was specializing in cardiac surgery, and the rest of the team (scrub nurse, runners, pump technician and many others) had done this procedure countless times. I'd only ever seen a couple of valve replacements.

Once the patient was on bypass and the heart had been stopped, the consultant swiftly excised the diseased valve. Then he began the painstaking process of sewing in the new one. As usual, he started by inserting a circle of long sutures, each taking a firm bite through the residual rim of the diseased valve before passing through the fabric ring of the replacement. He would slide the new valve down these threads until it was snugly seated in the heart, then tie the sutures.

While this was happening, I got an uncomfortable feeling. I tried to visualize what this new valve would look like once it was in the heart, thinking which way the silastic ball would move in its cage. It didn't seem right and I couldn't imagine how the blood would flow through it in the proper direction. I almost wondered if I should say something, but it seemed unimaginable that this highly experienced surgeon could put in a valve the wrong way round. Anyway, surely the other (also highly experienced) members of the team would shout if there was a problem. So I said nothing. I carried on holding my retractor while the surgeon slid the valve into position and tied all the sutures. His first assistant cut each of the excess threads, leaving a tiny knot.

Suddenly the surgeon realized what had happened. All the usual theatre noises stopped and there was a profound silence. First, very quietly, he said, ‘Fuck.' Then: ‘Sister, I'll need to remove the valve and put it in again.' Everyone knew how serious this was, as the additional time would take the patient into the danger zone for being on bypass. Nobody said a word as he cut all the stitches, removed the valve and went through the whole process a second time. Afterwards, I never heard anybody allude to it. It was as if it had never happened. Luckily, the patient was fine, but it was a mistake which could have had devastating consequences.

Thinking back over that experience, I can understand it from the surgeon's perspective. One cause of error is the narrowing of attention that comes with stressful, high-stakes work. Experts depend on the ability to focus on what they are doing and push away distractions. By zooming in on the work at hand, they give it their undivided attention. But this risks over-focusing on one part of the picture, blunting their awareness of what's happening all around. It is easy to imagine becoming so absorbed in a task like putting in a heart valve that wider questions about whether it's the right way round might become lost. You could become preoccupied by the challenges of sewing brittle tissue, adjusting suture tension to ensure a leak-proof fit, and completing the task with swift efficiency. As I learned the hard way in Johannesburg in my little Cessna, and again when voicing my harpsichord back in the UK, it's all too easy to lose sight of the big picture when you're struggling with the details.

The bigger question is about that surgical team. To this day I cannot understand why nobody said anything. Many people must have known – the first assistant certainly, the scrub nurse too, and most likely others in the room. Probably, it was a combination of an unwillingness to challenge authority, a fear of ridicule by talking out of turn, and a potentially lethal dash of Schadenfreude within a workplace that was based on competition between ambitious professionals rather than collaboration for the benefit of patients. Even I'd had an inkling but was too afraid to speak up. At that stage I was a peripheral participant in a community of practice whose ways I hadn't become familiar with, and I allowed myself to collude in a shared silence.

Patient safety is a major issue worldwide. Medicine and surgery have learned a lot from aviation, especially in terms of authority within the cockpit. This problem of collusive silence is well known in hierarchical systems. Responding to a series of catastrophic accidents over many years, often caused by communication failure, aviation has empowered everyone to have a voice and to feel comfortable in stating the obvious. Current airline practice expects every member of the team to speak out if they notice anything amiss – and they do. I often thought about my experience with the heart valve in the years that followed, as evidence mounted that medical errors are seldom the fault of one person. I kept wondering why I hadn't spoken up.

The enormous body of literature on error shows that few disasters are caused by individual incompetence, inattention or sheer bad luck. But case after case also demonstrates how individuals are blamed for wider issues within organizations and systems. This continues to happen with medical errors, and high-profile examples such as the paediatrician Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, under whose care a child died, have exposed fault lines in the way that medical and other professions deal with harm. Experts such as James Reason, Don Berwick, Charles Vincent and Atul Gawande have explored the assumptions we make, the actions we take and the difficulties we have in acknowledging and learning from error. Their insights fit with research from safety-critical industries such as aviation, offshore oil drilling and nuclear power.

James Reason is well known for his ‘Swiss cheese' model of error. He has pointed out that weaknesses in a system are like holes in a slice of Emmental. If several slices line up, they allow an error to pass through and cause disaster. That's what happened when I landed unannounced in KSL at Johannesburg airport: I flew along the lined-up holes in the Swiss cheese. I was inexperienced, the control tower team were inattentive, the system's level of alertness was low. By good fortune, there wasn't an airliner coming through those same holes in the cheese towards me. But it was a close shave. I hope that the control tower team learned as much as I did.

浅花我在给羽管键琴定音时的错误是我自己一个人的责任，因为我缺乏经验，无法从全局来考虑问题。但是，与个人工坊里的错误不同，手术中的错误很少是由一个人造成的。有时这些错误是由于默认、不作为的态度或大家不愿意干预而造成的。这些错误有时在事后很难解释。

我在医院实习时对这一点有过亲身的体会。当时我所在的心外科的氛围很糟糕。由于某种原因，顾问医师似乎在相互争斗。作为一名住院医生（正在受训的外科医生），我能感受到这种敌意的冲击。在心脏手术后，患者会被送入重症监护室休养。不论何时，我的每位顾问医师都有患者在重症监护室里。我的任务之一，就是确保这些患者病情稳定，并调整在术后支持他们心脏的静脉药物。每隔四小时就会有一次查房。外科顾问医师会轮流带领我们查房，做出指示。每位顾问医师都会撤销上一位医师发出的指令，除了强调自己的权威，我看不出他们这样做有什么理由。那是个可怕的工作环境。

我的部分工作任务是协助心内直视手术。在手术中，医生会给患有主动脉瓣或二尖瓣疾病的患者接上体外循环机（人工心肺机），这样患者的心脏就可以停止跳动，医生就可以切除有缺陷的瓣膜，植入人工瓣膜。虽然这种手术很常规，而且一般来说是安全的，但重要的是要尽量减少患者停留在体外循环机上的时间，因为这可能会导致脑损伤和其他并发症。

当时的替换瓣膜是一个装在金属笼架内的硅橡胶球。当心脏收缩时，硅橡胶球会向前移动，让血液流通。心脏舒张时，球会回到原来的位置，阻断血流。笼架周围有一个缝环，缝环使得新瓣膜能够牢固地缝合，缝合处不会渗出液体。

有一天，我担任由一位资深顾问医师主刀的瓣膜置换手术的第二助手。第一助手是一位经验丰富的心外科住院医生，团队的其他成员（洗手护士、巡回护士、血泵技术员以及许多其他人）都做过无数次这样的手术了。我只观摩过几次瓣膜置换患者一接上体外循环机，心脏一停止跳动，顾问医师就迅手术。

速切除了病变的瓣膜。然后，他就开始了缝合新瓣膜的艰苦过程。与往常一样，他开始了缝合。要缝上长长的一圈，每一针都要结结实实地穿过病变瓣膜残留的边缘，然后再穿过替换瓣膜的缝环。他让新瓣膜顺着这些缝合线滑落下去，直到瓣膜牢牢地固定在心脏上，然后打结。

在这个过程中，我产生了一种不舒服的感觉。我试着想象这个新瓣膜在心脏里是什么样子，硅橡胶球会在笼架里如何移动。似乎有些不对劲，我无法想象血液如何沿着正确的方向流过瓣膜。我有些犹豫自己是否应该说些什么，但似乎更难想象的是，这个经验丰富的外科医生会把瓣膜的方向装反。不管怎样，如果真的出了错，团队里的其他成员（经验也都非常丰富）肯定会喊出声来的。于是我什么都没说。我继续握着牵开器，外科医生将瓣膜放到合适的位置，然后给所有的缝合线打结。

他的第一助手把多余的线头剪掉，留下小结。突然主刀的外科医生意识到发生了什么。手术室里平常的噪声突然都不见了，只有一片寂静。他先是小声地骂了一句，

然后他说：「护士，我得把瓣膜取出来再放进去。」每个人都知道这有多严重，因为患者在体外循环机上，更长的时间会带来危险。他剪开所有缝合线，取出瓣膜，又做了一遍整个过程。没有人说一句话。此后，我没有听任何人提起过这件事。就好像这件事从没有发生过一样。幸运的是，患者没事，但这是一个可能会导致灾难性后果的错误。

站在外科医生的角度，回想起那段经历，我可以表示理解。犯错的一个原因是压力大、风险高的工作会使人的注意力范围变得狭窄。专家很依赖专注于手头工作、排除干扰的能力。通过专注于手头的工作，他们全身心地投入其中。但是，这可能会让他们过度关注事情的某一部分，使他们意识不到事情的所有其他方面。我们很容易想象，如果你全神贯注于一项任务，比如放置心脏瓣膜，那你就可能忽视更宏观的问题，比如放置的方向是否正确。你可能会全神贯注于缝合脆弱的组织、调整缝合的松紧以保证密封性、快速高效地完成任务等多项挑战。在约翰内斯堡的塞斯纳小飞机上，以及在英国给羽管键琴定音时，我学到了这一惨痛的教训：如果你纠结于细节，就很容易忽视大局。

问题更大的是那个手术团队。至今我仍然不明白，为什么没有人指出错误。很多人肯定知道 —— 第一助手肯定知道，洗手护士也知道，房间里的其他人很可能都知道。或许，这是因为大家不愿挑战权威、害怕因为说错话而遭人嘲笑，以及一种可能置人于死地的幸灾乐祸 —— 在这种工作场所里，雄心勃勃的专业人士只顾互相竞争，而不肯为了患者的利益相互合作。就连我也隐约察觉出了问题，但不敢说出来。在当时，我是实践社群的边缘人，我不熟悉他们的做事方式，我任由自己成为患者安全是一个世界范围内的大问题。内科和外科已经从这种共同沉默的同谋。

航空领域学到了许多东西，尤其是在驾驶舱内的权威方面。这种共谋的沉默在等级森严的系统中是众所周知的。多年来，由于经历了一系列灾难性事故（往往是由沟通不畅造成的），航空公司让每个人都拥有了发言权，能够自由地指出显而易见的问题。航空公司目前的做法是，一旦发现问题，团队中的每一个成员都要直言不讳 —— 他们也的确做到了这一点。在后来的许多年里，我经常想起那次心脏瓣膜置换手术的经历，因为越来越多的证据表明，医疗事故很少是一个人的过错。我一直在想我为什么没有说出来。

大量关于「错误」的文献表明，严重的错误很少是由个人的无能、疏忽或坏运气造成的；但一个接一个的案例也表明，个体会因为组织和系统内更广泛的问题而遭受指责。在医疗事故中，这种情况仍在不断发生。像儿科医生哈迪扎·巴瓦－加尔巴（Hadiza Bawa-Garba）这样著名的案例（一名儿童在其护理下死亡）暴露了医疗和其他行业处理伤害事故方面的隐忧。

詹姆斯·里森（James Reason）、唐·贝里克（Don Berwick）、查尔斯·文森特（Charles Vincent）与阿图尔·加万德（Atul Gawande）等专家研究了人们做出的假设、采取的行动，以及在承认错误、从错误中学习时遇到的困难。他们的见解与航空、海上石油钻探、核能等高度注重行业安全的领域的研究一致。

詹姆斯·里森以他的「瑞士奶酪」错误模型而闻名。他指出，系统中的弱点就像多孔奶酪片上的孔一样。如果几片奶酪连在一起，它们的孔就会允许错误畅通无阻，造成灾难。这就是我驾驶 KSL 在约翰内斯堡机场意外降落时发生的事情：我沿着瑞士奶酪上的一排孔飞了过去。我缺乏经验，而控制塔团队也不专心，机场管制系统的警惕性也很低。幸运的是，没有别的飞机沿着奶酪上相同的孔朝我飞来。这只是侥幸。我希望控制塔团队能像我一样学到很多东西。

### 6.7 专家与错误

Experts and error

So what is the relationship between error and learning? Error can have a devastating effect on you and your work, even if nobody gets killed or injured. When you make a mistake, it's easy to believe that you have failed as a person and allow it to shatter your self-belief. Somehow you have to distinguish between the consequences of error for your work and its impact upon you. How you navigate this determines whether you frame error as a constructive process, by which you mature and progress, or a destructive one which demolishes your confidence. Musicians and managing directors alike will talk about preparation, performance and recovery as resilience: the ability to survive when things go wrong and to make something positive of the experience. Yet despite its power to teach us, error in many settings remains a dirty word.

Sometimes mistakes happen through ignorance, inattention or hubris. If that's the case, you need to acknowledge those unappealing aspects of yourself and head off repetitions. (I certainly never landed a plane at the wrong airport again.) At other times, error is just a painful part of becoming expert. Of course, the consequences of error depend on your field of expertise. There is an old truism that nobody dies if you play a wrong note on the concert platform, whereas if you're performing a surgical operation or flying an aeroplane, error can literally be fatal. That's true when you focus on those who experience the error – the audience, patients or passengers. But the effect of error can be devastating for those making it too. If playing a wrong note early in a pianist's career leads to debilitating stage fright, they can get stuck in their path to becoming expert. It is only if you can learn from error and build up resilience that you can progress to the later stages.

Back in the Bara operating theatre with Jonas, I wait for my heart to stop pounding. I have to put aside the nightmare of what could have happened if I'd snipped that grey squidgy structure that turned out to be his internal jugular vein. I'd been working with too much speed and I'd made assumptions. Fighting down a sense of panic, I force myself to be systematic, to take things slowly and examine every structure I encounter. Gradually, the knowledge from textbooks and the dissecting room reasserts itself and I start to make sense of the landscape of Jonas's injured neck, and all those little buggers I'd spent so long memorizing. I recognize some familiar structures and get back on track. I realize that the operation may be difficult but it's not beyond the boundaries of my skill. I may be butting up against my limits, but as long as I'm strict with myself and maintain focus, I can do it.

Eventually I find where the blood is coming from. I control the bleeding with vascular clamps and close the hole with tiny stitches. I take the clamps off and breathe a sigh of relief when the operative field stays dry. Finally, I'm able to close the wound and send Jonas to the recovery bay. Every time I see Jonas on the ward after that, I think what a narrow escape we both had. I'm relieved he's getting better but I have a queasy feeling that my inexperience put me a hair's breadth from making a bad situation infinitely worse. But that comes with the territory of flying solo.

So, error is something that happens to us all. But there is a distinction between the errors we make through inexperience, the ones we make through sloppiness or inattention, and those ‘honourable errors' that come from trying things out and finding they don't work. If you are going to improve, you have to venture out from the safety of the workshop or studio into the real world, and that involves getting things wrong. Now the errors you make have consequences, both for you and for other people. Part of becoming expert is developing resilience, finding ways of coping that neither minimize the impact of your actions nor damage your confidence beyond repair.

You are now poised at the threshold between the sheltered world of the Apprentice and the harsher milieu of the independent practitioner, the Journeyman. We've already seen some of the bad things that can happen, the near misses and narrow squeaks. The next chapters explore the internal shifts that have to take place as you push yourself out there and develop the individuality that defines the expert you are going to become. At the time it seems like magic. And, in a sense, it is.

那么，错误与学习之间有什么关系？即使没有人员伤亡，错误也可能对你和你的工作产生毁灭性的影响。在犯错时，你很容易相信自己是个失败的人，允许错误击碎你的自我信念。你必须设法区分错误对工作造成的后果，以及它对你产生的影响。如何处理这一问题，将决定你是把错误看作使你成熟和进步的建设性过程，还是摧毁你信心的破坏性过程。无论是音乐家还是总经理，他们都会谈论准备、表现与恢复（抗逆力）：在出错后坚持下来，并从这种经历中取得积极结果的能力。然而，尽管错误能给我们经验教训，但在许多情况下，它依然是一个令人讨厌的词。

有时错误的发生是因为无知、疏忽或傲慢。如果是这样的话，你需要承认自己那些不够好的方面，以免重蹈覆辙（我再也没有把飞机降落在错误的机场了）。还有些时候，错误只是成为专家的痛苦部分。当然，错误的后果取决于你的专业领域。有一句老话说得很好，如果你在音乐会的舞台上弹错了音，没有人会死，但如果你在做手术或开飞机时犯了错，就可能要人命。

想想那些受错误影响的人，如观众、患者或乘客，这句话说得没错。但是对于那些犯错的人来说，错误的影响可能同样是毁灭性的。如果钢琴家在职业生涯早期弹错音符而导致怯场，这种错误就可能阻碍他们成为专家。只有从错误中吸取经验教训，培养抗逆力，你才能进入更高级的阶段。

回到在巴拉瓜纳医院给乔纳斯做手术的时候。我在等待心跳恢复平静。如果我剪断了那条滑腻的灰色组织 —— 他的颈内静脉，那会发生什么？我必须把这个可怕的想法放在一边。我的动作太快了，我做了一些假设。我强压内心的恐慌，迫使自己放慢速度，有条不紊地检查我看到的每一个组织。渐渐地，从教科书与解剖室里得来的知识显得越来越有道理了，我开始看清乔纳斯受伤的脖子里的组织结构了，也看到了所有那些我花了很长时间才记下来的小东西。我认出了一些熟悉的组织，回到了正轨上。我知道手术可能很难，但没有超出我的能力范围。我可能要使出浑身解数，但只要我严格要求自己，保持专注，我就能做到。

最后我找到了出血的位置。我用血管钳控制住出血，用细线缝合伤口。当手术区不再被血液浸湿的时候，我取下血管钳，松了一口气。终于，我缝合了伤口，把乔纳斯送去康复病房。

从那以后，每次我在病房里看见乔纳斯，都会想起我们俩死里逃生的经历。他的病情正在好转，我松了一口气，但我有一种不舒服的感觉；因为我缺乏经验，差一点就让糟糕的情况变得不可挽回。但是，这就是独当一面必然会遇到的事情。

我们每个人都会犯错。但是，我们因缺乏经验、马虎或疏忽而犯的错误，与那些因为尝试而失败的「可敬错误」是有区别的。如果你想进步，就必须冒险离开工坊或工作室里的安全地带，进入现实世界，这就必然会导致犯错。你在这时犯的错误会对你和其他人产生影响。成为专家的一部分，就是培养抗逆力，你要想办法既不为自己行为的影响开脱，又不让自己的信心受到无法挽回的打击。

你现在处在学徒受保护的环境与独立工作者（熟练工）的严苛环境之间的门槛上。我们已经看到，有些糟糕的事情可能会发生，也可能会有未遂事故与险情。在接下来的章节里，我们将探索你必须做出的内在转变。你要鞭策自己走上世界的舞台，发展个性。这种个性定义了你将要成为的专家。在那时，这一切就像变魔术一样。从某种意义上讲，的确如此。
