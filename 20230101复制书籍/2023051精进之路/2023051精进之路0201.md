## 0201. 外科医生与裁缝

0201 The surgeon and the tailor

It's 1981. I'm in Emergency Theatre B at Baragwanath Hospital and I'm about to start a trauma case. Baragwanath is in Soweto in South Africa – at that time one of the most violent places in the world. It's 4 a.m. on a Saturday night and Simon, a young Zulu man in his early twenties, has been stabbed. He's on a stretcher when I first meet him, coils of intestine spilling out of a wound in his abdomen onto the sheet that covers him. Night after night, patients like Simon are rushed into the ‘surgical pit' for emergency treatment.

I've only been at Baragwanath for a short time, but already I'm used to seeing patients with their guts hanging out – evisceration, as the textbooks call it. I've learned that the dramatic-looking ones aren't always the most dangerous. But Simon fn1 is really sick. He's not responding, he's slipping into unconsciousness and his blood pressure is dropping. He must be bleeding internally, and he needs immediate surgery.

We've rushed him to theatre. It's a busy intake, with several surgeons on duty. They are all in other theatres, dealing with their own cases. I'm in my twenties, eager to operate but still wet behind the ears. I've been a surgical registrar at Baragwanath for a year or so, and I've reached the stage where I should be able to do an operation like this on my own.

With elective (planned) surgery, you can start with ‘easy' cases and build up. But with trauma surgery, you never know what you're going to find. Blades and bullets don't respect anatomy, and what starts off as a straightforward case can quickly turn into a nightmare. As I scrub up, I go through in my mind what I might encounter. I'm excited and terrified at the same time.

As soon as Simon is anaesthetized, I clean his skin, cover him with sterile drapes, then make an incision in his abdominal wall. I deepen it until I'm into the peritoneal cavity. Dark blood wells up and I can't see a thing. Lumps of maize floating on the blood and a sudden sour whiff of beer show there's contamination – the stab wound has gone into the stomach, at least. But my first priority is to stop the bleeding.

There's so much blood that at first I can't find where it's coming from. The temptation is to grab the first bleeding point I can see, but I force myself to slow down and be systematic, examining each of the organs in turn before deciding what to deal with first. Liver, stomach, small bowel, large bowel, spleen, pelvic organs. One by one I check them, sometimes by eye, sometimes reaching around corners to feel the parts I can't see.

I realize with a lurch that the stab wound is deeper than I thought. It's gone down towards the head of the pancreas – tiger country for any surgeon, but especially one as inexperienced as I am. Blood keeps obliterating my field of view and I feel a rising panic. What if I can't cope, and my patient bleeds out on the table?

1981 年，我在巴拉瓜纳医院的 B 紧急手术室，准备开始为一个外伤患者做手术。巴拉瓜纳医院位于南非的索韦托 —— 当时这里是世界上暴力最为泛滥的地区之一。周六凌晨四点，20 岁出头的祖鲁族青年西蒙被刺伤了。我刚见到他时，他正躺在转运床上，一节肠子从他腹部的伤口中流了出来，摊在他身上的床单上。夜复一夜，常有像西蒙这样的患者被推进手术室（我们称之为「手术坑」）进行紧急治疗。

我来巴拉瓜纳医院的时间不长，但我已经习惯了看到患者的肠子挂在外面 —— 就像教科书里讲的除脏术一样。我知道那些看起来很夸张的病例并不是最危险的，但西蒙的病情很危急。他没有任何反应，正逐渐失去意识，血压也在下降。他肯定是内出血了，需要马上动手术。

我们急忙把他送去手术室。我们接诊的人手不足，只有几名外科医生值班。他们都在其他手术室里，处理他们自己的患者。我只有 20 多岁，渴望亲手动手术，但还很稚嫩。我在巴拉瓜纳医院做了一年左右的外科住院医师，现在我已经可以独立做这样的手术了。

在有选择（计划）的情况下，你可以从「简单」的手术做起，逐步积累经验。但对于外伤手术患者，你永远无法知道自己会面对什么。尖刀和子弹不理会解剖学上的难易，一开始看起来简单的病例，可能很快就会变得像噩梦一样棘手。我把手洗干净，在脑子里想象着可能会遇到的情况。我既兴奋又害怕。

西蒙一进入麻醉状态，我就给他的皮肤消了毒，盖上无菌洞巾，然后在他的腹壁上切开一个口子。我继续往里切，直到切开腹膜腔。暗红的血涌了出来，我什么也看不见。一块块玉米残渣漂浮在血液里，突然出现的酸啤酒味表明腹腔受到了污染 —— 至少伤到了胃。但是我的首要任务是止血。

血太多了，一开始我都不知道血是从哪儿来的。此时我很容易只顾自己能看到的第一个出血点，但我强迫自己放慢速度、着眼全局，依次检查每个器官，然后决定先做什么。肝脏、胃、小肠、大肠、脾、盆腔器官。我一个接一个地检查，有时用眼睛看，有时用手摸索，去感觉我看不到的部分。

我猛然意识到刺伤比我想象的更深。伤口向下延伸到了胰腺的上部 —— 对任何外科医生来说都很棘手，对我这样经验不足的人来说就更难了。血液不断地阻碍我的视线，我感到越来越恐慌。万一我无力应付，患者在手术台上失血而死怎么办？ 

### 2.1 成为外科医生

Becoming a surgeon

That night in the operating theatre with Simon I was certainly no expert, though I'd done a fair amount of surgery under supervision. I had started to do things on my own, to take responsibility for the decisions I made, but I hadn't had much experience in leading major operations. In terms of the path I outlined in the previous chapter, I was well into the Apprentice phase, and starting to become a Journeyman.

Fast-forward almost four decades. My career since then has taken me in unexpected directions. I'm not a trauma surgeon now. I'm not even seeing patients. Instead I've become a professor at a large London university, and I've specialized in surgical education. I spend a lot of my time exploring what it is to become an expert, and now I'm writing this book. It's a long way from where I began, and now I'll explain how I got here.

When I was starting that operation on Simon in Soweto in 1981, I'd been studying medicine for over ten years and was well into my training as a surgeon. The first six of those years were at medical school. Then my career kicked off in earnest. First came a year as a newly qualified house officer. Next I went back to the university where I'd qualified, and spent a year teaching anatomy to medical students. That was because I'd decided I wanted to become a surgeon, and I needed to pass the Primary Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, a fearsome exam on anatomy, physiology and pathology. This was a stage on the way to gaining the Final Fellowship (FRCS for short), which was essential for becoming a consultant in the distant future. My anatomical knowledge as a medical student had been shaky to say the least, and I realized that the best way to learn was to teach.

After my time demonstrating anatomy, I'd been a junior doctor in orthopaedics, Accident and Emergency, and obstetrics. Then an opportunity came up to spend a year in South Africa. I leapt at the chance. Soon I found myself in alien and fascinating surroundings on the other side of the world. It proved so interesting that one year turned into two, then five. I completed my training as a specialist surgeon and became a consultant in South Africa.

For much of that time I worked at Baragwanath Hospital (now Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital), or ‘Bara' for short. Bara is in Soweto – South West Township, to give it its full name – on the outskirts of Johannesburg. At that time Soweto had a population of well over a million people. Bara was its only major hospital, and was one of the busiest in the world. This was towards the end of the apartheid era, and all the patients I looked after were black. They came from a bewildering array of cultures and spoke many languages. I'd never experienced anything like it.

Although we had patients with every kind of surgical condition, a lot of the time I was treating young men who had been stabbed or shot. Weekends were especially busy, as the migrant workers in Johannesburg would get drunk on payday and attack one another with pangas (machetes) or sometimes guns. It was gruelling, and I often worked for thirty-six hours at a stretch with no sleep. Of course, it wasn't all wounds caused by violence. Many of our older patients had horrible diseases like cancer of the oesophagus (gullet), which was especially prevalent in that part of Africa. We had our fair share of patients with perforated ulcers and strangulated hernias, conditions I was used to from the UK. I also encountered diseases I'd read about but never seen, like typhoid. A lot of the work was repetitive and routine. I spent hours in the ‘septic theatre', draining the abscesses that were so common in our patients. But it was the trauma surgery I felt most attuned to.

Bara at weekends looked like a war zone, something I would experience for real a few years later. In Bara, as soon as the patients arrived they would be sorted by a process of triage. The most seriously injured were usually unconscious. Often nobody knew the patient's name, and they were recorded as something like ‘Unknown Saturday Number x' until a friend or relative arrived to identify them. They would be put onto a trolley with a red ‘URGENT' sticker on their forehead, covered with a grey blanket and wheeled into the aptly named surgical pit, where doctors and nurses would stabilize them. The surgical team on call would make an assessment, do an initial resuscitation and take any patient with life-threatening injuries straight to theatre for surgery. Simon was one of those.

In the operating theatre, Simon is bleeding profusely. I'm starting to panic. Fortunately, Sister Ramaphosa, my scrub nurse, is highly experienced. Just as well, as my first assistant this evening is a newly qualified doctor who doesn't like surgery. He usually stays out of theatre, where he's not much use. But at least he can hold a retractor, helping me to get a clear view inside Simon's abdominal cavity.

At last, my systematic exploration pays off and I find a severed artery pumping in the small bowel mesentery, a delicate stalk that supplies the small intestine with blood. Before I have time to think, Sister Ramaphosa has put a pair of artery forceps in my hand. I clamp the vessel, wait a moment, then breathe more easily as things start to come under control. Nobody has said a word.

It gives me time to explore more thoroughly. These stab wounds are treacherous, as you've no idea how long the blade was or where it went. Sometimes a small blood clot is the only clue to serious damage deep inside; that's why I have to be systematic. I mobilize the colon; it looks a bit suspicious, so I need to check behind it. I snip the filmy layer which tethers it to Simon's posterior abdominal wall, gently separating the anatomical layers. When I approach the duodenum and pancreas, I'm really scared. Repairing an injury here would take me way beyond my comfort zone. I look carefully, exploring millimetre by millimetre. Although there's bruising, none of the vital structures have been seriously damaged. It's a huge relief.

The next hour is filled with cutting and stitching: removing a section of small intestine, sewing the ends together again, closing the wound in the stomach. All things I'd read about in textbooks and seen a hundred times before but seldom done on my own. After a final check, I'm satisfied that I've repaired all the damage. I close Simon's abdomen with sutures, put on a dressing and take off the green drapes, now soaked with blood. My gown, too, is soaked, and I have to go and change before I can start the next operation.

Opening someone's abdominal cavity to see what's wrong inside is called a laparotomy. I'd learned the steps from my textbooks. But books don't tell you what it feels like to operate, or how to cope when you realize you're getting out of your depth. The people who write the books have experienced that, but when you're starting out, you haven't. You don't yet share a language with them. Even the sensation of cutting into a living human body is hard to describe. The slitheriness of living flesh, the feel of organs pulsating under your fingers, the click of the instruments as they lock into place – not to mention the hammering of your heart as you start a major operation, or the sick feeling in your stomach when things start to go wrong. Nothing you read in books or see on television can prepare you for the real thing.

And none of those textbooks ever described the physical pleasure of operating when it goes well or the fear when things go wrong. None of them mentioned the satisfaction of seeing a seriously ill patient that you've operated on walking out of hospital once they've recovered. Looking back, I can still feel that mixture of excitement and apprehension when I opened Simon's abdomen. I didn't know what I'd find. I didn't know whether I could cope. But once I'd started, I forgot my anxiety. It wasn't about me any longer; it was about Simon. I had to work out what his injuries were and do my best to fix them. I narrowed my focus and concentrated on each part of the procedure, as I'd been taught. Luckily things turned out well, but afterwards I'd replay it in my head, wondering if I could have done things better.

After that operation I realized I'd reached a watershed. I wasn't an expert by any means – far from it. I was still in the Apprentice phase. But I had managed to subdue my anxiety and perform a difficult operation that ended well. For the first time, I felt I was becoming a surgeon , rather than just somebody who was able to do a surgical procedure.

Later I discovered that this happens to experts in many fields. Of course, when I was starting that operation I wasn't thinking of those other fields. I was a trainee surgeon, applying my scientific knowledge and physical skills to make an injured person better. It never occurred to me that I could learn from tailors, musicians, hairstylists or fighter pilots. Now, decades later, I wish I had.

和西蒙一起在手术室里的那天晚上，我当然不是什么专家，尽管我在督导之下做过不少手术。我已经开始独立做事，为自己的决定负责，但我没有太多主刀重大手术的经验。用我在前一章里概述的学艺之路来说，我早已进入了学徒阶段，开始成为一名熟练工。

来到大约 40 年后。与那时相比，我的职业生涯走向了意想不到的方向。我现在不是创伤外科医生了，甚至都不见患者。

相反，我成了伦敦一所大型高校的教授，专攻外科教育。我花了很多时间探索人如何成为专家，而现在我正在写作本书。这份工作与我的起点相去甚远，现在我会解释我是如何一路走到这里的。

在 1981 年的索韦托，当我开始为西蒙做手术时，我已经学医十余年了，接受了很长时间的外科医生训练。前六年的训练是在医学院进行的。然后我的职业生涯正式开始了。我取得医师资格后，先做了一年实习医生。然后我回到了我的母校，花了一年时间给医学生讲授解剖学。这是因为我决定做一名外科医生，需要通过皇家外科学院初级院士的考试，这是一系列令人生畏的解剖学、生理学和病理学考试。这是获得终极院士资格的必经之路，对于将来成为一名顾问医师至关重要。在求学时期，我的解剖学知识可以说不太扎实，我意识到学习的最好方式就是教学。

在教授解剖学以后，我又在骨科、事故与急诊科和产科担任过实习医生。然后，有一个在南非待上一年的机会出现了。

我抓住了这个机会。不久，我就来到了世界的另一头，置身于陌生而迷人的环境里。这次经历非常有趣，于是一年变成了两年、然后变成了五年。我完成了外科专科医生的培训，在南非成为一名顾问医师。

大部分时间我都在巴拉瓜纳医院（即现在的克里斯·哈尼·巴拉瓜纳医院，或简称「巴拉」医院）工作。巴拉瓜纳医院位于约翰内斯堡郊区的索韦托（Soweto）—— 其全称是西南镇（South West Township）。当时索韦托的人口有一百多万。巴拉瓜纳医院是当地唯一的一家大医院，也是世界上最繁忙的医院之一。当时正值种族隔离时代的末期，我看的所有患者都是黑人。他们来自五花八门的文化背景，说着许多不同的语言。我从来没有过这样的经历。

虽然我们给患者做过各式各样的手术，但很多时候我治疗的都是遭到刺伤或枪击的年轻男子。周末特别忙碌，因为约翰内斯堡的移民工人会在发薪日喝得酩酊大醉，用大砍刀（有时也会用枪）相互攻击。那种工作让人筋疲力尽，我经常连续工作 36 个小时不睡觉。当然，我们治疗的也不全是暴力造成的伤口。我们有许多老年患者患有可怕的疾病，比如食道癌。这种疾病在非洲的那个地区尤其普遍。我们有相当多的患者患有溃疡穿孔和绞窄疝，我在英国时就经常见到这些疾病。我也遇到过我读过但未见过的疾病，比如伤寒。许多工作都是重复和例行的。我也会一连好多个小时待在「脓肿治疗室」内，给患者身上常见的脓肿引流。但我最熟悉的还是创伤外科手术。

在周末，巴拉瓜纳医院看起来就像战场 —— 几年后我才会见识真正的战场。在巴拉瓜纳医院，患者一到就会按照分诊程序进行分类。伤势最严重的患者通常都失去了知觉。经常没有人知道患者的名字。直到朋友或亲属来确认他们的身份之前，

他们在病历上会被登记为「星期六第 × 号无名氏」。我们会把他们放在推车床上，在额头上贴上红色的「紧急」标签，盖上一条灰色的毯子，再推进名副其实的「手术坑」里，那里的医生和护士会让他们的状况稳定下来。待命的外科手术团队会进行评估，做初始复苏，并将危及生命的伤者直接送入手术室做手术。西蒙就是一名这样的患者。

在手术室里，西蒙流血不止。我开始感到恐慌。幸运的是，我的洗手护士拉马福萨经验非常丰富。我今晚的第一助手是一名刚取得医师资格的医生，他不喜欢手术。他通常不去手术室，因为他在那里帮不上什么忙。幸好他至少能拿稳牵开器，让我能清楚地看到西蒙的腹腔。

最后，我全面的检查取得了成效，我在小肠系膜里发现了一条被切断的动脉在搏动，这条纤细血管的作用是为小肠提供血液。我还没来得及思考，拉马福萨护士就将一把动脉钳放在我手里了。我夹住血管，过了一会儿，事情开始进入掌控之中，我的呼吸变得更轻松了。没有人说过一句话。

这样我就有时间更仔细地检查了。这种刺伤很棘手，因为你不知道刀有多长，也不知道刀是朝哪个方向刺的。有时一个小血块是体内严重损伤的唯一线索，这就是为什么我必须做全面检查。我动了动结肠，它看上去有点可疑，所以我要检查它的后方。我剪开把结肠固定在西蒙后腹腔壁上的薄膜，轻轻地将解剖层分开。当我的手靠近十二指肠和胰腺时，我感到非常害怕。修复这里的伤口远远不是我能从容做到的。我仔细地观第 2 章外科医生与裁缝 029 察，一厘米一厘米地摸索。虽然有些淤伤，但没有任何重要结构受到严重损害。我如释重负。

接下来是一个小时的切割与缝合：切除一段小肠，将两端重新缝上，缝合胃的伤口。这些事都是我在教科书中读过、看别人做过上百次的，但很少自己动手做。经过最后的检查，我很满意地看到我已经修复了所有的损伤。我用缝合线缝合了西蒙的腹部，包上敷料，取下沾满血迹的绿色洞巾。我的手术服也湿透了，我得先去换衣服才能开始下一场手术。

打开一个人的腹腔，观察内部状况的手术叫剖腹术。我在课本上学过这些步骤，但书本不会告诉你做手术是什么感觉，也不会告诉你当你意识到自己能力不够时该如何应对。写教材的人有那种经历，但当你开始学习时，你却没有。你和他们讲的还不是同一种语言。即便是切开一个活人身体的感觉也很难描述。鲜活肉体的滑腻感、器官在手指下搏动的感觉、器具锁定到正确位置时发出的咔嗒声 —— 更不用提你在做大手术时心脏的怦怦声，或者出错时胃里的恶心感。你在书中读到、在电视上看到的任何东西，都不能让你为真正的手术做好准备。

也没有任何一本教科书描述过手术顺利进行时的生理愉悦，或手术出问题时的恐惧。没有书籍提到过当你看见危重患者经过你的手术，康复出院时的满足感。现在回想起来，我仍然能感受到切开西蒙腹部时的那种既兴奋又恐惧的感觉。我不知道我会发现什么。我不知道我能否应付得来。可一旦我开始手术，我就忘记了焦虑。这件事不再是关于我的了，而是关于西蒙的。我必须弄清他的伤势，尽我所能来修补。就像老师教的那样，我精神高度集中，专注于手术的每一步。幸运的是，结果一切顺利，但我事后会反复回想，想知道我能否做得更好。

那次手术之后，我意识到自己来到了一个转折点。我那时根本不是专家 —— 还差得远。我还在学徒阶段。但是，我成功地克服了我的焦虑，做了一台困难的手术，结果很好。我第一次觉得自己成了一名外科医生，而不仅仅是一个会做外科手术的人。

后来，我发现许多领域的专家都会有这样的经历。当然，我在做手术的时候，并没有想到其他领域。我是个实习外科医生，用我的科学知识和身体技能帮助伤者康复。我从未想过我可以向裁缝、音乐家、发型设计师或战斗机飞行员学习。几十年后的今天，我希望我当时能意识到这一点。

### 2.2 成为全科医生

Becoming a general practitioner

In the years that followed, operating on patients like Simon became routine. Some of the most urgent had been stabbed in the heart. We usually had several of these over a weekend, sometimes more. In the end, I became used to running at full tilt down the corridor to the operating theatre with a patient whose heart was on the verge of stopping. A few moments to transfer the patient onto the table, then making a skin incision, splitting the breastbone with a hammer and chisel, slitting open the pericardial sac and putting a stitch in a spurting ventricle. Once things were under control we could all take a breather while the patient's blood pressure came up and ours went down, before we started closing the chest.

After almost three years at Bara, I felt I was getting the hang of trauma surgery. I wanted to broaden my experience, so I moved to Cape Town. I'd decided to continue my training at Groote Schuur, the university hospital famous for the world's first heart transplant, performed by Christiaan Barnard in 1967. At Groote Schuur I was still treating a lot of trauma patients, but I also worked for some of the world's leading experts in liver disease, intestinal surgery, neurosurgery, paediatric surgery and intensive care. By rotating through these specialities I gained a broad experience which later proved invaluable. I took my FRCS exams, became a consultant, and for a few months headed up the paediatric trauma unit at Cape Town's children's hospital. Nominally independent, I was making the transition from Apprentice to Journeyman.

By then I had been in South Africa for more than five years, but I'd never intended to stay there. My parents lived in London and my mother had become seriously ill with cancer. It was time to go home. Before returning, though, I spent several months as a consultant surgeon in Oshakati, a small town in a remote part of Namibia and home to the Owambo people. I discovered when I got there that Oshakati was on the border with Angola, and at that time South Africa and Angola were at war. Although I'd seen a lot of trauma, I'd never worked in an actual war zone and I hadn't realized how dangerous it would be. I found myself catapulted into a world that was like nothing I'd ever experienced. In every sense, it was a baptism of fire.

Above all, it was lonely. In Cape Town there was always someone to ask if I got really stuck. In Oshakati, I was on my own. The hospital was huge, and the surgical section alone had more than two hundred beds. But it was chronically short-staffed, and the surgeon in charge when I arrived had been working without a break for more than three years. He had a suitcase in his hand when I got there – he left the same day and I never saw him again. I found myself responsible for the two hundred surgical patients, with only two junior doctors to help me.

In Oshakati, I had to grow up fast. As well as the patients already on the wards, new ones with serious injuries poured in every day. Most of the time I was way outside my comfort zone. Along with day-to-day surgical problems, like draining abscesses and dealing with appendicitis, I had to look after people who had been blown up by roadside explosive devices or hit by rockets, often suffering appalling injuries. I had to learn to improvise, performing operations I'd heard of but never seen – let alone done.

Some of the most horrifying injuries were from phosphorus grenades. The phosphorus would burn its way into the patient's skin and was almost impossible to remove. One of the Owambo theatre sisters showed me what to do. You give the patient a general anaesthetic, put them on the operating table, then turn out all the lights. You see which parts of the patient glow in the dark, then cut them away with a scalpel or root them out with a wire brush. It was nightmarish. No one had ever mentioned phosphorus grenades when I was a houseman in North Wales.

This is what I mean by saying that the path to becoming expert isn't linear. In Oshakati, I was developing my voice as a Journeyman surgeon, but the demands of the work greatly outstripped my knowledge and confidence. I was taking responsibility for my decisions, and sometimes I got things wrong. Then my patients and I had to cope with the consequences.

When the time came for me to return to England I'd reached another watershed in my career. As a surgeon in Africa I'd spent a lot of time operating, then looking after my patients as they started to recover. But once they had been discharged from hospital, I never saw them again. I realized that, for me, there was something missing. I wanted to follow the stories of my patients over years, rather than days or weeks. And I wanted to experience other kinds of medicine.

One day while I was still in Cape Town, I had been leafing through the back pages of an out-of-date issue of the British Medical Journal . I spotted an advertisement for a one-year general practitioner (GP) trainee post in Lichfield, near Birmingham, in the English Midlands. The closing date had long passed, but I posted off an application anyway. A few weeks later, to my astonishment, they wrote back and offered me the position. So I ended up changing direction and retrained as a GP – a family doctor. It was a big step to take and my friends all thought I was mad. I knew it was a risk, but I thought it would be fascinating. And it was.

Changing from surgery to general practice was tough. I had to do a second apprenticeship. I learned a huge amount in my year as a GP trainee, though most of it wasn't new facts or techniques so much as new ways of putting my knowledge together. I wasn't quite back to square one, but I did have to learn a completely different kind of medicine.

When my year as a trainee was over, I started looking for a practice to join. Those were competitive times for GPs, and there were often more than 150 applicants for sought-after positions. I was lucky. I was offered a partnership with seven GPs in Trowbridge, a smallish town about a hundred miles from London. I was there for the next seventeen years, long enough to pass through several of the steps in this book. At first I was a greenhorn Journeyman, taking responsibility for my work but still with a great deal to learn. As my confidence grew, I developed my personal style as a GP. In time I began to pass my knowledge on, to teach and support other doctors as they in turn became expert.

As a GP, I developed a different way of applying the knowledge and skills I had acquired as a hospital specialist. I drew on my surgical training, but whereas in surgery you work with a patient very intensely over a relatively brief period of time, in general practice it's the opposite. You get to know your patients through repeated short encounters spread out over many years. I had the freedom to develop my own style – or what I describe in this book as ‘voice'.

在接下来的几年里，给西蒙这样的患者做手术成了例行工作。有些最紧急的患者被人刺伤了心脏。我们在周末通常会有好几例这样的患者，有时会更多。最后，我已经习惯于全速跑过走廊，去手术室为心脏快要停止跳动的患者动手术。片刻之间，我们把患者抬到手术台上，然后切开皮肤，用锤子和凿子劈开胸骨，切开心包囊，在喷血的心室上缝合。一旦情况得到控制，患者的血压上升，我们的血压下降，我们就能松一口气了，然后我们再缝合胸腔。

在巴拉瓜纳医院工作近三年之后，我觉得我已经掌握了创伤外科手术的窍门。我想丰富自己的经验，于是搬到了开普敦。

我决定在格罗特·舒尔医院继续我的训练，这所大学附属医院因世界上第一台心脏移植手术而闻名 —— 于 1967 年由克里斯蒂安、巴纳德（Christiaan Barnard）操刀。在格罗特·舒尔医院、我仍要治疗许多创伤患者，但我也在一些肝病、肠道外科、神经外科、小几外科和重症监护领域的世界一流专家手下工作过。在这些专业领域轮转，我获得了广泛的经验，事实证明这些经验是无价的。我参加了皇家外科学院终极院士资格考试，成了一名顾问医师，在开普敦儿童医院担任了几个月的小儿创伤科主任。我在名义上独立了，因此正在从学徒过渡到熟练工。

那时，我已经在南非待了五年多，但我从未打算在那里一直待下去。我父母住在伦敦，母亲患上了癌症，病情严重。我该回家了。不过在回国之前，我在奥沙卡蒂做了几个月外科顾问医师。那是纳米比亚的一个偏远小镇，也是奥万博人的故乡。到达那里的时候，我发现奥沙卡蒂位于靠近安哥拉的边境上，当时南非和安哥拉在打仗。虽然我见过很多创伤，但从未在真正的战区工作过，也没有意识到那里有多危险。我发现自己被推进了一个从未见过的世界。从任何意义上讲，这都是一次烈火的洗礼。

最难熬的是，我很孤独。在开普敦的时候，总有人问我是不是陷入了困境。在奥沙卡蒂，我才是真正的孤立无援。医院很大，光是外科就有两百多张病床，但是医院长期人手不足。我去那儿的时候，负责手术的外科医生已经连续工作三年多没有休息了。我到医院时，他手里拿着一个手提箱 —— 他当天就离开了，我再也没见过他。我发现自己要负责 200 个外科患者，只有两个实习医生协助我。

在奥沙卡蒂，我必须快速成长。除了已经在病房里的患者，每天还有新的重伤患者涌入。大部分时间里，我的工作都不是我能轻松应对的。除了日常的外科问题以外（比如给脓肿引流、处理阑尾炎），我还得照顾那些被路边爆炸装置炸伤或者被火箭弹击中的人，他们的伤势通常非常可怕。我必须学会随机应变，做那些我听过但从未见过的手术 —— 更别提做过了。

有些最可怕的伤口是白磷榴弹造成的。磷会灼烧患者的皮肤，几乎不可能去除。一位在手术室工作的奥万博姐妹教会了我该怎么做。你要给患者做全身麻醉，把他们放在手术台上，然后关掉所有的灯。你会看见患者的哪些身体部位在黑暗中发光，然后用手术刀把这些部位切掉，或者用钢丝刷将其刮掉。这就像噩梦一样。我在北威尔士做实习医生的时候，从没有人提过白磷榴弹。

这就是我所说的「成为专家之路不是平坦的直线」。在奥沙卡蒂，我在培养自己作为外科熟练工的「声音」，但这项工作的要求远远超过了我的知识与信心。我要为自己的决定负责，而我有时会犯错。然后我的患者和我就不得不面对这些后果。

当回到英格兰的时候，我来到了职业生涯的另一个转折点。作为一名在非洲行医多年的外科医生，我花了很长时间做手术，然后在患者开始康复的时候照料他们。可他们一出院，我就再也见不到他们了。我意识到，对我来说，这样的工作缺少了一些东西。我想了解患者之后多年的故事，而不是几天或几周里的事情。我也想了解其他门类的医学。

还在开普敦的时候，有一天我正在翻看一本过期的《英国医学杂志》（British Medical Journal）的最后几页。我看到一则英格兰中部城市利奇菲尔德（靠近伯明翰）招聘实习全科医生的广告，实习期为一年。截止日期早已过去，但我还是寄出了申请书。令我惊讶的是，几周后，他们回信给我，把这个职位给了我。所以我最后改变了自己的专业方向，重新接受培训，成为一名全科医生 —— 一名家庭医生。这个跨度很大，我的朋友们都认为我疯了。我知道这有些冒险，但我觉得这会很有趣。的确很有趣。

从外科转到全科很难。我还得再做一次学徒。在我做全科实习医生的时候，我学到了很多东西，不过大部分都不是新的知识或技术，而是将我的知识组合在一起的新方法。我没有完全回到起点，但我确实必须学习另一种医学。

在实习的一年结束后，我开始寻找工作机会。那时全科医生的竞争很激烈，抢手的职位经常有超过 150 个申请者。我很幸运。我得到了一个在特罗布里奇与七名全科医生合作的机会。特罗布里奇是一个距离伦敦大约 100 英里的小镇。我在那里度过了接下来的 17 年，这段时间足够让我经历本书中的几个步骤。起初，我是个初出茅庐的熟练工，为自己的工作负责，但仍有很多需要学习的东西。随着自信的增长，我开始形成自己作为全科医生的风格。随着时间的推移，我开始传授我的知识，教导和支持其他医生，而他们也逐渐成了专家。

作为全科医生，我逐渐开始用一种不同的方式来运用我从医院专科医生的生涯中所获得的知识和技能。我从外科训练中受益匪浅。不过在外科的工作中，你要在相对较短的时间里与患者做高强度的工作，而在全科的工作中，情况恰恰相反。你要通过多年来短暂、多次的接触来了解你的患者。我拥有形成自己风格的自由 —— 换言之，那就是我在本书中讲的「声音」。

### 2.3 成为学者

Becoming an academic

Once I was settled in my practice, I developed a teaching programme for GPs who wanted to carry out minor surgery. But when I tried to crystallize the surgical knowledge from my earlier career, I found it surprisingly difficult. I tried several approaches, including writing a textbook, but none of them really worked. I knew from my experience with surgical patients like Simon that books weren't always helpful, so in the end I developed a multimedia programme, working with a dermatology consultant (Julia Schofield), a recently formed simulation company (Limbs & Things) and an anatomical graphics company (Primal Pictures). We combined silicon models and computer graphics, so clinicians could practise surgical techniques at home.

Although I'd done a lot of teaching by then, I'd never studied education formally. I wanted to find out more, so I did a PhD at the nearby University of Bath. As I was studying, I linked my own experiences of teaching and learning to what people outside my field had written. I read their books, examined their theories, and tried to match them with my own ideas. That led to a third career change and took me to Imperial College London, the university where I now work.

At Imperial the wheel came full circle and I found myself with surgeons again. This time, though, I was teaching them about education rather than doing operations myself. I established a Master of Education (MEd) in Surgical Education, which for many years was the only one of its kind in the world. At the same time, I created simulations that integrated the physical skills of operating with the human skills of caring for sick people. I built a research group which has developed low-cost yet realistic recreations of surgery that can be carried in the back of a car and set up anywhere. Working with design engineers, we even developed an inflatable ‘igloo', using lightweight props to recreate the sense of being in an operating theatre without requiring extensive equipment.

My first idea had been to use this portable simulation for training surgical teams. An epiphany came when I realized it could be used in a different way – to invite patients and members of the public to see what goes on inside an operating theatre and even take part in a simulated operation. We developed the idea of ‘reciprocal illumination', a change in perspective for everyone who took part – surgeons, patients and the public.

These simulations enabled discussions with people who often felt excluded from the worlds of medicine and science. I became fascinated by public engagement, as it's called, and over the next few years this became the focus of my work. With the others in my group I put on literally hundreds of events at science festivals, museums, street fairs, public parks and music venues. In these events, I wasn't focusing on the details of anatomy and disease. Instead I was exploring the performance and craftsmanship of surgery. That led to what has become my main research – exploring points of connection with experts outside medicine.

Imperial College London is ideally placed for this. Within a few yards of the main university campus, in London's South Kensington, are some of the world's leading museums and institutions. These include the Science Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, Royal College of Art and Royal College of Music. Not far away are the Art Workers' Guild, the City and Guilds of London Art School, the Royal Academy of Arts and the Wellcome Trust. Over the years I've developed connections with all of them.

Some of these connections have become more formal, such as the Royal College of Music and Imperial College London's Centre for Performance Science, which my RCM colleague Aaron Williamon and I established and jointly lead. In 2019, I became the Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy of Arts, a post first held by the famous anatomist William Hunter in 1769. Today, I work across many disciplinary boundaries to find out what it means to become expert.

我的实践工作稳定下来之后，我就为那些想做小手术的全科医生开办了一门课程。但是，一旦我试图将我从早期职业生涯中得来的外科知识具体地讲授出来，我就发现这难得出奇。

我试了几种方法，包括写教材，但没有一种方法真正奏效。治疗像西蒙这样的外科患者的经验告诉我，书籍并不总是有用的，所以我最后与皮肤科顾问医师朱莉亚·斯科菲尔德（Julia Schofield）、新成立的医疗模拟产品公司 Limbs ＆ Things，以及解剖学图形公司 Primal Pictures 合作，开发了一款多媒体软件。我们将硅胶模型和计算机图形结合在了一起，这样医生就可以在家里练习外科技术。

尽管我在此之前已经做了很多教学工作，但我从未正式研究过教育。我想了解更多，于是在附近的巴斯大学取得了哲学博士学位。在学习的时候，我把自己的教学和学习经验与我领域外的人所写的东西联系在了一起。我读了他们的书，研究了他们的理论，并试图将这些东西与我自己的想法结合起来。这促使我做出了第三次职业转型，来到了帝国理工学院，也就是我目前供职的大学。

我在帝国理工学院又回到了最初的起点，我发现自己又和外科医生待在一起了。但这一次，我是在教他们有关教育学的知识，而不是自己动手做手术。我在外科教育学方向创立了一个教育学硕士学位。多年以来，这个学位在世界上是独一无二的。与此同时，我创造的模拟设备将做手术的身体技能与照料患者的人际技能结合在了一起。我建立了一个研究小组，开发了成本低廉又逼真的外科手术复制品，它可以放进汽车的后备厢，在任何地方组装。我们甚至还与设计工程师合作，开发了一种可充气的「小屋」，你可以用轻便的道具来模拟置身于手术室的感觉，而不需要大量的设备。

我的第一个想法是用这种便携式的模拟设备来训练外科手术团队。当我意识到可以用不同的方法来利用这种设备时，我产生了顿悟－- 我可以邀请患者和公众参观手术室，甚至参加模拟手术。我们提出了「相互启发」的理念，它改变了每个参与者的视角 —— 外科医生、患者与公众。

这些模拟设备能让那些经常感觉被排斥在医学和科学世界之外的人参与讨论。我喜欢上了公众参与，在接下来的几年里，这成了我工作的焦点。我和团队里的其他人一起，在科学节、博物馆、街头集市、公园和音乐演出场所举办了数百场活动。在这些活动中，我关注的不是解剖学与疾病的细节。相反，我探索的是外科手术的呈现与技艺。这后来引出了我的主要研究领域 —— 探索能够与医学领域之外的专家产生联系的地方。伦敦帝国理工学院是从事这项工作的理想场所。在伦敦南肯辛顿主校区的几码之内，就坐落着一些世界上最好的博物馆和相关机构。其中包括科学博物馆、维多利亚与艾尔伯特博物馆、自然历史博物馆、皇家艺术学院与皇家音乐学院。不远处还有艺术工作者行会、伦敦城市与行业协会艺术学校、皇家美术学院和惠康信托基金会。多年以来，我和所有这些机构都建立了关系。

1 码≈0.91 米。

有些关系变得更加正式了，比如皇家音乐学院与伦敦帝国理工学院表现科学中心（Centre for Performance Science）的成立。该中心是由我在皇家音乐学院的同事亚伦·威廉蒙（Aaron Williamon）和我成立并共同负责的。2019 年，我成为皇家美术学院的解剖学教授，这一职位最早由著名解剖学家威廉·亨特（William Hunter）于 1769 年担任。今天，我跨越了许多学科的边界，试图弄清成为专家意味着什么。

### 2.4 裁缝

The tailor

Now to Joshua Byrne, the bespoke tailor whose ideas have influenced me so profoundly. We've both travelled from Apprentice to Master and we've both had ups and downs along the way. Though our fields are completely different, our paths have been uncannily similar.

I met Joshua on a hot summer's day in 2009, when I was developing my third career, as an academic. His workshop is near Savile Row, the London street which has been the heartland of bespoke tailoring for centuries. When I first saw him, Joshua was stooped over a half-made jacket, with the Test match commentary on the radio in the background. Tall, bearded and impeccably dressed, Joshua has a warm, attractive personality. I'd never talked to a tailor before and he'd never talked to a surgeon. Tailors and surgeons don't normally have the chance to meet, and I didn't know what to expect. He seemed as curious as I was about the idea that we might have anything in common.

The first thing I noticed was Joshua's technical skill, and how it chimed with my own experience. When he described how he makes a suit, I was struck by the way we both use sewing. As an apprentice, Joshua spent years with a needle and thread, putting sleeves on jackets and shaping the layers of a suit. I did something similar during my years as a surgeon, joining intestines or blood vessels. As we talked, we discovered more common ground. It turned out that we had each been through two apprenticeships – one focusing on technical skill, the other more about people. We were each fascinated by the principles of our craft and the ideas that underpin it.

Halfway through his second year at university, studying agriculture and economics, Joshua by chance saw a film with a brief scene in a tailor's workshop. Suddenly, he realized that was what he wanted to do. There weren't any tailoring opportunities in Edinburgh at that time, so he left university and went to London to become an apprentice. Like Derek the taxidermist, Joshua had had an epiphany which changed the course of his career.

Joshua explained to me that there are two kinds of tailors. ‘Making' (or ‘sewing') tailors are the experts in construction. They build suits and jackets to the specifications of a ‘cutting' tailor, who designs the garment and interacts with the customer. Both kinds of tailor are highly skilled, but their work is different and they inhabit separate worlds. An apprentice will usually choose one or the other, then stay on that side of the business throughout their career. But Joshua didn't do that; he trained in both. I had done something similar, changing from surgery to general practice. In doing two apprenticeships within the same world, we are both unusual within our fields.

I asked Joshua to give me a glimpse of a ‘making' tailor's work. He showed me how he sews a sleeve onto a jacket. Watching him use a needle and thread with effortless grace took me back to my time as a surgeon, suturing stab wounds in Africa. So I asked him to let me try some sewing. Even though it had been over two decades since I last performed a major operation, I thought it would be pretty straightforward. After all, I'd had years of experience – how difficult could it be?

With a jacket on my lap, a needle in my hand and only the window for a light, I found out. I felt completely useless. I floundered, unable to do the simplest thing. I seemed to have lost all those sewing skills I'd spent years perfecting. It was horrible.

Thinking about it afterwards, I realized that despite the apparent similarities between our skills, our ways of working were completely different. I was used to operating in a team, standing up under a bright light in a surgical gown and latex gloves, with people handing me instruments and sutures when I needed them and taking them away when I'd finished. Every time I wanted to put in a stitch, an expert colleague like Sister Ramaphosa would pass me a curved needle mounted on a special instrument.

In Joshua's studio all that had gone. Tailors work alone. They use straight needles, holding them directly in their fingers rather than using instruments, and there's no one to hand things over or take them away. This made me question what I thought I knew about becoming expert. I realized my skill only made sense within its setting. Changing the context by visiting Joshua had brought that abruptly into view. Away from my team I felt adrift.

Though Joshua's work and mine are different, we'd had similar experiences as we travelled the path to becoming expert. As a beginner (an Apprentice) he had to do things without understanding why. He became skilled in the techniques of his trade and gained a deep understanding of the textiles and cloth he worked with. He'd had teachers who were inspiring and supportive, but also others who were critical and hostile. Later, as an independent craftsman (a Journeyman), he developed his voice – taking risks and striking out on his own. Now, as an expert (a Master), he was articulating that knowledge and passing it on. In my time as a junior doctor, a surgical trainee in South Africa, a consultant surgeon in Namibia, a GP in rural England and a university academic in London, I'd been through those stages too.

Since our first meeting, I've spent a lot of time with Joshua. At this point in our careers we're both trying to convey our knowledge to people less experienced than ourselves. Through our conversations, we've explored what it means to be expert, and every year Joshua takes part in the master's programme I lead at Imperial. This isn't just Joshua telling my students and me about tailoring; that's interesting, but not especially relevant to us as surgeons. It's also looking at how tailors become tailors, which makes us think about how surgeons become surgeons and why. As you read on, you might think about how surgeons becoming surgeons, tailors becoming tailors – or anybody becoming anything – shines a light on your own path, and why you're walking down it.

现在谈谈约书亚·伯恩，这位定制裁缝的理念对我影响极深。我们都经历了从学徒到大师的过程，一路上都有起起伏伏。虽然我们的专业领域完全不同，但我们的道路却出奇地相似。2009 年的一个炎热的夏天，我遇见了约书亚，当时我正在发展自己的第三份职业 —— 学者。约书亚的工作室位于萨维尔街附近。几个世纪以来，伦敦的这条街道一直是定制裁缝的圣地。我第一次见到约书亚时，他正弯着腰，面前是一件做了一半的西装上衣，收音机里放着板球比赛的解说。约书亚身材高大，留着络腮胡，衣着得体，性格温和，散发着人格魅力。我从没有和裁缝说过话，他也从没有和外科医生说过话。裁缝和外科医生通常没有机会见面，我也不知道会发生什么。他似乎和我一样好奇，想知道我们能有什么共同之处。

我注意到的第一件事就是约书亚的专业技术，以及这种技术与我自身的经验有何共通之处。当他讲述如何制作西装时，我对我们俩都会用到的缝线方式感到惊讶。在学徒时期，约书亚花了数年时间学习针线，把袖子缝在上衣上，为西装的多层面料定型。我在做外科医生的时候也做过类似的事情 —— 缝合肠子或血管。随着谈话的进行，我们发现了更多的共同点。原来我们两人都经历过两次学徒期：一次关注专业技能，另一次更关注人。我们都对我们技艺的原则和支撑这门技艺的理念着迷。

约书亚在大学里的专业是农业与经济学。在二年级的时候，他在一部电影里偶然看到了一个裁缝作坊的简短场景。突然，他意识到这就是他想做的。当时在爱丁堡没有做裁缝的机会，于是他离开大学，前往伦敦当学徒。就像标本剥制师德里克一样，约书亚的一个顿悟改变了他的职业生涯。

约书亚告诉我，裁缝分为两种。「制作」（或「缝纫」）裁缝是制造的专家。他们根据「剪裁」裁缝的具体要求制作西服套装和西装上衣，而后者负责设计服装并与顾客交流。两种裁缝的技巧都很高超，但他们的工作是不同的，属于不同的领域。学徒通常会选择其中一种方向，然后在整个职业生涯中一直从事裁缝行当的这一部分，但约书亚不是这样的，他在这两方面都受过训练。我也做过类似的事情，从外科医生转做全科医生。我们都在同一专业里做了两次学徒。这在我们的领域里，都是不同寻常的。

我请约书亚让我看看「制作」裁缝的工作。他向我展示了如何把袖子缝到西装上衣上。看着他轻松自如地使用针线，我回想起自己在非洲缝合刺伤的外科医生岁月。于是我请求他让我试试缝纫。尽管我上次做大手术已经是 20 多年前的事了，但我认为这很简单。毕竟我有多年的经验 —— 这能有多难呢？

西装上衣放在腿上，手里拿着针，唯一的光源是一扇窗，我顿时发现了这有多难。我完全不知所措。我手足无措，连这最简单的事情都做不到。我似乎失去了多年来一直在完善的缝合技巧。那感觉糟透了。

事后回想起来，我意识到尽管我们的技能有明显的相似之处，但我们的工作方式却完全不同。我习惯于在团队中做手术，穿着手术服，戴着乳胶手套，站在明亮的灯光下。在我需要的时候，会有人给我递来器械和缝合线。在我缝好后，会有人把它们拿走。每当我想下针的时候，像拉马福萨护士这样专业的同事就会递给我一根装在特殊器械上的弯曲的针。

在约书亚的工作室里，所有这些都不见了。裁缝独自工作。他们用的是直针，用手指直接拿针，而不是用器械，也没有人给他们递东西，或者把东西收走。这让我开始质疑自己对于成为专家的了解。我意识到，我的技能只有在相应的情境里才有意义。到了约书亚这里，我的情境就变了。这让我突然意识到了这一点。离开了团队，我感到不知所措。

虽然约书亚的工作与我不同，但我们在成为专家的道路上有着相似的经历。作为初学者（学徒），他不得不在不明就里的情况下做事。他逐渐熟练掌握了自己的手艺，并且对工作中用到的纺织品和布料有了深刻的了解。他的老师给了他很多鼓舞和支持，但也有一些持批评和敌对态度的人。后来，作为一名独立的手艺人（熟练工），他找到了自己的「声音」—— 敢于冒险，闯出自己的一片天地。现在，作为一名专家（大师），他正在阐述自己的知识，传承自己的技艺。在我做实习医生，在南非做外科实习医生，在纳米比亚做外科顾问医师，在英格兰乡村做全科医生，以及在伦敦做大学学者的时候，我也经历过这些阶段。

自从我们初次见面以来，我和约书亚花了很多时间相处。在我们职业生涯的这个时期，我们都在努力把我们的知识传达给比我们经验更少的人。通过我们的对话，我们探索了成为专家意味着什么。约书亚每年都会参与我在帝国理工学院开办的硕士课程。这不仅是为了让约书亚给我和我的学生讲述有关裁缝的事情（那很有趣，但和我们外科医生没有什么关系），也是为了研究裁缝如何成为裁缝，让我们思考外科医生如何以及为何成为外科医生。在阅读后面的内容时，你可能会想到外科医生如何成为外科医生，裁缝如何成为裁缝（或者任何专业的成长历程）。这会为你指明道路，让你明白你为什么会走在这条路上。

### 2.5 看看自己领域外的世界

Looking outside your field

I've never become an expert quite like Derek the taxidermist and I know I never will. I've never spent forty-five years in one field. But I've developed what the sociologist Harry Collins describes as ‘interactional expertise' – the ability to speak the language of experts whose work you cannot do. Collins distinguishes this from ‘contributory expertise' – the expertise of doing the work itself – which in my case is being a doctor and a teacher. Interactional expertise involves engaging with people outside your field. Most people have interactional expertise to some extent. Some, like journalists, make it their profession. Now it has become mine, too.

It's easy to imagine science, art and craft in watertight compartments. Yet we put ourselves in a straitjacket if we think of experts solely in terms of their occupation. Categories like medicine, tailoring or taxidermy emphasize difference, not similarity; we think of what makes these experts unique, not what they have in common. And we seldom find out how they got there, or how we can apply their knowledge to ourselves.

As Joshua and I have found out, there is a lot to learn from people outside your field. I'll never make a jacket and he'll never do an operation. But on a deeper level we understand one another's stories. We've both spent years learning something we believe in, and we've both had challenging times. We've struggled to gain physical skills. We've encountered difficult teachers, students, customers and patients. And we've looked beyond our field.

My conversations with Joshua and others have helped me talk my ideas into existence. Those conversations have been instrumental in shaping what I'm trying to say. As one of my patients once said to me, ‘How do I know what I think until I hear myself tell you?'

Though Joshua's experience and mine don't coincide precisely, he sums up what being expert means to me. Joshua is driven by a passion to be the finest tailor he can be, and to do the best possible work for his customers and clients. That, to me, is the essence of mastery.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Becoming expert is a long journey. At the start of this chapter I was in Emergency Theatre B at Bara in 1981, preparing to operate on Simon. My path had only just begun. I still remember that sick feeling as I wondered if I'd be able to cope with what I found inside his abdomen. Whatever your field, you'll have moments like that. The only solution is to build up experience, to do it over and over again. And that starts with doing time.

我从没有成为像标本剥制师德里克那样的专家，我知道我永远也不会。我从没有在一个领域里待上 45 年。但是我发展出了社会学家哈里·柯林斯（Harry Collins）所说的「互动型专长」—— 虽然你无法胜任一些专家的工作，但你能够说他们的语言。柯林斯将这种专长与「贡献型专长」（做工作本身的专长；就我个人而言，二者就是做教师和医生的工作）进行了区分。互动型专长要求你与自己领域外的人打交道。大多数人都有一定的互动型专长。有些人，比如记者，把互动型专长作为自己的职业技能。现在，它也成了我的职业技能。

人们很容易把科学、艺术和工艺看作神秘的东西，难以窥见其中的奥秘。然而，如果我们仅仅根据专家的职业来看待他们，我们就限制了自己的眼界。像医学、裁缝、标本剥制这样的分类强调差异，而不是共性；我们会考虑这些专家的独特之处，而不是他们的共同点。我们很少知道这些专家是如何走到这一步的，也不知道我们能如何将他们的知识运用到自己身上。

约书亚和我发现，在自身领域之外的人身上，还有许多东西值得学习。我永远也做不出西装上衣，而他也永远不会做手术，但在更深刻的层面上，我们都理解彼此的故事。我们都花了多年时间学习我们所相信的东西，我们都经历过充满挑战的时期。我们都曾努力习得身体技能。我们都遇见过难以应付的老师、学生、顾客和患者。我们的眼光也都超越了自身的领域。

我和约书亚及其他人的谈话，帮助我理清了自己的想法。这些对话对于我找到自己想说的话很有帮助。就像我的一位患者曾对我说的话：「如果不能听见自己亲口对你说，我怎么知道自己在想什么？」

虽然约书亚的经历与我并不完全一致，但他总结了成为专家对于我的意义。一腔热情驱使着约书亚，让他努力成为最好的裁缝，为顾客和客户做出最好的工作。在我看来，这就是掌握一门技艺的精髓。

但这是后话了。成为专家是一个漫长的过程。在本章开始的时候，我在 1981 年的巴拉瓜纳医院 B 紧急手术室，正准备给西蒙动手术。我的旅程才刚刚开始。我现在还记得怀疑自己能否处理他腹腔伤情时的那种恶心感。无论你的领域是什么，你都会有那样的时刻。唯一的解决方法就是积攒经验，一遍又一遍地做这件事。这就得从「积累」做起。
