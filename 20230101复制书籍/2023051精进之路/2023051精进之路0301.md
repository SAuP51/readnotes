0301 Doing time

It's a Sunday in Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1974 and I've been sent to do ‘the bloods'. For the whole morning I go from patient to patient, taking blood for routine preoperative tests. Nobody else wants to do this job, which is why I've been given it. It's the first time I've been in hospital as a medical student, and I'm feeling excited. Proudly wearing my new white coat, I've crammed my pockets with specimen tubes, syringes, needles and a wad of request forms. A harassed houseman (as newly qualified doctors were called at that time) showed me once what to do, then vanished, leaving me to face the ward on my own.

By now I'm halfway through my time at medical school. For three years I've been learning facts. I've spent hours in the dissecting room, memorizing anatomy. I've spent hours in the histology lab too, looking at slides under the microscope. I've learned about physiology, pharmacology and pathology. But I've never touched a patient.

My first two bloods are easy – patients with large juicy veins which are straightforward to puncture. My confidence blossoms, but not for long. It turns out I've had beginner's luck. Once reality kicks in, I discover that taking blood can be incredibly difficult. Some patients seem to have no veins at all, or thick hard ones like clay pipe stems, or deceptive ones that look easy but burst into huge bruises at the touch of a needle. Often I cause my patients pain as I try again and again. Although they're very understanding, I feel dreadful.

Even managing the kit is a challenge. I need at least four hands to hold the syringes, needles, tourniquets, sticking plasters and swabs. In spite of all the facts I've learned, when it comes to doing, I'm all thumbs. Just as bad are the triplicate forms, and the specimen tubes with tiny shiny labels which my biro won't write on properly. Yet unless I'm meticulous, the forms and tubes can get muddled up. That could be disastrous.

Quite apart from the physical skills of blood-taking, I have to develop ways of keeping track, ensuring I can put my hand on things when I need them. Nobody told me about that part. I've had to create a system for myself. It's tough, but gradually I get the hang of it, and after a few more Sundays I feel a lot more confident. A couple of months later, that new confidence takes another hit.

I've been sent to insert a cannula (‘put up a drip', as it's often called) in a patient who's been admitted on the emergency ‘take'. His blood pressure is low, the houseman is busy and I've been told to set up an intravenous infusion. I've seen it done, and it looked straightforward enough. After all, I've learned how to take blood now, so I should be able to put a cannula into a patient's vein. Then reality kicks in. Faced with a sick patient, a bag of sterile saline and yards of plastic tubing, I have no idea what to do. I'm back to square one.

1974 年的一个星期天，在曼彻斯特皇家医院，我被派去采血。整个上午，我在一个又一个患者之间忙个不停，为常规术前检查采血。没人愿意做这份工作，所以才派我来做。这是我作为医学生第一次到医院见习，我感到很兴奋。我自豪地穿着我的新白大褂，口袋里塞满了采样管、注射器、针头和一叠申请表。一个不胜其烦的实习医生（当时刚取得医师资格的医生被称为实习医生）给我示范了一遍该怎么做，然后就消失了，留下我一个人面对整个住院区。

那时我在医学院的求学生涯刚刚过去一半。三年来我一直在学习知识。我在解剖室里花了很多个小时，记忆解剖学知识。我也在组织学实验室里待过很多个小时，用显微镜观察玻片。我学过生理学、药理学和病理学。但是我从未接触过患者。

前两管血抽得很容易 —— 这两个患者的血管又粗又大，很容易刺穿。我信心满满，但很快就泄了气。事实证明，这只是初学者的运气而已。事实很快让我意识到，采血可能非常困难。有些患者似乎根本没有血管，有些患者的血管就像陶土烟杆一样又粗又硬，还有些人的血管很有欺骗性，看似简单，但针一下去就会出现大片淤青。我一次又一次地尝试，常常会给患者带来痛苦。虽然他们很善解人意，但我感觉很糟糕。

即便对我来说应对工具箱也是一项挑战。我至少需要四只手才能拿下注射器、针头、止血带、胶布和棉签。尽管我学了这么多知识，但在做事情的时候，我还是笨手笨脚的。一式三份的表格和贴着闪亮小标签的采样管也很难对付，我的圆珠笔没法正常地写出字来。如果我不小心，表格和采样管就会被弄混。那可就太糟糕了。

除了采血的身体技能以外，我还需要设法记住所有东西在哪儿，确保我在需要的时候能拿到。从没有人告诉过我这件事。

我必须自己想出一套管理办法。这很难，但我逐渐掌握了窍门，在几个周日之后，我觉得更有信心了。几个月后，我刚刚建立起的信心再次受到了打击。

我被派去给一个急诊患者插套管（俗称「打点滴」）。他的血压很低，实习医生正在忙碌，有人让我去准备静脉输液。我看别人做过这件事，看起来很简单。毕竟，我现在已经学会采血了，把套管插入患者的血管应该也不是问题。然后事实给我泼了一盆冷水。面对一个患者、一袋无菌生理盐水和几米长的塑料管，我完全无从下手。我又回到了原点。

### 3.1 重复劳动的价值

The value of repetitive work

If you've struggled to get the hang of something new, you'll be familiar with this frustration. It goes with the territory of being an Apprentice. Joshua the tailor experienced something similar when he started learning to be a jacket-maker. At that stage he wasn't designing three-piece suits, any more than I was performing operations. He was in a workshop in the house of his master, Ron, making pocket flaps. He made hundreds of them, and they drove him round the bend.

Pocket flaps aren't as simple as they sound. They have to be cut with great precision so they fit the subtle curve of a jacket and don't gape when it moves. They have to be sewn with accuracy and they must look perfect. But making them is repetitive and tedious. Ron had an exacting nature and insisted on the highest standards in his workshop, but he wasn't a natural teacher. Every so often he would look at Joshua's work, then shake his head and say, ‘No.' No explanation, just ‘No'. He wasn't satisfied, but he never said why. So Joshua had to keep on making more pocket flaps. He almost went out of his mind with boredom.

Sometimes, like me with the bloods, Joshua would have beginner's luck. He'd make a pocket flap that Ron was happy with. But that was just a fluke, and Joshua couldn't recreate it. For a long time, he couldn't tell how he was doing. But gradually he began to recognize when his own workmanship was good and when it was still flawed. All that repetition meant that Joshua became able to set the standards for his work and develop consistency. At last Ron was satisfied and allowed him to move on to other tasks, though to this day, when Joshua thinks of pocket flaps he thinks of boring repetitive tasks of no apparent value. Yet, as we'll see, the pocket flaps of this world do have value. Without that experience, Joshua would never have become the master tailor he is today. Likewise, without doing the bloods, I'd never have become a surgeon. There's an equivalent in every field.

Of course, it wasn't just pocket flaps. All through those years as an apprentice, Joshua was doing many kinds of repetitive work. After pocket flaps came making buttonholes, stitching edges, ‘felling' linings, inserting padding and shaping lapels. Later he was entrusted with more difficult tasks, like putting in sleeves, collars and under-canvas. But each task required repetition, and it soon became tedious.

I went through something similar as my career developed. Being a medical student was frustrating enough, but once I qualified things got a lot worse. A large part of my work when I became a houseman involved taking more blood, unblocking urinary catheters and siting intravenous drips – usually in the middle of a night on call, when I'd just got back to sleep. Boring, repetitive tasks. Important to the patient, of course, but of no apparent value to me. In time I became adept at doing these tasks, but I couldn't see why it needed six years at medical school to stick needles into people's veins. Why couldn't someone else do it?

But this was the first step on my path to becoming expert. Here, you're so inexperienced that you don't even know what you don't know. You can't see the bigger picture. Your fingers are all thumbs. Often you're scared and bored at the same time. You're thinking about yourself.

All the experts I've talked to told me a similar story.

Paul Jakeman is now one of the country's leading historic stone carvers. Soon after I met him, he showed me the massive stone unicorn he carved for the steeple of St George's, Bloomsbury, in central London. Weighing several tons, it replaces the original in what is one of Nicholas Hawksmoor's iconic churches. But Paul hasn't always been carving unicorns. When he started his stone-carving apprenticeship several decades ago, he had no idea what to expect.

He'd imagined himself on a high ladder, restoring medieval statues in an English cathedral. But instead he spent weeks sweeping up stone dust in the mason's yard and making the tea. The first task his master set him was to create a perfectly flat horizontal surface in a block of stone, using only a chisel and a dummy (a mason's mallet). As the months went past and his block of stone grew smaller, he almost went out of his mind with boredom. Finally he showed his work to his master, who declared himself satisfied. At last, Paul thought, the real work would begin. But he spent the next six months with another block of stone, this time creating a perfectly flat vertical surface. He almost went out of his mind with boredom – again. But it wasn't until he'd mastered those basics that he was ready to go near anything that mattered.

So how can you make sense of this repetitive work? As you struggle with pocket flaps, or bloods, or vertical stone surfaces during your first apprenticeship, you discover something important. As Joshua put it to me: you can allow yourself to go out of your mind with frustration, switching off your brain and letting your mind wander as you endure the tedium. Or you can do something about it.

The secret to coping with boredom is to focus on doing each task as well as you possibly can – whatever that task is. It may sound obvious, but it's up to you to decide whether you find something boring, and you can change that if you choose. By paying close attention to tedious work, you reframe it. Instead of being a waste of time, it becomes a means of moving forward. You shift your focus from the frustration of the task to the skills you are gaining by doing it. Joshua told me that he came to see pocket flaps as an opportunity to hone his skills. The expert sewing he showed when I first met him would never have developed without that repetition.

By deciding to be ‘present' in his work and concentrate on it fully, Joshua made rapid progress. He became familiar with his materials. He reframed that never-ending pile of pocket flaps as a series of opportunities to improve and develop. If he had been listening to the radio or chatting to a friend while he worked, he wouldn't have been paying attention. He might have learned how to do the tasks, but he would never have found out why he was doing them. He wouldn't have progressed. Paul the stone carver had a similar experience. By gritting his teeth and perfecting those horizontal and vertical surfaces, he laid the foundations for the effortless skill he eventually developed.

The reality is that in any job there's a lot that's tedious, but it just has to be done. Nobody is entitled not to be bored. Unless you find ways of accepting that, you're likely to have a hard time. Yet in our climate of immediate gratification and continual stimulation, coping with tasks that are inherently boring is becoming a lost art. We tend to think that tedious tasks should be hived off, to technology or to other people. But this is missing the point. The boring bits are part of the work. Bypass them and you lose something essential.

For many experts, the boring parts remain central to what they do throughout their career. Andrew Garlick has been making harpsichords for over forty-five years, and his instruments are in demand all over the world. His signature instrument is a double-manual harpsichord, based on a 1749 French masterpiece by Goujon that is today housed in a Parisian museum.

Andrew makes every part of each harpsichord himself. From shaping the soundboard and cutting out the keys, to stringing the instrument and painting the case, he does it all by hand. It's very labour-intensive, and he can only make five harpsichords a year. I asked him if he had help for doing the boring bits, and he said no. For him, the boring bits are part of the satisfaction of making a whole instrument, of knowing that he has created everything from start to finish. Although cutting all those keys is a tedious task that somebody else could do, Andrew recognizes that it's part of doing ‘good work'. Boring or not, he has reframed it as worthwhile. The tedious tasks are part of being responsible for the work he does. That responsibility is part of becoming expert.

如果你一直难以掌握某件新事物的诀窍，你就会熟悉这种挫败感。这是学徒阶段必然会有的经历。裁缝约书亚在开始学做西装时，也有过类似的经历。在那个阶段，他做的不是设计三件套西装，就像我不是在做手术一样。他在师父罗恩家的工坊里做袋盖。他做了好几百个袋盖，这让他苦不堪言。

做袋盖不像听起来那么简单。袋盖必须经过非常精确的剪裁，才能贴合西装的精致的曲线，这样在移动时衣袋才不会开口。袋盖必须缝得极其精准，看起来必须完美，但制作过程却是重复乏味的。罗恩要求严格，在自己的工坊里秉持最高的标准，但他不擅长教学。他会时不时地扫一眼约书亚的作品，然后摇摇头说：「不行。」没有解释，只有「不行」。他并不满意，但从来不说为什么。于是约书亚不得不继续做袋盖。他无聊得几乎要发疯了。

就像我刚开始采血一样，约书亚也会有初学者的运气。他有时也能做出让罗恩满意的袋盖，但那只是侥幸，约书亚没法再做出一个这样的袋盖。很长一段时间里，他都不知道自己做得怎么样。渐渐地，他开始能分辨出自己的手艺什么时候好，什么时候不好。所有这些重复劳动让约书亚能够为自己的工作设定标准，提高工作水平的一致性。最后，罗恩满意了，就允许他去做别的事情了。直到今天，约书亚一想到袋盖，就会想起那些无聊的、重复的、没有明显价值的事情。然而，我们会看到，袋盖在这个世界上的确有其价值。如果没有这段经历，约书亚就不可能成为今天的裁缝大师。同样地，如果没做过采血，我也不可能成为外科医生。每个领域内都有类似的事情。

当然，约书亚做的不仅仅是袋盖。在那些年里，约书亚做了许多重复的劳动。在袋盖之后，他还做过纽扣孔、缝过边缘、缝过里布、插过垫料、给翻领定过型。后来，他还被委以更困难的任务，如缝合袖子、领子和内麻衬。但是每项任务都需要重复，很快就会变得单调乏味。

我在职业发展的过程中也有过类似的经历。作为一名医学生已经够让人沮丧的了，但你一旦获得医师资格，情况就会变得更糟糕。在我成为实习医生的时候，我的大部分工作都涉及采集更多的血液、疏通导尿管、插静脉滴注套管 —— 通常是在半夜我刚睡着的时候被叫起来。全是一些无聊、重复性的任务。

当然这些对患者很重要，但对我没有明显的价值。随着时间的推移，我变得很擅长这些任务，但我不明白为什么要在医学院里学六年才能把针扎进人的血管里。为什么不能让别人去做？

但这是我成为专家的第一步。在这个时候，你太缺乏经验了，甚至不知道自己不知道什么。你看不到全局。你笨手笨脚。

你常常既感到害怕，又感到无聊。你在想着自己。与我交流过的所有专家都给我讲过类似的故事。保罗·杰克曼（Paul Jakeman）是当下英国最著名的历史石雕大师之一。我见到他后不久，他就给我看了他为伦敦市中心布鲁姆斯伯里区的圣乔治教堂尖塔雕刻的巨大独角兽石雕。

这个石雕重达数吨，取代了一座原本位于此处的尼古拉斯·霍克斯莫尔（Nicholas Hawksmoor）的标志性教堂。但是，保罗并不是一直都在雕刻独角兽。几十年前，在他开始做石匠学徒的时候，他不知道自己会遇到什么事情。

保罗曾想象自己站在高高的梯子上，修复英格兰教堂里的中世纪雕像。但是，他却花了好几周的时间打扫石匠院子里的石屑和泡茶。师父给他的第一项任务，就是在一块石头上雕出一个完美的水平面，只能用凿子和石匠槌。几个月过去了，他的那块石头越来越小，而他无聊得几乎要发疯了。最后，他把自己的作品拿给师父看，师父表示满意。保罗想，终于可以开始做真正的工作了。但是在接下来的六个月里，他一直在打磨另一块石头，这次他要雕出一个完美的垂直面。他再次无聊得几乎要发疯了。但只有在掌握这些基本技巧以后，他才能尝试做其他重要的事情。

所以，该如何理解这种重复劳动呢？在学徒阶段，当你摸索着制作袋盖、采血或者在石头上雕刻垂直面时，你会发现一些重要的东西。正如约书亚对我说的：你可以任由自己因沮丧而失去理智，在忍受无聊时封闭自己的大脑，让自己走神；你也可以对此做点儿什么。

应对无聊的秘诀就是尽你所能地专注于每一项任务 —— 无论任务是什么。这听起来可能像是废话，但只有你能决定自己是否觉得某件事情无聊 —— 而且如果你愿意，就能改变这种现状。通过密切关注乏味的工作，你就能赋予它新的意义。这样一来，这种工作就不再是浪费时间，而是一种进步的方式。你要把关注点从这项任务带来的挫败感上转移到你从中获得的技能上。约书亚告诉我，他把制作袋盖看作磨炼技能的机会。如果没有重复，他就不会发展出我们初次见面时展现出来的高超缝纫技术。

通过全神贯注地「投入」工作，约书亚取得了快速的进步。他熟悉了他的工作内容。他给那种没完没了地制作袋盖的工作赋予了新的意义：进步和发展的机会。如果他在工作时收听广播或和朋友聊天，就不会专心工作。那样即便他已经学会了如何做这些事情，也永远不会弄清自己为什么要做。他不会进步。

石匠保罗也有类似的经历。通过咬紧牙关、不断完善石雕上的水平面和垂直面，他为自己打下了基础，最终发展出了那种毫不费力的技巧。

事实上，任何工作中都有许多乏味的事情，但那是必须去做的。没有人有权利摆脱无聊。除非你能设法接受这一事实，否则你可能会度日如年。然而，我们的社会环境需要即时满足和持续刺激，处理无聊任务的能力正在成为一种失落的技艺。

我们倾向于认为乏味的工作应该被分割出来，交给科技或其他人来做，但这样会错失其中的重点。无聊的事情是工作的一部分。避开这些部分，你就会失去一些至关重要的东西。

对于许多专家来说，无聊的部分仍然是他们本职工作中的核心部分。安德鲁·加里克（Andrew Garlick）制作羽管键琴已经超过 45 年了，他的乐器在世界各地都很受欢迎。他制作的标志性乐器是双层羽管键琴，其原型是古戎（Goujon）在法国于 1749 年制作的杰作（如今收藏在巴黎的一家博物馆里）。

每台羽管键琴的每个部件都是安德鲁自己制作的。制作音板、雕刻琴键、上弦、涂漆，都是他手工完成的。这是一项繁重的劳动，他一年只能制作五台羽管键琴。我问他有没有人帮他做这些无聊的事，他说没有。制造一台完整的乐器，知道自己从头到尾创造了这台乐器的一切，会给他带来一种满足感；

对他来说，这些无聊的部分是这种满足感的一部分。虽然雕刻那些琴键是一项乏味的任务，其他人也可以做，但安德鲁意识到，这是「做好」工作的一部分。不管这种事情是否无聊，他都会另眼相待，将其视为有价值的东西。枯燥乏味的工作体现了他为自己工作所负的责任，而这种责任是成为专家的一部分。

### 3.2 学习团队合作

Learning to work in a team

In this early stage in our apprenticeships, Joshua, Paul and I were working in someone else's territory, on their terms. We had little agency. It was the same after I qualified as a doctor and started to specialize. Early on I knew I wanted to become a surgeon, so I took every opportunity to be in the operating theatre. What I really wanted was to do operations myself, but instead I was only allowed to ‘assist'. This involved holding on to retractors to keep organs out of the way, so that the chief surgeon could get a good view.

I spent hours clutching the handle of a curved metal instrument whose other end was out of sight, being yelled at by the surgeon when I let it slip. I was at the bottom of the heap, and in a big operation with several assistants there were times when I couldn't see anything at all. Nobody gives a damn about the comfort of the third assistant, and I often ended up grappling with boredom and backache at the same time. I could see why American surgical residents described retractors as ‘idiot sticks', because even an idiot could hold one. It seemed a complete waste of time. Why couldn't someone else do it?

Having been the lead surgeon in countless operations since, I now realize how important it is for everyone to focus on their part. I know how exasperating it can be when a member of your team stops concentrating. You're about to clip and tie a bleeding artery, when a loop of intestine slips out from behind the retractor your assistant is supposed to be holding. The artery disappears from view and you have to start all over again. It's infuriating. For the bored assistant, it's just another example of them not yet understanding the bigger picture – of not recognizing the value of essential, albeit dull, work.

When I started my surgical training at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, I had to take my turn draining abscesses in the septic theatre. These were the cases more experienced surgeons didn't want to do. There's little glamour in pus, and I was left to carry out these smelly procedures on my own. Of course, I knew abscesses were horrible for the patients who had them, and I tried to do these procedures as well as I could, but at the time I didn't find them very interesting.

Later, I experienced something similar as a GP trainee. One of my jobs was to see the ‘extras' – the patients who turned up after the morning or evening session had finished and needed to be squeezed in. Mostly they had straightforward problems: children with earache, women wanting the morning-after pill, or people whose repeat prescription had run out. To me at the time, this part of the work seemed almost trivial. But it wasn't trivial at all, and I was learning far more than I realized. The starting point for any expert is to spend time – lots of time – in the world you'll be joining. You have to become familiar with the materials, tools and people who make up that world. It's often tedious and dispiriting, but unless you put in that time, you won't leave the starting blocks.

Of course, you don't start entirely from scratch when you become an Apprentice; the path to becoming expert begins way back, in early childhood. Long before I was studying anatomy, let alone doing the bloods on a hospital ward, I was gathering relevant knowledge and skills. At home and at primary school I learned how to read, to write and to make. I tried out lots of things and got them wrong. At secondary school the process continued: I absorbed more facts, I did more with my hands. I learned the rudiments of science, of what to do in a laboratory. And, like everyone else, I worked with people. I learned how to get along with the children in my class, including the ones I didn't like and who didn't like me. It's the same for all the experts in this book and any of you reading it. Joshua the tailor and Paul the stone carver had both been working with their hands for decades before they started their chosen careers, and they'd been working with other people.

In order to join any group, you have to earn your place. As we've seen, this usually starts off by doing the jobs that nobody else wants. Often, these tasks act as a rite of passage, an initiation. When you're learning martial arts in Japan, you start by cleaning the sensei's rice bowl. When you're making pocket flaps, or taking blood samples for the coming week's operating list, you're showing your willingness to be part of the work as a whole, not just cherry-picking the bits you find interesting.

When you start, you're at the bottom of the pile. You get the jobs nobody else wants. You can't see how your tasks fit with what other people are doing. The work is often irksome and you have to do what you're told. Nobody cares whether you like it or not, and you feel like a cog in a machine. When I started as a houseman, a doctor who had been in the team a year longer than I had took me to one side and explained how things worked. ‘It's simple really, Roger,' he said. ‘Shit flows downhill and you're at the bottom.'

在学徒阶段的早期，约书亚、保罗和我都在别人的领域里工作，按照他们的要求做事。我们几乎没有自己的能动性。在我取得医师资格并开始专攻某一领域之后，情况依然如此。我很早就知道自己想做一名外科医生，所以我抓住了每一个待在手术室里的机会。我真正想要的是自己做手术，但别人只允许我「协助」他们。这项任务包括握住牵开器，拨开碍事的器官，这样主刀的外科医生就能看清患者的情况了。

我要一连好几个小时握着一个弯曲金属器械的手柄，却看不见它的另一端在哪儿。我要是没拿稳，外科医生就会冲我大叫。我是最底层的工作者。在一场大型手术中有好几名助手，而我有时什么也看不见。没有人在乎第三助手舒不舒服，我经常在无聊和背痛中苦苦挣扎。我可以理解为什么美国的外科住院医生管牵开器叫「傻瓜棒」，因为即使傻瓜也能拿住它。这似乎完全是浪费时间。为什么不能让别人来做呢？

后来，作为无数次手术的主刀外科医生，我意识到了每个人专注于自己的任务有多么重要。我知道团队成员不能集中注意力有多么让人恼火。你正要夹住流血的动脉并打结，一节肠子却从你助手本应拿住的牵开器后面滑了出来。动脉从视野中消失了，你不得不重新来过。这会让人火冒三丈。对于百无聊赖的助手来说，这只是他们尚不理解大局的另一个例子 —— 他们没有认识到这种无聊但重要的工作的价值。

我在索韦托的巴拉瓜纳医院开始接受外科训练的时候，我必须在脓肿治疗室里给患者的脓肿引流。这些都是有经验的外科医生不愿意做的事情。脓液可不是什么有意思的东西，而我必须独自完成这些臭烘烘的事情。当然，我知道脓肿对于患者来说是可怕的，我会尽我所能地做好这些事情，但我觉得这没什么意思。

后来，我在做实习全科医生的时候也遇到了类似的事情。我的一项工作就是照看「临时患者」—— 那些在上午和晚间工作时间后来的患者，我们要为他们挤出时间。他们的问题大多很简单：耳朵疼的孩子，想要紧急避孕药的妇女，或者处方药吃完、需要拿药的人。对于当时的我来说，这部分工作似乎是微不足道的。但这根本不是微不足道的事情，我学到的东西比我意识到的多得多。任何专家的起点，都是花时间（许多时间）待在你即将加入的世界里。你必须熟悉构成这个世界的工作对象、工具和人员。这个过程通常既乏味又令人沮丧，但除非你投入时间，否则你不会离开起点。

当然，你在成为学徒的时候，不会完全从零开始；成为专家的旅程在童年早期就已经开始了。早在我学习解剖学之前（更早于在医院病房采血的时候），我就已经在收集相关的知识和技能了。我在家和小学里学会了读、写和手工。我尝试过许多东西，也犯过很多错误。到了中学，这个过程还在继续：我学习了更多的知识，用双手做了更多的事情。我学到了一些基本的科学知识，知道了在实验室里该做什么。就像其他人一样，我也会和别人合作。我学会了如何与班上的孩子相处，包括我不喜欢和不喜欢我的孩子。本书里的所有专家和阅读本书的所有读者都是如此。在从事自己选择的职业之前，裁缝约书亚和石匠保罗都用自己的双手工作了二三十年，而且他们也一直在和其他人一起工作。

为了加入任何团体，你必须赢得自己的位置。正如我们所见，这通常都始于做别人不想做的工作。这些任务通常就像是一种过渡仪式，一种入门仪式。你在日本学习武术时，首先要给师父洗碗。你在制作袋盖时，或者为下一周手术名单上的患者采集血液样本时，你就表明了你愿意投身于这份工作的全部，而不是挑肥拣瘦，只做你觉得有意思的部分。

在开始的时候，你要从最底层做起。你做的都是别人都不想做的工作。你看不出自己的任务与别人的工作有什么关系。

这些工作常常令人厌烦，别人叫你做什么你就得做什么。没有人在乎你喜不喜欢，你觉得自己就像机器上的一颗齿轮。我开始做实习医生的时候，有一个比我早来一年的医生把我叫到一边，向我解释那里的规矩。「罗杰，其实很简单，」他说，「屎往低处滚，而你就在最低处。」

shit flows downhill，俚语，指坏的结果由弱小的一方承担。—— 译者注

### 3.3 实践社群

Communities of practice

One important outcome of this frustrating work is that you get good at skills you'll need later on. Like it or not, you have to be able to take blood or make pocket flaps. But another aspect is that you join a community of practice.

The idea of communities of practice was developed by Jean Lave, a social anthropologist, and Etienne Wenger, a teacher with an interest in artificial intelligence. According to their thinking, we are all members of multiple communities. When we join a football club, change our job, learn a new skill or go into a different class at school, we are becoming part of a new community. Each community is made up of concentric circles, and we start on the periphery. But even when we're on the edge we are ‘legitimate participants' and we have the right to be there. We've joined the football club, so we're different to somebody who is thinking about joining the football club. But even though we've made a start, we can't do much yet. There's a lot to learn before we become a member of the team.

Learning on the job can be scary. Sometimes people show you what to do and how the system works, but often they don't. They just expect you to know. But how can you?

Soon after my experience with the bloods, I went into the operating theatre for the first time. A kindly houseman in the changing room showed me how to find scrubs and boots of about the right size, how to put on a cap and mask, and which theatre to go into. Feeling very professional, I went through the doors to where an operation was in full swing. Suddenly someone screamed ‘DON'T DO THAT!' and everyone turned to stare at me. I wanted to fall through a hole in the floor. To this day I've no idea what I did wrong. All I know is that I broke some rule I didn't even know existed.

So how can we make sense of something like that when it happens? As a newcomer, a lot of what goes on in a community seems incomprehensible. Gradually the newness wears off and we get to know people, we watch how things work, we find out how people ‘do things around here'. It's a slow process, but all that time we are learning from others in the group. The junior doctor who told me ‘shit flows downhill and you're at the bottom' was only slightly more experienced than me, but he had learned something I hadn't. He had become part of the community I was only starting to join. He had an insider's understanding of how it really worked, and he let me into a secret the books had never told me.

As you spend time in a community, you move towards its centre. Lave and Wenger's term for this is ‘legitimate peripheral participation'. It's a clunky phrase, but it captures the process of moving to and fro. They use it to speak ‘about the relations between newcomers and old-timers, and about activities, identities, artifacts, and communities of knowledge and practice'.

Communities have fluid boundaries, and relationships between colleagues shift and re-form. When I was taking blood and re-siting drips in the middle of the night, I was at the centre of a community of junior doctors. But when I presented the patients to my consultant on the ward round the next day, the landscape had shifted. She was at the centre and I had moved back towards the edge.

In any group, you gradually become more confident, moving steadily inwards. But whenever you join a new community of practice, you start all over again. Things which have become second nature as a central participant in one community may no longer hold when you are peripheral in another. This happened to me every time I moved up a stage in the surgical hierarchy, from being a houseman to a registrar, then from registrar to consultant. Every time you progress to another level, you have to do an equivalent of taking bloods or making pocket flaps. Whatever your area of interest, you'll have your own experience of moving across boundaries.

By doing time, Joshua the tailor, Paul the stone carver and I were each forming a bedrock of essential knowledge without realizing it. This knowledge isn't just theoretical. It's the knowledge of ‘doing': the physicality of materials and bodies. It doesn't come from books and you have to experience it for yourself, stocking an internal library of sensations, muscular actions and familiarity with your materials – especially when those materials are other people.

这项令人沮丧的工作能带来一个重要的结果，那就是你会熟练掌握你以后需要的技能。不管你喜不喜欢，你都必须掌握采血或制作袋盖的方法。另一个重要的结果是，你加入了一个实践社群。

实践社群的概念是由社会人类学家让·莱夫（Jean Lave）与教师艾蒂安·温格（Etienne Wenger）提出的，后者对人工智能很感兴趣。在他们看来，我们都是多个社群的成员。当我们加入足球俱乐部、换工作、学习新技能或在学校里进入另一个班级时，我们都会成为一个新社群的成员。每个社群都是由多个同心圆构成的，我们一开始位于最外围的圈上。即使我们处在边缘地带，我们也是「正当的参与者」，有权利待在那里。我们已经加入了足球俱乐部，所以我们与正在考虑加入的人不同。但是，即使我们已经加入了俱乐部，我们能做的还是很少。我们还有很多东西要学，然后才能成为队伍里的一员。

在工作中学习可能会让人害怕。他人有时会告诉你该做什么以及社群的运作方式，但他们常常不会这样做。他们只会认为你应该知道。但你怎么可能知道呢？

在我做采血工作之后不久，我就第一次走进了手术室。在更衣室里，一位好心的实习医生告诉我如何找到尺寸合适的外科手术服和手术鞋，如何戴上手术帽和口罩，以及该去哪间手术室。穿戴完毕，我感觉自己很专业，于是穿过大门，来到一间手术室：一场手术正进行到最紧张的时刻。突然有人大叫：「别这样做！」所有人都转过头来盯着我。我真想找个地缝钻进去。

时至今日我依然不知道我当时做错了什么。我只知道我违反了一条我根本不知道的规则。

那么，当这种事情发生时，我们该如何看待呢？对于一个新人来说，实践社群里有很多事似乎都是无法理解的。渐渐地，陌生感消失了，我们开始了解其他人，观察事物的运作方式，弄清了大家「在这儿是怎么做事的」。这是一个缓慢的过程，但我们一直在向群体中的其他人学习。那个告诉我「屎往低处滚，而你就在最低处」的实习医生，他的经验只比我多一点点，但他学到了一些我不了解的东西。他已经成了这个社群的一员，而我才刚刚加入。他对社群的真实运作方式了如指掌，他让我了解了一个书本从未告诉我的秘密。

你在一个社群里待上一段时间后，就会朝它的核心前进。莱夫和温格用这个术语来描述这个过程：合法的边缘性参与（legitimate peripheral participation）。虽然这是一个拗口的术语，但很好地描述了这种变化的过程。他们用这个术语来描述「与知识和实践相关的活动、身份认同、产物与社群」。

社群的边界会不断变化，成员间的关系会改变和重新建立。在半夜采血和放置静脉滴注套管的时候，我是社区医疗中心实习医生里的核心成员。但是，当我第二天在病房里向顾问医师介绍患者情况的时候，我的身份就发生了变化。她位于中心地位，而我退回了边缘。

在任何群体里，你都会逐渐增长自信，不断向内移动。但是，每当你加入一个新的实践社群，你都会重新开始。当你身处另一个社群的边缘时，有些对于原先社群的核心参与者来说再自然不过的事情，也都不再适用了。每当我在外科医生的职级中晋升的时候，这种事情就会发生 —— 从实习医生到住院医生，再从住院医生到顾问医师。每当你晋升到另一个级别，你都得做类似采血或制作袋盖的事情。无论你对哪个领域感兴趣，你都会有跨越边界的经历。

通过积累，裁缝约书亚、石匠保罗和我都在不知不觉间打下了重要的知识基础。这种知识不仅是理论知识。这是「做」的知识：是有关工作对象与身体的物理特性的知识。这种知识不是从书本上得来的，你必须自己去体验，在脑海中存储一系列感觉、肌肉动作以及对于工作对象的感知 —— 尤其是当这些对象是其他人的时候。

### 3.4 与他人一起工作

Working with people

Some experts spend most of their time with other people. Hairstylists are a good example. Fabrice Ringuet has over thirty years' experience as a stylist and a teacher. He has been director of training at the Toni & Guy Academy and now runs masterclasses. He has spent years distilling his knowledge and skills as he trains apprentice hairstylists. For Fabrice, like me, doing time started with the jobs no one else wanted, such as sweeping the floor between customers or making tea for the clients as they waited. It was boring, frustrating work which stopped him from doing what he really wanted – to cut, to style, to be creative.

Gradually, Fabrice began to work directly with customers. After doing menial tasks for a long time, he progressed to washing clients' hair. In the process, he learned what hair looked and felt like – long hair, short hair, straight and curly, old and young. At the same time, he learned about people, and about himself. He learned to overcome his shyness, gently massaging each client's scalp as he applied the shampoo.

But when he started washing hair, Fabrice would get things wrong. Like all trainee stylists, he'd sometimes get soap in a client's eyes. He had to apologize, put things right and retain their confidence in the salon. Like me with the bloods, Fabrice was relating to people. He studied how to approach clients as they were sitting in a chair and watching him in the mirror. He learned how to enter their personal space without making them feel uncomfortable. Eventually, though, he progressed to cutting a straight edge in long hair. Though it was a seemingly simple task, it pushed him to a new level, and once again he discovered how difficult his craft could be.

During those endless hours of sweeping up and shampooing, then cutting straight edges in long hair, Fabrice was laying the foundations of his later expertise. As he developed his skills, he was moving towards the centre of a community of practice. He would draw on this experience later in his career, when he took responsibility for teaching other stylists.

This kind of knowledge can't be rushed or short-circuited. You have to build it up through experience, and it sets its own pace. Like making a cake, you can't finish it in half the time by baking it at twice the temperature. Learning to ‘do' is not like cramming facts for an exam and forgetting it all a week later. The process takes time and has to ripen.

This bodily awareness is like a language learned through constant practice. How much pressure to apply, when to back off or take a break, and when to call for help – all these kinds of knowing evolve at their own speed and cannot be forced. Once mastered, however, the slow knowing pays dividends. Those cumbersome steps and unfamiliar movements become automatic, an unconscious part of what you do. Eventually, you stop thinking about component skills and focus instead on the outcome.

All of us learned our skills by doing tedious things again and again. Joshua's sewing needle became an extension of his hands, and in the end he didn't have to think about it. I could get blood from almost anyone with my syringe and needle, even when I was half asleep. Paul Jakeman could make a flat stone surface on autopilot, and Fabrice could cut someone's long hair in a straight line while chatting to them about their holiday. Eventually, we no longer relied on beginner's luck. We could make our materials do what we wanted every time. To get to that stage, though, we had to become comfortable with our materials.

To a non-specialist, it may seem that cloth is just cloth and stone is just stone. Human bodies, too, seem roughly similar. And at first glance you might think that hair is just hair. But this isn't the case at all. Cutting a straight line in two different types of long hair is a different physical experience.

It's the same with all materials. Every length of cloth, every piece of stone and every person is infinitely varied. It is impossible to learn a technique in the abstract. Skills only make sense in the context of that length of cloth, that piece of granite, that unique human being.

So far I've talked about the physical world. But ‘materials' don't have to be something you can touch or see. If you're working with words, with stocks and shares, or with computer code, you are engaging with the materials of your work. Learning to handle these intangibles takes just as much time as working with their physical counterparts. You still have to spend time grappling with the basics, then learning how to shape and mould them.

有些专家大部分时间里都在和他人一起工作。发型设计师就是一个很好的例子。法布里斯·兰盖（Fabrice Ringuet）拥有 30 多年发型设计与教学的经验。他是托尼盖美发学院（Toni＆Guy Academy）的培训总监，现在正在开办大师课程。他花了很多年时间培训见习发型师，在这个过程中提炼自己的知识和技能。法布里斯和我一样，都是从做没人愿意做的工作开始积累经验的，比如在顾客接受服务的间隙里扫地，或者在顾客等待的时候为他们沏茶。这份工作很枯燥、令人沮丧，让他不能做他真正想做的事情 —— 剪发、美发、创造。

渐渐地，法布里斯开始直接与客户打交道。干了很长一段时间卑微的工作之后，他开始给顾客洗头了。在这个过程中，他了解了头发的样子与质地 —— 长发、短发、直发、卷发、老人和年轻人的头发。与此同时，他了解了别人，也了解了自己。他学会了克服害羞的心理，一边涂洗发水，一边轻轻地按摩每一位顾客的头皮。

但是，在法布里斯开始洗头时，他常常犯错。就像所有的见习发型师一样，他有时会把洗发水弄到顾客的眼睛里。他不得不道歉，纠正错误，让顾客保持对美发店的信心。就像我在采血时一样，法布里斯也开始了解他人了。他学会了如何与坐在椅子上、打量镜中自己的顾客打交道。他学会了如何进入顾客的个人空间而不让他们感觉不舒服。渐渐地，他开始学着给长发修剪直边。虽然这是一项看似简单的任务，但法布里斯有了新的理解。他再次发现自己所学的手艺是多么复杂。

在无数个小时的扫地、洗头、给长发剪直边的过程中，法布里斯为他后来的专长打下了基础。随着技能的发展，他逐渐走向了实践社群的中心。在职业生涯后期，负责教授其他发型设计师的时候，他会用上这些经验。

这种知识的学习不能操之过急，也没有捷径可走。你必须有经验的积累，遵循这个过程固有的节奏。这就像做蛋糕一样，即使你用两倍的温度来烤，也无法把烤制的时间缩短一半。学「做事」不同于为了考试死记硬背，而一周后就把知识全都忘了。这个过程需要时间，需要逐渐发展到瓜熟蒂落的时刻。

形成这种身体的意识，就像通过不断练习来学习语言。该给自己多大的压力，何时退后或休息，何时寻求帮助 —— 所有这些知识都会按照自身的速度积累，不能揠苗助长。然而，一旦掌握了这些缓慢发展的知识就会有回报。那些笨拙的操作步骤和不熟悉的动作会变成自动化、无意识的，成为你行为方式的一部分。最后，你不会再考虑这些不同方面的技能，而会关注结果。

我们所有人都是通过一次又一次地做乏味的事情来学习技能的。约书亚的缝衣针成了他双手的延伸，最后他根本不必再留意它。有了注射器和针头，我几乎可以从任何人身上采血，即使是在半睡半醒的时候。保罗·杰克曼可以在不思考的情况下雕刻出平坦的石头表面，而法布里斯可以一边和别人聊他们的假期见闻，一边给他们的长发剪出直边。最终，我们都不用再依赖初学者的运气。我们可以随时让我们的工作对象呈现出我们想要的样子。然而，为了达到这个阶段，我们必须对这些东西了如指掌。

对于非专业人士而言，可能布就是布，石就是石。人体似乎也大同小异。乍一看，你可能以为头发只是头发，但实际上没有这么简单。给两种不同的长发剪直边，是两种不同的身体体验。

对于所有的工作对象都是如此。每一匹布、每一块石头、每一个人都有着无限的变化。我们无法用抽象的形式学习一种技术。只有面对那匹布、那块花岗岩、那个独一无二的人的时候，技能才有意义。

到目前为止，我讨论的是物质的世界。但是「工作对象」不一定是你可以触摸或看见的东西。如果你在与文字、股票与证券，或计算机代码打交道，那你也是在接触自己的工作对象。

学习处理这些无形的东西所需的时间，与那些有形的事物是一样的。你依然需要花时间掌握基本知识，然后学习如何改变和塑造这些知识。

### 3.5 减少意外

Minimizing surprise

Certainly the skills which Joshua and I and the others mastered are useful in their own right. Jackets need pocket flaps and patients need blood taken. These tasks may not be interesting to the person doing them, but they have to be done. But there's more. By doing that repetitive work, we not only spent time with our materials and our tools, we became part of multiple systems. The first is the community of practice I described earlier. The second is the physical system by which any workplace is structured and set out, which I'll examine in the next chapter. The third is the internal system within our heads which we populate by repetition. This can be explained by a neuroscientific concept called ‘predictive coding'.

The idea here is that the brain's job is not to absorb and process everything. Instead, it is meant to minimize surprise. The more you've experienced, the less surprised you'll be. This is particularly true of things that look roughly the same. For instance, each piece of cloth you work with might be different, but making a pocket flap to a specification minimizes variation. That makes life easier. As I got the hang of the bloods, I started to recognize patterns – to spot which veins were like clay pipe stems, and which ones would burst into huge bruises at the touch of a needle. I became aware of a landscape of common variations, and I adapted my technique accordingly. Like a beginner at chess or bridge, I came to realize that the number of common opening gambits is relatively small. Once I knew them, I could often see trouble coming before it arrived. That's predictive coding.

As we develop, our brains assemble a series of ‘probability priors' – predictions of what is likely to happen next. If the outcomes happen as anticipated, the brain doesn't do much. It just recognizes that things are as it expected. But if the anticipated outcomes don't happen, the brain registers surprise and takes appropriate action. Our prior knowledge sets hypotheses and tells us what's likely to happen. Our senses provide confirming or disconfirming evidence.

The difference between experts and non-experts in a field is that the experts have built up a rich set of expectations based on their previous experience, so they can ‘sample for difference'. That stops them having to waste energy in processing everything they encounter. Non-experts, on the other hand, have to start from scratch, analysing and interpreting information from all their senses.

This helps to explain the value of doing time – the gradual exposure to a range of experiences and sensory impressions that prime the brain with a knowledge of what to expect. That kind of knowing takes a long time to gain, but once embedded it is seldom lost. The traditional example is riding a bicycle. Those early experiences of interacting with the physical world – balance, coordination, the sensation of gravity – allow us to get on an unfamiliar bicycle years after we first learned, and ride without falling off. Even when verbal memory unravels, this physical memory often persists. And it applies to the world of surgery too.

I discovered this a couple of years ago when I was talking to Mrs Florence Thomas. When we met, she was ninety-seven and had just gone into a nursing home. I was doing some research into the history of surgical operations in the twentieth century, and I was keen to talk to Florence because I knew she had been a senior scrub nurse in a London teaching hospital during the Second World War. I wanted to ask her what that was like.

Florence had helped to run the operating theatres during the Blitz. Later in the war, she met a serviceman and they decided to get married. At that time, nursing was for unmarried women only. You could be a nurse or you could be married, but not both. So Florence left her profession, married the serviceman, had a family and never had anything more to do with healthcare. When I met her some seventy years later, her memory was very poor. She had difficulty recollecting anything about those days, or putting her experiences into words. At first I thought we weren't going to have much of a conversation.

By chance, though, I had a surgical instrument in my briefcase and I gave it to her. Turning it over in her hands, she began moving its tip in a circle as if putting in a suture. Then, to my astonishment, she told me its technical name. ‘These were called artery forceps, as far as I remember,' she said. When I asked her how she would pass that instrument to a surgeon, she turned it round and slapped the handle down in the unmistakeable manner of an experienced theatre nurse. Even when her words had failed, her body still remembered. The feel of that instrument reactivated her physical memory.

当然，约书亚、我，以及其他人掌握的技能有其自身的价值。西装上衣需要袋盖，患者需要采血。这些事情对于做事的人来说可能不太有趣，但必须有人来做。不仅如此，通过这些重复劳动，我们不仅把时间花在了工作对象和工具上，我们还成了多个系统的一部分。第一个系统就是我前面所说的实践社群。第二个系统是构成工作场所的物理系统，我会在下一章中探讨这个系统。第三个系统是我们头脑中的内部系统，我们会通过重复劳动丰富其中的内容。神经科学中有一个概念叫「预测性编码」（predictive coding），可以解释这种过程。

这个概念的大意是指，大脑的任务不是吸收和加工所有的信息，而是尽量减少意外的发生。你的经历越多，意外越少。对于那些看起来差不多的东西来说尤其如此。例如，你使用的每一块布料可能都是不同的，但根据规格制作袋盖可以最大限度地减少差异性。这样会减少很多麻烦。在熟练采血之后，我就能发现规律 —— 哪些血管像陶土烟杆，哪些血管会在针头的触碰下破裂，产生大片淤青。我了解了一些常见的可能性，于是相应地调整了我的技巧。就像国际象棋或桥牌的初学者一样，我意识到常见的开局方式是相对较少的。一旦了解了这些情况，我就往往能事先预见麻烦。这就是预测性编码。

在我们进步的过程中，我们的大脑会收集一系列「先验概率」，即对接下来可能会发生什么的预测。如果结果正如预期的那样，大脑就不会做太多事情。它只会确认事情正如它所料。

但是，如果预期的结果没有发生，大脑就会感到惊讶，并采取适当的行动。我们的先验知识持有一些假设，并告诉我们可能会发生什么。我们的感官会提供证实或证伪的证据。

一个领域的专家与非专家的区别在于，专家已经根据先前的经验，建立了一系列丰富的预期，所以他们能根据自己的「样本」来寻找差异。这就使他们不会在遇到所有事情时浪费精力去思考。然而，非专家必须从零开始，分析并解读他们所有感官收集到的信息。

这有助于解释积累的价值 —— 让我们逐渐地暴露于一系列体验与感觉印象里，让大脑熟悉即将发生的事情。这种知识需要很长时间才能获得，可一旦掌握，就很少会失去。最经典的例子就是骑自行车。这种与物质世界互动的早期经历 —— 平衡、协调，以及重力带给我们的感觉，能让我们在首次学会骑车的多年以后，再次骑上一辆不熟悉的自行车时也不会摔下来。即使言语记忆消失了，这种身体记忆往往也会留存下来。这种道理也适用于外科领域。

几年前我在与弗洛伦丝·托马斯夫人（Mrs Florence Thomas）谈话时发现了这一点。我们见面的时候，她已经 97 岁了，刚刚住进了养老院。我当时在做一些关于 20 世纪外科手术历史的研究，我很想和弗洛伦丝谈谈，因为我知道在第二次世界大战期间，她是伦敦的一所教学医院里的资深洗手护士。我想问问她当时的情况。

弗洛伦丝曾在闪电战期间协助主持手术室的工作。在战争后期，她遇见了一名军人，他们决定结婚。当时，只有未婚女性才能做护士。你可以做护士，也可以结婚，但不能两全。于是弗洛伦丝离开了工作岗位，嫁给了这名军人，组建了家庭，再也没有和医疗卫生领域有任何关系。在大约 70 年后，当我见到她的时候，她的记性已经很差了。她很难回忆起当时的任何事情，也无法用语言讲述自己的经历。起初我以为我们不会有太多可谈的东西。

不过，我的公文包里碰巧有一件手术器械，我把器械给了她。她把这件器械拿在手里把玩，开始用它的尖端绕圈，就好像在缝合一样。接着，让我感到惊讶的是，她说出了这件器械的专业名称。「我记得这叫动脉钳。」她说。我问她该怎么把这件器械递给外科医生，她把动脉钳转过来，把它的把手向下拍在我手上，这毫无疑问是一个经验丰富的手术室护士的手法。

即使说话已经很难了，但她的身体依然记得。那件器械的触感重新激活了她的身体记忆。

### 3.6 专长的模型

Models of expertise

So how do people become expert? A lot has been written on the subject and many researchers have come up with conceptual models. A well-known one maps out four stages. It looks like this:

Unconscious incompetence is when you don't even know you can't do it.

Conscious incompetence is when you're painfully aware that you aren't much good.

Conscious competence is where you can do it if you concentrate, but you have to think about what you're doing.

Unconscious competence is the final stage, the effortless mastery of the true expert.

This makes sense when you think about learning to drive. You move from those initial lessons – when you can't coordinate the clutch with the gear lever, or turn the wheel and look in the mirror at the same time – to when you arrive home after a two-hour journey whose details you can't remember, because you were absorbed in a conversation with your passenger. The doing has become automatic, and the driving looks after itself. But how?

An influential figure in researching expertise is K. Anders Ericsson, whose lifelong work has become popularized by other writers such as Malcolm Gladwell. For decades, Ericsson has been studying ‘elite performers' in music, chess and other fields, trying to work out their secret. His research shows that all successful experts have put in at least ten years – or ten thousand hours – of practice. This magic figure has even become a mantra, enshrined in popular culture. But Ericsson's work is often misinterpreted as suggesting that anyone who has put in that amount of practice will inevitably become an expert. In fact, Ericsson is saying that nobody becomes an expert without having done their time – not that putting in ten thousand hours will guarantee success. There's more to becoming expert than just practice. If Joshua hadn't spent all that time making pocket flaps, he wouldn't be the master tailor he is today. But if he hadn't made sure to build on that skill and develop further, he would just be good at making pocket flaps. Now his work has gone far beyond the technical proficiency that repetition brings.

One of Ericsson's insights has been into the nature of practice. Many people reach what he calls a ‘stable performance asymptote' – good enough to do what they want, but without pushing themselves to become exceptional. This applies to anyone learning club-level tennis, for example, or driving a car. But if you want to become an expert, Ericsson says, it's no good just doing the same thing over and over again. Practice must be sustained, deliberate, supported by expert feedback, and carried out with the intention to improve. Otherwise it's just a job or a recreation.

Other writers see things differently. I especially like the concept of routine and adaptive expertise, developed by the educational researchers Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia. Routine expertise is when you learn to do something in a particular way, then do it that way each time. For repetitive tasks like taking blood, making pocket flaps or creating harpsichord keyboards, this works well. You don't want to invent a new technique every time you do a simple task, or spend unnecessary brainpower on repetitive work. Instead you become good at doing things in a specific way and can hand that task over to your internal autopilot. In the example of learning to drive, this is effective for dealing with predictable situations. The difficulty comes when something unexpected arises, because then you need to think differently. As the psychologist Abraham Maslow is credited with observing, ‘it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail'. You interpret new problems in the light of pre-existing solutions. And that can lead to bad decisions.

Adaptive expertise, on the other hand, is about being able to come up with new approaches. People who develop adaptive expertise deliberately seek new challenges, putting themselves into uncomfortable positions that force them to think afresh. Becoming good at something that used to require effort frees up your mind, and adaptive experts use this spare capacity to improve their skills. Bereiter and Scardamalia describe this as ‘reinvesting freed-up attentional resources into progressive problem-solving'.

Returning to the driving example, instead of using that extra attentional capacity to talk with their passenger or listen to the radio, an adaptive expert might invest it in developing advanced driving techniques – reading the road more skilfully, driving in the fog, or practising in skid pans. I think we all have the capacity to develop both kinds of expertise, and to switch between routine and adaptive modes. When we do, the results can be life-changing. Or in Juan Manuel Fangio's case, life-saving.

It was 1950, and Fangio – one of the world's best racing drivers – was taking part in the Monaco Grand Prix. When a multi-car pile-up happened early in the race, Fangio was in the lead, one lap ahead and driving at top speed. The crash site was ahead of him but out of view, beyond the next corner. A fatal smash seemed inevitable. But instead of careering into the pile-up, Fangio suddenly slowed down and stopped just before he reached the wreckage. Asked about it later, he explained that in preparing for the race he had been looking at a photograph of a similar accident in 1936. When he came out of the chicane towards the pile-up, he was aware that the crowd looked somehow different – a different colour. He realized that they weren't looking at him but were facing in the other direction, and he was seeing the backs of their heads. Something ahead of him was interesting the crowd more than seeing Fangio coming towards them. He remembered seeing something similar in the photograph, braked hard, and stopped just short of the crash.

This must all have happened in a fraction of a second, when most drivers would have been using all their attentional resource to stay on the track at such blistering speed. But in that moment, Fangio was able to notice that something was wrong, process that information, and make sense of what he saw – all with time to do something about it. Afterwards, the laconic Fangio just said: ‘I was lucky.' But to me that isn't luck, it's adaptive expertise.

All this raises questions about the importance of doing time, and the experience of people like Joshua, Fabrice or me when we were starting out in our careers. From our perspective, we were just doing what we had to do, not engaging in sustained deliberate practice with the specific intention to improve, as Ericsson puts it. Our work was dictated by the environment we were in and the expectations of the people we were with. Nobody cared about our feelings or what we were learning. Yet whether we were aware of it or not, prolonged immersion in the work we had chosen allowed us to stock up an internal library of ‘doing' – a store of bodily knowledge that no amount of book-learning could have provided.

In the case of clinical medicine, book knowledge and ‘doing' are often out of sync. When I teach medical students how to take blood or suture a wound, they are often astonished at how troublesome they find it. High achievers throughout school and university, they are accustomed to mastering new knowledge without difficulty. But then they encounter these apparently simple physical tasks that lie outside their experience. That makes them feel like a five-year-old struggling to tie their shoelaces, and it comes as a shock. Unlike Joshua the tailor or Paul the stone carver, these students have not been working with materials and tools since day one. They lack the confidence that comes through continual exposure.

Knowing that it will take a long time to grasp such skills is helpful when we come to learn something new. It shows that doing time can't be bypassed. It shows that some skills can be unexpectedly elusive, taking much longer to master than you expect. And it shows why you sometimes get stuck.

那么，人是如何成为专家的呢？关于这个主题已经有了很多文献，许多研究者也提出了概念模型。有一个著名的模型描绘了四个阶段。该模型提出：

1、无意识的无能（unconscious incompetence）是指你连自己做不到某件事都不知道。

2、有意识的无能（conscious incompetence）是指你痛苦地意识到自己不太擅长这件事。

3、有意识的胜任（conscious competence）是指你集中精力就能做到这件事，但你必须想着自己正在做的事情。

4、无意识的胜任（unconscious competence）是最终阶段，即真正的专家达到了毫不费力的精通水准。

想一想学开车的经历，你就能理解这个模型了。你已经超越了初学开车的水平 —— 那时你不能协调地控制离合器与变速杆，不能一边打方向盘一边看后视镜；而现在，两个小时的车程之后，你回到家中时已记不起开车的具体细节，因为你一直在与乘客交谈。「驾驶」已经自动化了，成了自然而然的事情。

可这是怎么做到的呢？

K. 安德斯·埃里克森（K.Anders Ericsson）在专长的研究领域里很有影响力。如马尔科姆·格拉德威尔（MalcolmGladwell）这样的作者普及了埃里克森的毕生研究成果。几十年来，埃里克森一直在研究音乐、国际象棋和其他领域的「精英」，试图找出他们的秘诀。他的研究表明，所有成功的专家都在练习上至少投入了 10 年时间，或 1 万小时。这个神奇的数字已经成了至理名言，被流行文化奉为圭臬。但是，埃里克森的研究经常受到这样的误解：好像只要投入了这么多练习的时间，任何人都一定会成为专家。事实上，埃里克森的意思是，如果不做这样的积累，就没有人能成为专家 —— 并不是说投入 1 万小时就能保证成功。要成为专家，光靠练习是不够的。如果约书亚没有花那么多时间做袋盖，他就不会成为今天的裁缝大师。但是，如果他没有在这一技能的基础上继续进步，他只会擅长制作袋盖。现在他的工作已经远远超越了重复劳动所带来的技术熟练度。

埃里克森对练习的本质有着深刻的见解。许多人达到了他所说的「稳定表现渐近线」（stable performance asymptote）—— 水平高到足以做到他们想做的事，但不足以推动自己变得与众不同。这就好比任何网球达到业余水准的人，或者会开车的人。但是，埃里克森说，如果你想成为专家，只是重复做同样的事情是没有好处的。练习必须是持续的、刻意的，要有专家给予反馈，还要有改进的意愿。否则，你做的事情就只是一种任务或消遣。

还有些作者有不同的看法。我特别喜欢教育研究者卡尔·贝赖特（Carl Bereiter）和马琳·斯卡达玛利亚（MarleneScardamalia）提出的常规专长（routine expertise）和适应性专长（adaptive expertise）的概念。常规专长是指你学会了一种特定的做事方式，然后每次都按这种方式去做。对于重复的任务来说，如采血、制作袋盖或制作羽管键琴的琴键，这种专长很有用。你不希望每做一项简单的任务就发明一种新技术，或者在重复劳动上花费不必要的脑力。相反，你会擅长以一种特定的方式来做事，并将这项任务交给你的内部自动化系统来做。以学习开车为例，常规专长对于处理可预见的情况是很有效的。如果发生了意想不到的事情，困难就来了，因为这时你需要用另一种方式来思考。据说，心理学家亚伯拉罕·马斯洛（Abraham Maslow）曾说过：「如果锤子是你唯一的工具，你就很容易把所有东西都当作钉子。」你会根据已有的解决方案来看待新的问题。这可能会让你做出糟糕的决定。

与此不同，适应性专长是指提出新方法的能力。拥有适应性专长的人会刻意寻求新的挑战，把自己置于不舒服的境地，迫使自己用新的方式思考。一旦你变得擅长做某件曾经需要努力的事情，就能解放自己的头脑，而具有适应性的专家会利用这种解放出来的头脑来提高自己的技能。贝赖特和斯卡达玛利亚将这种行为称作「将腾出的注意力资源重新投入到高级的问题解决上去」。

回到开车的例子上，一个具有适应性的专家可能会把额外的注意力用于改进驾驶技术，如更好地观察路况、在雾天开车或在侧滑训练场练习安全驾驶，而不是与乘客交谈或听收音机。

我认为我们所有人都能发展常规专长和适应性专长，并在这两种专长之间切换。如果我们能做到这一点，结果可能会改变我们的人生。或者，在胡安·曼努纽尔·方吉奥（Juan Manuel Fangio）的例子里，能拯救生命。

1950 年，世界上出类拔萃的赛车手方吉奥参加了摩纳哥大奖赛。在比赛开始时，发生了连环相撞事故，此时方吉奥正领先一圈，以最高速度行驶。事故地点就在他的前方，但不在视线范围之内，就在下一个弯道后面。他似乎逃不过致命的车祸了。但是，方吉奥没有冲进相撞的赛车中间，他突然减慢了速度，在撞上车祸残骸之前停了下来。后来被问及此事时，他解释说，在准备比赛时，他一直在看一张 1936 年类似事故的照片。在驶出双急转弯，冲向车祸地点时，他意识到人群看起来有些异样 —— 颜色不一样了。他意识到观众不是在看他，而是面向另一个方向，他看到的是他们的后脑勺。与看见自己朝他们冲来相比，观众对他前方的某些东西更感兴趣。他记得在那张照片里看到了类似的现象，于是猛踩刹车，在快要撞上的时候停了下来。

这一切肯定都发生在几分之一秒内，而在如此惊人的速度下，大多数车手都会把所有的注意力资源放在使赛车待在赛道上。但在那一刻，方吉奥能够注意到有些不对劲，加工了这些信息，理解了看到的现象 —— 还有时间对此做出反应。事后，少言寡语的方吉奥只说了一句：「我很幸运。」但在我看来，这不是运气，而是适应性专长。

上述所有内容提出了一个问题：积累有多重要？像约书亚、法布里斯或我这样的人在职业生涯初期的经历有多重要？从我们的角度来看，我们只是在做必须做的事情，而不是像埃里克森所说，为了提高自己而进行持续的、刻意的练习。我们的工作是由我们所处的环境和身边的人的期望所决定的。没有人在乎我们的感受，或我们学到了什么。然而，不管我们是否意识到了这一点，长时间沉浸在我们所选择的工作中，让我们在脑海中积累了大量「做」的经验 —— 大量书本无法提供的身体知识。

就临床医学而言，书本知识与「做」往往是不同步的。在我教授医学生如何采血或缝合伤口时，他们常常惊讶地发现这有多么困难。他们在上学期间的成绩很优秀，习惯于毫不费力地掌握新知识。但他们随后会遇到这些看似简单的操作任务，而这些任务却超出了他们的经验范围。他们感觉自己像是在努力系鞋带的五岁孩子，这让他们很震惊。与裁缝约书亚或石匠保罗不同，这些学生从学习的第一天起就没有接触过工作对象与工具。他们缺乏通过持续的接触而产生的信心。

在我们开始学习新东西时，知道掌握这些技能要花很长时间是很有帮助的。这说明积累是不可回避的；有些技能可能出乎意料地难以掌握，需要花上比你预期更长的时间。这也说明为什么你有时会陷入困境。

### 3.7 改进的意愿

The intention to improve

When I was a GP, I learned to juggle. For several months, I went to lessons in a civic hall near my practice. Adrian, the teacher, was an inspiration. Tall, gangly and covered in tattoos, Adrian was one of the best performers in the UK, known at juggling conventions across the country for his superstar command of seven- and nine-ball patterns.

I started juggling with three balls. Learning this most basic of forms takes most people a few hours. Each ball goes from one hand to the other in what's supposed to be a graceful arc. It's frustrating at first, and you spend most of your time picking up balls. Eventually you get the hang of throwing one ball before you catch the previous one, and you develop a rhythm that becomes automatic. There are lots of variations which take ages to master, but the underlying idea is straightforward enough. I did a lot of practising, and soon I was able to keep a pattern going for as long as I wanted.

Naturally I wanted to move on, to develop my skills further. Four balls seemed the obvious next step, but juggling even numbers of balls is quite different from odd numbers. Instead of tossing each ball from one hand to the other, four-ball juggling consists of two independent patterns – one for each hand. When you throw two balls round in a circle with each hand at speed, it looks as if all four balls are crossing. In fact, they never do. I found this tricky, but after a few months I became able to do this too.

The crunch came with five balls. Because this is another odd-number pattern, each ball moves from hand to hand. It doesn't sound much more difficult than juggling three balls, but it is – by an order of magnitude. For a start, you have to be far more accurate in throwing and catching. You also have to throw all the balls high into the air in rapid succession, then start catching and throwing them again. I just couldn't do it. I practised for months and months, and to this day I've never cracked it. Even Adrian, who could juggle five balls in his sleep, didn't seem able to help. He tried approach after approach but I just couldn't get it. I was stuck at a threshold I couldn't cross, a barrier I couldn't push through.

Repetition is essential in any field, as we've seen. Doing time is necessary in order to progress, but on its own it's not enough – it's all too easy to tread water without moving forward. Once you've got the hang of an aspect of your work, whether taking blood, making pocket flaps or anything else, you have to push through an invisible barrier to reach the next level. This is what Ericsson means by sustained deliberate practice with the intention to improve .

Each time you come up against one of these invisible barriers and get through it, you move a little further along the path to becoming expert. Whenever that happens, you quickly focus on the new challenge and forget how hard you worked to get there. If it doesn't happen, you remain stuck, like me trying to juggle five balls.

If I'd wanted to become a professional like Adrian, I'd have found a way to push through that barrier. But for me, juggling was relaxation, not a career. Once I'd gained a reasonable proficiency, I never worked hard enough to move on to the next stage. I had reached Ericsson's ‘stable performance asymptote' and stayed there.

My work in medicine was different, however. Even though I found taking blood difficult, I was determined to keep going and master it. I kept practising, and in the end I got there.

在做全科医生的时候，我学会了杂耍。几个月来，我一直前往离我诊所不远的一个市民活动中心上课。那里的老师阿德里安很擅长激发大家的奇思妙想。阿德里安又高又瘦，身上满是文身。他是英国最好的杂耍艺人之一，曾在全国杂耍大会上大放异彩，轻而易举地完成了七球和九球模式的表演。

开始学习杂耍的时候，我是从三个球开始的。大多数人花几个小时就能学会这种最基本的技巧。每个球都要从一只手传递到另一只手，形成一个完美的弧线。刚开始时你会很沮丧，因为大部分时间都会用来捡球。渐渐地，你会掌握其中的诀窍，在接住球之前扔出另一个球，你会找到一种自动化的节奏。杂耍中有许多变化，需要花上很长时间才能掌握，但其基本概念却很简单。我做了大量练习，很快就能随心所欲地耍起来了。

当然，我想继续进步，进一步发展我的技能。很显然，下一步似乎该学四球模式了，但在杂耍中，奇数与偶数有很大的不同。不同于将每个球从一只手抛到另一只手上，四球杂耍由两种独立的模式组成 —— 每只手各有一种模式。当你用双手快速地把两个球绕圈抛起来的时候，四个球看起来好像在交错飞行。事实上，它们根本没有交叉。我觉得这很难，但在几个月后，我也学会了这套把戏。

真正的困难是五球模式。由于这是另一种奇数模式，每个球要从一只手移动到另一只手。听起来并不比抛接三个球难多少，但这其实更难 —— 难得多。首先，你在抛球和接球时必须更准确。你还必须把所有球连续、快速地高高抛起，然后接住并再次抛起。我就是学不会。我练习了好几个月，直到今天也没有成功。即使是阿德里安，这个能在睡梦中抛接五个球的人似乎也帮不了我。他试了一个又一个方法，但我就是学不会。我被一个无法跨越的门槛拦住了，这是一个我无法突破的障碍。

我们已经看到了，重复在任何领域都是必不可少的。为了进步，积累是必要的，但仅靠积累是不够的 —— 就像在游泳一样，我们很容易徒劳地踩水，却不能向前移动。一旦你掌握了工作的某一方面，无论是采血、制作袋盖还是其他事情，你都必须突破无形的障碍，才能达到下一个层次。这就是埃里克森所说的「持续、刻意的练习，再加上改进的意愿」。

每当你遇到这些无形的障碍并克服它们时，你就会在成为专家的路上走得更远。每当这种情况发生时，你很快就会把注意力集中在新的挑战上，忘记自己为达到目前的水平付出过多少努力。如果没有发生这种情况，你就会被困在原地，就像我试图抛接五个球一样。

如果我想成为阿德里安那样的专业人士，我就会找到突破障碍的方法。但对我来说，杂耍是放松，而不是职业。我达到一定程度的熟练水平以后，就没有再付出足够的努力，让自己达到下一个阶段了。我已经达到了埃里克森所说的「稳定表现渐近线」，并一直停留在那里。

然而，我在医学领域的工作却是不同的。尽管我觉得采血很难，但我还是决心继续努力并掌握这种技能。我坚持练习，最后达成了目标。

### 3.8 达成目标

Getting there

Back to Manchester in 1974. I'm struggling to put in an intravenous cannula and set up a drip on my emergency patient and I'm scared stiff. But that day I'm lucky. An experienced nurse helps me assemble the giving set and run through some fluid. My patient has veins that even a novice could find, and I strike gold at my first attempt. Blood flashes back, I slide the cannula into the patient's vein and the nurse helps me connect the tubing. ‘Thank you, Doctor,' the patient says gratefully. Being called ‘Doctor' when I'm just a student makes me feel proud, though also like an imposter.

Even my limited experience doing the bloods had allowed me to perform a different procedure on my first go, at short notice and in an emergency. That's what repetition makes possible. But whatever your area of activity, there's no shortcut to doing time. You can't cheat the clock. Knowing this can be helpful, because if you're slow it doesn't mean you're stupid. It's just that the skills of ‘doing' have different rules, and the kind of knowing that is required develops at a different speed from the knowledge of facts or figures. Remember, during those dark, dispiriting times when you seem to be standing still, that stuff is going on inside which will eventually come to fruition. You just have to keep going.

One afternoon over tea, I told an experienced doctor on my team how difficult I'd found my first round of doing the bloods. She looked at me blankly. She could no longer understand what it was like to flounder around with such an apparently simple task – simple, that is, to her. By then she had taken blood so often that it was second nature. She had made a transition and couldn't see the gulf I was facing. Some time later, the same thing started happening to me.

I got the hang of the bloods. I worked out a system for keeping track of my specimen bottles, lab forms, syringes and needles. I could put up drips and manage the kit. I was gaining confidence in approaching patients I'd never met, and I was coming to terms with causing a necessary discomfort. I'd begun to join a community of practice. I was even able to help a junior student myself, giving them tips about how to do what I'd once found so difficult. Already those difficulties were starting to blur and fade. I couldn't put myself back in their position because I'd moved forward. I'd taken a step along the journey to becoming expert.

I learned something else from doing the bloods, something even more important which I didn't notice at the time. While I was concentrating on getting round all those patients to take their blood before the lab closed, I wasn't only learning marksmanship with a syringe needle; I was learning to talk to people and to listen, to gain their trust and get them to let me into their personal space. I was learning to steel myself so I could carry on, even when I was causing pain and I knew that someone more experienced could have done it better. I was learning to relate to patients, to navigate the space between myself and another person – someone who was anxious, uncertain and vulnerable. In a nutshell, I was learning to become a doctor.

Becoming a doctor, a tailor or a hairstylist involves more than just learning skills. You have to start thinking like a doctor or a tailor or a hairstylist, and not just doing the things those people do. Something was changing inside me. When somebody called me ‘Doctor', I didn't feel sheepish. I turned around and asked, ‘How can I help?'

回到 1974 年的曼彻斯特。我正在艰难地给急诊患者插静脉滴注套管，吓得浑身僵硬。不过那一天我很幸运。一位经验丰富的护士帮助我安装好了整套设备，生理盐水流过了套管。这位患者的静脉即便是新手都能找到，我第一次尝试就成功了。

套管内有回血了，我将套管针插入了患者的静脉，护士帮我连接好了导管。「谢谢你，医生。」患者感激地说。对于还是学生的我来说，被称作「医生」让我感到自豪，但我同时觉得自己像个冒牌货。

虽然我有一些极为有限的采血经验，但我还是能在第一次尝试时就完成一套不同的操作，而且还是在紧急的、刚刚接到通知的情况下。这都是重复的功劳。无论在什么领域，积累的过程都是没有捷径的。你不能投机取巧。知道这一点很有帮助，因为学得慢并不意味着你很笨。这只是因为各种「做」的技巧有不同的规则，所需要的知识（无论是客观事实还是数据）的增长速度不同。记住，在那些最黑暗、最沮丧的时刻，当你似乎停滞不前的时候，内在的积累过程终有开花结果的一天。你只需要继续前进。

一天下午，我一边喝茶，一边告诉团队里的一个经验丰富的医生，我觉得第一次采血有多么困难。她茫然地看着我。她已经不理解为这种看似简单的任务手忙脚乱是什么感觉了 —— 准确地说，这种任务对她来说是简单的。那时，她已经做过无数次采血了，这已经成了她信手拈来的事情。她经历了一种转变，看不到我面临的鸿沟了。一段时间以后，同样的事情也开始发生在我身上。

我知道怎么采血了。我想出了一套方法来记住我的样本瓶、实验室表格、注射器和针头分别在哪儿。我能够完成输液和管理工具箱了。在接触从未见过的患者时，我越来越有自信，并且接受了我要给他们带来必要的不适感这件事。我开始加入实践社群了。我甚至能帮助没有经验的学生，告诉他们怎么做那些我曾经觉得很难的事。那些困难对我来说已经开始变得模糊起来，并逐渐消失了。我已经不能让自己回到他们的处境里了，因为我已经进步了。我在成为专家的旅程上向前迈进了一步。我从采血中还学到了一些别的东西，一些更重要的东西，尽管我当时没有意识到。我全神贯注地在患者之间奔忙，赶在实验室关闭前完成所有采血任务的时候，我不仅练就了用注射器扎针的准头，还学会了如何与人交谈，如何倾听，如何赢得他们的信任，让他们允许我进入他们的个人空间。即使我给他们造成了痛苦，即使我知道更有经验的人可能会做得更好，我也会鼓起勇气，坚定信念，这样我才能坚持下去。我学到了如何与患者相处，如何拿捏自己与对方之间的距离 —— 对面的这个人感到很焦虑、不确定、很脆弱。简而言之，我学会了如何成为一名医生。

成为医生、裁缝或发型设计师不仅需要学习技能。你必须开始像医生、裁缝或发型设计师那样思考，而不只是做他们做的事情。我的内心发生了一些变化。当有人叫我「医生」的时候，我不再感到羞怯。我会转过身来，问道：「我能为您做些什么？」
