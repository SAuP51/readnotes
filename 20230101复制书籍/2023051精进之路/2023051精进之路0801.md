## 0801. 找到自己的声音

0801 Developing voice

My consulting room door opens and Harry comes in. It's a busy morning at my Wiltshire practice; I've got a stack of patients waiting and I'm feeling under pressure. I've met Harry a couple of times, but I don't know him well. He's in his early seventies, with nicotine-stained fingers and a bit of a wheeze. As soon as Harry sits down, I ask him what the problem is. He tells me he's had a cough for several weeks, and he seems worried that there might be something more to it. He doesn't look well, and I feel a bit uneasy. I take out his notes, flicking through his medical history. I'm about to ask him some questions when the consultation freezes. My tutor has paused the tape.

I'm spending a week at a residential college for adult education. I'm on a course to become a GP trainer. If I'm successful, we'll be able to have trainees attached to our practice – doctors who have decided to become GPs themselves. They'll have spent several years working in a hospital as junior doctors, usually on six-month rotations like I did. They'll probably have worked in paediatrics, general medicine and perhaps psychiatry. Then they'll spend a year in a practice, learning on the job under the supervision of their GP trainer. There, they'll learn how different general practice can be from hospital medicine, and they'll spend a lot of time studying and practising the skills of consultation. Every week they'll have an afternoon with their trainer, discussing cases and honing their skills. At first, like me when I started, they'll probably feel rudderless and disoriented, swamped by patients with apparently trivial conditions but terrified of missing one with a serious disease. It will take them a while to understand what general practice is really about. That's where I'll come in as a trainer.

Supervising a trainee, like treating patients, requires a lot of skill. It starts with having insight into your own practice as a doctor. That's what we're learning on the course, and that's why we're starting by analysing our own consultations before helping our trainees with theirs. For most of that week I'm in a room with our tutor Clive, as well as five other doctors who are learning to become trainers. Clive's been a GP for decades, and he's got years of experience in training trainers. He doesn't say much, but his silences are more eloquent than words.

We're watching videos we've recorded over the last couple of weeks. Clive asked us to bring examples of ordinary consultations, not ones we're especially pleased with. But, of course, we've all chosen ones we're proud of. Nobody has brought anything disastrous, and we've each tried to slip in some that show how clever we've been. Like me, the other GPs think we'll be analysing these encounters and looking for diagnostic brilliance, medical knowledge, technical skill. But we don't. Instead, Clive is making us look at how we consult.

I've been in general practice for several years at this point, and I've become reasonably comfortable with consultations. But it has always been just me and my patient. There's been nobody else watching, let alone a group of my peers.

Now it's my turn to be in the spotlight, and I'm terrified. I feel my reputation is on the line. I'm waiting for Clive's comments about the likely cause of Harry's cough. Instead he looks at me thoughtfully and says, ‘I wonder how you're making Harry feel …' Then he sits quietly and waits.

诊室的门开了，哈里走了进来。这天早上，我在威尔特郡的诊室里忙着。有一大堆患者在等我，我感到压力很大。我见过哈里几次，但不太了解他。他 70 岁出头，手指上有尼古丁的黄渍，还有些气喘。哈里一坐下，我就问他有什么问题。他告诉我，他已经咳嗽几个星期了，他似乎在担心问题可能没有那么简单。他脸色不太好，我感到有些不安。我拿出他的文件，翻看他的病历。我正准备问他一些问题，这次问诊的录像就停住了。指导老师暂停了播放。

当时我要在一所成人教育的寄宿制大学里进修一周。我正在上全科医生师资课。如果我成功通过课程，我们的诊所就能招募实习医生了 —— 也就是决定做全科医学工作的医生。他们要在医院里做几年的实习医生，通常每六个月就要轮换科室，就像我当年一样。他们可能在儿科、普通内科或精神科工作过。然后他们会花一年的时间实践，在全科医生培训师的督导下，一边工作一边学习。在这个过程中，他们会学习全科与医院工作的不同之处，他们会花大量时间学习和练习问诊技巧。他们每周都会有一个下午的时间与培训师讨论案例、磨炼技能。刚开始的时候，他们就像当年的我一样，可能会感到目标不明、迷失方向，面对患者各种鸡毛蒜皮的症状不知所措，生怕忽视一个患有重病的患者。他们需要一段时间才能理解全科医学到底是怎么回事。所以他们才需要我这种培训师。

督导实习医生，就像治疗患者一样，需要许多技能。首先要对自己作为医生的工作有很深的了解。这就是我们在师资课程上学的东西，也是为什么我们在帮助实习医生之前要先分析自己的问诊方式。在那一周的大部分时间里，我都和我们的指导老师克莱夫以及其他五名学习成为培训师的医生待在一个房间里。克莱夫已经做了几十年的全科医生，有多年辅导培训师的经验。他话不多，但他的沉默比语言更有说服力。

我们正在看过去几周录制的录像。克莱夫让我们带来一些平常问诊的案例，而不是我们特别满意的案例。不过，我们肯定都选择让自己感到自豪的案例。没有带来什么糟糕的案例，我们每个人都试图上交一些让我们脸上有光的案例，以表明我们当时有多聪明。和我一样，其他全科医生也认为我们会分析这些问诊案例，指出那些绝妙的诊断、渊博的医学知识以及高明的技术能力。

但我们没有这样做。相反，克莱夫让我们审视我们是如何问诊的。此时我在全科医学领域已经工作好几年了，我对问诊也变得相当自如了。但一直以来，工作中就只有我和我的患者。没有其他人旁观，更不用说被一群同行旁观了。

现在轮到我站在聚光灯下了，我感到害怕。我觉得我的名誉岌岌可危。我在等待克莱夫对哈里咳嗽的可能原因发表评论。然而，他若有所思地看着我说：「我在想你会让哈里有什么感觉……」然后他静静地坐着，等我回答。

### 8.1 找到你的声音

Developing your voice

When Clive asked how I thought I was making Harry feel, he wasn't talking about the cause of his cough. He was talking about Harry's experience of being with me in my consulting room. From this perspective, a clinical consultation is an encounter between a professional performer (in this case, me) and an audience (in this case, Harry). The audience's experience of the performance is shaped by the performer's ‘voice'. That's what makes each doctor's style unique. In the previous chapter we looked at how you put yourself aside, focusing instead on your patient, your client or whoever your work is for. Now we'll look at how you bring yourself back in – how you develop voice.

Paul Haidet, a jazz musician and family doctor at Penn State College of Medicine in the United States, has studied this in detail. He writes about an expert's ability to ‘drop' what they have learned formally but still draw on it in the moment as they respond to what is happening around them. He sees parallels between medicine and music, too. As a jazz musician, you spend years with your instrument, practising scales, learning repertoire, mastering theory, developing techniques. But then the ones who make a mark, as Haidet puts it, are those ‘who channel the theory, technique and ideas of their predecessors through their own personalities, feelings and experiences'. This is what jazz musicians call ‘developing voice'. That's how you instantly recognize a recording of Miles Davis, Chet Baker or Freddie Hubbard from the first couple of notes, if you know that kind of music.

Jeremy Jackman, former counter-tenor in the King's Singers vocal ensemble, explained voice to me like this: ‘When you're a small child and your mother reads you a bedtime story, you get used to how she reads it. When your Aunt Ethel comes to stay and she reads you that story, the words are the same but the story sounds different. Her voice – not just literally, but how she interprets the words and the meaning – is unique. It's like that with music too.'

Something similar happens in all fields. My wife makes hats, and I can spot one of her hats in a room full of other people's. Similarly, if you gave me a page of writing by John le Carré, one of my favourite writers, I'd be able to know it was him rather than John D. MacDonald, whose crime novels I also devour. In your own work, whatever that may be, your voice is what differentiates you from your colleagues.

Voice dictates how you implement the ‘it's not about you' of the previous chapter. This is especially relevant in performances where your audience is very small. In medicine, that audience is often just one person. Even with a family consultation, it's seldom more than three or four.

Voice is how you tell one doctor from another. I had to learn how to recognize and acknowledge my voice as a doctor, and how to use that for my patients. In this chapter, we'll explore what happens when we think of experts as close-up live performers with a very small audience. We'll look at how to perform, and how developing your voice is part of becoming expert.

As doctors on that course for aspiring GP trainers, we'd passed the point where we were talking about medical knowledge. Anyone becoming a GP will already have spent years in the initial stages of becoming expert. They'll have done time and learned to touch, feel and see. They'll have made a lot of mistakes and put them right. They'll have grappled with the need to keep all that knowledge and skill out of view, to make the ‘it's not about you' transition we examined in Chapter 7 . But they may not have thought about voice. Yet voice is essential to performance. It captures your uniqueness, your style. Developing voice is something we all do as we internalize and transform what we've learned, and use it to become ourselves – whether as a plumber, an accountant or anything else.

当克莱夫问我让哈里有什么感觉时，他指的并不是哈里咳嗽的原因。他指的是哈里和我一起在诊室里的感受。从这个角度来看，临床问诊是专业表演者（在这个例子里，也就是我）与观众（哈里）之间的一次相遇。观众对于表演的体验是由表演者的「声音」塑造的。这就是为什么每个医生的风格都是独一无二的。在上一章里，我们讨论了如何把自己放在一边，把注意力放在患者、客户或你的任何工作受众身上。现在我们要讨论如何让自己回来 —— 如何找到自己的声音。

爵士音乐家、美国宾夕法尼亚州立医学院的家庭医生保罗·海德特（Paul Haidet）对这个问题进行了详细的研究。他曾写过，专家有能力「放下」自己正式学过的东西，但依然能在对周围发生的事情做出反应时利用这些东西。他也看到了医学与音乐之间的相似之处。作为一名爵士音乐家，你要花多年的时间演奏乐器、练习音阶、学习曲目、掌握乐理、锻炼技能。但是，正如海德特所说，那些被人记住的人，都是「借用自身个性、情感和经历表达前人的理论、技术和思想」的人。这就是爵士音乐家所说的「找到自己的声音」。这也是为什么你能通过最初的几个音符辨认出迈尔斯·戴维斯（Miles Davis）、查特·贝克（Chet Baker）或弗雷迪·哈伯德（Freddie Hubbard），国王歌手合唱团的前任假声男高音杰里米·杰克曼（Jeremy 如果你熟悉这类音乐的话。

Jackman）是这样解释「声音」的：「当你还是小孩子的时候，你妈妈会给你读睡前故事，而你会习惯她读故事的方式。你的埃塞尔姨妈来做客的时候，她也给你读了那个故事。文字是一样的，但故事听起来不同。她的声音是独一无二的 —— 不仅是指字面意义上的声音，还包括她对文字与含义的理解。音乐也是如此。」

所有领域里都有类似的事情。我妻子制作帽子，在一屋子别人的帽子里，我能认出哪一顶是她做的。同样地，如果你给我一页约翰·勒卡雷（John le Carré）的作品（他是我最喜欢的作家之一），我就能认出是他写的，而不是约翰·D. 麦克唐纳（John D.MacDonald）的作品 —— 我也很喜欢后者的犯罪小说。无论你的工作是什么，你在工作中的「声音」是让你不同于同事的原因。

「声音」决定了你如何实现上一章所说的「重点不在于你」。如果你的「观众」很少，这一点对于你的「表演」来说就尤其重要。在医疗工作中，「观众」通常只有一个人。即使是家庭问诊，也很少会超过三四个人。

「声音」是你区分不同医生的关键。我必须学会如何识别并注意到我作为医生的声音，以及如何将其用于为患者服务。在本章中，我们要探讨作为「近距离现场表演者」的专家为少量观众「表演」时会发生的事情。我们会探讨如何「表演」，如何在成为专家的道路上找到自己的「声音」。

作为有志成为全科医生培训师的医生，我们已经不再讨论医学知识了。任何一个成为全科医生的人，都已经在成为专家的初始阶段花了多年的时间。他们都有深厚的积累，都学会了触摸、感觉与观察。他们犯过错，也纠正过很多错误。他们都曾努力把所有知识和技能放在一旁，都做出我们在第 7 章探讨的「重点不在于你」的转变。但是，他们可能还没有思考过「声音」。然而「声音」对于「表演」来说至关重要。「声音」传达了你的独特性、你的风格。当我们内化和转化我们所学的东西，利用这些东西成为我们自己的时候，我们就会找到我们的「声音」—— 无论你是管道工、会计还是其他领域的工作者。

### 8.2 世上没有完美的西装

There's no such thing as a perfect suit

Joshua the tailor has voice too. He likes working with all kinds of customers, not just the straightforward ones; for Joshua, this is a challenge to relish. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he deliberately sought out difficult or unusual clients while he was training. Sometimes the challenges were physical – people with asymmetries, spinal deformities or differently shaped limbs. At other times the challenges were about personality – people who were aggressive or demanding, obsessed by detail or difficult to please. The other tailors were delighted when he took those customers, as it gave them an easier life.

Joshua's second apprenticeship was with Arthur, a master cutting tailor. It was Arthur who taught him the principles of designing a suit from scratch. That allowed Joshua to create something unique for each client, something that suited that man's personality and met his needs. After Arthur retired, Joshua left that tailoring house and set up his own business in partnership with his wife. That's when he established his voice as an independent craftsman. No longer constrained by bosses and colleagues, by ‘how we do things around here', he was free to bring together the skills he had learned and establish his own identity.

Early on in becoming a tailor, Joshua realized that there were many possible solutions to any problem. ‘There is no perfect suit,' he explained to me. ‘You are always striking a balance, a compromise between what the suit looks like on the hanger and what it feels like on the man. A garment is always an interpretation. You have to recognize and respond to people's instinctive reactions, whether they are aware of those reactions or not. Otherwise they won't be truly happy with what you create.'

Part of the satisfaction for Joshua was the clothes he designed, the end product of his work. But what excited him most was the opportunity to work with people and find out what they wanted. This is more difficult than it sounds.

With the freedom of developing your voice comes responsibility. As you stop being a cipher in someone else's workshop and develop your individuality as an expert, you accept responsibility for what you do. Once Joshua started his own business and could become the kind of tailor he wanted to be, he had to make it work. He had to live with the consequences of his decisions. During his years of doing time, learning to see and to do, he had absorbed and internalized the style of his masters. His work at that time was recognizably that of the tailoring house he was employed by, and he had the security of working in an organization. Now he was on his own, creating his own style and curating each client's experience of having a suit or jacket made by him. He was developing his voice.

By the time I started thinking of my voice as a GP, I was an experienced doctor. It was over twenty years since I'd started as a medical student, spending all those hours in a formalin-filled fug in the dissecting room and doing the bloods on a hospital ward. It was easy to forget how I'd struggled in those early days of doing time, learning to see and to touch, and the other steps I've described in this book. But, outside medicine, I was still going through those initial stages. And they came flooding back when I started to play my harpsichord.

裁缝约书亚也有自己的「声音」。他喜欢与各式各样的顾客打交道，而不仅仅是那些直截了当的人。对约书亚来说，这是一个值得享受的挑战。与那一辈的许多裁缝不同，他在学习的时候就故意寻找困难的、不同寻常的客人。有时这种挑战是身体上的 —— 有些客人的身体不对称、脊柱或四肢畸形。还有些时候，这些挑战是个性上的 —— 有些客人咄咄逼人、要求苛刻、过分关注细节或者难以满足。他接待这些顾客时，其他裁缝都很高兴，因为这让他们的工作更轻松了。

约书亚第二次做学徒时，他的老师是亚瑟，一名剪裁裁缝大师。亚瑟教会了他从零开始设计西装的原则。这让约书亚能够为每位客人创造一些独特的东西，适合那个人的个性、满足其需求的东西。亚瑟退休后，约书亚离开了他的裁缝店，与妻子合伙开了自己的店。从那时起，他就找到了自己作为独立匠人的「声音」。不再受老板和同事的限制，不再受「我们在这儿这么做事」的限制，他终于能够自由地把他学到的技能融会贯通，确立自己的身份认同了。

在刚开始学习裁缝的时候，约书亚意识到，任何问题都有许多可能的解决方案。「没有完美的西装，」他向我解释道，「你一直在寻找平衡，在西装挂在衣架上的样子和穿在一个人身上的感觉之间做出妥协。衣服是一种诠释。你必须意识到他人的本能反应，并做出回应 —— 无论他们意识到那些反应与否。否则他们就不会对你创造的东西真正地感到满意。」

让约书亚感到满足的部分原因是他设计的服装，他工作的最终产品。但最让他兴奋的是，他有机会与他人一起工作，发现他们想要什么。这比听起来要难得多。

随着你自由地寻找自己的「声音」，责任也随之而来。你不再是他人工坊里的无名小卒，而是开始发展自己个性的专家，你要为自己所做的事情承担责任。一旦约书亚创办了自己的裁缝店，能够成为他想成为的裁缝，他就必须做好自己的工作。

他必须承担他的决定所带来的后果。在积累的那些年里，他学会了看和做，吸收并内化了他师父的风格。他当时的工作明显带有他所在的裁缝店的风格，他所在的组织给予了他保障。现在，他创造了自己的风格，通过亲手制作西装套装或上衣来为每位客人的体验负责。他在寻找自己的「声音」。

在我开始考虑自己作为全科医生的「声音」时，我已经是一个经验丰富的医生了。从我开始学医起已经过去了 20 多年，那时我花了大量时间待在充斥着甲醛气味的解剖室里，以及在医院病房里采血。我很容易忘记在刚开始工作时，在学习观察、触摸时，以及在本书中描述过的其他阶段里的困难。但是，在医学之外，我依然会经历那些初始的阶段。在我开始弹奏羽管键琴的时候，那种感觉又像洪水一样涌了回来。

### 8.3 音乐与他人

Music and other people

Though I'd finished assembling my instrument from the kit, I barely knew how to play it. To begin with, I practised on my own and tried to get the hang of it. I'd learned the piano as a child and had taken up the pipe organ as a junior doctor, but I'd never played with other people. While the harpsichord has a huge solo repertoire, much of its music is performed in a group. It seemed a shame to keep my instrument to myself, though I was nervous about playing with others. So I took a deep breath, then signed up for a weekend residential course on baroque chamber music. I managed to squeeze my harpsichord into the car and I set off.

There were about thirty of us, all amateurs. Some, like me, were just beginning. Others were more experienced, and some were technically pretty advanced. Helping us to make sense of it all were three expert tutors. In the first session I found myself in a group with a cellist, a violinist and a recorder player. Our tutor gave us a pile of sheet music by composers I'd never heard of, and told us to get on with it. Sonatas, suites, dances – the pop music of its day. We didn't practise, we just played each one through at sight, then went on to the next. A lot of the pieces were repetitive and rather boring, but we played them anyway.

As a harpsichordist, I was in the continuo section. This is in the background most of the time, like the rhythm section in a jazz band. The cello plays the bass line as written by the composer, and the harpsichord fills in with harmonies. Continuo performers in the baroque period would have been expert at doing this, but I'd never played with others before, let alone tried to sight-read an unfamiliar piece.

Continuo playing gives a lot of freedom, as you're not expected to play only what's on the page. But there's also a lot of responsibility, because you have to fill out the bass line with chords, supporting but not competing with the others in the group. You play from a ‘figured bass' – numerical codes that tell you the harmonies the composer intended. It's like trying to do a crossword puzzle while reading aloud and cooking a soufflé at the same time. I wondered how I would cope. I was terrified of getting lost or playing a wrong note.

The first thing I learned was that nobody really cared what I played. They were all concentrating on their own parts, and they only became aware of me if I got in the way or made a blunder. I was like the mantelpiece clock that you only notice when it stops ticking. From being the centre of my own attention, I became someone who made a small twangly noise in the background. As one of the tutors put it: ‘Just keep going, Roger. Even if every note you play is wrong. As long as you start together and finish together, what happens in between isn't so important.'

Playing in that group made me listen – really listen – to the musicians around me. Instead of focusing on my hands, or on my skill (or lack of it) as a harpsichordist, I had to think how I would contribute. At first, I was scared that I'd lose my place and make an idiot of myself. Then I realized that sitting right next to me was an excellent cellist, and that we were playing the same bass line. If I felt overwhelmed, I knew that she would keep going, allowing me to skip a few bars and get back on the rails by listening to her. All I had to do was find my place, play the single bass line on the written page, and make sure I was in tempo with the other players. Then I could start to think about how to fill in the harmonies. To do that, I had to widen my attentional focus, to be aware of the ensemble as a whole and to listen.

At first I was happy to blend in without being noticed. But over time, something surprising happened. I became aware that I wasn't an interchangeable cipher; I was making an essential contribution after all. I realized that how I played was as important as what I played. I found I was developing a style, a way of playing that was recognizably mine. It wasn't just whether I played the right notes, but how I became part of the ensemble. I learned that less is more, that people valued the way I remained inconspicuous, didn't put in needless flourishes, avoided showing off. And the way I did that was distinctive. This was my voice.

I went to these workshops for several years running. One year, there were three of us harpsichord players. When we were deciding who would play with whom, a cellist I remembered from a previous course told me she'd like me to be in her group. ‘You're the one who listens,' she said. I felt very proud. I'd developed my own approach to continuo playing; I was starting to create my own style. Of course, I wasn't expert – far from it. Playing the harpsichord is a hobby for me, not a career. But I had made a transition that was immensely satisfying, and it made all those hours of practice worthwhile. I was able to play in my own way and be part of making music I'd always loved to listen to. My identity as a harpsichordist had moved up a level.

虽然我已经完成了羽管键琴的组装，但我几乎不知道该怎么弹。我先是自己练习，试图掌握其中的窍门。我小时候学过钢琴，在做实习医生的时候学过管风琴，但从来没有与他人合奏过。虽然羽管键琴有大量独奏曲目，但大部分曲目都是合奏的。虽然我对合奏感到紧张，但独自一人弹奏这件乐器似乎是一种遗憾。于是我深吸一口气，然后报名参加了一门巴洛克室内乐的寄宿制课程。我设法把羽管键琴塞进车里，然后就出发了。

这门课上大约有 30 个人，都是业余学员。有些人（比如我）才刚刚开始学。有些人更有经验，还有几个人的技术已经很高超了。有三位老师帮助我们学习这些东西。在第一节课上，我和一个大提琴手、小提琴手和竖笛手在一个组里。我们组的老师给了我们一堆我从未听说过的作曲家的乐谱，让我们开始练习。奏鸣曲、组曲、舞曲 —— 都是当时的流行音乐。我们没有练习，只是照着曲谱演奏一遍，然后演奏下一曲。很多曲子的旋律都是重复的，相当无聊，但我们还是演奏了。

作为羽管键琴手，我负责键盘低声部。这个声部在大部分时间里都是背景，就像爵士乐队里的节奏声部。大提琴负责演奏作曲家写的低音乐句，而羽管键琴负责填充和声。巴洛克时代的键盘低声部演奏者通常是专家，但我从来没有和别人一起演奏过，更没有试过视奏不熟悉的曲子。

演奏键盘低声部有很多自由，你不必完全按照乐谱演奏；但也有很多责任，因为你必须用和弦填充低音乐句，支持乐队里的其他人，而不是与之竞争。你要按照「数字低音」来演奏 —— 这是一种数字符号，告诉你作曲家想要的和声。这就好像要一边大声朗读，一边做填字游戏，一边做蛋奶酥一样。我不知道该怎么做到。我很害怕看错乐谱或弹错音符。

我学到的第一件事是，没有人真正关心我弹的是什么。他们都把注意力集中在了自己演奏的部分上，只有在我碍事或犯错时，他们才会注意到我。我就像壁炉上方的时钟，只有在停住的时候你才会注意到它。我不再把注意力放在自己身上，让自己变成了一个在背景里发出轻微拨弦声的人。正如其中一位老师所说：「继续弹，罗杰。即使你弹的每个音符都是错的，也要继续弹下去。只要你们一起开始，一起结束，中间发生的事情就不那么重要了。」

在乐队里演奏让我学会了倾听（真正的倾听）身边的演奏者。我不再专注于自己的双手，也不再关注我演奏羽管键琴的技巧（我也没什么技巧），我必须思考如何做出贡献。起初，我害怕我会跟不上大家，让自己出尽洋相。然后，我意识到，坐在我旁边的是一位出色的大提琴手，而我们演奏的是相同的低音乐句。如果我感到手忙脚乱，我知道她会继续拉下去，允许我跳过几个小节，通过听她的演奏回到正轨。我要做的就是找到自己的位置，弹奏乐谱上的低音乐句，确保自己与其他演奏者节奏一致。然后我就可以开始思考如何填充和声了。要做到这一点，我必须扩大我的注意力范围，注意整个乐队，用心倾听。

起初，我很高兴能融入团队而不被注意。但随着时间的推移，令人惊讶的事情发生了。我意识到我不是一个无足轻重的部分，而是做出了重要的贡献。我意识到，我演奏的方式与我演奏的内容一样重要。我发现我正在形成一种风格，一种属于我的鲜明演奏特点。这不仅仅在于我能否弹出正确的音符，更在于我如何成为乐队的一分子。我懂得了「少即是多」，懂得了大家珍视我的低调，不画蛇添足，不炫耀自己。我演奏的方式很独特。这就是我的「声音」。

我连续几年都在参加这种工作坊。有一年，工作坊里有我们三个羽管键琴手。当我们决定谁和谁一组时，有一个上次和我一同上课的大提琴手告诉我，她想让我和她一组。「你是个会倾听的人。」她说。我感到非常自豪。我找到了自己演奏键盘低声部的方式，我开始拥有了自己的风格。当然，我不是专家 —— 远远不是。弹奏羽管键琴是我的爱好，而不是职业。但我做出了一种非常让人满意的转变，让漫长的练习都变得值得了。我能用自己的方式弹琴，参与演奏我一直都喜欢听的音乐。我作为羽管键琴手的身份提升到了更高的层次。

### 8.4 问题之大

The immensity of the problem

Voice isn't only about what you say and how you say it. It involves all of the senses. It includes how you engage with people, how you relate to them, how you touch them and how you respond when they touch you. Voice shapes how you navigate the space between you and whoever you are with. It can also be expressed by how you configure the physical setting you work in. My GP partners and I put a lot of thought into how we designed the consulting rooms in our practice. We wanted our patients to feel comfortable and able to talk, but we also needed to be able to carry out clinical examinations. Each GP made different concessions, and their choices reflected their personality.

Staring at my own consulting room on the frozen video screen at the GP trainers course, Clive, the other doctors and I considered how it reflected my approach. Then we restarted my consultation with Harry about his cough. We watched another thirty seconds. On the screen, I was starting to listen to Harry's chest with my stethoscope. Clive suddenly paused the tape again and said, ‘Why are you doing that?'

I was nonplussed. Surely it was obvious. Listening with a stethoscope is part of making a diagnosis; it's what doctors do. The mantra of ‘inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation' is so deeply embedded from my medical-school days that I'd never thought to question it. But Clive wanted to know what was going through my mind when I picked up my stethoscope – what I was planning to do next.

One of the other GPs said, ‘I use my stethoscope to buy time while I think what I'm going to say.' Another told us, ‘I use mine to reassure my patients that I know what I'm doing, that I've got knowledge and skill, so they trust me when I give them a diagnosis.' I hadn't thought of it like that before, but it made a lot of sense. Sometimes a stethoscope is just a stethoscope, but often it's more. A stethoscope is a symbol of our profession, and people expect you to use it.

Clive pointed out that we would all have managed this consultation differently and that we'd probably all be equally effective, despite our differences in approach. At medical school I'd been taught that each patient had a diagnosis and that our task was to find it. But for Clive, it wasn't as simple as that. He made me focus on my individual way of being a doctor, on my performance and my voice.

Developing voice is part of the Journeyman phase. It's when you shift from being able to do some of the things experts do to starting to become expert yourself. It's when you develop your own ways of responding to whoever you are with and dealing with the unexpected. But this needs a combination of humility and self-confidence, and that's a difficult balance to achieve.

As you develop voice, you're not abandoning what you have learned; you're reshaping it. As we saw with the music groups I took part in, you don't have to wait years for this to happen. The steps we've explored don't happen in strict linear order, and they often overlap. For instance, if you've already become expert in one area then it can help when you move into another, as Joshua found with his second apprenticeship. But all the time you're moving towards independence, towards becoming comfortable with your own way of doing things. You're creating an identity.

As you develop your voice, you realize that technical skill is necessary but not sufficient. It's how you apply that skill that matters. You must know a lot and be able to do a lot, but only bring out what's relevant in that moment. You must avoid showing off. Performers have known this for centuries. Staying with baroque music for a moment longer, C. P. E. Bach (one of Johann Sebastian Bach's many sons) wrote An Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments , published in 1753. Discussing technique and interpretation, he said: ‘Keyboardists whose chief asset is mere technique are clearly at a disadvantage … They overwhelm our hearing without satisfying it and stun the mind without moving it … A mere technician, however, can lay no claim to the rewards of those who sway in gentle undulation the ear rather than the eye, the heart rather than the ear, and lead it where they will.' The ability to sway the ear in gentle undulation is what an expert does.

Over two hundred years later, in 1966, the legendary jazz pianist Bill Evans recorded a conversation with his brother Harry in which they talked about Bill's approach to playing. He'd developed this a decade earlier, shutting himself up in his garage in 1954 for over a year to work on his technique. He went right back to basics, even though he'd already been playing professionally. In that conversation, Bill says:

The whole process of learning to play jazz is to take these problems from the outer level in, one by one, and to stay with it at a very intense, conscious-concentration level until that process becomes secondary and subconscious … Most people just don't realize the immensity of the problem and, either because they can't conquer it immediately, think that they haven't got the ability, or they're so impatient to conquer it that they never do see it through … They would rather approximate the entire problem than to take a small part of it and be real and true about it. To approximate the whole thing in a vague way gives you a feeling that you've more or less touched the thing, but in this way you just lead yourself toward confusion and ultimately you're going to get so confused that you'll never find your way out … If you try to approximate something that is very advanced and don't know what you're doing, you can't advance.

Evans puts his finger on something important here. As we develop our individuality, we watch and copy experts we admire. But until we have been through what they have been through, there's no point trying to copy their flourishes. Developing your voice emerges from the initial stages of hard graft and rigour, and you can't short-circuit the process. You can imitate experts, but you can't yet do what they are really doing. Like Bill Evans in his garage, you have to work that out for yourself.

Those senior consultants who listened quietly on a ward round when I was a young doctor, then came up with a new diagnosis, could only do that because of their years of experience. Those GPs who just seemed to ‘know' what questions to ask had gone through a similar process. As a trainee, I could imitate their behaviour as much as I liked, but I had nothing to base my pronouncements on. Your voice has to reflect an inner state of being expert, or you'll only be able to use it in circumstances you have already encountered. You'll struggle at the margins when things start to unravel. To be expert, your voice must remain recognizably yours, even when you are in situations you haven't encountered before.

That ability starts with the steps outlined in Chapters 1 to 5. You have to have spent months and years acquiring the skills of your craft or profession, getting them under your belt and making them second nature. You have to know that you can work to a consistent standard, and that you have mastered your core skills. You have to know you can give a good performance in any circumstances – even when you are feeling tired, out of sorts, or working with unruly materials under challenging conditions.

Voice is tied up with identity and confidence, with who and what you believe yourself to be. It wasn't until well after I qualified that I felt I had really ‘become' a doctor. Before that, I knew a lot of the things that doctors knew, and I could do a lot of the things that doctors did, but I hadn't become one myself. Gradually I became comfortable with my new identity – for a while, at least.

Then I started my surgical training and the same thing happened again. For years I would say ‘I'm training to become a surgeon', even when I was leading surgical teams in big, difficult operations. I hadn't yet settled into being a surgeon. Eventually that changed, and by the time I became a consultant ten years later, if someone asked me what I did I'd say, ‘I'm a surgeon.' The process repeated itself when I became a GP, and again when I became an academic. Voice isn't as straightforward as it sounds.

To be effective, voice must be authentic. You are drawing on aspects of yourself that are already there, not creating a new identity. You adapt and respond to each situation and the people that you're with. For instance, similar to my harpsichord playing style, I wanted to be a doctor who listened and responded to each patient's tempo. First I would fit in, and then start to shape the conversation. I might speed things up or slow them down. I would conduct the consultation while allowing my patient the freedom to express what they wanted. I would try to keep the whole context in mind, balancing the needs of the patient I was with and those of the others waiting outside.

「声音」不仅在于你说话的内容与方式。「声音」涉及所有的感官，包括如何与人打交道，如何与他们建立关系，如何触摸他们，以及在他们触摸你时如何回应。「声音」决定了你如何处理你与他人之间的空间。「声音」还能通过你布置工作的物理环境的方式得以表达出来。我和我的全科医生合伙人在设计诊室上花费了许多心思。我们希望患者感觉舒适，愿意说话，但我们也要能够进行临床检查。每位全科医生都会做不同的取舍，而他们的选择反映了他们的个性。

在那堂全科医生师资课上，克莱夫、其他医生和我盯着屏幕上暂停的录像，看着我的诊室，思考它如何反映了我的工作方式。然后，我们继续播放我那次关于哈里的咳嗽的问诊。我们又看了 30 秒。屏幕里的我开始用听诊器去听哈里的胸口。克莱夫突然再次暂停了录像，问道：「你为什么要这样做？」

我有些不知所措。这不是明摆着的吗？使用听诊器是做诊断的一部分。医生不就是干这个的吗？「视诊、触诊、叩诊、听诊」这一口诀在我上医学院时就已经深深地扎根于我的脑海了，我从没想过要质疑它。但是克莱夫想知道，在拿起听诊器时，我在想什么 —— 我打算接下来做什么。

有一位全科医生说：「我用听诊器是为了争取时间，思考我接下来要说什么。」另一位医生说：「我用听诊器是为了让患者相信我知道我在做什么，我有足够的知识和技能，这样在我给他们诊断时，他们就会相信我。」我以前从没这样想过，但听起来很有道理。有时听诊器只是听诊器，但它所代表的意义常常不止如此。听诊器是我们职业的象征，大家希望你用它。

克莱夫指出，我们都会用不同的方式来处理这次问诊，尽管我们的方式不同，但我们的方法可能同样有效。在医学院，我学到的是，每个患者都有一个诊断，而我们的任务就是找到这个诊断。但是对克莱夫来说，事情并没有那么简单。他让我关注我做医生的独特工作方式，关注我的表现和「声音」。

找到自己的「声音」，是熟练工阶段的一部分。在这个阶段，你不仅能做到一些专家做的事情，并且开始成为专家了；你还要形成与人打交道、处理意外情况的独特方式。但是，这既需要谦虚，又需要自信，这是一种难以达到的平衡。

在你寻找自己的「声音」时，你并没有放弃学到的东西，而是在重塑这些东西。从我参加的音乐小组课程中可以看出，你不需要等上很多年才会经历这个阶段。我们探讨的这些步骤不是按照严格顺序发生的，它们之间通常会有重叠。例如，如果你已经在一个领域里成为专家，这就有助于你进入另一个领域。约书亚在第二次学徒生涯中就发现了这一点。无论如何，你始终在走向独立，逐渐适应自己独有的做事方式。你在创造一种身份认同。

在你寻找自己的「声音」时，你会意识到，专业技能是必要但不足够的。重要的是你如何运用这些技能。你必须博学、能干，但只在适当的时候运用与状况相关的知识。你必须避免炫耀。表演者们在几个世纪前就明白了这一点。再看一个巴洛克音乐的例子，C.P.E. 巴赫（C.P.E.Bach，约翰·塞巴斯蒂安·巴赫的众多儿子之一）于 1753 年出版了《论键盘乐器演奏的真正艺术》（An Essay on the True Art of Playing KeyboardInstruments）一书。他在讨论技巧与诠释时说：「仅仅长于技巧的键盘乐器演奏家有一个明显的劣势…… 他们让我们的听觉不堪重负，却不能为之带来满足，让我们的心灵惊异不已，却能为之带来感动…… 然而，一介技工所获得的荣誉，绝对无法和那些不满足于迷惑人眼，而是用柔和平缓的乐音打动人耳乃至人心的人相提并论。」用柔和平缓的乐音打动人耳，正是专家的长处。

在两百多年后的 1966 年，传奇爵士钢琴家比尔·埃文斯（Bill Evans）录下了与哥哥哈里·埃文斯（Harry Evans）的一段对话。在这段对话中，他们谈到了比尔的演奏方法。他早在十年前就发明了这种方法。1954 年，他把自己关在车库里，花了一年多的时间去磨炼自己的技术。尽管他已经是职业钢琴家了，但他还是回到了基本功的训练中。在那段对话中，比尔说：

学习演奏爵士乐的整个过程，就是一个接一个地深入问题内部，让自己保持在非常强烈、非常专注的水平上，直到这个学习过程变成次要的，深入潜意识…… 大多数人都没有意识到整体问题之大，要么是因为他们无法立即完成这件事，认为自己没有这种能力；要么是因为他们操之过急，从没有把这件事情研究透彻…… 他们只愿意做到差不多的程度，不愿意把整件事分成许多较小的部分，真诚、认真地对待这一小部分。用「差不多」的态度对待整件事情，会让你觉得自己或多或少了解了这件事，但这样只会让自己陷入困惑，最终你会不知何去何从，永远找不到出路…… 如果你试图用「差不多」的态度对待很高深的问题，却不清楚自己在做什么，那你就不能进步。

埃文斯指出了一个重要的问题。在我们发展自己的个性时，我们会观察和模仿自己欣赏的专家。但是，没有他们的经历，却试图模仿他们的风格是没有意义的。只有在最初阶段里艰苦奋斗、严格要求自己，你才能找到自己的「声音」，没有捷径可走。你可以模仿专家，但你还做不到他们真正能做的事情。就像在车库里的比尔·埃文斯一样，你必须找到自己的出路。

在我还是个年轻医生的时候，那些资深的顾问医师会在查房时静静地倾听，然后提出一个完全不同的诊断。只有多年的经验才能让他们做到这一点。那些似乎「知道」该问什么问题的全科医生，也经历了类似的过程。在实习的时候，我可以尽情模仿那些医生的行为，但我的任何断言都缺乏根基。你的「声音」必须反映出一种专家的内在状态，否则你只能在以前遇到过的情况下使用你的「声音」。随着事情的发展，你可能就会力不从心。要成为专家，你的「声音」必须保持鲜明的个人特色，即使在你从未遇到过的情况下也是如此。

这种能力源于我们在第 1-5 章所概述的那些步骤。你必须花费数月乃至数年的时间锻炼专业技能，让这些技能烂熟于胸，成为你的第二天性。你必须有把握按照一致的标准工作，并且知道自己已经掌握了核心技能。你必须有把握在任何情况下都能表现良好 —— 即使在感到疲惫、心情不好，或者在有挑战性的情况下处理难以驾驭的工作对象时也是如此。

「声音」与你的身份认同和信心息息相关，与你心目中自己的本质与身份息息相关。直到取得医师资格很久之后，我才觉得自己真正成了一名医生。在那以前，我知道很多医生知道的事情，也能做很多医生能做的事情，但我自己并没有成为医生。渐渐地，我适应了自己的新身份 —— 至少在一段时间内如此。

然后我开始学习外科，相同的事情又发生了。多年以来，我一直说「我在接受外科的训练」，即使在我带领外科团队做大型、困难的手术时也是这样。我还没有习惯于做外科医生。这一切渐渐改变了。在我十年后成为顾问医师时，如果有人问我是做什么的，我就会说：「我是外科医生。」在我成为全科医生时，这个过程又重复了一遍。在我成为学者的时候也是如此。

找到「声音」并不像听起来那么简单。为了有效地指导工作，「声音」必须是真实的。你要借鉴自身已有的方面，而不是创造一个新的身份。你要适应并应对每一种情况，以及身边的其他人。例如，就像我演奏羽管键琴的风格一样，我想成为一个愿意倾听、及时回应每位患者的医生。

首先我会和患者搭上话，然后开始引导对话。我可能会加快谈话的节奏，也可能放慢速度。我会在主导问诊的同时，让患者自由地表达他们的想法。我会尽量顾全大局，平衡面前这位患者的需求与在外面等候的患者的需求。

### 8.5「声音」的隐秘陷阱

The subtle seductions of voice

At this stage in the path of becoming expert, you are learning to hold two aspects in creative tension: bedrock knowledge and performance in the moment. In the early stages, the emphasis is on knowledge, skills and joining a community of practice. As you start to fly solo, taking more responsibility for your own actions, your style and personality become more prominent. As we've seen, that's when your voice emerges. But there are pitfalls if your voice becomes too idiosyncratic and you lose touch with how it lands.

A patient going through the menopause told me she'd seen a female doctor about her symptoms. ‘Think of it like this,' the doctor had told her. ‘Your body is changing. You used to be a plum. Now you're becoming a prune.' I know what the doctor meant, but many people would have been offended by her choice of words. Fortunately, this patient found it hilarious. But voice is a double-edged sword. Because you are using your own personality as a tool, you need self-awareness and sensitivity to monitor how you come across to other people. You have to recognize that your way of putting things may not have the effect you intended.

When I was a medical student in Manchester, I spent time in an infertility clinic with a consultant gynaecologist. He'd start each consultation by explaining some basic medical facts. ‘Humans reproduce by eggs, like chickens,' he would say, ‘only human eggs are much smaller and they're inside. Do you understand?' On one occasion, the patient listened attentively without saying anything. For some reason, the consultant paused and asked her if she had a job. ‘Yes – I'm a lecturer, here at the university,' she replied. ‘What do you lecture on?' he asked. ‘Human reproductive biology,' she said. The consultant had the grace to look abashed for a moment, but then, alarmingly, he carried on with his spiel exactly as he had done a thousand times before.

Whether it's gynaecology or graphic design, it's no use having a ‘standard' approach. Salespeople know they can't use the same patter every time they pitch. That quickly becomes inauthentic, and prevents either party really listening. Your voice is not just what you say, or even how you say it. It's the means by which you engage – whether with a patient, client, colleague or customer. It's how you connect.

Experts' handling of voice can be impressive – a lot goes on under the surface. The most skilful GPs I ever met seemed able to put their finger on a patient's problem with no apparent effort. They weren't displaying medical knowledge, they were just listening – and maybe doing a little talking. They didn't drive things, or insist on asking questions in a specified order. They didn't show off. They seemed able to crystallize any problem without effort. Yet ask them afterwards what was going on and their language would switch in a flash. They would describe how they'd been considering this diagnosis or that, and weighing up the chances that it might be something serious. They'd talk about recent papers they had read, or how they were thinking about referring the patient to one specialist or another. They would have made contingency plans and put safety nets in place in case they'd got things wrong. Yet none of this was obvious. For their patients, the consultation was just something natural: a conversation that helped.

Joshua does something similar when he's with a client. He's quietly confident and competent, making sensible suggestions and helping each person navigate the many choices confronting them. But scratch the surface and you find his knowledge is encyclopedic. He's not only an expert in the design and construction of suits, he also knows about style and the history of fashion and materials. You wouldn't necessarily be aware of that, because he only brings it out when he needs it.

But voice can have a dark side too. Voice is so powerful that it can hide laziness or lack of knowledge. Its very power makes it open to corruption or abuse. Bravura performance can conceal ignorance, or mask unjustified self-confidence. If deficiencies in knowledge and skill are overcompensated for by dazzling performance, voice can morph into charisma or mere charm. Factual knowledge can fray, and skills degrade. I saw this with senior clinicians whose medical knowledge was drifting out of date but whose performance continued to improve. Their facility at a personal level concealed a disconnection from advances in the wider world. Most of the time little harm resulted, but the asymmetry in power between an apparent expert (the doctor) and an apparent non-expert (the patient) meant that such people often went unchallenged. Sometimes their lack of up-to-date knowledge led to disaster, and an important diagnosis was missed.

So, there is a fine line to tread. Too far in one direction and you are a mechanical dispenser of textbook information, purveying formulaic, preformed solutions which may not address the real problem. Too far in the other direction and it's all about you again, a self-indulgent focus on your personality and performance. Experts steer a path between these twin dangers – between suppressing their voice and relying on it too much. They avoid placing too much emphasis on personality and too little on knowledge and skill.

在成为专家的这一阶段，你会学习如何用创造性的方式把握这两个方面；基础知识与当下的表现。在早期阶段，你的重点是知识、技能以及加入实践社群。随着你独当一面，为自己的行为承担更多的责任时，你的风格和个性开始变得更加突出。

正如我们所见，这时你的「声音」就会显现出来。但是，如果你的「声音」变得太过特殊，而你却不顾及他人的感受，你就会陷入困境。

一位更年期的患者告诉我，她曾经向一位女医生咨询过她的症状。「打个比方，」医生对她说，「你的身体在发生变化。你过去像个梅子。现在你变成了梅子干。」我知道那位医生的意思，但许多人会被她的措辞所冒犯。幸运的是，这位患者觉得她的话很有意思。但是，「声音」是一把双刃剑。由于你将自己的个性用作工具，你就需要足够的自我意识与敏感性，来觉察你给别人留下的印象。你必须认识到，你待人接物的方式可能不会起到你想要的效果。

在我还是曼彻斯特大学的一名医学生时，我曾在一家不孕不育诊所与一名妇产科顾问医师工作过一段时间。他每次问诊时都会解释一些基本医学知识。「人类靠卵子来繁衍后代，就像鸡一样，」他会这样说，「只不过人类的卵要小得多，而且在体内。你明白吗？」有一次，患者认真地听了他的话，但什么也没说。不知为何，医生停下来问她有没有工作。「有，我在这里当大学讲师。」患者答道。「你教什么？」医生问道。「人类生殖生物学。」她说。医生还算有些风度，露出了羞怯的神色，但让人不舒服的是，他又开始滔滔不绝地讲了起来，就像他以前无数次做过的那样。

无论是在妇产科还是平面设计中，「标准」的工作方法是无效的。销售人员知道他们不能在每次推销时都用同一套话术。这种说法很快就会变得不真诚，让双方都无法真正地倾听。你的「声音」不仅在于你说的内容，甚至不仅在于你说的方式。它是你打交道的方式 —— 无论对方是患者、客户、同事还是顾客。这是你与人联结的方式。

专家对「声音」的处理让人佩服 —— 表面之下还有许多东西。我所见过的最老道的全科医生似乎能毫不费力地指出患者的问题。他们不是在展示医学知识，只是在倾听 —— 也许会说上几句话。他们不催促，也不坚持按照特定顺序提问。他们不炫耀。他们似乎能毫不费力地把任何问题弄得一清二楚。然而，如果事后询问他们当时发生了什么，他们的语言会立即发生变化。他们会阐述自己是如何考虑这种或那种诊断的，并思考患者有多大可能性患上了重病。他们会谈到最近阅读的论文，或者他们在考虑把患者转诊给这位或那位专科医生。他们会制订应急计划，采取保障措施，以防出错。然而，这一切都是难以察觉的。对于患者来说，就诊只是一件很自然的事情：一次有帮助的对话。

约书亚与顾客在一起时也会做类似的事情。他很自信，也很有能力，能给每个人提供明智的建议，帮助他们权衡面临的众多选择。但只要透过表象，你就能发现他的知识非常渊博。他不仅是西装设计和制作方面的专家，而且还了解时装和布料的风格与历史。你不一定能看到这一点，因为他只在需要的时候才显露出这一面。

但是「声音」也有阴暗的一面。「声音」有强大的力量，可以隐藏懒惰与知识的缺乏。「声音」的力量使其容易变质或遭到滥用。虚张声势的表演可以隐藏无知，掩盖毫无根据的自信。

如果知识与技能上的不足以花哨的表演来过度弥补，「声音」就会变成魅力或单纯的诱惑力。事实性知识会遗忘，技能会退化。

我在有些资深医生身上见过这种情况。他们的医学知识已经过时，但他们的表演能力却在不断提升。他们个人的魅力掩盖了这样的事实：他们与更广阔世界的进步脱节了。大多数情况下，这种做法不会造成什么伤害，但表面上的专家（医生）与表面上不是专家的人（患者）之间的权力差异，意味着前者通常不会受到质疑。有时他们新知的缺乏会酿成大错，导致严重的误诊。

因此，这里有一个很微妙的平衡。如果你走向一个极端，就只会照本宣科，提供死板的、预先制定好的解决方案，这可能并不能解决真正的问题；走向另一个极端，就会让所有的事情都以你为中心，任性地把自己的个性与表现看作重中之重。专家能在这两种危险之间找到一条出路 —— 既不压抑自己的「声音」，也不过分依赖「声音」。他们会避免过多强调个性，而忽视知识与技能。

### 8.6 既不标新，也不守旧

Neither the first nor the last

One of the benefits of age and experience is the wisdom which allows experts to cast a sceptical eye over the latest trends and fashions. This avoids being swept up in a froth of enthusiasm, and ensures that decisions are tempered by common sense. It makes me think of Alexander Pope's adage in his Essay on Criticism , which was often quoted to me when I was a medical student.

In words as fashions the same rule will hold;

Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:

Be not the first by whom the new are tried,

Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.

Yet it can be difficult to distinguish this balanced, healthy scepticism from being too lazy to learn new techniques or keep abreast of new technologies. It's often said that our world privileges information over knowledge, and knowledge over wisdom. The ability to stay calm, take the long view and be thoughtful about embracing new technologies is increasingly rare and valuable. Level-headed guidance about what to believe is important now more than ever. For that, we need the wisdom of experts – in medicine and everywhere else.

We trust people, not faceless dispensers of facts. It's through someone's voice – their style, their individuality, their capacity to relate to us as individuals – that we decide whether or not to give them that trust. One doctor, one hairstylist, one tailor, is not the same as another.

Experts have a responsibility not to abuse our trust, nor hide behind it to conceal slothfulness, malign intent or self-interest. All these things happen. Close-up magicians can become cheats and card sharps; well-known artists can pass off pieces of shoddy quality because their work is sought after; surgeons can do unnecessary operations to supplement their income. Such a misplacing of true purpose is a corruption of the responsibility of care, as we saw earlier with the surgeons who liked to ‘cut'. This is the dark side of the switch from you to them – a distortion which moves the focus back from them to you. It's an abuse of the power of voice.

Back to Harry and his cough. A few weeks after my time at the GP trainers course, he comes to see me in my surgery; then again a short time after that. I've been thinking a lot about him in the meantime. Something is obviously bothering him, but I can't work out what. I try to think what might lie behind his repeated visits. The next time he comes I try a different tack. On an earlier occasion he mentioned Ethel, his wife, but didn't say much about her. I have a feeling there might be more. ‘You know when we were talking the other day and you told me about Ethel …?' I begin.

I stop talking and wait. In a few moments, it all comes pouring out. It turns out that it isn't Harry's cough that's been worrying him most. It is Ethel, who is bed-bound at home. He's terrified that if something serious happened to him, she'd be stranded and there'd be no one to take care of her. So although in a way he does want to know what's wrong with him, in another way he doesn't. From then on, our conversations are different and we're able to think of possible solutions. In the end, Harry agrees to have an X-ray and some other tests. It turns out he has emphysema but fortunately no cancer. Still, we spend most of our time talking about Ethel, and I think these conversations help him as much as treating his cough.

Going back to those weekends of baroque music, I realized that I didn't have to be a virtuoso to express my voice at the harpsichord. Just as well, as I never will be. In that setting, it was more important to blend in with others, to contribute without seeking the limelight and – to paraphrase Bill Evans – to know that the problem is large, that I have to take it a step at a time and to enjoy this step-by-step learning procedure.

If you've reached this point in your path to becoming expert, you have arrived at a watershed. For a great many people, like me with my harpsichord, this is enough. I'm able to play to a standard that pleases me. If you want to go further, you can take the next step. But moving from here to becoming truly expert may well be the greatest leap of all.

年龄与经验的增长带来的一个好处就是智慧。智慧能让专家用怀疑的眼光看待当下的流行趋势。这样做能避免被虚妄的狂热所裹挟，确保自己做的决定符合常识。这让我想起了我在医学生时代常听到的亚历山大·蒲柏（Alexander Pope）《批评论》（Essay on Criticism）中的格言。

文字与时尚的道理一样，标新与守旧同样荒唐：既不要率先尝试新异，也不要最后抛弃故旧。

然而，要将这种平衡、健康的怀疑态度与懒于学习新技术、不愿跟上技术进步区分开来，是很困难的。大家常说，在我们的世界里，信息比知识重要，知识比智慧重要。保持冷静、着眼长远，审慎对待技术进步的能力越发显得罕见而可贵。关于我们应该相信什么，头脑冷静的指引比以往任何时候都更加重要。为此，我们需要专家的智慧 —— 医学与其他任何领域都是如此。

我们信任的是人，而不是那些面目不明的信息传播者。通过一个人的「声音」（他们的风格、个性，以及作为一个人与我们建立联结的能力），我们才能决定是否信任他。每个医生、发型设计师和裁缝都是与众不同的。

专家有责任不滥用我们的信任，不利用我们的信任隐藏懒惰、恶意与私欲。这些事情都可能会发生。近景魔术师可能变成骗子或在打牌时作弊；知名艺术家也可能用质量低劣的作品蒙混过关，因为他们的作品很受欢迎；外科医生也可能会做没必要做的手术来增加收入。这种动机不纯的现象，是因为「关心他人」的责任心变质了，正如我们之前看到的喜欢「开刀」的外科医生一样。这是「从你到他们」的转变的反面 —— 关注点从他人身上转移回到了自己身上。这是在滥用「声音」的力量。

回到哈里和他的咳嗽上来。在我参加全科医生师资课的几周之后，哈里来我的诊室找我了，他不久之后又来了一次。与此同时，我也一直在想着他。显然他心里有些事情，但我不知道是什么。我试图弄清他为什么多次来访。在下一次他来的时候，我试着采取了不同的策略。在此之前，他提到过他的妻子埃塞尔，但没有多说。我感觉其中有些隐情。「你还记得那天我们谈话的时候，你跟我提起了埃塞尔吗？」我开口说道。

我停下来等他说话。不一会儿，他就滔滔不绝地说了起来。原来哈里最担心的并不是他的咳嗽，而是卧床不起的埃塞尔。他很害怕，如果他生了重病，埃塞尔就会被困在家里，没人照顾她。所以，他既想知道自己出了什么问题，又不想知道。从那以后，我们的谈话就发生了变化，我们能够思考可能的解决方案了。最后，哈里同意做 X 光和其他检查。结果发现他患有肺气肿，还好他没得癌症。尽管如此，我们还是花了大量时间谈论埃塞尔，我认为这些谈话给哈里的帮助，不亚于对其咳嗽的治疗。

回想那些学习巴洛克音乐的周末，我意识到，要用羽管键琴发出自己的声音，我并不需要成为一名演奏大师。当然，我也永远成不了大师。在那种情境下，更重要的是融入集体，在不吸引关注的情况下做出贡献，以及（用比尔·埃文斯的话来说）意识到「问题之大」，意识到我必须一步步地前进，享受这种循序渐进的学习过程。

如果你已经在成为专家之路上走到了这里，说明你已经来到了一个分水岭。对于很多人来说，走到这里就足够了，就像学习羽管键琴的我一样。我的演奏达到了一定的水准，我已经很满意了。如果你想走得更远，就可以更进一步。但是，从这里走向真正的专家，可能是一次最大的飞跃。
