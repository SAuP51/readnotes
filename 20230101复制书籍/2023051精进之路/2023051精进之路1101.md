1101 Passing it on

I'm teaching a group of GPs how to do simple surgical procedures, and I'm having a problem with Michael. It's the early 1990s, I've recently changed from surgery to general practice, and I'm running the first of a series of educational courses. Michael is an experienced GP, but he just doesn't seem to get what I'm showing him. I'm explaining how to hold instruments and tie knots. He seems clumsy, and I can't understand why he can't do what I ask. It's not as if I'm trying to teach him anything complicated – just obvious things that any doctor should know.

Soon after I joined my partnership I started teaching family doctors to carry out ‘minor surgery'. At that time, GPs were being encouraged by the government to do this kind of work. Most of it involved seemingly straightforward procedures, like excising lumps and bumps under local anaesthetic. But often the GPs had little or no surgical experience, so not surprisingly things didn't always go well. Sometimes they didn't send the lumps they removed for laboratory analysis, and skin cancers were missed. Sometimes they made large incisions and struggled to close them, resulting in unsightly scars. Sometimes they chose an inappropriate treatment altogether. Because of my surgical experience, I was invited to develop a training programme for the UK, funded by the government and supported by the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and General Practitioners. Working with the simulation company Limbs & Things, we developed latex models of those lumps and bumps, so the GPs could practise procedures without damaging real people. I also designed a three-day course and took it to centres around the UK.

Like Michael, many of the doctors on those courses really struggled. Though most of them knew far more than I did about general practice, they couldn't seem to do the simplest things with their hands. They used the wrong instrument to hold a suture needle. They struggled to tie a secure knot in a piece of thread. They couldn't use dissecting forceps without causing damage. At first I couldn't understand it. I knew that it wasn't because they were clumsy or stupid or uninterested – far from it.

Then I realized that it was because nobody had ever taught them these apparently straightforward skills. The surgeons they had watched as medical students or junior doctors were so expert they made everything look easy. It dawned on me that there was a kind of knowledge that experts assumed everyone had, but non-experts didn't know existed. Michael wasn't grappling with something simple at all. It only seemed simple to me because I knew how to do it. To him it wasn't like that. There was a huge gap between my understanding and his.

我正在教一群全科医生如何做简单的外科手术，我和迈克尔遇到了一些问题。当时是 20 世纪 90 年代初，我刚从外科转行到全科，并开办了最初的系列教学课程。迈克尔是一个经验丰富的全科医生，但他似乎不明白我给他展示的东西。我在给他讲解用手术器械打结的方法。他看上去有些笨拙，我不明白他为什么做不到我要他做的事情。我又不是在教他做什么复杂的事情 —— 不过是任何医生都应该会的小事。

在我与人合伙开全科诊所不久之后，我开始教家庭医生做「小手术」。当时，政府鼓励全科医生去做这种工作。这些手术大多数看起来都很简单，比如在局部麻醉下切除肿块和结节。但是全科医生通常少有或根本没有手术经验，所以事情并不总是顺利的。有时，他们没把切除的肿块送到实验室做分析，导致皮肤癌被漏诊。有时他们的切口很大，难以缝合，造成难堪的疤痕。有时他们会选择完全不合适的治疗方法。由于我有外太恐民小的大第 11 章传承技艺 219

科经验，所以我被人邀请为英国开发一个由政府资助的培训项目，这个项目也得到了英国皇家外科与全科医学院的支持。我们与医疗模拟产品公司 Limbs ＆ Things 合作，共同开发了这种肿块与结节的乳胶模型，这样全科医生就能在不伤害真人的情况下练习这种手术了。我还设计了一门为期三天的课程，在英国各地的教学中心授课。

像迈克尔一样，很多参加这些课程的医生都遇到了困难。尽管他们中的大多数人都比我了解全科医学，但他们似乎连最简单的动手操作都不会。他们会用错误的器械来持缝合针。他们很难用线打一个牢固的结。他们不会在不造成损伤的情况下使用解剖钳。起初我不能理解这种情况。我知道这并不是因为他们很笨拙、愚蠢或不感兴趣 —— 远非如此。

后来我意识到，这是因为从没有人教过他们这些看似简单的技能。他们在上学或做实习医生时见过的外科医生都非常专业，让一切看上去都很简单。我突然意识到，有一种知识，专家以为人人都懂，但不是专家的人却不知道这种知识的存在。迈克尔根本不是在为简单的问题苦苦挣扎。这件事对我来说很简单，只是因为我知道该怎么做。对他来说并非如此。我和他的理解之间有着很大的差距。

### 11.1 穿越「隐篱」

Crossing the ha-ha

I'll use a metaphor from landscape gardening to illustrate the gap that can stretch between teacher and student. In many eighteenth-century country estates, the large house and garden are set in extensive parkland stocked with animals. The curiously named ‘ha-ha' is a deep ditch between the garden and the surrounding park. Cattle and deer appear to come right up to the flowerbeds, creating an illusion that the house is in the midst of untamed nature. But the animals never eat the flowers – because they can't reach them. Viewed from the park, the sheer, brick-faced vertical wall of the ditch is obvious and unscalable. But viewed from the house, the ha-ha is invisible.

As experts, we are in the house, viewing an unbroken landscape that stretches across the park. When we see a novice some distance away, there seems no reason why they should not just walk a bit further and join us. But the novice is in the park, and from there the gulf to the house is impassable. When I was teaching Michael how to tie a surgical knot, he was in the park and I was in the house.

At this point on the path to becoming expert, you've made the transition from Journeyman to Master. You have passed through all the stages and reached the top of your field. You've become an expert, and now you want to pass on the knowledge you've gained. But it's often much more difficult than you expect. You have to make another transition, this time from doing things yourself to helping other people do them. This is something all teachers grapple with. In my case the subject was surgical techniques, but it's the same when it's a new computer program, a sport or a language. How can you bridge that ha-ha?

Thinking about Michael, help came from an unlikely quarter – the world of music. One day, between those minor surgery courses, I was having a harpsichord lesson with Sophie Yates. I've been learning with Sophie for over twenty years and she's an expert in every sense. She's a distinguished performer who gives concerts all over the world. She's a recording artist with a long list of credits. She often appears on the radio to discuss her passion for early music. And she's an expert teacher.

On this occasion, I was grappling with ornaments in a suite by François Couperin, the French baroque composer. Couperin's writing is all about detail and precision, about the placing of trills and the spacing of notes. Sophie's teaching, too, is all about detail – not vague instructions to ‘make it more expressive' or ‘loosen the rhythm', but specifics I can work with. She shows me tiny changes to timing, touch and finger position that make all the difference.

At the keyboard, I played the passage I'd been struggling with. Sophie listened, then asked me to play the first few bars again. She could tell what the problem was, but I couldn't, so she tried several approaches. She described what she wanted to hear, but I couldn't grasp what she meant. Then she demonstrated by playing the bar herself – now I could see her point and hear the difference, but I still couldn't do it myself. After trying a few approaches without success, Sophie put her hand over mine, made a minute adjustment to the angle of my wrist and suddenly things fell into place – a physical solution that couldn't be put into words.

Sophie had found a way to unlock my difficulty, to identify my problem and help me fix it. To me, this is the essence of ‘passing it on'. Passing it on is a conversation, a dialogue; not a one-way process. Sophie was building on her decades of experience to pinpoint what was relevant to me at that moment. She had to know how to play that passage herself, of course, but also how to convey it to me, how to find a point of connection. It wasn't about her demonstrating something she could do and I couldn't. That wouldn't help me learn. It was about me, her pupil, stuck at an earlier stage along the path. I realized that what I was trying to do as a teacher with the GPs was what Sophie was doing with me as a pupil. Sophie and I had both become experts in our fields, and now we were finding ways of passing it on.

For a long time, I'd seen music as an antidote to work, and it never occurred to me that there might be similarities between learning music and learning surgery. Yet if how you learn, rather than what you learn, becomes the focus, these examples become instances of the same thing – an expert teacher finding ways to help a learner to understand and to do. This communication cannot happen through books alone, or even through images. It takes place at the intersection between your body, another person's body and the physical world around you both. An expert teacher reveals unsayable things by demonstrating, and by highlighting whatever is crucial for you at that moment. A teacher must identify the problem which they and their student are trying to address.

I tried to work out Sophie's secret. Of course, she's gone through the same process as all the experts in this book. She's done her time, carried out her share of boring repetitive work. She's spent years practising scales, learning music theory, perfecting her performance technique, mastering repertoire and researching the history of her field.

In her teaching, Sophie starts by identifying one thing her student finds difficult, and working on that. Her ability to nail the problem is uncanny. Sometimes it's to do with understanding the structure of the music. Sometimes it's a technical issue, like a tiny change to the angle of one hand, a detail of fingering, or even just sitting closer to the keyboard. Sometimes it's something wider, such as needing to choose a different piece of music altogether.

Above all, Sophie listens. Then she translates her listening into action. In our lessons, she notices what I'm playing in a way that I can't, because I'm too close. She registers the details of articulation and phrasing which I miss, because I'm struggling with the mechanics of performance. My focus is on pressing the right keys in the right order at the right time. But Sophie doesn't only hear the notes I play. She notices the spaces between, the places where the music needs to breathe. She pinpoints what I'm grappling with and puts her finger on problems I haven't spotted. Her expert ears hear things I'm not aware of.

Dealing with technical issues is Sophie's starting point with me, because that's what I've framed as my problem and that's where I think I need help. But Sophie has a wider picture in her sights. She notices things that go beyond technical difficulty – things about my confidence and my approach to practice and performance. She guides me across terrain she has travelled but which I haven't yet encountered. I know that she has spent years in the stages I've described in this book, and now she's using that experience to help me.

Alan Spivey, one of my colleagues at Imperial, is professor of synthetic chemistry. He does something similar with the students on his course. They spend a lot of time learning facts and theories. They also learn laboratory skills and techniques by attending ‘practicals'. They have to be meticulous, noticing and documenting what they do in minute detail. Tiny changes can be the difference between success and failure when you're developing a new reaction. But technical accuracy is only part of the picture. As the students become more experienced, they design and carry out their own experiments to create and test novel compounds.

For Alan, being a synthetic chemist is about connecting practical work with an understanding of molecular structure and reactivity. He can zoom in on these structural details, then zoom out to their implications for experimental design. Not everyone can do this. Alan says his students don't always integrate their work in the lab with their theoretical knowledge. He tries to get them to think in the way he does – to think ‘like a chemist' as they move towards becoming research scientists themselves. It's a long process, and not all students get there. Many get stuck along the way.

我要用一个来自园艺领域的比喻来说明教师和学生之间的差距。在许多 18 世纪的乡村庄园里，大房子和花园都建在开阔的草地上，其间还有许多动物。「隐篱」这个奇怪的词，指的是花园与周围草地之间的一条深沟。牛群和鹿群似乎就在花圃旁边，制造了一种房子就建在野外的错觉。但是动物绝不会吃到花朵 —— 因为它们够不着。从周围的绿地看来，深沟垂直而陡峭的砖墙是显而易见、无法攀爬的；但从房屋那边来看，隐篱却是看不见的。

作为专家，我们就在屋子里，观赏着草地一览无余的美景。当我们看到一个远处的新手时，会觉得他们似乎没有任何理由不能再走近一点，到我们身边来。但是新手在草地上，从那里到房子之间有着不可逾越的鸿沟。在我教迈克尔如何打外科结时，他就在草地上，而我在屋子里。

在成为专家之路上走到这里，你已经完成了熟练工到大师的转变。你已经经历了所有的阶段，到达了你领域的巅峰。你已经成为专家，现在你想把你学到的知识传递下去，但这往往比你想象的难得多。你必须做出另一个转变，这次你要从自己动手做事转变为帮助别人做事。这是所有教师都在努力去做的事。我教的学科是外科技术，但对于教授新计算机程序、运动或语言来说，也是如此。你怎样才能在隐篱上搭建桥梁呢？

对于迈克尔，他从意想不到的地方得到了帮助 —— 音乐的世界。一天，在那些小手术课程的间隙里，我跟着索菲·耶茨（Sophie Yates）上了一节羽管键琴课。我向索菲学习已经有 20 多年了，从各种意义上看，她都是一个不折不扣的专家。她是一位杰出的演奏家，在世界各地举办音乐会。她是个唱片艺术家，发布了许许多多的作品。她经常在广播电台上谈论她对早期音乐的热爱。她还是一个专家级的教师。

这次与她上课的时候，我在努力练习法国巴洛克作曲家弗朗索瓦·库普兰（Francois Couperin）的一首组曲里的装饰音。库普兰的作品非常注重细节与准确性，注重颤音的位置和音符的间隔。索菲的教学也很注重细节 —— 而不是像「增强表现力」或「舒缓节拍」这样的模糊指示，而是我可以做的具体事项。她向我展示了弹奏的时机、细节与手指位置的细微变化，这些变化能产生巨大的影响。

在琴键前，我弹奏了那一段我一直不得要领的旋律。索菲听完后，让我再弹一遍前几小节。她能听出问题出在哪里，但我听不出来，于是她试了几种方法。她描述了她想听到的音乐，但我不明白她的意思。然后她自己演示了一遍那个小节 —— 现在我能明白她的意思了，也听出了其中的区别，但我自己还是弹不出来。索菲试了几种方法，都没有成功，她把手放在我手上，对我手腕的角度做了轻微的调整，突然一切都变得非常顺利了 —— 这是一种无法用语言表达的、身体上的解决方案。

索菲找到了一种方法来消除我的困难，找到我的问题，并帮助我解决问题。在我看来，这就是「传承技艺」的精髓。传承技艺是一种交流、一段对话，不是单向的过程。索菲用她几十年的经验找到了当时对我来说最重要的东西。当然，她必须知道如何弹奏这一段音乐，但也要知道如何把方法传达给我，如何找到达成理解的关键点。这件事的重点不在于她向我展示一些她能做而我不能做的事。那对我的学习没有帮助。这件事的重点是，我 —— 她的学生，在学习的早期阶段遇到了困难。我意识到，我作为全科医生的教师时所做的事情，正是索菲对作为学生的我所做的事情。索菲和我都已经成为我们各自领域的专家，而我们现在都在设法传承技艺。

很长一段时间以来，我把音乐看作对工作的调剂，从没想过学习音乐和学习外科之间有什么相似之处。然而，如果你把学习的方式（而不是学习的内容）作为焦点，这些不同的例子就成了一回事 —— 专家级的教师在设法帮助学习者去理解、去做事。这种交流不能仅通过书籍甚至图像来实现。这种交流发生在你与另一个人的身体，以及周围的物质世界之间。专家级的教师会通过示范、强调当时对你来说至关重要的事情，来揭示那些难以言喻的事情。教师必须找出他们和学生试图解决的问题。

我曾试图揭开索菲的秘密。当然，她和本书中所有的专家一样，都经历了相同的过程。她也曾积累经验，做过枯燥的重复性工作。她花了多年时间练习音阶、学习乐理、完善演奏技巧，掌握各种乐曲，研究自己领域的历史。

在教学的时候，索菲会首先找出一件学生觉得困难的事情，然后着手解决这个问题。她解决问题的能力是不可思议的。有时学生的问题在于难以理解音乐的结构，有时则是技术问题，如一只手的角度、手指的细节需要细微的调整，有时甚至只是需要坐得离琴键更近一些。有时问题则更宽泛，如需要另外选择不同的音乐。

最重要的是，索菲会倾听。然后她会把倾听转化为行动。在我们的课上，她会用一种独特的方式关注我的演奏，这种方式是我做不到的，因为我「当局者迷」。她能注意我弹错的音韵和分句的细节，因为我还在纠结于演奏的技术层面。我关注的重点是在正确的时间以正确的顺序按下正确的琴键。索菲不只听到了我弹奏的音符。她还听到了音符之间的间隙，音乐需要呼吸的地方。她会发现我有困难的地方，并指出我没有发现的问题。她专家级的耳朵能听到我没觉察到的东西。

处理技术问题是索菲和我的出发点，因为我认为那是我的问题所在，也是我认为我需要帮助的地方，但索菲的视野比我更宽广。她能注意到一些超越技术困难的东西 —— 我的自信、练习和演奏的方法。她引领我穿过她曾走过的，但我还没去过的地方。我知道她用了多年时间经历我在本书中描述的那些阶段，现在她在用那种经验来帮助我。

阿兰·斯皮维（Alan Spivey）是一名合成化学教授，他是我在帝国理工学院的一位同事。他也是这样教他课上的学生的。他们会花很多时间学习事实与理论。他们也会通过「实践课」来学习实验技能与技术。他们必须一丝不苟，详尽无遗地注意并记录他们做的每一件事。在学习新的化学反应时，细微的改变可能决定成败。但是，技术上的正确只是问题的一部分。随着学生越来越有经验，他们会设计并进行自己的实验，来制造和测试新的化合物。

对阿兰来说，一名合成化学家要把实际工作与对分子结构和反应性的理解结合在一起。他可以着眼于分子结构上的细节，也可以放眼于实验设计的影响。不是人人都能做到这一点。阿兰说，他的学生并不总是能把实验室里学到的东西与他们的理论知识结合起来。他会试着让学生按照他的方式来思考 —— 在他们成为科研工作者的过程中「像化学家」一样思考。这是一个漫长的过程，并不是所有学生都能做到。许多人在这个过程中都会陷入困境。

### 11.2 摆脱困境

Getting unstuck

‘Threshold concepts' are a useful way to think about this process. According to this theory, learning is not smooth but moves through stages, each a threshold to a deeper understanding. It requires a periodic reframing of your existing knowledge and culminates in thinking like an expert musician, scientist, doctor or craftsman, not just doing the things they do. But before that, there is a time when you struggle with ‘troublesome knowledge' – the sort of information that you might understand piecemeal, but can't put together into a coherent whole. Sometimes you might find yourself in a ‘stuck place'.

Some people can stay in a stuck place almost indefinitely. That's what had happened to my family doctor when I was starting out at medical school, who could never remember the names of all those little buggers in the neck. It's what happened to me when I tried to juggle with five balls, as I described in Chapter 3 . Both of us knew what we were trying to do. With juggling, I understood the physics; I knew where my hands were meant to be. But I hadn't mastered the doing. I'm still in that stuck place now, where I understand the elements but they haven't come together. I believe it's far more common than we realize, because people can perform at a high level without full comprehension. Being unable to remember the little buggers in the neck didn't undermine my doctor's ability to care for his patients, but it was a blind spot he had to work around. It's in circumstances like these, when a pupil already has some competence but can't slot things together, that a teacher is invaluable.

For Adrian, juggling with five balls was as easy as three balls eventually became for me. But for some reason I couldn't make the transition he'd made. Partly, this was my own fault. I didn't put in the time that would allow me to coordinate my body. However, Adrian might never have experienced that stuck place himself, and was therefore unable to identify my troublesome knowledge and help me past it. This was what I had found with Michael on the GP minor surgery course. I couldn't understand why he couldn't do what I was showing him, so I couldn't formulate a solution.

Jan Meyer and Ray Land, who developed the idea of threshold concepts, talk about the difficulty of integrating elements which don't yet hang together. Once you cross a threshold and move forward, things fall into place and you experience a different way of knowing – until you reach the next threshold. To do this you need help, and that's where teachers come in. Interestingly, the discomfort of coming to a new way of knowing rapidly disappears after you cross a threshold. That's why some teachers don't seem to understand why their students find things so difficult. The teachers are no longer struggling with what their students are struggling with.

Now that Joshua the tailor has become an expert, he can look back at his teachers and see what worked and what didn't – and then apply that experience to his interactions with his own apprentices. Ron the making tailor, Joshua's first master, was technically excellent but not a skilled teacher. He insisted on mimicry, making Joshua copy exactly what he did without explaining why. Ron had little tolerance for questioning, and took it as a personal affront if Joshua asked him why he did things in a particular way. He was critical without offering support. Though criticality is important, Ron's unwillingness to unpack his reasons meant that Joshua spent a lot of time not knowing what he was doing wrong.

Joshua's second master was Arthur, the cutting tailor. Arthur was completely different. He had a curious mind, and he wanted Joshua to develop one too. Generous with his time, he taught Joshua the foundations of his craft, allowing him to become free and independent. Arthur believed in graduated responsibility, and he only criticized when he thought it would help. Most of the time, he pointed out the positive aspects of Joshua's work. When he did give negative criticism, Joshua knew it was deserved. Above all, Arthur taught Joshua the principles of design and construction, and gave him the confidence to spread his wings.

Sharing your expertise with people less experienced than you is another shift from you to them, though this time the ‘them' refers to learners rather than audiences, customers or patients. Sometimes it's about teaching techniques or procedures, and tackling difficulties that block progress. Sometimes it's about encouraging learners to persevere during those dark times we all encounter along the way. Sometimes it's about helping them cope with the unexpected, recover from mistakes, build self-confidence or decide on a career path. This ability to teach, to coach and to inspire is easy to recognize but hard to define.

Back in my minor surgery courses, I struggled to explain to the GPs what I knew but couldn't seem to put into words. I tried giving lectures, where I described instruments and techniques in words. But that didn't work. Even a demonstration didn't solve the problem. With people like Michael, it was only in the practical sessions that things fell into place. There, I could see what each person was having difficulty with, and figure out how to help. I tried different ways of telling and showing. Often it took a few attempts before I hit upon something that worked.

Many of these doctors had chosen a career in general practice because they hadn't enjoyed surgery as a student or a junior doctor. Perhaps because of this, the surgeons they did work for hadn't ensured their learners understood the basics of operative surgery. Those more senior doctors had already crossed a ha-ha and no longer remembered how confusing an array of surgical instruments – such as needle-holders and artery forceps – can be. These instruments look similar, but they work completely differently. If you pick up a suture needle with artery forceps, the needle swivels round in parallel grooves in the instrument's jaws and you can't get a firm grip or place an accurate stitch. If you pick up a bleeding artery with a needle-holder, you crush the tissue and cause serious damage. Nobody tells you that. They just assume you know. But how can you, if you've never been shown?

In my minor surgery courses, I hadn't been able to convey the knowledge those learners needed. As a result, both they and I started to feel frustrated. Then I tried Sophie's approach. When I saw someone struggling to tie a knot or control a needle, I'd put my hand over theirs and show them how a tiny shift in the angle of their wrist could make all the difference. Once they felt it, things started to make sense.

「门槛概念」是思考这个过程的有效方法。根据这种理论，学习不是一帆风顺的，而要经历不同的阶段，每一阶段都有一个加深理解的门槛。这就需要你定期重构自己现有的知识，学会像专家级的音乐家、科学家、医生或工匠一样思考，而不仅仅是做他们所做的事情。但在此之前，你会在一段时间内纠结于「困难的知识」—— 你可能对这些信息有些零散的理解，但不能将这些理解组成一个连贯的整体。有时你可能会觉得自己陷入了「困境」。

有些人可能会一直待在困境里。在我刚上医学院的时候，当时我的家庭医生就是如此，他总是记不住脖子里的那些小东西的名称。我在第 3 章说过，我曾试图抛接五个球，当时我也遇到了这样的事情。我们俩都知道我们要做什么。玩杂要时，我懂得其中的物理原理，知道手应该放在哪里，但我没有掌握做的方法。我现在依然没摆脱那个困境：我了解各种要素，但各要素无法结合在一起。我认为这种现象比我们意识到的要普遍得多，因为大家可以在没有充分理解的情况下表现出很高的专业水平。记不住脖子里的小东西，并不会影响我那位医生照顾患者的能力，但那是一个需要他绕开的盲点。一个学生已经有了一些能力，但还不能把各种知识融会贯通，在这种情况下，教师是无价的。

对阿德里安来说，抛接五个球就像我后来抛接三个球一样简单。但不知什么原因，我无法完成他经历的那种转变。这在一定程度上是我的原因。我没有投入足够的时间，来协调自己的身体。然而，阿德里安自己可能从没有经历过那种困境，因此不能指出那些让我感到困难的知识，帮助我摆脱困境。这就是我在全科医生的小手术课程中给迈克尔授课时遇到的困难。

我不明白他为什么做不到我演示的东西，所以我想不出解决方案。简·迈耶（Jan Meyer）和雷·兰德（Ray Land）提出了「门槛概念」，他们谈到过整合尚未联系在一起的元素有多困难。

一旦你跨过一道门槛，继续前进，一切都会变得井然有序，你也会体验到一种不同的认知方式 —— 直到你遇到下一个门槛为止。你需要帮助才能做到这一点，这就是教师的作用。有趣的是，一旦你跨过门槛，那种新的认知方式带来的不适感就会迅速消失。这就是为什么有些教师似乎不能理解学生的困难。这些教师已经不再为学生所面临的困境而苦恼了。

裁缝约书亚已经成了一位专家，所以他可以回过头来看看他的老师，看看哪些做法有用，哪些没用 —— 然后将这种经验应用到他与学徒的互动中。制作裁缝罗恩是约书亚的第一任师父，他技术精湛，但不是一个高明的教师。他坚持模仿教学法，让约书亚模仿他做的每件事，却不解释为什么。罗恩很难容忍别人提问，如果约书亚问他为什么要用某种特定方式做事，他就会受到冒犯。他总是批评而不给予支持。虽然批评很重要，但罗恩不愿解释自己的理由，这意味着约书亚在很长时间里都不知道自己做错了什么。

约书亚的第二任师父是剪裁裁缝亚瑟。亚瑟与罗恩完全不同。他有一颗好奇的心，希望约书亚也能如此。他不吝惜自己的时间，把自己的手艺基础倾囊相授，让约书亚变得自由、独立。亚瑟相信循序渐进地赋予责任，才更有利于学生的进步。

他只在他认为对学生有帮助的时候才会批评。大多数情况下，他会指出约书亚作品里的积极方面。在他真的提出负面批评时，约书亚就会意识到他批评到了点上。最重要的是，亚瑟把设计与制衣的原则教给了约书亚，并给了他展翅高飞的信心。

与经验不如你的人分享你的专业知识，是另一种「从你到他们」的转变，不过这种转变中的「他们」，指的是学习者而不是观众、顾客或患者。有时这个过程的重点在于教学技巧或流程，以及解决阻碍进步的困难。有时重点在于鼓励学习者在人人都会遇到的困难时期坚持下去。还有时候，重点在于帮助他们应对意想不到的事情、纠正错误、培养自信或决定职业道路。

我们很容易看到这种教育、辅导和激励他人的能力，但很难给出定义。

回到我的小手术课程上。我当时在努力向全科医生解释一些我知道但难以用语言表达的东西。我试图讲解，用文字描述器械与技术，但那不管用。即使做演示也不能解决问题。对于像迈克尔这样的人来说，只有在实践课中，问题才会得到解决。

在这种课上，我可以看到每个人遇到的困难，并想出如何帮助他们。我尝试了几种不同的讲述和演示方法。我通常需要试过几次才能找到有用的方法。

这些医生中的许多人选择做全科医生，是因为他们在上学或做实习医生的时候不喜欢外科。也许正因为如此，指导他们的外科医生没有确保他们掌握外科手术的基本知识。那些更加资深的医生已经跨过了「隐篱」，不再记得那些乱七八糟的手术器械（如持针器、动脉钳）有多让人困惑。这些器械看起来很相似，但用法完全不同。如果你用动脉钳去持缝合针，针就会在动脉钳的凹槽里旋转，你既夹不紧针，也不能做精准的缝合。如果你用持针器去夹流血的动脉，你就会夹碎血管组织，造成严重的损伤。没有人会告诉你这些。他们只会觉得你应该知道。可是如果从没有人给你讲过这些，你怎么会知道呢？

在我讲授小手术课程的时候，我没能传达那些学习者需要的知识。因此，他们和我都开始感到沮丧。然后我试了试索菲的办法。当我看到有人不会打结或难以控制缝合针时，我就会把手放在他们的手上，向他们展示手腕角度的微小变化如何带来巨大的改变。一旦感觉到了不同，他们就明白了。

### 11.3 两匹斑马招惹了我的猫

‘Two Zebras Buggered My Cat'

Having gone through the stages of becoming an expert doesn't mean you can remember what it was like at the time. Being an expert yourself doesn't necessarily mean you can teach other people. You can't pass on your experience to someone else before they've completed at least some of the steps themselves. And it takes insight, imagination, empathy and humility to put yourself back on the other side of the ha-ha.

I experienced this at the start of my career when I became an anatomy demonstrator at the University of Manchester, where I'd been a medical student. Nobody explained the teaching part of being a demonstrator, so I had to learn on the job. By that time I'd qualified as a doctor and had spent a year in a hospital as a houseman, working flat out to look after the patients on my ward. The prospect of teaching anatomy came as a welcome change. For one thing, I wouldn't be looking after patients, which meant a whole year without being on call. No more getting bleeped throughout the night to re-site drips and unblock catheters.

But demonstrating anatomy was a steep learning curve. The academics in the department assumed I'd ‘just know' how to teach. But I didn't. Every week I'd take four different groups through the same part of the body. Each group of ten students had their own cadaver, and they would spend the morning or afternoon dissecting. Though my own focus was on the surgical exams I was preparing for, I knew that my main role in the department was to teach those first-year undergraduates. Much of what I was going to be tested on in my surgical exams wasn't relevant to them and I had to avoid cluttering up their minds with excessive detail. My job was to ‘demonstrate', to show them what they would need to know as doctors, to be a guide.

Becoming a guide wasn't just about conveying anatomical knowledge or the techniques of dissection. It was about understanding what the students were struggling with. In the process, I developed my voice as a teacher of anatomy. I tried to put myself back in their position. That wasn't too difficult, as I was only one step ahead of them with my anatomical knowledge. So I shared things I'd found helpful, like the colourful mnemonics I'd learned when I was a student. Some of these have stayed with me ever since, like a burr in a hiking sock. Although I'd struggle now to remember the five terminal branches of the facial nerve in isolation (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, cervical), Two Zebras Buggered My Cat has never left me.

I found that one of the biggest challenges as a teacher is deciding what not to point out. It's easy to swamp a learner with long lists, but less is often more. The art of teaching is to find one or two things which need to be improved upon – and which the learner can do something about – then leave the rest for another day. That's what Sophie does in her harpsichord lessons. She doesn't focus on obvious things like fumbled scale passages or wrong notes, because she knows they can be fixed later. Instead, she points out things I haven't noticed.

That's what Arthur the cutting tailor was teaching Joshua too. He wasn't concerned about small-scale glitches, or things that could be easily remedied. His focus was on Joshua's grasp of tailoring principles.

Each of these experienced teachers homed in on a single thing at a time that could be done better. Each of them did it in a way that helped their student move forward and build their confidence. Each of them was demonstrating care.

Much later, I became familiar with the work of Lev Vygotsky, the Soviet psychologist whose theories have had a profound impact on my own approach to learning. Vygotsky died in 1934, and for decades his work remained relatively unknown in the West, but over the years his ideas about social constructivism have become increasingly influential. One of his concepts is the ‘zone of proximal development' or ZPD. The idea here is that any learner comes with things they can already do. At the same time, there are whole areas that are completely out of reach. In between are things they can achieve with expert help but cannot do on their own. That's the ZPD. Here the role of a teacher is pivotal, giving people support when they need it, and having the sensitivity to back off when they are no longer required. Nobody wants someone breathing down their neck while they are practising something they're getting the hang of but which just needs more work. A skilful teacher provides temporary scaffolding, like a skyscraper under construction. As soon as the building is strong enough to take its own weight, the scaffolding can be dismantled.

Sophie was working with me in my ZPD when she was adjusting the position of my hand at the keyboard; she gave me a new insight which I could work on by myself. I was joining my students in their ZPD when I was an anatomy demonstrator, and again when teaching GPs to do minor surgery. Clive, my wise tutor, did something similar when the other doctors and I were watching one another's video consultations in Chapter 8 . Whatever your area of work, having someone who can support you in your own ZPD is essential. And becoming skilled in recognizing the boundaries of a learner's ZPD is part of passing it on.

When Arthur the cutting tailor was nearing retirement, he encouraged Joshua to take on more responsibility. One day, he said, ‘The next new customer who comes in, you can have.' After an initial meeting with this new customer, Joshua arranged an appointment for the next fitting. But then the man came in to explain that he needed his suit to be made very quickly, for an important family occasion. At that point, Joshua expected Arthur to take over. But he didn't. Instead, he said, ‘Well, you'll have to work fast then, won't you,' and left Joshua to get on with it. By gauging the extent of Joshua's ZPD, Arthur gave him the confidence he needed to work under pressure. Arthur was able to let go.

As a teacher, you can't be in control forever. At a certain point you have to hand over; constantly standing over someone doesn't help. You can't keep telling people how to do things, and you can't force them to do things your way. You have to allow your students or the people in your team to get things wrong, to take responsibility for their mistakes. That's how they'll learn. Passing it on requires you to be there when you're needed, and to fade into the background when you're not.

经历过成为专家的各个阶段，并不意味着你能记起当时的情况。成为一个专家并不意味着你可以做别人的老师。如果他们自己没有完成其中的一些步骤，你就没法把自己的经验传递给他们。要让自己回到「隐篱」的另一边，还需要洞察力、想象力、共情能力以及谦卑。

在我职业生涯刚刚开始的时候，我在母校曼彻斯特大学当过解剖学助教，当时我就有过这种体会。没有人向我解释作为助教应该如何教学，所以我必须在工作中学习。当时我已经取得了医师资格，并且在医院里当了一年实习医生，为照顾病房里的患者忙得不可开交。教授解剖学算是一个不错的改变。其一，我不用照顾患者，这意味着不用一整年随叫随到。其二，我再也不用半夜被呼机吵醒，去重新插静脉滴注套管、疏通导尿管。

但是学做解剖学助教很难。系里的学者认为我「只知道」如何教书，但其实我连这都不懂。我每周都要带领四组学生学习人体的同一个部位。每组学生都有自己要解剖的尸体，他们会利用上午或下午的时间解剖尸体。虽然我自己的关注重点是我正在复习的外科考试，但我知道我在系里的主要任务是给一年级的本科生教学。我的外科考试中要考的大部分内容都与他们无关，我必须避免用过多的细节把他们搞糊涂。我的任务是「展示」，向他们展示作为医生需要知道的东西，做一个向导。做向导并不仅仅是传授解剖学知识或解剖技术，还要理解学生的问题。在这个过程中，我找到了我作为解剖学教师的「声音」。我试着站在他们的角度思考问题。这并不难，因为我的解剖学知识只比他们强一点。于是我分享了一些我觉得有用的东西，比如我在学生时代学到的有趣的记忆法。有些记忆法一直留在我的脑海里，就像登山袜里残留的刺果一样。虽然我现在很难单独回忆起面神经的五个末梢分支 —— 颞支（temporal）、 颧支（zygomatic）、颊支（buccal）、下颌缘支（marginal mandi-bular）、颈支（cervical），但我从没忘记它们的首字母组合在一起的顺口溜「两匹斑马招惹了我的猫」（Two Zebras Buggered My Cat）.

我发现，作为一名教师，最大的挑战之一就是决定不指出哪些错误。喋喋不休很容易让学习者不知所措，所以说得越少越好。教学的艺术在于找到一两个需要改进的地方 —— 学习者可以努力的地方，然后剩下的问题改天再说。索菲在她的羽管键琴课上就是这样做的。她从不关注显而易见的事情，如不熟练的音阶或者弹错的音符，因为她知道这些问题可以以后改善。相反，她会指出一些我没有注意到的问题。

剪裁裁缝亚瑟就是这样教约书亚的。他不关心小问题，也不关心能轻易改正的错误。他关注的是约书亚对剪裁原则的掌握。

每个有经验的教师每次都会专注于一件可以改善的事情。他们每个人做这件事的方式，都既能帮助学生进步，也能帮助他们建立信心。他们每个人都表现出了关心。

很久以后，我开始熟悉列夫·维果茨基（Lev Vygotsky）的著作。这位苏联心理学家的理论对我的学习方法产生了深远的影响。维果茨基于 1934 年去世。几十年来，他的著作在西方的影响相对较小，但在后来的许多年里，他关于社会建构主义的思想越来越有影响力。「最近发展区」就是他提出的概念之一。这个理论认为，任何学习者来学习的时候，都有已经会做的事情。与此同时，还有些领域是他们完全不会的。在这两种事情之间，还有些事情是他们可以在专家的帮助下做到，但无法独立完成的。这就是最近发展区。此时教师的角色是至关重要的，即在他人需要的时候给予支持，在他们不需要支持时懂得后退一步。在练习某些已经掌握了窍门、只需要更多练习的事情时，没有人喜欢别人一直在旁边盯着他们。老练的教师会提供临时的「脚手架」，就像在修建摩天大楼一样。一旦建筑物足够坚固，能够承受自身重量，脚手架就可以拆除了。

当索菲调整我的手在琴键上的位置时，就是在我的最近发展区内教学。她给了我一种新的见解，让我可以自行理解。在我做解剖学助教时，以及后来教全科医生做小手术的时候，都是在最近发展区内与学生相会。当我和其他医生观看彼此的问诊录像时（第 8 章），我智慧的导师克莱夫也做了类似的事情。

无论你在哪个领域内学习，有人在你的最近发展区内提供支持是至关重要的。学会认清学习者最近发展区的边界，也是传承技艺的一部分。

在剪裁裁缝亚瑟即将退休的时候，他鼓励约书亚承担更多的责任。有一天，他说：「下一个新顾客来的时候，就由你来负责。」在与这位新顾客初次见面后，约书亚就为下次试穿约好了时间。但到了那个时候，这个人进店就说，他需要尽快做好这套西装，因为他准备穿这套衣服参加一个重要的家庭活动。这时，约书亚希望亚瑟能把这单任务接过去，但亚瑟没有这样做。

相反，他说：「既然这样，你最好加把劲儿，不是吗？」说完，就让约书亚去干活了。亚瑟估计了约书亚最近发展区的大小，给了他在压力下工作所需的信心。亚瑟懂得如何放手。

作为教师，你不可能永远掌控一切。到了某个时间，你就必须放手；一直手把手地监控别人是帮不了他的。你不能一直告诉别人该怎么做，你不能强迫他们按照你的方式做事。你必须允许你的学生或团队成员犯错，允许他们为自己的错误承担责任。这是他们学习的方式。传承技艺需要你在别人需要的时候出现，不需要的时候退到一旁。

### 11.4 地图与向导

Maps and guides

So what does ‘passing it on' entail? What is this final step on the journey to becoming expert, when you become a Master and take responsibility for the learning of others? To me, it's a combination of being a guide, a mentor and a coach. To explain this, I'll use the metaphor of a map.

Throughout your progression towards becoming expert, you need help in finding the way. In the early stages of doing time you need instruction in specific tasks. That's how things work when you're an Apprentice. This is like using the satnav on your mobile phone when you're delivering a parcel in a city. You have to get from where you are to where you're going, and the system tells you how to do that. It doesn't ask you to think, but expects you to follow its directions. A voice in your ear says, ‘In two hundred yards, turn left.' If you follow the instructions closely enough, you will almost certainly get to the right place. But you'll have no idea of how your route fits into the wider landscape. At this point, that doesn't matter – provided you do what you're told, you'll have done what's expected of you.

When Joshua was making pocket flaps, when Fabrice was sweeping hair from the salon floor and when I was doing the bloods, we were all following instructions. We were all using our satnav. Nobody was interested in whether we grasped the bigger picture. They just wanted us to do the tasks they had given us. Our masters would check that we were doing the tasks they specified, but that was all.

Later, as you start to understand more about the work, satnav instructions aren't enough. You need a map. You're developing a sense of where to go, and you realize there are different ways to get there. With a physical journey, you might start with a road atlas that marks out routes schematically. That helps you pick a route as you go from one part of the country to another. These are the sort of maps I encountered as a medical student, setting out the canon I needed to memorize and refer to. But that detailed information about anatomy, physiology, diseases and their treatments seemed out of context at first, unrelated to anything I'd encountered in real life. It was the same with Joshua, whose pocket flaps didn't make much sense until they became part of a jacket.

At first it seemed a morass of information and I couldn't pick out what was important from what wasn't. That's where lecturers, tutors and anatomy demonstrators come in. You need help to check that your route makes sense.

Once you set out, it's helpful to see the terrain in more detail. You move from a road atlas to an Ordnance Survey (OS) map. OS maps show hills, rivers, buildings and fields, as well as roads and footpaths. But although you can plan where you're going, even an OS map doesn't tell you what you'll find when you get there. You'll be dealing with all kinds of things that aren't on the map at all – recent buildings, or changes to stiles and fences. You'll grapple with bad weather, getting lost, becoming tired, and all the other challenges of a cross-country trip. And you'll have to interpret all that as you go, integrating the knowledge from the map with what you find when you get there.

People who make maps are not always the ones who use them, and they don't always give you the information you need. An experienced walker who knows a region well needs much less in the way of contextual detail than a newcomer to the area. That leads to those infuriating sketches that only make sense if you're in the head of the person who has drawn them. If you miss a gate or a stile or take a wrong turning, you're off the map, without the information you need in order to recognize where you are and get back on track.

Guidebooks or instruction manuals can be useful here, but people writing guidebooks often make assumptions about what a reader will know. I read one recently that said ‘cross the next field, heading towards a piebald horse under a beech tree'. The author must have lapsed into an assumption that the landscape he saw that day was fixed and static.

Thinking that other people will know what is in your mind is a mistake that's surprisingly easy to make. It's like those teachers who get exasperated because a learner doesn't seem able to grasp the point. In fact, it is the responsibility of the teacher to recognize and adjust to the level of knowledge and understanding a learner comes with, rather than starting with what the teacher wants to teach. Here, you need more than a map or a guidebook. You need a human guide.

As you move along your path you'll often find that your maps don't work. When I became a GP, most of mine turned out to be useless. As a surgeon, I'd spent years treating patients who had been sorted by someone else and whose problems had been defined as ‘surgical'. Suddenly, as a GP, I was the first port of call. Not only did I have to remember things I'd learned at medical school a decade earlier and promptly forgotten, but I had to find my way in a new landscape.

Sometimes my patients would have a serious condition that needed immediate action. Then I felt on firm ground. More often, though, they had common, self-limiting problems that weren't particularly serious and would settle down on their own. At first it was difficult to tell the difference, and often I overreacted. I mistook straightforward things I hadn't encountered before for problems that needed referral. But a lot of the time I couldn't pigeonhole my patients at all. They'd say things like, ‘I don't know what it is, Doctor, but I just don't feel right', or the classic ‘I feel tired all the time'. I didn't know what the problem was, and neither did they. I struggled to distinguish between diagnostic signal and noise. The maps I'd come with didn't make sense. I needed a guide.

A guide has travelled the route you're on and knows what to expect. They can tell you if you're drifting off the path, and show you how to get back. As a surgeon, my guides were the consultants I worked for, the doctors in my community of practice, and the nurses and other professionals who helped me learn. But although a guide has responsibility for making sure you reach where you've said you want to go, that's where their responsibility ends. Provided you get to your destination safely, their job is over. Deciding what to do when you get there, or where to go next, is not their concern. For that, you need more than a guide. You need a mentor, perhaps even a coach.

So far I've talked about journeys as if the destination is already decided. But as you become independent, moving from Apprentice to Journeyman to Master, you have to make a lot of decisions. As well as moving ‘from you to them' and developing your voice, you have to choose where to go. It's here that you need someone who cares for you as a person. A mentor does exactly that.

That's what I was fortunate to have when I became a GP trainee, and again with Clive, my trainer. That's what Joshua experienced with Arthur, his inspirational cutting tailor. That's what I hear from all the experts I've met. Passing it on goes far beyond providing training in techniques or procedures. Passing it on means nurturing and supporting someone as they move along a path that you yourself have followed.

But maps are never neutral. They present what the map-maker wants to show you, which isn't necessarily what you need to know. A good mentor will teach you to be sceptical about maps and to use your judgement in interpreting them. In his 1977 book A Guide for the Perplexed , the economist E. F. Schumacher describes his experience with maps during the time of the Cold War:

On a visit to Leningrad some years ago, I consulted a map to find out where I was, but I could not make it out. From where I stood, I could see several enormous churches, yet there was no trace of them on my map. When finally an interpreter came to help me, he said: ‘We don't show churches on our maps.' Contradicting him, I pointed to one that was very clearly marked. ‘That is a museum,' he said, ‘not what we call a "living church". It is only the "living churches" that we don't show.'

It then occurred to me that this was not the first time I had been given a map that failed to show many things I could see right in front of my eyes. All through school and university I had been given maps of life and knowledge on which there was hardly a trace of many of the things that I most cared about and that seemed to me to be of the greatest possible importance for the conduct of my life. I remembered that for many years my perplexity had been complete; and no interpreter had come along to help me. It remained complete until I ceased to suspect the sanity of my perceptions and began, instead, to suspect the soundness of the maps.

那么「传承技艺」意味着什么？在你成为大师之后，开始人为其他人的学习负责的时候，成为专家之路的最后一步又是什么？在我看来，这最后一步就是成为向导、导师和教练的结合体。我会用地图的比喻来解释这一点。

在你成为专家的过程中，你需要一些帮助才能找到方向。在积累的早期阶段，你需要在具体任务上得到指导。这就是你在做学徒时的情况。这就好像你在城市里派送包裹，需要使用手机上的卫星导航系统一样。你要从你现在的位置前往目的地，而这个系统会告诉你怎么走。它不会要求你思考，而是要求你按照它的指示去做。你的耳机里会有个声音说：「两百米后左转。」如果你严格按照指示前进，就几乎肯定会到达正确的地方。但是，你不知道你的前进路线与更广阔的环境之间的关系。此时，这并不重要 —— 只要你做了别人要你做的事，你就达到了别人对你的期待。

约书亚在做袋盖的时候，法布里斯在清扫美发店地板上的头发时，以及我在采血的时候，我们都在按照指示行事。我们都在使用自己的卫星导航系统。没有人在乎我们是否了解全局。他们只想让我们完成他们交给我们的任务。我们的师父会检查我们是否在做他们指定的任务，但仅此而已。

后来，当你更了解工作的时候，卫星导航的指示就不够了。你需要一幅地图。你意识到了自己要去哪里，你意识到有不同的路线都可以通向那里。对于现实中的旅行，你可能会先看看道路地图，然后大致标出路线。当你在国内旅行的时候，这样可以帮你选择路线。我在学医时见到的都是这样的「地图」，其中列出了我需要记忆和参考的标准信息。但是书中那些关于解剖学、生理学、疾病及其治疗方法的详细信息，起初似乎有些不着边际，与我在现实生活中遇到的任何东西都没有关系。约书亚也有同感，直到他做的袋盖成为西装上衣的一部分之后，才有了意义。

起初，我接触的信息像是乱糟糟的沼泽，我分不清哪些是重要的，哪些不是。这就是讲师、导师和解剖学助教的工作了。你需要一些帮助来检查你的前进路线是否正确。一旦你踏上旅程，更详细地观察地形地貌是很有帮助的。

你需要放下道路地图，参考地形测量图。地形测量图标出了丘陵、河流、建筑物和田野，以及道路和小径。你要应对各种没在地图上标出来的东西 —— 新修的建筑、改变的阶梯和栅栏。

你要与坏天气、迷路、疲惫和其他越野旅行的挑战作斗争。你必须一边走一边应付这一切，把地图上的知识和你在路上发现的东西结合起来。

制作地图的人并不一定是使用地图的人，他们并非总能给你需要的信息。熟悉一个地区的、有经验的旅行者需要的环境细节信息比新来的人少得多。这就导致他们画的草图非常令人恼火，只有了解这些绘图人是怎么想的，这些地图才有意义。

如果你错过了一扇门、一道阶梯，或者拐错了一个弯，你就脱离了地图的指引，缺乏必要的信息帮助你辨别方位，找到正轨。

此时，指南或操作手册可能很有帮助，但撰写这些指南的人经常对读者的知识怀有一些假设。我最近读到的一本旅行指南说：「穿过下一片田野，走向一棵山毛榉树下的花斑马。」作者一定误以为他那天看到的景色是固定不变的。

以为别人知道你脑子里的东西，是一个人们很容易犯的错误。那些因为学生不得要领而恼火的老师就是这样的。事实上，了解并适应学习者的知识和理解水平是教师的责任，教师不能从自己想教的东西开始教起。在这种情况下，学生需要的不只是一幅地图或一本旅行指南。你需要一个做向导的人。

当你沿着道路前进的时候，你会经常发现手上的地图不管用。在我成为全科医生的过程中，我的大部分「地图」都是没用的。作为一名外科医生，我花了多年时间治疗那些被别人分好类的患者，他们的问题都被定义为「外科问题」。突然间，我成了全科医生，成了患者的第一个求助对象。我不仅要回想起十年前在医学院学过，但很快就忘记的东西，还要在新的领域里找到自己的方向。

有时我的患者病得很重，需要立即接受治疗。那时，我心里反而感到很踏实。但在更多的时候，他们有一些常见的、自限性疾病，这些问题并不严重，会自行好转。一开始我很难分辨两种疾病的区别，而且常常反应过度。我会把我从没见过的简单问题当作需要转介的疾病。然而在许多情况下，我完全不知道怎么给我的患者分类。他们会说「医生，我不知道是怎么回事，只是觉得不舒服」或者「我总是觉得很累」这样的老生常谈。我不知道问题出在哪里，他们也不知道。我很难分辨诊断信号与噪声。我带来的地图没有任何借鉴意义。我需要一个向导。

向导已经走过了你所走的道路，他们知道会发生什么。如果你偏离了正确的方向，他们会提醒你，并告诉你如何返回。做外科医生时，我的向导就是我的上级顾问医师、我实践社群里的医生，以及帮助我学习的护士和其他专业人士。但是，尽管向导有责任确保你到达你说过你想去的地方，但他们的责任也仅限于此。只要你安全地到达目的地，他们的任务就结束了。到达目的地之后你决定做什么，或者接下来去哪里，都不是他们关心的问题。对于这些问题，你需要的不只是一个向导。你需要一个导师，甚至是一个教练。

到目前为止，我一直在谈论旅行，就好像目的地已经确定了一样。但随着你独立自主，从学徒变为熟练工，再变为大师，你必须做出很多决定。除了做出「从你到他们」的转变，找到自己的「声音」，你还必须选择去往哪里。此时你需要一个关心你的人。导师正是这样的人。在我成为一名全科医生培训师的时候，我很幸运能有这样的导师，也很幸运能遇上我的培训师克莱夫。这就是约书亚师从亚瑟 —— 鼓舞他的剪裁裁缝时所体验到的感受。我见过的所有专家都讲到过这样的经历。传承技艺远不止是提供技术或操作流程方面的培训。传承技艺意味着在学生走上你曾走过的道路时，给予他们照顾与支持。

然而地图从来不是中立客观的，它们呈现的是制图者想要告诉你的东西，而不一定是你需要知道的东西。好的导师会教你对地图保持怀疑的态度，用自己的判断来解读地图。经济学家 E. F. 舒马赫（E.F.Schumacher）在他 1977 年出版的《解惑：心智模式决定你的一生》（A Guide for the Perplexed）一书中讲述了他在冷战时期使用地图的经历：

几年前来列宁格勒的时候，我查了查地图，想知道我在哪儿，但我却查不出来。从我站立的地方，我能看见几座巨大的教堂，然而我在地图上却找不到它们的踪影。终于有一位翻译来帮我了，他说：「我们不把教堂标在地图上。」我指着一个明显的标记，对他的说法提出异议。「那是一座博物馆，」他说，「不是我们所说的‘活教堂'。只有‘活教堂'不会被标出来。」

然后我想到，曾经有人给过我一张地图，上面没有显示我眼前看到的许多东西，这种事不是第一次发生了。在中学和大学里，我一直得到的都是生活和知识的地图。在这些地图上，几乎找不到我最关心的、对我的人生来说可能是最重要的东西。我记得许多年来，我一直百思不得其解，却从来没有翻译前来帮我。

直到我不再怀疑我的感知，转而开始怀疑地图的可靠性，我的困惑才开始消解。

### 11.4 出乎意料

Going off-piste

Back with Michael on the minor surgery course, he suddenly sees what I'm getting at. He moves his hand a fraction, and something falls into place. Now he can tie that knot, get that suture tension just right. But he's still finding it more difficult than I expected. During a coffee break I ask him what he thinks the problem is.

He tells me that ever since childhood he's struggled with being clumsy, but he thought it was just how he was. It's only recently that he's had some tests which show he's got mild dyspraxia, a developmental disorder of coordination. It never occurred to me that there might be an underlying physical reason for Michael's problems with handling instruments and tying knots. I realize that passing it on isn't just about telling people things you know, or showing them things you can do. It's about putting yourself in their position and walking beside them on their path to becoming expert. Passing it on is not about me as a teacher, but about Michael and what he needs.

In the final chapter, I'll ask why experts matter to all of us.

回到迈克尔的小手术课上。他突然明白了我的意思。他的手稍稍动了一下，事情就恢复了正常。现在他会打结了，能够让缝合部位保持恰到好处的张力，但他还是觉得这比我想象中的难。在一次喝咖啡的休息时间里，我问他觉得问题出在哪里。

他告诉我，他从小就笨手笨脚，但他认为他就是这个样子。·直到最近，他才做了一些测试，结果表明他有轻度的运动障碍（一种发育性协调障碍）。我根本没想到，迈克尔在使用器械和打结方面的问题可能有潜在的身体原因。我意识到，传承技艺不仅是告诉别人你知道的事情，或者向他们展示你能做的事情，而是要设身处地为他们着想，在他们成为专家的旅途中与他们同行。传承技艺的重点不在于我这个老师，而在于迈克尔和他的需求。

在最后一章，我会提出这个问题：为什么专家对于我们所有人都很重要？
