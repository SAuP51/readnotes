1001 Changing direction

It's September 2014 and I'm at the Art Workers' Guild in London, that remarkable organization I described in Chapter 1 . We're about to begin an all-day event I've called ‘Thread Management'. I've brought together a group of experts who all work with threads. Several of them, like me, are surgeons. One's a vascular consultant who operates on arteries and veins. Another is a cardiac surgeon who specializes in repairing diseased heart valves, rather than replacing them. A third's a paediatric surgeon, used to working on babies and children. Another is a scrub nurse, a key part of any surgical team.

Alongside the surgeons we've got experts from outside medicine. I've invited three puppeteers, who use threads to bring their marionettes to life. There's a fisherman, who uses lines for casting and tying flies for catching trout. There's one of the UK's leading experts in experimental knitting and textile design. And there are a couple of engineers from Imperial, who are analysing threads mathematically to create computer models.

We're all here because of Fleur Oakes, the three-dimensional embroiderer whose ideas of ‘wrongness' came up in Chapter 9 . Fleur had come to a surgical simulation I led that had demonstrated how surgeons join segments of intestine using sutures. For me, the focus had been on showing how the team created an anastomosis in gut or blood vessels, something I'd done countless times as a trauma surgeon. But when Fleur saw that simulation, she wasn't interested in anatomy, or the nuances of injury or disease. What she saw was how the surgical team used sutures and needles. She called it ‘thread management'.

Fleur's never been to medical school. Instead, she studied fine art, fashion design and embroidery. She's an expert maker, and an expert teacher too. When I asked her what she meant by ‘thread management', she said, ‘I noticed you'd got all these threads floating around during that operation. That's what happens with my students too. The first thing I have to teach them is how not to get their threads tangled up. I tell them that a thread should never be longer than the distance from your fingers to your elbow; that you have to pay constant attention to each thread's tension; that you have to make sure the thread doesn't twist up in a spiral like an old-fashioned telephone cable if you're sewing along a curve.'

I wish someone had said that to me when I was training in surgery. As an assistant, I lost count of the number of times I allowed a thread to get snarled up in a retractor while I was ‘following' my boss as she completed a difficult anastomosis. As a surgeon myself, I often got frustrated by the way fine suture material twisted up in a spiral when I was sewing along a curve.

I'd learned my sewing from the surgeons I worked for. I never thought that an embroiderer might be able to help, because I never thought about professional embroiderers at all. At the time I hardly knew they existed. Years later, when Fleur made her comment about thread management, I realized she'd seen something in surgery that had been there all the time but I'd never noticed. She saw thread as a focal point. So we decided to explore this idea with other experts.

That day at the Art Workers' Guild took Fleur's work and mine in new directions. We'd asked all the participants to bring examples of their work and the materials they use. The surgeons and scrub nurse brought instruments, sutures and models of arteries. The fisherman had his rod and line; the puppeteers brought a bag full of marionettes; the textile artist had her spinning wheel; and the mathematicians brought a computer with their modelling software. Seeing these experts demonstrate their skills showed me that looking outside my own field could shine new light on what I thought I knew. Since then, cross-disciplinary exploration has become the focus of my research.

Thread Management transformed things for Fleur too, opening up a new phase in her career. At that event at the Art Workers' Guild, she found herself sitting next to Colin Bicknell, a consultant vascular surgeon. Fleur and Colin hit it off at once. Fleur had brought an embroidery frame and Colin had brought a simulated aorta made of silicon. When Colin demonstrated how he replaced a diseased aortic segment, inserting a Dacron graft with tiny stitches, Fleur immediately felt at home. Her own work with stitches seemed weirdly similar, even though the purpose was completely different.

Colin invited Fleur into his theatre to watch him operate on real patients, and she's never looked back. For over three years, she's been the embroiderer-in-residence in Colin's vascular surgery unit, a role that is probably unique. She's spent countless hours watching Colin and his team, figuring out how to use her skills to help trainee surgeons with theirs. She's watched the surgeons deal with everything you can imagine, from blocked leg arteries to ruptured aortic aneurysms that can kill in minutes. But she hasn't just confined their work to Colin's world. She's invited him and his students to her studio in north London, teaching them how to look, to draw and to sew like artists. She's designed a training programme for helping surgeons build their skills, starting with simple exercises in knotting and embroidery before progressing to complex procedures on fragile vintage fabrics which fall to pieces at a touch. It's uncannily like operating on sick patients whose arteries are as soft as butter or as brittle as clay pipes.

Fleur makes sense of what she sees in Colin's operating theatre because she's already an expert. Let's explore what's happening here in terms of the path in this book.

Fleur has been through all the stages I've described so far. She spent years at art school, studying to become a dressmaker as well as a fashion designer – doing time and learning to use her senses. She set up her own fashion house, designing and producing garments for other people. She got things wrong and had to put them right. In her fashion house she learned to recognize what her customers wanted, creating designs that matched their needs. Like the other experts in this book, she had to make the transition to ‘it's not about you' and she developed her voice.

The 2008 economic crash demolished Fleur's business, so for a while she morphed into a bespoke corset maker, creating a niche which brought together her talents as a designer and as a maker. She didn't abandon the skills she had learned, but turned them into something else. In terms of the previous chapter, she improvised . But although she was good at corset-making, she realized she wasn't cut out for it. She wanted a challenge that made full use of her dexterity and imagination. So, inspired by historic costumes in London's Victoria and Albert Museum, she became fascinated with three-dimensional embroidery. She spent hours recreating Jacobean stumpwork, working at a microscopic scale to create embroidered shapes based on the natural world. Now she's one of the leading experts in this unusual field.

By this time, Fleur was becoming well known, and highly respected as a craftsman and a teacher. She could have gone on doing that for the rest of her career. But in becoming the embroiderer-in-residence at Colin Bicknell's vascular surgery unit, Fleur has taken a new direction. Instead of carrying on as she was in the field she trained in, she's redefining it.

Not many experts do this. Most continue along the path they chose at the beginning. Having gone through the Apprentice phase in someone else's workshop, then honing and refining their expertise as Journeymen, they become Masters. They focus on passing on their knowledge to those who are following the path they themselves trod. This is vital work, not only for the learners who come up through the system, but for the survival of the system itself.

Experts like these continue their work in the way they have learned it. Clinicians look after patients in much the same way as their teachers, even though they take on new techniques. Magicians do magic shows, staying within a well-established way of working while developing new tricks or routines. Bespoke tailors continue making suits based on patterns and blocks that have been handed down through generations.

But some experts strike out in a different direction. These people challenge the nature of their field. Some, like Fleur, find inspiration in an unfamiliar setting that prompts them to think in new ways and from unexpected perspectives. Others, like John Wickham the keyhole surgery pioneer, revolutionize their whole field. These are the ones we'll explore in this chapter. I'll start with Mr Wickham.

2014 年 9 月，我在伦敦的艺术工作者行会，也就是我在第 1 章提到过的那个杰出的组织。我们即将开展一个全天的活动，我称之为「线条管理研讨会」。我邀请了一批与「线」一起工作的专家。有几个人和我一样，是外科医生。有一个血管外科顾问医师，从事动脉、静脉的手术工作。还有一个心外科医生，专攻修复病变心脏瓣膜，而不是替换瓣膜。有 1/3 的人是儿科医生，擅长婴儿、儿童工作。还有一名洗手护士，他们在任何外科团队中都是关键的组成部分。

除了外科医生，还有一些来自医学领域以外的专家。我邀请了三位木偶师，他们能用线给木偶带去生命。还有一名渔夫，他会给鱼线系上鱼饵，再抛投出去捕捉鳟鱼。我们还邀请了一位实验性编织与纺织品设计领域的顶尖专家。还有几名帝国理工学院的工程师，他们在用数学方法分析各种线程，以创建计算机模型。我们都是因为弗勒尔·奥克斯才聚集到这里来的。弗勒尔是一名三维刺绣师，第 9 章提到过她说的「错误意识」。弗勒尔参加过我开展的一次外科模拟活动，该活动演示了外科医生如何用缝合线缝合肠子。对我来说，这次活动的重点是展示外科团队如何对肠子或血管做吻合术，这是我在做创伤外科医生时做过无数次的工作。但当弗勒尔看到这种模拟展示时，她对解剖学、创伤或疾病中的细微之处并不感兴趣。她看到的是外科团队如何使用缝合线和穿刺针。她将这个过程称为「线条管理」。弗勒尔从没上过医学院。她学的是美术、时装设计与刺绣。她是一个专业的制造者，也是一个专业的教师。我问她「线条管理」是什么意思，她说：「我注意到，在手术中到处都是线。我的学生也会遇到这样的情况。我要教他们的第一件事，就是如何不让这些线缠在一起。我跟他们说，一根线的长度绝对不应该超过你手指到肘部的距离；你必须持续留意每条线上的张力；如果你在沿着曲线缝纫的话，就必须确保线不要像老式电话线那样拧成螺旋状。」

我真希望在我接受外科训练时有人能告诉我这些。在做手术助手时，我已经记不清有多少次，当上司做困难的吻合术时，我拿着牵开器「跟着」她，却让缝合线缠住了牵开器。在做外科医生时，当我沿着曲线缝合时，经常因为纤细的缝合材料拧成螺旋状而感到沮丧。

我跟着带我的外科医生学会了缝合。我从没想过刺绣师也能在这方面帮上忙，因为我从没有想过专业刺绣师。当时我几乎不知道他们的存在。多年以后，当弗勒尔谈论「线条管理」时，我意识到她在外科手术中看到了某些一直存在，但我却从未注意到的东西。她把线看作焦点。于是我们决定邀请其他专家一起探讨这个理念。

在艺术工作者行会举办活动的那天，弗勒尔和我的工作走上了新的方向。我们邀请所有参与者把他们工作中的例子和他们使用的材料带来。外科医生和洗手护士带来了手术器械、缝合线和动脉模型。渔夫带来了钓竿和鱼线，木偶师带来了满满一袋提线木偶，纺织品艺术家带来了她的纺车，数学家则带来了电脑和他们的建模软件。看到这些专家展示他们的技能，让我明白了，多看看自己领域以外的东西能让我对自己的知识产生新的理解。从那以后，跨学科的探索就成了我的研究重点。「线条管理研讨会」也改变了弗勒尔的工作，为她的职业生涯开辟了一个新阶段。在艺术工作者行会的那次活动中，她坐在血管外科顾问医师科林·比克内尔（ColinBicknell）旁边。

弗勒尔和科林一见如故。弗勒尔带来了一个绷子，而科林带来了一个硅胶制成的主动脉模型。科林演示了如何用细小的针线插入人工血管，替换主动脉的病变部分，弗勒尔立刻产生了一种无比熟悉的感觉。尽管目的完全不同，她自己用针线的手法却与科林出奇地相似。

科林邀请弗勒尔到手术室里看他为真正的患者做手术，她便对此着了迷。三年多来，她成了科林的血管外科的「住院刺绣师」，这个身份可能是独一无二的。她不知道花了多少时间观察科林和他的团队，思考如何用她的技能来帮助外科实习医生和实习刺绣师。她观摩了外科医生处理一切你能想到的事情 —— 从腿部动脉阻塞到能几分钟内置人于死地的动脉瘤破裂。

但是，他们的合作不仅局限于观摩科林的工作。她也邀请了科林和他的学生到她位于伦敦北部的工作室，教他们如何像艺术家一样观察、绘画和缝纫。她设计了一个培训项目，帮助外科医生提高技能，从最简单的打结与刺绣练习开始，然后再在脆弱的老式纺织品上进行复杂的操作 —— 这些纺织品一碰就会裂开。这就像给拥有像黄油一样柔软，或像陶土烟杆一样脆的动脉的患者做手术。

弗勒尔能够理解她在科林的手术室里看到的东西，因为她已经是专家了。我们从本书里讲的「成为专家之路」的角度来看看这件事。

弗勒尔已经经历了我目前讲过的所有阶段。她在艺术学校里待了许多年，学习如何做一名女装裁缝和时装设计师 —— 积累经验并学习运用感官。她开了自己的时装店，为别人设计和制作服装。她犯过错，也曾不得不纠错。在自己的时装店里，她学会了弄清顾客的需求，按照他们的需求设计服装。就像本书里的其他专家一样，她必须做出「重点不在于你」的转变，并找到自己的「声音」。

2008 年的经济危机极大地打击了弗勒尔的生意，所以她在一段时期内转型做了束身胸衣定制裁缝，开辟了一个小市场，同时发挥她设计与裁缝的能力。她没有放弃自己所学的技能，而是将其变成了别的东西。用上一章的话来说，她在随机应变。尽管她善于制作束身胸衣，但她意识到自己并不完全适合这项工作。她需要一个能充分发挥她灵巧手艺和丰富想象力的挑战。于是，在伦敦维多利亚与艾尔伯特博物馆里历史服装的启发下，她迷上了三维刺绣。她花了许多个小时重制詹姆士一世时期的立体刺绣，根据自然界创作微观刺绣图形。现在她成了这个不同寻常领域里的重要专家之一。

那时，弗勒尔已经很出名了，她在手工艺和教学领域备受尊敬。她本可以在接下来的职业生涯里继续做这些，但在科林·比克内尔的血管外科做「住院刺绣师」的经历，让弗勒尔有了新的方向。她没有按照她在刺绣领域所受的训练继续工作，而是重新定义了工作。

没有多少专家会这样做。大多数人会继续走他们当初选择的道路。在别人的「工坊」里经历学徒阶段，然后作为「熟练工」磨炼并完善自己的专业技能，他们最后成了大师。他们专注于把自己的知识传递给那些与他们走上同一条道路的人。这是一项重要的工作，不仅对于在该专业系统里不断进步的学习者来说很重要，对于这个系统本身的存活来说也是如此。

这样的专家会按照自己所学的方式继续工作。医生照顾患者的方式差不多和他们的老师一样，即使他们采用了更新的技术。

表演魔术的魔术师既延续了既定的工作方式，也开发了新的把戏或套路。定制裁缝会根据代代相传的样板与原型来制作西装。但有些专家却另辟蹊径。这些人挑战了他们领域的基本特点。有些人像弗勒尔一样，在陌生的环境中找到了灵感，让他们从意想不到的角度，以新的方式思考。还有些人像约翰·威克姆一样，彻底改变了他们的整个领域。我们在本章要讨论的就是后者。我会从威克姆先生开始讲起。

### 10.1 锁孔手术的先驱

Pioneers of keyhole surgery

If you have your gallbladder removed these days, it will almost certainly be done by keyhole surgery. You'll have a couple of tiny incisions in your abdomen, be out of hospital the same day and back to work soon after. But it wasn't always like that. When I was training as a surgeon in the 1980s, patients would be in hospital for weeks after elective surgery for gallstones. They'd have large painful wounds that took ages to heal. The procedure I was taught had been standard practice for decades. An educational film from the 1920s shows an operation almost identical to the one I learned as a surgical registrar. Then, almost overnight, everything changed.

The introduction of keyhole surgery in the late 1980s didn't tinker round the edges of what was already there. It was a revolution which turned surgery on its head, and a key figure in that revolution was Mr John Wickham. John died in October 2017 at the age of eighty-nine. He was one of the world's leading surgical pioneers, and a lifelong innovator.

After pioneering minimally invasive (‘keyhole') surgery in the 1980s, he continued to disrupt the medical world. He invented countless new technologies, including one of the first robot-assisted systems for removing the prostate. His ideas reverberate to this day, though until recently his contribution has been unjustly overlooked. I got to know John and his colleagues in the years before he died, and came to realize just how influential this gentle, soft-spoken man was.

John was a urologist. He specialized in treating patients with kidney stones. Like all the experts in this book, he went through the stages of Apprentice, Journeyman and Master. As a young trainee surgeon he gained a wide range of experience, including a spell in neurosurgery. For the first few years after he became a consultant, he performed operations which were standard at the time, making large incisions to expose the kidney and take out urinary tract stones.

He could have spent the rest of his career within this field. But John was restless, impatient with the status quo, and constantly searching for better ways to treat his patients. At first, his innovations took place within his specialty. He designed new instruments, including the Wickham retractor for open surgery which is still in use today. John was passionate about the quality of his work. In the operating theatre he tried to be as delicate with kidneys as neurosurgeons were with brains. He had a deep respect for human tissues and he carried out research into ways of operating on the kidney which minimized damage.

But John's vision went further than that. He told me that when he went to see his patients the day after their surgery, they would be in a lot of pain. An incision the length of a runner bean stretched around their side. John would hold up something the size of a lentil and say, ‘We've got your stone, Mr Smith.' The size of the incision seemed out of all proportion to the tiny stone. To John, this simply didn't make sense. He began to question the need for large incisions, challenging the orthodoxies of the time. Later, he wrote, ‘We still have far too many surgeons who believe that unless you cut a hole big enough to get your head in, you cannot see well enough to perform a proper operation.'

Bringing about change is never easy, and John's vision of a different kind of surgery made him unpopular with some of his colleagues. Surgery in the 1980s was very hierarchical. I know, because I was a trainee at the time and I was on the receiving end. Shit flowed downhill and I was at the bottom. But John Wickham didn't believe in hierarchies, and he wasn't interested in power or status. He wanted to create the best possible experience for the patients under his care, and he built a most unusual team. Decades later, I came to know many of them myself, when I began to research the early days of keyhole surgery.

John was in his eighties by then and many of his colleagues had also retired, but they all vividly remember that time. Toni Raybould (scrub nurse), Mike Kellett (interventional radiologist), Chris Russell (surgeon) and Stuart Greengrass (engineer and surgical instrument designer) talk about how John brought them together to find ways of minimizing the trauma inflicted by surgery. His ideas of teamwork broke new ground.

It was a heady time in surgery. Technology was moving at breakneck speed, and imaging techniques such as ultrasound and CT scanning were revolutionizing how doctors saw internal organs. Fibre-optics and miniaturization made it possible to pass tiny telescopes into body cavities. Lasers were opening up new possibilities for using energy to cure disease. The list seemed endless. With John's encouragement to take risks and be inventive, his research fellows came up with a host of new ideas. Some of these ideas turned out not to be feasible and petered out. Others, like flexible cystoscopy (using a narrow fibre-optic tube to look inside the bladder), have become standard practice.

One day, John Wickham and Mike Kellett made a breakthrough. First, Kellett manoeuvred a fine wire into their patient's kidney under X-ray control, then used dilators to create a tract big enough for a miniature telescope (a ‘laparoscope') to pass. Guiding his laparoscope along the tract, John made a small incision in the kidney, grasped the stone and pulled it out. As he did so, the team burst into a spontaneous round of applause – something seldom heard in operating theatres. The patient went home after a couple of days, instead of needing weeks in hospital to recover. The team had performed the UK's first percutaneous nephrolithotomy, removing a lentil-sized kidney stone through a lentil-sized incision. It was a pivotal moment.

From then on, things moved quickly. In the years that followed, Wickham and his team shaped a field which was evolving internationally. Kellett, already renowned for his ability to visualize anatomy in three dimensions, became increasingly skilled at placing wires and tubes in apparently inaccessible parts of the body. Greengrass came up with engineering solutions to the clinical problems Wickham was facing, such as how to get the best view through a laparoscope, how to zoom in and out, and how to design instruments along ergonomic principles. Raybould integrated these new technologies into the rhythms of the operating theatre.

But John wasn't content to revolutionize his specialist field of urology. After coining the term ‘minimally invasive surgery' (later popularized as ‘keyhole surgery'), he realized that this approach had huge implications for surgery as a whole, though it would be several more years before it became widespread. In a prescient editorial in the British Medical Journal in 1987, he wrote: ‘it seems extraordinary that general surgeons have not yet seized upon the potential of the laparoscope'. Only a couple of years later, the general surgeons did seize on that potential, changing the landscape of surgery forever. Since then, operation after operation has been transformed by keyhole surgery, and John's dream has become a reality.

现在，如果你要切除胆囊，几乎可以肯定你会接受锁孔手术。你的腹部会有几个小切口，当天就能出院，很快就能回到工作岗位，但事情并非一向如此。20 世纪 80 年代，在我还是外科医生的时候，患者因胆结石而接受选择性手术后，要住院好几个星期。他们的伤口很大、很痛苦，需要很长时间才能愈合。我学习的这个手术流程，在几十年来一直是标准操作。有一部 20 世纪 20 年代的教学影片展示过一个手术，几乎和我在做外科住院医生时学到的一模一样。然后，几乎在一夜之间，一切都改变了。

20 世纪 80 年代末，锁孔手术的出现并非对已有方法的小修小补。这是一场彻底改变外科手术的革命，这场革命的关键人物就是约翰·威克姆先生。约翰于 2017 年 10 月去世，享年 89 岁。他是世界上顶尖的外科先驱者之一，也是一个终生的革新者。

在 20 世纪 80 年代开创了微创（锁孔）手术之后，他不断地在医学界掀起波澜。他发明了无数新技术，包括最早的机器人辅助前列腺切除系统之一。他的思想至今仍有影响，不过他的贡献到最近才得到公正的承认。在约翰去世的几年前，我认识了他和他的同事，并逐渐意识到这个性情温和、轻声细语的人是多么有影响力。

约翰是泌尿科医生。他专门治疗肾结石患者。就像本书中的所有专家一样，他经历了学徒、熟练工和大师的阶段。在他还是年轻的外科实习医生时，他在许多领域里都积累了经验，在神经外科也待了一段时间。在成为顾问医师的最初几年里，他曾按照当时的标准做手术，即切开大切口，露出肾脏，取出尿路结石。

他本可以在这个领域按部就班地度过余下的职业生涯。但是约翰有闯劲，不安于现状，总在寻找更好的治疗方法。最初，他的创新就发生在自己的专业领域内。他设计了新的手术器械，包括用于开放手术的威克姆牵开器，至今仍在使用。约翰对于提高自己的工作质量充满热情。在手术室里，他努力像神经外科医生对待大脑那样小心地对待肾脏。他对人体组织怀有很深的敬意，对肾脏手术的方法进行了研究，以尽量减少对肾脏的损害。

但是约翰并不满足于此。他告诉我，他在术后第二天去看望患者时，患者仍然承受着巨大的痛苦。他们身体侧面有一条像荷包豆一样长的切口。约翰会拿着一个小扁豆大小的东西说：「史密斯先生，我们把你的结石取出来了。」

切口的大小与这块小小的结石似乎不成比例。在约翰看来，这根本不合理。他开始质疑做这种大切口的必要性，挑战当时的正统观念。他后来

写道：「仍有太多的外科医生认为，如果你不切一个大口子，大到足以把脑袋塞进去，你就看不清患处，不能好好做手术。」

引领变革从来都不是一件容易的事，约翰对于手术的另类想法，让他在一些同事中不受欢迎。20 世纪 80 年代的外科有着森严的等级制度。我知道这一点，是因为我当时在做实习医生，处在金字塔的底端。「屎往低处滚」，而我在最低处。但是约翰·威克姆不相信等级制度，他对权力和地位也不感兴趣。

他想为他治疗的患者带来最好的体验，于是组建了一个不同寻常的团队。几十年后，当我开始研究锁孔手术早期历史的时候，我自己也认识了这个团队中的许多人。

那时约翰已经 80 多岁了，他的许多同事也退休了，但他们都清晰地记得当时的情况。托尼·雷布尔德（Toni Raybould，洗手护士）、麦克·凯利特（ Mike Kellett，入放射科医生）、克里斯·拉塞尔（Chris Russell，外科医生）和斯图尔特·格林格拉斯（Stuart Greengrass，工程师、手术器械设计师）都讲述过约翰如何把他们聚集在一起，寻找减少手术造成的创伤的方法。他的团队合作理念开创了新的局面。

在外科领域，那是个令人振奋的时期。科技正以惊人的速度发展，超声波和 CT 扫描等成像技术正在改变医生观察内脏器官的方式。光纤和小型化技术让医生可以把微型窥镜放入人体腔室。激光开辟了利用能量来治疗疾病的可能性。这些例子无穷无尽。在约翰的鼓励下，他的科研同事冒着风险提出了许多新想法。有些想法后来被证明是不可行的，于是逐渐消失了。还有些想法，比如软性膀胱镜检查（用细光纤来观察膀胱内部），已经成了标准操作。

有一天，约翰·威克姆和麦克·凯利特取得了突破。首先，凯利特借助 X 光将一根细导线插入患者的肾脏，然后用扩张器撑开一个足够大的通道，让微型窥镜（「腹腔镜」）通过。约翰沿着这条通道操纵腹腔镜，在肾脏上切开了一个小口，夹住结石，把它取了出来。与此同时，手术团队里爆发出一阵掌声 —— 这是手术室里很少听到的声音。患者几天后就回家了，不需要在医院里待上几周才能康复。这个手术团队完成了英国首例经皮肾镜取石术，也就是通过一个小扁豆大小的切口，取出一块小扁豆大小的肾结石。这是一个重要的时刻。

从那以后，事情发展得很快。在接下来的几年里，威克姆和他的团队开创了一个在国际上不断发展的领域。凯利特之前就因为能够想象三维的解剖结构而闻名，他变得越来越擅长把导线和导管放置到难以触及的人体部位。格林格拉斯用工程学方法解决了威克姆面临的临床问题，比如如何用腹腔镜获得最理想的视角，如何放大和缩小画面，以及如何根据人体工程学原理设计手术器械。雷布尔德将这些新技术融入了手术室的工作流程里。

但是约翰并不满足于革新自己的泌尿科专业。在创造「微创手术」（后来常被称为「锁孔手术」）一词后，他意识到这种方法对整个外科领域都有巨大的影响，不过几年之后这种方法才被广泛采用。1987 年，他在《英国医学杂志》上一篇富有远见的社论中写道：「普通外科医生还没有意识到腹腔镜的潜力，这似乎是不可思议的。」仅仅几年后，普通外科医生确实意识到了这种潜力，永远地改变了外科手术。从那以后，锁孔手术技术改变了一台又一台的手术，约翰的梦想成了现实。

### 10.2 创新的大师

Masters of innovation

Not many people can claim to have revolutionized their field in the way that John Wickham and his colleagues revolutionized mine. But many of the experts in this book have taken a similar turn away from the orthodox world they trained in. David Owen, a magician with a parallel career as a barrister, had the idea of using the skills of performing magic to help young people with disabilities. With the support of a hospital charity led by Yvonne Farquharson, David and Richard McDougall (whom we met in Chapter 7 ) became founding members of Breathe Arts Magic. They created two-week summer camps for children and young people with hemiplegia, a one-sided weakness of the body usually caused by birth trauma affecting the brain. Many of these young people were unable to do up their buttons or use a zip, because of their inability to coordinate basic movements. Often, they felt socially isolated, struggling at school and seen as different by their peers.

David and Richard collaborated with occupational therapists to design magic tricks that these young people would want to practise, but which would also help their coordination and build their confidence. The programme was a runaway success. The young people became hooked on magic, practising for hours after every session. As well as making coins vanish and rubber bands hop mysteriously through the air, these young performers developed confidence and social skills through engaging with an audience, using eye contact to direct the attention of those watching. As I discovered when I visited one of the summer sessions, seeing these young people performing a magic trick, then opening a bag of crisps by themselves for the first time in their lives, was an unforgettable experience.

One of the magicians in David Owen's group is Will Houstoun. He, too, has redefined his field. Although Will has been fascinated by magic for as long as he can remember, he only became a professional magician after completing a master's degree in mechanical engineering. When we met Will in Chapter 7 , he was already highly successful. A winner of the European Magic Championships, he had become Magic Circle Close-up Magician of the Year 2015. He had perfected an eight-minute act, performing two shows a night, six nights a week. He had created an experience that audiences loved, making coins and playing cards wink in and out of existence. He told me he was doing what a magician was supposed to do, what other magicians wanted to see being done, and what those other magicians had decided magic ought to be. But despite having become a consummate performer, he wasn't satisfied by magic shows alone. He wanted to create his own form of magic.

At that time, Will was just completing his PhD in the history of Victorian magic. He wanted to challenge his audiences into thinking more widely, and was interested in the relationship between truth and deception. So he developed a new form of magic show, telling stories about magicians from the past. In it, he brings these magicians to life, performing their tricks himself; but as an added twist, Will playfully calls into question the truth of the historical stories themselves.

Will described his purpose like this: ‘This performance may not follow the traditional pattern of a magic show, but in making structural changes I've developed the kind of show I would want to see, one which says the things about magic which I'd like to say.' Will is not conforming to what other magicians do, but reframing what it means to be a magician.

Recently, Will and I have been exploring how the skills of magic can help students of science and medicine think of their work as performance. As magician-in-residence at the Centre for Performance Science, which I lead, Will is exploring how the skills of capturing and shaping attention can help clinicians and musicians in their own professions.

Back to Fleur in Colin's operating theatre. Fleur isn't just teaching surgeons how to sew; she's showing them how to look. By spending so much time with surgical teams, she's noticed things that the surgeons themselves are unaware of. Her artist's eye registers the colour, texture and consistency of the organs she sees. She notices how team members develop awareness of one another's bodies, coordinating their movements around each other and the patient on the table. She sees how some surgeons have an instinctive sympathy with anatomical planes, organs and structures, separating them without causing damage – and others haven't. She notices how surgeons are able to recognize instantly when something ‘isn't right'.

But Fleur doesn't spend all her time with surgeons. Much of her work is with colleagues in the world of textiles, with other lacemakers and embroiderers, and with her students. She wants to talk to them about her surgical projects but she doesn't want to freak them out with talk of blood and guts. In her latest work, she has communicated her insights into medicine through the language she's most fluent in: textiles.

One of Fleur's innovations is her Textile Body. Although it doesn't look anything like a human from the outside, inside its wooden box are layers which are uncannily surgical. Fleur invites people to explore these in the way an operating team would work, separating structures and holding them out of the way with gentleness and care. For the Textile Body, Fleur has chosen textiles that look or feel like human tissues. Vintage lace evokes the skin of an elderly patient. Undoing some buttons reveals knobbly yellow knitting: the abdominal fat. Then come more layers, filmy fabric membranes suggesting the planes of the abdominal cavity. Mysterious structures make you think of nerves and important blood vessels. The idea is not to identify these structures anatomically but to negotiate them without causing damage. The final task is to place a stitch with pinpoint accuracy into a fragile lace structure deep within the Textile Body. To reach it, you must work like a surgeon, separating layers with delicacy and precision. Just as in real surgery, you can't bring that structure to the surface where it's convenient to work on. You have to go to it.

Working on the Textile Body requires surgical skills and surgical sensitivities, but no surgical knowledge. By bringing surgery and textiles together, Fleur has merged two conceptual frameworks, two ways of looking at the world. She has combined the thinking of art and medicine to create something nobody has thought of before. She has broken through the boundaries of her field and taken it in a new direction.

Fleur wouldn't have been able to do that if she hadn't spent years becoming an expert herself. Yet just going through those stages wouldn't have been enough. In order to make her conceptual leap, Fleur needed the opportunity to move outside her field and the insight to imagine how these worlds could be connected.

没有多少人能像约翰·威克姆和他的同事那样，敢说他们彻底地改变了自己的领域。但是，本书中的许多专家都同样偏离了他们所接受的正统训练。大卫·欧文（David Owen）是一名魔术师，也是一名律师。他想到了利用魔术表演的技巧来帮助残疾的年轻人。在伊冯娜·法夸尔森（Yvonne Farquharson）的医院慈善机构的支持下，大卫与理查德·麦克杜格尔（我们在第 7 章提到过他）成了「呼吸艺术魔术协会」（Breathe Arts Magic）的创始人。他们为偏瘫的儿童和年轻人举办了为期两周的夏令营。偏瘫，即身体单侧无力，通常是由出生创伤影响大脑所引起的。这些年轻人中的许多人都不会系扣子、拉拉链，因为他们无法协调地完成基本动作。他们经常感到社交孤立，在学校里困难重重，是同龄人眼中的异类。

大卫和理查德与职业治疗师合作设计了这些年轻人想要学习的魔术，这些魔术还能帮助他们增强身体的协调能力，增强信心。这个项目取得了巨大的成功。这些年轻人迷上了魔术，每次都要练习好几个小时。除了让硬币消失、让橡皮筋在空中神奇地跳跃以外，这些年轻的表演者还通过与观众互动、用眼神交流吸引观众的注意力，培养了自信心和社交技能。在参观一节暑期课程时，我发现，看到这些年轻人表演魔术，然后有生以来第一次独立打开一袋薯片，是一次让我难忘的经历。

威尔·胡斯顿是大卫·欧文团队中的一名魔术师。他也改变了自己的领域。尽管威尔从记事起就对魔术着迷，但他在获得机械工程学硕士学位之后才成为专业魔术师。我们在第 7 章讲到过威尔，他那时已经非常成功了。他是欧洲魔术锦标赛的冠军，在 2015 年成为魔术圈的年度近景魔术师。他能完美地完成八分钟的表演，能一周六天、每天晚上演两场。他创造了观众喜闻乐见的体验，让硬币和扑克出现或消失。他对我说，他所做的是魔术师应该做的，是其他魔术师想看到的，也是其他魔术师认为魔术应该做到的。虽然他已经成为一名完美的表演者，但他并不满足于魔术表演。他想要创造属于自己的魔术。

当时，威尔刚刚获得维多利亚时代魔术史的博士学位。他想挑战自己的观众，让他们拓宽思路，对真相与欺骗之间的关系感兴趣。于是他发明了一种新的魔术表演形式，讲述过去的魔术师的故事。在表演中，他让这些魔术师活了过来，亲自表演他们的魔术；威尔还增添了一丝悬念，半开玩笑地质疑了历史故事本身的真实性。

威尔是这样描述他的目的的：「这种表演可能不会遵循传统魔术表演的模式，但通过结构上的改变，我创造出了我想看到的那种表演，这种表演体现了我对魔术的看法。」威尔不遵循其他魔术师的做法，而是重新定义了什么是魔术师。

近来，威尔和我一直在探讨如何用魔术的技巧来帮助理学、医学专业的学生把自己的工作当成表演。作为我的表现科学中心的常驻魔术师，威尔正在探索如何利用吸引和引导注意力的技巧来帮助医生和音乐家的工作。

再谈一谈科林的手术室里的弗勒尔。弗勒尔不仅要教外科医生如何缝纫，还要教他们如何观察。她花了很多时间和外科团队在一起，她注意到了一些外科医生自己都没意识到的事情。

她艺术家的眼睛能看到器官的颜色、质地和坚实程度。她能注意到团队成员如何形成对彼此身体的意识，如何根据彼此和手术台上的患者调整自己的动作。她能看到有些外科医生对解剖面、器官、组织结构有着本能的同情心，能将它们分开而不造成伤害 —— 另一些人则不是如此。她注意到外科医生能立即发现事情「不对劲」。

但是弗勒尔并没有把所有时间放在与外科医生一起工作上。她工作的很大一部分都是与纺织业的同事、其他花边纺织工和刺绣师，以及她的学生一起完成的。她想和他们讨论她在手术室的见闻，但她不想让血液和内脏吓到他们。她在最新的作品里表达了对医学的见解，她用的是自己最熟练的语言：纺织品。

弗勒尔最新的作品之一就是她的「纺织人体」（TextileBody）。虽然这件作品从外部看起来一点儿也不像人，但在它的木质盒子里，有着极其精确的解剖层次。弗勒尔邀请大家用手术团队的工作方式探索这些层次，将各组织结构分开，轻柔、小心地把它们拨到一边。弗勒尔为「纺织人体」选择了一些看起来或摸起来很像人体组织的纺织品。复古的网眼花边让人想起老年患者的皮肤。解开一些扣子，就会露出有疙瘩的黄色编织物：这就是腹部脂肪。里面还有更多的层次，薄膜代表了腹腔内的面。有些奇怪的结构会让你想到神经和重要的血管。弗勒尔的创作理念不是要让人从解剖学上识别这些结构，而是要在不造成损害的情况下摸索它们。体验者最后要做的一项任务，就是把针精确地扎进「纺织人体」深处的一个脆弱的网眼花边结构里。要找到这个结构，你必须像外科医生一样工作，仔细而准确地分开各层结构。就像在真正的外科手术中一样，你不能把那个结构拿到外面来 —— 当然在外面操作更为方便。你必须向内去找它。

在「纺织人体」上操作，需要外科的技能与敏感性，但不需要外科知识。通过将外科与纺织品结合在一起，弗勒尔将两种概念框架、两种看待世界的方式融合在了一起。她把艺术和医学的思维方式结合在了一起，创造出了以前没有人想到过的东西。她打破了自己领域的界限，将该领域带向了新的方向。

如果没有花费多年时间成为专家，弗勒尔是不可能做到这一点的。然而仅仅经历那些阶段是不够的。要实现概念上的飞跃，弗勒尔需要走出自己领域的机会，并且拥有足够的洞察力去想象这些不同的世界能够如何联系在一起。

### 10.3 池塘里的涟漪

Ripples on the pond

The Thread Management event in 2014 was like throwing a stone into a pond and watching the ripples. Though many of the participants were medical, the focus wasn't medicine – it was threads. Because the Art Workers' Guild is not a clinical setting, surgical suturing became just one instance of expert threadwork.

Many people in that room were much more skilled with threads than me. They had a wider awareness, experience and understanding of how threads behave. That's only natural, since handling threads is a small part of a surgeon's work but a major one for textile artists or puppeteers. And once the focal point was redefined, traditional hierarchies no longer held. We were not discussing whether operating on sick children was more or less ‘important' than fishing or puppetry. Like John Wickham and his team of innovators, everyone contributed something different, yet of equal value.

You have to become an expert before you can change direction like Fleur, John Wickham and Will. There are no shortcuts here. You have to go through those years of hard graft and cope with the ups and downs that make you the expert you've become. You have to earn your spurs. But once you've experienced this process from the inside, you have the skills you need to bring about change. Then it's a question of imagination, of stepping back from the how of being expert to the why ; to the meaning and purpose of your work. It makes you question what being an expert means, why it matters to you and how you can pass your knowledge on. That's what the next chapter is about.

2014 年的「线条管理研讨会」就像我们往池塘里扔了一块石头，然后看着水面泛起阵阵涟漪。虽然很多参与者都是医学工作者，但这次活动的重点不是医学 —— 而是线。因为艺术工作者行会不是一个医疗机构，外科缝合只是专家用线的一个例子。

那个房间里的许多人都比我擅长用线。他们对线的运作方式有着更多的认识、经验和理解。这是很自然的事情，处理缝合线只是外科医生工作中的一小部分，但却是纺织艺术家或木偶师的主要工作。一旦重新确定了活动的焦点，传统的贵贱之分就不复存在了。我们不是在讨论给生病的孩子做手术与钓鱼、木偶戏相比孰轻孰重。就像约翰·威克姆和他的创新团队一样，每个人都做了不同的贡献，但价值是相同的。

你必须首先成为一个专家，然后才能像弗勒尔、约翰·威克姆和威尔那样改变方向。这条道路没有捷径。你必须付出多年的艰苦努力，应对起伏成败。正是这些经历让你成为现在这样的专家。你必须证明自己的能力。但是，只要你的内心深处经历了这个过程，你就拥有了做出改变所需的技能。接下来就是想象力的问题了，从如何成为专家回到为什么成为专家的问题上，去寻找你工作的意义与目的。这会让你质疑作为专家的意义，为什么这件事对你很重要，以及你将如何把自己的知识传递下去。这就是下一章的主题。
