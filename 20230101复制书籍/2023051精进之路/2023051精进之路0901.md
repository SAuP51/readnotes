0901 Learning to improvise

Back to South Africa in the 1980s and another emergency in the operating theatre. This time my patient is Themba, a young man with a small stab wound in the side of his neck near the angle of his jaw. He's anaesthetized on the operating table and I'm about to begin. It's a busy Saturday intake and several theatres are running at once. The other surgeons are on call, operating on their own patients. I've been at Bara for over two years now and I've reached the stage where I should be able to do an operation like this on my own. But, as I discovered when I was operating on Jonas (see Chapter 6 ), the neck can be treacherous territory.

We clean and drape Themba, then I make an incision along the line of his sternomastoid, the muscle that runs from behind the ear to the breastbone. I'm excited and terrified. At the best of times, a stabbed neck is a challenge. You never know what you'll find – the size of the wound and the extent of the damage can be wildly out of proportion. Mentally, I go over what I might encounter: the strap muscles, nerves and blood vessels.

As soon as I start the operation I realize I'm in for a nasty shock. None of the structures I'd learned about from books and in the dissecting room seem to be there. No tidy strap muscles, no arteries and certainly no nerves. Those little buggers in the neck I spent so long memorizing have disappeared. It's all just a horrible squidgy mess, and everything I touch oozes blood. The knife must have punctured a major artery which is now pumping blood into the tissues of the neck and obliterating familiar landmarks.

What if I can't handle the situation, if I can't find the injury? What if other crucial structures have been divided? What if I damage something vital during the operation? What if Themba bleeds to death on the operating table? I've never encountered a situation like this before, so I'll have to improvise. But how?

回到 20 世纪 80 年代的南非，手术室里又出现了一个紧急情况。这次我的患者是滕巴。这个年轻男子的脖子侧面靠近下巴的倾斜处有一道小小的刺伤。他躺在手术台上，已经被麻醉了，我正要开始做手术。那是一个繁忙的周六，几个手术室里都在同时进行手术。其他外科医生也都在工作，为各自的患者做手术。我在巴拉瓜纳医院已经工作两年多了，已经到了可以独立做这种手术的阶段。但是，正如我在给乔纳斯做手术时（见第 6 章）发现的那样，脖子是一个很危险的区域。

我们给滕巴消了毒、盖上了手术巾，然后我沿着他的胸锁乳突肌切了一个口子。这是一块从耳朵延伸到胸骨的肌肉。我既兴奋又害怕。在最幸运的情况下，脖子上的刺伤只是一个挑战，但你永远不知道你会发现什么 —— 伤口的大小与损伤的程度可能远远不相符。我在心里回想可能会遇到的东西：各种带状肌、神经和血管。

手术一开始，我就意识到我会大吃一惊。我从书本上和解剖室里了解到的结构似乎都不见了。没有整齐的带状肌，没有动脉，当然也没有神经。我花了那么长时间记住的脖子里的「小东西」也消失了。只有一片模糊的血肉，既可怕，又滑腻，我触碰的一切都在出血。那把刀肯定刺穿了一条大动脉，那条动脉现在把血液输送到了颈部的组织了，模糊了熟悉的参照点。如果我处理不了这种情况，如果我找不到伤口，那该怎么办？如果还有其他重要的组织结构也被切断了，那该怎么办？要是我在手术中损坏了某些重要的东西怎么办？如果滕巴在手术台上失血而死呢？我以前从没遇到过这种情况，所以只能随机应变。可我该怎么做呢？

### 9.1 随机应变的艺术

The art of improvisation

At this point, you've reached the next cusp on the trajectory of becoming expert. You've done time, used your senses and have a fully operational mise en place. You're a seasoned professional, a Journeyman who recognizes that ‘it's not about you', and you've developed your own style or voice.

In this chapter, we'll explore how you develop the higher-order skills of responding to the complex demands of a rapidly evolving situation – in a word, improvising . Part of this is how you come up with solutions that get you out of trouble. But being able to improvise is more than that. Improvising is what experts do – it's what makes experts expert. And that's across the board: in every field of activity, experts have to improvise.

Years after that operation on Themba, I was in the audience during a gig at the London Jazz Festival when something went wrong. I was listening to a trio – piano, bass and tenor sax – and they were playing new material written by the pianist. They had handwritten sheets on their music stands. The pianist was facing away from the audience, the bass player was at the back of the stage and the saxophonist at the front. Halfway through the first set, I became aware of a brief hiccup in the rhythm, a sense of something unexpected. Almost immediately, everything settled down, and I wouldn't have given it a second thought if the bass player hadn't spoken up after the number to explain what had happened.

Although he and the pianist had played together before, he told us, they had never worked with this saxophonist and they hadn't had a chance to rehearse. Halfway through the number, the bass player noticed that his written part had some extra bars and he was getting out of sync with the others. Realizing that there must be a transcription error, he had to act fast. So he'd looked over to the sax player's music stand, transposed what he saw into the bass clef and continued playing. A combination of swift thinking and sangfroid, rooted in decades of experience.

Though the stakes were very different, the bass player's description took me back to that scary night in Soweto when I was operating on Themba's stabbed neck. It made me think that a jazz band is like a surgical team, encountering the unexpected and responding as a group. Then I started to think not in terms of surgery or music, but of improvisation as a characteristic of being expert, something that could apply to any field. I began to wonder whether insights from other experts might shed light on the excitement and terror of dealing with the unexpected.

When you're talking about jazz and you use the word ‘improvisation', people usually think about the music. They might imagine a trumpet player stepping to the front of the stage, picking up a musical theme and taking it in new directions, responding in the moment to ideas that seem to come from nowhere. They think of improvisation as something spontaneous, effortless and requiring very little preparation. Most of the time that couldn't be further from the truth. That may be what it looks like, but it's not what's going on beneath the surface.

Improvisation is based on years of hard graft. It builds on all the steps I've explored in the book so far. It starts with doing time, using your senses and working within a system. In addition to practising, learning to listen, getting things wrong and putting them right, improvisers have to have made the transition ‘from you to them'. For a musician, the ‘them' is the other musicians they're playing with and the audience they're playing for. At the same time they've developed their voice, the unique style that makes them the experts they are becoming. But improvising isn't an occasional departure from being able to do things properly. Improvising is being able to do things properly. Being able to improvise effectively is a high point of becoming an expert.

When I was watching that jazz band, there was already plenty of improvisation going on in their performance. Improvisation is an inherent part of jazz music – not all of the music is written out; the musicians have to come up with something on the spot. This is where all those hours of practice and theory come in. Knowing which notes in a melody will work with the underlying harmony – and stringing them together into something expressive or moving – can only happen when the production of each note is second nature. The ability to play jazz music, I would say, is having expertise. But what I saw on that day was something even more impressive. When it became clear that the expectations underpinning the improvisation had been broken, the bassist was able to come up with a solution in the moment in a way that his colleagues understood and most of the audience weren't aware of. That, I would say, is being expert.

Some improvisation takes your breath away. On 24 January 1975, the American jazz musician Keith Jarrett played a concert at the Cologne Opera House. It's now seen as a tour de force of improvisation, and has gone down in history as a landmark performance. But the Köln Concert (as it's usually known) almost didn't happen. Jarrett was in the middle of a gruelling schedule of solo concerts, eleven of them in Europe. They were billed as extended improvisations, not variations on something already composed; Jarrett's intention was to create everything he played from scratch. He'd given one of these performances a night or so earlier in Switzerland, and 24 January was supposed to be an evening off. But an opportunity came up for a late-night concert in Cologne and Jarrett agreed to do it.

Jarrett was understandably particular about the pianos he performed on. For this concert, he specified a full-sized concert grand. But when he arrived at the Cologne Opera House, he found an inferior substitute: a small, out-of-tune instrument which was barely playable. Jarrett was livid and almost cancelled the concert. But more than 1,400 tickets had already been sold, and he reluctantly agreed to go ahead. By then, Jarrett was in poor shape. Exhausted by his punishing schedule, tired from travelling, wearing a brace for severe back pain and faced with an instrument he hated, everything seemed to be going wrong.

Finally, the audience took their seats, ushered in by four notes of the Opera's intermission bell. When Jarrett walked onto the stage and sat down at the piano, the first notes he played seemed oddly familiar. They were the notes of the intermission bell, and he used them as his starting point for improvisation – his way into his playing. Listen very carefully to the recording and you can hear the audience chuckle in recognition.

Then, for over an hour, Jarrett held that audience spellbound as he spun the most remarkable web of expressive musical ideas into a coherent, and deeply moving, piece – all the while grappling with that second-rate, under-powered piano. He had to adapt his usual technique to its idiosyncrasies, making it reach the gallery by pounding the keys much harder than he normally would. Technically, as well as musically, he surpassed himself. Somehow all those challenges resulted in something magical. The recording of the Köln Concert became one of the most successful albums in jazz history, selling over three million copies.

Jarrett's remarkable performance captures the essence of being expert. He had decades of study, practice and experience in performing. He had specialized in improvising musically. But on that occasion in Cologne, he did something even more remarkable. He responded to a unique situation, to the stresses of ill health and tiredness, to the inadequacies of the piano and his irritation at finding his requests ignored. Instead of narrowing his attentional focus, he widened it, even to the point of noticing and incorporating the four notes of the intermission bell. To me, that's improvisation of the highest order – an example of true mastery.

现在你到了成为专家之路上的另一个转折点。你积累了经验，学会了运用感官，并且做了充分的、实用的「准备工作」。你是一个经验丰富的专业人士，一个熟练工。你能认识到这件事的「重点不在于你」，你也形成了自己的风格或「声音」。在这一章里，我们将探讨如何培养更高级的技能，来应对快速变化的情况的复杂要求 —— 也就是随机应变。这是你如何想出解决方法、摆脱困境的一部分。但是随机应变的能力远不止于此。随机应变是专家的能力 —— 是他们成为专家的关键。在任何领域都是如此：每个领域的专家都要随机应变。

在我给滕巴做手术的多年以后，伦敦爵士音乐节的一场演出出了一些问题，而我正在台下。我正在听一场钢琴、贝斯与高音萨克斯的三重奏，他们正在演奏这位钢琴手创作的新曲目。

他们的乐谱架上放着手写的乐谱。钢琴家背对着观众，贝斯手在后面，萨克斯手在前面。第一组乐曲演奏到一半的时候，我意识到旋律中有一个短暂的停顿，有一种意料之外的感觉。几乎在一瞬间内，一切都恢复了正常。要不是贝斯手在演奏完这一曲后解释刚刚发生了什么，我根本不会多想。

他告诉我们，虽然他和这位钢琴手曾一起演奏过，但他们从没有和这位萨克斯手一起合作过，也没有机会排练。演奏到一半的时候，贝斯手发现，他的乐谱里多写了几个小节，他与其他乐手不同步了。他意识到这一定是抄写错误，不得不迅速采取行动。所以他看向萨克斯手的乐谱架，把他看到的内容转换成低音谱号的谱子，然后继续演奏。这是敏捷思维与冷静头脑的组合，其背后有着数十年的经验。

尽管我们面临的风险不同，但这位贝斯手的叙述让我想起了我在索韦托给滕巴做手术的那个可怕夜晚。他的话让我想到，爵士乐队就像外科手术团队一样，在遇到意想不到的事情时，大家要协同一致、做出反应。接下来我想到的不是手术或音乐，而是随机应变这种专家特征，这种能力适用于任何领域。

我开始想，其他专家的见解能否阐释这种应对意外事件的兴奋与恐惧。

在谈论爵士乐时，说到「随机应变」，大家通常会想到音乐的即兴表演。他们可能会想象一个小号手走到舞台前，选择一个音乐主题，跟随着此刻不知从何而来的灵感，演奏出意想不到的旋律。他们认为随机应变是一种自发的、毫不费力、不需要准备的事情。在大多数时候，这与事实相去甚远。这也许是表面上的样子，但事实并非如此。

随机应变建立在多年艰苦努力的基础之上，建立在我至此探讨过的所有步骤的基础之上。随机应变始于积累、运用感官、在系统内工作。除了练习、学会倾听、犯错与纠错之外，随机应变者还需要做出「从你到他们」的转变。对于音乐家来说，「他们」是与自己一起演奏的其他音乐家，以及他们的听众。与此同时，他们还要找到自己的「声音」，也就是让他们成为专家的独特风格。但是，随机应变不是一种偶尔偏离行为规范的做法。它就是把事情按照规范做好。能够有效地随机应变，是成为专家的一个重要方面。

在观看那个爵士乐队演出时，他们的演奏里已经有很多随机应变了。随机应变是爵士乐固有的一部分 —— 并非所有的音乐都写在了乐谱里；音乐家必须在当下想出一些新东西。他们花在练习和学习理论的那些功夫，就在这时派上了用场。只有在作曲成为第二天性之后，他们才能知道在旋律中加入哪些音符才能与基本的和声相符，并将这些音符串成有表现力、能感动人的音乐。在我看来，演奏爵士乐的能力就是一种专长。不过我那天看到的表演则更令人佩服。当随机应变的基础 —— 预期被打破时，贝斯手立即想出了搭档们能理解而观众却不知道的解决方案。我认为，这堪称专家。

有些随机应变能让你瞠目结舌。1975 年 1 月 24 日，美国爵士音乐家基思·贾勒特（Keith Jarrett）在科隆歌剧院举办了一场音乐会。在今天看来，这场表演是随机应变的代表，并且作为里程碑式的表演而名垂史册。但是，这场科隆音乐会（现在的通称）差点没办成。贾勒特当时正忙于一系列令人筋疲力尽的个人音乐会，其中有 11 场都在欧洲举行。他们宣称这些表演都是彻底的即兴表演，而不是对已经谱好的曲目进行变奏。贾勒特的目的是从零开始创作他所演奏的一切。他之前在瑞士的一个晚上做过这样的表演，而 1 月 24 日晚上，他本来应该休息。

但是面对在科隆举办深夜音乐会的机会，贾勒特表示了同意。贾勒特对于表演用的钢琴非常挑剔，这是可以理解的。为了这场音乐会，他指定要求使用一台全尺寸的音乐会大钢琴，但当他到达科隆歌剧院时，他却发现了一台次等的替代品：一台走调的小钢琴，几乎不能演奏。贾勒特怒不可遏，差点取消了音乐会。然而 1400 多张票已经售出，他只能勉强同意演出。

那时，贾勒特的状态很糟糕。繁重的日程安排压得他筋疲力尽，旅途让他疲惫不堪，因为严重背痛而戴着护腰，再加上他讨厌的乐器 —— 一切似乎都不对劲。

终于，在歌剧院四个音符的铃声的引领下，观众坐在了自己的座位上。贾勒特走上舞台，坐在了钢琴前。他演奏的前几个音符似乎很熟悉。那是歌剧院的铃声，他把铃声作为即兴表演的起点 —— 作为他开始演奏的方式。仔细听那场演出的录音，你可以听到观众会心的窃笑。

然后，在一个多小时的时间里，贾勒特将富有表现力的音乐灵感汇聚成了一曲连贯、感人的杰作，让观众为之着迷 —— 而他一直演奏的乐器却是那台二流的、音量不足的钢琴。他必须根据这台钢琴的特点调整他惯常的技巧，比平常更用力地敲击琴键，才能让声音传到楼上的观众席。无论在技术上还是音乐上，他都超越了自己。不知为何，所有这些挑战产生了神奇的结果。科隆音乐会的录音成了爵士乐史上最成功的专辑之一，销量超过了 300 万张。

贾勒特的杰出表演凸显了专家的本质。他花了几十年的时间学习、练习和表演。他擅长即兴创作音乐。但是在那次科隆的表演中，他做了一件更了不起的事情。他面对的是一种更特殊的情况：健康状况不佳与疲劳的压力、钢琴的质量不佳以及他发现自己的要求被忽视时的愤怒。他的注意力范围没有因此而缩小，反而扩大了，甚至他还注意到并运用了铃声的四个音符。在我看来，这是最高级别的随机应变 —— 真正的大师级的例子。

### 9.2 随机应变与表现

Improvisation and performance

Improvisation and performance are inseparable. Yet the word ‘performance' makes many people uneasy. To them, it sounds like doing something that isn't real, that is somehow inauthentic – even faking it. I disagree radically. After all, nobody criticizes a pianist for giving a performance of a Beethoven concerto, something they have spent years studying and practising for.

Performance doesn't only happen on a stage. We talk about performing operations, performing procedures and performing experiments, as well as performing concertos and plays. For a musician, an actor or a dancer, performance is what it's all about. But it is just as important in medicine and science. And improvisation is an essential part of any performance.

Improvising is how you apply what you have learned, creating solutions in the moment and responding to what is happening around you. Yet the idea of improvisation, like the idea of performance, often unsettles people. It sounds unprofessional, a solution knocked up on the spur of the moment, like an improvised bookshelf made with a plank and some bricks or an improvised shelter in the rain. But I think it's a priceless skill. That shelter in the rain may have been jury-rigged, but it keeps you dry.

In medicine, improvisation is actually the norm. As a clinician, you're never not having to improvise. You're always applying existing knowledge in new contexts – because you're working with people, every situation is different. There's no such thing as a ‘standard' case of pneumonia or a ‘regular' stabbed neck. Each time, you're dealing with a unique human being. Even when you treat the same person for the same complaint on different occasions, it's a different situation each time. You can never step into the same river twice. You and the river have both changed.

How you improvise is key to becoming expert. It's part of your voice, your style, the way you interact with others. It's how people recognize you for the individual expert you are turning into.

随机应变与表现是密不可分的。然而「表现」这个词会让很多人感到不安。对他们来说，「表现」听起来像是在做一件不真实、不真诚的事情 —— 甚至是在伪装。我完全不同意。没有人会批评钢琴家演奏贝多芬的协奏曲，毕竟他们花了很多年的时间学习和练习这些曲目。

表现不仅仅是舞台上的事情。我们说的做手术、操作、做实验，以及演奏协奏曲和表演戏剧都属于表现。无论是音乐家、演员还是舞蹈家，表现就是一切；但对于医学和科学，表现同样重要。在任何表现里，随机应变都是重要的组成部分。

随机应变事关你如何运用所学的知识，在当下提出解决方案，对周围发生的事情做出反应。然而，随机应变的概念，就像表现的概念一样，常会让人感到不安。这听起来很不专业，像是一种突发奇想的解决方案，就像用木板和砖块临时搭成的书架，或者匆忙搭起来的避雨棚一样。但我认为这是一种无价的技能。那个避雨棚也许是临时搭建的，但它能为你遮风挡雨。

在医学工作里，随机应变实际上是一种常态。作为一名医生，你总是不得不随机应变。你总是要在新情境中运用现有的知识 —— 因为你和人一起工作，每种情况都是不同的。不存在所谓「标准」的肺炎病例，或者「常规」的颈部刺伤。每次工作时，你都在与一个独特的人打交道。即使你在不同的场合治疗同一个人、同一种疾病，每一次的情况也会有所不同。你不能两次踏入同一条河流。你和河流都变了。

懂得如何随机应变是成为专家的关键。这是你的「声音」和风格的一部分，属于你与他人互动的方式。有了这种能力，大家才会认识到你正在成为一个与众不同的专家。

### 9.3 随机应变能力挽狂澜

Improvisation as recovery

Every so often a spectacular recovery hits the media. In January 2009, Captain Chesley Sullenberger was piloting US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320 passenger plane. Soon after take-off from LaGuardia Airport in New York, the aeroplane suffered a bird strike from a flock of Canada geese. Both engines failed. In one of the most celebrated emergency landings in aviation history, Sullenberger realized he couldn't reach any nearby airports and decided to ‘ditch' the plane, bringing it down on the Hudson River. Miraculously, everyone on board survived.

Talking about it afterwards, Sullenberger described how he'd dealt with the situation. Once he had made the decision to ditch, he eliminated distractions by shutting off the radio. Then he gave all his attention to bringing the plane down on water. Like all pilots, he had been training throughout his career for low-probability, high-severity events like this. It also turned out that in the phase of doing time, Sullenberger had other relevant experience, including landing seaplanes. Afterwards, he summarized his achievement like this: ‘One way of looking at this might be that, for forty-two years, I've been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal.' Despite his modesty, I think that's a perfect way of putting it.

Sullenberger's forty-two years of experience allowed him to develop a cumulative knowledge he could draw on at very short notice. When the birds struck, he brought into play those years of doing time, using his senses and working with others. He had the experience to frame the problem and decide on the best option, then create the conditions where he could give his undivided attention to bringing the airliner down on the river. He minimized extraneous demands on his attention, then used his full capacity to focus on the task and achieve the best possible chance of success.

But it's not just in aviation that such spectacular recoveries happen. In 1997, the Portuguese pianist Maria João Pires sat down to play a Mozart piano concerto at a lunchtime concert at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, conducted by Riccardo Chailly. As the orchestra started the opening bars, Pires realized they were playing a different concerto from the one she had prepared.

In the documentary of this extraordinary event, we see Pires in a state of shock. Chailly looks at her from the rostrum, and she tells him, ‘I had another concerto in my schedule.' First he reassures her: ‘You played this one last season.' Then he smiles and says, ‘I'm sure you can do it – and you can do it well.'

And she does.

She gathers herself together while the orchestra finishes the introduction, then gives a flawless performance of Mozart's D minor masterpiece.

Like the bass player at the beginning of this chapter, Pires was able to improvise a solution to her daunting challenge. She had already internalized the D minor concerto and had played it many times before. But being able to reconfigure that knowledge and bring it into play with less than a minute's notice – in public, when the performance had already started – seems extraordinary. Only an expert could do that.

Being expert is not only about becoming good at your core work. It's about being able to respond to things you've never encountered, and having the confidence to go with the decisions you make. Chailly's support played a crucial role in Pires's ability to respond. Like Sullenberger, she was able to save what could have been a disastrous situation with a combination of quick thinking, experience, and a lifetime's hard work and preparation. Somehow, she was able to push away her fear and rely on the skills she had developed over decades.

Few examples of recovery are as dramatic as Sullenberger's and Pires's, but they often have similar characteristics. When Fabrice the stylist cut his client's hair too short as we saw in Chapter 6 , he had to read her state of mind as he decided how to cope with the situation. Much later in his career, one of his roles was to deal with clients when another stylist had made a mistake. Partly this was because of his technical expertise in putting errors right. Even more important, though, was his ability to establish a rapport with a dissatisfied client and come up with a solution that defused the situation and led to a positive outcome.

In all these examples, skill was necessary but not sufficient. How these experts handled their own response and their relationships with other people was key. Sullenberger had to subdue his anxiety and instil confidence in his team by his comportment, while using his skill to land that huge airliner on a river. Pires had to work with Chailly and the orchestra to create an unforgettable experience for the audience. Fabrice had to put himself in his client's position, addressing her concerns without becoming defensive. All of them wanted to achieve the best possible result under circumstances they couldn't have predicted.

每隔一段时间，媒体就会报道一次力挽狂澜的壮举。2009 年 1 月，机长切斯利·萨伦伯格（Chesley Sullenberger）正在驾驶美国航空公司 1549 航班，这是一架空客 A320 客机。从纽约拉瓜迪亚机场起飞后不久，这架飞机就撞上了一群加拿大雁。两个引擎都出了故障。萨伦伯格意识到他无法到达附近的任何机场，于是决定将飞机迫降在哈德逊河上。此举成了航空史上最著名的紧急迫降之一。机上的每个人都奇迹般地活了下来。事后，萨伦伯格讲述了他是如何处理当时情况的。他决定第 9 章学会随机应变 183

迫降之后，就关掉了无线电以消除干扰。然后他全神贯注地将飞机迫降在了水面上。就像所有飞行员一样，他的整个职业生涯都在训练如何应对这种低概率、高严重性的事件。原来，在积累经验的阶段，萨伦伯格也有过其他的相关经验，包括降落水上飞机。后来，他这样总结自己的成就：「我们可以这样来看待这件事，42 年来，我一直在积累相关的经验、教育与训练，就像在往银行里定期、少量地存钱一样。到了 1 月 15 日那天，余额存够了，我可以取出一大笔钱来。」尽管他很谦虚，但我认为他说得再好不过了。

萨伦伯格 42 年的经验使他积累了大量知识，可供他在短时间内加以利用。与飞鸟相撞时，他利用了多年积累的经验，运用了自己的感官，并很好地与他人合作。他有足够的经验厘清眼前的问题，选择最佳方案，然后创造条件，让自己全神贯注地将客机迫降在河面上。他尽可能地减少了分散他注意力的额外因素，然后竭尽全力地专注于这件事情，争取最大的成功可能性。

这种力挽狂澜的壮举不仅仅会发生在航空领域。1997 年，在阿姆斯特丹音乐厅的午间音乐会上，葡萄牙钢琴家玛 （ Maria Joao Pires）（Riccardo Chailly）的指挥下，坐下来开始演奏一首莫扎特的钢琴协奏曲。在乐队开始演奏前几小节时，皮雷斯意识到他们演奏的不是自己之前准备的那首协奏曲。

在纪录片中，我们可以看到皮雷斯一脸惊愕。夏伊在指挥台上看着她，而她对夏伊说：「我准备的是另一首协奏曲。」夏伊先是安慰她：「你上次演奏过这首曲子。」然后他微笑着说：「我相信你能做到，而且你能做得很好。」

她的确做得很好。

在乐队即将演奏完前奏时，她让自己静下心来，然后完美地演奏了莫扎特的这首 D 小调杰作。

就像本章开头的那个贝斯手一样，皮雷斯能够随机应变，找到应对艰巨挑战的方法。她已经对这首 D 小调协奏曲烂熟于胸了，并且之前已经演奏过很多次了。但是，能够在不到一分钟的时间里回想并运用那些知识似乎是非同寻常的能力 —— 更不用提是在众目睽睽之下，表演已经开始的情况下。

成为专家不仅要擅长你的主要工作，还要能够对你从未遇到过的事情做出反应，对你所做的决定怀有信心。皮雷斯之所以能做出反应，是因为夏伊的支持起到了至关重要的作用。与萨伦伯格一样，她凭借敏捷的思维、丰富的经验，以及一生的努力与准备，挽救了可能发生的灾难。她设法控制住了自己的恐惧，依赖自己几十年来培养的技能。

很少有像萨伦伯格和皮雷斯这样戏剧性地力挽狂澜的例子，但这样的例子通常都有相似的特点。我们在第 6 章看到，当发型设计师法布里斯把他顾客的头发剪得太短的时候，他必须揣摩顾客的心理状态，才能决定如何应对这种情况。很久以后，他在工作中的一项职责就是在其他发型设计师犯错之后与顾客打交道。这在一定程度上是由于他拥有纠正错误的专长。然而，更重要的是，他有能力与不满意的顾客建立融洽的关系，想出解决方案，化解紧张的局面，取得积极的结果。

在所有这些例子里，技能是必要但不足够的。这些专家如何处理他们自己的反应以及他们与其他人的关系才是关键所在。

萨伦伯格必须克服自己的焦虑，通过自己的行为举止让团队充满信心，并利用自己的技能将大型客机迫降在河面上。皮雷斯必须与夏伊和乐队紧密合作，为观众带来一场难以忘怀的体验。

法布里斯必须站在顾客的立场上，考虑她的问题，而不能采取辩解的态度。他们都希望在无法预测的情况下取得最好的结果。

### 9.4 是的，而且…

‘Yes , and …'

So far, I've talked about improvisation in a general sense – as the ability to respond to what's around you and come up with solutions to the challenges you find. In theatre, the word ‘improvisation' has a more specialized meaning.

In 1979, the theatre director Keith Johnstone published Impro , in which he describes his work with groups of actors. For Johnstone, improvisation is a skill that can be studied and practised, underpinned by a cardinal principle: it depends on willingness by all concerned – willingness to listen, willingness to respond, and willingness to work together in a creative rather than a destructive way. If a pair of actors was improvising a sketch, Johnstone would insist that every response should start with ‘Yes, and …', building on the other's move and opening up new possibilities. This is the opposite of the ‘Yes, but …' response, which blocks the next move and shuts down possibilities. Johnstone would ask participants to come with a calm mind, prepared to draw on whatever was inside them for the good of the joint performance.

This is far more difficult than it sounds. We are so used to our internal critic making judgements about what is likely to work – and what isn't – that it can be difficult to let go. But this willingness to accept and respond to what another person offers is central to becoming expert. It's another aspect of ‘it's not about you, it's about them'. It shows respect for the perspectives of other people, whether you're an actor or a doctor.

Up to this point in the path to becoming expert, you've been conforming to the framework you have chosen to work in. Your reference point has been the work as it is already done. You copy others, do things as they do. You remain within a system. But now you are questioning the system and redefining its limits. You are using your individuality to do what you think is best. No longer compelled to stick to how other people do things, the onus is on you to do them in the best way you can.

Sometimes this need to think differently is forced upon you, as when I was operating on Themba and his stabbed neck. I didn't want to move outside the system I'd learned, but at that moment the system wasn't working. I had to do something, and what I'd learned didn't help. When you're out of your depth, you have to think for yourself or something bad will happen.

In the performing arts, improvisation isn't the exclusive province of jazz or theatre. Far from it. Improvisation in classical music was highly prized for centuries. The ability to sway the ear in gentle undulation, to use C. P. E. Bach's words, was all about responding to the moment and adapting your performance accordingly. Now there is a resurgence of interest in this concept. David Dolan, Professor of Classical Improvisation at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama, explained it to me like this: ‘Until a little over a century ago, all musicians were expected to include improvisational elements in their performances. Every time they played a repeat passage it would be different. Now, they are assessed on how closely they stick to what is written; how "accurately" they play the notes, rhythm and dynamics specified on the page. That squeezes out their ability to improvise.' For Dolan, the true art is to fully internalize the structure of the music you're playing, then use it as a point of departure you return to as you create fresh interpretations of what you already know. It made me think of Bill Evans the jazz pianist, alone in his garage, analysing his technique for month after painstaking month.

There is a world of difference between playing the notes ‘correctly' – that is to say, as written – and playing them as you want them to be heard. As a musician, you are not re-enacting something you've practised and perfected in isolation, but entering a dialogue. A piece of music only comes to life when you go beyond what is written on the page, when you breathe your personality into it as you're playing.

It's the same with any performance. To do it well, you have to understand the underlying structure, the essential architecture of your work. When you perform, you are connecting that structure with your own emotional world and that of your audience. Magicians, for instance, have to deal with the occasional slip of a finger, or cope with an audience member who forgets which card they chose. There's always an element of unpredictability in performance, always the need to bring your skills together in the moment.

Of course, there is a difference between the improvisational flexibility that brings a piece of written music to life during performance, and the improvisation that happens independently of existing repertoire. But in both forms you have to remain alert, to listen attentively to what is happening around you, and always respond with Johnstone's ‘Yes, and …'

Just like playing jazz, being a doctor depends on improvisation, especially if you're a GP. Each encounter with a patient is unique and unpredictable, yet it takes place within a canon of medical knowledge and skill you've spent years acquiring – your equivalent of a trumpet player's scales and techniques. This canon provides a safety net which gives you the freedom to go in unexpected directions. As an inexperienced clinician, you may be reluctant to start a conversation that could lead into areas you don't feel competent to deal with, or to move outside your textbook knowledge. Later on, you develop the confidence to ask different questions, to probe a little, to risk discomfort. If you try to force a consultation to stay within rigid lines, patients will feel frog-marched. You may be responding to what you want the problem to be because you know how to treat it, rather than finding out what that problem actually is. Instead, you have to listen carefully, then take each part of the conversation forward with a ‘Yes, and …' This means taking risks.

Those skills you built up through doing time, becoming familiar with the materiality of your craft, and learning to recognize the nature of thin materials and their imminent collapse – all these have to be present. You can't improvise without them. But you don't have to show them. The more expert the expert, the less you see what they've had to do to get there. As Bill Evans the jazz icon pointed out and we saw in the previous chapter, the danger comes if a learner tries to mimic what an expert does without having gone through those years of graft. In medicine, for example, you can easily mistake the smoothness of an expert's improvised performance for a cosy chat. You might think you could do that too. Very soon, you would find you can't.

到目前为止，我讲的都是一般意义上的随机应变 —— 一种对周围发生的事情做出反应，并设法解决你面临的挑战的能力。

在手术室里，「随机应变」这个词有一种更特殊的含义。

1979 年，戏剧导演基思·约翰斯通（Keith Johnstone）出版了《即兴》（Impro）一书，他在书中讲述了自己与几批演员合

作的经历。对约翰斯通来说，随机应变是一种可以学习和练习的技能，这种技能的基本原则是：它取决于所有相关的意愿 —— 倾听、回应的意愿，以及以创造性而非破坏性的方式合作的意愿。如果两名演员正在即兴创作一个小品，约翰斯通会要求他们每句回应的台词都以「是的，而且……」开头 —— 以对方的表演为基础，开拓新的可能性。这与「是的，但是……」的反应截然相反。这种回答会妨碍接下来的行动，减少可能性。约翰斯通要求参与者保持冷静的头脑，准备运用自己内心的任何感受来合作表演。

这实际上比听起来要难得多。我们内心里有一个批评家，总会评判哪些办法可行 —— 哪些不可行。我们已经习惯于听从这个批评家的声音了，所以很难放下这种先入之见。然而，这种接受与回应他人提议的意愿，对成为专家而言十分重要。这是「重点不在于你，而在于他们」的另一个方面。无论你是演员还是医生，这种行为都体现了对他人观点的尊重。

在成为专家的旅途上，你一直都在遵循你所选择的领域里的工作框架。你一直参考的是已经完成的工作。你模仿他人，按照他们的做法去做事。你一直停留在一个系统里。但你此时在质疑这个系统，重新划定它的边界。你在凭借自己的个性，做出你认为的最佳选择。你不再必须遵循别人的做事方式，你有责任去用最好的方式做事。

有时，这种思维方式的改变是被迫的，就像我在给滕巴被刺伤的脖子动手术时一样。我并不想离开我熟知的系统，但那套系统在当时并不管用。我必须采取行动，而我所学的东西却派不上用场。当你力不从心时，你就必须独立思考，否则糟糕的事情就会发生。

在表演艺术里，即兴表演并不是爵士乐和戏剧的专利。事实远非如此。几个世纪以来，即兴表演在古典音乐里一直受到高度重视。用 C.P.E. 巴赫的话来说，用轻柔、顿挫的乐音打动人耳的能力，完全取决于表演者对当下时刻做出反应并相应地调整自己的表演。现在，人们对这一概念又重新燃起了兴趣。

伦敦市政厅音乐及戏剧学院古典即兴演奏系教授大卫·多兰（David Dolan）这样解释道：「直到一个多世纪以前，大家认为所有音乐家都应该在表演中加入即兴元素。每次他们演奏一段重复的音乐，都会有所不同。现在，对音乐家的评估标准变成了他们对既定乐谱的忠实程度，也就是他们演奏乐谱上特定音符、节奏和力度的‘准确'程度。这样就打压了他们即兴演奏的能力。」在多兰看来，真正的艺术是完全内化你所演奏的音乐结构，然后将其作为一个出发点。在你对你熟知的东西做出新的诠释之后，你会回到这个出发点。这种观点让我想起了爵士乐钢琴家比尔·埃文斯，独自一人待在车库里，连续数月艰苦努力，分析自己的演奏技术。

「正确」地弹奏音符（也就是说，按照乐谱上弹）与弹奏出你想要传达的信息之间有着天壤之别。作为一名音乐家，你不是在重现你独自练习过、完善过的东西，而是在进行一段对话。只有超越乐谱上所写的东西，把自己的个性注入你所演奏的东西，音乐才会具有生命力。

对于任何需要表现的事情来说都是如此。要做好这件事，你就必须理解其底层结构，即工作的基本架构。你在工作的时候，就是在这个结构与你和受众的情感世界之间建立联结。例如，魔术师必须应对手指间的偶然失误、忘记选择了哪张扑克的观众。表演中总有不可预测的因素，总是需要你在当下综合运用各项技能。

当然，在表演中把一段写好的音乐演奏得饱含生命力所需的随机应变的灵活性，与完全独立于既有曲目的即兴创作是有区别的。但在这两种情况下，你都必须保持专注，用心倾听周围发生的事情，并始终以约翰斯通所说的「是的，而且……」的态度做出回应。

就像演奏爵士乐一样，做医生也需要随机应变，尤其是在你是全科医生的情况下。每次接待患者都是独特的、不可预测的经历，但这些经历不会超出你多年来习得的医学知识与技能 —— 相当于小号手对音阶的掌握与演奏技巧。这些标准化的知识和技能提供了一种保障，让你能够自由地朝着意料之外的方向探索。如果你是一个缺乏经验的医生，你就可能不愿意谈及你觉得自己没有能力应对的领域，或者超出课本知识的话题。

后来，你的自信会逐渐增长，你也能够询问不同的问题，稍做探索，承担不舒服的风险。如果你试图把问诊限制在严格的范围之内，患者就会感到你在强迫他。你可能会对你想要的问题做出回应，而不去发现真正的问题是什么，因为你知道如何治疗前者。你不应如此，而是必须仔细倾听，然后用「是的，而且……」来推进对话的每一个部分。这意味着承担风险。

这些技能是你通过积累经验、熟悉工作对象、了解脆弱工作对象的性质以及它何时会濒临崩溃而习得的 —— 你需要完成所有这些步骤。没有这些步骤，你就不能随机应变。但是你不一定要表现出来。专家越是专业，你就越难以看出他们走到现在这一步所付出的努力。正如传奇爵士音乐家比尔·埃文斯所说，也正如我们在上一章所看到的，如果一个学习者试图模仿专家的行为，却没有专家多年的艰苦努力，他就会陷入危险的境地。例如，在医学工作中，你很容易把专家轻松自如的随机应变看作一次愉快的交谈。你可能以为自己也能做到这一点。

很快你就会发现你做不到。

### 9.5 风险工艺

The workmanship of risk

Joshua the tailor is an expert improviser, a master of the unexpected. Soon after he set up as an independent tailor, he took on a customer who didn't know what he wanted. Joshua said something like this: ‘If you let me design and make you a jacket, I can't tell you exactly what it will look like or even how long it will take. But I can tell you it will be the best jacket you've ever had.'

Many people would have felt uneasy at that point, but this client was willing to go with it. Joshua was as good as his word, the jacket was superb and the customer loved it. Part of that contract involved a willingness by both parties to live with uncertainty while the jacket was being made. It's what David Pye was talking about when he contrasted the workmanship of certainty and the workmanship of risk. I have found this a useful distinction, but it needs some explanation.

Pye was a well-known furniture-maker and Professor of Furniture Design at the Royal College of Art in London. In 1968, he published his influential book The Nature and Art of Workmanship . He begins with a definition:

If I must ascribe a meaning to the word craftsmanship, I shall say as a first approximation that it means simply workmanship using any kind of technique or apparatus, in which the quality of the result is not predetermined, but depends on the judgement, dexterity and care which the maker exercises as he works. The essential idea is that the quality of the result is continually at risk during the process of making; and so I shall call this kind of workmanship ‘The workmanship of risk': an uncouth phrase but at least descriptive.

It may be mentioned in passing that in workmanship the care counts for more than the judgement and dexterity; though care may well become habitual and unconscious.

Pye goes on:

With the workmanship of risk we may contrast the workmanship of certainty, always to be found in quantity production, and found in its pure state in full automation. In workmanship of this sort the quality of the result is exactly predetermined before a single saleable thing is made … The most typical and familiar example of the workmanship of risk is writing with a pen, and of the workmanship of certainty, modern printing … in principle the distinction between the two different kinds of workmanship is clear and turns on the question: ‘Is the result predetermined and unalterable once production begins?'

Pye's example from the 1960s may seem odd to modern readers, when handwriting is in decline and printing has become digital. Nevertheless, his point is clear. His emphasis on ‘any kind of technique or apparatus' shows that he is not thinking only of traditional techniques of making, but is looking ahead to new technologies as they emerge. And Pye is not talking of the risk of poor quality. Instead he is talking about inherent uncertainty, the inability to specify in advance exactly what will happen. The risk is to the predictability of the result, not to those using or experiencing it.

All the experts I describe in this book deal in the workmanship of risk. A surgical operation, a bespoke suit, a clinical consultation, a magic show, a stone carving, a musical performance, a hairstyle – the result is not predetermined and unalterable in any of them. They all contain uncertainty.

To the modern reader, the word ‘risk' has other resonances, suggesting the probability of danger to ourselves or others, of financial consequences or threats to public safety. Of course, the two notions of risk overlap, especially when human beings are concerned. When working with people, nothing can ever be certain. Thus Pye highlights judgement, dexterity and care, with care counting for more than the other two.

For all his old-fashioned terminology, Pye's ideas ring true to me – and he crystallizes something crucial. A necessary uncertainty runs through expert work. As you gain experience, you have to accept and deal with that. That's why the ability to improvise, to come up with new solutions, is critical. As a surgeon, I came to realize that all I could know for certain before starting an operation was that there were things I couldn't know in advance. It might be the details of the injury or the presence of an anatomical variation. It might be how that patient's organs and tissues would behave, or how they would hold sutures. It might be how much bleeding I'd encounter, how tissue planes might be stuck down or obliterated because of previous surgery or infection. I couldn't tell beforehand which structures would be thin materials on the verge of collapse.

It was during this not-knowing that I needed the confidence and the skill that would allow me to improvise. I might not be able to tell in advance what I was going to find, but I had to feel I could deal with it.

裁缝约书亚是一个随机应变的专家，一个让人出乎意料的大师。他独立经营裁缝店后不久，就接待了一位不知道自己想要什么的顾客。约书亚是这样说的：「如果你让我给你设计并制作一件西装上衣，我不能准确地告诉你成品是什么样子，甚至不能告诉你需要多长时间。但我能告诉你的是，这将是你拥有过的最棒的西装上衣。」

许多人在这时都会感到不安，但这位客人却愿意接受。约书亚说到做到，那件上衣棒极了，顾客很喜欢。他们的约定要求双方都要容忍西装制作过程中的不确定性。大卫·派伊 （David Pye）在比较确定性工艺（workmanship of certainty）与风险工艺（workmanship of risk）时，讨论的就是这个问题。我觉得区分这两者是很有用的，但这种区分需要一些解释。

派伊是一个著名的家具制造商，也是伦敦皇家艺术学院的家具设计系教授。1968 年，他出版了颇具影响力的著作《工艺的本质与艺术》（ The Nature and Art of Workmanship）。他从一个定义开始讲起：

如果必须说出「技艺」这个词的含义，我认为最接近的意思是，使用任何技术或设备的工艺 —— 这种工艺的成果不能预先确定，而是取决于匠人工作时的判断、灵巧手艺与关心。其基本理念是，在制造的过程中，成果的质量始终面临着风险。所以我将这种工艺称为「风险工艺」。这个用词虽然不太优雅，但至少说清了基本含义。

顺便一提，在工艺中，关心比判断和灵巧的手艺更重要，不过这种关心可能是习惯性的、无意识的。

派伊继续写道：

我们可以把「确定性工艺」与风险工艺进行比较。前者始终存在于批量生产的过程中，尤其是完全自动化的批量生产。在这类工艺中，成果的质量在任何一个可以销售的产品被制造出来之前就完全确定了………

风险工艺最典型、最为人熟知的例子就是用笔写字，而确定性工艺的例子则是现代印刷术…… 从原则上讲，这两种不同的工艺之间有着明确的区别，这种区别在于这个问题：「一旦开始生产，成果是否就已经确定、不容更改了？」

对于现在的读者来说，派伊举的 20 世纪 60 年代的例子可能显得有些奇怪，因为现在手写的东西越来越少，而印刷已经进入了数字化时代。然而，他的观点是明确的。他对「任何技术或设备」的强调表明，他不仅考虑了传统的制造技术，也展望了新生的技术。派伊谈论的不是产品质量低劣的风险。相反，他谈论的是产品内在的不确定性，即无法预先明确将会发生什么。这是成果可预测性上的风险，而不是使用者或体验者要面临的风险。

我在本书中提到的所有专家，都要采用风险工艺。外科手术、定制西装、临床问诊、魔术表演、石雕、音乐表演、发型设计 —— 所有这些工作的成果都不是预先确定的，也不是不可改变的。它们都包含不确定性。

对于现在的读者来说，「风险」这个词还有其他意思，即我们自己或他人面临危险的可能性，或者涉及金融的后果、公共安全的威胁。当然，这两种风险的概念有重叠之处，尤其是涉及人类的时候。和人一起工作时，没有什么是确定的。因此，派伊强调判断、灵巧手艺和关心的重要性，并指出关心远比另两者重要。

虽然派伊使用的术语有些古老，但我赞同他的理念 —— 他阐明了一些至关重要的东西。专家的工作中贯穿着一种必要的不确定性。随着经验的积累，你必须接纳并处理这种不确定性。这就是为什么随机应变、另辟蹊径的能力是至关重要的。做外科医生的时候，我逐渐意识到，在做手术之前，我唯一能够确定的事情是，有些事情我无法预先知道。这些事情可能是伤口的细节，也可能是解剖学上的变异；可能是患者器官与组织的运作方式，也可能是缝合这些器官与组织时可能会遇到的意外；可能是我会遇见的出血量出乎意料，也可能是某些组织平面因为以前的手术或感染而黏住或消失。我无法事先判断哪些组织结构会成为濒临崩溃的脆弱工作对象。

正是在这种未知的情况下，我才需要足够的信心和技能来随机应变。也许我无法提前知道我会发现什么，但我必须相信我能应付得来。

### 9.6 应对不可预测的事情

Responding to the unpredictable

Improvisation and risk go hand in hand. When you try something new, there's always the possibility that it won't work out the way you hoped. In Chapter 6 , we looked at what happens when you get things wrong and have to put them right. In this chapter, we've explored the idea that experts are always improvising, always responding to the unexpected. Now, we'll bring these ideas together to talk about resilience and recovery.

Experts take responsibility for the variation inherent in their work. They read the materials they work with and the people their work is for – their audience, their clients, their patients. Experts adapt their knowhow to each set of circumstances, and reconsider the problem every time. They remain in dialogue with their work and their audience. Dealing with complications goes with the territory, and learning how to cope when things go wrong is one of the marks of becoming expert. Resilience and recovery are essential qualities if you are to continue to develop as an expert.

Sometimes a bowel anastomosis (joining two sections of intestine together after cutting a section out) springs a leak after the operation itself is over. These things happen and it's nobody's fault. In medicine, they are referred to as ‘complications'. They're part of the uncertainty that goes with operating; some patients heal better than others.

This is different from making an error. Complications are things that go wrong even when you have done the right thing. Every surgical operation has a complication rate, and you can give it a number. You might say that the leakage rate after partial gastrectomy (removing part of the stomach) is 5 per cent. If you operate on one hundred patients, five of them will have a leak. When that happens to someone you've operated on, it doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong, though it's hard to believe that at the time. It's just one of the realities of working with live human beings.

There are equivalents in every field. If you're a ceramicist, there's an inherent unpredictability about glazing and firing. Sometimes a batch simply doesn't work and you can't figure out why. If you haven't ever had a complication, it usually just means you haven't done enough operations, made enough pots or been working in your field for long enough.

We often think of the tangible things which experts create, like vases, paintings or suits. But, as we've seen, many experts create transient experiences such as music, magic or fine dining. Here, too, there is the workmanship of risk. Here, too, there is uncertainty.

Doing the best job you can means doing things slightly differently each time, responding to the specifics of the moment. Whenever that happens, you have improvised. When Joshua says, ‘This will be the best jacket you have ever had,' he is asking his customer to trust him to come up with a solution for their unique needs, rather than applying a predetermined approach. Joshua's skill, like mine as a GP, lies as much in defining the problem as in knowing how to solve it. This highlights the contrast between a human expert and an algorithm. Some medical procedures, such as diagnosing cervical cancer by identifying abnormal smear cells under the microscope, can be done effectively by mechanized systems. But robots are no good at telling patients that they have cancer or listening to their concerns. Each doctor will approach a diagnosis differently, judging what's best for that patient.Responding to the unpredictable

随机应变总是与风险如影随形。当你尝试新事物时，总会有不如所愿的可能性。在第 6 章中，我们探讨了犯错和必须纠错的情况。在这一章里，我们谈到了专家总是在随机应变，总是应对意料之外的事情。接下来，我们要把这些理念汇集在一起，谈一谈抗逆力与复原力的问题。

专家要为他们工作中固有的变化负责。他们要读懂自己的工作对象，读懂他们工作的受众 —— 他们的观众、客户、患者。

专家会根据不同的情况调整自己的技巧，在不同的场合都会重新思考眼前的问题。他们会一直与自己的作品、与受众对话。

处理错综复杂的意外情况，是专家必须要做的事情，学习处理出错的事情是成为专家的标志之一。如果你要继续成长为一名专家，那么抗逆力与复原力就是必要的素质。

有时肠吻合术（切除一段肠道后将两节肠子缝合在一起）结束后会出现泄漏。这种事有时会发生，不是任何人的错。在医学上，这种现象被称为「并发症」。这是手术的不确定性的一部分，有些患者比其他患者恢复得更好。

这和犯错是不同的。并发症是指，即使你做了正确的事情依然会出现的问题。每种外科手术都有一个并发症发生率，你可以找到确切的数字。你可以说，部分胃切除术（切除部分胃部）后的泄漏率为 5％。如果你给 100 个患者做手术，其中 5 人会有泄漏。如果这种事发生在你的手术患者身上，并不一定意味着你做错了什么，尽管在当时你很难相信这一点。这只是与活人一同工作要面对的现实之一。

每个领域都有类似的事情。如果你是陶艺师，在上釉和烧制的时候就要面对一种固有的不确定性。有时一批产品就是会出问题，而你不知道其中的原因。如果你从没遇到过「并发症」，这通常意味着你做的手术、陶罐不够多，或者在你的领域里工作的时间不够长。

我们经常能想到专家创造的有形的东西，比如花瓶、画作或西装。但我们也看到了，许多专家创造的是短暂的体验，比如音乐、魔术或美食。在这些领域里，也涉及风险工艺，也有不确定性。

尽你所能做到最好，意味着你每次做事都稍有不同，都要对当下的具体情况做出反应。每当这种事情发生时，你都是在随机应变。当约书亚说「这将是你拥有过的最棒的西装上衣」时，他是在请客户相信他能为他们的独特需求制订解决方案，而不是采用某种既定的做法。约书亚的裁缝技艺，与我作为全科医生的技能一样，既在于界定问题，也在于知道如何解决问题。这凸显了人类专家与算法之间的差别。机械化系统可以高效地完成一些医疗流程，如在显微镜下发现异常的涂片细胞以诊断宫颈癌。但是，机器人不擅长告诉患者他们得了癌症，也不擅长倾听他们的担忧。每个医生都会用不同的方式处理诊断结果，判断怎么做对患者最有利。

### 9.7 学会什么都不做

Learning to sit on your hands

A lot of published research compares surgery to aviation, exploring how cockpit drills can make surgical procedures safer. By introducing systems from the flight deck, the argument goes, it should be possible to eliminate errors like putting in a heart valve the wrong way round. But now that flying is so safe, most civil aviation has become routine and uneventful. On long-haul international flights, very little happens for much of the time. Of course, there is still extensive training for every conceivable contingency. As we saw when Captain Chesley Sullenberger had to bring his airliner down on the Hudson River, every so often a major disaster occurs – or is narrowly avoided. But these are rare exceptions. Military aviation is a different story.

Phil Bayman is a combat pilot. With over 4,500 flying hours in his logbook, he has seen pretty much everything. Not only has he flown countless missions, but he also trains other pilots. Many of the Red Arrows (the crack UK aerobatic team) are his former students.

Phil and his colleagues have been through all the steps in this book. By the time a combat pilot starts going out on operational sorties, only 15 per cent of their attentional capacity is taken up by flying the plane. The remaining 85 per cent is ‘mission management', assessing and responding to each situation and making split-second decisions. When you think that Hawks and Tornadoes fly at near-supersonic speeds, you begin to realize what these pilots face. As Phil puts it, ‘You are at the limits of your capability.'

Combat flying makes extraordinary demands. In addition to external threats like enemy aircraft, missiles and the challenges of terrain and weather, there are physiological hazards such as G-forces. Phil explained it to me like this: ‘Combat flying is a big game of chess and there are many, many variables. If something starts to go wrong – with your plane, your body or your team – you have to decide which is the biggest crocodile trying to clamber into your boat, and deal with that first.' To do so, you need to keep your wits about you, to respond to what's happening around and within you – in other words, to improvise.

Improvising is a skill you can learn. Phil has a mantra for the pilots he teaches: ‘When things go wrong – sit on your hands and count to ten. There's very little that can't wait for a short time. There are bigger dangers in acting too soon, in committing yourself to a line of action you haven't thought through.' Despite the obvious differences between piloting a fighter jet in a dogfight at the speed of sound and leading a surgical operation, his approach makes perfect sense to me as a clinician.

As a trauma surgeon, you have to decide which are the biggest crocodiles trying to clamber into your boat. When you're faced with torrential bleeding, your first impulse is to put a clamp on something. But in that pool of blood you might clamp the wrong thing and make matters worse. Surgical textbooks describe techniques for gaining control, for recognizing where the blood is coming from, for repairing arteries and veins. They say much less about your internal state – about what it feels like to be on the front line during an operation. It's not just the bleeding, it's how you respond that determines the outcome. Experienced surgeons have learned to gain temporary control of a situation before making irrevocable decisions. They might put in gauze packs and press hard, controlling the bleeding for long enough to step back, think through the options and decide on a strategy. Figuratively speaking, they, too, sit on their hands and count to ten.

Surgery has its G-force equivalents. Tiredness is one of them. During my training it took me a long time to recognize that my decision-making towards the end of a weekend on call, sleep-deprived after working for forty-eight hours non-stop, was questionable to say the least. Gradually I began to understand the signs. I would start to slow down, become indecisive, giggle inappropriately, and become unable to process multiple sources of information. Like pilots experiencing severe G-forces, these manifestations of fatigue are insidious. They creep up without you noticing.

In the operating theatre that evening with Themba, I was lucky. It was early in the intake and I was fully alert. In that welter of blood, I pulled myself together and tried to be methodical, identifying landmarks so I could orient myself and work out what had been injured. My assistant dabbed gently with a swab and suddenly a jet of blood spurted out. Pulsatile, so it must be arterial. Sister Mbata handed me a gauze pack; I fed it into the wound and got my assistant to press hard while I gathered myself and tried to think logically. At least I'd stabilized things for long enough to fight my panic and consider my options. I'd reached a place of temporary safety where I could pause and reset. Knowing how to find that place of safety was crucial.

许多已发表的研究将外科与航空进行了比较，探讨了驾驶舱内的规章制度如何使外科手术更加安全。这种观点认为，引入驾驶舱内的制度到手术室应该能够消除一些错误，例如把心脏瓣膜的方向装反。但是，现在的飞行已经很安全了，大多数民用航空已经变成了平安无事的例行事务。在长途国际航班上，大部分时间里很少有事发生。当然，针对每一种可能的突发事件，仍会有大量的培训。正如切斯利·萨伦伯格机长不得不把飞机迫降在哈德逊河上这件事，重大灾难偶尔也会发生 —— 或者侥幸避免，但这些都是罕见的例外。军事航空则是另外一回事。

菲尔·贝曼（Phil Bayman）是一名战斗机飞行员。他的飞行日志上有超过 4500 小时的飞行时间，他差不多什么都见过。他不仅执行过无数次飞行任务，还训练过其他飞行员。许多「红箭」（英国一流的特技飞行表演队）队员以前都是他的学生。

菲尔和他的同事经历过本书讲述的所有步骤。战斗机飞行员在执行作战任务时，只有 15％的注意力放在驾驶飞机上。余下的 85％ 则用于「任务管理」，评估每一种情况并做出反应，他们要在瞬间做出决定。想一想「鹰」式、「狂风」式战斗机以接近超音速飞行的样子，你就能意识到飞行员面对的是什么情况。

就像菲尔所说：「你已经到了你能力的极限。」

战斗机飞行的要求很高。除了敌机、导弹这样的外部威胁，以及地形、天气这样的挑战以外，还有诸如重力这样的生理危险。菲尔是这样向我解释的：「战斗机飞行像一盘大棋，里面有很多很多变量。如果出现了问题 —— 比如你的飞机、身体、团队出了问题，这些问题就像试图爬到船上的鳄鱼，而你必须判断哪条鳄鱼个头最大，然后优先处理它。」要做到这一点，你就必须保持头脑冷静、对外界和内在发生的事情做出反应 —— 也就是说，随机应变。

随机应变是一种可以学习的技能。对他教过的飞行员，菲尔常说一句话：「事情出错的时候，什么都不要做，先数到十。很少有事不能等上片刻。在没想清楚的情况下草率行动，会有更大的危险。」尽管以音速驾驶战斗机进行空战与带领外科手术团队有明显的区别，但作为一名医生，菲尔的方法在我看来很有道理。

作为创伤外科医生，你必须判断哪条试图爬到船上的鳄鱼最大。当你遇到大出血时，你的第一反应是用止血钳夹住什么东西。但是在那些血肉模糊的组织里，你可能会夹住不该夹的东西，让问题变得更糟糕。外科教科书讲述了控制局面、识别出血位置、修复动脉与静脉的技术。这些教材很少提到你的内心状态 —— 亲手做手术的感觉。不仅是出血决定了手术的结果，还有你的反应。经验丰富的外科医生学会了在做出不可挽回的决定之前暂时控制住局面。他们可能会用力按压纱布包，控制出血，争取足够的时间，以便后退一步，仔细考虑各种选项，并选择一种策略。形象地说，他们也会什么都不做，先数到十。

战斗机驾驶员会受重力的影响，外科手术中也有类似的不利因素。疲劳就是其中之一。在我实习的过程中，我花了很长时间才意识到，在周末值班即将结束的时候，在连续工作 48 个小时、睡眠不足的情况下，我的决策能力至少可以说是有问题的。我逐渐了解了这些迹象。我会开始变得迟钝、犹豫不决、不合适地傻笑，并且无法加工多个来源的信息。就像受到重力严重影响的飞行员一样，疲劳的这些表现是暗藏的。它们会在不知不觉间影响你。

那晚和滕巴一起在手术室里的时候，我很幸运。滕巴入院得早，我非常清醒。在那摊血泊之中，我振作精神，努力做到细致周全，辨认各种参照点，以便弄清各种组织结构的位置，找到受伤的部位。我的助手用棉签轻轻擦拭，突然一股血喷了出来。血流是搏动的，所以一定是动脉出血。姆巴塔护士递给我一个纱布包，我把它塞进伤口里，让助手用力按压，好让我冷静下来，试着用逻辑思考。至少我让滕巴的伤情稳定了足够长的时间，以便克服我的恐惧，考虑我的选项。我有了一种暂时的安全感，能够暂停下来、重整旗鼓。知道如何找到那种安全感是至关重要的。

### 9.8 找到你的安全感

Finding your place of safety

Why is sitting on your hands important? And what does it have to do with improvisation? Improvisation requires you to notice cues and respond to them. When you're dealing with an emergency, or when you're tired or stressed out, your attention narrows to a single point. Having a method to reach a place of safety, kicking the biggest crocodile out of your boat, allows you to experiment and improvise a more permanent solution – to sail somewhere where there aren't any crocodiles.

Long after my experience with Themba, I invited a group of experts to spend a day discussing error and recovery. Phil Bayman the combat pilot was one of them. He set the scene by telling us about an occasion when something felt wrong as he was coming in to land, though he didn't know what. He'd gone through all the steps of his pre-landing checklist, but he still had a sense that something felt odd. Instead of trying to analyse the problem, he aborted his landing, put on full power and climbed to a safe altitude. Once he had time to think, he realized that, despite going through his checklist, he hadn't actually pulled the lever that activated the undercarriage. He had said the words, but he hadn't done the action, just like my student doctor who had gone through the motions of taking somebody's pulse without actually counting it. Unlike the student, though, Phil the expert recognized when something was wrong. In that moment, he only had seconds to react; if he'd stopped to analyse the situation, he'd have crashed and died. By responding instinctively and climbing to a place of safety, he bought himself time. Only when things were more stable did he replay the last few minutes in his mind and identify the problem.

Though the experts in this book work in very different fields, they have all developed a feeling for what the embroiderer Fleur Oakes refers to as ‘wrongness', a special sense that puts them on high alert. When that occurs they do something about it, often so fast that they hardly know what's happened. They have developed systems which stabilize the situation, then give them time to analyse the problem and work out what to do – allowing them to sit on their hands and count to ten. That's how they can switch from forward-thinking reasoning, where they just do what works, to backward-thinking reasoning about the cause.

Not all problems happen with the intensity of combat flying, of course. Earlier in his career, Joshua sometimes had trouble with fitting a sleeve to a jacket. Usually this went smoothly, but sometimes he would realize that things were not going according to plan. The sleeve didn't seem to fit and everything became a struggle. At first he would fiddle with the fabric, but that only made things worse and he would feel his hands tensing up. Eventually he learned to use that tenseness as a signal that it was time to put the work aside and think differently. He would stop sewing and make a cup of tea. That was his place of safety. When he came back, the problem looked different. Once the situation was stabilized, he could think back to those fundamental principles of construction his teacher had taught him. That allowed him to analyse the problem, bring his backward-thinking reasoning into play and then improvise. But first he had to pause, reset and consider.

One of my surgical consultants said almost the same thing when I was starting my training at Baragwanath. ‘If the shit hits the fan and you don't know what to do,' she told me, ‘start by doing nothing. Call for some gauze packs, get your assistant to press hard, then go and have a cup of tea. By the time you come back and re-scrub, things will look different.' I didn't believe her at first, but in that operating theatre with Themba, her words came back to me.

In one sense, the challenges I've just described could hardly be more different. Nobody dies if you play a wrong note or bungle a sleeve, whereas you could easily be wiped out in a fighter aircraft or severely damage a patient on the operating table. But the principle of recognizing that something isn't right, going to a place of safety and thinking what to do next is a characteristic of the expert improviser.

When novices narrow their focus, experts widen theirs. They respond to the situation as a whole, not to isolated elements. Sometimes a completely different solution pops into their mind. Sometimes they experience serendipity.

为什么什么都不做很重要？这和随机应变又有什么关系？

随机应变需要你注意各种线索并做出反应。当你在处理紧急情况时，或者感到疲劳或压力过大时，你的注意力就会缩小到一个点上。设法找到安全感，把最大的鳄鱼从船上踹下去，可以让你尝试并找出更长远的解决方案 —— 把船开到没有鳄鱼的地方去。

在给滕巴做手术的很久以后，我请了一批专家，花了一天时间讨论错误与纠错。战斗机飞行员菲尔·贝曼就是其中之一。他首先给我们讲了一个故事。有一次在降落的时候，他感觉有些不对劲，但自己也不知道为什么。他检查完了降落前的各项步骤，但他还是感觉有些不对劲。他没有试图分析问题，而是放弃了降落，开足马力，爬升到了安全的高度。有时间思考之后，他意识到，尽管他按照各项步骤做了检查，但他没有拉起起落架的控制杆。他只在口头做了检查，但没有付诸行动，就像我监考时看到的那个医学生，他摸了患者的脉搏，却没有真的去数。不过，与那个学生不同的是，菲尔是专家，能够觉察问题。在那一刻，他只有几秒钟的反应时间。如果他停下来分析当时的情况，他就会坠机而死。通过本能的反应，爬升到安全的高度，他为自己争取了时间。在情况稳定下来之后，他才会在脑海中回想刚才几分钟内发生的事情，找出问题所在。尽管本书中的专家所从事的领域各不相同，但他们都有一种如刺绣师弗勒尔·奥克斯所说的「错误意识」，一种让他们高度警惕的特殊感觉。一旦有了这种感觉，他们就会采取相应的行动，这个过程通常很快，以至于他们几乎不知道发生了什么。他们逐渐掌握了一种稳定局面的系统方法，能为他们争取分析问题、找出解决办法的时间 —— 让他们什么都不做，数到十。正是通过这种方式，他们才能从预见性思维模式（做行之有效的事情）转变到回溯性思维模式，寻找问题的原因。

当然，并非只有在驾驶战斗机的紧张情况下才会出现问题。在职业生涯早期，裁缝约书亚有时很难把袖子缝到西装上衣上。通常情况下，一切都很顺利，但有时他会发现事情并不如他所想的那样。袖子似乎并不贴合上衣，一切都变得非常困难。一开始，他会反复调整布料，但这只会让事情变得更糟，他的双手会变得僵硬起来。后来，他学会了把这种僵硬感当作一个信号：是时候把工作放在一旁，换一种思考方式了。他会放下针线活，泡杯茶。这是他寻找安全感的方式。等他回到工作中的时候，问题看上去就不一样了。一旦情况稳定下来，他就能回想起老师教给他的那些基本制衣原则。这样他就能分析问题，运用回溯性思维，随机应变。但首先他必须暂停下来，重整旗鼓，思考眼前的问题。

当我开始在巴拉瓜纳医院实习的时候，有一位外科顾问医师说过一句几乎相同的话：「要是你遇上了大麻烦，不知道该怎么做，」她说，「先什么都别做。要一些纱布包，让助手用力压住，然后你去喝杯茶。等你回来重新擦洗的时候，事情就会不一样了。」起初我不相信她，但是给滕巴做手术的时候，她的话又出现在了我的脑海里。

从某种意义上说，我刚才描述的几种挑战是完全不同的。弹错一个音符、缝坏一只袖子，没有人会死，但你在战斗机上很可能会被消灭，在手术台上也可能严重伤害一位患者。但是意识到情况不对劲、找到安全感、思考下一步该怎么做的原则，是专家级随机应变者的共同特点。

当新手缩小关注点时，专家会扩大自己的关注点。他们会对整体情况做出反应，而不只是应对孤立的因素。有时他们会想到一个完全不同的解决方案。有时他们会有意外的收获。

### 9.9 转祸为福

Turning wrong into right

Katharine Coleman is a glass engraver, widely known for her exquisite work with coloured glass. She depends on expert glassblowers to create the materials she works with. One day, Katharine collected a heavy bowl she was going to engrave as a commission. She was shocked to notice that there were ash marks in the glass. Horrified, she complained to the glassblower. He looked at her pityingly, then reassured her that the marks were just on the surface and everything would be fine. Just polish it, he told her, and the marks would disappear.

Katharine didn't believe him. She couldn't see or feel anything on the surface, and she was convinced that the glass itself was faulty. Back in her studio she examined the bowl again, even more sure that ash from the making process had been embedded in it. But she had no alternative, so she polished it anyway. To her astonishment, within a few seconds all the marks had vanished. Just as the glassblower had told her, the ash had been on the surface all along, and it was the optical properties of the curved bowl that made it look internal.

Katharine's first feeling was overwhelming relief. But with a flash of insight, she realized she had stumbled on something that could revolutionize her practice. Anything you do on the outer surface of a thick-walled piece of curved glass looks different once it's been refracted by the transparent material and reflected onto its inner surface. Though glassblowers have known this since time immemorial, it needed someone like Katharine to exploit the phenomenon for engraving. Now, working to Katharine's specification, the glassblower covers a thick-walled transparent bowl with a thin skin of coloured glass, like the peel of an apple or a potato. Katharine uses this like a canvas for incising her designs, allowing her to develop the creations she is now widely known for.

Katharine told me she could easily have focused on being angry that the glass she had ordered had gone wrong (as she thought). But instead she reframed that experience as an opportunity. From this point of view, error, variation and unpredictability are not to be eliminated. They are to be embraced, because they spur creativity – if you have the imagination to see it like that. That sort of imagination is a form of improvisation, of recognizing the potential within an unexpected situation. Like Keith Johnstone and his actors, Katharine was responding with ‘Yes, and …'

凯瑟琳·科尔曼（Katharine Coleman）是一名玻璃雕花师，以其精美的彩色玻璃作品而闻名。她依靠专业的玻璃吹制工来为她制作她所使用的材料。一天，凯瑟琳去取一只很重的碗，她受托为这只碗雕花。她震惊地发现玻璃上有灰烬的痕迹。

她吓坏了，向玻璃吹制工抱怨。玻璃吹制工同情地看着她，安慰她说痕迹只是在表面上，一切都会好起来的。他对她说，只要继续打磨，这些痕迹就会消失。

凯瑟琳不相信他。她在玻璃的表面上看不到也摸不着任何痕迹，她确信玻璃本身有问题。回到工作室里，她再次检查了这只碗，更加确定是制作过程中留下的灰烬嵌在了玻璃里。可她别无选择，于是还是开始打磨这只碗。令她惊讶的是，几秒钟内，所有的痕迹都消失了。正如玻璃吹制工告诉她的那样，灰烬一直都在玻璃表面，是碗的光学特性使灰烬看上去像是在内部。

凯瑟琳的第一感觉是彻底的解脱。然而她产生了一个顿悟，她意识到自己在无意中发现了一些可能彻底改变她工作方式的东西。你在厚壁曲面玻璃外表面上做的任何加工，一旦经过透明材料的折射，再反射到其内表面，就会看上去不一样。虽然玻璃吹制工自古以来就知道这一点，但只有凯瑟琳这样的人才能利用这一现象进行雕花。现在，按照凯瑟琳的要求，玻璃吹制工会在厚壁透明玻璃碗上覆盖一层薄薄的有色玻璃，就像一层苹果皮或土豆皮一样。凯瑟琳把这层有色玻璃当作「画布」来雕刻她设计的图样，使她能够制作出现在广为人知的作品。

凯瑟琳告诉我，她当时很有可能只顾生气，认定她定制的玻璃出了问题（就像她想的一样）。但是她把这次经历变成了一个机会。从这个角度来看，错误、变化和不可预测性都不是应该被完全消除的东西。我们应该拥抱它们，因为它们会催生创意 —— 如果你有这样看待它们的想象力的话。这种想象力是一种随机应变，是在意想不到的情况下发现可能性。就像基思·约翰斯通和他的演员一样，凯瑟琳是在用「是的，而且……」的态度做出反应。

### 9.10 在压力下随机应变

Improvising under pressure

In the operating theatre at Bara with Themba, I'm fighting a rising sense of panic. My assistant suppresses the bleeding with a gauze pack, and I have time to get some distance. I walk round the operating theatre, trying to calm down and think. Back at the table, I remove the pack and discover that the knife wound has gone through a branch of Themba's carotid artery. I clip and tie it, hoping that will solve the problem. It doesn't, and blood continues to spurt. It's coming from the back of his neck and I realize it must be the vertebral artery. This is a nightmare scenario. As its name suggests, the artery runs through a bony channel formed by the cervical vertebrae. This makes it almost inaccessible. Arteries are elastic, and if one has been severed, its cut ends retract. If that happens inside a place where you can't reach it, such as that bony channel in the neck, the blood will keep pumping and the patient may bleed to death in front of you. I've already seen that happen more than once.

With Themba, nobody else is available to help. Even if I call my consultant in from home it will be at least forty-five minutes before she arrives, and by then it may be too late. It's up to me to do something, and do it now. I'm scared stiff, I'm not yet an expert and I'm seriously out of my depth. But I have to put that to one side. Now I really have to improvise. I try to think as widely as I can. I need inspiration.

Suddenly I have a brainwave. From somewhere – maybe a coffee-room conversation, or an operative surgery book, a journal or just someone's anecdote – I remember a story about using the balloon of a Foley catheter to control this kind of bleeding. Foley catheters are usually used for draining urine. You feed one along a patient's urethra until the catheter's tip is in the bladder. Then you use a syringe to inflate a tiny balloon that stops the catheter slipping out again. The idea with a vertebral artery injury is that the bony channel is so narrow that even a small balloon will apply enough pressure to stop the artery spurting blood. This ‘tamponade', as it's called, can be a lifesaver. At least, that's the theory. It's worth a try. I've got to do something, as Themba's in danger of bleeding out.

I take a deep breath and ask for a paediatric Foley catheter. Sister Mbata looks at me as if I've gone loopy – we're operating on an adult's neck, not a child's pelvis. But she gets me one anyway. Although she has no idea what I'm trying to do, she responds to my weird request with a ‘Yes, and …' We are improvising together.

I feed the catheter into the depths of Themba's wound. Every time I move the gauze swab, the field fills up with blood. Finally, I manoeuvre the catheter's tip into position, inflate the balloon and cross my fingers. Mercifully the bleeding stops and Themba's blood pressure stabilizes. Things are under control at last, and I can take my time. It's still difficult, but finally I get a clip on the artery and stop the blood flooding out. Things are more straightforward from then on and I go back to the techniques I've learned from books. An hour or so later it's almost over, and I'm closing the skin. Themba's lost a lot of blood and he needs to go to the intensive care unit, but he's young and fit. He makes a good recovery, and soon he's able to go back to the general ward. Not long after that, he's well enough to go home. But it was a close call.

My experience that night in the operating theatre with Themba turned out to be a watershed. Watching him leave hospital a few days after I feared he'd die on the operating table showed me yet again that not everything I needed to know was in the books. It gave me the confidence that I could find a solution when I needed to. Decades later, my heart still races when I think back to that operation. At the time I was just thankful to have got away with it, to have come up with a trick that worked. But now I think of it as improvisation, of drawing on information that was floating around somewhere in my mind – finding it when I needed it most. At last, I was beginning to become expert.

The ability to improvise is characteristic of any expert. It's how people bring together the skills and insights they've been developing for years and apply them to each new situation they encounter. Like the bass player in the jazz trio earlier in this chapter, you're able to solve a problem you couldn't have anticipated. Sometimes, this capacity to think round corners can even take your work in a new direction. That's what the next chapter is about.

在巴拉瓜纳医院给滕巴做手术的时候，我正在与越来越强烈的恐慌感作斗争。我的助手用纱布包按压出血的位置，我还有时间后退一步。我在手术室里来回踱步，试图冷静下来思考。

回到手术台旁，我取下纱布包，发现刀伤穿透了滕巴颈动脉的一个分支。我用止血钳夹住这个分支血管，打了个结，希望这样能解决问题。但是问题没有解决，血液还是喷涌而出。血是从他脖子后部来的，我意识到一定是椎动脉出血了。这是噩梦一般的情况。顾名思义，椎动脉就是那条穿过颈椎构成的骨通道的动脉。因此这条动脉几乎是够不着的。动脉是有弹性的，如果动脉被切断，切口处的血管就会收缩。如果这种情况发生在够不着的地方，比如脖子内部的骨通道里，血液就会一直喷涌而出，患者就会在你面前失血过多而死。这种事我已经见过不止一次了。

在给滕巴做手术的时候，没有人能帮上忙。即使我把顾问医师从家里叫来，她也至少需要 45 分钟才能赶到，那时可能就太晚了。只能由我来采取行动，而且必须立刻行动。我吓坏了，我还不是专家，而且这件事大大超出了我的能力范围。我必须把这种感觉放在一边。现在我真的得随机应变了。我试着尽可能地拓宽思路。我需要灵感。

我突然灵机一动。我不知从哪里（也许是咖啡馆里的对话，或是一本外科手术专著、期刊，或者某人的逸事）想起一个用导尿管的气囊来控制这种出血的故事。导尿管通常用于排尿。你要沿着患者的尿道插入导尿管，直到尖端进入膀胱。然后用注射器给一个小气囊充气，防止导尿管滑出。如何将导尿管用于椎动脉损伤呢？我的想法是，椎动脉的骨通道非常狭窄，即便是一个小气囊也能施加足够的压力，阻止动脉喷出血液。这个小气囊叫作「填塞物」，可能救人一命。至少在理论上如此。这值得一试。我必须采取行动，因为滕巴就要失血过多了。

我深吸一口气，要了一根儿科的导尿管。姆巴塔护士看着我，好像我发疯了一样 —— 我们在给成年人的脖子动手术，而不是孩子的骨盆。但她还是给我找来了一根。虽然她不知道我想做什么，但她用「是的，而且……」的态度回应了我奇怪的要求，我们在一同随机应变。

我把导尿管插入了滕巴的伤口深处。每当我移开纱布片，伤口就会溢满血液。最后，我谨慎地将导尿管的尖端送到了正确的位置，给气囊充气，然后默默祈求好运。幸运的是，出血停止了，滕巴的血压稳定下来了。局面终于被控制住了，我可以慢下来了。手术依然很困难，但最后我还是用止血钳夹住了动脉，血液不再喷涌而出了。之后的事情就变得更简单了，我又用上了从书本里学到的技巧。一个多小时后，手术即将结束，我开始缝合皮肤。滕巴流了很多血，需要去重症监护室，不过他还年轻，身强力壮。他恢复得很好，很快就回到普通病房了。不久之后，他就恢复得可以回家了。不过这次手术真是千钧一发。

事实证明，那天晚上在手术室里给滕巴动手术的经历是一个分水岭。看着他离开医院，想到几天之前我还在担心他会死在手术台上，我再次意识到，我需要知道的一切并非都在书本里。这给了我信心，让我在需要的时候能够找到解决办法。

十年后，当我再回想起那次手术时，我的心依然怦怦直跳。当时我很庆幸自己能侥幸成功，想出了一个有效的办法。但我现在认为那是一种随机应变，利用了我脑海中的零散信息 —— 在我最需要的时候找到了这些信息。终于，我开始成为专家了。

随机应变的能力是任何专家的特征。随机应变是我们将多年来积累的技能与领悟融会贯通，运用于我们遇到的每一种新情况中的方式。就像本章前面提到的爵士乐三重奏中的贝斯手一样，你能够解决意想不到的问题。有时候，这种灵活思维的能力甚至能把你的工作带向新的方向。这就是下一章的主题。
