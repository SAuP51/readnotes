## 0401. 运用感官

0401 Using your senses

It's the middle of the night at Baragwanath Hospital in 1982. I'm ‘first call' for our surgical unit and I'm starting a laparotomy. My patient is Poppy. She's twenty-six years old and has typhoid. It's a terrible disease and it has punched holes in Poppy's intestine. Her whole system is septic and she's very sick. By this time I've done a lot of laparotomies, but I've never seen typhoid before. As soon as I make my first incision, I can see I might be in trouble. Poppy's abdominal cavity is full of pus, there are perforations in the gut, and intestinal contents are pouring out. Everything looks a mess and it smells terrible.

The textbooks make operating on perforated bowel sound pretty straightforward. You remove the diseased segment – ‘resect' it, in surgical terminology – then connect the ends to make a watertight join or anastomosis. To do this, you first decide how much you need to cut out, then you identify the arteries and veins which supply that segment. You clip, cut and tie the vessels and check there's no bleeding. Then you put clamps across the bowel, divide it with a scalpel, remove the diseased section, bring the remaining ends together and join them with needle and thread or a stapling device.

This, of course, makes it sound simpler than it really is. For one thing, you have to ensure that you've cut away just enough to reach healthy bowel and that the edges have a good blood supply. If you get this wrong, the join won't heal. It may even leak in the coming days, which can be disastrous. But it can be difficult to tell at the time whether the blood supply is good or not.

The problem with Poppy is that everything's wrong. Her abdominal organs don't look like anything I've seen before. I can't tell where diseased bowel stops and healthy bowel begins. Most of the patients I've been operating on are young, fit men who have been stabbed. Though there's serious damage, their organs are generally healthy. Typhoid changes all of that. My usual reference points have vanished and I'm in a bind.

Poppy's abdomen not only looks and feels different from what I've seen before; it behaves differently too. Typhoid gives human bowel the consistency of wet blotting paper. Every time I touch Poppy's intestine, it starts to fall apart. Though the anatomical structures are familiar, their materiality is weird. Too little tension on any join, and the anastomosis will leak; too tight, and the sutures will tear out. Each could have catastrophic consequences, so I have to get it just right. But how can I recognize what ‘just right' means? How much intestine should I remove? How hard can I pull it? What if handling it makes things worse? The usual cues no longer hold. I'm having to make judgements based on what I see, feel and smell; on things the textbooks can't tell you. I'm having to reconfigure what I thought I knew – and fast. The stakes are high and I'm terrified. How do I decide what to do?

By this time, I've got some way along my path towards becoming expert. I've been through the initial steps as an Apprentice – first as a doctor and now as a surgeon. I've struggled with knowing nothing and feeling out of my depth in everything I do. Now I'm building my internal library of sensations, and really getting to know my materials and tools. I've laid the groundwork through doing time. I've read books and watched other people. I've gained a sense of what normal organs look and feel like. I know a lot about what to do, but much less about how to do it. In this chapter, we'll explore what it means to acquire that knowledge of doing and what happens around its edges. Because now I'm at the limit of my experience. With Poppy, I'm in hostile territory.

那是 1982 年，在巴拉瓜纳医院里的一个深夜。我是我们外科做手术的「第一人选」，我正准备开始做剖腹术。我的患者叫波比。她当时 26 岁，得了伤寒。这是一种可怕的疾病，导致波比的肠子穿孔。她全身的系统都感染了，病得很重。那时，我已经做过很多次剖腹术了，但我从未见过伤寒。在切开第一道切口之后，我就知道我陷入麻烦了。波比的腹腔里满是脓液，肠道也有穿孔，肠道内容物正在大量排出。这一切看起来一团糟，味道极其难闻。

教科书把肠穿孔手术说得很简单。移除病变的部分（用外科术语说，就是「切除」），然后连接两端、缝紧，要滴水不漏（这也叫「吻合术」）。要做到这一点，首先要决定需要切除多少，然后找到为这部分肠子供血的动脉和静脉。夹住、剪开血管并打结，检查有没有出血。然后用夹子夹住肠子，用手术刀切开，取下病变部分，把剩下的肠子末端连在一起，用针线或缝合器固定。

当然，这段话让手术听起来比实际上更简单。举个例子，你必须确保你切除的部分刚好与健康的肠道相邻，并且切除的边缘有良好的血液供应。如果你弄错了，肠道的连接处就不会愈合，甚至可能在未来几天泄漏，这可能带来灾难性的后果。但是，在手术的时候很难判断血液供应是否良好。

波比的问题是，她的一切似乎都不对劲。她的腹腔器官和我以前见过的都不一样。我分不清哪里是病变的肠子，哪里是健康的肠子。被我动过手术的患者，大多数都是年轻力壮、被刺伤的男人。他们的器官虽然受到了严重的损伤，但总体上是健康的。伤寒改变了这一切。我通常的参照物都消失了，我陷入了困境。

波比的腹腔不仅看上去、摸上去不同于我以往的经验，其表现也不同。伤寒会让人的肠道变得像湿漉漉的吸水纸一样。我一触碰波比的肠子，肠子就会裂开。虽然腹腔里的结构是熟悉的，但质地却很奇怪。如果肠道缝合得不够紧，吻合处就会泄漏；如果缝得太紧，缝合线就会撕裂肠子。两种情况都会带来灾难性的后果，所以我必须做得恰到好处。但是，我怎么才能知道什么是「恰到好处」？我应该切除多少肠子？我能缝得多紧？如果我的处理让情况变得更糟了怎么办？通常的线索不再有效了。我必须根据我看到的、摸到的、闻到的东西做出判断。这些判断的依据是教科书无法告诉你的。我必须将我认为自己所知的东西重新组合起来 —— 而且要快。风险很高，我很害怕。我如何才能决定该怎么做？

彼时，我已经在成为专家的旅途上前进了一段路。我已经度过了作为学徒的初始阶段 —— 先是作为医生，现在是作为外科医生。无论我做什么，我都在「一无所知」和「力不从心」的感觉中挣扎。现在我正在建立自己内在的感觉库，并开始真正了解我的工作对象与工具。我已通过积累奠定了基础。我读过书，也观察过其他人。我知道正常的器官看上去的样子和摸上去的感觉。我清楚该做什么，但对于该怎么做，还了解得没那么多。在这一章里，我们会探索获取这种「做」的知识有何意义，以及当这种知识不够用时会发生什么。因为就在那时，我遇到了自己经验的极限。面对波比，我经受了严峻的考验。

### 4.1 你就是知道

‘You just know'

This tension between knowing what you should do and being able to do it is something that many experts describe. It's the same in the calmer world of wood engraving. Andrew Davidson has been an engraver for forty years. Wood engraving is centuries old, a combination of craftsmanship and art. When I visited Andrew in his home at the end of a rutted lane in England's rural Gloucestershire, he was finishing the illustrations for a Harry Potter book. I watched him incising a boxwood block, using engraving tools with names that go back hundreds of years. He laid out spitstickers, scorpers, burins and burnishers, like a surgeon's instruments. I heard the crunch as each tool bit into the smooth, hard wood. Andrew calls this ‘painting with light'. Even without looking he knows when the depth of each mark is right, because he can feel and hear it.

Then came the printing. Using a massive nineteenth-century cast-iron Albion press, Andrew arranged the engraved woodblock, face up. He squeezed black ink from a tube onto a flat stone block, then moved a miniature roller to and fro, coating its cylindrical surface with an even layer. Getting the right thickness of ink is crucial. Andrew judges this by ear, not by eye. ‘As you roll it over the stone, it should sound like the air going out of a Lilo,' he explained, ‘not like the sound of chips frying.'

Andrew inked the woodblock, placed a sheet of paper over it, then used the press's balanced handle to apply just the right amount of pressure for the right amount of time. He raised the handle, peeled off the paper and examined the result. Then he shook his head, inked the block again, put in a fresh sheet of paper and repeated the process until it was right.

Recognizing what's ‘right' has taken Andrew decades to learn. It's not something he can put into words because it's about sensation. He's not just using his hands, but ‘reading' the press with his whole body; responding to the feel, sound and smell of his materials. He knows exactly the amount of pressure to apply. But when he let me have a go, I felt clueless. I was just pulling a heavy lever, with no idea what I was aiming to achieve.

This multisensory awareness is what experts depend on. When you dissect the craft of any expert, you'll find something similar. Yet when you talk to these experts, they struggle to explain. They say things like, ‘Well, you just do what's right – you just know .' But unless you've spent the years they've spent doing it, you can't ‘just know'. And even then, you never really get there. Andrew explained it to me like this: ‘For more than forty years I've been trying to make the perfect print from a woodblock. I never have, and I know I never will. But I'll never stop trying.'

Andrew puts his finger on another important principle. His materials perform best at their limits, when they are stretched almost to breaking point. His finest work will often be at the edge of what his materials will tolerate, at the point of greatest risk – just as Poppy's gut required my best surgical effort. But how can you tell where the limit is? I found out more about that from another expert, this time in the field of ceramics.

许多专家都描述过这种「知道自己应该做什么」与「拥有做这件事的能力」之间的矛盾。在木版雕刻的宁静世界里也是如此。安德鲁·戴维森（Andrew Davidson）从事木版雕刻已经有 40 年了。木版雕刻有数百年的历史，是工艺与艺术的结合。安德鲁的家位于英格兰格洛斯特郡乡下的一条小巷尽头。这条小巷布满了车辙。我去拜访他的时候，他正要完成一卷《哈利·波特》（Harry Potter）的插图。我看着他切开一块黄杨木。

他使用的雕刻工具有着悠久的历史，它们的名称可以追溯到数百年前。他把尖凿、三角雕刀、手推雕刀、抛光器一字排开，就像外科医生用的器械一样。我能听到每件工具嵌进光滑坚硬的木头时发出的声音。安德鲁称这种过程为「用光线绘画」。即使不用眼睛看，他也能知道他雕刻的每个印记的深浅是合适的，因为他能感觉到，能听到。

接下来是印刷。安德鲁把雕好的木板放置在一台巨大的 19 世纪铸铁印刷机上，正面朝上。他把黑色的墨水从管子里挤到一块石板上，然后来回移动一个小型滚筒，在其圆柱体的表面上均匀地涂上一层墨水。墨水层的厚度合适是至关重要的。安德鲁是用耳朵而不是眼睛来判断的。「你把滚筒滚过石板的时候，它发出的声音应该像是空气从充气垫里钻出来一样，」他解释道，「而不是炸薯片的声音。」

安德鲁给木板涂上墨水，在上面放上一张纸，然后用印刷机的平衡手柄在适当的时长内，施加适当的压力。他抬起手柄，剥下纸张，检查印刷效果。然后他摇了摇头，又在木板上涂上墨水，放了一张新的纸上去，重复这个过程，直到结果令人满意为止。

安德鲁花了几十年的时间才弄清什么是「令人满意」。他无法用语言表达，因为这是一种感觉。他不仅在运用双手，更是在用整个身体「解读」印刷过程；他对工作对象的感觉、声音和气味做出了反应。他知道应该施加多大的压力。但当他让我试试的时候，我却感到不知所措。我只是在拉动沉重的手柄，却不知道我想要取得什么效果。

专家依赖的正是这种多感官的意识。分析任何专家的技艺，你都会发现类似的现象。然而，当你与这些专家交谈时，他们却很难解释清楚。他们会说：「这个嘛，你只要做正确的事情就好 —— 你就是知道。」但是，除非你也像他们一样花了多年时间来做这件事，否则你不可能「就是知道」。即便那样，你也永远不会真正达到理想中的境界。安德鲁是这样跟我解释的：「40 多年来，我一直在尝试用木板制作出完美的版画。我从来没做到过，我知道我永远也做不到，但我决不会停止安德鲁指出了另一个重要的原则。他的工作对象在极限状努力。」

态时呈现出的效果最好，也就是在几乎要断裂的时候。他最出色的作品往往产生于工作对象所能承受的极限，面临着极大的风险 —— 就像给波比的肠子动手术需要我使出浑身解数。可是你怎么知道极限在哪儿？关于这个问题，我从另一位专家那里了解到了更多，这次的专家来自陶艺领域。

### 4.2 处于崩溃边缘的工作对象

Thin materials on the verge of collapse

Duncan Hooson teaches pottery at several London art schools. He's a gifted tutor as well as an outstanding artist, and he's published a textbook on ceramics. Though some of his students are highly skilled, many are complete beginners. When I first met Duncan, we talked about how far you can push your materials before you go too far. Duncan calls this ‘working with thin materials on the verge of collapse'. It's a crucial skill for every expert, and it's what I struggled with as I operated on Poppy.

When you watch an expert like Duncan, his work looks effortless. First he ‘wedges' a lump of clay, thumping it like a baker working dough. Then he starts his potter's wheel and slaps the clay onto it. As the wheel picks up speed, he applies a little pressure here, a gentle finger there, and the clay morphs into the curved base of a vase. When he gets to the top of the vessel he draws out its neck by gently pinching the clay between his fingers. When the thickness is just right, he stops pinching. As simple as that.

But of course it isn't really simple at all. This pinching is a crucial operation. Not enough, and the neck stays lumpen and inelegant, too thick for the rest of the vase. Too much, and the clay collapses, unable to sustain its own weight. Then you have to start all over again. Duncan makes this look effortless, a wordless knowledge of just how far he can go. He has built up an awareness of what it feels like to be on the verge of collapse, a sensitivity that tells him when to stop and when to carry on a little further.

Duncan's work only looks effortless because of his decades of practice. Like the other experts in this book, he has been through years of doing time, making thousands of pots and vases. That was his equivalent of taking blood, making pocket flaps or creating flat stone surfaces. Most of his students haven't done that. They have to learn to notice when they're approaching a limit, to recognize that fine line between not far enough and too far. They have to learn to be attentive.

For Duncan, this is a bodily understanding. Potters do much of their work directly with their hands and fingers. Sometimes they use tools – for scraping, separating a pot from its base, inscribing patterns. But most of the time they are in an intimate, unmediated contact with their clay. They develop an exquisite sensitivity. It's this dialogue between Duncan's body and his materials that allows him to make continual adjustments. He may notice that his clay is too dry, too soft or too squidgy. This isn't something that can be defined. Unlike divisions on a ruler, there is no codified, objective ‘scale of squidginess'. Interpreting squidginess requires an internal library, stocked through constant practice.

But it's not only physical materials that can become thin, teetering on the verge of collapse. Whether you're drafting a report, managing conflict in your workplace, practising a piece of music or writing computer code, completion and collapse are never far apart. Too little, and it's not enough. A fraction further, and it's over the edge.

In surgery, this physical knowing is crucial. You learn to ‘read' the landscape you're working in, the organs you're touching. Like the sensation of the road when you're driving – mediated through the suspension of the car and felt through the seat of your pants – this is a combination of body and instruments. As a surgeon I developed similar skills to those Duncan uses when he is shaping the neck of a vase. You see with your fingers and your hands. You sense the squidginess directly. You gauge how springy and healthy an organ feels. You register when it's soggy and waterlogged, abnormally stiff, or overheated. You get a sinking feeling when an organ is starved of its blood supply and has the coldness of ischaemia. You feel the crackle of air in places it shouldn't be. You have a sense of how robust or vulnerable someone's tissue is. You develop an awareness of impending danger when you get too close to the limit.

I find this with words too. I spend a lot of time writing essays for journals and giving talks. There, too, is a fine line to tread. Too few words and it doesn't make sense. Too many and it becomes boring. At various points this book has behaved like a thin material on the verge of collapse. If I make a chapter too short or too long, or include too many examples, all of a sudden the whole thing falls apart. Success depends on recognizing the border, on having the skill to stop just before you cross it. Everyone I've spoken to finds parallels in their own lives – from thickening a sauce in the kitchen to taking the final millimetre off a wood carving. They are all developing their sense of where that verge of collapse lies.

邓肯·胡森（Duncan Hooson）在伦敦的几所艺术学校教授陶艺。他不仅是一位优秀的艺术家，也是一位有天赋的教师，他还出版了一本有关陶艺的教科书。虽然他的一些学生技术高超，但很多人都是初学者。初次遇见邓肯时，我们讨论了能够把工作对象驱使到什么程度而不至于过了头。邓肯说这就是「在崩溃的边缘处理脆弱的工作对象」。这是每个专家的关键技能，也是我在给波比动手术时的难点。

如果观察像邓肯这样的专家，你会发现他的工作似乎毫不费力。首先，他要「挤」出一块黏土，像面包师揉面团一样敲打黏土。然后，他转动陶轮，把黏土拍在轮上。随着陶轮的转速加快，他会在黏土某处施加一点压力，在另一处轻轻按下一根手指，黏土就会变成一个有弧线的花瓶底座。当他开始制作花瓶顶部时，他用手指轻轻捏住黏土，拉出花瓶的颈部。黏土厚度合适时，他就会松开手指。就这么简单。

当然，这一点都不简单。这个捏黏土的动作，是一项至关重要的操作。捏得力道不够，瓶颈就会粗大而不雅观，相对于花瓶的其余部分就显得太厚了。捏得太用力，黏土就会崩塌，无法承受自身的重量。这样你就得从头再来。邓肯让这一切看起来毫不费力。这是一种无言的知识：他知道自己能冒多大的风险。他已经拥有了一种意识：黏土濒临崩塌时会有什么感觉。这种敏感度会告诉他何时松开手指，何时再捏得薄一些。

邓肯的工作看起来毫不费力，是因为他练习了几十年。就像本书中的其他专家一样，他有多年的积累，制作了成千上万个陶罐和花瓶。这就相当于采血、制作袋盖或在石头上雕出平面。他的大多数学生都没有下过这个功夫。他们必须学会注意自己何时正在接近极限，意识到「不够」与「过头」之间的细微差别。他们必须学会专注。

对邓肯来说，这是一种身体上的理解。陶工的大部分工作都是直接用手和手指完成的。他们有时会用工具 —— 用来刮擦、将陶罐与底座分离、雕刻花纹。但大多数时候，他们会与自己的黏土亲密无间地接触。他们会发展出一种极为敏锐的感觉能力。正是邓肯的身体与工作对象之间的对话，使他能够不断地做出调整。他可能会注意到黏土太干、太软或太湿。这不是能清晰界定的标准。这不像尺子上的刻度，没有固定、客观的「湿软尺度」。分析湿软程度需要一种内部的感觉库，这种感觉库是通过不断练习而积累起来的。

并非只有有形的工作对象会变得「脆弱」，濒临崩溃。无论你是在起草一份报告、处理工作场合的冲突、练习一首曲子，还是在编写计算机代码，完成与崩溃总是近在咫尺。少则不足，在外科手术中，这种对有形事物的认识是至关重要的。你多则过度。

要学会「解读」你工作中的情况，你触摸的器官。这就像你在开车时对路况的感觉一样 —— 凭借自己的直觉，通过汽车的悬架感受路面。这是身体和工具的结合。作为外科医生，我发展出了类似邓肯在制作花瓶颈部时使用的技能。你要用你的手指和双手去感受。你能直接感受器官的湿软程度。你能估计器官的弹性与健康程度。如果器官是湿漉漉、异常僵硬或过热的，你就会注意到。如果器官缺乏血液供应，出现局部贫血的冰冷感，你就会有一种不安的感受。你能在不正常的地方感受到空气的噼啪声。你能感觉到一个人的组织有多强壮或多脆弱。在濒临极限的时候，你意识到即将到来的危险。

我发现文字上也有类似的现象。我花了很多时间为期刊写文章和做演讲。在那些事情上也有一条需要把握的界线。说得太少，词不达意；说得太多，则显得无聊。在不同的时刻，这本书就会显得像一种「脆弱」的工作对象，处于崩溃的边缘。

如果我把一章写得太短或太长，或者包含太多的例子，整本书就会突然崩溃。成功取决于看到边界，取决于有能力在越过边界之前停下来。与我交流过的每个专家都在自己的生活中发现了相似的情况 —— 无论是让厨房里的酱汁变稠，还是从木雕上再去掉最后一毫米的木料。他们都发展出了这样的意识：知道崩渍的边缘在哪里。

### 4.3 机械师的感觉

Mechanic's feel

In the operating theatre with Poppy I'm up against thin materials on the verge of collapse in surgery, though I didn't think of it in those terms at the time. I know the steps of the procedure I need to do and I've done it lots of times before. I know what organs should look and feel like, and I can find my way around a normal patient's abdomen blindfolded. But Poppy's intestines are like nothing I've ever encountered.

I haven't bargained for distorted materiality. Anatomy in a cadaver is one thing and anatomy in a living person is another, but the anatomy of disease is different again. I haven't yet developed enough experience to know how far to go, to understand what Poppy's intestine will permit me to do. If I don't cut out enough, she'll die of her disease. If I cut out too much, her digestive system won't be able to function. I need to find the point of imminent collapse, and walk up to the border without crossing it. How do I decide where that border lies? I run her intestine between my fingers, scrutinizing its colour and gauging its texture as I weigh up where to cut.

Recognizing the materiality of what you are working with is central to becoming expert. Robert Pirsig talks about this in his classic 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance . He calls it ‘mechanic's feel'. He writes:

The mechanic's feel comes from a deep inner kinaesthetic feeling for the elasticity of materials. Some materials, like ceramics, have very little, so that when you thread a porcelain fitting you're very careful not to apply great pressures. Other materials, like steel, have tremendous elasticity, more than rubber, but in a range in which, unless you're working with large mechanical forces, the elasticity isn't apparent.

With nuts and bolts you're in the range of large mechanical forces and you should understand that within these ranges metals are elastic. When you take up a nut, there's a point called ‘finger-tight' where there's contact but no take-up of elasticity. Then there's ‘snug', in which the easy surface elasticity is taken up. Then there's a range called ‘tight', in which all the elasticity is taken up. The force required to reach these three points is different for each size of nut and bolt, and different for lubricated bolts and for locknuts. The forces are different for steel and cast iron and brass and aluminium and plastics and ceramics.

But a person with mechanic's feel knows when something's tight and stops. A person without it goes right on past and strips the threads or breaks the assembly.

All the experts I've talked to know about mechanic's feel, and the challenges of thin materials on the verge of collapse. Whether it's Derek the taxidermist skinning a baby vole, Andrew the engraver capturing the shimmer of twilight on a lake, or Joshua the tailor moulding the fall of a lapel, we all depend on what the books call ‘embodied knowing'.

In the operating theatre with Poppy and her typhoid perforations, I had to use all my mechanic's feel. I readjusted my sense of how hard I could pull and how much tension I could place on her fragile intestines. Gingerly, I tried to isolate a segment of bowel using my usual technique. It came to pieces in my hand. I realized I'd have to be much more careful. I liked to think I was a gentle surgeon, but I had to recalibrate. I couldn't afford to make things worse.

One of the reasons it takes so long to become expert is that you have to become familiar with variation, not just an ‘ideal' state. You have to deal with materials that are old, fragile, recalcitrant, unpleasant to touch, smelly or even dangerous. When I was operating on Poppy I was dealing with familiar materials in an unfamiliar state, like the rusted-up screws or corroded components of a motorcycle. I had to widen my sense of mechanic's feel to account for departures from the norm.

As you struggle with the basics – taking blood without getting your specimens jumbled up; inking a woodblock without causing a blot – you gradually become accustomed to the physicality of your work. With time, that work becomes less a matter of conscious attention and more a matter of routine. Your fingers stop being so clumsy, your materials don't seem so intransigent. You become increasingly aware of the intersection between you and what you're doing. This feeling doesn't reside wholly in you or your materials; it's a dialogue.

在给波比做手术的时候，我面对的是在手术中濒临崩溃的脆弱工作对象，不过我当时并没有用这样的方式来思考。我知道我需要完成的步骤，我以前做过很多次手术。我知道器官应有的样子和触感，我蒙着眼睛都能对正常人的腹腔了如指掌，但是我从没见过像波比这样的肠子。

我从没有准备好面对这种怪异的物质属性。解剖尸体是一回事，解剖活人是另一回事，但解剖病变的组织则完全不同。我还没有足够的经验去知道应该冒多大的风险，去知晓波比的肠子能允许我做什么。如果我切除的不够多，她会死于疾病。如果我切得太多，她的消化系统就不能正常工作。我需要找到濒临崩溃的边缘，然后走到边界而不越雷池一步。我该如何判断边界在哪儿？我用手指顺着她的肠子摸索，仔细观察肠子的颜色，估计肠子的质地，掂量在哪里下刀。

认识自己工作对象的物质属性，是成为专家的关键。罗伯特·波西格（Robert Pirsig）在他 1974 年出版的经典著作《禅与摩托车维修艺术》 （Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance）中谈到了这一点。他把这种认识称作「机械师的感觉」。他写道：

机械师的感觉来自对材料弹性的一种深层的内在动觉。有些材料，比如陶瓷，其弹性很小，所以你在处理陶瓷时要非常小心，不要施加太大的压力。还有些材料，比如钢铁，其弹性就很大，比橡胶还大。但是在一定的情况下，这种弹性是看不出来的，除非你有了螺母和螺栓，你就能施加很大的机械力，你施加很大的机械力。

就应该知道，在这种受力范围内，金属是有弹性的。拧螺母的时候，有一种松紧程度叫「手指拧紧的程度」（finger-tight），此时螺母与金属表面接触，但没有产生弹性。还有一种程度叫「恰到好处」（snug），此时产生了容易产生的表面弹性。还有一种程度被称为「紧」（tight），此时金属的所有弹性都已经耗尽了。达到这三种程度所需的力因螺母和螺栓的大小而不同，对于润滑过的螺栓和锁紧螺母也是不同的。这种所需的力，对于钢、铸铁、黄铜、铝、塑料和陶瓷也都是不同的。

但是，一个人如果有机械师的感觉，他就知道螺母什么时候拧紧了，应该停下来。没有这种感觉的人就会拧过头，导致螺母滑丝，或者把装置弄坏。

与我交谈过的所有专家都知道这种「机械师的感觉」，也知道脆弱的工作对象处于崩溃边缘的挑战。无论是给田鼠幼崽剥皮的标本剥制师德里克，描绘黄昏湖面微光的木版雕刻师安德鲁，还是给西装驳头定型的裁缝约书亚，我们都依赖于许多书中所说的「具身知识」（embodied knowing）。

在手术室里，面对波比和她的肠伤寒穿孔，我不得不用上我全部的「机械师的感觉」。我重新调整了自己的感官，估计了我能用多大的力气牵拉，我能给她脆弱的肠子施加多大的力度。

我小心翼翼地试图用我惯用的方法把一截肠子挑出来。肠子在我的手里四分五裂。我意识到我得更加小心。我倾向于认为自己是一个手法温柔的外科医生，但我必须重新调整自己的力道。我不能让事情变得更糟了。

花这么长的时间才能成为专家的原因之一是，你必须熟悉变化，而不只是熟悉一种「理想」的状态。你必须处理那些陈旧的、易碎的、棘手的、摸上去不舒服的、难闻的甚至危险的工作对象。我在给波比做手术时，我处理的就是一种在陌生状态下的熟悉对象，就像生锈的螺丝或被腐蚀的摩托车部件。我必须拓展自己「机械师的感觉」，来理解那些偏离常规的现象。当你在最基本的工作中挣扎时 —— 比如在不弄混样本的情况下采血，在不留下污点的情况下给木板涂墨水时，你会逐渐熟悉工作中的物质特性。随着时间的推移，工作不再需要有意识的关注，而会成为一种例行事务。你的手指不会再那么笨拙，你的工作对象也不会再那么不听使唤。你会越来越意识到你和你正在做的事情之间的交流。这种感觉不完全存在于你或你的工作对象之中，这是一种对话。

### 4.4 感官的语言

The language of the senses

We hardly ever use just one sense at a time. And while we think of touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste as if those ‘Aristotelian five' were the only senses we have, neuroscientists and philosophers talk of a multitude of senses – perhaps as many as twenty-five. They distinguish between exteroception (recognizing information that comes from outside the body) and interoception (information from the body itself, about balance, orientation, or the hidden workings of our physiology). Becoming an expert requires integration between these outer and inner worlds. Sensory engagement is what turns looking into seeing, listening into hearing, touching into feeling, sniffing into smelling and tasting into savouring. Yet the information we get from our senses is not fixed. It can be shaped by our mental and physical state – by excitement, tiredness, hunger or stress.

Even thinking about the Aristotelian five, traditional distinctions between modalities are not clear-cut. We may not experience synaesthesia in a formal way, but our senses still cross over. As a surgeon I learned to see with my fingers. With my hands deep inside someone's abdominal cavity, I would build a picture of that patient's organs, learning to recognize what felt right and what felt wrong in territories of the body I could touch but couldn't see. This happens with all kinds of materials. Not only are silk and flannel different from one another, but each piece of silk has its idiosyncrasies and so does each piece of flannel. A novel isn't the same as a PhD thesis, though they are both book-length pieces of writing.

Each sense has its own characteristics too. Touch, for instance, has an immediacy that vision and hearing lack. Looking and hearing are sometimes described as ‘distal' senses. If someone is out there and you see them, they don't necessarily see you. It's the same with hearing. But touch is ‘proximal'. If you feel something, it ‘feels' you, because you're in direct contact. It responds to your touch, even if it's inanimate. In medicine, this is especially obvious. You can't examine a conscious patient without them being aware of you touching them. It's the same whenever your work involves other people. You are conveying information at the same time as receiving it, whether you realize that or not. Even as an apprentice, Fabrice the hairstylist was conveying information about himself every time he washed a client's hair and touched their scalp.

Noticing your materials requires you to ‘tune in' to your senses. This takes practice. It's easy to block out sensory information, to look without seeing, hear without listening and touch without feeling. Noticing means being present, being attentive . At the same time, you must be aware of the intersection between your materials and yourself. Experts do more than notice. They interpret and make sense. They respond to what they perceive. They act.

The philosopher Martin Heidegger captured this elegantly in one of his late lectures:

A cabinetmaker's apprentice, someone who is learning to build cabinets and the like, will serve as an example. His learning is not mere practice, to gain facility in the use of tools. Nor does he merely gather knowledge about the customary forms of the things he is to build. If he is to become a true cabinetmaker, he makes himself answer and respond above all to the different kinds of wood and to the shapes slumbering within wood – to wood as it enters into man's dwelling with all the hidden riches of its nature. In fact, this relatedness to wood is what maintains the whole craft.

The same applies to whatever area of work you are becoming expert in. Heidegger's ‘relatedness to wood' applies equally to cloth, hair or boilers. You have to become connected to the materials you work with, attending to their subtleties and nuance.

It's the same with surgery. Living organs are not inert like those in the dissecting room; they have their own characteristics and personality. Nothing keeps still. The ureter ‘vermiculates' if you prod it, moving like an earthworm. Healthy intestines writhe. Bowel is not just bowel, any more than cloth is just cloth, or stone is just stone. The small intestine of a healthy twenty-year-old involved in a car accident is very different from that of a fragile ninety-year-old with diabetes, let alone a patient like Poppy.

Over time, you get to know the ways of your materials. You develop respect and affection for them, even when you find them frustrating. But, as we've seen, just doing things over and over again is not enough. Duncan Hooson's ability as a potter is not based on repetition alone. It's what the repetition has led to that counts. He's developed a sensitivity, an ability to ‘read' what is happening between his fingers, his body at the potter's wheel and the clay he's shaping. He's gained an ability to recognize early signals of imminent collapse and take action while there's still time. He does this by attending to his physical world, by being present.

In whatever it is that you do, there are analogues to Duncan's fingers, his body at the wheel and the clay he's shaping. To improve, and later to become expert, you must develop the ability to maintain presence, even when your materials seem to be falling apart around you. Nobody can fully convey what something feels like when you touch it; you have to experience it for yourself. Textbook descriptions are largely useless – words alone can't capture when something is ‘just right'. In surgery they say things like ‘ensure that the anastomosis is under the minimum tension possible' or ‘remove as much as necessary but no more than is required'. Unless you have a lot of experience, this gets you nowhere. It only makes sense if you already know what it means. And that knowledge comes through doing, through experiencing the sensations of materiality and by getting it wrong.

That's what tells you when you're dealing with thin materials on the verge of collapse.

我们很少一次只使用一种感官。在我们看来，触觉、视觉、听觉、嗅觉和味觉 —— 亚里士多德所说的「五感」似乎是我们仅有的感官，但神经科学家和哲学家会谈到许多感官 —— 也许多达 25 种。他们区分了外感觉（识别来自身体外部的信息）和内感觉（识别来自身体本身的信息，即关于平衡、定向或我们生理机能的隐秘运作的信息）。成为专家需要将这些外部世界和内部世界结合起来。感官参与就是把「看」变成「看见」，把「听」变成「听见」，把「摸」变成「触感」，把「闻」变成「闻到」，把「尝」变成「品味」。然而我们从感官获得的信息并不是固定的。这些信息会受到我们的精神和身体状态的影响 —— 受到兴奋、疲劳、饥饿或压力的影响。

即便对于亚里士多德的五感来说，这些感觉形态之间的传统区分也不清晰。我们可能不会感觉到明确的通感，但我们的感觉依然会有交叉。作为一名外科医生，我学会了用手指看东西。当我把手伸进一个人的腹腔时，我脑海中就会产生一幅关于患者器官的图案。对于那些我能摸到但看不到的身体部位，我逐渐学会了分辨哪些感觉是正常的，哪些是异常的。这种现象会发生在所有的工作对象上。不仅丝绸和法兰绒是不同的，每一匹丝绸都有独特之处，法兰绒也是如此。小说与博士论文虽然都像一本书那么长，但两者并不相同。

每种感官都有自己的特点。例如，触觉具有视觉和听觉缺乏的直观。看和听有时会被称为「远」感官。如果有人在远处，你能看见他们，他们不一定能看见你。听觉也是如此。但是触觉是「近」的。如果你摸到某物，它也会「感觉」到你，因为你们有直接的接触。即使这件物体没有生命，它也会对你的触摸产生反应。在医学领域，这一点尤其明显。对于清醒的患者来说，你不可能在不让他们意识到你的触碰的情况下给他们做检查。如果你的工作涉及其他人，情况也是如此。不管你是否意识到了，你在传达信息的同时也在接收信息。即便是学徒时期的发型设计师法布里斯，每次在给客户洗头、触摸他们的头皮时，他都在传达关于自己的信息。

要注意你的工作对象，就需要你「收听」自己的感官。这需要练习。我们很容易屏蔽感觉信息，视而不见、充耳不闻、触而不感。注意意味着处在当下，意味着专注。与此同时，你必须意识到你的工作对象与你的交流。专家做的不仅仅是注意。他们还会解读与理解。他们会对自己的感知做出反应。他们会行动。

哲学家马丁·海德格尔（Martin Heidegger）在他晚年的一次演讲中巧妙地阐明了这一点：

一位正在学习制作橱柜等家具的家具木工，就是一个很好的例子。他的学习不仅仅是练习，以掌握工具的使用方法。他也不仅仅是在收集有关他要制造的事物的常见形态的知识。如果他想成为一名真正的家具木工，他首先要让自己与各种不同的木材，与木材中尚未被雕刻出来的形状进行交流 —— 与木材进入人类居所时所隐含的丰富可能性进行交流。事实上，这种与木材的联系才是这门手艺的支柱。

同样的道理也适用于你要成为专家的任何领域。海德格尔所说的「与木材的联系」同样适用于布料、头发或锅炉。你必须与自己的工作对象建立联系，注意它们的微妙之处和细微变化。

外科手术也是如此。活的器官不像解剖室里的器官那样死气沉沉，它们有自己的特点与个性。没有一种器官会保持静止。如果你戳输尿管，它就会像蚯蚓一样蠕动。健康的肠道会扭动。肠子不仅仅是肠子，就像布料不仅仅是布料，石头不仅仅是石头。一个遭遇车祸的 20 岁年轻人的小肠，与脆弱的 90 岁糖尿病患者的小肠截然不同，更不用说像波比这样的患者了。

随着时间的推移，你会逐渐了解自己的工作对象。你会对它们产生敬意和感情，即使在你觉得它们令人沮丧的时候。但是，正如我们所见，只是一遍又一遍地重复做事是不够的。邓肯·胡森作为陶艺师的能力并非仅建立在重复的基础上。重复的结果才是最重要的。他发展出了一种敏锐的感知，一种能力，使他能「读懂」他的手指之间、陶轮旁的身体与他正在塑造的黏土之间所发生的事情。他获得了一种能力，能够识别工作对象即将崩溃的早期信号，并及时采取行动。他能做到这一点，是因为他关注自己的物质世界，专注于此时此地。

无论你做的是什么，都存在类似邓肯的手指、他在陶轮旁的身体，以及他所塑造的黏土一样的东西。为了进步，并在之后成为专家，你必须培养一种专注于此时此地的能力，即使在你的工作对象似乎要分崩离析的时候也要如此。没有人能充分传达触摸某物的感觉，你必须亲身体验。教科书里的描述在很大程度上是无用的 —— 单凭文字无法说清某件事如何做得「恰到好处」。在外科手术里，大家会说「确保吻合处所受的张力尽可能小」或「尽量多地移除需要移除的部分，但不要超过必要的程度」这样的话。除非你有很多经验，否则这种话对你毫无帮助。只有你知道这是什么意思，这种话才有意义。这种知识源于实践，源于体验物质属性带来的感觉，源于犯错。

只有这种知识能告诉你，脆弱的工作对象何时处于崩溃的边缘。

### 4.5 倾听你的身体

Listening to your body

When I was operating for long hours at a stretch, working through the night with patients who had been stabbed and shot, I'd notice myself becoming clumsy. Instruments wouldn't do what I wanted, needles would slip out of my grasp, and I started dropping swabs. At first this just made me irritated with myself. Later, I learned to recognize that irritation as a marker of fatigue, a signal that I needed a break. I didn't actually feel tired, because of the adrenaline rush which emergency surgery creates, but my performance was starting to degrade.

Experts become adept at reading their own bodies as well as the materials they work with. They notice, interpret and act on small signals that their concentration is starting to lapse. They register when they themselves are becoming thin materials on the verge of collapse.

This doesn't only happen in the operating theatre. Like many people, I write on a computer. For years I've done this almost without thinking, the keys an extension of my fingers. But it wasn't always like that. When I was a teenager, my parents made me go on a two-week course in touch-typing. This was the era of mechanical typewriters, before word processors had arrived on the scene. At that time, typing was usually done by professionals, who had been on courses lasting a year or two. Programmes like that involved endless practice, bashing out boring exercises week after week and doing speed tests. My course was quite different. It consisted of ten one-hour sessions, one each weekday for a fortnight, and that was it. No preparation, no practising between sessions, no homework. That's why I agreed to do it.

Every day I sat in a class of twenty people, each of us in front of a typewriter with blanked-out keys so there was no temptation to look at our hands. The ‘home keys' were red and that's where our fingers needed to hover, returning each time after reaching out to press a letter. All the other keys were grey. A similar keyboard was projected on a huge screen at the front. During the lessons a pre-recorded voice would intone letters in a slow monotonous rhythm, at two-second intervals. Each letter's key would light up on the screen, and we would have to press the corresponding key on our own machine. As the lessons went on the speed increased, moving from random letters to simple words. By the end of the course, I could type at a respectable speed, with a steady rhythm and without looking at the keyboard at all. It was one of the most useful things I ever learned.

Later, though, I realized that my accuracy and speed were not constant. They varied with how I was feeling. When I was tired, I would make unforced errors and have to go back and erase them with correcting fluid. That took a long time and interrupted my flow. I became irritated with myself and the typewriter, and things would go downhill. As I discovered later in the operating theatre, that irritation was telling me I needed to stop. Yet this capacity to ‘read' my body took a long time to develop. Even now when I'm writing it takes me a while to recognize the signals. My concentration is a thin material on the verge of collapse; sometimes I need to take a break.

Pirsig says something similar in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance when he describes hiking in a canyon in Montana with his son Chris as they're both getting very tired. ‘By about three in the afternoon,' he writes, ‘my legs start to get rubbery and it's time to stop. I'm not in very good shape. If you go on after that rubbery feeling you start to pull muscles and the next day is agony.' Pirsig has an awareness of his own body in that context and makes decisions accordingly.

Experts develop an internal instrument panel that allows them to monitor what is happening at that nexus between hands, tools and materials. They know when to push on and when to take a break. Anyone who has spent time learning a skill will be familiar with that experience. As I've spent time with experts in different fields, I've kept hearing the same story. They've all developed a relationship with the materials and tools they work with. Everything has ‘materiality', the physical characteristics that determine its behaviour. Becoming expert involves recognizing the subtleties of this material world.

By spending time with materials, you come to understand their nature and learn about your own. As I've pointed out in my example of typing, even apparently abstract activities like writing have a strong physical element. If you focus your attention on your body, you become aware of the feel of the pen in your hand, the texture of the paper you're writing on, or irregularities in the computer keyboard under your fingertips and the click of the keys as you type. Yet in descriptions of expert practice, the senses of touch, hearing and smell are often overlooked.

Developing this awareness is a long process and there are no shortcuts. Through familiarity, however, you will begin to understand how far you can push things and when you need to back off. Gaining fluency in the language of your senses is the next step on the path to becoming expert.

当我连续长时间地手术，整夜为被刺伤或枪击的患者忙碌时，我发现自己会变得笨拙起来。器械会不听使唤，针头会滑落，我会开始拿不稳棉签。一开始，这种情况会让我对自己很恼火。后来，我意识到，这种恼火是疲劳的标志，是我需要休息的信号。因为紧急手术带来肾上腺素飙升，所以我其实并不觉得累，但我的水平开始下降。

专家会变得善于读懂自己的身体，就像善于读懂自己的工作对象一样。他们会注意到自己的注意力开始涣散的细微迹象，并采取行动。当自己变得像脆弱的、处于崩溃边缘的工作对象时，他们也会发现。

这种事不只是会发生在手术室里。像许多人一样，我也在电脑上写作。多年以来，我写作时几乎不假思索，键盘就像我手指的延伸一样。但是情况并非总是如此。我十几岁的时候，父母曾让我参加一门为期两周的盲打课。那是机械打字机的时代，文字处理软件还没有出现。当时，打字通常是由专业人士完成的，他们要上一到两年的课程。像这样的课程会要求你无休止地练习，一周又一周地进行无聊的练习，还要做速度测试。我上的课程很不一样。这门课包含 10 节 1 小时的课程，每个工作日上一节课，总共上两周，仅此而已。不需要准备，不需要在课程间隙练习，没有作业。所以我才同意去上课。

每天，我坐在一个 20 人的教室里。每个人面前都有一台打字机，打字机的按键是空白的，这样我们就不会忍不住低头看手。「起始键」是红色的，我们的手指需要停留在这个键的上方，每次按下一个字母后都要把手指放回来。其他按键都是灰色的。

教室前方的大屏幕上有一个类似的键盘投影。上课时，预先录好的语音会以缓慢单调的节奏念字母，每两个字母间隔两秒。每个字母的按键会在屏幕上亮起来，而我们必须在自己的打字机上按下相应的键。随着课程的进行，语音的速度会逐渐加快，从随机的字母到简单的单词。到课程结束时，我已经可以用相当快的速度和稳定的节奏打字了，而且根本不用看键盘。这是我学到的最有用的东西之一。

不过，我后来意识到，我的准确性和速度不是恒定的。它们会随我的感受而变化。我疲惫时，就会出现一些失误，然后不得不回过头去用修正液涂掉。这会花很长时间，并打断我的思路。我开始对自己和打字机感到恼火，情况会越来越糟。后来我在手术室里发现，这种恼火告诉我需要停下。然而，这种「读懂」身体的能力花了很长时间才形成。即使是现在写作的时候，我也需要一些时间才能识别这些信号。我的注意力是处于崩溃边缘的脆弱工作对象，有时我需要休息一下。

在《禅与摩托车维修艺术》一书中，波西格描述自己与儿子克里斯在蒙大拿州的峡谷里徒步旅行的经历时说过类似的话。

「下午三点左右，」他写道，「我的腿开始乏力，是时候停下来了。我的状态不是很好。如果你忍着这种乏力的感觉继续前行，你的肌肉就会拉伤，第二天就会很痛苦。」波西格能在那种情况下觉察自己的身体，做出相应的决定。

专家会发展出一种内部的仪表盘，使他们能够监控双手、工具和工作对象之间发生了什么。他们知道何时应该坚持，何时应该休息。任何花时间学习技能的人都会熟悉这种感觉。随着我与不同领域的专家相处，我不断听到同样的话。他们都与自己的工作对象和工具建立了一种关系。每种事物都有「物质属性」，也就是决定其行为表现的物质特性。成为专家需要认识这个物质世界的微妙之处。

通过花时间处理工作对象，你会逐渐了解它们和自己的本质。正如我在学打字的例子里指出的那样，即使像写作这样明显抽象的活动也有很多物质性的元素。如果你把注意力集中在自己的身体上，你就会意识到笔握在手中的感觉，你正在书写的纸张的质地，或者指下的电脑键盘的不规则排列，以及打字时敲击键盘的咔咔声。

培养这种意识是一个漫长的过程，没有捷径可走。然而，通过熟悉你的工作，你会开始理解你能坚持到什么程度，以及何时应该后退。在你成为专家的路上，下一步就是熟悉感官的语言。

### 4.6「看」与「看见」的区别

The difference between looking and seeing

As a trainee surgeon, I remember assisting my consultant in an elective parathyroidectomy – an operation to remove the parathyroid glands. These are curious structures, usually (though not always) found in the neck. I'd learned about them when studying anatomy, but never seen them in real life. They are called parathyroids because they commonly sit alongside the thyroid gland, but functionally they have nothing to do with it. Instead they produce a hormone for regulating calcium metabolism. Sometimes they go wrong and have to be removed. Usually there are four of these small pinkish structures, but they are notorious for being variable in size, number and position, and for being difficult to recognize during surgery.

My chief made an incision into the patient's neck, then began exploring the complex anatomy underneath. The neck is full of delicate structures which have to be peeled apart, making sure that tiny nerve twigs are preserved. He was a taciturn surgeon and didn't explain what he was doing, but after a while he grunted, ‘There they are, see?' and carried on dissecting. I had no idea what he was talking about. I couldn't see anything remotely resembling a parathyroid. But I didn't want to seem ignorant, so I kept quiet. After what seemed like a long time, I suddenly saw what he was working on: small clumps of tissue I had completely missed. Despite learning the anatomy from textbooks, teaching it to medical students in the dissecting room and having operated on a lot of necks myself, I hadn't seen what was right in front of me.

Looking – really looking – requires a lot of effort. It doesn't just happen when you open your eyes and point them at something. It's an active process that demands your full attention. For many of us, this kind of looking doesn't come naturally; it's a skill that has to be nurtured. Noticing what is really there, rather than what you expect to see, demands a relaxed eye, lots of time and infinite patience.

As a medical student I was taught how to carry out a physical examination; I memorized a sequence. First you look, then you touch, and only then do you listen with your stethoscope. ‘Inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation', the textbooks called it. Whatever the patient's symptoms, the mantra never varied. Your consultant would pillory you if you failed to do things in the right order, if you left out a step or brought out your stethoscope too soon. The cornerstone was using your eyes: really looking.

I learned to demonstrate that I was looking by ostentatiously standing away from the patient's bedside, hands behind my back, and describing what I saw according to a formula. ‘The patient is a well-nourished man of seventy, lying quietly with no evident distress. Fingers show no evidence of clubbing, tremor or splinter haemorrhages. The accessory muscles of respiration are not in use …' Only after reciting a checklist of physical observations could I move on to palpation, to touching the patient, putting my hand on their chest, abdomen or limbs. Even then I was taught always to look at the patient's face while I was touching them, alert for tiny signals that I might be causing pain or discomfort.

I didn't understand the value of this discipline when it was being dinned into me. It seemed a waste of time. Surely if a patient had abdominal pain, you needed to put your hand on their abdomen to find out if they were tender, not spend ages looking at their face to see if their lips were blue. After all, that's how the doctors I was working with did it. They cut to the chase. They palpated the patient's abdomen and put their stethoscope onto the chest straight away. Or so it seemed.

In reality, these experienced clinicians had made observations first, but so rapidly that I hadn't spotted them doing it. Almost always they noticed more than I did. When they asked me to present a patient, they'd say things like ‘And what about the asymmetry of this patient's fingernails?' or ‘Why do you think his breathing is uneven?' – things I hadn't even registered. They would put these clues together to make a diagnostic story.

Eventually, I realized that this discipline of observation was essential. Seeing the patient as a person – rather than narrowing my focus down to one area of their body – stopped me jumping to conclusions. It was about learning to see . That was the difference between me and my consultant during the parathyroid operation. He had learned to look in a way that I hadn't. I had no reference points and I hadn't ‘tuned in' my eyes. I had never seen the parathyroids in a living patient and I didn't yet know what to look for.

For experienced clinicians, attentive looking has become second nature. Yet this process can unravel under stress. Every year at my university I'm an examiner for the medical students' finals, the last stage before they qualify as doctors. I watch the students physically examining patients and demonstrating the sequence they've been taught. Inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation. They look, they touch, they listen. Then they make sense of the information they've gathered and present their conclusions. That's the theory, anyway.

One year, after watching a student peer at the patient, then feel her pulse while looking at his watch, I asked him what he was doing. ‘Measuring the pulse rate,' he replied. ‘And what is it?' I asked. First he looked nonplussed, then aghast. He picked up the patient's wrist and started counting again. In the stress of the moment he had gone through the motions, but that was all. He had demonstrated the procedure he'd been taught, but hadn't engaged his brain or processed the information he'd gathered. He had looked without seeing, touched without feeling, felt the pulse without considering what it meant for that patient.

There's much less emphasis now on looking and touching in medicine. In the decades since I was a medical student, imaging technology has revolutionized clinical practice. Ultrasound, CT, MRI and PET scans show internal anatomy with astonishing precision. In many ways that's a huge improvement, providing detail that would have been unimaginable even a few years ago. But while it's tempting to farm out the looking to specialist radiologists trained to interpret images, there's a danger of losing touch with your patients, of missing the wider picture for each unique person. I've noticed this problem in many other fields of expertise. Relying too much on technology can blunt your senses, preventing you from seeing what's under your nose or responding to the individual you're with.

There's real value in the drill of slowing down and being systematic. Perhaps because we use our vision all the time, it's easy to take it for granted, to think that by glancing we have really seen. The term ‘inspection' gives an identity to attentive looking, and frames it as an act that has to be performed deliberately.

Yet at an early stage in your career, there are dangers within an atomized approach. You can believe that going through the motions is the same as having grasped the point. This is the seductive effect of learning components without understanding the whole picture. Once you can make a good pocket flap or cut a straight fringe, you might believe that you know more than you do about making jackets or styling hair. You become overconfident, and sooner or later you come a cropper.

我还记得，在做实习外科医生的时候，我曾协助我的顾问医师做过一次选择性甲状旁腺切除术 —— 这是一种切除甲状旁腺的手术。这些奇妙的组织结构通常（并不总是）位于颈部。我在学习解剖学时学过甲状旁腺，但从未在现实中见过。它们之所以叫甲状旁腺，是因为它们通常位于甲状腺旁边，但在功能上与甲状腺无关。它们会产生一种调节钙代谢的激素。有时它们会出问题，不得不切除。人通常有四个这样的粉红色的小型结构，但它们的大小、数量和位置多变，在手术中难以识别，令医生头疼不已。

我的主任医师在患者脖子上切开了一个切口，然后开始研究切口里的解剖结构。部布满了精细的组织结构，必颁将其剥离，并确保不伤及微小的神经分支。他是一个沉默寡言的外科医生，并没有解释他在做什么，但过了一会儿，他嘟囔道：

「在那儿，看见了吗？」我完全不知道他在说什么。我看不到任何与甲状旁腺有丝毫相似之处的东西。但我不想显得无知，于是保持沉默。似乎过了很长一段时间，我突然看到了他正在处理的东西：我完全没有看到的小块组织。尽管我从课本里学过解剖学，在解剖室里给医学生上过课，并且给不少脖子动过手术，但我并没有看到那些就在我眼皮底下的组织。

看 —— 真正地看，需要很多努力。睁开眼睛，看向某样东西，这并不叫看见。看见是一个主动的过程，需要你全部的注意力。对于我们许多人来说，这种看见的能力并不是天生的；这是一种需要被培养的技能。注意到真实存在的东西，而不是你期望看见的东西，需要一双放松的眼睛、大量的时间以及无限的耐心。

在我还是医学生的时候，我学过如何做身体检查，我把操作步骤记下来了。先看，再摸，然后你才能用听诊器去听。教科书上说，这叫「视诊、触诊、叩诊、听诊」。无论患者有什么症状，这套口诀都不会改变。如果你没有按照正确的顺序操作，如果你遗漏了一个步骤，或者过早地拿出了听诊器，你的顾问医师就会嘲笑你。关键在于用眼睛看：真正地看。

我学会了装模作样地站在离患者病床远远的地方，把手交叉放在背后，用公式般的语言描述我看到的东西，以此来证明我在看。「患者 70 岁，营养状况良好，安静地躺着，没有明显的痛苦。手指未呈杵状，也没有颤抖或甲下裂片形出血。没有使用呼吸辅助肌……」只有在背诵了一连串的身体观察之后，我才会开始触诊，触摸患者，把手放在他们的胸部、腹部或四肢上。即便在那时，我受过的教育也告诉过我，在触摸患者时一定要看着他们的脸，警惕我可能给他们造成痛苦或不适的微小征兆。

在这条原则被灌输给我的时候，我并不理解它的价值。这似乎是浪费时间。当然，如果患者腹痛，你就需要把手放在他们的腹部，看腹部是否疼痛，而不是花很长时间看患者的脸，观察他们的嘴唇是否变蓝。毕竟，和我一起工作的医生们就是这样做的。他们直奔重点。他们会触摸患者的腹部，然后马上把听诊器放在他们胸口。或者看上去如此。

实际上，这些经验丰富的医生首先做了观察，但他们观察得太快了，以至于我没注意到。他们注意到的东西几乎总是比我更多。当他们让我介绍患者的情况时，他们会说「这个患者的指甲怎么不对称」或者「你觉得他的呼吸为什么不均匀」这类的话 —— 我根本没注意到这些东西。他们会把这些线索汇集在一起，做出诊断。

渐渐地，我意识到这种观察的原则是至关重要的。我们应该把患者看作一个人，而不是把关注点集中在它们身体的某个部位，这让我不再草率地得出结论。这件事的重点在于学习如何看见。这就是我和我的顾问医师在做甲状旁腺手术时的区别。他学会了用一种我没学会的方式观察患者。我没有参照物，也没有「接收」我眼睛传递的信息。我从未在活着的患者身上看到过甲状旁腺，也不知道应该去寻找什么。

对于有经验的医生来说，仔细观察已经成了第二天性。然而这个过程可能会在压力下瓦解。在我工作的大学里，我每年都是医学生结业考试的考官，这是他们成为医生之前的最后阶段。我会观察学生对患者做身体检查，展示他们学过的操作程序。视诊、触诊、叩诊、听诊。他们会看、摸、听。然后他们会解释收集到的信息，并给出自己的结论。不管怎样，理论上是这样的。

有一年，我看到一个学生盯着一个患者，一边看表一边摸患者的脉搏。我问他在做什么。「测量脉搏。」他答道。「是多少？」我问。他先是不知所措，然后露出惶恐的表情。他抓起患者的手腕，又开始计数。在当时的压力之下，他只是在做这个动作，仅此而已。他演示了他学到的操作方法，但没有动用他的大脑，也没有加工他所收集到的信息。他视而不见、触而不感，触摸脉搏而没有考虑这对患者来说意味着什么。

现在的医学对于观察和触摸的强调已经少了很多。在我从医学院毕业之后的几十年里，成像技术已经彻底改变了临床实践。超声波、CT、MRI 和 PET 扫描能以惊人的准确性显示体内的解剖结构。在很多方面，这是一个巨大的进步，为医疗人员提供了甚至在几年前都无法想象的细节。但是，虽然把视诊的任务交给专门解读影像的放射科医生的想法很诱人，但这可能会使你和你的患者失去联系，失去把握每名患者特点的全局观。我在很多其他专业领域都注意到了这种问题。过度依赖科技会让你的感官迟钝，让你看不见眼前的东西，也无法对你身边的个体做出反应。

放慢速度、系统全面的训练有着真正的价值。也许是因为我们一直在运用视觉，所以很容易想当然地认为，瞥一眼就能真正看到重要的东西。「视诊」这个术语为「专注地看」赋予了名称，并将其规定为一种必须刻意去做的行为。

然而，在你职业生涯的早期阶段，用细分步骤的方式做事有一定的危险性。你可能会认为，走完过场就等于抓住了要点。这就是在不了解整体的情况下学习组成部分的诱惑。一旦你能做好袋盖，或者剪出直刘海，你就可能认为自己在做西装或发型设计方面拥有了比实际情况更深的造诣。你会变得过于自信，迟早会惨遭打击。

### 4.7 放慢速度

Slowing down

The Dreyfus brothers (Stuart, a mathematician, and Hubert, a philosopher) are widely known for their model of adult skill acquisition, published in their 1986 book Mind Over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer . They describe five stages, which they call novice, advanced beginner, competence, proficiency and expertise. Of the final stage, they say, ‘When things are proceeding normally, experts don't solve problems and don't make decisions; they do what normally works.'

A decade later, the researchers H. G. Schmidt, G. R. Norman and H. P. Boshuizen pointed out that ‘there are two separable levels or stages – a rapid, non-analytic dimension, which is used in the majority of problems, and a slower, analytic approach, applied to a minority of problems that present difficulties … neither is to be preferred, since both may lead to a solution'. In 2011, the Nobel Prize–winning author Daniel Kahneman described a similar idea in Thinking, Fast and Slow . He outlined what he calls System 1 and System 2 thinking. ‘System 1', he writes, ‘operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it.'

As a junior doctor, presenting patients to my consultant, I noticed how experienced clinicians would switch between modes of reasoning. Sometimes they would go through information sequentially, checking to spot things we might have missed. But for much of the time, they did things in a different way. On the twice-weekly ward round, my chief in his three-piece suit would stop at each patient's bedside, surrounded by his retinue of registrars, housemen, students and nurses. One of us would present the patient's case, summarizing the history, clinical findings and laboratory tests. Sometimes the problem was a difficult one and we hadn't found the diagnosis. At first, I thought that would mean the consultant would order more tests. Often, however, he would just stand quietly and look at the patient. Then he would ask a few questions, carry out a brief examination, then say, ‘I wonder if we should consider …' Usually he'd suggest a diagnosis we hadn't thought of, and more often than not he was right. By looking rather than doing, he was showing us a different way of thinking.

We all have inbuilt biases which can skew our judgement. There's an old adage in medicine that the fracture you're most likely to miss on an X-ray is an unexpected second one – especially if the first one is obvious. When somebody has been in a road accident and has an obvious break of an arm or leg, it's easy to overlook more subtle fractures of the spine or the fingers. What we see is shaped by what we look for, and once we have found something that provides a plausible explanation, we stop looking. Kahneman points out the power of confirmation bias – the tendency we have to make evidence support what we want to believe. We jump to a conclusion, then move on. But as we become expert, we have to counteract this tendency.

Of course, everyone struggles with learning to look properly, to see what's really there. When Joshua was struggling with pocket flaps, he couldn't see why his master Ron said his work was wrong. It looked fine to Joshua. But Ron could tell by looking that it wasn't good enough, that it wouldn't lie properly or match the body of the jacket. Like my chief the parathyroid surgeon, and my fisherman friend who could see the fish in the bend of the river, Ron noticed things that less experienced people couldn't see.

It's surprisingly easy for your glance to skate over what's in front of you, like mine with the invisible fish. You can believe that you've looked properly, only to find later that you haven't. How many times have we checked over an email, only to find the spelling mistake after it's been sent? We tend to see what we think is there, rather than what actually is.

Drawing is a discipline that forces you to register what you see. Tiny details matter when you're drawing something, and a cursory glance is not enough. You have to let your gaze sink into what you're looking at, and fix it in your memory. The artist and embroiderer Fleur Oakes, one of my colleagues at the Art Workers' Guild, describes drawing as ‘looking at something for longer than you normally would'. It's the looking that's the crucial part. Drawing helps you register what you see by connecting your eyes, your body and your brain.

Drawing has always been central to artists, whatever their specialism. In former times, the students at the Royal Academy of Arts, where I'm now the Professor of Anatomy, had a rigorous training which started by drawing plaster casts of classical statues. Only once they became proficient at that were they allowed to move on to life classes with living human models. At some art schools, tutors even positioned these life models upstairs and made their students put their easel in the basement. The students had to decide which aspects of the model to keep in their mind as they made each trip downstairs to add another detail. Although there's less focus on life drawing at art schools nowadays, many current experts went through that kind of rigour when they were training. But drawing isn't something that only artists do. It's just as useful in any other area of work.

Making a mark on paper forces you to home in on what is essential and think about the information you want to convey. We all use some form of drawing, whether we recognize it or not. If you're a pianist annotating a score, a lawyer sketching out an argument, a writer drafting a plot or a surgeon summarizing an operation in a patient's case notes, you'll almost certainly make marks on paper (or perhaps a screen) to communicate. Those marks become a way of distilling what is central and leaving the rest out.

德雷福斯（Dreyfus）兄弟（数学家斯图尔特·德雷福斯以及哲学家休伯特·德雷福斯）因其技能获得模型而闻名。该模型发表于他们在 1986 年出版的《心灵胜于机器：计算机时代的人类直觉和专长的力量》（Mind Over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer）书。他们提出了五个阶段，即他们所说的新手（novice）、高级初学者（advanced beginner）、胜任者（competence）、精通者（proficiency）和专家（expertise）。对于最后一个阶段，他们说：「在正常情况下，专家不解决问题，也不做决定，他们会做通常有效的事情。」

十年后，研究者 H.G. 施密特（H.G.Schmidt）、G.R. 诺曼（G.R. Norman）和 H.P. 博舒森（H.P. Boshuizen）指出：「有两种不同的水平或阶段 —— 一种快速的、非分析性的层面，应用于大多数问题；还有一种缓慢的、分析性的方法，应用于少数困难的问题…… 两者没有好坏之分，因为它们都可能得出解决方法。」2011 年，诺贝尔奖得主丹尼尔·卡尼曼（Daniel Kahneman）在《思考，快与慢》（Thinking，Fast and Slow）一书中讲述了相似的理念。他概述了他所说的「系统 1」和「系统 2」式的思维。他写道：「系统 1 的运行是自动而快速的，几乎不需要任何努力，也不需要有意的控制。系统 2 会将注意力分配到需要努力的脑力活动上。」

在做实习医生的时候，我在向顾问医师介绍患者情况的过程中发现，有经验的医生会在不同的推理模式之间转换。有时他们会按顺序浏览信息，检查我们可能会遗漏的东西。但是在大部分时间里，他们会以另一种方式行事。在每周两次的查房中，我的主任医师会穿着他的三件套西装，站在每个患者的床边，一群随行的住院医师、实习医生、学生和护士围在他身边。我们当中的一个人会介绍患者的情况，总结病史、临床表象与化验结果。有时问题很棘手，我们都无法做出诊断。一开始，我以为顾问医师会因此要求做更多的检查。然而，他常常只会静静地站在那里，看着患者。然后他会问几个问题，做一个简单的检查，然后说：「我在想，我们是否应该考虑……」他通常会提出一个我们都没想到的诊断，但他多半是对的。通过观察而不是行动，他向我们展示了一种不同的思维方式。

我们都有内在的偏见，其会误导我们的判断。医学上有句老话：你在 Ⅹ 光检查中最可能忽视的骨折是意料之外的第二处骨折 —— 尤其是在第一处骨折很明显的情况下。如果一个人遭遇了车祸，胳膊或腿上有一处明显的骨折，那医生就很容易忽视脊柱或手指的细微裂痕。我们会看到什么，取决于我们在寻找什么，一旦我们找到了可以提供合理解释的东西，我们就不会再观察了。卡尼曼指出了证实偏见的力量 —— 我们倾向于用证据支持我们想要相信的东西。我们会草率得出结论，然后不再多想。但随着我们逐渐成为专家，我们必须克服这种倾向。

当然，每个人都会在学习正确看待问题、看清事实真相的时候遇到困难。约书亚在为了制作袋盖而苦苦挣扎的时候，他不明白为什么师父罗恩总说他做得不对。在约书亚看来他做得不错，但罗恩一眼就能看出他做得不够好，这样的袋盖缝在西装上不会服帖，或者与西装主体不搭配。就像我那位做甲状旁腺手术的主任医师、能看到河湾里的鱼的朋友一样，罗恩能注意到一些经验不足的人看不到的东西。

你的眼睛很容易忽略你眼前的东西，就像我的眼睛忽略那些看不见的鱼一样。你可能认为你已经仔细地看了，后来却发现其实你没有。有多少次我们曾经检查过一封电子邮件，却在发送后发现了拼写错误？我们倾向于看见我们认为存在的东西，而看不到真实存在的东西。

绘画是一门迫使你记住你所看见的东西的学科。在画画的时候，微小的细节很重要，粗略地看一眼是不够的。你必须让目光停留在你所观察的东西上，让这件东西镌刻在你的记忆里。我在艺术工作者行会中的一位同事，艺术家、刺绣师弗勒尔·奥克斯（Fleur Oakes）说，绘画是「用长于一般情况的时间盯着某件东西看」。观察才是最关键的部分。绘画通过连接你的眼睛、身体和大脑来帮助你记住你所看到的东西。

绘画一直是艺术家的核心技能，无论他们的专业是什么。从前，皇家美术学院（我现在是那里的解剖学教授）的学生都要接受严格的绘画训练，从画古典雕塑的石膏模型开始。只有当他们在这方面变得熟练之后，才能进入有真人模特的写生课程。

在有些艺术学校，老师甚至让写生模特待在楼上，让学生把画架放在地下室。在写生时，在每次下楼添加一处细节时，学生必须决定记住模特的哪一方面的特征。虽然现在的艺术学校对于写生绘画的关注有所减少，但当今许多艺术专家在上学时都受过这种严格的训练。绘画并不是只有艺术家才会做的事。它在其他工作领域也同样有用。

在纸上做个记号能迫使你关注重要的东西，思考你想要传达的信息。不管我们能否意识到，我们都在使用某种形式的绘画。如果你是在乐谱上做注解的钢琴家，在草拟论点的律师，在设计剧情的作家，或是在患者病历中总结手术的外科医生，你几乎肯定都会在纸上（或屏幕上）做出记号来传达思想。这些记号成了提炼核心信息、剔除其余内容的方式。

### 4.8 整合所有信息

Putting it all together

Back in the operating theatre with Poppy and her typhoid perforations, I'm bringing all my senses together. I'm tuning in to what her body is telling me. I'm reconfiguring the information I'm gathering through sight, touch and smell, and turning it into action. Although I'm out of my depth, I just have to do the best I can. Gingerly I go through the steps I've learned for a bowel resection. At every stage I'm treading on eggshells. I know I have to remove the areas that have perforated and cut back to healthy bowel. But what is healthy bowel? None of it looks healthy to me. Yet I need to preserve as much as possible.

In the end I have to make a decision and hope for the best. I remove the segments of intestine that are beyond repair, then reconnect what's left as gently as I can. Eventually I close Poppy's abdomen, cross my fingers and ask the anaesthetist to wake her up. All through that night I keep checking on her to make sure she's stable.

As I'd suspected, that operation is just the first stage, and Poppy has a stormy post-operative course. The next day she becomes sicker. I take her back to theatre and remove some more intestine. The same thing happens again a few days after that. But eventually, after several weeks, she starts to recover. Soon we're able to move her from intensive care, disconnect her tubes and monitors, and wheel her to a bed on the general ward. Gradually, she starts to improve.

As she regains strength, I get to know Poppy better. I discover that she teaches English at a primary school in Soweto. Sometimes I sit next to her after the ward round for a few minutes. We talk about her plans and her ambitions, her family and the people she works with. In the weeks that follow, Poppy gradually builds up stamina. She starts to move around, first with the help of a nurse and then on her own. One day she takes a few steps into the sunshine. When I go past the ward after that, I often see her in a chair, reading. Eventually, at long last, she's fit enough to go home. Seeing her leave the hospital on her way back to her family and her classroom is something I'll never forget.

回到手术室里，面对波比和她的肠伤寒穿孔，我运用了我所有的感官。我在接收她身体告诉我的所有信息。我将视觉、触觉和嗅觉收集的信息重新组合，转化为行动。虽然我能力有限，但我必须尽我所能。我小心翼翼地做着我学过的肠切除术的步骤。在每一阶段，我都如履薄冰。我知道我必须切除穿孔的区域，留下健康的肠子。可什么才是健康的肠子？我看所有的肠子都不健康。但是我必须尽可能保留更多的肠子。

最后，我必须做决定，并抱着最乐观的希望。我将无法修复的肠子切除，然后尽可能轻柔地将剩余部分重新连接起来。最后，我缝合了波比的腹腔，交叉手指，祈求最好的结果，然后让麻醉师唤醒她。整个晚上我都在不断地检查她的情况，以确保她的状态稳定。

正如我所怀疑的那样，手术只是第一步，波比在手术后还要经历许多波折。第二天，她的病情加重了。我把她带回手术室，又切除了一些肠子。几天后，同样的事情又发生了。但最终，在几周后，她开始康复了。很快我们就把她转出了重症监护室，拿掉了她身上的导管和监视器，把她推回普通病房的床上了。渐渐地，她的状况开始好转。

随着波比的体力逐渐恢复，我对她有了更多的了解。我了解到她在索韦托的一所小学教英语。有时在巡查病房之后，我会在她旁边坐上几分钟。我们聊过她的计划与抱负、她的家庭与同事。在接下来的几周里，波比的体力逐渐恢复。她开始四处走动，先是在护士的帮助下，然后是自己独立行走。有一天她在阳光下走了几步。我在之后经过病房时，常看见她坐在椅子上读书。后来，她终于可以回家了。看到她离开医院，回到她的家庭和教室里，是我永远不会忘记的事情。
