## 0701. 重点不在于你

0701 It's not about you

It's 1990 and I'm in my GP consulting room in Trowbridge. I've only seen Sarah a couple of times before when she makes an appointment just after Christmas. I haven't been in general practice for very long and I'm keen to make my mark. I'm proud of my medical knowledge and I want to show it off.

Sarah often feels rather low, she tells me, especially in the winter when the nights close in. This time she's complaining of a spot of indigestion too. She thinks it's because she's had a big family Christmas with her children and grandchildren, and they've all overdone it a bit. Her appetite's been poor and she doesn't feel right, though she can't put her finger on why. A few days ago her husband said he thought the whites of her eyes looked slightly yellow, but she thinks that's just a trick of the light.

Looking at Sarah, I think her husband may be right and I start to get an uneasy feeling. Jaundice is a worrying sign. After a few more questions, I ask her to lie on my examination couch and I check her physically. As soon as I put my hand on her abdomen (‘palpating' it, to use the technical term) I know that something's wrong. As she breathes in and out I can feel the edge of her liver; it's hard and irregular. All my surgical instincts kick in and I realize she has something serious, probably cancer.

In a clinical sense, I'm pleased to have recognized the problem. As a surgeon I've treated lots of patients with symptoms like Sarah's and I know what to do. She'll need blood tests, X-rays and scans, urgent referral to a specialist and then probably a major operation – the kind of operation I used to perform myself.

After I've examined Sarah and we're sitting at my desk, she asks me what I think the matter is. I'm on the brink of telling her, outlining the steps that lie ahead and at the same time letting her know what an acute diagnostician I am.

But then I remember it's not about me, it's about Sarah. I'm not showing off my knowledge on a ward round; I'm in a room with another person, trying to work out how to tell her she could be seriously ill. She's not interested in all the work I've done to get here, or the exams I've passed along the way. At this moment it's irrelevant. My knowledge only counts for anything if I can channel it into doing the right thing for Sarah. It's not about what I need to tell her, but how .

Something warns me not to go too fast. Instead of saying what I think the problem is, I ask her, ‘What do you think might be wrong?' She looks at me for a long moment. Neither of us says a word.

1990 年，我在特罗布里奇的全科医生诊室里。萨拉预约了圣诞节后来就诊，我之前只见过她几次。我做全科医生的时间还不长，我很想闯出自己的名声。我为自己的医学知识感到自豪，很想炫耀一下。

萨拉告诉我，她经常感到情绪低落，尤其是在冬天夜晚降临的时候。这次她还抱怨有些消化不良。她觉得这是因为她和孩子、孙辈一起度过了一个热闹的家庭圣诞假期，他们搞得有些过于隆重了。她胃口不好，感觉不舒服，但说不清原因。几天前，她丈夫说他觉得萨拉的眼白有些发黄，但她认为这只是光线导致的错觉。

我看着萨拉，觉得她丈夫可能是对的。我开始有了一种不安的感觉。黄疸是一种令人担忧的迹象。又问了几个问题之后，我让她躺在检查椅上，对她做了身体检查。我一把手放在她的腹部（用专业术语讲，这是「触诊」），就知道出了问题。在她呼吸的时候，我能感觉到她肝脏的边缘：硬且形状又不规则。我所有的外科直觉都警醒了起来，我意识到她得了重病，很可能是癌症。

从临床的角度来讲，我很高兴能发现这个问题。做外科医生时，我治疗过很多有萨拉这样症状的患者，我知道该怎么做。她需要验血、X 光和各项扫描，然后被紧急转诊给专科医生，然后她可能要动大手术 —— 就是我以前会自己动手做的手术。

检查完萨拉之后，我们坐在办公桌旁。她问我觉得有什么问题。我差点就把上面那些步骤全都告诉她了，并且还要让她知道我是多么敏锐的诊断专家。

但我接下来想起这项工作的重点不在于我，而在于萨拉。这不是我在查房时炫耀自己的知识的时候。我正在和另一个人共处一室，并想办法告诉她，她可能病得很重。对于我走到今天这个地步所付出的努力、通过的考试，她都不感兴趣。此时此刻，那些都无关紧要。只有能为萨拉做出正确的事情，我的知识才有意义。重点不是我要告诉她的内容，而是告诉她的方式。

有个声音提醒我不要操之过急。我没有说我认为问题是什么，而是问她：「你觉得哪里出了问题？」她看了我好一会儿。

我们都没有说话。

### 7.1 关心的魔力

The magic of care

This chapter explores the crucial transition ‘from you to them'. We'll see how experts shift their focus from themselves to the people their work is for. At the heart of this lies purpose . Your purpose is why you're working to become an expert in the first place.

This shift from you to them is an internal process, and it often goes unnoticed. It doesn't always coincide with other aspects of development, with the transition from Apprentice to Journeyman and from supervised to independent practice. It's a shift which is challenging to spot. In some people, it's there from the outset. In others, it doesn't seem to happen at all. Yet this shift of emphasis is central to becoming an expert.

We're now in the second phase of the path to becoming expert. Now, you're applying what you've learned as an Apprentice to problems in the real world. You're no longer a protected trainee – you're taking responsibility for the impact of your work on other people. You've spent years doing time, you've become skilled at working with your tools and materials, and you're adept at navigating other people's personal space. You've been flying solo and you've had near misses. You've made mistakes and you've recovered. But all of this has been focused on you. It's been about your development, your skills, your mistakes. Now you have to switch your focus to other people.

I'll start by looking at an unusual kind of expert performance – magic. The seeming juxtaposition of serious illness and an entertaining magic show may strike a jarring note, but as I'll explain, there are powerful similarities between these apparently unconnected ways of being expert. They both rely on high levels of specialist knowledge and technical skill, and they both depend on caring for another person's experience.

Richard McDougall comes to your table at a function. You're with some friends and you're not expecting anyone else to join you. He asks if you'd like to see some magic. You say yes, and for the next few minutes you're spellbound by the extraordinary tricks he performs. Coins and cards develop a life of their own, defying the laws of nature. Things appear, hover in mid-air, then vanish. After a few minutes, he smiles at you all, says goodbye and leaves. It seems effortless, and somehow the experience wasn't weird or awkward. Richard hasn't intruded on your dinner; he's enriched it. He hasn't been showing off, he's brought something new to your table. He became part of your group, and joined your conversation. What has he done and how has he done it? What, in essence, is magic? When I asked Richard this, he said, ‘You have to realize that magic isn't about you [the performer]. It's about them [the audience].'

Richard's magic is not about dexterity or skill, although he is extremely dextrous and highly skilled. His magic is about how he makes you feel. When learning to become a close-up magician, Richard spent years practising sleight-of-hand tricks. But sleight-of-hand tricks in themselves aren't magic. Magic needs an audience and that audience has to believe, just for a moment, that something impossible has really happened. For Richard, the crux came when he realized that it was the audience's experience that mattered, not his. When he performs, he's not just focusing on what he does, but on how it lands with those who see it. His observational faculties are highly tuned. He reads and responds to tiny signals in his audience that they're not even aware of.

Becoming expert requires you to focus on the people who experience your work – thinking from their perspective and not just your own. Alongside this shift comes a growing confidence in your own personality, and your identity as an expert. You have to subordinate yourself while also developing your uniqueness. It can be a difficult circle to square, and these two changes can pull in opposite directions. We'll explore that tension in the next chapter. But for now, we'll stay with the transition from you to them.

By the time I met Richard I'd become an academic. But talking to him took me back to my surgical career. When I was focusing on the skills of surgery, Richard was spending years working with cards and coins. We both became obsessed by the skills of our craft.

I loved operating. Most surgeons do. I revelled in the physicality of it, the sensation of working with living tissue. I found a satisfaction which was almost addictive. Incising, exposing, dissecting, removing and re-joining; opening an abdomen, mobilizing a colon, displaying a ureter, resecting an injured segment of intestine or creating an elegant anastomosis. Even closing the skin with economy and grace could be deeply satisfying. I enjoyed becoming a craftsman with living human tissue. For a long time, my focus was on myself, on the skills I was developing. But I was operating on real people. I had to keep in mind why I was doing surgery, and who I was doing it for.

Over the course of my career, I've known of clinicians who put their keenness to intervene above their patients' best interests. Driven by an urge to ‘cut', as that kind of surgeon might put it, they would rush to operate. Sometimes they allowed that to skew their judgement. Surgeons like this might carry out procedures that didn't really need to be done, or were beyond their experience. Sometimes they would get into difficulties, and needless harm would result. Operating became more about them than their patients. Their priorities were distorted, and things were out of balance.

For work to be expert, it must have a wider aim. Becoming expert takes years of dedicated effort; you need to have a good reason for doing it. Of course, there's personal satisfaction in being able to make, create and design. There's a reward in doing anything well for its own sake. But becoming expert is about something grander than that: it's doing something for other people. A crucial element is care ; you have a responsibility of care for whoever or whatever you're working with. It could be clay or silver, Renaissance statues or living human beings – whatever the medium, you must respect it and look after it.

This is not a linear progression, with a clear transition from you to them. There isn't one particular moment when your focus moves from your own skills to other people's needs. It's a gradual process, with blurry edges. Whether you're a clinician or a magician, what actually happens is that you start performing before you've become fully confident. You're out there in front of an audience – doing magic, playing an instrument or leading an operation. You're scared stiff that you'll drop a card, forget your lines, damage a vital structure or just look like an idiot. That's the space in which technical mastery is honed.

But how can you ensure that the seductiveness of technical mastery doesn't override judgement, care and the wisdom to leave well alone? How can you ensure that you don't over-focus on yourself and lose sight of the reason you're there in the first place? These questions were going through my mind in my GP consulting room with Sarah, my patient with jaundice.

So I asked her to tell me more about what was going on. It turned out there was a lot happening in her life. Her son's marriage was looking rocky, and he was starting to drink again. One of her grandchildren was causing problems; she thought he might be being bullied at school, but he wouldn't talk about it. They were retrenching staff at the factory where she had worked for decades, and things were looking precarious financially. The last thing she could afford was to be ill.

The reality of Sarah's health didn't seem to be uppermost in her mind. Unlike me, she wasn't thinking about tests and operations. She was thinking about how to handle all those things going on in her family, and she had come to me because her tiredness was getting in the way. I was pretty sure that she'd got something serious, and the sooner I referred her for specialist treatment the better. But doing so might worsen the problems she was most worried about.

I needed Sarah to recognize the seriousness of her symptoms while balancing them against the other things that were happening in her life. Then I could help her work out what to do. Doctors, like all other experts, are there to identify problems and help solve them. But being a good doctor is not as simple as sending someone off for tests the moment you think there's something wrong.

本章探讨了「从你到他们」的关键转变。我们会看到专家如何将他们的关注点从自身转移到他们服务的人群身上。这里的重点在于目的。你的目的是你当初努力成为专家的原因。

这种「从你到他们」的转变是一个内在的过程，而且经常被忽视。这种转变并不总是与其他方面同步发展，比如从学徒到熟练工，从被指导到独立工作的转变。这是一种很难发现的转变。对有些人来说，这种转变从一开始就发生了。对另一些人来说，似乎根本就不会发生。然而这种转变是成为专家的重中之重。

我们现在处在成为专家的第二阶段。现在，你开始把你在学徒阶段学到的知识应用于真实世界的问题上了。你不再是个受保护的实习生 —— 你要为自己的工作对他人造成的影响负责。你已经花了多年时间积累经验，你已经擅长使用工具、处理工作对象，你对于进入他人的个人空间也游刃有余了。你已经独当一面了，你也有过几次「未遂事故」。你犯过错误，也从打击中恢复过来了。但是，所有这一切的重点都在于你，都在于你的发展、你的技能、你的错误。现在你必须把关注点转移到其他人身上了。

我开始将目光放在一种不同寻常的专业领域上 —— 魔术。把严重的疾病和魔术表演放在一起可能会让人觉得不太合适，但我接下来会解释，这些看似毫不相关的专家成长之路之间有着很大的相似之处。它们都依赖于高水平的专业知识与技能，都依赖于关心他人的体验。

在一次宴会上，理查德·麦克杜格尔（Richard McDougall）来到你的桌子前。你正和几位朋友待在一起，没想到会有其他人加入。他问你想不想看魔术表演。你答应了。在接下来的几分钟里，你被他的非凡表演技巧给迷住了。硬币和扑克似乎拥有了自己的生命，无视自然的法则。物体会凭空出现，盘旋在半空中，然后又消失不见了。几分钟后，他对你们所有人笑了笑，说了声再见就离开了。他的表演看上去毫不费力，而不知何故，这种经历并不让人感觉奇怪或尴尬。理查德没有打扰你们吃饭，反而让晚餐变得更有趣了。他不是在炫耀，而是给你的餐桌上带来了新的东西。他成了你们中的一员，加入了你们的谈话。他到底做了什么？他是怎么做到的？从本质上讲，魔术是什么？当我问理查德这些问题时，他说：「你必须意识到，魔术的重点不在于你（表演者），而在于他们（观众）。」

理查德的魔术与灵巧的手艺或技能无关，不过他的确非常灵巧、技艺娴熟。他的魔术与他给你带来的感受有关。在学习成为近景魔术师的时候，理查德花了多年时间练习魔术手法。

魔术手法本身并不是魔术。魔术需要观众，而观众必须相信，在那一刻，不可能的事情真的发生了。对理查德来说，关键在于他意识到了，重要的是观众的体验，而不是他自己的体验。

在表演时，他不只是关注自己做了什么，还要关注观众对于他的表演有何反应。他的各项观察能力高度协调。他能读懂并回应观众自己都没意识到的细微信号。

成为专家需要你把注意力集中在你工作的受众身上 —— 从他们的角度思考，而不仅仅从自身的角度思考。伴随着这种转变，你会对自己的个性和专家身份越来越有信心。在发展自己独特性的同时，你必须让自己处于从属地位。这可能是个难题，这两种转变可能是背道而驰的。我们会在下一章探讨这种矛盾。

现在，我们继续讨论「从你到他们」的转变。在遇见理查德的时候，我已经成了一名学者。不过与他的谈话让我想起了我的外科医生生涯。在我专注于提高手术技能的时候，理查德也花了多年时间研究扑克与硬币。我们都深深地痴迷于各自的专业技艺。

我热爱手术。大多数外科医生都是如此。我陶醉于手术工作的物质特性，喜欢与活体组织工作的感觉。我在那种工作中找到了一种几乎能让人上瘾的满足感。切开、暴露、解剖、切除、重新缝合；开腹、移动结肠、找出输尿管、切除受伤的肠子、做一次完美的吻合术。仅仅是用简练优雅的手法缝合皮肤也能给我带来极大的满足感。我喜欢做一个与人体组织一同工作的工匠。很长一段时间以来，我关注的都是我自己、我正在培养的技能。但我是在有血有肉的人身上做手术。我必须牢记我为什么要做手术，为谁做手术。

在我的职业生涯中，我见过一些医生把他们对于医学干预的热情看得比患者的最大利益还重要。正如那种外科医生可能会说的那样，在「开刀」的冲动的驱使下，他们会轻率地动手术。有时他们会任由这种冲动影响自己的判断。这样的外科医生可能会做一些根本不需要做的，或者超出他们经验范围的手术。有时他们会陷入困境，造成不必要的伤害。对他们来说，手术比患者更重要。他们分不清轻重缓急，工作主次不分。

要想成为专家，就必须有更大的目标。成为专家需要多年的努力，而你需要一个很好的理由。当然，制作、创造和设计能带来个人的满足感。做好一件事是有回报的，但成为专家的意义远不止于此，而是要为他人做事。其中的关键因素是关心；你有责任去关心你工作所涉及的人或物。无论是黏土还是银器，无论是文艺复兴时期的雕像还是活人 —— 无论你工作的对象是什么，你都必须尊重它、照顾它。

「从你到他们」不是一个线性的发展过程，它没有界限分明的转变。不会到了一个特定的时刻，你的注意力就会从自身的技能转移到他人的需求上。这是一种渐进的过程，其边界是模糊的。事实上，无论你是医生还是魔术师，你在感到完全自信之前就开始工作了。你站在受众面前 —— 变魔术、演奏乐器或主刀做手术。你害怕自己会拿不稳扑克、忘记乐谱、损坏重要的组织，或者看起来像个傻瓜。这是一个磨炼技能的阶段。

但是，你怎样才能确保掌握技能的诱惑不会压倒你的判断、关心以及适可而止的智慧呢？你怎样才能确保你不会过度关注自己，忽视自己做这件事的初衷呢？在全科医生的诊室里，与黄疸患者萨拉待在一起时，这些问题一直在我的脑海中浮现。

所以我请她多讲一些她的情况。原来，她的生活中发生了很多事情。她儿子的婚姻出现了危机，而且他又开始酗酒了。她的一个孙子也在惹麻烦，她觉得这个孩子可能在学校被欺负了，但他不愿意说出来。她工作了几十年的工厂正在裁员，她的财务状况也不容乐观。她最不能承受的就是生病。

自己的健康状况似乎并不是萨拉最关心的问题。与我不同，她考虑的不是检查与手术。她考虑的是如何处理家里的所有事情，她来找我只是因为她的疲惫妨碍了她处理这些事情。我很确定她病得不轻，我越早建议她转诊去接受专科治疗，她的治疗效果就会越好，但这样做可能会使她最担心的问题恶化。

我需要让萨拉意识到她症状的严重性，并帮她在健康和生活中的其他事情之间找到平衡。然后我才能帮助她弄清该做什么。医生和其他专家一样，都要发现问题，并协助解决问题。要做一名好医生，不仅是在你认为患者有问题的时候，就把他送去做检查，事情并没有这么简单。

### 7.2 良好的判断

Good judgement

I didn't even realize the need for a shift from myself to others until I'd been studying medicine for a long time. For many years, I was the centre of my medical world. Throughout my early career, I was being assessed on how much I knew. I was struggling to memorize facts, learn how to examine patients and develop procedural skills. I used the way I treated patients as proof to my colleagues and assessors that I knew my stuff. As I developed, I wanted to use these facts and techniques that had taken so long to learn.

When I was a trauma surgeon in Africa, my focus was learning to operate. When I took patients into theatre, their personalities almost disappeared. Often they had arrived at the hospital unconscious, so I hadn't got to know them before their surgery began. On the operating table, when they were under anaesthetic, I was forced to concentrate on their bodies. Each operation was a technical challenge, and I was developing my skills as a craftsman with human tissue. Even when my patients started to recover after surgery, I didn't have time to get to know them properly because I was so busy dealing with more patients.

At that time, I was thinking about how I could become more proficient and be allowed to take on more responsibility. I wanted to do more ambitious procedures, undertake trickier operations. I was absorbed in the how of surgery more than the why . Because my focus was on myself, I didn't think much about clinical judgement.

Good judgement is complex and can be difficult to recognize. When I was a junior member in a surgical team, it was my bosses who made the decision to operate. My focus was the operation. I wanted to ‘assist' in theatre, then operate myself – I watched what my bosses did, and gradually they let me do things. During all those hours holding retractors, performing parts of operations and finally whole procedures under supervision, I was learning how to operate. But someone else had decided whether to operate, and what operation to do. Someone else was monitoring the wider situation. If something went wrong, they were there to take over and bail me out. At that stage, my ability to perform outstripped my experience and judgement. I was only seeing part of the landscape – each patient as a body, not a person.

Yet judging whether to operate and what operation to do can be the biggest challenge. One of my consultants when I was a surgical trainee told me, ‘A surgeon knows how to operate; a good surgeon knows when to operate; a really good surgeon knows when not to operate.' The latter requires judgement and restraint. Your duty of care must override your wish to intervene. By the time I was leading trauma teams at Bara, I had to make those judgements for myself.

Joshua the tailor was learning something similar at this stage in his career. Joshua had spent four years learning to be a making tailor. Then he set out to become a cutting tailor. When he began this second apprenticeship, he had to learn a new set of skills. As a making tailor, his focus had been on himself and the techniques he was trying to master. That's when he was struggling to make pocket flaps and buttonholes; he spent years doing boring repetitive tasks of no apparent value at the time. By the end of that apprenticeship, he had mastered the technical aspects of his craft and become a skilled professional jacket-maker. Like me, his focus had been on his own skills.

As a customer or client ordering a bespoke suit, you never see making tailors and they don't see you, any more than a patient sees what goes on behind the scenes in an operating theatre. But a cutting tailor spends much of their time with customers. During a fitting, Joshua seems utterly at ease and unhurried, whatever else is going on in his life. The outside world fades away as he talks about this or that. Yet whether he's chatting about cricket or textile patterns, his conversation isn't just padding. It's how he builds relationships. He makes it clear to each client that they have his undivided attention. During a first visit he may show some sample books, registering the tiny cues that show what cloth that person likes and when they are just being polite. Like Richard the magician with his audience, Joshua is reading his client acutely. All the time, he's watching, thinking and taking mental notes. He's storing up those fine-grained observations to call upon later.

During each fitting Joshua walks round his customer, making occasional chalk marks on the embryonic jacket. Sometimes he starts to dismantle it there and then – ‘ripping the jacket down', as tailors call this process – by snipping the tacking stitches which hold collar or sleeve in place, and pulling the elements apart so they can be reassembled with adjustments at the next fitting. This emphasizes to the client that Joshua is making that suit just for them – their body, their needs and their way of life. The garment reflects Joshua's understanding of why that person has come to have a suit or jacket made in the first place.

This is uncannily like being a doctor. First you listen, then you speak. When I became a GP, I moved from medicine's equivalent of a making tailor to that of a cutting tailor. The dexterity skills I had worked so hard to acquire moved into the background. It was no longer the operating theatre that defined me, but my consulting room instead.

在学医很久之后，我才意识到有必要将关注点从自己转移到别人身上。多年以来，我的医学世界的中心一直是自己。在我早期的职业生涯中，别人总会根据我的知识水平来评价我。我一直在努力记忆事实性知识，学习如何给患者做检查，培养各项操作技能。我用我治疗患者的方式向我的同事和评价我的人证明我是懂行的。随着我的进步，我想要把花了那么长时间学来的知识和技能付诸实践。

我在非洲做创伤外科医生时，我的关注点是学习做手术。我把患者送进手术室时，他们的个性几乎完全消失了。他们来到医院时常常是不省人事的，所以在手术开始前我不了解他们。在手术台上，他们处于麻醉状态，我必须把注意力集中在他们的身体上。每次手术都是一次技能的挑战，而我在借此发展自己作为修复人体组织的工匠的技能。即使患者在手术后开始康复，我也没有时间去了解他们，因为我要处理更多的患者。

那时候，我考虑的是怎样才能让自己变得更熟练，能够被赋予更多的责任。我想做更有挑战性的手术，更复杂的手术。我专注于如何做手术，而不是为什么做手术。因为我的注意力集中在自己身上，所以我很少考虑临床判断。

良好的判断是复杂的，而且旁人很难发现。在我还是外科手术团队的浅资历成员时，做手术决定的人是我的上司。我的重点是做手术。我想「协助」手术，然后自己做手术 —— 我观摩了上司的手术，然后他们逐渐开始让我做一些事情。从握住牵开器、在监督下完成部分手术，再到最后完成整台手术的过程中，我在学习如何做手术。与此同时，其他人已经决定了是否做手术、做什么手术。还有人在监督整体情况。如果出了问题，他们就会接手，为我救场。在那个阶段，我做手术的能力发展得比经验和判断能力更快。我只看到了事情的一部分 —— 将患者看作人体，而不是一个人。

然而，判断是否做手术以及做什么手术，可能是最大的挑战。在我还是实习外科医生的时候，一位顾问医师告诉我：「外科医生知道怎么做手术，好的外科医生知道何时做手术，而真正优秀的外科医生知道什么时候不做手术。」要做到最后这一点，需要判断力和克制。你关心患者的义务必须战胜你做医学干预的意愿。在巴拉瓜纳医院带领创伤手术团队时，我就必须独立做判断。

裁缝约书亚在他职业生涯的这个阶段也学到了类似的东西。约书亚花了四年时间学习如何做制作裁缝。然后，他开始学习做剪裁裁缝。在他开始第二次学徒生涯时，他必须学习一套新技能。做制作裁缝时，他的关注点是自己和他在努力掌握的技能。那时他正在努力制作袋盖和纽扣孔。他花了数年时间做这些事情 —— 在当时看来，这些都是毫无价值、无聊重复的工作。在这段学徒生涯结束时，他已经掌握了这门手艺的技术，成了一名熟练的专业西装裁缝。就像我一样，他关注的也是自己的技能。

作为一名订购定制西装的顾客，你永远不会看到制作裁缝，他们也不会看到你，就像患者看不到手术室里的幕后工作一样。但是，剪裁裁缝在大部分时间里都和顾客在一起。无论自己的生活中发生了什么，在顾客试穿时，约书亚都会显得十分自在和从容。在他谈论西装的各种话题时，外面的世界似乎都消失了。然而，无论是在谈论板球还是布料图案，他都不是在说废话。这是他建立关系的方式。他清楚地告诉了每一位客人，他会全心全意地关注他们。在顾客第一次上门时，他可能会给顾客看一些样品宣传册，通过细微的线索观察这个人喜欢哪种布料，以及他们什么时候只是在客套。就像魔术师理查德对待观众一样，约书亚也会敏锐地观察他的客人。他一直在观察、思考、默记于心。他把这些细微的观察结果储存起来，以便日后使用。

每次试穿时，约书亚都会绕着顾客走几圈，偶尔会用粉笔在西装的坯样上做记号。有时他会当场把坯样拆掉（按照裁缝的说法，这叫「把西装撕开」）。他会剪断固定领子或袖子的线，把零件拆开，以便在下次试穿时进行调整并重新缝上。这种行为向客人强调：这套西装是约书亚为他们 —— 为他们的身体、需求以及生活方式量身定做的。这件衣服反映了约书亚对这个问题的理解：这个人为什么要定做西装套装或西装上衣。

这与做医生如出一辙。首先你要倾听，然后再发言。在成为全科医生的时候，我就好比从制作裁缝转行做了剪裁裁缝一样。我辛苦获得的灵巧的操作技能不再是重点。定义我的不再是手术室，而是诊室。

### 7.3 肘部以上的学习

Learning from the elbows up

It was magicians who made me recognize the shift from you to them. By that time, I'd made that shift myself, though I hadn't thought of it in those terms. For a magician, though, the shift is very obvious. Although the stakes in medicine are in a different league, magicians and clinicians both have an audience. Without an audience, there may be dexterity and skill, but there's no magic, no medicine. To succeed, you have to bring your audience with you.

By the time I first met Richard, I was at Imperial College London, running a master's programme in surgical education. Richard is one of the UK's leading close-up magicians, with awards galore. He's a member of the Inner Magic Circle (Gold Star) and a former World Open Champion for close-up magic. He has given shows for the Queen and the Prince of Wales, and he performs around the world. Watching him work is uncanny. Of course the tricks that he does are impressive. Like all magicians at his level, he is a master of the apparently impossible. But even more remarkable is how he manages an audience, his ability to read people. This is a skill he's perfected over decades.

As a magician, Richard told me, your audience – whether it's of one or a thousand – needs to believe you are doing something impossible. During his early years, Richard set out to learn how to engage the people watching him; to capture and manage their attention. ‘Magic isn't just about giving the wrong information,' he said. ‘What magicians are very good at is making the unimportant seem incredibly important – and what's absolutely critical, very unimportant.'

Richard started learning magic at the age of six. When he was eight he ‘retired', as he put it. A couple of years later he came out of retirement and got back to it in earnest. He began with the skills of physical manipulation, working with coins, cards and cups. Richard calls that ‘learning from the elbows down'.

When Richard was learning it was all from books, but now there are videos online that allow you to copy an expert. Lots of beginners become very good at this. But however dextrous you are, moves are just moves unless there is an audience. There is no magic unless someone is watching. The experience of magic is jointly constituted. That happens ‘from the elbows up', and that's where Richard's real mastery lies.

When Richard performs, he creates a space where he engages with his audience. He uses his personality and charm to direct the audience's attention where he wants it. That establishes a place that is very close to where the audience is looking but which they are unaware of. As a magician, you have to understand how to move the spotlight of attention, to recognize where your audience is looking, and to make use of those spots of perceptual blindness as you perform a trick.

‘It's like boxing,' Richard told me. ‘Some positions suggest attack, others suggest defence. A boxer will feint, looking as if he's going to throw a punch. He'll create a space, then come in with the other hand. A magician does that too. You're creating a moment in an audience's mind where they think, "Something's about to happen, I've really got to watch this." But perhaps nothing happens, so they relax. And when their radar is lowered a little bit, that's when you can do something. Then you raise their attention again. These waves of attention and inattention that a magician learns to create are what allows him to make the technical moves imperceptible. It's not purely dexterity, there's a lot more going on.'

So how did Richard become the expert performer he is? He started with doing time. He cut his teeth in London's first ‘magic restaurant', decades ago. He performed there at tables five days a week, with a thirteen-hour stretch on Saturdays. At that point he had mastered the dexterity, the ‘tricks'. He had become an expert from the elbows down. But already that side of things was becoming repetitive and tedious, doing the same thing night after night.

He could have started to freewheel, relying on the well-worn skills he had mastered. Instead, he focused on becoming equally expert from the elbows up – on becoming an expert performer. He set himself challenges, like how to use body language to get a cocky young executive to sit back and relax, or make a powerful CEO lean forward and take notice. He could have spent his time developing fancier tricks – daring feats of dexterity that pushed the limits of his ability. But would the cocky executive or the powerful CEO have realized that one trick is physically harder than another? After all, if you do things right, your audience shouldn't be aware of any difficulty in the first place. So, rather than striving towards an arbitrary technical goal, Richard used those restaurant years as an experimental laboratory for learning to manage an audience.

Richard also talks about the importance of silence. ‘A lot of magicians think that if the audience are not clapping or laughing, they're not enjoying it,' he told me. ‘But that's not necessarily the case at all. That's a harsh lesson. Silence does feel awkward, but actually people are thinking, they're evaluating, they're processing. Silence is massively useful, providing it's done with warmth and sensitivity.' Every trick, he said, needs time to land. Lots of magicians are in a hurry to do the next one. But that's a mistake.

As a doctor, becoming comfortable with silence is equally important – and equally difficult to learn. That's what I was doing with Sarah in my consulting room, as I waited for her to process our conversation. Silence is not just the absence of speech; it provides space for a different kind of communication. As the GP and psychotherapist John Launer put it to me once, ‘Two silences can also be a conversation.' But we tend to leap in and talk instead of listening. We shy away from silence and we rush to fill the space.

When we listen instead of talking, our attention is where it should be – on those our work is for. Listening, then, is a hallmark of being expert. We cannot be in broadcast mode all the time. When we are doing something for others, we need to be quiet and pay attention. The communicative aspects of our work, the ebb and flow between performer and audience, require transmission, reception and silence.

The best advice Richard's magic teacher gave him was to go and see other magicians perform – but to watch the spectators, not the performer. Standing towards the back of a crowd, Richard learned to recognize the tiny signals of an audience's involvement. He registered those telltale flickers of an eye that show when someone is not completely absorbed. He taught himself to read each audience's collective response. Then he applied this to his own performance. He became like a shepherd corralling sheep, guiding them towards their pen and recognizing when they were moving as one. He came to understand how to steer them to where he wanted them to go, mentally as well as physically.

Magicians have a dictum about audiences: ‘If you want them to look at something, look at it ; if you want them to look at you, look at them .' It never fails. If you look at someone, they can't help looking at you; it's hard-wired into us as humans. And this apparently simple insight turns out to be remarkably powerful. When you can shape and direct someone's attention, you can apply that skill to all kinds of settings, from social gatherings to a professional performance.

But the dictum has a corollary. If you don't want them to look at something, don't look at it. Anyone who has consulted a doctor, a financial adviser, or been for a job interview knows what it's like when someone fixes their eyes on a computer screen instead of engaging with you. You are drawn to what they are looking at, whether you can see it or not. The invisible thread between you and them has been broken.

Showing that your attention is on something other than the person you are with sends powerful signals that you are not interested. Yet, as a professional, it's easy to focus on the requirements of your job, such as entering data into a computer system or looking something up online, rather than thinking of the experience of the person you're with.

As you become expert, the component skills of your craft must become instinctive. Returning to the theories we examined in Chapter 3 , you'll remember that we move from a cognitive through an associative to an autonomous stage of becoming expert, eventually gaining enough experience for the ‘doing' to look after itself. At the Royal College of Music, they say that when you go out on stage as a student, you must have practised so much that your best performance is good enough. But when you go out there as a professional, your worst performance must be good enough. That involves going far beyond the point at which you think you have perfected what you're going to play. You must be able to rely on your skills whatever happens, even if you're terrified or insecure, or things go unexpectedly wrong.

The textbooks refer to this as ‘over-learning'. You have to be able to perform under all circumstances, but especially when you have additional challenges. You must be able to carve, cut or sew not only when your materials and tools are compliant and of high quality, but also when there are flaws in the stone or wood, or your instruments are blunt or missing. You must be able to perform when your body is below par; when you're tired, unwell, stressed or anxious. You have to know what it feels like to be at or beyond the edge of what you are used to – or what you, your materials and the situation will tolerate without falling apart. You have to satisfy the audience, regardless of how you are feeling.

魔术师让我意识到了「从你到他们」的转变。那时，我自已已经做了这样的转变，不过我没有用这种方式思考过那些问题。然而，对于魔术师来说，这种转变是非常明显的。虽然魔术与医学所涉及的风险天差地别，但魔术师和医生都有自己的受众。如果没有受众，可能灵巧的手法与技能也会存在，但魔术和医学已不复存在了。要想成功，你就必须心怀受众。

第一次见到理查德时，我正在伦敦帝国理工学院开办外科教育硕士课程。理查德是英国顶尖的近景魔术师，获奖无数。他是英国魔术内圈（Inner Magic Circle）的金星成员，也是前世界近景魔术公开赛冠军。他曾为英国女王和威尔士亲王表演，并且在世界各地演出。他的表演简直不可思议。当然，他表演的戏法让人难以忘怀。就像所有他这个级别的魔术师一样，他是一个把不可能变为可能的大师。但是，更难能可贵的是他把握观众、阅读人心的能力。这是他几十年来不断完善的技能。

理查德告诉我，对魔术师来说，观众（无论是一个还是一千个）需要相信你在做不可能完成的事情。在早年间，理查德就开始学习如何吸引那些观看他表演的人，如何吸引并抓住他们的注意力。「魔术不仅是提供错误的信息，」他说，「魔术师最擅长的就是把不重要的事情变得极其重要 —— 却把最关键的东西变得毫不起眼。」

理查德从六岁开始学习魔术。用他自己的话说，他在八岁时就「退休」了。几年后，他复出了，全心全意地投入魔术。他从操纵物体（比如硬币、扑克和杯子）的技巧开始学起。理查德称之为「肘部以下的学习」。

当时，理查德是从书本上学习的，但现在网上有许多视频，可以让你模仿专家。很多初学者都很擅长模仿专家。但是，无论你的双手多么灵巧，如果没有观众，把戏就只是把戏而已。如果没有人看，就没有魔术。魔术的体验是双方共同创造的。这种现象「来自肘部以上」，这才是理查德真正的高明之处。

在理查德表演的时候，他创造了一个与观众互动的空间。他用自己的个性与魅力将观众的注意力引导到他想要的地方。这样一来，他在观众的眼皮底下创造了一个盲点，而观众却没有意识到这个盲点。作为一个魔术师，你必须知道如何转移注意力的焦点，意识到观众在看什么，在表演戏法的时候利用这些感知盲点。

「这就像拳击一样，」理查德告诉我，「有些姿势暗示进攻，有些则暗示防守。拳击手会佯攻，就像要出拳似的。他会虚晃一枪，然后用另一只手出拳。魔术师也会这样做。你要在片刻间让观众产生这样的想法 ——‘有些事情就要发生了，我可得好好看看'。但也许什么都没发生，所以他们放松警惕了。当他们放松警惕的时候，你就可以趁机做些事情了。然后你要再次引起他们的注意。魔术师学会了制造注意力的波动，使他们的技巧不被察觉。这不仅仅需要灵巧的双手，还有很多事情要做。」那么，理查德是如何成为如此专业的表演者的呢？他是从积累开始做起的。几十年前，他曾在伦敦第一家「魔术餐厅」积累经验。他每周在餐桌前表演五天，周六则会一连表演 13 个小时。那时，他的双手已经很灵巧了，已经掌握了那些「把戏」。他已经成了「肘部以下」的专家。但是，这些事情已经变得重复、乏味了，他只是在日复一日地做同样的事情。

他本可以依靠已经掌握的娴熟技能，随心所欲地表演。但是，他在「肘部以上」的技能也开始变得同样专业了 —— 他成了一名专业的表演者。他开始挑战自己，比如用肢体语言让趾高气扬的年轻高管安稳地坐着、放松，或者让位高权重的 CEO 身体前倾、聚精会神。他本可以把时间花在学习更花哨的把戏上 —— 一些大胆巧妙的花招，考验自己能力的极限。然而，那个自大的高管或有权势的 CEO 是否会意识到某种把戏的难度更高？毕竟，如果你做得很好，观众根本就不会意识到这有任何困难。所以，理查德并没有随便将某个技术上的目标作为奋斗方向，而是将那些在餐厅工作的岁月作为实验室，用来学习如何控制观众。

理查德也谈到了沉默的重要性。「很多魔术师认为，如果观众不鼓掌、不笑，那就说明他们不喜欢这场表演，」他说，「但事实并不一定如此。这是一个残酷的教训。沉默确实会让人感到尴尬，但实际上观众在思考，他们在评估、理解。只要用温暖的态度与敏锐的觉察去对待沉默，沉默就非常有用。」他说，每种把戏都需要时间才能被观众理解。许多魔术师都会急匆匆地去施展下一个把戏，但这是错的。

作为医生，从容应对沉默也同样重要 —— 也同样难以做到。这就是我和萨拉在诊室里要做的事情。当时我正在等她思考我们的谈话。沉默不只是没有说话，而是为另一种不同的交流提供了空间。全科医生兼心理治疗师约翰·劳纳（John Launer）曾对我说：「两次沉默也可以是一次对话。」但是，我们总是倾向于打破沉默、开口讲话，而不是倾听。我们会回避沉默，匆忙地把这种交流的空间填满。

如果我们倾听而不说话，我们的注意力就会放在该在的地方 —— 我们工作的初衷。因此，倾听是专家的标志。我们不能总像广播一样聒噪。当我们为别人做事时，我们需要安静、专注。工作中的沟通、表演者和观众之间的交流，都要传达、接收信息，以及沉默。

理查德的魔术老师给他的最好的建议是，去看看其他魔术师的表演 —— 不是看表演者，而是看观众。理查德站在人群的后面，学会了分辨观众全情投入表演的微小信号。他注意到，如果一个人没有全神贯注，眼睛就会有明显的闪烁。他学会了解读观众的集体反应。然后他把学到的这一点运用在自己的表演中。他变得像一个驱赶羊群的牧羊人，引导羊群走向羊圈，并且分辨观众何时在像羊群一样统一行动。他逐渐明白了如何向着自己想要的方向引导观众的心理和身体。

魔术师有一句关于观众的格言：「如果你想要他们看某样东西，你就要看它；如果你想要他们看你，你就要看他们。」这句话屡试不爽。如果你看向某人，他们就会情不自禁地看你，这是我们人类的本能。事实证明，这个看起来很简单的道理有着非常强大的力量。如果你能影响和引导别人的注意力，你就能将这种技能运用到各种场合 —— 从社交聚会到专业表演。

这句格言能产生一个推论：如果你不想让他们看某样东西，那你就不要看它。任何咨询过医生、金融顾问或参加过面试的人都知道，当对方的眼睛盯着电脑屏幕而不与你交流时是什么感觉。你会被他们所看的东西吸引，不论你是否能看到。你和他们之间无形的联结被打破了。

将注意力放在其他事物而不是你面前的人上，就会发出一个强有力的信号：你对这个人不感兴趣。然而，作为专业人士，你很容易把注意力集中在工作的要求上，比如将数据输入计算机系统，或在网上查找资料，而不考虑你身边的人的感受。

随着你成为专家，专业技能的各种组成部分必须成为本能。回顾我们在第 3 章讨论过的各个理论，你应该还记得我们会从认知阶段进入联想阶段，再进入成为专家的自动化阶段，最后我们会获得足够的经验，让「做事」的过程自动运行。皇家音乐学院有句俗话说，如果你作为学生登台演出，那你一定曾经勤学苦练，你最好的表现是足够好的；但是如果你作为专业人士登台演出，你最差的表现都必须是足够好的。这意味着你要远远超过你认为能够完美弹奏表演曲目的水平。无论发生什么事，即使你感到害怕、没有安全感，或者担心事情出差错，你都必须能够依靠自己的技能。

教科书将这种现象称为「过度学习」。你必须在任何情况下都表现出色，尤其是在面临额外的挑战时。你不仅要在材料优良、工具称手的情况下胜任雕刻、切割、缝纫的工作，而且要在石头、木料有瑕疵，工具不够锋利或遗失的情况下完成同样的任务。你必须在身体状况不佳时表现良好，在疲惫、不适、紧张或焦虑时发挥稳定。你必须知道处于舒适区的边缘或离开舒适区的感觉 —— 也就是你、工作对象以及工作情况能够容忍多大程度的考验而不崩溃。无论你有什么感受，你都必须让观众满意。

### 7.4 难忘的表演

A performance to remember

You also have to shape how people will remember an encounter, whether a magic show or a consultation with a doctor. Will Houstoun, another magician I've worked with, says that every magic trick takes place three times. The first is when the magician does it. The second is when an audience member thinks about it afterwards, replaying it in their mind and trying to work out what happened. The third time is when they tell someone else about it. Each time, the story changes slightly. Expert magicians are adept at shaping things so their audience remembers what the performer wants, rather than what actually happened.

It's not only magicians who do this. Experts design the conditions for selective recollection, focusing attention on some areas and directing it away from others. Though people don't go to the doctor to be entertained, they should still leave with a positive impression of the encounter, even though studies show that patients retain little of what was actually said. What they do remember is how the consultation made them feel. When someone leaves, they need to do so with the sense that the consultation has helped, and to feel that the doctor has attended to their experience and cared for them. They need to feel that the consultation hasn't been about the doctor, but about them.

This isn't only true for doctors and magicians, of course. It holds true for every realm of expert practice where there is a performance component. It's remembering how having a builder in our house made us feel, long after the job itself is finished. It's why people return to Fabrice the hairstylist – it's not simply that they liked the style he gave them; they remember enjoying having him cut their hair.

你还必须塑造人们对于某次经历的记忆，无论这次经历是魔术表演还是看医生。另一位与我一起工作过的魔术师威尔·胡斯顿（Will Houstoun）说过，每个魔术把戏会上演三次。第一次是魔术师的表演。第二次是观众事后回想，在脑子里回忆并试图弄清发生了什么。第三次是在他们告诉别人的时候。每一次，这场表演都会有细微的变化。专业的魔术师擅长塑造事物，让观众记住表演者想要他们记住的东西，而不是实际发生的事情。

不只有魔术师会这样做。专家会创造一些条件，制造选择性的记忆，让他人的注意力从其他方面转移开来，集中在某些方面。虽然人们看医生不是为了娱乐，但他们在离开时仍然应该有一个正面的印象 —— 尽管研究表明，患者几乎不记得医生实际上说了什么。他们记得的是看医生给他们带来的感受。当患者离开时，他们需要有这种感觉：医生对他们有所帮助，医生关注他们的感受，关心他们。他们需要感觉到，求医经历的重点不在于医生，而在于自己。

当然，这个道理不仅适用于医生和魔术师，还适用于每一种包含「表现」成分的专业实践领域。这种感觉就像房子建成很长时间之后，我们再次回想起建筑工在房子中工作时给我们带来的感受一样。这也是为什么人们会再次找发型师法布里斯 —— 不仅是因为他们喜欢法布里斯给他们设计的发型，更是因为他们记得他们喜欢让他剪头发的经历。

### 7.5 学会倾听

Learning to listen

Back in my consulting room with Sarah, I have to decide what to do next. I know what she needs medically – blood tests, CT scans and an urgent referral to a specialist. But all this is going to be difficult for her to take in. I don't want to mislead her. I can't tell her everything is going to be fine when I'm pretty sure it won't be; I have to be honest. If I'm right and she has got cancer, we'll be seeing a lot of one another in the months to come. We'll need to trust one another. My role will be to curate her experience of being ill, to shape it and ensure it's as good as it can be. To do that, I have to go at her pace, not force her to fit in with mine. I need to give her time, make space, keep quiet and listen. So how do I take things forward?

At first I don't say anything, but instead just sit quietly and wait. Then she says, ‘I've been wondering if it might be something more serious this time. Could it …?'

After a few moments, I say, ‘Maybe we've both been thinking along the same lines. I could be wrong, and I hope I am, but I'm concerned by what you've told me and we need to find out more. I'd like to arrange some tests, then an appointment at the hospital with a specialist. How would you feel about that?'

Sarah gives a reluctant sigh. ‘All right, Doctor,' she says. ‘Let's do that.' We both know that this is just the beginning of the story, but at least I'm not steamrollering Sarah with something she's not ready to hear.

As we talk, Sarah confides that she's thought for a while that something might be seriously wrong. She hasn't wanted to admit it, because of everything else going on in her life. She doesn't have time to be ill. She feels she can't cope with what a serious diagnosis might entail, because too many people depend on her. By the end of our consultation, she lets me arrange some tests and refer her to a specialist.

It turns out that she does have cancer, as we had both half suspected. From then on, the medical pathway seems mapped out – surgery, post-operative recovery, convalescence. But Sarah has a cancer of the pancreas, which is why the whites of her eyes have gone yellow from jaundice. Pancreatic malignancy is a particularly horrible form of cancer, and my heart sinks when the diagnosis is confirmed.

Over the weeks and months that follow, Sarah and I do see a lot of one another. What frightens Sarah most isn't the pain, or even dying. It's being taken into hospital and being alone. She fears for her family if she's gone. So that's what we spend most of our time talking about. It isn't my medical knowledge she needs most, but time to talk.

Later on, I recognize I was helping Sarah through an experience, not treating a disease. The best care I could give her was not in telling her about the science behind the drugs that would slow the cancer, or the operations she would undergo, or the technicalities of the test results and data. All of that played a role, and I needed to understand it so I could help guide her decisions. But my real job was to free up my attention and listen. The best medicine I could offer was to shift my focus to her.

So let's review the principles I've been describing. First, you become confident in the physical aspects of your work – cutting a fringe, doing magic tricks, making a jacket or a diagnosis. You practise, practise, practise until it becomes second nature. In time, you become so proficient that you can do it even when your materials are unruly, you're feeling below par or you're working in challenging conditions.

Then you throw your attention outwards, focusing on the people your work is for. You develop an awareness of how they respond, using the attentional capacity you have released by all that practice to notice and interpret the non-verbal cues of whoever you are with. Finally, you think about the impression you want them to take away when they leave. Your aim is to bring the encounter to a graceful close, with something you are proud to have achieved and the other person is glad to have experienced.

This chapter has explored that transition from gaining individual knowledge and skill to using that skill for the benefit of others. An initial ‘selfish' phase of becoming expert must give way to ‘sharing'. But until your skills have become second nature, you can't move beyond them to focus on your performance as a whole. If you can't make a coin vanish every time, you can't engage your audience. If you're not sure how to operate, you can't decide when to operate. If you feel insecure with fast passages when you're playing music in a group, you're not listening to the players around you or thinking about your audience. If you're trying to remember the seventeen causes of breathlessness, you're not able to hear what your patient is – and more importantly isn't – telling you. You may miss those tiny signals that give a clue to what is really going on.

Though this transition from you to them is easy to miss out, it's a crucial step as you start to develop your unique style. But shifting your focus from yourself to other people doesn't mean your own personality disappears. Quite the opposite, in fact. It's your personality that makes you the unique expert you're becoming. That's what we'll explore in the next chapter.

回到在诊室里面对萨拉的时刻。我必须决定下一步该做什么。我知道她在医学方面的需要 —— 验血、CT 扫描，并紧急转诊给专科医生。但是，这一切对她来说很难接受。我不想误导她。我不能告诉她一切都会好起来的，因为我很确定事实并非如此。我必须诚实。如果我是对的，她得了癌症，那么在接下来的几个月里，我们会经常见面。我们需要互相信任。我的责任是关照并塑造她生病的经历，还应确保这段经历尽可能地好。

要做到这一点，我必须按照她的步调行事，而不能强迫她与我步调一致。我需要给她时间和空间，保持安静、倾听。那么，我接下来该怎么做呢？

一开始我什么也没说，只是静静地坐着等待。然后她说：「我一直在想，这次会不会是更严重的问题。会不会……？」

过了一会儿，我说：「也许我们的想法是一样的。我可能错了，我希望我错了，但你告诉我的事情让我很担心，我们需要进一步地了解。我想安排一些检查，然后和医院的专科医生约个时间。你看怎么样？」

萨拉不情愿地叹了口气。「好吧，医生，」她说，「就这么办吧。」我们都知道这只是个开始，但至少我没有用萨拉没准备好接受的话来压垮她。

在我们交流的时候，萨拉告诉我，她觉得自己可能出了严重的问题，她有这个想法已经好一阵子了。她不想承认，因为生活中发生了很多其他的事情。她没有时间生病。她觉得自己无法面对严重的诊断可能带来的后果，因为有太多人依赖她了。

在就诊结束时，她让我安排了一些检查，并将她转诊给了一位专科医生。

事实证明她确实患有癌症，正如我们俩都怀疑的那样。从那时起，萨拉的治疗似乎就已经规划好了 —— 手术、术后康复、恢复。但是萨拉患上了胰腺癌，这就是她出现黄疸、眼白变黄的原因。胰腺恶性肿瘤是一种特别可怕的癌症，当她确诊时，我的心都沉了下去。

在接下来的几周、几个月内，萨拉和我的确经常见面。萨拉最害怕的不是痛苦，甚至不是死亡，而是被送进医院，孤身一人。她担心自己死后家人会怎么样。于是我们花了大部分时间讨论这些问题。她最需要的不是我的医学知识，而是说话的时间。

后来，我意识到我在帮助萨拉度过一段经历，而不是在治疗一种疾病。我能给她的最好关照，不是告诉她缓解癌症的药物背后的科学原理，也不是谈论她要接受的手术，或者测试结果与数据的技术细节。所有这些都有其作用，我需要理解这些，才能引导她做出决定。但是，我真正的任务是把注意力从这些技术问题上释放出来，用心倾听。我能提供的最好治疗，就是把注意力转移到她身上。

我们回顾一下我阐述的各项原则。首先，你会对工作的物质层面充满信心 —— 剪刘海、变戏法、制作西装上衣或做诊断。你要练习，练习，再练习，直到这件事成为你的第二天性。随着时间的推移，你会变得非常熟练，即使工作对象难以驾驭，即使你感觉状态不佳，即使你在有挑战性的条件下工作，你也能做好这件事。

然后你要把注意力向外转移，专注于你工作的受众。你要对他们的反应培养出一种觉察能力，利用你通过大量练习所释放出来的注意力，去注意和解读对方的非言语线索。最后，你要思考，在他们离开时，你希望给他们留下什么样的印象。你的目标是让这次相遇以圆满的方式结束，让你为自己取得的成绩自豪，并让对方为这段经历感到高兴。

本章探讨了从获得个人知识与技能到使用这种技能为他人造福的转变。成为专家最初的「自私」阶段，必须让位于「分享」。但是，在你的技能成为第二天性之前，你是无法超越技能层面、专注于整体表现的。如果你不能每次都成功让硬币消失，你就不能吸引观众。如果你不确定该如何做手术，你就不能决定何时做手术。如果你不能自如地在乐团中演奏快速乐段，你就无法倾听周围演奏者的演奏，也无法顾及听众的感受。如果你在试图回忆导致呼吸困难的 17 种原因，你就听不清患者告诉你的事 —— 更重要的是，你听不到他们没有告诉你的事。你可能会错过那些表示真实情况的微小信号。

虽然你很容易忽视「从你到他们」的转变，但这是你开始形成自己独特风格的关键步骤。不过，把专注点从自己转移到他人身上，并不意味着你自己个性的消失。事实恰恰相反。正是你的个性能让你成为未来独一无二的专家。这是我们下一章要讨论的内容。
