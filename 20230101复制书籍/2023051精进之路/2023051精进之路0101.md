## 0101. 专家与看不见的鱼

0101 Experts and invisible fish

When I visited Derek Frampton, he was posing a clouded leopard. I'd never seen a clouded leopard before. She was sitting like a cat, her tail curled round her, gazing at a tiny cub which looked as if it was about to run away and play. They were so realistic I could hardly believe they were stuffed.

Derek is a taxidermist, one of the best there is. He'd invited me to his house to see how he works. We were in his ‘display room', full to bursting with animals of every kind. Glass cases of birds and reptiles, every surface covered with creatures. On one table was a parakeet nearing completion, its wings held in position by threads; on another was an alligator with its jaws about to snap shut, next to a tree frog glowing like a jewel in the sunlight. Apart from the eerie stillness, it was like being in a menagerie.

I'd arranged to visit Derek because he's one of the country's leading experts in his field. I'm interested in experts and I wanted to find out more. Moving a half-finished skink from a chair so I could sit down, Derek explained what taxidermy involves.

He made the process sound pretty straightforward. You remove the animal's skin, recreate its body shape with a plaster model and place the skin over the model. He showed me a zebra's hide, shapeless and slumped in a corner. When I asked how he would create the plaster shape for those final stages, he said, ‘Well, you just sculpt a zebra that size and put the skin back on.'

It's that ‘just' that's key. If you want a zebra, you just sculpt one that size. It's obvious. But to me it isn't obvious, it's unimaginable. It's what makes Derek an expert.

Taxidermy is not a science, a craft or an art, Derek told me. It's a practice which combines all three. The science is in the precision, close observation and accuracy which allow his work to be a reference point for scientific research. Zoologists may refer to Derek's specimens for years to come, so the precise details of a mammal's colouring, a fish's scales or a reptile's teeth might be crucial in identifying new species or tracking the decline of animal populations. The craft is in the skills Derek has built up throughout his career: his ability to take the skin off an animal, then recreate that specimen's unique shape in plaster or wax. And the art is what brings it all together, making that clouded leopard look as if she's about to stoop down and lick her little cub. It's because he's an expert that Derek can combine these strands, applying them with wisdom and care to each new situation. Becoming expert is what this book is about.

我去拜访德里克·弗兰普顿（Derek Frampton）的时候，他正在给一只云豹的标本设计造型。我以前从没见过云豹。它像猫一样坐着，尾巴环绕着身子，凝视着一只幼崽，看起来那只幼崽好像要跑开去玩了。它们实在是太逼真了，我简直不敢相信它们体内已经塞满了填充物。

德里克是一名标本剥制师，而且是个中翘楚。他邀我去他家，看看他是如何工作的。我们来到了他的「陈列室」，里面摆满了各种各样的动物。玻璃柜里有各种鸟类与爬行动物，屋里每一处能放东西的地方都摆满了各种生物。在一张桌子上，放着一只快要完成的长尾小鹦鹉，它的翅膀被丝线固定住了；在另一张桌子上，有一只短吻鳄正准备撕咬，它旁边则是一只树蛙，在阳光下像宝石一样闪闪发光。除了有种怪异的寂静之外，这里就像动物园一样。

我之所以拜访德里克，是因为他是英国该领域内的顶尖专家之一。我对专家很感兴趣，想了解更多有关他们的事情。德里克把一只还未完工的石龙子标本从椅子上挪开，让我坐下来，为我讲解标本剥制的工作。

他把这项工作讲得很简单。剥掉动物的皮，用石膏模型重塑身体形态，再把皮盖在石膏上就行了。他给我看了一张斑马的皮，没有形状，耷拉在角落里。我问他在最后阶段如何制作石膏模型，他说道：「这个嘛，只要雕刻一匹那么大的斑马，然后把皮蒙上去就行了。」

「只要」就是其中的关键。如果你想制作斑马的标本，只要雕刻一个那么大的模型就好了。显而易见。但对我来说，这可没那么显而易见，而是完全无法想象的。这就是为什么德里克是专家。

德里克告诉我，标本剥制不只是一门科学、工艺或艺术，而是三者的结合。科学性体现在其中的精确性、准确性以及密切的观察上，这使得他的工作成为科学研究的参考。动物学家可能会在之后的很多年里都需要参考德里克的标本，所以像是哺乳动物的颜色、鱼的鳞片或是爬行动物的牙齿这类细节，对于识别新物种或是追踪动物数量的减少，可能都是至关重要的。

标本剥制的工艺性，则体现在德里克在整个职业生涯中锻炼出来的技能上；他能从动物身上把皮剥下来，然后用石膏或蜡重塑标本的独特形态。艺术性则将所有的要素结合起来，让这只云豹看上去像要弯下腰去舔它的幼崽。正因为德里克是个专家，所以他可以凭借智慧与细心，将这三者结合起来并加以运用，遇到任何新情况都能得心应手。本书的主题，就是如何成为专家。

### 1.1 成为专家

Becoming expert

I'm a doctor. Medicine, too, is not a science, a craft or an art, but a practice which combines all three. Of course it is founded on science, that factual knowledge I spent so long studying as a student. The craft is how I worked as a practitioner, examining patients, operating on them or talking with them in my consulting room. The art is how I made sense of each patient and the problems they brought to me. The connection between Derek and me might not seem obvious at first, since surely taxidermy and medicine are completely different worlds. But that's not the case at all.

After explaining the basics, Derek took me into his workshop, which was like an alchemist's laboratory. The room was full of works in progress and there were all sorts of animals – birds and mammals, fish and reptiles. Creatures large and small, at every stage of preparation. An edible dormouse was on his workbench, a gorilla's head hung on the wall, and an antelope's torso stood in a corner. The air smelled of glue and plaster, and gurgling noises came from the next room.

In the centre of the room was the wooden cabinet where Derek keeps his most precious tools, the ones he inherited from his master. He only has a few and he's been using them for decades. The cabinet is the size of a wind-up gramophone and has two brass-handled drawers. On top is a turntable, where a tiny clay frog lay next to some of Derek's sculpting instruments. Rotating the turntable slowly by hand, Derek can work on specimens like that frog without damaging them. All around are the materials he needs. His workshop is where the science, craft and art come together.

Derek has been a taxidermist for forty-five years, mounting (‘setting up', he calls it) everything from giraffes to shrews, from Komodo dragons to fish. He's in high demand by museums, zoos and private collectors. Though much of his work is with new specimens, he also conserves examples from scientific collections of animals and birds that are now disappearing or even extinct. Expert taxidermists, like many of the animals they work with, are rare creatures indeed.

I asked Derek how he started his career. At school, he told me, he loved art. He was good with his hands but he's dyslexic and he found studying difficult. When he was twelve he came across a dead blackbird on the road, took it home and started to draw it. He was fascinated by the bird's anatomy, by the delicate mechanism of its wings. From then on, he collected as many dead animals as his mother would let him get away with, drawing and painting them as accurately as he could. His epiphany, as he described it, came when he was sixteen. One day he realized that he didn't have to draw these animals as he found them; instead, he could pose them. He never looked back. He joined the Natural History Museum in London as an apprentice taxidermist, working there for many years before striking out on his own.

Not everyone can become an expert taxidermist like Derek. Not everyone would want to. Yet finding out how Derek and others like him in different fields have become so expert is relevant to all of us. What does it mean to be an expert? How do you become one? What makes Derek an expert , rather than just someone who is very good at what he does?

We can all become expert at something, though we probably can't become really expert in more than one or two areas. To become an expert you have to concentrate on your selected field, pushing distractions aside and focusing intently for year after year. It's a long, demanding process that takes great effort, and there's a lot of frustration along the way. This sounds obvious, but it's something people often overlook. We live in a world that demands immediate results. We are also taught to believe that talent is innate, and that if you don't show flair for something, it isn't worth pursuing. I don't think either of those things is true. Moving along the path towards becoming expert brings its own rewards: the slow march towards mastery is deeply satisfying – and, as we'll discover, it meets a fundamental human need. Besides which, you won't find out how talented you are until you try.

我是一名医生。医学也不只是一门科学、工艺或艺术，而是三者的结合。当然，医学建立在科学的基础之上，那是我在学生时代花了很长时间学习的事实性知识。工艺性则指我的工作方式：检查患者、给他们做手术，或者在诊室里与他们谈话。艺术性则体现在我如何理解每个患者，如何理解他们前来求医的主诉。德里克与我之间的联系，起初看起来可能并不明显，因为标本剥制与医学肯定是两个截然不同的领域，但事实并非如此。解释完基本内容之后，德里克带我去了他的工作室，那里就像是炼金术士的实验室一样。房间里堆满了半成品，其中有各种各样的动物 —— 鸟类、哺乳动物、鱼类和爬行动物。大大小小的生物标本，处于各种不同的制作阶段。工作台上放着一只榛睡鼠，墙上挂着一只大猩猩的头，角落里放着一只羚羊的躯干。空气中弥漫着胶水和石膏的气味，隔壁房间里传来咕咕的声音。

房间的中央有一个木制的橱柜，德里克把他从师父那里继承来的最珍贵的工具都放在那里。他只有几件工具而已，但已经用了几十年。这个橱柜的大小与上发条的留声机类似，有两个带黄铜把手的抽屉。橱柜上面则有一张转盘，转盘上有一只小小的黏土青蛙，躺在德里克的雕塑工具旁边。只需用手慢慢转动转盘，德里克在制作青蛙这样的标本时就不至于失手损伤它们了。周围都是他需要的东西。他的工作室里汇集了科学、工艺与艺术。德里克做标本剥制师已经有 45 年之久了，他制作（他称之为「组装」）过各种动物，从长颈鹿到鼩鼱，从科莫多巨蜥到鱼类。他的作品在博物馆、动物园和私人收藏家中大受欢迎。尽管他大部分的工作都是在制作新标本，但他也保存着濒临灭绝或已经消失的动物和鸟类标本，以供科学收藏之用。标本剥制专家确实就像他制作的许多动物一样，是稀有生物。

我问过德里克是如何进入这一行的。他告诉我，他在上学时就很热爱艺术。他的手很巧，但他有阅读障碍，学习对他来说很困难。12 岁时，他在路上发现一只死乌鸫，就把它带回家去画。那只鸟的身体结构、精致的翅膀让他深深地着迷。从那时起，只要母亲允许，他就会尽可能多地收集动物尸体，并尽可能精确地画出来。用他的话说，他在 16 岁的时候突然开窍了。有一天，他意识到自己不必把他找到的动物画在纸上，而是让它们摆出各种姿态。从那以后，他就在这条路上走了下去，再也没有回头。他进入了伦敦自然历史博物馆，成了一名标本剥制学徒，在那里工作了很多年之后，他就开始独立工作了。

并非人人都能像德里克那样成为标本剥制专家。并非人人都愿意做这个。然而，了解德里克以及其他像他一样的人，如何在不同的领域内成为专家，却与我们所有人息息相关。成为专家意味着什么？你怎样才能成为专家？是什么让德里克成为专家，而不仅仅是一个非常擅长他那行的人？

我们都可以成为某方面的专家，不过，我们也许只能在一两个领域内成为专家。要成为专家，你就必须专注于你选择的领域，排除各种干扰，年复一年地专注于此。这是一个漫长而艰辛的过程，需要付出极大的努力，而且中途也会遇到许多挫折。这似乎是显而易见的，但人们常常忽略这一点。我们生活在一个功利的世界里，需要立竿见影的成果。我们所受的教育让我们相信，天赋是与生俱来的，如果你在某件事上没有天赋，在那件事上耗费精力就是不值得的。我认为这两件事都不是事实。成为专家的旅程本身就是一种回报：一步一个脚印地逐渐走向精通，本身就能令人感到深深的满足 —— 而且，我们还会发现，这个过程能够满足人类的基本需求。此外，如果你不试一试，你就不会发现你有多少天赋。

### 1.2 关于本书

This book

This book is about experts and what it is to become one. I've been fascinated by experts for as long as I can remember. I've spent years watching them, talking to them, working with them, thinking about them, learning from them and marvelling at them. In the last few years I've made this a focus of my university teaching and research. I've read what others have written and I've explored theories of how people become expert, whether as an individual or in a group. I've spent countless hours with some of the world's leading experts in many different fields. I've tried to fathom what makes them what they are. Throughout all of this, it's the people who have caught my imagination – not ‘expertise' in an abstracted sense, but the experts themselves.

Having expertise is one thing. Being expert is another. Am I an expert? It probably looks that way from the outside. It's over forty years since I qualified as a doctor. As I'll explain in the next chapter, since then I trained as a consultant surgeon and spent years operating on patients in the UK and South Africa. Then for nearly two decades I was a family doctor in a country town in the south-west of England. Now I'm a professor at Imperial College London, where I divide my time between teaching and research, much of it about experts. But I don't feel expert. To me it seems as if I'm just beginning to make sense of all that experience. Having said that, many experts I've spoken to describe a similar feeling.

Much of what experts do is invisible, even to themselves. Being expert is about how you think and see things. It's the result of an internal process that establishes who you are; it's not simply defined by what you create. We seldom see how experts become expert. We might experience what they make or do, but we don't see how they got there. We watch someone perform a trumpet solo in a concert hall, but we don't see the lifetime of practice behind their flawless execution. When we look at a painting in a gallery, we're not seeing the thousands of studies that led to it. But if you want to be an expert, you have to go through a long process. This book describes that process.

I've tried to work out what makes experts expert. I've tried to put into words their apparent ease, their mastery of materials, their instinctive judgement, their ways of knowing and doing, and their ability to respond to the unexpected. I've tried to capture their commitment to something beyond themselves. This is a tall order. Being expert is something you do, not something you describe. Much of it is impossible to put into words. It's only when you've tried to do their work yourself that you get a sense of how skilled such experts really are. Theirs is the art that conceals art.

It's like the apocryphal story of the elderly boilermaker who is hired to fix a heating system that has stopped working. He arrives at the site, asks a few questions, listens to the system, takes out a hammer from his overalls and gives a sharp tap to one of the pipes. The system starts working and he goes home. The whole thing has taken a few minutes. Then he sends a bill for £500. The client is outraged at being charged so much for just using a hammer and asks him to itemize the bill. He replies: ‘For use of hammer: £5. For knowing where to hit: £495.'

这本书讨论的是专家，以及如何成为专家。我对专家着迷，已经不知道有多少年了。多年来，我观察专家，与他们交流，与他们一起工作，思考与他们有关的问题，向他们学习，为他们惊叹。在过去的几年里，我把专家作为我在大学里教学与研究的重点。我读过别人写的文献，也研究过如何成为专家的理论 —— 无论是独立地成为专家，还是在群体中成为专家。我花了无数时间，与世界上许多不同领域的顶尖专家一同工作。我想弄明白他们是如何走到今天这一步的。在这一切里，最让我产生遐想的是人本身 —— 不是抽象意义上的「专长」，而是专家本身。拥有专长是一回事，成为专家是另一回事。我是专家吗？从表面上看可能是的。我取得行医资格已有 40 多年了。我会在下一章讲到，我学医以后，接受过外科顾问医师的培训，并且在英国和南非为患者做过很多年的手术。后来，我在英格兰西南部的一个小镇上做了近 20 年的家庭医生。现在，我是伦敦帝国理工学院的一名教授，把时间花在教学和研究上，而大部分时间都放在了专家的问题上。但是我不觉得自己是个专家。在我看来，我似乎才刚刚开始理解我的所有经历。话虽如此，我采访过的许多专家都有类似的感觉。

专家所做的很多事情都是看不见的，甚至连他们自己也看不见。成为专家的关键，在于你思考和看待事物的方式，在于决定「你是谁」的内部过程所导致的结果，而不仅仅在于你所创造的事物。我们很少能看到专家是如何成为专家的。我们可能会看到他们的所作所为，但我们看不见他们是如何取得这些成就的。我们能看到有人在音乐厅里演奏小号，但我们看不到他们在这次完美表演背后，有着一辈子的练习。我们在画廊里欣赏一幅画的时候，看到的并不是催生这幅作品的无数研究。

但是，如果你想成为专家，就必须经历一个漫长的过程。本书讲的就是这个过程。

我一直在试图弄明白专家何以成为专家。我曾尝试用语言来描述他们外表的从容、对专业内容的掌握、本能的判断、认知与行事的方式，以及他们对意外事件做出反应的能力。我还想要理解他们对于那些超越自身的事物的投入。这些可不容易。

成为专家是实实在在的行为，而不是用语言能说清楚的。其中有许多东西是无法用语言表达的。只有当你试着去做他们所做的事情时，才能体会到这些专家的技能有多娴熟。他们所擅长的技艺，便是深藏不露的技艺。

这就像那个杜撰的故事一样：一个年长的锅炉工被请去修理一套失灵的供暖系统。他来到现场，问了几个问题，听了系统运行的声音，从工作服里拿出一把锤子，对着一根管道用力敲了一下。系统恢复了正常，他就回家了。整个过程只花了几分钟，而他后来寄来的账单却要价 500 英镑。顾客感到很愤怒，要求他列出详细的账单，因为他仅仅挥了一下锤子，就要收取这么高的费用。他回复道：「挥动锤子 —— 5 英镑，知道敲哪里 —— 495 英镑。」

### 1.3 看不见的鱼

Invisible fish

So how can you tell if someone is an expert? Sometimes we recognize experts immediately. We experience their work and can judge it for ourselves – in concert halls or theatres or exhibitions, or in work by people like Derek the taxidermist. Sometimes we trust in their expertise without seeing how they do it, as with surgeons, chefs or architects. Such experts seem mysterious, and most of us know we could never do their work ourselves.

Other experts are all around us, though we often fail to notice them. When we have our car fixed by a skilled mechanic, or a new bathroom installed by a master plumber, it's easy to miss how expert these people really are. Because cars and bathrooms are so familiar, we overlook the skill required to do a good job. We take this expertise for granted and hardly register it. Yet work of this kind is the fruit of decades of experience.

The perceived value of an expert's work has a lot to do with how we judge it, and this can be misleading. For many people, surgeons, airline pilots and concert pianists come fairly near the top, while garage mechanics, plasterers and plumbers come further down. Yet the essence of being expert – that wisdom that allows you to get to the heart of a problem and fix it with skill, judgement and care – cuts across these unhelpful hierarchies.

Part of the undervaluing of experts is because of familiarity – or its opposite. Taxidermy is so far outside most people's experience that Derek's expertise is plain to see. A plasterer skimming a ceiling or a carpenter making window frames may require an equal amount of artistry, craft and science to do a good job, yet because ceilings and window frames seem so ordinary we fail to recognize how expert these craftsmen are. In fact, the dexterity and precision of a surgeon and a joiner are surprisingly similar. They will both have walked a gruelling path. Yet the hierarchies that place surgery above joinery hide the common ground they share. The point about being expert is not the field you are in but what you have to do to get there.

Becoming expert, therefore, applies to us all. We each have our own interests and skills, whether driving or playing tennis, publishing or accountancy, using a computer keyboard or playing a musical instrument. But being expert is easier to recognize in others than in ourselves, whether you are composing emails or composing symphonies. Yet although experts often go unnoticed, we can spot them if we think to look.

It's like observing the natural world. One day I was walking along a riverbank with an old friend. He's a keen angler, and he was trying to explain his passion. ‘It's not really about catching the fish,' he told me, ‘it's about looking.' I didn't understand what he meant. When we reached a bend in the river, he pointed and said, ‘There, do you see them?' I couldn't see anything special, just the water with a few leaves bobbing up and down and some flies swarming in the sunshine. ‘Look, loads of them,' he said, and he told me the type of fish he'd spotted. I couldn't see a single one. ‘Just relax and look a while, and you'll see them too,' he explained.

As I stood on the bank, I let my gaze soften. Gradually I realized that what I'd thought were surface shadows were in fact fish flitting underneath. I couldn't identify what kind, but I became aware that they were there. My friend had been fishing since he was a child. He could put together the tiny clues that told him what was happening. They formed a language that he could understand but I couldn't. Ripples in the water, fleeting shadows, the glint of the sun, the pattern of the flies darting above the surface. He knew how to interpret all of this and make sense of it, even telling one species of fish from another.

Experts are like these invisible fish – all around us but hiding in plain sight. Often they are so modest about their accomplishments that they hardly acknowledge them. In this book I will be like my friend was that day, pointing out the invisible fish that surround us and live within us. I'll describe how to recognize experts, explore the characteristics they share, and ask what we can learn for our own lives.

Researching experts is a challenge. They often struggle to explain what they do. Their work has become unconscious – inaccessible even to them, and almost impossible to put into words. But they can usually show you. When you visit them in their studio, workshop, performance space, clinic or operating theatre, you can watch them at work. Even then, it's difficult to grasp the subtlety of what they do, to understand the judgements they make and the wisdom they bring to their work.

You might wonder how to find experts whose work resonates with your own and whose experience can shed light on yours. If experts are invisible fish, how can you see them? One approach is to go where you know fish will be, to find a bend in the river where they congregate. One such place in the United Kingdom is the Art Workers' Guild.

I found the Guild quite by chance. I was wandering through Bloomsbury in central London some years ago and ended up in Queen Square. This site is well known in medical circles because of some famous hospitals, including Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. My eye was caught by a beautifully painted sign over the door of No. 6 saying ‘Art Workers' Guild'. It happened to be Open Garden Squares Weekend in London, when hundreds of organizations throw open their doors to passers-by. No. 6 Queen Square's was ajar. I stepped in and found myself in another world.

I discovered that the Art Workers' Guild was started in 1884 by young designers and architects who wanted to bring the fine and applied arts together on equal terms. This was the time of the Arts and Crafts movement, and William Morris – the artist, textile designer, writer and social activist who was one of its leading figures – was an early Master of the Guild. Now the Guild includes experts in over sixty fields, from pottery to botanical illustration, portrait sculpture to architectural drawing, ornamental plasterwork to jewellery-making. In most groups of experts – a society of silversmiths, say, or glass blowers, or printers, or doctors – all members are from the same profession. The Art Workers' Guild is quite the opposite. Its membership is very broad, and many of the experts I'll introduce in this book are among them.

I became fascinated by these Art Workers. As individuals, they are all highly skilled – only those at the top of their field are invited to join the Guild. As a group, they share a belief in the importance of doing good work and also a quiet pride in having spent years mastering a difficult craft. All of them are unusual; many are downright eccentric. In the years that followed my first visit, I spent more and more time with them, and eventually I was invited to join the Guild myself.

Spending time with them and other experts – including the ones you'll meet in this book – gave me an insight into their work. I began to see parallels between their experiences and mine, even though none of them do anything connected with medicine. I was able to test out ideas about the path to becoming expert – ideas which evolved into the ones you'll encounter in this book. I've had the experience of walking down a path towards becoming expert in my life as a doctor, and I found this image resonated with others too.

既然如此，你该如何判断一个人是不是专家？有时我们能一眼就认出专家。我们能看见他们的工作（音乐厅、剧院里的表演，展览中的展品，或者标本剥制师德里克这种人的作品），可以自己做出判断。有时我们信任他们的专业技能，却没有看到他们是如何工作的，比如外科医生、厨师或建筑师。这些专家似乎很神秘，我们大多数人都知道自己不可能做他们的工作。还有些专家就在我们身边，但往往不引人注目。我们让熟练的机械师修理汽车，让管道工为我们安装新浴室，而我们却很容易忽略这些人有多专业。因为汽车和浴室实在是太司空见惯了，以至于我们忽视了做好工作所需要的技能。我们把这种专长看作理所当然，几乎不会加以留心。然而，这类工作都是几十年经验积累的成果。我们认为专家的工作有多大价值，很大程度上与我们对这项工作的看法有关，因此时常产生误解。对很多人来说，外科医生、飞行员和钢琴家几乎是最顶尖的专家，而车库修理工、泥瓦匠和水管工则要低级些。然而，成为专家的本质 —— 找到问题核心的智慧、解决问题的技巧、判断与付出的关心，则不受这种毫无益处的贵贱之分的影响。

专家的价值受到低估，其中的一部分原因是熟悉 —— 或者恰恰相反。大多数人都不熟悉动物标本剥制，所以德里克的专业性则是显而易见的。粉刷天花板的粉刷匠，或制作窗框的木匠可能需要拥有同等程度的艺术造诣、技术与科学知识，然而天花板和窗框实在是太稀松平常了，以至于我们意识不到这些工匠有多专业。事实上，外科医生与木匠所需的灵活性与精确性惊人地相似。他们都需要付出艰辛的努力。然而那种将外科医生置于木匠之上的等级之见却掩盖了两者的共同之处。成为专家的关键与你的领域无关，而在于你必须做些什么才能达到精通。

因此，成为专家的方法对于我们所有人都适用。我们每个人都有自己的兴趣与技能，无论是开车还是打网球，出版还是会计，使用电脑键盘还是演奏乐器。但是，无论你是在写电子邮件还是创作交响乐，你都更容易发现别人是专家，却不容易有这样的自知。然而，尽管我们常常对专家视而不见，但如果我们用心去看，就能发现他们。

这就像观察大自然一样。有一天，我和一位老朋友沿着河岸散步。他酷爱垂钓，并试图向我讲解他的兴趣。「是否钓到鱼并不重要，」他告诉我，「重要的是去寻找。」我不明白他的意思。

当我们走到河湾处时，他指了指说：「在那儿，你看见了吗？」

我没看到什么东西，只有水面上的几片叶子上下浮动，还有在阳光下成群结队的苍蝇。「看，有很多。」他说，然后告诉我他发现的是哪种鱼。我一条也看不见。「放松点，看上一会儿，你也能看到它们。」他解释道。

我站在河岸上，让眼睛放松下来。渐渐地，我意识到，起初我以为的水面上的影子，其实是在水面下游动的鱼。我不知道是哪种鱼，但我意识到鱼就在那儿。我朋友从小就开始钓鱼了。他能把细微的线索联系起来，看出发生的事情。这些线索形成了一种语言，他能理解这种语言，而我却不能。水面上的涟漪、一闪而过的影子、闪烁的阳光、水面上苍蝇的飞行规律。他知道如何解释并理解这一切，甚至能据此区分不同种类的鱼。

专家就像这些看不见的鱼 —— 他们就在我们身边，却藏在我们的眼皮底下。他们往往对自己的成就非常谦虚，甚至几乎不承认自己的成就。在本书里，我将像我的朋友那样，指出生活在我们身边的看不见的鱼。我会阐述如何发现专家，探讨他们的共同特征，并讨论这些东西对我们自己的生活有何启示。

研究专家很难。他们往往说不清楚自己做了什么。他们工作的诀窍已经成了无意识的习惯 —— 连他们也不知道，几乎无法用语言来表达。但是，他们往往可以展示给你看。当你参观他们的演播室、工作室、表演现场、诊所或手术室时，你就能看到他们工作的样子。即便如此，要理解他们工作的精妙之处、他们做出的判断与他们在工作中的智慧依然很难。

你可能想知道如何找到这样的专家：他们的工作能与你产生共鸣，他们的经验能给予你启发。如果专家是看不见的鱼，那你怎么能找到他们呢？一种方法是去你知道的鱼会出没的地方，找一处鱼群聚集的河湾。英国的艺术工作者行会（Art Workers's Guild）就是这样的一个地方。

我是偶然间发现这个行会的。几年前，我在伦敦市中心的布鲁姆斯伯里区闲逛，最后来到了女王广场。这个地方在医学界很有名，因为这里有一些著名的医院，包括大奥蒙德街儿童医院和英国国家神经病学与神经外科医院。6 号楼大门上「艺术工作者行会」的漂亮标语吸引了我的目光。那天刚好是伦敦的「花园广场开放日」，那里的数百家组织都会向路人敞开大门。女王广场 6 号的大门半开着。我走了进去，发现自己来到了另一个世界。

我了解到，艺术工作者行会是由一批年轻的设计师和建筑师于 1884 年建立的。他们希望将美术与应用艺术平等地结合在一起。那是工艺美术运动的时代，而艺术家、纺织品设计师、作家和社会活动家威廉·莫里斯（William Morris）则是行会早年间的会长。现在，该行会会集了 60 多个领域的专家，从陶器到植物插画，从人像雕塑到建筑绘画，从装饰性石膏到珠宝制作，应有尽有。在大多数专家团体中（包括银匠、玻璃吹制工、印刷工或医生团体），所有成员都从事同一行当。艺术工作者行会恰恰相反。其会员遍及各行各业，我将在本书中介绍的许多专家都是该行会的成员。

这些艺术工作者深深地吸引了我。作为独立的工作者，他们都有高超的技能 —— 只有在各自领域成为佼佼者才会受到邀请加入行会。作为一个团体，他们都相信精益求精的重要性，并且都为经年累月掌握一门艰深的手艺而感到骄傲。他们都不是寻常人，许多人非常古怪。自从我首次拜访那里之后，我和他们打交道的时间越来越多，最后我也应邀加入了行会。

与这些艺术工作者和其他专家（包括你会在本书中见到的专家）打交道，让我了解了他们的工作。虽然他们的工作与医学没有任何关系，但我开始发现他们的经历与我有相似之处。我可以借此机会验证如何成为专家的想法 —— 这些想法演变成了你会在本书中看到的理念。在医生的职业生涯里，我已经历过成为专家的过程，我发现这张图与其他领域也有共通之处。

对学艺模型（apprenticeship model）做个详细的介绍，深呼吸，一步一步思考

The apprenticeship model

At the heart of this book is the apprenticeship model. This has been widespread throughout Europe for centuries and has counterparts all around the world. Many people associate it with the medieval guild system for becoming a craftsman (a long-established term, which now of course applies equally to men and women, and which for convenience I will use throughout this book). Although many apprenticeship systems in the UK are being eradicated by social, political and industrial change, the model remains useful for our thinking. Historically it has referred to learning a craft or a trade, but for me it applies to experts of every kind – from taxidermists to teachers, plumbers to pilots. It's a model that most people understand intuitively, even if they haven't thought about it in detail. Crucially, it captures the idea of progression. I'll use this model as a framework throughout this book.

Traditionally there are three phases – Apprentice, Journeyman and Master. fn1 Of course, social conditions nowadays are radically different from those of medieval Europe. Apprentices no longer sleep behind the stove in their master's house or work for years without pay. But these stages provide a road map for anyone who wants to become expert.

Apprentice. You start by knowing nothing. You watch and copy others, learning to do things as they are already done in your master's workshop. Responsibility for your work and any mistakes you make lies with your master, and so does any credit for the work you do.

Journeyman. You launch your career as an independent expert. You leave your master's workshop and move around the country. Now you take responsibility for your own work, and you have to deal with the consequences of error. You continue to gain experience, refining and extending your skills and developing your individuality.

Master. Finally you set up a workshop of your own and teach others. You pass on your knowledge and expertise to future generations. You do what you can to look after the individuals who are learning from you; you have a sense of stewardship towards your field more widely; sometimes you even take the field itself in new directions.

These three phases are a useful way to think about the acquisition of skill. But they are descriptive, not explanatory. They identify points on a path, but they don't show you how to reach those points or how to know when you've got there. They divide the process into segments and treat these as if they were static. They measure what can be measured. But much that is important can't be measured. There are changes in who you are, not just what you can do. This process may be invisible from the outside. It's difficult to quantify, and may even go unnoticed from within.

Much research has focused on ‘expertise', framing it in terms of impersonal attributes and capacities. Expertise is seen as separate from the person who acquires it. Expertise is being able to make a dovetail joint or put a basketball into the net. But I'm interested in what happens internally, in what it means to become expert, then become an expert, recognized by peers, the public and the outside world. I'm interested in what happens to that person when they learn to make a dovetail joint, rather than how they make the joint itself.

Descriptions seldom give an insider's point of view. They don't tell you what to expect if you want to become expert yourself, or where to place your effort. And they don't tell you how long it's likely to take, or the problems you'll encounter on the way. So I've broken down the Apprentice–Journeyman–Master model into smaller steps – the inside story of becoming expert. These steps form the chapters of the book. In the diagram on page 13 I've mapped them onto the Apprentice–Journeyman–Master framework. Of course, the steps don't always follow in an orderly sequence, and the stages often overlap. But they provide a sense of the terrain.

01 Apprentice

When you start out, your role is to learn. You're in someone else's world, learning to do things their way, and they take responsibility for what you do. I've called this step Doing time . Your focus is on yourself – on the knowledge and skills you are acquiring. You are shielded from the impact of the mistakes you will inevitably make, both on the work itself and on you as a person. You become part of a community of practice, a group of people already doing what you aspire to learn. This community is usually supportive, though you may not experience it like that at the time. You are not expected, or even permitted, to depart from the established ways or try new things out. Your job is to conform, not to innovate. Your work involves repetition, boredom, trudging through menial tasks, and having to do things even when you don't understand why.

The next step – Using your senses – is about the fruits of doing time: the understanding you gradually develop of the work you are learning to do. You become familiar with the world you are starting to inhabit. You learn how it functions. You experience your work with your senses and your mind, as well as with your hands and your body. This applies whether you are becoming a stonemason or a doctor, attending evening classes in hat-making, learning the oboe as an adult beginner, or studying to become a lawyer, a film-maker, an accountant or anything else.

The third step, Space and other people , is about being systematic with the materials and tools you work with – ‘mise en place', as the chefs call it. At the same time, you develop sensitivity to the people you are working with: your colleagues or patients, customers or clients. You learn how to enter and work within other people's personal space.

By now you are getting ready to leave the Apprentice phase. Along with this comes Getting it wrong and putting it right . Mistakes happen, but so far you've been cushioned by being a novice. People expect you to get things wrong. Your environment is arranged so that you, your colleagues and your workplace are protected from the consequences of your errors. You start by working on material that doesn't matter, that can be replaced. You have people who will tell you when you're going off course and how to put things right. You're in a safe space. But in the next phase, that starts to change.

02 Journeyman

Now you're becoming independent – responsible for your work and how it's received. This transition from Apprentice to Journeyman entails two pivotal shifts. The first I've called ‘ It's not about you ', borrowing a phrase from magicians I've worked with. This requires a radical change in your focus of attention, shifting it away from yourself. Expert work involves doing something for someone else. Somewhere, there's an audience – a person or people who experience what you do – though you don't always see them directly. That audience may be obvious, as at a concert, a football match or a play. Here, expert and audience share space and time, and the work is synchronous. But in other fields, the audience is not there with you, and your work is asynchronous. When a potter makes a vase in a studio, there may be nobody else watching. But still the potter intends their work to be seen, whether in a shop, an exhibition or a display. Although the making takes place out of view, there is always an audience, even if theoretical, distant or completely unknown.

Whether you're an artist, a scientist, a clinician or a mechanic, this stage involves moving attention away from yourself. It's the shift ‘from you to them'. ‘Them' refers to the people who experience your work – your audience, patients or customers. This is a crucial transition, though it doesn't always happen at the same point on the path to becoming expert. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all. It's possible to be technically brilliant but remain focused on yourself; to miss or corrupt the heart of what you are doing. In my profession, the occasional rogue surgeons who carry out unnecessary operations, or experiment without their patients' consent, are often highly skilled. But they distort their work's purpose, coming to think it is more about them than their patients.

The second shift is Developing voice . I've taken this term from the world of jazz, where musicians will create a personalized musical fingerprint. As a performer, you reach a point where you are no longer a cog in someone else's machine, but a creator of expert work in your own right. As you establish your style, you develop your individuality. Now, you are shaping your work and giving it your signature. You are taking responsibility for being yourself and establishing your own identity. That requires confidence and self-belief. It's a subtle process, as it needs to develop in parallel with the transition to ‘it's not about you' without making you arrogant or self-centred. You need to balance your emerging identity as an expert with a constant awareness of who your work is for. When this succeeds, you establish yourself as an individual, recognizable to those who experience your work.

Alongside these two shifts runs Learning to impro vise . By now, you are taking responsibility for the successes and failures of your work, and you're responding to what life throws at you. You may be leading a surgical team, as I was. You may be developing your own research as a scientist, or setting up in business. You may be performing in public, writing a novel or heading up your department. Whatever your field, you'll be faced with the unexpected, and you'll have to improvise. When things go wrong, it's up to you to fix them. At the same time, as a Journeyman, you have freedom. You can develop new ideas, challenge existing methods, put your own stamp on the things you make or do. As we'll see, some of the most creative leaps come from serendipitous insights that nobody anticipated or planned. Improvisation is a hallmark of becoming expert.

03 Master

By this time you have become expert in the field you've spent so long studying. A few people go further, reimagining their field and taking it to a different place. In Changing direction , I examine what it means to reshape your field and take it in a new direction. Many of the experts in this book have done exactly that. One of these was John Wickham, a pivotal figure in the development of keyhole surgery.

In the final step, Passing it on , you are sharing your expertise with others and helping them grow. This requires another switch ‘from you to them', but this time ‘them' refers to people in your field: students, apprentices, and colleagues in your group or community of practice. Passing it on forces you to think about your own thinking. It makes you clarify what you do, distilling years of expertise into something you can share with others. Not all experts do this formally, establishing their own teaching practice or workshop. Not all experts do this at all.

This is when you take responsibility for supporting other people as they learn and for the errors they will inevitably make. You take the rap if things go wrong. You may ‘pass it on' in other ways too. You might write a book or a blog, or share your work through television, radio or the internet. Whatever the format, passing it on is a marker of having become expert, a recognition that you have something worth sharing.

Being a Master is more than just conveying what you know. It is a relationship of care. You are as much a mentor and a coach as a teacher. You are taking responsibility for people who come along behind you, and you're contributing to your field. Often you develop a sense of stewardship, a concern for the sustainability of the work you believe in so strongly. Many experts join boards or teaching faculties, supporting groups of learners as well as individuals. The work of becoming expert is never over, but the Master always runs out of time.

This path to becoming expert makes things sound simpler than they are. Often, experts don't recognize or acknowledge that they have become expert, especially as there is no final point of completion. It's difficult to know when you've arrived. Or you may be expert in some areas but not in others.

Experts themselves are often the last people to recognize that they are expert at all. They might feel an imposter, constantly wondering when they're going to be found out. They are astonished that others want to come and learn from them. They may not feel they have achieved ‘Master' status. But that doesn't mean they aren't expert. It just means that becoming an expert is different from having expertise. Often it takes someone else to recognize the distinction.

The journey from novice to expert is not linear. The stages are seldom as clear-cut as I've made them seem. The journey stops and starts and stutters. Often it feels like one step forward and two steps back. Becoming expert is about identity, about becoming a taxidermist, a tailor or a computer programmer; not just being able to do the things those people do.

This is a subtle but important distinction. It involves an ontological shift, a change in who you are as well as what you can do. This identity formation takes a long time and can be scary. Experiences along the way have profound effects: a serious error can forge a new resilience – or knock you back; extra responsibility can open up new horizons – or bring paralysing insecurity. All this builds into a cumulative experience that shapes what you become.

This book describes a path that runs from knowing nothing to passing on the wisdom of a lifetime. If you know it will take years to get there, you'll be less likely to give up after a few months if things aren't going well. There will be bumpy bits – long periods of boredom or frustration; bleak times when you don't seem to make any progress; points when you're tempted just to throw the whole thing over – and a map may help. Though a map won't keep you dry when it's raining, at least you're not lost.

You don't become an expert overnight. It takes a long time and a lot of effort. Without those, it won't happen. But how much time and how much effort? That's impossible to say, as it depends so much on each person. In the chapters that follow I will pull together the stories of people who have become experts, and try to make sense of their collective experience. Some of these stories are about the skills these experts had to develop, the way they learned to look and to do. Even more important are the shifts they made in their thinking and the self-awareness they gained along the way.

Being expert is hard to pin down. There's no clear moment when you ‘get there'. You're in a perpetual state of becoming, zooming ahead in some areas and lagging behind in others. That's one of the things that characterizes true experts. They're always dissatisfied with where they've got to, always aware they could do things better.

Experts know that they can never stay still. It's like being in a boat, rowing slowly against the current. If you're not moving forward, you start to drift back. You can be proud of the work you've done, but you can never say that you have become as good as you will ever be. You have to keep moving, putting in energy, or you stagnate.

学徒：积累、运用感官、空间与他人

熟练工：「重点不在于你」、找到自己的声音

大师：传承技艺

本书的核心就是这个「学艺模型」（apprenticeship model）。几个世纪以来，这个理论在欧洲广泛流传，在世界各地也有类似的理论。许多人认为该模型与中世纪工匠学艺的行会系统有关。尽管英国的许多学徒制度正在被社会、政治与工业化变革所淘汰，但该模型依然有助于我们的思考。在历史上，「学艺」是指学习一门手艺或行当，但对我而言，这个词也适用于各种专家 —— 从动物标本剥制师到教师，从水管工到飞行员。即使大多数人没有仔细思考过这个模型，也能凭直觉理解。最重要的是，该模型形象地表明了进步的理念。我会以这个模型作为本书的框架。

从传统上讲，学艺过程包含了三个阶段 —— 学徒、熟练工与大师。当然，现在的社会条件与中世纪的欧洲截然不同。学徒不再睡在师父的家里，也不再需要无偿工作多年，但是这种阶段划分为想要成为专家的人提供了指引。

1、学徒：你在开始学习时一无所知。你观察、模仿别人，学着去做师父工坊里的那些事情。你的师父要为你的工作和你犯的错误负责，而你工作取得的任何成绩也属于师父。

2、熟练工：你以独立专家的身份开始职业生涯。你离开了师父的工坊，周游全国。现在你要为自己的工作负责，必须面对犯错的后果。你会不断获得经验，磨炼并精进你的技能，发展你的个性。

3、大师：最后你建立了自己的工坊，开始教授他人。你把自己的知识和专长传递给了下一代。你尽可能地照顾那些向你学习的人；你对自己的专业领域有着更广泛的责任意识；有时你甚至会引领这个领域的新方向。

这三个阶段是理解技能学习的有效方法，但它们是描述性的，而不是解释性的。这些阶段阐明了过程中的节点，但不会告诉你如何到达这些节点，或怎样才能知道自己何时到达。这些阶段将学艺过程分成了不同的部分，并将这些部分视为静态的。它们衡量了可以衡量的东西，但许多重要的东西是无法衡量的。有些改变体现在「你是谁」上，而不仅体现在「你能做什么」上。这个过程可能从外表上是看不出来的。它很难量化，甚至难以觉察。

许多研究关注的是「专长」，将其限定在客观的属性与能力方面。在这些研究看来，专长与获得专长的人是分开的。所谓专长，就是能够制作燕尾榫的木工手艺，或者把球投入篮筐的球技。但我更感兴趣的是人的内部发生了什么，成为专家的过程意味着什么，成为一位被同行、公众和外界认可的专家又意味着什么。我感兴趣的不是一个人如何制作燕尾榫，而是学习制作燕尾榫的时候发生了什么。

描述性的结论很少能提供行之有效的诀窍。如果你想成为专家，它们不会告诉你应该做什么准备，或者应该朝哪个方向努力。它们也不会告诉你可能需要多长时间，或者在途中会遇到什么问题。所以我把「学徒－熟练工－大师」的模型分解成了更小的步骤，也就是成为专家的诀窍。这些步骤构成了本书的章节。在前文的图中，我描绘了这些步骤与「学徒－熟练工－大师」框架的对应关系。当然，这些步骤并不总是按顺序进行的，不同阶段之间常有重叠，但它们阐明了大致的方向。

学徒

在最开始，你要做的是学习。你进入了别人的世界，学习按照他们的方式做事，而他们会为你的行为负责。我把这一步称为「积累」。你关注的是自己 —— 你正在学习的知识和技能。你不可避免地会犯错，但你受到了保护，免受这些错误对于工作本身和你个人的影响。你成了这个实践社群的一员，这群人已经在做着你渴望学习的事情。这个社群通常会很支持你，不过你可能当时不会感觉到这一点。旁人不会期待，甚至不会允许你偏离既定的做事方式，尝试新鲜事物。你的任务是顺应传统，而不是创新。你的工作是重复、无聊、费力地完成微不足道的任务，甚至在你不理解的情况下也不得不做一些事情。

下一步是「运用感官」。这与「积累」的成果有关：你对自己学习的事情逐渐产生了理解。你开始熟悉这个你正在融入的世界了。你了解了它的运作方式。你会用自己的感官和思维、双手和身体，来感受自己所做的工作。无论你要成为一名石匠还是医生，无论你是在夜校学习制作帽子、成年后才初学双簧管，还是正在学习成为一名律师、电影制作人、会计或其他职业者，都会经历这一阶段。

最后一步是「空间与他人」，这与系统性地处理工作对象、使用工具有关。这就好比厨师所说的「准备工作」（miseen place）。在这个过程中，你会对工作中的人（你的同事、患者、顾客或客户）产生一种敏锐的感知。你会学习如何进入他人的个人空间，并在其中工作。

现在你已经准备好离开学徒阶段了。随之而来的是犯错和纠正。你有时会犯错，但到目前为止，你还是一个新手，会得到一些保护。你犯错误，是大家预料之中的事。你周围的环境已得到了妥善的安排。这样你、你的同事和工作场所就受到了保护，免受你错误的影响。你会从那些无关紧要、可以被替代的事情做起。有人会告诉你何时偏离了正轨，以及如何纠正错误。你处在一个安全的空间里。但是在下一阶段，这种情况就开始发生改变了。

熟练工

现在，你已经独立了 —— 为自己的工作及其影响负责。从学徒到熟练工的转变包括两个关键的变化。我将第一个变化称为「重点不在于你」，这句话是从与我合作过的魔术师那里借用来的。这种转变需要你彻底改变关注的焦点，把注意力从自己身上移开。专业工作是为别人做事。在某个地方，有一名受众 —— 你所做的事情会影响这个人，不过你并非总能直接看见他。受众可能近在咫尺，比如音乐会、足球赛或戏剧的观众。在这种情况下，专家与受众同处一个空间与时间，工作的完成与接受是同步的。但是在其他领域，受众并不总是与你在一起，工作的完成与接受是不同步的。陶艺师在工作室里制作花瓶时，可能没有人在一旁观看，但他们仍然希望自己的作品被人看到，无论是在商店、展览还是展示会上。虽然制作花瓶的过程不被人看见，但总是有受众的，即使这些受众仅存在于理论上、远方或者完全未知的地方。

无论你是艺术家、科学家、医生还是机械师，这一阶段都要求你把注意力从自己身上移开。这就是「从你到他们」的转变。「他们」是指接受你工作的人 —— 你的观众、患者或顾客。这是一种至关重要的转变，不过在你成为专家的过程中，这种转变并不会发生在固定的时间点上。有时根本不会发生。可能你在技术上很出色，但依然关注自己，罔顾或破坏了你工作的核心。在我的职业生涯中，偶尔会遇到不守规矩的外科医生做一些不必要的手术，或者未经患者同意就进行实验，他们的技术往往很高超，但他们歪曲了工作的目的。他们认为工作主要是为了自己，而不是患者。

第二个变化是「找到自己的声音」。这句话是我从爵士乐领域里学来的。爵士音乐家会创造个性化的标志。作为一个表演者，到了某种程度，你就不再是他人机器里的一颗齿轮了，而是凭借自己的本事，成为专业工作中的一个创造者。当你形成自己的风格时，你就发展了自己的个性。现在，你真正塑造着自己的工作方式，并为之赋予你的特色。你要为做自己、建立自己的身份认同承担责任。这需要信心和自我信念。

这是一个微妙的过程，因为这个过程需要与「重点不在于你」的转变同时发生，这样就不会让你变得傲慢或以自我为中心。

你不仅要找到作为专家的新身份，还要时刻意识到自己工作是为了谁，在这两种之间找到平衡。当你成功做到这一点时，在那些接受你工作的人眼中，你就成了一个独立的、鲜明的形象。

在这两种转变的同时，你还要学会随机应变。此时，你要为工作的成败负责，要处理你所面临的境况。你可能会像我过去那样，领导一个外科团队。你可能是一个在自己领域里耕耘的科学家，或者是创业的商人。你可能会写小说、在公众面前表演，或者领导自己的部门。无论你在什么行业，你都会面临意想不到的事情，而你将不得不随机应变。当事情出错的时候，需要你来处理它们。与此同时，作为一名熟练工，你拥有一些自由。你可以发展新的理念，挑战现有的方法，在你所做的事情上留下自己的印记。我们将会看到，有些最有创意的飞跃源于偶然的灵感，没有人能意料到或预先做出计划。随机应变是成为专家的标志。

大师

此时，你已经在自己耕耘已久的领域里成了专家。有些人走得更远，重塑了自己的领域，引领它进入了不同的境界。在第 10 章「改变方向」里，我会探讨重塑自己的领域，将其带入新方向意味着什么。本书中的许多专家正是做了这样的事情。其中一人就是约翰·威克姆（John Wickham），他是推动锁孔手术发展的关键人物。

在最后一步 ——「传承技艺」中，你会与别人分享自己的专长，帮助他们成长。这需要你在关注点上再次做出「从你到他们」的转变，但这一次，「他们」指的是你领域内的人：学生、学徒以及你所在的实践团体或社群里的同事。「传承技艺」会迫使你思考自己的思维方式 —— 弄清自己所做的事情，把自己积累多年的专长提炼成可以分享的东西。并非所有的专家都会专门这样做，比如开班授课或举办研讨会。有些专家根本不会做这些事。

他人在学习的时候，必然会犯错。就在这个时候，你要承担起支持他们的责任。如果出了差错，你就得承担责任。你也可以通过其他方式「传承技艺」。你可以写书，或者通过电视、广播或互联网分享自己的工作。无论以哪种形式，「传承技艺」是成为专家的标志，是对你拥有值得分享的东西的认可。

成为「大师」不仅需要你把自己所知的东西传承下去。这是一种关心他人的关系。你不仅是一名教师，也是导师和教练。你要为跟随你的人负责，要为自己的领域做贡献。你通常会产生一种责任意识，关心你所坚信的事业的持续发展。许多专家会加入一些委员会、成为教师，支持学习者和学习团体。成为专家的过程永远不会结束，但大师的时间总是有限的。

这条成为专家的道路，会让事情听起来比实际上简单。专家往往不知道或不承认他们已经成了专家，尤其是因为这条道路没有终点。你很难知道自己何时成为专家。你可能在某些领域是专家，但在另一些领域则不是。

专家往往是最后一个认识到自己是专家的人。他们可能会觉得自己名不副实，不断地担心自己的真面目什么时候会被揭穿。其他人想要来向他们学习会让他们感到很惊讶。他们可能不会觉得自己已经取得了「大师」的地位，但这不意味着他们不是专家。这只是意味着成为专家与拥有专长是不同的。通常只有其他人才能看清这两种之间的区别。

从新手到专家的过程不是一条平坦的直线。这些阶段的划分也很少像我说的那样清晰。这趟旅程是走走停停、断断续续的，经常让人觉得好像前进了一步，又后退了两步。成为专家在于身份认同，在于成为一名标本剥制师、裁缝或电脑程序员，而不仅仅是能够做那些人做的事情。

这是一个微妙而重要的区别，涉及一种本体的转变 —— 一种「你是谁」以及「你能做什么」的转变。这种身份认同的形成需要很长时间，而且可能很可怕。一路走来的经历有着深远的影响；一个严重的错误可能造就新的抗逆力，也可能让你一蹶不振；额外的责任可能打开新的视野，也可能带来让人无能为力的不安全感。所有这一切汇集成经验，塑造了你所成为的人。

本书描绘了一条道路：从一无所知到传承一生的智慧。如果你知道这条路需要多年才能走完，那么当事情进展不顺时，你就不太可能在几个月后就放弃了。路上会有坎坷 —— 漫长的无聊与沮丧，似乎毫无进展的暗淡时光，有时还想把一切抛到一边。这幅地图也许能帮你。虽然这幅地图不能在下雨时让你保持干爽，但你至少不会迷路。

你不会在一夜之间成为专家。这需要花费很长时间，付出很多努力。若非如此，这一切就不会发生。但是，到底需要多长时间、多大努力？很难说，因为这在很大程度上取决于每个人的特点。在接下来的章节里，我会讲述那些已经成为专家的人的故事，并试图从中总结他们共同的经验。其中一些故事，与这些专家必须发展的技能有关，与他们学到的观察和做事方式有关。更重要的是他们在一路上产生和获得的思维方式，以及自我意识的转变。

成为专家的过程是很难明确界定的。没有明确的「到达终点」的时刻。你永远处在「成为」的状态中。你可能在某些领域高歌猛进，而在另一些领域则不尽如人意。这是真正专家的特点。他们总是对自己的现状不满，总是意识到自己能做得更好。专家知道他们不会永远原地踏步。这就像逆水行舟，不进则退。你可以为自己的工作感到自豪，但你永远不能说你已经达到了巅峰。你必须继续前进，付出精力，否则就会停滞不前。

### 1.5 本书的结构

How this book is structured

This book is not about how to do the things experts do. That may be fascinating, but it's not my aim; I don't want to become a taxidermist, and I doubt you do either. Nor is it about expertise in abstract academic terms, though it does draw on what others have written.

Instead I lay down a challenge to move beyond the discipline-based thinking that keeps plumbers, neuroscientists, potters, magicians and heart surgeons in separate compartments. I highlight similarities and differences between experts, and I map a path from raw novice to wise mentor.

This book is about real people.

One of the strands running through the chapters that follow is my insider's perspective. That gives me access to things other people can't or won't say. I've drawn on my own experiences: the mistakes I've made, the thoughts I've had, and the ideas I've developed over the years. In my case, many of these are medical. That's inevitable, because I'm a doctor. My emphasis on clinical experiences is not because the world of medicine is unusually expert, but because that happens to be my story. If you were writing it, the central thread would be different. In that case you'd be drawing on other examples, making other connections. But the stages and themes would be similar.

In my professional career, I've changed direction several times and I'm still doing that now. I've been a surgeon, a family doctor, an academic and a university teacher, and in those areas I've become proficient. I have other interests too. As an amateur musician I'm still at the shallow end – nowhere near being an expert. And as a harpsichord-maker and a light-aircraft pilot I've had an initial taste, but never progressed beyond being a beginner. All of us do different things with our lives, and we're always at different staging posts along the path towards becoming expert. I've simply drawn on the parallels that are closest to hand for me, so I can draw comparisons.

At various points in the story, however, I'll bring in other strands and other experts. One of these is Joshua Byrne, a bespoke tailor I've been working with for over a decade. At first glance, Joshua's world and mine could hardly be further apart. After all, medicine is a science and tailoring is a craft – or so it seems. Yet our experiences have been surprisingly similar. We've been through the same stages, struggled with similar challenges. By comparing our experiences, our difficulties, and our ways of looking at the world, I will trace the shape of the path from Apprentice to Master.

I'll also bring in more people at the top of their game. I've already introduced Derek the taxidermist. Over the years I've had the privilege of meeting many others. Some are colleagues in medicine and science. Some are experts in the visual and performing arts. And there are pilots, magicians and craftspeople, too. I've watched them in their studios, workshops and laboratories, and I've spent hours talking to them. Those insights form the backbone of my research.

Though my own career has been medical, I'm not practising as a doctor now. If I'm expert in anything, it's education. When I work with students and trainee surgeons I see them struggling with the steps I've outlined. I see them coping with boring repetitive work, developing skill in their hands and bodies, dealing with error, working with people, and going on to teach. I've also read what others have written about expertise, and tried to understand their theories and their ideas.

As you read this book another strand will emerge – your own. Everyone has their own experience of becoming expert, to a greater or lesser degree. Whether you're dedicating your life to a single focused aim or simply trying to get better at something you enjoy, the urge to become expert lies in each of us. It is difficult but not impossible. It's like running a marathon: anyone can do it if they train for long enough and persevere. Few of us will become world champions, but we can all try.

本书讲的不是如何做那些专家做的事情。那个话题可能很有意思，但不是我的目标；我不想成为一名标本剥制师，我猜那也不是你的目标。本书讲的也不是作为抽象术语的「专长」，但我确实借鉴了许多他人的著作。

相反，我提出了一项挑战，要超越那种把水管工、神经科学家、陶艺师、魔术师和心外科医生划分为不同领域的、以学科为基础的思维方式。我强调了专家之间的相似点和不同点，并描绘了一条从稚嫩新手到明智导师的道路。

这本书讲的是真正的人。

接下来的章节中有一条主线，也就是我个人的视角。这样我就能讨论他人不能或不愿说的事情。我总结了亲身经历：我犯的错误、我的想法，以及我多年来形成的观念。在我的例子里，很多这些东西都与医学有关。这是不可避免的，因为我是医生。我强调临床工作的经历，并不是因为医学领域的专业性异乎寻常，而是因为这恰好是我的故事。如果你来写这本书，主线可能就大不相同了。在这种情况下，你就会借鉴其他的例子，阐述其他的相关论据。但是，这些阶段和主题是相似的。

在我的职业生涯里，我改变过几次方向，我现在依然在这样做。我做过外科医生、家庭医生、学者和大学教师，我在这些领域都很得心应手。我也有其他兴趣。作为一名业余的音乐家，我的水平还很一般 —— 比专家差远了。我对制作羽管键琴和开轻型飞机感兴趣，但从没有超越初学者的水平。我们每个人在生活中都做着不同的事情，在成为专家的路上，我们总是处在不同的阶段。我只是描绘了最贴近我生活的路线，以便进行比较。

不过，在故事的不同时刻，我会引入其他线索、其他专家的例子。约书亚·伯恩（Joshua Byrne）就是其中之一，他是一位与我合作了十余年的定制裁缝。乍一看，约书亚和我的世界相去甚远。毕竟，医学是一门科学，而裁缝是一门手艺 —— 或者看上去如此。然而，我们的经历却惊人地相似。我们经历了相同的阶段，面临过相似的挑战。通过比较我们的经历、困境，以及我们看待世界的方式，我会描绘出从学徒到大师的道路。

我也会介绍更多在各自领域内拔尖的人。我已经介绍了标本剥制师德里克。这些年来，我还有幸认识了许多这样的人。有些人是医学和科学领域的同事，有些人是视觉与表演艺术方面的专家，还有飞行员、魔术师、工匠。我在他们的工作室、工坊和实验室里观察过他们，并与他们交谈了好多个小时。这些见解构成了我研究的支柱。

虽然我从事的是医学，但我现在并非执业医生。如果说我是什么方面的专家，那就是教育。在与学生和实习外科医生一起工作时，我发现他们会在我说的那些步骤上遇到困难。我看到他们要处理无聊的重复性工作、发展双手与身体上的技能、纠正错误、与他人一起工作，然后继续走上教学岗位。我也读过其他人写的关于「专长」的文献，试图理解他们的理论和理念。

在你阅读本书的时候，另一条主线会浮现出来 —— 你的主线。每个人或多或少都有成为专家的经历。无论你是一生都投身于一个目标，还是只想在自己喜欢的事情上做得更好，成为专家的渴望存在于我们每个人的身上。成为专家很难，但并非不可能。这就像跑马拉松一样：只要训练时间够长，持之以恒，每个人都能做到。我们中很少有人能成为世界冠军，但我们都可以尝试。

### 1.6 专家面临的威胁

Experts under threat

So why is becoming expert important? In the book's final chapter I'll try to explain. For centuries, the apprenticeship system expected people to go through the lengthy process that leads in the end to mastery. Though becoming expert brings rewards, these rewards don't come instantly. There are no shortcuts, and immediate gratification is not on offer. This is increasingly at odds with our social world and its intolerance of doing things slowly. People are impatient, and they want to see results. They don't want to spend years in someone else's workshop before becoming independent.

In some ways, the work of individual experts is highly prized, especially in a world of uniformity and mass production. At the same time, experts as a group are being devalued and their skills dismissed. This is partly because the end result – a suit, a vase, a successful operation – conceals the work that has gone into it. The greater the expertise, the less you notice it. So it's often easy to imagine that you or anyone else could do the same.

But there's also a devaluing of expertise in society. Experts are seen as elite, unnecessary and dispensable, because information that was once their exclusive province can now be accessed at the click of a mouse. But this is a dangerous misconception. Information is not wisdom. And wisdom is what experts provide.

We have always needed experts, and I believe we always will. Partly that's because of what they can do for us: the services they provide, and the objects and experiences they create. But just as importantly, they give us inspiration. They show us what we can do if we really want to. At the end of this book I'll return to why experts are essential to us all and address questions I often hear, such as: Why should we seek to become expert in some areas of our life? Why are experts under threat? And what can we do about it?

I started this book with Derek the taxidermist posing his clouded leopard. But for now we'll leave Derek and go back several decades, to a hospital on the outskirts of Johannesburg in South Africa. I'm in the operating theatre with Simon, who has been disembowelled.

为什么成为专家很重要？我会在本书的最后一章尝试解释这个问题。几个世纪以来，学徒制要求人们经历漫长的过程，最终掌握一门技艺。虽然成为专家会带来回报，但回报不是立竿见影的。这个过程没有捷径，也没有即时的满足。这一点与我们的社会越来越格格不入，社会不再能容忍慢吞吞地做事了。

大家已经没有耐心了，他们想看到结果。他们不希望在独立工作之前，还得在别人的工坊里待上好多年。

在某些方面，专家个体的工作受到了高度重视，尤其是在这个步调一致、大规模生产的世界里。与此同时，专家群体正在贬值，他们的技能正在遭到遗弃。这在一定程度上是因为最终结果（一套西装、一个花瓶或一次成功的手术）隐藏了专家们为之付出的心血。其中蕴含的专业技能越多，你就越难以注意到。所以大家很容易以为自己或任何人都能做到同样的事情。

但是社会对于专长的评价也越来越低。专家被视为可有可无的精英，因为曾经专属于他们的信息，现在点点鼠标就唾手可得。然而这是一种危险的误解。信息不是智慧。智慧才是专家提供的东西。

我们一直都需要专家，我相信我们以后也是如此。这在一定程度上是因为他们能为我们做的事情：他们提供的服务，以及他们创造的事物和体验。但同样重要的是，他们鼓舞了我们。

他们告诉了我们，如果我们真心想做，就能够做到什么。在本书的最后，我会回到「为什么专家对我们所有人都很重要」的问题上，并回答我常常听到的问题，例如：我们为什么要成为生活某些领域的专家？为什么专家受到了威胁？我们能对此做些什么？

在本书开篇处，我写到了标本剥制师德里克给他的云豹标本摆的造型。但现在，我们要离开德里克，回到几十年前，去南非约翰内斯堡郊外的一所医院。我现在来到了西蒙的手术室里，他正在被开膛破肚。
