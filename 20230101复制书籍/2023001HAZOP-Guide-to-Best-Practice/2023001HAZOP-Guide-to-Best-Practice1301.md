However, it can be argued that creativity is better encouraged by the guideword-first approach, particularly for the later guidewords such as "part of,""as well as," and "other than." The reason for this is that while appropriate guidewords are easily selected, it is a greater challenge to get a fully comprehensive and imaginative coverage of the parameters. If the parameter-first approach is used, there is a tendency to list the parameters at the start of the analysis and, when the original list is exhausted, to move on to the next section without a final search for any more parameters. This is not good practice.
Consequently, the parameter-first approach may provide conve- nience, but it demands a greater understanding and application by the team leader and the team members if the best results are to be obtained. APPENDIX 2
The Use of Checklists Within HAZOP Study
The use of checklists is contrary to the principles of the HAZOP study method but for an experienced leader, a carefully constructed checklist for a commonly encountered unit can be a helpful way of ensuring that less common deviations are fully considered. With less experience, however, there is a danger that these become a substitute for the creative thinking and analysis from first principles that are essential characteristics of a good HAZOP study.
The examples given here illustrate two ways in which checklists may be used. Table A2.1 lists some aspects which might be considered under the guideword "other (other than)." Table A2.2 gives checklists for vessels and for vents/drains. Neither is comprehensive, nor will all the items in the list need consideration in every analysis. Thus, it is recommended that if lists are used at all they are the responsibility of the team leader who brings out items from the list which might apply in the circumstances of the study. Furthermore, it is important that such lists are customized and expanded to ensure relevance to each industry and application. 100

An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a
Continuous Operation
The model used for this illustration of the HAZOP study is of an off- shore wellhead gas platform linked to a central process facility (CPF) by a 15 km subsea pipeline. There is no chemistry but it is essential the team understands both the physics and physical chemistry of the process.
Gas is trapped in a loose sandstone formation 2000 m below the sea bed. It is in hydrostatic equilibrium, trapped by an impervious rock over and around the sandstone rock but in water contact at the bottom. The gas exists as a dense phase, mostly methane, saturated with water vapor at 80°C and 200 bar(20 MPa). The gas flows to the surface in a production tubing of 15 cm diameter, made up from a number of threaded sections, and the pressure falls due to both fric- tional losses and the reduced gas static head; the flowing pressure at the top of the well is about 125 bar. The production tubing is sur- rounded by a number of threading casings of increasing diameter which are used in the drilling program, the number and size of cas- ings is a function of the local geology. The effective pressure contain- ing capacity of each casing is a function of the strength of the rocks and the cement bond between the rock and tubing. If there is a leak of gas into the annulus between each casing. there is the potential for collapse of the inner casing due to pressure reversal, so it is essential to ensure a pressure gradient "in to out" and, if leakage occurs through the threaded sections of casing, it must be depressurized. Likewise, in the upper sections of the casing, multiple path leakage could lead to a fracture of the cement. There is one major barrier (flap-type valve) set in the production tubing 250 m below the sea bed. This is called the sub-surface safety valve (SSSV-sometimes called a down hole safety valve (DHSV)) and is held open by a hydraulic signal. Loss of the signal causes valve closure, and the valve is difficult to open under high pressure differential. 102 Appendix 3: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Continuous Operation
The casings are terminated on a "wellhead"(Figure A3.1, pages
108-109) which is bolted to the “Christmas tree.”Within the tree is
a master valve (MV) and, at an angle to the flow, a wing valve
(WV); both are held open by a hydraulic signal. The emergency roles
of each valve vary-the SSSV is protection against a main process
event or failure of the tree. the WV is the main process valve. and
the MV is used during downwell operations. Depending
upon the level of emergency, the WV closes first, then the MV, and
finally the SSSV. There are five wells in total in the field feeding the
CPF. The flow of gas is controlled by a metal-to-metal seated manu-
ally operated valve called a choke. This is usually left in a fixed
position and only adjusted occasionally. As the pressure drops across
the choke, the temperature falls and two phases (condensate and
gas) are produced. If the pressure drop is from 200 bar to less than
about 50 bar. the temperature can fall below 0°C and ice and/or
hydrocarbon hydrate solid can be formed which is controlled by
injection of methanol. There is every potential for temperatures as
low as -50°C during the initial start-up of the process when the gas
column in the production tubing loses its heat to the rocks surround-
ing the well and the initial temperature of the flowing gas could be
as low as 15/20°C.
The two phases flow into a collection manifold through a safety
shut-off valve (ESDV2) into the subsea pipeline, about 30 m below sea
level, linking the wellhead platform to the CPF, 25 m above sea level.
The pipeline is rated for the maximum closed wellhead pressure (about
180 bar). There is some phase separation at low flow rates but for the
most part transport is in mist or annular flow. The gas flows onto the
CPF, 55 m above the sea bed, through a second safety shut-off valve
(ESDV3) at the edge of the platform and then a process shutdown
valve before entering a two-phase separator (Figure A3.2, pages
110-111)with a design pressure of 120 bar. Gas and liquid phases are
metered separately, and the two phases then pass through a third
safety shut-off valve (ESDV6) into a main subsea pipeline connecting
the CPF to a shore terminal where it is processed. The data from the
two flows, gas and liquid is used for reservoir performance monitoring
and also apportioning products at the onshore terminal to each
supplier. The main subsea pipeline has a pressure rating equal to the
separator. A pig launcher can be fitted for pipeline monitoring
(Figure A3.3, pages 112-113). Appendix 3： An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Continuous Operation 103
As the reservoir ages, the reservoir pressure falls, the flow rates decrease, and the water tends to increase. Ultimately, the reservoir tends to produce sand due to high-level pressure differentials and this is very abrasive.
Water associated with the gas is very saline and can be corrosive, so corrosion inhibitors are injected with the methanol used for hydrate suppression. The infield pipeline (and main pipeline)is protected from corrosion from seawater by sacrificial anodes, likewise the wellhead and CPF structures. There is therefore a potential electrochemical link- age between the three central elements. The pipe work is protected from corrosion internally by the corrosion inhibitor in the methanol injected for hydrate suppression.
The gas produces 1 m3 of liquids per 20,000 standard m3 gas during the separation process. The separator is designed for some"slugging" capacity and has some offline washing facility to remove sand. The liquid phase is level controlled and the gas phase is pressure controlled into the pipeline. The separator is fitted with high level alarms and shutdowns which close a shutdown valve inlet to the separation. The separator is protected against overpressure by a full-flow relief valve, discharging to a vent, sized for the maximum steady-state well flows. There are also two levels of pressure protection which first close the process shutdown valve and finally the WV.
There are other technical issues which are not discussed in this illus- tration as they do not serve to illustrate the study technique. These will need to be addressed in a real study.
A3.1 METHANOL INJECTION
Methanol is used as a hydrate suppressant and is pumped by a positive displacement pump to injection pressure at the shore terminal. Corrosion inhibitor is mixed with methanol at the terminal and there is an emergency shut-off valve in the feed line at the wellhead platform (ESDV1). The main pump is fitted with a recycle pressure relief valve set at 240 bar. Each well is dosed continuously for 1 week with corro- sion inhibitor. The changeover is carried out manually during the weekly inspection giving a 5-week cycle. The flow is controlled onshore to prevent hydrate formation in the pipeline. 104 Appendix 3: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Continuous Operation A3.2 GENERAL PROCESS DATA
In this model, the gas flow is taken as 105 sm3/h and the pipeline is
12 in. (30 cm) diameter. The closed-in system pressure is 180 bar for
which all piping on the wellhead platform and the subsea piping is
designed. The CPF is designed for a pressure of 120 bar downstream
of the process shutdown valve (ESDV3).
All process piping is designed for -30C at the appropriate pres-
sure, and the separator is designed for -40°C as it will contain liquid
hydrocarbon. During process blowdown, the gas temperatures can fall
to -40°C (or lower). Slugs and liquid equivalent to three riser lengths
can be produced on increasing flow.
There is a fire and gas detection system which isolates the valves
into and out of the CPF and depressure the process-level two. Such
an event on this wellhead platform involves closure of the export valve
and the WV plus MV but no depressuring. Loss of pressure in the
manifold on the wellhead platform results in closure of the SSSV.
A3.3 THE ISSUES
The inflow of gas is generally limited by the productivity index (PI) of
the well. It self-limits at high demands and probably produces sand.
Once the well is flowing, it must be managed to avoid sand (and water)
production by fixing the choke position. Sand production can be
detected by sand probes, and excessive sand production leads to erosion
of the choke and piping and eventually settles out in the main pipeline.
Corrosion is detected by a probe. More corrosion inhibitor is injected.
The SSSV is self-closing and cannot be opened with a pressure dif-
ferential of more than a few hundred psi. SSSVs are available with
compensating features and there are thousands of wells in UKCS. The
MV and WV can be opened with a pressure differential and the choke
operates with a pressure differential. The choke is not a shut-off valve
and tends to wear and leak with time due to sand erosion.
Hydrates-a loose formation of hydrocarbon and liquid water-form
above about 600 psi (4 MPa) and temperatures of about 15°C; this is con-
trolled by methanol. Expansion of gas can produce both a water and
hydrocarbon liquid phase. Temperatures as low as -50°C are possible
with throttling but are composition and pressure/temperature dependent. Appendix 3: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Continuous Operation
105
When the infield pipeline is isolated, it slowly pressures due to choke valve leakage and could reach the shut-in well pressure. It is possible to open the shutdown valves with this pressure differential but valve seat damage may result.
The steady-state issues are generally sand and erosion; the dynamic, start-up, and shutdown issues are hydrants and low-temperature for- mation. The transient states involve the potential to move from wavy flow to mist flow with slug potential, which may be exacerbated by sea bed contours. The operating pressures are high and close to the piping design pressure limits.
There are effectively six blocks for this HAZOP study:
1)methanol pumps-onshore
not included
2)wellhead platform
Figure A3.1
3)subsea infield line
Figures A3.1 and A3.2
4)production platform and vent system

5)main pipeline to the shore

6)onshore terminal
not included
Block six-the onshore terminal has a slug catcher and gas processing equipment as well as the methanol pumps. These are out of the direct scope of this study, but it is very likely that this study will contain some actions for the hand over of information to the onshore HAZOP team.
A3.4 METHODOLOGY
There are four distinct operations:
1. start-up-low-pressure downstream;
2. start-up -system pressurized;
3. shutdown and blowdown;
4. process transient.
There is little point in analyzing transients when the process cannot be started, so the logical approach is to analyze the start-up first (Tables A3.1 and A3.2, pages 114-120). Experience shows that many of the problems associated with the continuous processes occur during the dynamic phases of upset, start-up, and shutdown. The first part of 106
Appendix 3: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Continuous Operation
the study illustrates this point and then in the second part, number 5 onward, moves on to the steady-state part of the study. It will be noted that the issues are quite different. It can be assumed that methanol is charged up to ESDV1, the process is air freed, and liquids are dis- placed so far as is possible prior to start-up.

The design intent is to flow five gas wells at the combined rate of 105 sm3/h(85 mmscfd)of gas from the wellhead platform, with as low sand content as practicable, into a production separator on the CPF.
The team has the following available:
a general description of the wellhead installation and the CPF;
a selection of P&IDs;
the "cause and effects" drawings for the shutdown system
(Tables A3.3 and A3.4, page 121);
the operating intent from which the detailed operations are written.
The outline operating intent is as follows:
open SSSV using methanol to form a pressure balance;
open MV and WV the choke valve and thereby pressure up the infield pipeline monitoring for evidence of chokes/hydrates;
slowly pressure the separator and then also the main pipeline to the shore;
each well is brought online in sequence.
The shutdown is on three levels.
Level one-process upset
Close an appropriate shutdown valve to arrest the cause of this event. Appendix 3: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Continuous Operation 107
Level two-major event
In general, this means a detected fire or detected gas leakage and
closes all valves around the process and blowdown all vessels-pipe-
lines remain pressurized.
Level three-potential for major escalation
The SSSV on the wellhead platform can be closed by a manual sig-
nal from the control center on the central platform.
The riser ESD valves on the wellhead platform are closed by a
manual signal from the control center on the central platform.
The riser ESD valves on the central platform are closed by fire or
high-level gas detection local to the valve or by a manual signal from
the control center.
Failure mode
All valves are controlled by hydraulic power (not air)and all fail
closed except for the blowdown valve ESDV7 which fails open.

A4.1 INTRODUCTION
This example illustrates the following aspects of a HAZOP study:
an overall description of the plant and process;
the selection of the stages of the process for study;
a list of the documentation available to the team;
the relevant P&ID:
the team membership;
for one stage:
the detailed description and the design intention;
a list of the parameters and guidewords used;
a part of the HAZOP study report, illustrating some of the devia-
tions with consequences, safeguards, and actions.
The example has been fabricated, although it is intended to resem- ble a real operation. For simplicity, the main reactants are simply labeled A and B.
A4.2 THE COMPANY, SITE, PLANT, AND PROCESS
The company is a long-established general chemical manufacturing company, employing over 2000 people at several sites in the UK. It has a good safety record and routinely uses HAZOP study for new plant, new processes, and major modifications. A central safety group oversees this activity and provides trained leaders for all process hazard studies on new plant or processes. The six-stage process hazard study system is used, with HAZOP study as the usual method used at stage three.
The site concerned with this process is on the outskirts of an indus- trial city and employs 350 people. It lies between a river and a major road and, on one side, is close to an old housing estate. There are a number of continuous processes and several general-purpose batch 124
Appendix 4: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Batch Operation
units on-site. The operation to be examined is for a new process in one of the batch units which will be adapted to the needs of this process. Laboratory work has been done to determine the batch size and conditions. Reaction hazard investigations have been carried out to identify the reaction hazards and to define a basis for safety.
The essential elements of the process are as follows. The sodium salt of an organic reactant, A, is formed by adding caustic soda solu- tion to A in a large reaction vessel. The process is mildly exothermic; a slight excess of caustic is used to maintain the pH around 11. The salt is then reacted with a second organic material, B, added at a controlled rate from a measure vessel. This reaction is very exothermic, and cool- ing is required. To obtain a high-quality product, the reaction needs to be carried out at between 55-60°C.
The section of the batch plant to be used for the reaction stage con- sists of two measure vessels at level two that will be used for the caus- tic soda solution and for reactant B. The required amounts are taken from drums on weigh scales, using vacuum. The feed to the reactor at level one is by gravity. Component A is pumped from drums directly into the reactor followed by a line flush with water. After the reaction is complete, as confirmed by analysis of a sample, the products are pumped to another vessel for further processing.
Component A is a solid, mp 30°C, flash point 45°C, with a long- term exposure limit (LTEL) of 10 ppm. Component B is a liquid, mp 5°C, bp 122°C, flash point 10°C, with a LTEL of 2 ppm and it causes chemical burns on skin contact. The solution of A in caustic soda and the product solution after reaction of B are all single-phase systems.
A4.3 THE PROCESS STAGES SELECTED FOR HAZOP STUDY

The basis for not selecting some stages is that they are simple,
familiar steps of low hazard potential, with little chance of incorrect
execution or omission by the operators.
During the HAZOP study, the team is expected to consider all
potential SHE hazards as well as operability problems.

A4.4.2 Plant Conditions and Step Description
As a consequence of the previous steps, the state of the plant at the start of this step is that the reaction vessel, F3, contains 425 kg of component A, 100 L of water, and 250 kg of 30% caustic. Component A has been converted to the sodium salt and sufficient excess caustic is present to raise the pH to 11. The stirrer is running and the mixture is controlled at 55-60°C, using hot water to the vessel jacket. The vessel is open to the scrubber through a condenser, set to return any condensed liquids to F3. Measure vessel F2 contains 375 kg of component B that is to be run down to F3 over a period of about 3 hour at 2 kg min. The flow rate is controlled by the orifice plate, OP1. Both F2 and F3 are operated at atmospheric pressure under nitrogen to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere. The continuous feed of nitrogen into each vessel is vented through the scrubber. The scrubber is operated to reduce the levels of vapor A and B to below their LTEL values to permit safe discharge at a high level.
The basis for safety was developed from work initiated in HS 2. It requires:
The rate of heat evolution from the amount of B present in the reac-
tor does not exceed the cooling capacity of the reactor. For this to
be achieved, all the following conditions must be maintained:
-the rate of addition of B is controlled at 2 kg min-I;
there is continuous stirring to avoid accumulation of B;
- the temperature is kept above 40°C to minimize accumulation of B; Appendix 4: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Batch Operation 129
If runaway reaction does occur, the reaction vessel is protected by
the rupture of the bursting disc which relieves to a dump tank from
which the resulting vent is acceptable at the expected frequency.
From the earlier hazard reviews, the worst case event is identified as a runaway reaction which is not fully relieved by the bursting disc. In this circumstance, it is estimated that the reactor design pressure could be exceeded by a factor of 1.5. Reactor rupture is possible but is of low probability. The consequences of vessel rupture would be the possibility of operator fatality and severe local contamination which, if an aerosol cloud forms. could be blown off-site. The worst effect of this is if the wind direction was toward the local housing estate. The operation of the bursting disc is crucial to avoidance of this event, and it has been sized on the basis of small-scale experiments providing data for use with the DIERS design rules.
As the previous steps have been subjected to HAZOP study, it is assumed that there is negligible chance that they are not as described unless new causes are found.
Step nine is started by opening valve AV203, all other conditions having been set previously. The operator initiates the step from a control panel through the computer control system. Apart from occa- sional checks during the 3 hour addition, the operator relies on the alarms to indicate any deviation from the set conditions. Alarms are set to indicate stirrer motor failure, and low and high temperatures of 50°C and 65°C, respectively. If the temperature reaches 70°C, the valve Av203 is automatically tripped to close. Step 10 (working out for 20 min)follows on directly from step nine with no change in the system or the settings. At 3y hour from the start of the reaction stage the computer closes AV203, puts the system to hold and awaits an operator input.

The team leader has prepared preselected combinations of para- meters and guidewords that give meaningful deviations, as shown in Table A4.2 (page 138). Team members are given opportunities to extend this list. Only those combinations generating a significant discussion are recorded in the HAZOP tables as no realistic mean- ings or likely causes were found for some. It was found that some of the later combinations had been adequately examined under earlier pairings-for example, "part of composition"was mostly dealt with by "more/less quantity. Some additional deviations came up during the analysis.
The following "parameters" are also considered under the guide- word "other (other than)":
services (including failure modes of valves);
. maintenance;
safety;
process interruption/hold/recovery;
drainage;
trips;
corrosion;
ignition sources (e.g., static electricity).
Action in emergencies-for example, fire, explosion, and toxic leak-is considered for the whole process at the completion of the HAZOP study of all the individual stages.

Meeting date: 28/02/15; Revision: 0. Appendix 4: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Batch Operation 131 A4.5.1 Step Description
A measured quantity of component B is added by gravity feed from F2 to the prepared mixture in F3 at 55-60°C. The step is initiated by the operator using the computer control system and the addition is started by opening valve AV203, all other valves being preset. The addition takes about 3 hours followed by a short workout period. The total time for these steps is 3% hour after which AV203 is closed and the system held awaiting an operator command.
A4.5.2 Design Intention
To transfer by gravity from the measure vessel F2, and to completely react, 375 kg of component B with the stirred aqueous solution of the sodium salt of 425 kg of component A in F3. The transfer rate is to be controlled at 2 kg min by orifice plate OP1. The reaction tempera- ture in F3 is to be controlled in the range 55-60°C. On completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for 20-30 min before sam- pling. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in F2 and F3 at the flow rates established in previous steps.
Note 1
This report is from the first analysis by the team. Since the earlier steps in the process have already been studied, some deviations -for example, wrong amount of A is present-have already been considered. Entries will only occur for these deviations for new causes or new consequences suggested by the team. The team took one session developing this report. Note 2
The numbering system adopted is to have an item number for every row of the analysis and to relate the actions to that number. Where two or more actions result they are numbered as, for example, 14.1 and 14.2. Some action numbers are not used such as 15 and 16.

A response/comment column is available but not shown. It is used to enter the responses to the actions and to record any further comments by the HAZOP study team. Table A4.1 HAZOP study on steps 9 and 10(reaction and workout)(to be used in conjunction with figure A4.1, pages 126-127) Ref.

An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Procedure This study is loosely modeled on an article in the ICI Safety Newsletter No 32 August 1971. As the study is "hypothetical,"the working parameters of the up- and downstream processes are not available but this should not detract from demonstrating the study pro- cess. Also, as the study is clearly short and operations oriented, it does not justify a full team and the Facilitator may also act as Scribe. With the limited number of team members, some of the actions must be dealt with by someone outside of the study group who has the skills so to do. It is the responsibility of the person named in the study records to ensure that a competent person answers them and that they are implemented properly.
A5.1 BACKGROUND
This example is based upon the HAZOP study of a planned modifica- tion of an existing process operation (Figure A5.1).
An intermediate storage tank (IST) receives a C hydrocarbon stream (averaging 25 m/hour)from the reflux drum of an atmospheric pressure distillation column, run down on exit level control via the reflux pumps into the 250 m, nitrogen-blanketed tank. This conical- roofed tank serves as a buffer and temporary storage for the material before the C6 material is pumped by the J1 centrifugal pump, on level control, to the plant petrol blending unit. The IST operates at ambient temperature and at 500 Pa on split range pressure control and is inerted by nitrogen from the 1.3 bar site nitrogen supply. The tank is protected by a pressure (vacuum)valve (PV) set at -250/+ 750 Pa. It is in a bunded enclosure with an overflow, sealed with glycol, which empties into the bund. There is adequate instrumentation, including level indication with high- and low-level alarms and high-level trip plus temperature and pressure indication, all to the site control room.

Figure A5.1 P&ID for the existing process. Appendix 5: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Procedure 141 Figure A5.1 gives sufficient detail for the Procedural HAZOP and any deficiencies are outwith the scope of the study.
The modification is planned to remove the 100 m length of 100 mm diameter piping between the tank master isolation valve, V1, and the first pump isolation valve, V2, and to refit the pump closer to the tank, but first the flammable fluid (about 0.8 m3) must be removed. Consideration was given to draining it into a drum but the risks were considered to be unacceptable. In line with the corporate management of change policy, a Hazards Study approach (see Chapter 2) was adopted.
1. The inherently safer option (HS 0)of displacing the fluids with
nitrogen has been adopted. There is a nitrogen ring main on the site
which can be connected below valve V4. This link is fitted with a
non-return valve at the hose connection.
2. During the HS 2 analysis (FEED), it was recognized that this was
a non-standard operation with potential human factors (see
Section 10.2). It was recommended that all valves should be clearly
labeled (V1, etc.) and that a dummy run practice should be carried
out to debug the procedure and to familiarize the crew with the
operation.
3. During the HS 3, it was decided that a HAZOP study should be
carried out.
The final arrangement below (Figure A5.2)shows the 100 mm diameter suction line, the 25 mm diameter nitrogen header and a flexi- ble hose, and 18 mm diameter depressuring line with an isolation valve V6. All piping other than the hose will be hard piped.
An operational procedure has been drawn up which, in accordance with the MOC policy, is to be the subject to a Procedural HAZOP.

A5.2 DETAILED PROPOSED SEQUENCE
The operation will be carried out by an operator stationed near J1 who will be the lead operator and a second operator, in radio commu- nication, at the tank to operate valve V1. The lead operator will con- trol the procedure.
The initial set-up is for all valves V1-V6 closed and with the line between V1 and V2 containing C6 liquid.
1. Open V6 then open V5 to prove line clear of debris and to displace
any air in the hose.
2. Close V6 then open V4.
3. The operator at the J1 pump should open V2 slowly until fully
open.
4. The operator at the tank is then instructed to open V1 slowly by
one or two turns.
5. The operator at V1 should wait until nitrogen is heard passing
through the valve into the IST then the tank operator will close V1. 6. The tank operator should then cautiously reopen V1 by one or
two turns to ensure as much liquid as possible has been blown
back to the IST.
7. Close V4.
8. Close V1 after allowing any residual N2 in the line to depressure
into IST.
9. Pump-based operator to close V2.
10. Close V5.
11. Verify V2, V4, and V5 are all closed.
12. Open V6 to depressurize the line.
13. Disconnect the hose at V4.

Obviously, the final report cannot be written until the full HAZOP study has been completed. However, it is clear that there are a number of steps with potential for errors (human factors), it being a one-off operation and unfamiliar to the operations staff. There are also a num- ber of “unknowns.”Displacement (or blowing through) is a standard operation but it has significant implications when carried out within the constraints of this procedure. Is it a viable solution?
To date the key findings from nodes 1 and 2 are:
1. The procedure has missed the natural hogs and hollows in the line
between VI and V2 and any elevation changes between the nitro-
gen injection point and the IST which may make the procedure
nonviable.
2. There is potential for release of C6 at V6.
3. A possible overpressure of the IST following a N2 blow-by.
4. Step 4 is vague-one or two turns is not a measurable parameter
so there is potential for human error/factors.
5. The flow regime in the line from V2 to V1 is uncertain, and it is
not clear that the contents can be displaced in a controlled man-
ner. There is a potential conflict between transport of C6 and IST
integrity. Is there a better alternative?
6. The compatibility of the radios with the Hazardous Area
Classification.
7. It is a new one-off operation which needs some training (human
factors).
8. There is a need for labeling of all the valves (human factors).
9. The interpretation of the "end of clearing" using a subjective
"noise"(human factors) is not inherently safe.
10. There is a possibility of recontamination of the line following the
final blow out due to hydrostatic head in IST if the closure of V1
is delayed. The line V1-V2 must not be blown down into IST due
to the risk of recontamination. V1 must be closed first.
A5.5 AUTHORS NOTES ON THIS PROCEDURE
Valve V1 is a gate valve as the procedure says “open two turns.” Assuming that it is mounted vertically, the flow regime in the line from V1 to V2 will be very uncertain as the gap for liquid flow will be 150
Appendix 5: An Illustration of HAZOP Study for a Procedure
at the bottom of the line, and this will not necessarily be the low point-there could be "hogs and hollows" in the line especially if it slopes to the pump J1. A foam pig would pass the fully open gate valve V2 and be stopped by the partially open gate valve V1 (open one or two turns). This method would give a more complete line clearance and so a pig run may be preferable.
The objective of this exercise was to demonstrate the use of HAZOP in a procedure, but it has produced more issues than expected! This shows the strength of HAZOP. ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS
