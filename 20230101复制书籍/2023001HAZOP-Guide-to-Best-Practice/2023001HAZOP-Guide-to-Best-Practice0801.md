8.1 TEAM MEMBERS
It is good practice for team members to have been trained in the
HAZOP study technique. This is usually done through a formal train-
ing course covering the principles and the methodology of the tech-
nique. Experience can be given by the use of simple examples which
allow the key points to be illustrated, as well as showing important
aspects of preparing, leading, and recording the study. It is best if the
course is quickly followed by experience in an actual study so that the
learning points are reinforced and developed. Where an organization
regularly uses HAZOP and has many experienced and practiced team
members, it is possible to introduce a new member to a team after a
brief introduction to the method. Subsequent learning is then done by
working within a group of experienced practitioners. A recent develop-
ment has been the creation of online courses for training team
members. While these lack the interactions of group training methods,
they can be useful for individuals with an urgent need for training or
for those unable to access a group course.
8.2 SCRIBE
Formal training is not required provided the scribe understands the
categories and level of recording needed. However, it is helpful if the
scribe has been trained as a member and had sufficient exposure to
HAZOP studies so that issues requiring to be recorded can be recog-
nized promptly without instruction. If a computer recording program
is chosen, it is essential the scribe is trained in its use so that the
recording process does not delay the progress of the team. In a long
study, it is helpful to have a scribe who is also a trained leader; this
can allow roles to be rotated periodically.

8.3 TEAM LEADER
A team leader needs to develop and practice skills to:
understand and use the HAZOP method and structure;
manage the team effectively to optimize the contribution of all participants;
use their own technical knowledge and experience lightly so as not
to become the technical expert.
Thus, previous experience as a team member in a number of studies is important, preferably covering a range of different operations. Not all experienced HAZOP study members, however, can become success- ful leaders. It is also of value for the leader to have experience as a scribe in order to appreciate the particular problems with this task. Some formal training in leading, including practice undertaken along- side an established leader, is recommended. Initial experience should be gained on a low-risk process. As studies are led on higher risk pro- cesses, the degree of mentoring from a more experienced leader should be increased until the trainee becomes confident of how to address the nature of the hazards faced in such studies across a range of processes.
Obviously, the team leader must fully understand the HAZOP methodology and, during the meetings, must focus on applying this and making it effective. Equally important is man management- getting the best from the team members and the scribe. Having this skill is essential for good leadership; without it a leadership candidate should not be allowed to progress.
HAZOP study leaders should always critically review their perfor- mance after each study, if possible with the help of another experienced person from the team. It is important to maintain the skills of leading by regular usage, and this is helped if the company keeps a list of trained leaders with a record of the hazard study work done by each one.
