## 0501. Organizing a HAZOP Study

The detailed HAZOP study procedure described in the previous chapter needs to be fitted into an overall scheme. This chapter covers the preliminary organization while Chapter 6 covers the study itself.

前一章描述的详细 HAZOP（危害与可操作性分析）研究程序需要被整合到一个全面的方案中。本章将介绍初步的组织工作，而第 6 章将详细讨论研究的具体实施。

### 5.1 Defining The Scope And Objectives Of The Study And Establishing The Boundaries

These two aspects are not independent of each other although they are discussed separately. This part of the planning contributes significantly to the eventual quality of a HAZOP study. A clear definition of the scope and objectives is crucial to the whole study and should define the responsibilities and authority of the team (see also Section 6.1). It should also cover responsibility for initiation of the study, for followup and implementation of the actions, and how any rejected actions are dealt with. A well-defined set of objectives helps prevent the team straying into areas that are not relevant to the study. Quality assurance (QA) and auditing of the study should also be planned from the outset so that the study and the recording facilitate any later checks.17,18 

It is normal practice to include the identification of SHE risks as a principal objective, including risks to persons both on- and off-site, risks to property and plant, and all types of environmental risks. It must be made clear whether a further objective is to search for potential operability problems that by themselves have no SHE implications. These include reliability and maintenance issues, product quality or loss, and factors affecting plant life and productivity. Meeting regulations, company standards, and contractual performance requirements may also be a defined objective. Consideration should also be given to the intended uses for the study reports, in particular the need for audit and demonstration that a high standard has been reached in the identification of hazards and the assessment of risk. This may be required by both outside regulators and by insurance assessors. If it is expected that QA is required, the issues must be addressed during the definition of the scope.17

The boundaries for the study must be clearly defined as part of the specification of the study, including how any problems that extend beyond these boundaries will be handled. The first step is to identify those sections of the physical plant which are to be included. When boundaries are drawn, consideration is given to factors such as the nature of the process and the inherent hazards, the novelty of the operation, the complexity of the control system, and the relationship to other operating units. Where an existing plant is being considered, perhaps with a new process, it may be possible to omit from the study those sections that are used in a standard manner (although it may still be necessary to consider the effect that changes in the new section can have on the “standard” section). Also, if a standard unit or a proprietary unit is to be studied, it may be more effective to concentrate on the interfaces between that unit and other plant and operations. The unit may then be covered by comparison with a previously completed, full HAZOP study of the unit—an approach described as HAZOP by-difference. However, this should be done with care as there may be some small differences which could have a significant impact on operability.

When the study boundaries are drawn, there are likely to be interfaces with off-section elements of the plant such as drains, recycle lines, vents, and effluent treatment and perhaps sections of plant intended for occasional use for special purposes such as start-up lines. Consideration must be given to the inclusion of these within the HAZOP study, recognizing that interfaces with systems handling process materials are of potential importance. It is essential that such elements of the system are not overlooked simply because they are not on the drawings being used. The team needs to have an overview of the whole system so that important off-section causes and consequences are not overlooked, especially when associated with unusual events such as a plant trip. An interface review may be needed to clearly identify what crosses the boundaries.

There can be difficulties in setting boundaries when a modification to an existing plant is to be studied. As well as covering the modified sections of plant, it is usually necessary to extend the boundaries on either side to ensure that related sections, where causes of deviations that affect the modification and where consequences of deviations appear, are covered by the HAZOP study. It is a matter of judgment for the team leader.

Another aspect to be established at the outset of a study is the range of operational modes covered. For a continuously operating plant the main condition is the steady-state operation, but it is necessary to cover other modes such as start-up and shutdown (see Section 11.8), high and low rate running, hold conditions—particularly those anticipated during start-up—and changeover from one state to another. These may involve quite different pressure, temperature, or flow conditions compared to steady-state operation and may need detailed examination. Since many of them are discrete operations, they need to be examined using the batch HAZOP approach. For a batch operation, the additional modes could be special batches at the start and conclusion of a campaign or alternative control modes, such as fully automatic and partially manual. It is useful to think through the life cycle of the operation when deciding which alternative conditions should be included. It must be decided whether these alternative operational modes need separate examination or whether they can be covered under the guideword “other.”

It is not possible to estimate the length of a study or to plan in detail until these boundaries have been established.

5.1 确定研究范围和目标，并设立边界

尽管我们将分别讨论研究范围和目标这两个方面，但它们实际上是密切相关的。这个规划阶段对 HAZOP 研究的最终质量有着重大影响。明确定义研究的范围和目标对整个研究过程至关重要，它应该明确规定研究团队的职责和权限（详见第 6.1 节）。同时，还应该明确谁负责启动研究、跟进和实施行动计划，以及如何处理被否决的行动建议。一个定义清晰的目标集能够有效防止研究团队偏离重点，避免涉及与研究无关的领域。

此外，质量保证（QA）和审核工作也应该在研究开始之初就进行规划，这样可以确保研究过程和记录能够方便日后的检查和验证 [17,18]。这种前瞻性的规划对于保证 HAZOP 研究的完整性和有效性至关重要。

在风险评估中，将安全、健康和环境（Safety，Health and Environment，SHE）风险的识别作为主要目标是一种常见做法。这些风险包括对厂内和厂外人员的威胁、对财产和设备的损害，以及各种类型的环境隐患。

除此之外，我们还需要明确说明是否要将寻找潜在的运营问题作为另一个目标，即使这些问题本身可能不直接涉及 SHE 风险。这些运营问题可能包括：

1. 设备可靠性和维护方面的挑战
2. 产品质量问题或产量损失
3. 影响工厂使用寿命和生产效率的因素此外，满足法规要求、公司标准和合同性能指标也可能成为明确的评估目标。

在进行风险评估时，我们还应当考虑研究报告的预期用途。特别要注意的是，可能需要通过审计来证明我们在识别危害和评估风险方面已经达到了很高的标准。这不仅是为了满足外部监管机构的要求，也是为了应对保险评估人员的审查。

如果预计需要进行质量保证（Quality Assurance，QA），那么在定义评估范围的阶段就必须解决相关问题。[17]

在进行研究时，明确界定研究范围是规范化过程中的重要一环，这包括如何处理超出既定范围的问题。首先，我们需要确定哪些工厂设施将被纳入研究范围。在划定界限时，需要考虑多个因素，如生产过程的特性和潜在风险、操作的创新程度、控制系统的复杂性，以及与其他生产单元的关联性。

对于现有工厂，特别是引入新工艺时，我们可以考虑将那些使用标准方式运作的部分排除在研究之外（尽管仍需评估新工艺部分的变化对这些「标准」部分的潜在影响）。同样，在研究标准单元或专有单元时，可能更有效的方法是聚焦于该单元与其他工厂设施和操作之间的接口。

在这种情况下，我们可以采用一种称为「差异化危险与可操作性研究」（HAZOP by-difference）的方法。这种方法是将当前单元与之前完成的全面 HAZOP（危险与可操作性研究，Hazard and Operability Study）进行对比。然而，在使用这种方法时需要格外谨慎，因为即使是微小的差异也可能对设备的操作性能产生重大影响。

在进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）时，确定研究边界是一个关键步骤。这个过程中，我们可能会遇到与厂区主要部分以外的元素的接口。这些元素可能包括排水系统、物料回收线路、通风设施和废水处理装置，有时还会涉及一些仅在特殊情况下使用的设备，比如启动用的管线。

将这些元素纳入 HAZOP 研究范围是非常重要的，尤其是那些与工艺材料处理系统有关的接口，它们可能会对整个系统的安全性和可操作性产生重大影响。我们不能仅仅因为某些系统组件没有出现在当前使用的工程图纸上就忽视它们。HAZOP 团队需要对整个系统有全面的了解，以确保不会遗漏重要的厂外因素和潜在后果，这一点在处理异常事件（如工厂紧急停车）时尤为重要。为了清晰地识别跨越边界的所有内容，可能需要进行专门的接口审查。

当对现有工厂进行改造并需要进行 HAZOP 分析时，确定研究边界可能会变得更加复杂。除了要分析改造部分本身，通常还需要将研究范围向两侧适当扩展。这样做的目的是确保与改造相关的区域也被纳入 HAZOP 研究范围，包括可能导致偏差的原因所在区域，以及偏差可能产生后果的区域。如何恰当地划定这些边界，需要 HAZOP 团队负责人根据具体情况做出专业判断。

在开展研究之初，还需要确定研究所涵盖的操作模式范围。对于持续运行的工厂来说，主要关注的是稳定状态运行（steady-state operation），但也必须考虑其他模式，如启动和关闭（参见第 11.8 节）、高负荷和低负荷运行、保持状态（尤其是启动过程中预期出现的状态），以及不同状态之间的转换。这些模式可能涉及与稳定状态运行完全不同的压力、温度或流量条件，因此可能需要详细审查。由于其中许多是离散操作，需要采用批次危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）方法进行检查。对于批次操作，额外的模式可能包括生产开始和结束时的特殊批次，或者替代控制模式，如全自动和部分手动操作。在决定应包括哪些替代条件时，思考整个操作生命周期会很有帮助。我们需要决定是否对这些替代操作模式进行单独检查，还是可以在「其他」这个指导词下一并考虑。

在确定这些范围之前，无法估计研究所需的时间或制定详细计划。

### 5.2 Appointing A Team Leader And Selecting The Team

#### 5.2.1 The Team Leader/Facilitator

The selection of a team leader should be made at an early stage of the planning for a HAZOP study. An essential role of the team leader is to ensure the HAZOP methodology is used effectively and productively and so the leader needs to have a deep understanding and considerable experience of HAZOP studies. HAZOP study teams work best when there is clear leadership from an experienced leader. Desirable attributes for the leader include:

• wide experience of all the stages of process hazard studies, including QRA;

• extensive experience as a HAZOP study member and, preferably, some as a HAZOP study scribe;

• training in the leadership of HAZOP studies;

• technical competence and the ability to quickly understand the system and its operation;

• meticulous attention to relevant detail;

• good analytical thinking;

• motivational skills including the encouragement of creativity and open speaking;

• independence from the project itself with no other direct responsibility to the project manager other than completing the scope of the HAZOP study. The leader should be able to concentrate on the application of the method and the working of the team.

Independence from the project allows the leader to stand back and be able to take an objective, unbiased view. The leader acts, and is recognized to act, as an impartial person within the team. Freedom from other responsibilities is important because of the multiplicity of tasks already resting upon the leader. It is also advisable to check the suitability of the leader for the magnitude of the task, with only experienced and proven leaders given studies involving major hazards or other difficulties.

A good leader will have interpersonal skills that can be deployed to help the study group to function as a true team. These include the ability to listen, guide, and encourage individual contributions as and when required, to sense the unspoken feelings of individuals—perhaps indicated by their body language—to move the group toward a conclusion when a consensus is emerging and to work efficiently with the scribe. Within the HAZOP process, the leader directs the route taken through the stages, the parameters and guidewords. It may be necessary to vary from the preset plan by introducing new parameters and guidewords, to question doubtful issues and to defer examination—perhaps to gather more information—and to periodically review and remind the team of the key issues. The leader has responsibility for ensuring that the HAZOP study is functioning to a high standard and, if it is not, to call for changes which will restore these standards. In an extreme case, this could mean terminating a study until acceptable drawings, project information, or other team members are available.

A good leader working with a badly-selected team may be able to produce an adequate HAZOP study. The quality of the leader is critical and a good team cannot always negate the impact of a poor leader. If the team loses confidence in the leader, the study is doomed.

5.2 指定团队领导和选择团队成员

5.2.1 团队领导/引导员

在进行 HAZOP（危险与可操作性分析）研究的规划初期，就应该选定团队领导者。团队领导者的核心职责是确保 HAZOP 方法得到有效且高效的应用，因此领导者需要对 HAZOP 研究有深刻的理解和丰富的实践经验。事实证明，由经验丰富的领导者提供明确指导时，HAZOP 研究团队的表现最为出色。理想的团队领导者应具备以下特质：

·在工艺危害分析的各个阶段都有广泛经验，包括定量风险评估（QRA)；

·作为 HAZOP 研究团队成员有丰富经验，最好还担任过 HAZOP 研究的记录秘书；

·接受过 HAZOP 研究领导力培训；

·具备扎实的技术能力，能迅速理解系统及其运作机制；

·能够细致入微地关注相关细节；

·拥有出色的分析思维能力；

·具备激励团队的技能，包括鼓励创新思维和开放式讨论；

·能够保持独立于项目本身，除完成 HAZOP 研究的既定范围外，不对项目经理负有其他直接责任。领导者应能够专注于方法的应用和团队的协调工作。

项目的独立性使领导者能够保持一定距离，从而以客观公正的角度看待问题。领导者的行为方式应当体现出公正无私，并且在团队中被认可为公正的角色。减少其他职责对领导者来说很重要，因为他们已经肩负着诸多任务。此外，还应该评估领导者是否能够胜任该项目的规模。只有经验丰富、能力得到验证的领导者才应该被委以涉及重大危险或其他复杂情况的项目。

一位优秀的领导者应具备出色的人际沟通能力，这些能力可以帮助研究小组真正成为一个高效的团队。这些能力包括：适时倾听、引导和鼓励成员贡献想法；洞察成员未明确表达的想法和感受（这些往往通过肢体语言表现出来）；在意见趋于一致时引导小组得出结论；以及与记录员默契配合。在危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）过程中，领导者负责指导各个阶段的进行方向、确定参数和指导词。有时可能需要偏离预设计划，引入新的参数和指导词，对存疑的问题提出质疑，或推迟审查以收集更多信息，同时定期回顾并提醒团队关注核心问题。领导者有责任确保 HAZOP 研究保持高水准，如果未达标，则要采取措施恢复应有的水平。在极端情况下，可能需要暂停研究，直到获得合格的设计图纸、充分的项目信息或合适的团队成员。

即便面对一个人员搭配不当的团队，一个优秀的领导者仍有可能完成一项令人满意的 HAZOP 研究。领导者的能力至关重要，即便是一个出色的团队也难以弥补一个糟糕领导者带来的负面影响。一旦团队对领导者失去信心，整个研究就会陷入困境。

#### 5.2.2 Scribe (Scribe/Recorder)

The scribe is another key individual in the team. The person chosen must be familiar with the HAZOP study method and usually has a technical background so that special explanations are not required. The scribe must be a good listener, always paying attention to details. In a major study, the scribe has no other role, as recording is a full-time task. In a small study—for example, a modification—or on a self-sufficient small site, the recording may be done by the team leader or a team member. Note that experience shows that the scribe cannot be contributing to a discussion and writing at the same time so this inevitably slows the study.

The scribe should establish a working relationship with the leader to become a helper, not just a recorder. Help can be given by noting suggestions and deferred problems and bringing them up at a later time, and by assisting in the selection of guidewords and parameters. More directly, the scribe starts to record as a consensus appears, without waiting for instruction or dictation from the leader. To do this the scribe must learn when to write if recording manually (or to type if recording electronically)—starting too soon is a waste of effort while waiting for a final version to be dictated can slow the progress of the study and interferes with the creative flow of the discussion. The team should know exactly what has been recorded. This may be done by the leader reviewing the entry, the scribe reading it back or, if a computer recording program is in use, having it projected so all of the team can see the record.

The choice of computer recording over a simple written record is a matter of preference as both methods can produce good records. If a projector is used—as is common practice—it must be understood that during the meeting the priority is to capture the essential points of the analysis; spelling is not a high priority as it can be improved later but there must be no ambiguity or incompleteness in the first record.

It is important the study records are produced consistently and speedily after each session, particularly in a lengthy study, and that final and agreed versions are produced.

5.2.2 记录员（又称书记员或记录者）

书记员（scribe）是 HAZOP 研究团队中的另一个关键角色。HAZOP（危害与可操作性分析，Hazard and Operability Study）是一种系统性的风险评估方法。担任书记员的人必须熟悉 HAZOP 研究方法，通常还需要具备相关的技术背景，这样就不需要对专业术语进行额外解释。一个称职的书记员应该善于倾听，并且总是注意细节。

在大型 HAZOP 研究中，书记员的唯一任务就是记录，这是一项全职工作。然而，在小型研究中 —— 比如对某个系统进行修改分析 —— 或者在资源有限的小型场所，记录工作可能由团队领导或其他团队成员兼任。值得注意的是，实践经验表明，书记员无法同时参与讨论并进行记录，因此由专人担任书记员可以提高研究效率。如果由其他角色兼任，不可避免的会降低研究进度。

作为一名记录员，不应仅仅充当记录者的角色，而应与领导建立良好的工作关系，成为一名得力助手。记录员可以通过记录建议和未解决的问题，并在适当的时机提出，以及协助选择关键词（guidewords）和参数来提供帮助。更直接地说，当讨论中出现共识时，记录员应该主动开始记录，而不是被动地等待领导的指示或口述。

为了做到这一点，记录员必须掌握适当的记录时机，无论是手写还是电子输入。过早开始记录会浪费精力，而等待最终版本被口述则可能会拖慢研究进度，并打断讨论的创意思路。团队成员应该清楚地知道已经记录了哪些内容。这可以通过以下几种方式实现：由领导审阅记录内容，由记录员朗读记录，或者如果使用电脑记录程序，可以将内容投影出来，让所有团队成员都能看到。

至于选择使用电脑记录还是简单的书面记录，这主要取决于个人喜好，因为两种方法都能产生良好的记录效果。如果使用投影仪（这是常见做法），必须明确在会议期间，首要任务是捕捉分析的核心要点。拼写并不是最重要的，因为可以在之后进行修正。然而，第一份记录绝不能有任何模糊不清或不完整的地方。

在进行研究时，尤其是长期研究中，及时且一致地记录每次会议的内容至关重要。同时，我们还需要确保最终版本的研究记录得到所有相关人员的认可。

#### 5.2.3 Team Size and Membership

The size and composition of the team varies according to the complexity of the study. The minimum size for even the smallest study is probably four with some of the roles combined. Usually there is a core team of five or six. Occasionally, the number may be as large as eight or nine; team membership should be reviewed if this is exceeded. A typical team might involve the following personnel:

• team leader;

• scribe;

• process engineer;

• project/design engineer;

• plant/operations manager;

• operator (or commissioning team representative for a new design);

and one or more, as and when required, from;

• SHE expert (mandatory in some countries);

• research chemist;

• control/instrument engineer;

• maintenance/mechanical engineer;

• other specialists.

The essentials for the team members are that they have sufficient experience in the area of the operation and, as a group, have a comprehensive knowledge of the intended operation. In addition, the basic disciplines represented should ensure that a fundamental analysis of identified problems can be made. The key is the assembly of individuals who, together, provide the correct combination of basic disciplines and expertise, and general experience of the type of operation to cover all stages of the project. The disciplines needed may be a selection from chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineering, control systems engineering, chemistry, biochemistry, and other disciplines which offer specialist knowledge, when necessary, of reactors, piping, instrumentation, software, and metallurgy. General experience within the industry should average several years per member, including direct relevance to the intended operation with regard to the site, the method of control, and type of process. These latter aspects may be covered by the inclusion of a senior supervisor. Direct project involvement ranges from the initial research and development, earlier hazard studies, process design and the intended construction, commissioning, operations, control and maintenance groups.

It is possible that in complex processes which have a number of operating interests that the membership may be “dynamic.” If this is the case the new team members must be given sufficient time to appreciate the direction and dynamics of the HAZOP study and be able to fit into the team at the appropriate time. Likewise a departing member should be satisfied that there is no further use for his/her team membership before departing from the team.

Compromises often have to be made when selecting the team. The ideal persons may not be available and there can be difficulties if a big team results from an attempt to meet all of the criteria suggested above. In a large team—say nine or more—separate conversations may start, making it difficult for the leader to capture everything and disrupting the unity of the team. The leader must make a balance to achieve the best possible results. The potential for conflict is greater in a large team; it is a responsibility of the leader to be alert to developing problems and to prevent them from becoming major issues.

Whenever a new design or a modification to an existing plant is studied, the team should always include a representative from the design group, from the operations team, and it is likely to include an instrumentation engineer. Other team members are then chosen according to the nature of the project. Possible further members could be a mechanical engineer, development chemist, electrical engineer, software specialist, and safety specialist. It may be possible for the safety specialist to also act as the team leader. A good team is likely to have several members who are closely involved with the project and one or more who have little or no previous connection. It should not consist solely of those who have worked full time on the design nor should it be totally independent of the project. The interaction between these two groups can improve the quality of the study. Some companies like to have an independent process engineer present to act as a critical questioner and challenger of assumptions, another role that can be filled by a truly independent team leader who has the necessary background.

In a normal HAZOP study where several meetings are required, it is important to have the core team members present at all the study meetings. Apart from the development of a team style and spirit, this maximizes the benefits from the growing understanding of the operation that comes as the study progresses. If one member of the team is from an operating team working on shifts, however, it may be impractical to have the same individual present at all the meetings. Specialists are added to the team when their expertise is needed for a particular section or stage.

It is important that some of the team have previous experience of HAZOP study; if some have not participated before, then training should be considered. Provided a few members are experienced, the others can be introduced by a short example or, if a single individual is involved, by a briefing and then by participation within the otherwise practiced team.

5.2.3 团队规模和成员构成

研究团队的规模和组成会根据研究的复杂程度而有所不同。即使是最简单的研究，团队最少也需要四人，而且可能会有人同时担任多个角色。通常情况下，核心团队由五到六人组成。在某些情况下，团队成员可能会增加到八到九人；如果超过这个数量，就需要重新评估团队成员构成。一个典型的研究团队可能包括以下成员：

·团队领导：负责整体协调和决策

·记录员：负责会议记录和文档整理

·过程工程师：负责优化研究流程

·项目/设计工程师：负责具体项目设计和实施

·工厂/运营经理：负责生产运营相关事务

·操作员（或新设计项目的调试团队代表）：提供实际操作经验根据需要，还可能包括以下一个或多个专业人员：

·安全、健康与环境（SHE）专家（在某些国家是强制要求）

·研究化学家：提供化学相关的专业知识

·控制/仪器工程师：负责自动化控制和仪器设备

·维护/机械工程师：负责设备维护和机械系统

·其他相关领域的专家这种团队构成确保了研究过程中各个方面都有专业人员把关，从而提高研究的质量和效率。

对于团队成员来说，最重要的是他们在操作领域具备足够的经验，并且作为一个整体，对计划中的操作有全面的了解。此外，团队成员应具备各种专业背景，以确保能够对已识别的问题进行基础分析。组建团队的关键在于汇集那些共同具备适当专业知识、基础学科背景和丰富经验的人员，使他们能够覆盖项目的所有阶段。

团队所需的专业背景可能包括化学工程、机械工程、电气工程、控制系统工程、化学、生物化学等。在必要时，还可能需要在反应器、管道、仪器、软件和冶金等方面具有专业知识的其他学科背景。理想情况下，每位团队成员在行业内应有平均几年的总体经验，包括与计划中的操作直接相关的经验，如对特定场地、控制方法和工艺类型的熟悉。这些特定领域的经验也可以通过纳入一名高级主管来补充。

团队成员的直接项目参与范围应该广泛，从最初的研究和开发、早期的危害研究、工艺设计，一直到预期的建设、调试、操作、控制和维护等各个环节。这种全面的参与确保了团队能够从多个角度理解和管理整个项目。

在涉及多方利益的复杂过程中，团队成员可能会呈现「动态」变化。如果出现这种情况，新加入的成员需要足够的时间来了解危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）研究的方向和动态，并在适当的时机融入团队。同样，准备离开的成员在退出团队之前，应确保自己的角色已不再需要。

在组建团队时，我们往往需要做出一些妥协。最理想的人选可能无法到位，而如果为了满足上述所有标准而组建一个大团队，又可能会带来一些困难。在一个大团队中 —— 比如说九人或以上 —— 可能会出现小组讨论的情况，这会让领导者难以全面把握讨论内容，也会破坏团队的凝聚力。领导者必须在各方面取得平衡，以达到最佳效果。大团队中更容易产生冲突；领导者有责任警惕潜在问题的出现，并防止它们演变成重大问题。

在研究新的设计方案或对现有工厂进行改造时，项目团队的组成至关重要。团队中必须包括来自设计组和运营团队的代表，通常还会有一位仪器仪表工程师（instrumentation engineer）。其他成员则根据项目的具体需求来选择。可能会加入的成员包括机械工程师、研发化学师、电气工程师、软件专家和安全专家。有时，安全专家也可能兼任团队领导的角色。

一个优秀的团队通常由两类人员组成：一类是与项目密切相关的成员，另一类是此前与项目关系不大或完全无关的人员。这种组合很有必要，因为团队不应该只由全职参与设计的人员组成，也不应该完全脱离项目。这两类人员之间的互动可以大大提升研究的质量。

有些公司喜欢邀请一位独立的工艺工程师加入团队。这位工程师的作用是提出批评性问题，挑战现有假设，从而促进团队思考。这个角色也可以由一位真正独立的团队领导来担任，前提是该领导具备必要的专业背景。这种做法可以为项目带来新的视角，有助于发现潜在问题并提出创新解决方案。

在一个标准的危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）研究中，通常需要举行多次会议。核心团队成员参加所有会议至关重要。这不仅有助于建立团队的工作风格和凝聚力，还能让成员们随着研究的推进不断加深对操作流程的理解，从而最大化研究的效益。然而，如果团队中有来自轮班操作组的成员，要求他们参加所有会议可能不太现实。在研究过程中，当某个特定环节或阶段需要专业知识时，相关领域的专家会被临时加入团队。

确保团队中有部分成员具备 HAZOP 研究的经验很重要。如果有成员之前没有参与过，应当考虑为他们提供培训。只要有几名经验丰富的成员，新成员可以通过简短的案例学习来熟悉流程。如果只有一个新成员，可以先给他一个简要介绍，然后让他在有经验的团队中实际参与，以此来学习。

### 5.3 Preparation

It is important for the team leader to assemble and review the necessary data for the study and, if necessary, to reorganize the material for use by the team or to call for additional data. In this work, the leader may be assisted by a member of the design team and by the scribe. A site visit by the whole team can be very useful when an existing plant is studied but this is not always practical.

Knowledge of previous incidents on the plant or process being studied is important. A search should be made of appropriate accident databases to identify historic incidents relating to the type of process and to any specialized equipment being used. These may be corporate or international databases.

The boundaries for the study must be known and clearly stated. In the case of a continuous process, the boundaries will start at the feedstock and end at the final product distribution. It may be appropriate for a member of the plant producing the feedstock and another from the final user to partake in the appropriate phase of the HAZOP study. Minor changes in product specification as the result of a modification must be treated with care.

It is also necessary to plan the route the study will follow through the process; this must be done with care. There will be a number of branches and also heat exchangers which have process fluids on both sides. As a general guidance it is best to examine the route using the logical process flow but where there are branches or interactions, such as heat exchangers, it is appropriate to discuss the major issues that must be examined at the branch or on the other side of the heat exchange and then to make note of these for discussion at a later date. For example, the reduction in flow (low flow) on one side may have an impact on the other side of the heat exchanger and that process stream. Likewise a spared pump is a potential branch. It is appropriate to examine the interaction between the pumps but not to carry out a full HAZOP on each unit as that would be a repetition of effort. A note to the effect that the units are identical and only one plus the interactions was studied would be appropriate, provided the P&ID is truly identical in each case. Another issue might be the use of spared heat exchangers on fouling duty. The changeover and the impact of two heat sources on the process and pressure relief must be considered in detail. (See also the notes on vents and drains in Section 11.6.)

As a generalization a continuous process will start up (and shut down) in a “low flow mode.” This must be part of the study. Likewise the start-up and shut down will involve dynamic changes in pressure and temperature (see Section 11.8). The HAZOP study must examine the whole envelope of these parameters. In some cases, particularly compressors and pumps, the low flow mode may require special startup facilities which will only be used very occasionally. These must be examined with the same rigor as the rest of the process.

Following shut down the HAZOP study must examine the disposal or storage of off-specification materials which may contain contaminants including corrosive and toxic by-products.

This preplanning work is normally undertaken by the team leader, often with help from a member of the design team.

5.3 前期准备

工作团队领导的一项重要任务是收集并审核研究所需的所有资料。如有必要，领导还需要重新整理这些材料以便团队使用，或者要求提供额外的数据。在这个过程中，领导可能会得到设计团队成员和记录员的协助。如果研究对象是一个现有的工厂，组织整个团队进行实地考察通常会很有帮助，但这并不总是可行的。

了解正在研究的工厂或工艺过程中曾发生的事故是非常重要的。研究人员应该搜索相关的事故数据库，以找出与该类型工艺过程以及所使用的任何专用设备相关的历史事故记录。这些数据库可能是公司内部的，也可能是国际性的。

研究的范围必须明确并清楚地说明。对于连续性的工艺过程，研究范围通常从原料投入开始，直到最终产品分配结束。在适当的情况下，可以邀请原料生产工厂的代表和最终用户的代表参与危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP，Hazard and Operability Study）的相关阶段。需要特别注意的是，即使是由工艺修改引起的产品规格微小变化，也必须谨慎处理。

在进行研究时，仔细规划整个过程的路线也是必要的。在这个过程中，我们会遇到许多分支和热交换器，这些热交换器的两侧都有工艺流体。作为一般指导原则，最好按照逻辑工艺流程（即按照实际生产过程的顺序）来检查路线。但是，当遇到分支或相互作用时，比如热交换器，我们应该讨论在分支或热交换器另一侧需要检查的主要问题，然后记录下来，以便日后进行深入讨论。

举个例子，如果热交换器一侧的流量减少（低流量），可能会影响热交换器另一侧和相关的工艺流程。同样，备用泵也可以被视为一个潜在的分支。我们应该检查泵之间的相互作用，但不需要对每个泵单元都进行完整的危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP），因为这会导致工作重复。如果管道和仪表图（P&ID）在每种情况下确实相同，那么我们只需要注明这些单元是相同的，并且只研究了一个单元加上它们之间的相互作用，这样就足够了。

另一个可能需要考虑的问题是在容易结垢的工作条件下使用备用热交换器。我们必须详细考虑切换过程，以及两个热源对工艺过程和压力释放的影响。（关于排气和排液的更多信息，请参见第 11.6 节。）

通常，连续生产过程会以「低流量模式」启动（和关闭）。这必须作为研究的一部分。同样，启动和关闭过程会涉及压力和温度的动态变化（参见第 11.8 节）。危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP study）必须检查这些参数的全部变化范围。在某些情况下，特别是对于压缩机和泵，低流量模式可能需要特殊的启动设备，这些设备可能只会偶尔使用。这些设备也必须与生产过程的其他部分一样接受同等严格的检查。

在生产过程关闭后，HAZOP 研究还必须考虑如何处置或储存可能含有污染物（包括腐蚀性和有毒副产品）的不达标材料。

这些前期规划工作通常由团队领导负责，常常会得到设计团队成员的协助。

#### 5.3.1 Continuous Processes

For a good HAZOP study to be possible, it is necessary for the team to have a complete and accurate process representation. For continuous operations this is based upon the P&ID, supplemented by design specifications and other details used in the design work, including flow diagrams, and material and energy balances. Further items are the intended operating conditions—usually expressed as a range—the operating and control philosophy and methods, and equipment and instrument specifications. Relief settings are essential to allow verification of pipe and vessel specifications, and alarm and trip settings should be normally available. In addition, there should be material properties, hazards and known operating problems together with the basis for safety, site details, and demands on the site services, and the results of earlier hazard studies including any material and reaction investigations. Information on vendor packages needs to be available.

Once the required level of detail has been obtained, the next planning task is the division of the P&IDs into sections and items to which the guidewords can be applied. Alternative terms may be used to describe the blocks selected for examination. The term “section” is used in this guide for part of a continuous process to which the guidewords are applied; another frequently used term is “node.” The term “item” is sometimes used for vessels, exchangers, and so on, to which restricted or modified guidewords are applied. In a batch process, the terms step or stage are commonly used. A HAZOP study is a rigorous but time-consuming, and hence expensive, exercise. The higher the number of sections or steps, the more time-consuming is the study. Ideally, no sections should feature a process line junction and no steps should cover more than one element of the batch sequence. Experience suggests that some branching within a section and some step combination can be tolerated on systems other than those of very high hazard potential. Defining the intention helps demonstrate that the team have selected a worthwhile manageable node. Designation of the sections and steps is best undertaken by the leader at the outset of the study. Since this task is critical to the integrity of any HAZOP study, it is essential the leader has a proven track record in HAZOP management (see Section 5.2.1, page 31).

The selection of the sections is usually based upon the line diagram together with a description of the operating conditions. Often there are several possible ways of doing this division based upon the variation of parameters such as flow, pressure, temperature, and composition, at control points or junctions of lines with vessels. It is essential each section can be given a clear design intention and that a conceptual model can be constructed for the system in its given mode of operation. The size of the section contributes to effective analysis as there are problems in choosing either too small or too large a section. In the former case, there will probably be causes of deviations outside the section and consequences occurring upstream or downstream. There is a danger of these being overlooked. If too large a section is taken, then the design intention may be imprecise or very complicated so that it becomes difficult for the team to cover all possible meanings of each deviation. No simple, universal method can be given for the division into sections; experience is essential. The example in Appendix 3 provides an illustration.

It can be useful to mark each line and item of plant equipment as it is studied during the operating sequence. A final check can then be made to ensure all lines and items have been considered.

A further feature of continuous processes is that a high proportion of incidents and near misses occur when the plant is operated at conditions other than the steady state—for example, during start-up after maintenance, during commissioning, or shutdown. Therefore, it is important for the plan to give sufficient attention to these conditions and to the deviations that might occur in these situations—for example, too rapid heating or cooldown to the operating temperature, inadequate purging, or protective systems overridden. The team should also be mindful of the need for diagnostic instruments that will facilitate process performance monitoring and allow the assessment of local and wider heat and mass balances. These may be needed to allow assessment of heat exchanger performance, efficiency of pumps and compressors, and fouling of filters and piping, and can be of great importance during incidents.19 

During start-up, it is sometimes necessary to override protective systems such as low temperature or pressure trips during what is an unsteady operation with a high risk of upset. The HAZOP study must pay particular attention to the process dynamics and risks with the protective system overridden and how the protective system will be reset (see also Section 4.5, page 19).

5.3.1 连续生产过程

要进行一个优质的危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）研究，团队必须掌握完整而准确的工艺流程表示。对于连续操作而言，这主要基于管道仪表图（P&ID），并辅以设计规范和其他设计工作中使用的细节信息，包括流程图以及物料和能量平衡表。

除此之外，还需要以下信息：

1. 预期的操作条件：通常表示为一个范围
2. 操作和控制的理念与方法
3. 设备和仪器的规格说明安全阀的设置参数对于验证管道和容器规格至关重要，同时还应当提供警报和安全联锁的设置值。

此外，团队还需要掌握以下信息：

- 材料属性
- 潜在危险
- 已知的操作问题
- 安全基础
- 现场详细信息
- 对现场公用工程的需求
- 先前危险分析研究的结果，包括任何材料和反应性调查最后，供应商提供的成套设备信息也需要随时可供查阅。

通过整合这些全面的信息，HAZOP 团队能够更好地识别潜在的危险，并提出有效的改进建议，从而提高整个工艺的安全性和可操作性。

分区的选择通常依据管线图和操作条件的描述进行。在控制点或管线与容器的连接处，常常会出现几种可能的划分方式，这些方式基于流量、压力、温度和成分等参数的变化。关键在于，每个分区都必须有明确的设计目的，并且能够为系统在特定操作模式下建立一个概念模型。分区的大小对于有效分析至关重要，因为选择过小或过大的分区都会带来问题。如果分区过小，可能会导致偏差的原因位于分区之外，而其影响却发生在上游或下游，这样很容易被忽视。反之，如果分区过大，设计目的可能变得模糊或过于复杂，使得团队难以全面考虑每个偏差的所有可能含义。遗憾的是，对于分区划分并没有简单通用的方法，这更多地依赖于实践经验。附录 3 中提供了一个具体的例子作为参考。

在进行操作顺序分析时，对每条管线和设备项目进行标记是一个有效的方法。这样做可以在最后进行全面检查，确保所有的管线和设备都已被纳入考虑范围。这种系统性的方法有助于提高分析的完整性和准确性，从而增强整个过程的可靠性。

连续生产过程（continuous processes）还有一个重要特点：大多数事故和安全隐患发生在工厂运行状态偏离正常稳定条件时 —— 比如在维护后重新启动、设备调试或关闭过程中。因此，在制定计划时必须充分考虑这些特殊情况，以及可能出现的各种异常状况 —— 例如，升温或降温速度过快、系统清洗不彻底，或者安全保护系统被暂时停用等。此外，工作团队还应该意识到配备诊断仪器的重要性。这些仪器可以帮助监控生产过程的性能，并且能够评估局部和整体的热量与物质平衡情况。它们在评估热交换器性能、泵和压缩机效率、以及过滤器和管道堵塞程度等方面发挥着重要作用，特别是在发生事故时更显得尤为关键 [19]。

在启动过程中，由于操作条件不稳定且风险较高，有时可能需要暂时停用一些安全保护系统，如低温或低压自动停机装置。在这种情况下，危险与可操作性研究（HAZOP study）必须特别关注生产过程的动态特性和安全保护系统被停用时的潜在风险，同时还要考虑如何恢复这些保护系统的正常运行（详见第 4.5 节，第 19 页）。

#### 5.3.2 Batch Processes and Sequential Operations

The preparation work for a batch or sequential operation is usually more demanding than for a continuous process. In addition to the same range of background material, descriptions are also required of the detailed method of operation, the draft operating procedure, and the outline of the control sequence for a computer-controlled process. This time-dependent information is used in the division of the operation into stages for study, as illustrated in the example in Appendix 4. If a reaction is studied, the team needs information on the reaction process including heat and gas flows, exotherm onset temperatures, and the physical and chemical properties of the mixtures as well as the individual components. Again, the ability to define a design intention for each stage is an essential requirement.

One major difference between continuous and batch operations is that a physical item may need to be considered several times in a batch HAZOP study as the status, conditions, and design intention change. Thus, a reaction vessel may be considered during the addition of each component of the reaction mixture, during the reaction stage itself, and then during cooling and discharge. Another example is the common pipeline operation of pigging, where a typical sequence involving the loading of a scraper pig into a pig launcher at the start of the operation might be:

• Check the initial conditions.

• Open the LP flare valve and vent the vessel.

• Open the drain valve. Allow the launcher vessel to drain for 5 min.

Then close the drain valve, leaving the launcher drained and at LP flare pressure.

• Close the LP flare valve and purge the pig launcher with inert gas by repeated pressurization to 5 barg and then venting to the LP flare until hydrocarbon gas tests show it is gas-free as measured at a representative sample point.

• Lock open the atmospheric vent valve and lock closed the drain valve and master isolation valves, leaving the vessel at atmospheric pressure.

• Check double block valve vents for any sign of leakage.

• Open closure door, load the scraper, and then shut the closure door.

The scraper is now loaded but not launched.

The pig launcher is at the center of each of these steps but each one involves a different configuration and usually different contents and pressures. The main issues will differ from step to step as will the design intention. Hence, the parameters will vary between the steps. Each of these steps should be considered separately, using the full round of guidewords each time to ensure that the hazards are fully examined.

Further requirements for batch process HAZOP studies are intended trip settings for both the control system and the safety system, including those that take place between successive stages of the process. The HAZOP team must take into account the manner and timing of the resetting of the control and trip systems, covering both safety and operability aspects.

Another difference from continuous processes is the need for the team to picture the whole operation and the changing conditions throughout the plant at all stages of the batch. Without this understanding, interactions and consequences may be overlooked. Indeed, as the progress of one batch is followed through its various stages, a previous batch may still be in a connected section of the plant and preparations for a following batch may be underway. Thus, a deviation in the batch being followed through may cause an interaction with the previous or the following batch and so have consequences for these batches. The HAZOP study team needs to have a clear overall picture to enable it to identify such cross-connections; time-related flow charts, for example, a bar chart, are needed to give this picture. Such charts are unlikely to be available from the design work and, if needed, must be prepared for the HAZOP study. Good preparation and organization of the data can greatly enhance the prospects of success in batch operations.

5.3.2 批处理过程和顺序操作

相比连续性生产过程，批量或顺序操作的准备工作通常更为复杂和严格。除了需要相同范围的背景资料外，还需要提供详细的操作方法、操作程序草案，以及计算机控制过程的控制序列概述等描述。这些随时间变化的信息用于将整个操作划分为不同的研究阶段，就像附录 4 中的例子所展示的那样。如果研究的是一个化学反应，团队则需要了解有关反应过程的各种信息，包括热量和气体的流动情况、反应开始放热的温度（即放热起始温度），以及混合物及其各个组分的物理和化学性质。再次强调，能够为每个阶段明确定义设计目的和预期结果是一项基本要求。

连续操作和批量操作之间的一个主要区别在于，在批量的危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）研究中，可能需要多次考虑同一个物理设备或部件，因为它的状态、条件和设计目的会随着操作的进行而发生变化。例如，在研究一个反应容器时，可能需要分别考虑反应混合物的每个组分的添加过程、反应阶段本身，以及后续的冷却和排放过程。另一个例子是常见的管道清管操作，这是一种使用特殊工具（俗称「猪」）来清洁或检查管道的方法。在操作开始时，将清管器装入发射装置的典型步骤可能是：

·检查初始条件。

·打开低压火炬阀并排空容器。

·打开排水阀，让发射器容器排水 5 分钟。

然后关闭排水阀，使发射器保持排空状态，并处于低压火炬系统的压力下。

·关闭低压火炬阀，然后用惰性气体清洗管道清管器发射装置（简称「猪发射器」）。清洗过程如下：重复将压力提升至 5 巴表压（barg），然后排放到低压火炬。重复此过程，直到在代表性取样点的烃气测试显示无气体残留为止。

·锁定并打开大气排放阀，同时锁定并关闭排水阀和主隔离阀，使容器保持在大气压力下。

·检查双重截止阀的排气口，确认是否有任何泄漏迹象。

·打开关闭门，装入清管器，然后关闭关闭门。

此时，清管器已装载完毕，但尚未发射。

猪发射器是上述每个步骤的核心，但每个步骤都涉及不同的配置，通常还有不同的内容物和压力。主要问题和设计意图会随着步骤的不同而变化。因此，各个步骤之间的参数也会有所不同。在进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）时，应该分别考虑每个步骤，每次都使用完整的指导词列表，以确保全面检查可能存在的危险。

对于批处理过程的 HAZOP 研究，还有一些额外要求。这包括确定控制系统和安全系统的预期跳闸设置，其中也涵盖了在过程连续阶段之间发生的设置。HAZOP 团队必须考虑控制和跳闸系统重置的方式和时机，同时兼顾安全性和可操作性两个方面。

批量生产过程与连续生产过程的另一个显著区别在于，团队需要在批次生产的各个阶段中全面把握整个操作流程和工厂内不断变化的条件。缺乏这种全局理解，可能会导致忽略某些相互影响和潜在后果。实际上，当我们跟踪一个批次的生产进程时，前一个批次可能仍在工厂的相关区域进行处理，而下一个批次的准备工作也可能已经开始。因此，当前批次的任何偏差都可能与前一个或后一个批次产生交互，进而影响到这些批次的生产。

危害与可操作性分析（HAZOP）研究团队需要有一个清晰的整体视角，以便识别这些批次之间的相互关联。为了呈现这种整体画面，需要使用时间相关的流程图，比如甘特图。这类图表通常不会在设计阶段就准备好，因此如果需要的话，必须专门为 HAZOP 研究制作。充分的数据准备和有效的组织可以极大地提高批量操作的成功率。

#### 5.3.3 HAZOP Study of a Procedure

Many operations, both simple and complex, are dynamic and are done by following a strict, predetermined procedure. Any failure to strictly adhere to the procedure or to ensure all the steps are done in the correct order may have the potential for a serious consequence. Startup and shut down operations normally follow a sequence set out in a procedure, and these operations are known to be common occasions for problems and incidents. Hence, all procedures should be considered for evaluation by HAZOP study. The general principles of HAZOP study, as discussed in this monograph, hold good but the approach has to be altered to get the best results. This is described below and illustrated in Appendix 5.

The major difference from the examination of a steady-state operation is that procedures are carried out in a chronological order and so each step must be considered in turn and be challenged by appropriate guidewords. Thus, instead of traditional parameters such as flow, and guidewords such as more, potential problems are more likely to be uncovered by deviations such as operation mistimed or guidewords such as too early/too late or out of sequence. However, this does not preclude the use of the usual parameters and guidewords used in the HAZOP study of steady-state processes.

As ever, the team must have a clearly defined node and design intention for the step being examined. The node may be a piece of equipment such as a pump or a pig launcher. It may be a section of line, as might be selected for steady-state HAZOP study, but where the flow is not fixed but is dynamic due to moment-by-moment changes during the procedure. The node may include a number of simple operations that comprise a clear section of the procedure, for example, a series of valve changes in starting a pump or changes of flow, quantity, and temperature for the start-up, shut down, or conditioning of a reactor. Arriving at the best selection of nodes is often more difficult than when planning for a continuous process HAZOP study.

The choice of guidewords is also more challenging. The guidewords too early/too late, out of sequence or incomplete, could identify missed venting in the pump start-up or residues left in the reactor. Further possible guidewords are tabulated in Section 10.2 on Human Factors. Of course the standard guidewords given in Table 4.1 should also be used if they generate meaningful deviations with the parameters of the node.

Good practice, as with HAZOP study of steady-state operations, is to identify appropriate guidewords and parameters before the study is commenced, and it is the responsibility of the team to adapt the method of study to suit the problem being examined.

5.3.3 程序的 HAZOP 研究

无论是简单还是复杂的操作，许多都是动态的，需要遵循严格、预先制定的程序来执行。如果不能严格遵守程序或确保所有步骤按正确顺序完成，可能会导致严重后果。特别是启动和关闭操作，通常需要按照程序规定的顺序进行，而这些操作也被认为是容易出现问题和事故的常见场合。因此，所有操作程序都应该考虑进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）研究评估。本文讨论的 HAZOP 研究的一般原则仍然适用，但为了获得最佳结果，具体方法需要进行调整。下面我们将详细描述这种调整，并在附录 5 中进行举例说明。

与稳定状态下的操作检查相比，程序性操作评估的主要区别在于：程序是按时间顺序进行的，因此必须依次考虑每个步骤，并用适当的引导词（guideword）进行质疑。例如，相比于使用传统参数（如流量）和引导词（如「更多」）的方式，我们更可能通过考虑「操作时机不当」这样的偏差，或使用「过早/过晚」、「顺序错误」等引导词来发现潜在问题。当然，这并不意味着我们要完全放弃在稳定状态过程的 HAZOP 研究中常用的参数和引导词。

通过这种调整后的方法，我们可以更全面地评估动态操作过程中的潜在风险，从而提高操作的安全性和可靠性。

在进行危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）时，团队必须为每个被检查的步骤明确定义检查点和设计意图，这一点至关重要。这里的检查点可能是一台设备，比如泵或管道清洁装置发射器。它也可能是管道的一个区段，类似于在稳定状态 HAZOP 研究中选择的区段，但不同的是，这里的流量并非固定不变，而是会随着操作过程中的每一刻变化而动态变化。检查点还可能包括构成操作程序中某个明确部分的一系列简单操作，例如启动泵时的一系列阀门操作，或者启动、关闭、调节反应器时的流量、数量和温度变化等。与规划连续过程的 HAZOP 研究相比，为批处理过程选择最佳检查点往往更具挑战性。

选择合适的引导词也是一个更具挑战性的任务。例如，「太早/太晚」、「顺序错误」或「不完整」等引导词可能有助于识别泵启动过程中遗漏的排气步骤，或者反应器中残留的物质。在本书第 10.2 节的人为因素部分还列出了更多可能的引导词。当然，如果表 4.1 中列出的标准引导词能够与检查点的参数产生有意义的偏差，也应该考虑使用。

与稳定状态操作的 HAZOP 研究类似，一个好的实践是在研究开始之前就确定适当的引导词和参数。同时，研究团队有责任根据所研究的具体问题调整研究方法。
