## 0501. Finding Projects that Complement Your Career Goals

It goes without saying that we should only work on projects that are responsible, ethical, and beneficial to people. But those limits leave a large variety to choose from. In the previous chapter, I wrote about how to identify and scope AI projects. This chapter and the next have a slightly different emphasis: picking and executing projects with an eye toward career development.

A fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact over time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to bigger projects as your skills grow.

When you’re starting out, don’t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter. Many people start by working on small projects in their spare time. With initial successes — even small ones — under your belt, your growing skills increase your ability to come up with better ideas, and it becomes easier to persuade others to help you step up to bigger projects.

What if you don’t have any project ideas? Here are a few ways to generate them:

Join existing projects. If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project. Keep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of time reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’m confident that you will, too.

Focus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology — say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language models — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard. But the variety of applications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate to have been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to online advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on those applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore the possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative application — one where you can do unique work — that no one else has done yet.

Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not develop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with collaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn’t part of my “job” (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often worked on out of passion for education. My early experiences in recording videos at home helped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley abounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. As long as it doesn’t create a conflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.

Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into? Here’s a quick checklist of factors to consider:

Will the project help you grow technically? Ideally, it should be challenging enough to stretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you on a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.

Do you have good teammates to work with? If not, are there people you can discuss things with? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge impact on your growth.

Can it be a stepping stone? If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/ or business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? If the project is bigger than those you’ve worked on before, there’s a good chance it could be such a stepping stone.

Finally, avoid analysis paralysis. It doesn’t make sense to spend a month deciding whether to work on a project that would take a week to complete. You'll work on multiple projects over the course of your career, so you’ll have ample opportunity to refine your thinking on what’s worthwhile. Given the huge number of possible AI projects, rather than the conventional “ready, aim, fire” approach, you can accelerate your progress with “ready, fire, aim.”

Ready, Fire, Aim

Working on projects requires making tough choices about what to build and how to go about it. Here are two distinct styles:

✓ Ready, Aim, Fire: Plan carefully and carry out careful validation. Commit and execute only when you have a high degree of confidence in a direction.

✓ Ready, Fire, Aim: Jump into development and start executing. This allows you to discover problems quickly and pivot along the way if necessary.

Say you’ve built a customer-service chatbot for retailers, and you think it could help restaurants, too. Should you take time to study the restaurant market before starting development, moving slowly but cutting the risk of wasting time and resources? Or jump in right away, moving quickly and accepting a higher risk of pivoting or failing?

Both approaches have their advocates, and the best choice depends on the situation.

Ready, Aim, Fire tends to be superior when the cost of execution is high and a study can shed light on how useful or valuable a project could be. For example, if you can brainstorm a few other use cases (restaurants, airlines, telcos, and so on) and evaluate these cases to identify the most promising one, it may be worth taking the extra time before committing to a direction.

Ready, Fire, Aim tends to be better if you can execute at low cost and, in doing so, determine whether the direction is feasible and discover tweaks that will make it work. For example, if you can build a prototype quickly to figure out if users want the product, and if canceling or pivoting after a small amount of work is acceptable, then it makes sense to consider jumping in quickly. When taking a shot is inexpensive, it also makes sense to take many shots. In this case, the process is actually Ready, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire.

After agreeing upon a project direction, when it comes to building a machine learning model that’s part of the product, I have a bias toward Ready, Fire, Aim. Building models is an iterative process. For many applications, the cost of training and conducting error analysis is not prohibitive. Furthermore, it is very difficult to carry out a study that will shed light on the appropriate model, data, and hyperparameters. So it makes sense to build an end-to-end system quickly and revise it until it works well.

But when committing to a direction means making a costly investment or entering a one-way door (meaning a decision that’s hard to reverse), it’s often worth spending more time in advance to make sure it really is a good idea.

寻找与你的职业目标相得益彰的项目

不言而喻，我们应该只从事负责任的、合乎道德的、对人们有益的项目。但是这些限制留下了很大的选择余地。在前一章中，我写了如何识别和确定 AI 项目的范围。这一章和下一章的重点略有不同：挑选和执行项目时着眼于职业发展。

一个富有成效的职业生涯将包括许多项目，希望随着时间的推移，其范围、复杂性和影响都在增长。因此，从小处着手是很好的。利用早期的项目来学习，并随着技能的增长逐渐升级到更大的项目。

当你刚起步时，不要指望别人会把好主意或资源放在盘子里交给你。许多人从业余时间做小项目开始。随着最初的成功 —— 即使是很小的成功 —— 在你的腰带下，你不断增长的技能增加了你提出更好想法的能力，并且说服别人帮助你进入更大的项目变得更容易。

没有什么项目创意怎么办？以下是生成它们的几种方法：

加入现有项目。如果你发现其他人有想法，要求加入他们的项目。

坚持阅读和与人交谈。每当我花大量时间阅读、学习课程或与领域专家交谈时，我都会产生新的想法。我相信你也会的。

专注于一个应用领域。许多研究人员试图推进基本的人工智能技术比如说，通过发明下一代变形金刚或进一步扩大语言模型 —— 所以，虽然这是一个令人兴奋的方向，但也非常困难。但是机器学习尚未应用的应用种类繁多！我很幸运能够将神经网络应用于从自主直升机飞行到在线广告的所有事情，部分原因是我在相对较少的人从事这些应用时加入了进来。如果你的公司或学校关心某个特定的应用，探索机器学习的可能性。这可以让你第一次看到一个潜在的创造性应用程序 —— 一个你可以做独特工作的应用程序 —— 还没有人做过 。

发展一个侧推。即使你有一份全职工作，一个有趣的项目，可能会也可能不会发展成更大的东西，可以激发创造力，加强与合作者。当我还是一名全职教授时，从事在线教育并不是我「工作」的一部分（那就是做研究和授课）。这是一个有趣的爱好，出于对教育的热情，我经常从事这项工作。我早期在家录制视频的经历帮助我后来以更实质性的方式从事在线教育。硅谷有很多以副业起家的创业公司的故事。只要不与你的雇主产生冲突，这些项目可以成为有意义的事情的垫脚石。

给定几个项目想法，你应该跳进哪一个？以下是需要考虑的因素的快速清单：

这个项目会帮助你在技术上成长吗？理想情况下，它应该有足够的挑战性来拓展你的技能，但不要太难，以至于你成功的机会很小。这会让你在掌握越来越大的技术复杂性的道路上。

你有好的队友一起工作吗？如果没有，有你可以讨论事情的人吗？我们从周围的人那里学到了很多，好的合作者将会有一个巨大的对你成长的影响。

能成为垫脚石吗？如果项目成功，其技术复杂性和 / 或者业务影响使其成为更大项目的有意义的垫脚石？如果这个项目比你以前做过的更大，它很有可能成为你的垫脚石。

最后，避免分析瘫痪。花一个月的时间来决定是否去做一个需要一周才能完成的项目是没有意义的。在你的职业生涯中，你会参与多个项目，所以你会有足够的机会来完善你对什么是值得的思考。考虑到大量可能的人工智能项目，而不是传统的「准备，瞄准，开火」方法，你可以用「准备，开火，瞄准」来加速你的进度。

准备，开火，瞄准

从事项目工作需要做出艰难的选择，比如构建什么以及如何进行。这里有两种不同的风格：

1、准备，瞄准，开火：仔细计划，进行仔细验证。只有当你对一个方向有高度的信心时，才承诺和执行。

2、准备，开火，瞄准：投入开发并开始执行。这可以让你快速发现问题，并在必要时继续前进。

假设你已经为零售商建立了一个客户服务聊天机器人，你认为它也可以帮助餐馆。在开始开发之前，你是否应该花时间研究餐饮市场，缓慢发展，但减少浪费时间和资源的风险？还是马上投入，快速行动，接受更高的旋转或失败风险？

这两种方法都有其支持者，最佳选择取决于具体情况。

当执行成本很高时，Ready，Aim，Fire 往往更胜一筹，一项研究可以揭示一个项目有多有用或有多有价值。例如，如果您可以头脑风暴几个其他用例（餐馆、航空公司、电信公司等等），并评估这些用例以确定最有希望的一个，那么在承诺一个方向之前花额外的时间可能是值得的。

如果你能以低成本执行，并在这样做的过程中，确定方向是否可行，并发现使其工作的调整，那么准备、开火、瞄准往往会更好。例如，如果您可以快速构建一个原型来确定用户是否想要该产品，如果在少量工作后取消或旋转是可以接受的，那么考虑快速投入是有意义的。当拍一张不贵的时候，拍很多张也是有意义的。在这种情况下，过程实际上已经准备好了，开火，瞄准，开火，瞄准，开火，瞄准，开火。

在就项目方向达成一致后，当涉及到构建作为产品一部分的机器学习模型时，我倾向于 Ready ，Fire，Aim。建立模型是一个迭代的过程。对于许多应用来说，训练和进行误差分析的成本并不高。此外，很难进行一项研究来阐明适当的模型、数据和超参数。所以快速构建一个端到端的系统，并对其进行修改，直到它工作良好，这是有意义的。

但是，当承诺一个方向意味着进行昂贵的投资或进入单行道（意味着难以逆转的决定）时，通常值得提前花更多时间来确保它确实是一个好主意。
