# 0101. The structures In our lives

— or how to communicate with engineers

As men journeyed in the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, ' Come, let us make bricks and bake them hard'; they used bricks for stones and bitumen for mortar. ' Come, ' they said, ' let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and make a name for ourselves; or we shall be dispersed all over the earth.' Then the Lord came down to see the city and tower which mortal men had built, and he said, 'Here they are, one people with a single language, and now they have started to do this; henceforward nothing they have a mind to do will be beyond their reach. Come, let us go down there and confuse their speech, so that they will not understand what they say to one another.' So the Lord dispersed them from there all over the earth, and they left off building the city. That is why it is called Babel (that is, Babylon), because the Lord there made a babble of the language of all the world.

Genesis 11.2–9 (New English Bible)

A structure has been defined as 'any assemblage of materials which is intended to sustain loads', and the study of structures is one of the traditional branches of science. If an engineering structure breaks, people are likely to get killed, and so engineers do well to investigate the behaviour of structures with circumspection. But, unfortunately, when they come to tell other people about their subject, something goes badly wrong, for they talk in a strange language, and some of us are left with the conviction that the study of structures and the way in which they carry loads is incomprehensible, irrelevant and very boring indeed.

Yet structures are involved in our lives in so many ways that we cannot really afford to ignore them: after all, every plant and animal and nearly all of the works of man have to sustain greater or less mechanical forces without breaking, and so practically everything is a structure of one kind or another. When we talk about structures we shall have to ask, not only why buildings and bridges fall down and why machinery and aeroplanes sometimes break, but also how worms came to be the shape they are and why a bat can fly into a rose-bush without tearing its wings. How do our tendons work? Why do we get 'lumbago'? How were pterodactyls able to weigh so little? Why do birds have feathers? How do our arteries work? What can we do for crippled children? Why are sailing ships rigged in the way they are? Why did the bow of Odysseus have to be so hard to string? Why did the ancients take the wheels off their chariots at night? How did a Greek catapult work? Why is a reed shaken by the wind and why is the Parthenon so beautiful? Can engineers learn from natural structures? What can doctors and biologists and artists and archaeologists learn from engineers?

As it has turned out, the struggle to understand the real reasons why structures work and why things break has been a great deal more difficult and has taken much longer than one might have expected. It is really only quite recently that we have been able to fill in enough of the gaps in our knowledge to answer some of these questions in any very useful or intelligent manner. Naturally, as more of the bits of the jig-saw puzzle are assembled, the general picture becomes clearer: the whole subject is becoming less a study for rather narrow specialists and more one which the ordinary person can find rewarding and relevant to a wide range of general interests.

This book is about modern views on the structural element in Nature, in technology and in everyday life. We shall discuss the ways in which the need to be strong and to support various necessary loads has influenced the development of all sorts of creatures and devices – including man.

如何与工程师无障碍地沟通

人们向东迁徙的时候，在示拿地遇见一片平原，便定居在那里。他们互相商量：「来吧，让我们制作砖块，把砖烧透了。」他们就以砖块为石，又以柏油为浆。「来吧，」他们说，「让我们为自己建造一座城和一座塔，塔顶通天，传扬我们的声名，免得我们流散到四面八方。」耶和华降临，要看看凡人所建造的城和塔。耶和华说：「他们在此，为同一种族，用同一语言，如今他们已开始如此行事，此后他们意欲所为便没有办不到的了。来吧，让我们下凡去那儿，搅乱他们的言说，使他们彼此无法沟通。」于是，耶和华使他们从那里流散到四面八方，他们便停止造城了。这就是为何那里被叫作巴别（即巴比伦），因为上帝在那儿搅乱了世间的语言。

——《圣经·旧约全书·创世记》（Genesis 11: 2-9）

结构曾被定义为任何用于承受载荷的材料的组合，而研究结构是科学的传统分支之一。如果一个工程结构倒塌，就可能出现人员伤亡，因此工程师务必小心谨慎地探究结构的行为。然而遗憾的是，当工程师要向大家普及他们的专业时，麻烦就来了：他们总是说着奇怪的用语，于是一些人便会认为，研究结构及其负载的方式的确令人费解、无关紧要，也非常无聊。

但是，结构无处不在，我们实在没法视而不见：毕竟，所有动植物以及几乎所有的人造物都必须能够承受某种强度的机械性力量而不致损坏，所以实际上，万物皆有结构。当我们谈论结构时，我们不仅要问为何建筑和桥梁不会坍塌，机器和飞机为何有时会坏掉，还需要问蠕虫为何长成那种形态，以及蝙蝠为什么能飞过玫瑰花丛而保持翅膀完好无损。我们的肌腱如何工作？我们为何会「腰酸背痛」？翼手龙的体重怎么那么轻？鸟类为何有羽毛？我们的动脉如何工作？我们能为残疾儿童做些什么？为什么帆船要那样装配帆索？为什么奥德修斯之弓很难拉开？为什么古人晚上要把战车的轮子卸下来？希腊投石机如何工作？为什么芦苇会随风摇曳？为什么帕提侬神庙如此壮美？工程师能从天然结构中得到什么启示？医生、生物学家、艺术家和考古学家能从工程师那儿学到些什么？

事实表明，理解结构的原理和损坏的原因是一场斗争，其艰难与漫长远非常人所能预料。直到最近，我们才补上了所欠的知识，使得我们能以某些有效或巧妙的办法回答上述一部分问题。当然，随着将更多块拼图汇集组装，整个图景越发清晰：这门学科整体上不再局限于专业研究的狭窄范围，而越发贴近大众的普遍利益，普通人从中也能有所收获。

本书讲述了关于自然界、工程技术和日常生活中的结构元素的现代观点，探讨了对强度及支持不同载荷的需求如何影响各种生命体和机械装置的发展，包括人的进化。

## 1.1 The living structure

Biological structures came into being long before artificial ones. Before there was life in the world, there was no such thing as a purposive structure of any kind – only mountains and heaps of sand and rock. Even a very simple and primitive kind of life is a delicately balanced, self-perpetuating chemical reaction which needs to be separated and guarded from non-life. Nature having invented life – and with it individualism – it became necessary to devise some kind of container in which to keep it. This film or membrane had to have at least a minimum of mechanical strength, both to contain the living matter and also to give it some protection from outside forces.

If, as seems possible, some of the earliest forms of life consisted of tiny droplets floating in water, then a very weak and simple barrier, perhaps no more than the surface tension which exists at the interfaces between different liquids, may have sufficed. Gradually, as living creatures multiplied, life became more competitive, and the weak, globular and immobile animals were at a disadvantage. Skins became tougher and various means of locomotion were evolved. Larger, multicellular animals appeared which could bite and could swim fast. Survival became a matter of chasing and being chased, eating and being eaten. Aristotle called this allelophagia – a mutual eating – Darwin called it natural selection. In any case, progress in evolution was dependent upon the development of stronger biological materials and more ingenious living structures.

The earlier and more primitive animals were mostly made from soft materials because they not only make it much easier to wriggle and extend oneself in various ways, but soft tissues are usually tough (as we shall see), while rigid ones like bone are often brittle. Furthermore, the use of rigid materials imposes all kinds of difficulties in connection with growth and reproduction. As women know, the business of giving birth involves an engineering of high strains and large deflections. All the same, the development of the vertebrate foetus from conception onwards, like that of natural structures in general, is in certain respects from soft to hard, and the hardening process goes on after the baby has emerged.

One gets the impression that Nature has accepted the use of stiff materials rather reluctantly, but, as animals got bigger and came out of the water on to the land, most of them developed and exploited rigid skeletons, teeth and sometimes horns and armour. Yet animals never became predominantly rigid devices like most modern machinery. The skeleton usually remained but a small part of the whole, and, as we shall see, the soft parts were frequently used in clever ways to limit the loads upon the skeleton and thus to protect it from the consequences of its brittleness.

While the bodies of most animals are made preponderantly from flexible materials, this is not always true for plants. The smaller and more primitive plants are usually soft, but a plant cannot chase its food, nor can it run away from an enemy. It can, however, protect itself to some extent by growing tall, and, by doing so, it may also be able to get more than its fair share of sun and rain. Trees, in particular, seem to be extraordinarily clever at stretching out to collect the diffuse and fitful energy of sunlight and at the same time standing up to being bullied by the wind -and all in the most cost-effective way. The tallest trees reach a height of about 360 feet or 110 metres, being by far the largest and most durable of living structures. For a plant to reach even a tenth of this height, however, its main structure needs to be both light and rigid; we shall see later that it incorporates a number of important lessons for engineers.

It may seem obvious that questions like these about strength and flexibility and toughness are relevant in medicine and in zoology and botany, yet for a long time both doctors and biologists resisted all such ideas with considerable success and with the whole force of their emotions. Of course, it is partly a matter of temperament and partly a matter of language, and perhaps a dislike and fear of the mathematical concepts of the engineer may have had something to do with the matter. Too often biologists simply cannot bring themselves to make a sufficiently serious study of the structural aspects of their problems. Yet there can be no reason to assume that,, while Nature uses methods of infinite subtlety in her chemistry and her control mechanisms, her structural approach should be a crude one.

生物的结构

生物学结构的出现远早于人工结构。在生命出现之前，世界上不存在任何形式的目的性结构，只有山岳和成堆的沙石。即使是非常简单、原始的生命形态，也形成了一种微妙的平衡，其化学反应自发产生且不断延续，你要将其与非生命体分隔开，并防止其受到侵害。大自然创造了生命，并让其自生自灭，所以有必要设计出某种容器以使之存续。这样的薄层或薄膜至少要具备最低限度的机械强度，且要容纳生命物质，还要保护其免遭外力的侵袭。

在可能的条件下，某些最早的生命形态是由在水中游荡的微滴构成的，那么一个非常脆弱且简单的屏障，或许仅仅靠不同液体间界面上存在的表面张力，就已经够用了。渐渐地，随着生物形态日趋繁复，生命的竞争越发激烈，弱小、无法自主运动的球状生物将会处于不利的地位。生物的表皮变得越来越坚韧，各种各样的运动形式层出不穷。更大的多细胞动物出现了，它们会撕咬，并快速游动。生存的要义变成了追逐与被追逐，吃与被吃。亚里士多德称之为「allelophagia」，即相互吞噬，达尔文则称之为自然选择。不管怎样，进化的历程取决于更强生物材料和更精妙活体结构的发展。

早期更原始的动物大多是由软材料构成的，不仅因为这样的材料能使之更易扭动且能任意延展自身，还因为这些软组织通常是坚韧的（正如我们将要看到的），而像骨骼这样的刚性结构却往往是脆弱的。此外，刚性材料的运用会给生长和繁殖带来各种各样的麻烦。女士们都知道，生产是一项涉及高应变和大挠度的大工程。尽管如此，但脊椎动物从受精卵发育到胎儿的过程，就像普遍的天然结构一样，在某些方面是从软变硬的过程，而且在婴儿出生后，这个硬化过程仍在持续。

这给人的感觉像是大自然很不情愿地接受了强劲的材料，然而当动物越来越大时，它们从水中登上陆地，大多数长出且用上了刚性的骨架和牙齿，有些还有硬角和甲壳。但是，动物绝对不会变成像大部分现代机械那样以刚性装置为主导。骨骼通常只占全身的一小部分，下面我们将会看到，那些软的部分常常巧妙地减轻了骨骼上的负荷，使之免受折断之苦。

大多数动物的躯体主要是由柔性材料构成的，而植物则并不总是如此。那些更小且更原始的植物通常是软的，所以植物既不能追捕其食物，也没法躲避其天敌。然而在某种程度上，它可以通过长高来自保，并争夺更多的阳光雨露。尤其是树木，它们十分巧妙地伸展，既能收集散布在空中的若隐若现的阳光，又能挺立直面狂风的威胁，当然，是以最节能的方式。最高的树能长到约 110 米，这是迄今最大且最结实的活体结构。然而，一株植物即使只长到上述高度的 1/10，其主体结构也需轻巧又有刚性，我们将在后文看到这为工程师提供了许多重要的经验。

很明显，像这样关于强度、柔度和韧度的问题遍布医学和动植物学等领域，然而长期以来，医生和生物学家都排斥这些观念，他们仰仗的是在这些领域的巨大成就和专业自尊。当然，这一方面关乎性格，另一方面关乎语言，或许工程师对数学概念的厌恶和畏惧也与此有关。在绝大多数情况下，从结构的角度研究动植物，确实是生物学家无法胜任的工作。但是我们也没有道理假定大自然在其化学与控制机制上精雕细琢，而在结构上却粗制滥造。

## 1.2 The technological structure

Wonders there are many, but there is no wonder

Wilder than man –

Man who makes the winds of winter bear him,

Through the trough of waves that tower about him,

Across grey wastes of sea;

Man who wearies the Untiring, the Immortal–

Earth, eldest of the Gods, as year by year,

His plough teams come and go.

The care-free bands of birds,

Beasts of the wild, tribes of the sea.

In netted toils he takes.

The Subtle One.

Sophocles, Antigone (440 B.C.; translated by F. L. Lucas)

Benjamin Franklin (1706–90) used to define man as 'a tool-making animal'. In fact a good many other animals make and use rather primitive tools, and of course they quite often make better houses than do many uncivilized men. It might not be very easy to point out the exact moment in the development of man at which his technology could be said noticeably to surpass that of the beasts that perish. Perhaps it was later than we think, especially if the early men were arboreal.

However this may be, the gap both in time and in technical achievement between the sticks and stones of the earliest men – which were not much better than the tools used by the higher animals – and the sophisticated and beautiful artefacts of the late Stone Age is an immense one. Pre-metallic cultures have survived in remote places until only yesterday and many of their devices can be seen and admired in museums. To make strong structures without the benefit of metals requires an instinct for the distribution and direction of stresses which is by no means always possessed by modern engineers; for the use of metals, which are so conveniently tough and uniform, has taken some of the intuition and also some of the thinking out of engineering. Since the invention of Fibreglass and other artificial composite materials we have been returning at times to the sort of fibrous non-metallic structures which were developed by the Polynesians and the Eskimoes. As a result we have become more aware of our own inadequacies in visualizing stress systems and, just possibly, more respectful of primitive technologies.

As a matter of fact the introduction of the technological metals to the civilized world – probably between 2,000 and 1,000 B.C. – did not make a very large or immediate difference to most artificial structures, because metals were scarce, expensive and not very easy to shape. The use of metals for cutting tools and weapons and, to some extent, for armour had its effect, but the majority of load-bearing artefacts continued to be made from masonry and from timber and leather and rope and textiles.

Using the old mixed constructions, the millwright and the coachbuilder, the shipwright and the rigger, needed a very high degree of skill, though of course they had their blind spots and they made the sort of mistakes one might expect from men without a formal analytical training. On the whole, the introduction of steam and machinery resulted in a dilution of skills, and it also limited the range of materials in general use in 'advanced technology' to a few standardized, rigid substances such as steel and concrete.

The pressures in some of the early engines were not much higher than our blood-pressure but, since materials like leather are incapable of withstanding hot steam, the engineer could not contrive a steam engine out of bladders and membranes and flexible tubes. So he was compelled to evolve from metals, by mechanical means, movements which an animal might have achieved more simply and perhaps with less weight.* He had to get his effects by means of wheels, springs, connecting rods and pistons sliding in cylinders.

Although these rather clumsy devices were originally imposed on him by the limitations of his materials, the engineer has come to look on this kind of approach to technology as the only proper and respectable one. Once he has settled in his rut of metal cogwheels and girders the engineer takes a lot of shifting. Moreover this attitude to materials and technology has rubbed off on the general public. Not long ago, at a cocktail party, the pretty wife of an American scientist said to me 'So you're really telling me that people used to make airplanes out of wood! – out of lumber \ I don't believe you, you're kidding me.'

To what extent this outlook is objectively justified and how far it is based on prejudice and a morbid passion for being up to date is one of the questions which we shall discuss in this book. We need to take a balanced view. The traditional range of engineering structures made from bricks and stone and concrete and from steel and aluminium have been very successful, and clearly we ought to take them seriously, both for their own sakes and for what they have to teach us in a broader context. We might remember, however, that the pneumatic tyre, for instance, has changed the face of land transport and is probably a more important invention than the internal combustion engine. Yet we do not often teach engineering students about tyres, and there has been a distinct tendency in the schools of engineering to sweep the whole business of flexible structures under the carpet. When we come to look at the question in a broad way we may perhaps find that, for solid quantitative reasons, there is a case for trying to rebuild some part of traditional engineering upon models which may well turn out to be partly biological in inspiration.

Whatever view we may take of these matters we cannot get away from the fact that every branch of technology must be concerned, to a greater or less extent, with questions of strength and deflections; and we may consider ourselves lucky if our mistakes in these directions are merely annoying or expensive and do not kill or injure somebody. Those concerned with electrical affairs might be reminded that a great proportion of the failures in electrical and electronic devices are mechanical in origin.

Structures can, and do, break, and this may be important and sometimes dramatic; but, in conventional technology, the rigidity and deflections of a structure before it breaks are likely to be more important in practice. A house, a floor or a table which wobbled or swayed would not be acceptable, and we should consider that the performance of, say, an optical device such as a microscope or a camera depends not only upon the quality of its lenses but also upon the accuracy and rigidity with which they are positioned. Faults of this kind are far too common.

工艺结构

世上奇迹虽多，若论神奇

难比于人 ——

他迎着凛冬寒风，

穿过滔天巨浪，

横渡沧溟茫茫；

连不倦不朽之大地，这最古老的神灵，

亦厌倦他，年复一年，

来来去去，耕耘不辍。

逍遥自在者，飞鸟，

走兽，游鱼，

尽入其网，

败于他的狡黠。

—— 索福克勒斯（Sophocles），《安提戈涅》（Antigone）

本杰明·富兰克林曾把人定义为「一种会制造工具的动物」。事实上，好多其他动物也会制造并使用相当原始的工具，它们筑巢的本事甚至常常超过未开化的人。要指明人类走出洪荒的确切时刻绝非易事，彼时人类的技艺可以说完胜那些沦为食物的野兽。考虑到早期人类可能栖息于树上这个事实，或许，它比我们想象的要晚。

然而，人类从最早期的棍棒和石块（并不比高等动物使用的工具好多少）到石器时代晚期成熟精美的手工制品，跨越了一条巨大的鸿沟。金属工具时代之前的文明在化外之地存续已久，许多器物就陈列在博物馆里。不借助金属材料就制作出坚固的结构，需要一种把握应力分布和方向的天赋，这是现代工程师未必具备的；金属自有坚韧且均质之便，就其运用而言，既有直觉上的考量，也有工程之外的思索。自玻璃纤维等人工复合材料问世以来，我们间或回归波利尼西亚人和因纽特人开发出的那种含纤维的非金属结构。故而，我们越发意识到自身在运用应力体系方面的不足，也因此更加敬重原始工艺。

事实上，金属工艺进入人类文明 —— 大致在公元前 2000 年到公元前 1000 年间 —— 对大部分人工结构来说，并没有带来特别巨大或直接的不同，原因在于金属既稀缺又昂贵，且不易成形。在切削工具、武器以及甲胄上局部使用金属自有其效果，但大多数承担负载的人工制品仍是由砖石、木材、皮革、绳索和纺织物构成的。

2『金属工艺进入人类文明的时间节点，做一张信息数据卡片。（2021-06-19）』—— 已完成

建磨坊的、造车的、造船的以及搞装配的工匠在使用这些旧式的混合构造时，需要具备高超的技能，但他们有各自的弱势，也会因缺乏正规理论训练而犯错。总而言之，蒸汽与机械的引入导致了手工技能的弱化，也使应用于「先进工艺」的材料范围局限于少数标准化的刚性材质，譬如钢材和混凝土。

虽然某些早期发动机的缸压并不比我们的血压高多少，但像皮革这样的材料无法承受灼热的蒸汽，工程师没法用皮囊、皮膜和软管制作出一台蒸汽发动机。因此，他们只能用金属，并借助机械手段实现。要是让动物来做同样的事，它们的办法可能更简单，耗材或许更轻。[1] 而工程师则不得不依靠轮子、弹簧、连杆和气缸中滑动的活塞来达成目标。

虽然这些笨重的装置最初是受材料所限而不得已用之，但工程师已逐渐把这种技术视作正当且体面的方法。在习惯使用金属齿轮和主梁后，工程师玩出了新花样。此外，这种对材料和技术的态度已经散播到普通人中间去了。不久前，在一场鸡尾酒会上，一位美国科学家的美丽妻子对我说：「你是说人们过去是用木材造飞机的吗？就用破木头！我不信，你就胡扯吧。」

我们应如何客观评价这些结构，它们又在多大程度上是基于偏见和赶时髦的心血来潮，这是本书探讨的问题之一。我们需要保持一种均衡的观点。工程结构的传统选材范围遍及砖石混凝土、钢材和铝材，已经非常成功，我们显然不可等闲视之，既因为这些材料本身的作用，也因为我们从中获益良多。然而，我们或许记得，充气轮胎改变了陆上运输的面貌，这可能是比内燃机更重要的发明。但我们一般不怎么给工科生讲授轮胎的相关知识，工科学校有一个明显的倾向，即对柔性结构一概讳莫如深。当我们更宽泛地看待这个问题时，或许可以发现，出于定量的考虑，我们可以试着重构传统工程学的某些部分，将其建立在仿生学模型的基础上。

无论我们持何种观点，都无法回避这样的事实：工程技术的每个分支都必须或多或少地关注强度和挠度的问题。而且，如果我们在这些问题上犯错带来的仅仅是恼人的烦琐程序或高昂的花费，而非人员伤亡的后果，我们已经相当走运了。那些从事与电子相关工作的人可能会被提醒，大部分电气与电子设备的故障都是由机械故障引发的。

结构能够被破坏，也确实会遭到破坏，这可能很重要，有时也颇富戏剧性；但是，在传统的工程技术中，一个结构在破坏前的刚度和挠度在实践过程中可能更为重要。摇摇晃晃的房子、地板和桌子难遂人意，我们应该意识到光学设备，比如显微镜或照相机，其性能不仅取决于镜头的品质，还依赖于其架设位置的精度和刚度。而这类失误比比皆是。

## 1.3 Structures and aesthetics

Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,

I would speak my heart out: heaven is my need.

Every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood,

Flashing like the whitebeam, swaying like the reed.

Flushing like the dogwood crimson in October;

Streaming like the flag-reed South-West blown;

Flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted whitebeam:

All seem to know what is for heaven alone.

George Meredith, Love in the Valley

Nowadays, whether we like it or not, we are stuck with one form or another of advanced technology and we have got to make it work safely and efficiently: this involves, among other things, the intelligent application of structural theory. However, man does not live by safety and efficiency alone, and we have to face the fact that, visually, the world is becoming an increasingly depressing place. It is not, perhaps, so much the occurrence of what might be described as 'active ugliness' as the prevalence of the dull and the commonplace. Far too seldom is the heart rejoiced or does one feel any better or happier for looking at the works of modern man.

Yet most of the artefacts of the eighteenth century, even quite humble and trivial ones, seem to many of us to be at least pleasing and sometimes incomparably beautiful. To that extent people – all people – in the eighteenth century lived richer lives than most of us do today. This is reflected in the prices we pay nowadays for period houses and antiques. A society which was more creative and self-confident would not feel quite so strong a nostalgia for its great-grandfathers' buildings and household goods.

Although such a book as this is not the place in which to develop elaborate and perhaps controversial theories of applied art, the question cannot be wholly ignored. As we have said, nearly every artefact is in some sense a structure of one kind or another, and, although most artefacts are not primarily concerned with making an emotional or aesthetic effect, it is highly important to realize that there can be no such thing as an emotionally neutral statement. This is true whether the medium be speech or writing or painting or technological design. Whether we mean it or not, every single thing we design and make will have some kind of subjective impact, for good or bad, over and above its overt rational purpose.

I think we are up against yet another problem of communication. Most engineers have had no aesthetic training at all, and the tendency in the schools of engineering is to despise such matters as frivolous. In any case, there is little enough time in the crowded syllabuses. Modern architects have made it very clear to me that they cannot spare time from their lordly sociological objectives to consider such minor matters as the strength of their buildings; nor, indeed, can they spare much time for aesthetics, in which their clients are probably not much interested anyway. Again, furniture designers, incredibly, are not taught during their formal training how to calculate the deflection in an ordinary bookshelf when it is loaded with books, and so it is not very surprising that most of them seem to have no ideas about relating the appearance to the structure of their products.

结构与审美

如今，我们往往一边受制于某种先进工艺，一边还得保证其安全有效：这就需要我们高明地应用结构理论。然而，人并非仅仅依赖安全和效率为生，我们还得面对这样一个事实：这世界看似变得越发令人沮丧了。这与其说是「自找的丑」，不如说是平庸乏味的盛行。现代人的作品罕有令人赏心悦目者。

然而，大部分 18 世纪的人工制品，哪怕是那些相当不起眼的，在我们很多人看来，至少是令人愉悦的，有的甚至堪称精美绝伦。就此而论，那些活在 18 世纪的人 —— 所有人 —— 过得比我们今天的大部分人都要丰富多彩。我们如今在老宅和古董上的花销就反映了这一点。一个更具创造力和自信心的社会不会对太爷爷辈的屋子和家当抱有那么强烈的怀旧之情。

虽然本书并不打算阐述繁复甚至有争议的实用艺术理论，但这个问题却不能置之不理。正如我们已经提到的，几乎每一件人工制品在一定意义上都包含这种或那种结构，尽管大部分人工制品并非为了满足情感的需要或达到审美的效果，但我们务必意识到，世上没有无情的表达。演说、写作、绘画，或者工业设计概莫能外。不管有心还是无意，我们设计制造的每一件东西都带有某些个人色彩，无论好坏，都超越了表面上的理性初衷。

我认为我们还面临着另一个问题 —— 沟通。大部分工程师完全没有接受过审美训练，工科学校倾向于鄙夷这类浮华之事。此外，满满当当的教学大纲中已挤不出空间给审美。现代建筑师已经说得非常清楚，他们不会从自己高雅的社会性任务中挤出时间来考虑建筑强度之类的琐事；实际上，他们也不会把太多时间花在审美上，况且他们的客户大概也不怎么感兴趣。同样令人难以置信的是，家具设计师在接受的正规训练中也没有学习过如何计算书放在普通书架上产生的挠度，所以大多数设计师似乎完全不懂如何把产品外观同其结构联系起来，也就没什么可奇怪的了。

## 1.4 The theory of elasticity, or why things do fall down

Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?

Luke 13.4

Many people – especially English people – dislike theory, and usually they do not think very much of theoreticians. This seems to apply especially to questions of strength and elasticity. A really surprising number of people who would not venture into the fields of, say, chemistry or medicine feel themselves competent to produce a structure upon which someone's life may depend. If pressed, they might admit that a large bridge or an aeroplane was a little beyond them, but the common structures of life surely present only the most trivial of problems?

This is not to suggest that the construction of an ordinary shed is a matter calling for years of study; yet it is true that the whole subject is littered with traps for the unwary, and many things are not as simple as they might seem. Too often the engineers are only called in, professionally, to deal with the structural achievements of 'practical' men at the same time as the lawyers and the undertakers.

Nevertheless, for long centuries the practical men managed after their own fashion – at least in certain fields of construction. If you go and look at a cathedral you may well wonder whether you are impressed more deeply by the skill or by the faith of the people who built it. These buildings are not only of very great size and height; some of them seem to transcend the dull and heavy nature of their constructional materials and to soar upwards into art and poetry.

On the face of it it would seem obvious that the medieval masons knew a great deal about how to build churches and cathedrals, and of course they were often highly successful and superbly good at it. However, if you had had the chance to ask the Master Mason how it was really done and why the thing stood up at all, I think he might have said something like 'The building is kept up by the hand of God – always provided that, when we built it, we duly followed the traditional rules and mysteries of our craft.'

Naturally, the buildings we see and admire are those which have survived: in spite of their 'mysteries' and their skill and experience, the medieval masons were by no means always successful. A fair proportion of their more ambitious efforts fell down soon after they were built, or sometimes during construction. However, these catastrophes were just as likely to be regarded as sent from Heaven, to punish the unrighteous or to bring sinners to repentance, as to be the consequence of mere technical ignorance – hence the need for the remark about the tower of Siloam.*

Perhaps because they were too much obsessed by the moral significance of good workmanship, the old builders and carpenters and shipwrights never seem to nave thought at all, in any scientific sense, about why a structure is able to carry a load. Professor Jacques Heyman has shown conclusively that the cathedral masons, at any rate, did not think or design in the modern way. Although some of the achievements of the medieval craftsmen are impressive, the intellectual basis of their 'rules' and 'mysteries' was not very different from that of a cookery book. What these people did was to make something very much like what had been made before.

As we shall see in Chapter 9, masonry is a rather exceptional case and there are some special reasons why it is sometimes safe and practicable to scale up from small churches to large cathedrals, relying simply on experience and traditional proportions. For other kinds of structures this way of doing things will not work and is quite unsafe. This is the reason why, though buildings got bigger and bigger, for a very long time the size of the largest ships remained virtually constant. So long as there was no scientific way of predicting the safety of technological structures, attempts to make devices which were new or radically different were only too likely to end in disaster.

Thus, for generation after generation, men turned their heads away from a rational approach to problems of strength. However, if you make a habit of shelving questions which, in your secret heart, you must surely know to be important, the psychological consequences will be unhappy. What happened was just what one would have expected. The whole subject became a breeding-ground for cruelty and superstition. When a ship is christened by some noble matron with a bottle of champagne, or when a foundation stone is laid by a fat mayor, these ceremonies are the last vestiges of certain very nasty sacrificial rites.

During the course of the Middle Ages the Church managed to suppress most of the sacrifices, but it did not do much to encourage any kind of scientific approach. To escape completely from such attitudes – or to accept that God may work through the agency of the laws of science – requires a complete change of thinking, a mental effort such as we can scarcely comprehend today. It called for a quite exceptional combination of imagination with intellectual discipline at a time when the very vocabulary of science barely existed.

As it turned out, the old craftsmen never accepted the challenge, and it is interesting to reflect that the effective beginnings of the serious study of structures may be said to be due to the persecution and obscurantism of the Inquisition. In 1633, Galileo (1564–1642) fell foul of the Church on account of his revolutionary astronomical discoveries, which were considered to threaten the very bases of religious and civil authority. He was most firmly headed off astronomy and, after his famous recantation,* he was perhaps lucky to be allowed to retire to his villa at Arcetri, near Florence. Living there, virtually under house-arrest, he took up the study of the strength of materials as being, I suppose, the safest and least subversive subject he could think of.

As it happened, Galileo's own contribution to our knowledge of the strength of materials was only moderately distinguished, though one must bear in mind that he was almost seventy when he began to work on the subject, that he had been through a great deal and that he was still more or less a prisoner. However, he was allowed to correspond with scholars in various parts of Europe, and his great reputation lent prestige and publicity to any subject he took up.

Among his many surviving letters there are several about structures, and his correspondence with Mersenne, who worked in France, seems to have been particularly fruitful. Marin Mersenne (1588–1648) was a Jesuit priest, but presumably nobody could object to his researches on the strength of metal wires. Edmé Mariotte (1620–84), a much younger man, was also a priest, being Prior of Saint Martin-sous-Beaune, near Dijon, in the wine country. He spent most of his life working on the laws of terrestrial mechanics and on the strength of rods in tension and in bending. Under Louis XIV he helped to found the French Academy of Sciences and was in favour with both Church and State. None of these people, it will be noted, were professional builders or shipwrights.

By Mariotte's time the whole subject of the behaviour of materials and structures under loads was beginning to be called the science of elasticity – for reasons which will become apparent in the next chapter – and we shall use this name repeatedly throughout this book. Since the subject became popular with mathematicians about 150 years ago I am afraid that a really formidable number of unreadable, incomprehensible books have been written about elasticity, and generations of students have endured agonies of boredom in lectures about materials and structures. In my opinion the mystique and mumbo-jumbo is overdone and often beside the point. It is true that the higher flights of elasticity are mathematical and very difficult – but then this sort of theory is probably only rarely used by successful engineering designers. What is actually needed for a great many ordinary purposes can be understood quite easily by any intelligent person who will give his or her mind to the matter.

The man in the street, or the man in the workshop, thinks he needs virtually no theoretical knowledge. The engineering don is apt to pretend that to get anywhere worth while without the higher mathematics is not only impossible but that it would be vaguely immoral if you could. It seems to me that ordinary mortals like you and me can get along surprisingly well with some intermediate – and I hope more interesting – state of knowledge.

All the same, we cannot wholly evade the question of mathematics, which is said to have originated in Babylonia – possibly at the time of the Tower of Babel incident. Mathematics is to the scientist and the engineer a tool, to the professional mathematician a religion, but to the ordinary person a stumbling-block. Yet all of us are really using mathematics through every moment of our lives. When we play tennis or walk downstairs we are actually solving whole pages of differential equations, quickly, easily and without thinking about it, using the analogue computer which we keep in our minds. What we find difficult about mathematics is the formal, symbolic presentation of the subject by pedagogues with a taste for dogma, sadism and incomprehensible squiggles.

For the most part, wherever a 'mathematical' argument is really needed I shall try to use graphs and diagrams of the simplest kind. We shall, however, need some arithmetic and a little very, very elementary algebra, which – however rude we may be to the mathematicians – is, after all, a simple, powerful and convenient mode of thought. Even if you are born, or think you are born, with an allergy to algebra, please do not be frightened of it. However, if you really must skip it, it will still be possible to follow the arguments in this book in a qualitative way without losing too much of the story.

One further point: structures are made from materials and we shall talk about structures and also about materials; but in fact there is no clear-cut dividing line between a material and a structure. Steel is undoubtedly a material and the Forth bridge is undoubtedly a structure, but reinforced concrete and wood and human flesh – all of which have a rather complicated constitution – may be considered as either materials or structures. I am afraid that, like Humpty-Dumpty, when we use the word 'material' in this book, it will mean whatever we want it to mean. That this is not always the same as what other people mean by 'material' was brought home to me by another lady at another cocktail party.

'Do tell me what it is you do?'

'I'm a professor of materials.'

'What fun it must be to handle all those dress-fabrics!'

2 There is an interesting discussion of pagan views on this subject in Gilbert Murray's Five Stages of Greek Religion (O.U.P., 1930). Again, the whole question of animism in connection with structures is worthy of study.

高楼为什么会倒塌

西罗亚楼倒塌了，死了十八个人，你们以为他们的罪孽深过住在耶路撒冷的所有人吗？

——《圣经·新约全书·路加福音》（Luke 13:4）

许多人 —— 尤其是英格兰人 —— 厌恶理论，他们一般不怎么看得起理论家。这似乎特别适用于强度和弹性问题。相当一部分人不敢涉足化学或医学领域，却自认为有能力制造出一个关乎人命的结构。如果施加一些压力，他们可能会承认造一座大桥或一架飞机有点儿超出他们的能力范围，然而，那些关乎人命的普通结构真的就谁都能造出来吗？

这不是说搭一座寻常的棚子也是一件需经年累月研究的要事；然而，整个学科确实遍布着稍不留神就会掉入的陷阱，许多事情也不像看上去那么简单。在绝大多数情况下，工程师只是同律师和送葬者一道出现，专门应付属于「实干家」的结构事务。

然而，数个世纪以来，实干家都在按自己的套路行事，至少在某些制造领域是这样。如果你游览一座主教座堂（cathedral），就难免会问：建造者的技巧或信念，哪一个给你的印象更深？这些建筑不仅仅在体量上堪称宏伟，某些似乎还超越了其构造材质的沉闷笨重，升华到了艺术与诗性的境界。

从表面上看，中世纪的石匠显然对如何建造教堂和主教座堂了如指掌，当然他们往往成就斐然且精于此道。然而，如果你有机会向一位石匠大师讨教此中的细节和原理，我想他可能会这么说：「建筑的屹立有赖于无处不在的上帝之手，当我们建造它时，我们恪守传统的规矩与我们技艺的奥秘。」

然而，我们看见和欣赏的是那些存世的建筑：虽然身负「奥秘」、技巧和经验，但中世纪的石匠也不总是成功的。在他们更具野心的尝试中，很大一部分在建成后不久便坍塌了，有的甚至在施工期间便倒下了。但是，这些灾难多半被视为天谴，是为了惩罚罪恶，而不是纯粹由技术上的无知造成的后果。因此，我们有必要谈谈西罗亚楼。[2]

或许，因为太沉迷于好手艺的道德意义，旧时代的建筑师、木匠和造船工似乎未曾从科学角度思考过一个结构为何能够承载一定的负荷。雅克·海曼（Jacques Heyman）教授曾明确指出，造主教座堂的石匠，无论如何也不会以现代的方式思考或设计。虽然中世纪工匠的一些成就令人印象深刻，但他们那些「规矩」和「奥秘」的智力水准可能和一本烹饪手册没多大区别。这些人所做的事情基本上就是沿袭以前的工作。

我们将在第 9 章看到，砖石构造是一种特例，仅依靠经验和传统比例将小教堂扩建为大型主教座堂有时之所以安全可行，是有其特殊原因的。而对其他类型的结构而言，这么做则行不通，甚至相当危险。这就是为何虽然建筑物越来越大，但在相当长时间里大型船舶的尺寸几乎保持不变。没有科学的方法来预测工程结构的安全性，尝试制造全新或截然不同的装置只能以灾难告终。

1-2『这里的主题是「工程放大」，中世纪的建筑是「砖石结构」，而砖石结构是一种「特例」，中世纪的砖石建筑之所以被放大建造而不塌，靠的是砖石结构的特殊性，运气使然。砖石结构的特殊性，直觉上很重要，先做一张主题卡片，等研读第九章的时候再补充信息。（2021-06-19）』

因此，一代又一代人逐渐不再用理性的思维解决强度的难题。然而，如果你总是在内心深处搁置自认为很重要的问题，那么你在心理上一定不舒服，你害怕的事往往会发生。这个难题变成了滋生残忍和迷信的温床。当某位达官贵人为新船下水开香槟酒，或者一位大腹便便的市镇长官为建筑开工奠基时，这些仪式典礼正是某些残忍献祭的最后残余。

中世纪，天主教会查禁了大多数献祭仪式，但这对鼓励科学方法的使用并没有多大帮助。为了完全摆脱此类做法，或者为了承认上帝可以借助科学规律的力量来行事，需要一次彻底的思想转变，一种我们今天难以体会的精神蜕变。当科学术语几乎不存在时，就需要将想象力与知识素养别出心裁地结合在一起。

结果表明，旧时代的工匠从未在这方面做出过努力。有趣的是，关于结构的严肃研究的真正开端，可追溯至宗教裁判所的迫害和愚民政策。1633 年，伽利略（1564-1642）因其革命性的天文发现而触怒天主教会，他的工作被认为威胁了宗教神权和世俗政权的基础。教会严禁他涉足天文学研究，在众所周知的改邪归正之后，[3] 他幸运地获准退隐于佛罗伦萨附近的阿切特里。名义上蛰居家中，实质上被软禁的他开始研究材料强度，我猜想这是他可以想到的最安全且颠覆性最小的课题了。

就有关材料强度的知识而言，伽利略的贡献仅算略有创新，但你务必牢记他开始研究该课题时已年近七旬，饱经风霜且形同囚徒。然而，他获准同欧洲各地的学者通信，而他的显赫声名为其从事的所有研究都赋予了权威性和知名度。

在他存世的许多信件中，有几封是关于结构的，其中他与法国的马林·梅森（Marin Mersenne）的通信似乎尤为成果显著。马林·梅森是一位耶稣会神父，但想必无人会否认他在金属丝强度方面的研究。埃德梅·马略特（Edmé Mariotte）更年轻，也是一位神父，是第戎附近的葡萄酒之乡圣马丁苏博讷的修道院院长。他用了大半辈子的时间来研究地质力学的规律，以及杆在拉伸和弯曲状态下的强度。在路易十四治下，他促成了法兰西科学院的创立，博得了天主教会和世俗政权的欢心。值得注意的是，这些人里没有一个是专职的建筑或造船工匠。

到了马略特的时代，研究材料和结构负载行为这门学问开始被称为弹性科学（原因将在下一章中揭示），我会在本书中反复使用这个名词。大概自 150 年前这门学科得到数学家的重视后，有关弹性的枯燥晦涩的著作犹如汗牛充栋，一代代学生在有关材料和结构的讲授中深受无聊的摧残。以我之见，故作高深与故弄玄虚实无必要，而且往往离题万里。固然，有关弹性的深层次研究一定与数学有关，也非常艰深，但这类理论可能只是偶尔被成功的工程设计人员采用。许多寻常用途实际所需的学问，很容易被任何有心的聪明人理解。

街上的路人或车间里的工人认为他们几乎不需要理论知识。工科教员倾向于宣称，想要有所收获，不借助高等数学是办不到的，即使办得到，也不过是旁门左道。在我看来，像你我这样的凡夫俗子跟某些介于中间的 —— 我希望是更有趣的 —— 知识异常投缘。

尽管如此，我们也不能完全回避数学问题，据说它起源于古巴比伦，也许就是建造巴别塔的时代。对科学家和工程师而言，数学是一种工具；对数学家而言，数学是一门宗教；但对普罗大众来说，数学则是一块绊脚石。事实上，所有人在生活中的每时每刻都离不开数学。当我们打网球或下楼时，我们实际上在解整页的微分方程，我们的计算迅速、从容且不假思索，借助的是大脑里的模拟计算机。由于偏爱教条、施虐和鬼画桃符的好为人师者对这门学科形式化、符号化的表述，数学变得艰深晦涩。

在大部分情况下，在任何真正需要用数学方法论证的地方，我都会尽量使用最简单的示意图表。但是，我们应该也会用到一些算术和一点儿初等的代数，这毕竟是一种简单、强大且方便的思维模式，这样说可能对数学家有些无礼。纵然你以为自己天生搞不懂代数问题，也请不要畏惧它。可是，若你执意略过它，你仍可以从本质上读懂本书，而不至于错过太多细节。

还有一点要注意：结构是由材料构成的，我们既会谈结构，也会聊材料；但事实上，材料和结构之间并没有明确的分界线。钢无疑是一种材料，福斯铁路桥无疑是一个结构，但钢筋混凝土、木材和人类肌体 —— 所有这些东西都具有相当复杂的构成 —— 既可被视为材料，也可被看作结构。就像蛋头先生（Humpty-Dumpty）[4] 那样，本书中使用的「材料」一词，指代了我们想用它指代的任何东西。它与其他人所谓的「材料」并不总是同义，这一点还是某次鸡尾酒会上一位女士给了我启发。
