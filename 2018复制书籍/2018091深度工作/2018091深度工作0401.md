“In my retiring room…” and “I keep the key…” and “The feeling of repose and renewal…”: Jung, Carl. Memories, Dreams, Reflections. Trans. Richard Winston. New York: Pantheon, 1963.

“Although he had many patients…” and other information on artists’ habits: Currey, Mason. Daily Rituals: How Artists Work. New York: Knopf, 2013.

The following timeline of Jung’s life and work also proved useful in untangling the role of deep work in his career: Cowgill, Charles. “Carl Jung.”May 1997. http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/jung.htm

For more on deliberate practice, the following two books provide a good popular overview:

· Colvin, Geoffrey. Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else. New York: Portfolio, 2008.

· Coyle, Daniel. The Talent Code: Greatness Isn’t Born. It’s Grown. Here’s How. New York: Bantam, 2009.

Anders Ericsson from Florida State University is a leading academic researcher on the concept of deliberate practice. He has a nice description of the idea on his academic website: http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson/ericsson.exp.perf.html

My list of the deep work habits of important personalities draws from the following sources:

· Montaigne information comes from: Bakewell, Sarah. How to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer. New York: Other Press, 2010.

· Mark Twain information comes from: Mason Currey’s Daily Rituals (see above).

· Woody Allen information comes from Robert Weide’s 2011 documentary, Woody Allen: A Documentary.

· Peter Higgs information comes from: http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/08/nobel-laureate-peter-higgs-boson-elusive

· J.K. Rowling information comes from: https://twitter.com/jk_rowling

· Bill Gates information comes from: http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB111196625830690477

· Neal Stephenson information comes from an older version of Stephenson’s website which has been preserved in a December, 2003 snapshot by The Internet Archive: http://web. archive.org/web/20031207060405/ http://www.well.com/~neal/badcorrespondent.html

“What the Net seems to be doing is…” and “I’m not the only one”: Carr, Nicholas.“Is Google Making Us Stupid?” The Atlantic Monthly, July/August 2008. Also online at: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/

The fact that Carr had to move to a cabin to finish writing The Shallows comes from the Author’s Note in the paperback version of the book.

Grant’s claim that he tries to stack his three annual courses into a single semester (usually the fall) is hard to independently verify without access to the University of Pennsylvania course system. I was able to verify, however, that during the spring of 2014, when I wrote this chapter, the official University web site reported“no courses currently offered”under teaching on Grant’s site.

The h-index for an academic is (roughly speaking) the largest value x that satisfies the following rule:“I have published at least x papers with x or more citations.”Notice, this value manages to capture both how many papers you have written and how often you are cited. You cannot gain a high h-index value simply by pumping out a lot of low value papers, or by having a small number of papers that are cited often. This metric tends to grow over careers, which is why in many fields h-index goals are tied to certain career milestones.

Alissa Rubin tweets at @Alissanyt. I don’t have specific evidence that Alissa Rubin was pressured to tweet. But I can make a circumstantial case: she includes“nyt”in her Twitter handle, and The Times maintains a Social Media Desk that helps educate its employees about how to use social media (c.f., https://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/new-york-times-social-media-desk_ b53783), a focus that has led to over 600 employees tweeting: https://twitter.com/nytimes/nyt-journalists/members

The Attention Restoration Therapy study described in the text: Berman, Marc G., John Jonides, and Stephen Kaplan.“The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting with Nature.”Psychological Science 19.12 (2008): 1207-1212.

I called this study“frequently cited”based on the over 400 citations identified by Google Scholar as of November, 2014.

The general information about Theodore Roosevelt’s Harvard habits comes from Edmund Morris’fantastic biography: Morris, Edmund. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. New York: The Modern Library Edition, Random House, 2001. In particular, pages 61 – 65 includes Morris’catalog of Roosevelt’s collegiate activities and an excerpt from a letter from Roosevelt to his mother that outlines his work habits. The specific calculation that Roosevelt dedicates a quarter of his typical day to schoolwork comes from page 64.

“amazing array of interests…”: from page 64 of Morris (2001).

The positive receipt of Roosevelt’s book by the Nuttall Bulletin comes from Morris’s end notes: in particular, Note 37 in the chapter titled,“The Man with the Morning in his Face.”

“one of the most knowledgeable…”: from page 67 of Morris (2001). I ascribed this assessment to Morris, though this is somewhat indirect, as Morris here is actually arguing that Roosevelt’s father, after the publication of The Summer of the Adirondacks, must have felt this about his son.

“the amount of time he spent at his desk…”: from page 64 of Morris (2001).

The Law of the Vital Few is discussed in many sources. Richard Koch’s 1998 book, The 80/20 Principle (New York: Crown, 1998) seems to have helped reintroduce the idea to a business market. Tim Ferriss’ 2007 mega-seller, The Four-Hour Workweek (New York: Crown, 2007), popularized it further, especially among the technology entrepreneur community. The Wikipedia page on The Pareto Principle has a good summary of various places where this general idea applies (I drew many of my examples from here): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle

Average number of Twitter follower statistic comes from: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9601327/Average-Twitter-user-is-an-an-American-woman-with-an-iPhone-and-208-followers.html.

Take this statistic with a grain of salt. A small number of Twitter users have such a large following that the average skews high. Presumably the median would be much lower. But then again, both statistics include users who signed up just to try out the service or read tweets, and who made no serious attempt to ever gain followers or write tweets. If we confined our attention to those who actually tweet and want followers, then the follower numbers would be higher.
