### 0101. 主题卡 —— npm 和 yarn 包管理

信息源自「2021060Learning-React0101.md」

用 npm 安装 yarn。

```
npm install -g yarn
```

1、初始化项目。

If you're starting your own project from scratch and want to include dependencies, simply run the command:

```
npm init -y
```

2、安装、卸载依赖包。

 To install a package with npm, you'll run:

```
npm install package-name
```

To remove a package with npm, you'll run:

```
npm remove package-name
```

To install a specific package with yarn, run:

```
yarn add package-name
```

To remove a dependency, the command is familiar, too:

```
yarn remove package-name
```

Yarn is used in production by Facebook and is included in projects like React, React Native, and Create React App. If you ever find a project that contains a yarn.lock file, the project uses yarn. Similar to the npm install command, you can install all the dependencies of the project by typing yarn.

```

```

## Preface

This book is for developers who want to learn the React library while learning the latest techniques currently emerging in the JavaScript language. This is an exciting time to be a JavaScript developer. The ecosystem is exploding with new tools, syntax, and best practices that promise to solve many of our development problems. Our aim with this book is to organize these techniques so you can get to work with React right away. We'll get into state management, React Router, testing, and server rendering, so we promise not to introduce only the basics and then throw you to the wolves.

This book does not assume any knowledge of React at all. We'll introduce all of React's basics from scratch. Similarly, we won't assume that you've worked with the latest JavaScript syntax. This will be introduced in Chapter 2 as a foundation for the rest of the chapters.

You'll be better prepared for the contents of the book if you're comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's almost always best to be comfortable with these big three before diving into a JavaScript library.

Along the way, check out the GitHub repository. All of the examples are there and will allow you to practice hands-on.

Supplemental material (code examples, exercises, etc.) is available for download at https://github.com/moonhighway/learning-react. If you have a technical question or a problem using the code examples, please send email to bookquestions@oreilly.com.
