## 0101. A Network Point of View on the World

Networks are present in the everyday life of many people. On a typical day, we check emails, update social network profiles, make mobile phone calls, use public transportation, take planes, transfer money and goods, or start new personal and professional relations…In all these cases — consciously or not — we are using networks and their properties. Similarly, networks appear in important global phenomena. Financial crises generate domino effects in the web of connections between banks and companies. Pandemics — like avian flu, SARS, or swine flu — spread in the airport network. Climate change can alter the network of relations between species in ecosystems. Terrorism and war target the infrastructure grids of a country. Large-scale blackouts take place in power grids. Computer viruses diffuse in the Internet. Governments and companies can track people’s identity through their social networks and other digital communication tools. Finally, the various applications of genetics depend on the knowledge of the genetic regulatory networks that operate within the cell.

In all these situations we deal with a large set of different elements (individuals, companies, airports, species, power stations, computers, genes …), connected through a disordered pattern of many different interactions: that is, they all have an underlying network structure. Often, this hidden network is the key to understanding those situations. A good example is the collapse of cod population in the north-western Atlantic in the eighties. At the time, the shortage of cod generated a massive economic crisis in the Canadian fishery industry. Canadian stakeholders asked for more expeditions to hunt seals, maintaining that controlling these predators of cod would help stop the collapse. Many seals were killed during the nineties, but the cod population did not recover. In the meantime, ecologists studied the different food chains that connected cod and seals. By the end of the decade, they drew a complete map ( Figure 1 ) where a lot of different chains were fou give rise to of the are notnd to connect the two species. In the light of this intricate picture, hunting for predators of cod does not necessarily help the fish. For example, seals predate about 150 species, and several of them are predators of cod: thus, reducing the population of seals can end up increasing the pressure of other predators on cod.

Ecosystems are complex webs of species: it is crucial to take into account this underlying network structure if we want to understand and manage them. Similar caution must be taken with several other systems, all based on a networked architecture. For example, the development of an infectious disease like AIDS is strongly influenced by the pattern of nonprotected sexual relations within a population. Similarly, liquidity shocks depend on the interwoven network of money exchange between banks.

All the examples above are instances of the so-called emergent phenomena . That is some collective behaviour that cannot be predicted by looking at the single elements forming the system. Usually, systems that display these phenomena are dubbed complex systems . For example, a single ant is a relatively awkward animal, but many ants together are capable of activities as complex as building large anthills or storing large quantities of food. In human societies, social order arises from the combination of autonomous individuals, often with conflicting interests, that still end up performing tasks that nobody could do on their own. Similarly, a living organism arises from the interaction of its parts; and the extraordinary resilience of the Internet to errors, attacks, and traffic peaks is a performance of the network as a whole rather than the result of the action of individual machines.

Networks, with their emphasis on the interactions, are the key to understanding many of these phenomena. Imagine two football teams whose players have very similar skills, and yet the two teams perform very differently: probably this difference depends on how good or bad the interactions are between the players on the pitch. Similarly, a single player can be good in his league team and bad in his national team because of the different positions he has with respect to the other players in the two groups. The performance of a team is a kind of emergent phenomenon, one that does depends not only on the quality of the single players or on the sum of their individual skills, but also on the network of interactions between them. Many emergent phenomena rely crucially on the structure of the underlying networks.

The network approach focuses all the attention on the global structure of the interactions within a system. The detailed properties of each element on its own are simply ignored. Consequently, systems as different as a computer network, an ecosystem, or a social group are all described by the same tool: a graph , that is, a bare architecture of nodes bounded by connections. This approach was originally developed in mathematics by Leonard Euler and later spread to a wide range of disciplines, including sociology, which has deployed it widely, and more recently physics, engineering, computer science, biology, and many others.

Representing widely different systems with the same tool can only be done by a high level of abstraction. What is lost in the specific description of the details is gained in the form of universality  — that is, thinking about very different systems as if they were different realizations of the same theoretical structure. In this respect, the spread of a computer virus can be similar to flu; hacking a router can have the same effect as the extinction of a species in an ecosystem; and the growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) can be set alongside the increase in scientific literature.

This line of reasoning provides many insights. For instance, representing a system as a graph allows us to perceive large-scale structures that encompass apparently unrelated elements. In 2003, a trivial accident in the Swiss electric grid triggered a large-scale blackout affecting Sicily, 1,000 kilometres away. Focusing on the network structure allows us to see that faraway elements end up being strongly connected, through incredibly short paths of relation or communication. The current observation that two individuals geographically and socially apart — such as a rainforest inhabitant and a manager in the City of London — are connected by only ‘six degrees of separation’ is not far from reality, and it can be explained in terms of the network structure of social relations.

The network approach also sheds light on another important feature: the fact that certain systems that grow without external control are still capable of spontaneously developing an internal order. Cells or ecosystems are not ‘designed’ but nevertheless work in a robust way. Similarly, social groups and trends arise from an immense variety of different pressures and motivations but still display clear and definite shapes. The Internet and the WWW boomed without the presence of any regulating authority and were promoted by an enormous variety of unrelated agents: however, they usually work in a coherent and efficient way. All these are self-organized processes , i.e. phenomena in which order and organization are not the result of an external intervention or global blueprint but the outcome of local mechanisms or tendencies, iterated along thousands of interactions. Network models are able to describe in a clear and natural way how self-organization arises in many systems. As well, networks allow us to better understand dynamical processes such as the rapid spread of computer viruses, the large scale of pandemics, the sudden collapse of infrastructures, and the bursts of social phobias or music trends.

In the study of complex, emergent, and self-organized systems (the modern science of complexity), networks are becoming increasingly important as a universal mathematical framework, especially when massive amounts of data are involved. This is typically the case of individuals accumulating queries in search engines, updates in social websites.

从网络的观点看世界

网络存在于许多人的日常生活之中。通常的一天里，我们都会查收电子邮件，更新社交网络上的个人资料，打移动电话，使用公共交通工具，乘坐飞机，转移货币和货物，或者开始新的私人和业务关系等等。我们在所有这些情况中 一一 有意或无意地 一一 都会涉及网络及其特性。同样地，网络也会出现在重要的全球现象中。金融危机会在银行和公司的联系网络中产生多米诺效应。流行病，比如禽流感、非典型肺炎或者猪流感，则在机场网络之间蔓延。气候化能够改变生态系統内部不同物种之间的关系网络，恐怖主义和战争则瞄准了一国之中的基础设施网络。电网内会发生大规模停电，计算机病毒在互联网中传播，政府和企业则会通过人们的社交网络和其他数字通信工具来追踪他们的身份信息。最后，遗传学的各种应用取決于人们对在细胞内部起作用的基因调控网络知识的掌握。

在所有这些情況中，我们都会处理大量不同元素（个人、公司、机场、物种、发电站、计算机、基因......）的集合，它们通过无序的多种相互作用模式而彼此关联，即它们都有着某种潜在的网络结构。通常，这种隐含的网络结构是理解前述重要现象的 1 关键所在。其中ー个很好的例子便是上世纪 80 年代大西洋西北海域鳕鱼种群的衰竭。当时，鳕鱼的短缺给加拿大水产业造成了巨大的经済危机。加拿大境内的利益相关者吁求更多地猎捕海豹，他们认为控制鳕鱼捕食者的数量有助于阻止鳕鱼种群的衰竭。大量的海豹在上世纪 90 年代遭到猎杀，但鳕鱼种群并未恢复。与此同时，生态学家们则对关联鳕鱼和海豹的不同食物链进行了研究。到上世纪 90 年代末期，他们已经为研究发现的关联这两个物种的大量不同食物链条绘制了一幅详尽的网络图（图 1）。根据这个复杂的网络图，捕杀鳕鱼捕食者并不必然有助于鳕鱼种群的恢复。比如，海豹捕食大约 150 种猎物，其中也包括鳕鱼的其他捕食者。因此海豹种群数量的减少便增加了其他鳕鱼捕食者对其种群数量所造成的压力。

生态系统乃复杂的物种网络：如果我们想要理解并管理这些物种，将这种底层的网络结构纳入考虑范围则至关重要。我们对其他一些基于网络结构的系统也必须采取类似的谨慎态度。例如，像艾滋病之类的传染病的蔓延就受到某些人群内部无保护性关系模式的强烈影响。同样，流动性冲击则取決于银行间货币交换网络的相互交织。

上述所有例子都是所谓涌现现象的例子。此种现象乃无法通过观察构成系统的单个元素而进行预测的集体行为。通常，呈现这些现象的系统被称为复杂系统。比如，单个的蚂蚁是相对笨批的昆虫，但众多蚂蚁一起则能够进行如修建蚁或者储存大量食物这样复杂的活动。而在人类社会中，社会秩序产生于自主个体的结合，尽管他们的利益往往相互沖突，但最终仍然合力执行凭一己之力无法完成的任务。类似地，某个鲜活有机体的生命力来自其不同组分的相互作用；互联网应对错误、攻击和信息量高峰的非凡弹性是网络作为整体的性能，而非单个机器运行的结果。

1『原书里这张生物链图，超级震撼。（2021-01-05）』

网络及其所强调的互动，乃理解诸多此类现象的关键。设想两支足球队的球员水准十分相近，最终表现却差异甚远。这种差异很可能取于球员们在场上相互配合的好坏程度。类似地，单个球员可能在联盟球队中表现尚好，而在国家队中却表现欠佳，因为该球员在两个团队中的相对位置有所不同。团队的表现是某种涌现现象，它不仅取決于单个参与者的才能或个体技艺的总和，而且还取決于参与者之间所形成的互动网络。许多涌现现象都严重依赖于其底层的网络结构。

网络方法将所有注意力都集中在了单个系统内相互作用的全局结构之上，而每个组成部分的具体属性均被忽略。结果，像计算机网络、生态系统或者社会群体等十分不同的系统都用同一种工具来描绘，那就是图（graph），即由多种关联所结成的一种单一的节点架构。这个方法最初由昂哈德·欧拉在数学领域发展起来，之后扩展至广泛的学科领域，包括大量使用这种方法的社会学，以及最近的物理学、工程学、计算机科学、生物学和其他诸多学科领域。

使用同一种工具来表现差异显著的不同系统只能以某种高度抽象的方式完成。系统细节描述的缺失在普适形式中得到弥补，即将十分不同的系统视作相同理论结构的不同实现形式而加以考虑。由此观之，计算机病毒的传播可能与流感类似；劫持一个路由器可能与某个物种在生态系统中的灭绝有着相同的影响；而万维网的增长则能与科学文献的增长放在一起比较。

这条推理线索提供了诸多洞见。比如，把系统呈现为图能让我们察觉到那些将明显不相关元素囊括在内的大规模结构。2003 年，瑞士电网中的一个小事故角触发了一场大规模停电事件，其影响波及 1000 公里之外的西西里岛。专注网络结构让我们看到，遥远事物之间最终可能通过难以置信的关系或传播短路径而强烈地关联着。地理和社会上相互隔离的两个个体 —— 比如某个热帯雨林中的居民和伦敦金融城中的某位经理 —— 仅通过六度分隔（six degrees of separation）就能相互关联，这个最近的观察与现实相去不远。并且，这种现象可用社会关系的网络结构加以解释。

网络方法还揭示出系统的另一个重要特征，即某些不受外部控制而发展起来的系统仍然能够随机发展出某种内部秩序。细胞或生态系统并非「设计」而成，但仍以某种牢固的方式起作用。类似地，社会群体及社会趋势源于大量不同的压力和动机，但仍然展现出清晰和确定的图景。而互联网和万维网则在缺乏任何监管机构的情况下兴盛起来，并由大量不相关的因素所推动，但它们通常还是按照一致且有效的方式运转。所有这些现象都是自组织过程，即系统内部秩序和组织并非外部干预或整体设计的结果，而是局部机制或倾向在成千上万次相互作用中迭代产生的现象。网络模型能够以清楚和自然的方式描述自组织在诸多系统中是如何产生的。同样，网络让我们能够更好地理解诸如计算机病毒的快速传、大规模流行病、基础设施的突然崩溃，以及社交恐惧症或音乐流行之爆发等各种动态过程。

在复杂、涌现以及自组织系统的研究领域（即关于复杂性的现代科学）中，网络作为通用的数学框架而变得愈发重要，涉及大量数据时尤其如此。这通常体现于个人在搜索引擎中的累积查询、社交网站的更新、在线支付、信用卡数据、金融交易、移动电话中的 GPS（全球定位系）位置等情况中在所有这些情形下，网络对于整理和组织这些数据，进而将个人、产品和新闻等相互关联而言是重要的工具。类似地，分子生物学则越来越依赖计算策略以便在其自身产生的大量数据中找到秩序。科学、技术、健康、环境和社会等许多其他领域也是如此。在所有 6 这些情况中，网络正成为掲示复杂性之隐藏结构的典范。

## 0201. A Fruitful Approach

富有成效的方法

### 2.1 Crossing Euler's bridges

In the Russian city of Kaliningrad, the island of Kneiphof stands in the Pregel River. Three centuries ago, the city was in Prussia, it was called Königsberg, and at that time seven bridges connected the island with the rest of the city ( Figure 2 top). A riddle was popular in the town: was it possible to walk across the seven bridges, without crossing any of them twice? Nobody had ever been able to do this successfully. On the other hand, no formal proof was available about the feasibility of such a walk. The solution came from one of the most famous mathematicians of all times. In 1736, Leonard Euler drew a map of Königsberg in an unusual fashion. He represented the portions of mainland and the island as dots, and the bridges as lines, connecting the dots with each other ( Figure 2 bottom).

When we cast the problem in this form, things become easier. By showing the network out of the city, Euler proved that the walk was impossible. His explanation is based on the following observation: for such a walk to be feasible, all the dots along the path must have an even number of connections. This is because every time one enters any part of the city via a bridge, one must leave via a different bridge. In general, each area must have an even number of bridges, e.g. 2, 4, 6. Only the start points and end points of the walk can have an odd number of links: at the start point, there can be only one bridge; and the same holds for the end point. Unfortunately, the graph of Königsberg has all the vertices with an odd number of links. Therefore it is impossible to walk only once over all the bridges.

2 An engraving of Königsberg (top), now Kaliningrad, showing the Königsberg bridges riddle, represented by Leonard Euler as a graph (bottom)

Such a simpilified mathematical map of Königsberg is the first example of a graph . Mathematicians call the dots and lines forming it (respectively) vertices and edges . Nowadays, Euler is credited for having started a whole branch of mathematics, built on graph analysis. His intuition can be considered the first, foundational moment of network science. After him, many mathematicians studied the formal properties of networks, while scientists applied them to a wide range of problems: electrical circuits by G. R. Kirchhoff in 1845, isomers of organic components by A. Cayley in 1857, the mathematical concept known as the ‘Hamiltonian cycle’ by W. R. Hamilton in 1858, etc. One famous application is the ‘map colouring problem’, proposed in the mid-19th century. At that time, geographers were sorting out the minimum number of colours needed to draw maps, where adjacent countries have different colours. This was more than a theoretical problem: given the large number of countries and the reduced quantity of different inks available in the print industry, it was essential to be able to use the minimum number of colours. Empirically, three colours were not enough while four seemed to work well. The first proof that the solution was indeed four was obtained only in 1976. It is based on representing a map as a graph, where nodes are the countries and an edge is drawn between two of them if they share a border.

穿越欧拉之桥

在俄罗斯的加里宁格勒市，一座名为奈佛夫的岛屿坐落于普雷格尔河内。该市 300 年前曾隶属于普鲁土王国，彼时唤作哥尼斯堡，而奈佛夫岛与该市其余部分则由七座桥相互连接（图 2 上）。当时的城里流行着一个谜题：是否可能在不重复走过一座桥的情況下，遍历所有七座桥？

之前没有任何人成功做到这一点。另一方面，对这种走法的可行性，当时也不存在任何形式证明。而其解决方案来自古往今来最著名的数学家之一。1736 年，菜昂哈德·欧拉以一种不寻常的方式画出了哥尼斯堡市的地图。他将陆地和岛屿的部分表示为点，而桥则为连接各点的线（图 2 下）。

当我们以这种方式看待该问题，事情就变得更加容易了。通过展示城市的网络结构，欧拉证明了谜题中的走法不可能。他的解释基于以下观察：若此种走法可行，则路程沿线所有点的连接数必为偶数。这是因为每当某人通过一座桥进入该市的任何部分时，他必须通过另外一座不同的桥离开。总之每个区域必须有偶数座桥，比如 2 座、4 座、6 座等等。只有起点和终点可以有奇数个连接数：起点只能有一座桥，终点亦复如此。不幸的是，哥尼斯堡地图所有顶点的连接数均为奇数。因此，人们不可能一次性谝历所有桥而不重复。

图 2 版画中的哥尼斯堡（上），即现在的加里宁格，它表现了哥尼斯堡七桥之谜，菜昂哈德·欧拉将其表示为一幅简图（下）

哥尼斯堡地图这种简单的数学图是图的首个例子。数学家将构成这幅图的点和线分别称为顶点和边。如今，欧拉已经因为开启了一整个建立在图解分析基础之上的数学分支而被人们铭记。他的这种直觉可被认为是网络科学的首个创立契机。在他之后，许多数学家都曾研究过网络的形式特征，科学家则将它们应用于更加广泛的问题之中：1845 年 G.R.基尔霍夫的电路，1857 年 A.凯利的有机成分异构体，1858 年由 W.R.哈密顿提出的「哈密顿圏」，等等。其中一个著名的应用是于 19 世纪中期提出的「地图着色问题」。当时，地理学家正在设法计算出绘制地图所需的最小颜色数量，其中相邻的国家应有不同的颜色。这不仅仅是个理论问题：考虑到为数众多的国家和印刷行业中数量有限的不同油墨，使用最少数量的颜色显得至关重要。从经验角度看，三种颜色不够用，四种颜色则似乎很奏效。人们直到 1976 年オ证实了解决方案确为四种颜色。证明基于将一张地图以图的方式呈现出来，其中的节点为国家，边则画在两个共享一个边界的国家之间。

### 2.2 Runaway girls, Australian peoples, and Chicago workers

In the autumn of 1932, fourteen An engraving of Königsberg (top)ugu girls ran away in a period of just two weeks from Hudson School for Girls, in New York State. This was much more than the usual rate of runaways. School managers then decided to look into the individual personalities of the girls, to understand this phenomenon. Since no striking evidence of particular differences in the girls’ personalities was found, the psychiatrist Jacob Moreno proposed a completely different explanation. He suggested that this large number was triggered by the position of runaways in the girls’ social network. Moreno, together with Helen Jennings, mapped the social ties between the students, using sociometry , a technique for identifying relations between individuals. They found that these ties were the main channel through which the idea of running away spread among the girls. The position of an individual in the friendship network was crucial for replicating the behaviour of the runaway girls.

Moreno was one of the first researchers to apply the idea of network to society. After Euler’s intuition, his work is a second and crucial step in network science foundations, starting one of the most important lines of network science: the analysis of social networks. Thirty years later, anthropologists applied a similar approach to kinship relations in tribes such as the Arunda people in Australia. In this case, the connections were drawn between individuals who were relatives. Researchers found that the resulting diagrams responded to elegant mathematical structures. These and other results suggested that neat social structures, or even universal laws, could be found underneath the disorder of the human social world. Since then, social sciences have widely deployed the concept of network to represent social structure. Many other studies followed these seminal ones, focusing on the circles of women in southern America (by A. Davis, B. B. Gardner, and M. R. Gardner in 1941), groups of factory workers in Chicago (by E. Mayo in 1939), friendship between schoolchildren (by A. Rapoport in 1961), and the relations between drug addicts in the city of Colorado Springs (by Richard B. Rothenberg et al. in 1995), among others.

出走的女孩，澳大利亚人和芝加哥工人

1932 年的秋天，在两个星期内有 14 名女孩从位于纽约州的哈德森女子学校中出走。这种出走率不同寻常。学校管理层于是决定调查这些女孩的个性，以便理解这种现象。由于没有发现女孩们的性格有特殊差异的明显证据，精神科医生雅各布·莫雷诺便提出了一种完全不同的解释。他指出这种大规模出走情形是由出走女孩们在社交网络中的位置引发的。莫雷诺和海伦·詹宁斯一起利用社会计量学，即一种能够识别个体之间关系的技术，绘制了学生之间的社会关系图。他们发现，这些关系是出走的想法在女孩们之间传播的主要渠道。个人在友谊网络中的位置对其模仿出走女孩的行为至关重要。

莫雷诺是第一批将网络理念应用于社会的研究者之一。继欧拉的直觉之后，他的研究成为网络科学创立的第二个关键步骤，它开启了网络科学最重要的分支之一：社交网络分析。30 年之后，人类学家采用了类似的方法研究部落的亲属关系，比如对澳大利亚阿伦达人部落的研究。在这个案例中，互为亲属的人们之间的联系图得到绘制。研究人员发现，他们得到的结果图对应着优雅的数学结构。这些以及其他结果都表明，在人类社会的无序之下，暗含着精巧的社会结构，甚至是普遍法则。从那时起，社会科学便广泛运用网络概念来呈现社会结构。

许多其他的研究也遵循着这些最初的研究方法，比如，对南美洲妇女群体（A.戴维斯、B.B.加德纳以及 M.R.加德纳等人，1941）、芝加哥工厂的工人群体（E.梅奥，1939）、学童之间的友谊（A.拉波波特，1961），以及对科罗拉多州斯普林斯市吸毒者之间关系的研究（理查德·B.罗隊伯格等人，1995），诸如此类。

### 2.3 Random connections

The third important moment in the foundation of network science came with the publication of a set of papers by the two mathematicians Paul Erd ő s and Alfréd Rényi, in 1959–61. Erd ő s, one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century, has been described as ‘a man who loved only numbers’. Partly wrong: he loved graphs too. The two theorists studied a mathematical model representing a graph where vertices are connected to each other completely at random. This model, lately known as Random Graph, was first proposed in 1951, in a paper by mathematics researchers Ray Salomonoff and Anatol Rapoport.

The random graph is a very simplified model, and its properties are very different from those of real networks. For example, randomness and chance could indeed play an important role in meeting new friends, but the formation of friendship networks is certainly related to many other factors, such as social class, common languages, affinity etc. However, the random graph model is very important because it quantifies the properties of a totally random network. Random graphs can be used as a benchmark, or null case , for any real network. This means that a random graph can be used in comparison to a real-world network, to understand how much chance has shaped the latter, and to what extent other criteria have played a role.

The simplest recipe for building a random graph is the following. We take all the possible pairs of vertices. For each pair, we toss a coin: if+anH5Atak the result is heads, we draw a link; otherwise we pass to the next pair, until all the pairs are finished (this means drawing the link with a probability p = ½, but we may use whatever value of p ). Typically, the creation of the graph and its study are not done manually. Scientists use computer programs and draw the resulting network on paper or on computer screen. However, this becomes increasing difficult when the network is large. Moreover, it is hard to study an interwoven structure just by visual inspection. A better and quantitative insight comes from studying the graph as an abstract object, by means of mathematical tools. Computers can also help: simulation allows us to build, within the ‘mind’ of a computer, a faithful realization of the model, and then make measurements of it as if it were a real object. If we want to compare the abstract model with a real-world network, now we just need to compare the measures in both cases.

Since its introduction in the sixties, the random graph model has become one of the most successful mathematical models, despite its loose connection with reality. Nowadays it is a benchmark of comparison for all networks, since any deviations from this model suggest the presence of some kind of structure, order, regularity, and non-randomness in many real-world networks.

随机联系

网络科学创立的第三个重要时刻则随着保罗·埃尔德什和阿尔弗雷德·雷尼这两位数学家在 1959 年到 1961 年间一系列论文的发表而到来。埃尔德什是 20 世纪最重要的数学家之一，人们称他为「数字情种」。这句话不全对 —— 他也钟爱着图形。这两位理论家研究了某种表示图的数学模型，其中的顶点完全随机地连接。数学研究人员雷·萨洛莫诺夫和阿纳托尔·拉波波特最早于 1951 年在一篇论文中提出了这种后来被称作随机图的模型。

随机图是一种十分简化的模型，其特征与那些真实网络載然不同。比如，随机性和概率的确可能在结交新朋友的过程中发挥重要作用，但是友谊网络的形成肯定也与许多其他因素相关，比如社会阶层、共同语言、吸引力等等。然而，随机图模型仍然非常重要，因为它量化了完全随机网络的性质。随机图能用作任何真实网络的基准或无效状态。这意味着，我们能将随机图与真实世界的网络进行对比，进而了解概率在多大程度上塑造了后者，以及其他标准在何种程度上起了作用。

以下是构建随机图的最简单方法。我们取所有可能的顶点对，然后为每一对顶点抛掷硬币：如果结果是正面朝上，则画出一个连线；否则我们转向下一对顶点，直到遍历所有顶点对（这意味着我们以 p=1/2 的概率绘制顶点连线，但可能会用到 p 的任意值）。通常，图的创建及相关研究都不是人们手动完成的。科学家运用计算机程序，在图纸或电脑屏幕上绘制生成网络图。然而，当网络模很大时，这项工作就会变得越发困难。

此外，人们仅通过目测很难研究相互交织的结构。运用数学工具将图作为抽象对象进行研究能够提供更好的量化的见解。计算机对此也有帮助：模拟使我们能够在计算机的「头脑」中将这种模型可靠地具象化，然后对其进行测量，就像它是个真实的物体一样。如果我们想要将抽象模型与真实世界网络进行比较，现在只需要比较两种情況下的测量数据。

自上世纪 60 年代被引进以来，随机图模型已成为最成功的数学模型之ー，尽管它与现实的联系并不紧密。现在，它是所有网络进行比对的基准，因为任何对此模型的偏离都表明了在许多现实世界网络中存在着某种结构、秩序、规律性和非随机性。

### 2.4 Nets to fish for information

In the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001, in Madrid in 2004, and in London in 2005, several governments have proposed, as an anti-terrorist measure, the storage of electronic traffic data. In this proposal, years of phone calls and emails between citizens would be recorded for safety purposes. The content of the messages would not be stored: it would be enough to record only senders and recipients (and sometimes time and place of communication). As police forces know, even this simple map of who is connected with whom is a powerful instrument in tracking people’s activity. Indeed from a sketch of phone calls, we can deduce habits, circles of friends, and various other data about a person.

This is a very practical example — and a very debated one — of the basic approach of network science. A complex system is represented as a graph — a set of equal elements connected by equal interactions — ignoring the detailed features of its constituents, and the specific nature of their relations. This procedure may seem too drastic, but still it allows us to capture more information than expected at first sight. A proof of the effectiveness of this approach is the friendship advice system contained in many online social networks, such as Facebook or LinkedIn. The idea is simple: you are likely to know the friends of your friends. As simple as it is, it works most of the times. This method, called educated guess , is also behind the systems that suggest books or other items in online shops. The software of these companies exploits networks of goods associated with each consumer. This is why commercial companies store a great deal of electronic data, including email messages and online social network data: they know that this information is extremely useful.

The basic approach of network science can be applied to a broad set of systems. For example, an ecosystem composed of hundreds of species, where each one extracts energy from others by means of different strategies of predation. In the network approach, this is represented by a set of identical vertices connected by a set of identical edges. The same strategy is applied to systems ranging from the Internet (hundreds of thousands of computers, routers, exchange points, etc., connected by telephone lines, fibre optic cables, satellite communications, etc.) to a human population (a huge number of a bare architecture of nodes anH5Atakactors with different purposes and roles, connected by a variety of relations). While the network approach eliminates many of the individual features of the phenomenon considered, it still maintains some of its specific features. Namely, it does not alter the size of the system — i.e. the number of its elements — or the pattern of interaction — i.e. the specific set of connections between elements. Such a simplified model is nevertheless enough to capture the properties of the system.

捕获信息之网

当纽约、马德里、伦敦分别于 2001、2004、2005 年遭遇死灰复燃般的恐怖袭击之后，一些政府机构提议存储电子信息流数据，并将其作为一项反恐措施。在这项提议中，公民之间多年的电话和电邮都会以安全的名义被记录在案。具体的通信内容则不会被储存，仅记录信息的发出者和接收者便已足够（有时候还包括通信的时间和地点信息）。正如警方所知晓的那样，即便这种简单的谁与谁之间相互关联的图景也是追踪人们活动的强大工具。的确，略略看一下某人的电话记录，我们就可以推断出他的习惯、朋友圏以及各种相关的其他数据。

这是网络科学基本方法的一个非常实际也具争议的例子。复杂系統由图 一一 通过同样的相互作用而彼此关联的一组等价元素 一一 表示，却忽略了其组成部分的详细特征，以及它们之间关系的具体性质。这一做法似乎过于激进，但它仍然让我们能够捕获到比乍看之下可预期到的更多的信息。这种方法的一个有效证明便是内嵌于诸多在线社交网络中的朋友推荐系统，比如「脸书」或「领英」。其中的想法很简单：你很可能认识你朋友的朋友。虽然很简单，却在多数情况下都有效。这种方法被称为有根据的推测，它也是很多在线商店的书籍或其他商品推荐系统的基础。这些公司的软件利用了与每个消费者相关的商品网络。这就是为何商业公司会储存大量的电子数据，包括电子邮件和在线社交网络数据 一一 它们知道这种信息十分有用。

网络科学的基本方法可应用于广泛的系统之中。例如由数百个物种组成的生态系统，其中每个物种通过不同的捕食策略从其他物种中提取能量。在网络方法中，这种情況由一组相同的边连接起来的一组相同顶点表示。同样的策略被应用于从互联网（通过电话线、光纤电缆、卫星通信等方式连接起来的无数计算机、路由器和交互站点等）到人口族群（通过各种关系相互联系且拥有不同目的和身份的大量行动者）的各种系之中。尽管网络方法消除了所考虑现象的许多个别特征，它仍然保留了个体的某些特征。也就是说，这种方法并不改变系統的大小ー一系统元素的数量，也不会改变相互作用的模式 一一 元素之间的特定连接集合。然而这种简化的模型仍然足以捕获系统的特性。

### 2.5 From individuals to groups

There are two possible approaches when dealing with a situation where many different elements interact in different ways. In the first approach, we identify the basic constituents and interactions between them. By studying each element on its own, we can then deduce the behaviour of the system as the sum of its individual elements. For example, ecologists can describe the features of an ecosystem by listing prey and predators of every single species. Computer scientists describe a network of computers by focusing on the features and protocols of each different machine. Psychologists study social relations by describing the behaviour of each social actor in his or her circle. A second strategy, different from the first one, consists in putting many elements together into a few homogeneous groups. For example, sociologists and political scientists usually split society into social classes, genders, levels of education, ethnicities, nations, etc. Similarly, epidemiologists often separate the population into a limited set of ‘compartments’: healthy individuals, infected, immunized, etc. Ecologists can also use this approach by aggregating into groups ( trophic species) all the species that have similar roles in a foodweb.

The network approach tries to complement these two points of view. Many phenomena are impossible to explain if one focuses only on the behaviour of individual elements. For example, the dynamics of a species population within an ecosystem do not depend on the features of that species alone: the global network of prey–predator interactions must be taken into account. On the other hand, focusing on big classes of elements may not be useful either. For example, the political phenomena taking place in a country are hardly the outcome of a pre-existing national identity but rather of the specific pattern of social relations within that country. The network approach is somewhere between the description by individual elements and the description by big groups, bridging the two of them. In a certain sense, networks try to explain how a set of isolated elements are transformed, through a pattern of interactions, into groups and communities. In all cases where this pattern is relevant, the network approach provides essential insights.

从个体到群体

在处理多种不同元素以不同方式相互作用的情况时，存在两种可能的方法。第一种方法是确认这种情况中的基本成分以及它们之间的相互作用。通过研究每个元素本身，我们可以将系统的行为推导为个体元素的加总。例如，生态学家可以通过列出每个物种的猎物和捕食者来描述生态系统的特征。计算机科学家通过关注每个不同机器的特征和协议来描述计算机网络。心理学家则通过描述每个社交者在他的子中的行为来研究社会关系。与第一种策略不同，第二种策略旨在将许多元素组合成为若干同类的群体。例如，社会学家和政治学家通常按照社会阶层、性别、教育水平、种族、国家等因素对社会进行划分。

同样，流行病学家则常常将人口分成一组有限的「区划」：健康的、感染的、免疫的个体等。生态学家也能用同样的方法将所有在食物网中扮演类似角色的物种汇集成群组（即营养物种）。

网络方法试图补充这两种策略。若我们只关注个体元素的行为，许多现象就无法得到解释。例如，生态系统内物种的数量动态并不单单依赖于该物种自身的特征，猎物-捕食者相互作用的全局网络也必须考虑在内。另一方面，专注于大类的元素也可能没什么用。比如，一国发生的政治现象基本上不是由先前存在的国家认同引起的，而是该国内部社会关系的具体模式运作的结果。网络方法则介于通过单个元素和通过大群组进行的描述之间，并将二者连接起来。在某种意义上，网络试图解释一组孤立的元素是如何通过相互作用的模式转化为群体和共同体的。在与这种模式相关的所有情况下，网络方法都提供了重要的洞见。

### 2.6 Geography versus 'netography'

At the beginning of the 20th century, London’s underground train service (the Tube) became so intricate that more and more complicated maps had to be issued from time to time, in order to orient the travellers. In 1931, after many attempts, Henry Beck, an employee of the company, changed the criteria for drawing the chart. Instead of embedding the lines on top of an actual map of London, Beck placed them in an abstract space ( Figure 3 ). Stations were represented by well-spaced dots. Tube connections became straight lines with neat angles of 45 or 90 degrees. This map has little to do with the real positions and distances of stations, but it is much clearer and more useful for the passengers. Those travelling on the Tube network are not interested in its geographic features: the information about the sequence of stations and the intersec+anH5Ataktion of Tube lines is enough.

3 A ‘metric’ representation of the London Tube (top) versus a ‘topological’ one (bottom). Even though in the latter the actual positions and relative distances of the stations are not indicated, it is a more useful mind map of the service

Henry Beck’s London’s Tube map is basically a graph. His solution to the mapping problem exploited a basic feature of the network approach: in networks, topology is more important than metrics . That is, what is connected to what is more important than how far apart two things are: in the other words, the physical geography is less important than the ‘netography’ of the graph. The difference between these two concepts is shown in Figure 4 . The three images represented in the picture are different from a metric point of view. That is, the positions of nodes in space and the lengths of links are different. However, from the topological point of view they are identical: they are just three different representations of the same graph. In the network representation, the connections between the elements of a system are much more important than their specific positions in space and their relative distances.

The focus on topology is one of its biggest strengths of the network approach, useful whenever topology is more relevant than metrics. For example, an email sent from New York reaches an office in London in the same time as one sent from the office next door. Even on the Internet, a material infrastructure embedded in geographical space, the pattern of the connections is more important than the physical distance. In social networks, the relevance of topology means that social structure matters. Lionel Messi is nowadays one of the best football players in the world. However, his performance differs according to which team he is playing in (either Argentina or FC Barcelona). Some social scientists have argued that the network of Messi’s relations with other players in Argentina is different from that in FC Barcelona. According to their research, this results in the player carrying a heavier ‘weight’ in the former case: this may explain, at least in part, the difference in his performance. Similar phenomena appear also in more complicated social ‘games’, where an individual’s outcome can be strongly influenced by his or her position in a network of relations.

地理与「网络图」

20 世纪初，伦敦的地铁服务变得十分复杂，以至于人们必须不时地发布愈来愈多的地图以便为出行者提供向导。1931 年，经过多次尝试，地铁公司的雇员亨利·贝克改变了绘制地铁路线图的标准。与那种将地铁路线嵌入伦敦实际地图之上的做法相反，贝克将它们置于抽象的空间中（图 3）。站点由间隔合适的点表示，而线路的连接则全部变成了具有 45 或 90 度角的直线。这个地图无关车站的真实位置及其相互之间的实际距离，但它对乘客而言更加清楚且有用。乘用地铁网络的人对其地理特征不感兴趣，有车站的序和地铁路线的交汇信息便已足够。

图 3 伦地铁的「度量」示意图（上）与「拓扑」示意图（下）。尽管车站的实际位置和相对距离都未呈现在拓扑图中，它却是地铁服务的更佳思维导图

1『原来地铁站里的地图，这么有讲究的。（2021-01-05）』

亨利·贝克的伦敦地铁图基本上就是一个图。他解決映射问题的方案利用了网络方法的一个基本特征：在网络中，拓扑比度量更为重要。也就是说，何物与何物相互关联比它们相隔多远更加重要。换句话说，图的实际地理情形不如其「网络图」重要。这两个概念的差异如图 4 所示。从度量角度看图中呈现的三个图形有所不同。也就是说，空间中的节点位置和节点连线的长度有所不同。然而，从拓学的角度看，它们是相同的 一一 它们只是同一个图的三种不同呈现方式。在网络的表示方式中，系统元素之间的关联比它们的相对距离以及在空间中的具体位置要重要得多。

对拓扑学的关注是网络方法的最大优势之一，当拓扑与度量相比更为适用时，网络方法就是有用的。例如，从纽约发送至伦敦某办公室的电子邮件会与来自其隔壁办公室的邮件同时抵达。即便在互联网这种嵌入地理空间的实体基础设施中，连接的模式也比物理距离更加重要。在社交网络中，拓扑的实用性意味着社会结构很重要。里奥内尔·梅西是当今世界最好的足球运动员之ー。然而，他的表现却随着他所效力球队（比如阿根廷国家队或者巴塞罗那足球俱乐部队）的不同而有所不同。一些社会科学家认为，梅西在阿根廷国家队中与其他队员之间的关系网络不同于他在巴塞罗那足球俱乐部队中的关系网络。根据他们的研究，这会导致球员在前一种情況下背负更重的「负担」，这至少能部分解释他在不同球队中的表现差异。类似的现象也出现在更加复杂的社交「游戏」中，个人在其中的境况会受到他或她在关系网络中所处位置的强烈影响。

### 2.7 Chains, grids, and networks

The network approach reduces complex systems to a bare architecture of nodes and links. This is a substantial simplification, but still the resulting graph may not be so easy to interpret: this is the case with the tricky illustration shown in Figure 4 . Even a graph as simple as an innocent chain of nodes can be a rather complicated object to handle. A chain may represent, for example, a fire brigade moving a bucket of water; or a food chain of species, in which the first predates the second, which predates the third, and so on; or a business-to-business supply structure: a set of companies in which each one supp Very Short Introductionegulies the next one.

Imagine a production chain of five companies (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Along this chain, any of them can make a deal with either of its two neighbours. The rule is that each company can close only one contract: for example, if 3 closes a deal with 2, it cannot have arrangements with 4. Given this simple structure and rule, it turns out that nodes 1 and 5 have less bargaining power, since they have fewer alternatives. This makes nodes 2 and 4 stronger, and (unexpectedly) it weakens node 3. Indeed, node 3 has only strong nodes to deal with, and therefore it ends up having less convenient deals. Something as simple as a linear sequence of nodes does indeed yield a rather complex landscape. This example shows what sociologists call an exclusion mechanism . Far from being a theoretical situation, this is commonly experienced in economics, when the establishment of a commercial relation between two parts excludes a third node.

To further complicate the question, one has to take into account that real-world systems are rarely as simple as a chain. In the past, scientists have represented complex systems through regular grids or lattices , instead of using graphs. These objects are composed of many elements — representing people, animals, computers, etc. — usually arranged along a regular pattern of connections, like pieces on a chessboard connecting only with their four neighbours. This regular structure makes systems much easier to handle by mathematical calculation and by computer simulation than when using a graph.

The lattice choice, albeit simpler with respect to a graph, introduces nevertheless a strong limitation. In fact, a lattice is suitable only for representing systems carefully designed or subject to strong constraints. These might be, for example, the arrays of processors in a computing cluster or verbal communications between chain workers in a noisy workplace. In lattices, every node is linked to a fixed number of nearest neighbours, while in the vast majority of real-world cases, links connect a variable number of elements, no matter whether close to or far away from each other. The ability to capture this disorder is one of the great advantages of the network approach.

Much of this disorder is encoded in a crucial quantity: the degree, that is, the number of edges attached to each node. If a node is a web page, the degree represents the number of links it receives from other pages. If a node is a species, the degree is the number of species it depends on for feeding. If a node is an individual, the degree is the number of acquaintances. This circle can be related to what sociologist Peter Marsden has called a core discussion network: the set of people (friends, partners, family members, current and past schoolmates, co-workers, neighbours, fellow members of clubs, professional advisers, consultants, etc.) with whom one discusses important matters or spends time.

链条、网格和网络

网络方法将复杂系统简化为单一的点线架构。这是一个重大的简化，但其得出的结果图却可能不是那么容易得到解释：这便是图 4 所示的棘手例子展示的情况。甚至一幅仅由节点连接而成的链条图也可以是一个处理起来相当复杂的对象。一个链条可以代表比如搬运一桶水的消防队；或者物种的食物链，其中，第一个捕食第二个，第二个捕食第三个，以此类推；或者企业之间的供应结构 一一 一系列公司中每个公司供给下个公司。

想象一下五家公司（公司 1, 2, 3, 4 和 5）的生产链。在这个链条沿线，其中任何一家公司都能与其两个邻居之一达成交易。其中的规则为，每个公司只能签订一份合同例如，如果公司 3 与公司 2 达成了交易，则它不能与公司 4 另有协议安排。给定了这个简单的结构和规则，结果便是位于节点 1 和节点 5 的公司议价能力更低，因为它们的选择更少。这导致公司 2 和公司 4 更加强大，并且（意外地）削弱了位于节点 3 上的公司。确实，节点 3 上的公司只得应付更加强大的公司，因此，它最终只能达成不那么有利的交易。简单如节点线性序列这样的事物确实产生了相当复杂的景观。社会学家将这个例子呈现的现象称为排斥机制。这远非理论中的情況，而是经济学中经常能遇到的情形 一一 当两个公司之间建立商业关系以排除第三方时便是这样。

为了进一步深入这个问题，人们必须考虑到现实中的系统绝少如链条这般简单。在过去，科学家用规则网格或晶格表示复杂的系统，而非使用图。这些对象由许多元素组成 —— 分别代表人、动物、计算机等等 一一 它们通常按照规则的连接模式排列，例如棋盘上的棋子仅与其四邻的棋子相连。相对于用图表示而言，这种规则结构使得系统能够更容易被数学计算和计算机模拟这两种方式处理。

尽管格子相对于图而言更加简单，但它引入了强烈的限制条件。事实上，一个格子仅适于呈现经过精心设计或受到强烈约束的系统。比如，这些系统可能是某个计算集群的处理器阵列，或者某个嘈杂工作场所中彼此关联的工人之间的语言交流。在格子框架中，每个节点都连接着固定数量的最近连接点，而在绝大多数真实情况中，这些连接则关联着数量可变的元素，无论它们彼此是邻近还是相隔很远。捕获这种混乱状态的能力是网络方法的最大优点之一。

大部分这种无序状态都被编码为某种关键的数量 一一 度数，即附着于每个节点之上的边数。如果节点是网页，度数则表示了该网页与其他页面的链接数量。如果节点是物种，度数则表示了该物种赖以生存的物种数量。如果节点是一个人，度数则表示了其熟人的数量。这个圏子能与社会学家彼得·马斯登所谓的核心讨论网络联系起来，即那些可与之讨论重要事宜或打发时间的人群（朋友、伙伴、家庭成员、现在和过去的同学、同事、邻居、俱乐部伙伴、专业顾问、咨询员等等）。

### 2.8 Mapping relationships

Two people can have an infinite set of possible relations. They may share attitudes, ideas, or gender. They may be friends, relatives, or co-workers. They may be sexual partners or simply play in the same football team. Furthermore, two or more of these connections may simultaneously occur between the same couple of people. Some of them are cooperative relations, while others convey open hostility, with an entire spectrum possible in between. Finally, some can be perceived only by one side and ignored by the other (e.g. the fans of a rock star feel linked to him, while the star may simply ignore them). Sociology has classified a broad range of possible links between individuals ( Table 1 ). The tendency to have several kinds of relationships in social networks is called multiplexity . But this phenomenon appears in many other networks: for example, two species can be connected by different strategies of predation, two computers by different cables or wireless connections, etc.

We can modify a basic graph to take into account this multiplexity, e.g. by attatching specific tags to edges. For instance, we can take into account whether a connection is positive or negative. Species are linked by predation (negative), but also by mutualism (e.g. the positive relation established between flowering plants and pollinators). People can be enemies (negative) or friends (positive). A web page can link to another web page to criticize its content (negative) or to advertise it (positive). Adding this simple binary feature complicates things a lot. Imagine a group of three people, Alice, Bob, and Carol. When positive relations connect all of them, everything is fine. Alternatively, Alice and Bob may be linked by friendship but both have hostile relations towards Carol. Things get complicated when the situation is reversed: Alice has positive relations with both Bob and Carol, but the two of them hate each other. And things get really problematic when everybody hates everybody else. According to sociology, the first and the second situation are structurally balanced , while the third and the fourth are not. In 2006, mathematician Tibor Antal and physicists Paul Krapivsky and Sidney Redner applied this concept to the shifting diplomatic alliances between six European countries before the First World War. They showed that their alliance gradually evolved into a structurally balanced situation, where either strong alliances were established or clear common enemies were identified. The six countries became divided into two groups (on one side, Britain, France, and Russia; on the other, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy), each of them allied to all the countries in its group and enemy to all the countries in the other group. Soon after this situation had come about, the war broke out. This example shows that structural balance is not necessarily something desirable.

Table 1. A classification of ties in social networks.

Graph theory allows us to encode in edges more complicated relationships, as when connections are not reciprocal. Wolves predate sheep, blogs link to large newspapers, and some people fell in love with others; the reverse is seldom true. In this case, the connections in the graph are a sort of one-way street where we can travel in one direction but not backwards. If a direction is attached to the edges, the resulting structure is a directed graph where links are indicated by an arrow. In these networks we have both in-degree and out-degree , measuring the number of inbound and outbound links of a node, respectively.

The relations considered so far are binary: that is, they acquire only two values. Such dichotomous connections either exist or do not: for example, being married to somebody or being employed by somebody. Statistically, however, these are exceptions: in most cases, relations display a broad variation of intensity. Predation is counted in the number of prey eaten, web pages can be connected by a sporadic link or by a large number of connections, and love can range from slight attraction to furious passion. Such further features correspond to the weights we can add to the links. Weightedogy, health, e

描绘关系

两个人之间可以有无限的可能关系。他们可能共有同样的态度、想法或性别，可能是朋友、亲戚或同事，也可能是性伴侣或者仅仅效力于同一个足球队。此外，这些关系中的两个或更多可以同时发生在同样两个人身上。其中一些是合作关系，另一些则表示公开的敌对，而介于两者之间的关系则有着广泛的可能。最后，一些关系可能仅仅单方面被感知到，而另一方则完全对其忽略（比如，摇滚明星的粉丝可能感觉自己与其有某种联系，而摇滚明星可能完全忽略了他们）。社会学将个体之间广泛的可能联系进行了分类（表 1）。在社交网络中具有多种关系类型的倾向又被称为关系的多重性。但这种现象也出现在许多其他的网络中例如，两个物种可以通过不同的捕食策略而彼此关联，两个计算机则通过不同的有线或无线连接彼此关联等。

我们可以修改某种基本图来考虑关系的多重性，例如，为关系连线贴上特定的标签等。比如说，我们可以将某种关联是正面还是负面纳入考虑范围。物种通过捕食（负面）或共生（比如在开花植物和授粉者之间建立起的正面关系）而彼此关联。人们可以是敌人（负面）或朋友（正面）。一个网页则可以连接到另外一个网页以批评其内容（负面）或为其做广告（正面）。通过增添这个简单的二进制功能便让事情极大地复杂化了。

想象一个由爱丽丝、鲍勃和卡罗尔组成的三人群体。当他们所有人由正面的关系联系时，一切都安好。又或者，爱丽丝和鲍勃可能是朋友关系，但他们二人均对卡罗尔抱有敌意。当情相反的时候，事情就変得复杂了：爱丽丝与鲍勃和卡罗尔二人都保持着正面的关系，但鲍勃与卡罗尔之间却彼此憎恶。而当他们每个人都彼此憎恶的时候，情况就变得着实棘手了。根据社会学理论，第一种情况和第二种情況在结构上是平衡的，而第三种和第四种情況则相反。

2006 年，数学家蒂博尔·安塔尔和物理学家保罗·克拉皮夫斯基、西徳尼·雷德纳将这个概念应用于第一次世界大战前六个欧洲国家之间外交联盟关系转变的分析之中。他们证明了这六国的联盟逐演化成了一种结构上平衡的状态，在这种情况下，强大的联盟得以建立，或者明确的共同敌人得以确定。这六国后来分裂为两个集团（一方为英国、法国和俄罗斯；另ー方则为奥匈帝国、德国和意大利），每一方的成员国彼此在集团内相互结盟，而对另一方的所有国家保持敌对关系。这种情况出现后不久，战争便爆发了。这个例子表明，结构上的平衡并不必然就是有利的。

表 1 社交网络关系的分类

图论让我们能为边编码更加复杂的关系，当关系并非对称的时候更是如此。狼捕食羊，博客链接到大报，一些人爱上另一些人；相反的情况绝少为真。在这种情况下，图中的关系乃某种单行道，我们可在其中朝着一个方向前进，但不能逆行。如果给边添加方向属性，则得出的结构为有向图，其中的关系由箭头指示。在这些网络中，我们有入度和出度分别测量节点向内与向外的连接数量。

到目前为止，我们所考虑的关系都是二进制的 一一 它们仅有两个值。这种二分关系要么存在，要么不存在：例如，与某人结婚或者被某人雇用。然而，这种关系在统计上都是例外：绝大多数情況下，关系展现出广泛的强度变化。捕食以吃掉猎物的数量计算，网页则能被零星或大量的链接关联，而爱情的强度则从轻微的吸引到强烈的激情不等。这些进一步的特征对应于我们赋予关系的权重。例如，加权网络可能作为个体或事物之间不同交互频率的结果出现。

我们对基本图结构的其他修改也是可能的，且处理这些事物的技术非常有趣。比如，大部分社交网络研究致力于了解不同种类的关系如何互相影响。然而，网络方法的优点在于，在某些情況下，忽略所有或大多数具体细节是合理且有效的：有向网络变得无向，权重被移除，多重连接坍塌为某条单独的边等等。结果表明，这种彻底的简化仍然能够捕获大量信息。
