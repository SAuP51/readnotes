In so doing, they engrain new habits of thinking critically in their minds. If they, and their colleagues, practice how to apply the concepts embedded in the structured techniques when they have time, they will be more capable of applying these critical thinking skills instinctively when under pressure. The five core habits of a master thinker are described in Figure 2.Figure 2: The Five Habits of the Master ThinkerA good analytic thinker who has mastered the core structured analytic techniques will instinctively:Know when to challenge key assumptions—usually far more often than you think!Consider alternative explanations or hypotheses for all events—including the null hypothesis and the deception hypothesis when applicable.Look for inconsistent data that provides sufficient justification to quickly discard a candidate hypothesis.Focus on the key drivers that best explain what has occurred or what is about to happen.Anticipate the customers' needs and understand the overarching context within which the analysis is being done.Habit 1: Challenge Key AssumptionsBecause recognizing and challenging one's own assumptions is so difficult, analysts—and their managers—should strive to create an environment wherein assumptions are constantly being challenged on a daily basis. In a healthy work environment, challenging assumptions should be commonplace, ranging from "Why do you assume we all want pepperoni pizza?" to "Won't increased oil prices force them to reconsider their export strategy?" If you expect your colleagues to challenge your assumptions on a regular basis, you will become more sensitive to when you actually are making assumptions, and you will increasingly ask yourself if they are well-founded. If time allows, you should record your assumptions on a whiteboard or a piece of paper for review at a later date. Writing down the assumptions also greatly facilitates the process of examining them critically. Particular attention should be paid to assumptions that are assessed as Unsupported because these often are key uncertainties that need to be researched or for which collection requirements need to be written.Habit 2: Consider Alternative ExplanationsWhen confronted with a new development, the first instinct of a good analyst is to develop a hypothesis to explain what has occurred based on the available evidence and logic. A master analyst goes one step further and immediately asks whether any alternative explanations should also be considered. While at first glance these alternatives may appear much less likely, over time as new evidence surfaces they may evolve into the lead hypothesis. Analysts who do not generate a set of alternative explanations at the start and lock on to a preferred explanation will often fall into the trap of confirmation bias—focusing on the data that is consistent with their explanation and ignoring or rejecting other data that is inconsistent.If envisioning an alternative explanation is difficult, then a master analyst will establish a null hypothesis, basically establishing in his or her own mind two hypotheses: X and Not X. The Not X hypothesis then becomes a bin in which to put what appears to be anomalous or outlier data that may at a later date might prove far more diagnostic. In some cases, consideration should also be given to establishing a deception hypothesis. This is particularly valuable when there are questions about the reliability of the data or major information gaps exist.Habit 3: Look for Inconsistent DataThe habit of looking for inconsistent data is probably the hardest habit to master of the five, but it is the one that can reap the most benefits in terms of time saved when conducting an investigation or researching an issue. The best way to train your brain to look for inconsistent data is to conduct a series of ACH exercises. Such practice helps the analyst learn how to more readily identify what constitutes compelling contrary evidence. A master analyst will have already generated a set of comprehensive and mutually exclusive hypotheses. If he or she encounters an item of data that is inconsistent with one of the hypotheses in a compelling fashion (for example, a solid alibi), then that hypothesis can be quickly discarded, saving the analyst time by redirecting his or her attention to more likely solutions.Habit 4: Identify Key DriversAsking at the outset what key drivers best explain what has occurred or will foretell what is about to happen constitutes the fourth of the five habits of the master thinker. If the key drivers can be identified, the chances of surprise will be significantly decreased. A practiced analyst should know how to vary the weights of these key drivers (either instinctively or by using such techniques as Multiple Scenarios Generation or Quadrant CrunchingTM) to generate a set of credible alternative scenarios that capture the range of possible outcomes. A master thinker will take this one step further, ensuring that he has generated a set of outcomes that represent both risks and opportunities for the policymaker. Moreover, a master thinker will develop a list of indicators that satisfy the five characteristics of a good indicator: Observable and Collectible, Valid, Reliable, Stable, and Unique. Uniqueness is often the most difficult criterion to satisfy and is best tested by using the Indicators ValidatorTM or other validation system.7Habit 5: Understand the ContextAnalysts often get so engaged in collecting and sorting data that they will miss the forest for the trees. Learning to stop and reflect on the overarching context for the analysis is the last, and one of the most critical, of the five habits. Most analysis is done under considerable time pressure and the tendency is to plunge in as soon as a task is assigned. If the analyst does not take time to reflect on what the customer is really seeking, the resulting analysis could prove inadequate and much of the research done a waste of time. You are better off learning how to "think above your pay grade" at the start by putting yourself in the shoes of management or the individual requesting the analysis. Ask yourself: "What do they need from me?" "How can I help them frame the issue?" and "Do I need to place their question in a broader context?" Failing to do this at the outset can easily result in the analyst going down blind alleys or having to reconceptualize an entire paper if a key assumption is found to be incorrect during coordination or editing.Freeware and proprietary software has been developed to help the analyst learn many of these habits and to perform the analysis with rigor and more quickly. The Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) developed a freeware version of Analysis of Competing Hypothesis under the guidance of Richards J. Heuer and the author.8Globalytica, LLC offers a collaborative, web-based version of ACH called Te@mACHTM for a modest fee. The software is one of three techniques comprising TH!NK SuiteTM which also includes the Multiple Hypotheses GeneratorTM and the Indicators ValidatorTM. Globalytica is also developing two other tools, the Te@m Assumptions CheckTM and Quadrant CrunchingTM, that will guide analysts through the key assumptions process and help them orchestrate the generation of alternative scenarios.9[6] See Richards J. Heuer, Jr. and Randolph H. Pherson, Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis, (Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2011) for definitions of each of these techniques, when to use them, step-by-step instructions on how to use them, and how they add value to the analytic process.[7] See Richards J. Heuer, Jr. and Randolph H. Pherson, Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis, CQ Press: Washington, DC, 2011 for more information about these techniques.[8] The PARC ACH tool can be downloaded from www.globalytica.com or the PARC website.[9] More information about these tools can be found at www.globalytica.com.对此合理意见的最佳回应是，鼓励分析师在时间宽裕时多练习核心技术。这样，他们可以在日常工作中养成新的批判性思维习惯。如果他们和同事在有时间时练习如何应用这些结构化技术的概念，那么在紧急情况下，他们也能更加自然而然地运用这些技能。图 2 描述了一位优秀分析师的五个核心习惯。图 2：大师级思维的五个习惯一个掌握了核心结构化分析技术的优秀分析思维者通常会：经常质疑关键假设，比你想象的频繁得多。考虑所有事件的替代解释或假设，包括零假设和欺骗假设（如果适用）。寻找不一致的数据，以便迅速排除一个候选假设。关注最能解释已发生或即将发生事件的关键驱动因素。预见客户的需求，理解分析的总体背景。习惯 1：挑战关键假设因为识别和挑战自己的假设非常困难，分析师及其经理应该努力创造一个环境，让假设每天都能被挑战。在一个健康的工作环境中，挑战假设应该是一种常见的行为，从「为什么你认为我们都想吃意大利辣香肠披萨？」到「油价上涨是否会迫使他们重新考虑出口策略？」如果你期望同事们经常挑战你的假设，你会更敏锐地意识到自己何时在做假设，并且会越来越多地问自己这些假设是否有依据。如果时间允许，你应该把假设记录在白板或纸上，以便日后审查。写下假设也能大大促进对这些假设的批判性审查。特别要注意那些被评估为不支持的假设，因为这些往往是需要进一步研究的关键不确定性，或者需要编写数据收集需求。习惯 2：考虑替代解释当面对新的情况时，一个优秀的分析师会首先根据现有证据和逻辑提出一个解释。而一个资深分析师会更进一步，立即考虑是否有其他替代解释。虽然这些替代解释乍看之下似乎不太可能，但随着时间推移和新证据的出现，它们可能会变成主要假设。那些一开始没有考虑多种替代解释，而仅仅锁定在单一解释上的分析师，往往会陷入确认偏误的陷阱，只关注支持自己假设的数据，忽视或拒绝不一致的数据。如果很难找到其他解释，高级分析师会先假设「零假设」，即在脑海中建立两个假设：X 和非 X。非 X 假设用来存放那些看似异常或离群的数据，这些数据在未来可能会提供更准确的诊断。在数据可靠性存疑或信息缺乏的情况下，还应考虑建立一个欺骗假设。习惯 3：寻找不一致的数据在五个习惯中，寻找不一致数据可能是最难掌握的，但它能在调查或研究时节省大量时间。训练大脑寻找不一致数据的最佳方法是进行一系列的 ACH 练习，这可以帮助分析师更容易识别强有力的反证。高级分析师通常会生成一组全面且互斥的假设。如果遇到与某个假设不符的数据（例如可靠的不在场证明），该假设可以迅速被排除，从而节省时间，集中精力寻找更可能的解决方案。习惯 4：识别关键驱动因素在思考问题时，首先要问清楚哪些关键因素可以最好地解释已发生的事情或预测即将发生的情况，这是大师级思维习惯中的第四个。如果能识别出这些关键驱动因素，就能大大减少意外情况的发生。一位经验丰富的分析师应该懂得如何调整这些关键因素的权重（无论是凭直觉，还是使用诸如「多场景生成」或「象限压缩」等技术），以生成一组可信的替代情景，涵盖各种可能的结果。大师级思考者会进一步确保这些情景既包括风险也包括机遇。此外，大师级思考者还会制定一套符合优秀指标五个特征的指标：可观察和收集、有效、可靠、稳定和独特。独特性往往最难满足，需要通过「指标验证器」或其他验证系统来进行测试。7习惯 5：理解上下文分析师们常常沉迷于数据的收集和整理工作，结果往往忽略了整体的分析背景。学会停下来思考整个分析的上下文，这是五个关键习惯中最重要的一个。由于大多数分析工作都是在时间紧迫的情况下进行的，分析师们通常会在收到任务后立即开始工作。如果不花时间去理解客户真正的需求，最终的分析可能会不够完善，很多研究工作也可能会白费。我们应该在一开始就学会「站在更高的角度思考」，把自己放在管理层或者提出分析请求的人的位置上。问问自己：「他们需要我提供什么？」「我如何帮助他们定义问题？」以及「我是否需要将他们的问题置于更广泛的背景中？」如果一开始没有这样做，分析师很容易走错方向，或者在协调或编辑过程中发现关键假设不正确时，不得不重新构思整篇论文。为了帮助分析师掌握这些习惯，并以更严谨和高效的方式进行分析，已经开发了一些免费软件和专有软件。Palo Alto Research Center（PARC）在 Richards J. Heuer 和作者的指导下，开发了一款免费的竞争假设分析（Analysis of Competing Hypothesis）软件。Globalytica, LLC 提供了一款名为 Te@mACHTM 的网络协作版 ACH，收费合理。该软件是包含在 TH!NK Suite 中的三种技术之一，其他两种是多假设生成器（Multiple Hypotheses Generator）和指标验证器（Indicators Validator)。Globalytica 还在开发另外两种工具，Te@m Assumptions Check 和 Quadrant Crunching，这些工具将引导分析师完成关键假设过程，并帮助他们组织生成替代情景。[6] 参见 Richards J.
