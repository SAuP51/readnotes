When surface texture is gradually revealed (accretion) or occluded (deletion) over time at the edge of another surface, there is unambiguous evidence that the former surface is farther away from the perceiver then the latter surface. Typically, occluding edges are revealed with movements of the perceiver, and relative movements of environmental features. There are several significant implications of this phenomenon. First, the occluding edge of closer surface is only visible over time. Second, for this reason, the occluding edge is a relational property of the environment-organism processes. In the absence of movement, the occluding edge is not present. Gibson is pointing to the often overlooked ontology of rela- tional properties, which comes to play a foundational role in the proposed ecological approach. Third, perceiving an occluding edge includes an aware- ness of the now-hidden surface and to-be-revealed surface of the farther object. In other words, perceiving has both retrospectivity and prospectivity; it is past- oriented and future-oriented. As William James pointed out, the notion of the present is "specious"from the stance of an active organism-which constitutes yet another challenge to the "picture theory of vision.'在第 III 部分中，有一章特别值得关注，讨论了 Gibson 和他的学生 George Kaplan 发现的「遮挡边缘」现象。当一个表面的纹理逐渐显现（积累）或被另一个表面的边缘遮住（删除）时，这说明前一个表面比后一个表面离观察者更远。通常，随着观察者的移动和环境的变化，遮挡边缘会显露出来。这一现象有几个重要的启示。首先，较近表面的遮挡边缘只有随着时间的推移才能看到。其次，因此遮挡边缘是环境和有机体之间交互的特性，在静止时并不存在。Gibson 强调，这种关系特性常常被忽视，但在他提出的生态学方法中却是基础性的。第三，感知遮挡边缘时，人们会意识到被隐藏的表面和即将显现的更远物体的表面。换句话说，感知过程既包含对过去的回顾，也包含对未来的展望。正如 William James 所说，从一个活跃的有机体的角度来看，「现在」是一个「虚幻」的概念，这对「视觉图像理论」提出了挑战。
