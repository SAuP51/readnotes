基础卡片：我们正在进入一个类似于工业革命前的工匠时代2024-05-16解释：参考：Salman Khan.(2024).2024038Brave-New-Words.Penguin Publishing Group => 0901 Work and What Comes Next原文：We are entering a world where we are going back to a pre–Industrial Revolution, craftsmanlike experience. A small group of people who understand engineering, sales, marketing, finance, and design are going to be able to manage armies of generative AI and put all of these pieces together.When economists talk about the factors of production, they talk about things like capital, labor, land, and other resources such as energy. But they also talk about entrepreneurship. From an economics point of view, entrepreneurship is really the creativity of knowing how to put resources together in order to create value. So how do we prepare every student to be this type of entrepreneur?Step one is to get out of the way. I believe all human beings are born highly creative and entrepreneurial. Unfortunately, our Industrial Revolution–designed education system unintentionally suppresses both traits. Kids learn to sit in rows, make no noise, and take notes. They are spoon-fed knowledge and forced to learn in lockstep. Both academically and socially, nonconformity is punished. When students are young adults and most capable of being creative entrepreneurs, the system instead bogs them down with hours of busywork that squeezes out any time for their passions.Step two is a little bit more traditional. As Bill Gates mentioned, the successful workers of the future will be those with deep and broad skills. The "three Rs" of reading, writing, and arithmetic are more important than ever. On top of that, a solid appreciation and understanding of history, art, science, law, and finance would round out someone well. Luckily, we now have the technological tools to ensure the mastery of these skills without having to enforce the lockstep learning of the industrial age.Finally, it's more important than ever that students have strong communication, collaboration, and empathy skills. Traditional entrepreneurship tends to invoke ideas of starting a business, but what I am describing goes much further and includes a more personal vision. It is an ability to look at the various parts of your job, and to see any problem that needs solving, to know where you must focus your research and to understand the pieces that you need to put in place in order to solve it. To thrive in an AI world, everyone needs to be this type of entrepreneur, even if they are working for someone else. Schools can make this happen by putting students in the driver's seat more often, using AI tools to better support student mastery of core skills and free up time for student agency and creativity.我们正在进入一个类似于工业革命前的工匠时代。一小群精通工程、销售、市场营销、财务和设计的人，将能够管理大量的生成式 AI，并将所有这些部分整合在一起。当经济学家谈论生产要素时，他们提到资本、劳动力、土地和其他资源（如能源）。但他们也谈到创业。从经济学的角度来看，创业实际上是指如何将资源整合起来创造价值的创造力。那么我们如何让每个学生都具备这种企业家精神呢？第一步是要改变现状。我相信每个人天生都具有高度的创造力和创业精神。然而，工业革命设计的教育系统无意间压制了这两种特质。孩子们习惯于排队坐，保持安静，做笔记。他们被填鸭式教育，必须步调一致地学习。在学术和社交方面，不随大流的行为往往会受到惩罚。当学生进入青年成年期，正是他们最具创造力和创业潜力的时候，系统却用大量的繁重作业压榨了他们追求激情的时间。第二步比较传统。正如比尔·盖茨所说，未来成功的工作者将是那些拥有深厚和广泛技能的人。阅读、写作和算术这三种基本技能比以往任何时候都更为重要。此外，对历史、艺术、科学、法律和金融的深刻理解和欣赏也会使一个人更加全面。幸运的是，我们现在有了技术工具，可以确保学生掌握这些技能，而不必像工业时代那样强制统一学习。最后，比以往任何时候都更重要的是，学生需要具备强大的沟通、合作和同理心技能。传统意义上的创业通常让人想到开办企业，但我所描述的创业远不止如此，还包含了更个人化的愿景。这是一种能够全面审视工作各个部分的能力，识别需要解决的问题，知道研究的重点，并了解需要采取的步骤来解决问题。要在 AI 时代茁壮成长，每个人都需要具备这种创业精神，即使他们在为他人工作。学校可以通过让学生更多地掌控自己的学习过程，使用 AI 工具更好地支持学生掌握核心技能，并腾出时间让学生发挥自主性和创造力来实现这一目标。
