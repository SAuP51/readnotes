Analytic techniques can be grouped into four broad categories based on the nature of the analytic methods used and the type of data that are available (see Figure 1).4 Although each method is distinct, the borders between them can be blurry.Unaided expert judgment often referred to as Traditional Analysis:5 This is the intuitive way most intelligence analysis is done. It includes evidentiary reasoning, most of what is generally considered critical thinking, historical method, case study method, and reasoning by analogy.Structured analysis: Structured techniques externalize the analyst's thinking in a manner that makes it visible to all, thereby enabling it to be reviewed and critiqued piece by piece, or step by step, by the author and by other knowledgeable analysts. Structured analysis is believed to mitigate the adverse impact on analysis of known cognitive limitations and pitfalls.Quasi-quantitative analysis: Analysts often lack the empirical data needed to analyze an intelligence problem and must substitute expert-generated data. This category includes methods such as Bayesian inference, dynamic modeling, and simulation.Empirical analysis: Sufficient empirical data must be available to allow quantitative analysis. Two examples include econometric modeling and data that is collected by sensors to analyze types of weapons systems.Techniques from two or more of these categories will often be used in a single analytic project. For example, a structured analysis tool such as Structured Brainstorming might identify variables to be included in a dynamic model that uses expert-generated data to quantify these variables. Similarly, analysis of a military threat might combine the use of structured analytic techniques to assess motive or intent with a quantitative analysis of capabilities.[1] Some of the material for this and subsequent sections of this paper are taken from "Structured Analytic Techniques, A New Approach to Analysis," by Randolph H. Pherson and Richards J. Heuer, Jr. in Analyzing Intelligence, 2nd Edition, Georgetown University Press, forthcoming.[2] Richards J. Heuer, Jr., Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, Pherson Associates, LLC: Reston, VA. 2007. PDF file downloadable at https://www.cia.gov/csi/books/19104/index.html.

Dawes, Everyday Irrationality (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 2001). Scott Plous, The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making. (New York: McGraw Hill, 1993).[3] The professional judgments in this paragraph are based on the author's personal experience and anecdotal evidence gained in discussion with other experienced analysts. He recognizes that there is a clear need for the Intelligence Community to conduct systematic research on such benefits believed to be gained through the use of structured analytic techniques.[4] This chart was developed by Katherine Hibbs Pherson for use in Globalytica, LLC training materials (www.globalytica.com).[5] The author and Richards J. Heuer, Jr. had difficulty selecting the name for this category. The term "traditional analysis" does not describe the procedural difference between this and the other categories. "Intuitive analysis" was rejected because the definition of intuition implies "without evident rational thought and inference." That certainly does not apply to the way conscious, deliberative analysis is conducted. Expert practitioners of traditional analysis do a great deal of systematic reasoning. "Expert judgment" is a good term for traditional analysis, but it does not distinguish traditional analysis from structured analysis, because structured analysis also relies on expert judgment. The difference is that with structured analysis the reasoning process is externalized more or less in real time, as the reasoning is being conducted. This externalization and systematic procedure is believed to aid the reasoning process and, especially, to help in collaboration with other analysts. That is the basis for the calling the more traditional approach to analysis "unaided" expert judgment.情报分析师使用多种方法来应对不断增长的主题。根据分析方法的性质和可用数据的类型，这些方法可以分为四大类（见图 1）。尽管每种方法都有其独特性，但它们之间的界限可能并不明确。无辅助的专家判断，通常称为传统分析：这是一种大多数情报分析直觉进行的方式。包括证据推理、批判性思维、历史方法、案例研究方法和类比推理。结构化分析：结构化技术将分析师的思维外化，使其对所有人可见，从而能够逐步地被作者和其他有经验的分析师审查和批评。结构化分析被认为可以减轻已知的认知局限和陷阱对分析的负面影响。准定量分析方法：分析师往往缺乏分析情报问题所需的实证数据，因此必须使用专家生成的数据。此类方法包括贝叶斯推理、动态建模和模拟。实证分析方法：需要有足够的实证数据才能进行定量分析。例如，计量经济模型和通过传感器收集的数据可以用来分析武器系统的类型。在一个分析项目中，通常会结合使用多个类别的技术。例如，结构化分析工具如结构化头脑风暴可以识别出需要在动态模型中量化的变量，而这些变量的数据由专家生成。同样，军事威胁的分析可能会结合使用结构化分析技术来评估动机或意图，并对能力进行定量分析。[1] 本文这一节和后续部分的一些材料取自 Randolph H.

Heuer, Jr. 在为这个类别命名时遇到了困难。「传统分析」一词并不能准确描述它与其他类别的程序差异。「直觉分析」被否决了，因为直觉的定义是「没有明显的理性思考和推理」。这显然不适用于有意识的、深思熟虑的分析。传统分析的专家会进行大量的系统推理。「专家判断」是描述传统分析的一个好词，但它无法将传统分析与结构化分析区分开，因为结构化分析也依赖于专家判断。区别在于，结构化分析的推理过程在进行时会或多或少地被外在化。这种外在化和系统化过程被认为有助于推理，尤其是有助于与其他分析师的协作。这就是为什么称更传统的分析方法为「无辅助」专家判断。
