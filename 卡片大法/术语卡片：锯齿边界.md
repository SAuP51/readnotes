Imagine a fortress wall, with some towers and battlements jutting out into the countryside, while others fold back toward the center of the castle. That wall is the capability of AI, and the farther from the center, the harder the task. Everything inside the wall can be done by the AI; everything outside is hard for the AI to do. The problem is that the wall is invisible, so some tasks that might logically seem to be the same distance away from the center, and therefore equally difficult—say, writing a sonnet and an exactly fifty-word poem—are actually on different sides of the wall. The AI is great at the sonnet, but because of how it conceptualizes the world in tokens rather than words, it consistently produces poems of more or less than fifty words. Similarly, some unexpected tasks (like idea generation) are easy for AIs while other tasks that seem to be easy for machines to do (like basic math) are challenges for LLMs. To figure out the shape of the frontier, you will need to experiment.And this experimentation gives you the chance to become the best expert in the world in using AI for a task you know well. The reason for this stems from a fundamental truth about innovation: it is expensive for organizations and companies but cheap for individuals doing their job. Innovation comes from trial and error, which means that an organization trying to launch a new product to help a marketer write more compelling copy would need to build the product, test it on many users, and make changes many times to make something that works. A marketer, however, is writing copy all the time and can experiment with many different ways of using AI to help until they find one that succeeds. No need to hire a team or use expensive software development cycles.As artificial intelligence proliferates, users who intimately understand the nuances, limitations, and abilities of AI tools are uniquely positioned to unlock AI's full innovative potential. These user innovators are often the source of breakthrough ideas for new products and services. And their innovations are often excellent sources for unexpected start-up ideas. Workers who figure out how to make AI useful for their jobs will have a large impact.让这个问题变得更复杂的是我和我的合著者称之为 AI 的「锯齿边界」现象。想象一堵堡垒墙，有些塔楼和防御工事向外突出，而其他则向内缩回。这堵墙代表了 AI 的能力，离中心越远，任务就越困难。墙内的所有任务 AI 都能胜任；墙外的任务则对 AI 来说非常困难。问题在于，这堵墙是看不见的，所以一些看似同样难度的任务，实际上却在墙的不同侧。例如，写一首十四行诗和一首正好五十字的诗，虽然看似一样难，但 AI 擅长写十四行诗，却因为它用 Tokens 而不是单词来理解世界，总是写不出正好五十字的诗。同样，一些意想不到的任务（例如创意生成）对 AI 来说很容易，而一些看似简单的任务（如基础数学）却对大语言模型（LLM）是个挑战。要弄清这条边界的形状，就需要不断进行实验。这种实验让你有机会成为使用 AI 完成你熟悉任务的专家。原因在于一个关于创新的基本事实：对组织和公司来说，创新成本高昂，但对个人来说却很便宜。创新来自试验和错误，这意味着一个公司想推出一款新产品来帮助营销人员写出更有吸引力的文案，需要构建产品、在许多用户上进行测试，并多次修改，才能做出有效的产品。而营销人员自己一直在写文案，可以尝试许多不同的方法来使用 AI，直到找到一种成功的方法。这样就不需要雇佣团队或使用昂贵的软件开发周期。随着人工智能（AI）的广泛应用，那些深刻理解 AI 工具细微差别、局限性和能力的用户，能独特地释放 AI 的全部创新潜力。这些用户创新者往往是新产品和服务突破性想法的重要来源。他们的创意也常常成为意想不到的创业点子。那些学会如何将 AI 应用于工作的人，将产生巨大的影响。
