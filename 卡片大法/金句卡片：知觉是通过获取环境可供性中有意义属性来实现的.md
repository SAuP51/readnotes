Gibson.(1979.2014).2024079The-Ecological-Approach-to-Visual-Perception.Psychology Press => Introduction to the Classic Edition原文：Ralph Norman (1980)wrote the review of Gibson's book in Science. He praised the analysis of the environment and the real world emphasis in the book, but thought that the process of pickup is missing, claiming that Gibson thinks optical structure is automatically picked up if it's there. This has been a common complaint. Gibson rarely did anything to ameliorate such misunder- standings (to the extent that they are misunderstandings). The question of psychological process has to be backed up more than Haber acknowledged, however. That is, a person asking for a psychological processing account needs to consider that goal such a process is meant to perform. Gibson thought that in the end, even though not always admitting it, what people wanted was a "mechanism"to convert a sensation to a perception, and for him, there was no such job to be done. This is so because perceiving involves the detection of information that specifies functionally meaningful properties of the environment (affordances), rather than the conversion of meaningless sensations into a meaningful percept.Ralph Norman（1980）在《Science》杂志上撰写了对 Gibson 书籍的评论。他赞扬了书中对环境和现实世界的分析，但批评书中缺少对信息获取过程的描述。他声称 Gibson 认为只要光学结构存在，人们就能自动获取。这种批评是常见的。Gibson 很少采取措施来缓解这些误解（如果它们真的是误解的话）。心理过程的问题需要比 Haber 所说的更详细的支持。也就是说，提出心理处理需求的人需要考虑这种处理过程的目标。Gibson 认为，尽管他并不总是承认，人们真正想要的是一种将感觉转换为知觉的「机制」，而他认为这种机制根本不存在。因为在他看来，知觉是通过检测环境中功能性有意义的属性（affordances）来实现的，而不是将无意义的感觉转换为有意义的知觉。
