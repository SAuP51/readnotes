However, our examples, mostly based on rational thought and experience, indicate several plausible attributes of knowledge:(1）Knowledge exists;(2）Some, but not all, knowledge comes from rational thought;(3）Some, but not all, knowledge comes from experience;(4）Some knowledge is absolute, while other knowledge is relative to postulates;(5）At least some knowledge is discovered and not created; and(6）Knowledge cannot be established by human proclamation.We apparently need to develop further attributes to prevent the use of inappropriate postulates in rational thought and to identify which experiences yield knowledge. If these attributes exist, then we can hardly maintain the assumption that knowledge is a primitive notion.Due to the infinite variety of life and thought provided by different cultures, I doubt the latter attributes exist. However, I fear that as advancing communication technology homogenizes cultures, formulations of such attributes identifying knowledge will appear plausible, and may enable the creation of totalitarian societies, as depicted in the novels Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and 1984. In short, I fear that what passes for knowledge can and will be both created and destroyed. This certainly seems to be a major goal of some political campaigns.Furthermore, if these latter attributes are found, they would greatly reduce the importance of faith in all its aspects, and generally make life much less interesting and amusing, by removing its diversity. I hope instead that a paraphrase of Mark Twain's observation about religion applies to knowledge：Humankind is the only animal that has the True Knowledge – several of them. If so, a judge of Knowledge is indeed shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods; and hopefully by our laughter as well.我们探讨了几种可能的知识来源，但没有一种是完全令人满意的。不过，通过理性思维和经验的实例，我们可以总结出几种知识的特性：1、知识是存在的。2、有些知识来自理性思维，但不是全部。3、有些知识来自经验，但不是全部。4、有些知识是绝对的，而另一些知识是相对的。5、至少有些知识是被发现的，而不是被创造的。6、知识不能通过人类的宣布来确立。我们显然需要发展新的属性，以防止在理性思维中使用不恰当的假设，并识别哪些经验能够产生知识。如果这些属性确实存在，那么我们很难继续认为知识是一个基本概念。由于不同文化带来了无限多样的生活和思想，我怀疑这些属性是否真的存在。然而，我担心，随着通信技术的发展使文化越来越同质化，识别知识的这些属性可能会显得合理，并可能导致极权社会的出现，就像小说《华氏 451》、《美丽新世界》和《1984》中描绘的那样。简而言之，我担心所谓的知识将会被创造和毁灭。这似乎是一些政治运动的主要目标。此外，如果这些属性被发现，它们将大大减少信仰在各个方面的重要性，并通过消除多样性使生活变得更加单调和乏味。我更希望的是，马克·吐温关于宗教的观察也适用于知识：人类是唯一拥有「真理」的动物 —— 而且有好几种。如果是这样，知识的评判者确实会被神的笑声所打击；也希望会被我们的笑声所打击。
