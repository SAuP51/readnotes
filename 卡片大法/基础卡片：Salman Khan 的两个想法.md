基础卡片：Salman Khan 的两个想法2024-05-16解释：参考：Salman Khan.(2024).2024038Brave-New-Words.Penguin Publishing Group => 0901 Work and What Comes Next原文：Through the years, many people have asked me why I set up Khan Academy as a nonprofit. After all, my previous career was very for-profit, and I live in the middle of Silicon Valley, where scalable tech-enabled solutions can be worth a lot of money. Many have been skeptical whether a nonprofit could even compete with for-profit companies. There were two notions I couldn't get out of my head, however. First, I tend to believe in market forces, but there are a few sectors—namely, education and health care—where the outcomes of market forces don't always align with our values. Education and health care are two areas where our shared values tell us that, ideally, family resources shouldn't be a limiting factor in accessing the best possible opportunities. Most of us believe that every mind and life deserves to reach its full potential.The second notion was more grandiose, if not outright delusional. One of my favorite sets of books is the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. It takes place tens of thousands of years in the future, when humanity has colonized the galaxy, unified under one empire. Within that empire, an academic by the name of Hari Seldon has developed a new field called psychohistory—something of a combination of history, economics, and statistics—that can probabilistically predict large-scale historic trends. This science tells him that the Galactic Empire will enter a ten-thousand-year dark age within the next few hundred years. This will be ten thousand years of war, famine, and lost knowledge. His calculations show that nothing can prevent the coming dark ages, but it can be shortened. So he starts a foundation at the periphery of the galaxy to preserve knowledge and technology, which can then be used to shorten the coming chaos to "only" one thousand years. The book series mainly focuses on how the ensuing hundreds of years actually play out.When I first read the Foundation series in middle school, I found it inspiring to think along those time scales. It was also the first moment I truly appreciated that the strength of a civilization doesn't lie in its physical size, power, and wealth. Those are just by-products of where the real strength lies: a society's culture, know-how, and mindset.Jump ahead to when Khan Academy was beginning, and I realized that very few people in our society think on a scale of more than a few years or decades, much less hundreds or thousands of years. Beyond this, the internet was clearly the transformational technology of our time, but no real institutions were being built with it. I began to wonder whether Khan Academy might just be able to become one of the first of them; something that could help educate billions of people for hundreds of years to come. It would be like Hari Seldon's foundation, except in our case, we could uplift humanity so that the present moment would feel like a dark age when looked back upon from fifty or a hundred years in the future. We only have one life—why not swing for the fences?As Khan Academy grew and scaled from tens to hundreds of millions of people, that dream seemed to feel less and less delusional. Amazing people came out of the woodwork to help us. By the fall of 2009, I had quit my hedge fund job to work on Khan Academy full time. Ten months later, my family was quickly depleting our savings. Our first child was born, and I was having trouble sleeping because of financial stress and, to some degree, the shame of giving up a lucrative job for something that didn't seem to have a future. At what seemed like Khan Academy's darkest moment, Ann Doerr—who is now our chairperson—and John Doerr miraculously showed up and donated enough money for me to keep going. Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have donated to support us. Despite being a nonprofit, we have been able to build a team that rivals those of the most resource-rich tech companies. Hundreds of incredibly talented people have committed a major part of their careers to be part of the Khan Academy team, often taking considerable pay cuts to do so. Thousands of volunteers all over the world have now translated Khan Academy into over fifty languages. Inspirational leaders like Bill Gates, Reed Hastings, and Elon Musk have become some of our biggest supporters and advocates. This journey seems so serendipitous that it has become something of an inside joke among the Khan Academy team that perhaps benevolent aliens are helping us so that, through education, we can prepare humanity for first contact.多年来，很多人问我为什么要把可汗学院（Khan Academy）设立为非营利组织。毕竟，我之前的职业是非常注重盈利的，而且我住在硅谷的核心地带，那里技术解决方案的市场价值很高。很多人怀疑非营利组织能否与盈利公司竞争。然而，我始终有两个想法挥之不去。首先，我相信市场力量，但在某些领域 —— 例如教育和医疗 —— 市场的结果并不总是符合我们的价值观。在这些领域，我们的共同价值观认为，家庭资源不应该限制人们获得最佳机会。我们大多数人都相信，每个人的智慧和生命都应该得到最大的开发。第二个想法更为宏大，甚至有些天马行空。我最喜欢的一套书是 Isaac Asimov 的《基地》系列。故事设定在数万年后的未来，当时人类已经殖民了整个银河系，并在一个帝国的统治下统一。在这个帝国，有个名叫 Hari Seldon 的学者开发了一门新学科，称为心理历史学（psychohistory)，结合了历史、经济学和统计学，能够以概率预测大规模的历史趋势。这门科学告诉他，银河帝国将在未来几百年内进入一个持续一万年的黑暗时代，这将是一个充满战争、饥荒和知识丧失的时期。他的计算表明，虽然无法阻止黑暗时代的到来，但可以缩短它。因此，他在银河系的边缘建立了一个基金会，以保存知识和技术，从而将黑暗时代缩短到「仅仅」一千年。这个系列主要描述了接下来几百年的发展。当我在初中第一次读《基地》系列时，那些宏大的时间尺度令我深受启发。这也是我第一次真正明白，一个文明的强大并不在于它的物理规模、力量和财富。这些只是其真正力量的副产品，而真正的力量在于社会的文化、知识和心态。后来，当可汗学院刚刚起步时，我意识到我们的社会中很少有人能以超过几年甚至几十年的时间尺度去思考，更不用说几百或几千年了。同时，互联网显然是我们这个时代的变革性技术，但却没有真正的机构在利用它。我开始思考，可汗学院是否有可能成为这样的机构之一，成为一个能够在未来数百年间帮助数十亿人接受教育的平台。这就像哈里·谢顿的基地一样，只不过在我们的情况下，我们可以提升整个人类，让五十年或一百年后的世界回顾现在时，会发现现在是一个黑暗的时代。我们只有一次生命，为什么不努力追求卓越呢？随着可汗学院的壮大，从数十人发展到数亿人，这个梦想变得越来越真实。许多杰出的人士纷纷伸出援手。2009 年秋天，我辞去了对冲基金的工作，全职投入到可汗学院。十个月后，我们的积蓄几乎耗尽，第一个孩子也出生了。由于财务压力和放弃高薪工作的羞愧，我常常难以入睡。就在可汗学院最困难的时刻，Ann Doerr（现任主席）和 John Doerr 奇迹般地出现，并捐赠了足够的资金让我继续前行。从那时起，数十万人捐款支持我们。尽管我们是一个非营利组织，但我们组建了一个堪比最富有的科技公司的团队。数百位才华横溢的人士选择将他们职业生涯的重要部分奉献给可汗学院，甚至接受了大幅减薪。全球数千名志愿者已经将可汗学院的内容翻译成五十多种语言。比尔·盖茨、里德·哈斯廷斯和埃隆·马斯克等激励人心的领导者成为了我们的坚定支持者。这段旅程的种种巧合让我们开玩笑说，也许是仁慈的外星人在帮助我们，通过教育为人类的第一次接触做好准备。
