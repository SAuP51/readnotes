Heuer.(2020).2024034Structured-Analytic-Techniques-for-Intelligence-Analysis3Ed.CQ Press => 0301 Choosing the Right Technique原文：Alternative Explanations.When confronted with a new development, the first instinct of a good analyst is to develop a hypothesis to explain what has occurred based on the available evidence and logic. A master thinker goes one step further and immediately asks whether any alternative explanations should be considered. If envisioning one or more alternative explanations is difficult, a master thinker will simply posit a single alternative that the initial or lead hypothesis is not true. Although at first glance these alternatives may appear much less likely, as new evidence surfaces over time, one of the alternatives may evolve into the lead hypothesis. Analysts who do not generate a set of alternative explanations at the start of a project but rather quickly lock on to a preferred explanation will often fall into the trap of Confirmation Bias—focusing on the data that are consistent with their explanation and ignoring or rejecting other data that are inconsistent.替代解释。面对新的情况，优秀的分析师会基于现有证据和逻辑迅速构建一个假设来解释现象。而卓越的思考者则会进一步主动寻找可能的替代解释。如果难以提出多个替代解释，卓越的思考者至少会提出一个反驳主导假设的替代方案。尽管这些替代方案起初看起来可能性不大，但随着新证据的积累，它们中的某一个可能会逐渐成为主导解释。那些在项目初期未能提出一系列替代解释，而是急于确定一个首选解释的分析师，容易陷入确认偏误的误区 —— 他们倾向于关注支持自己解释的数据，而忽视或排斥与之不符的数据。
