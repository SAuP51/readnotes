All analysts should, however, understand the functions performed by various types of techniques and recognize the analytic circumstances in which it is advisable to use them. An analyst can gain this knowledge by reading the introductions to each of the technique chapters and the overviews of each technique. Tradecraft or methodology specialists should be available to assist when needed in the actual implementation of many of these techniques. In the U.S. Intelligence Community, for example, the CIA and several other agencies support the use of these techniques through the creation of analytic tradecraft support cells or mentoring programs.All analysts should be trained to use the core techniques discussed here because they support several of the basic requirements of generating high-quality analysis. They are also widely applicable across many different types of analysis—strategic and tactical, intelligence and law enforcement, and cyber and business. Eight core techniques are described briefly in the following paragraphs.Cluster Brainstorming (chapter 6).A commonly used technique, Cluster Brainstorming (referred to as Structured Brainstorming in previous editions of this book) is a simple exercise employed at the beginning of an analytic project to elicit relevant information or insight from a small group of knowledgeable analysts. The group's goal might be to identify a list of such things as relevant variables, driving forces, a full range of hypotheses, key players or stakeholders, and available evidence or sources of information. Analysts can also use Cluster Brainstorming to explore potential solutions to a problem, potential outcomes or scenarios, or potential responses by an adversary or competitor to some action or situation. Law enforcement analysts can use the technique to brainstorm potential suspects or develop avenues of investigation. Analysts should consider using other silent brainstorming techniques or the Nominal Group Technique ( chapter 6 ) as an alternative to Cluster Brainstorming when there is concern that a senior officer or recognized expert might dominate a regular brainstorming session or that participants may be reluctant to speak up.Key Assumptions Check (chapter 7).One of the most frequently used techniques is the Key Assumptions Check. It requires analysts to explicitly list and question the most important working assumptions underlying their analysis. Any explanation of current events or estimate of future developments requires the interpretation of incomplete, ambiguous, or potentially deceptive evidence. To fill in the gaps, analysts typically make assumptions about such things as the relative strength of political forces, another country's intentions or capabilities, the way governmental processes usually work in that country, the trustworthiness of key sources, the validity of previous analyses on the same subject, or the presence or absence of relevant changes in the context in which the activity is occurring. It is important that analysts explicitly recognize and question their assumptions.Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (chapter 7).This technique requires analysts to start with a full set of plausible hypotheses rather than with a single most likely hypothesis. Analysts then take each item of relevant information, one at a time, and judge its consistency or inconsistency with each hypothesis. The idea is to refute hypotheses rather than confirm them. The most likely hypothesis is the one with the least inconsistent information that would argue against it, not the one with the most relevant information that supports it. This process applies a key element of the scientific method to intelligence analysis.Premortem Analysis and Structured Self-Critique (chapter 8).This pair of easy-to-use techniques enables a small team of analysts who have been working together on any type of analysis to challenge effectively the accuracy of its own conclusions. Premortem Analysis uses a form of reframing, in which restating the question or problem from another perspective enables one to see it in a different way and formulate different answers. For example, analysts could place themselves months or years in the future and imagine that they suddenly learn from an unimpeachable source that their original estimate was wrong. Then imagine what could have happened to cause the estimate to be wrong. Looking back to explain something that has happened is much easier than looking into the future to forecast what will happen.With the Structured Self-Critique, analysts respond to a list of questions about a variety of factors, including sources of uncertainty, analytic processes, critical assumptions, diagnosticity of evidence, information gaps, and the potential for deception. Rigorous use of both techniques can help prevent a future need for a postmortem.What If? Analysis (chapter 8).In conducting a What If? Analysis, one imagines that an unexpected event has happened and then, with the benefit of "hindsight," analyzes how it could have come about and considers the potential consequences. This reframing approach creates an awareness that prepares the analyst's mind to recognize early signs of a significant change. It can also enable decision makers to plan for contingencies. In addition, a What If? Analysis can be a tactful way of alerting a decision maker to the possibility that he or she may be wrong.Multiple Scenarios Generation (chapter 9).One of the most commonly used Foresight analysis techniques, Multiple Scenarios Generation, uses key drivers in a 2-×-2 matrix to generate multiple explanations for how a situation may develop when considerable uncertainty is present. The technique leverages the knowledge and imagination of a diverse group of experts to identify alternative future trajectories that both warn decision makers of downside risks and illuminate new opportunities.Indicators Generation, Validation, and Evaluation (chapter 9).Indicators are observable actions or events that can be generated using a variety of structured techniques. They can be monitored to detect or anticipate change. For example, analysts can use Indicators to measure changes toward an undesirable condition, such as political instability, a pending financial crisis, or a coming attack. Indicators can also point toward a desirable condition, such as economic reform or democratic institution building. The special value of Indicators is that they create an awareness that prepares an analyst's mind to recognize the earliest signs of significant change that might otherwise be overlooked. Indicators must be validated, and the Indicators Evaluation process helps analysts assess the diagnostic value of their Indicators.3.2 核心技术不要求普通分析师掌握本书中的每一种技术。然而，所有分析师都应了解各类技术所执行的功能，并识别在哪些分析情况下应用这些技术是恰当的。分析师可以通过阅读每个技术章节的引言和每种技术的概述来获得这种知识。在实际应用这些技术时，分析方法或技术专家应提供必要的协助。例如，在美国情报界，中央情报局和其他几个机构通过创建分析贸易支持单元或辅导计划来支持这些技术的使用。所有分析师都应学习本文介绍的核心技术，因为这些技术对于生成高质量分析至关重要，并且适用于多种分析领域，包括战略与战术分析、情报与执法分析、以及网络与商业分析。以下是对八种核心技术的简要描述。集群头脑风暴（第 6 章）。这是一种广泛应用的技术，集群头脑风暴（在本书早期版本中称为结构化头脑风暴）是一种在分析项目初期使用的简单方法，旨在从一组经验丰富的分析师中收集相关信息和洞察。小组的任务可能包括识别关键变量、主要驱动力、全面的假设、重要参与者或利益相关者，以及可用的证据或信息来源。此外，分析师可以利用集群头脑风暴来探索问题解决方案、预测可能的结果或情景，以及预测对手或竞争者对特定行动或情况的反应。执法分析师可以使用这种方法来生成嫌疑人名单或制定调查策略。当担心高级官员或专家可能会在传统头脑风暴会议中占据主导地位，或者参与者可能不愿意表达意见时，分析师可以考虑使用无声头脑风暴技术或名义小组技术（第 6 章）作为集群头脑风暴的替代方法。关键假设检查（第 7 章）。最常用的技术之一是关键假设检查。这项技术要求分析师明确列出并质疑其分析中最重要的假设。在解释当前事件或预测未来发展时，分析师需要处理不完整、模糊或可能具有欺骗性的证据。为了填补这些信息上的空白，分析师会做出一系列假设，例如政治力量的相对强度、其他国家的意图或能力、该国政府工作流程的常规方式、关键信息来源的可信度、先前对同一主题分析的有效性，以及活动发生环境中相关变化的存在与否。明确识别并质疑这些假设对于分析师来说至关重要。竞争性假设分析（第 7 章）是一种技术，它要求分析师从一组合理的假设开始，而不是仅关注一个最可能的假设。分析师会逐一评估每条相关信息与每个假设的一致性或不一致性。这种方法的目的是反驳假设，而不是仅仅确认它们。最可能的假设是那些最少有信息与之相矛盾的假设，而不是那些有最多信息支持的假设。这种方法将科学方法中的一个关键原则应用于情报分析。事后分析和结构化自我批评（第 8 章）是另外两种分析技术，它们帮助分析师在分析过程中识别和纠正潜在的偏见和错误。这一对简单实用的技术，让一个小型的分析师团队能够有效地挑战他们自身结论的准确性，无论他们正在从事哪种类型的分析。预后分析（Premortem Analysis）采用了一种重构框架的技巧，通过从不同的视角重新审视问题，帮助分析师以全新的眼光看待问题，并提出不同的解决方案。例如，分析师可以设想自己处于未来，突然得知最初的预测出现了偏差。然后，他们会思考可能导致这一偏差的各种因素。回顾过去发生的事情，总是比预测未来要简单得多。通过结构化自我批评（Structured Self-Critique），分析师会回答一系列关于各种因素的问题，这些问题涵盖了不确定性的来源、分析过程、关键假设、证据的有效性、信息缺口以及可能存在的欺骗行为。严格运用这两种技术，可以有效避免未来需要进行事后分析的情况。假设分析（第 8 章）。在进行假设分析时，分析师会设想一个意外事件已经发生，然后利用「事后诸葛亮」的视角，分析这一事件可能如何发生，并评估其潜在影响。这种重构框架的方法能够提高分析师对重大变化早期迹象的敏感度，同时也帮助决策者为可能出现的意外情况做好准备。此外，假设分析还可以作为一种委婉的方式，提醒决策者他们可能存在的判断失误。多场景生成（第 9 章）。多情景生成是一种广泛应用的预测分析方法，它通过构建 2×2 矩阵中的关键因素来描绘多种可能的未来发展路径。这种方法汇集了来自各行各业专家的智慧和创意，旨在为决策者揭示潜在的风险，并发现新的机遇。指标生成、验证和评估（第 9 章）。指标是可观察的行为或事件，可以通过多种方法产生。它们可以被用来监测和预测变化。例如，分析人员可以利用指标来衡量向不利状态（如政治动荡、即将到来的金融危机或潜在的攻击）的转变。同样，指标也可以指示向有利状态的转变，例如经济改革或民主制度的建立。指标的独特之处在于，它们能够提高分析人员的警觉性，帮助他们捕捉到那些容易被忽略的重要变化的早期信号。为了确保指标的有效性，需要对其进行验证，而指标评估过程则是帮助分析人员评估指标的准确性和有用性的关键步骤。
