基础卡片：AI 可以帮人摆脱思维偏见2024-06-05解释：参考：Ethan Mollick.(2024).2024029Co-Intelligence_Living-and-Working-with-AI.Penguin Publishing Group => 0301 Four Rules for Co-Intelligence原文：And AI can be very useful. Not just for job tasks, as we will discuss in detail in the coming chapters, but also because an alien perspective can be helpful. Humans are subject to all sorts of biases that impact our decision-making. But many of these biases come from our being stuck in our own minds. Now we have another (strange, artificial) co-intelligence we can turn to for help. AI can assist us as a thinking companion to improve our own decision-making, helping us reflect on our own choices (rather than simply relying on the AI to make choices for us). We are in a world where human decision-making skills can be easily augmented in a new way.Even if you scoff at the idea that AI-generated text could be persuasive and motivational, I have found this to be the case. I wrote this book on a compressed timeline, on top of other responsibilities to my family, students, collaborators, and university. It was hard to get started, but I knew that one thing that was holding me back was status quo bias, the urge to avoid making changes even when they might be good. To overcome this bias, it helps to consider what you are losing as a result of not acting. AI is surprisingly good at this, as you can see when I prompted it by saying, I was thinking of writing a book about generative AI, but I am very busy and don't think I want to make such a large commitment. Can you reframe my failure to write a book as a loss rather than a default option? Make the framing vivid.In a world brimming with knowledge, you stood at the precipice of innovation, holding the torch of understanding about generative AI. Yet, when the world looked to you for illumination, the torch remained unlit. Not because the world wasn't ready, but because you let the whispers of business snuff out its flame. It wasn't the world's loss; it was yours.Yikes, I guess I should finish writing this book. That's a pretty great reframing of the failure as a loss, and suggests one way we can start using AI is to explore how to help ourselves, both professionally and personally. The strengths and weaknesses of AI may not mirror your own, and that's an asset. This diversity in thought and approach can lead to innovative solutions and ideas that might never occur to a human mind.AI 的用处远不止于工作任务（我们将在后续章节详细讨论），还因为它提供了一种全新的视角。人类在决策时会受到各种偏见的影响，因为我们常常困在自己的思维中。而现在，我们有了一个（奇特的、人工的）共同智能可以依靠。AI 可以作为一个思考伙伴，帮助我们改进决策，反思自己的选择（而不是单纯依赖 AI 来做决定）。我们正处于一个人类决策能力可以轻松增强的新时代。即使你对 AI 生成的文本具有说服力和激励作用持怀疑态度，我发现实际情况确实如此。我在紧迫的时间内完成了这本书，同时还要兼顾家庭、学生、合作伙伴和学校的其他责任。开始确实很难，但我知道阻碍我前进的是「现状偏见」，即即使知道改变可能是好的，也倾向于保持现状。要克服这种偏见，考虑不行动所带来的损失是有帮助的。AI 在这方面表现出色。比如，当我告诉 AI，我在考虑写一本关于生成式 AI（Generative AI）的书，但我太忙了，不想做出这么大的承诺。你能把我不写书的失败重新框架成一种损失而不是默认选项吗？请把描述生动一些。在知识丰富的世界里，你站在创新的前沿，原本握有关于生成式 AI（Generative AI）的宝贵理解。然而，当世界期待你点亮这盏指路明灯时，它却没有燃烧起来。这并不是因为世界还未准备好，而是因为你让商业的低语熄灭了它。这不是世界的损失，而是你的损失。看来我真的该完成这本书的写作了。这种将失败重构为损失的表达非常有意义，并且建议我们可以开始使用 AI 来探索如何在专业和个人生活中帮助自己。AI 的优点和缺点可能并不完全与你的相同，这反而是一种优势。这种思维和方法的多样性可以带来创新的解决方案和想法，这些想法可能从未出现在人类的脑海中。
