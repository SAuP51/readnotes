Some philosophers, rationalists such as Baruch Spinoza（1632-1677）and Gottfried Leibniz（1646-1716), argued that one can deduce all possible knowledge from a suitable set of axioms; other philosophers, empiricists such as John Locke（1632-1704）and David Hume（1711-1776), argued that knowledge comes solely from experience of the world. Most philosophers fall in the gap between these two extremes, by arguing that both reason and experience are necessary for knowledge. In short, a major portion of Western philosophy is based on the premise that knowledge follows either from rational thought, experience, or from a combination of the two.在西方，知识常常被视为理性思考的结果 —— 这个观点已经被哲学家们争论了几个世纪。一些理性主义哲学家，如 Baruch Spinoza（1632-1677）和 Gottfried Leibniz（1646-1716），认为所有知识都可以从一组合适的公理中推导出来；而经验主义哲学家，如 John Locke（1632-1704）和 David Hume（1711-1776），则认为知识完全来自于对世界的经验。大多数哲学家介于这两者之间，认为理性和经验都是知识必不可少的。简而言之，西方哲学主要认为知识要么来自理性思考，要么来自经验，或者是两者的结合。
