We answer that it does not. In particular, Shannon information requires that a prestated probability distribution (frequency interpreted) be well stated concerning the message ensemble, from which its entropy can be computed. But if Darwinian preadaptations cannot be prestated, then the entropy calculation cannot be carried out ahead of time with respect to the distribution of features of organisms in the biosphere. This, we believe, is a sufficient condition to state that Shannon information does not describe the information content in the evolution of the biosphere.There are further difficulties with Shannon information and the evolving biosphere. What might constitute the "Source"? Start at the origin of life, or the last common ancestor. What is the source of something like "messages" that are being transmitted in the process of evolution from that Source? The answer is entirely unclear. Further, what is the transmission channel? Contemporary terrestrial life is based on DNA, RNA, and proteins via the genetic code. It is insufficient to state that the channel is the transmission of DNA from one generation to the next. Instead, one would have to say that the actual "channel" involves successive life cycles of whole organisms. For sexual organisms this involves the generation of the zygote, the development of the adult from that zygote, the pairing of that adult with a mate, and a further life cycle. Hence, part of one answer to what the "channel" might be is that the fertilized egg is a channel with the Shannon information to yield the subsequent adult. But it has turned out that even if all orientations of all molecules in the zygote were utilized, there is not enough information capacity to store the information to yield the adult. This move was countered by noting that, if anything, development is rather more like an algorithm than an information channel (Apter and Wolpert 1965). In short, a channel to transmit Shannon information along life cycles does not exist, so again, Shannon information does not seem to apply to the biosphere.It seems central to point out that the evolution of the biosphere is not the transmission of information down some channel from some source, but rather the persistent, ongoing, co-construction, via propagating organization, heritable variation, and natural selection, of the collective biosphere. Propagating organization requires work. It is important to note that Shannon ignored the work requirements to transmit "abstract" information, although it might be argued that the concept of constraints is implicit in the restrictions on the messages at the Source. While we mention this, we have no clear understanding physically of what such constraints are.One might be tempted to argue that a Shannon-like information theory could be applied to the vast set of selective events that have led to the specific DNA sequences that are in contemporary organisms. But does this move work? Can we specify a finite ensemble of possible DNA sequences out of which the present DNA sequences have been derived? If we consider all DNA sequences longer than, say 1,000 nucleotides, it would take vastly large repetitions of the history of the universe for the universe to construct one copy of each possibility. This cannot physically constitute the ensemble. Is the ensemble the set of DNA sequences that have been explored in the actual evolution of the biosphere, some accepted, most rejected? This approach initially seems promising, but has the obvious difficulty that we cannot specify the ensemble explored in 3.8 billion years, hence do not and cannot know the Shannon information content of the biosphere. A further difficulty with this approach is that it measures the information content of the biosphere as a function of the number of DNA sequences "tried" in evolution. But very different numbers of attempted mutations might have led to the same biosphere, hence quantitating the information of the biosphere by the number of attempted DNA mutations is not in direct correspondence to any specific biosphere.We conclude that a Shannon Information content analysis of the information content of the evolving biosphere is not legitimate.现在我们来探讨香农信息是否适用于生物圈的进化。我们的答案是否定的。具体来说，香农信息要求对消息集合的概率分布进行预先声明（按频率解释），以便计算其熵。但是，如果达尔文的预适应性不能预先声明，那么就无法提前计算生物圈中生物特征分布的熵。我们认为，这足以说明香农信息不能描述生物圈进化中的信息内容。香农信息理论在解释生物圈的进化过程中遇到了一些困难。首先，什么可以被定义为「源」？是生命的起源，还是最后的共同祖先？在进化过程中，类似于「信息」的东西是从哪里传递出来的？这个问题目前还没有明确的答案。其次，传输通道是什么呢？我们知道，当代地球上的生命是通过遗传密码中的 DNA、RNA 和蛋白质进行信息传递的。但仅仅说 DNA 从一代传递到下一代作为通道是不够的。实际上，整个生物体的连续生命周期才是实际的「通道」。对于有性生殖的生物，这个过程包括受精卵的形成、受精卵发育成成体、成体与配偶的配对及其后续的生命周期。因此，可以说，受精卵是作为通道，携带着产生后续成体的香农信息。然而，研究发现，即使利用受精卵中所有分子的所有取向，信息容量仍不足以存储生成成体所需的全部信息。有人指出，发育过程更像是一个算法，而不是一个信息通道（Apter 和 Wolpert 1965)。总之，在生命周期中传输香农信息的通道并不存在，因此，香农信息理论似乎并不适用于解释生物圈。似乎有必要指出，生物圈的进化并不是通过某个渠道从某个源头传递信息，而是通过传播组织、可遗传变异和自然选择的方式，持续进行的共同构建。传播组织需要耗费能量。需要注意的是，Shannon 忽略了传输「抽象」信息所需的能量，尽管可以说约束的概念在源头消息的限制中是隐含的。尽管我们提到这一点，但我们对这种约束在物理上究竟是什么并没有明确的理解。有人可能会主张，香农信息理论可以应用于导致当代生物体中特定 DNA 序列的大量选择事件。但这种方法是否有效呢？我们能否指定一个有限的可能 DNA 序列集，从中推导出现有的 DNA 序列？如果我们考虑所有长度超过 1,000 个核苷酸的 DNA 序列，宇宙需要重复极多次才能构建每种可能性的一个副本。这在物理上是不可能的。集合是否是实际进化过程中探索过的 DNA 序列集，其中一些被接受，大多数被拒绝？这种方法乍看起来很有前途，但明显的困难在于我们无法指定在 38 亿年中探索的集合，因此无法知道生物圈的香农信息内容。此方法的另一个困难在于，它将生物圈的信息内容衡量为进化过程中尝试过的 DNA 序列的数量。但非常不同数量的尝试突变可能导致相同的生物圈，因此通过尝试的 DNA 突变数量来量化生物圈的信息与任何特定生物圈不直接对应。我们得出结论，使用香农信息理论分析进化生物圈的信息内容是不恰当的。
