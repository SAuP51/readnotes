Not their attitudes about change or commitment to continuous improvement; they really wanted to work more effectively. Rather, the key factor is the way they reasoned about their behavior and that of others.It is impossible to reason anew in every situation. If we had to think through all the possible responses every time someone asked, “How are you?” the world would pass us by. Therefore, everyone develops a theory of action—a set of rules that individuals use to design and implement their own behavior as well as to understand the behavior of others. Usually, these theories of actions become so taken for granted that people don’t even realize they are using them.One of the paradoxes of human behavior, however, is that the master program people actually use is rarely the one they think they use. Ask people in an interview or questionnaire to articulate the rules they use to govern their actions, and they will give you what I call their “espoused” theory of action. But observe these same people’s behavior, and you will quickly see that this espoused theory has very little to do with how they actually behave. For example, the professionals on the case team said they believed in continuous improvement, and yet they consistently acted in ways that made improvement impossible.防御性推理与恶性循环引发专业人士防御性的并非他们对变革的态度或持续改进的承诺；他们确实希望更高效地工作。关键在于他们如何推理自己及他人的行为。在每种情况下都进行全新的推理是不现实的。如果每次别人问我们「你好吗？」时我们都要思考所有可能的回答，我们就会错失生活中的很多事情。因此，每个人都会形成一套行动理论 —— 这是一组规则，用于指导个人设计和执行自己的行为，并理解他人的行为。这些行动理论通常被视为理所当然，以至于人们甚至没有意识到自己在使用它们。然而，人类行为的一个悖论是，人们实际采用的主程序很少是他们认为自己在使用的那个。如果你让人们在面试或问卷中描述他们用来指导行为的规则，他们会给出他们所声称的行动理论。但是，如果你观察这些人的实际行为，你会很快发现，他们所声称的理论与他们的实际行为关系不大。例如，案例团队中的专业人士声称他们信奉持续改进，然而他们的实际行为却一再显示出阻碍改进的态度。When you observe people’s behavior and try to come up with rules that would make sense of it, you discover a very different theory of action—what I call the individual’s “theory-in-use.” Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently, unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use, between the way they think they are acting and the way they really act.What’s more, most theories-in-use rest on the same set of governing values. There seems to be a universal human tendency to design one’s actions consistently according to four basic values:To remain in unilateral control;To maximize “winning” and minimize “losing”;To suppress negative feelings; andTo be as “rational” as possible—by which people mean defining clear objectives and evaluating their behavior in terms of whether or not they have achieved them.The purpose of all these values is to avoid embarrassment or threat, feeling vulnerable or incompetent. In this respect, the master program that most people use is profoundly defensive. Defensive reasoning encourages individuals to keep private the premises, inferences, and conclusions that shape their behavior and to avoid testing them in a truly independent, objective fashion.Because the attributions that go into defensive reasoning are never really tested, it is a closed loop, remarkably impervious to conflicting points of view. The inevitable response to the observation that somebody is reasoning defensively is yet more defensive reasoning. With the case team, for example, whenever anyone pointed out the professionals’ defensive behavior to them, their initial reaction was to look for the cause in somebody else—clients who were so sensitive that they would have been alienated if the consultants had criticized them or a manager so weak that he couldn’t have taken it had the consultants raised their concerns with him. In other words, the case team members once again denied their own responsibility by externalizing the problem and putting it on someone else.当我们观察人们的行为并尝试找出其背后的规律时，我们会发现一种完全不同的行为理论 —— 即我所说的「实际应用理论」。简单来说，人们的行为常常是自相矛盾的，他们没有察觉到自己表面上声称的理论与实际应用中的理论之间，以及他们以为的行为方式与实际行为方式之间的差异。更进一步，大多数实际应用的理论都基于相同的核心价值观。人们似乎普遍倾向于根据以下四个基本价值观来设计自己的行动：保持绝对的控制权；尽可能赢得胜利，避免失败；抑制消极情绪；力求合理 —— 即明确目标，并根据是否达成这些目标来评估自己的行为。所有这些价值观的根本目的是为了避免尴尬或威胁，防止自己感觉脆弱或无能。在这方面，大多数人所遵循的主要程序具有深刻的防御性。防御性思维鼓励个体隐藏影响其行为的假设、推理和结论，避免在真正独立和客观的场合中进行验证。由于防御性思维中的假设从未真正接受检验，它形成了一个封闭的循环，对于不同的观点几乎完全封闭。当观察到某人采用防御性思维时，他们通常会用更多的防御性思维来回应。例如，在案例小组中，当有人指出专业人士的防御性行为时，他们首先会把原因归咎于其他人 —— 比如客户太敏感，批评会让他们感到不适，或者经理太无力，无法接受批评。换言之，小组成员再次通过将问题外化并归咎于别人，来回避自身的责任。
