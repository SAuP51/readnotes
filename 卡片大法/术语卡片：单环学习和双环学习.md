What’s more, those members of the organization that many assume to be the best at learning are, in fact, not very good at it. I am talking about the well-educated, high-powered, high-commitment professionals who occupy key leadership positions in the modern corporation.Most companies not only have tremendous difficulty addressing this learning dilemma; they aren’t even aware that it exists. The reason: they misunderstand what learning is and how to bring it about. As a result, they tend to make two mistakes in their efforts to become a learning organization.First, most people define learning too narrowly as mere “problem solving,” so they focus on identifying and correcting errors in the external environment. Solving problems is important. But if learning is to persist, managers and employees must also look inward. They need to reflect critically on their own behavior, identify the ways they often inadvertently contribute to the organization’s problems, and then change how they act. In particular, they must learn how the very way they go about defining and solving problems can be a source of problems in its own right.I have coined the terms “single loop” and “double loop” learning to capture this crucial distinction. To give a simple analogy: a thermostat that automatically turns on the heat whenever the temperature in a room drops below 68 degrees is a good example of single-loop learning. A thermostat that could ask, “Why am I set at 68 degrees?” and then explore whether or not some other temperature might more economically achieve the goal of heating the room would be engaging in double-loop learning.Highly skilled professionals are frequently very good at single-loop learning. After all, they have spent much of their lives acquiring academic credentials, mastering one or a number of intellectual disciplines, and applying those disciplines to solve real-world problems. But ironically, this very fact helps explain why professionals are often so bad at double-loop learning.Put simply, because many professionals are almost always successful at what they do, they rarely experience failure. And because they have rarely failed, they have never learned how to learn from failure. So whenever their single-loop learning strategies go wrong, they become defensive, screen out criticism, and put the “blame” on anyone and everyone but themselves. In short, their ability to learn shuts down precisely at the moment they need it the most.The propensity among professionals to behave defensively helps shed light on the second mistake that companies make about learning. The common assumption is that getting people to learn is largely a matter of motivation. When people have the right attitudes and commitment, learning automatically follows. So companies focus on creating new organizational structures—compensation programs, performance reviews, corporate cultures, and the like—that are designed to create motivated and committed employees.任何渴望在 1990 年代竞争激烈的商业环境中脱颖而出的公司，首先必须面对一个根本的挑战：市场的成功越来越依赖于持续学习，但大多数人并不擅长学习。更具讽刺意味的是，那些通常被认为学习能力最强的组织成员，实际上并没有表现出足够的学习能力。这些人是那些受过高等教育、才华横溢且极具责任心的专业人员，他们在现代企业中担任关键领导角色。不仅大多数公司在解决这种学习难题时感到力不从心，他们甚至没有意识到这个问题的存在。这是因为他们对学习的理解有误，不知道如何有效地促进学习。因此，他们在努力打造学习型组织的过程中通常会犯两个错误。首先，许多人对学习的定义过于狭窄，仅将其视为「解决问题」，因此他们专注于找出并修正外部环境中的错误。虽然解决问题很关键，但要实现持续的学习，管理层和员工还需要反观自身。他们应当深入反思自己的行为，找出自己在不知不觉中是如何加剧组织问题的，并据此改变自己的行为模式。尤其重要的是，他们需要认识到，他们处理问题的方式本身就可能是问题的一部分。为了描述这种区分，我特别提出了「单环学习」和「双环学习」这两个概念。以一个简单的类比来说明：一个室温低于 68 度时自动启动暖气的恒温器就是单环学习的典范。而一个能够自问「我为什么要设置在 68 度？」并探索是否有其他更节能的温度设置能达到相同的加热效果的恒温器，则是在进行双环学习。高技能的专业人员通常在单环学习上表现出色，这主要是因为他们花费了大量时间获取学术资格，掌握各种智力学科，并将这些学科知识应用于解决现实问题。然而，讽刺的是，正是因为他们在这些领域的成就，让他们在双环学习上的表现通常不尽如人意。简而言之，因为这些专业人士几乎总能在他们的领域内取得成功，他们很少面对失败。而不熟悉失败的经历意味着他们未曾学会从失败中吸取教训。所以，当他们依赖的单环学习策略出现问题时，他们往往会本能地采取防御态度，拒绝接受批评，并将责任推给其他人。总的来说，正当他们最需要学习的时刻，他们的学习能力却戛然而止。这种专业人士的防御性行为揭示了许多公司在推动学习进程中的另一个误区。人们常常认为，激发学习的关键在于动机。当员工持有正确的态度和承诺时，学习似乎就会自然发生。因此，许多公司侧重于构建能激励员工的新组织结构，如薪酬体系、绩效评价和企业文化等，希望通过这些措施培养员工的积极性和忠诚度。
