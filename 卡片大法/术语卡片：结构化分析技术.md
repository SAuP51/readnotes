Heuer.(2020).2024034Structured-Analytic-Techniques-for-Intelligence-Analysis3Ed.CQ Press => 0101 Introduction and Overview原文：1.1 Our VisionThis book defines the role and scope of Structured Analytic Techniques as a distinct analytic approach that provides a step-by-step process for dealing with the kinds of incomplete, ambiguous, and sometimes deceptive information with which analysts must work. Structured analysis is a mechanism by which internal thought processes are externalized in a systematic and transparent manner so that they can be shared, built on, and easily critiqued by others. Each technique leaves a trail that other analysts and managers can follow to see the basis for an analytic judgment. These techniques are used by individual analysts but are perhaps best utilized in a collaborative team effort in which each step of the analytic process exposes participants to divergent or conflicting perspectives. This transparency helps ensure that differences of opinion among analysts are heard and seriously considered early in the analytic process. Analysts tell us that this is one of the most valuable benefits of any structured technique.Structured analysis helps analysts ensure that their analytic framework—the foundation upon which they form their analytic judgments—is as solid as possible. By helping break down a specific analytic problem into its component parts and specifying a step-by-step process for handling these parts, Structured Analytic Techniques help organize the amorphous mass of data with which most analysts must contend. Such techniques make our thinking more open and available for review and critique by ourselves as well as by others. This transparency enables the effective communication at the working level that is essential for intraoffice and interagency collaboration.We call the various approaches described in this book "techniques" because they usually guide the analyst in thinking about a problem rather than provide the analyst with a definitive answer, as one might expect from a predictive tool. Structured techniques help analysts think more rigorously about a problem; they do not solve it. Structured Analytic Techniques, however, do form a methodology—a set of principles and procedures for qualitative analysis of the kinds of uncertainties that many analysts must deal with daily.1.1 我们的愿景本书阐述了结构化分析技术的作用和应用领域，将其作为一种特殊的分析手段，提供了一套处理分析师日常工作中遇到的不完整、模糊甚至带有误导性的信息的系统化方法。结构化分析是一种将内在思考过程以有条理且透明的方式展现出来的机制，使得这些思考可以被共享、进一步发展，并且容易受到他人的评价和批评。每种分析技术都会留下可供追踪的痕迹，让其他分析师和管理者能够理解分析判断的依据。这些技术虽然可以由个人分析师独立使用，但在团队协作中发挥最佳效果，因为在团队中，分析过程的每一步都能让成员接触到不同的或对立的观点。这种透明度确保了分析师之间的不同意见能够被及时听取并在分析过程的早期得到认真考虑。分析师们认为，这是结构化分析技术带来的最重要的好处之一。结构化分析帮助分析师构建一个坚固的分析框架 —— 这是他们做出分析判断的基础。通过将特定的分析问题分解成各个部分，并制定出处理这些部分的详细步骤，结构化分析技术帮助分析师整理和处理他们面对的大量数据。这些技术让我们的思考更加公开，便于自我反思和他人的审查与批评。这种透明度促进了工作层面的有效沟通，这对于办公室内部和不同机构之间的合作至关重要。我们称本书中描述的各种方法为「技术」，因为它们通常引导分析师深入思考问题，而不是直接提供一个确定的答案。这些结构化技术帮助分析师以更加严谨的方式思考问题，但它们并不直接解决问题。结构化分析技术实际上是一种方法论，它提供了一套原则和程序，用于定性分析许多分析师在日常工作中必须面对的不确定性。
