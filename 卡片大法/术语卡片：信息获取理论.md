Gibson.(1979.2014).2024079The-Ecological-Approach-to-Visual-Perception.Psychology Press => Introduction to the Classic Edition原文：After presenting the major features of his theory and the supporting evid- ence in the first 13 chapters, Gibson lists the highlights of his position in Chapter 14, "The Theory of Information Pickup and its Consequences."He states that "The theory of information pickup differs radically from the tradi- tional theories of perception" and follows with several distinctive features of the theory. These features include: "a new notion of perception, not just a new theory of the process; ""a new assumption about what there is to be perceived;" "a new conception of the information for perception, with two kinds always available, one about the environment and another about the self:""the new assumption of perceptual systems; and optical information pickup [that] entails an activity of the system not heretofore imagined by any visual scientist, the concurrent registering of both persistence and change in the flow of structured stimulation." With respect to the later, he notes that "this is the crux of the theory."Each of these distinctive qualities of Gibson's theory is discussed extensively in the book. I will stress the first point here and leave the others for the reader. I stress the first one because, in my experience, it has not been as widely appreciated as some of the others,.Succinct expressions of the "new notion of perception" can be found in the next subsection of Chapter 14, "A redefinition of perception," and later in the same chapter in the Section called "A new approach to nonperceptual aware- ness"where he again characterizes what he means by perception in order to show that it forces a re-thinking of other putative processes like memory. thinking, and imagining. Under "A redefinition of perception"he writes, "Perceiving is an achievement of the individual, not an experience in the theatre of consciousness. It is a keeping-in-touch with the world, an experiencing of things rather than a having of experiences. "The act of picking up informa- tion, moreover, is a continuous act, an activity that is ceaseless and unbroken. 'The continuous act of perceiving involves the coperceiving of the self."Then, later in the chapter, he writes, "To perceive is to be aware of the surfaces of the environment and of oneself in it. The interchange between hidden and unhidden surfaces is essential to this awareness. These are existing surfaces; they are specified at some points of observation. Perceiving gets wider and finer and longer and richer and fuller as the observer explores the environ- ment. The full awareness of surfaces includes their layout, their substances, their events. and their affordances. Note how this definition includes within perception a part of memory, expectation, knowledge, and meaning-some part but not all of those mental processes in each case."Being in direct perceptual contact with the environment is contrasted with being in direct perceptual contact with something that mediates between the animal and environment. As Gibson says at the beginning of Chapter 9, "Direct perception is what one gets from seeing Niagara Falls, say, as distinguished from seeing a picture of it." Sometimes it is asserted that in Gibson's sense of direct perception, perceiving is accurate. While true in a sense, it also can be misleading. The environment is indefinitely rich. No animal can perceive beyond a small fraction of it, so "perceiving the environment"cannot possibly mean perceiving all of it. Thus Gibson said that "Perceiving gets wider and finer and longer and richer and fuller as the observer explores the environment." Being "in touch with" or "aware of" means being able to guide one's activity to formulate goals and accomplish them.In the section, "The relationship between imagining and perceiving" in Chapter 14. Gibson lists perceptual tests for reality. These are crucial to under- standing Gibson's claims for the fidelity of optical structure. He illustrates by showing the difference between the optical structure of an image and the optical structure of substantial, persisting, surfaces in the world. First, consider accom- modation of the lens in a mammalian eye. Accommodation clarifies texture on real surfaces, not images. Second, surfaces become clearer with fixation. Third. a surface can be scanned (as opposed to an image). Fourth, an object can be scrutinized. Indeed, Gibson says, "The most decisive test for reality is whether you can discover new features and details by the act of scrutiny. Can you obtain new stimulation and extract new information from it? Is the information inex- haustible? Is there more to be seen? The imaginary scrutiny of an imaginary entity cannot pass the test."He adds, "A related criterion for the existence of a thing is reversible occlusion. Whatever goes out of sight as you move your head and comes into sight as you move back is a persisting surface."Thus, perception of the environment consisting of substantial surfaces, as opposed to any surrogate, can be direct because the change and associated non- change is distinct from anything non-real.The last point I want to make about this book is the persistent contact with research findings. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 are set aside to review relevant research findings. Because Gibson offered a broad, comprehensive theory, comment- ators have sometimes neglected the degree to which Gibson was concerned with accounting for research results. He often claimed to have formulated or changed an idea because of findings he was trying to understand A good example comes from prism studies. He was always challenged to interpret che results of people like Stratton and Ivo Kohler whose observers adjusted to extraordinary optical transformations over periods of hours, days, and weeks. Stratton's apparatus had people looking at the world "upside down." Where many psychologists draw the lesson of brain plasticity from such studies, Gibson asked what it was that prism wearers (for example) were adjusting to. He realized at some level of abstraction that there had to be information for the stability of the environment there all along. Thus, instead of emphasizing the plasticity of the eye-brain-body system, Gibson emphasized what had to be true about the world for the perceptual system to arrive at an equilibrium. I urge the reader to appreciate the importance to Gibson of those chapters about experiments.Gibson 在前 13 章介绍了他的理论的主要特征和支持证据后，在第 14 章「信息获取理论及其后果」中列出了他立场的要点。他指出，「信息获取理论与传统的感知理论有根本的不同」，并接着列出了该理论的几个独特特征。这些特征包括：「一种新的感知概念，不仅仅是一个关于过程的新理论；」「关于可感知对象的新假设；」「对感知信息的新概念，总是有两种信息可用，一种关于环境，另一种关于自我；」「感知系统的新假设；」以及「光学信息获取需要系统进行一种以前任何视觉科学家都未曾想象过的活动，同时记录结构化刺激流中的持久性和变化。」关于光学信息获取，他指出，「这是理论的关键。」Gibson 理论的每一个独特特质在书中都有详细讨论。我将在这里强调第一个要点，并将其他要点留给读者自行探索。我之所以强调第一个要点，是因为根据我的经验，它没有像其他一些要点那样广泛被认可。「新知觉概念的简洁表达」可以在第 14 章的下一个小节「知觉的重新定义」中找到，稍后在同一章的「非知觉意识的新方法」一节中，他再次描述了他所指的知觉，以展示它如何迫使我们重新思考诸如记忆、思考和想象等其他所谓的过程。在「知觉的重新定义」中，他写道：「知觉是个体的成就，而不是意识剧场中的一种体验。它是一种与世界保持联系的方式，是对事物的体验而不是拥有体验。」此外，获取信息的行为是一个连续不断的活动。「连续的知觉行为涉及自我的共同知觉。」然后，在本章的后面，他写道：「知觉是对环境表面和自身表面的意识。隐藏和显露表面之间的交替对于这种意识是至关重要的。这些表面是存在的；它们在某些观察点被具体化。随着观察者探索环境，知觉变得更广泛、更细致、更长久、更丰富和更完整。对表面的全面意识包括它们的布局、它们的物质、它们的事件和它们的可供性。注意，这一定义在知觉中包含了部分记忆、期望、知识和意义 —— 在每种情况下都有一部分，但不包括所有这些心理过程。」与直接感知环境相比，感知某种介于动物与环境之间的中介是有所不同的。正如 Gibson 在第 9 章开头提到的那样，「直接感知是指从看到尼亚加拉瀑布中获得的感知，而不是从看到它的图片中获得的感知。」有时有人认为，在 Gibson 所说的直接感知意义上，感知是准确的。虽然这种说法在某种程度上是对的，但也可能会产生误导。环境是无限丰富的，没有动物能够感知到环境中的大部分。因此，Gibson 说，「随着观察者探索环境，感知变得更广泛、更精细、更深入、更丰富和更完整。」所谓「接触」或「意识到」，是指能够根据感知来指导自己的活动，制定目标并实现它们。在第十四章的「想象与感知之间的关系」部分，Gibson 列出了几种用于测试现实感知的方法。这些方法对于理解他对光学结构真实性的观点非常重要。Gibson 通过展示图像的光学结构与现实世界中实在且持久的表面光学结构之间的差异来进行说明。首先，考虑哺乳动物眼睛的镜头调节。镜头调节能让真实表面的纹理变得清晰，但对图像无效。其次，凝视某个表面会使其变得更清晰。第三，表面可以被扫描（图像则不能）。第四，可以仔细检查一个物体。实际上，Gibson 说：「对现实最具决定性的测试是你是否能够通过仔细检查发现新的特征和细节。你能否从中获得新的刺激并提取新的信息？信息是否取之不尽？是否有更多可以观察到的东西？对虚构实体的虚拟检查无法通过这个测试。」他补充道：「另一个判断事物存在的标准是可逆遮挡。任何随着你头部移动而消失并在你移回时重新出现的东西，都是一个持久存在的表面。」因此，对于由实在表面构成的环境的感知，可以是直接的，因为这种变化及其相关的不变性与任何不真实的东西是截然不同的。我对这本书的最后一个评论是它与研究发现的密切联系。第 9、10 和 11 章专门回顾了相关的研究成果。由于 Gibson 提出了一个广泛而全面的理论，一些评论者有时忽视了他对研究结果的重视。Gibson 经常表示，他的想法是基于他试图理解的研究发现而提出或修改的。一个很好的例子是棱镜研究。Gibson 总是面临解释 Stratton 和 Ivo Kohler 等人的研究结果的挑战，这些研究者的被试在数小时、数天甚至数周的时间内适应了非同寻常的光学变换。Stratton 的装置让人们看到一个颠倒的世界。许多心理学家从这些研究中看到了大脑的可塑性，而 Gibson 则在思考棱镜佩戴者究竟在适应什么。他在某种抽象层次上意识到，环境的稳定性信息一直存在。因此，Gibson 强调的不是眼-脑-身体系统的可塑性，而是世界的某些真实性质，使得知觉系统能够达到平衡。我建议读者重视那些关于实验的章节，因为它们对 Gibson 来说非常重要。
