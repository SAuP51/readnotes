Where previous technological revolutions often targeted more mechanical and repetitive work, AI works, in many ways, as a co-intelligence. It augments, or potentially replaces, human thinking to dramatic results. Early studies of the effects of AI have found it can often lead to a 20 to 80 percent improvement in productivity across a wide variety of job types, from coding to marketing. By contrast, when steam power, that most fundamental of General Purpose Technologies, the one that created the Industrial Revolution, was put into a factory, it improved productivity by 18 to 22 percent. And despite decades of looking, economists have had difficulty showing a real long-term productivity impact of computers and the internet over the past twenty years.最后，尽管以前的通用技术（General Purpose Technologies）非常伟大，但它们对工作和教育的影响实际上可能比 AI 更小。以前的技术革命通常针对的是更机械和重复性的工作，而 AI 在许多方面作为一种协同智能（co-intelligence）发挥作用。它增强了或可能取代了人类思维，带来了显著的效果。早期对 AI 影响的研究发现，它通常可以在从编码到营销的各种工作类型中提高 20% 到 80% 的生产力。相比之下，当蒸汽动力 —— 最基础的通用技术，创造了工业革命 —— 被引入工厂时，它将生产力提高了 18% 到 22%。尽管几十年来经济学家一直在研究，但他们很难证明计算机和互联网在过去二十年中对长期生产力有实际影响。
