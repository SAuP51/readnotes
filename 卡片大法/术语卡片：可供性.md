Gibson.(1979.2014).2024079The-Ecological-Approach-to-Visual-Perception.Psychology Press => 0801 The Theory of Affordances原文：I have described the environment as the surfaces that separate substances from the medium in which the animals live. But I have also described what the environment affords animals, mentioning the terrain, shelters, water, fire, objects, tools, other animals, and human displays. How do we go from surfaces to affordances? And if there is information in light for the perception of surfaces, is there information for the perception of what they afford? Perhaps the composition and layout of surfaces constitute what they afford. If so, to perceive them is to perceive what they afford. This is a radical hypothesis, for it implies that the "values" and "meanings" of things in the environment can be directly perceived. Moreover, it would explain the sense in which values and meanings are external to the perceiver.The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. The verb to afford is found in the dictionary, but the noun affordance is not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment. The antecedents of the term and the history of the concept will be treated later; for the present, let us consider examples of an affordance.If a terrestrial surface is nearly horizontal (instead of slanted), nearly flat (instead of convex or concave), and sufficiently extended (relative to the size of the animal) and if its substance is rigid (relative to the weight of the animal), then the surface affords support. It is a surface of support, and we call it a substratum, ground, or floor. It is stand-on-able, permitting an upright posture for quadrupeds and bipeds. It is therefore walk-on-able and run-over-able. It is not sink-into-able like a surface of water or a swamp, that is, not for heavy terrestrial animals. Support for water bugs is different.Note that the four properties listed-horizontal, flat, extended, and rigid- would be physical properties of a surface if they were measured with the scales and standard units used in physics. As an affordance of support for a species of animal, however, they have to be measured relative to the animal. They are unique for that animal. They are not just abstract physical properties. They have unity relative to the posture and behavior of the animal being considered. So an affordance cannot be measured as we measure in physics.Terrestrial surfaces, of course, are also climb-on-able or fall-off-able or get-underneath-able or bump-into-able relative to the animal. Different layouts afford different behaviors for different animals, and different mechanical encounters. The human species in some cultures has the habit of sitting as distinguished from kneeling or squatting. If a surface of support with the four properties is also knee-high above the ground, it affords sitting on. We call it a seat in general, or a stool, bench, chair, and so on, in particular. It may be natural like a ledge or artificial like a couch. It may have various shapes, as long as its functional layout is that of a seat. The color and texture of the surface are irrelevant. Knee-high for a child is not the same as knee-high for an adult, so the affordance is relative to the size of the individual. But if a surface is horizontal, flat, extended, rigid, and knee-high relative to a perceiver, it can in fact be sat upon. If it can be discriminated as having just these properties, it should look sit-on-able. If it does, the affordance is perceived visually. If the surface properties are seen relative to the body surfaces, the self, they constitute a seat and have meaning.There could be other examples. The different substances of the environment have different affordances for nutrition and for manufacture. The different objects of the environment have different affordances for manipulation. The other animals afford, above all, a rich and complex set of interactions, sexual, predatory, nurturing, fighting, playing, cooperating, and communicating. What other persons afford, comprises the whole realm of social significance for human beings. We pay the closest attention to the optical and acoustic information that specifies what the other person is, invites, threatens, and does.我之前提到过，环境是物质与动物生活的介质之间的分界面。同时，我还描述了环境为动物提供的各种条件，比如地形、庇护所、水源、火源、物体、工具、其他动物和人类展示等。那么，我们是如何从这些分界面理解到环境的可供性的呢？如果光线中的信息能让我们感知到这些表面，那么是否也能让我们感知到它们的用途呢？或许表面的组成和布局就代表了它们的可供性。如果真是这样，感知这些表面就意味着感知它们的可供性。这一假设很大胆，因为它暗示环境中事物的「价值」和「意义」可以被直接感知。此外，这还解释了这些价值和意义为何是外在于感知者的。环境的可供性指的是它为动物提供的条件，无论是好是坏。虽然「提供」这个动词在字典中可以找到，但「可供性」这个名词是我创造的。我用这个词来描述一种既包含环境又包含动物的关系，现有的术语无法准确表达。这意味着动物与环境之间是互补的。关于这个术语的来源和概念历史，我们稍后再讨论；现在，让我们先看一个可供性的例子。如果地表是几乎水平的（而不是倾斜的）、几乎平坦的（而不是凸起或凹陷的），并且相对于动物的体型来说足够宽广，并且其材质对动物的重量来说是刚性的，那么这个地表就能提供支撑。它就是一个支撑面，我们称之为地基、地面或地板。它能够让四足动物和两足动物保持直立姿势，也就是说，它可以行走和奔跑。它不像水面或沼泽那样会下沉，至少对于重的陆地动物来说是这样的。而水生昆虫的支撑情况则不同。需要注意的是，这四个特性 —— 水平、平坦、宽广和刚性 —— 如果用物理学中的标准单位来测量，它们是表面的物理属性。然而，作为支撑某种动物的能力，它们必须相对于动物来测量。对于该动物来说，这些特性是独特的，不仅仅是抽象的物理属性。它们相对于该动物的姿势和行为具有整体性。因此，支撑能力不能像我们在物理学中那样测量。陆地表面对于动物来说，可以攀爬、跌落、钻到下面或撞到。不同的地形布局会导致不同动物的行为和机械接触。人类在某些文化中习惯坐着，而不是跪着或蹲着。如果一个支撑面既水平又平坦、延展、坚硬，并且高度适合膝盖，那它就适合坐。我们称这种支撑面为座位，具体可以是凳子、长椅、椅子等。它可能是天然的，如岩架，也可能是人造的，如沙发。只要它的功能布局是座位，形状和表面颜色、质地都无关紧要。对孩子来说的膝盖高度和对成年人来说的膝盖高度不同，因此座位的适用性也因个体大小而异。如果一个表面具有这些特性，并且看起来适合坐，那么它就可以通过视觉感知成为座位，并具有意义。还有其他例子。环境中的不同物质对营养和制造有不同的用途。环境中的不同物体对操作有不同的功能。其他动物提供了丰富而复杂的互动，包括性行为、捕食、养育、战斗、玩耍、合作和交流。其他人提供的互动构成了人类社会的全部意义。我们最关注的是光学和声学信息，这些信息告诉我们其他人是谁、在做什么、邀请什么或威胁什么。An important fact about the affordances of the environment is that they are in a sense objective, real, and physical, unlike values and meanings, which are often supposed to be subjective, phenomenal, and mental. But, actually, an affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior. It is both physical and psychical, yet neither. An affordance points both ways, to the environment and to the observer.一个关于环境可供性（affordance）的重要事实是，它们在某种意义上是客观、真实和物理的，而不像价值和意义那样被认为是主观的、现象的和精神的。实际上，可供性既不是单纯的客观属性，也不是单纯的主观属性；或者可以说，它是两者兼具的。可供性打破了主观和客观的对立，帮助我们理解这种对立的不足。它既是环境的事实，也是行为的事实。既有物理属性，也有心理属性，但又不完全是其中任何一种。可供性同时指向环境和观察者。The concept of affordance is derived from these concepts of valence, invita- tion, and demand but with a crucial difference. The affordance of something does not change as the need of the observer changes. The observer may or may not perceive or attend to the affordance, according to his needs, but the afford- ance, being invariant, is always there to be perceived. An affordance is not bestowed upon an object by a need of an observer and his act of perceiving it. The object offers what it does because it is what it is. To be sure, we define what it is in terms of ecological physics instead of physical physics, and it therefore possesses meaning and value to begin with. But this is meaning and value of a new sort.For Koffka it was the phenomenal postbox that invited letter-mailing, not the physical postbox. But this duality is pernicious. I prefer to say that the real postbox (the only one)affords letter-mailing to a letter-writing human in a community with a postal system. This fact is perceived when the postbox is identified as such, and it is apprehended whether the postbox is in sight or out of sight. To feel a special attraction to it when one has a letter to mail is not surprising, but the main fact is that it is perceived as part of the environment as an item of the neighborhood in which we live. Everyone above the age of six knows what it is for and where the nearest one is. The perception of its afford- ance should therefore not be confused with the temporary special attraction it may have.可供性（Affordance）这个概念源于效价、邀请和需求，但有一个关键区别。某物的可供性不会随着观察者需求的变化而改变。观察者可以根据自己的需求去感知或关注可供性，但可供性本身是恒定的，总是存在的。可供性不是由观察者的需求和感知行为赋予物体的。物体提供什么，是因为它本身的特性决定的。当然，我们用生态物理学（Ecological Physics）来定义它，而不是传统的物理学，因此它从一开始就具有新的意义和价值。对于 Koffka 来说，是现象中的邮筒邀请了寄信，而不是实际的邮筒。但这种区分是有害的。我更倾向于说，真实的邮筒（唯一的邮筒）在有邮政系统的社区中，为写信的人提供了寄信的机会。当邮筒被识别出来时，这一事实就被感知到了，无论邮筒是否在视线范围内。当有信需要寄时，对邮筒感到特别吸引力并不奇怪，但更重要的是，它被感知为我们生活社区的一部分。每个六岁以上的人都知道它的用途和最近的邮筒在哪里。因此，对邮筒可供性的感知不应与它可能具有的暂时特殊吸引力混淆。
