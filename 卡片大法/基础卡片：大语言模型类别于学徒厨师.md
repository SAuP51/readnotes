To learn the culinary arts, the apprentice starts by reading and studying a vast collection of recipes from around the world. Each recipe represents a piece of text, with various ingredients symbolizing words and phrases. The apprentice's goal is to understand how to combine different ingredients (words) to create a delicious dish (coherent text).The apprentice chef begins with a chaotic, disorganized pantry, representing the 175 billion weights. Initially, these weights have random values and do not yet contain any useful information about how words are related. To build their knowledge and refine the spice rack, the apprentice chef goes through a process of trial and error, learning from the recipes they have studied. It finds that certain flavors are more common and go better together—like apples and cinnamon—and certain flavors are rare because they should be avoided—like apples and cumin. During training, the apprentice chef attempts to re-create the dishes from the recipes using their current pantry. After each attempt, the apprentice compares their creation to the original recipe and identifies any mistakes or discrepancies. The apprentice then reconsiders the ingredients in the pantry, refining the connections between flavors to better understand how likely they are to be used together or in a particular sequence.Over time, and through countless iterations, the apprentice chef's pantry becomes more organized and accurate. The weights now reflect meaningful connections between words and phrases, and the apprentice has transformed into a master chef. When given a prompt, the master chef artfully selects the right ingredients from their vast repertoire and consults their refined spice rack to ensure the perfect balance of flavors. In an analogous way, AI creates humanlike written text that is engaging, informative, and relevant to the topic at hand.LLM 可以想象成一个勤奋的学徒厨师，渴望成为一名大厨。为了学习烹饪艺术，学徒首先通过阅读和研究来自世界各地的大量食谱。每个食谱代表一段文本，各种成分象征着单词和短语。学徒的目标是了解如何组合不同的成分（单词）以创造出美味的菜肴（连贯的文本）。学徒厨师一开始面对的是一个混乱无序的食品储藏室，这象征着 1750 亿个权重。这些权重起初是随机的，还没有包含任何关于词语关系的有用信息。为了积累知识并优化香料架，学徒厨师通过反复试验，从所学的食谱中吸取经验。他发现某些风味更为常见且搭配得更好，比如苹果和肉桂，而某些风味则罕见且需要避免，比如苹果和孜然。在训练过程中，学徒厨师尝试用现有的食材重新制作菜肴。每次尝试后，他都会将自己的作品与原始食谱进行比较，找出错误或不同之处。然后，他会重新考虑储藏室中的食材，优化风味之间的连接，更好地理解它们一起使用或按特定顺序使用的可能性。随着时间的推移，通过无数次的迭代，学徒厨师的食品储藏室变得更加有序和精确。这些权重现在反映了词语和短语之间有意义的联系，学徒厨师也变成了一位大师厨师。当收到一个提示时，大师厨师能巧妙地从广泛的食材库中挑选合适的成分，并利用优化后的香料架，确保完美的风味平衡。类似地，AI 能够生成引人入胜、信息丰富且与话题相关的文本。
