基础卡片：从经济学角度看待《星际迷航》2024-05-16解释：参考：Salman Khan.(2024).2024038Brave-New-Words.Penguin Publishing Group => 0901 Work and What Comes Next原文：Few people may view the Star Trek universe through an economic lens, but doing so provides a window into a world that might soon be upon us. All of classical economics is based on the notion of scarcity—namely, that there isn't usually enough of anything to give everyone everything they want or need. Because of that, we use markets and pricing to allocate those goods, services, and resources to where they might result in the highest benefit. In Star Trek , however, there isn't much scarcity. Technology has allowed that society to replicate any food they want, transport themselves thousands of miles in the blink of an eye, communicate over light-years, and travel among the stars. All of humanity in that world has been fully educated so that they can participate in this bounty. Everyone is an explorer, researcher, engineer, artist, doctor, or counselor. Generative AI has the potential to allow many dimensions of our own society to be similarly low scarcity or highly abundant. Do we have the will to take us to the utopia of Star Trek?很少有人会从经济学角度看待《星际迷航》宇宙，但这样做可以让我们一窥一个即将到来的世界。所有经典经济学都基于资源稀缺的概念，即通常没有足够的东西来满足每个人的所有需求或愿望。因此，我们使用市场和定价来分配这些商品、服务和资源，以便它们能产生最大的效益。然而，在《星际迷航》中，资源稀缺并不多见。技术使得那个社会可以复制任何他们想要的食物，在瞬间运输自己数千英里，跨越光年进行通信，并在星际间旅行。那个世界中的所有人类都接受了充分的教育，使他们能够参与这份丰盛。每个人都是探险家、研究员、工程师、艺术家、医生或顾问。生成式 AI（Generative AI）有潜力使我们社会的许多方面也变得资源丰富。我们是否有决心实现《星际迷航》中的乌托邦？
