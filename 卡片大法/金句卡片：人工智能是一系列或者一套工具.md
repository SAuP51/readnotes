原文：



Let's start by looking at where generative Al fits within the Al landscape.



我们先来看看生成式人工智能在人工智能领域中的定位。



There's a lot of buzz and excitement and also hype about Al, and I think a useful way to think of Al is as a collection or as a set of tools.



关于人工智能有很多热议和兴奋，也有夸大其词的地方，我认为一个有用的思考方式是将人工智能看作是一系列或一套工具。



One of the most important tools in Al is supervised learning, which turns out to be really good at labeling things.



人工智能中最重要的工具之一是监督学习，它在标记事物方面非常出色。



Don't worry if you don't know what this means, we'll talk more about it on the next slide.



如果你不知道这意味着什么，不用担心，我们将在下一张幻灯片上更多地讨论它。



Second to it that started to work really well only fairly recently is generative Al.



紧随其后的是生成式人工智能，它在最近才开始表现得非常好。



If you study Al, you may recognize that there are other tools as well, such as things called unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.



如果你研究人工智能，你可能会认识到还有其他工具，如所谓的无监督学习和强化学习。



But for the purposes of this course, I'm going to touch briefly on what is supervised learning and then spend most of our time talking about generative Al.



但为了本课程的目的，我将简要介绍什么是监督学习，然后我们将花大部分时间讨论生成式人工智能。



These two, supervised learning and generative Al, are the two most important tools in Al today.



这两个，监督学习和生成式人工智能，是当今人工智能中最重要的两个工具。
