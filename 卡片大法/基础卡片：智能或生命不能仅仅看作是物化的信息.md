基础卡片：智能或生命不能仅仅看作是物化的信息2024-05-19解释：参考：selfstudy => 003Paper => 2024009What-Is-Information原文：Information in the form of words or language is symbolic. The word cat is a symbol that represents a class of living breathing creatures made of flesh. An actual cat is not a symbol of something else but an organization of organic chemicals that can propagate its organization through its metabolism and its ability to replicate.The organic chemicals of which we are composed are continually replaced so that after seven years there is a completely new set of molecules. So we are not flesh or a particular set of molecules but the organization of the molecules of which we are composed or more accurately we are a process and not a thing that can be duplicated.One cannot make a replica of a person. Even twins that originated from the same fertilized egg are never exactly the same. But a text can be replicated or duplicated exactly. A text can also be transmitted and reformatted from one medium to another, for example from a computer file to a text printed on paper or from a live performance to a podcast.I believe that the proponents of strong artificial intelligence (AI) and strong artificial life (AL) make the mistake of considering intelligence or life as merely reified information. They do not take into account that it is the interaction or organization of flesh-based matter that makes intelligence and life. The pattern of that interaction or organization that we identify as information cannot be abstracted away from the physical medium in which it is instantiated and remain unchanged or, even more importantly, continue as the process that gave rise to that intelligence or life in the first place.A feature of both intelligence and life is that it is autonomous. A living organism is an autonomous agent that has the capacity to exploit free energy from its environment and use that energy in the form of work to carry out its metabolism, to replicate and to make use of its intelligence. The proponents of strong AI and AL overlook this important factor when they claim that intelligence and life is nothing more than information or a pattern that is independent of its physical instantiation. At best artificial life forms may be regarded as obligate symbionts with humans but not as independent living organisms as they are not autonomous.文字或语言形式的信息是符号化的。比如，「猫」这个词是一个符号，代表了一类由肉体组成的活生生的生物。而实际的猫并不是其他事物的符号，而是由有机化学物质组成的实体，这些物质通过代谢和复制能力传播其组织。构成我们的有机化学物质不断被替换，所以在七年后，我们体内的分子已经完全更新。因此，我们不是某一特定的一组分子，而是这些分子的组织，更准确地说，我们是一个过程，而不是可以复制的东西。人类是不可能被复制的。即使是来自同一个受精卵的双胞胎也不是完全相同的。但文本可以被精确地复制和重复。文本还可以从一种媒介传输并重新格式化到另一种媒介，例如从计算机文件到打印在纸上的文本或从现场表演到播客。我认为强人工智能（AI）和强人工生命（AL）的支持者犯了一个错误，他们把智能或生命仅仅看作物化的信息。他们没有考虑到，是基于肉体物质的互动或组织使得智能和生命成为可能。我们识别为信息的互动或组织的模式不能脱离其具体的物理媒介而保持不变，更重要的是，不能继续作为最初产生该智能或生命的过程。智能和生命的一个特征是自主性。一个有机体是一个自主的智能体（agent)，它能从环境中获取自由能，并利用这种能量进行新陈代谢、复制和运用其智能。强 AI 和 AL 的支持者忽略了这一重要因素，当他们声称智能和生命仅仅是信息或与其物理实现无关的模式时。人工生命形式最多只能被视为与人类共生的存在，而不能被视为独立的有机体，因为它们缺乏自主性。
