We shall argue that the proper and deep understanding of Schro¨dinger's intuition is that an aperiodic crystal contains a very large number of diverse constraints that are partially causal in guiding the huge diversity of specific events and processes which occur physically in cells. From this we shall arrive at a new formulation: constraints are information and information is constraints. The first part of this twosome, constraints are information is, we believe, secure. The second part, information is constraints, may be more problematic.在「薛定谔的非周期晶体」一节中，我们首先引用了薛定谔的著名言论，即周期晶体所能表达的信息有限，而非周期晶体可以包含大量信息，并且会包含一个微码。我们将论证，深刻理解薛定谔的这一直觉，即非周期晶体包含大量多样的约束，这些约束在指导细胞内各种具体事件和过程方面具有部分因果性。由此我们提出一个新观点：约束就是信息，信息就是约束。我们认为，前半部分「约束就是信息」是可靠的，而后半部分「信息就是约束」可能存在争议。"The constraints are information" is a way to describe the limits on the behavior of an autonomous agent who acts on its own behalf but is nevertheless constrained by the internal logic that allows it to propagate its organization. This is consistent with Hayle's (1999, p. 72) description of the way information is regarded by information science: "It constructs information as the site of mastery and control over the material world." She claims, and we concur, that information science treats information as separate from the material base in which it is instantiated. This suggests that there is nothing intrinsic about information but rather it is merely a description of or a metaphor for the complex patterns of behavior of material things. In fact, the key is to what degree information is a completely vivid description of the objects in question.「约束是信息」是指自主智能体的行为受到限制，这些限制源于其内部逻辑，确保其组织能够持续。这与 Hayle（1999, p. 72）对信息的描述一致：「信息被构建为对物质世界的掌控和控制的场所。」她认为，信息科学将信息视为独立于其物质基础的存在。我们同意这一观点，这意味着信息本身没有内在属性，而是对物质行为复杂模式的描述或隐喻。事实上，关键在于信息在多大程度上能够生动地描述对象。
