基础卡片：刻意练习的三个硬伤2024-02-18解释：。参考：selfstudy => 003Paper => 2021064Rethinking-Expertise原文：First, as detailed in the previous section, meta-analyses demonstrate that deliberate practice fails to account for all, nearly all, or even most of the variance in expert performance, and often even explains only a surprisingly small proportion of the total variance. A common objection to such findings is to question the study’s validity, and more specifically, to suggest that the participants did not engage in sufficiently deliberate practice that and/or the employed practice measure did not tap deliberate practice unambiguously enough (Ericsson, 2014b, 2014c; Ericsson, Roring, & Nandagopal, 2007b). This argument may appear circular—deliberate practice explains expert performance, and if the data show something else, the practice was not real deliberate practice—but of course the point would be completely valid if there were a general agreement on exactly which activities qualify as deliberate practice in various domains, as well as solid data showing that deliberate practice, with this definition, predicts expert performance, whereas other forms of practice do not. However, the distinction between deliberate practice and other forms of practice is in reality often very unclear (Howard, 2009). Furthermore, there is abundant ev-idence showing that forms of domain-relevant experience other than deliberate practice lead to improvements of performance, and that the optimal practice style can vary depending on personality (Howard, 2009, 2012; Kluge, Ritzmann, Burkolter, & Sauer, 2011). In fact, entirely implicit forms of learning from experience and exposure are important, for example, for the acquisition of linguistic expertise (Forkstam & Petersson, 2005; Perruchet & Pacton, 2006). Finally, there is evidence from chess that number of games played—a domain-related activity that cannot be regarded as solitary deliberate practice in any sense of the term—is a strong predictor of skill level (Howard, 2012).首先，正如之前部分所述，元分析显示刻意练习并不能解释专家表现中所有或大多数的差异，并且有时甚至只能解释总差异中一个意外的小部分。对这些发现的常见反应是质疑研究的有效性，具体来说，是质疑参与者是否进行了足够的、明确的刻意练习（如 Ericsson 在 2014 年的论述）。这种论点可能看起来有点自圆其说 —— 如果数据与刻意练习解释专家表现的观点不符，那么所进行的就不是真正的刻意练习。然而，如果大家对于哪些活动属于刻意练习达成共识，并且有确凿数据显示刻意练习（根据这一定义）可以预测专家表现而其他练习形式则不行，这个观点就完全站得住脚。不过，实际上刻意练习与其他练习形式之间的界限往往非常模糊（Howard, 2009）。更重要的是，大量证据表明，除刻意练习外的领域相关经验也能提升表现，而且最适合的练习方式可能会根据个人性格而有所不同（Howard, 2009, 2012; Kluge 等人，2011 年）。事实上，从经验和接触中进行的完全隐性学习对于获得语言等专业技能至关重要（Forkstam & Petersson, 2005; Perruchet & Pacton, 2006）。最后，国际象棋的研究证明，下棋次数 —— 一种与刻意练习在任何意义上都不相同的领域相关活动 —— 是预测技能水平的强有力指标（Howard, 2012）。A second common objection is that studies showing modest effects of deliberate practice have ignored effects of injury, disease, and related variables (Ericsson, 2014c). These variables should obviously be considered among the many variables, apart from deliberate practice, that potentially influence expert performance. However, it is important to note that the proportion of variance in expert performance that should be explained by deliberate practice, taking the mentioned variables into account, is not specified by deliberate practice theory. This makes the proposal impossible to evaluate empirically (i.e., to falsify). More importantly, deliberate practice theory provides no plausible explanation for recent empirical findings on this issue, including the systematic differences in deliberate-practice/expert-performance relations between tasks and domains, and their dependence on moderator variables. Deliberate practice theory does not explain why, for example, deliberate practice explains a relatively large proportion of expert performance variance in musicians and athletes—groups highly susceptible to injury and overuse—and a much smaller amount of the variance in domains in which injury and overuse are uncommon, such as professions with minimal physical demands (e.g., sales; see Sonnentag & Kleine, 2000).第二个经常被提出的批评是，一些研究因忽略了受伤、疾病及其相关变量的影响，而只报告了刻意练习的有限效果（Ericsson, 2014c）。显然，这些因素应被认为是影响专家表现的多个因素之一，除了刻意练习。然而，值得注意的是，考虑到这些因素，刻意练习在解释专家表现的变异中所占比例，并未在刻意练习理论中明确给出。这使得从经验角度对该理论进行评估（即，证伪）变得不可能。更重要的是，面对包括任务和领域间刻意练习与专家表现关系的系统差异以及这些差异对调节变量的依赖等最新的经验发现，刻意练习理论未提供一个合理的解释。例如，刻意练习理论未能解释为何在容易受伤和过度使用的群体，如音乐家和运动员中，刻意练习能解释相对较大的专家表现变异比例，而在受伤和过度使用不常见的领域，如身体要求最小的职业（比如销售），刻意练习所解释的变异量却要小得多（参见 Sonnentag & Kleine, 2000）。A third recurring controversy is whether tasks that show less impressive correlations with deliberate practice and/or substantial relations to variables other than deliberate practice qualify as true forms of expert performance. One example is musical aptitude, operationalized as the ability to discriminate musical melodies, rhythms, and pitches. This ability is related to intelligence (Lynn & Gault, 1986; Lynn, Wilson, & Gault, 1989) and music practice (Ullén, Mosing, Holm, Eriksson, & Madison, 2014). As already discussed, it has recently been found that these associations are essentially driven by common genetic influences (Mosing, Madison, et al., 2014; Mosing, Pedersen, Madison, & Ullén, 2014). In a recent commentary, Ericsson (2014c) dismisses studies of music discrimination because they “test memory and perception of music rather than music performance” (p. 85). However, the capability to discriminate musical sounds is essential for music performance. Furthermore, musical discrimination is commonly measured in entrance exams to music colleges, and correlates nontrivially with music practice, musician status, and musical achievement (Seashore, 1938; Ullén et al., 2014; Wallentin, Nielsen, Friis-Olivarius, Vuust, & Vuust, 2010). One can note that in other contexts, when expert performance does correlate with deliberate practice but not with professional status, this has been taken not as a challenge to the expert performance paradigm or as evidence that the expert performance task is unrepresentative, but rather as support for that professional status is an unreliable and potentially irrelevant outcome in expertise research (Ericsson, 2014c; Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996).第三个反复出现的争议涉及到那些与刻意练习的相关性不那么显著或与刻意练习以外的变量有显著联系的任务是否能够被视为真正的专家表现形式。音乐才能的例子，特别是区分音乐旋律、节奏和音高的能力，就是一个例子。这种能力与智力（Lynn & Gault, 1986; Lynn, Wilson, & Gault, 1989）和音乐练习（Ullén, Mosing, Holm, Eriksson, & Madison, 2014）相关。正如前文讨论的，这些关联基本上是由共同的遗传因素驱动的（Mosing, Madison, 等，2014; Mosing, Pedersen, Madison, & Ullén, 2014）。Ericsson（2014c）近期的评论中对音乐区分能力的研究提出批评，认为它们「测试的是对音乐的记忆和感知，而非音乐表演本身」（第 85 页）。然而，音乐声音的区分能力对于音乐表演至关重要。此外，音乐区分能力常在音乐学院的入学考试中被测试，并与音乐练习、音乐家地位和音乐成就有着密切的关联（Seashore, 1938; Ullén 等人，2014; Wallentin, Nielsen, Friis-Olivarius, Vuust, & Vuust, 2010）。值得注意的是，在某些情况下，即使专家表现与刻意练习有关联，但与职业地位无关，这并不被视为挑战专家表现范式或表明专家表现任务不具代表性的证据，而是被认为是支持职业地位在专业知识研究中可能是不可靠和不相关的结果（Ericsson, 2014c; Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996）。
