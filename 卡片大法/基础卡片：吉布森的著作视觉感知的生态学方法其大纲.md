Part II is about the information for perception. Part III is about the activity of perception. Finally, Part IV is about pictures and the special kinds of awareness that go with looking at them. Picture vision comes last because it can be understood only after we are clear about ambient vision and ambulatory vision.First, the environment must be described, since what there is to be perceived has to be stipulated before one can even talk about perceiving it. This is not the world of physics but the world at the level of ecology. Second, the information available for perception in an illuminated medium must be described. This is not just light for stimulating receptors but the information in the light that can activate the system. Ecological optics is required instead of classical optics. Third (and only here do we come to what is called psychology proper),the process of perception must be described. This is not the processing of sensory inputs, however, but the extracting of invariants from the stimulus flux. The old idea that sensory inputs are converted into perceptions by operations of the mind is rejected. A radically new way of thinking about perception is proposed.The ecological approach to perception was adopted in my book The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems, which came out in 1966. Actually, it is a new approach to the whole field of psychology, for it involves rejecting the stimu- lus-response formula. This notion, borrowed from the so-called hard science of physiology, helped to get rid of the doctrine of the soul in psychology, but it never really worked. Neither mentalism on the one hand nor conditioned- response behaviorism on the other is good enough. What psychology needs is the kind of thinking that is beginning to be attempted in what is loosely called systems theory.本书的第一部分讨论的是感知的环境。第二部分探讨感知的信息。第三部分介绍感知的活动。最后，第四部分则是关于图片以及与观察图片相关的特殊感知类型。最后讨论图片视觉是因为只有在理解了环境视觉和行走视觉之后，才能更好地理解它。首先，需要描述环境，因为在讨论感知之前，必须明确要感知的对象。这不是物理学的世界，而是生态学层面的世界。其次，需要描述在光照媒介中可用于感知的信息。这不仅仅是光刺激受体，而是光中能够激活系统的信息。因此需要的是生态光学，而不是经典光学。第三（这里才真正进入心理学的范畴），需要描述感知过程。这并不是处理感官输入，而是从刺激流中提取不变性。旧的观点认为感官输入通过心理操作转化为感知，这种观点被否定了。提出了一种全新的感知思维方式。我在 1966 年出版的《作为感知系统的感觉》一书中采用了生态学的感知方法。实际上，这是一种全新的心理学方法，因为它拒绝了传统的刺激-反应公式。这一公式源于所谓的生理学硬科学，虽然帮助我们摆脱了心理学中的灵魂学说，但并未真正奏效。无论是精神主义还是条件反应行为主义都不够完善。心理学需要的是一种类似于系统理论的新思维方式。
