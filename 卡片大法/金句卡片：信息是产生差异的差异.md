No doubt the reader is familiar with Gregory Bateson [4] famous definition of information as "the difference that makes a difference." Buried in this one-liner is the notion that it is the meaning of the information that makes the difference. Although Bateson gets credit for this idea it is likely that he was influenced by MacKay [3] who in his book Information, Mechanism and Meaning published four years before the appearance of Bateson's one-liner wrote: "information is a distinction that makes a difference." Bateson, MacKay and Shannon were all participants in the Macy conferences so Bateson was quite familiar with MacKay's ideas. The use of the term "distinction" in MacKay's one-liner is more closely tied to the idea of "meaning" than the term "difference". It is ironic that MacKay who pointed out the shortcomings of Shannon information, was the first to use the term "information theory" and was the first to point out that the importance of information is its meaning and the fact that it makes a difference. MacKay is certainly a scholar who made a difference and he deserves more credit and attribution than he usually receives. And both MacKay and Bateson deserve credit for reminding us that meaning is a critical part of information and that Shannon's notion of information is not the whole story.Another one line definition of information that incorporates the notion of its meaning is this one by Ed Fredkin which I would put in a league with Mackay and Bateson's one-liners. "The meaning of information is given by the processes that interpret it." This is a very insightful definition because it explicitly incorporates the notion that information depends on context.If information is the distinction (McKay) or the difference (Bateson) that makes a difference then if there is no distinction or no difference then there can be no information. This would mean chaos or random numbers contain no information because there is no difference or distinction in one part of the stream of numbers as opposed to another part of the stream because of a lack of organization. This is opposite to the conclusion of Shannon who claims that a stream of random numbers contains the maximum information. While it is true each element is different from the next and is a complete surprise it is also true that the overall pattern of chaos and randomness is the same and hence there is no distinction nor is there any difference in the stream of random numbers. A gas, which remains uniformly at the same temperature, pressure and volume, is constantly changing but one cannot make a distinction between the gas at one moment and the gas at another moment. There is no difference in the way the gas behaves at these different moments. The only information one can discern about the gas is its volume, pressure and temperature, which is unchanging. No work can be done by this gas. If however in this volume of gas there is a temperature differential then work can be extracted from the gas and there is information in the gas by virtue of the way in which the temperature differential is organized. This raises the question of whether or not organization is information, a point we will return to later in this paper once we have dealt with the nature of information in biotic systems.尽管 Shannon 将信息与意义分离的观点成为了信息理论的核心，但 MacKay 的反对意见也产生了一定的影响，导致人们对信息的看法有所改变。相信读者们对 Gregory Bateson [4] 著名的信息定义「引起差异的差异」已经耳熟能详。这句话其实暗示了信息的意义才是引起差异的关键。虽然 Bateson 因此得到了认可，但他很可能受到了 MacKay [3] 的影响。MacKay 在其书《信息、机制和意义》中写道：「信息是引起差异的区分。」这本书出版时间比 Bateson 的定义早了四年。Bateson、MacKay 和 Shannon 都参加了 Macy 会议，因此 Bateson 对 MacKay 的思想非常熟悉。相比之下，MacKay 使用的「区分」一词比「差异」更能体现与「意义」的联系。讽刺的是，MacKay 是指出 Shannon 信息理论缺陷的第一个人，也是最早使用「信息理论」一词的人，并强调信息的重要性在于其意义和影响。MacKay 确实是一位对信息理论有重要贡献的学者，他应当得到更多的认可和赞誉。Bateson 和 MacKay 都提醒我们，信息的意义至关重要，Shannon 的信息概念并不完整。Ed Fredkin 也给出了另一种包含信息意义的定义，他说：「信息的意义由解释它的过程决定。」这个定义非常有见地，因为它明确指出了信息依赖于上下文这一概念。如果信息是 McKay 所说的区分，或者 Bateson 所说的差异，那么没有区分或差异就不会有信息。这意味着混乱或随机数字不包含信息，因为数字流的某一部分与另一部分之间没有组织上的差异。这与 Shannon 的结论相反，他认为随机数字流包含最大的量的信息。虽然每个元素都是不同的并且是一个完全的惊喜，但整体的混乱和随机模式是相同的，因此在随机数字流中没有区分或差异。对于一个在相同温度、压力和体积下保持均匀的气体来说，尽管气体在不断变化，但人们无法区分某一时刻的气体与另一时刻的气体。在这些不同的时刻，气体的行为没有差异。人们只能辨别气体的体积、压力和温度，这些是不会变化的。这个气体无法做功。然而，如果这个气体体积中存在温度差异，那么可以从气体中提取功，并且气体中存在信息，因为温度差异的组织方式。这引出了一个问题：组织是否就是信息，我们将在本文后面对生物系统中的信息性质进行讨论时回到这个问题。
