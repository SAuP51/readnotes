The pressure for organizations to take a stand on a technology that affects their most highly paid workers will be immense, as will the value of these workers becoming more productive. Without a fundamental restructuring of how organizations work, the benefits of AI will never be recognized.最终，公司需要开始考虑有效使用 AI 的另一个重要组成部分：系统。组织在采用能影响其高薪员工的技术时，会面临巨大的压力，因为这些员工的生产力提升将带来巨大的价值。如果不对组织的运行方式进行根本性的重组，AI 的好处将无法完全实现。We often take for granted the systems we use to structure and coordinate work in our organizations. We assume they are natural ways of getting things done. But in reality, they are historical artifacts, shaped by the technological and social conditions of their times. The organizational chart, for example, was originally made to run railroads in the 1850s. Developed by early railroad barons, they created a hierarchical system of authority, responsibility, and communication that enabled them to control and monitor the operations of their railroad empire. Enabled by the telegraph, they integrated humans into a clear hierarchy, with bosses giving orders that flowed through the rails and telegraph lines to the workers at the bottom of the chart. The system was so successful that it was soon adopted by other industries and organizations, becoming the standard model of bureaucracy for the twentieth century.Another system emerged from a different combination of human limitations and technology: the assembly line. Generally credited to Henry Ford in the early twentieth century, it allowed his company to mass-produce automobiles at a lower cost and higher speed. He realized that humans were not very good at performing complex and varied tasks, but they were very good at performing simple and repetitive work. He also noticed that technology could help him synchronize and optimize the flow of work, by using standardized tools and parts, and new technologies like conveyor belts and timers. He divided the production process into small and simple tasks, and assigned them to workers who performed them repeatedly and efficiently. His system was so successful that it revolutionized the manufacturing industry, creating economies of scale and scope and enabling mass consumption and customization.The internet marked another new set of technologies to organize and control work, which is why we have seen the emergence of new systems of work organization and management in recent decades, such as agile software development, lean manufacturing, holacracy, and self-managing teams. Enabled by waves of tools ranging from email to complex enterprise software, these management trends took new, data-driven approaches to organizing. But, like all work before, they still rely on human capabilities and limitations. Human attention remains finite, our emotions are still important, and workers still need bathroom breaks. The technology changes, but workers and managers are just people.This is what AI may alter. By acting as a co-intelligence managing work, or at least helping managers manage work, the enhanced capabilities of LLMs could radically change the experience of work. A single AI can talk to hundreds of workers, offering advice and monitoring performance. They could mentor, or they could manipulate. They could guide decisions in ways that are subtle or overt.我们常常认为，在组织中用来构建和协调工作的系统是理所当然的，自然而然的完成事情的方式。但实际上，这些系统是历史的产物，受到当时技术和社会条件的影响。例如，组织结构图最初是在 1850 年代为了管理铁路而创建的。早期的铁路大亨们开发了一个权威、责任和沟通的层级系统，使他们能够控制和监控铁路帝国的运营。在电报技术的支持下，他们将人们整合到一个清晰的层级结构中，老板通过铁轨和电报线将命令传达给最底层的工人。这个系统非常成功，很快被其他行业和组织采用，成为二十世纪的标准官僚模式。另一个基于人类局限性与技术组合的系统是装配线。通常认为是 Henry Ford 在二十世纪初发明的，这使他的公司能够以更低的成本和更高的速度大规模生产汽车。他认识到人类不擅长执行复杂且多样化的任务，但在执行简单且重复的工作时非常出色。他还发现，通过使用标准化的工具和零件，以及新的技术如传送带和计时器，可以同步和优化工作流程。因此，他将生产过程分解为小而简单的任务，并让工人反复高效地执行。这一系统非常成功，彻底改变了制造业，带来了规模经济和范围经济，并推动了大规模消费和定制。互联网的出现标志着组织和控制工作的新技术，近年来也因此涌现了新的工作组织和管理系统，例如敏捷软件开发、精益制造、全体自治和自我管理团队。在从电子邮件到复杂的企业软件等工具的推动下，这些管理趋势采用了新的数据驱动方法来组织工作。然而，和以往的工作一样，它们仍然依赖于人类的能力和局限。人类的注意力有限，情感依然重要，工人们仍然需要休息。尽管技术在变化，工人和管理者还是人类。这是 AI 可能改变的地方。通过作为共同智能体来管理工作，或至少帮助管理者管理工作，LLM 的增强能力可能会彻底改变工作的体验。单个 AI 可以与数百名工人交流，提供建议并监控绩效。它们可以指导，也可以操控，能够以微妙或明显的方式引导决策。
