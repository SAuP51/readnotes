At its core, Shannon envisioned a Source with a set of messages, symbol strings, over which a well defined probability distribution might be attributed. Then he envisioned a (perhaps noisy) channel over which information is transmitted. He then envisioned a receiver and, importantly, a decoder. Shannon's move was to calculate the entropy of the set of messages at the Source. The information that propagated down the channel and was received at the receiver removed uncertainty with respect to the entropy of the Source. This reduction of uncertainty, hence the lowering of the entropy of the Source, constitutes the amount of information transmitted. One interpretation, not given by Shannon himself who abjured to say what information "is," is that information is just the reduction in uncertainty at the receiver. This definition leaves open exactly what the claim might mean. It might be the reduction of uncertainty in a human receiver's mind, for example.Importantly, and widely recognized, is the fact that Shannon information considers the amount of information, nominally in bits, but is devoid of semantics. There is no sense of what information is "about" in Shannon information.Shannon（1948）的信息理论是一项辉煌的数学构想。Shannon 设想了一个消息源，这个源包含一组符号串构成的消息，并且这些消息可以归属一个明确的概率分布。他还设想了一个（可能有噪声的）信道，通过这个信道传输信息。接着，他设想了一个接收器以及一个重要的解码器。Shannon 的方法是计算消息源中消息的熵。通过信道传输并在接收器处接收到的信息减少了关于源的熵的不确定性。这种不确定性的减少，也就是源的熵的降低，构成了传输的信息量。虽然 Shannon 自己没有明确说明信息「是什么」，一种解释是信息只是接收器处不确定性的减少。这个定义并没有明确指出具体含义。例如，它可能指的是在人类接收者心中的不确定性减少。重要且广泛认可的是，香农信息关注的是信息量，通常以比特为单位，但并不涉及信息的语义。香农信息没有讨论信息「关于什么」的含义。
