The core argument of POE was that Shannon information "does not apply to the evolution of the biosphere" because Darwinian preadaptations cannot be predicted and as a consequence "the ensemble of possibilities and their entropy cannot be calculated [1]." Therefore a definition of information as reducing uncertainty does not make sense since no matter how much one learns from the information in a biotic system the uncertainty remains infinite because the number of possibilities of what can evolve is infinitely non-denumerable. I remind the reader that in making his definition that Shannon specified that the number of possible messages was finite.Instead of Shannon information we defined a new form of information, which we called instructional or biotic information, not with Shannon, but with constraints or boundary conditions. The amount of information will be related to the diversity of constraints and the diversity of processes that they can partially cause to occur. By taking this step, we embed the concept of information in the ongoing processes of the biosphere, for they are causally relevant to that which happens in the unfolding of the biosphere.We therefore conclude that constraints are information and… information is constraints… We use the term "instructional information" because of the instructional function this information performs and we sometimes call it "biotic information" because this is the domain it acts in, as opposed to human telecommunication or computer information systems where Shannon information operates [1].A living organism is an open system, which von Bertalanffy [16] "defined as a system in exchange of matter with its environment, presenting import and export, building-up and breaking-down of its material components." Instructional or biotic information may therefore be defined as the organization of that exchange of energy and matter. The fact that a biotic system is an open system can be used to argue against the association of instructional or biotic information with cybernetics because cybernetics focuses strictly on the flow of information and does not deal with the flow of energy and matter.In POE [1] we argued that constraints acting as instructional information are essential to the operation of a cell and the propagation of its organization.The working of a cell is, in part, a complex web of constraints, or boundary conditions, which partially direct or cause the events which happen. Importantly, the propagating organization in the cell is the structural union of constraints as instructional information, the constrained release of energy as work, the use of work in the construction of copies of information, the use of work in the construction of other structures, and the construction of further constraints as instructional information. This instructional information further constrains the further release of energy in diverse specific ways, all of which propagates organization of process that completes a closure of tasks whereby the cell reproduces [1].In POE [1] we associated biotic or instructional information with the organization that a biotic agent is able to propagate. This contradicts Shannon's definition of information and the notion that a random set or soup of organic chemicals has more Shannon information than a structured and organized set of organic chemicals found in a living organism.The biotic agent has more meaning than the soup, however. The living organism with more structure and more organization has less Shannon information. This is counterintuitive to a biologist's understanding of a living organism. We therefore conclude that the use of Shannon information to describe a biotic system would not be valid. Shannon information for a biotic system is simply a category error. A living organism has meaning because it is an autonomous agent acting on its own behalf. A random soup of organic chemicals has no meaning and no organization [1].The key point that was uncovered in the POE analysis was the fact that Shannon information could be defined independent of meaning whereas biotic or instructional was intimately connected to the meaning of the organism's information, namely the propagation of its organization. Thus we see organization within a system as a form of information, which is a much more dynamic notion of information than Shannon information which is merely a string of symbols or bits.According to Shannon's definition of information a set of random numbers transmitted over a telephone line would have more information than the set of even numbers transmitted over the same line. Once 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 was received the receiver, who is assumed to be a clever person, would be able to correctly guess that the rest of the numbers to follow the sequence would be the set of even numbers. The random numbers have no organization but the even numbers are organized so the mystery of the relevance of Shannon information deepens as one must counter-intuitively conclude that information and organization can be at cross-purposes in Shannon's scheme of things.This argument completely contradicts the notion of information of a system biologist who would argue that a biological organism contains information. It is by virtue of this propagating organization that an organism is able to grow and replicate, as pointed out by Kauffman [15] in Investigations. From the contradiction between Shannon and biotic information we already have a hint that there is possibly more than one type of information and that information is not an invariant like the speed of light in relativity theory, which is independent of its frame of reference. We also see that perhaps Shannon's definition of information might have limitations and might not represent an universal notion of information. After all Shannon formulated his concept of information as information entropy to solve a specific problem namely increasing the efficiency or the signal to noise ratio in the transmission of signals over telecommunication lines.在 POE 中，我们指出 Shannon [2] 经典的信息定义，即信息是减少不确定性的度量，对于传播其组织的生物系统并不适用。POE 的核心论点是 Shannon 信息「不适用于生物圈的进化」，因为达尔文的预适应是无法预测的，因此「无法计算可能性的集合及其熵 [1]。」所以，将信息定义为减少不确定性并没有意义，因为无论一个人从生物系统中的信息中学到多少，不确定性仍然是无限的，因为进化的可能性是无限且不可数的。需要提醒读者的是，Shannon 在定义信息时，假设可能的消息数量是有限的。相对于 Shannon 信息，我们定义了一种新的信息形式，称为指导信息或生命信息。这种信息形式不是通过 Shannon 的方法来定义，而是通过约束或边界条件来定义。信息量将与约束的多样性及其部分引发的过程多样性相关。通过这种方式，我们将信息的概念嵌入到生物圈的持续过程之中，因为这些过程对生物圈的发展具有因果关系。因此，我们得出结论，约束即信息，信息即约束。我们使用 "指导信息" 这个术语，是因为这种信息具有指导功能，有时我们也称其为 "生命信息"，因为它在生物领域中起作用，而不是在人类电信或计算机信息系统中发挥作用的 Shannon 信息 [1]。活的有机体是开放系统，von Bertalanffy [16] 将其定义为「一个与其环境进行物质交换的系统，即物质的输入输出和物质成分的建立与分解。」因此，教学信息或生物信息可以定义为这种能量和物质交换的组织方式。由于生物系统是开放系统，这一事实可以用于反对将教学信息或生物信息与控制论联系起来，因为控制论严格关注信息流动，而不处理能量和物质的流动。我们在 POE [1] 中认为，作为教学信息的约束对细胞的运作及其组织的传播至关重要。细胞的运作部分依赖于一个复杂的约束网络或边界条件，这些约束部分地指导或引发了细胞内发生的事件。重要的是，细胞中的传播性组织是约束作为教学信息的结构联合、受约束的能量释放作为工作、工作在信息副本构建中的使用、工作在其他结构构建中的使用以及进一步作为教学信息的约束构建。这种教学信息进一步以多种特定方式约束能量的进一步释放，所有这些过程都传播了一种完成任务闭合的组织，从而使细胞得以复制 [1]。我们在 POE [1] 中将生物信息或教学信息与生物智能体能够传播的组织联系起来。这与 Shannon 的信息定义和认为随机有机化学物质集合或汤比活有机体中结构化和组织化的有机化学物质集合具有更多 Shannon 信息的概念相矛盾。生物体比有机化学物质「汤」更有意义。然而，具有更多结构和组织的活体生物却包含更少的香农信息。这与生物学家对活体生物的理解是相违背的。因此，我们得出结论，使用香农信息来描述生物系统是不合适的。对于生物系统来说，香农信息的使用存在类别错误。活体生物具有意义，因为它是一个自主智能体，为自身利益而行动。而随机的有机化学物质「汤」既没有意义也没有组织 [1]。POE 分析揭示的关键点是，香农信息可以独立于意义来定义，而生物信息或指令信息则与生物体信息的意义密切相关，即其结构的传递。因此，我们将系统内的组织视为一种信息，这是一种比香农信息更为动态的信息概念，而香农信息仅仅是一串符号或比特。根据香农对信息的定义，一组随机数字通过电话线传输比同一线路上传输的一组偶数具有更多的信息。假设接收者是一个聪明的人，一旦接收到 2、4、6、8、10、12 之后，他们将能够正确猜测接下来的一组数字将是偶数。虽然随机数字没有组织，但偶数是有组织的。因此，香农信息的相关性变得更加复杂，因为在香农的体系中，我们必须得出一个反直觉的结论，即信息和组织在某些情况下可能是相互对立的。这个观点完全与系统生物学家的信息概念相矛盾，他们认为生物体内包含信息。正如 Kauffman 在《Investigations》中指出的那样[15]，正是这种信息的传播使得生物体能够生长和复制。从 Shannon 信息和生物信息的矛盾中，我们可以推测可能存在多种信息类型，并且信息不像相对论中的光速那样是一个不变的常数，不依赖于其参考系。我们还发现 Shannon 对信息的定义可能有其局限性，未必能代表普遍的信息概念。毕竟，Shannon 提出信息熵的概念是为了解决特定问题，即提高电信线路上信号传输的效率或信噪比。
