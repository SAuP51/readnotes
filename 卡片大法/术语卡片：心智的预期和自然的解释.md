But any man whose care and concern is not merely to be content with what has been discovered and make use of it, but to penetrate further; and not to defeat an opponent in argument but to conquer nature by action; and not to have nice, plausible opinions about things but sure, demonstrable knowledge; let such men (if they please), as true sons of the sciences, join with me, so that we may pass the ante-chambers of nature which innumerable others have trod, and eventually open up access to the inner rooms. For better understanding, and to make what we mean more familiar by assigning names, we have chosen to call the one way or method the Anticipation of the Mind [22] and the other the Interpretation of Nature.对于那些更倾向于并更接受第一种方法的人，无论是因为他们的急切，还是因为民事生活的需求，或是因为他们缺乏掌握另一种方法的智力能力，我们祈愿他们的活动顺利，如他们所愿，并且实现他们的追求。但对于那些不仅仅满足于利用已被发现的知识，而是要进一步深入探索；不是为了在辩论中战胜对手，而是通过行动征服自然；不是为了对事物有美妙、似是而非的观点，而是要有确定、可证实的知识的人；让这些人（如果他们愿意的话），作为真正的科学之子，与我一起，以便我们可以越过自然的前厅，这是无数人踏过的地方，并最终打开通往内部房间的通道。为了更好的理解，并通过赋予名称使我们的意图更加清晰，我们选择称其中一种方式或方法为心智的预期（Anticipation of the Mind）[22]，另一种为自然的解释（Interpretation of Nature）。
