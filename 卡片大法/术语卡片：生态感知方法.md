Gibson.(1979.2014).2024079The-Ecological-Approach-to-Visual-Perception.Psychology Press => Conclusion原文：I suggested in Chapter 14 that explanations of perception based on sensory inputs fail because they all come down to this: In order to perceive the world, one must already have ideas about it. Knowledge of the world is explained by assuming that knowledge of the world exists. Whether the ideas are learned or innate makes no difference; the fallacy lies in the circular reasoning.But if, on other hand, perception of the environment is not based on a sequence of snapshots but on invariant-extraction from a flux, one does not need to have ideas about the environment in order to perceive it. Another puzzle is resolved at the same time, the awareness of oneself in the environ- ment. The young child does not need to have ideas of space in order to see the surfaces around him; he need pay no attention to the cues for depth if he can see the layout: he need not compensate for the small retinal image of a distant surface if he never notices the image but only extracts the invariant.Such is the ecological approach to perception. It promises to simplify psycho- logy by making old puzzles disappear. Especially do all the genuinely mischief- making puzzles connected with the concept of an image become irrelevant. How can one see an upright world with an inverted retinal image? Why doesn't the object change when its retinal image is transposed over the retina? Where is the little man who looks at the image? If the two eyes yield a double image of a single object under some conditions, why not under all?The very notion of an image as a flattened-out object, a sort of pancake of a solid body, is shown to be misleading. It begins to appear that most of what has been written about pictures and images over the centuries is misleading, or hopelessly vague. We should forget it all and start fresh. The information for the perception of an object is not its image. The information in light to specify something does not have to resemble it, or copy it, or be a simulacrum or even an exact projection. Nothing is copied in the light to the eye of an observer, not the shape of a thing, not the surface of it, not its substance, not its color, and certainly not its motion. But all these things are specified in the light.我在第 14 章中提到，基于感觉输入的感知解释之所以失败，是因为它们都归结为一个问题：要感知世界，一个人必须已经对世界有了某种看法。对世界的知识被解释为已经存在的知识。无论这些想法是通过学习得来的还是天生的，这种循环推理都是谬误。但如果对环境的感知不是基于一系列的快照，而是从持续变化中提取不变性，那么一个人不需要对环境有任何预设的看法也能感知它。同时，另一个问题也得到了回答：个体对自己在环境中的意识。小孩子不需要有空间的概念就能看到周围的表面；如果他能够看到整体布局，就不需要关注深度线索；如果他不关注视网膜上的图像，而只是提取不变性，就不需要为远处物体的小视网膜图像进行补偿。这就是生态感知方法。它有望通过消除旧谜题来简化心理学。特别是那些与图像概念相关的难题变得不再重要。如何用倒置的视网膜图像看到正立的世界？为什么物体的视网膜图像在视网膜上移位时，物体不会改变？谁在看这些图像？为什么在某些条件下两只眼睛看到的单个物体会产生双重图像，而不是在所有条件下？认为图像是一个平面化的物体，就像一个固体的煎饼，这种概念实际上是误导性的。几百年来，关于图像和照片的许多论述都是不准确的，甚至是模糊不清的。我们应该抛开这些旧观念，重新出发。感知物体所需的信息并不是它的图像。光中的信息用来指示某物，不需要与它相似，不需要复制它，也不需要成为它的模拟或精确投影。观察者的眼睛并没有在光中复制任何东西，无论是物体的形状、表面、物质、颜色，还是运动，但所有这些信息都在光中得到了体现。
