Schematic summary of main elements of the multifactorial gene–environment interaction model (MGIM). At the phenotypic level (upper part), the MGIM assumes that psychological traits such as abilities, personality, interests, and motivation are associated with the domain and intensity of practice. Specific examples of variables that have been shown to be involved in various forms of expertise are provided in italics under each general heading. Practice will cause adaptations of neural mechanisms involved in expertise and can also influence relevant physical body properties. Furthermore, neural mechanisms related to trait differences may impact expertise independently of practice. Both genetic and nongenetic factors (lower part) influence the various variables that are involved in expertise at the phenotypic level. These influences are likely to be complex and involve both gene–environment interaction effects and covariation between genes and environment (G-E covariation).图 1. 多因素基因-环境互作模型（MGIM）的主要元素示意图。在表型层面（上部），MGIM 假定能力、个性、兴趣和动机等心理特质与练习的领域和强度有关。每个一般类别下的斜体字提供了涉及各种专业技能形式的变量的具体示例。练习会导致涉及专业技能的神经机制适应，并且也可能影响相关的身体特性。此外，与特质差异有关的神经机制可能独立于练习对专业技能产生影响。遗传和非遗传因素（下部）影响表型层面涉及专业技能的各种变量。这些影响可能很复杂，包括基因-环境互作效应和基因与环境之间的共变（G-E 共变）。Some general similarities between the MGIM and earlier theories of intellectual development should be mentioned. The potential roles of intelligence and interactions between intelligence and practice for the development of expert performance in the MGIM could be seen as generally similar to Cattell’s (1987) model of the development of specialized knowledge in his investment theory. An even closer relationship can been seen with Ackerman’s (1996) PPIK theory, in which adult intellectual development is modeled as a function of intelligence as process, personality, interests, and intelligence as knowledge. The MGIM focuses on the development of expert performance, rather than general intellectual development, but is similarly multifactorial and emphasizes that a wide range of both psychological and physical individual difference variables are likely to be important for expert skills, in a domainspecific way (Figure 1, upper part). A second important feature of the MGIM is that the development of expertise is regarded from a gene–environment interaction perspective, that is, genetic factors, nongenetic factors, and their interactions are considered as important influences on expert performance, deliberate practice, expertise-relevant traits, and their covariation (Figure 1, lower part).MGIM 与早期的智力发展理论之间有一些共通点值得一提。在 MGIM 中，智力的潜在作用及其与实践之间的交互作用对专家表现的发展产生的影响，与 Cattell（1987）在其投资理论中提出的专业知识发展模型大体相似。与 Ackerman（1996）的 PPIK 理论的关系更加密切，后者将成人智力发展建模为智力作为过程、个性、兴趣及智力作为知识的功能。MGIM 专注于专家表现的发展，而非广泛的智力发展，但同样采用了多因素的方法，并强调心理和生理上的个体差异因素对于专业技能的发展在特定领域内极为重要（如图 1 所示，上部分）。MGIM 的另一个重要特性是，将专业技能的发展视为基因与环境相互作用的结果，即遗传因素、非遗传因素及其相互作用对专家表现、有意识的训练、与专业相关的特质及其变化都有重要影响（如图 1 所示，下部分）。The role of deliberate practice in the MGIM and deliberate practice theory. It may be useful and prevent misunderstandings to begin with the points at which the MGIM and deliberate practice theory agree. One major point of agreement is that deliberate practice is important for expertise. There is ample empirical evidence that deliberate practice is an important predictor of expert performance, and in many domains, it may well turn out to be the most important single predictor, even when other variables are taken into account (Macnamara et al., 2014). The models also agree that one important reason for observed deliberate-practice/ expert-performance correlations is that deliberate practice has causal influences on expert performance. Practice may not make perfect, but it certainly helps. As detailed earlier, prolonged deliberate practice over months and years may lead to extensive anatomical and functional reorganizations of brain circuits that in turn underpin the often astonishing levels of domain-specific performance we see in experts. As discussed earlier, these reorganizations involve brain circuits that enable rapid and efficient interactions between LTM and WM (LTM–WM), as well as sensorimotor skills and optimized processing of domain-specific sensory information; deliberate practice can also modify some physical body properties, such as muscle strength, that are of importance for certain forms of expertise (see Figure 1). Deliberate practice theory and the MGIM agree in that expert performance is the consequence of specialization rather than improvements of general capacity; transfer effects of deliberate practice to nontrained tasks are often negligible.在 MGIM 与有意识训练理论中，有意识训练的角色值得特别提及。首先指出 MGIM 和有意识训练理论共同认可的观点，可以避免误解。两者都同意，有意识的训练对达到专家级表现至关重要。大量实证研究表明，有意识的训练是预测专家表现的一个重要因素，在许多领域中，它甚至可能是最重要的单一预测因素（Macnamara 等人，2014）。这些模型还一致认为，有意识训练与专家表现之间观察到的相关性的一个重要原因是有意识训练对专家表现有直接的因果关系。虽然练习可能无法达到完美，但确实大有裨益。正如前面讨论的，长期持续的有意识训练，可能导致大脑回路的广泛解剖学和功能重组，进而支撑专家在特定领域达到惊人的表现水平。这些重组涉及的大脑回路，不仅使长期记忆与工作记忆（LTM-WM）之间能够快速、高效地交互，还涉及感官运动技能和特定领域感觉信息的优化处理；有意识训练还能改变某些对特定专业技能重要的身体属性，比如肌肉力量（如图 1 所示）。有意识训练理论和 MGIM 共同认为，专家级表现是专业化的结果，而非一般能力的提升；有意识训练对未训练任务的迁移效果通常微乎其微。This stated, the two models also differ in their view of deliberate practice in several important ways. The MGIM emphasizes that deliberate practice cannot be seen as an entirely environmental phenomenon: Engagement in deliberate practice is not a way to “circumvent” genetic limitations. Rather, behavior genetic studies strongly suggest that the quantity, and presumably also quality, of deliberate practice is itself subject to substantial genetic influences. Although deliberate practice certainly has causal influences on expert performance, recent data on musical expert performance show that reverse causality and genetic pleiotropy should be taken as serious empirical possibilities: For both musical discrimination ability (Mosing, Madison, et al., 2014) and accuracy of motor timing (Ullén et al., 2015), it has recently been demonstrated that associations with musical practice are driven essentially by common genetic factors rather than causal effects of practice.然而，这两种模型在对刻意练习的理解上存在几个关键的差异。MGIM 指出，刻意练习不仅仅是环境因素的体现，参与刻意练习并不能简单地绕过遗传的限制。行为遗传学的研究强烈提示，刻意练习的数量，很可能还包括质量，本身就受到显著的遗传影响。虽然刻意练习确实会对专业表现产生因果作用，但最新的关于音乐专业表现的研究表明，我们应当认真对待反向因果关系和遗传多样性作为实证研究的可能性。无论是音乐鉴别能力（Mosing, Madison 等，2014 年）还是运动定时的准确性（Ullén 等人，2015 年），近期的研究都表明，与音乐练习的关联主要是由共有的遗传因素驱动，而非练习的直接影响。Finally, an important feature of the MGIM is that deliberate practice can be influenced in various ways by variables (abilities, personality, interests, motivation) that potentially impact which domain an individual elects to invest time in, as well as the intensity and quality of the practice itself. Figure 1 provides specific empirically supported examples of such influences (see earlier sections): Both grit and openness have been shown to be associated with the amount of deliberate practice in different domains (Butkovic et al., 2015; Duckworth et al., 2011). For the domain of music, impulsivity has been shown to influence practice quality (Miksza, 2006, 2011). For a general discussion of relations between interests, personality, abilities, and domain of expertise, see, for example, Ackerman (1996), Ackerman et al. (2011), and Kell et al. (2013).最后，MGIM 的一个显著特点是，刻意练习受到多种因素的影响，这些因素（如能力、个性、兴趣、动机）可能决定个人选择投入时间的领域，以及练习的强度和质量。图 1 展示了这种影响的具体实证例证（详见前文）：例如，坚韧和开放性已被证明与在不同领域进行刻意练习的量相关联（Butkovic 等，2015 年；Duckworth 等，2011 年）。在音乐领域，冲动性被发现会影响练习的质量（Miksza，2006 年，2011 年）。关于兴趣、个性、能力与专业领域之间关系的更广泛讨论，可以参考 Ackerman（1996 年）、Ackerman 等人（2011 年）和 Kell 等人（2013 年）的工作。The MGIM at the phenotypic level. An essential difference between deliberate practice theory and the MGIM is that latter assumes, as a central tenet of the model, that expert performance can be influenced directly by a number of other variables than practice. As discussed in the previous section, it appears important to consider a wide range of individual difference variables for expertise, above and beyond effects of practice. These could potentially include different modalities of psychological individual differences—abilities, personality, interests, social attitudes, motivational variables—as well as physical traits (Figure 1, upper part). It appears inevitable that the importance of individual variables will show considerable variation across domains. As summarized earlier, there is clear evidence that, even at high levels of expertise, intelligence and related constructs such as WM are of importance for domains that require the processing of complex and novel information. This includes musical expertise (Meinz & Hambrick, 2010) and chess (Grabner, 2014), and is further corroborated by the general observation that individual differences in spatial and verbal cognitive abilities predict domain-specific performance and achievement, even at the highest levels of intelligence (Kell et al., 2013). Physical traits will matter primarily for forms of expert performance that involve sensorimotor acts: Height and body size are, for example, important for many sports (Ericsson, 2007; Ericsson et al., 1993), whereas biomechanical properties of the hand are importance for instrumental musicians. An important general feature of the MGIM framework is thus that the role of variables other than deliberate practice for expertise may vary between domains.在 MGIM 的表型层面，与刻意练习理论的一大区别在于，MGIM 认为专家表现不仅仅受到练习的影响，还直接受到许多其他变量的影响，这是该模型的核心观点。正如前文所讨论的，重要的是要考虑到影响专业性的广泛个体差异，这些差异不仅仅是练习的效果。这包括各种心理个体差异的形式 —— 能力、个性、兴趣、社会态度、动机变量 —— 以及身体特征（如图 1 所示，上部分）。显而易见，个体变量的重要性在不同领域会有显著的差异。正如之前总结的，即便是在高水平的专业性中，智力及其相关构造比如工作记忆对于那些需要处理复杂和新奇信息的领域来说至关重要。这包括音乐专业性（Meinz & Hambrick，2010 年）和象棋（Grabner，2014 年），并且通过普遍观察得到进一步证实：在最高智力水平上，空间和言语认知能力的个体差异预测了特定领域的表现和成就（Kell 等人，2013 年）。身体特征主要影响那些涉及感觉运动行为的专家表现形式，例如，身高和体型对许多体育运动很重要（Ericsson，2007 年；Ericsson 等，1993 年），手的生物力学属性对乐器演奏者而言至关重要。因此，MGIM 框架的一个关键特征是，除了刻意练习外，其他变量在不同领域对专家表现的作用可能会有所不同。A second general point is that relations between expert performance and predictor variables are likely to be complex and involve multiplicative as well as additive effects. To give one example, it appears plausible that deliberate practice could interact with intelligence and personality. As discussed previously, deliberate practice would be expected to load strongly on cognitive mechanisms such as attention and metacognition. Not least for cognitively demanding domains, it thus appears possible that the effect of each hour of deliberate practice varies as a function of intelligence—in other words, that there is an interaction between deliberate practice and intelligence. Furthermore, studies on musicians have found relations between personality (impulsivity) and practicing habits (Miksza, 2006, 2011); this suggests the possibility of interactions between deliberate practice and personality.另一个普遍的观点是，专家表现与预测变量之间的关系可能很复杂，可能涉及乘法效应以及加法效应。例如，刻意练习可能与智力和个性产生交互作用似乎是合理的。正如之前讨论的，刻意练习预期会强烈依赖认知机制，比如注意力和元认知。尤其是在认知要求高的领域，每个小时的刻意练习效果可能随智力而异 —— 换句话说，刻意练习和智力之间存在交互作用是有可能的。此外，对音乐家的研究发现个性（如冲动性）与练习习惯之间存在关系（Miksza，2006 年，2011 年），这暗示了刻意练习与个性之间也可能存在交互作用。Such nonlinear relationships are also of interest in relation to the exceptional achievements of prodigies and eminent creators, compared with individuals with comparable levels of deliberate practice. These provide yet another anomaly for deliberate practice theory, whereas it would seem that they can be readily explained within the MGIM if performance is assumed to depend on both additive effects and multiplicative interactions between deliberate practice and other variables (Lykken, 2005; Mosing & Ullén, in press; Simonton, 1984).这种非线性的关系在考虑到天才和杰出创造者的非凡成就时尤其引人注目，这些成就与具有相似刻意练习水平的个体相比显得异常。这对刻意练习理论构成了挑战，而在 MGIM 框架下，如果认为表现是刻意练习与其他变量之间加法效应和乘法交互作用的结果，这些现象似乎可以得到顺畅的解释（Lykken，2005 年；Mosing & Ullén，即将发表；Simonton，1984 年）。The MGIM: Genetic perspectives. A major reason for the shortcomings of deliberate practice theory is its extreme environmentalist perspective. In contrast, the MGIM assumes—on the basis of both available data and theoretical considerations—that genetic factors are likely to be important for expertise in a number of ways (see Figure 1, lower part). First, one should consider practice-independent genetic effects on traits that are relevant for expert performance. One obvious variable of interest in this context is intelligence, which is highly heritable (Jensen, 1998; Plomin & Spinath, 2004), and likely to be important for many forms of expert performance, even at high levels of deliberate practice (see previous sections). Many genetic effects on anthropometric properties are also likely to fall in this category. Training-independent genetic effects should also be considered in relation to more narrow abilities of relevance for expert performance. One alreadymentioned example is musical discrimination, which shows a genetic overlap with intelligence as well as more specific genetic influences (Mosing, Pedersen, et al., 2014).MGIM 从遗传学角度来看，刻意练习理论的局限性主要源于其过分强调环境因素的观点。与之形成对比的是，MGIM 基于现有的数据和理论分析，假设遗传因素在多个方面对成为专家至关重要（参见图 1，下部）。首先，我们应当关注与练习无关的遗传效应对专家表现的影响，其中智力是一个关键变量，因为它的高遗传性（Jensen，1998 年；Plomin & Spinath，2004 年）意味着它对各种专家表现形式都极为重要，即便在高强度的刻意练习情境下也是如此（参见前文讨论）。此外，对人体测量属性的许多遗传效应也可能与此相关。与专家表现相关的更为特定能力的独立于训练的遗传效应同样值得关注。如前所提，音乐辨别能力就是一个例子，它不仅与智力有遗传重叠，还受到更具体遗传因素的影响（Mosing, Pedersen 等，2014）。Other genetic factors will affect expert performance through their effects on deliberate practice and its covariates. This suggests that the genetic architecture of expert performance may be different at different levels of deliberate practice. Indeed, preliminary findings support that the heritability of expert performance may actually increase rather than decrease with deliberate practice, contrary to predictions of deliberate practice theory (Hambrick & Tucker-Drob, 2015). More generally, this also highlights the potential importance of more complex interplay between genes and environment—that is, gene–environment interactions (Kennedy et al., 2011; Schellenberg, 2015) and various forms of geneenvironment covariation (Scarr, 1996), for expertise.其他遗传因素可能通过影响刻意练习及其相关变量来影响专家表现。这表明，在不同水平的刻意练习中，专家表现的遗传构造可能会有所不同。实际上，初步研究发现，与刻意练习理论的预期相反，专家表现的遗传性可能随着刻意练习的增加而增加，而不是减少（Hambrick & Tucker-Drob，2015）。更广泛地说，这突显了基因与环境之间更为复杂的相互作用的重要性，即基因-环境互动（Kennedy 等人，2011 年；Schellenberg，2015 年）以及基因环境共变的各种形式（Scarr，1996 年），对于专业性来说至关重要。
