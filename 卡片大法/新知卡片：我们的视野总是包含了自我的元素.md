The important fact about a field of view is its boundaries. vague and indefinite boundaries. to be sure, but still boundaries. They are in some ways like occluding edges, the occluding edges of a window. The edges of the field of view hide the environment behind them. as those of a window do. and when the field moves there is an accretion of optical structure at the leading edge with deletion of structure at the trailing edge, as in the cabin of a steam shovel with a wide front window and controls that enable the operator to turn the cabin to the right or the left. But the edges of the field of view are unlike the edges of a window inasmuch as, for the window, a foreground hides the background whereas, for the field of view, the head of the observer hides the background. Ask yourself what it is that you see hiding the surroundings as you look out upon the world-not darkness surely, not air, not nothing, but the ego! The illustration of course is misleading in this respect.Whenever a point of observation is occupied by a human, about half of the surrounding world is revealed to the eyes and the remainder is concealed by the head. What is concealed is occluded not by a surface, a projected surface of the sort described when the laws of occluding and occluded surfaces were formulated, but by a unique entity. It is not a part of the world, but it does conform to the principle of reversible occlusion, by which those surfaces that go out of sight with one movement come back into sight with the opposite movement. The head turns. and whatever was in back of the head at one time will be in front of the head at another and vice versa. This fact is fundamental for the theory of perception to be proposed. The purpose of vision, I shall argue, is to be aware of the surroundings, the ambient environment, not merely of the field in front of the eyes. The ambient information is always available to any observer who turns his or her head. Visual perception is panoramic and, over time, the panorama is registered.There are other remarkable features of the field of view besides its oval boundaries. Still other occluding edges appear within it, those of the nose, the body, the limbs, and the extremities, some of which can be seen in the drawing. The edges of the eye socket, the eyebrows, the nose and cheek bones are only the nearest: the edges of the arms. legs. hands. and feet are more distant. but they still occlude the surfaces of the "outer"environment. The hands and feet behave more like the occluding edges of an object than like the occluding edges of a window; they are actually protrusions into the field of view from below. They are therefore attached objects in the present terminology, but they are attached to the observer, not to the ground, and they are elastic. When these semiobjects move, there is deletion of optical structure at the leading edge and accretion at the trailing edge, just as with objects in the world.想象一下，你的视野就像是一个巨大的、形状不规则的窗口，通过它你观察这个世界。这个「窗口」的边缘虽然模糊不清，但确实存在。这些边缘在某种程度上类似于真实窗户的边框，它们遮挡了窗外的景象。当我们转动头部时，视野边缘的景象会发生变化：新的景象会从一侧出现，而另一侧的景象则会消失。这种体验有点像坐在一台带有宽大前窗的挖掘机驾驶舱里，操作员可以左右转动驾驶舱，从而改变视野。然而，视野的边缘与真实窗户的边框有一个关键区别：窗户边框之外是我们能看到的景象，而视野边缘之外则是被我们的头部遮挡的部分。想象一下，当你环顾四周时，是什么在遮挡周围的环境？不是黑暗，不是空气，也不是虚无，而是你自己！这就是为什么我们的视野总是包含了「自我」的元素。每当我们观察周围环境时，大约有一半的世界呈现在我们眼前，而另一半则被我们的头部遮挡。这种遮挡不同于普通物体对其他物体的遮挡，因为我们的头部是一个独特的实体。它虽然不是我们所观察的世界的一部分，但它遵循一个有趣的原则：当我们转动头部时，原本被遮挡的部分会重新出现在视野中，而原本可见的部分则会被遮挡。这个现象对于我们理解视觉感知非常重要。我认为，视觉的主要目的是让我们意识到整个周围环境，而不仅仅是眼前的景象。通过转动头部，我们可以获取全方位的环境信息。随着时间的推移，我们的大脑会将这些片段信息整合成一个完整的全景图像。除了视野的整体边界外，我们的视野中还存在其他有趣的「遮挡者」。比如我们的鼻子、身体、四肢等。在图中，我们可以看到最接近的遮挡者包括眼窝边缘、眉毛、鼻子和颧骨。稍远一些的是我们的手臂、腿、手和脚，它们同样会遮挡部分外部环境。有趣的是，我们的手和脚在视野中的表现更像是独立的物体，而不是固定的边框。它们就像是从视野下方伸出的突起物。在我们当前的讨论中，我们可以将它们视为「附属物体」—— 它们附属于观察者（也就是我们自己），而不是附属于地面，并且它们是可以弯曲移动的。当这些身体部位移动时，我们会看到它们遮挡和露出背景的过程，就像我们观察外部世界中的物体移动一样。通过理解我们的视野及其特性，我们可以更好地认识到我们是如何感知这个世界的，以及我们的身体如何影响这种感知。这不仅帮助我们理解视觉系统的工作原理，也让我们更深入地认识到「自我」在我们世界观中的独特地位。
