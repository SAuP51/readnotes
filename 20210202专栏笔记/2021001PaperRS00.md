### 0101. 主题卡 —— 智慧工厂的 autonomy and sociality

摘自「2021005Implementing-Smart-Factory-of-Industrie-4.0-An-Outlook.md」2016 年 1 月发表的论文

From the perspective of control engineer, the smart factory can be viewed as a closedloop system, as shown in Figure 3. In the center of the control loop is the network of smart artifacts. The smart artifact has 3C capabilities, and beyond this, it has autonomy and sociality. By autonomy, we mean that the smart artifact makes decisions by itself; no other entities can directly control its behavior. By sociality, we mean that the smart artifacts understand a common set of knowledge and follow a common set of rules for negotiation. Therefore, a society of smart artifacts can yield a highly flexible manufacturing system, that is, a self-organized and reconfigurable system that seems to be humanoid or smart.

The smart artifacts are fundamental components of smart factory. While today’s computer numerical control (CNC) machines generally have 3C capabilities, the smart machines should have additional autonomy and sociality capabilities. This means the smart machines can make decisions by themselves instead of being directly instructed, and they can negotiate with each other and with the smart products. Therefore, the autonomy and sociality capabilities are the key enablers for the implementation of a self-organized manufacturing system. The research on MAS that is a branch of AI technology can provide some useful results such as the ontology method and the contract net protocol (CNP) [28]. However, further research is still needed to achieve the autonomous manufacturing system architecture instead of hierarchical or mediator ones.

摘自「2021007SmartFactory-Towards-a-factory-of-things.md」2010 年 3 月发表的论文

Despite the success stories already discussed, it is still a long and winding road from the vision to the reality of a smart factory, but just as it is constantly being walked by the consumer product engineers, it must also be taken by the factory planners. Adopting the basic principles of the internet-of-things we should talk about a factory-of-things as a vision for our future factories. The factory-of-things will be composed of smart objects which interact based on semantic services. There will be no hierarchy in the traditional sense instead the objects will self-organize to fulﬁl a certain task. But to achieve this goal there are multi-dimensional problems to be solved.

### 0102. 主题卡 —— 智慧工厂要回答的三个问题

摘自「2021008Smart-Factory-A-Step-towards-the-Next-Generation-of-Manufacturing.md」2008 年 1 月发表的论文

The Smart Factory concept enables the real-time collection, distribution and access of manufacturing relevant information anytime and anywhere. The Smart Factory represents a realtime, context-sensitive manufacturing environment that can handle turbulences in production using decentralized information and communication structures for an optimum management of production processes. Premises for further assistance than today are the horizontal and vertical integration of information systems, the assignment of material and flow of information within an enterprise. For acting context-aware, the applications in the Smart factory have to answer the following three questions, from those deriving more challenges:

1 How is an object identified? => Identification phase

2 Where is an object located into the factory? => Positioning phase

3 What is the situation or status of an object? => Status knowledge

2『感觉这的信息就是论文的核心，智慧工厂要回答的三个问题，做一张主题卡片。（2021-01-28）』

These and further challenges are shortly presented:

Identification: The Identification of objects, as one of the basic challenges in a factory, assigns information of the virtual world like process steps to real world objects. Therefore suitable identification methods, tags, sensors, sensor readers and communication facilities have to be found and chosen, specific to their task in a rough industrial environment.

Localization: For improving the processes and reducing idle times within the Smart Factory the localization is required to have an actual knowledge about the position of the objects like tools or materials. Depending on the purpose, the accuracy of a positioning system has to be a range within 0.15-1m. Furthermore a positioning system used in a manufacturing environment has to work on a large scale and has to be robust against environmental influences, electromagnetic fields, noise of dust, etc. [3].

Status knowledge: The assistance systems in a Smart Factory have to know the status or situation of the objects in order to provide users the context-aware information.

Update of smart management systems: Current object information like the status or location has to be communicated to the systems of the Smart Factory. As an example the highly dynamical data like the position of an object should be updated every 10 to 30 seconds [3].

Support for different queries: Assistance systems in the Smart Factory have to support different kinds of queries [3]. We can differentiate into object-based, location-based/spatial, temporal and combinations of the previous types of queries.

Integration of heterogeneous information: The integration challenge of different systems in an enterprise is caused by different information models, interfaces and data formats. In order to provide other systems easy accessible information, different systems have to be integrated into a common synchronizing platform.

Real-time characterized reaction: For supporting people and machines information has to be provided within seconds. This challenge addresses mainly communications technologies and database management.

Therefore, the industry needs a radical change and it is the Industrie 4.0 that addresses this change. The core idea of Industrie 4.0 is to use the emerging information technologies to implement IoT and services so that business process and engineering process are deeply integrated making production operate in a flexible, efficient, and green way with constantly high quality and low cost.

### 0202. 术语卡 —— 3C

computing, communication, and control.

Some emerging information technologies, such as IoT, big data, and cloud computing as well as artificial intelligence (AI) technologies (e.g., MAS) are enabling factors of Industrie 4.0. Integrating these technologies with industrial automation, business, and trade is able to achieve a huge improvement of industry. With powerful microprocessors and AI technologies, the products and machines become smart in the sense that they not only have abilities of computing, communication, and control (3C) but also have autonomy and sociality. With the support of industrial networks, these smart artifacts are interconnected with each other and with the Internet. With the cloud computing technology, the server network can be virtualized as a resource pool that can provide scalable computing ability and storage space on demand for big data analytics. With numerous information systems deployed on cloud and smart things connected to the same cloud, a novel world of IoT and services is created.

### 0203. 术语卡 —— Lean Production

The production plants also become ever more complex despite all efforts at improving this situation. This in turn, results in longer planning phases and unacceptably long times-to-market. At this point, let's look back to 20 years ago. In the 1980s, we witnessed the first wave of integration of IT technologies into the factories computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), as it was called then The hope was that fully automated plants would solve cost and quality problems on the basis of state-of-the-art computer technology. Since humans would no longer fit in there, the visions of the future then aimed at deserted factories with no human workers. The reality arrived quite differently than imagined. These CIM systems were extremely complex in planning as well as in construction, operation, and maintenance. The technologies were not yet mature and the humans were overstrained. At the beginning of the 90's, when the crisis was obvious, a milestone was represented by the popular book by Womack, Jones and Roos: The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production  (Womack, Jones, Roos, 1991), Which explained to the high-tech addicts in the western industry, how Toyota was able to build high quality automobiles with very simple production principles. These principles were known from then on as lean production, which became the paradigm of the beginning decade.

Lean production meant networks, not hierarchies; dynamic, self-coordinating work teams instead of monotonous assembly line jobs; and, most importantly, the personal responsibility of the individual worker. But this philosophy is directed primarily on the organization and less on the technologies.

摘自「2021008Smart-Factory-A-Step-towards-the-Next-Generation-of-Manufacturing.md」2008 年 1 月发表的论文

The downscaling of computer and sensor technologies supports the integration of knowledge at all scales of a holistic production system, aiming at increasing the transformability of the factory as a whole. The presented Smart Factory approach represents a real-time, context sensitive manufacturing environment that can handle turbulences in production using decentralized information and communication structures for an optimum management of Production processes. Based on the Nexus Platform it integrates heterogeneous information systems in manufacturing enterprise both horizontal (e. G. Between systems in the shop floor) and vertical (e. G. Between shop floor and management systems like ERP or MES) in order to reduce information deficits. In the framework of the research area Smart Factory at the Universitat Stuttgart, IFF, a Smart Factory environment has been developed and will be enhanced, aiming at implementing the vision of the next-generation real-time and context-aware production systems.
