— or how to communicate with engineers

As men journeyed in the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, ' Come, let us make bricks and bake them hard'; they used bricks for stones and bitumen for mortar. ' Come, ' they said, ' let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and make a name for ourselves; or we shall be dispersed all over the earth.' Then the Lord came down to see the city and tower which mortal men had built, and he said, 'Here they are, one people with a single language, and now they have started to do this; henceforward nothing they have a mind to do will be beyond their reach. Come, let us go down there and confuse their speech, so that they will not understand what they say to one another.' So the Lord dispersed them from there all over the earth, and they left off building the city. That is why it is called Babel (that is, Babylon), because the Lord there made a babble of the language of all the world.

Genesis 11.2–9 (New English Bible)

A structure has been defined as 'any assemblage of materials which is intended to sustain loads', and the study of structures is one of the traditional branches of science. If an engineering structure breaks, people are likely to get killed, and so engineers do well to investigate the behaviour of structures with circumspection. But, unfortunately, when they come to tell other people about their subject, something goes badly wrong, for they talk in a strange language, and some of us are left with the conviction that the study of structures and the way in which they carry loads is incomprehensible, irrelevant and very boring indeed.

Yet structures are involved in our lives in so many ways that we cannot really afford to ignore them: after all, every plant and animal and nearly all of the works of man have to sustain greater or less mechanical forces without breaking, and so practically everything is a structure of one kind or another. When we talk about structures we shall have to ask, not only why buildings and bridges fall down and why machinery and aeroplanes sometimes break, but also how worms came to be the shape they are and why a bat can fly into a rose-bush without tearing its wings. How do our tendons work? Why do we get 'lumbago'? How were pterodactyls able to weigh so little? Why do birds have feathers? How do our arteries work? What can we do for crippled children? Why are sailing ships rigged in the way they are? Why did the bow of Odysseus have to be so hard to string? Why did the ancients take the wheels off their chariots at night? How did a Greek catapult work? Why is a reed shaken by the wind and why is the Parthenon so beautiful? Can engineers learn from natural structures? What can doctors and biologists and artists and archaeologists learn from engineers?

As it has turned out, the struggle to understand the real reasons why structures work and why things break has been a great deal more difficult and has taken much longer than one might have expected. It is really only quite recently that we have been able to fill in enough of the gaps in our knowledge to answer some of these questions in any very useful or intelligent manner. Naturally, as more of the bits of the jig-saw puzzle are assembled, the general picture becomes clearer: the whole subject is becoming less a study for rather narrow specialists and more one which the ordinary person can find rewarding and relevant to a wide range of general interests.

This book is about modern views on the structural element in Nature, in technology and in everyday life. We shall discuss the ways in which the need to be strong and to support various necessary loads has influenced the development of all sorts of creatures and devices – including man.

如何与工程师无障碍地沟通

人们向东迁徙的时候，在示拿地遇见一片平原，便定居在那里。他们互相商量：「来吧，让我们制作砖块，把砖烧透了。」他们就以砖块为石，又以柏油为浆。「来吧，」他们说，「让我们为自己建造一座城和一座塔，塔顶通天，传扬我们的声名，免得我们流散到四面八方。」耶和华降临，要看看凡人所建造的城和塔。耶和华说：「他们在此，为同一种族，用同一语言，如今他们已开始如此行事，此后他们意欲所为便没有办不到的了。来吧，让我们下凡去那儿，搅乱他们的言说，使他们彼此无法沟通。」于是，耶和华使他们从那里流散到四面八方，他们便停止造城了。这就是为何那里被叫作巴别（即巴比伦），因为上帝在那儿搅乱了世间的语言。

——《圣经·旧约全书·创世记》（Genesis 11: 2-9）

结构曾被定义为任何用于承受载荷的材料的组合，而研究结构是科学的传统分支之一。如果一个工程结构倒塌，就可能出现人员伤亡，因此工程师务必小心谨慎地探究结构的行为。然而遗憾的是，当工程师要向大家普及他们的专业时，麻烦就来了：他们总是说着奇怪的用语，于是一些人便会认为，研究结构及其负载的方式的确令人费解、无关紧要，也非常无聊。

但是，结构无处不在，我们实在没法视而不见：毕竟，所有动植物以及几乎所有的人造物都必须能够承受某种强度的机械性力量而不致损坏，所以实际上，万物皆有结构。当我们谈论结构时，我们不仅要问为何建筑和桥梁不会坍塌，机器和飞机为何有时会坏掉，还需要问蠕虫为何长成那种形态，以及蝙蝠为什么能飞过玫瑰花丛而保持翅膀完好无损。我们的肌腱如何工作？我们为何会「腰酸背痛」？翼手龙的体重怎么那么轻？鸟类为何有羽毛？我们的动脉如何工作？我们能为残疾儿童做些什么？为什么帆船要那样装配帆索？为什么奥德修斯之弓很难拉开？为什么古人晚上要把战车的轮子卸下来？希腊投石机如何工作？为什么芦苇会随风摇曳？为什么帕提侬神庙如此壮美？工程师能从天然结构中得到什么启示？医生、生物学家、艺术家和考古学家能从工程师那儿学到些什么？

事实表明，理解结构的原理和损坏的原因是一场斗争，其艰难与漫长远非常人所能预料。直到最近，我们才补上了所欠的知识，使得我们能以某些有效或巧妙的办法回答上述一部分问题。当然，随着将更多块拼图汇集组装，整个图景越发清晰：这门学科整体上不再局限于专业研究的狭窄范围，而越发贴近大众的普遍利益，普通人从中也能有所收获。

本书讲述了关于自然界、工程技术和日常生活中的结构元素的现代观点，探讨了对强度及支持不同载荷的需求如何影响各种生命体和机械装置的发展，包括人的进化。

### 1.1 The living structure

Biological structures came into being long before artificial ones. Before there was life in the world, there was no such thing as a purposive structure of any kind – only mountains and heaps of sand and rock. Even a very simple and primitive kind of life is a delicately balanced, self-perpetuating chemical reaction which needs to be separated and guarded from non-life. Nature having invented life – and with it individualism – it became necessary to devise some kind of container in which to keep it. This film or membrane had to have at least a minimum of mechanical strength, both to contain the living matter and also to give it some protection from outside forces.

If, as seems possible, some of the earliest forms of life consisted of tiny droplets floating in water, then a very weak and simple barrier, perhaps no more than the surface tension which exists at the interfaces between different liquids, may have sufficed. Gradually, as living creatures multiplied, life became more competitive, and the weak, globular and immobile animals were at a disadvantage. Skins became tougher and various means of locomotion were evolved. Larger, multicellular animals appeared which could bite and could swim fast. Survival became a matter of chasing and being chased, eating and being eaten. Aristotle called this allelophagia – a mutual eating – Darwin called it natural selection. In any case, progress in evolution was dependent upon the development of stronger biological materials and more ingenious living structures.

The earlier and more primitive animals were mostly made from soft materials because they not only make it much easier to wriggle and extend oneself in various ways, but soft tissues are usually tough (as we shall see), while rigid ones like bone are often brittle. Furthermore, the use of rigid materials imposes all kinds of difficulties in connection with growth and reproduction. As women know, the business of giving birth involves an engineering of high strains and large deflections. All the same, the development of the vertebrate foetus from conception onwards, like that of natural structures in general, is in certain respects from soft to hard, and the hardening process goes on after the baby has emerged.

One gets the impression that Nature has accepted the use of stiff materials rather reluctantly, but, as animals got bigger and came out of the water on to the land, most of them developed and exploited rigid skeletons, teeth and sometimes horns and armour. Yet animals never became predominantly rigid devices like most modern machinery. The skeleton usually remained but a small part of the whole, and, as we shall see, the soft parts were frequently used in clever ways to limit the loads upon the skeleton and thus to protect it from the consequences of its brittleness.

While the bodies of most animals are made preponderantly from flexible materials, this is not always true for plants. The smaller and more primitive plants are usually soft, but a plant cannot chase its food, nor can it run away from an enemy. It can, however, protect itself to some extent by growing tall, and, by doing so, it may also be able to get more than its fair share of sun and rain. Trees, in particular, seem to be extraordinarily clever at stretching out to collect the diffuse and fitful energy of sunlight and at the same time standing up to being bullied by the wind -and all in the most cost-effective way. The tallest trees reach a height of about 360 feet or 110 metres, being by far the largest and most durable of living structures. For a plant to reach even a tenth of this height, however, its main structure needs to be both light and rigid; we shall see later that it incorporates a number of important lessons for engineers.

It may seem obvious that questions like these about strength and flexibility and toughness are relevant in medicine and in zoology and botany, yet for a long time both doctors and biologists resisted all such ideas with considerable success and with the whole force of their emotions. Of course, it is partly a matter of temperament and partly a matter of language, and perhaps a dislike and fear of the mathematical concepts of the engineer may have had something to do with the matter. Too often biologists simply cannot bring themselves to make a sufficiently serious study of the structural aspects of their problems. Yet there can be no reason to assume that,, while Nature uses methods of infinite subtlety in her chemistry and her control mechanisms, her structural approach should be a crude one.

生物的结构

生物学结构的出现远早于人工结构。在生命出现之前，世界上不存在任何形式的目的性结构，只有山岳和成堆的沙石。即使是非常简单、原始的生命形态，也形成了一种微妙的平衡，其化学反应自发产生且不断延续，你要将其与非生命体分隔开，并防止其受到侵害。大自然创造了生命，并让其自生自灭，所以有必要设计出某种容器以使之存续。这样的薄层或薄膜至少要具备最低限度的机械强度，且要容纳生命物质，还要保护其免遭外力的侵袭。

在可能的条件下，某些最早的生命形态是由在水中游荡的微滴构成的，那么一个非常脆弱且简单的屏障，或许仅仅靠不同液体间界面上存在的表面张力，就已经够用了。渐渐地，随着生物形态日趋繁复，生命的竞争越发激烈，弱小、无法自主运动的球状生物将会处于不利的地位。生物的表皮变得越来越坚韧，各种各样的运动形式层出不穷。更大的多细胞动物出现了，它们会撕咬，并快速游动。生存的要义变成了追逐与被追逐，吃与被吃。亚里士多德称之为「allelophagia」，即相互吞噬，达尔文则称之为自然选择。不管怎样，进化的历程取决于更强生物材料和更精妙活体结构的发展。

早期更原始的动物大多是由软材料构成的，不仅因为这样的材料能使之更易扭动且能任意延展自身，还因为这些软组织通常是坚韧的（正如我们将要看到的），而像骨骼这样的刚性结构却往往是脆弱的。此外，刚性材料的运用会给生长和繁殖带来各种各样的麻烦。女士们都知道，生产是一项涉及高应变和大挠度的大工程。尽管如此，但脊椎动物从受精卵发育到胎儿的过程，就像普遍的天然结构一样，在某些方面是从软变硬的过程，而且在婴儿出生后，这个硬化过程仍在持续。

这给人的感觉像是大自然很不情愿地接受了强劲的材料，然而当动物越来越大时，它们从水中登上陆地，大多数长出且用上了刚性的骨架和牙齿，有些还有硬角和甲壳。但是，动物绝对不会变成像大部分现代机械那样以刚性装置为主导。骨骼通常只占全身的一小部分，下面我们将会看到，那些软的部分常常巧妙地减轻了骨骼上的负荷，使之免受折断之苦。

大多数动物的躯体主要是由柔性材料构成的，而植物则并不总是如此。那些更小且更原始的植物通常是软的，所以植物既不能追捕其食物，也没法躲避其天敌。然而在某种程度上，它可以通过长高来自保，并争夺更多的阳光雨露。尤其是树木，它们十分巧妙地伸展，既能收集散布在空中的若隐若现的阳光，又能挺立直面狂风的威胁，当然，是以最节能的方式。最高的树能长到约 110 米，这是迄今最大且最结实的活体结构。然而，一株植物即使只长到上述高度的 1/10，其主体结构也需轻巧又有刚性，我们将在后文看到这为工程师提供了许多重要的经验。

很明显，像这样关于强度、柔度和韧度的问题遍布医学和动植物学等领域，然而长期以来，医生和生物学家都排斥这些观念，他们仰仗的是在这些领域的巨大成就和专业自尊。当然，这一方面关乎性格，另一方面关乎语言，或许工程师对数学概念的厌恶和畏惧也与此有关。在绝大多数情况下，从结构的角度研究动植物，确实是生物学家无法胜任的工作。但是我们也没有道理假定大自然在其化学与控制机制上精雕细琢，而在结构上却粗制滥造。

### 1.2 The technological structure

Wonders there are many, but there is no wonder

Wilder than man –

Man who makes the winds of winter bear him,

Through the trough of waves that tower about him,

Across grey wastes of sea;

Man who wearies the Untiring, the Immortal–

Earth, eldest of the Gods, as year by year,

His plough teams come and go.

The care-free bands of birds,

Beasts of the wild, tribes of the sea.

In netted toils he takes.

The Subtle One.

Sophocles, Antigone (440 B.C.; translated by F. L. Lucas)

Benjamin Franklin (1706–90) used to define man as 'a tool-making animal'. In fact a good many other animals make and use rather primitive tools, and of course they quite often make better houses than do many uncivilized men. It might not be very easy to point out the exact moment in the development of man at which his technology could be said noticeably to surpass that of the beasts that perish. Perhaps it was later than we think, especially if the early men were arboreal.

However this may be, the gap both in time and in technical achievement between the sticks and stones of the earliest men – which were not much better than the tools used by the higher animals – and the sophisticated and beautiful artefacts of the late Stone Age is an immense one. Pre-metallic cultures have survived in remote places until only yesterday and many of their devices can be seen and admired in museums. To make strong structures without the benefit of metals requires an instinct for the distribution and direction of stresses which is by no means always possessed by modern engineers; for the use of metals, which are so conveniently tough and uniform, has taken some of the intuition and also some of the thinking out of engineering. Since the invention of Fibreglass and other artificial composite materials we have been returning at times to the sort of fibrous non-metallic structures which were developed by the Polynesians and the Eskimoes. As a result we have become more aware of our own inadequacies in visualizing stress systems and, just possibly, more respectful of primitive technologies.

As a matter of fact the introduction of the technological metals to the civilized world – probably between 2,000 and 1,000 B.C. – did not make a very large or immediate difference to most artificial structures, because metals were scarce, expensive and not very easy to shape. The use of metals for cutting tools and weapons and, to some extent, for armour had its effect, but the majority of load-bearing artefacts continued to be made from masonry and from timber and leather and rope and textiles.

Using the old mixed constructions, the millwright and the coachbuilder, the shipwright and the rigger, needed a very high degree of skill, though of course they had their blind spots and they made the sort of mistakes one might expect from men without a formal analytical training. On the whole, the introduction of steam and machinery resulted in a dilution of skills, and it also limited the range of materials in general use in 'advanced technology' to a few standardized, rigid substances such as steel and concrete.

The pressures in some of the early engines were not much higher than our blood-pressure but, since materials like leather are incapable of withstanding hot steam, the engineer could not contrive a steam engine out of bladders and membranes and flexible tubes. So he was compelled to evolve from metals, by mechanical means, movements which an animal might have achieved more simply and perhaps with less weight.* He had to get his effects by means of wheels, springs, connecting rods and pistons sliding in cylinders.

Although these rather clumsy devices were originally imposed on him by the limitations of his materials, the engineer has come to look on this kind of approach to technology as the only proper and respectable one. Once he has settled in his rut of metal cogwheels and girders the engineer takes a lot of shifting. Moreover this attitude to materials and technology has rubbed off on the general public. Not long ago, at a cocktail party, the pretty wife of an American scientist said to me 'So you're really telling me that people used to make airplanes out of wood! – out of lumber \ I don't believe you, you're kidding me.'

To what extent this outlook is objectively justified and how far it is based on prejudice and a morbid passion for being up to date is one of the questions which we shall discuss in this book. We need to take a balanced view. The traditional range of engineering structures made from bricks and stone and concrete and from steel and aluminium have been very successful, and clearly we ought to take them seriously, both for their own sakes and for what they have to teach us in a broader context. We might remember, however, that the pneumatic tyre, for instance, has changed the face of land transport and is probably a more important invention than the internal combustion engine. Yet we do not often teach engineering students about tyres, and there has been a distinct tendency in the schools of engineering to sweep the whole business of flexible structures under the carpet. When we come to look at the question in a broad way we may perhaps find that, for solid quantitative reasons, there is a case for trying to rebuild some part of traditional engineering upon models which may well turn out to be partly biological in inspiration.

Whatever view we may take of these matters we cannot get away from the fact that every branch of technology must be concerned, to a greater or less extent, with questions of strength and deflections; and we may consider ourselves lucky if our mistakes in these directions are merely annoying or expensive and do not kill or injure somebody. Those concerned with electrical affairs might be reminded that a great proportion of the failures in electrical and electronic devices are mechanical in origin.

Structures can, and do, break, and this may be important and sometimes dramatic; but, in conventional technology, the rigidity and deflections of a structure before it breaks are likely to be more important in practice. A house, a floor or a table which wobbled or swayed would not be acceptable, and we should consider that the performance of, say, an optical device such as a microscope or a camera depends not only upon the quality of its lenses but also upon the accuracy and rigidity with which they are positioned. Faults of this kind are far too common.

工艺结构

世上奇迹虽多，若论神奇

难比于人 ——

他迎着凛冬寒风，

穿过滔天巨浪，

横渡沧溟茫茫；

连不倦不朽之大地，这最古老的神灵，

亦厌倦他，年复一年，

来来去去，耕耘不辍。

逍遥自在者，飞鸟，

走兽，游鱼，

尽入其网，

败于他的狡黠。

—— 索福克勒斯（Sophocles），《安提戈涅》（Antigone）

本杰明·富兰克林曾把人定义为「一种会制造工具的动物」。事实上，好多其他动物也会制造并使用相当原始的工具，它们筑巢的本事甚至常常超过未开化的人。要指明人类走出洪荒的确切时刻绝非易事，彼时人类的技艺可以说完胜那些沦为食物的野兽。考虑到早期人类可能栖息于树上这个事实，或许，它比我们想象的要晚。

然而，人类从最早期的棍棒和石块（并不比高等动物使用的工具好多少）到石器时代晚期成熟精美的手工制品，跨越了一条巨大的鸿沟。金属工具时代之前的文明在化外之地存续已久，许多器物就陈列在博物馆里。不借助金属材料就制作出坚固的结构，需要一种把握应力分布和方向的天赋，这是现代工程师未必具备的；金属自有坚韧且均质之便，就其运用而言，既有直觉上的考量，也有工程之外的思索。自玻璃纤维等人工复合材料问世以来，我们间或回归波利尼西亚人和因纽特人开发出的那种含纤维的非金属结构。故而，我们越发意识到自身在运用应力体系方面的不足，也因此更加敬重原始工艺。

事实上，金属工艺进入人类文明 —— 大致在公元前 2000 年到公元前 1000 年间 —— 对大部分人工结构来说，并没有带来特别巨大或直接的不同，原因在于金属既稀缺又昂贵，且不易成形。在切削工具、武器以及甲胄上局部使用金属自有其效果，但大多数承担负载的人工制品仍是由砖石、木材、皮革、绳索和纺织物构成的。

2『金属工艺进入人类文明的时间节点，做一张信息数据卡片。（2021-06-19）』—— 已完成

建磨坊的、造车的、造船的以及搞装配的工匠在使用这些旧式的混合构造时，需要具备高超的技能，但他们有各自的弱势，也会因缺乏正规理论训练而犯错。总而言之，蒸汽与机械的引入导致了手工技能的弱化，也使应用于「先进工艺」的材料范围局限于少数标准化的刚性材质，譬如钢材和混凝土。

虽然某些早期发动机的缸压并不比我们的血压高多少，但像皮革这样的材料无法承受灼热的蒸汽，工程师没法用皮囊、皮膜和软管制作出一台蒸汽发动机。因此，他们只能用金属，并借助机械手段实现。要是让动物来做同样的事，它们的办法可能更简单，耗材或许更轻。[1] 而工程师则不得不依靠轮子、弹簧、连杆和气缸中滑动的活塞来达成目标。

虽然这些笨重的装置最初是受材料所限而不得已用之，但工程师已逐渐把这种技术视作正当且体面的方法。在习惯使用金属齿轮和主梁后，工程师玩出了新花样。此外，这种对材料和技术的态度已经散播到普通人中间去了。不久前，在一场鸡尾酒会上，一位美国科学家的美丽妻子对我说：「你是说人们过去是用木材造飞机的吗？就用破木头！我不信，你就胡扯吧。」

我们应如何客观评价这些结构，它们又在多大程度上是基于偏见和赶时髦的心血来潮，这是本书探讨的问题之一。我们需要保持一种均衡的观点。工程结构的传统选材范围遍及砖石混凝土、钢材和铝材，已经非常成功，我们显然不可等闲视之，既因为这些材料本身的作用，也因为我们从中获益良多。然而，我们或许记得，充气轮胎改变了陆上运输的面貌，这可能是比内燃机更重要的发明。但我们一般不怎么给工科生讲授轮胎的相关知识，工科学校有一个明显的倾向，即对柔性结构一概讳莫如深。当我们更宽泛地看待这个问题时，或许可以发现，出于定量的考虑，我们可以试着重构传统工程学的某些部分，将其建立在仿生学模型的基础上。

无论我们持何种观点，都无法回避这样的事实：工程技术的每个分支都必须或多或少地关注强度和挠度的问题。而且，如果我们在这些问题上犯错带来的仅仅是恼人的烦琐程序或高昂的花费，而非人员伤亡的后果，我们已经相当走运了。那些从事与电子相关工作的人可能会被提醒，大部分电气与电子设备的故障都是由机械故障引发的。

结构能够被破坏，也确实会遭到破坏，这可能很重要，有时也颇富戏剧性；但是，在传统的工程技术中，一个结构在破坏前的刚度和挠度在实践过程中可能更为重要。摇摇晃晃的房子、地板和桌子难遂人意，我们应该意识到光学设备，比如显微镜或照相机，其性能不仅取决于镜头的品质，还依赖于其架设位置的精度和刚度。而这类失误比比皆是。

### 1.3 Structures and aesthetics

Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,

I would speak my heart out: heaven is my need.

Every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood,

Flashing like the whitebeam, swaying like the reed.

Flushing like the dogwood crimson in October;

Streaming like the flag-reed South-West blown;

Flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted whitebeam:

All seem to know what is for heaven alone.

George Meredith, Love in the Valley

Nowadays, whether we like it or not, we are stuck with one form or another of advanced technology and we have got to make it work safely and efficiently: this involves, among other things, the intelligent application of structural theory. However, man does not live by safety and efficiency alone, and we have to face the fact that, visually, the world is becoming an increasingly depressing place. It is not, perhaps, so much the occurrence of what might be described as 'active ugliness' as the prevalence of the dull and the commonplace. Far too seldom is the heart rejoiced or does one feel any better or happier for looking at the works of modern man.

Yet most of the artefacts of the eighteenth century, even quite humble and trivial ones, seem to many of us to be at least pleasing and sometimes incomparably beautiful. To that extent people – all people – in the eighteenth century lived richer lives than most of us do today. This is reflected in the prices we pay nowadays for period houses and antiques. A society which was more creative and self-confident would not feel quite so strong a nostalgia for its great-grandfathers' buildings and household goods.

Although such a book as this is not the place in which to develop elaborate and perhaps controversial theories of applied art, the question cannot be wholly ignored. As we have said, nearly every artefact is in some sense a structure of one kind or another, and, although most artefacts are not primarily concerned with making an emotional or aesthetic effect, it is highly important to realize that there can be no such thing as an emotionally neutral statement. This is true whether the medium be speech or writing or painting or technological design. Whether we mean it or not, every single thing we design and make will have some kind of subjective impact, for good or bad, over and above its overt rational purpose.

I think we are up against yet another problem of communication. Most engineers have had no aesthetic training at all, and the tendency in the schools of engineering is to despise such matters as frivolous. In any case, there is little enough time in the crowded syllabuses. Modern architects have made it very clear to me that they cannot spare time from their lordly sociological objectives to consider such minor matters as the strength of their buildings; nor, indeed, can they spare much time for aesthetics, in which their clients are probably not much interested anyway. Again, furniture designers, incredibly, are not taught during their formal training how to calculate the deflection in an ordinary bookshelf when it is loaded with books, and so it is not very surprising that most of them seem to have no ideas about relating the appearance to the structure of their products.

结构与审美

如今，我们往往一边受制于某种先进工艺，一边还得保证其安全有效：这就需要我们高明地应用结构理论。然而，人并非仅仅依赖安全和效率为生，我们还得面对这样一个事实：这世界看似变得越发令人沮丧了。这与其说是「自找的丑」，不如说是平庸乏味的盛行。现代人的作品罕有令人赏心悦目者。

然而，大部分 18 世纪的人工制品，哪怕是那些相当不起眼的，在我们很多人看来，至少是令人愉悦的，有的甚至堪称精美绝伦。就此而论，那些活在 18 世纪的人 —— 所有人 —— 过得比我们今天的大部分人都要丰富多彩。我们如今在老宅和古董上的花销就反映了这一点。一个更具创造力和自信心的社会不会对太爷爷辈的屋子和家当抱有那么强烈的怀旧之情。

虽然本书并不打算阐述繁复甚至有争议的实用艺术理论，但这个问题却不能置之不理。正如我们已经提到的，几乎每一件人工制品在一定意义上都包含这种或那种结构，尽管大部分人工制品并非为了满足情感的需要或达到审美的效果，但我们务必意识到，世上没有无情的表达。演说、写作、绘画，或者工业设计概莫能外。不管有心还是无意，我们设计制造的每一件东西都带有某些个人色彩，无论好坏，都超越了表面上的理性初衷。

我认为我们还面临着另一个问题 —— 沟通。大部分工程师完全没有接受过审美训练，工科学校倾向于鄙夷这类浮华之事。此外，满满当当的教学大纲中已挤不出空间给审美。现代建筑师已经说得非常清楚，他们不会从自己高雅的社会性任务中挤出时间来考虑建筑强度之类的琐事；实际上，他们也不会把太多时间花在审美上，况且他们的客户大概也不怎么感兴趣。同样令人难以置信的是，家具设计师在接受的正规训练中也没有学习过如何计算书放在普通书架上产生的挠度，所以大多数设计师似乎完全不懂如何把产品外观同其结构联系起来，也就没什么可奇怪的了。

### 1.4 The theory of elasticity, or why things do fall down

Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?

Luke 13.4

Many people – especially English people – dislike theory, and usually they do not think very much of theoreticians. This seems to apply especially to questions of strength and elasticity. A really surprising number of people who would not venture into the fields of, say, chemistry or medicine feel themselves competent to produce a structure upon which someone's life may depend. If pressed, they might admit that a large bridge or an aeroplane was a little beyond them, but the common structures of life surely present only the most trivial of problems?

This is not to suggest that the construction of an ordinary shed is a matter calling for years of study; yet it is true that the whole subject is littered with traps for the unwary, and many things are not as simple as they might seem. Too often the engineers are only called in, professionally, to deal with the structural achievements of 'practical' men at the same time as the lawyers and the undertakers.

Nevertheless, for long centuries the practical men managed after their own fashion – at least in certain fields of construction. If you go and look at a cathedral you may well wonder whether you are impressed more deeply by the skill or by the faith of the people who built it. These buildings are not only of very great size and height; some of them seem to transcend the dull and heavy nature of their constructional materials and to soar upwards into art and poetry.

On the face of it it would seem obvious that the medieval masons knew a great deal about how to build churches and cathedrals, and of course they were often highly successful and superbly good at it. However, if you had had the chance to ask the Master Mason how it was really done and why the thing stood up at all, I think he might have said something like 'The building is kept up by the hand of God – always provided that, when we built it, we duly followed the traditional rules and mysteries of our craft.'

Naturally, the buildings we see and admire are those which have survived: in spite of their 'mysteries' and their skill and experience, the medieval masons were by no means always successful. A fair proportion of their more ambitious efforts fell down soon after they were built, or sometimes during construction. However, these catastrophes were just as likely to be regarded as sent from Heaven, to punish the unrighteous or to bring sinners to repentance, as to be the consequence of mere technical ignorance – hence the need for the remark about the tower of Siloam.*

Perhaps because they were too much obsessed by the moral significance of good workmanship, the old builders and carpenters and shipwrights never seem to nave thought at all, in any scientific sense, about why a structure is able to carry a load. Professor Jacques Heyman has shown conclusively that the cathedral masons, at any rate, did not think or design in the modern way. Although some of the achievements of the medieval craftsmen are impressive, the intellectual basis of their 'rules' and 'mysteries' was not very different from that of a cookery book. What these people did was to make something very much like what had been made before.

As we shall see in Chapter 9, masonry is a rather exceptional case and there are some special reasons why it is sometimes safe and practicable to scale up from small churches to large cathedrals, relying simply on experience and traditional proportions. For other kinds of structures this way of doing things will not work and is quite unsafe. This is the reason why, though buildings got bigger and bigger, for a very long time the size of the largest ships remained virtually constant. So long as there was no scientific way of predicting the safety of technological structures, attempts to make devices which were new or radically different were only too likely to end in disaster.

Thus, for generation after generation, men turned their heads away from a rational approach to problems of strength. However, if you make a habit of shelving questions which, in your secret heart, you must surely know to be important, the psychological consequences will be unhappy. What happened was just what one would have expected. The whole subject became a breeding-ground for cruelty and superstition. When a ship is christened by some noble matron with a bottle of champagne, or when a foundation stone is laid by a fat mayor, these ceremonies are the last vestiges of certain very nasty sacrificial rites.

During the course of the Middle Ages the Church managed to suppress most of the sacrifices, but it did not do much to encourage any kind of scientific approach. To escape completely from such attitudes – or to accept that God may work through the agency of the laws of science – requires a complete change of thinking, a mental effort such as we can scarcely comprehend today. It called for a quite exceptional combination of imagination with intellectual discipline at a time when the very vocabulary of science barely existed.

As it turned out, the old craftsmen never accepted the challenge, and it is interesting to reflect that the effective beginnings of the serious study of structures may be said to be due to the persecution and obscurantism of the Inquisition. In 1633, Galileo (1564–1642) fell foul of the Church on account of his revolutionary astronomical discoveries, which were considered to threaten the very bases of religious and civil authority. He was most firmly headed off astronomy and, after his famous recantation,* he was perhaps lucky to be allowed to retire to his villa at Arcetri, near Florence. Living there, virtually under house-arrest, he took up the study of the strength of materials as being, I suppose, the safest and least subversive subject he could think of.

As it happened, Galileo's own contribution to our knowledge of the strength of materials was only moderately distinguished, though one must bear in mind that he was almost seventy when he began to work on the subject, that he had been through a great deal and that he was still more or less a prisoner. However, he was allowed to correspond with scholars in various parts of Europe, and his great reputation lent prestige and publicity to any subject he took up.

Among his many surviving letters there are several about structures, and his correspondence with Mersenne, who worked in France, seems to have been particularly fruitful. Marin Mersenne (1588–1648) was a Jesuit priest, but presumably nobody could object to his researches on the strength of metal wires. Edmé Mariotte (1620–84), a much younger man, was also a priest, being Prior of Saint Martin-sous-Beaune, near Dijon, in the wine country. He spent most of his life working on the laws of terrestrial mechanics and on the strength of rods in tension and in bending. Under Louis XIV he helped to found the French Academy of Sciences and was in favour with both Church and State. None of these people, it will be noted, were professional builders or shipwrights.

By Mariotte's time the whole subject of the behaviour of materials and structures under loads was beginning to be called the science of elasticity – for reasons which will become apparent in the next chapter – and we shall use this name repeatedly throughout this book. Since the subject became popular with mathematicians about 150 years ago I am afraid that a really formidable number of unreadable, incomprehensible books have been written about elasticity, and generations of students have endured agonies of boredom in lectures about materials and structures. In my opinion the mystique and mumbo-jumbo is overdone and often beside the point. It is true that the higher flights of elasticity are mathematical and very difficult – but then this sort of theory is probably only rarely used by successful engineering designers. What is actually needed for a great many ordinary purposes can be understood quite easily by any intelligent person who will give his or her mind to the matter.

The man in the street, or the man in the workshop, thinks he needs virtually no theoretical knowledge. The engineering don is apt to pretend that to get anywhere worth while without the higher mathematics is not only impossible but that it would be vaguely immoral if you could. It seems to me that ordinary mortals like you and me can get along surprisingly well with some intermediate – and I hope more interesting – state of knowledge.

All the same, we cannot wholly evade the question of mathematics, which is said to have originated in Babylonia – possibly at the time of the Tower of Babel incident. Mathematics is to the scientist and the engineer a tool, to the professional mathematician a religion, but to the ordinary person a stumbling-block. Yet all of us are really using mathematics through every moment of our lives. When we play tennis or walk downstairs we are actually solving whole pages of differential equations, quickly, easily and without thinking about it, using the analogue computer which we keep in our minds. What we find difficult about mathematics is the formal, symbolic presentation of the subject by pedagogues with a taste for dogma, sadism and incomprehensible squiggles.

For the most part, wherever a 'mathematical' argument is really needed I shall try to use graphs and diagrams of the simplest kind. We shall, however, need some arithmetic and a little very, very elementary algebra, which – however rude we may be to the mathematicians – is, after all, a simple, powerful and convenient mode of thought. Even if you are born, or think you are born, with an allergy to algebra, please do not be frightened of it. However, if you really must skip it, it will still be possible to follow the arguments in this book in a qualitative way without losing too much of the story.

One further point: structures are made from materials and we shall talk about structures and also about materials; but in fact there is no clear-cut dividing line between a material and a structure. Steel is undoubtedly a material and the Forth bridge is undoubtedly a structure, but reinforced concrete and wood and human flesh – all of which have a rather complicated constitution – may be considered as either materials or structures. I am afraid that, like Humpty-Dumpty, when we use the word 'material' in this book, it will mean whatever we want it to mean. That this is not always the same as what other people mean by 'material' was brought home to me by another lady at another cocktail party.

'Do tell me what it is you do?'

'I'm a professor of materials.'

'What fun it must be to handle all those dress-fabrics!'

1 Compare pistons and bellows.

2 There is an interesting discussion of pagan views on this subject in Gilbert Murray's Five Stages of Greek Religion (O.U.P., 1930). Again, the whole question of animism in connection with structures is worthy of study.

高楼为什么会倒塌

西罗亚楼倒塌了，死了十八个人，你们以为他们的罪孽深过住在耶路撒冷的所有人吗？

——《圣经·新约全书·路加福音》（Luke 13:4）

许多人 —— 尤其是英格兰人 —— 厌恶理论，他们一般不怎么看得起理论家。这似乎特别适用于强度和弹性问题。相当一部分人不敢涉足化学或医学领域，却自认为有能力制造出一个关乎人命的结构。如果施加一些压力，他们可能会承认造一座大桥或一架飞机有点儿超出他们的能力范围，然而，那些关乎人命的普通结构真的就谁都能造出来吗？

这不是说搭一座寻常的棚子也是一件需经年累月研究的要事；然而，整个学科确实遍布着稍不留神就会掉入的陷阱，许多事情也不像看上去那么简单。在绝大多数情况下，工程师只是同律师和送葬者一道出现，专门应付属于「实干家」的结构事务。

然而，数个世纪以来，实干家都在按自己的套路行事，至少在某些制造领域是这样。如果你游览一座主教座堂（cathedral），就难免会问：建造者的技巧或信念，哪一个给你的印象更深？这些建筑不仅仅在体量上堪称宏伟，某些似乎还超越了其构造材质的沉闷笨重，升华到了艺术与诗性的境界。

从表面上看，中世纪的石匠显然对如何建造教堂和主教座堂了如指掌，当然他们往往成就斐然且精于此道。然而，如果你有机会向一位石匠大师讨教此中的细节和原理，我想他可能会这么说：「建筑的屹立有赖于无处不在的上帝之手，当我们建造它时，我们恪守传统的规矩与我们技艺的奥秘。」

然而，我们看见和欣赏的是那些存世的建筑：虽然身负「奥秘」、技巧和经验，但中世纪的石匠也不总是成功的。在他们更具野心的尝试中，很大一部分在建成后不久便坍塌了，有的甚至在施工期间便倒下了。但是，这些灾难多半被视为天谴，是为了惩罚罪恶，而不是纯粹由技术上的无知造成的后果。因此，我们有必要谈谈西罗亚楼。[2]

或许，因为太沉迷于好手艺的道德意义，旧时代的建筑师、木匠和造船工似乎未曾从科学角度思考过一个结构为何能够承载一定的负荷。雅克·海曼（Jacques Heyman）教授曾明确指出，造主教座堂的石匠，无论如何也不会以现代的方式思考或设计。虽然中世纪工匠的一些成就令人印象深刻，但他们那些「规矩」和「奥秘」的智力水准可能和一本烹饪手册没多大区别。这些人所做的事情基本上就是沿袭以前的工作。

我们将在第 9 章看到，砖石构造是一种特例，仅依靠经验和传统比例将小教堂扩建为大型主教座堂有时之所以安全可行，是有其特殊原因的。而对其他类型的结构而言，这么做则行不通，甚至相当危险。这就是为何虽然建筑物越来越大，但在相当长时间里大型船舶的尺寸几乎保持不变。没有科学的方法来预测工程结构的安全性，尝试制造全新或截然不同的装置只能以灾难告终。

1-2『这里的主题是「工程放大」，中世纪的建筑是「砖石结构」，而砖石结构是一种「特例」，中世纪的砖石建筑之所以被放大建造而不塌，靠的是砖石结构的特殊性，运气使然。砖石结构的特殊性，直觉上很重要，先做一张主题卡片，等研读第九章的时候再补充信息。（2021-06-19）』

因此，一代又一代人逐渐不再用理性的思维解决强度的难题。然而，如果你总是在内心深处搁置自认为很重要的问题，那么你在心理上一定不舒服，你害怕的事往往会发生。这个难题变成了滋生残忍和迷信的温床。当某位达官贵人为新船下水开香槟酒，或者一位大腹便便的市镇长官为建筑开工奠基时，这些仪式典礼正是某些残忍献祭的最后残余。

中世纪，天主教会查禁了大多数献祭仪式，但这对鼓励科学方法的使用并没有多大帮助。为了完全摆脱此类做法，或者为了承认上帝可以借助科学规律的力量来行事，需要一次彻底的思想转变，一种我们今天难以体会的精神蜕变。当科学术语几乎不存在时，就需要将想象力与知识素养别出心裁地结合在一起。

结果表明，旧时代的工匠从未在这方面做出过努力。有趣的是，关于结构的严肃研究的真正开端，可追溯至宗教裁判所的迫害和愚民政策。1633 年，伽利略（1564-1642）因其革命性的天文发现而触怒天主教会，他的工作被认为威胁了宗教神权和世俗政权的基础。教会严禁他涉足天文学研究，在众所周知的改邪归正之后，[3] 他幸运地获准退隐于佛罗伦萨附近的阿切特里。名义上蛰居家中，实质上被软禁的他开始研究材料强度，我猜想这是他可以想到的最安全且颠覆性最小的课题了。

就有关材料强度的知识而言，伽利略的贡献仅算略有创新，但你务必牢记他开始研究该课题时已年近七旬，饱经风霜且形同囚徒。然而，他获准同欧洲各地的学者通信，而他的显赫声名为其从事的所有研究都赋予了权威性和知名度。

1『意外收获，原来又是伽利略最新用「科学」的视角研究材料，牛人就是牛人。（2021-06-19）』

在他存世的许多信件中，有几封是关于结构的，其中他与法国的马林·梅森（Marin Mersenne）的通信似乎尤为成果显著。马林·梅森是一位耶稣会神父，但想必无人会否认他在金属丝强度方面的研究。埃德梅·马略特（Edmé Mariotte）更年轻，也是一位神父，是第戎附近的葡萄酒之乡圣马丁苏博讷的修道院院长。他用了大半辈子的时间来研究地质力学的规律，以及杆在拉伸和弯曲状态下的强度。在路易十四治下，他促成了法兰西科学院的创立，博得了天主教会和世俗政权的欢心。值得注意的是，这些人里没有一个是专职的建筑或造船工匠。

到了马略特的时代，研究材料和结构负载行为这门学问开始被称为弹性科学（原因将在下一章中揭示），我会在本书中反复使用这个名词。大概自 150 年前这门学科得到数学家的重视后，有关弹性的枯燥晦涩的著作犹如汗牛充栋，一代代学生在有关材料和结构的讲授中深受无聊的摧残。以我之见，故作高深与故弄玄虚实无必要，而且往往离题万里。固然，有关弹性的深层次研究一定与数学有关，也非常艰深，但这类理论可能只是偶尔被成功的工程设计人员采用。许多寻常用途实际所需的学问，很容易被任何有心的聪明人理解。

街上的路人或车间里的工人认为他们几乎不需要理论知识。工科教员倾向于宣称，想要有所收获，不借助高等数学是办不到的，即使办得到，也不过是旁门左道。在我看来，像你我这样的凡夫俗子跟某些介于中间的 —— 我希望是更有趣的 —— 知识异常投缘。

尽管如此，我们也不能完全回避数学问题，据说它起源于古巴比伦，也许就是建造巴别塔的时代。对科学家和工程师而言，数学是一种工具；对数学家而言，数学是一门宗教；但对普罗大众来说，数学则是一块绊脚石。事实上，所有人在生活中的每时每刻都离不开数学。当我们打网球或下楼时，我们实际上在解整页的微分方程，我们的计算迅速、从容且不假思索，借助的是大脑里的模拟计算机。由于偏爱教条、施虐和鬼画桃符的好为人师者对这门学科形式化、符号化的表述，数学变得艰深晦涩。

在大部分情况下，在任何真正需要用数学方法论证的地方，我都会尽量使用最简单的示意图表。但是，我们应该也会用到一些算术和一点儿初等的代数，这毕竟是一种简单、强大且方便的思维模式，这样说可能对数学家有些无礼。纵然你以为自己天生搞不懂代数问题，也请不要畏惧它。可是，若你执意略过它，你仍可以从本质上读懂本书，而不至于错过太多细节。

还有一点要注意：结构是由材料构成的，我们既会谈结构，也会聊材料；但事实上，材料和结构之间并没有明确的分界线。钢无疑是一种材料，福斯铁路桥无疑是一个结构，但钢筋混凝土、木材和人类肌体 —— 所有这些东西都具有相当复杂的构成 —— 既可被视为材料，也可被看作结构。就像蛋头先生（Humpty-Dumpty）[4] 那样，本书中使用的「材料」一词，指代了我们想用它指代的任何东西。它与其他人所谓的「材料」并不总是同义，这一点还是某次鸡尾酒会上一位女士给了我启发。

The difficult birth of the science of elasticity

第一部分

弹性科学的前世今生

## 0201. Why structures carry loads

or the springiness of solids

Let us begin at the beginning with Newton who said that action and reaction are equal and opposite. This means that every push must be matched and balanced by an equal and opposite push. It does not matter how the push arises. It may be a 'dead' load for instance: that is to say a stationary weight of some kind. If I weigh 200 pounds and stand on the floor, then the soles of my feet push downwards on the floor with a push or thrust of 200 pounds; that is the business of feet. At the same time the floor must push upwards on my feet with a thrust of 200 pounds; that is the business of floors. If the floor is rotten and cannot furnish a thrust of 200 pounds then I shall fall through the floor. If however, by some miracle, the floor produced a larger thrust than my feet have called upon it to produce, say 201 pounds, then the result would be still more surprising because, of course, I should become airborne.

The New Science of Strong Materials – or Why you don't fall through the floor (Chapter 2)

We might start by asking how it is that any inanimate solid, such as steel or stone or timber or plastic, is able to resist a mechanical force at all – or even to sustain its own weight? This is, essentially, the problem of 'Why we don't fall through the floor' and the answer is by no means obvious. It lies at the root of the whole study of structures and is intellectually difficult. In the event, it proved too difficult for Galileo, and the credit for the achievement of any real understanding of the problem is due to that very cantankerous man Robert Hooke (1635–1702).

In the first place, Hooke realized that, if a material or a structure is to resist a load, it can only do so by pushing back at it with an equal and opposite force. If your feet push down on the floor, the floor must push up on your feet. If a cathedral pushes down on its foundations, the foundations must push up on the cathedral. This is implicit in Newton's third law of motion, which, it will be remembered, is about action and reaction being equal and opposite.

In other words, a force cannot just get lost. Always and whatever happens every force must be balanced and reacted by another equal and opposite force at every point throughout a structure. This is true for any kind of structure, however small and simple or however large and complicated it may be. It is true, not only for floors and cathedrals, but also for bridges and aeroplanes and balloons and furniture and lions and tigers and cabbages and earthworms.

If this condition is not fulfilled, that is to say if all the forces are not in equilibrium or balance with each other, then either the structure will break or else the whole affair must take off, like a rocket, and end up somewhere in outer space. This latter result is frequently implicit in the examination answers of engineering students.

Let us consider for a moment the simplest possible sort of structure. Suppose that we hang a weight, such as an ordinary brick, from some support – which might be the branch of a tree -by means of a piece of string (Figure 1). The weight of the brick, like the weight of Newton's apple, is due to the effect of the earth's gravitational field upon its mass and it acts continually downwards. If the brick is not to fall, then it must be sustained in its position in mid-air by a continuing equal and opposite upwards force or pull in the string. If the string is too weak, so that it cannot produce an upward force equal to the weight of the brick, then the string will break and the brick will fall to the ground -again like Newton's apple.

Figure 1. The weight of the brick, acting downwards, must be supported by an equal and opposite upward pull or tension in the string.

However, if our string is a strong one, so that we are able to hang not one, but two, bricks from it, then the string will now have to produce twice as much upward force; that is, enough to support both bricks. And so on, of course, for any other variations of the load. Moreover, the load does not have to be a 'dead' weight such as a brick; forces arising from any other cause, such as the pressure of the wind, must be resisted by the same sort of reaction.

In the case of the brick which hangs from a tree the load is supported by the tension in the string, in other words by a pull. In many structures, such as buildings, the load is carried in compression, that is by pushing. In both cases the general principles are the same. Thus if any structural system is to do its job – that is to say, if the load is supported in a satisfactory way so that nothing very much happens – then it must somehow manage to produce a push or a pull which is exactly equal and opposite to the force which is being applied to it. That is, it has to resist all the pushes and pulls which may happen to arrive upon its doorstep by pushing and pulling back at them by just the right amount.

This is all very well and it is generally fairly easy to see why a load pushes or pulls on a structure. The difficulty is to see why the structure should push or pull back at the load. As it happens, quite young children have had some inkling of the problem from time to time.

'Do stop pulling the cat's tail, darling. '

'I'm not pulling, Mummy, Pussy's pulling.'

In the case of the cat's tail the reaction is provided by the living biological activity of the cat's muscles pulling against the child's muscles, but of course this kind of active muscular reaction is not very often available, nor is it necessary.

If the cat's tail had happened to be attached, not to the cat, but to something inert, like a wall, then the wall would have to be doing the 'pulling'; whether the resistance to the child's pull is generated actively by the cat or passively by the wall makes no difference to the child or to the tail (Figures 2 and 3).

How then can an inert or passive thing like a wall or a string -or, come to that, a bone or a steel girder or a cathedral – produce the large reactive forces which are needed?

Figure 2. 'Do stop pulling the cat's tail, darling.'

'I'm not pulling, Mummy, Pussy's pulling.'

Figure 3. It doesn't make any difference whether Pussy pulls or not.

结构的根基 —— 胡克定律与固体的弹性

让我们从牛顿开始，他曾说作用力和反作用力大小相等且方向相反。这意味着每个推力必定有一个等大且反向的推力来匹配和平衡，这与推力如何产生无关。例如，它或许是一种「死」载荷，即某种不变的配重。若体重 200 磅 [1] 的我站在地板上，那么我脚底向下推地板将形成 200 磅力 [2] 的作用，这是脚施加的；同时，地板一定向上推我的脚形成 200 磅力的支撑，这是地板施加的。如果地板腐朽了，不能提供 200 磅力的支撑，我就会穿过地板掉下去。但若凭借某种奇迹，地板产生了比我的脚施加的力更大的支撑，比如 201 磅力，结果就会更加令人惊讶，因为我肯定会蹿上半空。

——《强材料新科学研究》

我们可以先想想，任何无生命的固体，比如钢材、石头、木材或塑料，如何完全对抗机械性力量，从而支撑起自身重量？本质上，这就是「为何你不会穿透地板掉下去」的问题，而答案则不那么简单。这个问题是整个结构研究的根基，非常考验智力。到头来，它把伽利略难倒了，而真正解开该难题的是个坏脾气的家伙 —— 罗伯特·胡克（Robert Hooke）。

1-3『胡克脾气不好，之前就听说过，印象中他对哪个「新星」有偏见，好像是瓦特，待验证。补充：后面第二小节的信息给出了答案，原来是牛顿，就说有印象，胡克跟谁不对付，哈哈。（2021-06-19）』

起初，胡克意识到，若材料或结构要对抗载荷，就只能靠等大反向的反作用力来实现。如果你的脚向下踩压地板，地板也一定会向上推你的脚。如果一座主教座堂向下推地基，地基也一定会向上推主教座堂。流传于世的牛顿第三运动定律解释了其中的道理，即作用力与反作用力大小相等且方向相反。

换言之，一个力是不会凭空消失的。无论何种情况，在结构的各个点上，每个力都必须有等大反向的另一个力来平衡且起到反作用。对任何一种结构皆如此，不管它多么微小简单或多么巨大复杂：不仅是地板和主教座堂，还有桥梁、飞机、气球、家具、狮子、老虎、卷心菜、蚯蚓等。

如果这个条件不能满足，即所有力不平衡或不能彼此抵消，结构就会被破坏，或者整体起飞，像火箭一样最终进入外层空间。后一种结果经常隐含在工科生的考试答案中。

让我们考虑一个可能的最简单的结构。假设我们悬挂一个重物，比如用一根绳子将一块普通的砖头系在一个树枝上（见图 2–1）。砖块的重量像牛顿实验中的苹果一样，由于地球引力场对该物体质量的作用，其方向总是竖直向下。如果砖块不掉下来，就表示它受到的等大反向的力或绳子拉力可以维持它在半空中的位置。如果绳子不够结实，以至于不能产生一个同砖块重量等大的向上的力，绳子就会断裂，而砖块会掉到地上，就像牛顿的苹果一样。

然而，若这根绳子很强韧，我们甚至可以用它悬挂两块砖头，绳子现在承受的向上的力就是原来的两倍，即它足以支撑两块砖的重量。以此类推，载荷的其他改变亦如此。此外，载荷未必是像一块砖头那样的「死」配重；任何其他原因产生的力，比如风的压力，一定也有同样的反作用力。

图 2–1 砖块的重量竖直向下，必须由等大且朝上的绳子拉力或张力来支撑

在树枝悬挂砖块的情境中，支持载荷的是绳子的张力，即拉力。在许多结构中，比如建筑物，载荷源于压缩，即通过挤压产生。在上述两种情境中，基本原理都是一样的。因此，若任意结构体系要发挥其作用（载荷以令人满意的方式获得支撑且没有意外发生），那么它一定以某种方式产生推力或拉力，与施加其上的外力完全等大且反向。也就是说，它需要承载所有推力和拉力，而这些推力和拉力正好与其反作用力平衡。

如果一切顺利，我们通常很容易看出载荷为何对结构施加推或拉的作用力。困难之处则在于，弄清楚为什么结构对载荷施加推或拉的反作用力。巧的是，小孩子间或察觉到这个难题的些许线索。

「别再拉猫尾巴啦，宝贝。」

「我没拉，妈妈，是猫在拉我。」

在猫尾巴的情境中，反作用力是由猫的肌肉对小孩子的肌肉进行反拉产生的。当然，这类主动的肌肉反应并不常见，也没有必要。如果猫尾巴碰巧不在猫身上，而是系在某些像墙一样的惰性物体上，这堵墙就不得不进行「拉」的动作；无论对小孩拉动的对抗是猫的主动行为，还是墙的被动行为，对小孩或尾巴来说都没有区别（见图 2–2 和图 2–3）。

图 2–2「别再拉猫尾巴啦，宝贝。」「我没拉，妈妈，是猫在拉我。」

图 2–3 不管是不是猫在拉，都没有任何区别

那么，像墙、绳子、骨骼、钢制主梁乃至主教座堂等惰性或被动的物体，是怎样产生所需的巨大反作用力的呢？

### 2.1 Hooke's law – or the springiness of solids

The power of any Spring is in the same proportion with the Tension* thereof: That is, if one power stretch or bend it one space, two will bend it two, three will bend it three, and so forward. And this is the Rule or Law of Nature, upon which all manner of Restituent or Springing motion doth proceed.

Robert Hooke

By about 1676 Hooke saw clearly that, not only must solids resist weights or other mechanical loads by pushing back at them, but also that

1 Every kind of solid changes its shape – by stretching or contracting itself- when a mechanical force is applied to it.

Figures 4 and 5. All materials and structures deflect, to greatly varying extents, when they are loaded. The science of elasticity is about the interactions between forces and deflections. The material of the bough is stretched near its upper surface and compressed or contracted near its lower surface by the weight of the monkey.

2 It is this change of shape which enables the solid to do the pushing back.

Thus, when we hang a brick from the end of a piece of string, the string gets longer, and it is just this stretching which enables the string to pull upwards on the brick and so prevent it from falling. All materials and structures deflect, although to greatly varying extents, when they are loaded (Figures 4 and 5).

It is important to realize that it is perfectly normal for any and every structure to deflect in response to a load. Unless this deflection is too large for the purposes of the structure, it is not in any way a 'fault' but rather an essential characteristic without which no structure would be able to work. The science of elasticity is about the interactions between forces and deflections in materials and structures.

Although every kind of solid changes its shape to some extent when a weight or other mechanical force is applied to it, the deflections which occur in practice vary enormously. With a thing like a plant or a piece of rubber the deflections are often very large and are easily seen, but when we put ordinary loads on hard substances like metal or concrete or bone the deflections are sometimes very small indeed. Although such movements are often far too small to see with the naked eye, they always exist and are perfectly real, even though we may need special appliances in order to measure them. When you climb the tower of a cathedral it becomes shorter, as a result of your added weight, by a very, very tiny amount, but it really does become shorter. As a matter of fact, masonry is really more flexible than you might think, as one can see by looking at the four principal columns which support the tower of Salisbury Cathedral: they are all quite noticeably bent (Plate 1).

Hooke made a further important step in his reasoning which, even nowadays, some people find difficult to follow. He realized that, when any structure deflects under load in the way we have been talking about, the material from which it is made is itself also stretched or contracted, internally, throughout all its parts and in due proportion, down to a very fine scale – as we know nowadays, down to a molecular scale. Thus, when we deform a stick or a steel spring – say by bending it – the atoms and molecules of which the material is made have to move further apart, or else squash closer together, when the material as a whole is stretched or compressed.

As we also know nowadays, the chemical bonds which join the atoms to each other, and so hold the solid together, are very strong and stiff indeed. So when the material as a whole is stretched or compressed this can only be done by stretching of compressing many millions of strong chemical bonds which vigorously resist being deformed, even to a very small extent. Thus these bonds produce the required large forces of reaction (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Simplified model of distortion of interatomic bonds under mechanical strain.

(a) Neutral, relaxed or strain-free position.

(b) Material strained in tension, atoms further apart, material gets longer.

(c) Material strained in compression, atoms closer together, material gets shorter.

Although Hooke knew nothing in detail about chemical bonds and not very much about atoms and molecules, he understood perfectly well that something of this kind was happening within the fine structure of the material, and he set out to determine what might be the nature of the macroscopic relationship between forces and deflections in solids.

He tested a variety of objects made from various materials and having various geometrical forms, such as springs and wires and beams. Having hung a succession of weights upon them and measured the resulting deflections, he showed that the deflection in any given structure was usually proportional to the load. That is to say, a load of 200 pounds would cause twice as much deflection as a load of 100 pounds 'and so forward'.

Furthermore, within the accuracy of Hooke's measurements -which was not very good – most of these solids recovered their original shape when the load which was causing the deflection was removed. In fact he could usually go on loading and unloading structures of this kind indefinitely without causing any permanent change of shape. Such behaviour is called 'elastic' and is common. The word is often associated with rubber bands and underclothes, but it is just as applicable to steel and stone and brick and to biological substances like wood and bone and tendon. It is in this wider sense that engineers generally use it. Incidentally, the 'ping' of the mosquito, for instance, is due to the highly elastic behaviour of the resilin springs which operate its wings.

However, a certain number of solids and near-solids, like putty and plasticine, do not recover completely but remain distorted when the load is taken off. This kind of behaviour is called 'plastic'. The word is by no means confined to the materials from which ashtrays are usually made but is also applied to clay and to soft metals. Such plastic substances shade off into things like butter and porridge and treacle. Furthermore, many of the materials which Hooke considered to be 'elastic' turn out to be imperfectly so when tested by more accurate modern methods.

However, as a broad generalization, Hooke's observations remain true and still provide the basis of the modern science of elasticity. Nowadays, and with hindsight, the idea that most materials and structures, not only machinery and bridges and buildings but also trees and animals and rocks and mountains and the round world itself, behave very much like springs may seem simple enough – perhaps blindingly obvious – but, from his diary, it is clear that to get thus far cost Hooke great mental effort and many doubts. It is perhaps one of the great intellectual achievements of history.

After he had tried out his ideas on Sir Christopher Wren in a series of private arguments, Hooke published his experiments in 1679 in a paper called 'De potentia restitutiva or of a spring'. This paper contained the famous statement 'ut tensio sic vis' ('as the extension, so the force'). This principle has been known for three hundred years as 'Hooke's law'

胡克定律

任意弹簧的力量都与其伸长量 [3] 成正比。也就是说，若一倍力使其伸长或弯曲一个单位，那么，两倍力会使其伸长或弯曲两个单位，三倍力会使其伸长或弯曲三个单位，以下类推。这是大自然的法则或规律，各种恢复或弹振运动都遵循。

—— 罗伯特·胡克

1-2『终于见正主了，胡克定律，上学那会是学到，但压根没有意识到「它」如此重要，可以说是真个结构学的「根基」。做一张主题卡片。（2021-06-19）』—— 已完成

大约 1676 年，胡克清楚地认识到，固体不仅靠反推对抗重量或其他机械载荷，还会产生两个效果：1）当机械性力量施加其上时，固体会发生形变 —— 拉伸或收缩自身。2）正是这种形变使固体能够实现反推。

因此，当我们在一根绳子的末端挂一块砖头时，绳子会伸长，这种拉伸使绳向上拉砖块，防止其掉落。所有材料和结构在负载时都会发生挠变，但程度各不相同（见图 2–4 和图 2–5）。

图 2–4 和图 2–5 所有材料和结构在负载时都会发生挠变，但程度各不相同。弹性科学致力于研究力量和挠度之间的相互关系。树枝受猴子重量的影响，在上表面附近被拉伸，在下表面附近受到挤压或收缩

重要的是，要意识到任何一个结构对载荷做出挠变的反应都是完全正常的。除非其挠度对该结构的用途而言太大了，否则这根本不算一个「错误」，反而是一种基本属性 —— 要是没有它，任何结构都无法起作用。弹性科学研究的就是关于材料和结构中力量与挠度之间的相互关系。

1『材料科学研究的核心：材料和结构中，力量和挠度之间的相互关系。（2021-06-19）』

虽然每种固体在重量或其他机械性力量的作用下，都会在一定程度上发生形变，但其挠度在现实中千差万别。对于植物或橡胶等，挠变往往非常大且十分明显，但当我们把普通的负荷加载到金属、混凝土或骨骼之类的坚硬材质上时，挠变有时就非常小。虽然这些形变往往太微小以至于肉眼不可见，但它们真实存在，可能要用特殊的器械来测量。当你爬上一座主教座堂的塔楼时，塔楼变矮了，这是它承载了你的体重的结果，虽然其形变量非常小，但它确实变矮了。事实上，砖石建筑比你想象的更柔韧，正如人们看到的，索尔兹伯里大教堂的塔楼被 4 根支柱支撑着：它们都明显地发生了弯曲（见插图 1）。

胡克在他的推理之路上又迈出了重要的一步，即便到今日，有些人仍觉得难以跟上他的思路。他意识到，当任意结构在载荷作用下发生挠变时，构成它的材料本身在其内部各处也会以非常精细的尺度按适当比例拉伸或收缩，小至分子尺度亦如此。因此，当我们使一根棍子或一根钢弹簧发生变形（比如掰弯它）时，材料整体被拉伸或挤压，构成材料的原子和分子也将分离得更远或者聚集得更近。

我们今天也知道，原子间彼此通过化学键相连，凝聚为固体后，质地变得非常强韧。所以，当材料整体被拉伸或挤压时，只能通过拉伸或压缩数以百万计的强大的化学键来实现，这些化学键顽强地抵抗形变，即便在非常小的尺度上亦如此。因此，这些化学键产生了强大的反作用力（见图 2–6）。

1『震撼，是「化学键」提供了反向作用力，一下子跟之前学「量子电动力学」知识点关联上了，难怪费曼说量子电动力学可以解释除了「原子核内部的力」「大尺度的相对论」之外的任何现象。（2021-06-19）』

虽然胡克对化学键一无所知，对原子和分子也不太了解，但他完全能理解在材料的精细结构中发生的这些变化，他也着手确定固体中力和挠度在宏观上相互关联的本质是什么。

他的测试对象包括各种材料构成和几何形态，比如弹簧、金属丝和横梁。通过在这些物体上悬挂一系列配重并测量其产生的挠度，他揭示出任意给定结构的挠度通常与载荷成正比。也就是说，200 磅载荷产生的挠度是 100 磅载荷的两倍，「以下类推」。

而且，在胡克测量的精度（并不太精确）内，当移除产生挠度的载荷后，这些固体大多恢复至原始形状。这意味着他可以无限地加载和卸载这类结构，而不会导致任何永久性形变。这种表现被称为「弹性」，它普遍存在。弹性经常同橡皮筋和内衣裤联系在一起，但它同样适用于钢材、石头和砖块，以及像木材、骨骼和肌腱这样的生物材质。正是在这种广泛的意义上，工程师频繁使用它。顺便说一下，蚊子发出的砰砰声就源于控制它翅膀的节肢弹性蛋白的极大弹性。

图 2–6 机械应变下原子间化学键发生畸变的简化模型：a）中性、松弛或无应变的状态；b）材料受拉应变，原子分离得更远，材料变得更长；c）材料受压应变，原子聚集得更近，材料变得更短

然而，对于某些固体和近固体，比如油灰和橡皮泥，当其负荷被卸载时，并不能完全恢复原状，只能维持形变，这叫作「塑性」。塑性材料不仅包括用来做烟灰缸的材料，也包括黏土和软金属。这类材料会逐渐变成像黄油、麦片粥和糖浆一样。此外，用更精确的现代测试方法来衡量，许多被胡克认定为具有弹性的材料，实则并非如此。

但是，胡克的观察作为一种宽泛的归纳仍然是合理的，也为现代弹性科学奠定了基础。时至今日回头看，大部分材料和结构 —— 不仅包括机械、桥梁和建筑物，还有树木、动物、岩石、山丘以及地球本身 —— 皆被视为弹簧的观念，可能看似很简单（或许显而易见），但通过胡克的日记我们看到，他为此花费了很多心血，也产生了很多疑问。这或许是历史上最伟大的智慧成果之一。

在同克里斯托弗·雷恩爵士（Sir Christopher Wren）的一系列私下争论中，胡克提炼出自己的观念。1679 年，他在论文《论恢复的潜力 —— 弹簧》中公布了他的实验。文章里有一句著名的论断，「延伸则有力」。300 年来，我们称这个原理为「胡克定律」。

### 2.2 How elasticity got bogged down

But to make an enemy of Newton was fatal. For Newton, right or wrong, was implacable.

Margaret 'Espinasse, Robert Hooke (Heinemann, 1956)

Although in modern times Hooke's law has been of the very greatest service to engineers, in the form in which Hooke originally propounded it its practical usefulness was rather limited. Hooke was really talking about the deflections of a complete structure – a spring, a bridge or a tree – when a load is applied to it.

If we think for one moment, it is obvious that the deflection of a structure is affected both by its size and geometrical shape and also by the sort of material from which it is made. Materials vary very greatly in their intrinsic stiffness. Things like rubber or flesh are easily distorted by small forces which we can apply with our fingers. Other substances such as wood and bone and stone and most metals are very considerably stiffer, and, although no material can be absolutely 'rigid', a few solids like sapphire and diamond are very stiff indeed.

We can make objects of the same size and shape, such as ordinary plumber's washers, out of steel and also out of rubber. It is clear that the steel washer is very much more rigid (in fact about 30,000 times more rigid) than the rubber one. Again, if we make a thin spiral spring and also a thick and massive girder from the same material – such as steel – then the spring will naturally be very much more flexible than the girder. We need to be able to separate and to quantify these effects, for in engineering, as in biology, we are ringing the changes of these variables all the time and we need some reliable way of sorting the whole thing out.

After such a promising start it is rather surprising that no scientific way of coping with this difficulty emerged until 120 years after Hooke's death. In fact, throughout the eighteenth century remarkably little real progress was made in the study of elasticity. The reasons for this lack of progress were no doubt complex, but in general it can be said that, while the scientists of the seventeenth century saw their science as interwoven with the progress of technology – a vision of the purpose of science which was then almost new in history – many of the scientists of the eighteenth century thought of themselves as philosophers working on a plane which was altogether superior to the sordid problems of manufacturing and commerce. This was, of course, a reversion to the Greek view of science. Hooke's law provided a broad philosophical explanation of some rather commonplace phenomena which was quite adequate for the gentleman-philosopher who was not very interested in the technical details.

With all this, however, we cannot leave out the personal influence of Newton (1642–1727) himself or the after-effects of the bitter enmity which existed between Newton and Hooke. Intellectually, Hooke was probably nearly as able as Newton, and he was certainly even more touchy and vain; but in other respects they were men of totally different temperaments and interests. Basically, although they both came from fairly modest backgrounds, Newton was a snob whereas Hooke, though a personal friend of Charles II, was not.

Unlike Newton, Hooke was an earthy sort of person who was occupied with an enormous number of very practical problems about elasticity and springs and clocks and buildings and microscopes and the anatomy of the common flea. Among Hooke's inventions which are still in use today are the universal joint, used in car transmissions, and the iris diaphragm, which is used in most cameras. Hooke's carriage lamp, in which, as the candle burnt down, its flame was kept in the centre of the optical system by means of a spring feed, went out of use only in the 1920s. Such lamps are still to be seen outside people's front doors. Furthermore, Hooke's private life out-sinned that of his friend Samuel Pepys: not only was every servant girl fair game to him, but he lived for many years 'perfecte intime omne'* with his attractive niece.

Newton's vision of the Universe may have been wider than Hooke's, but his interest in science was much less practical. In fact, like that of many lesser dons, it could often be described as anti-practical. It is true that Newton became Master of the Mint and did the job well, but it seems that his acceptance of the post had little to do with any desire to apply science and a lot to do with the fact that this was a 'place under Government' which, in those days, conferred a much higher social position than his fellowship of Trinity, not to mention a higher salary. A great deal of Newton's time, however, was spent in a curious world of his own in which he speculated about such perplexing theological problems as the Number of the Beast. I don't think he had much time or inclination to indulge in the sins of the flesh.

In short, Newton was well constituted to detest Hooke as a man and to loathe everything he stood for, down to and including elasticity. It so happened that Newton had the good fortune to live on for twenty-five years after Hooke died, and he devoted a good deal of this time to denigrating Hooke's memory and the importance of applied science. Since Newton had, by then, an almost God-like position in the scientific world, and since all this tended to reinforce the social and intellectual tendencies of the age, subjects like structures suffered heavily in popularity, even for many years after Newton's death.

Thus the situation throughout the eighteenth century was that, while the manner in which structures worked had been explained in a broad general way by Hooke, his work was not much followed up or exploited, and so the subject remained in such a condition that detailed practical calculations were scarcely possible.

So long as this state of affairs continued the usefulness of theoretical elasticity in engineering was limited. French eighteenth century engineers were aware of this but regretted it and tried to build structures (which quite often fell down) making use of such theory as was available to them. English engineers, who were also aware of it, were usually indifferent to 'theory' and they built the structures of the Industrial Revolution by rule-of-thumb 'practical' methods. These structures probably fell down nearly, but not quite, as often.

*In Hooke's time 'tension' meant what we should call 'extension', just as 'tensio' did in Latin.

*Hooke's own phrase. Her name was Grace.

弹性的失灵

然而，与牛顿为敌是要命的。对牛顿来说，无论对错，绝不妥协。

—— 玛格丽特·埃斯皮纳斯（Margaret 'Espinasse），

《罗伯特·胡克》（Robert Hooke）

虽然在现代，胡克定律对工程师来说用处极大，但就胡克最初给出的形式而言，其实际效用相当有限。胡克描述的实际上是一个完整的结构，如一根弹簧、一座桥或一棵树在被施加载荷时的挠度。

若我们想一想，很快就会发现，一个结构的尺寸和几何形状，及其构成材料的种类，都会影响它的挠度。材料固有的刚度差异极大：橡胶或肉等容易被手指施加的轻微力量弄变形；但其他材质，比如木材、骨骼、岩石和大多数金属，则强劲得多。尽管没有材料能够达到绝对的「刚性」，但蓝宝石和金刚钻等少数固体确实非常强劲。

我们可以用钢材和橡胶制造同样尺寸和形状的物体，比如普通的水管垫圈。很明显，钢制垫圈的刚性要比橡胶制垫圈大得多（实际上前者约为后者的 30 000 倍）。如果我们用同一种材料（如钢材）制作一个细螺旋弹簧和一个粗大的主梁，那么弹簧自然会比主梁更柔韧。我们需要在工程中区分和量化这些效应，就像在生物学中一样，通过重复这些参数的变化，找到梳理整件事情的可靠方法。

虽然有这样一个前途光明的开端，但令人惊讶的是，直到胡克去世 120 年后，人们仍未找到应对这个难题的科学方法。事实上，在 18 世纪，弹性研究取得的实质进展微乎其微。进展不足的原因很复杂，但大致上是因为，17 世纪的科学家认为科学是与技术进步交织在一起的（这是科学发展的愿景，科学当时还是历史上的新兴事物），而 18 世纪的许多科学家则自视为哲学家，并认为他们的工作层次完全高于制造业和商业活动中的鸡毛蒜皮。当然，这是一种对希腊科学观的回归。既然胡克定律已经为一些相当常见的现象提供了一种宽泛的哲学解释，这对不甚关心技术细节的绅士哲学家来说就足够了。

然而，除了上述种种，我们也不能忽略牛顿的个人影响，或者牛顿和胡克之间是非恩怨的后遗症。就智力而言，胡克几乎能与牛顿比肩，当然前者更敏感且自负；但在其他方面，二人的性格和志趣截然不同。总的来说，虽然二人都出身寒微，但牛顿更热衷攀附权贵，而胡克虽与查理二世有私谊，却无心经营。

和牛顿不同，胡克是一个朴实的人，他沉迷于大量实际的难题，包括弹性、弹簧、钟表、建筑、显微镜和解剖常见的跳蚤等。胡克的一些发明至今仍在使用，比如，用于车辆变速器的万向接头和用于大多数相机的可变光圈。胡克发明的马车灯，其中蜡烛的火焰借助弹簧进给运动保持在光学系统的中心，直到 20 世纪 20 年代才被淘汰。此外，胡克的私生活比他的朋友萨缪尔·佩皮斯（Samuel Pepys）更混乱：他不仅勾搭每个女仆，还同他漂亮的侄女共度了一段「妙不可言」[4] 的时光。

2『胡克除胡克定律之前其他的发明，做一张信息数据卡片。』

牛顿的宇宙图景或许比胡克宽广，但他的科学研究不大注重实用性。事实上，就像许多小教员，牛顿对科学的志趣常常是不切实际的。的确，牛顿在造币厂厂长的位置上尽职尽责，但他接受这个职位似乎与对应用科学的追求不甚相干，却和下述事实关系甚大。造币厂是个「政府治下的地盘」，在当时能带给他远高于剑桥三一学院研究员职位的社会地位，以及更丰厚的薪水。但是，牛顿将大量时间都花在了他的秘密世界中，他在其中推演诸如野兽数 [5] 这样玄妙的神学难题。所以，我认为他没有多少时间或欲望沉溺于肉体的罪恶。

简而言之，牛顿打从心底里厌恶胡克，也讨厌胡克追求的一切，包括弹性。胡克去世后，牛顿继续在这个世界上存活了 24 年，他将其中的大部分时间用来诋毁胡克的成就和应用科学的重要性。自那时起，牛顿在科学世界里获得了近乎上帝的地位，凡此种种皆趋向于强化那个时代社会和智识的风尚，故而像结构这样的课题，即便在牛顿辞世多年后，也颇为流行。

因此，在 18 世纪，虽然胡克宽泛地解释了结构的运作方式，但他的工作并没有得到足够的跟进或拓展，具体的实用性计算也未见端倪。

如果这样的状况持续下去，弹性理论在工程中的运用就会备受限制。18 世纪的法国工程师意识到了这一点，很是惋惜，于是试图运用既有理论来建造结构（却常常坍塌）。英国的工程师也意识到了这一点，但他们往往对「理论」漠不关心，而是靠经验法则来构建工业革命时代的结构。这些结构大多坍塌了，但也留下了一些。

[3] 在胡克的时代，「拉伸」（tension）表示我们今天所说的「伸长量」（extension），与拉丁文「tensio」的意思相同。

[4] 这是胡克自己的说法。他的侄女名叫格蕾丝（Grace）。

[5] 野兽数是基督教文明中一个象征邪恶的数，源于《圣经·新约全书·启示录》。在大部分的《圣经》版本中，这个数被记作 666。—— 译者注
