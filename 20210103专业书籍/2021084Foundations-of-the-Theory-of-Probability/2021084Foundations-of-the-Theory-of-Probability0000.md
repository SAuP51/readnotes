This Dover edition, first published in 2018, is an unabridged republication of the 1956 second edition of the work originally published in 1950 by Chelsea Publishing Company, New York.

## Preface

The purpose of this monograph is to give an axiomatic foundation for the theory of probability. The author set himself the task of putting in their natural place, among the general notions of modern mathematics, the basic concepts of probability theory — concepts which until recently were considered to be quite peculiar.

This task would have been a rather hopeless one before the introduction of Lebesgue's theories of measure and integration. However, after Lebesgue's publication of his investigations, the analogies between measure of a set and probability of an event, and between integral of a function and mathematical expectation of a random variable, became apparent. These analogies allowed of further extensions; thus, for example, various properties of independent random variables were seen to be in complete analogy with the corresponding properties of orthogonal functions. But if probability theory was to be based on the above analogies, it still was necessary to make the theories of measure and integration independent of the geometric elements which were in the foreground with Lebesgue. This has been done by Fréchet.

While a conception of probability theory based on the above general viewpoints has been current for some time among certain mathematicians, there was lacking a complete exposition of the whole system, free of extraneous complications. (Cf., however, the book by Fréchet, [2] in the bibliography.)

I wish to call attention to those points of the present exposition which are outside the above-mentioned range of ideas familiar to the specialist. They are the following: Probability distributions in infinite-dimensional spaces (Chapter III, § 4) ; differentiation and integration of mathematical expectations with respect to a parameter (Chapter IV, § 5) ; and especially the theory of conditional probabilities and conditional expectations (Chapter V). It should be emphasized that these new problems arose, of necessity, from some perfectly concrete physical problems.[1]

The sixth chapter contains a survey, without proofs, of some results of A. Khinchine and the author of the limitations on the applicability of the ordinary and of the strong law of large numbers. The bibliography contains some recent works which should be of interest from the point of view of the foundations of the subject.

I wish to express my warm thanks to Mr. Khinchine, who has read carefully the whole manuscript and proposed several improvements.

The purpose of this monograph is to give an axiomatic foundation for the theory of probability. The author set himself the task of putting in their natural place, among the general notions of modern mathematics, the basic concepts of probability theory — concepts which until recently were considered to be quite peculiar.

这篇专论的目的是为概率理论提供一个公理化的基础。作者设定了一个任务，即将概率理论的基本概念放在现代数学的一般概念中的自然位置 —— 这些概念直到最近还被认为是相当特殊的。

This task would have been a rather hopeless one before the introduction of Lebesgue's theories of measure and integration. However, after Lebesgue's publication of his investigations, the analogies between measure of a set and probability of an event, and between integral of a function and mathematical expectation of a random variable, became apparent. These analogies allowed of further extensions; thus, for example, various properties of independent random variables were seen to be in complete analogy with the corresponding properties of orthogonal functions.

在勒贝格的测量和积分理论引入之前，这个任务几乎是没有希望的。然而，在勒贝格发表他的研究之后，集合的测度与事件的概率、函数的积分与随机变量的数学期望之间的类比变得明显。这些类比使得进一步的扩展成为可能；因此，例如，独立随机变量的各种性质被发现与正交函数的相应性质完全类似。

But if probability theory was to be based on the above analogies, it still was necessary to make the theories of measure and integration independent of the geometric elements which were in the foreground with Lebesgue. This has been done by Fréchet.

但如果概率理论要基于上述类比，仍然需要使测量和积分理论独立于勒贝格强调的几何元素。这一任务已由弗雷歇完成。

While a conception of probability theory based on the above general viewpoints has been current for some time among certain mathematicians, there was lacking a complete exposition of the whole system, free of extraneous complications. (Cf., however, the book by Fréchet, [2] in the bibliography.)

尽管基于上述一般观点的概率理论观念在某些数学家中已流行一段时间，但还缺乏一个完整的、不涉及外在复杂性的整个系统的阐述。（然而，参见参考书目中弗雷歇的著作 [2]。）

I wish to call attention to those points of the present exposition which are outside the above-mentioned range of ideas familiar to the specialist. They are the following: Probability distributions in infinite-dimensional spaces (Chapter III, § 4) ; differentiation and integration of mathematical expectations with respect to a parameter (Chapter IV, § 5) ; and especially the theory of conditional probabilities and conditional expectations (Chapter V). It should be emphasized that these new problems arose, of necessity, from some perfectly concrete physical problems.[1]

我希望引起人们对目前这种阐述中那些超出专家熟悉的上述观点范围的几点的关注。它们包括：无限维空间中的概率分布（第三章，第 4 节）；关于参数的数学期望的微分和积分（第四章，第 5 节）；尤其是条件概率和条件期望的理论（第五章）。应该强调的是，这些新问题是必然地从一些完全具体的物理问题中产生的。[1]

The sixth chapter contains a survey, without proofs, of some results of A. Khinchine and the author of the limitations on the applicability of the ordinary and of the strong law of large numbers. The bibliography contains some recent works which should be of interest from the point of view of the foundations of the subject.

第六章包含了一项调查，没有证据，关于 A. Khinchine 和作者对普通大数定律和强大数定律适用性限制的一些结果。参考书目包含了一些从学科基础的角度看应该感兴趣的最新作品。

I wish to express my warm thanks to Mr. Khinchine, who has read carefully the whole manuscript and proposed several improvements.

我要向仔细阅读了整个手稿并提出了几项改进建议的 Khinchine 先生表示衷心的感谢。
