ZERO-OR-ONE LAW IN THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY

We have noticed several cases in which certain limiting probabilities are necessarily equal to zero or one. For example, the probability of convergence of a series of independent random variables may assume only these two values1. We shall prove now a general theorem including many such cases.

THEOREM : Let x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . be any random variables and let f(x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .) be a Baire function2 of the variables x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . such that the conditional probability

of the relation

remains, when the first n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn are known, equal to the absolute probability

for every n. Under these conditions the probability (1) equals zero or one.

In particular, the assumptions of this theorem are fulfilled if the variables xn are mutually independent and if the value of the function f(x) remains unchanged when only a finite number of variables are changed.

Proof of the Theorem : Let us denote by A the event

We shall also investigate the field of all events which can be defined through some relations among a finite number of variables xn. If event B belongs to , then, according to the conditions of the theorem,

In the case our theorem is already true. Let now . Then from (2) follows the formula

and therefore and are two completely additive set functions, coinciding on ; therefore they must remain equal to each other on every set of the Borel extension of the field . Therefore, in particular,

which proves our theorem.

Several other cases in which we can state that certain probabilities can assume only the values one and zero, were discovered by P. Lévy. See P. LÉVY, Sur un théorème de M. Khintchine, Bull, des Sci. Math. v. 55, 1931, pp. 145–160, Theorem II.

1 Cf. Chap. VI, § 5. The same thingis true of the probability

in the strong law of large numbers ; at least, when the variables xn are mutually independent.

2 A Baire function is one which can be obtained by successive passages to the limit, of sequences of functions, starting with polynomials.
