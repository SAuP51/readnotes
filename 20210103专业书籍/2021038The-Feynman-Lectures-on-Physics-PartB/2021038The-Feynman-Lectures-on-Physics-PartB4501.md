30-1 The internal geometry of crystalsWe

have ﬁnished the study of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism,and we are now going to study the electromagnetic properties of matter. Webegin by describing solids—that is, crystals. When the atoms of matter are notmoving around very much, they get stuck together and arrange themselves in aconﬁguration with as low an energy as possible. If the atoms in a certain placehave found a pattern which seems to be of low energy, then the atoms somewhereelse will probably make the same arrangement. For these reasons, we have in asolid material a repetitive pattern of atoms.

In other words, the conditions in a crystal are this way: The environment ofa particular atom in a crystal has a certain arrangement, and if you look at thesame kind of an atom at another place farther along, you will ﬁnd one whosesurroundings are exactly the same. If you pick an atom farther along by thesame distance, you will ﬁnd the conditions exactly the same once more. Thepattern is repeated over and over again—and, of course, in three dimensions.

Imagine the problem of designing a wallpaper—or a cloth, or some geometricdesign for a plane area—in which you are supposed to have a design elementwhich repeats and repeats and repeats, so that you can make the area as large asyou want. This is the two-dimensional analog of a problem which a crystal solvesin three dimensions. For example, Fig. 30-1(a) shows a common kind of wallpaperdesign. There is a single element repeated in a pattern that can go on forever. Thegeometric characteristics of this wallpaper design, considering only its repetitionproperties and not worrying about the geometry of the ﬂower itself or its artisticmerit, are contained in Fig. 30-1(b). If you start at any point, you can ﬁnd thecorresponding point by moving the distance a along the direction of arrow 1. Youcan also get to a corresponding point if you move the distance b in the directionof the other arrow. There are, of course, many other directions. You can go, forexample, from point α to point β and reach a corresponding position, but such astep can be considered as a combination of a step along direction 1, followed by astep along direction 2. One of the basic properties of the pattern can be describedby the two shortest steps to nearby equal positions. By「equal」positions we meanthat if you were to stand in any one of them and look around you, you wouldsee exactly the same thing as if you were to stand in another one. That’s thefundamental property of a crystal. The only diﬀerence is that a crystal is a three-dimensional arrangement instead of a two-dimensional arrangement; and naturally,instead of ﬂowers, each element of the lattice is some kind of an arrangementof atoms—perhaps six hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms—in some kind ofpattern. The pattern of atoms in a crystal can be found out experimentally byx-ray diﬀraction. We have mentioned this method brieﬂy before, and won’t sayany more now except that the precise arrangement of the atoms in space hasbeen worked out for most simple crystals and also for some fairly complex ones.The internal pattern of a crystal shows up in several ways. First, the bindingstrength of the atoms in certain directions is usually stronger than in otherdirections. This means that there are certain planes through the crystal where itis more easily broken than others. They are called the cleavage planes. If youcrack a crystal with a knife blade it will often split apart along such a plane.Second, the internal structure often appears at the surface because of the way thecrystal was formed. Imagine a crystal being deposited out of a solution. Thereare the atoms ﬂoating around in the solution and ﬁnally settling down when they30-1

ﬁnd a position of lowest energy. (It’s as if the wallpaper got made by ﬂowersdrifting around until one drifted accidentally into place and got stuck, and thenthe next, and the next so that the pattern gradually grows.) You can appreciatethat there will be certain directions in which it will grow at a diﬀerent speedthan in other directions, thereby growing into some kind of geometrical shape.Because of such eﬀects, the outside surfaces of many crystals show some of thecharacter of the internal arrangement of the atoms.

For example, Fig. 30-2(a) shows the shape of a typical quartz crystal whoseinternal pattern is hexagonal. If you look closely at such a crystal, you will noticethat the outside does not make a very good hexagon because the sides are notall of equal length—they are, in fact, often very unequal. But in one respect itis a very good hexagon: the angles between the faces are exactly 120◦. Clearly,the size of any particular face is an accident of the growth, but the angles are arepresentation of the internal geometry. So every crystal of quartz has a diﬀerentshape, even though the angles between corresponding faces are always the same.The internal geometry of a crystal of sodium chloride is also evident from itsexternal shape. Figure 30-2(b) shows the shape of a typical grain of salt. Againthe crystal is not a perfect cube, but the faces are exactly at right angles to oneanother.A more complicated crystal is mica, which has the shape shown in Fig. 30-2(c).It is a highly anisotropic crystal, as is easily seen from the fact that it is very toughif you try to pull it apart in one direction (horizontally in the ﬁgure), but veryeasy to split by pulling apart in the other direction (vertically). It has commonlybeen used to obtain very tough, thin sheets. Mica and quartz are two examplesof natural minerals containing silica. A third example of a mineral with silica isasbestos, which has the interesting property that it is easily pulled apart in twodirections but not in the third. It appears to be made of very strong, linear ﬁbers.

30-2 Chemical bonds in crystalsThe mechanical properties of crystals clearly depend on the kind of chemicalbindings between the atoms. The strikingly diﬀerent strength of mica alongdiﬀerent directions depends on the kinds of interatomic binding in the diﬀerentdirections. You have already learned in chemistry, no doubt, about the diﬀerentkinds of chemical bonds. First, there are ionic bonds, as we have already discussedfor sodium chloride. Roughly speaking, the sodium atoms have lost an electronand become positive ions; the chlorine atoms have gained an electron and becomenegative ions. The positive and negative ions are arranged in a three-dimensionalcheckerboard and are held together by electrical forces.

The covalent bond—in which electrons are shared between two atoms—is morecommon and is usually very strong. In a diamond, for example, the carbon atomshave covalent bonds in all four directions to the nearest neighbors, so the crystalis very hard indeed. There is also covalent bonding between silicon and oxygenin a quartz crystal, but there the bond is really only partially covalent. Becausethere is not complete sharing of the electrons, the atoms are partly charged, andthe crystal is somewhat ionic. Nature is not as simple as we try to make it; thereare really all possible gradations between covalent and ionic bonding.

A sugar crystal has still another kind of binding. In it there are large moleculesin which the atoms are held strongly together by covalent bonds, so that themolecule is a tough structure. But since the strong bonds are completely satis-ﬁed, there are only relatively weak attractions between the separate, individualmolecules. In such molecular crystals the molecules keep their individual identity,so to speak, and the internal arrangement might be as shown in Fig. 30-3. Sincethe molecules are not held strongly to each other, the crystals are easy to break.They are quite diﬀerent from something like diamond, which is really one giantmolecule that cannot be broken anywhere without disrupting strong covalentbonds. Paraﬃn is another example of a molecular crystal.

An extreme example of a molecular crystal occurs in a substance like solidargon. There is very little attraction between the atoms—each atom is a com-30-2

pletely saturated monatomic molecule. But at very low temperatures, the thermalmotion is very small, so the slight interatomic forces can cause the atoms tosettle down into a regular array like a pile of closely packed spheres.

The metals form a completely diﬀerent class of substances. The bonding is ofan entirely diﬀerent kind. In a metal the bonding is not between adjacent atomsbut is a property of the whole crystal. The valence electrons are not attachedto one atom or to a pair of atoms but are shared throughout the crystal. Eachatom contributes an electron to a universal pool of electrons, and the atomicpositive ions reside in the sea of negative electrons. The electron sea holds theions together like some kind of glue.

In the metals, since there are no special bonds in any particular direction,there is no strong directionality in the binding. They are still crystalline, however,because the total energy is lowest when the atomic ions are arranged in somedeﬁnite array—although the energy of the preferred arrangement is not usuallymuch lower than other possible ones. To a ﬁrst approximation, the atoms ofmany metals are like small spheres packed in as tightly as possible.

30-3 The growth of crystalsTry to imagine the natural formation of crystals in the earth. In the earth’ssurface there is a big mixture of all kinds of atoms. They are being continuallychurned about by volcanic action, by wind, and by water—continually beingmoved about and mixed. Yet, by some trick, silicon atoms gradually begin toﬁnd each other, and to ﬁnd oxygen atoms, to make silica. One atom at a timeis added to the others to build up a crystal—the mixture gets unmixed. Andsomewhere nearby, sodium and chlorine atoms are ﬁnding each other and buildingup a crystal of salt.

How does it happen that once a crystal is started, it permits only a particularkind of atom to join on? It happens because the whole system is working towardthe lowest possible energy. A growing crystal will accept a new atom if it isgoing to make the energy as low as possible. But how does it know that asilicon—or an oxygen—atom at some particular spot is going to result in thelowest possible energy? It does it by trial and error. In the liquid, all of theatoms are in perpetual motion. Each atom bounces against its neighbors about1013 times every second. If it hits against the right spot of growing crystal, ithas a somewhat smaller chance of jumping oﬀ again if the energy is low. Bycontinually testing over periods of millions of years at a rate of 1013 tests persecond, the atoms gradually build up at the places where they ﬁnd their lowestenergy. Eventually they grow into big crystals.

30-4 Crystal latticesThe arrangement of the atoms in a crystal—the crystal lattice—can take onmany geometric forms. We would like to describe ﬁrst the simplest lattices, whichare characteristic of most of the metals and of the solid form of the inert gases.They are the cubic lattices which can occur in two forms: the body-centeredcubic, shown in Fig. 30-4(a), and the face-centered cubic shown in Fig. 30-4(b).The drawings show, of course, only one cube of the lattice; you are to imaginethat the pattern is repeated indeﬁnitely in three dimensions. Also, to make thedrawing clearer, only the「centers」of the atoms are shown. In an actual crystal,the atoms are more like spheres in contact with each other. The dark and lightspheres in the drawings may, in general, stand for diﬀerent kinds of atoms ormay be the same kind. For instance, iron has a body-centered cubic lattice atlow temperatures, but a face-centered cubic lattice at higher temperatures. Thephysical properties are quite diﬀerent in the two crystalline forms.

How do such forms come about? Imagine that you have the problem of packingspherical atoms together as tightly as possible. One way would be to start bymaking a layer in a「hexagonal close-packed array,」as shown in Fig. 30-5(a).Then you could build up a second layer like the ﬁrst, but displaced horizontally,30-3

(a) body-centered, (b) face-centered.

Fig. 30-5. Building up a hexagonal close-packed lattice.

as shown in Fig. 30-5(b). Next, you can put on the third layer. But notice!There are two distinct ways of placing the third layer. If you start the third layerby placing an atom at A in Fig. 30-5(b), each atom in the third layer is directlyabove an atom of the bottom layer. On the other hand, if you start the thirdlayer by putting an atom at the position B, the atoms of the third layer will becentered at points exactly in the middle of a triangle formed by three atoms ofthe bottom layer. Any other starting place is equivalent to A or B, so there areonly two ways of placing the third layer.If the third layer has an atom at point B, the crystal lattice is a face-centeredcubic—but seen at an angle. It seems funny that starting with hexagons youcan end up with cubes. But notice that a cube looked at from a corner has ahexagonal outline. For instance, Fig. 30-6 could represent a plane hexagon or acube seen in perspective!

If a third layer is added to Fig. 30-5(b) by starting with an atom at A, thereis no cubical structure, and the lattice has instead only a hexagonal symmetry.It is clear that both possibilities we have described are equally close-packed.

Some metals—for example, copper and silver—choose the ﬁrst alternative, theface-centered cubic. Others—for example, beryllium and magnesium—choose theother alternatives; they form hexagonal crystals. Clearly, which crystal latticeappears cannot depend only on the packing of little spheres, but must also bedetermined in part by other factors.In particular, it depends on the slightremaining angular dependence of the interatomic forces (or, in the case of themetals, on the energy of the electron pool). You will, no doubt, learn all aboutsuch things in your chemistry courses.

30-5 Symmetries in two dimensionsWe would now like to discuss some of the properties of crystals from the pointof view of their internal symmetries. The main feature of a crystal is that if youstart at one atom and move to a corresponding atom one lattice unit away, you areagain in the same kind of an environment. That’s the fundamental proposition.But if you were an atom, there would be another kind of change that couldtake you again to the same environment—that is, another possible「symmetry.」Figure 30-7(a) shows another possible「wallpaper-type」design (though one youhave probably never seen). Suppose we compare the environments for points Aand B. You might, at ﬁrst, think that they are the same—but not quite. PointsC and D are equivalent to A, but the environment of B is like that of A only ifthe surroundings are reversed, as in a mirror reﬂection.

30-4

Is this a hexagon or a cube

seen from one corner?

Fig. 30-7. A pattern of high symmetry.

There are other kinds of「equivalent」points in the pattern. For instance, thepoints E and F have the「same」environments except that one is rotated 90◦with respect to the other. The pattern is quite special. A rotation of 90◦—or anymultiple of it—about a vertex such as A gives the same pattern all over again.A crystal with such a structure would have square corners on the outside, butinside it is more complicated than a simple cube.

Now that we have described some special examples, let’s try to ﬁgure out allthe possible symmetries a crystal can have. First, we consider what happens ina plane. A plane lattice can be deﬁned by the two so-called primitive vectorsthat go from one point of the lattice to the two nearest equivalent points. Thetwo vectors 1 and 2 are the primitive vectors of the lattice of Fig. 30-1. The twovectors a and b of Fig. 30-7(a) are the primitive vectors of the pattern there. Wecould, of course, equally well replace a by −a, or b by −b. Since a and b areequal in magnitude and at right angles, a rotation of 90◦ turns a into b, and binto −a, giving the same lattice once again.We see that there are lattices which have a「four-sided」symmetry. And wehave described earlier a close-packed array based on a hexagon which could havea six-sided symmetry. A rotation of the array of circles in Fig. 30-5(a) by anangle of 60◦ about the center of any circle brings the pattern back to itself.

What other kinds of rotational symmetry are there? Can we have, for example,a ﬁvefold or an eightfold rotational symmetry? It is easy to see that they areimpossible. The only symmetry with more sides than four is a six-sided symmetry.First, let’s show that more than sixfold symmetry is impossible. Suppose wetry to imagine a lattice with two equal primitive vectors with an enclosed angleless than 60◦, as in Fig. 30-8(a). We are to suppose that points B and C areequivalent to A, and that a and b are the two shortest vectors from A to itsequivalent neighbors. But that is clearly wrong, because the distance betweenB and C is shorter than from either one to A. There must be a neighbor at D0 as oneequivalent to A which is closer than B or C. We should have chosen bof our primitive vectors. So the angle between the two primitive vectors mustbe 60◦ or larger. Octagonal symmetry is not possible.

What about ﬁvefold symmetry? If we assume that the primitive vectors aand b have equal lengths and make an angle of 2π/5 = 72◦, as in Fig. 30-8(b),then there should also be an equivalent lattice point at D, at 72◦ from C. But the0 from E to D is then less than b, so b is not a primitive vector. There canvector bbe no ﬁvefold symmetry. The only possibilities that do not get us into this kindof diﬃculty are θ = 60◦, 90◦, or 120◦. Zero or 180◦ are also clearly possible. Oneway of stating our result is that the pattern can be left unchanged by a rotationof one full turn (no change at all), one-half of a turn, one-third, one-fourth, orone-sixth of a turn. And those are all the possible rotational symmetries in aplane—a total of ﬁve. If θ = 2π/n, we speak of an「n-fold」symmetry. We say30-5

(a) Rotational symmetriesgreaterthan sixfold are not possible.(b) Fivefold rotational symmetry is notpossible.

that a pattern with n equal to 4 or to 6 has a「higher symmetry」than one withn equal to 1 or to 2.

Returning to Fig. 30-7(a), we see that the pattern has a fourfold rotationalsymmetry. We have drawn in Fig. 30-7(b) another design which has the samesymmetry properties as part (a). The little comma-like ﬁgures are asymmetricobjects which serve to deﬁne the symmetry of the design inside of each square.Notice that the commas are reversed in alternate squares, so that the unit cell islarger than one of the small squares. If there were no commas, the pattern wouldstill have fourfold symmetry, but the unit cell would be smaller. The patterns ofFig. 30-7 also have other symmetry properties. For instance, a reﬂection aboutany of the broken lines R–R reproduces the same pattern.

The patterns of Fig. 30-7 have still another kind of symmetry. If the patternis reﬂected about the line Y –Y and shifted one square to the right (or left), weget back the original pattern. The line Y –Y is called a「glide」line.These are all the possible symmetries in two dimensions. There is one morespatial symmetry operation which is equivalent in two dimensions to a 180◦ rota-tion, but which is a quite distinct operation in three dimensions. It is inversion.By an inversion we mean that any point at the vector displacement R from someorigin [for instance, the point A in Fig. 30-9(b)] is moved to the point at −R.An inversion of pattern (a) of Fig. 30-9 produces a new pattern, but aninversion of pattern (b) reproduces the same pattern. For a two-dimensionalpattern (as you can see from the ﬁgure), an inversion of the pattern (b) throughthe point A is equivalent to a rotation of 180◦ about the same point. Suppose,however, we make the pattern in Fig. 30-9(b) three dimensional by imaginingthat the little 6’s and 9’s each have an「arrow」pointing out of the page. Afteran inversion in three dimensions all the arrows will be reversed, so the patternis not reproduced. If we indicate the heads and tails of the arrows by dots andcrosses, respectively, we can make a three-dimensional pattern, as in Fig. 30-9(c),which is not symmetric under an inversion, or we can make a pattern like theone shown in(d), which does have such a symmetry. Notice that it is not possibleto imitate a three-dimensional inversion by any combination of rotations.

If we characterize the「symmetry」of a pattern—or lattice—by the kinds ofsymmetry operations we have been describing, it turns out that for two dimensions17 distinct patterns are possible. We have drawn one pattern of the lowest possible30-6

symmetry in Fig. 30-1, and one of high symmetry in Fig. 30-7. We will leave youwith the game of trying to ﬁgure out all of the 17 possible patterns.

It is peculiar how few of the 17 possible patterns are used in making wallpaperand fabrics. One always sees the same three or four basic patterns. Is this becauseof a lack of imagination of designers, or because many of the possible patternsare not pleasing to the eye?

30-6 Symmetries in three dimensionsSo far we have talked only about patterns in two dimensions. What we arereally interested in, however, are patterns of atoms in three dimensions. First, it isclear that a three-dimensional crystal will have three primitive vectors. If we thenask about the possible symmetry operations in three dimensions, we ﬁnd thatthere are 230 diﬀerent possible symmetries! For some purposes, these 230 typescan be grouped into seven classes, which are drawn in Fig. 30-10. The lattice withthe least symmetry is called the triclinic. Its unit cell is a parallelepiped. Theprimitive vectors are of diﬀerent lengths, and no two of the angles between themare equal. There is no possibility of any rotational or reﬂection symmetry. Thereare, however, still two possible symmetries—the unit cell is, or is not, changed byan inversion through the vertex. (By an inversion in three dimensions, we againmean that spatial displacements R are replaced by −R—in other words, that(x, y, z) goes into (−x,−y,−z)). So the triclinic lattice has only two possiblesymmetries, unless there is some special relation among the primitive vectors.For example, if all the vectors are equal and are separated by equal angles, onehas the trigonal lattice shown in the ﬁgure. This ﬁgure can have an additionalsymmetry; it may be unchanged by a rotation about the long, body diagonal.If one of the primitive vectors, say c, is at right angles to the other two, we geta monoclinic unit cell. A new symmetry is possible—a rotation by 180◦ about c.The hexagonal cell is a special case in which the vectors a and b are equal andthe angle between them is 60◦, so that a rotation of 60◦, or 120◦, or 180◦ aboutthe vector c repeats the same lattice (for certain internal symmetries).If all three primitive vectors are at right angles, but of diﬀerent lengths, weget the orthorhombic cell. The ﬁgure is symmetric for rotations of 180◦ aboutthe three axes. Higher-order symmetries are possible with the tetragonal cell,which has all right angles and two equal primitive vectors. Finally, there is thecubic cell, which is the most symmetric of all.The point of all this discussion about symmetries is that the internal sym-metries of the crystals show up—sometimes in subtle ways—in the macroscopicphysical properties of the crystal. For instance, a crystal will, in general, have atensor electric polarizability. If we describe the tensor in terms of the ellipsoid ofpolarization, we should expect that some of the crystal symmetries should showup also in the ellipsoid. For example, a cubic crystal is symmetric with respectto a rotation of 90◦ about any one of three orthogonal directions. Clearly, theonly ellipsoid with this property is a sphere. A cubic crystal must be an isotropicdielectric.On the other hand, a tetragonal crystal has a fourfold rotational symmetry.Its ellipsoid must have two of its principal axes equal, and the third must beparallel to the axis of the crystal. Similarly, since the orthorhombic crystal hastwofold rotational symmetry about three orthogonal axes, its axes must coincidewith the axes of the polarization ellipsoid. In a like manner, one of the axes of amonoclinic crystal must be parallel to one of the principal axes of the ellipsoid,though we can’t say anything about the other axes. Since a triclinic crystal hasno rotational symmetry, the ellipsoid can have any orientation at all.

As you can see, we can make a big game of ﬁguring out the possible symmetriesand relating them to the possible physical tensors. We have considered only thepolarization tensor, but things get more complicated for others—for instance, forthe tensor of elasticity. There is a branch of mathematics called「group theory」that deals with such subjects, but usually you can ﬁgure out what you want withcommon sense.

lattices.

30-7 The strength of metalsWe have said that metals usually have a simple cubic crystal structure; wewant now to discuss their mechanical properties—which depend on this structure.Metals are, generally speaking, very「soft,」because it is easy to slide one layer ofthe crystal over the next. You may think:「That’s ridiculous; metals are strong.」Not so, a single crystal of a metal can be distorted very easily.Suppose we look at two layers of a crystal subjected to a shear force, as shownin the diagram of Fig. 30-11(a). You might at ﬁrst think the whole layer wouldresist motion until the force was big enough to push the whole layer「over thehump,」so that it shifted one notch to the left. Although slipping does occur alonga plane, it doesn’t happen that way. (If it did, you would calculate that the metalis much stronger than it really is.) What happens is more like one atom goingat a time; ﬁrst the atom on the left makes its jump, then the next, and so on, asindicated in Fig. 30-11(b). In eﬀect it is the vacant space between two atoms thatquickly travels to the right, with the net result that the whole second layer hasmoved over one atomic spacing. The slipping goes this way because it takes muchless energy to lift one atom at a time over the hump than to lift a whole row.Once the force is enough to start the process, it goes the rest of the way very fast.It turns out that in a real crystal, slipping will occur repeatedly at one plane,then will stop there and start at some other plane. The details of why it startsand stops are quite mysterious. It is, in fact, quite strange that successive regionsof slip are often fairly evenly spaced. Figure 30-12 shows a photograph of a tinythin copper crystal that has been stretched. You can see the various planes whereslipping has occurred.

The sudden slipping of individual crystal planes is quite apparent if you takea piece of tin wire that has large crystals in it and stretch it while holding itnext to your ear. You can hear a rush of「ticks」as the planes snap to their newpositions, one after the other.

The problem of having a「missing」atom in one row is somewhat more diﬃcultthan it might appear from Fig. 30-11. When there are more layers, the situationmust be something like that shown in Fig. 30-13. Such an imperfection in acrystal is called a dislocation. It is presumed that such dislocations are eitherpresent when the crystal was formed or are generated at some notch or crack atthe surface. Once they are produced, they can move relatively freely through thecrystal. The gross distortions result from the motions of many of such dislocations.Dislocations can move freely—that is, they require little extra energy—solong as the rest of the crystal has a perfect lattice. But they may get「stuck」if they encounter some other kind of imperfection in the crystal. If it takes alot of energy for them to pass the imperfection, they will be stopped. This isprecisely the mechanism that gives strength to imperfect metal crystals. Pureiron crystals are quite soft, but a small concentration of impurity atoms maycause enough imperfections to eﬀectively immobilize the dislocations. As youknow, steel, which is primarily iron, is very hard. To make steel, a small amountof carbon is dissolved in the iron melt; if the melt is cooled rapidly, the carbonprecipitates out in little grains, making many microscopic distortions in thelattice. The dislocations can no longer move about, and the metal is hard.

Pure copper is very soft, but can be「work-hardened.」This is done by ham-mering on it or bending it back and forth. In this case, many new dislocationsof various kinds are made which interfere with one another, cutting down their30-8

mobility. Perhaps you’ve seen the trick of taking a bar of「dead soft」copper andgently bending it around someone’s wrist as a bracelet. In the process, it becomeswork-hardened and cannot easily be unbent again! A work-hardened metal likecopper can be made soft again by annealing at a high temperature. The thermalmotion of the atoms「irons out」the dislocations and makes large single crystalsagain. We have, so far, described only the so-called slip dislocation. There aremany other kinds, one of which is the screw dislocation shown in Fig. 30-14.Such dislocations often play an important part in crystal growth.

30-8 Dislocations and crystal growthOne of the great puzzles for a long time was how crystals can possibly grow.We have described how it is that each atom might, by repeated testing, determinewhether it was better to be in the crystal or not. But that means that each atommust ﬁnd a place of low energy. However, an atom put on a new surface is onlybound by one or two bonds from below, and doesn’t have the same energy itwould have if it were placed in a corner, where it would have atoms on three sides.Suppose we imagine a growing crystal as a stack of blocks, as shown in Fig. 30-15.If we try a new block at, say, position A, it will have only one of the six neighborsit should ultimately get. With so many bonds lacking, its energy is not very low.It would be better oﬀ at position B, where it already has one-half of its quotaof bonds. Crystals do indeed grow by attaching new atoms at places like B.What happens, though, when that line is ﬁnished? To start a new line, anatom must come to rest with only two sides attached, and that is again not verylikely. Even if it did, what would happen when the layer was ﬁnished? Howcould a new layer get started? One answer is that the crystal prefers to growat a dislocation, for instance around a screw dislocation like the one shown inFig. 30-14. As blocks are added to this crystal, there is always some place wherethere are three available bonds. The crystal prefers, therefore, to grow with adislocation built in. Such a spiral pattern of growth is shown in Fig. 30-16, whichis a photograph of a single crystal of paraﬃn.

30-9 The Bragg-Nye crystal modelWe cannot, of course, see what goes on with the individual atoms in a crystal.Also, as you realize by now, there are many complicated phenomena that are noteasy to treat quantitatively. Sir Lawrence Bragg and J. F. Nye have devised ascheme for making a model of a metallic crystal which shows in a striking waymany of the phenomena that are believed to occur in a real metal. In the followingpages we have reproduced their original article, which describes their methodand shows some of the results they obtained with it.

The crystal structure of a metal is represented by an assemblageof bubbles, a millimetre or less in diameter, ﬂoating on the surfaceof a soap solution. The bubbles are blown from a ﬁne pipette be-neath the surface with a constant air pressure, and are remarkablyuniform in size. They are held together by surface tension, eitherin single layer on the surface or in a three-dimensional mass. Anassemblage may contain hundreds of thousands of bubbles and per-sists for an hour or more. The assemblages show structures whichhave been supposed to exist in metals, and simulate eﬀects whichhave been observed, such as, grain boundaries, dislocations andother types of fault, slip, recrystallization, annealing, and strainsdue to ‘foreign’ atoms.

1. The bubble model

Models of crystal structure have been described from time to timein which the atoms are represented by small ﬂoating or suspendedmagnets, or by circular disks ﬂoating on a water surface and heldtogether by the forces of capillary attraction. These models havecertain disadvantages; for instance, in the case of ﬂoating objects incontact, frictional forces impede their free relative movement. A moreserious disadvantage is that the number of components is limited,for a large number of components is required in order to approachthe state of aﬀairs in a real crystal. The present paper describes thebehaviour of a model in which the atoms are represented by smallbubbles from 2·0 to 0·1 mm. in diameter ﬂoating on the surface ofa soap solution. These small bubbles are suﬃciently persistent forexperiments lasting an hour or more, they slide past each other withoutfriction, and they can be produced in large numbers. Some of theillustrations in this paper were taken from assemblages of bubblesnumbering 100,000 or more. The model most nearly represents thebehaviour of a metal structure, because the bubbles are of one typeonly and are held together by a general capillary attraction, whichrepresents the binding force of the free electrons in the metal. A briefdescription of the model has been given in the Journal of ScientiﬁcInstruments (Bragg 1942b).

of pressure. Unwanted bubbles can easily be destroyed by playing asmall ﬂame over the surface. Figure 1 shows the apparatus. We havefound it of advantage to blacken the bottom of the vessel, becausedetails of structure, such as grain boundaries and dislocations, thenshow up more clearly.

Figure 2, plate 8, shows a portion of a raft or two-dimensionalcrystal of bubbles. Its regularity can be judged by looking at theﬁgure in a glancing direction. The size of the bubbles varies with theaperture, but does not appear to vary to any marked degree with thepressure or the depth of the oriﬁce beneath the surface. The maineﬀect of increasing the pressure is to increase the rate of issue of thebubbles. As an example, a thick-walled jet of 49 µ bore with a pressureof 100 cm. produced bubbles of 1·2 mm. in diameter. A thin-walledjet of 27 µ diameter and a pressure of 180 cm. produced bubbles of0·6 mm. diameter. It is convenient to refer to bubbles of 2·0 to 1·0 mm.diameter as ‘large’ bubbles, those from 0·8 to 0·6 mm. diameter as‘medium’ bubbles, and those from 0·3 to 0·1 mm. diameter as ‘small’bubbles, since their behaviour varies with their size.With this apparatus we have not found it possible to reduce the sizeof the jet and so produce bubbles of smaller diameter than 0·6 mm. Asit was desired to experiment with very small bubbles, we had recourseto placing the soap solution in a rotating vessel and introducing a ﬁnejet as nearly as possible parallel to a stream line. The bubbles areswept away as they form, and under steady conditions are reasonablyuniform. They issue at a rate of one thousand or more per second,giving a high-pitched note. The soap solution mounts up in a steepwall around the perimeter of the vessel while it is rotating, but carriesback most of the bubbles with it when rotation ceases. With thisdevice, illustrated in ﬁgure 3, bubbles down to 0·12 mm. in diametercan be obtained. As an example, an oriﬁce 38 µ across in a thin-walledjet, with a pressure of 190 cm. of water, and a speed of the ﬂuid of180 cm./sec. past the oriﬁce, produced bubbles of 0·14 mm. diameter.In this case a dish of diameter 9·5 cm. and speed of 6 rev./sec. wasused. Figure 4, plate 8, is an enlarged picture of these ‘small’ bubblesand shows their degree of regularity; the pattern is not as perfectwith a rotating as with a stationary vessel, the rows being seen to beslightly irregular when viewed in a glancing direction.

These two-dimensional crystals show structures which have beensupposed to exist in metals, and simulate eﬀects which have beenobserved, such as grain boundaries, dislocations and other types offault, slip, recrystallization, annealing, and strains due to ‘foreign’atoms.

2. Method of formation

The bubbles are blown from a ﬁne oriﬁce, beneath the surfaceof a soap solution. We have had the best results with a solution theformula of which was given to us by Mr Green of the Royal Institution.15·2 c.c. of oleic acid (pure redistilled) is well shaken in 50 c.c. ofdistilled water. This is mixed thoroughly with 73 c.c. of 10 % solutionof tri-ethanolamine and the mixture made up to 200 c.c. To this isadded 164 c.c. of pure glycerine. It is left to stand and the clear liquidis drawn oﬀ from below. In some experiments this was diluted in threetimes its volume of water to reduce viscosity. The oriﬁce of the jet isabout 5 mm. below the surface. A constant air pressure of 50 to 200 cm.of water is supplied by means of two Winchester ﬂasks. Normally thebubbles are remarkably uniform in size. Occasionally they issue inan irregular manner, but this can be corrected by a change of jet or

3. Grain boundaries

Figures 5a, 5b and 5c, plates 9 and 10, show typical grain bound-aries for bubbles of 1·87, 0·76 and 0·30 mm. diameter respectively.The width of the disturbed area at the boundary, where the bubbleshave an irregular distribution, is in general greater the smaller thebubbles. In ﬁgure 5a, which shows portions of several adjacent grains,bubbles at a boundary between two grains adhere deﬁnitely to onecrystalline arrangement or the other. In ﬁgure 5c there is a marked‘Beilby layer’ between the two grains. The small bubbles, as will beseen, have a greater rigidity than the large ones, and this appears togive rise to more irregularity at the interface.

Separate grains show up distinctly when photographs of polycrys-talline rafts such as ﬁgures 5a to 5c, plates 9 and 10, and ﬁgures 12ato 12e, plates 14 to 16, are viewed obliquely. With suitable lighting,the ﬂoating raft of bubbles itself when viewed obliquely resembles apolished and etched metal in a remarkable way.

30-10

It often happens that some ‘impurity atoms’, or bubbles whichare markedly larger or smaller than the average, are found in a poly-crystalline raft, and when this is so a large proportion of them aresituated at the grain boundaries. It would be incorrect to say thatthe irregular bubbles make their way to the boundaries; it is a defectof the model that no diﬀusion of bubbles through the structure cantake place, mutual adjustments of neighbours alone being possible.It appears that the boundaries tend to readjust themselves by thegrowth of one crystal at the expense of another till they pass throughthe irregular atoms.

4. Dislocations

When a single crystal or polycrystalline raft is compressed, ex-tended, or otherwise deformed it exhibits a behaviour very similarto that which has been pictured for metals subjected to strain. Upto a certain limit the model is within its elastic range. Beyond thatpoint it yields by slip along one of the three equally inclined directionsof closely packed rows. Slip takes place by the bubbles in one rowmoving forward over those in the next row by an amount equal tothe distance between neighbours. It is very interesting to watch thisprocess taking place. The movement is not simultaneous along thewhole row but begins at one end with the appearance of a ‘dislocation’,where there is locally one more bubble in the rows on one side ofthe slip line as compared with those on the other. This dislocationthen runs along the slip line from one side of the crystal to the other,the ﬁnal result being a slip by one ‘inter-atomic’ distance. Such aprocess has been invoked by Orowan, by Polanyi and by Taylor toexplain the small forces required to produce plastic gliding in metalstructures. The theory put forward by Taylor (1934) to explain themechanism of plastic deformation of crystals considers the mutualaction and equilibrium of such dislocations. The bubbles aﬀord a verystriking picture of what has been supposed to take place in the metal.Sometimes the dislocations run along quite slowly, taking a matter ofseconds to cross a crystal; stationary dislocations also are to be seenin crystals which are not homogeneously strained. They appear asshort black lines, and can be seen in the series of photographs, ﬁgures12a to 12e, plates 14 to 16. When a polycrystalline raft is compressed,these dark lines are seen to be dashing about in all directions acrossthe crystals.Figures 6a, 6b and 6c, plates 10 and 11, show examples of disloca-tions. In ﬁgure 6a, where the diameter of the bubbles is 1·9 mm., thedislocation is very local, extending over about six bubbles. In ﬁgure 6b(diameter 0·76 mm.) it extends over twelve bubbles, and in ﬁgure 6c(diameter 0·30 mm.) its inﬂuence can be traced for a length of aboutﬁfty bubbles. The greater rigidity of the small bubbles leads to longerdislocations. The study of any mass of bubbles shows, however, thatthere is not a standard length of dislocation for each size. The lengthdepends upon the nature of the strain in the crystal. A boundarybetween two crystals with corresponding axes at approximately 30◦(the maximum angle which can occur) may be regarded as a series ofdislocations in alternate rows, and in this case the dislocations arevery short. As the angle between the neighbouring crystals decreases,the dislocations occur at wider intervals and at the same time becomelonger, till one ﬁnally has single dislocations in a large body of perfectstructure as shown in ﬁgures 6a, 6b and 6c.

Figure 7, plate 11, shows three parallel dislocations. If we call thempositive and negative (following Taylor) they are positive, negative,positive, reading from left to right. The strip between the last two hasthree bubbles in excess, as can be seen by looking along the rows in ahorizontal direction. Figure 8, plate 12, shows a dislocation projectingfrom a grain boundary, an eﬀect often observed.

Figure 9, plate 12, shows a place where two bubbles take theplace of one. This may be regarded as a limiting case of positive andnegative dislocations on neighbouring rows, with the compressive sidesof the dislocations facing each other. The contrary case would lead toa hole in the structure, one bubble being missing at the point wherethe dislocations met.

5. Other types of fault

Figure 10, plate 12, shows a narrow strip between two crystals ofparallel orientation, the strip being crossed by a number of fault lineswhere the bubbles are not in close packing. It is in such places as these

30-11

that recrystallization may be expected. The boundaries approach andthe strip is absorbed into a wider area of perfect crystal.

Figures 11a to 11g, plates 13 and 14 are examples of arrangementswhich frequently appear in places where there is a local deﬁciency ofbubbles. While a dislocation is seen as a dark stripe in a general view,these structures show up in the shape of the letter V or as triangles.A typical V structure is seen in ﬁgure 11a. When the model is beingdistorted, a V structure is formed by two dislocations meeting at aninclination of 60◦; it is destroyed by the dislocations continuing alongtheir paths. Figure 11b shows a small triangle, which also embodies adislocation, for it will be noticed that the rows below the fault haveone more bubble than these below. If a mild amount of ‘thermalmovement’ is imposed by gentle agitation of one side of the crystal,such faulty places disappear and a perfect structure is formed.

Here and there in the crystals there is a blank space where a bubbleis missing, showing as a black dot in a general view. Examples occurin ﬁgure 11g. Such a gap cannot be closed by a local readjustment,since ﬁlling the hole causes another to appear. Such holes both appearand disappear when the crystal is ‘cold-worked’. These structuresin the model suggest that similar local faults may exist in an actualmetal. They may play a part in processes such as diﬀusion or the order-disorder change by reducing energy barriers in their neighbourhood,and act as nuclei for crystallization in an allotropic change.

6. Recrystallization and annealing

Figures 12a to 12e, plates 14 to 16, show the same raft of bubblesat successive times. A raft covering the surface of the solution wasgiven a vigorous stirring with a glass rake, and then left to adjustitself. Figure 12a shows its aspect about 1 sec. after stirring has ceased.The raft is broken into a number of small ‘crystallites’; these are in ahigh state of non-homogeneous strain as is shown by the numerousdislocations and other faults. The following photograph (ﬁgure 12b)shows the same raft 32 sec. later. The small grains have coalescedto form larger grains, and much of the strain has disappeared in theprocess. Recrystallization takes place right through the series, thelast three photographs of which show the appearance of the raft 2, 14and 25 min. after the initial stirring. It is not possible to follow therearrangement for much longer times, because the bubbles shrink afterlong standing, apparently due to the diﬀusion of air through theirwalls, and they also become thin and tend to burst. No agitationwas given to the model during this process. An ever slower processof rearrangement goes on, the movement of the bubbles in one partof the raft setting up strains which activate a rearrangement in aneighbouring part, and that in its turn still another.

A number of interesting points are to be seen in this series. Notethe three small grains at the points indicated by the co-ordinates AA,BB, CC. A persists, though changed in form, throughout the wholeseries. B is still present after 14 min., but has disappeared in 25 min.,leaving behind it four dislocations marking internal strain in the grain.Grain C shrinks and ﬁnally disappears in ﬁgure 12d, leaving a holeand a V which has disappeared in ﬁgure 12e. At the same time theill-deﬁned boundary in ﬁgure 12d at DD has become a deﬁnite one inﬁgure 12e. Note also the straightening out of the grain boundary inthe neighbourhood of EE in ﬁgures 12b to 12e. Dislocations of variouslengths can be seen, marking all stages between a slight warping of thestructure and a deﬁnite boundary. Holes where bubbles are missingshow up as black dots. Some of these holes are formed or ﬁlled up bymovements of dislocations, but others represent places where a bubblehas burst. Many examples of V’s and some of triangles can be seen.Other interesting points will be apparent from a study of this seriesof photographs.

Figures 13a, 13b and 13c, plate 17, show a portion of a raft1 sec., 4 sec. and 4 min. after the stirring process, and is interestingas showing two successive stages in the relaxation towards a moreperfect arrangement. The changes show up well when one looks in aglancing direction across the page. The arrangement is very broken inﬁgure 13a. In ﬁgure 13b the bubbles have grouped themselves in rows,but the curvature of these rows indicates a high degree of internalstrain. In ﬁgure 13c this strain has been relieved by the formation ofa new boundary at A–A, the rows on either side now being straight.It would appear that the energy of this strained crystal is greaterthan that of the intercrystalline boundary. We are indebted to MessrsKodak for the photographs of ﬁgure 13, which were taken when thecinematograph ﬁlm referred to below was produced.

boundaries when single crystal and polycrystalline rafts are sheared,compressed, or extended. Moreover, if the soap solution is placed in aglass vessel with a ﬂat bottom, the model lends itself to projection ona large scale by transmitted light. Since a certain depth is requiredfor producing the bubbles, and the solution is rather opaque, it isdesirable to make the projection through a glass block resting on thebottom of the vessel and just submerged beneath the surface.

In conclusion, we wish to express our thanks to Mr C. E. Harrold,of King’s College, Cambridge, who made for us some of the pipetteswhich were used to produce the bubbles.

7. Effect of impurity atom

Figure 14, plate 18, shows the widespread eﬀect of a bubble whichis of the wrong size. If this ﬁgure is compared with the perfect raftsshown in ﬁgures 2 and 4, plate 8, it will be seen that three bubbles, onelarger and two smaller than normal, disturb the regularity of the rowsover the whole of the ﬁgure. As has been mentioned above, bubblesof the wrong size are generally found in the grain boundaries, whereholes of irregular size occur which can accommodate them.

8. Mechanical properties of the two-dimensional modelThe mechanical properties of a two-dimensional perfect raft havebeen described in the paper referred to above (Bragg 1942b). The raftlies between two parallel springs dipping horizontally in the surfaceof the soap solution. The pitch of the springs is adjusted to ﬁt thespacing of the rows of bubbles, which then adhere ﬁrmly to them. Onespring can be translated parallel to itself by a micrometer screw, andthe other is supported by two thin vertical glass ﬁbres. The shearingstress can be measured by noting the deﬂexion of the glass ﬁbres.When subjected to a shearing strain, the raft obeys Hooke’s law ofelasticity up to the point where the elastic limit is reached. It thenslips along some intermediate row by an amount equal to the width ofone bubble. The elastic shear and slip can be repeated several times.The elastic limit is approximately reached when one side of the rafthas been sheared by an amount equal to a bubble width past the otherside. This feature supports the basic assumption made by one of us inthe calculation of the elastic limit of a metal (Bragg 1942a), in whichit is supposed that each crystallite in a cold-worked metal only yieldswhen the strain in it has reached such a value that energy is releasedby the slip.

A calculation has been made by M. M. Nicolson of the forcesbetween the bubbles, and will be published shortly. It shows twointeresting points. The curve for the variation of potential energywith distance between centres is very similar to those which havebeen plotted for atoms. It has a minimum for a distance betweencentres slightly less than a free bubble diameter, and rises sharplyfor smaller distances. Further, the rise is extremely sharp for bubblesof 0·1 mm. diameter but much less so for bubbles of 1 mm. diameter,thus conﬁrming the impression given by the model that the smallbubbles behave as if they were much more rigid than the large ones.

9. Three-dimensional assemblages

If the bubbles are allowed to accumulate in multiple layers on thesurface, they form a mass of three-dimensional ‘crystals’ with one ofthe arrangements of closest packing. Figure 15, plate 18, shows anoblique view of such a mass; its resemblance to a polished and etchedmetal surface is noticeable. In ﬁgure 16, plate 20, a similar mass isseen viewed normally. Parts of the structure are deﬁnitely in cubicclosest packing, the outer surface being the (111) face or (100) face.Figure 17a, plate 19, shows a (111) face. The outlines of the threebubbles on which each upper bubble rests can be clearly seen, and thenext layer of these bubbles is faintly visible in a position not beneaththe uppermost layer, showing that the packing of the (111) planeshas the well-known cubic succession. Figure 17b, plate 19, shows a(100) face with each bubble resting on four others. The cubic axesare of course inclined at 45◦ to the close-packed rows of the surfacelayer. Figure 17c, plate 19, shows a twin in the cubic structure acrossthe face (111). The uppermost faces are (111) and (100), and theymake a small angle with each other, though this is not apparent in theﬁgure; it shows up in an oblique view. Figure 17d, plate 19, appearsto show both the cubic and hexagonal succession of closely packedplanes, but it is diﬃcult to verify whether the left-hand side followsthe true hexagonal close-packed structure because it is not certainthat the assemblage had a depth of more than two layers at this point.Many instances of twins, and of intercrystalline boundaries, can beseen in ﬁgure 16, plate 20.

sional structure subjected to a bending strain.

31-1 The tensor of polarizabilityPhysicists

always have a habit of taking the simplest example of any phe-nomenon and calling it「physics,」leaving the more complicated examples tobecome the concern of other ﬁelds—say of applied mathematics, electrical engi-neering, chemistry, or crystallography. Even solid-state physics is almost only halfphysics because it worries too much about special substances. So in these lectureswe will be leaving out many interesting things. For instance, one of the importantproperties of crystals—or of most substances—is that their electric polarizabilityis diﬀerent in diﬀerent directions. If you apply a ﬁeld in any direction, the atomiccharges shift a little and produce a dipole moment, but the magnitude of themoment depends very much on the direction of the ﬁeld. That is, of course, quitea complication. But in physics we usually start out by talking about the specialcase in which the polarizability is the same in all directions, to make life easier.We leave the other cases to some other ﬁeld. Therefore, for our later work, wewill not need at all what we are going to talk about in this chapter.

The mathematics of tensors is particularly useful for describing properties ofsubstances which vary in direction—although that’s only one example of their use.Since most of you are not going to become physicists, but are going to go into thereal world, where things depend severely upon direction, sooner or later you willneed to use tensors. In order not to leave anything out, we are going to describetensors, although not in great detail. We want the feeling that our treatment ofphysics is complete. For example, our electrodynamics is complete—as completeas any electricity and magnetism course, even a graduate course. Our mechanicsis not complete, because we studied mechanics when you didn’t have a high levelof mathematical sophistication, and we were not able to discuss subjects like theprinciple of least action, or Lagrangians, or Hamiltonians, and so on, which aremore elegant ways of describing mechanics. Except for general relativity, however,we do have the complete laws of mechanics. Our electricity and magnetism iscomplete, and a lot of other things are quite complete. The quantum mechanics,naturally, will not be—we have to leave something for the future. But you shouldat least know what a tensor is.

We emphasized in Chapter 30 that the properties of crystalline substancesare diﬀerent in diﬀerent directions—we say they are anisotropic. The variationof the induced dipole moment with the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld isonly one example, the one we will use for our example of a tensor. Let’s saythat for a given direction of the electric ﬁeld the induced dipole moment perunit volume P is proportional to the strength of the applied ﬁeld E. (This isa good approximation for many substances if E is not too large.) We will callthe proportionality constant α.* We want now to consider substances in whichα depends on the direction of the applied ﬁeld, as, for example, in crystals likecalcite, which make double images when you look through them.Suppose, in a particular crystal, we ﬁnd that an electric ﬁeld E1 in thex-direction produces the polarization P 1 in the x-direction. Then we ﬁnd thatan electric ﬁeld E2 in the y-direction, with the same strength, as E1 produces adiﬀerent polarization P 2 in the y-direction. What would happen if we put an* In Chapter 10 we followed the usual convention and wrote P = 0χE and called χ (「khi」)the「susceptibility.」Here, it will be more convenient to use a single letter, so we write α for 0χ.For isotropic dielectrics, α = (κ − 1)0, where κ is the dielectric constant (see Section 10-4).

electric ﬁeld at 45◦? Well, that’s a superposition of two ﬁelds along x and y, sothe polarization P will be the vector sum of P 1 and P 2, as shown in Fig. 31-1(a).The polarization is no longer in the same direction as the electric ﬁeld. You cansee how that might come about. There may be charges which can move easilyup and down, but which are rather stiﬀ for sidewise motions. When a force isapplied at 45◦, the charges move farther up than they do toward the side. Thedisplacements are not in the direction of the external force, because there areasymmetric internal elastic forces.

There is, of course, nothing special about 45◦. It is generally true that theinduced polarization of a crystal is not in the direction of the electric ﬁeld. In ourexample above, we happened to make a「lucky」choice of our x- and y-axes, forwhich P was along E for both the x- and y-directions. If the crystal were rotatedwith respect to the coordinate axes, the electric ﬁeld E2 in the y-direction wouldhave produced a polarization P with both an x- and a y-component. Similarly,the polarization due to an electric ﬁeld in the x-direction would have produced apolarization with an x-component and a y-component. Then the polarizationswould be as shown in Fig. 31-1(b), instead of as in part (a). Things get morecomplicated—but for any ﬁeld E, the magnitude of P is still proportional to themagnitude of E.

We want now to treat the general case of an arbitrary orientation of a crystalwith respect to the coordinate axes. An electric ﬁeld in the x-direction willproduce a polarization P with x-, y-, and z-components; we can write

Px = αxxEx,

Py = αyxEx,

Pz = αzxEx.

(31.1)

All we are saying here is that if the electric ﬁeld is in the x-direction, thepolarization does not have to be in that same direction, but rather has an x-, ay-, and a z-component—each proportional to Ex. We are calling the constants ofproportionality αxx, αyx, and αzx, respectively (the ﬁrst letter to tell us whichcomponent of P is involved, the last to refer to the direction of the electric ﬁeld).

Similarly, for a ﬁeld in the y-direction, we can write

Px = αxyEy,

Py = αyyEy,

Pz = αzyEy;

(31.2)

and for a ﬁeld in the z-direction,

Px = αxzEz,

Py = αyzEz,

Pz = αzzEz.

(31.3)

Fig. 31-1. The vector addition of polar-

izations in an anisotropic crystal.

Now we have said that polarization depends linearly on the ﬁelds, so if thereis an electric ﬁeld E that has both an x- and a y-component, the resultingx-component of P will be the sum of the two Px’s of Eqs. (31.1) and (31.2). IfE has components along x, y, and z, the resulting components of P will be thesum of the three contributions in Eqs. (31.1), (31.2), and (31.3). In other words,P will be given by

Px = αxxEx + αxyEy + αxzEz,Py = αyxEx + αyyEy + αyz Ez,Pz = αzxEx + αzy Ey + αzz Ez.

(31.4)

The dielectric behavior of the crystal is then completely described by the ninequantities (αxx, αxy, αxz, αyx, . . . ), which we can represent by the symbol αij.(The subscripts i and j each stand for any one of the three possible letters x, y,and z.) Any arbitrary electric ﬁeld E can be resolved with the componentsEx, Ey, and Ez; from these we can use the αij to ﬁnd Px, Py, and Pz, whichtogether give the total polarization P . The set of nine coeﬃcients αij is called atensor—in this instance, the tensor of polarizability. Just as we say that the threenumbers (Ex, Ey, Ez)「form the vector E,」we say that the nine numbers (αxx,αxy, . . . )「form the tensor αij.」

31-2 Transforming the tensor componentsYou know that when we change to a diﬀerent coordinate system x0, y0, and z0,the components Ex0, Ey0, and Ez0 of the vector will be quite diﬀerent—as willalso the components of P . So all the coeﬃcients αij will be diﬀerent for adiﬀerent set of coordinates. You can, in fact, see how the α’s must be changed bychanging the components of E and P in the proper way, because if we describethe same physical electric ﬁeld in the new coordinate system we should get thesame polarization. For any new set of coordinates, Px0 is a linear combination ofPx, Py, and Pz:

Px0 = aPx + bPy + cPz,

and similarly for the other components. If you substitute for Px, Py, and Pz interms of the E’s, using Eq. (31.4), you get

Px0 = a(αxxEx + αxyEy + αxzEz)+ b(αyxEx + αyyEy + αyz Ez)+ c(αzxEx + αzy Ey + αzz Ez).

Then you write Ex, Ey, and Ez in terms of Ex0, Ey0, and Ez0; for instance,

Ex = a0Ex0 + b0Ey0 + c0Ez0,

where a0, b0, c0 are related to, but not equal to, a, b, c. So you have Px0, expressedin terms of the components Ex0, Ey0, and Ez0; that is, you have the new αij. Itis fairly messy, but quite straightforward.When we talk about changing the axes we are assuming that the crystalstays put in space. If the crystal were rotated with the axes, the α’s would notchange. Conversely, if the orientation of the crystal were changed with respectto the axes, we would have a new set of α’s. But if they are known for any oneorientation of the crystal, they can be found for any other orientation by thetransformation we have just described. In other words, the dielectric property ofa crystal is described completely by giving the components of the polarizationtensor αij with respect to any arbitrarily chosen set of axes. Just as we canassociate a vector velocity v = (vx, vy, vz) with a particle, knowing that the threecomponents will change in a certain deﬁnite way if we change our coordinate axes,so with a crystal we associate its polarization tensor αij, whose nine componentswill transform in a certain deﬁnite way if the coordinate system is changed.The relation between P and E written in Eq. (31.4) can be put in the more

compact notation:

αijEj,

(31.5)

Pi =X

j

where it is understood that i represents either x, y, or z and that the sum istaken on j = x, y, and z. Many special notations have been invented for dealingwith tensors, but each of them is convenient only for a limited class of problems.

One common convention is to omit the sum sign (P) in Eq. (31.5), leaving it

understood that whenever the same subscript occurs twice (here j), a sum is tobe taken over that index. Since we will be using tensors so little, we will notbother to adopt any such special notations or conventions.

31-3 The energy ellipsoidWe want now to get some experience with tensors. Suppose we ask theinteresting question: What energy is required to polarize the crystal (in additionto the energy in the electric ﬁeld which we know is 0E2/2 per unit volume)?Consider for a moment the atomic charges that are being displaced. The workdone in displacing the charge the distance dx is qEx dx, and if there are N chargesper unit volume, the work done is qExN dx. But qN dx is the change dPx in thedipole moment per unit volume. So the energy required per unit volume is

Ex dPx.

(31.7)

Combining the work for the three components of the ﬁeld, the work per unitvolume is found to be

E · dP .

Since the magnitude of P is proportional to E, the work done per unit volumein bringing the polarization from 0 to P is the integral of E · dP . Calling thiswork uP ,* we write

Now we can express P in terms of E by Eq. (31.5), and we have that

uP = 12

The energy density uP is a number independent of the choice of axes, so it is ascalar. A tensor has then the property that when it is summed over one index(with a vector), it gives a new vector; and when it is summed over both indexes(with two vectors), it gives a scalar.The tensor αij should really be called a「tensor of second rank,」because ithas two indexes. A vector—with one index—is a tensor of the ﬁrst rank, anda scalar—with no index—is a tensor of zero rank. So we say that the electricﬁeld E is a tensor of the ﬁrst rank and that the energy density uP is a tensor ofzero rank. It is possible to extend the ideas of a tensor to three or more indexes,and so to make tensors of ranks higher than two.

The subscripts of the polarization tensor range over three possible values—they are tensors in three dimensions. The mathematicians consider tensors in four,ﬁve, or more dimensions. We have already used a four-dimensional tensor Fµν inour relativistic description of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (Chapter 26).The polarization tensor αij has the interesting property that it is symmetric,that is, that αxy = αyx, and so on for any pair of indexes. (This is a physicalproperty of a real crystal and not necessary for all tensors.) You can prove foryourself that this must be true by computing the change in energy of a crystalthrough the following cycle: (1) Turn on a ﬁeld in the x-direction; (2) turn ona ﬁeld in the y-direction; (3) turn oﬀ the x-ﬁeld; (4) turn oﬀ the y-ﬁeld. Thecrystal is now back where it started, and the net work done on the polarizationmust be back to zero. You can show, however, that for this to be true, αxy mustbe equal to αyx. The same kind of argument can, of course, be given for αxz,etc. So the polarization tensor is symmetric.This also means that the polarization tensor can be measured by just measuringthe energy required to polarize the crystal in various directions. Suppose we applyan E-ﬁeld with only an x- and a y-component; then according to Eq. (31.7),

uP = 1

2[αxxE2

+ (αxy + αyx)ExEy + αyyE2

(31.8)With an Ex alone, we can determine αxx; with an Ey alone, we can determine αyy;with both Ex and Ey, we get an extra energy due to the term with (αxy + αyx).Since the αxy and αyx are equal, this term is 2αxy and can be related to theenergy.The energy expression, Eq. (31.8), has a nice geometric interpretation. Sup-pose we ask what ﬁelds Ex and Ey correspond to some given energy density—say u0. That is just the mathematical problem of solving the equation

αxxE2

x

+ 2αxyExEy + αyyE2

= 2u0.

This is a quadratic equation, so if we plot Ex and Ey the solutions of this equationare all the points on an ellipse (Fig. 31-2). (It must be an ellipse, rather thana parabola or a hyperbola, because the energy for any ﬁeld is always positiveand ﬁnite.) The vector E with components Ex and Ey can be drawn from the* This work done in producing the polarization by an electric ﬁeld is not to be confused

origin to the ellipse. So such an「energy ellipse」is a nice way of「visualizing」thepolarization tensor.

If we now generalize to include all three components, the electric vector E inany direction required to give a unit energy density gives a point which will beon the surface of an ellipsoid, as shown in Fig. 31-3. The shape of this ellipsoidof constant energy uniquely characterizes the tensor polarizability.

Now an ellipsoid has the nice property that it can always be described simplyby giving the directions of three「principal axes」and the diameters of the ellipsealong these axes. The「principal axes」are the directions of the longest andshortest diameters and the direction at right angles to both. They are indicatedby the axes a, b, and c in Fig. 31-3. With respect to these axes, the ellipsoid hasthe particularly simple equation

αaaE2

a

+ αbbE2

b

+ αccE2

c

= 2u0.

So with respect to these axes, the dielectric tensor has only three componentsthat are not zero: αaa, αbb, and αcc. That is to say, no matter how complicated acrystal is, it is always possible to choose a set of axes (not necessarily the crystalaxes) for which the polarization tensor has only three components. With such aset of axes, Eq. (31.4) becomes simply

Pa = αaaEa,

Pb = αbbEb,

Pc = αccEc.

(31.9)

Fig. 31-2. Locus of the vector E =(Ex , Ey ) that gives a constant energy ofpolarization.

An electric ﬁeld along any one of the principal axes produces a polarization alongthe same axis, but the coeﬃcients for the three axes may, of course, be diﬀerent.Often, a tensor is described by listing the nine coeﬃcients in a table inside of

a pair of brackets:

For the principal axes a, b, and c, only the diagonal terms are not zero; we saythen that「the tensor is diagonal.」The complete tensor is

The important point is that any polarization tensor (in fact, any symmetrictensor of rank two in any number of dimensions) can be put in this form bychoosing a suitable set of coordinate axes.

If the three elements of the polarization tensor in diagonal form are all equal,

that is, if

(31.12)the energy ellipsoid becomes a sphere, and the polarizability is the same in alldirections. The material is isotropic. In the tensor notation,

The tensor δij is often called the「Kronecker delta.」You may amuse yourselfby proving that the tensor (31.14) has exactly the same form if you change31-5

The shape and orientation of the polarization ellipsoid can sometimes berelated to the symmetry properties of the crystal. We have said in Chapter 30 thatthere are 230 diﬀerent possible internal symmetries of a three-dimensional latticeand that they can, for many purposes, be conveniently grouped into seven classes,according to the shape of the unit cell. Now the ellipsoid of polarizability mustshare the internal geometric symmetries of the crystal. For example, a tricliniccrystal has low symmetry—the ellipsoid of polarizability will have unequal axes,and its orientation will not, in general, be aligned with the crystal axes. Onthe other hand, a monoclinic crystal has the property that its properties areunchanged if the crystal is rotated 180◦ about one axis. So the polarizationtensor must be the same after such a rotation. It follows that the ellipsoid ofthe polarizability must return to itself after a 180◦ rotation. That can happenonly if one of the axes of the ellipsoid is in the same direction as the symmetryaxis of the crystal. Otherwise, the orientation and dimensions of the ellipsoid areunrestricted.

For an orthorhombic crystal, however, the axes of the ellipsoid must correspondto the crystal axes, because a 180◦ rotation about any one of the three axesrepeats the same lattice. If we go to a tetragonal crystal, the ellipse must havethe same symmetry, so it must have two equal diameters. Finally, for a cubiccrystal, all three diameters of the ellipsoid must be equal; it becomes a sphere,and the polarizability of the crystal is the same in all directions.

There is a big game of ﬁguring out the possible kinds of tensors for all thepossible symmetries of a crystal. It is called a「group-theoretical」analysis. Butfor the simple case of the polarizability tensor, it is relatively easy to see whatthe relations must be.

31-4 Other tensors; the tensor of inertiaThere are many other examples of tensors appearing in physics. For example,in a metal, or in any conductor, one often ﬁnds that the current density j isapproximately proportional to the electric ﬁeld E; the proportionality constantis called the conductivity σ:

j = σE.

For crystals, however, the relation between j and E is more complicated; theconductivity is not the same in all directions. The conductivity is a tensor, andwe write

ji =X

σijEj.

Another example of a physical tensor is the moment of inertia. In Chapter 18of Volume I we saw that a solid object rotating about a ﬁxed axis has anangular momentum L proportional to the angular velocity ω, and we called theproportionality factor I, the moment of inertia:

L = Iω.

For an arbitrarily shaped object, the moment of inertia depends on its orientationwith respect to the axis of rotation. For instance, a rectangular block will havediﬀerent moments about each of its three orthogonal axes. Now angular velocity ωand angular momentum L are both vectors. For rotations about one of the axesof symmetry, they are parallel. But if the moment of inertia is diﬀerent for thethree principal axes, then ω and L are, in general, not in the same direction31-6

(see Fig. 31-4). They are related in a way analogous to the relation between Eand P . In general, we must write

Lx = Ixxωx + Ixyωy + Ixzωz,Ly = Iyxωx + Iyyωy + Iyz ωz,Lz = Izxωx + Izy ωy + Izz ωz.

(31.16)

The nine coeﬃcients Iij are called the tensor of inertia. Following the analogywith the polarization, the kinetic energy for any angular momentum must besome quadratic form in the components ωx, ωy, and ωz:

(31.17)

Fig. 31-4. The angular momentum L ofa solid object is not, in general, parallel toits angular velocity ω.

We can use the energy to deﬁne the ellipsoid of inertia. Also, energy argumentscan be used to show that the tensor is symmetric—that Iij = Iji.The tensor of inertia for a rigid body can be worked out if the shape of theobject is known. We need only to write down the total kinetic energy of allthe particles in the body. A particle of mass m and velocity v has the kineticenergy 1

2 mv2, and the total kinetic energy is just the sum

X 1

2 mv2

over all of the particles of the body. The velocity v of each particle is related tothe angular velocity ω of the solid body. Let’s assume that the body is rotatingabout its center of mass, which we take to be at rest. Then if r is the displacementof a particle from the center of mass, its velocity v is given by ω × r. So thetotal kinetic energy is

2 m(ω × r)2.

(31.18)Now all we have to do is write ω × r out in terms of the components ωx, ωy, ωz,and x, y, z, and compare the result with Eq. (31.17); we ﬁnd Iij by identifyingterms. Carrying out the algebra, we write+ (ω × r)2

Multiplying this equation by m/2, summing over all particles, and comparingwith Eq. (31.17), we see that Ixx, for instance, is given by

This is the formula we have had before (Chapter 19, Vol. I) for the moment ofinertia of a body about the x-axis. Since r2 = x2 + y2 + z2, we can also writethis term as

m(y2 + z2).

For a body of any shape whatever, we can ﬁnd the ellipsoid of inertia and,therefore, the three principal axes. Referred to these axes, the tensor will bediagonal, so for any object there are always three orthogonal axes for whichthe angular velocity and angular momentum are parallel. They are called theprincipal axes of inertia.

31-5 The cross productWe should point out that we have been using tensors of the second rank sinceChapter 20 of Volume I. There, we deﬁned a「torque in a plane,」such as τxy by

τxy = xFy − yFx.Generalized to three dimensions, we could writeτij = riFj − rjFi.

(31.22)The quantity τij is a tensor of the second rank. One way to see that this is so isby combining τij with some vector, say the unit vector e, according to

X

j

τijej.

If this quantity is a vector, then τij must transform as a tensor—this is ourdeﬁnition of a tensor. Substituting for τij, we have

X

τijej =X

riFjej −X

j

j

j

= ri(F · e) − (r · e)Fi.

Since the dot products are scalars, the two terms on the right-hand side arevectors, and likewise their diﬀerence. So τij is a tensor.

But τij is a special kind of tensor; it is antisymmetric, that is,

τij = −τji,

so it has only three nonzero terms—τxy, τyz, and τzx. We were able to show inChapter 20 of Volume I that these three terms, almost「by accident,」transformlike the three components of a vector, so that we could deﬁne

τ = (τx, τy, τz) = (τyz, τzx, τxy)

We say「by accident,」because it happens only in three dimensions. In fourdimensions, for instance, an antisymmetric tensor of the second rank has upto six nonzero terms and certainly cannot be replaced by a vector with fourcomponents.Just as the axial vector τ = r × F is a tensor, so also is every cross productof two polar vectors—all the same arguments apply. By luck, however, they arealso representable by vectors (really pseudo vectors), so our mathematics hasbeen made easier for us.

Mathematically, if a and b are any two vectors, the nine quantities aibj forma tensor (although it may have no useful physical purpose). Thus, for the positionvector r, rirj is a tensor, and since δij is also, we see that the right side ofEq. (31.20) is indeed a tensor. Likewise Eq. (31.22) is a tensor, since the twoterms on the right-hand side are tensors.

31-8

31-6 The tensor of stressThe symmetric tensors we have described so far arose as coeﬃcients in relatingone vector to another. We would like to look now at a tensor which has a diﬀerentphysical signiﬁcance—the tensor of stress. Suppose we have a solid object withvarious forces on it. We say that there are various「stresses」inside, by which wemean that there are internal forces between neighboring parts of the material.We have talked a little about such stresses in a two-dimensional case when weconsidered the surface tension in a stretched diaphragm in Section 12-3. We willnow see that the internal forces in the material of a three-dimensional body canbe described in terms of a tensor.

Consider a body of some elastic material—say a block of jello. If we make acut through the block, the material on each side of the cut will, in general, getdisplaced by the internal forces. Before the cut was made, there must have beenforces between the two parts of the block that kept the material in place; we candeﬁne the stresses in terms of these forces. Suppose we look at an imaginaryplane perpendicular to the x-axis—like the plane σ in Fig. 31-5—and ask aboutthe force across a small area ∆y ∆z in this plane. The material on the left of thearea exerts the force ∆F 1 on the material to the right, as shown in part (b) ofthe ﬁgure. There is, of course, the opposite reaction force −∆F 1 exerted on thematerial to the left of the surface. If the area is small enough, we expect that∆F 1 is proportional to the area ∆y ∆z.You are already familiar with one kind of stress—the pressure in a staticliquid. There the force is equal to the pressure times the area and is at rightangles to the surface element. For solids—also for viscous liquids in motion—theforce need not be normal to the surface; there are shear forces in addition topressures (positive or negative). (By a「shear」force we mean the tangentialcomponents of the force across a surface.) All three components of the forcemust be taken into account. Notice also that if we make our cut on a plane withsome other orientation, the forces will be diﬀerent. A complete description of theinternal stress requires a tensor.

Fig. 31-5. The material to the left of theplane σ exerts across the area ∆y ∆z theforce ∆F1 on the material to the right ofthe plane.

Fig. 31-6. The force ∆F1 across an el-ement of area ∆y ∆z perpendicular to thex-axis is resolved into three components∆Fx1, ∆Fy 1, and ∆Fz 1.

We deﬁne the stress tensor in the following way: First, we imagine a cutperpendicular to the x-axis and resolve the force ∆F 1 across the cut into itscomponents ∆Fx1, ∆Fy1, ∆Fz1, as in Fig. 31-6. The ratio of these forces to thearea ∆y ∆z, we call Sxx, Syx, and Szx. For example,

Syx = ∆Fx1∆y ∆z

.

The ﬁrst index y refers to the direction force component; the second index x isnormal to the area. If you wish, you can write the area ∆y ∆z as ∆ax, meaningan element of area perpendicular to x. ThenSyx = ∆Fx1∆ax

Next, we think of an imaginary cut perpendicular to the y-axis. Across a small31-9

.

area ∆x ∆z there will be a force ∆F 2. Again we resolve this force into threecomponents, as shown in Fig. 31-7, and deﬁne the three components of the stress,Sxy, Syy, Szy, as the force per unit area in the three directions. Finally, we makean imaginary cut perpendicular to z and deﬁne the three components Sxz, Syz,and Szz. So we have the nine numbers

(31.23)

Sxx Sxy Sxz

Syx Syy SyzSzx Szy Szz

 .

Sij =

We want to show now that these nine numbers are suﬃcient to describecompletely the internal state of stress, and that Sij is indeed a tensor. Supposewe want to know the force across a surface oriented at some arbitrary angle. Canwe ﬁnd it from Sij? Yes, in the following way: We imagine a little solid ﬁgurewhich has one face N in the new surface, and the other faces parallel to thecoordinate axes. If the face N happened to be parallel to the z-axis, we wouldhave the triangular piece shown in Fig. 31-8. (This is a somewhat special case,but will illustrate well enough the general method.) Now the stress forces onthe little solid triangle in Fig. 31-8 are in equilibrium (at least in the limit ofinﬁnitesimal dimensions), so the total force on it must be zero. We know theforces on the faces parallel to the coordinate axes directly from Sij. Their vectorsum must equal the force on the face N, so we can express this force in termsof Sij.Our assumption that the surface forces on the small triangular volume are inequilibrium neglects any other body forces that might be present, such as gravityor pseudo forces if our coordinate system is not an inertial frame. Notice, however,that such body forces will be proportional to the volume of the little triangleand, therefore, to ∆x ∆y ∆z, whereas all the surface forces are proportional tothe areas such as ∆x ∆y, ∆y ∆z, etc. So if we take the scale of the little wedgesmall enough, the body forces can always be neglected in comparison with thesurface forces.

Let’s now add up the forces on the little wedge. We take ﬁrst the x-component,which is the sum of ﬁve parts—one from each face. However, if ∆z is smallenough, the forces on the triangular faces (perpendicular to the z-axis) will beequal and opposite, so we can forget them. The x-component of the force on thebottom rectangle is

∆Fx2 = Sxy ∆x ∆z.

The x-component of the force on the vertical rectangle is

∆Fx1 = Sxx ∆y ∆z.

Fig. 31-7. The force across an elementof area perpendicular to y is resolved intothree rectangular components.

Fig. 31-8. The force Fn across the face N(whose unit normal is n) is resolved intocomponents.

These two must be equal to the x-component of the force outward across theface N. Let’s call n the unit vector normal to the face N, and the force on it F n;then we have

∆Fxn = Sxx ∆y ∆z + Sxy ∆x ∆z.

The x-component Sxn, of the stress across this plane is equal to ∆Fxn divided

by the area, which is ∆zp∆x2 + ∆y2, orp∆x2 + ∆y2Now ∆x/p∆x2 + ∆y2 is the cosine of the angle θ between n and the y-axis,Similarly, ∆y/p∆x2 + ∆y2 is sin θ = nx. We can write

as shown in Fig. 31-8, so it can also be written as ny, the y-component of n.

(31.24)

We can ﬁnd the force across any surface element in terms of the Sij, so it doesdescribe completely the state of internal stress of the material.Equation (31.24) says that the tensor Sij relates the stress Sn to the unitvector n, just as αij relates P to E. Since n and Sn are vectors, the componentsof Sij must transform as a tensor with changes in coordinate axes. So Sij isindeed a tensor.We can also show that Sij is a symmetric tensor by looking at the forceson a little cube of material. Suppose we take a little cube, oriented with itsfaces parallel to our coordinate axes, and look at it in cross section, as shownin Fig. 31-9. If we let the edge of the cube be one unit, the x- and y-componentsof the forces on the faces normal to the x- and y-axes might be as shown in theﬁgure. If the cube is small, the stresses do not change appreciably from one sideof the cube to the opposite side, so the force components are equal and oppositeas shown. Now there must be no torque on the cube, or it would start spinning.The total torque about the center is (Syx − Sxy) (times the unit edge of the cube),and since the total is zero, Syx is equal to Sxy, and the stress tensor is symmetric.Since Sij is a symmetric tensor, it can be described by an ellipsoid whichwill have three principal axes. For surfaces normal to these axes, the stressesare particularly simple—they correspond to pushes or pulls perpendicular to thesurfaces. There are no shear forces along these faces. For any stress, we canalways choose our axes so that the shear components are zero. If the ellipsoidis a sphere, there are only normal forces in any direction. This corresponds toa hydrostatic pressure (positive or negative). So for a hydrostatic pressure, thetensor is diagonal and all three components are equal; they are, in fact, just equalto the pressure p. We can write

Sij = pδij.

(31.25)The stress tensor—and also its ellipsoid—will, in general, vary from pointto point in a block of material; to describe the whole block we need to give thevalue of each component of Sij as a function of position. So the stress tensor is aﬁeld. We have had scalar ﬁelds, like the temperature T(x, y, z), which give onenumber for each point in space, and vector ﬁelds like E(x, y, z), which give threenumbers for each point. Now we have a tensor ﬁeld which gives nine numbersfor each point in space—or really six for the symmetric tensor Sij. A completedescription of the internal forces in an arbitrarily distorted solid requires sixfunctions of x, y, and z.

31-7 Tensors of higher rankThe stress tensor Sij describes the internal forces of matter. If the materialis elastic, it is convenient to describe the internal distortion in terms of anothertensor Tij—called the strain tensor. For a simple object like a bar of metal, youknow that the change in length, ∆L, is approximately proportional to the force,so we say it obeys Hooke’s law:

∆L = γF.

Fig. 31-9. The x- and y-forces on four

faces of a small unit cube.

For a solid elastic body with arbitrary distortions, the strain Tij is related to thestress Sij by a set of linear equations:

The complete description of the elastic properties of a crystal must be given interms of the coeﬃcients γijkl. This introduces us to a new beast. It is a tensor ofthe fourth rank. Since each index can take on any one of three values, x, y, or z,there are 34 = 81 coeﬃcients. But there are really only 21 diﬀerent numbers.First, since Sij is symmetric, it has only six diﬀerent values, and only 36 diﬀerentcoeﬃcients are needed in Eq. (31.27). But also, Sij can be interchanged with Sklwithout changing the energy, so γijkl must be symmetric if we interchange ijand kl. This reduces the number of diﬀerent coeﬃcients to 21. So to describe theelastic properties of a crystal of the lowest possible symmetry requires 21 elasticconstants! This number is, of course, reduced for crystals of higher symmetry.For example, a cubic crystal has only three elastic constants, and an isotropicsubstance has only two.

That the latter is true can be seen as follows. How can the components of γijklbe independent of the direction of the axes, as they must be if the material isisotropic? Answer: They can be independent only if they are expressible in termsof the tensor δij. There are two possible expressions, δijδkl and δikδjl + δilδjk,which have the required symmetry, so γijkl must be a linear combination of them.Therefore, for isotropic materials,

γijkl = a(δijδkl) + b(δikδjl + δilδjk),

and the material requires two constants, a and b, to describe its elastic properties.We will leave it for you to show that a cubic crystal needs only three.As a ﬁnal example, this time of a third-rank tensor, we have the piezoelectriceﬀect. Under stress, a crystal generates an electric ﬁeld proportional to the stress;hence, in general, the law is

Ei =X

PijkSjk,

where Ei is the electric ﬁeld, and the Pijk are the piezoelectric coeﬃcients—orthe piezoelectric tensor. Can you show that if the crystal has a center of inversion(invariant under x, y, z → −x,−y,−z) the piezoelectric coeﬃcients are all zero?

31-8 The four-tensor of electromagnetic momentumAll the tensors we have looked at so far in this chapter relate to the threedimensions of space; they are deﬁned to have a certain transformation propertyunder spatial rotations. In Chapter 26 we had occasion to use a tensor in thefour dimensions of relativistic space-time—the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor Fµν.The components of such a four-tensor transform under a Lorentz transformationof the coordinates in a special way that we worked out. (Although we did not doit that way, we could have considered the Lorentz transformation as a「rotation」in a four-dimensional「space」called Minkowski space; then the analogy withwhat we are doing here would have been clearer.)

As our last example, we want to consider another tensor in the four di-mensions (t, x, y, z) of relativity theory. When we wrote the stress tensor, wedeﬁned Sij as a component of a force across a unit area. But a force is equal tothe time rate of change of a momentum. Therefore, instead of saying「Sxy is thex-component of the force across a unit area perpendicular to y,」we could equallywell say,「Sxy is the rate of ﬂow of the x-component of momentum through aunit area perpendicular to y.」In other words, each term of Sij also representsthe ﬂow of the i-component of momentum through a unit area perpendicularto the j-direction. These are pure space components, but they are parts of a「larger」tensor Sµν in four dimensions (µ and ν = t, x, y, z) containing additionalcomponents like Stx, Syt, Stt, etc. We will now try to ﬁnd the physical meaningof these extra components.

31-12

We know that the space components represent ﬂow of momentum. We canget a clue on how to extend this to the time dimension by studying another kindof「ﬂow」—the ﬂow of electric charge. For the scalar quantity, charge, the rateof ﬂow (per unit area perpendicular to the ﬂow) is a space vector—the currentdensity vector j. We have seen that the time component of this ﬂow vector isthe density of the stuﬀ that is ﬂowing. For instance, j can be combined with atime component, jt = ρ, the charge density, to make the four-vector jµ = (ρ, j);that is, the µ in jµ takes on the values t, x, y, z to mean「density, rate of ﬂow inthe x-direction, rate of ﬂow in y, rate of ﬂow in z」of the scalar charge.Now by analogy with our statement about the time component of the ﬂow ofa scalar quantity, we might expect that with Sxx, Sxy, and Sxz, describing theﬂow of the x-component of momentum, there should be a time component Sxtwhich would be the density of whatever is ﬂowing; that is, Sxt should be thedensity of x-momentum. So we can extend our tensor horizontally to include at-component. We have

Sxt = density of x-momentum,Sxx = x-ﬂow of x-momentum,Sxy = y-ﬂow of x-momentum,Sxz = z-ﬂow of x-momentum.

Similarly, for the y-component of momentum we have the three components ofﬂow—Syx, Syy, Syz—to which we should add a fourth term:

Syt = density of y-momentum.

And, of course, to Szx, Szy, Szz we would add

Szt = density of z-momentum.

In four dimensions there is also a t-component of momentum, which is, weknow, energy. So the tensor Sij should be extended vertically with Stx, Sty,and Stz, where

Stx = x-ﬂow of energy,Sty = y-ﬂow of energy,Stz = z-ﬂow of energy;

(31.28)

that is, Stx is the ﬂow of energy per unit area and per unit time across a surfaceperpendicular to the x-axis, and so on. Finally, to complete our tensor we need Stt,which would be the density of energy. We have extended our stress tensor Sij ofthree dimensions to the four-dimensional stress-energy tensor Sµν. The index µcan take on the four values t, x, y, and z, meaning, respectively,「density,」「ﬂowper unit area in the x-direction,」「ﬂow per unit area in the y-direction,」and「ﬂow per unit area in the z-direction.」In the same way, ν takes on the four valuest, x, y, z to tell us what ﬂows, namely,「energy,」「momentum in the x-direction,」「momentum in the y-direction,」and「momentum in the z-direction.」As an example, we will discuss this tensor not in matter, but in a region offree space in which there is an electromagnetic ﬁeld. We know that the ﬂow ofenergy is the Poynting vector S = 0c2E × B. So the x-, y-, and z-componentsof S are, from the relativistic point of view, the components Stx, Sty, and Stzof our four-dimensional stress-energy tensor. The symmetry of the tensor Sijcarries over into the time components as well, so the four-dimensional tensor Sµνis symmetric:(31.29)In other words, the components Sxt, Syt, Szt, which are the densities of x, y,and z momentum, are also equal to the x-, y-, and z-components of the Poyntingvector S, the energy ﬂow—as we have already shown in an earlier chapter by adiﬀerent kind of argument.

Sµν = Sνµ.

The remaining components of the electromagnetic stress tensor Sµν can alsobe expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B. That is tosay, we must admit stress or, to put it less mysteriously, ﬂow of momentum inthe electromagnetic ﬁeld. We discussed this in Chapter 27 in connection withEq. (27.21), but did not work out the details.

Refractive Index of Dense Materials

32-1 Polarization of matterWe

want now to discuss the phenomenon of the refraction of light—and also,therefore, the absorption of light—by dense materials. In Chapter 31 of Volume Iwe discussed the theory of the index of refraction, but because of our limitedmathematical abilities at that time, we had to restrict ourselves to ﬁnding theindex only for materials of low density, like gases. The physical principles thatproduced the index were, however, made clear. The electric ﬁeld of the light wavepolarizes the molecules of the gas, producing oscillating dipole moments. Theacceleration of the oscillating charges radiates new waves of the ﬁeld. This newﬁeld, interfering with the old ﬁeld, produces a changed ﬁeld which is equivalentto a phase shift of the original wave. Because this phase shift is proportional tothe thickness of the material, the eﬀect is equivalent to having a diﬀerent phasevelocity in the material. When we looked at the subject before, we neglected thecomplications that arise from such eﬀects as the new wave changing the ﬁelds atthe oscillating dipoles. We assumed that the forces on the charges in the atomscame just from the incoming wave, whereas, in fact, their oscillations are drivennot only by the incoming wave but also by the radiated waves of all the otheratoms. It would have been diﬃcult for us at that time to include this eﬀect, sowe studied only the rareﬁed gas, where such eﬀects are not important.

Now, however, we will ﬁnd that it is very easy to treat the problem by theuse of diﬀerential equations. This method obscures the physical origin of theindex (as coming from the re-radiated waves interfering with the original waves),but it makes the theory for dense materials much simpler. This chapter willbring together a large number of pieces from our earlier work. We’ve taken uppractically everything we will need, so there are relatively few really new ideasto be introduced. Since you may need to refresh your memory about what weare going to need, we give in Table 32-1 a list of the equations we are going touse, together with a reference to the place where each can be found. In mostinstances, we will not take the time to give the physical arguments again, butwill just use the equations.

32-1

We begin by recalling the machinery of the index of refraction for a gas. Wesuppose that there are N particles per unit volume and that each particle behavesas a harmonic oscillator. We use a model of an atom or molecule in which theelectron is bound with a force proportional to its displacement (as though theelectron were held in place by a spring). We emphasized that this was not alegitimate classical model of an atom, but we will show later that the correctquantum mechanical theory gives results equivalent to this model (in simplecases). In our earlier treatment, we did not include the possibility of a dampingforce in the atomic oscillators, but we will do so now. Such a force correspondsto a resistance to the motion, that is, to a force proportional to the velocity ofthe electron. Then the equation of motion is

F = qeE = m(¨x + γ ˙x + ω2

(32.1)where x is the displacement parallel to the direction of E. (We are assuming anisotropic oscillator whose restoring force is the same in all directions. Also, weare taking, for the moment, a linearly polarized wave, so that E doesn’t changedirection.) If the electric ﬁeld acting on the atom varies sinusoidally with time,we write

0x),

E = E0eiωt.

(32.2)

The displacement will then oscillate with the same frequency, and we can let

Substituting ˙x = iωx and ¨x = −ω2x, we can solve for x in terms of E:

x = x0eiωt.

x =

qe/m

−ω2 + iγω + ω20

E.

(32.3)

Knowing the displacement, we can calculate the acceleration ¨x and ﬁnd theradiated wave responsible for the index. This was the way we computed theindex in Chapter 31 of Volume I.

Now, however, we want to take a diﬀerent approach. The induced dipole

moment p of an atom is qex or, using Eq. (32.3),

p =

q2e /m

−ω2 + iγω + ω20

E.

Since p is proportional to E, we write

p = 0α(ω)E,

where α is called the atomic polarizability.* With this deﬁnition, we have

α =

q2e /m0

−ω2 + iγω + ω20

.

(32.4)

(32.5)

(32.6)

The quantum mechanical solution for the motions of electrons in atoms givesa similar answer except with the following modiﬁcations. The atoms have severalnatural frequencies, each frequency with its own dissipation constant γ. Alsothe eﬀective「strength」of each mode is diﬀerent, which we can represent bymultiplying the polarizability for each frequency by a strength factor f, which isa number we expect to be of the order of 1. Representing the three parametersω0, γ, and f by ω0k, γk, and fk for each mode of oscillation, and summing overthe various modes, we modify Eq. (32.6) to read

α(ω) = q2e0m

−ω2 + iγkω + ω20k

.

(32.7)

* Throughout this chapter we follow the notation of Chapter 31 of Volume I, and let αrepresent the atomic polarizability as deﬁned here. In the last chapter, we used α to representthe volume polarizability—the ratio of P to E. In the notation of this chapter P = N α0E(see Eq. 32.8).

32-2

If N is the number of atoms per unit volume in the material, the polarization P

is just N p = 0N αE, and is proportional to E:P = 0N α(ω)E.

(32.8)In other words, when there is a sinusoidal electric ﬁeld acting in a material,there is an induced dipole moment per unit volume which is proportional to theelectric ﬁeld—with a proportionality constant α that, we emphasize, dependsupon the frequency. At very high frequencies, α is small; there is not muchresponse. However, at low frequencies there can be a strong response. Also, theproportionality constant is a complex number, which means that the polarizationdoes not exactly follow the electric ﬁeld, but may be shifted in phase to someextent. At any rate, there is a polarization per unit volume whose magnitude isproportional to the strength of the electric ﬁeld.

32-2 Maxwell’s equations in a dielectricThe existence of polarization in matter means that there are polarizationcharges and currents inside of the material, and these must be put into thecomplete Maxwell equations in order to ﬁnd the ﬁelds. We are going to solveMaxwell’s equations this time in a situation in which the charges and currentsare not zero, as in a vacuum, but are given implicitly by the polarization vector.Our ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd explicitly the charge density ρ and current density j,averaged over a small volume of the same size we had in mind when we deﬁned P .Then the ρ and j we need can be obtained from the polarization.We have seen in Chapter 10 that when the polarization P varies from placeto place, there is a charge density given by

ρpol = −∇ · P .

(32.9)At that time, we were dealing with static ﬁelds, but the same formula is validalso for time-varying ﬁelds. However, when P varies with time, there are chargesin motion, so there is also a polarization current. Each of the oscillating chargescontributes a current equal to its charge qe, times its velocity v. With N suchcharges per unit volume, the current density j is

Since we know that v = dx/dt, then j = N qe(dx/dt), which is just dP/dt.Therefore the current density from the varying polarization is

j = N qev.

jpol = ∂P∂t

.

(32.10)

Our problem is now direct and simple. We write Maxwell’s equations withthe charge density and current density expressed in terms of P , using Eqs. (32.9)and (32.10). (We assume that there are no other currents and charges in thematerial.) We then relate P to E with Eq. (32.8), and we solve the equation forE and B—looking for the wave solutions.Before we do this, we would like to make an historical note. Maxwell originallywrote his equations in a form which was diﬀerent from the one we have been using.Because the equations were written in this diﬀerent form for many years—andare still written that way by many people—we will explain the diﬀerence. In theearly days, the mechanism of the dielectric constant was not fully and clearlyappreciated. The nature of atoms was not understood, nor that there was apolarization of the material. So people did not appreciate that there was acontribution to the charge density ρ from ∇ · P . They thought only in terms ofcharges that were not bound to atoms (such as the charges that ﬂow in wires orare rubbed oﬀ surfaces).

Today, we prefer to let ρ represent the total charge density, including the part

from the bound atomic charges. If we call that part ρpol, we can write

ρ = ρpol + ρother,

32-3

where ρother is the charge density considered by Maxwell and refers not bound toindividual atoms. We would then write

∇ · E = ρpol + ρother

0

.

Substituting ρpol from Eq. (32.9),

or

∇ · E = ρother0

0

∇ · P

(32.11)The current density in the Maxwell equations for ∇ × B also has, in general,

∇ · (0E + P ) = ρother.

contributions from bound atomic currents. We can therefore write

and the Maxwell equation becomes

j = jpol + jother,

c2∇ × B = jother0

+ jpol0

+ ∂E∂t

.

Using Eq. (32.10), we get

0c2∇ × B = jother + ∂∂t

(0E + P ).

Now you can see that if we were to deﬁne a new vector D by

the two ﬁeld equations would become

D = 0E + P ,

and

∇ · D = ρother

0c2∇ × B = jother + ∂D∂t

.

(32.12)

(32.13)

(32.14)

(32.15)

(32.16)

These are actually the forms that Maxwell used for dielectrics. His two remainingequations were

and

,

∇ × E = − ∂B∂t∇ · B = 0,

which are the same as we have been using.

Maxwell and the other early workers also had a problem with magneticmaterials (which we will take up soon). Because they did not know about thecirculating currents responsible for atomic magnetism, they used a current densitythat was missing still another part. Instead of Eq. (32.16), they actually wrote

∇ × H = j

0 + ∂D∂t

,

(32.17)

where H diﬀers from 0c2B because it includes the eﬀects of atomic currents.0 represents what is left of the currents.) So Maxwell had four ﬁeld(Then jvectors—E, D, B, and H—the D and H were hidden ways of not payingattention to what was going on inside the material. You will ﬁnd the equationswritten this way in many places.

To solve the equations, it is necessary to relate D and H to the other ﬁelds,

and people used to write

D = E

and

B = µH.

(32.18)32-4

However, these relations are only approximately true for some materials andeven then only if the ﬁelds are not changing rapidly with time. (For sinusoidallyvarying ﬁelds one often can write the equations this way by making  and µcomplex functions of the frequency, but not for an arbitrary time variation ofthe ﬁelds.) So there used to be all kinds of cheating in solving the equations.We think the right way is to keep the equations in terms of the fundamentalquantities as we now understand them—and that’s how we have done it.

32-3 Waves in a dielectricWe want now to ﬁnd out what kind of electromagnetic waves can exist in adielectric material in which there are no extra charges other than those boundin atoms. So we take ρ = −∇ · P and j = ∂P /∂t. Maxwell’s equations thenbecome

(a) ∇ · E = −∇ · P

(32.19)

We can solve these equations as we have done before. We start by taking the

curl of Eq. (32.19c):

Next, we make use of the vector identity

∇ × (∇ × E) = − ∂∂t

∇ × B.

∇ × (∇ × E) = ∇(∇ · E) − ∇2E,and also substitute for ∇ × B, using Eq. (32.19b); we get∂t2 − 1

∇(∇ · E) − ∇2E = − 10c2

Using Eq. (32.19a) for ∇ · E, we get= − 1

∇2E − 1c2

∂2E∂t2

0

∇(∇ · P ) + 10c2

∂2P∂t2 .

(32.20)

So instead of the wave equation, we now get that the D’Alembertian of E isequal to two terms involving the polarization P .Since P depends on E, however, Eq. (32.20) can still have wave solutions. Wewill now limit ourselves to isotropic dielectrics, so that P is always in the samedirection as E. Let’s try to ﬁnd a solution for a wave going in the z-direction.Then, the electric ﬁeld might vary as ei(ωt−kz). We will also suppose that the waveis polarized in the x-direction—that the electric ﬁeld has only an x-component.We write(32.21)You know that any function of (z − vt) represents a wave that travels with

Ex = E0ei(ωt−kz).

the speed v. The exponent of Eq. (32.21) can be written as

(cid:18)

−ik

z − ωk

(cid:19)

t

,

so, Eq. (32.21) represents a wave with the phase velocity

vph = ω/k.

The index of refraction n is deﬁned (see Chapter 31, Vol. I) by letting

vph = cn

.

32-5

Thus Eq. (32.21) becomes

Ex = E0eiω(t−nz/c).

So we can ﬁnd n by ﬁnding what value of k is required if Eq. (32.21) is to satisfythe proper ﬁeld equations, and then using

n = kcω

.

(32.22)

In an isotropic material, there will be only an x-component of the polarization;then P has no variation with the x-coordinate, so ∇ · P = 0, and we get rid ofthe ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (32.20). Also, since we are assuminga linear dielectric, Px will vary as eiωt, and ∂2Px/∂t2 = −ω2Px. The Laplacianin Eq. (32.20) becomes simply ∂2Ex/∂z2 = −k2Ex, so we get

− k2Ex + ω2

c2 Ex = − ω2

0c2 Px.

(32.23)

Now let us assume for the moment that since E is varying sinusoidally, wecan set P proportional to E, as in Eq. (32.8). (We’ll come back to discuss thisassumption later.) We write

Px = 0N αEx.Then Ex drops out of Eq. (32.23), and we ﬁnd

k2 = ω2c2

(1 + N α).

(32.24)

We have found that a wave like Eq. (32.21), with the wave number k given byEq. (32.24), will satisfy the ﬁeld equations. Using Eq. (32.22), the index n isgiven by(32.25)Let’s compare this formula with what we obtained in our theory of the index

n2 = 1 + N α.

of a gas (Chapter 31, Vol. I). There, we got Eq. (31.19), which is

−ω2 + ω20Taking α from Eq. (32.6), Eq. (32.25) would give us

.

n = 1 + 12

N q2em0

n2 = 1 + N q2em0

1

−ω2 + iγω + ω20

.

(32.26)

(32.27)

First, we have the new term in iγω, because we are including the dissipationof the oscillators. Second, the left-hand side is n instead of n2, and there is anextra factor of 1/2. But notice that if N is small enough so that n is close toone (as it is for a gas), then Eq. (32.27) says that n2 is one plus a small number:n2 = 1 + . We can then write n = √1 +  ≈ 1 + /2, and the two expressionsare equivalent. Thus our new method gives for a gas the same result we foundearlier.

Now you might think that Eq. (32.27) should give the index of refractionfor dense materials also. It needs to be modiﬁed, however, for several reasons.First, the derivation of this equation assumes that the polarizing ﬁeld on eachatom is the ﬁeld Ex. That assumption is not right, however, because in densematerials there is also the ﬁeld produced by other atoms in the vicinity, whichmay be comparable to Ex. We considered a similar problem when we studiedthe static ﬁelds in dielectrics. (See Chapter 11.) You will remember that weestimated the ﬁeld at a single atom by imagining that it sat in a spherical holein the surrounding dielectric. The ﬁeld in such a hole—which we called the localﬁeld—is increased over the average ﬁeld E by the amount P/30. (Remember,32-6

however, that this result is only strictly true in isotropic materials—includingthe special case of a cubic crystal.)

The same arguments will hold for the electric ﬁeld in a wave, so long as thewavelength of the wave is much longer than the spacing between atoms. Limitingourselves to such cases, we write

Elocal = E + P30

.

(32.28)

This local ﬁeld is the one that should be used for E in Eq. (32.3); that is, Eq. (32.8)should be rewritten:

P = 0N αElocal.

(32.29)

Using Elocal from Eq. (32.28), we ﬁnd

P = 0N α

or

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

E + P30

P =

N α

1 − (N α/3) 0E.

(32.30)

In other words, for dense materials P is still proportional to E (for sinusoidalﬁelds). However, the constant of proportionality is not 0N α, as we wrote belowEq. (32.23), but should be 0N α/[1 − (N α/3)]. So we should correct Eq. (32.25)to read

It will be more convenient if we rewrite this equation as

n2 = 1 +

N α

1 − (N α/3) .

3 n2 − 1n2 + 2 = N α,

(32.31)

(32.32)

which is algebraically equivalent. This is known as the Clausius-Mossotti equation.There is another complication in dense materials. Because neighboring atomsare so close, there are strong interactions between them. The internal modesof oscillation are, therefore, modiﬁed. The natural frequencies of the atomicoscillations are spread out by the interactions, and they are usually quite heavilydamped—the resistance coeﬃcient becomes quite large. So the ω0’s and γ’s of thesolid will be quite diﬀerent from those of the free atoms. With these reservations,we can still represent α, at least approximately, by Eq. (32.7). We have then that

3 n2 − 1n2 + 2 = N q2

X

k

fk

−ω2 + iγkω + ω20k

.

(32.33)

One ﬁnal complication. If the dense material is a mixture of several compo-nents, each will contribute to the polarization. The total α will be the sum ofthe contributions from each component of the mixture [except for the inaccuracyof the local ﬁeld approximation, Eq. (32.28), in ordered crystals—eﬀects wediscussed when analyzing ferroelectrics]. Writing Nj as the number of atoms ofeach component per unit volume, we should replace Eq. (32.32) by

Njαj,

(32.34)

where each αj will be given by an expression like Eq. (32.7). Equation (32.34)completes our theory of the index of refraction. The quantity 3(n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2)is given by some complex function of frequency, which is the mean atomicpolarizability α(ω). The precise evaluation of α(ω) (that is, ﬁnding fk, γkand ω0k) in dense substances is a diﬃcult problem of quantum mechanics. It hasbeen done from ﬁrst principles only for a few especially simple substances.

32-7

32-4 The complex index of refractionWe want to look now at the consequences of our result, Eq. (32.33). First,we notice that α is complex, so the index n is going to be a complex number.What does that mean? Let’s say that we write n as the sum of a real and animaginary part:(32.35)where nR and nI are real functions of ω. We write inI with a minus sign, sothat nI will be a positive quantity in all ordinary optical materials. (In ordinaryinactive materials—that are not, like lasers, light sources themselves—γ is apositive number, and that makes the imaginary part of n negative.) Our planewave of Eq. (32.21) is written in terms of n as

n = nR − inI ,

Writing n as in Eq. (32.35), we would have

Ex = E0eiω(t−nz/c).

Ex = E0e−ωnI z/ceiω(t−nRz/c).

(32.36)The term eiω(t−nRz/c) represents a wave travelling with the speed c/nR, so nRrepresents what we normally think of as the index of refraction. But the amplitudeof this wave is

E0e−ωnI z/c,

which decreases exponentially with z. A graph of the strength of the electric ﬁeldat some instant as a function of z is shown in Fig. 32-1, for nI ≈ nR/2π. Theimaginary part of the index represents the attenuation of the wave due to theenergy losses in the atomic oscillators. The intensity of the wave is proportionalto the square of the amplitude, so

This is often written as

Intensity ∝ e−2ωnI z/c.

Intensity ∝ e−βz.

where β = 2ωnI /c is called the absorption coeﬃcient. Thus we have in Eq. (32.33)not only the theory of the index of refraction of materials, but the theory of theirabsorption of light as well.

In what we usually consider to be transparent material, the quantity c/ωnI—which has the dimensions of a length—is quite large in comparison with thethickness of the material.

stant t, if nI ≈ nR/2π.

32-5 The index of a mixtureThere is another prediction of our theory of the index of refraction that wecan check against experiment. Suppose we consider a mixture of two materials.The index of the mixture is not the average of the two indexes, but should begiven in terms of the sum of the two polarizabilities, as in Eq. (32.34). If weask about the index of, say, a sugar solution, the total polarizability is the sumof the polarizability of the water and that of the sugar. Each must, of course,be calculated using for N the number per unit volume of the molecules of theparticular kind. In other words, if a given solution has N1 molecules of water,whose polarizability is α1, and N2 molecules of sucrose (C12H22O11), whosepolarizability is α2, we should have that

We can use this formula to test our theory against experiment by measuringthe index for various concentrations of sucrose in water. We are making severalassumptions here, however. Our formula assumes that there is no chemicalaction when the sucrose is dissolved and that the disturbances to the individual32-8

atomic oscillators are not too diﬀerent for various concentrations. So our resultis certainly only approximate. Anyway, let’s see how good it is.

We have picked the example of a sugar solution because there is a good tableof measurements of the index of refraction in the Handbook of Chemistry andPhysics and also because sugar is a molecular crystal that goes into solutionwithout ionizing or otherwise changing its chemical state.

We give in the ﬁrst three columns of Table 32-2 the data from the handbook.Column A is the percent of sucrose by weight, column B is the measured density(g/cm3), and column C is the measured index of refraction for light whosewavelength is 589.3 millimicrons. For pure sugar we have taken the measuredindex of sugar crystals. The crystals are not isotropic, so the measured index isdiﬀerent along diﬀerent directions. The handbook gives three values:

n1 = 1.5376,We have taken the average.

n2 = 1.5651,

n3 = 1.5705.

Now we could try to compute n for each concentration, but we don’t knowwhat value to take for α1 or α2. Let’s test the theory this way: We will assumethat the polarizability of water (α1) is the same at all concentrations and computethe polarizability of sucrose by using the experiment of values for n and solvingEq. (32.37) for α2. If the theory is correct, we should get the same α2 for allconcentrations.First, we need to know N1 and N2: let’s express them in terms of Avogadro’snumber, N0. Let’s take one liter (1000 cm3) for our unit of volume. Then Ni/N0is the weight per liter divided by the gram-molecular weight. And the weight perliter is the density (multiplied by 1000 to get grams per liter) times the fractionalweight of either the sucrose or the water. In this way, we get N2/N0 and N1/N0as in columns D and E of the table.In column F we have computed 3(n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2) from the experimentalvalues of n in column C. For pure water, 3(n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2) is 0.617, which isequal to just N1α1. We can then ﬁll in the rest of Column G, since for each rowG/E may be in the same ratio—namely, 0.617 : 55.5. Subtracting column Gfrom column F, we get the contribution N2α2 of the sucrose, shown in column H.Dividing these entries by the values of N2/N0 in column D, we get the valueof N0α2 shown in column J.From our theory we would expect all the values of N0α2 to be the same. Theyare not exactly equal, but pretty close. We can conclude that our ideas are fairlycorrect. Even more, we ﬁnd that the polarizability of the sugar molecule doesn’tseem to depend much on its surroundings—its polarizability is nearly the samein a dilute solution as it is in the crystal.

32-9

32-6 Waves in metalsThe theory we have worked out in this chapter for solid materials can also beapplied to good conductors, like metals, with very little modiﬁcation. In metalssome of the electrons have no binding force holding them to any particular atom;it is these「free」electrons which are responsible for the conductivity. There areother electrons which are bound, and the theory above is directly applicableto them. Their inﬂuence, however, is usually swamped by the eﬀects of theconduction electrons. We will consider now only the eﬀects of the free electrons.If there is no restoring force on an electron—but still some resistance to itsmotion—its equation of motion diﬀers from Eq. (32.1) only because the termin ω20 = 0 in the rest of our derivations—except that there is one more diﬀerence. The reason that we had to distinguishbetween the average ﬁeld and the local ﬁeld in a dielectric is that in an insulatoreach of the dipoles is ﬁxed in position, so that it has a deﬁnite relationship tothe position of the others. But because the conduction electrons in a metal movearound all over the place, the ﬁeld on them on the average is just the averageﬁeld E. So the correction we made to Eq. (32.8) by using Eq. (32.28) shouldnot be made for conduction electrons. Therefore the formula for the index ofrefraction for metals should look like Eq. (32.27), except with ω0 set equal tozero, namely,

0x is lacking. So all we have to do is set ω2

n2 = 1 + N q2em0

1

−ω2 + iγω

.

(32.38)

This is only the contribution from the conduction electrons, which we will assumeis the major term for metals.

Now we even know how to ﬁnd what value to use for γ, because it is relatedto the conductivity of the metal. In Chapter 43 of Volume I we discussed howthe conductivity of a metal comes from the diﬀusion of the free electrons throughthe crystal. The electrons go on a jagged path from one scattering to the next,and between scatterings they move freely except for an acceleration due to anyaverage electric ﬁeld (as shown in Fig. 32-2). We found in Chapter 43 of Volume Ithat the average drift velocity is just the acceleration times the average time τbetween collisions. The acceleration is qeE/m, so

vdrift = qeEm

τ.

(32.39)

Fig. 32-2. The motion of a free electron.

This formula assumed that E was constant, so that vdrift was a steady velocity.Since there is no average acceleration, the drag force is equal to the applied force.We have deﬁned γ by saying that γmv is the drag force [see Eq. (32.1)], whichis qeE; therefore we have that

.

(32.40)

Although we cannot easily measure τ directly, we can determine it by mea-suring the conductivity of the metal. It is found experimentally that an electricﬁeld E in a metal produces a current with the density j proportional to E (forisotropic materials):

γ = 1

j = σE.

The proportionality constant σ is called the conductivity. This is just what weexpect from Eq. (32.39) if we set

Then

(32.41)

So τ—and therefore γ—can be related to the observed electrical conductivity. Us-ing Eqs. (32.40) and (32.41), we can rewrite our formula for the index, Eq. (32.38),32-10

in the following form:

This is a convenient formula for the index of refraction of metals.

32-7 Low-frequency and high-frequency approximations; the skin depth and

the plasma frequency

Our result, Eq. (32.42), for the index of refraction for metals predicts quitediﬀerent characteristics for wave propagation at diﬀerent frequencies. Let’sﬁrst see what happens at very low frequencies. If ω is small enough, we canapproximate Eq. (32.42) by

σ.0ωNow, as you can check by taking the square,*

n2 = −i

so for low frequencies,

(32.45)The real and imaginary parts of n have the same magnitude. With such a largeimaginary part to n, the wave is rapidly attenuated in the metal. Referring toEq. (32.36), the amplitude of a wave going in the z-direction decreases as

;

√−i = 1 − i√2n =pσ/20ω (1 − i).

exp[−pσω/20c2 z].

Let’s write this as

e−z/δ,

(32.47)where δ is then the distance in which the wave amplitude decreases by thefactor e−1 = 1/2.72—or roughly one-third. The amplitude of such a wave as afunction of z is shown in Fig. 32-3. Since electromagnetic waves will penetrateinto a metal only this distance, δ is called the skin depth. It is given by

(32.48)Now what do we mean by「low」frequencies? Looking at Eq. (32.42), we seethat it can be approximated by Eq. (32.44) only if ωτ is much less than one andif ω0/σ is also much less than one—that is, our low-frequency approximationapplies when

δ =p20c2/σω.

(32.49)

Let’s see what frequencies these correspond to for a typical metal like copper.We compute τ by using Eq. (32.43), and σ/0, by using the measured conductivity.We take the following data from a handbook:

σ = 5.76 × 107 (ohm·meter)−1atomic weight = 63.5 grams,density = 8.9 grams·cm−3,Avogadro’s number = 6.02 × 1023 (gram atomic weight)−1.

* Or writing −i = e−iπ/2;

√−i = e−iπ/4 = cos π/4 − i sin π/4, which gives the same result.32-11

(32.44)

(32.46)

Fig. 32-3. The amplitude of a transverseelectromagnetic wave as a function of dis-tance into a metal.

If we assume that there is one free electron per atom, then the number of electronsper cubic meter is

N = 8.5 × 1028 meter−3.

Using

we get

qe = 1.6 × 10−19 coulomb,0 = 8.85 × 10−12 farad · meter−1,m = 9.11 × 10−31 kg,

τ = 2.4 × 10−12 sec,1= 4.1 × 1013 sec−1,τ= 6.5 × 1018 sec−1.σ0

So for frequencies less than about 1012 cycles per second, copper will have the「low-frequency」behavior we describe (that means for waves whose free-spacewavelength is longer than 0.3 millimeters—very short radio waves!).

For these waves, the skin depth in copper is

r0.028 m2 · sec−1

ω

δ =

For microwaves of 10,000 megacycles per second (3-cm waves)

δ = 6.7 × 10−5 cm.

The wave penetrates a very small distance.

We can see from this why in studying cavities (or waveguides) we needed toworry only about the ﬁelds inside the cavity, and not in the metal or outside thecavity. Also, we see why the losses in a cavity are reduced by a thin plating ofsilver or gold. The losses come from the current, which are appreciable only in athin layer equal to the skin depth.

Suppose we look now at the index of a metal like copper at high frequencies.For very high frequencies ωτ is much greater than one, and Eq. (32.42) is wellapproximated by

For waves of high frequencies the index of a metal becomes real—and less thanone! This is also evident from Eq. (32.38) if the dissipation term with γ isneglected, as can be done for very large ω. Equation (32.38) gives

n2 = 1 − N q2m0ω2 ,

e

(32.51)

which is, of course, the same as Eq. (32.50). We have seen before the quan-e /m0, which we called the square of the plasma frequency (Section 7-3):tity N q2

The plasma frequency is a kind of「critical」frequency.For ω < ωp the index of a metal has an imaginary part, and waves areattenuated; but for ω (cid:29) ωp the index is real, and the metal becomes transparent.You know, of course, that metals are reasonably transparent to x-rays. But32-12

n2 = 1 − σ

.

0ω2τ

(32.50)

some metals are even transparent in the ultraviolet.In Table 32-3 we givefor several metals the experimental observed wavelength at which they beginto become transparent. In the second column we give the calculated criticalwavelength λp = 2πc/ωp. Considering that the experimental wavelength is nottoo well deﬁned, the ﬁt of the theory is fairly good.You may wonder why the plasma frequency ωp should have anything to dowith the propagation of electromagnetic waves in metals. The plasma frequencycame up in Chapter 7 as the natural frequency of density oscillations of the freeelectrons. (A clump of electrons is repelled by electric forces, and the inertia ofthe electrons leads to an oscillation of density.) So longitudinal plasma waves areresonant at ωp. But we are now talking about transverse electromagnetic waves,and we have found that transverse waves are absorbed for frequencies below ωp.(It’s an interesting and not accidental coincidence.)Although we have been talking about wave propagation in metals, you appre-ciate by this time the universality of the phenomena of physics—that it doesn’tmake any diﬀerence whether the free electrons are in a metal or whether theyare in the plasma of the ionosphere of the earth, or in the atmosphere of astar. To understand radio propagation in the ionosphere, we can use the sameexpressions—using, of course, the proper values for N and τ. We can see nowwhy long radio waves are absorbed or reﬂected by the ionosphere, whereas shortwaves go right through. (Short waves must be used for communication withsatellites.)

We have talked about the high- and low-frequency extremes for wave prop-agation in metals. For the in-between frequencies the full-blown formula ofEq. (32.42) must be used. In general, the index will have real and imaginaryparts; the wave is attenuated as it propagates into the metal. For very thin layers,metals are somewhat transparent even at optical frequencies. As an example,special goggles for people who work around high-temperature furnaces are madeby evaporating a thin layer of gold on glass. The visible light is transmitted fairlywell—with a strong green tinge—but the infrared is strongly absorbed.

Finally, it cannot have escaped the reader that many of these formulas resemblein some ways those for the dielectric constant κ discussed in Chapter 10. Thedielectric constant κ measures the response of the material to a constant ﬁeld,that is, for ω = 0. If you look carefully at the deﬁnition of n and κ you seethat κ is simply the limit of n2 as ω → 0. Indeed, placing ω = 0 and n2 = κin equations of this chapter will reproduce the equations of the theory of thedielectric constant of Chapter 11.

Re(cid:29)ection from Surfaces

33-1 Reﬂection and refraction of lightThe

subject of this chapter is the reﬂection and refraction of light—or elec-tromagnetic waves in general—at surfaces. We have already discussed the lawsof reﬂection and refraction in Chapters 26 and 33 of Volume I. Here’s what wefound out there:

1. The angle of reﬂection is equal to the angle of incidence. With the angles

deﬁned as shown in Fig. 33-1,

θr = θi.

(33.1)

(Snell’s law):

2. The product n sin θ is the same for the incident and transmitted beams(33.2)3. The intensity of the reﬂected light depends on the angle of incidence andalso on the direction of polarization. For E perpendicular to the plane ofincidence, the reﬂection coeﬃcient R⊥ is

n1 sin θi = n2 sin θt.

R⊥ = IrIi

= sin2(θi − θt)sin2(θi + θt) .

(33.5)

(Earlier, we used i for the incident angle and r for the refracted angle. Sincewe can’t use r for both「refracted」and「reﬂected」angles, we are now usingθi = incident angle, θr = reﬂected angle, and θt = transmitted angle.)Our earlier discussion is really about as far as anyone would normally need togo with the subject, but we are going to do it all over again a diﬀerent way. Why?One reason is that we assumed before that the indexes were real (no absorptionin the materials). But another reason is that you should know how to deal withwhat happens to waves at surfaces from the point of view of Maxwell’s equations.We’ll get the same answers as before, but now from a straightforward solution ofthe wave problem, rather than by some clever arguments.

We want to emphasize that the amplitude of a surface reﬂection is not aproperty of the material, as is the index of refraction. It is a「surface property,」one that depends precisely on how the surface is made. A thin layer of extraneousjunk on the surface between two materials of indices n1 and n2 will usually changethe reﬂection. (There are all kinds of possibilities of interference here—like thecolors of oil ﬁlms. Suitable thickness can even reduce the reﬂected amplitude tozero for a given frequency; that’s how coated lenses are made.) The formulas wewill derive are correct only if the change of index is sudden—within a distance verysmall compared with one wavelength. For light, the wavelength is about 5000 Å,so by a「smooth」surface we mean one in which the conditions change in goinga distance of only a few atoms (or a few angstroms). Our equations will work33-1

for light for highly polished surfaces. In general, if the index changes graduallyover a distance of several wavelengths, there is very little reﬂection at all.

33-2 Waves in dense materialsFirst, we remind you about the convenient way of describing a sinusoidalplane wave we used in Chapter 34 of Volume I. Any ﬁeld component in the wave(we use E as an example) can be written in the form

E = E0ei(ωt−k·r),

(33.6)where E represents the amplitude at the point r (from the origin) at the time t.The vector k points in the direction the wave is travelling, and its magnitude |k| =k = 2π/λ is the wave number. The phase velocity of the wave is vph = ω/k; fora light wave in a material of index n, vph = c/n, so

k = ωnc

(33.7)Suppose k is in the z-direction; then k · r is just kz, as we have often used it.For k in any other direction, we should replace z by rk, the distance from theorigin in the k-direction; that is, we should replace kz by krk, which is just k · r.(See Fig. 33-2.) So Eq. (33.6) is a convenient representation of a wave in anydirection.

.

We must remember, of course, that

k · r = kxx + kyy + kzz,

where kx, ky, and kz are the components of k along the three axes. In fact, wepointed out once that (ω, kx, ky, kz) is a four-vector, and that its scalar productwith (t, x, y, z) is an invariant. So the phase of a wave is an invariant, andEq. (33.6) could be written

E = E0eikµxµ .

But we don’t need to be that fancy now.For a sinusoidal E, as in Eq. (33.6), ∂E/∂t is the same as iωE, and ∂E/∂xis −ikxE, and so on for the other components. You can see why it is veryconvenient to use the form in Eq. (33.6) when working with diﬀerential equations—diﬀerentiations are replaced by multiplications. One further useful point: Theoperation ∇ = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z) gets replaced by the three multiplications(−ikx,−iky,−ikz). But these three factors transform as the components of thevector k, so the operator ∇ gets replaced by multiplication with −ik:

→ iω,∂∂t∇ → −ik.

(33.8)This remains true for any ∇ operation—whether it is the gradient, or thedivergence, or the curl. For instance, the z-component of ∇ × E is

.

∂Ey∂x

− ∂Ex∂yIf both Ey and Ex vary as e−ik·r, then we get−ikxEy + ikyEx,which is, you see, the z-component of −ik × E.So we have the very useful general fact that whenever you have to take thegradient of a vector that varies as a wave in three dimensions (they are animportant part of physics), you can always take the derivations quickly andalmost without thinking by remembering that the operation ∇ is equivalent tomultiplication by −ik.

33-2

For instance, the Faraday equation

becomes for a wave

This tells us that

∇ × E = − ∂B∂t

−ik × E = −iωB.

B = k × E

ω

,

(33.9)

.

(33.10)

which corresponds to the result we found earlier for waves in free space—thatB, in a wave, is at right angles to E and to the wave direction. (In free space,ω/k = c.) You can remember the sign in Eq. (33.9) from the fact that k is in thedirection of Poynting’s vector S = 0c2E × B.If you use the same rule with the other Maxwell equations, you get again theresults of the last chapter and, in particular, thatk · k = k2 = ω2n2c2But since we know that, we won’t do it again.

If you want to entertain yourself, you can try the following terrifying problemthat was the ultimate test for graduate students back in 1890: solve Maxwell’sequations for plane waves in an anisotropic crystal, that is, when the polariza-tion P is related to the electric ﬁeld E by a tensor of polarizability. You should,of course, choose your axes along the principal axes of the tensor, so that therelations are simplest (then Px = αaEx, Py = αbEy, and Pz = αcEz), but letthe waves have an arbitrary direction and polarization. You should be ableto ﬁnd the relations between E and B, and how k varies with direction andwave polarization. Then you will understand the optics of an anisotropic crystal.It would be best to start with the simpler case of a birefringent crystal—likecalcite—for which two of the polarizabilities are equal (say, αb = αc), and see ifyou can understand why you see double when you look through such a crystal.If you can do that, then try the hardest case, in which all three α’s are diﬀerent.Then you will know whether you are up to the level of a graduate student of 1890.In this chapter, however, we will consider only isotropic substances.

We know from experience that when a plane wave arrives at the boundarybetween two diﬀerent materials—say, air and glass, or water and oil—there is awave reﬂected and a wave transmitted. Suppose we assume no more than that andsee what we can work out. We choose our axes with the yz-plane in the surface andthe xy-plane perpendicular to the incident wave surfaces, as shown in Fig. 33-3.33-3

The electric vector of the incident wave can then be written as

Ei = E0ei(ωt−k·r).

Since k is perpendicular to the z-axis,

k · r = kxx + kyy.

We write the reﬂected wave as

(We0 is theknow, of course, that the frequency is the same and the magnitude of ksame as for the incident wave, but we are not going to assume even that. Wewill let it come out of the mathematical machinery.) Finally, we write for thetransmitted wave,

33-3 The boundary conditionsAll we have done so far is to describe the three waves; our problem now is towork out the parameters of the reﬂected and transmitted waves in terms of thoseof the incident wave. How can we do that? The three waves we have describedsatisfy Maxwell’s equations in the uniform material, but Maxwell’s equationsmust also be satisﬁed at the boundary between the two diﬀerent materials. Sowe must now look at what happens right at the boundary. We will ﬁnd thatMaxwell’s equations demand that the three waves ﬁt together in a certain way.As an example of what we mean, the y-component of the electric ﬁeld E mustbe the same on both sides of the boundary. This is required by Faraday’s law,

∇ × E = − ∂B∂t

,

(33.19)

as we can see in the following way. Consider a little rectangular loop Γ whichstraddles the boundary, as shown in Fig. 33-4. Equation (33.19) says that theline integral of E around Γ is equal to the rate of change of the ﬂux of B throughthe loop:

I

Z

E · ds = − ∂∂t

Γ

B · n da.

Now imagine that the rectangle is very narrow, so that the loop encloses aninﬁnitesimal area. If B remains ﬁnite (and there’s no reason it should be inﬁniteat the boundary!) the ﬂux through the area is zero. So the line integral of E33-4

Ey 1 is obtained from(cid:72)

Fig. 33-4. A boundary condition Ey 2 =

Γ E · ds = 0.

must be zero. If Ey1 and Ey2 are the components of the ﬁeld on the two sides ofthe boundary and if the length of the rectangle is l, we have

or

Ey1l − Ey2l = 0

Ey1 = Ey2,

(33.20)

as we have said. This gives us one relation among the ﬁelds of the three waves.The procedure of working out the consequences of Maxwell’s equations at theboundary is called「determining the boundary conditions.」Ordinarily, it is doneby ﬁnding as many equations like Eq. (33.20) as one can, by making argumentsabout little rectangles like Γ in Fig. 33-4, or by using little gaussian surfaces thatstraddle the boundary. Although that is a perfectly good way of proceeding, itgives the impression that the problem of dealing with a boundary is diﬀerent forevery diﬀerent physical problem.

For example, in a problem of heat ﬂow across a boundary, how are thetemperatures on the two sides related? Well, you could argue, for one thing, thatthe heat ﬂow to the boundary from one side would have to equal the ﬂow awayfrom the other side. It is usually possible, and generally quite useful, to workout the boundary conditions by making such physical arguments. There may betimes, however, when in working on some problem you have only some equations,and you may not see right away what physical arguments to use. So although weare at the moment interested only in an electromagnetic problem, where we canmake the physical arguments, we want to show you a method that can be usedfor any problem—a general way of ﬁnding what happens at a boundary directlyfrom the diﬀerential equations.

We begin by writing all the Maxwell equations for a dielectric—and this time

we are very speciﬁc and write out explicitly all the components:

Now these equations must all hold in region 1 (to the left of the boundary)and in region 2 (to the right of the boundary). We have already written thesolutions in regions 1 and 2. Finally, they must also be satisﬁed in the boundary,which we can call region 3. Although we usually think of the boundary as beingsharply discontinuous, in reality it is not. The physical properties change veryrapidly but not inﬁnitely fast. In any case, we can imagine that there is a veryrapid, but continuous, transition of the index between region 1 and 2, in a shortdistance we can call region 3. Also, any ﬁeld quantity like Px, or Ey, etc., willmake a similar kind of transition in region 3. In this region, the diﬀerentialequations must still be satisﬁed, and it is by following the diﬀerential equationsin this region that we can arrive at the needed「boundary conditions.」

For instance, suppose that we have a boundary between vacuum (region 1)and glass (region 2). There is nothing to polarize in the vacuum, so P 1 = 0. Let’ssay there is some polarization P 2 in the glass. Between the vacuum and the glassthere is a smooth, but rapid, transition. If we look at any component of P , say Px,it might vary as drawn in Fig. 33-5(a). Suppose now we take the ﬁrst of ourequations, Eq. (33.21). It involves derivatives of the components of P with respectto x, y, and z. The y- and z-derivatives are not interesting; nothing spectacular ishappening in those directions. But the x-derivative of Px will have some very largevalues in region 3, because of the tremendous slope of Px. The derivative ∂Px/∂xwill have a sharp spike at the boundary, as shown in Fig. 33-5(b). If we imaginesquashing the boundary to an even thinner layer, the spike would get much higher.If the boundary is really sharp for the waves we are interested in, the magnitudeof ∂Px/∂x in region 3 will be much, much greater than any contributions wemight have from the variation of P in the wave away from the boundary—sowe ignore any variations other than those due to the boundary.

Now how can Eq. (33.21) be satisﬁed if there is a whopping big spike on theright-hand side? Only if there is an equally whopping big spike on the other side.Something on the left-hand side must also be big. The only candidate is ∂Ex/∂x,because the variations with y and z are only those small eﬀects in the wave wejust mentioned. So −0(∂Ex/∂x) must be as drawn in Fig. 33-5(c)—just a copyof ∂Px/∂x. We have that

If we integrate this equation with respect to x across region 3, we conclude that(33.25)In other words, the jump in 0Ex in going from region 1 to region 2 must beequal to the jump in −Px.

0(Ex2 − Ex1) = −(Px2 − Px1).

We can rewrite Eq. (33.25) as

∂Ex∂x

= − ∂Px∂x

.

Fig. 33-5. The ﬁelds in the transitionregion 3 between two diﬀerent materials inregions 1 and 2.

0Ex2 + Px2 = 0Ex1 + Px1,

(33.26)which says that the quantity (0Ex + Px) has equal values in region 2 and region 1.People say: the quantity (0Ex + Px) is continuous across the boundary. Wehave, in this way, one of our boundary conditions.Although we took as an illustration the case in which P 1 was zero becauseregion 1 was a vacuum, it is clear that the same argument applies for any twomaterials in the two regions, so Eq. (33.26) is true in general.

Let’s now go through the rest of Maxwell’s equations and see what each ofthem tells us. We take next Eq. (33.22a). There are no x-derivatives, so it doesn’ttell us anything. (Remember that the ﬁelds themselves do not get especiallylarge at the boundary; only the derivatives with respect to x can become so hugethat they dominate the equation.) Next, we look at Eq. (33.22b). Ah! There isan x-derivative! We have ∂Ez/∂x on the left-hand side. Suppose it has a hugederivative. But wait a moment! There is nothing on the right-hand side to matchit with; therefore Ez cannot have any jump in going from region 1 to region 2. [Ifit did, there would be a spike on the left of Eq. (33.22b) but none on the right,33-6

and the equation would be false.] So we have a new condition:

By the same argument, Eq. (33.22c) gives

Ez2 = Ez1.

Ey2 = Ey1.

(33.27)

(33.28)

This last result is just what we got in Eq. (33.20) by a line integral argument.We go on to Eq. (33.23). The only term that could have a spike is ∂Bx/∂x.

But there’s nothing on the right to match it, so we conclude that

Bx2 = Bx1.

(33.29)

On to the last of Maxwell’s equations! Equation (33.24a) gives nothing,because there are no x-derivatives. Equation (33.24b) has one, −c2 ∂Bz/∂x, butagain, there is nothing to match it with. We get

(33.30)

Bz2 = Bz1.The last equation is quite similar, and givesBy2 = By1.

(33.31)The last three equations gives us that B2 = B1. We want to emphasize,however, that we get this result only when the materials on both sides of theboundary are nonmagnetic—or rather, when we can neglect any magnetic eﬀectsof the materials. This can usually be done for most materials, except ferromagneticones. (We will treat the magnetic properties of materials in some later chapters.)Our program has netted us the six relations between the ﬁelds in region 1and those in region 2. We have put them all together in Table 33-1. We can nowuse them to match the waves in the two regions. We want to emphasize, however,that the idea we have just used will work in any physical situation in which youhave diﬀerential equations and you want a solution that crosses a sharp boundarybetween two regions where some property changes. For our present purposes,we could have easily derived the same equations by using arguments about theﬂuxes and circulations at the boundary. (You might see whether you can get thesame result that way.) But now you have seen a method that will work in caseyou ever get stuck and don’t see any easy argument about the physics of what ishappening at the boundary—you can just work with the equations.

33-4 The reﬂected and transmitted wavesNow we are ready to apply our boundary conditions to the waves we wrote

down in Section 33-2. We had:

0ei(ω0t−k00 ei(ω00t−k00

Ei = E0ei(ωt−kxx−kyy),Er = E0yy),Et = E00x x−k00y y),Bi = k × Ei,ω0 × ErBr = kω000 × Etω00

(33.32)(33.33)(33.34)

(33.35)

(33.36)

(33.37)

We have one further bit of knowledge: E is perpendicular to its propagationvector k for each wave.

(E1)y = (E2)y(E1)z = (E2)z

B1 = B2

(The surface is in the yz-plane)

The results will depend on the direction of the E-vector (the「polarization」) ofthe incoming wave. The analysis is much simpliﬁed if we treat separately the caseof an incident wave with its E-vector parallel to the「plane of incidence」(that is,the xy-plane) and the case of an incident wave with the E-vector perpendicularto the plane of incidence. A wave of any other polarization is just a linearcombination of two such waves. In other words, the reﬂected and transmittedintensities are diﬀerent for diﬀerent polarizations, and it is easiest to pick thetwo simplest cases and treat them separately.

We will carry through the analysis for an incoming wave polarized perpendic-ular to the plane of incidence and then just give you the result for the other. Weare cheating a little by taking the simplest case, but the principle is the same forboth. So we take that Ei has only a z-component, and since all the E-vectorsare in the same direction we can leave oﬀ the vector signs.So long as both materials are isotropic, the induced oscillations of charges inthe material will also be in the z-direction, and the E-ﬁeld of the transmittedand radiated waves will have only z-components. So for all the waves, Ex and Eyand Px and Py are zero. The waves will have their E- and B-vectors as drawn inFig. 33-6. (We are cutting a corner here on our original plan of getting everythingfrom the equations. This result would also come out of the boundary conditions,but we can save a lot of algebra by using the physical argument. When you havesome spare time, see if you can get the same result from the equations. It is clearthat what we have said agrees with the equations; it is just that we have notshown that there are no other possibilities.)Now our boundary conditions, Eqs. (33.26) through (33.31), give relationsbetween the components of E and B in regions 1 and 2. For region 2 we haveonly the transmitted wave, but in region 1 we have two waves. Which one do weuse? The ﬁelds in region 1 are, of course, the superposition of the ﬁelds of theincident and reﬂected waves. (Since each satisﬁes Maxwell’s equations, so doesthe sum.) So when we use the boundary conditions, we must use that

E1 = Ei + Er,

E2 = Et,

and similarly for the B’s.new information; only Eq. (33.27) is useful. It says that

For the polarization we are considering, Eqs. (33.26) and (33.28) give us no

Ei + Er = Et,

at the boundary, that is, for x = 0. So we have thatyy) = E00

E0ei(ωt−kyy) + E0

(33.38)which must be true for all t and for all y. Suppose we look ﬁrst at y = 0. Thenwe have

0 ei(ω00t−k00

0ei(ω0t−k0

y y),

E0eiωt + E0

0eiω0t = E00

0 eiω00t.

This equation says that two oscillating terms are equal to a third oscillation. Thatcan happen only if all the oscillations have the same frequency. (It is impossiblefor three—or any number—of such terms with diﬀerent frequencies to add tozero for all times.) So

(33.39)As we knew all along, the frequencies of the reﬂected and transmitted waves arethe same as that of the incident wave.

ω00 = ω0 = ω.

We should really have saved ourselves some trouble by putting that in at thebeginning, but we wanted to show you that it can also be got out of the equations.When you are doing a real problem, it is usually the best thing to put everythingyou know into the works right at the start and save yourself a lot of trouble.

By deﬁnition, the magnitude of k is given by k2 = n2ω2/c2, so we have also

that

k002n22

= k02n21

= k2n21

.

(33.40)

33-8

Now look at Eq. (33.38) for t = 0. Using again the same kind of argumentwe have just made, but this time based on the fact that the equation must holdfor all values of y, we get that

k00

y

= k0

y

= ky.

(33.41)

From Eq. (33.40), k02 = k2, so

Combining this with Eq. (33.41), we have that

x

k0

= −kx.

(33.42)The two equations (33.41) and (33.42) give us that the angle of reﬂection is equalto the angle of incidence, as we expected. (See Fig. 33-3.) The reﬂected wave is(33.43)

0ei(ωt+kxx−kyy).For the transmitted wave we already have that

Suppose for a moment that n1 and n2 are real numbers (that the imaginaryparts of the indexes are very small). Then all the k’s are also real numbers, andfrom Fig. 33-3 we ﬁnd that

k00k00 = sin θt.

(33.46)

From (33.44) we get that

n2 sin θt = n1 sin θi,

(33.47)which is Snell’s law of refraction—again, something we already knew. If theindexes are not real, the wave numbers are complex, and we have to use Eq. (33.45).[We could still deﬁne the angles θi and θt by Eq. (33.46), and Snell’s law,Eq. (33.47), would be true in general. But then the「angles」also are complexnumbers, thereby losing their simple geometrical interpretation as angles. It isbest then to describe the behavior of the waves by their complex kx or k00values.]So far, we haven’t found anything new. We have just had the simple-mindeddelight of getting some obvious answers from a complicated mathematical ma-chinery. Now we are ready to ﬁnd the amplitudes of the waves which we havenot yet known. Using our results for the ω’s and k’s, the exponential factors inEq. (33.38) can be cancelled, and we getE0 + E0

(33.48)Since both E00 are unknown, we need one more relationship. We must useanother of the boundary conditions. The equations for Ex and Ey are no help,because all the E’s have only a z-component. So we must use the conditionson B. Let’s try Eq. (33.29):

0 and E00

0 = E000 .

Bxt = k00Bxr = k0y EtyErω00ω0= k0= ky, we get thatE0 + E00 = E000 .

But this is just Eq. (33.48) all over again! We’ve just wasted time gettingsomething we already knew.

We could try Eq. (33.30), Bz2 = Bz1, but there are no z-components of B!So there’s only one equation left: Eq. (33.31), By2 = By1. For the three waves:

Byi = − kxEiω

,

Byr = − k0xErω0

,

Byt = − k00xEtω00

, give us what we wanted

If we begin with a wave polarized with its E-vector parallel to the plane ofincidence, E will have both x- and y-components, as shown in Fig. 33-7. Thealgebra is straightforward but more complicated. (The work can be somewhatreduced by expressing things in this case in terms of the magnetic ﬁelds, whichare all in the z-direction.) One ﬁnds that

(33.53)

(33.54)

Let’s see whether our results agree with those we got earlier. Equation (33.3)is the result we worked out in Chapter 33 of Volume I for the ratio of the intensityof the reﬂected wave to the intensity of the incident wave. Then, however, wewere considering only real indexes. For real indexes (and k’s), we can write

kx = k cos θi = ωn1c= k00 cos θt = ωn2k00c

x

cos θi,cos θt.

Substituting in Eq. (33.51), we have

E00E0

= n1 cos θi − n2 cos θtn1 cos θi + n2 cos θt

,

(33.55)

33-10

which does not look the same as Eq. (33.3). It will, however, if we use Snell’s lawto get rid of the n’s. Setting n2 = n1 sin θi/ sin θt, and multiplying the numeratorand denominator by sin θt, we get

E00E0

= cos θi sin θt − sin θi cos θtcos θi sin θt + sin θi cos θt

.

The numerator and denominator are just the sines of −(θi − θt) and (θi + θt); weget

E00E0

= −sin(θi − θt)sin(θi + θt) .

(33.56)Since E00 and E0 are in the same material, the intensities are proportional tothe squares of the electric ﬁelds, and we get the same result as before. Similarly,Eq. (33.53) is the same as Eq. (33.4).

For waves which arrive at normal incidence, θi = 0 and θt = 0. Equa-tion (33.56) gives 0/0, which is not very useful. We can, however, go back toEq. (33.55), which gives

(33.57)

This result, naturally, applies for「either」polarization, since for normal incidencethere is no special「plane of incidence.」

33-5 Reﬂection from metalsWe can now use our results to understand the interesting phenomenon ofreﬂection from metals. Why is it that metals are shiny? We saw in the lastchapter that metals have an index of refraction which, for some frequencies, hasa large imaginary part. Let’s see what we would get for the reﬂected intensitywhen light shines from air (with n = 1) onto a material with n = −inI. ThenEq. (33.55) gives (for normal incidence)

E00E0

= 1 + inI1 − inI

.

For the intensity of the reﬂected wave, we want the square of the absolute valuesof E0

0 and E0:

or

= |E00|2|E0|2= 1 + n21 + n2

(33.58)

(33.59)

Fig. 33-8. A material which absorbs lightstrongly at the frequency ω also reﬂectslight of that frequency.

For a material with an index which is a pure imaginary number, there is 100 per-cent reﬂection!

Metals do not reﬂect 100 percent, but many do reﬂect visible light very well.In other words, the imaginary part of their indexes is very large. But we haveseen that a large imaginary part of the index means a strong absorption. Sothere is a general rule that if any material gets to be a very good absorber atany frequency, the waves are strongly reﬂected at the surface and very little getsinside to be absorbed. You can see this eﬀect with strong dyes. Pure crystals ofthe strongest dyes have a「metallic」shine. Probably you have noticed that at theedge of a bottle of purple ink the dried dye will give a golden metallic reﬂection,or that dried red ink will sometimes give a greenish metallic reﬂection. Red inkabsorbs out the greens of transmitted light, so if the ink is very concentrated, itwill exhibit a strong surface reﬂection for the frequencies of green light.You can easily show this eﬀect by coating a glass plate with red ink andletting it dry. If you direct a beam of white light at the back of the plate, asshown in Fig. 33-8, there will be a transmitted beam of red light and a reﬂectedbeam of green light.

Fig. 33-9. Total internal reﬂection.

33-6 Total internal reﬂectionIf light goes from a material like glass, with a real index n greater than 1,

toward, say, air, with an index n2 equal to 1, Snell’s law says that

sin θt = n sin θi.

The angle θt of the transmitted wave becomes 90◦ when the incident angle θi isequal to the「critical angle」θc given by

Et = E00

0 e±kI xei(ωt−kyy).

The wave amplitude either grows or drops oﬀ exponentially with increasing x.Clearly, what we want here is the negative sign. Then the amplitude of thewave to the right of the boundary will go as shown in Fig. 33-9. Notice that kIis ω/c—which is of the order 1/λ0, the reciprocal of the free-space wavelength ofthe light. When light is totally reﬂected from the inside of a glass-air surface,there are ﬁelds in the air, but they extend beyond the surface only a distance ofthe order of the wavelength of the light.

We can now see how to answer the following question: If a light wave in glassarrives at the surface at a large enough angle, it is reﬂected; if another pieceof glass is brought up to the surface (so that the「surface」in eﬀect disappears)the light is transmitted. Exactly when does this happen? Surely there must becontinuous change from total reﬂection to no reﬂection! The answer, of course,is that if the air gap is so small that the exponential tail of the wave in theair has an appreciable strength at the second piece of glass, it will shake theelectrons there and generate a new wave, as shown in Fig. 33-10. Some light33-12

Fig. 33-11. A demonstration of the penetration of internally reﬂected waves.

will be transmitted. (Clearly, our solution is incomplete; we should solve all theequations again for a thin layer of air between two regions of glass.)

This transmission eﬀect can be observed with ordinary light only if the airgap is very small (of the order of the wavelength of light, like 10−5 cm), butit is easily demonstrated with three-centimeter waves. Then the exponentiallydecreasing ﬁeld extends several centimeters. A microwave apparatus that showsthe eﬀect is drawn in Fig. 33-11. Waves from a small three-centimeter transmitterare directed at a 45◦ prism of paraﬃn. The index of refraction of paraﬃn forthese frequencies is 1.50, and therefore the critical angle is 41.5◦. So the wave istotally reﬂected from the 45◦ face and is picked up by detector A, as indicatedin Fig. 33-11(a). If a second paraﬃn prism is placed in contact with the ﬁrst, asshown in part (b) of the ﬁgure, the wave passes straight through and is pickedup at detector B. If a gap of a few centimeters is left between the two prisms,as in part (c), there are both transmitted and reﬂected waves. The electric ﬁeldoutside the 45◦ face of the prism in Fig. 33-11(a) can also be shown by bringingdetector B to within a few centimeters of the surface.

The Magnetism of Matter

34-1 Diamagnetism and paramagnetismIn

this chapter we are going to talk about the magnetic properties of materials.The material which has the most striking magnetic properties is, of course, iron.Similar magnetic properties are shared also by the elements nickel, cobalt, and—at suﬃciently low temperatures (below 16◦C)—by gadolinium, as well as by anumber of peculiar alloys. That kind of magnetism, called ferromagnetism, issuﬃciently striking and complicated that we will discuss it in a special chapter.However, all ordinary substances do show some magnetic eﬀects, although verysmall ones—a thousand to a million times less than the eﬀects in ferromagneticmaterials. Here we are going to describe ordinary magnetism, that is to say, themagnetism of substances other than the ferromagnetic ones.

This small magnetism is of two kinds. Some materials are attracted towardmagnetic ﬁelds; others are repelled. Unlike the electrical eﬀect in matter, whichalways causes dielectrics to be attracted, there are two signs to the magnetic eﬀect.These two signs can be easily shown with the help of a strong electromagnetwhich has one sharply pointed pole piece and one ﬂat pole piece, as drawn inFig. 34-1. The magnetic ﬁeld is much stronger near the pointed pole than nearthe ﬂat pole. If a small piece of material is fastened to a long string and suspendedbetween the poles, there will, in general, be a small force on it. This small forcecan be seen by the slight displacement of the hanging material when the magnetis turned on. The few ferromagnetic materials are attracted very strongly towardthe pointed pole; all other materials feel only a very weak force. Some are weaklyattracted to the pointed pole; and some are weakly repelled.

34-8 The magnetic energy of atoms

Review: Section 15-1,「The forces ona current loop; energy of adipole.」

Fig. 34-1. A small cylinder of bismuth isweakly repelled by the sharp pole; a piece ofaluminum is attracted.

The eﬀect is most easily seen with a small cylinder of bismuth, which isrepelled from the high-ﬁeld region. Substances which are repelled in this wayare called diamagnetic. Bismuth is one of the strongest diamagnetic materials,but even with it, the eﬀect is still quite weak. Diamagnetism is always veryweak. If a small piece of aluminum is suspended between the poles, there isalso a weak force, but toward the pointed pole. Substances like aluminum arecalled paramagnetic. (In such an experiment, eddy-current forces arise when themagnet is turned on and oﬀ, and these can give oﬀ strong impulses. You must becareful to look for the net displacement after the hanging object settles down.)34-1

We want now to describe brieﬂy the mechanisms of these two eﬀects. First, inmany substances the atoms have no permanent magnetic moments, or rather, allthe magnets within each atom balance out so that the net moment of the atom iszero. The electron spins and orbital motions all exactly balance out, so that anyparticular atom has no average magnetic moment. In these circumstances, whenyou turn on a magnetic ﬁeld little extra currents are generated inside the atom byinduction. According to Lenz’s law, these currents are in such a direction as tooppose the increasing ﬁeld. So the induced magnetic moments of the atoms aredirected opposite to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is the mechanism of diamagnetism.Then there are some substances for which the atoms do have a permanentmagnetic moment—in which the electron spins and orbits have a net circulatingcurrent that is not zero. So besides the diamagnetic eﬀect (which is alwayspresent), there is also the possibility of lining up the individual atomic magneticmoments. In this case, the moments try to line up with the magnetic ﬁeld (inthe way the permanent dipoles of a dielectric are lined up by the electric ﬁeld),and the induced magnetism tends to enhance the magnetic ﬁeld. These are theparamagnetic substances. Paramagnetism is generally fairly weak because thelining-up forces are relatively small compared with the forces from the thermalmotions which try to derange the order. It also follows that paramagnetism isusually sensitive to the temperature. (The paramagnetism arising from the spinsof the electrons responsible for conduction in a metal constitutes an exception.We will not be discussing this phenomenon here.) For ordinary paramagnetism,the lower the temperature, the stronger the eﬀect. There is more lining-up at lowtemperatures when the deranging eﬀects of the collisions are less. Diamagnetism,on the other hand, is more or less independent of the temperature.In anysubstance with built-in magnetic moments there is a diamagnetic as well as aparamagnetic eﬀect, but the paramagnetic eﬀect usually dominates.

In Chapter 11 we described a ferroelectric material, in which all the electricdipoles get lined up by their own mutual electric ﬁelds. It is also possible toimagine the magnetic analog of ferroelectricity, in which all the atomic momentswould line up and lock together. If you make calculations of how this shouldhappen, you will ﬁnd that because the magnetic forces are so much smaller thanthe electric forces, thermal motions should knock out this alignment even attemperatures as low as a few tenths of a degree Kelvin. So it would be impossibleat room temperature to have any permanent lining up of the magnets.

On the other hand, this is exactly what does happen in iron—it does get linedup. There is an eﬀective force between the magnetic moments of the diﬀerentatoms of iron which is much, much greater than the direct magnetic interaction.It is an indirect eﬀect which can be explained only by quantum mechanics. It isabout ten thousand times stronger than the direct magnetic interaction, and iswhat lines up the moments in ferromagnetic materials. We discuss this specialinteraction in a later chapter.

Now that we have tried to give you a qualitative explanation of diamagnetismand paramagnetism, we must correct ourselves and say that it is not possible tounderstand the magnetic eﬀects of materials in any honest way from the pointof view of classical physics. Such magnetic eﬀects are a completely quantum-mechanical phenomenon. It is, however, possible to make some phoney classicalarguments and to get some idea of what is going on. We might put it this way.You can make some classical arguments and get guesses as to the behavior of thematerial, but these arguments are not「legal」in any sense because it is absolutelyessential that quantum mechanics be involved in every one of these magneticphenomena. On the other hand, there are situations, such as in a plasma or aregion of space with many free electrons, where the electrons do obey the lawsof classical mechanics. And in those circumstances, some of the theorems fromclassical magnetism are worth while. Also, the classical arguments are of somevalue for historical reasons. The ﬁrst few times that people were able to guess atthe meaning and behavior of magnetic materials, they used classical arguments.Finally, as we have already illustrated, classical mechanics can give us some usefulguesses as to what might happen—even though the really honest way to study34-2

this subject would be to learn quantum mechanics ﬁrst and then to understandthe magnetism in terms of quantum mechanics.

On the other hand, we don’t want to wait until we learn quantum mechanicsinside out to understand a simple thing like diamagnetism. We will have tolean on the classical mechanics as kind of half showing what happens, realizing,however, that the arguments are really not correct. We therefore make a seriesof theorems about classical magnetism that will confuse you because they willprove diﬀerent things. Except for the last theorem, every one of them will bewrong. Furthermore, they will all be wrong as a description of the physical world,because quantum mechanics is left out.

34-2 Magnetic moments and angular momentumThe ﬁrst theorem we want to prove from classical mechanics is the following:If an electron is moving in a circular orbit (for example, revolving around anucleus under the inﬂuence of a central force), there is a deﬁnite ratio betweenthe magnetic moment and the angular momentum. Let’s call J the angularmomentum and µ the magnetic moment of the electron in the orbit. Themagnitude of the angular momentum is the mass of the electron times thevelocity times the radius. (See Fig. 34-2.) It is directed perpendicular to theplane of the orbit.

J = mvr.

(34.1)(This is, of course, a nonrelativistic formula, but it is a good approximation foratoms, because for the electrons involved v/c is generally of the order of e2/c ≈1/137, or about 1 percent.)The magnetic moment of the same orbit is the current times the area. (SeeSection 14-5.) The current is the charge per unit time which passes any point onthe orbit, namely, the charge q times the frequency of rotation. The frequency isthe velocity divided by the circumference of the orbit; so

I = q

v2πrThe area is πr2, so the magnetic moment isµ = qvr2 .

.

(34.2)

Fig. 34-2. For any circular orbit the mag-netic moment µ is q/2m times the angularmomentum J.

J (orbit).

µ = q2m

µ = − qe2m

J (electron orbit).

It is also directed perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. So J and µ are in thesame direction:(34.3)Their ratio depends neither on the velocity nor on the radius. For any particlemoving in a circular orbit the magnetic moment is equal to q/2m times theangular momentum. For an electron, the charge is negative—we can call it −qe;so for an electron(34.4)That’s what we would expect classically and, miraculously enough, it is alsotrue quantum-mechanically. It’s one of those things. However, if you keep goingwith the classical physics, you ﬁnd other places where it gives the wrong answers,and it is a great game to try to remember which things are right and which thingsare wrong. We might as well give you immediately what is true in general inquantum mechanics. First, Eq. (34.4) is true for orbital motion, but that’s notthe only magnetism that exists. The electron also has a spin rotation about itsown axis (something like the earth rotating on its axis), and as a result of thatspin it has both an angular momentum and a magnetic moment. But for reasonsthat are purely quantum-mechanical—there is no classical explanation—the ratioof µ to J for the electron spin is twice as large as it is for orbital motion of thespinning electron:

µ = − qem

J (electron spin).

(34.5)

34-3

In any atom there are, generally speaking, several electrons and some combi-nation of spin and orbit rotations which builds up a total angular momentum anda total magnetic moment. Although there is no classical reason why it should beso, it is always true in quantum mechanics that (for an isolated atom) the direc-tion of the magnetic moment is exactly opposite to the direction of the angularmomentum. The ratio of the two is not necessarily either −qe/m or −qe/2m,but somewhere in between, because there is a mixture of the contributions fromthe orbits and the spins. We can write

(cid:19)

(cid:18) qe

2m

µ = −g

J ,

(34.6)

where g is a factor which is characteristic of the state of the atom. It would be 1for a pure orbital moment, or 2 for a pure spin moment, or some other numberin between for a complicated system like an atom. This formula does not, ofcourse, tell us very much. It says that the magnetic moment is parallel to theangular momentum, but can have any magnitude. The form of Eq. (34.6) isconvenient, however, because g—called the「Landé g-factor」—is a dimensionlessconstant whose magnitude is of the order of one. It is one of the jobs of quantummechanics to predict the g-factor for any particular atomic state.You might also be interested in what happens in nuclei. In nuclei there areprotons and neutrons which may move around in some kind of orbit and at thesame time, like an electron, have an intrinsic spin. Again the magnetic momentis parallel to the angular momentum. Only now the order of magnitude of theratio of the two is what you would expect for a proton going around in a circle,with m in Eq. (34.3) equal to the proton mass. Therefore it is usual to write fornuclei

µ = g

J ,

(34.7)

(cid:19)

(cid:18) qe

2mp

where mp is the mass of the proton, and g—called the nuclear g-factor—is anumber near one, to be determined for each nucleus.Another important diﬀerence for a nucleus is that the spin magnetic momentof the proton does not have a g-factor of 2, as the electron does. For a proton,g = 2· (2.79). Surprisingly enough, the neutron also has a spin magnetic moment,and its magnetic moment relative to its angular momentum is 2 · (−1.91). Theneutron, in other words, is not exactly「neutral」in the magnetic sense. It is likea little magnet, and it has the kind of magnetic moment that a rotating negativecharge would have.

34-3 The precession of atomic magnetsOne of the consequences of having the magnetic moment proportional tothe angular momentum is that an atomic magnet placed in a magnetic ﬁeldwill precess. First we will argue classically. Suppose that we have the magneticmoment µ suspended freely in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. It will feel a torque τ,equal to µ × B, which tries to bring it in line with the ﬁeld direction. But theatomic magnet is a gyroscope—it has the angular momentum J. Therefore thetorque due to the magnetic ﬁeld will not cause the magnet to line up. Instead, themagnet will precess, as we saw when we analyzed a gyroscope in Chapter 20 ofVolume I. The angular momentum—and with it the magnetic moment—precessesabout an axis parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. We can ﬁnd the rate of precessionby the same method we used in Chapter 20 of the ﬁrst volume.

Suppose that in a small time ∆t the angular momentum changes from Jto J0, as drawn in Fig. 34-3, staying always at the same angle θ with respectto the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld B. Let’s call ωp the angular velocity ofthe precession, so that in the time ∆t the angle of precession is ωp ∆t. Fromthe geometry of the ﬁgure, we see that the change of angular momentum in thetime ∆t is

∆J = (J sin θ)(ωp ∆t).

34-4

So the rate of change of the angular momentum is

dJdtwhich must be equal to the torque:

= ωpJ sin θ,

The angular velocity of precession is then

τ = µB sin θ.

ωp = µJ

B.

Substituting µ/J from Eq. (34.6), we see that for an atomic system

ωp = g

;

qeB2m

(34.8)

(34.9)

(34.10)

(34.11)

the precession frequency is proportional to B. It is handy to remember that foran atom (or electron)

fp = ωp2π

= (1.4 megacycles/gauss)gB,

(34.12)

Fig. 34-3. An object with angular momen-tum J and a parallel magnetic moment µplaced in a magnetic ﬁeld B precesses withthe angular velocity ωp.

and that for a nucleus

fp = ωp2π

= (0.76 kilocycles/gauss)gB.

(34.13)

(The formulas for atoms and nuclei are diﬀerent only because of the diﬀerentconventions for g for the two cases.)

According to the classical theory, then, the electron orbits—and spins—in anatom should precess in a magnetic ﬁeld. Is it also true quantum-mechanically? Itis essentially true, but the meaning of the「precession」is diﬀerent. In quantummechanics one cannot talk about the direction of the angular momentum in thesame sense as one does classically; nevertheless, there is a very close analogy—soclose that we continue to call it「precession.」We will discuss it later when wetalk about the quantum-mechanical point of view.

34-4 DiamagnetismNext we want to look at diamagnetism from the classical point of view. Itcan be worked out in several ways, but one of the nice ways is the following.Suppose that we slowly turn on a magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of an atom. Asthe magnetic ﬁeld changes an electric ﬁeld is generated by magnetic induction.From Faraday’s law, the line integral of E around any closed path is the rate ofchange of the magnetic ﬂux through the path. Suppose we pick a path Γ which isa circle of radius r concentric with the center of the atom, as shown in Fig. 34-4.The average tangential electric ﬁeld E around this path is given by

E2πr = − ddt

(Bπr2),

and there is a circulating electric ﬁeld whose strength is

E = − r2

dBdt

.

Fig. 34-4. The induced electric forces on

the electrons in an atom.

The induced electric ﬁeld acting on an electron in the atom produces atorque equal to −qeEr, which must equal the rate of change of the angularmomentum dJ/dt:

dBdt

.

(34.14)

34-5

= qer22

dJdt

Integrating with respect to time from zero ﬁeld, we ﬁnd that the change in angularmomentum due to turning on the ﬁeld is

∆J = qer2

2 B.

(34.15)

This is the extra angular momentum from the twist given to the electrons as theﬁeld is turned on.This added angular momentum makes an extra magnetic moment which,because it is an orbital motion, is just −qe/2m times the angular momentum.The induced diamagnetic moment is

∆µ = − qe2m

e r2∆J = − q24m

B.

(34.16)

The minus sign (as you can see is right by using Lenz’s law) means that theadded moment is opposite to the magnetic ﬁeld.

We would like to write Eq. (34.16) a little diﬀerently. The r2 which appearsis the radius from an axis through the atom parallel to B, so if B is along thez-direction, it is x2 + y2. If we consider spherically symmetric atoms (or averageover atoms with their natural axes in all directions) the average of x2 + y2 is 2/3of the average of the square of the true radial distance from the center point ofthe atom. It is therefore usually more convenient to write Eq. (34.16) as

∆µ = − q2e6m

hr2iavB.

(34.17)

In any case, we have found an induced atomic moment proportional to themagnetic ﬁeld B and opposing it. This is diamagnetism of matter. It is thismagnetic eﬀect that is responsible for the small force on a piece of bismuth in anonuniform magnetic ﬁeld. (You could compute the force by working out theenergy of the induced moments in the ﬁeld and seeing how the energy changes asthe material is moved into or out of the high-ﬁeld region.)We are still left with the problem: What is the mean square radius, hr2iav?Classical mechanics cannot supply an answer. We must go back and start overwith quantum mechanics. In an atom we cannot really say where an electron is,but only know the probability that it will be at some place. If we interpret hr2iav tomean the average of the square of the distance from the center for the probabilitydistribution, the diamagnetic moment given by quantum mechanics is just thesame as formula (34.17). This equation, of course, is the moment for one electron.The total moment is given by the sum over all the electrons in the atom. Thesurprising thing is that the classical argument and quantum mechanics givethe same answer, although, as we shall see, the classical argument that givesEq. (34.17) is not really valid in classical mechanics.

The same diamagnetic eﬀect occurs even when an atom already has a per-manent moment. Then the system will precess in the magnetic ﬁeld. As thewhole atom precesses, it takes up an additional small angular velocity, and thatslow turning gives a small current which represents a correction to the magneticmoment. This is just the diamagnetic eﬀect represented in another way. But wedon’t really have to worry about that when we talk about paramagnetism. Ifthe diamagnetic eﬀect is ﬁrst computed, as we have done here, we don’t haveto worry about the fact that there is an extra little current from the precession.That has already been included in the diamagnetic term.

34-5 Larmor’s theoremWe can already conclude something from our results so far. First of all, inthe classical theory the moment µ was always proportional to J, with a givenconstant of proportionality for a particular atom. There wasn’t any spin of theelectrons, and the constant of proportionality was always −qe/2m; that is tosay, in Eq. (34.6) we should set g = 1. The ratio of µ to J was independent34-6

of the internal motion of the electrons. Thus, according to the classical theory,all systems of electrons would precess with the same angular velocity. (This isnot true in quantum mechanics.) This result is related to a theorem in classicalmechanics that we would now like to prove. Suppose we have a group of electronswhich are all held together by attraction toward a central point—as the electronsare attracted by a nucleus. The electrons will also be interacting with each other,and can, in general, have complicated motions. Suppose you have solved forthe motions with no magnetic ﬁeld and then want to know what the motionswould be with a weak magnetic ﬁeld. The theorem says that the motion with aweak magnetic ﬁeld is always one of the no-ﬁeld solutions with an added rotation,about the axis of the ﬁeld, with the angular velocity ωL = qeB/2m. (This is thesame as ωp, if g = 1.) There are, of course, many possible motions. The point isthat for every motion without the magnetic ﬁeld there is a corresponding motionin the ﬁeld, which is the original motion plus a uniform rotation. This is calledLarmor’s theorem, and ωL is called the Larmor frequency.We would like to show how the theorem can be proved, but we will let youwork out the details. Take, ﬁrst, one electron in a central force ﬁeld. The force onit is just F (r), directed toward the center. If we now turn on a uniform magneticﬁeld, there is an additional force, qv × B; so the total force is

F (r) + qv × B.

(34.18)Now let’s look at the same system from a coordinate system rotating with angularvelocity ω about an axis through the center of force and parallel to B. This isno longer an inertial system, so we have to put in the proper pseudo forces—thecentrifugal and Coriolis forces we talked about in Chapter 19 of Volume I. Wefound there that in a frame rotating with angular velocity ω, there is an apparenttangential force proportional to vr, the radial component of velocity:

Ft = −2mωvr.

(34.19)

And there is an apparent radial force which is given by

Fr = mω2r + 2mωvt,

(34.20)where vt is the tangential component of the velocity, measured in the rotatingframe. (The radial component vr for rotating and inertial frames is the same.)Now for small enough angular velocities (that is, if ωr (cid:28) vt), we can neglectthe ﬁrst term (centrifugal) in Eq. (34.20) in comparison with the second (Coriolis).Then Eqs. (34.19) and (34.20) can be written together as

F = −2mω × v.

(34.21)If we now combine a rotation and a magnetic ﬁeld, we must add the force inEq. (34.21) to that in Eq. (34.18). The total force isF (r) + qv × B + 2mv × ω

(34.22)[we reverse the cross product and the sign of Eq. (34.21) to get the last term].Looking at our result, we see that if

2mω = −qB

the two terms on the right cancel, and in the moving frame the only force is F (r).The motion of the electron is just the same as with no magnetic ﬁeld—and, ofcourse, no rotation. We have proved Larmor’s theorem for one electron. Sincethe proof assumes a small ω, it also means that the theorem is true only for weakmagnetic ﬁelds. The only thing we could ask you to improve on is to take thecase of many electrons mutually interacting with each other, but all in the samecentral ﬁeld, and prove the same theorem. So no matter how complex an atomis, if it has a central ﬁeld the theorem is true. But that’s the end of the classicalmechanics, because it isn’t true in fact that the motions precess in that way. Theprecession frequency ωp of Eq. (34.11) is only equal to ωL if g happens to beequal to 1.

34-7

34-6 Classical physics gives neither diamagnetism nor paramagnetismNow we would like to demonstrate that according to classical mechanics therecan be no diamagnetism and no paramagnetism at all. It sounds crazy—ﬁrst,we have proved that there are paramagnetism, diamagnetism, precessing orbits,and so on, and now we are going to prove that it is all wrong. Yes!—We aregoing to prove that if you follow the classical mechanics far enough, there are nosuch magnetic eﬀects—they all cancel out. If you start a classical argument in acertain place and don’t go far enough, you can get any answer you want. But theonly legitimate and correct proof shows that there is no magnetic eﬀect whatever.It is a consequence of classical mechanics that if you have any kind of system—a gas with electrons, protons, and whatever—kept in a box so that the whole thingcan’t turn, there will be no magnetic eﬀect. It is possible to have a magnetic eﬀectif you have an isolated system, like a star held together by itself, which can startrotating when you put on the magnetic ﬁeld. But if you have a piece of materialthat is held in place so that it can’t start spinning, then there will be no magneticeﬀects. What we mean by holding down the spin is summarized this way: At agiven temperature we suppose that there is only one state of thermal equilibrium.The theorem then says that if you turn on a magnetic ﬁeld and wait for the systemto get into thermal equilibrium, there will be no paramagnetism or diamagnetism—there will be no induced magnetic moment. Proof: According to statisticalmechanics, the probability that a system will have any given state of motion isproportional to e−U/kT , where U is the energy of that motion. Now what is theenergy of motion? For a particle moving in a constant magnetic ﬁeld, the energy isthe ordinary potential energy plus mv2/2, with nothing additional for the magneticﬁeld. [You know that the forces from electromagnetic ﬁelds are q(E + v× B), andthat the rate of work F · v is just qE · v, which is not aﬀected by the magneticﬁeld.] So the energy of a system, whether it is in a magnetic ﬁeld or not, is alwaysgiven by the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. Since the probability of anymotion depends only on the energy—that is, on the velocity and position—it is thesame whether or not there is a magnetic ﬁeld. For thermal equilibrium, therefore,the magnetic ﬁeld has no eﬀect. If we have one system in a box, and then haveanother system in a second box, this time with a magnetic ﬁeld, the probabilityof any particular velocity at any point in the ﬁrst box is the same as in the second.If the ﬁrst box has no average circulating current (which it will not have if it isin equilibrium with the stationary walls), there is no average magnetic moment.Since in the second box all the motions are the same, there is no average magneticmoment there either. Hence, if the temperature is kept constant and thermalequilibrium is re-established after the ﬁeld is turned on, there can be no magneticmoment induced by the ﬁeld—according to classical mechanics. We can only geta satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomena from quantum mechanics.Unfortunately, we cannot assume that you have a thorough understandingof quantum mechanics, so this is hardly the place to discuss the matter. On theother hand, we don’t always have to learn something ﬁrst by learning the exactrules and then by learning how they are applied in diﬀerent cases. Almost everysubject that we have taken up in this course has been treated in a diﬀerent way.In the case of electricity, we wrote the Maxwell equations on「Page One」and thendeduced all the consequences. That’s one way. But we will not now try to begina new「Page One,」writing the equations of quantum mechanics and deducingeverything from them. We will just have to tell you some of the consequencesof quantum mechanics, before you learn where they come from. So here we go.

34-7 Angular momentum in quantum mechanicsWe have already given you a relation between the magnetic moment and theangular momentum. That’s pleasant. But what do the magnetic moment andthe angular momentum mean in quantum mechanics? In quantum mechanics itturns out to be best to deﬁne things like magnetic moments in terms of the otherconcepts such as energy, in order to make sure that one knows what it means.34-8

Now, it is easy to deﬁne a magnetic moment in terms of energy, because theenergy of a moment in a magnetic ﬁeld is, in the classical theory, µ· B. Therefore,the following deﬁnition has been taken in quantum mechanics: If we calculatethe energy of a system in a magnetic ﬁeld and we ﬁnd that it is proportionalto the ﬁeld strength (for small ﬁeld), the coeﬃcient is called the component ofmagnetic moment in the direction of the ﬁeld. (We don’t have to get so elegantfor our work now; we can still think of the magnetic moment in the ordinary, tosome extent classical, sense.)

Now we would like to discuss the idea of angular momentum in quantummechanics—or rather, the characteristics of what, in quantum mechanics, iscalled angular momentum. You see, when you go to new kinds of laws, youcan’t just assume that each word is going to mean exactly the same thing. Youmay think, say,「Oh, I know what angular momentum is. It’s that thing thatis changed by a torque.」But what’s a torque? In quantum mechanics we haveto have new deﬁnitions of old quantities. It would, therefore, be legally best tocall it by some other name such as「quantangular momentum,」or somethinglike that, because it is the angular momentum as deﬁned in quantum mechanics.But if we can ﬁnd a quantity in quantum mechanics which is identical to our oldidea of angular momentum when the system becomes large enough, there is nouse in inventing an extra word. We might as well just call it angular momentum.With that understanding, this odd thing that we are about to describe is angularmomentum. It is the thing which in a large system we recognize as angularmomentum in classical mechanics.

First, we take a system in which angular momentum is conserved, such as anatom all by itself in empty space. Now such a thing (like the earth spinning onits axis) could, in the ordinary sense, be spinning around any axis one wished tochoose. And for a given spin, there could be many diﬀerent「states,」all of thesame energy, each「state」corresponding to a particular direction of the axis of theangular momentum. So in the classical theory, with a given angular momentum,there is an inﬁnite number of possible states, all of the same energy.

It turns out in quantum mechanics, however, that several strange thingshappen. First, the number of states in which such a system can exist is limited—there is only a ﬁnite number. If the system is small, the ﬁnite number is verysmall, and if the system is large, the ﬁnite number gets very, very large. Second,we cannot describe a「state」by giving the direction of its angular momentum, butonly by giving the component of the angular momentum along some direction—sayin the z-direction. Classically, an object with a given total angular momentum Jcould have, for its z-component, any value from +J to −J. But quantum-mechanically, the z-component of angular momentum can have only certaindiscrete values. Any given system—a particular atom, or a nucleus, or anything—with a given energy, has a characteristic number j, and its z-component of angularmomentum can only be one of the following set of values:

j(j − 1)(j − 2)

...

−(j − 2)−(j − 1)−j

(34.23)

The largest z-component is j times ; the next smaller is one unit of  less, and soon down to −j. The number j is called「the spin of the system.」(Some people callit the「total angular momentum quantum number」; but we’ll call it the「spin.」)You may be worried that what we are saying can only be true for some「special」z-axis. But that is not so. For a system whose spin is j, the componentof angular momentum along any axis can have only one of the values in (34.23).34-9

Although it is quite mysterious, we ask you just to accept it for the moment. Wewill come back and discuss the point later. You may at least be pleased to hearthat the z-component goes from some number to minus the same number, sothat we at least don’t have to decide which is the plus direction of the z-axis.(Certainly, if we said that it went from +j to minus a diﬀerent amount, thatwould be inﬁnitely mysterious, because we wouldn’t have been able to deﬁne thez-axis, pointing the other way.)Now if the z-component of angular momentum must go down by integersfrom +j to −j, then j must be an integer. No! Not quite; twice j must be aninteger. It is only the diﬀerence between +j and −j that must be an integer.So, in general, the spin j is either an integer or a half-integer, depending onwhether 2j is even or odd. Take, for instance, a nucleus like lithium, which has aspin of three-halves, j = 3/2. Then the angular momentum around the z-axis, inunits of , is one of the following:

+3/2+1/2−1/2−3/2.

There are four possible states, each of the same energy, if the nucleus is in emptyspace with no external ﬁelds. If we have a system whose spin is two, then thez-component of angular momentum has only the values, in units of ,

210−1−2.

If you count how many states there are for a given j, there are (2j+1) possibilities.In other words, if you tell me the energy and also the spin j, it turns out thatthere are exactly (2j + 1) states with that energy, each state corresponding toone of the diﬀerent possible values of the z-component of the angular momentum.We would like to add one other fact. If you pick out any atom of known jat random and measure the z-component of the angular momentum, then youmay get any one of the possible values, and each of the values is equally likely.All of the states are in fact single states, and each is just as good as any other.Each one has the same「weight」in the world. (We are assuming that nothinghas been done to sort out a special sample.) This fact has, incidentally, a simpleclassical analog. If you ask the same question classically: What is the likelihoodof a particular z-component of angular momentum if you take a random sampleof systems, all with the same total angular momentum?—the answer is that allvalues from the maximum to the minimum are equally likely. (You can easilywork that out.) The classical result corresponds to the equal probability of the(2j + 1) possibilities in quantum mechanics.From what we have so far, we can get another interesting and somewhatsurprising conclusion. In certain classical calculations the quantity that appearsin the ﬁnal result is the square of the magnitude of the angular momentum J—inother words, J · J. It turns out that it is often possible to guess at the correctquantum-mechanical formula by using the classical calculation and the followingsimple rule: Replace J2 = J · J by j(j + 1)2. This rule is commonly used,and usually gives the correct result, but not always. We can give the followingargument to show why you might expect this rule to work.

The scalar product J · J can be written as+ J2

J · J = J2

Since it is a scalar, it should be the same for any orientation of the spin. Supposewe pick samples of any given atomic system at random and make measurements34-10

But since J · J is the same for all orientations, its average is, of course, just itsconstant value; we have(34.24)If we now say that we will use the same equation for quantum mechanics,ziav. We just have to take the sum of the (2j + 1) possible

We will leave it for you to show that Eq. (34.25), together with Eq. (34.24), givesthe general result

J · J = j(j + 1)2.

(34.26)Although we would think classically that the largest possible value of the z-component of J is just the magnitude of J—namely, √less thanpj(j + 1). The angular momentum is never「completely along theJ · J—quantum mechan-ically the maximum of Jz is always a little less than that, because j is alwaysz-direction.」

34-8 The magnetic energy of atomsNow we want to talk again about the magnetic moment. We have said thatin quantum mechanics the magnetic moment of a particular atomic system canbe written in terms of the angular momentum by Eq. (34.6);

(cid:19)

(cid:18) qe

µ = −g

(34.27)

where −qe and m are the charge and mass of the electron.An atomic magnet placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld will have an extramagnetic energy which depends on the component of its magnetic moment alongthe ﬁeld direction. We know that

Umag = −µ · B.Choosing our z-axis along the direction of B,Umag = −µzB.

Using Eq. (34.27), we have that

Umag = g

JzB.

(34.28)

(34.29)

Quantum mechanics says that Jz can have only certain values: j, (j − 1),. . . , −j. Therefore, the magnetic energy of an atomic system is not arbitrary;it can have only certain values. Its maximum value, for instance, is

(cid:19)

(cid:18) qe

34-11

The quantity qe/2m is usually given the name「the Bohr magneton」andwritten µB:

The possible values of the magnetic energy are

µB = qe2m

.

Umag = gµBB

Jz ,

where Jz/ takes on the possible values j, (j − 1), (j − 2), . . . , (−j + 1), −j.In other words, the energy of an atomic system is changed when it is put in amagnetic ﬁeld by an amount that is proportional to the ﬁeld, and proportionalto Jz. We say that the energy of an atomic system is「split into 2j +1 levels」by amagnetic ﬁeld. For instance, an atom whose energy is U0 outside a magnetic ﬁeldand whose j is 3/2, will have four possible energies when placed in a ﬁeld. Wecan show these energies by an energy-level diagram like that drawn in Fig. 34-5.Any particular atom can have only one of the four possible energies in any givenﬁeld B. That is what quantum mechanics says about the behavior of an atomicsystem in a magnetic ﬁeld.The simplest「atomic」system is a single electron. The spin of an electronis 1/2, so there are two possible states: Jz = /2 and Jz = −/2. For an electron,at rest (no orbital motion), the spin magnetic moment has a g-value of 2, so themagnetic energy can be either ±µBB. The possible energies in a magnetic ﬁeldare shown in Fig. 34-6. Speaking loosely we say that the electron either has itsspin「up」(along the ﬁeld) or「down」(opposite the ﬁeld).

For systems with higher spins, there are more states. We can think that thespin is「up」or「down」or cocked at some「angle」in between, depending on thevalue of Jz.erties of materials in the next chapter.

We will use these quantum mechanical results to discuss the magnetic prop-

35-1 Quantized magnetic statesIn

the last chapter we described how in quantum mechanics the angularmomentum of a thing does not have an arbitrary direction, but its componentalong a given axis can take on only certain equally spaced, discrete values. Itis a shocking and peculiar thing. You may think that perhaps we should not gointo such things until your minds are more advanced and ready to accept thiskind of an idea. Actually, your minds will never become more advanced—in thesense of being able to accept such a thing easily. There isn’t any descriptive wayof making it intelligible that isn’t so subtle and advanced in its own form thatit is more complicated than the thing you were trying to explain. The behaviorof matter on a small scale—as we have remarked many times—is diﬀerent fromanything that you are used to and is very strange indeed. As we proceed withclassical physics, it is a good idea to try to get a growing acquaintance with thebehavior of things on a small scale, at ﬁrst as a kind of experience without anydeep understanding. Understanding of these matters comes very slowly, if atall. Of course, one does get better able to know what is going to happen in aquantum-mechanical situation—if that is what understanding means—but onenever gets a comfortable feeling that these quantum-mechanical rules are「natural.」Of course they are, but they are not natural to our own experience at an ordinarylevel. We should explain that the attitude that we are going to take with regardto this rule about angular momentum is quite diﬀerent from many of the otherthings we have talked about. We are not going to try to「explain」it, but we mustat least tell you what happens; it would be dishonest to describe the magneticproperties of materials without mentioning the fact that the classical descriptionof magnetism—of angular momentum and magnetic moments—is incorrect.

One of the most shocking and disturbing features about quantum mechanicsis that if you take the angular momentum along any particular axis you ﬁnd thatit is always an integer or half-integer times . This is so no matter which axisyou take. The subtleties involved in that curious fact—that you can take anyother axis and ﬁnd that the component for it is also locked to the same set ofvalues—we will leave to a later chapter, when you will experience the delight ofseeing how this apparent paradox is ultimately resolved.

We will now just accept the fact that for every atomic system there is anumber j, called the spin of the system—which must be an integer or a half-integer—and that the component of the angular momentum along any particularaxis will always have one of the following values between +j and −j:

We have also mentioned that every simple atomic system has a magneticmoment which has the same direction as the angular momentum. This is truenot only for atoms and nuclei but also for the fundamental particles. Eachfundamental particle has its own characteristic value of j and its magnetic35-1

What we mean by「the magneticmoment」in this statement is that the energy of the system in a magnetic ﬁeld,say in the z-direction, can be written as −µzB for small magnetic ﬁelds. Wemust have the condition that the ﬁeld should not be too great, otherwise it coulddisturb the internal motions of the system and the energy would not be a measureof the magnetic moment that was there before the ﬁeld was turned on. But ifthe ﬁeld is suﬃciently weak, the ﬁeld changes the energy by the amount

with the understanding that in this equation we are to replace µz by

Jz,

2mwhere Jz has one of the values in Eq. (35.1).Suppose we take a system with a spin j = 3/2. Without a magnetic ﬁeld,the system has four diﬀerent possible states corresponding to the diﬀerent valuesof Jz, all of which have exactly the same energy. But the moment we turn onthe magnetic ﬁeld, there is an additional energy of interaction which separatesthese states into four slightly diﬀerent energy levels. The energies of these levelsare given by a certain energy proportional to B, multiplied by  times 3/2, 1/2,−1/2, and −3/2—the values of Jz. The splitting of the energy levels for atomicsystems with spins of 1/2, 1, and 3/2 are shown in the diagrams of Fig. 35-1.(Remember that for any arrangement of electrons the magnetic moment is alwaysdirected opposite to the angular momentum.)

You will notice from the diagrams that the「center of gravity」of the energylevels is the same with and without a magnetic ﬁeld. Also notice that the spacingsfrom one level to the next are always equal for a given particle in a given magneticﬁeld. We are going to write the energy spacing, for a given magnetic ﬁeld B,as ωp—which is just a deﬁnition of ωp. Using Eqs. (35.2) and (35.3), we have

(35.4)35-2

The quantity g(q/2m) is just the ratio of the magnetic moment to the angularmomentum—it is a property of the particle. Equation (35.4) is the same formulathat we got in Chapter 34 for the angular velocity of precession in a magneticﬁeld, for a gyroscope whose angular momentum is J and whose magnetic momentis µ.

Fig. 35-2. The experiment of Stern and Gerlach.

35-2 The Stern-Gerlach experimentThe fact that the angular momentum is quantized is such a surprising thingthat we will talk a little bit about it historically. It was a shock from the momentit was discovered (although it was expected theoretically). It was ﬁrst observedin an experiment done in 1922 by Stern and Gerlach.If you wish, you canconsider the experiment of Stern-Gerlach as a direct justiﬁcation for a belief inthe quantization of angular momentum. Stern and Gerlach devised an experimentfor measuring the magnetic moment of individual silver atoms. They produced abeam of silver atoms by evaporating silver in a hot oven and letting some of themcome out through a series of small holes. This beam was directed between thepole tips of a special magnet, as shown in Fig. 35-2. Their idea was the following.If the silver atom has a magnetic moment µ, then in a magnetic ﬁeld B it hasan energy −µzB, where z is the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. In the classicaltheory, µz would be equal to the magnetic moment times the cosine of the anglebetween the moment and the magnetic ﬁeld, so the extra energy in the ﬁeldwould be

∆U = −µB cos θ.

(35.5)Of course, as the atoms come out of the oven, their magnetic moments wouldpoint in every possible direction, so there would be all values of θ. Now if themagnetic ﬁeld varies very rapidly with z—if there is a strong ﬁeld gradient—thenthe magnetic energy will also vary with position, and there will be a force on themagnetic moments whose direction will depend on whether cosine θ is positiveor negative. The atoms will be pulled up or down by a force proportional to thederivative of the magnetic energy; from the principle of virtual work,

Fz = − ∂U∂z

= µ cos θ

∂B∂z

.

(35.6)

Stern and Gerlach made their magnet with a very sharp edge on one of the poletips in order to produce a very rapid variation of the magnetic ﬁeld. The beamof silver atoms was directed right along this sharp edge, so that the atoms wouldfeel a vertical force in the inhomogeneous ﬁeld. A silver atom with its magneticmoment directed horizontally would have no force on it and would go straight pastthe magnet. An atom whose magnetic moment was exactly vertical would have aforce pulling it up toward the sharp edge of the magnet. An atom whose magneticmoment was pointed downward would feel a downward push. Thus, as they left the35-3

magnet, the atoms would be spread out according to their vertical components ofmagnetic moment. In the classical theory all angles are possible, so that when thesilver atoms are collected by deposition on a glass plate, one should expect a smearof silver along a vertical line. The height of the line would be proportional to themagnitude of the magnetic moment. The abject failure of classical ideas was com-pletely revealed when Stern and Gerlach saw what actually happened. They foundon the glass plate two distinct spots. The silver atoms had formed two beams.That a beam of atoms whose spins would apparently be randomly orientedgets split up into two separate beams is most miraculous. How does the magneticmoment know that it is only allowed to take on certain components in the directionof the magnetic ﬁeld? Well, that was really the beginning of the discovery of thequantization of angular momentum, and instead of trying to give you a theoreticalexplanation, we will just say that you are stuck with the result of this experimentjust as the physicists of that day had to accept the result when the experimentwas done. It is an experimental fact that the energy of an atom in a magneticﬁeld takes on a series of individual values. For each of these values the energyis proportional to the ﬁeld strength. So in a region where the ﬁeld varies, theprinciple of virtual work tells us that the possible magnetic force on the atomswill have a set of separate values; the force is diﬀerent for each state, so the beamof atoms is split into a small number of separate beams. From a measurement ofthe deﬂection of the beams, one can ﬁnd the strength of the magnetic moment.

35-3 The Rabi molecular-beam methodWe would now like to describe an improved apparatus for the measurementof magnetic moments which was developed by I. I. Rabi and his collaborators.In the Stern-Gerlach experiment the deﬂection of atoms is very small, and themeasurement of the magnetic moment is not very precise. Rabi’s techniquepermits a fantastic precision in the measurement of the magnetic moments. Themethod is based on the fact that the original energy of the atoms in a magneticﬁeld is split up into a ﬁnite number of energy levels. That the energy of an atomin the magnetic ﬁeld can have only certain discrete energies is really not moresurprising than the fact that atoms in general have only certain discrete energylevels—something we mentioned often in Volume I. Why should the same thingnot hold for atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld? It does. But it is the attempt to correlatethis with the idea of an oriented magnetic moment that brings out some of thestrange implications of quantum mechanics.

When an atom has two levels which diﬀer in energy by the amount ∆U, itcan make a transition from the upper level to the lower level by emitting a lightquantum of frequency ω, where

ω = ∆U.

(35.7)

The same thing can happen with atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld. Only then, the energydiﬀerences are so small that the frequency does not correspond to light, but to mi-crowaves or to radiofrequencies. The transitions from the lower energy level to anupper energy level of an atom can also take place with the absorption of light or, inthe case of atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld, by the absorption of microwave energy. Thusif we have an atom in a magnetic ﬁeld, we can cause transitions from one state toanother by applying an additional electromagnetic ﬁeld of the proper frequency.In other words, if we have an atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld and we「tickle」theatom with a weak varying electromagnetic ﬁeld, there will be a certain probabilityof knocking it to another level if the frequency is near to the ω in Eq. (35.7). Foran atom in a magnetic ﬁeld, this frequency is just what we have earlier called ωpand it is given in terms of the magnetic ﬁeld by Eq. (35.4). If the atom is tickledwith the wrong frequency, the chance of causing a transition is very small. Thusthere is a sharp resonance at ωp in the probability of causing a transition. Bymeasuring the frequency of this resonance in a known magnetic ﬁeld B, we canmeasure the quantity g(q/2m)—and hence the g-factor—with great precision.35-4

It is interesting that one comes to the same conclusion from a classical pointof view. According to the classical picture, when we place a small gyroscopewith a magnetic moment µ and an angular momentum J in an external magneticﬁeld, the gyroscope will precess about an axis parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld.(See Fig. 35-3.) Suppose we ask: How can we change the angle of the classicalgyroscope with respect to the ﬁeld—namely, with respect to the z-axis? Themagnetic ﬁeld produces a torque around a horizontal axis. Such a torque youwould think is trying to line up the magnet with the ﬁeld, but it only causesthe precession. If we want to change the angle of the gyroscope with respect tothe z-axis, we must exert a torque on it about the z-axis. If we apply a torquewhich goes in the same direction as the precession, the angle of the gyroscopewill change to give a smaller component of J in the z-direction. In Fig. 35-3, theangle between J and the z-axis would increase. If we try to hinder the precession,J moves toward the vertical.

For our precessing atom in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, how can we apply thekind of torque we want? The answer is: with a weak magnetic ﬁeld from theside. You might at ﬁrst think that the direction of this magnetic ﬁeld would haveto rotate with the precession of the magnetic moment, so that it was always atright angles to the moment, as indicated by the ﬁeld B0 in Fig. 35-4(a). Sucha ﬁeld works very well, but an alternating horizontal ﬁeld is almost as good. Ifwe have a small horizontal ﬁeld B0, which is always in the x-direction (plus orminus) and which oscillates with the frequency ωp, then on each one-half cyclethe torque on the magnetic moment reverses, so that it has a cumulative eﬀectwhich is almost as eﬀective as a rotating magnetic ﬁeld. Classically, then, wewould expect the component of the magnetic moment along the z-direction tochange if we have a very weak oscillating magnetic ﬁeld at a frequency which isexactly ωp. Classically, of course, µz would change continuously, but in quantummechanics the z-component of the magnetic moment cannot adjust continuously.It must jump suddenly from one value to another. We have made the comparisonbetween the consequences of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics to giveyou some clue as to what might happen classically and how it is related to whatactually happens in quantum mechanics. You will notice, incidentally, that theexpected resonant frequency is the same in both cases.

One additional remark: From what we have said about quantum mechanics,there is no apparent reason why there couldn’t also be transitions at the fre-quency 2ωp. It happens that there isn’t any analog of this in the classical case,and also it doesn’t happen in the quantum theory either—at least not for theparticular method of inducing the transitions that we have described. With anoscillating horizontal magnetic ﬁeld, the probability that a frequency 2ωp wouldcause a jump of two steps at once is zero. It is only at the frequency ωp thattransitions, either upward or downward, are likely to occur.Now we are ready to describe Rabi’s method for measuring magnetic moments.We will consider here only the operation for atoms with a spin of 1/2. A diagramof the apparatus is shown in Fig. 35-5. There is an oven which gives out a streamof neutral atoms which passes down a line of three magnets. Magnet 1 is just

Fig. 35-3. The classical precession of anatom with the magnetic moment µ and theangular momentum J.

like the one in Fig. 35-2, and has a ﬁeld with a strong ﬁeld gradient—say, with∂Bz/∂z positive. If the atoms have a magnetic moment, they will be deﬂecteddownward if Jz = +/2, or upward if Jz = −/2 (since for electrons µ is directedopposite to J). If we consider only those atoms which can get through the slit S1,there are two possible trajectories, as shown. Atoms with Jz = +/2 must goalong curve a to get through the slit, and those with Jz = −/2 must go alongcurve b. Atoms which start out from the oven along other paths will not getthrough the slit.Magnet 2 has a uniform ﬁeld. There are no forces on the atoms in this region,so they go straight through and enter magnet 3. Magnet 3 is just like magnet 1but with the ﬁeld inverted, so that ∂Bz/∂z has the opposite sign. The atomswith Jz = +/2 (we say「with spin up」), that felt a downward push in magnet 1,get an upward push in magnet 3; they continue on the path a and go throughslit S2 to a detector. The atoms with Jz = −/2 (「with spin down」) also haveopposite forces in magnets 1 and 3 and go along the path b, which also takesthem through slit S2 to the detector.The detector may be made in various ways, depending on the atom beingmeasured. For example, for atoms of an alkali metal like sodium, the detectorcan be a thin, hot tungsten wire connected to a sensitive current meter. Whensodium atoms land on the wire, they are evaporated oﬀ as Na+ ions, leaving anelectron behind. There is a current from the wire proportional to the number ofsodium atoms arriving per second.

In the gap of magnet 2 there is a set of coils that produces a small horizontalmagnetic ﬁeld B0. The coils are driven with a current which oscillates at a variablefrequency ω. So between the poles of magnet 2 there is a strong, constant, verticalﬁeld B0 and a weak, oscillating, horizontal ﬁeld B0.Suppose now that the frequency ω of the oscillating ﬁeld is set at ωp—the「precession」frequency of the atoms in the ﬁeld B. The alternating ﬁeld willcause some of the atoms passing by to make transitions from one Jz to theother. An atom whose spin was initially「up」(Jz = +/2) may be ﬂipped「down」(Jz = −/2). Now this atom has the direction of its magnetic moment reversed,so it will feel a downward force in magnet 3 and will move along the path a0,shown in Fig. 35-5. It will no longer get through the slit S2 to the detector.Similarly, some of the atoms whose spins were initially down (Jz = −/2) willhave their spins ﬂipped up (Jz = +/2) as they pass through magnet 2. Theywill then go along the path b0 and will not get to the detector.If the oscillating ﬁeld B0 has a frequency appreciably diﬀerent from ωp, itwill not cause any spin ﬂips, and the atoms will follow their undisturbed pathsto the detector. So you can see that the「precession」frequency ωp of the atomsin the ﬁeld B0 can be found by varying the frequency ω of the ﬁeld B0 until adecrease is observed in the current of atoms arriving at the detector. A decreasein the current will occur when ω is「in resonance」with ωp. A plot of the detectorcurrent as a function of ω might look like the one shown in Fig. 35-6. Knowingωp, we can obtain the g-value of the atom.Such atomic-beam or, as they are usually called,「molecular」beam resonanceexperiments are a beautiful and delicate way of measuring the magnetic propertiesof atomic objects. The resonance frequency ωp can be determined with greatprecision—in fact, with a greater precision than we can measure the magneticﬁeld B0, which we must know to ﬁnd g.

35-4 The paramagnetism of bulk materialsWe would like now to describe the phenomenon of the paramagnetism of bulkmaterials. Suppose we have a substance whose atoms have permanent magneticmoments, for example a crystal like copper sulfate. In the crystal there are copperions whose inner electron shells have a net angular momentum and a net magneticmoment. So the copper ion is an object which has a permanent magnetic moment.Let’s say just a word about which atoms have magnetic moments and which onesdon’t. Any atom, like sodium for instance, which has an odd number of electrons,35-6

Fig. 35-6. The current of atoms in the

beam decreases when ω = ωp.

will have a magnetic moment. Sodium has one electron in its unﬁlled shell. Thiselectron gives the atom a spin and a magnetic moment. Ordinarily, however,when compounds are formed the extra electrons in the outside shell are coupledtogether with other electrons whose spin directions are exactly opposite, so thatall the angular momenta and magnetic moments of the valence electrons usuallycancel out. That’s why, in general, molecules do not have a magnetic moment.Of course if you have a gas of sodium atoms, there is no such cancellation.* Also,if you have what is called in chemistry a「free radical」—an object with an oddnumber of valence electrons—then the bonds are not completely satisﬁed, andthere is a net angular momentum.

In most bulk materials there is a net magnetic moment only if there are atomspresent whose inner electron shell is not ﬁlled. Then there can be a net angularmomentum and a magnetic moment. Such atoms are found in the「transitionelement」part of the periodic table—for instance, chromium, manganese, iron,nickel, cobalt, palladium, and platinum are elements of this kind. Also, all of therare earth elements have unﬁlled inner shells and permanent magnetic moments.There are a couple of other strange things that also happen to have magneticmoments, such as liquid oxygen, but we will leave it to the chemistry departmentto explain the reason.

Now suppose that we have a box full of atoms or molecules with permanentmoments—say a gas, or a liquid, or a crystal. We would like to know whathappens if we apply an external magnetic ﬁeld. With no magnetic ﬁeld, theatoms are kicked around by the thermal motions, and the moments wind uppointing in all directions. But when there is a magnetic ﬁeld, it acts to line upthe little magnets; then there are more moments lying toward the ﬁeld than awayfrom it. The material is「magnetized.」

M = Nhµiav.

We deﬁne the magnetization M of a material as the net magnetic momentper unit volume, by which we mean the vector sum of all the atomic magneticmoments in a unit volume. If there are N atoms per unit volume and theiraverage moment is hµiav then M can be written as N times the average atomicmoment:(35.8)The deﬁnition of M corresponds to the deﬁnition of the electric polarization Pof Chapter 10.The classical theory of paramagnetism is just like the theory of the dielectricconstant we showed you in Chapter 11. One assumes that each of the atoms has amagnetic moment µ, which always has the same magnitude but which can pointin any direction. In a ﬁeld B, the magnetic energy is −µ· B = −µB cos θ, whereθ is the angle between the moment and the ﬁeld. From statistical mechanics, therelative probability of having any angle is e−energy/kT , so angles near zero aremore likely than angles near π. Proceeding exactly as we did in Section 11-3,we ﬁnd that for small magnetic ﬁelds M is directed parallel to B and has themagnitude

M = N µ2B3kT

.

(35.9)[See Eq. (11.20).] This approximate formula is correct only for µB/kT much lessthan one.We ﬁnd that the induced magnetization—the magnetic moment per unitvolume—is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is the phenomenon ofparamagnetism. You will see that the eﬀect is stronger at lower temperatures andweaker at higher temperatures. When we put a ﬁeld on a substance, it develops,for small ﬁelds, a magnetic moment proportional to the ﬁeld. The ratio of Mto B (for small ﬁelds) is called the magnetic susceptibility.Now we want to look at paramagnetism from the point of view of quantummechanics. We take ﬁrst the case of an atom with a spin of 1/2. In the absenceof a magnetic ﬁeld the atoms have a certain energy, but in a magnetic ﬁeld there

To save writing, let’s set

then

∆U = ±µ0B.

(35.13)The meaning of µ0 is clear: −µ0 is the z-component of the magnetic moment inthe up-spin case, and +µ0 is the z-component of the magnetic moment in thedown-spin case.Now statistical mechanics tells us that the probability that an atom is in one

state or another is proportional to

e−(Energy of state)/kT .

With no magnetic ﬁeld the two states have the same energy; so when there isequilibrium in a magnetic ﬁeld, the probabilities are proportional to

e−∆U/kT .

The number of atoms per unit volume with spin up is

Nup = ae−µ0B/kT ,

and the number with spin down is

The constant a is to be determined so that

Ndown = ae+µ0B/kT .

Nup + Ndown = N,

the total number of atoms per unit volume. So we get that

a =

(35.18)

What we are interested in is the average magnetic moment along the z-axis.The atoms with spin up will contribute a moment of −µ0, and those with spindown will have a moment of +µ0; so the average moment is

hµiav = Nup(−µ0) + Ndown(+µ0)

(35.19)The magnetic moment per unit volume M is then Nhµiav. Using Eqs. (35.15),

(35.16), and (35.17), we get that

M = N µ0

e+µ0B/kT − e−µ0B/kTe+µ0B/kT + e−µ0B/kT

(35.20)

This is the quantum-mechanical formula for M for atoms with j = 1/2. Inciden-tally, this formula can also be written somewhat more concisely in terms of thehyperbolic tangent function:

M = N µ0 tanh µ0BkT

.

(35.21)

35-8

Fig. 35-7. The variation of the paramag-netic magnetization with the magnetic ﬁeldstrength B.

A plot of M as a function of B is given in Fig. 35-7. When B gets very large,the hyperbolic tangent approaches 1, and M approaches the limiting value N µ0.So at high ﬁelds, the magnetization saturates. We can see why that is; at highenough ﬁelds the moments are all lined up in the same direction. In other words,they are all in the spin-down state, and each atom contributes the moment µ0.In most normal cases—say, for typical moments, room temperatures, and theﬁelds one can normally get (like 10,000 gauss)—the ratio µ0B/kT is about 0.002.One must go to very low temperatures to see the saturation. For normal temper-atures, we can usually replace tanh x by x, and write

M = N µ20B

kT

.

(35.22)

Just as we saw in the classical theory, M is proportional to B. In fact, theformula is almost exactly the same, except that there seems to be a factor of 1/3missing. But we still need to relate the µ0 in our quantum formula to the µ thatappears in the classical result, Eq. (35.9).In the classical formula, what appears is µ2 = µ · µ, the square of the vector

or in terms of µ0, deﬁned in Eq. (35.12), we get

Substituting this for µ2 in the classical formula, Eq. (35.9), does indeed reproducethe correct quantum formula, Eq. (35.22).The quantum theory of paramagnetism is easily extended to atoms of any

spin j. The low-ﬁeld magnetization is

is a combination of constants with the dimensions of a magnetic moment. Mostatoms have moments of roughly this size. It is called the Bohr magneton. Thespin magnetic moment of the electron is almost exactly one Bohr magneton.

35-5 Cooling by adiabatic demagnetizationThere is a very interesting special application of paramagnetism. At very lowtemperatures it is possible to line up the atomic magnets in a strong ﬁeld. Itis then possible to get down to extremely low temperatures by a process calledadiabatic demagnetization. We can take a paramagnetic salt (for example, onecontaining a number of rare-earth atoms like praseodymium-ammonium-nitrate),and start by cooling it down with liquid helium to one or two degrees absolute ina strong magnetic ﬁeld. Then the factor µB/kT is larger than 1—say more like2 or 3. Most of the spins are lined up, and the magnetization is nearly saturated.35-9

Let’s say, to make it easy, that the ﬁeld is very powerful and the temperatureis very low, so that nearly all the atoms are lined up. Then you isolate the saltthermally (say, by removing the liquid helium and leaving a good vacuum) andturn oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld. The temperature of the salt goes way down.

Now if you were to turn oﬀ the ﬁeld suddenly, the jiggling and shaking,of the atoms in the crystal lattice would gradually knock all the spins out ofalignment. Some of them would be up and some down. But if there is no ﬁeld(and disregarding the interactions between the atomic magnets, which will makeonly a slight error), it takes no energy to turn over the atomic magnets. Theycould randomize their spins without any energy change and, therefore, withoutany temperature change.

Suppose, however, that while the atomic magnets are being ﬂipped over bythe thermal motion there is still some magnetic ﬁeld present. Then it requiressome work to ﬂip them over opposite to the ﬁeld—they must do work against theﬁeld. This takes energy from the thermal motions and lowers the temperature.So if the strong magnetic ﬁeld is not removed too rapidly, the temperature ofthe salt will decrease—it is cooled by the demagnetization. From the quantum-mechanical view, when the ﬁeld is strong all the atoms are in the lowest state,because the odds against any being in the upper state are impossibly big. But asthe ﬁeld is lowered, it gets more and more likely that thermal ﬂuctuations willknock an atom into the upper state. When that happens, the atom absorbs theenergy ∆U = µ0B. So if the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ slowly, the magnetic transitionscan take energy out of the thermal vibrations of the crystal, cooling it oﬀ. It ispossible in this way to go from a temperature of a few degrees absolute down toa temperature of a few thousandths of a degree.

Would you like to make something even colder than that? It turns out thatNature has provided a way. We have already mentioned that there are alsomagnetic moments for the atomic nuclei. Our formulas for paramagnetism workjust as well for nuclei, except that the moments of nuclei are roughly a thousandtimes smaller.[They are of the order of magnitude of q/2mp, where mp isthe proton mass, so they are smaller by the ratio of the masses of the electronand proton.] With such magnetic moments, even at a temperature of 2◦K, thefactor µB/kT is only a few parts in a thousand. But if we use the paramagneticdemagnetization process to get down to a temperature of a few thousandths ofa degree, µB/kT becomes a number near 1—at these low temperatures we canbegin to saturate the nuclear moments. That is good luck, because we can thenuse the adiabatic demagnetization of the nuclear magnetism to reach still lowertemperatures. Thus it is possible to do two stages of magnetic cooling. First weuse adiabatic demagnetization of paramagnetic ions to reach a few thousandthsof a degree. Then we use the cold paramagnetic salt to cool some material whichhas a strong nuclear magnetism. Finally, when we remove the magnetic ﬁeldfrom this material, its temperature will go down to within a millionth of a degreeof absolute zero—if we have done everything very carefully.

35-6 Nuclear magnetic resonanceWe have said that atomic paramagnetism is very small and that nuclearmagnetism is even a thousand times smaller. Yet it is relatively easy to observethe nuclear magnetism by the phenomenon of「nuclear magnetic resonance.」Suppose we take a substance like water, in which all of the electron spins areexactly balanced so that their net magnetic moment is zero. The moleculeswill still have a very, very tiny magnetic moment due to the nuclear magneticmoment of the hydrogen nuclei. Suppose we put a small sample of water in amagnetic ﬁeld B. Since the protons (of the hydrogen) have a spin of 1/2, theywill have two possible energy states. If the water is in thermal equilibrium, therewill be slightly more protons in the lower energy states—with their momentsdirected parallel to the ﬁeld. There is a small net magnetic moment per unitvolume. Since the proton moment is only about one-thousandth of an atomicmoment, the magnetization which goes as µ2—using Eq. (35.22)—is only about35-10

one-millionth as strong as typical atomic paramagnetism. (That’s why we haveto pick a material with no atomic magnetism.) If you work it out, the diﬀerencebetween the number of protons with spin up and with spin down is only one partin 108, so the eﬀect is indeed very small! It can still be observed, however, in thefollowing way.

Suppose we surround the water sample with a small coil that produces a smallhorizontal oscillating magnetic ﬁeld. If this ﬁeld oscillates at the frequency ωp,it will induce transitions between the two energy states—just as we describedfor the Rabi experiment in Section 35-3. When a proton ﬂips from an upperenergy state to a lower one, it will give up the energy µzB which, as we haveseen, is equal to ωp. If it ﬂips from the lower energy state to the upper one, itwill absorb the energy ωp from the coil. Since there are slightly more protons inthe lower state than in the upper one, there will be a net absorption of energyfrom the coil. Although the eﬀect is very small, the slight energy absorption canbe seen with a sensitive electronic ampliﬁer.

Just as in the Rabi molecular-beam experiment, the energy absorption will

be seen only when the oscillating ﬁeld is in resonance, that is, when

(cid:19)

B.

It is often more convenient to search for the resonance by varying B while keepingω ﬁxed. The energy absorption will evidently appear when

B = 2mp

ω.

A typical nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus is shown in Fig. 35-8. Ahigh-frequency oscillator drives a small coil placed between the poles of a largeelectromagnet. Two small auxiliary coils around the pole tips are driven witha 60-cycle current so that the magnetic ﬁeld is「wobbled」about its averagevalue by a very small amount. As an example, say that the main current of themagnet is set to give a ﬁeld of 5000 gauss, and the auxiliary coils produce avariation of ±1 gauss about this value. If the oscillator is set at 21.2 megacyclesper second, it will then be at the proton resonance each time the ﬁeld sweepsthrough 5000 gauss [using Eq. (34.13) with g = 5.58 for the proton].The circuit of the oscillator is arranged to give an additional output signalproportional to any change in the power being absorbed from the oscillator. Thissignal is fed to the vertical deﬂection ampliﬁer of an oscilloscope. The horizontalsweep of the oscilloscope is triggered once during each cycle of the ﬁeld-wobblingfrequency. (More usually, the horizontal deﬂection is made to follow in proportionto the wobbling ﬁeld.)

Before the water sample is placed inside the high-frequency coil, the powerdrawn from the oscillator is some value. (It doesn’t change with the magneticﬁeld.) When a small bottle of water is placed in the coil, however, a signal appearson the oscilloscope, as shown in the ﬁgure. We see a picture of the power beingabsorbed by the ﬂipping over of the protons!

In practice, it is diﬃcult to know how to set the main magnet to exactly5000 gauss. What one does is to adjust the main magnet current until theresonance signal appears on the oscilloscope. It turns out that this is now themost convenient way to make an accurate measurement of the strength of amagnetic ﬁeld. Of course, at some time someone had to measure accurately themagnetic ﬁeld and frequency to determine the g-value of the proton. But nowthat this has been done, a proton resonance apparatus like that of the ﬁgure canbe used as a「proton resonance magnetometer.」

We should say a word about the shape of the signal. If we were to wobblethe magnetic ﬁeld very slowly, we would expect to see a normal resonance curve.The energy absorption would read a maximum when ωp arrived exactly at theoscillator frequency. There would be some absorption at nearby frequenciesbecause all the protons are not in exactly the same ﬁeld—and diﬀerent ﬁeldsmean slightly diﬀerent resonant frequencies.

35-11

apparatus.

One might wonder, incidentally, whether at the resonance frequency we shouldsee any signal at all. Shouldn’t we expect the high-frequency ﬁeld to equalize thepopulations of the two states—so that there should be no signal except when thewater is ﬁrst put in? Not exactly, because although we are trying to equalize thetwo populations, the thermal motions on their part are trying to keep the properratios for the temperature T. If we sit at the resonance, the power being absorbedby the nuclei is just what is being lost to the thermal motions. There is, however,relatively little「thermal contact」between the proton magnetic moments andthe atomic motions. The protons are relatively isolated down in the center of theelectron distributions. So in pure water, the resonance signal is, in fact, usuallytoo small to be seen. To increase the absorption, it is necessary to increase the「thermal contact.」This is usually done by adding a little iron oxide to the water.The iron atoms are like small magnets; as they jiggle around in their thermaldance, they make tiny jiggling magnetic ﬁelds at the protons. These varyingﬁelds「couple」the proton magnets to the atomic vibrations and tend to establishthermal equilibrium. It is through this「coupling」that protons in the higherenergy states can lose their energy so that they are again capable of absorbingenergy from the oscillator.

In practice the output signal of a nuclear resonance apparatus does not looklike a normal resonance curve. It is usually a more complicated signal withoscillations—like the one drawn in the ﬁgure. Such signal shapes appear becauseof the changing ﬁelds. The explanation should be given in terms of quantummechanics, but it can be shown that in such experiments the classical ideas ofprecessing moments always give the correct answer. Classically, we would saythat when we arrive at resonance we start driving a lot of the precessing nuclearmagnets synchronously. In so doing, we make them precess together. Thesenuclear magnets, all rotating together, will set up an induced emf in the oscillatorcoil at the frequency ωp. But because the magnetic ﬁeld is increasing with time,the precession frequency is increasing also, and the induced voltage is soon at afrequency a little higher than the oscillator frequency. As the induced emf goesalternately in phase and out of phase with the oscillator, the「absorbed」powergoes alternately positive and negative. So on the oscilloscope we see the beatnote between the proton frequency and the oscillator frequency. Because theproton frequencies are not all identical (diﬀerent protons are in slightly diﬀerentﬁelds) and also possibly because of the disturbance from the iron oxide in thewater, the freely precessing moments soon get out of phase, and the beat signaldisappears.

These phenomena of magnetic resonance have been put to use in many waysas tools for ﬁnding out new things about matter—especially in chemistry andnuclear physics. It goes without saying that the numerical values of the magneticmoments of nuclei tell us something about their structure. In chemistry, much hasbeen learned from the structure (or shape) of the resonances. Because of magneticﬁelds produced by nearby nuclei, the exact position of a nuclear resonance isshifted somewhat, depending on the environment in which any particular nucleusﬁnds itself. Measuring these shifts helps determine which atoms are near whichother ones and helps to elucidate the details of the structure of molecules. Equallyimportant is the electron spin resonance of free radicals. Although not present toany very large extent in equilibrium, such radicals are often intermediate statesof chemical reactions. A measurement of an electron spin resonance is a delicatetest for the presence of free radicals and is often the key to understanding themechanism of certain chemical reactions.

Ferromagnetism

36-1 Magnetization currentsIn

this chapter we will discuss some materials in which the net eﬀect ofthe magnetic moments in the material is much greater than in the case ofparamagnetism or diamagnetism. The phenomenon is called ferromagnetism.In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials the induced magnetic moments areusually so weak that we don’t have to worry about the additional ﬁelds producedby the magnetic moments. For ferromagnetic materials, however, the magneticmoments induced by applied magnetic ﬁelds are quite enormous and have agreat eﬀect on the ﬁelds themselves. In fact, the induced moments are so strongthat they are often the dominant eﬀect in producing the observed ﬁelds. So oneof the things we will have to worry about is the mathematical theory of largeinduced magnetic moments. That is, of course, just a technical question. Thereal problem is, why are the magnetic moments so strong—how does it all work?We will come to that question in a little while.

Finding the magnetic ﬁelds of ferromagnetic materials is something like theproblem of ﬁnding the electrostatic ﬁeld in the presence of dielectrics. You willremember that we ﬁrst described the internal properties of a dielectric in termsof a vector ﬁeld P , the dipole moment per unit volume. Then we ﬁgured outthat the eﬀects of this polarization are equivalent to a charge density ρpol givenby the divergence of P :(36.1)The total charge in any situation can be written as the sum of this polarizationcharge plus all other charges, whose density we write* ρother. Then the Maxwellequation which relates the divergence of E to the charge density becomes

ρpol = −∇ · P .

We can then pull out the polarization part of the charge and put it on the otherside of the equation, to get the new law

∇ · (0E + P ) = ρother.

(36.2)The new law says the divergence of the quantity (0E + P ) is equal to the densityof the other charges.Pulling E and P together as in Eq. (36.2), of course, is useful only if we knowsome relation between them. We have seen that the theory which relates theinduced electric dipole moment to the ﬁeld was a relatively complicated businessand can really only be applied to certain simple situations, and even then as anapproximation. We would like to remind you of one of the approximate ideaswe used. To ﬁnd the induced dipole moment of an atom inside a dielectric, it isnecessary to know the electric ﬁeld that acts on an individual atom. We made theapproximation—which is not too bad in many cases—that the ﬁeld on the atomis the same as it would be at the center of the small hole which would be left ifwe took out the atom (keeping the dipole moments of all the neighboring atoms

the same). You will also remember that the electric ﬁeld in a hole in a polarizeddielectric depends on the shape of the hole. We summarize our earlier resultsin Fig. 36-1. For a thin, disc-shaped hole perpendicular to the polarization, theelectric ﬁeld in the hole is given by

Ehole = Edielectric + P0

,

which we showed by using Gauss’ law. On the other hand, in a needle-shaped slotparallel to the polarization, we showed—by using the fact that the curl of E iszero—that the electric ﬁelds inside and outside of the slot are the same. Finally,we found that for a spherical hole the electric ﬁeld was one-third of the waybetween the ﬁeld of the slot and the ﬁeld of the disc:

Ehole = Edielectric + 13

P0

(spherical hole).

(36.3)

This was the ﬁeld we used in thinking about what happens to an atom inside apolarized dielectric.

Now we have to discuss the analog of all this for the case of magnetism. Onesimple, short-cut way of doing this is to say the M, the magnetic moment perunit volume, is just like P , the electric dipole moment per unit volume, andthat, therefore, the negative of the divergence of M is equivalent to a「magneticcharge density」ρm—whatever that may mean. The trouble is, of course, thatthere isn’t any such thing as a「magnetic charge」in the physical world. As weknow, the divergence of B is always zero. But that does not stop us from makingan artiﬁcial analog and writing

∇ · M = −ρm,

(36.4)where it is to be understood that ρm is purely mathematical. Then we couldmake a complete analogy with the electrostatic case and use all our old equationsfrom electrostatics. People have often done something like that. In fact, histori-cally, people even believed that the analogy was right. They believed that thequantity ρm represented the density of「magnetic poles.」These days, however, weknow that the magnetization of materials comes from circulating currents withinthe atoms—either from the spinning electrons or from the motion of the electronsin the atom. It is therefore nicer from a physical point of view to describe thingsrealistically in terms of the atomic currents, rather than in terms of a densityof some mythical「magnetic poles.」Incidentally, these currents are sometimescalled「Ampèrian」currents, because Ampère ﬁrst suggested that the magnetismof matter came from circulating atomic currents.

The actual microscopic current density in magnetized matter is, of course,very complicated. Its value depends on where you look in the atom—it’s large insome places and small in others; it goes one way in one part of the atom andthe opposite way in another part (just as the microscopic electric ﬁeld variesenormously inside a dielectric). In many practical problems, however, we areinterested only in the ﬁelds outside of the matter or in the average magnetic ﬁeldinside of the matter—where we mean an average taken over many, many atoms.It is only for such macroscopic problems that it is convenient to describe themagnetic state of the matter in terms of M, the average dipole moment per unitvolume. What we want to show now is that the atomic currents of magnetizedmatter can give rise to certain large-scale currents which are related to M.What we are going to do, then, is to separate the current density j—which isthe real source of the magnetic ﬁelds—into various parts: one part to describethe circulating currents of the atomic magnets, and the other parts to describewhat other currents there may be. It is usually most convenient to separate thecurrents into three parts. In Chapter 32 we made a distinction between thecurrents which ﬂow freely on conductors and the ones which are due to the backand forth motions of the bound charges in dielectrics. In Section 32-2 we wrote

j = jpol + jother,

36-2

Fig. 36-1. The electric ﬁeld in a cavityin a dielectric depends on the shape of thecavity.

where jpol represented the currents from the motion of the bound charges indielectrics and jother took care of all other currents. Now we want to go further.We want to separate jother into one part, jmag, which describes the averagecurrents inside of magnetized materials, and an additional term which we cancall jcond for whatever is left over. The last term will generally refer to currentsin conductors, but it may also include other currents—for example the currentsfrom charges moving freely through empty space. So we will write for the totalcurrent density:

(36.5)Of course it is this total current which belongs in the Maxwell equation for thecurl of B:

j = jpol + jmag + jcond.

(36.6)Now we have to relate the current jmag to the magnetization vector M. Sothat you can see where we are going, we will tell you that the result is going tobe that

c2∇ × B = j0

+ ∂E∂t

.

jmag = ∇ × M .

(36.7)If we are given the magnetization vector M everywhere in a magnetic material,the circulation current density is given by the curl of M. Let’s see if we canunderstand why this is so.First, let’s take the case of a cylindrical rod which has a uniform magnetizationparallel to its axis. Physically, we know that such a uniform magnetization reallymeans a uniform density of atomic circulating currents everywhere inside thematerial. Suppose we try to imagine what the actual currents would look like ina cross section of the material. We would expect to see currents something likethose shown in Fig. 36-2. Each atomic current goes around and around in a littlecircle, with all the circulating currents going around in the same direction. Nowwhat is the eﬀective current of such a thing? Well, in most of the bar there is noeﬀect at all, because right next to each current there is another current goingin the opposite direction. If we imagine a small surface—but one still quite abit larger than a single atom—such as is indicated in Fig. 36-2 by the line AB,the net current through such a surface is zero. There is no net current anywhereinside the material. Note, however, that at the surface of the material there areatomic currents which are not cancelled by neighboring currents going the otherway. At the surface there is a net current always going in the same directionaround the rod. Now you see why we said earlier that a uniformly magnetizedrod is equivalent to a long solenoid carrying an electric current.

How does this view ﬁt with Eq. (36.7)? First, inside the material the mag-netization M is constant, so all its derivatives are zero. This agrees with ourgeometric picture. At the surface, however, M is not really constant—it isconstant up to the edge and then suddenly collapses to zero. So, right at thesurface there are terriﬁc gradients which, according to (36.7), will give a highcurrent density. Suppose we look at what happens near the point C in Fig. 36-2.Taking the x- and y-directions as in the ﬁgure, the magnetization M is in thez-direction. Writing out the components of Eq. (36.7), we have

∂Mz∂y− ∂Mz∂x

= (jmag)x,

= (jmag)y.

(36.8)

At the point C, the derivative ∂Mz/∂y is zero, but ∂Mz/∂x is large and positive.Equation (36.7) says that there is a large current density in the minus y-direction.This agrees with our picture of a surface current going around the bar.Now we want to ﬁnd the current density for a more complicated case in whichthe magnetization varies from point to point in a material. It is easy to seequalitatively that if the magnetization is diﬀerent in two neighboring regions,there will not be a perfect cancellation of the circulating currents so that there36-3

Fig. 36-2. Schematic diagram of the cir-culating atomic currents as seen in a crosssection of an iron rod magnetized in thez-direction.

will be a net current in the volume of the material. It is this eﬀect that we wantto work out quantitatively.

First, we need to recall the results of Section 14-5 that a circulating current I

has a magnetic moment µ given by

µ = IA,

(36.9)where A is the area of the current loop (see Fig. 36-3). Now let’s consider a smallrectangular block inside of a magnetized material, as sketched in Fig. 36-4. Wetake the block so small that we can consider that the magnetization is uniforminside it. If this block has a magnetization Mz in the z-direction, the net eﬀectwill be the same as a surface current going around on the vertical faces, as shown.We can ﬁnd the magnitude of these currents from Eq. (36.9). The total magneticmoment of the block is equal to the magnetization times the volume:

from which we get (remembering that the area of the loop is ac)

µ = Mz(abc),

I = Mzb.

In other words, the current per unit length (vertically) on each of the verticalsurfaces is equal to Mz.

Fig. 36-3. The dipole moment µ of a

current loop is IA.

Fig. 36-4. A small magnetized block isequivalent to a circulating surface current.

Fig. 36-5.

If the magnetization of twoneighboring blocks is not the same, there isa net surface current in between.

Now suppose that we imagine two such little blocks next to each other, asshown in Fig. 36-5. Because block 2 is slightly displaced from block 1, it will havea slightly diﬀerent vertical component of magnetization, which we call Mz +∆Mz.Now on the surface between the two blocks there will be two contributions to thetotal current. Block 1 will produce a current I1 ﬂowing in the positive y-direction,and block 2 will produce a surface current I2 ﬂowing in the negative y-direction.The total surface current in the positive y-direction is the sum:

I = I1 − I2 = Mzb − (Mz + ∆Mz)b= −∆Mzb.

We can write ∆Mz, as the derivative of Mz in the x-direction times the displace-ment from block 1 to block 2, which is just a:∆Mz = ∂Mz∂x

a.

The current ﬂowing between the two blocks is then

I = − ∂Mz∂x

ab.

To relate the current I to an average volume current density j, we must realizethat this current I is really spread over a certain cross-sectional area. If we36-4

imagine the whole volume of the material to be ﬁlled with such little blocks, onesuch side face (perpendicular to the x-axis) can be associated with each block.*Then we see that the area to be associated with the current I is just the area abof one of the front faces. We get the result

.

jy = Iab

= − ∂Mz∂xWe have at least the beginning of the curl of M.There should be another term in jy from the variation of the x-componentof the magnetization with z. This contribution to j will come from the surfacebetween two little blocks stacked one on top of the other, as shown in Fig. 36-6.Using the same arguments we have just made, you can show that this surfacewill contribute to jy the amount ∂Mx/∂z. These are the only surfaces which cancontribute to the y-component of the current so we have that the total currentdensity in the y-direction is

jy = ∂Mx∂z

− ∂Mz∂x

.

Working out the currents on the remaining faces of a cube—or using the factthat our z-direction is completely arbitrary—we can conclude that the vectorcurrent density is indeed given by the equationj = ∇ × M .

So if we choose to describe the magnetic situation in matter in terms ofthe average magnetic moment per unit volume M, we ﬁnd that the circulatingatomic currents are equivalent to an average current density in matter givenby Eq. (36.7). If the material is also a dielectric, there may be, in addition, apolarization current jpol = ∂P /∂t. And if the material is also a conductor, wemay have a conduction current jcond as well. We can write the total current as(36.10)

We can move the term in M to the left-hand side:

As we remarked in Chapter 32, many people like to write (E + P /0) as a newvector ﬁeld D/0. Similarly, it is often convenient to write (B − M /0c2) as asingle vector ﬁeld. We choose to deﬁne a new vector ﬁeld H by

It looks simple, but all the complexity is just hidden in the letters D and H.

* Or, if you prefer, the current I in each face should be split 50–50 with the blocks on the

two sides.

36-5

Now we have to give you a warning. Most people who use the mks units havechosen to use a diﬀerent deﬁnition of H. Calling their ﬁeld H0 (of course, theystill call it H without the prime), it is deﬁned byH0 = 0c2B − M .

(36.14)

(Also, they usually write 0c2 as a new number 1/µ0; then they have one moreconstant to keep track of!) With this deﬁnition, Eq. (36.13) looks even simpler:

∇ × H0 = jcond + ∂D∂t

.

(36.15)

But the diﬃculties with this deﬁnition of H0 are, ﬁrst, that it doesn’t agree withthe deﬁnition of people who don’t use the mks units, and second, that it makesH0 and B have diﬀerent units. We think it is more convenient for H to havethe same units as B—rather than the units of M, as H0 does. But if you aregoing to be an engineer and work on the design of transformers, magnets, andsuch, you will have to watch out. You will ﬁnd many books which use for H thedeﬁnition of Eq. (36.14) rather than our deﬁnition of Eq. (36.12), and many otherbooks—especially handbooks about magnetic materials—that relate B and Hthe way we have done. You’ll have to be careful to ﬁgure out which conventionthey are using.

One way to tell is by the units they use. Remember that in the mks system,B—and therefore our H—are measured with the unit: one weber per squaremeter, equal to 10,000 gauss. In the mks system, a magnetic moment (a currenttimes an area) has the unit: one ampere-meter2. The magnetization M, then,has the unit: one ampere per meter. For H0 the units are the same as for M.You can see that this also agrees with Eq. (36.15), since ∇ has the dimensionsof one over a length. People who are working with electromagnets also get inthe habit of calling the unit of H (with the H0 deﬁnition)「one ampere turnper meter」—thinking of the turns of wire on a winding. But a「turn」is really adimensionless number, so that doesn’t need to confuse you. Since our H is equalto H0/0c2, if you are using the mks system, H (in webers/meter2) is equal to4π × 10−7 times H0 (in amperes per meter). It is perhaps more convenient toremember that H (in gauss) = 0.0126H0 (in amp/meter).There is one more horrible thing. Many people who use our deﬁnition of Hhave decided to call the units of H and B by diﬀerent names! Even though theyhave the same dimensions, they call the unit of B one gauss, and the unit of Hone oersted (after Gauss and Oersted, of course). So, in many books you willﬁnd graphs with B plotted in gauss and H in oersteds. They are really the sameunit—10−4 of the mks unit. We have summarized the confusion about magneticunits in Table 36-1.

36-3 The magnetization curveNow we will look at some simple situations in which the magnetic ﬁeld isconstant, or in which the ﬁelds change slowly enough that we can neglect ∂D/∂tin comparison with jcond. Then the ﬁelds obey the equations

∇ · B = 0,

∇ × H = jcond/0c2,H = B − M /0c2.

(36.16)(36.17)(36.18)

Suppose we have a torus (a donut) of iron wrapped with a coil of copper wire,as shown in Fig. 36-7(a). A current I ﬂows in the wire. What is the magneticﬁeld? The magnetic ﬁeld will be mainly inside the iron; there, the lines of Bwill be circles, as drawn in Fig. 36-7(b). Since the ﬂux of B is continuous, itsdivergence is zero, and Eq. (36.16) is satisﬁed. Next, we write Eq. (36.17) in36-6

Table 36-1

where the integral of j is to be carried out over any surface S bounded by Γ.This surface is cut once by each turn of the winding. Each turn contributes thecurrent I to the integral, and, if there are N turns in all, the integral is N I.From the symmetry of our problem, B is the same all around the curve Γ; ifwe assume that the magnetization, and therefore, the ﬁeld H is also constantalong Γ, Eq. (36.19) becomes

Hl = N I0c2 ,

where l is the length of the curve Γ. So,H = 10c2

.

(36.20)

It is because H is directly proportional to the magnetizing current in cases likethis one that H is sometimes called the magnetizing ﬁeld.Now all we need is an equation which relates H to B. But there isn’t anysuch equation! There is, of course, Eq. (36.18), but it is no help because there isno direct relation between M and B for a ferromagnetic material like iron. Themagnetization M depends on the whole past history of the iron, and not onlyon what B is at the moment.All is not lost, though. We can get solutions in certain simple cases. If we startout with unmagnetized iron—let’s say with iron that has been annealed at hightemperatures—then in the simple geometry of the torus, all the iron will havethe same magnetic history. Then we can say something about M—and thereforeabout the relation between B and H—from experimental measurements. Theﬁeld H in the torus is, from Eq. (36.20), given as a constant times the current Iin the winding. The ﬁeld B can be measured by integrating over time the emf inthe coil (or in an extra coil wound over the magnetizing coil shown in the ﬁgure).This emf is equal to the rate of change of the ﬂux of B, so the integral of theemf with time is equal to B times the cross-sectional area of the torus.Figure 36-8 shows the relation between B and H, observed with a torus ofsoft iron. When the current is ﬁrst turned on, B increases with increasing Halong the curve a. Note the diﬀerent scales on B and H; initially, it takes onlya relatively small H to make a large B. Why is B so much larger with the ironthan it would be with air? Because there is a large magnetization M which isequivalent to a large surface current on the iron—the ﬁeld B comes from thesum of this current and the conduction current in the winding. Why M shouldbe so large, we will discuss later.At higher values of H, the magnetization curve levels oﬀ. We say that the ironsaturates. With the scales of our ﬁgure, the curve appears to become horizontal.Actually, it continues to rise slightly—for large ﬁelds, B becomes proportionalto H, and with a unit slope. There is no further increase of M. Incidentally, weshould point out that if the torus were made of some nonmagnetic material, Mwould be zero and B would equal H for all ﬁelds.The ﬁrst thing we notice is that curve a in Fig. 36-8—which is the so-calledmagnetization curve—is highly nonlinear. But it’s worse than that. If, afterreaching saturation, we decrease the current in the coil to bring H back to zero,the magnetic ﬁeld B falls along curve b. When H reaches zero, there is stillsome B left. Even with no magnetizing current there is a magnetic ﬁeld in theiron—it has become permanently magnetized. If we now turn on a negativecurrent in the coil, the B-H curve continues along b until the iron is saturated inthe negative direction. If we then bring the current back to zero again, B goesalong curve c. If we alternate the current between large positive and negativevalues, the B-H curve goes back and forth along very nearly the curves b and c.36-7

Fig. 36-8. Typical magnetization and hys-

teresis curve for soft iron.

If we vary H in some arbitrary way, however, we can get more complicated curveswhich will, in general, lie somewhere between the curves b and c. The loop madeby repeated oscillation of the ﬁelds is called a hysteresis loop of the iron.We see then that we cannot write a functional relationship like B = f(H),because the value of B at any instant depends not only on what H is at thattime, but on its whole past history. Naturally, the magnetization and hysteresiscurves are diﬀerent for diﬀerent substances. The shape of the curves dependscritically on the chemical composition of the material, and also on the details ofits preparation and subsequent physical treatment. We will discuss some of thephysical explanations for these complications in the next chapter.

36-4 Iron-core inductancesOne of the most important applications of magnetic materials is in electricalcircuits—for example, in transformers, electric motors, and so on. One reason isthat with iron we can control where the magnetic ﬁelds go, and also get muchlarger ﬁelds for a given electric current. For example, the typical「toroidal」inductance is made very much like the object shown in Fig. 36-7. For a giveninductance, it can be much smaller in volume and use much less copper than anequivalent「air-core」inductance. For a given inductance, we get a much smallerresistance in the winding, so the inductance is more nearly「ideal」—particularlyfor low frequencies. It is very easy to understand, qualitatively, how such aninductance works. If I is the current in the winding, then the ﬁeld H whichis produced in the inside is proportional to I—as given by Eq. (36.20). Thevoltage V across the terminals is related to the magnetic ﬁeld B. Neglectingthe resistance of the winding, the voltage V is proportional to ∂B/∂t. Theinductance L, which is the ratio of V to dI/dt (see Section 17-7), thus involvesthe relation between B and H in the iron. Since the B is so much bigger thanthe H, we get a large factor in the inductance. Physically, what happens is thata small current in the coil, which would ordinarily produce a small magnetic ﬁeld,causes the little「slave」magnets in the iron to line up and produce a tremendouslygreater「magnetic」current than the external current in the winding. It is as ifwe had a lot more current going through the coil than we really have. When wereverse the current, all the little magnets ﬂip over—all those internal currentsreverse—and we get a much higher induced emf than we would get without theiron. If we want to calculate the inductance, we can do so through the energy—asdescribed in Section 17-8. The rate at which energy is delivered from the currentsource is IV. The voltage V is the cross-sectional area A of the core, times N,times dB/dt. From Eq. (36.20), I = (0c2l/N)H. So we have

(36.22)

of H, the integral ofR H dB around one complete cycle is not equal to zero. It

An interesting feature is involved here. When we use alternating currents, theiron is driven around a hysteresis loop. Since B is not a single-valued functionis the area enclosed inside the hysteresis curve. Thus, the driving source deliversa certain net energy each cycle—an energy proportional to the area inside thehysteresis loop. And that energy is「lost.」It is lost from the electromagneticgoings on, but turns up as heat in the iron. It is called the hysteresis loss. Tokeep such energy losses small, we would like the hysteresis loop to be as narrow as36-8

possible. One way to decrease the area of the loop is to reduce the maximum ﬁeldthat is reached during each cycle. For smaller maximum ﬁelds, we get a hysteresiscurve like the one shown in Fig. 36-9. Also, special materials are designed tohave a very narrow loop. The so-called transformer irons—which are iron alloyswith a small amount of silicon—have been developed to have this property.When an inductance is run over a small hysteresis loop, the relationshipbetween B and H can be approximated by a linear equation. People usuallywrite(36.23)The constant µ is not the magnetic moment we have used before. It is called thepermeability of the iron. (It is also sometimes called the「relative permeability.」)The permeability of ordinary irons is typically several thousand. There are specialalloys alike「supermalloy」which can have permeabilities as high as a million.

B = µH.

If we use the approximation that B = µH in Eq. (36.21), we can write the

energy in a toroidal inductance as

U = (0c2lA)µ

H dH = (0c2lA) µH22 .

L = µN 2A0c2l

Using H/I from Eq. (36.20), we have

The inductance is proportional to µ. If you want inductances for such thingsas audio ampliﬁers, you will try to operate them on a hysteresis loop where theB-H relationship is as linear as possible. (You will remember that we spoke inChapter 50, Vol. I, about the generation of harmonics in nonlinear systems.) Forsuch purposes, Eq. (36.23) is a useful approximation. On the other hand, if youwant to generate harmonics, you may use an inductance which is intentionallyoperated in a highly nonlinear way. Then you will have to use the completeB-H curves, and analyze what happens by graphical or numerical methods.A「transformer」is often made by putting two coils on the same torus—orcore—of a magnetic material. (For the larger transformers, the core is made withrectangular proportions for convenience.) Then a varying current in the「primary」winding causes the magnetic ﬁeld in the core to change, which induces an emfin the「secondary」winding. Since the ﬂux through each turn of both windingsis the same, the emf’s in the two windings are in the same ratio as the numberof turns on each. A voltage applied to the primary is transformed to a diﬀerentvoltage at the secondary. Since a certain net current around the core is neededto produce the required change in the magnetic ﬁeld, the algebraic sum of thecurrents in the two windings will be ﬁxed and equal to the required「magnetizing」current. If the current drawn from the secondary increases, the primary currentmust increase in proportion—there is a「transformation」of currents as well asvoltage.

36-5 ElectromagnetsNow let’s discuss a practical situation which is a little more complicated. Sup-pose we have an electromagnet of the rather standard form shown in Fig. 36-10—there is a「C-shaped」yoke of iron, with a coil of many turns of wire wrappedaround the yoke. What is the magnetic ﬁeld B in the gap?

36-9

Fig. 36-10. An electromagnet.

Fig. 36-11. Cross section of an electromagnet.

If the gap thickness is small compared with all the other dimensions, we can,as a ﬁrst approximation, assume that the lines of B will go around through theloop, just as they did in the torus. They will look more or less as shown inFig. 36-11(a). They tend to spread out somewhat in the gap, but if the gap isnarrow, this will be a small eﬀect. It is a fair approximation to assume that theﬂux of B through any cross section of the yoke is a constant. If the yoke has auniform cross-sectional area A—and if we neglect any edge eﬀects at the gaps orat the corners—we can say that B is uniform around the yoke.Also, B will have the same value in the gap. This follows from Eq. (36.16).Imagine the closed surface S, shown in Fig. 36-11(b), which has one face in thegap and the other in the iron. The total ﬂux of B out of this surface must bezero. Calling B1 the ﬁeld in the gap and B2 the ﬁeld in the iron, we have (to ourapproximation) that

B1A − B2A = 0.

It follows that B1 = B2.Now let’s look at H. We can again use Eq. (36.19), taking the line integralaround the curve Γ in Fig. 36-11(b). As before, the integral on the right-handside is N I, the number of turns times the current. Now, however, H will bediﬀerent in the iron and in the air. Calling H2 the ﬁeld in the iron and l2 the pathlength around the yoke, this part of the curve will contribute the amount H2l2to the integral. Calling H1 the ﬁeld in the gap and l1 the gap thickness, we getthe contribution H1l1 from the gap. We have thatH1l1 + H2l2 = N I0c2 .

(36.26)

Now we know something else: that in the air gap, the magnetization is

negligible, so that B1 = H1. Since B1 = B2, Eq. (36.26) becomes

B2l1 + H2l2 = N I0c2 .

(36.27)

We still have two unknowns. To ﬁnd B2 and H2, we need another relationship—namely, the one which relates B to H in the iron.If we can make the approximation that B2 = µH2, we can solve the equationalgebraically. However, let’s do the general case, in which the magnetization curveof the iron is one like that shown in Fig. 36-8. What we want is the simultaneoussolution of this functional relationship together with Eq. (36.27). We can ﬁndit by plotting a graph of Eq. (36.27) on the same graph with the magnetizationcurve, as is done in Fig. 36-12. Where the two curves intersect, we have oursolution.

For a given current I, the function (36.27) is the straight line marked I > 0 inFig. 36-12. The line intersects the H-axis (B2 = 0) at H2 = N I/0c2l2, and the36-10

electromagnet.

slope is −l2/l1. Diﬀerent currents just shift the line horizontally. From Fig. 36-12,we see that for a given current there are several diﬀerent solutions, dependingon how you got there. If you have just built the magnet and turned the currentup to I, the ﬁeld B2 (which is also B1) will have the value given by point a. Ifyou have run the current to some very high value and come down to I, the ﬁeldwill be given by point b. Or, if you have just had a high negative current in themagnet and then come up to I, the ﬁeld is the one at point c. The ﬁeld in thegap will depend on what you have done in the past.When the current in the magnet is zero, the relation between B2 and H2in Eq. (36.27) is shown by the line marked I = 0 in the ﬁgure. There are stillvarious possible solutions. If you have ﬁrst saturated the iron, there may be aconsiderable residual ﬁeld in the magnet as given by point d. You can take the coiloﬀ, and you have a permanent magnet. You can see that for a good permanentmagnet, you would want a material with a wide hysteresis loop. Special alloys,such as Alnico V, have very wide loops.

36-6 Spontaneous magnetizationWe now turn to the question of why it is that in ferromagnetic materials asmall magnetic ﬁeld produces such a large magnetization. The magnetization offerromagnetic materials like iron and nickel comes from the magnetic momentof the electrons in the inner shell of the atom. Each electron has a magneticmoment µ equal to q/2m times its g-factor, times its angular momentum J. Fora single electron with no net orbital motion, g = 2, and the component of J inany direction—say the z-direction—is ±/2, so the component of µ along thez-axis is

= 0.928 × 10−23 amp·m2.

(36.28)In an iron atom, there are actually two electrons that contribute to the ferro-magnetism, so to keep the discussion simpler we will talk about nickel, which isferromagnetic like iron but which has only one electron in the inner shell. (It iseasy to extend the arguments to iron.)

µz = q2m

Now the point is that in the presence of an external ﬁeld B, the atomicmagnets tend to line up with the ﬁeld, but are knocked about by thermal motionsjust as we described for paramagnetic materials. In the last chapter we found outthat the balance between a magnetic ﬁeld trying to line up the atomic magnetsand the thermal motions trying to derange them produced the result that themean magnetic moment per unit volume will end up as

M = N µ tanh µBakT

.

(36.29)

By Ba we mean the ﬁeld acting at the atom, and kT is the Boltzmann energy.In the theory of paramagnetism we used for Ba just B itself, neglecting thepart of the ﬁeld at any given atom contributed by the atoms nearby. In theferromagnetic case, there is a complication. We shouldn’t use the average ﬁeld inthe iron for the Ba acting on an individual atom. Instead, we must do as we didin the case of dielectrics—we have to ﬁnd the local ﬁeld acting at a single atom.For an exact calculation we should add up the ﬁelds at the atom in questioncontributed by all of the other atoms in the crystal lattice. But as we did fordielectrics, we will make the approximation that the ﬁeld at an atom is the sameas we would ﬁnd in a small spherical hole in the material—assuming that themoments of the atoms in the neighborhood are not changed by the presence ofthe hole.

Following the arguments we made in Chapter 11, we might think that we

But that is not right. We can, however, make use of the results of Chapter 11 if wemake a careful comparison of the equations of Chapter 11 with the equations for36-11

ferromagnetism in this chapter. Let’s put together the corresponding equations.For regions where there are no conduction currents or charges we have:

These two sets of equations can be thought of as analogous if we make thefollowing purely mathematical correspondences:

E → B − M0c2 ,This is the same as making the analogy

E + P0

→ B.

In other words, if we write the equations of ferromagnetism as

E → H,

P → M /c2.

(cid:18)

∇ ·H + M0c2∇ × H = 0,

(36.31)

(36.32)

they look like the equations of electrostatics.This purely algebraic correspondence has led to some confusion in the past.People tended to think that H was「the magnetic ﬁeld.」But, as we have seen,B and E are physically the fundamental ﬁelds, and H is a derived idea. Soalthough the equations are analogous, the physics is not analogous. However,that doesn’t need to stop us from using the principle that the same equationshave the same solutions.

We can use our earlier results for the electric ﬁeld inside of holes of variousshapes in dielectrics—summarized in Fig. 36-1—to ﬁnd the ﬁeld H inside ofcorresponding holes. Knowing H, we can determine B. For instance (usingthe results we summarized in Section 36-1), the ﬁeld H in a needle-shaped holeparallel to M is the same as the H in the material,

But since M in the hole is zero, we have

Hhole = Hmaterial.

Bhole = Bmaterial − M0c2 .

(36.33)

On the other hand, for a disc-shaped hole, perpendicular to M, we have

which translates into

Or, in terms of B,

Ehole = Edielectric + P0

,

Hhole = Hmaterial + M0c2 .

(36.34)Finally, for a spherical hole, by making our analogy with Eq. (36.3) we wouldhave

Bhole = Bmaterial.

or

Hhole = Hmaterial + M30c2Bhole = Bmaterial − 23

M0c2 .This result is quite diﬀerent from what we got for E.

(36.35)

36-12

It is, of course, possible to get these results in a more physical way, by usingthe Maxwell equations directly. For example, Eq. (36.34) follows directly from∇ · B = 0. (You use a gaussian surface that is half in the material and half out.)Similarly, you can get Eq. (36.33) by using a line integral along a curve that goesup inside the hole and returns through the material. Physically, the ﬁeld in thehole is reduced because of the surface currents—which are given by ∇ × M. Wewill leave it for you to show that Eq. (36.35) can also be obtained by consideringthe eﬀects of the surface currents on the boundary of the spherical cavity.

In ﬁnding the equilibrium magnetization from Eq. (36.29), it turns out to be

most convenient to deal with H; so writeBa = H + λ

M0c2 .

(36.36)

In the spherical hole approximation, we would have λ = 13, but, as you will see, wewill want later to use some other value, so we leave it as an adjustable parameter.Also, we will take all the ﬁelds in the same direction so that we won’t need toworry about the vector directions. If we were now to substitute Eq. (36.36) intoEq. (36.29), we would have one equation that relates the magnetization M tothe magnetizing ﬁeld H:

(cid:18)

M = N µ tanh

It is however, an equation that cannot be solved explicitly, so we will do itgraphically.

(36.37)where Msat is the saturation value of the magnetization, namely, N µ, and xrepresents µBa/kT. The dependence of M/Msat on x is shown by curve a inFig. 36-13. We can also write x as a function of M—using Eq. (36.36) for Ba—as(36.38)

Msat

For any given value of H, this is a straight-line relationship between M/Msatand x. The x intercept is at x = µH/kT, and the slope is 0c2kT /µλMsat. Forany particular H, we would have a line like the one marked b in Fig. 36-13. Theintersection of curves a and b gives us the solution for M/Msat. We have solvedthe problem.Let’s look at how the solutions will go for various circumstances. We startwith H = 0. There are two possible situations, shown by the lines b1 and b2in Fig. 36-14. You will notice from Eq. (36.38) that the slope of the line isproportional to the absolute temperature T. So, at high temperatures we wouldhave a line like b1. The solution is M/Msat = 0. When the magnetizing ﬁeld His zero, the magnetization is also zero. But at low temperatures, we would havea line like b2, and there are two solutions for M/Msat—one with M/Msat = 0and one with M/Msat near one. It turns out that only the upper solution isstable—as you can see by considering small variations about these solutions.According to these ideas, then, a magnetic material should magnetize itselfIn short, when the thermalspontaneously at suﬃciently low temperatures.motions are small enough, the coupling between the atomic magnets causes themall to line up parallel to each other—we have a permanently magnetized materialanalogous to the ferroelectrics we discussed in Chapter 11.

If we start at high temperatures and come down, there is a critical temperature,called the Curie temperature Tc, where the ferromagnetic behavior suddenly setsin. This temperature corresponds to the line b3 of Fig. 36-14, which is tangent tothe curve a, and has, therefore, a slope of 1. The Curie temperature is given by

We can, if we wish, write Eq. (36.38) more simply in terms of Tc as

x = µHkT

+ TcT

(36.40)

Now we want to see what happens for small magnetizing ﬁelds H. We cansee from Fig. 36-14 how things will go if we shift our straight lines a little to theright. For the low-temperature case, the intersection point will move out a littlebit along the low-slope part of curve a, and M will change relatively little. Forthe high-temperature case, however, the intersection point runs up the steep partof curve a, and M will change relatively rapidly. In fact, we can approximatethis part of curve a by a straight line of unit slope, and write:

(36.41)

We have a law that is something like the one we had for paramagnetism. Forparamagnetism, we had

.

MMsat

= µBkT

(36.42)One diﬀerence now is that we have the magnetization in terms of H, whichincludes some of the eﬀects of the interaction of the atomic magnets, but themain diﬀerence is that the magnetization is inversely proportional to the diﬀerencebetween T and Tc, instead of to the absolute temperate T, alone. Neglectingthe interactions between neighboring atoms corresponds to taking λ = 0, whichfrom Eq. (36.39) means taking Tc = 0. Then the results are just what we had inChapter 35.We can check our theoretical picture with the experimental data for nickel. Itis observed experimentally that the ferromagnetic behavior of nickel disappearswhen its temperature is raised above 631◦K. We can compare this with Tccalculated from Eq. (36.39). Remembering that Msat = µN, we have

Tc = λ

N µ2k0c2 .

From the density and atomic weight of nickel, we get

N = 9.1 × 1028 m−3.

Taking µ from Eq. (36.28), and setting λ = 1Tc = 0.24◦K.

3, we get

There is a discrepancy of a factor of about 2600! Our theory of ferromagnetismfails completely.We can try to「patch up」the theory as Weiss did by saying that for someunknown reason λ is not one-third, but (2600) × 13—or about 900. It turns outthat one gets similar values for other ferromagnetic materials like iron. To seewhat this means, let’s go back to Eq. (36.36). We see that a large λ means thatBa, the local ﬁeld on the atom, appears to be much, much larger than we wouldthink. In fact, writing H = B − M/0c2, we haveBa = B + (λ − 1)M0c23 the local magnetization M reduces3 M/0c2. Even if our model of a spherical36-14

According to our original idea—with λ = 1the eﬀective ﬁeld Ba by the amount − 2

.

hole were not very good, we would still expect some reduction. Instead, to explainthe phenomenon of ferromagnetism, we have to imagine that the magnetizationof the ﬁeld enhances the local ﬁeld by some large factor—like one thousandor more. There doesn’t seem to be any reasonable way to manufacture suchtremendous ﬁelds at an atom—nor even ﬁelds of the proper sign! Clearly, our「magnetic」theory of ferromagnetism is a dismal failure. We must conclude, then,that ferromagnetism has to do with some nonmagnetic interaction between thespinning electrons in neighboring atoms. This interaction must generate a strongtendency for all of the nearby spins to line up in one direction. We will see laterthat it has to do with quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle.

Finally, we look at what happens at low temperatures—for T < Tc. We haveseen that there will then be a spontaneous magnetization—even with H = 0—given by the intersection of the curves a and b2 of Fig. 36-14. If we solve for M forvarious temperatures—by varying the slope of the line b2—we get the theoreticalcurve shown in Fig. 36-15. This curve should be the same for all ferromagneticmaterials for which the atomic moment comes from a single electron. The curvesfor other materials are only slightly diﬀerent.

In the limit, as T goes to absolute zero, M goes to Msat. As the temperatureis increased, the magnetization decreases, falling to zero at the Curie temperature.The points in Fig. 36-15 are the experimental observations for nickel. They ﬁtthe theoretical curve fairly well. Even though we don’t understand the basicmechanism, the general features of the theory seem to be correct.

Finally, there is one more disturbing discrepancy in our attempt to understandferromagnetism. We have found that above some temperature the material shouldbehave like a paramagnetic substance with a magnetization M proportionalto H (or B), and that below that temperature it should become spontaneouslymagnetized. But that’s not what we found when we measured the magnetizationcurve for iron. It only became permanently magnetized after we had「magnetized」it. According to the ideas just discussed, it would magnetize itself! What iswrong? Well, it turns out that if you look at a small enough crystal of iron ornickel, it is indeed completely magnetized! But in large pieces of iron, there aremany small regions or「domains」that are magnetized in diﬀerent directions, sothat on a large scale the average magnetization appears to be zero. In each smalldomain, however, the iron has a locked-in magnetization with M nearly equalto Msat. The consequences of this domain structure are that gross properties oflarge pieces of material are quite diﬀerent from the microscopic properties thatwe have really been treating. We will take up in the next lecture the story of thepractical behavior of bulk magnetic materials.

Magnetic Materials

37-1 Understanding ferromagnetismIn

this chapter we will discuss the behavior and peculiarities of ferromagneticmaterials and of other strange magnetic materials. Before proceeding to studymagnetic materials, however, we will review very quickly some of the things aboutthe general theory of magnets that we learned in the last chapter.

First, we imagine the atomic currents inside the material that are responsiblefor the magnetism, and then describe them in terms of a volume current den-sity jmag = ∇ × M. We emphasize that this is not supposed to represent theactual currents. When the magnetization is uniform the currents do not reallycancel out precisely; that is, the whirling currents of one electron in one atomand the whirling currents of an electron in another atom do not overlap in sucha way that the sum is exactly zero. Even within a single atom the distributionof magnetism is not smooth. For instance, in an iron atom the magnetizationis distributed in a more or less spherical shell, not too close to the nucleus andnot too far away. Thus, magnetism in matter is quite a complicated thing in itsdetails; it is very irregular. However, we are obliged now to ignore this detailedcomplexity and discuss phenomena from a gross, average point of view. Thenit is true that the average current in the interior region, over any ﬁnite areathat is big compared with an atom, is zero when M = 0. So, what we meanby magnetization per unit volume and jmag and so on, at the level we are nowconsidering, is an average over regions that are large compared with the spaceoccupied by a single atom.

In the last chapter, we also discovered that a ferromagnetic material has thefollowing interesting property: above a certain temperature it is not stronglymagnetic, whereas below this temperature it becomes magnetic. This fact iseasily demonstrated. A piece of nickel wire at room temperature is attractedby a magnet. However, if we heat it above its Curie temperature with a gasﬂame, it becomes nonmagnetic and is not attracted toward the magnet—evenwhen brought quite close to the magnet. If we let it lie near the magnet while itcools oﬀ, at the instant its temperature falls below the critical temperature it issuddenly attracted again by the magnet!

The general theory of ferromagnetism that we will use supposes that thespin of the electron is responsible for the magnetization. The electron has spinone-half and carries one Bohr magneton of magnetic moment µ = µB = qe/2m.The electron spin can be pointed either「up」or「down.」Because the electronhas a negative charge, when its spin is「up」it has a negative moment, and whenits spin is「down」it has a positive moment. With our usual conventions, themoment µ of the electron is opposite its spin. We have found that the energy oforientation of a magnetic dipole in a given applied ﬁeld B is −µ · B, but theenergy of the spinning electrons depends on the neighboring spin alignments aswell. In iron, if the moment of a nearby atom is「up,」there is a very strongtendency that the moment of the one next to it will also be「up.」That is whatmakes iron, cobalt, and nickel so strongly magnetic—the moments all want to beparallel. The ﬁrst question we have to discuss is why.Soon after the development of quantum mechanics, it was noticed that thereis a very strong apparent force—not a magnetic force or any other kind of actualforce, but only an apparent force—trying to line the spins of nearby electronsopposite to one another. These forces are closely related to chemical valence forces.There is a principle in quantum mechanics—called the exclusion principle—that37-1

two electrons cannot occupy exactly the same state, that they cannot be inexactly the same condition as to location and spin orientation.* For example, ifthey are at the same point, the only alternative is to have their spins opposite.So, if there is a region of space between atoms where electrons like to congregate(as in a chemical bond) and we want to put another electron on top of onealready there, the only way to do it is to have the spin of the second one pointedopposite to the spin of the ﬁrst one. To have the spins parallel is against the law,unless the electrons stay away from each other. This has the eﬀect that a pairof parallel-spin electrons near to each other have much more energy than a pairof opposite-spin electrons; the net eﬀect is as though there were a force tryingto turn the spin over. Sometimes this spin-turning force is called the exchangeforce, but that only makes it more mysterious—it is not a very good term. It isjust because of the exclusion principle that electrons have a tendency to maketheir spins opposite. In fact, that is the explanation of the lack of magnetism inalmost all substances! The spins of the free electrons on the outside of the atomshave tremendous tendency to balance in opposite directions. The problem is toexplain why for materials like iron it is just the reverse of what we should expect.We have summarized the supposed alignment eﬀect by adding a suitable termin the energy equation, by saying that if the electron magnets in the neighborhoodhave a mean magnetization M, then the moment of an electron has a strongtendency to be in the same direction as the average magnetization of the atomsin the neighborhood. Thus, we may write for the two possible spin orientations,†

When it was clear that quantum mechanics could supply a tremendousspin-orientating force—even if, apparently, of the wrong sign—it was suggestedthat ferromagnetism might have its origin in this same force, that due to thecomplexities of iron and the large number of electrons involved, the sign of theinteraction energy would come out the other way around. Since the time this wasthought of—in about 1927 when quantum mechanics was ﬁrst being understood—many people have been making various estimates and semicalculations, tryingto get a theoretical prediction for λ. The most recent calculations of the energybetween the two electron spins in iron—assuming that the interaction is a directone between the two electrons in neighboring atoms—still give the wrong sign.The present understanding of this is again to assume that the complexity of thesituation is somehow responsible and to hope that the next man who makes thecalculation with a more complicated situation will get the right answer!

It is believed that the up-spin of one of the electrons in the inside shell, whichis making the magnetism, tends to make the conduction electrons which ﬂyaround the outside have the opposite spin. One might expect this to happenbecause the conduction electrons come into the same region as the「magnetic」electrons. Since they move around, they can carry their prejudice for being upsidedown over to the next atom; that is, one「magnetic」electron tries to force theconduction electrons to be opposite, and the conduction electron then makesthe next「magnetic」electron opposite to it. The double interaction is equivalentto an interaction which tries to line up the two「magnetic」electrons. In otherwords, the tendency to make parallel spins is the result of an intermediary thattends to some extent to be opposite to both. This mechanism does not requirethat the conduction electrons be completely「upside down.」They could just havea slight prejudice to be down, just enough to load the「magnetic」odds the otherway. This is the mechanism that the people who have calculated such things now

* See Chapter 4 of Vol. III (section 4-7).† We write these equations with H = B − M/0c2 instead of B to agree with the work ofthe last chapter. You might prefer to write U = ±µBa = ±µ(B + λ0M/0c2), where λ0 = λ − 1.It’s the same thing.

believe is responsible for ferromagnetism. But we must emphasize that to this daynobody can calculate the magnitude of λ simply by knowing that the material isnumber 26 in the periodic table. In short, we don’t thoroughly understand it.Now let us continue with the theory, and then come back later to discuss acertain error involved in the way we have set it up. If the magnetic moment of acertain electron is「up,」energy comes both from the external ﬁeld and also fromthe tendency of the spins to be parallel. Since the energy is lower when the spinsare parallel, the eﬀect is sometimes thought of as due to an「eﬀective internalﬁeld.」But remember, it is not due to a true magnetic force; it is an interactionthat is more complicated. In any case, we take Eqs. (37.1) as the formulas forthe energies of the two spin states of a「magnetic」electron. At a temperature T,the relative probability of these two states is proportional to e−energy/kT , whichwe can write as e±x, with x = µ(H + λM/0c2)/kT. Then, if we calculate themean value of the magnetic moment, we ﬁnd (as in the last chapter) that it is(37.2)Now we would like to calculate the internal energy of the material. We notethat the energy of an electron is exactly proportional to the magnetic moment, sothat the calculation of the mean moment and the calculation of the mean energyare the same—except that in place of µ in Eq. (37.2) we would write −µB, whichis −µ(H + λM/0c2). The mean energy is then

M = N µ tanh x.

hUiav = −N µ

H + λM0c2

tanh x.

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

Now this is not quite correct. The term λM/0c2 represents interactions ofall possible pairs of atoms, and we must remember to count each pair only once.(When we consider the energy of one electron in the ﬁeld of the rest and thenthe energy of a second electron in the ﬁeld of the rest, we have counted part ofthe ﬁrst energy once more.) Thus, we must divide the mutual interaction termby two, and our formula for the energy then turns out to be

hUiav = −N µ

H + λM20c2

tanh x.

(37.3)

In the last chapter we discovered an interesting thing—that below a certaintemperature the material ﬁnds a solution to the equations in which the magneticmoment is not zero, even with no external magnetizing ﬁeld. When we set H = 0in Eq. (37.2), we found that

(37.4)

where Msat = N µ, and Tc = µλMsat/k0c2. When we solve this equation(graphically or otherwise), we ﬁnd that the ratio M/Msat as a function of T /Tc isa curve like that labeled「quantum theory」in Fig. 37-1. The dashed curve marked「cobalt, nickel」shows the experimental results for crystals of these elements. Thetheory and experiment are in reasonably good agreement. The ﬁgure also showsthe result of the classical theory in which the calculation is carried out assumingthat the atomic magnets can have all possible orientations in space. You can seethat this assumption gives a prediction that is not even close to the experimentalfacts.

Even the quantum theory deviates from the observed behavior at both highand low temperatures. The reason for the deviations is that we have made arather sloppy approximation in the theory: We have assumed that the energyof an atom depends upon the mean magnetization of its neighboring atoms. Inother words, for each one that is「up」in the neighborhood of a given atom, therewill be a contribution of energy due to that quantum mechanical alignment eﬀect.But how many are there pointed「up」? On the average, that is measured bythe magnetization M—but only on the average. A particular atom somewhere37-3

might ﬁnd all its neighbors「up.」Then its energy will be larger than the average.Another one might ﬁnd some up and some down, perhaps averaging to zero, andit would have no energy from that term, and so on. What we ought to do is touse some more complicated kind of average, because the atoms in diﬀerent placeshave diﬀerent environments, and the numbers up and down are diﬀerent fordiﬀerent ones. Instead of just taking one atom subjected to the average inﬂuence,we should take each one in its actual situation, compute its energy, and ﬁndthe average energy. But how do we ﬁnd out how many are「up」and how manyare「down」in the neighborhood? That is, of course, just what we are tryingto calculate—the number「up」and「down」—so we have a very complicatedinterconnected problem of correlations, a problem which has never been solved.It is an intriguing and exciting one which has existed for years and on whichsome of the greatest names in physics have written papers, but even they havenot completely solved it.

It turns out that at low temperatures, when almost all the atomic magnets are「up」and only a few are「down,」it is easy to solve; and at high temperatures, farabove the Curie temperature Tc when they are almost all random, it is again easy.It is often easy to calculate small departures from some simple, idealized situation,so it is fairly well understood why there are deviations from the simple theory atlow temperature. It is also understood physically that for statistical reasons themagnetization should deviate at high temperatures. But the exact behavior nearthe Curie point has never been thoroughly ﬁgured out. That’s an interestingproblem to work out some day if you want a problem that has never been solved.

37-2 Thermodynamic propertiesIn the last chapter we laid the groundwork necessary for calculating thethermodynamic properties of ferromagnetic materials. These are, naturally,related to the internal energy of the crystal, which includes interactions ofthe various spins, given by Eq. (37.3). For the energy of the spontaneousmagnetization below the Curie point, we can set H = 0 in Eq. (37.3), and—noticing that tanh x = M/Msat—we ﬁnd a mean energy proportional to M 2:

hUiav = − N µλM 220c2Msat

.

(37.5)

If we now plot the energy due to the magnetism as a function of temperature, weget a curve which is the negative of the square of the curve of Fig. 37-1, as drawnin Fig. 37-2(a). If we were to measure then the speciﬁc heat of such a material wewould obtain a curve which is the derivative of 37-2(a). It is shown in Fig. 37-2(b).37-4

Fig. 37-2. The energy per unit volumeand speciﬁc heat of a ferromagnetic crystal.

It rises slowly with increasing temperature, but falls suddenly to zero at T = Tc.The sharp drop is due to the change in slope of the magnetic energy and isreached right at the Curie point. So without any magnetic measurements at allwe could have discovered that something was going on inside of iron or nickelby measuring this thermodynamic property. However, both experiment andimproved theory (with ﬂuctuations included) suggest that this simple curve iswrong and that the true situation is really more complicated. The curve goeshigher at the peak and falls to zero somewhat slowly. Even if the temperature ishigh enough to randomize the spins on the average, there are still local regionswhere there is a certain amount of polarization, and in these regions the spinsstill have a little extra energy of interaction—which only dies out slowly as thingsget more and more random with further increases in temperature. So the actualcurve looks like Fig. 37-2(c). One of the challenges of theoretical physics todayis to ﬁnd an exact theoretical description of the character of the speciﬁc heatnear the Curie transition—an intriguing problem which has not yet been solved.Naturally, this problem is very closely related to the shape of the magnetizationcurve in the same region.

Now we want to describe some experiments, other than thermodynamic ones,which show that there is something right about our interpretation of magnetism.When the material is magnetized to saturation at low enough temperatures, Mis very nearly equal to Msat—nearly all the spins are parallel, as well as theirmagnetic moments. We can check this by an experiment. Suppose we suspend abar magnet by a thin ﬁber and then surround it by a coil so that we can reversethe magnetic ﬁeld without touching the magnet or putting any torque on it.This is a very diﬃcult experiment because the magnetic forces are so enormousthat any irregularities, any lopsidedness, or any lack of perfection in the ironwill produce accidental torques. However, the experiment has been done undercareful conditions in which such accidental torques are minimized. By meansof the magnetic ﬁeld from a coil that surrounds the bar, we turn all the atomicmagnets over at once. When we do this we also change the angular momenta ofall the spins from「up」to「down」(see Fig. 37-3). If angular momentum is to beconserved when the spins all turn over, the rest of the bar must have an oppositechange in angular momentum. The whole magnet will start to spin. And sureenough, when we do the experiment, we ﬁnd a slight turning of the magnet.We can measure the total angular momentum given to the whole magnet, andthis is simply N times , the change in the angular momentum of each spin.The ratio of angular momentum to magnetic moment measured this way comesout to within about 10 percent of what we calculate. Actually, our calculationsassume that the atomic magnets are due purely to the electron spin, but thereis, in addition, some orbital motion also in most materials. The orbital motionis not completely free of the lattice and does not contribute much more thana few percent to the magnetism. As a matter of fact, the saturation magneticﬁeld that one gets taking Msat = N µ and using the density of iron of 7.9 andthe moment µ of the spinning electron is about 20,000 gauss. But according toexperiment, it is actually in the neighborhood of 21,500 gauss. This is a typicalmagnitude of error—5 or 10 percent—due to neglecting the contributions of theorbital moments that have not been included in making the analysis. Thus, aslight discrepancy with the gyromagnetic measurements is quite understandable.

37-3 The hysteresis curveWe have concluded from our theoretical analysis that a ferromagnetic materialshould spontaneously become magnetized below a certain temperature so that allthe magnetism would be in the same direction. But we know that this is not truefor an ordinary piece of unmagnetized iron. Why isn’t all iron magnetized? Wecan explain it with the help of Fig. 37-4. Suppose the iron were all a big singlecrystal of the shape shown in Fig. 37-4(a) and spontaneously magnetized all inone direction. Then there would be a considerable external magnetic ﬁeld, whichwould have a lot of energy. We can reduce that ﬁeld energy if we arrange that37-5

Fig. 37-3. When the magnetization of abar of iron is reversed, the bar is given someangular momentum.

Fig. 37-4. The formation of domains in asingle crystal of iron. [From Charles Kittel,Introduction to Solid State Physics, JohnWiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 2nd ed.,1956.]

one side of the block is magnetized「up」and the other side magnetized「down,」as in Fig. 37-4(b). Then, of course, the ﬁelds outside the iron would extend overless volume, so there would be less energy there.

Ah, but wait! In the layer between the two regions we have up-spinningelectrons adjacent to down-spinning electrons. But ferromagnetism appears onlyin those materials for which the energy is reduced if the electrons are parallelrather than opposite. So, we have added some extra energy along the dottedline in Fig. 37-4(b); this energy is sometimes called wall energy. A region havingonly one direction of magnetization is called a domain. At the interface—the「wall」—between two domains, where we have atoms on opposite sides which arespinning in diﬀerent directions, there is an energy per unit area of the wall. Wehave described it as though two adjacent atoms were spinning exactly opposite,but it turns out that nature adjusts things so that the transition is more gradual.But we don’t need to worry about such ﬁne details at this point.

Now the question is: When is it better or worse to make a wall? The answeris that it depends on the size of the domains. Suppose that we were to scale up ablock so that the whole thing was twice as big. The volume in the space outsideﬁlled with a given magnetic ﬁeld strength would be eight times bigger, and theenergy in the magnetic ﬁeld, which is proportional to the volume, would also beeight times greater. But the surface area between two domains, which will givethe wall energy, would be only four times as big. Therefore, if the piece of ironis big enough, it will pay to split it into more domains. This is why only the verytiny crystals can have but a single domain. Any large object—one more thanabout a hundredth of a millimeter in size—will have at least one domain wall;and any ordinary,「centimeter-size」object will be split into many domains, asshown in the ﬁgure. Splitting into domains goes on until the energy needed to putin one extra wall is as large as the energy decrease in the magnetic ﬁeld outsidethe crystal.Actually nature has discovered still another way to lower the energy: It isnot necessary to have the ﬁeld go outside at all, if a little triangular regionis magnetized sideways, as in Fig. 37-4(d).* Then with the arrangement ofFig. 37-4(d) we see that there is no external ﬁeld, but instead only a little moredomain wall.But that introduces a new kind of problem. It turns out that when a singlecrystal of iron is magnetized, it changes its length in the direction of magnetization,so an「ideal」cube with its magnetization, say,「up,」is no longer a perfect cube.The「vertical」dimension will be diﬀerent from the「horizontal」dimension. Thiseﬀect is called magnetostriction. Because of such geometric changes, the littletriangular pieces of Fig. 37-4(d) do not, so to speak,「ﬁt」into the available spaceanymore—the crystal has got too long one way and too short the other way. Ofcourse, it does ﬁt, really, but only by being squashed in; and this involves somemechanical stresses. So, this arrangement also introduces an extra energy. It isthe balance of all these various energies which determines how the domains ﬁnallyarrange themselves in their complicated fashion in a piece of unmagnetized iron.Now, what happens when we put on an external magnetic ﬁeld? To take asimple case, consider a crystal whose domains are as shown in Fig. 37-4(d). If weapply an external magnetic ﬁeld in the upward direction, in what manner doesthe crystal become magnetized? First, the middle domain wall can move oversideways (to the right) and reduce the energy. It moves over so that the regionwhich is「up」becomes bigger than the region which is「down.」There are moreelementary magnets lined up with the ﬁeld, and this gives a lower energy. So, for apiece of iron in weak ﬁelds—at the very beginning of magnetization—the domainwalls begin to move and eat into the regions which are magnetized opposite tothe ﬁeld. As the ﬁeld continues to increase, a whole crystal shifts gradually into

* You may be wondering how spins that have to be either「up」or「down」can also be「sideways」! That’s a good question, but we won’t worry about it right now. We’ll simply adoptthe classical point of view, thinking of the atomic magnets as classical dipoles which can bepolarized sideways. Quantum mechanics requires considerable expertness to understand howthings can be quantized both「up-and-down,」and「right-and-left,」all at the same time.

37-6

a single large domain which the external ﬁeld helps to keep lined up. In a strongﬁeld the crystal「likes」to be all one way just because its energy in the applied ﬁeldis reduced—it is no longer merely the crystal’s own external ﬁeld which matters.What if the geometry is not so simple? What if the axes of the crystal andits spontaneous magnetization are in one direction, but we apply the magneticﬁeld in some other direction—say at 45◦? We might think that domains wouldreform themselves with their magnetization parallel to the ﬁeld, and then asbefore, they could all grow into one domain. But this is not easy for the ironto do, for the energy needed to magnetize a crystal depends on the direction ofmagnetization relative to the crystal axis. It is relatively easy to magnetize ironin a direction parallel to the crystal axes, but it takes more energy to magnetizeit in some other direction—like 45◦ with respect to one of the axes. Therefore,if we apply a magnetic ﬁeld in such a direction, what happens ﬁrst is that thedomains which point along one of the preferred directions which is near to theapplied ﬁeld grow until the magnetization is all along one of these directions.Then with much stronger ﬁelds, the magnetization is gradually pulled aroundparallel to the ﬁeld, as sketched in Fig. 37-5.

In Fig. 37-6 are shown some observations of the magnetization curves of singlecrystals of iron. To understand them, we must ﬁrst explain something aboutthe notation that is used in describing directions in a crystal. There are manyways in which a crystal can be sliced so as to produce a face which is a planeof atoms. Everyone who has driven past an orchard or vineyard knows this—itis fascinating to watch. If you look one way, you see lines of trees—if you lookanother way, you see diﬀerent lines of trees, and so on. In a similar way, a crystalhas deﬁnite families of planes that hold many atoms, and the planes have thisimportant characteristic (we consider a cubic crystal to make it easier): If weobserve where the planes intersect the three coordinate axes—we ﬁnd that thereciprocals of the three distances from the origin are in the ratio of simple wholenumbers. These three whole numbers are taken as the deﬁnition of the planes.For example, in Fig. 37-7(a), a plane parallel to the yz-plane is shown. Thisis called a [100] plane; the reciprocals of its intersection of the y- and z-axesare both zero. The direction perpendicular to such a plane (in a cubic crystal)is given the same set of numbers. It is easy to understand the idea in a cubiccrystal, for then the indices [100] mean a vector which has a unit component inthe x-direction and none in the y- or z-directions. The [110] direction is in adirection 45◦ from the x- and y-axes, as in Fig. 37-7(b); and the [111] directionis in the direction of the cube diagonal, as in Fig. 37-7(c).

Fig. 37-5. A magnetizing ﬁeld H at anangle with respect to the crystal axis willgradually change the direction of the mag-netization without changing its magnitude.

Returning now to Fig. 37-6, we see the magnetization curves of a single crystalof iron for various directions. First, note that for very tiny ﬁelds—so weak thatit is hard to see them on the scale at all—the magnetization increases extremelyrapidly to quite large values. If the ﬁeld is in the [100] direction—namely alongone of those nice, easy directions of magnetization—the curve goes up to a highvalue, curves around a little, and then is saturated. What happened is that the37-7

domains which were already there are very easily removed. Only a small ﬁeldis required to make the domain walls move and eat up all of the「wrong-way」domains. Single crystals of iron are enormously permeable (magnetic sense),much more so than ordinary polycrystalline iron. A perfect crystal magnetizesextremely easily. Why is it curved at all? Why doesn’t it just go right up tosaturation? We are not sure. You might study that some day. We do understandwhy it is ﬂat for high ﬁelds. When the whole block is a single domain, the extramagnetic ﬁeld cannot make any more magnetization—it is already at Msat, withall the electrons lines up.Now, if we try to do the same thing in the [110] direction—which is at 45◦to the crystal axes—what will happen? We turn on a little bit of ﬁeld and themagnetization leaps up as the domains grow. Then as we increase the ﬁeld somemore, we ﬁnd that it takes quite a lot of ﬁeld to get up to saturation, because nowthe magnetization is turning away from an「easy」direction. If this explanationis correct, the point at which the [110] curve extrapolates back to the vertical√2 of the saturation value.axis should be at 1/It turns out, in fact, to be√2. Similarly, in the [111] direction—which is along thevery, very close to 1/cube diagonal—we ﬁnd, as we would expect, that the curve extrapolates back tonearly 1/

√3 of saturation.

Figure 37-8 shows the corresponding situation for two other materials, nickeland cobalt. Nickel is diﬀerent from iron. In nickel, it turns out that the [111] di-rection is the easy direction of magnetization. Cobalt has a hexagonal crystalform, and people have botched up the system of nomenclature for this case. Theywant to have three axes on the bottom of the hexagon and one perpendicularto these, so they have used four indices. The [0001] direction is the direction ofthe axis of the hexagon, and [1010] is perpendicular to that axis. We see thatcrystals of diﬀerent metals behave in diﬀerent ways.

Now we must discuss a polycrystalline material, such as an ordinary pieceof iron. Inside such materials there are many, many little crystals with theircrystalline axes pointing every which way. These are not the same as domains.Remember that the domains were all part of a single crystal, but in a piece of iron

37-8

there are many diﬀerent crystals with axes at diﬀerent orientations, as shown inFig. 37-9. Within each of these crystals, there will also generally be some domains.When we apply a small magnetic ﬁeld to a piece of polycrystalline material, whathappens is that the domain walls begin to move, and the domains which have afavorable direction of easy magnetization grow larger. This growth is reversible solong as the ﬁeld stays very small—if we turn the ﬁeld oﬀ, the magnetization willreturn to zero. This part of the magnetization curve is marked a in Fig. 37-10.For larger ﬁelds—in the region b of the magnetization curve shown—thingsget much more complicated. In every small crystal of the material, there arestrains and dislocations; there are impurities, dirt, and imperfections. And at allbut the smallest ﬁelds, the domain wall, in moving, gets stuck on these. Thereis an interaction energy between the domain wall and a dislocation, or a grainboundary, or an impurity. So when the wall gets to one of them, it gets stuck;it sticks there at a certain ﬁeld. But then if the ﬁeld is raised some more, thewall suddenly snaps past. So the motion of the domain wall is not smooth theway it is in a perfect crystal—it gets hung up every once in a while and moves injerks. If we were to look at the magnetization on a microscopic scale, we wouldsee something like the insert of Fig. 37-10.

Now the important thing is that these jerks in the magnetization can cause anenergy loss. In the ﬁrst place, when a boundary ﬁnally slips past an impediment,it moves very quickly to the next one, since the ﬁeld is already above what wouldbe required for the unimpeded motion. The rapid motion means that there arerapidly changing magnetic ﬁelds which produce eddy currents in the crystal.These currents lose energy in heating the metal. A second eﬀect is that when adomain suddenly changes, part of the crystal changes its dimensions from themagnetostriction. Each sudden shift of a domain wall sets up a little sound wavethat carries away energy. Because of such eﬀects, the second part of magnetizationcurve is irreversible, and there is energy being lost. This is the origin of thehysteresis eﬀect, because to move a boundary wall forward—snap—and then tomove it backward—snap—produces a diﬀerent result. It’s like「jerky」friction,and it takes energy.

Eventually, for high enough ﬁelds, when we have moved all the domain wallsand magnetized each crystal in its best direction, there are still some crystalliteswhich happen to have their easy directions of magnetization not in the directionof our external magnetic ﬁeld. Then it takes a lot of extra ﬁeld to turn thosemagnetic moments around. So the magnetization increases slowly, but smoothly,for high ﬁelds—namely in the region marked c in the ﬁgure. The magnetizationdoes not come sharply to its saturation value, because in the last part of thecurve the atomic magnets are turning in the strong ﬁeld. So we see why themagnetization curve of an ordinary polycrystalline materials, such as the oneshown in Fig. 37-10, rises a little bit and reversibly at ﬁrst, then rises irreversibly,and then curves over slowly. Of course, there is no sharp break-point betweenthe three regions—they blend smoothly, one into the other.

It is not hard to show that the magnetization process in the middle part of themagnetization curve is jerky—that the domain walls jerk and snap as they shift.All you need is a coil of wire—with many thousands of turns—connected to anampliﬁer and a loudspeaker, as shown in Fig. 37-11. If you put a few silicon steelsheets (of the type used in transformers) at the center of the coil and bring a barmagnet slowly near the stack, the sudden changes in magnetization will produceimpulses of emf in the coil, which are heard as distinct clicks in the loudspeaker.As you move the magnet nearer to the iron you will hear a whole rush of clicksthat sound something like the noise of sand grains falling over each other as acan of sand is tilted. The domain walls are jumping, snapping, and jiggling asthe ﬁeld is increased. This phenomenon is called the Barkhausen eﬀect.As you move the magnet even closer to the iron sheets, the noise grows louderand louder for a while but then there is relatively little noise when the magnetgets very close. Why? Because nearly all the domain walls have moved as faras they can go. Any greater ﬁeld is merely turning the magnetization in eachdomain, which is a smooth process.

If you now withdraw the magnet, so as to come back on the downward branchof the hysteresis loop, the domains all try to get back to low energy again, andyou hear another rush of backward-going jerks. You can also note that if youbring the magnet to a given place and move it back and forth a little bit, there isrelatively little noise. It is again like tilting a can of sand—once the grains shiftinto place, small movements of the can don’t disturb them. In the iron the smallvariations in the magnetic ﬁeld aren’t enough to move any boundaries over anyof the「humps.」

37-4 Ferromagnetic materialsNow we would like to talk about the various kinds of magnetic materials thatthere are in the technical world and to consider some of the problems involved indesigning magnetic materials for diﬀerent purposes. First, the term「the magneticproperties of iron,」which one often hears, is a misnomer—there is no such thing.「Iron」is not a well-deﬁned material—the properties of iron depend critically onthe amount of impurities and also on how the iron is formed. You can appreciatethat the magnetic properties will depend on how easily the domain walls move andthat this is a gross property, not a property of the individual atoms. So practicalferromagnetism is not really a property of an iron atom—it is a property of solidiron in a certain form. For example, iron can take on two diﬀerent crystallineforms. The common form has a body-centered cubic lattice, but it can alsohave a face-centered cubic lattice, which is, however, stable only at temperaturesabove 1100◦C. Of course, at that temperature the body-centered cubic structureis already past the Curie point. However, by alloying chromium and nickel withthe iron (one possible mixture is 18 percent chromium and 8 percent nickel) wecan get what is called stainless steel, which, although it is mainly iron, retains theface-centered lattice even at low temperatures. Because its crystal structure isdiﬀerent, it has completely diﬀerent magnetic properties. Most kinds of stainlesssteel are not magnetic to any appreciable degree, although there are some kindswhich are somewhat magnetic—it depends on the composition of the alloy. Evenwhen such an alloy is magnetic, it is not ferromagnetic like ordinary iron—eventhough it is mostly just iron.We would like now to describe a few of the special materials which havebeen developed for their particular magnetic properties. First, if we want tomake a permanent magnet, we would like material with an enormously widehysteresis loop so that, when we turn the current oﬀ and come down to zeromagnetizing ﬁeld, the magnetization will remain large. For such materials thedomain boundaries should be「frozen」in place as much as possible. One suchmaterial is the remarkable alloy「Alnico V」(51% Fe, 8% Al, 14% Ni, 24% Co,3% Cu). (The rather complex composition of this alloy is indicative of the kind ofdetailed eﬀort that has gone into making good magnets. What patience it takesto mix ﬁve things together and test them until you ﬁnd the most ideal substance!)When Alnico solidiﬁes, there is a「second phase」which precipitates out, makingmany tiny grains and very high internal strains. In this material, the domainboundaries have a hard time moving at all. In addition to having a precisecomposition, Alnico is mechanically「worked」in a way that makes the crystalsappear in the form of long grains along the direction in which the magnetization isgoing to be. Then the magnetization will have a natural tendency to be lined up inthese directions and will be held there from the anisotropic eﬀects. Furthermore,the material is even cooled in an external magnetic ﬁeld when it is manufactured,so that the grains will grow with the right crystal orientation. The hysteresis loopof Alnico V is shown in Fig. 37-12. You see that it is about 700 times wider thanthe hysteresis curve for soft iron that we showed in the last chapter in Fig. 36-8.Let’s turn now to a diﬀerent kind of material. For building transformersand motors, we want a material which is magnetically「soft」—one in which themagnetism is easily changed so that an enormous amount of magnetization resultsfrom a very small applied ﬁeld. To arrange this, we need pure, well-annealedmaterial which will have very few dislocations and impurities so that the domain37-10

walls can move easily. It would also be nice if we could make the anisotropysmall. Then, even if a grain of the material sits at the wrong angle with respectto the ﬁeld, it will still magnetize easily. Now we have said that iron prefers tomagnetize along the [100] direction, whereas nickel prefers the [111] direction;so if we mix iron and nickel in various proportions, we might hope to ﬁnd thatwith just the right proportions the alloy wouldn’t prefer any direction—the [100]and [111] directions would be equivalent. It turns out that this happens witha mixture of 70 percent nickel and 30 percent iron. In addition—possibly byluck or maybe because of some physical relationship between the anisotropy andthe magnetostriction eﬀects—it turns out that the magnetostriction of iron andnickel has the opposite sign. And in an alloy of the two metals, this propertygoes through zero at about 80 percent nickel. So somewhere between 70 and80 percent nickel we get very「soft」magnetic materials—alloys that are very easyto magnetize. They are called the permalloys. Permalloys are useful for high-quality transformers (at low signal levels), but they would be no good at all forpermanent magnets. Permalloys must be very carefully made and handled. Themagnetic properties of a piece of permalloy are drastically changed if it is stressedbeyond its elastic limit—it mustn’t be bent. Then, its permeability is reducedbecause of the dislocations, slip bands, and so on, which are produced by themechanical deformations. The domain boundaries are no longer easy to move. Thehigh permeability can, however, be restored by annealing at high temperatures.It is often convenient to have some numbers to characterize the variousmagnetic materials. Two useful numbers are the intercepts of the hysteresis loopwith the B- and H-axes, as indicated in Fig. 37-12. These intercepts are calledthe remanent magnetic ﬁeld Br and the coercive force Hc. In Table 37-1 we listthese numbers for a few magnetic materials.

37-5 Extraordinary magnetic materialsWe would now like to discuss some of the more exotic magnetic materials.There are many elements in the periodic table which have incomplete innerelectron shells and hence have atomic magnetic moments. For instance, right nextto the ferromagnetic elements iron, nickel, and cobalt you will ﬁnd chromium andmanganese. Why aren’t they ferromagnetic? The answer is that the λ term inEq. (37.1) has the opposite sign for these elements. In the chromium lattice, forexample, the spins of the chromium atoms alternate atom by atom, as shown inFig. 37-13(b). So chromium is「magnetic」from its own point of view, but it is nottechnically interesting because there are no external magnetic eﬀects. Chromium,then, is an example of a material in which quantum mechanical eﬀects makethe spins alternate. Such a material is called antiferromagnetic. The alignmentin antiferromagnetic materials is also temperature dependent. Below a criticaltemperature, all the spins are lined up in the alternating array, but when thematerial is heated above a certain temperature—which is again called the Curietemperature—the spins suddenly become random. There is, internally, a suddentransition. This transition can be seen in the speciﬁc heat curve. Also it shows upin some special「magnetic」eﬀects. For instance, the existence of the alternatingspins can be veriﬁed by scattering neutrons from a crystal of chromium. Because37-11

Crystal structure of the min-eral spinel (MgAl2O4); the Mg+2 ions oc-cupy tetrahedral sites, each surrounded byfour oxygen ions; the Al+3 ions occupy octa-hedral sites, each surrounded by six oxygenions. [From Charles Kittel, Introduction toSolid State Physics, John Wiley and Sons,Inc., New York, 2nd ed., 1956.]

a neutron itself has a spin (and a magnetic moment), it has a diﬀerent amplitudeto be scattered, depending on whether its spin is parallel or opposite to the spinof the scatterer. Thus, we get a diﬀerent interference pattern when the spins ina crystal are alternating than we do when they have a random distribution.

There is another kind of substance in which quantum mechanical eﬀects makethe electron spins alternate, but which is nevertheless ferromagnetic—that is,the crystal has a permanent net magnetization. The idea behind such materialsis shown in Fig. 37-14. The ﬁgure shows the crystal structure of spinel, amagnesium-aluminum oxide, which—as it is shown—is not magnetic. The oxidehas two kinds of metal atoms: magnesium and aluminum. Now if we replace themagnesium and the aluminum by two magnetic elements like iron and zinc, orby zinc and manganese—in other words, if we put in magnetic atoms insteadof the nonmagnetic ones—an interesting thing happens. Let’s call one kind ofmetal atom a and the other kind of metal atom b; then the following combinationof forces must be considered. There is an a-b interaction which tries to makethe a atoms and the b atoms have opposite spins—because quantum mechanicsalways gives the opposite sign (except for the mysterious crystals of iron, nickel,and cobalt). Then, there is a direct a-a interaction which tries to make the a’sopposite, and also a b-b interaction which tries to make the b’s opposite. Now,of course we cannot have everything opposite everything else—a opposite b, aopposite a, and b opposite b. Presumably because of the distances between the a’sand the presence of the oxygen (although we really don’t know why), it turnsout that the a-b interaction is stronger than the a-a or the b-b. So the solutionthat nature uses in this case is to make all the a’s parallel to each other, andall the b’s parallel to each other, but the two systems opposite. That gives thelowest energy because of the stronger a-b interaction. The result: all the a’s arespinning up and all the b’s are spinning down—or vice versa, of course. But if themagnetic moments of the a-type atom and the b-type atom are not equal, we canget the situation shown in Fig. 37-13(c), and there can be a net magnetizationin the material. The material will then be ferromagnetic—although somewhatweak. Such materials are called ferrites. They do not have as high a saturationmagnetization as iron—for obvious reasons—so they are only useful for smallerﬁelds. But they have a very important diﬀerence—they are insulators; the ferritesare ferromagnetic insulators. In high-frequency ﬁelds, they will have very smalleddy currents and so can be used, for example, in microwave systems. Themicrowave ﬁelds will be able to get inside such an insulating material, whereasthey would be kept out by the eddy currents in a conductor like iron.

There is another class of magnetic materials which has only recently beendiscovered—members of the family of the orthosilicates called garnets. They areagain crystals in which the lattice contains two kinds of metallic atoms, and wehave again a situation in which two kinds of atoms can be substituted almost atwill. Among the many compounds of interest there is one which is completelyferromagnetic. It has yttrium and iron in the garnet structure, and the reasonit is ferromagnetic is very curious. Here again quantum mechanics is makingthe neighboring spins opposite, so that there is a locked-in system of spins withthe electron spins of the iron one way and the electron spins of the yttrium theopposite way. But the yttrium atom is complicated. It is a rare-earth elementand gets a large contribution to its magnetic moment from orbital motion of theelectrons. For yttrium, the orbital motion contribution is opposite that of thespin and also is bigger. Thus, although quantum mechanics, working throughthe exclusion principle, makes the spins of the yttrium opposite those of theiron, it makes the total magnetic moment of the yttrium atom parallel to theiron because of the orbital eﬀect—as sketched in Fig. 37-13(d). The compoundis therefore a regular ferromagnet.

Another interesting example of ferromagnetism occurs in some of the rare-earth elements. It has to do with a still more peculiar arrangement of the spins.The material is not ferromagnetic in the sense that the spins are all parallel, noris it antiferromagnetic in the sense that every atom is opposite. In these crystalsall of the spins in one layer are parallel and lie in the plane of the layer. In the37-12

next layer all spins are again parallel to each other, but point in a somewhatdiﬀerent direction. In the following layer they are in still another direction, andso on. The result is that the local magnetization vector varies in the form of aspiral—the magnetic moments of the successive layers rotate as we proceed alonga line perpendicular to the layers. It is interesting to try to analyze what happenswhen a ﬁeld is applied to such a spiral—all the twistings and turnings that mustgo on in all those atomic magnets. (Some people like to amuse themselves withthe theory of these things!) Not only are there cases of「ﬂat」spirals, but there arealso cases in which the directions the magnetic moments of successive layers mapout a cone, so that it has a spiral component and also a uniform ferromagneticcomponent in one direction!

The magnetic properties of materials, worked out on a more advanced levelthan we have been able to do here, have fascinated physicists of all kinds. In theﬁrst place, there are those practical people who love to work out ways of makingthings in a better way—they love to design better and more interesting magneticmaterials. The discovery of things like ferrites, or their application, immediatelydelights people who like to see clever new ways of doing things. Besides this, thereare those who ﬁnd a fascination in the terrible complexity that nature can produceusing a few basic laws. Starting with one and the same general idea, nature goesfrom the ferromagnetism of iron and its domains, to the antiferromagnetism ofchromium, to the magnetism of ferrites and garnets, to the spiral structure of therare earth elements, and on, and on. It is fascinating to discover experimentally allthe strange things that go on in these special substances. Then, to the theoreticalphysicists, ferromagnetism presents a number of very interesting, unsolved, andbeautiful challenges. One challenge is to understand why it exists at all. Anotheris to predict the statistics of the interacting spins in an ideal lattice. Evenneglecting any possible extraneous complications, this problem has, so far, deﬁedfull understanding. The reason that it is so interesting is that it is such an easilystated problem: Given a lot of electron spins in a regular lattice, interactingwith such-and-such a law, what do they do? It is simply stated, but it has deﬁedcomplete analysis for years. Although it has been analyzed rather carefully fortemperatures not too close to the Curie point, the theory of the sudden transitionat the Curie point still needs to be completed.

Finally, the whole subject of the system of spinning atomic magnets—inferromagnetic, or in paramagnetic materials and in nuclear magnetism, has alsobeen a fascinating thing to advanced students in physics. The system of spinscan be pushed on and pulled on with external magnetic ﬁelds, so one can domany tricks with resonances, with relaxation eﬀects, with spin-echoes, and withother eﬀects.It serves as a prototype of many complicated thermodynamicsystems. But in paramagnetic materials the situation is often fairly simple, andpeople have been delighted both to do experiments and to explain the phenomenatheoretically.

We now close our study of electricity and magnetism. In the ﬁrst chapter, wespoke of the great strides that have been made since the early Greek observation ofthe strange behaviors of amber and of lodestone. Yet in all our long and involveddiscussion we have never explained why it is that when we rub a piece of amberwe get a charge on it, nor have we explained why a lodestone is magnetized! Youmay say,「Oh, we just didn’t get the right sign.」No, it is worse than that. Evenif we did get the right sign, we would still have the question: Why is the pieceof lodestone in the ground magnetized? There is the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, ofcourse, but where does the earth’s ﬁeld come from? Nobody really knows—therehave only been some good guesses. So you see, this physics of ours is a lot offakery—we start out with the phenomena of lodestone and amber, and we end upnot understanding either of them very well. But we have learned a tremendousamount of very exciting and very practical information in the process!

Elasticity

38-1 Hooke’s lawThe

subject of elasticity deals with the behavior of those substances whichhave the property of recovering their size and shape when the forces producingdeformations are removed. We ﬁnd this elastic property to some extent in allsolid bodies. If we had the time to deal with the subject at length, we would wantto look into many things: the behavior of materials, the general laws of elasticity,the general theory of elasticity, the atomic machinery that determine the elasticproperties, and ﬁnally the limitations of elastic laws when the forces become sogreat that plastic ﬂow and fracture occur. It would take more time than we haveto cover all these subjects in detail, so we will have to leave out some things.For example, we will not discuss plasticity or the limitations of the elastic laws.(We touched on these subjects brieﬂy when we were talking about dislocations inmetals.) Also, we will not be able to discuss the internal mechanisms of elasticity—so our treatment will not have the completeness we have tried to achieve in theearlier chapters. Our aim is mainly to give you an acquaintance with some ofthe ways of dealing with such practical problems as the bending of beams.

When you push on a piece of material, it「gives」—the material is deformed.If the force is small enough, the relative displacements of the various points inthe material are proportional to the force—we say the behavior is elastic. We willdiscuss only the elastic behavior. First, we will write down the fundamental lawsof elasticity, and then we will apply them to a number of diﬀerent situations.

Suppose we take a rectangular block of material of length l, width w, andheight h, as shown in Fig. 38-1. If we pull on the ends with a force F, thenthe length increases by an amount ∆l. We will suppose in all cases that thechange in length is a small fraction of the original length. As a matter of fact, formaterials like wood and steel, the material will break if the change in length ismore than a few percent of the original length. For a large number of materials,experiments show that for suﬃciently small extensions the force is proportionalto the extension

F ∝ ∆l.

(38.1)

This relation is known as Hooke’s law.

The lengthening ∆l of the bar will also depend on its length. We can ﬁgureout how by the following argument. If we cement two identical blocks together,end to end, the same forces act on each block; each will stretch by ∆l. Thus,the stretch of a block of length 2l would be twice as big as a block of the samecross section, but of length l. In order to get a number more characteristic of thematerial, and less of any particular shape, we choose to deal with the ratio ∆l/lof the extension to the original length. This ratio is proportional to the force butindependent of l:

F ∝ ∆l

.

l

(38.2)The force F will also depend on the area of the block. Suppose that we puttwo blocks side by side. Then for a given stretch ∆l we would have the force Fon each block, or twice as much on the combination of the two blocks. Theforce, for a given amount of stretch, must be proportional to the cross-sectionalarea A of the block. To obtain a law in which the coeﬃcient of proportionality isindependent of the dimensions of the body, we write Hooke’s law for a rectangular38-1

(38.3)The constant Y is a property only of the nature of the material; it is known asYoung’s modulus. (Usually you will see Young’s modulus called E. But we’veused E for electric ﬁelds, energy, and emf’s, so we prefer to use a diﬀerent letter.)The force per unit area is called the stress, and the stretch per unit length—the fractional stretch—is called the strain. Equation (38.3) can therefore berewritten in the following way:

Stress = (Young’s modulus) × (Strain).

There is another part to Hooke’s law: When you stretch a block of materialin one direction it contracts at right angles to the stretch. The contraction inwidth is proportional to the width w and also to ∆l/l. The sideways contractionis in the same proportion for both width and height, and is usually written

where the constant σ is another property of the material called Poisson’s ratio.It is always positive in sign and is a number less than 1/2. (It is「reasonable」that σ should be generally positive, but it is not quite clear that it must be so.)The two constants Y and σ specify completely the elastic properties of ahomogeneous’ isotropic (that is, noncrystalline) material. In crystalline materialsthe stretches and contractions can be diﬀerent in diﬀerent directions, so therecan be many more elastic constants. We will restrict our discussion temporarilyto homogeneous’ isotropic materials whose properties can be described by Yand σ. As usual there are diﬀerent ways of describing things—some people liketo describe the elastic properties of materials by diﬀerent constants. It alwaystakes two, and they can be related to σ and Y .The last general law we need is the principle of superposition. Since thetwo laws (38.4) and (38.5) are linear in the forces and in the displacements,superposition will work. If you have one set of forces and get some displacements,and then you add a new set of forces and get some additional displacements, theresulting displacements will be the sum of the ones you would get with the twosets of forces acting independently.

Now we have all the general principles—the superposition principle and Eqs.(38.4) and (38.5)—and that’s all there is to elasticity. But that is like saying thatonce you have Newton’s laws that’s all there is to mechanics. Or, given Maxwell’sequations, that’s all there is to electricity. It is, of course, true that with theseprinciples you have a great deal, because with your present mathematical abilityyou could go a long way. We will, however, work out a few special applications.

38-2 Uniform strainsAs our ﬁrst example let’s ﬁnd out what happens to a rectangular block underuniform hydrostatic pressure. Let’s put a block under water in a pressure tank.Then there will be a force acting inward on every face of the block proportionalto the area (see Fig. 38-2). Since the hydrostatic pressure is uniform, the stress(force per unit area) on each face of the block is the same. We will work out ﬁrstthe change in the length. The change in length of the block can be thought of asthe sum of changes in length that would occur in the three independent problemswhich are sketched in Fig. 38-3.

Problem 1.

If we push on the ends of the block with a pressure p, the

compressional strain is p/Y , and it is negative,

∆l1l

= − pY

.

static pressure.

Fig. 38-3. Hydrostatic pressure is thesuperposition of three longitudinal compres-sions.

Problem 2. If we push on the two sides of the block with pressure p, thecompressional strain is again p/Y , but now we want the lengthwise strain. Wecan get that from the sideways strain multiplied by −σ. The sideways strain is

so

∆ww∆l2l

= − pY

.

Problem 3. If we push on the top of the block, the compressional strain is oncemore p/Y , and the corresponding strain in the sideways direction is again −σp/Y .We get

∆l3l

= +σ

pY

.

Combining the results of the three problems—that is, taking ∆l = ∆l1 +

∆l2 + ∆l3—we get

The problem is, of course, symmetrical in all three directions; it follows that

∆ll

= − pY

(1 − 2σ).

The change in the volume under hydrostatic pressure is also of some interest.

Since V = lwh, we can write, for small displacements,

Using (38.6) and (38.7), we have∆VV

People like to call ∆V /V the volume strain and write

p = −K

∆VV

.

(38.8)

The volume stress p is proportional to the volume strain—Hooke’s law once more.The coeﬃcient K is called the bulk modulus; it is related to the other constantsby

K =

Y

3(1 − 2σ) .

(38.9)

Since K is of some practical interest, many handbooks give Y and K instead ofY and σ. If you want σ you can always get it from Eq. (38.9). We can also seefrom Eq. (38.9) that Poisson’s ratio, σ, must be less than one-half. If it were not,the bulk modulus K would be negative, and the material would expand underincreasing pressure. That would allow us to get mechanical energy out of any oldblock—it would mean that the block was in unstable equilibrium. If it started toexpand it would continue by itself with a release of energy.

Now we want to consider what happens when you put a「shear」strain onsomething. By shear strain we mean the kind of distortion shown in Fig. 38-4.As a preliminary to this, let us look at the strains in a cube of material subjectedto the forces shown in Fig. 38-5. Again we can break it up into two problems:the vertical pushes, and the horizontal pulls. Calling A the area of the cube face,we have for the change in horizontal length

∆ll

The change in the vertical height is just the negative of this.

Fig. 38-6. The two pairs of shear forces in (a) produce the same stress as the

compressing and stretching forces of (b).

Now suppose we have the same cube and subject it to the shearing forcesshown in Fig. 38-6(a). Note that all the forces have to be equal if there are to beno net torques and the cube is to be in equilibrium. (Similar forces must alsoexist in Fig. 38-4, since the block is in equilibrium. They are provided throughthe「glue」that holds the block to the table.) The cube is then said to be in astate of pure shear. But note that if we cut the cube by a plane at 45◦—say alongthe diagonal A in the ﬁgure—the total force acting across the plane is normal toplane and is equal to √2G. The area over which this force acts is √2A; therefore,the tensile stress normal to this plane is simply G/A. Similarly, if we examine aplane at an angle of 45◦ the other way—the diagonal B in the ﬁgure—we seethat there is a compressional stress normal to this plane of −G/A. From this,we see that the stress in a「pure shear」is equivalent to a combination of tensionand compression stresses of equal strength and at right angles to each other, andat 45◦ to the original faces of the cube. The internal stresses and strains are thesame as we would ﬁnd in the larger block of material with the forces shown inFig. 38-6(b). But this is the problem we have already solved. The change inlength of the diagonal is given by Eq. (38.10),= 1 + σ

(One diagonal is shortened; the other is elongated.)It is often convenient to express a shear strain in terms of the angle by whichthe cube is twisted—the angle θ in Fig. 38-7. From the geometry of the ﬁgureyou can see that the horizontal shift δ of the top edge is equal to √2 ∆D. So(38.12)

Or, writing this in the form「stress = constant times strain,」

Incidentally, the shear modulus must be positive—otherwise you could get workout of a self-shearing block. From Eq. (38.14), σ must be greater than −1. Weknow, then, that σ must be between −1 and + 12; in practice, however, it is alwaysgreater than zero.As a last example of the type of situation where the stresses are uniformthrough the material, let’s consider the problem of a block which is stretched,while it is at the same time constrained so that no lateral contraction can takeplace. (Technically, it’s a little easier to compress it while keeping the sides frombulging out—but it’s the same problem.) What happens? Well, there must besideways forces which keep it from changing its thickness—forces we don’t knowoﬀ-hand but will have to calculate. It’s the same kind of problem we have alreadydone, only with a little diﬀerent algebra. We imagine forces on all three sides, asshown in Fig. 38-8; we calculate the changes in dimensions, and we choose thetransverse forces to make the width and height remain constant. Following theusual arguments, we get for the three strains:

Now since ∆ly and ∆lz are supposed to be zero, Eqs. (38.16) and (38.17) give

two equations relating Fy and Fz to Fx. Solving them together, we get that

(38.20)

When we constrain the sides, Young’s modulus gets multiplied by a complicatedfunction of σ. As you can most easily see from Eq. (38.19), the factor in frontof Y is always greater than 1. It is harder to stretch the block when the sidesare held—which also means that a block is stronger when the sides are held thanwhen they are not.

38-3 The torsion bar; shear wavesLet’s now turn our attention to an example which is more complicated becausediﬀerent parts of the material are stressed by diﬀerent amounts. We consider atwisted rod such as you would ﬁnd in a drive shaft of some machinery, or in aquartz ﬁber suspension used in a delicate instrument. As you probably knowfrom experiments with the torsion pendulum, the torque on a twisted rod isproportional to the angle—the constant of proportionality obviously dependingupon the length of the rod, on the radius of the rod, and on the properties of thematerial. The question is: In what way? We are now in a position to answer thisquestion; it’s just a matter of working out some geometry.

Fig. 38-9(a) shows a cylindrical rod of length L, and radius a, with one endtwisted by the angle φ with respect to the other. If we want to relate the strainsto what we already know, we can think of the rod as being made up of manycylindrical shells and work out separately what happens to each shell. We start38-5

Fig. 38-9. (a) A cylindrical bar in torsion. (b) A cylindrical shell in torsion. (c) Each

small piece of the shell is in shear.

by looking at a thin, short cylinder of radius r (less than a) and thickness ∆r—asdrawn in Fig. 38-9(b). Now if we look at a piece of this cylinder that was originallya small square, we see that it has been distorted into a parallelogram. Each suchelement of the cylinder is in shear, and the shear angle θ is

The shear stress g in the material is, therefore [from Eq. (38.13)],

θ = rφL

.

g = µθ = µ

.

(38.21)

rφL

The shear stress is the tangential force ∆F on the end of the square divided

by the area ∆l ∆r of the end [see Fig. 38-9(c)]

g = ∆F∆l ∆r

.

The force ∆F on the end of such a square contributes a torque ∆τ around theaxis of the rod equal to

∆τ = r ∆F = rg ∆l ∆r.

(38.22)The total torque τ is the sum of such torques around a complete circumference ofthe cylinder. So putting together enough pieces so that the ∆l’s add up to 2πr,we ﬁnd that the total torque, for a hollow tube, is

Or, using (38.21),

rg(2πr) ∆r.

τ = 2πµ

r3 ∆rφ

L

.

(38.23)

(38.24)

We get that the rotational stiﬀness, τ /φ, of a hollow tube is proportional to thecube of the radius r and to the thickness ∆r, and inversely proportional to thelength L.We can now imagine a solid rod to be made up of a series of concentric tubes,each twisted by the same angle φ (although the internal stresses are diﬀerent foreach tube). The total torque is the sum of the torques required to rotate eachshell; for the solid rod

τ = 2πµ

where the integral goes from r = 0 to r = a, the radius of the rod. Integrating,we have

(38.25)

38-6

For a rod in torsion, the torque is proportional to the angle and is proportionalto the fourth power of the diameter—a rod twice as thick is sixteen times as stiﬀfor torsion.Before leaving the subject of torsion, let us apply what we have just learned toan interesting problem: torsional waves. If you take a long rod and suddenly twistone end, a wave of twist works it way along the rod, as sketched in Fig. 38-10(a).That’s a little more exciting than a steady twist—let’s see whether we can workout what happens.

Fig. 38-10. (a) A torsional wave on a rod. (b) A volume element of the rod.

Let z be the distance to some point down the rod. For a static torsion thetorque is the same everywhere along the rod, and is proportional to φ/L, thetotal torsion angle over the total length. What matters to the material is thelocal torsional strain, which is, you will appreciate, ∂φ/∂z. When the torsionalong the rod is not uniform, we should replace Eq. (38.25) by

τ(z) = µ

πa42

∂φ∂z

.

(38.26)

Now let’s look at what happens to an element of length ∆z shown magniﬁed inFig. 38-10(b). There is a torque τ(z) at end 1 of the little hunk of rod, and adiﬀerent torque τ(z + ∆z) at end 2. If ∆z is small enough, we can use a Taylorexpansion and write

(cid:18) ∂τ

(cid:19)

∂z

τ(z + ∆z) = τ(z) +

∆z.

(38.27)

The net torque ∆τ acting on the little piece of rod between z and z + ∆zis clearly the diﬀerence between τ(z) and τ(z + ∆z), or ∆τ = (∂τ /∂z) ∆z.Diﬀerentiating Eq. (38.26), we get

∆τ = µ

πa42

∂2φ∂z2

∆z.

(38.28)

The eﬀect of this net torque is to give an angular acceleration to the little

slice of the rod. The mass of the slice is

∆M = (πa2 ∆z)ρ,

where ρ is the density of the material. We worked out in Chapter 19, Vol. I,that the moment of inertia of a circular cylinder is mr2/2; calling the moment ofinertia of our piece ∆I, we have

∆I = π

2 ρa4 ∆z.

(38.29)

Newton’s law says the torque is equal to the moment of inertia times the angularacceleration, or

∆τ = ∆I

∂2φ∂t2 .

Pulling everything together, we get∂2φ∂z2

or

(38.31)

You will recognize this as the one-dimensional wave equation. We have foundthat waves of torsion will propagate down the rod with the speed

r µ

Cshear =

.

(38.32)

The denser the rod—for the same stiﬀness—the slower the waves; and the stiﬀerthe rod, the quicker the waves work their way down. The speed does not dependupon the diameter of the rod.Torsional waves are a special example of shear waves. In general, shear wavesare those in which the strains do not change the volume of any part of the material.In torsional waves, we have a particular distribution of such shear stresses—namely,distributed on a circle. But for any arrangement of shear stresses, waves willpropagate with the same speed—the one given in Eq. (38.32). For example, theseismologists ﬁnd such shear waves travelling in the interior of the earth.

We can have another kind of a wave in the elastic world inside a solidmaterial. If you push something, you can start「longitudinal」waves—also called「compressional」waves. They are like the sound waves in air or in water—thedisplacements are in the same direction as the wave propagation. (At the surfacesof an elastic body there can also be other types of waves—called「Rayleigh waves」or「Love waves.」In them, the strains are neither purely longitudinal nor purelytransverse. We will not have time to study them.)

While we’re on the subject of waves, what is the velocity of the pure com-pressional waves in a large solid body like the earth? We say「large」because thespeed of sound in a thick body is diﬀerent from what it is, for instance, along athin rod. By a「thick」body we mean one in which the transverse dimensions aremuch larger than the wavelength of the sound. Then, when we push on the object,it cannot expand sideways—it can only compress in one dimension. Fortunately,we have already worked out the special case of the compression of a constrainedelastic material. We have also worked out in Chapter 47, Vol. I, the speed ofsound waves in a gas. Following the same arguments you can see that the speed

of sound in a solid is equal topY 0/ρ, where Y 0 is the「longitudinal modulus」—or

pressure divided by the relative change in length—for the constrained case. Thisis just the ratio of ∆l/l to F/A we got in Eq. (38.20). So the speed of thelongitudinal waves is given by

long = Y 0C2

ρ

=

1 − σ

(1 + σ)(1 − 2σ)

Yρ

.

(38.33)

So long as σ is between zero and 1/2, the shear modulus µ is less than Young’s

modulus Y , and also Y 0 is greater than Y , soµ < Y < Y 0.

This means that longitudinal waves travel faster than shear waves. One ofthe most precise ways of measuring the elastic constants of a substance is bymeasuring the density of the material and the speeds of the two kinds of waves.From this information one can get both Y and σ. It is, incidentally, by measuringthe diﬀerence in the arrival times of the two kinds of waves from an earthquakethat a seismologist can estimate—even from the signals at only one station—thedistance to the quake.

38-4 The bent beamWe want now to look at another practical matter—the bending of a rod or abeam. What are the forces when we bend a bar of some arbitrary cross section?We will work it out thinking of a bar with a circular cross section, but our answer38-8

will be good for any shape. To save time, however, we will cut some corners, soour theory we will work out is only approximate. Our results will be correct onlywhen the radius of the bend is much larger than the thickness of the beam.

Suppose you grab the two ends of a straight bar and bend it into some curvelike the one shown in Fig. 38-11. What goes on inside the bar? Well, if it iscurved, that means that the material on the inside of the curve is compressedand the material on the outside is stretched. There is some surface which goesalong more or less parallel to the axis of the bar that is neither stretched norcompressed. This is called the neutral surface. You would expect this surfaceto be near the「middle」of the cross section. It can be shown (but we won’tdo it here) that, for small bending of simple beams, the neutral surface goesthrough the「center of gravity」of the cross section. This is true only for「pure」bending—if you are not stretching or compressing the beam at the same time.For pure bending, then, a thin transverse slice of the bar is distorted as shownin Fig. 38-12(a). The material below the neutral surface has a compressionalstrain which is proportional to the distance from the neutral surface; and thematerial above is stretched, also in proportion to its distance from the neutralsurface. So the longitudinal stretch ∆l is proportional to the height y. Theconstant of proportionality is just l over the radius of curvature of the bar—seeFig. 38-12:

∆ll

= yR

.

Z

So the force per unit area—the stress—in a small strip at y is also proportionalto the distance from the neutral surface

∆F∆A

= Y

yR

.

(38.34)

Now let’s look at the forces that would produce such a strain. The forcesacting on the little segment drawn in Fig. 38-12 are shown in the ﬁgure. If wethink of any transverse cut, the forces acting across it are one way above theneutral surface and the other way below. They come in pairs to make a「bendingmoment」M—by which we mean the torque about the neutral line. We cancompute the total moment by integrating the force times the distance from theneutral surface for one of the faces of the segment of Fig. 38-12:

M =

y dF.

(38.35)

crosssect

From Eq. (38.34), dF = Y y/R dA, so

M = YR

Z

y2 dA.

The integral of y2 dA is what we can call the「moment of inertia」of the geometriccross section about a horizontal axis through its「center of mass」;* we will callit I:

(38.36)

M = Y IR

Z

I =

y2 dA.

(38.37)

Equation (38.36), then, gives us the relation between the bending moment Mand the curvature 1/R of the beam. The「stiﬀness」of the beam is proportionalto Y and to the moment of inertia I. In other words, if you want the stiﬀestpossible beam with a given amount of, say, aluminum, you want to put as much ofit as possible as far as you can from the neutral surface, to make a large momentof inertia. You can’t carry this to an extreme, however, because then the thing

* It is, of course, really the moment of inertia of a slice with unit mass per unit area.

38-9

beam. (b) Cross section of the beam.

will not curve as we have supposed—it will buckle or twist and become weakeragain. But now you see why structural beams are made in the form of an I or anH—as shown in Fig. 38-13.

As an example of the use of our beam equation (38.36), let’s work out thedeﬂection of a cantilevered beam with a concentrated force W acting at the freeend, as sketched in Fig. 38-14. (By「cantilevered」we simply mean that the beamis supported in such a way that both the position and the slope are ﬁxed at oneend—it is stuck into a cement wall.) What is the shape of the beam? Let’s callthe deﬂection at the distance x from the ﬁxed end z; we want to know z(x). We’llwork it out only for small deﬂections. We will also assume that the beam is longin comparison with its cross section. Now, as you know from your mathematicscourses, the curvature 1/R of any curve z(x) is given by

1R

=

d2z/dx2

[1 + (dz/dx)2]3/2 .

(38.38)

Since we are interested only in small slopes—this is usually the case in engineeringstructures—we neglect (dz/dx)2 in comparison with 1, and take

1R

= d2zdx2 .

(38.39)

We also need to know the bending moment M. It is a function of x because itis equal to the torque about the neutral axis of any cross section. Let’s neglectthe weight of the beam and take only the downward force W at the end of thebeam. (You can put in the beam weight yourself if you want.) Then the bendingmoment at x is

M(x) = W(L − x),

because that is the torque about the point at x, exerted by the weight W—thetorque which the beam must support of x. We get

Fig. 38-13. An「I」beam.

weight at one end.

or

W(L − x) = Y IR

= Y I

d2zdx2

d2zdx2

(L − x).

This one we can integrate without any tricks; we get

(cid:18) Lx22 − x36

(cid:19)

,

z = WY I

(38.40)

(38.41)

using our assumptions that z(0) = 0 and that dz/dx is also zero at x = 0. Thatis the shape of the beam. The displacement of the end is

z(L) = WY I

L33 ;

(38.42)

the displacement of the end of a beam increases as the cube of the length.

In deriving our approximate beam theory, we have assumed that the crosssection of the beam did not change when the beam was bent. When the thicknessof the beam is small compared to the radius of curvature, the cross sectionchanges very little and our result is O.K. In general, however, this eﬀect cannotbe neglected, as you can easily demonstrate for yourselves by bending a soft-rubber eraser in your ﬁngers. If the cross section was originally rectangular,you will ﬁnd that when it is bent it bulges at the bottom (see Fig. 38-15). Thishappens because when we compress the bottom, the material expands sideways—as described by Poisson’s ratio. Rubber is easy to bend or stretch, but it issomewhat like a liquid in that it’s hard to change the volume—as shows up nicelywhen you bend the eraser. For an incompressible material, Poisson’s ratio wouldbe exactly 1/2—for rubber it is nearly that.

38-10

section.

38-5 BucklingWe want now to use our beam theory to understand the theory of the「buckling」of beams, or columns, or rods. Consider the situation sketched in Fig. 38-16 inwhich a rod that would normally be straight is held in its bent shape by twoopposite forces that push on the ends of the rod. We would like to calculate theshape of the rod and the magnitude of the forces on the ends.Let the deﬂection of the rod from the straight line between the ends be y(x),where x is the distance from one end. The bending moment M at the point P inthe ﬁgure is equal to the force F multiplied by the moment arm, which is theperpendicular distance y,(38.43)

M(x) = F y.

Using the beam equation (38.36), we have

= F y.

Y IR

(38.44)

Fig. 38-16. A buckled beam.

For small deﬂections, we can take 1/R = −d2y/dx2 (the minus sign because thecurvature is downward). We get

d2ydx2

= − FY I

y,

(38.45)

which is the diﬀerential equation of a sine wave. So for small deﬂections, thecurve of such a bent beam is a sine curve. The「wavelength」λ of the sine waveis twice the distance L between the ends. If the bending is small, this is justtwice the unbent length of the rod. So the curve is

Taking the second derivative, we get

y = K sin πx/L.

Comparing this to Eq. (38.45), we see that the force is

d2ydx2

= − π2

L2 y.

F = π2 Y IL2 .

(38.46)

For small bendings the force is independent of the bending displacement y!We have, then, the following thing physically. If the force is less than the Fgiven in Eq. (38.46), there will be no bending at all. But if it is slightly greaterthan this force, the material will suddenly bend a large amount—that is, forforces above the critical force π2Y I/L2 (often called the「Euler force」the beamwill「buckle.」If the loading on the second ﬂoor of a building exceeds the Eulerforce」for the supporting columns, the building will collapse. Another placewhere the buckling force is most important is in space rockets. On one hand,the rocket must be able to hold its own weight on the launching pad and endurethe stresses during acceleration; on the other hand, it is important to keep theweight of the structure to a minimum, so that the payload and fuel capacity maybe made as large as possible.

Actually a beam will not necessarily collapse completely when the forceexceeds the Euler force. When the displacements get large, the force is largerthan what we have found because of the terms in 1/R in Eq. (38.38) that wehave neglected. To ﬁnd the forces for a large bending of the beam, we have togo back to the exact equation, Eq. (38.44), which we had before we used theapproximate relation between R and y. Equation (38.44) has a rather simplegeometrical property.* It’s a little complicated to work out, but rather interesting.

* The same equation appears, incidentally, in other physical situations—for example, themeniscus at the surface of a liquid contained between parallel planes—and the same geometricalsolution can be used.

Instead of describing the curve in terms of x and y, we can use two new variables:S, the distance along the curve, and θ the slope of the tangent to the curve. SeeFig. 38-17. The curvature is the rate of change of angle with distance:

We can, therefore write the exact equation (38.44) as

If we take the derivative of this equation with respect to S and replace dy/dSby sin θ, we get

[If θ is small, we get back Eq. (38.45). Everything is O.K.]Now it may or may not delight you to know that Eq. (38.47) is exactly thesame one you get for the large amplitude oscillations of a pendulum—with F/Y Ireplaced by another constant, of course. We learned way back in Chapter 9,Vol. I, how to ﬁnd the solution of such an equation by a numerical calculation.*The answers you get are some fascinating curves—known as the curves of the「Elastica.」Figure 38-18 shows three curves for diﬀerent values of F/Y I.

Elastic Materials

39-1 The tensor of strainIn

the last chapter we talked about the distortions of particular elastic objects.In this chapter we want to look at what can happen in general inside an elasticmaterial. We would like to be able to describe the conditions of stress and straininside some big glob of jello which is twisted and squashed in some complicatedway. To do this, we need to be able to describe the local strain at every pointin an elastic body; we can do it by giving a set of six numbers—which are thecomponents of a symmetric tensor—for each point. Earlier, we spoke of the stresstensor (Chapter 31); now we need the tensor of strain.

Imagine that we start with the material initially unstrained and watch themotion of a small speck of「dirt」embedded in the material when the strain isapplied.A speck that was at the point P located at r = (x, y, z) moves to a newposition P 0 at r0 = (x0, y0, z0) as shown in Fig. 39-1. We will call u the vectordisplacements from P to P 0. Then

u = r0 − r.

(39.1)The displacement u depends, of course, on which point P we start with, so u isa vector function of r—or, if you prefer, of (x, y, z).Let’s look ﬁrst at a simple situation in which the strain is constant over thematerial—so we have what is called a homogeneous strain. Suppose, for instance,that we have a block of material and we stretch it uniformly. We just changeits dimensions uniformly in one direction—say, in the x-direction, as shown inFig. 39-2. The motion ux of a speck at x is proportional to x. In fact,

We will write ux this way:

= ∆l

l

.

uxx

ux = exxx.

The proportionality constant exx is, of course, the same thing as ∆l/l. (You willsee shortly why we use a double subscript.)

strain.

39-1

If the strain is not uniform, the relation between ux and x will vary fromplace to place in the material. For the general situation, we deﬁne the exx by akind of local ∆l/l, namely by

(39.2)This number—which is now a function of x, y, and z—describes the amount ofstretching in the x-direction throughout the hunk of jello. There may, of course,also be stretching in the y- and z-directions. We describe them by the numbers

exx = ∂ux/∂x.

eyy = ∂uy∂y

,

ezz = ∂uz∂z

.

(39.3)

We need to be able to describe also the shear-type strains. Suppose weimagine a little cube marked out in the initially undisturbed jello. When thejello is pushed out of shape, this cube may get changed into a parallelogram, assketched in Fig. 39-3.* In this kind of a strain, the x-motion of each particle isproportional to its y-coordinate,

And there is also a y-motion proportional to x,

ux = θ

2 y.

So we can describe such a shear-type strain by writing

uy = θ

2 x.

with

ux = exyy,

uy = eyxx

exy = eyx = θ2 .

(39.4)

(39.5)

Now you might think that when the strains are not homogeneous we coulddescribe the generalized shear strains by deﬁning the quantities exy and eyx by(39.6)

exy = ∂ux∂y

,

eyx = ∂uy∂x

.

Fig. 39-3. A homogenous shear strain.

But there is one diﬃculty. Suppose that the displacements ux and uy were givenby

ux = θ

2 y,

uy = − θ2 x

* We choose for the moment to split the total shear angle θ into two equal parts and make

the strain symmetric with respect to x and y.

39-2

Fig. 39-4. A homogenous rotation—there is no strain.

They are like Eqs. (39.4) and (39.5) except that the sign of uy is reversed. Withthese displacements a little cube in the jello simply gets shifted by the angle θ/2,as shown in Fig. 39-4. There is no strain at all—just a rotation in space. Thereis no distortion of the material; the relative positions of all the atoms are notchanged at all. We must somehow make our deﬁnitions so that pure rotations arenot included in our deﬁnitions of a shear strain. The key point is that if ∂uy/∂xand ∂ux/∂y are equal and opposite, there is no strain; so we can ﬁx things up bydeﬁning

exy = eyx = 1

2(∂uy/∂x + ∂ux/∂y).

For a pure rotation they are both zero, but for a pure shear we get that exy isequal to eyx, as we would like.In the most general distortion—which may include stretching or compressionas well as shear—we deﬁne the state of strain by giving the nine numbers

,

,

exx = ∂ux∂xeyy = ∂uy∂y...2(∂uy/∂x + ∂ux/∂y),...

exy = 1

(39.7)

These are the terms of a tensor of strain. Because it is a symmetric tensor—ourdeﬁnitions make exy = eyx, always—there are really only six diﬀerent numbers.You remember (see Chapter 31) that the general characteristic of a tensor is thatthe terms transform like the products of the components of two vectors. (If Aand B are vectors, Cij = AiBj is a tensor.) Each term of eij is a product (or thesum of such products) of the components of the vector u = (ux, uy, uz), and ofthe operator ∇ = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z), which we know transforms like a vector.Let’s let x1, x2, and x3 stand for x, y, and z and u1, u2, and u3 stand for ux, uy,and uz; then we can write the general term eij of the strain tensor as

eij = 1where i and j can be 1, 2, or 3.and shear—all of the eij are constants, and we can write

2(∂uj/∂xi + ∂ui/∂xj),

When we have a homogeneous strain—which may include both stretching

(39.8)

ux = exxx + exyy + exzz.

(39.9)(We choose our origin of x, y, z at the point where u is zero.) In this case,the strain tensor eij gives the relationship between two vectors: the coordinatevector r = (x, y, z) and the displacement vector u = (ux, uy, uz).

39-3

When the strains are not homogeneous, any piece of the jello may also getsomewhat twisted—there will be a local rotation. If the distortions are all small,we would have

(eij − ωij) ∆xj,

(39.10)

∆ui =X

where ωij is an antisymmetric tensor,

j

(39.11)which describes the rotation. We will, however, not worry any more aboutrotations, but only about the strains described by the symmetric tensor eij.

2(∂uj/∂xi − ∂ui/∂xj),

ωij = 1

39-2 The tensor of elasticityNow that we have described the strains, we want to relate them to the internalforces—the stresses in the material. For each small piece of the material, weassume Hooke’s law holds and write that the stresses are proportional to thestrains. In Chapter 31 we deﬁned the stress tensor Sij as the ith component of theforce across a unit-area perpendicular to the j-axis. Hooke’s law says that eachcomponent of Sij is linearly related to each of the components of strain. SinceS and e each have nine components, there are 9 × 9 = 81 possible coeﬃcientswhich describe the elastic properties of the material. They are constants if thematerial itself is homogeneous. We write these coeﬃcients as Cijkl and deﬁnethem by the equation(39.12)

Sij =X

Cijklekl,

k,l

where i, j, k, l all take on the values 1, 2, or 3. Since the coeﬃcients Cijkl relateone tensor to another, they also form a tensor—a tensor of the fourth rank. Wecan call it the tensor of elasticity.Suppose that all the C’s are known and that you put a complicated force onan object of some peculiar shape. There will be all kinds of distortion, and thething will settle down with some twisted shape. What are the displacements?You can see that it is a complicated problem. If you knew the strains, you couldﬁnd the stresses from Eq. (39.12)—or vice versa. But the stresses and strains youend up with at any point depend on what happens in all the rest of the material.The easiest way to get at the problem is by thinking of the energy. When thereis a force F proportional to a displacement x, say F = kx, the work required forany displacement x is kx2/2. In a similar way, the work w that goes into eachunit volume of a distorted material turns out to be

X

ijkl

X

Z

w = 12

Cijkleijekl.

(39.13)

The total work W done in distorting the body is the integral of w over its volume:

W =

12

Cijkleijekl dV.

(39.14)

ijkl

This is then the potential energy stored in the internal stresses of the material.Now when a body is in equilibrium, this internal energy must be at a minimum.So the problem of ﬁnding the strains in a body can be solved by ﬁnding the setof displacements u throughout the body which will make W a minimum. InChapter 19 we gave some of the general ideas of the calculus of variations thatare used in tackling minimization problems like this. We cannot go into theproblem in any more detail here.

What we are mainly interested in now is what we can say about the generalproperties of the tensor of elasticity. First, it is clear that there are not really81 diﬀerent terms in Cijkl. Since both Sij and eij are symmetric tensors, eachwith only six diﬀerent terms, there can be at most 36 diﬀerent terms in Cijkl.There are, however, usually many fewer than this.

39-4

Let’s look at the special case of a cubic crystal. In it, the energy density w

starts out like this:w = 1

2{Cxxxxe2

(cid:17)

+ . . . etc . . . etc . . .},

(39.15)with 81 terms in all! Now a cubic crystal has certain symmetries. In particular,if the crystal is rotated 90◦, it has the same physical properties. It has thesame stiﬀness for stretching in the y-direction as for stretching in the x-direction.Therefore, if we change our deﬁnition of the coordinate directions x and y inEq. (39.15), the energy wouldn’t change. It must be that for a cubic crystal

yy

Cxxxx = Cyyyy = Czzzz.

(39.16)Next we can show that the terms like Cxxxy must be zero. A cubic crystal hasthe property that it is symmetric under a reﬂection about any plane perpendicularto one of the axes. If we replace y by −y, nothing is diﬀerent. But changingy to −y changes exy to −exy—a displacement which was toward +y is nowtoward −y. If the energy is not to change, Cxxxy must go into −Cxxxy when wemake a reﬂection. But a reﬂected crystal is the same as before, so Cxxxy mustbe the same as −Cxxxy. This can happen only if both are zero.You say,「But the same argument will make Cyyyy = 0!」No, because there arefour y’s. The sign changes once for each y, and four minuses make a plus. If thereare two or four y’s, the term does not have to be zero. It is zero only when there isone, or three. So, for a cubic crystal, any nonzero term of C will have only an evennumber of identical subscripts. (The arguments we have made for y obviouslyhold also for x and z.) We might then have terms like Cxxyy, Cxyxy, Cxyyx, andso on. We have already shown, however, that if we change all x’s to y’s and viceversa (or all z’s and x’s, and so on) we must get—for a cubic crystal—the samenumber. This means that there are only three diﬀerent nonzero possibilities:

Cxxxx (= Cyyyy = Czzzz),Cxxyy (= Cyyxx = Cxxzz, etc.),Cxyxy (= Cyxyx = Cxzxz, etc.).

For a cubic crystal, then, the energy density will look like this:

(39.17)

(39.18)

For an isotropic—that is, noncrystalline—material, the symmetry is stillhigher. The C’s must be the same for any choice of the coordinate system. Thenit turns out that there is another relation among the C’s, namely, that

Cxxxx = Cxxyy + 2Cxyxy.

(39.19)We can see that this is so by the following general argument. The stress tensor Sijhas to be related to eij in a way that doesn’t depend at all on the coordinatedirections—it must be related only by scalar quantities.「That’s easy,」you say.「The only way to obtain Sij from eij is by multiplication by a scalar constant.It’s just Hooke’s law. It must be that Sij = (const)eij.」But that’s not quiteright; there could also be the unit tensor δij multiplied by some scalar, linearly(It transforms like x2 + y2 + z2, which is a scalar.) So the most general form forthe equation relating Sij to eij—for isotropic materials—is

related to eij. The only invariant you can make that is linear in the e’s isP eii.

Sij = 2µeij + λ

ekk

δij.

(39.20)

(The ﬁrst constant is usually written as two times µ; then the coeﬃcient µ is39-5

k

equal to the shear modulus we deﬁned in the last chapter.) The constants µ and λare called the Lamé elastic constants. Comparing Eq. (39.20) with Eq. (39.12),you see that

Cxxyy = λ,Cxyxy = µ,Cxxxx = 2µ + λ.

(39.21)

So we have proved that Eq. (39.19) is indeed true. You also see that the elasticproperties of an isotropic material are completely given by two constants, as wesaid in the last chapter.

The C’s can be put in terms of any two of the elastic constants we have usedearlier—for instance, in terms of Young’s modulus Y and Poisson’s ratio σ. Wewill leave it for you to show that

39-3 The motions in an elastic bodyWe have pointed out that for an elastic body in equilibrium the internalstresses adjust themselves to make the energy a minimum. Now we take a lookat what happens when the internal forces are not in equilibrium. Let’s say wehave a small piece of the material inside some surface A. See Fig. 39-5. If thepiece is in equilibrium, the total force F acting on it must be zero. We can thinkof this force as being made up of two parts. There could be one part due to「external」forces like gravity, which act from a distance on the matter in the pieceto produce a force per unit volume f ext. The total external force F ext is theintegral of f ext over the volume of the piece:

Z

F ext =

f ext dV.

(39.23)

Fig. 39-5. A small volume element V

bounded by the surface A.

In equilibrium, this force would be balanced by the total force F int from theneighboring material which acts across the surface A. When the piece is not inequilibrium—if it is moving—the sum of the internal and external forces is equalto the mass times the acceleration. We would haveρ¨r dV,

F ext + F int =

(39.24)

Z

where ρ is the density of the material, and ¨r is its acceleration. We can nowcombine Eqs. (39.23) and (39.24), writing

Z

v

F int =

(−f ext + ρ¨r) dV.

We will simplify our writing by deﬁning

Then Eq. (39.25) is written

f = −f ext + ρ¨r.

F int =

f dV.

Z

(39.25)

(39.26)

(39.27)

What we have called F int is related to the stresses in the material. The stresstensor Sij was deﬁned (Chapter 31) so that the x-component of the force dFacross a surface element da, whose unit normal is n, is given by

v

dFx = (Sxxnx + Sxyny + Sxznz) da.

(39.28)39-6

Z

The x-component of F int on our little piece is then the integral of dFx over thesurface. Substituting this into the x-component of Eq. (39.27), we get

(Sxxnx + Sxyny + Sxznz) da =

fx dV.

(39.29)

A

v

We have a surface integral related to a volume integral—and that reminds usof something we learned in electricity. Note that if you ignore the ﬁrst subscript xon each of the S’s in the left-hand side of Eq. (39.29), it looks just like the integralof a quantity「S」·n—that is, the normal component of a vector—over the surface.It would be the ﬂux of「S」out of the volume. And this could be written, usingGauss law, as the volume integral of the divergence of「S」. It is, in fact, truewhether the x-subscript is there or not—it is just a mathematical theorem youget by integrating by parts. In other words, we can change Eq. (39.29) into

Z

(cid:18) ∂Sxx

∂x

v

(cid:19)

+ ∂Sxy∂y

+ ∂Sxz∂z

dV =

(39.30)

Z

Z

v

Now we can leave oﬀ the volume integrals and write the diﬀerential equation forthe general component of f as

fi =X

j

∂Sij∂xj

.

(39.31)

This tells us how the force per unit volume is related to the stress tensor Sij.The theory of the motions inside a solid works this way. If we start out knowingthe initial displacements—given by, say, u—we can work out the strains eij. Fromthe strains we can get the stresses from Eq. (39.12). From the stresses we canget the force density f in Eq. (39.31). Knowing f, we can get, from Eq. (39.26),the acceleration ¨r of the material, which tells us how the displacements will bechanging. Putting everything together, we get the horrible equation of motion foran elastic solid. We will just write down the results that come out for an isotropicmaterial. If you use (39.20) for Sij, and write the eij as 12(∂ui/∂xj + ∂uj/∂xi),you end up with the vector equation

f = (λ + µ)∇(∇ · u) + µ∇2u.

(39.32)

You can, in fact, see that the equation relating f and u must have this form.The force must depend on the second derivatives of the displacements u. Whatsecond derivatives of u are there that are vectors? One is ∇(∇· u); that’s a truevector. The only other one is ∇2u. So the most general form is

f = a∇(∇ · u) + b∇2u,

which is just (39.32) with a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the constants. You may bewondering why we don’t have a third term using ∇ × ∇ × u, which is also avector. But remember that ∇ × ∇ × u is the same thing as ∇(∇ · u) − ∇2u,so it is a linear combination of the two terms we have. Adding it would addnothing new. We have proved once more that isotropic material has only twoelastic constants.

For the equation of motion of the material, we can set (39.32) equal to

ρ ∂2u/∂t2—neglecting for now any body forces like gravity—and get

∂2u∂t2

ρ

= (λ + µ)∇(∇ · u) + µ∇2u.

(39.33)

It looks something like the wave equation we had in electromagnetism, except thatthere is an additional complicating term. For materials whose elastic propertiesare everywhere the same we can see what the general solutions look like in thefollowing way. You will remember that any vector ﬁeld can be written as thesum of two vectors: one whose divergence is zero, and the other whose curl is39-7

zero. In other words, we can put

where

u = u1 + u2,

∇ · u1 = 0,

∇ × u2 = 0.

Substituting u1 + u2 for u in (39.33), we get

ρ ∂2/∂t2[u1 + u2] = (λ + µ)∇(∇ · u2) + µ∇2(u1 + u2).We can eliminate u1 by taking the divergence of this equation,

ρ ∂2/∂t2(∇ · u2) = (λ + µ)∇2(∇ · u2) + µ∇ · ∇2(u2).

(39.34)

(39.35)

(39.36)

Since the operators (∇2) and (∇·) can be interchanged, we can factor out thedivergence to get

∇ · {ρ ∂2u2/∂t2 − (λ + 2µ)∇2u2} = 0.

(39.37)Since ∇ × u2 is zero by deﬁnition, the curl of the bracket {} is also zero; so thebracket itself is identically zero, and

ρ ∂2u2/∂t2 = (λ + 2µ)∇2u2.

p(λ + 2µ)/ρ. Since the curl of u2 is zero, there is no shearing associated with

(39.38)This is the vector wave equation for waves which move at the speed C2 =this wave; this wave is just the compressional—sound-type—wave we discussedin the last chapter, and the velocity is just what we found for Clong.satisﬁes the equation

ρ ∂2u1/∂t2 = µ∇2u1.

In a similar way—by taking the curl of Eq. (39.36)—we can show that u1(39.39)

This is again a vector wave equation for waves with the speed C2 =pµ/ρ. Since

∇ · u1 is zero, u1 produces no changes in density; the vector u1 corresponds tothe transverse, or shear-type, wave we saw in the last chapter, and C2 = Cshear.If we wished to know the static stresses in an isotropic material, we could,in principle, ﬁnd them by solving Eq. (39.32) with f equal to zero—or equalto the static body forces from gravity such as ρg—under certain conditionswhich are related to the forces acting on the surfaces of our large block ofmaterial. This is somewhat more diﬃcult to do than the corresponding problemsin electromagnetism. It is more diﬃcult, ﬁrst, because the equations are a littlemore diﬃcult to handle, and second, because the shape of the elastic bodies we arelikely to be interested in are usually much more complicated. In electromagnetism,we are often interested in solving Maxwell’s equations around relatively simplegeometric shapes such as cylinders, spheres, and so on, since these are convenientshapes for electrical devices. In elasticity, the objects we would like to analyze mayhave quite complicated shapes—like a crane hook, or an automobile crankshaft,or the rotor of a gas turbine. Such problems can sometimes be worked outapproximately by numerical methods, using the minimum energy principle wementioned earlier. Another way is to use a model of the object and measure theinternal strains experimentally, using polarized light.

It works this way: When a transparent isotropic material—for example, aclear plastic like lucite—is put under stress, it becomes birefringent. If you putpolarized light through it, the plane of polarization will be rotated by an amountrelated to the stress: by measuring the rotation, you can measure the stress.Figure 39-6 shows how such a setup might look. Figure 39-7 is a photograph ofa photoelastic model of a complicated shape under stress.

39-4 Nonelastic behaviorIn all that has been said so far, we have assumed that stress is proportionalto strain; in general, that is not true. Figure 39-8 shows a typical stress-strain39-8

curve for a ductile material. For small strains, the stress is proportional to thestrain. Eventually, however, after a certain point, the relationship between stressand strain begins to deviate from a straight line. For many materials—the oneswe would call「brittle」—the object breaks for strains only a little above the pointwhere the curve starts to bend over. In general, there are other complications inthe stress-strain relationship. For example, if you strain an object, the stressesmay be high at ﬁrst, but decrease slowly with time. Also if you go to high stresses,but still not to the「breaking」point, when you lower the strain the stress willreturn along a diﬀerent curve. There is a small hysteresis eﬀect (like the one wesaw between B and H in magnetic materials).

The stress at which a material will break varies widely from one material toanother. Some materials will break when the maximum tensile stress reaches acertain value. Other materials will fail when the maximum shear stress reachesa certain value. Chalk is an example of a material which is much weaker intension than in shear. If you pull on the ends of a piece of blackboard chalk, thechalk will break perpendicular to the direction of the applied stress, as shownin Fig. 39-9(a). It breaks perpendicular to the applied force because it is only abunch of particles packed together which are easily pulled apart. The materialis, however, much harder to shear, because the particles get in each other’s way.Now you will remember that when we had a rod in torsion there was a shearall around it. Also, we showed that a shear was equivalent to a combinationof a tension and compression at 45◦. For these reasons, if you twist a pieceof blackboard chalk, it will break along a complicated surface which starts outat 45◦ to the axis. A photograph of a piece of chalk broken in this way is shownin Fig. 39-9(b). The chalk breaks where the material is in maximum tension.

Other materials behave in strange and complicated ways. The more compli-cated the materials are, the more interesting their behavior. If we take a sheet of「Saran-Wrap」and crumple it up into a ball and throw it on the table, it slowlyunfolds itself and returns toward its original ﬂat form. At ﬁrst sight, we might betempted to think that it is inertia which prevents it from returning to its originalform. However, a simple calculation shows that the inertia is several orders ofmagnitude too small to account for the eﬀect. There appear to be two importantcompeting eﬀects:「something」inside the material「remembers」the shape ithad initially and「tries」to get back there, but something else「prefers」the newshape and「resists」the return to the old shape.

We will not attempt to describe the mechanism at play in the Saran plastic,but you can get an idea of how such an eﬀect might come about from the followingmodel. Suppose you imagine a material made of long, ﬂexible, but strong, ﬁbersmixed together with some hollow cells ﬁlled with a viscous liquid. Imagine alsothat there are narrow pathways from one cell to the next so the liquid can leakslowly from a cell to its neighbor. When we crumple a sheet of this stuﬀ, wedistort the long ﬁbers, squeezing the liquid out of the cells in one place andforcing it into other cells which are being stretched. When we let go, the long39-9

ﬁbers try to return to their original shape. But to do this, they have to force theliquid back to its original location—which will happen relatively slowly becauseof the viscosity. The forces we apply in crumpling the sheet are much largerthan the forces exerted by the ﬁbers. We can crumple the sheet quickly, but itwill return more slowly. It is undoubtedly a combination of large stiﬀ moleculesand smaller, movable ones in the Saran-Wrap that is responsible for its behavior.This idea also ﬁts with the fact that the material returns more quickly to itsoriginal shape when it’s warmed up than when it’s cold—the heat increases themobility (decreases the viscosity) of the smaller molecules.

Although we have been discussing how Hooke’s law breaks down, the remark-able thing is perhaps not that Hooke’s law breaks down for large strains but thatit should be so generally true. We can get some idea of why this might be bylooking at the strain energy in a material. To say that the stress is proportionalto the strain is the same thing as saying that the strain energy varies as thesquare of the strain. Suppose we have a rod and we twist it through a smallangle θ. If Hooke’s law holds, the strain energy should be proportional to thesquare of θ. Suppose we were to assume that the energy were some arbitraryfunction of the angle; we could write it as a Taylor expansion about zero angle

U(θ) = U(0) + U0(0)θ + 1

2 U00(0)θ2 + 1

6 U000(0)θ3 + ···

(39.40)

The torque τ is the derivative of U with respect to angle; we would have

2 U000(0)θ2 + ···

τ(θ) = U0(0) + U00(0)θ + 1

(39.41)Now if we measure our angles from the equilibrium position, the ﬁrst term is zero.So the ﬁrst remaining term is proportional to θ; and for small enough angles,it will dominate the term in θ2. [Actually, materials are suﬃciently symmetricinternally so that τ(θ) = −τ(−θ); the term in θ2 will be zero, and the departuresfrom linearity would come only from the θ3 term. There is, however, no reasonwhy this should be true for compressions and tensions.] The thing we have notexplained is why materials usually break soon after the higher-order terms becomesigniﬁcant.

39-5 Calculating the elastic constantsAs our last topic on elasticity we would like to show how one could try tocalculate the elastic constants of a material, starting with some knowledge ofthe properties of the atoms which make up the material. We will take only thesimple case of an ionic cubic crystal like sodium chloride. When a crystal isstrained, its volume or its shape is changed. Such changes result in an increasein the potential energy of the crystal. To calculate the change in strain energy,we have to know where each atom goes. In complicated crystals, the atoms willrearrange themselves in the lattice in very complicated ways to make the totalenergy as small as possible. This makes the computation of the strain energyrather diﬃcult. In the case of a simple cubic crystal, however, it is easy to seewhat will happen. The distortions inside the crystal will be geometrically similarto the distortions of the outside boundaries of the crystal.

We can calculate the elastic constants for a cubic crystal in the following way.First, we assume some force law between each pair of atoms in the crystal. Then,we calculate the change in the internal energy of the crystal when it is distortedfrom its equilibrium shape. This gives us a relation between the energy and thestrains which is quadratic in all the strains. Comparing the energy obtained thisway with Eq. (39.13), we can identify the coeﬃcient of each term with the elasticconstants Cijkl.For our example we will assume a simple force law: that the force betweenneighboring atoms is a central force, by which we mean that it acts along theline between the two atoms. We would expect the forces in ionic crystals to belike this, since they are just primarily Coulomb forces. (The forces of covalentbonds are usually more complicated, since they can exert a sideways push on a39-10

nearby atom; we will leave out this complication.) We are also going to includeonly the forces between each atom and its nearest and next-nearest neighbors.In other words, we will make an approximation which neglects all forces beyondthe next-nearest neighbor. The forces we will include are shown for the xy-planein Fig. 39-10(a). The corresponding forces in the yz- and zx-planes also have tobe included.Since we are only interested in the elastic coeﬃcients which apply to smallstrains, and therefore only want the terms in the energy which vary quadraticallywith the strains, we can imagine that the force between each atom pair varieslinearly with the displacements. We can then imagine that each pair of atoms isjoined by a linear spring, as drawn in Fig. 39-10(b). All of the springs between asodium atom and a chlorine atom should have the same spring constant, say k1.The springs between two sodiums and between two chlorines could have diﬀerentconstants, but we will make our discussion simpler by taking them equal; we callthem k2. (We could come back later and make them diﬀerent after we have seenhow the calculations go.)Now we assume that the crystal is distorted by a homogeneous strain describedby the strain tensor eij. In general, it will have components involving x, y, and z;but we will consider now only a strain with the three components exx, exy,and eyy so that it will be easy to visualize. If we pick one atom as our origin, thedisplacement of every other atom is given by equations like Eq. (39.9):

ux = exxx + exyy,uy = exyx + eyyy.

(39.42)

Suppose we call the atom at x = y = 0「atom 1」and number its neighbors inthe xy-plane as shown in Fig. 39-11. Calling the lattice constant a, we get the xand y displacements ux and uy listed in Table 39-1.Now we can calculate the energy stored in the springs, which is k/2 times thesquare of the extension for each spring. For example, the energy in the horizontalspring between atom 1 and atom 2 is

k1(exxa)2

Note that to ﬁrst order, the y-displacement of atom 2 does not change the lengthof the spring between atom 1 and atom 2. To get the strain energy in a diagonalspring, such as that to atom 3, however, we need to calculate the change in length

due to both the horizontal and vertical displacements. For small displacementsfrom the original cube, we can write the change in the distance to atom 3 as thesum of the components of ux and uy in the diagonal direction, namely as

1√2

(ux + uy).

Using the values of ux and uy from the table, we get the energy

(39.45)

To get the total energy of all the springs connected to atom 1, we must makeone addition to the energy in Eq. (39.45). Even though we have only x- and y-components of the strain, there are still some energies associated with the next-nearest neighbors oﬀ the xy-plane. This additional energy is

k2(e2

xxa2 + e2

yya2).

(39.46)

The elastic constants are related to the energy density w by Eq. (39.13). Theenergy we have calculated is the energy associated with one atom, or rather, it istwice the energy per atom, since one-half of the energy of each spring should beassigned to each of the two atoms it joins. Since there are 1/a3 atoms per unitvolume, w and U0 are related by

w = U02a3 .

To ﬁnd the elastic constants Cijkl, we need only to expand out the squares inEq. (39.45)—adding the terms of (39.46)—and compare the coeﬃcients of eijeklwith the corresponding coeﬃcient in Eq. (39.13). For example, collecting theterms in e2

, we get the factor

and in e2

so

Cxxxx = Cyyyy = k1 + 2k2

.

For the remaining terms, there is a slight complication. Since we cannot dis-tinguish the product of two terms like exxeyy, from eyyexx, the coeﬃcient ofsuch terms in our energy is equal to the sum of two terms in Eq. (39.13). Thecoeﬃcient of exxeyy in Eq. (39.45) is 2k2, so we have that

(Cxxyy + Cyyxx) = 2k2

a

.

But because of the symmetry in our crystal, Cxxyy = Cyyxx, so we have that

By a similar process, we can also get

Cxxyy = Cyyxx = k2a

.

Cxyxy = Cyxyx = k2a

.

Finally, you will notice that any term which involves either x or y only onceis zero—as we concluded earlier from symmetry arguments. Summarizing ourresults:

Cxxxx = Cyyyy = k1 + 2k2Cxyxy = Cyxyx = k2aCxxyy = Cyyxx = Cxyyx = Cyxxy = k2aCxxxy = Cxyyy = etc. = 0.

We have been able to relate the bulk elastic constants to the atomic propertieswhich appear in the constants k1 and k2. In our particular case, Cxyxy = Cxxyy.It turns out—as you can perhaps see from the way the calculations went—thatthese terms are always equal for a cubic crystal, no matter how many force termsare taken into account, provided only that the forces act along the line joiningeach pair of atoms—that is, so long as the forces between atoms are like springsand don’t have a sideways part such as you might get from a cantilevered beam(and you do get in covalent bonds).

We can check this conclusion with the experimental measurements of theelastic constants. In Table 39-2 we give the observed values of the three elasticcoeﬃcients for several cubic crystals.* You will notice that Cxxyy and Cxyxy are,in general, not equal. The reason is that in metals like sodium and potassium theinteratomic forces are not along the line joining the atoms, as we assumed in ourmodel. Diamond does not obey the law either, because the forces in diamond arecovalent forces and have some directional properties—the bonds would prefer to beat the tetrahedral angle. The ionic crystals like lithium ﬂuoride, sodium chloride,and so on, do have nearly all the physical properties assumed in our model, andthe table shows that the constants Cxxyy and Cxyxy are almost equal. It is notclear why silver chloride should not satisfy the condition that Cxxyy = Cxyxy.

* In the literature you will often ﬁnd that a diﬀerent notation is used. For instance, people

usually write Cxxxx = C11, Cxxyy = C12, and Cxyxy = C44.
