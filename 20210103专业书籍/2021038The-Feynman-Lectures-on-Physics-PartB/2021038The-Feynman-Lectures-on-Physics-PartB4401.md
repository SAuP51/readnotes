29-1 Motion in a uniform electric or magnetic ﬁeldWe

want now to describe—mainly in a qualitative way—the motions of chargesin various circumstances. Most of the interesting phenomena in which charges aremoving in ﬁelds occur in very complicated situations, with many, many chargesall interacting with each other. For instance, when an electromagnetic wavegoes through a block of material or a plasma, billions and billions of charges areinteracting with the wave and with each other. We will come to such problemslater, but now we just want to discuss the much simpler problem of the motions ofa single charge in a given ﬁeld. We can then disregard all other charges—except,of course, those charges and currents which exist somewhere to produce the ﬁeldswe will assume.

We should probably ask ﬁrst about the motion of a particle in a uniformelectric ﬁeld. At low velocities, the motion is not particularly interesting—it is justa uniform acceleration in the direction of the ﬁeld. However, if the particle picksup enough energy to become relativistic, then the motion gets more complicated.But we will leave the solution for that case for you to play with.

Next, we consider the motion in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld with zero electricﬁeld. We have already solved this problem—one solution is that the particle goesin a circle. The magnetic force qv × B is always at right angles to the motion,so dp/dt is perpendicular to p and has the magnitude vp/R, where R is theradius of the circle:

The radius of the circular orbit is then

F = qvB = vpR

.

R = pqB

.

(29.1)

That is only one possibility. If the particle has a component of its motionalong the ﬁeld direction, that motion is constant, since there can be no componentof the magnetic force in the direction of the ﬁeld. The general motion of a particlein a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is a constant velocity parallel to B and a circularmotion at right angles to B—the trajectory is a cylindrical helix (Fig. 29-1). Theradius of the helix is given by Eq. (29.1) if we replace p by p⊥, the component ofmomentum at right angles to the ﬁeld.

29-2 Momentum analysisA uniform magnetic ﬁeld is often used in making a「momentum analyzer,」or「momentum spectrometer,」for high-energy charged particles. Suppose thatcharged particles are shot into a uniform magnetic ﬁeld at the point A inFig. 29-2(a), the magnetic ﬁeld being perpendicular to the plane of the drawing.Each particle will go into an orbit which is a circle whose radius is proportionalto its momentum. If all the particles enter perpendicular to the edge of the ﬁeld,they will leave the ﬁeld at a distance x (from A) which is proportional to theirmomentum p. A counter placed at some point such as C will detect only thoseparticles whose momentum is in an interval ∆p near the momentum p = qBx/2.It is, of course, not necessary that the particles go through 180◦ before theyare counted, but the so-called「180◦ spectrometer」has a special property. It is not29-1

necessary that all the particles enter at right angles to the ﬁeld edge. Figure 29-2(b)shows the trajectories of three particles, all with the same momentum but enteringthe ﬁeld at diﬀerent angles. You see that they take diﬀerent trajectories, butall leave the ﬁeld very close to the point C. We say that there is a「focus.」Such a focusing property has the advantage that larger angles can be acceptedat A—although some limit is usually imposed, as shown in the ﬁgure. A largerangular acceptance usually means that more particles are counted in a giventime, decreasing the time required for a given measurement.

By varying the magnetic ﬁeld, or moving the counter along in x, or by usingmany counters to cover a range of x, the「spectrum」of momenta in the incoming[By the「momentum spectrum」f(p), we mean thatbeam can be measured.the number of particles with momenta between p and (p + dp) is f(p) dp.] Suchmeasurements have been made, for example, to determine the distribution ofenergies in the β-decay of various nuclei.There are many other forms of momentum spectrometers, but we will describejust one more, which has an especially large solid angle of acceptance. It is basedon the helical orbits in a uniform ﬁeld, like the one shown in Fig. 29-1. Let’sthink of a cylindrical coordinate system—ρ, θ, z—set up with the z-axis alongthe direction of the ﬁeld. If a particle is emitted from the origin at some angle αwith respect to the z-axis, it will move along a spiral whose equation is

ρ = a sin kz,

θ = bz,

where a, b, and k are parameters you can easily work out in terms of p, α, andthe magnetic ﬁeld B. If we plot the distance ρ from the axis as a function of zfor a given momentum, but for several starting angles, we will get curves like thesolid ones drawn in Fig. 29-3. (Remember that this is just a kind of projection ofa helical trajectory.) When the angle between the axis and the starting directionis larger, the peak value of ρ is large but the longitudinal velocity is less, so thetrajectories for diﬀerent angles tend to come to a kind of「focus」near the point Ain the ﬁgure. If we put a narrow aperture of A, particles with a range of initialangles can still get through and pass on to the axis, where they can be countedby the long detector D.Particles which leave the source at the origin with a higher momentum butat the same angles, follow the paths shown by the broken lines and do not getthrough the aperture at A. So the apparatus selects a small interval of momenta.The advantage over the ﬁrst spectrometer described is that the aperture A—andthe aperture A0—can be an annulus, so that particles which leave the source in arather large solid angle are accepted. A large fraction of the particles from thesource are used—an important advantage for weak sources or for very precisemeasurements.

One pays a price for this advantage, however, because a large volume ofuniform magnetic ﬁeld is required, and this is usually only practical for low-energy particles. One way of making a uniform ﬁeld, you remember, is to wind acoil on a sphere, with a surface current density proportional to the sine of theangle. You can also show that the same thing is true for an ellipsoid of rotation.So such spectrometers are often made by winding an elliptical coil on a wooden(or aluminum) frame. All that is required is that the current in each interval ofaxial distance ∆x be the same, as shown in Fig. 29-4.

29-3 An electrostatic lensParticle focusing has many applications. For instance, the electrons that leavethe cathode in a TV picture tube are brought to a focus at the screen—to makea ﬁne spot. In this case, one wants to take electrons all of the same energy butwith diﬀerent initial angles and bring them together in a small spot. The problemis like focusing light with a lens, and devices which do the corresponding job forparticles are also called lenses.

One example of an electron lens is sketched in Fig. 29-5. It is an「electrostatic」lens whose operation depends on the electric ﬁeld between two adjacent electrodes.29-2

Fig. 29-4. An ellipsoidal coil with equalcurrents in each axial interval ∆x producesa uniform magnetic ﬁeld inside.

Fig. 29-5. An electronic lens. The ﬁeld lines shown are「lines of force,」

that is, of qE.

Its operation can be understood by considering what happens to a parallel beamthat enters from the left. When the electrons arrive at the region a, they feela force with a sidewise component and get a certain impulse that bends themtoward the axis. You might think that they would get an equal and oppositeimpulse in the region b, but that is not so. By the time the electrons reach bthey have gained energy and so spend less time in the region b. The forces arethe same, but the time is shorter, so the impulse is less. In going through theregions a and b, there is a net axial impulse, and the electrons are bent towarda common point. In leaving the high-voltage region, the particles get anotherkick toward the axis. The force is outward in region c and inward in region d,but the particles stay longer in the latter region, so there is again a net impulse.For distances not too far from the axis, the total impulse through the lens isproportional to the distance from the axis (Can you see why?), and this is justthe condition necessary for lens-type focusing.

You can use the same arguments to show that there is focusing if the potentialof the middle electrode is either positive or negative with respect to the othertwo. Electrostatic lenses of this type are commonly used in cathode-ray tubesand in some electron microscopes.

29-4 A magnetic lensAnother kind of lens—often found in electron microscopes—is the magneticlens sketched schematically in Fig. 29-6. A cylindrically symmetric electromagnethas very sharp circular pole tips which produce a strong, nonuniform ﬁeld in asmall region. Electrons which travel vertically through this region are focused.You can understand the mechanism by looking at the magniﬁed view of thepole-tip region drawn in Fig. 29-7. Consider two electrons a and b that leavethe source S at some angle with respect to the axis. As electron a reaches thebeginning of the ﬁeld, it is deﬂected away from you by the horizontal componentof the ﬁeld. But then it will have a lateral velocity, so that when it passes throughthe strong vertical ﬁeld, it will get an impulse toward the axis. Its lateral motionis taken out by the magnetic force as it leaves the ﬁeld, so the net eﬀect is animpulse toward the axis, plus a「rotation」about the axis. All the forces onparticle b are opposite, so it also is deﬂected toward the axis. In the ﬁgure, thedivergent electrons are brought into parallel paths. The action is like a lens withan object at the focal point. Another similar lens upstream can be used to focusthe electrons back to a single point, making an image of the source S.

29-5 The electron microscopeYou know that electron microscopes can「see」objects too small to be seen byoptical microscopes. We discussed in Chapter 30 of Vol. I the basic limitationsof any optical system due to diﬀraction of the lens opening. If a lens opening29-3

netic lens.

subtends the angle 2θ from a source (see Fig. 29-8), two neighboring spots at thesource cannot be seen as separate if they are closer than about

δ ≈ λsin θ

,

where λ is the wavelength of the light. With the best optical microscope, θapproaches the theoretical limit of 90◦, so δ is about equal to λ, or approximately5000 angstroms.

The same limitation would also apply to an electron microscope, but therethe wavelength is—for 50-kilovolt electrons—about 0.05 angstrom. If one coulduse a lens opening of near 30◦, it would be possible to see objects only 15 of anangstrom apart. Since the atoms in molecules are typically 1 or 2 angstromsapart, we could get photographs of molecules. Biology would be easy; we wouldhave a photograph of the DNA structure. What a tremendous thing that wouldbe! Most of present-day research in molecular biology is an attempt to ﬁgure outthe shapes of complex organic molecules. If we could only see them!

Unfortunately, the best resolving power that has been achieved in an electronmicroscope is more like 20 angstroms. The reason is that no one has yet designeda lens with a large opening. All lenses have「spherical aberration,」which meansthat rays at large angles from the axis have a diﬀerent point of focus than the raysnearer the axis, as shown in Fig. 29-9. By special techniques, optical microscopelenses can be made with a negligible spherical aberration, but no one has yetbeen able to make an electron lens which avoids spherical aberration.

In fact, one can show that any electrostatic or magnetic lens of the types wehave described must have an irreducible amount of spherical aberration. Thisaberration—together with diﬀraction—limits the resolving power of electronmicroscopes to their present value.

The limitation we have mentioned does not apply to electric and magneticﬁelds which are not axially symmetric or which are not constant in time. Perhapssome day someone will think of a new kind of electron lens that will overcomethe inherent aberration of the simple electron lens. Then we will be able tophotograph atoms directly. Perhaps one day chemical compounds will be analyzedby looking at the positions of the atoms rather than by looking at the color ofsome precipitate!

29-6 Accelerator guide ﬁeldsMagnetic ﬁelds are also used to produce special particle trajectories in highenergy particle accelerators. Machines like the cyclotron and synchrotron bringparticles to high energies by passing the particles repeatedly through a strongelectric ﬁeld. The particles are held in their cyclic orbits by a magnetic ﬁeld.

We have seen that a particle in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld will go in a circularorbit. This, however, is true only for a perfectly uniform ﬁeld. Imagine a ﬁeld Bwhich is nearly uniform over a large area but which is slightly stronger in oneregion than in another. If we put a particle of momentum p in this ﬁeld, it will goin a nearly circular orbit with the radius R = p/qB. The radius of curvature will,however, be slightly smaller in the region where the ﬁeld is stronger. The orbit isnot a closed circle but will「walk」through the ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 29-10. Wecan, if we wish, consider that the slight「error」in the ﬁeld produces an extraangular kick which sends the particle oﬀ on a new track. If the particles are tomake millions of revolutions in an accelerator, some kind of「radial focusing」isneeded which will tend to keep the trajectories close to some design orbit.

Another diﬃculty with a uniform ﬁeld is that the particles do not remain ina plane. If they start out with the slightest angle—or are given a slight angle byany small error in the ﬁeld—they will go in a helical path that will eventuallytake them into the magnet pole or the ceiling or ﬂoor of the vacuum tank. Somearrangement must be made to inhibit such vertical drifts; the ﬁeld must provide「vertical focusing」as well as radial focusing.

Fig. 29-13. Radial motion of a particle ina magnetic ﬁeld with a large negative slope.

One would, at ﬁrst, guess that radial focusing could be provided by making amagnetic ﬁeld which increases with increasing distance from the center of thedesign path. Then if a particle goes out to a large radius, it will be in a strongerﬁeld which will bend it back toward the correct radius. If it goes to too small aradius, the bending will be less, and it will be returned toward the design radius.If a particle is once started at some angle with respect to the ideal circle, itwill oscillate about the ideal circular orbit, as shown in Fig. 29-11. The radialfocusing would keep the particles near the circular path.

Actually there is still some radial focusing even with the opposite ﬁeld slope.This can happen if the radius of curvature of the trajectory does not increasemore rapidly than the increase in the distance of the particle from the center ofthe ﬁeld. The particle orbits will be as drawn in Fig. 29-12. If the gradient ofthe ﬁeld is too large, however, the orbits will not return to the design radius butwill spiral inward or outward, as shown in Fig. 29-13.

We usually describe the slope of the ﬁeld in terms of the「relative gradient」

or ﬁeld index, n:

n = dB/Bdr/r

.

(29.2)

A guide ﬁeld gives radial focusing if this relative gradient is greater than −1.A radial ﬁeld gradient will also produce vertical forces on the particles.Suppose we have a ﬁeld that is stronger nearer to the center of the orbit andweaker at the outside. A vertical cross section of the magnet at right angles tothe orbit might be as shown in Fig. 29-14. (For protons the orbits would becoming out of the page.) If the ﬁeld is to be stronger to the left and weaker tothe right, the lines of the magnetic ﬁeld must be curved as shown. We can seethat this must be so by using the law that the circulation of B is zero in freespace. If we take coordinates as shown in the ﬁgure, then

or

(∇ × B)y = ∂Bx∂z

− ∂Bz∂x

= 0,

∂Bx∂z

= ∂Bz∂x

.

(29.3)

Since we assume that ∂Bz/∂x is negative, there must be an equal negative ∂Bx/∂z.If the「nominal」plane of the orbit is a plane of symmetry where Bx = 0, thenthe radial component Bx will be negative above the plane and positive below.The lines must be curved as shown.

29-5

Fig. 29-14. A vertical guide ﬁeld as seenin a cross section perpendicular to the orbits.

Such a ﬁeld will have vertical focusing properties. Imagine a proton that istravelling more or less parallel to the central orbit but above it. The horizontalcomponent of B will exert a downward force on it. If the proton is below thecentral orbit, the force is reversed. So there is an eﬀective「restoring force」towardthe central orbit. From our arguments there will be vertical focusing, providedthat the vertical ﬁeld decreases with increasing radius; but if the ﬁeld gradientis positive, there will be「vertical defocusing.」So for vertical focusing, the ﬁeldindex n must be less than zero. We found above that for radial focusing n hadto be greater than −1. The two conditions together give the condition that

−1 < n < 0

if the particles are to be kept in stable orbits. In cyclotrons, values very near zeroare used; in betatrons and synchrotrons, the value n = −0.6 is typically used.

29-7 Alternating-gradient focusingSuch small values of n give rather「weak」focusing. It is clear that much moreeﬀective radial focusing would be given by a large positive gradient (n (cid:29) 1), butthen the vertical forces would be strongly defocusing. Similarly, large negativeslopes (n (cid:28) −1) would give stronger vertical forces but would cause radialdefocusing.It was realized about 10 years ago, however, that a force thatalternates between strong focusing and strong defocusing can still have a netfocusing force.To explain how alternating-gradient focusing works, we will ﬁrst describe theoperation of a quadrupole lens, which is based on the same principle. Imaginethat a uniform negative magnetic ﬁeld is added to the ﬁeld of Fig. 29-14, withthe strength adjusted to make zero ﬁeld at the orbit. The resulting ﬁeld—forsmall displacements from the neutral point—would be like the ﬁeld shown inFig. 29-15. Such a four-pole magnet is called a「quadrupole lens.」A positiveparticle that enters (from the reader) to the right or left of the center is pushedback toward the center. If the particle enters above or below, it is pushed awayfrom the center. This is a horizontal focusing lens. If the horizontal gradientis reversed—as can be done by reversing all the polarities—the signs of all theforces are reversed and we have a vertical focusing lens, as in Fig. 29-16. For suchlenses, the ﬁeld strength—and therefore the focusing forces—increase linearlywith the distance of the lens from the axis.

Now imagine that two such lenses are placed in series. If a particle enterswith some horizontal displacement from the axis, as shown in Fig. 29-17(a), it

will be deﬂected toward the axis in the ﬁrst lens. When it arrives at the secondlens it is closer to the axis, so the force outward is less and the outward deﬂectionis less. There is a net bending toward the axis; the average eﬀect is horizontallyfocusing. On the other hand, if we look at a particle which enters oﬀ the axis inthe vertical direction, the path will be as shown in Fig. 29-17(b). The particle isﬁrst deﬂected away from the axis, but then it arrives at the second lens with alarger displacement, feels a stronger force, and so is bent toward the axis. Againthe net eﬀect is focusing. Thus a pair of quadrupole lenses acts independentlyfor horizontal and vertical motion—very much like an optical lens. Quadrupolelenses are used to form and control beams of particles in much the same waythat optical lenses are used for light beams.

We should point out that an alternating-gradient system does not alwaysproduce focusing.If the gradients are too large (in relation to the particlemomentum or to the spacing between the lenses), the net eﬀect can be a defocusingone. You can see how that could happen if you imagine that the spacing betweenthe two lenses of Fig. 29-17 were increased, say, by a factor of three or four.

Let’s return now to the synchrotron guide magnet. We can consider that itconsists of an alternating sequence of「positive」and「negative」lenses with asuperimposed uniform ﬁeld. The uniform ﬁeld serves to bend the particles, onthe average, in a horizontal circle (with no eﬀect on the vertical motion), andthe alternating lenses act on any particles that might tend to go astray—pushingthem always toward the central orbit (on the average).

There is a nice mechanical analog which demonstrates that a force whichalternates between a「focusing」force and a「defocusing」force can have a net「focusing」eﬀect. Imagine a mechanical「pendulum」which consists of a solidrod with a weight on the end, suspended from a pivot which is arranged to bemoved rapidly up and down by a motor driven crank. Such a pendulum hastwo equilibrium positions. Besides the normal, downward-hanging position, thependulum is also in equilibrium「hanging upward」—with its「bob」above thepivot! Such a pendulum is drawn in Fig. 29-18.

By the following argument you can see that the vertical pivot motion isequivalent to an alternating focusing force. When the pivot is accelerateddownward, the「bob」tends to move inward, as indicated in Fig. 29-19. Whenthe pivot is accelerated upward, the eﬀect is reversed. The force restoring the「bob」toward the axis alternates, but the average eﬀect is a force toward the axis.So the pendulum will swing back and forth about a neutral position which is justopposite the normal one.

There is, of course, a much easier way of keeping a pendulum upside down,and that is by balancing it on your ﬁnger! But try to balance two independentsticks on the same ﬁnger! Or one stick with your eyes closed! Balancing involvesmaking a correction for what is going wrong. And this is not possible, in general,if there are several things going wrong at once. In a synchrotron there are billionsof particles going around together, each one of which may start out with a diﬀerent「error.」The kind of focusing we have been describing works on them all.

29-8 Motion in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁeldsSo far we have talked about particles in electric ﬁelds only or in magneticﬁelds only. There are some interesting eﬀects when there are both kinds ofﬁelds at the same time. Suppose we have a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B and anelectric ﬁeld E at right angles. Particles that start out perpendicular to B willmove in a curve like the one in Fig. 29-20. (The ﬁgure is a plane curve, not ahelix!) We can understand this motion qualitatively. When the particle (assumedpositive) moves in the direction of E, it picks up speed, and so it is bent lessby the magnetic ﬁeld. When it is going against the E-ﬁeld, it loses speed andis continually bent more by the magnetic ﬁeld. The net eﬀect is that it has anaverage「drift」in the direction of E × B.We can, in fact, show that the motion is a uniform circular motion super-imposed on a uniform sidewise motion at the speed vd = E/B—the trajectoryin Fig. 29-20 is a cycloid. Imagine an observer who is moving to the right ata constant speed. In his frame our magnetic ﬁeld gets transformed to a newmagnetic ﬁeld plus an electric ﬁeld in the downward direction. If he has just theright speed, his total electric ﬁeld will be zero, and he will see the electron goingin a circle. So the motion we see is a circular motion, plus a translation at thedrift speed vd = E/B. The motion of electrons in crossed electric and magneticﬁelds is the basis of the magnetron tubes, i.e., oscillators used for generatingmicrowave energy.There are many other interesting examples of particle motions in electric andmagnetic ﬁelds—such as the orbits of the electrons and protons trapped in theVan Allen belts—but we do not, unfortunately, have the time to deal with themhere.
