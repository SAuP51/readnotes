# 0101. Structure Determines Properties

An emerging field of study called「Big History」is nothing if not ambitious. It could also be called「The History of Everything」and covers the period from when the universe was formed in a「Big Bang」13 billion years ago until the present. During the first few seconds of time, protons and electrons combined to give hydrogen and helium atoms. Then, some 4.7 billion years ago, local gravitational forces caused the region of the universe around a particular star to assume that unique feature we call our solar system. Earth was located at the proper distance from the sun to allow the spontaneous formation of molecules, assemblies of molecules, replication of molecular assemblies, and so on. The earliest living things appeared about 4 billion years ago, the earliest ape-like animals 10 million years ago, and modern humans less than 100,000 years ago.

A Neanderthal looking at the lights in the night sky, for example, is not science. But it can lead to science — an organized body of knowledge based on theory and experiment. Astronomy is regarded as the oldest science but was limited to studying the night sky until the telescope was invented in 1608 and pointed skyward by Galileo a year later. Chemists, however, like to call their own discipline「The Central Science」because of its relationship to physics on one side and biology on the other. In the same way, among the various subdisciplines of chemistry, organic chemistry can be said to be central. It adapts the physical principles that underlie the content of general chemistry courses to the relationships between structure and properties of compounds based on carbon — the most versatile of all the elements.

This chapter begins your training toward understanding the relationship between structure and properties by reviewing the fundamentals of the Lewis approach to molecular structure and bonding and describes the various graphical ways molecular structures are presented. Principles of acid–base chemistry — emphasized in a quantitative way in introductory chemistry courses — are revisited qualitatively as a tool for introducing the effect of structure on properties. This structure/property relationship is what makes organic chemistry important. The same atom (carbon) is common to many structural types, countless compounds with different properties, and much variation in the degree to which a particular property is expressed. What is equally remarkable is the degree to which a relatively small group of principles suffice to connect the structure of a substance to its properties.

## 1.1 Atoms, Electrons, and Orbitals

Before discussing structure and bonding in molecules, let’s first review some fundamentals of atomic structure. Each element is characterized by a unique atomic number Z,`*` which is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus. A neutral atom has equal numbers of protons, which are positively charged, and electrons, which are negatively charged.

Electrons were believed to be particles from the time of their discovery in 1897 until 1924, when the French physicist Louis de Broglie suggested that they have wavelike properties as well. Two years later Erwin Schrödinger took the next step and calculated the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom by using equations that treated the electron as if it were a wave. Instead of a single energy, Schrödinger obtained a series of energies, each of which corresponded to a different mathematical description of the electron wave. These mathematical descriptions are called wave functions and are symbolized by the Greek letter ψ (psi).

According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we can’t tell exactly where an electron is, but we can tell where it is most likely to be. The

probability of finding an electron at a particular spot relative to an atom’s nucleus is given by the square of the wave function (ψ 2 ) at that point. Figure 1.1 illustrates the probability of finding an electron at various points in the lowest energy (most stable) state of a hydrogen atom. The darker the color in a region, the higher the probability. The probability of finding an electron at a particular point is greatest near the nucleus and decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus but never becomes zero.

Figure 1.1 Probability distribution (ψ 2 ) for an electron in a 1s orbital.

Wave functions are also called orbitals. For convenience, chemists use the term「orbital」in several different ways. A drawing such as Figure 1.1 is often said to represent an orbital. We will see other kinds of drawings in this chapter, and use the word「orbital」to describe them too.

Orbitals are described by specifying their size, shape, and directional properties. Spherically symmetrical ones such as shown in Figure 1.1 are called s orbitals. The letter s is preceded by the principal quantum number n (n = 1, 2, 3, etc.), which specifies the shell and is related to the energy of the orbital. An electron in a 1s orbital is likely to be found closer to the nucleus, is lower in energy, and is more strongly held than an electron in a 2s orbital.

Instead of probability distributions, it is more common to represent orbitals by their boundary surfaces, as shown in Figure 1.2 for the 1s and 2s orbitals. The region enclosed by a boundary surface is arbitrary but is customarily the volume where the probability of finding an electron is high — on the order of 90–95%. Like the probability distribution plot from which it is derived, a picture of a boundary surface is usually described as a drawing of an orbital.

Figure 1.2 Boundary surfaces of a 1s orbital and a 2s orbital.

A hydrogen atom (Z = 1) has one electron; a helium atom (Z = 2) has two. The single electron of hydrogen occupies a 1s orbital, as do the two electrons of helium. We write their electron configurations as

1

Hydrogen: 1s

Helium: 1s 2

In addition to being negatively charged, electrons possess the property of spin. The spin quantum number of an electron can have a value of either + I or - I . According to the Pauli ------- exclusion principle, two electrons may occupy the same orbital only when they have opposite, or「paired,」spins. For 2 2 --- this reason, no orbital can contain more than two electrons. Because two electrons fill the 1s orbital, the third electron in lithium (Z = 3) must occupy an orbital of higher energy. After 1s, the next higher energy orbital is 2s. The third electron in lithium therefore occupies the 2s orbital, and the electron configuration of lithium is

Lithium: 1s 2 2s

A complete periodic table of the elements is presented at the back of the book.

The period (or row) of the periodic table in which an element appears corresponds to the principal quantum number of the highest numbered occupied orbital (n = 1 in the case of hydrogen and helium). Hydrogen and helium are first-row elements; lithium (n = 2) is a second-row element.

With beryllium (Z = 4), the 2s level becomes filled and, beginning with boron (Z = 5), the next orbitals to be occupied are 2p x , 2p y , and 2p z . These

three orbitals (Figure 1.3) are of equal energy and are characterized by boundary surfaces that are usually described as「dumbbell-shaped.」The axes of the three 2p orbitals are at right angles to one another. Each orbital consists of two「lobes,」represented in Figure 1.3 by regions of different colors. Regions of a single orbital, in this case, each 2p orbital, may be separated by nodal surfaces where the wave function changes sign and the probability of finding an electron is zero.

Other methods are also used to contrast the regions of an orbital where the signs of the wave function are different. Some mark one lobe of a p orbital + and the other −. Others shade one lobe and leave the other blank. When this level of detail isn’t necessary, no differentiation is made between the two lobes.

Boundary surfaces of the 2p orbitals. The wave function changes sign at the nucleus. The two halves of each orbital are indicated by different colors. The yz-plane is a nodal surface for the 2px orbital. The probability of finding a 2Px electron in the yz-plane is zero. Analogously, the xzplane is a nodal surface for the 2Py orbital, and the xy-plane is a nodal surface for the 2p 2 orbital.

Organic Chemistry: The Early Days

E

ighteenth-century chemists regarded their science as being composed of two branches. One dealt with substances obtained from natural or living sources and was called organic chemistry, the other dealt with materials from nonliving matter-minerals and the like-and was called inorganic chemistry. Over time, combustion analysis established that the compounds derived from natural sources contained carbon, and a new definition of organic chemistry emerged: Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. This is the definition we still use today.

As the eighteenth century gave way to the nineteenth, many scientists still subscribed to a doctrine known as vita/ism, which held that living systems possessed a "vital force" that was absent in nonliving systems. Substances derived from natural sources (organic) were thought to be fundamentally different from inorganic ones. It was believed that inorganic compounds could be synthesized in the laboratory, but organic compounds could not-at least not from inorganic materials.

In 1823, Friedrich Wohler, after completing medical studies in Germany, spent a year in Stockholm studying under one of the world's foremost chemists of the time, Jons Jacob Berzelius. Wohler subsequently went on to have a distinguished independent career, spending most of it at the University of Gottingen. He is best remembered for a brief paper he published in 1828 in which he noted that, on evaporating an aqueous solution of ammonium cyanate, he obtained "colorless, clear crystals often more than an inch long," which were not ammonium cyanate but were instead urea.

This transformation was remarkable at the time because an inorganic salt, ammonium cyanate, was converted to urea, a known organic substance earlier isolated from urine. It is now recognized as a significant early step toward overturning the philosophy of vitalism. Although Wohler himself made no extravagant claims concerning the relationship of his discovery to vitalist theory, the die was cast, and over the next generation organic chemistry outgrew vitalism. What particularly seemed to excite Wohler and Berzelius had very little to do with vitalism. Berzelius was interested in cases in which two clearly different materials had the same elemental composition, and he invented the word isomers to apply to them. Wohler's observation that an inorganic compound (ammonium cyanate) of molecular formula CH 4 N 2 O could be transformed into an organic compound (urea) of the same molecular formula had an important bearing on the concept of isomerism.

From the concept of isomerism we can trace the origins of the structural theory-the idea that a specific arrangement of atoms uniquely defines a substance. Ammonium cyanate and urea are different compounds because they have different structures.

Three mid-nineteenth-century scientists, August Kekule, Archibald S. Couper, and Alexander M. Butlerov, stand out for separately proposing the elements of the structural theory. The essential features of Kekule's theory, developed and presented while he taught at Heidelberg in 1858, were that carbon normally formed four bonds and had the capacity to bond to other carbons so as to form long chains. Isomers were possible because the same elemental composition (say, the CH4N2O molecular formula common to both ammonium cyanate and urea) accommodates more than one pattern of atoms and bonds. Shortly thereafter, Couper, a Scot working at the Ecole de Medecine in Paris, and Butlerov, a Russian chemist at the University of Kazan, proposed similar theories.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, major discoveries about atoms and electrons placed theories of molecular structure and bonding on a more secure, physics-based foundation. Several of these are described at the beginning of this section.

The electron configurations of the first 12 elements, hydrogen through magnesiwn, are given in Table 1.1. In filling the 2p orbitals, notice that each is singly occupied before any one is doubly occupied. This general principle for orbitals of equal energy is known as Hund's mle. Of particular importance in Table I I are hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Cotmtless organic compounds contain nitrogen, oxygen, or both in addition to carbon, the essential element of organic chemistry. Most of them also contain hydrogen.

It is often convenient to speak of the valence electrons of an atom. These are the outermost electrons, the ones most likely to be involved in chemical bonding and reactions. For second-row elements these are the 2s and 2p electrons. Because four orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2p 2 ) are involved, the maximum number of electrons in the valence shell of any second-row element is 8. Neon, with all its 2s and 2p orbitals doubly occupied, ---has eight valence electrons and completes the second row of the periodic table. For .ID.lWl=gi:o.11p elements, the number of valence electrons Page 6 is equal to its group number in the periodic table.

Detailed solutions to all of the problems are found in the Student Solutions Manual along with a brief discussion and advice on how to do problems of the same type.

Problem 1.1

How many electrons does carbon have? How many are valence electrons? What third-row element has the same number of valence electrons as carbon?

Once the 2s and 2p orbitals are filled, the next level is the 3s, followed by the 3p x , 3p y , and 3p z orbitals. Electrons in these orbitals are farther from

the nucleus than those in the 2s and 2p orbitals and are of higher energy.

In-chapter problems that contain multiple parts are accompanied by a sample solution to part (a).

Problem 1.2

Referring to the periodic table as needed, write electron configurations for all the elements in the third period.

Sample Solution The third period begins with sodium and ends with argon. The atomic number Z of sodium is 11, and so a sodium atom has 11 electrons. The maximum number of electrons in the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals is ten, and so the eleventh electron of

sodium occupies a 3s orbital. The electron configuration of sodium is 1s 2 2s 2 2p

2 x

2 y

2p

2p z 2

3s 1 .

Neon, in the second period, and argon, in the third, have eight electrons in their valence shell; they are said to have a complete octet of electrons. Helium, neon, and argon belong to the class of elements known as noble gases or rare gases. The noble gases are characterized by an extremely stable「closed-shell」electron configuration and are very unreactive.

Structure determines properties and the properties of atoms depend on atomic structure. All of an element’s protons are in its nucleus, but the element’s electrons are distributed among orbitals of various energy and distance from the nucleus. More than anything else, we look at its electron configuration when we wish to understand how an element behaves. The next section illustrates this with a brief review of ionic bonding.

## 1.2 Ionic Bonds

Page 7

Atoms combine with one another to give compounds having properties different from the atoms they contain. The attractive force between atoms in a compound is a chemical bond. One type of chemical bond, called an ionic bond, is the force of attraction between oppositely charged species (ions) (Figure 1.4). Positively charged ions are referred to as cations; negatively charged ions are anions.

Figure 1.4

An ionic bond is the force of attraction between oppositely charged ions. Each Na + ion in the crystal lattice of solid NaCl is involved in ionic bonding to each of six surrounding Cl − ions and vice versa. The smaller spheres are Na + and the larger spheres are Cl − .

Whether an element is the source of the cation or anion in an ionic bond depends on several factors, for which the periodic table can serve as a guide. In forming ionic compounds, elements at the left of the periodic table typically lose electrons, giving a cation that has the same electron configuration as

the preceding noble gas. Loss of an electron from sodium, for example, yields Na + , which has the same electron configuration as neon.

1, 1 21 1 2p 0 3s1 Problem 1.3

Species that have the same number of electrons are described as isoelectronic. What +2 ion is isoelectronic with Na + ? What −2 ion?

The SI (Système International d’Unités) unit of energy is the joule (J). An older unit is the calorie (cal). Many chemists still express energy changes in units of kilocalories per mole (1 kcal/mol = 4.184 kJ/mol).

A large amount of energy, called the ionization energy, must be transferred to any atom to dislodge an electron. The ionization energy of sodium, for example, is 496 kJ/mol (119 kcal/mol). Processes that absorb energy are said to be endothermic. Compared with other elements, sodium and its relatives in group 1A have relatively low ionization energies. In general, ionization energy increases across a row in the periodic table.

Elements at the right of the periodic table tend to gain electrons to reach the electron configuration of the next higher noble gas. Adding an electron

to chlorine, for example, gives the anion Cl − , which has the same closed-shell electron configuration as the noble gas argon.

Problem 1.4

Which of the following ions possess a noble gas electron configuration?

(a) K +

(b) He +

(c) H −

(d) O −

(e) F −

(f) Ca 2+

Sample Solution (a) Potassium has atomic number 19, and so a potassium atom has 19 electrons. The ion K + , therefore, has 18 electrons, the same as the noble gas argon. The electron configurations of both K + and Ar are 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 .

Energy is released when a chlorine atom captures an electron. Energy-releasing reactions are described as exothermic, and the energy change for an exothermic process has a negative sign. The energy change for addition of an electron to an atom is referred to as its electron affinity and is −349 kJ/mol (−83.4 kcal/mol) for chlorine.

We can use the ionization energy of sodium and the electron affinity of chlorine to calculate the energy change for the reaction:

Were we to simply add the ionization energy of 496 kJ/mol (119 kcal/mol) for sodium and the electron affinity of −349 kJ/mol (−83.4 kcal/mol) for chlorine, we would conclude that the overall process is endothermic by +147 kJ/mol (+35 kcal/mol). The energy liberated by adding an electron to chlorine is insufficient to override the energy required to remove an electron from sodium. This analysis, however, fails to consider the force of

attraction between the oppositely charged ions Na separated gas-phase ions:

This lattice energy is 787 kJ/mol (188 kcal/mol) and is more than sufficient to make the overall process for formation of sodium chloride from the elements exothermic. Forces between charged particles are called electrostatic, or Coulombic, and constitute an ionic bond when they are attractive. Ionic bonding was proposed by the German physicist Walther Kossel in 1916 in order to explain the ability of substances such as molten sodium chloride to conduct an electric current. He was the son of Albrecht Kossel, winner of the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for early studies of nucleic acids.

Problem 1.5

What is the electron configuration of C + ? Of C − ? Does either one of these ions have a noble gas (closed-shell) electron configuration?

Ionic bonds are very common in inorganic compounds, but rare in organic ones. The ionization energy of carbon is too large and the electron affinity

too small for carbon to realistically form a C 4+ or C 4− ion. What kinds of bonds, then, link carbon to other elements in millions of organic compounds? Instead of losing or gaining electrons, carbon shares electrons with other elements (including other carbon atoms) to give what are called covalent bonds.

## 1.3 Covalent Bonds, Lewis Formulas, and the Octet Rule

Gilbert Newton Lewis has been called the greatest American chemist.

The covalent, or shared electron pair, model of chemical bonding was first suggested by G. N. Lewis of the University of California in 1916. Lewis proposed that a sharing of two electrons by two hydrogen atoms permits each one to have a stable closed-shell electron configuration analogous to that of helium.

The amount of energy required to dissociate a hydrogen molecule H 2 to two separate hydrogen atoms is its bond dissociation enthalpy. For H 2 it is

quite large, amounting to +435 kJ/mol (+104 kcal/mol). The main contributor to the strength of the covalent bond in H

2

is the increased Coulombic

force exerted on its two electrons. Each electron in H 2「feels」the attractive force of two nuclei, rather than one as it would in an isolated hydrogen atom.

Only the electrons in an atom’s valence shell are involved in covalent bonding. Fluorine, for example, has nine electrons, but only seven are in its valence shell. Pairing a valence electron of one fluorine atom with one of a second fluorine gives a fluorine molecule (F 2 ) in which each

fluorine has eight valence electrons and an electron configuration equivalent to that of the noble gas neon. Shared electrons count toward satisfying the octet of both atoms.

The six valence electrons of each fluorine that are not involved in bonding comprise three unshared pairs.

Unshared pairs are also called lone pairs.

Page 9

Structural formulas such as those just shown for H 2 and F 2 where electrons are represented as dots are called Lewis formulas, or Lewis structures.

It is usually more convenient to represent shared electron-pair bonds as lines and to sometimes omit electron pairs.

The Lewis model limits second-row elements (Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne) to a total of eight electrons (shared plus unshared) in their valence shells. Hydrogen is limited to two. Most of the elements that we’ll encounter in this text obey the octet rule: In forming compounds they gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration characterized by eight valence electrons. When the octet rule is satisfied for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine, each has an electron configuration analogous to that of the noble gas neon. The Lewis formulas of methane (CH 4 ), ammonia

(NH 3 ), water (H 2 O), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) given in Table 1.2 illustrate the octet rule.

With four valence electrons, carbon normally forms four covalent bonds as shown in Table 1.2 for CH 4 . In addition to C–H bonds, most organic compounds contain covalent C–C bonds. Ethane (C 2 H 6 ) is an example.

Problem 1.6

Page 10

Write Lewis formulas, including unshared pairs, for each of the following. Carbon has four bonds in each compound.

(a) Propane (C 3 H 8 )

(b) Methanol (CH 4 O)

(c) Methyl fluoride (CH 3 F)

(d) Ethyl fluoride (C 2 H 5 F)

Sample Solution (a) The Lewis formula of propane is analogous to that of ethane but the chain has three carbons instead of two.

The ten covalent bonds in the Lewis formula shown account for 20 valence electrons, which is the same as that calculated from the

molecular formula (C 3 H 8 ). The eight hydrogens of C 3 H 8 contribute 1 electron each and the three carbons 4 each, for a total of 20 (8

from the hydrogens and 12 from the carbons). Therefore, all the valence electrons are in covalent bonds; propane has no unshared

pairs.

Lewis’s concept of shared electron-pair bonds allows for four-electron double bonds and six-electron triple bonds. Ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) has 12 valence electrons, which can be distributed as follows:

The structural formula produced has a single bond between the carbons and seven electrons around each. By pairing the unshared electron of one carbon with its counterpart of the other carbon, a double bond results and the octet rule is satisfied for both carbons.

Likewise, the ten valence electrons of acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) can be arranged in a structural formula that satisfies the octet rule when six of them are

shared in a triple bond between the carbons.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has two carbon–oxygen double bonds, thus satisfying the octet rule for both carbon and oxygen.

Problem 1.7

All of the hydrogens are bonded to carbon in both of the following. Write a Lewis formula that satisfies the octet rule for each.

(a) Formaldehyde (CH 2 O)

(b) Hydrogen cyanide (HCN)

Sample Solution (a) Formaldehyde has 12 valence electrons: 4 from carbon, 2 from two hydrogens, and 6 from oxygen. Page 11 Connect carbon to oxygen and both hydrogens by covalent bonds.

Pair the unpaired electron on carbon with the unpaired electron on oxygen to give a carbon–oxygen double bond. The resulting structural formula satisfies the octet rule.

# 1.4 Polar Covalent Bonds, Electronegativity, and Bond Dipoles

Electrons in covalent bonds are not necessarily shared equally by the two atoms that they connect. If one atom has a greater tendency to attract electrons toward itself than the other, the electron distribution is polarized, and the bond is described as polar covalent. The tendency of an atom to attract the electrons in a covalent bond toward itself defines its electronegativity. An electronegative element attracts electrons; an electropositive one donates them.
