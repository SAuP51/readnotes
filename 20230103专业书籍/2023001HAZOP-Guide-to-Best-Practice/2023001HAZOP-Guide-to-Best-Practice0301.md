## 0301. The HAZOP Study Method

### 3.1 Essential Features

A HAZOP study is a structured and systematic examination of a planned or existing process or operation. At the outset of the study, the team creates a conceptual model (design representation) of the system or operation. This uses all available, relevant material such as a firm, detailed design, an outline of operating procedures, material data sheets, and the reports of earlier hazard studies. Hazards and potential operating problems are then sought by considering possible deviations from the design intention of the section or stage under review. The design intention is a word picture of what should be happening and should contain all of the key parameters that will be explored during the study. It should also include a statement of the intended operating range (envelope). This is usually more limiting than the physical design conditions. For those deviations where the team can suggest a cause, the consequences are estimated using the team’s experience and existing safeguards are taken into account. Where the team considers the risk to be nontrivial or where an aspect requires further investigation, a formal record is generated to allow the problem to be followed up outside the meeting. The team then moves on with the analysis.

The validity of the analysis obviously depends upon having the right people in the team, the accuracy of the information used, and the quality of the design. It is normally assumed that the design work has been done in a competent manner so that operations within the design envelope are safe. Even where this is the case, the later stages of the project must also be carried out correctly—that is, engineering standards are followed and there are proper standards of construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance, and management. A good HAZOP study tries to take account of these aspects and of the changes that can reasonably be expected during the lifetime of the operation. A study will sometimes identify problems that are within the design limits as well as problems which develop as the plant ages or are caused by human error.

A key feature of timing of a HAZOP study is that the design must be firm and the P&IDs must be frozen—a situation that requires management commitment and forward planning.

3.1 基本特征

HAZOP（Hazard and Operability Study，危害与可操作性分析）研究是一种结构化且系统化的方法，用于检查计划中或现有的工艺过程或操作。在研究开始时，团队会创建系统或操作的概念模型（conceptual model），即设计表示。这一模型基于所有可用的相关资料，包括确定的详细设计、操作程序大纲、材料数据表以及先前的危害研究报告。

危害和潜在的操作问题是通过考虑可能偏离设计意图的情况来识别的。这里的「设计意图」是指对预期情况的文字描述，它应包含研究过程中将探讨的所有关键参数。此外，设计意图还应包括预期操作范围（又称「操作包络」）的说明。这个操作范围通常比物理设计条件更为严格。

对于团队能够找出原因的偏差，他们会根据经验估计其后果，并考虑现有的安全保障措施（safeguards）。如果团队认为某个风险不可忽视，或某个方面需要进一步调查，他们会生成一份正式记录，以便在会议之外跟进处理这个问题。

完成一个环节的分析后，团队会继续进行下一个环节的分析，直到整个系统或操作都被彻底审查。

HAZOP（危险与可操作性）分析的有效性显然取决于三个关键因素：团队成员的专业能力、所使用信息的准确性以及设计的质量。通常情况下，我们假设设计工作已经由专业人员完成，确保在设计范围内的操作是安全的。但即便如此，项目的后期阶段仍然需要严格把关 —— 这意味着要严格遵循工程标准，并在建设、调试、操作、维护和管理等各个环节都保持高水准。

一个优秀的 HAZOP 研究会考虑到上述所有方面，并且还会预估整个操作周期内可能发生的变化。这种研究有时能发现设计限制内的潜在问题，也能识别出随着设备老化或由于人为错误可能产生的隐患。

进行 HAZOP 研究的一个关键时间点是：设计方案必须已经确定，且工艺流程图（P&ID）必须已经固定下来 —— 这需要管理层的承诺和前瞻性规划。

### 3.2 The Purpose

One purpose of a HAZOP study is to identify and evaluate any remaining hazards within a planned process or operation that were not identified or designed out in earlier stages. The hazards may be several types, including those to people and property, both on- and off-site. It is also important to consider the potential effects to the environment. Regardless of the type of hazard, many have directly related financial consequences.

HAZOP studies are also normally used to identify significant operability or quality problems and this will be included as a defined objective of a study. A survey of EPSC members carried out in 1999 as part of the preparation for the first edition of this Guide found that over 90% of the respondents included significant operability problems in the scope of the search. Operability problems arise through the reliability as well as the manner of the plant operation, with consequences such as downtime, damaged equipment, and the expense of lost, spoilt, or out-of-specification product leading to expensive re-run or disposal costs. The need to consider quality issues varies greatly with the details of the operation but in some industries it is a crucial area. Of course, many operability problems also lead to hazards, giving a dual reason for identifying and controlling them. A HAZOP study may also consider quality issues in the proposed design.

It is advisable to cover aspects of maintenance operations, including isolation, preparation, and removal for maintenance since these often create hazards as well as an operability problem. Where there are manual operations or activities, it may be necessary to analyze the ergonomics of the whole operation or activity in detail.

3.2 目的

HAZOP 研究的一个主要目的是识别和评估在项目早期阶段可能被忽视或未能通过设计消除的潜在危险。这些危险可能涉及多个方面，包括对厂内和厂外人员及财产的威胁。同时，我们也不能忽视对环境可能造成的影响。值得注意的是，无论是哪种类型的危险，往往都会带来直接的经济损失。

危险与可操作性分析（HAZOP）研究通常也用于识别重大的可操作性或质量问题，这是研究的明确目标之一。在编写本指南第一版时，1999 年对欧洲过程安全中心（EPSC）成员进行的一项调查发现，超过 90% 的受访者在研究范围内包括了重大的可操作性问题。可操作性问题源于工厂运行的可靠性和方式，可能导致诸如停机时间、设备损坏等后果，以及因产品损失、变质或不合格而造成的昂贵返工或处置成本。考虑质量问题的必要性因操作细节而异，但在某些行业，这是至关重要的领域。当然，许多可操作性问题也会引发危险，这为识别和控制它们提供了双重理由。HAZOP 研究还可能考虑拟议设计中的质量问题。

建议在研究中涵盖维护操作的各个方面，包括设备隔离、维护准备和拆除，因为这些环节常常会造成危险和可操作性问题。对于涉及人工操作或活动的情况，可能需要详细分析整个操作或活动的人机工程学（ergonomics），以确保操作的安全性和效率。

### 3.3 Limitations

Difficulties may be caused by inadequate terms of reference or poor definition of the study scope. The intention of a HAZOP study is not to become a re-design meeting. Nevertheless, some actions may result in changes to the design and potential problems may be found within the intended range of operation.

The analysis of problems within a HAZOP study is normally qualitative although, increasingly, simple risk assessment is used to help the team to decide on the need for action and the action itself. Some of the problems may need a fuller quantitative analysis, including quantitative risk assessment (QRA). This would be done outside the HAZOP meeting.

A HAZOP study is not an infallible method of identifying every possible hazard or operability problem that could arise during the actual operations. Expertise and experience within the team is crucial to the quality and completeness of a study. The accuracy and extent of the information available to the team, the scope of the study, and the manner of the study all influence its success. Only a systematic, creative, and imaginative examination can yield a high-quality report but even then, not every potential problem will necessarily be found. Additionally, the study will only be effective if the issues identified during the study are resolved and put into practice. Some important factors for success are listed in Chapter 12.

3.3 局限性

HAZOP（危险与可操作性）研究可能会因参考标准不足或研究范围界定不清而遇到困难。需要注意的是，HAZOP 研究的目的并非重新设计流程，而是识别潜在风险。尽管如此，研究结果可能会导致设计变更，同时在预期的操作范围内可能会发现一些潜在问题。

在 HAZOP 研究中，问题分析通常采用定性方法。不过，越来越多的研究开始使用简单的风险评估方法，帮助团队决定是否需要采取行动以及应该采取什么行动。有些问题可能需要更深入的定量分析，包括定量风险评估（QRA）。这些分析通常会在 HAZOP 会议之外进行。

需要明确的是，HAZOP 研究并非万无一失的方法，它无法识别实际操作中可能出现的所有危险或操作问题。研究的质量和完整性很大程度上取决于团队成员的专业知识和经验。此外，可用信息的准确性和范围、研究的范围以及研究的方式都会影响研究的成功。只有通过系统、创造性和富有想象力的检查，才能产生高质量的报告。但即便如此，也可能无法发现所有潜在问题。更重要的是，只有将研究中识别的问题解决并付诸实践，HAZOP 研究才能真正发挥作用。第 12 章列出了一些确保 HAZOP 研究成功的重要因素。
