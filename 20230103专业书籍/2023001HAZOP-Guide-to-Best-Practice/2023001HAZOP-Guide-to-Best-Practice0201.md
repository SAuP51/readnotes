## 0201. Process Hazard Studies

Within the process industries, significant attention has been given to the development of comprehensive safety management systems (SMSs) or SHE management systems with the objective of protecting workers, the public, and the environment. There are also requirements within legislation such as the Seveso II Directive, European Union (EU) Directive 96/82/ EC, 9 and subsequent country-specific legislation, requiring those companies handling hazardous materials to have in place an adequate SMS and to fulfill specified obligations. These requirements range from the preparation of Major Accident Prevention Policies to submission of detailed safety reports to a competent authority. Other non-EU countries have similar legislation—for example, the Office of Safety and Health Administration (USA) (OSHA) regulation 29CFR, Part 1910.119 (1992), Process Safety Management (PSM) 10 in the USA. An integral element of such systems is the use of systematic techniques for the identification of hazards. In addition to meeting legal requirements, there are considerable business benefits to be gained from the use of a systematic and thorough approach to hazard identification. These benefits include improvement of quality, faster start-up, and a reduction of subsequent operability problems.

For a new project, the greatest benefit is obtained by carrying out a number of studies throughout the design process. One such sequence is the Hazard Study (HS) methodology developed by ICI which used six stages. 4,11 Each study verifies that the actions of previous studies have been carried out and signed off, and that the hazard and environmental issues have been identified and are being addressed in a timely and detailed manner.

### 2.1 HS 1—CONCEPT STAGE HAZARD REVIEW

In this first study, the basic hazards of the materials and the operation are identified and SHE criteria set. It identifies what information is needed and the program of studies required to ensure that all SHE issues are adequately addressed. The aspects covered may include reaction kinetics, toxicity data, environmental impact, and any special process features that need further evaluation. In addition, any constraints due to relevant legislation are identified. A decision may be taken on which of the remaining hazard studies (two to six) should also be undertaken. It is also important at this early stage to apply the principles of inherent SHE 12,13 within the design. This aims to eliminate, avoid, or reduce potential hazards in the process.

### 2.2 HS 2—HAZID AT FRONT-END ENGINEERING DESIGN (FEED) OR PROJECT DEFINITION STAGE

This study typically covers hazard identification and risk assessment, operability and control features that must be built into the detailed design, and any special environmental features to be covered.

It is important that the safety integrity levels (SILs) 14,15 of any safety instrumented systems (SISs) are addressed during this study as the design will still be flexible and simple design changes may be applied which will reduce the SILs and so simplify the design.

At the end of HS 2, the level of development of design and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) would be “approved for design” (AFD). All the main features should have been added but the finer ones will not. It is helpful to examine the AFD diagrams for the more blatant errors using a form of checklist. An example is given in the final section of this chapter.

### 2.3 HS 3—DETAILED DESIGN HAZARD STUDY

This normally involves a detailed review of a firm design aimed at the identification of hazard and operability problems. Relief and blowdown studies, area classification, personal protection, and manual handling may, if appropriate, be included at this stage. HAZOP studies are normally carried out at this stage.

### 2.4 HS 4—CONSTRUCTION/DESIGN VERIFICATION

This review is performed at the end of the construction stage. The hardware is checked to ensure it has been built as intended and that there are no violations of the designer’s intent. It also confirms that the actions from the detailed design hazard study are incorporated, and operating and emergency procedures are checked.

### 2.5 HS 5—PRE-COMMISSIONING SAFETY REVIEW

This examines the preparedness of the operations group for start-up and typically covers training, the final operating procedures, preparation procedures, and readiness for start-up including function testing, cleanliness, and purging. Confirmation of compliance with company and legislative standards is done at this stage, for example, under the Pre Start-up Safety Review (PSSR) required under the OSHA PSM legislation in the USA.

### 2.6 HS 6—PROJECT CLOSE-OUT/POST START-UP REVIEW

This study, carried out a few months into the production phase, confirms that all outstanding issues from the previous five studies are complete and seeks any lessons that might give useful feedback to future design work.

In addition to these six studies, two more may be included. These are usually referred to as study zero and study seven, to fit with the numbering scheme used above.

### 2.7 HS 0—CONSIDERATION OF INHERENTLY SAFER OR LESS POLLUTING SYSTEMS

Study zero takes place between the Research and Technical Departments before the concept stage. It attempts to identify and to incorporate the inherently safer and greener ideas as early as possible so that they will be part of the final design.

### 2.8 HS 7—DEMOLITION/ABANDONMENT REVIEWS

This study can take place before the final shut down but the objective of the study is to identify those issues which should be dealt with during the demolition process. It should address issues such as cleaning methods and standards, size reduction, recovery and recycle of working inventories, recycle of equipment, safe disposal of nonrecyclable materials/equipment, and location of potentially harmful/toxic materials in the equipment or soil. In addition it should address the integrity of lifting devices/brackets, access routes, and the sequence of removal bearing in mind that some equipment may be supporting other equipment.

### 2.9 OVERVIEW OF HAZARD STUDIES

The relationship of HS 1À6 to the project life cycle is shown in Figure 2.1. Experience shows that the use of HS 1 and 2 ensures key conceptual issues are dealt with early in the life of the project and not left to the HAZOP study. Use of HS 1 and 2 makes the HAZOP study easier and faster.

While HAZOP is one of the most flexible techniques for hazard identification, there are other identification and assessment techniques which can be used at the detailed design stage to supplement HAZOP (Figure 2.2).

Figure 2.2 Possible alternatives to replace or supplement HAZOP study as a detailed design hazard study.

Whenever HAZOP study is the chosen technique, its use should be justified on the basis of complexity, inherent hazards, or the costs of the operation. While HAZOP study is ideally suited to novel processes, hazardous process or complex processes, it can equally be used in simple and repeat designs although there may be fewer benefits. Considerable benefits can also be found from its use for modifications or for change of use of plant.

More information on the techniques used for hazard identification and the way in which these relate to an overall process for risk assessment is given by Pitblado 16 and by Crawley and Tyler.2

{Are piping materials of construction in compliance with codes?}

GPT-4（2023-07-18）

"Are piping materials of construction in compliance with codes?"

工程中的管道材料是否符合规定的标准或编码，通常取决于项目的特定需求和所在地的法规。不过，基于大多数地区和行业的规定，工程项目中的管道材料通常需要遵循一定的标准或编码。这些标准或编码可能涉及管道的制造材料、设计、安装、测试和维护等方面，以确保工程的安全和效率。

例如，美国的ASME B31.3是化工行业中常用的一个标准，它规定了工程中管道系统的许多方面，包括材料的选择、设计、制造和测试等。类似地，英国的BS EN 13480也是一个对管道工程中使用的材料和设计等方面做出规定的标准。

实际案例：在石油和天然气行业中，因为这些行业中的液体和气体通常具有高压和高温的特点，所以管道的选择和设计需要格外小心。例如，北海区的石油和天然气开采项目就会严格按照如NORSOK标准（挪威海洋技术标准）来选择和使用管道材料，以确保项目的安全和稳定运行。这些标准中会详细规定管道的材料、设计、焊接、检测和安装等方面的要求。

化工设计中，liquid capture bunds是什么

GPT-4（2023-07-18）

"Liquid capture bunds" 在化工设计中是一种特殊结构，用于收集可能发生的液体溢出或泄漏，以减少环境污染和安全风险。它们通常被设计成防泄沟或隔墙，围绕着储存或处理有害液体的设施或区域，以便在泄漏时捕获和安全处理这些液体。具体设计的大小和类型可能会根据所处理液体的性质和可能的泄漏量来确定。

"Are liquid capture bunds required anywhere for Safety or Environmental requirements?"

是的，液体捕获隔堤在很多场合因为安全或环境保护的需要而被要求使用。下面是详细解答：

1、安全要求：液体捕获隔堤可以防止有害或危险液体泄漏到工作区域，降低了工作人员接触有害物质的风险，同时避免了潜在的滑倒事故。在处理易燃、易爆或有毒液体的场合，这种防护措施尤其重要。例如，石油精炼厂、化学品生产设施或燃料存储地点通常都需要液体捕获隔堤。

2、环境要求：液体捕获隔堤也用于防止有害液体进入环境，比如地下水、河流或湖泊。这是为了满足环保法规，防止污染，保护生态系统。例如，在很多国家，如美国，根据资源保护和恢复法案（RCRA）和洁净水法（CWA），在储存一定数量的石油或某些危险废物的设施必须设置隔堤。

实际案例：在2010年的墨西哥湾石油泄漏事件中，BP公司在油井泄漏后，建立了系列的隔堤来防止油污进一步扩散。虽然这次事件的隔堤设施是在事故发生后临时建立的，但它展示了隔堤在控制有害液体泄漏方面的重要性。在预防事故和降低其影响方面，提前建立并维护良好的液体捕获隔堤显得尤为重要。
