## 0501. Organizing a HAZOP Study

{The preparation work for a batch or sequential operation is usually more demanding than for a continuous process. In addition to the same range of background material, descriptions are also required of the detailed method of operation, the draft operating procedure, and the outline of the control sequence for a computer-controlled process. This time-dependent information is used in the division of the operation into stages for study, as illustrated in the example in Appendix 4. If a reaction is studied, the team needs information on the reaction process including heat and gas flows, exotherm onset temperatures, and the physical and chemical properties of the mixtures as well as the individual components. Again, the ability to define a design intention for each stage is an essential requirement.

One major difference between continuous and batch operations is that a physical item may need to be considered several times in a batch HAZOP study as the status, conditions, and design intention change. Thus, a reaction vessel may be considered during the addition of each component of the reaction mixture, during the reaction stage itself, and then during cooling and discharge. Another example is the common pipeline operation of pigging, where a typical sequence involving the loading of a scraper pig into a pig launcher at the start of the operation might be:

• Check the initial conditions.

• Open the LP flare valve and vent the vessel.

• Open the drain valve. Allow the launcher vessel to drain for 5 min.

Then close the drain valve, leaving the launcher drained and at LP flare pressure.

• Close the LP flare valve and purge the pig launcher with inert gas by repeated pressurization to 5 barg and then venting to the LP flare until hydrocarbon gas tests show it is gas-free as measured at a representative sample point.

• Lock open the atmospheric vent valve and lock closed the drain valve and master isolation valves, leaving the vessel at atmospheric pressure.

• Check double block valve vents for any sign of leakage.

• Open closure door, load the scraper, and then shut the closure door.

The scraper is now loaded but not launched.

The pig launcher is at the center of each of these steps but each one involves a different configuration and usually different contents and pressures. The main issues will differ from step to step as will the design intention. Hence, the parameters will vary between the steps. Each of these steps should be considered separately, using the full round of guidewords each time to ensure that the hazards are fully examined.

Further requirements for batch process HAZOP studies are intended trip settings for both the control system and the safety system, including those that take place between successive stages of the process. The HAZOP team must take into account the manner and timing of the resetting of the control and trip systems, covering both safety and operability aspects.

Another difference from continuous processes is the need for the team to picture the whole operation and the changing conditions throughout the plant at all stages of the batch. Without this understanding, interactions and consequences may be overlooked. Indeed, as the progress of one batch is followed through its various stages, a previous batch may still be in a connected section of the plant and preparations for a following batch may be underway. Thus, a deviation in the batch being followed through may cause an interaction with the previous or the following batch and so have consequences for these batches. The HAZOP study team needs to have a clear overall picture to enable it to identify such cross-connections; time-related flow charts, for example, a bar chart, are needed to give this picture. Such charts are unlikely to be available from the design work and, if needed, must be prepared for the HAZOP study. Good preparation and organization of the data can greatly enhance the prospects of success in batch operations.}





The detailed HAZOP study procedure described in the previous chapter needs to be fitted into an overall scheme. This chapter covers the preliminary organization while Chapter 6 covers the study itself.

### 5.1 DEFINING THE SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY AND ESTABLISHING THE BOUNDARIES

These two aspects are not independent of each other although they are discussed separately. This part of the planning contributes significantly to the eventual quality of a HAZOP study. A clear definition of the scope and objectives is crucial to the whole study and should define the responsibilities and authority of the team (see also Section 6.1). It should also cover responsibility for initiation of the study, for followup and implementation of the actions, and how any rejected actions are dealt with. A well-defined set of objectives helps prevent the team straying into areas that are not relevant to the study. Quality assurance (QA) and auditing of the study should also be planned from the outset so that the study and the recording facilitate any later checks.17,18 

It is normal practice to include the identification of SHE risks as a principal objective, including risks to persons both on- and off-site, risks to property and plant, and all types of environmental risks. It must be made clear whether a further objective is to search for potential operability problems that by themselves have no SHE implications. These include reliability and maintenance issues, product quality or loss, and factors affecting plant life and productivity. Meeting regulations, company standards, and contractual performance requirements may also be a defined objective. Consideration should also be given to the intended uses for the study reports, in particular the need for audit and demonstration that a high standard has been reached in the identification of hazards and the assessment of risk. This may be required by both outside regulators and by insurance assessors. If it is expected that QA is required, the issues must be addressed during the definition of the scope.17

The boundaries for the study must be clearly defined as part of the specification of the study, including how any problems that extend beyond these boundaries will be handled. The first step is to identify those sections of the physical plant which are to be included. When boundaries are drawn, consideration is given to factors such as the nature of the process and the inherent hazards, the novelty of the operation, the complexity of the control system, and the relationship to other operating units. Where an existing plant is being considered, perhaps with a new process, it may be possible to omit from the study those sections that are used in a standard manner (although it may still be necessary to consider the effect that changes in the new section can have on the “standard” section). Also, if a standard unit or a proprietary unit is to be studied, it may be more effective to concentrate on the interfaces between that unit and other plant and operations. The unit may then be covered by comparison with a previously completed, full HAZOP study of the unit—an approach described as HAZOP by-difference. However, this should be done with care as there may be some small differences which could have a significant impact on operability.

When the study boundaries are drawn, there are likely to be interfaces with off-section elements of the plant such as drains, recycle lines, vents, and effluent treatment and perhaps sections of plant intended for occasional use for special purposes such as start-up lines. Consideration must be given to the inclusion of these within the HAZOP study, recognizing that interfaces with systems handling process materials are of potential importance. It is essential that such elements of the system are not overlooked simply because they are not on the drawings being used. The team needs to have an overview of the whole system so that important off-section causes and consequences are not overlooked, especially when associated with unusual events such as a plant trip. An interface review may be needed to clearly identify what crosses the boundaries.

There can be difficulties in setting boundaries when a modification to an existing plant is to be studied. As well as covering the modified sections of plant, it is usually necessary to extend the boundaries on either side to ensure that related sections, where causes of deviations that affect the modification and where consequences of deviations appear, are covered by the HAZOP study. It is a matter of judgment for the team leader.

Another aspect to be established at the outset of a study is the range of operational modes covered. For a continuously operating plant the main condition is the steady-state operation, but it is necessary to cover other modes such as start-up and shutdown (see Section 11.8), high and low rate running, hold conditions—particularly those anticipated during start-up—and changeover from one state to another. These may involve quite different pressure, temperature, or flow conditions compared to steady-state operation and may need detailed examination. Since many of them are discrete operations, they need to be examined using the batch HAZOP approach. For a batch operation, the additional modes could be special batches at the start and conclusion of a campaign or alternative control modes, such as fully automatic and partially manual. It is useful to think through the life cycle of the operation when deciding which alternative conditions should be included. It must be decided whether these alternative operational modes need separate examination or whether they can be covered under the guideword “other.”

It is not possible to estimate the length of a study or to plan in detail until these boundaries have been established.

### 5.2 APPOINTING A TEAM LEADER AND SELECTING THE TEAM

#### 5.2.1 The Team Leader/Facilitator

The selection of a team leader should be made at an early stage of the planning for a HAZOP study. An essential role of the team leader is to ensure the HAZOP methodology is used effectively and productively and so the leader needs to have a deep understanding and considerable experience of HAZOP studies. HAZOP study teams work best when there is clear leadership from an experienced leader. Desirable attributes for the leader include:

• wide experience of all the stages of process hazard studies, including QRA;

• extensive experience as a HAZOP study member and, preferably, some as a HAZOP study scribe;

• training in the leadership of HAZOP studies;

• technical competence and the ability to quickly understand the system and its operation;

• meticulous attention to relevant detail;

• good analytical thinking;

• motivational skills including the encouragement of creativity and open speaking;

• independence from the project itself with no other direct responsibility to the project manager other than completing the scope of the HAZOP study. The leader should be able to concentrate on the application of the method and the working of the team.

Independence from the project allows the leader to stand back and be able to take an objective, unbiased view. The leader acts, and is recognized to act, as an impartial person within the team. Freedom from other responsibilities is important because of the multiplicity of tasks already resting upon the leader. It is also advisable to check the suitability of the leader for the magnitude of the task, with only experienced and proven leaders given studies involving major hazards or other difficulties.

A good leader will have interpersonal skills that can be deployed to help the study group to function as a true team. These include the ability to listen, guide, and encourage individual contributions as and when required, to sense the unspoken feelings of individuals—perhaps indicated by their body language—to move the group toward a conclusion when a consensus is emerging and to work efficiently with the scribe. Within the HAZOP process, the leader directs the route taken through the stages, the parameters and guidewords. It may be necessary to vary from the preset plan by introducing new parameters and guidewords, to question doubtful issues and to defer examination—perhaps to gather more information—and to periodically review and remind the team of the key issues. The leader has responsibility for ensuring that the HAZOP study is functioning to a high standard and, if it is not, to call for changes which will restore these standards. In an extreme case, this could mean terminating a study until acceptable drawings, project information, or other team members are available.

A good leader working with a badly-selected team may be able to produce an adequate HAZOP study. The quality of the leader is critical and a good team cannot always negate the impact of a poor leader. If the team loses confidence in the leader, the study is doomed.

#### 5.2.2 Scribe (Scribe/Recorder)

The scribe is another key individual in the team. The person chosen must be familiar with the HAZOP study method and usually has a technical background so that special explanations are not required. The scribe must be a good listener, always paying attention to details. In a major study, the scribe has no other role, as recording is a full-time task. In a small study—for example, a modification—or on a self-sufficient small site, the recording may be done by the team leader or a team member. Note that experience shows that the scribe cannot be contributing to a discussion and writing at the same time so this inevitably slows the study.

The scribe should establish a working relationship with the leader to become a helper, not just a recorder. Help can be given by noting suggestions and deferred problems and bringing them up at a later time, and by assisting in the selection of guidewords and parameters. More directly, the scribe starts to record as a consensus appears, without waiting for instruction or dictation from the leader. To do this the scribe must learn when to write if recording manually (or to type if recording electronically)—starting too soon is a waste of effort while waiting for a final version to be dictated can slow the progress of the study and interferes with the creative flow of the discussion. The team should know exactly what has been recorded. This may be done by the leader reviewing the entry, the scribe reading it back or, if a computer recording program is in use, having it projected so all of the team can see the record.

The choice of computer recording over a simple written record is a matter of preference as both methods can produce good records. If a projector is used—as is common practice—it must be understood that during the meeting the priority is to capture the essential points of the analysis; spelling is not a high priority as it can be improved later but there must be no ambiguity or incompleteness in the first record.

It is important the study records are produced consistently and speedily after each session, particularly in a lengthy study, and that final and agreed versions are produced.

#### 5.2.3 Team Size and Membership

The size and composition of the team varies according to the complexity of the study. The minimum size for even the smallest study is probably four with some of the roles combined. Usually there is a core team of five or six. Occasionally, the number may be as large as eight or nine; team membership should be reviewed if this is exceeded. A typical team might involve the following personnel:

• team leader;

• scribe;

• process engineer;

• project/design engineer;

• plant/operations manager;

• operator (or commissioning team representative for a new design);

and one or more, as and when required, from;

• SHE expert (mandatory in some countries);

• research chemist;

• control/instrument engineer;

• maintenance/mechanical engineer;

• other specialists.

The essentials for the team members are that they have sufficient experience in the area of the operation and, as a group, have a comprehensive knowledge of the intended operation. In addition, the basic disciplines represented should ensure that a fundamental analysis of identified problems can be made. The key is the assembly of individuals who, together, provide the correct combination of basic disciplines and expertise, and general experience of the type of operation to cover all stages of the project. The disciplines needed may be a selection from chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineering, control systems engineering, chemistry, biochemistry, and other disciplines which offer specialist knowledge, when necessary, of reactors, piping, instrumentation, software, and metallurgy. General experience within the industry should average several years per member, including direct relevance to the intended operation with regard to the site, the method of control, and type of process. These latter aspects may be covered by the inclusion of a senior supervisor. Direct project involvement ranges from the initial research and development, earlier hazard studies, process design and the intended construction, commissioning, operations, control and maintenance groups.

It is possible that in complex processes which have a number of operating interests that the membership may be “dynamic.” If this is the case the new team members must be given sufficient time to appreciate the direction and dynamics of the HAZOP study and be able to fit into the team at the appropriate time. Likewise a departing member should be satisfied that there is no further use for his/her team membership before departing from the team.

Compromises often have to be made when selecting the team. The ideal persons may not be available and there can be difficulties if a big team results from an attempt to meet all of the criteria suggested above. In a large team—say nine or more—separate conversations may start, making it difficult for the leader to capture everything and disrupting the unity of the team. The leader must make a balance to achieve the best possible results. The potential for conflict is greater in a large team; it is a responsibility of the leader to be alert to developing problems and to prevent them from becoming major issues.

Whenever a new design or a modification to an existing plant is studied, the team should always include a representative from the design group, from the operations team, and it is likely to include an instrumentation engineer. Other team members are then chosen according to the nature of the project. Possible further members could be a mechanical engineer, development chemist, electrical engineer, software specialist, and safety specialist. It may be possible for the safety specialist to also act as the team leader. A good team is likely to have several members who are closely involved with the project and one or more who have little or no previous connection. It should not consist solely of those who have worked full time on the design nor should it be totally independent of the project. The interaction between these two groups can improve the quality of the study. Some companies like to have an independent process engineer present to act as a critical questioner and challenger of assumptions, another role that can be filled by a truly independent team leader who has the necessary background.

In a normal HAZOP study where several meetings are required, it is important to have the core team members present at all the study meetings. Apart from the development of a team style and spirit, this maximizes the benefits from the growing understanding of the operation that comes as the study progresses. If one member of the team is from an operating team working on shifts, however, it may be impractical to have the same individual present at all the meetings. Specialists are added to the team when their expertise is needed for a particular section or stage.

It is important that some of the team have previous experience of HAZOP study; if some have not participated before, then training should be considered. Provided a few members are experienced, the others can be introduced by a short example or, if a single individual is involved, by a briefing and then by participation within the otherwise practiced team.

### 5.3 PREPARATION

It is important for the team leader to assemble and review the necessary data for the study and, if necessary, to reorganize the material for use by the team or to call for additional data. In this work, the leader may be assisted by a member of the design team and by the scribe. A site visit by the whole team can be very useful when an existing plant is studied but this is not always practical.

Knowledge of previous incidents on the plant or process being studied is important. A search should be made of appropriate accident databases to identify historic incidents relating to the type of process and to any specialized equipment being used. These may be corporate or international databases.

The boundaries for the study must be known and clearly stated. In the case of a continuous process, the boundaries will start at the feedstock and end at the final product distribution. It may be appropriate for a member of the plant producing the feedstock and another from the final user to partake in the appropriate phase of the HAZOP study. Minor changes in product specification as the result of a modification must be treated with care.

It is also necessary to plan the route the study will follow through the process; this must be done with care. There will be a number of branches and also heat exchangers which have process fluids on both sides. As a general guidance it is best to examine the route using the logical process flow but where there are branches or interactions, such as heat exchangers, it is appropriate to discuss the major issues that must be examined at the branch or on the other side of the heat exchange and then to make note of these for discussion at a later date. For example, the reduction in flow (low flow) on one side may have an impact on the other side of the heat exchanger and that process stream. Likewise a spared pump is a potential branch. It is appropriate to examine the interaction between the pumps but not to carry out a full HAZOP on each unit as that would be a repetition of effort. A note to the effect that the units are identical and only one plus the interactions was studied would be appropriate, provided the P&ID is truly identical in each case. Another issue might be the use of spared heat exchangers on fouling duty. The changeover and the impact of two heat sources on the process and pressure relief must be considered in detail. (See also the notes on vents and drains in Section 11.6.)

As a generalization a continuous process will start up (and shut down) in a “low flow mode.” This must be part of the study. Likewise the start-up and shut down will involve dynamic changes in pressure and temperature (see Section 11.8). The HAZOP study must examine the whole envelope of these parameters. In some cases, particularly compressors and pumps, the low flow mode may require special startup facilities which will only be used very occasionally. These must be examined with the same rigor as the rest of the process.

Following shut down the HAZOP study must examine the disposal or storage of off-specification materials which may contain contaminants including corrosive and toxic by-products.

This preplanning work is normally undertaken by the team leader, often with help from a member of the design team.

对于团队领导来说，集合并审查研究所需的必要数据十分重要，如有必要，还需要对材料进行重新组织以供团队使用，或者需要调取额外的数据。在这项工作中，领导可能会得到设计团队的一员和书写员的帮助。在研究已有的工厂时，全体团队的现场访问可能非常有用，但这并不总是切实可行。

了解被研究的工厂或流程中的先前事件是很重要的。应对适当的事故数据库进行搜索，以确定与流程类型和任何正在使用的专门设备相关的历史事件。这些可能是公司的或国际的数据库。

必须清楚并明确地说明研究的边界。在连续过程的情况下，边界将从原料开始，结束于最终产品的分发。可能需要由产生原料的工厂的一员和最终用户的另一员参与 HAZOP 研究的适当阶段。由于修改而导致的产品规格的细微变化必须谨慎对待。

还必须计划研究将遵循的流程；这必须小心处理。会有一些分支和在两侧都有流程流体的热交换器。作为一般的指导，最好使用逻辑过程流来检查路径，但在有分支或交互的地方，如热交换器，应当讨论在分支处或热交换的另一侧必须检查的主要问题，然后记下这些以备后期讨论。例如，一侧流量的减少（低流量）可能会影响热交换器的另一侧和那个过程流。同样，备用的泵是一个潜在的分支。有必要检查泵之间的交互，但不应对每个单元进行完整的 HAZOP，因为那将是重复的努力。只要在每个案例中 P&ID 确实完全相同，那么声明单元是相同的，只研究了一个加上交互就合适。另一个可能的问题是在脏污工作中使用备用的热交换器。必须详细考虑切换以及两个热源对过程和压力释放的影响。（也参见第 11.6 节关于排气口和排水口的说明。）

总的来说，连续过程将以「低流模式」启动（和关闭）。这必须是研究的一部分。同样，启动和关闭将涉及压力和温度的动态变化（参见第 11.8 节）。HAZOP 研究必须检查这些参数的全方位。在某些情况下，特别是压缩机和泵，低流模式可能需要特殊的启动设备，这些设备只会非常偶尔地使用。这些设备必须和过程的其他部分一样严格地进行检查。

关闭后，HAZOP 研究必须检查废料或存储的不合规格材料的处理，这些材料可能包含包括腐蚀性和有毒副产品在内的污染物。

这项预计划工作通常由团队领导进行，通常会得到设计团队的一员的帮助。

#### 5.3.1 Continuous Processes

For a good HAZOP study to be possible, it is necessary for the team to have a complete and accurate process representation. For continuous operations this is based upon the P&ID, supplemented by design specifications and other details used in the design work, including flow diagrams, and material and energy balances. Further items are the intended operating conditions—usually expressed as a range—the operating and control philosophy and methods, and equipment and instrument specifications. Relief settings are essential to allow verification of pipe and vessel specifications, and alarm and trip settings should be normally available. In addition, there should be material properties, hazards and known operating problems together with the basis for safety, site details, and demands on the site services, and the results of earlier hazard studies including any material and reaction investigations. Information on vendor packages needs to be available.

Once the required level of detail has been obtained, the next planning task is the division of the P&IDs into sections and items to which the guidewords can be applied. Alternative terms may be used to describe the blocks selected for examination. The term “section” is used in this guide for part of a continuous process to which the guidewords are applied; another frequently used term is “node.” The term “item” is sometimes used for vessels, exchangers, and so on, to which restricted or modified guidewords are applied. In a batch process, the terms step or stage are commonly used. A HAZOP study is a rigorous but time-consuming, and hence expensive, exercise. The higher the number of sections or steps, the more time-consuming is the study. Ideally, no sections should feature a process line junction and no steps should cover more than one element of the batch sequence. Experience suggests that some branching within a section and some step combination can be tolerated on systems other than those of very high hazard potential. Defining the intention helps demonstrate that the team have selected a worthwhile manageable node. Designation of the sections and steps is best undertaken by the leader at the outset of the study. Since this task is critical to the integrity of any HAZOP study, it is essential the leader has a proven track record in HAZOP management (see Section 5.2.1, page 31).

The selection of the sections is usually based upon the line diagram together with a description of the operating conditions. Often there are several possible ways of doing this division based upon the variation of parameters such as flow, pressure, temperature, and composition, at control points or junctions of lines with vessels. It is essential each section can be given a clear design intention and that a conceptual model can be constructed for the system in its given mode of operation. The size of the section contributes to effective analysis as there are problems in choosing either too small or too large a section. In the former case, there will probably be causes of deviations outside the section and consequences occurring upstream or downstream. There is a danger of these being overlooked. If too large a section is taken, then the design intention may be imprecise or very complicated so that it becomes difficult for the team to cover all possible meanings of each deviation. No simple, universal method can be given for the division into sections; experience is essential. The example in Appendix 3 provides an illustration.

It can be useful to mark each line and item of plant equipment as it is studied during the operating sequence. A final check can then be made to ensure all lines and items have been considered.

A further feature of continuous processes is that a high proportion of incidents and near misses occur when the plant is operated at conditions other than the steady state—for example, during start-up after maintenance, during commissioning, or shutdown. Therefore, it is important for the plan to give sufficient attention to these conditions and to the deviations that might occur in these situations—for example, too rapid heating or cooldown to the operating temperature, inadequate purging, or protective systems overridden. The team should also be mindful of the need for diagnostic instruments that will facilitate process performance monitoring and allow the assessment of local and wider heat and mass balances. These may be needed to allow assessment of heat exchanger performance, efficiency of pumps and compressors, and fouling of filters and piping, and can be of great importance during incidents.19 

During start-up, it is sometimes necessary to override protective systems such as low temperature or pressure trips during what is an unsteady operation with a high risk of upset. The HAZOP study must pay particular attention to the process dynamics and risks with the protective system overridden and how the protective system will be reset (see also Section 4.5, page 19).

为了进行一次好的 HAZOP 研究，团队需要有一个完整和准确的过程描述。对于连续操作，这基于 P&ID，并由设计规格和设计工作中使用的其他细节来补充，包括流程图，以及物质和能量平衡。进一步的项目是预期的操作条件 —— 通常表示为一个范围，操作和控制哲学和方法，以及设备和仪器规格。需要有救济设定以允许验证管道和容器规格，通常应该可以使用警报和跳闸设定。此外，还应该有材料属性，风险和已知的操作问题，以及安全依据，现场细节，对现场服务的需求，以及早期危险研究的结果，包括任何物质和反应调查。需要有关供应商包的信息。

一旦获得了所需的细节级别，下一个计划任务就是将 P&ID 划分为可以应用指导词的部分和项目。可能使用其他术语来描述选择进行检查的块。在本指南中，「部分」一词用于指导词应用的连续过程的一部分；另一个常用的术语是「节点」。「项目」一词有时用于指应用受限或修改的指导词的容器，交换器等。在批处理过程中，通常使用步骤或阶段这些术语。HAZOP 研究是一项严谨但耗时且因此昂贵的运动。部分或步骤的数量越多，研究就越耗时。理想情况下，不应有部分具有流程线路连接，步骤不应覆盖批处理序列的多个元素。经验表明，可以在非高危险潜力系统上容忍部分的一些分支和步骤的组合。定义意图有助于证明团队选择了一个有价值的可管理节点。最好由领导在研究开始时确定部分和步骤。由于这项任务对于任何 HAZOP 研究的完整性至关重要，因此领导必须在 HAZOP 管理方面有证明过的成功记录（参见第 5.2.1 节，第 31 页）。

选择部分通常基于线路图以及操作条件的描述。通常有几种可能的方式可以基于诸如流量，压力，温度和组成的参数变化在控制点或与容器交汇的线路处进行这种划分。每个部分必须有明确的设计意图，且可以为其给定的操作模式构建一个概念模型。部分的大小有助于有效的分析，因为选择过小或过大的部分都存在问题。在前一种情况下，可能会有偏离的原因在部分之外，并且可能会有后果发生在上游或下游。有可能被忽视的危险。如果选取了过大的部分，那么设计意图可能会不准确或非常复杂，以至于团队难以覆盖每个偏离的所有可能含义。对于划分为部分，没有简单的，通用的方法；经验是必要的。附录 3 中的例子提供了一个说明。

在操作序列中，对每条线和每个工厂设备进行研究时标记它们可能会很有用。然后可以进行最后的检查以确保所有的线和项目都已考虑到。

连续过程的另一个特征是，大部分事故和近乎失误发生在工厂运行在稳态之外的条件下 —— 例如，在维护后的启动过程中，在调试或关机过程中。因此，计划需要充分关注这些条件以及在这些情况下可能发生的偏差 —— 例如，加热或冷却到运行温度过快，清洗不充分，或保护系统被覆盖。团队还应意识到需要诊断仪器，这将有助于过程性能监测，并允许对本地和更广泛的热量和质量平衡进行评估。这些可能需要用于评估换热器的性能，泵和压缩机的效率，以及过滤器和管道的污垢，而且在事故期间这些都至关重要。

在启动过程中，有时需要覆盖诸如低温或压力跳闸之类的保护系统，在这种运行不稳定并有高风险的扰动情况下。HAZOP 研究必须特别关注覆盖保护系统的过程动力学和风险，以及如何重置保护系统（参见第 4.5 节，第 19 页）。

#### 5.3.2 Batch Processes and Sequential Operations

The preparation work for a batch or sequential operation is usually more demanding than for a continuous process. In addition to the same range of background material, descriptions are also required of the detailed method of operation, the draft operating procedure, and the outline of the control sequence for a computer-controlled process. This time-dependent information is used in the division of the operation into stages for study, as illustrated in the example in Appendix 4. If a reaction is studied, the team needs information on the reaction process including heat and gas flows, exotherm onset temperatures, and the physical and chemical properties of the mixtures as well as the individual components. Again, the ability to define a design intention for each stage is an essential requirement.

One major difference between continuous and batch operations is that a physical item may need to be considered several times in a batch HAZOP study as the status, conditions, and design intention change. Thus, a reaction vessel may be considered during the addition of each component of the reaction mixture, during the reaction stage itself, and then during cooling and discharge. Another example is the common pipeline operation of pigging, where a typical sequence involving the loading of a scraper pig into a pig launcher at the start of the operation might be:

• Check the initial conditions.

• Open the LP flare valve and vent the vessel.

• Open the drain valve. Allow the launcher vessel to drain for 5 min.

Then close the drain valve, leaving the launcher drained and at LP flare pressure.

• Close the LP flare valve and purge the pig launcher with inert gas by repeated pressurization to 5 barg and then venting to the LP flare until hydrocarbon gas tests show it is gas-free as measured at a representative sample point.

• Lock open the atmospheric vent valve and lock closed the drain valve and master isolation valves, leaving the vessel at atmospheric pressure.

• Check double block valve vents for any sign of leakage.

• Open closure door, load the scraper, and then shut the closure door.

The scraper is now loaded but not launched.

The pig launcher is at the center of each of these steps but each one involves a different configuration and usually different contents and pressures. The main issues will differ from step to step as will the design intention. Hence, the parameters will vary between the steps. Each of these steps should be considered separately, using the full round of guidewords each time to ensure that the hazards are fully examined.

Further requirements for batch process HAZOP studies are intended trip settings for both the control system and the safety system, including those that take place between successive stages of the process. The HAZOP team must take into account the manner and timing of the resetting of the control and trip systems, covering both safety and operability aspects.

Another difference from continuous processes is the need for the team to picture the whole operation and the changing conditions throughout the plant at all stages of the batch. Without this understanding, interactions and consequences may be overlooked. Indeed, as the progress of one batch is followed through its various stages, a previous batch may still be in a connected section of the plant and preparations for a following batch may be underway. Thus, a deviation in the batch being followed through may cause an interaction with the previous or the following batch and so have consequences for these batches. The HAZOP study team needs to have a clear overall picture to enable it to identify such cross-connections; time-related flow charts, for example, a bar chart, are needed to give this picture. Such charts are unlikely to be available from the design work and, if needed, must be prepared for the HAZOP study. Good preparation and organization of the data can greatly enhance the prospects of success in batch operations.

#### 5.3.3 HAZOP Study of a Procedure

Many operations, both simple and complex, are dynamic and are done by following a strict, predetermined procedure. Any failure to strictly adhere to the procedure or to ensure all the steps are done in the correct order may have the potential for a serious consequence. Startup and shut down operations normally follow a sequence set out in a procedure, and these operations are known to be common occasions for problems and incidents. Hence, all procedures should be considered for evaluation by HAZOP study. The general principles of HAZOP study, as discussed in this monograph, hold good but the approach has to be altered to get the best results. This is described below and illustrated in Appendix 5.

The major difference from the examination of a steady-state operation is that procedures are carried out in a chronological order and so each step must be considered in turn and be challenged by appropriate guidewords. Thus, instead of traditional parameters such as flow, and guidewords such as more, potential problems are more likely to be uncovered by deviations such as operation mistimed or guidewords such as too early/too late or out of sequence. However, this does not preclude the use of the usual parameters and guidewords used in the HAZOP study of steady-state processes.

As ever, the team must have a clearly defined node and design intention for the step being examined. The node may be a piece of equipment such as a pump or a pig launcher. It may be a section of line, as might be selected for steady-state HAZOP study, but where the flow is not fixed but is dynamic due to moment-by-moment changes during the procedure. The node may include a number of simple operations that comprise a clear section of the procedure, for example, a series of valve changes in starting a pump or changes of flow, quantity, and temperature for the start-up, shut down, or conditioning of a reactor. Arriving at the best selection of nodes is often more difficult than when planning for a continuous process HAZOP study.

The choice of guidewords is also more challenging. The guidewords too early/too late, out of sequence or incomplete, could identify missed venting in the pump start-up or residues left in the reactor. Further possible guidewords are tabulated in Section 10.2 on Human Factors. Of course the standard guidewords given in Table 4.1 should also be used if they generate meaningful deviations with the parameters of the node.

Good practice, as with HAZOP study of steady-state operations, is to identify appropriate guidewords and parameters before the study is commenced, and it is the responsibility of the team to adapt the method of study to suit the problem being examined.
