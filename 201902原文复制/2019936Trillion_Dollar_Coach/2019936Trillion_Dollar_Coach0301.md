GET TO THE TABLE

In the 1980s, the majority of executives at technology companies were men; there were very few women.*5 Deb Biondolillo was one of those women, the head of U.S. human resources at Apple. Still, when the weekly CEO staff meeting rolled around, Deb would sit in the row of chairs along the wall, not at the table. Bill couldn’t stand this.「What are you doing back there?」he would ask Deb.「Get to the table!」Finally, one day Deb got to the meeting early and nervously grabbed a seat at the table. The other guys filtered in, and one of them, Al Eisenstat, ended up sitting next to Deb. Al was a dynamic executive, Apple’s general counsel, and one of its heads of marketing prior to Bill, a powerful man who was instrumental to Apple’s early growth. He was also well known for being rather gruff. When he took his seat that day, he was surprised to see Deb sitting next to him, at the table.「What are you doing here?」he barked.

「Going to the meeting,」she replied, with more confidence than she felt.

「Al looked at me for a few seconds,」Deb says.「Then he looked over at Bill. That’s when I knew it would be okay. Bill would back me up.」

More than anyone we have ever encountered in our careers, Bill was an advocate for women being「at the table.」He believed in diversity on teams well before it was a common topic. This is counterintuitive: Bill swore, loved football and a good dirty joke, perfected the guys’ trip, and loved beer. He was a real guy’s guy. Most of this「guy」activity, except for the swearing, took place outside the workplace, but not entirely. And it likely made at least some of the women around Bill feel excluded from time to time; some women may not feel comfortable telling jokes over beers at a sports bar. Yet all of the women we talked to about Bill felt comfortable with his style, because they saw firsthand that Bill was a straight shooter who delivered tough messages with respect, warmth, and candor.

We learned early on from Bill that when it came to creating teams, you have to put your bias blinders on (and that we all have biases). To him it was simple. Winning depends on having the best team, and the best teams include more women. A pair of 2010 studies bear Bill out on this point. They examined collective intelligence in teams: why are some teams「smarter」than the sum of their individual IQs? The answer is threefold: on the most effective teams everyone contributes rather than one or two people dominating discussions, people on those teams are better at reading complex emotional states, and . . . the teams have more women. This can be partly explained by the fact that women tend to be better at reading emotional states than men.6 So Bill always pushed us to consider women for any senior positions; he believed「you can always find a woman for a job, it may just take a little longer.」He helped recruit them when he could, such as when he got Ruth Porat to come on board as Google’s CFO in 2015.

He pushed the women he coached to be more aggressive in seeking bigger roles and more P&L responsibility, particularly in jobs outside of「typical」female areas such as HR or PR.* He connected successful women he knew with other successful women. He had zero tolerance for any gender bias in business conversations.

Bill helped bring Eve Burton to the Intuit board and worked with her extensively in her role as SVP and general counsel at Hearst, the media conglomerate. He coached Eve on various content deals she was negotiating, and the two of them collaborated on a journalism and technology partnership between Columbia and Stanford. But none of this work was more important to Bill than the HearstLab, a business「greenhouse」for women-led companies that Eve started at Hearst under Bill’s prodding and tutelage. Those companies now have a collective value of more than $200 million!「It was the last thing he pushed me to do,」Eve says.「His vision was to give women a place to seed their companies and make them successful.」

And a place to get some grass stains, too. One day, Diane Greene was attending an Intuit board meeting when she and Bill started chatting about their kids. Diane’s son was playing flag football at his middle school, and her daughter, in fifth grade, had complained that it wasn’t fair that the boys got to play football and the girls didn’t. Bill told Diane to come to Sacred Heart, the private school in nearby Atherton, on Thursday afternoon, and to bring her daughter. He didn’t say why. When Diane and her daughter arrived, they saw a bunch of middle school girls practicing football. Bill was on the field coaching them, with as much energy (and colorful language) as he did the boys’ team.「He wanted her to see that girls can play football, too,」Diane says.「He was coaching a football team; it didn’t matter that it was girls. He found the time to fit it in and hardly even talked about it.」

He took time to talk to adult women’s teams, too. For example, not long after she became CEO of MetricStream, Shellye Archambeau formed a group of women CEOs to support and mentor each other. She invited Bill to come to one meeting, and they all enjoyed it so much that it became a regular event. They would gather in the conference room at Bill’s office in Palo Alto and spend a couple of hours talking about a particular topic du jour. Bill prepared for and usually orchestrated the meeting. He didn’t tell the women what to do; rather, he told stories about his experiences and asked questions.

In most of the discussions, the fact that the CEOs around the table were all women didn’t even come up and wasn’t particularly relevant. However, when diversity did come up, or when some of the women related some of the biases they had experienced, Bill always got frustrated. He reminded them to think of the other women around the table when opportunities come up. This can be a problem: a 2017 Harvard Business Review article notes that sometimes members of minority groups hesitate to bring other members of that group into their organizations because they don’t want to be perceived as giving special treatment, and they worry that the people they bring in might not「make the grade.」7 So Bill always told Shellye’s group that if they were looking for board members, look around the group first.

Shellye thought of Bill when she launched a diversity program for women at her company’s office in Bangalore, India. They had more than a thousand people there, 30 percent of whom were women, at the time a high percentage for a tech company in India. Not long after launching the program she traveled to the office to check in on business and see how the initiative was going. She gathered the diversity committee and the leadership team into a conference room that was a bit too small. There were not enough chairs at the table for everyone. Shellye noticed that the women who filed in all took the chairs around the edge of the room; the men automatically sat at the table. She stopped them and instructed the women to sit at the table and the men to move to the outer chairs. Then she proceeded with the meeting.

When it was over, she asked the men how it felt to be sitting against the wall, not at the table. Um, weird and uncomfortable, they responded.

Exactly, she replied. To truly include everyone, everyone needs to be at the table.

SOLVE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM

There is another issue with the largely cognitive approach to management, which we had big-time at Google. Smart, analytical people, especially ones steeped in computer science and mathematics as we were, will tend to assume that data and other empirical evidence can solve all problems. Quants or techies with this worldview tend to see the inherently messy, emotional tension that’s always present in teams of humans as inconvenient and irrational—an irritant that will surely be resolved in the course of a data-driven decision process. Of course, humans don’t always work that way. Things come up, tensions arise, and they don’t naturally go away. People do their best to avoid talking about these situations, because they’re awkward. Which makes it worse.

When that happens, people refer to the「elephant in the room」: the big problem that overshadows everything but that no one acknowledges. As former Avon CEO Andrea Jung says,「With Bill there was never an elephant in the room.」Or, more accurately, there might have been an elephant, but it wasn’t hiding in the corner. Bill wouldn’t allow that. He brought the thing front and center.

「It’s a football mentality,」Shona Brown points out.「Where’s the weakest link on the offensive line, or the defensive secondary?」Throughout her tenure at Google, Shona worked weekly with Bill tackling numerous operational issues, many of which were lurking like elephants in the corner. The company was just growing so fast, well ahead of any semblance of process. Bill’s approach, Shona says, was always to tackle the hardest problem first.「You have to address that first.」

A litmus test for when issues have simmered for too long, a way to spot the elephant, is if the team can’t even have honest conversations about them. This is where the coach comes in, as a「tension spotter.」

Of course, another word for tension is politics. When you hear people saying that things are getting「political,」that often means that problems have arisen because the data or process hasn’t led to the best decision. At that point, personalities take over. As we discussed earlier, this was anathema to Bill.「For us, political stuff is very toxic,」he wrote Jonathan.「We have managed to become a big company with a wonderful absence of politics.」The reason we accomplished that, he failed to mention, was his own diligence in tackling the toughest, ugliest problems head-on. He would, as former Google head of communications Rachel Whetstone says,「beat the politics out of the situation」by bringing up the problem clearly, then forcing everyone to focus on it.

There was one situation we had a few years ago where two different product leaders were arguing about which team should manage a particular group of products. Both could legitimately argue that the products belonged on their team. For a while, this was treated as a technical discussion, where data and logic would eventually determine which way to go. But that didn’t happen, the problem festered, and tensions rose. It was causing problems within the teams, and with external partners as well. Who was in control?

This is when Bill got involved. There had to be a difficult meeting where one exec would win and the other would lose. Bill made the meeting happen; he spotted a fundamental tension that was not getting resolved and forced the issue. He didn’t have a clear opinion on how to resolve the matter, on which team the product belonged, he simply knew we had to decide one way or another, now. It was one of the most heated meetings we’ve had, but it had to happen.

DON’T LET THE BITCH SESSIONS LAST

The launch day of Apple’s second-generation iPhone, the iPhone 3G, did not go well. Each new phone that was sold was required to connect to Apple servers in order to be activated and functional. But the morning the phones went on sale, July 11, 2008, the servers ran into technical issues and went down. People could buy new phones but couldn’t activate them. Furthermore, anyone who had an older version iPhone and tried to upgrade to the new iOS operating system (the first to support the App Store) found that their phones were rendered inoperable in the process. In techie jargon, their phones were「bricked.」

At Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Eddy Cue and his team gathered around the table in a conference room, trying to figure out what to do. It was「mass chaos, my worst day at Apple,」Eddy says.「All of these issues are coming in, we’re trying to figure out what the hell is going on, what are the issues? There was a ton of negativity in the room, people had been lining up all night and we couldn’t sell any phones!」The negativity, Eddy realized, was an issue itself.「We had to get down to focus, get our team thinking in the right way, stop worrying about selling phones, and worry instead about fixing the right problems.」

Which is what they did. The first step was to take down the iOS update so that people would stop trying to upgrade their original iPhones. And then they got to work on getting their servers up and running, which they did a couple of hours later. Bill Campbell wasn’t involved in this situation, but his influence was felt. Bill always made sure that problems were aired completely and transparently. And then, once that was accomplished, he moved on.

「That’s one of the big things he taught me,」Eddy says.「When it gets to the negative, get it out, get to the issues, but don’t let the damn meeting dwell on that. Don’t let bitch sessions last for very long.」Psychologists would call this approach「problem-focused coping,」in contrast to「emotion-focused coping.」The latter may be more appropriate when facing a problem that can’t be solved, but in a business context focusing on and venting emotions needs to happen quickly, so more energy is directed to solutions.8

Bill and the Apple board had plenty of chances to practice this approach in the days after Steve Jobs returned as CEO in 1997. It’s easy to forget how Apple, now one of the most successful and valuable companies in the world, was nearly bankrupt when Jobs came back. There were some tough times then, and even later, after the success of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, some very challenging issues. Bill’s approach was always to be levelheaded and constructive, to immediately focus on what they were going to do about it. Andrea Jung, who joined the Apple board in 2008, calls it「learning forward.」Not what happened and who’s to blame, but what are we going to do about it?

One way Bill was able to accomplish this trick was by staying relentlessly positive. Negative situations can be infectious, people get cynical, optimism fades.「In those early years we had some tough times,」Eddy says,「but Bill was by far the most positive board member we had.」It would be easy to dismiss this attitude as mere cheerleading, except that he was also relentless in identifying and addressing problems, which cheerleaders don’t do. Studies show that positive leadership makes it easier to solve problems, so Bill would praise teams and people, give them a hug, and clap them on the shoulder to boost their confidence and comfort. Then, when he asked the tough questions, everyone understood that he was on their side, and that he was pushing on things because he wanted them to be better, to be successful. He would always get to the heart of a problem, but in a positive way.9

Again, we feel the influence of coaching sports at work here. When we leave the office behind and go coach our kids’ soccer or baseball teams, we are always taught the value of「positive coaching,」of leading with praise and then following with constructive feedback. But when we get back to work, we forget all that and rip into people. We aren’t suggesting that everyone start treating their teams like kids on a playground, but Bill’s approach demonstrates that the same basics work even at the highest levels of an organization.

WINNING RIGHT

In sports, coaches and players talk about a「culture of winning」and the dynasties that have it. Discussion of the greatest sports dynasties must include the Boston Celtics (eight straight NBA championships from 1959 to 1966), São Paulo’s Santos FC (eleven titles from 1955 to 1969), UCLA Bruins men’s basketball (ten titles from 1964 to 1975), Manchester United (twelve titles from 1992 to 2011), and the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers (both with five Super Bowl wins, the Niners in the 1980s and ’90s and the Patriots from 2002 to 2017). Here are some other numbers that rank right up there: ten league titles in fourteen years. This is what Bill achieved with the Sacred Heart middle school flag football team. Sacred Heart is a private school in Atherton, California, one of the wealthiest zip codes in the United States. Bill turned it into a football dynasty. He would tell the kids, you aren’t the rich kids from Atherton, you’re the tough kids from Sacred Heart.

You can’t talk about coaching—or leading a company—without talking about winning. That’s what the good coaches do. That’s what great leaders do. Bill didn’t approach coaching at Sacred Heart any differently because it was middle school, or because it was an exclusive private school. Those things didn’t matter. It was still football, and you still played to win. He demanded commitment, passion, and above all, loyalty, just like in his business life. Sometimes a parent would come to him and explain that their son or daughter would be late to practice because he or she was playing soccer or some other sport. Bill’s reply was, that’s fine, and he was sure that their child would fare quite well . . . on the B team. They wouldn’t be playing on the A squad. Football would not be a second priority for any of his players, and no one got special treatment to accommodate an interest outside the team.

He demanded the same level of commitment from himself and his other coaches (all volunteers with demanding jobs). Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon in the fall, you would find Bill on the Sacred Heart football field, leading practice. Most people knew not to call Bill during those hours, but at least one person did not. Occasionally Bill’s phone would ring during practice and he would take it out of his pocket just long enough to see who was calling, and for the kids to get a glimpse at the caller ID. Then Bill would put the phone back in his pocket, letting the call from Steve Jobs go unanswered.「There was nothing cooler than knowing that for that hour at practice, we were the most important thing to him,」one of his players says.「We had his full attention.」

(Sometimes the young players had his attention even when he wasn’t with them. One time Bill came to a practice with a few plays that he had just created for the upcoming game. He had spent the day at a meeting at Google, he explained, and had drawn up the plays during the presentations.)

Still, winning wasn’t everything to Bill. Winning right was. He would often say he turned to business because he wasn’t a very good football coach (「Have you seen my record?」), which is debatable. But what’s not debatable is his ability to instill a culture of winning, and winning right. This is what Bill instilled at Sacred Heart, Google, and all the other companies he worked with. Todd Bradley, a former Hewlett-Packard executive who worked extensively with Bill, says that the biggest lesson he learned from him was about「the humanity of winning,」by which he means winning as a team (not as individuals) and winning ethically. Whether in business or in sports, it’s amazing what can be accomplished if you don’t care who gets the credit.

What’s remarkable to us, as we talked to numerous people who didn’t know Bill as a businessman but as a football coach, is that he treated his middle school football players the same way he treated his executive coachees (like us). The commitment and loyalty. The intolerance for lapses in integrity. The swearing (the kids started a「Coach Campbell Swore」fund, demanding ten bucks from Bill for every curse word; that fund became a down payment on the school’s new football field). The way he listened intently to the kids and would take them aside for quick 1:1s. The tough talk, and sincere love. It didn’t matter if you were a middle school kid or an exec at a big corporation: Bill’s approach didn’t waver.

The same thing worked for much more advanced football players, too. Charlie Batch grew up in Bill’s hometown, Homestead, Pennsylvania, and they grew to be friends over the years, working together to help Homestead. Charlie played quarterback at Eastern Michigan University and then for fifteen years in the NFL for the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers, who play their home games about ten miles from Homestead. In 2012, the starting quarterback for the Steelers, Ben Roethlisberger, got injured, and Charlie stepped in. Things didn’t go well in that game: Charlie threw three interceptions and the Steelers lost to the Browns. The week after that loss, Bill and Charlie saw each other at an event in Homestead. Bill didn’t do that finger-popping thing, but he might as well have. He had watched the game, and he chewed Charlie out pretty good, telling him to change his attitude, step up, take responsibility, and be a pro. Charlie was taken aback but not surprised. The coach was right.

The following Sunday, Charlie led the Steelers back from a ten-point deficit to beat their rivals, the Baltimore Ravens, and threw five completed passes on the winning drive. As he walked out of the victorious locker room he got a text from Bill:「Told you.」

LEADERS LEAD

When Dan Rosensweig joined Chegg in 2010, he had been told they were six months away from an IPO. In fact, they were about three months away from bankruptcy. But he righted the ship and led it to an IPO in 2013, whereupon the stock tanked, dropping well below its IPO price. Dan, feeling the strain after a tough multiyear slog, was privately starting to lose faith. Was this company going to make it? Was he the right guy to lead it? He was thinking about quitting but didn’t tell anyone.

Then he got a call from Bill, who had been coaching Dan for a few years, helping him through the ups and downs at Chegg.

「Dan,」he said,「let’s take a walk.」

「Right now? Should I come over?」

「No, we’re going to take a virtual walk, right here on the phone.」

Uh-oh, Dan thought, looking past the mini football helmets on his desk and out the window at the fountain in the courtyard below.「Where are we going?」he asked.

「Behind the woodshed,」Bill replied.

He went on to lecture Dan about how he needed to stick with it at Chegg. Leaders lead, he told him. You can’t afford to doubt. You need to commit. You can make mistakes, but you can’t have one foot in and one foot out, because if you aren’t fully committed then the people around you won’t be, either. If you’re in, be in.

「I don’t know how he knew I was thinking of leaving,」Dan says,「but he did. And he wasn’t having it.」Dan did not quit. He led. He rallied his team, which is still intact, and together they turned around and built the company.

It’s great and fun to talk about winning, but what about losing? Bill knew something about losing. His teams at Columbia lost a lot, and the startup he joined, GO, failed, losing a lot of investor money in the process.* Failure is a good teacher, and Bill learned from these experiences that loyalty and commitment are easy when you are winning and much harder when you are losing. But that’s, as Dan’s story highlights, when loyalty, commitment, and integrity are even more important. When things are going badly, teams need even more of those characteristics from their leaders.

At Columbia, after a particularly tough loss, Bill yelled at his team in the locker room; he really read them the riot act.「That was the team I lost,」he later said,「and that’s the moment I lost them.」He didn’t rally the team, he didn’t show them his loyalty, and he didn’t make decisions that might help them. He just yelled at them. This was a moment he filed away. The moment he truly lost.

Decisiveness also becomes more important in challenging situations, as illustrated by the final days of GO. In Startup, Jerry Kaplan describes a pivotal moment that came one afternoon when Bill requested that the company’s senior execs gather for an emergency meeting. The company had been struggling for a while, with virtually no sales and tough competition from Microsoft. Bill came to the conclusion that the company was not going to survive, much less be successful. He suggested to his team that they should sell the company, and after some discussion, they agreed. The reasoning, though, wasn’t financial per se. They didn’t want to sell to salvage at least some financial returns for themselves or for investors. They wanted to preserve the work they had done.「The important thing is to save the project and the organization—to protect what we’ve built,」Bill said. He hoped to accomplish this by selling to a larger company that could fund and continue the work, even if that meant he’d be out of a job. In this case, Bill’s loyalty wasn’t to the company so much as to the cause.10

So, when you’re losing, recommit to the cause. Lead. Nirav Tolia, currently CEO of Nextdoor, was the CEO of a dot-com startup called Epinions and a coachee of Bill’s. Epinions went through several near-death experiences before eventually merging with a company called DealTime and relaunching as part of Shopping.com. When Nirav and the board decided to start looking for that merger, he informed his management team. One of the key team members, let’s call him Bob, got spooked and within a few weeks left Epinions for a more stable situation.「That was a real body blow,」Nirav says.「It was very traumatic that he left.」Nirav got on the phone with Bill and told him about the departure. I’m coming over, Bill replied.

Nirav convened his team when Bill arrived at the office. Bill walked into the room.「I love you guys,」he said.「There’s something that’s really bothering me. Bob leaving, he betrayed us. He was disloyal. He left us in our time of need. Fuck him.」And that was pretty much it. Bill got up and walked out, not just out of the room but out of the building.

A few minutes later Nirav got a call, Bill again.「I bet no one else is going to quit on you now.」

FILL THE GAPS BETWEEN PEOPLE

Eric was involved in a Google meeting, with some people attending in person in Mountain View, and some (including Eric) joining via videoconference. They were discussing a few different issues, but they ran out of time and one of the issues didn’t get resolved. One person made a comment toward the end of the meeting, which Eric interpreted negatively. He felt sure, based on that one remark, that things weren’t going to go his way on the issue in question. The comment sat with him and festered for a full week, and by the time the group got back together, Eric was gunning for battle. That is when he realized, though, that he had completely misunderstood the comment and, as a result, the entire situation. The crisis was inadvertent. A lack of communication and an apparent slight had dug a fissure that was completely false.

This is not an unusual story. It happens every day: the offhand comment, the quickly drafted email or text, and people careen off in emotional directions way out of whack with reality. This is when a coach can really come in handy. As Bill described it, his job as our coach was to「see little flaws in the organization that with a little massage we can make better. I listen, observe, and fill the communication and understanding gaps between people.」The coach can spot those fissures before they become deep and permanent, and act to fix them by filling in the information gaps and correcting any miscommunication. Bill wasn’t involved in that meeting with Eric, but if he had been, Eric would have gone to him to test out his assumptions about the perceived slight. Bill would have corrected him—everyone was, in fact, aligned—and Eric would have been spared a lot of angst.

So what would Bill do? First, he would listen and observe. This is the power of coaching in general: the ability to offer a different perspective, one unaffected by being「in the game.」(Patrick Pichette:「Bill saw all the chess pieces all the time, because he had the luxury of not being on the board.」) Bill sat in Eric’s weekly staff meetings, listening intently, watching the body language of attendees, sensing mood shifts.

Marissa Mayer tells a story about Bill’s power of observation. She had started a new program at Google for people right out of college, computer science majors who were brought into the company as「associate product managers.」One day Eric told her,「Marissa, you’ve hired all the smartest twenty-three-year-olds on the planet. But they are driving everyone crazy. Either this becomes a home run or the whole thing blows up. Get them under control.」

Marissa turned to Bill. Could he help? He agreed to attend one of their meetings, an evening session where the first class of APMs gave updates on their projects and what problems they were having. Marissa thought the meeting was a failure—it was so boring! Just a bunch of people giving status updates and griping.

Bill observed something different. After the meeting he took Marissa aside. They are all getting stuck, he said, and you are the wrong person to help them. You’ve been here since almost the beginning and know how to get things done, so you can’t relate to the problems they are having. Get someone who will help them figure out what the next step is. Create a forum where they can help each other. That will fix the problem. And of course, he was right.

This is one example of the power of observation at work; listening, looking for patterns, assessing strengths and weaknesses. As Lee C. Bollinger says,「Bill had the highest capacity to understand the people he was working with. He had an intuitive sense of people and what motivated them and how to move them forward.」He accomplished a lot of this by looking for tension, the smoke to a problem’s fire. In Eric’s staff meetings, for example, he’d sit in the room, usually not saying much, sensing when tension levels were rising and from where. Our staff meetings were generally open, transparent affairs where everyone was encouraged to share opinions and ideas, even on issues not directly related to their functions. Still, that goes only so far. People would simmer, and Bill would spot it.

This requires keen observation. Not just listening to the words, but noticing the body language and the side conversations. So many of the people we talked to commented on Bill’s ability to sense when people were frustrated. This is a natural skill, but one that can be developed. You have to listen and watch.

Jim Rudgers, who was on Bill’s coaching staff at Columbia, recalls Bill’s remarkable ability to see the entire field of twenty-two players as a play unfolded. Hold up a finger and look at it, Jim says. That’s how most of us watch football; the finger is the player with the ball. But Bill could see, recall, and assess the things that happen on the periphery as well. He brought that skill to team meetings. He wouldn’t just see the speaker, he could see the entire field and gauge reactions and intents even with the people who remained silent, the ones without the ball.

Then he would talk to people. As Bill explained it one time at a Google management seminar:「I have a little more time than Larry does to do some of that stuff. I have a little more time than Sundar does to do some of that stuff, so, you know, I’ll say to Sundar, Do you want me to meet with so-and-so? Sure. And here’s what I’m going to tell ’em. You okay with that? Yeah. Great. Perfect, and, you know, that helps a little bit in moving the thing along. Let’s get it moving.」

Rachel Whetstone recalls a time a decision didn’t go her way when she was running communications and policy for Google. She was in one of Eric’s staff meetings, where they were discussing an important issue that had been causing PR headaches. She had been pushing for a change for a while, and when she didn’t get the decision she wanted, she was upset. She felt they were making a mistake. Bill sought her out after the meeting. Listen, he told her, we decided not to make that change to that particular thing this time. I’m sorry and I know it’s tough, but you’re going to have to suck it up. Deal with the problem, okay?

Not much of a pep talk, right? His advice was「deal with it」! But sometimes that’s all it takes. An acknowledgment that things didn’t go your way, some empathy that it sucks, a reminder to buck up and soldier on for the team. These were the sort of messages that Bill delivered all the time. Short, timely, and highly effective.*11

And while the skill of observing tension is a challenging one to develop, this idea of going around and talking to people is not. It simply takes time, and the ability to communicate well with colleagues. Bill could have noted Rachel’s frustration and simply forgotten about it; it wasn’t his job to fix her problem. But instead he made the effort to have a conversation with her. To make that short, important connection. It’s so easy to forget to have these little conversations in a busy day; Bill made it a priority.

While none of this was underhanded or secretive, it all had a behind-the-scenes quality. Bill rarely talked about these little 1:1 conversations; he would simply take you aside and have a few quiet words. This was all by design, another difference between a sports coach (who’s out in front, leading the team, highly visible) and a business coach. As Deb Biondolillo says, Bill was「the shadow behind you. You hear him, but you are the one in front. He could be less confined, more genuine if he was in the background.」

This was all done without an agenda. Bill often didn’t voice an opinion about which way a decision would go—he just pushed for the decision to be made. When he sensed those moments, he’d work behind the scenes, drawing out people’s points of view, closing communication gaps, and fixing miscommunications, so that when the time came to discuss things in the meeting and make the decision, everyone was prepared.

Then Bill would sit back, observe, and start the cycle over again.

PERMISSION TO BE EMPATHETIC

When you sum up the principles Bill used to build teams, and try to apply them as a manager, you give yourself, as Bradley Horowitz puts it, the「permission to be empathetic.」After a successful career in the valley at Virage and Yahoo, Bradley co-led development of Google+, followed by its far more successful offspring, Google Photos. He met with Bill several times over this span and was always impressed by how he invariably led off the meetings by talking about personal stuff: What was going on with Bradley’s family? What motivated him? Bill’s approach was to make the human connection first, then approach the work with that understanding.

「This touchy-feely stuff isn’t in the manual,」Bradley says.「It’s so easy to get wrapped up in the work of what we’re producing, and not how we’re doing it. But leading teams becomes a lot more joyful when you know and care about people. It’s freeing.」(One reason empathy isn’t in the manual, according to The Athena Doctrine, a 2013 book by John Gerzema and Michael D’Antonio, is that it is typically seen as a feminine trait.12 The proverbial manual was mostly written by men!)

Bradley got the chance to apply what he learned from Bill when he was tasked with figuring out what to do with Google+. The product had been launched with great fanfare as Google’s entry into social networking. Google+ failed to get widespread adoption, but a few components, including its photo management features, were quite popular. So Bradley and other team members devised a plan to spin Photos off as a stand-alone product. They got buy-in from senior leadership and got to work.

The problem was, many of the engineers and product managers who had worked on Google+, including many senior people, had left the team and in many cases the company. Many of those who remained on the team had never led a project of this scope before. Bradley and the team knew there was a great product market fit—it was the right product for mobile users who loved photos (just about everyone!) at the right time. But was it the right team to deliver and were they set up to succeed?

Bradley put Bill’s approach, the permission to be empathetic, to work. He prioritized his time to focus not on tactical and technical issues, but on team ones. He got to know and care about team members as people, pumped them up, pushed and implored them, then helped build momentum as they started to achieve important milestones. He focused on the team and not the problem, and the team responded. Senior leads started stepping up as Bradley gave them more freedom.

At one point, as the project was really starting to roll, one of the most important technical leads on the team came to Bradley. He knew he was performing well, and he demanded more power and responsibility, which he was currently sharing with another lead. If not, he would go to Facebook, which had just given him a very nice offer.

It didn’t take Bradley long to decide. The team that he had nurtured through empathy was more important than the one person.「I guess you’re going to Facebook,」he said.

PERMISSION TO BE EMPATHETIC

LEADING TEAMS BECOMES A LOT MORE JOYFUL, AND THE TEAMS MORE EFFECTIVE, WHEN YOU KNOW AND CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE.

* * *

Bill Campbell employed all of these techniques, from hiring well (pick the right players) to promoting gender diversity (get to the table) to taking care of small misunderstandings before they become big (fill the gaps between people), to help teams achieve greatness. And the essence of Bill was the essence of just about any sports coach: team first. All players, from stars to scrubs, must be ready to place the needs of the team above the needs of the individual. Given that commitment, teams can accomplish great things. That’s why, when faced with an issue, his first question wasn’t about the issue itself, it was about the team tasked with tackling the issue. Get the team right and you’ll get the issue right.

Chapter 5

The Power of Love

In February 2003, Brad Smith had just been hired as a new executive at Intuit. The hiring had entailed some drama, with a claim from one of Brad’s former employers that by joining Intuit Brad had violated some noncompete agreements. It took some time, lawyering, and money to work things out. Not long after the dust settled and Brad joined the company, he attended an internal Intuit leadership conference, where the top people from all over the world gathered to discuss the company’s plans and get to know each other better. It was a great opportunity for Brad to meet his new colleagues and make a strong first impression.

The first morning of the conference, as people filled coffee cups and caught up with friends and colleagues, Brad milled among them, exchanging handshakes and greetings. Suddenly he was grabbed from behind and wrapped in a bear hug. Bill Campbell’s first words to Brad:「So you’re the son of a gun who cost me so much money. You better be worth it!」Except he used a more colorful term than「son of a gun.」

We do not necessarily recommend that you greet new colleagues with hugs and curses. Personally, we still favor handshakes and more traditional conversational niceties. Everyone has their own style, obviously; hugs and curses was Bill’s. What’s more important is what it meant, to Bill and to the many of us on the receiving end. The reason Bill was able to get away with his hugs-and-curses approach was that all of his behavior was rooted in his heart: it came from love.「Get away」isn’t the right way to describe it; people looked forward to Bill’s hugs and profanities, because they meant he loved you.

Yes, love. Let’s be clear: the kind of love we are referring to here is entirely chaste. He never crossed the line or came close to it. He hugged just about everyone, and if he couldn’t get close enough to hug you, sometimes he’d blow kisses. Right there in the middle of a board meeting or Eric’s staff meeting, Bill would give you a wink and blow you a kiss. Everyone understood with great clarity the intent of the hugs and kisses: to show that he cared, to show that he loved.

Academic studies point out that there is a「compensation effect」between warmth and competence: people tend to assume that people who are warm are incompetent and those who are cold, competent.1 This of course was not the case with Bill; as Google cofounder Sergey Brin says,「He’s that great combination of a sharp mind and a warm heart.」But when Jerry Kaplan first met Bill at GO, he assumed he was just a「rough and tumble . . . middle-aged man.」2 Which means that you should lead with warmth, but know that you might have to work just a bit harder to build your reputation for competency.

Love is a word you don’t hear a lot in business settings. Oh sure, maybe people will express love toward an idea, a product, a brand, or a plan. Or to that dessert they are serving in the cafeteria today. But not to a person. We’ve all been conditioned and trained to separate our personal emotions from the business environment. We all want to hire people with passion, but only in the business sense, of course, lest the lawyers and HR people get concerned. So what happens, what we live with daily, is an existence where our human selves and working selves are practically separate beings.

But not Bill. He didn’t separate the human and working selves; he just treated everyone as a person: professional, personal, family, emotions . . . all the components wrapped up in one. And if you were one of his people, he cared about you fiercely and genuinely.「When Bill walked into the office at Benchmark, it was like a party arriving,」Bill Gurley says.「He’d walk around greeting people by name, hugging them.」After the hugs and greetings, he would talk about families, trips, friends. Bill was a coach of teams and a lover of people. What we learned from him is that you can’t be one without the other. Academic research, as usual, bears this out, showing that an organization full of the type of「companionate love」that Bill demonstrated (caring, affectionate) will have higher employee satisfaction and teamwork, lower absenteeism, and better team performance.3

Earlier in the book we recount a story from Jesse Rogers, about how when he launched his new company, Bill called him up and chewed him out about his crummy website. Jesse recalls that story through a combination of laughter and tears, then he notes something we heard a few times in our conversations about Bill. The ranting, the getting in his face over a crappy website,「came from a place of love,」Jesse says.「The concept of male love is something people aren’t used to talking about. When he is yelling at you, it’s because he loves you and cares and wants you to succeed.」

John Donahoe calls it, with appropriate reverence for Huey Lewis and the News,「the power of love.」「He had a way of communicating that he loved you. And that gave him license to tell you that you are full of shit and you can do it better . . . It was never about him. Coming from him, it didn’t hurt when he told you the truth.」

So this is what we learned from Bill: that it’s okay to love. That people in your team are people, that the whole team becomes stronger when you break down the walls between the professional and human personas and embrace the whole person with love.

Literally, in Bill’s case.

TOP TEN「BILLISMS」

Bill often had a unique way of telling you that he loved you. These are his top ten favorites, as recalled by his Columbia friend and teammate Ted Gregory. They were printed on the back page of the program given to guests at Bill’s memorial service.

10.「You should have that shirt cleaned and burned.」

9.「You’re as dumb as a post.」

8.「He’s one of the great horse’s asses of our time.」

7.「You’re a numbnuts.」

6.「You couldn’t run a five-flat forty-yard dash off a cliff.」

5.「You’ve got hands like feet.」

4.「You’d fuck up a free lunch.」

3.「You’re so fucked up you make me look good.」

2.「Don’t fuck it up.」

1.「That’s the sound of your head coming out of your ass.」

THE LOVELY RESET

「To care about people you have to care about people.」This seems like it should be some hoary quote; we heard it a few times in our conversations with people about Bill. It’s not, at least not one we can find anywhere online, so we will henceforth claim it. To care about people you have to care about people! You hear over and over again in corporate-speak that a company’s most important asset is its people, that businesses put their people first, that they care about their employees, that blah blah blah. These aren’t necessarily empty words; most companies and executives truly do care about their people. Perhaps just not the whole person.

Bill cared about people. He treated everyone with respect, he learned their names, he gave them a warm greeting. He cared about their families, and his actions in this regard spoke more loudly than his words. Jesse Rogers talks about how much his daughter cared for Bill, about how Bill always took the time, when he saw her, to give her a big hello hug. Ruth Porat says that when she took the job as Google’s CFO and started commuting back and forth from New York, Bill’s primary concern was how her husband was faring with the arrangement. Was he happy? What could Bill do to help out?「He cared about the whole you,」Ruth says.「We talked about that a lot.」

Sundar Pichai recalls that Bill would start every one of their weekly Monday meetings by asking about Sundar’s family and weekend and talking about his own.「I was always busy going into these meetings, with lots of things to do, but my time with Bill always gave me a sense of perspective. That whatever I was doing was important, but he showed me that what really matters at the end of the day is how you live your life and the people in your life. It was always a lovely reset.」Bill’s small talk about families wasn’t small at all. It provided his coachees a respite in a busy day and a chance to ease their work-family conflict at least momentarily.

Bill didn’t reserve his care just for executives. When Mickey Drexler was on the Apple board and traveled to Cupertino for meetings, he often stopped in the local J.Crew store (he was J.Crew’s CEO) at nearby Stanford Shopping Center. There the sales associates would often tell him about how his friend Bill had been shopping there. They loved Bill Campbell in that store. Bill learned the names of the salespeople, always greeted them warmly, and treated everyone with respect, as equals.「He acted the same way with the store associates as he did with the people on the Apple board,」Mickey says.「I learned from that.」

None of this feels that novel, does it? When we get together with colleagues, we often inquire about their families. The difference with Bill, and the hard thing to do in a busy business environment, is that he somehow found a way to get to know the families. Many times, he accomplished this simply by taking the questions a few steps beyond the「how are the kids?」norm. With Jonathan, it wasn’t just how was the family, it was how did Hannah do at her latest soccer game? Which evolved into where was she thinking about college? Which evolved into some detailed advice about where she would fit best. Then, when he’d see the family at various events, they’d get the same hug as anyone else.

Bill developed this habit early in his career. Marc Mazur, an advisor at Brightwood Capital, had known Bill since Coach Campbell recruited him to be a kicker at Columbia in the late 1970s. During the recruiting visit, Bill walked into the Mazur home and quickly surmised that it was a maternal one. I’ll always take care of your son, Bill told Mrs. Mazur. The following year, as a freshman, Marc injured the knee of his kicking leg. He was not going to be kicking field goals for the Lions, not that season or any other. Bill called Marc’s mom and told her that his promise held. He would still look after Marc, and he promised that Marc would not lose his financial aid if he couldn’t play. Marc was on the freshman team at the time, and it was rare for the varsity coaches, much less the head coach, to get involved with the freshmen. But Bill did, and Marc and Bill were close for the rest of Bill’s life, precisely because of the loyalty Bill showed Marc and his family.

Recruiting discussions like the ones Bill had with Marc’s mother surely proved to Bill the importance of having a team member’s family understand that the organization cares about the player, and vice versa. Nextdoor CEO Nirav Tolia was only twenty-six when he started working with Bill, and early in their relationship Bill asked for Nirav’s father’s phone number. After they talked, Nirav asked his father how the conversation with Bill went.「Fine,」came the reply, but「Bill asked me not to share the details.」Bill hadn’t just asked Nirav about his family; he talked to them.

This wasn’t the norm for Bill—once he left football, he didn’t typically talk to people’s parents. But there were plenty of instances when Bill cared about a person by caring about that person’s family, not just by asking about their well-being but by actually caring about them. In some cases (including Eric’s, who lost his father when he was twenty-six), Bill became a father figure to his mentees. Like Eric, Omid Kordestani lost his dad when he was young, and he came to see Bill as a father figure「who was full of heart and wisdom.」When Omid took over as executive chairman of Twitter, he got together with Bill to talk about the role, given Bill’s experience as chairman of Intuit, but they spent most of that time talking about family. Only after they covered the important stuff did they get to talking about Twitter.

And when the situation was more dire, Bill always made himself available to the families. When Mike Homer, a close friend and colleague of Bill’s at Apple and GO, fell ill with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Bill was a frequent visitor at his home and helped however he could, prioritizing Mike over his work at Google and other companies. He got to know Mike’s caregivers by name, always chatting with them.「He wanted to let them know that Mike was well loved by family and friends,」Mike’s widow, Kristina Homer Armstrong, says.「He hoped that would encourage them to do their very best.」

Similarly, when Steve Jobs became incapacitated by cancer, Bill visited him nearly every day, whether Steve was at home, in the office, or in the hospital. Phil Schiller, Apple’s longtime head of marketing, worked with and was friends with both of them. He recalls,「Bill showed me that when you have a friend who is injured or ill or needs you in some way, you drop everything and just go. That’s what you do, that’s how you really show up. That’s what Bill would do. Just go.」

Caring and compassion can have a tremendous impact on an organization. When Bill was CEO of Intuit, one of his team leaders, Mari Baker, had a medical issue while traveling on a business trip and was hospitalized. When Bill got wind of the situation, he chartered a jet to fly Mari’s husband to the East Coast to be with her and bring her home. At first blush, this seems like merely a generous gesture, but in fact stories like that can signal the devotion of the leader to the entire company and engender tremendous loyalty in return.4

Mark Human, who runs the El Dorado Golf and Beach Club in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, tells a similar story about an employee of his. Bill had a vacation home at El Dorado and got to know Mark well during his years of vacationing there. Mark was a young manager, still in his twenties, when he met Bill, and today he recalls how Bill would always take the time to say hello, give him a hug, and whisper something positive in his ear. That stuck with Mark.「You have to take the time to smell the roses, and the roses are your people,」he says.「Recognize that people want to talk to you about other things than just the job.」Mark had one employee who was badly injured while helping out a family at the club. Mark helped rally a support group to get the young man the months of medical care that he needed; now he is completing his education and returning to work at the club.

Mark and his staff also take the time to make the annual year-end employee party a truly special occasion. People get dressed up, and no matter your level or background, you dance. Mark’s turnover rate is low compared to the numerous other resorts in Cabo, which he attributes to the culture he helped create that was inspired by Bill.

Compassion isn’t just good, it’s good for business, and a 2004 paper argues that compassion at an individual level, such as what Bill and Mark demonstrated, can turn into「organizational compassion」when team members collectively notice, feel, and respond to pain experienced by team members. This happens when the organization「legitimates」that empathy, for example when leaders like Bill or Mark take the lead in helping individual team members. Compassion can start at the top.5

In our own lives, we don’t try to match the way in which Bill loved people. We don’t hug; we don’t go quite as deep into people’s family lives. We don’t call their fathers! If you don’t naturally have as big a heart as Bill’s, faking it won’t work. Repeat: don’t fake it! But most of us like our coworkers. We care about them, but we check all but the most sanitized feelings at the door when we walk into the office. Bill taught us to do the opposite. Bring it in! Ask the questions about the family, learn people’s names, then ask more questions, then look at the pictures, and, above all, care.

THE PERCUSSIVE CLAP

Imagine you are presenting a new product to the Apple board, sometime in the 2000s. Perhaps you are nervous as you walk into the room. There’s Steve Jobs, there’s Al Gore, and in between them sits Bill Campbell. You start talking about the product; maybe it’s the new iPad or iPhone, maybe it’s the latest Mac operating system. You talk about the timing, when the product will be released. Then you hold your breath and give the demo.

Sometime around then, the clapping starts.「Bill would clap and cheer, give double fist pumps, he would get so excited!」Phil Schiller recalls.「He provided an emotional reaction to the products, not a dry, boring, revenue-driven board reaction. He’d be out of his seat, an explosion of emotion.」The effect of this wasn’t so much about the approval of the product. It was about approval of the team.「It always felt like your uncle or dad just gave you appreciation and respect,」Phil says.「That’s one of the biggest things I learned from Bill. Don’t just sit your butt in the seat. Get up and support the teams, show the love for the work they are doing.」

「Everything Bill brought to the boardroom came from a place in his heart,」says Bob Iger, CEO of Disney and an Apple board member. But there was another purpose behind the enthusiasm besides showing love for the team.「Once he started the applause,」Bob says,「it was hard to disagree. The applause felt like it was coming from the board, not just Bill. It was his way of cheerleading, but also of moving things along.」When Bob told us that, a little lightbulb went off. That was so Bill; of course that’s what he was doing! With one gesture, a short outburst of enthusiastic clapping, he would both tell the team that he loved their work, giving them all a big pat on the back, and keep things moving. Bill’s raucous cheerleading didn’t just signal his approval, it generated momentum among the entire group in the room. What a brilliant technique!

Clay Bavor, the head of virtual and augmented reality products at Google, recalls a similar thing happening. In April 2015, Clay presented at a Google executive product review, showing off a new virtual reality headset and camera. After demoing the new gear, he passed out a low-end virtual reality viewer called Cardboard that Google had created and proceeded to walk everyone through a demo of a new app designed for the device. The program was called Expeditions; it let teachers take their classes on virtual tours of important sites around the world. Which meant that in this demo, Clay was the「teacher」and the executives were his「students.」Clay felt a bit awkward, but suddenly, from the back of the room, came Bill’s loud applause.「It was percussive,」he says.「Like a gestural exclamation mark.」Not a full round of applause, just five loud claps.「It really put me at ease. Like he was saying that what we did was cool, and it broke the ice for other people in the room to also get excited.」

Today Clay has incorporated the「Bill Campbell clap」—the BCC—into the culture of the team. When someone announces something good in a meeting, someone else will erupt with five loud claps. If someone gives a burst of applause in the office, people will ask,「What was the BCC for?」Clay includes the BCC in training given to new team members; they even practice it in orientation. That team has hundreds of people now, every one of whom has learned Bill’s percussive clap.

ALWAYS BUILD COMMUNITIES

Super Bowl XIX was played in January 1985 at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, walking distance from Bill’s home. The stadium was a large bowl, built in 1921 and lined with wooden benches renowned for leaving patrons with splinters as souvenirs of the day spent sitting and watching a game.* So when the Super Bowl came to town, Bill and the marketing team at Apple spied an opportunity: they lined the entire stadium, 80,000-plus seats, with cushions emblazoned with the Apple logo on one side and the Super Bowl’s on the other. Since the game was practically in his backyard, and since he was personally responsible for saving the backsides of tens of thousands of fans, Bill decided to check it out for himself. He gathered a few of his buddies at his house, and together they walked to the stadium, picking up Steve Jobs en route. It was a great game on a cool, misty day. The 49ers beat the Miami Dolphins, and the guys all enjoyed themselves immensely.

This was the beginning of Bill’s Super Bowl group, which rallied for the game every year. Bill would get the tickets and arrange transportation, while Columbia buddy Al Butts arranged hotels. The original group included Bill, Al, and their Columbia friends John Cirigliano and Ted Gregory. It grew to include, at times, Donna Dubinsky; Bill’s brother Jim and his daughter Renee and her husband; Al’s son Derek; Dave Kinser, his wife, Norma, and a rotating selection of their four kids; Spike Bloom (a friend from Kodak and Apple) and his son; Columbia buddy Gene Schatz; and Bill’s kids Jim Campbell and Maggie Campbell and friends of theirs. They’d show up in the Super Bowl city on Thursday or Friday, find a good bar to make their temporary headquarters, and while away the time until kickoff, as Al says,「with lots of bad jokes, put-down exchanges, laughter, and the occasional deep conversation.」

One year, when Bill had extra tickets, he gave them to a couple of incredulous kids whom he had spotted trying to buy cheap tickets from a scalper. When the sputtering scalper wondered why Bill had just given away something so valuable, Bill responded,「Because now the kids can enjoy themselves.」Another year, when a couple of people had to cancel at the last minute, Bill invited the servers from the restaurant where the gang had dinner the night before to join them at the game. The women were delighted to accept!

「The Super Bowls were important to Bill,」Al says. Not the game, but the group.「Bill’s friends and their interactions with him and each other were enormously significant to him.」When Bill passed away, he wanted to make sure that the tradition of the trip continued in his absence. So he endowed it. We’ve heard of people endowing scholarships, but a Super Bowl trip? That was Bill. He was so committed to ensuring this tradition continued that he left enough money to pay for it for at least another decade.

And that wasn’t the only Bill trip. There was the annual baseball trip, which always included a Pirates game in Pittsburgh, a visit to Homestead, and a couple of other games in the Eastern time zone. There was the「yips and salsa」golf trip to Cabo San Lucas. There was the journey to the annual College Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony. There was the annual fishing trip to Butte, Montana, where Bill helped spearhead an annual charity event. All of these trips were endowed by Bill when he left us, so his friends could keep going even in his absence.

Back at Homestead, he sponsored the high school reunion, ensuring that his old gang could get back together on a regular basis. And even before he coached at Sacred Heart, he put together events after games where all the families could gather for a beer or a soda and a burger, to talk about the game and tell stories. Paying was never an option. Bill remembered his days as an assistant football coach at Boston College, when he noticed that some of the other coaches would sometimes skip social engagements, perhaps because they couldn’t afford them. He wanted to make sure nobody skipped an event due to financial constraints, so he always picked up the tab.

The common thread with all these trips? Community. Bill built community instinctively. He knew that a place was much stronger when people were connected.

He cared so much about community that he invested in a place for people to gather. The Old Pro was a sports bar that opened in 1964 at the corner of El Camino Real and Page Mill Road in Palo Alto in a funky steel Quonset hut of unknown provenance. Bill started going there with his Intuit team in the 1990s, and when the bar was forced to move in the mid-2000s, he helped its owners Steve and Lisa Sinchek set up at a new, swankier location in downtown Palo Alto. Bill could be found there most every Friday afternoon, holding his own version of TGIF. Different people gathered there, always with plenty of food and beer, and when someone new showed up, Bill introduced him or her around with a generous spirit: he picked your best feature or accomplishment and highlighted it. The only rule was that you couldn’t come there with an agenda. No one came to the Old Pro to「network」or to talk about deals. Bill liked the bar for its casual atmosphere, where formalities could drop by the wayside and people could just be themselves, whether laughing at old stories or talking business. It was the physical manifestation of the numerous communities he created. It is still one of the most popular spots in Palo Alto.

Bars seem to be a theme in Bill community-building stories. Phil Schiller tells the tale of the time Bill received an honorary degree from Boston College, where Bill had been assistant football coach before moving to the head job at Columbia. Phil is a BC grad and attended the ceremony. Afterward, Bill turned to Phil and suggested they head over to Mary Ann’s, a well-known dive bar near campus. When they got there, Bill told the bartender that the Bud Lights (Bill’s brew of choice) were on him that night, not just for their group but for the entire bar. It was graduation, so naturally the bar started filling up with proud parents and newly minted alums, most of whom were greeted with a cold one and a bear hug from an old football coach.

Community building has many similarities to the team-building practices we discuss in the previous chapter. To Bill, it was all part of a grand approach. Once you have your team or your community, what matters most are the bonds between the people on the team, which are forged by caring for each other and the common good. With all the trips Bill took with people, the trips were not the goal of the communities, the communities were the goal of the trips. It was all about making enduring connections between people, generating what sociologists call「social capital.」6 As John Cirigliano, a lifelong friend of Bill’s dating back to their time at Columbia, says,「Bill fed off of the energy of people in his communities, the energy they generated as a result of being part of the community, and the same can be said for the people that he coached. In that way, he was a sort of perpetual motion machine.」

Bill was fortunate enough to be able to afford a rather luxurious form of community building. Most people can’t sponsor annual Super Bowl trips or buy a bar! But there are many ways to create social capital. Many of the people we talked to commented on Bill’s penchant for connecting them to others; he was extraordinary at that. You would be talking to him about something and he would say, you should talk to so-and-so, I’ll put you in touch. Minutes later the email would be on its way. He didn’t do this randomly or for the sake of it; he made a quick calculation that the connection would be beneficial for both people. Which is a pretty good definition of community.

His get-togethers at the Old Pro are another example; for the cost of a few pitchers of beer, he gathered people on a weekly basis. Community building doesn’t have to be expensive.

This principle may be easier to grasp in a social setting than a business one. Bill never talked to us about communities; he talked about teams. But we learned by observing his community activities. Invest in creating real, emotional bonds between people. Those are what endure and what make teams truly strong.

HELP PEOPLE

Susan Wojcicki was an early employee at Google and spoke with Bill frequently over the years. A few years back, Susan, who was by then the head of YouTube, wanted to attend an important tech and media conference. Despite YouTube’s status as one of the biggest video destinations for consumers around the world and an important player in the media and entertainment world, Susan could not secure an invitation. She worked through her considerable list of contacts, to no avail. In her 1:1 with Bill, she brought this up. He responded with a burst of colorful language.「This makes me so angry!」he said.「Of course you should be there!」They ended their meeting soon afterward, and a day later an invitation to the conference appeared in her inbox.

Bill did Susan a favor. He made a few calls and got her the invite. This is such a simple thing, but something surprisingly unusual in companies. We have had a couple of situations over the years where we asked colleagues to do us favors. These were not big favors, but they did entail bypassing processes or waiving minor rules. No one would have been hurt, and in fact the things we requested, if judged on merit alone, were absolutely the right things to do. Nevertheless, we were turned down. I’m sorry, I can’t do that, was the generic response. You see, we’ve got this process in place . . .

To which Bill would have said: bullshit. Bill believed in doing favors for people. He was generous, he liked to help people, so when he could call on a friend to help the CEO of YouTube get into an event at which she absolutely belonged, he did it without hesitation. And it wasn’t just fellow executives he helped. Bill got to know one of Jonathan’s admins, a young woman named Chadé; they would chat on those rare occasions when Jonathan kept Bill waiting outside his office. One day Bill asked Chadé what she was up to, and she mentioned that she was considering studying for the LSAT and that she wanted to go to law school. Chadé was worried about how Jonathan would feel about the timing of her possible departure and struggling with when to apply and what and when to tell her boss.

When Bill saw Jonathan after meeting Chadé that day and told him about their conversation, Jonathan admitted that he didn’t know his admin had her sights set on a number of top schools.「You should get to know your people better!」Bill told him.「Go out there and tell Chadé you’ll survive no matter when she goes to school. And since you’re her boss, make time and write her a recommendation. It’s your job.」

That next year, Chadé matriculated at Columbia Law School. She graduated a few years later and now practices law in Boston.

Bill enjoyed helping people and was incredibly generous. Good luck buying a dinner or a drink when Bill was around. One time, when he had a group of friends together in Cabo for vacation, Bill took all the kids to dinner; everyone got the bar T-shirt. He bought cases of very nice red wine to pour at his annual Christmas party, not because he enjoyed wine, but because he enjoyed watching his friends enjoy wine. You might think, well, heck, it’s easy for a rich guy to buy everyone T-shirts and wine, and you’d be right. But Bill was that way well before he was rich. He had a generous spirit, which anyone can afford. For example, he was a very busy man, but he was generous with his time. Sometimes it took a couple of months to get on his calendar, but if you truly needed him, that phone call would come right away.

Most of the time, these little gifts were what Adam Grant, crediting businessman Adam Rifkin in his book Give and Take, calls「five-minute favors.」They are easy for the person doing the favor, requiring minimal personal cost, but mean a lot to the recipient.7 Grant also notes, in a 2017 article written with Reb Rebele, that「being an effective giver isn’t about dropping everything every time for every person. It’s about making sure that the benefits of helping others outweigh the costs to you.」People who do this well are「self-protective givers.」They are「generous, but they know their limits. Instead of saying yes to every request for help, they look for high-impact, low-cost ways of giving so that they can sustain their generosity—and enjoy it along the way.」8

Helping people and being generous tie right back to the concepts of love and community we cover in this chapter. If your best friend asks you to do a favor, you do it, right? You love your friend, you trust her judgment (usually), you would do anything for her, so when she asks you to do something that would help her and is the right thing to do, there’s no hesitation. But if she’s your colleague at work, suddenly it’s not so easy. You get those lines we heard: there’s a process I have to go through, someone might somehow perceive that it’s not fair, etc. So you don’t do the favor.

We learned from Bill that it’s okay to help people. Do favors. Apply judgment in making sure that they are the right thing to do, and ensure that everyone will be better off as a result. Then do the favor.

LOVE THE FOUNDERS

One of the outcomes of Microsoft’s failed attempt to buy Intuit was that Bill got to know a woman who at the time was the product manager on Microsoft Money, a product that competed with Intuit. Although the deal failed, she and Bill stayed in touch. She later left Microsoft and joined a Seattle startup called Amazon, and soon thereafter called up Bill and asked for an introduction to John Doerr. Bill made the introductions, and Kleiner Perkins ended up investing in Amazon.

A few years later, in 2000, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and CEO, took some time off to spend time with his family. He had hired a COO, Joe Galli, but when he returned from his leave, the company was struggling. The board, which included Doerr and Scott Cook, was wondering if perhaps Jeff should step aside as CEO and elevate Joe to that role. Jeff would stay on as chairman and maybe have some other function. This had worked for Intuit when Bill replaced Scott as the CEO. But John and the others weren’t sure. They asked Bill to spend some time in Seattle and report back.

Bill started traveling back and forth to the Pacific Northwest, going to the Amazon offices a couple of days per week, sitting in on management meetings and observing the company’s operations and culture. After a few weeks, he reported back to the board that Jeff Bezos needed to stay as CEO. In his book about Amazon, The Everything Store, Brad Stone writes that「Campbell concluded Galli was unnaturally focused on issues of compensation and on perks like private planes, and he saw that employees were loyal to Bezos.」9

Bill’s recommendation came as a surprise to some board members, but his assessment carried the day and Jeff stayed as CEO, obviously with great success.

We have talked so far in this chapter about the love Bill had for people, and how it is so important for leaders to care about their people beyond the restrictive norms of the typical corporate environment. As long as we’re on the topic, there’s another type of love Bill prized: love of founders. He held a very special place in his heart for the people who have the guts and skills to start companies. They are sane enough to know that every day is a fight for survival against daunting odds and crazy enough to think they can succeed anyway. And retaining them in a meaningful way is essential to success in any company.

Too often we think about running a company as an operating job, and as we have already examined, Bill considered operational excellence to be very important. But when we reduce company leadership to its operational essence, we negate another very important component: vision. Many times operating people come in, and though they may run the company better, they lose the heart and soul of the company, the vision that is going to take it forward. This is where founders excel. Bill loved founders, not just for the chutzpah they possess to try entrepreneurship in the first place, but for the vision they have for the company, and the love they have for it. He understood their limitations, but he usually felt that their value outweighed the shortcomings.

Bill saw this scenario play out a few times. Perhaps the most spectacular example was at Apple. Bill was there when the new「business guy,」John Sculley, came in as CEO, and he observed as Sculley eventually forced out cofounder Steve Jobs. Many years later, when Steve returned to Apple, he asked Bill to join the board to help him do what seemed impossible: save the company, which was only a few months away from bankruptcy. Steve needed to change so much, to force the company to regain its singular focus on building superb products. He had to move fast, so he needed people he trusted to help him. Bill was at the top of that list. As they got to work, they became not just confidants but close friends. They took long walks together nearly every weekend, talking about Apple issues but also other things. Bill understood founders and understood why Steve was so exceptional. He supported Steve and was careful to protect him from the many who pursued him seeking one thing or another.

As Phil Schiller recalls,「They were like friends coming back together at a college reunion and trying to do one more thing together. Steve needed his help and strength to support the plan. Sometimes he just needed an arm around the shoulder.」

Bill was the business guy brought into GO, where founder Jerry Kaplan stayed on as a very important presence for the life of the company. Then he was the business guy who joined Intuit to replace Scott Cook as CEO. Again, Scott stayed on, to this day, as a very important presence. And Bill helped with perhaps the greatest and most challenging pairing of founders and incoming CEO, in coaching Eric, Larry, and Sergey at Google.

His principle every time: love the founders, and ensure they stay engaged in a meaningful way regardless of their operating role.

When Dick Costolo took over as CEO of Twitter, Bill counseled him to work well with the company’s founders, Biz Stone, Jack Dorsey, and Evan Williams. Today you are the CEO and they are the founders, Bill said, but someday you will be the ex-CEO and they’ll still be the founders. It’s not you versus them; it’s you and them. You are here to help them.

Many business leaders outside the startup world never have to grapple with the founder question, as the company’s founder may be long gone by the time they join. Nevertheless, the essential argument in favor of founders remains: Vision is an important role. Heart and soul matter. Often that is embodied in the founder, but many other people may also embody what the company stands for, its mission and spirit. They don’t show up on a balance sheet, income statement, or org chart, but they are very valuable.

THE ELEVATOR CHAT

So many of the things we discuss in this chapter, indeed in this book, seem very personality dependent. Bill was perhaps the most「people person」we’ve ever met. So how does someone who isn’t so naturally inclined to love people do it? Practice.

Bruce Chizen worked with Bill at Claris and later went on to become the CEO of Adobe Systems. When he first joined Adobe, in 1994, Bruce remembered what he had observed Bill do at Claris and tried to do the same. But it didn’t come so naturally to him.「I tried to remember people’s names,」Bruce recalls.「When I ran into someone in the elevator, I’d start up a dialogue, how’s it going, what are you working on? I would go out of my way to have lunch in the cafeteria with new people. I would put myself in interactions that were not as natural for me, but it made a difference.」

Bruce attributes his success at Adobe in part to these more social aspects of his work there. Before he ascended to the CEO spot, the company’s founders asked him to take over products, something quite unusual for someone with a sales and marketing background. Their reasoning was that engineering leaders had developed a great deal of respect for him, due to his willingness to engage them and their developers in conversation.

The principles we outline in this book may not feel natural, but they can be learned. The key is pushing yourself to do it. When you’re in that elevator, passing someone in the hallway, or seeing a group from your team in the cafeteria, take a moment to stop and chat. Bruce’s lines are as good a starter as any:「How’s it going? What are you working on?」In time, it becomes natural.「Trying to develop that personal connection didn’t come that easily for me, but I worked at it,」Bruce says.「Fortunately, it gets easier.」

One of our big surprises in working on this book was how often the word love came up when people talked about Bill. This isn’t a typical word when speaking with tech executives, venture capitalists, and the like. But Bill made it okay to bring love to the workplace. He created a culture of what people who study these things call「companionate」love: feelings of affection, compassion, caring, and tenderness for others. He did this by genuinely caring about people and their lives outside of work, by being an enthusiastic cheerleader, by building communities, by doing favors and helping people whenever he could, and by keeping a special place in his heart for founders and entrepreneurs.

Love is part of what makes a great team great. Yes, this was a natural part of Bill’s personality—he was way more ebullient than most of us! But it was also something he likely learned from football.

Steve Young, a Hall of Fame quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, spoke of team love at a conference honoring Bill in September 2017.「Great coaches look beyond,」Steve said.「[49ers coach Bill Walsh] would get the team together every year and say, ‘Hey, guys, we’re going to integrate this team.’ There were all these little cliques—the safeties hang together, guys from different schools, socioeconomic backgrounds, geography, language, religion. He says, ‘I’m going to break all of those . . .’
