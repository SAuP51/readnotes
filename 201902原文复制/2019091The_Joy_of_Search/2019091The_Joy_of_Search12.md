What’s going on here?

I know the plants here are chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) and coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis), living side by side in large brushy zones.

But looking at these plants now was odd. Noticing this strange, plant-free boundary around most (yet not all!) of the plants on Black Mountain led me to ask the following research question:

Research Question: What causes the odd, plant-free gap around the plants in these photos?

Is there some way to figure this out with online research?

If it helps (and it might or might not), these photos were taken on August 13, 2013, at latitude/longitude 37.3195203, −122.1630756. Here’s what the place looks like in a Google Earth image (figure 15.3).

Look carefully at this brushy area marked by the red drop pin. I know that this is made up of chamise and coyote brush. When I was visiting, I noticed that you can see this kind of gap all around these plants. (The light-colored perimeter is where you can see the soil.)

What’s going on here? I looked carefully, and this gap at the periphery isn’t a trail of people or deer. (You can see deer trails weaving between the clusters of bush, especially to the west of the drop pin.)

So what’s causing this?

I began my search with a Google query like this:

[plant free zone OR area near chamise OR「coyote brush」]

Yet these results weren’t especially good. Looking at the search results, I learned a lot about how to create「plant-free zones」around houses, especially those that are built in chaparral or near fire-prone plants like chamise. From the US Forest Service website, I also learned a great deal about chamise, such as that

under natural conditions, dormant seeds accumulate in the soil until stimulated by fire to germinate. Chamise seeds are unpalatable and seedbanks apparently are not subject to heavy predation. Consequently, chamise seed densities increase over time. Seed density in the seedbank beneath 9-year-old stands was estimated at 2,000 seeds per square meter while in 85-year-old stands, seed density was approximately 21,000 seeds per square meter.1

Reading through these articles was interesting, but not especially useful. (Or so I thought. See below.) I needed to try a different research tack.

I completely modified my query to focus in on just chamise:

[plants not grow near chamise]

Now I had a bunch of new, additional results just about chamise. But one result struck my eye: a PDF from the Santa Cruz County Parks Department that said (in the snippet),「Chamise uses allelopathy, altering the soil as it drops leaves.」This sounded as though it MIGHT be relevant, so I clicked through to the landing page and found these lines that sound like our solution:「Some plants engage in chemical warfare, or allelopathy. Chamise accumulates toxic, water-soluble compounds as a result of normal metabolic processes. Fog drip and rain carry these toxins to the soil, where they inhibit the growth of competing plants.」2

Now this sounds like the right mechanism; this well might cause a zone around the chamise that would be pretty barren. This paragraph, however, uses a word that’s new to me:「allelopathy.」I already knew that something + pathy usually means that something was being killed off. Could it be that the seeds or plants near the brush was being killed? That was enough of a hint.

I looked it up. Even though I’m a professional researcher, I don’t know the meaning of every word, but this seemed promising.「Allelopathy」means「the chemical inhibition of one plant (or other organism) by another, due to the release into the environment of substances acting as germination or growth inhibitors.」This well could be exactly what’s happening to cause the plant-free zone around the bushes. Broccoli and black walnut, for instance, both exude substances that kill (or prevent from growing) plants living nearby. So maybe we’ve found the answer.

And now that I know this word, I remembered seeing it before—in the first set of results! Now I know what that word means and see in retrospect that my first hint was actually in the first search I did, if only I’d known.

This is now officially interesting, so I dug a little deeper into the allelopathy vein.

I thought what I’d do is to search for「allelopathy」for chamise, with the obvious query:

[allelopathy chamise]

Not only did I find a lot of new results, but I found myself in the middle of a scientific battle of explanations!

Here is the results page (figure 15.4).

As I read the first result, I was astonished: this link gives you an idea about what’s going on. In that article, published in 2004 (as part of the oldest botanical publication in the United States, the Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society), the author calls into question the idea that chamise is allelopathic.3 So I did a bit of searching and reading of these pages. I found out that on the「allelopathy side,」there are several publications arguing that chamise IS allelopathic and causes the plant-free zone around chamise:

Keeley, J. E., B. A. Morton, A. Pedrosa, and P. Trotter. 1985.「Role of Allelopathy, Heat, and Charred Wood in the Germination of Chaparral Herbs and Suffrutescents.」Journal of Ecology, 445–458.

McPherson, J. K., and C. H. Muller. 1969.「Allelopathic Effects of Adenostoma Fasciculatum, ‘Chamise,’ in the California Chaparral.」Ecological Monographs 39 (2): 177–198.

Notice that these publications are all a few years old. Science marches on, discovering new things all the time. Is the information in these articles still widely believed to be true? We should look for more recent work.

On the other hand, there are a few more recent publications that argue this is all wrong, that allelopathy isn’t really what’s going on here (at least for chamise):

Halsey, R. W. 2004.「In Search of Allelopathy: An Eco-Historical View of the Investigation of Chemical Inhibition in California Coastal Sage Scrub and Chamise Chaparral.」Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society, 343–367.

Weidenhamer, J. D. 1996.「Distinguishing Resource Competition and Chemical Interference: Overcoming the Methodological Impasse.」Agronomy Journal 88 (6): 866–875.

After reading a bunch of these papers, it becomes clear that the idea that chamise is allelopathic originated in Cornelius Muller’s original paper from 1953. Since then, though, the idea that chamise actively emits chemicals (or more likely, that the chemicals are leached off in rainwater over the plant) has been called into question.

There’s no doubt that some plants do emit compounds that suppress nearby growth, but the question being debated here is whether or not chamise is one of them. The articles are fairly detailed, with long sections describing how to test one idea or the other. It’s fascinating reading, if you’re into details of methodology (which I actually quite enjoyed, although maybe that’s just me), but I’ll summarize it by saying that these folks are still trying to figure it out.

Nevertheless, a nice summary of this entire debate is contained in a relatively recent book, Perspectives on Plant Competition, published in 2012. It concludes that allelopathy by chamise and other chaparral plants is「overrated … if not altogether fictitious.」4

Why this might matter is because some botanists are trying to figure out ways to harness plants’ natural allelopathic capability to do weed suppression in fields and perhaps farm without using any weed killer sprays on the crops. In essence, if chamise IS allelopathic, might it be possible to breed (or genetically engineer) a food plant that needs no weed killer, but can grow just fine on its own?

YET while reading Perspectives on Plant Competition, I looked up each of the citations in Muller’s work and in particular each reference in the text about allelopathy. In the process, I found this remarkable phrase:

[Here is some] experimental evidence supporting an alternative explanation for the bare zones around chaparral shrubs. Batholomew (1970) demonstrated that halos around some shrubs in the soft chaparral might be maintained by herbivory from animals inhabiting the shrubs. Successive attempts to test the relative importance of allelopathy versus herbivory in both the development and the maintenance of bare zones showed that chemical inhibition occurred in some species, but not in others and that the herbivory of unexclosed seedlings could be an intense as 100% (Halligan, 1973, 1975, 1976; Christiensen and Muller, 1975).5

I know that’s dense prose, but WOW! If you decode this text, it’s saying that animals are eating the small plants around the shrubs. That’s what「herbivory」means: animals eating plants.「Unexclosed」sounds like a double negative, but it really just means that there’s no animal-excluding fence around the small plants just outside the shrub. And not just some of the plants but instead up to 100 percent of them!

Looking up the Bartholmew reference,「Bare Zone between California Shrub and Grassland Communities: The Role of Animals,」we find that

previous studies have emphasized the role of volatile inhibitors of plant growth in producing this bare zone. However, there is a concentration of feeding activity by rodents, rabbits, and birds in this zone; if this activity is prevented by means of wire-mesh exclosures, annuals grow in the bare zone. Thus, animal activity is sufficient to produce the bare zone.6

Among other things, we now have a technical term for this region around the outside of chamise and coyote brush: bare zone. My next query was:

[「bare zone」chaparral]

Voilà! We have a lot of articles on the bare zone around chaparral plants, just as we’re seeing in the photos. The consensus of opinion now seems to be that the bare zone is caused by animals that are foraging near the clusters of chaparral shrubs. (This is supported by a bunch of those papers, specifically: Bartholomew 1970; Halligan 1974; Bradford 1976; Barbour et al. 2000.)

In this long list of articles, there’s a wonderful (and readable) one from Bay Nature magazine titled「A Landscape Shaped by Fear on Mount Diablo.」In it, the author writes,

Muller’s work was later challenged by researchers who argued that his work glossed over the role of hungry seed and plant eaters.「In California, the chaparral and coastal sage shrubs form excellent cover for rodents, rabbits, and birds,」Stanford graduate student Bruce Bartholomew wrote in a seminal 1970 paper.

These small animals leave the shelter of chaparral in search of food. But they don’t go far, lest they themselves become a meal for hawks, bobcats, mountain lions, coyotes and other predators. That’s why the bare zone is also called the「scurry zone.」

Where Bartholomew set up cages excluding small animals, the bare zone largely disappeared. That and followup experiments led to the view held by many field biologists today, that wary little animals play a huge role in keeping chaparral-grassland borders free of vegetation. In their view, the bare zone is not so much a strip of dirt poisoned by plant chemicals, it’s a landscape shaped by fear.7

The article is well worth a read. In it, you meet University of California at Berkeley botanist Lindsey Hendricks-Franco and get a great picture of the exclosures that she’s set up to test her hypothesis that small animal herbivory at the margins of brush zones in the chaparral causes bare zones there.

Of course, not being satisfied with what I’d read, I decided to go back out to my local chaparral and do a few of my own observations. Here are two photos that are pretty suggestive of what’s going on (figures 15.5 and 15.6).

In figure 15.5, you see a bare zone next to a large stand of coyote bush. So far as I know, there hasn’t been any report of allelopathy for coyote bush. If that’s true, what’s causing the bare zone next to it? Probably the small animals that live within.

Meanwhile, just down the trail I saw a bunch of grass growing right next to a small patch of chamise. If it was truly allelopathic, why would the grass be growing there (figure 15.6)?

Note that the stand of chamise is pretty small. I noticed that small patches of chamise OR coyote bush don’t have bare zones, while large patches of chamise OR coyote brush do have them.

I speculate that a smallish stand-alone chamise bush just can’t provide the cover that large patches can. That’s why small bushes don’t have a bare zone; if you’re a mouse, there’s no protection. But a big stand of any kind of chaparral brush will do: chamise, coyote bush, or even manzanita (another common California chaparral bush).

The Google Earth photo (figure 15.7, from March 2013) shows this gap effect quite clearly. Each of these clumps of bushes (some are chamise, and some are coyote brush) has a small zone around it that clearly shows either the allelopathic effects of chamise or the herb-grazing effects of small mammals near the bushes. (Note also the change in the color of the soil near the bottom of the image; it really does change to a light color down there. I checked it out in person. This isn’t an artifact; it’s really a color shift of the soil.)

And if you look at many of the clumps of bushes, you can see a pretty clear effect of the presence (or absence) of a bare zone depending on the size of the clump of bushes (figure 15.8).

Once the clump gets below a certain size, the bare zone seems to disappear.

After all this online research, I decided to go check out the truth on the ground. A few weeks later I went back up to the place where I took those pictures above. This place is Black Mountain (latitude/longitude 37.319795, −122.163153), a mixed oak woodland, chaparral, and grassland in the Santa Cruz mountains, just west of Silicon Valley in California.

In figure 15.9, we have an overview of the same region we saw before, just zoomed out a bit to show more of the land around the clumps of brush.

I had speculated that small bushes couldn’t provide enough cover for small critters to live in (and therefore wouldn’t have a barren zone around them).

Bare zones seem to vary by bush clump size (and not by what kind of bush it is). These clumps are all taken from the area just to the north of the satellite photo shown above. The three on the right, being fairly small, show no bare zone.

I went up there to check. Here are a few images from my walk there.

I went to this brush complex (location number 1 in the map in figure 15.19, in a spot just off the trail) and took a close-up photo, pointing my camera in the direction of the arrow (and standing at the tip of the red arrow at latitude 37.318673, longitude −122.157772). This is around fifty-six square meters in size and just about the smallest brush complex that I could find with a clear barren zone (figure 15.10).

You can see the barren zone here in the close-up (figure 15.11), while in the satellite photo, it’s only visible on the far side of the brush complex. What’s interesting here is that the barren zone is hidden in shadows (in the satellite image), but obviously visible at the time of day when I took this picture.

Here’s another image (figure 15.12), taken just off another giant brush complex not far away. Look carefully at the image. You can see this one is large enough to have trees (the dark spots) growing in the center. (This is brush complex number 2 in the map in figure 15.19.)

As you can see in figure 15.13, I laid out a tape measure so that you can see the width of the barren zone (just over thirty-nine inches or one meter). This zone is so wide that it’s also used as a deer trail (with lots of hoofprints making a clear deer path here). For some of these barren zones, it seems that there’s more than just herbivory by small mammals going on, at least in the larger brush complexes.

This close-up (figure 15.14) was taken on the west side of the large brush complex. Given the mature size of the brush (a mix of coyote brush chamise and even a few small oak trees in the middle), I’m not surprised that this brush complex shelters more than just rabbits and ground squirrels (figure 15.15).

And another photo—this time a smaller complex. Brush complex number 3, shown in figure 15.16, is around eighty-one square meters.

In figure 15.17, you can see that the barren zone is a little smaller than those of other complexes. This leads me to wonder if the width of the barren zone depends on the area of the brush complex.

After looking at a LOT of brush complexes, I noticed that at some point, the brush complex gets too small to even shelter small mammals, and as a consequence, do NOT have any barren zones, as in figure 15.18.

Here’s an overview of all five clumps of brush (figure 15.19).

Looking through all the documents that we found, one of them—the Point Reyes National Seashore and North District of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Fire Management Plan: Environmental Impact Statement (2004)—leads directly to the「animals in the bush are causing the bare zone」interpretation. The document notes that「shrub cover subsequently increases numbers of rabbits and small mammals (and birds too) that reduce herbaceous vegetation and favor shrub development. Thus, well-established coyote brush stands generally have depauperate understories.」

(You have to look up「depauperate.」I did. It means an ecosystem that’s lacking in numbers of species, or a kind of ecology that isn’t diverse.)

But it’s natural to seize on the allelopathic effect for chamise, probably because that’s the first explanation that pops to the front when you do the obvious search. As you read carefully, however, you’ll see that this might be true only for chamise, and doesn’t hold for coyote brush and other plants in the area.

I suspect that what ALSO happened is a kind of natural reaction when you’re searching; we saw the first explanation (allelopathy) and think「that must be it.」But as a good researcher, you have to resist that temptation. Just because you saw it first doesn’t mean anything. The biggest problem with finding something that seems to fit your data is that you tend to see everything else through that lens; everything you see afterward seems to agree with that initial finding.

If that happens to you, then it’s an example of confirmation bias at work. This is the tendency (when doing research) to confirm what you already believe, latching on to a plausible explanation and then searching for reinforcing evidence, rather than looking for something that might dispute the claim.

Research Lessons

1. Be careful about confirmation bias! It’s easy to search for information on a topic and find articles that tell you—that is, confirm—what you ready know. Be careful and look for a different point of view. In particular, I recommend that you …

2. Look for another explanation, or at least another point of view. In this case, it turned out that allelopathy IS a real thing, but it’s probably not what’s going on here. I found the「animals cause the bare zone」story because I noticed that these articles were all a few years old. So I looked around a bit more and discovered rather-different explanations for what was going on.

3. It’s a good idea to find a recent reference to see if the current belief is the same as older beliefs. And in this case, they weren’t. Botanical thinking had changed since the first allelopathic explanations were written.

4. You can do a lot of research by using multiple sources to get different takes on the same underlying content. The big surprise was that so much of this initial work can be done through satellite photos. The barren zones (at least of the larger brush complexes) is quite visible on Google Maps or Google Earth.

5. Sometimes you still have to get out into the world to check. Of course, even after doing all the online research you can, there are times when you still need to go out into the field and validate, but I’m constantly impressed by how much early phase science can be done remotely. You can sit at home doing online search and discover entirely remarkable things.

My wanderings on Black Mountain aren’t really a substitute for a proper field study. To do real, proper, careful science, I’d have to do a lot of field measurements and careful tabulation of my findings.

But I have to say that I looked at a LOT of brush complexes up there (probably a hundred or so), and in NO case did I find a barren zone around a brush complex that was smaller than ten square meters. If the allelopathy hypothesis were correct, then you’d expect to see a tiny barren zone—but not nothing.
