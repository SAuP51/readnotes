3. Who are the people I found on my search? Should I believe their images and posts? What’s their background?

4. Are those images of insects on the wings of this fly?

5. Why do you believe whatever it is you believe about this?

6. How variable are these kinds of fly wing patterns?

5. The path of research is often twisty. Don’t panic; it’s always that way. While this chapter doesn’t take long to reach a conclusion, this is actually the result of about four hours of my time (spread over a couple of days). I haven’t shown you about all the dead ends—searches that didn’t work, or websites I visited that were clearly bogus. This is just the way real research works: you explore, take notes, and back up when things don’t work out. Sometimes you just have to be persistent, and that takes time. (And that’s another reason why I write down my research questions. It sometimes takes me a day or two to get back to my online research, and seeing the note beside my keyboard reminds me what I’m trying to figure out!)

How to Do It

A. Search in this book.

When you’re doing a search in Google Books, you’re usually looking for something that is in the text of the book.

Figure 13.6

The「search in this book」box lets you find a bit of text in the body of the book.

For instance, if you use Books.Google.com and open up one of the books we used above (Fruit Fly Genera South of the United States), you should see the image in figure 13.6.

This search-in-this-book box is a useful tool when you want to locate a piece of text in the body of the book. In our case, we wanted to find different patterns on the wings of fruit flies, so I just entered the text wings into the search box, clicked on「Go,」and found every mention of the word wings in the book. I scrolled down the list of hits and was able to see previews of the text surrounding the hit.

A few clicks later, and I had the illustration (and the information) that I needed.

Notice that a search for wing does not give the same results as for wings. Each word in the book is searched for separately. Unlike regular web search (which does synonym expansion), searching for text in Google Books is a search for exactly that word. (Which means that you should be sure your spelling is correct; it won’t fix it for you automatically!)

Likewise, because of copyright restrictions, not all the text of all the books is viewable. Sometimes when you do a「search in this book,」you’ll find a hit that will show the term you’re looking for, but not the page view. That part of the book is copyright protected and isn’t viewable. If you really need to read that part, you’ll have to buy the book or get it from a library. (Thank heavens for interlibrary loan!)

Try This Yourself

This chapter has been all about how to get to the bottom of a controversial topic, searching out and assessing different perspectives on it. It’s often difficult to have these kinds of discussions on topics that are current events; frequently, those are surrounded by heated debates in which emotions run high and hot.

But this is an important skill to have, so we want to find a topic that has a diversity of opinions (all of which might be hotly debated, but people holding differing positions are still willing to sit together at a table and talk over their interpretations).

One such topic that is at a bit of a remove from current affairs is the interpretation of archaeological sites. There are plenty of sites that are clearly important, yet are difficult to interpret. Some are better known than others. Callanish is well known, but some of the lesser-known sites in Britain make equally fascinating research topics and have just as contentious interpretations, such as the Ring of Brodgar, Chysauster Ancient Village, or Avebury. Who built these remarkable sites? Why did they spend so much time and energy building them?

Figure 13.7

Callanish has been an enduring source of mysteries for centuries. It’s one of a number of sites that are ripe for online research using maps, archives, books, and online resources.

14 What’s the Connection between「The Star-Spangled Banner」and the General Who Burned the White House? How to Search for Vaguely Remembered Connections between Ideas

Finding the connections that you only vaguely remember. Ways to explore a serendipitous discovery, and when to stop.

It was a glorious spring day in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the truth is that I was running, not whistling, through the graveyard on my afternoon run.

You might think that this is a tad disrespectful, jogging through the headstones, but I don’t think those who have passed on mind much, and besides, this was an older cemetery, the kind that families in the nineteenth century would visit on the weekends for picnics and recreational outings.1 We don’t do that much today, so I figured that a great use for a cemetery is to run on through and say a quick hello to the headstones.

As I ran, I unexpectedly saw a grave marker that made me stop—literally—dead in my tracks, midway through my run. It was the final resting place of a man whose name I’d seen before, but who I did not know had ended up in central Halifax, under the leafy green trees of the Old Burying Ground.

For me, the best thing that happens when you’re doing research is finding those unexpected connections that link things together. It’s a magical moment when two different things suddenly turn out to be connected. The thing that stopped me while running was seeing that kind of connection in the engraved name on the stone.

I had discovered the final resting place of someone I’d read about before, via a name I recognized. Suddenly, two wildly different threads of my reading collided and merged. This man was involved in an interesting part of history, with another different yet equally interesting man.

But as I stood in the cemetery, dripping sweat, all I could remember was that these two were sworn enemies, and there was some connection, which I could not remember.

Just a couple of weeks earlier, I had been on another run through Georgetown, that leafy, tony area of Washington, DC, that has a wonderful jogging path that goes alongside a canal paralleling the Potomac River. Just before I reached the Key Bridge, I jogged through a small park with a bust of Francis Scott Key (figure 14.1). I snapped a quick picture with my phone’s camera and kept running. (This happens a fair bit to me, and maybe to you: I use the camera on my phone to snap a quick picture as a way of reminding me of things I’ve seen and things I want to look up later.)

That evening I looked up a bit of the history of the park, learning that it is there, next to the (Francis Scott) Key Bridge over the Potomac, because this is where Key’s house was from about 1805 to 1830, and also discovering that this is where he lived when he wrote the poem that became the US national anthem.

As I read about the Key’s life, I was a bit surprised to learn that Key was actually stuck on a ship in the Baltimore harbor, watching, while the battle raged that he described in「O Say Can You See.」

He had gone out into the harbor with fellow lawyer John Stuart Skinner (and also the US–British prisoner exchange officer). They would visit the British commander to negotiate the release of William Beanes, a local doctor who had been taken as a prisoner of war a few days earlier. It turns out that Beanes had been detaining and jailing British troops that were looting farms in his area. He didn’t care for their looting, and not surprisingly, the British didn’t care for his jailing of their soldiers. The British military were adamant, and since they had more guns when they stopped by his home late at night, the military tossed him in the brig, holding him prisoner.

During that meeting aboard the British ship, the HMS Tonnant, I discovered that Key and Skinner were the guests of three British officers: Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane, Rear Admiral George Cockburn, and Major General Robert Ross—two naval officers and an army officer.

They negotiated over dinner for Beanes release, which they achieved. It was a refined negotiation, with wine.

After dinner, Key, Skinner, and Beanes, alas—sorry to say—were not allowed to return to land because they had learned the strength and position of the British units along with the British intent to attack Baltimore. Thus, Key and Beanes were detained, and unable to do anything but watch the bombarding of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore on the night of September 13, 1814. That must have been incredibly frustrating, but the experience led to the US national anthem as Key wondered at the survival of Fort McHenry and its flag, still flying in the dawn’s early light. The resistance of Baltimore’s Fort McHenry during the bombardment by the Royal Navy inspired Key to compose the poem「Defence of Fort M’Henry,」which later became the lyrics for「The Star-Spangled Banner.」

Yet it was that name—Robert Ross—that stopped me in Halifax. I recalled the name, but not exactly the connection (this was several weeks later, remember). Once again, I snapped a picture, and later was able to do a bit of research to reverse engineer my memory and figure out why finding Ross buried in Halifax was such a surprise. How did I know that name?

This moment of incomplete recognition in the Old Burying Ground led me to the following thought.

Research Question: Who was Robert Ross? Why do I half remember his name?

With the images I took, I could zoom in on the gravestone and make this transcription of the inscription on it (figure 14.2):

Here on the 20 of September, 1814, was committed to the Earth the body of Major General Robert Ross who, after having distinguished himself in all ranks as an Officer in Egypt, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, & America was killed at the commencement of an action which terminated in the defeat and rout of the Troops of the United States near Baltimore. On the 12th of September, 1814. At Rosstrevor, the seat of his Family in Ireland a monument more worthy of his Memory has been erected by Noblemen and Gentlemen and the officers of a Grateful Army which under his command attacked and dispersed the enemy at BLADENSBURG on the 26th of August 1814 AND on the same day victoriously entered Washington, the capital of the United States. In St. Paul’s Cathedral a monument has also been erected to his memory by his country.

That’s all interesting information, but why do I have a half recollection of his name roaming around in my brain?

One way to bring out a partial memory is to quickly scan a bunch of articles about the subject and see what strikes you as memorable. With luck, you’ll find something that tickles your memory and be able to recall the connection.

In this case, I did a quick search for [Major General Robert Ross] and brought up many articles on him, including an interesting observation that he is best known for the burning of Washington, which included the burning of the White House, Capitol, and Library of Congress on August 24, 1814. That’s certainly a reason why I might have particularly remembered his name. Not only did his name surface in connection with Key aboard the HMS Tonnant but he was also the major who led a successfully infamous attack on Washington, DC.

Figure 14.2

If you read the gravestone inscription carefully, you’ll see that he was buried here in Nova Scotia on September 20, 1814, less than one month after his forces destroyed the White House. Oddly, he was actually killed in action eight days earlier on September 12, 1814. (And the story goes, he was transported from near Baltimore, where he was killed, to Halifax in a barrel of rum.2 It was a busy summer for him.)

Scanning the search results, I also read that he was killed during the Battle of Baltimore at North Point, not far from Fort McHenry.

Reading that little bit of text made the connection for me: in my mind, Ross is associated with the burning of the White House, Battle of Baltimore, and assault on Fort McHenry, which led to「The Star-Spangled Banner」and hence Key. When I saw the mention of Fort McHenry, the name of Ross and the fort clicked together, and I remembered that this was the link.

Q: How can I find more about the connection between Ross and Key?

To search for this, I did the kind of search query you might do to find a connection between any two people, putting the two names side by side in a single query. Here I’ve put both names in double quotes to search for each name separately (I don’t want to find out anything about someone named「Key Robert」):

[「Francis Scott Key」「Robert Ross」]

This leads to a bunch of content, including several books about the War of 1812. Here’s one descriptive passage:

It was aboard the Tonnant that the Americans Colonel John Stuart Skinner and Francis Scott Key dined with Vice Admiral Cochrane, Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, and Major General Robert Ross, where they negotiated the release of a prisoner, Dr. William Beanes. After his release, Skinner, Key, and Beanes were allowed to return to their own sloop but were not allowed to return to Baltimore because they had become familiar with the strength and position of the British units and knew of the British intent to attack Baltimore. As a result, Key witnessed the bombarding of Fort McHenry and was inspired to write a poem called「The Defense of Fort McHenry,」later named「The Star-Bangled Banner.」3

If you read the preceding quote, you’d (naturally) assume that these gentlemen had dinner, and then Skinner, Key, and Beanes went back to their sloop to watch the bombardment of Fort McHenry.

But that would be wrong!

I was a bit curious about the Battle of Fort McHenry, so I did a search to get a bit more background:

[Battle of Fort McHenry]

In these results, I find that the battle (that is, the all-day-all-night bombardment of the fort from the British ships) happened on September 13–14 starting at 6:00 a.m.

But wait a second! Wasn’t Ross killed on September 12? (That’s what his gravestone says, and that’s what all his biographies say!) How is it possible that he died on September 12? Wasn’t that the day that Key and Ross had dinner together?

To answer this question, I needed more details, which led me to search in Google Books using that same query [「Francis Scott Key」「Robert Ross」] that we used before, looking for books that would tell the story in a bit more detail. That is, I was hoping for a book that would give a detailed chronology of the last few days of Ross’s life. This time I checked a few more books before I found what I needed.

In one of those books, What So Proudly We Hailed: Francis Scott Key, a Life by Marc Leepson, I searched inside the book textA and found that this fabled dinner took place on September 7, at the mouth of the Potomac River, which isn’t exactly near Fort McHenry. That’s a bit of a surprise as it’s neither the date nor place I expected based on what I’d read so far.

In Leepson’s book, we find that

the three Americans were first escorted to the British frigate Surprize, under the command of Admiral Cochrane’s son, Sir Thomas Cochrane. On September 10, Key, Skinner, and Beanes were allowed to return to the President [their boat], accompanied by British marine guards. The Surprize [the British boat] towed them into Baltimore Harbor, about eight miles from Fort McHenry, behind the fifty-ship British fleet, where they dropped anchor. They spent the next four days there.4

Basically, they were waiting for the attack on Baltimore to finish up so they could go home. The British really wanted to take Baltimore, which they referred to as a「nest of pirates」because of the strategic location of the Baltimore harbor, and the number of Baltimore clippers (a kind of fast ship that the Americans used) along with their tendency to raid, seize, and sink British ships while on the high seas.

In the meantime, in the early morning of September 12, Ross led his expeditionary force onshore at North Point, trying to run around the flank of the Americans that were dug in all around the city.

There, about seven miles south of the city, he was killed by an American bullet just after he rode to the front to monitor the skirmish.

As this map shows, while all this was going on, Key was anchored a few miles offshore with a great view of Fort McHenry and its bombardment by Congreve rockets (「rockets red glare」) from the rocket ship HMS Erebus. Bomb ships HMS Devastation, Terror, Volcano, Aetna, and Meteor (「the bombs bursting in mid-air」) all shot their mortar shells toward the fort.

So while Key was stuck on the President in September 1814, he wrote out the poem「Defence of Fort M’Henry」with the melody of a popular drinking tune in mind (「To Anacreon in Heaven」).5 Over the next few years, it quickly became a popular patriotic song to sing, much as「God Bless America」is a popular patriotic song in our day. It wasn’t until 1931 that the US Congress made「The Star-Spangled Banner」the national anthem of the United States.

How to Find Serendipity While Avoiding the Rathole

Serendipity strikes when, in the process of looking for one thing, you find something else that’s a happy accident. It’s a bit like looking for a flashlight in the kitchen junk drawer and coming across a hundred dollar bill: you weren’t looking for it, but it’s a happy moment when you discover it.

Likewise, serendipity happens when you’re doing online research and stumble across something you really didn’t expect to find. But as Louis Pasteur once wrote,「Chance favors the prepared mind.」6 And in the case of research,「prepared」means that you actually know something about a topic—that is, you recognize a little something in the texts you’re reading that sticks out, even if only partly. In order for that to happen, you already have to know something about the topic. Serendipity doesn’t strike the mind that doesn’t know.

That was the case for the original question in this chapter; I’d been reading about Key but when I ran past that gravestone in Halifax, I partly recognized the name, which led me to this entire line of research.

So with a prepared mind, as I was finishing up my search for Ross and Key, I couldn’t help but note that Key had an extraordinary life. He was a fascinating man—a lawyer (who assisted in the conspiracy trial of Aaron Burr), poet, founder of two seminaries, and antiabolitionist who nevertheless freed his own slaves.7 In reading about his life, I ran across something else that piqued my interest. Strangely, his son, Philip Barton Key II, was shot and killed by a US congressman from New York in 1859. Earlier this year I’d been reading about the use of the insanity defense in murder cases, and once again, something in this name made my inner ears perk up with interest.

Was there really a connection here? Amazing. How could I not find out more about this serendipitous discovery?

Rather than read about this salacious story as a footnote to the life of Francis Scott Key, I searched for his name directly: [Philip Barton Key] landing on his Wikipedia page.8 There I noticed a link at the top of the article:「For other people with the same name, see Philip Key (disambiguation).」

When you see this, pay attention, because it’s probably worth checking it out, as it means that there is more than one person with this name.

Figure 14.5

When you see a link on Wikipedia that says「(disambiguation),」you probably want to check it out. This means that there are multiple people with the same name who can be easily confused with each other.

Credit: Wikipedia

Clicking on this link told me that Key II was indeed the son of Francis Scott, and the great nephew of Philip Key, the US congressman from Maryland (1791–1792).

But I also found several other articles about Key II, all of which agreed that he was in fact murdered by Senator Daniel Sickles.

It turns out that Key II was having a rather-public affair with Sickles’s wife, Teresa.9 In a fit of jealous rage, Sickles shot Key II dead just outside his home, in Lafayette Park, right across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House! (And you thought today’s homicides were ridiculous.)

As I read more about Sickles’s life and his murder trial, I learned that he was acquitted because he was judged to be momentarily insane. This was the vague recollection in my memory that once again sent me down a research path.

A quick search for [Daniel Sickles reason of insanity] to confirm this shows that he was the first person to use the「murder by reason of insanity」defense in the United States. Remarkably enough, he was arrested and put into jail, but was allowed to receive visitors AND keep his sidearm—while in jail. (I guess security was a little more lax in those days.)

Figure 14.6

This search tells us all kind of things—about Sickles’s tendency to squire and gad about with a well-known prostitute on his arm.

Out of the wealth of content available online, the richness, complexity, and pure salaciousness of his story, learning about Sickles is probably best done by reading a fully researched book on his life. Perhaps the best book on Sickles’s amazing, checkered, and complicated life is Thomas Keneally’s American Scoundrel: The Life of the Notorious Civil War General Dan Sickles.10

After this rather-tawdry affair with the murder of Key II, trial, and acquittal by reason of insanity, Sickles went on to become a general in the Civil War. He was a general who fought, rather badly it seems, at Gettysburg, where he managed to get almost all his brigade killed by not following orders.

You could continue in this vein, learning about Sickles’s wife (who apparently spoke four languages), mistress (Fanny White, who he presented to Queen Victoria), or time in Spain (when he was rumored to be the paramour of the deposed queen). The stories are fascinating—and endless.

As it is with many things on the internet, you have to know when to quit. Although the Sickles, Key, and Ross interconnections and stories are intriguing, an important skill when doing online research is being able to stop. If you’re having fun and have the time, by all means, keep reading! But more often than not, there’s a time limit on how long you can spend following the trail of scandal and strangely compelling life stories.

And that’s why I write down my research questions. Even just jotting them down on a piece of paper gives you a bit of guidance. Once you’ve found the answers to those questions (that you DID write down, yes?), consider stopping your searches, lest you keep wandering around in the deeper recesses of the internets. As a positive side effect, when you’ve got the original research question written down in front of you, you tend to stay on topic. (Although staying on path sometimes comes with a little ping of recognition—oh, that’s what I’m searching for!)

Another trick I sometimes use is to set a timer using my online calendar and then pay attention when the time I allocated for doing the research is over.11 The trick here is to really stop when the timer goes off (or the calendar event pops up). I’ve found through hard experience that it’s too easy to just「do one more search」or read「just one more article.」

Research Lessons

1. I’ve said this before, but it constantly bears repeating: READ CAREFULLY! I have to admit that I misread those passages about the dinner between Key and the British when I was first looking into these historic folks. I initially jumped to the conclusion that the dinner was on the same night as the famous attack. It was only later (as I was writing out my notes) that I noticed that Ross actually died the day before the bombardment. That contradiction made me back up and reread the original material, looking for the details.

2. The more you know about a topic, the more likely it is that serendipity will help you out! Serendipity happens to those who know. If you’ve already read fairly widely on a topic, the likelihood that you’ll see something that’s useful to your research goes way up. In a sense, this is the rich-get-richer effect (aka the Matthew effect), except in terms of serendipity, it’s a case of「the more you know, the more you can learn.」12 A good heuristic to enhance serendipity is to read widely in the topics in which you want serendipity to happen.

3. Write down your questions to keep on focus. I often just scribble them in a notebook that I keep beside my keyboard. That way I’m always reminded of what I’m searching for; it keeps me oriented and on task. It’s simple, it’s dumb, and it completely works to keep me on point.

4. A useful trick to get to a deeper understanding is to write up a small essay that presents all your information. I’m 90 percent convinced that having to write something down (and have that write-up make sense) is a great method to making sure that all your ducks are in a row. If you’re being honest with yourself, you’ll pick up all KINDS of mistakes in your reasoning and data (such as when it seemed that Ross was killed before the date that I’d assumed was the day of their dinner!). The simplest, fastest way I know to write a short essay is to send an email to a friend who shares your interest. In my case, I bombard friends with emails that start out「I bet you didn’t know that …,」and then I write on and on about, for instance, finding Ross’s grave in Halifax and telling the rest of the story. The key thing is that in order to write that short essay (or email), you have to make sense of what you’ve found. You won’t just write gibberish to a friend (at least, I don’t recommend that), but you’ll see any gaps or inconsistencies in what you’ve discovered.

5. STOP when you run out of time or find the answer to your questions. Research can be like potato chips—you want to keep going. But keep your head up and pay attention to how you’re using your time. That’s why I often use a timer when I’m in a hurry; it prevents me from overrunning the amount of time that I have and makes me refocus on the task.

How to Do It

A. Search inside the book text.

Once you’ve found a book, you can search within the book for exactly the text you seek. In this case, I found the book What So Proudly We Hailed: Francis Scott Key, a Life, and wanted to find out what the author had written about that fateful dinner where Key, Beanes, and Skinner had dined. To do this, I found the book and then used the「Search in this book」search tool, handily located in the middle of the right-hand side of the book interface, just below the title.

Figure 14.7

When you’ve opened a book, you can search through its contents by entering your search terms in the box that has the text「Search in this book,」which lets you find specific words that are used in the text.

In this case, I did a「Search in this book」for [Surprize] since I had already read that this was the ship where they’d had dinner. I could have also searched for their names, but I thought that their names would appear everywhere throughout the book, while the ship’s name (with an unusual spelling) would appear only once in the text, just when and where they dined.

Try This Yourself

Everyone and everything seems to be connected these days. This is so true that the Wiki Game has sprung up to take playful advantage of this fact.13

But in online research tasks, the goal is usually to get to an understanding of the research question as rapidly as possible. The ongoing question for you, the researcher, is this: What should I do next? That is, should you modify the query, open up a new line of inquiry, try looking at some images, or just stop the research altogether.

I find some research questions so fascinating that I spend more time than I should reading around the topic. While that frequently provides useful context, if you’re on a deadline, you need to be efficient in your searching.

So when do you stop? Generally speaking, when you stop learning useful new information about your question. Practically speaking, that can be tricky.

Here are a few research questions that captured my imagination for longer than they should have. As you work on these, continuously think to yourself each time you do another query, Will this help get me to the goal? Will it help me answer my research question?

1. Heroes: Who was Tadeusz Kościuszko, and how is it possible that he became a national hero in four different countries? He must have an interesting life story to become so celebrated in so many places.

2. Studying climate change through artistic models: A large collection of undersea invertebrate animals created in the 1860s is being used to study the effects of climate change. Who made those models? Are they really accurate enough to be used for this kind of comparison study?

3. Desserts around the world: Open-ended questions are often the most difficult to manage, mostly because the question isn’t well defined. When you’re doing research on an interesting topic, watch out! You might well follow those fascinating threads of research for hours.

Recently I got lost (for several happy hours) in the topic of the most popular desserts in the world. I quickly realized that each country has its own list, but that there are lots of overlaps that I hadn’t expected. How, for instance, does a plant native to Brazil turn into a common dessert in India, Thailand, Congo, and the United States? Tapioca pudding is often considered a somewhat-bland dessert choice in the US Midwest. How did it get to be thought of as a modest dessert in that region?

As an alternative question to search, finding the connection between different desserts can be seductive. For instance, what’s the connection between the French mille-feuille and Middle Eastern baklava? (And who invented baklava anyway?)

15 What Causes the Barren Zones around Some Plants? How to Know When You Should Go Offline and Do Research in the Real World

Some of the brush in chaparral lands have an odd zone around them that lacks small plants. That’s strange. Why? A story about finding the answer from a number of different sources, some of which are scholarly, and why you should use them in your research too.

The biggest surprises are sometimes the ones that you don’t see at first. They’re the little things that slowly creep into your consciousness and make you wonder, Why is this so? It’s only after some time that you realize how big of a surprise it was. This is one of those retrospective surprises.

Not long ago on a beautiful summer morning, I went for a run up on Black Mountain, one of the local peaks in the Santa Cruz mountain range. It hovers over Silicon Valley, making up most of the western edge of the mountain range that turns Silicon Valley into a real valley. If you look carefully on the right side in figure 15.1, you can see the typical summertime wave of fog coming in from the Pacific Ocean. On typical summer evenings, that fog (aka「Karl,」as the locals affectionately call it) comes in from the sea to cover San Francisco. Luckily, Black Mountain is usually high enough that the fog comes around, not over, the peak.

When I was there, I noticed something that was a tiny yet odd effect. The mountain is part of an open-space preserve, so there are the usual trees, trails, wandering deer, and chaparral. In the chaparral, there is a lot of brush. Here are two pictures I took on that run of a strange phenomenon (figure 15.2).

What struck me about each of these pictures is that there’s a noticeable gap between the green plant and the grassland next to it. Oddly, this doesn’t happen ALL the time, but it does happen a lot.

Figure 15.1
