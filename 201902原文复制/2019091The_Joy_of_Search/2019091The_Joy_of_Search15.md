[1 acre in square meters]

There are 4046.86 square meters in an acre. If we divide 4046.86 by 300, we should get an estimate of the number of stoplight parrotfish per acre (according to Choat). This number is 13.5—a little higher than we estimated before, but not a ridiculous number.

Research Lessons

1. Sometimes research takes time. I admit it: this one took me a long time. I’m guessing I spent about ten hours researching this, and I learned a huge amount along the way. (Not just about the sex life of parrotfish, but about why it’s so difficult to estimate the total number of fish on the reef.)

But I figured out that each stoplight parrotfish generates around 0.6 pounds of sand per day (on average, middle depth of the reef).

2. Using the scholarly literature is easier than you think; use Google Scholar and Google Books to search it. To estimate all that data about parrotfish, I went back to the original papers (using Google Scholar and Google Books) to dig out the charts and original data.

3. Your local library is often a great friend. In some cases, it’s kind of a pain to get to the original source document. As you saw, I had to use my local library to get to the original paper by Thurman. But once I had it, the rest of the story unfolded easily.

4. Don’t let the big words scare you off. Reading this scholarly literature was sometimes slow going. I had to look up a lot of words. Acanthurids, scarids, and fork length were all new terms for me. You can’t let this kind of thing bog you down. You can always ask Google for definitions. (Just type [define fork length] into Google to discover that this is「the length of a fish measured from the most anterior part of the head to the deepest point of the notch in the tail fin.」That’s a handy trick to know when you’re wading through dense text.)

Overall, though, this is a nice example of what you might think of as pure sensemaking—that is, pulling together information from multiple resources and cross-checking them against each other, and then checking facts against each other until the whole thing「makes sense.」

In truth, I read much more than I’ve reported on here. I didn’t want to tell you that I actually read about ten papers, some of which were duds. But this is also deeply true of real research. The papers seemed good from the abstract, yet the reality was that they encoded the data in an unhelpful way or were about parrotfish on some other continent or the wrong kind of fish altogether. When you do research from scientific papers, you have to look at the full paper, and not just the abstract. You might see just what you want to see in the abstract, and miss something deeply important that’s mentioned in the details.

One of the traits of a great searcher is the ability to stick with it and persist in the search until you reach a satisfying result. And it is satisfying once you figure it all out!

This chapter has shown you how to explore some unexpected animal behaviors in the natural world by following clues in your online research.

One of the more surprising things I’ve seen while out hiking are gigantic swarms of ladybugs.

Can you find out why and where these clusters of ladybugs take place? How big can these clusters of ladybugs get?

Ladybugs sometimes cluster together in immense groups that cover rocks, trees, and benches—any place where they can be together over the winter.

Of course, one of the potential problems with grouping together in such vast quantities is that dire things can sometimes happen as well. Do swarms of ladybugs ever end up in the water or on the shores of lakes? How would that happen?

Start with what you’ve read here to do your research. I suspect you’ll quickly learn that there is more to the ladybug’s life that simply eating aphids from your rosebushes!

18 Did Perry Ever Visit the Island of Delos? How to Follow a Long Chain of References to the Ultimate Answer

A surprising nineteenth-century graffiti leads to a world of discovery. How to find original, archival documents, and make connections over time, space, and history.

The Greek island of Delos is a beautiful, remarkable place that’s full of classical history. It’s a stony, sun-washed, smallish island in the Cyclades chain, more or less dead center in the circle of the Aegean Sea, a hundred miles southeast of Athens as the seagull flies and about the same distance from the Turkish coast.

It is also one of the most important mythological, historical, and archaeological sites in Greece, with archaeological excavations that are gigantic, as befits the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. It was also the center of the Delian League and Delian Festivals, held every four years in a pan-Greek athletic competition that alternated with the somewhat more famous Olympic games.

When I visited the island, it was on a perfect fall day—with an endless blue sky, and deep-blue Aegean Sea. It was a day where you could easily imagine that the island was full of magic at the perfect intersection of land, water, and sky.

As the ferry approaches the short pier, you can see LOTS of temples and ancient buildings covering the hills as you come near the island. It is, you could say, thickly marbled with classical Greek ruins.

It’s really quite a place. As you can see in figure 18.2, nearly the entire island is one giant archaeological site. People have been coming this way for thousands of years, both for religious and commercial purposes. They’ve been building homes, offices, markets, theaters, and temples all that time.

Figure 18.1

As a consequence, Delos was a stopping off point for traders, priests, slavers, worshipers, and travelers of every kind, pausing there to sell, buy, barter, steal, or worship, as was each traveler’s particular bent.

But the island was attacked in 88 BCE by the Persian troops of Mithridates VI, an enemy of Rome, who killed nearly all the twenty thousand Romans on the island. Another attack came from pirates nineteen years later in 69 BCE, essentially wiping out the remainder, which knocked Delos out of action as an active trading island. By the end of the first century BCE, trade routes had changed to bypass Delos. Around this time the island became uninhabited and left as a place that the curious (and the occasional band of pirates) would visit.

When I visited in late summer 2016 (a couple thousand years after all the classical excitement), I toured the island with a guide, marveling at the ancient buildings, theaters, and temples.

Figure 18.2

The tour guide did what tour guides do: walking us all around—and then pointed to this graffitied statue base (figure 18.4), saying that it used to hold a tall statue of Apollo, which was carried away by pirates sometime in the sixteenth century, leaving behind only the base. This was remarkable. I believe that there was a giant statue there, but I also know that we don’t have any idea what it looked like.

But when I looked at the graffiti, I did a big double take. There was something so obvious and remarkable on that statue base that I couldn’t believe the guide didn’t say anything about this. Does it capture your eye as much as it did mine? In the center you can see that someone pecked out「Cap. M. C. Perry USN 1826」in the stone.

What’s remarkable about this graffiti by M. C. Perry? Is it really that M. C. Perry? What are the chances?

This is clearly graffiti from a while ago (fresh graffiti on marble looks much whiter and cleaner). If you look at the stone carefully, you can make out a number of different names and dates. A few that stand out are:

B. Cooper, Esq., USN, 1826

John A. Cook, USN

Cap. M. C. Perry, USN, 1826

That last name rang a bell for me. As I stood there in the brilliant Greek sunshine, I wondered if I remembered my global history correctly: Wasn’t he the commodore that forced Japan to reopen itself to trade in the 1850s after more than two hundred years of self-imposed isolation?

This practically dropped a curious question into my lap.

Research Question 1: Is it possible that our tour guide missed the most famous graffitied name on the island of Delos? Could this possibly be the same guy as the naval commodore? Could this graffiti be from that famous M. C. Perry?

Naturally, I started off by doing searches for all these graffitied names (Cooper, Cook, and Perry), each one at a time, but only M. C. Perry got many hits. It turned out that my memory served me well. M. C. Perry (full name: Matthew Calbraith Perry) was indeed an officer in the US Navy from 1809 to 1858.

Figure 18.4

Although our tour guide didn’t point it out, there is a historically interesting bit of graffiti here. M. C. Perry pecked his name out on this plinth in 1826.

The Wikipedia article about Perry tells us that「from 1826 to 1827 Perry acted as fleet captain for Commodore Rodgers. Perry returned to Charleston, South Carolina for shore duty in 1828.」From this we learn that he was a captain in 1826, but otherwise that’s a bit vague. It’s not clear where he was in 1826–1827. Where was the fleet in those years? Where was Perry?

My first search to answer this was for:

[「Matthew C Perry」Greece 1826]

If that hadn’t worked, I would have started varying his name, just as we learned to do in chapter 16, trying variants like「M. C. Perry」or「Matthew * Perry」—but I didn’t need to, as this query worked just fine.

The first hit was to an article from the official US Navy history archives that includes a biography of Perry and fairly extensive timeline. One entry in that relatively massive collection is this description of his service:

Sep. 1824—5 Aug. 1827—Served as Executive Officer, U.S.S. North Carolina, flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore Rodgers, engaged in protesting American commerce from Greek pirates. In 1825–26 participated in a visit to the headquarters of the Greek Revolutionists and in an interview with the Captain Pasha of the Turkish Fleet. Promoted to Master Commandant, 21 Mar. 1826.1

That’s pretty compelling. We now know that he was in the Aegean Sea during 1826. Looking a bit deeper in the SERP, I found the Robinson library article about Perry, where it is said that「he subsequently [after 1824] served as Executive Officer of the USS North Carolina, flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore Rodgers, which was engaged in protecting American commerce from Greek pirates. He [Perry] was promoted to Commander on March 21, 1826, and spent most of the next four years stateside.」2

Figure 18.5 is confirmation of the dates, the ship, his officer, and his promotion to commander. I’ve made real headway on the research question. Now let’s get a bit more detail here: Did the USS North Carolina (and Perry) make it to Delos in 1826?

To answer that question, we need to find some kind of book on the history of the USS North Carolina, or perhaps letters from men on board that tell us where they were on these dates in 1826.

I already had a big hint that this kind of thing existed when in the earlier searches, I read about the USS North Carolina in the Naval History and Heritage Center’s History of the USS North Carolina, and saw the following image.3

Figure 18.5 is the frontispiece of the USS North Carolina logbook from US Navy military history site. This is the log of the right ship, but it covers the wrong years: 1836–1837. In the case of Perry in the Aegean, I’m looking for 1826. Not being an expert in nineteenth-century sailing procedures, I hadn’t thought about searching for a logbook! But finding this logbook of the USS North Carolina tells me that there’s a chance we could find the logbook of the ship for 1826 in a library somewhere. Now can I find the logbook of the ship for 1826, and will it show that Perry was on Delos on the date that’s in the graffiti?

Figure 18.5

My new research goal is to find the actual logbook from the USS North Carolina from 1826—and if I find it, can I actually read it?

Research Question 2: Where is the logbook of the USS North Carolina for 1826?

I have no idea where the logbook might be, so my query was broad:

[「logbook」「USS North Carolina」]

And I found that the first result was from Google Books—the Guide to Non-Federal Archives and Manuscripts in the United States Relating to Africa: Alabama–New Mexico.4

That unwieldy title tells me that this book is a finding guide (sometimes also called a finding aid), which is an index to archives and manuscripts in other places. It’s not the books themselves but instead a kind of catalog of places where you can find these books in other libraries. In this case, it’s an index to the archives and manuscripts that are not owned by the federal government, and located in the states from A–N. This suggests there’s another finding guide for states from NY–W … and that there’s probably another couple of finding guides for federal archives and manuscripts. That’s a handy thing to remember for the next time that we’re looking for some archives. Sometimes the feds really do have the documents, and it’s worth remembering that the term finding guide is a useful thing to search for.

Figure 18.6

By looking in the Google Books copy of this finding guide, I ran across an intriguing entry on page 217 after doing the obvious search within the book for「USS North Carolina」and「logbook」(figure 18.6).

This is great! Not only do we now know that this logbook still exists somewhere; this finding guide can tell us where the logbook from 1826 is actually kept. Notice that this isn’t just the logbook but this archive also has a letterbook (that is,「fair copies」of letters written by the fleet commander, John Rodgers).5 With luck we’ll find a letter that mentions their visit to Delos, or at very least, we’ll find a logbook entry that talks about a stop at Delos.

Yet the digitized copy of the finding guide in Google Books is only in「partial view」—meaning that while the entire book is digitized, not all of it is available for viewing in the browser because of copyright restrictions. Rats. This means that while I know the logbook exists, I can’t read far enough in the online text to find out where! That’s fine, since I’m willing to switch to doing off-line research, but this means I’ve got a new research question to work on.

Research Question 3: Where is this finding guide?

I need to physically locate the finding guide so I can read the rest of page 217 and discover where the logbook is actually kept.

Luckily, that’s easy. I clicked on the「Find in a Library」button (on the left side of the Google Books page; see figure 18.7) to show me where copies of the finding guide are kept. Google Books has a deal with WorldCat (the worldwide aggregated catalogs of many thousands of libraries) that will let us locate this finding guide book wherever copies of it are kept.

Figure 18.7

After clicking on the「Find in a Library」link and entering my zip code to locate the nearest copy, to my delight I discovered that this finding guide is kept at a library just two miles from my house at Stanford University! It’s an amazing coincidence that the finding aid would be just a bike ride away. If I can get to the finding guide at Stanford, I’ll be able to look at the rest of the page to figure out where the logbook actually physically resides.

The next day I called up the Stanford library and asked if I could read page 217 of the Guide to Non-Federal Archives to … They were kind and said,「Sure, can you come tomorrow?」(And this, I quickly learned, is common practice among archives. Many are open to the interested public. You often don’t need a special membership.)

At the right time, I bicycled over to the library, went to the rare books room, and checked out the finding guide, turning carefully to page 217 to find that the logbook for 1826–1827 is kept in the Elutherian Library in Wilmington, Delaware. I did a quick search to see if any of its collection is digitized, but no luck; the Elutherian doesn’t seem to have much of its collection scanned and available online. On the other hand, I did discover that the Elutherian Library merged with the Hagley Museum and Library in 1984. I’m probably not going to ride my bike there, but on my next business trip to the East Coast, I might be able to swing a trip to visit the Hagley library to see the logbook and perhaps the letters file as well. Perhaps that will shed some light on Perry’s presence (or absence) on Delos.

As I was thinking about this, it occurred to me that it might be possible to find a record of the movements of Perry’s superior officer, Commodore Rodgers, of the Mediterranean fleet in 1826. (This relationship between Rodgers and Perry was a fact that I picked up while reading the Wikipedia entry about Perry. I learned that his commanding officer was Rodgers, who was quite a historical figure himself.)

To find out if Rodgers had ever visited Delos, I did this query in Google Books to search for a book with information about their visit:

[Navy John Rodgers Delos]

I was rewarded with a hit! In the book The Navy’s Godfather: John Rodgers by Eileen Lebow, I find this quote at the beginning of chapter 16.

By the middle of June, 1826, the squadron had reached Vourla near Smyrna, after a leisurely thirty-four day sail, the length of the sea, from Gibraltar with stops at Algiers, Tunis, Carthage and the islands of Milos, Paros, and Delos. The commodore spent four days at each island, digging among the broken columns and tombs, exploring what were once magnificent Greek structures, and collecting enough relics to fill ten wagons, including two altars from the temples of Diana and Apollo on Delos.6

Not only do we know that Commodore Rodgers and the USS North Carolina, which had Perry on board, visited Delos, but they specifically stopped at the temples of Diana and Apollo. (Recall that the graffiti was found on the base of the statue of Apollo … at his temple.) I’d say that Perry, the famous one, was not only there but also spent quite a bit of time etching his name into the pediment at the Temple of Apollo.

How can we find out more about Perry himself? I just tried the obvious (although rather broad) search for items about the US Navy in 1826:

[U S Navy 1826]

In the results (on the first page!) I found the Naval Register for 1826 (the register is the master list of all men in the US Navy), which includes entries for Rodgers, Cooper, Cook, and Perry.7 This is another confirmation that they were all on the same Mediterranean cruise serving under Rodgers and apparently「visited」the Temple of Apollo together as well. They were: John A. Cook, lieutenant on the Porpoise, which was sailing alongside the North Carolina; Thomas J. Manning, a midshipman on the Porpoise; Benjamin Cooper, a lieutenant on leave; and of course, M. C. Perry, who was (at the time) a master commandant on the North Carolina.

All I had to do now was make it to Delaware to visit the archives.

A few months later, on a chilly, gray, rainy day, I stepped off the train in Wilmington and hopped into a taxi to the Hagley library. It’s a few miles away from the train station, and the ride there was to a tony section of Wilmington—with large manicured lawns, leafy trees, gracious mansions, and lovely stone buildings set next to Brandywine Creek.

The archivists were kind, and once I’d given them the accession number from the finding aid, they set me up in a corner of their quiet reading room with two boxes of archival content from the USS North Carolina’s travels during 1826 and 1827. These boxes held the logbooks and letters.

I spent a couple hours reading through the logbook, and learning via the letters about what life was like on board a ship of the line in the Mediterranean in 1826. There are inventory lists, judicial actions, updates in letters from the United States, and endless notes about weather conditions and ship movements.8

As interesting as that was, my goal was to find out if the USS North Carolina actually visited Delos, and if so, on what days.

It took a while, but after reading for a bit, I was happy to find this page in the logbook, dated June 15, 1826, when the ship was「standing towards the south side of Delos」for several hours (figure 18.9).

Interestingly, I wasn’t able to find any other visits to the island in the logbook, let alone a visit of four days to Delos, Paros, or Milos. But it’s clear from this record that the USS North Carolina lingered for several hours on Delos, and the ship’s crew visited other nearby islands as well. There’s no comment about whether they were able to off-load「enough relics to fill ten wagons.」On the other hand, they were certainly there long enough for Cooper, Cook, and Perry to peck their names and dates into a marble plinth for me to find nearly two hundred years later.

But I didn’t yet have explicit confirmation that they went onto the island itself. How can I find something that makes it clear they went onshore?

Every researcher has a moment when the course of your investigation changes. In this case, one of the librarians at the Hagley said,「You know, in those days, many ships had more than one logbook. You might check around for another copy.」

It had never occurred to me that there might be another copy! As I said, I’m not an expert in nineteenth-century navy sailing ships or the peculiarities of the way that they kept their logs.

So going back online, I repeated my search from above:

[「logbook」「USS North Carolina」]

Figure 18.9

When I read further down in the results, I discovered at least two other libraries that have「logbooks」for the USS North Carolina. Really? I’d always thought that there was just one, so when I found the first result, I stopped, assuming that I’d discovered the logbook. But no, it turns out that there were often multiple logbooks, frequently written and maintained by different people on board.

The second logbook is in the archives of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It’s listed in that archive’s finding aid as accession number 03190-z (with the collection title North Carolina Logs, 1825–1827).9 Once again, it’s in the library, but also not digitized!

Luckily, I have a friend in Chapel Hill who was happy to run over to the library and investigate its copy of the logbook.10 Sure enough, its copy of the log contains the same information, although clearly written by someone else; it’s not an exact copy of the Hagley library logbook. There’s also no direct confirmation that sailors from the USS North Carolina actually went ashore.

Encouraged by this, I went on to find that the third logbook is at the Library of Congress in its archives, filed in the Rodgers Family Papers collection, 1740–1987.11 In retrospect this seems obvious enough, but at the time, this was a perfect example of a serendipitous discovery.

As luck would have it, I was planning a trip to Washington, DC, just a few days later. I contacted the library’s archive section and asked if it would be possible for me to see the collection. Once again, the archivists were gracious, and on another rainy day in May, I visited the great marble edifice of the library’s Madison Building, just down the street from the US Capitol.

Once I got my reader’s card, I asked for a box that contained the logbook and told the librarian at the desk about my quest. He nodded and asked me to fill in a requisition slip (in pencil because they don’t allow pens in the archive room). I did that, asking just for the archive box with the logbook. He looked at my slip and compared it to the online finding aid, commenting that「maybe you’d like to see the letters of John Rodgers as well. … I suspect you’ll find them interesting.」

I learned that when an archivist says something like that, you really should listen, so we ordered another three boxes of the collected letters and notes from the collection.

When the four boxes arrived at my desk, I realized that while this collection has been used before, so far as I could tell, none of it has ever been photographed or scanned for online research.

Naturally, I turned to the logbook to June 15, 1826, and found more or less the same information as I’d seen in the other logbooks. I now know that the language of the logbook is fairly formulaic; standard phrases abound, and I didn’t learn anything new from the third logbook.

On the other hand, the archivist’s suggestion let me look at these three boxes of missives from 190 years ago. Taking the archivist’s cue, I started reading the letters of Rodgers to his wife, Minerva, and her replies. In many ways, it’s like reading an email thread; there were both halves of the conversation—his letter, and then her response, back and forth over the years while he was sailing around the world.

Mostly this exchange is about the little things about life on board the ship or life with the children back in Washington, DC, where Minerva lived.

Finally, I found a letter from Rodgers that’s dated June 26, 1826. This is what I discovered on the bottom part of page 1 (figure 18.10).

Of all the professions I suppose you would think me the least qualified for that of an antiquarian, notwithstanding this I have at the three last named places employed from fifty to sixty men daily with pick axes and spades in search of antiques & if I have not found as many relicks I have at least opened as many tombs & exposed columns, capitols & friezes & for that lay hidden in the bowels of the earth as most of the antiquarians of the age—I have not as yet been so fortunate as to find anything that can be said to be universally very remarkable, although some no doubt that will be considered rare in our country—I have at this time onboard the NC [the USS North Carolina] as many relicks of one kind or another as would load ten waggons & among them number two white marble altars from the Temples of Apollo & Diana at Delos.

That seems pretty compelling evidence that Rodgers and Perry (his close friend and fellow officer) spent enough time at Delos to do a bit of work, plundering the island of its classical treasures and leaving behind a bit of graffiti marking their time on the island.
