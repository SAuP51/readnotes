Of course, now I’m curious about what this wreck looked like before it became an odd pile of metal sticking out of the water near San Francisco.

Research Question 2: Can I find a picture of the Garden City ferry that was taken BEFORE it turned into a watery ruin?

This task wasn’t that hard. I already knew what it was and its name:

[「Garden City」ferry]

Once you’ve done that search, you can switch your search mode to look in Google Images; you’ll find that there are quite a few images of the Garden City before it met its untimely end.

For instance, here’s an image I found of the Garden City steaming into the wharf at Oakland, not that far from where it ended up (around 1900).

As you can see, in its heyday, the Garden City ferry was in a world of horses, wagons, and early cars. It was truly from another era.

Another great resource to know about when searching for geographically based information is Wikimapia. It’s a privately owned, open-content, collaborative mapping project that’s not actually part of the Wikipedia world, but shares its philosophy in encouraging people to share their knowledge about pieces of the world that are then layered into its maps.

Armed with the latitude/longitude, you can look up Wikimapia’s annotation about the Garden City.2

From the Wikimapia site, I again saw that the wreckage was there because the docked ferry had burned at some time in the 1980s. Now how did THAT happen? That led to my next query:

[「Garden City」ferry burn]

With this query I found the PrivateNaturalist website, which tells its own story of searching for the Garden City, noting,「This rusting heap is the boilers and paddle-wheel hub of the old Southern Pacific Ferry Boat ‘Garden City.’ … [I]t burned to the waterline in the fire of 1983.」3

There’s another version of that same clue.「The fire of 1983.」

This kind of thing is just crying out for further investigation. It burned in 1983, in the straits, not far from town, so there must be some kind of contemporary account. How do I find that?

Research Question 3: Is there a newspaper article about how this wreck came to be?

At this point, I want to read something that was written at the time of the Garden City ferry, and in particular, about how it became a picturesque wreck just offshore. Now it’s time to turn to Google’s Newspaper Archives.

Figure 12.8

To use it, I went to News.Google.com/newspapers and redid my query there. This search leads to several articles in the news archives, all saying more or less the same thing. Fires, started by arsonists, destroyed large parts of the area and spread onto the old wooden ferry, burning it to the waterline next to the Eckley pier on Sunday, August 7, 1983.

The arsonist aspect of the 1983 fire was of interest to me so I searched papers to see if the person was caught. The fire chief’s son from the nearby town of Rodeo was responsible and pleaded guilty. He was sent for psychological testing. His father was to retire the next month.4

By doing a bit more digging in the newspaper archives (searching for news articles with the search query [arson ferry Port Costa 1983]), I found a news article from 1985 that indicates a local father turned in his son for the arson after admitting that he was the one responsible.5 That’s a difficult thing for any father to admit, perhaps especially one who is the local fire chief.

Now I’m curious about the history of the ferry and the role that it played in the transportation around San Francisco Bay before the bridges were built. That made me realize that I should also check Google Books for any mention of the Garden City ferry and found a few with this query:

[「Garden City」ferry]

It was a quick click to find Ferries of San Francisco Bay and then search in this book for「Garden Ferry.」6 There are four great photos of this formerly grand ferryboat on pages 27 and 28.

Another excellent book in the same search results page is Port Costa, which also tells the history of the ferry, with many images over the years, and with a detail saying that it was the「largest dance floor in Contra Costa county」in its day.7 There’s even a Christmas card from its time when the ferry was a fishing resort.

When you’re searching for historical information like this, you should remember that there are also often countywide historical societies that collect information (and photos). To extend my reach, I thought I’d look for a possible countywide library or archive that might have additional information. Since Port Costa is the closest town to the wreck of any size (and it’s pretty small), I did the obvious query:

[what county is Port Costa in]

Note that this gives us a name and a map (figure 12.9). Now that I know the county name, I can look for:

[Contra Costa historical society]

In this way, I find the Contra Costa Historical Society.8 It has an old-school site, but by using the built-in search tool, I was able to find many more photos of the ferry and get confirmation from a different (and local source) about the history of the ferry as well as how it came to be mired in the muck near the Eckley pier.

Another useful resource to remember is that many local city and county libraries have stashes of archival materials. The downside of these local archives is that they’re often NOT indexed or searchable online. This is another case when you just have to go there to get the information; it’s simply not online.

But where is there, exactly? How can you locate all the libraries in a region?

When I search for local libraries and archives, I generally use Google Maps. In this case, I did a search for:

[libraries in Contra Costa county]

I found all the county branches and city libraries. If you click on one of the drop pins, you’ll get more information about that library, including a link to its website, but also the phone number. Frequently, to figure out what they’ve got, you actually have to call and do a bit of off-line research. But at least you now know where all the potential archives are.

Figure 12.10

A search in Google Maps for [library in Contra Costa county] shows all the public libraries in the county. Doing a similar query with「historical society」or「museum」can find even more sites with useful archival materials.

Research Lessons

1. Zooming in on a map can sometimes reveal information that you can’t see at all levels. In this case, it basically gave me the answer instantly, but you have to know to zoom all the way in (and check each level—most easily done by using the + and − controls).

2. Switching the satellite view can reveal new information. In this case, we can see that the wreckage is accessible at low tide. (I’m tempted to go back during an extreme low tide just for photographic purposes!)

3. Using local place-names can help focus the search and find new information. In this case, Eckley is the name of the pier, but it WAS the name of the village where the Garden City was finally moored. Likewise, Port Costa is the closest「big」town (although nowadays, it has a population of around two hundred people), but it’s a longer-lasting place than Eckley, which no longer has any town left. BOTH place-names, though, help to find news articles and books with local information.

4. Local historical societies and libraries often have great local historical information. Here I used the「look for a county historical society」trick to locate a nearby cache of historical photos. Keep that in mind when you’re searching for this kind of information. Often, historical societies’ archival content is off-line or difficult to search. A phone call and real-life visit will frequently give you great results through the help of friendly librarians and archivists.

How to Do It

A. Extracting the EXIF data from the photo.

Almost all digital cameras capture some metadata and store it with the image. For JPG and TIFF files, this is called EXIF metadata. (For details, see the Wikipedia article on EXIF.)9 Settings like shutter speed, ISO speed, white balance, aperture setting, focal length, and location in latitude and longitude are all recorded and stored when the photo is taken.

For OUR purposes, it’s enough to know that EXIF almost always has all the information about the picture, and if it was taken on a smartphone, it will have the GPS data as well.

There are lots of tools for inspecting the metadata of an image. You can get some of the metadata by getting「more information」when you use the preview app to look at an image on the Mac. Viewing EXIF data in Windows is simple as well; just right-click on the photo and select「Properties.」You can also find lots of tools for reading the metadata. I did a search for [image metadata tool] and found several. But getting the EXIF data is fairly straightforward. Seek and ye shall find.

Try This Yourself

The world is literally covered in mysteries that you can uncover with a bit of research. There are certainly some near you, but if you’d like to spend a little time researching some fascinating mysteries, here’s one to try out on your own.

San Francisco has many venues for entertainment of all kinds, but perhaps one of the more interesting is this ruin that’s on the western shore of San Francisco near Seal Rocks. Using your online research skills, can you figure out what this set of ruins is and its history (figure 12.11)?

Caution: this particular place is so rich in history that you might end up spending far more time reading about it than you’d imagine. Once you determine what it is and read about it, look around for some images of the place before it fell into ruin.

Figure 12.11

What happened to make this intriguing ruin on the western edge of San Francisco? This used to be something spectacular. It’s at latitude 37.780148, −122.513849, and that long wall running north to south is 225 feet long (or 68.5 meters).

13 Do Flies Have the Pattern of a Spider on Their Wings? How to Check the Credibility of a Resource You’ve Found

Some fruit flies have a remarkable pattern on their wings. Is it the image of a spider? Maybe an ant? And how is such a thing possible?

As often happens while reading stories online, I find a slightly incredible story and wonder if it was true. This probably happens to you too; here’s what I do about it to satisfy my curiosity.

In this case, the slightly incredible story started with a tweet about how a small fly apparently had images of ants on its wings. The comment stream on the tweet wondered if it was an evolutionary master stroke, a divinely ordained pattern, or just randomness at work. This image was such a remarkable thing that I just had to go check it out and see for myself. This in turn led me to do a small investigation into flies, wings, spiders, and evolution. Here’s the story, which I hope will shed some light on the process I use for evaluating incredible stories, trying to find out if they’re believable or not. Here’s the original tweet by @ziyatong in November, 2013 (figure 13.1).

This tweet was startling, making me curious, and that led me to start thinking about what it was that caused this reaction. Is there a way to distill a research question here? My initial attempt included two research questions.

Research Question 1: Is this fly for real, or is this all some kind of strange hoax?

Research Question 2: Does this fly actually have the image of ants on its wings? (That is, are they supposed to look like ants?)

Figure 13.1

I started this research process with just the Latin name of the fly that the questioner wrote in the beginning of her tweet. Is that the right name for this fly?

[Goniurellia tridens]

It turns out that if you know it, the scientific name is often a really great place to start a search. It’s almost always an unambiguous name for an animal or plant, perfect for use as a search query.1

This search finds a lot of online content, including a blog post by evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne titled「Why Evolution Is True」that discusses this fly with the curious wings.2

The buzz about this image is that it’s strange and remarkable. How could a fly have evolved to have TWO images of other insects on its wings?

Just to be clear, I’m not making a statement here about evolution or even flies. (At least not yet.) This is a great example of things that cause you—when you read something or see an odd picture—to pull up and say,「Hey, wait a second. Let me look into that a bit more.」

You know what it’s like. You’re reading along and then something grabs your attention—in this case, the fly with images of other insects on its wings. My first reaction was that this is pretty amazing. But then my「critical response」kicked in. And this is probably the biggest lesson here:

Whenever something strikes you as especially remarkable, wacky, or surprising—whenever you say「huh!」—you probably ought to check out the story.

This is really the basis of all research. As Isaac Asimov purportedly said,「The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka’ but ‘That’s funny.’」3

And that’s the case here. If something stands out from the background, it’s because you’ve seen something that violates your expectations. It’s「funny.」Perhaps it’s a stroke of color in an oil painting that you didn’t expect or the strange appearance of an insect on the wing.

So when I saw this, my Spidey sense started tingling, and I (being a curious sort of fellow) did a little digging.

I first read the post on that blog carefully. I noted the scientific name of the fly (Goniurellia tridens), the photographer (Peter Roosenschoon), where the photo was taken (Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve), when (January 2010), and so on. I then followed the links back to the Dot Earth column in the New York Times and read that.4

Interestingly, since I first read the New York Times article, an update has been made. At the top, the article has a few new lines of text that link to another blog, Biodiversity in Focus.5 This blog is written by an entomology graduate student, Morgan D. Jackson, and as is the case with many graduate students, they’re often the people most informed about the latest insights in their field. In this instance, his blog article on this topic,「Ants, Spider, or Wishful Thinking,」is excellent, and offers a learned background in a story that’s well worth reading.6

But already, just in a few clicks, I’ve discovered that there’s a range of opinions about this tiny fly. I found the original article, the original article it cited, and then the modified blog post. What’s going on here? What should I be thinking about this?

This led me to the most basic questions about the authors.

Research Question 3: Who are these people? Should I believe their images and posts? What are their backgrounds?

The original tweet poster says that she got the image from Roosenschoon. It’s not hard to find evidence that Roosenschoon really did take this photo, and that he really does work at the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve; since his name is uncommon, a search like [Roosenschoon fly wings] finds his photos. Likewise, searches for his photos show us that he takes pictures of desert animals.

This kind of quick verification check is something I do nearly constantly. When I run across a name I don’t know, and if what that person is saying is important to the story, I’ll do a quick search for their name and the topic to see if they actually work in this field, or have written something else on this topic.

So next I checked out the author of the New York Times blog post (science writer Andrew C. Revkin) and Jackson (an entomology graduate student who studies flies). They both have writings, images, and publications that you can easily discover. They are who they say they are. They have skills and background knowledge that’s relevant to say smart things about the wing patterns of flies.

Now I can reframe my first question a little more precisely.

Research Question 4: Are those images of insects on the wings of this fly?

They certainly look insect-like, but as Jackson points out in his blog post, it might be just an accident of wing coloration patterns that look like insects to humans. You could really think of this as a Rorschach inkblot test; it could be a random pattern that looks like images of bugs on the wings. So I’d say no—at this point, I’m not convinced that they’re really supposed to be depicting bugs. But it’s easy to find many pictures of this fly, Goniurellia tridens, and see that the image hasn’t been edited. (Keep reading, though; sometimes things in the image that aren’t edited could be significant.)

Research Question 5: WHY do you believe whatever it is you believe about this?

I’m certainly struck by the depth and careful analysis of Jackson’s commentary on this. Yet being skeptical myself, I went and looked up some original source material.

I know that animals within a family often share many characteristics. So I did a search on the family name of the fly, Tephritidae, in Google Books and found more than a few entomology books that mention this family name. Here’s one I discovered that was pretty interesting in an insectoid way: Fruit Fly Genera South of the United States (Diptera: Tephritidae) by Richard Herbert Foote.7 That’s an unwieldy title for a book, but a quick look inside tells me that this is a deeply serious work by an academic author for academic readers.

Yes, this is a book about related flies from the New World while the fly was found in the Old World, but the family and even genus is the same, and so I poked around a bit in this book and found the wings from closely related fruit flies. I just searched in the text of the book for [wings] (by using the「search in this book」A function) and found a perfect illustration that compares different wing patterns from a variety of fruit flies (figure 13.2).

And just for grins, I extracted the wing image from the picture above and put it side by side with the wing of the fly in the top picture. I converted it to gray scale so it would look pretty similar to these other pictures and then erased a bunch of the peripheral clutter. Here’s the end result, with the other image side by side for comparison (figure 13.3).

As you can see, these look pretty similar; not quite exactly the same, yet fairly close. I’m not sure how variable these wing patterns are, but this definitely seems like it’s within the normal range of variation. Now that I’ve noticed this variation, it inevitably leads to my next research question.

Research Question 6: How variable are these kinds of fly wing patterns?

To be clear, what I’m trying to figure out is if all these fruit flies have patterns on their wings, and if so, how different would the patterns be from each other? If they all have patterns, and they all vary quite a bit, this would suggest that the wing patterns are built in and not necessarily an image of another insect.

Figure 13.2

My query to figure this out was:

[Goniurellia wing patterns]

And I clicked on the images that were offered. In there, I found that not only do many of the species variations of Goniurellia have patterns on their wings but the patterns also vary quite a bit (figure 13.4)! Along the way, I serendipitously discovered that there are several other kinds of flies (including flies that live in the United States and United Kingdom) that are called「picture wing flies」simply because they have transparent wings, with「pictures」on them, rather like our Goniurellia.

Now that I’ve learned about picture wing flies, the inevitable next query is:

[picture wing flies]

Here I learn that picture wing flies are nearly always fruit flies (like our Goniurellia), and that there is a huge variety in the different patterns (pictures) that can be seen on the wing.

More to the point, one of the results from this search is a paper in the science journal Nature that tells us the images on a fruit fly wing are determined by variations within a single gene. All these variations in the wing pattern involve the repeated use of coloration that is already built in to the wing (figure 13.5).

It IS remarkable to see these patterns that look like insects on the wings of other insects, but perhaps more in the same way that a cloth can be said to have an image of Christ on it. (I’m not making this up; this happens often enough that there’s even a word for such things: veronicas.)

Figure 13.5

I think we’ve established that these wing patterns are real, and that there are an awful lot of patterns on fly wings all around the world. But are they supposed to look like ants or spiders?

Perhaps more to the point, is this remarkable fly even doing something that’s normal? In his blog post, entomologist Jackson points out that

if you look closely at the photo you can see that the middle and hind legs are actually curled up under the body and the fore legs are not resting in a natural position at all—they look more like a ballerina en pointe, with the last leg segments curled and with the tops of the「feet」(the tarsomeres) resting on the surface of the substrate—which leads me to believe the fly in the photo may be dead, or at least heavily compromised, and not actively displaying its wings at all!8

In any case, in a dispute among experts, as is the situation here, the entomologist is going to win. This is his area of expertise, his argument is well reasoned, and he gives a good bit of background information about mimicry in other animals and goes on to discuss the role of functional mimicry (as opposed to accidental imitation) that we humans perceive as being a mimic. He also brings up a significant question about something that I hadn’t even noticed: Is this fly even alive? Or is it in some strange altered state? The fact that an entomologist is questioning this (who not only knows what the fly is supposed to look like but also knows the specific word for the fly leg segment that makes up the foot of the fly) leads me to think that he knows what he’s talking about. Sometimes estimating the credibility of an author on a given topic rests on estimating how much knowledge they demonstrate about the topic area. Knowing about the normal standing posture of a fruit fly suggests that this person knows their stuff.

But there’s more to this ability to tell when a source is credible or not. Part of understanding what it means to find a credible resource relies on knowing something about that source as a producer of reliable content.

The fact that the New York Times posts updates to its science columns with information that amplifies and somewhat contradicts its original posting, AND that it didn’t modify the original article to make it seem like the authors knew what they were doing all along, are good signs. They suggest to me that the New York Times science writers are being truthful, honest, and open in their disclosures about what they knew, and when they learned it. Another hallmark of credible writing is the willingness to admit to errors in earlier work. Everyone makes errors, but here they own up to them in public! They then make their corrections easy to find. What’s more, when they correct a web article, they clearly make a note of it with「Correction」in the title of the newly edited piece.

Likewise, Jackson says in his blog that there are multiple possible explanations for why this particular pattern evolved. It could be this, or it could be that. Generally speaking (and especially about evolution), leaving the door open to alternate explanations is a good idea—and also makes me trust the scientist more.

Research Lessons

1. When something odd, peculiar, or funny strikes you (and of course, especially when it’s central to something that you’re trying to understand), it’s worth doing just one more query to see if the odd or surprising thing holds up to a little scrutiny. I advocate making this part of your daily inquiry practice; check out one「fact」a day. You’ll be surprised at what holds up, and what doesn’t. Just one more search to check; it’s not much to ask.

2. Take note of how reliable, consistent, and credible your sources are. Sites that use inflammatory language usually have a position they’re advocating; you don’t need to ignore them, but you DO need to understand what their slant is going to be. And when you find high-quality credible sites, remember them. You’ll come back to them in the future, and knowing which sites are reliable will improve your ability to triangulate between information sources.

3. It’s a good sign when publications admit their errors. Be skeptical of sources that never admit to a mistake. Even the most careful scientists make mistakes and have to do an embarrassing public recantation. That’s why I tend to believe the New York Times more often than not, and why I tend to believe other publications that clearly mark their errors in updates.

4. One research question leads to another. Here are the changes in my research questions just during this one investigation.Frequently, as I do online research (or as I watch expert researchers doing their work), the research question changes quite a bit from the beginning until the end. In this chapter, we saw the research question change from the open-ended one,「Is this fly for real?」to a more precise,「How variable are these kinds of fly wing patterns?」At each step along the way as I learned more and more about fruit fly wing patterns, I was able to refine the original question to be a little more exacting. Along the way I asked subquestions (「Who are the people I found on my search?」to determine if I could trust their writings) and even more general questions (I asked about whether they were「ants on wings」in the second question, but generalized it to「insects on wings」in the fourth). But each change in the research question was driven by what I’d discovered as a result of the previous searches. As you learn, you change your level of understanding as well as your questions. (Which is why I jot down what my research question is, just so I can keep track!) 1. Is this fly for real, or is this all some kind of strange hoax?

2. Does this fly actually have an image of ants on its wings?
