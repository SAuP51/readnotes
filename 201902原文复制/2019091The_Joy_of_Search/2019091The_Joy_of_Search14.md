Clearly, the history is a bit tangled here.

Research Lessons

There are a few lessons.

1. Check your web answers! As you can see, various sources give variations on a theme. As I always say, double source (or more!) your answers. Get your information from places you can trust.

2. Remember that you can always ask a real expert. In this case, Munro was a fantastic resource; she’s a world expert on the Tongva language, but was gracious in giving me an answer to a fairly technical question. People are generous, as a rule. Reach out to them.

3. Be sure you understand the question. In the Zaire capital question, the answer took some digging to get to the bottom of the issue. It really was NOT obvious what the answer was and took some thinking about what a possible answer would be. Answering the Zaire question also meant that we had to realize that the question had a built-in assumption—that is, that Zaire was a currently existing country. You should check your web answers, but also be sure to check your assumptions.

4. Sometimes questions take a while to answer. To this day (late 2018), I’m still looking for the Cabrillo map with Yang-na on it. (Or something similar.) It may take a while, but you never know; I’m constantly on the lookout.

5. Know what a gazetteer and dictionary of place-names can do for you. Part of being a great online researcher is knowing that certain kinds of resources exist. Just as you should know that a collection of maps is an atlas, it’s worth knowing that gazetteers and place-name dictionaries exist. Not only do they pull together a particular kind of information, but they often have high-quality, credible information on related places and topics that will prove useful.13

6. Get context around what you find! Can you answer those little questions, such as where, when, and how? What other relevant things were going on at the time? Who are other players in that time and place? Reading a Wikipedia article is often a great way to get started in picking up the context around a topic, but consider other contextualizing sources as well (overview articles, summaries of a topic, etc.).

Bear in mind that what I’m showing you here is what’s true NOW. As more books and articles are published on the origins of these places, the stories could—and most likely will—change.

How to Do It

A. Search by image.

Suppose you have an image of something—a building, logo, or distinctive kind of leaf. You can search for that image over all the images that Google knows about.

As an example, here’s an image of a beautiful leaf that I found on the ground last fall.

I opened up a Google Images search (you can use the URL Images.Google.com).

Figure 16.7

I took a photo of the leaf in question on a plain background. (You don’t always need a blank background, but for leaves, it’s best to have it in isolation.)

A Google Images search can accept other images as input. You can drag an image from your desktop onto the search bar, or click on the camera icon to give it a URL or upload an image.

When you see the camera icon in the image search, you can click on it and upload an image (like the leaf image above), which then does a search for that image, giving results with images that are near matches. In this case, we discover that this leaf is from a ginkgo tree (aka Maidenhair tree; see figure 16.9).

Notice that the name of the image file (MysteriousLeaf.jpg) is shown in the search bar (highlighted in blue) next to「maidenhair tree,」which is Google’s best guess at what the most plausible textual query for this might be.

Try This Yourself

Not only do people and places change their names, but they change their identities, sometimes significantly. Austria, for instance, was the basis for the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867 until 1918. Its border has changed more than once or twice in the past three hundred years. This kind of shape-shifting is frequently accompanied by name shifting as well.

As an example, can you work out the multiple names, shapes, and sizes of the country currently known as Tanzania? It’s in the southeast of Africa, in a place often called the Swahili Coast.

What resources would you need to use to find out the historical changes? (Remember that sometimes the least likely resources can prove useful!)

17 The Mystery of the Parrotfish, or Where Does That White Sand Really Come From? How to Triangulate Multiple Sources to Find a Definitive Answer

I mean, is that beautiful sandy Caribbean beach really something less savory? How to find out where sand comes from by using online research methods and triangulating across multiple information sources. You’ll find out something deeply surprising.

It’s the beginning of September, and it’s just about the perfect day. I’m spending a few days on the small Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire, scuba diving in the gentle waters just off Kralendijk. It’s like I’m living in one of those PBS adventure TV specials—the water is 82 degrees and ultraclear, and full-of-life seas surround the island.

When you scuba dive in the Caribbean, you’re constantly seeing things that you don’t know, and consequently, spending a fair bit of time searching for answers to「What kind of fish was that?」or「What IS that strange thing we found that looks like a snake, but has gills?」This happens pretty much every time you go underwater, and for curious people, it’s a place of endless entertainment.

This is a fish you see everywhere around Bonaire (and most of the Caribbean as well). I shot this picture in the afternoon at a depth of 30 feet (or 10 meters). This fish is about 2 feet long (or 0.6 meters) from the tip of its tail to its nose. This is a typical pose as it swims on the reef. These creatures bump around the coral reefs, apparently biting the reef every minute or so, wandering from place to place. And if you watch one for more than a couple of minutes, you’ll see that in mid swim, it will suddenly excrete a long, fine cloud of what looks like white dust and tiny pebbles, streaming out into the clear water from someplace near the bottom of its belly.

Here’s the magical moment: a parrotfish swims by and a stream of sand comes from the bottom of the fish.

When I come up to the surface after watching this for a bit, I can’t help but wonder a couple of basic things.

Research Question 1: What kind of fish is this? What’s both the common name and Latin scientific name?

Research Question 2: What’s going on when this fish is excreting that cloud? (I’m wondering because it happens SO often. I never see any other kind of fish doing this. Is this fish odd somehow?) How much sand does this parrotfish poop in a day?

I started with the basics: What is this beast? I began by searching for:

[Caribbean fish guide]

Why this? Because I was hoping to find some kind of authoritative reference to the fish of the Caribbean and maybe pick up some language that would help me describe what kind of fish it is.

Figure 17.4

In the search results, I found Reefguide.org, which has a high-quality guide to the reef fish of the world.1 It has sections for tropical reef fish by location (Bahamas, Caribbean, South Pacific, etc.) and type (parrotfish, angelfish, goby, etc.).

From its home page, I chose「Caribbean, Bahamas, Florida」and then did a quick scan of the fish families. Just looking around tells you a lot; you learn both the range of different fish types and some of the language that’s used to describe a fish. It wasn’t a「small oval」fish or any of the others I saw, so I kept on looking (the web equivalent of turning pages) until I found the parrotfish category. Once you see the parrotfish page, it’s pretty clearly that kind of beast. The fish in my picture is a dead ringer for the one that’s in the top row, third from the left.

Just to double check that this is in fact the same animal, I did a regular Google search for its name:

[stoplight parrotfish]

That search confirmed that it really does look like this fish. I also picked up that this fish is called a Sparisoma viride by scientists. Knowing a technical term like this will come in handy later. Why? Because ordinary names like stoplight parrotfish too often refer to different fish in different places. But a Latin name like Sparisoma viride will only ever mean this one particular kind of fish (that’s the promise behind the biologist terminology).

Figure 17.5

A juvenile stoplight parrotfish looks different from the adult form. This is true for an amazing number of fish; they’re not just smaller versions of the adults but also colored and shaped rather differently.

I also found out, remarkably enough, that male parrotfish keep harems of females nearby. When the dominant male dies, one of the females will change gender and color, turning into the alpha male for the harem.

There’s also a striking difference in appearance between the adults and juveniles. Here’s a photo I took of a juvenile stoplight parrotfish.

I was really curious about the effects of all that excretion. You see this happening ALL the time. And of course, on the dive boats, you hear stories about how the parrotfish really are responsible for much of the sand you see on the beaches. I needed to learn something about the relationship between parrotfish and geology. I started with the parrotfish I knew about by doing a query like this:

[stoplight parrotfish sand]

The results, though, were too diffuse to be useful.2 I suspected that adding the word「stoplight」isn’t helping my search.

So I modified my query to be:

[parrotfish sand]

I quickly found many articles about the effect of parrotfish (in general, and not just the stoplight parrotfish) on sand creation in the Caribbean.

I soon learned from the Wikipedia article on parrotfish that they’ll bite into the coral, scraping off a bit with each bite.3 That’s what I saw them doing. They digest the algae they get in that bite, and then, after a bit of crunching and digestion, the coral bits are excreted into the water, making up a large amount of sand. In essence, much of the white sand on Caribbean island beaches is made up of fish poop! (OK, to make you feel better, it’s made up of the excreted, indigestible bits of pulverized coral.)

And in the popular magazine Newsweek, I find that some people believe that there can be anywhere between 840 pounds for a Hawaiian parrotfish and 11,000 pounds for some (unnamed) fish.4 The Newsweek article points to an article in the journal Marine Biology. (The March 2010 article is titled「Bioerosion of Coral Reefs by Two Hawaiian Parrotfishes: Species, Size Differences, and Fishery Implications,」which pretty clearly is relevant to our research question.)5

This kind of discrepancy comes up all the time, and it’s the reason that you don’t want to single source anything, even simple facts like this.

Just to triangulate what I was reading, I did the same search on Google Scholar to see a few scholarly papers on the topic.

I found a paper with what looked like a reasonably good title:「Rate of Bioerosion by Parrotfish in Barbados Marine Environments.」It points out that「stoplight parrotfish were observed to spend 80% of their time feeding on surfaces covered with filamentous algae and 20% on sand. Only Sparisoma viride consistently leaves well-defined scars on live coral.」6

But there’s a debate among different sources about how MUCH sand a parrotfish produces each year. If you look at the comments, some say it’s 1 ton (2,000 pounds) per year per fish, while others say it’s 200 pounds per year per fish. Since that’s SUCH a variance, we have to think about the rate of sand production per fish a bit more deeply. If sources vary by that much, something fishy is going on. (Pardon the pun.)

Figure 17.6

The crucial citation in the Wikipedia article links to a dead result. Looks like we’ll have to get the book and check manually.

So how MUCH sand does a single parrotfish create in a single year? And where do these numbers come from?

The source for the claim of 200 pounds of sand per fish seems to be from the Wikipedia article on parrotfish, which points to the article by Harold V. Thurman (see below for reference list).

Unfortunately, the link to the Thurman article specified in Wikipedia is dead (it was last checked in 2009), and the target site no longer supports this reference. I spent some time searching for this chapter, and while I can find lots of references to it, I can’t find the book chapter itself.

Even worse, many of the references to this chapter I found are clearly copies of the citation and link from Wikipedia. (Even at such well-respected sites as the Encyclopedia of Life, whose parrotfish page would be considered authoritative, merely quote the Thurman reference and give the same link to a dead page.)7 Sigh. Lesson learned here: references and links seem to rot a bit with time. Which is why you have to constantly check these things.

So I went to my local library’s website and interlibrary loan got me the darn thing.8 Amazingly enough, I got the book after only three days! And there, on page 310, is the assertion:「By eating coral (and corraline red algae) a single parrot fish may produce up to 90 kg (190 lbs) of sand per year.」9

Case closed? Not yet. Unfortunately and irritatingly, this book doesn’t give any reference for that bit of data. Where did it get that information from?

How about the other claim that each parrotfish produces 2,000 pounds per fish per year? The source for the 2,000 pounds seems to originate from the Ichthyology department’s page about parrotfish at the Florida Museum of Natural History.10

On that page, it says that「parrotfish may produce as much as one ton of coral sand per acre of reef each year.」

But read that carefully. This means「all of the parrotfish on the reef in 1 acre」are producing around 2,000 pounds of sand over the entire acre. That’s the contribution by all the parrotfish working (so to speak) together.

Sadly, it doesn’t give a reference for its source material either. So I search for the exact phrase as seen on the Florida Museum of Natural History site (here I use double quotes around the exact phrase to find exactly that phrase):

[「Parrotfish may produce as much as one ton of coral sand per acre of reef each year」]

It’s clear that all the references are using the museum’s page as their source. (Typically, much of the text in the article is quoted directly, including that phrase. This kind of thoughtless copying always makes me suspicious.)

By being diligent and following various sources, however, I also found the reference to 2,000 pounds as coming from the book Fishes of the Bahamas. The citation would look like this:

Bšhlke, J. E., and C. G. Chaplin. 1993. Fishes of the Bahamas and Adjacent Tropical Waters. Austin: University of Texas Press.

So I go to Google Books and find the book, but this citation is slightly wrong. The first author’s surname is Böhlke, not Bšhlke. (Some character encoding failed, and people weren’t careful about their citations. Sigh. This happens more often than you’d like. Part of your research skill is learning to read through and around such minor errors.)

And once again, this book falls into the「scanned on Google Books, but snippet-view only」(which doesn’t help as I can’t read the important bits). It’s not scanned on Amazon.com, Hathi Trust, or any of the other sources. So back to the library.

I ordered this book on interlibrary loan, and got it about one week later along with the Thurman book. The thing is, Fishes of the Bahamas is a giant tome: 771 pages of fish data. There’s not much plot in this book, but it’s still pretty interesting to read (that is, if you’re a diver and/or really love to read infinite details about every possible fish in the sea).

On the other hand, on page 465 of this magnificent tome I found the sentence,「On a Bermuda study reef it was recently estimated that one ton per acre per year of this material [「calcareous material,」i.e., coral sand] passes through the intestinal tracts of reef fishes and is redeposited as fine sand, and that the scarids [parrotfish] are primarily responsible.」

Figure 17.7

Here I just searched on Google Scholar for the title of the paper (which I copied and pasted from that other article.

And the reference (finally, a real reference!) given here is:

Bardach, J. E. 1961.「Transport of Calcareous Fragments by Reef Fishes.」Science 133 (3446): 98–99.

By going to Google Scholar and searching for that author plus the title, I was able to get to the original article,「Transport of Calcareous Fragments by Reef Fishes.」11

Now we’re getting somewhere. In that paper (published originally in the well-respected journal Science), the author writes,「It was found that browsing omnivorous reef fishes which rely, in part, on a plant diet ingested and redeposited at least 2300 kg of such material on a 1-hectare study reef near Bermuda.」I like that word choice:「redeposited.」The article means pooped out.

Let’s do some Google conversions to check this number.

To convert these numbers, you can do Google queries like this:

[2000 pounds per acre in kg per ha]12

This query asks Google,「What does 2,000 pounds per acre convert to in kilograms per hectare?」The answer is straightforward (and we don’t have to do the math): it’s 2241.7 kilograms per hectare (a hectare is 10,000 square meters, or just about the size of 2 football fields).

See how that works? Now you can use Google to convert the quantity given in the paper (2,300 kilograms redeposited on 1 hectare」) by doing a query like this:

[2300 kg per ha in pounds per acre]

It now tells us how many pounds per acre, which gives you the results of 2,052 pounds per acre. That’s pretty close to 1 ton.

I wanted to get the full text of the paper, but that’s twenty dollars for a「short-term use」(one-day) license. As you can imagine, that’s a little expensive for something that I’m not sure will be what I seek.

But we still don’t know how much sand per fish per year that represents. To figure this out we need to know, How many parrotfish live in on an acre of reef?

Hoping to figure out this subpuzzle, I started doing searches like this, using the scientific name of the stoplight parrotfish:

[「Sparisoma viride」sand OR sediment production]

This is reasonably productive (especially when done in Google Scholar) and leads to several papers on the topic. The most cited paper is:

Bruggemann, J. H., et al. 1996.「Bioerosion and Sediment Ingestion by the Caribbean Parrotfish Scarus vetula and Sparisoma viride: Implications of Fish Size, Feeding Mode and Habitat Use.」Oldendorf 134 (1): 59–71.13

I got a PDF of the paper by doing this search, using the filetype: operator to limit my search to ONLY PDF files:

[filetype:pdf「Bioerosion and sediment ingestion by the Caribbean parrotfish Scarus vetula and Sparisoma viride」]

That led me to the PDF file, which I printed out and carefully read.

This is when I realized that this is a much more complex problem than just looking up the number of parrotfish per square meter on the reef.

By reading this (and a few other papers), I learned that the density of parrotfish on the reef varies hugely by depth. (Shallow water has a lot; water deeper than 50 feet has fewer.) They also sleep at night, and feed only between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. (and by the way, they mate daily, between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. … but I digress). I also found out that the quantity of coral ingested when they bite varies a good deal by the size of the fish, but it varies even MORE depending on the kind of parrotfish.

Among other things, we HAVE to be careful not to mix up our parrotfish species (e.g, Hawaiian parrotfish with Caribbean parrotfish, or even parrotfish that live side by side in the waters of Bonaire); as the paper points out,「The erosion rates per bite by Sparisoma viride is more than an order of magnitude higher than in Scarus vetula.」That is, the stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) has a bite size that’s ten times larger than that of the Scarus vetula (queen parrotfish).

But we’re getting somewhere.

If you read this paper carefully, you’ll eventually find figure 5,「Scarus vetula and Sparisoma viride: Erosion rates per bite (upper graphs) and per day (lower graphs) as a function of fish size.」Figure 17.8 is a redrawn version of the relevant chart.

If you look at the graph in the lower-right corner, that’s a chart of how big those bites are. Although the grams per day vary greatly by fish size, the average is right around 300 grams per fish per day (marked by the dashed horizontal line). Basic math (which you can do by typing in this expression directly into Google) shows us that:

300 grams * 365 days = 109,500 grams per year

Or 109.5 kilograms per year (204 pounds), which is close enough (given all our averaging) to our earlier estimate of 95 kilograms per year. (And incidentally, it’s nothing close to 2,000 pounds per fish per year.)

If this is correct, then to get 2,000 pounds of sand contributed per acre by all the parrotfish, we’re going to need around 10 stoplight parrotfish per acre. By my direct observation on the reefs of Bonaire, that seems low, but let’s see if we can’t find some numbers in the literature.

Another paper I found from my previous query is this:

Choat, J. Howard, et al. 2003.「An Age-Based Demographic Analysis of the Caribbean Stoplight Parrotfish Sparisoma viride.」Marine Ecology Progress Series 246:265–277.14

He「conservatively estimates」that there are four individual parrotfish per plots of 300 square meters. OK, but how big is an acre in square meters? Another Google query handles that:

Figure 17.8

Comparison of the parrotfish Scarus vetula and Sparisoma viride erosion rates per bite (upper graphs) and per day (lower graphs) by fish size. Note the differences in the scales of the y-axis between the two upper graphs. Viride fish take much bigger bites than vetula! The bites are measured in milligrams per bite.
