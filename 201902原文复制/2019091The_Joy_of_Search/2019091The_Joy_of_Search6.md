5. Check your intuitions at the door when you do research. My intuitions about causes of death were embarrassingly bad. I wrote them down at the start of my research to make me understand what it was I was learning, and see the distance between where I started with my research and where I ended up. Although this is painful, seeing your mistaken intuitions in black and white is a strikingly powerful learning moment.

How to Do It

A. How to use the * operator.

In my above example, I used the query:

[「In 2015, a total of * resident deaths」]

Here the * is used as a kind of fill-in-the-blank operator. For this query, we’re looking for a number that fills in for the * in the query.

This is a handy Google search trick when you’re not sure of a word (or two) in a phrase that you’d like to find. Another use would be to find organizations when you can’t remember their name. For example, you might search for an organization that’s at a university, but is the Department of X Technology. You know you’ll recognize it, but you just can’t come up with the middle words. Use the * operator in a query like:

[「Department of * Technology」University]

Such a fill-in-the-blank query gives you the chance to see what kinds of possibilities there are.

B. Use the site: operator.

Truthfully, I probably use site: more than any other operator in my searches. It just restricts the search to a particular site, which is often exactly what I want to do. Above I used the query:

[site:CDC.GOV causes of death by age]

It allowed me to search for results with the words「causes of death by age」ONLY from the CDC’s CDC.GOV site. You can limit your searches to a particular online location (like site:CDC.GOV or site:Stanford.edu) or even particular countries with a query that specifies the country code (like [influenza site:UK] to search only sites within the United Kingdom.

Try This Yourself

It’s relatively easy to find data, but it’s sometimes hard to make sure you’ve got the right data. In particular, if you’re ever going to read the fine print on something, be sure to read the fine print on the metadata (that is, the information that describes the data set) before you do anything with it. Even simple research questions can contain surprising depths.

For instance, how would you find out the answer to the question, How many different breeds of dogs (or cats, depending on your personal preference) are there?

Knowing how to use the site: operator, you can look for the answer to that question by looking inside specific sites that you trust. When you do this search, read the details of the definitions carefully. What is the definition of a「breed」? (Is a cockadoodle a breed of dog? Is the Savannah cat really a domesticated cat?」)

As you search for the answers, think about why you trust a particular organization’s site. Is the American Kennel Club, for example, an organization that has a good definition of dog breed, and if so, why do you think so? Would you believe the German Kennel Club (VDH.de) more or less than the American Kennel Club (AKC.org)? So, how many breeds of dog are there? Do you trust the source you find? Why?

7 When Would You Want to Read the Italian Wikipedia? How to Look for Information from Other Languages in Wikipedia and Other Sources

Sometimes, looking for information in another language than yours can be immensely useful.

I was talking with a friend about the stories of Leonardo da Vinci, that great polymath of the Italian Renaissance. It seems there’s some debate about whether he was the greatest artist of all time, or merely a worthy competitor to Michelangelo and other contemporaries.

As we talked, the legacy discussion became a bit heated. How could one get a sense for the man some five hundred years later? Naturally, my thoughts turned to how I would do this piece of research online. It’s easy enough to find all kinds of online resources, but is there a way to get a sense of the legacy of a famous person? What would that even mean? I decided to capture my curiosity and write down my research question.

Research Question: How can you get a good sense for different cultural interpretations of an idea (in particular, for Leonardo and Michelangelo)? Is there a way to do this with online research?

This is a fairly open-ended question, and it’s the kind of thing you can spend a long time answering. A historian might say that you need to read about his life and works extensively. But that kind of time to devote to a single issue is a bit of a luxury. Is there something else one could do? What about Wikipedia, that grand online encyclopedia? How could we use it effectively?

Figure 7.1

Often, the fastest way to search Wikipedia is to do a Google search with the context term「Wikipedia」as part of the query. This not only gives a wide range of results from Wikipedia but also a set of deep links into the Michelangelo article.

There’s a lot of debate about how accurate and reliable Wikipedia is, but the bottom line for me is that for many topics, it’s fairly reliable.1 This is especially true once you know a bit about how to do online research with Wikipedia.

If you’re not already in Wikipedia, the fastest way to search Wikipedia is to do a query like this, adding the context term「Wikipedia」to your search query. The results will be primarily from Wikipedia and Wikimedia.

If the topic that you’re searching on is fairly rich (as this one is), then you’ll see an indented set of items. These are「deep links」into a specific section of the article on Michelangelo; click on them to jump into that section of the Wikipedia page.

If you want to search ONLY within Wikipedia, you can use the site: operator (see chapter 3, where I show how to do this) to search exclusively inside Wikipedia. The results will be limited only to Wikipedia articles.

Now to find out about the possible relationship (or lack thereof) between the two men, you can list both of their names in the query. Scanning the snippets below each result gives a quick overview of their relationship (but don’t stop reading there!).

Figure 7.2

Use a site: operator to search only in the site, and use both names to find articles that mention both of them.

Doing the search [site:Wikipedia.org Leonardo da Vinci Michelangelo] with the two artists’ names will find articles where both are mentioned within Wikipedia. It’s also useful, perhaps as a second step, to do a search for both names without the Wikipedia site: restriction; that will find many articles about their relationship. Starting with just Wikipedia, though, is a great way to quickly learn about their connections.

From the articles on this page, it’s easy to quickly learn that the two men were both highly regarded during their time as strikingly talented artists. What surprised me, however, was learning about the painting of the Battle of Anghiari (by Leonardo) and Battle of Cascina (by Michelangelo)—the only instance when two paintings by both masters were painted at the same time.2 Neither painting was finished, and Leonardo’s seems to be buried beneath later work. But writers at the time judged both incomplete works as evidence of great masters.

Figure 7.3

Searching for the relationship between Michelangelo and da Vinci is another way to get an overview of their interactions. (Of course, be careful about what you read; the first hit here is a novel about the two men. While entertaining, it might not be what you want.)

And while usually named together as the two giants of Renaissance art, Leonardo and Michelangelo just barely worked at the same time. Leonardo was twenty-three when Michelangelo was born and was artistically active for thirty-seven years. Michelangelo began his professional career when he was seventeen and was creative for around fifty-two years, although often in sculpture and architecture rather than painting.

In the same way, you could do a query on Google Books to search for more articles in depth on this topic. Here I’ve done a search on Google Books for the relationship between Michelangelo and da Vinci (figure 7.3). This is a bit like the site: search in that when you search Google Books, the query will only return books that have a hit.

I could go on in more detail about who these Renaissance giants were and why they seemed to have a particularly awkward relationship, but my point here is really to show you how to use online research tools to understand the relationship between two people (famous artists in this case). Wikipedia is a great place to start your research, especially when you realize that Wikipedia has more depth than you might have imagined. In particular, there are a few things worth knowing about how Wikipedia is organized.

Why You Might Want to Read the Italian Wikipedia

You might have been using Wikipedia for quite a while and not noticed that there are entire other worlds of information there on the page for you to examine. Take a look at the left side of this Wikipedia entry about cats. Do you see the column over on the left labeled「Languages」(figure 7.4)?

Wikipedia comes in 287 languages (and more are being added every day). Those links on the left point to the equivalent article in another language.

Notice that the gold star next to the language means that this is a「featured article,」which are given a star by the editors, indicating that this article is of exceptionally high quality and often used as an example for other Wikipedia authors.3 It’s thus frequently worth checking out articles in languages with a star.

What you might not realize is that articles are NOT THE SAME in all the world’s different languages. Even fairly straightforward articles, like this one on「Cat,」can be different, and as such, well worth looking at for comparison purposes.

Here, for example, are the outlines of the cat article in English (on the left) and the Spanish Wikipedia article about cats (on the right, in translation). Note how different they are (figure 7.5).

For some reason, the Spanish authors of the「Cat」entry go into MUCH greater detail about cat diseases (sections 9.1–9.13) than the English authors (where it’s only covered in section 7.1). I have no idea why the English-language entry is so much shorter. Are Spanish-language cats more likely to get sick? That seems silly. But the Spanish-language edition covers, for instance, the effects of secondhand tobacco smoke on the rate of oral cancers among cats. (No surprise here: secondhand smoke is bad for your cat as well.)

Figure 7.4

Wikipedia offers multiple versions of an article in different languages. Here you can see many languages that have an article about cats. Notice the stars next to some languages; those are high-quality articles. It’s often worth checking out articles in languages with a star as they’re usually quite good.

Bear in mind that the topic of「cat」is fairly noncontroversial. When you compare more culturally, historically, or politically loaded topics, the differences become even greater. Consider for a moment how controversial topics are handled: the Wikipedia editorial board locks down articles that tend to attract the most vandalism. (The article about Hilary Clinton is one such example. Ordinary people can’t edit it; only fairly trusted Wikipedian editors can.) But what’s more, all these different languages can give you, the online researcher, a set of different perspectives on a topic.

Now we can get back to my original topic of comparing Leonardo and Michelangelo.

Figure 7.6 is a side-by-side comparison outlining the English and Italian versions of the Wikipedia articles about「Leonardo da Vinci.」It makes sense that the Italian version would be much more comprehensive, but it’s also interesting to read the rather-different treatments that each culture makes about his personal life and relationships.

Notice that just section 1 on the life of Leonardo in Italian (twelve-thousand-plus words) is longer than the entire article about Leonardo in English (a mere eight-thousand-plus words).

And this difference becomes especially obvious when you look at the Italian version of the article about Michelangelo’s Battle of Cascina; it’s a highly detailed and well-documented article. The corresponding English article about the painting is barely three hundred words.4 These kinds of cross-cultural comparisons are fascinating to make, but also potentially really valuable when doing your research. If you’re frustrated by the lack of depth of the Wikipedia article in your own language, try another language, perhaps one that’s「closer to home」for the material. More important, you’ll be getting different views on the topic.

This works for people, institutions, places, and cultures, yet it’s oddly the opposite for some deeply cultural concepts.

For instance, suppose you want to quickly get an understanding of the Danish idea of hygge (which translates into English, roughly, as a「mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with an overall feeling of wellness, quiet happiness, and contentment」). Looking up hygge in the English Wikipedia gives you a pretty good idea of what hygge means, but checking out the Danish version is a disappointment. It’s simple enough to get the translation into English, but the Danish article is fairly short and feels like the sketch of hygge. By contrast, both the English and Italian hygge articles are much longer and more complete (with the Italian one being especially detailed, including a discussion of hygge in nondomestic settings and even recipes for food that are particularly hygge-ish).

When I’m looking to understand a person, place, or thing that is particularly embedded within a culture (or language), then the Wikipedia articles in that language tend to be good. But when looking up a less tangible concept—like Danish hygge, gemütlichkeit (the German version of coziness), or jugaad (the Hindi idea of a quick fix or improvised repair)—these tend to be more expansively defined in any language other than that of its origin. The English Wikipedia article on jugaad is quite good, as is the French version of gemütlichkeit, but if you read the German article on gemütlichkeit, you’ll probably be disappointed.

A Tool for Comparison

A rule of thumb that I use when I find myself trying to do something repeatedly is to look for a tool to help with the task.

In this case, after noticing that I was bringing up multiple side-by-side browser windows to compare Wikipedia articles in different languages, I thought about my rule of thumb. How could I find an online tool that would help me compare two articles side by side? The first query I could think of was:

[tool to compare Wikipedia articles]

This leads, naturally enough, to several hits to pages on Wikipedia that list the features of different file comparison tools; that’s nice, but not quite what I want.

But a bit further down the page I found the Manypedia.com site, which does exactly what I wanted. It lets you look up a single topic and then look at the Wikipedia articles from different languages side by side. For example, if we look up a topic we’re interested in, say, the Italian sculptor Gian Bernini (who was born just seventy-nine years after Leonardo died), we can see the English and Italian (in translation) versions side by side (figure 7.7).

I’ve added two numbers to the screen capture to point out a couple features in the Manypedia interface:

(1) is the list of all the images from the Wikipedia article (each shown as a small thumbnail image). Notice how the list of pictures is VERY different between the two articles. His great work The Hermaphrodite isn’t even mentioned in the English version, yet it shows up in the Italian article. You can spot this immediately by looking at the images summary and noting the differences between the sets of images.

(2) is a kind of word cloud (the font size indicates how often a word appears in the article) just below the images summary for the Wikipedia entries. Again, a quick scan shows real differences between the articles. In the Italian article,「Lorenzo」(which appears 47 times) and「Barberini」(which shows up 14 times) are more important, but by contrast in the English version,「Rome」(appearing 106 times) and「Lorenzo」(found 47 times) dominate.

Figure 7.7

With the Manypedia web app, you can compare different versions of the same Wikipedia entries from different languages. The side-by-side comparison highlights the different values that each culture places into its Wikipedia entries.

If Manypedia shows context between two different language versions of the same page, Wikipedia itself has another way to show context across ALL Wikipedia.

What Links Here

Wikipedia also has a clever method for showing a bit of context that goes beyond the ordinary. The Wikipedia tool「What links here」appears in the left-hand list of links on an ordinary Wikipedia page (figure 7.8).

When you click on「What links here,」you’ll get a long list of all the other Wikipedia pages that have a link to this one—in this case, all the other Wikipedia pages that link to Leonardo’s page.5

Why should you care? Because scanning that list is effectively an overview of the other people, places, times, projects, and influences that somehow connect to Leonardo. It’s as though someone pulled out all the key concepts from Leonardo’s article and presented them to you as a list. I often look at this list when I’m trying to get a sense of what connections there are between my main topic and the rest of the world (figure 7.9).

Figure 7.8

Several Wikipedia tools appear in the left-hand column, including this one that opens up a new page with a list of all the other Wikipedia articles that are linked to this article.

Credit: Wikipedia

For instance, reading through the list of pages that link to「Leonardo da Vinci,」I can see that there’s some connection to Cesare Borgia, a well-known person of the age. By rolling over the link, a pop-up summary appears, and if it looks interesting enough, you can open this article in a new browser tab.

Research Lessons

There are a few lessons here about using Wikipedia as a research tool.

1. Wikipedia comes in multiple languages. When you’re looking up an article on a topic that is highly culturally specific, be sure to look in that language as well. Famous people, places, and things tend to have longer and more detailed descriptions in the language that they’re associated with. (Italian for Leonardo, for instance.)

Figure 7.9

Hovering your mouse over the link will give you a pop-up preview of the linked page. Here you see a summary of Cesare Borgia, one of Leonardo’s patrons in 1502 and 1503.

2. Pay attention to Wikipedia stars. The stars mark articles that are especially well written and complete, and have good references. If you’re looking at an article that seems a bit sketchy or lightweight, look for the same article in another language; if it’s got a star, there’s a good chance that reading the starred article (in translation) will be more useful than the inadequate article you’re reading now.

3. Search for a tool when you find yourself doing something repeatedly. This is good advice in general; when you’re doing something multiple times, this is a candidate for a little computational help. (As a simple example, if you’re doing a lot of math over and over again, stop what you’re doing and learn how to use a spreadsheet.) In our case, there are online tools that can help compare multiple Wikipedia pages, making your learning process a bit more streamlined.

4.「What links here」is a great way to scan the surrounding people, places, and things that have articles linking to your main topic. The list of linked articles is sometimes surprising; it’s worth checking out when you’re trying to get a quick overview of a topic. At the very least, you’ll find a list of the people and places that figure into the story.

Try This Yourself

Check out a few Wikipedia articles in languages that are appropriate for the topic, but in a language you don’t read, write, or speak. You can use Google Translate to convert the articles into a language you DO read.

For example, earlier in this chapter I mentioned Danish hygge, gemütlichkeit (the German version of coziness), and jugaad (the Hindi idea of a quick fix or improvised repair). Look at the differences in each of these concepts in your own language (say, English) and the language of origin (Danish, German, or Hindi). What do these different Wikipedia articles tell you about the cultures of each idea?

Another comparison to make is between the English, Turkish, and German versions of the Wikipedia articles about Göbekli Tepe, a prehistoric site from around 9100 BCE found in central Turkey. Why are the articles in each language different? What do these differences tell you about the cultural perspectives of each? Can you find another culturally specific example of this cross-language effect?

8 Why Are the Coasts So Different? How to Use Online Maps Resources to Answer Broad Geographic Questions

The West and East Coasts of North America look quite different. Why is that? The west coastline has few islands just offshore, with lots of dramatic cliffs. The East Coast, by contrast, has lots of long sandy beaches with mellow islands and places to hang out. But why?

The other day I was standing in a friend’s office at work. On his wall he had a large, beautiful, and high-resolution map of North America. Interestingly, it was black and white, which makes your eye see shapes of landforms in a different way. You don’t get distracted by all the colors and annotations of the political map, or the colors of deserts, grasslands, and forests on a physical map. You just see the shape of the land itself; it’s a kind of clarity of vision that removes all human traces, and you see just the shapes—the topography—pure and plain.

As I stood there looking at it, I noticed something I’d never seen before: that is, the East and West Coasts of the US are quite different. Yes, I know they’re different culturally (Los Angeles versus New York, TMZ versus NPR, etc.). But what I saw for the first time was how topographically different the coasts are from each other. The eastern shores seem crinkly, full of long beaches and low-lying islands just off the coast. That surprised me. You think that I would have noticed before this.

Here are a few side-by-side images from Google Earth to give you a sense of what I mean. I’ve taken three overview shots at different resolutions so you can compare them. In each side by side, the scale is the same (figures 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3).

In this overview of both coasts, what I saw was that the East Coast has LOTS more islands and barrier reefs than the West Coast. That struck me as being really, really different.

Figure 8.1

When you put the West Coast next to the East Coast, the topography looks quite different. The question is, Why?
