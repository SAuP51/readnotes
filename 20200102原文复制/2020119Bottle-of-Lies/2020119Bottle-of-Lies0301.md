# Part III A Cat-and-Mouse Business

## 0301. The Global Cover-Up

NOVEMBER 18, 2004

Little Rock, Arkansas

Dr. Brian Tempest and several other Ranbaxy executives huddled by the Arkansas River in plastic ponchos under a driving rain. They were determined to make the most of the soggy event, which included President George W. Bush, three former U.S. presidents, and numerous members of Congress. Ranbaxy had donated close to `$250,000` so its directors could be at the opening of the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum.

By their side was Dr. Agnes Varis, the founder and CEO of AgVar Chemicals, who had been serving for some time as their political chaperone in the United States. A major Democratic Party donor with a deep knowledge of America’s drug industry, she was a longtime friend of the Clintons and had taken Ranbaxy executives to parties at their Westchester home. When Clinton’s presidency ended, Varis had put a political bumper sticker on her chauffeured Bentley that read I MISS BILL. She had contributed nearly `$500,000` to the Clinton Foundation for the library dedication.

Using the event as leverage, Ranbaxy did everything possible to link itself to the former president. The company released a public statement touting its「close association」with the Clinton Foundation and their shared goal of「providing pharmacotherapy to patients stricken with AIDS in financially depressed countries.」A subsequent Ranbaxy newsletter described the company as an「honored guest at this momentous event.」Though certainly an overstatement, it was true that Clinton took extraordinary steps to thank Ranbaxy for its role in making cheap HIV drugs for Africa.

Within six months of the library dedication, Clinton returned to India, where he spent more time with Malvinder Singh and other Ranbaxy executives on an AIDS panel and at a cocktail event. So much face time with the former U.S. president was like jet fuel for the company’s public image — and its bottom line.

From a distance, Ranbaxy’s ascent appeared unchecked. By early 2004, the company’s global sales had surpassed `$1` billion. In the United States, Ranbaxy had become the fastest-growing foreign generics maker, with ninety-six products on pharmacy shelves and fifty more applications before the FDA. Its medicine had become important to the AIDS programs of two American presidents. And the company had big future plans: to reach `$5` billion in global sales by 2012, move from the world’s eighth-largest generic drug company into the top five, and launch its own specialty products.

The company’s marketers spelled all this out in a newsletter, Ranbaxy World, which emphasized the company’s integrity and social commitment. It pointed to new quality initiatives, Ranbaxy’s elaborate code of conduct, and its dedication to making low-cost antiretroviral drugs for poor Africans. As the newsletter stated, the company’s「quest for growth and excellence goes hand in hand with unflinching commitment to integrity in all relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, government, local communities, collaborators and shareholders.」

Beneath this gauzy sentiment, glimpses of a different sort of company were visible. One week after the library dedication, President of Pharmaceuticals Malvinder Singh gave an interview to an Indian website in which he attributed Ranbaxy’s success, in part, to being a「very aggressive marketing company, fighting for a market share at rock-bottom prices and making that model work.」He didn’t explain how the model worked exactly, but went on to say,「Ranbaxy is today what it is because we took the risks.」He would later explain that Ranbaxy had risked being the first Indian pharmaceutical company to set up operations and manufacturing facilities outside of India.

But inside the company, executives were grappling with a different set of risks.

The initial disclosure of fraud at Vimta, the company Ranbaxy had hired to test its AIDS drugs, was like a teetering domino, threatening to topple interconnected drug applications approved by regulators around the world. As charitable organizations asked the company for underlying data to support its claims, the problem confronting Ranbaxy executives had become almost unsolvable. Drugs that had never been tested, or whose tests revealed a failing product, were now due to be reregistered in countries around the world. Much of the raw data didn’t match what the company had filed with regulators. Either it didn’t exist, didn’t make sense, or had been fabricated at some point. A refusal to share the data would trigger further suspicion, leaving the company with two bad options: come clean — which would have disastrous business consequences — or lie more.

The company needed to start testing drugs properly. But that not only risked exposing past fraud but often required a new set of lies. This Catch-22 played out in a torrent of confidential emails in which Dr. Tempest and future CEO Malvinder Singh were often cc’ed and also weighed in. In mid-July 2004, a UNICEF official asked why Ranbaxy had submitted only limited stability data for several of its AIDS drugs. Companies must prove that their drugs will remain stable in a range of temperature conditions. The required tests, which help to establish the shelf life of a drug and measure impurities over time, are conducted in chambers that resemble oversized refrigerators, which can replicate extremes of heat and cold.

UNICEF’s question prompted a round of panicky internal emails. In one titled「Stability Studies — Urgent,」an executive wrote,「According to UNICEF, if we fail to furnish the data by Wednesday evening and do not provide the information requested in the mail below, then we can forget about this tender.」He added,「this tender is worth `$5` million and we cannot take nay chances on it.」

But the only data that Ranbaxy had to give UNICEF was a nonsensical hodgepodge that would raise more questions. The limited testing that Ranbaxy had done on the HIV drugs showed some impurities remaining constant or even decreasing between nine and twelve months, which was technically impossible. As an executive pointed out, these problems「will certainly raise a doubt in the mind of the reviewer . . . we need to revise this number.」

Executives grappled with similar problems in dossiers for markets around the world. In February 2005, a company executive wrote to colleagues regarding the company’s filing in Spain for the antibiotic cefuroxime axetil:「Please advice the way forward. This dossier was scheduled to go in Dec, 04. We have been waiting for your response for the last 2 months. We need to conclude this ASAP.」This email triggered a terse reply from a senior scientist:「During our discussion in Gurgaon on 27th Jan, I mentioned clearly that the data in our Archives and that of the filed one is Differing Entirely. So, I cannot send the Data.」

Months earlier, in September 2004, as the FDA evaluated Ranbaxy’s PEPFAR application for certain AIDS drugs, it asked to see data the company had filed with the World Health Organization. The director of regulatory affairs, Dr. Arun Kumar, wrote to colleagues, including Dr. Tempest:「In case we do not share the data at this stage we will be under question. . . . Reasons for not sharing the data on existing batches could be difficult to explain.」He added,「We are crossroads becoz adequate data has not been generated on the products as per WHO requirements.」

This was particularly problematic, as the company had assiduously cultivated its relationship with the FDA. In the intense debate over what data to share with the agency, Ranbaxy’s U.S. president, Dipak Chattaraj, noted in an email that the two top officials in the FDA’s Office of Generic Drugs「are so well disposed towards Ranbaxy that trying to [be] difficult with them can only cost and not help us.」

The company’s problems with the FDA were far bigger than just the drugs intended for Africa. Ranbaxy had not properly tested the stability of almost any drugs on the U.S. market. The most basic good manufacturing practices require continuous monitoring of drug quality. Drug stability must be tested at intervals called「stations」: three months, six months, nine months, and so on. So long as a drug is on the market, that data has to be filed in an annual report with the FDA. One is never out of data, because obtaining it is simply part of the process.

But the company had hit an impasse, leaving its executives to confront the fact that they had virtually no thirty-six-month stability data to submit for any U.S. commercial batches. This was more than an「oops.」It was the equivalent of trying to read a roadmap upside down — after you’ve already crashed the car into a tree.

In frantic emails, executives grappled with this seemingly insurmountable problem. Abha Pant sent a terse email to her colleagues:「This is a very serious issue. I do not know how are we going to file the Annual Reports and what reasons are we going to give to the [FDA] for not submitting the stability data. . . . We need all this data and there is no way out.」

Even as company executives resolved to start testing the drugs in「right earnest,」as one of them put it, a similar crisis was playing out in dossiers around the world. By 2005, twenty-two high-priority products faced reregistration in at least one country. All had been made at Ranbaxy’s Dewas manufacturing plant in Madhya Pradesh, and none had been tested adequately. Arun Kumar explained to his colleagues in an email,「For most of the products the data is not available, and also the archival data is not there.」In short, they had never been tested.

In assessing the task before them, a quality assurance director at Dewas wrote to his colleagues in February 2005, cc’ing Brian Tempest,「We are going to start almost on zero basis in case of majority of products where we do not have required stability data. The task seems very difficult.」In other words, drugs already on the market had to be tested from the ground up. By then, Tempest had sent the director of global quality an urgent email:「There will be no business left to pay your salaries unless we get on top of the stability work for re registrations.」

Previously, the company had taken data from fledgling research and development batches and falsely represented in filings that it came from much larger exhibit batches, which are harder to control. One troubling drug was the co-amoxiclav suspension, the antibiotic that is often used to treat ear infections in children, the same medication that had failed to cure Thakur’s son. Ranbaxy had registered the drug with a twenty-four-month shelf life in almost thirty countries, but tests showed that its shelf life was actually closer to eighteen months. In reregistering the drug, a senior consultant noted in an email, cc’ing Tempest and Malvinder Singh, it would be「useful」to have a「plausible explanation for this reduction in shelf life」when dealing with the regulatory agencies.

If most executives were seeking guidance on how best to lie to regulators, others were concerned about the fraud they were expected to commit as part of their job. Some balked at filing false data. Others flat-out refused to participate in illegal acts. However, sometimes even the most scrupulous employees ended up being drafted, unwittingly, into the company’s fraudulent schemes. Most Ranbaxy executives were expected to carry suitcases full of brand-name drugs when they traveled to India. At Ranbaxy’s New Jersey headquarters, suitcases purchased at the local Walmart were kept packed with drugs, waiting for the next traveler to India. The suitcase-toting seemed innocent enough. Most executives assumed that the drugs were needed for research and development.

Generic drug companies often study small amounts of a brand-name product in order to reverse-engineer it or to reference it as a point of comparison in applications. But proper channels for purchasing and transporting such drugs are well established and became ironclad with the 2001 passage of the Patriot Act. Personal transport of drugs was technically illegal and a form of smuggling. To the dozens of employees pressed into ferrying the drugs, often on an emergency basis, it seemed like a minor shortcut, possibly to cut shipping costs, avoid quarantine, or speed up delivery.

In one year alone, seventeen executives took undeclared drugs from the New Jersey office through Indian customs, four of them doing so multiple times. The most frequent couriers included the company’s U.S. president and even its U.S. executive director of regulatory affairs, Abha Pant, who was responsible for ensuring that the company followed the rules.

At Ranbaxy, top executives skirted these regulations and sometimes oversaw the illegal ferrying of drugs at the very moment when the company faced deadlines to resubmit data to regulators. Some executives came to suspect that the company was using the brand-name samples as a substitute for its own, in order to generate data showing how closely Ranbaxy’s drug matched the brand it was seeking to replicate. This would explain the urgency surrounding the drug runs, especially when some Ranbaxy staffers strenuously resisted being used as drug mules.

In May 2004, a regulatory project manager refused to take French brand-name samples to India. He protested in an email,「I will NOT be bring any samples with me, not only I believe is this company policy but I personally do not feel comfortable bringing samples in this manner.」An executive pushed back:「It is critical that the samples are carried by you. We cannot delay it.」The employee flatly refused.

Malvinder Singh, then the company’s worldwide head of pharmaceuticals, got involved. Through his secretary, he asked when the samples would reach Gurgaon.「These products have been sitting in our London office and it is a pity to see that nobody takes ownership of them.」

This triggered a response from the company’s president of global pharmaceutical business:「Dear Malvinder, I need to explain to you how labour laws work within Europe. As taking these samples to India is in principle illegal we cannot force people to do so. . . . Normally however we find our people willing to take the risk.」So important was this to the company’s business that the executive then went on to make an extraordinary suggestion to Singh: that since Tempest and Singh had been passing through the United Kingdom on a regular basis,「[I] would ask you to in future also make yourself available for carrying samples back.」Other senior executives were also pressed into service.

In the event that they were caught, those who carried the drugs for Ranbaxy were given a letter claiming the products were for research and development and had no commercial value. In June 2004, one executive got stopped by Indian customs with hundreds of packs of an antinausea drug, Kytril, worth thousands of dollars that he hadn’t declared. The drugs were seized. One Ranbaxy executive noted internally that「in the absence of correct documents this is considered as an illegal way of bringing the medicine in to India.」

The lies and efforts to conceal them absorbed the energies of the entire company. In August 2004, the company’s top executives, including Tempest and Malvinder Singh, held a meeting in the executive conference room. On the agenda, according to emails, was the「strategy for filling gap between requirement & availability.」In other words, how were they going to submit data they didn’t have?

In September 2004, the executives met again and opted for a solution: to move the most important manufacturing for the United States and PEPFAR from the troubled Dewas plant to the newer one in Paonta Sahib, in the hope that by severing links to the past fraudulent manufacturing, regulators would not detect it. Instead, Dewas, which had almost nonexistent quality systems, would remain the manufacturing site for the least-regulated markets, including Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam, and elsewhere.

Publicly, company executives spun this change as a response to big demand from the American market and PEPFAR. In early January 2005, at a meeting of Indian generic drug makers and AIDS activists in Mumbai, Ranbaxy’s HIV and essential drugs project manager, Sandeep Juneja, explained to the meeting attendees that the company’s new strategy would result in its drugs being quickly approved by PEPFAR and reinstated on the WHO list.「We wanted to harmonise everything to the U.S. market and consolidate manufacturing in one place,」he said.「If a product is approved by the FDA, then it is accepted anywhere.」

Two days later, Arun Kumar wrote to a UNICEF official, explaining the shift in the manufacturing site for lamivudine, an AIDS drug:「We have changed the site of manufacture of the product from Dewas to Paonta Sahib facility to facilitate handling high business requirements.」Four days after making that claim, however, as the company prepared to resubmit the data for its antiretroviral drugs to the WHO, Juneja reiterated the company’s real strategy in an email, cc’ing Tempest.「We have been reasonably successful in keeping WHO from looking closely at the stability data in the past,」he wrote, adding,「The last thing we want is to have another inspection at Dewas until we fix all the process and validation issues once and for all.」

But the shift to Paonta Sahib was far from a perfect solution. In some cases, the new studies weren’t going to be completed in time to meet new registration dates. As one executive asked in an email, how were they going to handle the「interim situation,」where regulators were demanding new data that wasn’t ready yet? If the data came from Dewas,「how do we use them in the Paonta dossier?」The answer from a colleague came back:「pl speak to me over the phone. I shall be able to answer yr query.」The answer was almost certainly interim fraud, or temporarily representing old data from Dewas as new data from Paonta Sahib.

However, as Ranbaxy geared up to start testing drugs at Paonta Sahib and redirect the world’s most important regulators to that plant, the company wanted to leave nothing to chance. And legitimate testing — where drug batches can fail and formulas can become unstable — was the ultimate game of chance. Investigating the why is difficult and costly. Good manufacturing practices are so laborious precisely because they require innumerable steps to make an uncertain process more certain. If you have to actually test drugs, how can you best control the outcome? How do you put your finger on the scale each time in order to generate perfect data?

Ranbaxy came up with a rather ingenious, well-hidden solution. Whether it remained hidden would depend, in large part, on the next FDA investigator who walked into the plant. Would it be someone content to look merely at the well-polished surface? Or someone committed to piecing together a mosaic of clues? The company had no way to control which investigator showed up.

But two months after Raj Kumar made his ill-fated presentation to Ranbaxy’s board of directors, the company had a stroke of luck. The next FDA investigator to arrive at Ranbaxy’s Paonta Sahib manufacturing plant in Himachal Pradesh was Dr. Muralidhara B. Gavini.

At the FDA, Muralidhara Gavini, who was widely known as Mike, had distinguished himself in one important respect: he was one of the few investigators not only willing but happy to do foreign inspections in India.

Most of the agency’s investigators did not want to travel there, especially as their colleagues returned with stories of broiling heat, incessant rain, harrowing traffic, hours spent traveling to distant manufacturing plants over pitted, washed-out roads, and the ubiquitous threat of getting sick from unclean water or contaminated food, which forced them to bring suitcases of peanut butter and granola bars. The difficult travel had contributed to a growing crisis at the FDA.

In theory, the agency tried to inspect every facility making drug ingredients for the U.S. market roughly every two years, whether the plant was in Maryland or Mumbai. But the FDA’s actual rate of inspections overseas was closer to once a decade, and the backlog of applications from foreign drug facilities was growing rapidly. The FDA had no obvious solution for who to send to inspect overseas plants and how to pay for it all. The agency was so desperate that it had even explored doing remote inspections, in which the plants would supply videotapes of their facilities. The proposal for inspections by videotape cited「ever-decreasing resources.」

In a system starved for volunteers, Mike Gavini was in high demand. The area around Hyderabad was beginning to develop, and his inspections took him back to his old stomping grounds. He’d grown up in Guntur, south of Hyderabad. Sending Gavini there did not violate any agency rules, in part because there weren’t too many at that point. But it did violate a basic principle. As one of Gavini’s colleagues would later observe,「You never send people to their native area. That’s just Regulatory 101.」Such an arrangement could invite corruption and compromise. But Gavini was eager for a homecoming.

He had first left India in 1972 to pursue a PhD in chemistry at the University of Arkansas. For him, America and the town of Fayetteville, were alien environments. But his work was good enough to land him a job at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, where he continued his research, tracing plutonium isotopes in rainwater. At Woods Hole, he uncovered traces of curium in the sediment of Lake Ontario and presented his findings at a national meeting of the American Chemical Society. Unwittingly, he had revealed runoff from a secret nuclear facility. Amid recriminations, his career as a scientist ended.

With three children to support, he spent the next ten years at a laboratory testing company until a management change left him looking for work again. In 1996, he took a 70 percent pay cut and joined the FDA’s New Jersey district office, where he got paid `$35,000` a year to visit dairy farms and look for evidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease). With his PhD and a decade of private-sector experience, he was an「oddball,」as he recalled. By 1999, he was promoted to a position as a compliance officer at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).

He may have been out of his depth in Fayetteville and given short shrift at the FDA, but in India he was a bigwig. Not only did he have a PhD, which automatically commanded respect, but he also represented the world’s most powerful regulator. Most of the time, he went alone to the plants — an inspectional「one-man army,」as he put it. He — and he alone — could determine whether to clear a plant to export its drugs to the United States, a project he undertook without clearly defined rules.

Domestic inspections had long followed a clear formula. The FDA’s investigators would show up unannounced at U.S. factories and stay as long as they needed to follow data trails wherever they led.「We walk in, show the badge, give them notice of inspection,」as FDA investigator Jose Hernandez put it. The relationship with the facility was also clear: there was none.「Those guys [in New Jersey] won’t even take a cup of coffee,」as one investigator put it.

But the rules for overseas inspections were muddy at best. Seeking to avoid confrontations that might involve a foreign government and lead to an international incident, the FDA prioritized diplomacy over confrontation. It announced its visits to the plants weeks, even months, in advance, and relied on the companies to act as hosts and travel agents for its investigators, booking hotels and ground transportation. This suited Gavini.

The approach he chose was collaborative. He viewed himself as a partner, educating the companies as to what constituted robust quality systems.「He conducted himself more as a consultant,」one of his colleagues noted. Gavini regarded the FDA and the companies as sharing the same objectives.「We’re not on opposite sides of the table,」he said.「Quality is our goal.」

He tried to improve the companies’ techniques. He taught them how to clean manufacturing equipment properly and stressed「common sense.」The industry, he said,「learned a hell of a lot from me.」His personal measure for each inspection was,「Have I contributed positively at this company? The net result should be positive.」It certainly was. As he inspected, the pharmaceutical sector in Hyderabad grew under his watch, churning out active ingredients and ultimately becoming the bulk-drug capital of India.

Gavini put in ten- to twelve-hour days. He expressed disdain for colleagues who worked shorter hours or filed their reports months after the fact. But on the rare occasion when colleagues accompanied him, they were dismayed by what they saw: the chumminess of his relations with the companies he was inspecting; his direct communications with the executives, in person and by phone; and his tendency to let companies off the hook. He would even send draft versions of his regulatory findings, called 483 reports, to the companies for review before he submitted them officially.

Gavini rejected what he saw as needless secrecy.「I don’t know why FDA investigators keep everything to themselves,」he said.「I discuss every aspect I am writing [with the companies].」This gave companies the opportunity to influence his findings. If the firm said that it would fix its problems, that was good enough for Gavini. In one 2003 inspection report, he even documented how a plant’s managing director had pledged improvements by phone, a promise that he deemed「satisfactory.」

The honor system was a bad way to improve drug quality — at least, according to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) written in 1998, two years before Gavini started his inspections. The report bashed the FDA for downgrading inspectional findings based on「foreign manufacturers’ promises」to make changes.「As a result, FDA conducted fewer reinspections of these facilities to verify that foreign manufacturers had corrected serious manufacturing deficiencies.」

Gavini was not inclined to treat his countrymen like criminals, he would later explain. But as the pharmaceutical sector in Hyderabad exploded — and FDA investigators returned to facilities that Gavini had previously cleared to find grievous violations — his reputation as a lax investigator spread. Among his colleagues, he came to be known as the quintessential「NAI Inspector」: one whose most common finding was No Action Indicated.

On December 17, 2004, to the delight of Ranbaxy’s executives, Mike Gavini, an investigator they knew well, arrived at the Paonta Sahib plant. He was there for a preapproval inspection to make sure the facility could adequately make two AIDS drugs, lamivudine and zidovudine, for the U.S. AIDS relief program in Africa.

His arrival was not a surprise to the company. As was typical for the FDA’s foreign inspections, a visit had been announced weeks in advance, and the company was involved in planning it. In his summary of the inspection, Gavini noted:「The firm provided transportation to and from the plant」and「accommodations were provided.」

Gavini stayed for five days. Trailing him throughout the plant were many of the same executives who’d been sending panicked messages to one another about the lack of data. Gavini saw none of that. In his inspection report, he noted some unclear instructions in batch records and unclear cleaning procedures. However, he gave unqualified praise to the company’s program of stability testing, which exposes drugs to different temperatures and humidity levels to see how fast they degrade in different environments and what their expiration date should be. He noted:「Stability sample traffic in and out of the chambers was monitored and the stability inventory maintained properly.」

To come to this conclusion, Gavini must have walked directly past a Thermolab stability refrigerator that had been installed seven months earlier. The large walk-in refrigerator was maintained at 4 degrees Celsius. Use of the refrigerator was not noted on any of the company’s applications with the FDA. Had Gavini opened it, he would have found hundreds of bottles of samples that had not been recorded, stuffed inside cardboard boxes.

Why Ranbaxy was using the refrigerator would become one of the most contentious, bitterly fought questions for years to come. But again, Gavini didn’t raise any questions. To Ranbaxy’s nervous executives, he was a dream investigator, either unable to find or not on the lookout for illicit solutions to drug testing.

Not surprisingly, his findings were minimal. He gave the plant a clean bill of health and determined that it was in「overall compliance」with current good manufacturing practices. His conclusion was NAI: No Action Indicated.

第三部分 猫鼠游戏

对全世界隐瞒

2004 年 11 月 18 日阿肯色州小石城

在阿肯色河畔，布赖恩·坦皮斯特博士和兰伯西的几名高管在倾盆大雨中披着塑料雨衣缩成一团。他们决定好好利用在大雨滂沱中举行的这次活动，因为参加者包括现任总统小布什、三位前总统和多位国会议员。兰伯西捐献了近 25 万美元，才换来让公司董事参加克林顿总统图书馆与博物馆开张仪式的机会。

陪在他们身边的是阿格尼丝·瓦里斯博士，阿格瓦化学公司的创立者和 CEO，她在美国做他们的政治监护人已经有一段时间了。瓦里斯给民主党捐了许多钱，对美国的制药业也有深刻认识，她很早就成了克林顿夫妇的朋友，还带着兰伯西的高管参加过他们在韦斯特切斯特的家里举办的派对。克林顿卸任之后，她在她那辆由专职司机驾驶的宾利车的保险杠上贴了一张政治性贴纸 ——「我想念比尔」。她向克林顿基金会捐赠了近 50 万美元，用于图书馆建设。

利用这次活动，兰伯西竭尽全力和这位前总统攀上了关系。公司发布了一则公告，宣扬其与克林顿基金会的「密切合作」以及两家机构「向经济萧条的国家受艾滋病摧残的患者提供药物治疗」的共同目标。公司接着又发了一份内部通讯录，说公司是「这场重大活动的一名贵客」。虽然这肯定是夸张之词，但克林顿确实罕见地感谢了兰伯西在非洲生产廉价抗艾滋病药物的贡献。

在捐赠图书馆仪式之后不到六个月，克林顿再次来到印度，在一场艾滋病座谈会和一场鸡尾酒会上，他与马尔文德·辛格等兰伯西高管打了更多的交道。能和美国前总统面谈这么久，就像给公司的公众形象（以及公司的净利润）这架飞机加满了航空燃油。

拉开一点距离来看，兰伯西的上升势头显得不可阻挡。2004 年年初，公司的全球销售额已经超过 10 亿美元。在美国，它也成为成长最快的国外仿制药生产商，它的 96 种产品已经在药房上架，另有 50 种正在接受美国药监局的审批。它生产的药物已成为两任美国总统的艾滋病项目中的重要组成部分。公司对未来也有宏伟的打算：到 2012 年全球销售额达到 50 亿美元，从世界排名第八的仿制药公司上升到前五，并推出自己的特色产品。

公司的营销人员在公司内刊《兰伯西世界》中详细说明了这些打算，这份内刊还强调了公司的诚信和社会责任。它介绍了新的品质方案 ——「兰伯西精细行为准则」以及公司为非洲贫困国家制造抗逆转录病毒药物的努力。内刊宣称，公司「在与员工、客户、供应商、政府、当地社区、合作者以及股东的合作中，在追求公司发展和追求卓越的同时，也要不懈地保持诚信」。

然而在这层浅薄的情怀表达的背后，可以隐约看见公司的另外一面。在图书馆捐赠仪式结束一周之后，药物总监马尔文德·辛格接受了一家印度网站的采访，他说兰伯西之所以成功，部分是因为它是「一家非常激进的营销企业，我们以最低的价格争夺市场份额，并使这个模式运转起来」。他没有详细说明这个模式是如何运转的，只是继续说道：「兰伯西能有今天，是因为我们敢于冒险。」他后来解释说，所谓冒险，是指兰伯西是第一家在印度以外运营并设立生产工厂的印度制药公司。

然而在公司内部，高管们却在与另一套不同的风险体系搏斗。

在受兰伯西委托检测抗艾滋病药物的维姆塔实验室被曝出欺诈丑闻之后，摇摇欲坠的多米诺骨牌仿佛被推倒了，全球的监管者审批过的相关药物申请都要被驳回了。当慈善组织要兰伯西出示证据支持其主张时，兰伯西的高管们遇到了一个几乎无解的难题。那些从未经过检测的药物或者未通过检测的药物，现在都必须在世界各国重新注册一遍。大量原始数据与公司提交给监管者的文件不符。它们要么不存在，要么自相矛盾，要么在某个地方有编造的痕迹。如果公司拒绝公开数据，就会招来更多怀疑，并面临两个不利选择：一是坦白交代，这会造成商业上的灾难性后果；二是撒更多的谎。

公司必须开始对药物做正规的检测。但这不仅有暴露过去诈骗的危险，还常常需要编造一套新的谎言。这个进退两难的局面表现在大量机密电子邮件当中，其中有许多抄送给了坦皮斯特博士和未来的 CEO 马尔文德·辛格，两人也常常参与讨论。2004 年 7 月中旬，一名联合国儿童基金会的官员询问兰伯西的几款抗艾滋病药物为何只提交了有限的稳定性数据。他要求公司证明这几款药物能在各种温度条件下保持稳定。这需要开展几项检测，以确定药物的保质期并测量它们在不同时间的杂质变化情况，这些检测要在变温室中进行，类似能模拟极端冷热环境的大号冰箱。

联合国儿童基金会提出的疑问导致公司内部展开了一连串恐慌的电子邮件沟通。在一封题为「稳定性研究：紧急」的电子邮件中，一名高管这样写道：「照儿童基金会的意思，要是我们未能在周三傍晚之前交出数据，并按下方邮件的要求提供信息，那我们就不用去投标了。」他接着补充道，「这次投标的金额有 500 万美元，必须万无一失。」

然而，兰伯西唯一能交给基金会的数据是一团乱麻，毫无意义。兰伯西对抗艾滋病药物开展的有限检测显示，要让一些杂质的含量在 9 到 12 个月内保持不变，甚至还有所下降，这从技术上说是不可能的。正如一名高管指出的那样，这些问题「肯定会引起审批者的怀疑…… 我们需要修改这些数据」。

在世界各国的市场，高管们都在和申请文件中的类似问题搏斗。2005 年 2 月，一名高管给同事写电子邮件，谈到公司在西班牙就抗生素头孢呋辛酯（cefuroxime axetil）提交的申请：「请透露各位的工作进展。这批申请文件原计划在 2004 年 12 月提交。我们过去两个月一直在等你们的回复。我们需要尽快得出结论。」这封电子邮件引出了一位高级科学家的简要答复：「在我们 1 月 27 日在古尔冈的讨论中，我明确提及我们存档的数据与申请数据完全不同。因此我无法发送数据。」

几个月前，也就是 2004 年 9 月，美国药监局评估兰伯西为加入总统防艾计划提交的几种抗艾滋病药物申请时，提出要看看公司提交给世卫组织的数据。法规事务总监阿伦·库马尔给包括坦皮斯特博士在内的同事写了一封电子邮件：「如果我们现阶段不共享数据，就会招来质疑…… 我们很难给出理由解释为何不共享现有批次的数据。」他补充道，「我们现在进退两难，因为这些产品还不具备符合世卫组织要求的充分数据。」

这尤其会产生问题，因为公司曾经努力培养与美国药监局的关系。高管们就哪些数据可以与美国药监局共享展开了激烈辩论。兰伯西的美国分部总裁迪帕克·查特拉吉（Dipak Chattaraj）在一封电子邮件中指出，美国药监局仿制药办公室的两位高级官员「对兰伯西很有好感，让他们为难的话对我们只有坏处没有好处」。

公司和美国药监局之间的麻烦远比专供非洲的药物要严重。对几乎所有在美国市场销售的药物，兰伯西都没有做过正规的稳定性检测。良好生产规范的最低要求是对药物品质做持续监督。公司必须定期对药物的稳定性进行检测，两次检测之间的间隔被称为「站点」（stations），比如三个月、六个月、九个月。一种药物只要还在市场上销售，其数据就必须写进年度报告提交给美国药监局。数据是绝对不能断的，因为收集数据本身就是生产的一个环节。

但是现在公司陷入了僵局，高管们必须直面一个事实：对于任何在美国出售的商业批次，他们几乎都没有为期 36 个月的稳定性数据可供提交。这可不仅仅是「哎呀，疏忽了」这么简单，而是相当于开车时拿倒了地图，而且就在你把车子撞到一棵树上之后。

高管们紧张忙乱地发着一封封电子邮件，纠结于这个似乎无法克服的难题。艾卜哈·潘特给同事们发了一封简要的邮件：「这个问题非常严重。我不知道该怎么提交年度报告，又该怎么向美国药监局解释没有提交稳定性数据的事…… 我们现在需要所有的数据，除此之外没有别的办法。」

正当公司高管们决心像一位高管所说的那样，「非常认真」地开始检测自家的药物时，一场类似的关于申请文件的危机正在全世界上演。到 2005 年，有 22 种高级别药物需要在至少一个国家重新注册。这些药物都是在兰伯西设立于中央邦德瓦斯的工厂生产的，没有一种得到过充分的检测。阿伦·库马尔在一封电子邮件中向同事表明：「大多数产品都找不到数据，连档案里也没有。」简单地说就是，它们从来没有经过检测。

2005 年 2 月，评估眼前的任务时，德瓦斯的一名质保主任写信给他的同事，并抄送了一份给布赖恩·坦皮斯特：「对于大多数缺乏必要的稳定性数据的产品，我们几乎都要从零开始检测。这估计将是一项非常艰巨的任务。」换句话说，对已经上市的药物，必须从头开始检测。到这时，坦皮斯特已经给全球品质总监发过一封紧急邮件：「如果不做好重新注册所需的稳定性检测工作，公司就没有生意可做，甚至没法给你们发工资了。」

公司曾经向监管者提交初步研发批次的数据，并谎称它们来自规模更大也更难控制的展示批次。其中有一种令人不安的药物是复合阿莫西林 - 克拉维酸（co-amoxiclav）悬浮液，这是一种经常被用来治疗儿童耳部感染的抗生素，也就是萨库尔的儿子吃了没用的那种药。兰伯西在近 30 个国家给这种药物注册的保质期为 24 个月，但检测表明它的真实保质期只有 18 个月左右。在重新注册这种药物时，公司的一名高级顾问在一封抄送给坦皮斯特和马尔文德·辛格的电子邮件中写道：在和监管机构打交道时，「对保质期的缩短做出可信的解释」将会「有用」。

大多数高管都在寻求如何在监管者面前把谎撒得天衣无缝，其他人则担心，被要求参与欺诈已经成了他们工作中的一部分。他们有的不再提交虚假数据，还有的果断拒绝参与非法行为。然而有的时候，就连最遵守道德的员工也会在不经意间卷入公司的欺诈阴谋。比如，公司要求大多数到印度的高管都要带上一个装满品牌药的旅行箱。在兰伯西美国分部的新泽西总部，一个个从附近沃尔玛买来的旅行箱里塞满药物，等待着下一个前往印度出差的人把它们带走。这个用旅行箱带药的做法似乎别无嫌疑。大部分高管都认为这些药物是用来做研发的。

仿制药公司经常会拿少量品牌药做研究，或为分析其成分，或为申请时用来做对比参考。但是 2001 年通过的《爱国者法案》已经限定了购买和运输这些药物的正规途径。严格来说，个人运输药物是违法的，属于走私行为。而在几十名被迫运药而且常在紧急情况下运药的员工看来，这似乎只是一条小小的捷径，其目的不外乎是降低运费、规避检疫或加快运输过程。

在一年的时间里，有 17 名高管将未经申报的药物从新泽西办公室带入印度海关，其中四人曾经多次运药。最常充当运送人员的包括公司的美国分部总裁，甚至包括在美国负责法规事务的副总裁艾卜哈·潘特 —— 她的职责可是确保公司遵守规章。

在兰伯西，顶层高管们规避这些规章，有时，到了公司应该向监管者重新提交数据的最后期限，他们甚至会亲自监督非法运药。也有些高管开始怀疑，公司是在用品牌药代替自家的药物，并用品牌药的数据证明兰伯西的药物与之高度相似。这样就可以解释为什么偷运药物的命令会如此紧迫了，特别是当一些员工极力抗拒公司利用他们走私药物的时候。

2004 年 5 月，一名法规项目经理拒绝将法国产的品牌药样品带入印度。他在一封电子邮件中抗议道：「我不会携带任何样品，我不仅不相信这是公司的规定，也对这种携带样品的做法感到不舒服。」一名高管驳斥道：「这批样品必须由你携带，我们不能拖延。」那名员工断然回绝。

时任公司全球药物总监的马尔文德·辛格也被卷了进来。通过秘书，他询问这批样品何时能送到古尔冈。「这些产品一直放在我们的伦敦办公室里，看到它们无人认领实在可惜。」

公司全球制药业务总裁因此写了一封回信：「亲爱的马尔文德，我有必要向你说明欧洲劳动法的规定。从原则上说，将这些药物带往印度是非法行为，因此我们不能强迫员工这么做…… 无论员工自己多么愿意冒这个险。」然而这对于公司的业务又如此重要，以至于那位高管接着向辛格提出了一个异乎寻常的建议：既然坦皮斯特和辛格常常会过境英国，「我建议未来你们亲自将样品带回印度」。他还敦促其他顶层高管也以同样的方式服务公司。

为了防止被抓，所有为兰伯西带药的人都会得到一封信件，声称他们携带的产品只会用于研发，没有商业价值。2004 年 6 月，一名高管被印度海关扣留，随身搜出了数百包抗呕吐药物凯特瑞（Kytril），价值数千美元，且从未申报。海关将药物没收。兰伯西的一名高管在公司内部指出：「在缺乏正当文件的情况下，将药物这样带入印度算非法行为。」

谎言和隐瞒谎言的努力消耗了整个公司的精力。2004 年 8 月，包括坦皮斯特和马尔文德·辛格在内的公司顶层在高管会议室举行了一次会议。根据电子邮件，这次会议的议程是「填补需求和供应之间的空缺」。换言之，就是如何提交他们没有的数据。

2004 年 9 月，高层再次集会并选出一个方案：问题重重的德瓦斯工厂将不再为美国市场和总统防艾计划生产药物，这项最重要的生产任务将会转移到帕奥恩塔萨希布的新工厂。他们希望，只要切断与过去欺诈性生产的联系，监管者就不能发现什么问题。几无品质保证体系可言的德瓦斯工厂将继续为监管最松懈的市场生产药物，包括巴西、墨西哥、越南等地。

在公开场合，公司的高管们将这个变动说成为应对美国市场和总统防艾计划的庞大需求。2005 年 1 月初，在孟买举行的一次印度仿制药生产商和艾滋病活动家的会议上，兰伯西的抗艾滋病药物及基本药物项目经理桑迪普·朱内贾（Sandeep Juneja）向与会者表明，公司实施新战略后，其药物会很快被总统防艾计划批准，并重新进入世卫组织的名单。「我们想把所有资源整合到美国市场，并将生产整合到一个地方。」他说，「如果一种产品获得了美国药监局的批准，它就等于被全世界接受了。」

两天后，阿伦·库马尔致信联合国儿童基金会的一位官员，解释为什么要变更抗艾滋病药物拉米夫定的生产地点：「我们将产品的生产地点由德瓦斯改到帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂，是为了满足更高的业务需求。」然而四天后，当公司准备将抗逆转录病毒药物的数据重新提交给世卫组织时，朱内贾却在一封抄送给坦皮斯特的电子邮件中重申公司的真正策略：「我们已经相当成功地阻止了世卫组织审查我们以往的稳定性数据。」他接着补充道，「我们最不希望的就是，他们再对德瓦斯做一次视察，我们要赶在那之前彻底解决所有的流程和验证问题。」

但将生产迁到帕奥恩塔萨希布远非完美的解决方案。对于公司的有些药物，新的研究不可能赶在新的注册日期之前完成。就像一名高管在一封电子邮件中询问的那样，他们应该怎么应付这个「过渡时期」，此时监管者要求提交新的数据，但他们还没有将数据准备好。如果现有的数据来自德瓦斯工厂，「我们又该如何将它们用在帕奥恩塔萨希布的申请文件中呢？」一位同事这样回复：「请打电话来，我可以解答你的疑问。」此人的解答几乎肯定属于「过渡期欺诈」，也就是暂时把德瓦斯的旧数据当作帕奥恩塔萨希布的新数据使用。

不过，当兰伯西准备在帕奥恩塔萨希布开始新药检测并将全世界最重要的监管者引到这家新工厂时，它也不希望留下任何不确定因素。如果开展正规检测，药品批次就可能失效，配方也可能显得不稳定，那将是最大的不确定因素。要查清药品为什么失效、不稳定是困难的，而且代价昂贵。遵循良好生产规范之所以费力，就是因为需要用无数个步骤才能使一个不确定的过程更加确定。如果真的要检测药物，那么该怎么对结果进行最佳控制呢？该如何介入每一次检测，从而产生完美的数据呢？

兰伯西想出一个相当巧妙而隐蔽的办法。它到底有多么隐蔽，很大程度上取决于下一个走进工厂的美国药监局调查员是谁。那人是只看到光鲜的表面就会满意，还是会尽责地将零散的线索拼成一幅完整的图像？到场的是哪种调查员，这是公司掌控不了的。

但就在拉金·库马尔向兰伯西的董事们做了那次倒霉的报告之后，公司却交上了好运 —— 下一个来喜马偕尔邦考察帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂的美国药监局调查员将是穆拉里达拉·伽维尼（Muralidhara B. Gavini）博士。

在美国药监局，穆拉里达拉·伽维尼被大家称作「迈克」，他在一件很重要的事上与众不同：他不仅愿意而且乐意到印度去做海外视察，像他这样的调查员可不多。

美国药监局的多数调查员都不愿去印度，特别是在从出差归来的同事那里听到各种故事之后：印度气候酷热，雨水不断，交通状况令人痛苦，沿着坑坑洼洼的破旧公路去遥远的工厂视察有好几个小时的车程，到哪里都要担心因为喝了不干净的水或吃了受污染的食物而生病，因此不得不在旅行箱里塞满花生酱和麦片棒。艰难的旅途在美国药监局引起了一场越来越大的危机。

从理论上说，对于每一家为美国市场生产药物原料的工厂，美国药监局都要尽量做到大约每两年视察一次，无论那家工厂是在马里兰州，还是在孟买。但实际上，美国药监局的海外视察频率更接近于十年一次，而且积压的国外药厂申请数正快速增长。对于派谁去视察海外工厂以及如何支付全部费用，美国药监局并没有明确的方案。到后来它实在走投无路，干脆尝试起了远程视察：由被查的工厂拍摄自家生产设施的录像。这个录像视察提案的理由是「资源日益缺乏」。

在这样一个严重缺乏志愿者的体系中，伽维尼就成了极吃香的人选。当时海得拉巴周围地区已经发展起来，视察工作使他有机会回到故乡。伽维尼是在海得拉巴以南的贡土尔长大的。但把他派去那里没有违反美国药监局的任何规章，部分是因为当时还没有那么多规章。但这确实违反了一条基本原则。正如伽维尼的一位同事后来所说的那样：「绝不能派人去他的家乡。这是监管原则的第 101 条。」因为这样的安排可能产生腐败和妥协。但伽维尼却急不可待地想回家看看。

他第一次离开印度是 1972 年去美国阿肯色大学念化学博士。对当时的他来说，美国这个国家和费耶特维尔这座城市都是陌生的环境。但他的研究做得十分出色，并因此在马萨诸塞州的伍兹霍尔海洋研究所谋得一个职位，他在那里继续本来的研究，追踪雨水中的钚同位素。在伍兹霍尔期间，他在安大略湖底的沉积物中找到了微量锔元素，并在美国化学学会的一次会议上报告了这个发现。他不知道的是，他揭露的是一座秘密核设施的排放物。由于对方发起反诉，他的科研生涯结束了。

接下来，有三个孩子要抚养的他在一家实验室检测公司工作了 10 年，后来管理层变动，逼得他再度求职。1996 年，他自愿拿七成薪水，加入美国药监局的新泽西州办公室。每年拿 35 000 美元，职责是视察奶牛牧场、寻找牛海绵状脑病（疯牛病）的痕迹。他回忆说，他这样一个拥有博士学位和 10 年私营部门工作经验的人，在同事眼中成了「怪胎」。1999 年，他被提拔，去美国药监局的药物评估和研究中心（Center for Drug Evaluation and Research，缩写 CDER）做了一名合规官员。

伽维尼虽然在费耶特维尔感到手足无措，在美国药监局也受到排挤，但他在印度却成了个大人物。第一，他有博士学位，这一点在印度会自动获得尊重；第二，他还代表世界上权力最大的监管机构。大部分时候，他都独自去工厂视察，用他自己的话说，是一支「单人军队」。只需要他一个人，就能决定是否批准一家工厂向美国出口药物，而他的判断并没有明确界定的标准。

美国国内的视察向来遵守清晰的流程：调查员会不打招呼来到美国工厂，为了追查数据的来源和去向，他们想待多久就待多久。就像美国药监局调查员何塞·埃尔南德斯所说：「我们进去，亮出徽章，然后通知他们开始视察。」调查员和被视察的场地之间的关系也很清楚：不能有关系。一位调查员说过：「新泽西的同事连一杯咖啡都不喝。」

但是海外视察的规章就不同了，往好了说也是浑水一潭。美国药监局在海外的原则是不起冲突，免得外国政府卷入，引起国际事件。比起对峙，他们更加重视外交。美国药监局会在视察的几周甚至几个月前就通知对方，然后被视察的公司作为调查员的接待方和旅行社，帮他们预订酒店和地面交通工具。这一点很对伽维尼的胃口。

他采取的视察风格是合作式的。他将自己视为一名搭档，负责教育被视察的公司什么是健全的品质体系。一位同事指出：「他的行事方式更像一名顾问。」伽维尼认为，美国药监局和被视察的公司追求相同的目标。「我们并不是坐在谈判桌的两边。」他说，「品质是我们的共同追求。」

他尽量帮助公司改进技术。他教导他们如何正确地清洁生产设备，并对他们强调「常识」。他说，这个产业「跟我学了太多」。他个人评价每次视察的标准是「我是否为公司做出了积极贡献？最终的结果应该是积极的」。事实也真是如此。海得拉巴的制药部门在他的关照下不断成长，大量产出有效成分，并最终成为印度的原料药之都。

伽维尼每天在工作上投入 10 到 12 个小时。他鄙视那些工作时间较短，或者视察结束几个月之后才提交报告的同事。然而同事偶尔陪他一起视察时，又会对所见感到惊愕：他和被视察的公司竟是如此亲密；他和公司高管们直接沟通，或面谈或打电话；他还常常放那些公司一马。他甚至会把监管报告（称为「483 报告」）的草稿交给公司过目，然后才正式上交。

而在伽维尼看来，美国药监局的保密工作毫无必要。他说：「我不知道美国药监局的调查员为什么要把一切都闷在肚子里。我不管写什么都会（和被视察的公司）讨论。」这也使得公司有机会影响他的视察结论。公司只要保证会改正问题，伽维尼就觉得合格了。在 2003 年的一份视察报告中，他甚至记录了一家工厂的总经理是如何在电话中保证改进的，听到这个保证，他就觉得「满意」了。

但这种口头担保并不利于改善药物品质 —— 至少美国政府问责局（U.S. Government Accountability Office，缩写 GAO）1998 年的一份报告是这样认为的，那是在伽维尼开始视察工作的两年前。那份报告抨击美国药监局仅根据「国外生产商的改进承诺」就下调视察评审级别，并且「美国药监局很少对这些场地重新视察，以确认国外生产商是否真的纠正了严重的生产失误」。

伽维尼后来解释，他不喜欢把自己的同胞当成罪犯。但是随着海得拉巴制药产业的飞速成长，并且其他美国药监局调查员在伽维尼曾经批准的场地查出严重违规行为，他作为一名马虎调查员的名声也传播开来。在同事中间，他成了典型的「无行动指示调查员」，因为他最常得出的结论就是「无行动指示」。

2004 年 12 月 17 日，兰伯西的高管们迎来一个好消息：他们熟悉的调查员迈克·伽维尼来帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂了。他是来做预审视察的，目的是确认这家工厂有能力为美国在非洲的艾滋病治疗项目生产两种抗艾滋病药 —— 拉米夫定和齐多夫定。

公司对他的到来并不意外。根据美国药监局海外视察的一贯流程，这次视察已经提前几周通知了，公司也参与了安排。在这次视察的总结报告中，伽维尼写道，「公司安排了往返工厂的交通」，还「提供了住宿」。

伽维尼在公司待了五天。在带领他参观工厂的高管中，有许多之前都因为缺乏数据在恐慌中互发邮件。这些邮件伽维尼一封都没看到。在他的视察报告中，他指出公司的批次记录中的一些指标不明确，清洁流程也不明确。不过他还是对公司的稳定性检测项目做了毫无保留的赞赏，这个项目将药物暴露在不同的温度和湿度条件下，以观察它们在不同环境中的降解速度以及保质期。他写道：「进出变温室的稳定性检测样本得到了监控，样本库也得到了妥善保养。」

伽维尼会得出这个结论，一定是因为他从七个月前刚刚安装的一台热实验室牌稳定性冰箱旁径直走了过去。这台大型步入式冰箱常年维持在 4℃。它的用途没有在公司向美国药监局提交的任何一份申请中出现。要是伽维尼打开过冰箱，他就会发现几百瓶塞在纸板箱中没有检测记录的样本。

为什么兰伯西要使用这台冰箱？这将是接下来几年争议最大、分歧最严重的问题之一。但在当时，伽维尼没有提出任何疑问。对兰伯西一众紧张的高管来说，他是一位理想的调查员。对于药物检测方面的不当措施，他要么发现不了，要么就没注意。

意料之中，他的视察只发现了很少的问题。他给工厂开了健康无疫证明书，并认定它「大体遵循」了现行良好生产规范。他的结论又是无行动指示。

## 0302. Map of the World

AUGUST 2005

Gurgaon, India

The heat and humidity of monsoon season rolled in, pelting the house with rain. On increasingly fitful nights, as the diesel generator rumbled, Dinesh Thakur lay awake with a map of the world in his head. It was divided into Ranbaxy’s five major markets: the United States and Canada, Europe, Latin America, India, and ROW (rest of the world). Night after night, he visualized the reams of data he had prepared about the drugs in each market, every data set spelling out a hazard to patients that was almost certainly continuing.

The HIV drugs bound for Africa troubled Thakur the most. He knew they were bad. They had high impurities, degraded easily, and would be useless at best in the hot, humid Zone IV conditions of sub-Saharan Africa. They would be taken by the world’s poorest patients, who had almost no medical infrastructure and no recourse for complaints. The injustice made Thakur livid.

Before he’d arrived at Ranbaxy, he assumed that a pill was a pill, manufactured identically for all the regions of the world. Publicly, the company made this claim. It stated that it keyed all its standards across world markets to the most rigorous — those of the United States. But Thakur now knew that the company reserved its worst drugs for countries with little to no regulation, where the chances of getting caught were minuscule.

The FDA, which was now monitoring the quality of all PEPFAR drugs, obviously had no idea this was going on. A month after Thakur resigned, the agency approved Ranbaxy’s Paonta Sahib plant to make AIDS drugs for the PEPFAR program. And in early August, the World Health Organization had restored the company’s AIDS drugs — the ones tested at Vimta — to its prequalified list, to the great relief of AIDS activists who wanted to ensure a low-cost supply of lifesaving drugs.

After leaving Ranbaxy in late April 2005, Thakur tried to convince himself that the company’s medicine was no longer his problem. But his immediate relief had given way to anxiety. He was jobless and piecing together haphazard consulting work as the family’s savings dwindled. Sonal was pregnant with their second child. He mentioned nothing to her about his larger concerns. But night after night he found himself wondering what, if anything, he could do about Ranbaxy’s deceptions. Did he have an obligation to expose them?

The incessant questions took him back to the nighttime stories — and daytime riots — of his childhood. Thakur grew up one hundred miles north of Hyderabad in the lush agricultural town of Nizamabad, where sugarcane, turmeric, and maize grew in abundance. Three generations of Thakurs lived in the family’s ancestral home. His mother was a homemaker. His father, a lawyer, was a civil litigator who did more pro-bono than paid work.

They lived comfortable if modest lives.「Money was not a driver in any sense,」said Thakur. But education was. Thakur and his younger brother and sister were taught by nuns at a strict Catholic school that emphasized discipline and memorization. Each day they took a rickshaw to school along one of the town’s two major roads.

His grandmother, Amba Bai — a bespectacled slip of a woman who wore simple saris — made the biggest impression on Thakur. At home, the principal entertainment for the children were the stories she told every night, drawn from India’s two most famous epic poems, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The stories were teeming with characters facing long odds: righteous kings, scheming relatives, fantastical gods, monkey armies.

Each night the characters confronted essential questions of right and wrong and how to live their lives. Would they grab power or choose justice? Would they descend on a road to the underworld or ascend into the light? And while demons and goddesses clashed in his nighttime stories, the real world outside his door was also replete with conflict. In that postcolonial powder keg, perceived slights led to frequent strife between Hindus and Muslims that sometimes led to full-scale riots just outside his door.

His father frequently waded into these skirmishes, racing out to the street to mediate.「I would always ask him, ‘Why are you going out there? It’s not our problem,’」Thakur recalled.「His answer was always, ‘When you see something that’s wrong you have to make sure that you do whatever you can.’」Often, his father would return with cuts and bruises from his peacemaking trips, to the dismay of Thakur’s mother.「She used to absolutely hate him going out there,」Thakur recalled, and inevitably the same discussions ensued:「This is not your problem. They don’t listen to you anyway!」But there was no stopping his father.

For young Thakur, the moral dilemmas his father faced were subtler than those playing out in his grandmother’s stories. If a bad situation is「not your fight,」then what is your obligation? His father’s answer was clear. As a senior lawyer in town, he believed that he had a duty to intervene and serve as a liaison between the people and the justice system, however flawed.

Thakur absorbed this lesson but found it difficult to implement. In eighth grade, one of his friends got suspended from a soccer game for an infraction that wasn’t his fault. Thakur appealed to the physical education teacher on his friend’s behalf but made no headway. So he took his appeal directly to the headmaster. In front of the entire team, Thakur told him that the physical education teacher was being punitive and his friend did not deserve the suspension. The headmaster slapped Thakur across the face and told him never to complain about any of his teachers.「The headmaster did not want to see a teacher challenged by an eighth-grader,」Thakur realized afterward.

The school’s value system, and that of the culture at large, prioritized deference to authority above simple fairness. Thakur rejected this doctrine. He maintained his own value system as he grew into adulthood. His father had gone into the streets to reason with hostile neighbors, with little thought of the dangers to himself. But for a problem that sprawled all over the world, where were Thakur’s streets? With whom could he reason? Thakur knew that others had detected fraud at Ranbaxy, but he believed he was one of the few insiders who understood its full extent. And among that small circle, none had expressed any inclination to address the crime.

Some had even profited from it. His old boss, Barbhaiya, had been given a hefty compensation package on his departure, which Thakur and Kumar believed was to ensure his silence.「The systems in India are so corrupting that even if you are not corrupt, you get corrupted,」Thakur would later say. The middle course for the honest man was to do nothing, which seemed to Thakur to be a version of complicity. There was the option to speak up, but honesty came with peril.

Whistleblowers in India faced mortal risks. Just eighteen months earlier, a project director at the National Highways Authority of India had exposed massive corruption in a highway building project. He was found shot to death by the side of a road. While his death provoked national outrage, it was not all that unusual — especially since whistleblowers in India had no legal protection. As for Ranbaxy, the powerful Singh family had a reputation for being bullies. Their internecine family feuds had even involved gangs of paid thugs, according to published news accounts.

It would have made the most sense for Thakur to do nothing. Being a good Samaritan could backfire in ways that were hard to predict, as it had when he’d rescued the drunk pedestrian from the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road. That had led to a police officer attempting to frame him as part of a shakedown. The lesson was to keep moving and mind his own business, as his driver Vijay had urged him to do. But Thakur rarely considered the societal norms when deciding whether to act in a way he considered just. He had an absolute set of ethical coordinates that dictated his actions.

On the morning of August 15, 2005, four months after submitting his resignation, he woke up determined to do something. It was India’s Independence Day, a national holiday celebrating the day fifty-eight years earlier when the country had gained its freedom from British rule. Thakur wanted his own liberation from the concerns that had dogged him for months.

He descended to his basement office and opened a Yahoo email account that he had created while weighing his options. Posing as a low-level company scientist and using intentionally broken English, he wrote to officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Health Organization. He stated,「Ranbaxy Laboratories in India is fooling you to get their product on the market with fake data.」He claimed that Ranbaxy was forcing him to falsify data:「I cannot sleep at night knowing that these drugs will be used to cure sick patients in Africa. At best, this drug are ineffective and at worst, they cause adverse reaction and kill people.」He had sent his email using a pseudonym. In choosing one, he reached for a name that invoked power and prestige, in the hope of drawing attention to his cause. He had created an email account using the name of Ranbaxy’s heir apparent, Malvinder Singh.

Each night after that, he went down to his basement computer to check his email, expecting some response. The wait was excruciating. And each day that passed without a response brought a fresh round of pain and self-doubt. He suspected that his email had not been authoritative or detailed enough to penetrate the bureaucracy. So he wrote again, this time more pointedly, to half a dozen FDA officials:「I fear for the poor people in Africa who buy these fake medication from WHO and PEPFAR in the hope of getting better, but no, they do not get better, they get died.」Silence.

He continued to write, adding details and even attaching documents. The silence persisted. A week later, he wrote back to FDA officials, still in the voice of a lowly bench scientist, but this time with more detail.「Ranbaxy management, including the CEO, Head of business and Head of QA systematically ask people in the lab and plant to fabricate data to support stability. There is no data to support shelf life and the formulation you now approve will be degrade in Zone IV conditions in Southern Africa before it gets to the patients. The formulation is worthless. It produce no results.」

Thakur was relentless — and disappointed. He’d thought that if he could only overcome his fear of speaking up, the world would respond and regulators would descend on the company. But no one seemed to care. Over the course of several days, polite but vague responses trickled back. A secretary from the World Health Organization wrote that the officials he’d contacted were out of the office, but his message had been received「and will be dealt with in due course.」

After two weeks of waiting, he put aside the ruse of writing in broken English and sent a message directly to FDA commissioner Lester Crawford. In a forceful and urgent email, he alleged that Ranbaxy was selling「untested, spurious, ineffective medication.」He noted that he’d written repeatedly to Crawford’s subordinates and had included「documents, e-mail messages exchanged between the senior management of this company, including the CEO.」He finally used the word that had come to him months earlier, as he unearthed the company’s misdeeds.「I plead with you,」he wrote,「to put a stop to this crime.」

This time his message broke through. Two days later, Thakur got a detailed email back from Edwin Rivera-Martinez, then chief of investigations and preapproval compliance in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Rivera-Martinez stated that he had Thakur’s「e-mail communications of August 15th, 17th, 27th and 31st」and asked Thakur if he would consent to a conference call. Thakur had planned to stay hidden. He had initially expected to set regulators on the trail but limit his own involvement. It had not actually occurred to him that he would have to do more than that.

The two went back and forth. Thakur declined the call, citing a risk to his family, but attached more documents. Rivera-Martinez responded, reassuring him that he could remain anonymous.「From your emails, we got the impression that you believe that people are being killed by fake medications and you want to stop this from happening,」Rivera-Martinez wrote.「. . . without opening a telephone dialogue with you, our investigation may be significantly hampered.」

Thakur was wary. He wrote back:「Will this conversation be recorded? Who will be with you when we talk? Is there any personal liability for me if I talk to you? What protection do I have from prosecution? What we are discussing here is a crime that was committed by the company.」Rivera-Martinez wrote back that it was far more effective to gather relevant officials for a conference call than to go back and forth on email. He also assured Thakur that his identity would be held in strictest confidence, unless the matter went to court and the FDA was required to divulge his identity.

Hesitantly, Thakur consented to the call. But still wanting to maintain control of the interaction, he tried to school Rivera-Martinez on the best and most secure way to set up the conference call.「Do you have access to publicly available VOIP applications?」he asked in one email.「I mean apps like GoogleTalk or SKYPE? In order to use either of these apps, you only need a microphone and speakers on your computer.」He then sent links for the FDA official to download. But the FDA had its own technology — and its own way of operating.

Thakur ended up phoning in to the agency, as instructed. The conference call lasted about ninety minutes. Rivera-Martinez, who was formal and persuasive, gently asked the questions while staffers from different divisions of the agency listened in. There was a special agent, Douglas Loveland, from the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. Dr. Mike Gavini sat in, as did a compliance officer, Karen Takahashi. They wanted to know where Thakur had gotten his information, how confident he was about it, and what some of the documents he’d shared meant.

In an email afterward, Thakur wrote to Rivera-Martinez, sounding almost disappointed in advance:「If I am successful in proving to you that the medicines that this company sells worldwide are not of the quality the US FDA mandates, I will be satisfied. Whether you choose to take this up further is completely your prerogative. I personally hope you would.」

But in the coming months, Thakur was not satisfied at all. To him, the wrongdoing was black-and-white. He had given proof and expected action. And yet ten days after the conference call, the FDA announced that it had approved Ranbaxy’s application for the first generic pediatric AIDS drug for the U.S. market, zidovudine.「Given all the data you have in your possession today about the criminal activities of this company in registering ARVs with fabricated data, I am confused how the USFDA could give such an approval,」Thakur wrote to Rivera-Martinez.「Does this mean that you have concluded your investigation and decided that Ranbaxy is not guilty of these crimes?」

The bureaucrat wrote back that because the drug had been approved before Thakur made contact, only actual proof of fraud could reverse the decision. Thakur was staggered. He’d emailed the agency reams of internal data and communications that clearly showed top-level executives conspiring to alter test results. If that didn’t count for proof of fraud, what did? It was a question with no easy answer, as he would come to learn.

Over the weeks that followed, the communications between Thakur and Rivera-Martinez unfolded as a cordial, slow-motion, arm-twisting duel, fought almost entirely over email. Rivera-Martinez coaxed a reluctant Thakur to give up more information and be more patient; Thakur goaded and needled Rivera-Martinez to make the FDA take action more quickly and aggressively.

On October 6, Rivera-Martinez sent an email asking Thakur「urgently to call regarding several Agency press releases in the works.」Thakur did not get the message in time. The agency announced two more approvals for Ranbaxy: a diabetes drug, glimepiride, and an antiseizure drug, gabapentin. Despondent, Thakur emailed Rivera-Martinez back, noting that he’d provided as much information as he could,「at great risk to me and my family.」He went on:「The actions of the agency really worry me, since it appears to me that you have chosen to largely ignore the evidence I have given you. . . . If you have already concluded that this company has done nothing wrong, please tell me and at least I would have the satisfaction that I have done my duty.」

He wanted to give up and several times declared as much to Rivera-Martinez. In the wake of the October approvals, he sent the resignation letter written by his old boss Raj Kumar, and his last communications with the CEO, Brian Tempest. Thakur called it「a final gesture. . . . The ball is in your court now Mr. Rivera-Martinez, I cannot do anything more for you or the Agency. I will wait and watch your actions . . . before initiating any further dialogue with you.」

But the dialogue continued. Thakur had remained anonymous. Those in the agency referred to him simply as「M,」or「Mr. M,」short for the name he’d used to first make contact with them, Malvinder Singh. And though Thakur had shared many documents, he had withheld the one that mattered most: the Self-Assessment Report (SAR) that Kumar had presented to board directors. That document was radioactive inside the company and would lead directly back to Thakur. On November 2, Rivera-Martinez wrote back,「During our teleconference . . . you mentioned a risk assessment document that you were asked to prepare while you were at Ranbaxy. . . . A copy of this document may be what we need to focus our investigation.」

The request sparked another concern. Though Thakur had done nothing wrong, he had no lawyer and no immunity.「As you have seen from our two-month long association, my only interest in this is to protect the people who pay for the medicines this company makes,」he wrote to Rivera-Martinez. Before he could share more documents,「I need to have immunity from prosecution,」Thakur warned.

Rivera-Martinez tried to explain that the FDA had no power to confer immunity. But he arranged a teleconference with an FDA criminal investigator who was able to reassure Thakur. With that remaining obstacle removed, Thakur sent Rivera-Martinez the document that Ranbaxy’s CEO had been so intent on destroying: the PowerPoint Kumar showed to a subcommittee of the board of directors. The agency now had its fullest picture of a company that was fraudulent to its core.

Though Thakur didn’t know it at the time, the FDA had found his information credible and had been moving to confirm it. In October 2005, less than two months after he first contacted the agency, Rivera-Martinez’s division had sent a request to the Division of Field Investigations to perform high-priority inspections at two of Ranbaxy’s main manufacturing plants, Dewas and Paonta Sahib.

The five-page assignment memo set out a host of alleged frauds for which the inspectors needed to look. Rivera-Martinez requested a face-to-face meeting with the chosen investigators before they left on their trip. The memorandum also recommended that the investigators collect any documents on the day they requested them, noting that the「informant said that the firm has fabricated documents overnight during inspections.」

The agency needed an unvarnished view of the company. In January 2006, however, Thakur urgently relayed to Rivera-Martinez what he had learned from former colleagues: the senior leadership of the company was「camped out in the plant locations, both at Paonta Sahib and at Dewas,」he wrote, warning of「a massive cover-up effort underway to ‘produce’」any documentation that agency investigators might request. Given what Ranbaxy seemed to know about the upcoming inspection, Thakur demanded to know whether the investigation had been compromised in some way. The answer stunned him: Ranbaxy had been notified months in advance that the regulators were coming, because overseas companies always were. It’s the way things were done.

## 0303. The Pharaoh of Pharma

JANUARY 19, 2006

Gurgaon, India

Five months after Thakur first contacted the FDA, Malvinder Mohan Singh succeeded Brian Tempest as managing director and CEO of Ranbaxy, returning the company to the founding family’s leadership. Malvinder was just thirty-three and knew little about the science of medicine. But his own personality and upbringing, as well as his family’s background, made him seem well suited to a competitive industry with a social mission at its core.

His father, Parvinder, had been austere, restricting everything from candy to conversation. He had indoctrinated his sons into their maternal grandfather’s spiritual organization, Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB), from an early age. Parvinder often took his sons and his wife, Nimmi, to the Beas community, where they volunteered as laborers. Though Parvinder sent his children to elite schools, they had few of the indulgences of their peers. At college, the children of the wealthy drove fancy cars, got extravagant allowances, and ate dinner at five-star hotels. By contrast, Malvinder took public transportation, commuted to college by way of Delhi Transport Corporation buses, got an allowance of less than `$10` a month, and ate street food.

Though the Singhs emphasized the ascetic values that had long been central to the family, Malvinder had always been a corporate-titan-in-training, who developed expensive taste and an air of mastery as he grew older. He had been introduced to Ranbaxy’s inner workings while he was a boy. His father would let him browse company reports, hoping he would glean industry trends. During school breaks, Malvinder would tag along with Ranbaxy drug representatives on sales calls to doctors and chemists, riding pillion on the back of their scooters.

He assumed his new role as CEO with ease. His management style was brash, competitive, and ambitious. Malvinder immediately looked around the globe for opportunity. The fawning Indian business press dubbed him「the Pharaoh of Pharma」and hailed him as an「out-of-the-box decision-maker.」Inside Ranbaxy, some viewed him as petulant and immature. He was preoccupied with his own ranking on the Forbes list of India’s 40 richest people. He and his brother Shivinder, with `$1.6` billion in assets combined, had fallen from tenth in 2004 to nineteenth in 2005. This year was shaping up to be even worse, which Malvinder seemed to blame on a lack of employee loyalty. When told that a division wasn’t making its numbers, he would yell at employees,「I want profit!」He later explained to a journalist that his passion for Ranbaxy’s collective mission, to become an international research-based pharmaceutical company, drove his conduct, adding,「We too had a sharp focus on topline and bottomline, which is true for any business organization.」

Malvinder and Shivinder both drove $100,000 champagne-colored Mercedes S-class sedans and collected art and photography. They liked fine clothes, and were prized clients of one of Delhi’s most upscale tailors, Vaish at Rivoli, which boasted of serving the「maharajas of business.」Each morning, Malvinder and his brother, who worked in a different part of the family’s businesses, coordinated their outfits, making sure not to wear the same thing to the same meetings. The listeners of radio station Fever 104 FM voted Malvinder among Delhi’s most stylish, and he even sat as the judge of a Miss India competition.

Interacting with employees, Malvinder liked to quote from his favorite book, The Art of War, the 2,500-year-old Chinese military treatise that he viewed as required reading for anyone in business. Perhaps this was not surprising, since the disputes within his own family over real estate and corporate assets resembled warfare.

For years, the extended Singh clan had lived in the heart of New Delhi at one of the world’s most exclusive addresses: Aurangzeb Road, where mansions — or「bungalows,」as the residents call them — sit on acres of planted gardens behind impregnable walls. In 2006, Malvinder’s mother, Nimmi, and his uncle, Analjit, both of whom lived on the multi-acre family property in separate bungalows, filed complaints with the police against each other. Nimmi alleged that she’d caught Analjit erecting an unlawful wall; in response, he’d hired「huge and bulky」men armed with axes and hammers to intimidate her.「I was attacked, threatened, physically abused by goons, who said that not one member of the family of Parvinder Singh, including grandchildren will be alive,」she alleged to the police. Analjit filed his own complaint against Nimmi and Malvinder, alleging criminal intimidation and assault.

The「Ranbaxy Family Feud」hit the Indian press as the next sensational chapter in the almost two-decade saga of claims and counterclaims between family members over Bhai Mohan Singh’s division of his empire and property. In desperation, Nimmi turned to her sons for help. In less than a month, Malvinder and his uncle announced that the family had reached an amicable settlement. Both sides withdrew their lawsuits, of which there were over thirty going back to the 1990s. Malvinder came off as the family diplomat and peacemaker.

He appeared to be a「spiritual young man,」said an Indian journalist who knew the family well. Eight times a year, Malvinder returned to the small town of Beas in Punjab to visit his guru from the RSSB organization, which focused on reuniting man’s soul with God through meditation. His spiritual upbringing, and his family’s core values of austerity, became part of his brand. Reflecting on his childhood in an interview for Duke University’s business school alumni magazine, Malvinder spoke for himself and his brother:「We agree we were born into an illustrious family, however, we were fortunate to have an environment that was simple, pious, and spiritual. . . . Our family values centered on hard work, high ethics, equity of relationships and humility.」Just six weeks after assuming the leadership of Ranbaxy, Malvinder would need to bring all the enlightened values he liked to promote into an increasingly fraught conflict.

On February 20, 2006, two of the FDA’s most experienced investigators, Regina Brown and Robert Horan, arrived at the Paonta Sahib manufacturing plant in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. Though they had only six days, they were armed with a confidential assignment memo from Edwin Rivera-Martinez’s division: five pages outlining the frauds alleged by Dinesh Thakur.

Despite Ranbaxy’s lead time and preparation, the investigators found troubling lapses. Raw data was routinely discarded. Patient complaints went uninvestigated. But their most important finding was the one that Dr. Mike Gavini had seen and walked right past fourteen months earlier: the unregistered walk-in refrigerator, set to 4 degrees Celsius, and another one like it that had been added since then. The contents of the refrigerators made no sense. Inside were cardboard boxes stuffed with bottles of unlabeled drug samples.「There were no counts for the items, no test status and no reason for storage given for the over 1000 items on the refrigerator inventory and over 150 items on the second refrigerator inventory,」the investigators noted in their report.

What were the refrigerators for? One drug vial inside was labeled 30 degrees Celsius. Was it in the wrong refrigerator by accident, as Ranbaxy would later claim? Or was every sample in the wrong place on purpose? The investigators asked for a log of the fridges’ contents but were told that none was kept. Later, the company claimed that it did maintain a list of the drugs but had not provided it to the FDA「because we did not understand FDA to have requested it.」

The fridges seemed an unlikely hub of fraud. But in trying to explain away unlabeled samples in unregistered refrigerators, the company got tangled up in shifting explanations. Ranbaxy first claimed that the samples were for「regulatory filings globally,」but its refrigeration had no impact on stability tests. In a seeming contradiction, company officials separately claimed that the bottles were「‘test-on-demand control samples’ used only for ‘reference purposes’ but not used for creating any [official] data.」The FDA noted that「it remains unclear to us what these ‘stand-by’ samples are actually used for.」The investigators also took samples of Sotret, Ranbaxy’s generic version of the anti-acne drug Accutane. The FDA found that the drug degraded far in advance of its expiration date and had lower-than-expected potency.

The following week, Brown and Horan set out to inspect Dewas, one of Ranbaxy’s most troubled manufacturing plants. Mike Gavini had last inspected it in December 2004 and found nothing wrong. This time dozens of Ranbaxy officials trailed behind Brown and Horan, scrambling to respond to their questions. The investigators discovered that Ranbaxy had been discarding original electronic data and had changed the policy to retain it only weeks before their arrival. The investigators even found themselves explaining the basics of good manufacturing: that raw data should not be changed「after the fact or outside of the laboratory operation by someone who was not performing the test.」

Horan and Brown had done their jobs. They’d found critical deficiencies that pointed to much larger issues. The findings were serious, and the company’s explanations were too inconsistent to fend off the FDA. In June 2006, the agency issued a warning letter to the Paonta Sahib plant that looked to the world like a severe rebuke. It chronicled a list of failings: not retaining「analytical raw data, undocumented stability sample test intervals, the unclear purpose of ‘standby samples’ [the drugs in the fridge], the inadequate staffing and resources in the stability laboratory,」and the FDA’s lab results for the anti-acne drug Sotret, which revealed that the drug degraded and lost potency. The agency said that it would not consider any new applications for Paonta Sahib’s drugs until the company demonstrated corrections.

This should have been a serious checkmate, since the company had moved manufacturing of its most lucrative and important products for the United States and PEPFAR to Paonta Sahib. But the FDA’s action did nothing to stop all the drugs that were already on the market, drugs from the plant that had already been approved, or drug applications submitted from other sites. Just weeks before the FDA issued the warning letter, Rivera-Martinez sounded almost plaintive when he wrote to Thakur:「We are under a lot of pressure to approve Ranbaxy’s generic version of Pravastatin [a cholesterol-lowering drug] when the patent exclusivity runs out this Thursday.」In short, the bureaucrat’s hands were tied by the agency’s inexorable machinery: to keep approving drug applications almost no matter what.

Thakur had done as much as he could. Despondent that the FDA was still greenlighting Ranbaxy’s drugs, he tried to focus on his family. Sonal had just given birth to their second child, a girl they named Mohavi. She would be their good luck charm, Thakur told his wife. Yet even as Sonal lay in a private hospital in Gurgaon with her arms around her new daughter, both of them receiving excellent care, she worried. Four days in the hospital would cost a major sum. The Thakurs no longer had health insurance and were living from savings. They had gone from being well situated in the corporate world to a fragile, uncertain existence.

Thakur had not been able to find sufficient employment in India. The consulting work, and the income, came in dribs and drabs. Within a few months of Mohavi’s birth, he was finally offered a job with Infosys Technologies that would require him to travel heavily and relocate to the United States, almost full-time. He felt he had no choice but to take it and tried to convince Sonal to come with him, even petitioning her mother, but Sonal resolved to remain in India with the children.

She had always prided herself on her independence. She was neither helpless nor without resources. Yes, she was in an arranged marriage, had two small children, and wasn’t working. But she had been raised by a mother with a master’s degree in Sanskrit, who had insisted that her daughter get a superb education and be able to make her own way in the world. Sonal had done just that. Once she’d gotten her master’s degree in computer engineering and worked as a software engineer at the Carrier Corporation, she enjoyed the most companionable span of her marriage. She and Thakur had worked and provided for Ishan, side by side.

But the day her husband prepared to leave India for the United States felt like the darkest of her life. Though she had chosen to stay in India, she felt alone nonetheless. Her mother and father lived over eight hundred miles to the south, in Raipur. That morning, unable to find Ishan, she went down the basement stairs to Thakur’s office. She found her husband weeping, with his arms wrapped around Ishan, trying to conceal his heartbreak from his wife. She had never seen Thakur cry. Nor had Ishan, who was asking in a puzzled voice,「Why are you crying, Daddy?」

Taking in the scene, Sonal called out,「Don’t! Dinesh, don’t do that in front of Ishan.」Among all her inchoate fears, the one she fixed on was that the boy might somehow be scarred by her husband’s sorrow. Sonal still had no idea what her husband had embarked on with the FDA, yet the stress of it had settled over their marriage like a fog.

There had always been a divide between them. Even under the best of circumstances, Thakur kept a wall around himself. He was not accustomed to having confidants and had revealed his anonymous contact with the FDA to only one person, his friend and former employee Dinesh Kasthuril. Kasthuril, who assumed that Thakur had just tipped off the agency, thought that was「the right thing to do.」He had no idea that his friend was in ongoing dialogue with the FDA. Had he known, he might have expressed his doubt that anyone in India could personally take on a corporation and succeed.

Thakur was doubting the wisdom of what he’d done. He’d put his family at risk, and he feared for their safety. The Singhs had a reputation for threatening people, and he knew too many of their company’s secrets. Thakur expanded the hours of the security guard outside their house to twenty-four hours a day. He told Sonal that he’d done it because he’d be away. Meanwhile, his disappointment only intensified as he waited for definitive action from the FDA, which seemed either helpless to act or uninterested in doing so.

In all of this, there did seem to be one person who understood what Thakur was going through, shared his goals, and believed in the rightness of what he’d done. Her name was Debbie Robertson, and she was an agent in the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. She wrote to Thakur in January 2006 to explain that she would be his new point of contact at the FDA.

Though Edwin Rivera-Martinez’s division continued to examine whether Ranbaxy was complying with regulations, Robertson’s involvement signaled a new dimension to the case. Her job was to investigate whether Ranbaxy had broken any laws or should face any criminal liability.

Robertson was new to the agency, having arrived in October 2005. But she was a seasoned law enforcement professional who had spent ten years as a criminal investigator at the IRS. As she was junior in the agency, she was handed the matter of Ranbaxy to take another look at it, with the implication that the case was a dog. Robertson was not so sure. As soon as she got in dialogue with「M,」as Thakur was known to the FDA, she was struck by his seriousness and evident intelligence, as well as the significant risks he’d taken in contacting the FDA. In turn, her kind and reassuring emails offered Thakur something that no one else at the agency had given him yet: hope.

Nonetheless, Thakur felt disheartened when he returned to the United States. He’d heard initially from former colleagues that the FDA’s inspections in India had been uneventful, which he feared would spell the end of the road for the agency’s inquiry. But Robertson was reassuring on this point too.「It is actually a good thing that [Ranbaxy] thinks the inspection was uneventful,」she wrote to Thakur.「It means they are not suspicious about anything.」

It had been months since Thakur first contacted the agency. He had watched as the FDA announced one new drug approval after another for Ranbaxy. Debbie Robertson tried to ease his frustration.「Imagine, if you will, that we were able to prove even half of what you have told us,」she wrote to Thakur.「This would bring down the entire corporation. One of the largest in the world.」She added,「To lose on a technicality would be a crime in itself.」As she advised him,「Think of the U.S. corporation Enron and how long that took.」

Thakur wrote back,「Do you believe there will be any concrete action against this company ever? . . . It makes me wonder if all my efforts and troubles were worth anything at all.」

She urged him not to lose hope.「The wheels of justice turn slowly,」she wrote,「but they do turn.」









第十一章

## 世界地图

2005 年 8 月印度古尔冈

雨季的湿热滚滚而来，大雨敲打着房屋。在越来越躁动的夜晚，听着柴油发电机的轰鸣，迪内希·萨库尔躺着无法入睡，脑海中浮现出一张世界地图。地图被划分成了兰伯西的五大市场：美国和加拿大、欧洲、拉丁美洲、印度以及其他地区。一夜又一夜，他在脑海中审视着他就每个市场的药物梳理出的大量数据，每个数据集都代表对患者的一种危害，几乎可以肯定，这些危害仍在持续。

那些要售给非洲的抗艾滋病药物最令萨库尔担忧。他知道它们很糟。它们杂质含量高、易降解，在撒哈拉以南的非洲的湿热环境中将会失效，这还是最好的情况。服用它们的都是世界上最贫穷的患者，他们没有基础的医疗设施，也没有申诉的途径。这种不公令萨库尔怒火中烧。

在来兰伯西之前，他总以为药片就是药片，在世界的哪个区域生产都一样。在公开场合，兰伯西宣称，它在全球所有市场参照的都是最严格市场 —— 美国的标准。但萨库尔现在知道，公司把最差的药物留给了那些监管不严或者没有监管的国家，在那里只有很小的概率会被抓。

美国药监局现在虽然监管着所有总统防艾计划药物的品质，但它显然不知道实情。萨库尔辞职一个月后，美国药监局批准了兰伯西的帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂为总统防艾计划生产抗艾滋病药物。8 月初，世卫组织还将公司的抗艾滋病药物，也就是在维姆塔实验室检测的那些，放回初审合格名单上，这使得希望保证低成本救命药供应的艾滋病活动家们大大松了一口气。

2005 年 4 月底，萨库尔离开兰伯西后，努力说服自己，公司的药物已经与他无关。但是随着时间的推移，离职后的轻松感逐渐被焦虑所取代。他没了工作，只能找些零碎的咨询活计贴补家里不断减少的积蓄。苏娜尔怀了二胎。他担忧的长远问题一句都没对她提。但是夜复一夜，他总忍不住思索自己能做点什么以阻止兰伯西的诈骗。他有义务揭露他们吗？

这些无休止的疑问让他想起童年夜里的睡前故事 —— 以及白天的骚乱。萨库尔成长于海得拉巴以北 100 英里处的一个农业城镇 —— 尼扎马巴德，那里盛产甘蔗、姜黄和玉米。萨库尔一家三代共同生活在祖屋里。他的母亲是位家庭妇女，父亲是一位民事诉讼律师，接的多是公益案子，收费的不多。

一家人的生活简朴但舒适。「金钱绝不是我们生活的动力。」萨库尔说。但教育是。萨库尔和弟弟妹妹在一家严格的天主教学校跟着修女们学习，学校强调的是纪律和背诵。每天，他们都坐着人力车，沿着镇里的两条主要道路中的一条去上学。

他的祖母安葩·巴伊（Amba Bai）身材修长，戴着眼镜，穿着朴素的莎丽，她给萨库尔留下了最深的印象。在家中，孩子们的主要娱乐就是每晚听她讲故事，它们取材于印度最著名的两部史诗 ——《罗摩衍那》（Ramayana

）和《摩诃婆罗多》（Mahabharata

）。故事里有许多面临艰巨挑战的角色：正直的国王，阴险的亲戚，奇幻的众神，还有猴子组成的军队。

每天晚上，这些人物都要面对根本的困惑：什么是对的？什么是错的？人要如何生活？他们是该攫取权力，还是选择正义？是该堕落到一条通向幽冥的路，还是该向上飞升到光明？当恶魔与女神在夜间的故事里交战时，门外的真实世界同样充满冲突。在那个后殖民时代的火药桶里，人与人之间的轻蔑使印度教教徒和伊斯兰教教徒之间频繁发生冲突，有时冲突还会引起大规模骚乱，而这一切就发生在他家的门口。

他的父亲常会介入这些小冲突，跑到街道上去调停。萨库尔回忆道：「我总是问他：‘你为什么要出去呢？这又不关我们的事。'而他总是回答：‘当你看到一件错事，就一定要尽你所能纠正它。'」父亲常常带着伤痕和瘀青从斡旋之旅中归来，母亲被吓坏了。萨库尔回忆说：「她以前很讨厌他出去多管闲事。」每次他回来两人总免不了重复同样的讨论：「这不关你的事。他们反正又不听你的！」然而什么都阻止不了他父亲。

在年轻的萨库尔看来，父亲面临的道德两难的境地要比祖母故事里呈现的那些更加微妙。如果说一个坏的局势「不是你造成的」，那么你有什么义务？父亲的回答很清楚。作为镇上的资深律师，他相信自己有义务调停冲突，并充当人民和司法体制之间的联络人，无论那个体制有多大的缺陷。

萨库尔听进了父亲的教诲，但发现这很难落实。八年级时，他的一个朋友在一场足球比赛中因犯规而被停赛，但实际上犯规的不是他。萨库尔替那个朋友向体育老师申诉，但没有效果。于是他改向校长直接申诉。当着整支球队，他告诉校长体育老师罚得太重，他朋友不该被停赛。然而校长打了萨库尔一个耳光，并告诉他不要讲任何一位老师的坏话。萨库尔后来明白了：「校长不想让一个老师被一个八年级学生质疑。」

不仅是学校的价值体系，就连印度的整体文化，都看重顺从权威而轻视简单的公平。萨库尔厌恶这种教条。在成长过程中，他始终坚持着自己的价值体系。为了给彼此敌对的邻居讲道理，父亲走上街头，很少考虑自身的安危。那么对于一个蔓延全球的问题，萨库尔的街头又在哪里？他又可以和谁理论呢？萨库尔知道，其他人也察觉到了兰伯西的诈骗行径，但他相信自己是少数知道事情全貌的内部人士之一。而在这个小圈子里，谁也没有表现出正视这种罪行的意愿。

其中一些人甚至还从中获利了。他的老上司巴布海亚离职时拿到了丰厚的补偿金，萨库尔和库马尔都相信，那是为了保证他不在外面乱讲话。萨库尔后来说道：「印度的体制太腐败了，就算你洁身自好，腐败也会找上门来。」对诚实的人来说，中庸之道就是什么也不做，但在萨库尔看来，这也是一种同谋。还有一条路是开口发声，但诚实是有危险的。

在印度，举报人要面临生命危险。就在 18 个月前，印度国家公路管理局一个项目主管揭露了一个公路建设项目中的严重腐败。后来发现他被射死在路边。虽然他的死激起了全国公愤，但这种事一点也不罕见 —— 尤其是因为在印度，举报人是不受法律保护的。说到兰伯西，辛格家族势力强大，是当地有名的一霸。根据公开的新闻报道，家族为解决内部仇恨甚至会花钱雇帮派暴徒。

什么都不做是萨库尔最合理的选择。见义勇为反而可能带来难以预料的恶果，比如他当时在梅劳里 - 古尔冈路上救下那个喝醉的行人，一名警察就想构陷勒索他。那件事的教训是继续向前，管好自己的事，就像司机维贾伊劝他的那样。但是萨库尔决定是否采取正义行动时很少考虑社会规范。他有一套绝对的道德坐标，并以此指导行为。

2005 年 8 月 15 日早晨，也就是提交辞呈的四个月之后，他从睡梦中醒来，决定做点什么。那天是印度独立日，这个全国性假日纪念的是 58 年前印度摆脱英国统治获得自由的日子。萨库尔也想将自己从困扰了他几个月的担忧中解放出来。

他来到地下室的办公室里，打开一个雅虎邮箱账号，那是他之前在权衡各种选择时创建的。他假扮成公司的一名低阶科学家，故意用蹩脚的英语给美国国际开发署和世卫组织的几名官员发了邮件。他写道：「印度的兰伯西实验室在愚弄你们，他们在用虚假的数据将产品推向市场。」他声称兰伯西强迫他伪造数据，「知道这些药物将被用来治疗非洲的患者，我就担心得无法入睡。这些药往好了说是没有功效，往坏了说会引起不良反应，并致人死亡。」他发送邮件时用了假名。他特意挑了一个彰显出权力和名望的名字，希望能引起关注。在创建电子邮件账号时，他使用的是公司法定继承人的名字 —— 马尔文德·辛格。

在那之后，他每晚都要到地下室的电脑上查看电子邮件，期待有人回复。等待是痛苦的。每一天，只要没有看到回复，他就会产生新一轮的痛苦和自我怀疑。他怀疑是自己的邮件不够权威或细节不足，导致无法穿破官僚体制。于是他又写了一封 —— 这一次更有针对性，发给了 6 名美国药监局官员：「我为非洲的那些穷人感到恐惧，他们通过世卫组织和总统防艾计划买下这些假药，原本是希望病情好转，但是不，他们不会好转，只会死去。」对面依然沉默。

他继续发邮件，增添了细节，甚至附上了文档。对面的沉默仍在继续。一周后，他再给美国药监局的几位官员写信，语气仍是一名卑微的实验室科学家，但这一次透露了更多细节：「兰伯西的管理层，包括它的 CEO、业务总监和质检总监，都在系统性地要求实验室及工厂的员工伪造数据以证明药物的稳定性。公司没有数据证明药物的保质期，在南非的气候条件下，贵局批准的配方会在患者拿到之前就降解。这种配方毫无价值，它产生不了任何疗效。」

萨库尔的举报不留情面，但他也感到失望。他原本以为，只要他能克服恐惧发声，外界便会响应，监管者也会找上公司。但现在看来，这件事没人关心。在之后的几天里，他开始零星收到礼貌而含糊的回应。世卫组织的一位秘书来信说，他联系的几位官员都出差去了，不过他的邮件已经收讫，并将得到「适时处理」。

又经过两周的等待，他不再假装用蹩脚的英文，而是直接给美国药监局局长莱斯特·克劳福德（Lester Crawford）写了一封电子邮件。这封电子邮件写得有力而紧迫，他指认兰伯西在出售「未经检验、伪造、无效的药物」。他提到自己给克劳福德的下属写了好几封邮件，也附上了「相关文档和该公司高级管理人员（包括 CEO）之间的往来电子邮件」。最后，他写下几个月前发现公司不法行为时就想到的话：「我请求您终止这种罪行。」

这一次，消息终于有了突破。两天后，萨库尔收到一封详细的电子邮件，发件人是埃德温·里韦拉 - 马丁内斯（Edwin Rivera-Martinez），美国药监局的药物评估和研究中心的调查及预审合规负责人。里韦拉 - 马丁内斯表示，他已收到萨库尔「在 8 月 15 日、17 日、27 日及 31 日发来的电子邮件」，并询问萨库尔愿不愿意开一次电话会议。萨库尔本打算隐藏起来。他最初的计划是将监管者引上正道，自己尽量不被牵扯进去。他没想到自己要做更多。

两人来回交涉了多次。萨库尔婉拒了打电话的要求，说这可能给他的家人带来风险，但他也附上了更多文档。里韦拉 - 马丁内斯回信说肯定不会透露他的姓名和身份：「我们读你的邮件有这样的印象：你认为假药正在危害患者，而你想阻止这种事情发生…… 但如果我们不和你通电话，调查就可能会遇到很大的阻碍。」

萨库尔仍很戒备。他回信反问：「对话会被录音吗？我们交谈时谁会在你边上？如果我和你交谈，会对我个人造成什么不利？我要怎么保护自己不被起诉？毕竟我们讨论的是兰伯西公司犯下的罪行。」埃德温·里韦拉 - 马丁内斯再次回信，说召集相关的官员开电话会议，要比在电子邮件里来回拉锯有效得多。他还向萨库尔保证，会对他的身份严格保密，除非闹上法庭，且法官要求美国药监局透露他的身份信息。

萨库尔犹豫地同意了打电话的要求。但他仍希望将互动的主动权掌握在自己手里。他尝试向里韦拉 - 马丁内斯传授怎么组织电话会议最好、最安全。他在一封电子邮件中问道：「你们能使用公开的网络语音应用吗？我说的是像 GoogleTalk 或 Skype 这样的工具。你只要在电脑上接一支话筒、一个扬声器，就能使用这两种应用了。」接着他还给这位美国药监局官员发送了下载链接。不过美国药监局有他们自己的技术及做事方法。

终于，萨库尔照指示给美国药监局打去了电话。这次电话会议历时约 90 分钟。里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的谈吐正式而有说服力，他温和地提问，美国药监局各部门的员工在一边聆听。现场有一位特派员道格拉斯·洛夫兰（Douglas Loveland）来自美国药监局的刑事调查办公室。迈克·伽维尼也坐在一边，还有一名合规官员凯伦·高桥（KarenTakahashi）。他们想知道萨库尔是从哪里获得情报的，他对这些情报有多大的把握，他披露的一些文档又意味着什么。

在会后写给里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的一封电子邮件中，萨库尔几乎提前就表达了失望：「如果我成功向你们证明了这家公司售往全球的药物并未达到美国药监局规定的品质要求，那我已经相当满意。至于贵局是否会采取进一步的行动，就完全是你们的特权了。我个人希望你们会追究。」

但在之后的几个月里，萨库尔却完全满意不起来。在他看来，这件事是非清楚，黑白分明。他已经提供了证据，只等对方行动了。然而就在这次电话会议的 10 天之后，美国药监局却宣布批准了兰伯西的第一款面向美国市场的小儿抗艾滋病仿制药 —— 齐多夫定的申请。萨库尔又给里韦拉 - 马丁内斯发去了电子邮件：「贵局掌握了这么多数据，已经能证明该公司用虚假数据注册抗逆转录病毒药物，却仍发出这样的批文，这一点实在令我困惑。这是否意味着你们经过调查，已经认定兰伯西是清白的？」

这名官员回复说，由于药物在萨库尔举报之前已经获得批准，只有能证明公司确实欺诈的证据才能推翻这个决定。萨库尔惊呆了：他给美国药监局发送了这么多内部数据和通信记录，清楚地证明了公司的顶层高管串通修改检测结果的行为。如果这还不算欺诈的证据，那什么才是呢？他将会知道，这不是一个容易回答的问题。

在接下来的几周内，萨库尔和里韦拉 - 马丁内斯之间展开了一场友好、缓慢而激烈的决斗，几乎完全是在电子邮件内进行的。里韦拉 - 马丁内斯哄着不情愿的萨库尔，让他交出更多情报，让他再耐心一些。萨库尔则刺激里韦拉 - 马丁内斯，要他催促美国药监局采取更快、更激进的行动。

10 月 6 日，里韦拉 - 马丁内斯要求萨库尔「赶紧来电，事关美国药监局的几场筹备中的新闻发布会」。萨库尔没有及时收到这条消息。美国药监局又宣布批准了兰伯西的两种药物，一种是治疗糖尿病的格列美脲（glimepiride），一种是抗癫痫的加巴喷丁（gabapentin）。沮丧的萨库尔再次致信里韦拉 - 马丁内斯，说自己已经把能给的情报都给他了，而且「将个人和家庭都置于了巨大的危险之中」。他还写道：「贵局的行为真的令我担忧，因为你们似乎无视了我提供的大部分证据…… 如果你们的结论是这家公司没有任何过失，就请让我知道，这样我至少明白自己已经尽力，不会再有遗憾了。」

他想放弃，也好几次对里韦拉 - 马丁内斯声明了这个想法。在 10 月美国药监局批准兰伯西的两种新药之后，他给里韦拉 - 马丁内斯发去了老上司拉金·库马尔的辞呈以及他和公司 CEO 布赖恩·坦皮斯特的最后一次通信。萨库尔说这是他「最后的诚意…… 球发到你的半场了，里韦拉 - 马丁内斯先生，我已经不能再为你或贵局做任何事了。我会等着…… 等看到行动再与你继续对话」。

但对话还是在继续。萨库尔依然不透露真名。美国药监局的人称呼他为「M」或「M 先生」，那是他最初联系他们时使用的名字，马尔文德·辛格的简称。虽然萨库尔分享了许多文件，但最重要的那一份他始终没有披露：库马尔提交给董事会的那份《报告》。这份文件在公司内部的影响力如核辐射一般，将会直接暴露他的身份。11 月 2 日，里韦拉马丁内斯回信了：「上次电话会议…… 你提到有一份风险评估文件，是你在兰伯西期间奉命起草的…… 如果能有这份文件的副本，将使我们的调查更有针对性。」

这个要求激起了另一重担忧。萨库尔虽然没做错事，但他没有律师，也没有豁免权。他致信里韦拉 - 马丁内斯说：「在这两个月的接洽中，你已经能看出我唯一的兴趣就是保护购买这家公司所生产的药物的人民。」他警告说，「我需要得到免于起诉的权利」，不然就不会披露更多文档。

里韦拉 - 马丁内斯努力向他解释，美国药监局并没有赋予豁免权的权力。不过他也安排萨库尔和美国药监局的一位刑事调查员开了一次电话会议，那人可以保证萨库尔不会被公诉。消除这个最后的障碍后，萨库尔立即给里韦拉 - 马丁内斯发送了兰伯西的 CEO 一心想摧毁的那份文件：库马尔向董事会的一个小组委员会展示的演示文稿。这下美国药监局掌握了公司欺诈的完整情况，真是糟糕透了。

萨库尔当时还不知道，其实美国药监局已经认可他的情报是可信的，并且在积极核实了。2005 年 10 月，萨库尔首次联络美国药监局不到两个月后，里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的部门就向美国药监局的现场调查部门发出了申请，委托他们对兰伯西的两家主要工厂 —— 德瓦斯厂和帕奥恩塔萨希布厂发起优先调查。

这份长达五页的任务备忘录罗列了大量可疑的欺诈活动，需要调查员一一查证。里韦拉 - 马丁内斯还要求入选的调查员在出发之前和他一一会面。备忘录还建议调查员，如果需要某份文件，当天就要拿到，因为「据举报人透露，公司有在接受视察期间连夜伪造文件的前科」。

美国药监局需要看到的是兰伯西不加粉饰的形象。但是 2006 年 1 月，萨库尔却突然联系里韦拉 - 马丁内斯，把几名前同事了解的情况紧急传达给了他：公司领导层「在帕奥恩塔萨希布和德瓦斯两家工厂扎了营」，说明「他们正在开展一场大规模掩盖工程，以‘制造'任何贵局调查员可能要求的文件」。鉴于兰伯西似乎知道了即将到来的视察，萨库尔质问里韦拉 - 马丁内斯是否走漏了风声。里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的回答令他震惊：兰伯西在几个月前就收到了监管者即将到来的通知，因为他们对海外公司向来是这么做的。对它们就是这么监管的。

第十二章

制药界的法老

2006 年 1 月 19 日印度古尔冈

就在萨库尔首次和美国药监局联系上的五个月之后，马尔文德·莫汉·辛格接任布赖恩·坦皮斯特，成为兰伯西公司的总经理和 CEO，公司的领导权随之回到了创建它的辛格家族的手中。那年马尔文德才 33 岁，对药物学知之甚少。但是他的个性和教养，加上他的家族背景，都使他显得很适合这个竞争激烈并且以社会使命为核心的行业。

他父亲帕温德是个简朴的人，对一切事物，无论是吃糖果，还是对话，都很节制。在两个儿子很小的时候，他就让他们参加了他们的祖父创建的灵性组织 —— 比亚斯罗陀之主贤聚会（以下简称 RSSB）。帕温德常常带儿子和妻子尼米（Nimmi）去参加组织的活动，一家人在那里做志愿者。虽然帕温德把孩子们送去了精英学校，但他们并没有像同学们那样受到宠爱。读大学时，其他富人家的孩子开着名贵汽车、花着大笔零用钱、到五星级酒店去吃晚餐。和他们不同，马尔文德坐德里交通公司的公交车去大学，每月的零用钱不到 10 美元，吃的也是街边的普通食物。

虽然辛格一家人所重视的清苦生活向来是家族的核心价值，但马尔文德始终是被当作企业大亨来培养的。随着年龄的增长，他逐渐养成了昂贵的品位和掌控者的气质。在他还小的时候，大人就向他介绍了兰伯西的内部机制。父亲会让他浏览公司报告，希望他能从中把握行业潮流。学校放假时，他会跟着兰伯西的药物代表去拜访医生和药剂师，以推销产品，一路就坐在他们的小型摩托车的后座上。

马尔文德轻松地胜任了 CEO 的工作。他的管理雷厉风行，个性争强好胜，充满抱负。他甫一上任就将目光投向全球，寻找机会。谄媚的印度商业媒体把他捧成「制药界的法老」，还称赞他是位「不拘一格的决策者」。在兰伯西内部，有人认为他任性而不成熟。他很在意自己在《福布斯》杂志印度 40 人富豪名单中的位置。他和弟弟施文德的财产总和达到 16 亿美元，2004 年排行第 10 位，到 2005 年却跌到了第 19 位。下一年的情况还会更糟，马尔文德似乎把这归罪于员工不够忠诚。他听说某个部门的产值没有达标时，就会对手下咆哮：「我要看到利润！」他后来对一位记者表示，驱使他如此言行的是他对兰伯西集体使命的激情，也就是让兰伯西成为一家以研究为基础的跨国药企的激情。他还补充说：「与任何商业机构一样，我们也很关注营业收入和净利润。」

马尔文德和施文德兄弟都开价值 10 万美元的香槟色奔驰 S 系轿车，也都收藏艺术品和摄影作品。他们都喜欢漂亮的衣服，都是德里的顶级裁缝店里沃利的瓦伊什的贵客，这家店号称只服务「商界的王公」。每天早晨，马尔文德和弟弟施文德（他在家族企业的另一个部门工作）都会协调一下他们的着装，确保在开同一场会议时不撞衫。电台《发烧 104 FM》的听众将马尔文德选为印度最时髦的人物之一，他甚至还当了一届「印度小姐」比赛的评审。

与员工交流时，马尔文德喜欢引用他最喜欢的一本书 ——2500 年前的中国军事论著《孙子兵法》，他认为这应该成为从商者的必读书。这或许一点也不意外，因为他自己家族内部的房产和企业资产的争执也像战争。

多年来，辛格大家族始终生活在新德里市中心，他们的家位于全世界最高档的地址之一：奥朗则布大道。一道道坚不可摧的围墙背后，一座座豪宅［当地人称之为「独栋」（bungalows）］建在方圆几英亩的花园中。2006 年，马尔文德的母亲尼米和他叔叔阿纳吉特（两人住在同一片几英亩大的家族地产内，但住不同的独栋）向警察投诉对方。尼米宣称她抓到阿纳吉特在非法建墙，为了报复，阿纳吉特雇了几个「高大粗壮」的男人，挥着斧子和锤子来威胁她。「我受到了一众暴徒的攻击、威胁和身体虐待，他们声称帕温德·辛格的家人，包括孙辈在内，一个都别想活命。」她对警察这样说。阿纳吉特也举报了尼米和马尔文德，指控他们犯了恐吓与袭击罪。

「兰伯西家族恩怨」再次成为轰动印度媒体的新闻，自当年巴伊·莫汉·辛格分割其商业帝国和财产之后，辛格家族成员之间的纷纷扰扰就已经成为一段绵延 20 载的传奇。走投无路的尼米去向两个儿子求助。在不到一个月的时间里，马尔文德和他叔叔就宣布家人之间已达成和解。双方都撤回了诉讼，其中有 30 多起可以追溯至 20 世纪 90 年代。这一次马尔文德的身份是家族外交官与斡旋者。

一个熟悉辛格家族的印度记者说，马尔文德看起来是一个「充满灵性的年轻人」。每年，他都会回旁遮普的小镇比阿斯八次，去 RSSB 拜访他的导师，这个组织致力于通过冥想使人的灵魂重新与神结合。他的成长环境注重灵性，家庭也以清苦为核心价值，这些都融入了他的个性。在接受杜克大学商学院校友杂志采访时，他回忆童年，谈论了自己和弟弟：「我们都知道自己出生在一个显赫的家庭，但我们又很幸运，拥有一个简单、虔诚又充满灵性的成长环境…… 我们的家庭注重勤奋、道德、关系的平等和谦卑。」马尔文德执掌兰伯西领导权短短六周之后，便需要借助他想宣扬的那些开明价值观，解决一场日益紧张的冲突了。

2006 年 2 月，美国药监局的两位最有经验的调查员 —— 雷吉娜·布朗（Regina Brown）和罗伯特·霍兰（Robert Horan），来到喜马偕尔邦北部的帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂。他们虽然只有六天时间，却携带了埃德温·里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的部门准备的一份机密任务备忘录：五页文件，上面罗列了迪内希·萨库尔举报的欺诈行为。

虽然兰伯西已提前得到消息并做了准备，但两位调查员还是发现了令人不安的过失：原始数据通常会被丢弃，患者的投诉也未受到调查。但他们最重要的发现仍是迈克·伽维尼博士 14 个月前看到却忽视的东西：那台没有注册、温度设定在 4℃的步入式冰箱，还有后来添置的另一台款式类似的冰箱。两台冰箱里放的东西令人费解：里面放的全是纸箱，纸箱里都是没贴标签的药物样品。「第一台冰箱里存放着 1000 多件物品，第二台存放着 150 多件，上面没有标记数目，没有检测状态，也不知道为什么存放在那里。」两位调查员在报告中写道。

这两台冰箱是做什么用的？里面的一个药瓶上明明标记了 30℃存放。是不小心放进去的吗，就像兰伯西后来声称的那样？还是冰箱里的所有样品都故意放错了地方？两位调查员提出想查看冰箱存放内容的记录，但厂家说没有记录。后来公司又改口说，存放于冰箱中的药物是有清单的，只是没有交给美国药监局，「因为我们不明白美国药监局为什么要看它」。

两台冰箱似乎成为出人意料的造假集中地。在给未经注册的冰箱里的没有标签的样品找各种借口时，公司开始自相矛盾。他们先是宣称这些样品是为「全球监管申请」准备的，说将它们冷冻并不影响稳定性检测。后来公司的高管们又提出一个似乎矛盾的解释，说那些药瓶里装的是「按需检测的对照样品」，只「用作参考，并不产生任何正式数据」。美国药监局表示：「这些‘备用'样品到底有什么用途，我们至今仍不清楚。」两位调查员还取得了 Sotret 的样品。美国药监局发现，这种药物的降解时间远早于保质期限，功效也不如预期。

接下来的一周，布朗和霍兰又出发去德瓦斯视察，那是兰伯西问题最大的生产工厂。2004 年 12 月，迈克·伽维尼去视察过一次，没有发现什么不妥。这一次，布朗和霍兰身后跟了几十名兰伯西的高管，七嘴八舌地回答他们的提问。两位调查员发现，兰伯西之前一直对原始的电子数据弃而不用，只是在他们到达的几周之前，才修改公司的规定保留了这些数据。到后来，两位调查员竟不知不觉向对方讲解起了基本的良好生产规范：原始数据「在生产之后，或实验室外，不能被开展检测以外的人更改」。

霍兰和布朗尽到了职责。他们在工厂发现了重要缺陷，那些缺陷又指向更大的问题。他们发现的问题很严重，而公司的解释又前后矛盾，无法使美国药监局罢休。2006 年 6 月，美国药监局向帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂发出一封警告函，这在全世界看来都像是一次严厉指责。警告函中列举了一系列缺陷：没有保留「分析性的原始数据，对样本的药物稳定性检测的间隔未做记录，对‘备用样品'（冰箱中的药物）的目的也未做明确陈述，稳定性实验室中的人员与资源都准备得不够充分」，另外美国药监局的实验室对抗痤疮药物 Sotret 的检测也显示，它会降解并失去功效。美国药监局表示，在兰伯西证明自己改正了缺陷之前，不会再考虑帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂的任何申请。

这本该将兰伯西一军，因为公司现在正是靠着帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂为美国和总统防艾计划生产其利润最高也最重要的产品。然而美国药监局的行动对那些已经上市的药物根本起不了什么作用，它们要么是从已经获得批准的工厂里生产出来的，要么是由其他工厂提交申请获批的。就在美国药监局发出那封警告函的几周前，里韦拉 - 马丁内斯给萨库尔写了一封堪称悲哀的电子邮件：「我们现在受到很大的压力，不得不批准兰伯西仿制普伐他汀（一种降低胆固醇的药物）的申请，本周四这种药物的专利就要过期了。」简言之，这位官员也受制于美国药监局的强大惯性，那就是继续批准新药申请，几乎是不管发生什么都不会停止。

萨库尔已经竭尽所能。由于对美国药监局仍给兰伯西的药物开绿灯感到沮丧，他努力把注意力集中到家人身上。这时苏娜尔刚刚生下他们的第二个孩子，是个女孩，他们给她取名莫哈薇（Mohavi）。这个孩子会给他们带来好运的，萨库尔对妻子说。然而，即使当苏娜尔躺在古尔冈的一家私立医院，怀里搂着女儿，并且受到精心看护，她仍感到担忧：在这家医院住四天要花一大笔钱，而夫妇俩已经没有医疗保险了，正靠着积蓄度日。他们原本在职场有着良好的地位，现在的生活却脆弱而不确定。

萨库尔没能在印度找到满意的职位。他的咨询活计有一搭没一搭，收入也零零碎碎。莫哈薇出生后没过几个月，他终于收到了印孚瑟斯技术有限公司的聘书，对方要求他大量出差，还要搬到美国，几乎要全职常驻。他认为自己别无选择，只能接下聘书，他还想说服苏娜尔与他同去，甚至向她母亲求情，但苏娜尔已经下定决心要和孩子们一起留在印度。

苏娜尔向来为自己的独立而自豪。她不是个孤立无助的人，也不是没有门路。没错，她是接受了包办婚姻，有两个孩子，并且不再工作。但养育她长大的母亲拥有梵文的硕士学位，母亲坚持让她接受最好的教育，并能在社会上自立。这些苏娜尔都做到了。当年她取得计算机工程硕士学位并在开利公司做软件工程师，那也是她婚姻生活中最和睦的一段时光。她和萨库尔并肩工作，一起养育伊斯汗。

然而，得知丈夫准备离开印度前往美国的那天，是她人生中最黑暗的日子。虽然她自己选择留在印度，不过仍会感觉孤独。她的父母住得很远，在南边 800 多英里之外的赖布尔。那天早晨她找不到伊斯汗，于是沿着楼梯来到萨库尔的地下办公室。她看见丈夫双手抱着伊斯汗在哭，他不想让妻子知道自己的伤心事。苏娜尔从没见过萨库尔哭。伊斯汗也没见过，他困惑地问道：「爸爸，你为什么哭呀？」

等苏娜尔明白过来之后，她喊道：「别这样，迪内希！别在伊斯汗面前这样。」她的内心萌生出各种恐惧，但她最在意的是儿子或许会因为丈夫的悲伤而受到创伤。苏娜尔还不知道她丈夫已经在和美国药监局接洽了，但这件事带来的紧张感却像一阵雾气似的笼罩着他们的婚姻。

他们夫妇之间向来有一道隔阂。即使在两人最亲密的时候，萨库尔也在自己周围竖着一道道墙壁。他不习惯向别人吐露心声，匿名联络美国药监局的事也只对一个人说过 —— 他的朋友和前下属迪内希·卡斯胡里尔。卡斯胡里尔以为萨库尔才向美国药监局举报，并认为他「做了一件正确的事」。他不知道自己的这位朋友一直在与美国药监局对话。他要是知道，或许就会表现出怀疑了：在印度，个人真的能挑战公司并获胜吗？

此时萨库尔也在怀疑自己的行动是否明智。他已经将家人置于危险之中，他为他们的安全担忧。辛格家族以威胁他人闻名，而萨库尔又知道了他们公司太多的秘密。萨库尔将家门外保安的值班时间延长到了每天 24 小时。他对苏娜尔说，这么做是因为他要出远门。同时，他等待着美国药监局的明确行动，他的失望情绪也越来越重，因为对方似乎没有能力或者没有兴趣采取行动。

重压之下，有一个人似乎理解萨库尔的处境，也认同他的目标，并相信他的行动是正义的。她的名字叫黛比·罗伯逊（Debbie Robertson），是美国药监局刑事调查办公室的一名调查员。2006 年 1 月，她写信给萨库尔，说自己将担任他在美国药监局的新联络人。

虽然埃德温·里韦拉 - 马丁内斯所在的部门将继续调查兰伯西是否合规，但罗伯逊的加入却表明这个案件进入了一个新的层面。她的工作是调查兰伯西是否违反了任何法律，或是否应该承担任何刑事责任。

罗伯逊是美国药监局的一名新人，2005 年 10 月才加入。但她又是一位经验老到的执法专家，之前在国税局做了 10 年的刑事调查员。因为刚刚加入美国药监局，上司只给她派了复核兰伯西案的任务，意思就是这个案子已经没什么好查的了。但罗伯逊仍有怀疑。在加入和「M」（萨库尔在美国药监局的代号）的对话之后，她立刻发现此人态度严肃、头脑十分聪明，而且是冒着相当大的风险与美国药监局联络的。于是她给萨库尔回了几封充满善意和安慰的电子邮件，这使萨库尔感受到了他在其他美国药监局成员那里都没感受到的东西：希望。

尽管如此，萨库尔在回到美国时仍带着一腔沮丧。他从前同事那里听说：美国药监局在印度的视察毫无波澜，他担心调查也就到此为止了。但关于这件事，罗伯逊也安慰了他：「兰伯西认为这次视察平安无事，这其实倒是一件好事。」她在给萨库尔的邮件中写道：「这说明他们没起一点疑心。」

自萨库尔开始向美国药监局举报，时间已经过去几个月了。他眼看着美国药监局一样接一样地批准兰伯西的新药。黛比·罗伯逊试着让他振作起来：「我请你想象一下：你告诉我们的情报，即使只有一半得到证实，也足以让整个公司倒闭。这可是全世界最大的仿制药公司之一。」她接着写道：「如果因为程序失误而输掉官司，本身就是一桩罪行。」她还建议萨库尔「想想美国公司安然吧，把它扳倒费了多少时间」。

萨库尔回复道：「你相信美国药监局还会对兰伯西采取任何实际的行动吗？…… 我怀疑自己所有的努力和折腾都没有丝毫作用。」

罗伯逊鼓励他不要放弃希望。「正义之轮转得很慢，」她写道，「但它从不停止。」
