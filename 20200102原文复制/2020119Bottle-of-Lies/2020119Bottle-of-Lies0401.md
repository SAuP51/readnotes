# Part IV Making a Case

## 0401. Out of the Shadows

OCTOBER 11, 2006

Princeton, New Jersey

On a bright, crisp morning, Debbie Robertson brought two of her colleagues to the AmeriSuites Hotel off U.S. Highway 1 to meet the man who was referred to in the agency only as「M,」short for Malvinder Singh.

It had been fourteen months since Thakur first reached out to the FDA. He’d been reliable and accurate. He did not appear to have shaded the truth or overblown his information. Nor did he seem to have any discernible ulterior motive, other than to stop his former employer from making dangerously inferior drugs. But the investigators were preparing to take a fateful step, and it was Robertson’s responsibility to confirm that her agency and U.S. prosecutors were not being led into some sort of internecine feud or ambush, and that「M」was as credible as he seemed.

As FDA agents and prosecutors prepared to serve a search warrant at Ranbaxy’s New Jersey headquarters, Thakur had become the agency’s eyes and ears. Robertson had turned to him for answers to question after question: Who sat where? How many entrances and exits? Where was the WAN access? Where were the domain controllers? Did the MS exchange email server use encryption? Could the Princeton servers be shut down remotely from India? Was there a way to prevent this once the India office got wind of the intrusion?

In his deliberate and detailed manner, Thakur helped Robertson navigate a virtual maze. He created a digital schematic of the New Jersey offices, down to the location of the bathrooms. His emails were full of minute details.

But in September 2006, after nine months of intense email contact, Robertson wrote to him with a different question: Could they meet? As she explained:

I am not trying to deceive you in any way, I just think it would be the most judicious use of time and would help clarify some issues. To be completely honest with you, the U.S. Attorney’s Office is totally supportive of this case, but because of the complexity and political ramifications, the Assistant U.S. Attorney that is prosecuting this case is being very conservative and wants to ensure we understand exactly what all the information means.

This wasn’t exactly true. So far, federal prosecutors at the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office barely seemed to know the case existed and certainly didn’t understand it. There was only one prosecutor assigned to it, the supervisor of the Greenbelt office, who had a full caseload and limited attention. Nonetheless, it was incumbent on Robertson to know her source and to make sure she understood his motives.

Thakur, who was now working in New Jersey, was willing to meet and said so immediately. Still, the idea concerned him. He had no legal representation and had been working with her as an「honest individual,」he wrote back.「Since this is a more formal meeting, do I need a lawyer representing me? I have to tell you that I am not all that wealthy and getting U.S. legal representation would be very prohibitively expensive and unaffordable for me.」But Robertson was reassuring on this point too. The meeting would simply be a face-to-face version of all their email contact to date.

Thakur was in the lobby of the AmeriSuites Hotel at 9:30 a.m., impeccably dressed in a blazer and slacks. There was Robertson, with dark wavy hair down to her shoulders, warm brown eyes, and a kind and practical demeanor. Her Sig Sauer .357 was holstered under a flowy blouse. With her were two other women: another agent from the Office of Criminal Investigations and the compliance officer, Karen Takahashi, who had been on the original conference call. They sat in the lobby, the fall sunshine spilling through the windows.

The group remained there for two hours as Thakur retraced the history of events inside the company, how he’d gotten the information, which U.S. products he believed were compromised, and how Ranbaxy had gamed the FDA’s previous inspections. Robertson asked most of the questions. When she asked what risks he foresaw for his family, Thakur relayed how the Singh family had hired thugs in previous disputes and how whistleblowers were typically dealt with in India.

A hush settled over the group. Though Thakur was doing everything possible to control his nerves, Robertson could see he was shaking.

By the time the trio of FDA agents left, the man they’d referred to only as「M」had come fully to life as Dinesh Thakur. But his choice of aliases had been apt. He had intuited that, in bringing Ranbaxy to justice, Malvinder Singh would become one of the biggest obstacles.

On November 29, 2006, Singh led a delegation of five top company executives, Abha Pant among them, as well as the company’s intellectual property attorney, Jay Deshmukh, Ranbaxy’s longtime outside lawyer, Kate Beardsley, and a representative from the consulting company Parexel, to FDA headquarters. They had come on a mission vital to Ranbaxy’s survival: to convince agency officials to lift their freeze on the review of drug applications from Paonta Sahib. Across a conference table, they faced ten skeptical FDA regulators, including Edwin Rivera-Martinez, who had agreed to hear out the company. Ranbaxy had asked for the meeting, and the executives had prepared for it.

Abha Pant, then Ranbaxy’s associate vice president of regulatory affairs, wearing a serious expression, began:「Thank you for the opportunity to meet.」

Malvinder Singh, gazing calmly at the regulators, explained that Ranbaxy was committed to quality manufacturing.「We take the FDA’s observations very seriously, and have taken immediate action to resolve them,」he explained.「I’ve authorized all resources to ensure that we are fully compliant.」No one spoke. He added,「Compliance is important to me personally. I am the third generation of the family to manage Ranbaxy.」He then offered,「If for any reason you feel that you’re not getting full cooperation, I would invite you to contact me personally.」

The regulators seemed skeptical as the executives took turns describing the company’s new quality improvement plans. This included hiring an outside auditing firm, Parexel, which was staffed by former FDA veterans, and a new management review committee.

The executives explained that they had added eighteen new analysts in the stability laboratory and eliminated its backlog of samples. The company had also stopped refrigerating its pending stability samples, they claimed. The consultant, Dr. Ron Tetzlaff, chimed in, explaining that his company, Parexel, had made extensive recommendations and Ranbaxy had addressed each one.

But the conversation circled back to the mysterious samples in the refrigerators. The regulators wanted to know whether any had been used to generate stability data for the U.S. market. A Ranbaxy executive denied that. The executives also pushed back against the FDA’s findings that the Sotret had lower-than-expected potency. The company had pulled samples from the market, tested them, and was unable to replicate the FDA’s findings, they claimed. This was, the Ranbaxy executives suggested, because the FDA’s testing method was less precise than their own.

The regulators looked displeased. They dug deeper. One of the more senior bureaucrats there said that the FDA wanted to see the audits done by Ranbaxy’s consultant, Parexel. The company argued that those were confidential. The two sides volleyed back and forth on the audits.

Ranbaxy’s outside lawyer, Kate Beardsley, piped up. Given the company’s concerted effort to address the FDA’s concerns and the devastating impact of the agency’s finding of Official Action Indicated, would the agency be willing to lift its hold on Ranbaxy’s applications from Paonta Sahib? The regulators’ answer was no.

Though Malvinder, at thirty-four, knew how to resolve problems in India, solving them in the United States was another matter entirely. By meeting’s end, the standoff had only intensified. Regulators would not lift the stay on applications from Paonta Sahib until the plant cleared another inspection. And they wanted to see the Parexel audits.

That was bad enough. But there was something potentially even worse that Ranbaxy executives took away from the meeting. One of them thought he’d spied Raj Kumar’s PowerPoint — the infamous Self-Assessment Report (SAR) — among a stack of documents in front of one of the regulators.

Three months earlier, Abha Pant had shared important intelligence with Jay Deshmukh and Ranbaxy’s U.S. chairman during the men’s cigarette break outside the company’s Princeton headquarters. An FDA investigator, who was Indian, had warned her confidentially that regulators had a「bombshell document」that could potentially destroy the company. At the time, Pant had no idea what document the investigator meant, but apparently it had slowed the agency’s approval of Ranbaxy’s drug applications. Deshmukh, following clues inside the company, was able to unearth the calamitous document, only to have it surface again on an FDA conference table.

Two months after the tense meeting at FDA headquarters, the agency returned to Paonta Sahib. As was customary, the inspection was announced in advance. The FDA’s ostensible purpose was to monitor the manufacture of the active ingredient pravastatin sodium, used in the generic version of Pravachol, to lower cholesterol. But inside the agency, the assignment sheet for the inspection left little doubt as to what regulators were looking for:「We continue to have concerns about the integrity of the data in the laboratory. . . . We are concerned about the deletion of records and contradictions in the account of statements between the inspection team and the firm.」The assignment also noted,「Be mindful that there may be two sets of books for [active pharmaceutical ingredients] not manufactured at Paonta Sahib.」

More telling than what the agency was looking for was the investigator they sent to look for it: Jose Hernandez, now the top compliance officer for the Baltimore District Office, and one of the investigators most likely to detect a fraud. Hernandez was the investigator who had smelled dog meat in the crab-processing plant and found the smoking pile of drug bottles in the woods behind the pharmaceutical plant in Louisiana. What would he be able to find at a plant that was on notice that the FDA was coming and whose survival depended on impressing the agency?

Hernandez arrived on January 26, 2007. A group of officials trailed him as he surveyed the plant carefully. The facilities were immaculate. The units seemed well staffed. Officials retrieved records promptly while he watched. On full alert, he studied the raw data from the pravastatin sodium batch records. Something wasn’t right, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.

He turned up an unauthorized notebook in the desk drawer of a warehouse supervisor, with notations about possible use of an active ingredient, made by a company that Ranbaxy had not registered with the FDA. It was a tantalizing clue. But company executives explained that Ranbaxy had never used that material, which was why they hadn’t reported its use to the FDA. Hernandez asked an employee to run the name of the unapproved company through the computer system, as he watched, but he could see no trace of it.

Hernandez stayed for just three and a half days, all the time the FDA gave him. Although his inspection was tough and yielded some findings, he hadn’t nailed it, despite his legendary nose for malfeasance. But he knew that something was wrong, and he vowed to find it on his next visit.

## 0402. Do Not Give to FDA

FEBRUARY 14, 2007

Princeton, New Jersey

As a hail-and-snow storm pelted the Princeton area, elaborate Valentine’s Day floral bouquets arrived for employees that morning at Ranbaxy’s U.S. corporate headquarters. Then, around 9:30 a.m., chaos erupted as federal agents, led by Debbie Robertson, swarmed the reception area. Vincent Fabiano, the vice president of global licensing, was in his office when a man he had never seen before walked in and told him,「Step away from your desk.」

「Who the hell are you?」Fabiano asked.

「I’m an FDA criminal investigator,」the man responded. Fabiano noticed the gun on the man’s hip and stepped away from his desk as directed.

On the second floor, an employee heard a voice boom behind her:「Don’t touch your computer. Don’t touch your phone. Step away from your desk.」Her first thought was that there was a bomb threat. She turned around to see FDA criminal investigators in bulletproof vests, guns strapped to their waists, surging across the floor, along with local New Jersey police.

Panic spread as the building was surrounded by police cars.「People were freaking out, crying,」a former employee recalled.「They took every computer. There were people with guns.」Employees dove under desks, not sure whether the action was an immigration raid or something else. The agents were carrying out boxes of documents and herded employees to a conference room, where they began interviewing each one: they asked about their citizenship, how long they’d worked for the company, even their height and weight. No one could use the bathroom without being escorted by a federal agent.

Jay Deshmukh, the company attorney, who was out of the office that morning, got a panicked call from his assistant, begging him to come. Deshmukh arrived to a scene of bedlam, with federal agents lugging out computers and interrogating staff. He dove in, trying to get the agents to stop interviewing employees.

Even as Deshmukh tried to restore calm, he didn’t feel at all composed, especially after he studied the search warrant. Federal prosecutors seemed to be looking for a world of incriminating material. As the news ricocheted from New Jersey to New Delhi, Ranbaxy issued a statement:「This action has come as a surprise. The company is not aware of any wrongdoing. It is cooperating fully with the officials.」

By late afternoon, traumatized employees were finally escorted from the building, past piles of drooping flowers in the reception area, which smelled like a funeral parlor. They would later call it the「Great Valentine’s Day Raid.」It lasted so long that the FDA agents who participated called it the「Valentine’s Day Massacre.」It killed their evening plans.

Federal agents emerged from the raid with around five terabytes of data — about half the contents of the print collection of the Library of Congress, they estimated. But even amid this avalanche of records, one document in particular stood out. It was the company’s own secret report on its Sotret formulation problems that Abha Pant had filed away. Investigators found it in her office with the cover page that read in bold letters,「Do Not Give to FDA.」The document made clear that the company’s defense of its Sotret drug at the FDA meeting two and a half months earlier — and its claim that regulators had tested it improperly, thus getting a bad result — had been a bald-faced lie. The company knew its drug was failing. It had known for years.

Thakur was in India during the raid, celebrating Mohavi’s first birthday. It should have been a peaceful family time, but the raid devoured his attention. Former colleagues were contacting him to explain what was happening inside the company. He’d told no one about his role in the search warrant. Ten days later, in late February, he learned what he feared most: Malvinder Singh and board chairman Tejendra Khanna had apparently held a meeting with top company executives in which they reviewed a list of people who might have given the FDA the information that had led to the raid. Thakur’s name was on it. So was that of his former boss, Raj Kumar.

What if the company tried to harm him or his family? What if something happened when he was away in the United States? He shared his fears with Robertson, who got him the name and direct contact information for the regional security officer stationed at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi. He mentioned to Sonal, as though in passing, that the FDA was reaching out to former employees and had also reached out to him. If she encountered any trouble, there was someone at the embassy who could help.

Sonal felt increasingly ill at ease. A pall hung over the family: their money worries, her husband’s preoccupation, his long absences in the United States, living in a freestanding home with a solitary guard post outside, alone with an infant and a toddler. The thought never occurred to her that her husband had played some pivotal role in the investigation of his former company. Nonetheless, she was concerned enough about the family’s safety to paste the information he’d given her on the inside of her closet door.

In the weeks after the search warrant, as the FDA’s investigators fanned out, soliciting both those who might help them and those who might implicate themselves, employees began choosing sides. Some remained loyal and hired company-paid lawyers. Ranbaxy promoted, and even relocated to India, several senior executives — including Abha Pant — thereby moving them out of easy reach of the FDA and American prosecutors. Others broke off contact with the company and cooperated with investigators. Dr. Raj Kumar received two messages at home from the company lawyer, Jay Deshmukh, urging him to call.

To Deshmukh, Kumar was a bomb that could detonate at any moment. He’d left on principle and had never agreed to remain silent. He might still have the devastating SAR that the company had worked so hard to destroy. The company’s top leadership had been shown the document, and it implicated them directly.

Kumar was「basically in hiding,」Deshmukh recalled.「We were trying to get him out of hiding. If he had good facts, we wanted to know. If he had bad facts, I wanted to know.」He added,「They were mostly bad facts.」

Kumar, who had returned to London, didn’t call Deshmukh back. He hired his own lawyer. Deshmukh, increasingly desperate to keep Kumar under wraps, called Kumar’s lawyer to offer legal assistance. He also left a chilling message:「Make sure that Raj is careful in what he tells the FDA, because he also has exposure in this case.」

Kumar read it as a clear threat.

On the morning of March 16, about one month after the search at Ranbaxy’s New Jersey headquarters, Dinesh Thakur arrived at the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and was led to a conference room, where numerous investigators and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Maryland, whom he’d never met, were seated around the table. Robertson was there and explained that they now had enough evidence to proceed against the company.

One of the prosecutors told Thakur bluntly,「You need to get a lawyer.」

He was flabbergasted.「Why? I told you everything I know. You’re a lawyer. Isn’t it your job to protect people like me?」

「No, no, no . . . ,」the prosecutor began.

「You are telling me you verified all my allegations? I have barely worked for two years. How am I going to be able to afford a lawyer?」Thakur shot back.

「That’s not my problem,」said the prosecutor.「Now this is a formal investigation. None of the government attorneys can actually represent you.」

Robertson, noting Thakur’s distress, asked if he needed to use a restroom — which gave her the opportunity to speak with him privately in the hall. Robertson gave him contact information for an organization called the Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund (TAFEF), an organization that helped potential whistleblowers, and urged him to contact the group. They could help him find an attorney, she explained.

Thakur felt at his lowest ebb on the drive back to his temporary apartment in Belle Mead, New Jersey. He was seven thousand miles from his children, living on cereal and salad in a cheerless rental, while barely staying afloat financially. Now he had to find an attorney to protect him from the process he himself had set in motion. All evening he thought about the piece of paper Robertson had given him. He felt that calling the number would lead him even further away from the life he knew and expected. Yet he was already in a place he couldn’t recognize and getting in deeper by the day.

Thakur went to sleep thinking about the phone number Robertson gave him, and it was his first thought when he woke. That morning he called and left a message. By the afternoon, he had received a call back from TAFEF, which supplied him with a lawyer’s name and phone number.

At age thirty-seven, Andrew Beato was finding his way at the prominent firm of Stein, Mitchell, Muse & Cipollone LLP in Washington, D.C. The young lawyer had thinning brown hair, wore steel-rimmed glasses, and spoke in hushed tones so low that visitors had to lean forward to hear him. He typically wore a neutral expression, which did little to mask his air of intensity. When he smiled, which was infrequent, slight dimples emerged. He had been representing whistleblowers for about five years and was told by TAFEF to expect a call from a potential client.

His firm had a history of representing whistleblowers. In 2002, it had represented Cynthia Cooper, the internal auditor at WorldCom who’d uncovered an almost `$4` billion accounting fraud. One of the firm’s founding partners, Jacob Stein, had represented Monica Lewinsky during the Clinton impeachment hearings. But Beato was still proving himself, and his judgments were subject to review.

It was late in the day on a Friday, and Beato was packing up to leave the office, running late (as usual) to meet his wife, who had also worked as an attorney and was now a stay-at-home mom. He had just gotten his coat on and was almost out the door when the phone rang. He was certain it was his wife, calling to ask where he was. The voicemail picked up. Instead, he heard the soft polite voice of a man with an Indian accent and a formal manner: the whistleblower.

Beato called him back and explained that he was just running out and asked for a「very short」overview. Thakur did not know where to begin, so he just started talking. As Beato listened, trying to hold on to the fragmentary pieces, he became certain that the man was crazy.

Thakur’s story sounded so implausible as to be impossible. The top executives at India’s biggest pharmaceutical company had committed intentional global fraud. The company’s drugs were being taken by U.S. consumers. And to hear the man tell it, the scope was not just limited to one manufacturing plant, or one drug. It was numerous plants and dozens of drugs being distributed around the world. The scope of the fraud the man was alleging made him sound deranged. He must not know much about how businesses operated, or even about how to make a drug, Beato figured. Fraud was typically limited and select — a rogue employee, a single incident, or a poorly managed plant. How could everything at a company be fraudulent?

It made no sense that hundreds of employees were allegedly participating in this fraud, as though it were just business as usual. That couldn’t happen. If it had, how could it have gone undetected for so long? As Thakur talked and talked, Beato grew more concerned about being late for his wife and increasingly dubious about the whistleblower.

「I have to go now,」Beato told him. He did not want to be unkind.「Why don’t you send me an email instead, with details about what happened?」

Less than twenty-four hours later, after exchanging about half a dozen emails with Dinesh Thakur, Beato had reversed his earlier view. Though he was far from clear on what had happened at Ranbaxy, he was beginning to think that some version of Thakur’s insane story just might be true.

In many ways, Beato was the perfect lawyer to make sense of the Ranbaxy case. Health care had long been his family’s business, and illness its fate. Beato had grown up in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of seven children. His mother died of breast cancer when he was two. His father, a dedicated internist, was the rare physician who would make house calls late into the night. Unflaggingly committed to his patients’ welfare, he was a poor businessman and refused to limit time with his patients in an era of managed care.

As some of his siblings entered health care, Beato turned to the law; he had arrived at Stein Mitchell right out of law school. At first, he represented companies in their dealings with the Federal Trade Commission. But the work left him cold. He didn’t want to get up every morning figuring out a way to get a company off the hook. How could he help people, not just corporations, from inside a corporate law firm, where he had to remain to pay off student loans? While Beato was still struggling to answer this question, his father died from a rare brain tumor. Though his father left the family with no savings, he had「wealth of character,」Beato recalled. Hundreds of his grateful patients turned out for the wake, proof that his father had lived a meaningful life dedicated to helping others.

Beato’s desire to do the same led him to a fledgling area of the law: representing whistleblowers. The practice dated back to the Civil War and fell under a part of the federal False Claims Act known as qui tam, an abbreviated Latin version of the phrase translated as「he who brings this action for the king as well as for himself.」It allowed whistleblowers to sue those defrauding the government and collect a portion of any recovered funds. The law had initially been intended to stop profiteers from selling defective supplies to the Union army. In the 1940s, after an amendment to the False Claims Act reduced the amount that a whistleblower could recoup, the law fell into disuse. In 1987, however, after reporting of widespread fraud by defense contractors (like the infamous `$640` toilet seat sold to the Pentagon), the law was again amended to increase a whistleblower’s reward, creating a new incentive to report fraud, and for lawyers to take such cases.

Though Beato lost his first whistleblowing case, which involved a cardiologist doing unnecessary procedures, he saw the righting of wrongs against the people and their government as an essentially moral pursuit.

Weeks after their first conversation, Thakur sat across from Beato and several of his colleagues, including a senior partner, at the law firm’s conference table. Though smartly dressed and articulate, Thakur seemed exhausted and anxious, with dark circles beneath his eyes and sagging shoulders. Painstakingly, in a quiet voice, he began to describe the complex web of deceit that Ranbaxy had engaged in and his role in penetrating it.

Barely ten minutes into the meeting, Thakur broke down and began to sob.「What did I do?」he asked repeatedly.「What did I do? I just wanted to do the right thing.」He’d stupidly put his family in jeopardy, and now there was no going back. The FDA had started issuing subpoenas to Ranbaxy officials, and Thakur was fearful about how the company would respond. These problems were sorted out in India very differently, he explained. In considering the physical risks to Thakur and his family, the lawyers realized that they were dealing with something they had never confronted in the United States.

Thakur’s case was also inordinately complex. The lawyers had to consider the scope of the fraud. Was it even a false claims case? What violations had Ranbaxy committed, and had those materially altered the drugs? How could they prove that? And how could they best protect the man sobbing in their conference room? The case also posed a major financial risk for the firm: they could incur huge expenses, lose, and wind up with nothing. But after meeting with Thakur over the course of two days, the lawyers were almost certain, despite the daunting complications, that the firm would represent him.「This was a public health issue,」Beato recalled.「You were not going to find anyone at this firm backing down.」

In a quiet moment, Thakur asked Beato,「How do I pay you and what do I pay you? Obviously, you are not doing this for free.」

Beato’s answer came as a revelation. Thakur would pay them nothing. Instead, the firm would roll the dice on representing Thakur for free and work to help build the government’s case against Ranbaxy, with Thakur’s evidence as its primary guide. The firm would then file its findings in a confidential lawsuit against the company, which would remain under seal. While the government investigated, Thakur’s identity would remain secret. If there was a settlement, Thakur could net up to a third of the government’s recovery and Beato’s firm would get a portion of that. Under the arrangement, Thakur would become a legally protected whistleblower. Until that moment, he had not even known such a protection existed.

## 0403. How Big Is the Problem?

2007

Rockville, Maryland

As the regulatory case against Ranbaxy moved slowly through different FDA divisions, it landed on the desk of Douglas A. Campbell, a thirty-seven-year-old officer with the agency’s international compliance team. Some of his superiors found little of interest.「We don’t really think there is anything there,」one of them advised. The case looked like a protracted fight over a single manufacturing plant. Ranbaxy’s lawyers were insisting that the FDA lift its temporary ban on new applications from the Paonta Sahib plant, claiming that the company had made all needed corrections. Regulators were demanding that Ranbaxy hand over full copies of the audits done by its consultant, Parexel. Stalemates like these littered the FDA’s offices.

But as Campbell read the paperwork for the case, he became intrigued. In its responses to the FDA’s inspection findings, the company blamed most of the problems on transcription errors, lost data, or mismatched internal systems. But in excerpts from the audits conducted by Parexel, which Ranbaxy’s lawyers had refused to release in full, the consultants had noted「inconsistent entries」in some of the data from stability tests. The company was now sending corrected data. But some of the discrepancies seemed awfully big to be mere mistakes, such as a forty-five-day discrepancy as to when a test was conducted. How could the company have been so confused? Or sloppy?

Companies had to continue testing their drugs at predetermined intervals long after they launched them on the market. Every year a company had to file the test results in annual reports to the FDA. Few at the agency actually read these reports, and they piled up in back offices. But the information in the reports still needed to be true.

On July 3, 2007, Campbell drove over to the Office of Generic Drugs, which was headquartered at the Metro Park North campus, and dug out the annual reports that Ranbaxy had filed for three anti-infective drugs: fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, and efavirenz. From the reports, the company appeared to be testing the drugs at appropriate intervals. But as Campbell compared that data to the corrected data on his desk, he was startled by the differences. The annual report for fluconazole stated that Ranbaxy had conducted the three-month stability test on September 26, 2004. But in its response to the warning letter, the company stated that it had performed that same test on August 17, 2005. There was almost a year’s difference between the two dates.

To Campbell, it looked like Ranbaxy had either lost control of its manufacturing process or lost track of its lies.「Once you matched up [the dates], it was blatant,」he recalled.

His discovery mattered — at least to him. The whole reason to test drugs so frequently was to ensure that unsafe products were detected quickly and didn’t stay on the market any longer than necessary. But Campbell’s superiors didn’t seem particularly excited by the mismatch of dates. Some seemed satisfied by the company’s claims that its problems stemmed largely from「transcription errors」or simple failures to update data. Campbell didn’t buy it. This was not just「.54 vs .45 type of stuff,」as he recalled. Ranbaxy’s data was so inaccurate that he couldn’t even「find a place where the data actually meant anything.」And if the data was meaningless, then there was no proof that Ranbaxy’s drugs were safe and effective.

Doug Campbell’s boss, Edwin Rivera-Martinez, the first FDA bureaucrat to have corresponded with Thakur, sided with Campbell. He was not mollified by Ranbaxy’s claims of correction. As he wrote to a colleague in March 2007, he was convinced that the agency should continue to withhold approval of new applications from Paonta Sahib until Ranbaxy had「completely addressed all issues」from the FDA’s warning letter. As Campbell and his colleagues continued to review the documentation from Ranbaxy, each thread they pulled, each strand of testing data they followed, seemed to lead to something bigger — some new revelation that the regulators had not anticipated.

By October 2007, the company reported that its gabapentin, a sensitive drug used to treat epileptic seizures, had shown a spike in an impurity called compound A. Under good manufacturing practices, abnormal spikes or troughs in data were known as out-of-specification (OOS). The company had been required to report the gabapentin finding to the FDA within three days of discovering it, but instead it had waited four months. The regulators soon discovered that the company had not just failed to report the gabapentin impurity spike. It had failed to report irregular test results to the FDA’s New Jersey district office for six years. For any vigilant drug company with a large volume of products, such reports should have been a regular occurrence.

The company blamed the troubling lapse on a cascade of small internal problems. But when the FDA investigators went to Ranbaxy’s New Jersey headquarters, which should have been issuing the reports, they stumbled on an even bigger finding: for the 600-milligram gabapentin tablets, the company had conducted its three-, six-, and nine-month stability tests in a span of four days, and all on the same day for the 800-milligram tablets. But the test dates had been falsified and documented as if they were performed at the proper intervals.

Inside the FDA, this news was regarded as slam-dunk proof of fraud. Campbell emailed Rivera-Martinez,「Bullseye!!!」Rivera-Martinez reported the finding up the chain of command:「We hit a goldmine!」He laid out the details of the phony testing. Deb Autor, director of CDER’s Office of Compliance, responded with one word:「Wow.」

Suddenly, the lapses, irregularities, and omissions looked like something very different. Campbell scrawled in his government-issued notebook,「How Big Is the Problem?」And then,「What do they do to come into compliance?」Below this he wrote,「Present the chance to come clean or lie again. Will they continue to jerk us around?」

And below that:「Can we trust them?」

Campbell, a brawny former football player, spent eight years in the army, three on active duty. He had started his FDA career in 1998 at the Roanoke, Virginia, resident post, inspecting everything from infant formula to a tilapia aquaculture farm. By 2006, Campbell had moved to the Division of Manufacturing and Product Quality’s international compliance team, nested deep within CDER. His group performed about one hundred overseas inspections a year. Campbell himself had inspected cheese in Nicaragua and stuffed grape leaves in Greece.

Almost overnight, it seemed, the agency was hit by a wave of globalization. The number of pending inspections for Campbell’s division spiked. The foreign applications were「all stacked up in our offices,」Campbell recalled. From 2002 to 2009, the number of facilities overseas that required inspection by the FDA skyrocketed from around five hundred to over three thousand. As Campbell noted in a review,「The responsibilities related to our mission have exploded. The burden is immense, and the resources have not been readily allocated.」

As the need for inspections grew, FDA policy became an all-out scramble to keep up. At one point, Campbell wrote to a colleague to ask about the agency’s travel policy:「Do we send teams to India during Monsoon season? Do we send teams to India when it’s going to be 110+ degrees in the shade?」The answer came back:「In the past we would routinely defer travel to India during the monsoon, however, due to increase workload we no longer adhere to this.」

Before a company was cleared to manufacture a drug at a plant overseas, Campbell’s division was supposed to conduct a preapproval inspection to determine if the facility could safely and competently make the drug. But just keeping track of the facilities, and the respective codes that identified them, was a fearsome task. Were the manufacturing plants in the system those really making the drugs? Were the plants that were actually making the drugs the ones being inspected? Campbell understood that he and his colleagues held an enormous responsibility, which weighed on him as he sifted through the Ranbaxy paperwork:「[Should] we let these drugs come into the U.S. or not?」

In October, nine months after Jose Hernandez had inspected Paonta Sahib and come away with suspicions but little else, he received a remarkable email. It was from an employee, writing under the pseudonym「Sunny,」who said that he’d seen Hernandez at the plant in January and had finally summoned the courage to write. Sunny explained that Hernandez had been deceived, like so many FDA investigators before him.「At last my conscious did not allow me to keep quiet as its a matter of health of people. Ranbaxy has been hiding many facts till now.」

Sunny went on,「What you see at these locations is not the real stuff. It requires a minimum of one month to find out the real matter.」He described how the company’s top managers exerted relentless pressure on lower-level employees and forced them to clear crucial medicines — isotretinoin, gabapentin, flucanozole, metformin — for release. All had「issues but they are dispatched from the site by QA [quality assurance].」He named senior executives who had orchestrated the scheme:「Over the years they have all bluffed and fooled the FDA.」

Sunny explained that before Hernandez arrived at Paonta Sahib, a team of twenty people from research and development had descended on the plant to review and alter data.「This cleanup was done just before the FDA inspection,」he wrote.「Such thing is done routinely at all the plants at Ranbaxy.」Executives stage-managed the deceptions at the direction of top company leaders, he explained, with lower-level employees carrying out their orders under duress. To support the claim that the company had increased staffing at its stability lab, it had shifted employees from around the plant to that lab during Hernandez’s inspection.

As the whistleblowers’ revelations spread among FDA officials, regulators were surprised by Ranbaxy’s duplicity, in part because it was difficult to fathom the extent of it. The FDA was confronting a system in which data had been so artfully altered that everything seemed perfect. Until then, despite the evidence that had emerged from the search warrant, they had thought of fraud as discrete acts committed by individuals. But what if the way the entire company operated was fraudulent? How could they pierce a scheme of lies that all the employees were in on?

As the FDA descended on Ranbaxy facilities, investigators suddenly noticed everywhere the clues they had previously walked by: the use of unapproved materials; the secret changes in formulation; the use of unregistered active ingredients; the plagiarism of already published data, down to copying chromatograms, or the graphs measuring impurities from brand-name drugs, and passing them off as the company’s own. The company seemed to have sprung a leak, with at least half a dozen whistleblowers now writing in to the agency with their own examples of fraud and misconduct.

Sunny continued to write, and Hernandez soon put him in touch with Debbie Robertson, who was leading the probe at the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. Sunny revealed that Ranbaxy, unable to find a legitimate fix for its troubled Sotret drug, had secretly altered the formulation while it was on the market, adding oil to the wax base to try to improve the drug’s dissolution. None of this had been reported to the FDA, making it an egregious violation. Companies were strictly prohibited from making any changes to approved formulations without the FDA’s permission.

Another whistleblower also flagged the Sotret and urged the agency to check the difference in the formulations of the drug before and after December 2006, when the switch was made.「Some scientists wanted to address the issue earlier during 2005 and early 2006 but the commercial staff was ruthless with them,」the whistleblower wrote to CDER’s ombudsman.「They really have no appreciation for the honest people. I don’t know the harm that must have been caused to U.S. users but being part of the [manufacturing] team, I thought as a good world citizen, I must bring this to your notice.」

It seemed there was almost nothing the company wouldn’t do or say, no excuse it wouldn’t make, no claim too far-fetched, to trick the agency into approving its drugs. Instead of investigating its own out-of-specification results, as required, Ranbaxy claimed that its own lab had mishandled samples, which had erroneously led to poor test results. Sometimes it seemed that Ranbaxy was better at making excuses than it was at making drugs. As one FDA regulator urged her colleagues, the company’s「discrepancies, inconsistencies, mistakes, oversights and poorly executed investigations」were not to be taken at face value. The lies were so audacious that Debbie Robertson would later say that she had never encountered anything like it:「In all my years [investigating] drug dealers, I had never had that blatant disregard for the law. They lied right to your face. I was told, it’s a cultural thing. They understood, but they knew they could get away with it.」

The only answer to this global malfeasance seemed to be global punishment. And the agency had a rarely used remedy, one of the most onerous punishments it could inflict: an Application Integrity Policy (AIP), which it had imposed on only four drug companies since the policy was first established in 1991. The AIP allowed the FDA to halt all review of a company’s applications, to be resumed only after outside auditors — hired at the company’s expense — certified that the data was legitimate. The sanction would flip the regulatory dynamic. No longer would the FDA have the burden of proving fraud if it wanted to block a Ranbaxy product. Instead, in order to get its products approved, the company would have to prove that its products weren’t fraudulent.

The agency imposed an AIP only when it had found criminality or「untrue statements of material fact,」which it clearly had in Ranbaxy’s case, or so Doug Campbell believed. He had drafted a memorandum lining up the various falsehoods that regulators had been able to document. He proposed that CDER impose the AIP for「all approved and pending applications related to Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.」In short, bring the hammer down on the entire company.

But as drafts circulated and meetings gave way to more meetings, Campbell began to doubt his own ability to communicate. Nothing seemed to rise to the requisite level of proof. No one seemed exactly sure if the AIP was merited or even defensible. The FDA was crowded with lawyers who seemed more intent on heading off court challenges from companies than on protecting public health. The agency’s lawyers debated the FDA’s requirements. Did it say anywhere that companies could not keep drugs in unregistered refrigerators? If the company claimed that it had lost raw data, was there any written requirement that they keep it forever?

Even the FDA’s own role seemed unclear. Was it the agency’s job to help Ranbaxy comply? Or to cut off the company for failing to do so? Shocked by the internal dithering, Campbell jotted in his notebook,「Our goal cannot be to make it easy on Ranbaxy!」But in fact, that seemed to be the case. There was intense congressional and public pressure to find more cheap drugs. Ranbaxy also played a crucial role in providing AIDS drugs to Africa under the government’s PEPFAR program. Was Ranbaxy simply too big, or too important, to fail?

The FDA’s confusion over its own enforcement mission was not the only problem.「There was some force holding this case down,」Campbell would later conclude. Did it have to do with money? With connections? With political sway? He grew suspicious, particularly when some of the FDA’s Indian employees who’d never come to his office before seemed to find any excuse to visit him.

Then there was Deb Autor. As an attorney who headed CDER’s Office of Compliance, she sat a number of levels above him in the FDA bureaucracy and oversaw the work of some four thousand employees. Before she’d joined the federal government in 1995, she’d worked for three years at the law firm that became Buc & Beardsley, which was now representing Ranbaxy. As such, she was on a first-name basis with the partner who served as Ranbaxy’s outside counsel, Kate Beardsley.

Beardsley turned to Autor as her direct conduit to the workings of the case, calling and emailing to get insight into the government’s progress and trying, whenever possible, to move forward decisions that would be helpful to her client. Autor prodded the bureaucracy at Beardsley’s behest, an effort that she viewed as part of her FDA role: to respond to lawyers whose clients had matters pending before the agency. Autor had left the firm thirteen years before the FDA’s compliance office began considering the Ranbaxy case. But to Campbell, it seemed that sometimes Autor was more focused on assisting her former boss than on helping to advance the agency’s case against Ranbaxy.

Beardsley wrote to Autor in March 2007:「Deb, I left you a phone message, but thought it would be sensible to send you an email too asking if you could give me a call about Ranbaxy. We’re still trying to sort things out on the civil side, as they are also trying to cope with the criminal side.」

Autor responded,「Hi Kate. I’m happy to call you. But it seems like I know enough about your concerns to follow-up around here first and get back to you. Okay?」

In December, in another email, Beardsley contacted her again, to explain the delays on releasing the Parexel audits in their entirety and asking that Autor call her. Two hours later, Autor told her colleagues via email,「Ranbaxy needs to think through the implications for the criminal case of providing the audits. Please consider whether you can provide Ranbaxy with Doug’s 12/6/07 list of questions in order to give them more information about what GMP issues are still troubling us.」Given the overlapping connections and bureaucratic foot-dragging, Campbell found it hard to distinguish who was working for the FDA from who was working against it. As the case became increasingly fractious, Campbell hesitated to disclose things to Autor.

Even if agency regulators had not dragged their feet, they faced a problem without an obvious solution: how could they verify that a company was making the changes it claimed to be making in factories that were over seven thousand miles away?

In an email to Robertson, the whistleblower Sunny described how Ranbaxy used hidden areas of the plant to store and cover up testing machines that were not connected to the company’s main computer network. He was referring to the crucial high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) machines, the workhorses of any good testing laboratory. The bulky machines looked like a stack of computer printers. Once a drug sample is mixed with a solvent, injected into the machine, and pressed through a column filled with granular material, the machine separates out and measures the drug’s components, including impurities. It displays them as a series of peaks on a graph called a chromatogram.

In a compliant laboratory, HPLC machines would be networked with the main computer system, making all their data visible and preserved. During a recent inspection, Sunny wrote, the unauthorized HPLC machines were kept in two ancillary labs:「Ranbaxy creates small such hidden areas where these manipulations can be done.」

Sunny estimated that some thirty products on the U.S. market did not pass specifications and advised Robertson that the agency needed to raid Paonta Sahib and Dewas, just as it had done in New Jersey, to find the evidence. He warned,「The move has already started in Ranbaxy to share such details of problematic products personally and not on emails or letters.」

But because the U.S. Attorney had no jurisdiction in India, the FDA couldn’t execute a search warrant there. Robertson felt thwarted:「People said, ‘You need to go to India.’」But her response was,「What am I going to do [over there], knock on people’s doors and hope they talk to me? I don’t have authority over in India. It’s all a voluntary, good-faith system.」The case had crashed like a wrecking ball into the overtaxed agency, exposing the fact that the FDA had no effective way to police a foreign drug company.

In November 2007, as the FDA prepared to inspect a factory at Ranbaxy’s Dewas site that made sterile injectable products to consider whether to approve its drugs for the U.S. market, Sunny emailed Robertson his most important tip yet. The FDA’s regulations required the facility to have one of the highest levels of sterility possible. But, Sunny warned Robertson,「the microbiological data is not actual and is manipulated to show less microbial counts,」adding that the plant had had several unreported sterility failures. He advised,「Be careful before approving this facility.」

A month before the FDA’s inspection, Sunny wrote again to Robertson to alert her to a cover-up in progress:「all the actual failure data of Environment monitoring and sterility failures」were being moved out of the Dewas plant to a warehouse fifteen miles away, in Raokheri. Sunny advised that those inside the plant「will try their best to confuse the auditors and they are trained for the same. People in QA have been told to keep their mouth shut about the deviations.」

The international compliance team members knew that if they wanted to get the evidence that microbial test results had been manipulated, they needed to go, unannounced, to the Raokheri warehouse. Rivera-Martinez submitted the team’s request to do that. But the answer he got back was not what he had expected. In a terse email marked「confidential,」Patricia Alcock, then deputy director in the Division of Field Investigations, wrote:「Please check your voicemail message. The warehouse is off the table.」

Alcock explained in her voicemail that an unannounced inspection could jeopardize ongoing diplomatic efforts between the FDA’s parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Indian health authorities. The two sides were negotiating a written statement of cooperation that might one day enhance the quality of FDA-regulated products made in India. To accomplish even a draft statement, HHS officials wanted to avoid angering the Indians.

Rivera-Martinez was outraged. He prepared an email to Alcock that he shared with colleagues, challenging the refusal. He stressed the seriousness of the allegations. If「true [they] raise significant questions regarding the corporation’s compliance attitude, adequacy of the firm’s quality management system, and manufacturing state of control.」He reminded Alcock that just last month, in a briefing to the staff of Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) on what it was doing to strengthen foreign inspections, the FDA had even pledged to conduct them unannounced. In their congressional briefing, FDA officials had acknowledged that there was no legal requirement to notify foreign facilities in advance.

Rivera-Martinez’s office deemed an unannounced inspection of the warehouse to be「both warranted and necessary.」Armed with another email from Sunny about up-to-the-minute manipulations of data, Rivera-Martinez wrote to his superiors:「FYI, here’s another e-mail from the informant regarding Ranbaxy’s keen ability to manage our inspections and investigators. It’s quite clear to me that we have to consider different and bold inspection/investigative strategies and techniques in dealing with Ranbaxy to increase our chances of uncovering evidence of data falsification/manipulation. . . . That’s why I’m insisting on an unannounced inspection of the warehouse.」

Rivera-Martinez was insisting on common sense. But this time he heard back from the deputy associate commissioner for compliance policy in the Regulatory Affairs Office, who also nixed the warehouse inspection. The deputy explained the thinking of senior FDA officials:「We agreed that any unannounced inspections in a foreign country [need] to be well thought through and planned with all parties to ensure investigator safety and that we minimize the potential that any adverse international incident occurs. Since no such planning had taken place by the time the inspection team left, we agreed that no unannounced inspection would take place this trip.」So because of the risk of international conflict that might scuttle a diplomatic effort, the FDA would not fully and unreservedly investigate foreign facilities that presented potential threats to U.S. public health. The needs of patients came last.

Instead, while at Dewas, the investigators requested a visit to the Raokheri warehouse. They were taken there the following day and spent eight hours rummaging through drawers and boxes. As Alcock informed Rivera-Martinez, they「didn’t find anything pertinent or as described by the informant.」The whistleblower Sunny later told Robertson that「just before the inspection somebody inside alerted to move unaccounted material from the Raokheri warehouse.」

But the company could not conceal a more startling problem at the supposedly sterile facility. As Alcock conveyed to her colleagues,「The building . . . is surrounded by pig farms. [The investigator also observed] a lack of instructions/procedures advising personnel to wash their hands/feet before entering the sterile core. (Many of the workers wear sandals. . . . There are also a tremendous amount of pigs scattered on/near the facility???).」

The FDA did not approve the sterile facility. But as agency regulators continued to approve other Ranbaxy applications, their permissive approach seemed increasingly unsustainable. Toward the end of 2007, Deb Autor learned that a different federal agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), was considering terminating Ranbaxy as a provider of low-cost drugs to Africa. Instead of applauding the aggressive action, Autor expressed concern that such a clear rebuke of the company would make the FDA’s regulators look bad. It would raise「questions about why FDA has not shut down Ranbaxy,」she warned her bosses. She offered to take up this question in person or by phone. One of those copied on the email advised colleagues,「Keep this information to yourselves.」

On December 12, 2007, USAID sent a stern letter to Ranbaxy. It accused the company of delaying reporting negative test results to the FDA.「I am very troubled by this apparent lack of business integrity and honesty by a company performing on a subcontract funded by the U.S. Government,」the letter stated. It was signed by the acting director of the Office of Acquisition and Assistance and stated that USAID was considering suspending or debarring Ranbaxy from the program. By contrast, the FDA seemed more comfortable to continue its accustomed approach:「Regulators were perfectly happy to stall and stall,」Campbell recalled.

By early 2008, Ranbaxy had submitted an application for approval of a plant called Batamandi, in Himachal Pradesh. It proposed to make sensitive drugs there, including tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant used by transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. The application caused immediate suspicion among Campbell and his colleagues. Batamandi was close enough to Paonta Sahib to possibly be a part of it. Was Ranbaxy trying to pass off a part of Paonta Sahib as a new plant as a way to evade the agency’s restrictions there?

As was customary, the agency ordered a preapproval inspection for the manufacture of tacrolimus at the Batamandi facility. But there was nothing ordinary about the assignment. Jose Hernandez was tapped to go. In early March, he arrived at Batamandi, armed with his「broad scope of thinking,」as he liked to put it, and a determination not to be fooled again. As was typical, Hernandez began his inspection outside, taking in the grounds. By standing at the edge of the property, he could see the Paonta Sahib plant, about two and a half miles away. He noted an eight-foot-high fence that surrounded almost all of the Batamandi plant. There was only one entryway, secured by a well-staffed guard post. The guards there, former military policemen, seemed proud to confirm that they logged all employees and visitors in and out through the gate. No one got past them.

This gave Hernandez the opportunity he needed. By examining checkpoint records at the gate, he learned that the supervisors who had signed off as present for the manufacturing of key tacrolimus batches had not actually been at the plant on those days. They had not signed in to the security gate logs. The dates, times, and signatures of the batch records were fake and had been filled in after the fact. One evening at his hotel, where other Ranbaxy executives who had flown in for his inspection were also staying, Hernandez cornered one of them and said,「When Catholics do something bad, they go to the priest and confess. Now, think that I am the priest and take this opportunity to tell me who was involved in creating the fraudulent data.」

They did not confess then and there. But by the end of his inspection, while at the closeout meeting at the plant, the managers essentially admitted that the company was trying to rush Batamandi into operation to circumvent the FDA’s restrictions on Paonta Sahib.

Hernandez explained to Ranbaxy’s senior executives that he was planning to recommend against approving the plant. The company’s senior vice president for global manufacturing, who’d arrived to oversee the inspection, took him aside. He became「agitated and desperate,」Hernandez documented. The vice president admitted that the plant’s construction had been rushed and mistakes had been made. Over and over, the man pledged to correct anything Hernandez wanted, but begged the investigator not to use the word「falsified」in his report.

The FDA refused to certify Batamandi as a separate plant, and Ranbaxy withdrew its tacrolimus application. It was yet another round in a global game of whack-a-mole. Each time the FDA found fraud inside Ranbaxy, it responded with a small regulatory restriction, only to find fraud pop up somewhere else. The agency had done nothing yet to clamp down on Ranbaxy’s entire method of operating. But the game was about to change.

## 0404. Diamond and Ruby

OCTOBER 2007

New Delhi, India

Malvinder Singh’s year had gotten off to a bad start. Unlike his father — a visionary who built institutions and legacies — Singh saw his primary role as creating value for shareholders. As he told India’s business press,「I am an entrepreneur at heart and value-creation is the ultimate objective of any true-blue entrepreneur.」

But creating lasting value was not as easy as it seemed. When he took over the company in 2006, the young CEO quickly ran through his MBA playbook — aggressively seeking acquisitions and alliances. But even though he succeeded in generating buzz, Ranbaxy’s bottom line was「sagging,」according to AsiaMoney. Ranbaxy had to withdraw its bid to buy Germany’s biggest generic drug company. Then there was the FDA. In his view, the American regulators were a sour lot — unmoved by his pledge of reform and the company’s face-saving gestures.

In Malvinder’s India, you could almost always make a problem go away, whether through strategic payments or the threat of force. Just five months earlier, Malvinder’s brother, Shivinder, blocked a high-profile cardiac surgeon who opposed him in a business deal from reentering a New Delhi hospital the Singh family owned. The surgeon arrived at work to encounter almost one hundred policemen and a full battalion of Rapid Action Force servicemen, armed with tear gas and a water tanker used for riot control.

But in the United States, there was no vigilante army to summon and the FDA was refusing to budge. As Ranbaxy’s largest shareholders, the Singh brothers found that the problems had begun to take a toll on their bottom line. Amid these concerns, Malvinder paid close attention to an intriguing message from one of the company’s advisers in New York. A fellow named Tsutomu Une, from the Japanese drug company Daiichi Sankyo, wanted to speak to him about a strategic partnership. Malvinder sensed opportunity.

In Tokyo, four thousand miles away from New Delhi, Dr. Une looked around the world for new revenue streams. As senior executive officer of global corporate strategy for Daiichi Sankyo, Japan’s second-largest drug company, Une wanted to penetrate far-flung markets, like India and eastern Europe, in which his company had never set foot. He needed a low-cost, big-volume partner. His eye kept landing on Ranbaxy.

Une, a sixty-year-old microbiologist, had come up through the ranks of pharmaceutical innovation. He had been at Daiichi Pharmaceutical Company for more than thirty years and continued his rise after the company’s 2005 merger with the Sankyo Company. Gentlemanly and formal, Une maintained a careful journal of his work life.

More than other countries, Japan was a brand-loving society that viewed generics as untrustworthy. The nation was devoted to quality and cleanliness. Though once scorned for poor quality, its modern-day pharmaceutical industry enjoyed a worldwide reputation as a leader in quality controls. The pills even had to be white, or patients regarded them with suspicion. Though Une was a product of that trademark caution, he recognized that the insular nature of Japan’s drug industry and its focus on high-cost research had led to a slowdown in growth.

From his perspective, Ranbaxy — with manufacturing plants in eleven countries and sales in 125 countries — was enticing. It had numerous first-to-file drug applications pending in the United States, including for generic Lipitor, which would be the most lucrative generic drug launch in history. Daiichi Sankyo wanted a stable of low-cost drug products to help create a flow of revenue in between the blockbusters. To that end, Ranbaxy might be the perfect partner for an alliance. If an acquisition could be done quickly, it could help prop up Daiichi Sankyo’s battered share price before the next quarterly investors’ meeting.

In Japan’s boardrooms, decision-making tended to be consensus-driven, so Une would have to convince his colleagues. But as Daiichi Sankyo’s president, Takashi Shoda, had told his colleagues,「India will be the trump card allowing a Japanese pharmaceutical firm to go global.」The idea was in the air.

Une, sensitive to cultural implications, knew the matter would be a delicate one. Ranbaxy was not just any Indian company. It was a cultural institution, built by the eminent Singh family and handed down for three generations. It was now in the hands of a Singh scion, an American-educated MBA little more than half his age. But Une’s standing was high within Daiichi Sankyo, his vision respected, and his business acumen proven. And so, in early October 2007, he made his first approach, contacting one of Ranbaxy’s external advisers in New York.

Within three weeks of their first conversation, Une and Malvinder met. Une, his silver hair combed neatly back, spoke in thickly accented English. Malvinder — with his polished diction, bespoke suit, and elegant turban with matching handkerchief — was the picture of composure. Their negotiations moved swiftly, and the men scheduled a follow-up meeting in New Delhi. Une and Malvinder proceeded with utmost secrecy, using the code names「Diamond」for Daiichi Sankyo and「Ruby」for Ranbaxy in internal reports and correspondence. They also agreed on a cover story for their upcoming meetings. If the press inquired, they would claim to be in discussion about a contract manufacturing agreement. Those were a dime a dozen and wouldn’t attract the scrutiny of the business press.

Little more than four months after Une’s first contact, conversations had escalated well beyond a strategic partnership to negotiations over an outright sale. The Japanese microbiologist and the young Indian billionaire were haggling over share price and terms. But Une was concerned by the regulatory cloud that hovered over Ranbaxy. In emails back and forth, Une, guided by his lawyers, kept pressing Ranbaxy to make typical warranties, representations, and indemnities explicit, which would allow Daiichi Sankyo to sue for breach of contract if Ranbaxy’s financial health was not as Malvinder warranted. Malvinder kept deflecting his requests. Finally, on a call, Une told him,「My colleagues are frustrated by your ‘Don’t worry’ type answers to our questions.」In a second call the same day, Malvinder, in his melodic and steady voice, moved to reassure the scientist:「There is no fear or fault in Ruby.」

But Une had unresolved questions. It was public knowledge that federal agents had raided Ranbaxy’s U.S. headquarters in February and issued warning letters against two of its key plants, Paonta Sahib and Dewas. But no one knew how serious the investigation was, or how deep the company’s potential liability went. Malvinder had asked Une on the phone,「What are your concerns?」

Une could only guess what prosecutors working for the formidable U.S. Justice Department and the world’s toughest regulators at the FDA were probing. It would be the job of his advisers to find out. In less than a month, Malvinder and Une met secretly in Delhi, this time with their lawyers and a small coterie of top executives. Une made clear that whatever lay at the bottom of the various U.S. investigations into the company would be critical to whether Daiichi Sankyo moved ahead. Malvinder appeared unruffled and pledged help and candor with the process. He agreed to set up a due diligence meeting in which all documents relevant to the investigations would be disclosed to Daiichi Sankyo.

The young CEO then appeared to take Une into his confidence and explained what was really driving the investigations: Pfizer was retaliating against Ranbaxy for having prevailed in the Lipitor patent litigation and, through sleight-of-hand, had unleashed the investigators. As Une considered this explanation, Ranbaxy’s intellectual property lawyer, Jay Deshmukh, among a handful of top advisers present, sat stone-faced and silent.

Despite Malvinder’s blithe assurance that there was no「fear or fault」in Ranbaxy, the company was essentially a powder keg. As Malvinder well knew, the company’s dark secrets had been memorialized in the potent document known inside the company as the Self-Assessment Report (SAR), the blistering PowerPoint that Rajinder Kumar had shown to the board.

Had the document been destroyed, Malvinder wouldn’t have been in this position. But he believed that the U.S. government had it, and it had served as a magnet for prosecutors and regulators. Ranbaxy’s external lawyers had made it vividly clear to Malvinder that the company would not move past its troubles with the U.S. government until it righted the wrongs described in the SAR. And though the SAR did not address the authenticity of the data used for U.S. drugs, government prosecutors had quite logically inferred that, if so many of the company’s drugs were fraudulent, there was no reason to trust any of them.

Just weeks after Malvinder’s disastrous meeting with the FDA, lawyer Kate Beardsley, who had helped Ranbaxy navigate the FDA for years, got on a plane to New Delhi. She spoke with Malvinder specifically about the SAR. Until the company dealt with it, she told him, its FDA problems were likely to persist. There was only one way forward: to withdraw each drug and each dossier flagged as having false data and then retest and resubmit them, just as Kumar had proposed two years earlier at the ill-fated board meeting. The situation required global remediation, Beardsley told him.

If there was any lingering doubt as to whether the government had the SAR, the February 2007 search warrant in New Jersey erased it. Ranbaxy’s lawyers learned that it had been in the trove of documents that FDA agents hauled from Abha Pant’s office. The next month, in a meeting near Heathrow Airport in London, Beardsley again raised the topic of the documents, this time with Deshmukh and former CEO Brian Tempest, who remained a company adviser. A new outside attorney, Christopher Mead, a partner with London & Mead, which had been hired by Ranbaxy to deal with the growing Justice Department investigation, also attended the meeting. A veteran former prosecutor, Mead had immediately understood the significance of the SAR. Not only had this confession of fraud by executives in the company probably ignited the Justice Department investigation, but the document also opened the door to prosecution of individual company executives. The alarm was such that, in a phone call, Deshmukh warned Tempest against traveling to the United States, where he could be subject to arrest.

In June 2007, Mead sat down with Malvinder and told him that he’d gotten two letters from the Justice Department, asking for documents related to the SAR. Mead was nothing if not emphatic. The SAR was so serious and reflected such a culture of corruption that the company had to address the concerns it raised head on. Until it did so, the government was unlikely to relent.

But as Ranbaxy and Daiichi Sankyo got closer to a deal, Malvinder had a different concern about the SAR. It had attracted regulators and prosecutors but would almost certainly repel the Japanese and jeopardize the deal with Daiichi Sankyo. He would need a way to make the documents vanish in plain sight. Malvinder’s trusted deputies fabricated the minutes of the 2004 board meeting, so they bore no reference to Kumar’s presentation.

Malvinder also managed to wear Une down in his insistence on contractual safeguards. With the argument that contracts were usually different in India, he’d gotten Une to accept a single representation and warranty that Ranbaxy was as sound an investment as he’d portrayed. That guarantee would come from Ranbaxy, not from Malvinder personally. However, Une had been warned by advisers not to buy the company without proper due diligence regarding the U.S. government’s investigations. It was advice he intended to heed.

In general, Une’s approach, as a Daiichi Sankyo lawyer summarized it to a consultant at the time, was,「if we show our best efforts, sincerity and reasonableness on the coming negotiation, they also will show their best efforts, sincerity and reasonableness to us.」The consultant wrote back,「We have been too trusting of Ruby, and they have taken full advantage of that.」Jay Deshmukh would later observe that the two cultures were like「oil and water.」Indians succeeded in business by being「ultra-aggressive,」he said.「Ethics are not important.」By contrast, the Japanese were「very trusting. Babes in the woods.」

Inside Ranbaxy, Malvinder put Deshmukh in charge of the due diligence process. As they prepared for a major meeting with Daiichi Sankyo, Singh gave him explicit instructions: do not mention the SAR or any of its repercussions. Deshmukh balked, but ultimately made clear that he would follow orders, and he advised the external lawyers not to mention the SAR to Daiichi Sankyo under any circumstance. Other Ranbaxy executives were instructed not to speak with Daiichi Sankyo executives at all, but to communicate with them through Malvinder’s executive assistant. Malvinder would later deny any misrepresentation or concealment of information from Daiichi Sankyo, saying that all relevant information about Ranbaxy was in the public domain.

Though Abha Pant was tapped to speak about the FDA warning letters at the upcoming meeting, Malvinder’s personal attorney advised her to say nothing about the SAR. This lockdown was possible, in part, because Malvinder had surrounded himself with a handpicked group of loyalists who had ties to his family and to the spiritual organization so interwoven in the family’s affairs. They sat in on almost every early phone call Malvinder had with Une.

On May 26, 2008, Malvinder, Deshmukh, and Une met in New Delhi, accompanied by top executives and lawyers from both sides. To ensure that Deshmukh wouldn’t waver in his pledge, he was given a script that Malvinder had signed off on to follow throughout the meeting. It made no mention of the SAR or its connection to the government investigations. The script put Deshmukh in a box. He could only tell Daiichi Sankyo that the FDA and DOJ investigations were routine and dealt with different, unrelated issues and that the allegations Ranbaxy faced were unlikely to result in major liability.

By agreement, Ranbaxy had set up a data room where Daiichi Sankyo’s lawyers could review documents that included communications from U.S. prosecutors. But documents that mentioned the SAR had been removed from the stacks of materials. The two letters from the Justice Department asking for related documents had also been excluded.

Weeks later, in an executive meeting with Malvinder in London, Deshmukh was thunderstruck to learn that the Japanese were to become Ranbaxy’s majority shareholder. Until then, he believed the two companies were negotiating a manufacturing agreement, rather than an outright sale. He’d been kept in the dark. Once Deshmukh understood that an acquisition was being negotiated, suppressing information not only felt unjust. It seemed fraudulent.

Afterward, Deshmukh sought out Kate Beardsley for legal advice about his responsibility for deliberately withholding information from Daiichi Sankyo. Distraught, he told her that he was suffering a「crisis of conscience.」Beardsley said that she couldn’t advise Deshmukh personally, as her client was Ranbaxy. But Malvinder’s directive to withhold information about the SAR was so serious that she consulted with her law partner about whether it was even possible to continue representing Ranbaxy. They concluded that if Daiichi Sankyo contacted them with questions about the government’s investigation, they would have to resign rather than lie.

But Daiichi Sankyo never contacted them. Within weeks, the Japanese company had signed the agreement to become Ranbaxy’s majority shareholder and retain Malvinder as CEO for five years. At a press conference in June 2008, Malvinder stunned the Indian business world by announcing that he and his brother, Shivinder, had agreed to sell their 34 percent stake in Ranbaxy to the Japanese for an astonishing `$2` billion. The Japanese would then purchase additional shares to bring their controlling ownership to just over 50 percent of the company.

Malvinder called the sale an「emotional decision,」but one that would enhance the value of both companies and leave Ranbaxy debt-free. Just because he was no longer a shareholder, he said,「the visions, the dreams, the aspirations, none of that is going to change.」He faced fierce criticism that he’d betrayed national entrepreneurial pride by selling Ranbaxy to the Japanese.「Ranbaxy was the all-conquering Indian hero and should have been the last man standing instead of being the first to capitulate,」a former Ranbaxy executive told the Economic Times.

Malvinder had capitulated just in time.

One month later, on July 3, 2008, the Maryland U.S. Attorney filed an explosive motion in district court, shocking both FDA bureaucrats and Ranbaxy executives. The motion, which was public, demanded that the court force Ranbaxy to turn over the Parexel audits, which had been subpoenaed seven months earlier. In one sense, the motion was procedural. But the language was a knockout punch. The motion described a「pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct by the company」and noted that ongoing violations by Ranbaxy「continue to result in the introduction of adulterated and misbranded products into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead.」

Inside the FDA, the mood among frustrated bureaucrats was jubilant. Even if their own agency hadn’t yet taken action, prosecutors had. Edwin Rivera-Martinez emailed his team members:「This is the best news I’ve received in a long time! Finally, after waiting for so long and so much time and effort dedicated to this case . . . we are seeing the fruits of our efforts.」The usually understated bureaucrat signed off:「Enjoy the rest of your weekend if you can calm down.」

The motion set off a firestorm of questions from public health experts, congressional investigators, and foreign regulators, who were suddenly reevaluating some of their own Ranbaxy inspections. Even Ranbaxy’s own consultants were confounded. If the FDA had so clearly identified a company-wide culture of corruption, why did it continue to approve the company’s applications, product by product, and the company’s manufacturing plants, site by site?

Deb Autor, the director of CDER’s compliance office, sent around a blog post written by a former FDA employee with thirty-eight years of experience at the agency, headlined,「It’s Time for FDA to Block All Ranbaxy Products.」The post stated,「Until [Ranbaxy] can prove to FDA that these record problems are not part of a corporate culture, I feel that FDA should just inform Ranbaxy that all of their products offered entry into the U.S., regardless of plant involved in the actual production, will be refused entry.」It’s what the FDA compliance officer Doug Campbell had been saying all along. The post concluded that it would be a「start for the FDA toward regarding the American consumer as a ‘customer’ deserving protection, rather than continuing to reserve this policy for industry.」Autor appended a terse note, written in bold, to her email:「Further discussion if any should be in person, not by e-mail.」

Ultimately, it was neither the risk to public health nor the company’s ongoing obstruction that motivated the agency to act. Two weeks after prosecutors filed their motion, an email with the subject line「Heads Up xx」landed in the inboxes of senior FDA officials. It came from an attorney in the chief counsel’s office and noted:「I have been advised that Congress may soon be vigorously inquiring why FDA did not seek to bar the importation of Ranbaxy drugs made in India that are alleged to have been made under fraudulent conditions.」

The prospect of congressional questions set off alarm bells within the agency. Doug Campbell was in Poland, inspecting a drug plant, when his cell phone rang. It was Deb Autor. She had never contacted him directly before. Now she was focused on guarding the agency’s flanks and wanted to know:「What are we doing with Ranbaxy?」Campbell told Autor the truth:「We’re not doing anything.」Three days later, Campbell got new marching orders from an official by email:「Be prepared. Ranbaxy is your only priority right now.」

As though in preparation for questions from Congress, an internal summary of steps the agency had taken related to Ranbaxy began circulating among top officials. It played down the findings at Paonta Sahib, explaining that they did not justify restricting the importation of products made there. The summary noted that the agency had refused to approve some of Ranbaxy’s applications — but made no mention of the twenty-seven others it had approved since Thakur had first reported the fraud in 2005. It also noted that five inspections「have not found evidence to substantiate the informant allegations relating to bioequivalence testing,」a shading of the truth at best.

The memo concluded that appropriate next steps had been a difficult judgment call and had triggered scientific disagreement within CDER. This made it sound as though the agency had been actively wrestling with the case as a prelude to taking action, rather than simply sleeping on it. But in its own ponderous manner — facing the specter of congressional oversight — the agency was finally gearing up for action.

## 0405. You Just Don’t Get It

JULY 2008

New Delhi, India

As the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office filed its motion, alleging a「pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct,」Malvinder Singh faced his sharpest crisis yet. Questions loomed about Ranbaxy’s integrity, and the company’s stock price fell. The deal with Daiichi Sankyo had not been completed yet, and Malvinder needed a way to salvage it.

In a cagey call with reporters, Malvinder went public with his allegations of a conspiracy that he had previously shared with Tsutomu Une.「People are trying to create confusion and obviously somebody is trying to bring our price down so that they can [buy] at a lower price,」he told investors.「A multinational [company] and a leading Indian company are working in concert to bring our share price down,」he claimed, without offering any proof. Malvinder said Daiichi Sankyo was「aware of these issues while conducting due diligence. There is no change in the deal and there is no exit clause in it.」

Inside Ranbaxy, the principals huddled. They attended a meeting in Malvinder’s office marked「VIMP」(very important) in their calendars. The first agenda item:「Self assessment.」Almost everything aside from the SAR could be explained away, but that document alone would expose Malvinder’s claims as a lie.

The sense of crisis, and the phalanx of outside law firms to help manage it, was growing by the day. In late July 2008, company lawyer Jay Deshmukh traveled with the outside lawyer Chris Mead to a meeting at Ranbaxy headquarters that included Malvinder and other senior management, as well as two other external lawyers: Beardsley, the company’s longtime FDA lawyer, and Raymond Shepherd from Venable, brought in to deal with the new problem of scrutiny from the U.S. Congress. They needed a strategy to respond to the increasing tide of problems. In the car on the way to the meeting, Deshmukh confided in Mead that Daiichi Sankyo had not been told about the SAR because Malvinder would not allow it. Mead was furious.

At the meeting, the SAR again dominated the conversation. It became infuriatingly clear to Mead that the company had done little to respond to the allegations laid out in the SAR. He had learned, from a report Pant created, that the company continued to ship over sixty products that had been approved based on fake data. He was so frustrated that he pounded his fist on the conference table and shouted at Malvinder,「You just don’t get it!」He insisted that Ranbaxy stop shipping such products immediately, advice that Beardsley seconded. Mead explained that until the company fully dealt with the SAR, the government would not yield. Malvinder appeared to acquiesce and agreed to withdraw all affected products from global markets. Both Mead and Deshmukh urged him to disclose the SAR to Daiichi Sankyo. Malvinder responded,「I will deal with the Japanese.」

Among Ranbaxy executives, this came to be known as the「You just don’t get it」meeting. Malvinder did take one clear step after that meeting: he let go Mead’s firm and brought in another to deal with the Justice Department.

As Ranbaxy executives battled their own lawyers, FDA officials were preparing to take action. On September 16, 2008, just two months after prosecutors filed their motion, the agency announced that it was stopping the import of more than thirty drugs from two Ranbaxy plants, Dewas and Paonta Sahib. It also unveiled new warning letters for each plant.「With this action we are sending a clear signal that drug products intended for use by American consumers must meet our standards of safety and quality,」said Dr. Janet Woodcock, CDER’s director, in a press release.

As the compliance staff paused for a moment to celebrate, FDA officials held a media briefing to explain their new get-tough stance toward Ranbaxy. They were blocking the importation of the drugs from two of Ranbaxy’s plants. However, they were not demanding that the drugs be recalled from U.S. pharmacy shelves. Characterizing the action against Ranbaxy as「proactive,」Deb Autor told reporters,「FDA has no reason to believe the drugs from these two plants already in the U.S. drug supply pose a safety problem.」Stating that FDA tests showed that Ranbaxy drugs met specifications, she added,「FDA has no evidence that these Ranbaxy products are actually defective. But the manufacturing process and control problems the FDA has found could impact product and for this reason FDA has taken these proactive steps.」

Autor had served as an agency representative. Her statements, as she later said,「were simply a reiteration of FDA’s official position, which was, as always, the result of a lengthy internal deliberation process involving many people throughout the organization.」Nonetheless, her statements sparked fury inside the agency. The criminal investigators and compliance staff convened to discuss their veracity and impact. The FDA knew that two of Ranbaxy’s drugs, Sotret and gabapentin, had failed quality tests and posed a potential danger to patients. If the drugs were not defective, then what was the problem, and what leverage did the FDA have? Campbell didn’t know what to think.「Apparently there’s an idea, we don’t want to create a panic. It’s a lawyer thing,」he said.「Lawyers don’t have the same kind of conscience.」

The statements had floated the company a life raft and made the work of agency investigators that much harder. For years to come, Ranbaxy would invoke them in its efforts to fend off the FDA. In the short term, however, the FDA’s announcement of import restrictions and warning letters triggered a crisis inside the company that played out on three continents.

On a conference call the day after the FDA’s get-tough announcement, Malvinder Singh continued to insist to Une that Ranbaxy had done nothing wrong. He told Une that he was「shocked」by the developments. He claimed that Ranbaxy had been fully cooperative and there was「no sign or omen」that the FDA had been dissatisfied with its efforts.

Remarkably, despite every warning sign, the deal between the two companies remained on track. Ranbaxy agreed to turn over to the Justice Department the audits prepared by its consultant, Parexel, in their entirety, and the U.S. government withdrew its motion to enforce the subpoena. Une continued to express confidence in Malvinder, noting in his journal,「[Malav-San] responded to our requests in good faith on each matter and prepared accordingly. Things have started to work well.」He even counseled himself to be culturally sensitive and not to harbor negative thoughts. In one entry, he wrote,「Malav-San’s response to requests in connection with the FDA are slow. I understand that it is in the middle of the most celebrated festival but . . . Patience!」

On November 7, 2008, Daiichi Sankyo and Ranbaxy closed their transaction. A month later, the Japanese took majority control of Ranbaxy’s board. In the blink of an eye, Malvinder and his brother had added over $2 billion to their own bottom lines, and Malvinder went on to become an employee of the Japanese. It was an odd arrangement fraught with risk. But Ranbaxy lawyer Jay Deshmukh had new hope. Now that Ranbaxy had agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department and turn over the Parexel audits, perhaps the company could swiftly reach a deal with prosecutors that would make concealment of the SAR irrelevant. His guilt over lying to Une might lift. It would all be behind them. In the meanwhile, Deshmukh was in a strange new world. There was no more shouting — or decisions by fiat — in interactions with the Japanese. They operated by consensus, he found. It seemed to him that ten people got on the phone and little got done.

Despite Ranbaxy’s lurching difficulties, Une was pleased enough. It was his deal, and he documented it closely.「Mr. Singh fits in well,」he noted in his journal. But he also noted, as he delved into the work for his monthly Ranbaxy meetings, that the discussions on how to resolve the company’s FDA issues were「all just the beginning of the beginning.」On February 19, 2009, Une traveled to New Delhi and met with Malvinder. He was sorting through a host of issues, including how to balance Malvinder’s autonomy with Daiichi Sankyo’s governance and trying to understand the chronology of Ranbaxy’s troubles with the FDA. Something didn’t quite add up, but he wasn’t sure what.

He was back in Tokyo on February 25 when he got news that came as a body blow. The FDA announced that it would level the harshest punishment available on Ranbaxy — an Application Integrity Policy. An AIP was the drug regulator’s version of a scarlet「A.」The agency imposed it only when it deemed a company’s applications to be largely fraudulent or unreliable. Now the company would have to prove its products weren’t fraudulent in order to get them approved.

The AIP covered all the products for the U.S. market that Ranbaxy manufactured at Paonta Sahib. The action left no doubt as to the depth and extent of the problem. The stock market responded accordingly. Ranbaxy shares fell 18 percent and took Daiichi Sankyo’s down 9 percent with them.「Crisis!」Une noted in his journal. A gentleman to the core, however, he did not at that moment second-guess his most prominent employee, as another executive might have done. Instead, Une wrote,「even though it is the problem of the management of Malav-San, now is the time to cheer him up. We can criticize later.」Both Ranbaxy and Daiichi Sankyo formed crisis response teams. Within three days, Une was on a plane to New Delhi. There, he made continued efforts to understand why the FDA had clobbered the company.

As Malvinder continued to play dumb, Une was left with a Delphic riddle of sorts. Why would the FDA deem the entire company dishonest if, as Malvinder claimed, Ranbaxy had done everything right? All Une could do was parse the clues in front of him. He was a careful observer and wrote in his journal about his meetings with Malvinder and his deputies:「What I found out is that they also do not understand the reason AIP was invoked. They are not aware that the entire system was deemed suspicious even though it was partially fixed. Malav-San joined [the meeting] at the end. Members’ tone changes. They are very much afraid of him.」

Inside Ranbaxy, the AIP had caused tensions to boil over. Jay Deshmukh was at his wits’ end. He’d participated in a fraud, under direct orders from his boss. Now that Daiichi Sankyo needed to take charge of the FDA and Justice Department problems, it had every right to know the truth about their origins. The ongoing suppression of the SAR and the deceit perpetrated against Une seemed more indefensible with every passing day. And though Deshmukh had been put nominally in charge of cleaning up the trail of fraudulent dossiers, Malvinder’s loyalists inside the company were blocking that effort at every turn. In meetings, Deshmukh openly began to voice his dismay, on occasion even threatening to personally disclose the SAR to Daiichi Sankyo, airing a view that others shared but refused to say aloud.

Finally, in early March 2009, the growing conflict between Deshmukh and Malvinder broke out into the open.「We don’t think you’re doing things the right way,」Deshmukh told Malvinder at an operational meeting in India, with over a dozen people present.

「I’m going to stop you right there,」Malvinder interrupted him.「Who’s we and who’s you?」

「We are the lawyers,」Deshmukh said.

「Jay, I am very upset with you,」Malvinder responded.「You’re now looking at we and you, us and them? You’re not one of us?」

「Take it the way you want,」Deshmukh retorted.「I want this thing cleaned up. And you’re not doing it. Your guys are refusing to do things that the compliance lawyers and I are insisting be done.」

Not long after that clash, Malvinder called Deshmukh, who’d returned to the United States, and told him,「I want you in India.」He directed him to take the next flight over. Within seventy-two hours, Malvinder was glaring at Deshmukh across his desk and gave him three choices: he could leave voluntarily with a negotiated settlement; he could relocate to India and work on intellectual property but nothing else; or he could be fired and leave on bad terms. Deshmukh asked for a day to think it over.

That night Deshmukh went out for a drink with trusted colleagues and blew off steam. He complained that the company’s fall was all due to Malvinder, and that he was screwing over Ranbaxy’s twelve thousand employees and all their dependents.「There’s not too many people who are the worst people on the face of the earth, but this guy is one,」he said. He threatened to disclose the SAR to Daiichi Sankyo.

In bitterness, he had said way too much. The next day Malvinder hauled Deshmukh back into his office. The head of human resources was seated beside him. The meeting got instantly ugly.「I heard what you said,」Malvinder said, meaning that the lawyer’s remarks over drinks the night before had been relayed to him. Malvinder then directed the human resources director to leave. He told Deshmukh that if he chose to release the SAR to Daiichi Sankyo, Malvinder could take matters into his own hands.「I know where you live,」Malvinder said.

Deshmukh refused to cower:「Of course you know where I live, you idiot. You’ve come to my house.」He added,「Why don’t you get your HR person back in here, so he can hear your threats?」He then pointed out that if Malvinder tried to harm him while he was in the United States,「it’s going to come back and bite you very hard.」He added, for good measure,「I think it’s safe to say my Shiv Sena connections won’t appreciate that.」Deshmukh’s second cousin had helped form the Shiv Sena, a fearsome right-wing Hindu nationalist party linked to political violence.

「You’re a womanizer,」Malvinder shot back.「I have all the records on you.」

The men continued to trade insults.「If your father was alive today, he’d be ashamed,」said Deshmukh.

It was the lawyer’s last day at Ranbaxy. Malvinder forced him to resign. As he later reflected on Ranbaxy’s conduct,「Honestly, once you get to the point where you actually wholesale make up data points, hundreds and thousands . . . of data points, what’s to keep you from doing anything?」The effort to deceive Une continued, over the protest of Ranbaxy’s external lawyers. Had the microbiologist known about the SAR, he could have instantly decrypted the company’s woes. But without that crucial information, all he could do was keep on sifting the clues.

Around the time that Deshmukh left the company, Une flew to New York for a meeting at Giuliani Partners, yet another external adviser that Ranbaxy had hired, in the hope that the former mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, could use his political heft to get the FDA to back off. The SAR was still not mentioned at the meeting, and Une was left to grapple with shadows.「I was told that Jay D-san of IP [Deshmukh] was the barrier of information,」he wrote in his journal.「I still do not know why Malav-san placed so much importance on Jay. (Jay has something on Malav?)」

Though Une was inching closer to the truth, a group of Malvinder’s top deputies and helpers still worked to keep the information from him. On March 16, 2009, Une was in New Delhi for a critical Ranbaxy board meeting. Before the meeting, Warren Hamel, an external Ranbaxy lawyer from the firm Venable LLP, emphasized to a company lawyer that the SAR had likely triggered the U.S. government’s investigation. But once Une arrived at the meeting, no one mentioned the SAR. After the meeting, Une noted in his journal that his「understanding of the background of the dealings with the FDA is still insufficient.」

As Ranbaxy’s problems with the FDA worsened, despite Malvinder’s claims that he was doing everything possible to resolve them, Daiichi Sankyo grew unsatisfied with his management. One Ranbaxy adviser urged Une to think of Malvinder「from the perspective of a parent raising a child.」At a compensation committee meeting on March 26, Une proposed to Malvinder that he forgo his bonus, owing to the deteriorating relationship with the FDA and the poor earnings result. Not only did Malvinder object. He broke down in tears. As Une noted in his journal, Malvinder「did not clarify problems of his own management, or his responsibility. In addition, he cried, exposing his vulnerability.」

By mid-April 2009, Une and his top executives had concluded that Malvinder wasn’t able to perform as a professional CEO. Une wrote in his journal:「Malav-san is getting more confrontational than defensive . . . we have no choice but to fire him.」At that point, Une blamed the problems on poor management and noted a「difference in attitude towards quality.」He pondered whether the real problem wasn’t「Malav-san’s secrecy.」

On May 8, Une finally told Malvinder that he could not continue as CEO. Within two weeks, the Indian CEO resigned. Months later, Une was still in the dark. But from his new vantage point, he had begun to see a different side of Malvinder. Une noted in his journal, in a tone as mild-mannered as ever,「Although Malav-san seemed like thinking about the company, he actually prioritized his family profits as a private shop owner after all. I was disappointed.」Even after Singh’s departure, executives remained loyal to him and continued to conceal the SAR. Lavesh Samtani, who had replaced Deshmukh as the company’s general counsel, instructed Hamel that an upcoming presentation to Une should not delve into the facts of the case and, specifically, should not mention the SAR.

On November 17, 2009, federal prosecutors invited Ranbaxy’s attorneys and outside lawyers, including Hamel, to Justice Department headquarters in D.C. It was time for the prosecutors to show their hand. They gave a hard-hitting presentation, emphasizing that the misconduct at Ranbaxy had spanned years and involved all of the company’s facilities and all of its drugs. In the sixty-seven-slide PowerPoint they displayed, the prosecutors tracked dozens of false statements. They showed that the company’s top executives had known about, and were complicit in, the fraud. The prosecutors made clear that, in their view, any unexplained misstatements in Ranbaxy’s FDA filings were likely instances of criminal conduct rather than innocent mistakes or oversights. Their evidence included excerpts from the SAR. At that, the Venable lawyers rose from their chairs. One walked closer to the slide presentation, as though to see if the image of the SAR was real.

It was a devastating meeting. But to Hamel, it had one silver lining: he could finally right the profound wrong done to Tsutomu Une. He asked Justice Department officials for permission to share their presentation with Ranbaxy’s board, which Dr. Une chaired. They agreed. Two days later, at a conference room in Venable’s New York office, Hamel showed Une the Justice Department presentation. The microbiologist was stunned. Suddenly, the bewildering problems he’d been confronting for more than a year made sense. The next day, in an email to a company consultant, Une tried to piece all the information together. He wrote that there had been a「whisperer」from inside the company, who’d taken documents that had been presented to board members and given them to the U.S. government. Brian Tempest and Malvinder Singh had tried to conceal「all the documents relating to the issues. This is the reason why the cases could be criminal,」Une wrote, and why the「FDA insists the issues could be caused by corporate culture.」

Finally, Une understood the true nature of the company that Daiichi Sankyo had bought. He felt driven by the need to make his company whole for the disastrous purchase he’d championed. Within three years, Une’s carefully written journal would become Exhibit A when Une and a team of lawyers brought their claim of Malvinder’s deception before an international court of arbitration in Singapore.

立案调查

第十三章

从阴影中现身

2006 年 10 月 11 日新泽西州普林斯顿

在一个阳光明媚、空气清新的早晨，黛比·罗伯逊带着两名同事来到一号公路旁的亚美利套房酒店，与那个自称为马尔文德·辛格、美国药监局简称为「M」的男人见面。

这时距萨库尔第一次联络美国药监局举报已经过去 14 个月了。他一直表现得很可靠，而且提供的信息很准确。他看起来没有隐瞒实情，也没有夸大情报。也看不出他有什么不可告人的动机，他似乎只是想阻止他的前雇主生产危险的劣质药物。但这时，美国药监局的调查员们正准备跨出关键的一步，罗伯逊有责任确保美国药监局和美国的检察官们不会被卷入一场公司内斗或是一个商业圈套，并且确认这个「M」和他表现出来的一样可信。

就在美国药监局调查员和检察官们准备对兰伯西的新泽西总部出具搜查令时，萨库尔成为美国药监局的耳目。罗伯逊向他提出了一个又一个问题：那里有谁？坐在什么位置？总部大楼有多少入口和出口？广域网接口在哪里？网域控制器又在哪里？公司的电子邮件服务器加没加密？普林斯顿的服务器可以在印度远程关闭吗？一旦印度办公室得到突击检查的风声，有什么办法阻止他们关闭服务器？

萨库尔小心谨慎，细致入微，帮助罗伯逊穿越了一座虚拟迷宫。他绘出一张新泽西办公室的电子分布图，详细到每一间厕所的位置。他的电子邮件里充满微小的细节。

然而在 2006 年 9 月，经过 9 个月紧张的电子邮件往来之后，罗伯逊在邮件中向他提出一个前所未有的问题：他们能见面吗？她是这样解释的：

我绝对不是要骗你，我只是认为见一面是最节约时间的，也有助于澄清一些问题。实话对你说，联邦检察官办公室全力支持这个案子，但因为案情复杂且涉及政治，负责受理此案的联邦助理检察官还很犹豫，他要我们保证能准确地理解所有情报。

她说的不全是实话。到这时，马里兰州联邦检察官办公室的检察官们还几乎不知道这个案子的存在，对它的原委肯定也不了解。分配给这个案子的检察官只有一名，他是格林贝尔特办公室的一位主管，手上的案子已经排满，再没有多余的精力了。尽管如此，罗伯逊还是有责任了解她的线人，并且一定要知道线人的动机。

萨库尔这时已经在新泽西州工作。他立刻表示，很愿意见面。但他仍有一点担忧：他回信说，自己没有代理律师，一直以「诚实的个人」的身份与罗伯逊合作，「既然这是一次较为正式的会面，我是否需要一位律师来代表我呢？我必须向你坦白，我并不富裕，在美国请代理律师价格太高，不是我负担得起的」。在这个问题上，罗伯逊也叫他放心：这次会面和他们之前的电子邮件往来没有什么不同，只是形式改成了面对面交流而已。

早上 9 点 30 分，萨库尔来到亚美利套房酒店的大堂，他穿着夹克和休闲裤，十分得体。罗伯逊也来了，黑色鬈发垂到肩膀，一双棕色的眸子透着热情，举止和蔼而干练。她的宽松上衣里面别了一把西格绍尔.357 口径的手枪。和她同来的是两个女士，一个是刑事调查办公室的另一位调查员，还有一个是合规官员凯伦·高桥，她也参加了最初的电话会议。四个人在酒店大堂落座，秋日的阳光从窗外洒入。

他们在那里坐了两个小时，其间萨库尔按时间顺序梳理了公司内部的事件，他说了自己是如何获得情报的，哪些销往美国的产品他觉得已经失效，兰伯西又是如何利用漏洞躲过美国药监局的历次视察的。罗伯逊主要负责提问。当她问到萨库尔预计他的家庭会有哪些危险时，萨库尔述说了辛格家族曾在争议中雇暴徒的情况，也介绍了举报人在印度的一般下场。

四个人都沉默了。虽然萨库尔已经竭尽所能控制情绪，但罗伯逊还是能看出他在发抖。

当三名美国药监局调查员离开时，她们称为「M」的这个男人已经正式变回迪内希·萨库尔。不过他毕竟选了一个恰当的化名。他凭直觉知道，要让兰伯西受到法律制裁，马尔文德·辛格将是最大的障碍。

2006 年 11 月 29 日，辛格率领一支由五名公司顶层高管组成的代表团来到美国药监局总部，艾卜哈·潘特就在其中，还有公司的知识产权律师杰伊·德希穆克，长期为公司担任外部律师的凯特·比尔兹利（Kate Beardsley）以及咨询公司精鼎医药派出的一名代表。这一行人的任务对于兰伯西的存亡至关重要：他们要说服美国药监局的官员们取消对帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂申请的审批冻结。会议桌上，他们面对着 10 个满腹狐疑的美国药监局监管者，埃德温·里韦拉 - 马丁内斯也在其中。官员们同意听听公司的说法。会议是兰伯西发起的，高管们都有备而来。

兰伯西的法规事务副总裁艾卜哈·潘特表情凝重，第一个开口说话：「谢谢各位给我们见面的机会。」

马尔文德·辛格平静地注视着监管者，表示兰伯西致力于品质生产。「我们对美国药监局指出的问题非常重视，马上采取了行动去解决。」他说，「我已经调动一切资源，确保我们的生产完全合规。」大家都不作声。他继续说道：「合规与否对我个人关系重大，兰伯西一向由我们家族管理，到我已经是第三代了。」他接着建议：「如果出于任何原因，各位感觉公司没有通力配合，请你们直接与我联系。」

监管者们带着怀疑的神情，听几名公司高管依次描述公司新制订的品质改良计划，比如雇外部公司精鼎医药来做审计 —— 这家公司的员工都来自美国药监局以及新成立了一个管理层审查委员会。

高管们解释说，他们已经在稳定性实验室里加派了 18 位分析师，并且清理了积压的样品。他们还宣称，公司已经不再冷藏待检测的稳定性检测样品。这时咨询顾问罗恩·特茨拉夫（Ron Tetzlaff）博士也在一旁插话，说他所在的精鼎医药公司已经对兰伯西提出了广泛的建议，兰伯西也都一一照办了。

但是说着说着，话题又转回那两台冰箱里的神秘样品。一众监管者想知道，这些样品有没有被用来生成针对美国市场的稳定性数据。兰伯西的一名高管对此予以否认。几名高管还否认了美国药监局关于 Sotret 功效不如预期的发现。他们宣称，公司已经从市场召回样品，做了检测，结果与美国药监局的发现不同。几名高管表示，这是因为美国药监局的检测方法不如兰伯西自己的精确。

一众监管者的脸上挂不住了。他们继续追问。其中一位高级官员提出，美国药监局希望能看看兰伯西的咨询公司精鼎医药的审计结果。但公司辩称这是机密，无法提供。双方在审计问题上交锋了几轮。

兰伯西的外部律师凯特·比尔兹利发话了。她问道，既然公司已经上下合力消除了美国药监局的担忧，美国药监局的官方行动指示又造成了如此严重的影响，美国药监局是否愿意取消对兰伯西帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂的申请限制？监管者们回答：不能。

34 岁的马尔文德虽然知道如何在印度解决问题，但在美国解决问题完全是另一回事。这次会谈结束时，双方的对峙局面反而更紧张了。监管者们不愿取消对帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂的申请限制，除非工厂再次通过视察。另外他们还要求查看精鼎医药的审计结果。

这个局面够糟糕了。但是在这次会议上，兰伯西的几名高管还有更坏的发现。其中一个说，他好像在一名监管者面前的一沓文件里看见了拉金·库马尔的那个演示文稿，也就是那份臭名昭著的《报告》。

就在三个月前，艾卜哈·潘特曾在公司的普林斯顿总部外面，利用抽烟休息时间向杰伊·德希穆克和公司美国分部的董事长透露了一条重要情报：一名印度裔的美国药监局调查员秘密警告她说，监管者们已经获得了一份「爆炸性文件」，其内容可能将公司摧毁。当时潘特并不知道这位调查员口中的文件是指什么，但它显然已经拖慢了美国药监局对兰伯西新药申请的审批进度。德希穆克排查了公司内部的线索，发现了这份灾难性的文件，没想到三个月后，它竟然出现在美国药监局的会议桌上。

在美国药监局总部的这次紧张会议结束的两个月之后，美国药监局再次来到帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂视察。和以前一样，这次视察也提前通知了。表面上，美国药监局的目的是监管有效成分普伐他汀钠的生产，这种成分用在普拉固的仿制药中，作用是降低胆固醇。但是在美国药监局内部，这次视察的任务清单明白无误地列出了监管者准备调查的对象：「我们仍对实验室数据的真实性十分担忧…… 我们很在意公司删除的记录以及公司和视察团队说法上的矛盾。」任务清单上还指出：「要留意，关于在帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂以外生产的有效成分，公司可能会有两套记录。」

相比于美国药监局的调查目标，更能表明态度的是他们派出的人选 —— 何塞·埃尔南德斯，这时的他已经是巴尔的摩地区办公室的首席合规官员，也是最有可能发现欺诈行为的调查员之一。当年就是他在那家蟹肉加工厂里嗅到了狗肉味，也是他在路易斯安那州的那家制药厂后面的树林里发现了冒烟的药瓶。他即将前往的这家工厂事先已经得到美国药监局要来的消息，它的存亡也取决于能否给美国药监局留下好印象。在这样一家工厂能找到什么？

埃尔南德斯于 2007 年 1 月 26 日到达帕奥恩塔萨希布。在一群干部的带领下，他对工厂做了仔细勘察。这里看起来无可挑剔。各车间人员齐备，他观察时，干部们随时能调出记录。他高度戒备，开始研读普伐他汀钠批次记录中的原始数据。他感觉有什么地方不对劲，但具体又说不上来。

在一名仓库保管员的办公桌抽屉里，他突然发现一本非官方笔记本，看上面的记号，工厂好像使用了一种有效成分，而生产这种成分的公司，兰伯西并未向美国药监局报备。这是一条诱人的线索。但是几名高管解释说，兰伯西从未使用过这批材料，所以才没有向美国药监局汇报。埃尔南德斯要求一名员工在计算机系统中检索这家未经报备的公司，他就在一旁观看，但系统中并没有它的痕迹。

埃尔南德斯只待了三天半，美国药监局只给了他这点时间。虽然他的视察很严格，也获得了一些成果，但是即便他有发现违法乱纪行为的传奇嗅觉，也没有找到任何决定性的线索。不过他知道肯定有哪里不对劲，他暗自发誓，下次视察一定要找到它。

第十四章

「不要交给美国药监局」

2007 年 2 月 14 日新泽西州普林斯顿

那天早晨，当一场夹杂着冰雹的暴风雪在普林斯顿地区肆虐，兰伯西美国总部为员工们送上了精美的情人节花束。然而到 9 点 30 分左右，一群联邦调查员蜂拥来到接待区，领头的正是黛比·罗伯逊，场面一片混乱。负责全球许可申请的副总裁文森特·法比亚诺（Vincent Fabiano）正在办公室办公，忽然一个素不相识的男子走进来吩咐他：「从你的办公桌旁走开。」

「你算老几？」法比亚诺质问道。

「我是美国药监局的刑事调查员。」男人回答。法比亚诺注意到男子后腰的手枪，照吩咐从办公桌旁走开。

在二楼，一名女员工听到身后一个低沉的声音说道：「别碰电脑，别碰手机，从你的办公桌旁走开。」她的第一个念头是楼里有炸弹威胁。她转过头，看见几名身穿防弹衣的美国药监局刑事调查员，腰里都别着手枪，他们在楼里左冲右突，身边还跟着几个新泽西当地的警察。

随着大楼被警车包围，慌乱的情绪蔓延开来。一名前员工回忆道：「大家都被吓坏，有人在哭。他们拿走了全部的电脑，有人还带着枪。」员工们躲到办公桌下面，他们不知道这是一次移民调查还是别的什么。调查员们搬出一盒盒文件，还把员工都赶进一间会议室，在里面逐一盘问。他们询问了员工的公民身份，为公司工作了多久，甚至还问了他们的身高、体重。任何人想上厕所，都要由一名联邦调查员陪同。

兰伯西的公司律师杰伊·德希穆克那天早晨正好在外面，惊慌的助理给他去了电话，求他赶紧回去。德希穆克赶到时现场乱成一团，联邦调查员正把一台台电脑拖出办公室，还在审问员工。他一头扎了进去，努力阻止调查员审问公司员工。

虽然德希穆克努力使公司恢复平静，但他自己却一点都不沉着，特别是在仔细查看过搜查令之后。联邦调查员们似乎在寻找一套完整的定罪材料。当消息从新泽西传到新德里，兰伯西发布了一则声明：「这是一次突击检查。本公司对任何过失都不知情。眼下我们正全力与官方配合。」

临近傍晚，备受创伤的员工们才在陪同下离开公司大楼，他们经过接待区成堆的枯萎花朵，那里弥漫着如殡仪馆的气氛。他们后来把这一天称作「情人节大突击」。这次突击检查的时间太长，乃至参与的调查员们都叫它「情人节大屠杀」—— 被杀的是他们当晚的情人节活动。

联邦调查员们在突击检查中带走了约 5T 的数据，据他们估计，这大概相当于国会图书馆中印刷版藏书的一半容量。然而即便在这些庞杂的记录中，仍有一份文件引人注目。那是公司自己关于 Sotret 配方问题的秘密报告，由艾卜哈·潘特归档。调查员是在潘特的办公室发现它的，封皮上用粗体写着：不要交给美国药监局。这份文件证明，在两个半月前和美国药监局开的那次会议上，公司对于 Sotret 的辩护以及公司宣称监管者得到负面结论是因为检测不当的说法，都是赤裸裸的谎言。公司早就知道自己的药物功效不足，好几年前就知道了。

突击检查发生时，萨库尔在印度，正为莫哈薇庆祝一岁生日。这本该是个家庭团聚的祥和日子，但他的心思全在这次突击检查上。前同事和他联系，把公司当时的情况告诉他。他对谁也没说过自己在这张搜查令中扮演的角色。10 天后的 2 月下旬，他听到自己最害怕的消息：马尔文德·辛格和公司董事长特金德拉·康纳召集各位顶层高管举行了一次会议，会上审查了一份可能向美国药监局提供情报导致这次突击检查的人员名单。萨库尔的名字就在上面，还有他的前上司拉金·库马尔。

要是公司想伤害他或他的家人该怎么办？要是他一个人在美国时，家里出了什么事怎么办？他向罗伯逊倾诉了自己的担忧，罗伯逊也给了他美国驻新德里大使馆的地区安全官员的直接联系方式。他装作不经意地和苏娜尔说起美国药监局正在联络兰伯西的前员工，也联络了他。如果她遇到任何麻烦，可以找美国大使馆的某某帮忙。

苏娜尔越来越感到不安了。阴霾笼罩着这个家庭：他们手头拮据，丈夫不知在操心什么，且长时间不在身边。独栋房子外面只有一个保安驻守，家里除她只有一个婴儿和一个学步的幼童。她怎么也没想到，丈夫在联邦政府对他前公司的调查中扮演了关键角色。不过，她仍然十分担心家人的安危，便把丈夫告知的信息贴在衣橱门的内侧。

在搜查令生效后的几周里，美国药监局的调查员们分头行动，寻找可能提供线索和主动承认涉事的人，与此同时，兰伯西的员工们也开始选择立场了。有些员工仍然忠于公司，并用公司出的钱雇了律师。公司给包括艾卜哈·潘特在内的几名高管升了职，甚至把他们派到印度去上班，好让美国药监局和检察官不那么容易找到他们。其他的员工则和公司切断了联系，开始与调查员配合。拉金·库马尔博士在家里收到公司律师杰伊·德希穆克的两条消息，催他立刻打电话过去。

在德希穆克眼里，库马尔是一枚随时可能引爆的炸弹。他当初离开就是为了坚持原则，也从来没有答应过会闭口不谈此事。他手上可能还有那份毁灭性的《报告》，那是公司全力摧毁而不得的东西。公司的高层领导已经看过这份报告，他们会受到直接牵连。

德希穆克后来回忆说，库马尔「基本上躲起来了。我们试图把他找出来。如果他掌握了对公司有利的事实，大家都想知道。如果他掌握了不利的事实，我想知道」。他补充说：「大部分是不利的事实。」

库马尔这时已经返回伦敦，他没有给德希穆克回电，而是雇了自己的律师。德希穆克越来越急切地想让库马尔保密，他打电话给库马尔的律师，主动提供法律援助。他还留下一条令人胆寒的口信：「让拉金和美国药监局谈话时一定要谨慎，因为在这个案子中他也脱不了干系。」

在库马尔看来，这是赤裸裸的威胁。

3 月 16 日早晨，在美国药监局搜查兰伯西的新泽西总部大概一个月之后，迪内希·萨库尔来到美国药监局的刑事调查办公室，被领进一间会议室，只见一张桌子周围坐满了人。有的是美国药监局的调查员，有的是马里兰地区联邦检察官办公室的检察官，此前他都没见过。罗伯逊也在现场，她解释说他们已掌握充足的证据，可以对公司提起诉讼了。

一名检察官对萨库尔粗鲁地说道：「你得去找个律师。」

萨库尔一下子目瞪口呆：「为什么？我已经把知道的都告诉你们了。你就是律师。保护我这样的人，不是你的工作吗？」

「不，不，不……」那名检察官开始推卸责任。

「听你的意思，是证实我的指控了吧？我已经两年没怎么工作了，你要我怎么请得起律师？」萨库尔反过来质问对方。

「这就不关我的事了。」那名检察官说，「现在是正式调查，政府律师不能代表你出庭。」

罗伯逊见萨库尔表情痛苦，问他是否要上厕所 —— 这让她有机会在大堂里和他私下交谈。罗伯逊给了他一个叫「纳税人反诈骗教育基金会」（Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund，缩写 TAFEF）的组织的联系方式，说这个组织会保护潜在的举报人，让他赶紧打电话求助。她说他们可以为他找一个律师。

在开车返回新泽西州贝尔米德临时寓所的路上，萨库尔感觉人生坠入最低谷。现在的他，距离自己的孩子 7000 英里，在一间毫无生气的出租房里吃着麦片和沙拉度日，赚的钱只够勉强维持生活。但他却要去找律师，以求在自己发起的诉讼中得到保护。那一整晚，他都在想罗伯逊给的那张字条。他觉得自己一旦拨出这个号码，就会离自己熟悉并期盼的生活更加遥远。然而他已经来到一片陌生的土地，而且日复一日，越陷越深。

萨库尔思考着罗伯逊给的电话号码睡着了，第二天醒来时，第一个念头也是这个号码。那天早晨他拨通了号码，并留了一条口信。下午，他接到了纳税人反诈骗教育基金会的回电，他们给了他一个律师的名字和电话。

安德鲁·贝亚托（Andrew Beato）今年 37 岁，在华盛顿哥伦比亚特区著名的斯坦因 / 米歇尔 / 缪斯 / 西波隆律师事务所（以下简称斯坦因 / 米歇尔事务所）工作，正为自己的前途打拼。这位年轻的律师长着稀薄的棕色头发，戴着一副钢丝边框眼镜，说话时音量极低，来访者要向前探着身子才能听清他在说什么。他常常不动声色，但这掩盖不了他紧张的神情。当他露出难得的微笑时，脸上会出现浅浅的酒窝。他已经为各种举报人代理了大约五年，这一天纳税人反诈骗教育基金会告知他，可能会有客户联系他。

他的事务所向来有为举报人打官司的传统。2002 年，事务所代理了辛西娅·库珀（Cynthia Cooper），她曾是世通公司的内部审计员，揭露了公司近 40 亿美元的假账。创建事务所的合伙人之一雅各·斯坦因（Jacob Stein）还在克林顿弹劾听证会中代理过莫妮卡·莱温斯基（Monica Lewinsky）。但这时的贝亚托还在成长中，他的判断也还需要资深律师复核。

那是一个周五，时间已经很晚了，贝亚托正整理东西准备离开办公室。他和妻子的约会要迟到了（像往常一样）。妻子从前也是律师，现在辞职在家带孩子。贝亚托刚刚穿上外套正要走出大门时，手机响了。他心想肯定是妻子打来问他到哪里了。电话转入语音信箱。来电的不是妻子，而是一个语调柔和礼貌的男声，他说话带印度口音，措辞很正式 —— 是那个举报人。

贝亚托给他回了电话，说自己正要下班，并要他把情况「非常简短」地概述一遍。萨库尔一时不知从哪里开始，于是信口说了起来。贝亚托一边听着，一边试着从零碎的片段中理出头绪，渐渐地，他觉得这个男人准是疯了。

萨库尔讲述的事听起来令人难以置信，简直就不可能：他说印度最大的制药公司的顶层高管蓄意在全世界布下了骗局。服用该公司药物的包括美国的消费者。照这个男人的说法，这场骗局不局限于一家工厂或者一种药物，而是牵涉许多家工厂和数十种在全球发行的药物。这场骗局涵盖的范围如此之广，让这个指证它的男人听起来仿佛精神错乱了。贝亚托心想，他肯定不太了解这个行业的运作，甚至不知道药是怎么做出来的。商业骗局往往只发生在有限的范围内，有特定的原因：一名行事恶劣的员工，一起单独的事件或者一家管理混乱的工厂。现在他却说一家公司的一切都是骗局，这有可能吗？

那个男人说公司的几百名员工都参与了这场骗局，仿佛诈骗就是他们平常的业务，这根本说不通。不可能有这样的事。如果真是这样，又怎么会这么长时间都没人发现呢？听着萨库尔在电话里滔滔不绝，贝亚托越来越担心和妻子见面迟到，对这个举报人也越来越怀疑了。

「我得挂了。」贝亚托尽量用温和的语气说道，「你还是给我发电子邮件吧？把细节都写在里面。」

在之后不到 24 小时的时间里，贝亚托和这个迪内希·萨库尔交换了五六封电子邮件，他最初的看法逆转了。虽然他还远远不清楚兰伯西发生了什么，但他已经开始相信萨库尔那个疯狂故事或许有真实的成分了。

从许多方面来看，贝亚托都是最能理解兰伯西案的律师。长期以来，医疗卫生都是他家族的事业，疾病则是他家族的命运。贝亚托生长于密苏里州的圣路易斯市，是七个孩子当中最小的一个。他才两岁时母亲就因乳腺癌去世。父亲是一位敬业的内科医生，他会深夜到病人家出诊，这在同行中非常少见。由于他一心为患者福利着想，营收很低；在那个流行管理式医疗的时代，他也拒绝限定病人的就诊时间。

他的几个哥哥姐姐进入医疗行业，贝亚托却选择了法律，他从法学院毕业后立即加入斯坦因 / 米歇尔事务所。一开始，他代表许多公司和联邦贸易委员会打官司。但他对这样的工作缺乏兴趣。他不想每天早上起来就想着怎么帮一家公司逃脱罪责。然而，身处一家公司制律师事务所的他，该怎么帮助个人而不仅仅是公司，同时继续偿还助学贷款呢？正当贝亚托内心还在为这个问题挣扎时，他父亲因为一种罕见的脑部肿瘤去世了。虽然父亲没有给家人留下任何积蓄，但是贝亚托回忆道，他留下了一笔「品格的财富」。数百名心存感激的病人来为他守灵，这证明父亲致力于帮助他人的一生是有意义的。

贝亚托也渴望像这样服务人民，这将他引向一个刚刚发展起来的法律领域：为举报人代理。这项业务可以追溯到美国内战，属于《虚假申报法》中一个名为「qui tam」的部分，那是一个拉丁文名称的简写，全称可以翻译为「为国王并为自己提起诉讼者」。根据这部法律，举报人可以起诉那些欺骗政府的人或机构，并领取一部分追回的公款。它最初的目的是杜绝奸商向联邦军队出售残次装备。到 20 世纪 40 年代，根据一条修正案，举报人可以领取的奖赏金额被减少了，之后这部法律被废弃不用。然而到 1987 年，在媒体报道了国防承包商的广泛欺诈之后（比如五角大楼花 640 美元买下一个马桶圈的著名事件），这部法律被再次修订，又增加了对举报人的奖赏，这使得人们有了举报诈骗的动力，也使律师有了代理这类案件的兴趣。

贝亚托的第一个举报人案件涉及一个心脏科医生开展没有必要的手术，官司虽然输了，但他认识到纠正对人民和政府犯下的错误是一种道德追求。

在初次对话的几周之后，萨库尔来到事务所的会议桌前，对面是贝亚托和他的几位同事，其中包括一位高级合伙人。虽然衣着光鲜，侃侃而谈，但萨库尔看起来疲惫而焦虑，他的眼圈发黑，肩膀也耷拉着。他开始用平静的声音详细描述兰伯西用谎言织就的复杂网络以及他本人为撕破这张网络所做的努力。

会面刚到 10 分钟，萨库尔就心力交瘁，啜泣起来。「我到底做了什么？」他一遍遍地问道，「我到底做了什么？我只想做正确的事而已。」他说他愚蠢地将家人拖入险境，现在已经无法回头了。这时美国药监局已经开始向兰伯西的干部发出传票，萨库尔很害怕公司将采取的应对手段。他解释说，这种事在印度有很不一样的收场方式。想到萨库尔和他的家人面临的人身危险，几个律师意识到他们要应付的是一个在美国绝对不会出现的局面。

况且萨库尔的案子还极其复杂。律师们必须考虑这场骗局波及的范围。这算得上虚假申报吗？兰伯西有哪些违规行为？这些行为对药物成分有实质性的改变吗？他们该怎么证明这些？还有这个正在会议室中啜泣的男人，他们怎么做才能给他最好的保护？这个案子还会给事务所带来重大的财务风险：他们可能花费大量金钱，最后却输掉官司，一无所获。但是在和萨库尔会面两天之后，几位律师已经基本笃定：虽然可能产生可怕的后果，事务所还是会为他代理。贝亚托回忆说：「这是一起公共卫生事件，事务所的任何人都不会退缩。」

趁着一个沉默的间隙，萨库尔问贝亚托：「我该怎么支付费用？用什么来支付？你们肯定不会免费接这个案子吧。」贝亚托的回答如同天启：萨库尔无须支付任何费用。事务所将冒着风险为萨库尔免费代理，并以萨库尔的证据为主要指引，协助政府对兰伯西提起公诉。接着，事务所还会根据调查结果对公司提起一桩秘密诉讼，全程不对外公开。在政府调查期间，萨库尔的身份将始终保密。如果达成和解，政府获得的赔偿中将有三分之一归萨库尔所有，届时贝亚托再从中抽取部分佣金。根据这个安排，萨库尔将成为一名受到法律保护的举报人。而在这之前，他还根本不知道自己能够获得这样的保护。

第十五章

「问题有多严重？」

2007 年马里兰州罗克维尔市

针对兰伯西的监管案在美国药监局的各部门间缓慢推进，最终来到了道格拉斯·A. 坎贝尔（Douglas A.Campbell）的办公桌上。37 岁的他供职于美国药监局的国际合规团队。他的有些上司对这个案子没什么兴趣。「我们认为没什么好查的。」其中一名上司这样劝他。从表面上看，这起案子是针对一家生产工厂的一场漫长斗争。兰伯西的律师们坚持要美国药监局解除对帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂提交申请的暂时禁令，声称公司已经把需要改正的地方都改正了。监管者们则要求兰伯西交出其咨询公司精鼎医药的全本审计报告。像这样的僵局在美国药监局的办公室里只是家常便饭。

但是坎贝尔阅读案件资料时，却来了兴趣。这家公司在回应美国药监局的视察结果时，把大部分问题都归咎于抄写错误、数据丢失或内部系统的错配。然而在精鼎医药的审计摘要（兰伯西的律师拒绝公布全本）中，咨询顾问们又指出一些稳定性检测数据「前后矛盾」。公司目前提交的是改正后的数据。但是改正前后的出入似乎太大了，不像是单纯的错误，比如开展某次检测的时间，改正前后竟有 45 天的出入。这家公司的管理就这么混乱或者这么马虎？

即便药物上市很久之后，制药公司仍须按预定的时间间隔检测自家的药物。每一年，公司都要将检测结果编入年度报告上交给美国药监局。这些报告没几个人会读，收到后就被堆在闲置的办公室里。尽管如此，报告中的信息仍然必须是真实的。

2007 年 7 月 3 日，坎贝尔驱车前往局里的仿制药办公室总部，在那里翻出了兰伯西为三种抗感染药物 —— 氟康唑（fluconazole）、环丙沙星和依非韦仑（efavirenz）提交的年度报告。从报告上看，公司似乎是按照恰当的时间间隔检测药物的。然而坎贝尔将这些数据和他办公桌上改正过的数据一对比，便被两者的差异震惊了。氟康唑的年报里说，兰伯西在 2004 年 9 月 26 日开展了为期三个月的稳定性检测。但是在回复美国药监局的警告函时，公司表示这次检测是在 2005 年 8 月 17 日开展的。两个日期之间，有接近一年的出入。

在坎贝尔看来，要么是兰伯西的生产过程已经失控，要么是公司撒了谎自己忘了。「一旦比对过日期，真相就呼之欲出了。」他回忆道。

他的这个发现非常重要，至少对他自己而言。要求对药物做如此频繁的检测，是为了保证能迅速检测出不安全的产品，不让它们在市场上停留太长时间。然而坎贝尔的一众上司似乎对不一致的日期态度冷淡。其中有些人接受了公司的说法，即问题主要是因为「抄写错误」，或单纯是因为未更新数据。但坎贝尔不信这套说辞。他回忆说，这可不单单是「把 0.54 写成了 0.45 那种错误」。兰伯西的数据错得如此离谱，使他「甚至找不到一处有意义的数据」。既然连数据都没有意义，那就无法证明兰伯西的药物是安全有效的了。

道格·坎贝尔的上司是埃德温·里韦拉 - 马丁内斯，也就是第一个与萨库尔通邮件的美国药监局官员。他站在坎贝尔的这一边，并没有因为兰伯西改正错误的说法而感到放心。他在 2007 年 3 月致信同事说，他相信美国药监局应该继续暂停对帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂新药申请的审批，直到兰伯西「彻底解决美国药监局警告函中的所有问题」。坎贝尔和同事继续审查兰伯西提交的文件，发现每抽出一条线索，每追查一串检测数据，似乎都会牵出更大的隐情，那是监管者不曾料到的新发现。

2007 年 10 月，公司报告说它生产的加巴喷丁 —— 一种治疗癫痫发作的敏感药物，出现了一种名为「化合物 A」的杂质突然增多的情况。根据良好生产规范，数据中出现反常的高峰和低谷都属于检验结果偏差。按照要求，公司应该在发现这一现象后的三天内向美国药监局报告，但是这一次，公司却拖了四个月。监管者很快发现，公司的问题不仅仅是晚报了加巴喷丁杂质猛增的情况。过去六年，它始终没有向美国药监局的新泽西地区办公室汇报反常的检测结果。而对于任何一家生产大量产品的警觉的药企，这样的汇报都应该是常态。

公司将这个令人担忧的过失归咎于公司内部一连串小问题。但是当美国药监局的调查员们来到兰伯西的新泽西总部时，他们在这个本该出具报告的地方有了更大的发现：对于 600 毫克剂量的加巴喷丁药片，其三个月、六个月和九个月的稳定性检测都是公司在四天时间内赶出来的；对于 800 毫克剂量的药片，则是在同一天检测的。他们之后篡改了检测日期并且存档，从而制造出检测是以恰当的间隔进行的假象。

在美国药监局内部，这条消息成为兰伯西涉嫌欺诈的铁证。坎贝尔在给里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的电子邮件中写道：「正中靶心！！！」里韦拉 - 马丁内斯立即将这一发现上报：「我们挖到金矿了！」并罗列了虚假检测的细节。美国药监局药物评估和研究中心合规办公室的主任德博拉·奥托（Deborah Autor）只回复了一个字：「哇。」

忽然之间，兰伯西的那些所谓的过失、反常和遗漏就有了完全不同的面貌。坎贝尔在政府配发的笔记本上潦草地写道：问题有多严重？他们是怎么通过合规检测的？下面一行是：他们可以老实交代或继续说谎。他们还会继续耍我们吗？

最后一行是：他们还值得信任吗？

坎贝尔肌肉结实，以前是一名橄榄球运动员，他在陆军待了八年，其中三年是现役。1998 年，他开始为美国药监局工作，是在弗吉尼亚州的罗阿诺克市的一个常驻职位，视察的对象包括婴儿奶粉配方和一家罗非鱼养殖场。2006 年，坎贝尔被调到国际合规部，这是一个深藏在药物评估和研究中心之内的部门。他的团队每年开展约 100 次海外视察。他本人就曾去尼加拉瓜视察奶酪，去希腊视察过葡萄叶卷。

后来，几乎在一夜之间，美国药监局就迎来了一波全球化的浪潮。需要坎贝尔所在部门视察的项目数量激增。他回忆说，来自国外的申请「全都堆积在我们的办公室」。2002 年至 2009 年，需要美国药监局视察的海外工厂的数量从原来的 500 家左右猛增到了 3000 多家。正如坎贝尔在一篇综述中所说：「和我们有关的职责如爆炸般增长。我们的负担无比沉重，资源却没有真正分配到位。」

随着视察需求的增长，美国药监局也手忙脚乱地开始制定新规以跟上形势。一次，坎贝尔致信一名同事询问局里的出差规定：「我们要在季风季节派团队去印度吗？如果连阴凉处温度都在 43℃以上，我们还要派团队去吗？」同事回复：「过去，我们一般会把出差任务推迟到季风季节之后，但现在由于工作量的增长，我们已经不再遵守这条规定了。」

在一家海外工厂获准生产药物之前，坎贝尔的部门应该开展一次预审视察，以确认这家工厂能够安全有效地生产药物。但是光记住这些工厂的情况，及其相应的代码，都是一项极繁重的任务。那些工厂真的在生产那种药物吗？生产那种药物的工厂，真的是被视察的那几家吗？坎贝尔明白，他和同事们责任重大。当他在审读兰伯西的文件时，这份责任也沉甸甸地压在他的肩上：「我们应该让这些药物进入美国吗？还是要将它们拒之门外？」

这年 10 月，也就是何塞·埃尔南德斯视察帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂时，没有发现证据只能疑惑地离开的九个月之后，他收到一封非同寻常的电子邮件。对方是兰伯西的一名员工，化名「桑尼」（Sunny），他说自己 1 月在工厂见过埃尔南德斯，过了这些时间，终于有勇气写下这封电子邮件。桑尼说，埃尔南德斯上当了，和之前去视察的许多美国药监局调查员一样。「我的良心不允许我保持沉默，因为这关系到人民的健康。到现在为止，兰伯西已经掩盖了许多事实。」桑尼继续写道：「您在这些地点看到的并非真相。要发现真相至少需要一个月的时间。」他描述了公司的顶层高管如何持续向基层员工施压，迫使他们给关键的药物放行，包括异维甲酸（isotretinoin）、加巴喷丁、氟康唑和二甲双胍。这些药物「都有缺陷，但工厂的品质保障部门都让它们通过了」。他说了几个策划阴谋的高管的名字：「多年以来，他们一直在愚弄、欺骗美国药监局。」

桑尼还表示，在埃尔南德斯到达帕奥恩塔萨希布之前，公司已经派出一支 20 人的研发团队到工厂来检查并更改数据。「这次粉饰行为就发生在美国药监局视察之前。」他写道：「兰伯西的所有工厂常常都会这样操作。」他说，公司高管在最高领导层的授意下策划了这些骗局，并胁迫基层员工执行他们的命令。为了证明公司已经给稳定性检测实验室增加人手的说法，在埃尔南德斯视察期间，高管们从工厂各处抽调了人手到那间实验室充数。

当举报人的揭发在美国药监局官员之间流传，这些监管者被兰伯西的表里不一震惊了，部分是因为他们很难弄清公司的骗局到底牵涉多广。美国药监局面对的是一整个体系，其中的数据被狡猾地篡改，使一切显得无懈可击。到这时，虽然已经搜查出一些证据，他们仍以为诈骗只是零散的个人行为。但如果整个公司的经营手法都是一场骗局呢？如果所有员工都已参与其中，他们又该怎样揭穿这个由谎言组成的阴谋？

当美国药监局再次进入兰伯西的工厂，调查员们忽然在各个地方都发现了他们之前忽视的线索：原来工厂使用了未经批准的原料，还暗中篡改了配方，使用了未报备的有效成分，还抄袭了别人公开的数据。他们甚至照抄了品牌药的色谱图，即测量药品杂质的图表，然后谎称是公司自己的。兰伯西现在就像一艘漏水的沉船，已经有至少六位举报人致信美国药监局，各自列举了关于欺诈和不当行为的例子。

桑尼继续发来邮件。埃尔南德斯很快帮他联系上黛比·罗伯逊，她当时领导着美国药监局刑事调查办公室的调查。桑尼向罗伯逊透露，兰伯西在 Sotret 出现问题后无法用正当手段解决，只能趁药品还在市场上销售时偷偷修改配方，在蜡基中加入油以改善药物的溶解情况。这些情况完全没有向美国药监局报告，因而构成了严重违规。在没有美国药监局许可的情况下，药企是被严令禁止对已经获批的配方做任何修改的。

另一名举报人也反映了 Sotret 的问题，并敦促美国药监局核查这种药物在 2006 年 12 月前后的配方变化，因为公司正是那时修改配方的。举报人在邮件中向美国药监局药物评估和研究中心的监察专员表示：「早在 2005 年和 2006 年年初，就有几位科学家想解决这个问题，但公司商务部的员工冷酷地拒绝了他们。他们对诚实的人毫不欣赏。我不知道这对美国用户构成了多大的危害，但是作为生产团队的一员，也作为一名善良的世界公民，我认为必须提请你们注意此事。」

看来，几乎没有什么事是公司做不出来、说不出来的，没有任何借口是他们不敢编造的，他们的声明要多牵强有多牵强，只要能骗到美国药监局批准他们的药物就行。公司不会按要求调查自己的检测结果偏差，只会声称自己的实验室对样本处理不当，从而产生了不利结果。有时，相比于生产药物，兰伯西倒像更擅长制造借口。正如一位美国药监局监管者敦促她的同事时所说的那样，对于兰伯西的「出入、矛盾、错误、疏忽以及不力调查」，都不能只看表面。公司说起谎来是如此明目张胆，以至于黛比·罗伯逊说她从来没遇到过这样的事：「我调查毒贩多年，从来没见过有人这样公然藐视法律。他们敢在你面前撒谎。有人告诉我这是文化特色。他们知道自己在说谎，但也知道能逃过惩罚。」

要纠正这种全球性的违法行为，唯一的手段似乎就是全球性的惩罚。美国药监局有一种很少使用的手段，那也是它能做出的最重惩罚：申请诚信政策。自 1991 年制定这条政策以来，美国药监局只针对四家药企施行过。根据申请诚信政策，美国药监局可以停止审批一家公司的所有申请，直到外部审计员（由公司出资聘请）确认其数据合法合规。这项制裁一出，监管者和被监管者之间的形势就会逆转。美国药监局再要禁止兰伯西的产品，就不必费力证明它欺诈了。相反，为了使自家产品获批，兰伯西倒必须证明其产品不存在欺诈。

美国药监局只有在发现犯罪行为或「关于重要事实的不实声明」时，才会实施申请诚信政策，而兰伯西案显然符合这个标准，至少道格·坎贝尔是这么认为的。他已起草一份备忘录，列出了监管者已经记录的各种谎言。他建议药物评估和研究中心对「所有与兰伯西实验室有限公司相关的申请，无论是已经获批还是尚在审核的」，都施以申请诚信政策处罚。换言之，就是对整个公司进行严厉制裁。

然而，随着草案的流传，一个个会议接踵而至，坎贝尔开始对自己的沟通能力产生怀疑。似乎没有哪条信息符合成为证据的要求。谁也不确定申请诚信政策是否应该实施，甚至是否合理。美国药监局的办公室里挤满了律师，他们关心的似乎不是保护公众的健康，而是如何避开公司在法庭上的诘难。美国药监局的律师们为其要求争辩起来：哪里有规定说企业不能把药物存放在没有报备的冰箱里？企业宣称原始数据已经丢失，有任何书面条文规定他们一定要永久保存数据吗？

连美国药监局对自身的定位也似乎模糊起来。其工作是帮助兰伯西遵守规范呢，还是在公司不合规的时候让它关门？震惊于美国药监局内部的迟疑，坎贝尔在笔记本中写道：「我们的目标绝不是放过兰伯西！」但实际上，美国药监局又似乎对兰伯西很宽容。国会和公众都迫切地希望找到更多便宜的药物。在政府的总统防艾计划中，兰伯西也扮演着向非洲提供抗艾滋病药物的关键角色。这家公司是不是已经变得太大或太重要，以至于不能让它倒台了？

美国药监局对自身执法任务的困惑并非唯一的问题。坎贝尔后来总结说：「还有别的势力在阻挠我们办案。」这些势力是金钱、人脉，还是政坛的影响？他感到越来越疑惑，尤其是在美国药监局的一些印度裔员工登门拜访之后 —— 那些人以前从不来他的办公室，现在却找到种种借口来套近乎。

还有德博拉·奥托这个人。身为领导药物评估和研究中心合规办公室的律师，她在美国药监局的职位比坎贝尔高了好几级，管理着大约 4000 名员工。在 1995 年加入联邦政府之前，她曾在一家律师事务所工作三年，她的老东家后来发展成了布克和比尔兹利事务所，也是目前代理兰伯西的律所。因此，她和兰伯西的外聘律师凯特·比尔兹利也很熟。

比尔兹利将奥托当成熟悉案情进展的直接通道，她通过打电话或发电子邮件了解政府的工作进度，而且千方百计地促成对她的客户有利的决策。奥托也应比尔兹利的请求敦促政府推进工作，她把这看作美国药监局的本分：向与本机构尚有未竟事宜的公司所雇的律师做出回应。在美国药监局的合规办公室开始办理兰伯西案之前，奥托离开那家律师事务所已经 13 年了，但在坎贝尔看来，比起推进美国药监局对兰伯西的调查，有时候奥托似乎更愿意帮助她的前东家。比尔兹利在 2007 年 3 月致信奥托说：「德博拉，我给你留了言，但想想还是再给你写封电子邮件比较好。你能否来个电话，我们谈谈兰伯西的事？我们仍在努力解决民事方面的问题，他们也在努力对付刑事方面的问题。」

奥托回复：「嘿，凯特。我很高兴打电话给你。但我对你担心的事已有充分了解，不如我这边先跟进，有消息了再打给你，好吗？」

到了 12 月，比尔兹利再次发电子邮件联系奥托，她解释了兰伯西未能完整披露精鼎医药审计结果的原因，并要奥托打电话给她。两小时后，奥托通过电子邮件告诉同事：「兰伯西需要考虑提供审计结果对刑事案件的影响。请考虑能否向兰伯西提供道格 2012 年 6 月 7 日的问题列表，以便让他们更好地了解哪些良好生产规范问题仍在困扰我们。」鉴于人脉的重叠和拖延的官僚作风，坎贝尔已经很难分清谁在为美国药监局效力、谁又在阻碍它了。随着案情变得越来越棘手，坎贝尔不愿再向奥托透露信息了。

不过，即使美国药监局的监管者不再拖延，他们仍要面对一个显然没有解决方案的问题：对于几座远在 7000 多英里之外的工厂，要如何验证公司确实如其宣称的那样已经改正了呢？

在一封写给罗伯逊的电子邮件中，举报人桑尼描述了兰伯西如何利用工厂中的隐蔽区域储存并掩盖检测仪器，这些仪器都没有和公司的主机网络连接。他指的是高效液相色谱（HPLC）仪，那是任何优秀的检测实验室中都有的重要设备。这种庞大的仪器就像一摞堆在一起的电脑打印机。将药物样品与溶液混合，注入机器，并压入一个装满颗粒物质的圆筒，仪器就会分离并检测药物的各种成分，包括其中的杂质。在名为「色谱图」的图表上，它会将这些成分显示为一系列色谱峰。

在一间合规的实验室里，高效液相色谱仪应该接入主机的网络系统，使其数据全部显示并保存。但桑尼写道，在最近的一次视察中，公司将几台未获授权的高效液相色谱仪放在两间辅助实验室里：「兰伯西辟出这样小小的隐蔽区域，在里面完成这样的操作。」

桑尼估计，美国市场上有大约 30 种产品不合规范，他向罗伯逊建议，美国药监局应对帕奥恩塔萨希布和德瓦斯工厂做突击检查以寻找证据，就像他们在新泽西做的那样。他警告说：「兰伯西内部已经开始私下交流问题产品的细节，不再通过电子邮件或者信函了。」

但因为美国的联邦检察官在印度没有司法权，使美国药监局无法在那里展开搜查。罗伯逊觉得很受挫：「别人都说‘你得去印度查查'。」而她只能回答：「我在印度能做什么呢？敲开别人的门让他们和我谈谈？我在印度没有执法权，只能倚仗一套自觉、诚信的体系。」这个案子就像一个大铁球重重地砸向了原本就不堪重负的美国药监局，它揭示了一个事实：美国药监局无法有效地管辖国外制药公司。

2007 年 11 月，就在美国药监局准备视察兰伯西设在德瓦斯的一家无菌注射剂工厂，以考虑是否批准其药物进入美国市场时，桑尼在电子邮件中给罗伯逊发来他到那时为止最重要的线索。美国药监局的规章要求这家工厂达到最高的无菌级别。但是桑尼提醒罗伯逊：「厂里的微生物数据不是真实的，它们被篡改了，显示的细菌数比实际的少。」他补充说，这家工厂还有几次杀菌失误没有上报。他的建议是「在批准这家工厂前一定要谨慎」。

在美国药监局开展视察的一个月之前，桑尼再次致信罗伯逊，提醒她德瓦斯工厂正在掩盖证据：他们正将「所有关于环境监测和杀菌失误的真实数据」从工厂转移到位于 15 英里之外劳克海利的一座仓库里。桑尼表示，工厂内的人员「将会竭尽所能迷惑审计员，他们受的就是这样的训练。质保人员已经接到命令，对那些失误要绝口不提」。

国际合规团队的成员们知道，要想拿到证明微生物检测结果已被篡改的证据，他们就必须直接去劳克海利的仓库进行突击视察。里韦拉 - 马丁内斯向上面提交了行动申请。但上面给他的答复不是他想要的。在一封标注「机密」的简短的电子邮件中，时任现场调查部副部长的帕特里夏·阿尔科克（Patricia Alcock）写道：「请查收语音邮件，对仓库视察不予考虑。」

阿尔科克在语音邮件中解释，眼下美国药监局的上级机关卫生与公众服务部（Department of Health and Human Services，缩写 HHS）正努力和印度卫生部门建立外交联系，在这个时候上门突击视察会破坏这一努力。双方正在协商拟出一份书面合作声明，若能签署，或许未来就能提高美国药监局监管下的印度产品的品质了。即便是为了达成声明草案，卫生与公众服务部的官员们也不愿意激怒印方。

这让里韦拉 - 马丁内斯很愤慨。他给阿尔科克回了一封电子邮件，并抄送给同事，质疑了她的说法。他强调了桑尼举报的问题的严重性：「如果举报属实，那么在对于合规的态度、品质管理系统以及生产控制状态方面，兰伯西都有严重的问题。」他还提醒阿尔科克：就在一个月前，在向艾奥瓦州共和党参议员查尔斯·格拉斯利（CharlesGrassley）汇报加强国外视察的举措时，美国药监局刚刚承诺会不通知就上门视察。在给国会的简报中，美国药监局官员也声明了法律没有预先通知国外工厂的要求。

里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的办公室认为，对那座仓库突击视察的做法是「合理且必要的」。加上桑尼在另一封电子邮件中提到的公司实时篡改数据的情报，里韦拉 - 马丁内斯这样向上级写道：「附上举报人的另一封电子邮件，供各位参考，邮件中指出兰伯西左右我方视察及调查员的强大能力。很显然，我方应考虑用新颖大胆的视察 / 调查策略及技巧对付兰伯西，以便更好地发现他们伪造 / 篡改数据的证据…… 以上就是我坚持不予通知就视察其仓库的理由。」

里韦拉 - 马丁内斯的坚持合情合理。但这一次回复他的是监管事务办公室负责合规政策的副理事，此人同样否决了视察仓库的提议。这名副理事解释了美国药监局高层官员的想法：「我们都认为，对国外机构突击视察的行动需要各方谨慎思考及规划，以确保调查人员的安全，并将发生不利国际事件的可能性减到最小。鉴于视察团队出发时尚无此类规划，我们认为此行不应安排突击视察。」也就是说，因为担心国际冲突会破坏外交努力，对于可能威胁美国公众健康的国外工厂，美国药监局不会开展彻底全面的调查。患者的需求是最后被考虑的。

于是，调查员们到了德瓦斯才向厂家提出参观劳克海利的那家仓库的要求。次日，他们被带到那里，花了八个小时翻查一个个抽屉和纸箱。阿尔科克告诉里韦拉 - 马丁内斯，他们「没有找到任何有关的或者举报人描述的东西」。但后来举报人桑尼告诉罗伯逊：「就在视察前不久，已经有内部人士提醒劳克海利仓库将不明材料转移了。」

不过，对这个本该无菌的场所来说，还有一个更令人吃惊的问题是公司无法隐瞒的。就像阿尔科克向她的同事传达的那样：「这座仓库…… 被几个养猪场围绕。调查员还发现，仓库内缺乏指导工作人员进入无菌区域前洗手 / 洗脚的规章和流程（许多工人穿着凉鞋…… 在工厂中 / 附近还有许多头猪）。」

美国药监局最终没有批准这处无菌工厂。虽然监管者们仍在批准兰伯西的其他申请，但这种宽容的态度已经越来越难以维持了。到 2007 年年底，德博拉·奥托得知有另一个联邦部门 —— 美国国际开发署正考虑不再让兰伯西向非洲提供低成本药物。奥托非但没有为这个强势的举措叫好，反而担心这种对公司的明确斥责会使美国药监局的监管者们难堪。她提醒上级，这会「令外界质疑为什么美国药监局还没有关闭兰伯西」。她建议通过会面或电话来讨论这个问题。其中一个被抄送邮件的人告诫同事：「这些情报不要告诉别人。」

2007 年 12 月 12 日，国际开发署给兰伯西发了一封措辞严厉的信函。信中谴责公司没有及时向美国药监局汇报负面的检测结果。信中说：「一家公司履行美国政府资助的分包合同，却如此公然违背商业诚信与诚实原则，这一点让我非常担忧。」信末的署名人是采购及援助办公室的代理主任，他表示国际开发署正在考虑让兰伯西暂停参加这一项目或禁止其参加。相比之下，美国药监局似乎对沿用旧做法没有那么不放心。「那些监管者很乐意将事情一再拖延下去。」坎贝尔回忆道。

2008 年年初，兰伯西申请在喜马偕尔邦新建一家名叫巴塔曼迪的工厂。它提出要在那里生产敏感药物，包括一种用于防止器官移植病人产生排异的免疫抑制剂他克莫司（tacrolimus）。这次申请立刻引起了坎贝尔和同事的怀疑。巴塔曼迪工厂离帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂很近，完全可能是后者的一部分。兰伯西是否要将帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂的一部分分离出去另建新厂，以此逃避美国药监局对那里的禁令？

按照惯例，美国药监局下令对巴塔曼迪工厂能否生产他克莫司开展预审视察。但是这次任务绝对不同往常。上面抽调了何塞·埃尔南德斯前往。3 月初，他来到巴塔曼迪，带上了他所谓的「开阔思维」以及不再被愚弄的决心。像往常一样，埃尔南德斯从外面开始，仔细查看场地。站在这座新工厂的外围，他可以看见大约 2.5 英里之外的帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂。他还注意到了一圈 8 英尺高的围栏，几乎将巴塔曼迪工厂完全围在里面。工厂只有一个入口，由足够的岗哨把守。这些守卫都曾担任军警，他们自豪地确认自己将所有进出大门的员工和访客都登记下来了。谁也不能从他们身边溜过去。

这正好符合埃尔南德斯的需求。通过查看大门口的岗哨记录，他得知在生产他克莫司的关键批次的那段时间，那几个自称在现场监督的主管其实并不在工厂。他们没有在大门口的安保日志上登记。批次记录上的日期、时间和签名全是伪造的，都是事后填写的。一天晚上在酒店里，趁着兰伯西派来陪他视察的高管们也住在那里，埃尔南德斯把其中一个堵到角落里说：「当天主教徒做了坏事时，他们会到神父那里忏悔。借这个机会，你就把我当作神父，告诉我是谁参与捏造了这些欺诈数据。」

对方并没有当场承认。不过到视察结束时，在工厂的收工会议上，几个经理基本上承认了公司想尽快让巴塔曼迪工厂开工，以规避美国药监局对帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂的限令。

埃尔南德斯告诉兰伯西的几名高管，他打算建议上级不要批准这家新厂。兰伯西负责全球生产的高级副总裁也在现场陪同视察，他把埃尔南德斯拉到一边。埃尔南德斯在记录中写道，这位副总裁变得「焦躁而急切」。他承认新厂的建设太赶进度，犯了一些错误。他还一遍遍地保证，只要是埃尔南德斯指出的地方，他们都可以改正，但是请他不要在报告中使用「伪造」两字。

美国药监局拒绝将巴塔曼迪认证为一家独立的工厂，兰伯西也撤回了生产他克莫司的申请。在一场全球性的打地鼠游戏中，这是新的一轮。每次美国药监局在兰伯西内部发现欺诈行为，它都会小范围实施监管限令，而欺诈行为又会在别的地方再冒出来。美国药监局还没有下手禁止兰伯西的整个业务。但是这场游戏就要发生变化了。

第十六章

钻石和红宝石

2007 年 10 月印度新德里

马尔文德·辛格的 2007 年开局不顺。和他那位富有远见、创建体制并留下精神遗产的父亲不同，马尔文德认为自己的主要任务是为股东创造价值。正如他对印度的商务媒体所说：「我骨子里是一个企业家，而创造价值是任何一个忠诚企业家的最终目标。」

然而持续创造价值并没有表面看起来的那么简单。2006 年接管公司后，这位年轻的 CEO 迅速按他在 MBA 项目中学到的策略行动起来 —— 他要积极寻求并购和结盟。他虽然成功地引起了热议，但按照《亚洲货币》（AsiaMoney

）杂志的说法，兰伯西的净利润却在「下滑」。兰伯西不得不放弃收购德国最大的仿制药公司。还有就是美国药监局。在他看来，这些美国监管者真是一群讨厌鬼，他们对他的改革承诺无动于衷，也不理会公司挽回脸面的姿态。

在马尔文德的祖国印度，几乎任何问题都可以被打发掉，要么通过策略性地出一笔钱，要么就动用武力威胁。五个月前，马尔文德的弟弟施文德刚刚阻挠了一位著名的心脏外科医生回到辛格家族的一家新德里医院工作，因为那位医生反对他的一场交易。那位医生去上班时，遇到了近 100 名警察和整整一个营的快速反应部队，他们配备了催泪弹和一部水罐车，都是用来镇压暴乱的。

但是在美国，他召集不到治安部队，美国药监局也拒绝让步。作为兰伯西最大的股东，辛格兄弟发现这些问题已经开始影响公司的净利润了。正当马尔文德忧虑时，公司在纽约的一名顾问发来一条有趣的消息，极大地吸引了他的注意。有一个名叫采孟（Tsutomu Une）的人，他来自日本药企第一三共，想和兰伯西洽谈一项战略合作。马尔文德感觉机会来了。

在距新德里 4000 英里的东京，采孟博士正在全世界寻找新的收入来源。第一三共是日本的第二大制药企业，而采孟是负责全球企业战略的高级执行官，他希望能打入遥远的市场，去那些公司从未涉足过的地方，比如印度和东欧。为此，他需要一家能大量生产低成本药物的合作商。他不断将目光投向兰伯西。

时年 60 岁的采孟是一位微生物学家，通过医学创新一路升迁。他先在第一制药公司干了 30 多年，并于 2005 年公司与三共公司合并后继续高升。采孟为人谦和庄重，对自己的职业生涯做了细致的记录。

在世界各国中，日本是一个特别热爱品牌的社会，对仿制品极不信任。整个国家都很注重品质和卫生。日本的制药业曾因品质低劣遭人耻笑，但今天它已经成为品质管理的领先者，享誉全球。在日本，就连药片都得做成白色，不然患者就会觉得可疑。虽然采孟正是在这股严谨的社会氛围中成长起来的，但他注意到日本制药业的孤立本质，也明白对高成本研究的专注拖慢了企业的成长。

从这个角度来看，兰伯西这家在 11 个国家设有工厂、在 125 个国家销售产品的公司，是一个诱人的选择。它在美国有大量首先提交的药物申请等待审批，其中包括立普妥的仿制版，一旦投产，那将是史上最赚钱的仿制药。第一三共希望拥有一批低成本药品，以便在重磅新药投入市场之前创造稳定的现金流。要达到这个目的，兰伯西或许是一位理想的盟友。如果能快速完成收购，就能在下个季度的股东会议之前，撑起第一三共疲软的股价了。

在日本公司的董事会上，决策往往需要一致意见的驱动，因此采孟需要说服所有同事。不过就像第一三共的董事长庄田隆（Takashi Shoda）对同事所说的那样：「印度将成为日本药企走向世界的一张王牌。」这个想法正在酝酿之中。

采孟对文化影响感受十分敏锐，他知道这件事会很微妙。兰伯西不是印度的一家普通公司，而是一座文化机构。它为著名的辛格家族所建立，已经连续传承了三代。目前掌控它的仍是辛格家族的一名子弟，他在美国接受过 MBA 教育，年龄几乎只有他自己的一半。然而采孟也非等闲之辈，他在第一三共内部有着崇高的声望，他的见识受人尊敬，其商业头脑也有目共睹。于是 2007 年 10 月初，他跨出第一步，在纽约联系了兰伯西的一名外部顾问。

首次交谈之后不到三周，采孟和马尔文德见面了。采孟的一头银发向后整齐地梳着，说着一口口音浓重的英语。马尔文德讲起话来措辞讲究，穿着定制套装，优雅的头巾配一条相称的手帕，流露出镇定自若的风度。两人的协商进展迅速，当即定下在新德里继续会谈的安排。采孟和马尔文德的会谈都是秘密进行的，在内部报告和通信中，都用「钻石」指代第一三共，用「红宝石」指代兰伯西。他们还一同为将来的会谈编了一个幌子：如果有媒体问起，就说双方在讨论一项委托制造协议。这种协议在商界比比皆是，不会吸引商业媒体追究。

采孟与马尔文德初次接触后，经过四个多月，他们的对话已经远远超出战略合作的范畴，上升到了关于买断的谈判。日本微生物学家和年轻的印度亿万富翁在股价和条款上讨价还价。不过采孟对笼罩在兰伯西头顶的那朵监管阴云仍感担忧。在往来的电子邮件中，受到律师指点的采孟不断向兰伯西施压，要求它把通常会有的保证、陈述和赔偿条款讲清楚，这样如果兰伯西的财务状况不像马尔文德许诺的那样健康，第一三共就可以起诉它违约了。但马尔文德始终对他的要求不给予正面回应。最后，采孟在一个电话里告诉他：「您始终用‘不必担心'回答我方的提问，我的同事们都对此感到沮丧。」在当天的第二个电话中，马尔文德用他动听而平稳的声音安慰这位科学家：「红宝石没有什么恐惧的，也没有犯错误。」

但是采孟的疑问并未消除。众所周知，联邦调查员 2 月突击检查了兰伯西的美国总部，并向它在帕奥恩塔萨希布和德瓦斯的两家主要工厂发出了警告函。但谁也不知道这次调查结果究竟有多严重，公司的潜在病灶又有多深。马尔文德曾在电话里问采孟：「您到底在担心什么呢？」

对于强大的美国司法部的检察官和世界上最严的美国药监局监管者到底在查什么，采孟只能猜测。确认细节则是他的顾问的工作。不出一个月，马尔文德和采孟在德里秘密会面，这一次两人带上了各自的律师和一小撮顶层高管。采孟声明，美国对兰伯西的各种调查的结果，将会决定第一三共是否继续谈判。马尔文德听了不动声色，并许诺会提供协助并在谈判中保持坦诚。他同意召开一次尽责调查会议，会上将向第一三共披露所有和调查相关的文件。

年轻的 CEO 对采孟表现出一副开诚布公的样子，向他解释了这些调查的真正幕后推手：辉瑞制药在报复兰伯西，他们因为输了立普妥专利诉讼，所以耍手段让美国药监局派出调查人员。采孟思索着这个说法，此时一众高级顾问，包括兰伯西的知识产权律师杰伊·德希穆克却板着脸，一言不发。

虽然马尔文德愉快地保证了兰伯西「没有什么恐惧的，也没有犯错误」，但这家公司根本上仍是一个火药桶。马尔文德很清楚，公司的阴暗秘密已经被记录在公司内部称为《报告》的重磅文件中，也就是拉金德尔·库马尔向董事会展示的那个爆炸性的演示文稿。

如果当初销毁这份文件，马尔文德就不会落到今天这样尴尬的境地了。但他相信文件已经到美国政府手里了，并且会被检察官与监管者盯上。兰伯西的几个外部律师已经向他挑明，如果公司不纠正《报告》中描述的错误，美国政府的麻烦是逃不掉的。虽然《报告》没有提及供应到美国的药物所使用的数据是否真实，但美国政府的检察官们自然会认为，公司的这么多药都是骗人的，那绝不能信任其中的任何一种。

马尔文德与美国药监局的那场灾难性的会面几周之后，多年来帮助兰伯西与美国药监局周旋的律师凯特·比尔兹利登上一架飞往新德里的飞机。她是专门去和马尔文德讨论《报告》的。她告诉他，除非公司处理了《报告》中的问题，否则美国药监局会继续来找麻烦。前面的路只有一条：将所有被标记为「虚假数据」的药物和申请撤回，然后重新检测、重新申请，这也是库马尔在两年前那次倒霉的董事会议上提出的建议。比尔兹利告诉马尔文德，眼下局面很糟，需要在全球展开补救。

如果说公司本来对政府是否掌握了《报告》还留有一丝怀疑，那么 2007 年 2 月在新泽西的那次搜查已经彻底解开了他们的疑虑。兰伯西的律师获悉，美国药监局调查员从艾卜哈·潘特的办公室拖来的文件中就有《报告》。一个月后，在伦敦希思罗机场附近的一场会议中，比尔兹利再次提起这份文件，这一次的对象是德希穆克和公司的前 CEO 布赖恩·坦皮斯特，后者仍在担任公司顾问。与会的还有一位新来的外部律师克里斯托弗·米德（Christopher Mead），他是伦敦和米德事务所的合伙人，公司请他来是为了对付美国司法部日益频繁的调查。米德做过检察官，经验丰富，他一下子就明白了《报告》的意义。他知道，很可能就是这份由公司高管制作的承认诈骗的文件引发美国司法部开展调查的，它未来还可能使公司的各位高管受到起诉。这引起了众高管极大的恐慌，乃至在一通电话中，德希穆克警告坦皮斯特不要去美国，因为在那里他可能被捕。

2007 年 6 月，米德坐在马尔文德对面，告诉他自己收到了美国司法部的两封信函，要求他提供和《报告》有关的文件。米德的语气十分强烈。他说，《报告》的内容极其严重，反映了极其浓厚的腐败文化，公司必须正面回应它所引发的担忧。如果不这么做，美国政府不可能就此放手。

但这时兰伯西与第一三共离达成协议越来越近，说起《报告》，马尔文德担心的是另一件事：《报告》招来了监管者和检察官，这几乎肯定会引起日本人的反感，并危害到公司与第一三共的协议。他得想个办法让那些文件凭空消失。他让几个信得过的副手编造了 2004 年那场董事会议的纪要，其中并没有提及库马尔的《报告》。

马尔文德还对采孟软磨硬泡，使他不再坚持合同担保的事。他争辩说印度的合同与别处不同，由此使采孟接受了单一的陈述和保证，相信投资兰伯西如马尔文德描述的那样安全。这个担保将来自兰伯西公司，而不是马尔文德本人。不过采孟的顾问也警告他说，如果不对兰伯西被美国政府调查一事做尽责调查，就不要收购这家公司。他打算听从这个建议。

总的来说，采孟的策略就像第一三共的一名律师当时对一名顾问总结的那样：「如果我们在即将到来的谈判中展示最大的努力、诚意和理性，那么对方也会向我们展示他们的努力、诚意和理性。」那名顾问回复说：「我们对红宝石太过信任了，他们完全利用了我们的轻信。」杰伊·德希穆克后来指出，两国的文化就像「油和水」。他说，印度人靠「勇往直前」在商场上取胜，「伦理是次要的」。和他们相比，日本人就显得「太过轻信，像婴儿走进了森林」。

在兰伯西内部，马尔文德让德希穆克领导尽责调查事宜。当他们在筹备和第一三共的一次重要会议时，马尔文德对他下达了明确指示：不要提到《报告》及任何相关的事情。德希穆克有些犹豫，但最终还是表明他会遵从命令。他还建议几个外部律师，在任何情况下都不要对第一三共提《报告》的事。兰伯西的其他高管也得到指示，不要和第一三共的高管交谈，要沟通只能通过马尔文德的行政助理。后来，马尔文德却否认自己对第一三共歪曲或隐瞒了信息，并表示兰伯西的所有信息都是公开的。

虽然艾卜哈·潘特原本计划在即将召开的会议上谈论美国药监局的警告函，但马尔文德的私人律师建议她不要提及《报告》。这样的信息封锁能够成功，部分是因为马尔文德在自己周围安插了一群心腹，他们和他的家族及那个密切参与他家族事务的灵修组织都有联系。马尔文德最初和采孟打的那几个电话，他们几乎都旁听了。

2008 年 5 月 26 日，在双方顶层高管和律师的陪同下，马尔文德、德希穆克和采孟在新德里会面。为确保德希穆克信守承诺，公司给了他一份马尔文德签发的脚本，要他全程参照行事。其中没有提到《报告》或者政府调查和它的关系。这份脚本把德希穆克蒙在鼓里。他只能告诉第一三共，美国药监局和司法部的调查只是例行公事，针对的也是其他不相干的事情，并且兰伯西面临的指控不可能造成重大损失。

根据约定，兰伯西开了一间数据室，供第一三共的律师们审阅文件，其中就包括和美国检察官的往来信函。但是，提到《报告》的文件都已经从这一沓沓材料中被移除。美国司法部的两封询问《报告》相关文件的信件也被移除了。

几周后，在马尔文德参加的一次伦敦高管会议上，德希穆克得知日本人将成为兰伯西的大股东，当下如被雷击。直到那时，他都以为两家公司谈的是一份委托制造协议，而非买断协议。原来他一直被蒙在鼓里。德希穆克得知这是收购谈判后，马上意识到隐瞒信息不仅不正当，而且还是欺诈行为。

散会后，德希穆克找到凯特·比尔兹利，向她咨询自己故意向第一三共隐瞒信息要担什么责任。他心乱如麻，对比尔兹利说他正在经历一场「良心的危机」。比尔兹利说她不能亲自向德希穆克提供咨询，因为她是兰伯西的律师。不过她也觉得马尔文德下令隐瞒《报告》的事情太过严重，于是咨询了自己的合伙人能否继续为兰伯西代理。他们的结论是：如果第一三共联系他们询问政府调查的事，他们绝不能撒谎，只能辞职。

但第一三共始终没有联系他们。不出几周时间，这家日本公司就签署了协议，成为兰伯西的大股东，马尔文德将留任 CEO，任期五年。在 2008 年 6 月的一次新闻发布会上，马尔文德宣布了这个消息，震惊了印度商界：他和弟弟施文德已经同意将二人手上 34% 的兰伯西股份出售给日本人，要价是惊人的 20 亿美元。之后日方还将继续购入股份，达到比 50% 略多的控股比例。

马尔文德称这次出售股份是一个「令人伤感的决定」，但这也会增加两家公司的价值，并使兰伯西偿清债务。谈起他已不再是股东一事，他说：「公司的愿景、梦想和志向照旧，一样都不会改变。」他面对的是激烈的批评，外界批评他把兰伯西卖给日本人，背叛了印度企业家的尊严。「兰伯西是战无不胜的印度英雄，它应该站立到最后一刻，而不是第一个屈服。」兰伯西的一名前任高管这样对《经济时报》说。

但马尔文德屈服的时间恰到好处。

仅仅过了一个月，2008 年 7 月 3 日，马里兰州联邦检察官办公室就向州地方法院提交了一份爆炸性动议，使美国药监局的官员和兰伯西的高管都大吃一惊。这份公开的动议要求法庭强制兰伯西交出精鼎医药的审计报告，而法庭在七个月前已经就此事开出传票。从一个方面看，这项动议只是例行公事。但其所用的语言却犹如一记重拳。动议中描述了「该公司系统性的欺诈行为」，并指出公司仍在违反法规，「始终以欺诈或误导为目的，在国与国的商贸中引入掺假和冒牌产品」。

在美国药监局内部，原本沮丧的官员们一片欢腾。尽管他们自己的单位还没有采取行动，但检察官们已经先出手了。埃德温·里韦拉 - 马丁内斯在电子邮件中对他的团队成员说：「我已经很久没有收到这么好的消息了！我们等待了这么久，在这个案子上投入了这么多时间和精力…… 现在终于能看到成果了。」这位向来低调的官员最后写道：「请大家享受剩余的周末时光吧，如果你们还能保持冷静的话。」

这项动议引发了公共卫生专家、国会调查员和国外监管者暴风般的质询，他们立刻开始重新评估各自对兰伯西的调查。就连兰伯西自家的顾问也迷糊了：既然美国药监局对弥漫于一家公司上下的腐败风气已如此了然于心，那为什么还要批准这家公司的一个个产品以及一家家生产工厂呢？

药物评估和研究中心合规办公室主任德博拉·奥托转发了一篇博客文章，作者是一位曾在美国药监局工作 38 年的老员工，文章标题是《美国药监局是时候封杀所有兰伯西产品了》。文中写道：「我觉得，除非兰伯西能向美国药监局证明这些记录上的问题不是公司的一种风气，否则美国药监局应该直接通知兰伯西：他们获准进入美国的所有产品，无论实际上是在哪家工厂生产的，都将不准再进入。」这也是美国药监局的合规官员道格·坎贝尔一直以来的提议。文章最后写道：「从此，美国药监局会将美国消费者视为值得保护的‘顾客'，而不是一味地继续只保护商家。」奥托在电子邮件中附上了一句简短的话，并设成了粗体：「如要继续讨论，应见面详谈，不能发送电子邮件。」

最终引发美国药监局行动的，既不是公共卫生的风险，也不是公司的持续阻挠。在检察官们提交动议的两周之后，一封标题为「提防 ××」的电子邮件被发送到几个美国药监局高级官员的邮箱。发件人是首席律师办公室的一位律师，邮件写道：「我刚刚得知，国会可能很快会大力调查，既然兰伯西在印度生产的药物被指控是在欺诈条件下生产的，为什么美国药监局没有积极阻拦这些药物的进口？」

美国药监局可能会受到国会的质询，这在其内部拉响了警报。当道格·坎贝尔的手机响起时，他正在波兰视察一家制药厂。来电的是德博拉·奥托。之前她从来没有直接联系过他。现在她一心想保护美国药监局，因此想知道：「我们会对兰伯西采取什么行动？」坎贝尔对她说了实话：「我们没有行动。」但三天后，坎贝尔在一名官员发来的电子邮件中接到了新的进军令：「准备行动。现在你的首要目标是兰伯西了。」

似乎是为了应对国会的质询，一份关于美国药监局在兰伯西问题上采取了哪些措施的内部小结在高级官员中流传开来。它淡化了帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂的发现，表示那并不足以构成限制该工厂的产品进入美国的理由。小结表示美国药监局拒绝过兰伯西的一些申请，但没有提到自 2005 年萨库尔首次举报诈骗之后，它又批准了 27 项申请。小结还表示五次视察「并未发现证据能支持举报人关于生物等效性检测的说法」，这么说最少也是在掩盖真相。

。

小结最后说道，下一步如何行动很难判断。它在药物评估和研究中心内部也引发了科学上的争议。这像是在说美国药监局一直在积极处理案件，好为行动做准备，而不是在消极地拖延时间。而实际上，面对被国会监督的可能，美国药监局也确实准备行动了，只是一如既往地行动迟缓。

第十七章

「你怎么就不明白」

2008 年 7 月印度新德里

就在马里兰州联邦检察官办公室提交动议、指控兰伯西「系统性的欺诈行为」时，马尔文德也遭遇了职业生涯中最严重的危机。兰伯西的诚信面临质疑，公司股价下跌。与第一三共的交易尚未完成，马尔文德就得想办法挽救这次合作。

在与记者的一次谨慎的电话交谈中，他公开指控有人在搞阴谋，就像他之前告诉采孟的那样。「有人想混淆视听，他们显然是想把我们的股价做低，好低价将我们买进。」他这样对投资者说，「一家跨国公司正伙同一家印度巨头做低我们的股价。」他虽然这样宣称，但并没有提供任何证据。马尔文德表示，第一三共「在开展尽责调查的时候就知道这些事情了。我们的合约不会改变，其中也没有退出条款」。

在兰伯西内部，高管们正聚集在一起商讨对策。他们在马尔文德的办公室参加了一次会议，他们的日程上都将它标记为「非常重要」。会上的第一个议程：「自我评估」。除了那份《报告》，几乎任何事情都可以蒙混过去，但是只要《报告》一出，马尔文德的种种说辞就都会成为谎言。

危机感一天天地增长，公司请来帮助管理危机的外部律师事务所方阵也在扩大。2008 年 7 月底，公司律师杰伊·德希穆克和外部律师克里斯托弗·米德一起出差到兰伯西总部开会，与会者包括马尔文德及其他公司高管，还有另两名外部律师：长期担任公司美国药监局律师的比尔兹利，以及来自维纳布尔事务所的雷蒙·谢泼德（RaymondShepherd）。谢泼德被请来应对一个新问题：美国国会的审查。他们必须制定一条策略，以应对一波接一波的问题。在前往会场的汽车上，德希穆克向米德坦白了一件事：因为马尔文德的阻挠，第一三共对《报告》并不知情。米德听了暴怒。

会上，《报告》再次成为对话的焦点。米德满怀怒火地意识到，公司对《报告》中指出的问题毫无作为。他从潘特起草的一份报告中得知，公司仍在出口 60 多种根据虚假数据被批准的产品。他沮丧极了，一拳砸在会议桌上，冲马尔文德咆哮：「你怎么就不明白呢！」他坚持要兰伯西立即停止出口这些产品，比尔兹利也附议。米德表示，在公司完全解决《报告》中的问题之前，美国政府是不会罢休的。马尔文德表面上默许，同意从全球市场召回问题产品。另外，米德和德希穆克都催促他向第一三共坦白《报告》的事情。马尔文德只回答：「日本人那边我会应付的。」

在兰伯西的高管中间，这次会议后来被称作「你怎么就不明白会议」。会后，马尔文德确实采取了明确的行动：他解雇了米德的事务所，换了一家来应付美国司法部。

正当兰伯西的高管和自家的律师争执不下时，美国药监局的官员们准备行动了。2008 年 9 月 16 日，在检察官们提交动议的两个月之后，美国药监局宣布将停止从兰伯西的两家工厂 —— 德瓦斯和帕奥恩塔萨希布进口 30 多种药物。它还公开了写给两家工厂的警告函。药物评估和研究中心主任珍妮特·伍德科克（Janet Woodcock）博士在一次新闻发布会上表示：「我们想通过这次行动发出一个明确的信号：供美国消费者使用的药物必须符合我们的安全性及品质标准。」

就在合规部门员工暂停工作为此庆祝时，美国药监局的官员们又召开了一场媒体吹风会，表明他们会对兰伯西采取强硬立场。他们要禁止从兰伯西的两家工厂进口药物。不过他们并没有要求兰伯西从美国的药房召回这些药物。德博拉·奥托将这次针对兰伯西的行动描述成「前瞻性的」，她告诉记者：「美国药监局没有理由认为这两家工厂生产的已进入美国的药物会造成安全问题。」她声明美国药监局的检测显示这些药物是合乎规范的，并补充说：「美国药监局并没有证据表明兰伯西的这些产品是有问题的，只是所发现的生产过程和质量控制的问题可能影响产品，因此才采取了这些前瞻性的措施。」

奥托是代表美国药监局说这番话的。正如她后来所说的那样，她的声明「只是重申了美国药监局的官方立场，和往常一样，那也是组织上下的许多人在经过漫长的内部审议之后的结果」。不过她的声明仍在组织内部激起了愤怒。负责刑事调查与合规审查的员工开会讨论了声明的准确性和影响。美国药监局已经知道兰伯西的两种药物 ——Sotret 和加巴喷丁，没有通过品质检测，并可能对患者造成危险。如果这两种药物没有缺陷，那它们的问题又是什么呢？美国药监局又有哪些制裁手段？坎贝尔也觉得茫然。「她的声明里显然有一个指导思想，就是避免制造恐慌。这就是律师的想法。」他说，「律师的良心和我们普通人是不一样的。」

这番声明为兰伯西送去一条救生艇，也使美国药监局调查员的工作艰难了许多。未来几年，兰伯西将会引用这番声明来抵挡美国药监局的调查。但是在短期内，美国药监局宣布的进口禁令和警告函毕竟引发了公司内部的一场危机，并且蔓延到了三个大洲。

在美国药监局发出强硬声明的一天之后，马尔文德·辛格依然在一场电话会议中向采孟坚称公司没有做错任何事，他告诉采孟，事情的发展令他「感到震惊」。他宣称公司向来全力配合，之前也「没有迹象或预兆」表明美国药监局对公司的努力不满。

神奇的是，尽管有种种警示信号，两家公司的交易仍照常进行。兰伯西同意向美国司法部提交其咨询公司精鼎医药制作的审计报告的完整版，美国政府也撤回了其执行传票的动议。采孟依然对马尔文德表现出信任，他在日记中写道：「马尔文德先生在每一件事上都真诚回应了我们的要求，并做了相应的准备。事情的进展开始顺利了。」他甚至提醒自己要注意文化差异，不要怀有负面的想法。他在一篇日记中写道：「马尔文德先生对我们和美国药监局有关的要求回应缓慢。我知道现在正是印度最大的节庆…… 得耐心啊！」

2008 年 11 月 7 日，第一三共和兰伯西完成交易。一个月后，这家日本公司以多数股份控制了兰伯西的董事会。只一眨眼的工夫，马尔文德和他弟弟的个人资产就增加了 20 亿美元，马尔文德也成为日本人的员工。这是一个奇怪的安排，充满风险。不过兰伯西的律师杰伊·德希穆克却从中看到了新希望：既然兰伯西已经同意与美国司法部合作，并交出精鼎医药的审计报告，那么或许公司很快就会与美国的检察官们达成协议，使隐瞒《报告》的事变得无关紧要。那样，他也就不必因为对采孟说谎而内疚了。这一切都会过去。同时，德希穆克也感觉自己来到了一个奇异的新世界。和日本人交流时不必大呼小叫，没有强制性决议，他发现日本人一定要取得共识才会行动。常常是 10 个人开电话会议，结果却没有办成什么。

虽然兰伯西突然遇到了困难，采孟仍然很高兴。交易是他促成的，他也对此进行了详细记录。「辛格先生适应得很好。」他在日记中写道。但是当他为了兰伯西的每月例会而做研究时，他也发现关于如何解决公司与美国药监局矛盾的讨论「还只触及了皮毛」。2009 年 2 月 19 日，采孟到新德里和马尔文德会面。他要去厘清一系列事务，包括如何平衡马尔文德的自主权和第一三共的管理以及弄清兰伯西与美国药监局矛盾的始末。有什么地方不大对劲，但他也说不上来。

2 月 25 日，他在返回东京之后得到一条消息，遭到了重重的一击。美国药监局宣布将对兰伯西实施最严厉的处罚：申请诚信政策。申请诚信政策是药物监管者给药企打上的耻辱烙印。只有当美国药监局认为一家企业的申请充满欺诈或极不可靠时，才会实施这项政策。之后再要获得批准，企业就必须证明自家的产品没有欺诈。申请诚信政策覆盖了兰伯西在帕奥恩塔萨希布为美国市场生产的所有产品。这一行动使人充分认识到了问题的深度和广度。股市随之做出反应。兰伯西的股价掉了 18%，连带第一三共的股价也跌了 9%。「一场危机！」采孟在日记中写道。但即便到了这个时候，充满绅士气度的他依然没有猜忌他最著名的员工，换成其他高管早就那样做了。他反而写道：「这虽然是马尔文德先生的管理问题，但现在应该先鼓励他，批评就留到以后吧。」兰伯西和第一三共都召集了危机应对小组。不出三天，采孟就乘飞机前往新德里。在那里，他不断试着理解为什么美国药监局要对公司下此重手。

因为马尔文德继续装聋作哑，采孟只能猜谜了：如果像马尔文德宣称的那样，兰伯西做的每一件事都是对的，那为什么美国药监局会认为整个公司都不诚信？采孟能做的只有分析眼前的一条条线索。他是一位细心的观察者，在日记中记录了和马尔文德及其副手的每次会议：「我发现他们也不明白美国药监局实施申请诚信政策的原因。他们没有意识到，美国药监局怀疑的是公司的整个体系，虽然它已经部分修复了。马尔文德先生是最后才来参加会议的。这时与会者的语气变了。他们很怕他。」

在兰伯西内部，申请诚信政策使紧张的氛围沸腾了。杰伊·德希穆克已经无计可施。他也在上级的直接命令之下参与了骗局。第一三共要负责处理美国药监局和司法部提出的问题，便完全有权知道这些问题的由来。时间一天天过去，对于《报告》的持续隐瞒和针对采孟的骗局也越来越站不住脚了。虽然德希穆克名义上负责清理欺诈性申请文件的痕迹，但是在每一个节点，他都受到了公司内马尔文德拥护者的阻挠。在会议上，德希穆克开始公然表达他的沮丧，有几次甚至威胁要把《报告》告诉第一三共，其他人也有此意，只是不愿大声说出来。

德希穆克和马尔文德的分歧日益严重，终于在 2009 年 3 月初公开爆发了。「我们认为你的行事方法不对。」在印度举行的一次运营会议上，德希穆克对马尔文德说道，当时有十几个人在场。

「你不能这么说。」马尔文德打断了他，「‘我们'是谁？‘你'又是谁？」

「‘我们'是律师。」德希穆克说。

「杰伊，我对你很不满。」马尔文德答道，「你现在分出‘我们'和‘你'、‘我们'和‘他们'来了？你不是我们的一分子了？」

「随便你怎么理解。」德希穆克反驳道，「我就是想解决问题，你却在捣乱。我和合规律师坚持的事，你的人就是不愿意做。」

这次冲突后不久，马尔文德给德希穆克打了电话，后者当时已经返回美国，马尔文德告诉他：「我要你待在印度。」他命令德希穆克乘下一班飞机回去。不到 72 个小时之后，马尔文德就瞪着办公桌对面的德希穆克，并给了他三个选择：一是自愿离开，双方洽谈补偿条件；二是调到印度工作，只处理知识产权业务，别无其他；三是被公司开除，按最差的条件得到补偿。德希穆克要求给他一天时间考虑。

当天夜里，德希穆克和几个他信任的同事出去喝酒诉苦。他抱怨公司的堕落全是因为马尔文德，说他害了公司的 12 000 名员工和他们的家属。「地球上有一种人恶劣至极，这样的人数量不多，而这个男人就是其中之一。」他说。他还威胁要把《报告》的事告诉第一三共。

苦闷之中，他说了太多。第二天，马尔文德把德希穆克拉进他的办公室。他的身边坐着人力资源部部长。两人很快撕破了脸皮。「我听到你说了什么。」马尔文德说，意思是这位律师昨晚喝酒时说的话已经传到他耳朵里。马尔文德接着要人力资源部部长离开。他告诉德希穆克，如果他把《报告》透露给第一三共，自己就会亲自对付他。「我知道你住在哪里。」他说。

德希穆克不愿屈服。「你当然知道我住在哪里，你这个白痴，你去过我家。」他接着说道，「你干吗不把那个搞人事的叫进来，让他也听听你的威胁？」他还表示，如果马尔文德试图在美国伤害他，「你会吃不了兜着走」。他又补充道：「我可以肯定地说，我在湿婆神军党（Shiv Sena）的熟人是不会罢休的。」德希穆克的一个远方表亲是湿婆神军党的创立者之一，那是一个可怕的右翼印度教民族主义政党，常涉足政治暴力。

「你玩弄女人。」马尔文德反击道，「你的事情我都有记录。」

两人继续互相谩骂。「要是你父亲还活着，他一定会感到羞耻。」德希穆克说道。

这是这位律师在兰伯西的最后一天。这天，马尔文德强迫他辞职。他后来在反思兰伯西的行为时说：「说老实话，他们都伪造大量数据点了，成百上千个…… 还有什么是他们干不出来的？」在一众外部律师的反对声中，对采孟的欺骗仍在继续。要是这位微生物学家知道《报告》的存在，他立即就能破解公司遭遇灾祸的真相。但因为缺乏这条关键情报，他只能继续筛查线索。

大约就在德希穆克离开公司的时候，采孟飞到纽约去和朱利亚尼合伙人公司开会，那是兰伯西雇的另一家外部咨询公司。采孟希望，鲁道夫·朱利亚尼（Rudolph Giuliani）这位纽约前市长，能运用他的政治影响力让美国药监局罢手。在这场会议上《报告》仍未被提及，采孟只能继续与影子搏斗。「有人告诉我，杰伊·D. 先生（指德希穆克）是阻挡我获得情报的人物。」他在日记中写道，「我仍不知道为什么马尔文德先生如此重视杰伊。（杰伊抓到了他的把柄？）」

虽然采孟正在慢慢接近真相，但马尔文德的一干高级副手和帮手仍在极力隐瞒情报。2009 年 3 月 16 日，采孟在新德里参加一次关键的兰伯西股东会议。会前，兰伯西的外部律师、维纳布尔事务所的沃伦·哈梅尔（Warren Hamel）向公司的一名律师强调，可能就是《报告》引发了美国政府的调查。可是当采孟到达会场，就没有一个人再提《报告》。散会后，采孟在日记中写道，他「对美国药监局行动的背景仍未充分了解」。

兰伯西与美国药监局的冲突愈演愈烈，虽然马尔文德宣称自己正尽全力解决冲突，但第一三共对他的管理越来越不满意了。兰伯西的一名顾问敦促采孟「从父亲抚养孩子」的角度看待马尔文德。在 3 月 26 日一次补偿委员会的会议上，采孟建议马尔文德放弃奖金，因为公司与美国药监局的关系越来越差，营收也很糟糕。马尔文德不但提出了异议，还掉了眼泪。采孟在日记中写道，马尔文德「没有澄清他在管理上的失误，或他的责任。并且他暴露了脆弱的一面，哭了出来」。

2009 年 4 月中旬，采孟和他的高管们已经认定马尔文德无法胜任职业 CEO 的角色。采孟在日记中写道：「马尔文德先生的态度已经不是自卫，而是对抗了…… 我们别无他法，只能解雇他了。」到这时，采孟仍将公司的处境归咎于管理不善，他还注意到「双方对于品质的不同态度」。他也考虑过症结是不是「马尔文德先生太神秘兮兮了」。

5 月 8 日，采孟终于告诉马尔文德他不能继续担任 CEO 了。在不到两周的时间内，这个印度 CEO 就辞职了。几个月后，采孟仍然被蒙在鼓里。但是他从一个全新的视角，开始看到马尔文德的另一面。采孟在日记中以向来平和的口吻写道：「马尔文德先生表面上是在为公司考虑，实际上却像一名私人店主，他优先考虑的是家族的利益。我对此很失望。」即便在马尔文德离职后，公司的高管们仍效忠于他，并继续隐瞒《报告》一事。比如接替德希穆克出任公司总法律顾问的拉维什·萨姆塔尼（Lavesh Samtani），就吩咐哈梅尔在即将对采孟所做的报告中不要深谈案件中的事实，尤其不能提到《报告》。

2009 年 11 月 17 日，一众联邦检察官邀请兰伯西的内部和外部律师前往美国司法部在华盛顿的总部，哈梅尔也在受邀之列。到检察官摊牌的时候了。他们做了一场坚决有力的报告，强调兰伯西的不当行为已经持续多年，并牵涉公司的所有生产场地和药物。在他们展示的 67 张幻灯片中，检察官们揭穿了几十条虚假陈述。它们显示公司的顶层高管都是骗局的知情人、共谋人。检察官明确表示，他们认为，兰伯西向美国药监局提交的申请中那些无法解释的错误陈述，都可能是犯罪行为，而非单纯的错误或者失察。他们的证据就包括那份《报告》的摘要。看到这里，维纳布尔事务所的几名律师都从椅子上站了起来。其中一个走到幻灯片前，仿佛是想看看《报告》的图像是不是真实的。

这是一次具有毁灭性的会议。但是对哈梅尔来说，也有一点好处：他终于可以纠正公司对采孟所犯的深刻错误了。他问司法部的官员，能否将这次报告的内容在兰伯西的董事会上分享，好让采孟博士也看看。他们同意了。两天后，在维纳布尔纽约办公室的一间会议室里，哈梅尔向采孟展示了司法部的报告。这位微生物学家目瞪口呆。顿时，困扰他一年多的谜题都能说通了。第二天，在一封写给公司顾问的电子邮件里，采孟试着将所有信息都串联起来。他写道，公司内部有一名「告密者」，此人把向董事们展示的文件交给了美国政府。布赖恩·坦皮斯特和马尔文德·辛格曾经极力隐瞒「一切与此事有关的文件。这也是此事可能构成犯罪的原因」。采孟写道，这也是为什么「美国药监局会坚持认为这可能是公司文化造成的」。

终于，采孟明白了第一三共究竟收购了一家怎样的公司。他觉得必须在自己推动的这次灾难性收购中保全公司。不到三年之后，采孟将和一队律师在新加坡的国际仲裁法庭上对马尔文德提起欺诈指控，到那时，他那本详细记载的日记将成为证物甲。
