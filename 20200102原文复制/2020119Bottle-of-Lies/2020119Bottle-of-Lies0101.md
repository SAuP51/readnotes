# Part I Shifting Ground

## 0101. The Man Who Saw Further

LATE FALL 2001

Hopewell, New Jersey

Dinesh S. Thakur was fastidious. He wore perfectly ironed khakis, a white button-down shirt, a dark sports jacket, and well-polished loafers. Stocky and of medium height, he had a round face, full head of dark hair, and deep-set eyes that gave him a doleful appearance. On this chilly afternoon, the leaves just beginning to turn gold and crimson, the thirty-three-year-old information scientist set out across the grassy slope toward the man-made lake. It was a favorite destination on the Bristol-Myers Squibb campus, where employees went to clear their heads or escape the highly regimented corporate culture, if only for their lunch hour.

But today Thakur had come at the behest of an older and more senior colleague, who’d invited him for a walk to discuss an unspecified opportunity.

Bristol-Myers Squibb’s research and development center sat on a manicured campus, just beyond a network of leafy residential streets and imposing stone homes. Inside the gated guard posts, low-slung concrete buildings with dark windows dotted the hillsides. The few trees were planted at regular intervals. The lush grass around the lake had been mowed with such precision that it looked like a striped carpet. Every hundred feet stood an emergency assistance pole, to summon aid if needed. Cars were kept to fifteen miles per hour. Even the lake’s turtles had a demarcated crossing lane.

The orderly grounds reflected the painstaking research that went on there. Scientists from this campus developed drugs that had entered the worldwide lexicon, from Pravachol for high cholesterol to Plavix to prevent blood clots. Decades earlier, what was then Squibb had developed an antibiotic to treat tuberculosis, for which its scientists won the prestigious Lasker Award. Bristol-Myers had forged new ground in cancer research. In 1989, the two companies merged. Nine years later, Bristol-Myers Squibb was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation at a White House ceremony.

Thakur played a small but cutting-edge role in the company’s endeavors. He ran a department that built robots, automated laboratory helpmates intended to make the work of drug testing more efficient and reliable. Thakur’s lab buzzed with innovation. More than a dozen scientists reported to him. Pulleys, motors, bells, and levers were scattered about, and bright-eyed college students cycled through, pitching in as needed. Thakur set his own hours, which were long and sometimes involved staying overnight to watch the robots. They needed to repeat the same tasks faultlessly, with the goal of eliminating human error from the laboratory.

The results often did not turn out as desired, which was standard for a manufacturing scale-up. On these occasions, Thakur and his team were forced to scrap their work and start again. Yet they felt confident that the company viewed these failures as a normal part of the scientific process. When it came to Thakur’s lab activity, the old advertising slogan from Squibb seemed to still hold sway:「The priceless ingredient in every product is the honor and integrity of its maker.」

The work, with its scrupulous attention to detail, suited Thakur’s temperament. He was promoted steadily with strong performance reviews, one of which noted that he was「very logical, ethical and loyal」in dealing with peers and superiors. Over six years, he had steadily ascended to his hard-won title: Director, Discovery Informatics.

Punctual as ever, he made his way to the walking path that looped around the lake, where his older colleague, Rashmi Barbhaiya, was waiting. Heavy-set, with snowy white hair and dark circles beneath his eyes, Barbhaiya had been developing drugs at BMS for twenty-one years. He had an intimidating aura and the smooth manner of a senior executive. By contrast, Thakur was reserved and somewhat awkward, with little gift for small talk. But this had not hindered him at BMS, where few people understood his robotics work or sought to discuss it.

Both men were originally from India. Two years prior, Thakur had built an automated computer program for Barbhaiya’s group. More recently, as Barbhaiya oversaw BMS’s purchase of a small pharmaceutical company, he’d tapped Thakur to help transfer and reconcile the data. Today Barbhaiya was about to propose an opportunity Thakur did not predict.

As they walked along the footpath, Barbhaiya disclosed that he was leaving BMS—and the United States—to become the research and development director of India’s largest drug company, Ranbaxy Laboratories, which made generic medicine. Thakur was surprised. Barbhaiya had spent his whole career climbing to the upper ranks of one of the world’s top pharmaceutical research companies. At BMS, he had lived and breathed the prestige of creating new molecules. He’d become a recognized expert in whittling down the long odds that any drug maker undertakes when setting out to develop a new cure.

But Barbhaiya was planning to leave it all behind. To go from the brand-name sector in the United States to the generic one in India. By name, it was the same work—pharmaceutical research—but it was a seismic identity shift. The BMSes of the world invented. The Ranbaxys of the world duplicated. BMS did innovative science versus Ranbaxy’s copycat engineering. But the more Barbhaiya explained his decision, the less skeptical Thakur became.

In India, Ranbaxy was legendary, and the family that built it, the Singhs, were hailed as corporate royalty. As one of India’s oldest and most successful multinationals, Ranbaxy had reinvented the perceived capabilities of an Indian corporation. In 2001, it was on track to clock $1 billion in global sales, with its U.S. sales reaching $100 million after only three years in the American market. The FDA had already approved over a dozen of its drug applications. Ranbaxy had offices and manufacturing plants around the world, including in the United States, but was headquartered in India. Looking to the future, Ranbaxy was going to be investing heavily in innovative research. The company was aiming to develop new molecules. Barbhaiya would be building the company’s research capacity, almost from the ground up.「Why don’t you come with me?」he proposed.「You’ll be closer to your parents and doing something for the country.」

It was an offer that, on the face of it, made little sense. BMS had paid for Thakur’s ongoing schooling, a master’s program in computer engineering. He’d received years of in-house training on the best manufacturing and laboratory practices. But like Barbhaiya, Thakur knew that the ground was shifting beneath his feet. The generic drug business was booming around the world. Generic drugs—legally produced copies of brand-name drugs—comprised half of the U.S. drug supply, a number that was steadily growing. The patents that protected dozens of best-selling drugs, from Lipitor to Plavix, would expire within the next decade, meaning that generics companies would be able to manufacture and sell copies approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With the demand for generics growing, all their jobs would be reconfigured soon enough. One of the main drivers behind this shift was India itself, which was fast becoming a global player in the pharmaceutical industry.

As Thakur contemplated the pros and cons of Barbhaiya’s offer, he had a further thought. The goal in the brand-name world was to make the best possible drugs for the highest possible price. It was the heyday of the branded drug industry, with companies reaping billions in profits on the success of big-name drugs. The largesse at BMS reflected this. Office Christmas parties included caviar and champagne. Sometimes Thakur caught an empty seat on the corporate helicopter that shuttled executives between the company’s hubs in Princeton, New Jersey, and Wallingford, Connecticut, marveling at the easy commute for those at higher pay grades.

In the generic world, the culture would be different because the goal was different: to make the best cures affordable and available to all. But it would mean leaving the United States, where he’d spent decades focused on building the best possible life he could.

Thakur had first come to know America through its movies. In college, as an engineering student in Hyderabad, he had gone to see classic films such as Citizen Kane and Gone with the Wind.

In college, he took the GRE, applied to graduate programs in the United States, and got a scholarship to the University of New Hampshire, where he lived in the graduate dorm as one of only a few minority students. He had never been out of India before, had never seen snow. In his new home, he marveled at the beauty of the White Mountains, the serenity of old New England towns, each with its own church and town square. He drove to Acadia National Park whenever he could and loved biking its rocky shoreline. Otherwise, he studied almost continuously, producing a doorstop of a master’s thesis, which he later published in a journal under the title「Soluble and Immobilized Catalase: Effect of Pressure and Inhibition on Kinetics and Deactivation.」

Shortly after graduating, he was hired by a small biotechnology company to help automate its laboratories. There, though a picture of Thakur and his robots made it into the company’s annual report, his unsupportive boss told him that he lacked the requisite talent for the job. So he moved on to BMS, where he continued the same work successfully.

As he climbed the corporate ladder, his mother grew worried that he had not yet married. Through a family connection, his parents visited the parents of a young woman named Sonal Kalchuri, who was fun loving and well educated and had long dark hair and almond eyes. Thakur met her on a trip to Mumbai, and the two began a phone relationship and correspondence over the following eight months.

In most ways, they were opposites. He was compulsively organized. She was laid-back. He was a workaholic who「never let his hair down,」as she put it. She was social and loved parties. But they shared an interest in science. Sonal was just completing her undergraduate degree in engineering. And they both loved to sing. His childhood home had been filled with music. Both his parents sang in the classical Hindustan style. Over the years, Thakur had developed an excellent voice and a love of the genre’s sinuous improvisations. He and Sonal would go on to perform together in classical Hindustani bands.

They married in 1995 and had a traditional days-long wedding, with both of them draped in flowers. Thakur wore the customary turban for grooms. Sonal was wreathed in gold jewelry, and her hands were hennaed with intricate patterns. She loved the event, but Thakur found the socializing taxing. Afterward, the couple made a home in Syracuse, and he returned to work. For Sonal, the transition was painful. The twenty-three-year-old had never been away from her family before. Now she was alone in a house in a foreign country.

Nonetheless, she enrolled in a computer-engineering graduate program at Syracuse University and emerged with a master’s degree. She got an excellent job at the Carrier Corporation as a software engineer. Thakur moved up steadily at BMS. In 1999, he was promoted to an associate director position. This involved a move from the Syracuse office to the research institute in Hopewell, New Jersey, just a few miles from the company’s Princeton offices. The couple found a spacious home with a high-ceilinged family room that appealed particularly to Sonal. They were getting ready to start their own family.

Their son, Ishan, was born a week after the 9/11 attacks. The Princeton area was devastated. Typically, the parking lot at the Princeton Junction train station filled with the cars of workers who commuted an hour to their Manhattan jobs every weekday, then emptied every night. But after 9/11, cars remained, waiting for commuters who never returned from work.

Though Ishan was born amid tragedy, he brought unalloyed joy into the Thakurs’ lives. Sonal’s mother came to stay for eight months. And Thakur’s parents came to visit, too, for the first time since he’d left for graduate school in the United States eleven years earlier. It was during these hectic months that Barbhaiya proposed to Thakur that he return to India.

Thakur did not immediately share the offer with Sonal. He continued to think about it quietly, as his work progressed at BMS. The family moved again, to Belle Mead, New Jersey, which had better schools and was closer to Sonal’s work. Thakur continued his ongoing schooling, a master’s program in computer engineering, for which BMS was paying. And in-house training in the best manufacturing and laboratory practices also continued. To leave all of this for an Indian generics company seemed like a big step down.

But Thakur was getting restless at BMS and knew that he’d probably risen as far as he could, with little opportunity—at least in the short run—for further advancement. During a summer vacation in 2002, he went to India and stopped by Ranbaxy’s research and development center in Gurgaon. He was impressed by the company’s bustle and sense of potential. He’d have far more freedom and authority there. The offer was excellent. To his surprise, Sonal also became interested. She missed her family and wanted to return home. They resolved to give it a try.

Thakur set about recruiting several members of his BMS team. It struck his colleague Venkat Swaminathan, a software engineer, as an exciting opportunity. If Ranbaxy was really looking to develop new medications, it could be a welcome change from BMS’s restrictive bureaucracy. Dinesh Kasthuril, too, was intrigued. Though he loved his current job and was halfway through Wharton business school, also on BMS’s dime, he was impressed that Ranbaxy wanted to try to develop new drugs. And though they were all born in India, none of them had ever worked there before. All three wanted to contribute to their native country’s emergence onto the world stage.「A lot of it was from the heart,」Kasthuril recalled.

Their similar views further bolstered Sonal’s confidence about the move. She felt that her young family would have friendship and support. The three colleagues thought of themselves as setting off on a momentous adventure: to help build an Indian company dedicated to research, a Pfizer for the twenty-first century. Even as Kasthuril’s boss at BMS tried to convince him not to leave, he had to acknowledge that Dinesh Thakur was「able to see things further」than most people could.

Three months before their departure for India, Thakur achieved a long-awaited milestone: he became an American citizen, a fact that he noted proudly atop his curriculum vitae. But by then, he and his colleagues had set their course.

0101眼光长远的男人

2001 年晚 | 新泽西州霍普韦尔

迪内希·萨库尔（Dinesh S. Thakur）是个一丝不苟的人。他下身穿着条熨得整整齐齐的卡其裤，上身是一件系着领扣的衬衫，外面罩着一件深色运动上衣，脚上是擦得锃亮的休闲皮鞋。他身高中等，人很结实，一张圆脸，长着浓密的深色头发，他的眼窝很深，给人一种忧郁的感觉。这是一个寒冷的下午，树叶刚刚泛出金色和深红。这位 33 岁的信息科学家沿着长满青草的斜坡，向一片人工湖走去。在整个百时美施贵宝公司（以下简称 BMS）园区里，这是人们最爱流连的地方，员工们到这里来清醒头脑，或者逃避严密管束的企业文化，虽然只有午餐时间的那一个小时。但是今天萨库尔来，却是奉了一位年龄较大、职位较高的同事的命令。那人请他到湖边散步，讨论一个工作机会，具体内容他没有明说。

BMS 的研发中心叫坐落于一块修剪整齐的园区，它的边上是一片长满树木的居民区和壮观的石头住宅。进入保安守卫的大门，只见山坡上满低矮的混凝土建筑，窗户都是黑色的。寥寥几棵树木以固定的间距种植。环湖的绿色草坪修剪得十分精致，看起来像一块带条纹的地毯。每隔 100 英尺竖立着一根紧急援助杆，需要时可以呼叫援助。汽车的速度限制在每小时 15 英里。就连湖里的乌龟也有专门划出的过街道路。

整齐的场地对应的是这里细致的研究。由这个园区的科学家开发的药物已经进入全世界的语汇库，从治疗高胆固醇的普拉固（Pravachol），到防止血液凝结的波立维（Plavix）。几十年前，当时的施贵宝公司开发了一种抗生素用于治疗肺结核，为此，公司的科学家获得了声望卓著的拉斯克奖。当时的百时美公司也在癌症研究方面开辟了新领域。1989 年，两家公司合并。又过了九年，BMS 在白官的一场典礼上被授予了国家技术与创新奖章。萨库尔在公司的事业中扮演一个微小但前沿的角色。他管理的部门专门制造机器人，这种自动化实验室帮手能使药物检测变得更加高效可靠。萨库尔的实验室里充满创意。他领导着十几位科学家。滑轮、马达、铃铛和杠杆散放在各处。眼神明亮的大学生来来往往，有需要时就会过来帮忙。萨库尔自己安排作息，他会连续工作很久，有时还会通宵监测机器人。它们必须精确无误地重复同样的工作，为的是消除实验室中人类的差错。

但工作结果往往不尽如人意，这在生产规模的升级中也是常有的事。每当这时，萨库尔和他的团队就只能尽弃前功，从头再来。但是他们确信，公司会把这些错误视作科研过程中的正常现象。就萨库尔在实验室的工作而言，施贵宝的那句旧广告词仍可以成为他的座右铭：「生产者的荣誉和正直，在每件产品中是无价的。」

这份工作需要对细节一丝不荀的专注，这很符合萨库尔的性情。他在公司稳步升迁，绩效考核优异，其中一条说他对待同事和上级「逻辑清晰，严守伦理，忠于公司」。六年中，他通过努力不断升职，最终得了今天的头衔：发现信息学部主任。

萨库尔和往常一样准时，来到了绕湖一周的步道，他的老同事拉希米：巴布海亚（Rashmi Barbhaiya）已经在那里等候了。巴布海亚身材魁梧，头白发，眼睛下面挂着两轮黑眼圈，他在 BMS 做药物开发已经 21 年了。他的身上散发着高级主管的威严气度，举止优雅。与他相比，萨库尔就显得沉默了，甚至还有些笨拙，不太擅长与人寒睻。但这一点并没有妨碍他在 BMS 的事业，同事们很少理解他的机器人研究，也不会找他讨论。

两个人都来自度。两年前，萨库尔为巴布海亚的团队编写了一个自动计算机程序。后来巴布海亚在负责公司对一家小型药企的收购时，也曾借调萨库尔去帮忙转移和整合数据。今天，巴布海亚将给出一个萨库尔不曾预料的机会。

当两人沿着步道行走时，巴布海亚告诉萨库尔，他即将离开 BMS、离开美国，他要到即度最大的制药公司兰伯西实验室去做研发主管，而那家公司是专做仿制药的。萨库尔听了很吃惊。巴布海亚整个职业生涯都致力于在这家世界顶尖的药物研究企业中向上攀升。在 BMS，他因开发新分子而备受尊敬。他已经被公认为提高新药研发成功率的专家，而任何制药商在开发新药时，都不得不面对成功率低下的问题。

然而，巴布海亚打算抛下这一切。他要离开美国的品牌药产业，转投印度的仿制药产业。从名义上说，还是同样的工作一药学研究，但实际上，这却是一次剧烈的身份转变：BMS 的世界是创造的世界，兰伯西的世界是复制的世界。BMS 做创新科研，兰伯西只会拙劣地模仿。不过，随着巴布海亚对自己的决定做了更多的说明，萨库尔的怀疑渐渐消除了。

在印度，兰伯西是一家传奇企业，它的创立者辛格家族也被誉为企业界的皇室。作为印度历史最悠久也最成功的跨国企业之一，兰伯西使外界对印度企业的实力刮目相看。2001 年，它的全球销售额即将达到计划的 10 亿美元，此时它进入美国市场不过三年，在美国的销售额已经达到 1 亿美元了。美国药监局也已经批准了其十几项药物申请。兰伯西在世界各地都设立了办事处和工厂，包括美国在内，但总部仍在印度。展望未来，兰伯西将会大力投资创新研究，目标是开发新的分子。巴布海亚将去打造公司的研发能力，几乎是从零开始。「跟我一起去怎么样？」他向萨库尔提议，「那样你可以回到父母身边，也能为自己的国家做一点事。」

从表面上看，这个提议一点都不合情理。BMS 为萨库尔的教育出了钱，资助他取得了计算机工程的硕士学位。他还接受了几年的内部培训，掌握了最佳的生产和实验环节的操作方法。但是和巴布海亚一样，他也感到了形势正在发生转变。仿制药产业在全世界正欣欣向荣。所谓仿制药就是依法生产的品牌药的复制品，当时它们已经占美国药物供应量的一半，而且这个比例还在稳步增加。再过不到 10 年，为几十种畅销药（包括立普妥和波立维）提供保护的专利就将过期，也就是说，只要得到美国药监局的批准，仿制药公司就可以生产并销售这些药物的复制版了。随着仿制药需求的日渐增长，所有的工作岗位都将很快重组。而这个转变的主要推手之一就是印度，迅速成为全球制药业的一位主要参与者。

当萨库尔对巴布海亚的建议权衡利弊时，他产生了一个更长远的想法牌药世界的目标是做出最好的药，卖出最高的价格。当时仍是品牌药产业的全盛时期，靠着那些著名药物的成功，制药企业赚到了数十亿美元的利润。BMS 的慷慨就体现了这一点：办公室的圣诞联欢会上有鱼子酱和香槟酒。公司的直升机载着高管们在新泽西州普林斯顿总部和康涅狄格州沃灵福德分部之间穿梭，偶尔萨库尔也能在上面坐到一个空位，并惊叹那些收入级别更高的员工竟能如此方便地通勤。

而那个仿制药的世界将是另一种不同的文化，因为它有着另外的目标同样是最好的药，它要让所有患者都看得起、看得上病。但那意味着他要离开美国，过去几十年他一直待在这个国家，一心追求他能得到的最好生活。萨库尔最初了解美国是通过电影。在海得拉巴念大学工科时，他看了《公民凯恩》（Citizen Kane）和《乱世佳人》（Gone With the Wind）这样的经典影片。

在大学里，他报考了 GRE，申请了美国的研究生项目，并得到了新罕布什尔大学的奖学金。到了美国，他住在研究生宿舍里，周围只有寥寥几个少数族裔学生。他之前从未离开过印度，也从没看到过雪。在这个新的家园，他惊叹怀特山的壮美、新英格兰老镇的静谧以及每个镇子都有自己的教堂和广场。他一有机会就开车去阿卡迪亚国家公园，他很喜欢在公园中布满岩石的海岸线上骑自行车。旅行之外，他几乎一刻不停地学习，写出了厚厚的一沓硕士论文，后来文章在一份期刊上发表，题目是《可溶及固定的过氧化氢酶：压力和抑制对其动力学及钝化作用的影响》。

毕业之后不久，他被一家小型生物技术公司雇用，负责实验室的自动化工作。虽然他和他那些机器人的一张合照登上了公司年报，但是老板对他并不支持，还说他缺乏这份工作所需的才能。于是他跳到了 BMS，在那里顺利开展了同样的工作。正当他在公司一路晋升时，他的母亲却担忧起了他的终身大事。通过家里一个熟人的介绍，他的父母拜访了另一对父母，他们有一个年轻的女儿名叫苏娜尔·卡尔楚利（Sonal Kalchuri），她性格活泼，教养良好，有着长长的黑色秀发和一双眼。有一次，萨库尔去孟买出差时和她见了面，在之后的八个月里，两人通过电话和书信开始了交往。

在大多数方面，这两个人都正好相反。他极有条理，几乎像强迫症，而她随意放松。他是个工作狂，用她的话来说「从来不知道松弛享乐」。而她善于社交，热爱聚会。然而两人对科学有着共同的兴趣，苏娜尔刚刚念完工程本科。他们都很喜欢唱歌。他小的时候家里就处处洋溢着音乐，父母都会用经典的印度斯坦曲调歌唱。长年熏陶之下，萨库尔也练出了一副动听的歌喉，并爱上了这类音乐婉转曲折的即兴哼唱方式。他后来和苏娜尔一同加入传统的印度斯坦乐队表演。

他们在 1995 年结婚，传统的婚礼延续数天，两人身上戴满了花朵。萨库尔按照习俗戴上新郎头巾。苏娜尔周身挂满金饰，手掌上还画了精细的曼海蒂图案。她很喜欢这个仪式，但萨库尔觉得招呼客人很累人。婚后小夫妻在锡拉丘兹安家，萨库尔重新上班去了。对于苏娜尔，这个转变是痛苦的。这个 23 岁的姑娘以前从没离开过家乡，现在却要独自守在异国的一座房子里。

不过她很快报名了雪城大学的一个计算机工程的硕士项目，并拿到了硕士学位。她在开利公司找到了一份软件工程师的好工作。萨库尔则在 BMS 稳步上升。1999 年，他被提升为副主任。这需要他从锡拉丘兹办公室搬到新泽西州霍普韦尔的研究所，办公地点离公司的普林斯顿办公室仅几英里之遥。夫妇俩找了一个宽敞的住处，起居室有高高的天花板，苏娜尔特喜欢。现在他们准备孕育下一代了。

他们的儿子伊斯汗（Ishan）于「9·11」袭击后一周诞生。当时普林斯顿地区遭到了毁灭性的打击。以前，普林斯顿火车枢纽站的停车场里总是停满汽车，每个工作日，汽车的主人都要花一个小时赶去曼哈顿上班，到了夜里，停车场又会变得空荡荡。然而「9·11」之后，许多汽车都留在了那里等侯着始终不曾归来的上班族。

伊斯汗虽然在悲剧中出生，却给萨库尔夫妇的生活带来了纯粹的快乐。苏娜尔的母亲过来住了八个月。萨库尔的父母也来探望他们，自从萨库尔 11 年前离开家乡去美国念研究生，他的父母还是第一次来美国。正是在那段紧张而忙碌的日子里，巴布海亚向他提出了回到印度的建议。

萨库尔没有马上把这个消息告诉苏娜尔。他一边继续在 BMS 的工作，边不动声色地思索着。他们再次搬家，搬到了新泽西州的贝尔米德，那里的学校更好，离苏娜尔工作的地方也比较近。萨库尔接着念他的计算机工程硕士，学费由 BMS 支付。在生产和实验室最佳操作方法方面的内部培训也在继续。要抛下这一切去一家印度的仿制药公司，似乎是职业生涯的一大倒退。

但是，萨库尔渐渐在 BMS 感到不满足了，他知道自己多半已经升到顶了，前面已经没有多少机会可以让他更上一层楼一一至少短期看是这样的。2002 年夏天，他趁休假的机会去了一次印度，并参观了兰伯西在古尔冈的研发中心。这家公司的繁忙和潜力使他印象深刻。在这里，他的自由和权力都将大大提升。公司开出的条件很好。令他意外的是，苏娜尔也显得很感兴趣。她想念家人，也想回家。夫妇俩决定试一试。

萨库尔开始在他的 BMS 团队里招人。他的同事、软件工程师文卡特·斯瓦米纳坦（Venkat Swaminathan）觉得这是一次激动人心的机会。兰伯西没有 BMS 那种处处受限的官僚风气，如果它真想开发新药，这将是一次令人愉快的转变。迪内希·卡斯胡里尔（Dinesh Kasthurill）也很感兴趣。虽然他很喜欢手头的工作，并在 BMS 的资助下学完了沃顿商学院一半的课程，但是他对兰伯西开发新药的计划感到十分佩服。三个人虽然都在印度出生，但谁也没有在那里工作过。祖国将要崛起于世界舞台，他们都想贡献一分力量。「许多东西都是发自内心的。」卡斯胡里尔回忆说。

这些相似的观点让苏娜尔对搬回印度更有信心。她觉得他们这个年轻的家庭能在祖国找到友情和支持。在萨库尔和两位同事看来，自己踏上的是一段意义重大的冒险之旅：他们将要建设一家致力于研究的印度公司、一家 21 世纪的辉瑞。卡斯胡里尔在 BMS 的上级劝他不要离开，但他也承认迪内希·萨库尔能比大多数人「看得更远」。

就在几个人动身返回印度的三个月前，萨库尔达成了一个他期盼已久的里程碑式的目标：他成为美国公民了。他自豪地把这一点写到了简历的最上方。不过这时，他和同事们已经确定好航向，准备驶离美国了。

## 0102. The Gold Rush

AUGUST 17, 2002

New Delhi, India

On a humid day one year before Dinesh Thakur arrived at Ranbaxy, a company executive boarded a plane at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, bound for Newark, New Jersey. He’d left the office in a「crazy rush,」an employee recalled, to catch the almost sixteen-hour flight.

His mission was top-secret. In his luggage were five binders, each about three inches thick, containing reams of data. The documents comprised key portions of what would become an Abbreviated New Drug Application or ANDA, to be filed with the FDA. The application, once completed, would become known in industry parlance as a「jacket.」

But this was no run-of-the-mill jacket. The executive carried the most potentially lucrative dossier ever compiled in the generic drug world: the data the company would use in its application to make the first U.S. generic version of the world’s best-selling drug of all time: Lipitor. Pfizer’s vaunted cholesterol fighter was「the Sultan of Statins,」as Wall Street analysts called it. The molecule itself, atorvastatin calcium, was a descendant of Nobel Prize–winning science. Coupled with Pfizer’s marketing might, it had become the world’s first `$10`-billion-a-year drug.

Had the Ranbaxy executive’s mission been known, a good portion of people in the United States—from patient advocates to members of Congress to the 11 million Americans who relied on Lipitor to lower their cholesterol—would have welcomed him. Everyone in America, it seemed, wanted cheap equivalent drugs. State and federal budgets were buckling under astronomical drug costs. Brand-name Lipitor, though less expensive than its competitors, cost the many uninsured Americans who depended on it roughly `$800` a year. Even for some with insurance, the copays alone were a reach.

In theory, the contents of Ranbaxy’s binders could solve that. The data showed that Ranbaxy’s version reached roughly the same level of absorption in the bloodstream as Pfizer’s and used the same active ingredient, the atorvastatin calcium molecule. If all the claims in its application were true, Ranbaxy’s version of the drug would be a godsend for American patients.

At Newark airport, the sun had just risen when a waiting car whisked the man to 600 College Road East in Princeton, New Jersey, Ranbaxy’s U.S. corporate headquarters. There the regulatory team—headed by Abha Pant, an intense company loyalist and the only woman to have climbed into Ranbaxy’s executive ranks—immediately got to work, combining the core documents from the five binders with other necessary paperwork.

By that night, the final submission was ready. It spanned seventeen volumes and totaled more than 7,500 pages. The jacket covered four different dosage strengths that Ranbaxy planned to make and package at its plant in Paonta Sahib, in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The application was handed off to an overnight courier and arrived at the FDA’s Rockville, Maryland, campus the next morning, where it was stamped「RECEIVED: August 19, 2002.」

But neither Pant nor her colleagues were satisfied, because they had no idea if they’d filed first, which was what mattered most. The first company to file its application, if approved, won the exclusive right to sell the generic for six months, before others joined in. There was a rumor that the generic drug company Teva had already filed. And word had it that the generics companies Sandoz, Mylan, and Barr had also been doing clinical tests. Days and weeks went by with ominous silence.

Inside the FDA, Ranbaxy’s application—the cornerstone of the company’s plans to reach `$1` billion in U.S. sales by 2015—became Abbreviated New Drug Application 76-477. Meanwhile, Ranbaxy executives waited.

Jeffrey Myers, Pfizer’s senior patent attorney, was in his office at the company’s headquarters on East Forty-Second Street in Midtown Manhattan when he got the notice—a generic drug company had filed an application to make generic Lipitor. That application contained a full-on challenge of the Lipitor patent, known as a「paragraph IV certification.」Myers sat up straighter in his chair. At that point, Lipitor had been on the market for five years, and its patents were not set to expire until 2011.

Myers learned of patent challenges all the time, but this one drew his attention.「We didn’t have any forewarning,」he recalled.

Of course, Myers knew this day would come. But he was expecting the challenge to come from a well-established generics company, like Mylan or Sandoz. He regularly had lunch with his counterparts from those companies. This was the first challenge he’d ever gotten from an Indian company, one he barely knew. To him, the move was about as legitimate as a pirate scaling the side of his ocean liner.

As he scrutinized the fine print of Ranbaxy’s challenge, he began to see problems. The drug had to be in the same dosage form. Lipitor was sold in tablets. Ranbaxy had filed for capsules, as though its chemists had never seen the original drug. It also proposed to make it in a different molecular form, amorphous rather than crystalline—which was a trick, as Myers well knew, since Pfizer scientists had tried for years to make an amorphous version but had failed because the drug became highly unstable.

Lipitor could not be replicated with ease. It had taken a team of scientists to formulate, the industry’s best marketers to launch, and a manufacturing team that understood its intricacies and challenges. Since 1998, all of the active ingredient for the world’s supply of Lipitor had been made in Cork County, Ireland, at three vast Pfizer-owned plants. Pfizer had expected production to top out with 50 metric tons of active ingredient. Just five years after the drug had launched, that number had quadrupled to 200 tons.

The Ringaskiddy manufacturing plant, which sits on a 200-acre campus and operates twenty-four hours a day, has a「quality culture,」which means that it aims to operate with as close to zero defects as possible. Its employees are routinely trained to GUARD PFIZER QUALITY, as a sign on the wall of one company plant admonished them.

Lipitor is as moody as the slate-gray landscape, but Ringaskiddy has developed a failproof manufacturing system.「The drug is finicky, and we know how to make it,」said Dr. Paul Duffy, Pfizer’s vice president of biopharma manufacturing operations.「When you work with something for twenty years, it’s like your baby, you know its moods.」

In New York, Myers—a lawyer with a PhD in chemistry from Cornell University—suspected that Ranbaxy’s chemists were outclassed in the face of a drug they barely understood and probably couldn’t even make. Given that, he felt an inkling of excitement for the battle that lay ahead.「I live to obliterate these guys,」he later reckoned of his generic drug opponents.「My job is to stop them.」

How you saw Ranbaxy depended on where you sat. Myers’s view from Pfizer’s Midtown Manhattan headquarters was,「once you get down to Ranbaxy, you start to swim with the bottom-feeders.」But in many ways, it was an upstart’s market. The triumphalism of the branded drug industry was being eroded from beneath by a surging generic drug industry that had both public and political support. Once Ranbaxy’s bid to make Lipitor became public, a CNN business reporter assessed it as「a classic David versus Goliath scenario—Pfizer’s revenues are about 50 times the size of its diminutive challenger.」

Prior to 1984, the Ranbaxys of the world had no way to challenge the Pfizers. There was no clear pathway for a generic drug to be approved in the United States. Under FDA rules, even if a drug’s patent had expired, generic drug companies were required to repeat extensive and costly clinical trials, even though the brand companies had already proven the safety and effectiveness of their drugs.

A crusading journalist at the time, William F. Haddad, who relished his role as an underdog, set out to change that. According to one of his colleagues, Haddad had an「extra gland that produces publicity instead of sweat,」and he became a media-savvy advocate for generics. He had first worked as an assistant to Senator Estes Kefauver (D-TN), who, as chair of the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee, had fought for consumer protections and battled the pharmaceutical industry. Kefauver had told Haddad about a suspected Pfizer-led cartel to control the price of the antibiotic tetracycline in Latin America. After Kefauver’s death in 1963, Haddad wrote a high-profile series about the price-fixing cartel for the New York Herald Tribune.

Haddad left journalism and became the head of the all but invisible Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association. With a small cadre of sympathizers, he began lobbying Congress to create a distinct process for the FDA to approve generic drugs. Politically, the brand companies「had control of every avenue,」he recalled. So Haddad and his group walked the hallways of Congress, trying to make their argument to the few who would listen.

The turning point came in the early 1980s, when Haddad got a meeting with Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican. He expected the senator to be aligned with the Big Pharma cause. Unexpectedly, Hatch listened with real engagement and interest. In a two-hour meeting, Haddad explained to the senator that the patents for more than 150 drugs had expired, yet the brand-name medications faced no competition because there was no way to get a generic approved through the FDA. As a result, Americans were forced to pay too much for their medicine.「He was questioning me like a district attorney,」Haddad recalled.

He was stunned when, a few days after the conversation, Hatch called him up and said,「I think you may be right.」The senator joined forces with a Democratic congressman from California, Henry Waxman. Together, they pressured the Big Pharma CEOs into agreement and drafted a law that established a scientific pathway at the FDA to get generic drugs approved. It was the Abbreviated New Drug Application. No longer did generic drug companies have to prove the safety and effectiveness of their drugs from the ground up, as the branded companies did with costly long-term clinical trials. Instead, the companies could win FDA approval with more limited tests to prove their drugs were bioequivalent and performed similarly in the body.

But there was another major hurdle. During the deliberations, one generic drug executive pulled Haddad into a corner and said,「Look, what if I sue and I win. What do I get?」What incentive was strong enough to justify the up-front costs of developing a generic version of a drug, the possibility of litigating against brand-name drug companies intent on defending their patents, and perhaps failing on both counts?

The solution, called the「first-to-file」incentive, transformed the generic drug industry. It allowed the company that first filed its generic application with the FDA to reap a big reward: the right to sell its drug exclusively for six months at close to the brand-name price, before other generic competitors jumped in and the price plunged. Being first became the difference between making a fortune and making a living.

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, which became known as Hatch-Waxman, passed unanimously in the House of Representatives, 362–0, in 1984. Though a huge victory for generic drug makers, it also extended by a few years the length of patents for brand-name companies. President Ronald Reagan signed the legislation in a Rose Garden ceremony that September. Touting the benefits of lower-cost drugs, he told his audience, amid laughter,「Senior citizens require more medication than any other segment of our society. I speak with some authority on that.」

The Hatch-Waxman bill「really started the generics industry,」said Haddad.「It gave it its footing, it gave it its foundation, it allowed the companies to grow, it reduced the prices dramatically.」

It was also clear from the outset that generic drug companies could make a huge profit. The day the bill went into effect, companies sent「tractor trailers full of ANDAs」to the FDA, recalled a former agency bureaucrat.「We got one thousand applications within the first month of the program.」The volume of bids—coupled with the potential jackpot of first-to-file—underscored that a generic drug factory was, as one of the FDA’s earliest generic drug chiefs, Dr. Marvin Seife, claimed,「a place where you put raw materials into a mixing vat, turned the spigot and out comes gold.」

Inside generic drug companies, the first-to-file incentive ignited a frenzy.「Nothing was more important,」said Jay Deshmukh, Ranbaxy’s former senior vice president for global intellectual property. At issue was not just what day the application arrived at the FDA’s Rockville, Maryland, campus, the agency’s headquarters for generic drugs, but in what order.「Minutes mattered,」said Deshmukh.

As the competition grew, so did the waiting. In the run-up to a patent expiration date, it was not uncommon to see generic drug executives asleep in their cars in the FDA parking lot overnight in order to be first at the door when the building opened. Periodically, a tent city would sprout in the parking lot, with executives camping out for weeks at a time. Each company had a strategy for how to wait and how to be first. Some paid line-sitters to wait in the parking lot. Teva booked hotel rooms nearby and rotated staff throughout the night.

On the cold, clear night of December 23, 2002, with Christmas just two days away, the FDA parking lot was crowded. The FDA had shut its doors hours earlier. But representatives from four different generic drug companies—Ranbaxy, Teva, Mylan, and Barr—were waiting in line, stamping their feet and clapping their gloved hands to stay warm. Ranbaxy had sent two of its most reliable staffers in a stretch limousine, so they could take turns sleeping and waiting.

Everyone had just one goal: to be first through the FDA’s doors when the agency opened the next morning. They had all brought applications to make generic versions of a drug called Provigil, manufactured by Cephalon, to combat daytime sleepiness—a bonanza for whichever generics company filed its application first.

As the sky began to lighten, a Ranbaxy executive fully intended to keep his place at the head of the line. But just as the doors opened, a Mylan employee, a petite young woman, pushed him out of the way and rushed through the door to get the coveted time stamp, signifying first place.

Back at Ranbaxy corporate headquarters, the director of U.S. regulatory affairs, Abha Pant, had to console herself with second place. It was not a total loss, because being first was not a guarantee of success. The FDA would consider only applications it deemed「substantially complete.」This was to prevent generics companies from tossing down half-baked applications as placeholders so as to be designated first while they figured out how to actually make the drug. So Pant never gave up hope. Being second was as critical. She would be waiting for the first one to trip and fall.

The FDA struggled to put a stop to the camping problem. In July 2003, the agency amended its rules so that any generics company that delivered its application on a certain set day could potentially share six months of exclusivity. In written guidance to the industry, the FDA noted:

Recently, there have been a number of cases in which multiple ANDA applicants or their representatives have sought to be the first to submit a patent challenge by lining up outside, and literally camping out adjacent to, an FDA building for periods ranging from 1 day to more than 3 weeks. Concerns about liability, security, and safety led the property owners to prohibit lines of applicants before the date submissions may be made.

Though shared exclusivity was somewhat less attractive, first-to-file remained the most lucrative opportunity for generic drug companies.

For Ranbaxy, the applications remained essential to its strategic plan, dubbed「Garuda Vision,」after a soaring Hindu eagle. Lest any employee forget the company’s goal, a framed poster headlined「2015 Strategy」hung on the walls of the New Jersey office. The first bullet point, in bold, was「significant FTF filings annually」below the headline「USA: `$1` billion sustainable profitable business by 2015.」As one of Ranbaxy’s CEOs, Davinder Singh Brar, explained in a company-sponsored book, the billion-dollar dream was a「vision . . . etched in every employee’s mind.」

Inside Ranbaxy, overseeing the first-to-file applications fell to Jay Deshmukh, the lean, sardonic attorney who specialized in intellectual property. Back in 1998, as a bored young lawyer in Cincinnati, he saw a surprising ad in the Journal of the Patent and Trademark Office Society. Ranbaxy was looking for a patent lawyer.「I had never seen an Indian company asking for a patent lawyer,」Deshmukh recalled. He applied on a whim.

Deshmukh, an Indian-born chemical engineer by training, was intrigued by the prospect of working at Ranbaxy, especially after meeting the visionary managing director Dr. Parvinder Singh, whom he found to be「extremely smart and personable.」Deshmukh ended up taking the job and doubled his salary. He relocated his young family to Princeton, New Jersey. Though it seemed like an excellent career move, above all he viewed the job as a「going home kind of thing, contributing to India.」

Knowing little about Indian corporate culture, he immediately found himself in a「very paternalistic」environment, where「your boss is your father—he’s always right.」Deshmukh immediately locked horns with his boss. Within a year of joining the company, he requested a meeting with Parvinder, in which he asked to report directly to the CEO, D. S. Brar, instead. Parvinder consented. In doing so, Deshmukh cemented his future role in the company, as Brar became Ranbaxy’s managing director a year later. It was Brar who encouraged Deshmukh to aim for generic Lipitor.

Inside the company, the Lipitor quest was not just your average commercial endeavor.「The lure of the drug was irresistible, like a gorgeous naked woman who is not your wife,」said Deshmukh.「It’s hard for guys to say no. How could we not?」

On October 9, 2002, almost two months after Ranbaxy had filed Abbreviated New Drug Application 76-477, the FDA broke its silence, first with a phone call and then with an official letter: Ranbaxy had indeed filed first, and its application to make atorvastatin, the company’s generic version of Lipitor, would be evaluated.

The news led to rejoicing inside Ranbaxy. The FDA parking lot had been empty when Ranbaxy filed its application, because the company was so far ahead of its rivals. Now there was a path to the largest generic drug jackpot in history. But huge obstacles remained. First, FDA regulators had to deem the science in the dossier to be worthy. Ranbaxy’s testing data would have to demonstrate, to the agency’s satisfaction, that its generic Lipitor would release an equivalent amount of the active ingredient into a patient’s bloodstream. After that, Ranbaxy would have to survive attack by an army of Pfizer’s patent lawyers, who’d successfully been standing sentinel around the drug for years. Ranbaxy would have to follow the careful choreography, and withstand the scrutiny, of the world’s most dominant drug market.

In theory, all the companies had to follow the same rigid set of good manufacturing practices. But for companies that were inclined to emphasize profits instead of quality, there were many avenues for improvisation—and shortcuts. Deshmukh acknowledged that the incentive of first-to-file created a「Wild West」environment in which companies had to not only become first filers but protect those applications at all costs. That drive—to be first and stay first—led to a stark choice for Ranbaxy, just months before Dinesh Thakur arrived at the company.

In May 2003, Ranbaxy’s top executives gathered in the conference room of a hotel in Boca Raton, Florida, for what was supposed to be a nuts-and-bolts operational meeting. The company CEO, D. S. Brar, presided in his impeccable turban. Rashmi Barbhaiya, the director of research and development who had recruited Thakur, was there. So was company president Brian Tempest. Their discussion was quickly subsumed by a topic that had dominated email chains and led to the creation of a closely guarded report, its contents restricted to those in the room.

Three months earlier, the company had launched Sotret, its version of the brand-name anti-acne drug Accutane made by Roche, onto the U.S. market. As the first low-cost version available to American patients, it resulted in instant market share and was another vital step toward the company’s larger goal to achieve `$5` billion in global sales within a decade.

But just a few days prior to the meeting, the Ranbaxy executives had suspended the profitable Sotret launch. They told U.S. regulators that they had seen a「downward trend」in how rapidly the 40-milligram capsule dissolved and would temporarily withdraw three lots of it from the market while they completed their probe of the cause. But that was a lie. Their random tests of Sotret had shown that the formulation was failing. Under rules set by the FDA, they had but one choice: to make a full disclosure to regulators, recall Sotret from the market, and return to the laboratory to try to reengineer the drug until it worked.

Unless there was another choice.「Go find Malik,」snapped Brar, glaring at his deputies, one of whom went scrambling from the conference room in his direction. Rajiv Malik, a canny and ebullient process chemist who was Ranbaxy’s head of formulation development and regulatory affairs, was viewed by his colleagues as a Houdini of the generic drug world. He had unsurpassed skills at reverse-engineering and seemed to know how to turn anything into anything. If the problem could be escaped, he’d figure out how.

On that day, the usually jovial Malik—who’d been with the company on and off for eighteen years—appeared uneasy as he entered the room. Malik had led the laboratory effort to develop Sotret. Now his colleagues wanted him to fix the situation quickly. He could feel their impatience.

「This is not a quick-fix problem,」he told the group.「I don’t have a magic wand.」

For his visibly frustrated Ranbaxy colleagues, Malik then reviewed the excruciating history of the Sotret development he’d overseen. Despite more than five years of costly laboratory work, Ranbaxy’s chemists still could not get the drug to dissolve correctly. As a soft gel product in a suspended form, it was difficult to control the particle size.

The batches they’d tested for approval from the FDA had been manufactured in a controlled environment and had finally worked well enough, mimicking the original drug. But when they’d scaled up the manufacturing to create commercial-sized batches, impurity levels spiked and the drug dissolved incorrectly. Malik explained his working hypothesis: that when the soft gelatin was exposed to oxygen, it set off a reaction that affected the dissolution. It would take time to engineer a solution. In the meantime, they would need to stop selling the drug.

「I have no idea how long it will be before Sotret can be marketed,」he told the executives.

He hadn’t said what everyone in the room already knew. Even if formulated perfectly, the drug was uniquely dangerous. The FDA required a「black box」warning on the label, alerting patients that the drug could cause severe birth defects or miscarriages if taken while pregnant or prompt suicidal tendencies in those who took it, many of whom were teenagers. The drug, in its brand version, had been the subject of a congressional hearing after a U.S. congressman’s son had killed himself while taking it. To restrict the drug, regulators required companies to report any sales, expiration, or destruction of it. The dangers demanded caution and transparency.

Given the circumstances, the FDA’s regulations required Ranbaxy executives to withdraw the drug from the market and suspend making it until the failures could be remedied. But the heated discussion kept returning to the commercial pressures. If the company fumbled, there would be a rival drug maker waiting to launch its own version right behind them. Not marketing the drug would gut their profits.

Malik looked around the table. He saw「irrationality,」as he later put it, in the mind-set of his colleagues. The executives who ringed the conference table faced a stark choice. Stopping the launch would mean abandoning the company’s financial goals. Continuing it with no further disclosure to regulators would endanger patients and violate the FDA’s rules.

The push for profits won out. They chose to continue the launch and conceal the problems from regulators, even as they returned to the laboratory in search of a solution. Years later, D. S. Brar would say that he could not remember the Boca Raton meeting specifically, but remarked of his tenure at Ranbaxy,「Nowhere at any time did I hear any executive say that we shall short-circuit the process and the procedure to circumvent time to market.」To the contrary, he added,「we were always very scared to do anything which would go wrong in the U.S. That was the kind of scrutiny the company had internally.」

But shortly after the Sotret meeting, the executives memorialized the faulty quality of their acne drug in a document titled「Sotret—Investigation Report,」which Abha Pant, the vice president of regulatory affairs, later filed away in her office at the company’s New Jersey headquarters. The cover page read, in bold letters,「Do Not Give to FDA.」

0102药海淘金

2002 年 8 月 17 日 | 印度新德里

就在迪内希·萨库尔到兰伯西任职的前一年，在一个潮湿的目子里，名公司高管在英迪拉·甘地国际机场登上了一架飞机，准备飞往美国新泽西州的组瓦克。一名员工回忆说，他是在「狂热而匆忙」间离开办公室，去搭那班近 16 个小时的航班的。他的任务是最高机密。在他的行李箱里装了 5 个文件夹，每个约 3 英寸厚，包含上千页数据。这些文件中包含了将要提交给美国药监局的「简化新药申请」（Abbreviated New Drug Application，缩写 ANDA）的关键部分。申请一旦完成，就会变成行业术语中所谓的「封套」。

但这可不是什么普通的封套。这名高管携带的是仿制药领域有史以来最具利润潜力的文件：公司将用这些数据申请史上最畅销药物立普妥在美国的第一版仿制药。这款辉瑞公司引以为豪的胆固醇斗士，被华尔街的分析师称为「他汀类药物中的权威」。其中包含的分子阿托伐他汀钙（atorvastatin  calcium）本身就是一项得诺贝尔奖的科学发现。再加上辉瑞的营销力量，它成为世界上第一款每年销售百亿美元的药物 [2]。

要是将这名兰伯西高管的任务公之于众，许多美国人都会对他表示欢迎，其中包括患者代理人、国会议员以及 1100 万靠立普妥降低胆固醇的美国患者。每一个美国人似乎都希望能用上廉价的等效药。州和联邦预算已经在药物的天价成本面前不堪重负了。品牌立普妥虽然比它的竞争者便宜，但是对许多没买保险却靠它治病的美国人来说，每年也要花掉近 800 美元。即使对一些买了保险的人来说，自己也还是有一笔不菲的自付费用要出。

从理论上说，兰伯西那 5 个文件夹里的内容可以解决这个问题。数据显示，兰伯西的仿制版达到了和辉瑞的原版几乎相同的血液吸收率，使用的也是相同的有效成分阿托伐他汀钙分子。如果申请书中的所有陈述都真实可靠，那么兰伯西的仿制版药物就会成为美国患者的天赐礼物。

纽瓦克机场的太阳刚刚升起，一辆等候已久的汽车載上男人，一路飞驰，将他送往新泽西州普林斯顿市大学东路 600 号，那是兰伯西美国总部的所在地。在那里，法规事务团队「领头的是艾卜哈·潘特（Abha Pant），唯跻身兰伯西高管行列的女性，也是公司的一名忠诚卫士」立刻开始工作，将 5 个文件夹内的核心文件和其他必要的文书组合在一起。

当天夜里，最后的提交工作准备就绪。它包含了 17 大卷共 7500 多页的文件。这个封套涵盖了四种剂量强度的药物信息，兰伯西公司计划在印度北部喜马偕尔邦的帕奥恩塔萨希布工厂中进行生产和包装。公司连夜叫了个快递员，第二天早晨就把包裹送到了位于马里兰州罗克维尔的美国药监局园区，它被盖上了「2002 年 8 月 19 日收讫」的章。

然而潘特和她的同事们并不满足，因为他们不知道自己是不是第一个提交申请的，那是最重要的事。第一家提交申请的公司，一获得批准，就取得了在六个月内独家销售仿制药的权利，在那之后其他公司オ可以加入生产行列。有传闻说，另一家仿制药公司梯瓦已经抢先提交了申请。还有传闻说，仿制药公司山德士、迈兰和巴尔也一直在开展临床试验。在一阵令人不安的沉默中，日子一天天、一周周地过去了。

兰伯西的计划是到 2015 年在美国的销售额达到 10 亿美元，而这份申请就是整个计划的基石，在美国药监局，它被标记为「简化新药申请 76-477 号」。与此同时，兰伯西的高管们继续等待着。

有一家仿制药公司提交了仿制立普妥的申请。听说这个消息时，辉瑞的高级专利律师杰弗里·迈尔斯（Jeffrey Myers）正在曼哈顿中城东 42 街公司总部的办公室。这份申请是对立普妥专利的全面挑战，即所谓的「第四项认证」。迈尔斯在椅子上坐直了身子。这时立普妥上市才五年，其专利要到 2011 年才会到期。

迈尔斯常常会听到专利受到挑战的消息，对这一次他格外关注。「我们事先没得到任何预警。」他回忆说。他当然知道这一天早是要来的，但他本以为挑战会来自一家名声在外的仿制药公司，比如迈兰或山德士，他平时会定期和这些公司的同行一起吃午餐。这还是他第一次受到一家印度公司的挑战，而且连名字他都没怎么听说过。在他看来，这简直像一条海盗船蹭了他的远洋轮。

当他审视兰伯西挑战文件中的细则时，他意识到辉瑞有麻烦了。要构成侵权，仿制药就必须和品牌药有相同的剂型。然而立普妥是以药片形式出售的，兰伯西申请的却是胶囊，就好像他们的药剂师从来没见过原版的立普妥似的。另外，它申请的分子形式也和原版不同，不是晶体，而是无定型。据迈尔斯所知，这是非常困难的，因为许多年来，辉瑞的科学家一直想做出无定型的版本，但始终没有成功，因为无定型的药物会变得极不稳定。

立普妥绝不是轻易就能复制的药物。当年是一支科学家团队研发出配方的，再由业内最好的营销专家把它推向市场，生产团队也深知其中的复杂和困难。从 198 年起，在全世界销售的立普妥的有效成分都在爱尔兰的科克郡生产，辉瑞在那里拥有三家巨型工厂。公司原来预计每年需要的有效成分最多 50 吨。但是药物上市短短五年后，这个数字就翻了两番，达到了每年 200 吨。

位于灵戸斯基迪的那家工厂坐落在一片 200 英亩的园区内部，每天 24 小时运营，信奉一种「品质文化」，目标是使次品数量接近于零。工人们时常接受培训，学习「保持辉瑞品质」，公司的一家工厂在墙上张贴的标语也时刻这样告诚他们。

立普妥性质不稳定，就像灵厄斯基迪那青灰色的地貌 [6]，好在工厂开发了一套万无一失的生产系统。「这种药很娇气，但我们知道怎么生产它。」在辉瑞负责生物制药生产的副总裁保罗·达菲（Paul Duffy）博士说道，「在你和一种药物打了 20 年的交道后，它就成了你的孩子，它的脾气你都了解了。」

在纽约，拥有康奈尔大学化学博土学位的律师迈尔斯怀疑，兰伯西的化学家们根本够不上立普妥的档次，这种药他们谈不上理解，也多半做不出来。想到这里，他对前方的战斗隐隐感到一丝兴奋。「我活着就是为了消灭这些人。」他后来这样描述他的仿制药对手，「我的工作就是阻止他们。」

你对兰伯西的看法取决于你的立场。迈尔斯身居辉瑞位于曼哈顿中城的总部，他的看法是：「你一开始对付兰伯西，你就堕落到业界底层的水平了。」但是在许多方面，仿制药又是一个暴发户的市场。仿制药拥有公众和政界两方面的支持，它的蓬勃发展正从底部一点点侵蚀品牌药产业的必胜信念。兰伯西申请仿制立普妥的消息甫一传出，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的一名商业记者就将其比作「典型的大卫对战歌利亚的局面一一辉瑞的营收大约是这个弱小挑战者的 50 倍」。

在 1984 年之前，全世界类似兰伯西的公司根本无法挑战辉瑞这样的巨头。当时，仿制药在美国还没有清晰的批准路径。按照美国药监局的规定，就算一种药物的专利已经过期，仿制药公司也需要重复其大规模、高成本的临床试验，虽然品牌药企早已证明了这种药物的安全性和功效。后来一个名叫威廉·F。哈达德（William I. Haddad）的记者决定改变这个局面，他是一个富有使命感的人，也很享受以弱斗强的感觉。据他一个同事的说法，哈达德「长了一个额外的器官，它不是用来分泌汗水，而是用来吸引注意的」明。精通媒体之道的他开始鼓吹仿制药。哈达德最初是田纳西州民主党参议员埃斯蒂斯·基福弗（Estes Kefauver）的助手，基福弗是参议院反托拉斯和反垄断小组委员会的会长，他一直为保护消费者权益而斗争，并与制药产业对抗。他曾对哈达德说，他怀疑辉瑞正领导着一个垄断联盟，专门控制四环素这种抗生素在拉丁美洲的价格。1963 年基福弗去世之后，哈达德在《组约先驱论坛报》上发表了一系列颇受关注的文章，揭露这个抬高药价的垄断联盟。

哈达德后来离开新闻界，成了不起眼的仿制药产业联合会会长。在少数同情者的支持下，他开始游说国会设立一套专门供美国药监局批准仿制药的特别程序。他回忆说，当时的政坛，那些品牌药公司「控制着了每一条通道」。于是他和团队在国会大厦的走廊里来回游走，努力对少数愿意倾听他们的人表达主张。

转机出现在 20 世纪 80 年代初，哈达德得到了与保守的犹他州共和党参议员欧林·哈奇（Orrin Hatch）会面的机会。他本来以为参议员哈奇会站在大型药企那边。出乎意料的是，哈奇在聆听他的陈述时十分专注，兴趣盎然。在两小时的会面中，哈达德阐明了 150 多种品牌药的专利已经过期，但是谁也无法与它们竞争，因为仿制药根本无法获得美国药监局的批准。结果就是美国人民被迫在药物上花了太多钱。「当时他像个地方检察官似的向我发问。」哈达德回忆道。

令他吃惊的是，在这次对话的短短几天之后，哈奇就打来电话说：「我觉得你可能是对的。」这位参议员找到加州的民主党众议员享利·韦克斯曼（Henry Waxman）。两人联手迫使大型药企的 CEO 达成协议，他们还起草了项法案，为美国药监局批准仿制药辟出了一条科学通道。这就是「简化新药申请」的由来。从此，仿制药公司不必再从零开始证明自家产品的安全性和功效了，因为品牌药公司早已开展过昂贵的长期临床试验。它们只要开展有限的检测，证明自家的药物和品牌药具有生物等效性，并且能在人体内起到相似的作用，美国药监局就会批准它们。

但前方还有一个大障得。在一次审议中，一名仿制药高管把哈达德拉到个角落问他：「你说，我要是起诉并且赢了官司，我能得到什么呢？」开发一种药物的仿制版需要投入前期成本，也许还要和志在保护专利的品牌药公司发生诉讼，仿制药公司既可能让投入的钱打水漂又有可能输掉官司，那还有什么能吸引他们开展这项业务呢？

办法就是所谓的「先到先得」的奖励政策。这项政策彻底改变了仿制药产业。它允许第一个向美国药监局提交仿制药申请的公司获得巨额利润：在申请获批后的六个月里，这家公司有权以接近品牌药的价格独家销售仿制药，六个月后，其他竞争者可以进入市场，促使药价大跌。抢到第一名就能发财，抢不到的就只能混口饭吃了。

1984 年，众议院以 362 票赞成、0 票反对的比例一致通过了《药价争与专利期限恢复法》，后来又被称作《哈奇一韦克斯曼法》。这虽然是仿制药生产者的巨大胜利，但它也将品牌药公司的专利期限稍稍延长了几年。当年 9 月，里根总统在白官政瑰园的一场纪念仪式上签署了法案。他称赞了低价药品的好处，并对听众说道：「在我们这个社会，老年公民比任何群体都更需要药物。对这个问题我还是有点发言权的。」听众中一片笑声。哈达德表示，《哈奇一韦克斯曼法》「使仿制药产业真正迈开了步子。它使这个产业有了根据，有了基础，仿制药公司得以成长，药价也大大降低了」。

还有一件事是一开始就摆明了的：仿制药公司能赚到大钱。据美国药监局的一名前任官员回忆，法案生效的当天，各家仿制药公司就派出「装满简化新药申请的拖车」向美国药监局驶来。「在第一个月里，我们就收到了 100 价申请。」申请的文件之多，加上首先申请能修获得的利益之巨，都突显出仿制药厂是这样一个地方一美国药监局最早的仿制药事务部门主管之马尔文·塞费（Marvin Seife）博士曾这样说：「只要把原料放进混料桶里再打开龙头，流出来的就是黄金了。」

在仿制药公司内部，先到先得的激励政策掀起了一股狂潮。曾在兰伯西担任高级副总裁、专司全球知识产权事务的杰伊·德希穆克（Jay Deshmukh）回忆说：「抢先比什么都重要。」此事的关键不是申请文件在哪一天被送到马里兰州罗克维尔市的美国药监局仿制药事务总部，而是文件送达的顺序。「就算领先一分钟也是领先。」德希穆克说。

随着竞争的加剧，等待的时间也在延长。当一种药物的专利即将过期时，人们常常能看到，仿制药公司的高管们在美国药监局停车场上的车子里过夜，以便第二天上班时第一个冲进美国药监局大门。每隔一段时间，那块停车场上就会支起一大片帐篷，那些高管会一连几周驻扎在那里。关于如何等候、如何抢先，每家公司都有自己的策略。有的出钱雇人在停车场等候。梯瓦公司在附近酒店订了房间，每晚派员工轮流守夜。

2002 年 12 月 23 日，夜空明朗清澈，两天后就是圣诞节了，美国药监局的停车场上仍挤满了人。美国药监局在几小时前就关门下班了。但是来自四家仿制药公司（兰伯西、梯瓦、迈兰和巴尔）的代表仍在排队等，他们一边跺脚，一边拍打戴着手套的双手，以此取暖。兰伯西派出了两名最可的员工，并配了一辆加长华汽车，让他们可以轮流睡觉等候。

这些人都有同一个目标：美国药监局第二天一开门就第一个冲进去。他们都是要仿制一种名为莫达非尼（Provigil）的药物，它原本由瑟法隆公司生产，作用是防止日间嗜睡。对于首先提交申请的仿制药公司，这绝对是一脉富矿。

当天空出现晨光，兰伯西的一名高管踌躇满志地以为领头的位置非自己莫属。然而当大门打开时，迈兰公司的一个年轻娇小的女子却一把将他推开，冲进大门，盖上那个众人垂涎的时间戳，抢到了第一名。

在后方的兰伯西总部，负责美国法规事务的艾哈·潘特只能安慰自己接受第二名了。他们还没有彻底输掉，因为排名第一并不是胜利的保证。美国药监局只考虑它认为「实质性完整」的申请。这是为了防止仿制药公司用不完善的申请材料占位、在抢到第一之后再认真考虑如何制药的情况。因此潘特绝没有放弃希望。排第二名也很关键。她会等待第一名失足跌倒的。美国药监局也正努力解决外面的露营问题。它在 2003 年 7 月修改了政策，规定任何仿制药公司只要在特定日期提交申请，都有可能共享六个月的独家生产权。在给仿制药产业的书面指南中，美国药监局这样写道。

在最近发生的几起事件中，有多名简化新药申请者或其代理人为率先提交专利申请，而在美国药监局外排队，甚至在旁边露营，时间从天到三周以上不等。出于责任与安全上的考虑，本物业业主决定禁止申请者在提交日之前排队。

虽然共享的独家生产权没有原来那么诱人，但首先提交申请仍是仿制药公司获得最大利润的机会。对兰伯西来说，这类申请依然对公司的战略计划至关重要，这个计划被称作「迦楼罗愿景」，迦楼罗是印度教中一只翱翔的神。为防止任何员工忘记公司的目标，公司在新泽西办公室的墙上挂了一张镶有镜框的海报，上面用大字写着「2015 战略」。海报的标题是「美国：到 2015 年实现 10 亿美元可持续盈利模式」，下面的第一条要点用粗体写着：「每年都有重大的首次提交申请项目」。公司的前任 CEO 之一达温德·辛格·布拉尔（Davinder  Singh Brar）在公司赞助的一本书中表示，这个 10 亿美元的理想「镌刻在每一位员工的内心」。

在兰伯西内部，监督首次提交申请的任务落在了杰伊·德希穆克的肩上。他是一名身材精瘦、讲话尖刻的律师，专攻知识产权。1998 年时，他还是一名在辛辛那提混日子的年轻律师。一天，他意外地在《专利与商标局协会杂志》上看到了一则广告，是兰伯西在招聘一名专利律师。他回忆说：「我还从来没见过有印度公司招聘专利律师的。」一时兴起，他递了简历。

德希穆克出生于印度，大学学的是化学工程，他对在兰伯西工作的前景很感兴趣，尤其在见过那位目光远大的总经理帕温德·辛格（Parvinder  Singh）博士之后，他觉得此人「非常聪明，又和蔼可亲」。德希穆克接下了这份工作，薪水翻了一番。他带着年轻的家人搬到了新泽西州的普林斯顿居住。虽然这看起来是一次很好的职业转变，但更重要的是，他把这份工作看成「相当于回国为印度服务」的机会。

德希穆克对印度的企业文化并不了解，他很快发现自己置身于一个「家长制气息浓厚」的环境中，在这里「上司就是你的父亲，他永远正确」。德希穆克立刻和上司产生了神突。加入公司不到一年，他就要求和帕温德开会，在会上他申请直接向 CEO 布拉尔汇报，帕温同意了。如此一来，德希穆克就巩固了他在公司未来的地位，因为一年之后，布拉尔就成为公司的总经理。也正是他鼓励了徳希穆克瞄准立普妥仿制药的。

在兰伯西内部，对立普妥的仿制绝非一般的商业项目。「这种药的利润太诱人了，就好比一个不是你妻子的美女在你面前脱光了衣服，作为男人是很难拒绝的。这怎么能拒绝呢？」德希穆克说。

2002 年 10 月 9 日，在兰伯西提交简化新药申请 76477 近两个月后，美国药监局打破了沉默，他们先是打来电话，接着又发了正式信函：美国药监局已确认兰伯西为第一个提交申请的公司，并将对公司的立普妥仿制版阿托伐他汀展开评估。

消息传来，兰伯西内部一片欢腾。当时提交申请，美国药监局的停车场还空荡荡的，因为兰伯西远远抢在了竟争对手的前面。现在兰伯西的面前出现了一条通往史上最大的仿制药大奖的道路。但巨大的障碍依然存在。首先，美国药监局的监管者们要判断申请文档中的科研是否有价值。兰伯西的检测数据必须证明，他们的仿制版立普妥能在患者的血液中释放和原版等量的有效成分，那样才能达到美国药监局的要求。在那之后，兰伯西还要挺过辉瑞派出的专利律师大军的攻击，他们已守护这种药物多年。兰伯西必须小心行事，经受住这个全世界最强势的药物市场的审查。

理论上说，所有公司都必须严格遵守良好生产规范。但是对那些重效益轻品质的公司来说，还是有许多即兴发挥的途径以及投机取巧的办法。徳希穆克坦言，「先到先得」的诱惑创造了「狂野的西部」，在这里制药公司不仅要抢先提交申请，还要不计代价地维护这些申请。为了争夺第一，保住第一，兰伯西公司做出了一个艰难的选择，那是在迪内希萨库尔来公司报到仅几个月之前的事。

2003 年 5 月，兰伯西的高管们聚集在佛罗里达州博卡拉顿一家酒店会议室里，参加一场关于基本运营的会议。主持会议的是公司的 CEO 布拉尔，他戴了一条一丝不乱的头巾。拉希米·巴布海亚，也就是那位将萨库尔招进公司的研发主管，也在会上。同样出席的还有公司总裁布赖恩·坦皮斯特（Brian Tempest）。讨论很快转向一个他们在电子邮件中反复讨论过的话题，为此还起草了一份严格保密的报告，报告的内容只有与会的人有权知道。

三个月前，公司在美国市场推出一款名为 Soret 的药物，那是罗氏公司生产的抗痤疮药 Accutane 的仿制版。Soret 是第一款面向美国患者的低价仿制药，它甫一推出就占领市场，并成为兰伯西争取 10 年内全球销售额达到 50 亿美元的一个重要步骤。

然而就在这次会议的前几天，兰伯西的高管们暂停了这种高利润药物的发售。他们告诉美国的监管机构，这种 40 毫克胶囊的溶解速度出现了「下趋势」，并表示在调查出原因之前，将从市场上召回三个批次的药物。但他们说了谎。对 Soret 的随机检测显示，配方已经失效了。根据美国药监局的规章，他们现在只有一个选择：向监管机构交代全部情况，并将 Soret 从市场上召回，然后返回实验室重新设计药物，直到它生效。

或者还有一个办法。「去把马立克给我找来！」布拉尔怒视着一众副手吼道，其中一个手忙脚乱地跑出会议室去找马立克。拉吉夫·马立克（Rai Maik）是一个头脑精明又充满热情的有机合成研究员，他在兰伯西主管配方开发和法规事务，被同事们看作仿制药世界的大魔术师胡迪尼。他的逆向工程技术无人可及，仿佛能将任何物质转变成别的物质。如果说这个难题还有规避的可能，那他就是不二人选。

但是那一天，平日里兴高采烈的马立克却神情不安地走进了会议室一一他在公司断断续续工作了 18 年。开发 Soret E 的实验室工作正是马立克领导的。现在同事们都希望他赶紧解决问题。他感觉到他们都不耐烦了。

「这不是一个可以马上解决的题。」他告诉大伙，「我的手上没有魔杖。」面对神情沮丧的同事，马立克接着回顾了他领导下的 Soret 开发的艰辛历史。虽然开展了五年多高成本的实验室研究，兰伯西的化学家们依然无法使药物恰当地溶解。作为一种悬浮状态的软凝胶产品，其粒径太难控制。

他们检测出来交给美国药监局审核的几个批次都是在受控环境中生产的，这些批次最后都产生了良好的功效，与原版药物相当。可是当他们扩大产量，准备以商业规模生产时，杂质的含量却陡然上升，药物的溶解也出了问题。马立克做了这样的猜想：软凝胶接触空气中的氧气，产生了一种影响溶解的反应。想出对策需要时间。而与此同时，他们必须停止出售药物。

「我也不知道还要多久才能让 Soret 重新上市。」他告诉一众高管他并没有重申房间里的每一个人已经知道的事实：就算完全按照配方生产，这种药物仍具有独特的危险性。美国药监局要求在这种药物的标签上写上「黑箱」警告，提醒患者在孕期服用可能导致出生缺陷或流产，或者使服用者产生自杀倾向，而许多服用者都是青少年。国会曾就这种药物的品牌版召开过一次听证会，起因是一名众议员的儿子在服药期间自杀了。为了对其进行限制，监管机构要求生产者将所有销售、过期或销毁的情况上报。它很危险，所以需要保持慎和信息透明。

鉴于这些情况，美国药监局的规章要求兰伯西的管理层从市场上召回药物并暂停生产，直到失效的问题得到解决。然而在兰伯西内部，激烈的讨论次次回到商业压力的问题上：如果公司在这件事上处理不当，就马上会有等在后面的竞争对手发布自己的版本。不继续销售就是损害利益。

马立克环顾会议桌，据他后来的说法，他看到了这些同事「不理性」的思维方式。这些围坐成一圈的高管只有两个选择：要么停止发售，这意味着放弃公司的盈利目标；要么继续发售，且不再向监管机构透露信息，这意味着危害患者并违反美国药监局的规章。

对利润的追求最终胜出。他们决定继续发售，并对监管者隐瞒问题，同也回到实验室寻求解决方案。多年以后回顾时，布拉尔说他已经不记得这次博卡拉顿会议的细节了，但他这样评论了自己在兰伯西的任期：「我在任何时候、任何场合都从未听到任何一位管理人员说过要省略开发步骤和流程，以此缩短上市时间。」他说情况正相反，「我们总是提心吊胆，生怕在美国做错任何事情。我们在公司内部就謹慎到了这种程度。

然而就在这次 Soret 会议后不久，高管们就把这款痤疮药的品质缺陷写成了文档，标题为《Soret 调查报告》。负责法规事务的副总裁艾卜哈·潘特将这份报告保存在了她位于新泽西总部的办公室里。报告的封面页上用加粗字体写着：不要交给美国药监局。

## 0103. A Slum for the Rich

AUGUST 2003

Gurgaon, India

If globalization can be said to have a headquarters, then it may well be Gurgaon, an entire city built from the outsourcing efforts of the world’s Fortune 500 companies. Gurgaon lies just eighteen miles southwest of New Delhi. Two decades ago, it was a sleepy farming town ringed by forest, nestled below the beautiful Aravalli mountain range. As global multinational companies looked to move their back-office functions to India, developers sensed opportunity. Office towers rose from the fields. Roads named Cyber City and Golf Course were built. In short order, Gurgaon became known as「Millennium City.」

Its skyline was branded by global capitalism: Accenture, Motorola, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and many others tacked their logos onto newly acquired buildings. Thousands of people and cars, as well as numerous shopping malls, followed, with the encouragement of the Haryana Urban Development Authority, which seemed to have no urban plan other than to welcome developers. Ranbaxy, too, established its research headquarters here, on an elegant, well-guarded campus.

Amid Gurgaon’s building frenzy, there were few restrictions and little in the way of infrastructure. A patchwork of after-the-fact water treatment plants, sewers, subway stations, and power lines could not keep up with the demand. Corporate residents and their well-heeled employees were left to scramble for dwindling water and electricity. They bought most of the latter privately, at exorbitant rates, using diesel generators that further fouled the already polluted air.

Donkeys and pigs wandered amid the chauffeured town cars on the clogged, potholed streets. Officials estimated that, owing in part to the numerous bore-wells drilled by private residences and businesses seeking water, the plummeting water table would be entirely depleted within two decades. India had intended Gurgaon to be a showcase of the nation’s central role in the twenty-first-century economy. Instead, the BBC suggested it was a「slum for the rich.」

Still, for corporations and their employees, it was the place to be. In the summer of 2003, the Thakurs settled into a freestanding gated house with a small guard post outside, manned overnight by a hired guard. Their very address reflected Gurgaon’s dramatic development: they lived in「Phase 1,」the first area of Gurgaon to be built. Their house had a planted lawn, white tiled floors, and gracious rooms for entertaining. Its own diesel generator kicked in when Gurgaon’s overtaxed grid blinked out. Thakur set up a home office in the basement, right next to a play area for Ishan, where the boy watched Barney and Clifford videos as Thakur worked through the weekends.

As a foreign citizen of Indian origin, Thakur was supposed to register with the local police upon his arrival. So he went to the decrepit Gurgaon police station, where the police officers looked baffled as Thakur explained that he was there to try to meet the requirements of his visa. Determined to educate them about the policies they were supposed to enforce, Thakur went home, printed out the relevant forms, and returned to explain them in more depth. His effort to comply with the law took almost a whole day.

He left the police station with a new form, filled out by hand and signed in multiple places, which he laminated to forestall ever having to return. In India, paperwork seemed to be a hedge against chaos, as well as a contributor to it.「We’ve created mountains of paper to create the assurance that if something happens tomorrow, there’s a file,」Thakur later mused.「It’s a great mechanism for justifying any action you take. It has to be in a file someplace.」

Thakur was not naive about the challenges of living in India. But he was determined not to compromise his ethical values to do so. He would remain a stickler for rules in a country where subterranean agreements, often accompanied by cash payments, governed so many interactions. As Thakur focused on his work at Ranbaxy, he remained confident that private Indian companies operated differently than the corrupt and bloated public sector. And he believed that the efficiency of corporations could help lift India into the twenty-first century.

Motorcycles, trucks, taxis, and auto-rickshaws whizzed along Gurgaon’s main thoroughfare, the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road. Fruit carts pulled by donkeys dotted the roadsides, as did stray goats and buffalo. Encampments of people by the hundreds lived on the roadside beneath fraying tarps.

Tucked along a side street, behind a guard post and sliding gate, sat the main research and development center of Ranbaxy Laboratories. The entryway was framed by impeccable shrubs and plantings. Inside the main entrance, above the gleaming tile floors, hung a portrait of the company’s former managing director Parvinder Singh, who had died four years earlier of cancer, at age fifty-six. The white-bearded Parvinder sat with hands folded beneath an opulent red drape, in a white Sikh turban with a matching handkerchief in the breast pocket of his dark suit, a serene smile on his face, as though monitoring—and blessing—the goings-on. The Indian press had dubbed Parvinder, the son of the company’s founder,「the alchemist who saw tomorrow.」Under his leadership, Ranbaxy had become a global company—the transformation that had helped create Thakur’s new job.

Thakur’s mandate, as director of research information and portfolio management, was to impose some order and transparency on the burgeoning global pipeline. He was an information architect, expected to build a scaffold for the company’s data. This newly created position made him one of the few company executives with a clear grasp of all Ranbaxy’s far-flung world markets. He threw himself into the work. He hired six people, trained them in portfolio management, and developed a complex Excel spreadsheet to map the progress of the drugs the company was making for each part of the world.

Thakur frequently stayed long after his colleagues left. Sometimes, in the evenings, the family driver, Vijay Kumar, brought Sonal and little Ishan to pick Thakur up at work. The toddler would scribble letters on the whiteboard in his father’s office or gleefully race up and down the empty hallways before the family returned home for the night.

Though Vijay had to take the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road every day by necessity, he tried to get off it as quickly as possible. Stretches were deteriorating. Traffic backed up. When it flowed, it was a free-for-all, with few traffic lights, rules posted but ignored, the actual lanes a mere suggestion that few heeded. At night the potholes, poor streetlights, and wandering buffalo made it downright dangerous.

Vijay had first met Thakur the previous summer, when the executive had come to interview at Ranbaxy. In his early twenties, he worked at a taxi company and had been assigned to drive Thakur around. Thakur had been impressed with his quiet and responsible demeanor, as well as his skill in navigating the awesome hazards of Gurgaon’s roads. When Thakur moved back to India, he hired Vijay as the family driver, a big step up for a young man who’d come from a family of subsistence farmers.

One late evening, just months into his employment, Vijay picked up Thakur at Ranbaxy, then reentered the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road. Motorcycles and trucks sped around them on the dark thoroughfare. Suddenly, vehicles ahead swerved around what looked like a pile of trash in the road. As Vijay drove closer, they saw it was a man’s motionless body.

Like most of the other drivers, Vijay had deemed it smartest and safest to ignore the man. But as other cars swerved around the body, Thakur ordered him to pull over. Vijay begged for permission to keep going, but Thakur refused. He made Vijay pull onto the shoulder and get out with him. As traffic broke around them on the shadowy road, they reached the man, who was alive but drunk and bleeding from the head. They lugged him to safety. It was a crazy rescue, one that violated every rule of safe driving—and defensive living—that most Indians knew: namely, keep your head down and your car moving, and don’t volunteer aid to strangers. No good could come of it. Such a rescue was more likely to invite any number of bad outcomes.

But for Thakur, getting the man off the road was not enough. Though he was generally a wary and reluctant observer, he had a countervailing tendency: to lean into whatever project he’d started, regardless of the possible result. He insisted to Vijay that they carry the man to a local hospital, a block and a half away.

To Vijay, lugging the man down the street was one of the stranger projects he’d ever undertaken. Why do this when they had no stake in whether the man lived or died? At the hospital, the surprised staff seemed to agree with Vijay and refused treatment unless Thakur paid in advance. He peeled off 7,000 rupees (about `$140`, a lordly sum and twice what Vijay earned in a week) and left his business card behind. He did not even think to help anonymously. To Vijay, his new boss seemed to have weird American ideas about coming to the rescue. And as the young driver correctly predicted, the outcome was bad.

The next day, a police officer showed up at Ranbaxy and accused Thakur of running the man over. Why else would Thakur have paid so much money to help him, unless he’d done something bad to him in the first place? Thakur called the Human Resources Department and directed them to deal with the situation. The officer ultimately went away, which to Thakur almost certainly meant he was paid to no longer press his inquiry.

Coming to the attention of「the system」in India had almost no upside. Altruism was often greeted with suspicion. Had Thakur not worked for a company with resources, one able to pay to make an allegation vanish, who knows where the confrontation with the police officer might have led? Companies were king in India, while people were more likely to be treated as dispensable. Though the incident left Thakur uneasy about his decision to return to India, his lingering doubts were soon erased by an extraordinary event at Ranbaxy.

On November 21, 2003, Ranbaxy’s corporate communications director, Paresh Chaudhry, watched in amazement as U.S. Secret Service officers swept rooms and posted snipers on the rooftop of Ranbaxy’s headquarters. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton was arriving that day to publicly thank Ranbaxy and two other Indian generic drug companies for agreeing to manufacture AIDS drugs that would be sold for about 38 cents a day in African and Caribbean countries. The price was roughly 75 percent less than the lowest possible cost for equivalent brand-name drugs. Although U.S. taxpayers would foot the bill, it was the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation that had closed the deal.

Chaudhry, hardworking and innovative, had never in his wildest dreams imagined that he’d be running logistics for an event involving a former U.S. president, let alone Bill Clinton, who was particularly beloved by Indians. When Clinton had visited India in late March 2000, he became the first U.S. president to do so in more than twenty-two years. On that visit, he’d emphasized the need for the two countries to cooperate in tackling diseases such as AIDS.

Clinton’s passion for the country was more than pro forma. He’d returned in April 2001, three months after a devastating earthquake in Gujarat killed 20,000 people. Through the American India Foundation, which he was chairing, Clinton raised millions to resurrect devastated villages. He declared to adoring throngs,「I intend to come back to India for the rest of my life.」

He was back now, the third time in four years, making good on his pledge to unite India and America in the fight against AIDS. For almost two weeks straight, Chaudhry had been immersed in preparations, his world becoming a blur of Secret Service agents, lists of names, badges for employees who would be there, what food would be served, which route Clinton would take, and who was going to receive him. The visit was a potential marketing bonanza. As Chaudhry well knew, he could work his whole career and never have a chance like this again.

For years, he had invited international journalists to visit Ranbaxy. He’d shown them the company’s research facilities and modern manufacturing plants. He’d explained the robust efforts to develop new chemical entities. But the response was generally the same:「Thank you very much. We’ll come back to you if we’re interested in something.」And then silence.

As Chaudhry knew, he was up against the widespread assumption that low cost equals low quality. Indian generic drug makers—who, by and large, invented little but rather reengineered existing brand-name drugs—were viewed around the world as fakers and copycats. Even in Africa, their drugs were held in low esteem. In Cameroon, doctors referred to their products as pipi de chats—cat urine. Things had begun to shift in their favor in 2001, during the U.S. anthrax scare following the attacks of September 11. Bayer had proposed to sell the U.S. government ciprofloxacin—an antibiotic that was one of the few remedies for anthrax poisoning—at almost two dollars a pill. Ranbaxy’s price was one-fifth that.「Bayer and the lobbyists in the U.S. and Washington tried their best to say that this is a fake company,」Chaudhry recalled. But patents blocked the U.S. government from purchasing Ranbaxy’s version. Today’s event, Chaudhry hoped, would finally be the game-changer.

As Clinton walked through the sliding doors in a dark suit and deep red tie, Chaudhry was among the first to extend a hand in welcome. The others in the vestibule, all in their best suits, canted forward, anxiety and excitement etched into every face as they stood ready to anticipate the former president’s wishes.

Eager employees gathered in the auditorium to listen, along with many members of the media whom Chaudhry had been chasing for so long. Thakur got a front-row seat. Clinton stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ranbaxy’s CEO, D. S. Brar, who wore a black turban, dark suit, and patterned tie against a crisp white shirt. He had been appointed Ranbaxy’s CEO after Parvinder Singh’s death and was hailed as a professional manager, his appointment viewed as a milestone for the family-owned company.

Clinton explained that he had come to thank the Indian companies—including Ranbaxy, Cipla, and Matrix Laboratories—for agreeing to make such low-cost drugs.「It’s very important to give these companies some credit here, because they have basically believed in us,」he told those assembled. Their efforts, he added, ensured「that we can go out and work with other countries and convince them that treatment was a viable option and an affordable option.」

Brar then had his turn.「The drugs can be priced at a lower price only if there are volumes, and for that the large AIDS-inflicted nations have to come forward and purchase in bulk. This was not happening till the Clinton Foundation stepped into the picture and brought together the nations and the producers of the drugs.」

After the speech, as Clinton pressed into the crowd, Thakur got a turn to shake his hand.

The visit was everything Chaudhry had hoped for, and more. From that moment, the company’s sales increased and its reputation improved.「We arrived as a company,」Chaudhry recalled. Ranbaxy was poised to surge in Western markets.「We can kill these big guys in the U.S. with all our products,」Chaudhry summed up the feeling.「It’s good for humanity. It’s good for the government. It’s good for the people. Why should anyone block us, for heaven’s sake?」

Clinton’s visit was a boost for the entire industry. Before it, governments around the world had faced aging populations, the AIDS epidemic, and soaring drug prices. How could they afford to treat these patients? Clinton had shown them a solution. India’s drug companies, it appeared, were on the side of the angels. As Ranbaxy’s next managing director, Dr. Brian Tempest, later told the Guardian:「We don’t make a lot of money out of selling AIDS treatments cheaply. . . . This is really out of social responsibility, because we are based in the developing world and have all its issues on our doorstep.」

Whether the companies could profit by selling vastly discounted AIDS drugs or not, Clinton had vouched for Indian generics. His visit led to new opportunities and potential profits all over the world. On a later trip, Clinton went to Cipla’s facility in Goa, where he planted a pine tree in the gardens, a tradition for important visitors started by the company’s legendary chairman, Yusuf Hamied. For companies that had no fancy lobbyists in Washington, D.C., the visits proved invaluable.「Our humanitarian effort has been our public relations,」Hamied later explained.「Every door is open now.」

After his stop at Ranbaxy, President Clinton used the same visit to head to Agra to see the Taj Mahal, the white marble mausoleum built in the seventeenth century by a Mughal emperor for his wife. There, Clinton followed visitor protocol and took an electric bus from the outskirts of the monument to its gates, a requirement that protected the World Heritage site from air pollution. But on the return to his hotel, the electric bus stalled, and the former president had to walk the rest of the distance. In a country that prided itself on spectacular ceremony and magnificent hospitality, the lapse risked becoming an international embarrassment—suggesting that the nation’s old, broken-down infrastructure still lurked beneath the gleaming facade.

## 0104. The Language of Quality

FEBRUARY 25, 2000

New Iberia, Louisiana

Jose Hernandez sniffed the air. The forty-three-year-old FDA investigator stepped deeper into the K&K Seafoods crab-processing plant, which looked none too appetizing. His mind clicked over the regulations enshrined in the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Gazing inside the plant, he could practically see the relevant pages: the fish and fishery products「Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point」plan, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, part 123, 6 (b).

But his nose signaled the most trouble. What was that odor? It reminded him of his Labrador, Livy, after a bath—that sodden, damp-wool smell of a dog soaked to the skin. Not a good sign in a seafood facility that was supposed to be operating under good manufacturing practices. He doubted the plant was safe for consumers.

Hernandez, balding with a dark mustache, glasses, and a runner’s physique, was the FDA’s resident-in-charge of the Lafayette, Louisiana, office, a four-man outpost. His job, as a badge-carrying FDA investigator, was to inspect the seafood manufacturing plants and small medical centers in the area. Hernandez got paid `$45,000` a year, a salary on which he was supporting his wife and four children. The agency had no laptops, so Hernandez took handwritten notes while inspecting, then signed up for time to use the single desktop computer at the office to type them up. He wore coveralls and plastic boots while inspecting seafood plants.

It would not be everyone’s choice of jobs, but Hernandez thrived in it, and he’d begun to earn a reputation as one of the FDA’s smarter, more intuitive, and more energetic investigators. He lived in a rambling 5,000-square-foot house, which he was painstakingly renovating. He’d learned expert carpentry skills from his grandfather, who’d helped raise him in Puerto Rico. Hernandez graduated from the Inter American University in San Juan and began at the FDA as a generalist investigator in 1987. Though he didn’t have fancy graduate degrees, he had a mechanical mind. He knew how things were supposed to fit together and could tell when they didn’t. He could readily organize facts and remember them. He also had an uncanny sense for when something was wrong.

To relax, Hernandez worked on his house and, whenever possible, took his kids camping. But his mind was never at rest. It ranged continually over Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. He knew the regulations almost encyclopedically, but also kept them close at hand to reread. They were his scripture.「The guy preaching the Mass for thirty years always goes back [to the Book],」he said.「I never tried to answer from memory. I never tried to guess. You can never charge anybody with anything unless there’s a regulation.」

He mulled over patterns—the visible workflow in a plant versus the invisible machinations, the relationship between what he saw and what the regulations stipulated. During everyday activities, like drinking water from a plastic bottle, he’d recite the regulations to himself: 21 CFR165.110 was for bottled water. The container holding the water was regulated differently than the water itself (21 CFR1250.40). To him, the inspections were puzzles, and he was always trying to find the missing pieces.

Under FDA regulations, he only had to show his badge and any manufacturing facility regulated by his agency had to allow him full access to the plant and grounds. He never gave advance notice—none was required. Refusal to admit an FDA investigator could lead to a plant being shut down. He would stay as long as he felt was needed for a thorough review. That could mean one day or two weeks. He began each inspection by driving around the perimeter, taking in the broadest view. He thought of it as first looking through the wide lens of a camera. He could then zero in on the important stuff. When it came to K&K Seafoods, he knew exactly what to do. He needed to return when least expected, and presumably least wanted. Nighttime was when they cooked the crabs.「If you want to build a case,」he said,「you have to be there when things are happening.」

He went home for dinner. Once the kids were asleep, he returned to the plant at 9:00 p.m., and an unhappy-looking employee let him in. This time the wet-dog smell was even stronger. Hernandez followed it to the back of the plant, where he found a small kitchen and a pan on the stove with pieces of meat in it—dog meat. He headed out to the plant floor, where a man cooking the live crabs was chewing as he worked. He’d caught the employee red-handed, though the violation itself, 21 CFR110.10 (b)(8), was rather understated: no eating allowed in areas where food is being processed.

The FDA’s regulations were narrow and specific. It made no difference whether the man was chewing a cracker or a dog haunch. What Hernandez thought about it made no difference either. He couldn’t impose deeper sanctions for something particularly repulsive.

On the face of it, the K&K crabmeat plant was a noisome place that might have raised anyone’s suspicions. But Hernandez had a gift not just for aggressively following up obvious clues but for seeing beneath the surface of even pristine-looking manufacturing plants. He’d proven this during his inspection at the Sherman Pharmaceuticals plant in Abita Springs, Louisiana, which made eye lubricants for contact lenses and prescription eye solutions. In 1994, he’d arrived, with two trainees, seven months after the plant had emerged unblemished from an inspection.

His domain was plant and grounds. So as usual, Hernandez began with the grounds, working his way from the outside in. He wandered into the woods ringing the plant. In the distance he noticed a smoldering pile, as though for a barbecue. He directed one of the trainees to find a stick and poke around in the embers. They uncovered a pile of charred medicine that the company was burning. But why? The investigators were able to spot lot numbers on the partially burned containers. The medicine, as it turned out, had not yet expired.「You’re not going to destroy product that is actually sound, so what happened to the rest?」Hernandez wondered. As it turned out, the company was burning medicine that had been returned because of contamination. Instead of investigating the cause and reporting it to the FDA, as required, the company chose to try to destroy the evidence. Hernandez detailed his findings in an inspection form called a 483.

The FDA’s investigators codify their findings in three ways: No Action Indicated (NAI) means that the plant passes muster; Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) means that the plant is expected to correct deficiencies; and Official Action Indicated (OAI), the most serious designation, means that the plant has committed major violations and must take corrective actions or face penalties. Under Hernandez’s watchful eye, both K&K and Sherman Pharmaceuticals received an OAI, putting them at risk of even greater sanctions.

In 1995, the FDA imposed on Sherman Pharmaceuticals its most stringent penalty, a so-called Application Integrity Policy (AIP)—one of only about a dozen such restrictions imposed by the FDA. This placed the plant under strict monitoring and required it to prove that it was not committing fraud. Sherman Pharmaceuticals went out of business shortly afterward. Hernandez never felt any sympathy toward the company—or any other, for that matter. It was not his job to take things lightly or to look the other way.

The Food and Drug Administration serves one of the most important functions of any government agency. Its job is to safeguard public health by ensuring that our food, drugs, medical devices, pet food, and veterinary supplies are safe for consumption and use. In doing this, the FDA regulates about one-fifth of the U.S. economy—essentially, most of the products Americans are exposed to and consume. It operates from a sprawling headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and has a workforce of over 17,000 employees, twenty satellite offices around the country, and seven offices overseas.

Whatever one may think of regulators—heroic public servants or pests with clipboards counting the number of times workers wash their hands—there is no doubt that in the world’s estimation, the FDA is viewed as the gold standard. If you hold its regulators up against those from most other countries, it’s like comparing「the latest model Boeing to an old bicycle,」said a senior health specialist for the World Bank.

Part of the FDA’s vaunted reputation comes from its approach. It does not just regulate with a checklist or scrutinize the final product. Instead, it employs a complex, risk-based system and scrutinizes the manufacturing process. Under FDA standards, if the process is compromised, the product is considered compromised too.

The FDA requires companies to investigate themselves under a review system called Corrective Action and Preventive Action. The drug company Merck was famous for doing this and discarding drug batches if it had the slightest concern about their quality.「You have to look to know the truth, and you have to have people who know how to look,」a former FDA investigator explained.「[And] unless agencies start looking, companies don’t look.」

Inspector Hernandez’s methods might seem simple: sniffing, looking, poking with a stick. But he was armed with concepts and regulations that had evolved over more than a century, related to both drug and food safety, which developed in sync. Today a manufacturing plant must disclose and investigate quality problems, rather than simply burn bad drugs in the woods. Workers can’t eat dog meat (or anything else, for that matter) as they work on canning crab, since a manufacturing plant must control its environment against contaminants. The concepts of control, transparency, and consistency fall under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), the elaborate architecture of regulations that govern the processing of food and the manufacturing of medicine.

Such regulations did not exist at the dawn of the twentieth century. The phrase「good manufacturing practices,」now ubiquitous in facilities around the world, made its debut in a 1962 amendment to the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For today’s drug manufacturers, cGMP is understood to be the minimum requirements a manufacturer must follow to ensure that each dose of a drug is identical, safe, and effective and contains what its packaging says it does. Those requirements evolved after a centuries-long debate over how to best guarantee the safety of food and drugs.

The medicine men of the Middle Ages were among the first to promote the idea that the quality of a drug depends on how it’s made. In 1025, the Persian philosopher Ibn Sina penned an encyclopedia called the Canon of Medicine in which he laid out seven rules for testing new concoctions. He warned experimenters that changing the condition of a substance—heating honey, say, or storing your St. John’s wort next to rat poison—could change the effect of a treatment.

Medieval rulers recognized the perils of inconsistency and the temptation for food and drug sellers to cheat their customers by replacing edible or healing ingredients with poor substitutes. In the mid-thirteenth century, an English law known as the Assize of Bread prohibited bakers from cutting their products with inedible fillers such as sawdust and hemp. In the sixteenth century, cities throughout Europe began publishing standardized recipes for drugs, known as pharmacopoeias. In 1820, eleven American doctors met in Washington, D.C., to write the first national pharmacopoeia, which, according to its preface, was meant to rid the country of the「evil of irregularity and uncertainty in the preparation of medicine.」

The same year, a German chemist named Frederick Accum published a controversial book with a mouthful of a title: A Treatise on Adulterations of Food, and Culinary Poisons. Exhibiting the Fraudulent Sophistications of Bread, Beer, Wine, Spirituous Liquors, Tea, Coffee, Cream, Confectionery, Vinegar, Mustard, Pepper, Cheese, Olive Oil, Pickles, and Other Articles Employed in the Domestic Economy. And Methods of Detecting Them. Accum railed against factories’ use of preservatives and other additives in packaged foods, such as olive oil laced with lead and beer spiked with opium. Widely read throughout Europe and the United States, Accum’s treatise brought the issue of food safety and the need for oversight to the public’s attention. In the United States, it wasn’t until 1862 that a small government office, the Division of Chemistry, began investigating food adulteration, with a staff housed in the basement of the Department of Agriculture—a fledgling effort that would later morph into the FDA.

In 1883, a square-jawed, meticulous doctor from the Indiana frontier, Harvey Wiley, took over the division. At thirty-seven, Wiley was known as the「Crusading Chemist」for his single-minded pursuit of food safety. He rallied Congress, without success, to introduce a series of anti-adulteration bills in the 1880s and ’90s. By 1902, his patience worn out, Wiley recruited twelve healthy young men and fed them common food preservatives such as borax, formaldehyde, and salicylic, sulfurous, and benzoic acids. The diners clutched their stomachs and retched in their chairs. The extraordinary experiment became a national sensation. Wiley called it the「hygienic table trials,」while the press named it the「Poison Squad.」Outrage fueled the movement for improved food quality.

Meanwhile, officials at the Laboratory of Hygiene of the Marine Hospital Service (later the National Institutes of Health) grappled with a different public health crisis. In 1901, an epidemic of diphtheria—a sometimes fatal bacterial disease—broke out in St. Louis. The disease was cured by injecting victims with an antitoxin serum, which was produced in the blood of horses. That October, a five-year-old patient who had gotten a shot of the antitoxin began to show strange symptoms: her face and throat contorted in painful spasms, and within weeks she was dead. The antitoxin intended to cure her diphtheria had actually given her tetanus. Officials traced the contamination to a retired milk-wagon horse named Jim, who had come down with tetanus some weeks before.

Though the St. Louis Health Department learned that the horse was sick in early October and consequently shot him, department officials had bled Jim twice before his death—in August and in late September. The August blood was clean, but there wasn’t enough blood to fill all of the vials. The officials topped off the remaining vials with the September batch, but failed to update the labels. As a result, some bottles marked「August」contained September’s tetanus-tainted blood, which killed thirteen children.

In response, Congress passed the Biologics Control Act in 1902, also known as the「Virus-Toxin Law.」It required producers to follow strict labeling standards and to hire scientists to supervise their operations. The law also authorized the Laboratory of Hygiene to regulate the biologics industry through inspections.

By then, journalists had begun exposing troubling practices in the food and drug industries. In 1905, an eleven-part series in Colliers’ Weekly,「The Great American Fraud,」shocked Americans by exposing「cough remedies,」「soothing syrups,」and「catarrhal powders」as being worthless and deadly. In June 1906, Congress finally passed the legislation that the chemist Harvey Wiley had spent decades lobbying for. The Food and Drug Act, or「Wiley Act,」banned dangerous additives in foods and prohibited manufacturers from making「false or misleading」statements and from selling misbranded and adulterated drugs. Additionally, medicines sold under a name listed in the United States Pharmacopoeia had to meet the published standards of strength, quality, and purity. As impressive as the law was for its time, it was marred by loopholes. It allowed harmful substances such as morphine in products, so long as they were disclosed on the label. And although the law made fraudulent claims a crime, it fell on the government to prove that a salesman intended to deceive his customers. Swindlers easily avoided prosecution by insisting that they believed in their fake remedies.

The FDA formally began in 1930. In 1933, its officials created an exhibition of hazardous food and medical products, which they displayed to Congress and at public events. The collection included an eyelash dye that blinded women, a topical hair remover with rat poison in it that caused paralysis, and a radium-based tonic called Radithor that was said to restore one’s sex drive but in reality caused deadly radium poisoning. The press called the exhibit「The American Chamber of Horrors.」

Several years later, Congress proposed a new food and drug act, but only after another tragedy nudged the bill into law. In 1937, 107 people, many of them children, died from taking a liquid antibiotic called Elixir Sulfanilamide. They died excruciating deaths. One grieving mother wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt of her daughter’s painful end:「We can see her little body tossing to and fro and hear that little voice screaming with pain. It is my plea that you will take steps to prevent such sales of drugs that will take little lives and leave such suffering behind and such a bleak outlook on the future as I have tonight.」

Sulfanilamide effectively treated streptococcal infections. Since its discovery in 1932, doctors had administered the drug in tablets and powders. But in 1937, a chief pharmacist at S. E. Massengill Company came up with a formula for a children’s syrup that called for dissolving the drug in diethylene glycol—a sweet and, as it turned out, deadly poison that would be used decades later as an ingredient in antifreeze. When FDA agents investigated Massengill’s plant, they were amazed to find that「the so-called ‘control’ laboratory merely checked the ‘elixir’ for appearance, flavor, and fragrance,」but not for toxicity. As one FDA agent reported,「Apparently, they just throw drugs together, and if they don’t explode they are placed on sale.」Spooked by the disaster, Congress finally passed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which authorized the secretary of agriculture to approve new drugs before they could be marketed. A company hoping to sell its concoction had to submit an application that described the drug’s ingredients and production process, as well as submit safety studies to convince the secretary that its manufacturing methods, facilities, and controls were adequate.

But what could be deemed「adequate」? That question came into sharp relief between December 1940 and March 1941, when nearly three hundred people fell into comas or died from taking antibiotic sulfathiazole tablets, made by the Winthrop Chemical Company in New York. On its FDA application, Winthrop claimed to have「adequate」controls. But a batch had been contaminated with as much as triple the typical dose of Luminal, a barbiturate antiseizure drug. Patients who swallowed the tainted antibiotics unknowingly overdosed on the barbiturate. In its investigation, the FDA learned that the company assembled the antibiotics and the barbiturates in the same room and often swapped the tableting machines. The company couldn’t account for what came out of its tableting machines—because it had little idea what went into them.

In the wake of the crisis, FDA officials met with an industry consultant who told them that most drug makers in the United States lacked adequate controls, in part because there was no agreement on what a good control system should be. The FDA’s drug chief wrote a memo to his division, arguing that, going forward,「the mere perfunctory statement that adequate controls are employed will not be sufficient.」

But it was the specter of an averted tragedy that had the most profound effect. In 1960, the Cincinnati manufacturer William S. Merrell applied to the FDA to sell a drug called Kevadon, widely known as thalidomide. Introduced in Germany in 1956, thalidomide was being marketed to pregnant women throughout Europe, Canada, and South America as a sleeping pill and to treat morning sickness. In the United States, the Merrell company had begun to distribute samples to doctors, but the drug was not yet commercially available. Frances Kelsey, an FDA medical officer, was assigned to review the application. She could have rubber-stamped it, but the company’s limited safety studies gave her pause. She questioned company officials about how the drug worked in the body, but they refused to answer. Instead, they complained to her superiors and pressured her to approve the drug. Kelsey refused.

By the winter of 1961, it was clear that she’d made the right decision. A growing number of physicians abroad were linking thalidomide to babies born with severely deformed limbs, such as shrunken legs and flipper-like arms. More than ten thousand mothers who had taken the drug gave birth to disabled children. Kelsey was hailed as a hero. Because of her refusal to capitulate, American patients were spared the worst, with only seventeen cases of birth defects linked to the samples. The near-miss once again galvanized Congress, and in 1962 it passed an update to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act known as the Kefauver-Harris Amendment, which required applicants to prove that their drugs were not only safe but effective, disclose potential side effects on the package, and report adverse events to the FDA. Most significant, the amendment redefined what it meant for a drug to be adulterated. Products made in plants where the process didn’t conform to「current good manufacturing practices」were deemed tainted.

That was a seismic shift. The manufacturing process became the key to quality, as it is today. This new definition gave the FDA the power to enforce good manufacturing standards. But the question remained: what should they be?

In late 1962, a group of FDA investigators met to hash out a first draft of these practices. The new regulations, published the following year, established new categories for standards in the「processing, packing, and holding of drugs.」Each「critical step」of the manufacturing process had to be「performed by a competent and responsible individual.」Workers were required to keep a detailed「batch-production record」for each drug lot, which included a copy of the master formula and documentation of each manufacturing step. As the new regulations rolled out, manufacturers struggled to comply. Drug recalls rose.

In 1966, the agency undertook a major survey of the most clinically important and popular drugs on the U.S. market. Of 4,600 samples tested, 8 percent were either more or less potent than they were supposed to be. The FDA decided that the best way to get manufacturers up to speed was through rigorous inspections. In 1968, the agency launched an intensive three-year blitz. Investigators showed up unannounced and camped out at scores of companies, sometimes for as long as a year. They badgered. They educated. They collaborated. They bullied. If a manufacturer couldn’t—or wouldn’t—comply with investigators’ demands, they were put out of business. The effort effectively launched the FDA’s modern-day inspection program.

In the decades-long journey to improve quality, the pivotal shift was from product to process. No longer could drug makers simply wait until after a drug was made to test for passing results, a hallmark of bad manufacturing. Perhaps at the end, you could test a few pills from a batch, but a million pills? That was impossible. Quality had to be built into the process, by documenting and testing each result along the way.

This practice, known as「process validation,」gained currency in the late 1980s. The data from each manufacturing step became the essential road map. The acronym ALCOA stipulated that data had to be「attributable, legible, contemporaneously recorded, original or a true copy, and accurate.」

As Kevin Kolar, formerly Mylan’s vice president of technical support, explained, a finished drug cannot be separated from the data created in the process of making it.「One without the other is not a product. . . . If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen. Meticulous attention to detail. That’s your business, your entire business.」

As the years passed, it became evident that Jose Hernandez, in Louisiana, was destined for something more complex than dog-meat detection. By the year 2000, manufacturing began to move offshore. Over the next eight years, the number of drug products made overseas for the U.S. market doubled. By 2005, for the first time, foreign manufacturing sites regulated by the FDA exceeded those in the United States.

The FDA was growing desperate for investigators willing to travel overseas. Hernandez volunteered and began doing inspections in Japan, Austria, Germany, India, and China, in quick succession. By 2003, he had joined the overseas inspectorate, a small cadre based in the United States but dedicated to visiting foreign plants. The work was exhausting and difficult. He kept his green government-issued notebook by his bedside, jotting down observations even as they came to him in half-sleep. He had little respect for his supervisors, whom he found to be more concerned with office politics than public health. His sense of commitment to the American consumer kept him energized.

The FDA knew that the best way to keep drug plants compliant was for investigators to show up unannounced, when they were least expected and wanted. So long as a drug plant remained fearful of a surprise visit, it would be more likely to follow good manufacturing practices. But the dynamic of the inspections in the international realm was completely different. No longer could Hernandez simply walk in, show his badge, and conduct an inspection. Instead, the FDA notified foreign plants of upcoming inspections months in advance. The plants then issued a formal invitation, which the FDA’s investigators used to secure travel visas. This system of advance notice was not legally required, nor was it the best way to run an inspection. But as the FDA scrambled to deal with a growing backlog of foreign inspections, advance notice became the jury-rigged solution to a host of challenges. It helped to ensure that the right employees from the plant were available during an inspection and served as a diplomatic gesture to foreign governments. Under this system, however, the foreign inspections were not a candid assessment of a plant’s true condition, but more of a staged event.

The plants coordinated the investigators’ trips and arranged their local travel.「The element of surprise is out the door,」said Hernandez. This made him even more reliant on his instincts and on everything he’d learned over the years. As he found himself in remote countries with languages he did not understand, he kept returning to the idea of「plant and grounds.」It became a kind of mantra. To him, it meant a「broad scope of thinking.」

In this way, he came to believe that—despite the different languages, the different cultures, the different time zones—quality was a language all to itself. And he was certainly fluent in that. Facilities either had controls or they didn’t, and he could look, sniff, or poke to figure it out. For example, he often couldn’t read what was written in the records themselves. Instead, he studied the way the records looked. Were they smudge-free or were there fingerprints on the copier? Was one equivalent batch of records smaller than the other? Were records creased or frayed, and if not, why not? In this way, he discovered things that some of his colleagues missed. In one instance, an overseas drug company printed records on a heavy fiber paper. He discovered that the director of quality was having staff alter data by scraping words off the page with a sharp blade. In another instance, he inspected a Chinese factory. Before entering the sterile manufacturing area, managers there requested that he wash his hands with soap and then don a double set of gloves, which everyone there was required to do before entering. I am watching the show, he thought as they went inside. He then said to the manager,「If everyone has to put on double gloves, how come there are fingerprints on the doorknob inside?」

These clues were all pieces in the massive jigsaw puzzle of a manufacturing plant. But the puzzle now stretched across continents.

Globalization cast a shadow over a process that required transparency, making distance the biggest challenge to everything the FDA had learned about safety over the last 170 years. Dr. Patrick Lukulay, former vice president of global health impact programs at the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), explained:「The issue of globalization, that’s the issue of countries where you are not [there]. . . . You almost have to be on your toes, doing unannounced inspections, listening to whistleblowers. Regulation,」he asserted,「is a cat-and-mouse business.」

## 0105. Red Flags

2004

Gurgaon

Haryana, India

Bristol-Myers Squibb had been a staid, legalistic environment. Every employee at every level was expected to attend workshops on topics ranging from how to maintain proper audit trails to matters of gender sensitivity.

At Ranbaxy, Thakur encountered chaos. The company was bristling with ambition and big ideas but had a seat-of-the-pants feel. The vice president of clinical research chain-smoked four packs a day. At Ranbaxy’s New Jersey manufacturing plant, sensitive pharmaceutical ingredients wound up in the employee refrigerator next to the half-and-half. Disputes at executive meetings sometimes escalated into fistfights. Thakur assumed that the freewheeling environment was the result of an aggressive company expanding too fast:「There was no structure. It was completely the antithesis of everything I’d learned for ten or twelve years.」

But as 2003 drew to a close, rather than be discouraged by the disorder and lack of training, Thakur took it as a sign that he was very much needed. His plan was to collect and archive all the company’s data. Moving from paper-based chaos to digitized order was part of the larger shift from an insular India-centric company to an outward-looking multinational corporation with accepted norms of record-keeping.

His team began to standardize the most basic things, down to the templates and fonts used for company presentations. They worked with a sense of mission, full of insight and new ideas in the service of transforming Ranbaxy.「Coming in, you are going to change the world,」said Venkat Swaminathan, who had come with Thakur from Bristol-Myers Squibb.「You are going to do things differently.」He even saw an upside to the chaos: the group would not「have to worry about approvals for this, and approvals for that,」as they had at BMS. They could simply move ahead with their plans.

But the chaos was impeding progress. Ranbaxy had no company-wide system for managing its drug portfolio. Different divisions did not communicate with one another. There was no way to track data. Different divisions even presented earnings variously in Euros, dollars, and rupees. Most of the company’s record-keeping was paper-based. Through a survey, Thakur learned that more than half the time scientists couldn’t even find the documents they’d created a year earlier. His team computerized and standardized systems, allowing scientists to access and store key documents, such as standard operating procedures and study reports.

One of Thakur’s early efforts was to digitize the records from the company’s clinical trials, including forms for informed consent, patient medical records, and lab results. He sent Dinesh Kasthuril to Majeedia Hospital, where Ranbaxy ran a unit that conducted clinical trials. The visit was tense. Afterward, Thakur got a call from the unit’s director, explaining that the connectivity at the hospital unit was poor, so the records would be impossible to digitize. Thakur assured him that they would put in a new link between the hospital and Ranbaxy’s data center. Thakur sent another member of his team back. This time they weren’t even allowed to enter the facility.

To Thakur, the most logical explanation for this behavior was that he’d entered a hierarchical old-boys’ network, whose long-term staff felt usurped. Not only was he new to the company, but he had come from the world of branded drugs. He figured his new colleagues might be on the lookout for a superior attitude. Thakur resolved to move slowly and politely, so he would not be accused of pushing them around—a point echoed in a management review that he’d undergone not long after he arrived at Ranbaxy.

The finished report noted Thakur’s self-confidence, self-reliance, and high expectations of others, as well as his emotional control under pressure. But it also noted his「desire to make things happen and implement the result of his analysis with a degree of pace and sense of urgency.」The evaluation continued:「He recognises that Ranbaxy is a different culture and that his desire to be direct and open does not always achieve the result that he is looking for. Further to this, his high expectations are not always fulfilled which can cause him to demonstrate a lack of patience with people.」

His attitude was not the only problem. Thakur was put on a committee tasked with developing a corporate records retention policy. After a few meetings, the company’s chief information officer notified the committee that a decision had been made to delete email records after two years. Thakur spoke up forcefully against the plan. Most research and development projects could span up to a decade, he pointed out in an email. Prematurely deleting records could cause the company to lose critical work product and fall afoul of regulators.

A few days later, he got a call from the information officer, directing him to delete his response and any records from the meetings he’d had on the topic. This was a direct instruction from the CEO’s office, the executive told him. The effort to formulate a better records retention policy sputtered out with the instruction to delete all records of the debate.

For Thakur and his team, navigating the company—and Indian corporate life—had a Through the Looking-Glass feel as they encountered obstacles that ranged from troubling to absurd. The men wanted to buy a software program called Documentum, an electronic document management system. In their view, there was nothing comparable on the market. When they took their plan for approval to the purchasing committee, they were told,「We need three quotations.」

「But there’s only one such program,」they tried to explain. Nope.

「We need three,」came the response. The purchasing committee urged them to「just get some local guys to show up.」

In another instance, Kasthuril held a meeting with the formulation team directors to discuss how to digitize lab work. The group murmured some objections until one of the directors piped up with a question:「If we do this, how do we backdate documents?」The vice president of formulation jumped in to explain that the man was asking a hypothetical question. Whether hypothetical or not, there was clearly opposition to systems that created transparency. But Thakur’s team set aside their concerns and pressed ahead. They were there, after all, to improve the company and its systems.

In January 2004, turmoil inside the company broke out into the open. Ranbaxy CEO D. S. Brar announced that he was stepping down, having lost a power struggle with the company’s heir apparent, the founder’s son, Malvinder Singh. Dr. Brian Tempest, an Englishman and chemist with tousled graying hair and a rumpled appearance, was promoted to CEO. His ascent was viewed as keeping the seat warm for Malvinder, who at thirty-two-years old was promoted to president of pharmaceuticals. To many, it seemed like a loss for professional management and a win for a「dynastic family concern run on one or two people’s fancy,」as Swaminathan saw it. The news did not bode well for the vision, held by Thakur and his allies, of Ranbaxy as an Indian Pfizer of the twenty-first century.

A bigger shock was yet to come. At a celebration of the Hindu festival of Holi, held outside on the company campus, employees and their families ate from food trucks and listened to live music. Thakur was standing in the crowd when he noticed his boss, Rashmi Barbhaiya, beckoning to him. Once the two men reached a quiet spot, Barbhaiya said,「I am leaving Ranbaxy.」Thakur was stunned. Barbhaiya had been with the company for less than two years. It was Barbhaiya who had created Thakur’s job and defended his innovations internally. On his assurance, Thakur had left a good-paying job and a settled life in the United States. Now Rashmi was leaving?「What will I do?」Thakur asked.

「You will survive, and I am not leaving just yet,」Barbhaiya said.「I will be around for a few more months and we can talk.」In the ensuing months, his mentor became furiously negative about the company. The older man told Thakur that Ranbaxy wasn’t the type of place where somebody like him should work. Over dinner at an elegant hotel with a group of American scientists who had come to help with training, Barbhaiya bad-mouthed the company, making those at the table uncomfortable. Thakur felt baffled by his animosity.

Afterward, Thakur took him aside and asked him to explain his fury. Barbhaiya remained elusive but suggested that he knew of enough「shenanigans」that could bring down the company.

Months later, Thakur went to lunch at Barbhaiya’s home. At the table, Thakur broached the topic again.

「Dinesh, I was trying to change the tires on a car running at sixty miles an hour,」his mentor replied. Thakur asked him to elaborate. Barbhaiya brought up the budget projections for 2004. Thakur recalled those quite clearly, as he had compiled the data across departments for each regional portfolio.「Did the math make any sense to you?」Barbhaiya asked.

Thakur thought back to the number of products in development—around 150. As Barbhaiya explained, in the United States it could cost a minimum of `$3` million to develop each generic drug. The cost in India could be about half of that, since labor was so much cheaper. Ranbaxy’s development budget to support that should have been around `$225` million, but it was closer to $100 million instead, as Thakur recalled. The company was dramatically shortchanging its own work.

Thakur filed the information away and the conversation moved on. But the whole experience of Barbhaiya’s departure made Thakur uneasy. Without a high-level ally, his own future at Ranbaxy looked grim.

In July 2004, Thakur’s hopes soared when he met his new boss, Dr. Rajinder Kumar. Tall and handsome with elegant manners, Kumar had an open and warm disposition, a reputation for integrity, and a thoroughly blue-chip background. He had arrived from London, where he’d served as GlaxoSmithKline’s global head of psychiatry-clinical research and development.

Kumar had completed his medical training in Scotland at the University of Dundee, then specialized in psychiatry at the Royal College of Surgeons. He went on to join SmithKline Beecham and became vice president and director for clinical development and medical affairs in neurosciences. There, he helped to develop Paxil, a blockbuster antidepressant. He was compassionate, oriented toward patients, and rigorous in his approach to good manufacturing practices.

Unlike the glowering Barbhaiya, who stayed in his office with the shades pulled down, Kumar kept his office door open. He frequently strolled around to meet subordinates at the laboratories and other work areas. Thakur liked and respected Kumar immediately, as did most who met him. Both men had been trained in an environment that valued transparency, and Thakur felt an immediate allegiance.

On the evening of August 17, after just six weeks at the company, Kumar sent Thakur an urgent email, asking him to report to his office early the next morning. Always punctual, Thakur arrived so early that he passed gardeners watering impeccable shrubs and cleaners still polishing the lobby’s tile floors. He passed by the large portrait of Parvinder Singh, Ranbaxy’s renowned CEO, as he headed to Kumar’s office.

When Thakur stepped into his new boss’s office that morning, he was surprised at his appearance. Kumar looked underslept and uneasy, his eyes puffy and dark. He had returned the day before from South Africa, where Ranbaxy’s new CEO, Dr. Tempest, had dispatched him to meet with government regulators. It was clear from Kumar’s demeanor that the trip had not gone well. The two men strolled into the hall to order tea from white-uniformed waiters.

「We are in big trouble,」Kumar said to Thakur intently as they returned and then motioned for him to be quiet. In his office, Kumar handed Thakur a report from the World Health Organization (WHO). It summarized the results of an inspection that the WHO had conducted at Vimta Labs Ltd., a company that Ranbaxy had hired to administer clinical tests of its AIDS medicine. The WHO had done the inspection on behalf of the South African government, which was buying Ranbaxy’s antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to treat its AIDS-ravaged population.

The inspection, conducted by a French inspector named Olivier LeBlaye, had uncovered astonishing fraud. Many of the「patients」Vimta had enrolled in the study did not seem to exist. Much of the data purporting to measure the drugs’ dissolution in the patients’ blood appeared to have been fabricated. The graphs from tests on entirely different patients were identical, as though photocopied. As Thakur read, his jaw dropped. There could be no assurance that the medicine had even been given to actual patients, owing to the lack of documentation. And there was no evidence that Ranbaxy had monitored the work or audited the results, as was required. This level of fraud meant that the drugs—destined for terribly sick AIDS patients—had essentially been untested.

With the company’s credibility on the line, Dr. Tempest had sent Kumar to reassure South Africa’s drug regulators that the situation at Vimta was isolated. Once there, however, Kumar went further, assuring the South Africans that he would do a full review of the antiretroviral portfolio and redo patient tests if need be.

Thakur listened intently as Kumar spoke. On the plane back to India, Kumar’s traveling companion, the director of bioequivalence studies for the company’s entire generic portfolio, told him that the problem was not limited to Vimta or to the ARVs.

「What do you mean?」asked Thakur, barely able to grasp Kumar’s point.

The problem went deeper, said Kumar. He told Thakur that he wanted him to put aside all his other responsibilities for the foreseeable future, go through the company’s entire portfolio—every market, every product, every production line—and determine what was real, what was fake, and where Ranbaxy’s liabilities lay. Kumar then asked him to check in by day’s end, as they set this plan in motion.

Thakur left Kumar’s office stunned. Were more of Ranbaxy’s drugs compromised? If so, how could the company have gotten approvals from the FDA, the world’s toughest drug regulator?

As directed, he returned at the end of the day, but Kumar was not in. Thakur waited. Finally, Kumar arrived, looking visibly upset. Without a word, he sat at his desk and worked intently for twenty minutes before finally looking up.「I need a drink,」he said darkly. Kumar explained that he’d spent the day fighting with the corporate office over what to do with the fraudulently tested ARV drugs. Kumar had insisted that there was only one right course: to withdraw the drugs from the market immediately and conduct the biostudies properly.

Though the corporate office had initially agreed, it drafted a press release stating only that Ranbaxy would look into the problem. Kumar revised the draft to state that the company was pulling the drugs off the market, effective immediately. But corporate kept returning the initial, vaguely worded press release for his approval. He sent back his revision again.「I am a physician, and I cannot sign off on something knowing full well it will cause harm to patients,」Kumar declared.「I don’t care how much money or face Ranbaxy loses. Either this stuff comes off the market or I am gone.」Thakur did not want to contemplate losing another boss—especially one he liked so much.

Thakur later returned home to find his three-year-old son, Ishan, playing on the front lawn. He suddenly recalled an incident from the previous year when the boy had developed a serious ear infection. The pediatrician prescribed Ranbaxy’s version of Amoxyclav, a powerful antibiotic. Despite his son’s taking it for three days, the boy’s 102-degree fever persisted. So the pediatrician changed the prescription to the brand-name antibiotic made by GlaxoSmithKline. Within a day, Ishan’s fever was gone. Thakur took the boy in his arms, resolving not to give his family any more Ranbaxy medicine until he knew the truth.

0103富人的贫民窟

2003 年 8 月 | 印度古尔冈市

如果说全球化有一个总部的话，它很有可能就在古尔网。古尔网是一座完全靠世界 500 强企业的外包业务建立起来的城市。它位于新德里西南仅 18 英里处。20 年前，它还是一个沉睡的农业城镇，四周围绕着森林，依偎在壮丽的阿拉瓦利山脉之下。当跨国公司设法将后合功能转移到印度时，房产开发商们嗅到了商机。一座座办公楼从古尔的田野上拔地而起，取名「网络城」和「高尔夫球场」的道路纷纷建成。没过多久，古尔冈就成了所谓的「干禧城」。








古尔冈的天际线也打上了全球资本主义的烙印：埃森哲、摩托罗拉、IBM、惠普等多家公司将各自的商标加到了新购入的大楼上。随之而来的是成干上万的人和汽车，许多家商场也建了起来，这一切都得到了哈里亚纳邦城市开发局的鼓励，但这个开发局似乎并没有什么城市规划，只是一味地

迎接开发商而已。兰伯西也把研究总部设在了这里，并建了一块环境幽雅、

防守严密的园区。

古尔网的建城热潮没有受到多少限制，基础设施的建设也没有遇到多少阻力。事后胡乱追建的净水厂、下水道、地铁站和电力线无法跟上需求。入驻的企业和那些富裕的员工只能为了日益紧张的水源和电力而奔波。他们的大部分电力都是私下购买的，出了很高的价钱，柴油发电机使本已受污染的

空气更加肮脏。

坑坑洼洼的拥挤路面上，驴子和猪在由专职司机驾驶的汽车中间悠闲散步。据政府官员估计，部分由于私人住宅主人和企业为获得水源打出的泵压水井，地下水位不断下降，水源将在 20 年内完全枯竭。印度打算用古尔冈来展现本国在 21 世纪的世界经济中占据的中心位置。然而 BBC 却指出，古尔冈不过是一片「富人的贫民窟」

不过，对那些公司及其员工来说，这仍不失为一个理想的办公地点。2003 年夏天，萨库尔一家住进了一座带大门的独栋别墅，房子外面设了一座岗亭，雇了一名保安负责晚上看守。他家的地址恰好体现了古尔冈的迅猛发展：他们住的是「一期」楼房，也就是古尔冈第一批建成的区域。别墅带块草坪，里面铺白色地板，有几间雅致的房间用来招待客人。每当古尔不堪重负的电网停止工作时，他们就会启动自家的柴油发电机。萨库尔在地下室设了一间家庭办公室，边上就是儿子伊斯汗的游戏区。周末儿子会在那里看《巴尼与朋友》（Barney& Friend）的录像，萨库尔就在一旁工作。

身为印度裔的外国公民，萨库尔一到印度就应该去当地警局登记。于是

他来到了破旧的古尔冈警局。听到他是应签证要求而来，几名警员一脸茫然。萨库尔打定主意要让他们领会应该执行的政策，便回家把相关的表格打印了出来，然后回到警局向他们做了深入解释。他的守法做法几乎花掉了一

天时间。

离开警局时他带走了一张新表格，手工填写，在几个地方签了名。他将表格塑封，以免今后还要回来。在印度，文书手续似乎是避免混乱的保障，又似乎是引起混乱的原因。萨库尔后来反思说：「我们创造了堆积如山的文件，以确保如果明天发生意外，一切都有档案可。这是一套了不起的体制能为你做出的任何行为提供借口。反正它就记在放在某个地方的档案里。」

萨库尔不是那么天真，他对在印度生活的困难早有准备。但是他也下定了决心，不会在道徳标准上做妥协。在这个地下协议支配大量交易且常常伴随现金支付的国家，他决定继续做一个守规矩的人。当他在兰伯西专心工作时，他仍相信印度的私营企业不会像公共部门那样腐败臃肿。他也相信，企

业的效率能将印度带入 21 世纪。

在古尔网的主干道梅劳里古尔路上，摩托车、卡车、出租车和电动

三轮车来回奔驰。路边不时出现装着水果的驴车，还有流浪的山羊和水牛。还常有数以百计的人露宿在破旧的油布下。

拐进一条小巷，在一个岗亭和一道滑动门后面，坐落着兰伯西实验室的主要研发中心。入口的通道两旁装点着无可挑的灌木和盆栽。进入正门，锃亮的瓷砖地板上方悬挂着公司前任总经理帕温德·辛格的一幅肖像，他四年前死于癌症，终年 56 岁。肖像上的帕温德胡须雪白，双手合拢，坐在一块华丽的红色帷幕之下，头上戴一块白色的锡克教头巾，和头巾配套的一块手帕插在深色外套的胸袋里，他脸上的笑容安详，仿佛在审视一切，也在祝福一切。帕德温是公司创始人之子，印度媒体曾将他誉为「预见未来的炼金术士」。在他的领导下，兰伯西成为一家全球性公司，这一转变也创造了萨库尔的这个新职位。

萨库尔的头衔是「研究信息与组合管理主任」，他的任务是让快速发展的全球信息输送线有序而透明地运行。他是一名信息架构师，职责包括为公司的数据建立架构。这个新创造的职位使他成为少数能明确掌握公司广泛的全球市场信息的高管之一。他一头扎进工作。他雇了六个人，教会了他们组合管理，并开发了一张复杂的 Excel 数据表，以记录公司在世界各地的制药进程。

萨库尔经常在同事离开后加班很久。有时到了傍晚，家里的司机维贾伊·库马尔（Vijay Kumar）会载着苏娜尔和小伊斯汗来接他回家。还在学步

的伊斯汗会在父亲办公室的白色写字板上潦草地写下字母，或者在空无一人的走廊里欢快地弃来跑去。等到父亲收工，一家人就一起回家过夜。维贾伊每天必经梅劳里古尔冈路，他总是一有机会就快速驶离。因为这条路上车辆堵得越来越长，车流停滞不动。即使动起来了，也显得混乱不堪，红绿灯只有几盏，交通规则明白地贴着却没人遵守，划好的车道也很少有人在意。到了夜里，路上的坑洼、暗淡的路灯和徘徊的水牛更会平添危险。维贾伊是在前一年的夏天认识萨库尔的，当时这位高管正到兰伯西来面试。维贾伊 20 岁出头，在一家出租车公司工作，上级派他去给萨库尔开车萨库尔对他安静认真的工作态度以及他在古尔冈的街道上穿梭于可怕危险中的技术印象很深。当萨库尔搬回印度，他雇维贾伊做他的私人司机，这对一个农民家庭出身、工作仅能糊口的青年来说是一大进步。

一天晚上，上岗才几个月的维贾伊从兰伯西公司接了萨库尔，重新驶上了梅劳里古尔路。昏暗的主道上，摩托车和卡车在他们周围疾驰而过忽然，前方的车辆绕开了一堆看着像垃圾的东西。当维贾伊越驶越近时，他

们看出那是一个一动不动的人

像大多数司机一样，维贾伊认为最聪明最安全的做法是无视此人。但是当其他车辆绕开这个男人时，萨库尔却命令他把车停下。维贾伊恳求他让自继续行驶，但萨库尔拒绝了。他让维贾伊停到路肩上，跟他一起下车。昏暗道路上的车流被截断了，他们走到那个男人身边，他还活着，但喝醉了酒，头上正流着血。两人把他拖到了安全的地方。这次救人的举动非常疯狂，违背了安全驾驶的所有法则一还有多数印度人都知道的谨慎生存的法则：别管闲事，专心驾驶，不要主动帮陌生人。那样做没有好处。像他们这

样的救人举动，更可能会招来种种麻烦

且是对萨库尔来说，把男人拖离路面还不够。他虽然大体上是一个谨慎而消极的观察者，却也有一种相反的倾向：对于任何已经开始的项目他都会认真对待，无论结果可能是什么。他持要维贾伊和他一起将男子送到离这

儿一个半街区远的一家医院。

对维贾伊来说，拖着一个男人走在街上是他做过的最奇怪的工作之一。男人是死是活，又不影响他们，为什么还要这么做呢？到了医院，吃惊的医务人员似乎也同意维贾伊的看法，他们拒绝为男人治疗，除非萨库尔先付钱。萨库尔掏出 7000 比（当时约 140 美元，一笔巨款，相当于维贾伊两周的薪水），还留下了名片。他甚至没有想到隐瞒自己的身份。在维贾伊看来，这位新老板对于救人有着奇怪的美国式观念。这个年轻的司机预料得不错

这确实招来了麻烦。

第二天，一个警察出现在兰伯西公司，指控萨库尔撞倒了那名男子：要不是他先伤害了那名男子，又为什么要为对方付那么多钱呢？萨库尔打电话给人力资源部，叫他们处理此事。那个警察终于走了，萨库尔觉得肯定是公

司给了他一笔钱，叫他不要再追究了

在印度，受到「体制」的关照简直没有任何好处。帮助他人常常会招来怀疑。要不是萨库尔的公司财大气粗、能付钱摆平指控的事情，谁知道和警察纠缠会有什么后果？在印度，企业就像国王，而人更可能被看作可有可无。虽然这件事让萨库尔对自己返回印度的决定产生了一丝不安，但是他残存的疑虑很快就被兰伯西的一次特別活动打消了。

2003 年 11 月 21 日，兰伯西的通信部主管帕雷什·乔杜里（Paresh

Chaudhry）惊讶地看着美国特勤局的官员搜查兰伯西总部的办公室，并在楼顶布置狙击手。那一天，美国前总统比尔·克林顿莅临公开感谢兰伯西和另外两家印度仿制药公司答应生产价格低廉的抗艾滋病药物。在非洲和加勒比海沿岸的国家这些药一天的用量只卖大约 38 美分。而与它们等效的品牌药，即使最便宜的也比这个价格高出了 75% 左右。虽然这笔费用将由美国纳税人承担，但谈成协议的却是威廉·杰斐逊·克林顿基金会



乔杜里是一个勤奋而有创意的人，但他做梦都没想过自己会给一场有美

国前总统参加的活动做后動保障，更别提那是印度人民特别爱戴的比尔·克

林顿了。当克林顿于 2000 年 3 月下旬访问印度时，他成为超过 22 年以来第一位访问印度的美国总统。那一次，他强调了两国需要相互合作，共同对抗

艾滋病这样的疾病

克林顿对印度的喜爱不仅是表面功夫。他在 2001 年 4 月再度造访，这时古吉拉特邦在三个月前刚刚发生过一次毁灭性的地震，造成了 2 万人死亡。通过他担任主席的美国印度基金会，克林顿募集了数百万美元以重建地震中被毁的村庄。他还面对一群仰慕他的群众宣布：「只要我还活着，就会再来印

现在他果然又来了，这已是四年中的第三次，这一次是为了兑现印度和美国联手对付艾滋病的承诺。在接近两周的时间里，乔杜里始终全身心地为此做着准备，工作千头万绪：特勤局特工、宾客名单、将会到场的员工的名牌、到时候供应什么食物、克林顿会走什么路线、由谁来接待他，都要他来操心。这次访问是一个绝好的营销机会。乔杜里心里清楚：在他的职业生涯中再也不可能出现这样的机会了

多年来，他一直在邀请外国记者访问兰伯西。他向他们展示了公司的研究设施和现代化生产工厂，还向他们解说了公司为开发新型化学物质下了怎样稳健的功夫。但对方的反应总是大同小异：「非常感谢。我们感兴趣的话

会联系你的。」然后就没了下文

乔杜里知道，他要扭转的是一种广为流传的成见，那就是低成本等于低品质。大体上说，印度的仿制药厂家很少发明什么，只是重新制造已有的品牌药物，因此被全世界看作造假者和窃者。即使是在非洲，他们的药物也名声不佳。在喀麦隆，医生将他们的产品称为「pipi de chats「，意思是「猫尿」。2001 年，他们的形象才开始好转，当时美国正陷于「911」恐怖袭击之后的炭疽杆菌恐慌。拜耳建议美国政府购买他们的环丙沙星，那是少数几

种能治疗炭疽杆菌中毒的抗生素之一，但拜耳的售价每片将近 2 美元。兰伯西的报价只有这个价格的五分之一。乔杜里回忆说：「拜耳和美国及华盛顿的游说家想尽了办法要证明我们是一家做假药的公司。」最后是专利权阻止了美国政府购买兰伯西的仿制药。而乔杜里希望，今天的活动最终能为

公司扭转局面。

当身穿黑色西装、戴深红色领带的克林顿从滑动门走进来时，乔杜里是第一个伸出手去迎接他的人之ー。其他在门廊恭候的人都穿上了自己最好的西装，身子向前倾着，当他们站在那里等待前总统的祝福时，每个人的脸上

都透着紧张和兴奋。

热切的员工们聚集在礼堂聆听演讲，和他们一起的还有乔杜里期待已久的媒体从业者。萨库尔得到了一个前排的座位。克林顿和公司 CEO 布拉尔并肩站立，布拉尔戴着黑色头巾，穿深色西装，雪白的衬衫配一条花纹领带。自从帕温德·辛格去世，他就受命出任公司的 CEO，大家都称赞他是一位职业经理人，并将他的任命看作这个家族企业发展史上的一座里程碑。

克林顿表示，他这次来是为了感谢印度的几家公司，包括兰伯西、西普拉和矩阵实验室，谢谢他们愿意生产成本如此低廉的药物。他告诉底下聚集的人群：「我们必须给这些公司表表功，因为他们对我们的信任。」他还补充说，这些公司的努力确保了「我们能与其他国家开展合作，并说服他们治疗是一个可行的、负担得起的选择」

接着轮到布拉尔发言。「要降低这些药物的价格，就必须大量出售，而

要做到这一点，那些艾滋病感染大国就必须主动提出大量购买。这一点始终没有实现，直到克林顿基金会参与进来，将需要药物的国家和生产药物的人联结起来。

演讲结東后，克林顿挤进人群招呼大家，萨库尔与他握了手

这次访间完全符合乔杜里的期望，甚至比他期的还要好。从那一刻起，公司的销售额节节增长，声誉也有了改善。「我们公司终于成功了。」乔

杜里回忆当时的情况说道。兰伯西已经做好了在西方市场崛起的准备。「就凭我们这些产品，准能把美国的那些大家伙打得落花流水。」他这样总结了当时的感想，「这件事对人类有益，对政府有益，对人民也有益。为什么会

有人阻挠我们呢，老天！」

克林顿的访问振奋了整个行业。在这之前，世界各国政府已经面临一系列问题：人口老龄化，艾滋病蔓延，药价居高不下。它们哪里有钱给那些患者治病呢？克林顿给他们指了一条路。看来，印度的制药公司是站在天使那边的。就像兰伯西的下一任总经理布赖恩·坦皮斯特博士后来对《卫报》所说的那样：「我们廉价出售抗艾病药物赚不了多少钱…… 这真的是出于社会责任感，因为我们就在发展中国家，一打开门就能看见这些发展中国家的

问题。

这些公司能否靠打折出售抗艾滋病药物盈利，我们暂且不论，反正克林顿已经为印度的仿制药公司做了担保。他的这次访问在全世界创造了新的机会和潜在的利润。之后访问印度时，克林顿又去果阿参观了西普拉的工厂并在工厂的院子里种下一棵松树，这是公司的传奇董事长优素福·哈米耶德（Yusuf Hamied）为重要访客莅临定下的传统。对这些无法在华盛顿进行天花乱坠的游说的公司来说，这样的访问的价值无可估量。「我们向来把人道主义工作当作公关手段叫。」哈米耶德后来表示，「现在所有的门户都打开了。」在兰伯西逗留之后，克林顿又利用这次访问的机会去阿格拉参观了泰姫陵，这座白色大理石陵墓是 17 世纪莫卧儿帝国的一位皇帝为他的妻子建造。克林顿遵照参观守则，为了保护这处世界遗产免受空气污染，从陵墓外围坐电车来到门口。但是在返回酒店的路上，电车突然抛了叫，前总统只得徒步走完剩下的路程。对一个自豪于盛大典礼和待客之道的国家来说，这次意外有可能成为一次国际性的尴尬事件一这说明在熠熠生辉的表象之下，仍隐藏着老旧残破的基础设施

第四章品质的语言

2000 年 2 月 25 日

路易斯安那州新伊比利亚市

何塞·埃尔南德斯（Jose Hernandez）闻了闻空气的味道。这个 43 岁的美国药监局调查员又往 K&K 海鲜公司的蟹肉加工厂里面走了几步，这家工厂看起来叫人完全没有食欲。他的脑海中闪现出《联邦食品、药品及化品法》中奉为圭的那几条法规。他凝视工厂内部，几乎都能看见相关的页码：那是《联邦法规汇编》（Code of Federal Regulations，缩写 CFR）第 21 篇第 123 部分，第 6 条第（b）款，鱼类及水产品「风险分析关键控制点」计划。

但最大的麻烦还是他的嗅觉发现的。那是什么气味？那气味使他想起自己的拉布拉多犬「李维」洗澡后的味道，那是狗浑身湿透的毛发所散发的体味。本该遵守良好生产规范的海鮮工厂里却弥漫着那样的气味，这不是一个好兆头。他怀疑这家工厂对于消费者已经不再安全。

埃尔南德斯留着深色小胡子，头有点秀，戴着一副眼镜，有着跑步者的体格，他是美国药监局路易斯安那州拉法叶办公室的常驻主管。那是美国药监局的一处派出机构，有四名员工。埃尔南德斯是一名持徽章的美国药监局调员，他的工作是视察本辖区内的海鲜生产厂和小型医疗中心。他的年薪是 45000 美元，他靠这些钱养活妻子和四个孩子。美国药监局不会配备手提

电脑，埃尔南徳斯在视察中用纸笔记录，然后预约办公室里唯一的一部台式

电脑，到时候再把记录输入。视察海鲜工厂时他穿着一条工装裤和一双塑料

靴子。

这不是一般人的理想职业，但埃尔南德斯干得有声有色，他的名声渐渐传开了，人家都说他是美国药监局脑袋最聪明、直觉最准、精力最充沛的调查员之一。他居住在一座 50009 方英尺的大房子里，这阵子正在辛苦地重新装修。他从祖父那里学到了专业的木工手艺，小时候在波多黎各就是祖父把他带大的。埃尔南德斯毕业于圣胡安的美联大学，1987 年加入美国药监局做了全科调查员。他虽然没有炫目的研究生学历，却拥有一个精通机械的大脑。他知道东西应该怎么装配在一起，也能在装配不当时看出问题所在。的头脑能够迅速将事实组织起来并且记住。他还有一种神秘的直觉，能感应到事情出了岔子。

埃尔南德斯下了班就装修房子，平时一有机会就带孩子去露营。但他的脑筋从来不会休息。他的思绪总在《联邦食品、药品及化妆品法》中的 21 CFR 上徘徊。这些法规他几乎都能背诵，但他还是会带上纸质版，以便随时查阅。它们对于他就像《圣经》。他说：「讲了 30 年道的人，也总是得参照《圣经》。我从来不根据记忆回答问题，从来不依靠猜测。如果没有实实在在的法规，你就无法指控任何人。

他会思索各种模式：工厂中可见的工作流程的背后还隐藏着什么诡计？他看见的东西和法规之间有什么关联？在日常活动中，他也会暗自背通法规，比如用塑料瓶子喝水时，他就会想到装在瓶子里的水由 21CFR 的第 165.11 条规定，而盛水的容器适用的却是和水不同的法规（21CFR 的第 1250.40 条）。对他来说，视察就像在玩拼图，每次都要努力找出不见的那

按照美国药监局的法规，他只要亮出章，任何受美国药监局监管的生产场地就必须让他到任何一个角落视察。他事先从不通知对方一一法规也没有这样的要求。厂家如果拒绝调查员进入，就有被查封的可能。只要是为了彻底检查，他在工厂里想待多久就待多久，短则一天，长则两周。每次视察，他总是先在目标周驱车巡视一圈，看看大体情况。在他看来，这好比拍照前先用相机的广角镜头观察对象。接着他再拉近镜头，聚焦到重要的项目上。对于 K&K 海鲜工厂，他完全知道应该怎样视察。他要在最出其不意可能也是最不受欢迎的时候去系个回马枪。比如工厂煮食蟹肉的夜间。「如果你想找到证据，就必须抓现行。」他说。

那天他回家吃了晚饭。等孩子们睡着之后，他在夜里 9 点返回了工厂。

名员工老大不情愿地把他放了进去。这时湿狗的气味更浓烈了。循着气

味，埃尔南徳斯深入工厂。他发现了一间小厨房，一个平底锅放在炉子上，

锅里有几块碎肉狗肉。他又来到了生产车间，一个男人一边煮着活蟹

边在嚼着什么。他逮了个正着，不过相对于男人的行为，他所违反的 21 CFR 第 110.10 条第（b）款（8) 目倒是有些轻描淡写了：在加工食品的区域不许吃东西

美国药监局的法规定得狭窄而具体。它只说了不准吃东西，不管你吃的是一块饼干还是一块狗腰肉。埃尔南德斯对这件事的看法不会影响他的执法：他不能因为自己特别厌恶就加重对对方的处罚

从表面上看，连普通人也会对 K&K 肉工厂散发出的恶臭起疑。但埃尔南德斯还有一种天赋：他不仅会积极跟踪明显的线，还能透过工厂纤尘不染的表面，看到后面隐藏的东西。有一次他在路易斯安那州阿比塔斯普林斯的谢尔曼制药公司视察时证明了这一点，那家公司生产的是隐形眼镜润眼液和处方眼药水。1994 年，他就带着两名实习生来了，而七个月前工厂刚

刚安然无恙地通过了一次视察

埃尔南德斯的辖区是工厂和场地。于是他和往常一样，从场地开始检

查，先看厂房外面，接着再看里面。他信步走入厂房周围的树林，发现远处有一个燃的火堆，像是烧烤用的。他吩咐一名实习生找来一根树枝，在余里拨弄起来。他们翻出了一堆焦黑的药物，谢尔曼制药公司意图烧掉它们。可为什么呢？三名调查员在烧了一半的包装盒上发现了批号，上面显示这批药还没有过期。埃尔南德斯不禁怀疑起来：「如果产品合格，一般是不会销毁的，那么那些还没有被销毁的呢？」经过调查，他们发现谢尔曼制药公司烧的是因为受到污染而被退货的药物。公司没有调查受污染的原因，也没有按要求上报给美国药监局，而是企图毁灭证据。埃尔南德斯将他的发现详细记录在了一张名为「483」的视察表格里。

美国药监局的调查员会用三种代号标记视察结果：一种是「无行动指示」（No Action Indicated，缩写 NAI），意思是公司达标了；一种是「自主行动指示」，意思是公司必须补正不足；还有一种是「官方行动指示」（Official  Action Indicated，缩写 OAI），这是三种代号中情况最严重的，意思是公司有重大违规行为，必须马上整改或者接受处罚。在埃尔南德斯的审视下，K&K 和谢尔曼制药公司都收到了一张「官方行动指示」，即有可能面临更严厉的处罚。

1995 年，美国药监局对谢尔曼制药公司施加了最严厉的处罚，即「申请诚信政策」（Application Integrity Policy，缩写 AIP），这种程度的限制美国药监局大约只实施过十几项。它将谢尔曼制药公司置于美国药监局的严格监管下，并要求其自证没有欺诈行为。没过多久，谢尔曼制药公司就倒闭了。埃尔南斯对这家公司毫不同情，他对任何因此倒闭的公司都不同情。他的工作不是大事化小或者视而不见

美国药监局发挥的是任何政府部门最重要的功能之一。它的任务是确保我们的食品、药品、医疗设备、宠物食品和兽医物品能够安全使用，从而保

障公众健康。由此，美国药监局规范着大约五分之一的美国经济行为一一说到底，美国人接触和使用的大多数产品都归它管辖。美国药监局的总部设在马里兰州银泉市的一座庞大建筑物内，总员工数超过 17000 人，它还在全国

设有 20 个卫星办公室，在海外也有 7 个办事处。

你无论是将这些监管者看作英勇的公仆，还是捧着写字板记录工人洗手次数的讨厌鬼，都无法否认一个事实：在全世界人民的眼中，美国药监局都代表着最高标准。如果将美国药监局的监管者和大多数其他国家的监管者对比，结果就会像是比较「最先进的波音飞机和一辆旧自行车」一世界银行

的一位高级卫生专家这样说道

美国药监局那备受夸赞的声誉源自其监管方法。它不是只拿着一张清单对照，或者只检查最终产品。它采用的是一套基于风险的复杂体系，审查的是整个生产过程。根据美国药监局的标准，只要生产过程出现了纰漏，就可

以认为最终的产品也有纰漏。

美国药监局要求企业在一套名为「矫正与预防措施」的体系下开展自我检查。制药公司默克就以自我检查闻名，只要对某些药物批次的质量稍有怀疑，就会将它们全部废弃。一名美国药监局的前调查员解释说：「要经过调查才能发现真相，还要有一批知道怎么调查的人。如果监管机构不做调査那些企业就不会自查。」

调查员埃尔南德斯的方法或许显得简单：闻一闻，看一看，再用树枝拨

拨。但是他的脑中还装着概念和规范，它们都是在过去 100 多年中不断完善得来的，这些概念及规范与药物及食品安全都有关系，因为两者是同步发展的。今天的生产厂家必须公开并调查品质问题，而不是把坏掉的药物拿到树林里一烧了之。工人在把蟹肉装罐时不能吃狗肉（吃什么都不行），因为生产厂家必须控制环境中的污染物。「控」「透明」和「一致」的概念都现行良好生产规范的组成部分，那是一套精细的法规架构，制约着食品加工和药品生产的过程。

20 世纪初这些法规还不存在。目前全世界的厂家广泛奉行的「良好产规范」于 1962 年首次出现在《联邦食品、药品及化品法》的修正案中。今天的制药厂家都明白，现行良好生产规范是生产者必须循的最低要求，只有这样才能保证每一剂药都是完全一致、安全和有效的，并且含有包装上注明的成分。关于如何最大限度地确保食品和药品的安全，人们已经争论了数百年，这些要求就是在这漫长的争论中不断

中世纪的医务人员最早提出了药物品质取决于制作方法的观念。1025 年波斯哲学家伊本·西那（Ibn Sina）写了一本名为《医典》（Canon of Medicine)

的百科全书，书中提出了验证新型药剂的七条准则。他警告实验者，只要

改变一种物质的状况，比如将蜂蜜加热或者将金丝桃草贮存在鼠药附近，就会改变治疗的功效。

中世纪的统治者认识到了食品和药品的销售者会受利益诱惑欺骗消费

者，将具有食用或药用价值的成分换成劣质替代品，也了解这种成分不一致会

造成的危害。13 世纪中叶，英国颁布了一部《面包法令》이，禁止面包师在面

包中加入不可食用的物品，如锯屑和大麻。到了 16 世纪，全欧洲的城市都开始颁布药物的标准成分表，称为药典。1820 年，11 位美国医生在首都华盛顿会面，撰写了第一部国家药典，其前声明，这部药典的目的是「消除本国药物制备中的不规范和不确定的题

同年，一位名叫弗里德里克··阿库姆（Frederick Accum）的德国化学家

出版了一部颇有争议的著作，书名很长，叫《论食品假和烹任毒素：揭露面包、啤酒、葡萄酒、烈酒、茶、咖啡、奶油、糖果、醋、芥末、胡椒粉、奶酪、橄榄油、泡菜及其他家用物品中的掺假现象以及辨别方法》。阿库姆抨击了工厂在包装类食品中使用防魔剂和其他添加剂的做法，比如在橄榄油中加铅、在啤酒中加鸦片。阿库姆的这部著作在欧洲和美国拥有大量读者，它将食品安全问题以及监管的必要性带入了公众视野。美国一直到 1862

年才成立了一个名叫「化学部」的小型政府机构，负责调查食品掺假现象，员工在业部大楼的地下室办公一这个势单力薄的部门就是后来美国药监局的前身。

1883 年，来自印第安纳州边境的一位下巴方正、一丝不苟的医生哈维·威利（Harvey Wiley）接管了这个部门。时年 37 岁的威利一心致力于保障食品安全，被称作「化学家中的战士」。从 19 世纪 80 年代到 90 年代，他

数次在国会上呼制定一系列反假法律，但均未成功。到 1902 年，他的耐心耗尽了，他直接招募了 12 个健康的小伙子，让他们吃下硼砂、甲醛、水杨酸、亚硫酸和苯甲酸这些常用防腐剂。结果小伙子们捂着胃，在椅子上直犯恶心。这个离奇的试验引起全国震动。威利把它称为「卫生餐桌试验」叫，而媒体给它取名叫「试毒小队」。民众的愤慨激起了改善食品品质的

运动。

同一时间，美国海事医务署（国立卫生研究院的前身）卫生实验室的官员们也在和另一场公共卫生危机搏斗。1901 年，一场白喉感染（一种有时会致命的细菌性疾病）在圣路易斯市暴发。这种疾病的疗法是给患者注射抗毒素血清，而这些血清取自马的血液。当年 10 月，一名 5 岁幼童在注射血清后出现了奇怪的症状：她的面部和喉咙疼到发生痉挛，不到几周就死了。本来应该治好她白喉的血清反而使她染上了破伤风。官员们将污染源追査到一匹拉牛奶车的马「吉姆」身上，它在几周之前刚刚得过破伤风。

虽然圣路易斯市卫生局已在 10 月初得知这匹马的病情，之后才射杀了它，但卫生局的官员曾在吉姆死前给它放了两次血，一次是 8 月，一次是 9 月底。8 月的那批血液是干净的，但血量不够，装不满所有的瓶子。于是官员们又在瓶子里加入 9 月的那批血液，但没有更换标签。于是，有几个标着「8 月」的瓶子里，就混进了含有破伤风病菌的 9 月的血，13 名儿童因此

身亡。

为回应此事，国会于 1902 年通过了《生物制品管制法》，又称为《病毒毒素法》。它要求制药者必须遵守严格的标签标准，并雇科学家监督生产

它还授权卫生实验室通过视察监管生物制品行业。

到这时，记者也开始调査食品和药品产业堪忧的做法了。1905 年，《科利尔周刊》刊登了 11 篇系列报道一一《美国大局》，揭露了无效并且致命的「咳嗽药」、「镇静糖浆」和「卡他性炎粉」，震惊了美国公众。1906 年 6 月，美国国会终于通过了化学家哈维·威利游说了几十年的法律。这部《食品药品法》也叫《威利法》，它禁用了危险的食品添加剂，禁止生产者做出错误或误导性」的声明，还禁止销售标签错误及掺假的药品。此外，凡是按《美国药典》中列出的名称出售的药物，都必须符合效力、品质和纯度的公开标准。这部法律在当时虽然可圈可点，但其中也有不少漏洞。比如它允许产品中含有吗啡之类的有害物质，只要在标签上注明了。虽然法律可以将欺骗性的陈述定为犯罪，但证明推销员意图欺骗消费者就落到了政府的肩上。骗子们能轻易逃脱检举，只要一口咬定他们自己也信赖那些假药就行了。

1930 年，美国药监局正式成立。1933 年，其官员搜集了一批有害的食品和医药产品，并在国会和公众活动上展出。这些物品包括一种会令妇女失明的睫毛膏，一种含有毒鼠药、会造成瘫痪的局部毛发清除剂，还有一种富含镭元素的名叫「镭补」的补品，它号称能使人恢复性欲，但其实会引起致命的镭中毒。媒体称这场展览为「美国恐怖屋」。

几年后，国会又提出了一部新的食品药品法的法案，但是要等另一场悲剧的推动，法案才变成了法律。1937 年，共 107 人因服用一种名叫「磺胺酏剂」的液态抗生素而死亡，其中许多都是儿童「。死者情状痛苦。一位悲痛的母亲致信罗斯福总统述说了她女临终时的惨状：「我们看着她小小的身子来回扭动，听着她发出微弱而痛苦的尖叫。我恳求您采取措施，禁止此类药物的销售，它们会夺走幼小的生命，造成巨大的痛苦，使人彻底丧失对未

来的希望，就像今晚的我一样。」

磺胺能有效治疗链球菌感染。自 1932 年问世以来，医生一直给患者服用含有这种成分的药片和药粉。但是到 1937 年，马森吉尔公司的一位总药剂师却发明了一张儿童糖浆配方，要求将药物溶解在二乙二醇中ーー一种带有甜味的液体，后来被证明是一种致命的毒物，几十年后它成为防冻剂的种成分。当美国药监局调查员去马森吉尔的药厂调查时，他们惊讶地发现，所谓的「对照实验室只检查「酏剂的外观、味道和香气，根本不检查它的毒性」。一名美国药监局调查员在报告中写道：「看来他们只是将不同的药物混在一起，只要不爆炸就拿出去卖钱了。」国会被这次灾难吓坏了，终于在 1938 年通过了《联邦食品、药品及化妆品法》，它授权农业部部长在新药上市之前先对它们开展审批。任何公司想要销售药剂，都必须先提交一份申请，写明药物的成分和生产过程，还必须提交安全研究，让部长相信其生产方法、生产设施和管控手段都是充分的。

题是，怎样才算是「充分」的呢？这个问题在 1940 年 12 月至 1941

年 3 月之间凸显出来，那段时间有近 300 人在服用抗生素磺胺噻唑片后陷入昏迷或死亡，这些药片都是组约的温思罗普化学公司生产的。在它提交给美国药监局的申请中，公司宣称自己具有「充分」的管控手段。但实际上，他们有一个批次的抗生素被鲁米那污染了，其中的鲁米那含量达到了标准剂量的三倍之多。鲁米那是一种抗的巴比妥类药物。患者在吞下受到污染的抗生素时，其实也在不经意间服用了过量的巴比妥。在调查中，美国药监局得知这家公司是在同一个房间里组装抗生素和巴比妥类药物的，还常常混用两种药片的压片机。公司自己也不知道那些压片机里出来的是什么，因为它根本搞不清进去的是什么。

这次危机之后，美国药监局的官员们会见了一名行业顾问，该顾问告诉他们，大多数美国制药企业都缺乏充分管控，部分原因是对于什么是良好的管控体系，并没有一个统一的说法。美国药监局的药物主管给部门写了一

份备忘录，认为将来「药厂只是敷衍地表示有充分管控是不够的」。

不过，造成最深刻影响的还是一场幸好没有发生的悲剧。1960 年，辛辛那提的制药公司威廉·梅里尔（William S. Merrell）向美国药监局申请出售种名为「Kevadon」的药物明，也就是大众所知的「沙利度胺」（thalidomide 沙利度胺于 1956 年在德国问世，营销对象是整个欧洲、加拿大和南美洲的孕妇。这是一种安眠药，还能治疗晨吐。1960 年在美国，梅里尔公司已经开始向医生发放样品，但是还没有对外发售。美国药监局的一名干事弗朗西丝·凯尔西（Frances Kelsey）受命审核这次申请。她原本可以直接盖上橡皮图章了事，但是当她看到这家公司有限的安全研究时，她犹豫了。她询问公司的干部这种药物在人体内如何作用，他们非但不肯回答，还向她的上级投

诉，想迫使她批准新药。凯尔西拒绝了

到 1961 年冬天，事实证明她的决定是正确的。这时已经有越来越多的

国外医生发现沙利度胺和婴儿先天性四肢严重畸形之间的关联性，比如萎缩的腿部和鳍状的手臂。1 万多位母亲服药后生下了有残疾的孩子。这下

凯尔西被奉为英雄。正因为她拒绝屈服，美国人才逃过了最坏的情况，与那些样品有关的畸形只有 17 例。这次涉险过关再度刺激了美国国会，使它在 1962 年对《联邦食品、药品及化枚品法》做了一次增补，称为《基福弗一哈里斯修正案》。根据它的要求，申请者如果要证明自家的药物安全而且有效，不仅要在包装上注明可能的副作用，还要向美国药监局报告不良反应事件。最重要的是，修正案重新界定了何谓药物掺假：工厂里的产品，只要其生产过程不符合「现行良好生产规范」，就会被认定为受到了污染。

这是一个巨大的变化。从那以后，生产过程成了决定品质的关键，这个标准一直沿用至今。这个新定义也赋予了美国药监局执行良好生产规范的权力。但我们接着又要问了：这种规范应该有哪些呢

1962 年年底，一组美国药监局调查员开会讨论出了这些规范的初稿。新

法规在次年公布，它们确立了「药物加工、包和储存」环节的几项新标准。生产过程的每个「关键步骤」都必须由一名「专业且负责的人士执行」。工人们必须为每个药物批次写下详细的「批次生产记录」，其中要包括一份总配方的拷贝文件以及每个生产步骤的资料。新规实施以后，生产商们勉力奉行。更多的药物被召回了。

1966 年，美国药监局对美国市场上最重要且使用最普遍的临床药物了一次重要调査。在他们检测的 4600 份样品中，8% 的药物药效过强或过弱。美国药监局认定，要让生产商跟上新要求，最好的办法就是进行严格视察。1968 年，美国药监局发动了为期三年的密集闪电战。调查员不打招呼就出现在许多公司门，并在那里驻扎办公，有时长达一年。他们或纠缠，或说教，或配合，或霸道。哪家生产商要是不能或不愿遵照调员的要求行事，就勒令其停业。这次行动实际上开启了美国药监局的当代视察项目。

在这几十年追求品质的漫长征途中，最关键的转变就是从监管产品变为监管生产过程。制药商再也不能等到药物被制造出来之后再做检测了，因为那是典型的不合格生产过程。也许最后你可以检测一个批次里的几片药片，但如果共有 100 万片呢？你是不可能一片片检测的。必须对所有生产环节都进行记录和检测，将品质内化于过程之中。

这种做法被称为「过程验证」，在 20 世纪 80 年代末流传开来。每个步骤产生的数据都成为关键的指导方针。这些数据必须「可追溯、易辨认、同时记录、是原始或原样复制的以及准确」，按首字母缩写为「ALCOA」の。

就像迈兰公司负责技术支持的副总裁凯文·科拉尔（Kevin Kolar）解释的那样，一种药物的成品与生产过程中的数据是密不可分的：「两样中少了

样，它就不是一件产品… 没有记录的事就等于没发生过。对细节要一丝

不荷地关注，那是你的事业，你的使命。」

随着时间的推移，日益明了的是：路易斯安那州的何塞·埃尔南德斯注定要去做一些比检查狗肉更复杂的工作。到 2000 年，制药业务开始向海外转移。在接下来的八年里，海外工厂为美国市场生产的药物产品数量翻了一番。到 2005 年，美国药监局监管的国外厂家数第一次超过了美国

本土的。

美国药监局越来越迫切地需要自愿到国外出差的调查员。埃尔南德斯主

动报名，开始到日本、澳大利亚、德国、印度和中国视察，一个国家接着一

个国家地跑。2003 年，他加入美国药监局海外视察团，这个团队人员很少，总部仍设在美国，但专门视察国外工厂。这是一项艰难的工作，极费心力。

埃尔南德斯始终把政府发的那本绿色笔记本放在床头，就连半睡半醒之间产生的想法也要匆匆记录下来。他对自己的上司毫无敬意，他觉得那些人关心的是办公室里的人事纠葛，而不是公共卫生。保护美国消费者的责任感使他

充满千劲。

美国药监局知道，要想让药厂遵守规章，最好的办法就是派调查员在他们最意想不到也最不情愿的时候，直接上门检査。只要药厂对这样的突击检査还心怀畏惧，他们就更可能遵守良好生产规范。然而在国际范围内，视察中的攻守就完全是另一回事了。埃尔南德斯再也无法直接走进工厂，亮出微章并开始视察了。相反，美国药监局会提前几个月通知外国工厂。接下来由外国工厂出具正式邀请函，供美国药监局调查员申请旅行签证。法律并没有要求提前通知，它也不是开展视察的最佳方法。但美国药监局着急处理不断积压的国外视察任务，提前通知自然成了解决许多难题的一个临时方案它能确保对方工厂的相关员工视察时在场，也是对于外国政府的一种外交表

态。只是在这套体系下，海外视察不再能对一家工厂的真实情况进行如实评

估，而更像是一次排练好的表演。

工厂会安排调查员的行程及其在当地的活动。「突击是不可能做到了。」埃尔南德斯说。这也使他更加依赖自己的直觉以及多年来积累的经验。当他身处遥远的国度，听到的尽是陌生的语言，他总是一次次回到「工厂和场地」这一理念。这简直成了一句口号。对他来说，这意味着要「开阔思维」。

在这个过程中，他也确立了一种信念：即使语言、文化、时区不同，品质永远是一门自成一体的语言。而他显然是能流利运用这门语言的。无论一家工厂是否会进行操控，他都可以通过观察、闻味或翻弄找到答案。比如，他常常看不懂记录里写的是什么，但他会审视其外观：上面有没有污渍？复印机上有没有指纹？相对应的两个批次，一份的体量是否小于另一份？记录本上有没有折痕或者磨损？如果没有，为什么没有？凭着这份细心，他常能发现一些同事看漏的东西。有一次，一家海外药企把记录打印在一种厚纤维纸上。他发现质检主任叫属下篡改数据、用锋利的刀片刮掉纸上的文字。这些线索都是一幅巨大拼图上的碎片，它们共同拼出了一家生产工厂的面貌。只是现在这幅拼图还跨越了不同的大洲。

全球化在一道要求透明的流程上投下了阴影，距离成为美国药监局过去 170 年积累的每一条安全经验的最大挑战。帕特里克·卢克莱（Patrick  Lukula）博士是美国药典全球健康影响项目的前任副总裁，他对此做了解释：

「全球化的问题，就在于你不在那些国家生活… 所以你简直要踮着脚尖走路，开展突击检査，听人举报揭发。」他还宣称：「监管，是一件猫捉老鼠的活计。」

第五章灯亮起

2004 年

印度哈里亚纳邦古尔网市

BMS 是一家遵守法律的古板企业。在那里，所有层级的员工都要参加各

种学习班，主题从维护正确的审计记录到具有性别敏感性的事务都有。

而在兰伯西，萨库尔面临的却是一片混乱。这家公司野心勃勃，很有想

法，但又笼罩着一股凭感觉办事的氛围。负责临床研究的副总裁一根接一根

地吸烟，一天要吸掉四包。在公司的新泽西工厂中，敏感的药物成分被放进

员工的冰箱，边上就是一块双料比萨。高管会议上争论激烈，有时还会升级到拳脚相加。萨库尔猜想，这种散漫的环境是一家激进的公司扩张太快的结果：「这里没有什么规矩，这和我在过去 10 年～12 年里学到的东西截然相反。」但是当 2003 年即将结束时，他并没有因为这里的混乱和训练的缺乏而灰心，反而把这看作自己在公司很被需要的标志。他打算将公司的所有数据收集归档。将混乱的纸质记录转移为有序的数字记录是一场更为巨大的转变中的一部分，也就是把这家以印度为中心的保守公司，改造成一家遵守保持记录的公认规范的外向型跨国企业。

他的团队对最基本的流程做起了标准化改造，具体到公司报告中使用的

模板和字体。他们怀着使命感工作，在促进兰伯西转型的过程中，展现了优

秀的洞察力和创意。跟随萨库尔一起从 BMS 来到此地的文卡特·斯瓦米纳坦

说：「我们来了就要改变世界，来了就要用不同的方法做事。」他甚至在混乱中看到了亮点：「我们团队不用担心这个不批准、那个不批准。」就像在 BMS

时那样。他们只要按照计划推进就行了。

不过混乱毕竟阻得了进步。兰伯西并没有一个公司规模的体系来管理

其药品组合。各个分部之间彼此不通消息，根本无法跟踪数据。不同的分部甚至会用欧元、美元和卢比等不同的货币上报收入。公司的大部分记录都写在纸上。通过一次普査，萨库尔得知，公司的科学家半数以上的时间都找不到自己一年前创建的文档。他的团队对各个系统做了计算机化和标准化处理，使科学家们能够阅读并储存关键文档，比如标准操作程序和研究

报告。

萨库尔最初的一项工作是将公司临床试验中的记录数字化，包括知情同意表格、患者病历和实验室结果。他派迪内希·卡斯胡里尔去马吉迪亚医院办理此事，兰伯西运营着那里的一个临床试验区域。这次走访很紧张。事后，萨库尔接到了区域负责人的电话，说他们那里网络太差，无法将记录数字化。萨库尔向他保证会在医院和兰伯西的数据中心之间接一条新的线路。然后他又派了团队中的另ー个人去回访。这一次对方干脆把他拒之

门外。

在萨库尔看来，对这种行为最符合逻辑的解释就是，他闯入了一个等级森严的熟人网络，那些老员工感觉他是来夺权的。他不仅是这家公司的新人，还来自品牌药的世界。他猜想这些新同事可能会戒备他身上的优越感。于是他决定缓慢而有礼貌地推进工作，免得被人指责他「盛气凌人」一他加入兰伯西后没有多久，管理层对他的审核中就出现了这样的评语。

那份审核报告里写到萨库尔自信、自主，对别人要求很高，在面临压力时也很善于控制情绪。但其中也提到他「渴望推进事情，在将分析所得的结论付诸实施时稍显急迫」。评语还写道：「他明白兰伯西拥有不同的企业文化，他所渴望的直接、开放的交流未必能达到他所追求的目标。不仅

如此，他的高期望并不总能实现，有时会导致他在人际交往中表现得缺乏

他的态度不是唯一的题。公司派他加入了一个委员会，负责制定公司的记录保存规定。几次会议之后，公司的首席信息官通知委员会成员，说已经决定电子邮件记录保存两年之后就要删除。萨库尔激烈地反对这项安排。他在一封电子邮件中指出，大多数研发项目的时间都超过 10 年，过早地删除记录可能使公司丢失重要成果并与监管者发生冲突。

几天后，他接到了那位首席信息官的电话，对方要求他删除这番言论，还有他手上与此有关的所有会议记录。对方告诉他，这是 CEO 办公室的直接命令。于是，制定更好的记录保存规定的努力，就这样被一道删除所有辩论

记录的命令终结了

对萨库尔和他的团队来说，在这家印度公司乃至在整个印度企业界做事，就像在《爱丽丝镜中世界奇遇记》的感觉；他们一路遇到了各种障碍，有的令人困扰，有的荒唐可笑。有一次，他们想购买一款名为  Documentum」的电子文档管理软件。在他们看来，市场上并没有能与之比肩的产品。但当他们将计划提交给采购委员会审批时，对方却说：「我

们需要三个报价。」

「但这种软件只有这么一款。」他们试着解释。对方说不行。

我们就要三个。」采购委员会还催促他们，「去找几个当地人充数就

行了。

还有一次，卡斯胡里尔在和配方团队的几个主任开会，讨论如何将实验

室的工作数字化。对方先是嘟囔着反对了几句，接着一名主任用出了一个问题：「如果我们这么做，还怎么倒签文档呢？」负责配方的副总裁赶忙插嘴说，那个主任的问题纯属假设。不管是假设与否，他们对于创立透明的工作体系显然是抵触的。但萨库尔的团队没有理会他们的顾虑，继续推进工作。毕，他们来这里就是为了改良公司及其体制。

200 年 1 月，公司的内部纠纷终于爆发了。布拉尔布他将卸任公司的 CEO 一职，他在权力斗争中败给了公司的法定继承人、公司创始人的儿子马尔文德·辛格（Malvinder Singh）。继任 CEO 的是布赖恩·坦皮斯特博士

位头发灰白蓬乱、脸上长满皱纹的英国化学家。在外界看来，提拔坦皮斯特只是给马尔文德继位铺平道路，后者 32 岁，此时已经被提拔为药物总监斯瓦米纳坦表示，许多人都把此举看作职业化管理的沦丧以及「只凭一两个人的喜好管理的王朝式家族企业」的胜出。对萨库尔和他的盟友而言，这个消息不是一个好兆头，他们原本希望兰伯西能成为 21 世纪的印度版辉瑞

更大的打击还在后头。在一次公司园区举办的印度教胡里节庆典上，公司员工和他们的家人一边吃着餐车上的食物，一边听着现场音乐。萨库尔站在人群之中，看见上司拉希米·巴布海亚在向他招手。两人走到一个安静的角落，巴布海亚立即对他说：「我准备离开兰伯西了。」萨库尔愣住了。巴布海亚加入公司才不到两年。当初就是他设立了萨库尔的职位，还在公司内部为他的创新精神辩护。因为他的担保，萨库尔才放弃了一份待遇优厚的工

作，抛下了美国的稳定生活。可现在他自己却要走了？「你走了我怎么办？

萨库尔问他

「你会没事的，况且我也不是马上就走。」巴布海亚说，「我会再待几个月，我们到时候再商量。」在之后的几个月里，他的这位伯乐变得对公司极为不满。他告诉年轻的萨库尔，兰伯西不是像他这样的人应该工作的地方。次，他们在一家优雅的酒店和几个过来协助培训的美国科学家吃饭，席间巴布海亚对公司进行了猛烈抨击，使在座的人都很尬。他的怨恨让萨库尔感到困惑

饭后，萨库尔将巴布海亚拉到一边，问他为什么这么生气。巴布海亚吞吞吐吐，只说他知道了许多足以使公司关门的「鬼把戏」。

几个月后，萨库尔去巴布海亚家中吃午饭。餐桌上，萨库尔再次说起这个话题。

迪内希，我仿佛在试图给一辆时速 60 英里的汽车换轮胎。」这位伯乐

说道。萨库尔要他说明白些。巴布海亚提到公司 2004 年度的预算。萨库尔清楚地记得那些数字，因为他曾为各个区域的药品组合编纂跨部门数据。「你认为那些数字合理吗？」巴布海亚问他

库尔回想了开发中的产品数目：大约 150 种。就像巴布海亚所说，在美国，开发每种仿制药的成本最少是 300 万美元。在印度的开发成本大约是这个数字的一半，因为劳动力便宜许多。因此兰伯西的开发总预算应该在 2.25 亿美元左右，但是据萨库尔的记忆，它实际上只有约 1 亿美元。公司在自己的工作中打了很大的折扣。

萨库尔记住了这条信息，两人继续聊别的。然而巴布海亚的离职总使他不安。缺了这位高层盟友，他自己在兰伯西的前途就变得暗淡了

4 年 7 月，萨库尔重新燃起了希望，因为他遇见了新上司一一拉金德尔·库马尔（Rajinder Kumar）博士。库马尔高大英俊，举止优雅，性格开朗和蔼，据说他品格正直，背景也很显赫。他来自伦敦，曾在那里担任葛兰素史克公司精神病药物临床究和开发部门的全球主管。

库马尔早年在苏格兰的邓迪大学完成医学训练，再到皇家外科医师学

会专攻精神病学。然后他加入史克必成公司，成为主管神经科学领域临床

开发和医学事务的副总裁。他参与开发了帕罗西汀（Paxil），一种治疗抑郁症的畅销药。他富于同情心，习惯于为患者着想，也会严格遵守良好生产规范。

与满面怒容、在办公室时要放下百叶窗帘的巴布海亚不同，库马尔的办公室大门是开的。他经常四处走动，到实验室和其他工作区域与下属碰面。萨库尔和大多数人一样

见到库马尔就觉得又喜欢又尊敬。他们

俩都在一个重视开放透明的环境中接受过训练，萨库尔立刻对他产生了忠

诚感。

8 月 17 日傍晚，刚在公司上任六周的库马尔给萨库尔发了一封急电子邮件，要他第二天一早到自己的办公室报到。向来准时的萨库尔来得很早到公司时园丁还在浇灌无可挑的灌木，清洁工也还在擦洗大堂地面的瓷砖。萨库尔经过声望卓著的前 CEO 帕温德·辛格的巨大肖像，走向库马尔的

办公室。

当萨库尔那天清晨踏进这位新上司的办公室时，他被对方的面容吓了跳。库马尔看起来睡眠不足，神情紧张，他的眼皮浮肿，眼圏发黑。他前天刚从南非回来，公司的新任 CEO 坦皮斯特博士派他去和那里的政府监管人员见面。从库马尔的神态看，这次出差显然不太顺利。两人漫步到大堂，向

身穿白色制服的侍者要了茶水。

「我们有大麻烦了。」库马尔回到办公室后对萨库尔认真地说道，然后示意他不要声张。在办公室里，库马尔递给萨库尔一份世界卫生组织（以下简称世卫组织）的报告，报告总结了世卫组织一次视察的结果。这次视察的对象是维姆塔实验室有限公司，这家公司受雇于兰伯西，为其抗艾滋病药物做临床检测。世卫组织的这次视察代表的是南非政府，当时该公司正要购买兰伯西的抗逆转录病毒药物，以治疗国内猖獗的艾滋病。

负责这次视察的法国调査员奥利维耶·勒布雷（Olivier Leblaye）发现了

个令人震惊的骗局：维姆塔在研究中招募的许多「患者」根本就不存在大量关于药物在患者血液中溶解情况的数据都是捏造的。完全不同的患者，在检测中的数据图形居然完全一致，简直像是复印出来的。萨库尔一边读着报告，一边惊讶得张大了嘴巴。因为缺少材料，根本无法证明这些药物曾经用于真实的患者。同样没有证据表明，兰伯西曾经按要求监管过这项研究或者审计过研究成果。这种程度的欺诈，意味着这些将要用来治疗艾滋病重症患者的药物根本没有经过检测。

因为事关公司声誉，坦皮斯特博士派库马尔去南非，并向药监部门保

维姆塔的情况是孤立事件。但是到了那里之后，库马尔却更进了一步他向南非人保证会对所有抗逆转录病毒药物做完整评估，如有必要还会重做

患者试验。

萨库尔专心听着库马尔的话。库马尔说，在返回印度的飞机上，他的旅伴、负责对公司所有仿制药做生物等效性研究的那位主任告诉他，这不

仅仅是维姆塔或者抗逆转录病毒的间题

这是什么意思？」萨库尔不太明白库马尔的意思，开口道问题比这更深。」库马尔回答。他告诉萨库尔，希望他在可以预见的将来放下手头的一切工作，将公司的整个产品组合彻底检查一遍，包括每一个市场、每一种产品、每一条生产线，他要确定哪些是真的、哪些是假的，兰伯西又该负哪些责任。库马尔还吩咐他下班以后再来一，届时两人将启动

这个计划

离开库马尔的办公室时，萨库尔住了。还有其他兰伯西的药品出了问题吗？如果有，那公司又是怎么拿到美国药监局批文的？那可是世界上最严

格的药物监管机构啊

班后，萨库尔奉命回到了库马尔的办公室，但是库马尔不在。萨库尔等了许久。终于，库马尔出现了，看得出他的心里很乱。他一句话都不说径自坐在办公桌前专心工作了 20 分钟，然后抬起头来，阴郁地说道：「我得喝一杯。」他解释说，自己费了一天的工夫和总部办公室纠缠，争辩应该如何处理那些假检测的抗逆转录病毒药物。库马尔坚持说正确的道路只有条：立即从市场上召回药物，并开展恰当的生物学研究。

虽然总部办公室起初同意了，但后来又起草了一篇新闻稿，里面只说兰伯西会对这个问题「开展调查」。库马尔修改了草稿，表示公司将从市场上召回药物，决定立即生效。但总部办又把稿子改回原来那个含糊其词的版本，要他批准。他再次修改，将它打回。「我是一个医生，不能明知一种药物对患者有害还批准它。」库马尔宣布，「我不管兰伯西会损失多少钱、丢多

少面子。要么这东西下市，要么我辞职走人。」萨库尔不敢想象再失去一位

上司，尤其是这位他那么喜欢的上司。

萨库尔回到家里，看见 3 岁的儿子伊斯汗正在门前的草坪上玩。他忽然回想起去年的一件事，当时这孩子的耳朵严重感染。儿科医生给他开了兰伯西仿制的阿克舒（Amoxyclav），一种强力抗生素。但孩子吃了三天药，约 38.9C 的高烧依然不退。于是医生又把药换成了葛兰素史克生产的品牌抗生素。不到一天工夫，伊斯汗就退烧了。萨库尔把儿子搂进怀里，他决定找到

真相之前，再也不给家里人用兰伯西的任何一种药物。
