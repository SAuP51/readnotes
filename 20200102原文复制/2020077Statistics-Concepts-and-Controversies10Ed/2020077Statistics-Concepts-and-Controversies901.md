Case Study: Estimating Crowd Size

Crowd science is used to estimate the number of people in a large crowd. Crowd scientists may have a background in census work, geospatial analysis, remote sensing, or cartography, among other qualifications. Individuals not trained in crowd science are not good at estimating the size of a crowd.

Consider the January 20, 2017, inauguration of Donald Trump. Was President Trump correct in estimating the number of people in attendance as somewhere between 1 and 1.5 million people? Estimates for the number of attendees at the Women’s March in Washington held the day after the 2017 inauguration had estimates ranging between 500,000 and 1 million people. Side-by-side photos of the two events show more attendees at the Women’s March than at the inauguration.

Both President Trump and the organizers of the Women’s March wanted large numbers of people at their events. How do we get accurate data on the number of attendees at each event?

Business data, advertising claims, debate on public issues—we are assailed daily by numbers intended to prove a point, buttress an argument, or assure us that all is well. Sometimes we are fed false data. Sometimes, people who use data to argue a cause care more for the cause than about the accuracy of the data. Others simply lack the skills needed to employ numbers carefully. We know that we should always ask:

How were the data produced?

What do we want to measure?

What exactly was measured?

We also know quite a bit about what good answers to these questions sound like. That’s wonderful, but it isn’t enough. We also need「number sense,」the habit of asking if numbers make sense. Developing number sense is the purpose of this chapter. To help develop number sense, we will look at how bad data, or good data used wrongly, can mislead the unwary.

What Didn’t They Tell Us?

The most common way to mislead with data is to cite correct numbers that don’t quite mean what they appear to say because we aren’t told the full story. The numbers are not made up, so the fact that the information is a bit incomplete may be an innocent oversight. Here are some examples. You decide how innocent they are.

Example 1

Snow! Snow! Snow!

Crested Butte attracts skiers by advertising that it has the highest average snowfall of any ski town in Colorado. That’s true. But skiers want snow on the ski slopes, not in the town—and many other Colorado resorts get more snow on the slopes.

Example 2

Yet more snow

News reports of snowstorms say things like「A winter storm spread snow across the area, causing 28 minor traffic accidents.」Eric Meyer, a reporter in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, says he often called the sheriff to gather such numbers. One day, he decided to ask the sheriff how many minor accidents are typical in good weather: about 48, said the sheriff. Perhaps, says Meyer, the news should say,「Today’s winter storm prevented 20 minor traffic accidents.」

Example 3

We attract really good students

Colleges know that many prospective students look at popular guidebooks to decide where to apply for admission. The guidebooks print information supplied by the colleges themselves. Surely no college would simply lie about, say, the average SAT score of its entering students or admission rates. But we do want our scores to look good and admission standards to appear high. What would happen if SAT scores were optional when applying for admission? Students with low scores will tend to not include them as part of their application so that average scores increase. In addition, the number of applicants increases, admittance rates decrease, and a college appears more selective.

Some argue that a test-optional policy (TOP) allows colleges to admit a more diverse group of students. How might this happen? In the past,「criticisms of the test’s cultural and racial biases, lack of predictive power, and inability to measure an individual student’s intelligence」are problematic for schools that are trying to increase diversity. Way back in 1969, Bowdoin College was the first school to adopt a TOP, claiming that standardized tests「tend to work in favor of the more advantaged elements of our society, while handicapping others.」More recently, Hobart and William Smith Colleges adopted an SAT-optional policy for fall 2006, and their reported average SAT scores jumped 20 points. At the same time, national average SAT scores declined.

The point of these examples is that numbers have a context. If you don’t know the context, the lonely, isolated, naked number doesn’t tell you much.

Are the Numbers Consistent with Each Other?

Here is an example.

Example 4

The case of the missing vans

Auto manufacturers lend their dealers money to help them keep vehicles on their lots. The loans are repaid when the vehicles are sold. A Long Island auto dealer named John McNamara borrowed more than $6 billion from General Motors between 1985 and 1991. In December 1990 alone, Mr. McNamara borrowed $425 million to buy 17,000 GM vans customized by an Indiana company, allegedly for sale overseas. GM happily lent McNamara the money because he always repaid the loans.

Let’s pause to consider the numbers, as GM should have done but didn’t. At the time GM made this loan, the entire van-customizing industry produced only about 17,000 customized vans a month. So McNamara was claiming to buy an entire month’s production. These large, luxurious, and gas-guzzling vehicles are designed for U.S. interstate highways. The recreational vehicle trade association says that only 1.35% (not quite 2800 vans) were exported in 1990. It’s not plausible to claim that 17,000 vans in a single month are being bought for export. McNamara’s claimed purchases were large even when compared with total production of vans. Chevrolet, for example, produced 100,067 full-sized vans in all of 1990.

Having looked at the numbers, you can guess the rest. McNamara admitted in federal court in 1992 that he was defrauding GM on a massive scale. The Indiana company was a shell company set up by McNamara, its invoices were phony, and the vans didn’t exist. McNamara borrowed vastly from GM, used most of each loan to pay off the previous loan (thus establishing a record as a good credit risk), and skimmed off a bit for himself. The bit he skimmed amounted to more than $400 million. GM set aside $275 million to cover its losses. Two executives, who should have looked at the numbers relevant to their business, were fired.

John McNamara fooled General Motors because GM didn’t compare his numbers with others. No one asked how a dealer could buy 17,000 vans in a single month for export when the entire custom van industry produces just 17,000 vans a month and only a bit over 1% are exported. Here’s another example in which the numbers don’t line up with each other.

Example 5

Are unemployment numbers trustworthy?

As mentioned in Example 8.3, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has used the same formula to calculate the U.S. unemployment rate since 1994. Interestingly, prior to becoming president, Donald Trump criticized the unemployment rate reported by the BLS, even calling the calculated rate「total fiction」as recently as December 2016.

In October 2012, Trump said that a 7.8% unemployment figure was incorrect and claimed that unemployment was in reality at least 15%. Three years later, he said that the reported 5.4% unemployment rate was more like 40 or 42%. According to one Washington Post article, Trump called unemployment numbers「phony」at least ten times between 2012 and 2016. However, in March 2017, President Trump stated that the unemployment rate「may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now.」There was a lack of consistency in the numbers that the BLS and President Trump reported over the years. If the BLS has been using the same formula since 1994, how can the unemployment rate be real and correct now?

During his campaign for president, Donald Trump counted everyone who didn’t have a job, including those who are retired, are students, or are stay-at-home parents, as unemployed. However, the BLS considers these groups to be not in the labor force and thus does not include them in the calculation of the unemployment rate. If these groups were included in the calculation, the unemployment rate would skyrocket. This explains the inconsistency between President Trump’s numbers and those reported by the BLS. Perhaps it was a lack of understanding of what goes into the calculation that led to this inconsistency prior to Donald Trump becoming president. Now that he is President Trump, he understands why the BLS calculation is correct. Any of us can come up with inconsistent numbers if we do not know how the official numbers are calculated.

Here’s an example where we know something is wrong because the numbers don’t agree. This is part of an article on a cancer researcher at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, which was accused of committing the ultimate scientific sin, falsifying data.

Example 6

Check the numbers

When reporting data about the Minnesota mouse experiments, the cancer researcher at Sloan-Kettering reported percentages of successes for groups of 20 mice as 53, 58, 63, 46, 48, and 67. This is impossible because any percentage of 20 must be a multiple of 5!

Are the Numbers Plausible?

You can often detect dubious numbers simply because they don’t seem plausible. Sometimes, you can check an implausible number against data in reliable sources such as the annual Statistical Abstract of the United States. Sometimes, as the next example illustrates, you can do a calculation to show that a number isn’t realistic.

Example 7

Now that’s relief!

Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in August 2005 and caused massive destruction. In September 2005, Senators Mary Landrieu (Democrat) and David Vitter (Republican) of Louisiana introduced the Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief and Economic Recovery Act in Congress. This bill sought a total of $250 billion in federal funds to provide long-term relief and assistance to the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. Not all of this was to be spent on New Orleans alone, and the money was not meant to be distributed directly to residents affected by the hurricane. However, at the time, several people noticed that if you were one of the 484,674 residents of New Orleans, $250 billion in federal funds was the equivalent of

This would mean that a family of four would receive about $2,063,240!

Now it’s your turn

9.1 New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Ahead of the 2018 New Year’s Eve celebration, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that New York City expected「up to 2 million people in Times Square itself」for the festivities. According to the Associated Press,「crowd-size experts scoff at those mammoth figures … saying it’s impossible to squeeze that many of even the skinniest revelers into such a relatively small space.」Is de Blasio’s 2 million figure accurate? You can use the fact that the official website of Times Square (www.timessquarenyc.org) reported just under 420,000 people walked through Times Square on its busiest weekday during December 2018.

Are the Numbers Too Good to Be True?

In Example 6, lack of consistency led to the suspicion that the data were phony. Too much precision or regularity can lead to the same suspicion, as when a student’s lab report contains data that are exactly as the theory predicts. The laboratory instructor knows that the accuracy of the equipment and the student’s laboratory technique are not good enough to give such perfect results. He suspects that the student made them up. Here are just two examples about fraud in medical research.

Example 8

Fraud in medical research

In January 2018, a stem cell scientist at Kyoto University was found guilty of falsifying data for a paper that was published in Stem Cell Reports. Kyoto University asked that the paper be retracted from the journal. How did the scientist falsify data? An「investigation concluded that the lead author of the paper, Kohei Yamamizu, had fabricated all six main figures of the study, which were pivotal in the conclusions the author drew.’」

Example 9

Fraud in academic research

A classic example of false data happened in 1986. As an up-and-coming radiologist at the University of California, San Diego, Robert Slutsky appeared to publish many articles. However, when a reviewer was asked to write a letter for Slutsky’s promotion, the reviewer discovered that two articles written by Slutsky had the exact same data, but with different numbers of subjects. Needless to say, Slutsky did not get a promotion—in fact, he resigned.

In the Slutsky case, suspicious regularity (exact same data) combined with inconsistency (different numbers of subjects) led a careful reader to suspect fraud.

Is the Arithmetic Right?

Conclusions that are wrong or just incomprehensible are often the result of small arithmetic errors. Rates and percentages cause particular trouble.

Statistics in Your World

Just a little arithmetic mistake In 1994, an investment club of grandmotherly women wrote a best-seller, The Beardstown Ladies’ Common-Sense Investment Guide: How We Beat the Stock Market—and How You Can, Too. On the book cover and in their many TV appearances, the down-home authors claimed a 23.4% annual return, beating the market and most professionals. Four years later, a skeptic discovered that the club treasurer had entered data incorrectly. The Beardstown ladies’ true return was only 9.1%, far short of the overall stock market return of 14.9% in the same period. We all make mistakes, but most of them don’t earn as much money as this one did.

Example 10

Oh, those percents

Here are a couple of examples involving percents. During the December 4, 2009, episode of the TV show Fox & Friends, a graphic was displayed with the question heading:「Did scientists falsify research to support their own theories on global warming?」The results, attributed to a Rasmussen Reports Poll on global warming, indicated that 59% of people believed this was「somewhat likely,」35% thought it was「very likely,」and 26% considered it「not very likely.」That adds up to a whopping 120% of those polled! Turns out that Fox & Friends misquoted the actual Rasmussen Reports Poll results but didn’t notice the error.

Even smart people have problems with percentages. A newsletter for female university teachers asked,「Does it matter that women are 550% (five and a half times) less likely than men to be appointed to a professional grade?」Now 100% of something is all there is. If you take away 100%, there is nothing left. We have no idea what「550% less likely」might mean. Although we can’t be sure, it is possible that the newsletter meant that the likelihood for women is the likelihood for men divided by 5.5. In this case, the percentage decrease would be

Arithmetic is a skill that is easily lost if not used regularly. Fortunately, those who continue to do arithmetic are less likely to be taken in by meaningless numbers. A little thought and a calculator go a long way.

Example 11

Summertime is burglary time

An advertisement for a home security system says,「When you go on vacation, burglars go to work. According to FBI statistics, over 26% of home burglaries take place between Memorial Day and Labor Day.」

This is supposed to convince us that burglars are more active in the summer vacation period. Look at your calendar. There are 14 weeks between Memorial Day and Labor Day. As a percentage of the 52 weeks in the year, this is

So the ad claims that 26% of burglaries occur in 27% of the year. This seems to make sense, so there is no cause for concern.

Example 12

The old folks are coming

A writer in Science claimed in 1976 that「people over 65, now numbering 10 million, will number 30 million by the year 2000, and will constitute an unprecedented 25 percent of the population.」Sound the alarm: the elderly were going to triple in a quarter century to become a fourth of the population.

Let’s check the arithmetic. Thirty million is 25% of 120 million, because

So the writer’s numbers make sense only if the population in 2000 is 120 million. The U.S. population in 1975 was already 216 million. Something is wrong.

Thus alerted, we can check the Statistical Abstract of the United States to learn the truth. In 1975, there were 22.4 million people over age 65, not 10 million. That’s more than 10% of the total population. The estimate of 30 million by the year 2000 was only about 11% of the population of 281 million for that year. Looking back, we now know that people at least 65 years old were 12% of the total U.S. population. As people live longer, the numbers of the elderly are growing. But growth from 10% to 12% over 25 years is far slower than the Science writer claimed.

Calculating the percentage increase or decrease in some quantity seems particularly prone to mistakes. The percentage change in a quantity is found by

Example 13

Stocks go up, stocks go down

On March 26, 2018, the NASDAQ composite index of stock prices closed at 7220.54 with its ninth largest point increase of 227.87. The NASDAQ composite index closed at 6992.60 the previous day. What percentage increase was this?

Of course, stock prices go down as well as up. The very next day, the NASDAQ composite index of stock prices closed at 7008.81 with its ninth largest point decrease of 211.73. According to NASDAQ’s stock market news,「Fears of an ensuing trade war between the U.S. and China led to grievous losses for the benchmarks on Friday… . Further, technology stocks, which have been driving the markets this year as well as in 2017, took a massive hit.」

That’s a percentage decrease of

Remember to always use the starting value, not the smaller value, in the denominator of your fraction. Also remember that you are interested in the percentage change, not the actual change (here, the −2.9% is the correct value to report instead of the −211.73 difference).

Now it’s your turn

9.2 Percentage increase and decrease. Dejah earned $100,000 last year at her startup and wants to prepare for potential lean times. She plans to take a 20% salary decrease next year and will then take a 20% increase in the second year. One of her friends says,「That’s not bad, Dejah. You will be back to your original salary in two years.」Help Dejah explain to her friend that she will not be making her original salary in two years.

A quantity can increase by any amount—a 100% increase just means it has doubled. But nothing can go down more than 100%—it has then lost 100% of its value, and 100% is all there is.

Is There a Hidden Agenda?

Lots of people feel strongly about various issues, so strongly that they would like the numbers to support their feelings. Often, they can find support in numbers by choosing carefully which numbers to report or by working hard to squeeze the numbers into the shape they prefer. Here are two examples.

Example 14

Heart disease in women

A highway billboard says simply,「Half of all heart disease victims are women.」What might be the agenda behind this true statement? Perhaps the billboard sponsors just want to make women aware that they do face risks from heart disease. (Surveys show that many women underestimate the risk of heart disease.)

On the other hand, perhaps the sponsors want to fight what some people see as an overemphasis on male heart disease. In that case, we might want to know that although half of heart disease victims are women, they are on the average much older than male victims. Roughly 50,000 women under age 65 and 100,000 men under age 65 die from heart disease each year. The American Heart Association says,「Risk of death due to coronary heart disease in women is roughly similar to that of men 10 years younger.」

Example 15

Income inequality

During the economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, the gap between the highest and lowest earners widened. In 1980, the bottom fifth of households received 4.3% of all income, and the top fifth received 43.7%. By 1998, the share of the bottom fifth had fallen to 3.6% of all income, and the share of the top fifth of households had risen to 49.2%. That is, the top fifth’s share was almost 14 times the bottom fifth’s share.

Can we massage the numbers to make it appear that the income gap is smaller than it actually is? An article in Forbes (an American business magazine) tried. First, according to data from the Current Population Survey, household income tends to be larger for larger households, so let’s change to income per person. The rich pay more taxes, so look at income after taxes. The poor receive food stamps and other assistance, so let’s count that. Finally, high earners work more hours than low earners, so we should adjust for hours worked. After all this, the share of the top fifth is only three times that of the bottom fifth. Of course, hours worked are reduced by illness, disability, care of children and aged parents, and so on. If Forbes’s hidden agenda is to show that income inequality isn’t important, we may not agree.

Yet other adjustments are possible. Income, in these U.S. Census Bureau figures, does not include capital gains from, for example, selling stocks that have gone up. Almost all capital gains go to the rich, so including them would widen the income gap. Forbes didn’t make this adjustment. Making every imaginable adjustment in the meaning of「income,」says the U.S. Census Bureau, gives the bottom fifth of households 4.7% of total income in 1998 and the top fifth 45.8%.

The gap between the highest and lowest earners continues to widen. In 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the bottom fifth of households received 3.1% of all income and the top fifth received 51.5%, with the top 5 percent of households receiving 22.6% of all income.

Chapter 9 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 9: Statistics in Summary

Pay attention to self-reported statistics. Ask exactly what a number measures and decide if it is a valid measure.

Look for the context of the numbers and ask if there is important missing information.

Look for inconsistencies, numbers that don’t agree as they should, and check for incorrect arithmetic.

Compare numbers that are implausible—surprisingly large or small—with numbers you know are right.

Be suspicious when numbers are too regular or agree too well with what their author would like to see.

Look with special care if you suspect the numbers are put forward in support of some hidden agenda.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

In Chapters 1 through 8, we have seen that we should always ask how the data were produced and exactly what was measured. Both affect the quality of any conclusions drawn. The goal is to gain insight by means of the numbers that make up our data. Numbers are most likely to yield insights to those who examine them properly. We need to develop「number sense,」the habit of asking if the numbers make sense. To assist you, in this chapter we have provided you with examples of bad data and of good data used wrongly. If you form the habit of looking at numbers properly, your friends will soon think that you are brilliant. They might even be right.

Case Study Evaluated

Use what you have learned in this chapter to evaluate the Case Study that opened the chapter. Start by reviewing the Chapter Summary. Then communicate clearly enough for any of your classmates to understand what you are saying.

How were the crowd sizes for the 2017 U.S. Presidential Inauguration and the Women’s March on Washington calculated? We don’t know how the estimates were made by either President Trump or the organizers of the Women’s March. However, crowd scientists estimate that the crowd at the「women’s march in Washington was roughly three times the size of the audience at President Trump’s inauguration.」By analyzing photographs and video, crowd scientists estimate the actual attendances as about 170,000 at the inauguration and about 460,000 at the Women’s March. For more information, use the Internet to find out more about crowd science.

In this chapter you have:

Check the Basics

For Exercise 9.1, see page 190; for Exercise 9.2, see page 194.

9.3 Academic good standing. To be in good standing at college, a student needs to maintain a certain grade point average (GPA). Typically, a student who falls below 2.0 is put on academic probation for at least a semester. At a local college, administrators wanted to increase the GPA to remain in good standing from 2.0 and reported that the anticipated increase of students on probation would be from 3% to 5% of the student body. Relatively speaking, the increase in the percentage of students at the college who would be on academic probation would be

2% over the current figure.

40% over the current figure.

67% over the current figure.

We cannot determine the percentage increase because we do not know how many students attend the college.

9.4 HIV infection rates. According to a June 2015 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in eight Americans with HIV do not know that they are infected with the virus. The night the report was released, a news station reported「1 in 8 Americans do not know that they are infected with HIV.」What is wrong with the news station’s reporting? [Note: More than one answer is possible.]

Nothing is wrong. The news station reported exactly the information it should have.

The news station’s report implies that one in eight Americans is infected with HIV.

The news station’s report implies that one in eight Americans who have not been tested for HIV actually is infected with HIV.

The news station’s report omitted the important piece of information that the one in eight figure is for those who are infected with HIV.

9.5 Decreasing household trash. A large city has started a new recycling program that aims to reduce household trash by 25% by educating residents about more household items that can be recycled. A friend of yours says,「This is great! The amount of recycling will increase by 25%. That’s a great start!」What is wrong with your friend’s comment?

Your friend assumed that the amount of trash and the amount of recycling was equal to begin with.

We know that a 25% reduction in household trash will result in less than a 25% increase in recycling.

We know that a 25% reduction in household trash will result in more than a 25% increase in recycling.

None of the above.

9.6 Increasing test scores. The average score on an exam in organic chemistry was 60. The professor gave a retest and reported that the average score on the exam increased by 25%. This means that the average score on the retest was

45.

75.

85.

It is impossible to know without having all of the scores from the retest.

9.7 Classes on Fridays. A professor is concerned that not enough courses at his college hold class meetings on Fridays. After speaking with administrators, the professor finds out that 15% of courses have class meetings on Fridays. At this school, classes meet on either Monday-Wednesday-Friday or Tuesday-Thursday and do not meet on Saturday or Sunday.

The 15% figure is about right because Friday is one of seven days of the week.

The 15% figure is low because it is less than 20%, and Friday is one of five days on which classes meet.

We cannot make a decision about the 15% figure because we do not know how courses are divided among teaching days (e.g., Monday- Wednesday-Friday or Tuesday-Thursday).

The 15% figure is high because students tend to skip classes on Fridays.

Chapter 9 Exercises

9.8 Drunk driving. A newspaper article on drunk driving cited data on traffic deaths in Rhode Island:「Forty-two percent of all fatalities occurred on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, apparently because of increased drinking on the weekends.」What percent of the week do Friday, Saturday, and Sunday make up? Are you surprised that 42% of fatalities occur on those days?

9.9 Advertising painkillers. Shortly after its release, an advertisement for the pain reliever Tylenol was headlined「Why Doctors Recommend Tylenol More Than All Leading Aspirin Brands Combined.」The makers of Bayer Aspirin, in a reply headlined「Makers of Tylenol, Shame on You!」accused Tylenol of misleading by giving the truth but not the whole truth. You be the detective. How was Tylenol’s claim misleading even if true?

9.10 Play fantasy sports and win. FanDuel and DraftKings are two popular fantasy sports providers that allow players to bet and (possibly) win money. Prior to a 2016 lawsuit against both providers, commercials about how you could win a lot of money with FanDuel or DraftKings were rampant. According to a Fortune article, the ads「implied that all fantasy sports players, regardless of resources and experience, had the same chance of winning—and winning big.」The article went on to say that「in reality, just a small percentage of professional players with research, software, and large bankrolls won the majority of the jackpot.」If FanDuel and DraftKings continued advertising as they were without disclosing their terms, conditions, expected winnings, and fees, how might people watching the commercials be misled?

9.11 Deer in the suburbs. Westchester County is a suburban area covering 438 square miles immediately north of New York City. A garden magazine claimed that the county is home to 800,000 deer. Do a calculation that shows this claim to be implausible.

9.12 Suicides among Vietnam veterans. Did the horrors of fighting in Vietnam drive many veterans of that war to suicide? A figure of 150,000 suicides among Vietnam veterans in the 20 years following the end of the war has been widely quoted. Explain why this number is not plausible. To help you, here are some facts: about 20,000 to 25,000 American men commit suicide each year; about 3 million men served in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War; there were roughly 93 million adult men in the United States 20 years after the war.

9.13 Trash at sea? A report on the problem of vacation cruise ships polluting the sea by dumping garbage overboard said:

On a seven-day cruise, a medium-size ship (about 1,000 passengers) might accumulate 222,000 coffee cups, 72,000 soda cans, 40,000 beer cans and bottles, and 11,000 wine bottles.

Are these numbers plausible? Do some arithmetic to back up your conclusion. Suppose, for example, that the crew is as large as the passenger list. How many cups of coffee must each person drink every day?

9.14 Funny numbers. Here’s a quotation from a book review in a scientific journal:

… a set of 20 studies with 57 percent reporting significant results, of which 42 percent agree on one conclusion while the remaining 15 percent favor another conclusion, often the opposite one.

Do the numbers given in this quotation make sense? Can you determine how many of the 20 studies agreed on「one conclusion,」how many favored another conclusion, and how many did not report significant results?

9.15 Airport delays. An article in a midwestern newspaper about flight delays at major airports said:

According to a Gannett News Service study of U.S. airlines’ performance during the past five months, Chicago’s O’Hare Field scheduled 114,370 flights. Nearly 10 percent, 1,136, were canceled.

Check the newspaper’s arithmetic. What percent of scheduled flights from O’Hare were actually canceled?

9.16 How many miles do we drive? Here is an excerpt from Robert Sullivan’s「A Slow-Road Movement?」in the Sunday magazine section of the New York Times on June 25, 2006:

In 1956, Americans drove 628 million miles; in 2002, 2.8 billion… . In 1997, according to the Department of Transportation, the Interstate System handled more than 1 trillion ton-miles of stuff, a feat executed by 21 million truckers driving approximately 412 billion miles.

There were at least 100 million drivers in the United States in 2002. How many miles per driver per year is 2.8 billion miles? Does this seem plausible?

According to the report, on average, how many miles per year do truckers drive? Does this seem plausible?

Check the most recent Statistical Abstract of the United States at www.census.gov and determine how many miles per year Americans actually drive.

9.17 Battered women? A letter to the editor of the New York Times complained about a Times editorial that said「an American woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend every 15 seconds.」The writer of the letter claimed that「at that rate, 21 million women would be beaten by their husbands or boyfriends every year. That is simply not the case.」He cited the National Crime Victimization Survey, which estimated 56,000 cases of violence against women by their husbands and 198,000 by boyfriends or former boyfriends. The survey showed 2.2 million assaults against women in all, most by strangers or someone the woman knew who was not her past or present husband or boyfriend.

First do the arithmetic. Every 15 seconds is 4 per minute. At that rate, how many beatings would take place in an hour? In a day? In a year? Is the letter writer’s arithmetic correct?

Is the letter writer correct to claim that the Times overstated the number of cases of domestic violence against women?

9.18 We can read, but can we count? The U.S. Census Bureau once gave a simple test of literacy in English to a random sample of 3400 people. The New York Times printed some of the questions under the headline「113% of Adults in U.S. Failed This Test.」Why is the percent in the headline clearly wrong?

9.19 Stocks go down. On February 5, 2018, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1175 points from its opening level of 25,521. This was the biggest one-day point decline ever. By what percentage did the Dow drop that day? On October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 508 points from its opening level of 2245. By what percentage did the Dow drop that day? This was the biggest one-day percentage drop ever.

9.20 Poverty. The number of Americans living below the official poverty line increased from 35,574,000 to 39,698,000 in the 20 years between 1997 and 2017. What percentage increase was this? You should not conclude from these values alone that poverty became more common during this time period. Why not?

9.21 Reducing emissions. An online article reported the following:

In order to limit warming to two degrees Celsius and permit development, several developed countries would have to reduce their emissions by more than 100 percent.

Explain carefully why it is impossible to reduce anything by more than 100%.

9.22 Are men more promiscuous? Are men more promiscuous by nature than women? Surveys seem to bear this out, with men reporting more sexual partners than women.

On August 12, 2007, the New York Times reported the following.

One survey, recently reported by the U.S. government, concluded that men had a median of seven female sex partners. Women had a median of four male sex partners. Another study, by British researchers, stated that men had 12.7 heterosexual partners in their lifetimes and women had 6.5.

There is one mathematical problem with these results. What is this problem?

9.23 Don’t dare to drive? In early 2019 several media outlets reported new statistics from the National Safety Council that revealed that, for the first time in history, Americans are more likely to die from an accidental opioid overdose than from motor vehicle crashes. According to the NSC,

The odds of dying accidentally from an opioid overdose have risen to one in 96, eclipsing the odds of dying in a motor vehicle crash (one in 103).

Should you be worried about your chance of dying in a motor vehicle accident this year? To answer this question, use the facts that there are about 327 million people in the United States and there are about 48,000 motor vehicle deaths per year. What is the chance a typical person will die in a motor vehicle accident this year?

9.24 How many miles of highways? Organic Gardening magazine once said that「the U.S. Interstate Highway System spans 3.9 million miles and is wearing out 50% faster than it can be fixed. Continuous road deterioration adds $7 billion yearly in fuel costs to motorists.」The distance from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States is about 3000 miles. How many separate highways across the continent would be needed to account for 3.9 million miles of roads? What do you conclude about the number of miles in the interstate system?

9.25 In the garden. Organic Gardening magazine, describing how to improve your garden’s soil, said,「Since a 6-inch layer of soil in a 100-square-foot plot weighs about 45,000 pounds, adding 230 pounds of compost will give you an instant 5% organic matter.」

What percent of 45,000 is 230?

Water weighs about 62 pounds per cubic foot. There are 50 cubic feet in a garden layer 100 square feet in area and 6 inches deep. What would 50 cubic feet of water weigh? Is it plausible that 50 cubic feet of soil weighs 45,000 pounds?

It appears from part (b) that the 45,000 pounds isn’t right. In fact, soil weighs about 75 pounds per cubic foot. If we use the correct weight, is the「5% organic matter」conclusion roughly correct?

9.26 No eligible men? A news report quotes a sociologist as saying that for every 233 unmarried women in their 40s in the United States, there are only 100 unmarried men in their 40s. These numbers point to an unpleasant social situation for women of that age. Are the numbers plausible? (Optional: The Statistical Abstract of the United States has a table titled「Marital status of the population by age and sex」that gives the actual counts.)

9.27 Too good to be true? The late English psychologist Cyril Burt was known for his studies of the IQ scores of identical twins who were raised apart. The high correlation between the IQs of separated twins in Burt’s studies pointed to heredity as a major factor in IQ. (「Correlation」measures how closely two variables are connected. We will meet correlation in Chapter 14.) Burt wrote several accounts of his work, adding more pairs of twins over time. Here are his reported correlations as he published them:

Publication date Twins reared apart Twins reared together

1955 0.771 (21 pairs) 0.944 (83 pairs)

1966 0.771 (53 pairs) 0.944 (95 pairs)

What is suspicious here?

9.28 Where you start matters. When comparing numbers over time, you can slant the comparison by choosing your starting point. Say the Chicago Cubs lose five games, then win four, then lose one. You can truthfully say that the Cubs have lost 6 of their last 10 games (sounds bad) or that they have won 4 of their last 5 (sounds good).

The following example can also be used to make numbers sound bad or good. The median income of American households (in dollars of 2017 buying power) was $56,533 in 1997, $59,534 in 2007, and $61,372 in 2017. All three values are in dollars of 2017 buying power, which allows us to compare the numbers directly. By what percentage did household income increase between 1997 and 2017? Between 2007 and 2017? You see that you can make the income trend sound bad or good by choosing your starting point.

9.29 Being on top also matters. The previous exercise noted that median household income increased slightly between 2007 and 2017. The top 5% of households earned $209,773 or more in 2007 and $237,034 or more in 2017. It is important to note that these amounts are both in dollars of 2017 buying power, which allows us to compare the numbers directly. By what percentage did the income of top earners increase between 2007 and 2017? How does this compare with the percentage increase in median household income between 2007 and 2017?

9.30 Boating safety. Data on accidents in recreational boating in the U.S. Coast Guard’s Recreational Boating Statistics Report show that the number of deaths has dropped from 685 in 2007 to 658 in 2017. The number of injuries reported also fell from 3673 in 2007 to 2629 in 2017. Why does it make sense that the number of deaths in these data is less than number of injuries? Which count (deaths or injuries) is probably more accurate?

9.31 Obesity and income. An article in the November 3, 2009, issue of the Guardian reported,「A separate opinion poll yesterday suggested that 50% of obese people earn less than the national average income.」Income has a distribution that is such that more than 50% of all workers would earn less than the national average. Is this evidence that obese people tend to earn less than other workers?

PART I Review

The first and most important question to ask about any statistical study is「Where do the data come from?」Chapter 1 addressed this question. The distinction between observational and experimental data is a key part of the answer. Good statistics starts with good designs for producing data. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 discussed sampling, the art of choosing part of a population to represent the whole. Figure I.1 summarizes the big idea of a simple random sample. Chapters 5 and 6 dealt with the statistical aspects of designing experiments, studies that impose some treatment in order to learn about the response. The big idea is the randomized comparative experiment. Figure I.2 outlines the simplest design.

Random sampling and randomized comparative experiments are perhaps the most important statistical inventions of the twentieth century. Both were slow to gain acceptance, and you will still see many voluntary response samples and uncontrolled experiments. Both random samples and randomized experiments involve the deliberate use of chance to eliminate bias and produce a regular pattern of outcomes. The regular pattern allows us to give margins of error, make confidence statements, and assess the statistical significance of conclusions based on samples or experiments.

Figure I.1 The idea of a simple random sample.

An arrow points from Population to Sample data x 1, x 2, to x n; the arrow is labeled All samples of size n are equally likely.

Figure I.2 The idea of a randomized comparative experiment.

Two arrows point from Random allocation to Group 1, n 1 subjects and Group 2, n 2 subjects. An arrow points from Group 1, n 1 subjects to Treatment 1, while another arrow points from Group 2, n 2 subjects to Treatment 2. Arrows from both Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 lead to Compare response.

When we collect data about people, ethical issues can be important. Chapter 7 discussed these issues and introduced three principles that apply to any study with human subjects. The last step in producing data is to measure the characteristics of interest to produce numbers we can work with. Measurement was the subject of Chapter 8.「Where do the data come from?」is the first question we should ask about a study, and「Do the numbers make sense?」is the second. Chapter 9 encouraged the valuable habit of looking skeptically at numbers before accepting what they seem to say.

I.3 A Twitter poll. In July 2018, CSPAN ran a poll on Twitter in which they asked,「Do you SUPPORT or OPPOSE the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court?」The final result was 54% SUPPORT, 39% OPPOSE, and 7% UNDECIDED. The number of votes received was 42, 145. Explain why these sample results are almost certainly biased. (Hint: See pages 22–24.)

I.4 Select an SRS. A student at a large universitywants to study the responses that students receive when calling an academic department for information. She selects an SRS of four departments from the following list for her study. Use the Simple Random Sample applet, other software, or Table A, starting at line 115 to do this.

Accounting Electrical Engineering Natural Resources

Architecture Elementary Education Nursing

Art English Pharmacy

Biology Foreign Languages Philosophy

Business Administration History Physics

Chemistry Horticulture Political Science

Communication International Studies Pre-Med

Computer Science Marketing Psychology

Dance Mathematics Sociology

Economics Music Veterinary Science

I.5 Select an SRS. An outside review team is visiting the history department to assess the quality of its undergraduate major. The department chair wants to select four senior undergraduate majors to meet with the review team. She decides to select these four students by taking an SRS of size 4 from the list of all 30 senior undergraduate history majors. Use the Simple Random Sample applet, other software, or Table A, starting at line 128 to draw an SRS of size 4 from the following 30 undergraduate history majors.

Anis Frazier Lehman Murphy Utlaut

Atlas Gardner Leonard Pagolu Valente

Bailey Guthrie Mee Ramsey Weese

Banks Kowalski Michelson Ray Wendelberger

Edwards Kupka Morgan Sall Woodall

Foyston Laperriere Mosienko Sawchuk Yzerman

(Hint: See pages 24–29.)

I.6 Errors in surveys. Give an example of a source of nonsampling error in a sample survey. Then give an example of a source of sampling error.

I.7 Errors in surveys. An overnight opinion poll calls randomly selected telephone numbers. This polling method misses all people without a phone. Is this a source of nonsampling error or of sampling error? Does the poll’s announced margin of error take this source of error into account? (Hint: See pages 64–65.)

I.8 Errors in surveys. A college chooses an SRS of 100 students from the registrar’s list of all undergraduates to interview about student life. If it selected two SRSs of 100 students at the same time, the two samples would give somewhat different results. Is this variation a source of sampling error or of nonsampling error? Does the survey’s announced margin of error take this source of error into account?

I.9 Errors in surveys. Exercises I.7 and I.8 each mention a source of error in a sample survey. Would each kind of error be reduced by doubling the size of the sample with no other changes in the survey procedures? Explain your answers. (Hint: See pages 45–48 and pages 61–65.)

I.10 Errors in surveys. A Gallup Poll found that 46% of American smartphone users agree with the statement,「I can’t imagine my life without my smartphone.」The Gallup press release says:

Results of attitudes and behaviors of smartphone usage are based on 15,747 members of the Gallup Panel who have smartphones … For results based on this sample, one can say that the margin of sampling error is percentage point at the 95% confidence level.

The release also points out that this margin of error is due only to sampling error. Give one example of a source of error in the poll result that is not included in this margin of error.

I.11 Find the margin of error. Accelerating Acceptance 2018 was published by GLAAD with the results of surveys conducted by the Harris Poll in November 2017. The Accelerating Acceptance report is the「first-of-its-kind index to measure American attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people and issues.」For the first time since its original publication four years before, GLAAD found an increase in non-LGBTQ people who were uncomfortable around their LGBTQ counterparts in certain situations. Of the 1897 randomly sampled non-LGBT adults, 31% reported they were「very」or「somewhat」uncomfortable seeing a same-sex couple holding hands.

What is the population for this 2017 survey? (Hint: See pages 8–11.)

Assuming the 2017 survey used random sampling, use the quick and approximate method to find a margin of error. Then give a complete confidence statement for a conclusion about the population. (Hint: See pages 43–44.)

I.12 Find the margin of error. The Accelerating Acceptance report mentioned in Exercise I.11 also found an increase in discrimination against LGBTQ people. A majority, 55%, of LGBTQ persons reported having experienced discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This was based on 263 randomly selected LGBTQ people.

What is the population for this sample survey?

Assuming the sample was a random sample, use the quick and approximate method to find a margin of error. Make a confidence statement about the opinion of the population.

Explain why there is a difference in the size of the margin of error you calculated in this exercise when compared to the margin of error from Exercise I.11.

I.13 What kind of sample? At a party, there are 30 students over age 21 and 20 students under age 21. You choose at random 6 of those over 21 and separately choose at random 4 of those under 21 to interview about attitudes toward alcohol. You have given every student at the party the same chance to be interviewed: What is that chance? Why is your sample not an SRS? What is this kind of sample called? (Hint: See pages 24–29 and pages 68–72.)

I.14 Design an experiment. A university’s Department of Statistics wants to attract more majors. It prepares two advertising brochures. Brochure A stresses the intellectual excitement of statistics. Brochure B stresses how much money statisticians make. Which will be more attractive to first-year students? You have a questionnaire to measure interest in majoring in statistics, and you have 50 first-year students to work with. Outline the design of an experiment to decide which brochure works better.

I.15 Design an experiment. Gary and Greg disagree on which burger chain makes the best fries. Gary likes McDonald’s fries but Greg prefers Burger King’s. Gary and Greg recruit 20 friends who are willing to participate in a taste test. Outline the design of an experiment to decide which burger chain makes the best fries. (Hint: See pages 92–94.)

Exercises I.16 to I.19 are based on an article in the Lancet that investigates the use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events. This study is related to the Physicians’ Health Study discussed in Exercise 5.11. The clinical trial discussed in the article was randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled and was administered in a total of seven countries between 2007 and 2016. A total of 12,546 participants (at least age 55 for men and at least age 60 for women) were involved in the trial. Subjects were randomized into one of two groups, with 6270 subjects in the aspirin group and 6276 subjects in the placebo group. According to the Lancet article,「The overall incidence rate of serious adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, 20.19% in the aspirin group versus 20.89% in the placebo group. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, 82.01% in the aspirin group versus 81.72% in the placebo group.」

I.16 Know these terms. Explain in one sentence each what「randomized,「「double-blind,」「placebo-controlled,」and「clinical trial」mean in the description of the design of the study.

I.17 Experiment basics. Identify the subjects, the explanatory variable, and several response variables for this study. (Hint: See pages 89–93.)

I.18 Design an experiment. Use a diagram to outline the design of the experiment in this medical study.

I.19 Ethics. What are the three first principles of data ethics? Explain briefly what the medical study must do to apply each of these principles. (Hint: See pages 135–137.)

I.20 Measuring. Joni wants to measure the degree to which male college students belong to the political left. She decides simply to measure the length of their hair—longer hair will mean more left-wing.

Is this method likely to be reliable? Why?

This measurement appears to be invalid. Why?

Nevertheless, it is possible that measuring politics by hair length might have some predictive validity. Explain how this could happen.

I.21 Reliability. You are laboring through a chemistry laboratory assignment in which you measure the conductivity of a solution. What does it mean for your measurement to be reliable? How can you improve the reliability of your final result? (Hint: See pages 171–174.)

I.22 Observation or experiment? The Nurses’ Health Study has queried a sample of more than 100,000 female registered nurses every two years since 1976. Beginning in 1980, the study asked questions about diet, including alcohol consumption. The researchers concluded that「light-to-moderate drinkers had a significantly lower risk of death」than either nondrinkers or heavy drinkers.

Is the Nurses’ Health Study an observational study or an experiment? Why?

What does「significant」mean in a statistical report?

Suggest some lurking variables that might explain why moderate drinkers have lower death rates than nondrinkers. (The study did adjust for these variables.)

I.23 Observation or experiment? Can medical cannabis combat the opioid epidemic? An online article in Leafly describes a study conducted by scientists at the University of New Mexico. The study compared opioid use by a group of patients with chronic back pain. Some of these patients had been enrolled in New Mexico’s Medical Cannabis Program. Others were not. Researchers found that 84% of patients who received access to medical cannabis reduced their opioid prescriptions, compared to 45% in the comparison group. Notably, 41% of the cannabis users stopped using opioids altogether.

Is this an observational study or an experiment? Why? (Hint: See pages 7–8 and 12–13.)

We cannot conclude that medical cannabis causes a reduction in opioid use. Suggest other relationships among these variables and perhaps lurking variables that might explain the reduction in opioid use by cannabis users. (Hint: See pages 4–6, 7–8, and 90.) https://www.leafly.com/news/health/the-top-medical-cannabis-studies-of-2017

I.24 Percents up and down. Between October 14, 2017, and October 14, 2018, the average price of regular gasoline increased from $2.46 per gallon to $2.90 per gallon.

Verify that this is almost an 18% increase in price.

If the price of gasoline decreases by 18% from its October 14, 2018, level of $2.90 per gallon, what would be the new price? Notice that an 18% increase followed by an 18% decrease does not take us back to the starting point.

I.25 Percentage decrease. On Monday, September 10, 2001 (the day before the September 11 attacks), the NASDAQ stock index closed the day at 1695. By the end of Monday, September 17, 2001 (the first full day of trading after the attacks), the NASDAQ stock index had dropped to 1580. By what percentage did the index drop? (Hint: See pages 191–194.)

I.26 An implausible number? Newsweek once said in a story that a woman who is not currently married at age 40 has a better chance of being killed by a terrorist than of getting married. Do you think this is plausible? What kind of data would help you check this claim?

Part projects

Projects are longer exercises that require gathering information or producing data and that emphasize writing a short essay to describe your work. Many are suitable for teams of students.

PART II Organizing Data

Words alone don’t tell a story. A writer organizes words into sentences and organizes the sentences into a story line. If the words are badly organized, the story isn’t clear. Data also need organizing if they are to tell a clear story. Too many words obscure a subject rather than illuminate it. Vast amounts of data are even harder to digest—we often need a brief summary to highlight essential facts. How to organize, summarize, and present data are our topics in the second part of this book.

Organizing and summarizing a large body of facts opens the door to distortions, both unintentional and deliberate. This is no less (but also no more) the case when the facts take the form of numbers rather than words. We will point out some of the traps that data presentations can set for the unwary. Those who picture statistics as primarily a piece of the liar’s art concentrate on the part of statistics that deals with summarizing and presenting data. We claim that misleading summaries and selective presentations go back to that after-the-apple conversation among Adam, Eve, and God. Don’t blame statistics. Do remember the saying「Figures won’t lie, but liars will figure,」and beware.

CHAPTER 10 Graphs, Good and Bad
