See how to question whether measurements are valid or accurate.

Consider how we can improve reliability and reduce bias.

Case Study: Measuring Intelligence

Are people with larger brains more intelligent? People have investigated this question throughout history. To answer it, we must measure「intelligence.」This requires us to reduce a complex construct to a number that can go up or down. The first step is to specify what we mean by intelligence. Does a vast knowledge of many subjects constitute intelligence? How about the ability to solve difficult puzzles or do complicated mathematical calculations? Or is it some combination of these?

Once we decide what intelligence is, we must actually produce the numbers. Should we use the score on a written test? Maybe we could collect data online from people who click on a link that promises them an answer to「Which celebrities have your same IQ?" Perhaps a formula that also includes grades in school would be better. Not only is it hard to say exactly what「intelligence」is, but it’s hard to attach a number to measure whatever we say it is. And in the end, can we even trust the number we produce? The material in this chapter will provide you with the tools to address the Case Study and will help you understand the process of measurement and determine whether you can trust the resulting numbers.

Measurement Basics

Statistics deals with data, and the data may or may not be numbers. For example, planning the production of data through a sample or an experiment does not by itself produce numbers. Once we have our sample respondents or our experimental subjects, we must still measure whatever characteristics interest us. First, think broadly: Are we trying to measure the right things? Are we overlooking some outcomes that are important even though they may be hard to measure?

Example 1

Saving lives and money

A recent study of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) investigated the impact of a program on survival rates and treatment costs. As reported, the Coaching On Achieving Cardiovascular Health (COACH) Program improved both biomedical and lifestyle CVD risk factors. The study focused on measuring the long-term impact of the COACH Program on overall survival and hospital costs in patients with CVD. The researchers needed to determine how to measure both survival and hospital costs for the patients with CVD who participated in the study.

Once we have decided what properties we want to measure, we can think about how to do the measurements.

Measurement basics

We measure a property of a person or thing when we assign a value to represent the property.

We often use an instrument to make a measurement. We may have a choice of the units we use to record the measurements.

The result of measurement is a numerical variable that takes different values for people or things that differ in whatever we are measuring.

Example 2

Length, college readiness, highway safety

To measure the length of a room, you can use a digital laser measuring device as the instrument. You can choose either feet or meters as the unit of measurement. If you choose meters, your variable is the length of the room in meters.

To measure a student’s readiness for college, you might ask the student to take the SAT exam. The exam is the instrument. The variable is the student’s score in points, somewhere between 400 and 1600 if you combine the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and the Mathematics sections of the SAT.「Points」are the units of measurement, but these are determined by a complicated scoring system described at the SAT website (www.collegeboard.com).

How can you measure the safety of traveling on the highway? You might decide to use the number of people who die in motor vehicle accidents in a year as a variable to measure highway safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) collects data on all fatal traffic crashes. The unit of measurement is the number of people who died, and the FARS serves as our measuring instrument.

Statistics in Your World

What are your units? Not paying attention to units of measurement can get you into trouble. This example may seem old to you, but it is a classic example of issues with measurement. In 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter burned up in the Martian atmosphere. It was supposed to be 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the planet’s surface but was, in fact, only 35 miles (57 kilometers) above the surface. It seems that Lockheed Martin, which built the Orbiter, specified important measurements in English units (pounds, miles). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration team, who flew the Orbiter, thought the numbers were in metric system units (kilograms, kilometers). There went $125 million, which is about $189 million in 2018.

Here are some questions you should ask about the variables in any statistical study:

Exactly how is the variable defined?

Is the variable an accurate way to describe the property it claims to measure?

How dependable are the measurements?

We don’t often design our own measuring devices—we use the results of the SAT or the FARS, for example—so we won’t go deeply into that aspect of measurement. Any consumer of numbers, however, should know a bit about how those numbers are produced.

Know Your Variables

Measurement is the process of turning concepts like length or employment status into precisely defined variables. Using a digital laser measuring device to turn the idea of「length」into a number is straightforward because we know exactly what we mean by length. Measuring college readiness is controversial because it isn’t clear exactly what makes a student ready for college. Using SAT scores at least says exactly how we will get numbers, but does it take into account all aspects that make a person「ready" for college? Measuring free time requires that we first say what activities count as「free" time. Even counting highway deaths requires us to say exactly what counts as a highway death: Pedestrians hit by cars? People in cars hit by a train at a crossing? People who die from injuries 6 months after an accident? We can simply accept the NHSTA’s counts, but someone had to answer those and other questions in order to know what to count. For example, to be included in the FARS,「a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to the public and must result in the death of at least one person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-motorist) within 30 days of the crash.」The details of when a death is counted as a highway death are necessary because they can make a difference in the data.

Example 3

Measuring unemployment

Each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announces the unemployment rate for the previous month. People who are not available for work (retired people, for example, or students who do not work while in school) should not be counted as unemployed just because they don’t have a job. To be unemployed, a person must first be in the labor force. That is, the person must be available for work and looking for work. The unemployment rate is

To complete the exact definition of the unemployment rate, the BLS has very detailed descriptions of what it means to be「in the labor force」and what it means to be「employed.」For example, if you are on strike but expect to return to the same job, you count as employed. If you are not working and did not look for work in the last four weeks, you are not in the labor force. So people who say they want to work but are too discouraged to keep looking for a job don’t count as unemployed. According to the BLS,「passive methods of job search do not have the potential to connect job seekers with potential employers and therefore do not qualify as active job search methods. Examples of passive methods include attending a job training program or course, or merely reading about [posted] job openings.」The details matter. The official unemployment rate would be different if the BLS used a different definition of unemployment.

The BLS estimates the unemployment rate based on interviews with the sample in the monthly Current Population Survey. The interviewer can’t simply ask,「Are you in the labor force?」and「Are you employed?」Many questions are needed to classify a person as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. Changing the questions can change the unemployment rate. For example, at the beginning of 1994, after several years of planning, the BLS introduced computer-assisted interviewing and improved its questions. Figure 8.1 is a graph of the unemployment rate that appeared on the front page of the BLS monthly news release on the employment situation. There is a gap in the graph before January 1994 because of this change in the interviewing process. The unemployment rate would have been 6.3% under the old system, but jumped to 6.7% under the new system. That’s a big enough difference to make politicians unhappy.

Figure 8.1 The unemployment rate from August 1991 to July 1994. The gap shows the effect of a change in how the government measures unemployment.

The data of the graph are as follows: The years 1992, 1993, and 1994 are represented along the horizontal axis. The percent of unemployment is represented along the vertical axis and its values range from 5.5 to 8.5, at an interval of 0.5. The curve originates at (1990, 6.7) and ends at (1995, 6.0). There is no curve in between the month of November, 1993 and December, 1993.

Measurements, Valid and Invalid

Key Terms

A variable is a valid measure of a property if it is relevant or appropriate as a representation of that property.

No one would object to using a digital laser measuring device reading in meters to measure the length of a room. Many people object to using SAT scores to measure readiness for college. Let’s shortcut that debate: just measure the height in meters of all applicants and accept the tallest. Bad idea, you say. Why? Because height has nothing to do with being prepared for college. In more formal language, height is not a valid measure of a student’s academic background.

It is valid to measure length with a digital laser measuring device. It isn’t valid to measure a student’s readiness for college by recording her height. The BLS unemployment rate is a valid measure, even though changes in the official definitions would give a somewhat different measure. Let’s think about measures, both valid and invalid, in some other settings.

Example 4

Measuring highway safety

Roads got better. Speed limits increased. Big SUVs and crossovers have replaced some cars, while smaller cars, hybrids, and electric vehicles have replaced others. Enforcement campaigns reduced impaired and distracted driving. How did highway safety change between 2007 and 2016 in this changing environment?

We could just count deaths from motor vehicles. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System says there were 41,259 deaths in 2007 and 37,461 deaths nine years later in 2016. The number of deaths decreased. These numbers alone show progress. However, we need to keep in mind other things that happened during this same time frame to determine how much progress has been made. For example, the number of licensed drivers rose from 206 million in 2007 to 222 million in 2016. The number of miles that people drove increased from 3031 billion to 3174 billion during this same time period. If more people drive fewer miles, should we expect more or fewer deaths? The count of deaths alone is not a valid measure of highway safety. So what should we use instead?

Rather than a count, we should use a rate. The number of deaths per mile driven takes into account the fact that more people drive more miles than in the past. In 2016, it is estimated that vehicles drove 3,174,000,000,000 miles in the United States. Because this number is so large, it is usual to measure safety by deaths per 100 million miles driven rather than deaths per mile. For 2016, this death rate is

The death rate fell from 1.4 deaths per 100 million miles in 2007 to 1.2 in 2016. That’s a decrease—there were 15% fewer deaths per mile driven in 2016 than in 2007. Driving became safer during this time period even though there were more drivers on the roads.

Now it’s your turn

8.1 Driver fatigue. A researcher studied the number of traffic accidents that were attributed to driver fatigue at different times of the day. He noticed that the number of accidents was higher in the late afternoon (between 5 and 6 P.M.) than in the early afternoon (between 1 and 2 P.M.). He concluded that driver fatigue plays a more prominent role in traffic accidents in the late afternoon than in the early afternoon. Do you think this conclusion is justified? Explain your reasoning.

Key Terms

Often a rate (a fraction, proportion, or percentage) at which something occurs is a more valid measure than a simple count of occurrences.

Using height to measure readiness for college and using counts when rates are needed are examples of clearly invalid measures. The tougher questions concern measures that are neither clearly invalid nor obviously valid.

Example 5

Assessing the validity of achievement tests

When you take a chemistry exam, you hope that it will ask you about the main points of material listed in the course syllabus. If it does, the exam is a valid measure of how much you know about the course material. The College Board, which administers the SAT, also offers Advanced Placement (AP) exams in a variety of disciplines. These AP exams are not very controversial. Experts can judge validity by comparing the test questions with the syllabus of material the questions are supposed to cover.

Example 6

Assessing the validity of IQ tests

Psychologists would like to measure aspects of the human personality that can’t be observed directly, such as「intelligence」or「authoritarian personality.」Does an IQ test measure intelligence? Some psychologists say「Yes」rather loudly. There is such a thing as general intelligence, they argue, and the various standard IQ tests do measure it, though not perfectly. For example, an adult’s general intelligence can be measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Other experts say「No」equally loudly. Famously, in the 1980s Howard Gardner proposed that there is no single intelligence, just a variety of mental abilities (for example, logical, linguistic, spatial, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal) that no one instrument can measure. And still other psychologists criticize Gardner’s approach, especially since Gardner has never developed an assessment for his multiple intelligences because he believes such experimental evidence to be inappropriate.

The disagreement over the validity of IQ tests is rooted in disagreement over the nature of intelligence. If we can’t agree on exactly what intelligence is, we can’t agree on how to measure it.

Example 7

Assessing the validity of world happiness

Each year, the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UNSDSN) publishes the「World Happiness Report.」According to the 2018 report, Finland is the happiest country, measured by Gallup World Polls from 2015–2017. (Finland’s immigrants are also the happiest of immigrant populations.) How was happiness measured? The UNSDSN bases the happiness rankings on one question that asks people from 156 countries to「rate their lives on a scale of zero to 10 – with zero being the worst possible life and 10 being the best possible life… . While the metric is known as ‘life satisfaction,’ there is some disagreement as to whether it should actually be labeled as ‘happiness’.」Many people might disagree with this way to measure happiness.

Statistics is little help in these examples. The examples start with an idea like「knowledge of chemistry」or「intelligence」or「happiness.」If the idea is vague, validity becomes a matter of opinion. However, statistics can help a lot if we refine the idea of validity a bit.

Example 8

Assessing the validity of the SAT, again

The SAT has been criticized for having both cultural and gender bias. Writing for the American Enterprise Institute, Mark J. Perry said「my main interest in the annual SAT test results is the ongoing gender gap in favor of boys for the SAT math test.」According to the College Board, in 2016, the gender gap for college-bound seniors was larger on the math part of the SAT, where women averaged 494 and men averaged 524. If we examine the average math scores by ethnicity and gender, we find that Asian or Asian American men scored the highest on the math part of the SAT, with an average of 614, while black or African American women scored the lowest on the math part of the SAT, with an average of 422.

The College Board, which administers the SAT, replies that there are many reasons some groups have lower average scores than others. For example, more women than men from families with low incomes and little education sign up for the SAT. Students whose parents have low incomes and little education have, on the average, fewer advantages at home and in school than more affluent students. They have lower SAT scores because their backgrounds have not prepared them as well for college. The mere fact of lower scores doesn’t imply that the test is not valid.

Is the SAT a valid measure of readiness for college?「Readiness for college academic work」is a vague concept that probably combines innate intelligence (whatever we decide that is), learned knowledge, study and test-taking skills, and motivation to work at academic subjects. Opinions will always differ about whether SAT scores (or any other measure) accurately reflect this vague concept.

Key Terms

A measurement of a property has predictive validity if it can be used to predict success on tasks that are related to the property measured.

Instead, we ask a simpler and more easily answered question: do SAT scores help predict students’ success in college? Success in college is a clear concept, measured by whether students graduate and by their college grades. Students with high SAT scores are more likely to graduate and earn (on the average) higher grades than students with low SAT scores. We say that SAT scores have predictive validity as measures of readiness for college. This is the only kind of validity that data can assess directly.

Predictive validity is the clearest and most useful form of validity from the statistical viewpoint.「Do SAT scores help predict college grades?」is a much clearer question than「Do IQ test scores measure intelligence?」However, predictive validity is not a yes-or-no idea. We must ask how accurately SAT scores predict college grades. Moreover, we must ask for what groups the SAT has predictive validity. It is possible, for example, that the SAT predicts college grades well for men but not for women. There are statistical ways to describe「how accurately.」The Statistical Controversies feature in this chapter asks you to think about these issues.

Statistical controversies

Six-Year Graduation Rates, High School GPA, and Standardized Tests

Colleges use a variety of measures to make admissions decisions. More and more colleges have gone to「test-optional」for applicants to their institutions. According to a 2018 study by the National Association for College Admission Counseling, test-optional policies (TOPs) may be「a tool [admissions offices] employed in the hope of increasing applications from a more diverse range of students.」Students who were identified as any underrepresented minority (URM) group were identified as students who would expand diversity in college enrollments. These URMs include first-generation college students, students from lower socioeconomic statuses, and students from racial and ethnic groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in college populations.

The researchers found that「a well-executed test-optional admission policy can lead to an increase in overall applications as well as an increase in the representation of URM students (both numeric and proportionate) in the applicant pool and the freshman class.」Success in college may be measured by six-year graduation rates. The following table shows the six-year college graduation rate for the relationship between high school GPA and SAT or ACT scores. Note that ACT scores have been converted into SAT score equivalents.

SAT or ACT Score

HS GPA < 800 800–890 900–990 1000–1090 >1100

<2.67 26% 32% 34% 35% 35%

2.67–3.00 29% 40% 40% 43% 39%

3.01–3.32 39% 49% 52% 54% 51%

3.33–3.66 45% 54% 58% 59% 57%

3.67–4.00 47% 62% 62% 66% 72%

How well do you think high school GPA alone predicts a college’s six-year graduation rate? How well do you think SAT or ACT scores alone predict a college’s six-year graduation rate? Do you think one measurement performs better than the other or would you suggest that they be used together? If a college becomes test optional, how do graduation rates change? Do you think the expanded diversity that comes with TOPs is worth the change in six-year graduation rates?

Measurements, Accurate and Inaccurate

Using a bathroom scale to measure your weight is valid. If your scale is like many commonly used ones, however, the measurement may not be very accurate. It measures weight, but it may not give the true weight. This can be true whether your scale is digital or analog. Let’s say that originally your scale always read 2 pounds too high, so

Statistics in Your World

What can’t be measured matters One member of the young Edmonton Oilers hockey team of 1981 finished last in almost everything one can measure: strength, speed, reflexes, eyesight. That was Wayne Gretzky, soon to be known as「the Great One.」He broke the National Hockey League (NHL) scoring record that year. Even in 2018, Gretzky holds or shares 60 NHL records. Somehow, the physical measurements didn’t catch what made Gretzky the best hockey player ever. Not everything that matters can be measured.

If that is the whole story, the scale will always give the same reading for the same true weight. Most scales vary a bit—they don’t always give the same reading when you step off and step right back on. Your scale now is somewhat old and is not sitting evenly on the floor. It still always reads 2 pounds too high because its aim is off, but now it is also erratic so readings deviate from 2 pounds. This morning, it reads 1 pound too low for that reason. So the reading is

When you step off and step right back on, the scale sticks in a different spot that makes it read 0.4 pound too high. The reading you get is now

You don’t like the fact that this second reading is higher than the first, so you again step off and step right back on. The scale gives yet another reading:

If you have nothing better to do than keep stepping on and off the scale, you will keep getting different readings. They center on a reading 2 pounds too high, but they vary about that center.

Your scale has two kinds of errors. If it wasn’t uneven on the floor, the scale would always read 2 pounds high. That is true every time anyone steps on the scale. This systematic error that occurs every time we make a measurement is called bias. Your scale also reads inaccurately because it is uneven on the floor—but how much this changes the reading differs every time someone steps on the scale. Sometimes the unevenness pushes the scale reading up; sometimes it pulls it down. The result is that the scale weighs 2 pounds too high on the average, but its reading varies when we weigh the same thing repeatedly. We can’t predict the error due to「stickiness,」so we call it random error.

Errors in measurement

We can think about errors in measurement this way:

A measurement process has bias if it systematically tends to overstate or understate the true value of the property it measures.

A measurement process has random error if repeated measurements on the same individual give different results. If the random error is small, we say the measurement is reliable.

To determine if the random error is small, we can use a quantity called the variance. The variance of repeated measurements on the same individual is computed as follows:

Find the arithmetic average of these measurements.

Compute the difference between each observation and the arithmetic average and square each of these differences.

Average the squared differences by dividing their sum by . This average squared difference is the variance.

A reliable measurement process will have a small variance.

For the three measurements on our uneven scale, suppose that our true weight is 140 pounds. Then the three measurements are

The average of these three measurements is

The differences between each measurement and the average are

The sum of the squares of these differences is

and so the variance of these random errors is

A reliable measurement process will have a small variance. In this example, the variance of 0.76 is quite small relative to the actual weights, so it appears that the measurement process using this scale is reliable.

A scale that always reads the same when it weighs the same item is perfectly reliable even if it is biased. For such a scale, the variance of the measurements will be 0.

Reliability says only that the result is dependable. Bias means that in repeated measurements the tendency is to systematically either overstate or understate the true value. It does not necessarily mean that every measurement overstates or understates the true value. Bias and lack of reliability are different kinds of error. And don’t confuse reliability with validity just because both sound like good qualities. Using a scale to measure weight is valid even if the scale is not reliable.

Here are two examples of measurements that are reliable but not valid.

Example 9

Do big skulls house smart brains?

In the mid-nineteenth century, it was thought that measuring the volume of a human skull would measure the intelligence of the skull’s owner. It was difficult to measure a skull’s volume reliably, even after it was no longer attached to its owner. In the 1870s, Paul Broca, a professor of surgery, showed that filling a skull with small lead shot, then pouring out the shot and weighing it, gave quite reliable measurements of the skull’s volume. These accurate measurements do not, however, give a valid measure of intelligence. Skull volume turned out to have no relation to intelligence or achievement.

Example 10

The errant clock

Suppose that you set your alarm clock for 7:00 a.m., but it goes off every morning at 6:45 a.m.

The alarm clock is highly reliable but is not valid.

Now it’s your turn

8.2 Android versus iOS. You and your friends have probably debated who has the better cell phone operating system. You know that you are correct, but your friends insist that they are. According to Consumer Report’s Cell Phones & Services 2018 report, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 ranked first and the Apple iPhone XS Max came in second. The overall scores for the phones were 83 for the Samsung (running Android) and 82 for the iPhone (running iOS). Consumer Reports gave the edge to Samsung for handset capabilities but gave the iPhone the edge for the rear camera and the navigation system. Does this information settle the debate between you and your friends? Do you think these ratings are biased, unreliable, or both? Explain your answer.

Improving Reliability, Reducing Bias

What time is it? Much modern technology, such as the Global Positioning System, which uses satellite signals to tell you where you are, requires very exact measurements of time. In 1967, the International Committee for Weights and Measures defined the second to be the time required for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of a cesium atom. The cesium atom is not impacted by changes in temperature, humidity, and air pressure like physical clocks are. To this day, the definition of the second has remained unchanged. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the world’s most accurate atomic clock and broadcasts the results (with some loss in transmission) by radio, telephone, and Internet.

Example 11

Really accurate time

Figure 8.2 This atomic clock at the National Institute of Standards and Technology is accurate to 1 second in 6 million years.

NIST’s atomic clock (Figure 8.2) is very accurate but not perfectly accurate. The world standard is Coordinated Universal Time, compiled by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sèvres, France. BIPM doesn’t have a better clock than NIST. It calculates the time by averaging the results of more than 200 atomic clocks around the world. NIST tells us (after the fact) by how much it misses the correct time. Here are the last 12 errors, in seconds:

0.0000000075 0.0000000012

0.0000000069 −0.0000000020

0.0000000067 −0.0000000045

0.0000000063 −0.0000000046

0.0000000041 −0.0000000042

0.0000000032 −0.0000000036

In the long run, NIST’s measurements of time are not biased. The NIST second is sometimes shorter than the BIPM second and sometimes longer, not always off in the same direction. NIST’s measurements are very reliable, but the numbers above do show some variation. There is no such thing as a perfectly reliable measurement. The average (mean) of several measurements is more reliable than a single measurement. That’s one reason BIPM combines the time measurements of many atomic clocks.

Use averages to improve reliability

No measuring process is perfectly reliable. The average of several repeated measurements of the same individual is more reliable (less variable) than a single measurement.

Scientists everywhere repeat their measurements and use the average to get more reliable results. Even students in a chemistry lab often do this. Just as larger samples reduce variation in a sample statistic, averaging over more measurements reduces variation in the final result.

Unfortunately, there is no similarly straightforward way to reduce the bias of measurements. Bias depends on how good the measuring instrument is. To reduce the bias, you need a better instrument. The atomic clock at NIST is accurate to 1 second in 6 million years but is a bit large to put beside your bed. (Fortunately the clock on your cell phone is pretty accurate!)

Example 12

Measuring unemployment again

Measuring unemployment is also「measurement.」The concepts of bias and reliability apply here just as they do to measuring length or time.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics checks the reliability of its measurements of unemployment by having supervisors reinterview about 5% of the sample. This is repeated measurement on the same individual, just as a student in a chemistry lab measures a weight several times.

The BLS attacks bias by improving its instrument over time. That’s what happened in 1994, when the Current Population Survey was given its biggest overhaul in more than 50 years. The old system for measuring unemployment, for example, underestimated unemployment among women because the detailed procedures had not kept up with changing patterns of women’s work. The new measurement system corrected that bias—and raised the reported rate of unemployment.

Measuring Psychological and Social Factors

Statisticians think about measurement much the same way as they think about sampling. In both settings, the big idea is to ask,「What would happen if we did this many times?」In sampling, we want to estimate a population parameter, and we worry that our estimate may be biased or vary too much from sample to sample. Now we want to measure the true value of some property, and we worry that our measurement may be biased or vary too much when we repeat the measurement on the same individual. Bias is systematic error that happens every time; high variability (low reliability) means that our result can’t be trusted because it isn’t repeatable.

Thinking of measurement this way is pretty straightforward when you are measuring your weight. To start with, you have a clear idea of what your「true weight」is. You know that there are really good scales around: start at the doctor’s office, go to the physics lab, end up at NIST. You can measure your weight as accurately as you wish. This makes it easy to see that your bathroom scale always reads 2 pounds too high. Reliability is also easy to describe—step on and off the scale many times and see how much its readings vary.

Asking「What would happen if we did this many times?」is a lot harder to put into practice when we want to measure「intelligence」or「readiness for college」or「happiness.」Any social construct or ideological belief is difficult to measure. Consider political psychologists who tried to determine the relationship between two psychological and social factor scales and who likely voters would vote for in the 2016 U.S. election.

Example 13

Psychology and the 2016 election

Polls conducted in 2016 found that Americans who scored higher on authoritarianism were more likely to vote for Donald Trump than for Hillary Clinton. Researchers in Canada and the United Kingdom wondered if right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) might indicate how Americans intended to vote in the 2016 presidential election. The researchers also posited that cognitive ability might underly the ideologies of RWA and SDO.

One goal of the research was to determine if people who were more authoritarian in nature (those higher in RWA and SDO) were more likely to support Trump in the 2016 presidential election, while those lower in RWA and SDO might support Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The researchers pointed out that political party affiliation was controlled for in all of its analyses.

Here is one example from each of the RWA and SDO scales:

On a 12-item version of the RWA scale on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), one statement was「Our country will be destroyed someday if we do not smash the perversions eating away at our moral and traditional beliefs.」Items were averaged, and higher scores denoted greater endorsement of right-wing authoritarianism.

On a 16-item version of the SDO scale from 1 (do not at all agree) to 7 (strongly agree), one statement was「Inferior groups should stay in their place.」As with the RWA, items were averaged, and higher scores denoted greater endorsement of social dominance orientation.

The researchers from this study found that those higher in the two authoritarian measures were more likely to support Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The idea of authoritarianism and social dominance are prominent in Psychology, especially in studies of prejudice and right-wing extremist movements.

Here are some questions we might ask about using either the RWA or the SDO to measure「authoritarian personality.」The same questions come to mind when we think about IQ tests or the SAT exam.

Just what is「right-wing authoritarianism」or「social dominance orientation"? We understand these much less well than we understand our weight. The answer in practice seems to be「whatever the RWA and SDO measure.」Any claim for validity must rest on what kinds of behavior high RWA and SDO scores go along with. That is, we fall back on predictive validity.

As the questions in Example 13 suggest, people who hold strong moral and traditional beliefs and who think that some groups are inferior are likely to get higher scores on both the RWA and the SDO than similar people who don’t hold those beliefs. Do the instruments reflect the beliefs of those who developed them? That is, would people with different beliefs come up with a quite different instrument?

You think you know what your true weight is. What is the true value of your RWA or SDO score? The measuring devices at NIST can help us find a true weight but not a true RWA or SDO score. If we suspect that the RWA instrument is biased as a measure of「right-wing authoritarianism」because it penalizes those with strong traditional beliefs, how can we check that?

You can weigh yourself many times to learn the reliability of your bathroom scale. If you take the RWA or SDO tests many times, you remember what answers you gave the first time. That is, repeats of the same psychological measurement are not really repeats. So reliability is hard to check in practice. Psychologists sometimes develop several forms of the same instrument in order to repeat their measurements. But how do we know these forms are really equivalent?

The point is not that psychologists lack answers to these questions. The first two are controversial because not all psychologists think about human personality in the same way. The second two questions have at least partial answers but not simple answers. The point is that「measurement,」which seems so straightforward when we measure weight, is complicated indeed when we try to measure human personality constructs.

There is a larger lesson here. Be wary of statistical「facts」about complicated constructs like personality, intelligence, and even readiness for college. The numbers look solid, as numbers always do. But data are a human product and reflect human desires, prejudices, and weaknesses. This does not mean that there is not validity and reliability in these measures, but if we don’t understand and agree on what we are measuring, the numbers may produce more disagreement than enlightenment.

Chapter 8 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 8: Statistics in Summary

To measure something means to assign a number to some property of an individual.

When we measure many individuals, we have values of a variable that describe them.

Variables are recorded in units.

When you work with data or read about a statistical study, ask if the variables are valid as numerical measures of the concepts the study discusses.

Often a rate is a more valid measure than a count.

Validity is simple for measurements of physical properties such as length, weight, and time. When we want to measure human personality and other vague properties, predictive validity is the most useful way to say whether our measures are valid.

Also ask if there are errors in measurement that reduce the value of the data. You can think about errors in measurement like this:

Some ways of measuring are biased, or systematically wrong in the same direction.

To reduce bias, you must use a better instrument to make the measurements.

Other measuring processes lack reliability, so that measuring the same individuals again would give quite different results due to random error.

A reliable measuring process will have a small variance of the measurements. You can improve the reliability of a measurement by repeating it several times and using the average result.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

In reasoning from data to a conclusion, we start with the data. In statistics, data are ultimately represented by numbers. The planning of the production of data through a sample or experiment does not by itself produce these numbers. The extent to which these numbers represent the characteristics we wish to study affect the quality and relevance of our conclusions. When you work with data or read about a statistical study, ask exactly how the variables are defined and whether they leave out some things you want to know. This chapter presents several ideas one should think about in assessing the variables measured and hence the conclusions based on these measurements.

Case Study Evaluated

Use what you have learned in this chapter to evaluate the Case Study that opened the chapter. Start by reviewing the Chapter Summary. Then communicate clearly enough for any of your classmates to understand what you are saying. The Case Study that opened the chapter is motivated by research conducted in 2017 by van der Lindenan, Dunkel, and Madison.

Brain size was measured「as the sum of the total amount of gray and white matter, identical to the procedure used by Burgaleta et al. (2012). Further, the gray/white matter ratio was calculated and direct measures of intracranial volume were also included in the analyses.」Do you think this is a valid measure of brain size? Do you think it is reliable? Do you think it is biased?

The researchers used a combination of several cognitive tests to measure general intelligence. Assume other researchers used the same combination of these cognitive tests. Is this a reliable measure of intelligence?

The researchers found some evidence that brain size and intelligence are related. However, the study described in Example 9 did not. Discuss the differences in the two studies.

In this chapter you have:

Learned the basics of measurement.

Saw how to question whether measurements are valid or accurate.

Considered how we can improve reliability and reduce bias.

8.3 Comparing marijuana use. According to the 2015–2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among young adults aged 18–25 years, approximately 28.7% of young adults in Arizona, approximately 34.6% of young adults in Michigan, and approximately 47.5% of young adults in Colorado used marijuana in the past year. (Note: At the time of the survey, Colorado was the only state of the three with legalized marijuana.) Which of the following is true?

We cannot use these percentages to compare marijuana use by young adults in these states because we do not know how many young adults used marijuana in the past year in each state.

We cannot use these percentages to compare marijuana use by young adults in these states because we do not know how many young adults live in each state.

We can use these percentages to compare marijuana use by young adults in these states because we are given rates.

None of the above is true.

8.4 What is the instrument of measurement? A college president is interested in student satisfaction with recreational facilities on campus. A questionnaire is sent to all students and asks them to rate their satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the best). The instrument of measurement is

8.5 Weight at the doctor’s office. When you visit the doctor’s office, several measurements may be taken, one of which is your weight. A doctor’s office encourages patients to keep their shoes on to be weighed and promises to subtract 2 pounds for the weight of the patient’s shoes. Which of the following is true once the patient’s weight is adjusted by 2 pounds?

This will be a reliable measure of the patient’s weight.

This will be a valid measure of the patient’s weight.

This will be an unbiased measure of the patient’s weight.

None of the above is true.

8.6 Measuring athletic ability. Which of the following is not a valid measurement of athletic ability?

Time (in seconds) to run a 100-meter dash.

Number of times a person goes to the gym per week.

Maximum weight (in pounds) a person can bench press.

Number of sit-ups a person can do in 1 minute.

8.7 Comparing teaching assistants (TAs). Professor Holmes has two teaching assistants who grade homework for a Statistics 101 course. Professor Holmes gives each of the two teaching assistants a rubric (a clear scoring guide) for the TAs to use when they grade the assignments. Holmes gives each TA the same student’s paper to grade and has each TA grade the paper according to the rubric. Professor Holmes is doing this to try to guarantee the scores given by the TAs are

Chapter 8 Exercises

8.8 Counting the unemployed? We could measure the extent of unemployment by a count (the number of people who are unemployed) or by a rate (the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed). The number of people in the labor force grew from 122 million in September 1988, to 138 million in September 1998, to 155 million in September 2008, to 162 million in September 2018. Use these facts to explain why the count of unemployed people is not a valid measure of the extent of unemployment.

8.9 Measuring a healthy lifestyle. You want to measure the「healthiness」of college students’ lifestyles. Give an example of a clearly invalid way to measure healthiness. Then briefly describe a measurement process that you think is valid.

8.10 Rates versus counts. Customers returned 40 cell phones to Verizon this spring, and only 15 to Best Buy next door. Verizon sold 800 cell phones this spring, while Best Buy sold 200.

Verizon had a greater number of cell phones returned. Why does this not show that Verizon’s cell phone customers were less satisfied than those of Best Buy?

What is the rate of returns (percentage of cell phones returned) at each of the stores?

Use the rates of returns that you calculated to explain to a friend which store you would suggest your friend go to, to purchase a cell phone.

8.11 Seat belt safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that in 2016, 11,282 occupants of motor vehicles who were wearing a restraint died in motor vehicle accidents and 10,428 who were not wearing a restraint died. These numbers suggest that not using a restraining device is safer than using one. The counts aren’t fully convincing, however. What rates would you like to know to compare the safety of using a restraint with not using one?

8.12 Tough course? A friend tells you,「In the 7:30 A.M. lecture for Statistics 101, 9 students failed, but 20 students failed in the 1:30 P.M. lecture. The 1:30 P.M. prof is a tougher grader than the 7:30 A.M. prof.」Explain why the conclusion may not be true. What additional information would you need to compare the classes?

8.13 Obesity. A 2017 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report provided the prevalence of obesity among adults in 36 countries. Based on information in the report, only 3.7% of adults in Japan are obese, compared to 22.3% in Turkey and 38.2% in the United States. Do these numbers make a convincing case that Turkey and the United States have a more substantial problem with obesity than Japan?

8.14 Capital punishment. Between 1977 and 2017, 1465 convicted criminals were put to death in the United States. Here are data on the number of executions in several states during those years, as well as the estimated June 1, 2017, population of these states:

State Population (thousands) Executions

Alabama 4875 61

Arkansas 3004 31

Delaware 962 16

Florida 20,984 95

Indiana 6667 20

Nevada 2998 12

Oklahoma 3931 112

Texas 28,305 545

Texas is the leader in executions. Because Texas is a large state, we might expect it to have many executions. Find the rate of executions for each of the states listed above, in executions per million population. Because population is given in thousands, you can find the rate per million as

Arrange the states in order of the number of executions relative to population. Is Texas still high by this measure? Do any other states stand out when you examine the rates?

8.15 Measuring intelligence. One way「intelligence」can be interpreted is as「general problem-solving ability.」Explain why it is not valid to measure intelligence by a test that asks questions such as

Who wrote「The Star-Spangled Banner」?

Who won the last soccer World Cup?

8.16 National well-being in the UK. Established in 2010, the「Measuring National Well-being」(MNW) program administered by the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom attempts to measure「how the UK is doing.」The MNW has questions that collect「both objective data (for example, unemployment rate) and subjective data (for example, satisfaction with job) to provide a more complete view of the nation’s progress than economic measures such as gross domestic product (GDP) can do alone.」How would you measure job satisfaction and its impact on the quality of life?

8.17 Measuring pain. There are 9 million enrollees in the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. It wants doctors and nurses to treat pain as a「fifth vital sign,」to be recorded along with blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Help out the VA: How would you measure a patient’s pain? (Note: There is not one correct answer for this question.)

8.18 Fighting cancer. Congress wants the medical establishment to show that progress is being made in fighting cancer. Here are some variables that might be used:

Variable 1. Total deaths from cancer. These have risen sharply over time, from 331,000 in 1970, to 505,000 in 1990, and to 572,000 in 2011.

Variable 2. The percentage of all Americans who die from cancer. The percentage of deaths due to cancer rose steadily, from 17.2% in 1970 to 23.5% in 1990, then leveled off around 23.2% in 2007.

Variable 3. The percentage of cancer patients who survive for 5 years from the time the disease was discovered. These rates are rising slowly. The 5-year survival rate was 50% in the 1975 to 1977 period and 66.5% from 2005 to 2011.

None of these variables is fully valid as a measure of the effectiveness of cancer treatment. Explain why Variables 1 and 2 could increase even if treatment is getting more effective, and why Variable 3 could increase even if treatment is getting less effective.

8.19 Testing job applicants. The law requires that tests given to job applicants must be shown to be directly job related. The Department of Labor believes that an employment test called the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) is valid for a broad range of jobs. As in the case of the SAT, blacks and Hispanics get lower average scores on the GATB than do whites. Describe briefly what must be done to establish that the GATB has predictive validity as a measure of future performance on the job.

8.20 Validity, bias, reliability. This winter I went to a local pharmacy to have my weight and blood pressure measured using a sophisticated electronic machine at the front of the store next to the checkout counter. Will the measurement of my weight be biased? Reliable? Valid? Explain your answer.

8.21 An activity on bias. Let’s study bias in an intuitive measurement. Figure 8.3 is a drawing of a tilted glass. Reproduce this drawing on 10 sheets of paper. Choose 10 people: 5 men and 5 women. Explain that the drawing represents a tilted glass of water. Ask each subject to draw the water level when this tilted glass is holding as much water as it can.

Figure 8.3

The correct level is horizontal (straight back from the lower lip of the glass). Many people make large errors in estimating the level. Use a protractor to measure the angle of each subject’s error. Were your subjects systematically wrong in the same direction? How large was the average error? Was there a clear difference between the average errors made by men and by women?

8.22 An activity on bias and reliability. Cut 5 pieces of string having these lengths in inches:

Show the pieces to another student one at a time, asking the subject to estimate the length to the nearest tenth of an inch by eye. The error your subject makes is measured value minus true value and can be either positive or negative. What is the average of the 5 errors? Explain why this average would be close to 0 if there were no bias and we used many pieces of string rather than just 5.

The following day, ask the subject to again estimate the length of each piece of string. (Present them in a different order on the second day.) Explain why the 5 differences between the first and second guesses would all be 0 if your subject were a perfectly reliable measurer of length. The bigger the differences, the less reliable your subject is. What is the average difference (ignoring whether they are positive or negative) for your subject?

8.23 More on bias and reliability. The previous exercise gives five true values for lengths. A subject measures each length twice by eye. Make up a set of results from this activity that matches each of the descriptions below. For simplicity, assume that bias means the same fixed error every time rather than an「on the average」error in many measurements.

The subject has a bias of 0.5 inch too long and is perfectly reliable.

The subject has no bias but is not perfectly reliable, so that the average difference in repeated measurements is 0.5 inch.

8.24 Even more on bias and reliability. Exercise 8.22 gives five true values for lengths. A subject measures the first length four times by eye. His measurements are

Suppose his measurements have a bias of inches.

What are the four random errors for his measurements?

What is the variance of his four measurements?

8.25 Does job training work? To measure the effectiveness of government training programs, it is usual to compare workers’ pay before and after training. But many workers sign up for training when their pay drops or they are laid off. So the「before」pay is unusually low and the pay gain looks large.

Is this bias or random error in measuring the effect of training on pay? Why?

How would you measure the success of training programs?

8.26 A recipe for poor reliability. Every month, the government releases data on「personal savings.」This number tells us how many dollars individuals saved the previous month. Savings are calculated by subtracting personal spending (an enormously large number) from personal income (another enormous number). The result is one of the government’s least reliable statistics.

Give a numerical example to show that small percentage changes in two very large numbers can produce a big percentage change in the difference between those numbers. A variable that is the difference between two big numbers is usually not very reliable.

8.27 Measuring crime. Crime data make headlines. We measure the amount of crime by the number of crimes committed or (better) by crime rates (crimes per 100,000 population). The FBI publishes data on crime in the United States by compiling crimes reported to police departments. The FBI data are recorded in the Uniform Crime Reporting Program and are based on reports from more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. The National Crime Victimization Survey publishes data about crimes based on a national probability sample of about 90,000 households per year. The victim survey shows almost two times as many crimes as the FBI report. Explain why the FBI report has a large downward bias for many types of crime. (Here is a case in which bias in producing data leads to bias in measurement.)

8.28 Measuring crime. Twice each year, the National Crime Victimization Survey asks a random sample of households whether they have been victims of crime and, if so, the details. In all, nearly 160,000 people in about 90,000 households answer these questions per year. If other people in a household are in the room while one person is answering questions, the measurement of, for example, rape and other sexual assaults could be seriously biased. Why? Would the presence of other people lead to overreporting or underreporting of sexual assaults?

8.29 Measuring pulse rate. You want to measure your resting pulse rate. You might count the number of beats in 5 seconds and multiply by 12 to get beats per minute.

Consider counting the number of beats in 15 seconds and multiplying by 4 to get beats per minute. In what way will this improve the reliability of your measurement?

Why are the first two measurement methods less reliable than actually measuring the number of beats in a minute?

8.30 Testing job applicants. A company used to give IQ tests to all job applicants. This is now illegal because IQ is not related to the performance of workers in all the company’s jobs. Does the reason for the policy change involve the reliability, the bias, or the validity of IQ tests as a measure of future job performance? Explain your answer.

8.31 The best earphones. You are writing an article for a consumer magazine based on a survey of the magazine’s readers that asked about satisfaction with mid-priced earphones for the iPod and iPhone. Of 1648 readers who reported owning the Apple in-ear headphone with remote and mic, 347 gave it an outstanding rating. Only 69 outstanding ratings were given by the 134 readers who owned Klipsch Image S4i earphones with microphone. Describe an appropriate variable, which can be computed from these counts, to measure high satisfaction with a make of earphone. Compute the values of this variable for the Apple and Klipsch earphones. Which brand has the better high-satisfaction rating?

8.32 Where to work? Each year, Forbes magazine ranks the 2000 largest metropolitan areas in the United States in an article on the best places for businesses and careers. First place in 2017 went to Portland, Oregon. Portland was ranked 5th in 2016. Fourth place in 2017 went to Denver, Colorado. Denver was ranked 1st in 2016. At the other end, York, Pennsylvania, ranked 179th in 2017, up 15 spots from 194th in 2016! Are these facts evidence that Forbes’s ratings are invalid, biased, or unreliable? Explain your choice.

8.33 Validity, bias, reliability. Give your own example of a measurement process that is valid but has large bias. Then give your own example of a measurement process that is invalid but highly reliable.
