# 0201. Samples, Good and Bad

In this chapter you will:

Understand why some polls can be misleading while others can provide reliable information.

Learn a simple method for selecting a sample that can provide trustworthy information about a population.

Case Study: Assessing Polls

As discussed in Chapter 1, in February 2014, the Michigan online news site MLive ran the story,「Take our online poll: Should Michigan legalize marijuana.」Of 9684 respondents, 7906 (81.64%) said Yes, 1190 (12.29%) said No, and 588 (6.07%) said Decriminalize but not legalize. These results would seem to indicate overwhelming support for legalizing marijuana in Michigan. However, the Pew Research Center conducted a poll on March 25–29, 2015, in which they asked,「Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?」The Pew Research Center reported that the poll consisted of telephone interviews with 1500 randomly selected adult Americans and that 53% of those surveyed favor the legal use of marijuana. This is a majority of those surveyed but not the overwhelming majority that MLive found. There is a large discrepancy in the findings of these two polls. This may be because the polls were conducted at different times, the populations sampled were different (Michigan versus all adult Americans), the MLive poll had a much larger sample than the Pew poll, the questions asked were not identical, or perhaps the data from one or both polls is simply bad. By the end of this chapter you will be able to assess whether the data from the polls in this case study are good or bad.

How to Sample Badly

Statistics in Your World

Big data「Big data」is a vague term, but it is often used by some to emphasize the sheer size of data sets that now exist. Big data is often「found data,」not a random sample. Proponents for big data claim that because every single data point can now be captured, old statistical sampling techniques are obsolete. In essence, they say, we have data on the entire population. Is this true? Many statisticians disagree. They challenge the notion that we could ever have all the data. The claim that we have the entire population is often an assumption, rather than a fact about the data. Although sample sizes are enormous, proponents for big data often ignore the bias that accompanies nonrandom sampling.

For many years in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, only one company had been allowed to provide ambulance service. In 1999, the local paper, the Town Talk, asked readers to call in to offer their opinion on whether the company should keep its monopoly. Call-in polls are generally automated: call one telephone number to vote Yes and call another number to vote No. Telephone companies often charged callers to use these numbers.

The Town Talk got 3763 calls, which suggests unusual interest in ambulance service. Investigation showed that 638 calls came from the ambulance company office or from the homes of its executives. Many more, no doubt, came from lower-level employees.「We’ve got employees who are concerned about this situation, their job stability, and their families and maybe called more than they should have,」said a company vice president. Other sources said employees were told to, as they say in Chicago,「vote early and often.」

As the Town Talk learned, it is easier to sample badly than to sample well. The paper relied on voluntary response, allowing people to call in rather than actively selecting its own sample. The result was biased—the sample was overweighted with people favoring the ambulance monopoly. Voluntary response samples attract people who feel strongly about the issue in question. These people, like the employees of the ambulance company, may not fairly represent the opinions of the entire population.

Key Terms

The design of a statistical study is biased if it systematically favors certain outcomes.

Selection of whichever individuals are easiest to reach is called convenience sampling.

A voluntary response sample chooses itself by responding to a general appeal. Write-in or call-in opinion polls are examples of voluntary response samples.

Convenience samples and voluntary response samples are often biased.

There are other ways to sample badly. Suppose that we sell your company several crates of oranges each week. You examine a sample of oranges from each crate to determine the quality of our oranges. It is easy to inspect a few oranges from the top of each crate, but these oranges may not be representative of the entire crate. Those on the bottom are more often damaged in shipment. If we were less than honest, we might make sure that the rotten oranges are packed on the bottom, with some good ones on top for you to inspect. If you sample from the top, your sample results are again biased—the sample oranges are systematically better than the population they are supposed to represent.

Example 1

Interviewing at the mall

Squeezing the oranges on the top of the crate is one example of convenience sampling. Mall interviews are another. Manufacturers and advertising agencies often use interviews at shopping malls to gather information about the habits of consumers and the effectiveness of ads. A sample of mall shoppers is fast and cheap. But people contacted at shopping malls are not representative of the entire U.S. population. They are richer, for example, and more likely to be teenagers or retired. Moreover, the interviewers tend to select neat, safe-looking individuals from the stream of customers. Mall samples are biased: they systematically overrepresent some parts of the population (prosperous people, teenagers, and retired people) and underrepresent others. The opinions of such a convenience sample may be very different from those of the population as a whole.

Example 2

Write-in opinion polls

Ann Landers was a popular advice columnist, who wrote a daily column from 1955–2002. She once asked the readers of her advice column,「If you had it to do over again, would you have children?」She received nearly 10,000 responses, almost 70% saying,「NO!」Can it be true that 70% of parents regret having children? Not at all. This is a voluntary response sample. People who feel strongly about an issue, particularly people with strong negative feelings, are more likely to take the trouble to respond. Ann Landers’s results are strongly biased—the percentage of parents who would not have children again is much higher in her sample than in the population of all parents.

On August 24, 2011, Abigail Van Buren (the niece of Ann Landers) revisited this question in her column「Dear Abby.」A reader asked,「I’m wondering … if you asked the same question today, what the majority of your readers would answer.」

Ms. Van Buren responded,「The results were considered shocking at the time because the majority of responders said they would NOT have children if they had it to do over again.」

In October 2011, Ms. Van Buren wrote that when she again asked readers the same question that this time the majority of respondents would have children again. That is encouraging, but this was, again, a write-in poll.

Write-in and call-in opinion polls are almost sure to lead to strong bias. In fact, only about 15% of the public have ever responded to a call-in poll, and these tend to be the same people who call radio talk shows. That’s not a representative sample of the population as a whole.

When is random too random? The streaming music service Spotify received complaints from listeners that the「shuffle」feature, used to play songs in a playlist in a random order, was not random enough. Listeners were hearing the same tracks two or three days in a row or the same artists back to back. The problem was not a lack of randomness, but too much randomness. Spotify developer Mattias Petter Johansson explained that「to humans, truly random does not feel random.」

Simple Random Samples

In a voluntary response sample, people choose whether to respond. In a convenience sample, the interviewer makes the choice. In both cases, personal choice produces bias. The statistician’s remedy is to allow impersonal chance to choose the sample. A sample chosen by chance allows neither favoritism by the sampler nor self-selection by respondents. Choosing a sample by chance attacks bias by giving all individuals an equal chance to be chosen. Rich and poor, young and old, black and white, all have the same chance to be in the sample.

The simplest way to use chance to select a sample is to place names in a hat (the population) and draw out a handful (the sample). This is the idea of simple random sampling.

Key Terms

A simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals from the population chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals has an equal chance to be the sample actually selected.

An SRS not only gives each individual an equal chance to be chosen (thus avoiding bias in the choice) but also gives every possible sample an equal chance to be chosen. Drawing names from a hat does this. Write 100 names on identical slips of paper and mix them in a hat. This is a population. Now draw 10 slips, one after the other. This is an SRS because any 10 slips have the same chance as any other 10.

Now it’s your turn

2.1 Sampling my class. There are 40 students in my class. My classroom has eight rows of seats with five seats per row. On the first day of class, all 40 students attend and all 40 seats are filled. I decide to take a sample of eight students. To do this, I write the numbers 1 through 5 on slips of paper, shuffle the slips of paper thoroughly, and select a number. The student sitting that number of seats in from the left in the first row is selected to be part of my sample. I repeat the process of shuffling and drawing a number once for each row. In this way I obtain my sample of eight students. Every student in the class has a 1-in-5 chance of being selected when I come to their row. Thus, every student has the same chance of being selected. Is the sample a simple random sample? Explain.

Drawing names from a hat makes clear what it means to give each individual and each possible set of n individuals the same chance to be chosen. That’s the idea of an SRS. Of course, drawing slips from a hat would be a bit awkward for a sample of the country’s 117 million households. In practice, real sample surveys use computer-generated random digits to choose samples. Many statistical software packages have random number generators that generate random digits. Some also allow one to choose an SRS.

Example 3

How to choose an SRS using software

A college president wants to appoint five undergraduate students to serve on a committee to make recommendations about the design of new classrooms that will meet students’ perceived needs. To avoid bias, she chooses an SRS of 5 of the 30 departments in the college, and asks the department chair of each of the chosen departments to select one of their undergraduate majors to serve on the committee. Here are the steps for selecting the SRS of 5 departments.

Step 1: Label. Give each department a numerical label between 1 and 30. Here is the list of departments, with labels attached, using 1 to 30:

1 African American and African Studies

2 Agriculture

3 Architecture

4 Art

5 Biology

6 Business

7 Chemistry

8 Communications

9 Comparative Studies

10 Computer Science

21 Philosophy

22 Physics

23 Political Science

24 Psychology

25 Religion

26 Sociology

27 Social Work

28 Statistics

29 Theater

30 Women’s Studies

Step 2: Software. Use statistical software to generate a random integer between 1 and 30. Repeat this process, ignoring any values that were previously generated, until you obtain five different integers between 1 and 30. The president used software and generated the numbers 18, 9, 10, 3, 9, and 1. The five different integers are 18, 9, 10, 3, and 1, so the sample is the departments of Mathematics, Comparative Studies, Computer Science, Architecture, and African American and African Studies.

Are these random digits really random? Not a chance. The random digits in Table A were produced by a computer program. Computer programs do exactly what you tell them to do. Give the program the same input, and it will produce exactly the same「random」digits. Of course, clever people have devised computer programs that produce output that looks like random digits. These are called「pseudo-random numbers,」and that’s what Table A contains. Pseudo-random numbers work fine for statistical randomizing, but they have hidden nonrandom patterns that can mess up more refined uses.

Generating a random integer with a value between 1 and 30 is equivalent to writing the numbers 1 to 30 on identical slips of paper, placing them in a hat, mixing the slips well, and drawing one at random. The computer does the mixing and drawing.

Some statistical software may allow you to generate unique labels. A tool that is available on the Web is the Research Randomizer at www.randomizer.org. Click on the link Randomize Now and fill in the boxes. You can even ask the Randomizer to arrange your sample in numerical order (see Figure 2.1).

Figure 2.1 Using the Research Randomizer at www.randomizer.org.

We encourage you to use software to select an SRS, but if you are unable to use software, you can use a table of random digits to choose small samples by hand.

Key Terms

A table of random digits is a long string of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with these two properties: Each entry in the table is equally likely to be any of the 10 digits 0 through 9.

The entries are independent of each other. That is, knowledge of one part of the table gives no information about any other part.

Table A at the back of the book is a table of random digits. You can think of Table A as the result of asking an assistant (or a computer) to mix the digits 0 to 9 in a hat, draw one, then replace the digit drawn, mix again, draw a second digit, and so on. The assistant’s (or computer’s) mixing and drawing save us the work of mixing and drawing when we need to randomize. Table A begins with the digits 19223950340575628713. To make the table easier to read, the digits appear in groups of five and in numbered rows. The groups and rows have no meaning—the table is just a long list of randomly chosen digits. Here’s how to use the table to choose an SRS.

Example 4

How to choose an SRS using a table of random digits

To repeat Example 3, we begin by assigning numerical labels to the 30 departments.

Step 1: Label. Give each department a numerical label, using as few digits as possible. Two digits are needed to label 30 departments, so we use labels

01, 02, 03, … , 28, 29, 30

It is also correct to use labels 00 to 29 or even another choice of 30 two-digit labels. Here is the list of departments, with labels attached, using 01 to 30:

01 African American and African Studies

02 Agriculture

03 Architecture

04 Art

05 Biology

06 Business

07 Chemistry

08 Communications

09 Comparative Studies

11 Economics

Step 2: Table. Enter Table A anywhere and read two-digit groups. Suppose we enter at line 130, which is

69051 64817 87174 09517 84534 06489 87201 97245

The first 10 two-digit groups in this line are

69 05 16 48 17 87 17 40 95 17

Each two-digit group in Table A is equally likely to be any of the 100 possible groups, 00, 01, 02, … , 99. So two-digit groups choose two-digit labels at random. That’s just what we want.

The college president used only labels 01 to 30, so we ignore all other two-digit groups. The first five labels between 01 and 30 that we encounter in the table choose our sample. Of the first 10 labels in line 130, we ignore five because they are too high (over 30). The others are 05, 16, 17, 17, and 17. The clients labeled 05, 16, and 17 go into the sample. Ignore the second and third 17s because that department is already in the sample. Now run your finger across line 130 (and continue to line 131 if needed) until five departments are chosen.

The sample is the departments labeled 05, 16, 17, 20, 19. These are Biology, Geology, History, Pharmacy, and Music.

Choose an SRS in two steps

Step 1: Label. Assign a numerical label to every individual in the population. Be sure that all labels have the same number of digits if you plan to use a table of random digits.

Step 2: Software or table. Use random digits to select labels at random.

When using a table of random digits, as long as all labels have the same number of digits, all individuals will have the same chance to be chosen. Use the shortest possible labels: one digit for a population of up to 10 members, two digits for 11 to 100 members, three digits for 101 to 1000 members, and so on. As standard practice, we recommend that you begin with label 1 (or 01 or 001, as needed). You can read digits from Table A in any order—across a row, down a column, and so on—because the table has no order. As standard practice, we recommend reading across rows.

Using software or a table of random digits is much quicker than drawing names from a hat. As Examples 3 and 4 show, choosing an SRS has two steps.

Can You Trust a Sample?

Golfing at random Random drawings give all the same chance to be chosen, so they offer a fair way to decide who gets a scarce good—like a round of golf. Lots of golfers want to play the famous Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland. A few can reserve in advance. Most must hope that chance favors them in the daily random drawing for tee times. At the height of the summer season, only one in six wins the right to pay £180 (about $250) for a round.

The Town Talk, Ann Landers, and mall interviews produce samples. We can’t trust results from these samples because they are chosen in ways that invite bias. We have more confidence in results from an SRS because it uses impersonal chance to avoid bias. The first question to ask of any sample is whether it was chosen at random. Opinion polls and other sample surveys carried out by people who know what they are doing use random sampling.

Example 5

A Gallup Poll

A June 2018 Gallup Poll on immigration asked the question,「On the whole, do you think immigration is a good thing or a bad thing for this country today?」Gallup reported that the poll found that 75% of respondents think immigration is a good thing for the United States. Is it actually the case that a majority of Americans believe immigration is a good thing? Ask first how Gallup selected its sample. Later in the article, we read this:「Results … are based on telephone interviews … with a random sample of 1,520 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia …」Gallup goes on to clarify that the sample included 30% landline and 70% cellular phone numbers selected using random-digit dialing.

This is a good start toward gaining our confidence. Gallup tells us what population it has in mind (people at least 18 years old living in the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii). We know that the sample from this population was of size 1520 and, most important, it was chosen at random. There is more to consider in assessing a poll, and we will soon discuss this, but we have at least heard the comforting words「random sample.」

Chapter 2 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 2: Statistics in Summary

We select a sample in order to get information about some population.

How can we choose a sample that fairly represents the population? Convenience samples and voluntary response samples are common but do not produce trustworthy data. These sampling methods are usually biased. That is, they systematically favor some parts of the population over others in choosing the sample.

The deliberate use of chance in producing data is one of the big ideas of statistics. Random samples use chance to choose a sample, thus avoiding bias due to personal choice.

The basic type of random sample is the simple random sample, which gives all samples of the same size the same chance to be the sample we actually choose.

To choose an SRS by hand, use a table of random digits such as Table A in the back of the book, or use software.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

The first step in reasoning from data to a conclusion is obtaining data. In Chapter 1, we discussed sample surveys as one way to collect data in an observational study. The method of selecting the sample in a sample survey affects how well the sample represents the population. Biased sampling methods, such as convenience sampling and voluntary response samples, produce data that can be misleading, resulting in incorrect conclusions. Simple random sampling avoids bias and produces data that give us confidence that the first step in our argument is sound.

In the next chapter, we look more closely at what a simple random sample tells us about the population from which it is selected. And in Chapter 4, we discuss some of the problems faced by people who take surveys in the real world.

2.5 Simple random sample. I plan to take a sample of 10 students in my introductory statistics class. Which of the following is a simple random sample?

I choose the 10 students sitting in the front row. Students select seats at random, so this would be a simple random sample.

I choose the first 10 students who enter the classroom. Students arrive at random, so this would be a simple random sample.

I write the names of all the students on similar slips of paper, put the slips of paper in a box, mix them well, and draw 10 slips from the box. The 10 names drawn are my sample.

All of the above are simple random samples.

2.6 An SRS? The leader of a student organization wishes to form a committee that will consist of 5 of the 50 members. He decides to take an SRS of size five from the members and those selected will comprise the committee. He chooses an SRS of size five and all are men. He would like to have some women on the task force, so he decides to take another SRS. This time there are three women and two men in the sample, so he decides these five will form the committee. We can conclude the sample obtained is

an SRS because the final sample was obtained by simple random sampling.

an SRS because all members had the same chance of being in the final sample.

not an SRS because a sample consisting entirely of men is not allowed.

not an SRS because the first sample was not balanced between men and women.

2.7 Choosing a simple random sample. Angela, Juan, Kevin, Lucinda, and Tanya are students in my capstone course. I wish to select a simple random sample of two of them to work on a project. I label Angela as 1, Juan as 2, Kevin as 3, Lucinda as 4, and Tanya as 5. I generate the following sequence of four random digits using statistical software: 1, 7, 8, 4. Based on these digits, my simple random sample is

2.8 Emails to the civic association. You are the president of the neighborhood civic association. A brewpub is thinking of opening a restaurant and bar in the neighborhood. You report to the members of the civic association that 91 emails have been received on the issue, of which 71 oppose opening the restaurant and bar.「I’m surprised that most of our residents oppose the restaurant and bar. I thought it would be quite popular,」says a member of the association. Are you convinced that a majority of the residents oppose the restaurant and bar? How would you explain the statistical issue to the member?

2.9 Instant opinion. In July 2018, Green Car Reports conducted a Twitter poll and asked their readers「Which modern electric car will be the first classic?」Of the 466 people who chose to take the poll, 48% chose the Tesla Roadster.

What is the sample size for this poll?

Explain why the poll may give unreliable information.

2.10 More instant opinion. In July 2018, the Washington Examiner reported on an online poll conducted by the Drudge Report asking participants whether Hilary Clinton should run for president ever again. Sixty-five percent of poll participants said they did not want the former secretary of state and failed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee to launch「one last」campaign for the White House, while 34 percent were in favor of a third bid. The article goes on to say that more than 318,600 people had taken part in the online survey.

What is the sample size for this poll?

The sample size for this poll is much larger than is typical for polls such as the Gallup Poll. Explain why the poll may give unreliable information, even with such a large sample size.

2.11 The Drudge Report takes a poll. Beginning in 2017, there was considerable interest in the Special Counsel investigation, conducted by Robert Mueller, of possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In 2018, the Drudge Report asked its readers,「Should President Trump fire Mueller?」As of August 9, 2018, 818,628 votes had been received on the poll with 76% answering Yes to the question. Explain why this sample is certainly biased, even though the sample size is large. What is the likely direction of the bias? That is, is 76% probably higher or lower than the truth about the opinions of the population of all adults in the United States?

2.12 We don’t like one-way streets. Highway planners decided to make a main street in West Lafayette, Indiana, a one-way street. The Lafayette Journal and Courier took a one-day poll by inviting readers to call a telephone number to record their comments. The next day, the paper reported:

Journal and Courier readers overwhelmingly prefer two-way traffic flow in West Lafayette’s Village area to one-way streets. By nearly a 7–1 margin, callers on Wednesday complained about the one-way streets that have been in place since May. Of the 98 comments received, all but 14 said no to one-way.

What population do you think the newspaper wants information about?

Is the proportion of this population who favor one-way streets almost certainly larger or smaller than the proportion of 14/98 in the sample? Why?

2.13 Design your own bad sample. Your college wants to gather student opinion about parking for students on campus. It isn’t practical to contact all students.

Give an example of a way to choose a sample of students that is poor practice because it depends on voluntary response.

Give an example of a bad way to choose a sample that doesn’t use voluntary response.

2.14 A call-in opinion poll. In 2005, the San Francisco Bay Times reported on a poll in New Zealand that found that New Zealanders opposed the nation’s new gay-inclusive civil-unions law by a 3–1 ratio. This poll was a call-in poll that cost $1 to participate in. The San Francisco Bay Times article also reported that a scientific polling organization found that New Zealanders favor the law by a margin of 56.4% to 39.3%. Explain to someone who knows no statistics why the two polls can give such widely differing results and which poll is likely to be more reliable.

2.15 Call-in versus random sample polls. A national survey of TV network news viewers found that 48% said they would believe a phone-in poll of 300,000 persons rather than a random sample of 1000 persons. Of the viewers, 42% said they would believe the random sample poll. Explain to someone who knows no statistics why the opinions of only 1000 randomly chosen respondents are a better guide to what all people think than the opinions of 300,000 callers.

2.16 Choose an SRS. A firm wants to understand the attitudes of its managers toward its system for assessing employee performance. Following is a list of all 32 of the firm’s managers.

2.19 Is this an SRS? A university has 30,000 undergraduate and 10,000 graduate students. A survey of student opinion concerning health care benefits for domestic partners of students selects 300 of the 30,000 undergraduate students at random and then separately selects 100 of the 10,000 graduate students at random. The 400 students chosen make up the sample.

Explain why this sampling method gives each student an equal chance to be chosen.

Nonetheless, this is not an SRS. Why not?

2.20 How much do students pay for rent? A university’s housing and residence office wants to know how much students pay per month for rent in off-campus housing. The university does not have enough on-campus housing for students, and this information will be used in a brochure about student housing. The population contains 12,304 students who live in off-campus housing and have not yet graduated. The university will send a questionnaire to an SRS of 200 of these students, drawn from an alphabetized list.

Describe how you would label the students in order to select the sample. If you will use Table A to choose an SRS, be sure to explain how many digits make up each of your labels.

Use software or Table A to select the first five students in the sample. If you use Table A, begin at line 125.

2.21 Apartment living. You are planning a report on apartment living in a college town. You decide to select three apartment complexes at random for in-depth interviews with residents. Use software or Table A, starting at line 112, to select a simple random sample of 3 of the following 36 apartment complexes. Use labels 00 to 35.

2.22 How do random digits behave? Which of the following statements are true of a table of random digits, and which are false? Explain your answers.

Each pair of digits has a chance of 1/100 of being 00.

There are exactly four 4s in each row of 40 digits.

The digits 12345 can never appear as a group because this pattern is not random.

2.23 Twitter Poll. During the 2018 NBA playoffs, the San Antonio Spurs were down 3 games to 1 against the Golden State Warriors (the eventual NBA champions for the second year in a row). After game 4 of the series, KSAT in San Antonio ran a Twitter Poll asking followers「Do you think the Spurs will win game 5 and force the series back to San Antonio?」Fifty-seven percent of those responding said Yes. Explain why this opinion poll is almost certainly biased in terms of representing the chances of San Antonio beating the Warriors.

2.24 More randomization. Most sample surveys call residential telephone numbers at random. They do not, however, always ask their questions of the person who picks up the phone. Instead, they ask about the adults who live in the residence and choose one at random to be in the sample. Why is this a good idea?

2.25 Racial profiling and traffic stops. The Denver Police Department wants to know if Hispanic residents of Denver believe that the police use racial profiling when making traffic stops. A sociologist prepares several questions about the police. The police department chooses an SRS of 200 mailing addresses in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods and sends a uniformed Hispanic police officer to each address to ask the questions of an adult living there.

What are the population and the sample?

Why are the results likely to be biased even though the sample is an SRS?

2.26 Random selection? Choosing at random is a「fair」way to decide who gets some scarce good, in the sense that everyone has the same chance to win. But random choice isn’t always a good idea—sometimes we don’t want to treat everyone the same because some people have a better claim. In each of the following situations, would you support choosing at random? Give your reasons in each case.

The basketball arena has 4000 student seats, and 7000 students want tickets. Shall we choose 4000 of the 7000 at random?

The list of people waiting for liver transplants is much larger than the number of available livers. Shall we let impersonal chance decide who gets a transplant?

During the Vietnam War, young men were chosen for army service at random, by a「draft lottery.」Is this the best way to decide who goes and who stays home?
