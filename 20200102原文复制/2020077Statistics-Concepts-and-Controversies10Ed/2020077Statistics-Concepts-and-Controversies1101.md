Learn how to interpret histograms and stemplots.

Case Study: Apartment Rental Prices

For some students, the cost of living can be a deciding factor when it comes to choosing a college or university to attend. Students who want to live off-campus, in particular, might be especially interested in knowing how much they will need to spend per month on housing. Which cities across the United States offer the most and least expensive apartment rental prices?

In 2018, the website abodo.com published its 2017 Annual Rent Report. The report included a list of the average rental prices of one-bedroom apartments in 85 U.S. cities. Topping the list, with an average rental price of $3,333, was San Francisco, California. The least expensive city on the list was Fort Wayne, Indiana, with an average rental price of $526. Although some characteristics of a data set can be discerned from examining a list of numbers, it can be difficult to see patterns in large lists. As we saw in Chapter 10, graphs are a powerful way to make sense of large collections of numbers. By the end of this chapter, you will know how to make a graph to examine the distribution of average apartment rental prices and what to look for when examining this graph.

Histograms

Categorical variables record group membership, such as the marital status of a man or the race of a college student. We can use a pie chart or bar graph to display the distribution of categorical variables because they have relatively few values. What about quantitative variables such as the SAT scores of students admitted to a college or the income of families? These variables take so many values that a graph of the distribution is clearer if nearby values are grouped together. The most common graph of the distribution of a quantitative variable is a histogram.

Example 1

How to make a histogram

Table 11.1 presents the percentage of residents aged 65 years and older in each of the 50 states. To make a histogram of this distribution, proceed as follows.

Step 1. Divide the range of the data into classes of equal width. The data in Table 11.1 range from 7.7 to 17.3, so we choose as our classes

Table 11.1 Percentage of residents aged 65 and older in the states, 2010

State Percent State Percent State Percent

Alabama 13.8 Louisiana 12.3 Ohio 14.1

Alaska 7.7 Maine 15.9 Oklahoma 13.5

Arizona 13.8 Maryland 12.3 Oregon 13.9

Arkansas 14.4 Massachusetts 13.8 Pennsylvania 15.4

California 11.4 Michigan 13.8 Rhode Island 14.4

Colorado 10.9 Minnesota 12.9 South Carolina 13.7

Connecticut 14.2 Mississippi 12.8 South Dakota 14.3

Delaware 14.4 Missouri 14.0 Tennessee 13.4

Florida 17.3 Montana 14.8 Texas 10.3

Georgia 10.7 Nebraska 13.5 Utah 9.0

Hawaii 14.3 Nevada 12.0 Vermont 14.6

Idaho 12.4 New Hampshire 13.5 Virginia 12.2

Illinois 12.5 New Jersey 13.5 Washington 12.3

Indiana 13.0 New Mexico 13.2 West Virginia 16.0

Iowa 14.9 New York 13.5 Wisconsin 13.8

Kansas 13.2 North Carolina 12.9 Wyoming 12.4

Kentucky 13.3 North Dakota 14.5

Data from Age and Sex Composition: 2010 Census Briefs; available online at https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf.

Be sure to specify the classes precisely so that each individual falls into exactly one class. In other words, be sure that the classes are exclusive (no individual is in more than one class) and exhaustive (every individual appears in some class). The individuals in this example are states. A state with 7.9% of its residents aged 65 and older would fall into the first class, whereas a state with 8.0% of its residents aged 65 and older would fall into the second class.

Step 2. Count the number of individuals in each class. Here are the counts of states in each class:

Class Count Class Count Class Count

7.0 to 7.9 1 11.0 to 11.9 1 15.0 to 15.9 2

8.0 to 8.9 0 12.0 to 12.9 11 16.0 to 16.9 1

9.0 to 9.9 1 13.0 to 13.9 17 17.0 to 17.9 1

10.0 to 10.9 3 14.0 to 14.9 12

Step 3. Draw the histogram. Mark on the horizontal axis the scale for the variable whose distribution you are displaying. That’s「percentage of residents aged 65 and older」in this example. The scale runs from 5 to 20 because that range spans the classes we chose. The vertical axis contains the scale of counts. Each bar represents a class. The base of the bar covers the class, and the bar height is the class count. There is no horizontal space between the bars unless a class is empty, so that its bar has height zero. Figure 11.1 is our histogram.

Figure 11.1 Histogram of the percentages of residents aged 65 and older in the 50 states, Example 1. Note the outlier.

The horizontal axis represents ‘Percentage of residents 65 and older’ and the vertical axis represents ‘Number of States’. The data given in the histogram are as follows:

Percent of residents, 7 to 8; Number of states, 1

Percent of residents, 9 to 10; Number of states, 1

Percent of residents, 10 to 11; Number of states, 3.5

Percent of residents, 11 to 12; Number of states, 1

Percent of residents, 12 to 13; Number of states, 11

Percent of residents, 13 to 14; Number of states, 17

Percent of residents, 14 to 15; Number of states, 12

Percent of residents, 15 to 16; Number of states, 2

Percent of residents, 16 to 17; Number of states, 1

Percent of residents, 17 to 18; Number of states, 1

Statistics in Your World

What the eye really sees We make the bars in bar graphs and histograms equal in width because the eye responds to their area. That’s roughly true. Careful study by statistician William Cleveland shows that our eyes「see」the size of a bar in proportion to the 0.7 power of its area. Suppose, for example, that one figure in a pictogram is both twice as high and twice as wide as another. The area of the bigger figure is 4 times that of the smaller. But we perceive the bigger figure as only 2.6 times the size of the smaller because 2.6 is 4 to the 0.7 power.

Just as with bar graphs, our eyes respond to the area of the bars in a histogram. Be sure that the classes for a histogram have equal widths. There is no one right choice for the number of classes. Some people recommend between 10 and 20 classes but suggest using fewer when the size of the data set is small. Too few classes will give a「skyscraper」histogram, with all values in a few classes with tall bars. Too many classes will produce a「pancake」graph, with most classes having one or no observations. Neither choice will give a good picture of the shape of the distribution. You must use your judgment in choosing classes to display the shape. Statistics software will choose the classes for you and may use slightly different rules than those we have discussed. The computer’s choice is usually a good one, but you can change it if you want. When using statistical software, it is good practice to check what rules are used to determine the classes.

Now it’s your turn

Interpreting Histograms

Making a statistical graph is not an end in itself. The purpose of the graph is to help us understand the data. After you (or your computer) make a graph, always ask,「What do I see?」Here is a general strategy for looking at graphs.

Key Terms

In any graph of data, look for an overall pattern and also for striking deviations from that pattern.

Key Terms

An outlier in any graph of data is an individual observation that falls outside the overall pattern of the graph.

We have already applied this strategy to line graphs. Trend and seasonal variation are common overall patterns in a line graph. The more drastic decrease in unemployment in mid-2010 for those with less than a high school degree, seen in Figure 10.7 (page 222), is deviating from the overall pattern of small dips and increases apparent throughout the rest of the line. This is an example of a striking deviation from the general pattern that one observes for the rest of the time period. In the case of the histogram of Figure 11.1, it is easiest to begin with deviations from the overall pattern of the histogram. One state stands out as separated from the main body of the histogram. You can find this in the table once the histogram has called attention to it. Alaska has 7.7% of its residents over age 65. This state is a clear outlier.

Is Utah, with 9.0% of its population over 65, an outlier? Whether an observation is an outlier is to some extent a matter of judgment, although statisticians have developed some objective criteria for identifying possible outliers. Utah is the smallest of the main body of observations and, unlike Alaska, is not separated from the general pattern. We would not call Utah an outlier. Once you have spotted outliers, look for an explanation. Many outliers are due to mistakes, such as typing 4.0 as 40. Other outliers point to the special nature of some observations. Explaining outliers usually requires some background information. It is not surprising that Alaska, the northern frontier, has few residents 65 and older.

To see the overall pattern of a histogram, ignore any outliers. This is not to suggest that outliers should be discarded or that we should pretend those values do not exist. If any outliers are present, we want to acknowledge their existence and think about how they impact the distribution. Here is a simple way to organize your thinking.

Key Terms

To describe the overall pattern of a distribution:

Describe the center and the variability.

Describe the shape of the histogram in a few words.

We will learn how to describe center and variability numerically in Chapter 12. For now, we can describe the center of a distribution by its midpoint, the value at roughly the middle of all the values in the distribution. We can describe the variability of a distribution by giving the smallest and largest values, ignoring any outliers. We can then mention the presence of possible outliers in an effort to more completely describe the distribution.

Example 2

Describing distributions

Look again at the histogram in Figure 11.1. Shape: The distribution has a single peak. It is roughly symmetric—that is, the pattern is similar on both sides of the peak. Center: The midpoint of the distribution is close to the single peak, at about 13%. Variability: The variability is about 9% to 18% if we ignore the outlier. We have one outlying value, at 7.7%, that falls away from the overall pattern.

Example 3

Tuition and fees in Illinois

There are 114 colleges and universities in Illinois. Their tuition and fees for the 2016–2017 school year range from $2095 at Kaskaskia College to $53,649 at the University of Chicago. Figure 11.2 is a histogram of the tuition and fees charged by all 114 Illinois colleges and universities. We see that many (mostly community colleges) charge less than $6000. The distribution extends out to the right. At the upper extreme, two colleges charge between $48,000 and $54,000.

Figure 11.2 Histogram of the tuition and fees charged by 114 Illinois colleges and universities in the 2016–2017 academic year, Example 3. Data from www.isac.org.

The horizontal axis represents, ‘Tuition and fees (thousand dollars) and vertical axis represents, ‘Number of Illinois colleges’. The data given in the histogram are as follows:

Tuition and fees, 0 to 6 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 47

Tuition and fees, 6 to 12 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 7

Tuition and fees, 12 to 18 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 14

Tuition and fees, 18 to 24 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 5

Tuition and fees, 24 to 30 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 12

Tuition and fees, 30 to 36 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 16

Tuition and fees, 36 to 42 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 5

Tuition and fees, 42 to 48 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 5

Tuition and fees, 48 to 54 thousand dollars; Number of colleges, 3

The distribution of tuition and fees at Illinois colleges, shown in Figure 11.2, has a quite different shape from the distribution in Figure 11.1. There is a strong peak in the lowest cost class. Most colleges charge less than $12,000, but there is a long right tail extending up to almost $54,000. We call a distribution with a long tail on one side skewed. The center is roughly $12,000 since close to half the colleges charge less than this. The variability is large, from $2095 to more than $53,000. According to what we can see in the histogram, there appear to be no outliers—the colleges with the highest tuitions just continue the long right tail that is part of the overall pattern.

Key Terms

A distribution is symmetric if the right and left sides of the histogram are approximately mirror images of each other.

A distribution is skewed to the right if the right side of the histogram (containing the half of the observations with larger values) extends much farther out than the left side. It is skewed to the left if the left side of the histogram extends much farther out than the right side.

When you describe a distribution, concentrate on the main features. Look for major peaks, not for minor ups and downs in the bars of the histogram like those in Figure 11.2. Look for gaps and clear outliers that fall away from the overall pattern, not just for the smallest and largest observations. Look for rough symmetry or clear skewness.

A distribution is symmetric if the two sides of a figure like a histogram are exact mirror images of each other. Data are almost never exactly symmetric, so we are willing to call histograms like that in Figure 11.1 roughly symmetric as an overall description. The tuition distribution in Figure 11.2, on the other hand, is clearly skewed to the right. Here are more examples.

Example 4

Lake elevation levels

Lake Murray is a man-made reservoir located in South Carolina. It is used mainly for recreation, such as boating, fishing, and water sports. It is also used to provide backup hydroelectric power for South Carolina Electric and Gas. The lake levels fluctuate with the highest levels in summer (for safe boating and good fishing) and the lowest levels in winter (for water quality). Water can be released at the dam in the case of heavy rains or to let water out to maintain winter levels. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) monitors water levels in Lake Murray. The histograms in Figure 11.3 were created using 67,810 hourly elevation levels from November 1, 2007, through August 11, 2015.

Figure 11.3 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported hourly lake levels from November 1, 2007, through August 11, 2015, for Lake Murray, SC. There are 67,810 lake level observations. The histogram on the left is showing the number of times the lake was at each level. The histogram on the right shows this same data as the percent of times Lake Murray reached each level.

The data in the first histogram are as follows:

Lake level, 300 to 351; Count, 1000

Lake level, 351 to 352; Count, 100

Lake level, 352 to 353; Count, 2000

Lake level, 353 to 354; Count, 1500

Lake level, 354 to 355; Count, 1700

Lake level, 355 to 356; Count, 5000

Lake level, 356 to 357; Count, 12,500

Lake level, 357 to 358; Count, 17,500

Lake level, 358 to 359; Count, 24,000

Lake level, 359 to 360; Count, 4000

The data in the second histogram are as follows.

Lake level, 300 to 351; Percent, 1

Lake level, 351 to 352; Percent, 0.1

Lake level, 352 to 353; Percent, 3

Lake level, 353 to 354; Percent, 2

Lake level, 354 to 355; Percent, 2.5

Lake level, 355 to 356; Percent, 9

Lake level, 356 to 357; Percent, 18

Lake level, 357 to 358; Percent, 25

Lake level, 358 to 359; Percent, 35

Lake level, 359 to 360; Percent, 5

Data given here are approximate.

The two histograms of lake levels were made from the same data set, and the histograms look identical in shape. The shape of the distribution of lake levels is skewed left, since the left side of the histogram is longer. The minimum lake level is 350 feet and the maximum is 359 feet. Using the histogram on the right, by adding the height of the bar for 358 and 359 feet elevations, we see the lake level is at 358 or 359 roughly 40% of the time. Using this information, it appears that a lake level of 357 feet is the midpoint of the distribution.

Let’s examine the difference in the two histograms. The histogram on the left puts the count of observations on the y axis (this is called a frequency histogram), while the histogram on the right uses the percent of times the lake reaches a certain level (this is called a relative frequency histogram). The frequency histogram tells us the lake reached an elevation of 358 feet approximately 24,000 times (24,041 to be exact!). If a fisherman considering a move to Lake Murray cares about how often the lake reaches a certain level, it is more illustrative to use the relative frequency histogram on the right, which reports the percent of times the lake reached 358 feet. The height of the bar for 358 feet is 35, so the fisherman would know the lake is at the 358-foot elevation roughly 35% of the time.

It is not uncommon in the current world to have very large data sets or「big data.」Google uses big data to rank web pages and provide the best search results. Banks use big data to analyze spending patterns and learn when to flag your debit or credit card for fraudulent use. Large firms use big data to analyze market patterns and adapt marketing strategies accordingly. Our data set of size 67,810 is actually small in the realm of「big data,」but still big enough to see that it is almost always better to use a relative frequency histogram when sample sizes grow large. A relative frequency histogram is also a better choice if one wants to make comparisons between two distributions.

Example 5

Shakespeare’s words

Figure 11.4 shows the distribution of lengths of words used in Shakespeare’s plays. This distribution has a single peak and is somewhat skewed to the right. There are many short words (3 and 4 letters) and few very long words (10, 11, or 12 letters), so that the right tail of the histogram extends out farther than the left tail. The center of the distribution is about 4. That is, about half of Shakespeare’s words have four or fewer letters. The variability is from 1 letter to 12 letters.

Figure 11.4 The distribution of word lengths used by Shakespeare in his plays, Example 5. This distribution is skewed to the right. Data from C. B. Williams, Style and Vocabulary: Numerical Studies, Griffin, 1970.

Data in the histogram are as follows:

Number of letters, 1; Percent, 4; Number of letters, 2; Percent, 17.5; Number of letters, 3; Percent, 23; Number of letters, 4; Percent, 24; Number of letters, 5; Percent, 12.5; Number of letters, 6; Percent, 7.5; Number of letters, 7; Percent, 6; Number of letters, 8; Percent, 3; Number of letters, 9; Percent, 1.5; Number of letters, 10; Percent, 0.2; Number of letters, 11; Percent, 0.1

Data given are approximate.

Notice that the vertical scale in Figure 11.4 is not the count of words but the percentage of all of Shakespeare’s words that have each length. A histogram of percentages rather than counts is convenient since this was a large data set. Different kinds of writing have different distributions of word lengths, but all are skewed to the right because short words are common and very long words are rare.

The overall shape of a distribution is important information about a variable. Some types of data regularly produce distributions that are symmetric or skewed. For example, the sizes of living things of the same species (like lengths of crickets) tend to be symmetric. Data on incomes (whether of individuals, companies, or nations) are usually strongly skewed to the right. There are many moderate incomes, some large incomes, and a few very large incomes. It is very common for data to be skewed to the right when they have a strict minimum value (often 0). Income and the lengths of Shakespeare’s words are examples. Likewise, data that have a strict maximum value (such as 100, as in student test scores) are often skewed to the left. Do remember that many distributions have shapes that are neither symmetric nor skewed. Some data show other patterns. Scores on an exam, for example, may have a cluster near the top of the scale if many students did well. Or they may show two distinct peaks if a tough problem divided the class into those who did and didn’t solve it. Use your eyes and describe what you see.

Now it’s your turn

11.2 Height distribution. Height distributions generally have a predictable pattern. In a large introductory statistics class, students were asked to report their height. The histogram in Figure 11.5 displays the distribution of heights, in inches, for 266 females from this class. Describe the shape, center, and variability of this distribution. Are there any outliers?

Figure 11.5 Heights in inches for 266 females in a large introductory statistics class.

Data in the histogram are as follows:

Height, 55 to 57; Number of females, blank

Height, 57 to 59; Number of females, 0.5,

Height, 59 to 61; Number of females, 8

Height, 61 to 63; Number of females, 50

Height, 63 to 65; Number of females, 67

Height, 65 to 67; Number of females, 72

Height, 67 to 69; Number of females, 42

Height, 69 to 71; Number of females, 24

Height, 71 to 73; Number of females, 8

Data given here are approximate.

Stemplots

Histograms are not the only graphical display of distributions. For small data sets, a stemplot (sometimes called a stem-and-leaf plot) is quicker to make and presents more detailed information.

A stemplot looks like a histogram turned on end. The stemplot in Figure 11.6 is just like the histogram in Figure 11.1 because the classes chosen for the histogram are the same as the stems in the stemplot. Figure 11.7 is a stemplot of the Illinois tuition data discussed in Example 3. This stemplot has almost six times as many classes as the histogram of the same data in Figure 11.2. We interpret stemplots as we do histograms, looking for the overall pattern and for any outliers.

Example 6

Stemplot of the「65 and older」data

For the「65-and-older」percentages in Table 11.1, the whole-number part of the observation is the stem, and the final digit (tenths) is the leaf. The Alabama entry, 13.8, has stem 13 and leaf 8. Stems can have as many digits as needed, but each leaf must consist of only a single digit. Figure 11.6 shows the steps in making a stemplot for the data in Table 11.1. First, write the stems. Then go through the table adding a leaf for each observation. Finally, arrange the leaves in increasing order out from each stem.

Figure 11.6 Making a stemplot of the 65-and-older data in Table 11.1. Whole percents form the stems, and tenths of a percent form the leaves.

The stem plot gives the following data:

Line 1: 7 | blank; 7 | 7; 7 | 7

Line 2: 8 | blank; 8 | blank; 8 | blank

Line 3: 9 | blank; 9 | 0; 9 | 0

Line 5: 11 | blank; 11 | 4; 11 | 4

Line 7: 13 | blank; 13 | 8 8 0 2 3 8 8 5 5 5 2 5 5 9 7 4 8; 13 | 0 2 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 7 8 8 8 8 8 9

Line 8: 14 | blank; 14 | 4 2 4 3 9 0 8 5 1 4 3 6; 14 | 0 1 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 6 8 9

Line 9: 15 | blank; 15 | 9 4; 15 | 4 9

Line 10: 16 | blank; 16 | 0; 16 | 0

Line 11: 17 | blank; 17 | 3; 17 | 3

An accompanying key reads, A stem of 7 and a leaf of 7 means 7.7 percent.

Stemplots

To make a stemplot:

Separate each observation into a stem consisting of all but the final (rightmost) digit and a leaf, the final digit. Stems may have as many digits as needed, but each leaf contains only a single digit. Do not include commas or decimal points with your leaves.

Write the stems in a vertical column with the smallest at the top, and draw a vertical line at the right of this column.

Write each leaf in the row to the right of its stem, in increasing order out from the stem.

You can choose the classes in a histogram. The classes (the stems) of a stemplot are given to you. You can get more flexibility by rounding the data so that the final digit after rounding is suitable as a leaf. Do this when the data have too many digits. For example, the tuition charges of Illinois colleges look like

A stemplot would have too many stems if we took all but the final digit as the stem and the final digit as the leaf. To make the stemplot in Figure 11.7, we round these data to the nearest hundred dollars:

These values appear in Figure 11.7 on the stems 4, 9, 13, and 25.

An accompanying key reads, A stem of 2 and a leaf of 1 means 2100 dollars.

The chief advantage of a stemplot is that it displays the actual values of the observations. We can see from the stemplot in Figure 11.7, but not from the histogram in Figure 11.2, that Illinois’s most expensive college charges $53,600 (rounded to the nearest hundred dollars). Stemplots are also faster to draw than histograms. A stemplot requires that we use the first digit or digits as stems. This amounts to an automatic choice of classes and can give a poor picture of the distribution. Stemplots do not work well with large data sets because the stems then have too many leaves.

Chapter 11 Summary and Exercises

Chapter 11: Statistics in Summary

The distribution of a variable tells us what values the variable takes and how often it takes each value.

To display the distribution of a quantitative variable, use a histogram or a stemplot. We usually favor stemplots when we have a small number of observations and histograms for larger data sets. Make sure to choose the appropriate number of classes so that the distribution shape is displayed accurately. For really large data sets, use a histogram of percents (relative frequency histogram).

When you look at a graph, look for an overall pattern and for deviations from that pattern, such as outliers.

We can characterize the overall pattern of a histogram or stemplot by describing its shape, center, and variability. Some distributions have simple shapes such as symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right, but others are too irregular to describe by a simple shape.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

Link It

In Chapter 10, we learned how to use tables and graphs to see what data tell us. In this chapter, we looked at two additional graphs, histograms and stemplots, that help us make sense of large collections of numbers. These graphics are pictures of the distribution of a single quantitative variable. Although the bar graphs in Chapter 10 look much like histograms, the difference is that bar graphs are used to display the distribution of a categorical variable, while histograms display the distribution of a quantitative variable. The overall pattern (shape, center, and variability) and deviations from this pattern (outliers) are important features of the distribution of a variable. We will look more carefully at these features in future chapters. In addition, these features will figure prominently in some of the conclusions that we will draw about a variable from data.

Case Study Evaluated

Use what you have learned in this chapter to evaluate the Case Study that opened the chapter. Start by reviewing the Chapter Summary. Then answer each of the following questions in complete sentences. Be sure to communicate clearly enough for any of your classmates to understand what you are saying.

Figure 11.8 is a histogram of the distribution of average rental prices of one-bedroom apartments from a sample of 85 U.S. cities.

Describe the overall shape, the center, and the variability of the distribution.

Are there any outliers?

In Dallas, Texas, the average rental price of a one-bedroom apartment is $1,190. Is this a low, high, or typical amount? Please explain.

The data that inspired this case study can be found on the following website: https://www.abodo.com/blog/2017-annual-rent-report/. Go to this website and scroll down to the bottom of the website to see a table of data. Find the 2017 average one-bedroom rental price for the location where you live, or for a location close to where you live. Is this average a low, high, or typical amount? Please explain.

11.9 Where do 18- to 44-year-olds live? Figure 11.11 is a stemplot of the percentage of residents aged 18 to 44 in each of the 50 states in 2010. As in Figure 11.6 (page 253) for older residents, the stems are whole percents and the leaves are tenths of a percent.

It turns out that Utah has the largest percentage of residents aged 18 to 44 years. What is the percentage for this state?

Describe the shape, center, and variability of this distribution.

Is the distribution for residents aged 18 to 44 years more or less variable than the distribution in Figure 11.6 for residents aged 65 and older?

From an examination of the stemplot, would it be possible to determine what percentage of residents aged 18 to 44 years lived in Arizona in 2010? Please explain why or why not.

11.10 The Super Bowl MVP. When the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl in 2017, Tom Brady, at 39 years of age, became the oldest player in National Football League (NFL) history to be named a Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (or MVP). Figure 11.12 is a histogram of the ages of players who have been named MVP for the first 52 Super Bowl games.

Briefly describe the shape, center, and variability of this distribution.

Does it appear that Tom Brady’s age would be an outlier in this distribution?

11.11 Returns on common stocks. The total return on a stock is the change in its market price plus any dividend payments made. Total return is usually expressed as a percentage of the beginning price. Figure 11.13 is a histogram of the distribution of total returns for all 1528 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange in one year.

Describe the overall shape of the distribution of total returns.

What is the approximate center of this distribution? Approximately what were the smallest and largest total returns? (This describes the variability of the distribution.)

A return less than zero means that owners of the stock lost money. About what percentage of all stocks lost money?

Explain why we prefer a histogram to a stemplot for describing the returns on 1528 common stocks.

11.12 The Kentucky Derby. On the first Saturday in May, the Kentucky Derby takes place at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. A total of 20 horses race in the Kentucky Derby, and they race around a track that is 1.25 miles long. Figure 11.14 shows the speeds (in miles per hour, or mph) for all 123 horses who have won the Kentucky Derby from 1896 through 2018.

Describe the shape, center, and variability of the distribution of speeds.

The 2018 winner of the Kentucky Derby was Justify. Justify had a speed of 36.23 mph. Is 36.23 mph a low, high, or typical amount in this distribution? Please explain.

11.13 Automobile fuel economy. Government regulations require automakers to give the city and highway gas mileages for each model of car. Table 11.2 gives the combined highway and city mileages (miles per gallon) for 31 model year 2015 sedans. Make a stemplot of the combined gas mileages of these cars. What can you say about the overall shape of the distribution? Where is the center (the value such that half the cars have better gas mileage and half have worse gas mileage)? Some of these cars are electric and the reported mileage is the electric equivalent. These cars have far higher mileage. How many electric cars are in this data set?

11.16 The statistics of writing style. Numerical data can distinguish different types of writing, and sometimes even individual authors. Here are data collected by students on the percentages of words of 1 to 15 letters used in articles in Popular Science magazine:

Length: 1 2 3 4 5

Percent: 3.6 14.8 18.7 16.0 12.5

Length: 6 7 8 9 10

Percent: 8.2 8.1 5.9 4.4 3.6

Length: 11 12 13 14 15

Percent: 2.1 0.9 0.6 0.4 0.2

Make a histogram of this distribution. Describe its shape, center, and variability.

How does the distribution of lengths of words used in Popular Science compare with the similar distribution in Figure 11.4 (page 251) for Shakespeare’s plays? Look in particular at short words (2, 3, and 4 letters) and very long words (more than 10 letters).

11.17 What’s my shape? There are 30 teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and each team has a team payroll. The team payroll consists of the total amount of money available to pay all players on the team. As an example, in the 2018–19 season, the LA Lakers had a team payroll of $107,020,840. Suppose you were able to look at the distribution of team payrolls for all 30 teams in the NBA during the 2018–19 season. Would you expect this distribution to be roughly symmetric, clearly skewed to the right, or clearly skewed to the left? Why?

11.18 The Asian population in the eastern states. When the 2010 census was published, it was reported that the Asian population grew faster than any other race group in the United States during the decade from 2000 to 2010. Here are the percentages of the population who are of Asian origin in each state east of the Mississippi River in 2010:

State Percent State Percent State Percent

Alabama 1.1 Connecticut 3.8 Delaware 3.2

Florida 2.4 Georgia 3.2 Illinois 4.6

Indiana 1.6 Kentucky 1.1 Maine 1.0

Pennsylvania 2.7 Rhode Island 2.9 South Carolina 1.3

Tennessee 1.4 Vermont 1.3 Virginia 5.5

West Virginia 0.7 Wisconsin 2.3

Make a stemplot of these data. Describe the overall pattern of the distribution. Are there any outliers?

11.19 How many calories does a hot dog have? Consumer Reports magazine presented the following data on the number of calories in a hot dog for each of 17 brands of meat hot dogs:

173 191 182 190 172 147 146 139 175

136 179 153 107 195 135 140 138

Make a stemplot of the distribution of calories in meat hot dogs and briefly describe the shape of the distribution. Most brands of meat hot dogs contain a mixture of beef and pork, with up to 15% poultry allowed by government regulations. The only brand with a different makeup was Eat Slim Veal Hot Dogs. Which point on your stemplot do you think represents this brand?

11.20 The changing age distribution of the United States. The distribution of the ages of a nation’s population has a strong influence on economic and social conditions. Table 11.5 shows the age distribution of U.S. residents in 1950 and 2050, in millions of persons. The 1950 data come from that year’s census. The 2050 data are projections made by the Census Bureau.

Because the total population in 2050 is much larger than the 1950 population, comparing percentages in each age group is clearer than comparing counts. Make a table of the percentage of the total population in each age group for both 1950 and 2050.

Make a histogram of the 1950 age distribution (in percents). Then describe the main features of the distribution. In particular, look at the percentage of children relative to the rest of the population.

Make a histogram of the projected age distribution for the year 2050. Use the same scales as in (b) for easy comparison. What are the most important changes in the U.S. age distribution projected for the 100-year period between 1950 and 2050?

Table 11.5 Age distribution in the United States, 1950 and 2050 (in millions of persons)

11.21 Babe Ruth’s home runs. Here are the numbers of home runs that Babe Ruth hit in his 15 years with the New York Yankees, 1920 to 1934:

54 59 35 41 46 25 47 60

54 46 49 46 41 34 22

Make a stemplot of these data. Is the distribution roughly symmetric, clearly skewed, or neither? About how many home runs did Ruth hit in a typical year? Is his famous 60 home runs in 1927 an outlier?

11.22 Back-to-back stemplot. The current major league single-season home run record is held by Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants. Here are Bonds’s home run counts for 1986 to 2007:

16 25 24 19 33 25 34 46

37 33 42 40 37 34 49 73

46 45 45 5 26 28

A back-to-back stemplot helps us compare two distributions. Write the stems as usual, but with a vertical line both to their left and to their right. On the right, put leaves for Ruth (Exercise 11.21). On the left, put leaves for Bonds. Arrange the leaves on each stem in increasing order out from the stem. Now write a brief comparison of Ruth and Bonds as home run hitters.

11.23 When it rains, it pours. On July 25 to 26, 1979, 42.00 inches of rain fell on Alvin, Texas. That’s the most rain ever recorded in Texas for a 24-hour period. Table 11.6 gives the maximum precipitation ever recorded in 24 hours (through 2010) at any weather station in each state. The record amount varies a great deal from state to state—hurricanes bring extreme rains on the Atlantic coast, and the mountain West is generally dry.

Make a graph to display the distribution of records for the states. Mark where your state lies in this distribution. Briefly describe the distribution in terms of shape, center, and variability.

In April 2018, it was reported that 49.69 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period on the island of Kauai, in Hawaii. If we change the precipitation amount for Hawaii, in Table 11.6, from 38.00 inches to 49.69 inches, how does this impact the distribution of records for the states? In other words, would your description of shape, center, and variability from part (b) need to be modified? Please explain.

11.24 What’s wrong? The Economic Research Service (ERS) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) uses information from different retail establishments to provide estimates of the average price per pound (in dollars) of different fruits and vegetables. These prices are used when publishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in order to show individuals how much it will cost them to maintain a healthy diet. Figure 11.15 shows the distribution of the estimated average prices per pound, in 2016, of 58 fruits and vegetables. Each of the following descriptions of this distribution is incorrect. Explain what is wrong with each description.

The distribution is skewed to the left since most of the estimated average prices are on the left side of the histogram.

A majority of the estimated average prices are between $1.00 and $1.50.

We can see, by looking along the x axis, that estimated average prices start low at the beginning of 2016 and get higher later in 2016.

There are five fruits and vegetables with estimated average prices of exactly $3.00 per pound.

Figure 11.15 Histogram of the average estimated prices (in dollars) of 58 fruits and vegetables in 2016.

Data in the histogram are as follows:

Average price, 0 to 0.5; Frequency, 1

Average price, 0.5 to 1; Frequency, 8

Average price, 1 to 1.5; Frequency, 17

Average price, 1.5 to 2; Frequency, 7
