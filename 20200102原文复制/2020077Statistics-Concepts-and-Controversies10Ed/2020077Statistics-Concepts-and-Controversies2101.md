The reason we collect data is not to learn about the individuals that we observed but to infer from the data to some wider population that the individuals represent. Chapters 1 through 6 tell us that the way we produce the data (sampling, experimental design) affects whether we have a good basis for generalizing to some wider population—in particular, whether a sample statistic provides insight into the value of the corresponding population parameter. Chapters 17 through 20 discuss probability, the formal mathematical tool that determines the nature of the inferences we make. Chapter 18 discusses sampling distributions, which tell us how statistics computed from repeated SRSs behave and hence what a statistic (in particular, a sample proportion) computed from our sample is likely to tell us about the corresponding parameter of the population (in particular, a population proportion) from which the sample was selected.

In this chapter, we discuss the basic reasoning of statistical estimation of a population parameter, with emphasis on estimating a population proportion and population mean. To an estimate of a population parameter, such as a population proportion, we attach a margin of error and a confidence level. The result is a confidence interval. The sampling distribution, first introduced in Chapter 3 and discussed more fully in Chapter 18, provides the mathematical basis for constructing confidence intervals and understanding their properties. We will provide more advice on interpreting confidence intervals in Chapter 23.

Case Study Evaluated

Use what you have learned in this chapter to evaluate the Case Study described at the beginning of the chapter. Start by reviewing the Chapter Summary. Then answer each of the following questions in complete sentences. Be sure to communicate clearly enough for any of your classmates to understand what you are saying. Based on the information provided in the Pew Research Center report, we can construct confidence intervals. For example, with 95% confidence, between 64.7% and 77.3% of 18- to 24-year-olds use Instagram and between 72.3% and 83.7% of 18- to 24-year-olds use Snapchat.

Interpret the above confidence intervals in plain language that someone who knows no statistics will understand.

Suppose we wanted to use information from the entire sample of 2002 survey respondents in order to construct a 95% confidence interval to estimate the true population percentage of Instagram users. Would you expect the margin of error for this confidence interval to be larger than, smaller than, or the same as the margin of error for the 95% confidence interval based on the sample of 201 18- to 24-year-olds? Explain your reasoning.

In this chapter you have:

Learned how to construct confidence intervals for proportions and means.

Interpreted what confidence intervals represent.

21.4 Gun ownership. In 2017, the Pew Research Center published the results of a survey on gun ownership. A random sample of 3930 American adults aged 18 years and older participated in this survey. Of these 3930 individuals, 1269 individuals reported that they owned at least one gun. Of these self-reported gun owners, 850 said the reason they owned a gun was for protection. Based on this information, we know the sample proportion, , of gun owners from this survey who own a gun for protection is

Of the 374 individuals in this age group, 176 indicated that cost was the biggest barrier when it comes to traveling. Based on this information, the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all adults in this age group who find cost to be the biggest barrier to travel would be

A nationally representative sample of 1601 people ages 16 and older who were living in the United States completed the survey. One survey question asked whether the survey respondent had visited, in person, a library or a bookmobile in the last year. A total of 768 of those surveyed answered「yes」to this question.

Explain briefly what your results show about the effect of increasing the size of a sample on the width of the confidence interval.

21.17 Random digits. We know that the proportion of 0s among a large set of random digits is because all 10 possible digits are equally probable. The entries in a table of random digits are a random sample from the population of all random digits. To get an SRS of 200 random digits, look at the first digit in each of the 200 five-digit groups in lines 101 to 125 of Table A in the back of the book. How many of these 200 digits are 0s? Give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of 0s in the population from which these digits are a random sample. Does your interval cover the true parameter value, ?

Use the result of your tosses to give a 95% confidence interval for . Write a brief explanation of your findings for someone who knows no statistics but wonders how often a thumbtack will land point up.

21.19 Don’t forget the basics. Vaping involves inhaling vapors (sometimes including nicotine) from electronic devices. How prevalent is this practice among high school seniors? In 2017, a publication entitled「Monitoring the Future: National Survey Results on Drug Use」reported that of 13,500 high school seniors who were surveyed, 35.8% indicated that they had tried vaping at some point in their lives. We can use this information to construct a confidence interval for the proportion of all high school seniors who have ever tried vaping. However, this sample survey may have bias that our confidence interval does not take into account.

Why is some bias likely to be present?

Does the sample proportion 35.8% probably overestimate or underestimate the true population proportion? Please explain.

If 35.8% of the 13,500 high school seniors reported they had tried vaping, this means the actual number of students who reported they had tried vaping must be equal to what?

21.21 Share the wealth. The New York Times conducted a nationwide poll of 1650 randomly selected American adults. Of these, 1089 felt that the distribution of money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among more people. We can consider the sample to be an SRS.

Give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all American adults who, at the time of the poll, felt that the distribution of money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among more people.

The news article says,「In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the poll results will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.」Explain how your results agree with this statement.

21.22 Harley motorcycles. In 2013, it was reported that 55% of the new motorcycles that were registered in the United States were Harley-Davidson motorcycles. You plan to interview an SRS of 600 new motorcycle owners.

What is the sampling distribution of the proportion of your sample who own Harleys?

How likely is your sample to contain 57% or more who own Harleys? How likely is it to contain at least 51% Harley owners? Use the 68–95–99.7 rule and your answer to part (a).

21.23 Do you jog? Suppose that 10% of all adults jog. An opinion poll asks an SRS of 400 adults if they jog.

What is the sampling distribution of the proportion in the sample who jog?

According to the 68–95–99.7 rule, what is the probability that the sample proportion who jog will be 7.3% or greater?

21.24 The quick method. The quick method of Chapter 3 (pages 43–44) uses as a rough recipe for a 95% confidence interval for a population proportion. The margin of error from the quick method is a bit larger than needed. It differs most from the more accurate method of this chapter when is close to 0 or 1. An SRS of 500 motorcycle registrations finds that 68 of the motorcycles are Harley-Davidsons. Give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all motorcycles that are Harleys by the quick method and then by the method of this chapter. How much larger is the quick-method margin of error?

21.25 68% confidence. We used the 95 part of the 68–95–99.7 rule to give a recipe for a 95% confidence interval for a population proportion .

Use the 68 part of the rule to give a recipe for a 68% confidence interval.

Explain in simple language what「68% confidence」means.

21.26 Simulating confidence intervals. In Exercise 21.25, you found the recipe for a 68% confidence interval for a population proportion . Suppose that (unknown to anyone) 20% of college seniors plan to go to graduate or professional school.

How would you simulate the proportion of an SRS of 25 college seniors?

Simulate choosing 10 SRSs, using a different row in Table A for each sample. What are the 10 values of the sample proportion who plan to go to graduate or professional school?

Find the 68% confidence interval for from each of your 10 samples. How many of the intervals capture the true parameter value ? (Samples of size 25 are not large enough for our recipe to be very accurate, but even a small simulation illustrates how confidence intervals behave in repeated samples.)

The following exercises concern the optional sections of this chapter.

21.27 Gun control. Exercise 21.12 reports a Gallup survey in which 697 of a sample of 1041 adults said they wanted stricter laws covering the sale of firearms. Use Table 21.1 to give a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of all adults who feel this way. How does your interval compare with the 95% confidence interval from Exercise 21.12?

21.28 Using public libraries. Exercise 21.13 reports a 2016 Pew Research Center survey on public library usage in which 768 in a sample of 1601 American adults said that they had visited, in person, a library or bookmobile in the last year. Use Table 21.1 to give a 99% confidence interval for the proportion of all American adults who have done this. How does your interval compare with the 95% confidence interval of Exercise 21.13?

21.29 Restaurant nutrition labels. A 2018 Gallup survey on food labeling found that 45% of a sample of 1033 American adults report paying a great deal or a fair amount of attention to nutritional information that is printed on restaurant menus or posted in restaurants. Use this survey result and Table 21.1 to give 70%, 80%, 90%, and 99% confidence intervals for the proportion of all adult Americans who pay a great deal or a fair amount of attention to this information. What do your results show about the effect of changing the confidence level?

21.30 Unhappy HMO patients. How likely are patients who file complaints with a health maintenance organization (HMO) to leave the HMO? In one year, 639 of the more than 400,000 members of a large New England HMO filed complaints. Fifty-four of the complainers left the HMO voluntarily. (That is, they were not forced to leave by a move or a job change.) Consider this year’s complainers as an SRS of all patients who will complain in the future. Give a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of complainers who voluntarily leave the HMO.

21.31 Estimating unemployment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses 90% confidence in presenting unemployment results from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). The November 2018 survey reported that of the 162,770 individuals surveyed in the civilian labor force, 156,795 were employed and 5975 were unemployed. The CPS is not an SRS, but for the purposes of this exercise, we will act as though the BLS took an SRS of 162,770 people. Give a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of those surveyed who were unemployed. (Note: Example 3 in Chapter 8 on pages 164 explains how unemployment is measured.)

21.32 Safe margin of error. The margin of error is 0 when is 0 or 1 and is largest when is 1/2. To see this, calculate for = 0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9, and 1. Plot your results vertically against the values of horizontally. Draw a curve through the points. You have made a graph of . Does the graph reach its highest point when ? You see that taking gives a margin of error that is always at least as large as needed.

21.33 The idea of a sampling distribution. Figure 21.1 (page 489) shows the idea of the sampling distribution of a sample proportion in picture form. Draw a similar picture that shows the idea of the sampling distribution of a sample mean .

21.34 IQ test scores. Here are the IQ test scores of 31 seventh-grade students in a Midwest school district:

114 100 104 89 102 91 114 114 103 105

108 130 120 132 111 128 118 119 86 72

111 103 74 112 107 103 98 96 112 112 93

We expect the distribution of IQ scores to be close to Normal. Make a histogram of the distribution of these 31 scores. Does your plot show outliers, clear skewness, or other non-Normal features? Using a calculator, find the mean and standard deviation of these scores.

Treat the 31 students as an SRS of all middle-school students in the school district. Give a 95% confidence interval for the mean score in the population.

In fact, the scores are those of all seventh-grade students in one of the several schools in the district. Explain carefully why we cannot trust the confidence interval from (b).

21.35 Averages versus individuals. Scores on the ACT college entrance examination vary Normally with mean and standard deviation . The range of reported scores is 1 to 36.

What range contains the middle 95% of all individual scores?

If the ACT scores of 50 randomly selected students are averaged, what range contains the middle 95% of the averages ?

21.36 Blood pressure. A randomized comparative experiment studied the effect of diet on blood pressure. Researchers divided 54 healthy white males at random into two groups. One group received a calcium supplement, and the other group received a placebo. At the beginning of the study, the researchers measured many variables on the subjects. The average seated systolic blood pressure of the 27 members of the placebo group was reported to be with a standard deviation of .

Give a 95% confidence interval for the mean blood pressure of the population from which the subjects were recruited.

The recipe you used in part (a) requires an important assumption about the 27 men who provided the data. What is this assumption?

21.37 Testing a random number generator. Our statistical software has a「random number generator」that is supposed to produce numbers scattered at random from 0 to 1. If this is true, the numbers generated come from a population with . A command to generate 100 random numbers gives outcomes with mean and . Give a 90% confidence interval for the mean of all numbers produced by the software.

21.38 Will they charge more? A bank wonders whether omitting the annual credit card fee for customers who charge at least $2500 in a year will increase the amount charged on its credit cards. The bank makes this offer to an SRS of 200 of its credit card customers. It then compares how much these customers charge this year with the amount that they charged last year. The mean increase in the sample is $346, and the standard deviation is $112. Give a 99% confidence interval for the mean amount charges would have increased if this benefit had been extended to all such customers.

21.39 A sampling distribution. Exercise 21.37 concerns the mean of the random numbers generated by a computer program. The mean is supposed to be 0.5 because the numbers are supposed to be spread at random from 0 to 1. We asked the software to generate samples of 100 random numbers repeatedly. Here are the sample means for 50 samples of size 100:

0.532 0.450 0.481 0.508 0.510 0.530 0.499 0.461 0.543 0.490

0.497 0.552 0.473 0.425 0.449 0.507 0.472 0.438 0.527 0.536

0.492 0.484 0.498 0.536 0.492 0.483 0.529 0.490 0.548 0.439

0.473 0.516 0.534 0.540 0.525 0.540 0.464 0.507 0.483 0.436

0.497 0.493 0.458 0.527 0.458 0.510 0.498 0.480 0.479 0.499

The sampling distribution of is the distribution of the means from all possible samples. We actually have the means from 50 samples. Make a histogram of these 50 sample means. Does the distribution appear to be roughly Normal, as the central limit theorem says will happen for large enough samples?

21.40 Will they charge more? In Exercise 21.38, you carried out the calculations for a confidence interval based on a bank’s experiment in changing the rules for its credit cards. You ought to ask some questions about this study.

The distribution of the amount charged is skewed to the right, but outliers are prevented by the credit limit that the bank enforces on each card. Why can we use a confidence interval based on a Normal sampling distribution for the sample mean ?

The bank’s experiment was not comparative. The increase in amount charged over last year may be explained by lurking variables rather than by the rule change. What are some plausible reasons charges might go up? Outline the design of a comparative randomized experiment to answer the bank’s question.

21.41 A sampling distribution, continued. Exercise 21.39 presents 50 sample means from 50 random samples of size 100. Using a calculator, find the mean and standard error of these 50 values. Then answer these questions.

The mean of the population from which the 50 samples were drawn is if the random number generator is accurate. What do you expect the mean of the distribution of ’s from all possible samples to be? Is the mean of these 50 samples close to this value?

The standard error of the distribution of from samples of size is supposed to be , where is the standard deviation of individuals in the population. Use this fact and the standard deviation you calculated for the 50 ’s to estimate .

21.42 Plus four confidence intervals for a proportion. The large-sample confidence interval for a sample proportion is easy to calculate. It is also easy to understand because it rests directly on the approximately Normal distribution of . Unfortunately, confidence levels from this interval can be inaccurate, particularly with smaller sample sizes where there are only a few successes or a few failures. The actual confidence level is usually less than the confidence level you asked for in choosing the critical value . That’s bad. What is worse, accuracy does not consistently get better as the sample size increases. There are「lucky」and「unlucky」combinations of the sample size and the true population proportion .

Fortunately, there is a simple modification that is almost magically effective in improving the accuracy of the confidence interval. We call it the「plus four」method because all you need to do is add four imaginary observations, two successes and two failures. With the added observations, the plus four estimate of is

The formula for the confidence interval is exactly as before, with the new sample size and number of successes. To practice using the plus four confidence interval, consider the following problem. Cocaine users commonly snort the powder up the nose through a rolled-up paper currency bill. Spain has a high rate of cocaine use, so it’s not surprising that euro paper currency in Spain often shows traces of cocaine. Researchers collected 20 euro bills in each of several Spanish cities. In Madrid, 17 out of 20 bore traces of cocaine. The researchers note that we can’t tell whether the bills had been used to snort cocaine or had been contaminated in currency-sorting machines. Use the plus four confidence interval method to estimate the proportion of all euro bills in Madrid that have traces of cocaine.
