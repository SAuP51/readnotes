This is a valid probability model because all possible outcomes are listed, each individual probability is between 0 and 1, and all the probabilities sum up to 1.

WTV20.1 .

WTV20.2 .

WTV20.3 Yes, because the expected value is positive. But this ignores the possibility of splitting the jackpot if there are multiple winners.

WTV20.4 .

WTV20.5 Between and million. This suggests that when the jackpot exceeds this value, the expected value in your wallet will be positive, ignoring the possibility of splitting the jackpot.

WTV20.6 Answers will vary.

Chapter 23

WTV23.1 No, they did not take sampling variability into account. They are only using sample statistics to do the comparison.

WTV23.2 The hosts are attempting to explain what is true for the population, but they only used a sample of 50 people total (with 2/3 going into the yawn seed group), so sampling variability needs to be taken into account.

WTV23.3 This is doubtful because 25% and 29% are very close together, and the sample size, particularly in the no yawn seed group, was not very large.

WTV23.4 Less. With a very small sample size, individual quirks are likely to make a difference to the results. Maybe the person in the yawn seed group did not sleep well the night before, but the no yawn seed person did sleep well. The results would likely not be statistically significant even if yawning truly is contagious because the sample size is so small.

WTV23.5 A very large sample size like this makes most results look statistically significant whether they are practically significant or not.

WTV23.6 Since a simple random sample was not used, it is likely that this sample will not represent the whole population. These people responded to an ad to be on MythBusters, so perhaps they are more likely to be actors or people who work nights (and therefore have their days free to appear on the show) or unemployed or retired people.

Page 272 This description of the boxplot is sometimes referred to as a simple boxplot. More complicated versions of boxplots exist and are sometimes referred to as modified boxplots. Most statistical software packages produce modified boxplots. Modified boxplots extend lines out from the boxes to (i) the larger of either the smallest observation or the value , and to (ii) the smaller of the largest observation or the value . Any observations outside these limits are considered outliers and indicated by separate points on the plot.

Page 415 The presentation of personal probability and long-term proportion as distinct ideas is influenced by psychological research that appears to show that people judge single-case questions differently from distributional or relative frequency questions. At least some of the biases found in the classic work of Tversky and Kahneman on our perception of chance seem to disappear when it is made clear to subjects which interpretation is intended. This is a complex area and SCC is a simple book, but we judged it somewhat behind the times to put too much emphasis on the Tversky-Kahneman findings. See Gerd Gigerenzer,「How to make cognitive illusions disappear: beyond heuristics and biases,」in Wolfgang Stroebe and Miles Hewstone (eds.), European Review of Social Psychology, Vol. 2, Wiley, 1991, pp. 83–115.

The text on the back cover reads, About the Cover Data visualization, the process of putting data into visual form, allows us to grasp and digest complex information. Our cover shows a snapshot of a graphical display from the Gapminder website (http://www.gapminder.org/tools) that illustrates the relationship between income per person (x) and life expectancy in years (y) for many countries around the world. Each bubble represents a different country; color indicates the country’s region. Bubble size is proportional to the population size of the country.

The Gapminder website allows us to make similar plots for each of several years; in each plot, we see that as income per person goes up, life expectancy goes up. When these plots are compared, we see this upward relationship holds for each of the different bubble sizes and each of the different colors. We also see that people are living longer now than in previous years regardless of income.

To learn more about Gapminder and its founders’ philosophy, see Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling, with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250107817.
