## 0101. Alternative Visions of Rationality

0101 如何看待理性

乐观主义者认为，如果我们思考得足够深入、足够理性，那么我们就能够解决我们所面临的所有问题。18 世纪的理性时代，据说就充斥着这种乐观主义。事实是否如此？我们还是留给历史学家来回答吧。至于我们目前所处的社会，则肯定没有那么乐观。

本文旨在立足当今社会，探讨理性在人类生活中的作用和局限性。为了避免上述不靠谱的乐观主义，第一、二讲将以理性的有限性而不是理性的作用，作为论述的重点。第三讲会适当恢复二者之间的平衡，但同时也希望大家通过本文的结构安排能够理解，我们为何会先探讨理性的有限性问题。只有充分理解了理性的有限性，我们才能够设计出适当的机制，以有效利用人类推理能力所赋予我们的力量。

在第一讲中，我们首先分析功能强大的正式理性模型。这些模型构建于 20 世纪，被视为我们这个时代最宝贵的智力成果之一。由于人们对这些模型已经非常熟悉，故我们不拟详尽阐述，而以更多的篇幅，探讨将它们应用于人类现实生活时，何以盛名难副。当然，我们的本意并非吹毛求疵。第一讲后半部分将对人类有限理性做出更切合实际的阐释，并考察有限理性所提供的有限分析能力，能够在何种程度上满足人们在现实生活中的推理需要。

第二讲所考察的问题，如今更多地属于社会生物学范畴，即冷酷的自然选择理性能否矫正理性自身的缺陷。其中，有两个问题值得予以特别的关注：其一，在自然选择面前，是否存在以及在多大程度上存在利他主义？其二，自然选择过程在何种程度上类似于最优化过程？

以第一、二讲的基本结论为基础，我们将转向第三个问题，即：在人类社会事务中，如何才能够有效地利用人类的理性？

科学应该提供新的真理。学术论文最令人崩溃的审阅意见，是在审阅报告的空白处留下这样几个字：「有新意的地方都是不对的，而对的地方又毫无新意」（What's new here is not true,. And what's true is not new.）。本文并不打算写成学术报告，故并不刻意追求新鲜感。如果我所讲的内容大部分是对的，那么即使它们不是全新的，我也感到欣慰了。正如我在讨论人类理性时所认为的那样，隔三差五地回顾一下重要的旧真理，还是蛮有必要的。

另外，对于我在早期著作中已经详细讨论过的问题，本文也不打算简单地重复论述。尤其是《管理行为》（Administrative Behavior）和《人工科学》（The Sciences of the Artificial）两本著作，都曾对人类理性的基本概念做过深入的讨论。其中，《管理行为》重点考察了人类有限理性对组织行为的影响，而《人工科学》则描述了所有的适应性系统（人工系统）所具有的共同特征，并以之作为构建人工系统通用理论的基础。对于这些早期著作，本文以能够为进一步讨论提供基本框架为限。本文探讨的重点，则是在我们理解理性在人类生活中的作用方面，仍然有待解决、充满争议和极其重要的那些问题。其实，我已经简要提及了若干有待解决的问题。

1.1 理性的有限性

阿基米德（Archimedes）的现代传人，仍在寻找撬动整个世界的支点。在推理方面，寻找支点的难点仍在于「没有前提就没有结论」（no conclusions without premises）这一老生常谈。理性推理过程接收符号性输入项，并得出符号性输出项。公理是初始输入项，它本身不能从逻辑中推导出来，但可以简单地从经验观察中归纳，或更简单地假设之。不仅如此，输入项与输出项之间的转换过程（推断规则），还可能经由判决而来，而不是推理的结果。公理和推断规则，共同构成了支撑推理杠杆的支点；不过，我们却不能用推理的方法来判断该支点的具体结构是否合理，因为如果要进行这种判断，就必然包含一系列的逻辑性倒推，而倒推中每一步的逻辑基础具有随意性。

这种随意性是破坏推理过程从而损及推理结果的一种原罪。对于我们讨论的主题而言，这种难以消除的随意性会造成如下两个重要后果。

首先，它永远无法得出一种无懈可击的归纳原理，使得我们能够从一个具体事件甚至无数事件中，推导出没有失误风险或绝对可靠的一般规律。任何一个看见过白天鹅的人，都不能保证下一次看到的天鹅不是黑的。甚至对于我们能否做出一种确切的概率性陈述，也是一个充满争议的话题：我个人认为，对此持否定态度的人应该远多于赞成者。

进一步讲，构成归纳之基础的事件，有赖于复杂甚至不稳定的观察、感知和推断。事件（尤其是科学事件）的收集，通常需要借助某些工具，而这些工具本身却处处隐含着理论假设。没有任何一台显微镜，不包含哪怕最基本的光学理论；没有哪个人的口头报告，不包含某种短期记忆理论。因此，推理的不可靠性，既源自从具体事件中产生无懈可击的一般规律的不可能性，又源于事件本身所具有的不确切性和理论过滤属性。

其次，「没有前提就没有结论」原理永远无法得出规范性陈述（即包含「应该」的陈述，其推导过程独立于那些同样包含「应该」字样的输入项）。在人们接受的推断规则中，没有哪种规则能够单纯地从描述性输入项中得到规范性的输出项。1「没有前提就没有结论」的必然结果是「单单由（是什么）无法得到（应该如何）」。因此，尽管理性是我们在探寻实现目标的相应手段时的强大工具，但它却无法对目标本身提供任何帮助。

1 艾尔（Ayer）多年前已对此做过精彩论述，本文不再赘述。参见 Ayer, Language, Truth, and Logic,rev.ed. (New York,1946), chap.6.

推理过程还存在最后一个困难，此即最早由哥德尔（Gδdl）提出的逻辑体系的不完备性：一个逻辑体系无论多么完善，总会存在某些命题，仅仅通过对输入项的合理变换无法得出最终结果。对人类生活中的理性而言，逻辑不完备性问题远没有前面两个问题重要，故本文不拟做进一步讨论。对于逻辑公理和推断规则本身是否具有某种随意性，本文亦不做进一步讨论。为便于讨论，后文将视之为不存在任何问题的。

于是，在有了一组合适的输入项或前提之后，理性就可以开始发挥作用了。如果我们用理性来探寻或选择行动方案，那么有关输入项至少应该包括：一组「应该怎样」（should's）的命题或欲实现的价值，一组「是什么」（it's）的命题或关于拟采取行动所处环境的基本事实。任何试图用「逻辑」来判断「应该怎样」和「是什么」命题的合理性的尝试，必然会重新回到一组新的「应该怎样」和「是什么」命题。

1.2 价值观

我们完全工具性地看待理性。它不能告诉我们到哪里去，最多只能告诉我们如何去。它就像职业杀手，不管我们的目标是什么，也不论其好坏，都可以雇它来达到目标。究竟把我们面临的难题归咎于罪恶还是无知和非理性 —— 是目标的卑劣，还是我们不知道如何实现它，对于我们如何看待人类生存状况会有很大的不同。

道尺魔丈

对于理性之作用的有限性，一种略离谱但比较有用的思维训练方式，是尝试阅读希特勒（Hitler）的《我的奋斗》（Mein Kampf）。这是一个孤立的个案，也比较容易惹来争议。这种思维训练可能令人不快，但却能够揭示出我们在思考人类生活时，客观事实、价值观念和个人情感如何发生相互作用。我之所以拿它做例子，是因为同意该书中的某些观点，并不会削弱读者朋友们的批判能力。

我们大多数人不会同意希特勒所谓的「事实」，特别是他对欧洲经济困境的分析，如他所宣称的犹太人和马克思主义者（他还误认为二者没有什么区别）是经济困境的根源等。不过，倘若我们暂不考虑我们的置疑，而假定希特勒所说的「事实」是真的，那么就可以看到大部分纳粹计划，都是同德国的国家安全目标甚至德国人民的福祉高度一致的。到这一点为止，我们不能接受这些纳粹计划，并不是因为其目标的罪恶性（没有人认为关心德国人民的福祉是不对的），也不是因为根据目标进行的推理是错误的；我们只能从连接目标和计划之间的实际假设的不可接受性方面，来寻找不能接受纳粹计划的原因。由此观之，我们要想批驳纳粹主义，就必须通过基于更真实的前提的理性推断，来反击纳粹计划。

不过，这种平静的反应，在某种程度上并不足以匹配《我的奋斗》带给我们的愤怒，必定还存在其他可以批驳有关论点的东西。说得委婉一点，纳粹主义的目标是不完备的。人们在阐述人类目标时，通常把人类分为「我们」和「他们」。其中，「我们」指的是目标对象，而「他们」的福祉则并不是「我们」的主要关注对象。希特勒的「我们」指的是德国人民，对「我们」的定义是基于以雅利安人和非雅利安人的基因差异为基础的、不靠谱的「事实」。即便抛开关于纯正日耳曼人的这种幻觉，我们大多数人对「我们」的定义仍然不同于希特勒。我们的「我们」或许是美国人而非德国人，或者如果我们达到了 21 世纪的启蒙水平，我们的「我们」甚至会是全体人类。不论在哪种情形下，我们与希特勒之间都会不可避免地陷入价值观冲突，并且不论是改善「事实」还是改进「推理」，都不可能解决这一冲突。我们关于「我们」（我们关注他人时的边界）的假定，是我们分辨善恶的一个基本假设。

《我的奋斗》所产生的最大愤怒感，或许来自于希特勒划分「我们」和「他们」时的边界清晰度。希特勒不仅优先考虑「我们」，而且认为无论如何对待「他们」，无论多么暴力血腥，只要有助于实现「我们」的目标就都是正当合理的。即使能够接受希特勒的一般性目标和他所宣称的「事实」，我们绝大多数人仍然会反对他为了滋养「我们」的福利而强加在「他们」身上的措施。在我们的价值观体系中，如果我们不能把「他们」视为毫无权利的群体，那么理性就会向我们展示出价值观方面的冲突，即我们关于有利于「我们」的价值观与我们关于不能伤害「他们」的一般目标之间的冲突。因此，我们对《我的奋斗》的驳斥，不在于它的推理有问题，而在于它所宣称的「事实」及其无法容忍的价值观。

在《我的奋斗》中，我们还可以得到另一个教训。在发现希特勒的推理不是「冷推理」而是「热推理」之前，该书实在是难以卒读。我们早就知道，对于充满激情和漫骂的慷慨陈词，有必要对它的前提和推论予以格外谨慎的审视。我们知道这一点，但难以自始至终地付诸实践。令人遗憾的是，当激情和漫骂引发出我们内在情感的共鸣时，我们恰恰会忘记警告，成为毫无批判能力的读者或听众。

对于德国人来说，希特勒确实是一个卓越的雄辩家，因为他的激情和漫骂，能够引发许多德国人心中早已存在的信念和价值观的共鸣。他热烈的言辞，使得他的读者失去在其观点中应用理性和证据规则的能力。与希特勒宣称的事实和价值观产生共鸣的德国人并非个案，许多暗中反犹太主义和公开反共产主义的西方政客，也会把自己的不少观点包装得动听感人。

我们从痛苦的经历和最初判断的挫折中认识到，我们不能把希特勒当作疯子，因为他在他的疯狂中自有他的方法。希特勒的行为符合理性标准，与我们在写作说服性论文时所习惯的做法相比，既不高也不低。理性并不是也不应该是我们抵御纳粹主义的主要盾牌。我们的主要盾牌是同纳粹主义截然不同的信念和价值观。

各有所好

尽管我们有必要认识到，对理性的运用（「冷推理」或「热推理」）存在诸多复杂性，且单单从「是什么」之中并不能推导出「应该怎样」，但我们仍必须承认对行为进行推理的可能性。对于绝大多数「应该怎样」的问题来说，我们所信奉的「应该怎样」并不是最终的行为标准，而是子目标，它作为实现其他目标的手段被我们采用。例如，孤立地看，把「量入为出」作为目标似乎是毋庸置疑的，但一个学生为完成他或她的学业而适度负债或许是更好的做法。这种教育负债完全不同于赌债，它其实是一种对未来生产力的投资。

在下面几种情况下，价值观的确会有争议：1）当满足它们会对其他价值观念（不管是现在还是在未来）产生影响时；2）当它们是后天获得的；3）当它们有助于更多最终价值观念的实现时。不过，尽管人们对适用于实际问题的推理规则达成了广泛的共识，但过去数百年来的情形表明，适用于相互影响的价值观的推理规则很难取得共识。对于命令性或道义性陈述，人们曾提出了适用于其推理的几种模态逻辑，但并没有得到普遍的接受，在哲学领域之外的接受度就更低了。

不过，为了改进有关推理，数理统计学家和经济学家在过去半个世纪里，在没有引入新的逻辑种类的情况下，提出了一种引人注目的正式理论。该理论的基本思想是把所有的价值观引人一个函数（即效用函数）之中。通过这种方式，它巧妙地解决了如何对不同的价值观进行比较的问题。事件的每一特定状态均被指定为某一效用水平，而这种假定实际上就隐含了价值观的比较。

这种正式理论被称为主观期望效用（Subjective Expected Utility, SEU）理论。它的提出是 20 世纪前半期最引人注目的智力成就之一。它是将推理运用于选择问题时的神器，我们下一步的任务就是对它做进一步考察，并对其有效性和局限性做出些许判断。

1 在笔者所著《发现模式》（Models of Discovery, Dordrecht 1977）第三节以及我（H. A. Simon）和西克罗西（L. Sikl6ssy）编辑的《表达与含意》（Representation and Meaning, Englewood Cliffs 1972）第八章「论关于行动的推理」（On Reasoning about Actions）中，我曾对违反模态逻辑的情形进行了考察。

1.3 主观期望效用模型

鉴于现有文献已对主观期望效用理论进行过不少严谨的分析和综合的考察 1，本节仅对其核心内容做简要的启发性评述。

1 如萨维奇（L. J. Savage）的经典之作《统计学基础》（The Foundations of Statistics, New York 1954）

基本理论

首先，该理论假设决策者拥有一个定义良好的效用函数（utility unction），他可以由此设定某基数型的数字，来度量他对事件在未来某特定状态下的喜爱程度。其次，该理论假设决策者面临着一组定义良好的替代性选择（set of alternatives）。这些替代性选择不一定是一次性的选择，而是可以包括一个选择或策略序列，且每一个子选择都是利用某特定时刻可以获得的信息做出的。第三，该理论假设决策者能够为未来的所有事件集合，指派一个连续的联合概率分布（joint probability distribution）。最后，该理论假设决策者所选择（或应该选择）的替代性选择或策略，将是按照其效用函数和相应的事件集合，能够最大化其期望效用的选择或策略。于是，每一种策略都与未来状态的某一概率分布相联系，而这种概率分布可用来对这些事件状态的效用进行加权。

主观期望效用模型（SEU model）共有四个主要组成部分，即基数效用函数、替代策略的完备集合、同每种策略相联系的未来事件状态的概率分布以及最大化期望效用的策略选择。

存在问题

主观期望效用模型在概念上美轮美奂，值得在柏拉图的理想国中占据一席之地，但在具体应用中则存在巨大的困难，使得我们很难按照字面意义将它应用于人类实际决策。我在其他地方曾详细讨论过这些困难（特别在《管理行为》一书中），在此仅简要赘述。

总体而言，主观期望效用模型假设决策者能够对他面临的世间万物无所不知。他知道他所面临的所有替代选择 —— 不仅了解当前的替代选择，而且熟知未来每一刻的替代选择。他对每一种可得选择或策略的后果的了解，至少能达到对世间万物的未来状态指定一个联合概率分布的程度。他能够协调或平衡相互冲突的所有价值观，并能够把它们整合成一个单个的效用函数；并且，在该效用函数中，他能够借助自己的偏好，对世间万物的所有未来状态进行排序。

主观期望效用模型对进入效用函数中的价值观的处理是非常机巧的：价值观就在效用函数之中，且价值观已把未来可能出现的所有替代性选择组织起来以表示连续性的偏好。主观期望效用模型的机巧，看似一种能够弄清楚世间万物当前与未来状态的机制；不过，该模型充其量只能告诉我们如何对既定的事实和价值观进行推理，但对它们从何而来则什么都没有说。

一旦弄清楚了这些假设，我们就可以明确地认识到：主观期望效用理论从来就没有被应用于真实世界，它也永远不能够被应用于真实世界（即便借助于超级计算机）。不过，我们却可以看到它在数理经济学、统计学和管理学中所谓的广泛应用，对比，不妨做进一步考察。我们发现，尽管这些应用仍然保留了主观期望效用理论的基本框架，但却对模型中不靠谱的决策问题进行了替换：或者是在效用函数和事件的联合概率分布已知的情形下，把它们简化为仅包括少量方程或变量的高度抽象的问题；或者是在复杂的现实世界中切出一个小心定义的、范围有限的微观问题。

主观期望效用是一种近似

我曾在管理学领域的一些研究中使用过主观期望效用理论，让我先向我自己家的窗户扔石头吧！霍尔特（Hot）、莫迪利安尼（Modigliani）、穆特（Muth）和我曾提出过一种不确定情形下的企业生产、存货和劳动的决策过程，该决策过程符合主观期望效用模型。1 效用函数是成本的负函数，其中成本包括生产成本、生产调整成本、订单损失成本和存货持有成本等。为了保证数学推导和计算过程易于处理，假设效用函数是解释变量的二次函数。另外，假设未来各期的预期销售额是已知的；对于二次效用函数，我们有同样的假设，从而使得是否具有完全的概率分布知识不再重要。最后，假设企业生产的是单一品种的同质产品，或者是可以由单维总量指标表示的一组产品。

1 C.C.Holt, F. Modigliani,J.R.Muth, and H. A. Simon, Planning Production, Inventories and Work Force (Englewood Cliffs, N. J., I960).

如果企业采用上述决策过程进行决策，那么它显然不同于真实世界中运用主观期望效用理论进行的决策。通过假设二次效用函数以及预期未来销售额是已知的，实际上已经预先规避了决策中的难题。不仅如此，这种单个生产决策是从管理者面临的一系列决策中单独抠出来的，并且为了使得该决策问题易于描述，我们假定它完全独立于其他决策或真实世界的其他方面。

我们提出的上述决策过程是一种有用的管理学工具，我并不急着为它的不足致歉。它能够且已经用于许多企业的实际决策之中，并取得了令人满意的效果。我在这里想强调的是，它只是对真实世界一小块且经过高度简化的运用，并且该决策过程所产生决策的好坏，更多地取决于近似性假设和支持性数据的充分性，而不是按照主观期望效用的决策规则来计算一个最大值。可以想象的是，通过采用完全不同于主观期望效用理论框架的决策过程，人们或许能够做出比通过我们的决策规则所产生的决策更好的决策（按照它对真实世界的影响来衡量）。

我们可以对主观期望效用框架下的经济模型做出同样的评价。在评价这类经济模型时，我们不能根据它们是否满足主观期望效用的基本假设来判断其真实性和有效性，而应重点关注其对效用和未来事件的假设是否足够接近真实世界的实际情形。

一旦我们接受这样的事实，即在任何实际应用中，主观期望效用规则只是对抽象概念的粗略近似，其结果也许能够、也许不能为真实世界中的问题提供令人满意的答案，那么，我们就可以自由地选择与主观期望效用无关的其他决策过程，它们同样可以提供令人满意的答案。如此，则下述问题就成了可以自由探讨的问题：人类在决策中遵循的实际决策过程是什么？它们同主观期望效用理论有什么样的关系？

至此，我希望我已令人信服地表明：在现实社会中，决策者不能简单地直接使用主观期望效用模型，而无论他们多么想用，都不可以。如果在这一点上仍然存疑，那么下述实验室的试验结果在某种程度上可以消除人们的疑虑。该试验要求受试者在类似于博弈试验情形下进行决策，其风险和不确定性水平略低于现实生活中的博弈。试验结果与阿莫斯·特沃斯基（Amos Tversky）及其同事在数篇学术论文中的发现非常相似：无论出于什么原因，也不论人们在试验中采取什么样的行为，毫无疑问的是，最终试验结果与主观期望效用理论存在广泛的差异。1 当然，我已经指出过存在这种差异的主要原因，此即：即使在相对简单的情形中，人类在事实依据、价值观的结构一致性、处理问题必备的推理能力等方面，都不足以直接应用主观期望效用模型。

1 参见特沃斯基和卡尼曼（A. Tversky&D. Kahnemann,1974) 及其引用的文献：A. Tversky D. Kahnemann, Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, Science 185:1124-1131 (1974).

下面，让我们考察一下人们实际上是如何决策的。

1.4 行为模型

在本小节中，我会先要求你稍微反省一下自己实际上是如何决策的，然后我会说出我的看法，你可以根据自己的反省，判断一下是否有道理。

首先，你的决策不是生活中广泛领域的问题的综合性选择，而是通常关注某些特定的具体事件。并且，尽管这些具体事件或许具有同等重要性，但你会假设它们相对独立于其他事项（暂不论这一假设是否合理）。例如，在购买一辆小汽车时，你可能不会同时考虑如何选择下周的晚餐菜单，也不会同时考虑如何对你的未来收入进行投资。

其次，当你进行某一具体决策时，无论它有多么重要，你都不可能对它在未来的具体详情了然于胸：未来的情况不仅包含概率分布，还取决于你决策时所做出的选择。对于你的生活方式和未来境况，你了解的不过是一个大致的概貌，也许不久会发生一两项重大改变，甚至会出现一些突发情况。你在考虑是否购买一辆汽车时，你只是对汽车的用途、你的收入水平、其他要求以及是否考虑在另一个城市找一份新工作等，有一个大致的概念。购买什么样的汽车受许多因素的影响，你不可能预见到每一种可能性。

再次，你正在考虑的是购买一辆汽车而不是一座房子，你也许会重点考虑生活或价值观的某几个方面而相对忽略其他方面。单单是购买汽车的沉思，也许就会激发起你的美好回忆或旅行梦想，并把你的注意力从居家欣赏音乐或朋友餐聚中转移开来。正因如此，仅仅一个综合性的效用函数，不太可能涵盖你的所有决策。相反，不同领域的决策会唤起不同的价值观，而关注点的变化则会使得选择出现很大的不一致性。我们都知道，如果我们想减肥，就应该远离诱人的美食。然而，假如我们的选择仅依赖于一个综合的、连续的效用函数，那么上述一切就不仅是没有必要的，而且也是没有什么用的了。

最后，你为购买汽车决策所付出的所有努力，大部分将耗费在了解现实情况、唤起相关价值观等方面。你也许会去阅读《消费者报告》（Consumer Reports）或向朋友们咨询，你也许会走访汽车经销商以了解各种车型，你也许还会对自己的喜好做进一步确认，等等。一旦此类事项准备就绪，且自己的偏好已被唤醒，那么现实中的实际选择也许只需花费一点点时间而已。

有限理性

上文提到的实际选择过程，在某种程度上只不过是「有限理性」的一个例子。我们有足够的理由做出这样的假设，即生物在进化过程中能够形成一种有限理性的能力。另有大量的心理学研究表明，人们往往会跟着感觉走，而这正是人类决策时（甚至在进行深思熟虑的决策时）所采用的决策模式。让我们把人类的这种选择模式称为「行为模型」（the behavioral model），以区别于基于主观期望效用理论的超凡模型（the Olympian model）。

按照有限理性的行为模型，人们在进行选择时没有必要在时间上无限追溯、在价值观上涵盖全部，也没有必要把选择中的每一个问题都与世间所有其他问题扯在一起。事实上，人类甚至所有生物所生活的环境，几乎都可以分解为相互独立的组成部分。有时你很饿，有时你很困，有时你很冷，但幸运的是，你通常不会同时碰到这三种情形。或者，即便你同时碰上了这三种情形，那么在最紧迫的需要得到解决之前，三者之中的其他两个至少可以稍事推延。你会有许多其他需要，但它们不会同时让你手忙脚乱。

我们生活的世界或许可以称为寂寥世界（a nearly empty world）：它有着数百万个变量，它们在理论上可以相互影响，但在现实生活的绝大多数情形中则不会。按照引力理论，世间万物相互牵引，但某些物体的引力却比其它物体为大，这或者是因为它们更大，或者是因为它们距离更近。也许现实世界存在着相互作用的密致网格，但我们必须承认，我们在绝大多数情况下只能考虑具有主导作用且数量有限的变量或因素。

即使这种可分解性并不足以描绘我们目前所生活的世界（下文将提出少许保留意见），但它肯定能够描绘人类理性在演进过程中所经历过的世界，如穴居人及其祖先所生活的世界。穴居人生活的世界，多数时间不会发生什么变化，但他们却不得不采取周期性的行动，以应对饥饿、逃离危险或准备过冬等。理性专注于一次处理一个或少数几个问题，但同时也会预期到会出现有待处理的新问题 1。

1 一个简单的正式模型，参见作者：Rational Choice and the Structure of the Environment, Psychological Review 63:129-138 (1956).

有限理性的机制

为了在有限制的现实社会中采取切合实际的行动，一个生物体需要具备什么样的特征呢？它需要通过某种方式来集中注意力（以避免分心或至少避免过于分心），并在特定时间里把注意力集中到需要高度关注的事情上。生理心理学家发现，所谓「情感」（emotions）的最重要功能，就是集中注意力。情感的作用是把你的注意力从当前的关注对象，转移到需要你马上关注的其他事情上。在现实社会中，我们大部分时间不需要外出寻找食物，但我们需要经常被提醒食物是必不可少的。因此，我们拥有定期唤起饥饿感的某种机制，来提醒我们对食物的需要。对于其他情感，可以做类似的解释。

生物体的某些需要，要求有连续性的行动。人类需要空气（只能在很短的时间里中断），血液必须在身体所有部位连续循环。当然，人类的生理机能可以同时照顾到各种长期需要和持续的短期需要。我们不需要为了呼吸或心脏跳动，而不得不把注意力集中到血液的含氧量上。但总体而言，对于并非始终伴随我们的那些断断续续的需要，我们就如动物一样，需要一次一件地依次处理。每次产生的这类需要，大致同我们大脑中一次能够处理的需要一样多。我们摆脱这种限制的能力以及只能依次处理但仍能够生存的能力，有赖于我们拥有能够保证新出现的紧急问题有着更高优先权的机制（特别是情感机制）。

其次，我们需要一种能够产生替代性选择的机制。我们在解决问题的过程中，很大的一部分精力是用于寻找更好的替代方案，或者对现有替代方案做进一步改进。过去 25 年来 1，认知心理学和人工智能领域的研究取得了很大的进展，增进了我们对如何产生替代性选择等问题的认识。在《人工科学》（The Sciences of the Articial) 2 一书的第三章和第四章中，我对其中的若干机制进行了描述。

1 译注：这个讲座的时间是 1982 年。

2 第二版（Cambridge 1981）。

再次，对于我们赖以生存的环境，我们需要具有获知其真实情况的能力，同时还需要具备根据有关真实情况做进一步推论的能力。这种能力有助于人们探寻替代方案并评估其可能的后果，并使得人们能够简化对那些与当前决策有关的环境的认识，进而进行常识性推理。

对于人类在思考和解决问题时运用的这种行为模型或有限理性，我们能够对它说些什么呢？又能够为它说些什么呢？我们能够说的第一点是，目前有大量的证据表明，该理论描述的正是人们进行决策和解决问题的实际方式。该理论是对现实生活中人类行为的描述，这已得到了越来越多的经验支持，具有坚实的经验基础。第二，该理论能够解释这样的事实：各种生物，不论它们是否聪明、能否思考，也许相对于周围异常复杂的整个世界仅仅拥有有限的计算能力，但它们仍然能够生存，甚至兴旺繁盛。它能够解释，在我们这个物种存活的同时，那些计算能力较低的物种何以能够至少存活了数百万年。在世间万物并非彼此紧密相连、各种问题都能够分解为相应组成部分的寂寥世界里，正是我刚刚描述过的这种理性，陪伴我们一路走过。

有限理性的后果

当然，行为模型描述的理性并不是最优的，它甚至不能保证我们的决策具有一致性。实际上，很容易表明，人类所做的选择通常取决于人们提出各种替代选择时的顺序。如果 A 的提出先于 B，那么 A 很可能就是可取的，或至少是令人满意的：但如果 B 的出现在前，那么 B 很可能就是可取的，甚至会在考虑 A 之前就选定了 B。

同超凡模型相比，行为模型舍弃了不少形式化的优雅，但这种舍弃却赢得了更多的回报，尤其是提供了看待理性的新方式。这种新方式能够解释，在如此复杂以至于基于主观期望效用理论的超凡模型难以解释的世界中，拥有我们这样心智能力（甚至硅谷所有计算机辅助下的心智能力）的生物如何过活。

1.5 直觉模型

与前文考察的两种理性模型相比，第三种人类理性模型更少被社会科学家提及，但它却在社会公众的脑海中占据更为重要的地位，不妨称之为「直觉模型」（the intuitive model）。直觉模型认为，大量的人类思维以及人们得以正确决策的原因，主要在于拥有良好的直觉或判断力。由于罗杰·斯佩里（Roger Sperry）和其他学者的研究，再加上人们对人类大脑左右半球分工的各种猜测性补充，直觉和判断力概念目前已经成为公共讨论中的热门词汇。

左脑与右脑

大脑半球的分工已成为某些人的浪漫幻觉。按照这种浪漫化的解释，大脑左侧善于分析，但迟缓平淡，缺乏想象力。左侧大脑的推理，既可以是前文第一种模型描述的超凡型推理，也可以是（如果恰好是可怜的人的左半球）第二种模型描述的行为型模式，一切视乎你的信念。但不论是哪一种方式，左脑都是一种脚踏实地、缺乏想象力的大脑半球它也许拥有深入分析的能力，但缺乏浮想联翩的翅膀。

接着说大脑右半球，它是人类储存想象力和创造力的地方，而想象力和创造力则是人类创造性地解决问题的源泉（假如人们能够把自己托付给这个脑半球）。

直觉和创造力并非总是相同的东西。在正面阐述它们的基本特征之前，有必要对刚刚讥讽过的浪漫主义观点稍做点评。我在寻找支持这种浪漫观点的经验证据时发现：从来就没有什么证据！当然，有很多证据表明大脑半球存在分工，但没有任何证据表明，任何一个大脑半球能够在正常情况下独立完成人类任何复杂的智力活动。总体而言，大部分证据表明，任何包含着获取信息、处理信息和利用信息的复杂思维活动，通常都会按照不同的比例和不同的方式，同时用到我们的两个大脑半球。

当然，问题的关键并不是大脑的功能定位。不管大脑两个半球中发生的到底是相同还是不同的事情，关键的问题是：人类思维是否具有分析性思维和直觉性思维两种完全不同的方式？我们所谓的创造力，是否主要取决于后者？

直觉与识别

什么是直觉？一种常见的现象是，有时候人们会忽然想到问题的答案，从而拥有一种强烈程度各异的「啊哈！」经验。毫无疑问，这是一种真实的现象。不仅如此，当人们拥有这样一种经验并据此做出直觉判断时，他们得到的答案往往是正确的。

在这一点上，国际象棋大师为我们提供了很好的数据。我们可以把一个布局合理的中盘棋局，拿给象棋大师或国手。他往往在看了短短五秒或十秒后，就能够走出下一步，并且这一步棋往往就是棋局中的最佳走法。与之不同，如果他是与一名强大的对手对阵，那么他就不会立即走出这一步：为了确定他的第一直觉是否正确，他可以坐等三分钟甚至半小时。不过，他的第一冲动实际上有 80-90% 的可能性走出了正确的一步棋。

对于国际象棋大师的出色直觉，心理学家已对此做出了很好的解释 1，它并不比解释你在上学路上短短数秒就认识一位朋友的能力深奥多少。除非你在走路时陷入沉思，否则这种相识就是可以即时发生的、真实可靠的。在我们已经拥有相当经验的任何一个领域中，我们都获得了许多「朋友」，即我们能够立即识别的刺激物。我们可以在大脑某网状排序系统中对这些刺激物进行排序（其生理学机制尚未可知），并把它从我们可能遇到的所有其他刺激物中识别出来。

1 笔者在《思想模式》（Models of Thought, New Haven, Conn,1979）的 6.2-6.5 章节中对有关证据进行了考察。

我们不仅可以通过看，而且可以通过听（母语词汇），来做到这一点。

几乎任何一个受过大学教育的人，都能够分辨五万到十万个单词，并记起它们的基本含义。多年来，我们用了数百小时查阅单词，并同五至十万个单词成了朋友。每一个专业的昆虫学家都能够辨别出他所见过的昆虫，每一个植物学家都能够分辨出他所看到的植物。在任何一个需要专业技能的领域，拥有一个能够识别出数万个目标物体或情景中任何一个的网状排序系统，是一个专业人士必须拥有的基本工具，也是其直觉的主要来源。

国际象棋大师拥有的「朋友」数量是可以计数的：棋盘上各个棋子的不同组合的数量，就是他们熟悉的老朋友的数量。据估计这些组合大约有五万个，在数量上大致与讲母语的人掌握的词汇量相当。直觉就是你认出一个朋友并根据你过去对他的了解而回忆起你们之间点点滴滴的能力。当然，你对朋友了解得越多，就越能够对他做出准确的判断。你应该把钱借给他吗？如果借了，你能要得回来吗？如果你非常了解你的朋友，那么你就可以凭直觉说「是」或「不」。

如何获得直觉和判断力

在关于创造力的文献中，常有关于「啊哈！」经验的记载。现在的问题是，我们为什么应该相信有关识别机制能够解释这种「啊哈！」经验？一个重要的原因是，大多数「啊哈！」现象，只能发生在拥有一定知识储备的人身上。正如巴斯德（Pasteur）所言，灵感只会闪现在有准备的大脑之中。现在，我们甚至已经拥有了能够揭示如下问题的数据：为了使得头脑能够达到世界一流创造力的水平，到底需要准备多长时间。

为了达到世界一流水平，为何某个领域需要与另一个领域准备同样长的时间，乍看起来似乎不太好理解。不过，考虑到对一个人创造力成效的评估，通常经由与其他人进行的比较，故一个人寿命的长短就是这种比较过程中的一个控制性参数。为了提高我们的熟练程度，我们通常需要花费一定的时间，但不会是无限长的时间。正因如此，为达到世界一流水平所需要准备的时间（指那些有一定天赋从而能够对此有所渴求的人），对于不同领域来说应该是大致相同的。

我的同事约翰·海斯（John R. Hayes）收到的国际象棋大师和作曲家的经验数据以及画家和数学家的不完整数据表明，十年是一个神奇的数字。在这些领域中，如果不能投入至少十年的密集学习和强化训练，几乎没有人能够达到世界一流水平。

神童又是一种什么情况呢？莫扎特（Mozart）在 17 岁的时候（肯定不会更早），就已经创作出了世界一流的乐曲（所谓世界一流乐曲，海斯采用的标准是一支乐曲在施万唱片目录中出现五次或以上。以此为标准，在莫扎特 17 岁以前，并不存在世界级的莫扎特；其少年时期的作品，后来人们之所以愿意去听，也只是因为它们出自莫扎特之手）。当然，莫扎特 4 岁的时候就已经开始作曲了，因此到 17 岁的时候，他已经自我训练了 13 年。海斯研究过莫扎特的传记，发现莫扎特确实是一个神童。简言之，出类拔萃的必要条件，是在一个领域勤奋地耕耘十年或以上。

小结：直觉模型与行为模型

人类思维的直觉模型和行为模型之间没有矛盾，它们也不是两个脑半球互相争夺大脑控制权的两种不同思维模式。所有严肃认真的思考，都需求两种模式的参与。它既包括一个类似于搜索的过程，又包括对熟悉之物的突然识别。如果没有基于先前经验的识别，那么在复杂空间中的搜索就会如蜗牛爬行般缓慢。直觉利用了我们在过去的搜索中获得的知识。可以预期的是，对于那些专家们借助直觉就可以解决的问题，新手往往需要经历一种痛苦的搜索过程；绝大多数的问题，既包括新奇的成分又包含熟悉的方面，其解决则有赖于直觉和搜索的合作。

1.6 直觉与情感

到目前为止，我们对直觉过程的讨论还没有涉及它的一个重要性质，即它通常与情感密切相关。搜索通常发生在解决问题的缓慢沉闷阶段，相对不容易陷入强烈的情感之中，可称之为「冷认知」；而突然间的发现或「啊哈！」经验，往往会唤起情感的共鸣，它是一种「热认知」。当人们对某事感到兴奋的时候，最容易产生新的想法。

情感与注意力

正因如此，为了获得关于人类理性的完整理论，我们必须理解情感究竟扮演何种角色。情感，很有可能有着几种完全不同的作用。首先，某些情感（如快乐）属于消费品，它在超凡模型中进入效用函数，但在行为模型中则理应列入我们所追求的目标之中。

但至少就本文的研究目的而言，情感具有特殊的重要性：情感的功能，是在我们所处的环境中选择出特定对象，作为我们关注的目标。为什么蕾切尔·卡森（Rachel Carson）的《寂静的春天》（Silent Spring）能够产生那么大的影响？她描述的问题，早在她描述之前就已为生态学家和生物学家所熟知，但她的描述采用的却是激发情感和引发注意力的方式。此类情感，一旦被激发出来就不会消失，且直至得到某种介入之前，人们不会转而关注其他问题。至少，情感会使得有关问题成为我们脑海中挥之不去的烦忧。

在超凡模型中，所有问题在得到解决之前都是永久性的和同时处理的。行为模型则与之不同，其核心是对问题进行选择，且情感在该选择过程中扮演着重要的角色。

情感并不总是会把我们的注意力引导到我们想要实现的目标上。以前述《我的奋斗》为例，我们可以看到书中的推理并不是冷推理，而是热推理。这是一种旨在唤起强烈情感的推理，且通常是唤起一种强烈的憎恨情感。《我的奋斗》之所以能够像《寂静的春天》或毕加索（Picasso）的《格尔尼卡》（Guernica）那样产生很大的影响，主要是因为它具有一种感召力，一种能够唤醒和强化德国读者脑海深处特定目标的能力。

理性的行为模型把集中注意力作为选择的主要决定因素，它并没有把情感从人类思维中抽离出来，也没有低估人类情感在解决问题过程中的重要性。

情感与教育：一种应用

为了探讨情感在教育中扮演的角色，我愿意做一番简短的考察。如果文学艺术作品具有激发情感的强大力量（它们确实有此力量），那么这是否意味着情感在教育过程中具有特殊的作用？

我们都知道，目前人文学科给人一种四面楚歌的感觉。在我们的大学中，大多数学生似乎更愿意入读法律、商科或医学专业，而人文学科则遭到了善意或其他原因的忽略。反对这种趋向的人通常认为，艺术家、人文学者而非科学家的观点，是大学生了解人类境况的更好、更有效的方式。当然，或因专业背景不同，笔者对此不敢苟同，但我同时也认为我们应该更审慎地看待这一问题。人们有效了解那些重要问题的最佳方式是什么？「冷认知」与「热认知」，哪种更好？或者暂不论哪一种更好，这是我们与科学或人文学科发生联系的一种方式吗？

在此，有一点我应该说明一下。我曾经听说有些物理学家在授课时，也会采取强行灌输「热认知」的方式。引起物理学家强烈兴趣去探索的那些深奥问题，通常是与基本粒子、天体物理和宇宙结构等有关的宇宙哲学问题。因此，也许我不应该严格地把科学与冷认知联系在一起。

不妨举一个能够更明确、更令人信服地表明这一点的例子。也许不少人比较熟悉阿瑟·库斯勒（Arthur Koestler）的《正午的黑暗》（Darkness at Noon）。这是一本小说，描述了 20 世纪 30 年代主人公在苏联大清洗时期所经历的事情。假如你想了解西方社会在两次世界大战之间的历史及其对当今世界的深远影响，那么你就一定需要了解一下大清洗。而对于大清洗的了解，你觉得下述哪一种方式最为有效？其一，阅读《正午的黑暗》；其二，阅读关于大清洗的历史书：其三，在图书馆寻找已公开的大清洗证词抄本。我认为阅读《正午的黑暗》是最佳方式，而这恰恰是因为它能够唤起大多数读者的强烈情感。

读《战争与和平》（War and Peace）还是军事社会学论著，读普鲁斯特（Proust）、契诃夫（Chekhov）还是人格读本，我可以一直这样列下去。假如我不得不为人文学科在教育中的作用以及诸如 20 世纪初期的传统文科课程等进行辩护的话，那么我会提出如下理由：如果信息是在一种情感激荡情形下呈现的，那么与完全不受情感影响的情形相比，大多数人专注于它们的时间会更长、思考的程度会更深，并能对它们留下更为深刻和持久的印象。

不过，借助于「热认知」的教育，同时也意味着一种责任：如果我们的社会科学知识是从小说家那里学到的，那么首先就要保证小说家对社会科学的理解是正确的、对社会科学的阐释是合理的。

目前大量文献都会提到弗洛伊德的理论，而这正是发生在新的心理学知识对弗洛伊德理论做出了重大修正之后。在当前的心理学领域，几乎看不到传统弗洛伊德理论的踪影。因此，如果我们采取情感语境下的人文学科教育方式，那么就会存在这样的风险：诸如传统弗洛伊德理论之类老掉牙的东西，会以强有力的方式对学生产生过大的影响。正因如此，我们必须重新评估人文经典，以明确它们被科学知识的进展所淘汰的程度。

荷马（Homer）仍然活着，这是因为《伊利亚特》（liad）和《奥德赛》（Odyssey）处理的是现代社会科学并没有取得什么进展或有更好理解的事情。亚里士多德（Aristotle）勉强还活着：其科学著述完全过时了，其逻辑学大多过时了；至于其认识论和形而上学是否仍值得讲给现在的学生听，我们与哲学家之间或许还需争论一番。当然，卢克莱修（Lucretius）的原子论则完全过时了。

由此，我们可以得到如下结论：各种著述能否唤起情感的能力本身，对于我们具有特殊的价值；如果我们希望把它们用于教育，那么就不仅需要重新评估其唤起情感的能力，而且需要重新评估它们在科学方面的有效性。

如果人文学科希望把它们关于人类境况的独特见解作为文科课程的基础，那么它们就必须能够表明其对于人类境况的阐释，具有生物学、社会学和心理学方面的合理性。就教育而言，人文作品仅仅靠打动学生是不够的，它们在打动学生时还应该教会学生们实事求是。当然，我的意思并不是说目前的人文学科不能满足这一标准，即便对当前任何一所大学的文科课程进行深入的评估也不可能得出是或否的简单结论。但我确实认为，对于不同领域的知识在文科课程中应扮演何种角色的任何考察，都必须高度重视它们在情感方面的强度、在经验方面的可靠性，二者缺一不可。

1.7 结论

第一讲探讨了关于理性的三种观点，它们同时也是看待理性选择的三种方式。

2『西蒙关于理性的三大观点，做一张主题卡片。（2022-04-23）』—— 已完成

第一种是超凡模型。它假定天地之间有一个进行综合性决策的英雄式人物。超凡模式也许是上帝的思考方式，但确实不宜视为人类的思维模式。就本文研究目的而言，我对它更多地持批评性态度。

第二种是行为模型。它假设人类理性是一种非常有限的理性，深受有关境遇和人类计算能力的限制。大量的经验证据表明，这是一种能够有效地描述人类如何决策的理论。它是阐释包括人类在内、拥有有限计算能力的生物体，如何在复杂而又寂寥的世界中，做出适应性选择并得以生存的一种理论。

第三种是直觉模型。它更为强调直觉的过程。我认为，直觉理论实际上是行为理论的一个组成部分，它强调的是一种识别过程：人类的技能是通过经验积累与识别而获得的，而这种识别过程则构成了其背后的基础。直觉理论认识到了人们的思想经常会受到情绪的影响，并解决了情感在将人们的注意力集中于特定问题时究竟扮演了什么角色的问题。

在下一讲中，我们将探讨第四种理论，即把理性视为适应性进化的观点。进化论是理性的现实模型。它意味着只有那些适应并表现为「犹如理性」的生物体，才能够生存下来。在接下来的一讲中，我将考察自然选择在人类理性实践中的作用和效力。




one kind of optimism, or supposed optimism, argues that ifwe think hard enough, are rational enough, we can solve all our problems. The eighteenth century, the Age of Reason, was supposed to have been imbued with this kind of optimisn 1. Whether it actually was or not I will leave to historians; certainly the h?pes v-ve hold out for reason in our world today are much more modest.

It is my purpose in these pages to explore from a contemporary standpoint the uses and limits of reason in human affairs. In order to avoid the kind of unwarranted optimism I have just mentioned, my first two chapters will be addressed n1ore to the limitations of reason than to its uses. I will try to redress the balance in my third chapter, but as I develop my topic I think you will see why I have taken up the limitations first. Only as we understand those limitations can we devise procedures to use effectively the powers that human reasoning capabilities do give us.

In the first chapter, I will focus initially on the very powerful formal models of rationality that have been constructed in this century and that must be counted among the jewels of intellectual accomplishment in our time. Since these models are well known, I will describe them only briefiy, devoting most of my discussion to showing Why, In apphcatlon to real human affairs thev deliver somewhat less than they appear to promise. But my intent here IS not mainly crtial. The last half of the chapter will de:elop. a more realistic descnption of human bounded ratton~ty, and will consider to what extent the limited cap.ablhty for analysis that is provided by bounded rationahty can meet the needs for reason in human affairs.

In the second chapter' I will discuss the thesis no~'adays often as~oci~ted with the discipline of sociobiology, that the deficiencies of reason will be corrected, for better or for wor~e, by the sterner rationality of natural selection. ~wo quesnons will be of particular concern in that discusSl.on :. first, ~rhether and to what degree altruism can surVIVe m a system subjected to the forces ofnatural selection and.' s~co~d, to what extent selection processes resembl~ optmuzatlon processes.

In the light of the conclusions reached in these two chapters, I will turn in the third to the question of how reason ~an be employed effectively in hwnan social affairs.

In SCienc.e one is. supposed to deliver new truths. The ~1ost crushing verdiCt that can be pronounced on a scientific ~ap:r is the fabled referee's report, scribbled in the margtn, ,;" hat's ne\v here is not true, and what's true is n~t n~w. ~ut the.se pages are not intended as reports of sct~ntific. discovenes and will not seek novelty. I will be sa?sfied If what I have to say is mainly true, even though it wtll not b~ at a~l new. As I shall argue in my discussion of hu~an rattonabty, attention needs to be called periodically to Important old truths.

At the same time, I do not wish simply to repeat here things that I have said at length in my previous books, and especially in Administrative Behavior and The Scienc~s ofthe Artificial, both of which are deeply concerned \vtth the concept of human rationality. In the former, I examined the implications of the limits of human rationality for organizational behavior. In the latter, I described prope~es that are common to all adaptive ("artificial") systems, g1Ving us a basis for constructing a general theory of such systems. In the present volume I have drawn on this pre-

vious work to the extent necessary to provide a framework for my discussion. But within this framework I have con-centrated on topics that remain problematic or controversial and that are of critical importance for understanding the role of rationality in human affairs. I have already indicated briefly what some of those problematic topics are.

### 1.1 The Limits of Reason

THE LIMITS OF REASON

Modern descendants of Archimedes are still looking for the fulcrum on which thev can rest the lever that is to move the whole world. In the domain of reasoning, the difficulty in finding a fulcrum resides in the truism " no conclusions without premises." Reasoning processes take symbolic inputs and deliver symbolic outputs. The. initial i~puts ~re axioms, themselves not derived by logtc but slffiply lnduced from empirical observations, ~r even more simply posited. Moreover, the processes that produce the transformations of inputs to outputs (rules of inference) are also introduced by fiat and are not the products of reason. Axioms and inference rules together constitute the fulcrum on which the lever of reasoning rests; but the particular structure of that fulcrum cannot be justified by the methods of reasoning. For an attempt at such a justification would involve us in an infinite regress of logics, each as arbitrary in its foundations as the preceding one.

This ineradicable element of arbitrariness-this Original Sin that corrupts the reasoning process, and therefore also its products-has two important consequences for our topic here. First, it puts forever beyond reach an unassailable principle of induction that would allow us to infer infallible general laws, without risk of error, from specific facts, even from myriads of them. No number of viewings of white swans can guarantee that a black one will not be seen next. Whether even a definite probability statement can be made about the color of the next swan is a matter of debate, with the negatives, I think, outnumbering the affirmatives.

Further, the foundations of these inductions-the facts-rest on a complex and sometimes unsteady base of observation, perception, and inference. Facts, especially in science, are usually gathered in with instruments that are themselves permeated with theoretical assumptions. No microscope \Vithout at least a primitive theory of light and optics; no human verbal protocols without a theory of short-term memory. Hence the fallibility of reasoning is guaranteed both by the impossibility of generating unassailable general propositions from particular facts, and by the tentative and theory-infected character of the facts themselves.

Second, the principle of " no conclusions without premises" puts forever beyond reach normative statements (statements containing an essential should) \vhose derivation is independent of inputs that also contain should's. None of the rules of inference that have gained acceptance are capable of generating normative outputs purely from descriptive inputs. 1 The corollary to " no conclusions vvithout premises" is " no ought's from is's alone." Thus, where~ as reason may provide povverful help in finding means to reach our ends, it has little to say about the ends themselves.

There is a final difficulty, first pointed out by Godel, that rich systems of logic are never complete-there always exist true theorems that cannot be reached as outputs by applying the legal transformations to the inputs. Since the problem of logical incompleteness is much less important in the application of reason to human affairs than the difficulties that concern us here, I shall not discuss it fur~ ther. Nor will I be concerned with whether the standard axioms oflogic and the rules ofinference themselves are to some extent arbitrary. For the purpose of this discussion, I shall regard them as unexceptionable.

Reason, then, goes to work only after it has been supplied with a suitable set of inputs, or premises. If reason is to be applied to discovering and choosing courses of action, then those inputs include, at the least, a set of should's, or values to be achieved, and a set of is's, or facts

about the world in which the action is to be taken. Any attempt to justify these should's and is's by logic will simply lead to a regress to new should's and is's that are similarly postulated.

VALUES

We see that reason is wholly instrumental. It cannot tell us where to go; at best it can tell us how to get there. It is a

I will not undertake to make the argument here. It was stated well many years ago by Ayer, in Language, Truth, and Logic, re\'. ed. (New York, 1946), chap. 6.

gun for hire that can be employed in the service of whatever goals \Ve have, good or bad. It makes a great difference in our view of the human condition \vhether . we attribute our difficulties to evil or to ignorance and irrationality- to the baseness of goals or to our not knowing how to reach them.

Method in Madness

A useful, if outrageous, exercise for sharpening one's thinking about the limited usefulness of reasoning, taken in isolation, is to attempt to read Hitler's M ein ](ampf analytically-as though preparing for a debate. The exercise is likely to be painful, but is revealing about how facts, values, and emotions interact in our thinking about human affairs. I pick this particular example because the reader's critical faculties are unlikely, in this case, to be dulled by agreement with the views expressed.

Most of us would take exception to many of Hitler's "facts," especially his analysis of the causes of Europe's economic difficulties, and most of all his allegations that Jews and Marxists (whom he also mistakenly found indistinguishable) were at the root of them. H owever, if we were to suspend disbelief for a moment and accept his "facts'' as true, much of the Nazi program would be·quite consistent with goals of security for the German nation or even of welfare for the German people. Up to this point, the unacceptability of that program to us is not a matter of evil goals-no one would object to concern for the welfare of the German people-or of faulty reasoning from those goals, but rests on the unacceptability of the factual postulates that connect the goals to the program. From this viewpoint, we might decide that the remedy for Nazism was to combat its program by reason resting on better facmal premises.

But somehow that calm response does not seem to match the outrage thatMeinJ(ampfproduces in us. There must be something more to our rejection of its argument, and obviously there is. Its stated goals are, to put it mildly, incomplete. Statements of human goals usually clist~­

guish between a " we" for whom the goals are shaped and a " they" whose welfare is not " our" primary concern. Hitler's ''we" \vas the German people-the definition of " we" being again based on some dubious "facts" about a genetic difference between Aryan an~ non-~ryan peoples. Leaving aside this fantasy of Nord1c pur~ty, most ~f u~ would still define " we" differently from H 1tler. Our 'we might be Americans instead of Germans, or, if \Ve had reached a twenty-first-century state of enlightenment, our " we" might even be the human species. In e~ther .case, w_e would be involved in a genuine value conflict w1th Metn J(ampf, a conflict not resolvable in any obvious way by improvements in either facts or reasoning. Our posmlation of a ''we" -of the boundary of our concern for others-is a basic assumption about what is good and what is evil.

Probably the greatest sense of outrage that M ein J(~mpf generates stems from the sharpness of the boundary Hnler draws between " we" and " they." Not only does he give priority to "we," but he argues that .an! treatment of " they," however violent, is justifiable If 1t advances the goals of "we." Even if Hitler's gen~ral g?als and "facts" were accepted, most of us would st11l obJect to the measures he proposes to inflict on " they" in order to nurture the welfare of ''we." If, in our system of values, we do not regard " they'' as being without rights, reason will disclose to us a conflict of values a conflict between our value of helping " we" and our general goal of not inflicting harm on "they." And so it is not its reasoning for which \Ve must fault Mein l(ampf, but its alleged facts and its outrageous values. .

There is another lesson to be learned from Mein !(ampf. We cannot read many lines of it before detecting that Hitler's reasoning is not cold reasoning but hot reasoning. w~ have long since learned that when a position is declaimed with passion and invective, there is special need to examine carefully both its premises and its inferences. We have l~ar_ned th~s, but we do not always practice it. Regrettably, 1t ts prectsely when the passion and invective reso~ate with our own inner feelings that we forget the warntog and become uncritical readers or listeners .

. Hitler was an effective rhetorician for Germans pre-

ctsely because his passion and invectives resonated with beliefs and values already present in many German hearts. The ~eat of his rhetoric rendered his readers incapable of applymg the rules of reason and evidence to his arguments. Nor was it only Germans who resonated to the facts and values he proclaimed. The latent anti-Semitism and overt anti-Communism of many Western statesmen made a number of his arguments plausible to them.

And so we learned, by bitter experience and against our first quick judgments, that we could not dismiss Hitler as a madman, for there was method in his madness. His prose met standards of reason neither higher nor lower than we are accustomed to encountering in writing designed to persuade. Reason was not, could not have been, our principal shield against Nazism. Our principal shield was contrary factual beliefs and values.

De Gustibus Est Disputandum

Recognizing all these complications in the use of rea. son, hot or cold, and recognizing also that ought's cannot be derived from is's alone, we must still admit that it is possible to reason about conduct. For most of the ought's we profess are not ultimate standards of conduct but only subgoals, adopted as means to other goals. For example, taken in isolation a goal like "live within your income" may sound unassailable. Yet a student might be well advised to go into debt in order to complete his or her education. A debt incurred as an investment in future productivity is different from a gambling debt.

Values can indeed be disputed (r) if satisfying them has consequences, present or future, for other values, (2) if they are acquired values, or (3) if they are instrumental to more final values. But although there has been widespread consensus about the rules of reasoning that apply to factual matters, it has proved far more difficult over the centuries to reach agreement about the rules that should govern reasoning about interrelated values. Several varieties of modal logic proposed for reasoning about imperative and deontic statements have gained little acceptance and even less application outside of philosophy.2 

2 1 state the case against modal logics in Section 3 of my Models ofDiscomy (Dordrecht, 1977) and in "On Reasoning about Actions," chap. 8 of H. A. Simon and L. Sik16ssy, eds., Representation and Meaning (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1972).

In the past half century, however, an impressive body of formal theory has been erected by mathematical statisticians and economists to help us reason about these matters- without introducing a new kind of logic. The basic idea of this theory is to load all values into a single function, the utility function, in this way finessing the question of how different values are to be compared. The comparison has in effect already been made when it is assumed that a utility has been assigned to each particular state of affairs.

This formal theory is called subjective expected utility (SEU) theory. Its construction is one of the impressive intellectual achievements of the first half of the twentieth century. It is an elegant machine for applying reason to problems of choice. Our next task is to examine it, and to make some judgments about its validity and limitations.

SUBJECTIVE

EXPECTED UTILITY

Since a number of comprehensive and rigorous accounts of SEU theory are available in the literature, 3 I \Vill give here only a brief heuristic survey of its main components.

The Theory First, the theory assumes that a decision maker has a well-defined utility function, and hence that he can assign a cardinal number as a measure ofhis liking of any particular scenario of events over the future. Second, it assumes that the decision maker is confronted with a well-defined set of alternatives to choose from. These alternatives need not be one-time choices, but may involve sequences of choices or strategies in which each subchoice will be made only at a specified time using the information available at that time.

3 For example, L. J. SaYage's classic, The Fou11datio11S ofStatistics (Ne,,· York, 1954).

Third, it assumes that the decision maker can assign a consistent Joint probability distribution to all furore sets of events. Finally, it assumes that the decision maker will (or should) choose the alternative, or the strategy, that will maximize the expected value, in terms of his utility function, of the set of events consequent on the strategy. With each strategy, then, is associated a probability distribution of future scenarios that can be used to weight the utilities of those scenarios.

These are the four principal components of the SEU model: a cardinal utility function, an exhaustive set of alternative strategies, a probability distribution of scenarios for the future associated with each strategy, and a policy of maximizing expected utility.

Problems with the Theory Con~epmally, the SEU model is a beautiful object deserving a prominent place in Plato's heaven of ideas. But vast difficulties make it impossible to employ it in any literal way in making actual human decisions. I have said so much about these difficulties at other times and places (particularly in the pages ofAdministrative Behavior) that I will make only the briefest mention of them here.

The SEU model assumes that the decision maker contemplates, in one comprehensive view, everything t~at lies before him. He understands the range of alternative choices open to him, not only at the moment but over the whole panorama of the future. He understands the consequences of each of the available choice strategies, at least up to the point of being able to assign a joint probability distribution to future states of the world. He has reconciled or balanced all his conflicting partial values and synthesized them into a single utility function that orders, by his preference for them, all these future states of the ·world.

The SEU model finesses completely the origins of the values that enter into the utility function; they are simply there, already organized to express consistent preferences among all alternative futures that may be presented for choice. The SEU model finesses just as completely the processes for ascertaining the facts of the present and future states of the world. At best, the model tells us how to reason about fact and value premises; it says nothing about where they come from.

When these assumptions are stated explicitly, it becomes obvious that SEU theory has never been applied, and never can be applied-with or without the largest computers-in the real world. Yet one encounters many purported applications in mathematical economics, statistics, and management science. Examined more closely, these applications retain the formal structure of SEU theory, but substitute for the incredible decision problem postulated in that theory either a highly abstracted problem in a world simplified to a few equations and variables, with the utility function and the joint probability distributions of events assumed to be already provided, or a microproblem referring to some tiny, carefully defined and bounded situation carved out of a larger real-world reality.

SE U as an Approximation

Since I have had occasion to use SEU theory in some of my own research in management science, let me throw the stone through my own window. Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and I constructed a procedure for making decisions about production levels, inventories, and work force in a factory under conditions of uncertainty. 4 The procedure fits the SEU model. The utility function is (the negative of) a cost function, comprising costs of production, costs of changing the level of production, putative costs of lost orders, and inventory holding costs. The utility function is assumed to be quadratic in the independent variables, an assumption made because it is absolutely essential if the mathematics and computation are to be manageable. Expected values for sales in each future period are assumed to be known. (The same assumption of the quadratic utility function fortunately makes knowledge of the complete probability distributions irrelevant.) The factory is assumed to have a single homogeneous product, or a set of products that can legitimately be represented by a singledimensional aggregate.

It is clear that if this decision procedure is used to make decisions for a factory, that is very different from employing SEU theory to make decisions in the real world. All but one of the hard questions have been ans\vered in advance by the assumption of a known, quadratic criterion function and known expected values of future sales. Moreover, this single set of production decisions has been carved out of the entire array of decisions that management has to make, and it has been assumed to be describable in a fashion that is completely independent of information about those other decisions or about any other aspect of the real world.

I have no urge to apologize for our decision procedure

C. C. Holt, F. Modigliani, J. R. M uth, and H. A. Simon, Planning Production, Inventories and Work Force (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., I96o). ,

as a useful management science tool. It can be, and has been, applied to this practical decision task in a number of factory situations and seems to have operated satisfactorily. What I wish to emphasize is that it is applied to a

highly simplified representation of a tiny fragment of the real-world situation, and that the goodness of the decisions it will produce depends much more on the adequacy of the approximating assumptions and the data supporting them than it does on the computation of a maximizing value according to the prescribed SEU decision rule. Hence, it would be perfectly conceivable for someone to contrive a quite different decision procedure, outside the framework of SE U theory, that would produce better decisions in these situations (measured by real-world consequences) than would be produced by our decision rule.

Exactly the same comments can be made about economic models formed within the SEU mold. Their veridicality and usefulness cannot be judged from the fact that they satisfy, formally, the SED assumptions. In evaluating them, it is critical to know how close the postulated utilities and future events match those of the real world.

Once we accept the fact that, in any actual application, the SED rule supplies only a crude approximation to an abstraction, an outcome that may or may not provide satisfactory solutions to the real-world problems, then we are free to ask what other decision procedures, W1related to SEU, might also provide satisfactory outcomes. In particular, we are free to ask what procedures human beings actually use in their decision making and what relation those actual procedures bear to the SEU theory.

I hope I have persuaded you that, in typical real-world situations, decision makers, no matter how badly they want to do so, simply cannot apply the SEU model. If doubt still remains on this point, it can be dissipated by examining the results of laboratory experiments in which human subjects have been asked to make decisions involving risk and uncertainty in game-like situations orders of magnitude simpler than the game of real life. The evidence, much of which has been assembled in several articles by Amos Tversky and his colleagues, leaves no doubt whatever that the human behavior in these choice situa~ tions-for whatever reasons-departs widely from the prescriptions of SEU theory. 5 Of course, I have already suggested what the principal reason is for this departure. It is that human beings have neither the facts nor the consistent structure of values nor the reasoning power at their disposal that would be required, even in these relatively siinple situations, to apply SEU principles. As our next task, we consider what they do instead.

THE BEHAVIORAL ALTERNATIVE

5 See A. Tversky and D. Kahnemann, " Judgment under Uncertainty: H euristics and Biases,'' Science 185: II24- 3I (1974-), and references ci~ed there.

I will ask you to introspect a bit about how you actually make decisions, and I will make some assertions that you· can check against your introspections. First, your decisions are not comprehensive choices over large areas of your life, but are generally concerned with rather specific matters, assumed, whether correctly or not, to be relatively independent of other, perhaps equally important, dimensions of life. At the moment you are buying a car, you are probably not also simultaneously choosing next week's dinner menu, or even deciding how to invest income you plan to save.

. Second, when you make any particular decision, even an Important one, you probably do not work out detailed sce~arios of the future, complete with probability distributions, conditional on the alternative vou choose. You have a general picture of your life-style a~d prospects, and perhaps of one or two major contemplated changes in the near future, and even of a couple of contingencies. When y~u are considering buying a car, you have a general notion of your use of automobiles, your income and the oth~r demands on it, and whether you are thinking of ge~~g a new job in another city. You are unlikely to env1s1on large numbers of other possibilities that might affect what kind of car it makes sense to buy.

Third, the very fact that you are thinking about buying a car, and not a house, will probably focus your attention on some aspects of your life and some of your values to the ~·elative neglect ? f others. The mere contemplation ofbuymg a car may stimulate fond memories or dreams of travel and divert y~ur a~ention fr~m the pleasures oflistening t~ stereo or gtvtng dinner parties for friends at home. Hence it _is unlikely that a single comprehensive utility functio~ Will watch over the whole range ofdecisions you make. On ~e contrary, particular decision domains will evoke particular values, and great inconsistencies in choice may result from fluctuating attention. We all know that if we ~ant to diet, we should resist exposing ourselves to temptIng food. That would be neither necessary nor useful if our choices were actually guided by a single comprehensive and consistent utility function.

Fourth, a large part of whatever effort vou devote to making your car-buying decision ·will be absorbed in gathering facts and evoking possibly relevant values. You may read Consumer Reports and consult friends; you may visit car dealers in order to learn more about the various alternatives, and to learn more about your own tastes as ·well. Once facts of this sort have been assembled, and preferences evoked, the actual choice may take very little time.

Bounded Rationality

Choices made in the general way I have just been describing are sometimes characterized as instances of bounded rationality. Good reasons can be given for supposing that evolutionary processes might produce creatures capable of bounded rationality. Moreover, a great deal of psychological research supports the hunch to which our introspections have led us, namely that this is the way in which human decisions-even the most deliberate-are made. Let us call this model of human choice the behavioral model, to contrast it with the Olympian model of SEU theory.

Within the behavioral model of bounded rationality, one doesn't have to make choices that are infinitely deep in time, that encompass the whole range of human values, and in which each problem is interconnected with all the other problems in the world. In actual fact, the environ~ ment in which we live, in which all creatures live, is an environment that is nearly factorable into separate problems. Sometimes you're hungry, sometimes you're sleepy, sometimes you're cold. Fortunately, you're not often all three at the same time. Or if you are, all but one of these needs can be postponed until the most pressing is taken care of. You have lots of other needs, too, but these also do not all impinge on you at once.

We live in what might be called a nearly empty \vorldone in which there are millions of variables that in principle could affect each other but that most of the time don't. In gravitational theory everything is pulling at everything else, but some things pull harder than others, either because they're bigger or because they're closer. Perhaps there is actually a very dense network of interconnections in the world, but in most of the situations we face we can detect only a modest number of variables or considerations that dominate.

Ifthis factorability is not wholly descriptive ofthe world we live in today and I will express some reservations about that it certainly describes the world in which human rationality evolved: the world of the cavemen's ancestors, and of the cavemen themselves. In that world, very little was happening most of the time, but periodically action had to be taken to deal with hunger, or to flee danger, or to secure protection against the coming winter. Rationality could focus on dealing with one or a fe\v problems at a time, with the expectation that when other problems arose there would be time to deal with those too.6 

Mechanisms for Bounded Rationality

What characteristics does an organism need to enable it to exercise a sensible kind of bounded reality? It needs

6 A simple formal model of such rationality is provided by my "Rational Choice and the Structure of the Environment,'' Psychological Review 63: 129-38 (I9S6).

some way of focusing attention of avoiding distraction (or at least too much distraction) and focusing on the things that need attention at a given time. A very strong case can be made, and has been made by physiological psychologists, that focusing attention is one of the principal functions of the processes we call emotions. One thing an emotion can do for and to you is to distract you from your current focus of thought, and to call your attention to something else that presumably needs attention right no\v. Most of the time in our society we don't have to be out looking for food, but every so often we need to be reminded that food is necessary. So we possess some mechanisms that arouse periodically the feeling of hunger, to direct our attention to the need for food. A similar account can be given of other emotions. Some of an organism's requirements call for continuous activity. People need to have air access to it can be interrupted only for a short time and their blood must circulate continually to all parts of their bodies. Of course, human physiology takes care of these and other short-term insistent needs in parallel with the long-term needs. We do not have to have our attention directed to a lack of oxygen in our bloodstream in order to take a breath, or for our heart to beat. But by and large, with respect to those needs that are intermittent, that aren't constantly with us, we operate very much as serial, one-at-a-time, animals. One such need is about as many as our minds can handle at one time. Our ability to get a\vay with that limitation, and to survive in spite of our seriality, depends on the mechanisms, particularly emotional mechanisms, that assure new problems of high urgency a high priority on the agenda.

Second, \Ve need a mechanism capable of generating alternatives. A large part of our problem solving consists in the search for good alternatives, or for improvements in alternatives that we already know. In the past 25 years, research in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence has taught us a lot about how alternatives are generated. I have given a description of some of the mechanisms in Chapters 3 and 4 of The Sciences of the Artificial.7 

Third, we need a capability for acquiring facts about the environment in which we find ourselves, and a modest capability for drawing inferences from these facts. Of course, this capability is used to help generate alternatives as well as to assess their probable consequences, enabling the organism to maintain a very simple model of the part of the world that is relevant to its current decisions, and to do commonsense reasoning about the model.

7 Second ed. (Cambridge, Mass., 1981).

What can vve say for and about this behavioral version, this bounded rationality version, of human thinking and problem solving? The first thing we can say is that there is now a tremendous weight of evidence that this theory describes the way people, in fact 1 make decisions and solve problems. The theory has an increasingly firm empirical base as a description of human behavior. Second, it is a theory that accounts for the fact that creatures stay alive • and even thrive, who-however smart they are or think they are have modest computational abilities in comparison with the complexity of the entire world that surrounds them. It explains how such creatures have survived for at least the millions of years that our species has survived. In a world that is nearly empty, in which not every thing is closely connected with everything else, in whi~ problems can be decomposed into their component~---:- In such a world, the kind of rationality I've been descnb1ng gets us by.

Consequences ofBounded Rationality

.

Rationality of the sort described by the behavioral model doesn't optimize, of course. Nor does it even guarantee that our decisions will be consistent. As a matter of fact, it is very easy to show that choices made by an organism having these characteristics will often depend on the order in which alternatives are presented. If A is presented before B, A may seem desirable or at least satisfactory~ but ifB is presented before A, B will seem desirable and w1ll be chosen before A is even considered.

The behavioral model gives up many of the beautiful formal properties of the Olympian model, b~t in re~rn for giving them up it provides a way of looking at ratl~nality that explains how creatures with our mental capacities or even, with our mental capacities supplemented with all the computers in Silicon Valley-get along in a world that is much too complicated to be understood from the Olympian viewpoint of SEU theory.

INTUI T IVE

RATIONALITY

A third model of human rationality has been much less discussed bv social scientists than the two that I've considered so far: but is perhaps even more prominent in the popular imagination. I've referred to it as the intuitive model. The intuitive model postulates that a great deal of human thinking, and a great deal of the success of human beings in arriving at correct decisions, is due to the fact that they have good intuition or good judgment. The notions of intuition and judgment are particularly prominent in public discussion today because of the research of Roger Sperry and others, much supplemented by speculation, on the specialization of the left and right hemispheres of the human brain.

The Two Sides of the Brain

In the minds and hands of some writers, the notion of hemisphere specialization has been turned into a kind of romance. According to this romanticized account, there's the dull, pedestrian left side of the brain, which is very analytic. It either, depending on your beliefs, does the

Olympian kind of reasoning that I described first, or- if it's just a poor man's left hemisphere-does the behavioral kind of thinking I described as the second model. In either case, it's a down-to-earth, pedestrian sort of hemisphere, capable perhaps of deep analysis but not of flights of fancy. Then there's the right hemisphere, in which is stored human imagination, creativity all those good things that account for the abilities of human beings, if they would entrust themselves to this hemisphere, to solve problems 1n a creanve way.

Before I try to characterize intuition and creativity (they are not always the same thing) in a positive way, I must comment on the romantic view I have just caricatured. When we look for the empirical evidence for it, we find that there is none. There is lots of evidence, of course, for specialization of the hemispheres, but none of that evidence really argues that any complex human mental function is performed by either ofthe hemispheres alone under normal circumstances. By and large, the evidence shows that any kind of complex thinking that involves taking in information, processing that information, and doing something \vith it employs both of our hemispheres in varying proportions and in various \Vavs.

•

Of course, brain localization is not the important issue at stake. Regardless of whether the same things or different things go on in the two hemispheres, the impor· tant question is whether there are two radically different forms of human thought-analytic thought and intuitive thought-and whether \Vhat we call creativitv relies ' largely on the latter.

Intuition and Recognition

What is intuition all about? It is an observable fact that people sometimes reach solutions to problems suddenly. They then have an " aha!" experience of varying degrees of intensity. There is no doubt of the genuineness of the phenomenon. Moreover, the problem solutions people reach \vhen they have these experiences, \vhen they make intuitive judgments, frequently are correct.

Good data are available on this point for chess masters. Show a chess position, from a mid-game situation in a reasonable game, to a master or grand master. After looking at it for only five or ten seconds, he will usually be able to propose a strong move-very often the move that is objectively best in the position. If he's playing the game against a strong opponent, he won't make that move immediately; he may sit for three minutes or half an hour in order to decide whether or not his first intuition is really correct. But perhaps 8o or 90 percent of the time, his first impulse will in fact show him the correct move.

The explanation for the chess master's sound intuitions is well known to psychologists, and is not really surprising. 8 It is no deeper than the explanation of your ability, in a matter of seconds, to recognize one of your friends whom you meet on the path tomorrow as you are going to class. Unless you are very deep in thought. as you walk, the recognition will be immediate and reliable. Now in any field in which we have gained considerable experience, \Ve have acquired a large number of " friends"-a large number of stimuli that we can recognize immediately. We can sort the stimulus in whatever sorting net performs this function in the brain (the physiology of it is not understood), and discriminate it from all the other stimuli we might encounter. We can do this not only with faces, but with words in our native language.

Almost every college-educated person can discriminate among, and recall the meanings of, fifty to a hundred thousand different words. Someho\v, over the years, we have all spent many hundreds of hours looking at words, and we have made friends \vith fiftv or a hundred thousand ' of them. Every professional entomologist has a comparable ability to discriminate among the insects he sees, and every botanist among the plants. In any field of expertise, possession of an elaborate discrimination net that permits recognition of any one of tens of thousands of different objects or situations is one of the basic tools of the expert and the principal source of his intuitions.

For a survey of the evidence, see my Models of'Thought (New H aven, Conn., 1979), chaps. 6.2-6.5.

Counts have been made of the numbers of " friends" that chess masters have: the numbers of different configurations of pieces on a chessboard that are old familiar acquaintances to them. The estimates come out, as an order of magnitude, around fifty thousand, roughly comparable to vocabulary estimates for native speakers. Intuition is the ability to recognize a friend and to retrieve from memory all the things you've learned about the friend in the years that you've known him. And of course if you know a lot about the friend, you'll be able to make good judgments about him. Should you lend him money or not? Will you get it back if you do? Ifyou know the friend well, you can say " yes" or " no" intuitively.

Acquiring Intuitions and Judgment

Why should we believe that the recognition mechanism explains most of the " aha!" experiences that have been reported in the literature of creativity? An important reason is that valid "aha!~~ experiences happen only to people who possess the appropriate knowledge. Poincare rightly said that inspiration comes only to the prepared mind. Today we even have some data that indicate how long it takes to prepare a mind for world-class creative performance.

At first blush, it is not clear why it should take just as long in one field as in another to reach a world-class level of performance. However, human quality of performance is evaluated by comparing it with the performance of other human beings. Hence the length of human life is a controlling parameter in the competition; we can spend a substantial fraction of our lives, but no more, in increasing our proficiency. For this reason, the time required to prepare for world-class performance (by the people whose talents allow them to aspire to that level) should be roughly the same for different fields of activity.

Empirical data gathered by my colleague John R. Hayes for chess masters and composers, and somewhat less systematically for painters and mathematicians, indicate that ten years is the magic number. Almost no person in these disciplines has produced world-class performances ·without having first put in at least ten years of intensive learning and practice.

What about child prodigies? Mozart was composing world-class music perhaps by the time he \Vas seventeencertainly no earlier. (The standard Hayes used for music is five or more appearances of recordings of a piece of music in the Schwann catalog. Except for some Mozart juvenilia, which no one would bother to listen to if thev hadn't been " written by Mozart, there is no world-class Mozart before • the age of seventeen.) Of course Mozart was already composing at the age of four, so that by age seventeen he had already been educating himself for thirteen years. Mozart is typical of the child prodigies whose biographies Hayes has examined. A sine qua non for outstanding \Vork is diligent attention to the field over a decade or more.

Summary: The Intuitive and Behavioral Models There is no contradiction bet\veen the intuitive model of thinking and the behavioral model, nor do the two models represent alternative modes of thought residing in different cerebral hemispheres and competing for control over the mind. All serious thinking calls on both modes,

both search-like processes and the sudden recognition of familiar patterns. Without recognition based on previous experience, search through complex spaces would proceed in snail-like fashion. Intuition exploits the knowledge we have gained through our past searches. Hence we would expect what in fact occurs, that the expert will often be able to proceed intuitively in attacking a problem that requires painful search for the novice. And we would expect also that in most problem situations combining aspects of novelty with familiar components, inruition and search will cooperate in reaching solutions.

INTUITION AND

EM OT ION

Thus far in our discussion of intuitive processes we have left aside one of the important characteristics these processes are said to possess: their frequent association with emotion. The searching, plodding stages of problem solving tend to be relatively free from intense emotion; they may be described as cold cognition. But sudden discovery, the "aha!" experience, tends to evoke emotion; it is hot cognition. Sometimes ideas come to people when they are excited about something.

Emotion and Attention Hence, in order to have anything like a complete theory of human rationalitv, we have to understand what role emotion plays in it. Most likely it serves several quite distinct functions. First of all, some kinds of emotion (e.g., pleasure) are consumption goods. They enter into the utility function of the Olympian theory, and must be counted among the goals we strive for in the behavioral model of rationality.

But for our purposes, en1otion has particular importance because of its function of selecting particular things in our environments as the focus of our attention. Why was Rachel Carson's Silent Spring so influential? The problems she described were already known t~ ecologists and the other biologists at the time she descnbed them. But she described them in a \Vay that aroused emotion, that riveted our attention on the problem she raised. That emotion, once aroused, wouldn't let us go off and worry about other problems until something had been done about this one. At the very least, emotion kept the problem in the back of our minds as a nagging issue that wouldn't go away.

In the Olympian model, all problems are permanently and simultaneously on the agenda (until they are solved). In the behavioral model, by contrast, the choice of problems for the agenda is a matter of central importance, and emotion may play a large role in that choice.

Emotion does not always direct our attention to goals we regard as desirable. If I may go back to my example of Meinl(ampf, we observed that the reasoning in that book is not cold reasoning but hot reasoning. It is reasoning that seeks deliberately to arouse strong emotions, often the emotion of hate, a powerful human emotion. And of course, the influence of Mein J(ampf, like that of Silent Spring or Picasso's Guernica, was due in lar~~ part to the fact that it did have evocative power, the abthty to arouse and fix the attention of its German readers on the particular goals it had in mind.

A behavioral theory of rationality, with its concern for the focus of attention as a major determinant of choice, does not dissociate emotion from human thought, nor does it in any respect underestimate the powerful effec~s of emotion in setting the agenda for human problem solvtng.

Emotion in Education

I would like to take a brief excursion at this point in order to consider the role of emotion in education. If literarv and artistic \vorks have a considerable power to evoke emotions as thev certainly do, does this power sug' . gest any special role for them in the educational process?

We all know that the humanities feel a bit besieged today. A large proportion of the students. in our unive~sities appear to want to enroll in law, business, or medicine, and the humanities suffer neglect, benign or otherwise. One argument that is often advanced by those who would counter this trend is that it may be better, more effective, for students to learn about the human condition bv exposure to the artist's and humanist's view of the ~orld than by exposure to the scientist's. Of course ~y own professional identifications put me on the other. s1de of the argument, but I think we should look at the tssue quite carefully. What are the optimum co~ditions for efficient human learning about central and Important matters? Which is better, cold cognition or hot? And \vhichever is better, will \Ve find that this is the kind we associate with the sciences or the humanities?

I should say here that I have heard physicists argue for a strong infusion of hot cognition in teach_ing their subject. The problems that excite them, and motivate them to understand rather abstruse matters,. are the cosmological and philosophical problems associated with th~ fundamental particles, and with astrophysics and the archit~cture ~f the universe. So perhaps I should not have associated sc1ence strictly with cold cognition.

But let me go to a domain \Vhere the point can be made more unequivocally and convincingly. Perhaps some of you are familiar with Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon. It is a novel that describes what happens to a particular person at the time of the Russian purge trials of the 1930's. Now suppose you wish to understand the history of the Western world between the two world wars, and the events that led up to our contemporary world. You will then certainly need to understand the purge trials. Are you more likely to gain such an understanding by reading Darkness at Noon, or by reading a history book that deals with the trials, or by searching out the published transcripts of the trial testimony in the library? I would vote for Koestler's book as the best route, precisely because of the intense emotions it evokes in most readers.

I could go down a long list of such alternatives: War and Peace versus a treatise on military sociology, Proust and Chekov versus a textbook on personality. If I were in a position ·where I had to defend the role of the humanities in education, to provide an argument for something like the traditional liberal arts curriculum of the earlv twen, tieth century, I would argue for them on the grounds that most human beings are able to attend to issues longer, to think harder about them, to receive deeper impressions that last longer, if information is presented in a context of emotion- a sort of hot dressing than if it is presented whollv without affect.

J

But educating with the help of hot cognition also implies a responsibility. If we are to learn our social science from novelists, then the novelists have to get it right. The scientific content must be valid. Freudian theory permeates a great deal of literature today-at the very time when Freudian theories are being revised radically by new psychological kno\vledge. There are few orthodox Freudians

left in psychology today. Hence there is a danger, if we take this route of asking the humanities to provide an emotional context for learning, that a kind of warmed-over Freud will be served to our students in a powerfully influential form. We have to re-evaluate the great humanist classics to see to what extent they suffer from obsolescence through the progress of our scientific knowledge.

Homer is still alive because the Iliad and the Odyssey treat mainly of matters in which modern social science has not progressed much beyond lay understanding. Aristotle is barely alive-and certainly his scientific works are not, and his logic hardly. And we could have a great argument with philosophers as to ·whether his epistemology or metaphysics has anything to say to students today. And Lucretius, of course, talking about atoms, has gone entirely.

his

The moral I draw is that, whereas works capable of evoking emotion inay have special value for us just by virtue of that capability, if we wish to use them to educate, we must evaluate not only their po\ver to rouse emotion but also their scientific validity when they speak of matters of fact.

If the humanities are to base their clain1s to a central place in the liberal curriculum on their special insights into the human condition> thev must be able to sho\v that their ' picture of that condition is biologically, sociologically, and psychologically defensible. It is not enough, for this particular purpose, that humanistic works move students.

They must move them in \vays that will enable them to live with due regard for reason and fact in the real world. I do not mean to imply that the humanities do not now meet this standard; a detailed assessment of the liberal curriculum in any existing university would certainly not give a simple yes-or-no answer to that question. But I do suggest that any examination of the appropriate roles of different fields of knowledge in providing the materials of a liberal education needs to give close attention both to the emotional temperature of material and to its empirical soundness.

### 1.7 Conclusion

In this first chapter, I have sought to present three visions of rationality: three ways of talking about rational choice. The first of these, the Olympian model, postulates a heroic man making comprehensive choices in an integrated universe. The Olympian vie\v serves, perhaps, as a model of the mind of God, but certainly not as a model of the mind of man. I have been rather critical of that theory for present purposes.

The second, the behavioral model, postulates that human rationality is very limited, very much bounded by the situation and by human computational powers. I have argued that there is a great deal of empirical evidence supporting this kind of theory as a valid description of ho\v human beings make decisions. It is a theory of how organisms, including man, possessing limited computational abilities, make adaptive choices and sometimes survive in a complex, but mostly empty, world.

The third, the intuitive model, places great stress on the processes of intuition. The intuitive theory, I have argued, is in fact a component of the behavioral theory. It emphasizes the recognition processes that underlie the skills humans can acquire by storing experience and by recognizing situations in which their experience is relevant and appropriate. The intuitive theory recognizes that human

thought is often affected by emotion, and addresses the question of what function emotion plays in focusing human attention on particular problems at particular times.

I have left for the next chapter a fourth theory: the vision of rationality as evolutionary adaptation. The evolutionary model is a de facto model of rationality; it implies that only those organisms that adapt, that behave as if they \Vere rational, will survive. In the next chapter, I shall examine these claims of the efficacy and centrality of natural selection as applied to the exercise of human rationality.
