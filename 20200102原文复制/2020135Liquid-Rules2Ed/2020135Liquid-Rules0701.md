9 / Cooling

AS I WALKED BACK from the loo, I passed one of the aircraft's big oval exit doors; it had a porthole and a temptingly large red handle. I always feel a strange desire to open aircraft doors; I'm not sure why. If I did, the air inside the cabin would be sucked out, along with me and anyone else not wearing a seat belt. Everyone who was strapped in would stay put, but the air temperature on the plane would drop to approximately –60ºF, and the air pressure would also drop, making it very difficult to breathe. At this point, as we know from the preflight safety briefing, the oxygen masks would fall from their overhead compartments.

The low air pressure at altitude is, of course, the very reason why we fly so high; the lower density of the air provides less resistance to our passage, making the aircraft more fuel-efficient and allowing it to fly farther. Nevertheless, it presents a dual problem for aircraft engineers: they have to find ways of keeping their passengers from asphyxiating and developing hypothermia. They've achieved this through air conditioning, and its history involves some of most dangerous liquids on the planet.

I returned to my seat and gave Susan an apologetic smile. I intended that one smile to convey to her that I was sorry for interrupting her reading, for making her unbuckle her seat belt, and, in forcing her to get up, for inadvertently dislodging the crumbs on her lap, though of course none of this was really my fault. It's a product of how airplane seats are arranged, and going to the lava tory is a perfectly natural thing to do anyway, even if I had been gone rather a long time.

Susan got up with a smile, which seemed to say to me:「It's fine to go to the loo, don't worry about it.」She squeezed out into the aisle, and I edged past her, back into my seat. We both buckled our seat belts as the plane jolted and rocked about. The turbulence was caused by changes in the density of the air we were flying through; because of weather patterns below, we were passing through a mixture of low- and high-density air. As the plane hit pockets of high-density air, it slowed, because of the increased drag on the airplane. Then when it came upon the low-density pockets, it would drop suddenly, as lower-density air provides less lift to the wings.

But despite the rapid changes in air pressure outside, my breathing was fairly normal; the cabin pressure, though lower than what I was used to, was not fluctuating. This was thanks to the air conditioning, a field of engineering so specialized that even Einstein became interested in it, in his day, and was awarded several patents for his innovations, although at the time he was more interested in saving lives on the ground than allowing people to breathe during long-haul flights.

The problem Einstein was trying to solve was this: In the 1920s, refrigerators, newly invented, were gaining in popularity, and iceboxes, which had been the way to keep things cool for hundreds of years, were being phased out of homes. But these early fridges were not very safe. Einstein had been shocked to read in the newspaper that a family living in Berlin, with several children, had been poisoned because the pump in their fridge leaked. At the time, refrigerators used one of three types of liquid coolant—methyl chloride, sulfur dioxide, or ammonia—and all are toxic. Manufacturers had chosen them because each has a low boiling point.

Refrigerators work by pumping liquids through a series of pipes contained within them. If the temperature in them is warmer than the boiling point of the liquids, they boil. Boiling requires input of energy to break the bonds between the molecules in the liquid (called latent heat), and this heat is taken from the air inside the fridge, cooling it down. Thus the need for low-boiling-point liquids: they need to boil at the temperature inside a fridge, around 40ºF. But for a fluid to be really useful in a fridge, you need to be able to turn it back into a liquid again by compressing it, using a pump.

In order to compress a gas into a liquid, you have to remove all of the latent heat from it—essentially, the heat is squeezed out of the gas. This happens at the back of a fridge—when the compressor is running, you can hear it; it is that hum that your fridge intermittently emits. It's why the back of your fridge is hot, and also why leaving your refrigerator open won't cool your home; whatever cooling is caused by the door being open is more than compensated for by the heat produced at the back by the pump, a manifestation of the first law of thermodynamics, which states that if we make something cool by taking energy out of it, then that energy has to go somewhere—it can't just disappear. So, in this case, the energy comes out of the back of the fridge.

It may sound easy to put a pump onto a set of tubes containing a liquid and then to add a valve to allow that liquid to turn into a gas, but it presents a considerable engineering challenge. The gas is under pressure, so the molecules are in constant motion, colliding against the inside of the tubes. Wherever the tubes connect with the pump there are weak points, places where, without the right materials, the constantly clamoring molecules, expanding and escaping, give way to material failure. Which is exactly what happened with early fridge designs. In the middle of the night, the ammonia leaked out and killed whole families in their beds.

Einstein wanted to do something about this, and having been a patent lawyer, he understood the technical intricacies of mechanical and electric machines. He began working with a physicist named Leo Szilard, and they set about trying to invent a new type of fridge, one that would be safer for families to use in their homes. They wanted to get rid of external pumps altogether, along with all the connectors that came with them, and instead make a system with no moving parts, which would therefore be much less likely to fail.

From 1926 to 1933 Szilard and Einstein worked together to develop different ways of manipulating liquids into gases, and then back again, to create a working fridge. Of course, as we just discovered, a liquid evaporating into a gas cools its surroundings. But going the other way, reclaiming the liquid, had always been done with a pump that forced gas molecules back into close proximity with one another, compressing them into a liquid again. There had to be a different way. Szilard and Einstein had many ideas. They built working prototypes and filed for several patents. One design used heat to drive liquid butane around a series of tubes, where it combined with ammonia to become a gas, creating a cooling effect; the gas was then mixed with water, which absorbed the ammonia and allowed the butane to be recirculated through the pipes, continuing the refrigeration process. The second had liquid metal, initially mercury, running through a series of tubes, which they vibrated using electromagnetic forces; the oscillation of the vibrating liquid acted as a piston to compress the refrigerant from a gas into a liquid—essentially creating refrigeration by having one liquid act on another liquid, without any moving solid parts. As with their other designs, the working fluids were hermetically sealed in tubes, and so, supposedly, safer than the models in use at the time.

While there was commercial interest in their prototypes—a Swedish company, Electrolux, bought up one patent, and a German company, Citogel, developed another—time was running out for the Szilard-Einstein partnership. By then the Nazis were gaining in popularity in Germany, and it was becoming more and more difficult for Jewish people like Szilard and Einstein to live and work within the country.

Szilard moved to Britain, where he came up with an invention that would change the course of history—not by cooling things down, but by heating them up. It was the principle behind the atomic bomb: the nuclear chain reaction. Meanwhile, Einstein toured Europe while an increasingly hostile Nazi party grew in power. Both Einstein and Szilard eventually ended up in America, where they were able to continue their collaboration, but by then it was too late. Scientists in America had also been working to make refrigerators safer, but they'd approached the problem the other way round—making the working fluids safer, rather than eliminating pumps. In 1930, the chemist Thomas Midgley invented Freon liquid; it was hailed as safe and cheap and put Einstein and Szilard out of the refrigeration business. Unfortunately, it turned out that Freon wasn't safe at all, but it would be fifty years before that came to light, even though Midgley was known for creating dangerous liquids.

In the 1920s, while working at General Motors, Thomas Midgley discovered a liquid called tetraethyllead, which, when added to gasoline, made it burn more completely, thus increasing the performance of gasoline engines. Tetraethyllead worked well, but it contained lead, which is highly toxic. Midgley poisoned himself while working with it.「After about a year's work in organic lead,」he wrote in January 1923,「I find that my lungs have been affected and that it is necessary to drop all work and get a large supply of fresh air.」Despite the clear dangers, he pressed on. It took many years, during which some of the production workers suffered lead poisoning, hallucinations, and death, but eventually, in 1924, Midgley held a press conference, demonstrating the safety of tetraethyllead. He poured the liquid over his hands and inhaled the vapor. Once again, he suffered from lead poisoning, but it didn't stop him from putting tetraethyllead into commercial production.

Tetraethyllead was subsequently used as an additive to gasoline around the world, but from the 1970s it started to be phased out, due to cumulative evidence of its toxicity (it was not completely banned in the UK until January 1, 2000). As a result, rates of lead concentration in the blood of children dropped dramatically, for example, and the social effects were widespread. A statistically significant correlation was found between the usage rate of leaded fuel and violent crime, for instance. Such is the potency of lead as a neurodegenerative substance; scientists have even speculated that banning leaded gasoline brought about a significant increase in the IQ level of people living in urban areas.

But that was all after Midgley began working on the problem of safe refrigeration. By the late 1920s, he'd found a solution. His team focused on small hydrocarbons like butane, which had a low boiling point. The downside of these substances was that they were all highly flammable and potentially explosive, which is why they're used as fuels in cigarette lighters and camping stoves.

The molecular structure of the CFC Freon.

Midgley's group replaced the hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon molecules with fluorine and chlorine, thus creating a new family of molecules called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). In doing this they were potentially making something even more dangerous than the small hydrocarbons they'd started with; if these new molecules were to decompose, they would form hydrogen fluoride, an extremely corrosive and toxic substance. But Midgley's team thought that kind of decomposition was highly unlikely because the fluorine-carbon bond was so strong, the liquid would be inert. And so it proved: chlorofluorocarbons are indeed chemically inert. They seemed to be the perfect chemical solution to the problem of refrigeration because if they leaked out of the back, they wouldn't kill anyone. Midgley was right about this, but he was otherwise wrong about the safety of CFCs.

Ever since their introduction, CFCs had been leaking from the back of fridges, but it seemed the main effect of this was just that the refrigerators would malfunction—they didn't kill anyone. And because they were so cheap to produce, CFCs brought about a huge surge in the popularity of refrigerators. In 1948, just 2 percent of people in the UK owned a fridge; by the 1970s, pretty much everyone did. It was a miracle, really. We went from a nation that ran on larders and cool boxes to a place where everyone had the means to cool and store their food and drinks. It made fresh food distribution radically more efficient, cutting food waste in fish, dairy, meat, and vegetables, and so making food cheaper. It was no less than a refrigeration revolution, all thanks to the seemly innocuous CFCs.

I felt in need of a bit of refrigeration myself, sitting on the stuffy plane. I fiddled with the nozzle over my seat to try to get a bit more air. It was stuck, and I had to lift myself off my seat to get a better grip. I finally got it open, and a gale of cool air poured down on me. I must have dislodged some dust from the seat because as I sat down again, I sneezed violently. It was one of those sudden and irrepressible sneezes that you can't do anything about, but it was a serious breach of airplane etiquette, especially since I hadn't managed to catch the sneeze with my elbow. The woman in front of me turned around and peered at me through the slit between the seats, registering her disapproval. A man standing in the aisle shot me a look of unbridled hatred. My fellow passengers no doubt assumed I had the flu, or something even worse, and that I'd recklessly boarded the plane with it, no doubt ignoring my doctor's advice not to travel. This is a crime we have all been guilty of at one time or another, I suppose, and it's a fact that viruses spread fast on planes because everyone's packed so tightly into a relatively small space. I felt terrible. And, to make matters worse, the sneeze had been a little wet; it was possible that the people in the seats in front of me might have felt a droplet or two. Susan had the most reason to feel affronted, but she said nothing, apparently glued to her book. I wanted to apologize, explain to everyone that the sneeze had been caused by dust, which had probably been dislodged into the air when I'd sat down, but I didn't know how to begin. So instead I got my handkerchief out and wiped my nose and the vinyl seat cover in front of me.

Air-conditioning systems are essentially refrigerators for air. For instance, the air-conditioning system for your car's interior passes the air over copper tubes containing refrigerant, thus cooling the air. Cool air can't maintain a high concentration of water, which is why water droplets form on air conditioners (this is also why clouds form as air rises and becomes cooler). Hence, a byproduct of air conditioning is dehumidified air. In hot, humid countries air conditioning is often the only way to make traveling by car, bus, or train tolerable. But it also consumes a huge amount of energy. In Singapore, for instance, about 50 percent of the energy consumption in homes and offices is for cooling. In the United States, the entire transport sector, including trains, planes, ships, trucks, and cars, accounts for 25 percent of the country's energy use, while the heating and cooling of buildings through air conditioning accounts for nearly 40 percent.

And just as the back of your fridge gets hot as a result of cooling the interior, so too does the air conditioning of a vehicle or building release that heat back into the environment, raising outside air temperatures. The overall effect of this isn't huge except in dense cities, where the rise in temperature due to air conditioning is appreciable. Scientists at Arizona State University have shown that, solely because of air conditioning, average nighttime temperatures have increased by more than 1.8ºF in urban areas. That doesn't sound like a lot, I admit, but remember, even a 3.6ºF increase in global average temperatures is likely to lead to severe climate change.

Making air conditioning more energy-efficient is thus a global challenge, and one to which, I'm proud to say, I've made a small contribution. To increase the efficiency of cooling systems, the heat has to conduct quickly through the metal pipes, which is why we use copper for air-conditioning pipes. Copper may be expensive, but it's a very good conductor of heat. But on a very hot day in a stuffy office, with the outside temperatures approaching 100ºF, even copper tube sometimes isn't enough to keep the room cool. The way the liquid coolant flows through the tubes can tip the balance, though.

Uniform flow, like water coming out of a pipe, is predictable, but its speed is inconsistent within the stream. Generally, the outer part of the flow, the part nearest the pipe—also called the boundary layer—is slower than the inner part. There isn't much thermal interaction between these two layers, which decreases the speed at which the heat is conducted away. The cooling system is considerably more efficient if you can achieve what's known as a turbulent flow. This is a chaotic state of flow, where the liquid tumbles and creates vortexes, mixing everything together quite thoroughly. Increasing the pressure is one way to get turbulence (turning the tap on all the way, so the water comes tumbling out of the pipe chaotically), but that uses up a lot of energy. It's better if you can disrupt the boundary layer, which we accomplish by mak ing helical grooves inside the copper pipe so that they break up the uniform flow by constantly mixing the liquid. This has become the preferred means of getting a turbulent flow, which allows the cooling liquid to extract heat more efficiently, radically increasing the efficiency of air conditioning without any extra energy expenditure. Genius, eh?

This wasn't my invention. Einstein missed it too, though, so I don't feel too bad.

This system of creating a turbulent flow was invented in the twentieth century, at a time when I was still learning to spell and Einstein was dead. But by the time I'd gone to school, then to university, and done a Ph.D., the state of the air-conditioning sector hadn't progressed beyond it. Energy efficiency was becoming a more important issue, and there was a lot of pressure to lower the costs of making the spiral, helical-grooved copper tube. So much so, that when I finished my Ph.D. on jet engine alloys, Professor Brian Derby at Oxford University asked me to help him solve the problem. Since this problem had nothing to do with jet engine alloys, I was, understandably I think, not sure how to proceed.

Grooved copper tubes are made through a process that's pretty similar to squeezing toothpaste—just imagine that instead of toothpaste, there's a bullet inside the tube, with a diameter that's slightly greater than the nozzle, so it doesn't squirt out when you squeeze. Instead, the bullet gets pushed against the nozzle, and the tube flows around it, which stretches out the copper. But because there are helical grooves on the bullet, as you squeeze, the bullet spins and carves its grooves into the inside of the copper tube. Magic! The only problem is that the bullet had to be made by bolting together several components made from a super-hard material called tungsten carbide, and inside the massive copper-squeezing machine the pressure often got so high that the bolts snapped off, the bullet fell apart, and the whole thing ended up in a big mess and cost millions of pounds to sort out.

Miraculously, we found a liquid that solved the problem. We determined that we could bond the two halves of the tungsten carbide bullet together by turning the inside of the material into liquid, while keeping the rest of the material solid. It's a kind of very precise welding. And as happens with a lot of discoveries, once you know the trick, it's easy to do. We just had to compress the two parts together and put them into a high-temperature furnace. This caused liquid to form inside the material; it flowed between the two pieces and then joined them together. Once it all cooled down, you were left with a single seamless piece of tungsten carbide. But that didn't mean the bullets would hold together through practical use. So I felt incredibly nervous when I traveled to a huge copper-pipe factory in St. Louis, Missouri, to see the first test of my tungsten-carbide bullet, knowing that if it did break, the test would cost the company tens of thousands of dollars. I am proud to say, though, that the liquid-phase bonding worked, and we filed for a European patent, Method of liquid phase bonding (WO1999015294 A1).

Finding ways to cool more efficiently is all well and good, but there were larger problems looming. So much work had gone into making cooling systems work better, but no one had thought about what would happen when the fridges and the air conditioners stopped working. They just went to the rubbish dump, where the valuable metals were salvaged—the steel from the frame of the fridge, and the copper tubes. No one collected the CFCs; they evaporated quickly, as soon as the copper pipes were cut, cooling them one last time as the liquid evaporated into thin air. No one was worried about them. CFCs were already being used as propellants in cans of hairspray and other disposable items: they were supposedly inert, so what harm could they do? It was just assumed that once they became a gas, they'd be dispersed by the wind. Which is exactly what happened. But over the course of decades they found their way into the stratosphere, where the ultraviolet light from the sun started to break them down into molecules that could do us a lot of harm.

The sun emits light we can see and light we can't see. Ultraviolet light is the latter. It's the light that gives us a tan, and because it has so much energy, it can and does burn us: prolonged exposure can damage your DNA, and eventually causes cancer. This is why wearing sunscreen is essential; the job of this liquid is to absorb ultraviolet light before it hits your skin. But there's another barrier between you and the ultraviolet light that's a lot more effective—the ozone layer. Ozone is like a sunscreen for the planet, and like sunscreen, it can't really be seen once it's been applied. In fact, our plane was currently flying through the ozone layer, but looking out the window, you'd have no idea.

Ozone is related to oxygen. The oxygen we breathe is a molecule made up of two oxygen atoms bonded together (O2); ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms bonded together (O3). It's not very stable, and being highly reactive, it doesn't stick around for long. Ozone also has a smell, which you can sometimes detect during the production of sparks—some of the O2 in the air is transformed into O3as it encounters the spark's high energy, and the resulting reaction produces a strange pungent smell. But while there's not a lot of ozone in the air we breathe down on here on terra firma, up in the stratosphere there's enough ozone to form a protective layer that absorbs ultraviolet light from the sun. But when CFC molecules find their way into the ozone layer, they break down after interacting with the high-energy rays of light emitted from the sun. This creates highly reactive molecules called free radicals; these then react with the ozone and decrease its concentration, thus depleting our ozone layer.

By the 1980s, atmospheric scientists had begun to realize that the effect of CFCs on our ozone layer was significant, and had huge consequences. In 1985, scientists from the British Antarctic Survey reported that there was a hole in the ozone layer, spanning eight million square miles, above Antarctica, and not long afterward it was determined that across the globe, the thickness of the ozone layer was degrading. CFCs are, by and large, to blame for this, and so an international ban, called the Montreal Protocol, was put in place and took effect in 1989. CFCs in refrigeration were banned, as was their use in dry cleaning, where they were used instead of water to clean clothes. But despite the swift response of the global community, there are still CFCs in circulation, and other holes have opened up in the ozone layer. In 2006, a hole measuring one million square miles was found over Tibet, and in 2011 there was a record loss of ozone over the Arctic, which suggests we won't be able to recover from all this damage until the end of the twenty-first century.

But back in the CFCs' heyday, chemists spent a lot of time exploring the properties of carbon- and fluorine-based molecules. They discovered an amazing family of molecules called perfluorocarbons, or PFCs. Unlike CFCs, PFCs don't contain any chlorine—they're liquids made entirely of carbon and fluorine atoms. The simplest PFCs resemble hydrocarbons in which all of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms.

The molecular structure of a perfluorocarbon molecule.

Fluorine bonds are extremely strong, so they're also very stable, making PFCs very inert. You can dunk pretty much anything you like into them with impunity, even your phone, which will continue to operate as if nothing had happened. You could put your laptop in a bucket of PFC—and people do, because the liquid cools them down during operation much more efficiently than their internal fans do, allowing the computers to operate at much higher speeds. But even more miraculous than that is the fact that PFCs are able to absorb a high concentration of oxygen—up to 20 percent of their volume, in fact—which means they can act as artificial blood.

Blood substitutes have a long history. Blood loss is a major cause of death, and the only way to get more blood into people is through a transfusion. But for a successful transfusion, you can't use just any blood. Human blood isn't all the same type; transferring blood from one person to another is successful only if their blood type matches. A scientist named Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types in the early 1900s, and classified them as A, B, O, and AB. In 1930 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this insight, and a decade later the enormous casualty count of the World War II led to the establishment of the world's first blood banks.

But because of the challenges of matching donated blood with patients, scientists have been on the hunt for a reliable synthetic blood, which would eliminate the need to match blood types and lessen the strain on blood banks. In 1854 some doctors used milk, with a degree of success, but it was never taken up by the medical establishment at large. Some people have also tried to use blood plasma extracted from animals, but that was found to be toxic. In 1883 a substance called Ringer's solution was developed, a solution of sodium, potassium, and calcium salts that's still used today, but as a blood-volume expander, rather than a true substitute for blood.

It wasn't until PFCs came along, though, that people really started to believe a viable artificial blood could be created. In 1966 Leland C. Clark Jr. and Frank Gollan, two medical scientists from the United States, began studying what would happen to rats if they inhaled liquid PFCs. They found that the mice were still able to breathe, even when fully submerged in a bath of liquid PFC, and then were able to breathe air again upon removal—effectively transitioning from a fishlike existence, where they obtained their oxygen from the PFC liquid, back to a mammalian one, where they got their oxygen from air. This so-called liquid-breathing appears to work not just because their lungs could obtain oxygen dissolved in the PFC, but also because the liquid can absorb all the carbon dioxide the mice were exhaling. Further studies have shown that mice can liquid-breathe for hours, and research continues, with the ultimate aim of figuring out how humans might be able to liquid-breathe. In the 1990s the first human trials were conducted. Patients with lung problems were asked to liquid-breathe, using PFCs that were loaded up with medication for their lungs. The therapy seems to work, but for the moment, not without side effects.

No one is quite sure where this strange technology might lead, but if PFCs do become prevalent in one way or another, we'll need to work out their potential environmental impact. The world has managed to avoid catastrophic loss of the ozone layer by banning CFC liquids and replacing them with fluids less damaging to the environment—these days the refrigerant in your fridge is likely to be butane. It's a highly flammable liquid, and if it leaks from the back of your fridge it could be hazardous, but it's still safer than the liquids used in Einstein's day, and it's a much better bet for the planet. Our protective sunscreen layer of ozone is too precious to destroy with CFCs.

But while the risk of using butane may be small enough for refrigerators, it's still too great for the engineers of aircraft. These days liquid refrigerants aren't used in aircraft air-conditioning systems. Instead, air is actually sucked in from outside the plane, and through a series of compression and expansion cycles is used to cool the interior—it's very cold out there, after all. The downside of this, though, is that when the plane is on the tarmac, the air conditioning doesn't work very well because the air on the ground is warmer. Which is why, adding to the general pleasures of sitting on a delayed flight, when you're stuck on a plane on the tarmac, waiting for takeoff, it can be sweltering.

A plane's air-conditioning system does more than just regulate temperature and humidity, though; it's also set to equilibrate the air pressure inside the cabin. At forty thousand feet, the air outside doesn't have enough oxygen for people to breathe easily—or at all. So the air pressure inside the cabin has to be a lot higher than the air pressure outside. This puts the skin of the fuselage in essentially the same state of stress as an inflated balloon, causing the aircraft to bulge. The bulging can lead to cracks, so to minimize the chances that they will form, the air-conditioning system makes a compromise: the pressure is set to be high enough to allow people to breathe normally, but not so high that the aircraft skin is put under undue stress. As the plane descends, the air-conditioning systems pump more air into the cabin to equilibrate to pressure levels on the ground, which is why your ears pop.

Planes don't carry liquid oxygen on board for emergencies. In case of a loss of cabin pressure, the masks that drop from the overhead compartment will supply you with oxygen made by a chemical oxygen generator—it creates oxygen gas through a chemical reaction, allowing it to be very compact and lightweight, both essential features for anything carried onboard an aircraft. I've never been on a flight during which oxygen masks have been deployed, and I'm fascinated by how well those systems are hidden. I was inspecting the overhead compartment, trying to figure out how it works, when the flight attendant leaned toward me with some urgency. He passed me a card. At first I was puzzled, but then I realized we must be approaching San Francisco. It was time to fill in my customs declaration form. For that I was going to need another liquid—ink.
