# 1001. The Drunkard's Walk

IN 1814, near the height of the great successes of Newtonian physics, Pierre-Simon de Laplace wrote:

If an intelligence, at a given instant, knew all the forces that animate nature and the position of each constituent being; if, moreover, this intelligence were sufficiently great to submit these data to analysis, it could embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies in the universe and those of the smallest atoms: to this intelligence nothing would be uncertain, and the future, as the past, would be present to its eyes.1

Laplace was expressing a view called determinism: the idea that the state of the world at the present determines precisely the manner in which the future will unfold.

In everyday life, determinism implies a world in which our personal qualities and the properties of any given situation or environment lead directly and unequivocally to precise consequences. That is an orderly world, one in which everything can be foreseen, computed, predicted. But for Laplace's dream to hold true, several conditions must be met. First, the laws of nature must dictate a definite future, and we must know those laws. Second, we must have access to data that completely describe the system of interest, allowing no unforeseen influences. Finally, we must have sufficient intelligence or computing power to be able to decide what, given the data about the present, the laws say the future will hold. In this book we've examined many concepts that aid our understanding of random phenomena. Along the way we've gained insight into a variety of specific life situations. Yet there remains the big picture, the question of how much randomness contributes to where we are in life and how well we can predict where we are going.

In the study of human affairs from the late Renaissance to the Victorian era, many scholars shared Laplace's belief in determinism. They felt as Galton did that our path in life is strictly determined by our personal qualities, or like Quételet they believed that the future of society is predictable. Often they were inspired by the success of Newtonian physics and believed that human behavior could be foretold as reliably as other phenomena in nature. It seemed reasonable to them that the future events of the everyday world should be as rigidly determined by the present state of affairs as are the orbits of the planets.

In the 1960s a meteorologist named Edward Lorenz sought to employ the newest technology of his day — a primitive computer — to carry out Laplace's program in the limited realm of the weather. That is, if Lorenz supplied his noisy machine with data on the atmospheric conditions of his idealized earth at some given time, it would employ the known laws of meteorology to calculate and print out rows of numbers representing the weather conditions at future times.

One day, Lorenz decided he wanted to extend a particular simulation further into the future. Instead of repeating the entire calculation, he decided to take a shortcut by beginning the calculation midway through. To accomplish that, he employed as initial conditions data printed out in the earlier simulation. He expected the computer to regenerate the remainder of the previous simulation and then carry it further. But instead he noticed something strange: the weather had evolved differently. Rather than duplicating the end of the previous simulation, the new one diverged wildly. He soon recognized why: in the computer's memory the data were stored to six decimal places, but in the printout they were quoted to only three. As a result, the data he had supplied were a tiny bit off. A number like 0.293416, for example, would have appeared simply as 0.293.

Scientists usually assume that if the initial conditions of a system are altered slightly, the evolution of that system, too, will be altered slightly. After all, the satellites that collect weather data can measure parameters to only two or three decimal places, and so they cannot even track a difference as tiny as that between 0.293416 and 0.293. But Lorenz found that such small differences led to massive changes in the result.2 The phenomenon was dubbed the butterfly effect, based on the implication that atmospheric changes so small they could have been caused by a butterfly flapping its wings can have a large effect on subsequent global weather patterns. That notion might sound absurd — the equivalent of the extra cup of coffee you sip one morning leading to profound changes in your life. But actually that does happen — for instance, if the extra time you spent caused you to cross paths with your future wife at the train station or to miss being hit by a car that sped through a red light. In fact, Lorenz's story is itself an example of the butterfly effect, for if he hadn't taken the minor decision to extend his calculation employing the shortcut, he would not have discovered the butterfly effect, a discovery which sparked a whole new field of mathematics. When we look back in detail on the major events of our lives, it is not uncommon to be able to identify such seemingly inconsequential random events that led to big changes.

Determinism in human affairs fails to meet the requirements for predictability alluded to by Laplace for several reasons. First, as far as we know, society is not governed by definite and fundamental laws in the way physics is. Instead, people's behavior is not only unpredictable, but as Kahneman and Tversky repeatedly showed, also often irrational (in the sense that we act against our best interests). Second, even if we could uncover the laws of human affairs, as Quételet attempted to do, it is impossible to precisely know or control the circumstances of life. That is, like Lorenz, we cannot obtain the precise data necessary for making predictions. And third, human affairs are so complex that it is doubtful we could carry out the necessary calculations even if we understood the laws and possessed the data. As a result, determinism is a poor model for the human experience. Or as the Nobel laureate Max Born wrote,「Chance is a more fundamental conception than causality.」3

In the scientific study of random processes the drunkard's walk is the archetype. In our lives it also provides an apt model, for like the granules of pollen floating in the Brownian fluid, we're continually nudged in this direction and then that one by random events. As a result, although statistical regularities can be found in social data, the future of particular individuals is impossible to predict, and for our particular achievements, our jobs, our friends, our finances, we all owe more to chance than many people realize. On the following pages, I shall argue, furthermore, that in all except the simplest real-life endeavors unforeseeable or unpredictable forces cannot be avoided, and moreover those random forces and our reactions to them account for much of what constitutes our particular path in life. I will begin my argument by exploring an apparent contradiction to that idea: if the future is really chaotic and unpredictable, why, after events have occurred, does it often seem as if we should have been able to foresee them?

IN THE FALL OF 1941, a few months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, an agent in Tokyo sent a spy in Honolulu an alarming request.4 The request was intercepted and sent to the Office of Naval Intelligence. It wended its way through the bureaucracy, reaching Washington in decoded and translated form on October 9. The message requested the Japanese agent in Honolulu to divide Pearl Harbor into five areas and to make reports on ships in the harbor with reference to those areas. Of special interest were battleships, destroyers, and aircraft carriers, as well as information regarding the anchoring of more than one ship at a single dock. Some weeks later another curious incident occurred: U.S. monitors lost track of radio communications from all known carriers in the first and second Japanese fleets, losing with it all knowledge of their whereabouts. Then in early December the Combat Intelligence Unit of the Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii reported that the Japanese had changed their call signs for the second time in a month. Call signs, such as WCBS or KNPR, are designations identifying the source of a radio transmission. In wartime they reveal the identity of a source not only to friend but also to foe, so they are periodically altered. The Japanese had a habit of changing them every six months or more. To change them twice in thirty days was considered a「step in preparing for active operations on a large scale.」The change made identification of the whereabouts of Japanese carriers and submarines in the ensuing days difficult, further confusing the issue of the radio silence.

Two days later messages sent to Japanese diplomatic and consular posts at Hong Kong, Singapore, Batavia, Manila, Washington, and London were intercepted and decoded. They called for the diplomats to destroy most of their codes and ciphers immediately and to burn all other important confidential and secret documents. Around that time the FBI also intercepted a telephone call from a cook at the Japanese consulate in Hawaii to someone in Honolulu reporting in great excitement that the officials there were burning all major documents. The assistant head of the main unit of army intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel George W. Bicknell, brought one of the intercepted messages to his boss as he was preparing to go to dinner with the head of the army's Hawaiian Department. It was late afternoon on Saturday, December 6, the day before the attack. Bicknell's higher-up took five minutes to consider the message, then dismissed it and went to eat. With events so foreboding when considered in hindsight, why hadn't anyone privy to this information seen the attack coming?

In any complex string of events in which each event unfolds with some element of uncertainty, there is a fundamental asymmetry between past and future. This asymmetry has been the subject of scientific study ever since Boltzmann made his statistical analysis of the molecular processes responsible for the properties of fluids (see chapter 8). Imagine, for example, a dye molecule floating in a glass of water. The molecule will, like one of Brown's granules, follow a drunkard's walk. But even that aimless movement makes progress in some direction. If you wait three hours, for example, the molecule will typically have traveled about an inch from where it started. Suppose that at some point the molecule moves to a position of significance and so finally attracts our attention. As many did after Pearl Harbor, we might look for the reason why that unexpected event occurred. Now suppose we dig into the molecule's past. Suppose, in fact, we trace the record of all its collisions. We will indeed discover how first this bump from a water molecule and then that one propelled the dye molecule on its zigzag path from there to here. In hindsight, in other words, we can clearly explain why the past of the dye molecule developed as it did. But the water contains many other water molecules that could have been the ones that interacted with the dye molecule. To predict the dye molecule's path beforehand would have therefore required us to calculate the paths and mutual interactions of all those potentially important water molecules. That would have involved an almost unimaginable number of mathematical calculations, far greater in scope and difficulty than the list of collisions needed to understand the past. In other words, the movement of the dye molecule was virtually impossible to predict before the fact even though it was relatively easy to understand afterward.

That fundamental asymmetry is why in day-to-day life the past often seems obvious even when we could not have predicted it. It's why weather forecasters can tell you the reasons why three days ago the cold front moved like this and yesterday the warm front moved like that, causing it to rain on your romantic garden wedding, but the same forecasters are much less successful at knowing how the fronts will behave three days hence and at providing the warning you would have needed to get that big tent ready. Or consider a game of chess. Unlike card games, chess involves no explicit random element. And yet there is uncertainty because neither player knows for sure what his or her opponent will do next. If the players are expert, at most points in the game it may be possible to see a few moves into the future; if you look out any further, the uncertainty will compound, and no one will be able to say with any confidence exactly how the game will turn out. On the other hand, looking back, it is usually easy to say why each player made the moves he or she made. This again is a probabilistic process whose future is difficult to predict but whose past is easy to understand.

The same thing is true of the stock market. Consider, for instance, the performance of mutual funds. As I mentioned in chapter 9, it is common, when choosing a mutual fund, to look at past performance. Indeed, it is easy to find nice, orderly patterns when looking back. Here, for example, is a graph of the performance of 800 mutual fund managers over the five-year period, 1991–1995.

Performance versus ranking of the top mutual funds in the five-year period 1991–1995.

On the vertical axis are plotted the funds' gains or losses relative to the average fund of the group. In other words, a return of 0 percent means the fund's performance was average for this five-year period. On the horizontal axis is plotted the managers' relative rank, from the number-1 performer to the number-800 performer. To look up the performance of, say, the 100th most successful mutual fund manager in the given five-year period, you find the point on the graph corresponding to the spot labeled 100 on the horizontal axis.

Any analyst, no doubt, could give a number of convincing reasons why the top managers represented here succeeded, why the bottom ones failed, and why the curve should take this shape. And whether or not we take the time to follow such analyses in detail, few are the investors who would choose a fund that has performed 10 percent below average in the past five years over a fund that has done 10 percent better than average. It is easy, looking at the past, to construct such nice graphs and neat explanations, but this logical picture of events is just an illusion of hindsight with little relevance for predicting future events. In the graph on chapter 10, for example, I compare how the same funds, still ranked in order of their performance in the initial five-year period, performed in the next five-year period. In other words, I maintain the ranking based on the period 1991–1995, but display the return the funds achieved in 1996–2000. If the past were a good indication of the future, the funds I considered in the period 1991–1995 would have had more or less the same relative performance in 1996–2000. That is, if the winners (at the left of the graph) continued to do better than the others, and the losers (at the right) worse, this graph should be nearly identical to the last. Instead, as we can see, the order of the past dissolves when extrapolated to the future, and the graph ends up looking like random noise.

People systematically fail to see the role of chance in the success of ventures and in the success of people like the equity-fund manager Bill Miller. And we unreasonably believe that the mistakes of the past must be consequences of ignorance or incompetence and could have been remedied by further study and improved insight. That's why, for example, in spring 2007, when the stock of Merrill Lynch was trading around `$`95 a share, its CEO E. Stanley O'Neal could be celebrated as the risk-taking genius responsible, and in the fall of 2007, after the credit market collapsed, derided as the risk-taking cowboy responsible — and promptly fired. We afford automatic respect to superstar business moguls, politicians, and actors and to anyone flying around in a private jet, as if their accomplishments must reflect unique qualities not shared by those forced to eat commercial-airline food. And we place too much confidence in the overly precise predictions of people — political pundits, financial experts, business consultants — who claim a track record demonstrating expertise.

How the top funds in 1991–1995 performed in 1996–2000.

One large publishing company I'm familiar with went to great pains to develop one-year, three-year, and five-year plans for its educational software division. There were high-paid consultants, lengthy marketing meetings, late-night financial-analysis sessions, long offsite afternoon powwows. In the end, hunches were turned into formulas claiming the precision of several decimal places, and wild guesses were codified as likely outcomes. When in the first year certain products didn't sell as well as expected or others sold better than projected, reasons were found and the appropriate employees blamed or credited as if the initial expectations had been meaningful. The next year saw a series of unforeseen price wars started by two competitors. The year after that the market for educational software collapsed. As the uncertainty compounded, the three-year plan never had a chance to succeed. And the five-year plan, polished and precise as a diamond, was spared any comparison with performance, for by then virtually everyone in the division had moved on to greener pastures.

Historians, whose profession is to study the past, are as wary as scientists of the idea that events unfold in a manner that can be predicted. In fact, in the study of history the illusion of inevitability has such serious consequences that it is one of the few things that both conservative and socialist historians can agree on. The socialist historian Richard Henry Tawney, for example, put it like this:「Historians give an appearance of inevitability…by dragging into prominence the forces which have triumphed and thrusting into the background those which they have swallowed up.」5 And the historian Roberta Wohlstetter, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan, said it this way:「After the event, of course, a signal is always crystal clear; we can now see what disaster it was signaling…. But before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings.」6

In some sense this idea is encapsulated in the cliché that hindsight is always 20/20, but people often behave as if the adage weren't true. In government, for example, a should-have-known-it blame game is played after every tragedy. In the case of Pearl Harbor (and the September 11 attacks) the events leading up to the attack, when we look back at them, certainly seem to point in an obvious direction. Yet as with the dye molecule, the weather, or the chess game, if you start well before the fact and trace events forward, the feeling of inevitability quickly dissolves. For one thing, in addition to the intelligence reports I quoted, there was a huge amount of useless intelligence, with each week bringing new reams of sometimes alarming or mysterious messages and transcripts that would later prove misleading or insignificant. And even if we focused on the reports that hindsight tells us were important, before the attack there existed for each of those reports a reasonable alternative explanation that did not point toward a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. For example, the request to divide Pearl Harbor into five areas was similar in style to other requests that had gone to Japanese agents in Panama, Vancouver, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon. The loss of radio contact was also not unheard of and had in the past often meant simply that the warships were in home waters and communicating via telegraphic landlines. Moreover, even if you believed a broadening of the war was impending, many signs pointed toward an attack elsewhere — in the Philippines, on the Thai peninsula, or on Guam, for example. There were not, to be sure, as many red herrings as water molecules encountered by a molecule of dye, but there were enough to obscure a clear vision of the future.

After Pearl Harbor seven committees of the U.S. Congress delved into the process of discovering why the military had missed all the「signs」of a coming attack. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall, for one, drew heavy criticism for a May 1941 memo to President Roosevelt in which he wrote that「the Island of Oahu, due to its fortification, its garrison and its physical characteristic, is believed to be the strongest fortress in the world」and reassured the president that, in case of attack, enemy forces would be intercepted「within 200 miles of their objective…by all types of bombardment.」General Marshall was no fool, but neither did he have a crystal ball. The study of randomness tells us that the crystal ball view of events is possible, unfortunately, only after they happen. And so we believe we know why a film did well, a candidate won an election, a storm hit, a stock went down, a soccer team lost, a new product failed, or a disease took a turn for the worse, but such expertise is empty in the sense that it is of little use in predicting when a film will do well, a candidate will win an election, a storm will hit, a stock will go down, a soccer team will lose, a new product will fail, or a disease will take a turn for the worse.

It is easy to concoct stories explaining the past or to become confident about dubious scenarios for the future. That there are traps in such endeavors doesn't mean we should not undertake them. But we can work to immunize ourselves against our errors of intuition. We can learn to view both explanations and prophecies with skepticism. We can focus on the ability to react to events rather than relying on the ability to predict them, on qualities like flexibility, confidence, courage, and perseverance. And we can place more importance on our direct impressions of people than on their well-trumpeted past accomplishments. In these ways we can resist forming judgments in our automatic deterministic framework.

IN MARCH 1979 another famously unanticipated chain of events occurred, this one at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.7 It resulted in a partial meltdown of the core, in which the nuclear reaction occurs, threatening to release into the environment an alarming dose of radiation. The mishap began when a cup or so of water emerged through a leaky seal from a water filter called a polisher. The leaked water entered a pneumatic system that drives some of the plant's instruments, tripping two valves. The tripped valves shut down the flow of cold water to the plant's steam generator — the system responsible for removing the heat generated by the nuclear reaction in the core. An emergency water pump then came on, but a valve in each of its two pipes had been left in a closed position after maintenance two days earlier. The pumps therefore were pumping water uselessly toward a dead end. Moreover, a pressure-relief valve also failed, as did a gauge in the control room that ought to have shown that the valve was not working.

Viewed separately, each of the failures was of a type considered both commonplace and acceptable. Polisher problems were not unusual at the plant, nor were they normally very serious; with hundreds of valves regularly being opened or closed in a nuclear power plant, leaving some valves in the wrong position was not considered rare or alarming; and the pressure-relief valve was known to be somewhat unreliable and had failed at times without major consequences in at least eleven other power plants. Yet strung together, these failures make the plant seem as if it had been run by the Keystone Kops. And so after the incident at Three Mile Island came many investigations and much laying of blame, as well as a very different consequence. That string of events spurred Yale sociologist Charles Perrow to create a new theory of accidents, in which is codified the central argument of this chapter: in complex systems (among which I count our lives) we should expect that minor factors we can usually ignore will by chance sometimes cause major incidents.8

In his theory Perrow recognized that modern systems are made up of thousands of parts, including fallible human decision makers, which interrelate in ways that are, like Laplace's atoms, impossible to track and anticipate individually. Yet one can bet on the fact that just as atoms executing a drunkard's walk will eventually get somewhere, so too will accidents eventually occur. Called normal accident theory, Perrow's doctrine describes how that happens — how accidents can occur without clear causes, without those glaring errors and incompetent villains sought by corporate or government commissions. But although normal accident theory is a theory of why, inevitably, things sometimes go wrong, it could also be flipped around to explain why, inevitably, they sometimes go right. For in a complex undertaking, no matter how many times we fail, if we keep trying, there is often a good chance we will eventually succeed. In fact, economists like W. Brian Arthur argue that a concurrence of minor factors can even lead companies with no particular edge to come to dominate their competitors.「In the real world,」he wrote,「if several similar-sized firms entered a market together, small fortuitous events — unexpected orders, chance meetings with buyers, managerial whims — would help determine which ones received early sales and, over time, which came to dominate. Economic activity is…[determined] by individual transactions that are too small to foresee, and these small ‘random' events could [ac]cumulate and become magnified by positive feedbacks over time.」9

The same phenomenon has been noticed by researchers in sociology. One group, for example, studied the buying habits of consumers in what sociologists call the cultural industries — books, film, art, music. The conventional marketing wisdom in those fields is that success is achieved by anticipating consumer preference. In this view the most productive way for executives to spend their time is to study what it is about the likes of Stephen King, Madonna, or Bruce Willis that appeals to so many fans. They study the past and, as I've just argued, have no trouble extracting reasons for whatever success they are attempting to explain. They then try to replicate it.

That is the deterministic view of the marketplace, a view in which it is mainly the intrinsic qualities of the person or the product that governs success. But there is another way to look at it, a nondeterministic view. In this view there are many high-quality but unknown books, singers, actors, and what makes one or another come to stand out is largely a conspiracy of random and minor factors — that is, luck. In this view the traditional executives are just spinning their wheels.

Thanks to the Internet, this idea has been tested. The researchers who tested it focused on the music market, in which Internet sales are coming to dominate. For their study they recruited 14,341 participants who were asked to listen to, rate, and if they desired, download 48 songs by bands they had not heard of.10 Some of the participants were also allowed to view data on the popularity of each song — that is, on how many fellow participants had downloaded it. These participants were divided into eight separate「worlds」and could see only the data on downloads of people in their own world. All the artists in all the worlds began with zero downloads, after which each world evolved independently. There was also a ninth group of participants, who were not shown any data. The researchers employed the popularity of the songs in this latter group of insulated listeners to define the「intrinsic quality」of each song — that is, its appeal in the absence of external influence.

If the deterministic view of the world were true, the same songs ought to have dominated in each of the eight worlds, and the popularity rankings in those worlds ought to have agreed with the intrinsic quality as determined by the isolated individuals. But the researchers found exactly the opposite: the popularity of individual songs varied widely among the different worlds, and different songs of similar intrinsic quality also varied widely in their popularity. For example, a song called「Lockdown」by a band called 52metro ranked twenty-six out of forty-eight in intrinsic quality but was the number-1 song in one world and the number-40 song in another. In this experiment, as one song or another by chance got an early edge in downloads, its seeming popularity influenced future shoppers. It's a phenomenon that is well-known in the movie industry: moviegoers will report liking a movie more when they hear beforehand how good it is. In this example, small chance influences created a snowball effect and made a huge difference in the future of the song. Again, it's the butterfly effect.

In our lives, too, we can see through the microscope of close scrutiny that many major events would have turned out differently were it not for the random confluence of minor factors, people we've met by chance, job opportunities that randomly came our way. For example, consider the actor who, for seven years starting in the late 1970s, lived in a fifth-floor walk-up on Forty-ninth Street in Manhattan, struggling to make a name for himself. He worked off-Broadway, sometimes far off, and in television commercials, taking all the steps he could to get noticed, build a career, and earn the money to eat an occasional hanger steak in a restaurant without having to duck out before the check arrived. And like many other wannabes, no matter how hard this aspiring actor worked to get the right parts, make the right career choices, and excel in his trade, his most reliable role remained the one he played in his other career — as a bartender. Then one day in the summer of 1984 he flew to Los Angeles, either to attend the Olympics (if you believe his publicist) or to visit a girlfriend (if you believe The New York Times). Whichever account is accurate, one thing is clear: the decision to visit the West Coast had little to do with acting and much to do with love, or at least the love of sports. Yet it proved to be the best career decision he ever made, most likely the best decision of his life.

The actor's name is Bruce Willis, and while he was in Los Angeles, an agent suggested he go on a few television auditions.11 One was for a show in its final stages of casting. The producers already had a list of finalists in mind, but in Hollywood nothing is final until the ink on the contract is dry and the litigation has ended. Willis got his audition and landed the role — that of David Addison, the male lead paired with Cybill Shepherd in a new ABC offering called Moonlighting.

It might be tempting to believe that Willis was the obvious choice over Mr. X, the fellow at the top of the list when the newcomer arrived, and that the rest is, as they say, history. Since in hindsight we know that Moonlighting and Willis became huge successes, it is hard to imagine the assemblage of Hollywood decision makers, upon seeing Willis, doing anything but lighting up stogies as they celebrated their brilliant discovery and put to flame their now-outmoded list of finalists. But what really happened at the casting session is more like what you get when you send your kids out for a single gallon of ice cream and two want strawberry while the third demands triple-chocolate-fudge brownie. The network executives fought for Mr. X, their judgment being that Willis did not look like a serious lead. Glenn Caron, Moonlighting's executive producer, argued for Willis. It is easy, looking back, to dismiss the network executives as ignorant buffoons. In my experience, television producers often do, especially when the executives are out of earshot. But before we make that choice, consider this: television viewers at first agreed with the executives' mediocre assessment. Moonlighting debuted in March 1985 to low ratings and continued with a mediocre performance through the rest of its first season. Only in the second season did viewers change their minds and the show become a major hit. Willis's appeal and his success were apparently unforeseeable until, of course, he suddenly became a star. One might at this point chalk up the story to crazy Hollywood, but Willis's drunkard's walk to success is not at all unusual. A path punctuated by random impacts and unintended consequences is the path of many successful people, not only in their careers but also in their loves, hobbies, and friendships. In fact, it is more the rule than the exception.

I was watching late-night television recently when another star, though not one from the entertainment world, appeared for an interview. His name is Bill Gates. Though the interviewer is known for his sarcastic approach, toward Gates he seemed unusually deferential. Even the audience seemed to ogle Gates. The reason, of course, is that for thirteen years straight Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes magazine. In fact, since founding Microsoft, Gates has earned more than `$`100 a second. And so when he was asked about his vision for interactive television, everyone waited with great anticipation to hear what he had to say. But his answer was ordinary, no more creative, ingenious, or insightful than anything I've heard from a dozen other computer professionals. Which brings us to this question: does Gates earn `$`100 per second because he is godlike, or is he godlike because he earns `$`100 per second?

In August 1980, when a group of IBM employees working on a secret project to build a personal computer flew to Seattle to meet with the young computer entrepreneur, Bill Gates was running a small company and IBM needed a program, called an operating system, for its planned「home computer.」Recollections of the ensuing events vary, but the gist goes like this:12 Gates said he couldn't provide the operating system and referred the IBM people to a famed programmer named Gary Kildall at Digital Research Inc. The talks between IBM and Kildall did not go well. For one thing, when IBM showed up at DRI's offices, Kildall's then wife, the company's business manager, refused to sign IBM's nondisclosure agreement. The IBM emissaries called again, and that time Kildall did meet with them. No one knows exactly what transpired in that meeting, but if an informal deal was made, it didn't stick. Around that time one of the IBM employees, Jack Sams, saw Gates again. They both knew of another operating system that was available, a system that was, depending on whom you ask, based on or inspired by Kildall's. According to Sams, Gates said,「Do you want to get…[that operating system], or do you want me to?」Sams, apparently not appreciating the implications, said,「By all means, you get it.」Gates did, for `$`50,000 (or, by some accounts, a bit more), made a few changes, and renamed it DOS (disk operating system). IBM, apparently with little faith in the potential of its new idea, licensed DOS from Gates for a low per-copy royalty fee, letting Gates retain the rights. DOS was no better — and many, including most computer professionals, would claim far worse — than, say, Apple's Macintosh operating system. But the growing base of IBM users encouraged software developers to write for DOS, thereby encouraging prospective users to buy IBM machines, a circumstance that in turn encouraged software developers to write for DOS. In other words, as W. Brian Arthur would say, people bought DOS because people were buying DOS. In the fluid world of computer entrepreneurs, Gates became the molecule that broke from the pack. But had it not been for Kildall's uncooperativeness, IBM's lack of vision, or the second encounter between Sams and Gates, despite whatever visionary or business acumen Gates possesses, he might have become just another software entrepreneur rather than the richest man in the world, and that is probably why his vision seems like that of just that — another software entrepreneur.

Our society can be quick to make wealthy people into heroes and poor ones into goats. That's why the real estate mogul Donald Trump, whose Plaza Hotel went bankrupt and whose casino empire went bankrupt twice (a shareholder who invested `$`10,000 in his casino company in 1994 would thirteen years later have come away with `$`636),13 nevertheless dared to star in a wildly successful television program in which he judged the business acumen of aspiring young people.

Obviously it can be a mistake to assign brilliance in proportion to wealth. We cannot see a person's potential, only his or her results, so we often misjudge people by thinking that the results must reflect the person. The normal accident theory of life shows not that the connection between actions and rewards is random but that random influences are as important as our qualities and actions.

On an emotional level many people resist the idea that random influences are important even if, on an intellectual level, they understand that they are. If people underestimate the role of chance in the careers of moguls, do they also downplay its role in the lives of the least successful? In the 1960s that question inspired the social psychologist Melvin Lerner to look into society's negative attitudes toward the poor.14 Realizing that「few people would engage in extended activity if they believed that there were a random connection between what they did and the rewards they received,」15 Lerner concluded that「for the sake of their own sanity,」people overestimate the degree to which ability can be inferred from success.16 We are inclined, that is, to see movie stars as more talented than aspiring movie stars and to think that the richest people in the world must also be the smartest.

WE MIGHT NOT THINK we judge people according to their income or outward signs of success, but even when we know for a fact that a person's salary is completely random, many people cannot avoid making the intuitive judgment that salary is correlated with worth. Melvin Lerner examined that issue by arranging for subjects to sit in a small darkened auditorium facing a one-way mirror.17 From their seats these observers could gaze into a small well-lit room containing a table and two chairs. The observers were led to believe that two workers, Tom and Bill, would soon enter the room and work together for fifteen minutes unscrambling anagrams. The curtains in front of the viewing window were then closed, and Lerner told the observers that he would keep the curtains shut because the experiment would go better if they could hear but not see the workers, so that they would not be influenced by their appearance. He also told them that because his funds were limited, he could pay only one of the workers, who would be chosen at random. As Lerner left the room, an assistant threw a switch that began to play an audiotape. The observers believed they were listening in as Tom and Bill entered the room behind the curtain and began their work. Actually they were listening to a recording of Tom and Bill reading a fixed script, which had been constructed such that, by various objective measures, each of them appeared to be equally adept and successful at his task. Afterward the observers, not knowing this, were asked to rate Tom and Bill on their effort, creativity, and success. When Tom was selected to receive the payment, about 90 percent of the observers rated him as having made the greater contribution. When Bill was selected, about 70 percent of the observers rated him higher. Despite Tom and Bill's equivalent performance and the observers' knowledge that the pay was randomly assigned, the observers perceived the worker who got paid as being better than the one who had worked for nothing. Alas, as all of those who dress for success know, we are all too easily fooled by the money someone earns.

A series of related studies investigated the same effect from the point of view of the workers themselves.18 Everyone knows that bosses with the right social and academic credentials and a nice title and salary have at times put a higher value on their own ideas than on those of their underlings. Researchers wondered, will people who earn more money purely by chance behave the same way? Does even unearned「success」instill a feeling of superiority? To find out, pairs of volunteers were asked to cooperate on various pointless tasks. In one task, for instance, a black-and-white image was briefly displayed and the subjects had to decide whether the top or the bottom of the image contained a greater proportion of white. Before each task began, one of the subjects was randomly chosen to receive considerably more pay for participating than the other. When that information was not made available, the subjects cooperated pretty harmoniously. But when they knew how much they each were getting paid, the higher-paid subjects exhibited more resistance to input from their partners than the lower-paid ones. Even random differences in pay lead to the backward inference of differences in skill and hence to the development of unequal influence. It's an element of personal and office dynamics that cannot be ignored.

But it is the other side of the question that was closer to the original motivation for Lerner's work. With a colleague, Lerner asked whether people are inclined to feel that those who are not successful or who suffer deserve their fate.19 In that study small groups of female college students gathered in a waiting room. After a few minutes one was selected and led out. That student, whom I will call the victim, was not really a test subject but had been planted in the room by the experimenters. The remaining subjects were told that they would observe the victim working at a learning task and that each time she made an incorrect response, she would receive an electric shock. The experimenter adjusted some knobs said to control the shock levels, and then a video monitor was turned on. The subjects watched as the victim entered an adjoining room, was strapped to a「shock apparatus,」and then attempted to learn pairs of nonsense syllables.

During the task the victim received several apparently painful electric shocks for her incorrect responses. She reacted with exclamations of pain and suffering. In reality the victim was acting, and what played on the monitor was a prerecorded tape. At first, as expected, most of the observers reported being extremely upset by their peer's unjust suffering. But as the experiment continued, their sympathy for the victim began to erode. Eventually the observers, powerless to help, instead began to denigrate the victim. The more the victim suffered, the lower their opinion of her became. As Lerner had predicted, the observers had a need to understand the situation in terms of cause and effect. To be certain that some other dynamic wasn't really at work, the experiment was repeated with other groups of subjects, who were told that the victim would be well compensated for her pain. In other words, these subjects believed that the victim was being「fairly」treated but were otherwise exposed to the same scenario. Those observers did not develop a tendency to think poorly of the victim. We unfortunately seem to be unconsciously biased against those in society who come out on the bottom.

We miss the effects of randomness in life because when we assess the world, we tend to see what we expect to see. We in effect define degree of talent by degree of success and then reinforce our feelings of causality by noting the correlation. That's why although there is sometimes little difference in ability between a wildly successful person and one who is not as successful, there is usually a big difference in how they are viewed. Before Moonlighting, if you were told by the young bartender Bruce Willis that he hoped to become a film star, you would not have thought, gee, I sure am lucky to have this chance to chat one-on-one with a charismatic future celebrity, but rather you would have thought something more along the lines of yeah, well, for now just make sure not to overdo it on the vermouth. The day after the show became a hit, however, everyone suddenly viewed Bruce Willis as a star, a guy who has that something special it takes to capture viewers' hearts and imagination.

The power of expectations was dramatically illustrated in a bold experiment conducted years ago by the psychologist David L. Rosenhan.20 In that study each of eight「pseudopatients」made an appointment at one of a variety of hospitals and then showed up at the admissions office complaining that they were hearing strange voices. The pseudopatients were a varied group: three psychologists, a psychiatrist, a pediatrician, a student, a painter, and a housewife. Other than alleging that single symptom and reporting false names and vocations, they all described their lives with complete honesty. Confident in the clockwork operation of our mental health system, some of the subjects later reported having feared that their obvious sanity would be immediately sniffed out, causing great embarrassment on their part. They needn't have worried. All but one were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The remaining patient was admitted with a diagnosis of manic-depressive psychosis.

Upon admission, they all ceased simulating any symptoms of abnormality and reported that the voices were gone. Then, as previously instructed by Rosenhan, they waited for the staff to notice that they were not, in fact, insane. None of the staff noticed. Instead, the hospital workers interpreted the pseudopatients' behavior through the lens of insanity. When one patient was observed writing in his diary, it was noted in the nursing record that「patient engages in writing behavior,」identifying the writing as a sign of mental illness. When another patient had an outburst while being mistreated by an attendant, the behavior was also assumed to be part of the patient's pathology. Even the act of arriving at the cafeteria before it opened for lunch was seen as a symptom of insanity. Other patients, unimpressed by formal medical diagnoses, would regularly challenge the pseudopatients with comments like「You're not crazy. You're a journalist…you're checking up on the hospital.」The pseudopatients' doctors, however, wrote notes like「This white 39-year-old male…manifests a long history of considerable ambivalence in close relationships, which begins in early childhood. A warm relationship with his mother cools during adolescence. A distant relationship with his father is described as being very intense.」

The good news is that despite their suspicious habits of writing and showing up early for lunch, the pseudopatients were judged not to be a danger to themselves or others and released after an average stay of nineteen days. The hospitals never detected the ruse and, when later informed of what had gone on, denied that such a scenario could be possible.

If it is easy to fall victim to expectations, it is also easy to exploit them. That is why struggling people in Hollywood work hard to look as though they are not struggling, why doctors wear white coats and place all manner of certificates and degrees on their office walls, why used-car salesmen would rather repair blemishes on the outside of a car than sink money into engine work, and why teachers will, on average, give a higher grade to a homework assignment turned in by an「excellent」student than to identical work turned in by a「weak」one.21 Marketers also know this and design ad campaigns to create and then exploit our expectations. One arena in which that was done very effectively is the vodka market. Vodka is a neutral spirit, distilled, according to the U.S. government definition,「as to be without distinctive character, aroma, taste or color.」Most American vodkas originate, therefore, not with passionate, flannel-shirted men like those who create wines, but with corporate giants like the agrochemical supplier Archer Daniels Midland. And the job of the vodka distiller is not to nurture an aging process that imparts finely nuanced flavor but to take the 190-proof industrial swill such suppliers provide, add water, and subtract as much of the taste as possible. Through massive image-building campaigns, however, vodka producers have managed to create very strong expectations of difference. As a result, people believe that this liquor, which by its very definition is without a distinctive character, actually varies greatly from brand to brand. Moreover, they are willing to pay large amounts of money based on those differences. Lest I be dismissed as a tasteless boor, I wish to point out that there is a way to test my ravings. You could line up a series of vodkas and a series of vodka sophisticates and perform a blind tasting. As it happens, The New York Times did just that.22 And without their labels, fancy vodkas like Grey Goose and Ketel One didn't fare so well. Compared with conventional wisdom, in fact, the results appeared random. Moreover, of the twenty-one vodkas tasted, it was the cheap bar brand, Smirnoff, that came out at the top of the list. Our assessment of the world would be quite different if all our judgments could be insulated from expectation and based only on relevant data.

A FEW YEARS AGO The Sunday Times of London conducted an experiment. Its editors submitted typewritten manuscripts of the opening chapters of two novels that had won the Booker Prize — one of the world's most prestigious and most influential awards for contemporary fiction — to twenty major publishers and agents.23 One of the novels was In a Free State by V. S. Naipaul, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature; the other was Holiday by Stanley Middleton. One can safely assume that each of the recipients of the manuscripts would have heaped praise on the highly lauded novels had they known what they were reading. But the submissions were made as if they were the work of aspiring authors, and none of the publishers or agents appeared to recognize them. How did the highly successful works fare? All but one of the replies were rejections. The exception was an expression of interest in Middleton's novel by a London literary agent. The same agent wrote of Naipaul's book,「We…thought it was quite original. In the end though I'm afraid we just weren't quite enthusiastic enough to be able to offer to take things further.」

The author Stephen King unwittingly conducted a similar experiment when, worried that the public would not accept his books as quickly as he could churn them out, he wrote a series of novels under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. Sales figures indicated that even Stephen King, without the name, is no Stephen King. (Sales picked up considerably after word of the author's true identity finally got out.) Sadly, one experiment King did not perform was the opposite: to swathe wonderful unpublished manuscripts by struggling writers in covers naming him as the author. But if even Stephen King, without the name, is no Stephen King, then the rest of us, when our creative work receives a less-than-Kingly reception, might take comfort in knowing that the differences in quality might not be as great as some people would have us believe.

Years ago at Caltech, I had an office around the corner from the office of a physicist named John Schwarz. He was getting little recognition and had suffered a decade of ridicule as he almost single-handedly kept alive a discredited theory, called string theory, which predicted that space has many more dimensions than the three we observe. Then one day he and a co-worker made a technical breakthrough, and for reasons that need not concern us here, suddenly the extra dimensions sounded more acceptable. String theory has been the hottest thing in physics ever since. Today John is considered one of the brilliant elder statesmen of physics, yet had he let the years of obscurity get to him, he would have been a testament to Thomas Edison's observation that「many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.」24

Another physicist I knew had a story that was strikingly similar to John's. He was, coincidentally, John's PhD adviser at the University of California, Berkeley. Considered one of the most brilliant scientists of his generation, this physicist was a leader in an area of research called S-matrix theory. Like John, he was stubbornly persistent and continued to work on his theory for years after others had given up. But unlike John, he did not succeed. And because of his lack of success he ended his career with many people thinking him a crackpot. But in my opinion both he and John were brilliant physicists with the courage to work — with no promise of an imminent breakthrough — on a theory that had gone out of style. And just as authors should be judged by their writing and not their books' sales, so physicists — and all who strive to achieve — should be judged more by their abilities than by their success.

The cord that tethers ability to success is both loose and elastic. It is easy to see fine qualities in successful books or to see unpublished manuscripts, inexpensive vodkas, or people struggling in any field as somehow lacking. It is easy to believe that ideas that worked were good ideas, that plans that succeeded were well designed, and that ideas and plans that did not were ill conceived. And it is easy to make heroes out of the most successful and to glance with disdain at the least. But ability does not guarantee achievement, nor is achievement proportional to ability. And so it is important to always keep in mind the other term in the equation — the role of chance.

It is no tragedy to think of the most successful people in any field as superheroes. But it is a tragedy when a belief in the judgment of experts or the marketplace rather than a belief in ourselves causes us to give up, as John Kennedy Toole did when he committed suicide after publishers repeatedly rejected his manuscript for the posthumously best-selling Confederacy of Dunces. And so when tempted to judge someone by his or her degree of success, I like to remind myself that were they to start over, Stephen King might be only a Richard Bachman and V. S. Naipaul just another struggling author, and somewhere out there roam the equals of Bill Gates and Bruce Willis and Roger Maris who are not rich and famous, equals on whom Fortune did not bestow the right breakthrough product or TV show or year. What I've learned, above all, is to keep marching forward because the best news is that since chance does play a role, one important factor in success is under our control: the number of at bats, the number of chances taken, the number of opportunities seized. For even a coin weighted toward failure will sometimes land on success. Or as the IBM pioneer Thomas Watson said,「If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.」

I have tried in this book to present the basic concepts of randomness, to illustrate how they apply to human affairs, and to present my view that its effects are largely overlooked in our interpretations of events and in our expectations and decisions. It may come as an epiphany merely to recognize the ubiquitous role of random processes in our lives; the true power of the theory of random processes, however, lies in the fact that once we understand the nature of random processes, we can alter the way we perceive the events that happen around us.

The psychologist David Rosenhan wrote that「once a person is abnormal, all of his other behaviors and characteristics are colored by that label.」25 The same applies for stardom, for many other labels of success, and for those of failure. We judge people and initiatives by their results, and we expect events to happen for good, understandable reasons. But our clear visions of inevitability are often only illusions. I wrote this book in the belief that we can reorganize our thinking in the face of uncertainty. We can improve our skill at decision making and tame some of the biases that lead us to make poor judgments and poor choices. We can seek to understand people's qualities or the qualities of a situation quite apart from the results they attain, and we can learn to judge decisions by the spectrum of potential outcomes they might have produced rather than by the particular result that actually occurred.

My mother always warned me not to think I could predict or control the future. She once related the incident that converted her to that belief. It concerned her sister, Sabina, of whom she still often speaks although it has been over sixty-five years since she last saw her. Sabina was seventeen. My mother, who idolized her as younger siblings sometimes do their older siblings, was fifteen. The Nazis had invaded Poland, and my father, from the poor section of town, had joined the underground and, as I said earlier, eventually ended up in Buchenwald. My mother, who didn't know him then, came from the wealthy part of town and ended up in a forced-labor camp. There she was given the job of nurse's aide and took care of patients suffering from typhus. Food was scarce, and random death was always near. To help protect my mother from the ever-present dangers, Sabina agreed to a plan. She had a friend who was a member of the Jewish police, a group, generally despised by the inmates, who carried out the Germans' commands and helped keep order in the camp. Sabina's friend had offered to marry her — a marriage in name only — so that Sabina might obtain the protections that his position afforded. Sabina, thinking those protections would extend to my mother, agreed. For a while it worked. Then something happened, and the Nazis soured on the Jewish police. They sent a number of officers to the gas chambers, along with their spouses — including Sabina's husband and Sabina herself. My mother has lived now for many more years without Sabina than she had lived with her, but Sabina's death still haunts her. My mother worries that when she is gone, there will no longer be any trace that Sabina ever existed. To her this story shows that it is pointless to make plans. I do not agree. I believe it is important to plan, if we do so with our eyes open. But more important, my mother's experience has taught me that we ought to identify and appreciate the good luck that we have and recognize the random events that contribute to our success. It has taught me, too, to accept the chance events that may cause us grief. Most of all it has taught me to appreciate the absence of bad luck, the absence of events that might have brought us down, and the absence of the disease, war, famine, and accident that have not — or have not yet — befallen us.

1001醉汉的脚步

1814 年，牛顿物理学差不多正处于成功的巅峰。在这一年，拉普拉斯写道：

假如一个智能体，在一个给定的时刻，知道了所有使世界运行的力，以及世界的每一个组成体的位置；进一步地，如果该智能体足够强大，以至能对这些数据进行分析，它就可以用同一个方程将宇宙中最大之天体及最小之原子的运动皆囊括其中：对于这个智能体而言，没有什么是不确定的，而未来就如同过去一样，呈现在它的眼前。

拉普拉斯表达的这种观点叫「决定论」：世界的当前状态，精确地决定了它未来的发展方向。

如果将决定论应用到我们的日常生活中，那么它意味着我们将生活在这样一个世界，在这个世界上，个人的素质以及任何形势或环境的性质，都将以直接而毫不含糊的方式导致精准的后果。这是一个有序的世界，其中的任何事情都能被预见，并能通过计算求得。但拉普拉斯的梦想要成真，必须满足几个条件。首先，自然定律本身必须能够给出一个确定的未来，而且我们必须掌握这些定律。其次，我们必须获得那些完全描述了我们感兴趣的系统的数据，而且不允许有任何不可预见的因素。最后，我们必须有足够的智慧或计算能力，能根据已知的数据描述现在的数据，能通过定律计算它所确定的未来是何等模样。在本书中，我们已经审视了许多有助于理解随机现象的概念。一路走来，我们已经对生活中的许多具体情境有了深入的了解。然而，我们还需要看到事物的全貌，也就是随机性到底在多大程度上造就了我们在生命中所处的位置，而当我们去预测前进的方向时，我们的预测又能做到多好？

从文艺复兴晚期到维多利亚时代，许多学者在对人类社会进行的研究中抱持着与拉普拉斯相同的决定论信念。他们或者像高尔顿那样认为人的生命历程是由个人素质严格确定的，或者像凯特勒那样相信社会的未来是可以预测的。牛顿物理学的成功，使他们相信人类行为是能够被可靠预言的，就像其他自然现象能够被预言一样。在他们看来，日常世界的未来就像行星的轨道，应当能够由当前的事件状态严格确定，这一点似乎再合理不过了。

20 世纪 60 年代，一位名叫爱德华·洛伦兹的气象学家，想利用当时的最新科技，也就是一台原始计算机，在气象研究这个有限的领域内实践一下拉普拉斯的观念。根据拉普拉斯相信的决定论世界观，如果洛伦兹将他那个理想地球在某个特定时刻的大气状况数据，输入一台噪声不断的计算机，计算机就会利用已知的气象学定律，计算和打印出一行行表示未来天气状况的数字。

一天，洛伦兹决定将手头这个特定的模拟扩展到未来，他打算偷懒抄条近路，因此没有完整重复计算过程，而是把运行到一半时的结果作为初始条件，开始运行新的模拟。于是他把之前打印出来的中间模拟结果作为新模拟的初始数据，送进计算机的输入设备，并期望计算机再度出现之前模拟结果的剩余部分，并进一步求出更加遥远的未来的模拟结果。但和他预期的情况不同，他注意到一件很奇怪的事情：新模拟中的天气演化，与旧模拟的结果完全不同。新模拟没能重复旧模拟在剩余时间段内的结果，反而严重偏离了该结果。很快，他就意识到造成这一偏离的原因：在计算机内存中，数据的存储精度是小数点后六位，而打印出的结果，只保留到小数点后三位。这样一来，他用作新模拟初始条件的数据，就与旧模拟的相应数据存在着微小的差别。例如，0.293416 这个值被打印出来时，就变成了 0.293。

科学家通常都会假设，如果某系统的初始条件发生了很小的变化，那么系统的演化过程同样只会发生很小的变化。不管怎样，收集天气数据的卫星在测量各种参数时，也只能达到小数点后两位或三位的精度，因此它们不可能发觉 0.293416 和 0.293 之间那细微的差别。但洛伦兹发现，这微小的差别可以导致结果的巨大改变。这种现象被称为「蝴蝶效应」，其名称的来由，是指一只蝴蝶扇动翅膀所造成的大气状况的些微改变，可能会在之后的全球天气模式中造成巨大影响。这个观点听起来十分荒谬。这不就等于说某天早上你多喝了一杯咖啡，也将对你的生活产生深远的影响吗？但事实上，这种事的确会发生。比如这额外的时间使你在火车站与未来的妻子偶遇，或者使你刚好避开一辆加速闯红灯的汽车。实际上，洛伦兹的故事本身，就是蝴蝶效应的一个例子：要不是他决定用这种抄小路的方式延长模拟时间，他就不会发现将带来一个全新的数学领域的蝴蝶效应。在回顾生命中那些重大事件的细节时，我们不难发现这类看似无足轻重却导致巨大改变的随机事件的存在。

1-3『洛伦兹的这个例子记得在书籍「复杂」里看到过，「混沌」系统往往符合蝴蝶效应。（2021-03-01）』

与人类自身和人类社会有关的决定论，无法满足那些拉普拉斯暗指的可预测性所需的条件。之所以如此，原因有以下几点。首先，就目前所知，人类社会不像物理学那样，由明确而基本的定律主宰。恰恰相反，人类的行为正如卡尼曼和特沃斯基一再证明的那样，不仅无法预测，而且（从行为违背自身最大利益的意义上来说）常常是非理性的。其次，即使我们能够像凯特勒所希望的那样，发现主宰人类活动的定律，我们也不可能精确获知或控制生活中的各种因素。也就是说，我们跟洛伦兹一样，无法得到预测所需的精确数据。第三，与人有关的事情是如此复杂，因此，哪怕我们真的了解了这些定律，获取了这些数据，能否完成必要的计算也是存疑的。因此，决定论对于人类活动而言，是一个很糟糕的模型。或者按诺贝尔奖获得者马克斯·玻恩的话来说：「相比于因果性，偶然性是一个更加基本的概念。」

醉汉的脚步是随机过程的科学研究中所使用的一个基本模型。不过它同样为我们的日常生活提供了合适的模型，因为就像悬浮在布朗流体中的花粉微粒那样，我们也不断地被随机事件推动，先是走向这个方向，然后又通往那个方向。虽然我们在社会学数据中可以发现统计规律，但是对于某个具体的个人而言，未来仍然是无法预测的。对于某个具体的成就、工作、朋友或财政状况等，机遇所占的功劳比许多人能认识到的还要大。接下来，我将进一步说明，现实生活中除了一些最简单的情势，我们都无法躲开那些不可预见或无法预测的力量。正是这些随机力量的影响，以及我们对它们做出的反应，塑造了我们大部分的生命之路。不过作为一个开头，我会探讨一个明显与上述观点相矛盾的问题：如果未来果真一片混沌而无法预测，那么为什么有很多事情，我们在事后回顾时，却常常觉得这些后果好像是应该可以预见的？

1941 年秋，在日本人袭击珍珠港的几个月前，东京的情报机关给在檀香山的间谍发去一个令人不安的命令。美军截获了这个命令，并把它送到海军情报局。在官僚作风满满的处理程序之后，已解密和翻译好的情报于 10 月 9 日被送抵华盛顿。这个命令要求檀香山的日本情报人员将珍珠港划分为 5 个区域，并按区域报告在港舰艇，特别是战列舰、驱逐舰与航空母舰以及同一船坞停靠多艘舰船的情况。几周后，另一件古怪的事情发生了：美国的监听人员无法跟踪到日军第一、第二舰队所有已知航母的无线电通信，对它们的位置也一无所知。然后在 12 月初，位于夏威夷的第 14 海军辖区战斗情报单位报告，日本人在一个月内第二次更改了舰艇呼号。如 WCBS 或 KNPR 这样的呼号是用来标识无线电通信源的，在战争时期，它们不但能使友方，也能使敌方发现舰只的身份，因此这些呼号总是被周期性地更换。日军的习惯是每 6 个月或更长时间更换一次呼号，而在 30 天中更换两次呼号，就被视作「大规模主动行动准备工作中的一个步骤」。这一改变使得接下来的几天确认日军航母和潜艇的位置变得更加困难，也让之前的无线电静默变得更令人困惑。

两天后，发送到日本驻香港、新加坡、巴达维亚、马尼拉、华盛顿和伦敦外交与领事机构的密电被截获并破解。这些消息要求外交官们立即销毁密码本，并烧掉其他所有重要的机密与秘密文件。同时，FBI 也截获到一个由日本驻夏威夷领事馆的厨师打给身在檀香山的某人的电话，厨师兴奋地告诉对方，官员们正在烧毁所有重要文件。陆军情报部门主管助理比克内尔中校带着一份截获的消息，来到当时正准备与陆军夏威夷部负责人共进晚餐的顶头上司面前。这时已是 12 月 6 日星期六，即攻击前一天的下午接近傍晚的时候了。这些事后看来如此有预示性的事情，为何未能让那些与此事利益攸关的人意识到敌军的进攻正在逼近呢？

在一个复杂的事件链条中，每个事件的发展都带有一定的不确定性。因此，一种根本的不对称性就存在于过去与未来之间。自从玻尔兹曼决定对流体性质的分子过程进行统计分析（见第 8 章）以来，这种不对称性就一直是科学研究的对象。设想浮在一杯水中的一个染料分子。这个分子将如同布朗的花粉微粒那样，迈着醉汉的步伐前进。但即使是这种无目的性的运动，也会产生某个方向上的位移。如果等上比如 3 小时，这个分子通常将离开其最初位置约 1 英寸。假设在某个时间点上，分子移动到某个显眼的位置，并最终吸引了我们的注意，那么正如许多人在珍珠港事件之后所做的那样，我们可能会去寻找这个出乎意料的事件的成因。现在假定我们能够深挖这个分子的历史，跟踪其所有的碰撞记录，那么我们的确可以发现，这个或那个水分子的碰撞，推动着染料分子沿着它那曲曲折折的道路前进。换句话说，我们在事后可以清楚地解释，为什么这个染料分子的过去是以这种确定的方式发展的。但水中还有许多其他的水分子，它们也有可能与染料分子相互作用。要在实际发生之前预测染料分子的路线，需要计算所有那些具有潜在重要性的水分子的路线和它们的相互作用，而这需要几乎无法想象的巨大的计算量。相较于解释过去所需要的那张碰撞清单，预测的计算规模和难度要高出许多。因此，要在实际发生前预测染料分子的运动，几乎是不可能的，哪怕这个运动相对而言在事后更容易解释一些。

我们总是能在日常生活中发现许多看似十分明显，事先却无法预测的事情，这种根本的不对称性就是原因。所以天气预报员能告诉你，因为三天前冷空气前锋这么运动而昨天暖空气前锋那么移动，所以你那浪漫的室外婚礼就碰到了下雨天。但如果要事先了解这些冷暖空气在今后三天是如何运动的，并提醒你为婚礼准备一顶大帐篷，这位天气预报员所做的就远不如前者成功了。我们再来看看国际象棋比赛。与纸牌不同，国际象棋中并没有直接的随机因素，但其中同样存在不确定性，因为比赛双方都不能确定地知道，对手的下一步将怎么走。如果双方都是高手，那么在大多数的回合中，他们还有可能预见接下来的几步棋会怎么走，但是如果再多想几步，不确定性就会掺和进来，让棋局的发展变得无法预测。但另一方面，我们通常能够很容易在事后指出每名棋手走出每步棋的原因。国际象棋同样是一个过往易懂但未来难测的随机过程。

上述情况在股票市场中也一样。比如基金的业绩表现。如第 9 章提到的，选择基金时，我们常常会参考它们之前的表现。确实，在之前的表现中，我们可以轻易地发现干脆又漂亮的模式。例如，图 10-1 就绘出了 800 名基金经理在 1991 年到 1995 年 5 年间的表现。

![](./res/2020004.png)

图 10-1 1991-1995 年，最佳基金的业绩排名图

纵轴标出的是各基金相对于所有基金平均收益的盈亏，换言之，收益为 0 表示该基金的业绩与所有基金 5 年间的平均业绩持平。横轴标出的则是基金经理的相对排名，从第 1 名到第 800 名。如果我们要看看这 5 年中排名第 100 的基金经理的业绩，那么在横轴为 100 的地方能读到这个数据。

毫无疑问，任何分析家都能找到一系列令人信服的理由，说明图中那些业绩领先的经理为何会成功，垫底的经理为何会失败，曲线为什么就该是这个样子。不管投资者会不会花时间去了解这些分析的细节，他们都不会选一只过去 5 年的业绩比平均水平低 10% 的基金，而肯定会选一只比平均水平高 10% 的基金。回顾过去，我们能轻易构造出这样漂亮的图形和直截了当的解释。但这个再符合逻辑不过的图，却不过是马后炮造成的错觉，它与预测未来几乎扯不上什么关系。在图 10-2 中，我将同样的基金再次进行了比较，其中横轴仍然按之前 5 年的排名排列，而纵轴表示它们在接下来 5 年中的业绩。也就是说，我保持了 1991-1995 年的排名，但显示了基金在 1996-2000 年实现的收益。如果过去的表现可以很好地预测未来，那么这些基金在 1991-1995 年以及 1996-2000 年，其相对业绩多少应该表现出一些一致性。也就是说，如果赢家（图的左边）依旧比别人干得好，而输家（图的右边）依旧干得很差，那么这张图应该与上一张图差不多完全相同。但正如该图所示，当我们把过去的那个秩序外推到将来时，这个秩序就解体了，而新图形看起来跟随机噪声差不多。

偶然性在投资以及如股权基金经理米勒这类人在成功中所扮演的角色，被人们以一种系统性的方式遗漏了，与此同时，我们却总是毫无根据地相信，过去的错误必定是无知或无能的结果，而我们只要多多学习，提高我们的洞察力，就可以纠正这一点。这也是为什么在 2007 年的春天，当美林证券的股价在 95 美元左右时，它的首席执行官奥尼尔被认为是个冒险的天才，而到了 2007 年秋天证券市场崩溃后，他就被嘲笑为不计后果的鲁莽牛仔，并很快被炒了鱿鱼。我们条件反射式地对商业显贵、政治家与演员中的超级巨星以及任何坐着私人飞机飞来飞去的家伙表示尊敬，好像他们的成就是他们身上的什么特有素质的必然反映，而那些不得不吞下经济舱飞行餐的人是不会拥有这样的素质的。政治领域的专家、金融专家和商业顾问这类人，他们总是声称以往的记录就代表着专业水平，而我们对他们做出的精确过头的预测，投入的信心也是过头了。

我熟知的一家大型出版公司，有一次要给它的教育软件部制订一年、三年与五年计划。在这个过程中，它碰到了相当棘手的问题。公司有高薪聘请的顾问，有冗长的市场调研会议，有熬夜进行的金融分析讨论会，还有长时间在外召开的午后会议。终于，所有人的种种预感被写成公式，公式算出了结果，这些结果则精确到小数点后好几位，而公司疯狂的猜想现在也变成了实现的可能性比较大的预期。在计划执行的第一年里，如果某些产品卖得不及预期，或者另一些产品卖得比预期要好，那么大家总是能找到之所以好或不好的理由，并归功或归咎于相应人等，好像那些预期真有什么意义似的。到了第二年，市场上的两个竞争对手发起了一系列该公司未预见的价格战。再过一年，教育软件市场彻底崩溃了。当不确定因素插手到计划实施中时，那个三年计划其实根本没有成功的机会。至于那个被精雕细琢打磨得有如钻石的五年计划则更走运些，没有人会麻烦它出来与实际结果进行任何比较，因为五年之后，那个部门差不多所有人都跳了槽。

对于本身的专业就是研究过去的历史学家来说，他们对于事件是遵循可预测的方式发展的观点，也抱持着与科学家同样的警惕态度。实际上，必然性错觉在历史研究中有着严重的后果，而对于必然性错觉的态度，也成为保守的历史学家与社会主义历史学家达成共识的少数事情之一。例如社会主义历史学家托尼就说过：「历史学家们给出了一种必然性的说法…… 把获胜的力量推到显赫的地位上，把那些被它们吞噬的力量扔到角落里。」而曾被里根授予总统自由勋章的历史学家沃尔斯泰特则这样说：「当然，各种信号在事后看来，总是非常清晰；我们可以看到它预示的究竟是怎样的灾难…… 但在事前，它却晦涩朦胧，并有着相互矛盾的含义。」

从某种意义上说，世事难料的观念从来都被包装在「事后诸葛亮」这样的俗语中，但人们实际的行为表现，却又好像在说这句话根本是错的。在每个悲剧发生之后，「你们早该知道它会发生」这样的问责游戏就会在政府上演。在珍珠港（以及 9·11 恐怖袭击事件）的例子中，当我们回过头看那些攻击前所发生的事情，它们似乎都指向一个显然的方向。但正如在染料分子、天气与国际象棋的例子中那样，如果我们在事前跟踪局势的发展，这种必然感很快就消失无踪了。首先，除了我提到的那些情报，还有海量的无用情报。这类新情报或新报告，一周下来都堆成山了。这些消息有时候好像是一种警讯，有时候又充满神秘感，不过后来都被证明具有误导性或毫无重要性。即使我们将注意力集中在事后证明是重要的报告上，在袭击发生前，每份这样的报告也都存在着不同的合理解释，并不能说明针对珍珠港的偷袭已经在进行了。例如，那个将珍珠港分为 5 个区域的命令，与其他被发往驻巴拿马、温哥华、旧金山和俄勒冈州波特兰的日本情报人员手中的命令，都是相似的。至于失去无线电监测也并非前所未有的事，这种情况过去常常意味着战舰正停泊在本土港口，因此它们之间的通信是利用陆上电缆收发电报进行的。更重要的是，即使相信战争的扩大已经迫在眉睫，却有许多信息表明袭击会发生在别处 —— 例如菲律宾群岛、马来半岛或关岛。在珍珠港的例子中，让我们的注意力发生偏向的因素，其数量肯定没有染料分子所碰到的水分子多，但已足够使未来的清晰图景变得模糊不清。

在珍珠港事件之后，美国国会的 7 个委员会开始不断钻研，以求发现军方忽略所有那些表明攻击即将到来的「信号」的原因。作为军方一员的陆军参谋长马歇尔，因为一份 1941 年 5 月致罗斯福总统的备忘录而招致强烈的批评。该备忘录称「由于其防御工事、驻军以及自然条件，我们相信瓦胡岛是世界上最为坚固的堡垒」，并再次使总统确信，如果敌人来袭，敌方将「在距目标 200 英里的范围内…… 被各式各样的弹雨」阻截。马歇尔将军不是笨蛋，不过他手上当然也没有能够预测未来的水晶球。随机性研究告诉我们，如水晶球般清澈的事件场景是可能出现的，但不幸的是，这种场景只会在事后出现。因此，我们相信我们知道一部影片表现不错，一名候选人赢得了选举，一场风暴即将来袭，一只股票价格下跌，一支足球队输了比赛，一种新产品在市场上大败，或者一种疾病开始恶化等种种事情的成因。可一旦面临预测一部影片是否会表现不错，一名候选人是否会赢得选举，一场风暴是否会来袭，一只股票价格是否会下跌，一支足球队是否会输掉比赛，一种新产品是否会在市场上遭遇失败或一种疾病是否会恶化等问题时，我们的这种能力几乎无能为力。就预测而言，这个所谓能力实际上什么都不是。

我们当然可以很容易地编出故事来解释过去，或者让自己对不确定的未来发展充满信心。我们也用不着因为这些做法存在陷阱，就把它们彻底扔到一边。不过，我们可以努力增强自己对直觉式错误的免疫力。我们可以学会用怀疑的眼光看待解释和预言；我们可以更注重对事件做出反应的素质，如灵活性、信心、勇气与坚毅等品质，而不是依赖于对事件是否发生的预测能力；我们可以更看重直接的第一印象，而非那些被大肆宣扬的当年之勇。通过这些途径，我们可以避免在机械决定论的框架内形成我们的判断。

1979 年 3 月，还发生了一连串事件，其中的种种出乎意料地让这一连串事件名声大噪。这回的事情发生在宾夕法尼亚州的一个核电站中。事情的结局是核反应堆的堆芯部分熔毁，并有可能向周边环境释放出超警戒水平剂量的辐射。灾难是这样开始的：有大约一杯左右的水，在一个被称为精处理器的水过滤器中，从密封处渗漏出来，并流入驱动电厂某些仪器的一个气动系统，这导致两个阀门出现故障。这些出故障的阀门切断了电厂蒸汽发电机组的冷水供应 —— 而该蒸汽发电机组正是负责带走核反应堆堆芯处所产生的热量的系统。之后紧急水泵启动，它的两路管道上各有一个阀门，但在两天前的维修工作结束之后，它们仍然被设置在关闭状态。因此，水泵只是徒劳地将水打进死胡同。此外，某个减压阀门未能正常工作，而控制室里本应显示该阀门状态的仪表同时发生了故障。

如果我们现在单独看这些故障中的任何一个，会发现它们其实都属于常见也可以接受的情况。精处理器故障在这个电厂不是什么稀罕事，通常也不是什么大问题；核电站中有成百的阀门有规律地打开和关闭，其中一些被设置在错误的状态，这既不罕见，也不值得担心太多；而那个减压阀的不可靠，本来就是大家都知道的事，而且，至少这一款减压阀在 11 个其他电站中也不时发生故障，却没有造成严重后果。不过所有这些故障凑到一起，整个电站就像是由启斯东警察在打理一样。因此，紧随三英里岛上这场事故发生的，就是众多的调查和非难，以及一个完全不同类型的后果。耶鲁大学的社会学家查尔斯·佩罗受到引起事故的那一连串事件的启发，建立了一个新的意外事故的理论，其中就给出了本章的中心论点：我们应当能够预料到，复杂系统（我将生活也算在内）中那些通常被忽略不计的次要因素，会由于偶然性，而在某些时候导致重大事件的发生。

佩罗认识到现代系统都是由数以千计的部分组成的，其中还包括可能出错的人类决策者。这些组成部分相互联系在一起，但这些联系如同拉普拉斯的原子那样无法被单独跟踪和预测。但我愿意打赌，正如那迈着醉汉步伐行走的原子最终将到达某个位置一样，事故也将不可避免地发生。佩罗这个被称为「事故常态理论」的学说，描述了事故是如何发生的，哪怕事故看起来并没有明确的原因，也没有公司或政府调查组织所希望找到的明显的错误和为之负责的无能的笨蛋。尽管事故常态理论研究的是事情有时必然出错的原因，但它同样能反过来解释为什么事情有时必然成功。因为在复杂的过程中，不管失败了多少次，如果我们一直尝试，那么最终成功的机会还是不小的。实际上，W. 布莱恩·阿瑟这样的经济学家就认为，许多次要因素的同时发生，甚至可以使没有特别优势的公司压倒竞争对手。「在现实世界中，」他写道，「如果几个规模相近的公司一同进入市场，那么，小小的偶然事件，比如意外的订单、与消费者偶然的碰面、管理上的突发奇想等等，将决定哪些公司能更早获得销售收入，并通过日积月累，最终成为市场的支配力量。经济活动…… 由单独的业务决定，这些业务小到无法预见。但这些小小的‘随机’事件能（积累）堆积起来，并随着时间的流逝，以正反馈的方式得到放大。」

社会学研究者也留意到同样的现象。比如，一群研究者对被社会学家称为文化产业的书籍、电影、艺术、音乐等领域的消费者购买习惯展开了研究。这些领域的传统市场营销思路认为，我们应当预测消费者的喜好，这样就可以获得成功。如果按照这种观点，管理者最有成效的时间使用方式，就应该是去研究斯蒂芬·金、麦当娜或布鲁斯·威利斯到底为什么能够让他们的粉丝如此着迷。他们研究了过去，然后跟我说的一样，他们没费什么力气就找出成功的原因，不论他们认为的这个成功到底是什么。之后，他们希望能复制这些成功。

这就是市场中的决定论，在这种观念下，成功主要取决于某人或某产品的内在品质。但我们还能以另一种非决定论的方式看待成功。以非决定论的观点来看，世界上还有许多高质量但不为人知的书籍、歌手和演员，而真正能让这一个或那一个出头的，很大程度上是随机性与各种次要因素合谋的结果，也就是运气。根据这种观点，那些具有传统观念的行政管理人员不过是在玩轮盘赌。

多亏了互联网，这个观点已经得到验证。研究者将注意力放在销售额主要来自互联网的音乐市场。为了开展研究，他们雇用了 14341 名参与者，让他们听一些他们从未听说过的乐队演唱的 48 首歌曲，并给它们打分，如果他们愿意的话，还可以下载这些歌曲。有些参与者能够看到这些歌曲的流行程度的数据，也就是有多少参与者下载了这些歌曲。这些参与者被分到 8 个相互隔离的「世界」中，并且只能看到同一世界中的参与者下载歌曲的情况。每个乐队在每个世界中的初始下载量都为 0，之后各个世界独立演变。此外还有一个第 9 组，其中的参与者看不到任何数据。研究者用这最后一组相互隔绝的参与者给出的歌曲流行度，来定义每首歌的「固有质量」，也就是在没有外界影响的情况下，这些歌曲所具有的吸引力。

如果决定论的世界观是正确，那么在前 8 个世界中占优势的，应该是相同的歌曲，而且这 8 个世界中的歌曲排行，应该与第 9 组的孤立参与者给出的固有质量一致。但研究者发现的结果恰好相反：各首歌曲在不同世界中的受欢迎程度天差地别，而固有质量相近的不同歌曲，其受欢迎程度也相差悬殊。比如，52metro 乐队演唱的「Lockdown」，其固有质量在 48 首歌中排名第 26，但在一个世界中，它的排名为第一，而在另一个世界中，排名为第 40。在实验中，如果某首歌曲偶然地在早期获得了较多下载量，那么这首歌曲颇受欢迎的表象，会进一步影响后来的购买者。这种现象在电影产业中也广为人知：电影观众如果事前听说某部电影不错，他们通常就会表现出更多的喜好。在这个例子中，小小的随机影响产生了滚雪球效应，使歌曲的未来天差地别。我们又一次看到了蝴蝶效应。

在生活中细致观察，我们同样可以发现，如果没有那些偶遇的人、偶然到来的工作机会以及各种各样小因素的随机会合，许多重大事件的结果可能会完全不同。让我们想象一下这样一位演员，他从 20 世纪 70 年代后期开始的 7 年中，一直住在曼哈顿 59 大街一幢没有电梯的公寓的 6 楼，为着有朝一日能闯出名头而努力着。他干着些既不在百老汇也没办法进入百老汇的戏剧工作，这些工作有时离百老汇还很远。他还出演电视广告节目。总之，他用尽浑身解数希望引起别人的注意，全力打造自己的职业生涯，并赚到足够的钱能偶尔到饭店享用一餐烤牛排，而不必为了逃单偷偷摸摸地溜走。但如同许多赶超偶像的人一样，不管这名志向远大的演员怎样努力挑选恰当的角色，选择正确的交易，并尽可能地突出表现自己，他最可靠的角色，却还是酒吧招待。后来，在 1984 年夏天的某个日子，他飞到洛杉矶。他去洛杉矶的目的，要么是去观看奥林匹克运动会（如果你相信他的评传作家），要么是去拜访一位女性朋友（如果你相信《纽约时报》）。但不管哪个才是实情，有一件事却是非常明确的：拜访西海岸的这个决定，跟演出没什么关系，跟爱情（至少是对体育的热爱）倒是颇有瓜葛。但后来发生的事情证明，这是他职业生涯中做出的最好的决策，而且还很可能是他这辈子做过的最好的决定。

这个演员名叫布鲁斯·威利斯。在洛杉矶时，一名星探建议他去参加一些电视剧试演 ，其中一个试演节目已经进入最后选角的阶段。制作方当时其实已经有了一个最终入围者的名单，但是，好莱坞可没有「最终」这回事，除非是合同上的墨迹都干透了，官司也已经盖棺定论了。威利斯得到试演机会，并最终获得大卫·艾迪森这个角色 ——ABC（美国广播公司）的新节目《蓝色月光侦探社》中斯碧尔·谢波德的男搭档。

我们可能很容易想到，这一定是因为威利斯比本来排名榜首的那位 X 先生更适合这个角色。至于接下来的事情（用别人的话来说）就是历史了。我们现在当然知道《蓝色月光侦探社》和威利斯都取得了巨大成功，所以好莱坞那帮拍板的家伙在第一眼看到威利斯的时候，除了赶紧烧掉笨头笨脑的长靴来庆祝新发现的耀眼新星，并把那张现在已经被否定的最终入围者名单扔到火里，我们很难想象他们还能做些什么别的事情。不过在演员选角阶段实际发生的事情，倒更像是你让孩子们出去买 1 加仑 冰激凌，结果两个想要草莓味，第三个却想要三层巧克力法奇方块蛋糕味时的那种情形。电视台的管理人员为 X 先生而战，他们觉得威利斯看起来并不像一个严肃的主持人。《蓝色月光侦探社》的制作总监格伦·卡伦则支持威利斯。前者在事后很容易被看作无知的小丑。就我的经验而言，电视节目制作人常常都持这种意见，当这些评论不会被搞管理的人听到时更是如此。但在你认可这个想法之前，请考虑一下下面的问题：电视观众在开始时都认同管理人员的评价，他们也觉得威利斯不过是个普普通通的演员而已。《蓝色月光侦探社》于 1985 年 3 月初次亮相时，收视率很低。在整个第一季中，其表现只能说是平庸而已。只是到了第二季，观众才改变了想法，然后节目大红大紫。在威利斯突然成为一线明星之前，我们理所当然无法预见他的魅力和成功。人们现在也许会把这笔账记在疯狂的好莱坞头上，但威利斯那条通往成功的醉汉之路，却根本不是什么不寻常的事情。许多成功人士走过的，正是这样一条被众多随机影响及意料之外的结果隔成一段一段的道路。不仅他们的职业生涯是这样，他们的爱情、嗜好及友谊也是如此。实际上，这种情况更像是规律而非例外。

我最近一次看午夜节目时，在一个访谈中看到另一位明星，虽然他并非娱乐圈中人。他的名字叫比尔·盖茨。访谈节目的主持人向来以嘲讽的风格著称，但面对盖茨，他却表现出颇不寻常的恭敬，甚至连下面的听众似乎也在对盖茨大抛媚眼。之所以如此，当然是因为盖茨已连续 13 年被《福布斯》杂志评为全世界最富有的人。实际上，自创立微软公司以来，盖茨每秒钟都能赚 100 多美元。因此，当他被问及对互动电视的看法时，每个人都怀着极大的期待等待着他的演讲。但他的回答十分平庸，并不比其他一打计算机专家嘴中说出的回答更富有创意，更为独特或更具洞察力。这不禁使我们思忖：到底是因为盖茨像神一样，所以才能每秒钟赚 100 美元，还是因为他每秒钟能赚 100 美元所以才像神一样？

1980 年，一群从事某个秘密的个人计算机制造项目的 IBM（国际商业机器公司）员工，因为这个项目飞到西雅图，与这位年轻的计算机企业家见面。盖茨当时创建了一家小公司，而 IBM 需要为计划中的「家庭计算机」寻找一个被称为「操作系统」的程序。对后来发生的事情，各方的回忆有所不同，但大体上是这样的 ：盖茨说他无法提供这个操作系统，并建议 IBM 的人去找一位著名的软件程序员，数字研究公司（DRI）的加里·基尔代尔。IBM 与基尔代尔之间的商谈并不顺利。原因之一是当 IBM 的人来到数字研究公司的办公室时，基尔代尔当时的妻子也是公司的业务经理，拒绝与 IBM 签署保密协议。IBM 的使者们再次造访，而这一次，基尔代尔与他们见了面。没有人确切知道在这次会面中发生了什么，但即使在这次会谈中他们达成了一笔非正式的交易，交易后来也没能继续下去。大约在这时，IBM 的杰克·萨姆斯又碰到了盖茨。两人当时都知道，还有另一个能用的操作系统，它是基于基尔代尔的系统，或是在基尔代尔系统的启发之下做出来的，至于到底是哪一个，就看你愿意相信谁了。据萨姆斯所述，当时盖茨说道：「你想去弄……（那个操作系统）呢，还是想要我帮你弄到手？」萨姆斯显然不想被牵连在内，因此他说：「不管用什么方法，你去搞到它就成。」盖茨做到了，代价是 5 万美元（或根据某些记述，还要再多一点点），他对这个系统做了一些改动，并给它重新起了个名字叫 DOS（磁盘操作系统）。IBM 显然对自己那个家庭计算机的新点子的潜力心里没底，因此它以低廉的软件拷贝使用费，从盖茨那儿获得了使用许可，而盖茨保留了版权。DOS 并不比苹果公司的 Macintosh 这样的操作系统更好，而且还有很多人，包括大多数计算机专业人士说它比后者差很多。但增长中的 IBM 用户群，鼓励了软件开发者为 DOS 编制程序，从而刺激了潜在用户购买 IBM 的机器，反过来又激励了软件开发人员为 DOS 编制程序。换言之，正如阿瑟说的那样，人们之所以购买 IBM 的机器，是因为人们都在购买 IBM 的机器。在计算机企业界这个流体中，盖茨成为脱颖而出的那个分子。但要不是基尔代尔的不合作，IBM 的缺乏远见，以及萨姆斯与盖茨的再度会面，那么不管盖茨有多少先见之明或商业敏感性，他可能都只会成为另一个软件企业家，而不是世界上最富有的人之一。而他关于互动电视的观点不过是又一个软件企业家的观点，原因就在于此。

我们的社会能很快将富人变成英雄，把穷人变成山羊。这就是为什么房地产大亨唐纳德·特朗普在他的广场酒店破产而赌场帝国破产两次（如果有合作伙伴在 1994 年向他的赌博公司投资 1 万美元的话，13 年后，他只能揣着剩下的 636 美元离开） 之后，仍然敢于在一个颇为成功的电视节目中以明星的面目出现，并对那些怀有雄心壮志的年轻人的商业智慧评头论足。

按照与其财富成比例的方式评价人们的才智，显然很可能是个错误。我们无法看到某人的潜能，而只能看到这些潜能所带来的结果，因此我们常常认为结果必然体现能力，并因此对这个人形成错误的判断。生活的事故常态理论却证明，行动和收获之间的联系虽然并非完全随机，但随机因素的影响，却与我们本身的素质及行动同等重要。

许多人在情感上不愿意接受随机影响非常重要这个看法，哪怕他们在理智上认识到这确实就是事实。如果人们低估了机遇在那些巨头的职业生涯中所扮演的角色，那么对于机遇在最为失败的那些人的生活中所扮演的角色，我们是否同样没有给予足够的重视呢？在这个问题的推动下，社会心理学家梅尔文·勒纳在 20 世纪 60 年代考察了社会对穷人所持的负面态度。勒纳认识到，「如果人们相信在其作为和收获之间存在某种随机联系的话，就没有多少人会付出长期的努力」，因此他的结论就是，「为了让自己还保有理智」，人们高估了由成功所能推断出的潜能。也就是说，我们倾向于认为，成名的电影明星比仍在奋斗的电影明星更有天分，而世界上最富有的人也必然是最聪明的人。

我们也许不觉得自己是根据人们的收入或成功的外在表现来评判他们的。但哪怕我们明确知道一个人的薪水完全是随机确定的，也还是有许多人无法避免会直觉地认为薪水与价值有关。勒纳就考察了这个问题。他将观察者安排在一个小小的暗室中，面对一面单面透光的镜子坐着。从座位上，这些观察者能够观察一个放了一张桌子两把椅子且灯光明亮的小房间。实验者让这些观察者相信，汤姆和比尔这两名工人将很快进入房间，并一起花 15 分钟还原若干被打乱的单词。观察窗前面的窗帘此时是拉上的，而且勒纳告诉观察者，窗帘将一直保持这种状态，因为如果他们能听到但不能看到这两名工人，就可以在实验中排除由于外貌造成的影响。勒纳还告诉他们，由于经费有限，只能随机挑出一名工人付给他酬劳。勒纳离开房间后，助手打开开关，开始播放一卷录音带。这些观察者相信，他们听到了汤姆和比尔进入窗帘后的房间并开始工作。实际上，他们听到的只是汤姆和比尔朗读的一个固定剧本的录音，这个剧本经过特别设计，即使按多种客观标准来评判，人们也会觉得两个人对实验中的任务同样擅长。之后，实验要求对此毫不知情的观察者对汤姆和比尔的勤劳程度、创造性和成功程度进行评分。当汤姆被随机选为报酬获得者时，大约 90% 的观察者评判他为任务的完成做出了更多贡献；当比尔拿到钱时，则有大约 70% 的观察者持同样观点。尽管汤姆和比尔的表现相当，而且观察者也知道报酬是随机发放的，但是他们仍然认为得到报酬的工人比那个忙了半天却什么都没得到的人要好。哎，我们都太容易被某人赚到的钱愚弄了！所以才会有人把自己精心地打扮成成功人士的样子！

一系列相关研究也从这两名工人的视角探究了上述效应。人人都知道，具有适当的社会与学术资历、拥有响亮头衔及优渥收入的老板们，常常会更高地评价自己的观点，而不是下属的观点。研究者考虑的问题是，那些纯粹靠运气赚到更多钱的人，是不是也有这种想法？哪怕那些「成功」是不劳而获的，是否也在慢慢地向他们灌输一种高人一等的感觉？为了找到答案，研究者让若干对儿志愿者在很多无意义的任务中相互配合。例如在一项任务中，实验将短暂地显示一幅黑白图像，而受试者需要确定，图像的上部和下部，哪个部分的白色区域比例更大。每项任务开始前，一名受试者被随机挑出，并获得比另一名受试者明显更多的报酬。如果受试者并不知道他们各自获得报酬的情况，他们之间的协作就颇为融洽。可当他们知道了各自的报酬是多少时，报酬更高的那名受试者就会对其搭档的意见表现出更强烈的抵触态度。即使是报酬上的随机差别，也使人们做出以报酬推断技能的反向推理，并因此形成影响力上的不平等。这是个人及办公室动力学中不能忽视的部分。

但是问题的另一面，倒是离勒纳最初的动机更近一些。勒纳与同事提出的问题是，人们是否倾向于认为，那些不成功或正在承受痛苦的人，都是活该如此。研究将若干组女大学生集合在接待室中。几分钟后，其中一人被挑中并离开房间。我们称这名离开的学生为受害者，她实际上并非受试者，而是卧底的工作人员。然后剩下的受试者将对受害者进行观察。受害者将被要求完成一项学习任务，而每次她回答错误时，就会遭到一次电击。实验者调了一下据称可以控制电击强度的旋钮，然后打开电视监视器。受试者就这样看着受害者走进隔壁的房间，被缚上了一个「电击装置」，并开始学习一对儿对儿毫无意义的音节。

在学习期间，受害者由于回答错误而遭到几次看来颇为痛苦的电击，哀呼连连。实际上受害者不过是在演戏，而监视器播放的，只是一盘预先录制好的录像带。不出所料，大多数受试者在开始时都表示，同伴所遭受的不公正的磨难让她们感到不快。但随着实验继续进行，她们对受害者的同情慢慢减少。最终，这些无力提供帮助的受试者开始将不公平的批评加诸受害者。受害者遭受的痛苦越大，受试者对她的观感越差。正如勒纳预计的，受试者需要根据因果关系理解所面对的局面。为了确保不是别的什么因素造成了这个实验结果，实验者又在其他若干组受试者身上重复了该实验。但这一次他们还告诉受试者，受害者所吃的苦头将得到补偿。换句话说，除了让受试者相信受害者得到了「公平」对待这一点外，实验的其余部分与之前的完全相同。这一次，观察者没有形成恶评受害者的倾向。从这个实验来看，我们对那些来自社会底层的人持有的偏见，似乎很不幸地是一种下意识的行为。

我们没有看到随机性在生活中的影响，是因为在评价这个世界时，我们倾向于看到自己希望看到的东西。我们实际上是通过成功的程度来定义才能的高低的，然后再通过才能与成功之间的相关性进一步强化这种因果关系。尽管一个非常成功的人与一个不那么成功的人相比，他们的能力有时基本没什么差别，但我们看待他们的方式通常大不相同，原因就在于此。在《蓝色月光侦探社》播出之前，如果年轻的酒吧招待威利斯跟你说他希望成为电影明星，你肯定不会想：噢！有机会与这样一位魅力超凡的未来名流单独聊聊天，我可真是撞了大运了！相反，你更可能产生如下的想法：嗯，好吧，现在苦艾酒别喝过头就好。但节目大获成功的那一天，突然每个人都把威利斯视为明星，认为他是一个具有某种特殊能力，能抓住观众的心与想象力的家伙。

在几年前由心理学家罗森汉恩进行的一项大胆的实验中，预期的力量更是以戏剧性的方式被展示出来。实验中的 8 名「伪装病人」被分别派往多家医院。他们在医院接诊处抱怨听到了奇怪的声音。这些伪装病人的职业五花八门：三名自称是心理学家，一名是精神病学家，一名儿科医生，一个学生，一名画家，还有一位家庭主妇。除了声称的症状以及虚假的名字和职业，他们都如实描述了各自的日常生活。有些受试者后来表示，他们非常信任心理健康体系是以一种钟表般精准的方式运作的，因此他们一度担心医院会立刻发现他们的头脑显然是清醒而正常的，那就很令人难堪了。但他们完全多虑了。除了一名受试者，其余所有人都被允许进行精神分裂症的进一步诊断。而这名例外，也不过是要去看看他是不是得了躁狂抑郁症。

在医生接诊之后，受试者不再虚拟任何不正常的症状，并表示那些怪声都消失了。根据罗森汉恩预先所给的指示，他们接下来就等着医院的工作人员来发现，他们其实并没有发疯。但没有人注意到这一点。相反，医院工作人员透过预设的精神病的眼镜，来解释这些伪装病人的行为。当看到某位病人写日记时，他的护理记录被加上了一条「病人忙于书写」，并将书写视为精神疾病的一个标志。而当另一名病人因遭到服务人员的虐待而发怒时，这个行为同样被认为是其疾病的一部分。甚至连在自助餐厅开放之前就到那里等着吃午饭这样的行为，也被看成精神病的症状。倒是那些对伪装病人一无所知的其他病人，会常常用「你没有发疯，你是个记者…… 你在对这家医院进行暗访」这样的话来试探他们。但接诊伪装病人的医生们所做的记录类似于「该名 39 岁白人男性…… 长期以来在亲密关系中明显表现出正反情绪并存的情况，这种情况自幼年时就已经开始。与母亲的亲密关系在青春期时逐渐冷淡。与父亲的疏远关系则被描述为关系非常紧张」。

我们至少还是有个好消息的。尽管有着诸如喜欢写写画画和提前吃午饭等可疑行为，医生们总算还是认为这些伪装病人对自己和他人并不构成威胁，因此在医院平均待了 19 天后，他们都被放了出来。医院完全没有察觉到诡计的进行，而且当事后被告知真相时，医院否认了这种事情发生的可能性。

我们很容易沦为期望的受害者，却同样容易去利用这一点。在好莱坞全力拼搏的人们，却想方设法让自己看起来并没有怎么努力；医生们都穿着白大褂并在墙上挂满各种各样的执照和学位证书；二手车经销商宁可清理车辆表面的污迹，也不愿把钱花在引擎上；老师批改作业时，对完全相同的作业，给「优秀」学生的分数通常要比「差」学生的分数更高一些 ：之所以会出现这些情况，原因就是我们的期望被人利用了。搞市场推销的人同样知道这一点，所以他们会设计广告宣传诱惑并进而利用我们的期望。这种做法在伏特加市场相当行之有效。伏特加是一种中性烈酒，根据美国政府的规定蒸馏而成，其「没有可区分的性质、气味、味道或颜色」。因此，多数美国伏特加并不是由那些充满激情、身穿法兰绒衬衫、制造各种葡萄酒的人发明的，它们的发明者大多是农业化学品供应商阿彻丹尼尔斯米德兰这样的业界巨头。而伏特加酿酒师的工作，也不是通过管理酿造过程往酒中加入微妙的气味，而是往上述大公司提供的 190 份标准工业酒精样品中兑水，并尽可能去除其他味道。但是，通过大规模的幻觉制造，伏特加生产商成功地造成了人们对不同伏特加酒的差异的强烈期望。这种做法带来的结果，就是人们相信不同品牌但按定义而言应该是无法相互区分的伏特加酒，确实存在巨大的差异，而且他们还愿意为这些差异付出大把的钞票。为了不让自己被当作一个没有品位的乡巴佬踢出去，我很乐意指出，我的这些胡言乱语，其实是有办法检验的。我们可以排出一系列不同牌子的伏特加，再请一帮伏特加品酒师进行一次盲试。《纽约时报》就是这么做的。去掉标签之后，如灰雁伏特加和坎特一号伏特加这样高品位的伏特加，其表现就不怎么好了。事实上，相较于普遍的看法，检验结果看来是随机的。而且，在测试的 21 种伏特加中，价格最便宜的斯米诺伏特加得分最高。如果判断能与期待相隔离，并完全用数据来说话，那么我们对世界的评价将大为不同。

几年前，伦敦的《星期日泰晤士报》进行了一项实验。编辑们把获得了当代小说领域最有声望与影响力的世界性奖项之一的布克奖的两部小说，挑出各自的开头几章，用打字机打出来，并投稿到 20 个主要出版商和出版经纪人那里。两部小说一个是诺贝尔文学奖获得者奈保尔的《自由国度》，另一个则是斯坦利·米德尔顿的《假日》。我们完全有把握认为，收稿人要是知道稿件来历的话，他们一定会不吝溢美之词地夸奖这两部广受赞誉的小说。但《星期日泰晤士报》的编辑故意把这些投稿的小说片段，搞得好像是哪个还在努力奋斗等待出名的作家的作品一般，让出版商和出版经纪人无法看出稿件的真实来源。这两部非常成功的小说的命运如何呢？所有的答复都是退稿，只有一名伦敦的文学出版经纪人例外，他对米德尔顿的小说表示出一定的兴趣。不过即使是这样，他对奈保尔小说的评价也是：「我们…… 认为作品很具原创性，但恐怕它并不足以激发我们更多的兴趣。」

作家斯蒂芬·金无意中也进行过一次类似的实验。由于担心公众接受他的作品的速度没有他写书的速度快，他以理查德·巴赫曼的笔名写了一个小说系列。根据销量来看，即使是斯蒂芬·金，当他没有了这个名字之后，他也不再是斯蒂芬·金了（当作者的真实姓名终于曝光之后，该书的销量明显上升）。可悲的是，金却没有进行相反的实验：如果他把那些还未出名的作家所写的高质量但未出版的小说，用自己的名字包装之后，销量会怎样？但既然连斯蒂芬·金在没有这个名字时都不再是斯蒂芬·金，那么当我们这些「其他人」的作品得到的待遇不是那么「斯蒂芬·金」的时候，我们也许可以安慰一下自己，作品质量上的差别大概并不像某些人希望我们相信的那样悬殊。

我几年前在加州理工学院有一间办公室，就在一位名叫约翰·施瓦茨的物理学家的办公室过来拐角的地方。他几乎不为人所知，而且差不多是单枪匹马地坚持着一个名为「弦理论」的没人信的理论，该理论预言空间具有比我们观察到的三维还要多得多的维度。他忍受了整整 10 年的奚落。然后某一天，他与一名同事取得了技术上的突破，并由于一些跟本书关系不大的原因，那些多余的维度数突然间变得可接受了。之后，弦理论成为物理学最大的热点。如今，约翰被视为物理学界杰出的元老之一。但如果他在那些灰暗的年头中屈服了，他就会成为托马斯·爱迪生所说的「生活中的许多失败，乃是由于很多人没有认识到，在他们放弃的时候，他们是多么接近成功」这句话的活证据。

我所认识的另一名物理学家的经历与约翰惊人地相似。他碰巧就是约翰在加州大学伯克利分校的博士生导师。这位物理学家被认为是他那个时代最杰出的科学家之一，并且是一个被称为 S 矩阵理论的研究领域的带头人。与约翰一样，他十分固执，并在其他人都放弃的情况下，在这个理论上坚持研究了多年。但与约翰不同，他最终未能成功。正是由于没有成功，他成了许多人眼中的怪人，并以此身份结束了职业生涯。但我的意见是，他与约翰都是非常聪明的物理学家，也都有勇气在出现重大突破的前景还不明朗时，继续对这样一个理论进行研究。正如我们应该以作品的内容而非销量来评判作家一样，我们更应该根据能力评价物理学家及所有努力奋斗的人，而不是像在更多情况下那样只看他们有没有获得成功。

将能力与成功绑在一起的绳子，不仅很松，而且弹性十足。我们可以很容易在成功的书中发现其优点，也可以在未能出版的手稿、廉价的伏特加或仍然在某领域中艰苦奋斗的人的身上发现其缺点。我们轻易地相信奏效的点子都是好点子，成功的计划都设计良好，而没有奏效的点子与计划，根本就是在构思上有毛病。我们也很容易将那些最为成功的人塑造成英雄，而对那些最不成功的人报以轻蔑的一瞥。但能力并不保证一定能获得成就，而成就也并非与能力完全匹配。因此重要的一点是，我们不要忘记成功方程式中偶然性的那一项所扮演的角色。

将某领域最为成功的人视作超级英雄，这并不是悲剧。但如果我们的放弃是因为信任专家评判或市场业绩，而不是出于对自己的了解，就是一个悲剧了，正如图尔在他后来成为畅销书的《笨蛋联盟》的手稿被一次次退稿后自杀那样。因此，在试图根据某人的成功程度评价他 / 她时，我会提醒自己，如果他们有机会从头再来，斯蒂芬·金也许不过是另一个理查德·巴赫曼，奈保尔也不过是另一个还在努力拼搏的作家。而在那默默无闻的人群中，还游荡着许许多多与比尔·盖茨、布鲁斯·威利斯和罗杰·马里斯同样了不起的人，只不过命运没有赐给他们那些刚好被人们需要的划时代的产品、电视节目，或体育赛季。我从这些例子中学到的，就是我们首先需要一往无前，因为对我们来说最大的好消息就是，既然偶然性确实在我们的成功中扮演了某个角色，那么通往成功的要素之一已经掌握在我们手中，那就是我们上垒击球的次数，我们获得机会的次数，我们把握机会的次数。因为即使是一枚更容易扔出失败结果的硬币，有时也会获得成功。或者如 IBM 老总裁托马斯·华生说的那样：「要成功，就把你的失败次数加倍。」

我一直在本书中试着向读者展示随机性的基本概念，说明它们在各种问题中的应用方式，并表明我的如下观点：在解释事件时，以及在进行预期和决策时，随机性的作用很大程度上被忽视了。哪怕只是认识到随机过程在生活中所扮演的无处不在的角色，都足以让我们豁然醒悟。但随机过程理论的真正力量，在于一旦理解了随机过程的本性，我们就会改变看待周围事物的方式。

心理学家罗森汉恩写道：「一个人一旦不正常，他所有的举止和特征就会被挂上‘不正常’的标签。」对演员以及其他许多成功或失败的标签来说，这句话同样适用。我们通过结果评判他人和他们的动机。我们希望事情之所以发生，是因为有一个好的且我们能够理解的原因。但我们所看到的清晰的必然性，通常不过是错觉而已。我相信，在面对不确定性时，我们能够调整我们的思维方式。正是出于这种信念，我写下了这本书。我们可以提高决策技巧，并克服某些能带来不当判断与选择的偏见。我们不应该通过以成败论英雄的方式，了解他人的能力与其他各种状况。而且我们应该学会根据所有可能结果的分布而非实际所得的具体结果，判断决策的优劣。

母亲总是告诫我，不要以为自己可以预测或控制未来。她跟我说起让她产生这种信念的事件。事情与她姐姐萨比娜有关。尽管母亲上次见到她已经是 65 年前的事儿了，但母亲仍然常常提到她。母亲当时 15 岁，她很崇拜姐姐，正如弟弟妹妹们对哥哥姐姐有时怀有的崇敬那样。当时纳粹已经侵入波兰，我那出身贫民区的父亲加入了地下抵抗组织，后来被关进了布痕瓦尔德集中营。当时还不认识父亲的母亲则出生于富人区，她被关到一个劳改营里。在那里，她被指派为护士的助手照料斑疹伤寒患者。当时食物十分稀缺，不可预料的死亡却总在近旁。为了在那危险无时不在的环境中保护我的母亲，萨比娜采取了行动。她的一名朋友是犹太警察成员，这些警察按照德国人的命令维持集中营的秩序，并通常遭到集中营内其他人的蔑视。萨比娜的朋友向她求婚，虽然只是名义上的婚姻，因为这样一来，萨比娜就能得到他的职位所能提供的保护。考虑到我的母亲也可以沾光，萨比娜接受了求婚。然后不好的事情发生了。德国人开始讨厌这些犹太警察，并把若干犹太警察连同他们的配偶一起送进了毒气室，其中就包括萨比娜和她的丈夫。相较于与萨比娜相处的日子，我母亲现在已经活过了更长的岁月，但萨比娜的死仍然纠缠着她。母亲担心一旦自己过世，萨比娜留下的痕迹就不复存在了。对她而言，这个故事说明做计划根本是毫无意义的事情。我并不赞同这一点，我相信计划十分重要，如果我们是睁开双眼去做计划的话。但更重要的是，母亲的经历告诉我，我们应当看到我们获得的好运，并对此心怀感恩，进而认识到随机事件在成功中所占的分量。这件事还教会我要接受那些令人悲痛的偶然事件。最重要的是，它教会了我感恩，我庆幸自己没有碰到坏运气，没有碰到那些可能彻底击垮我的事，没有经历疾病、战争、饥荒，以及那些没有 —— 或者还没有 —— 降临到我身上的意外。
