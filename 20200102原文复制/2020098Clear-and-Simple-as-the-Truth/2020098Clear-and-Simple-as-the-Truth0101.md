## 0101. Principles of Classic Style

第一部分 古典风格的原理

1.0 导语

讲古典风格之前，我们要先了解什么是风格，以及一些常见风格与古典风格的区别。如果只能感觉一篇文章有风格，却不知道什么决定了风格，或者误以为调整字词就能形成风格，那么写好文章恐怕只是凭运气罢了。本书第一部分将带领大家认识不同风格，培养写作中的风格意识，选用一种比你的默认风格更实用、更自然的风格来进人写作的秘境。

### 1.1 The Concept of Style

「Style」is a word everybody uses, but almost no one can explain what it means. It is often understood as the inessential or even disreputable member of a two-term set: style and substance. This set of terms is elastic but in all its many applications, style is the subordinate term and, in the traditional American idiom, there is a persistent suggestion that we would be better off without it. Style is, at best, a harmless if unnecessary bit of window dressing. At worst, it is a polite name for fraud. There used to be a cigar company whose motto was「All Quality. No Style.」

When style is considered the opposite of substance, it seems optional and incidental, even when it is admired. In this way of framing things, substantive thought and meaning can be prior to style and completely separable from it. The identical thought or the identical meaning, it is suggested, can be expressed in many styles—or even in none at all, as when just plain integrity or the unvarnished truth is offered as an alternative to the adornments of style. Style, conceived this way, is something fancy that distracts us from what is essential; it is the varnish that makes the truth at least a little harder to see.

The notion that style is something completely separate from substance, so that substance can be offered「straight,」lies behind both the motto of the cigar company and William Butler Yeats's description of Bernard Shaw's writing, but in the second case the poet puts a high value on style and views writing in no style, while possible, to be something monstrously mechanical. Yeats apparently thought of his own characteristic poetic voice as「style.」It was a voice so compelling that attempts to imitate it have ruined quite a number of aspiring poets. Shaw's voice was not poetic in Yeats's sense, so Yeats considered Shaw to be a writer「without style.」Because he held the view that style is optional, Yeats could simultaneously view Shaw as「the most formidable man in modern letters,」able to write「with great effect,」and yet view Shaw's writing as「without music, without style, either good or bad.」He described Shaw as a nightmare sewing machine that clicked, shone, and smiled,「smiled perpetually.」

Whether style is viewed as spiritual, fraudulent, or something in between, any concept of style that treats it as optional is inadequate not only to writing but to any human action. Nothing we do can be done「simply」and in no style, because style is something inherent in action, not something added to it. In this respect, style is like the typeface in which a text is printed. We may overlook it, and frequently do, but it is always there. The styles we acquire unconsciously remain invisible to us as a rule, and routine actions can seem to be done in no style at all, even though their styles are obvious to experienced observers. A printer, a proofreader, or a type designer cannot fail to notice the type in which a text is printed, but for most of us, that typeface will have to be laid down beside a contrasting face before we even notice it exists. We thought we were looking at words pure and simple and did not notice that they are printed in a specific typeface.

When we do something in a default style acquired unconsciously, we do not notice the style of our activity. In such cases, we have an abstract concept of action that leaves style out of account. We can have a concept of lying without being aware—as a good investigative reporter is—that, in practice, we must have a style of lying. We can have a concept of quarreling without being aware—as a good marriage counselor is—that, in practice, we must have a style of quarreling.

Despite a lifetime of speaking, we can remain unaware of having a style of speaking. Yankees in Maine or Good ol' Boys in Louisiana think that people from Brooklyn talk funny. WASPS in the Chicago suburbs think that Poles or Lithuanians in Chicago speak English with an accent, as if the suburban WASPS, the Yankees, and the Good ol' Boys speak just plain American English with no accent. Coastal Californians think—just as the ancient Greeks did—that everybody else sounds barbarous. A moment's reflection will convince anyone that it is impossible to speak without an accent. But people who feel they set the local tone do not consider their own accents to be accents. It is hard to think of a child who is just learning to speak wanting to learn a style of speaking. The style is folded into the activity as it is learned: we think that we have learned to speak a language, not that we have learned a regional dialect. Children in Maine do not think they are learning to speak English with a Yankee accent; they think they are learning to speak English.

Although there are certainly a lot of English accents to be heard, even if we restrict the field to America, only a few people consciously choose theirs. Professional broadcasters, of course, do; sometimes people interested in acting careers do. Many politicians with degrees from prestigious universities have learned to speak with one accent in the capitals where they make laws and policy and quite a different one back home where they campaign for office. Senator Fulbright was a Rhodes scholar with an Oxford education. Before he went to the Senate, he had been the dean of a law school and the president of a university. His background was perfectly congruent with what he sounded like in action as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee conducting hearings on the Vietnam War, but when he campaigned in rural Arkansas, where he got his votes, there was no hint of Oxford, or even Fayetteville. On the stump, he sounded completely down home. After the election, that sound dissipated with every mile he got closer to Washington until he was sworn in for a new term and reassumed both the seat of power and the music of policy.

Senator Fulbright could maintain two dramatically distinct styles of speech in his personal repertory because he was aware of both as styles and consequently did not mistake either of them for just plain English. His awareness of his own styles allowed him to switch back and forth between them and fit them to circumstances. Everyone does this to some extent, but not everyone is aware of doing so. Speakers who are not consciously aware of their styles run into problems when none of their habitual styles fits a particular circumstance very well. We are trapped by our unconscious styles if we cannot recognize them as styles. When all of our styles are effectively default styles, we choose without knowing we are choosing and so cannot recognize the practical possibility of alternative styles.

People who unconsciously have acquired a full complement of routine conversational styles can deliberately and consciously add a new style of conversation to their collection, a style invented for new purposes and situations, once they have an operating concept of style. A novice receptionist at the headquarters of a large corporation consciously acquires the standard impersonal business style of conversation. The receptionist already possesses an underlying competence in conversation; he consciously acquires a new style meant for a special and unusually well-defined purpose.

Because writing is an activity, it too must be done in a style. But the domain of writing, like the domain of conversation, is enormous, not limited by just a handful of occasions or purposes. Consequently, there are many styles of writing. Common wisdom to the contrary, no one can master writing because writing is too large to be encompassed. It is not one skill; it is not even a small bundle of routine skills. A single style of writing invented for particular purposes, however, can be like a receptionist's conversation, something small enough to be walked around. It is possible to see where it begins and where it ends, what its purposes and occasions are, and how it selects its themes. These styles of writing can be acquired consciously as styles. Classic style is one of them.

Although nearly anybody who can read a newspaper can write, the styles we acquired unconsciously do not always serve our needs. Most of us have no unconscious writing style available to use when, after becoming engaged in a problem, we have thought it through, reached confident conclusions, and want to make our thought accessible to a permanent but unspecified audience. Even the best-educated members of our society commonly lack a routine style for presenting the result of their own engagement with a problem to people outside their own profession. Writers with a need to address such readers invented classic style. It is not a routine style in our culture, and unlike most of the writing styles we acquire, it is unlikely to be picked up without deliberate effort.

Classic style was not invented by one person or even by a small group working together. It was not invented just once, nor is it specific to one culture or one language. It was used with notable skill and effect by some of the outstanding French writers of the seventeenth century, and their achievements have left an echo in French culture that has no direct English or American equivalent. The seventeenth-century French masters of classic style, for one reason or another, conceived of themselves as addressing an intelligent but nonspecialist reader. They were all writers who had no doubt about the general importance of what they had to say. They shared the idea that truth about something is, in some sense, truth about everything, and they adopted the view that it is always possible to present a really significant conclusion to a general audience.

Classic style is focused and assured. Its virtues are clarity and simplicity; in a sense, so are its vices. It declines to acknowledge ambiguities, unessential qualifications, doubts, or other styles. It declines to acknowledge that it is a style. It makes its hard choices silently and out of the reader's sight. Once made, those hard choices are not acknowledged to be choices at all; they are presented as if they were inevitable because classic style is, above all, a style of presentation with claims to transparency.

To write without a chosen and consistent style is to write without a tacit concept of what writing can do, what its limits are, who its audience is, and what the writer's goals are. In the absence of settled decisions about these things, writing can be torture. While there is no single correct view of these matters, every well-defined style must take a stand on them. Classic style is neither shy nor ambiguous about fundamentals. The style rests on the assumptions that it is possible to think disinterestedly, to know the results of disinterested thought, and to present them without fundamental distortion. In this view, thought precedes writing. All of these assumptions may be wrong, but they help to define a style whose usefulness is manifest.

The attitudes that define classic style—the attitudes that define any style—are a set of enabling conventions. Some of the originators of classic style may have believed its enabling conventions—such as that truth can be known—but writing in this style requires no commitment to a set of beliefs, only a willingness to adopt a role for a limited time and a specific purpose.

The role is severely limited because classic prose is pure, fearless, cool, and relentless. It asks no quarter and gives no quarter to anyone, including the writer. While the role can be necessary, true, and useful, as well as wonderfully thrilling, it can hardly be permanent. For better or worse, human beings are not pure, fearless, cool, or relentless, even if we may find it convenient for certain purposes to pretend that we are. The human condition does not, in general, allow the degree of autonomy and certainty that the classic writer pretends to have. It does not sustain the classic writer's claim to disinterested expression of unconditional truth. It does not allow the writer indefinitely to maintain the posture required by classic style. But classic style simply does not acknowledge the human condition. The insouciance required to ignore what everyone knows and to carry the reader along in this style cannot be maintained very long, and the masters of the style always know its limits. The classic distance is a sprint.

0101 风格与古典风格

1.1 风格的概念

「风格」是每个人都会用的词，但几乎没人可以解释它的含义。「风格」与「内容」是一组词，但「风格」通常被认为不必要，甚至略带贬义。这组词使用灵活，但在多数用法中，风格是次要的一项，而且美国传统习语一直暗含这样的意思：没有风格我们会更好。往好说，风格可以装点门面，虽无必要但也无害；往坏说，这只是弄虚作假的委婉表达。过去有一家雪茄公司的标语就是「只要质量，无须风格」（AⅡ Quality, No Style.）。

即使人们欣赏风格，但风格被当作内容的对立面时，看起来只是一条可选的附加项。按照这种说法，内容上的思想和意义是先于风格产生的，且两者完全独立。也就是说，同样的思想或同样的意义可以用多种风格表达 —— 甚至什么风格都不用，我们可以选择某种风格来修饰，也可以直白坦率地、不加修饰地陈述。这样看，风格只是一种妨碍我们看到事物本来面目的装饰物；它好比给真相涂上一层清漆，至少看得不那么清晰了。

风格与内容完全独立，所以内容可以「直接」表达出来，这不是雪茄公司广告标语独有的理念，诗人威廉·巴特勒·叶芝在描述萧伯纳的作品时也持有同样的观点，不同的是，叶芝认为风格很重要，没有风格的作品即便存在，也是极其机械的东西。显然，叶芝把自己作品中独特的诗意音韵看作「风格」。它是一种迷人的音韵，吸引众多雄心勃勃的诗人竞相模仿，结果反倒毁了这些诗人的名声。在叶芝看来，萧伯纳的音韵毫无诗意可言，所以他认为萧伯纳是一位「没有风格」的作家。因为秉持风格可以选择这种观点，叶芝认为萧伯纳是「现代文学中最可怕的人」1，文章「影响深远」，但又觉得萧伯纳写的东西「没有音乐，没有风格，说不上好也说不上坏」。叶芝将萧伯纳描述为一台噩梦般的缝纫机，咔嗒咔嗒，闪耀着，微笑着，「永不消逝的微笑」。

无论风格是一种精神追求，还是徒有其表、华而不实，或两者兼而有之，凡是认为风格是可以选择的，不光写不好文章，也做不好任何其他事。没有哪一件事可以不用任何风格「简单」地做，因为风格是行为本身含有的，不是附加其上的。就这点而言，风格就像文本的字体。我们可能会忽略它，也确实经常忽略，但它一直在那里。我们通常注意不到无意识使用的风格，习以为常的行为好像什么风格也没有，但有经验的人很容易看到这些风格。印刷工、校对员或字体设计师不会注意不到文本的字体，但对于大多数人来说，要把那种字体和截然不同的字体放在一起才会看出差别。我们以为看的是纯粹简单的文字，没有注意到它们用了某种特定的字体。

我们做事自带某种无意识学到的风格时，不会注意到自己的行事风格。这个时候我们对行为只有抽象的概念，不会考虑到风格。我们有撒谎的概念，但不会像一位称职的调查记者一样，意识到我们实际上肯定会用某种撒谎风格：我们有争吵的概念，但不会像一位称职的婚烟顾向一样，意识到我们实际上肯定会用某种争吵风格。

尽管我们一生都在说话，但可能一直都未意识到我们有一种说话风格。美国缅因州的洋基人或路易斯安那州的南方乡村白人，觉得布鲁克林的人说话很好玩。芝加哥郊区的盎格鲁-撒克逊白人清教徒认为芝加哥的波兰人或立陶宛人说英语有口音，好像郊区的盎格鲁-撒克白人清教徒、洋基人和南方乡村白人说的是无口音的纯正美国英语一样。沿海的加州人认为 —— 就和古希腊人认为的那样 —— 所有其他人说的话听起来都很野蛮。细想一下就会明白，说话不可能没口音。但那些自认为说着本土正宗腔调的人，不会把自己的口音当口音。很难想象一个牙牙学语的孩子，会想着学习某种说话风格。学语言自然会学它自带的风格：我们自以为学了一门语言，而不是学了某个地区的方言。缅因州的孩子不会觉得他们学的是带洋基人口音的英语，他们觉得他们学的就是英语。

我们一定听过很多不同的英语口音，尽管只考虑美国这一个国家，也只有少数人会有意识地选择说话的口音。职业播音员当然会用口音；有时候对演艺事业感兴趣的人也会用口音。许多毕业于名牌大学的政治家会在不同场合用不同口音，比如在制定法律和政策的首都说一种口音，回家乡竞选公职时用完全不同的口音。参议员富布菜特是一名罗德学者，有牛津大学教育背景。去参议院之前，他曾担任法学院院长和大学校长。作为参议院外交关系委员会主席，他举行越战听证会时说话的口音完全符合他的背景；但当他在阿肯色州乡村竞选赢取选票时，听不出来一点牛津口音，甚至连费耶特维尔乡音都没有。做巡回演说时，他听起来是土生土长的本地人。选举结束回华盛顿的路上，离华盛顿越近，那种口音就越弱，直到他宣誓连任重新执掌政权时，操一口政客腔。

参议员富布赖特在巡演时能保持两种截然不同的演说风格，因为他知道两种演说都有各自的风格，所以不会把其中一种误当作纯正英语。知道自己使用的风格，他就能自如切换风格以适应不同场合。在某种程度上，每个人都会这样做，但并不是每个人都能意识到这点。那些不会特意注意自己说话风格的人，碰到某个场合不适用默认风格时，就会遇到问题。如果我们认不出自己的风格，就会困在自己的无意识风格中。当我们使用的风格实际上全都是默认风格时，我们做了选择却不自知，也就不知道可以选用更合适的风格。

无意识中掌握了整套日常会话风格的人，如果有运用风格的概念，可以为新的目的和情境再特意学一种会话风格。一位刚入职某家大公司总部的接待员，特意学会了不带个人情感色彩的标准商务会话风格。该接待员已经具备一种潜在的会话能力；为某个具体的特别目的，他特意学了一种新风格。

写作是一项活动，必然也是带着某种风格的。但是，写作和对话一样，范畴很广，不限于个别几种场合或目的。因此写作风格有很多种。和人们通常认为的不一样，没有人能掌握写作，因为写作的范围广到难以涵盖。它不是某一项技巧，也不是某几项技巧的组合。但我们很容易学会专为某种特定目的发明的写作风格，就像接待员学习会话一样。我们能看出它从哪里开始，到哪里结束，目的是什么，场景是什么，怎么选择主题。可以通过专门的学习学会这些写作风格。古典风格是这些风格中的一种。

一个人只要会阅读，基本上就会写作，但我们无意识学会的风格有些时候并不顶用。当我们在某个问题上冥思苦想得出自信的结论，想向一群固定的读者表达我们的想法，但又不知道这些读者是谁时，我们大多数人无意识学会的风格都用不上。即使是我们这个社会上学识最好的人，也很难用自己惯用的风格向外行人说明他们在某个问题上的研究成果。一些需要面向这类读者的作家发明了古典风格。它不是我们文化中的惯用风格，也不像我们大多数人学到的写作风格，它需要刻意去学才能学会。

古典风格不是某个人或某个一起工作的小团体发明出来的。它不是一次就发明出来的，也不是专为某种文化或某种语言发明出来的。古典风格被十七世纪杰出的法国作家运用得出神入化，他们的成就在法国文化中留下了英美文化不曾出现的回响。十七世纪法国的古典风格大师，因为某些原因，把自己的读者定位为聪明的外行人。他们是一群自信的作家，认定自己的话对每个读者都很重要。他们认同 —— 从某种意义上来说 —— 某件事的真相可以是所有事的真相，他们相信始终有可能向广大读者呈现真正重要的结论。

古典风格是明确的、肯定的。它的优点是清晰简单，但从某种意义上来说，这也是它的缺点。古典风格不接受模糊的表述、不必要的附加条件、支支吾吾或其他做派。它拒不承认它是一种风格。它暗自做出困难的选择，不让读者察觉。一旦决定，这些困难的选择压根不被看成是选择；它们的呈现好像非此不可一样，因为古典风格的首要特点是透明、无痕的呈现型风格。

没有确定一致风格的写作，自然不会考虑到写作能做什么，它的局限在哪，它的读者是谁，作者的目标是什么。若不对这些问题做出确切的选择，写作会很痛苦。虽然这些问题的观点不是唯一的，但每一种明确的风格必须采取一种立场。古典风格对基本问题既不会回避，也不会模棱两可。古典风格依存的假设是，人可以客观地思考，能知道客观思考的结果，呈现出来也不会有所偏倚。从这点来看，思想形成于写作之前。所有这些假设可能是错的，但它们可以帮助确立一种风格，这种风格的作用也很明显。

那些决定古典风格的态度 —— 决定任何一种风格的态度 —— 由一组基础规约构成。最开始使用古典风格的一些人，可能一直都信奉它的基础规约 —— 比如真相可知 —— 但是用这种风格写作，不需要作者信奉一组信念，只要作者愿意出于某种特定目的在一定时间内扮演一种角色即可。

这种角色受到严格的约束，因为古典风格的文章纯粹、无畏、冷静、无情。它不寻求怜悯，也不怜悯任何人，包括作者本人。尽管这样的角色必要、真实、有用，也令人激动不已，但很难长久。不管是好是坏，人类做不到纯粹、无畏、冷静或无情，即使为了达到某些目的而假装成这样很方便。以人类的条件，通常无法让古典风格作者表现出他希望的那种自主和笃定，也无法满足古典风格作者客观表达无条件真相的要求。它无法让作者一直维持古典风格要求的姿态。但古典风格就是不承认人类的实际情况。它要求漠视人人知道的事情，把读者带入这种风格中，这种漠视无法维持很长时间，而古典风格大师总能把握它的局限。古典风格是一场限时冲刺短跑。

### 1.2 Recognizing Classic Style

Classic style never became the standard for English prose that it has been at various times for French. The most admired prose writers in English have never been as successful in creating any dominant style as the most admired French prose writers of the seventeenth century were in making classic style a cultural norm. The reasons are many and defy simple summary, but they probably include the existence of an exceptionally influential line of verse writers in English—a line with no French counterpart; the profound influence of the King James translation of the Bible on English prose style; the great diversity of styles among admired English prose writers; and the fact that English prose before the eighteenth century cannot serve as a direct model for later writing. Seventeenth-century English prose seems archaic to later English readers; seventeenth-century French prose is perfectly normal even to a contemporary French reader.

Certain classic French writers—Descartes, Pascal, the duc de La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Lafayette, the Cardinal de Retz, Madame de Sévigné, and La Bruyère—have been taken as models of French prose practically from their day to ours. Indeed, for many, their French is French. Those who admire it rarely fail to single out for praise its clarity, suppleness, and elegance.

Propagandists, in the course of promoting the use of French as an international diplomatic language, attributed these marks of style to something inherent in the French language. Antoine Rivarol is the author of the best-known version of this primitive excursion into salesmanship as essentialist linguistics. Language, Professor Rivarol observes, is clear when it follows the order of reason, and unclear when it follows the movements and order of our experience. But, behold, French has a unique privilege among languages: its natural order is the order of reason. It is, therefore, necessarily clear where Greek, Latin, Italian, and English are not. In the absence of the uniquely French syntax of reason, writing in other languages is heir to all the fog and filthy air that passion and sensation impart. Rivarol won a prize for a disquisition based on these observations in the eighteenth century; today both his argument and his conclusion sound like a parody of alchemy. In the age of Derrida and Lacan, French prose has triumphantly displayed its capacity to be as incomprehensible, elephantine, and turgid as double-Dutch.

The almost transparent silliness of attributing marks of style to the inherent qualities of particular languages has not discouraged the practice even among accomplished writers who ought to know better. T. S. Eliot, in observing that English writers at no time looked to a common standard, attributes this fact to what he takes to be an inherent characteristic of the language.「The English language,」he pronounces,「is one which offers a wide scope for legitimate divergences of style; it seems to be such that no one age, and certainly no one writer, can establish a norm.」

It seems superfluous to argue that classic style does not issue from French or from any other language as such. All we have to do is look at its history. French classic style was invented by drawing together and refining attitudes and practices found in antiquity among writers of Greek and Latin, and the invaluable instrument that resulted has long been employed by classic stylists in English, although no English philosopher with the cultural standing of Descartes consistently employs it, nor was there ever such a remarkable group of classic writers in English at any one time as there was in the French grand siècle.

Consider, as an example of classic style, the following passage from La Rochefoucauld:

Madame de Chevreuse had sparkling intelligence, ambition, and beauty in plenty; she was flirtatious, lively, bold, enterprising; she used all her charms to push her projects to success, and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way.

Mme de Chevreuse avait beaucoup d'esprit, d'ambition et de beauté; elle était galante, vive, hardie, entreprenante; elle se servait de tous ses charmes pour réussir dans ses desseins, et elle a presque toujours porté malheur aux personnes qu'elle y a engagées.

This passage displays truth according to an order that has nothing to do with the process by which the writer came to know it. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge. This pose implies that the writer has wide and textured experience; otherwise he would not be able to make such an observation. But none of that personal history, personal experience, or personal psychology enters into the expression. Instead the sentence crystallizes the writer's experience into a timeless and absolute sequence, as if it were a geometric proof. The sentence has a clear direction and a goal. It leads us to that goal, which coincides with its final phrase; it is constructed to telegraph its direction. We know that it will bring us to its goal, and stop cleanly when it has done so.

By contrast, consider the opening sentence of Samuel Johnson's「Preface to Shakespeare,」which is a master's recital piece, but is not classic:

That praises are without reason lavished on the dead, and that the honours due only to excellence are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time.

This sentence does not telegraph its structure from the opening. We must follow it through complex and unexpected paths. In La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence, the last section is the conclusion of all that has gone before it; the beginning of the sentence exists for the end, and the sentence is constructed so that we can anticipate arriving at such a conclusion. In Johnson's sentence, by contrast, the final phrase,「flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time,」is not a conclusion upon which the rest of the sentence depends. It might have come in the middle of the sentence. The end of the sentence might have been「be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox.」This does not make the sentence inadequate in any way, but it is characteristically unclassic. The classic sentence, once written, seems to have been inevitable.

La Rochefoucauld's sentence was of course difficult to write, but it looks easy. The writer hides all the effort. Johnson's sentence was clearly difficult to write, and its writer wants to display it as if it were a trophy won through his personal effort.

La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence pretends that it could be said. It would take a true master of speech to construct such a sentence spontaneously. In fact we sense that the rhythm is too perfect to be spontaneous. Still, it sounds like ideally efficient and precise speech. If angels spoke French, it would sound like this. Johnson's sentence, by contrast, can only be writing that took effort. In its rhythms, we do not hear someone speaking spontaneously. One could memorize it and repeat it in speech, but even then it would sound like memorized writing, not like speech. In the theology behind Johnson's sentence, writing is hard and noble, because truth is the reward of effort and cannot be captured in spontaneous speech. In the theology behind La Rochefoucauld's sentence, writing should look easy even as it looks masterful. Truth is a grace that flees from earnest effort. The language of truth is ideally graceful speech.

La Rochefoucauld's sentence is a prototype of classic style. The conceptual and linguistic environment associated with classic style is extremely rich and complex. No classic text—not even a prototype—incorporates all of it. Any list of criteria would be misconceived: some texts lack central attributes of classic style and yet are obviously classic; other texts are faintly classic throughout; still others have isolated parts that are strongly classic; some texts incorporate only a few elements of classic style; some clearly unclassic texts contain marks of classic style; some texts have the verbal marks of classic style but none of its theology; some texts lie between classic style and another style.

Consider the gradient between plain style and classic style.「The truth is pure and simple」is plain style.「The truth is rarely pure, and never simple」is classic style. The plain version contains many elements of classic style without being classic; the classic version contains all of the plain version without being plain.

The concept of classic style assumes that plain style already exists. The classic version introduces a refinement, a qualification, a meditation on the plain version that makes it classic. Classic style takes the attitude that it is superior to plain style because classic style presents intelligence as it should be presented: as a sparkling display, not weighed down by grinding earnestness. The classic writer wants to be distinguished from others because she assumes that truth, though potentially available to all, is not the common property of common people, and that it is not to be perceived or expressed through common means unrefined. The classic writer sees common sense as only an approximation which, left untested and unrefined, can turn out to be false. The plain writer wants to be common because she assumes that truth is the common property of common people, directly perceived and expressed through common means. For the plain writer, common sense is truth. Unlike plain style, classic style is aristocratic, which is not to say artificially restricted, since anyone can become an aristocrat by learning classic style. Anyone who wants to can attain classic style, but classic style views itself as an intellectual achievement, not a natural endowment.

There are many features of classic style besides a simple and elegant shape and the introduction of some refinement in the thought. Behind these features is a complicated, polished, and fascinating view of truth and language, writers and readers. The rest of this essay is an attempt to lay out the features of classic style and their underlying conceptual stand.

1.2 辨识古典风格

古典风格从来不是英语散文的典范，但曾在不同的时代被尊为法语散文的典范。十七世纪最负盛名的法语散文作家把古典风格推为一种文化规范，历代才华出众的英语散文作家在创造任何一种主流风格上从未取得如此成就。其原因有很多，并非三言两语可以概括，但很可能有以下几个原因：1）历史上有一大批影响深远的英语诗歌创作者，其数量之多非法语作家能比拟；2）钦定版圣经（KJV）对英语散文风格产生了深刻影响；3）杰出的英语散文作家创造了非常多元化的写作风格；4）十八世纪以前的英语散文很难成为后世直接模仿的典范。十七世纪的英语散文对后来的英文读者来说似乎过时了，而十七世纪的法语散文甚至在当代法语读者看来也极为日常。

一些古典风格法语作家 —— 笛卡儿（Descartes）、帕斯卡（Pascal）、弗朗索瓦·德·拉罗什福科（the duc de La Rochefoucauld）、拉法耶特夫人（Madame de Lafayette）、莱兹（the Cardinal de Retz）、塞维涅夫人（Madame de Sevigne）及拉布吕耶尔（La Bruyere）—— 几乎自他们的时代起直至今天，一直都是法语散文作家的模范。事实上，对多数人而言，他们的法语才是真正的法语。欣赏法语散文的人，说起它的优点很少不提到它清晰、灵活与优雅的特点。

法语宣扬者在推行法语作为国际外交用语时，把这些风格特征归于法语固有的一些东西。安托万·里瓦罗尔（Antoine de Rivarol）2 是早期本质主义语言学著作写得最好的作者。里瓦罗尔观察到，语言遵循推理顺序时很清晰，遵循我们体验的活动及顺序时则不清晰。但要注意的是，在众多语言中，法语有一个独特的优势，即它固有的顺序正好就是推理顺序。因此，那些希腊语、拉丁语、意大利语和英语说不明白的地方，用法语就能讲明白。因为其他语言没有法语特有的推理句法，写出来的文章承袭的是激情和感受散发出来的所有迷雾和浊气。十八世纪，里瓦罗尔根据这些观察结果写过专题论述，还获得了表彰。今天看来，他的论证过程及结论，听起来像模仿拙劣的炼金术。德里达（Derrida）及拉康（Lacan）的时代，写出来的法语文章如「天书」一般晦涩难懂、臃肿乏味。

2『第一次知道法语的一个特点：其固有的顺序正好是推理顺序。做一张任意卡片。（2022-03-05）』—— 已完成

即使是才华横溢的作家也未能幸免，他们本应见多识广，却也犯下这般显而易见的错误，认为风格特征是特定语言固有的优势。TS. 艾略特 (TS. Eio）注意到英语作家从不参照共同标准，但他把这个事实归咎于所谓的英语固有特征。他说：「英语语言，为合理多样化的风格提供了广阔的空间，似乎没有哪一段时期，当然也没有哪一位作家，能建立某种范式。」3

古典风格并非发源于法语或任何其他语言，说这话似乎有些多余。

我们回看古典风格的历史就知道了。古典风格源自对古代希腊语作家和拉丁语作家的态度及实践的总结提炼，英语古典风格作家长期以来一直受用于这种宝贵经验，只是说没有哪位资深的英语哲学家像笛卡儿那样一以贯之地使用这种风格，也没有哪个时期像法国「大世纪」时期一样涌现出一批杰出的英语古典风格作家。

我们举一段拉罗什福科的话作为古典风格的例子：

选段 1-1

谢弗勒兹夫人光芒四射，集智慧、抱负和美丽于一身；她风情万千、活泼大胆、勇于开拓：她动用她全部的魅力，争取把事情办成功，在这过程中她几乎总是给那些她碰到的人带来灾难。4

这段话展示真相的顺序和作者实际认识真相的过程无关。作者是以一种全知的姿态，这种姿态暗示作者有细致入微的丰富体验，不然他无法做出这样的观察。但他的表达没有混杂任何个人历史、个人经历或个人心理。相反，这句话将作者的经历凝结成一组永恒且绝对的序列，就像这种经历是一个几何证明题。这个句子有清晰的方向和目标。它把我们引向那个目标，与它末尾的短语交汇；句子组织起来是为了指明它的方向。我们知道它会把我们引向它的目标，一旦做到即刻终止。

我们再看看一个对比的例子，出自塞缪尔·约翰逊（Samuel Johnson）《莎士比亚戏剧集序言》（Preface to Shakespeare）的开头几句，这是大师的独奏曲，但不是古典风格：

我们可能永远听到有人抱怨说我们对于死人妄加赞扬，说我们对古人怀着他们不应得到的尊敬，这种尊敬只有真正优秀的作家才配享受。什么人常说这样的抱怨话呢？他们可能是这样一种人：虽然他们的话不能算是真理，他们却想靠着发表似是而非的谬论而出名：他们也可能是另一类的人：这些人由于不得志而不得不设法安慰自己，因此希望他们在当代所不能获得的名誉地位，后代的人会送给他们，因此他们妄想他们由于妒忌而受不到重视，最后时间会给他们带来人们对他们的重视。5

我们无法从这句话的开头看出它的结构。要理解它，我们必须穿过复杂难料的小径。在拉罗什福科的古典句子中，最后部分是前面所有内容的总结，句子开头是为了结尾而存在，句子组织起来就是让我们能够预料这样的结论。相反，在约翰逊的句子中，最后一句「因此他们妄想他们由于妒忌而受不到重视，最后时间会给他们带来人们对他们的重视」，并不是句子前面部分依存的结论。它可能应该出现在句子中间。用作结尾的句子可能是「虽然他们的话不能算是真理，他们却想靠着发表似是而非的谬论而出名」。不是说这样的句子不完整，但它显然不是古典的。古典句子一旦写出来，似乎就非此不可了。

拉罗什福科的句子当然不好写，但看起来简单。作者隐藏了所有努力。约翰逊的句子显然也很难写，但它的作者将这种困难展现出来，好像举着认可个人努力的奖杯一样。

拉罗什福科的古典句子可以当作口头说出来的。只有真正的演讲大家才能即兴造出这样的句子。事实上我们感觉到，节奏如此完美的句子不可能随口说出。但它听起来是完美精炼的。如果天使说法语，听起来大概就是这样。相比之下，约翰逊的句子只能是费脑筋的写作。从它的节奏，我们听不出是某人的即兴发言。人们可以先记住这句话，然后口头上复述出来，就算这样，听着还是像背诵书面文字，而不像讲话。约翰逊的句子背后的观念是，写作是一件既困难又崇高的事情，因为真相是作者煞费苦心获得的奖励，无法在即兴发言中捕捉到。而拉罗什福科的句子背后的观念是，即使写得精彩，也应该看起来简单。真相是苦心经营后仅存的一丝优雅。表达真相的语言是完美优雅的。

拉罗什福科的句子是古典风格的典范之作。与古典风格相关的概念环境和语言环境纷繁复杂。没有一篇古典文本能涵盖全部要素，典范之作也做不到。列出任何一条标准都无法全面涵盖：有些文本虽不具备古典风格的核心特征但显然是古典风格；另一些文本通篇没有明显的古典风格痕迹；有些文本的个别片段是明显的古典风格；有些文本只包含古典风格的少许要素；有些明显不是古典风格的文本却具备古典风格的特征；有些文本的语言特征是古典风格，背后的观念跟古典风格一点关系都没有；有些文本介于古典风格和其他风格之间。

看看平实风格和古典风格之间的过渡界限。「真相纯粹且简单」（The truth is pure and simple）是平实风格。「真相很少纯粹，也绝不简单」6（The truth is rarely pure, and never simple）是古典风格。平实风格的句子包含许多古典风格元素，却不是古典风格；古典风格的句子包含平实风格的全部元素，却不是平实风格。

古典风格认定平实风格是前提条件。平实风格的句子经过提炼、限定和琢磨，可以变成古典风格。古典风格的态度是它优于平实风格，因为古典风格以展示智慧的方式展示智慧：机智风趣地闪现，而非束手束脚地一本正经。古典风格作者想区别于他人，因为他认为尽管人人都可能知道真相，但真相不是普通大众共同享有的财富，也无法通过不经提炼的一般方式观察或表达。古典风格作者认为常识只是一种粗略认识，这种认识未经检验和提炼，可能是错的。平实风格作者希望大众化，因为他认为真相是大众的共同财富，可以用一般方式直接观察和表达。对平实风格作者来说，常识就是真相。与平实风格不同，古典风格是贵族风格，这不是说要人为限制，因为任何人都可以通过学习古典风格成为贵族的一员。只要想学，任何人都能学会古典风格，但古典风格本身是一种脑力成果，而不是一种天赋异禀。

除了句子简单优雅、思想精炼，古典风格还有很多其他特征。这些特征源自对真相和语言、作者和读者的立场，这种立场复杂、优雅又迷人。在本篇，我们会尝试阐明古典风格的特征及其隐含的概念立场。
