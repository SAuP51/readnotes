[I]l est impossible qu'avec tant de vérité, je ne vous persuade mon innocence.

[It is impossible that with such truth I should fail to persuade you of my innocence.]

Elle lui parla avec tant d'assurance, et la vérité se persuade si aisément lors même qu'elle n'est pas vraisemblable, que M. de Clèves fut presque convaincu de son innocence.

[She spoke to him with such assurance, and truth so easily persuades even where it is improbable, that Monsieur de Clèves was nearly convinced of her innocence.]

— Madame de Lafayette, La princesse de Clèves

Both of the selections from La princesse de Clèves come from a scene in which the princess is attempting to persuade her husband on his deathbed that she has not been unfaithful to him. Although she is not disinterested, the scene remains classic because the princess — an exceptional character with a disciplined and religious devotion to truth — is governed by a respect for truth and not by her interests. We include these passages because they illustrate the classic conception of truth and because they explicitly connect that conception of truth to persuasion.

The conviction that truth persuades easily even when it contradicts appearances almost certainly belongs to Madame de Lafayette herself, not just to the narrator of her most famous novel. It is not a view idly held by a naïve person. Madame de Lafayette was an intimate of Henrietta of England, Louis XIV's sister-in-law, and enjoyed exceptional access to the king. Although the details remain obscure, she was actively involved in political questions — exceptionally so for a woman. She lobbied the French court on behalf of the dowager duchess of Savoy and, through her, kept the French informed of Duke Amadeus's secret policy decisions. After the death of Henrietta in 1670, she retired from court citing ill health, but powerful members of the court continued to visit her in Paris for years afterward. She dined at the king's table in 1672 to celebrate the treaty of Versailles, and retained a strong influence with his minister Louvois. She had seen dozens of reputations made and destroyed by intrigue and had an extraordinary sense of how powerful an apparently disinterested presentation could be. She had a reputation for respecting truth and for despising people who, from weakness, tried to evade unpleasant truths.

The kind of persuasion that interested her most was the persuasion of private conversation. It happens, as in the passages cited here from her novel, that prejudice, interest, or passion may prevent truth from being accepted. But in her conception, as in the princess's, truth is naturally persuasive, so much so that even against appearances, it will carry conviction with any unbiased listener. It was this principle upon which she built a career that any modern political lawyer or lobbyist could envy.

We would naturally suspect the scene of being unclassic, because the princess is clearly interested, but she takes the classic pose that the highest and governing motive is truth, whatever immediate pressures she may feel. As she says,「J'avoue que les passions peuvent me conduire; mais elles ne sauraient m'aveugler.」‘i admit that passions can lead me, but they do not have the power to blind me.' We cannot control our interests — we lack the power always to be in a situation of disinterest — but those interests do not have to govern our actions, even if it takes an extraordinary discipline to discount them. Ordinarily, we do not trust someone who claims to be acting apart from his interests. It is for this reason that Madame de Lafayette has taken such pains to establish the exceptional fidelity to discipline in the princess as a character. Once the character has been established both by summary and by event, it is possible to believe that despite the pressures of interest, her actions are governed by the classic motive of truth. This motive, despite the temptations of self-interest, can govern the actions of anyone willing to submit to exceptional discipline. When a reader is persuaded that someone who could be affected by self-interest is in fact acting on truth, the classic concept that truth, no matter how unlikely, carries its own persuasive force can have an overwhelming effect.

Persuasion in the classic conception is the mere establishment of a classic scene in which truth definitively supersedes all actual or possible motives of interest. A speaker in a situation of interest who can establish this scene through whatever means has overcome the countervailing presumption that people are always governed by interest.

In general, it may be true that people are governed by interest, but it does not follow that everyone in all cases is governed by interest. The classic writer governed by truth belongs then to an aristocracy — an aristocracy open to anyone willing to submit to the discipline of classic style.

Hardy was something of a Turing of an earlier generation; he was another ordinary English homosexual atheist, who just happened to be one of the best mathematicians in the world.

— Andrew Hodges, Alan Turing: The Enigma

The study of history would be unnecessary for political education if the lessons to be drawn from great historic events could be summed up in a few trenchant sentences. We would then need no more than these final sentences. But political prudence does not consist in recipes which can be conveyed: it is a virtue which has to be acquired the hard way. The greatest possible economy of effort is achieved if a very competent guide takes you through the important experiences of others. He tells you just enough and not too much: why this step was taken and how it turned out to be disastrous. It is for you to think out why it turned out to be disastrous and how it might have been avoided: it is only by such personal speculation that one gains political education; in that realm, as in all others, one only learns by thinking for oneself.

— Bertrand de Jouvenel,「Introduction」to the Thomas Hobbes translation of Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War

There is an unargued assertion within Hodges's sentence, although one that is not controversial: in his lifetime G. H. Hardy was one of the best mathematicians in the world. There is also a tacit claim here that is a little more pointed: great mathematicians may be quite ordinary in other respects. Finally there is a disguised assertion that neither homosexuality nor atheism is an abnormality, either in such special populations as great mathematicians or in the population at large.

Both Hardy, Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics at Cambridge, who died at seventy — a year after a botched suicide attempt — in 1947, and Alan Turing, convicted sex criminal sentenced to a hormonal「cure,」who committed suicide at forty-two in 1954, lived in a time and place that regarded both homosexuality and atheism as shocking abnormalities, neither of which ordinarily was associated with any form of eminence.

Hodges, who is both a mathematician and an active critic of the medical model of homosexuality, gives a devastating selection of examples illustrating British concepts of homosexuality in Turing's lifetime and the effects they had on the lives of homosexuals. His book certainly encourages some ways of thinking about the subject and discourages others, but it does so by using resources of classic style. The power of the book derives not mainly from overt argument, but from the invisible argument of presentation.

This sort of invisible argument attempts neither to show the inadequacies of other opinions nor to offer explicit support for its own. It depends almost exclusively on showing the reader where to look. Hodges, in this passage, seeks to place his readers in a certain perspective; he asks them to line up「homosexual atheist」with「great mathematician.」There are people who might be so horrified by「homosexual atheist」that the last thing they would think to associate with such a description is「great mathematician.」But Hodges neither pontificates nor condescends. He speaks as if, of course, his reader knows, as well as he does, that an atheist homosexual can be an ordinary Englishman as well as a great mathematician.

At first the passage from Bertrand de Jouvenel may seem to be similar to the passage from Hodges. Jouvenel, like Hodges, asserts rather than engaging in grinding step-by-step argument, but the assertions are not just presented as truths that the reader will recognize as a matter of course. Jouvenel's writing is not tortured, but it does not have the ring of spontaneous speech, either. His assertions are made as if they were the beginning of an argument, even though no argument follows. The passage departs from the model scene and cast of classic style. The scene is not a conversation between equals; it is the scene of professor to sophomore. The writer prides himself on having come through difficulties to the wisdom he has earned and asks his readers to accept what he says because he knows more than they do, not because they can verify what he says by sharing his perspective. What he says is plausible and well expressed, but it is really a form of pontificating. The style is not classic, although the sentences are fine, and lead to a nice, if unearned, generalization.

The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.

Understanding a people's culture exposes their normalness without reducing their particularity.

[N]othing is more certain, than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions, depends on their conciseness.

— Alexander Pope,「Design」for An Essay on Man

There is nothing immediate or「natural」in contrast to what is mediate or sophisticated; there are only degrees of sophistication.

— Michael Oakeshott, Experience and Its Modes

The chronologically earliest of the five brief texts in this exhibit was written in the seventeenth century, the latest in the twentieth. Written in different cultures, for different purposes, even in different languages, they appear in quite different sorts of works, yet they share a family resemblance. Each is built around a fine but「simple」and — once formulated — inevitable distinction.

They all take the stand of noticing, as if casually, something that the reader too can notice, once his attention is properly directed. The reader has the pleasure of being able to「verify」what each writer claims, although in each case there is a refinement of commonplace observation that amounts to novelty.

Wilde suffuses his most famous play, The Importance of Being Earnest, with the attitude that plain style's conception of truth is fundamentally wrong. He takes the central verbal cliché of plain style — truth is pure and simple — and refines it. Oakeshott, although not working from a specific verbal cliché, similarly introduces a conceptual refinement, one transforming crude polar categories into degrees along a gradient. Geertz takes two clichés of ethnography — to expose is to reduce; to see normality is to miss particularity — and recasts their terms into a specific and refined four-way balance. La Rochefoucauld takes conditions normally conceived of as distinct — belonging to a category versus striving to belong — and observes their inseparability in the case of becoming established in「the world,」where appearance is so nearly everything that careful imitation of a social state is an effective way of achieving it. Pope, a master of the phrase that illustrates its own meaning, reconsiders the crude opposition of force to grace and makes the fine observation that they share a common source in conciseness.

Neither Geertz nor Pope explicitly rejects an established verbal cliché, but each tacitly rejects a conceptual commonplace without making a fuss about it. Geertz implicitly rejects the notion that to expose a culture is to make it like all the rest, and Pope actually demonstrates that grace and force are not mutually exclusive. In each case, the effect is something like that of a brilliant move in chess; it was there all along and seems inevitable once made, but to see it in the first instance requires an uncommon refinement of perception.

You imagine what you desire; you will what you imagine; and at last, you create what you will.

— Bernard Shaw, the serpent speaking to Eve in Back to

Methuselah

The thought expressed in this passage has three steps. They are schematically identical. In each, an activity is located and then linked to its source in a different activity. There is a sentence expressing each step. Each of these sentences inherits the schematic structure of the thought, as in「You imagine what you desire.」Paired activities are expressed as paired clauses — 「you imagine」and「you desire」 — and the conceptual link between paired activities is mirrored in the linguistic link between paired clauses.

These three steps are not independent, but are ordered as a temporal sequence in which the product of one step serves as the source of the next. The grammatical structure mirrors this conceptual sequence: three sentences of the same grammatical form occur in linear order; the clause referring to the product in one sentence serves to refer to the source in the next.

Shaw's passage — with its precise and detailed combination of schematic images — is the result of conceptual and linguistic work, but the work is not exhibited. Reading the sentence is like watching a champion gymnast perform a routine on the parallel bars. Obviously the gymnastic performance is the result of previous work, but only the achievement is exhibited.

The achievement is final. In the classic view, thought comes first and language is sufficient to express it. Any problem of expression has an exact solution in the language, and this solution, once found, will appear to be obvious, perfect, and definitive. The writer knows when he has finished revising.

Perfection of phrasing in classic style is assumed to follow from precision of preceding thought. The classic writer draws precise conceptual distinctions and locates exact conceptual relations until the analysis is finished. He then expresses the result of this analysis. Its schematic conceptual structure is mirrored in the schematic linguistic structure. Often, the result appears to be something like a mathematical formulation.

In classic style, the goal of analysis is truth in its most efficient form consistent with accuracy. Expression, carrying the elegance that comes from compressed energy, is like a perfectly tuned stringed instrument: the strings are taut to exact degrees to correspond to exact pitches that stand in exact relations to one another. The pitches and their relations exist before the strings are tuned. Each string is tuned to a pitch and the results are judged by comparison to this pre-existing reality. A musician tuning an instrument is not finished until everything is exactly right, but once it is exactly right, there is simply nothing left to do.

Similarly, in the classic view, the thought exists before the expression, and the expression is judged by comparing it with the pre-existing thought. In writing a sentence, a writer knows when he has it exactly right, after which there is nothing left to do.

Shaw's sentence knows when to stop because it expresses a complete analysis. It might be contrasted with the following passage — written by an editor for the influential journal he edits — which isn't over even when it is over.

The concept of spatial form has unquestionably been central to modern criticism not only of literature but of the fine arts and of language and of culture in general. Indeed, the consistent goal of the natural and human sciences in the twentieth century has been the discovery and/or construction of synchronic structural models to account for concrete phenomena.

Classic style is not exclusive. A writer's position or status cannot make her a classic writer, or bar her from becoming a classic writer. An undergraduate at a junior college wrote the following classic passage in her discussion of the spatial form of Rembrandt's Old Man with a Gold Chain:

Rembrandt was a very young man when he painted this picture, but it is a work demonstrating the insight and wisdom of an older man. It is a poignant picture and painful to look upon because it is not just a painting of a man, but an expression of mortality.

. . . l'amour-propre & la confiance en nous-mêmes, qu'il sait si bien nous inspirer, nous sollicitent à tirer des conséquences qui ne dérivent pas immédiatement des faits; en sorte que nous sommes en quelque façon intéressés à nous séduire nous-mêmes.

[. . . self-love and self-confidence (which so easily inspires us) tempt us to draw consequences that do not derive immediately from facts; so that we become in a fashion interested in deceiving ourselves.]

— Antoine Laurent Lavoisier,「Discours préliminaire」to Traité élémentaire de chimie

On n'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureux qu'on s'imagine.

[One is never so happy or unhappy as one thinks.]

 — François VI, duc de La Rochefoucauld, Maximes

Car il me semblait que je pourrais rencontrer beaucoup plus de vérité dans les raisonnements que chacun fait touchant les affaires qui lui importent, et dont l'événement le doit punir bientôt après s'il a mal jugé, que dans ceux que fait un homme de lettres dans son cabinet, touchant des spéculations qui ne produisent aucun effect, et qui ne lui sont d'autre conséquence, sinon que peut-être il en tirera d'autant plus de vanité qu'elles seront plus éloignées du sens commun. . . .

[For it seemed to me that I could find a great deal more truth in the reasonings everyone makes concerning his own affairs, and whose consequences will quickly make him suffer if he has made a mistake, than in those made by a man of letters in his study, concerning speculations that have no effect whatever, and no consequence for him except perhaps to allow him to feel prouder according as they are further from common sense. . . .]

— René Descartes, Discours de la méthode

. . . la puissance de bien juger et distinguer le vrai d'avec le faux, qui est proprement ce qu'on nomme le bon sens ou la raison, est naturellement égale en tous les hommes; et ainsi, que la diversité de nos opinions ne vient pas de ce que les uns sont plus raisonnable que les autres, mais seulement de ce que nous conduisons nos pensées par diverses voies, et ne considérons pas les mêmes choses. Car ce n'est pas assez d'avoir l'esprit bon, mais le principal est de l'appliquer bien. Les plus grandes âmes sont capables des plus grands vices aussi bien que des plus grandes vertus, et ceux qui ne marchent que fort lentement peuvent avancer beaucoup d'avantage, s'ils suivent toujours le droit chemin, que ne font ceux qui courent, et qui s'en éloignent.

[. . . the power to judge well and to distinguish the true from the false, which is properly what one calls common sense or reason, is naturally equal in everyone; and thus the diversity of our opinions does not come from some of us being more reasonable than others, but only from our conducting our thoughts in different ways and not considering the same things. For it is not enough to have a sound mind but the principal point is to apply it well. The greatest souls are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues, and those who walk only very slowly can get much further ahead if they always keep to the right way than those who run in another direction.]

 — René Descartes, Discours de la méthode

This juxtaposition of classic French texts — from chemistry, philosophy, and the observation of human behavior — very nearly speaks for itself. While everyone is endowed with reason, everyone's reason is compromised by self-deception and self-interest. Classic thought depends upon finding a way, through discipline, of avoiding these frailties and avoiding, too, pride at having avoided them. This is of course impossible.

The self cannot be escaped, but it can be, with ingenuity and hard work, distracted.

— Donald Barthelme,「Daumier」

Classic style lends itself to the expression of a complete temperament in a single statement. People who do not like this style think of this feature as a narrowness, a sameness that falls into routine or self-parody; people who admire the style think of its aphoristic character as a consistency that is something like integrity. Barthelme's sentence is much more than a statement or an observation. It is the expression of an attitude toward life. It is like the autobiography of a temperament in miniature. Its subject is central to the temperament in question — the self, conceived as a sort of cage. Naturally, someone in a cage would like to get out, but the first clause assures us there is no escape. Curiously, this situation leads neither to despair nor to passivity but to action. For,「with hard work and ingenuity,」the victim of selfhood can achieve if not the ideal goal then the most desirable practical alternative. It is a rather bleak picture of the world, but one in which there is a surprising reason to value effort and skill.

This temperament is at odds with the temperament found in Jefferson or Descartes, neither of whom begins with a restriction on basic human possibilities. Temperaments of resignation similar to Barthelme's can be found, however, in a few notable classic French writers of the seventeenth century. La Rochefoucauld, for example, assumes that there are fundamental restrictions on basic human possibilities: self-knowledge is unavailable and the knowledge one has of others, if correct, always reveals them to be acting from self-interest. La Rochefoucauld's maxim「On n'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureux qu'on s'imagine」(One is never as happy or as unhappy as one imagines) expresses a temperament resigned to unalterable restrictions on human possibilities.

Barthelme's thought is globally structured by a schematic movement to a goal, in two impulses: a failed step toward an ideal goal — marked as impossible — and a subsequent step to a substitute. The first impulse is desire, the second, acceptance. The second impulse is interrupted right before it comes to its expected end by a consideration of the unanticipated and quite difficult requirements for attaining this inferior but possible goal.

The sentence imitates the schematic form of the thought it expresses: it moves directly toward a goal to be rejected (escape) and then moves from the rejected goal toward the available goal (distraction). Grammatically, we expect a participle to follow「can be.」

But the sentence takes an unexpected grammatical detour, through a parenthesis. This grammatical detour creates a sense of the distraction to which the end of the sentence refers.

Inserting the parenthesis「with ingenuity and hard work」into the final verb phrase destroys the symmetry of a radical version of this sentence:「The self cannot be escaped, but it can be distracted.」Adding this nuance suggests a distinction between the fantasy of escape and the arduous work of distraction. Escape, because it is impossible, is not burdened with conditions. Distraction belongs to a different order of things, an order neither so desirable nor so uncomplicated as the order of fantasy.

In the classic view, truth comes with structure that is part of its meaning and is preferably to be inherited by its expression. The structure of expression is therefore, by this inheritance, meaningful — two grammatically equivalent expressions can have different meanings. Let us consider two such expressions:

The self cannot be escaped, but it can be, with ingenuity and hard work, distracted.

The self cannot be escaped, but with ingenuity and hard work it can be distracted.

The first has a schematic structure of derailment, delay, distraction, and arduousness in reaching a goal. It inherits this structure from the thought it expresses. The second does not have this schematic structure. The difference is only a nuance, but the nuance is indispensable.

Classic style is highly attentive to nuance, and as a consequence is highly sensitive to the schematic structure of expression. In the classic view, nuance is neither arbitrary nor decorative; it is meaning. Nuance is recognized through discipline and precision and can be lost sight of through carelessness. Classic style lives on fine distinctions. However fine they may be, their significance is absolute. Two things that are almost the same are in fact different, and classic style was invented as an instrument for presenting such careful discriminations.

Classic expression presents the simplest accurate result of analysis. It presupposes that an analysis has been completed, and it is distinguished by expressing the result in the simplest accurate form. The thought locates exact distinctions, exact relations, exact objects and forms; the expression presents this analyzed array. The expression is clear and simple as the truth, but no clearer or simpler. Barthelme's sentence is classic in expressing a precise analysis. It does this clearly and simply without blurring the fine distinctions indispensable to the thought.

They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do.

— Philip Larkin, from「This Be The Verse」in High Windows

These two sentences, here set out as prose, are the first two lines of a twelve-line poem. Although Larkin uses conventional poetic forms of meter and rhyme, he imparts to his poetry the sound of talk — casual, spontaneous, conversational. His best poetry not only aspires to, but achieves the condition of classic prose.

His first line,「They fuck you up, your mum and dad,」sounds like a conversational observation; the words seem to be as commonplace as the thought, but they unobtrusively give vitality back to the cliché they express. The observation crystallizes a vast and indefinite history of personal experience without incorporating any of it, and the reader is expected to be able to confirm the truth immediately from her own experience.

His next line,「They may not mean to, but they do,」sounds like an afterthought. In fact, it is an example of the writer doing all the work invisibly. Larkin deliberately avoids the surface brilliance of classic writers such as La Rochefoucauld, or Shaw, or Wilde, preferring instead the maximum understatement of his capacity and labor — on a casual reading, their very existence can go unsuspected. These lines are however a deliberate presentation after the writer has done quite a lot of invisible work. Try any alternative — 「your mum and dad fuck you up even if they don't mean to,」for example — and see how flat and unmemorable this unforgettable little text becomes.

We can begin to see how careful and studied this passage actually is, despite its deceptively casual presentation, if we consider Larkin's choice of words. A moment's reflection will establish that your mum and dad are not the same as your mother and father or your mommy and daddy or dad and mom. The phrase「mum and dad」is a set phrase used to refer to parents as they inhabit a particular role with respect to their children. A native speaker of English, particularly British English, knows exactly when and under what circumstances to use this phrase, but the amount and variety of this knowledge is vast. It is the perfect phrase for referring to parents in Larkin's text because it is precisely in their capacity as「mum and dad」that they「fuck you up.」The language has supplied a perfect phrase for crystallizing the extraordinarily complicated normal history wherein parents not deficient as parents nonetheless routinely, predictably, and inevitably debilitate their children.「They may not mean to, but they do.」

Profanity is almost never encountered in classic prose, exactly because the usual reasons for using it are unclassic. It is rarely a precise instrument of presentation and often has the effect of slurring or smudging an observation. The nonstandard「mum and dad,」the vulgar「fuck you up」exceptionally in this text fit their subject precisely. As a result, the expression itself, while disguised as commonplace, is unstridently memorable and undeniably certified by the culture whose artifacts are these phrases.

The novels of Theodore Dreiser, Marxist political rhetoric, the landscape of northern New Jersey, souvenir shops in airports — these have the special qualities of an ugly which is at once settled into itself, varied in its particulars, yet bound to go on and on interminably.

— Robert Martin Adams, Bad Mouth

Mme de Chevreuse avait beaucoup d'esprit, d'ambition et de beauté; elle était galante, vive, hardie, entreprenante; elle se servait de tous ses charmes pour réussir dans ses desseins, et elle a presque toujours porté malheur aux personnes qu'elle y a engagées.

[Madame de Chevreuse had sparkling intelligence, ambition, and beauty in plenty; she was flirtatious, lively, bold, enterprising; she used all her charms to push her projects to success, and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way.]

— La Rochefoucauld, Mémoires

When La Rochefoucauld wrote his description of Madame de Chevreuse, Theodore Dreiser had written no novels, there was no Marxist political rhetoric, the landscapes of northern New Jersey were unexplored by English professors, there were no souvenir shops in airports, there were no airports. He and Robert Martin Adams are each saturated in local knowledge of a certain kind, but they live in different worlds and speak of different things. Yet their observations share a great deal if we consider not what they have to say but how they arrange what they say.

Each of them builds carefully to a point, a point known from the beginning but reserved and prepared for so that it will achieve its maximum effect without seeming to be forced. Each of them assumes a pose of abundant and assured experience from which he speaks. They succeed in turning away the normal temptation to question their unargued judgments because they do not betray any anxiety by overstatement. Adams is disarming in suggesting that he is familiar with not just this kind of ugly but other varieties as well. It is as if the question of these things being ugly is settled; he is concerned only to make sure he has placed them in the right category of ugly.

La Rochefoucauld succeeds in suggesting that he has a wide acquaintance among women, some of them attractive, others talented or ambitious, none of them quite like Madame de Chevreuse. Both La Rochefoucauld and Adams speak from a secure haven. Adams is not threatened by the bleak and eternal ugly he delineates; La Rochefoucauld will not be enlisted in any of Madame de Chevreuse's projects. Their position of safety suggests that they have no urgent interest in getting their readers to believe what they say, and this implicit claim is supported by the structure and tone of the sentences themselves.

Adams's sentence has a musing tone to it and certainly his own expression has not been invaded by any variety of the ugly. La Rochefoucauld is not eager to say anything negative about Madame de Chevreuse; there is a tone of appreciation and equity to his description. The proven danger of associating with her does not subtract from her attractive qualities, which are abundant andnot commonly united in a single person. Consider how different the effect would be if he had said,「Even though Madame de Chevreuse was beautiful, intelligent, . . .」

While neither of these sentences expresses the least doubt and both make positive, unshaded judgments that might court a reader's resistance, they distract resistance by making the sort of fine distinctions that are the expression of serene, unrushed judgment. Such distinctions cannot be made casually; they are the result of work, observation, testing — something like research. None of this effort is allowed to show, however, in the expression; even the writing is made to sound easy. Neither writer suggests that he has considered ways of disarming a reader's impulse to question, although each of them has anticipated problems and devised solutions.

Although each word has been carefully weighed and carefully placed, the finished sentences suggest spontaneous speech. It is only on reflection that we see how impossible it would be for someone spontaneously to say something so complex and perfect. (Almost any change in either sentence would be a change for the worse.) Neither writer wants to suggest that what he is doing is work. That is why so much work has gone into getting this writing to suggest speech; writing suggests effort and work, persuasive writing suggests strategy. To make writing imitate speech is a great deal of work and yet the happy phrase that is just right and suggests that it is just right simply because it is true can happen in conversation — usually after a lot of forgotten false starts.

All these shared characteristics are what makes it possible to see these sentences as stylistically similar, even though they do not share a subject or even a language.

A heroic, photographically literal statue of [Huey Long] stands on a high pedestal above his grave in the Capitol grounds. The face impudent, porcine and juvenal, is turned toward the building he put up — all thirty-four stories of it — in slightly more than a year, mostly with Federal money. The bronze double-breasted jacket, tight over the plump belly, has already attained the dignity of a period costume, like Lincoln's frock coat. In bronze, Huey looks like all the waggish fellows from Asheville and Nashville, South Bend and Topeka, who used to fill our costlier speakeasies in the late twenties and early thirties. He looks like a golf-score-and-dirty-joke man, anxious for the good opinion of everybody he encounters. Seeing him there made me feel sad and old. A marble Pegasus carved in bas-relief below his feet bears a scroll that says,「Share Our Wealth.」That was one of Huey's slogans; another was「Every Man a King.」

— A. J. Liebling, The Earl of Louisiana

In this last chapter I wish to observe and trace the transformation of American Africanism from its simplistic, though menacing, purposes of establishing hierarchic difference to its surrogate properties as self-reflexive meditations on the loss of the difference, to its lush and fully blossomed existence in the rhetoric of dread and desire.

— Toni Morrison, Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination

Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, in a New York Times review of Toni Morrison's essay Playing in the Dark and her novel Jazz, cited this sentence as an example of the essay's style, which he contrasted with what he called the poetry of her novel. He expressed disapproval of「the style she employs to make her points.」His tacit and conventional assumption, almost an enabling convention in journalism, is that style is completely separable from thought. Morrison, accordingly, should have presented her thought in a more immediately intelligible style. This is the same assumption that underwrites the many programs for correcting prose by giving its surface a final jiggle to shake out blemishes and clots.

The difficulty in Morrison's sentence lies not in its surface but in its thought. The image-schematic structure of the sentence — spatial movement along a path from location to location — is basic and classic. Here is an immediately intelligible sentence formed on that image schema:

I want to observe and trace the history of Christianity as it moved from its origin as a Jewish heresy, to the state religion of the Roman Empire, to the high religion of medieval Europe.

Combined with this image schema is a basic metaphor: ideas, beliefs, and institutions — which are not physical objects and which do not move — can be understood metaphorically as physical objects that do move; different states are metaphorically different locations; transformation is metaphorically movement from one spatial location to another; the history of an idea, a belief, or an institution can be「followed」by「tracing」visually the「path」「traced」by its「movement」in historical time. Morrison's sentence and the sentence about Christianity are equally built upon this union of metaphor and image schema. But the sentence about Christianity is immediately intelligible while Morrison's is not. The difference lies in the conception of subject.

Classic style conceives of its subject, whether concrete or abstract, as a publicly available「thing」clear and distinct at all levels — from anatomy to fine detail. This cultural「thing」can be acknowledged by any competent observer who looks at it. Its existence is independent of the writer's conception and certainly independent of the writer's prose. A subject conceived of in this way as a「thing」fits nicely the image schema of spatial movement and the metaphor of change as spatial movement.

Even if a reader cannot offer any precise description of Christianity, and may be barely able to distinguish it from Buddhism, it will be acknowledged by most likely readers of The New York Times — and certainly by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt — as if it were observable in the same sense that the statue of Huey Long on the Capitol grounds in Baton Rouge is observable.「American Africanism,」unlike Christianity, calls attention to itself as an abstraction precisely because it does not have the sort of agreed-about borders, however imprecise, that a concept needs before it leaves the status of special conception intelligible to special audiences and becomes a vulgar cliché indistinguishable for rhetorical purposes from a planet whose path can be traced.

A similar difficulty attaches to the three stages of American Africanism's history, all of which are unfamiliar abstractions, none of which has general currency in contemporary American culture.「Medieval Europe」is also an abstraction, but it has general currency; a reader of The New York Times can be expected to accept such an abstraction as definite and legitimate even if that reader's image of medieval Europe is completely featureless, since such a reader will believe he could, so to speak, look it up.「The rhetoric of dread and desire」does not enjoy a similar standing, so that the lush and fully blossomed existence of American Africanism in the rhetoric of dread and desire is an existence that cannot be accepted as a matter of course.

Morrison is not offering arbitrarily difficult descriptions of what can be described in「another style,」that is, more accessible language. She is talking about special concepts without common currency whose very existence depends on her thought. As a result, the passage features an asymmetry between writer and reader that marks her style as unclassic. A writer presenting such a subject in classic style could not trace a movement before establishing the reality of American Africanism down to quite fine details, so that the reader can accept it as a「thing」he can experience. The model scene would have to be substituted unobtrusively for an actual scene of persuasion, and the classic writer would have to persuade his reader that she can accept American Africanism the way she can accept the planet Venus, and that the path of American Africanism can be traced the way an astronomer can trace the planet's path. The abstract nature of the subject is no impediment to such a conception: a cultural historian like Chastel, a connoisseur of old painting like Friedländer, a New Testament interpreter like Dodd, a mathematical physicist like Feynman, an observer of the emotions like Madame de Lafayette, and an observer of society like Madame de Sévigné can present the most abstract matters in the most abstract fields as if they were talking about statues, strawberries, or the evening star.

The passage from A. J. Liebling describing the statue of Huey Long may seem at first glance to have nothing in common with the passage from Toni Morrison. Morrison is talking about a cultural abstraction and its sequence of change; Liebling is talking about a static statue that anyone standing at Huey Long's grave can see. The juxtaposition of these passages may suggest an attempt to illustrate the advice of so many writing manuals to be「concrete,」and to avoid abstractions. It is, of course, impossible either to think or write without using abstractions, so like most scattershot advice, the mantra「be concrete, avoid abstractions」is generally useless in practice. The mantra is nevertheless at least remotely related to a sound observation about style, in the way, for example, that the phrase「you can't be certain of anything」is related to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

Liebling's description of Huey Long's statue turns on concepts about American culture in the 1920s and 1930s that are as abstract as anything in Toni Morrison's passage and are at least as personal to Liebling as anything Morrison says about the movement of American Africanism is personal to her. The stylistic difference between them rests on how they treat those abstractions. It is easy to feel excluded from Morrison's vision of American Africanism because she does not choose to conceive of her subject as a「thing」that anyone can verify. As a result, the abstract nature of her concepts is put into relief, and she leaves the reader with the choice of either accepting what she says or considering it, to a greater or lesser degree, an arbitrarily personal vision.

Liebling demonstrates a typical classic elision from what is easy for any reader to see for herself — the statue — to his highly personal interpretation, based on abstract cultural and ethical concepts. He never says that anyone else can see the cultural matrix into which he places the statue; he treats that matrix as a matter of course and suggests that its finest details can be delineated by anyone who was there. As a result, it requires deliberate analysis to realize that while anyone can verify the existence of the statue and the inscription on the scroll (「Share Our Wealth」), the interpretation that has been slipped between the description of the statue and the description of the scroll can be seen by no one who does not agree to accept Liebling's reflection as a thing. This agreement, Liebling recognizes, requires persuasion, but he never explicitly acknowledges a need to persuade. Instead, he addresses his problem by artful juxtaposition and tacit assurances that what he supplies (whether fact or interpretation) is as reliable as what is right there in front of him and — accidents of time and place aside — can be right there in front of you. Consider the comparison between「Share Our Wealth,」the slogan actually carved on the scroll, and「Every Man a King,」which Liebling cites as another of Huey Long's slogans. The second slogan is nowhere to be seen at the gravesite, but it is one of Huey Long's best-known lines. Liebling's claim can be verified by anyone who checks the relevant sources. It is only an invisible step to treat the interpretation as something that can be verified in the relevant sources too, and it is a classic technique to distract the reader from observing that the relevant source in this case is the writer's imagination.

0501 古典论证

呈现即论证

选段 5-1

有了这个真相，我不可能还说服不了你相信我的清白。

她跟他说话的语气如此笃定，即使是看起来不大可能的真相也很容易让人信服，以至克莱夫芙先生几乎相信她的清白。

—— 拉法耶特夫人，《克莱芙王妃》1

以上两个选段均选自《克莱芙王妃》里的场景，王妃在她丈夫临终前试图说服丈夫相信她没有背叛他。虽然她有自己的私心，但这个场景仍然是古典风格，因为王妃是一个杰出人物，对真相怀有自律又虔诚的忠诚，她的动机是尊重真相而非为己谋私。我们选入这些段落，是因为它们阐释了古典风格概念中的真相，因为它们明确将那种概念中的真相与说服关联起来。9

真相即使不是看起来那么回事，也有足够的说服力，这种坚定不仅属于她最著名的小说中的叙述者，也属于拉法耶特夫人本人。这不是一个天真的人不切实际的想法。拉法耶特夫人是路易十四的小姨子亨利埃塔的密友，而且跟国王接触密切。虽然不清楚细节，但拉法耶特夫人在改治问题上表现活跃 —— 尤其对一个女人来说。她代表萨沃伊公爵夫人游说法国法院，并通过她让法国人了解阿马德乌斯公爵的秘密政策决定。1670 年亨利埃塔去世后，拉法耶特夫人因为健康状况不佳退出了法院，但法院的实权人物随后多年继续去巴黎探访她。1672 年，她与法国国王同席用餐庆祝《凡尔赛和约》的签订，对国王的陆军大臣卢瓦依然有很大影响力。她见证了数十起因为政治阴谋声名鹊起又名誉尽毁的事件，她深刻地认识到，一种显然客观公正的陈述方式具有多么大的力量。人们都知道她素来尊重真相，也鄙视软弱之人逃避令人不快的真相。

她最喜欢的游说方式是私下对话。偏见、利益或激情或许会阻碍真相被接受，正如这里引用的她的小说段落所述那样。但在她的观念里，即小说中王妃的观念，真相具有天然的说服力，这种说服力如此强大，即使不是表面上看起来的那回事，任何一位公允的听众都会信服。正是奉行这种原则，她建立的职业生涯令所有现代政治律师或说客羡慕不已。

我们很容易怀疑这不是古典风格的场景，因为王妃显然有自己的利益考量，但她采取的姿态是，无论她可能感受到什么样的直接压力，她的最高首选动机都是真相。正如她所说：「我承认，激情可以引导我，但还没有强大到可以蒙蔽我（J'avoue que les passions peuvent me conduire, mais elles ne sauraient m'aveugler）。」

我们无法控制我们的利益 —— 我们没有能力让自己时刻保持客观中立 —— 但没必要让那些利益支配我们的行为，哪怕我们需要极大的自制力来抵制利益的诱惑。通常，我们很难相信那些声称不考虑自身利益的人。正因为如此，拉法耶特夫人才费心思为王妃这个人物塑造遵守纪律的形象。一但同时用概括和事件塑造出人物形象，读者就有可能相信，尽管有利益方面的压力，古典风格真相仍是她的最高动机。这一动机，即使可能受到个人利益的诱惑，仍然可以指导任何愿意遵守特殊纪律的人的行为。当读者相信一个可能受个人利益影响的人，实际上依据真相行事时，这种古典概念 —— 真相无论看起来多么不可能发生，都自带说服力 —— 会产生一种让人非信不可的效果。

古典概念中的说服，只是建立一个古典场景，在这个场景中，真相最终替代了所有实际或可能的利益动机。在一个牵涉利益的情境中，无论说话者用什么方式，只要能建立这种场景，就相当于打破了人总是受利益支配这个刻板印象。

总体来说，人们可能会受利益支配，但并不意味着无论在什么场合每个人都会受利益支配。尊重真相的古典风格作者则属于贵族阶层任何人只要愿意遵循古典风格的纪律，都可以成为这样的贵族。

选段 5-2

哈代是更早年代的图灵；他是另一位普通的英国同性恋无神论者，只是恰好是世界上最优秀的数学家之一。

—— 安德鲁·霍奇斯，《艾伦·图灵传 —— 如谜的解谜者》2

如果用几句犀利的话就能总结伟大历史事件的教训，那么研究历史对于政治教有来说就没有必要了。我们只需要几句总结的活就行了。但政治上的严谨，并不是口头可以传授的：它是一种必须付出吸辛才能获得的品质。一本好的指南如果能够带你领略其他人的重要经历，那么它就能为你省下很多心力。它只是告诉你最需要知道的，不会告诉你太多：比如为什么采取这一步，这一步如何让事情变成灾难。你需要自己去思考，为什么它变成了灾难性的事情，如何做可以避免一只有自己去判断，一个人才能获得政治教育；在那个领域，像所有其他领域一样，只有独立思考，才能学到东西。

—— 伯纳德·德·茹弗内尔，修昔底德《伯罗奔尼搬战争史》

托马斯·霍布斯译本「序言」3

霍奇斯的句子有一条不容辩驳的断言，虽然本身无可争议：在他所处的时代，G. H. 哈代是世界上最优秀的数学家之一。还有另一条更有观点的隐含断言：伟大的数学家在其他方面可能相当普通。最后一条不易察觉的断言是：无论对伟大的数学家这些特殊群体而言，还是对整个群体而言，同性恋或无神论者没有什么不正常的。

哈代是剑桥大学教授纯粹数学的萨德菜里恩（Sadleirian）讲座教授，于自杀未遂之后的那一年（1947）年逝世，享年 70 岁；艾伦·图灵被指控为性罪犯，被判处荷尔蒙「治疗」，于 1954 年自杀，享年 42 岁。在他们生活的时代和地方，人们通常难以将反常的现象联想到杰出人士。

作为一名反对把同性恋当作疾病的数学家，霍奇斯选取了一些典型案例证明：在图灵生活的年代，英国人的同性恋观以及这些观念给同性恋的生活带来的影响。他的书当然会鼓励对待这种问题的某些态度，也会否定其他态度，但用了古典风格的策略来表明自己的观点。这本书的力量不在于作者公开地论证，而是把呈现本身当作无形的论证。

这种无形的论证，没有试图指出其他观点的不足，也没有为自己的观点据理力争。它几乎只告诉读者往哪看。在这段中，霍奇斯试图让读者处于某种视角中，让读者将「同性恋、无神论者」与「伟大的数学家」融合在一起。有些人听到「同性恋无神论者」可能会感到震惊，怎么都不可能将其和「伟大的数学家」联系起来。但霍奇斯既没有自以为是，也没有高人一等。他说得好像他的读者当然知道，正如他知道一样，一位同性恋无神论者，可以是普通的英国人，也可以是伟大的数学家。

乍看之下，伯纳德·德·茹弗内尔的选段看起来与霍奇斯的选段相似。和霍奇斯一样，茹弗内尔直接断定，而不是事无巨细地逐一论证。

但这些断言呈现的并不是读者理所当然会看到的真相。茹弗内尔的文章虽然没有曲解，但也不像即兴说话。他的断言像一段论证的开头，尽管后面并无论证。这一段话偏离了古典风格典型的场景和角色。这个场景不是同辈的对话，而是教授对大二学生的教海。作者为自己克服困难所得的智慧而自豪，让读者相信他的话，因为他比他们知道得更多，而不是因为他们站在同样的视角可以验证他说的话。他的观点看似有理，表达清楚，但实际上是某种形式的自以为是。它不是古典风格，尽管句子写得不错，也总结了一个漂亮的（不劳而获的）泛论。

选段 5-3

真相很少纯粹，也绝不简单。

—— 奥斯卡·王尔德，《不可儿戏》4

理解一个民族的文化，即在不削弱其特殊性的情况下，昭示出其常态。

—— 克利福德·格尔茨，《文化的解释》5

为了在社会上获得成功，人们就竭力做出在社会上已经成功的样子。

—— 拉罗什福科，《道德藏言录》① 6

毋庸置疑，论证或教导要想同时表现出力量和优雅，大部分取决于它们是否简洁。

—— 亚历山大·蒲柏，《人论》作者序 7

汉译文选自何怀宏翻译版本，本书其他《道德箴言录》选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

这里不存在与间接的或复杂的东西相对的直接的或「自然的」东西：在此存在的只是不同的复杂性程度而已。

—— 迈克尔·奥克肖特，《经脸及其模式》① 8

选段 5-3 中的五个短句，按照年代先后，最早的写于十七世纪，最晚的写于二十世纪。各自所处的文化不同，表达目的不同，甚至连语言也不同，它们出现在完全不同类型的作品中，但有类似的结构特点。每句话都有一个鲜明的观点，精妙而「简单」，一旦说出来，就必然如此。

它们有着相同的立场：他们看到的，好像是不经意的发现，只要正确地指出来，读者也会看到。读者非常乐意「验证」每位作者的言论，尽管每种言论是基于普通观察提炼出的新发现。

王尔德（Wilde）在他最著名的戏剧作品《不可儿戏》（The Importance of Being Earnest）中，充分表明了一种态度，即平实风格概念中的真相根本不对。他取材于平实风格常用的陈词滥调 —— 真相纯粹且简单 —— 并做了提炼。奥克肖特虽然不是用某个现成的陈词滥调，但同样做了概念提炼，将粗略的两极分化改成了由浅及深的程度变化。格尔茨提取了人种论的两种陈词滥调 —— 要彰显就得削弱，要看到常态就得失去特殊性 —— 并改写了它们的条件使其形成一种具体的四方平衡状态。拉罗什福科选择了通常被认为对立的情况 ——「属于什么样的人」对应「努力成为什么样的人」—— 并观察到二者在取得社会上的成功这方面密不可分，表象几乎是一切，以至于认真模仿某种社会状态是达到这种状态的有效方式。蒲柏的写作风格以简洁见长，用简洁证明了这个词自身的含义，他重新思考了「优雅」和「力量」这二者的简单对立，细致地发现二者都源于「简洁」。

格尔茨和蒲柏都没有正面驳斥公认的陈词滥调，但不动声色地否定了没有新意的概念。格尔茨间接反对了彰显一种文化就要让它跟所有其他文化一样的主张。而蒲柏实际上展示了优雅与力量并非相互排斥。每个例子的效果就像下象棋时的精彩一招；它自始至终都在那里，一旦决定，似乎只能这么做，但要一开始就看出来，需要不同寻常的敏锐洞察力。

意像图式

选段 5-4

你想象你所渴望之物；你寻求你所想象之物；最后，你创造你所寻求之物。

—— 萧伯钠，《千岁人》，蛇对夏娃说的话 9

选段 5-4 的思想有三个层级。它们的图式结构完全相同。每个层级都发生一项活动，这项活动又成为下面一项活动的发端。一个层级对应一句话表达。每句话都沿袭了思想的图式结构，比如「你想象你所渴望之物」这句话。活动两两一组，表达成句子也是两两一组 ——「你想象」和「你渴望」—— 组活动的概念关系反映在一组从句的语言关系中。

这三个层级并非相互独立，而是按时间顺序排列的：一个层级的末端是下一个层级的开端。这种概念顺序反映在语法结构上：三个句子语法形式相同，呈线性排列；指称一个句子末端的分句，用来指称下一个句子的发端。

萧伯纳的这段话 —— 精准贴合意象图式 —— 正是概念与语言相互匹配的结果，但这种匹配过程没有被展示出来。阅读这些句子犹如观看一位体操冠军表演一套双杠动作。显然，这套体操表演是先前训练的结果，展现给观众的只是成果。

成果是最完美的呈现。在古典视角中，思想先于语言，语言足以表达思想。任何表达问题都可以在语言中找到合适的解决方案，这种方案一旦找到，看起来理所应当、完美且无以复加。作者知道调整到什么程度才算结束。

古典风格措辞完美被认为是前期思想准确的结果。完成全部分析后古典风格作者精准区分出概念差异并确立准确的概念关系。然后他把这种分析结果表达出来。它在概念上的图式结构体现在语言的图式结构中。这种结果看起来常常像数学公式。

在古典风格中，分析的目的是找到最高效、最准确的真相。表达因言简意丰而优雅，就像一件调弦完美的弦乐器：每根琴弦拉紧到特定程度，发出特定的音高，这种音高与其他音高构成特定关系。琴弦的音高和音高间的关系在调弦之前就已存在。每根琴弦调试到各自音高后，对照这个早已存在的事实可以判断演奏的效果。乐手调试乐器直到一切都刚刚好才算完成，一旦调到刚刚好的状态，也就没什么要做的了。

同样，在古典视角中，思想先于表达存在，对照早就存在的思想可以判断表达的好坏。作者写句子，知道什么时候刚刚好，之后就没什么要做的了。

萧伯纳的句子知道什么时候结束，因为他表达了完整的分析。可以将它和下面一段话对比。这是一位编辑为他服务的一本有影响力的杂志写的，句子虽然结束了，实际却没写完。

空间形式概念无疑对现代批评极为重要，不仅是文学批译，通常还有美术批评、语言批评和文化批评。事实上，二十世纪自然科学和人文科学从始至终的目标是发现和（或）构建解释具体现象的共时结构模式。10

古典风格不是谁的专属风格。作者的地位或身份不会帮助他成为一名古典风格作者，但也不会妨碍他成为一名古典风格作者。一名本科生在讨论伦勃朗（Rembrandt）的画《戴金项链的老者》（Old Man with a Gold Chain）的空间形式时，用古典风格写出了下面这段话：

伦勃朗画这福画时还是一位非常年轻的小伙子，但这幅画晨示了一位长者的羽见和智慧。这是一福悲楚的画，看着令人痛苦，因为它不单是一张年轻人的画作，也是一种对死亡的表达。11

选段 5-5

......自负，与我们沉溺其中的自信，促使我们引出那些并非直接源于事实的各种结论：结果我们变得有几分爱好自欺。

—— 安托万-洛朗·拉瓦锡，《化学基础论》序言 ① 12

① 汉译文选自任定成翻译版本。—— 译者注

人从来不像自己想象的那么章福，也并非自已想象的那么不幸。

—— 拉罗什福科，《道德藏言录》3

因为在我看来，普通人的推理所包含的真理要比读书人的推理所包含的多得多：普通人是对切身的事情进行推理，如果判断错了，它的结果马上就会来惩罚他：读书人是关在书房里对思排的道理进行推理，思辩是不产生任何实效的，仅仅在他身上造成一种后果，就是思辨离常识越远，他由此产生的虚荣心大概就越大…...

—— 勒内·笛卡儿，《谈谈方法》14

…...那种正确判断、辦别真假的能力，也就是我们称为良知或理性的那种东西，本来就是人人均等的：我们的意见之所以有分歧，并不是由于有些人的理性多些，有些人的理性少些，而只是由于我们运用思想的途径不同，所考察的对象不是一回事。因为单有聪明才智是不够的，主要在于正确地运用才智。杰出的人才固然能够做出最大的好事，也同样可以做出最大的坏事：行动十分缓慢的人只要始终循着正道前进，就可以比离开正道飞奔的人走在前面很多。

—— 勒内·笛卡儿，《谈谈方法》5

将这些古典风格的法语文段 —— 来自化学、哲学和人类行为观察领域一放在一起看，表达的意思很明显。尽管每个人都有理性，但每个人的理性都会因为自我欺骗和个人利益而受到损害。古典思想在于通过自律避免这些弱点，同时还要避免为此沾沾自喜。这当然不可能。

选段 5-6

自我，不可能逃脱，但可以，通过才智和努力，转移对它的注意力。

—— 唐纳德·巴塞尔姆，《杜米埃》16

古典风格表达某种完整的性情只用了一句话。不喜欢这种风格的人，认为这种特点狭隘且千篇一律，容易落入俗套或自嘲中；而欣赏这种风格的人，认为它的格言特点与其所表达的思想一致，像某种完整统一的东西。巴塞尔姆的句子不仅是一种陈述或一种观察，还是一种生活态度的表达。它就像一种表达性情的自传的缩影。它的主题对表达的性情很重要 —— 自我，在文中被当作某种笼子。关在笼子里的人自然想出去，但第一个分句明确告诉我们，逃离是不可能的。有意思的是，这种情境引发的不是绝望，也不是被动，而是行动。因为。「通过才智和努力」，自我的受害者，即使无法实现理想目标，也可以实现最迫切的实际目标。这是一个相当惨淡的世界，但正是这个世界，给了你一个意外的理由去重视才智和努力。

这种性情与杰弗逊或笛卡儿表现出来的性情不一样，他们都不是从人类基本潜力的局限开始的。然而，在十七世纪一些著名的法国古典作家中，也可以发现像巴塞尔姆这样退而求其次（resignation）的性情。比如拉罗什福科，他认为人类的基本潜力存在根本的局限性：人不可能没有自知之明，而对他人的认识，如果正确，揭示出来的总是为已谋私的品性。拉罗什福科的箴言「人从来不像自己想象的那么幸福，也并非自己想象的那么不幸」（Onn'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureux quon s'imagine）表达的性情是：面对人类潜力不可改变的局限，我们只能听之任之。

巴塞尔姆的思想整体上是一种向目标运动的图式结构，有两次冲动：先前往理想目标但没成功 —— 标志着不可能实现 —— 再换成前往替代目标。第一次冲动是欲望，第二次冲动是接受。第二次冲动到达预期目标之前被中断，没想到这个可实现的次级目标要求的条件也相当因难。

这句话模仿了它要表达的思想的图式结构：它直接前往的目标（逃脱）被否定了，又从这个被否定的目标前往有可能到达的目标（转移注意力）。根据语法规则，「can be」（可以）后面应该紧邻过去分词「be distracted」（转移对它的注意力）。

但是这句话在语法上用了意想不到的迂回，在过去分词前面插了一个插入语。这种语法迂回创造了一种转移注意力的效果，这正是句子末尾所指的目标。

把插入语「通过才智和努力」（with ingenuity and hard work）插到最后一个动词短语「可以转移（对它的）注意力」（can be distracted）之中，破坏了基础句子的对称性：「自我不可能逃脱，但可以转移对它的注意力（Th self cannot be escaped, but it can be distracted）。」这个细微变化暗示逃避的幻象和转移注意力的辛苦这两者截然不同。逃脱，因为不可能做到，没有附属条件。转移注意力，属于不同类型的事物，不像幻想那样渴望，也不像幻想那样简单。

在古典风格看来，真相的结构是它的意义的一部分，而且很可能在它的表达中沿袭下来。这种沿袭为表达结构赋予了意义一两个语法对等的表达，包含的意思不同。我们看看下面的两种表达。

自我不可能逃脱，但可以，通过才智和努力，转移对它的注意力。

[The self cannot be escaped, but it can be, with ingenuity and hard work, distracted.]

自我不可能逃脱，但通过才智和务力，可以转移对它的注意力。

[The self cannot be escaped, but with ingenuity and hard work it can be distracted.]

第一种表达的图示结构：前往目标时有脱轨、延误、干扰和辛苦。它从它要表达的思想中沿袭了这种结构。第二种表达没有这样的图式结构。两种表达的差异微乎其微，但不可忽视。

古典风格非常注重细节，因此对表达的图式结构很用心。古典风格认为，细微差异不是随意为之，也不是为了装饰；它就是意义本身。只有严格要求和精益求精，才能看出细微差异，稍有马虎就很难注意到。细微差异是古典风格的精髓。不论多么细微，这些细节的意义是绝对的。两件看似几乎一样的东西，实际上不同，而古典风格专门用来呈现这些细致敏锐的差别。

古典表达呈现最简单、准确的分析结果。前提是分析已经完成，它只需用最简单准确的形式表达结果。思想会找到确切的差异、确切的关系、确切的事物和形式，表达只用把这系列的分析呈现出来。表达如真相一样清晰简单，但不能更清晰、更简单了。巴塞尔姆的句子是古典风格，在于它表达了精准的分析。句子清晰简单，却也呈现出了想要传达的思想中必不可少的细微差异。

不露声色

选段 5-7

他们槽践了你，你的爸妈。也许不是有意，但事实如此。

—— 菲利普·拉金，《高窗》① 17

① 此处参考舒丹丹的翻译，根据本书作者讨论的用词差异调整了「fuck」和「mum and dad」的翻译。原翻译为：他们搞槽了你，你妈咪和爹地。也许不是有意，但事实如此。—— 译者注







这两句话在这里排列成散文，是一首十二行诗的前两行。虽然拉金使用了传统诗歌的韵律和节奏，但他赋予了他的诗歌说话的声音 —— 随意、即兴、对话感。他最好的诗歌不仅向古典风格散文看齐，而且具备了古典散文的条件。

他的第一句话，「他们槽践了你，你的爸妈」听起来像是一边对话一边观察；这些词似乎与它们要表达的思想一样平淡无奇，它们说的是陈词滥调，但有一种不经意的新颖。这种观察萃取了大量个人经验历史，而不是抽取其中一个案例。读者可以直接参照自己的经验验证真相。

他的第二句话，「也许不是有意，但事实如此」，听起来像是补充的想法。实际上，这是作者无形中做好了所有工作。不像拉罗什福科、萧伯纳或王尔德这些古典作家，拉金故意避免显露自己的才华，而是尽可能地隐藏他的才能和努力 —— 如果读得不仔细，就可能认识不到。但这些词句是作者做了很多无形工作之后精心呈现出来的。试试别的表达比如，「你的爸妈槽践了你，即使他们不是有意」—— 可以看到本来犀利的短句变得多么平淡无奇。

如果细细体味拉金的用词，我们可以看出来这段话虽然表面上很随意，但实际上有多么细致和考究。稍想一想就能发现，「你的爸妈」（your mum and dad）和「你的父亲母亲」（your mother and father）、「你的爸爸妈妈」（your mommy and daddy）或「你的爸妈」（your dad and mum）是不一样的效果。「爸妈」是对父母的常见称呼，因为对他们的孩子来说，他们充当着特定的角色。母语为英语的人，尤其是说英式英语的人，确切地知道什么时候什么场景用这个称呼，但这个称呼有大量的变体。拉金在文中称呼父母的词非常完美，因为父母正是以「你的爸妈」身份「槽践了你」。拉金的语言用了一个完美的词汇萃取出这种极其复杂却又寻常的经历 —— 父母也不是不称职，但常常不出所料不可避免地让孩子变得更槽。「也许不是有意，但事实如此」。

脏话几乎不会出现在古典文章中，恰恰因为说脏话的事由通常不是古典风格。它很少能正确地呈现，反而常常让观察更模糊不清。不正式的「爸妈」和粗俗的「糟践了你」，在这段话中特别贴合主题。表达本身虽然显得很普通，用词低调，但令人难忘，且不容置疑，由文化孕育，自然也能由文化证实。

选段 5-8

西奥多·德莱塞的小说，马克思主义的政治修辞，新泽西州北部的景观，机场的纪念品商店 —— 这些都有一种丑陋的特质，虽然能很快融入自身，细节也各不相同，但必然会没完没了地持续下去。

—— 罗伯特·马丁·亚当斯，《说人坏话》18

谢弗勒兹夫人光芒四射，集智慧、抱负和美丽于一身：地风情万千、活波大胆、勇于开拓：地动用她全部的魅力，争取把事情办成功，在这过程中她几乎总是给那些地碰到的人带来灾难。

—— 拉罗什福科，《回忆录》19

当拉罗什福科写谢弗勒滋夫人时，西奥多·德菜塞还没有写小说，马克思主义改治修辞还未出现，新泽西州北部的景观还未被英国教授开发出来，机场里还没有纪念品商店，也不存在机场。他和罗伯特·马丁·亚当斯各自受某种知识环境影响，但他们生活的社会不同，谈论的事情不同。尽管如此，他们的观察有很多共同的地方 —— 如果我们不考虑他们说的内容只看他们怎么组织语言。

他们每个人都在精心盘算着一个点，从一开始就已经知道这个点，但为了水到渠成地达到它最大的效果，一直在做预备和准备工作。因为对自己谈论的话题有丰富的经验，他们每个人都表现出一副自信十足的姿态。他的判断无可辩驳，那些忍不住质疑的念头通常都会被打消，因为他们不会因言过其实而显得焦虑不安。亚当斯表示他不仅熟悉这种丑质，还熟悉其他种类的丑陋时，消除了读者的疑患。就好像不存在这些事物是否丑陋的疑问：他只关心他对它们的丑陋类别是否归属正确。

从拉罗什福科的话中我们可以看出，他认识很多女性，其中一些人很有魅力，另一些人很有才华或很有抱负，但是没有一个人像谢弗勒兹夫人那样。拉罗什福科和亚当斯都是从一个安全的话题讲起。亚当斯描绘的永恒无望的丑陋没有威胁到他自己；拉罗什福科也不会参与到谢弗勒兹夫人的任何项目当中。他们的安全处境，表明他们没有迫切的利益企图，没有急于让读者相信他们所说的话，这种隐含的主张，也体现在句子本身的结构和语气当中。

亚当斯的句子有一种沉思的语气，当然他并非不加选择地写下任何类型的丑陋。拉罗什福科也不急于否定谢弗勒兹夫人；他的描述中有一种欣赏和公正的语气。虽然事实证明接触这个女人很危险，但是这丝毫不减她的魅力，这些魅力不仅丰富多彩，而且很少在同一个人身上出现。想想看，如果拉罗什福科这样写，效果会有多不同：「尽管谢弗勒兹夫人美丽、聪慧…...」。

这些句子没有表达任何疑问，做出的肯定且不加掩饰的判断可能会引起读者质疑，但他们平静而沉着的判断和对细微差异的表达，打消了读者质疑的念头。这种差异不是随意写的；它们是作者思考、观察和验证的结果 —— 像某种调查研究。但这种努力不会反映在表达上；就连写作本身也要听起来很容易。两位作者都没有暗示，他们要设想某些方式消除读者质疑的冲动，虽然他们已经预想过问题，也想出了应对之策。

虽然都仔细斟酌过每个单词的用法和位置，但写完的句子像是即兴的说话。细细思考才会意识到，要即兴说出这么复杂又完美的句子是多么难（两个句子不论怎么改只会改得更差）。两位作家都不想让人察觉到他们付出的努力。这就是为什么要煞费苦心才能让写作看起来跟说话一样：因为写作意味着努力和刻意，有说服力的写作意味着策路。让写作模仿讲话需要做很多努力，出口成章、恰到好处且听起来事实就是如此，可以发生在对话中一常常是正题之前已经说了很多不妥帖的话，大家忘了而已。

因为所有这些共有的特征，所以这些句子在风格上看起来很相似，尽管它们说的不是同一个主题，甚至用的不是同一种语言。

选段 5-9

一座棚栩如生的休伊·朗英雄雕像立在美国国会大厦墓地上方的高座上。他不拘、庞大、年轻的脸庞面向一座大楼，共三十四层，是他花了一年多一点的时间建成的，大部分是联邦政府授入的资金。那件青铜双排扣央克，紧紧地裹住他隆起的肚皮，有着那个时代着装的尊严，像穿着林肯的双排扣长礼服大衣。黄铜雕像的休伊，看起来跟什维尔和纳什维尔、南本德和托皮卡的滑稽佬一样，他们喜欢出没在二十年代术三十年代初一些非法经营的昂贵酒馆里。他看上去像一个边打高尔夫边说黄段子的男人，渴望每个遇到的人的夸赞。看到他立在那里，让我感到悲伤，感到自己老了。他的脚下有一座大理石做的飞马浮雕，刻有一行字，「分享我们的财富」。那是休伊·朗的一句口号，另外一句是「人人都是国王」。

—— A. J. 李伯龄，《路易斯安那公爵》20

在这最后一章，我想观察和追溯美国非洲主义的演变史：从它简单但令人生畏的目的即建立等级差异开始，到它失去这种差异后自我反思的替代性能，再到它在恐惧和欲望的修辞中欣欣向荣的存在。

—— 托妮·莫里森，《在黑暗中游戏：白人性与文学想象》21

克里斯托弗·莱曼-豪普特（Christopher Lehmann-Haupt）在《纽约时报》中评论托妮·莫里森《在黑暗中游戏》和她的小说《爵士乐》时，引用了这句话说明她的文章风格，并把这篇的风格与他称为莫里森的小说之诗进行了对比。他不认同「她用来表达她的观点的风格」22 这句话。他有一个默认的、传统的假设，几乎是新闻界通行的做法，即风格与思想完全分离。所以莫里森应该以更容易理解的方式呈现她的想法。正是基于这一假设，许多修改文章的做法都是最后抖一抖文章的表面，以为可以把污点和瑕疵抖落干净。

莫里森的句子难以理解，不在于它的表面，而在于它的思想。句子的意象图式结构 —— 沿着一条路径从一个位置移向另一个位置的空间移动 —— 是基本的古典特征。下面这句一看就懂的话就是根据那种意象图式写出来的：

我想观察和追溯基督教的历史，看它是怎么从犹太教的异端，发展成为古罗马帝国的国教，再演变成中世纪欧洲的主流宗教的。

这个意象图式融合了一个基本隐喻：思想、信仰和制度 —— 都不是实物，也不能移动 —— 但可以通过隐喻将它理解为可移动的实物。不同国家是比喻意义上的不同位置；演变过程是从一个位置移向另一个位置的隐喻。人们可以「追溯」某观念、信念或制度的历史 —— 从视觉上的「追踪」其历史时期的「运动」所「沿循」的「路径」。莫里森的句子和这个描述基督教的句子，同样是建立在隐喻和意象图式相结合的基础上的。但是这句描述基督教的话一读就懂，而莫里森的句子令人相当费解。两者的差异体现在对主题的构想上。

无论具体的主题还是抽象的主题，在古典风格中都会被构想为大家能看到的「事物」，各个层面都清晰明了 —— 从结构到细节。任何有能力的观察者看到后，都会承认这种文化「事物」。它的存在独立于作者的构想，当然也独立于作者的文章。二个主题，通过这种方式被构想为「事物」，既契合空间运动的意象图式，也契合将变化比作空间位移的隐喻。

即使读者无法准确描述基督教，甚至也许只能勉强将它与佛教区分开来，但《纽约时报》的大多数读者都会承认 —— 当然也包括克里斯托弗·菜曼-豪普特 —— 人们可以观察基督教，就像可以观察巴吞鲁日国会大厦里的休伊·明的雕像一样。和基督教不一样，「美国非洲主义」因为自身的抽象而吸引注意力，正是因为它没有一个普遍认可的边界 —— 无论一个概念多么不确定都需要这样的边界，有了边界，才能从只有特殊读者理解的特殊观念变为日常谈论的通俗观念，在修辞目的上和可追溯轨迹的行星一样没有区别。

美国非洲主义历史的三个阶段同样很准理解，所有这些都是陌生的抽象概念，在当代美国文化中还未得到普及。「中世纪欧洲」也是一个抽象的概念，但大家基本都知道；即使《纽约时报》的读者对中世纪欧洲完全没有概念，他们也可以认为这种抽象概念是确定且合理的，因为这类读者相信他可以自己查到。「恐惧和欲望的修辞」还没有这种普及程度，所以，美国非洲主义在恐惧和欲望的修辞中欣欣向荣的存在不能理所当然地被接受。

莫里森的描述难以理解并不是因为偶然因素，不是换「另一种语言风格」即更容易理解的语言就能被理解了。她谈论的是一些还没有普及的特殊概念，这些概念无法独立于她的思想而存在。因此，在这段话中，作者和读者之间的不对等关系说明她的风格不是古典风格。假如一位作者是以古典风格呈现这样一个主题，要想追溯它的运动轨迹，就得先分析出美国非洲主义这个事实的具体细节，让读者能当作一件他可以体验的「事物」来理解。要用读者不易察觉的方式把实际的说服场景换成典型场景，而古典风格作者还得说服他的读者相信，他可以用理解金星的方式理解美国非洲主义，像一个天文学家追溯金星轨迹一样追溯美国非洲主义的发展路径。主题的抽象性质并不妨碍作者构建这样一个概念：像夏斯岱尔记录文化历史一样，像弗里德伦德尔鉴赏古画一样，像多德翻译新约一样，像费曼研究数学物理一样，像拉法耶特夫人观察情感一样，像塞维涅夫人观察社会一样，呈现最抽象的领域里最抽象的事物，就好像在谈论雕像、草莓或昏星一样。

第一眼就能看出来，李伯龄描述休伊·朗的雕像的话可能与托妮·莫里森的那段话没有任何共同之处。莫里森谈的是抽象的文化现象和它的发展顺序；李伯龄谈的是任何人站在休伊·朗的坟墓前都能看到的静态雕像。把两段话放在一起，看起来好像验证了众多写作指南的建议：「要表现具体，避免抽象」。当然，无论思维还是写作都无法避免使用抽象事物，所以像大多数毫无针对性的建议一样，「要表现具体，避免抽象」这条准则很难用于实践。不过这条准则与风格上的合理观察至少有那么一点点关系，就像「你无法确定任何事情」这句话与海森堡的不确定性原理的关系。

李伯龄描述的休伊·朗的雕像，依据的是二十世纪二三十年代的美国文化，这种文化概念跟莫里森笔下的文章一样抽象，至少对李伯龄来说是个人想法，就像莫里森说的美国非洲主义运动对她来说也是个人想法。两者在风格上的差异体现在他们阐述抽象概念的方式上。莫里森说的美国非洲主义很难代入进去，因为莫里森没有把她描述的主题当作一种任何人都可以验证的「事物」。因此，她的概念的抽象性质更为突出，她留给读者的选择是，要么认同她说的或她思考的，要么多多少少都会觉得这是一种个人的随意视角。

李伯龄展示了古典风格的一种典型过渡方式，从任何人都可以自己看得到的事物 —— 雕像 —— 到基于抽象文化和道德观念的个人解读。他从没说任何其他人都能看到他这座雕像的文化环境；他把那种环境当作一种理所当然的实物，暗示任何人只要在现场都能描述出最细微的细节。所以仔细分析后才会意识到，虽然任何人都能验证雕像的存在与卷轴上刻的字（分享我们的财富），但如果读者不是把李伯龄的思考当成一种事物，就不会理解他从描述雕像自然过渡到描述卷轴的解读方式。李伯龄知道，要获得认同就得说服读者，但他从未明确承认有说服读者的必要。相反，他解决这个问题用的是一种巧妙的并置和不言自明的保证：他所说的一切（不论是事实还是观点），跟他眼前的事物一样可信 —— 排除偶然的空间因素和时间因素 —— 你也可以在眼前看到。看看「分享我们的财富」与「每个人都是国王」的对比，第一句是刻在卷轴上的口号，而第二句是李伯龄引用的休伊·朗的另一句口号。休伊·朗的墓地上看不到第二句口号，但它是休伊·朗最著名的句子之一。任何人只要查阅相关资料，都能印证李伯龄说的话。把作者的解读当作一种可以通过相关出处验证的事物，只是一个隐形的步骤；不让读者察觉到这段话的相关出处源于作者的想象，是一种古典风格技巧。
