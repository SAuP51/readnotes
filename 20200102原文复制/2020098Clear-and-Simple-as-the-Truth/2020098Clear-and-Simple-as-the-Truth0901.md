## Advanced Writing

Every classic stylist encounters novel situations. We explained in the Essay how some occasions call for a sequence of styles, or a blend of styles, or the development of a special style based on a general style. A style, after all, is defined by a coherent and consistent stand on the elements of style, expressed as a short series of questions about truth, presentation, writer, reader, thought, language, and their relationships. These questions are addressed to fundamental issues that must be answered deliberately or by default before we can write at all. Style is an intellectual matter of thinking through these questions in any situation. Someone who has worked through the curriculum of the Studio is equipped to recognize and work on new projects without further coaching by thinking through the elements of style and drawing on techniques learned in the Studio. In what follows, we suggest a few encounters with novelty.

EXERCISE 13: Sketchbook

Most of the writing instruction in the United States focuses on revision. This approach is fatal for the student attempting to master classic style. The essential ability of the classic stylist is to inhabit the style and to work within it. It is almost always a mistake to try to drag a piece of writing that was unclassic at its inception over rocks and through vegetation in a misconceived attempt to move it somehow to classic heights. Inhabiting the style means imaginatively blending the classic scene with the mental network supporting expression. The blend anchors the network and provides the stylistic structure. It is the platform from which the classic stylist works from beginning to end. The classic stylist learns to speak directly from inside that blend, even if the initial performances are weak. A piece conceived and written from within classic style can be improved, but no draft written without a settled style can be revised into classic style. The conventional advice to think of「style」as a final touch leads to disaster because style is not a surface decoration that can be added during revision. Style must be considered at the outset. Forget entirely the idea that「working on your writing」begins after you have something down on paper.

Consider that students in an art studio are often asked to take their sketchbook out into the field to do speed sketching. They see something and sketch it rapidly, never erasing but instead flipping quickly to a blank page to sketch something else. Later, they review their sketches, but they do not revise. In this Studio, the sketchbook exercise asks you to do in writing what the art student does in speed sketching. Here is the exercise: Recognize something in the field; step into classic style; present your recognition. Do not revise. Continue until you have ten prose sketches. As you begin to advance in your sketchbook exercises, you might move up, as you did in the common exercises, to subjects that are less and less directly perceptible, always blending them stylistically with what is directly perceptible. Once you have finished your ten speed sketches in classic style, put the work of your session aside. Review it later, but do not revise it. Tomorrow, do the sketchbook exercise again. A daily dose of the sketchbook exercise for a couple of weeks seems to have the power to move students rapidly. At first, they find this extremely difficult and seem to make no progress, but after a few days the style starts to come naturally. Some students get past their previous conditioning only after a couple of weeks of the sketchbook exercise has purged them of bad habits.

EXERCISE 14: Coherent Mixed Styles

It may seem paradoxical in a Studio devoted to classic style to include the study of styles that are only partially classic. But classic virtues can come from even a few classic ingredients, and the opportunity to deploy such mixed styles arises frequently. Instruction manuals have a practical motive, but they do not have to be impersonal; the cast can be collusive; the thought and language can be distinctive. The voice does not have to be one job description speaking to another. We can instead match a practical motive with a classic presentation, to produce a mixed style that might be called classic practical style, a style whose attraction and power do not depend exclusively on accomplishing a practical goal. Imagine reading a cookbook even if you have no intention of cooking. A cookbook in classic practical style might be attractive purely for the virtues of its classic presentation. There are many styles that can be mixed with classic ingredients to create an unmistakably classic flavor.

Here is the exercise: Pick a subject you understand well and write a「how-to」piece. The subject can be anything: how to identify a tree from its leaves, how to avoid probate, how to give a dinner party. The piece will be practical, of course, but experiment with the inclusion of classic ingredients. These classic ingredients might include a classic voice, a collusive cast, a full command of language, a crisp onset and dismount, truth as a complementary motive, presentation as a complementary purpose.

EXERCISE 15: Lists

Can a list be written in classic style? Of course. The material does not determine the style. The writer of a list could accept the stand of slavish adherence to a template, like a notary providing an inventory. But the writer can take the classic stand — someone recognizes something worth presenting to someone else. The writer can assume full responsibility for the selection.

A menu is a list, but if it is written in classic style, it can present the character and tradition of a restaurant and the nature of a cuisine. There is an owner, chef, or dining room manager standing behind the presentation. In classic style, neither the menu nor the wine list is a helter-skelter list of what happens to be available to eat and drink. A wine list can present the knowledge, culture, and taste of the sommelier. In the previous exercise, you practiced writing something in classic style that had an additional practical purpose. Menus and wine lists can similarly be written in classic style even though their ostensible purpose is practical. For someone interested in food and wine, a classic menu or wine list can be read for pleasure, even if the restaurant is a continent away or has been closed for years.

Menus and wine lists are only one example of lists that can take the classic stand and can accordingly be read and enjoyed independent of any practical goal. Georges Perec, in La vie mode d'emploi (Life A User's Manual), presents lists of the contents of basement storage lockers of an imaginary apartment building. Each is a masterful presentation in an individual voice not just of the items but also of the owner's habits, history, and character, and their cultural resonance. Here are two:

Bartlebooth's cellar:

In Bartlebooth's cellar there is some left-over coal on top of which still lies a black enamelled metal scuttle with a wooden grip fitted on its wire handle, a bicycle hanging on a butcher's hook, now unoccupied bottle racks, and his four travelling chests, four curved chests covered in tarred canvas, braced with wooden slats, with brass corners and hasps, and lined throughout with a sheet of zinc to ensure waterproofing.

The Rorschachs' cellar:

A bottle rack, wire, plastic-coated, is placed to the left of the slatted door. The lower level of the rack holds five bottles of fruit brandies: kirsch, apricot, quetsch, plum, raspberry. On one of the middle rows there is the score — in Russian — of Rimsky-Korsakov's version of Pushkin's Golden Cockerel, and a probably popular novel entitled Spice, or the Revenge of the Louvain Locksmith, with a cover depicting a girl handing a bag of gold to a judge. On the top row, a lidless octagonal tin containing a few novelty chessmen made of plastic, crudely imitating Chinese ivory pieces: the knight is a kind of Dragon, the king a seated Buddha.

Ernest Hemingway is said to have written a six-word short story — 「For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.」 — that provides the inspiration for this exercise. Here is the exercise: Locate some suitable publication that carries classified advertisements, and write for that publication a list offering items for sale. Take the classic stand.

EXERCISE 16: Résumé

A résumé is a list presenting a person. Its writer can take the classic stand. Often, résumés are completely unclassic, signaling — through their formatting and phrasing — anxiety and desire. Résumés often appear simultaneously pushy and defensive, with ungenerous margins, scarce white space, compressed fonts, hyperbolic and aggressive vocabulary (「High-powered self-starter seeks management position with superpotential for advancement」), and the listing of every conceivable fact that might sway a reader (「Second-place, all-class essay competition, 7th grade, East Nowhere Middle School」). Academic résumés often expose self-inflicted wounds under「Publications」(「Genetics of the ALDH2 locus. Science, submitted」). Anyone established in the academy knows that anybody can submit anything anywhere; a submission is not a publication. A classic résumé, by contrast, is one whose writer, stylistically, is self-possessed, unconcerned, merely presenting. Stylistically, the writer has no anxiety. The writer does not want anything from the reader. The motive is truth — not desire for a job — and there is symmetry between writer and reader. A classic résumé typically has pleasing margins, ample white space, and a classic font. Its phrasing is calm. It is often distinctive for the range of lower-level detritus it leaves out. The style is not affected at all by insecurity, fear of unemployment, or sense of urgency, regardless of what is in the writer's mental network.

Here is the exercise: Write a résumé strongly influenced by classic style for a historical person: Anne Boleyn before her marriage, Einstein when he worked in the Swiss patent office, Hannibal before he invaded Europe, Grace Kelly before she made her first movie, Vermeer applying to the painters' guild.

EXERCISE 17: Admissions Essay

The essay, or statement, that an applicant submits for admission to a program belongs to a real scene that, like the résumé and the job interview, is unclassic in cast and purpose. But the applicant can write the essay entirely in classic style and may by doing so distinguish the application from a mountain of predictable rival submissions. Here is the exercise: Imagine such a case and write an admissions essay in which you, someone you know, or a historical or fictional person is the candidate.

EXERCISE 18: Science

Classic style is often the ideal style for scientific writing. Here is the exercise: Write a scientific piece in classic style. Point out where your reader should look and present the recognition. Stylistically, your reader is with you in a scene of classic joint attention, and pleased to be there.

Accomplished scientists often eschew stridency of any sort, since after all it is presumably the science that is the subject rather than the scientist or the scientist's chapel. Treating scientific writing as adversarial argument disguises the fact that almost all of a mature scientific piece is presentational: it presents the relevant tradition of research, and it presents the facts, events, and evidence that the reader needs.

Your own writing for this exercise will not resemble Sir Isaac Newton's prose, because he wrote in the early eighteenth century, but it may come as a surprise to see how often Newton used a style close to classic. Here is a passage from the Opticks (1704):

In a very dark Chamber, at a round Hole, about one third Part of an Inch broad made in the Shut of a Window, I placed a Glass Prism, whereby the Beam of the Sun's Light, which came in at that Hole, might be refracted upwards toward the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and there form a colour'd Image of the Sun. The Axis of the Prism (that is the Line passing through the middle of the Prism from one end of it to the other end parallel to the edge of the Refracting Angle was in this and the following Experiments perpendicular to the incident Rys. About this Axis I turned the Prism slowly, and saw the refracted Light on the Wall, or coloured Image of the Sun, first to descend, and then to ascend. Between the Descent and Ascent, when the Image seemed Stationary, I stopp'd the Prism, and fix'd it in that Posture, that it should be moved no more. For in that posture the Refractions of the Light at the two Sides of the Refracting Angle, that is at the Entrance of the Rays into the Prism, and at their going out of it, were equal to one another.

EXERCISE 19: Obituaries

obituaries often follow a template closely and exclude classic presentation. Such obituaries are conventional descriptions of mainly surface information — date and place of birth, education, professional accomplishment, cause of death. In these routine performances, there is often no indication that the writer is responsible for selecting details or exercising independent judgment. There are, however, exceptions. Jeremy Pearce's obituary for John L. Bull, one of the authors of The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region, from which we quote in the first entry of the Museum, appeared in The New York Times for 15 August 2006. He includes the obligatory descriptive information but takes the classic stance in presenting what he has judged to be worth presenting. Here is how he ends the obituary:

Mr. Bull was often accompanied by his wife, an educator at the [American Museum of Natural History], on birding journeys. In 1989, the couple collaborated on a book,「Birds of North America: Western Region: A Quick Identification Guide for All Bird-Watchers.」

Remarking on the mourning doves that he spotted in Central Park, Mr. Bull observed:「They are the most monogamous birds I've ever watched. They always travel in pairs.」

This is classic presentation; it follows no template. The writer, in offering an analogy between the travels of Mr. Bull and his wife, and the travels of the mourning doves that Mr. Bull observed, decides what is significant and appropriate. His perfect dismount is a classic achievement, one that belongs to a writer, not to a template. Now try writing a classic obituary of your own.

EXERCISE 20: Real Estate Pitch

Like obituaries, real estate prose of the sort one finds in multiple listings of properties for sale is typically entirely impersonal. It is marked by obligatory hyperbole and artificial effervescence. Here is the exercise: Study some real estate prose and then present a house as if it were for sale, offering in classic style what the reader would want to know if that reader were shopping for a house. You might want to present a property not actually for sale: the Ca' d'Oro in Venice, Jacques Cœur's hôtel particulier in Bourges, the Rockoxhuis in Antwerp, the Getty Villa in Malibu, the White House during the federal government's bankruptcy sale.

EXERCISE 21: Restaurant Review

In classic style, direct perceptions, inferences, and judgments can all be treated as recognitions and can all be presented to a companion who will share these recognitions once they are pointed out. Restaurant reviews are not merely replete with inferences and judgments; they are an outstanding example in contemporary writing of discussions of taste, subject to endless debate and qualification. In classic style, taste can be treated as if it were as perceptible as a table setting. A restaurant review in the hands of a classic stylist treats its standards of judgment as obviously appropriate and writes as if the reader would agree not merely with the evaluation of the flavors in the ris de veau en salade but with the standards that produce that evaluation. The style is indifferent to what those standards might be. They might devalue mere novelty or they might value novelty above all. A classic restaurant review could either criticize a formal restaurant for using exotic instead of common ingredients in a traditional dish or praise it for innovating the traditional dish by using exotic ingredients. The classic restaurant review consists, in large measure, of placing the reader in a position to perceive both the validity of the judgments and the appropriateness of the standards — as if such matters are impossible to miss once obstacles are cleared out of the way and the reader has an unobstructed view of things.

Consider:

On a November evening in Dijon, Jean-Pierre Billoux serves wild duck, in its own juice, roasted with apples. This is the refinement of a classic by a master cook. There is no stridency or forced originality. The eight-year-old Corton Grancey seems to have been made for this perfectly roasted duck. This dish is the culmination of a tradition that has its historical roots in Guilaume Tirel's「Chapitre de Fricassure」; it reflects the accumulated wisdom of a six-hundred-year-old craft that translates nature and seasons, and their immemorial recurrence, into textures, fragrances, and flavors that allow you to feel yourself a part of them. It is rooted in a place too; it is not a cuisine suitable for「international hotels.」The seasons, the fragrances, the flavors of Burgundy are not the seasons, the fragrances, the flavors of Kyoto, or London, or Las Vegas.

The superiority of a cuisine rooted in a place and in a season over a cuisine suitable for「international hotels」is not asserted but treated as if it were as obvious as the duck and its apples.

Here is the exercise: Write a classic review of a restaurant and post it to one of the many online sites carrying restaurant reviews. Focus especially on including judgments in passing, almost incidentally, as if they are not personal judgments at all but rather elements of the restaurant that any competent diner could recognize, once pointed in the right direction.

EXERCISE 22: Travel Writing

Travel pieces — like cookbooks, restaurant reviews, and real estate descriptions — can be utilitarian. The reader is going somewhere and looks for facts and information in order to organize a trip. But in all of these genres, the practical purpose can be subordinated or even ignored. Travel writing can be completely presentational, and when it is, it can incorporate indefinite ranges of history, judgments, and cultural commentary, treated as if they can be seen.

The Michelin Green Guides are the gold standard of commercial travel writing. Here is a passage from the entry on the Abbey of Fontenay from the Michelin Green Guide to Burgundy:

Cistercian architecture first appeared in Burgundy in the first half of the 12C (Cistercium was the Latin name for the town of Cîteaux). It is characterized by a spirit of simplicity in keeping with the teaching of St Bernard. He objected bitterly to the luxury displayed in some monastery churches, opposing the theories of some of the great builders of the 11C and 12C with extraordinary passion. His argument against the belief of abbots such as St Hugh, Peter the Venerable, and Suger, who believed that nothing could be too rich for the glory of God was expressed for example in the letter he wrote to William, Abbot of St-Thierry, in which he asks,「Why this excessive height in the churches, this enormous length, this unnecessary width, these sumptuous ornaments and curious paintings that draw the eyes and distract attention and meditation? . . . We the monks, who have forsaken ordinary life and renounce worldly wealth and ostentation for the love of Christ, . . . in whom do we hope to awaken devotion with these ornaments?」

Fontenay, which is now a historic site and has not been a functioning church since the French Revolution of 1789, is one of the finest surviving examples of the austere beauty characteristic of Cistercian architecture, but no current visitor to Fontenay encounters Saint Bernard, his mentality, the opposition between styles of spirituality, or the architectural expression of that opposition in the uncluttered severity of Fontenay contrasted to the rich iconography of its Burgundian rival to the south, Cluny.

On reflection, it is not a surprise that the recognitions presented by the classic travel writer might lie beyond perception. As Mark Twain, launched on his career by his travel writing, observed,「[L]ife does not consist mainly — or even largely — of facts and happenings. It consists mainly of the storm of thoughts that is forever blowing through one's head.」Classic style domesticates these vast conceptual networks by blending them with the classic scene. Travel writing is an exemplary genre for such capacious classic presentation.

Here is the exercise: Write a classic travel piece, a presentation of a place or places, ranging wherever thought takes you, and without foregrounding any practical purpose.

EXERCISE 23: Prejudices: What about Peanut Butter?

A prejudice is something that has been accepted without the benefit of considered judgment: a preference for Swiss chocolate or Chinese tea, let us say, when they have not actually been compared to any alternative: Belgian chocolate or Indian tea. Everyone has such prejudices, but they are rarely presented as such. If you loathe baroque architecture and find art nouveau architecture pleasing because you have paid close attention to the style you like and haven't paid any attention to any other style, your taste has been affected by prejudice, but that is not necessarily a bad thing — especially in classic style, because the style has a fundamental prejudice of its own for human scale, and life is too short to give an impartial and considered judgment to every variety of chocolate or every style of architecture.

Someone with a narrow taste guided by prejudice can in fact offer a thoroughly excellent presentation of what falls within this restricted taste. Someone whose taste for art nouveau architecture has become a prejudice might be just the person whose essay on Victor Horta you will find most informative and even well-judged. Paul Erdös, the subject of a biography called The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, referred to anyone who had stopped doing mathematics as「dead.」For him, nonmathematicians were not alive. This legendary and, for Erdös, personally debilitating prejudice against anything but numbers did not mean that he was not worth listening to when he was talking about mathematics.

A presentation that covers many alternatives is not necessarily as good as a presentation — even if driven by prejudice — that focuses on just one. Here is the exercise: Present something you know and love without being defensive about it at all, without worrying about being fair or balanced. Belgian beer, baroque music, surfing in Southern california. Ignore that voice that says,「What about German beer? Gregorian chant? Alaia surfing in Australia? What about peanut butter?」

EXERCISE 24: Tethered Excursions

For this advanced exercise, select and present in classic style a subject as far away from the blackbird in the tree as possible, something that requires thought branching over almost every kind of conceptual geography. Our example — just one — is the concept of privacy. Privacy is something that cannot be directly perceived at all. It is a concept that stretches over all of human history, with remarkable differences across cultures in the placement of the dividing line between the private and the public. It is a highly nuanced concept that has never settled down. On the contrary, every aspect of it, from legal to moral to psychological, seems to be contested in our own time and place. It involves indefinitely many people, including unknown people. Presenting the concept of privacy is maximally uncongenial to the scene of classic joint attention. If you can blend the conceptual network for thinking and talking about privacy with the classic scene, we think you can blend anything with the classic scene, and you can consider yourself a competent classic stylist.

Conclusion

Every great artist was once an apprentice who learned fundamentals from someone much less talented. Velásquez was a much greater painter than his teacher. Newton was a much greater mathematician than his teacher. Neither could have progressed without a formation in fundamentals. Now that you have obtained a formation in fundamentals and experimented with a few advanced exercises, you have completed the apprenticeship offered in this Studio. But artists never really leave their studios. They continue to refine their grasp of fundamentals and extend their reach. There is no end to this refinement or extension. If there were a final exercise in the Studio, it would be to keep your eyes open for new opportunities to advance your command of style while keeping your presentations clear and simple as the truth.

0901 写作进阶练习

每位古典风格作者都会遇到新的情境。我们在原理篇解释了有些场合何种情况需要用到一组风格，或者混合风格，或者一种由一般风格发展而来的特殊风格。毕竟，风格的确立取决于对风格元素采取的一种连贯一致的立场，这种立场通过一系列问题表现出来，即真相、呈现、作者、读者、思想、语言，以及它们两两之间的关系。这些问题是我们开始写作之前，必须刻意回答或默认回答的基础问题。决定风格的是思想，遇到任一情境都要充分思考这些问题。学完工作室全部课程的人，即使后续没有进一步的指导，也可以通过思考这些风格元素并运用工作室学到的技巧，识别和处理新的主题类型。下面我们列举一些可能会遇到的新情境。

练习 13：速写

美国大部分写作教学强调文章的修改。这种方法对想要学习古典风格的学生来说是致命的。古典风格作家的基本能力，是让自己沉浸到这种风格中，在这种风格中写作。拖着一篇一开始就不是古典风格的文章穿越乱石丛林，妄想通过某种方式把它改成古典风格，几乎总是面临失败。沉浸到古典风格中，就是想象着把古典场景和支持表达的思想网络融合在一起。这种融合可以锚定思想网络，提供古典风格的结构。这也是古典风格作者从始至终的工作平台。古典风格作者学习直接以融合场景中的视角说话，即使一开始的表现一般。一篇在古典风格框架内构思和创作的文章有修改的余地，但没有确立特定风格的草稿不可能改成古典风格。传统建议都是把「风格」看作最后的润色，这种见解简直是灾难，因为风格不是改改就能加上去的表层修饰。风格必须从一开始就考虑。别再以为「开始写作」是在你写下什么之后才开始的。来艺术工作室经常要求学生带着速写本去野外速写。他们看到一些东西，迅速画出来，从不擦改，而是很快翻到下一张空白页继续画其他东西。之后，他们会回看自己的速写，但他们不会修改。本工作室的速写练习要求你像艺术生速写一样写作。

练习题：观察野外的场景；进入古典风格；呈现你的观察。不要修改。坚持做完十篇文章速写。当你开始做速写进阶练习时，你可能要增加难度，像你做通用练习一样，去挑战那些没那么容易直接观察到的事物，在风格上要始终将它们融入可直接观察的事物中。完成十个古典风格速写练习后，把这阶段的练习放到一边。过段时间再回看，但不要修改它们。明天，再做一遍速写练习。每天做一点速写练习并连续坚持几周，看起来能快速提升学生的风格水平。一开始，他们觉得很难，进步也不明显，但几天后，就开始自然而然地写出古典风格了。通过几周的速写练习改掉坏习惯后，一些学生很快克服了前期的适应阶段。

练习 14：风格融合

一个主张古典风格的工作室，提倡学习不完全是古典风格的风格，看起来自相矛盾。但只要有少部分古典风格成分，也能体现古典风格的特点，而且应用这种混合风格的机会很多。指导手册的动机是实用。但也没必要表现得很冷淡：角色之间可以多些互动；思想和语言可以更鲜明。它的口吻不一定是用一项工作描述回应另一项工作描述。我们可以换一种方式，把实用动机与古典呈现结合起来，创造一种混合风格，也许可以称为古典实用风格，这种混合风格的魅力和力量并不局限于实现一个实际的目标。想象你在读一本烹饪菜谱，尽管你没有烹饪的意愿。古典实用风格的烹饪菜谱，可能仅仅因为古典呈现的特点很吸引人。许多风格都可以融入古典风格的成分，创造出一种毫不违和的古典风味。

练习题：挑一个你理解得比较透彻的主题，写一篇「如何做」的教程，主题不限。如何通过树叶认出一棵树，如何避免遗嘱认证，如何举办一场晚会。当然了，文章的目的是实用，但尝试把古典风格的成分融入其中。这些古典风格的成分可能包含古典风格的口吻、相互配合的角色、充分表达的语言、利落的开头和收尾、作为互补动机的真相、作为互补目的的呈现。

练习 15：清单

清单可以用古典风格写吗？当然！写作素材并不决定风格类型。写清单的人完全可以按照模板要求写，像公证人出具物品清单一样。但作者还可以采取古典风格的立场一某人发现值得向他人呈现的东西。作者会为他的选择承担所有责任。

一份菜单就是一份清单，但如果用古典风格来写，也能呈现一家餐馆的特色和传统，以及某种菜系的性质。呈现的背后有餐馆老板、厨师和餐厅经理。古典风格中，一份菜单或酒单，绝不是毫无章法地列出刚好能供应的食物和酒水清单。一份酒单可以透露待酒师的知识、文化和品位。在上一个练习中，你练习了如何把具有其他实用目的事物写成古典风格。同样，菜单和酒单也能用古典风格写出来，尽管它们的实用目的很明显。对食物和酒感兴趣的人，阅读一份古典风格的菜单或酒单，也能读得津津有味，哪怕这家餐馆远在大陆的另一边，或者关门好多年了。

菜单和酒单，作为清单的其中一种形式，可以用古典立场呈现，自然也能阅读和欣赏，无论它的实用目的是什么。乔治·佩雷克（Georges Perec）在《人生拼图版》（La vie mode d'emploi）这本书中想象出一座公寓大楼，呈现了其地下室储物柜的物品清单。每一份清单都是一份精彩绝伦的呈现，用个体口吻讲述的不只是物品本身，还有屋主的习惯、历史和性格以及不同屋主的文化共鸣。试举其中两例。

巴特尔布思的地窖：

巴特尔布思的地下室里放着用剩的煤，煤上还放了一只装着木柄铁丝把手的黑色搪瓷桶，一辆自行车挂在肉钩上，放瓶子的空柳条篮和四只大旅行箱鼓鼓的，油布面，木条腰带，四角包铜饰，箱内全部用薄锌片衬里，因此箱子严密不渗水。1

罗尔沙斯的酒窖：

栅栏门左侧放着一个搁瓶子的包塑铁丝笼，下层放着五瓶果酒：樱桃酒、黄香李酒、紫罗兰李酒、李子酒、覆盆子酒。中间条板上放着里姆斯基科萨柯夫根据普希金作品改编的《金公鸡》—— 俄语写的 —— 和一本通俗小说《鲁汶铁匠的讼费或复仇》，封面印着一位年轻姑娘把一袋金子送给一位法官。上面条板上放着一个没有盖的八边形盒子，里面放着几个模仿中国牙雕的塑料棋子：马是一种龙，国王是一个坐着的菩萨。① 2

①《人生拼图版》两个选段的汉译文均出自丁雪英和连燕堂的合译版本。—— 译者注

据说欧内斯特·海明威写过一篇只有六个词的短篇小说 ——「出售。婴鞋。未穿。」（For sale..Baby shoes..Never worn。）—— 这给了本练习灵感。

练习题：找一份合适的出版物，刊登分类广告的那种，并为该出版物编写一份待售物品清单。用上古典立场。

练习 16：简历

简历是一种呈现个人的清单。写简历的人也可以采取古典立场。一般，简历完全不属于古典风格，它的格式和措辞处处透露着焦虑和渴望。简历看起来既咄咄逼人又急于自我辩护，页边距很窄，没有多少空白，字密密麻麻，措辞夸张且一副志在必得的口气（自我驱动力强，寻求潜在晋升空间大的管理岗），为了说服读者，逐一列出所有能想到的全部事实（东方止境中学七年级全班作文比赛第二名）。学术型简历通常在「发表作品」栏下自揭伤疤（《科学》「ALDH2 中心的基因」，已提交）。在学术界立足的人都知道任何人可以在任何地方提交作品；但提交不代表发表。相比而言，用古典风格写简历的人，在风格上笃定从容，只是呈现。从风格上看，作者没有一丝焦虑。作者对读者别无所求。动机就是真相一而不是想要一份工作一作者与读者之间是对等关系。一份古典风格作品，常常选用古典字体，并留出合适的页边距和充分的空白。它的措辞沉着冷静。因为没有低级的废话，格外与众不同。古典风格不会因为缺乏安全、恐惧失业或感到紧迫受任何影响，不管作者的思想网络发生了什么。

练习题：为一位历史人物写份古典风格的简历：结婚前的安妮·博林（Anne Boleyn），曾在瑞士专利注册局工作的爱因斯坦（Einstein），

入侵欧洲之前的汉尼拔（Hannibal），拍出电影处女作前的格蕾丝·凯利（Grace Kelly），申请加入画家协会的维米尔（Vermeer）。

练习 17：申请书

申请加入某个项目时呈递的论文或陈述，是一种现实场景，与简历和面试一样，角色和目的都不是古典风格。但申请人完全可以采用古典风格撰写论文，还有可能借此从众多墨守成规的申请书中脱颖而出。

练习题：想象这样一种场合，为候选人写一封申请书，候选人可以是你自己、你知道的人，也可以是一位历史人物或一位小说角色。

练习 18：科学写作

古典风格常常是科学写作的理想风格。

练习题：用古典风格写一篇科学论文。向读者指出应该关注的地方，并呈现你的观察结果。在风格上，你的读者与你处在同一个古典联合注意场景中，也很乐意待在那种场景中。

优秀的科学家通常避免任何形式的咄咄逼人，毕竟文章主题大部分时候应是科学本身，而不是科学家或科学教条。把科学写作当作针锋相对的辩驳忽视了一个事实：一篇成熟的科学论文处处都在呈现相关的研究传统，呈现读者想了解的事实、事件和证据。

你本次练习的文章不会像艾萨克·牛顿爵士的文章一样，因为他写于十八世纪早期，但是你也许会惊讶地发现，牛顿经常使用的写作风格，跟古典风格非常接近。下面一段话摘自牛顿的著作《光学》（Opticks）（1704）。

在一间非常黑暗的房间里，护窗板上开了一个三分之一英寸的圆孔，我在圆孔处放了一块玻璃棱镜，太阳光束透过这个圆孔，可能会向上折射到室内对面墙壁上，并在那里形成太阳的彩色图像。本实验以及接下来的实验中，棱镜的轴（通过棱镜中心从一端到另一端且与折射角的边平行的直线）与入射光线垂直。我围绕此轴慢慢转动棱镜，看到墙上的折射光，即太阳的彩色图像，先下降，然后上升。在下降和上升之间，当图像看起来不动时，我停止转动棱镜，并将它固定在这一姿势中，以使它不再转动。因为在这种姿势时，光的折射在折射角两侧，即在光射入和射出棱镜处，彼此相等。① 3

练习 19：讣告

讣告通常严格按照模板来写，不会用古典风格呈现。这些讣告主要是对表面信息的常规描述一出生的地方和日期、教育程度、职业成就、死亡原因。一般看不出来这些常规描述是作者个人的选择或独立判断。但是，也有例外。我们在博览篇第一条引用过一本书《奥杜邦协会北美鸟类野外观鸟指南·美国东部地区》，其中一位作者是约翰·布尔，他逝世后，杰拉米·佩尔斯为他写了一则讣告，刊载于 2006 年 8 月 15 日出版的《纽约时报》上。这篇讣告除了给出必要信息，还以古典立场呈现了作者认为值得呈现的内容，讣告结尾如下。下常非风典言

布尔先生的妻子，一位美国自然历史博物馆的教育工作者，



经常陪同布尔观鸟。1989 年，这对夫妇合著了一本书《现鸟追查手册：北美西部地区鸟类图鉴》（Birds 时 Norh America: Western

Region: A Quick Identification Guide for All Bird-Watchers)

布尔先生在中央公园看到一对哀鸣的鸽子，评论道：「我

见过的鸟当中，它们最遵守一夫一妻原则。它们总是成双成对地

飞行。」

这就是古典呈现，不用任何模板。作者把布尔先生与他妻子的旅行，类比为布尔先生看到的一对哀鸣的鸽子的飞行时，决定了什么信息是重要的、合适的。他用古典风格写出了完美的结尾，这是一位作者的结尾，而不是一份模板的结尾。现在试着为自己写一则古典风格的讣告。

练习 20：房产广告

同讣告一样，人们在很多房屋出售资讯中看到的那种房地产介绍通常枯燥乏味。用词夸张和佯装热情是一贯的做派。

练习题：先研读一些真实的房地产介绍信息，然后写一则房产介绍，就好像要放到市场上出售一样，用古典风格写，给真正有买房意愿的读者提供他想要的信息。或许你也可以给不供出售的房产写广告：威斯（Ca'd'oro），法· ((Jacques Ceur's

Hotel particuier 人比利时安特卫普洛克斯庭院（the Rockoxhuis 入加州马里布的盖蒂别墅（the Getty Villa 入联邦政府破产期间出售的美国白官。

练习 21：餐厅评论

在古典风格中，直接观察、推测和判断都可以看作可识别的事物并呈现给身边的人，一旦指出来，他们会像你一样看到这些事物。餐厅评论不完全是推测与判断；它们是典型的现代食评文章，容易引发没完没了的争议和解释。在古典风格中，食物味道可以跟桌上的餐具一样具体可见。古典风格作者写餐厅评论就好像他的评判标准自然公正，读者不仅会认可作者对沙拉酱甜面包口味的评判，还会认可他的评判标准。古典风格并不看重这些评判标准可能是什么。这些标准可以把创新看得一文不值，也可以认为创新高于一切。一篇古典风格的餐厅评论，既可以批判一家正统餐厅使用新奇原料而非常规原料做一道传统菜肴，也可以赞赏它使用新奇原料创新传统菜肴。古典风格的餐厅评论很大程度上将读者置于一种位置，让他既能看出评判是否合理也能看出评判标准是否恰当一好像一旦清除障碍，读者的视线畅通，就不可能漏掉这些问题。我们来看下面这一段文字。

在法国第戎十一月的某个晚上，让 - 皮埃尔·比尤（Jean- Pierre Billoux）烹饪了一道烤野鸭子，就着鸭子自带的酱汁，跟苹果一起烤。这是一位烹饪大师对一道经典莱式所做的改良。没有程硬的态度，也不是非创新不可。八年的戈东格朗赛葡萄酒，似乎专为这道完美的烤鸭酿造。这道菜标志着传统莱系的巅峰，可 · (Guilaume Tirel）的「炖肉主题」（Chapitre de Fricassure）；这反映了六百年工艺传承下来的智慧，将自然与季节以及它们古老的周而复始化成肌理、芬芳和口味，让你觉得自己是它们的一部分。它也有自已的专属领地：它不会出现在「国际酒店」里。勃艮第的季节、芬芳和风味，不是京都、伦敦或拉斯维加斯的季节、芬芳和风味。

一道独属某个地方某个季节的菜肴，远胜「国际酒店」专供的菜

肴，这种优势没有被反复强调，而是被看作和鸭子以及它搭配的苹果一

样显然。

练习题：写一篇古典风格的餐厅评论，并发布到任何一个可以线上点评餐厅的网站上。重点在于你的评价不要太刻意，几乎是顺口一提，好像它们根本不是个人的评论，而是餐厅本身的元素一任何一位有能力的食客都能看到，只要指出正确的方向。

练习 22：旅游纪行

跟食谱、餐厅评论和房地产资讯一样，旅游纪行可以很实用。读者计划去某个地方，为组织旅行寻找事实和信息。但是所有这些题材的实用目的可以是顺带的，或者甚至可以忽略。旅游纪行完全可以写成呈现，一旦用这种方式，它可以将各种历史、判断和文化评论都包含进去，把它们都当作直接可见的事物。容售中回

《米其林绿色指南》（The Michelin Green Guides）是商业旅行指南的黄金标准。下面这段文字是《米其林绿色指南·勃艮第版》对枫特奈修道院（Abbey of Fontenay）的介绍。

十二世纪上半叶勃艮第首次出现熙笃会【Cistercium 是 Citeaux（熙笃）的拉丁文】。它以简洁的风格著称，遵从圣·伯纳尔德（St. Bernard）的教律。他极力反对一些修道院教堂的奢华装饰，不认同十一、十二世纪那些热情洋溢的伟大建筑师的理论。圣·休 (St. Hugh）、（Peter the Venerable）以（Suger）等修道院院长认为，为了上帝的荣誉再怎么富丽堂皇都不为过，圣·伯纳尔德对此有截然相反的意见，他在写给圣·蒂埃里（St. Thierry）修道院院长威廉的信中问道：「为什么教堂要建得这么高、这么长、这么宽，远远超过正常的需要？为什么用这些奢华的装饰物和激发好奇心的画作吸人眼球、分散注意力和扰乱清修？… 我们这些僧侣，因为热爱耶稣基督，放弃了凡俗的生活，放弃了世俗的财富和荣誉，… 我们希望用这些装饰唤起谁的热忱呢？」4

枫特奈修道院，自 1789 年法国大革命结束后不再发挥教堂的功能，现在作为一道历史遗迹，完好保存着熙笃会建筑典型的简洁朴素特征。只是，如今参观枫特奈的游客再也不会遇到圣·伯纳尔德，再也无法体会他的心态，再也不会看到两种相互对立的精神风格和这种对立表达在建筑上的特点一一枫特奈修道院简洁朴素，而另一座同在勃艮第靠南边

的克卢尼修道院（Cuny）装饰繁华。

仔细想想，古典纪行作家呈现的见闻不一定是直接观察到的事物，也没什么奇怪的。以纪行开启作家生涯的马克·吐温说：「生活的主要构成部分一或者说大部分构成部分 — 不是事实或事件，而是入们头脑中时刻发生的思想风暴。」5 古典风格将这巨大的思想网络与古典场景融

合在一起。纪行是练习这种大容量古典呈现的最佳题材。

练习题：用古典风格写一篇纪行，介绍一个或多个地方，跟着你的

思路走，不用特别强调任何实用目的。

练习 23：偏见：花生酱是不是更好？

偏见是未经过深思熟虑就确认的观点。举个例子，当一个人只品尝过瑞士巧克力或中国茶，不知道实际上还有别的同类产品（比如此利时巧克力或者印度茶）可以比较时，他就会偏好瑞士巧克力或中国茶。每个人都有这类偏见，但很少以这种方式表现出来。如果你喜欢新艺术运动风格的建筑却不喜欢巴洛克风格的建筑，只是因为你关注你喜欢的风格没关注任何别的风格，那么你的品位就带着偏见，但这不一定是件坏

事一尤其在古典风格中，古典风格因人类的局限性有它自身的基本偏见，而人生苦短，不可能客观、全面地考虑到巧克力的每个品种或建筑的每种风格。

一个带着偏见、品位狭隘的人，实际上可以把原本局限的品位呈现得十分精彩。你可能会发现，一个对艺术运动风格有自己偏见的人，对维克多·霍塔（Victor Horta) ①的介绍可能恰恰最实用甚至最中肯。人物传记《数字情种》（The Man Who Loved Only Numbers）中的主角保罗·埃尔德什② (Paul Erde6s），认为一旦停止数学活动，人就「死了」。对他而言，不从事数学的人没有活着的。埃尔德什贬低数字之外的一切事物，这种人所共知的偏见，并不意味着当埃尔德什谈论数学时，他的观点就不值得听。

追求面面俱到的呈现，不一定胜过专注某一个方面的呈现，即使是

出于偏见。

练习题：介绍一种你熟悉并且钟情的事物，不用为它辩护，也不用

担心你的介绍是否有失公允或有所偏颇。比如比利时啤酒、巴洛克音

①维克多·霍塔（Victor Horta),1861 一 1947，比利时人，世界著名建筑设计大

师，新艺术运动的杰出代表人物之一。一译者注

②保罗·埃尔德什（Paul Erde6s），匈牙利籍犹太人，数学家，论文数量居史上

数学家之最。一译者注

乐、南加州冲浪。忽略这些声音：「德国啤酒怎么样？格里高利圣咏呢？

澳大利亚阿拉亚冲浪呢？花生酱怎么样？」

练习 24：镣铐之游：谈隐私

为这次进阶练习选一个与「树上的乌鸦鹩」截然不同的主题，用古典风格呈现时需要考虑到几乎每一种概念地理环境（Conceptual geography）。我们仅举隐私概念这一个例子。隐私是一种无法直接观察到的东西。它是一个延及整个人类历史的概念，不同文化对隐私与公开之间的界限有截然不同的区分。它是一种相当微妙的概念，从未有确定的定义。相反，从法理到道德再到心理学，它的每一个方面似乎都受到我们自己时代和社会的质疑。它涉及很多人，这当中的人数无法确定，还包括未知的人。呈现隐私概念，与古典联合注意的场景格格不入。如果你能将思考隐私和谈论隐私的概念网络与古典场景结合起来，我们认为你有能力将任何东西与古典场景结合起来，你也就可以把自己看作一位合格的古典风格作者了。
