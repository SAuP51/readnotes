More Advance Praise for Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis

The 3rd edition of this wonderful book brings some additional tools which are relevant and invaluable to any analyst in any field. The structure and framework ensure ease of use and are very practical—particularly the grouping of the techniques into "families." The applicability of the techniques is easily understood and demonstrates the value of their use in collaborative analytical teams. This is a book that should be used for teaching, but analysts and managers alike should have it beside them when undertaking analysis or making decisions.

—Gillian Wilson, retired inspector, Victorian Police; life member, Australian Institute of Professional Intelligence Officers

Pherson and Heuer's third edition of Structured Analytic Techniques consolidates its place as the go to source for teaching and learning SATs. In an ever increasing, complex security environment, this edition will help practitioners navigate the shoals of uncertainty, deception, and information overload for decision-makers.

—Dr. Patrick F. Walsh, associate professor, Charles Sturt University, Australia

This is a must-read and essential reference guide for all intelligence analysts. In simple, clear language, Pherson and Heuer outline key structured techniques that when applied result in better quality, higher impact analysis. Kudos to the authors for providing an invaluable resource to the intelligence community.

—Scott Leeb, head of knowledge, Fragomen LLC; former senior intelligence officer

Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis is a comprehensive and accessibly written text that will be of interest to both novices and professionals alike. Its comprehensive coverage of analytic techniques, and the analytic process, make this work an essential reading for students of intelligence analysis.

A comprehensive handbook on analytic techniques.

— Christopher K. Lamont, University of Groningen; associate professor, Tokyo International University

In these pages, we start to understand the role of cognitive bias, the value of words, the value of being. The authors bring you back to the base. If our instincts spur our brain to action, knowing the base helps you anticipate the ideas and recognize the mindsets. In the field of intelligence analysis, if you don't understand this, you will never make sense of how others behave.

—Sabrina Magris, École Universitaire Internationale, Rome, Italy

Excellent publication for the study of intelligence analysis, structured analytical techniques and their application in this increasingly dangerous environment. A must-read for anyone entering the intelligence community as an analyst, practitioner, stakeholder and leader.

— Charles E. Wilson, University of Detroit Mercy

Former Deputy Director and Acting Director of Central Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency

A s intensively as America's Intelligence Community has been studied and critiqued, little attention has typically been paid to intelligence analysis. Most assessments focus on such issues as overseas clandestine operations and covert action, perhaps because they accord more readily with popular images of the intelligence world.

And yet, analysis has probably never been a more important part of the profession—or more needed by policymakers. In contrast to the bipolar dynamics of the Cold War, this new world is strewn with failing states, proliferation dangers, regional crises, rising powers, and dangerous non-state actors—all at play against a backdrop of exponential change in fields as diverse as population and technology.

To be sure, there are still precious secrets that intelligence collection must uncover—things that are knowable and discoverable. But this world is equally rich in mysteries having to do more with the future direction of events and the intentions of key actors. Such things are rarely illuminated by a single piece of secret intelligence data; they are necessarily subjects for analysis.

Analysts charged with interpreting this world would be wise to absorb the thinking in this book by Randolph Pherson and Richards J. Heuer Jr. and in Heuer's earlier work, Psychology of Intelligence Analysis . The reasons are apparent if one considers the ways in which intelligence analysis differs from similar fields of intellectual endeavor.

Intelligence analysts must traverse a minefield of potential errors:

First, they typically must begin addressing their subjects where others have left off; in most cases the questions they get are about what happens next, not about what is known. Second, they cannot be deterred by lack of evidence. As Heuer pointed out in his earlier work, the essence of the analysts' challenge is having to deal with ambiguous situations in which information is never complete and arrives only incrementally—but with constant pressure to arrive at conclusions. Third, analysts must frequently deal with an adversary that actively seeks to deny them the information they need and is often working hard to deceive them. Finally, for all of these reasons, analysts live with a high degree of risk—essentially the risk of being wrong and thereby contributing to ill-informed policy decisions.

The risks inherent in intelligence analysis can never be eliminated, but one way to minimize them is through more structured and disciplined thinking about thinking. On that score, I tell my students at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies that the Heuer book is probably the most important reading I give them, whether they are heading into the government or the private sector. Intelligence analysts should reread it frequently. In addition, Randolph Pherson's work over the past decade and a half to develop and refine a suite of Structured Analytic Techniques offers invaluable assistance by providing analysts with specific techniques they can use to combat mindsets, Groupthink, and all the other potential pitfalls of dealing with ambiguous data in circumstances that require clear and consequential conclusions.

The book you now hold augments Heuer's pioneering work by offering a clear and more comprehensive menu of more than sixty techniques to build on the strategies he earlier developed for combating perceptual errors. The techniques range from fairly simple exercises that a busy analyst can use while working alone—the Key Assumptions Check, Indicators Validation, or What If? Analysis—to more complex techniques that work best in a group setting—Cluster Brainstorming, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses, or Premortem Analysis.

The key point is that all analysts should do something to test the conclusions they advance. To be sure, expert judgment and intuition have their place—and are often the foundational elements of sound analysis—but analysts are likely to minimize error to the degree they can make their underlying logic explicit in the ways these techniques demand.

Just as intelligence analysis has seldom been more important, the stakes in the policy process it informs have rarely been higher. Intelligence analysts these days therefore have a special calling, and they owe it to themselves and to those they serve to do everything possible to challenge their own thinking and to rigorously test their conclusions. The strategies offered by Randolph Pherson and Richards J. Heuer Jr. in this book provide the means to do precisely that.

前言

前中央情报局副局长兼代理局长

尽管美国情报界受到了广泛的研究和批评，但情报分析却很少受到关注。大多数评估集中在海外秘密行动和隐蔽行动等问题上，可能是因为这些问题更符合公众对情报世界的想象。

然而，分析在这个职业中的重要性可能从未如此之高 —— 政策制定者对它的需求也从未如此迫切。与冷战时期的两极对立不同，当今世界充满了失败的国家、扩散的危险、区域危机、崛起的大国和危险的非国家行为者 —— 所有这些都在人口增长和科技进步中迅速变化的背景下相互作用。

当然，仍然有一些宝贵的秘密需要情报收集来揭露 —— 这些是可知的和可发现的。但这个世界同样充满了与事件未来方向和关键行为者意图有关的谜团。这些事情很少能通过单一的秘密情报数据来阐明；它们必然是分析的主题。

负责解释这个世界的分析师明智的做法是吸收兰多夫·费森和理查兹·J·霍尔的《心理学情报分析》一书中的思想，以及霍尔之前的作品。如果考虑到情报分析与类似智力领域的工作有何不同，原因就显而易见了。

情报分析师必须穿越一个充满潜在错误的雷区：

首先，分析人员往往需要从他人研究的中断点继续深入，他们面对的问题多是关于未来的发展，而非已知的事实。其次，他们不能因证据不足而退缩。正如休尔在其早期著作中所述，分析人员的核心挑战在于处理信息不完整且逐步呈现的模糊情境，同时承受着必须得出结论的压力。第三，分析人员常常要与那些刻意阻碍他们获取信息并试图欺骗他们的对手较量。最后，由于这些因素，分析人员承担着高风险 —— 即可能因判断失误而导致不明智的政策决策。

尽管情报分析的风险无法根除，但通过更加结构化和有纪律的思考，可以有效降低这些风险。因此，我向约翰霍普金斯大学高级国际研究学院的学生们推荐休尔的书籍，无论他们将来投身于政府还是私营部门，这本书都是极其重要的阅读材料。情报分析人员应当定期重温这本书。此外，兰多夫·费森在过去十五年中开发和完善的一系列结构化分析技术，为分析人员提供了宝贵的工具，帮助他们克服思维定势和群体思维，以及在需要做出明确且有重大影响的判断时，处理那些模糊不清的数据。

您手中的这本书是对 Heuer 先驱性工作的进一步发展，它提供了一个包含六十多种技术的清晰而全面的指南，这些技术旨在增强 Heuer 早期为减少感知偏差而设计的策略。这些技术包括简单易行的练习，如关键假设检查、指标验证或假设情景分析，适合忙碌的分析师单独使用；也包括更复杂的集体活动，如集群头脑风暴、竞争假设分析或事前分析。

重要的是，每位分析师都应该采取措施来验证他们提出的结论。虽然专家的判断和直觉在分析中占有重要地位，是构建坚实分析的基石，但通过这些技术明确展示分析的内在逻辑，分析师能够有效减少错误的发生。

在情报分析的重要性日益凸显的今天，它在政策制定过程中的影响也达到了前所未有的高度。因此，情报分析师肩负着特殊的责任，他们需要不断挑战自己的思维，严格检验自己的结论。Randolph Pherson 和 Richards J. Heuer Jr. 在这本书中提供的策略，正是帮助分析师实现这一目标的工具。

## Preface: Origin and Purpose

The investigative commissions that followed the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the erroneous 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction clearly documented the need for a new approach to how analysis is conducted in the U.S. Intelligence Community. Attention focused initially on the need for "alternative analysis"—techniques for questioning conventional wisdom by identifying and analyzing alternative explanations or outcomes. This approach was later subsumed by a broader effort to transform the tradecraft of intelligence analysis by using what have become known as Structured Analytic Techniques. Structured analysis involves a step-by-step process that externalizes an individual analyst's thinking in a manner that makes it readily apparent to others, thereby enabling it to be shared, built on, and critiqued by others. When combined with the intuitive judgment of subject-matter experts, such a structured and transparent process can significantly reduce the risk of analytic error.

Our current high-tech, global environment increasingly requires collaboration among analysts with different areas of expertise and different organizational perspectives. Structured Analytic Techniques are ideal for this interaction. Each step in a technique prompts relevant discussion, and, typically, this generates more divergent information and more new ideas than any unstructured group process. The step-by-step process of Structured Analytic Techniques organizes the interaction among analysts in a small analytic group or team in a way that helps avoid the multiple pathologies that often degrade group or team performance.

Progress in the development and use of Structured Analytic Techniques has been steady since the publication of the first edition of this book in 2011. By defining the domain of Structured Analytic Techniques and providing a manual for using and testing these techniques, the first edition laid the groundwork for continuing improvement in how analysis is done within the U.S. Intelligence Community and a growing number of foreign intelligence services. Since then, the techniques have also made significant inroads into academic curricula and the business world. New techniques that the authors developed to fill gaps in what is currently available for intelligence analysis and that have broad applicability elsewhere are introduced in this book for the first time.

The second edition of the book added several techniques including Venn Analysis, Cone of Plausibility, Decision Trees, and the Impact Matrix and made significant revisions to Red Hat Analysis and the process of evaluating the diagnosticity of Indicators. The second edition also introduced the concepts of System 1 and System 2 Thinking (intuitive versus analytic approaches to thinking) and described ways to make the use of core structured techniques a daily habit for analysts.

In the third edition, we dropped several contrarian techniques and four critical thinking techniques that are described fully in a companion book, Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence . 1 That allowed us to add several new techniques including Analysis by Contrasting Narratives, Counterfactual Reasoning, Inconsistencies Finder™, Opportunities Incubator™, Bowtie Analysis, Critical Path Analysis, and two techniques for discovering key drivers. We substantially expanded the discussion of cognitive biases, misapplied heuristics, and intuitive traps and mapped which of the sixty-six structured techniques described in this edition are most effective in mitigating the impact of these cognitive limitations.

As the use of Structured Analytic Techniques becomes more widespread, we anticipate that the ways these techniques are used will continue to change. Our goal is to keep up with these changes in future editions, so we welcome your suggestions, at any time, for updating this third edition or otherwise enhancing its utility. To facilitate the use of these techniques, CQ Press/SAGE published the second edition of Cases in Intelligence Analysis: Structured Analytic Techniques in Action , with seventeen case studies and detailed exercises and lesson plans for learning how to use and teach twenty-eight of the Structured Analytic Techniques.

Audience for This Book

This book is for practitioners, managers, teachers, and students in the intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security communities, as well as in academia, business, medicine, and elsewhere in the private sector. Managers, policymakers, corporate executives, strategic planners, action officers, and operators who depend on input from analysts to help them achieve their goals will also find it useful. Academics and consultants who specialize in qualitative methods for dealing with unstructured data will be interested in this pathbreaking book as well.

Many of the techniques described here relate to strategic intelligence, but almost all the techniques should be of interest to law enforcement, counterterrorism, and competitive intelligence analysts, as well as to business consultants, lawyers, doctors, and financial planners with a global perspective. Many techniques developed for these related fields have been adapted for use in intelligence analysis, and now we are starting to see the transfer of knowledge going in the other direction. Techniques such as Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), Key Assumptions Check, Quadrant Crunching™, and Indicators Validation and Evaluation developed specifically for intelligence analysts are now being adapted for use in other fields, such as law, medicine, and financial intelligence.

Content and Design

The first four chapters describe structured analysis in general, how it fits into the spectrum of methods used by analysts, how to select which techniques are most suitable for your analytic project, and the value of integrating these techniques into collaborative team projects. The next six chapters describe when, why, and how to use six families of structured techniques. The final chapter provides a vision of how these techniques are likely to be used in the year 2030.

We designed the book for ease of use and quick reference. The spiral binding allows analysts to have the book open while they follow step-by-step instructions for each technique. In this edition, we regrouped the techniques into six families based on the analytic production process. Tabs separating each chapter contain a table of contents for the selected chapter. For each family of techniques, we provide an overarching description of that category and then a brief summary of each technique covered in that chapter.

前言：起源与目的

未找到意译内容

自 2011 年本书第一版问世以来，结构化分析技术的发展和应用已经稳步推进。第一版为结构化分析技术设定了明确的范畴，并提供了使用和测试这些技术的实用指南，为美国情报界以及越来越多的国际情报机构在分析方法上的持续进步做出了基础性贡献。这些技术不仅在情报领域内得到了广泛应用，也逐渐渗透到了学术教育和商业实践中。本书首次引入了作者开发的新技术，旨在填补现有情报分析工具的不足，并展示了这些技术在多个领域的广泛应用潜力。

第二版在原有基础上增加了维恩图分析、可能性锥模型、决策树和影响矩阵等分析工具，并对红帽分析法和指标诊断性评估流程进行了重要更新。此外，第二版还介绍了系统 1 和系统 2 两种思维模式（分别代表直觉型和分析型思维），并探讨了如何将核心结构化技术融入分析人员的日常工作中。

在第三版中，我们删减了一些逆向思维和批判性思维的技术，这些内容在另一本名为《战略情报的批判性思维》的书中得到了详细阐述。这样的调整为我们引入了新的分析技术，如通过对比叙事进行分析、反事实推理、不一致性检测工具、机会创造工具、蝴蝶结分析、关键路径分析以及两种识别关键驱动因素的方法。我们对认知偏差、启发式误用和直觉陷阱的讨论进行了大幅扩展，并详细说明了本版中介绍的六十六种结构化技术如何有效地帮助分析人员克服这些认知障碍。

随着结构化分析技术的应用日益普及，我们预见到这些技术的应用方式将持续演变。我们的目标是在未来的版本中紧跟这些变化，因此我们随时欢迎您提出对第三版的更新建议，或提供其他增强其实用性的想法。为了推动这些技术的应用，CQ Press/SAGE 推出了《情报分析案例：结构化分析技术在行动》第二版，该书包含了十七个案例研究，以及详细的练习和教学计划，旨在帮助读者学习和教授二十八种结构化分析技术。

本书的目标读者包括情报、执法、国土安全领域的专业人士、管理人员、教育工作者和学生，同时也适用于学术界、商业、医学等私营部门的从业者。对于那些依赖分析师提供的信息来达成目标的管理者、政策制定者、企业领导人、战略规划者、行动官员和操作人员来说，本书同样具有重要价值。此外，专注于处理非结构化数据的定性方法研究的学者和顾问，也会对这本开创性的书籍产生浓厚兴趣。

许多本书中描述的技术与战略情报紧密相关，但它们同样对执法、反恐、竞争情报领域的分析师具有吸引力，也对那些具有全球视野的商业顾问、律师、医生和财务规划师具有重要价值。原本为情报分析开发的技术，如竞争假设分析（ACH）、关键假设检查、Quadrant Crunching™和指标验证与评估等，现在正被应用于法律、医学和金融情报等其他领域，这标志着知识转移的方向正在发生变化。

内容与设计本书的前四章全面介绍了结构化分析，探讨了它在分析师所用方法中的定位，指导读者如何为特定的分析项目选择最合适的技术，并强调了将这些技术融入团队协作项目的重要性。随后的六章详细阐述了六种结构化技术家族的运用时机、原因和方法。最后一章则展望了到 2030 年，这些技术可能的发展和应用前景。

为了便于读者使用和快速查阅，本书采用了螺旋装订设计，使得分析师在按照步骤学习每种技术时可以轻松翻阅。在这一版本中，我们根据分析生产流程将技术重新分类为六个家族，并在每个章节的标签上提供了该章节的目录。对于每种技术家族，我们首先给出该类别的概述，然后为该章节中介绍的每种技术提供简要的总结。
