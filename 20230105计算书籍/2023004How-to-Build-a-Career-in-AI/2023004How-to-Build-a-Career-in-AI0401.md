## 0401. Scoping Successful AI Projects

One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth working on. These next few chapters will discuss finding and working on projects so you can gain experience and build your portfolio.

Over the years, I’ve had fun applying machine learning to manufacturing, healthcare, climate change, agriculture, ecommerce, advertising, and other industries. How can someone who’s not an expert in all these sectors find meaningful projects within them? Here are five steps to help you scope projects.

Step 1

Identify a business problem (not an AI problem). I like to find a domain expert and ask, “What are the top three things that you wish worked better? Why aren’t they working yet?” For example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you might discover that power-grid operators can’t accurately predict how much power intermittent sources like wind and solar might generate in the future.

Step 2

Brainstorm AI solutions. When I was younger, I used to execute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes this worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing an even better idea that might not have taken any more effort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can brainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, to predict power generation from intermittent sources, we might consider using satellite imagery to map the locations of wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery to estimate the height and generation capacity of wind turbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover and thus solar irradiance. Sometimes there isn’t a good AI solution, and that’s okay too.

Step 3

Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions. You can determine whether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work, what competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept implementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain experts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the potential solutions mentioned above).

Step 4

Determine milestones. Once you’ve deemed a project sufficiently valuable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This includes both machine learning metrics (such as accuracy) and business metrics (such as revenue). Machine learning teams are often most comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize. But we may need to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up with business metrics, such as those related to user engagement, revenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be reduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren’t able to determine reasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more about the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the missing perspective.

Step 5

Budget for resources. Think through everything you’ll need to get the project done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or support you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds to purchase satellite imagery, make sure that’s in the budget.

Working on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is infeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. Is there a domain that excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it through project work — even if you don’t yet have deep expertise in that field. AI won’t solve every problem, but as a community, let’s look for ways to make a positive impact wherever we can.

确定成功人工智能项目的范围

人工智能架构师最重要的技能之一是识别值得研究的想法的能力。接下来的几章将讨论寻找和从事项目，这样你就可以获得经验并建立你的投资组合。

多年来，我一直乐于将机器学习应用于制造业、医疗保健、气候变化、农业、电子商务、广告和其他行业。一个不是所有这些领域的专家的人怎么能在其中找到有意义的项目呢？这里有五个步骤可以帮助你确定项目范围。

步骤 1

识别一个业务问题（不是 AI 问题）。我喜欢找一个领域专家问，「你希望效果更好的前三件事是什么？为什么他们还不工作？」例如，如果你想将人工智能应用于气候变化，你可能会发现电网运营商无法准确预测风能和太阳能等间歇性能源未来可能产生多少电力。

步骤 2

集思广益 AI 解决方案。当我年轻的时候，我经常执行我兴奋的第一个想法。有时这还不错，但有时我会错过一个更好的想法，这个想法可能不需要更多的努力就可以实现。一旦你理解了一个问题，你就可以更有效地头脑风暴潜在的解决方案。例如，为了预测间歇性来源的发电量，我们可以考虑使用卫星图像来更准确地绘制风力涡轮机的位置，使用卫星图像来估计风力涡轮机的高度和发电能力，或者使用天气数据来更好地预测云量，从而预测太阳辐照度。有时候没有好的人工智能解决方案，这也没关系。

步骤 3

评估潜在解决方案的可行性和价值。您可以通过查看已发布的工作、竞争对手已经做了什么，或者构建一个快速的概念验证实现来确定一种方法在技术上是否可行。您可以通过咨询领域专家（比如电网运营商，他们可以就上述潜在解决方案的效用提出建议）来确定其价值。

步骤 4

确定里程碑。一旦你认为一个项目足够有价值，下一步就是确定目标指标 。这既包括机器学习指标（如准确性），也包括业务指标（如收入）。机器学习团队通常最熟悉学习算法可以优化的指标。但是我们可能需要超越我们的舒适区来提出业务指标，例如与用户参与度、收入等相关的指标。不幸的是，并不是每个业务问题都可以简化为优化测试集的准确性！如果你不能确定合理的里程碑，这可能是一个信号，表明你需要更多地了解这个问题。快速的概念验证有助于补充缺失的视角。

步骤 5 资源预算。仔细考虑完成项目所需的一切，包括数据、人员、时间以及您可能需要其他团队提供的任何集成或支持。例如，如果你需要资金购买卫星图像，确保在预算之内。

项目工作是一个迭代过程。如果，在任何一步，你发现当前的方向是不可行的，回到更早的一步，继续你的新理解。有没有一个领域让你兴奋，人工智能可能会有所作为？我希望这些步骤能引导你通过项目工作来探索它 —— 即使你在那个领域还没有很深的专业知识。AI 不会解决所有问题，但作为一个社区，让我们尽可能地寻找产生积极影响的方法。
