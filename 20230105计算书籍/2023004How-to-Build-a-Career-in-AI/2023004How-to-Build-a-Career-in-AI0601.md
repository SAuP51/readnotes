## 0601. Building a Portfolio of Projects that Shows Skill Progression

Over the course of a career, you’re likely to work on projects in succession, each growing in

scope and complexity. For example:

1 Class projects:

The first few projects might be narrowly scoped homework assignments with predetermined right answers. These are often great learning experiences!

2 Personal projects

You might go on to work on small-scale projects either alone or with friends. For instance, you might re-implement a known algorithm, apply machine learning to a hobby (such as predicting whether your favorite sports team will win), or build a small but useful system at work in your spare time (such as a machine learning-based script that helps a colleague automate some of their work). Participating in competitions such as those organized by Kaggle is also one way to gain experience.

3 Creating value

Eventually, you will gain enough skill to build projects in which others see more tangible value. This opens the door to more resources. For example, rather than developing machine learning systems in your spare time, it might become part of your job, and you might gain access to more equipment , compute time, labeling budget, or head count.

4 Rising scope and complexity

Successes build on each other, opening the door to more technical growth, more resources, and increasingly significant project opportunities.

Each project is only one step on a longer journey, hopefully one that has a positive impact. In addition:

Don’t worry about starting too small. One of my first machine learning research projects involved training a neural network to see how well it could mimic the sin(x) function. It wasn’t very useful, but was a great learning experience that enabled me to move on to bigger projects.

Communication is key. You need to be able to explain your thinking if you want others to see the value in your work and trust you with resources that you can invest in larger projects. To get a project started, communicating the value of what you hope to build will help bring colleagues, mentors, and managers onboard — and help them point out flaws in your reasoning. After you’ve finished, the ability to explain clearly what you accomplished will help convince others to open the door to larger projects.

Leadership isn’t just for managers. When you reach the point of working on larger AI projects that require teamwork, your ability to lead projects will become more important, whether or not you are in a formal position of leadership. Many of my friends have successfully pursued a technical rather than managerial career, and their ability to help steer a project by applying deep technical insights — for example, when to invest in a new technical architecture or collect more data of a certain type — allowed them to grow as leaders and also helped significantly improve the project.

Building a portfolio of projects, especially one that shows progress over time from simple to complex undertakings, will be a big help when it comes to looking for a job.

建立显示技能进步的项目组合

在职业生涯中，你可能会连续参与项目，每个项目的范围和复杂性都在增长。例如：

1、班级项目。

最初的几个项目可能是范围狭窄的家庭作业，有预先确定的正确答案。这些往往是很棒的学习经历！

2、个人项目。

你可能会继续独自或与朋友一起从事小规模的项目。例如，您可能会重新实现一个已知的算法，将机器学习应用于一项爱好（例如预测您最喜欢的运动队是否会获胜），或者在业余时间构建一个小型但有用的工作系统（例如一个基于机器学习的脚本，帮助同事自动化他们的一些工作）。参加 Kaggle 组织的比赛也是获得经验的一种方式。

3、创造价值。

最终，你将获得足够的技能来构建其他人看到更多有形价值的项目。这打开了获取更多资源的大门。例如，它可能会成为你工作的一部分，而不是在业余时间开发机器学习系统，你可能会获得更多的设备、计算时间、标签预算或人数。

4、不断扩大的范围和复杂性。

成功建立在彼此的基础上，为更多的技术发展、更多的资源和越来越重要的项目机会打开了大门。

每个项目都只是漫长旅程中的一步，希望能产生积极的影响。此外：

不要担心起步太小。我的第一个机器学习研究项目之一涉及训练一个神经网络，看看它能在多大程度上模仿 sin(x) 函数。这不是很有用，但是是一次很好的学习经历，使我能够继续进行更大的项目。交流是 fiey。如果你想让别人看到你工作的价值，并信任你可以投资于更大项目的资源，你需要能够解释你的想法。得到一个项目开始了，传达你希望建立的东西的价值将有助于吸引同事、导师和经理参与进来，并帮助他们指出你推理中的缺陷。完成后，清楚地解释你完成了什么的能力将有助于说服其他人打开更大项目的大门。领导力不仅仅是管理者的事。当你从事需要团队合作的大型人工智能项目时，你领导项目的能力将变得更加重要，不管你是不是处于正式的领导地位。我的许多朋友都成功地从事技术职业，而不是管理职业，他们通过运用深刻的技术见解来帮助指导项目的能力 —— 例如，何时投资于一个新的技术架构或收集某种类型的更多数据 —— 让他们成长为领导者，也有助于显著改进项目。

建立一个项目组合，尤其是一个显示从简单到复杂的项目随着时间的推移取得进展的项目组合，在找工作时会有很大的帮助。
