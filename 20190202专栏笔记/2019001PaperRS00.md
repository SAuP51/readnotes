### 0001. 反常识卡 —— 编程后期特定语言知识逐渐弱化

信息源自「2019036The-Key-to-Accelerating-Your-Coding-Skills.md」

The biggest consequence of the inflection point will sound a bit counterintuitive when you first hear it. Take a deep breath in:

When learning to code, domain-specific knowledge doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

1-2『赞成作者的观点，熟悉计算机底层知识，编程达到一定水平后，「语言」的限制大大减弱了，可以快速的切换到另外一个语言。做一张反常识卡。（2021-05-04）』—— 已完成

Yup. I'm not joking – it really doesn't matter that much at all. Once you pass the inflection point, these concepts will fluidly translate with just a week or two of tutorials, maybe even days!

What ultimately really matters is:

1 You have a solid grasp on a web development framework.

2 You have a solid grasp on writing algorithmically complex code in any programming language.

Hiring managers want developers with solid web development and algorithm skills.

While I was working at PayPal, my team hired a Senior Rails Developer who had no experience in Rails – he had been coding a lot in Python, LISP, and Perl. Within a couple of days, he was already making a big impact. And within weeks: a huge impact. He quickly rose to become the technical team lead and was one of the best hiring decisions I've ever been involved in.

Don't sweat the stack. Many people will say things like, "AngularJS is hot these days," "JavaScript is on the rise," or "the latest fad is…" My response to that is: "so?" When you're learning how to program, your singular goal should be to find the inflection point and annihilate it. Once you do, learning that new, sexy fad won't be a difficult task at all.

Become self-reliant. Having the ability to learn new coding skills without structured guidance means you no longer need to wait for anyone to help you out. This means that for the majority of what you need to learn, you can simply search the internet and read the various material on what you need to know.

This doesn't mean you immediately "know" everything, but just that everything is now "figure-out-able," so in essence, you are unstoppable.

### 0101. 主题卡 ——

这本书的主题核心，就是最大的反常识卡，并且注意时间脉络。

### 0201. 术语卡 ——

根据反常识，再补充三个证据——就产生三张术语卡。

### 0202. 术语卡 ——

### 0203. 术语卡 ——

### 0301. 人名卡 ——

根据这些证据和案例，找出源头和提出术语的人是谁——产生一张人名卡，并且分析他为什么牛，有哪些作品，生平经历是什么。

### 0401. 金句卡 ——

最后根据他写的非常震撼的话语——产生一张金句卡。

### 0501. 行动卡 ——

行动卡是能够指导自己的行动的卡。

### 0601. 数据信息卡 ——

### 0701. 任意卡 ——

最后还有一张任意卡，记录个人阅读感想。
