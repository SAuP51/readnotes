can help you on your path. In this chapter, you discover ten of the most

useful places to turn to when you need an extra push in the right direction.

Letting Excel Write Code for You

One of the best places to get macro help is the macro recorder in Excel. When you

record a macro with the macro recorder, Excel writes the underlying VBA for you.

After recording, you can review the code, see what the recorder did, and then try

to turn the code it creates into something more suited to your needs.

For example, say you need a macro that refreshes all the pivot tables in your

workbook and clears all the filters in each pivot table. Writing this macro from a

blank canvas would be a daunting task. Instead, you can start the macro recorder

and record yourself refreshing all the pivot tables and clearing all the filters. After you stop recording, you can review the macro and make any changes you deem

necessary.

Need a refresher on using the macro recorder? Pop over to Chapter 6, where you

can find a detailed overview.

To a new Excel user, the Help system may seem like a clunky add-in that returns

a perplexing list of topics that has nothing to do with the original topic being

searched. The truth is, however, after you learn how to use the Excel Help system

effectively, it's often the fastest and easiest way to get extra help on a topic.

You need to remember two basic tenets of the Excel Help system:

» Location matters when asking for help.  Excel actually has two Help systems: one providing help on Excel features and another providing help on VBA

programming topics. Instead of doing a global search with your criteria, Excel

throws your search criteria only against the Help system that's relevant to your

current location. This essentially means that the help you get is determined

by the area of Excel in which you're working. So, if you need help on a topic

that involves macros and VBA programming, you need to be in the VBE while

performing your search. This ensures that your keyword search is performed

on the correct Help system.

» Online help is better than offline help.  When you search for help on a

topic, Excel checks to see if you're connected to the Internet. If you are, Excel

returns help results based on online content from Microsoft's website. If you

aren't, Excel uses the Help files that are locally stored with Microsoft Office.

Online help is generally better because the content is often more detailed

and includes updated information, as well as links to other resources

not available offline.

Pilfering Code from the Internet

The dirty secret about programming in the Internet-age is that there is no origi-

nal code anymore. All the macro syntax that will ever be needed has been docu-

mented somewhere on the Internet. In many ways, programming has become less

about the code you can create from scratch, and more about how to take existing

code and apply it creatively to a particular scenario.

If you're stuck trying to create a macro for a particular task, describe the task you're trying to accomplish via your favorite search engine. For the best results,

enter「Excel VBA」before your description.

For example, if you're trying to write a macro that deletes all blank rows in a worksheet, search for,「Excel VBA delete blank rows in a worksheet.」You can bet

two months' salary that someone has tackled the same problem and posted exam-

ple code that gives you the nugget of information you need to jump start ideas for

building your own macro.

Leveraging User Forums

If you find yourself in a bind, post your question in a forum to get customized

guidance based on your scenario.

User forums are online communities that revolve around a particular topic. In

these forums, you can post questions and have experts offer advise on how to solve

particular problems. The folks answering the questions are typically volunteers who have a passion for helping the community solve real-world challenges.

Many forums are dedicated to all things Excel. To find an Excel Forum, type「Excel

Forum」in your favorite search engine.

Here are a few tips for getting the most out of user forums:

» Always read and follow the forum rules before you get started.  These

rules often include advice on posting question and community etiquette

guidelines.

» Check whether your question has already been asked and answered.

Why not save time by leveraging the forum's archive of questions? Take a

moment to search the forum to see whether your question has been asked

before.

CHAPTER 23  Resources for VBA Help    379

» Use concise and accurate subject titles for your questions.  Don't create

forum questions with abstract titles like: Need advice, or Please Help.

» Keep the scope of your questions as narrow as possible.  Don't ask

questions like: How do I build an invoicing macro in Excel.

» Be patient.  Remember the folks answering your questions are volunteers

who typically have day jobs. Give the community some time to answer your

question.

» Check back often.  After posting your question, you may receive requests for more details about your scenario. Do everyone a favor and return to your

posting to either review the answers or respond to follow-up questions.

» Thank the expert who answered your question.  If you receive an answer

that helps you, take a moment to post a thank you to the expert who helped

you out.
