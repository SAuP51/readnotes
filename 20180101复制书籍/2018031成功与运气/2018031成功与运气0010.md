[16] Some authors have suggested that the success of players born earlier in the year results less from the fact that they are actually better than from the fact that NHL teams perceive them as better.

[7] To be sure, a trait might be wasteful from the collective perspective of males, yet still not be dysfunctional for the relevant species. As biologists have long noted, sexually reproducing species have far more males than they need, so if bull elk are more easily caught and killed by wolves because of their large antlers, that may not much threaten the survival of their species. But that wasn't my point. The only claim I made on the basis of this example is that bulls would find survival to a ripe old age preferable to being killed and eaten prematurely.
