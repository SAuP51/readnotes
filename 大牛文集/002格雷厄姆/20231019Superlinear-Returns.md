One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear.

Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. "You get out," I heard a thousand times, "what you put in." They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.

It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer.[1]

You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.

当我还是个孩子的时候，我不了解这个世界最重要的一件事是表现回报的超线性程度。

老师和教练含蓄地告诉我们，回报是线性的。「你滚出去，」我听了一千遍，「你投入了什么。」他们的本意是好的，但这很少是真的。如果你的产品只有竞争对手的一半好，你就不会得到一半的客户。你没有顾客，你就倒闭了。

显然，在商业中，业绩回报是超线性的。有些人认为这是资本主义的一个缺陷，如果我们改变规则，这将不再是真的。

但性能的超线性回报是世界的一个特征，而不是我们发明的规则的产物。我们在名声、权力、军事胜利、知识，甚至对人类的利益方面都看到了同样的模式。在所有这些中，富人变得更富有。

如果不理解超线性收益的概念，你就无法理解这个世界。如果你雄心勃勃，你肯定应该这样做，因为这将是你冲浪的浪潮。

It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.

The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.

Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.

Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.

YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate "you get out what you put in," but it's not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performancepover timetwould be proportional topt.

Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling.

Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day.

What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially. 

Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. Therewasa way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life.

The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.[2]

That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it.

The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression "winner take all." In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better.[3]

The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target.

It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.

Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A- list in the average person's head.

The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.

超线性回报似乎有很多不同的情况，但据我所知，它们可以归结为两个根本原因：指数增长和阈值。

超线性回报最明显的情况是当你在做指数增长的事情时。例如，培养细菌。当它们生长时，它们呈指数级增长。但它们很难生长。这意味着擅长和不擅长的人在结果上的差异很大。

初创企业也可以呈指数级增长，我们在那里看到了同样的模式。一些国家设法实现了高增长率。大多数人没有。因此，你会得到质的不同结果：增长率高的公司往往会变得非常有价值，而增长率低的公司甚至可能无法生存。

Y Combinator 鼓励创始人关注增长率，而不是绝对数字。这可以防止他们在绝对数字仍然很低的时候被劝阻。这也有助于他们决定关注什么：你可以用增长率作为指南针来告诉你如何发展公司。但主要的优势是，通过关注增长率，你往往会得到指数级增长的东西。

YC 并没有明确告诉创始人，随着增长率的提高，「你投入什么就得到什么」，但这与事实并不遥远。如果增长率与绩效成正比，那么随着时间 t 的推移，绩效 p 的回报将与 pt 成正比。

即使经过几十年的思考，我还是觉得这句话令人震惊。

无论何时，你的表现取决于你的表现，你都会得到指数级的增长。但无论是我们的基因还是我们的习俗都没有为我们做好准备。没有人认为指数增长是自然的；每个孩子第一次听到这个故事时，都会惊讶于一个男人的故事，他第一天就向国王要一粒米，然后每天都要加倍。

我们不了解的东西自然会形成习惯来处理，但我们也没有太多关于指数增长的习惯，因为人类历史上很少有这种情况。原则上，放牧应该是一种：你养的动物越多，它们的后代就越多。但在实践中，牧场是一个限制因素，而且没有指数级增长的计划。

或者更准确地说，没有普遍适用的计划。有一种方法可以使自己的领土呈指数级增长：征服。你控制的领土越多，你的军队就越强大，就越容易征服新的领土。这就是为什么历史上充满了帝国。

但很少有人创建或经营帝国，他们的经历对习俗没有太大影响。皇帝是一个遥远而可怕的人物，不是一个人在自己的生活中可以吸取教训的来源。

前工业化时代指数增长最常见的情况可能是学术。你知道的越多，学习新东西就越容易。结果，当时和现在一样，有些人对某些话题的了解比其他人要多得多。但这对风俗习惯也没有太大影响。

尽管思想帝国可以重叠，因此可能会有更多的皇帝，但在前工业化时代，这种类型的帝国几乎没有实际效果。

在过去的几个世纪里，这种情况发生了变化。现在，有思想的皇帝可以设计炸弹来击败领土上的皇帝。但这种现象仍然很新，我们还没有完全吸收它。甚至很少有参与者意识到他们从指数增长中受益，或者问他们可以从其他情况中学到什么。

超线性回报的另一个来源体现在「赢者通吃」这句话中。在体育比赛中，表现和回报之间的关系是一个阶梯函数：无论他们做得更好还是稍微好一点，获胜的球队都会赢得一场胜利。

然而，阶跃函数的来源并不是竞争本身。结果是有门槛的。你不需要竞争就可以得到这些。在你是唯一参与者的情况下，比如证明定理或击中目标，可能会有阈值。

值得注意的是，一个有超线性回报来源的情况下，往往也有另一个。跨越阈值会导致指数级增长：战斗中获胜的一方通常受到的伤害较小，这使他们在未来更有可能获胜。指数增长有助于你跨越门槛：在一个具有网络效应的市场中，一家增长足够快的公司可以将潜在的竞争对手拒之门外。

名声是一个有趣的例子，它结合了超线性回报的两个来源。名气呈指数级增长，因为现有的粉丝会给你带来新的粉丝。但它如此集中的根本原因是阈值：在普通人的头脑中，A 级名单上只有这么多空间。

将超线性收益的两个来源结合起来的最重要的情况可能是学习。知识呈指数级增长，但其中也有门槛。例如，学习骑自行车。其中一些阈值类似于机床：一旦你学会了阅读，你就能更快地学习其他任何东西。

但最重要的阈值是那些代表新发现的阈值。知识似乎是分形的，因为如果你在一个知识领域的边界上努力，有时你会发现一个全新的领域。如果你这样做了，你会第一次看到其中的所有新发现。牛顿做到了，杜勒和达尔文也做到了。

### 03

Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.

There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless. 

This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually.

Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.

But don't over optimize what you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.

What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form "seek thresholds" or "seek competition?" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. "Seek competition" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape.[4]

A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one.[5]

It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problemisn'tlikely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to. 

有没有发现超线性回归情形的一般规则？最明显的一个是寻求化合物的工作。

工作有两种复合方式。它可以直接复合，因为在一个周期中做得好会让你在下一个周期做得更好。例如，当你在建设基础设施，或者扩大受众或品牌时，就会发生这种情况。或者工作可以通过教你来复合，因为学习复合。

第二种情况很有趣，因为你可能会觉得自己做得很糟糕。你可能无法实现眼前的目标。但是，如果你学到了很多，那么你仍然会得到指数级的增长。

这也是硅谷对失败如此宽容的原因之一。硅谷的人们不会盲目地容忍失败。只有当你从失败中吸取教训时，他们才会继续把赌注押在你身上。但如果你是，你实际上是一个很好的选择：也许你的公司没有按照你想要的方式发展，但你自己做到了，这最终应该会产生结果。

事实上，不包括学习的指数增长形式经常与之混合在一起，我们可能应该将其视为规则而不是例外。这产生了另一个启发：永远在学习。如果你没有学习，你可能没有走上一条导致超线性回报的道路。

但不要过度优化你正在学习的内容。不要局限于学习那些已知有价值的东西。你在学习；你还不确定什么是有价值的，如果你太严格，你会剔除异常值。

阶跃函数呢？是否还有「寻求阈值」或「寻求竞争」形式的有用启发法这里的情况更为棘手。门槛的存在并不能保证游戏值得一玩。如果你玩一轮俄罗斯轮盘赌，你肯定会遇到一个有门槛的情况，但在最好的情况下，你的境况也不会好到哪里去。

「寻求竞争」同样毫无用处；如果奖品不值得竞争怎么办？足够快的指数增长保证了回报曲线的形状和大小 —— 因为增长足够快的东西即使一开始很小，也会增长得很大 —— 但阈值只能保证形状。

利用阈值的原则必须包括一项测试，以确保游戏值得玩。有一个是这样的：如果你遇到一些平庸但仍然很受欢迎的东西，那么取代它可能是个好主意。例如，如果一家公司生产了一种人们不喜欢但仍然购买的产品，那么如果你生产了一个，他们可能会购买更好的替代品。

如果有一种方法可以找到有希望的智力门槛，那就太好了。有没有一种方法可以判断哪些问题有全新的领域？我怀疑我们是否能确定地预测这一点，但这个奖项是如此有价值，如果有比随机预测更好的预测因子，那将是有用的，而且有希望找到这些预测因子。

我们可以在某种程度上预测什么时候一个研究问题不太可能导致新的发现：什么时候它看起来合法但无聊。而那些能带来新发现的东西往往看起来很神秘，但也许并不重要。（如果它们令人费解且显然很重要，那么它们将是著名的开放式问题，很多人已经在研究它们了。）

因此，这里的一个启发是：由好奇心而不是野心驱动 —— 让你的好奇心自由发挥，而不是去做你应该做的事情。

### 04

The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing.

There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations.

Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.[6]

A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.

There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance. 

Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out.[7] 

The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.

对于雄心勃勃的人来说，超线性业绩回报的前景是令人兴奋的。这个部门有一个好消息：这个领域正在双向扩张。有更多类型的工作可以获得超线性回报，而且回报本身也在增长。

这有两个原因，尽管它们紧密交织在一起，更像是一个半原因：技术进步和组织的重要性下降。

50 年前，成为一个组织的一部分来从事雄心勃勃的项目是非常必要的。这是获得所需资源的唯一途径，也是拥有同事的唯一途径和获得分配的唯一途径。

所以在 1970 年，你的声望在大多数情况下都是你所属组织的声望。声望是一个准确的预测因素，因为如果你不是一个组织的一部分，你就不太可能取得多大成就。

也有少数例外，最著名的是艺术家和作家，他们独自使用廉价的工具工作，并拥有自己的品牌。但即使是他们，也要受组织的摆布才能接触到观众。

一个由组织主导的世界抑制了绩效回报的变化。但就在我有生之年，这个世界已经被严重侵蚀了。现在，更多的人可以拥有 20 世纪艺术家和作家所拥有的自由。有很多雄心勃勃的项目不需要太多的初始资金，还有很多学习、赚钱、寻找同事和接触观众的新方法。

旧世界还有很多，但以历史标准来看，变化的速度是巨大的。尤其是考虑到利害关系。很难想象会有比业绩回报更根本的变化。

如果没有制度的阻尼效应，结果就会有更多的变化。这并不意味着每个人都会过得更好：做得好的人会做得更好，但做得差的人会更糟。这是一个需要牢记的重要观点。

并不是每个人都能获得超线性回报。作为游泳池的一部分，大多数人会过得更好。那么，谁应该为超线性回报而投篮呢？雄心勃勃的人有两种：一种是知道自己非常优秀，在一个变化更大的世界里会遥遥领先的人，另一种是那些有能力冒险去发现的人，尤其是年轻人。

从机构的转变不仅仅是现有居民的外流。许多新的获奖者将是他们从未让人进入的人。因此，由此产生的机会民主化将比机构本身可能炮制的任何温和的内部版本都更大、更真实。

### 05

Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies.[8] But if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you. How should you take advantage of it? 

The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to.

There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it.[9] It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children. 

There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work. It's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot giving a recipe in one paragraph.

Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.[10]

And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early.

The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at the limits of knowledge.

The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries' combined.[11]

This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.

In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.

What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to beindependent-mindedto succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well.[12]

This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money.

What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first.At this rate,you find yourself thinking,I'll never get anywhere.But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.

In the startup world, the name for this principle is "do things that don't scale." If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get.

There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase "your work" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio.

It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one.

The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.

There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort, performance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, they're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error.

并不是每个人都对这种伟大的雄心释放感到高兴。它威胁到一些既得利益，并与一些意识形态相矛盾。但如果你是一个雄心勃勃的人，这对你来说是个好消息。你应该如何利用它？

利用超线性回报的最明显的方法是做非常好的工作。在曲线的另一端，增量努力是一笔划算的交易。

更重要的是，远端的竞争更少 —— 这不仅是因为很难把事情做得特别好，还因为人们觉得前景太可怕了，甚至很少有人尝试。这意味着这不仅仅是一笔做特殊工作的交易，甚至是一笔尝试的交易。

有很多变量会影响你的工作有多好，如果你想成为一个异类，你需要把几乎所有的变量都做好。例如，要想把某件事做得特别好，你必须对它感兴趣。仅仅勤奋是不够的。因此，在一个拥有超线性回报的世界里，知道自己对什么感兴趣，并找到解决问题的方法，就更有价值了。

选择适合自己情况的工作也很重要。例如，如果有一种工作本身就需要花费大量的时间和精力，那么在你年轻还没有孩子的时候做这项工作会越来越有价值。

做伟大的工作需要惊人的技巧。这不仅仅是一个努力的问题。我将尝试在一段话中给出一个食谱。

选择你有天赋和兴趣的工作。养成自己做项目的习惯；他们是什么并不重要，只要你发现他们雄心勃勃。尽你所能努力工作而不精疲力竭，这最终会把你带到知识的前沿之一。这些从远处看很光滑，但近距离看却充满了空隙。注意并探索这些差距，如果你幸运的话，其中一个将扩展到一个全新的领域。

尽可能多地承担风险；如果你不是偶尔失败，你可能是过于保守了。寻找最好的同事。培养良好的品味，学习最好的榜样。要诚实，尤其是对自己。锻炼身体，吃好睡好，避免服用更危险的药物。当有疑问时，跟随你的好奇心。它从不撒谎，而且它比你更清楚什么是值得关注的。

当然，你还需要一件事：幸运。运气总是一个因素，但当你独自工作而不是作为组织的一部分时，运气更是一个因素。尽管有一些关于运气的格言是有准备的地方遇到了机会等等，但真正的机会也有一个组成部分你无能为力。解决方法是多次拍摄。这也是尽早开始冒险的另一个原因。

一个具有超线性回报的领域最好的例子可能是科学。它以学习的形式呈指数级增长，再加上表现极限的阈值 —— 实际上是知识的极限。

其结果是科学发现中存在一定程度的不平等，相比之下，即使是最分层的社会的财富不平等也显得温和。牛顿的发现可以说比他同时代人的发现加起来还要伟大。

这一点可能看起来很明显，但最好把它说清楚。超线性回报意味着不平等。回报曲线越陡，结果的变化就越大。

事实上，超线性回报率和不等式之间的相关性如此之强，以至于它产生了另一种寻找这类工作的启发式方法：寻找少数大赢家胜过其他人的领域。一种每个人都做同样事情的工作不太可能是一种具有超线性回报的工作。

在哪些领域，少数大赢家的表现优于其他人？以下是一些显而易见的内容：体育、政治、艺术、音乐、表演、导演、写作、数学、科学、创业和投资。在体育运动中，这种现象是由于外部施加的阈值；你只需要快百分之几就能赢得每一场比赛。

在政治上，权力的增长与帝王时代一样。在其他一些领域（包括政治），成功很大程度上是由名气驱动的，名气有其自身的超线性增长来源。

但是，当我们排除体育、政治和名气的影响时，就会出现一个显著的模式：剩下的列表与你必须具有独立思想才能成功的领域列表完全相同 —— 你的想法不仅必须正确，而且必须新颖。

科学显然就是这样。你不能发表论文说别人已经说过的话。但例如，在投资方面也是如此。只有当大多数其他投资者不相信一家公司会做得很好时，相信这一点才有用；如果其他人都认为该公司会做得很好，那么它的股价已经反映了这一点，没有赚钱的空间。

我们还能从这些领域学到什么？在所有这些方面，你都必须付出最初的努力。超线性回报一开始似乎很小。以这种速度，你会发现自己在想，我永远不会有任何进展。但由于回报曲线在远端急剧上升，因此值得采取非同寻常的措施来实现这一目标。

在创业界，这一原则的名字是「做一些没有规模的事情」如果你对你最初的一小部分客户给予了荒谬的关注，理想情况下，你会通过口碑开始指数级增长。

但同样的原理也适用于任何呈指数级增长的事物。例如，学习。当你第一次开始学习某些东西时，你会感到失落。但是，最初努力站稳脚跟是值得的，因为你学得越多，就越容易。

在具有超线性返回的字段列表中还有另一个更微妙的教训：不要把工作等同于工作。在 20 世纪的大部分时间里，这两者几乎对每个人来说都是一样的，因此我们继承了一种将生产力等同于有工作的习俗。

即使是现在，对大多数人来说，「你的工作」也意味着他们的工作。但对于作家、艺术家或科学家来说，这意味着他们目前正在研究或创作的任何东西。对于这样的人来说，如果他们有工作的话，他们的工作就是他们从一份工作带到另一份工作的东西。这可能是为雇主做的，但这是他们投资组合的一部分。

进入一个少数大赢家胜过其他人的领域是一个令人生畏的前景。有些人这样做是故意的，但你不需要。如果你有足够的天生能力，并且足够深入地追随你的好奇心，你最终会成为一个。你的好奇心不会让你对无聊的问题感兴趣，而有趣的问题往往会产生具有超线性回报的领域，如果它们还不是其中的一部分的话。

超线性收益的领域绝非一成不变。事实上，最极端的回报来自于扩大它。因此，虽然野心和好奇心都能让你进入这个领域，但好奇心可能是两者中更强大的。野心往往会让你攀登现有的山峰，但如果你离一个足够有趣的问题足够近，它可能会在你脚下变成一座山。

[1] Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns. 

[1] 进化本身可能是表现的超线性回报的最普遍的例子。但这对我们来说很难感同身受，因为我们不是接受者；我们是回归者

[2] Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people. 

[2] 当然，知识在工业革命之前确实有实际影响。农业的发展彻底改变了人类的生活。但这种变化是技术上广泛而渐进的改进的结果，而不是几个特别有学问的人的发现。

[3] It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one would bother.

[3] 将阶跃函数描述为超线性在数学上是不正确的，但是当从零开始的阶跃函数描述理性行为者的努力回报曲线时，它就像一个超线性函数。如果它从零开始，那么阶跃之前的部分低于任何线性增加的回报，而阶跃之后的部分必须高于该点的必要回报，否则没有人会打扰。

[4] Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them promising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one. 

[4] 寻求竞争可能是一个很好的启发，因为有些人发现它激励。这也是一些有希望的问题的指南，因为这是其他人发现它们有希望的标志。但这是一个非常不完美的标志：往往有一群人吵吵嚷嚷地追逐着某个问题，结果他们都被另一个人悄悄地解决了。

[5] Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons. 

[5] 但也不总是这样。你必须小心这个规则。当一件东⻄虽然平庸却很受欢迎时，通常有一个隐藏的原因。也许是垄断或管制使竞争变得困难。也许顾客的品味很差，或者在决定买什么时打破了程序。有大量平庸的东⻄就是因为这样的原因而存在的。

[6] In my twenties I wanted to be anartistand even went to art school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least at the mercy of organizations.

[6] 在我二十多岁的时候，我想成为一名艺术家，甚至去艺术学校学习绘画。主要是因为我喜欢艺术，但我的动机的一个􏰁要部分来自这样一个事实，即艺术家似乎最不受组织的摆布。

[7] In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where the return curve gets really steep. 

[7] 原则上，每个人都能获得超线性回报。学习化合物，每个人都在生活中学习。但在实践中，很少有人把这种日常学习推到回报曲线变得非常陡峭的地步。

[8] It's unclear exactly what advocates of "equity" mean by it. They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than everyone else. 

It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance. 

[8] 目前还不清楚「公平」的倡导者到底是什么意思。他们之间似乎意⻅不一致。但无论他们的意思是什么，都可能与一个机构控制结果的权力较小，少数离群者比其他人做得更好的世界不一致。

这个概念出现在世界正朝着相反的方向转变的时刻，这似乎是运气不好，但我不认为这是巧合。我认为它现在出现的一个原因是因为它的追随者感到受到了快速增加的性能变化的威胁。

[9] Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past. 

[9] 推论：父母如果给孩子施加压力，让他们从事一些有声望的工作，比如医学，即使他们对医学没有兴趣，他们也会比过去更严厉地惩罚他们。

[10] The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of "How to Do Great Work." As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because after I finished "How to Do Great Work" I rewrote it based on that.

[10] 这一段的原始版本是《如何做伟大的工作》的初稿。「我一写这篇文章，就意识到这是一个比超线性回报更􏰁要的话题，所以我暂停了这篇文章，把这一段扩展成自己的内容。实际上，原始版本没有留下任何东⻄，因为在我完成「如何做伟大的工作」之后，我根据它􏰁写了它。

[11] Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist, by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most advanced economies the ratio hasshifted dramaticallytoward discovery just in the last half century. 

[11] 在工业革命之前，人们通常像皇帝一样致富：夺取一些资源使他们更强大，并使他们能够夺取更多。现在它可以像科学家一样，通过发现或建造一些独特的有价值的东⻄来完成。大多数人致富的方式都是新旧结合，但在最发达的经济体中，这一比例在上半个世纪就已经戏剧性地转向了发现。

[12] It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest drivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine what it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence. 

[12] 如果独立思想是不平等的最大驱动力之一，那么传统思想的人不喜欢不平等就不足为奇了。但这不仅仅是因为他们不想让任何人拥有他们不能拥有的东⻄。传统思想的人真的无法想象有新奇的想法是什么感觉。因此，在他们看来，表现的巨大差异这一现象是不自然的，当他们遇到这种现象时，他们认为这一定是由于作弊或某种恶意的外部影响。
